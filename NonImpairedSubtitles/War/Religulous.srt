1
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:39,565
This is it.

2
00:00:39,606 --> 00:00:41,164
I'm standing on the very spot

3
00:00:41,207 --> 00:00:44,370
where many Christians believe
the world will come to an end.

4
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,174
It's called Megiddo.

5
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:48,646
And it's the place that
the Book of Revelation says

6
00:00:48,681 --> 00:00:50,808
Jesus Christ
will come down to

7
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,978
to end the world and save
the people who believe in him.

8
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:56,511
Now when Revelations
was written,

9
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,491
only God had the capacity
to end the world,

10
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:02,723
but now man does too,
because unfortunately,

11
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:05,094
before man figured out
how to be rational

12
00:01:05,131 --> 00:01:08,032
or peaceful, he figured out
nuclear weapons

13
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:10,628
and how to pollute
on a catastrophic scale.

14
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:12,797
And if it's one thing
I hate more than prophecy,

15
00:01:12,839 --> 00:01:15,330
it's self-fulfilling prophecy.

16
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:21,243
Sometimes in your search
for happiness,

17
00:01:21,281 --> 00:01:23,772
you ponder the meaning
of your life.

18
00:01:23,817 --> 00:01:26,445
Who am I?
How did I come to be?

19
00:01:26,486 --> 00:01:29,353
Death, and then what?

20
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:33,652
I certainly honestly believe

21
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:35,957
religion is detrimental

22
00:01:35,995 --> 00:01:37,963
to the progress
of humanity.

23
00:01:37,997 --> 00:01:40,465
You know, it's just selling
an invisible product.

24
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:42,559
It's too easy.

25
00:01:42,602 --> 00:01:45,628
These questions
about what happens when you die,

26
00:01:45,672 --> 00:01:49,233
they so freak people out

27
00:01:49,275 --> 00:01:51,937
that they will
just make up any story

28
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,741
and cling to it.

29
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,907
You know, things that they know

30
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,747
can't be true,
people who are otherwise

31
00:01:58,785 --> 00:02:01,185
so rational about everything else,

32
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,018
and then they believe that

33
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:05,650
on Sunday
they're drinking the blood

34
00:02:05,692 --> 00:02:07,887
of a 2,000-year-old God.

35
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:11,363
I can't...
that's a dissonance in my head.

36
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,922
I can't... I have to find out.

37
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,367
I just have to find out.
I have to try.

38
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:44,727
This is the Mount of Olives.
This is Jesus's footprints.

39
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:46,527
We're here freezing our ass off.

40
00:02:52,705 --> 00:02:55,003
Is there anybody on the stage that

41
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,509
- does not believe in evolution?
- Yeah.

42
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:02,880
Hurry hurry hurry.

43
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,849
- I like my hat.
- You look good too.

44
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:11,149
Welcome to Bible Country!

45
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,182
"Birthplace of the Virgin Mary"?

46
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:18,826
I believe that God wants
everybody to be free.

47
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,833
That's what I believe,

48
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:24,530
and that's one part
of my foreign policy.

49
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:28,764
Bill, watch out.

50
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,610
Boy, do I feel cheap.

51
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:42,080
I want to thank God
for just blessing me so much.

52
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:44,055
Music has been
a blessing from God.

53
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,115
Thank you, Jesus!

54
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,027
You need a Holy Ghost enema
right up your rear end!

55
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,437
The archives are there on the fifth
floor where you see the curtains.

56
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:04,670
Yeah, put that away now.
Put that away.

57
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,408
If you look at my stand-up

58
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,043
from like the '80s... that era...

59
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:15,145
early '90s,

60
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:18,988
I talked about religion,
but I'm not ever questioning God.

61
00:04:19,025 --> 00:04:21,425
I'm just making fun
about things

62
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:23,588
in the religion...
circumcision.

63
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,393
Circumcision...
I mean, I would've loved

64
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:28,832
to have been there for
the first people to hear about this.

65
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:31,336
We're used to it now,
but you know, I mean,

66
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:33,236
I'm sure when Moses came
down with this idea,

67
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,673
there had to be one guy going,

68
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:37,903
"Let me get this straight."

69
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:40,276
It was just
a gentle poking fun at Him.

70
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:42,247
It's almost like
I'm roasting Him.

71
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,944
My mother is Jewish and my father
is Catholic. That is the truth.

72
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:46,747
I was raised Catholic formally,

73
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:49,084
although I must say
the Jewish mind comes out

74
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,352
even in the Catholic system.
I'll give you an example.

75
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:53,154
We used to go into confession

76
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,786
and I would bring
a lawyer in with me.

77
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,598
You know.

78
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,227
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

79
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:06,431
I think you know Mr. Cohen.

80
00:05:10,209 --> 00:05:13,144
So let me get out some pictures.

81
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:15,010
There's me.

82
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:17,278
We weren't brought up Jewish.

83
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:20,445
I didn't even know
we had that side,

84
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:22,511
so it was very Catholic.

85
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,716
We went to church
every Sunday,

86
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,021
but I wouldn't take off the gun

87
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,789
and really when I think back,

88
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:31,160
it wasn't relevant
to my life.

89
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:34,826
Superman was relevant
and baseball.

90
00:05:34,867 --> 00:05:37,427
We had this family

91
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:39,768
where one person
was Jewish

92
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,900
and the other three
were Catholic.

93
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,911
Now there it says
"A Sunday noon, fall '66,"

94
00:05:45,945 --> 00:05:49,540
so we must've
just gotten back from church,

95
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:51,675
'cause I'm in a red suit

96
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,653
and you're choking the dog.

97
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:58,384
And I guess we got home from church
and took a picture with you.

98
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:00,415
It never occurred to me to say,

99
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,654
"Why didn't you go to church?"

100
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,025
Mom...

101
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,690
what church do we belong to?

102
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:07,825
I don't remember
this ever coming up.

103
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,835
Of course you didn't go
to church with us.

104
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:12,497
No, we never had a family
discussion about it, never.

105
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:14,438
We never had
a family discussion about that.

106
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:17,932
Every family is dysfunctional.

107
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:21,276
So you thought even this,
which wasn't your religion,

108
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,544
was better than no religion.

109
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:26,950
Well, even this only
told you good things...

110
00:06:26,986 --> 00:06:28,578
I thought.

111
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,784
But it's just so shamelessly
invented as they go along.

112
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:35,419
- We can say that now.
- Was anyone...

113
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:37,827
When we quit
the church, I was 13,

114
00:06:37,864 --> 00:06:41,265
and I was of course thrilled,
but not for any ideological reason.

115
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,268
I was just thrilled
'cause I hated church.

116
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:45,133
It scared me.
It was boring.

117
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,036
I had to get up
on Sunday.

118
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:48,665
I was 13.

119
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:51,040
I would've worshiped anything
that could've allowed me

120
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:53,910
to masturbate even more
than I was masturbating

121
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:57,746
or get a girl. That god I would have
definitely worshipped.

122
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,775
Why do you remember

123
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,652
Dad stopped going to church?

124
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:05,156
We used birth control,

125
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,422
and the church frowned
on birth control.

126
00:07:08,461 --> 00:07:10,429
That was the biggest sin

127
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:13,762
- you could ever commit.
- Right, that would...

128
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,395
I think that was possibly...
he never said it to me.

129
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,565
And he never went back.
None of us ever did.

130
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,097
So now that we don't believe,

131
00:07:23,142 --> 00:07:24,769
where did...

132
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,642
Nobody said we don't believe.

133
00:07:26,679 --> 00:07:28,476
We don't believe in Catholicism.

134
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,114
Right, but what do
we believe in now?

135
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,553
Come on.
You're my mother, instruct me.

136
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,948
I don't know
the answer to that.

137
00:07:39,992 --> 00:07:41,425
That's my answer.

138
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:44,692
We'll take some back roads to see

139
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,960
- some interesting stuff out here.
- Take some back roads.

140
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:49,331
We are heading toward Raleigh, right?

141
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:51,802
Oh, yeah, man, can't you feel it?

142
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,526
Do I stand up here?
So as I was going here,

143
00:08:16,562 --> 00:08:19,292
I just jotted down
a few questions that came to my mind.

144
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:22,267
Are you ever bothered
by many things

145
00:08:22,301 --> 00:08:25,031
that are in Christianity
that are not in the Bible?

146
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,733
Like original sin.

147
00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:29,502
Immaculate conception.

148
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:33,478
The virgin birth is only
in two of the Gospels... popes.

149
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,539
Are you worried that these things
came not from the founders,

150
00:08:36,582 --> 00:08:38,880
the people that wrote
this book, but from...

151
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:41,045
and this is indisputable...
but from men,

152
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:43,021
from human beings
who came after?

153
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,580
And when I say men,
I mean people with penises.

154
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,421
If you wanna go back
to scientific proof,

155
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,453
I think it was determined
the shroud or whatever that was

156
00:08:51,497 --> 00:08:53,021
went around a while back...
I didn't get involved.

157
00:08:53,065 --> 00:08:56,034
- Shroud of Turin?
- They took blood samples from it,

158
00:08:56,068 --> 00:08:58,093
and it was female blood
with a male figure.

159
00:08:58,137 --> 00:09:00,605
Okay, the only possible way
that could happen was

160
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,700
that the Holy Ghost
impregnated Mary

161
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,711
because it would've
been female blood

162
00:09:05,745 --> 00:09:07,736
because it would've been
the only blood flowing through her.

163
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,308
- It's a faith thing.
- But why is faith good?

164
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:14,842
Why is believing something
without evidence good?

165
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:16,616
I don't like the way
this thing's going.

166
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:18,624
I don't know what
this documentary's supposed to be,

167
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:20,250
but I don't like
where you're going.

168
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:23,524
You start disputing my God,

169
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,862
and you got a problem.
I don't know what you...

170
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:30,198
I'm outta here. You do what
you wanna do, but I'm outta here.

171
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,563
- I'm just asking questions.
- Okay, no problem.

172
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:38,475
When I've seen what I've seen,
I know there's a God.

173
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:41,412
You can't change my mind.
Nobody can change my mind.

174
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:44,473
I walked for 30 years
as a Satanist priest.

175
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:46,644
From the time I grew up,
I was in Satanism.

176
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:49,154
For the last six years,
that I was into Satanism,

177
00:09:49,188 --> 00:09:51,281
I was a Satanist priest, okay?

178
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,417
- Real Satanism?
- Yes, real Satanism.

179
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:56,428
Being addicted to drugs,
and running prostitutes

180
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:58,487
and the women
and everything that goes with that.

181
00:09:58,531 --> 00:10:00,897
I walked around with rolls
of money in my pocket.

182
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:03,231
I gave all that up
when I got saved.

183
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,294
When the guy said,
"Yeah, I used to do drugs.

184
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:08,796
I used to have women,"
and I'm thinking,

185
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:12,140
- "And your problem was?"
- Right.

186
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,475
Let me ask you this question:

187
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,809
What if we're right
and you're wrong?

188
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,145
We gonna make it
and you ain't.

189
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,174
If you're being good
just to save your ass

190
00:10:19,218 --> 00:10:21,516
just because,
"Ooh, they might be right

191
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,182
and I just want
to double down here

192
00:10:24,223 --> 00:10:26,521
and make sure that
when I get up to the pearly gates,

193
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,550
that St. Peter doesn't say to me,

194
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:30,528
'Sorry, asshole,
you had the wrong religion.

195
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:32,622
Enjoy Hell, buh-bye." '

196
00:10:32,665 --> 00:10:34,633
That's not a good reason,
and you know that.

197
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:36,828
Come on, believe in Jesus.
What do you have to lose?

198
00:10:36,869 --> 00:10:38,860
It's like the lotto.

199
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:41,372
You can't get saved
if you don't play.

200
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:44,103
Yeah, you could be right.
I don't think it's very likely,

201
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,442
but, yes, you could be right,
because my big thing is I don't know.

202
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,674
That's what I preach.

203
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:51,706
I preach the gospel
of I don't know!

204
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:54,185
I mean that's what
I'm here promoting... doubt.

205
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,585
- That's my product.
- Right.

206
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,556
The other guys are
selling certainty, not me.

207
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:00,525
I'm on the corner
with doubt.

208
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:02,117
So, Dr. Collins,

209
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,595
you are a brilliant
brilliant scientist,

210
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:07,190
the head
of the Human Genome Project.

211
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:10,430
Now here's what's
so puzzling is that you are

212
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:12,198
the one scientist...

213
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,967
the one famous scientist anyway...

214
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:16,804
who's also religious.
Explain that to me.

215
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:19,003
I would argue that
if you look at the evidence,

216
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:22,811
the historical evidence
of Christ's existence is overwhelming.

217
00:11:22,848 --> 00:11:24,679
What evidence?

218
00:11:24,717 --> 00:11:28,209
I mean, I've never even heard
anyone propose that there's evidence.

219
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,983
There's been proof
that there's a Jesus.

220
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,320
- That's been proven.
- That hasn't been proven.

221
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,156
How you figure that one?

222
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,661
When I read the New Testament,

223
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:39,563
it reads to me
as the record of eyewitnesses

224
00:11:39,598 --> 00:11:40,929
who put down what they saw.

225
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,025
You know
they weren't eyewitnesses.

226
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,094
- They were close to that.
- No.

227
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:47,867
Within a couple
of decades of eyewitnesses.

228
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,842
- Okay.
- Would that stand up in a laboratory

229
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:54,141
as absolute foolproof evidence

230
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,738
that something happened?

231
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:58,215
You are setting up
a standard for proof

232
00:11:58,250 --> 00:12:01,549
that I think would really be
an almost impossible standard to meet.

233
00:12:01,587 --> 00:12:05,114
No gospel tells us what he was
doing when he was a young man.

234
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,352
You know,
we see Jesus as an infant

235
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,954
and then we kind of pick up
the story when he's 30.

236
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:13,294
I think Jesus was probably
an awkward teenager...

237
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:16,563
big Jewfro,
bad at sports.

238
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:18,968
Here I am!

239
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:21,598
The records we have
are all gospels.

240
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,767
Gospels are not history.

241
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:26,937
Gospel writers never met Jesus,
neither did St. Paul.

242
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:28,970
No one who wrote
about Jesus ever met him.

243
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,982
How can you go back
into the prophets

244
00:12:31,016 --> 00:12:33,143
and the prophets specifically
specifies that certain things...

245
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:34,709
Well, first of all,

246
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:37,279
the New Testament came after
the Old Testament. We agree to that?

247
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:39,553
I agree to that,
but that doesn't mean anything.

248
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:41,787
All it means is the people that
wrote the New Testament

249
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:45,228
read the Old Testament
and then made the prophesies fit.

250
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,822
They can't make it fit
if something didn't happen.

251
00:12:46,866 --> 00:12:48,493
Of course they can.

252
00:12:48,534 --> 00:12:50,729
Then you're saying
the Bible is fictitious?

253
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:52,397
- I am.
- Can't be.

254
00:12:52,438 --> 00:12:53,962
I am.

255
00:12:54,006 --> 00:12:56,167
We do all know that
those texts don't match.

256
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,233
Yeah, sure.
Would you expect them to?

257
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:01,337
I'm surprised that things
that are very important to the story

258
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,974
like the virgin birth
isn't in all four of them.

259
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:07,383
Wouldn't you really expect
that kind of discordance when you're

260
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,183
thinking about the way in which
these documents came into being?

261
00:13:10,222 --> 00:13:13,316
But you'd think if you were
one of Christ's biographers,

262
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,988
that would be sort
of an important thing not to leave out.

263
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:20,157
Oh, God,
he was also born of a virgin.

264
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:22,429
They don't notice the virgin birth.

265
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,427
You know, I think that is something
if you were any sort of reporter

266
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,337
you'd put into the story.

267
00:13:28,374 --> 00:13:32,140
What editor looks at the facts and goes,
"Yeah, but take out the thing

268
00:13:32,178 --> 00:13:35,875
about the virgin birth.
That's not interesting."

269
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,042
I think being without faith

270
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,278
is something that's a luxury

271
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,412
for people who were
fortunate enough

272
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,285
to have a fortunate life.

273
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:45,881
You know, you go to prison

274
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:48,155
and you hear a guy say,
"You know what, buddy?

275
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:49,786
I got nothing but Jesus in here."

276
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,127
I completely understand that.

277
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:55,395
I think not having faith
is a luxury sometimes.

278
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,335
If you're in a foxhole,
you probably have a lot of faith, right?

279
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,133
- Mm-hmm.
- So I get that.

280
00:14:00,172 --> 00:14:02,902
But you guys aren't dumb.
You're smart people.

281
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:04,466
How can smart people...

282
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,978
how can they believe
in the talking snake,

283
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,708
people living to 900 years old
and the virgin birth?

284
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,875
And you know,
that's my question.

285
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,475
You guys have
your own questions.

286
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,043
Pray for me.

287
00:14:15,087 --> 00:14:17,817
Father, in the name of Jesus
and by the power of the Holy Spirit,

288
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:20,052
we ask right now, Lord,
as we lift up Bill to You, Father,

289
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,925
that You can answer his questions
that we can't answer.

290
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:24,930
Father, we thank You
right now for the opportunity

291
00:14:24,964 --> 00:14:27,091
that has come today,

292
00:14:27,132 --> 00:14:29,760
that we may voice
our opinions and hear others.

293
00:14:29,802 --> 00:14:31,463
So we ask You, Lord, to touch

294
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:34,472
and feel wisdom right now
in the name of Jesus.

295
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,565
And we thank You for it
in Jesus's name, amen.

296
00:14:36,609 --> 00:14:39,772
Thank you for being Christlike,
and not just Christian.

297
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:43,213
Okay. Hey, my wallet!

298
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:46,013
No, I'm kidding.

299
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,851
You see so many nice people
trying to make it about

300
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,618
something good

301
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,182
and yet it turns
into not just corrupt,

302
00:14:54,226 --> 00:14:57,423
but, like, fucking-little-kids corrupt

303
00:14:57,463 --> 00:14:59,829
and burning-people-alive cor...

304
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:02,390
I mean, really evil shit.

305
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,232
I'd like to see 10,000 people

306
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:06,761
give $10,000.

307
00:15:06,805 --> 00:15:09,273
Write your biggest check
and send it in.

308
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:12,106
We got people on welfare that's got
enough faith to make a $1,000 vow

309
00:15:12,144 --> 00:15:16,103
- and paying it!
- I want to be in the green, Lord!

310
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,442
What I'm about
to say is revelation.

311
00:15:21,487 --> 00:15:23,614
I got it on DVD.
And I have it on DVD.

312
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,022
And you need to get this. Hallelujah!

313
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,192
Hallelujah!

314
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:37,234
Reverend.
Is that what I call you?

315
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:39,635
No, just call me... doctor.

316
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:41,765
- Doctor?
- Yeah.

317
00:15:41,807 --> 00:15:45,299
All right, Doc. First of all,
I have to tell you, when I heard that

318
00:15:45,344 --> 00:15:47,505
you were in Harold Melvin
and the Blue Notes,

319
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,741
I was like, "That's my man."

320
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,184
And it's funny,
because that lyric

321
00:15:56,221 --> 00:15:58,246
can be interpreted religiously.

322
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:00,258
"If you don't know me
by now." Right?

323
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:02,021
I mean, you must've thought of that.

324
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:04,359
The song did go platinum.

325
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:08,166
Teddy Pendergrass,
who led the song,

326
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,691
he was ordained a minister
when he was 10 years old.

327
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:13,102
What do you think
it says about religion

328
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,072
and how serious it is

329
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:17,268
if you can be a minister
when you're 10?

330
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,040
But there is a comparison
to be made between

331
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,278
musical stars, rock stars

332
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:28,650
and religious figures.
They very often both dress

333
00:16:28,687 --> 00:16:30,951
- in elaborate costumes...
- Mm-hmm.

334
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,821
...that get people's attention.

335
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:48,163
People in a congregation

336
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:50,539
must know that
the outfit was financed

337
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,545
by their donations,
and it doesn't seem to bother them.

338
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,638
I always dress well.

339
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:57,876
I see! Are those gators?

340
00:16:57,916 --> 00:16:59,508
Those are lizards.

341
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,212
- Lizards?
- Yes.

342
00:17:01,253 --> 00:17:04,518
- What do they run?
- They don't run. They crawl.

343
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:08,517
And I see you got a lot of bling.

344
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:12,360
I like gold.
The people want you to look well.

345
00:17:12,398 --> 00:17:14,366
That's what pimps say
about their women.

346
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,733
I was told by one of the greatest pimps
that ever lived...

347
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,069
his name is called God...

348
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,232
that if you know what you got,

349
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:24,242
then you ain't got much.

350
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,176
Jesus dressed very well.

351
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,270
Oh, come on.

352
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:30,611
- Where is the Biblical evidence?
- Wait a minute.

353
00:17:30,649 --> 00:17:32,844
When he was born,
they brought him gold.

354
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:35,353
They brought him gold.
He was not poor.

355
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,821
So my image of Jesus as a man

356
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,881
who championed the poor
and walked around

357
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:43,361
in simple garb, that's wrong?

358
00:17:43,395 --> 00:17:45,522
It was linen.
It was fine linen.

359
00:17:45,564 --> 00:17:47,088
- Really?
- Yeah.

360
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:50,624
But Jesus constantly preaches
against rich people.

361
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:53,069
The Bible does not speak
against being rich.

362
00:17:53,105 --> 00:17:55,801
- Jesus does. Very plainly.
- No no.

363
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:58,969
Jesus was very
very against the rich.

364
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,276
He never preached against being poor.
Blessed are the poor in spirit, for...

365
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,111
No, he preached
against being rich.

366
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:06,777
No no no, he said that
it's better for a rich man...

367
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:10,277
than a rich man to enter...

368
00:18:10,322 --> 00:18:14,088
It is easier for a camel to go
through the eye of a needle

369
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:16,594
than for a rich man
to enter the Kingdom.

370
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:20,257
Okay, but now things
like houses and cars

371
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,790
and clothes and money,

372
00:18:22,835 --> 00:18:25,133
they come as a result

373
00:18:25,170 --> 00:18:27,331
of my seeking God first.

374
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:29,340
I don't remember that

375
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:30,966
in the New Testament specifically.

376
00:18:31,009 --> 00:18:33,034
But it's there. I remember it.

377
00:18:33,078 --> 00:18:34,602
The houses, the cars

378
00:18:34,646 --> 00:18:35,635
and the clothes, they'll come.

379
00:18:35,681 --> 00:18:38,980
Yeah, money comes,
money happens, you know.

380
00:18:39,017 --> 00:18:42,509
Well, money happens for you
because they're giving it up to you.

381
00:18:42,554 --> 00:18:44,818
You're not giving it up to them.

382
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:46,119
Let me set the record straight.

383
00:18:46,158 --> 00:18:48,319
I do not receive
a salary from the church.

384
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,521
I do not take a salary
from the church.

385
00:18:50,562 --> 00:18:52,189
- You take it right out of the pot.
- No no no.

386
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,994
It's such a powerful position.

387
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,262
I mean, you hold people's

388
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:59,862
greatest hopes and dreams
in the palm of your hand, really.

389
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:02,738
Certainly, some of the young women
must get a crush on you.

390
00:19:05,777 --> 00:19:08,803
Probably. I would too
if I was out there.

391
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,577
If I was a woman, I'd probably
have a crush on me, too.

392
00:19:11,617 --> 00:19:13,642
That's keepin' it real.

393
00:19:13,685 --> 00:19:17,382
Now I can advise other young men
about women, because I've been there.

394
00:19:17,422 --> 00:19:20,118
I had a young man who was
about to go crazy over a woman.

395
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,820
He was about
to kill himself, you know?

396
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,988
I said, " That kind of passion,
you should have for God."

397
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:27,931
I said, " Turn that to God
and see what happens."

398
00:19:31,036 --> 00:19:34,995
St. Paul, for example,
whom I know you compare yourself to.

399
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:37,065
People do.

400
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,907
But he famously
only wore on his back

401
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:42,345
the clothes that he owned.

402
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:44,008
- Should I assume that this is...
- He was always on the run.

403
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:47,712
This is your only $2,000 suit?

404
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,812
The gentleman who made
this suit for me

405
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,914
owns a clothing store.

406
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,187
Mr. Kane, you in the house?

407
00:19:54,226 --> 00:19:56,990
The prices that I get
my clothes for...

408
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,827
- you know, I'm blessed in that area.
- Yes, you are.

409
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,596
I'm more blessed than
I've ever been all the days of my life.

410
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:06,866
And the owner is a Muslim,
which... I came out of Islam.

411
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:10,636
I know, I think it's very interesting
that you're a Christian now,

412
00:20:10,676 --> 00:20:13,144
you were a Muslim
and when you get your clothes,

413
00:20:13,178 --> 00:20:16,875
you buy them like a Jew.

414
00:20:16,915 --> 00:20:19,406
And action!

415
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:22,318
That's right... behind me and above me
is the original Twin Cities,

416
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:23,514
Sodom and Gomorrah.

417
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:25,819
Apparently, it was
a pretty wicked place.

418
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:27,552
How wicked?

419
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:30,061
Well let's just say that
what happened in Gomorrah,

420
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:31,722
stayed in Gomorrah.

421
00:20:36,134 --> 00:20:37,624
That is until God got wind of it,

422
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,297
so he sent two angels
to investigate.

423
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:42,307
Now the angels went to the house

424
00:20:42,341 --> 00:20:45,071
of the one godly man in town... Lot.

425
00:20:45,110 --> 00:20:48,807
And the townspeople tried
to rape them.

426
00:20:48,847 --> 00:20:51,008
Now Lot,

427
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,916
not wanting his town
to get the reputation

428
00:20:53,952 --> 00:20:57,581
as the kind of place
that would rape angels,

429
00:20:57,623 --> 00:21:01,252
offered up to the mob
his own daughters to rape.

430
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:03,818
And he was
the good guy in town.

431
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:05,921
Which brings me
to this question:

432
00:21:05,964 --> 00:21:09,229
If I ever had to swear an oath,

433
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,236
why would I want to put my hand

434
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,296
on the King James Bible?

435
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,502
I think I could find more morality
in the Rick James Bible.

436
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,974
God hates fags.

437
00:21:23,015 --> 00:21:26,678
The Constitution does not
grant to homosexuals

438
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,413
the right to perform sodomy.

439
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,614
- I'm a monk.
- A monk.

440
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,317
Franciscan.

441
00:21:32,357 --> 00:21:34,325
What do you think
of homosexuality?

442
00:21:34,359 --> 00:21:36,691
Do you think that's...
the Bible is against it.

443
00:21:36,728 --> 00:21:38,320
No, the Bible is not against it.

444
00:21:38,363 --> 00:21:40,331
The Bible's not
against homosexuality?

445
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:43,391
If you are born homosexual,
you are to stay there.

446
00:21:43,435 --> 00:21:46,029
- You have to be happy.
- But that's what the Bible says?

447
00:21:46,071 --> 00:21:48,699
What the Bible means to say, yeah.

448
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,605
Oh, what the Bible means to say!

449
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:52,701
Now that's a good book.

450
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,837
It preaches the rock-solid truth.

451
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,370
You are faggots!

452
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:59,782
I don't hate them.
God hates them.

453
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,651
- Hey, Bill.
- How are you? Nice to meet you.

454
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,555
Okay. Okay.

455
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,026
So of course, the reason
why we're here is because you're...

456
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,529
I guess we would say, ex-gay.

457
00:22:11,563 --> 00:22:13,497
You used to be gay

458
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:16,330
and then you married someone
who used to be a lesbian.

459
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,428
And you have three children,
and I guess the jury's out on them.

460
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:25,033
Okay, and would you say
it's just like any other marriage

461
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:27,238
of 14 years...
you never have sex?

462
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,543
Oh, funny. Ha ha. Got that.

463
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:33,210
I don't classify myself
as ex-gay, you know?

464
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:35,549
I'm a heterosexual guy
who dealt

465
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:39,148
with some homosexuality.

466
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:42,285
Okay, so the people
who come here are people

467
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,227
who are wanting to do what you did.

468
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:48,221
They want to reform their life
and lead a heterosexual life.

469
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,360
But I will be honest with you.
The reality's a lot of people come here

470
00:22:51,403 --> 00:22:54,338
and go right back
into whatever they came from.

471
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,399
- Because they're gay!
- I believe that it's sin.

472
00:22:57,442 --> 00:23:01,242
Excuse me, but don't you have it,
no pun intended, ass-backwards?

473
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:02,940
Meaning?

474
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:05,677
Meaning homosexuality

475
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:08,185
is something that occurs in nature.

476
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:11,018
I was out bird watching,
but I'd rather watch you.

477
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:12,614
Why don't you come over
and get some?

478
00:23:12,657 --> 00:23:15,922
Man is who wrote
the Bible.

479
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:18,191
Nature made gay people.

480
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,926
Nobody's born gay.
There's no scientific or...

481
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,594
Really? Have you ever met
Little Richard?

482
00:23:23,635 --> 00:23:26,229
We can look at creation and say,
"What's the normal order?"

483
00:23:26,271 --> 00:23:28,432
A man has a penis.
A woman has a vagina.

484
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:30,100
Let's just be blunt.

485
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:32,440
There's no scientific
data that proves

486
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,911
that anyone is...
there's no gay gene.

487
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:36,743
And you also discovered
the gay gene?

488
00:23:36,782 --> 00:23:38,545
Yes.

489
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:40,881
This is all coming from the Bible
which you believe...

490
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,410
- Right.
...to be the word of God.

491
00:23:43,455 --> 00:23:45,685
- I do.
- All of the proscriptions

492
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:49,285
against homosexuality come
from the Old Testament.

493
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:51,761
Jesus never said a word
about homosexuality.

494
00:23:51,797 --> 00:23:53,992
And if it's so important,
why didn't he ever bring it up?

495
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:56,865
We could pick lots of little things

496
00:23:56,902 --> 00:23:58,870
that he didn't
specifically talk about.

497
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:02,670
- But this is a big thing.
- Let me stop this whole thing.

498
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,642
You know, I'm not sure what
your documentary is about,

499
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:09,636
but if it's to basically refute
the word of God,

500
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:12,582
then I'm not interested
in doing your interview, okay?

501
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:15,017
- Well, l...
- I think that

502
00:24:15,053 --> 00:24:17,112
obviously you don't have
the same relationship

503
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:19,123
with Jesus Christ that I do.

504
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:22,957
But what is your explanation
for the millions and millions of people

505
00:24:22,994 --> 00:24:24,586
around the world who are

506
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:26,790
- leading homosexual lives...
- Well, it's not millions.

507
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:30,791
...have no interest in anyone
of the opposite sex?

508
00:24:30,836 --> 00:24:33,361
Are they all faking
just to piss off Jesus?

509
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:35,805
They didn't choose this.
They didn't desire it.

510
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:37,331
Right, they were born gay.

511
00:24:37,375 --> 00:24:39,309
No, they weren't born that way.

512
00:24:39,344 --> 00:24:42,507
It's because of the insecurity
within theirselves.

513
00:24:42,547 --> 00:24:46,108
It takes a lot of security to walk out
of the house with assless chaps.

514
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:49,552
- They're not happy, most of them.
- They're called gay.

515
00:24:49,588 --> 00:24:51,146
They took the word.

516
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,316
Some of them look positively thrilled.

517
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:01,557
No, they are people who
are really not complete

518
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,192
in who they are
as men or women.

519
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:06,170
That's a pretty big judgment
for a Christian.

520
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,172
- It's not a judgment.
- That's not a judgment?

521
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:10,504
That you are sitting here
telling these people

522
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,102
who you don't even know
that they're incomplete

523
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,634
because they're not like you?

524
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,307
I mean, it's not the people you suspect

525
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,907
that are gay, that are gay.

526
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,544
People like
the Reverend Ted Haggard...

527
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:23,884
Moral purity is better than immorality.

528
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:27,380
...who kept meeting
homosexual prostitutes in a hotel room

529
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:30,986
and having gay sex with speed.

530
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,827
Evangelicals have the best
sex life of any other group.

531
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,727
- Good Morning, Duane!
- But he wasn't gay?

532
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:39,669
I already answered that.

533
00:25:39,704 --> 00:25:41,831
I don't believe that
anybody is gay.

534
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:44,637
I don't know,
but honestly, if I just saw you

535
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:48,339
in a bar or something, I would say...
and don't take this the wrong way...

536
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,610
I would say, " Yeah,
I think that guy is gay."

537
00:25:50,649 --> 00:25:53,846
You're good looking.
You're neat, you know.

538
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,547
- You don't look like me.
- Meaning?

539
00:25:56,588 --> 00:25:58,283
Meaning...

540
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:22,946
- All right, thank you.
- Can I give you a hug?

541
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,243
- Yes!
- I hug everybody,

542
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:25,476
so can I give you a hug?

543
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,053
- Thanks.
- Thank you very much.

544
00:26:29,087 --> 00:26:31,055
Hey, you didn't have
a hard-on there, did you?

545
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,024
Nope, sorry. Can't do that.

546
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:38,328
That was good, though.

547
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,730
When I was 17,
my first girlfriend dumped me,

548
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,099
and I was sad in a way
I'd never been sad.

549
00:26:45,136 --> 00:26:47,969
You know,
your first dumping is the worst.

550
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,270
And at that point,
you're very vulnerable

551
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:53,368
to any sort of connection

552
00:26:53,411 --> 00:26:55,242
with, you know...

553
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,840
I didn't get like Jesus-religious,

554
00:26:57,882 --> 00:27:00,316
but I did think a force out there

555
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:03,617
was communicating to me
through song lyrics or...

556
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:07,022
numerology I was
very interested in for a while.

557
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:10,926
You said you were groping
for something at that time.

558
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:13,396
You know, you make up
an imaginary friend who loves you,

559
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,797
is sympathetic to you
and has a plan for you.

560
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:19,201
It's much more important.
He didn't have to love me, God,

561
00:27:19,237 --> 00:27:21,205
He just had
to be working for me.

562
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:22,763
You know, He's like an agent.

563
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:25,503
So you are an ex-Jew for Jesus.

564
00:27:25,543 --> 00:27:27,010
That is correct.

565
00:27:27,045 --> 00:27:30,947
Now what made you to decide
to be a follower of Christ?

566
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,280
What brought Christ
into your life?

567
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:36,549
Back in '75,

568
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:38,613
I went to Michigan
State University.

569
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:42,058
- $2,700?
- Yeah, it's pricey.

570
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,789
Boy, I wonder what Madonna
without the child runs you.

571
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:47,491
So getting back to my story,
I could ask God

572
00:27:47,532 --> 00:27:50,399
to do things in the name
of Jesus and they would happen.

573
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:53,802
So I can't even recall
all the little miracles He did,

574
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:57,239
but He proved to me that
He was real and He was there.

575
00:27:57,275 --> 00:28:00,005
They were so miraculous
and you can't remember what they were?

576
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,672
There were so many of them
and they were little things.

577
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:04,511
- Give me an example.
- One example I can remember was

578
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:05,811
I was at a party.

579
00:28:05,850 --> 00:28:08,512
There was a guy who was working
with Jews for Jesus,

580
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:11,852
and I asked him,
"Can I get a drink of water?"

581
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,757
And he says,
"You know what? Here's a glass,

582
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:16,693
stick your hand out the window
and pray for rain."

583
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:19,553
I didn't like the attitude.

584
00:28:19,597 --> 00:28:21,121
I said okay,

585
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:24,294
and I stuck my hand out the window
and it started pouring rain.

586
00:28:24,335 --> 00:28:28,066
Pouring so bad that people
couldn't leave the party.

587
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,336
To me, that's a miracle.
You don't have to believe it,

588
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,503
- but I know between me and God...
- It is pretty lame.

589
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:36,309
- But you asked.
- I asked, but I'm just saying

590
00:28:36,347 --> 00:28:39,282
- that's my reaction to your answer.
- But that's just one of many things.

591
00:28:39,317 --> 00:28:41,376
I live a life of miracles.

592
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:45,287
No, you live your life with the same
sort of mundane coincidences

593
00:28:45,323 --> 00:28:47,154
that happen to everybody
in the world.

594
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:50,992
It's not like,
you know, if it rained frogs,

595
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:52,656
I would say you had a point.

596
00:28:52,697 --> 00:28:54,665
But it rains, and it stops raining.

597
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,860
Well, when was the last time
you asked for rain

598
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:58,493
and it starting raining
within 10 seconds?

599
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:00,333
I don't know.
I don't ever ask for rain.

600
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:02,635
But if I asked for it really bad
and it started to rain,

601
00:29:02,674 --> 00:29:04,164
I wouldn't think it was
because I asked for it.

602
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:06,609
I would think
because it sometimes rains.

603
00:29:06,644 --> 00:29:09,135
God is not that busy

604
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:11,239
where He can't spend time
listening to you

605
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:13,113
when you really want
to talk to Him, anytime.

606
00:29:13,151 --> 00:29:15,711
If Santa Claus can hit
every house in the world

607
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:17,881
- in one night...
- I don't believe in Santa Claus.

608
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,857
Of course not, that's ridiculous.
That's one man flying

609
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:23,452
all around the world and dropping
presents down a chimney.

610
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:26,259
That's ridiculous.
One man hearing everybody murmur

611
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,663
to him at the same time, that I get.

612
00:29:30,401 --> 00:29:32,767
And you know what else
was very confusing to me?

613
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,795
I remember vividly

614
00:29:34,839 --> 00:29:37,740
was Santa Claus

615
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,643
- and Jesus.
- You were so mad at us.

616
00:29:40,678 --> 00:29:43,670
- Oh, yes.
- So mad at you, why? Oh, when...

617
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,775
When you realized there
was no Santa Claus.

618
00:29:46,818 --> 00:29:49,548
And then when I found out
there was no Jesus,

619
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:52,078
boy, was I pissed.

620
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,683
You spoke before in certitude.

621
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,751
You're 100% sure
that after you die,

622
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,025
you'll go to a better place.

623
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,930
I know I'll be with God.
I'll be with Jesus.

624
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,695
And that's a better place.

625
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,329
Even if it was in a garbage can,

626
00:30:06,371 --> 00:30:08,339
which I know it won't be,
but even if it was,

627
00:30:08,373 --> 00:30:11,137
just the fact that
I'm with Jesus, to me, is good.

628
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:13,269
- It's a better place.
- It's a better place.

629
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,769
Then why don't you kill yourself?

630
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,578
Because God still has
a mission for me here.

631
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:19,810
Oh, I see.

632
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:23,378
I'm thinking of Jonah.
God sent Jonah on a mission.

633
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:26,288
When did the part of the story come
when Jonah lived in the whale?

634
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,315
It was a great fish.

635
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,327
It's one of my favorite
nonsense stories,

636
00:30:30,361 --> 00:30:32,522
Jonah living inside
of the whale.

637
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:36,364
And their answer unfailingly is

638
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:39,700
"The Bible doesn't say whale.
It says big fish."

639
00:30:39,737 --> 00:30:41,728
Oh, yeah, big fish,
that makes...

640
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:45,174
I'm sorry I was obsessing
on that it was a whale. It's a big fish.

641
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,905
Of course you could live
for three days in a big fish.

642
00:30:46,945 --> 00:30:48,810
A tuna.

643
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:51,941
They do it all the time in Japan.
They have tuna spas.

644
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:55,214
You go for three days.
They pamper you, oils.

645
00:30:55,253 --> 00:30:58,586
You come out of that tuna
feeling fantastic.

646
00:30:58,623 --> 00:31:00,181
You smell like pussy,

647
00:31:00,225 --> 00:31:03,490
but you feel fantastic.

648
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:06,361
This man lived inside
of a fish for three days?

649
00:31:06,397 --> 00:31:09,298
Miraculously, yes.

650
00:31:09,334 --> 00:31:11,859
Steve, Steve, Steve.

651
00:31:11,903 --> 00:31:13,632
You don't believe in miracles.

652
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:16,333
- That doesn't mean they don't exist.
- Of course not!

653
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:17,932
I'm not 10!

654
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,910
He lived in a fish.

655
00:31:19,944 --> 00:31:22,606
Come on.

656
00:31:22,647 --> 00:31:25,878
Your bar on miracles is pretty low,
I gotta tell you, bro.

657
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,942
Well, whatever.

658
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,477
Two things that are
completely incompatible

659
00:31:30,521 --> 00:31:33,752
are Christianity
as Jesus taught it

660
00:31:33,791 --> 00:31:35,725
- and nationalism...
- Right. Exactly.

661
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:39,025
...and yet people always
say God and country.

662
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,691
Jesus would never...
you know,

663
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,564
people who are
such good Christians...

664
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:46,365
in one breath you'll hear them
say something like,

665
00:31:46,404 --> 00:31:48,304
"Well, you gotta take care
of your own first.

666
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:51,069
I know people overseas have trouble,
but you gotta take"...

667
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:54,977
that is not a message I can ever see
the Jesus in the Bible,

668
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:57,982
even when he was
in a bad mood, would say.

669
00:32:02,153 --> 00:32:03,279
I'm gonna vote Bible.

670
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:04,879
It's time for God's people to come

671
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:08,086
out of the closets,
out of the churches

672
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,957
and change America!

673
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:11,586
Unless you and I do
what God wants us to do,

674
00:32:11,629 --> 00:32:13,790
he'll go to some other country.

675
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:16,163
God, forgive America!

676
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,136
I would probably have to say yes,
that the Constitution established

677
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,935
the United States of America
as a Christian nation.

678
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:25,568
We have, of course,
"In God We Trust" on our money.

679
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,770
The Senate will come to order.

680
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:28,005
The chaplain will lead
the Senate in prayer.

681
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:36,950
How did this country
get to be a Christian nation?

682
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:39,456
I've read a lot of quotes
from all the Founding Fathers.

683
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,219
There are a lot of quotes
that explicitly say

684
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,454
we're not a Christian nation.

685
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:57,705
And Jefferson's
a particularly interesting case.

686
00:32:57,742 --> 00:33:01,405
Didn't he write his own Bible
which divorced the New Testament

687
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:04,677
from what he considered
the unnecessary magic,

688
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:06,445
bells and whistles?

689
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,543
He took the Gospels,

690
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:10,611
took out all of Jesus's miracles

691
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,452
and took out
all of Jesus's statements

692
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:14,720
that claimed divinity,

693
00:33:14,759 --> 00:33:17,057
and put out a new book called
"The Faith and Moral Teachings

694
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,528
of Jesus of Nazareth."

695
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:21,657
We tend to lionize these guys
and think of them all

696
00:33:21,699 --> 00:33:24,930
as the 12 Apostles
plus the Founding Fathers,

697
00:33:24,969 --> 00:33:27,233
like they're in the same
club or something.

698
00:33:27,271 --> 00:33:29,899
When in fact,
these men understood very well

699
00:33:29,941 --> 00:33:32,171
that there was a difference
between being Christian

700
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,075
and being American.

701
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,342
- Right.
- In Jefferson's age, fewer people went

702
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:39,214
to church less often.

703
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,582
Do you think that there
are a lot of people

704
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:44,588
who feel the way you do,
but are afraid to speak out?

705
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,385
Absolutely. Are you kidding?

706
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:49,825
Yes, I think it is
the great untapped minority

707
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,556
in this country.

708
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,120
In the last survey,

709
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:56,691
I think it was 16% of Americans

710
00:33:56,734 --> 00:33:59,760
who now say they are
absolutely unaffiliated

711
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:02,398
with any religion,
don't want to be in a religion,

712
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,203
just don't go near me
with religion.

713
00:34:04,242 --> 00:34:07,177
16% of the population is

714
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,203
a huge minority.
It's bigger than Jews,

715
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:14,150
blacks, homosexuals,
NRA members,

716
00:34:14,185 --> 00:34:16,676
lots of people you could name
who have lobbies

717
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,246
that get everything they want

718
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:23,192
or are at least are in the debate.

719
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:25,354
You want me to kinda angle
like this or straight ahead?

720
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:27,591
Just as natural as possible to Bill.

721
00:34:27,632 --> 00:34:30,863
So you've described yourself
as an Evangelical Christian.

722
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,360
You did a campaign ad where you said
the most important lessons in life

723
00:34:34,405 --> 00:34:37,306
are in this book right here,
meaning the Bible.

724
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:41,072
Everyone in politics likes
to brag that they're a person of faith.

725
00:34:41,112 --> 00:34:43,740
Why is faith good?

726
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:45,772
Faith has a way

727
00:34:45,817 --> 00:34:48,115
of softening people.

728
00:34:48,152 --> 00:34:51,417
For example, if you look at the
teachings of Jesus, he's very forgiving.

729
00:34:51,456 --> 00:34:53,515
He also said,
"If a man doesn't abide in me,

730
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,425
he is cast forth
as a branch and withers,

731
00:34:56,461 --> 00:35:00,022
and the branches are gathered,
thrown into the fire and burned."

732
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:03,431
Right. So?

733
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,299
I do think, 'cause I'm a Christian,

734
00:35:05,336 --> 00:35:08,100
that Jesus is the way
to be reconciled.

735
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:12,769
And I do believe
the actual literacy of that story.

736
00:35:12,810 --> 00:35:17,270
We'll let God sort out all the details
of that on Judgment Day.

737
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:19,044
What about
the 10 Commandments?

738
00:35:19,083 --> 00:35:22,416
So many politicians talk
about the 10 Commandments.

739
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:24,648
Are they really the 10 most

740
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:27,089
- important moral...
- Are these the 10 suggestions?

741
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,616
The 10 recommendations?

742
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:32,026
But it's not really a wide list of 10.

743
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,031
The first four are all

744
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:37,364
about just worshipping God
and basically that he's a jealous God,

745
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,528
and he doesn't want you
to have any other gods.

746
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,663
The only two that are really laws

747
00:35:41,706 --> 00:35:43,697
are don't steal and don't kill.

748
00:35:43,741 --> 00:35:45,971
Why is this the wisest group of 10?

749
00:35:46,010 --> 00:35:49,707
It doesn't include child abuse.
It doesn't include don't torture.

750
00:35:49,747 --> 00:35:51,840
It doesn't include
a lot of things... rape...

751
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:54,681
that I think if we were
making a list today,

752
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,380
we would probably include.

753
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:58,820
Society is so different today

754
00:35:58,856 --> 00:36:01,347
and our culture is
so radically different today.

755
00:36:01,392 --> 00:36:03,952
That's what I'm asking.
We're in a different culture.

756
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:07,624
Can you think of anything else that
we still cleave to from the Bronze Age?

757
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,496
Well...

758
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:31,249
Basically, murder is against the law
in every country in the world.

759
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:34,281
But wouldn't we have come
to that even without religion?

760
00:36:34,325 --> 00:36:37,021
Don't you think people would
have gotten together and said,

761
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:39,154
"You know what?
Let's not slaughter each other

762
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,894
- and not take each other's stuff."
- I don't know.

763
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,732
There's been more killing
in the name of "My God."

764
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,206
You think maybe sort of indigously

765
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,435
or just by our DNA,

766
00:36:51,475 --> 00:36:54,273
we somehow know that killing
another person is wrong?

767
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,940
I'm not sure that that's the case.

768
00:36:56,981 --> 00:36:59,677
Really, you need God
to decide not to kill each other?

769
00:36:59,717 --> 00:37:03,118
Well, you can look back
at more primitive cultures,

770
00:37:03,154 --> 00:37:06,783
and they were constantly at war.

771
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:14,420
We are now, among industrialized,
modern nations,

772
00:37:14,465 --> 00:37:16,695
the most religious nation.

773
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,793
A recent study found that

774
00:37:18,836 --> 00:37:20,895
among 32 countries,

775
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,532
more people in this country
doubted evolution

776
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:27,305
than any other country on that list,
except, I think, it was Turkey.

777
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:29,711
In the US,
we have freedom of religion.

778
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:32,045
I think most of the countries on
that list do have freedom of religion.

779
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,983
Well, that's interesting.

780
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,280
Do you believe in evolution?

781
00:37:35,319 --> 00:37:38,220
You know my... I don't know.

782
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:40,986
Clearly the scientific community's
a little divided

783
00:37:41,025 --> 00:37:44,392
on some of the specifics
of that and I understand that.

784
00:37:44,428 --> 00:37:47,261
- I don't think they are.
- No no... well...

785
00:37:47,298 --> 00:37:49,323
I think they pretty much agree.

786
00:37:49,367 --> 00:37:51,198
I don't know how it all happened.

787
00:37:51,235 --> 00:37:54,261
I'm certainly willing to accept
the scientific premise.

788
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:56,967
It couldn't possibly
have been Adam and Eve

789
00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:00,136
5,000 years ago with a talking snake
and a garden, could it?

790
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:01,838
Well, it could've
possibly been that.

791
00:38:01,879 --> 00:38:04,439
Come on.
See, this is my problem.

792
00:38:04,482 --> 00:38:06,814
I mean, you're a senator.

793
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,149
You are one
of the very few people

794
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:10,949
who are really
running this country.

795
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:14,947
It worries me that people are
running my country who think...

796
00:38:14,992 --> 00:38:16,619
who believe
in a talking snake.

797
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:19,357
You don't have to pass an IQ test
to be in the Senate, though.

798
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,838
As you first come
into the Creation Museum,

799
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:33,343
there's going to be a sense

800
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,106
of "This is something really big."

801
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,240
This is something awe-inspiring,
something great here.

802
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,750
We can answer the questions
of the skeptics

803
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:42,514
that attack
the Bible's history.

804
00:38:42,553 --> 00:38:45,215
We admit that we start
from the Bible here

805
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:46,780
to teach them how to think.

806
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:48,985
Really, in a nutshell,
we're saying, the Bible's true

807
00:38:49,026 --> 00:38:50,721
from Genesis to Revelation.

808
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,099
We're building the whole place
for about $27 million.

809
00:39:01,105 --> 00:39:02,663
I have many people say to me,

810
00:39:02,707 --> 00:39:04,607
"As a Christian,
can't you believe in evolution?"

811
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:07,202
I say, " Well, you got a problem.
God made a man and a woman."

812
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:10,008
If you believe in evolution, the woman
had to come from an ape woman.

813
00:39:10,047 --> 00:39:14,040
All right,
but you're so damned ugly.

814
00:39:15,419 --> 00:39:19,185
This is what we call the main hall
here. Immediately, people see

815
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:21,020
dinosaurs and people together,
which is very different

816
00:39:21,058 --> 00:39:24,687
to the idea of the evolutionists
who say dinosaurs died out

817
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:27,994
70 million ago or so,
and so they didn't live with humans.

818
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:31,024
They see an animatronic
dinosaur over here.

819
00:39:31,068 --> 00:39:33,696
Two animatronic baby T-Rexes
and two animatronic children.

820
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:37,174
It's basically just to give people
a wow factor as they come in here.

821
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:45,213
How to share your faith
effectively and Biblically,

822
00:39:45,249 --> 00:39:46,807
to be able to reason
with people,

823
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,580
learn to circumnavigate

824
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:50,610
or go around
the person's intellect.

825
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:54,215
There's plenty of people who
would say, "Well, it's just my faith."

826
00:39:54,258 --> 00:39:56,954
But that's not good enough
for you. You say, " No.

827
00:39:56,994 --> 00:39:59,462
We can basically
reconcile the science

828
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:02,193
with what's in Genesis."

829
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:05,100
We're an organization that...
to put it in a nutshell...

830
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,764
is telling people that
the Bible's history is true,

831
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,102
its history beginning
in Genesis.

832
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:12,541
Scientists line up
overwhelmingly

833
00:40:12,576 --> 00:40:14,771
on one side of this issue.
It would have to be

834
00:40:14,812 --> 00:40:18,578
an enormous conspiracy
going on between scientists

835
00:40:18,616 --> 00:40:21,244
of all different disciplines
in all different countries

836
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,913
to have such a consensus.

837
00:40:23,954 --> 00:40:25,478
That doesn't move you?

838
00:40:25,523 --> 00:40:28,014
No, not at all, because from
a Biblical perspective,

839
00:40:28,058 --> 00:40:31,289
I understand why the majority
would not agree with the truth.

840
00:40:31,328 --> 00:40:34,422
Man is a sinner.
Man is rebelling against his creator.

841
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:37,332
All these scientists
are sinners?

842
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,427
Well...

843
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,598
We have been talking
to so many religious people

844
00:40:42,640 --> 00:40:45,074
and many of them believe
the earth is 5,000 years old.

845
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:47,577
If you're a scientist,
you can't accept that.

846
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:50,944
Now you recently were the director
of the Vatican Observatory.

847
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,142
A Vatican astronomer.

848
00:40:53,184 --> 00:40:56,119
It's one of those terms
like "gay Republican"...

849
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:58,121
you know,
you just don't expect it.

850
00:40:58,155 --> 00:41:01,647
- I'm not getting into that.
- No no no, I'm not asking you to.

851
00:41:01,692 --> 00:41:03,683
It's not that the church
has the idea, you know,

852
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:06,992
they're gonna train us up
so we can be the first ones out there

853
00:41:07,031 --> 00:41:09,158
to baptize those extraterrestrials

854
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,293
before the Mormons get at 'em.

855
00:41:11,335 --> 00:41:13,929
The reason is simply

856
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,599
historical facts.

857
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,837
John Paul II,
for instance, said evolution

858
00:41:19,877 --> 00:41:23,836
in the neo-Darwinian sense is
no longer a mere hypothesis.

859
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:26,179
I mean, he said that.
It's in writing.

860
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,708
I still don't understand
why it's important

861
00:41:28,752 --> 00:41:31,312
for there to have to have been
a situation on earth

862
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:34,017
where a man co-existed
with dinosaurs.

863
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,616
Only really
in "The Flintstones"...

864
00:41:35,659 --> 00:41:37,627
Is someone talking about me?

865
00:41:37,661 --> 00:41:39,185
...and that Raquel Welch movie

866
00:41:39,230 --> 00:41:42,722
does man ever co-exist
with dinosaurs.

867
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:46,668
Why is that important
for your salvation or your morality?

868
00:41:46,704 --> 00:41:48,433
If you're saying
this part over here,

869
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:51,236
it says God made land animals
and man on the same day is not true,

870
00:41:51,275 --> 00:41:54,369
then ultimately, why should
I believe this bit over here?

871
00:41:54,411 --> 00:41:58,142
The Christian Scriptures
were written

872
00:41:58,182 --> 00:42:00,980
between about 2,000 years
before Christ

873
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:03,077
to about 200 years after Christ.

874
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,314
That's it.

875
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:07,813
Modern science came
to be with Galileo

876
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,224
up through Newton,
up through Einstein.

877
00:42:10,261 --> 00:42:13,424
What we know
as modern science, okay,

878
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:14,931
is in that period.

879
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:18,298
How in the world could
there be any science

880
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:20,064
in scripture?

881
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,696
There cannot be.

882
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:24,367
Just the two historical
periods are separated

883
00:42:24,408 --> 00:42:26,103
by so much.

884
00:42:26,143 --> 00:42:28,077
The Scriptures are not

885
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,273
teaching science.

886
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:32,282
It's very hard for me to accept,

887
00:42:32,316 --> 00:42:35,843
not just a literal interpretation
of scripture,

888
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:38,684
but a fundamentalist approach
to religious belief.

889
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,587
It's kind of a plague.

890
00:42:40,624 --> 00:42:43,354
It presents itself
as science and it's not.

891
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,692
God is an infinite God
who is working in ways

892
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:48,357
- we don't always understand.
- You don't think that's a cop-out?

893
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,061
He is God.

894
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,625
Are you God?

895
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,933
No.

896
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:01,273
We went to church every Sunday.

897
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:04,941
My sister and I went to Catechism,
which is Catholic, you know,

898
00:43:04,982 --> 00:43:08,383
like Hebrew school for papists.

899
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,886
It was like war.

900
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:13,048
It was vast stretches
of boredom punctuated

901
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:15,786
by moments of sheer terror.

902
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,423
I'm in the Vatican.

903
00:43:29,206 --> 00:43:31,037
Buongiorno!

904
00:43:31,075 --> 00:43:33,976
I know what you're thinking.
I'm standing in front of a green screen

905
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,911
at a studio
in Burbank, California,

906
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,437
and they digitalized
the Vatican in behind me.

907
00:43:38,482 --> 00:43:41,144
No no, that's really the Vatican.

908
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,153
I ought to know.
I just got thrown out of it.

909
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,052
See, I wanted
to interview the Pope,

910
00:43:45,089 --> 00:43:48,991
but I was willing to settle
for a cardinal or a monsignor

911
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:51,153
or the Flying Nun...
really anybody...

912
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:54,653
but apparently I've been on the
Catholic shit list for quite a while.

913
00:43:54,698 --> 00:43:57,690
But that's their loss, 'cause now
I'm gonna say what I really think,

914
00:43:57,735 --> 00:43:59,794
which is mainly:

915
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:01,429
Does that look anything

916
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:04,270
like anything Jesus Christ
had in mind?

917
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:07,641
When you look at a building
like that, a giant palace,

918
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:09,873
does it seem at odds
with the message of the founder?

919
00:44:09,913 --> 00:44:11,437
Well, certainly.

920
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,883
- Well, thank you.
- I mean, that's obvious.

921
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:18,445
It really is obvious, isn't it?
But does it bother you?

922
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:21,856
Well, I mean...
well, yes it does.

923
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:24,452
I wouldn't...
if I were the boss,

924
00:44:24,495 --> 00:44:26,395
I wouldn't be living there.

925
00:44:26,430 --> 00:44:29,422
I mean Jesus would be
probably out in some barracks here

926
00:44:29,466 --> 00:44:32,663
in a suburb of Rome, got it?

927
00:44:32,703 --> 00:44:35,536
Do you ever get so fed up
you want to take the collar and go...

928
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:37,563
- Well, I don't wear a collar anyway.
..." That's it, Captain.

929
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,633
Take my badge and my collar."

930
00:44:39,677 --> 00:44:42,874
I read about 10 books recently...
the rationality of religion,

931
00:44:42,913 --> 00:44:45,473
and everyone's saying it's stupid.

932
00:44:46,750 --> 00:44:48,718
You know what's
gonna happen to them.

933
00:44:48,752 --> 00:44:50,413
- No, what's gonna happen?
- They're gonna be roasting in hell.

934
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:53,082
Come on, roasting.
That's the old Catholic thing.

935
00:44:53,123 --> 00:44:54,590
That's what they taught me.

936
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,388
Yeah, I know, that hell business.

937
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:59,225
Well, come on, the standard doctrine
that I was taught as a kid...

938
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,424
Yeah, that's all gone.
That's all finished.

939
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:02,932
But that's not fair.

940
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:06,265
- Yeah, pfft!
- The date of Jesus's birth

941
00:45:06,303 --> 00:45:08,771
really wasn't established
until 349 A.D.

942
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:11,001
Oh, yeah...

943
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,703
because he might've
been born on July 3rd.

944
00:45:13,744 --> 00:45:17,271
These are all
nice stories, you know.

945
00:45:17,314 --> 00:45:19,646
- And that doesn't bother you, either?
- That bothers me too.

946
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:22,015
I mean, when everybody's,
"Ooh, we have to have midnight mass

947
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:24,850
because Jesus was born
on midnight on 25th of"...

948
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,788
this is all nonsense.

949
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,917
- You're a maverick, aren't you?
- I'm not a maverick.

950
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:32,554
You're Father Maverick.
You do things your own way.

951
00:45:37,968 --> 00:45:40,960
When you add up
all the saints and all the angels

952
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:43,598
and archangels
and super-duper angels...

953
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:46,632
there's God, the Father,
God the Son, the Holy Ghost,

954
00:45:46,677 --> 00:45:49,407
Mother Mary...
it does start to look like

955
00:45:49,446 --> 00:45:52,176
it's not quite
the monotheistic religion that it's...

956
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,616
Oh, I understand.
Like we have mini-gods.

957
00:45:54,651 --> 00:45:58,087
Yeah, well, it does seem like that,
if people pray to a...

958
00:45:58,122 --> 00:46:00,249
Well, yeah, but some people
just don't understand this.

959
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,815
You probably are...
you don't follow things...

960
00:46:02,860 --> 00:46:05,454
but they had a survey here
in Italy, you know,

961
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,464
and they said, " In a crisis,

962
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:10,126
what kind of saints
do you pray to?" Got it?

963
00:46:10,167 --> 00:46:13,261
You know who's the sixth
on the list? Jesus Christ.

964
00:46:13,303 --> 00:46:14,998
The sixth?

965
00:46:15,038 --> 00:46:18,530
He's the sixth man
that the Italians call upon

966
00:46:18,575 --> 00:46:21,009
when they have problems.
Isn't that neat?

967
00:46:21,044 --> 00:46:25,413
- That's very interesting.
- Talk about Cafeteria Catholics. Pfft!

968
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:27,440
So how do you convince people
of what's the true faith?

969
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:30,419
You don't, forget it.
You just have to live and die

970
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:33,355
with their stupid ideas.

971
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:35,620
I'm sorry.
What are you gonna do?

972
00:46:35,659 --> 00:46:37,627
You can go to a pitch meeting
at a movie studio and go,

973
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:40,061
"Okay, there's a spaceman

974
00:46:40,097 --> 00:46:41,792
who zaps a virgin

975
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:44,699
and he gives birth
to a son who's also him,

976
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,635
who then goes
on a suicide mission."

977
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,103
I wonder what people
would say about that.

978
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,299
Yeah, that is actually
a great pitch.

979
00:46:50,340 --> 00:46:52,604
It has so many elements
that they like,

980
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,611
because they love
suicide missions.

981
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,443
They love violence,
and Hollywood loves something

982
00:46:57,481 --> 00:47:00,314
it's never seen before... a virgin.

983
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,667
Hey, Shalom.

984
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:27,701
We're so glad to have you here.
Just come and get blessed.

985
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:35,848
These are here to teach God's word.

986
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,683
We're in a spiritual warfare.

987
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:39,712
We don't push our beliefs on people,

988
00:47:39,756 --> 00:47:41,815
but we do make them available.

989
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:44,726
- Have you ever had a Muslim person?
- Yes, definitely.

990
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,592
People from Gaza Strip come.

991
00:47:49,766 --> 00:47:51,893
We get many people
who come here say,

992
00:47:51,935 --> 00:47:54,165
"We've come every year
to Florida

993
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,435
and we've done the tourist
things and all and we enjoy those.

994
00:47:57,474 --> 00:48:00,705
We wish we had
seen this first,"

995
00:48:00,744 --> 00:48:04,009
because their experience
here was so meaningful.

996
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,039
Do you think if...
when you were a kid...

997
00:48:07,084 --> 00:48:10,349
they transposed the Bible stories

998
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,878
with the fairy tales, you'd know
the difference as an adult?

999
00:48:14,157 --> 00:48:16,819
- My name is Eve.
- I'm Adam.

1000
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:18,794
This place is amazing.

1001
00:48:18,829 --> 00:48:21,593
If they told you Jack
and the Beanstalk was religion

1002
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:24,726
and that a man who lived
in a whale was in a fairy-tale book...

1003
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:28,262
you think when you got
to be an adult,

1004
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:30,296
you'd be defending
the one instead of the other?

1005
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,433
So you're saying that
the Bible's a fairy tale?

1006
00:48:32,476 --> 00:48:35,377
God took my rib like this

1007
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,346
and began to whittle it

1008
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:39,246
like this

1009
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:42,719
and blow on it...
and then...

1010
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,517
Saved means believing
in Jesus Christ

1011
00:48:45,555 --> 00:48:47,318
- as the only begotten Son of God.
- Not for me, it don't.

1012
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,257
What about the Muslims?

1013
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,591
Many Muslims are
saved right now.

1014
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:53,061
I don't get it.

1015
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,496
I pray in your lifetime you do.

1016
00:48:55,532 --> 00:48:59,161
Jesus came through a Jew.
He was not the seed of man.

1017
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:01,170
He came through
a Jewish woman,

1018
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:02,796
but no man had
ever touched her.

1019
00:49:02,839 --> 00:49:04,864
No flesh had ever
touched her.

1020
00:49:04,908 --> 00:49:07,206
He was the seed of God.

1021
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,721
You want me to lean up against
the tomb or something

1022
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,790
or you want casual or... okay.

1023
00:49:30,834 --> 00:49:32,426
Did I give you my cell phone?

1024
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:34,767
Oh, I left my cell phone, right?
Just want to make sure.

1025
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:36,705
Testing one two,
check, testing.

1026
00:49:36,740 --> 00:49:39,607
How you doing, Bill?
God bless you.

1027
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:40,871
- Hi.
- Seen you around.

1028
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:43,311
- Welcome to our world.
- I've seen you around.

1029
00:49:43,347 --> 00:49:46,544
Now is this your tomb?
Is this a real rock?

1030
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:49,211
No, it's just cement.
They just kind of cemented it in there.

1031
00:49:49,252 --> 00:49:51,982
So when you go out to dinner,
people recognize you?

1032
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:53,319
All the time, yeah.

1033
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:55,917
I think you get
a little bit of that, too.

1034
00:49:55,959 --> 00:49:59,486
But they don't think I'm the Lord.
You must really be...

1035
00:49:59,529 --> 00:50:02,498
Why do you think people come here?
'Cause Disneyland's too smutty?

1036
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:04,261
I personally haven't been
to the Holy Land,

1037
00:50:04,301 --> 00:50:06,235
so this was an awesome experience
for me when I walked on the property.

1038
00:50:06,269 --> 00:50:09,636
- I was like, "Wow, this is cool."
- Let me ask you questions

1039
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,072
- about your business...
- Yes.

1040
00:50:11,108 --> 00:50:14,544
...or really the Jesus business.
God is super powerful.

1041
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,239
- He can do anything.
- Sure.

1042
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:19,442
Why doesn't
he just obliterate the devil

1043
00:50:19,483 --> 00:50:22,748
and therefore get rid
of evil in the world?

1044
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:25,516
- He will.
- He will? What's he waiting for?

1045
00:50:25,555 --> 00:50:27,523
- End times.
- But why play it out like that?

1046
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:29,991
- Why make it a game?
- Well, it's not necessarily a game.

1047
00:50:30,027 --> 00:50:33,155
A day is like a thousand years
in God's eyes, it says in the Bible.

1048
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:35,562
If you wanna look at it...
just like two days ago, Christ died.

1049
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:39,126
But I know that he is
so far beyond any of our ways,

1050
00:50:39,169 --> 00:50:41,660
that he can work
the worst situation for his good.

1051
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:43,696
What was the Holocaust?
Why was that good?

1052
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:46,208
You know, God had a plan for that.
Maybe it's to cause...

1053
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:48,040
I wonder if you would have thought
that if you were one of the people

1054
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,171
- being pushed into an oven.
- Well, you know what?

1055
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,545
It's like trying to explain
to an ant how a TV works.

1056
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:55,107
That's... God's ways are
so much higher than ours.

1057
00:50:55,152 --> 00:50:57,882
There's no way
you can understand that.

1058
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:59,718
We need to stop the interview
for just a moment, please.

1059
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:01,587
- Nice to see you.
- Senior manager of public relations.

1060
00:51:01,625 --> 00:51:04,788
- Hi, Les, I'll be right with you.
- Hi. Sure.

1061
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,233
I'm not afraid
of the piranha women.

1062
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:17,900
When he came, he said, " I come not
to abolish the law, but to fulfill it."

1063
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:20,466
You boil all those
Levitical laws down to two things:

1064
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,034
No other God is before me, Bill,

1065
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,944
and love the Lord with all your heart.

1066
00:51:23,980 --> 00:51:25,743
But, Jesus, having
no other gods before you,

1067
00:51:25,782 --> 00:51:28,478
that's not moral.
There's nothing moral about that.

1068
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:31,180
It's just something
a jealous god would do.

1069
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,212
It does say that our God
is a jealous god.

1070
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:36,953
But your God is jealous?
That seems so unGodlike

1071
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:39,257
that God would have such
a petty human emotion.

1072
00:51:39,296 --> 00:51:41,764
I know people who have
gotten over jealousy,

1073
00:51:41,798 --> 00:51:43,857
- let alone God.
- There's two sides to the coin.

1074
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:46,630
He's a just God
and he's also a merciful God.

1075
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:50,629
No, he spends the first five books
of the Bible wiping out people.

1076
00:51:50,674 --> 00:51:53,905
That's what he chose to do.
His ways are higher than ours, Bill.

1077
00:51:53,944 --> 00:51:56,572
- Maybe our thinking should be higher.
- That's a good point.

1078
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,582
God has got
this God-sized hole in your life.

1079
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,447
You can fit that
with any position...

1080
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:04,079
drugs, sex, whatever you want...
it is not gonna fill it.

1081
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:05,645
- Can I try?
- You can try all you want.

1082
00:52:05,689 --> 00:52:06,815
You're gonna end up
hurting yourself,

1083
00:52:06,857 --> 00:52:08,620
damaging yourself
and burning yourself up.

1084
00:52:08,658 --> 00:52:10,853
I thought Christ was
about not judging people.

1085
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,124
- That's true.
- Isn't that a judgment there?

1086
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:15,688
You don't know me and you're telling me
I need to fill a hole in my heart

1087
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,757
- with drugs and sex.
- No, I'm not talking about you.

1088
00:52:17,801 --> 00:52:19,325
I'm saying anyone in general.

1089
00:52:19,369 --> 00:52:22,634
See, if I was God, I would create people
without the hole to begin with.

1090
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:26,369
Have you ever had a little voice in
the back of your mind say something?

1091
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:28,206
- We've all had that.
- That's called the Holy Spirit.

1092
00:52:28,245 --> 00:52:30,679
- That's not God. That's you.
- That's called the Holy Spirit.

1093
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:32,011
- Feel this wind right now?
- Yeah.

1094
00:52:32,048 --> 00:52:34,016
Okay, where is it?
You don't know, right?

1095
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,678
- Yeah, it's called wind.
- Okay, that's like the Holy Spirit.

1096
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:39,712
It's a monotheistic religion,
but there's three of them.

1097
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:42,190
Just like water can be ice,
steam and water.

1098
00:52:42,225 --> 00:52:44,022
I see.

1099
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:46,221
It's different forms, different shapes
for the different purposes.

1100
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:48,424
The analogy that Jesus
at the amusement park

1101
00:52:48,465 --> 00:52:50,330
said yesterday was brilliant,

1102
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:53,029
about the Trinity is like water.

1103
00:52:53,069 --> 00:52:55,264
It can be steam. It can be ice.

1104
00:52:55,305 --> 00:52:58,138
It can be liquid.
Wow, that is...

1105
00:52:58,175 --> 00:53:01,110
boy, that stopped me
in my tracks for a second, you know?

1106
00:53:01,144 --> 00:53:03,044
That's just a brilliant analogy.

1107
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:04,546
When you think about it
for two minutes,

1108
00:53:04,581 --> 00:53:07,072
it's still complete bullshit.

1109
00:53:07,117 --> 00:53:09,176
There this space God
and he's himself

1110
00:53:09,219 --> 00:53:11,483
and he sent himself
on a suicide mission.

1111
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:14,547
He's a God, but he has a kid.
He's a single parent.

1112
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:18,527
It's just silly, but when you put it
in the water analogy,

1113
00:53:18,562 --> 00:53:20,792
I can see that, you know,
those ladies there,

1114
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:22,957
when they heard that the first time,
they were like, done.

1115
00:53:22,999 --> 00:53:26,730
Sold. Oh, you had me
at ice cube.

1116
00:53:26,770 --> 00:53:29,398
Moving on.
Does it ever bother you

1117
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:32,931
that the story of a man

1118
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:36,377
who was born of a virgin
was resurrected?

1119
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:39,610
Your bio was something that was
going around the Mediterranean

1120
00:53:39,649 --> 00:53:41,344
for at least 1,000 years.

1121
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:44,046
We've got Krishna who was in India

1122
00:53:44,087 --> 00:53:46,681
1,000 years before Christ.
Krishna was a carpenter,

1123
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,419
born of a virgin, baptized in a river.

1124
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,427
Are you saying that
was written in history?

1125
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,224
That was written down in history,
is that what you're saying?

1126
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:56,926
Absolutely, there's the Persian god
Mithra, 600 years before Christ.

1127
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,595
Born December 25th,
performed miracles,

1128
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:01,536
resurrected on the third day,

1129
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:05,029
known as the Lamb, the Way, the Truth,
the Light, the Savior, Messiah.

1130
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,202
Stop! Blasphemer!

1131
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:09,508
All I know is that
I don't go by that hearsay.

1132
00:54:09,546 --> 00:54:12,743
I go by the word of God.
I know that's why I believe.

1133
00:54:12,782 --> 00:54:15,683
- Well, I believe it because it's truth.
- Believe it, yes.

1134
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,210
But there's a difference
between truth and what you believe.

1135
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,520
In the Bible it tells us that all things
are possible with God, okay?

1136
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:23,788
Study the religions
of the Mediterranean region

1137
00:54:23,827 --> 00:54:25,385
for a thousand years before.

1138
00:54:25,428 --> 00:54:29,296
Many of the gods were born
on December 25th.

1139
00:54:29,332 --> 00:54:31,994
- No, it's not.
- It's not a new one.

1140
00:54:32,035 --> 00:54:34,060
It's funny you should bring
that up because of course

1141
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,765
in " Star Wars: Episode l...
The Phantom Menace,"

1142
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:37,466
Anakin is born to a virgin.

1143
00:54:37,507 --> 00:54:38,838
People see that
and say, " Wait a second.

1144
00:54:38,875 --> 00:54:41,105
Where have we heard that before?"
That's not original.

1145
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:43,908
- But the Jesus story wasn't original.
- How so?

1146
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:36,858
Let me ask you a question.
Let's say, if you take the side

1147
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:40,165
- that this is all made up...
- I do.

1148
00:55:40,203 --> 00:55:41,534
...what if you're wrong?

1149
00:55:42,972 --> 00:55:44,701
What if you're wrong?

1150
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:59,119
# Down the Via Dolorosa #

1151
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:02,682
# In Jerusalem that day #

1152
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:04,990
# The soldiers tried #

1153
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:08,555
# To clear
the narrow street #

1154
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:13,901
# But the crowd
pressed in to see #

1155
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:16,167
# The man condemned to die #

1156
00:56:16,206 --> 00:56:19,266
# On Calvary #

1157
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:24,207
# Down the Via Dolorosa #

1158
00:56:24,247 --> 00:56:27,944
# Called the Way of Suffering #

1159
00:56:27,984 --> 00:56:31,215
# Like a lamb came the Messiah #

1160
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:33,518
# Christ the King #

1161
00:56:35,225 --> 00:56:38,194
# And he chose to walk that road #

1162
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,288
# Out of his love #

1163
00:56:41,331 --> 00:56:43,561
# For you #

1164
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,933
# And me. #

1165
00:57:06,990 --> 00:57:09,220
Was Jesus a sinner?

1166
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,888
One master. One word.
I am your master.

1167
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:18,658
Who do we put away
in the asylums?

1168
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,301
Xenu brought us here

1169
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:30,312
75 million years ago,

1170
00:57:30,346 --> 00:57:33,042
stacked us around volcanoes

1171
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:35,346
and blew them up with an H-bomb.

1172
00:57:38,721 --> 00:57:40,712
We are older than the universe.

1173
00:57:44,694 --> 00:57:46,958
You have to rid yourself

1174
00:57:46,996 --> 00:57:48,623
of the implants

1175
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:51,759
from the extraterrestrial dictators!

1176
00:57:55,405 --> 00:57:59,034
- Get an E-Meter. Yes, get an E-Meter!
- An E-meter?

1177
00:58:02,679 --> 00:58:04,146
Audit yourself.

1178
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:10,577
How do you people expect
to get to the next level?

1179
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,248
I'm not making the rules.

1180
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:19,017
Aw...

1181
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:23,464
You know, Scientologists...

1182
00:58:26,503 --> 00:58:30,405
And right, you're like,
"Oh, yeah, that's some crazy shit. Okay.

1183
00:58:30,440 --> 00:58:33,375
Jesus with the virgin birth
and the dove and the snake

1184
00:58:33,409 --> 00:58:36,810
who talked in the garden,
that's cool.

1185
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:40,009
But the Scientologists,
they're the crazy ones."

1186
00:58:40,049 --> 00:58:41,209
That's not true.

1187
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:43,412
That... that...
I don't have any idea

1188
00:58:43,453 --> 00:58:45,683
of what
you're talking about.

1189
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:47,747
But it has something to do
with making sure

1190
00:58:47,790 --> 00:58:49,985
that we're born with a defect,

1191
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,823
so that the souls of ours

1192
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,227
are infected with aliens...

1193
00:58:54,264 --> 00:58:56,732
Thank you.

1194
00:58:56,766 --> 00:59:00,725
...because the cure?
Scientology.

1195
00:59:00,770 --> 00:59:04,206
They're all crazy.
Yes, the religions do get even crazier.

1196
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:06,731
They have to to keep up.

1197
00:59:06,776 --> 00:59:09,210
They keep raising the bar.
After you've done the virgin birth,

1198
00:59:09,245 --> 00:59:11,406
you know,
where do you go?

1199
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:30,093
We're not getting the top?

1200
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:31,862
- We got the top.
- Oh, okay.

1201
00:59:31,901 --> 00:59:33,960
That's the Mormon Temple
behind me.

1202
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:36,699
To be a Mormon is to believe
some really crazy stuff,

1203
00:59:36,739 --> 00:59:40,197
crazy even by the standards
of the big religions.

1204
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,733
When you're the new kid
on the block...

1205
00:59:43,346 --> 00:59:46,543
Thank you.
That was helpful.

1206
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,107
You're the new kid
on the block

1207
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:49,914
and all the good crazy has
already been picked over,

1208
00:59:49,953 --> 00:59:52,444
so you kind of have to up the ante.

1209
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:53,921
Oh.

1210
00:59:53,957 --> 00:59:55,822
God damn it.

1211
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:58,349
Not while
I'm in the middle of it.

1212
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:02,798
Well, we do have it.

1213
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:03,924
Boy, a lot of people came

1214
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,696
- out of the woodwork.
- Yeah.

1215
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:13,469
So did you guys get anybody
from the church to talk to?

1216
01:00:13,509 --> 01:00:16,171
Well, if you count getting
thrown off the property

1217
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:19,670
- "talked to."
- That's probably better.

1218
01:00:19,716 --> 01:00:22,981
We'd like you
to "Meet the Mormons."

1219
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:25,385
In the founding scripture,
you open up the Doctrine of Covenants,

1220
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:27,548
you read the autobiography
of Joseph Smith.

1221
01:00:27,590 --> 01:00:30,753
He quotes Jesus Christ as telling him

1222
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:33,023
that every other creed
on earth is, quote,

1223
01:00:33,062 --> 01:00:35,189
"an abomination."
An abomination.

1224
01:00:35,231 --> 01:00:37,665
I mean, that's not
a very ecumenical statement.

1225
01:00:37,700 --> 01:00:40,692
You're talking about things that,
I think, at some level

1226
01:00:40,737 --> 01:00:43,365
you sense just
do not make sense.

1227
01:00:43,406 --> 01:00:46,569
I'm glad you said that because I read
some of the tenets of Mormonism,

1228
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:49,772
like " God lives on a planet
near the star of Kalob."

1229
01:00:49,812 --> 01:00:51,541
- Kolob.
- Kolob.

1230
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:54,516
God the Father who's a physical man
with a body of flesh and bone

1231
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:58,111
is probably about 6' tall,
lives on a place called Kolob,

1232
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:01,487
had sexual relations with Mary...
remember he's a man.

1233
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:04,049
"Jesus Christ was conceived
by God the father

1234
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:06,118
having actual sex with Mary."

1235
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,528
Mary said, " If this is what God wants,

1236
01:01:08,564 --> 01:01:10,395
I'll be glad to do His will."

1237
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:12,401
"Dark skin is a curse from God,

1238
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:14,027
but if you're sufficiently righteous,

1239
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:15,230
a dark-skinned person

1240
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:17,535
can become light-skinned."

1241
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:20,007
According to
the Book of Mormon,

1242
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:22,511
after his resurrection,
Jesus came to the Americas

1243
01:01:22,545 --> 01:01:24,479
to preach to the Indians.

1244
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,574
"That American Indians are
actually a lost tribe of Israel."

1245
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:28,811
They're lost Jews.

1246
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,444
And also the idea

1247
01:01:32,488 --> 01:01:34,979
that Christianity
is American,

1248
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:37,515
I think, is an amazing
entitlement to a people

1249
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:41,326
who are always trying
to meld God and country.

1250
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:44,697
The Garden of Eden was
in Missouri according to Mormonism.

1251
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:46,599
The new Jerusalem
will be there.

1252
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,536
Branson, I'm hoping.

1253
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:51,506
I've also heard that the Mormon Church
baptizes dead people.

1254
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,839
You can be baptized
for about 50 people,

1255
01:01:53,876 --> 01:01:55,901
100 people that've died.

1256
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:58,675
And so you just get dunked
about 50 to 100 times.

1257
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,273
That's baptism for the dead.

1258
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:03,251
Caffeine is evil.
That magic underwear can protect you.

1259
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:14,291
And that you need
a secret password to get into heaven.

1260
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,628
Everyone must stand
at the final judgment

1261
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:19,601
before Joseph Smith,
Jesus and Elohim.

1262
01:02:19,635 --> 01:02:21,102
This isn't an easy religion.

1263
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:24,106
Why do you think it is that
so few people

1264
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,233
do what you have done
and leave the church?

1265
01:02:26,275 --> 01:02:28,505
The moment you acknowledge
to yourself that Joseph Smith

1266
01:02:28,544 --> 01:02:32,503
did not tell the truth about
his experiences and his achievements,

1267
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:35,381
you just committed
social suicide.

1268
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,249
- Family and friends...
- Family and friends.

1269
01:02:37,286 --> 01:02:39,481
...will... you're off the deep end.

1270
01:02:39,522 --> 01:02:42,821
Dr. Andrew Newberg,
nice to meet you.

1271
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:47,091
I've finally met someone
who's studied... neurotheology.

1272
01:02:47,130 --> 01:02:49,325
This is getting very close
to something I always say,

1273
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:52,732
which is that religion is
a neurological disorder.

1274
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:55,636
What does the brain look like
when it's hopped up on God?

1275
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:57,832
We see a lot of different colors,
which help us to...

1276
01:02:57,874 --> 01:02:59,637
tell us what
the activity is in the brain

1277
01:02:59,675 --> 01:03:02,576
and what we have found is that
there are some very specific changes

1278
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:05,103
when people are actually
meditating or praying

1279
01:03:05,148 --> 01:03:07,582
or even speaking in tongues,
which was our last study.

1280
01:03:07,617 --> 01:03:10,085
In the name of Jesus,

1281
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:12,747
you've been made whole
by the power of God.

1282
01:03:12,789 --> 01:03:14,950
- Speaking in tongues?
- We studied people speaking in tongues.

1283
01:03:14,991 --> 01:03:17,118
They're just babbling,
though, right?

1284
01:03:20,363 --> 01:03:22,422
They're not really speaking
in a language they don't know.

1285
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:25,434
It's not an actual language,
but what's...

1286
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,095
Just bullshit, Doc,
come on.

1287
01:03:27,136 --> 01:03:28,967
Isn't that something?

1288
01:03:41,884 --> 01:03:44,284
I love you.

1289
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:47,653
So you would agree that
even if a billion people

1290
01:03:47,690 --> 01:03:50,158
believe something,
it can still be ridiculous?

1291
01:03:50,193 --> 01:03:52,525
- Absolutely.
- But the Jews, I mean, they're...

1292
01:03:52,562 --> 01:03:55,326
excuse me, Jewish friends...
but they're as cuckoo as anybody,

1293
01:03:55,364 --> 01:03:57,332
especially the really Orthodox ones.

1294
01:03:57,366 --> 01:04:00,927
You are one of the
few Jewish people in the world

1295
01:04:00,970 --> 01:04:02,961
who does not believe
in the state of Israel.

1296
01:04:03,005 --> 01:04:04,438
You do not think the state

1297
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:07,738
- of Israel should exist.
- Correct.

1298
01:04:07,777 --> 01:04:09,870
- Okay.
- God gave us the land of Israel.

1299
01:04:09,912 --> 01:04:14,008
On Mount Sinai where we made
this bond with God,

1300
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:16,610
He said, " I'm giving you the land,
but I'm stipulating...

1301
01:04:16,652 --> 01:04:20,053
very clearly stipulating... you must
be on a certain level of holiness."

1302
01:04:20,089 --> 01:04:21,818
You will see it clearly
that we were sent out of the land.

1303
01:04:21,858 --> 01:04:23,985
So basically you're saying that

1304
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:26,187
the Jewish people have
not been holy enough

1305
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:28,197
to deserve
the land of Israel.

1306
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:30,096
God understands what is good for us,
what is bad for us...

1307
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:32,327
- First of all...
...what will bring us safety or not.

1308
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:33,357
Let me just finish.

1309
01:04:33,402 --> 01:04:35,529
God told us, though,
if you will go against God...

1310
01:04:35,571 --> 01:04:37,869
- God manipulates the world...
- Okay, l...

1311
01:04:37,907 --> 01:04:39,704
Wait a second.
Let me finish this.

1312
01:04:39,742 --> 01:04:41,767
God said if you're going
to try to make the state,

1313
01:04:41,811 --> 01:04:43,870
you will be unsuccessful.

1314
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,471
You are looking through...

1315
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:48,449
you're trying to look
at this world through a keyhole.

1316
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:50,611
I'm looking through the key...

1317
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:52,951
Let me finish.
God is compassionate.

1318
01:04:52,989 --> 01:04:54,957
Everything is directly
from God, we believe.

1319
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:57,926
- But it seems to me...
- I'll now explain what you're asking.

1320
01:04:57,960 --> 01:05:00,121
The concept of saying

1321
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:02,722
that we've suffered
enough anti-Semitism...

1322
01:05:02,765 --> 01:05:04,426
Never again.

1323
01:05:04,467 --> 01:05:07,630
So you don't say "Never again."
You say "Again."

1324
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:10,639
Yeah. Let us understand
that the Jewish people

1325
01:05:10,673 --> 01:05:12,368
were living in exile
for 2,000 years

1326
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:14,205
under God's protection

1327
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:16,211
and we were living
in Western civilization...

1328
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,338
- Germany, Poland. Not anymore...
- Let me finish.

1329
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:20,315
We were living amongst
all nations throughout the years.

1330
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:22,476
...'cause they're all dead.
How many people died in the Holocaust?

1331
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:25,919
You're jumping.
Let's jump to the Holocaust.

1332
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:28,583
I thought the issue
was Jewish safety.

1333
01:05:28,624 --> 01:05:30,751
I thought the issue was
how many Jews are dying.

1334
01:05:30,793 --> 01:05:32,818
So let's talk
about Jewish safety.

1335
01:05:32,862 --> 01:05:34,853
Okay, I'm sure there was a few...

1336
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:38,560
A couple million Jews died,
that's okay, that's the wording you use?

1337
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:42,037
You're the one who went
to Iran in December 2006

1338
01:05:42,071 --> 01:05:43,766
for the president

1339
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:47,105
of that country's
Holocaust "denial" conference.

1340
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:48,974
Whoa, don't just throw words.

1341
01:06:00,156 --> 01:06:03,319
Why does Ahmadinejad say
that he wants Israel

1342
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:04,883
- to be wiped from the face of the...
- When did he say that?

1343
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,861
- He did.
- He never said that.

1344
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:08,454
What did he say?
What was the exact quote?

1345
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:12,695
- He said it should disappear.
- What, is he David Copperfield?

1346
01:06:12,735 --> 01:06:15,966
- That's chutzpah.
- Never again, Rabbi, never again.

1347
01:06:16,005 --> 01:06:17,870
Wait. One more second.

1348
01:06:17,907 --> 01:06:20,171
No, I'm out.

1349
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:24,111
We have Conservatives.
We have Reforms.

1350
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:25,408
We have the Orthodox.

1351
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:28,042
You are an observing Jew.

1352
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:29,949
It says it right there
in the fourth commandment:

1353
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,477
Honor the Sabbath day
to keep it holy.

1354
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:35,490
Friday night to Saturday night,
you don't do anything.

1355
01:06:35,524 --> 01:06:39,551
Yeah, the rabbis over the centuries
have created these prohibitions

1356
01:06:39,595 --> 01:06:42,029
as a way to try
to protect the day of rest.

1357
01:06:42,064 --> 01:06:45,864
You can't use electricity.
You can't drive.

1358
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:49,496
Let's talk a little about
keeping the Sabbath holy.

1359
01:06:49,538 --> 01:06:52,063
I've always wondered
if it came about

1360
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:55,168
because God rested
on the Sabbath

1361
01:06:55,211 --> 01:06:57,179
and that's why man has to.

1362
01:06:57,213 --> 01:06:59,181
That's right,
and that was the creation

1363
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:01,080
of the seventh day,
that there should be rest.

1364
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:04,553
There are 39 types of specific actions

1365
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:07,078
that cannot be done on the Sabbath.

1366
01:07:07,123 --> 01:07:08,715
One of them is lighting a fire.

1367
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,487
Planting. Another one is plowing.

1368
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,323
Another one is
tying a knot, untying a knot.

1369
01:07:12,361 --> 01:07:15,330
One is building, and one is
destroying so as to build.

1370
01:07:15,364 --> 01:07:18,492
So much more kosher is
to develop these gadgets

1371
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,934
- that figure out a way around it.
- That's right.

1372
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,666
It does seem that you are,
to a degree,

1373
01:07:23,706 --> 01:07:25,765
trying to outsmart God.

1374
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:29,107
If the lawmaker never
makes a mistake,

1375
01:07:29,145 --> 01:07:33,013
and still there's a loophole there,
why is that loophole there?

1376
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:35,415
To be used in a situation of need.

1377
01:07:35,451 --> 01:07:37,851
But how did this get updated

1378
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,514
for a 4,000-year-old rule?

1379
01:07:39,555 --> 01:07:41,420
It seems there's an awful lot

1380
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,118
that has to do with electricity.

1381
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,218
Rabbi Halperin's work here
is translating it

1382
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,229
into something more modern.

1383
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:52,034
Let's look at some
of the gadgets you have.

1384
01:07:52,068 --> 01:07:55,595
I'm particularly interested in
the phone. Is there not a cell phone?

1385
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:57,401
It's not a cell phone.

1386
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,032
Okay, wow.

1387
01:07:59,075 --> 01:08:01,771
I have to say,
that looks modern.

1388
01:08:03,012 --> 01:08:06,573
Each number is trying
to dial itself all the time.

1389
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,451
Hello. Hello.

1390
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:13,148
When I take the stick

1391
01:08:13,189 --> 01:08:15,885
- and I put it into the hole...
- Hello.

1392
01:08:15,925 --> 01:08:18,018
...l'm inhibiting that
which is inhibiting

1393
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:20,927
the number from dialing itself.

1394
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:23,932
Let me ask about this.
It's obviously a wheelchair.

1395
01:08:23,966 --> 01:08:26,093
- May I?
- Sure.

1396
01:08:28,037 --> 01:08:30,972
Oh, wow.

1397
01:08:31,006 --> 01:08:33,270
And this is not the new model,
I'm guessing.

1398
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:35,607
- This is the experimental prototype.
- I see.

1399
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:37,976
Schmuck!

1400
01:08:38,013 --> 01:08:41,642
- This runs on air pressure, right?
- Correct.

1401
01:08:41,684 --> 01:08:43,811
Basically, we've got
150 atmospheres

1402
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:45,821
of pressure here.

1403
01:08:45,855 --> 01:08:48,323
We've got the turning it on,
turning it off here.

1404
01:08:48,357 --> 01:08:50,518
So air is okay.

1405
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,494
- Air good. Fire bad.
- Fire bad.

1406
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:55,861
Fire bad!

1407
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:57,991
We've taken an old bicycle...

1408
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,496
- I forgot what it's called.
- Tire.

1409
01:09:02,538 --> 01:09:05,803
Okay. Air goes in,
air goes out.

1410
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,502
If I was a person
in that wheelchair,

1411
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:10,603
I might say to myself,
"Why am I going to these lengths

1412
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:14,138
to please God, who's taken away
my legs to begin with?"

1413
01:09:14,183 --> 01:09:17,516
Okay.

1414
01:09:17,553 --> 01:09:19,680
That would be fascinating.
It's an elevator.

1415
01:09:19,722 --> 01:09:21,747
Oh, it's a Shabbatavator.

1416
01:09:21,790 --> 01:09:23,849
Let me guess,
you can't push a button...

1417
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:26,418
- Correct.
...on the Sabbath.

1418
01:09:26,462 --> 01:09:30,228
The issues behind the scenes that
people don't see are the real problems.

1419
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:32,564
An even bigger problem might
be how do you get someone

1420
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:36,230
to put this in their building if
they're not completely nuts?

1421
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,797
Well, actually, that really
doesn't make a difference.

1422
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,069
Hmm.

1423
01:09:40,109 --> 01:09:42,600
How we define what is
crazy or not crazy

1424
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:47,207
about religions is ultimately up
to how we define crazy.

1425
01:09:47,249 --> 01:09:49,911
If you define mental illness
as anyone who hears a voice

1426
01:09:49,952 --> 01:09:53,388
talking to them, then anyone who has
heard the voice of God is crazy.

1427
01:10:11,407 --> 01:10:13,204
She talks about a prophecy

1428
01:10:13,242 --> 01:10:16,370
that these children needed to die.

1429
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:20,777
The dispatcher asked
"Why did you do this?"

1430
01:10:20,816 --> 01:10:23,649
"I was told to."
"Who told you?" "God."

1431
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,024
There is nothing

1432
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,424
He may not ask of thee?

1433
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:34,820
But in layman's terms,
Jesus was nuts.

1434
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:37,593
Moses..." Stay here,
I'm going up

1435
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:39,726
and getting the 10 Commandments
right from God."

1436
01:10:39,768 --> 01:10:41,827
You know, 'cause one
thing I've also...

1437
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:44,464
We didn't have brain-scan technology
back then, so it's a hard to tell.

1438
01:10:44,506 --> 01:10:47,270
I know, but if a guy says he went
up on a mountain and he talked to God,

1439
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:49,334
and He talked to him
through a burning bush,

1440
01:10:49,378 --> 01:10:51,312
that guy's a cuckoo.

1441
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:11,997
All those pastors who refer to me

1442
01:11:12,034 --> 01:11:15,003
as the anti-Christ, false prophet,

1443
01:11:15,037 --> 01:11:17,597
it's because they're miserable.

1444
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:21,235
Anyone who doesn't believe
in me is miserable.

1445
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:29,543
- My mike is on?
- Yes, sir.

1446
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:31,883
Okay, who are you Biblically?

1447
01:11:31,920 --> 01:11:36,653
I am Jesus Christ man,
the second coming of Christ, I am.

1448
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:38,990
The Old Testament speaks
about me clearly

1449
01:11:39,028 --> 01:11:40,689
and the New Testament also.

1450
01:11:40,729 --> 01:11:43,129
- About you personally?
- Yes.

1451
01:11:43,165 --> 01:11:46,566
Not just because you have...
you share the name Jesus?

1452
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:49,366
- No, not because of that.
- You also share the name Miranda.

1453
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:51,100
Maybe you're Carmen Miranda.

1454
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,131
Maybe the second coming of her?

1455
01:11:53,175 --> 01:11:56,667
You should have fruit on your head,
instead of fruit in your head.

1456
01:11:58,681 --> 01:12:00,342
Okay. Fuck you.
How's that?

1457
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:03,783
Why do you think
God chose you?

1458
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:06,845
Jesus of Nazareth had a wife

1459
01:12:06,889 --> 01:12:09,824
so after they killed him,

1460
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:13,794
his seed kept going,
maybe through France, Spain,

1461
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:17,162
and then from Spain,
came to Puerto Rico.

1462
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:22,334
The bloodline come
from Abraham, Abraham to David,

1463
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:24,032
David to Jesus of Nazareth,

1464
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:26,701
Jesus of Nazareth, me.

1465
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:29,233
Okay, I though a second coming

1466
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:32,076
was the reincarnation

1467
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:34,344
of the Christ himself,

1468
01:12:34,383 --> 01:12:36,613
not a descendant of.

1469
01:12:36,652 --> 01:12:38,517
No, he's a descendant.

1470
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:41,682
Descendant? Oh... but
you don't believe in hell?

1471
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:43,783
- No.
- Or the Devil?

1472
01:12:43,826 --> 01:12:46,351
- No.
- Or even sin, right?

1473
01:12:46,395 --> 01:12:48,659
No, there's not
a sin any longer.

1474
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:52,656
What you teach is that
Jesus died for our sins

1475
01:12:52,701 --> 01:12:56,137
and so there's not really
any sinning anymore.

1476
01:12:56,171 --> 01:12:59,766
- No more sin.
- This is like a diet doctor saying,

1477
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,605
- "Eat anything you want."
- Right.

1478
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:03,907
"You don't lose weight,
but it's easy to stick to."

1479
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:05,072
That's what I believe, Bill.

1480
01:13:05,114 --> 01:13:07,014
Oh, I know you do.

1481
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:09,609
And I have many people
who believe in this.

1482
01:13:09,651 --> 01:13:11,619
And yet, you have a little...
you have a little twinkle

1483
01:13:11,653 --> 01:13:13,621
in your eye when say it.

1484
01:13:13,655 --> 01:13:16,681
No, I believe in that.
I believe.

1485
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:20,684
How do we know? Because lots
of people would like this job.

1486
01:13:20,729 --> 01:13:22,594
How do you get this job
as the second coming?

1487
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:24,189
It's not on Craigslist.

1488
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,793
- Yeah.
- I'm guessing. Maybe it is.

1489
01:13:26,835 --> 01:13:27,961
See, two angels...

1490
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:30,267
Two guys named Angel,
Spanish guys.

1491
01:13:31,673 --> 01:13:33,368
You know what I'm talking about,

1492
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,969
you fucking cockroach!

1493
01:13:36,011 --> 01:13:37,979
- No.
- Oh, actual angels.

1494
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:40,311
- Two angels came to me...
- Okay.

1495
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,613
...and they told me

1496
01:13:42,651 --> 01:13:45,142
"The Lord of Lords
and King of Kings

1497
01:13:45,187 --> 01:13:48,088
is coming to anoint you
for the ministry tonight."

1498
01:13:48,123 --> 01:13:50,717
What form did the angels come in?
How tall?

1499
01:13:50,759 --> 01:13:52,750
Little tall and strong.

1500
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:54,592
Whatever they told me,
I obey.

1501
01:13:54,630 --> 01:13:56,723
I don't wanna mess
with them.

1502
01:13:56,765 --> 01:13:58,289
But I'm just saying,

1503
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:00,927
it seems that if God wanted

1504
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:03,267
to communicate something
to the world...

1505
01:14:03,305 --> 01:14:05,432
He's all powerful...

1506
01:14:05,474 --> 01:14:08,568
He would just talk
to the whole world.

1507
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:11,977
It always seems
He picks out a prophet in private

1508
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:14,949
and tells them,
"Okay, you're the prophet."

1509
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:17,645
- I am.
- "You go tell the rest of the world."

1510
01:14:17,686 --> 01:14:19,415
So we just sort of
have to take it on faith.

1511
01:14:19,455 --> 01:14:21,650
We just sort of
have to believe you.

1512
01:14:21,690 --> 01:14:23,817
Right, yeah, it's true.

1513
01:14:26,862 --> 01:14:29,854
Abraham. Noah.

1514
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:32,423
Lord, what shall I do?

1515
01:14:32,468 --> 01:14:33,958
Moses,

1516
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:36,527
climb the mount alone.

1517
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:39,507
Once again, the Lord had
spoken to Joseph Smith

1518
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:41,941
as he had to Adam, Abraham,

1519
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:45,708
Moses, Paul and others.

1520
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:47,772
I am the first Christian.

1521
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:51,445
And the rest are really
kind of Jewish, you're saying,

1522
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,512
because they're following a Jew.

1523
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:55,182
That's it.

1524
01:14:55,224 --> 01:14:57,192
In fact, they put on the plates...

1525
01:14:57,226 --> 01:15:00,093
they say " My boss is
a Jewish carpenter."

1526
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:03,620
How ridiculous is that?
A Jewish carpenter!

1527
01:15:03,665 --> 01:15:06,133
- Imagine.
- Come on, Jews hire carpenters.

1528
01:15:06,168 --> 01:15:07,795
They don't...

1529
01:15:07,836 --> 01:15:11,135
you know, people say
"I found my calling in life."

1530
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,403
And it's a good calling.
It's a nice living.

1531
01:15:13,442 --> 01:15:15,808
People adore you.
Everywhere you go,

1532
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:18,677
they treat you like Christ,
like you're the Messiah.

1533
01:15:18,714 --> 01:15:22,115
You know, if I discovered
that I was Satan in person,

1534
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:24,015
I would do a good job, too,

1535
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:26,520
because I would be
faithful to my calling.

1536
01:15:26,555 --> 01:15:28,819
It's how you do
your work, isn't it?

1537
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:30,791
You know, at the end of the day,
whether you're the Messiah

1538
01:15:30,826 --> 01:15:33,294
or you're Satan,
it's loving what you do

1539
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:35,091
and giving it 100%.

1540
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:37,064
I give 100%.

1541
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:40,830
I wasn't born skeptical.

1542
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:43,997
I was still making deals
with "God" when I was 40.

1543
01:15:44,039 --> 01:15:45,939
I remember I quit smoking.

1544
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:48,374
There was some shitty problem
I had in my life,

1545
01:15:48,410 --> 01:15:50,173
and I made
a deal with God,

1546
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:52,237
"Okay, if you make
this problem go away,

1547
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:55,148
I will quit smoking,
and I won't go back on it

1548
01:15:55,183 --> 01:15:57,913
'cause I'd know I'd be going back
on a deal with God."

1549
01:15:57,953 --> 01:15:59,750
And you know, I gotta say,

1550
01:15:59,788 --> 01:16:02,382
I'm kind of glad I had "God"

1551
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:04,119
in my life.

1552
01:16:04,159 --> 01:16:06,627
You are the head

1553
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:11,065
of the First Universal Church
of Cantheism...

1554
01:16:11,099 --> 01:16:13,693
- Yes.
...which is really built around

1555
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:16,465
- this substance here.
- No.

1556
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:19,633
No? Okay, I got that wrong.

1557
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:21,700
But it's built
around smoking this.

1558
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,041
I mean, it has no dogma, right?

1559
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:25,706
You're not preaching to anybody.
You're not saying

1560
01:16:25,747 --> 01:16:28,477
- you'll save their souls, no rituals.
- No.

1561
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:30,542
How does this differ
from just getting wasted?

1562
01:16:30,586 --> 01:16:32,713
I mean that
in the best possible way, but...

1563
01:16:32,754 --> 01:16:34,949
I understand
the concept of God,

1564
01:16:34,990 --> 01:16:38,153
a feeling of one
with everything else.

1565
01:16:38,193 --> 01:16:40,787
Do you feel that
every time you smoke pot?

1566
01:16:40,829 --> 01:16:42,956
No.

1567
01:16:42,998 --> 01:16:45,330
Phew! I thought it was just me.

1568
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:48,962
So why do you think
it's this family of drugs

1569
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:52,098
that's so good
for opening our minds

1570
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,074
as opposed to ludes, PCP,

1571
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:57,545
or smashing up your mother's diet pills
and smoking 'em in a pipe?

1572
01:16:59,181 --> 01:17:01,376
I don't know.
I don't know.

1573
01:17:05,320 --> 01:17:07,584
So I did want
to get your thoughts

1574
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:10,217
about what's going on in this city.
This is your city.

1575
01:17:10,258 --> 01:17:13,159
There's a lot
of controversy with...

1576
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:15,322
maybe the Dutch
are so tolerant

1577
01:17:15,364 --> 01:17:18,299
that they're now
tolerating intolerance.

1578
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:20,927
There's a lot of tension
with the Muslim community.

1579
01:17:20,969 --> 01:17:24,132
It's all religious fundamentalists.

1580
01:17:24,172 --> 01:17:26,572
They already killed
Theo Van Gogh,

1581
01:17:26,608 --> 01:17:29,702
who was a known
television maker.

1582
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:33,272
This is the spot
where Theo Van Gogh

1583
01:17:33,315 --> 01:17:36,216
- was assassinated?
- This is exactly the spot.

1584
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:38,776
He was a Dutch filmmaker.
He made a 10-minute film.

1585
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:42,586
It was deeply offensive
to Muslims.

1586
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:45,923
Oh, Allah, you say
that men are the protectors

1587
01:17:45,961 --> 01:17:47,861
and maintainers of women

1588
01:17:47,896 --> 01:17:50,660
because you have given
the one more strength than the other.

1589
01:17:50,699 --> 01:17:52,428
I feel at least once a week,

1590
01:17:52,467 --> 01:17:55,061
the strength of my husband's fist

1591
01:17:55,103 --> 01:17:56,832
on my face.

1592
01:17:56,872 --> 01:17:59,363
Lots of people think
that free speech

1593
01:17:59,408 --> 01:18:04,175
goes right up to this point and then
when you're talking about religion,

1594
01:18:04,212 --> 01:18:07,704
when you're talking
about the Prophet, all bets are off.

1595
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:09,842
It goes both ways,
freedom of speech.

1596
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:12,445
It goes both ways,
but the people who actually...

1597
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:16,321
usually do the killing for it
wind up on the Muslim side.

1598
01:18:16,358 --> 01:18:19,350
Do you think that says something
about the different cultures?

1599
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:21,828
I don't want to have
the image of the Muslims,

1600
01:18:21,863 --> 01:18:23,524
you know, if they don't like
something you say,

1601
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:25,032
they kill you, because it's not.

1602
01:18:26,601 --> 01:18:30,367
It was a noisy crowd outside
the Danish embassy in London

1603
01:18:30,405 --> 01:18:34,102
as speakers condemned the cartoons
portraying the Prophet Mohammed.

1604
01:18:34,142 --> 01:18:37,634
I wish I could get
your music in America,

1605
01:18:37,679 --> 01:18:41,843
but considering how controversial
it's been here in England...

1606
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:49,154
Initially, when I did the record,

1607
01:18:49,191 --> 01:18:51,386
a lot of people supported it,

1608
01:18:51,426 --> 01:18:54,589
but then,
in the current times that we're in,

1609
01:18:54,629 --> 01:18:56,119
people got really scared.

1610
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:58,655
It just shows
the stupidity of society,

1611
01:18:58,700 --> 01:19:02,101
which refuses
to discuss,

1612
01:19:02,137 --> 01:19:05,072
debate things
in an intelligent way.

1613
01:19:05,107 --> 01:19:06,631
And I don't except that.

1614
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:08,540
I just put my middle finger up.

1615
01:19:08,577 --> 01:19:10,943
One of your big gripes...
and it's a valid one...

1616
01:19:10,979 --> 01:19:14,346
you keep saying that...
in fact, let me read your quote.

1617
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:16,350
You said, " Anyone worried
about what I'm saying

1618
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:20,115
should get involved in the debate.
You are allowed to dissent.

1619
01:19:20,155 --> 01:19:22,419
- That is a right."
- Yeah.

1620
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:26,052
But is that a right
in Islam, to dissent?

1621
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:28,187
Of course it is. Why do you think
there's so many schools of thought?

1622
01:19:28,230 --> 01:19:31,961
- Why do you think there's...
- It wasn't a right for Salman Rushdie.

1623
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:33,968
The demonstrators set off
from Hyde Park,

1624
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:36,664
bringing much
of central London to a standstill.

1625
01:19:36,705 --> 01:19:39,902
Their hatred focused
on Salman Rushdie and his book.

1626
01:19:39,941 --> 01:19:42,774
The mullahs pressed home
their message in thousands of mosques...

1627
01:19:42,811 --> 01:19:44,802
Salman Rushdie must be killed.

1628
01:19:44,846 --> 01:19:47,542
See, Salman Rushdie
was there to provoke,

1629
01:19:47,582 --> 01:19:50,380
insult, and he did it
intentionally, right?

1630
01:19:50,418 --> 01:19:52,079
But should you die
for that?

1631
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:54,452
No no, well, I mean,
like, that was...

1632
01:19:54,489 --> 01:19:56,184
you know, it's easy
for you to say

1633
01:19:56,224 --> 01:19:58,317
things are kind of
in black and white.

1634
01:19:58,360 --> 01:20:00,726
They're more complex than that.

1635
01:20:00,762 --> 01:20:02,957
There's emotions and passions

1636
01:20:02,998 --> 01:20:04,989
and philosophy involved

1637
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:07,627
- and all that stuff.
- You know, all you gotta say is

1638
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:11,161
it's wrong for someone
to have to suffer a death threat

1639
01:20:11,206 --> 01:20:13,731
- for writing a book.
- Well, hang on.

1640
01:20:13,775 --> 01:20:15,265
But apparently, it's more
complicated than that.

1641
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:18,040
Well, it is because...
but I mean, Western...

1642
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:20,479
We'll never see
eye to eye there,

1643
01:20:20,515 --> 01:20:22,847
but you want that
protection for yourself.

1644
01:20:22,884 --> 01:20:24,852
No, I think
these debates are a lot...

1645
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:28,720
I'm willing to discuss 'em
in terms of facts and not fictions.

1646
01:20:28,757 --> 01:20:30,281
When you disagree with me,
it's a fiction.

1647
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:32,190
- No no.
- You have the truth

1648
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:33,717
- and I have the fiction.
- No, I don't have the truth.

1649
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:35,627
But you don't see that
there's a fundamental hypocrisy

1650
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:37,757
of you asking
for the right to dissent

1651
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:39,892
and somebody else
getting a death threat?

1652
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:43,234
No no, 'cause my dissent is
to stop the madness.

1653
01:20:48,643 --> 01:20:50,668
I'm here with Geert Wilders
here in The Hague,

1654
01:20:50,712 --> 01:20:52,339
which of course is
home to the World Court,

1655
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,177
but also to the Dutch Parliament.

1656
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:57,344
You are taking
a kind of hard line here

1657
01:20:57,385 --> 01:20:59,080
in the Netherlands.

1658
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:02,419
Islam is, according to me,
a violent religion.

1659
01:21:02,457 --> 01:21:04,425
The Koran is a violent book

1660
01:21:04,459 --> 01:21:06,427
and Mohammed was
a violent prophet.

1661
01:21:06,461 --> 01:21:08,929
Do you think Islam wants
to take over the world?

1662
01:21:08,964 --> 01:21:11,125
- They don't even make...
- Right right.

1663
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:12,861
...a secret about it.

1664
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:14,425
We are infidels.

1665
01:21:14,469 --> 01:21:17,700
I mean, we should either become
Islamic or we should be killed.

1666
01:21:17,739 --> 01:21:19,832
This is what they say.
This is what they are proud of.

1667
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:22,207
Okay, we're here at Habibi Ana.

1668
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:24,269
- Did I say that right?
- Yeah.

1669
01:21:24,312 --> 01:21:26,246
You guys, really...
I mean,

1670
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:28,215
gay Muslim activists,

1671
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:31,777
that is a very rare job description.
You guys have balls.

1672
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:35,150
How big is
the gay community...

1673
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:38,387
the gay Muslim community
here in Amsterdam?

1674
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:40,724
Or is this it?

1675
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:44,721
I mean, I'm guessing,
Thursday isn't...

1676
01:21:44,766 --> 01:21:47,462
isn't gay night here.

1677
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:50,062
I hope you guys find
each other attractive,

1678
01:21:50,105 --> 01:21:52,198
'cause otherwise...

1679
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:53,639
you don't feel afraid?

1680
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:55,074
Here in Holland I'm not,

1681
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:57,578
but when I came from my country,
I was very afraid.

1682
01:21:57,612 --> 01:21:58,909
There was an article of law:

1683
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:01,108
Punish the gay
for one year just because he's gay.

1684
01:22:01,149 --> 01:22:03,709
- Just being gay can get you a year.
- Just being gay.

1685
01:22:03,752 --> 01:22:05,310
Same as Alabama.

1686
01:22:06,755 --> 01:22:09,553
What I learned is that
they're not really...

1687
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:12,219
they're not specific
against homosexuality.

1688
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,820
They're not specific against,
in other words,

1689
01:22:14,863 --> 01:22:17,297
the desire
of a man for a man.

1690
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:20,824
What they are against
is specific behavior,

1691
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:22,632
like anal sex.

1692
01:22:22,671 --> 01:22:26,767
They don't say homosexuality,
heterosexuality.

1693
01:22:26,808 --> 01:22:29,606
They just don't want you doing it
in the naughty place,

1694
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:31,202
which I guess,

1695
01:22:31,246 --> 01:22:33,942
if you put that out
of the picture in homosexuality,

1696
01:22:33,982 --> 01:22:37,474
what do you have left?
Just the blowjob.

1697
01:22:39,354 --> 01:22:40,912
What do you think
when people say

1698
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,220
it affects your memory,

1699
01:22:43,258 --> 01:22:45,453
especially your
short-term memory?

1700
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:48,690
- It does.
- And what do you think when people say

1701
01:22:48,730 --> 01:22:52,166
that it affects your memory,
your short-term memory?

1702
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:53,997
It does.

1703
01:22:56,338 --> 01:22:59,796
- I like my hat.
- It's good. You look good, too.

1704
01:22:59,841 --> 01:23:01,968
I think I do.
I think I might adopt this look.

1705
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:02,999
Yes.

1706
01:23:03,044 --> 01:23:05,274
Is there a reason
why you have a black hat

1707
01:23:05,313 --> 01:23:06,837
and I have a white hat?

1708
01:23:06,881 --> 01:23:09,213
We have any color you like.

1709
01:23:09,250 --> 01:23:12,219
So I bought this.
I like it myself

1710
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:14,448
because I like the color.

1711
01:23:14,489 --> 01:23:18,289
There is a lot of tension
in the last five years or so.

1712
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:22,319
Is Islam a threat
to Dutch values?

1713
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:24,855
Islam is preaching,

1714
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:26,890
above all, peace.

1715
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:29,165
Peace, peace and peace.

1716
01:23:51,459 --> 01:23:53,859
The name Islam means peace.

1717
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:56,193
And yet it is involved
in a lot of war and violence.

1718
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:58,096
Yeah, it's just all politics.

1719
01:23:58,133 --> 01:23:59,998
- Nothing to do with religion?
- No no.

1720
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,662
- No?
- No, sir.

1721
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:03,671
- It's political.
- It's politics.

1722
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,502
Seems to be
a lot of passages

1723
01:24:05,540 --> 01:24:07,940
that say the infidel

1724
01:24:07,976 --> 01:24:11,275
is not the equal
of the believer.

1725
01:24:11,312 --> 01:24:13,371
The infidel will die in hell.

1726
01:24:13,415 --> 01:24:16,384
Don't feel bad
about hating the infidel.

1727
01:24:16,418 --> 01:24:19,546
- No.
- No?

1728
01:24:19,587 --> 01:24:21,578
Boy, I've got
bad information.

1729
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:22,885
Yes, you have.
I think so.

1730
01:24:22,924 --> 01:24:25,518
- No no no no no.
- No no no no.

1731
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:27,118
- No no no no.
- No.

1732
01:24:27,162 --> 01:24:29,790
No? No. I'm wrong
about everything.

1733
01:24:29,831 --> 01:24:33,562
The way I perceive things in the Koran
is not about killing infidels.

1734
01:24:33,601 --> 01:24:36,365
- But you have read it in there?
- Of course I've read the Koran.

1735
01:24:36,404 --> 01:24:39,237
You've read those passages, and what
did you think when you read them?

1736
01:24:39,274 --> 01:24:41,799
No, but I explain those
passages within the time

1737
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:43,936
in which they emerged
in the world.

1738
01:24:43,978 --> 01:24:45,468
That's not how people
read holy books.

1739
01:24:45,513 --> 01:24:47,105
People don't read
holy books and go,

1740
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:49,810
"Well, that was good for then."
People who read holy books and go,

1741
01:24:49,851 --> 01:24:52,012
"This is the word of God.
It's forever!"

1742
01:24:52,053 --> 01:24:54,954
- No, I don't agree.
- That's how most people do it.

1743
01:24:54,989 --> 01:24:57,583
I just don't buy it
that these guys are

1744
01:24:57,625 --> 01:24:59,889
in this state of denial.

1745
01:24:59,928 --> 01:25:02,624
I think they're just
in a state of denial

1746
01:25:02,664 --> 01:25:04,655
to an outsider.

1747
01:25:04,699 --> 01:25:07,429
They will not admit
anything is wrong

1748
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:10,165
with their culture
to an outsider.

1749
01:25:10,205 --> 01:25:12,298
Muslims were imperialists

1750
01:25:12,340 --> 01:25:15,070
in the century
after Mohammed's death.

1751
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:17,772
They conquered most
of the known world

1752
01:25:17,812 --> 01:25:19,507
in one century.

1753
01:25:19,547 --> 01:25:22,482
Yeah, it is possible.

1754
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:24,417
You call it conquer.

1755
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:26,181
I think they were trying

1756
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:29,190
to spread Islam.

1757
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:32,819
Well, they were, but they weren't doing
it by singing "Kumbaya."

1758
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:34,795
Excuse me.

1759
01:25:35,964 --> 01:25:37,659
Sorry.

1760
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:40,691
Oh, that 21st century's
always busting in.

1761
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:44,762
I'm going to shut it off.

1762
01:25:44,806 --> 01:25:48,765
I love it that he's got "Kashmir"
as his ringtone.

1763
01:25:53,515 --> 01:25:55,506
Okay, I shut it off.

1764
01:25:55,550 --> 01:25:57,848
- Sorry, I was...
- Yeah...

1765
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:00,910
Politics, okay.

1766
01:26:03,658 --> 01:26:06,650
Do you think it's possible
that when we're on something

1767
01:26:06,694 --> 01:26:08,525
like marijuana
or mushrooms

1768
01:26:08,563 --> 01:26:11,623
and believe we're having a very
spiritual experience,

1769
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:14,191
that we're just high?

1770
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:17,329
- It's... it's...
- Oh, look out your head's on fire!

1771
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:19,567
Boy, talk about
the light bulb going off,

1772
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:23,065
- that was your whole head.
- I don't like candles behind me.

1773
01:26:23,111 --> 01:26:26,308
No. Oh, look,
I found another joint.

1774
01:26:26,347 --> 01:26:28,338
Uh-oh.

1775
01:26:29,784 --> 01:26:32,218
Can we get closer?

1776
01:26:32,253 --> 01:26:35,381
That is one hell of a wall.

1777
01:26:51,606 --> 01:26:52,971
This is the Dome of the Rock?

1778
01:26:53,007 --> 01:26:56,101
This is the Dome of the Rock.
According to Islam...

1779
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:02,747
On a horse?

1780
01:27:09,891 --> 01:27:10,983
He went to heaven on the horse?

1781
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,459
Why is it holy for the Jews?

1782
01:27:37,752 --> 01:27:40,186
A rock. The Kaaba?

1783
01:27:40,221 --> 01:27:41,882
Isn't that...

1784
01:27:44,158 --> 01:27:45,682
Stone, rock, the same thing.

1785
01:27:47,295 --> 01:27:49,388
Why is that holy?

1786
01:27:52,467 --> 01:27:53,491
Paradise.

1787
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:57,265
Could the rock itself have been
what we know now to be like a meteor?

1788
01:28:00,842 --> 01:28:03,470
But does it make a difference
that we now understand

1789
01:28:03,511 --> 01:28:04,978
what a meteor is?

1790
01:28:06,281 --> 01:28:07,305
Yes, right.

1791
01:28:07,348 --> 01:28:08,975
Okay.

1792
01:28:09,017 --> 01:28:10,985
This is the Mount
of Olives.

1793
01:28:11,019 --> 01:28:14,250
A lot of Orthodox Jews want
to be buried here,

1794
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:16,689
'cause they believe that
when the Messiah comes,

1795
01:28:16,724 --> 01:28:18,817
he will raise them from
the dead and march them through

1796
01:28:18,860 --> 01:28:22,125
that golden gate
and onto the Temple Mount,

1797
01:28:22,163 --> 01:28:25,792
which is why the Muslims
have walled up the gate.

1798
01:28:25,833 --> 01:28:28,267
The better to keep out
the Jewish Messiah

1799
01:28:28,303 --> 01:28:30,703
and his kosher zombies
from getting in.

1800
01:28:30,738 --> 01:28:34,640
Although you'd think that
if you had the power to raise the dead,

1801
01:28:34,676 --> 01:28:36,974
you'd have the power
to jump a fence.

1802
01:28:39,247 --> 01:28:40,874
I thought I would not be allowed

1803
01:28:40,915 --> 01:28:43,475
to walk in a mosque.

1804
01:28:43,518 --> 01:28:44,985
I thought only someone of your faith

1805
01:28:45,019 --> 01:28:46,748
was allowed to do that.

1806
01:29:01,402 --> 01:29:03,427
Why is he angry?

1807
01:29:05,073 --> 01:29:06,665
They're angry that
you're talking to me?

1808
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:16,043
Women in your culture

1809
01:29:16,084 --> 01:29:18,552
seem not to be as equal

1810
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:20,952
to the man as they
are in our culture.

1811
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:24,050
Yes.

1812
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:28,294
I talked to a Muslim scholar today.

1813
01:29:28,329 --> 01:29:32,425
And he said that Mohammed
had a meeting here.

1814
01:29:40,775 --> 01:29:44,040
Mohammed never set his foot

1815
01:29:44,078 --> 01:29:47,411
on that Temple Mount,
not even one foot.

1816
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:50,076
Never ever.

1817
01:29:50,118 --> 01:29:53,713
He was never in the land
of Israel, that's a historical fact.

1818
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,765
I think even
I understand that.

1819
01:30:06,801 --> 01:30:10,532
Why can't the people
of the different faiths get along?

1820
01:30:10,571 --> 01:30:14,530
All three religions
consider the same site

1821
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:16,566
to be holy.

1822
01:30:18,413 --> 01:30:20,904
Is it not because it was
conquered many times?

1823
01:30:20,948 --> 01:30:24,941
- Yes.
- It was conquered first by King David,

1824
01:30:24,986 --> 01:30:26,954
and then later by
the armies coming out

1825
01:30:26,988 --> 01:30:29,821
of the Arabian Desert.

1826
01:30:29,857 --> 01:30:31,552
- It changed hands during the crusades.
- We had the Romans.

1827
01:30:31,592 --> 01:30:33,150
We had the Byzantines.
We had the Persians.

1828
01:30:36,964 --> 01:30:39,728
There's more than
one mosque in the world

1829
01:30:39,767 --> 01:30:42,668
that used to be a church,
and before that was a temple.

1830
01:30:42,703 --> 01:30:46,139
Because it's a lot easier
just to change the sign on the top

1831
01:30:46,174 --> 01:30:47,607
and say
"under new management"

1832
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:50,236
than it is to change
the whole building.

1833
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:52,246
I worked a lot
of comedy clubs in the '80s

1834
01:30:52,280 --> 01:30:55,147
that still had
the disco ball on the ceiling.

1835
01:30:55,183 --> 01:30:57,651
And in the '90s,
they became strip clubs

1836
01:30:57,685 --> 01:31:00,279
and now
they're a Starbucks.

1837
01:31:00,321 --> 01:31:04,280
I've come today to the village
of Cerne Abbas in Southern England

1838
01:31:04,325 --> 01:31:07,783
to show you something
completely different.

1839
01:31:07,829 --> 01:31:10,764
It's in the shape
of a giant naked man

1840
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:14,097
with a sizable erection...
well, sizable for England.

1841
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:15,625
Some people think
that this means

1842
01:31:15,670 --> 01:31:18,798
that there is a giant actually
buried under that hill.

1843
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,808
Others think it has something
to do with crop circles

1844
01:31:20,842 --> 01:31:23,902
or ancient space visitors
or Druids,

1845
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:25,913
but nobody really knows.

1846
01:31:25,947 --> 01:31:28,438
And that's what
I find fascinating about this,

1847
01:31:28,483 --> 01:31:31,111
is that it doesn't
really mean anything.

1848
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:33,950
The locals have been
maintaining it for centuries,

1849
01:31:33,988 --> 01:31:36,013
and they don't
really know why.

1850
01:31:36,057 --> 01:31:38,082
They just do it because
they've always done it,

1851
01:31:38,125 --> 01:31:40,320
and isn't that
religion for you?

1852
01:31:40,361 --> 01:31:43,660
Sometimes you kneel,
sometimes you fast

1853
01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:45,757
and sometimes
you go up on the hill

1854
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:48,860
and you cut the grass
around the giant space penis.

1855
01:31:48,903 --> 01:31:51,030
Do you believe,
as so many Christians do nowadays,

1856
01:31:51,072 --> 01:31:53,040
that the world will end?

1857
01:31:53,074 --> 01:31:56,066
I think we are in the end times.
There are many many signs.

1858
01:31:56,110 --> 01:31:58,510
The world as we know it
will come to an end.

1859
01:31:58,546 --> 01:32:00,013
And beyond that,

1860
01:32:00,047 --> 01:32:03,346
there will be the glorious
second coming of Jesus Christ.

1861
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:08,848
It seems peaceful,

1862
01:32:08,890 --> 01:32:12,121
but this is the very spot where
a lot of Christians believe

1863
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:13,854
life on earth will end.

1864
01:32:13,895 --> 01:32:16,329
The irony of religion
is that because

1865
01:32:16,364 --> 01:32:19,060
of its power to divert man

1866
01:32:19,100 --> 01:32:21,466
to destructive courses,

1867
01:32:21,502 --> 01:32:24,596
the world actually
could come to an end.

1868
01:32:24,639 --> 01:32:27,233
A lot of people
in this country believe

1869
01:32:27,275 --> 01:32:28,674
in end times.

1870
01:32:28,709 --> 01:32:31,337
There will be this great
reckoning, the Rapture.

1871
01:32:31,379 --> 01:32:34,109
- Do you believe that?
- I do.

1872
01:32:41,155 --> 01:32:43,715
But if you believe that the world is
gonna come to an end,

1873
01:32:43,758 --> 01:32:45,726
and perhaps any day now,

1874
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:48,422
does it not drain
one's motivation

1875
01:32:48,462 --> 01:32:50,896
to improve life on earth
while we're here?

1876
01:33:01,943 --> 01:33:04,605
The plain fact is,
religion must die

1877
01:33:04,645 --> 01:33:06,806
for mankind to live.

1878
01:33:06,847 --> 01:33:09,782
The hour is getting very late
to be able to indulge

1879
01:33:09,817 --> 01:33:13,446
in having key decisions made
by religious people,

1880
01:33:13,487 --> 01:33:16,615
by irrationalists, by those
who would steer the ship of state

1881
01:33:16,657 --> 01:33:19,626
not by a compass,
but by the equivalent

1882
01:33:19,660 --> 01:33:22,060
of reading the entrails
of a chicken.

1883
01:33:22,096 --> 01:33:24,428
George Bush prayed
a lot about Iraq,

1884
01:33:24,465 --> 01:33:26,296
but he didn't learn
a lot about it.

1885
01:33:26,334 --> 01:33:27,801
I don't know that much
about politics,

1886
01:33:27,835 --> 01:33:29,427
I'll vote for President Bush
because of his faith.

1887
01:33:29,470 --> 01:33:33,736
Faith means making
a virtue out of not thinking.

1888
01:33:33,774 --> 01:33:35,401
It's nothing to brag about.

1889
01:33:35,443 --> 01:33:38,276
And those who preach faith
and enable and elevate it

1890
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:40,940
are our intellectual slaveholders,

1891
01:33:40,982 --> 01:33:43,280
keeping mankind in a bondage

1892
01:33:43,317 --> 01:33:45,308
to fantasy and nonsense

1893
01:33:45,353 --> 01:33:47,150
that has spawned and justified

1894
01:33:47,188 --> 01:33:50,316
so much lunacy and destruction.

1895
01:33:50,358 --> 01:33:53,657
Religion is dangerous
because it allows human beings

1896
01:33:53,694 --> 01:33:55,161
who don't have all the answers

1897
01:33:55,196 --> 01:33:57,255
to think that they do.

1898
01:33:57,298 --> 01:33:59,266
Most people would think
it's wonderful when someone says,

1899
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,497
"I'm willing, Lord.
I'll do whatever You want me to do."

1900
01:34:02,536 --> 01:34:06,632
Except that since there
are no gods actually talking to us,

1901
01:34:06,674 --> 01:34:10,303
that void is filled in by people
with their own corruptions,

1902
01:34:10,344 --> 01:34:13,836
- limitations and agendas.
- It's going to happen,

1903
01:34:13,881 --> 01:34:15,906
and I'm not saying
necessarily nuclear...

1904
01:34:15,950 --> 01:34:17,315
The Lord didn't say nuclear...

1905
01:34:17,351 --> 01:34:19,512
but I do believe it'll
be something like that.

1906
01:34:19,553 --> 01:34:21,282
And anyone who tells you
they know...

1907
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:24,314
they just know
what happens when you die,

1908
01:34:24,358 --> 01:34:26,258
I promise you, you don't.

1909
01:34:26,293 --> 01:34:29,626
How can I be so sure?
Because I don't know,

1910
01:34:29,664 --> 01:34:32,861
and you do not possess
mental powers that I do not.

1911
01:34:32,900 --> 01:34:35,494
The only appropriate attitude
for man to have

1912
01:34:35,536 --> 01:34:38,004
about the big questions

1913
01:34:38,039 --> 01:34:40,405
is not the arrogant certitude

1914
01:34:40,441 --> 01:34:42,466
that is the hallmark of religion,

1915
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:45,479
but doubt. Doubt is humble,

1916
01:34:45,513 --> 01:34:47,344
and that's what
man needs to be,

1917
01:34:47,381 --> 01:34:51,044
considering that human history
is just a litany

1918
01:34:51,085 --> 01:34:54,077
of getting shit dead wrong.

1919
01:34:54,121 --> 01:34:56,589
Jesus is coming back
to rescue the Jews,

1920
01:34:56,624 --> 01:34:59,024
because he is
the only one that can.

1921
01:34:59,060 --> 01:35:01,528
The believer goes in the paradise.

1922
01:35:01,562 --> 01:35:04,895
Unbeliever, they will go to hell.

1923
01:35:04,932 --> 01:35:08,265
The Jews are the only reason
that I am a Christian.

1924
01:35:08,302 --> 01:35:10,395
- I love them.
- But you're not gonna take them

1925
01:35:10,438 --> 01:35:13,032
- to heaven with you, are you?
- I'm gonna go in the Rapture,

1926
01:35:13,074 --> 01:35:15,872
and I'm gonna come back
on a white horse.

1927
01:35:26,053 --> 01:35:29,079
So you think Jesus
will end this earth at some point,

1928
01:35:29,123 --> 01:35:30,750
maybe in your lifetime?

1929
01:35:30,791 --> 01:35:32,759
One always hopes.
This is a sign, and that is a sign.

1930
01:35:32,793 --> 01:35:34,886
If a nuclear bomb went off,

1931
01:35:34,929 --> 01:35:37,762
and it seemed like that was
exactly what it had said,

1932
01:35:37,798 --> 01:35:40,266
balls of fire or something,

1933
01:35:40,301 --> 01:35:42,235
you wouldn't look on that
as necessarily a bad thing.

1934
01:35:42,269 --> 01:35:43,896
I know I'll be with God.

1935
01:35:43,938 --> 01:35:45,906
This is why rational people,

1936
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:47,567
anti-religionists,

1937
01:35:47,608 --> 01:35:49,576
must end their timidity
and come out of the closet

1938
01:35:49,610 --> 01:35:51,407
and assert themselves.

1939
01:35:51,445 --> 01:35:54,642
And those who consider themselves
only moderately religious

1940
01:35:54,682 --> 01:35:56,741
really need to look
in the mirror and realize

1941
01:35:56,784 --> 01:35:59,378
that the solace and comfort
that religion brings you

1942
01:35:59,420 --> 01:36:02,218
actually comes
at a terrible price.

1943
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:05,282
It says in the last days
there'll be wars, rumors of wars.

1944
01:36:05,326 --> 01:36:07,556
The Bible prophesies
from the Book of Revelation...

1945
01:36:07,595 --> 01:36:09,586
they're going to be fulfilled!

1946
01:36:09,630 --> 01:36:11,598
Can this be accomplished
without violence?

1947
01:36:11,632 --> 01:36:14,795
- No.
- Islam ruling the world,

1948
01:36:14,835 --> 01:36:16,132
global jihad.

1949
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:17,762
- Who will win out?
- We'll win.

1950
01:36:17,805 --> 01:36:20,069
That's for God to decide
on Judgment Day.

1951
01:36:29,950 --> 01:36:33,181
If you belonged to a political
party or a social club

1952
01:36:33,220 --> 01:36:36,587
that was tied
to as much bigotry, misogyny,

1953
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:38,353
homophobia, violence

1954
01:36:38,392 --> 01:36:40,622
and sheer ignorance
as religion is,

1955
01:36:40,661 --> 01:36:42,219
you'd resign in protest.

1956
01:36:42,263 --> 01:36:44,697
To do otherwise is
to be an enabler,

1957
01:36:44,732 --> 01:36:46,529
a Mafia wife,

1958
01:36:46,567 --> 01:36:49,297
with the true devils of extremism

1959
01:36:49,336 --> 01:36:50,769
that draw their legitimacy

1960
01:36:50,805 --> 01:36:53,171
from the billions
of their fellow travelers.

1961
01:36:53,207 --> 01:36:56,870
If the world does come
to an end here or wherever,

1962
01:36:56,911 --> 01:37:00,005
or if it limps into the future,
decimated by the effects

1963
01:37:00,047 --> 01:37:03,107
of a religion-inspired
nuclear terrorism,

1964
01:37:03,150 --> 01:37:05,311
let's remember
what the real problem was:

1965
01:37:05,352 --> 01:37:08,480
That we learned how
to precipitate mass death

1966
01:37:08,522 --> 01:37:11,355
before we got past
the neurological disorder

1967
01:37:11,392 --> 01:37:13,758
of wishing for it.

1968
01:37:13,794 --> 01:37:17,525
That's it. Grow up or die.

1969
01:37:19,834 --> 01:37:23,793
We are in a conflict
between good and evil.

1970
01:40:45,873 --> 01:40:48,433
See you in heaven.

1971
01:40:48,475 --> 01:40:50,102
Who knows?

1972
01:40:51,512 --> 01:40:53,480
Yeah, exactly.

1973
01:40:58,481 --> 01:40:59,481
