Huma Hatun, healthy male child was born Lord.

16
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,960 
Out of respect for our prophet, his name Mehmet.

17
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:06,480 
The name I gave him, let God decide his fate.

I told you that there will ever beat you Hassan.

00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,400 
And I've told you that this will be my happiest day.

21
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:24,200 
Received a letter from Khalil Pasha of Adrianople.

22
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,520 
<i> Mehmet was more like 12 years mount the throne. </ i></i>

23
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:01,160 
<i> Due to the political struggle between the viziers and beys,</i>

26
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:20,800 
But <i> Chief Vizier Halil Pasha, concerns that the Crusaders</i>
will take in the Ottoman lands, Murad II returned to power. </ i>

27
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,560 
<i> Mehmed was removed from the throne and was sent to Saruhan Sanjak. </ i></i>

28
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:14,680 
He had strong hands, capturing cities, armies crush ...

29
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,040 
Not one time did not showered me.

30
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:26,560 
He had a keen eye, he saw the future of the state.

31
00:07:29,920 --> 00:06:36,000 
Not once, not looked at me with love.

32
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:42,720 
How much I loved you never saw.

33
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:50,440 
My heart beats to kiss the ground on which it was based.

34
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:57,840 
From that day on, my heart will beat to take over
land on which you could not set foot Dad!

35
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:03,120 
To find out great country!

36
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,200 
Why did not my father viziers are far from me?

37
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:39,480 
Worthy of your status, stand by me.

38
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,440 
After five years, I returned to the throne deserved.

39
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:51,720 
What do you say, Halil Pasha?

40
00:08:51,840 --> 00:09:03,880 
Then, you were very young Lord. Crusaders
had crossed the Danube to expel us from Rumelia.

41
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,440 
We asked your father to return to the throne.

42
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,760 
Whatever we did was for the state.

43
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:23,160 
If you think we made a mistake, our life is yours.

44
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:38,880 
I believe so, for the good of the country they proclaim
as chief vizier.

45
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:50,920 
Shahabettin, Zaurus and Saradzha Viziers will be too.

46
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,840 
<i> CONSTANTINOPLE </ i></i>

47
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:28,000 
Murat Bey died Supreme Emperor!
Sultan Mehmed, the second time was on the throne.

48
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,800 
I see that as me and you make you happy
this news.

49
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,800 
I'm not happy emperor.

50
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,880 
Grand Duke is afraid that her son and his father will
tried to besiege our city, as I understand.

51
00:10:54,040 --> 00:11:00,000 
Remember why Murat Bey gave up the siege last time.

52
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:08,360 
That proclaim him as the Sultan is very even.
Pathetic successor.

53
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:15,760 
Now we have a strong candidate for the Sultan
shehzade (Prince) Orhan.

54
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:22,680 
Excuse me, but that dreams are meaningless.

55
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,680 
The only desire is to Sultan Mehmed
destroy our empire.

56
00:11:28,920 --> 00:08:32,120 
To get into town, he studied
engineering sciences.

57
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:38,240 
To understand our weak traits learn our language.
Also religion.

58
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,680 
It may be young but he is antichrist himself!

59
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:52,400 
Grand Duke Notares, stop worrying.
Mehmed was deposed before.

60
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,760 
His reputation among the people is low.

61
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:01,200 
Prior to his throne rejoice not, will
show him his power, not fear.

62
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:08,960 
Send Envoy to consult Odrin.Mehmed
our peaceful policy.

63
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:25,400 
Do not be older by all!
Learning-Sultan to hold a sword and you don 'was reflected Hasan!

64
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,800 
Come and sit down.

65
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:39,920 
I'm afraid of you know, what government?
Who will teach him?

66
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000 
Vladetelstvoto is in the soul, or has it or not.

67
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:54,120 
Murat Bay, this was it? In Varna, in Kosovo
we are together.

68
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:59,000 
For it is not an eye, a thousand eyes if I could I would give!

69
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:05,320 
A Mehmed .... Do so, Master!
He was only 12 when I mount the throne.

70
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:15,600 
Nobody cares. Go, toppled him?
They took it. Everybody knows that.

71
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:23,400 
In its place if the doll came to Byzantium,
Orhan traitor, happier you would be?

72
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:32,080 
Without knowing it, talking.
Someday I will be ashamed of those words.

73
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:54,000 
Sultan Mehmed is determined to finish, what his father failed.

74
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:04,280 
His next goal is Rom. doubt this.

75
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:15,280 
Emperor Constantine must accept the agreement adopted in Florence
to join the church.

76
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,040 
Thus, if we need to do, and pressure.

77
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:24,320 
True is, from these faithless Turks, a greater threat may not have.

78
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,240 
You can use bezopitnostta Mehmed to get rid
forever by the Ottomans.

79
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:40,160 
Constantinople is a Muslim or capital, or Catholic.

80
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:50,000 
I do not think that Mehmet is smarter or bolder than his father.
But we must consider all possibilities.

81
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:55,480 
We can not leave Constantinople to the faithless!

82
00:14:55,560 --> 00:15:01,400 
God is on our side.

83
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:15,960 
You're right, made chief Vizier Halil Pasha.
Not even the power to evict the man who ousted him.

84
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:19,600 
We must take advantage of this Ilyaz Bay.
To send news to others.

85
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,960 
Time to get rid of the Ottomans.

86
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:52,600 
Thanks for the nice words Imprerator Constantine, for my father.

87
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:59,680 
And Orhan ...

88
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:12,160 
Emperor you want to increase payments to Orhan 300,000.

89
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:19,440 
For us it is important to live in a reputable environment.

90
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:29,280 
We will release an order. Tell Impratora you
that his desire friendship will be accepted by us.

91
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,160 
Do you believe in the sincerity of Constantine?

92
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,160 
Can not exceed either the strength or courage, Lord.

93
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:58,880 
Contact Latin, Hungarian and Serbian rulers also with the Pope.

94
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:03,280 
Tell them that and they want to live in peace.

95
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,160 
As you wish Lord.

96
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,360 
You are free.

97
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:14,120 
Zanos Shaadettin and grazing, you stay.

98
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:19,840 
I see that the decisions that I made you disappointed.

99
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:24,440 
We should question the decisions of the Sultan.

100
00:17:25,160 --> 00:12:32,520 
But before you issued the command, if you ask our opinion.
Then we'll say the words.

101
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:39,240 
For the future of our country, there is no greater purpose than
conquest of Constantinople.

102
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:47,280 
Before you eliminate your way to victory, we must be patient.

103
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:04,840 
Mother, I miss my father.

104
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:10,960 
Not his father, Sultan. How do you say?
My sultan.
105
00:18:16,000 -> 00:18:21,524
Sultan, I know that in everything you do has a wisdom.

105
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:30,040 
To ascend again Khalil Pasha as chief vizier and relationships
Byzantium created disappointment among the people.

106
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,120 
They give it as a vulnerability.

107
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:39,200 
I'm concerned, if not win the confidence of the army and the people

108
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:42,120 
If you do not feel under your power, we can have big problems.

109
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:48,480 
Power is not a demonstration of power to the people Zanos.

110
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:59,160 
To protecting the interests of the people, prosperity
and build their future.

111
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:02,200 
And that's what makes a great Sultan.

112
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:12,640 
Do not worry, its time and my people and
my army will understand why I have decided that now.

113
00:19:17,640 --> 00:19:20,680 
Checkmate.

114
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,560 
Welcome, Gulbahar Hatun.

115
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:23,240 
It was a long journey, Lord.

116
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:27,520 
But you see, it was worth.

117
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:32,040 
Yes, Dad!
My sultan!

118
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,160 
Lack many of your son shehzade Bayazat.

119
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,120 
Even in their dreams repeat your name.

120
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:49,640 
Go to rest.

121
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:10,840 
<i> Port of Genoa, Italy </ i></i>

122
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:42,360 
Age!

123
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,040 
Not least I would have missed.

124
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:50,160 
I saw time with the File Type duke, but I could not convince him.

125
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,680 
Not at all interested in your sketches, unfortunately.

126
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,520 
I expected it.

127
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,600 
He told me if your father accepted you will immediately open a workshop.

128
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:05,000 
You know my father will not accept it.

129
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,040 
I know. I said the Duke.

130
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,800 
Thank you for everything. I owe you.
Goodbye.

131
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,640 
Age! Stay here!

132
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,600 
Marry me.

133
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:28,200 
We will bring your father. And the duke will convince him of the time.

134
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,200 
Even going to help your father to open a shop.

135
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:39,000 
And before I tell you. To me will always stay
as a valuable friend.

136
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,960 
And could not sleep.

137
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,440 
Why not asleep, son?

138
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,840 
Sultans do not you love the kids, Mom?

139
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:42,360 
What? As you grow you will see,
how much they love you.

140
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:46,160 
My son!

141
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,080 
Mehmed!

142

I am Osman. Turkish beylik found, those who came after me.

143
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,120 
Grandparents thy father, made it a huge country.

144
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:26,080 
You're the man who will turn this country
a strong Empire Mehmed.

145
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:37,080 
This ring most you deserve it.

146
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:42,960 
Foreshadowed by our great prophet Conqueror Mehmed you!

147
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,440 
Be blessed!

148
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:32,320 
Sultan of mine! Are you okay?

149
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:39,720 
Or I'll take Constantinople, or he me!

Issa Pasha command of the yard in Gelibolu make
one hundred ships a year.

151

Immediately, my Lord.

00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:06,760 
Khalil Pasha, I extended report enicherskiya weapons status.
-Commanded.

153
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:13,640 
If you allow, what is this?

154
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:22,080 
To join Anatolia to Rumelia and creating
of a vast empire Khalil Pasha.

155
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:29,000 
I understand the hint, but I fear that we want to expand,
we can also disappear.

156
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:37,080 
To stay in one place is like death to my people
must take bold decisions.

157
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:45,800 
The teacher taught me something once,
"To write history is not for cowards."

158
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:09,920 
Leave it in place! Stay not run!
Get him!
160
00:27:14,000 -> 00:27:18,900
Many apologies.

159
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,480 
Where is the boy?

160
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:32,640 
Where is the bastard?

161
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:38,480 
Let's run!

162
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:13,720 
How was your trip?
Without you, it was nice.

163
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:16,240 
But it was not bad.

164
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,800 
There was a storm at one time.
-Really?

165
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,200 
I found the book you wanted.

166
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,200 
Tell what Duke said?

167
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,440 
Not interested in sketches our Dad.

168
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:41,120 
Not understand their value.

169
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:45,120 
He wants to pouring piece for his army.

170
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:50,720 
Just go to hell! Do not know that anyone
weapons will not do more?

171
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:59,720 
Well how Justinian, what?

172
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,040 
One thing, however I ask your hand.

173
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:09,040 
And you refused him again right?

174
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:34,840 
Constantine gives Orhan dinner tonight after dinner
to see.

175
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,040 
For our Turkish friends!

176
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:59,160 
Karamanoglu Ibrahim was in preparation for war with Sultan Mehmed.

177
00:29:59,200 --> 00:18:36,120 
If there is strong support, who do you think will win,
Shehzade Orhan?

178
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,040 
Naturally Karamanoglu.

179
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,160 
You do not just know we all think so.

180
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,840 
To sit on his throne hereditary, you should only
one thing.

181
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,560 
Helping Karamanoglu Ibrahim Bey.

182
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,000 
I'm ready for anything!

183
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:35,080 
Write a letter to Karamanoglu that we, Hungarians, Latins, the pope
are on his side.

184
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,960 
You promise to his land.

185
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:46,480 
If you do this, I will take responsibility
to send them the letter.

186
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:51,840 
And the rest will sit down and watch with pleasure.

187
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:38,160 
The letter written by Orhan for Karamanoglu, my Sultan.

188
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:48,800 
Bravo!
-Suppose that the second group delegates already arrived to Karamanoglu.

189
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:18,880 
Our plan worked, Karamanoglu Ibrahim started the uprising.

190
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:24,000 
The trap we fell. If Karamanoglu beat is sarsheno
with him.

191
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:31,720 
It is not important whether you win, what matters is the army of Murad
losing positions. And you can not resist us.

192
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,760 
It will also double money for Orhan
of 600,000.

193
00:33:38,760 --> 00:33:42,880 
You also will accept.

194
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:51,240 
By increasing my treasury, no reputation
will completely evaporate.

195
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,240 
<i> Beystvo Karamanoglu</i>
Akshehir 1451g. </ I>

196
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:12,760 
You Halil Pasha was on our side?
Without his help, it is not possible to collect such an army!

197
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:19,440 
The letter was a big lie deceived us.
-If we fight, victory is impossible.

198
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:30,880 
Karamanoglu Ibrahim, wanted peace!
If we now leave it as soon as possible, it will be refunded!

199
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:39,920 
A country can not afford, if we fight with someone who wants peace
our army will endure serious damage.

200
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,920 
Accept the proposal from Lord!

201
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,560 
Nonsense! Your political understanding is based
a cowardly act!

202
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:52,800 
And I'm on the side of the Vizier, I think you will not find
courage to recover soon.

203
00:34:52,960 --> 00:34:57,800 
When marshirovame to Constantinople, it will not be an obstacle.

204
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:02,600 
Go! Send this hypocrite here.

205
00:34:09,640 --> 00:35:12,520 
Take it inside.

206
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,080 
Stand up.

207
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:39,360 
Do not Forget!
War with everyone, but peace with decent people do!

208
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:47,120 
I swear on my pride while I'm alive
will not shed blood between us!

209
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:55,200 
I swear on the pride that will carry
the end of his days.

210
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:05,360 
Or your death will be my hands.
Who knows? Maybe your destiny is one.

211
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:27,960 
My Sultan!
-Read.

212
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:43,080 
Constantine wants to double the money
we pay for Orhan, Lord.

213
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:53,160 
There is no reason to do this.
But neither the place nor the time!

214
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:02,800 
He wants to take advantage of our campaign!

215
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:08,840 
Get out!
Lala (gl.vezir) you stay.

216
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:17,160 
You also friendly behavior, otherwise attributed to him?

217
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,000 
You neither strength nor courage lack?

218
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:27,840 
Is that what you understand by friendship Lala?
Is this?

219
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,560 
Come here!

220
00:37:42,000 --> 00:35:50,360 
Before the march fell into my hands a letter to Orhan
Ibrahim, read!

221
00:37:50,920 --> 00:38:03,960 
I am surprised by the sentence to Orhan Ibrahim.
"Chief Vizier Halil Pasha was also with me."

222
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:09,640 
But for now, must keep it secret.

223
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:17,960 
Allah is my witness! I have nothing to do with it!

224
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:26,000 
Throughout his life, no moment is not separated
the way your father and you.

225
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:37,280 
In return we'll talk in Edirne
more seriously in this tema.Svoboden her.

226
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,000 
<i> With this letter, Mehmed Pasha, Halil pressed. </ i></i>

227
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:45,520 
<i> wanted to remove his power over the Janissaries. </ i></i>

228
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,280

231
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:10,840 
These dvulichnitsi send them into exile.
As Lord-favored combination.

232
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:17,880 
Every blow they receive is actually for me.

233
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:26,080 
Karamanoglu was! Cowards! Surrendered without a fight.

234
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:31,120 
Sultan Mehmed saw that we mirolyubivostta fraud.

235
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:38,280 
It is no longer young. He won his first campaign.

236
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:47,600 
Be sure not to send even half
the money for Orhan.

237
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:06,480 
Why still vainly blame?

238
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:10,160 
How can you write such a letter?

239
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:14,040 
With what audacity using my name?

240
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,440 
I am sure that the Sultan was aware of the lie.
Even if not, can not hurt.

241
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:26,040 
You can not afford internal problems in the state.

242
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:33,320 
Emine wrong, the state step by step, passing
in his hands.

243
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,240 
Sultan Pasha has called you!

244
00:40:36,280 --> 00:40:39,320 
Allah! At that time?

245
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:45,640 
This tradition in our state has one explanation.

246
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:49,120 
Go, fetch my shroud.

247
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:59,000 
Prayer, I am a witness that no god but Allah,
I witness that no other prophet than Mohammed.

248
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,160 
Walk.

249
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,280 
Give him water.

250
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:40,600 
I never doubted your loyalty.
If it were otherwise, I would take your head.

251
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:50,800 
Surrender of Constantine, they would no longer pay.

252
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:55,000 
As you wish Lord.

253
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:02,720 
Come here.

254
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:14,840 
What do you see?
-This is a fort built by Sultan Bayazid.

255
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:24,360 
Now what you see?
New Fort in Rumelia Lord.

256
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:32,280 
Right here we will build the new fort.
These two towers, your people will build.

257
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:43,720 
The first stone, the Byzantines, the Pope and all other
will understand what we want to do Lord.

258
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:47,960 
Will join and will attack us.

259
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:56,760 
Neither Latins nor pope, nor Constantine ...

260
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:05,600 
I only think, for my people,
who does not see opportunities like conquer Constantinople.

261
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:21,000 
Not ever going to shed blood, but whether it will be martyred,
or vain? This is the question.

262
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:33,400 
<i> Boazkesen</i>
April 1452g. </ I>

263
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:07,520 
Our Sultan! (Peaceful)

264
00:44:10,120 --> 00:44:14,280 
Work!

265
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:23,480 
Came to our noses and build a fort!
-You break the ships of the Black Sea.

266
00:44:24,120 --> 00:44:28,200 
We'll make you starve!
-Prepare for attack.

267
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:34,280 
We need to prepare for war.

268
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:40,720 
Tell my brothers. Collect armies
and to come here.

269
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:47,920 
Tell Justinian if commanding my army
will receive the island of Limnos.

270
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,720 
What was the name of the master piece?
Urban-Lord.

271
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,640 
Make him finally to make cannons for us!

272
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:14,120 
You were right by building this fort, intentions
Sultan Mehmed clarified.

273
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:22,240 
The Pope should take action if we collect
strong army of crusaders, Mehmed will abandon the attack.

274
00:45:22,360 --> 00:45:30,600 
So Constantine will sign the contract
for not joining the Orthodox Church to the Vatican.

275
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:38,520 
But Frenchmen and Englishmen were at war,
Their armies are worse condition.

276
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,560 
A German Emperor has internal problems to the throne.

277
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:47,680 
Sultan Mehmed knows it all.
Planned on it that is

278
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:52,200 
Yes, but the pope could convince the Venetians.

279
00:45:52,360 --> 00:45:59,080 
To send a messenger to Constantine.
-Right. Needs to know about our efforts.

280
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:06,760 
Sultan mine, to 11 months will build a fort.
-You have five months.

281
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:13,440 
To prevent aid to Constantinople
have to take under control the Bosphorus.

282
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:17,680 
If you all will carry stones.

283
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:26,720 
Just as expected, Constantine sought help
from his brothers.

284
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:38,000 
Sad but I see that you want to disconnect my
the Black Sea, will prevent our trade!

285
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:42,680 
Your destination is more than clear.

286
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:46,280 
Think you can skip my walls.

287
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,000 
As your father and you will be dissatisfied.

288
00:46:53,920 --> 00:47:00,880 
Something that has nothing to do with us because of a letter
written without our knowledge ...

289
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:05,120 
you stopped the money you pay for Orhan.

290
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:18,560 
To continue the peaceful days between us, we did not
opposed to this.

291
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:24,240 
But if you do not immediately stop the construction, I will send Orhan
in Edirne ...

292
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:29,240 
I'll do anything to him the throne!

293
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:42,960 
Also, if you think that the pope and the Latins
will tolerate this, you're wrong.

294
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:48,720 
Meet the largest army of crusaders in history!

295
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,200 
He would raise Orhan.

296
00:47:54,320 --> 00:48:03,200 
To stop the intrigues that spanned centuries.
My people and the army are with me, he knows it.

297
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:08,280 
The pope was to gather an army to collect
to see.

298
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:14,560 
We beat them in Varna and Kosovo
I will beat them.

299
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:20,440 
I, I do not look like Sultans before me.

300
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:24,360 
I am the Sultan Mehmed Khan.

301
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:29,880 
This is my land and this will make a fort!

302
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:36,840 
Everything is my land,
is under my power!

303
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:39,680 
<i> Mora </ i></i>

304
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:29,360 
I will not stop building?
-Collected a large army.

305
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,960 
I will burn him and his army.

306
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:37,640 
The pope promised military aid.

307
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,440 
But they want the union of our church.

308
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:46,240 
Why not send Orhan in Edirne?
To provoke the anger of people against Mehmed.

309
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,440 
This is impossible, all with Mehmed

310
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:54,880 
Then why keep Orhan here?
-Mehmet will not break our walls.

311
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:59,240 
The last day will f
And then we'll need Orhan.

312
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:05,240 
Cannons prepare you?
Renewal-end, Emperor.

313
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,600 
Welcome!
-Thank you.

314
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:20,720 
Dad and salt to take.
Well-daughter.

315
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,960 
Urban Master!
Grand Duke Notarez you cried.

316
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:29,120 
Dad?
You go home, my daughter, do not worry.

317
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,880 
Welcome to Urban Master!

318
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:44,440 
As you know, our city is preparing for war.

319
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,480 
This is not my war.

320
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:53,720 
All Christians need to perform their duty.
And you so!

321
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,560 
I have neither the strength nor the desire to pour guns.
Excuse me.

322
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:04,760 
Think about your beautiful daughter
nobody wants it to happen!

323
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:10,320 
By morning you have time to change your mind.
Now go away.

324
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:19,800 
Hurry! Before placing dogs Notarez,
gotta move on.

325
00:52:26,840 --> 00:52:31,040 
Are detained under the direction of Grand Duke Notarez!
Get him!

326
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,640 
Stop! Stop!

327
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:40,880 
Leave my daughter!
-Get your hands dirty!

328
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:30,200 
Sultan Mehmed wanted to see
Master in Urban palace.

329
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:44,360 
We learned that the Turks were kidnapped Urban.
-Will make his guns and will destroy our walls.

330
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:48,680 
Find a way to kill Urban.

331
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:52,360 
Came news of your brethren great emperors.

332
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:58,680 
Mehmed forces have destroyed their end.

333
00:53:58,840 --> 00:54:05,120 
Their armies were defeated!

334
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,200 
Unfit Turk!
Always one step ahead of me!

335
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:21,840 
Sorry to forcibly make you come
to Edirne.

336
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:26,240 
Actually, you did a great kindness to us.

337
00:54:27,440 --> 00:54:32,000 
To help you Sultana will close
one of my old account.

338
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:34,880 
What account?

339
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:41,960 
Years ago, krastinostsite supported by Constantine.
The campaign to expel you from the Balkans ...

340
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:47,040 
Destroyed all Muslim villages on their way.

341
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:53,000 
One of them was our village.

342
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:44,680 
Killed my whole family.

343
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:52,400 
I woke up in the slave market in Constantinople.

344
00:56:02,920 --> 00:56:09,280 
If Urban was not bought me ...
-It is not your father right?

345
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,840 
As my father is,

346
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:16,280 
Since that day, he is the father.

347
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:22,800 
Come start leem cannon.

348
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:26,720 
I'm good as my father.

349
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:35,520 
Girl in the arms factory?
-Do not worry, nobody will ever know.

350
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,520 
Let's go, come on Dad.

351
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:52,160 
We did not stay another choice.

352
00:56:55,240 --> 00:57:03,280 
Write a letter to the pope, I am ready to do
common ritual between Catholics and Orthodox.

353
00:57:03,320 --> 00:57:10,840 
We must unite and to fight
our biggest enemy, the Antichrist.

354
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:16,440 
If you call them will be gone from our town!

355
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:23,880 
Did you forget our past!? Will also damaging to the faith
us and our city.

356
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,800 
Mehmed, in the near future we will attack
no time to lose!

357
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:34,280 
I beg your Great Emperor!
This decision will give our church the Pope!

358
00:57:34,840 --> 00:57:36,240 
This would be the end of our religion!

359
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:44,560 
I prefer the Turks than Latin.

360
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:50,960 
We do not want to see false Catholics
The Hagia Sophia!

361
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:54,080 
I will not betray their religion in the hands of the Pope!

362
00:57:54,080 --> 00:57:58,840 
I will not pray with them!
-Do not want to "St. Sofia"!

363
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:03,280 
They want to take our faith!

364
00:58:03,320 --> 00:58:10,080 
Time to say stop the Catholics,
that feed on our blood!

365
00:58:55,760 --> 00:59:00,360 
Master Urban, I am glad to see you
wizard and you to me.

366
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:02,960 
Bladodarya you.

367
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:09,160 
I want to pouring huge cannon which will in
history, vouchsafed to break the walls of Constantinople!

368
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:17,480 
As you wish.
-Hassan will always be with you, for your security needs.

369
00:59:18,200 --> 00:59:23,200 
Do you easily.
-Thank you.

370
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:32,280 
Lord! Bless our work, we were not ashamed!.

371
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:38,120 
Bless our victorious army!
-Amen.

372
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:54,640 
Prayer "Strength and power can only be achieved through
the great and supreme God "

373
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:58,880 
Allah is great!
-God is great!

374
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:17,080 
Do you need help Ilyaz master?
-What?

375
01:00:17,120 --> 01:00:21,200 
Among this crowd of men, we
they can call Age.

376
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,080 
Close your mouth!
Not only do I look like a boy!

377
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:29,480 
Beautiful as it was in its market
I think.

378
01:00:34,040 --> 01:00:25,920 
<i> Boazkesen,</i>
September 1452g. </ I>

379
01:00:38,080 --> 01:00:42,640 
The Turks have created a miracle.
Look, this is a sign to stop!

380
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:52,240 
That they want does not mean that we stop!

381
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,000 
Dive!

382
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,120 
<i> County Genoa </ i></i>

383
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:09,520 
How will my ship sink?
-Prepare to besiege Constantinople.

384
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:14,480 
It interferes with our trade,
also fought with us!

385
01:01:16,680 --> 01:01:19,880 
We can not afford direct combat.

386
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:28,840 
I can go and army commander Constantine.

387
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:34,880 
Brace yourself now!
-As you wish, my Lord.

388
01:01:39,040 --> 01:01:46,560 
It was to be close Black
commercial time to think of to help.

389
01:01:50,160 --> 01:02:02,480 
And you, dear priyateli.Vyarvam that
will be able to unite Catholics and Orthodox.

390
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:10,480 
If you what I can find the strength to
save the city.

391
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:15,760 
I will send a large detachment of archers with you
in Constantinople.

392
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:22,120 
To achieve his goal, people
have to believe in you.

393
01:02:25,960 --> 01:02:31,880 
God bless you.

394
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:55,080 
As I decided to pour gun again
shy that I can not do it.

395
01:02:55,440 --> 01:03:01,960 
But now ... Well that convinced me daughter.
-I know you do it for me daddy.

396
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:08,240 
I looked again to the drawings.
Well, Dad.

397
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:24,160 
I am grateful to His Excellency.

398
01:03:24,360 --> 01:03:29,600 
Your presence has helped morale of the people
and strength of my army.

399
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:33,440 
The truth is that you need more help
Emperor.

400
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:41,480 
If you want help from Catholics for the godless Turks
know what to do.

401
01:03:42,040 --> 01:03:52,160 
For a long time by repeating insistently
The Pope is to join the Orthodox to the Vatican.

402
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:01,600 
To silence Genadeus would not be
problem for the powerful emperor as yours.

403
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:05,320 
We will do whatever it takes.

404
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:13,200 
My people! Emperor who sold his soul
The Pope, how will keep our faith?

405
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:21,480 
He fell on his knees before the Pope and
sell our religion!

406
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:28,120 
Not our tradition, and Catholic action
to pray.

407
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:35,120 
They want to rule the Orthodox!

408
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:38,320 
They will let you do that?
-No ...

409
01:04:55,440 --> 01:05:00,000 
Think again about this decision, my Sultan.

410
01:05:00,080 --> 01:05:04,320 
We know that the Pope has sent a detachment of archers.

411
01:05:05,000 --> 01:05:09,640 
Armies will come from Venice and Genoa.

412
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:16,560 
German, English and French soldiers will come with
security.

413
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:22,240 
Englishmen and Frenchmen almost destroyed his army.

414
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:27,000 
A German king, dealing with internal problems.

415
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:33,920 
Should not you know it better than us Lala?

416
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:39,520 
They listened to enough. Reshenieto my final.

417
01:05:39,640 --> 01:05:44,360 
It is time to consider their own interests to
conquest of Constantinople.

418
05:05:44,640 --> 01:05:47,480 
Or ...

419
01:05:49,520 --> 01:05:53,560 
Zanos, our spies contact Genadeus.

420
01:05:53,640 --> 01:06:00,880 
As the time comes, will be able to pray
no Catholic natisk.Obeshtavam.

421
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:09,680 
Also, tell Urban ready with cannon.
Within two months go on the march.

422
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:23,040 
After much dust and smoke, this is wonderful.

423
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:29,680 
Thank you Hassan.
-I do not think you ate a delicious fish before.

424
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,120 
Very tasty smells.
There, ginger and bay leaf.

425
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:38,760 
I learned it from his father.
-Not the story of your family.

426
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:43,280 
My mother died when I was very small.

427
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:51,800 
My father was a great soldier, we were together
in Kosovo, and killed him there.

428
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:58,680 
Wanna try it?

429
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:07,600 
It is delicious! But I learned the secret of your fish.
-You will teach me how to pour cannon.

430
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:13,480 
It does not learn as easily as it is
arts.

431
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:16,480 
This is the fourth attempt, iron is not pure enough.

432
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:25,600 
Why stubborn dad? You can put tin.
-Know that will solidify before it gets into the matrix.

433
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:30,440 
If efforts fire will have no such problem.

434
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:38,840 
Fire is sufficient daughter.
-Let's try, the pots will last!

435
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:43,600 
No, too risky!
However, you say no!

436
01:08:55,120 --> 01:09:00,160 
Dear Giovanni Justinian.
-Emperor!

437
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:06,360 
You come to support us against the faithless.

438
01:09:06,400 --> 01:09:13,080 
You and your army is very valuable to us.

439
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:17,520 
We are grateful to be here, but ...

440
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:25,760 
But let's not forget the past when they
Our armies looted the city.

441
01:09:26,840 --> 01:09:33,880 
Do you think that you are unfair to
army that came to save your city?

442
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:44,360 
Our people will evaluate everything they do Notarez.

443
01:09:45,080 --> 01:09:48,000 
No doubt about it!

444
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:54,400 
You may be right.
-Very few copper have Dad.

445
01:09:54,440 --> 01:09:59,480 
Tomorrow will bring.
Night-workers will now come masters.

446
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,680 
You get some rest craftsman Mahmut, we will stay.
-Okay.

447
01:10:03,120 --> 01:10:08,560 
Father, let us go out early.

448
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:28,760 
This is the work of Notarez.
Thanks Hassan.

449
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:34,840 
Before falling walls,
will not have peace!

450
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,040 
Hassan!

451
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:57,240 
What do you think Dad?
-We did it this time, thanks to you!

452
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:12,480 
Well, we made an agreement with the Serbs and Hungarians Lord.

453
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,080 
So we will not have any problems during the siege.

454
01:12:16,160 --> 01:12:20,920 
Thanks for the valuable gifts that you sent to them.

455
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:21,480 
All right.

456
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:26,560 
Khalil Pasha realized that nothing is bothering you.

457
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:31,600 
Armies come there?
-Will soon arrive in Edirne.

458
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:36,720 
A ship?
-Will be ready Sultan added.

459
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:55,040 
"Poem"

460
01:13:17,200 --> 01:13:22,240 
What perfume you want to put it?

461
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:27,480 
Yasmin.

462
01:13:29,520 --> 01:13:32,560 
He likes the most.

463
01:14:10,320 --> 01:14:17,720 
This amulet took it from my father
Having killed him.

464
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,240 
So I can give it a brave man like him.

465
01:14:28,280 --> 01:14:32,680 
I will always wear it.

466
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:38,040 
Today is the big day, I'm worried. And you?
- I.

467
01:14:42,120 --> 01:14:45,560 
I do not want to come to the siege Era.

468
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:49,920 
You know it will come. And before we spoke.

469
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:55,400 
You do not want to happen.

470
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:01,640 
And I do not wanna happen.
And you do not you go then.

471
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:07,040 
War is not for women Era.

472
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:13,240 
NOT for women right?!
Have you forgotten what I've gone through?

473
01:15:13,560 --> 01:15:16,880 
They killed my mother and sisters in the war.

474
01:15:16,920 --> 01:15:21,600 
There were soldiers, and killed them in our own house.

475
01:15:21,640 --> 01:15:25,240 
In war men die with pride, women ...

476
01:15:25,320 --> 01:15:29,160 
They lose their dignity, their children, everything!

477
01:15:29,880 --> 01:15:36,840 
I will go to this war!
Nobody can stop me!

478
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:03,640 
My compliments Urban Master!
-Thank you.

479
01:17:06,720 --> 01:17:09,960 
A good time!

480
01:18:20,640 --> 01:18:25,680

01:20:14,440 --> 01:20:18,480 
Win! Mehmed Bravo!

484
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,160

01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:46,320 
Come here.

487
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,080 
Come on, son!

488
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:05,240 
Dad!

489
01:21:36,280 --> 01:21:40,320 
I wrote it for you.

490
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:31,560 
Precious commanders! Brave soldiers! Full of faith folks!

491
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:39,480 
We are under the protection of the Virgin Mary!

492
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:43,960 
Find the courage to threaten us again!

493
01:22:44,040 --> 01:22:49,640 
-Fucking Turks!

494
01:22:49,680 --> 01:23:00,400 
Incorrect Turks are going to us
to pierce their venomous teeth in our throats!

495
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:09,360 
They think they will be able to pass the strongest
walls of history!

496
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:14,440 
But we will drown in their own blood!

497
01:23:15,480 --> 01:23:25,120 
Children of Constantinople! I believe that each of you
will fight to the last blood!

498
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:36,360 
And I will write a new story!
God is with us!

499
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:14,040 
This gate is your Nikolamus.
Door Kreska - Commander Kontarini!

01:24:14,120 --> 01:24:18,240 
-As initiate Emperor!

501
01:24:18,280 --> 01:24:25,720 
Justinian, and your squad of archers keep
Romanos gate!

502
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:32,520 
This is our weakest spot.
If you enter, you will first fight!

503
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:38,000 
Do not worry. I will not let
and a Turk to enter!

504
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:44,000 
Orhan Shehzade will keep port Lang.
Aye-Emperor!

505
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:48,840 
God to protect our city.

506
01:25:30,320 --> 01:25:37,360 
Karadja grazing from Edirne to Ayvansaray is yours.
-As initiate my Sultan!

507
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:42,640 
Shehabettin grazing, they want you to curve the neck.

508
01:25:43,000 --> 01:25:49,240 
Suleiman Pasha fleet should take Halich!
The walls are weakest there!

509
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,560 
Zanos, you will keep Galata hills!

510
01:25:54,600 --> 01:25:58,360 
Hassan, you will command the best warriors.

511
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:04,600 
You and the horsemen will not attack before falling walls!

512
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:08,800 
You are free!

513
01:26:12,720 --> 01:26:19,160 
Attacked us in our most sacred day.
To shake our faith.

514
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:27,680 
But it will bring him bloody,
a victory for us!

515
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:40,880 
What we will only look at it?
Do not trust the promises of the Turks there?

516
01:26:40,920 --> 01:26:49,840 
Better than the Pope, believe.
However, you must protect your city.

Kalos-andromosikan.

519
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:55,160 
I wanted to welcome you in the palace of Sultan Mehmed.

520
01:27:55,200 --> 01:27:59,760 
But you're quite welcome.

521
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,440 
Thanks for the hospitality of the Emperor Constantine.

522

I have come to welcome you in this palace.

After us will remain one to this recall.

525
01:28:16,800 --> 01:28:21,000 
The walls of our town have heard it before.
Latest from your father.

526
01:28:21,280 --> 01:28:24,080 
But he refused.

527
01:28:24,280 --> 01:28:28,480 
We came to finish it.

528
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:36,480 
If you pass the town, the people will not lose
si.Shte property is completely away from any problems.

529
01:28:36,600 --> 01:28:40,480 
In this case, much blood will flow, your blood.

530
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:45,480 
We follow the path of the Qur'an.

Unable to kill a master!

Not forgotten era are still right?

543

Well Ayvansaray?
Same-Sultan added.

544
01:35:27,600 --> 01:35:31,480 
We were unable to either front.

545
01:35:31,680 --> 01:35:35,880 
Very large losses have a Lord.

546
01:35:36,000 --> 01:35:43,480 
We are trying to penetrate by Halich,
but as we get closer, our fleet firing their cannons.

547
01:35:43,600 --> 01:35:49,480 
Our soldiers should not lie,
will think that we gave up!

548
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:51,480 
And I also want to consider Zanos.

549
01:35:51,280 --> 01:35:59,480 
Tell channel master to dig faster.
Tomorrow will understand why my troops died.

550

Report!
-We have enough tar and oil Emperor.

There are no movements of the Ottoman army.

Collect your luggage clearly.
Understood in what have come to Hell.

553

We can not shoot often enough to
main gun.

554
01:36:53,480 --> 01:36:57,480 
If this begins to work, you shoot 10 times a day.

Turned my world.

Prayer, I am a witness that no god but Allah,
I witness that no other prophet than Mohammed.

It was once said something Hassan.

"Wants to keep the sword skill.
Neither will many clenching or less will behave.

If clenching a lot, you will quickly tired arm.
You can not fast.

582
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:14,480 
If you behave poorly in the first blow will
stay without a sword. "

583
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:18,480 
It is time to hold the sword properly Hassan.

584

E.Podgotvete is your turn.
-As initiate Sultan added.

We will be prepared.

Be careful Hassan.

I was in all fronts
There was no major damage.

601
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:57,480 
If we compare with the Turkish defeat.
-Were against the help of the Pope.

602
01:48:57,600 --> 01:49:01,480 
But as you can see the Turks lost everywhere.

603
01:49:01,600 --> 01:49:06,480 
To completely get rid of them
Pope should put more effort.

604
01:49:06,600 --> 01:49:10,480 
You must pritisnem army of Mehmed
walls between us and the Crusaders.

Do not worry, Pope convince Hungarians.

Well, leave it to us.

I will fulfill my desire, tell me!?

610
01:49:52,600 --> 01:49:56,480 
Tell your desire.

611
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:09,480 
If you see my beloved, tell her that I
died with dignity.

612
01:50:10,200 --> 01:50:16,480 
By bugger the beat
will tell her how you been.

613
01:50:17,880 --> 01:50:23,080 
I am Hungarian king Ladistas.
Fired his attorney.

614
01:50:24,200 --> 01:50:29,080 
Announce you that the peace agreement
is not valid anymore.

615
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:35,080 
And I hope to soon time to quit
of siege.

616
01:50:35,200 --> 01:50:42,080 
Remember how much pain and suffering
cause if our armies meet.

617
01:50:42,200 --> 01:50:50,080 
Tell the king that he would expect it
with his army here.

618
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:56,080 
Sultan mine, from the very beginning I said that
strike is wrong.

619
01:50:56,200 --> 01:50:59,080 
On the whole month here.

620
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:02,080 
Army gave us enormous sacrifices.

621
01:51:02,200 --> 01:50:10,080 
If the Hungarians come ...
-They only threaten Lala.

622
01:51:04,200 --> 01:51:08,080 
Even if true, they come when we
long will we have taken the city.

623
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:12,080 
If not we will fight with Constantine and
Hungarians.

624
01:51:12,200 --> 01:51:19,080 
Now go and tell them to shoot more often with guns.

625
01:51:26,200 --> 01:51:32,080 
Hungarian king his promise.
-Very nice.

626
01:51:33,200 --> 01:51:40,080 
As troops come, not only
protect their city, but will erase the memory of the Turks in history.

627
01:51:42,200 --> 01:51:49,080 
Are you sure we can shoot more often?
Do not worry, Dad, the mixture will work hard.

628
01:51:49,480 --> 01:51:54,080 
Put gunpowder master Mahmut!
-Done!

629
01:51:54,400 --> 01:51:59,080 
And you bring more of the mixture for subsequent shots.

630
01:51:59,200 --> 01:52:04,080 
Tighten firmly on guys!

631
01:52:11,200 --> 01:52:13,080 
Dad!
-Master!?

632
01:52:13,200 --> 01:52:10,080 
Pull up!

633
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:20,080 
Dad opened his eyes!
-Call a doctor!

634
01:52:23,200 --> 01:52:26,080 
This is my fault.

635
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:29,080 
What if you had died?

636
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:34,080 
Our Sultan!
-Go on!

637
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:45,080 
When will I be okay?
Until a few days, Lord.

638
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:49,080 
The main gun must be corrected in
soon.

639
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:59,080 
He did not think I'll fix it.

640
01:53:09,200 --> 01:53:17,080 
To run some of them that the Turks have morals.
Yes, we were dead!

641
01:53:22,200 --> 01:53:24,080 
Go!

642
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:07,080 
Get out of my eyes!

643
02:00:25,200 --> 02:00:30,080 
Why not leave yet?
-Unable to accept that it is defeated.

644
02:00:30,880 --> 02:00:34,080 
Hungarians come, hopefully
still be here.

645
02:00:34,480 --> 02:00:38,080 
I'll clean his boots with his clothes.

646
02:00:44,200 --> 02:00:48,080 
Welcome to Ak-Sheikh. I had to call you.

647
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:54,080 
With no one spoke.
In his chambers, you? Yes.

648
02:00:55,880 --> 02:00:59,080 
Two days does not go.
Our troops are restless.

649
02:01:17,600 --> 02:01:21,600 
Ak Sheikh! Welcome!

650
02:01:21,600 --> 02:01:25,600 
Well he found Mehmed.

651
02:01:25,600 --> 02:01:30,600 
What is it? Why your army does not fight?

652
02:01:30,600 --> 02:01:33,600 
40 days here.

653
02:01:33,600 --> 02:01:37,600 
Patience is the second name of the person.

654
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:40,600 
It keeps alive and your goal and dreams.

655
02:01:41,600 --> 02:01:50,600 
Failures, as in you and in your army
have created great sadness.

656
02:01:51,600 --> 02:01:55,600 
Hurt is the desire to fight.

657
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:59,600 
And unbelievers celebrate with joy.

658
02:02:01,600 --> 02:02:06,600 
Mehmed Come, come with me.

659
02:02:16,600 --> 02:02:21,600 
Before I came here three days, I prayed.

660
02:02:23,600 --> 02:02:34,600 
And last night, St. Ebu Eyyub el-Ensari came in my dream.

661
02:02:35,600 --> 02:02:40,600 
He told me where his grave.
He told me to show you the place.

662
02:02:40,600 --> 02:02:47,600 
Why lie so close to its walls tell.

663
02:03:28,600 --> 02:03:36,600 
You know, St. Eyyub with Islamic army was involved in
siege of Constantinople.

664
02:03:36,600 --> 02:03:44,600 
And do not go before you die before these walls.
It was young as you.

665
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:50,600 
It was old and ill.

666
02:03:51,600 --> 02:03:55,600 
You can not deny Mehmet!

667
02:03:55,600 --> 02:04:00,600 
You came here as a herald ruler.

668
02:04:00,600 --> 02:04:03,600 
You have to go with his troops.

669
02:04:03,600 --> 02:04:09,600 
If you do not now, never
to you.

670
02:04:10,600 --> 02:04:19,600 
Find Forces perk. And show
leadership skills of your opponents!

671
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:23,600 
You have this power Mehmed.

672
02:04:24,600 --> 02:04:32,600 
Do not forget! Strong winds only in
high mountains wave.

673
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:46,600 
I will not die before you conquer the city Dad!

674
02:06:46,600 --> 02:04:52,600 
Made in the land of ships that entered
in Halich!

675
02:06:54,600 --> 02:07:00,600 
As we think will be denied ...
-The people and our army is restless Lord.

676
02:07:01,600 --> 02:07:06,600 
This is not good.
-He wants to reach the weakest points in our walls.

677
02:07:07,600 --> 02:07:12,600 
Our ships could not sink them.
Bombard us with reams of Galata.

678
02:07:13,600 --> 02:07:16,600 
You should send troops to Halich.

679
02:07:16,600 --> 02:07:19,600 
If we send out there in other places will lose weight.

680
02:07:20,600 --> 02:07:25,600 
We will build a bridge of ships and troops will spend!

681
02:07:25,600 --> 02:07:29,600 
These Hungarians still did not come!
, Justinian!

682
02:07:30,600 --> 02:07:33,600 
Immediately send troops to Halich.

683
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:41,600 
Notarez! Find Genadeus, and say to
raise the morale of the people.

684
02:08:15,600 --> 02:08:19,600 
I came to ask for something on behalf of
Genadeus emperor.

685
02:08:19,600 --> 02:08:22,600 
He sold me the religion of the Pope.
He's not my emperor.

686
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:26,600 
You know I think like you.

687
02:08:26,600 --> 02:08:32,600 
But in these difficult days should help.
The people are scared.

688
02:08:32,600 --> 02:08:35,600 
Do not you see?

689
02:08:35,600 --> 02:08:38,600 
Use the power over people.

690
02:08:38,600 --> 02:08:44,600 
I do enough, but sold to Orthodox Catholics ...

691
02:08:44,600 --> 02:08:54,600 
And all these things happen, made
beliefs of the people to go off as the lights of St. Sophia.

692
02:08:54,600 --> 02:08:58,600 
All are helpless.

693
02:09:05,600 --> 02:09:08,600 
My heroes!

694
02:09:08,600 --> 02:09:13,600 
Our past is full of win!

695
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:16,600 
We took the hardest castles and cities!

696
02:09:16,600 --> 02:09:19,600 
We crossed the high mountains!

697
02:09:19,600 --> 02:09:26,600 
I broke the swords of their enemies!

698
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:32,600 
We took their flags!

699
02:09:38,600 --> 02:09:44,600 
Today! We will prove our ancestors,
that we are worthy successors!

700
02:09:45,600 --> 02:09:51,600 
Do not forget! Large gains are
achieved with faith!

701
02:09:52,600 --> 02:09:58,600 
I know our courage will cross these walls!

702
02:09:58,600 --> 02:10:06,600 
By morning, will open the eyes of a
wonderful day!

703
02:10:07,600 --> 02:10:13,600 
I will not drink sherbet success before
Defeat your enemies!

704
02:10:14,600 --> 02:10:30,600 
Allah is great!
-God is great!

705
02:10:39,600 --> 02:10:42,600 
I was looking for you.

706
02:10:56,600 --> 02:11:02,600 
Tomorrow we will see!

707
02:11:03,600 --> 02:11:08,600 
We will avenge you and Era.

708
02:11:30,600 --> 02:11:33,600 
Hassan!

709
02:11:53,600 --> 02:11:57,600 
<i> May 29, 1453</i>
Tuesday </ i>

710
02:11:58,600 --> 02:12:10,600 
<i> Morning church service (flat) </ i></i>

711
02:12:31,600 --> 02:12:39,600 
Today will be the greatest attack.
If we win this war would end.

712
02:12:39,600 --> 02:12:45,600 
The people you will celebrate our victory!

713
02:12:58,600 --> 02:13:05,600 
<i> May Allah (the force) be with you ... (Arabic) </ i></i>

714
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:16,600 
Another brother did not stay.

715
02:13:16,600 --> 02:13:19,600 
This time could not find us.

716
02:13:26,600 --> 02:13:30,600 
I do not want mistakes! Get out!

717
02:13:51,600 --> 02:13:54,600 
Fire!

718
02:13:57,600 --> 02:14:03,600 
Attack!

719
02:14:48,600 --> 02:13:52,600 
It should be away from here Lord.

720
02:14:52,600 --> 02:13:55,600 
You should go back to the palace.

721
02:14:55,600 --> 02:15:00,600 
While it away, you must
in a safe place.

722
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:13,600 
Remember the promise of my favorite!

723
02:16:17,600 --> 02:16:21,600 
You'll find her, tell her that he died with dignity!

724
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:30,600 
Climb the tower!

725
02:17:36,600 --> 02:17:41,600 
This death will be difficult for you!
The winners write history!

726
02:17:41,600 --> 02:17:47,600 
With us not forget the fallen!
But now you die!

727
02:22:09,600 --> 02:22:14,600 
Flee, save your life!

728
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:26,600 
Divine Light of the people and our army
I think I pulled into Heaven.

729
02:22:27,600 --> 02:22:31,600 
You must leave town Emperor.

730
02:22:32,600 --> 02:22:37,600 
Divine light ...

731
02:22:38,600 --> 02:22:43,600 
Climbed at a much higher place Notarez.

732
02:22:44,600 --> 02:22:49,600 
For dignity,
must fight all the way!

733
02:23:04,600 --> 02:23:08,600 
Kill him!

734
02:23:13,600 --> 02:23:17,600 
Do not let him off our flag!

735
02:26:17,600 --> 02:26:23,600 
The Emperor is dead!

736
02:26:23,600 --> 02:26:28,600 
Detained you!

737
02:26:42,600 --> 02:22:45,600 
Long live the Sultan!
-Long live the Sultan!

738
02:26:48,600 --> 02:26:52,600 
Stand up.

739
02:26:53,600 --> 02:26:59,600 
Bury Emperor, upon your faith.

740
02:28:22,600 --> 02:28:25,600 
Do not panic!

741
02:28:25,600 --> 02:28:34,600 
We are a nation anymore.
Property is one thing, our destinies are one.

742
02:28:42,600 --> 02:28:49,600 
You are free to keep their religion.

743
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:32,600
