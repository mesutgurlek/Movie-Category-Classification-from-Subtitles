1
00:03:03,863 --> 00:03:05,865
Peking - China.

2
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:09,108
The summer
of the year 1900.

3
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:12,071
The rains are late,

4
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,634
the crops have failed,

5
00:03:15,235 --> 00:03:17,637
a hundred million
Chinese are hungry

6
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:20,079
and a violent wind
of discontent

7
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,641
disturbs the land.

8
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:24,644
Within the foreign compound

9
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:27,607
a thousand foreigners
live and work,

10
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:30,649
citizens of a dozen
far-off nations.

11
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:50,389
Priests and missionaries,

12
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,872
bankers and businessmen,

13
00:03:53,153 --> 00:03:54,994
engineers and adventurers,

14
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:58,037
diplomats,
soldiers and students...

15
00:03:58,478 --> 00:04:01,040
People with families, homes,

16
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:02,482
jobs.

17
00:04:02,962 --> 00:04:06,405
Many have lived here
a lifetime and feel secure

18
00:04:06,606 --> 00:04:08,848
as they go about
their daily routine.

19
00:05:38,818 --> 00:05:41,100
What is
that terrible noise?

20
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:44,584
Different nations
saying the same thing,

21
00:05:44,784 --> 00:05:45,865
We want China.

22
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:58,918
Sha-shao!

23
00:06:02,722 --> 00:06:04,724
Separated from the compound

24
00:06:04,924 --> 00:06:07,286
by only
a wall and a gate,

25
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:09,408
is the Forbidden City.

26
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:13,292
Here, in untouchable isolation

27
00:06:13,733 --> 00:06:17,536
lives the Dowager Empress,
last of the Manchus.

28
00:06:18,098 --> 00:06:20,340
Protected by
an army of eunuchs,

29
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,542
she holds court
and confers with her ministers,

30
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,025
mandarins and generals.

31
00:06:27,107 --> 00:06:28,268
Halt the execution.

32
00:06:28,828 --> 00:06:30,389
But Prince Tuan s orders!

33
00:06:31,951 --> 00:06:32,911
Now

34
00:06:33,113 --> 00:06:34,354
you have my orders.
The nightingale will recover.

35
00:07:38,338 --> 00:07:40,660
The Court physician s
arts will work.

36
00:07:52,792 --> 00:07:55,514
Only yesterday
I listened to its song.

37
00:07:56,356 --> 00:07:58,277
The execution
has been stopped.

38
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,560
Who?

39
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,720
Jung-Lu,

40
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:03,203
Your Majesty,

41
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:15,655
I come to ask
your displeasure.

42
00:08:16,096 --> 00:08:18,057
My life instead
of the Colonel s.

43
00:08:18,258 --> 00:08:19,939
We cannot spare you.

44
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,222
I gave the order
to fire on the Boxers.

45
00:08:23,703 --> 00:08:27,026
They were burning missions,
killing foreigners.

46
00:08:28,628 --> 00:08:30,149
We have sad news.

47
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:32,351
The nightingale...

48
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:34,113
it was your gift.

49
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:36,035
Do you remember, Jung-Lu?

50
00:08:36,316 --> 00:08:37,557
I have not forgotten.

51
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:43,203
I live to serve Your Majesty.

52
00:08:43,403 --> 00:08:46,406
How does the attack
on the Boxers serve

53
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:47,326
Her Highness?

54
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,570
If they are unchecked,
foreign armies will fall

55
00:08:50,770 --> 00:08:53,012
- on China.
- We are tens of millions.

56
00:08:53,693 --> 00:08:57,817
Does the Empress believe that
where the imperial Army has failed,

57
00:08:58,018 --> 00:08:59,139
the rabble will succeed?

58
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:03,182
- Our Gods are with the Boxers.
- The nightingale is still.

59
00:09:03,823 --> 00:09:06,345
I hear only
the sound of crows.

60
00:09:11,071 --> 00:09:12,152
Your Majesty,

61
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:16,195
a violent wind
is short-lived.

62
00:09:16,676 --> 00:09:19,478
The Boxers have arisen
like the wind and rain,

63
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:21,000
and like the wind

64
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:22,562
and the rain, will die.

65
00:09:27,687 --> 00:09:30,850
May the Boxers be guided
by the will of the gods.

66
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,413
About the Colonel, Your Majesty.

67
00:09:33,613 --> 00:09:35,134
His end
will be a sign,

68
00:09:36,016 --> 00:09:38,178
and a warning
to the foreigners.

69
00:09:38,658 --> 00:09:40,940
His death
is of no consequence.

70
00:09:41,581 --> 00:09:44,704
But his life has set
my Prince against my General

71
00:09:45,465 --> 00:09:48,668
and this disturbs
the morning s tranquility.

72
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:51,311
Let him die
for this offense.

73
00:09:59,879 --> 00:10:01,800
You are concerned, Jung-Lu?

74
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:06,526
If the Boxers fail,
I will give the foreigners

75
00:10:06,726 --> 00:10:08,888
Prince Tuan s head.

76
00:10:45,925 --> 00:10:47,486
Eyes front, soldier.

77
00:10:56,816 --> 00:10:59,138
All right,
Marines, eyes front!

78
00:11:01,341 --> 00:11:04,744
We re almost in Peking,
the capital city of China.

79
00:11:05,505 --> 00:11:08,668
This is an ancient,
highly cultured civilization,

80
00:11:09,109 --> 00:11:11,911
so don’t think
you re any better than them

81
00:11:12,112 --> 00:11:13,913
because they
can t speak English.

82
00:11:14,794 --> 00:11:16,996
A few Chinese words
go a long way.

83
00:11:18,598 --> 00:11:19,959
Repeat after me.
The word for yes is shih.

84
00:11:23,243 --> 00:11:23,763
Shih.

85
00:11:23,963 --> 00:11:27,526
- The word for no is poo shih.
- Poo shih.

86
00:11:28,128 --> 00:11:31,891
it s the same here
as anywhere else in the world,

87
00:11:32,412 --> 00:11:33,973
everything has a price.

88
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:37,897
Pay your money and
don’t expect any free samples.

89
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:39,859
Yes, sir.

90
00:12:06,246 --> 00:12:08,688
Right turn!

91
00:12:14,694 --> 00:12:16,696
Column... Halt!

92
00:12:34,714 --> 00:12:36,275
We going to stop that, Major?

93
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,520
Stay right there!

94
00:12:41,921 --> 00:12:43,402
- Murphy!
- Yes, sir?

95
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,239
Ni hao.

96
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:27,086
Tell the Boxer chief
I want to do business with him.

97
00:13:27,647 --> 00:13:29,208
I want to buy
the old man.

98
00:13:29,689 --> 00:13:31,530
But he's not American.

99
00:13:32,692 --> 00:13:33,853
Twenty dollars.

100
00:13:43,663 --> 00:13:44,503
Hold it!

101
00:13:45,505 --> 00:13:48,267
Tell him the old man
must be alive.

102
00:13:49,149 --> 00:13:50,590
Nothing if he s dead.

103
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:55,875
Forty dollars.

104
00:13:58,358 --> 00:13:59,359
All right.

105
00:14:06,606 --> 00:14:07,566
He s dead.

106
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:12,491
But he say

107
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:14,854
you pay
for spoiling the ceremony.

108
00:14:15,975 --> 00:14:17,016
Nothing doing.

109
00:14:17,617 --> 00:14:18,698
Twenty dollars.

110
00:14:32,392 --> 00:14:34,954
Tell him
I'll still do business.

111
00:14:35,715 --> 00:14:37,076
I'll buy
the dead Boxer.

112
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:40,480
Forty dollars.

113
00:14:42,202 --> 00:14:43,323
Twenty dollars.

114
00:14:56,456 --> 00:14:59,018
- Did you fire that shot?
- Yes, sir.

115
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:01,380
Nice shooting, Sergeant.

116
00:15:01,741 --> 00:15:02,782
Thank you, Major.

117
00:15:03,183 --> 00:15:05,064
That'll cost you twenty bucks

118
00:15:05,585 --> 00:15:07,506
out of your pay.
Fall in!

119
00:15:07,707 --> 00:15:09,668
Alright...
Fall in!

120
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:43,062
- Take them to the barracks.
- Yes, sir.

121
00:15:43,263 --> 00:15:44,584
- Murphy!
- Sir?

122
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:27,626
Madame.

123
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:30,469
Tell her I’m waiting.

124
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,272
I have sent her
a note, Excellency.

125
00:16:33,473 --> 00:16:35,555
You re the owner.
Tell her.

126
00:16:35,755 --> 00:16:37,757
Here s your key, Count.

127
00:16:38,718 --> 00:16:40,639
Excellency, please.

128
00:16:41,321 --> 00:16:44,964
As Russian Minister here
I order you to get her down.

129
00:16:45,165 --> 00:16:46,686
As you wish, Excellency.

130
00:16:46,886 --> 00:16:50,449
But remember she is still
a guest. I cannot order her.

131
00:16:52,052 --> 00:16:54,854
Excellency, I think
you need a cold drink.

132
00:16:55,495 --> 00:16:57,737
- And so do I.
- Champagne, sir?

133
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:10,589
How are you?

134
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,912
it's been a long time.

135
00:17:13,793 --> 00:17:14,713
Natasha!

136
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:17,196
Baroness Ivanoff!

137
00:17:17,677 --> 00:17:18,838
Yes, Sergei?

138
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:22,122
You keep me waiting
and then ignore me.

139
00:17:22,682 --> 00:17:24,804
You are a little
nervous, Sergei.

140
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:27,527
I suggest something cool

141
00:17:28,728 --> 00:17:29,769
for all of us.

142
00:17:33,853 --> 00:17:34,974
Excuse me.

143
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:46,946
Natasha...

144
00:17:47,547 --> 00:17:48,147
Thank you.

145
00:17:51,551 --> 00:17:53,472
I won t talk
about the necklace.

146
00:17:53,713 --> 00:17:55,034
But you are.

147
00:17:55,395 --> 00:17:58,598
- As Russian Minister in Peking...
- Please, Sergei,

148
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,640
speak as
my brother-in-law.

149
00:18:02,882 --> 00:18:04,843
Natasha,
I've told Bergmann

150
00:18:05,285 --> 00:18:07,086
your visa s canceled.

151
00:18:08,848 --> 00:18:11,330
So you cannot stay
in this hotel.

152
00:18:11,891 --> 00:18:14,813
Or in Peking
or even in China.

153
00:18:15,175 --> 00:18:18,258
- By law you don’t exist.
- That s frightening.

154
00:18:18,818 --> 00:18:20,139
Where will you go?

155
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,662
To your Chinese friends?

156
00:18:22,982 --> 00:18:24,703
How you hate me, don’t you?

157
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,266
No, you re wrong.

158
00:18:28,748 --> 00:18:29,829
I don’t hate you.

159
00:18:31,391 --> 00:18:32,432
Go!

160
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:35,034
You fool.

161
00:18:36,716 --> 00:18:38,157
Is it my fault,

162
00:18:39,479 --> 00:18:41,120
if you lose everything

163
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:44,563
and end up naked
in the street...?

164
00:18:44,844 --> 00:18:46,245
Not completely naked.

165
00:18:46,966 --> 00:18:48,647
There s still the necklace.

166
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:55,214
Today...

167
00:18:55,655 --> 00:18:57,977
- She has to go today.
- Yes, sir.

168
00:18:58,538 --> 00:18:59,819
I'll see to it.

169
00:19:07,027 --> 00:19:07,987
Good evening.

170
00:19:08,188 --> 00:19:10,470
I want a room
with a bath this time.

171
00:19:10,670 --> 00:19:13,953
- Have you reserved, sir?
- You're late, Lewis.

172
00:19:14,314 --> 00:19:15,234
Hello.

173
00:19:16,036 --> 00:19:16,836
Hello.

174
00:19:17,077 --> 00:19:18,278
When did you arrive?

175
00:19:18,998 --> 00:19:21,000
- Today.
- Why so late?

176
00:19:21,321 --> 00:19:23,122
We walked
the last 10 miles.

177
00:19:23,723 --> 00:19:25,244
Don’t the trains work now?

178
00:19:25,445 --> 00:19:27,567
Gentlemen, the railroad
is no more.

179
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,608
- Major Lewis!
- Bergmann.

180
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:32,852
- Is there a room for me?
- They re all taken.

181
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,254
But if you'll wait

182
00:19:34,454 --> 00:19:35,775
- a short while...
- Fine.

183
00:19:35,975 --> 00:19:37,936
Thanks, Chiang.
Here you are.

184
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,939
Any time you need me.

185
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,982
Half my life s here.
Take care of it.

186
00:19:43,183 --> 00:19:45,505
And more of your life’s here.

187
00:19:48,268 --> 00:19:49,509
Oh, yes.

188
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,991
Let me use the bin.

189
00:19:55,075 --> 00:19:56,196
Wont you open it?

190
00:19:57,117 --> 00:19:58,958
Open it and
you must read it.

191
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,680
Then you must answer.

192
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:02,361
Lewis!

193
00:20:02,562 --> 00:20:04,203
- Ah, Carlo!
- My dear chap!

194
00:20:04,604 --> 00:20:06,085
- Captain.
- You re late.

195
00:20:06,286 --> 00:20:07,407
What kept you?

196
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,889
I lost 2 men.
Had to bury them.

197
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:12,732
- Come on, let's get a drink.
- Alright.

198
00:20:13,373 --> 00:20:15,855
Try and get a room
here too, Andy.

199
00:20:16,096 --> 00:20:18,057
I want to look up the kid.

200
00:20:18,298 --> 00:20:19,979
Ah yes, your little girl.

201
00:20:21,221 --> 00:20:23,383
- How old is she now?
-11.

202
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:25,024
No, she must be 12.

203
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:28,268
It s a pity. No mother
and practically no father.

204
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:29,469
What can I do?

205
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:32,952
She s in a French mission
for Chinese orphans.

206
00:20:33,153 --> 00:20:34,634
You re better than most.

207
00:20:35,595 --> 00:20:37,116
You do try to see her.

208
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:40,480
But leaving her in a mission
is no way to raise her.

209
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:41,801
But what do I do?

210
00:20:42,042 --> 00:20:43,563
Take her to Illinois?

211
00:20:43,763 --> 00:20:45,805
How would she make out there?

212
00:20:46,006 --> 00:20:47,927
They'd treat her
like a freak.

213
00:20:48,128 --> 00:20:50,690
She s better off
among her own kind.

214
00:20:51,131 --> 00:20:52,852
- You really think so?
- Sure.

215
00:20:54,494 --> 00:20:56,055
May I have your key?

216
00:20:57,817 --> 00:21:00,419
I need it for
the American officer.

217
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:04,543
Thank you.

218
00:21:05,225 --> 00:21:05,985
Besides,

219
00:21:06,186 --> 00:21:08,107
you have to live
your own life.

220
00:21:15,555 --> 00:21:17,316
I've just had an invitation.

221
00:21:25,165 --> 00:21:26,726
Please sit down, Major.

222
00:21:28,048 --> 00:21:30,050
Ask him and
we'll drink together.

223
00:21:31,411 --> 00:21:32,692
He d tell us his troubles.

224
00:21:33,613 --> 00:21:35,214
What shall I tell you?

225
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:38,137
That you're happy I’m here.

226
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:40,620
You re very direct.

227
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:43,222
I’m a marine.
I’m short on time.

228
00:21:45,585 --> 00:21:47,306
How much is there for me?

229
00:21:49,229 --> 00:21:49,869
All you want.

230
00:21:52,592 --> 00:21:55,354
Have you found
this approach successful?

231
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:58,477
Not really, no.

232
00:21:58,958 --> 00:22:00,239
I don’t know another.

233
00:22:02,882 --> 00:22:04,283
Keep drinking, Major.

234
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,485
The uniform
will hold you.

235
00:22:12,772 --> 00:22:15,334
- Clever women make me nervous.
- No, please...

236
00:22:18,338 --> 00:22:19,539
Please don’t go.

237
00:22:26,626 --> 00:22:29,068
What can I offer you?
My life?

238
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:30,590
My room.

239
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:32,392
They gave it to you.

240
00:22:37,197 --> 00:22:38,798
Is that too much to ask?

241
00:22:39,319 --> 00:22:41,361
My life isn't worth much,

242
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:44,764
but hotel rooms here
are at a premium.

243
00:22:45,325 --> 00:22:47,967
Do you always offer
your life to strangers?

244
00:22:48,888 --> 00:22:50,329
To a soldier, strangers

245
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,611
are the best friends.

246
00:22:51,811 --> 00:22:53,332
I’m not in uniform, Major.

247
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:56,616
Things are fine
as they are.

248
00:22:59,699 --> 00:23:00,659
Major Lewis.

249
00:23:01,461 --> 00:23:03,422
A British orderly
to see you.

250
00:23:06,706 --> 00:23:09,068
The Minister wishes
to see you, sir.

251
00:23:09,269 --> 00:23:10,990
He told me to tell you

252
00:23:11,191 --> 00:23:14,194
he s been authorized
to act for your Minister.

253
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:17,556
Fine. Tell him
I'll be right along.

254
00:23:17,797 --> 00:23:18,717
Yes, sir.

255
00:23:25,805 --> 00:23:26,806
Here s you key.

256
00:23:27,567 --> 00:23:28,487
Thanks.

257
00:23:28,968 --> 00:23:30,289
What about your things?

258
00:23:35,615 --> 00:23:38,618
- Put them back.
- But there s only one room.

259
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:42,462
Let the Baroness
figure it out. She s clever.

260
00:23:43,743 --> 00:23:45,104
Don’t laugh yet, Major.

261
00:23:47,987 --> 00:23:49,708
It s a very small room.

262
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,112
I've been
in tight places before.

263
00:23:54,074 --> 00:23:55,235
So have I, Major.

264
00:24:14,894 --> 00:24:16,175
- Daddy!
- Teresa!

265
00:24:18,178 --> 00:24:19,138
Daddy!

266
00:24:21,101 --> 00:24:22,021
Daddy!

267
00:24:38,638 --> 00:24:41,080
- Hello, Britten.
- Good day, sir.

268
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:43,563
Wake up, sentries!

269
00:24:44,124 --> 00:24:46,446
Take a tip
from an old soldier.

270
00:24:46,926 --> 00:24:50,289
Whenever you see a Major
of the American Marines,

271
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,491
you will present arms.

272
00:24:52,812 --> 00:24:53,973
And don't forget it!

273
00:24:56,176 --> 00:24:58,978
If this be I,
as I suppose it be,

274
00:24:59,299 --> 00:25:01,781
my little dog
will know me.

275
00:25:02,382 --> 00:25:03,342
Come in.

276
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:07,306
I’m, sorry,
are you busy?

277
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:09,348
Of course I am.
I always am.

278
00:25:09,789 --> 00:25:11,951
Busier than usual?
Or just busy?

279
00:25:12,632 --> 00:25:13,753
Both.

280
00:25:14,474 --> 00:25:17,316
Well, what s
the pressing female problem?

281
00:25:17,877 --> 00:25:20,479
Just this,
Am I to pack or not to pack?

282
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,041
Do we go to England?

283
00:25:22,242 --> 00:25:24,524
Do we leave
this year or not?

284
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,331
I don’t know.

285
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:32,932
You don’t know...

286
00:25:33,133 --> 00:25:36,296
Pack. If we don’t go,
all you need do is unpack.

287
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:39,218
If men had
to do the packing,

288
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,140
the world
would be different.

289
00:25:41,341 --> 00:25:42,622
- If I had my way...
- What?

290
00:25:42,822 --> 00:25:46,305
We d have packed long since
and now be miles away.

291
00:25:46,506 --> 00:25:47,667
We?

292
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:49,428
A comforting thought.

293
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:51,150
Thank you, darling.

294
00:25:52,872 --> 00:25:54,874
Will it all
go up in flames?

295
00:25:55,675 --> 00:25:57,917
- Not if I can help it.
- What?

296
00:25:58,878 --> 00:26:00,599
I'll put it
in a nutshell.

297
00:26:01,161 --> 00:26:04,644
If I encourage the Great Powers
to be tough with China,

298
00:26:04,844 --> 00:26:08,207
China will become just
another battlefield for them

299
00:26:08,408 --> 00:26:09,569
to fight over.

300
00:26:10,650 --> 00:26:13,572
It s wiser to accept
temporary humiliation

301
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:15,574
at the hands
of the Boxers

302
00:26:15,775 --> 00:26:18,377
in the hope that
by damping down the fire,

303
00:26:18,738 --> 00:26:20,619
the kettle
won t boil over.

304
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,941
And then?

305
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:26,265
I shall probably receive
the Government s displeasure,

306
00:26:26,466 --> 00:26:29,428
and we'll be retired
on an inadequate pension.

307
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,952
Remember what Napoleon said?

308
00:26:33,153 --> 00:26:34,314
I never forget it.

309
00:26:34,674 --> 00:26:36,035
Let China sleep.

310
00:26:36,236 --> 00:26:38,958
' When she wakes,
the world will tremble.

311
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,401
He said a lot, didn't he?

312
00:26:43,763 --> 00:26:44,643
Come in.

313
00:26:47,007 --> 00:26:49,129
- Major Lewis, sir.
- Ask him to wait.

314
00:26:49,329 --> 00:26:52,211
Darling, I have to put on
my official face.

315
00:26:53,493 --> 00:26:55,695
You haven’t forgotten
our soirée?

316
00:26:55,975 --> 00:26:58,737
Twenty-four bottles of champagne
are already on ice.

317
00:26:58,978 --> 00:27:02,661
- Anything else the Sahib requires?
- The first waltz.

318
00:27:02,902 --> 00:27:04,023
I'll consider it.

319
00:27:11,711 --> 00:27:12,671
Philip!

320
00:27:16,916 --> 00:27:18,437
Major Lewis, Sir Arthur.

321
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:27,526
Stand up, sit down,
or walk around the room.

322
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,050
I'll walk around.
You please yourself.

323
00:27:31,251 --> 00:27:33,653
I have an unpleasant
task to fulfill.

324
00:27:34,854 --> 00:27:38,497
First, congratulations on
your initiative this morning.

325
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:40,299
We were a little late.

326
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:43,182
Unfortunate that
a Chinese was killed.

327
00:27:43,463 --> 00:27:46,305
- A Boxer?
- A Chinese citizen, Major.

328
00:27:47,107 --> 00:27:49,349
You re not
in the Wild West now.

329
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:52,752
You can t shoot
Chinese like red Indians.

330
00:27:52,952 --> 00:27:53,872
No, sir.

331
00:27:54,794 --> 00:27:57,436
Secondly,
I warn you that such

332
00:27:57,677 --> 00:27:59,158
irresponsible behaviour,

333
00:27:59,399 --> 00:28:01,200
could easily
involve us all

334
00:28:01,401 --> 00:28:03,803
in a great conflagration.

335
00:28:04,004 --> 00:28:05,165
I understand.

336
00:28:06,446 --> 00:28:08,568
And lastly, since

337
00:28:08,808 --> 00:28:12,291
your Minister is suffering
from a diplomatic illness,

338
00:28:12,492 --> 00:28:15,294
you are required
here no longer.

339
00:28:17,537 --> 00:28:19,779
No longer
required by whom?

340
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:23,062
This is a message
from your own Legation.

341
00:28:23,263 --> 00:28:25,305
I d be delighted
if you stayed.

342
00:28:25,985 --> 00:28:26,945
Yes, sir.

343
00:28:28,868 --> 00:28:31,270
You know all hell s
going to break loose?

344
00:28:32,312 --> 00:28:35,915
If it does, it will not be
because we have provoked it.

345
00:28:36,516 --> 00:28:39,639
So we'll all
just walk soft and

346
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,081
hope for the best.

347
00:28:41,681 --> 00:28:44,483
If we walked on our knees,
we can t stop it.

348
00:28:45,125 --> 00:28:47,727
I've just marched
from Tientsin.

349
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:49,529
Boxers are everywhere.

350
00:28:49,729 --> 00:28:51,690
Killing white men,
missionaries,

351
00:28:51,891 --> 00:28:54,093
and all Chinese Christians.

352
00:28:54,294 --> 00:28:57,016
The Imperial Army s
doing nothing about it.

353
00:28:57,497 --> 00:28:59,659
Boxers have been
around for years.

354
00:28:59,859 --> 00:29:01,901
You re unnecessarily alarmed.

355
00:29:02,102 --> 00:29:03,623
Well, the next time

356
00:29:04,224 --> 00:29:07,947
I see them killing an English
priest, I'll try not to be.

357
00:29:10,470 --> 00:29:14,193
I've been a soldier myself.
I understand how you feel.

358
00:29:15,035 --> 00:29:17,157
But my job s to see
the larger picture.

359
00:29:17,717 --> 00:29:19,759
I wouldn't know about that.

360
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:23,443
I just patrol the rice paddies
in the back country.

361
00:29:24,044 --> 00:29:25,365
I know this much...

362
00:29:25,845 --> 00:29:28,647
If the Boxers come,
we'll need more soldiers

363
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:30,890
in these compounds.

364
00:29:33,853 --> 00:29:36,095
Well, now we’ve both
had our say.

365
00:29:41,661 --> 00:29:43,022
I'll go quietly.

366
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:47,307
Oh, by the way,

367
00:29:47,547 --> 00:29:49,388
it s our Queen s birthday.

368
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:52,671
Tonight we re entertaining.
Why not come?

369
00:29:53,953 --> 00:29:54,873
Thank you.

370
00:30:01,361 --> 00:30:04,484
I won t leave Ming.
I'll pack him in my case.

371
00:30:04,684 --> 00:30:06,605
Don’t be silly.
He d suffocate.

372
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:09,729
- What s that?
- He d suffocate.

373
00:30:10,210 --> 00:30:12,452
- It s only for five weeks.
- Come on.

374
00:30:19,579 --> 00:30:21,500
May we speak
to you, father?

375
00:30:23,263 --> 00:30:24,424
It s very important.

376
00:30:26,066 --> 00:30:29,349
There are no negotiations
at the moment. What is it?

377
00:30:29,949 --> 00:30:32,711
Mother says we can't
take Ming to England.

378
00:30:33,273 --> 00:30:36,115
- I wont leave my dog.
- He s my dog.

379
00:30:36,316 --> 00:30:39,399
- Who feeds him?
- Who taught him to sit up?

380
00:30:39,639 --> 00:30:42,561
Tell you what.
We'll cut him exactly in two.

381
00:30:42,762 --> 00:30:43,923
You each get a half.

382
00:30:44,564 --> 00:30:47,687
- Father. Don’t play King Solomon.
- Well, I tried.

383
00:30:57,817 --> 00:31:01,620
Atten...

384
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:03,742
shun!

385
00:31:07,587 --> 00:31:09,669
Shoulder...

386
00:31:10,750 --> 00:31:11,751
arms!

387
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:23,323
Present...

388
00:31:24,564 --> 00:31:25,444
arms!

389
00:31:45,705 --> 00:31:49,268
Slope...

390
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:51,471
arms!

391
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,453
His Excellency,
the Minister of Austria-Hungary

392
00:32:13,773 --> 00:32:16,055
and the Baroness Von Riedel.

393
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:20,299
Welcome, Prince Tuan,
to Her Majesty s Legation.

394
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,301
I am deeply honoured.

395
00:32:29,469 --> 00:32:32,912
His Imperial Highness,
Prince Tuan.

396
00:32:37,557 --> 00:32:39,959
I bring greetings
from our Empress.

397
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,162
You are
most welcome, Highness.

398
00:32:42,482 --> 00:32:45,565
Greeting and felicitations
to your great queen.

399
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:13,433
May the lions
of China and Britain

400
00:33:14,394 --> 00:33:16,235
live in peace forever.

401
00:33:16,836 --> 00:33:18,998
Our Queen is touched
by the words

402
00:33:19,199 --> 00:33:21,321
of your illustrious Empress.

403
00:33:23,443 --> 00:33:25,044
Your Imperial Highness,

404
00:33:25,565 --> 00:33:27,086
Your Excellencies,

405
00:33:27,287 --> 00:33:29,208
ladies and gentlemen,

406
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:33,452
the first dance
will be the Military Two-Step.

407
00:34:24,944 --> 00:34:27,186
Marvellous, fabulous.

408
00:34:27,827 --> 00:34:29,308
They should be
around my neck.

409
00:34:29,509 --> 00:34:32,592
Of course, Sophie,
you look naked without them.

410
00:35:18,518 --> 00:35:21,200
- Shall we join the line.
- No.

411
00:35:21,761 --> 00:35:22,681
Not yet.

412
00:35:23,883 --> 00:35:26,085
I've waited
for this a long time,

413
00:35:27,407 --> 00:35:29,248
and I’m enjoying it.

414
00:35:49,469 --> 00:35:52,391
Natasha, you blind us
with your glitter.

415
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:55,755
Would you recognize me
without them?

416
00:35:56,396 --> 00:35:58,958
I understand
you're going to Tientsin.

417
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:00,800
That's right, Excellency.

418
00:36:01,201 --> 00:36:04,644
There’s a Russian woman
who wishes to leave Peking.

419
00:36:04,844 --> 00:36:06,565
Anyone we know, Sergei?

420
00:36:06,766 --> 00:36:08,247
She d do well
to meet you.

421
00:36:08,448 --> 00:36:11,050
It may be her only chance
to reach Tientsin.

422
00:36:11,651 --> 00:36:12,251
It might be...

423
00:36:12,612 --> 00:36:16,215
If you disregard me the
Russian government will remember.

424
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:41,640
- Sir Arthur.
- Evening, Major.

425
00:36:41,841 --> 00:36:42,882
Lady Robertson.

426
00:36:43,083 --> 00:36:45,205
I wanted
to thank you personally

427
00:36:45,405 --> 00:36:47,807
for trying
to help Father Bemish.

428
00:36:49,609 --> 00:36:50,730
You know the Baroness?

429
00:36:52,492 --> 00:36:53,573
Yes, of course.

430
00:36:56,256 --> 00:36:58,137
It s been a long time.

431
00:37:02,182 --> 00:37:04,624
I know my husband
has thanked you.

432
00:37:04,984 --> 00:37:07,146
Yes, I've expressed
my gratitude.

433
00:37:07,347 --> 00:37:09,108
This is Baroness Ivanoff.

434
00:37:09,989 --> 00:37:11,991
- And Major Lewis.
- Your Highness.

435
00:37:12,312 --> 00:37:13,873
You must be the American

436
00:37:14,074 --> 00:37:17,877
who had the encounter
with the Boxers this morning.

437
00:37:21,721 --> 00:37:24,203
It was the priest
who had the hard time.

438
00:37:25,525 --> 00:37:27,807
My government
is most distressed.

439
00:37:28,008 --> 00:37:31,251
But do not conclude
that all Boxers are bandits.

440
00:37:31,451 --> 00:37:34,093
Most of them
are harmless vagabonds.

441
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:36,576
Market place entertainers,

442
00:37:36,856 --> 00:37:39,258
much like the gypsies
in your country.

443
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,381
In fact, Sir Arthur,

444
00:37:41,581 --> 00:37:45,264
I have brought such a troupe
to entertain your guests

445
00:37:45,465 --> 00:37:46,425
tonight.

446
00:37:46,986 --> 00:37:48,467
Boxers here?

447
00:37:49,149 --> 00:37:50,510
With your permission.

448
00:37:50,870 --> 00:37:52,271
Of course, Your Highness.

449
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,061
He wants you
to take this sword

450
00:39:42,262 --> 00:39:44,223
and try to strike him.

451
00:39:48,028 --> 00:39:50,630
Try it.
It s part of the performance.

452
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:03,202
If I kill a Boxer,
does that, er...

453
00:40:03,403 --> 00:40:05,445
create a diplomatic incident?

454
00:40:05,645 --> 00:40:07,326
There is no danger.

455
00:40:33,833 --> 00:40:35,314
You've made your point.

456
00:40:36,116 --> 00:40:36,716
Not quite.

457
00:40:43,803 --> 00:40:44,443
Bravo!

458
00:40:52,452 --> 00:40:54,614
I guess he wasn't
a true believer.

459
00:40:55,575 --> 00:40:59,378
It seems, Sir Arthur, that
your troops are invulnerable.

460
00:41:00,140 --> 00:41:02,142
Forgive me,
but the Major

461
00:41:02,342 --> 00:41:04,263
doesn’t seem
to play the game

462
00:41:04,464 --> 00:41:06,586
according to Chinese rules.

463
00:41:08,708 --> 00:41:10,109
I apologize, Sir Arthur.

464
00:41:11,071 --> 00:41:12,672
I don’t think he came here

465
00:41:12,872 --> 00:41:14,353
tonight to play games.

466
00:41:16,516 --> 00:41:17,597
Good night.

467
00:41:26,926 --> 00:41:28,767
Unfortunately, Sir Arthur,

468
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:31,570
I must return
to my duties at the palace.

469
00:41:31,971 --> 00:41:33,292
No need to escort me.

470
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,983
Ladies and gentlemen,
the next dance will be a waltz.

471
00:41:49,989 --> 00:41:53,352
- Aword, Sir Arthur.
- This is an insult to the British

472
00:41:53,553 --> 00:41:55,474
and a challenge
to all Powers!

473
00:41:55,675 --> 00:41:57,957
Areport
will reach the Kaiser.

474
00:41:58,198 --> 00:42:00,159
Her Majesty's Government

475
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:04,043
is not alarmed by this
Boxer invasion of its Embassy.

476
00:42:04,244 --> 00:42:06,966
I shall complain
to the Chinese ministry.

477
00:42:07,167 --> 00:42:09,369
What will you do, Sir Arthur?

478
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:12,491
I intend to have
a glass of champagne.

479
00:42:25,865 --> 00:42:28,387
You know,
I admire Sir Arthur.

480
00:42:28,628 --> 00:42:31,991
He makes me think
that God must be an Englishman.

481
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:43,042
We go and we go
and we don't get anywhere.

482
00:42:43,803 --> 00:42:45,805
Why not head back to the hotel?

483
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,969
- Are you tired, Major?
- Tired? No.

484
00:42:50,170 --> 00:42:52,612
Ready to turn in? Maybe.

485
00:42:56,296 --> 00:42:58,338
Ever been
inside this temple?

486
00:42:58,538 --> 00:43:00,900
Wed get a better drink
at the hotel.

487
00:43:08,188 --> 00:43:10,710
Very interesting.
Can we go now?

488
00:43:13,193 --> 00:43:15,315
But we haven’t
had our dance yet.

489
00:43:15,515 --> 00:43:16,435
Shall we?

490
00:43:26,966 --> 00:43:28,727
What'll you do
in Tientsin?

491
00:43:28,928 --> 00:43:30,849
I'll be entirely
in your hands.

492
00:43:31,051 --> 00:43:34,294
You are now but you keep
slipping through my fingers.

493
00:43:41,221 --> 00:43:44,984
I think I’ll get you to take me
to San Francisco with you.

494
00:43:46,226 --> 00:43:47,867
Why to San Francisco?

495
00:43:48,068 --> 00:43:50,430
It s where
they found all the gold.

496
00:44:07,567 --> 00:44:08,648
Just a minute.

497
00:44:34,034 --> 00:44:35,875
What s that trinket worth?
A lot of money.

498
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:24,323
We won t leave today. They've
killed the German Minister.

499
00:45:25,645 --> 00:45:28,728
But Matt, we must leave...
I have to leave.

500
00:45:35,295 --> 00:45:36,376
You have to wait.

501
00:45:36,576 --> 00:45:37,937
Your sword, Sir Arthur.

502
00:46:03,763 --> 00:46:05,244
You are well, Sir Arthur?

503
00:46:05,685 --> 00:46:07,446
If you are, Your Majesty.

504
00:46:08,088 --> 00:46:10,970
- We are pleased to receive you.
- It s an honour,

505
00:46:11,491 --> 00:46:12,411
Your Majesty.

506
00:46:12,612 --> 00:46:16,215
We have been informed
of the German Minister s death.

507
00:46:17,017 --> 00:46:18,778
The Boxers
will be punished.

508
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:23,302
But the people s anger
cannot be quieted so easily.

509
00:46:24,184 --> 00:46:26,226
The Germans
have seized Kiaochow,

510
00:46:26,426 --> 00:46:28,708
the Russians Port Arthur.

511
00:46:28,908 --> 00:46:31,790
The French have obtained
concessions in Yunnan,

512
00:46:31,991 --> 00:46:33,792
Kwangsi and Kwangtung.

513
00:46:34,434 --> 00:46:37,757
In all, thirteen of the
eighteen provinces of China

514
00:46:37,957 --> 00:46:39,518
are under
foreign control.

515
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:42,802
Warships occupy our harbors,

516
00:46:43,003 --> 00:46:44,924
foreign armies
fill our forts,

517
00:46:45,485 --> 00:46:48,127
foreign merchants
administer our banks,

518
00:46:48,688 --> 00:46:52,251
foreign gods disturb
the spirits of our ancestors.

519
00:46:52,932 --> 00:46:55,294
Is it surprising
our people are aroused?

520
00:46:55,935 --> 00:46:57,776
Please allow me to observe

521
00:46:58,298 --> 00:47:01,901
that Boxer violence cannot
redress China s grievances.

522
00:47:02,422 --> 00:47:04,464
China is a prostrate cow!

523
00:47:05,425 --> 00:47:09,108
The Powers are
butchering her for her meat.

524
00:47:09,349 --> 00:47:13,072
If China is a cow, she is
indeed a marvellous animal

525
00:47:13,313 --> 00:47:15,194
that gives
both meat and milk,

526
00:47:15,515 --> 00:47:17,837
but at the same time
grows stronger.

527
00:47:18,678 --> 00:47:20,840
She learns
Western arts of peace.

528
00:47:21,681 --> 00:47:24,844
But China s greatest virtue
is her patience.

529
00:47:25,645 --> 00:47:29,248
If she exercises that now,
she will achieve everything.

530
00:47:29,849 --> 00:47:30,850
And if not?

531
00:47:31,771 --> 00:47:32,812
If not,

532
00:47:33,453 --> 00:47:36,135
if violence
and impatience prevail,

533
00:47:36,696 --> 00:47:39,098
the blood of millions
will be shed

534
00:47:39,299 --> 00:47:40,940
and the agony be prolonged.

535
00:47:43,263 --> 00:47:45,385
Go to the window, Sir Arthur.

536
00:47:46,626 --> 00:47:49,108
I’ve arranged something
for you to see.

537
00:48:21,541 --> 00:48:23,462
Please inform
your government

538
00:48:23,663 --> 00:48:26,545
that Chinese justice
is swift and thorough.

539
00:48:27,267 --> 00:48:30,910
Those men murdered the
German Minister this morning.

540
00:48:31,391 --> 00:48:32,872
Where lies the guilt?

541
00:48:33,473 --> 00:48:36,996
With he who wields the sword
or who gives the command?

542
00:48:37,557 --> 00:48:39,559
You know
who gave the command?

543
00:48:39,999 --> 00:48:42,681
With your permission,
I d like to present

544
00:48:42,882 --> 00:48:44,643
an eyewitness.

545
00:48:46,686 --> 00:48:47,927
By all means,

546
00:48:48,288 --> 00:48:49,409
Sir Arthur.

547
00:49:05,105 --> 00:49:06,626
Major Lewis, Your Majesty.

548
00:49:09,109 --> 00:49:11,311
Evidently, Major, you possess

549
00:49:11,511 --> 00:49:14,914
secret information
about the Boxer leadership.

550
00:49:16,636 --> 00:49:18,557
It s not much
of a secret.

551
00:49:19,199 --> 00:49:20,920
Please go on, Major Lewis.

552
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:24,283
I saw the Boxer
commander this morning.

553
00:49:24,564 --> 00:49:26,846
The one who had
the Minister killed.

554
00:49:28,128 --> 00:49:29,129
You would know him?

555
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,133
It was Prince Tuan.

556
00:49:34,294 --> 00:49:35,735
You believe this story?

557
00:49:36,336 --> 00:49:37,457
I do, Your Majesty.

558
00:49:38,058 --> 00:49:41,221
And you ask us to take
action against Prince Tuan?

559
00:49:41,741 --> 00:49:43,582
I’ve come here
with the truth

560
00:49:43,783 --> 00:49:47,466
now known by the German
government and the other Powers.

561
00:49:47,947 --> 00:49:51,030
We reject your truth.
And your protest.

562
00:49:51,511 --> 00:49:54,393
We are pleased
to inform you that Prince Tuan

563
00:49:54,594 --> 00:49:55,835
is our closest adviser.

564
00:49:56,356 --> 00:49:59,318
He now heads
the Foreign Office.

565
00:50:03,483 --> 00:50:06,486
For our part, Great Britain
wants nothing more

566
00:50:06,886 --> 00:50:09,088
than continued
friendship with China.

567
00:50:10,050 --> 00:50:12,092
Because of the drought,

568
00:50:12,612 --> 00:50:15,414
the hunger and the unrest
among my people,

569
00:50:15,895 --> 00:50:19,018
of the merciless demands
of the foreign powers,

570
00:50:19,779 --> 00:50:23,582
the situation in Peking cannot
be expected to become tranquil.

571
00:50:24,744 --> 00:50:27,426
Therefore we
earnestly advise you

572
00:50:27,787 --> 00:50:31,550
that all foreign residents,
including diplomatic personnel,

573
00:50:32,472 --> 00:50:36,035
should leave Peking
within twenty-four hours.

574
00:50:38,918 --> 00:50:40,839
Is Your Majesty informing me

575
00:50:41,041 --> 00:50:44,324
that she is severing
all diplomatic relations?

576
00:50:44,604 --> 00:50:45,685
Not at all.

577
00:50:46,726 --> 00:50:48,527
Her Majesty
was clear enough.

578
00:50:49,089 --> 00:50:52,772
She is offering informal
advice for your safety

579
00:50:52,972 --> 00:50:53,892
and protection.

580
00:50:54,494 --> 00:50:56,576
- I am in favour of that.
- Major.

581
00:50:56,776 --> 00:50:59,939
She can't control the Boxers.
We d better get out.

582
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,461
Prince Tuan,

583
00:51:02,542 --> 00:51:04,704
you will see
that these gentlemen

584
00:51:04,904 --> 00:51:07,987
are escorted safely
to their Legations.

585
00:51:09,389 --> 00:51:11,230
We d do better
on our own.

586
00:51:42,102 --> 00:51:44,704
- Do we walk?
- Yes, very slowly.

587
00:52:11,051 --> 00:52:12,132
Keep walking.

588
00:52:23,343 --> 00:52:24,464
Squad!

589
00:52:25,585 --> 00:52:26,706
Double time.

590
00:52:44,524 --> 00:52:47,166
- Thought you d need some help.
- Thank you.

591
00:52:54,574 --> 00:52:55,815
Count the votes.

592
00:52:56,416 --> 00:52:58,337
We're awaiting
the American Minister.

593
00:52:58,898 --> 00:53:00,059
Oh, Mr. Maxwell.

594
00:53:01,461 --> 00:53:02,462
- Hello.
- Hello.

595
00:53:02,662 --> 00:53:04,263
Sorry to have
got you up,

596
00:53:05,185 --> 00:53:06,706
but we need your vote,

597
00:53:07,147 --> 00:53:09,709
on staying in Peking or not.

598
00:53:11,951 --> 00:53:15,674
The United States have no
territorial concessions in China.

599
00:53:16,436 --> 00:53:18,397
Nor are we interested.

600
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:22,762
I d better abstain, Sir Arthur.

601
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:24,604
I understand, Mr. Maxwell.

602
00:53:24,804 --> 00:53:27,086
I just wanted you to be here.

603
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:33,573
Congratulations, gentlemen.
It's unanimous.

604
00:53:34,494 --> 00:53:36,776
Nine votes
in favour of evacuation.

605
00:53:38,218 --> 00:53:41,140
Great Britain
has decided to stay.

606
00:53:41,421 --> 00:53:42,942
Alone if necessary.

607
00:53:43,463 --> 00:53:44,784
That s not possible.

608
00:53:45,065 --> 00:53:46,786
We d look ridiculous

609
00:53:46,986 --> 00:53:49,588
if we left
the British alone in Peking.

610
00:53:50,750 --> 00:53:53,072
Perhaps Britain
has its reasons

611
00:53:53,273 --> 00:53:56,155
for being the only
foreign power in Peking.

612
00:53:56,596 --> 00:53:58,157
Our friend is right.

613
00:53:58,358 --> 00:54:00,279
They may have
secret reports.

614
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,962
I’ve made it
completely clear.

615
00:54:03,163 --> 00:54:05,004
Admiral Sydney
is on his way

616
00:54:05,205 --> 00:54:07,207
with several thousand men.

617
00:54:07,407 --> 00:54:09,849
He’ll be here
in 9 or 10 days.

618
00:54:10,610 --> 00:54:13,412
Meanwhile, I refuse
to worry about

619
00:54:13,613 --> 00:54:16,856
the Boxers giving
a victory to Prince Tuan.

620
00:54:17,137 --> 00:54:18,938
Then the Germans stay too.

621
00:54:19,499 --> 00:54:20,419
Sir Arthur,

622
00:54:21,941 --> 00:54:24,944
we Spaniards
fulfill our obligations.

623
00:54:25,145 --> 00:54:28,027
There s no word for
flight in our dictionary.

624
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:33,832
We feel obliged to protect
the civilians who depend on us.

625
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:36,556
I recognize
that obligation, Guzmán,

626
00:54:36,756 --> 00:54:39,318
and I believe
that if we stand united

627
00:54:39,639 --> 00:54:41,761
the Chinese
won't dare to attack

628
00:54:41,961 --> 00:54:44,683
the representatives
of 11 great Powers.

629
00:54:44,924 --> 00:54:46,125
If we stand firm,

630
00:54:46,726 --> 00:54:50,169
there'll be peace in China
and in the whole world.

631
00:54:51,451 --> 00:54:52,892
Spain is with you.

632
00:54:53,293 --> 00:54:55,214
If the other Powers stay,

633
00:54:55,415 --> 00:54:57,096
so will Austria.

634
00:54:59,179 --> 00:55:02,101
Congratulations, Sir Arthur.
The British win

635
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:03,663
another bloodless victory.

636
00:55:03,863 --> 00:55:06,986
I take it You’ve
unanimously decided to stay?

637
00:55:07,187 --> 00:55:10,470
I shall report that
the first vote was9 to 1

638
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:14,073
and that in a friendly spirit
it was then decided

639
00:55:14,274 --> 00:55:16,316
to make
the decision unanimous.

640
00:55:16,996 --> 00:55:20,399
Well, then I suggest
we call in the military.

641
00:55:24,964 --> 00:55:26,125
This way, gentlemen.

642
00:55:32,252 --> 00:55:34,414
Colonel Shiba
will give the report.

643
00:55:36,936 --> 00:55:39,298
As to the military aspects,

644
00:55:39,499 --> 00:55:42,542
we have agreed that
with fewer than 400 men,

645
00:55:42,742 --> 00:55:44,623
to defend
a 2-mile perimeter,

646
00:55:44,824 --> 00:55:46,545
the position is untenable.

647
00:55:47,787 --> 00:55:49,989
We recommend
immediate evacuation.

648
00:55:52,512 --> 00:55:56,075
For political reasons the
Ministers say we must remain.

649
00:55:56,556 --> 00:56:00,039
So you must defend
the area until Admiral Sydney s

650
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:01,361
forces arrive.

651
00:56:01,841 --> 00:56:04,844
Sir, what if the relief
column doesn’t make it?

652
00:56:05,245 --> 00:56:08,328
It s over 70 miles
through hostile territory.

653
00:56:08,888 --> 00:56:12,011
We’ll consider
that situation when it arises.

654
00:56:12,572 --> 00:56:14,333
We have 5 defense sectors.

655
00:56:14,534 --> 00:56:17,496
The wall defended
by the Germans and Americans,

656
00:56:17,697 --> 00:56:20,299
the west end,
the British Legation,

657
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:23,462
the Fu, held by
the Americans and Japanese,

658
00:56:24,024 --> 00:56:27,787
and the east end, held
by the Italians and French.

659
00:56:35,515 --> 00:56:36,916
- Boxers?
- Yes.

660
00:56:37,157 --> 00:56:40,400
- Where the hell are they?
- All around us.

661
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:42,882
Their purpose is
to make us nervous.

662
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:46,806
Once the shooting starts You’ll
see them outside that wall.

663
00:56:48,608 --> 00:56:49,729
Who's nervous?

664
00:56:53,693 --> 00:56:54,453
No!

665
00:56:55,215 --> 00:56:56,656
You cant have them!

666
00:56:57,137 --> 00:56:58,378
But Sarah, we agreed.

667
00:56:58,858 --> 00:57:02,261
We need the books
for barricades.

668
00:57:02,462 --> 00:57:05,064
Not the Set of
the Napoleonic Wars.

669
00:57:05,345 --> 00:57:07,707
Mother sent them
for your birthday.

670
00:57:07,907 --> 00:57:10,669
I must confess
that French history bores me.

671
00:57:15,035 --> 00:57:16,996
English history? Bah!

672
00:58:15,695 --> 00:58:19,378
- Go away. The shop is closed.
- It s Baroness Ivanoff.

673
00:58:25,145 --> 00:58:27,907
I thought all Peking's
doors were closed to me,

674
00:58:28,148 --> 00:58:30,630
that I d lost face
in the Chinese streets.

675
00:58:30,830 --> 00:58:34,473
Our Empress has
those same fears, Baroness.

676
00:58:35,155 --> 00:58:36,236
The Boxers.

677
00:58:37,117 --> 00:58:38,438
It is hoped

678
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:42,001
her wisdom will prevail.

679
00:58:44,324 --> 00:58:46,205
I got your message, old one.

680
00:58:48,608 --> 00:58:51,330
Your friend thinks
you should leave Peking.

681
00:58:53,253 --> 00:58:56,296
- Which friend, old one?
- General Jung-Lu.

682
00:58:57,977 --> 00:58:59,979
It was not possible before.

683
00:59:00,300 --> 00:59:02,141
We would have been accused

684
00:59:02,342 --> 00:59:04,824
of meddling in
Russian affairs.

685
00:59:05,025 --> 00:59:05,985
And now?

686
00:59:06,666 --> 00:59:07,506
Now...

687
00:59:08,548 --> 00:59:09,909
it makes no difference.

688
00:59:10,430 --> 00:59:12,071
The Boxers will attack.

689
00:59:12,272 --> 00:59:15,194
If you disappear
in the confusion who d be left

690
00:59:15,395 --> 00:59:16,596
to point a finger?

691
00:59:17,437 --> 00:59:20,960
At 5 p. m. the fighting
will have begun.

692
00:59:21,601 --> 00:59:25,204
You’ll meet a man at the corner
of the French Legation.

693
00:59:26,206 --> 00:59:28,888
He’ll be wearing
a green peasant jacket.

694
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:31,171
You will be there?

695
00:59:42,862 --> 00:59:46,145
- Go up on the ramp and take a look.
- Yes, sir.

696
00:59:49,989 --> 00:59:52,311
- I don’t like this.
- Don’t worry.

697
00:59:53,913 --> 00:59:56,675
Tell those men
to get their backs into it.

698
01:00:02,002 --> 01:00:03,043
Whoa there.

699
01:00:08,808 --> 01:00:11,811
- Where are you going?
- I’m getting out of Peking.

700
01:00:12,012 --> 01:00:14,054
Those Boxers
out there are angry.

701
01:00:14,494 --> 01:00:17,136
- Not with me.
- We have 200 rounds each.

702
01:00:17,977 --> 01:00:21,180
- That s 20 per man per day.
- Enough for warming up.

703
01:00:21,381 --> 01:00:23,383
They d better start out warm.

704
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:25,184
Yes, sir.
I’ll tell them.

705
01:00:27,987 --> 01:00:29,508
Get out
before I get mad!

706
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:33,592
Mad Americans inside, mad Boxers
outside, mad Russians there...

707
01:00:33,793 --> 01:00:35,194
I’ll risk going out.

708
01:00:36,036 --> 01:00:39,799
I split the men in 2
platoons. 4 hours on, 4 hours off.

709
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:42,762
The sergeant will take
the first watch.

710
01:00:42,962 --> 01:00:43,882
Right.

711
01:00:46,206 --> 01:00:49,529
I wanted to go to Tientsin
but you prefer to stay.

712
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,291
I wear a uniform.
They pay me for that.

713
01:00:52,692 --> 01:00:54,013
Go on then.

714
01:00:54,214 --> 01:00:55,735
And get out of my way.

715
01:00:56,976 --> 01:00:58,817
Have a nice war, soldier,

716
01:00:59,259 --> 01:01:00,620
a real nice war.

717
01:01:04,144 --> 01:01:05,385
Where do these go?

718
01:01:05,905 --> 01:01:08,707
Where do you think?
Get up on that wall!
