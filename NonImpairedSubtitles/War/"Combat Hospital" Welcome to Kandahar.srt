1
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:14,733
This is flight deck. Prepare the cabin
for Combat Descent into Kandahar.

2
00:00:15,998 --> 00:00:17,336
Excuse me, Dr. Gordon.

3
00:00:17,703 --> 00:00:19,983
I strongly urge you to get
into your seat for landing.

4
00:00:20,103 --> 00:00:23,226
I can't right now,
I'll be out in... 2 minutes.

5
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:25,079
We're about to do a combat landing, ma'am.

6
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,977
We'll be flying an evasive pattern
so we don't draw fire.

7
00:00:28,097 --> 00:00:30,566
I know what a combat landing is.
I read the manual.

8
00:00:30,686 --> 00:00:34,080
Yes, ma'am. Did the manual say anything
about passengers throwing up?

9
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,872
Don't worry about me, I'll be fine.

10
00:00:35,992 --> 00:00:38,078
- Ok.
- Commencing combat descend.

12
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:51,930
B.P. 100 over 80.

13
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,520
When did you eat last?

14
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,950
Any drugs you're taking?

15
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,780
Any allergies to medication?

16
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,189
Where are we? Am I gonna die?

17
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:04,640
You're at the Role 3 Hospital
at Kandahar Airfield,

18
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,350
and you're gonna be fine.

19
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,640
Excuse me. Ma'am?

20
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:21,120
I'm looking for the Role 3 Multinatio--

21
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:23,479
Multinational Medical Unit. Yeah. Me, too.

22
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,139
Hi, I'm Bobby Trang.

23
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:27,469
Nice to meet you. Rebecca Gordon. 
Hi, Rebecca.

24
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:29,150
So one of us is walking the wrong way.

25
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:31,109
Uh, I just got directions,

26
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,170
and apparently, it is this way.

27
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,609
I'm sorry. I'm not familiar
with Canadian ranks.

28
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:41,639
I'm a major and trauma surgeon. You?

29
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,220
Brand-new captain and a brand-new doctor.

30
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,700
Oh, excuse me.

31
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,750
Excuse me. Can you--

32
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,790
Lewis, take point!

33
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,440
That was weird.

34
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,270
So you're a major?

35
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,220
Is that you?

36
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,730
You get reception out here?

37
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:09,750
Damn it. Yeah, I got nothing--
no bars, no messages, nada.

38
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,980
You're not even gonna read them?

39
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,720
No. They're from my ex.
He's turned into a stalker.

40
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,380
Excuse me for asking, but
are you feeling okay?

41
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:23,110
I'm fine.

42
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,960
I'm fine.

43
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,330
I'm just tired.
I don't sleep well on planes.

44
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:32,000
It's nothing that a solid eight
hours of sleep won't cure.

45
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,650
How's it going, Simon?

46
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:39,170
Piece of cake, Colonel.

47
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,680
Any sign of our fresh meat?

48
00:03:41,910 --> 00:03:44,410
Nice way to refer to
your future colleagues.

49
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:48,169
Let's see how long they last.

50
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:51,429
We have to find them first.
They're lost in transit.

51
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:54,529
Well, if they knew what was
coming, they'd stay lost.

52
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:55,520
We need the manpower, Simon.

53
00:03:55,521 --> 00:03:58,100
Really? I'd say we need more women.

54
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:02,009
Actually-- one of them is.

55
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:04,040
Oh, really? Now you're talking.

56
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,520
Well, I don't know what I was picturing,

57
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,190
but-- it wasn't this.

58
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:17,860
No. That's for sure.

59
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,560
I hope they have air conditioning.

60
00:04:20,561 --> 00:04:21,660
Yeah, right? 
Whew.

61
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,660
Outpatient clinic is closed.

62
00:04:47,661 --> 00:04:49,640
Just take a seat.
We'll see you as soon as we can.

63
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,600
Oh, no. We're not sick.
We're reporting for duty.

64
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:56,180
Oh, I'm sorry.
It's just that you looked a little--

65
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,100
You know what? Never mind. We can use you.

66
00:04:58,101 --> 00:04:59,900
We just had a rush.
We're about to have another one.

67
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,609
Okay, listen, clean the blood off the floor

68
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,040
so that no one slips, okay?

69
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:06,019
Oh, you don't understand.

70
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:07,689
Um, we're doctors. 
What?

71
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,820
Does that mean we have to show
you how to mop the floor?

72
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,840
No, no. I know how to mop a floor.

73
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:14,410
Great. I just think that may--

74
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,670
I'm going to reload these.

75
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,650
I guess we mop the floor.
I guess so.

76
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,670
Okay, who left their damn bags

77
00:05:23,671 --> 00:05:26,400
right in the middle of the floor?
Sorry, sir. We just got in.

78
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:29,840
Uh-huh. Captain Trang. 
Yes, Major Gordon.

79
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,919
We were expecting you yesterday.

80
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,090
I got stuck in Dubai. I got stuck in Kabul.

81
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:36,699
Any updates?
Dust-off 1-7's five minutes out, sir.

82
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,920
Dust-off 2-2 is right behind
them with four on board,

83
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:41,570
no details, TOC's only getting
every second word, sir.

84
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,020
Who are they?
This is Major Gordon, Captain Trang, sir,

85
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:46,940
reporting for duty.
We were expecting you yesterday.

86
00:05:46,941 --> 00:05:48,360
Sorry, sir. We both, uh, got--

87
00:05:48,361 --> 00:05:50,310
Don't tell me. Dubai.

88
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:52,650
You feeling all right?

89
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:56,310
Absolutely, sir. 
Yeah. I'm good to go.

90
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,670
All right. Follow me.

91
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,640
All right.

92
00:06:00,641 --> 00:06:03,990
Now we got recovery and I.C.U. here.

93
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,110
Sorry we gotta put you to
work the minute you get here,

94
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:08,540
but, you'll find this place
very unlike anything--

95
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,960
you ever experienced before.

96
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,420
Now we go three O.R.s here.

97
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,769
The main ward's down the hall at the end.

98
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:17,659
Uh, actually, Colonel, um,

99
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:19,120
I trained at both Detroit receiving

100
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:20,630
and Miami General, and we could see,

101
00:06:20,631 --> 00:06:21,390
four, five, -- I don't doubt it.

102
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:23,510
Even six-- we got mental health right here.

103
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,480
Down here's the central hallway.

104
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:30,230
And here--the U.S. Army
used to call this the ready room.

105
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,470
I haven't been able to
come up with another name.

106
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,080
The unready room, I call it.

107
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:37,050
Hey.

108
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,130
Well, hello.

109
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,800
This is Dr. Hill, our neurosurgeon.

110
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,140
Please, call me Simon.

111
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:48,379
I'm Rebecca. 
Hey, man. I'm Bobby.

112
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:49,680
Hello, Bobby.

113
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:52,450
You can change into your scrubs in there.

114
00:06:52,810 --> 00:06:54,050
Just the shirt.

115
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,330
Now you can store your firearms
in these lockers if you want to.

116
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,900
I wear mine because I'm
always going in and out.

117
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:03,289
And besides, I like the constant reminder

118
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,710
that we're in a war zone.

119
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:07,159
Sir, two minutes out. 
New details?

120
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,080
Yes, sir.

121
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:12,370
So did they, uh, did they
try to hand you a mop?

122
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:15,009
They didn't just try. They succeeded.

123
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,500
Oh, they tried that with me.
They didn't get very far.

124
00:07:16,501 --> 00:07:17,770
Let me tell you.

125
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,810
Yes, sir.

126
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,000
Sir.

127
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,220
You have emergency
medicine training, right?

128
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:27,329
Yes, sir, but just the standard 3-month--

129
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:30,450
Good. You're trauma team
leader, bay 4, all right?

130
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:32,720
Ready, sir.

131
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:36,549
Let's go. You, too, Simon.
Right behind you, Colonel.

132
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:39,420
To be honest with you, sir, I've
never been a T.T.L. before.

133
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,060
I like to think I'm a good diagnostician,

134
00:07:41,061 --> 00:07:42,190
but you know your ABC's, don't you?

135
00:07:42,191 --> 00:07:44,420
Airway, breathing, circulation.
So you'll be fine.

136
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:45,990
Uh, I have tons of T.T.L. experience.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,550
No, I want to leave you free for surgery.

138
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:50,770
Until then, stand by the red line
in case someone needs your help.

139
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:57,169
All right. They're here. Let's go!

140
00:07:57,170 --> 00:07:59,079
Bird landing any second!

141
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,370
All right. Trauma bay 4, doctor. This way.

142
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,660
All right, everyone.
I'd like you to meet Dr. Bobby Trang.

143
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,200
This is Captain Pam Everwood, your nurse.

144
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:07,010
These are your med techs,

145
00:08:07,011 --> 00:08:08,740
Larry Alexander and Christine Ezrin.

146
00:08:08,741 --> 00:08:10,620
You okay? 
Yeah.

147
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,220
Don't worry about it. They got your back.

148
00:08:12,221 --> 00:08:15,050
You're gonna need this.
Okay, everyone, let's go!

149
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,430
G.C.S. 9, B.P. 100 over 40. Pulse 102.

150
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:31,680
Labored breathing. I.E.D.
blast 5-0 minutes ago.

151
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,679
G.C.S. 9--should, uh,

152
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,790
should we tube him? 
Your call, Doctor.

153
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:40,590
Shallow breathing.
I'm getting nothing on the right side.

154
00:08:40,591 --> 00:08:43,260
Let's try some adrenaline. B.P. falling.

155
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,950
Okay. We'll tube him.

156
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,800
Can I get a-- B.P. falling. 75 over 20.

157
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:58,280
20 of etimodate and 100 of sux.
Given.

158
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,450
Can I get a smaller tube?

159
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:03,590
Do you want more blood, Doctor? 
Yeah.

160
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:06,340
O neg. O-2 sat 93% and falling.

161
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:09,590
Damn it. Get in there.
Blood pressure's dropping fast, doctor.

162
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,540
Get in there.

163
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:18,510
Want some help with that airway, doctor?

164
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:20,120
Yes, please, sir.

165
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:29,220
Stylet out.

166
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:32,700
It's in the right place. 
Bag him.

167
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:37,700
Shallow on the left.
Still nothing on the right.

168
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,660
Chest tube.

169
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,540
That got it. I'm getting
bilateral breath sounds now.

170
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,950
O-2 sat 95% and rising.

171
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,270
Do you want to get him to the O.R., sir?

172
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,090
Doctor, what would you like?

173
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,000
Whatever you say, sir.

174
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:51,400
No, don't get up just yet, son.

175
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:54,180
I'm Commander Royal, your nurse.

176
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,940
Everything's gonna be fine.

177
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:00,710
Do I-- 
Yeah, you've got your arms and your legs,

178
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,240
and everything you had yesterday,

179
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:04,329
including some ugly looking plastic tubes

180
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,580
sticking out of your chest,

181
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,040
which we gotta keep in for a few more days.

182
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,550
Mm. Yeah, your ribs are gonna
be sore for a bit, so--

183
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:16,000
you in any pain at all?
No, sir. Not really.

184
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,030
Well, you speak up if there's
anything that you need.

185
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:20,580
Anything at all.

186
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,400
Welcome back, soldier.

187
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:29,470
I'm Dr. Marks. 
You missed your C.O. by half an hour.

188
00:11:30,380 --> 00:11:31,870
He left you a purple heart.

189
00:11:32,870 --> 00:11:34,940
Your unit chaplain's got a satellite
phone so you could call home.

190
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,290
Your buddies are in the waiting room.

191
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:42,660
Thank you, sirs, both of you.

192
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:43,790
You don't have to thank us.

193
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:45,960
We're just the guys that get
to give you the good news.

194
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,049
Aha. There you are.
I have your orientation packets.

195
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:52,900
They have your room
assignments and your keys.

196
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:55,120
I also had your bags sent over already.

197
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:58,099
You are to wear these at all times.

198
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:01,199
The code 9-1-1 means drop
whatever it is you're doing

199
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,079
and get here quick. 
Beepers in 2006?

200
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,759
Old-fashioned, but reliable.

201
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,090
Which reminds me, Major, you
got a personal e-mail message

202
00:12:08,091 --> 00:12:09,669
sent via the D.N.D. in Ottawa.

203
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:11,150
You'll notice that you have your own

204
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,829
individual e-mail addresses
in your folders.

205
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,920
If you could ask your friend to
use that one in the future--

206
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:16,970
Uh, if he does it again,

207
00:12:16,971 --> 00:12:18,620
Just please tell him to eat crap and die.

208
00:12:18,621 --> 00:12:20,710
"Eat crap and die." 
Yes, ma'am.

209
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,829
Oh, got 'em all sorted out?

210
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,989
Yes, sir. Fine additions
to the team they are,

211
00:12:26,990 --> 00:12:27,960
if I may say so myself, sir.

212
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,090
You may. I couldn't agree more.

213
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:35,830
Walk with me.

214
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,830
Did somebody die without telling me?

215
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:40,450
No, sir.

216
00:12:40,451 --> 00:12:41,790
No, nobody died.

217
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:46,110
When he came into your trauma
bay, he was dying, no question,

218
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,639
but he went out alive.

219
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:52,410
And there he is-- P.F.C.
George Lowen, 19, from Dayton, Ohio,

220
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,320
and he's about to make a
call to his mom and dad.

221
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,800
All right?

222
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:59,640
I couldn't think, sir.
I-I couldn't even fit the tube in.

223
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:02,889
Well, that kid had the biggest
damn uvula I've ever seen.

224
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,280
You didn't have any trouble with it.

225
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:07,130
I've been doing it for 25 years.

226
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,880
You know what the most
important thing-- oh.

227
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:13,180
Sorry if I scared you.

228
00:13:13,181 --> 00:13:15,290
You didn't scare me. You startled me.

229
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,620
Ah. Well, I stand corrected.

230
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:21,289
That's a nice, uh, tattoo you got there.
Yes, sir.

231
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:25,150
Oh, come on. No, I mean it sincerely.
A sincere compliment.

232
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,730
Simon, you mind if I cut in?

233
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,430
Yes, of course, Colonel.

234
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:33,780
I will be in the unready
room, getting unready.

235
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,440
You did a very good job
with the chest tube today.

236
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,380
Thank you, sir.

237
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,709
How well do you know Bobby Trang?
Uh, we only just met.

238
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:45,130
So you've got nothing against him?
No, of course not.

239
00:13:45,330 --> 00:13:48,140
Well, you completely undermined his
confidence by stepping in like that.

240
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:52,499
Me? Sir, I didn't do
anything before you did.

241
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:55,200
No, I asked permission. You took over.
There's a big difference.

242
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:59,730
- You didn't see that line of red tape
on the floor? - Yes, sir.

243
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:01,880
You know what it means?
No one crosses the red line.

244
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:04,170
Unless? 
Unless instructed by the trauma team leader.

245
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:06,379
Exactly. 
Sir, the patient was tanking--

246
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:07,680
No, he'd would've survived another minute,

247
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:11,080
And by then, Bobby would've
ordered a chest tube.

248
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:15,100
Let me spell it out to you
in--in words of one syllable.

249
00:14:15,450 --> 00:14:16,980
I need you both.

250
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:20,199
Now I got eight trauma
bays and only three O.R.s,

251
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,359
and if I had to pick one of
you, I need a confident,

252
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,269
top-of-his-game trauma team leader

253
00:14:25,270 --> 00:14:27,540
more than I need a hotshot trauma surgeon.

254
00:14:29,450 --> 00:14:31,499
Do I make myself clear? 
Yes, sir.

255
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,970
Good. Other than that,
you did very well today.

256
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:51,739
Oh, I almost forgot.

257
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:53,620
That thing about the mop--

258
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,359
Don't believe Simon.
It's not some fraternity hazing ritual.

259
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,210
Blood is slippery.
We don't want anybody falling.

260
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,220
Now the nurses and the med techs,

261
00:15:01,221 --> 00:15:03,850
they know where everything is,
what needs to be restocked.

262
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,310
Doctors don't.

263
00:15:05,970 --> 00:15:09,930
So-- doctors mop the floors.

264
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,390
Really nice of you to show us to our rooms.

265
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:25,200
You being sarcastic?

266
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,660
Huh?

267
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:27,839
Don't worry.

268
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:30,100
Right, Bobby, you are up here.

269
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,270
Okay, that's Max, your roommate.

270
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:39,490
Lieutenant Colonel, U.S. Air Force.

271
00:15:39,491 --> 00:15:41,420
He's a nice fellow, but no one
really wants to room with him.

272
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:44,940
You can hear why. He could play
the tuba, it wouldn't bother me.

273
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:47,230
I'm gonna be asleep in about ten seconds.

274
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,019
What I wouldn't give to be able
to fall asleep in ten seconds.

275
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,620
With my luck, I will be up all day.

276
00:15:52,621 --> 00:15:54,460
Oh, really? You need something for sleep?

277
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,720
Yes. Why, you have something?

278
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,300
I have everything.

279
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,210
Now step into my office. I will fix you up.

280
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,780
Wow.

281
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:11,500
Now I don't know if you know
anything about oriental rugs,

282
00:16:11,790 --> 00:16:13,250
but these are the real thing.

283
00:16:13,251 --> 00:16:15,679
I paid, uh, $3,000 for this one here.

284
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,299
I could sell this in London
tomorrow for 40,000 pounds.

285
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,729
Uh, the wow was for your view.

286
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:24,410
Oh, yeah, that.
Well, one wants to have a touch of home.

287
00:16:25,060 --> 00:16:27,630
Well, what do you have to
do to get a room like this?

288
00:16:27,990 --> 00:16:31,299
Wait. Don't tell me.
A privilege of being a civilian.

289
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,989
Yes, and I don't have
to share with anyone...

290
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:37,530
Plus, they pay me an obscene
amount of--are you vibrating?

291
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,089
Yes, damn it.

292
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,360
Oh, it's rather good luck your
phone's even working here at all.

293
00:16:41,361 --> 00:16:42,280
Not in this case.

294
00:16:42,281 --> 00:16:45,160
Ah, unwanted attention. 
Ex-husband?

295
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,450
Recent?

296
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,549
Very.

297
00:16:52,550 --> 00:16:53,980
Can I offer you a drink?

298
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,619
Biohazard?

299
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:59,520
Well, it's only hazardous if
you're allergic to fine vodka.

300
00:17:02,350 --> 00:17:03,639
No, thanks.

301
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,280
All right. Suit yourself. 
Mmm.

302
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:11,390
Now did you leave him at the
altar and go off to war?

303
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,840
No.

304
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,840
Oh. Oh.

305
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,299
So he left you. Well, what an idiot.

306
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,650
Now it's a case of what on
his part--regret, remorse?

307
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:24,080
I don't know. I don't care.

308
00:17:24,081 --> 00:17:24,660
And I don't want to talk about it.

309
00:17:24,661 --> 00:17:26,690
You don't want to talk about it.
Well, I don't blame you.

310
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,970
Certainly explains why you can't
sleep, but you're exhausted.

311
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,839
Now would you like one
of the benzodiazepines?

312
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,830
I have several.
What you need to do is,

313
00:17:34,831 --> 00:17:38,790
you need to inhibit the reuptake
of dopamine and serotonin

314
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:42,140
and trigger the release of
oxytocin and vasopressin.

315
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:46,150
Of course, sex is the
natural way of doing it,

316
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:50,369
but-- there is a place for
the pharmaceutical approach.

317
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,690
Such as now.

318
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,750
Shame.

319
00:17:55,370 --> 00:17:59,920
Well, in that case, I suggest
a 2 milligram dose of--

320
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,060
9-1-1.

321
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:17,510
Come on!

322
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:23,430
Hot one! Hot one, sir.

323
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:25,370
E.H.V.I. with through-and-through G.S.W.S,

324
00:18:25,371 --> 00:18:27,720
right thorax and lower left quadrant.
Take him to 1.

325
00:18:27,721 --> 00:18:28,860
Roger that, sir.

326
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,159
E.H.V.I. with entrance
wounds here and here.

327
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,199
Corresponding exit wounds in back.

328
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:40,710
We sealed the sucking chest.
We gave him fluids and ox.

329
00:18:40,711 --> 00:18:43,600
And he's got 6 milligrams
of morphine on board.

330
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,750
E.H.V.I.?

331
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,719
Enemy High-Value lndividual. He's Taliban.

332
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:49,350
Later, people. We got work to do.

333
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,190
Give him 100 of propofol. We'll tube him.

334
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,440
Plug in a large-bore I.V.

335
00:19:06,441 --> 00:19:07,960
Flood him with o negative and saline

336
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:09,519
until we find a crossmatch. 
Given.

337
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,090
Thank you. I think the bullet
crossed the mediastinum.

338
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:14,120
I need chest tubes on the left and right.

339
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,220
Find the Colonel.

340
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,370
Tell him this one goes straight to O.R. 
Yes, sir.

341
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,710
Stylet out.

342
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:35,280
Strong breath sounds on the left side.

343
00:19:35,281 --> 00:19:36,770
I'll move on to the right side.

344
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,420
What's going on?

345
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:42,119
These guys are A.N.A.--

346
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,640
Afghan National Army. They're on our side.

347
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,940
They're afraid the Taliban
guy is going to escape.

348
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,860
Well, tell 'em he's not going anywhere.

349
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:50,830
They don't believe me.
They think he's faking.

350
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,219
Faking?

351
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:53,680
Yes.

352
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,300
Tell them to watch this.

353
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:05,560
Oh, dude.

354
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,870
Do they still think he's faking it?

355
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:12,530
All right.

356
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:22,660
Nice. That's it. Two. Three.

357
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:26,640
You got the needle? 
That was so badass,

358
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,950
how you just stabbed him like that.

359
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:31,900
Have you met Vans yet?
He's one of our terps.

360
00:20:32,470 --> 00:20:33,820
It's nice to meet you, Vans.

361
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:36,659
But I-I didn't stab him.
I just--I made an incision.

362
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,830
Whatever. You made the point.

363
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,820
I can't get in this vein.

364
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,580
Let's try somewhere else.

365
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,330
What have we got here, Doctor?

366
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:50,179
Adult male, history unknown,
presenting with G.S.W.s

367
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,439
to the mid thorax and lower left quadrant.

368
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,690
We sedated, intubated,

369
00:20:53,691 --> 00:20:56,479
placed bilateral chest
tubes for decompression.

370
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,070
He's had 3 liters each of saline
and packed red blood cells,

371
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:01,509
but he's losing volume as
fast as we can give it.

372
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:04,779
Recommend immediate laporotomy and
thorocotomy to control the bleeding.

373
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,650
No C.T. scan?

374
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:08,839
No, sir. In my opinion, the
risk of fatal hypovolemia

375
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:10,830
far outweigh the benefits of imaging.

376
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:13,450
Very good, Doctor. Will.

377
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,059
Uh, this guy goes straight to O.R. 3,

378
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:18,660
without passing go,
without collecting $200.

379
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:21,420
Yes, sir. Dr. Gordon
is gonna be the surgeon.

380
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,250
I'll assist.

381
00:21:33,240 --> 00:21:34,350
Very good job.

382
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,430
They taught you well at Miami General.

383
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,410
Thank you, sir.

384
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,620
Actually, sir.

385
00:21:40,621 --> 00:21:42,460
I was the youngest chief surgical resident

386
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:45,590
in Miami General's history--
Don't anybody move.

387
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:48,420
Just hold very still.

388
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,690
Could I have a fresh glove, please?

389
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:07,550
It's okay, Graham.

390
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:09,490
We're fine. Just had a snake.

391
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:15,120
Can't have snakes in the O.R., sir.

392
00:22:15,830 --> 00:22:17,650
Don't throw it away. Put it on ice--

393
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,900
to show our friend at Vickerdale.

394
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,190
Right you are, sir.

395
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:26,970
Dr. Gordon, you okay?

396
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:29,450
Fine, sir.

397
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:32,940
Uh, it's just that, uh,
that wasn't in the manual.

398
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:44,860
♪ I'm sending out a telegram ♪

399
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,980

where I've been ♪

400

00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,340

403
00:23:02,970 --> 00:23:04,120
Oh, well, hello.

404
00:23:04,121 --> 00:23:06,590
You must be Rebecca.

405
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:09,039
I'm Major Pedersen, your, uh, roommate.

406
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:10,560
Oh, pleased to meet you.

407
00:23:10,670 --> 00:23:13,980
And I'm delighted to see you
awake and dressed and ready.

408
00:23:14,150 --> 00:23:17,510
I thought you'd be too tired.
Too tired for what?

409
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:18,120
The Colonel didn't tell you?

410
00:23:18,121 --> 00:23:20,219
We do a women's clinic off the base.

411
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,980
Afghan women don't come
to the hospital, you see.

412
00:23:21,981 --> 00:23:23,690
They--they're afraid they'd be dishonored

413
00:23:23,691 --> 00:23:25,480
if they're seen by men
outside their family.

414
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:27,680
So the women from the
hospital, we go to them.

415
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,810
Actually, I am kinda tired.

416
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:34,009
Well, I mean, it's strictly volunteer,

417
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:35,200
but I was hoping.

418
00:23:35,201 --> 00:23:37,259
You see, we do get a lot
of physical problems

419
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:38,690
as well as the emotional ones.

420
00:23:38,691 --> 00:23:42,649
In fact, most of the women we
see are physically sick, so--

421
00:23:42,650 --> 00:23:44,229
Well, it stands to reason,

422
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,269
you'd see a lot of sick people in a clinic.

423
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:49,299
But I'm a psychiatrist, so--
but no worries.

424
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:52,220
If you're really too tired, I--

425
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:56,170
No. I'm not too tired. Of course I'll come.

426
00:23:57,450 --> 00:23:58,500
Great.

427
00:24:11,030 --> 00:24:13,690
Tape, some syringes--

428
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,280
Help you find something?

429
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,950
Uh, um, do we stock pregnancy test kits?

430
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,720
I never saw any. Why?

431
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,390
Well--

432
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,470
Don't some of the women
who come to the clinic

433
00:24:26,471 --> 00:24:28,460
want to know if they're pregnant?

434
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,699
I've never had an Afghan woman ask me that.

435
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:34,269
Well, suppose someone on the base

436
00:24:34,270 --> 00:24:35,760
thought she might be pregnant.

437
00:24:35,761 --> 00:24:39,200
Well, I suppose we would just
send a urine sample to the lab.

438
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,750
But what if she wanted it confidential?

439
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,720
They'd all want it to be confidential.

440
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,340
Sexual relations on the base
are against regulations.

441
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:54,190
If they were military, they'd be
sent home on the first plane.

442
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,920
Why do you ask?

443
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:00,610
Just a general question.

444
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,940
Uh, Rebecca Gordon,

445
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:05,799
This is Captain Mary Ann
Reith, our pharmacist.

446
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,120
Nice to meet you, but I didn't
see you, and you didn't see me.

447
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,710
I'm gonna get a coffee.
Lock up when you leave.

448
00:25:15,790 --> 00:25:17,400
Uh, what was that about?

449
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,140
This is one of those gray areas.

450
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:23,560
The top brass like it that
we run our women's clinic--

451
00:25:23,561 --> 00:25:24,400
hearts and minds and all--

452
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:27,930
But there's not exactly
a budget for supplies.

453
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,999
Wait. A-are you saying that they
want us to run a women's clinic,

454
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,470
but we have to steal the supplies?

455
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,270
Oh, not stealing, exactly.

456
00:25:36,470 --> 00:25:37,839
The Colonel calls it

457
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,150
"Requisitioning without paperwork."

458
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:42,280
A nice way to put it, don't you think?

459
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,740
Major Samizay to see you, sir. 
Okay.

460
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,890
Thank you for seeing me at once, Colonel.

461
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:02,619
Of course. What's the matter?

462
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,370
I believe the base is going to be attacked.

463
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:07,339
Fahran Nawabi-- the Taliban
we operated on just now?

464
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:09,450
Not just any Taliban.
He is the number three Taliban

465
00:26:09,451 --> 00:26:12,190
in all South Afghanistan.
It is all over Sky News.

466
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,200
There are rumors everywhere.

467
00:26:13,201 --> 00:26:15,900
That is why no women would
show up to the clinic today.

468
00:26:16,550 --> 00:26:19,010
The Taliban must know he is
being taken to this hospital.

469
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:22,080
They will lose respect if
they do not attack the base.

470
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:25,270
Graham.

471
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,550
Sir. Make sure TOC sends

472
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:29,729
this report up the chain, marked "Urgent."

473
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:30,870
Already done, sir.

474
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:32,020
Of course.

475
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:38,140
That was fast. Okay.

476
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,260
Graham, you know what to do. 
Yes, sir.

477
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:42,799
This is an attack warning. Take cover.

478
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,510
Put your flak jacket on.

479
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:47,600
Come on, soldier. Move it!

480
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,580
Let's go! To the bunker!

481
00:26:51,390 --> 00:26:53,580
Double time! Let's go! Move it!

482
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:57,420
Look, if he doesn't hold still,
I'm gonna have to sedate him.

483
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,170
Dude, gross!

484
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:05,650
Tell him to count backwards from ten.

485
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:13,820
He says to have sex with a--

486
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,020
With a what?

487
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:16,830
He didn't finish.

488
00:27:20,530 --> 00:27:21,660
And then the Captain says,

489
00:27:21,670 --> 00:27:24,380
"No, sir. It was only spaghetti."

490
00:27:26,250 --> 00:27:27,079
Conrad.

491
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,310
What's so funny?

492
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:30,940
You had to be there, ma'am.

493
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:33,860
I guess. Listen, you guys are
gonna have to go to the bunker.

494
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:36,429
Oh, come on, ma'am.

495
00:27:36,430 --> 00:27:39,930
We have our frag vests on.
We have our helmets. Sorry.

496
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:42,180
If my Colonel catches you
here during an attack,

497
00:27:42,181 --> 00:27:43,560
there'd be hell to pay.

498
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,910
Yes, ma'am.

499
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:48,640
I'll see you guys later.

500
00:27:48,641 --> 00:27:51,100
All right, man. See you later.
See you, man.

501
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:58,130
Where were you?

502
00:27:58,930 --> 00:28:00,370
I'm not allowed to pee?

503
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:03,730
How's our prisoner?
Did you hear that he's famous?

504
00:28:03,731 --> 00:28:06,930
Yeah, I heard.
Number three top Taliban in Kandahar.

505
00:28:07,090 --> 00:28:09,819
There might be a vacancy.
He's turning septic, and there's why.

506
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:12,609
Oh, holy crap.
How could I have missed that?

507
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:14,020
I was practically right there.

508
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,740
He's gotta go back into the O.R.

509
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,120
When the Colonel sees this,

510
00:28:17,121 --> 00:28:18,869
he's gonna ream my ass out good.

511
00:28:18,870 --> 00:28:20,510
What am I reaming your ass about?

512
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:23,880
That esophageal injury. I just--

513
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:26,200
I didn't know how I could've missed it.

514
00:28:27,930 --> 00:28:31,110
Well, they're easy to miss.
I missed it, too, remember?

515
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:34,600
So you're fine. No reaming today.

516
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:38,190
You want to take him or are you too tired?

517
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,270
You've both been going since you got here.

518
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:43,799
No, I'm fine, and, um, I'd like
to take him if that's okay.

519
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,980
Good. O.R. 1 is prepped and ready.

520
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,050
You can take him there.

521
00:28:47,470 --> 00:28:49,150
Bobby, you want to scrub in with her?

522
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:49,920
Happy to, sir.

523
00:28:49,921 --> 00:28:50,860
Good.

524
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:57,140
Not too tired for surgery?

525
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:00,200
I am never too tired for surgery.

526
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,140
Okay.

527
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:07,449
A little more retraction
on the pulmonary hilum.

528
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:08,780
Okay. How's that?

529
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,830
Good. B.P. is holding.

530
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,130
It can be a little nerve-racking.

531
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,470
They want you to take another one.

532
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,899
Oh, gosh. Battery.

533
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:58,320
Anyone got another camera?
My battery is dead.

534
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:11,489
Oh, holy crap.
I nicked the friggin' artery.

535
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,650
Clamp it.

536
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,710
Little slow on the uptake there.

537
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,570
You're welcome?

538
00:30:19,770 --> 00:30:21,650
I'm sorry, Bobby. 
Thank you.

539
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:24,999
New suture, please.
How much volume did we lose?

540
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,970
Can't have been much. B.P. is holding.

541
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:30,370
Thank God. That was a close one.

542
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,510
Nice shirt, man. I was there.

543
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,759
What? You saw the warped tour?

544
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:41,079
Yeah. Which one?

545
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:41,810
Last one--

546
00:30:41,811 --> 00:30:45,280
Asbury Park, New Jersey, summer '05, baby.

547
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,009
My Chemical Romance? The Offspring?

548
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:50,129
Oh, The Offspring was sick, dude.

549
00:30:50,130 --> 00:30:51,600
Oh, they had to cancel?

550
00:30:52,410 --> 00:30:56,119
No, no. Sick.
Oh, sick, like awesome.

551
00:30:56,120 --> 00:30:57,360
Wicked cool, you know? 
You know what?

552
00:30:57,361 --> 00:30:58,820
Don't teach him any more slang.

553
00:30:58,821 --> 00:31:00,880
We can barely understand him as it is.

554
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:05,040
- With all respect, pay no attention
to Commander Royal. - Oh.

555
00:31:05,450 --> 00:31:07,199
Conrad, who else did you see?

556
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,170
Avenged Sevenfold?

557
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:11,380
No, no, no.
We saw the Dropkick Murphys, yeah.

558
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:13,840
Hey, what is that, son?

559
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,370
Oh. Uh, it's-- it's nothing, sir.

560
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,180
Um, the frag vest absorbed the impact.

561
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:22,100
Didn't even break the skin.
Still, get it looked at.

562
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,960
Sure, sir, but really, it's nothing.

563
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,970
Yes, sir.

564
00:31:28,070 --> 00:31:30,710
All clear. The attack is over.

565
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:35,189

00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:17,150
I might just crash on the couch in here.

582
00:32:18,310 --> 00:32:19,970
All right. We're gonna try
to discuss that next time,

583
00:32:19,971 --> 00:32:24,440
but--oh, just in time
for the end of rounds.

584
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,920
Commander.

585
00:32:27,290 --> 00:32:29,440
All right. I'd like everyone
to take a look at this.

586
00:32:29,441 --> 00:32:31,660
This is a fresh shrapnel hole.

587
00:32:31,810 --> 00:32:34,000
You've seen these around
the building before.

588
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:35,220
In spite of the fact

589
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:38,340
that we are surrounded by
blast walls and containers--

590
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:40,369
In case you haven't noticed,

591
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:43,160
we are in a plywood and canvas building.

592
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:47,300
Yet there are still people
who are slow getting into--

593
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:50,660
their helmets and flak jackets.

594
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,240
Unacceptable.

595
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,880
Now I don't want to single
anyone out, but, Simon,

596
00:32:54,881 --> 00:32:58,380
what are you waiting for,
an engraved invitation?

597
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,960
Well, I'll, uh, make sure I'm
quicker next time, Colonel.

598
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,520
You do that.

599
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,630
Now for the rest of it,

600
00:33:07,631 --> 00:33:09,140
I was fairly satisfied.

601
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:14,099
Preoperative diagnosis as
revealed by the C.T. imaging

602
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:17,250
determined indications of an
upper anterior mediastinal--

603
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:24,160
Okay. Moving on.

604
00:33:24,590 --> 00:33:25,930
Oh, hi. 
Sorry. I'll come back.

605
00:33:25,931 --> 00:33:28,510
No, no, hey. Come here.

606
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,130
Rounds are over.

607
00:33:30,131 --> 00:33:32,510
All right. Everyone get some sleep.

608
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,150
We had a snake in the O.R. last night.

609
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,930
Snakes in the operating room?

610
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:40,190
That's ridiculous.

611
00:33:40,191 --> 00:33:42,999
Yeah? Graham. Get the snake.

612
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,050
Yes, sir.

613
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,250
And while he's getting the snake,

614
00:33:46,940 --> 00:33:49,710
I want to talk about the dust. 
Dust? I--

615
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,110
Hey, I was, um, I was wondering

616
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,270
if you wouldn't mind running a test for me.

617
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,709
The thing is, I don't have any paperwork.

618
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:03,060
Oh, that's no problem, doc.
What do you need?

619
00:34:03,310 --> 00:34:05,370
Just a basic pregnancy panel.

620
00:34:05,990 --> 00:34:07,160
It's for a friend.

621
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,460
She's military and doesn't
want to get sent home, so--

622
00:34:10,710 --> 00:34:11,860
Rest your mind, doc.

623
00:34:11,861 --> 00:34:14,389
Nothing from here ever
goes outside the Role 3

624
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:15,570
unless you say.

625
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,190
So you're feeling better?

626
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:22,360
They won't give me a card,
but your mom called.

627
00:34:22,361 --> 00:34:23,650
I think he's good to go to iso.

628
00:34:23,651 --> 00:34:24,600
Want to double-check?

629
00:34:24,601 --> 00:34:26,590
No, if you're happy, I'm happy.

630
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,180
All right. Ready?

631
00:34:34,950 --> 00:34:37,270
I'd say a real nice shaving cream.

632
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:40,620
You the surgeon?

633
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,170
Who wants to know? Dr. Trang?

634
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:46,790
Yeah. 
Dr. Trang?

635
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:50,170
Who are you, and where are the M.P.s?

636
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:53,620
We took over. When can he be moved?

637
00:34:53,850 --> 00:34:55,170
When he's well enough.

638
00:34:55,240 --> 00:34:56,760
When will that be, miss?

639
00:34:57,890 --> 00:35:00,069
It's Doctor or Major, not miss,

640
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:02,170
and he's well enough when I say so.

641
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:03,710
Rebecca, you got a sec?

642
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:06,040
Yeah, I'll be right there.

643
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:08,920
Any more questions?

644
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,460
No?

645
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:12,040
Then excuse me.

646
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,740
This is Dr. Gordon.
She's the one who saved your life.

647
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,079
Uh, no, it wasn't me. I just assisted.

648
00:35:23,080 --> 00:35:25,279
Thank him.
Well, what can I say, except, uh--

649
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,850
Don't look at me. It was her.

650
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,779
I just--I just--I'm so-- Dr. Trang
was your trauma team leader.

651
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:32,460
So if you want to thank
somebody, thank him. Thank her.

652
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:36,430
Well, uh, both of you, thank you.
I'm--I'm really--

653
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,339
Conrad! 
Oh, man. What's wrong?

654
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:40,400
No, back up.

655
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,249
I need Diazepam, 5 plus 5 I.M.,

656
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:45,960
then 1 gram phytoin over 20 minutes.

657
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:51,620
How close was he to the explosion?

658
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,310
Next to me, but he wasn't hurt.

659
00:35:53,311 --> 00:35:56,300
Was he unconscious at any point?
Only for a minute.

660
00:35:58,690 --> 00:35:59,740
What's going on?

661
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:05,389
Okay, we got blood in the belly, and lots.

662
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,819
Splenic rupture. We've got a blown pupil.

663
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:09,130
We need Dr. Hill.

664
00:36:09,570 --> 00:36:11,120
All right, he needs a C.T. scan right now. 
Call Dr. Hill!

665
00:36:11,121 --> 00:36:13,590
We gotta get him on a gurney.
What's happening?

666
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,360
He's been bleeding internally.

667
00:36:15,361 --> 00:36:18,940
But he was fine. He was fine.

668
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,630
More F.F.P.

669
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,460
Can we pull the curtain, please?

670
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,740
Cardiac arrest. Starting C.P.R.

671
00:36:52,360 --> 00:36:54,230
One one thousand. Two one thousand.

672
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,140
Three one thousand. Four one thousand.

673
00:36:56,141 --> 00:36:59,660
Five one thousand. Six one thousand.
Seven one thousand--

674
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,140
I don't think this brain
damage is survivable.

675
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:05,820
He's not clotting at all either.
O-2 sat 93% and falling.

676
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,580
Does anyone think there's
anything else we can do?

677
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,519
17 one thousand. 18 one thousand.

678
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:13,869
19 one thousand. 20 one thousand.

679
00:37:13,870 --> 00:37:14,620
21 one thousand.

680
00:37:14,621 --> 00:37:16,550
Okay. 22 one thousand. 23 one thousand.

681
00:37:16,551 --> 00:37:18,250
Stop C.P.R. 24--

682
00:37:21,820 --> 00:37:24,810
17 local time, Kandahar.

683
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,510
Let's take a moment.

684
00:37:44,010 --> 00:37:45,900
But I was the one that was hurt.

685
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,310
Okay? 
Not him. He was fine.

686
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:50,169
He wasn't, I'm sorry to say.

687
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:51,870
He thought he was, but he wasn't.

688
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:54,930
Maybe if we had gotten to him sooner--

689
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:56,880
I don't know.

690
00:37:57,780 --> 00:37:58,970
We're very sorry.

691
00:38:00,620 --> 00:38:02,420
I'm sure you did everything you could.

692
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:19,930
What the hell?

693
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:26,670
Attention!

694
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,270
Hut. Salute.

695
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:46,770
Colonel--

696
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:48,779
The Taliban prisoner's gone missing.
I heard.

697
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,850
No, he hasn't gone missing. He was taken.

698
00:38:52,510 --> 00:38:53,780
Why aren't you pissed off?

699
00:38:53,781 --> 00:38:55,880
I'm pissed off for the
same reason you are--

700
00:38:56,870 --> 00:38:58,560
that we lost that young soldier.

701
00:38:59,970 --> 00:39:02,020
I take it personally when we lose one.

702
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,080
I see that you do, too.

703
00:39:05,490 --> 00:39:06,090
But what about--

704
00:39:06,091 --> 00:39:07,770
That's my problem, not yours.

705
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,610
I'm on it.

706
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:14,380
Get some sleep.

707
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:15,940
That's an order.

708
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:16,950
Yes, sir.

709
00:39:20,610 --> 00:39:21,590
Hey.

710
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:24,980
I have completely lost track.
How long has it been?

711
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,080
Since we've been here?

712
00:39:26,081 --> 00:39:27,100
Yeah.

713
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:30,400
Let's see, it was night,
then day, then night--

714
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,820
Mm-hmm. I don't know. I've lost track, too.

715
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:36,200
Well, finally, we get to sleep.

716
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,500
Actually, there's one more thing.

717
00:39:39,150 --> 00:39:40,290
You're kidding me.

718
00:39:40,291 --> 00:39:41,380
No.

719
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:43,700
I don't really know what to do

720
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:46,670
except just to hand it to you.

721
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:51,100
The lab guy gave this to you?

722
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:52,700
To give to you, yes.

723
00:39:53,090 --> 00:39:55,340
Look, he was trying to get your attention,

724
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,640
but you were so focused
on finding the Colonel--

725
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:00,120
Anyway, he didn't mean anything by it,

726
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,070
you know, since it was for your friend.

727
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,120
You read it, naturally.

728
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:23,120
It wasn't exactly in a sealed envelope.

729
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:30,080
Well, you're the diagnostician.

730
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:32,479
And as I'm sure you've already figured out,

731
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:34,979
I thought that I might be pregnant,

732
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,180
and according to this, I am not.

733
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,490
I have never missed my period.

734
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:47,750
Okay, it could be one of
a few things or nothing.

735
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,220
A blood test will tell us.

736
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,470
Can you stay awake for another half-hour?

737
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:56,110
Honestly? No.

738
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,339
This is what I was worried about.

739
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,820
If it is anything else, I can wait.

740
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,850
The only thing that I care
about right now is sleep.

741
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:07,850
Yeah.

742
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,760
There!

743
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:25,670
Done! Over and out.

744
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,530
Remind me never to get on your wrong side.

745
00:41:28,531 --> 00:41:31,089
Oh, don't worry. I will. Night.

746
00:41:31,090 --> 00:41:32,100
Night.

747
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,250
9-1-1.

748
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,700
Oh, for the love of God!

749
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,280
Hurry up! Hurry up!

750
00:41:42,281 --> 00:41:45,050
We have five ambulances at the main gate!

751
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,460
You were right.

752
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,680
Nothing prepared me for this place.

753
00:41:56,681 --> 00:41:58,240
Yeah. Me neither.

754
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:01,720
What can I say? Welcome to Kandahar.
