1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,700
On this map, all the territory indicated
green is known as an act

2
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:33,800
"Louisiana Purchase," the area that is
Pres. Jefferson bought from Napoleon.

3
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:41,100
Today covers a large part of even 15
States, and even the part of Canada.

4
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:47,100
The area is more than twice
greater than the original 15 states.

5
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,300
But with this purchase,

6
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:56,100
inadvertently came the infamous pirate,
sea robber, Jean Lafitte.

7
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,100
If you were a little
patient, ladies and gentlemen,

8
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:05,300
could increase the pleasure
in a film that you will see,

9
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,200
if you know why
the Jean Lafitte ...

10
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,400
and his little insular
stronghold in Barataria Bay,

11
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:19,800
near the mouth of the Mississippi River, were so
important for both sides in the war 1812th whatever.

12
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,900
Nadiruaa English army knew
that they will control New Orleans

13
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,700
give control over the entire course of the river
Mississippi and bring certain victory.

14
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,600
England command stressed
access to New Orleans

15
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:39,800
the river is not an option.

16
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:45,000
But this network of water
roads, you see here,

17
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,300
called branches, which
is controlled by Jean Lafitte,

18
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,200
was the rear entrance
in New Orleans.

19
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,300
Both the British and the Americans
they knew

20
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:59,500
Lafitte the key. And what
this pirate do?

21
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,600
This, ladies and gentlemen,
our story.

22
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:49,300
<i> <font color=#2B60DE> MARINE robbers </ i>

23
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:55,100
<i> Jean Lafitte, the last sea robber and
still lives in the immortal words of Byron: </ i>

24
00:04:55,200 --> 00:05:01,100
<i> "He left a pirate name other times-
connected one virtue and thousands of crimes. "</ i>

25
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:07,000
<i> Three U.S. President condemned,
stroked and again condemned the pirates. </ i>

26
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:13,100
But Fate has put in the hands of this man
without a country, the fate of one,

27
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:18,400
United States, which fought for
own existence in the war 1812th I. ..

28
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:23,900
... Experienced defeat after defeat. Now
Only one man stood in defense,

29
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:29,800
to prevent a deadly Scorecard
shot - uneducated general,

30
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,000
the name of Andrew Jackson, with acicom hunters
the squirrels and inexperienced recruits.

31
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:20,100
Come on, boy. Over here.

32
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,200
No you will not do nothing.

33
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,800
You must be hungry.
Will one cookie?

34
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,200
Come on, boy.
Certainly good.

35
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,100
Better not look at the dog,
than a rifle, soldier.

36
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,100
Place it in your hands.

37
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,200
You are English?

38
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,300
If I had, you
would be dead.

39
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,000
How long were you in the military?
- From the day before.

40
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:53,000
Well, boy, how
do you feel?

41
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,300
A bit hungry.

42
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:00,500
You're not hungry until your stomach
not cleave along Kiem.

43
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,100
Hang on now that musket.

44
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,100
How long have you been with
Old eagle face?

45
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,500
I am old
Eagle face.

46
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,100
You? Andy Jackson himself?

47
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,800
The thought and me
sometimes scares.

48
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:26,400
How did someone like you get this
task? Now I can relax, right?

49
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,900
More krpa damn boots?
- Better them than your feet!

50
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,300
Andy, you're not coming here,

51
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,000
since you sent me to wander and gather
people in this chill. - I know, I know.

52
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,700
And you know, this is more difficult to tolerate when
these bones weaken. Sit down.

53
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,100
Here, have some fine
hot soup.

54
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,900
Thank you, Mr. Peavey!

55
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,500
Inside the waiting one officer. Came
and see all the way from Washington.

56
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:00,900
Why did not you say so?

57
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,600
He did not say it was an emergency,
only official visit.

58
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,700
What's the news? To
ease, Captain.

59
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,000
Captain Wilkes, I come in the name of
President Maddison, sir.

60
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,300
The English won Washington.
They burned the capital and the White House.

61
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,200
The President is safe?
- He got away, sir.

62
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,000
But the next few weeks,

63
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:27,000
government will be monitored from
President's saddle horse.

64
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,800
We pray that this
horse does not stumble.

65
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:34,100
The fate of the country in
your hands, General.

66
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,600
England invading fleet
sent to New Orleans.

67
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
On ships have
16,000.

68
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,900
16th ..?

69
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,900
They expect them to stop S. ..?

70
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,100
Here we have 1,200 people,

71
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,500
and most of these boys does not
shoes, let alone a man. How do I ...?

72
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,900
New Orleans?

73
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,500
Obviously here we have more
chickens, but soldiers.

74
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:05,100
Move it.

75
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,700
Let's see.

76
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:13,200
If you control the Mississippi,
will keep this country by the throat.

77
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:19,500
Maybe we could
set up a defense here.

78
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,100
And there.
- Not there.

79
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,000
Why not you?
- It's Barataria.

80
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,800
Each piece of the swamp
controls Lafitte, the pirate.

81
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,600
From New Orleans to the Gulf.
First we have to agree with him.

82
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:35,000
Agree? With a pirate?

83
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,300
What kind of deal,
We will hang him.

84
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,100
Trying to hang him
already 10 years.

85
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:44,600
When Andy talks about hanging,
you should see a rope.

86
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:50,100
<i> JEAN LAFITTE provides a rare
opportunity - without taxes </ i>

87
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:53,000
<i> MARKET seven seas. </ i>

88
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:58,400
Go ahead, scroll. All you
welcome to the market Jean Lafittea.

89
00:09:58,700 --> 00:10:02,000
Without taxes. No additional charges
the war was lost.

90
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,600
Come on, we cleaned the deck.
Well, what have you got there?

91
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:09,000
Gentlemen, this is a real
Spanish lace!

92
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,700
How exciting!

93
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,200
It looks like it's from the harem. So-
you will not feel like a sultan.

94
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,700
Take care of gentlemen.

95
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,100
Gentlemen, what is life
without the right spices?

96
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,700
Me personally this is the King of France
asked to sell on his behalf.

97
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,300
Apparently the King of France
has a bad taste.

98
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,700
Ma'am, this is a fine piece of the picture.
He just needs a little polishing.

99
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,800
What, you do not like children?

100
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,400
Mobi, eaerna cane.

101
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:40,700
Pickpocket.

102
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Mobi! eaerna cane.

103
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,400
Hello, General.

104
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:49,700
When you steal the sea,
Then you sea robber.

105
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,500
When you steal the
land, then you are a thief.

106
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:59,000
Mobile, Mobile, eaerna cane.

107
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,900
Excuse me, sir. I
you dropped your wallet.

108
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,100
Thank you!

109
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,100
I did not expect that
the pirate ... - What?

110
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,600
I wanted to say, thank you.

111
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,000
General Dominique?

112
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,000
Good afternoon, madam.

113
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:31,000
I brought you
something as a souvenir.

114
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,100
Oh, that's nice. Thank you.

115
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,900
For beauty, honor.

116
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:43,500
It gave me the car in Austerlitz.

117
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:50,400
General, you should not have.
Really should not have.

118
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,400
Bonnie, give me the money, not
belong to either you or your father.

119
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,100
Move it. You know that half
every dollar goes Lafitteu.

120
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:03,700
Just try to take it,
I'll rip your belly.

121
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:06,300
Look, Bonnie, half
belongs to the boss.

122
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,000
Keep your claws out
ocevog of cargo!

123
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:13,400
If you were not the daughter of Captain
Brown, I'd ...

124
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,800
You what?
- Bitch one!

125
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,400
Who pushed Bonnie?
- I am.

126
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,100
Move, Dominique,
I'll kill that filthy squid.

127
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:32,800
Dame can not beat with a broken
bottles. - I do not have a sword.

128
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,000
Bring it on!

129
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,100
It was Jean Lafitte!

130
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,400
Go get 'em!

131
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,800
Ladies and gentlemen, this is
the end of our little show.

132
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,500
We hope you
enjoy the show.

133
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:14,600
Let it be
just a hint of what,

134
00:13:15,400 --> 00:13:18,800
we went through, we find
brought treasures Seven Seas.

135
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:24,100
We take the risk,
and you bargain.

136
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:26,300
Thanks, Lafitte.

137
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,600
Thank you, Mr. Lafitte, exceptional
performance, as always.

138
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,900
Thank you all, gentlemen.

139
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,600
Hey!
- What is it?

140
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,200
Why not nauci handled scissors
cutting as you handle a knife?

141
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,700
Governor's daughter. What
you think you doing here?

142
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:53,200
You do not think
came to buy?

143
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Miss Claiborne!

144
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:59,000
Good day, madame Mercier,
I'm glad to see you.

145
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,000
Let's go guys, run it.

146
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,800
Now everyone can show appreciation,
so a little more open wallet.

147
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:11,400
Goodbye.

148
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,300
My dear, we are very honored
your distinctive prisutnoau.

149
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,700
Better not tell her husband
where you purchased this scarf.

150
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,200
Mr. Lafitte, never say.

151
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,200
Actually her and you can not blame him.

152
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,100
He's a pirate.

153
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:35,700
You'll see why
my hands are tied.

154
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,500
Sales of goods without taxes,
signed by Jean Lafitte.

155
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,900
How to gather taxes, when half
New Orleans business with these pirates.

156
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,000
There must be a way, they are breaking the law.
- We can not arrest the whole town.

157
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,200
It is true that, in fact,
nobody cares.

158
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,300
Nobody wants to pay taxes
in a war that we are losing.

159
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:59,700
If you think so, sir. Phipps,
maybe you need to resign.

160
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,400
I am a loyal American, sir.

161
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,800
Okay, okay, we have
Lafittea today in shackles.

162
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:12,400
Annette.

163
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,700
I did not ask to
fall in love with you.

164
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,300
After I
first saw you,

165
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:25,300
I had thought to be 4 months
knowing that we'll be out of sight.

166
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,700
Neither typhoons or hurricanes, and not
could erase from my mind.

167
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,400
And you came back here.

168
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,900
What I thought might be
just a dream, you've done stvarnoau.

169
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,900
Now you say it's over.

170
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,300
Jean,

171
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,300
my father is here
sent to the President,

172
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:50,000
to this country
brought a kind of unity.

173
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,600
And I, behold, there

174
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:59,800
in love with a man, which can destroy
all that my father is trying to build.

175
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,000
Who, me?
- Yes, you.

176
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:06,000
I feel like I'm
on the side of the enemy.

177
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,300
Half my people we are jumping the neck, because they
do not allow attacking U.S. ships.

178
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,500
Love for you
it cost me a lot of money.

179
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,800
Jean ...

180
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,200
It's not about what you do not do,
already about what they should.

181
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:24,200
We are losing the war. Englishmen
just burned Washington.

182
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,500
What does it matter to us?

183
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,000
New Orleans might be next.

184
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:32,600
New Orleans had three different
Flags in the last 15 years.

185
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:37,000
It does not matter what will be
and fourth. - It is important to me.

186
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:45,000
You do not know what it means
belong to a country.

187
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,400
You want a country?
I'll give it to you.

188
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,800
You can have Barataria.

189
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,600
Barataria?

190
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:56,300
Barataria's kingdom
a thousand fighters.

191
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:59,500
Ships that sail
Gulf and Caribbean.

192
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:04,100
Do you know what they offer
King of Barataria?

193
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:08,300
$ 500
dead or alive.

194
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,200
It will not charge it.

195
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:15,100
Jean, a girl must be proud
on his love, do not be ashamed of it.

196
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:19,100
How can I tell people that I love
man, who is the head of a price?

197
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:20,900
You're just not ...

198
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,500
What did not?
Say it.

199
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,800
You are not worthy of respect.

200
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,900
Worthy of respect.

201
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,800
What do you want the code
weapons, not a man.

202
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,700
I want a man with a feeling of
honor, duty and loyalty.

203
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,800
Not savages. -Savage you
was not good enough,

204
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,700
when you needed breath of fresh air in
your boring social life.

205
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,500
My life may be boring,

206
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:48,500
but 'barato' continues
means cheap.

207
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,000
I think it's better to
get back to the carriage.

208
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:16,100
Too late, gentlemen. Just
You missed a good opportunity.

209
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:19,100
Hooch, set the best
archers on those trees.

210
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,100
Blue, cover the bridge.

211
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:28,700
We can take them, boss. - No
shooting. I do not want trouble.

212
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:36,000
Come on. Quick!

213
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,900
Now you will see,
Governor.

214
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:09,100
I swear, sir, there are people Lafitteovi
maintain sales an hour ago.

215
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,600
I know, I know.

216
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,900
I'm glad, Governor.
- You look funny, sir.

217
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,200
Governor, you
I did not expect!

218
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:22,400
Obviously, madame.

219
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,200
Can you explain,
Ladies and Gentlemen,

220
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,400
why do you find in this
beznacajnoj swamp,

221
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:31,300
hands full
krijumcarenih things.

222
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:35,900
Even my own daughter.
- Excuse me. Father, I ...

223
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,000
You're looking good
bargain, Miss?

224
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,800
Governor!

225
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,900
Looking for something special?

226
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,900
I ask you!
Mr. Phipps?

227
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,600
Yes, sir.
- Read my manifesto.

228
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:52,500
I'm offering $ 500 reward

229
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,100
to capture Jean Lafittea.

230
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,700
$ 500? That's new.
- Dead or alive.

231
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:01,500
William CC Claiborne,
Governor Louis'.

232
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,100
I, Jean Lafitte,
I offer 10 thousand dollars

233
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,800
Hearing Governor Claiborne.

234
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,500
Lieutenant!

235
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,100
Capture this man!
- Carefully, Governor.

236
00:20:15,300 --> 00:20:17,200
You are not at home.

237
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,600
Governor!

238
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:22,700
One hundred guns were directed
to you at this moment.

239
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:27,500
It is better not to take risks,
Governor, people can get hurt.

240
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,500
Just the fear that someone
of you to be hurt,

241
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,400
inhibit me that this pirate
immediately brought to justice.

242
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:38,100
Sir, I'm a pirate.
Pirate.

243
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,300
You laugh!
I just laugh!

244
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,300
Did not realize that
your country is at war?

245
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,400
Will you laugh and
when the British march,

246
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,400
and you you do not have any
State or the flag?

247
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:54,500
And you! Will you laugh
when General Jackson rides

248
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,600
and expel you and your koljace
out of Barataria?

249
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,900
And others have tried before.

250
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,400
It will be differently
with Jackson.

251
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,000
He swore to you that there is no
places under the American flag.

252
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,900
I'm truly sorry
to hear that, Governor.

253
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,000
I've always respected
American flag.

254
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,400
Miss, are you coming?

255
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,100
I'm not looking for trouble.

256
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:44,300
While with me,
she's a lady.

257
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,800
It's a lady!

258
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,900
Come, come, fix
I will you. You're next.

259
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:53,800
I do not know how to swim.
I've got to get him out.

260
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,200
Cowards.

261
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,900
There were days when I could
handle ten of these at once.

262
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:03,000
If you were not so drunk
I would beat you up.

263
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,000
Okay, okay.

264
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,100
These punks down there!
- Who are you yelling?

265
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:16,500
On you! Now get out before
than you send patrol.

266
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,500
Who do you nare?uje?

267
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,700
I was a ship's captain
before you. Get down!

268
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:28,400
Come on, fatty. - Stop it, Paul.
- Come on, I'll fix you, too!

269
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,900
Shut up, Paul!
- Stop it, honey.

270
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,400
These rats here
they first began.

271
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,200
Yes, he would not hurt a fly!
- They insulted my lady.

272
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,000
You must be blind.

273
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,300
This monster, lady?

274
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:44,900
Who are you calling ...
- Get out of that and do not carve.

275
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,100
Mr. Brown, you will allow
to discuss this with me?

276
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,600
Bonnie is right.
You monster. Erase.

277
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,400
It is a case
with the lady.

278
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,100
Come on, Paul.

279
00:22:57,300 --> 00:23:01,900
You should have seen me, Bonnie. Arranged
I have four of, yet I used fists.

280
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:05,100
Why do not you use the on Lafitteu?
Instead of those rats.

281
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,600
I'll choose the time.
Come on, let's go have a drink.

282
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,900
And, no, you will not.
You've got sloshed.

283
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,000
Only one.
- Get back to the ship.

284
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:15,700
Here comes another one.
- Everybody stand back. Be careful.

285
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,000
Keep them away from the line.

286
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,700
Sale.
- Come on, Paul.

287
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,800
Before you
gets in your mouth.

288
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:26,200
Come here.
Look at that.

289
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,800
U.S. ships that
Lafitte never attacks.

290
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:31,800
And what happens? All
Gold from New Orleans

291
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,600
He slipped through the hands to
those Yankee falcon.

292
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,300
Lucky charm.

293
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,900
Buy lucky charm
and long live.

294
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,300
Passengers for Corinthian,
Embark.

295
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,600
Take care, boarding burden.

296
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,100
Just a little, please.
- You can not let them. - Yes, sir.

297
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:15,400
But now it's all yours,
Captain Carruthers.

298
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,900
Sign here and download
governor consignment for safekeeping.

299
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:23,500
I'd rather have the burden of cobras,
but the devil's bait.

300
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,000
Already has enough trouble with the lock.
- Maybe you mist be walked on hand.

301
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,500
Mr. Miggs.

302
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,900
You just give us
a few minutes?

303
00:24:33,100 --> 00:24:35,000
Yes, sir.
- Good.

304
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,300
Give a signal to visitors
go ashore.

305
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:42,400
All visitors to the coast.

306
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:47,800
I never thought I'd
you see that keep a child.

307
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,000
I wish you luck.
- It will take me.

308
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,400
Marie!
- Annette.

309
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,100
What are you doing here?

310
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,800
I found a message that you left your father.
You're coming home with me, now.

311
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,600
Sorry, Annette.

312
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:12,700
It goes with me
Spain. We'll be married.

313
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,300
Stay out of it, Antonio.

314
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,400
Annette, manage fathers
life, but do not mine.

315
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,200
She will not listen to reason,
Antonio, maybe you will.

316
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,900
I talked to your father, says that
we need to wait until the war is not to wind up.

317
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,600
And I I will not wait!

318
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,700
Stop, think
only upon himself.

319
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,900
It makes no sense to talk with her, Antonio.
He knows all about how to be a lady.

320
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:36,000
But nothing about it
how to be a woman.

321
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,600
You're probably right.

322
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,600
Ah, Marie.

323
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,000
Annette, please
did not think so.

324
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:49,900
Very nice, but ... - Annette,
I'm sorry. - It should not be so separate.

325
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:52,200
Annette, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

326
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,900
If you do not want to sail with us, you must
leave. - Okay, now I'm leaving.

327
00:25:56,200 --> 00:26:00,300
Okay, you two, I'll figure out
How do I tell my father. Beware it.

328
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:03,900
Look, just do not
thought. Will you catch cold!

329
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,900
Visitors to the coast,
sail.

330
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,400
I wish I could
be at your wedding.

331
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,200
Annette, I had
time purchase wedding dress,

332
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,500
so I borrowed your
new dress.

333
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,300
Which one? - What you sewed
Madame de Dupre.

334
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:28,800
Of white crepe?

335
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,100
I'm sorry.

336
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,200
Annette!
- Yes?

337
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:39,100
I took my mom and brooch!
- Did you leave me anything?

338
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:42,200
Yes, father.

339
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,000
Then, Rumbo? Have you caught
that the Portuguese galleon?

340
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:06,800
The English is the
first docepali.

341
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
And you Flint,
What did you catch?

342
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:13,200
Ten pounds of iron in the trunk.
Well that did not sink.

343
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:16,700
The boss does not like him
Captains of returning empty-handed.

344
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,200
We will convene Captain's Council ...

345
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,700
boss may not be long head.

346
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,600
It is time to ask
few questions Lafitteu.

347
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:28,600
Sure you want to respond?
Maybe they get.

348
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:34,100
Trouble on the horizon, Pyke.

349
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,900
But why stay in Barataria?

350
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,300
Listen to me! Jackson
We send out comes.

351
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:43,300
And the English blockade
We were there close.

352
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,800
And you do not give us immersed
U.S. ships.

353
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,700
I say, let's send 100 boats to sink,
pick up values ??and

354
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,900
let's go to New Orleans,
before Jackson arrived.

355
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,600
I agree. - Jean,
listen to their captain.

356
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,100
We the people must,
back to him.

357
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,100
Now we have more dealers
from the beach, but the pirates.

358
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:05,100
What impedes us to stay in
Barataria, and roll back to Jackson?

359
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,100
Our children were born here.

360
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,700
Hut on the beach is the only home
which many will know.

361
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,000
If we go from Barataria,
I'll lose Carribu.

362
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,900
And I'm Tina.

363
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,200
Sailor's home is
deck beneath his feet.

364
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,000
And why are you wearing a bag
French country around the neck?

365
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:21,300
This, Mr Pyke,

366
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:25,000
reminds me of all the lies,
to talk about the country.

367
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:28,600
Majcica country, fathers
country, country.

368
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,600
All this is just a country,
which will bury you.

369
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,300
A shed
blood defending it.

370
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,500
I say that
belong to the sea.

371
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:39,500
Man belongs there,
Where do you want to belong.

372
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:41,800
I do not like when I push against.

373
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,500
Neither Claiborne nor Jackson,
or Englishmen or more!

374
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,300
Wait, I want to say something.

375
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,300
Here, Miguel.

376
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:54,300
I forgot.

377
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,100
Boss, may I speak?

378
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,200
Already has enough
unimportant been told.

379
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:05,000
This is Scipiov home.
Just say it.

380
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:08,000
I know the law, boss.
I can not dislodge.

381
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:11,000
Law? What law?

382
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:13,600
I do not remember, sir, boss?
I was told,

383
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:16,100
The law on human rights.

384
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,700
Ah, there it is. Regulations
U.S. Declaration.

385
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:23,500
That all men are
are created equal.

386
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:26,200
We are equal in Barataria.
- Silence!

387
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:29,700
I want to hear the rules.
Continue, Scipio.

388
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,200
That their Creator
determined given rights.

389
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,500
Inalienable rights.

390
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:38,500
Thank you. -What are these rights?

391
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,500
So to give them
no one can take away!

392
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,600
While no one came
with more artillery.

393
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,400
That's it!
- Okay, okay!

394
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:49,600
Thank you, gentlemen.
Continue, Scipio!

395
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,700
Life, liberty and
the achievement of happiness.

396
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,400
It is better than ours
Law Fraternity.

397
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:57,900
We tell no
guarantee happiness.

398
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,900
None of these
rules is not for us.

399
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:08,100
They are Americans. - Barataria
The U.S. is, is not it? - Of course!

400
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:13,800
As long as we
this pile of sand,

401
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,000
we have all the rights
that we guarantee.

402
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,200
Nobody has the right to evict.

403
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:22,700
That's right, boss.
- Nonsense!

404
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,100
Of all of these bljezgarija
Freedom and rights me sick.

405
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:31,000
He says he wants to stay
and be Americans.

406
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:36,100
Do not lie,
said to you.

407
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,300
This is the only America,
to which he cared.

408
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,600
He's right.
- Stay out of it, Bonnie.

409
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:45,300
My father was the best
water you've ever had.

410
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,700
And while all of you are here chatting,

411
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,600
He went for cargo, valuable
quarter of a million dollars in gold.

412
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:53,900
What are you talking about?

413
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:58,300
For months there was no ship
Treasure at a distance of 150 km.

414
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,900
Gold transferred from New Orleans,
right in front of you.

415
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:05,700
The only ship that sailed from the
port last week was Corinthian.

416
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,200
Sailed before two nights.

417
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,700
Corinthian? He
the U.S., boss.

418
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,400
No one shall order my
father who ship to attack.

419
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,500
Least Lafitte.

420
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:19,800
My father had his own fleet,
while you fought for scraps.

421
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,200
No longer betray
orders, Lafitte.

422
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,700
Now it works
Captain Brown.

423
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,700
Flint, Captain Rumbo,
on their ships.

424
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:32,100
Slowly, Jean,

425
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:37,000
quarter of a million is a significant prey.
- We will follow the one who returned.

426
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,600
Right.

427
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,600
I'll take Ravena and crew'll
congregate on the beach, if I have to.

428
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,800
Jean, you're still the boss. And I
I still assistant.

429
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,500
I do not like to miss a good fight.

430
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,000
Just pray that
Retrieve your father,

431
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:53,500
before it touches
the American ship.

432
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:12,300
I see a ship. Approaching
the. Could be Vulci.

433
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,200
What do you see, Dominique?

434
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:16,600
Two boats.

435
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:20,400
One is Vulci.
- And the other?

436
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,000
All hands on deck.

437
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:49,600
For this it is worth
shed a little blood.

438
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Quarter of a million dollars.

439
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,700
We'll see.
- Vraaajte up!

440
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,700
Vraaajte up!

441
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,600
Come on, look alive a bit.
Get it. Faster.

442
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,700
Come on. Hurry.

443
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,000
Is it fixed properly, Gramby?

444
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:12,500
Yes, Captain. Raises
easily as a puff box.

445
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,000
Good!

446
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:18,600
Enough promises, Brown. Let's open
and see of which has inutra.

447
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,100
It will be later
time for that.

448
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:25,500
We have to go, you do not burn the ship.
Diego, release all the ropes.

449
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,600
All return to the ship.
- We all go back to the ship!

450
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,400
Disengage the hooks.
- Disengage the hooks!

451
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,900
Burn it, Chighizola.

452
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:53,800
Gramby, be ready to fire a salvo
the hull. We do not want to leave evidence.

453
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:57,300
Yes, Captain.
Prepare top No. 1

454
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:02,700
Hey, Brown? Are you
saw the Torah on board?

455
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,900
Come here, Mouse,
Before you crisp-fried.

456
00:34:06,700 --> 00:34:08,600
Catch this.
Toro!

457
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,900
Come on, Mouse,
come here.

458
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:14,900
Toro Toro. Idiot
silly, where are you?

459
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:18,100
Move the boat to
We are caught by fire.

460
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,000
Jump, Mouse, leaped.

461
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,600
Fire unit.

462
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:37,100
It would break his ribs.

463
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,000
Goodbye, Corinthian.

464
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,800
Captain, what is the Toro!

465
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,600
Leave the bags and
Hop, stupid.

466
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,700
What do you want?

467
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,700
What the hell are waiting for?
Jump!

468
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,300
When you try to work on next time
kill, I'll kill you myself.

469
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,300
Prepare to
firing twos.

470
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:27,000
Because you two are almost burned.
It is better that the loot is worth something.

471
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,100
What are you doing?

472
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,900
You can not do that.

473
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,700
You know that Brown does not allow
private property.

474
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,900
What are you trying?
Get a knife in the throat?

475
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,100
What have you got there?
Necklaces?

476
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,100
We sear the third for good luck.

477
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:53,000
Sobo, prepare three.
- Yes, Captain.

478
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,200
Even the one waiting there.

479
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,700
Fire!

480
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,000
Hans?
Yes, boss?

481
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:06,400
Prepare for
switch. - Yes, boss.

482
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:10,400
Arm yourself for boarding.
Prepare hooks to capture.

483
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,600
Lights out.
- Lights out!

484
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:28,800
Do not waste too much of the rum, waiting
We have a lot of sea. - Yes, Captain.

485
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:32,500
About which they are arguing about towels?

486
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:37,700
They just fit. - Enough
svakakvog trash. - Hey, Brown!

487
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,800
This is the amulet, which
someone did not bring happiness.

488
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:50,900
Hey, Brown!

489
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,400
Hey, Captain, do you find this
music does not break my heart?

490
00:36:54,700 --> 00:36:57,800
Just not feeling.
What have you got here?

491
00:36:58,500 --> 00:37:01,800
Look, wedding dress.

492
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,600
Do not I look nice?

493
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:09,800
Neither barracuda would not marry you.
- Kiss the bride. And you get lice?

494
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,800
Open it!

495
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:16,400
What is Gramby?
Do not believe me?

496
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,200
View of gold returns
man faith, Captain.

497
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,800
Inside is a quarter of a million
dollars. - We want to see the gold!

498
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:26,200
Well, open.

499
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,900
The thought of these gold
shaking hands, Gramby?

500
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:39,300
Open it, Gramby.
- Open up!

501
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,800
Just as I told you!

502
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,200
True, Captain.
It paid off.

503
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,600
K itself hands.
Move it!

504
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:50,200
You've seen gold. USA
return to positions.

505
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,400
You heard the captain.

506
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,100
Save it before
These sharks go crazy.

507
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,400
What do you have, Deacon?

508
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:02,800
Slightly more valuable than all of your
glittering cunning devil.

509
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:06,900
Books.
- Pirate who reads books.

510
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:09,600
At least this is my boss will not mind.

511
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:14,100
You're looking at the head, Deacon!

512
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:18,000
Yes, I see.

513
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:20,200
What happened to
you, Tim?

514
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,000
I lost my ear
in battle, Captain.

515
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,900
Anyway, there is nothing to hear.

516
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,700
Oh, I do not care about listening to
ear I had a diamond ring.

517
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:30,700
Five pieces a month, regular
income, real brotherhood.

518
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:35,200
What are our losses? - 4 killed
2 missing and 4 wounded.

519
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,500
Enough, six dead.

520
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,600
Seven.

521
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,400
Accounts and you, Mr. Brown.

522
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:46,600
Because I'm going to hang you.

523
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,700
You're not one you
hang Lafitte!

524
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,500
Quickly lose
friends, Mr. Brown.

525
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:01,600
Is there anyone else on the
his side?

526
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:04,700
Jean! You always
called fair.

527
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:08,100
Give him a chance. - Is he gave
people a chance to Corinthian?

528
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:10,600
The boat rescue
Worse deck.

529
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,700
You knew my orders.

530
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:21,000
All people trapped
board are left alive.

531
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:27,300
Gramby? You're his assistant.

532
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,900
You had a hand in this? -He received
I have orders from his captain.

533
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,400
Your captain more
will not issue orders.

534
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,200
Jean! You can hang them all.

535
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,100
I guess I do not keep the entire crew
responsible for the actions of one man?

536
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:43,900
I'm not so wide of the heart
as a general. Then, Gramby?

537
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,400
Brown or follow me?

538
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:49,200
You.
- You ... what?

539
00:39:52,300 --> 00:39:54,400
You, boss!

540
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:59,700
All right.

541
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,400
Hang him.

542
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,000
Gramby, do not!

543
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,800
Jack, Tiny, deacon, hold.

544
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,800
Not me.

545
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,000
Gramby!

546
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:37,200
What are you mumbling, Deacon?

547
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:39,900
Prayer for a dying ship.

548
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:48,800
Dominique, set a course for
Barataria. Full sail.

549
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:51,100
Positions!

550
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,700
All in their places!

551
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:57,200
Spread your sails!

552
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,400
Beluche, signal Raven
let go of us.

553
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:11,900
Yes, General.

554
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,400
Where did he come from?

555
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:26,600
With Corinthian. My friend Toro
he risked his life to save this brat.

556
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,600
I now feel that the
a saint?

557
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,300
A saint who will save us?

558
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,900
It's a boy with Corinthian! - From
looked at him, I get chills.

559
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,100
He is the only witness
all that.

560
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,400
Too small to throw back.
- He can hang us all.

561
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:41,800
Not too small to speak.

562
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:45,900
"Bad luck."

563
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:48,600
If you ask me, he
hodajuaa death penalty.

564
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:51,000
Just have killed.

565
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,600
It is better to kill him.

566
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:02,200
Deacon. Better
pray for us.

567
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:23,400
Everybody move.
Unleash mol.

568
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:28,200
Okay, continue to
beach. Do not stop the boat.

569
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,800
Same goes for buyers
in Nosperovo warehouse.

570
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:35,200
Why we do not want
tell me what happened?

571
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,600
My mouth can not pronounce
what my eyes saw.

572
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,300
Come on, do not stay.

573
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:47,000
Hey, what you got there?
- Personal belongings.

574
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,000
They hanged Brown!

575
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,300
They hanged Brown.
They hanged Brown!

576
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:58,800
Hey?
- What is it?

577
00:43:01,100 --> 00:43:02,600
What's this?

578
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:07,300
This is my dear mother, Pyke!
- You've never had a mother!

579
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,800
Since when do you betray
orders, Pyke?

580
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,500
And why not share
booty on the beach, as always?

581
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,300
Do not provoke trouble today,
because you'll pass as Brown.

582
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:22,800
Captain Rumbo!

583
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,000
Do not!

584
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,500
Come on, boy!

585
00:43:34,600 --> 00:43:36,500
This dork is a Corinthian?

586
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:38,500
Your friend Brown
left two survivors.

587
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,100
Boy and his dog.
Come on, son.

588
00:43:44,900 --> 00:43:47,000
Well, at least the dog
can talk.

589
00:43:48,100 --> 00:43:50,200
Coming reason
do not share the spoils.

590
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,400
One move the knife
will take care of it.

591
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,800
Do you need help, General?
- No, it is not necessary.

592
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:57,300
Too seen.

593
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,300
He is the Corinthian, is not it?

594
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:05,100
Do you want to go with you, boss?
- Lafitte, me and the other captains ...

595
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:13,000
I'm glad you
back, boss.

596
00:44:13,300 --> 00:44:16,600
And to me, sir, boss. - Are
heard of Brown? - Yes.

597
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:20,000
Hello, boss.
Would you like shrimp?

598
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,100
Hold it.

599
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,800
Let her go, Beluche!

600
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,600
Well you, boss?

601
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:40,700
I am. She could not
hit a boat with an ax.

602
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:43,900
Dirty, smelly killer.
- Your father got what he deserved.

603
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:46,400
People under my leadership
consuming burden, not lives.

604
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:50,900
It is all that remains of
crew and passengers with Corinthian.

605
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:55,500
Brown killed everybody's right to
fall under the U.S. flag.

606
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,600
Only one flag for rights
all of us, black as your heart.

607
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,900
He did not even slightly
care for your people.

608
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,000
Just for the chance that you
lost the governor's daughter.

609
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,600
Bonnie is right.

610
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:11,000
We are not interested to become
Americans, like you, Lafitte.

611
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,200
We are interested only
division of spoils.

612
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:16,900
This little one is between
us and a quarter million in gold.

613
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,300
Listen, Lafitte. One
language is as bad as the 20 more

614
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,900
You, sharks,
are you hungry?

615
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:25,600
It is simple. Lafittte to become
America, we want to share the gold.

616
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,700
Cut the neck brat.

617
00:45:34,300 --> 00:45:37,800
Okay, Gramby, you
do it.

618
00:45:39,700 --> 00:45:41,500
Flint?

619
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,300
Rumbo, do you?

620
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:50,200
Well, Bonnie,
knife is yours, give you.

621
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:53,200
Only one throat
I want to cut.

622
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:03,500
Come on, boy. Go to the boss
house, with it you'll be safe.

623
00:46:04,700 --> 00:46:06,900
Well, get out!

624
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:09,800
Already you have shown
his courage.

625
00:46:38,100 --> 00:46:39,600
What do you want?

626
00:46:40,100 --> 00:46:42,900
Find out what you will
with me, sir.

627
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,200
I do not know.

628
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:55,100
Why are you standing there?
If you're gonna come in, come.

629
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:58,100
I can not go into the captain's
chambers without permission, sir.

630
00:46:58,600 --> 00:47:01,300
I said, Come.
- Thank you, sir.

631
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,100
You stay here, kid.
Stay.

632
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,000
Everyone would be better to
I threw alligators.

633
00:47:19,600 --> 00:47:22,600
But it would not be just
a mouthful, is not it?

634
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:30,100
Yes, sir.
I mean, no, sir.

635
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:34,900
Are you hungry?
- No, sir!

636
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,900
Well, not too much.

637
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:43,600
What's your name, boy?
- Miggs, sir.

638
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:48,000
How long have you run out of
cab? - All my life.

639
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:53,400
It's a long time.
What can you do?

640
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,000
I know darn well sails.
- I was in the house.

641
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,000
I have never lived in the house.
- Sit down and eat.

642
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:03,900
Thank you, sir.

643
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:14,600
There's nothing special
about the house.

644
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:18,800
It's just a body,
in dry dock.

645
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:22,900
All my life dream to have a house,

646
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:26,100
and when he get yourself, then
is on the wrong street.

647
00:48:26,900 --> 00:48:28,400
Yes, sir!

648
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:33,200
Do not always agree with
me, unless you really do not know.

649
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,400
I do not call anyone "sir."

650
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,600
Apart from someone who
You can appreciate.

651
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:39,700
Yes, sir!

652
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,100
What are you staring, Miggs?

653
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,900
Very nice lady, sir.

654
00:48:57,500 --> 00:48:59,300
Yes ...

655
00:49:01,700 --> 00:49:03,300
It is a very expensive box.

656
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:15,200
Coming troops, Jean.
Enter into Barataria Bay.

657
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,600
Americans?
- I do not see the flag.

658
00:49:17,900 --> 00:49:21,000
They come with open guns.
There had to be Corinthian.

659
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:24,500
Guns on the wall facing the sea. - Already
are. Watch out for the kid. - Yes, sir.

660
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,600
People with guns.
- In places are.

661
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,000
Release cannon openings.

662
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:35,300
Do not shoot!

663
00:49:37,300 --> 00:49:40,200
What do you see, Pyke? -Ordered
in battle formation, boss.

664
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:43,600
It will be action.
- Wait a minute!

665
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,200
Disseminated flag.

666
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,200
These are English.

667
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:55,900
Send signals.

668
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,000
I never understood it
waving flags.

669
00:49:58,300 --> 00:50:00,200
General! What do they say?

670
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,300
Seeking permission ...

671
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,600
For landing on shore.

672
00:50:08,900 --> 00:50:10,900
That they blow, boss?

673
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,700
Tell them to disembark.

674
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:21,700
Attention!

675
00:50:26,100 --> 00:50:29,800
Gentlemen!
- Are you Mr. Lafitte?

676
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,200
Follow me, please.

677
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:46,000
Gentlemen, Mr. Lafitte!

678
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:06,500
Gentlemen. What can
do for you?

679
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:08,800
Mr. Lafitte, I
Captain Lockyer.

680
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:11,900
Frigates from her Majesty,
Queen Sophie.

681
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:16,700
Captain McWilliams! Lieutenant Rogers!
Captain Caldwell!

682
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:19,400
Captains?

683
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,000
This is a general Dominique You!

684
00:51:22,300 --> 00:51:23,900
Former commander of Napoleon!

685
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:26,300
And now assistant Jean Lafittea.

686
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,000
Commodore of our fleet,

687
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,100
sailing with the approval
Pirate letters Cartagena

688
00:51:30,300 --> 00:51:33,100
and His Excellency
Simon Bolivar!

689
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,400
So.

690
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,700
Two warships us
waiting in the harbor, Mr. Lafitte.

691
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,400
That we would not have caused concern,
we need to continue with our work.

692
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:47,300
We have an important letter for you.

693
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,600
About what?

694
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,000
English War Cabinet made
Strategic assessment of Barataria.

695
00:51:54,500 --> 00:51:56,800
Control back
entrance to New Orleans.

696
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,200
Your key positions us
can be of great benefit.

697
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:04,100
When planning
to attack New Orleans?

698
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,200
We'll be in New Orleans
in two weeks, sir.

699
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,900
Your help we can save
time and potentially life.

700
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:15,200
Gentlemen, I never talk
about the job before eating.

701
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,600
Eric ...

702
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,100
You will join me,
of course. - Thank you.

703
00:52:20,300 --> 00:52:23,800
Would you be so kind as to answer
to Sophia that we will be late?

704
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,200
To avoid interruptions.
- With pleasure.

705
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:27,700
Mr Pyke.

706
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:43,400
I have to admit, Mr. Lafitte, live
much better than would be expected.

707
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:45,600
It is ... I mean, you ...

708
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:51,500
You were expecting me zateai with wood
foot and bandage over one eye?

709
00:52:53,300 --> 00:52:55,600
Actually we did not know
what we expected.

710
00:52:56,300 --> 00:52:58,400
Do you have a portrait that attractive.

711
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,600
I guess copy Barrow?

712
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,700
No, sir, original. Only.

713
00:53:04,300 --> 00:53:07,700
The lady would be your
wife? - No, it would not be!

714
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,000
Captain ... no, no. You, sir.

715
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:18,000
Is this your medal
courage against the Americans?

716
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:20,800
No, sir, I had
luck against the French.

717
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,100
I see.
- S Nelson, the battle of the Nile.

718
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:29,500
Your'm not familiar with.
- What? This?

719
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,300
Vagrant, Marengo,
I forgot from where.

720
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:37,700
You know, at that time we
beating in many battles.

721
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,300
In this war would be on the side
winner, is not it, Mr. Lafitte?

722
00:53:41,700 --> 00:53:44,100
Oh yes, the side where I
I do, I will be victorious.

723
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:46,500
If we now join
against Americans,

724
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,500
spend the inland
backwater to New Orleans

725
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,000
each letter of the letters
will be achieved.

726
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,800
How generous
may be a crown?

727
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,700
We offer considerable estates
for you and your people.

728
00:53:57,900 --> 00:53:59,500
Country? For sailors?

729
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:01,200
Royal pardon for all.

730
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,100
Do not ask nobody's forgiveness.

731
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,900
I think I am turning
wrong man.

732
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,600
I thought that Mr.
Lafitte Barataria leader.

733
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:12,500
If the offer is good,
will resist criticism.

734
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,800
Offer is nice.

735
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,000
We are authorized by the Crown to pay
you 30 thousand in gold!

736
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,900
General, will you,
please pass the salt?

737
00:54:21,300 --> 00:54:23,700
Of course! Please.

738
00:54:24,500 --> 00:54:28,200
I think you are right
heard Captain McWilliams?

739
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:31,700
He said 30 thousand
dollars, Mr. Lafitte.

740
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:33,900
Oh yes, I heard it.

741
00:54:34,100 --> 00:54:36,100
Can you pick up your plate?

742
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:38,900
Pick him up, please.

743
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:41,700
From what has been made?

744
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:46,400
My God, pure gold!

745
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:50,100
He has 30 thousand dollars
Values ??in this table.

746
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:52,500
We offer one thing
You can not buy with money.

747
00:54:53,200 --> 00:54:55,400
EIN captain in
Royal Navy.

748
00:54:55,700 --> 00:54:57,800
I see you with anyone
you have a job?

749
00:54:58,100 --> 00:55:01,400
Ships Jean Lafitte
sail the world.

750
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:06,000
Hundreds captain hears
his commandments.

751
00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:08,700
I take it that
as your answer, Lafitte?

752
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:12,000
You receive my reply ...
for the week.

753
00:55:12,300 --> 00:55:14,600
When we get to New
Orleans, it will be too late.

754
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:17,500
And if I refuse?
- We have 50 warships.

755
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,400
16 thousand people, power
on land and sea,

756
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,500
Fresh after victory
over Napoleon.

757
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:26,300
England is a good friend,
but a bad enemy.

758
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:30,300
We do not need friends! I do not
we fear no enemy.

759
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:36,700
If you refuse, Lafitte, I have orders
raznesti Baratariju to bits. And I will.

760
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,500
I'll give you your answer
for the week.

761
00:55:42,600 --> 00:55:45,000
Gentlemen, you have 10 minutes
to catch the tide.

762
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:49,500
Eric, you make sure that the gentlemen
ispraaena be on their boats.

763
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,600
All right, sir.

764
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,500
One week.

765
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:21,200
How many people wanted to send
this little angel in heaven.

766
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,400
Hope
You treat well, boss.

767
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:25,700
Yet the New Orleans location
where the Corinthian ...

768
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:28,100
Come here!

769
00:56:30,500 --> 00:56:31,900
I will not say anything!

770
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:33,900
You just have to
trumpet fanfare?

771
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,000
Do not let him kill me, Mr.
Lafitte. - No you will not do nothing, Miggs.

772
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,700
We'll just take you to Maspero,
in New Orleans. - What is it?

773
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:45,400
There, we keep our
valuable cargo.

774
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:48,700
You'll leave me
there all alone?

775
00:56:49,000 --> 00:56:52,500
No. Pyke wife Tina
will take care of you.

776
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,500
I'd rather be with you, Mr.
Lafitte. -That's gratitude.

777
00:56:57,700 --> 00:57:00,600
Only a couple of people, which
I believe, as well as his wife.

778
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,200
His wife did not
at all like him.

779
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:07,500
If I'm going to be
I bring Mead?

780
00:57:07,700 --> 00:57:11,600
Who Mead?
- He is a very good guard.

781
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,700
It frightens me. Better it
bring with them.

782
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:24,000
Thank you, sir - then go with Pyke
on the dock. I'll come right away.

783
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,600
Come on, boy.
And watch out for the wolf.

784
00:57:28,500 --> 00:57:32,100
And Scipio, make sure
Head in the best clothes.

785
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:36,700
When you stand in front of the Governor Claiborne,
should shine like brilliant admiral.

786
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,000
10 years, Mr Pyke, I worry about
chief's clothes without your help!

787
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:42,700
What's wrong with you, Scipio? Is
it because too much reading?

788
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,600
Come on, kid.

789
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:46,800
Boss, I want to pack
and the English letters?

790
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,600
No, Scipio.

791
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,400
It will take me to check valid
Really your only American rules.

792
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,600
Mr. Head achieve
it all worth it.

793
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,500
<i> Yankee blockhead arrived in the city </ i>

794
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:04,000
<i> See the governor's daughter. </ i>

795
00:58:04,500 --> 00:58:10,400
<i> listened to his secret plans
and then pushed him into the water. </ i>

796
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,100
You have a great voice, General.

797
00:58:13,300 --> 00:58:15,100
Thank you.

798
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,600
Do you think that these letters will

799
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:22,600
to lift Corinthian
from the bottom of the sea?

800
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:27,000
I think it will open the door,

801
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:31,300
that you Claiborne
slammed in his face?

802
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:34,500
General, you drink?

803
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:38,100
You are right!

804
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:42,100
I felt the need
rink

805
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,900
for ten years,

806
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:50,600
of the night when you're me
while drinking different types of wine.

807
00:58:50,800 --> 00:58:52,900
Wine of freedom!

808
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:58,000
You showed me a world that
no boundaries, rules, flags.

809
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:00,600
General ...

810
00:59:00,800 --> 00:59:03,400
There comes a time when
the man wants to change.

811
00:59:07,100 --> 00:59:11,600
Belong to doing something,
or maybe someone.

812
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,800
Do you understand what will
you do it, Jean?

813
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:21,200
Motherland, women,
ideal? It's all false!

814
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,900
I never had a home.

815
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:26,100
Why do not I have ideals?

816
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:31,500
Ideals ... They are used to
clouded eyes fool you.

817
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:34,900
Like you! Well, me too!

818
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:38,600
I understand that and that is why I
escaped from France.

819
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:41,600
And I'll become an American
so I stopped running.

820
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:46,400
And you do not need these medals
to be felt as a general.

821
00:59:50,300 --> 00:59:52,600
Previously, I've never
disappointment, Jean.

822
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:55,600
If you can trust
a single man,

823
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:58,300
it's you.

824
01:00:02,700 --> 01:00:04,000
You will see, Dominique.

825
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:09,600
I'm going back home country greater than the
handbags country, you wear around your neck.

826
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:26,300
These are pretty important
documents, Mr. Lafitte.

827
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:30,200
It's about safety
your country, Governor.

828
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:34,800
By now you are worried about our laws.
Where'd concern for our safety?

829
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,600
I read some your
American rules.

830
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,000
If you are not the only
dead letter ...

831
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:46,900
might be worth fighting for them.
I have people, ships, weapons.

832
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,400
You need only ask.

833
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,300
We can not as Englishmen
offer 30 thousand dollars.

834
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:57,200
I did not come for the money.
- And what do you want?

835
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,600
Forgiveness for me and my people.

836
01:01:02,100 --> 01:01:03,900
Put us on
American flag.

837
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:07,200
You think you can walk in here,
throw some papers on the table and expect

838
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,300
you pardon for thousands of crimes?

839
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:14,600
For the week, the English
can you do an apostate.

840
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:17,300
Or let me
join you ...

841
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,000
or you may be you
asked to join me.

842
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:24,200
And with you on our side, think
that we can reject the English attack?

843
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:26,800
With the combination of Claiborne,
Jackson and Lafittea?

844
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:30,500
We can conquer the world.
- I'm not so ambitious, Lafitte.

845
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:32,800
I just want to save
United States.

846
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,100
That you lie on your palms.

847
01:01:37,100 --> 01:01:40,300
Almost feel the urge
accept your offer.

848
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,700
Okay, Lafitte.

849
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,800
I will convene an emergency tonight
Meeting of the Council of Defense.

850
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,900
I'm sure that on my recommendation
accept your proposal. - OK!

851
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:57,900
Dad, I'm ... I'm sorry!
- It's okay, honey.

852
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,300
I did not know you had company,
the door was open.

853
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:04,800
This is Mr. Jean Lafitte,
My daughter, Annette.

854
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,500
How are you?

855
01:02:12,100 --> 01:02:15,900
And both of them are alive.
- Yes. Mr. Lafitte and I

856
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:18,400
We became best friends.

857
01:02:18,700 --> 01:02:21,100
Excuse the expression.

858
01:02:21,500 --> 01:02:24,500
What should you, dear?

859
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:31,000
Your consent to the guest list
for the reception of General Jackson.

860
01:02:31,800 --> 01:02:34,700
We have good news for Jackson!

861
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,700
Still would not have
Baratariju attack.

862
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:41,000
Mr. Lafitte offered
fight on our side.

863
01:02:41,500 --> 01:02:43,000
I knew it!

864
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:48,200
I knew he would come help, Father.
- I'm glad you approve of it, Miss.

865
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,700
Now excuse me.
- Do you have transportation?

866
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:55,500
No, I told her coachman to me
waiting. I did not know you and I want you to go.

867
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,800
I understand. Annette, would you say Cato
carriage to put at the disposal of Mr. Lafitteu?

868
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,500
Sure. This way, Mr. Lafitte.

869
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:10,500
I constantly keep an eye on
My gun is constantly being pointed at him.

870
01:03:10,700 --> 01:03:14,300
If I knew you were there, I'd be afraid
over you, but our friends pirates.

871
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:18,400
Get that silly thing and told members
Defence Council for tonight's meeting.

872
01:03:18,700 --> 01:03:22,400
If I may be open, sir, is
it wise to trust a man ...

873
01:03:22,600 --> 01:03:27,600
Not naga?aj just told to
meeting. -Yes, sir!

874
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,500
I have prepared you a carriage.
- Thank you, Cato. I'll get out.

875
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:38,000
Jean, do not be like that!

876
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:43,000
So you want it to say. - It seems to me
that was the last time enough said.

877
01:03:43,300 --> 01:03:45,500
It was just
my stupid pride.

878
01:03:46,300 --> 01:03:49,600
Now, when I
what have you done ...

879
01:03:49,800 --> 01:03:52,400
I did it just
for his people and himself.

880
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:56,600
If you're going to feel better if
hurt me, go ahead. Jean ...

881
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:01,300
Loving you,

882
01:04:01,500 --> 01:04:04,500
most important thing in my life.

883
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,500
Please believe it.
- Annette.

884
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:10,600
Annette!
- Yes. Father.

885
01:04:10,900 --> 01:04:13,400
What will people think?
- About what?

886
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,000
You left out Mercier
the guest list.

887
01:04:16,300 --> 01:04:19,700
Dad, I know that Mr.
Mercier is always upsets.

888
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:23,800
I know, honey, but the people in our
position must hide feelings.

889
01:04:24,100 --> 01:04:27,800
I will endeavor, Father. - Maybe we should
invite our friends, pirates.

890
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,300
You should meet with General
Jackson as soon as possible.

891
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,700
I announce our engagement.
- I'd be thrilled.

892
01:04:33,900 --> 01:04:36,100
What did you say?

893
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:40,700
Do not be a coward, tell him. - She
I'd be thrilled, Father.

894
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:45,100
Do we have to yell at each
other? Why are you standing there?

895
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:50,200
Oh, stung my hand on a thorn.

896
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,800
If we reach
agreement with Lafitteom,

897
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:01,800
maybe we should be hanged
pirate flag in the city.

898
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:05,100
We're not here for discussion
Reputation Jean Lafittea!

899
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:08,400
He offered his assistance and
waiting for our answer.

900
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,400
Respond cannon.

901
01:05:10,600 --> 01:05:14,600
Before I surrendered to the English,
but given the land into the hands of the rabble.

902
01:05:14,900 --> 01:05:17,600
At least maintain their dignity.
- General Jackson will need

903
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:20,600
men and ammunition. Lafitte
We offer both.

904
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:24,300
On the battlefield, General
do not ask who delivered bullets.

905
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,200
I completely agree
with the Governor!

906
01:05:26,500 --> 01:05:28,700
At Jackson's place would
rather have a deal with the Devil.

907
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:33,200
In any case, here we have
decide on the authenticity of these letters.

908
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:37,400
That is not the question. - You believe that
fake? - Not enough are authentic.

909
01:05:37,500 --> 01:05:41,300
Only proven to work with the English.
- Renegade is, I do not believe that he was a traitor.

910
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:44,700
You think Lafitte waived 30
thousand and position in the British Army,

911
01:05:44,700 --> 01:05:47,200
Just because, in order to
become a U.S. citizen?

912
01:05:47,500 --> 01:05:51,400
You would not, Mr. Mercier?
- Gentlemen, I agree with all the put,

913
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:54,500
but we can not ignore the opinion
our esteemed governor.

914
01:05:54,500 --> 01:05:58,600
We are wasting time. Give me an order
to throw Lafittea of ??Barataria!

915
01:05:58,800 --> 01:06:00,700
You have my vote!
- Mine!

916
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:04,900
Solve at least one enemy.
- Gentlemen, gentlemen! Consider this.

917
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,700
Lafitte is one of the best
hope, that this country has.

918
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:10,800
Gentlemen, we can not
agree. Vote.

919
01:06:11,100 --> 01:06:14,700
You know what, chief? Already the
I feel appreciated.

920
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:19,100
What do you think, Pyke, what
chances for people to be with us.

921
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:22,200
Just tell me how
you want to vote.

922
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:25,100
We're not so, Pyke.

923
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:28,500
From now on, everything must
be democratic.

924
01:06:31,100 --> 01:06:35,700
Maybe a little friendly
persuasion, but democratic.

925
01:06:38,200 --> 01:06:40,000
Boss!

926
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:50,400
Englishmen.
- They waited.

927
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,500
Pyke, can you see someone
to find. - OK!

928
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:13,100
Calalou! Calalou!

929
01:07:21,300 --> 01:07:22,700
Calalou!

930
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:39,000
You're back where
you started, Lafitte?

931
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,100
There is no one to listen to your
orders, except mosquitoes.

932
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,200
How are you British
missed? - English?

933
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:49,900
Your American friends
We were visited.

934
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:52,400
You lie like a dog!

935
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,200
See ...

936
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:58,000
Recognize U.S.
uniform when I see it.

937
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:06,100
We fired at them, but
We Dominique prevented.

938
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:10,200
All called them out
docekaju, klicu them.

939
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:14,300
Sing "Yankee Doodle."

940
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:17,700
Then we resort
exploded in his face.

941
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:21,800
Does someone pulled?
- Some fled to the swamps.

942
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:26,100
Some were put in chains,
to be hanged.

943
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:30,200
Dominique was right!

944
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:36,300
No one can believe that.

945
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:41,500
Oh, how I've waited for this moment, when
I'll see you broken, defeated.

946
01:09:45,100 --> 01:09:47,900
Now when I see it, it hurts. -Don't
give me your pity.

947
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:51,500
More I liked your
hatred. - Where are you going?

948
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,900
New Orleans!

949
01:09:57,400 --> 01:10:01,300
I'll wring your people from jail
if I have to kill the Jackson.

950
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:03,800
No! Do not go
in New Orleans!

951
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:07,700
Because if the Americans do not
kill your own people will.

952
01:10:07,900 --> 01:10:10,300
We ourselves go to Cartagena,
perhaps to Galvez in the Gulf.

953
01:10:10,900 --> 01:10:13,400
Why do you care
What will happen to me?

954
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:16,900
Because you're a part of it all, I
ever loved. I hated it.

955
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,300
Very nicely sung,
Ms. Claiborne. Thank you.

956
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:51,000
Thanks to you, my dear.

957
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:55,900
This is my favorite song Rachel.
You gave me a feeling of home.

958
01:11:56,300 --> 01:11:58,700
It's the least we could do
make for a brave soldier,

959
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:00,800
who came to defend our city.

960
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:05,100
Not to mention the beautiful ladies,
that adorn it. - Thank you.

961
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,300
I want to assure you, sir, that
hearts and homes of the city

962
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,700
open to you
and your people.

963
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:12,900
I am very grateful, ma'am.

964
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:16,500
I can assure you that we will
Defend your city from danger.

965
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:20,300
You're charming, General.
But they said they are from the countryside.

966
01:12:20,700 --> 01:12:25,100
But farmer from Tenesseeja,
ma'am. That is the key.

967
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:29,400
General Jackson, were
We honored if you

968
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:32,300
you and your officers tomorrow
had dinner with us.

969
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:35,600
I accept with pleasure,
lady, on one condition.

970
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,200
The condition?

971
01:12:37,500 --> 01:12:39,900
That tomorrow evening
I'm still alive.

972
01:12:40,100 --> 01:12:42,700
You will not be living or tomorrow morning,
if you do not drink your milk.

973
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:45,100
Not now, Mr. Peavey!
- I put in your medicine.

974
01:12:45,300 --> 01:12:48,400
Mr. Peavey. - Do not mind
to it, Miss. Claiborne,

975
01:12:48,700 --> 01:12:50,800
shame me since
before your birth.

976
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:52,400
Come on! Drink a cure!

977
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:54,600
Commodore Patterson comes.

978
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:01,100
General Jackson,
Commodore Patterson.

979
01:13:01,300 --> 01:13:02,900
Commodore.
- General.

980
01:13:03,100 --> 01:13:05,500
I am pleased to inform you
the mission is accomplished.

981
01:13:05,800 --> 01:13:08,600
Barataria is
completely destroyed.

982
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,800
What?

983
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:14,900
Father, how could they?
You promised Mr. Lafitteu!

984
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:18,200
What about Lafitteom?
- It is not among the prisoners.

985
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:22,500
Father, you gave him the word.
- Excuse me, Miss Claiborne.

986
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,900
Governor. General.

987
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:30,100
There is serious news.

988
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:33,000
English army arrived
to Lake Bourne.

989
01:13:33,300 --> 01:13:34,900
English! On the lake?

990
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:37,200
It is less than 50 km.

991
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,300
General, what can we do?

992
01:13:40,200 --> 01:13:42,200
Keep a cool head.

993
01:13:42,500 --> 01:13:44,400
Mr. Peavey, Colonel,
Major Reed.

994
01:13:45,700 --> 01:13:50,000
General, is expected to defend New Orleans
with this ... poor more trained people?

995
01:13:50,200 --> 01:13:52,900
My troops are trained
to fight, not for show.

996
01:13:53,100 --> 01:13:55,800
But they lack guns,
gunpowder and ammunition.

997
01:13:56,000 --> 01:14:00,500
But no heart for a fight. - We have
think of our homes, families.

998
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:03,200
It seems that you have to think
at all, except at home.

999
01:14:03,500 --> 01:14:06,000
Brave words, but you can not
they shoot down the enemy.

1000
01:14:06,200 --> 01:14:08,500
We'll stay alive
only if we surrender.

1001
01:14:12,000 --> 01:14:14,800
I'll be very clear, gentlemen!

1002
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:20,000
Before I give this
city, I will burn it to the ground.

1003
01:14:20,400 --> 01:14:23,500
General Jackson, we have the right
decide on their own fate.

1004
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:26,500
You'll discover that we have
strong civilian government.

1005
01:14:26,700 --> 01:14:29,900
And you'll discover that you have
receive orders from me.

1006
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:34,300
If I have to declare
state of emergency.

1007
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,900
We are in the hands of a madman!

1008
01:14:37,100 --> 01:14:39,200
Philip, do not!

1009
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:49,600
Completely clear to me, sir,
you're either a coward or a traitor.

1010
01:14:49,800 --> 01:14:52,000
Racunajte the militia, sir.

1011
01:14:52,200 --> 01:14:54,200
The entire New Orleans
with you, General.

1012
01:14:54,500 --> 01:14:57,100
The city is yours. Zapovijedajte.
- My son will follow you, General.

1013
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:00,300
Perhaps the general
at least explained his plans.

1014
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:04,600
Senator, that the hair on my head
know my plans, I'd cut it.

1015
01:15:05,600 --> 01:15:10,300
Colonel, konfiscirajte all carriage and
wagons in the city. - Yes, sir.

1016
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,700
Major! Let all the troops
preparation for movement. - Yes, sir.

1017
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:20,500
When Andy like bad-tempered, I would be
out of the way, if I were you.

1018
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,300
What is it, Andy?

1019
01:15:28,600 --> 01:15:30,700
Something bothers you?

1020
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:43,200
I've never seen you so many dead
people say you're going to defend them.

1021
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,900
Defend the United
States, Mr. Peavy.

1022
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:50,300
Better beware force for later.

1023
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:54,200
Andy, please,
Drink your milk.

1024
01:15:54,700 --> 01:15:57,300
Give me a break, drink it.

1025
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:02,100
If you drink, ispeai
I'll get you a nice turkey.

1026
01:16:02,300 --> 01:16:04,300
Not now, Mr. Peavy,

1027
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:07,400
just keep those barkers
away from me.

1028
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:11,200
Waiting for me a lot of important
job. - All right, Andy.

1029
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,100
It is a stubborn man
I've seen in my life.

1030
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:18,600
How long do I have to try,
only that he drank a cure.

1031
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,900
Do not move!

1032
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:38,500
I do not call a guard.

1033
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:43,800
I'll call guard
when I'm ready.

1034
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:49,100
Who are you?
- Jean Lafitte.

1035
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:52,600
So ...

1036
01:16:54,300 --> 01:16:55,600
What do you want?

1037
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:58,100
Sign the authorization to
my people released from prison.

1038
01:16:58,300 --> 01:17:00,400
You know, I just do not like
when we are threatened.

1039
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:04,300
Do not even shoot, Mr. Peavy.

1040
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:06,700
It is an old trick, Jackson.

1041
01:17:07,700 --> 01:17:13,000
Mr. Peavy, greet
Mr. Lafittea, pirates.

1042
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,800
How are you, Mr. Lafitte,
I'm glad to meet you.

1043
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:19,400
To pull the trigger now, Andy?

1044
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:24,300
Do you have anything to say before
answer this question?

1045
01:17:24,500 --> 01:17:26,200
Yes.

1046
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:29,400
I want to publish my testament.

1047
01:17:30,700 --> 01:17:34,400
The stolen gold
you buried?

1048
01:17:34,700 --> 01:17:39,600
No. A warehouse full of gunpowder
and eight thousand flint.

1049
01:17:42,400 --> 01:17:45,500
Flint for muskets?
- In exchange for my people.

1050
01:17:46,900 --> 01:17:50,400
Where are these flint?
- Where is the gunpowder.

1051
01:17:54,300 --> 01:17:56,700
Put the guns on
table, Mr. Lafitte.

1052
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:03,900
How much powder?

1053
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:07,000
I do not like to talk with weapons
pointed at his back.

1054
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:10,400
Leave us alone, Mr. Peavy.

1055
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:13,700
You want to tie
before I go, Andy?

1056
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:16,100
No, no, thank you.

1057
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:20,400
(I'm out, if I
need anything. Just call.)

1058
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,400
Come on, get out!

1059
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:27,500
So what's with the Flint?

1060
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:29,400
What about my people?

1061
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,100
Flint and gunpowder in the city?

1062
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:35,600
You'll find out when my
last man get out of jail.

1063
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:39,900
Englishmen on my neck and I do not
time to talk all night.

1064
01:18:40,100 --> 01:18:44,500
I need gunpowder and flint, but you will not
get approval, until I find out where they are.

1065
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,500
Playing live, Jackson.

1066
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:51,800
And if we put a bullet in
head, however, I will kill you catch up.

1067
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,300
Let me go! I have to go in there.

1068
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:59,200
What's with that guy? - I do not know,
Andy, blebeae some nonsense.

1069
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:03,400
Talk in English!

1070
01:19:05,200 --> 01:19:06,900
I do not understand.

1071
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,500
Do not stand just so, can you
anyone tell me what this says?

1072
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,500
Do not look at me, Andy.

1073
01:19:12,700 --> 01:19:16,300
Trying to tell you that the English
army at his father's plantation.

1074
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:21,800
Where is it? - Where's the plantation?
- Oh, thank God, speak French.

1075
01:19:26,300 --> 01:19:29,200
12 kilometers to the south,
the sleeve Catalan.

1076
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:34,400
Mr. Peavy, make sure
for the guy.

1077
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:41,200
You know the terrain, can
show me on the map? - There is.

1078
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,100
Now we go down the road
for Showmut.

01:19:49,900 --> 01:19:52,600
What's this here?

1082
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:53,900
Channel Rodrigues.

1083
01:19:54,200 --> 01:19:57,300
Butler, that we set up positions,
with the river on the right side,

1084

It took us three allies. -Yes, sir.

1085
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:06,800
Reed, many soldiers can equip?
- One hundred, sir. - One hundred ... All right.

1086
01:20:07,100 --> 01:20:11,200
Son, you're gonna buy us time.
Englishmen have to go through this constriction.

1087
01:20:11,400 --> 01:20:15,500
Keep them, blow bridges, fell trees,
what you will remember, they just slow down.

1088
01:20:15,700 --> 01:20:19,400
Yes, Mr. Jackson. - Son!
- Yes, sir? - Take it easy.

1089
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,300
Yes, sir.

1090
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:24,200
When we can deliver
one flint and gunpowder?

1091
01:20:24,500 --> 01:20:26,500
As soon as my people
get out of jail.

1092
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:32,600
Just do not like paying the bill
Before we supplying goods.

1093
01:20:34,600 --> 01:20:36,500
It will be delivered to you
on the battlefield.

1094
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:40,200
You know that this means a full pardon for all
your your devils who will fight!

1095
01:20:40,500 --> 01:20:44,300
How many do you recruit? - Can
you promise only one. Themselves.

1096
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:47,500
Now would be pirates fight
on our side, Andy?

1097
01:20:47,900 --> 01:20:53,100
Mr. Peavey, I'm not in a position to be
nice. Puk. Butler? - Yes, sir.

1098
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:54,900
Here we go. -Yes, sir.

01:20:55,100 --> 01:20:57,000

Andy, would you

1101
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:05,900
We could, Mr. Peavey.
For her we'll fight.

1102
01:21:16,900 --> 01:21:21,100
Watchman. - Hey,
What are these bells?

1103
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:23,700
Celebrate our hanging?!

1104
01:21:29,500 --> 01:21:34,900
Shut up! Stop it, you scum!

Which one of you is
general Dominique You?

1106
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:41,400
I have the honor.

1107
01:21:41,900 --> 01:21:45,300
They sing "Yankee Doodle"
General. Maybe you go.

1108
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:47,500
The first will dance on the rope.

1109
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:50,700
Vraaajte inside!

1110
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,100
Give my regards to Captain Brown!

1111
01:21:55,500 --> 01:21:59,500
Do not be afraid, Dominique, the last enemy
confronting death.

1112
01:22:10,900 --> 01:22:14,500
Thank you, gentlemen.

1113
01:22:15,300 --> 01:22:18,000
You'll be najtrulije apples,

1114
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:21,100
that ever fell
the tree for hanging.

1115
01:22:22,600 --> 01:22:27,100
But I learned to love
each of you worms,

1116
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:32,500
because of the goodness of our brotherhood
better than all the lies countries.

1117
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,400
Only one thing
Life can trust ...

1118
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:38,200
That will end by death!

1119
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,600
So! When it arrives ...

1120
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,300
spit in her eye!

1121
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,600
Hello, General,

1122
01:22:53,100 --> 01:22:55,800
I was afraid that you will not be more
see this side of Hell.

1123
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:58,700
Are you so eager
send me there,

1124
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:01,300

tight rope?

1125
01:23:01,900 --> 01:23:05,500
If you are really into it
believe, Dominique, here.

1126
01:23:07,700 --> 01:23:10,800
Why did you come here?
- Of all the people in the world,

1127
01:23:11,000 --> 01:23:14,300
you've never
want to let you down.

1128
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,500
Everyone with whom I have believed me
betrayed. Why would you be differently?

1129
01:23:20,800 --> 01:23:24,800
I promised your country ...
Read this.

1130
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,200
Signed Jackson!

1131
01:23:27,900 --> 01:23:31,800
Why do you think you can trust him?
- He believed me today.

1132
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:34,800
One of his word and
I blew the head.

1133
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:37,900
Instead, we gave
freedom for all of you.

1134
01:23:38,600 --> 01:23:40,700
In exchange for weapons and supplies,

1135
01:23:40,900 --> 01:23:42,600
forgiveness for every man,

1136
01:23:42,900 --> 01:23:45,200
to join him
on the battlefield.

1137
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:48,400
People will not listen.
- I do not have time to convince them.

1138
01:23:49,600 --> 01:23:51,900
This is freedom
for you and them.

1139
01:23:52,100 --> 01:23:54,000
Freedom - to continue to run,

1140
01:23:54,300 --> 01:23:57,000
or belong to the land, which
have the courage to fight.

1141
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:01,800
Well, Dominique, held
my promise.

1142
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:16,100
Okay, deploy it.

1143
01:24:16,300 --> 01:24:20,400
Careful!
- Put them on the battlefield.

1144
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:29,400
This is my car and load. You can not
so. I will complain to your superiors.

1145
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:32,000
Inverted.
Appeal to the English.

1146
01:24:32,900 --> 01:24:36,100
Kentucky, if you make them too high,
you will not be able to see the English.

1147
01:24:36,200 --> 01:24:39,700
I'll make them a high that no
they see me, General.

1148
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:43,100
General, this is my cotton
packed and ready for shipment.

1149
01:24:43,300 --> 01:24:47,300
Then you'll help defend him.
Mr. Peavey, give him a musket.

1150
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:49,300
Yes, General.

1151
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,700
Here you go. I do not shoot himself.

1152
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,900
Well, stop the
line, sir.

1153
01:25:01,800 --> 01:25:07,600
Sarge, set good shooters
in the canopy of those trees. - Yes. General.

1154
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:16,700
Reed?
- Yes, sir.

1155
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:21,400
In 3.bateriji need filling powder.
Take care of it. - Yes, sir.

1156
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:25,200
Guys, you have an extra cup of coffee?
- Help yourself.

1157
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:26,600
Good morning, General.

1158
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:33,600
Well, son, that now
feel? - All right, sir.

1159
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:38,300
I bet that was the morning radio
Kentucky, but here with me, huh?

1160
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:43,300
No way, sir! At home I in
This time Gaca in the mud with pigs.

1161
01:25:46,500 --> 01:25:49,300
Andy, you better drink some
coffee, well you will do.

1162
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:52,400
Not now, Mr. Peavey.
- Okay, I'll drink it.

1163
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:57,400
This is so bad, that would
horse shoe floating.

1164
01:25:58,800 --> 01:26:00,900
Come on, soldiers, hurry up!
We do not have all day.

1165
01:26:01,700 --> 01:26:05,700
Nobody has excess silica, Major.
What's this? - I'm just so found.

1166
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,300
How old is expected to face a hawk
win the war, no flints for muskets?

1167
01:26:10,500 --> 01:26:13,700
Why not let the Old Hawk
face some worries about private?

1168
01:26:13,800 --> 01:26:15,900
Excuse me, sir.
- It's okay.

1169
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,500
They called me once
and worse names.

1170
01:26:19,100 --> 01:26:22,100
Actually, General,
we are close to the bottom of the barrels.

1171
01:26:22,300 --> 01:26:25,400
It will be enough for flint
Male, when Lafitte appears.

1172
01:26:26,300 --> 01:26:27,700
Indeed we expect that will come?

1173
01:26:28,100 --> 01:26:32,100
Well, Major, otherwise
make my hair may become gray.

1174
01:26:33,700 --> 01:26:37,000
If you ask me, you cursed pirates
returned to New Orleans and robbery in the city.

1175
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:43,700
Battalion, whoa!

1176
01:27:11,400 --> 01:27:14,500
General, do you think that these will
poles stop red coat?

1177
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:17,300
Will slow them enough
to beat them.

1178
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,700
Win, no silica
For the male?

1179
01:27:23,100 --> 01:27:25,200
What's this? - For the
serving your country.

1180
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,900
I thought my life
worth more than $ 1.

1181
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,500
Documents, please. Thank you.

1182
01:27:29,700 --> 01:27:31,500
Your musket.

1183
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:38,900
From this fog we get sick more
but from that lunch on Tuesday.

1184
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:41,700
I hope it will remain so. Not
I can shoot what they see.

1185
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,100
Andy, you better put your scarf.
- Good to meet you, Mr. Peavey.

1186
01:27:45,700 --> 01:27:51,100
I see that you're cold, put a scarf.
Andy Jackson, come back!

1187
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:56,300
Document, please. You are not
write the next of kin.

1188
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:57,800
I have none, sir.

1189
01:27:58,000 --> 01:28:02,000
Who we notify in case of ...
- Well ... - Family Claiborne. Thank you.

1190
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:04,300
Your musket.

1191
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:11,800
Your musket.

1192
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:16,700
What I'm going with this? - When the Fire and keep
without gunpowder, using the butt as a bat.

1193
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:19,600
You receive later gunpowder.

1194
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:22,000
If you arrive.

1195
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:24,400
Governor, how are citizens
recruited for me?

1196
01:28:24,700 --> 01:28:29,900
So far more than 300, General.
- More than I expected.

1197
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:31,500
This is very urgent.

1198
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:38,300
We have more manpower than
ammunition. Out of gunpowder.

1199
01:28:38,900 --> 01:28:40,800
Yes, I know ...

1200
01:28:41,300 --> 01:28:42,900
Coming soon yet.

1201
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:47,700
I hope they keep the promise Lafitte
better, but we are his to him.

1202
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:50,500
What is it?
- Enemy!

1203
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:55,000
Excuse me, sir, that
Only our patrol returns.

1204
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:57,500
Why did they shoot? - I guess they
someone nervous fingers.

1205
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,000
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1206
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:02,900
Pull back.

1207
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:05,000
You do not recognize U.S.
trumpet when you hear?

1208
01:29:05,200 --> 01:29:06,700
It is our patrols.

1209
01:29:10,300 --> 01:29:14,100
Cease fire! Cease fire!

1210
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,700
Cease fire!

1211
01:29:22,400 --> 01:29:24,200
English, General.
I think they're in the woods.

1212
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:27,900
Tell me what happened.
son. - Thousands of them.

1213
01:29:28,000 --> 01:29:30,500
Where? Near-forest
cypress trees, next to the river.

1214
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:33,600
Ready to attack?
- Gather, sir,

1215
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:37,600
550 meters away. Although they were not
can stop, General. Nothing!

1216
01:29:38,500 --> 01:29:42,000
Got hot coffee down there,
I might wash the smell of gunpowder.

1217
01:29:42,100 --> 01:29:44,000
Thank you, General!
- Major Reed!

1218
01:29:44,500 --> 01:29:46,100
Send me couriers.

1219
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:49,200
Colonel Butler, looks
that will soon begin.

1220
01:29:53,000 --> 01:29:55,300
You came here because of fighting
and by God, I'll fight it.

1221
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:59,000
You think you're signed up for
Sunday Mass, soldier?

1222
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:02,500
Sergeant! - Yes, sir! - Return of
civilians to their battle stations.

1223
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:06,800
These civilians will only annoy us
When the battle began, General.

1224
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:09,700
That is why we must all
keep them together, soldier.

1225
01:30:10,200 --> 01:30:13,200
You, on that gun.

1226
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:18,000
Do you know bunglers
how to put a charge?

1227
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:22,700
What are you, Andy, to break the ice?
- This is directed will only affect rabbits.

1228
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,100
Let me, please.
- Get out, Mr. Peavey!

1229
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:27,900
Do not waste this power, Andy.

1230
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:41,900
Get back to where you or I,
I swear to God, I have to kill you.

1231
01:30:51,100 --> 01:30:53,700
Add water to it,
Mr. Peavey. - Yes, sir.

1232
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:56,200
It's okay. These are just a rocket.

1233
01:30:56,300 --> 01:30:58,300
More bark than bite you!

1234
01:31:01,400 --> 01:31:03,100
Ready to fire?
- Ready, sir!

1235
01:31:03,200 --> 01:31:04,600
Fire!

1236
01:31:14,000 --> 01:31:16,500
Fog is too thick
to see anything.

1237
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:20,200
Can we somehow stop
These missiles, General?

1238
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:23,500
We do not have enough gunpowder, to
spend it on missiles, Governor.

1239
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:27,900
Only create confusion before
than go on the attack.

1240
01:31:28,100 --> 01:31:30,100
They tried the same
and in Bladensburg.

1241
01:31:37,900 --> 01:31:40,400
General, arrived
Lafitte and his men.

1242
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:41,900
Thank God. Where are they?

1243
01:31:42,200 --> 01:31:44,100
Come from the swamp.

1244
01:32:08,100 --> 01:32:09,900
A little late, Mr. Lafitte.

1245
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:12,100
We used
travel overland.

1246
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:14,400
Although late,
you're welcome.

1247
01:32:16,900 --> 01:32:18,700
We have prepared a warm docek.

1248
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:22,900
It will be warmer and, if flint
and gunpowder do not share the battlefield.

1249
01:32:23,100 --> 01:32:25,900
Colonel Butler? - Yes, sir? - This
it takes people in the 3rd battery.

1250
01:32:26,000 --> 01:32:27,700
Yes, sir. Immediately.

1251
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:31,000
Hold it right!
- I intend to!

1252
01:32:32,000 --> 01:32:35,600
Captain, this share
stock. - Yes, sir!

1253
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:42,400
Hey, I heard that
came Jean Lafitte.

1254
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:44,800
I've never seen a pirate.

1255
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:46,900
Go and give him a kiss,
brought gunpowder.

1256
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:54,200
What we have here, Andy?
- Power from Heaven, sir, Peavey.

1257
01:32:55,300 --> 01:32:58,300
Just let the good fight,
as they fought against us.

1258
01:32:59,000 --> 01:33:02,200
Go get some of my denim,
some help here.

1259
01:33:07,100 --> 01:33:08,400
How long have you brought gunpowder?

1260
01:33:08,500 --> 01:33:10,400
Enough that you can
shoot the whole month.

1261
01:33:10,700 --> 01:33:12,400
Now we have to fight thereby.

1262
01:33:12,700 --> 01:33:14,700
Here! Give me a flint!

1263
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:21,000
Flint as you need.
- Flint of the pirates?

1264
01:33:21,200 --> 01:33:23,100
Englishmen will not know the difference.

1265
01:33:24,200 --> 01:33:25,800
Whence comes such a powder?

1266
01:33:26,000 --> 01:33:27,800
We purchased specially for you.

1267
01:33:29,300 --> 01:33:31,700
You thought that you will lose
war, before we arrived.

1268
01:33:32,000 --> 01:33:34,400
Yeah? Now that you have brought
gunpowder, you can go home.

1269
01:33:36,600 --> 01:33:39,200
Beluche, get on it
tree. Yes, General.

1270
01:33:41,500 --> 01:33:43,900
Pablo, you go to it.
- Yes, General.

1271
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:46,500
Give me the guidelines.
- Yes, General.

1272
01:33:47,700 --> 01:33:50,500
In it you will shoot, Lafitte?
There was no command to fire.

1273
01:33:51,300 --> 01:33:53,600
These flares create too
noise, silence we them.

1274
01:33:54,300 --> 01:33:57,100
It is a waste of
gunpowder, Mr. Lafitte!

1275
01:33:57,400 --> 01:34:00,600
I would not say, General. See
where they come out of the fog.

1276
01:34:00,800 --> 01:34:04,100
That could be seen in the
Shoot, my people would have already been shot!

1277
01:34:04,200 --> 01:34:07,000
We topdiju who does not have
see the target to hit.

1278
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,800
What do you say, that distance?
- I would say ... 550 meters.

1279
01:34:11,700 --> 01:34:14,200
Okay, just give.
Your gunpowder.

1280
01:34:15,900 --> 01:34:18,300
There is a charge!

1281
01:34:33,400 --> 01:34:36,900
Odlican hit!
Blow have them!

1282
01:34:42,900 --> 01:34:46,400
Excellent job, General!
- Not a bad top, you know.

1283
01:34:47,500 --> 01:34:49,000
Back to posts!

1284
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:54,300
Hey, boss.
- What is it?

1285
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:57,800
Who is so good with a cannon?
- One man, sir.

1286
01:34:59,100 --> 01:35:02,900
Mr. Lafitte, my compliments.
- Need to congratulate the general.

1287
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:05,500
General?
- General Dominique You.

1288
01:35:05,700 --> 01:35:07,500
Fought with Napoleon.
- Come on ... silent.

1289
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:11,900
It's an honor to have you with us, sir.
- It is an honor, General.

1290
01:35:16,300 --> 01:35:18,500
Very handsome man.
- Well, Dominique,

1291
01:35:18,700 --> 01:35:20,500
we still have a lot of war.

1292
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:23,100
Beluche! Fill the top!
- Yes, sir!

1293
01:35:23,200 --> 01:35:24,900
Horseface, purify it!

1294
01:35:28,600 --> 01:35:31,400
Battalion, prepare bayonets!

1295
01:35:34,200 --> 01:35:39,400
Prepare bayonets!

1296
01:35:42,500 --> 01:35:44,800
Prepare bayonets!

1297
01:36:22,100 --> 01:36:24,500
This is the loudest silence
I've ever heard, boss.

1298
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:27,700
Enjoy it while it lasts.

1299
01:36:28,500 --> 01:36:32,300
I wonder how many hours?
- What do you care, do not go anywhere.

1300
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:36,300
Weapons preparation!

1301
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,000
Weapons preparation!

1302
01:36:39,800 --> 01:36:41,700
Weapons preparation!

1303
01:36:45,000 --> 01:36:47,400
Battalion in the plane of the attack!

1304
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:49,800
Forward, march!

1305
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,600
Like someone slaughtered a pig.

1306
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:37,500
It is music, play bagpipes.

1307
01:37:37,900 --> 01:37:39,900
Will you fight or dance?

1308
01:37:43,800 --> 01:37:48,100
This causes a tingling at Kiem.
- Yes, sir, it is intended.

1309
01:37:49,000 --> 01:37:51,200
Okay, all the places!
- All the places!

1310
01:37:59,000 --> 01:38:00,800
Just relax, guys.

1311
01:38:05,700 --> 01:38:09,700
Mr. Lafitte, make sure your
People do not shoot until they are well

1312
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:13,200
see the target. Muskets are
of effective over long distances.

1313
01:38:13,500 --> 01:38:15,600
Add me spyglass,
Mr. Peavey.

1314
01:38:16,400 --> 01:38:18,800
If not for this damn fog
My long-Kentucky

1315
01:38:19,000 --> 01:38:22,400
them blew 100 meters
before the shoot.

1316
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:26,100
What is the range of your
Guns? - Range?

1317
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:30,100
These beauties all hit squirrel
the eye to almost 300 meters.

1318
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:33,900
Then you just need to know
when they come into range.

1319
01:38:34,200 --> 01:38:39,300
I would not say that we will send the English
signal. -The English would not, but I do I want!

1320
01:38:39,700 --> 01:38:41,900
Tired of life, Mr. Lafitte?

1321
01:38:42,000 --> 01:38:44,200
I'll go with you, boss.
- No, you're too big a target.

1322
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:45,400
Mouse?
- Yes, boss.

1323
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:47,100
Got powder with you?
- Yes, boss.

1324
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:49,900
General, can you give me
one of your Indians?

1325
01:38:55,200 --> 01:38:57,400
Is it good with a bow?
- Good enough.

1326
01:38:59,300 --> 01:39:00,900
Come on, Pyke.

1327
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,300
No, Toro, you wait here.

1328
01:39:22,300 --> 01:39:24,400
It looks like the battle will
soon to start, huh?

1329
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:35,300
This is about 300 meters.

1330
01:39:45,700 --> 01:39:47,300
Mouse, gunpowder.

1331
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:26,300
Here it is!
- Lafitteov signal.

1332
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:42,100
Shall we shoot, sir? - No.
I want to give them a chance to return.

1333
01:40:42,200 --> 01:40:44,300
But the enemy is in range, sir!
- As Lafitte, Colonel.

1334
01:40:44,600 --> 01:40:46,300
I'm going to count 40 seconds
before firing.

1335
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:50,600
Every second, are getting closer.
- I'm going to count 40 seconds, Major!

1336
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,600
Fire!

1337
01:41:33,200 --> 01:41:36,200
Battalion, whoa!
Fire!

1338
01:43:00,800 --> 01:43:03,400
That must be
quite a surprise, Governor.

1339
01:43:03,700 --> 01:43:05,600
Annette and Captain Lafitte.

1340
01:43:06,000 --> 01:43:09,300
Yes, the father does not always know
a first for kaerkine plans.

1341
01:43:12,600 --> 01:43:14,900
Why do you care uci
dance, Lizzie?

1342
01:43:15,100 --> 01:43:17,500
I learn them.

1343
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:20,100
Why did not you go back for more
a piece of pie, it's very good?

1344
01:43:20,700 --> 01:43:25,200
I'd rather stay observe how
you and Lizzie lovingly watching.

1345
01:43:25,700 --> 01:43:30,000
Listen! How many times have I told you
not to call me Lizzie, Miss Pest!

1346
01:43:32,200 --> 01:43:34,800
Come on, I'm going and reloading the
the dance floor.

1347
01:43:35,300 --> 01:43:38,200
Lizzie has precious!
Lizzie has precious!

1348
01:44:00,600 --> 01:44:02,200
Why are you hiding in there?

1349
01:44:03,300 --> 01:44:06,100
I do not hide it.
Looking for friends.

1350
01:44:07,400 --> 01:44:09,500
I bet you do not
do you know anyone here.

1351
01:44:10,600 --> 01:44:12,900
Ah, I know! My
A friend of Mr. Lafitte.

1352
01:44:13,000 --> 01:44:16,800
Where did you meet him?
- It's a big secret.

1353
01:44:17,500 --> 01:44:20,200
I've never watched so.
- You're not the Jean Lafitte.

1354
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:24,100
What are you afraid?
- I'm afraid I see anything!

1355
01:44:25,500 --> 01:44:27,100
See?

1356
01:44:28,200 --> 01:44:31,600
I bet the Whistle
does not work. - I do!

1357
01:44:35,600 --> 01:44:37,200
See?

1358
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:44,600
Let me fuanem.
- No!

1359
01:44:46,900 --> 01:44:49,800
You know what, if you go to call
my friend Mr. Lafittea,

1360
01:44:50,100 --> 01:44:51,900
I'll give you that trying some.

1361
01:44:52,700 --> 01:44:54,400
What I'm going to tell him?

1362
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:58,100
Just tell him that Miggs here
and that it wants to immediately see.

1363
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:07,900
So ... good. Beware this for me
and do not eat any.

1364
01:45:14,200 --> 01:45:15,600
Marjorie! Marjorie!

1365
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:17,600
Stop it. Where did you get it?

1366
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:19,500
From my friend, Miggs.

1367
01:45:19,700 --> 01:45:23,100
It seems that someone won.
Inherited his mother's charm.

1368
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:25,600
I can not say that someone named
Miggs sounds appropriate for zeta.

1369
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:28,700
Miggs?

1370
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:32,700
Miggs ...

1371
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:36,300
Hello, my son, what is the news about my
friend, Captain Thomas with Corinthian.

1372
01:45:36,600 --> 01:45:40,600
I do not know, sir.
- Wait a minute.

1373
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,800
How did you get so
quickly returned?

1374
01:46:03,400 --> 01:46:06,700
Everyone thank you very much
in this tribute.

1375
01:46:13,400 --> 01:46:17,200
There is another man who
he deserved to get these same honors.

1376
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:21,400
He brought me three things,
necessary, in Chalmette:

1377
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,000
Flints for muskets,

1378
01:46:23,300 --> 01:46:25,300
Gunpowder and brave people.

1379
01:46:26,300 --> 01:46:28,800
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Mr. Lafitte.

1380
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:38,300
Once again, my
personal gratification.

1381
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:42,800
You know, for a man who has spent most of
life was spent in an unstable deck,

1382
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:44,500
rather slow dance.

1383
01:46:44,700 --> 01:46:48,200
The trust generals, dancing
I always causes seasickness.

1384
01:46:50,500 --> 01:46:54,700
Ms. Claiborne, nice
you like a princess.

1385
01:46:56,400 --> 01:46:59,400
Thank you, General.
- That's my Rachel here

1386
01:46:59,500 --> 01:47:01,900
We showed you
Rural dance steps.

1387
01:47:03,500 --> 01:47:07,700
I wish I was there for you,
General. - I am too.

1388
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:27,500
General Dominique,

1389
01:47:28,300 --> 01:47:31,500
I see that you have an eye for beauty,
as well as for artillery.

1390
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:35,500
General Jackson, I want you
present this lovely lady,

1391
01:47:35,700 --> 01:47:37,300
Miss Bonnie Brown.

1392
01:47:37,700 --> 01:47:39,900
I'm glad, Miss Brown.

1393
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,200
Perhaps you will
interest, Miss,

1394
01:47:44,300 --> 01:47:48,300
I was recommended by General
for its exceptional contribution to the struggle.

1395
01:47:49,500 --> 01:47:53,300
Thank you, sir. Excuse me,
Bonnie. General?

1396
01:47:55,100 --> 01:47:57,900
I have to admit something,

1397
01:47:58,100 --> 01:48:00,700
I do not want to lie
General like you.

1398
01:48:01,100 --> 01:48:03,900
See ... I was just ...

1399
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:10,500
Actually, I was
only distributor.

1400
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:15,400
Well, I've seen the fight
General, my friend.

1401
01:48:16,400 --> 01:48:18,600
I am very grateful.

1402
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:21,500
Thank you.
- Miss Brown.

1403
01:48:28,500 --> 01:48:30,300
Something is wrong with your hand?

1404
01:48:30,500 --> 01:48:34,900
Yes, Miss. She needs
your beautiful hand. Come on, Bonnie.

1405
01:48:39,000 --> 01:48:42,700
This is like a fairy tale.
- Yes, is not it? Is not that right, Jean?

1406
01:48:44,200 --> 01:48:46,900
Yes, it is ... how much we still have to
stay? - Not for long.

1407
01:48:47,000 --> 01:48:49,000
You're lucky, Annette.

1408
01:48:49,400 --> 01:48:51,600
This is so romantic.

1409
01:48:51,800 --> 01:48:54,000
You have to bring the bridegroom
at my house for dinner.

1410
01:48:54,100 --> 01:48:56,300
With pleasure.
- Lucky you man, Lafitte.

1411
01:48:56,500 --> 01:48:58,500
On the contrary, sir,
I'm the lucky one.

1412
01:48:59,200 --> 01:49:01,900
Well, see you soon,
very soon!

1413
01:49:02,100 --> 01:49:04,900
Do not you think we already
exposed long enough?

1414
01:49:05,100 --> 01:49:06,900
Maybe I am,
but you're not.

1415
01:49:07,800 --> 01:49:10,500
I want every woman in the world
be jealous of me.

1416
01:49:11,100 --> 01:49:13,900
Annette, we can
see the ring? - Of course!

1417
01:49:18,100 --> 01:49:20,100
I can not do it!
- Bonnie!

1418
01:49:20,500 --> 01:49:23,800
All you have to say is
'Congratulations'. I smile.

1419
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:29,600
That's enough, let's go.

1420
01:49:31,500 --> 01:49:33,800
I'd rather him smash
bottle on his head.

1421
01:49:37,800 --> 01:49:41,000
My general!
- Jean, Miss Claiborne.

1422
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:43,800
Miss Brown barely
waiting to congratulate you.

1423
01:49:44,900 --> 01:49:48,600
That's it. Good luck to both of them.

1424
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:50,900
Thank you, very kind of you.

1425
01:49:51,300 --> 01:49:54,700
It is a fish that is hard
catch, Miss Claiborne.

1426
01:49:55,600 --> 01:49:57,700
Yes, it was not easy.

1427
01:50:00,100 --> 01:50:03,400
What are you looking at? Something
wrong with my clothes?

1428
01:50:03,700 --> 01:50:07,700
Not at all, you look good.
- You're gorgeous, the dress is beautiful.

1429
01:50:08,000 --> 01:50:11,600
Did you know that the same kind of madame
de Dupre made for me?

1430
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:14,500
But she's my sister
took the Corinthian.

1431
01:50:17,800 --> 01:50:19,700
Corinthian?

1432
01:50:19,900 --> 01:50:22,500
Would not that be embarrassing,
both wear the same clothes?

1433
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:26,500
Proof that tailors
never be trusted.

1434
01:50:27,500 --> 01:50:30,900
I hear a waltz. Miss,

1435
01:50:31,400 --> 01:50:33,900
I insist that I
tribute dance.

1436
01:50:34,200 --> 01:50:36,200
Excuse me.
- Of course.

1437
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:49,300
Jean.

1438
01:50:50,800 --> 01:50:52,900
I did not want.

1439
01:51:04,600 --> 01:51:06,600
Jean, I'll go from here.

1440
01:51:07,100 --> 01:51:09,400
I will solve the dresses,
I'll burn it.

1441
01:51:10,300 --> 01:51:12,300
No one has ever
will not see it, I swear.

1442
01:51:12,400 --> 01:51:16,200
Will it revive her sister?
- Annette does not have to know.

1443
01:51:16,700 --> 01:51:21,100
You could say that the Corinthian sank in
storm, was lost at sea, who would know?

1444
01:51:21,300 --> 01:51:23,100
I'll know.

1445
01:51:26,600 --> 01:51:28,300
What are you going to do?

1446
01:51:30,900 --> 01:51:33,800
Tell her.
- You're a fool.

1447
01:51:33,900 --> 01:51:36,800
You'll lose everything you've
loved and for which you have fought.

1448
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:40,200
You gave up everything
you had, all that you are.

1449
01:51:40,500 --> 01:51:43,500
Jean, I do not even want
see how far you lose.

1450
01:51:44,500 --> 01:51:46,700
Would you be able to love a man,
who killed your sister?

1451
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:50,600
I could love a man
who killed my father!

1452
01:51:53,300 --> 01:51:57,000
Mr. Lafitte, there was a boy who
you want to see. It's called Miggs.

1453
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,000
Where is it? -There,
with your dog.

1454
01:52:04,900 --> 01:52:07,900
Tell him that I was waiting behind the house,

1455
01:52:08,800 --> 01:52:10,800
right now, you know?

1456
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:13,800
Is it really your friend?
- Yes, of course. Go now.

1457
01:52:17,500 --> 01:52:19,800
Go back, wait for me
there with Miggs.

1458
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,800
Jean, I'm afraid.
- Go!

1459
01:52:28,700 --> 01:52:29,800
Have Miggs.

1460
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,000
Maybe we have to fight for
output, boss. To call people?

1461
01:52:32,200 --> 01:52:34,200
No, I would not be fighting.
Listen up, everyone.

1462
01:52:34,400 --> 01:52:36,300
Go to Raven. Prepare
him to sail.

1463
01:52:36,600 --> 01:52:40,300
I will come if I can.
- You're not going to come to terms with this without me.

1464
01:52:41,200 --> 01:52:42,800
Dominique, this is an order!

1465
01:52:43,000 --> 01:52:45,000
If you do not I come to
two hours sail.

1466
01:52:45,200 --> 01:52:47,200
You heard the boss. Come on.

1467
01:52:48,800 --> 01:52:51,700
Something is very odd.
Boy refuses to answer.

1468
01:52:51,900 --> 01:52:54,300
How do we expect to match,
when all vicete on it?

1469
01:52:54,600 --> 01:52:58,700
Annette was right. Listen,
son, no you will not do nothing.

1470
01:52:59,000 --> 01:53:03,000
We just want to know how you left
Corinthian? How did you get back?

1471
01:53:03,300 --> 01:53:05,400
Corinthian yet
could agree.

1472
01:53:06,100 --> 01:53:09,000
I do not know ... was night.

1473
01:53:09,800 --> 01:53:12,600
Spread your wings and
flown? - Stupid!

1474
01:53:13,700 --> 01:53:18,900
You did not fall overboard?
- That's right, sir! I fell over.

1475
01:53:19,200 --> 01:53:21,600
How did this happen? Tell us.

1476
01:53:22,100 --> 01:53:25,000
There was a storm,

1477
01:53:26,100 --> 01:53:27,700
big waves.

1478
01:53:27,800 --> 01:53:30,000
There was no storm, my son.
- Yes, it was!

1479
01:53:30,200 --> 01:53:31,900
And there have been big waves ...

1480
01:53:32,000 --> 01:53:35,800
Is the ship sinking?
- What? No ...

1481
01:53:37,000 --> 01:53:38,300
I do not know.

1482
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:40,700
I know what you'll get
to tell the truth.

1483
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:43,100
For God's sake, Mercier,
do not raise your hand to a child.

1484
01:53:43,400 --> 01:53:46,900
I put a quarter of a million dollars
that ship and I'll find out what happened.

1485
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:48,800
Wait, Mercier, ship
is certainly sunk.

1486
01:53:49,700 --> 01:53:51,500
Were they British?

1487
01:53:52,400 --> 01:53:54,000
No, sir.

1488
01:53:54,100 --> 01:53:57,000
Was he Lafitte? - Mr.
Mercier, how dare you?

1489
01:53:57,200 --> 01:54:00,000
Mercier, do not stand at my
porch and the amount of such charges!

1490
01:54:00,200 --> 01:54:04,500
If you were British, then who is?
- Mr. Lafitte was not even there! He was ...

1491
01:54:05,500 --> 01:54:08,100
Lafitte was it?
- Mr. Lafitte was ...

1492
01:54:08,300 --> 01:54:09,900
He's what?

1493
01:54:10,000 --> 01:54:12,600
I can not answer that
question! I was there.

1494
01:54:12,900 --> 01:54:14,600
What?

1495
01:54:15,500 --> 01:54:17,500
Corinthian is submerged.

1496
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:26,700
Were there any survivors?

1497
01:54:27,300 --> 01:54:29,600
All but one were killed.

1498
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,300
Have you participated
in fact, Lafitte?

1499
01:54:35,600 --> 01:54:37,700
I was their boss.

1500
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,800
Mr. Lafitte!

1501
01:54:42,400 --> 01:54:44,900
Mr. Lafitte, I just
come say hi to you,

1502
01:54:45,000 --> 01:54:47,000
I did not want this to happen.

1503
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:48,800
Mr. Lafitte!

1504
01:54:49,000 --> 01:54:51,800
Jean!
- Hang the murderer!

1505
01:54:52,700 --> 01:54:55,700
Jean, tell them it was not you!
- You would not believe it.

1506
01:54:56,200 --> 01:55:00,600
Mr. Lafitte, I did not want! - No
need for arbitrating! Hang him now!

1507
01:55:01,900 --> 01:55:03,300
Bring the rope!

1508
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:08,500
Father, stop them!

1509
01:55:08,800 --> 01:55:10,900
You want to defend this killer?

1510
01:55:11,100 --> 01:55:13,400
Father, he did not do it,
I can guarantee life.

1511
01:55:14,600 --> 01:55:16,600
And what is the life
your sister?

1512
01:55:16,800 --> 01:55:18,400
Father.

1513
01:55:21,300 --> 01:55:23,000
G. Peaky.

1514
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:26,400
G. Peaky. Call General
Jackson, tell him what you intend.

1515
01:55:26,800 --> 01:55:28,800
Do not worry, honey, I'm going
for him. - Hurry!

1516
01:55:33,500 --> 01:55:35,800
Switch rope over!

1517
01:55:39,400 --> 01:55:43,000
Not here! Hang him
on the street, where it belongs.

1518
01:55:43,200 --> 01:55:45,900
Wait! Nobody criticizes
this man, as I do.

1519
01:55:46,500 --> 01:55:49,100
I lost my daughter. But you can not
take the law into their own hands.

1520
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:52,600
Lafitte himself outlawed! - Yes!
I'll be happy to see him hanged,

1521
01:55:52,700 --> 01:55:56,600
but not from the wild crowd. - Turn soft
to associate with him. Give it here!

1522
01:55:58,700 --> 01:56:02,400
You're insane! Behave
like animals!

1523
01:56:09,700 --> 01:56:13,700
By God, I'll kill
the first to be moved!

1524
01:56:16,300 --> 01:56:19,000
This city is still under
state of emergency.

1525
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:21,300
How does this apply
the killer?

1526
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,300
Responsible for the death of 80 people ...

1527
01:56:25,400 --> 01:56:27,000
Silence!

1528
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:31,000
Lafitte, are you
sunk the ship?

1529
01:56:33,000 --> 01:56:34,900
I was responsible.

1530
01:56:35,600 --> 01:56:38,100
I risked myself
Wealth on Corinthian.

1531
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:41,100
What have you risked to
front, Mr. Mercier?

1532
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:45,800
Jean has offered to assist in the defense of our
country, and you have destroyed Baratariju!

1533
01:56:46,100 --> 01:56:49,400
And yet we came to help.
- It's not about that, Miss Claiborne!

1534
01:56:49,500 --> 01:56:51,400
That being said, sir!

1535
01:56:52,400 --> 01:56:54,400
I gave a promise to this man.

1536
01:56:54,500 --> 01:56:58,900
A full pardon for all his
man, who join me on the battlefield.

1537
01:56:59,800 --> 01:57:01,800
He gave his word.

1538
01:57:04,000 --> 01:57:07,000
I'll keep mine.

1539
01:57:08,100 --> 01:57:10,500
I will keep you in word, General.

1540
01:57:10,600 --> 01:57:12,600
I'll meet up with one
Clock advantages.

1541
01:57:14,200 --> 01:57:16,100
Release him.

1542
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:20,700
Okay, Lafitte,
Your clock is started.

1543
01:57:30,100 --> 01:57:31,800
Jean!

1544
01:57:32,900 --> 01:57:36,400
I'll go with you. - Annette,
what kind of life we ??have?

1545
01:57:38,200 --> 01:57:40,300
Without a country, without a home,
without belonging icemu.

1546
01:57:41,300 --> 01:57:45,700
We belong to each other.
You are the whole world that I want.

1547
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:50,000
Annette, you do not know what
meant to spend his life on the run.

1548
01:57:51,200 --> 01:57:54,100
I want to live and die with you.

1549
01:57:55,000 --> 01:57:56,800
Jean!

1550
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,800
Too much love, that
I'd brought with me.

1551
01:58:11,000 --> 01:58:14,100
What you can bring
the memory of you.

1552
01:58:22,400 --> 01:58:25,300
I can not give you back your daughter, you
lost to Corinthian, Governor.

1553
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:32,900
I can give you back what
I love most in the world.

1554
01:58:47,500 --> 01:58:49,200
Lafitte!

1555
01:58:49,400 --> 01:58:51,900
No corner of the world,
where you'll be safe.

1556
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:56,500
At least leave
all of you safe.

1557
01:58:57,200 --> 01:58:59,400
In the American New Orleans.

1558
01:59:17,300 --> 01:59:19,800
Keeps the wind in your sails!

1559
01:59:20,800 --> 01:59:23,700
You'll hang the flag?
- We do not have flags.

1560
01:59:24,800 --> 01:59:26,200
What course?

1561
01:59:27,800 --> 01:59:29,400
The open sea.

1562
01:59:34,300 --> 01:59:37,000
Keep the wind in the stern.

1563
01:59:45,600 --> 01:59:48,200
Where are we going, Dominique?
- Where it belongs.

1564
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:52,900
When a man loses everything
Others, still has the sea.

1565
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,300
This deck is the only
homeland we have.

1566
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,600
It's all homeland
I want.
