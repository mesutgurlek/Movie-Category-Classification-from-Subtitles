1
00:01:45,086 --> 00:01:46,781
The winter of 1938

2
00:01:46,854 --> 00:01:51,314
was one year before the beginning
of the Second World War,

3
00:01:51,392 --> 00:01:56,762
and Paris was still an island of light
in the darkness of Europe.

4
00:01:56,831 --> 00:02:01,165
And everywhere, men saw
the new European citizen...

5
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:03,760
the refugee.

6
00:02:03,838 --> 00:02:05,135
And on the streets,

7
00:02:05,206 --> 00:02:10,166
political refugees rubbed shoulders
with the refugees from life.

8
00:02:10,244 --> 00:02:14,943
And no one cared
if these men and women lived or died.

9
00:02:15,016 --> 00:02:18,213
So history prepared the end of an era

10
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:21,278
and the beginning of our times.

11
00:02:42,577 --> 00:02:43,771
Your friend's escaped.

12
00:02:43,845 --> 00:02:45,107
Halt!

13
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:46,441
Sybil Fildorf.

14
00:02:46,514 --> 00:02:47,674
She had nothing to do with it.

15
00:02:47,748 --> 00:02:48,874
Sybil Fildorf.

16
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,247
Was never in my confidence.

17
00:02:50,318 --> 00:02:52,786
- Sybil Fildorf.
- I scarcely know her.

18
00:02:52,854 --> 00:02:54,344
Sybil Fildorf!

19
00:02:54,422 --> 00:02:56,083
- What happened on the road?
- I don't know.

20
00:02:56,157 --> 00:02:58,751
You don't know, you don't know.
Tell me what you know.

21
00:02:58,826 --> 00:03:00,885
She knows nothing.
There is nothing to know.

22
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:02,623
She will know.

23
00:03:02,697 --> 00:03:05,063
Crack.

24
00:03:05,132 --> 00:03:06,463
- You know.
- I don't know.

25
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:09,166
Yes.

26
00:03:09,237 --> 00:03:12,400
<i>Oziri zigarette.
They're gold-tipped.</i>

27
00:03:15,743 --> 00:03:18,610
You have given us unnecessary trouble.

28
00:03:29,223 --> 00:03:31,589
<i>Ja, she's dead.</i>

29
00:03:31,659 --> 00:03:33,456
You're quite right.
She did not know.

30
00:03:33,528 --> 00:03:36,190
Is a pity.

31
00:03:36,264 --> 00:03:37,253
My apologies.

32
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,340
Your bill, sir.

33
00:03:54,415 --> 00:03:55,746
Certainly.

34
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:23,972
This raid,

35
00:04:24,045 --> 00:04:26,411
the police pick up this fellow Polyanski

36
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,879
in some bistro.

37
00:04:27,949 --> 00:04:29,746
He told them where he lived.

38
00:04:29,817 --> 00:04:31,114
Did they catch anyone else?

39
00:04:31,185 --> 00:04:32,447
No, no, no, no.

40
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,115
Madam Favier was able to get them
all down to the cellar.

41
00:04:38,926 --> 00:04:40,951
Ah, good evening, Colonel.
Dr. Ravic.

42
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:42,427
Good evening.

43
00:04:42,496 --> 00:04:44,259
Good evening.

44
00:04:44,332 --> 00:04:46,163
Let us play game of billiards, eh?

45
00:04:46,233 --> 00:04:49,066
Police will probably be
busy upstairs for some time.

46
00:04:49,136 --> 00:04:50,364
All right.

47
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:51,996
- Name?
- Mueller.

48
00:04:52,073 --> 00:04:53,665
You keep out of this.

49
00:04:53,741 --> 00:04:55,003
Name?

50
00:04:55,076 --> 00:04:56,839
Polyanski.

51
00:04:56,911 --> 00:04:58,503
Vladislav Polyanski?

52
00:04:58,579 --> 00:05:00,843
Didn't you know this man had no papers?

53
00:05:00,915 --> 00:05:02,780
I wasn't on the desk when he registered.

54
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:05,216
Alois, if you ever let another person
register without papers...

55
00:05:05,286 --> 00:05:06,947
Never mind that.

56
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:08,852
This isn't your first offense.

57
00:05:08,923 --> 00:05:10,220
I'm sorry, but this time,

58
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:12,521
you'll get six months
before we deport you.

59
00:05:12,593 --> 00:05:13,924
Next time, it'll be worse.

60
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:15,155
It's the law.

61
00:05:15,229 --> 00:05:18,528
I saw Haake.

62
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:19,861
Again?

63
00:05:19,934 --> 00:05:21,196
Uh, are you sure?

64
00:05:21,268 --> 00:05:23,168
Yes.

65
00:05:23,237 --> 00:05:24,499
Did he see you?

66
00:05:24,572 --> 00:05:25,596
No.

67
00:05:25,673 --> 00:05:27,402
Do you think he would recognize you

68
00:05:27,475 --> 00:05:29,033
if he did see you?

69
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,099
He thinks I'm dead.

70
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:32,873
Lucky for your friends at home.

71
00:05:32,947 --> 00:05:35,939
He recognized Krauss.

72
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:38,417
Krauss has no friends left.

73
00:05:38,486 --> 00:05:39,976
Ghosts.

74
00:05:40,054 --> 00:05:42,318
I thought I would be over this by now.

75
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,551
Eh. One never is.

76
00:05:44,625 --> 00:05:48,186
I am still waiting
for three Franco Spaniards.

77
00:05:48,262 --> 00:05:49,957
That's my dream.

78
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:54,624
Everybody in this room has his dream.

79
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:58,872
Rappaport, over there,

80
00:05:58,939 --> 00:06:02,705
he dreams they are pulling out
his fingernails again.

81
00:06:02,777 --> 00:06:05,371
Krings dreams they are chasing him down

82
00:06:05,446 --> 00:06:06,708
<i>Unter der Linden.</i>

83
00:06:06,781 --> 00:06:09,944
He runs and runs,
but they always catch him.

84
00:06:10,017 --> 00:06:13,009
Schultz,

85
00:06:13,087 --> 00:06:15,988
his friends call him The Bird of Death.

86
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:19,721
He dreams of the next disaster.

87
00:06:19,794 --> 00:06:23,423
He left Berlin two weeks
before Hitler came to power.

88
00:06:23,497 --> 00:06:27,160
He left Vienna three days
before the Nazis came in.

89
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:32,771
My dream is Sybil's face

90
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,899
after they had finished with her.

91
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:37,409
She couldn't tell them anything
because she knew nothing.

92
00:06:37,478 --> 00:06:38,843
She was not in my confidence.

93
00:06:38,913 --> 00:06:41,939
She meant no more to me
than a beautiful painting.

94
00:06:42,016 --> 00:06:44,450
They expected her to crack,
but she didn't crack.

95
00:06:44,518 --> 00:06:47,248
She let them kill her, right before my eyes.

96
00:06:47,321 --> 00:06:48,583
Haake killed her.

97
00:06:48,656 --> 00:06:51,124
She had a world of courage,
but no great strength.

98
00:06:51,192 --> 00:06:53,786
She lasted a very little while.

99
00:06:53,861 --> 00:06:55,795
You will have your revenge, Ravic.

100
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:57,626
These crimes cannot go unpunished.

101
00:06:59,066 --> 00:07:01,899
Revenge? No, not revenge.

102
00:07:01,969 --> 00:07:04,961
Revenge is a personal thing.
This is something bigger.

103
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,635
Sybil's face is now the symbol
of thousands of beaten faces.

104
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,644
Haake must never leave France.

105
00:07:11,712 --> 00:07:15,546
Each time he returns to Berlin,
innocent people die.

106
00:07:15,616 --> 00:07:17,777
By the hundreds, they die.

107
00:07:48,082 --> 00:07:49,811
Let me go.

108
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:56,316
Let me go.

109
00:07:57,725 --> 00:07:58,987
Go where?

110
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:01,391
Leave me alone.

111
00:08:01,462 --> 00:08:03,487
You're not well.

112
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:06,397
Let me get you a cab
and send you home.

113
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:13,231
What?

114
00:08:13,307 --> 00:08:14,672
Did you hear me?

115
00:08:14,742 --> 00:08:18,303
I said I'll put you in a cab and send you
to your apartment, your hotel.

116
00:08:18,379 --> 00:08:19,641
Hotel?

117
00:08:19,713 --> 00:08:20,771
Or wherever you live.

118
00:08:20,848 --> 00:08:22,315
No, not my hotel.

119
00:08:22,383 --> 00:08:23,850
Then where?

120
00:08:25,452 --> 00:08:29,684
Look, if you're thinking
of taking a swim, don't.

121
00:08:29,757 --> 00:08:32,726
It's the wrong time of year.
The water is too cold.

122
00:08:34,862 --> 00:08:36,159
I hadn't thought of it.

123
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:40,564
Oh, well, then, I won't be responsible
for putting ideas in your head.

124
00:08:40,634 --> 00:08:41,896
Come.

125
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:43,903
I know a little place around the corner.

126
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:46,701
You need a drink to warm you up.

127
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,902
Come on.

128
00:08:48,976 --> 00:08:51,706
The bridge will always be here.

129
00:08:53,147 --> 00:08:54,739
What do you want to drink?

130
00:08:54,815 --> 00:08:56,077
Anything.

131
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:58,516
Two Calvados and a package
of Chesterfields.

132
00:08:58,586 --> 00:08:59,814
Only French.

133
00:08:59,887 --> 00:09:02,082
Then give me a package
of Laurents... Green.

134
00:09:02,156 --> 00:09:03,248
Only Blue.

135
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:11,896
All right, Blue.

136
00:09:11,966 --> 00:09:14,799
I may still have one Green left.

137
00:09:22,676 --> 00:09:24,735
Green. Found one after all.

138
00:09:24,812 --> 00:09:26,109
Were you in the Navy?

139
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,374
No, the circus.

140
00:09:27,448 --> 00:09:29,439
Oh, better still.

141
00:09:29,516 --> 00:09:31,541
Here, drink this.

142
00:09:31,619 --> 00:09:33,211
Drink it all at once.

143
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:35,380
For a moment, it will give you the illusion

144
00:09:35,456 --> 00:09:38,118
that you are living in a hot, dry country.

145
00:09:40,527 --> 00:09:42,154
Which way are you going?

146
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:45,361
I don't know.

147
00:09:45,432 --> 00:09:46,660
Where do you live?

148
00:09:46,734 --> 00:09:48,395
I can't go there, not there.

149
00:09:48,469 --> 00:09:51,302
Don't you know anyone
to whom you can go?

150
00:09:51,372 --> 00:09:53,169
You could call them up from here.

151
00:09:55,109 --> 00:09:56,371
No.

152
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:57,637
No, there is nobody.

153
00:09:57,711 --> 00:09:59,440
But you must go somewhere.

154
00:09:59,513 --> 00:10:01,276
Haven't you any money for a room?

155
00:10:01,348 --> 00:10:03,782
Yes, yes, I have.

156
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:05,318
Then go to a hotel.

157
00:10:05,386 --> 00:10:06,683
Look, you've got to go somewhere.

158
00:10:06,754 --> 00:10:08,779
You can't stay
in the streets in this rain.

159
00:10:12,526 --> 00:10:13,788
Yes, you're right.

160
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:15,123
You're quite right.

161
00:10:15,195 --> 00:10:17,459
Don't trouble about me anymore.

162
00:10:17,531 --> 00:10:20,659
I'll find a place.

163
00:10:20,734 --> 00:10:22,224
Thank you for everything.

164
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,579
All right.

165
00:10:41,655 --> 00:10:43,088
Come with me.

166
00:10:43,157 --> 00:10:45,284
We'll find something for you.

167
00:10:45,359 --> 00:10:46,587
Thank you.

168
00:11:05,946 --> 00:11:08,574
This room was empty yesterday.

169
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:12,915
Madame Favier must have locked it
for fear the bedbugs will get away.

170
00:11:16,623 --> 00:11:18,056
Sit down a moment.

171
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,559
I'll try from the balcony side.

172
00:11:35,309 --> 00:11:36,571
It's no use.

173
00:11:36,643 --> 00:11:38,543
The window is locked, too.

174
00:11:42,649 --> 00:11:44,913
May I sit here for a moment?

175
00:11:44,985 --> 00:11:46,418
You can sleep here.

176
00:11:46,487 --> 00:11:49,354
That's the easiest thing.

177
00:11:49,423 --> 00:11:51,755
You should have
left me on the street.

178
00:11:51,825 --> 00:11:53,588
You won't disturb me.

179
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,720
It's not the first time
someone has stayed here all night

180
00:11:56,797 --> 00:11:59,391
because he had nowhere else to go.

181
00:11:59,466 --> 00:12:01,593
This is a hotel for refugees,

182
00:12:01,668 --> 00:12:04,603
people with prices on their heads,

183
00:12:04,671 --> 00:12:07,697
people who hang themselves
the next morning

184
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:09,766
or leave for Peru.

185
00:12:09,843 --> 00:12:11,105
You can take the bed.

186
00:12:11,178 --> 00:12:13,271
I'll sleep on the sofa. I'm used to it.

187
00:12:13,347 --> 00:12:15,212
No, no, I'Il...

188
00:12:15,282 --> 00:12:17,512
I'll just stay where I am.

189
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:23,089
If I may only sit here, that's all.

190
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:25,955
Just as you like.

191
00:12:26,026 --> 00:12:27,618
Better take off your coat.

192
00:12:27,694 --> 00:12:28,752
It's quite wet.

193
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:30,524
Your hat, too.

194
00:12:41,542 --> 00:12:43,203
Now your shoes.

195
00:12:48,549 --> 00:12:50,141
Take off your stockings.

196
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:53,152
I'll get you a pair of woolen ones.

197
00:12:55,389 --> 00:12:58,222
In critical times,
have an eye for comfort.

198
00:12:58,292 --> 00:13:00,317
That's an old soldier's maxim.

199
00:13:02,863 --> 00:13:04,125
Hello?

200
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:05,324
Oh, oh, yes, Veber.

201
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:08,664
I'll be there at once.

202
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,566
I've got to go out.

203
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:14,905
It's all right. You can stay here.

204
00:13:15,976 --> 00:13:17,273
Can't I go with you?

205
00:13:17,344 --> 00:13:18,470
No, no, impossible.

206
00:13:18,545 --> 00:13:20,536
You stay here and take whatever you need.

207
00:13:20,614 --> 00:13:21,808
Oh, here.

208
00:13:21,882 --> 00:13:25,181
You'll find pajamas
in the bottom drawer.

209
00:13:25,252 --> 00:13:27,345
Thank you.

210
00:13:27,421 --> 00:13:29,218
Please, may I keep the light on?

211
00:13:32,292 --> 00:13:35,022
I wasn't going to turn it off.

212
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:36,892
I know that feeling.

213
00:13:57,518 --> 00:13:59,213
Lucien.

214
00:13:59,286 --> 00:14:00,981
Where is my Lucien?

215
00:14:21,141 --> 00:14:22,233
How is she?

216
00:14:22,309 --> 00:14:25,005
Pulse, 100.

217
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:27,945
Pressure, 110 over 80.

218
00:14:45,599 --> 00:14:48,898
Pulse is weak and thready, 140.

219
00:14:48,969 --> 00:14:51,267
Pressure, 70 over 40.

220
00:14:55,909 --> 00:14:57,900
I can't get her pressure.

221
00:15:00,547 --> 00:15:02,242
Is she gone?

222
00:15:02,316 --> 00:15:03,715
Yes.

223
00:15:05,052 --> 00:15:07,577
You did all you could, Ravic.

224
00:15:07,654 --> 00:15:09,451
We can't win against quacks.

225
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:14,692
Love,

226
00:15:14,761 --> 00:15:17,423
your magic spell is everywhere.

227
00:15:17,497 --> 00:15:21,934
The bracelet on her ankle read,
"Always, Lucien."

228
00:15:22,002 --> 00:15:24,596
Where is Lucien now?

229
00:15:26,139 --> 00:15:28,437
21 years old, Veber.

230
00:15:28,508 --> 00:15:31,238
21 years old.

231
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:33,939
The dignity of man,
the beauty of woman,

232
00:15:34,014 --> 00:15:37,211
the innocence and subtlety of love,

233
00:15:37,284 --> 00:15:40,151
a quack in a dirty cellar,

234
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,482
then this.

235
00:15:41,555 --> 00:15:42,988
By now you should be tough.

236
00:15:43,056 --> 00:15:44,250
One is never tough,

237
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:46,656
but one can get used to a lot of things.

238
00:15:46,727 --> 00:15:47,887
That's what I mean.

239
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:50,930
But with some things, never.

240
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:56,425
Good night, Colonel.

241
00:16:14,254 --> 00:16:15,312
Drive on.

242
00:16:16,390 --> 00:16:18,324
Hello, hello!

243
00:16:18,392 --> 00:16:19,791
Hello, Boris.

244
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:23,352
Eh, busy again
with scientific murder, eh?

245
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:28,493
Is idiotic, a doctor of your ability
not allowed to work everywhere,

246
00:16:28,568 --> 00:16:30,433
but must hide out as ghost surgeon.

247
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:31,664
I'm not alone.

248
00:16:31,738 --> 00:16:33,103
The Nazis saw to that.

249
00:16:33,173 --> 00:16:35,505
Colonel.

250
00:16:35,575 --> 00:16:37,167
A racing car.

251
00:16:42,249 --> 00:16:43,841
You don't laugh?

252
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:46,249
But, Colonel, it was a good joke.

253
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,582
Or wasn't it?

254
00:16:47,654 --> 00:16:49,315
Very good.

255
00:16:49,389 --> 00:16:52,483
But racing car was, perhaps, even better.

256
00:16:52,559 --> 00:16:54,220
Come on.

257
00:16:58,699 --> 00:17:00,530
Mind your manners, Boris.

258
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,830
You know, he might
complain to your boss.

259
00:17:02,903 --> 00:17:05,201
Oh, Captain Alidze?

260
00:17:05,272 --> 00:17:07,365
He was lieutenant in the Tsar's Guard.

261
00:17:07,441 --> 00:17:08,999
I was lieutenant-colonel.

262
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:10,634
He still remembers that, my boy.

263
00:17:10,711 --> 00:17:12,235
You had better remember it, too,

264
00:17:12,312 --> 00:17:15,975
you pickpocket of death without passport.

265
00:17:16,049 --> 00:17:17,710
When are you going to be through?

266
00:17:17,784 --> 00:17:19,752
Right after we have drink on the house.

267
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:21,287
Come along.

268
00:17:32,999 --> 00:17:34,899
It's all right.

269
00:17:34,968 --> 00:17:35,935
It's me,

270
00:17:36,002 --> 00:17:37,629
the man who brought you here.

271
00:17:41,475 --> 00:17:44,569
I think we can turn the light off now.

272
00:17:44,644 --> 00:17:46,669
I thought you would be gone.

273
00:17:46,747 --> 00:17:48,715
I'll go.

274
00:17:48,782 --> 00:17:49,908
Never mind.

275
00:17:49,983 --> 00:17:51,177
Wait.

276
00:17:51,251 --> 00:17:52,741
We'll have some breakfast.

277
00:17:57,657 --> 00:18:00,649
Here, drink your coffee.

278
00:18:04,831 --> 00:18:06,264
You got a headache?

279
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:07,493
No.

280
00:18:07,567 --> 00:18:09,034
Well, I have.

281
00:18:09,102 --> 00:18:11,570
But it'll be gone in an hour.

282
00:18:11,638 --> 00:18:13,606
Have a brioche.

283
00:18:13,673 --> 00:18:14,901
I can't eat.

284
00:18:14,975 --> 00:18:17,443
Well, drink your coffee
and have a cigarette.

285
00:18:17,511 --> 00:18:19,376
That's a soldier's breakfast.

286
00:18:20,647 --> 00:18:22,239
I think...

287
00:18:23,817 --> 00:18:25,250
What do you think?

288
00:18:25,318 --> 00:18:28,583
I think I should be going.

289
00:18:28,655 --> 00:18:29,849
Back to your hotel?

290
00:18:31,858 --> 00:18:33,120
Perhaps you should.

291
00:18:33,193 --> 00:18:35,627
You've got to face it,
whatever it is, sometime.

292
00:18:35,695 --> 00:18:37,993
Things may look different
to him in daylight.

293
00:18:43,403 --> 00:18:44,700
What's the matter?

294
00:18:46,006 --> 00:18:47,667
Did I say something wrong?

295
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:51,108
He's dead.

296
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,448
He died last night.

297
00:18:58,518 --> 00:19:01,043
Then I ran away.

298
00:19:02,556 --> 00:19:03,921
That makes it perfect.

299
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:05,981
Did you kill him?

300
00:19:13,467 --> 00:19:15,492
That makes it less perfect.

301
00:19:15,569 --> 00:19:17,503
You'd better tell me the details.

302
00:19:17,571 --> 00:19:21,940
He died...

303
00:19:22,008 --> 00:19:23,771
suddenly.

304
00:19:23,844 --> 00:19:26,005
Are you sure you didn't kill him?

305
00:19:28,582 --> 00:19:32,382
I didn't shoot him or stab him,
if that's what you mean.

306
00:19:32,452 --> 00:19:34,579
All right, he died naturally.
He was sick.

307
00:19:34,654 --> 00:19:36,053
Did you have a doctor?

308
00:19:36,122 --> 00:19:39,353
I called one, but he wouldn't
let the doctor touch him.

309
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:41,018
Why not?

310
00:19:43,029 --> 00:19:44,519
Because of me.

311
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:51,196
Did you notify the management
of the hotel he was dead?

312
00:19:51,271 --> 00:19:52,329
No.

313
00:19:52,405 --> 00:19:54,464
That makes it perfect again.

314
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,736
Why the devil didn't you give me a choice?

315
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:59,404
If I'd known, I would have
left you on the bridge.

316
00:19:59,479 --> 00:20:00,810
I'm sorry. I'll go.

317
00:20:00,881 --> 00:20:02,041
Oh, no, you won't go.

318
00:20:02,115 --> 00:20:04,811
The police will want to know
where you spent the night.

319
00:20:04,885 --> 00:20:06,147
I won't tell them.

320
00:20:06,219 --> 00:20:07,481
If you went there alone,

321
00:20:07,554 --> 00:20:09,954
they will be knocking
on my door ten minutes later.

322
00:20:10,023 --> 00:20:11,149
No, no, no, wait.

323
00:20:11,224 --> 00:20:12,816
I'll get dressed and go with you.

324
00:20:12,893 --> 00:20:14,554
You don't have
to help me anymore.

325
00:20:14,628 --> 00:20:16,255
I'm not helping you,
I'm helping myself.

326
00:20:16,329 --> 00:20:18,695
This is not my year to see the police.

327
00:20:21,234 --> 00:20:23,862
Was he your husband?

328
00:20:23,937 --> 00:20:25,336
No.

329
00:20:36,983 --> 00:20:38,245
So you're back.

330
00:20:38,318 --> 00:20:39,580
You think you can disappear

331
00:20:39,653 --> 00:20:41,348
and leave me to answer
questions to the police?

332
00:20:41,421 --> 00:20:44,584
You disgraced my hotel with that...
that thing you left upstairs.

333
00:20:44,658 --> 00:20:47,126
You believe, no doubt,
that I've settled this whole mess for you.

334
00:20:47,193 --> 00:20:49,093
Well, I haven't.
You're back to go to prison.

335
00:20:49,162 --> 00:20:50,959
- And if I have anything...
- You come from China?

336
00:20:51,965 --> 00:20:52,897
What do you mean?

337
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:55,025
Nothing. I just wanted to interrupt you.

338
00:20:55,101 --> 00:20:57,535
You would've gone on talking
for another hour.

339
00:21:04,177 --> 00:21:05,735
Sit down over there.

340
00:21:08,848 --> 00:21:11,043
Do you know the name
of the doctor who was here?

341
00:21:11,117 --> 00:21:12,914
Bonet. Marcel Bonet.

342
00:21:12,986 --> 00:21:14,453
Passi 2743.

343
00:21:14,521 --> 00:21:17,513
Phone Dr. Bonet to come right over
and sign the death certificate.

344
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:18,683
Get out.

345
00:21:18,758 --> 00:21:20,316
Why do you stand around stealing my time?

346
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:21,621
Get out!

347
00:21:21,695 --> 00:21:23,458
And close the door behind you,

348
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:26,693
unless you want the people
from the street to come in here, too.

349
00:21:36,042 --> 00:21:37,031
Well...

350
00:21:38,545 --> 00:21:41,378
There doesn't seem to be
any sign of violence.

351
00:21:51,725 --> 00:21:53,716
Why did you run away last night?

352
00:21:55,395 --> 00:21:58,125
When I came back, he was dead.

353
00:21:58,198 --> 00:21:59,165
Back from where?

354
00:21:59,232 --> 00:22:01,325
We quarreled.

355
00:22:01,401 --> 00:22:02,493
What about?

356
00:22:04,237 --> 00:22:05,329
The doctor.

357
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:07,168
Oh. The doctor again.

358
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,936
All right. Now, look.
The police will want to make a list

359
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,477
of what belonged to each of you.

360
00:22:11,544 --> 00:22:14,012
Did he have any relatives?

361
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,445
Not in France.

362
00:22:15,515 --> 00:22:17,449
Take everything
that's important to you, and quickly.

363
00:22:17,517 --> 00:22:19,712
There's no time left for sentimentality.

364
00:22:19,786 --> 00:22:21,253
Where is his luggage?

365
00:22:22,589 --> 00:22:24,523
It was over there
by the wall last night.

366
00:22:24,591 --> 00:22:27,583
Oh, I see. The proprietor.

367
00:22:27,661 --> 00:22:30,858
Mother, you are much
too inquisitive for your age.

368
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:32,591
Get me the proprietor, please.

369
00:22:36,936 --> 00:22:38,767
He said I only sent for the doctor

370
00:22:38,838 --> 00:22:40,772
because I wanted him to get well.

371
00:22:43,343 --> 00:22:46,710
I'll see that you get
the first prize for incoherence.

372
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,906
I was taking care of him,

373
00:22:47,981 --> 00:22:50,609
but he said I only wanted him
to get well so I could leave him.

374
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:55,881
- Did you?
- Yes.

375
00:22:57,290 --> 00:23:00,191
Well, you have definitely left him now.

376
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:02,454
No, I haven't.

377
00:23:03,463 --> 00:23:05,431
I haven't. Not this way.

378
00:23:05,498 --> 00:23:06,795
Why did you want to leave him?

379
00:23:07,967 --> 00:23:09,298
He loved me.

380
00:23:13,807 --> 00:23:15,468
But I didn't love him.

381
00:23:23,983 --> 00:23:26,076
Where are the suitcases?

382
00:23:26,152 --> 00:23:27,244
First, the bill.

383
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:28,582
First, the suitcases.

384
00:23:28,655 --> 00:23:31,749
No one has refused to pay the bill... yet.

385
00:23:31,825 --> 00:23:33,986
And next time, knock before you enter.

386
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:39,491
Did he keep any money in his suitcases?

387
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:42,157
Why, I don't know.

388
00:23:42,235 --> 00:23:44,032
Marino always had money in his wallet.

389
00:23:44,104 --> 00:23:45,128
Where is it?

390
00:23:46,673 --> 00:23:48,834
He kept it under his pillow.

391
00:24:01,187 --> 00:24:03,280
American money.

392
00:24:03,356 --> 00:24:04,618
A hundred dollars.

393
00:24:04,691 --> 00:24:07,023
I left the wallet where I found it.
Take it.

394
00:24:08,628 --> 00:24:10,619
You can live on this for a while.

395
00:24:10,697 --> 00:24:13,063
Otherwise, it will rot
at police headquarters.

396
00:24:15,368 --> 00:24:16,801
Thank you.

397
00:24:16,870 --> 00:24:17,894
Come in.

398
00:24:22,208 --> 00:24:23,402
Are these all?

399
00:24:23,476 --> 00:24:25,205
Naturally these are all.

400
00:24:26,312 --> 00:24:27,643
Is the bill right?

401
00:24:27,714 --> 00:24:29,511
Well, pay it anyway.

402
00:24:29,582 --> 00:24:31,573
Uh, 297.

403
00:24:34,888 --> 00:24:36,617
- One...
- One...

404
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:40,052
300 francs.

405
00:24:40,126 --> 00:24:41,650
300 francs.

406
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:43,593
We get three francs change.

407
00:24:43,663 --> 00:24:44,891
The concierge?

408
00:24:44,964 --> 00:24:46,659
That we'll settle ourselves.

409
00:24:50,236 --> 00:24:51,294
Thank you.

410
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,208
Now the suitcases.

411
00:24:56,276 --> 00:24:58,005
You may find something you'd want.

412
00:24:59,012 --> 00:25:00,172
Well...

413
00:25:00,246 --> 00:25:01,770
the rest is for the police.

414
00:25:01,848 --> 00:25:05,841
When one is dead,
one becomes very important.

415
00:25:05,919 --> 00:25:08,717
Would you like to go downstairs
and wait for the police there?

416
00:25:08,788 --> 00:25:10,779
No. I'll stay here.

417
00:25:10,857 --> 00:25:12,415
There is nothing to do here.

418
00:25:12,492 --> 00:25:14,357
I know, but...

419
00:25:14,427 --> 00:25:16,657
he won't be here much longer.

420
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:18,526
I often...

421
00:25:20,934 --> 00:25:23,095
He wasn't very happy with me.

422
00:25:23,169 --> 00:25:24,761
I was often away.

423
00:25:25,939 --> 00:25:27,531
Now I'll stay.

424
00:25:27,607 --> 00:25:29,541
He won't know.

425
00:25:29,609 --> 00:25:31,304
It's not that.

426
00:25:31,377 --> 00:25:33,641
All right. Well, I'll watch the proceedings

427
00:25:33,713 --> 00:25:35,180
from the bistro across the street.

428
00:25:35,248 --> 00:25:36,306
Here.

429
00:25:36,382 --> 00:25:38,077
Come to the window
when the police have gone.

430
00:25:38,151 --> 00:25:40,517
I'll come to the window
in my room on the floor above.

431
00:26:22,328 --> 00:26:23,590
Did it go well?

432
00:26:23,663 --> 00:26:25,096
There was no trouble.

433
00:26:25,164 --> 00:26:26,461
What are you going to do now?

434
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:29,468
I don't know.

435
00:26:30,904 --> 00:26:33,600
I suppose you don't want
to stay on in this hotel.

436
00:26:33,673 --> 00:26:34,935
No.

437
00:26:35,008 --> 00:26:36,669
You should try the Hotel de Milan.

438
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:37,903
It's clean and decent.

439
00:26:39,045 --> 00:26:40,740
Couldn't I go to the hotel where...

440
00:26:41,848 --> 00:26:42,837
To your hotel?

441
00:26:44,183 --> 00:26:45,582
The International?

442
00:26:46,586 --> 00:26:47,951
Yes, l...

443
00:26:48,021 --> 00:26:49,352
I know it somehow now.

444
00:26:49,422 --> 00:26:51,117
It's better than what I haven't seen.

445
00:26:52,692 --> 00:26:56,651
Well, the International
is not the right hotel for you.

446
00:26:59,699 --> 00:27:01,462
You're right. I'll go to the other.

447
00:27:18,718 --> 00:27:19,980
Is this all right?

448
00:27:20,053 --> 00:27:21,987
Yes. Very good.

449
00:27:22,055 --> 00:27:24,148
At least it seems to be clean.

450
00:27:24,223 --> 00:27:25,212
Yes.

451
00:27:37,403 --> 00:27:38,961
I think you'll be all right here.

452
00:27:39,038 --> 00:27:41,165
Yes, thanks. Many thanks.

453
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,174
You should go to bed.

454
00:27:43,242 --> 00:27:45,506
Do you think you'll be able to sleep?

455
00:27:45,578 --> 00:27:46,636
I'll try.

456
00:27:47,747 --> 00:27:49,681
Well, I'll go now.

457
00:27:49,749 --> 00:27:51,580
I'll look you up one of these days.

458
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:03,023
What's your name?

459
00:28:03,096 --> 00:28:04,028
Madou.

460
00:28:04,097 --> 00:28:05,121
Joan Madou.

461
00:28:05,198 --> 00:28:06,358
Joan Madou.

462
00:28:06,432 --> 00:28:08,024
I'll remember it.

463
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:10,899
Well, perhaps I'd better write it down.

464
00:28:11,938 --> 00:28:13,530
Here.

465
00:28:13,606 --> 00:28:15,540
You write it yourself.

466
00:28:15,608 --> 00:28:16,632
It's simpler.

467
00:28:21,414 --> 00:28:23,177
Now go to bed.

468
00:28:23,249 --> 00:28:24,978
All you need is a little time,

469
00:28:25,051 --> 00:28:27,383
a certain amount of time
that you have to get through.

470
00:28:27,453 --> 00:28:29,216
You understand.

471
00:28:29,288 --> 00:28:30,550
Yes.

472
00:28:30,623 --> 00:28:33,387
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

473
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:36,257
I really don't know what
I would have done without you.

474
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:37,728
I really don't know.

475
00:29:13,166 --> 00:29:15,100
Spain, the fascist section,

476
00:29:15,168 --> 00:29:17,762
celebrating a German or Italian victory

477
00:29:17,837 --> 00:29:19,270
over their own people.

478
00:29:29,015 --> 00:29:30,414
This was left for Dr. Ravic.

479
00:29:30,483 --> 00:29:31,950
Here.

480
00:29:32,018 --> 00:29:34,213
I'm not expecting a package.
Who brought it?

481
00:29:34,287 --> 00:29:35,584
A woman. A... A lady.

482
00:29:35,655 --> 00:29:37,020
Well, which, woman or lady?

483
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,148
Just... Just in between.

484
00:29:38,224 --> 00:29:40,419
- Pretty sharp, eh?
- There's no name on it.

485
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:42,586
- Did she say it was for me?
- Not just like that.

486
00:29:42,662 --> 00:29:44,425
She said it was for
the doctor who lives here.

487
00:29:44,497 --> 00:29:45,327
You know the lady.

488
00:29:45,398 --> 00:29:46,956
She was here with you the other morning.

489
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:50,963
First virtue of hotel employees
is discretion.

490
00:29:51,037 --> 00:29:52,561
Indiscretion is only for gentlemen.

491
00:30:00,213 --> 00:30:02,647
Lieutenant Navarro,
aide-de-camp to Colonel Gómez.

492
00:30:02,715 --> 00:30:04,979
The colonel requests you
to drink a glass of wine with him.

493
00:30:05,051 --> 00:30:07,349
We are about to play game of chess.

494
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,854
You did a service for Colonel Gómez
some time ago.

495
00:30:09,922 --> 00:30:11,549
This match must not be postponed.

496
00:30:11,624 --> 00:30:13,888
Oh, no. It's for the championship.

497
00:30:18,664 --> 00:30:22,259
What service did you render
this tin soldier?

498
00:30:22,335 --> 00:30:24,098
I prescribed a laxative for him.

499
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:26,832
A fascist in the same situation

500
00:30:26,906 --> 00:30:29,898
would have prescribed
for a Democrat a poison.

501
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:32,775
What's this? From a Russian?

502
00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:35,279
No. Oh, I told you about her.

503
00:30:35,348 --> 00:30:37,282
So she's the one.

504
00:30:37,350 --> 00:30:38,544
Yes.

505
00:30:38,618 --> 00:30:40,586
It's a busy day, eh? Come in.

506
00:30:41,587 --> 00:30:42,884
I'm Captain Gonzales.

507
00:30:42,955 --> 00:30:45,082
We are leaving tonight
to join the glorious army

508
00:30:45,158 --> 00:30:46,455
of Generalissimo Franco.

509
00:30:46,526 --> 00:30:50,018
The colonel would like to drink with you
to Spain and Spain's army.

510
00:30:50,096 --> 00:30:51,996
Captain, I'm not a...

511
00:30:52,064 --> 00:30:52,996
a Spaniard.

512
00:30:53,065 --> 00:30:55,033
We know that.
You are an Austrian.

513
00:30:55,101 --> 00:30:56,193
That makes you German.

514
00:30:56,269 --> 00:30:57,861
Germany and Spain are friends.

515
00:30:58,905 --> 00:30:59,997
Please give our regrets

516
00:31:00,072 --> 00:31:02,131
to Colonel Gómez,
but the results of our game

517
00:31:02,208 --> 00:31:04,904
must be cabled tonight
to New York and Calcutta.

518
00:31:04,977 --> 00:31:06,376
We expected you to decline.

519
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:08,470
We only invited you
because you are with the doctor.

520
00:31:08,548 --> 00:31:10,311
Don't you think we've had
about enough of this?

521
00:31:10,383 --> 00:31:11,577
Yes, Colonel.

522
00:31:11,651 --> 00:31:14,677
I think the simplest thing
is that you go back to your friends.

523
00:31:16,956 --> 00:31:18,116
Thank you.

524
00:31:18,191 --> 00:31:20,955
Thank you for promoting me
to rank of full colonel.

525
00:31:21,027 --> 00:31:25,088
Well, I knew, of course, that you were
only a miserable lieutenant-colonel,

526
00:31:25,164 --> 00:31:27,029
but it seems unbearable to me

527
00:31:27,099 --> 00:31:29,624
that you shouldn't have
the same rank as this Gómez.

528
00:31:30,803 --> 00:31:32,737
Have you, uh...

529
00:31:32,805 --> 00:31:34,329
Have you seen her again?

530
00:31:34,407 --> 00:31:35,396
No.

531
00:31:35,474 --> 00:31:39,205
Uh. This, of course, is a cry for help.

532
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:42,413
Hmm. I suppose so.

533
00:31:42,481 --> 00:31:44,005
Go see her, Ravic.

534
00:31:44,083 --> 00:31:45,072
Why?

535
00:31:45,151 --> 00:31:48,245
Well, because the colonel says so.

536
00:31:49,989 --> 00:31:52,389
All right, all right.
I'll go and see her tomorrow.

537
00:31:56,662 --> 00:31:57,754
Colonel Gómez.

538
00:31:57,830 --> 00:31:58,956
This will be discussion

539
00:31:59,031 --> 00:32:00,896
between two colonels, a short one.

540
00:32:03,669 --> 00:32:05,432
- Gentlemen...
- Make no statement.

541
00:32:05,504 --> 00:32:07,096
It will only cause conflict.

542
00:32:07,173 --> 00:32:08,435
Now get out.

543
00:32:08,507 --> 00:32:10,441
You should've got out
long ago, you know...

544
00:32:10,509 --> 00:32:12,409
to Spain, to fight.

545
00:32:12,478 --> 00:32:15,936
Germans and Italians
have fought for you there instead.

546
00:32:17,016 --> 00:32:18,483
I am unable to challenge you.

547
00:32:18,551 --> 00:32:19,813
I am leaving Paris tonight.

548
00:32:21,454 --> 00:32:23,445
The fee for your consultation.

549
00:32:23,522 --> 00:32:25,285
No. One moment.

550
00:32:25,358 --> 00:32:26,586
One moment, please.

551
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:36,058
That is to sober you up! Now get out!

552
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:37,864
And remember in the future
not to throw money,

553
00:32:37,937 --> 00:32:38,869
you medieval idiots!

554
00:32:38,938 --> 00:32:39,962
Get out!

555
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:41,529
Get out, get out!

556
00:32:43,876 --> 00:32:44,934
You.

557
00:32:46,579 --> 00:32:49,173
If only you were not illegal,

558
00:32:49,248 --> 00:32:51,773
I could've committed
magnificent damage.

559
00:32:51,851 --> 00:32:53,512
God bless your eyes.

560
00:32:53,586 --> 00:32:54,814
- And yours.
- Right.

561
00:32:58,224 --> 00:32:59,987
The lady's in her room.

562
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:01,526
Uh, what's the number?

563
00:33:01,594 --> 00:33:02,822
27.

564
00:33:04,563 --> 00:33:06,326
I don't remember her name.

565
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:07,331
Madou.

566
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:08,992
Oh, yes, yes. Joan Madou.

567
00:33:09,068 --> 00:33:10,899
I don't think it's her real name.

568
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:12,164
Why don't you think so?

569
00:33:12,238 --> 00:33:14,069
She registered as an actress.

570
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:17,598
Oh. I knew an actor
who called himself Gustav Schmidt.

571
00:33:17,677 --> 00:33:21,670
His real name was Alexander Maria,
Count of Zambona.

572
00:33:21,747 --> 00:33:23,305
Nowadays, so many things happen.

573
00:33:23,382 --> 00:33:25,782
Mmm, so much does not
actually happen.

574
00:33:25,851 --> 00:33:27,716
Thanks, but for me, it's enough.

575
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:30,017
For me, too. 27, you said.

576
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:31,147
Yes, sir.

577
00:33:33,426 --> 00:33:34,518
Come in.

578
00:33:36,662 --> 00:33:38,687
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

579
00:33:38,764 --> 00:33:40,322
No. Please come in.

580
00:33:42,268 --> 00:33:43,530
Won't you sit down?

581
00:33:45,271 --> 00:33:48,069
Was this here when you moved in?

582
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,005
I had it put there.

583
00:33:50,076 --> 00:33:51,703
I hate a bed...

584
00:33:51,777 --> 00:33:53,745
in the daytime.

585
00:33:57,616 --> 00:33:58,742
Were you going out?

586
00:34:00,786 --> 00:34:02,378
Later.

587
00:34:02,455 --> 00:34:04,548
Nowhere in particular.

588
00:34:04,623 --> 00:34:08,389
I don't know anyone
except the proprietor, the waiter,

589
00:34:08,461 --> 00:34:10,452
the chambermaid, and you.

590
00:34:12,898 --> 00:34:14,798
It's time you got out of here. Come.

591
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:17,359
We'll have something to eat.

592
00:34:19,138 --> 00:34:21,106
It's good to sit this way.

593
00:34:22,174 --> 00:34:25,575
You came to me out of pity,
but it means a great deal to me.

594
00:34:25,644 --> 00:34:27,635
Have you thought about
what you're going to do?

595
00:34:29,148 --> 00:34:30,740
No. Not yet.

596
00:34:32,485 --> 00:34:35,682
Well, the porter told me
that you were an actress

597
00:34:35,755 --> 00:34:37,245
when I asked for your name.

598
00:34:39,158 --> 00:34:40,591
You had forgotten it.

599
00:34:41,827 --> 00:34:43,590
Yes. Well, no.

600
00:34:43,662 --> 00:34:46,358
Uh, I'd left the slip of paper in my hotel.

601
00:34:46,432 --> 00:34:48,525
You remember it now?

602
00:34:48,601 --> 00:34:50,592
Yes. Joan. Joan Madou.

603
00:34:53,339 --> 00:34:56,069
I'm not a good actress.
I've only played small parts.

604
00:34:57,176 --> 00:34:58,609
In Italy.

605
00:34:58,677 --> 00:34:59,735
Are you Italian?

606
00:35:00,846 --> 00:35:03,110
My mother is Italian.
My father was Romanian.

607
00:35:04,283 --> 00:35:07,150
My mother is still in Italy, I think.

608
00:35:07,219 --> 00:35:09,779
Have you done anything else
besides small parts?

609
00:35:09,855 --> 00:35:11,015
Some singing.

610
00:35:12,224 --> 00:35:13,555
Do you speak any Russian?

611
00:35:13,626 --> 00:35:17,062
No, but I sing in Russian.
Gypsy songs.

612
00:35:17,129 --> 00:35:18,790
It might be easier.

613
00:35:18,864 --> 00:35:20,764
I know someone who may help you.

614
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:21,765
Who?

615
00:35:21,834 --> 00:35:23,768
Someone very important.

616
00:35:23,836 --> 00:35:25,963
Colonel Boris Morosov.

617
00:35:26,038 --> 00:35:28,097
He's a doorman at the Sheherazade.

618
00:35:29,208 --> 00:35:31,369
Some doormen can do a lot.

619
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:48,089
Come out of that rain
and kiss me, you doter.

620
00:35:55,401 --> 00:35:57,369
Doctor, I'm surprised to see you here.

621
00:35:57,436 --> 00:35:58,698
I forced him, Boris.

622
00:35:58,771 --> 00:36:00,932
This is my first night back in Paris.

623
00:36:01,006 --> 00:36:02,871
Thank the stars I'm with you again.

624
00:36:02,942 --> 00:36:05,137
Katya, you have a Russian soul!

625
00:36:05,211 --> 00:36:07,873
Why did you have to be born
in that Boston?

626
00:36:07,947 --> 00:36:10,507
Nature went mad that day, Boris.

627
00:36:13,752 --> 00:36:15,652
You have not been around
since you sent me

628
00:36:15,721 --> 00:36:17,086
this Joan Madou. Why?

629
00:36:17,156 --> 00:36:18,555
What is the matter with her?

630
00:36:18,624 --> 00:36:20,615
She's alone and hates it.

631
00:36:20,693 --> 00:36:23,093
I'm alone, and I intend to stay that way.

632
00:39:19,138 --> 00:39:20,730
What's the matter, Ravic?

633
00:39:23,475 --> 00:39:24,965
Do you know that woman?

634
00:39:25,044 --> 00:39:26,033
No.

635
00:39:49,334 --> 00:39:50,266
Good evening.

636
00:39:50,335 --> 00:39:51,267
You're alone.

637
00:39:51,336 --> 00:39:52,428
Yes.

638
00:39:52,504 --> 00:39:54,699
Oh, please. Do sit down.

639
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:57,266
I'll do it.

640
00:39:57,342 --> 00:39:59,139
Uh, bring another glass, please.

641
00:40:01,847 --> 00:40:05,112
This is vodka.
I don't know if you drink it.

642
00:40:05,184 --> 00:40:07,118
We drank it at the Belle Aurore.

643
00:40:08,187 --> 00:40:09,347
That's right.

644
00:40:18,831 --> 00:40:21,299
I haven't heard that for a long time.

645
00:40:31,543 --> 00:40:33,636
Well, shall we go on with this, or...

646
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,278
- What was it we drank?
- When?

647
00:40:37,349 --> 00:40:40,284
The first night.
It was the warmest thing I've ever had.

648
00:40:40,352 --> 00:40:41,979
Where did we drink it?

649
00:40:42,054 --> 00:40:43,988
In that little bistro near the Arch.

650
00:40:44,056 --> 00:40:46,183
Where the waiter had a woman
tattooed on his arm.

651
00:40:46,258 --> 00:40:48,988
Oh. Now I know.
It must have been Calvados.

652
00:40:49,061 --> 00:40:50,494
Apple brandy from Normandy.

653
00:40:50,562 --> 00:40:53,588
Uh, waiter, have you Calvados?

654
00:40:53,665 --> 00:40:55,462
Uh... no. Sorry.

655
00:40:55,534 --> 00:40:57,195
No one ever ask for it.

656
00:40:57,269 --> 00:40:58,429
You see?

657
00:40:58,504 --> 00:41:00,665
This place is too elegant.

658
00:41:00,739 --> 00:41:05,802
Well, the simplest thing would be
to go to that other place again.

659
00:41:06,812 --> 00:41:08,609
I'm through for the evening.

660
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:09,977
Fine.

661
00:41:12,918 --> 00:41:14,351
Waiter.

662
00:41:14,419 --> 00:41:15,852
Check, please.

663
00:41:15,921 --> 00:41:16,945
Thank you.

664
00:41:20,259 --> 00:41:21,692
- Flowers?
- No, thank you.

665
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:23,523
Cab, monsieur?

666
00:41:23,595 --> 00:41:25,722
- If you please, Colonel.
- Yes, sir.

667
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:31,262
Mother? Roses.

668
00:41:36,608 --> 00:41:38,576
Tonight I love you.

669
00:41:38,644 --> 00:41:39,838
Thank you, Colonel.

670
00:41:41,747 --> 00:41:42,679
What's the joke?

671
00:41:42,748 --> 00:41:44,375
The joke, my boy,

672
00:41:44,449 --> 00:41:46,576
is that man is great in his intentions

673
00:41:46,652 --> 00:41:48,483
but weak in carrying them out.

674
00:41:48,554 --> 00:41:50,988
Therein lies our misery
and our charm.

675
00:41:51,056 --> 00:41:53,115
God bless your eyes.

676
00:41:53,192 --> 00:41:54,989
- Good night.
- Good night.

677
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,118
Drive on.

678
00:41:57,963 --> 00:41:59,396
That's it.

679
00:41:59,464 --> 00:42:01,557
That's where you sat the last time.

680
00:42:01,633 --> 00:42:02,895
You still remember?

681
00:42:02,968 --> 00:42:05,061
Perfectly. I never forget anything.

682
00:42:05,137 --> 00:42:06,570
Do you remember what we drank?

683
00:42:06,638 --> 00:42:07,570
Calvados.

684
00:42:07,639 --> 00:42:09,664
Right. We'd like to repeat it now.

685
00:42:11,643 --> 00:42:13,634
We'll see if it has the same taste.

686
00:42:15,914 --> 00:42:16,903
Double.

687
00:42:16,982 --> 00:42:18,973
You ordered double Calvados then.

688
00:42:20,652 --> 00:42:23,917
You know, you're gradually
giving me an uneasy feeling.

689
00:42:23,989 --> 00:42:25,752
Do you remember
how we were dressed?

690
00:42:25,824 --> 00:42:27,951
Raincoats.
The lady wore a basque beret.

691
00:42:28,026 --> 00:42:29,823
It's a pity you have to be here.

692
00:42:29,895 --> 00:42:30,827
You belong in vaudeville.

693
00:42:30,896 --> 00:42:32,830
I used to be. Circus.

694
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:34,331
I told you before.

695
00:42:38,003 --> 00:42:40,096
This gentleman has a bad memory.

696
00:42:41,106 --> 00:42:44,200
He's an expert at forgetting,
just as you're an expert at not forgetting.

697
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:47,007
Perhaps not, after all.

698
00:42:56,188 --> 00:42:57,450
Does it taste as good?

699
00:42:59,858 --> 00:43:00,847
Better.

700
00:43:04,529 --> 00:43:05,518
Want another?

701
00:43:07,699 --> 00:43:09,030
Would you like to leave?

702
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:16,266
Waiter.

703
00:43:19,378 --> 00:43:21,141
These are what you had the last time.

704
00:43:21,213 --> 00:43:22,202
Are they?

705
00:43:22,281 --> 00:43:25,148
Yes, he's right. Laurents, Green.

706
00:43:25,217 --> 00:43:29,153
You see? The lady has
a better memory than you have, sir.

707
00:43:29,221 --> 00:43:30,711
That's yet to be proven.

708
00:43:34,393 --> 00:43:35,519
- Thank you.
- Good night.

709
00:43:35,594 --> 00:43:36,583
Good night.

710
00:43:40,899 --> 00:43:42,764
I'll take you to your hotel.

711
00:43:45,904 --> 00:43:47,166
Taxi.

712
00:44:15,767 --> 00:44:17,598
I'm afraid the gentleman was right...

713
00:44:17,669 --> 00:44:19,102
about memory, I mean.

714
00:44:21,306 --> 00:44:22,238
Here.

715
00:44:22,307 --> 00:44:23,296
Thank you.

716
00:44:31,283 --> 00:44:32,944
Oh, Dr. Gunther.

717
00:44:34,353 --> 00:44:36,719
Alvarez. Jaime Alvarez.

718
00:44:36,788 --> 00:44:38,153
Don't you remember?

719
00:44:43,729 --> 00:44:44,957
Remember now?

720
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,729
On a kitchen table.

721
00:44:49,801 --> 00:44:52,736
A temporary field hospital.

722
00:44:52,804 --> 00:44:54,066
At Aranjuez.

723
00:44:54,139 --> 00:44:56,164
A little white cottage in an almond grove.

724
00:44:56,241 --> 00:44:58,232
Yes, yes, I remember.

725
00:44:59,277 --> 00:45:01,905
Oh, Alvarez, this is Miss Madou.

726
00:45:04,616 --> 00:45:06,641
How is the leg now?

727
00:45:06,718 --> 00:45:08,242
I can bend it completely.

728
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:10,220
It was good enough
to take me over the Pyrenees.

729
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:14,184
- It's all right.
- It's all over now.

730
00:45:14,259 --> 00:45:16,750
Those of us who can are getting out.

731
00:45:16,828 --> 00:45:18,295
- You're lucky to be here.
- Yes.

732
00:45:18,363 --> 00:45:19,887
- Where are you staying?
- Here.

733
00:45:19,965 --> 00:45:22,900
Beds, Doctor. Real beds.

734
00:45:22,968 --> 00:45:26,404
It's a nice hotel.
Just got in this morning.

735
00:45:27,739 --> 00:45:29,036
How are things here?

736
00:45:29,107 --> 00:45:32,668
Oh, fine. The frontiers
are guarded by mere words.

737
00:45:32,744 --> 00:45:34,575
The enemy will never break through.

738
00:45:34,646 --> 00:45:36,375
- Same all over again.
- Maybe.

739
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:38,880
Would you like a drink?

740
00:45:38,950 --> 00:45:42,078
Not now. There are things I have to do.

741
00:45:42,154 --> 00:45:44,520
But we'll meet again.

742
00:45:52,964 --> 00:45:55,023
You've hardly said a word
since we left the hotel.

743
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:57,034
Is it because of that man?

744
00:46:01,606 --> 00:46:02,971
He called you Gunther.

745
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:05,009
- Yes, I know.
- Why did he do that?

746
00:46:05,077 --> 00:46:06,305
Is your name Gunther?

747
00:46:06,378 --> 00:46:08,141
My name is Ravic.

748
00:46:08,213 --> 00:46:09,339
But he knew you.

749
00:46:09,414 --> 00:46:11,746
Joan, names are unimportant.

750
00:46:11,817 --> 00:46:14,513
Never bother yourself about names.

751
00:46:16,755 --> 00:46:18,052
What's the matter?

752
00:46:18,123 --> 00:46:21,957
Nothing. I'm happy.
I told you I'm in love.

753
00:46:23,895 --> 00:46:25,624
Have you been happy often?

754
00:46:27,065 --> 00:46:29,226
Have you?

755
00:46:29,301 --> 00:46:30,598
Not often.

756
00:46:30,669 --> 00:46:32,864
When was the last time?

757
00:46:32,938 --> 00:46:34,701
Why do you ask me?

758
00:46:34,773 --> 00:46:36,764
Oh, just to ask something.

759
00:46:38,443 --> 00:46:39,705
Two years ago.

760
00:46:42,581 --> 00:46:44,071
It didn't last long.

761
00:46:44,149 --> 00:46:46,014
Why not?

762
00:46:46,084 --> 00:46:47,244
He made terrible scenes.

763
00:46:47,319 --> 00:46:49,082
He didn't understand
I no longer loved him.

764
00:46:50,255 --> 00:46:52,780
One never understands that.

765
00:46:52,858 --> 00:46:56,294
You would understand.
But then I would always love you.

766
00:46:56,361 --> 00:46:59,262
You're different.
Everything with us is different.

767
00:46:59,331 --> 00:47:02,300
He wanted to kill me.

768
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:04,198
They always talk about it,
but they never do.

769
00:47:07,506 --> 00:47:09,701
You wouldn't want to kill me.

770
00:47:11,143 --> 00:47:13,236
Your conversation
is becoming more human.

771
00:47:13,311 --> 00:47:15,074
For a moment,
I was pretty frightened.

772
00:47:15,147 --> 00:47:16,842
Because I love you?

773
00:47:17,949 --> 00:47:19,576
Oh, we won't start that again.

774
00:47:19,651 --> 00:47:22,518
We won't start what again?

775
00:47:22,587 --> 00:47:23,918
Has anyone you loved ever told you

776
00:47:23,989 --> 00:47:25,183
that he no longer loved you?

777
00:47:27,325 --> 00:47:28,724
Yes.

778
00:47:28,793 --> 00:47:30,283
What did you do?

779
00:47:30,362 --> 00:47:33,388
Everything, but it didn't help.

780
00:47:33,465 --> 00:47:36,298
- I was terribly unhappy.
- For long?

781
00:47:36,368 --> 00:47:38,859
A week. About a week.

782
00:47:38,937 --> 00:47:40,928
That's not very long.

783
00:47:41,006 --> 00:47:42,633
It's an eternity if you're really unhappy.

784
00:47:42,707 --> 00:47:46,108
I was so filled with unhappiness
that nothing else existed.

785
00:47:46,178 --> 00:47:48,908
And, if nothing else exists,

786
00:47:48,980 --> 00:47:51,039
there is nothing left
with which to compare it.

787
00:47:52,851 --> 00:47:55,786
All one can do is to start to live again.

788
00:47:58,990 --> 00:48:00,651
What are you thinking of?

789
00:48:00,725 --> 00:48:02,989
Of how dangerous you are, Joan.

790
00:48:03,061 --> 00:48:05,621
I'm not dangerous.

791
00:48:05,697 --> 00:48:08,427
The fact that you think that is part of it.

792
00:48:14,573 --> 00:48:16,564
- You must be tired.
- No, I'm not tired.

793
00:48:16,641 --> 00:48:18,541
- Been walking for miles.
- You didn't answer my question.

794
00:48:18,610 --> 00:48:20,373
What did you do in Spain?

795
00:48:20,445 --> 00:48:22,538
- Cut off legs.
- That's no answer.

796
00:48:22,614 --> 00:48:24,104
What kind of an answer do you want?

797
00:48:24,182 --> 00:48:26,980
- A true one.
- I gave you a true one.

798
00:48:27,052 --> 00:48:28,610
Something in you is closed, Ravic,

799
00:48:28,687 --> 00:48:30,382
and you won't let anyone or anything in.

800
00:48:30,455 --> 00:48:32,355
You're imagining things,
and I need a drink.

801
00:48:32,424 --> 00:48:34,119
Let's sit here.

802
00:48:39,931 --> 00:48:40,989
- Good evening.
- Coffee.

803
00:48:41,066 --> 00:48:43,432
- Coffee and brandy.
- Very good, sir.

804
00:48:43,501 --> 00:48:44,729
You drink too much.

805
00:48:44,803 --> 00:48:46,100
Possibly.

806
00:48:48,406 --> 00:48:51,637
Ravic, I'm in love.
I throw myself into it without a thought.

807
00:48:51,710 --> 00:48:53,234
I love you and I'm happy.

808
00:48:53,311 --> 00:48:54,300
I'm never cautious.

809
00:48:54,379 --> 00:48:56,643
I'm never afraid of...
of saying what I feel.

810
00:48:56,715 --> 00:48:58,080
But you put up a barrier.

811
00:48:58,149 --> 00:49:00,344
There's something in you that resists.

812
00:49:06,758 --> 00:49:08,055
What is it?

813
00:49:13,131 --> 00:49:15,122
Ravic!

814
00:49:33,618 --> 00:49:36,178
Ravic? Ravic, what is it?
You must tell me.

815
00:49:36,254 --> 00:49:37,744
I'm sorry, Joan. I'll get you a cab.

816
00:49:37,822 --> 00:49:39,881
I have something to do here.
Please go home.

817
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:40,947
Taxi!

818
00:49:41,026 --> 00:49:42,288
- Will I see you later tonight?
- No.

819
00:49:42,360 --> 00:49:45,022
Perhaps not for a few days.

820
00:49:45,096 --> 00:49:47,587
But why, Ravic?
You must tell me why.

821
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:49,964
I can't talk about it.

822
00:49:51,202 --> 00:49:52,134
All right.

823
00:49:52,203 --> 00:49:54,797
Please, don't be angry with me.

824
00:49:57,075 --> 00:49:59,407
How could I ever be angry with you?

825
00:50:06,551 --> 00:50:08,280
Hotel de Milan.

826
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:25,495
- Hakke?
- Yes. I lost him.

827
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:28,266
On the corner of Avenue Georges V
and Champs-Elysées.

828
00:50:28,340 --> 00:50:33,642
So. So the chances of meeting him
are not everywhere the same.

829
00:50:33,712 --> 00:50:35,441
I intend to look everywhere.

830
00:50:36,715 --> 00:50:39,843
Hey. Ravic, hey.

831
00:50:39,918 --> 00:50:42,978
If you are destined to meet this man,
you will meet him.

832
00:50:43,054 --> 00:50:44,419
Keep your eyes open everywhere.

833
00:50:44,489 --> 00:50:46,889
Be prepared for anything.

834
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:49,392
But otherwise,
go on living as if you're mistaken,

835
00:50:49,461 --> 00:50:50,792
or you'll drive yourself crazy.

836
00:50:50,862 --> 00:50:52,659
Thank you, Boris.

837
00:50:52,731 --> 00:50:54,596
No, no, no.

838
00:50:54,666 --> 00:50:57,692
Don't take the gun.
You'll get only trouble.

839
00:50:57,769 --> 00:51:00,704
Don't run any risks.
Don't be hero for nothing.

840
00:51:00,772 --> 00:51:04,401
Hey! You must go, eh?

841
00:51:04,476 --> 00:51:05,465
Yes.

842
00:51:07,612 --> 00:51:11,981
Don't shoot unless you are sure
you can escape, eh?

843
00:51:12,050 --> 00:51:13,745
This is your chance.

844
00:51:13,818 --> 00:51:15,149
Don't worry.

845
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:16,847
Oh, Boris, please. Put out the light.

846
00:51:16,921 --> 00:51:18,149
Oh. Yes.

847
00:51:56,628 --> 00:51:58,892
Good morning, Mr. Ravic.

848
00:52:02,867 --> 00:52:04,767
Miss Madou didn't go to work tonight.

849
00:52:04,836 --> 00:52:06,428
She's been in all evening.

850
00:52:06,504 --> 00:52:09,064
She's paying extra
for burning her lights all night.

851
00:52:09,140 --> 00:52:11,870
Can't sleep in a dark room, she says.

852
00:52:11,943 --> 00:52:14,275
Thank you.

853
00:52:49,647 --> 00:52:51,205
You came back because of me.

854
00:52:51,282 --> 00:52:53,341
Yes, Joan, because of you.
Only because of you.

855
00:52:55,153 --> 00:52:57,553
I don't ask anything more.
Only that you love me.

856
00:52:57,622 --> 00:53:00,489
I do. Without love, a man is dead.

857
00:53:00,558 --> 00:53:03,356
- I love you!
- A dead man on a furlough.

858
00:53:03,428 --> 00:53:05,896
Don't leave me again.

859
00:53:05,964 --> 00:53:08,558
Love me, love me, love me.

860
00:53:12,437 --> 00:53:15,600
Ravic, we've got to get out of this.

861
00:53:15,673 --> 00:53:17,140
We must get away from this hotel,

862
00:53:17,208 --> 00:53:18,869
away from the nightclub,
away from the town.

863
00:53:18,943 --> 00:53:22,174
Yes, we'll go away, we'll go away,
where the sun is.

864
00:53:22,247 --> 00:53:23,771
We'll wash the rain away.

865
00:53:23,848 --> 00:53:25,440
Wash the past, too.

866
00:53:25,517 --> 00:53:27,348
To Cannes or Antibes.

867
00:53:27,418 --> 00:53:29,283
- Have you ever been there?
- No.

868
00:53:29,354 --> 00:53:31,049
Then we'll go.

869
00:53:31,122 --> 00:53:32,646
Have we any money?

870
00:53:32,724 --> 00:53:35,887
Some. But in two or three weeks,
we'll have enough.

871
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,394
I have to open the stomach
of someone of importance.

872
00:53:38,463 --> 00:53:40,590
He'll provide the rest of the money.

873
00:53:40,665 --> 00:53:43,259
We'll live, Ravic, we'll live!

874
00:53:43,334 --> 00:53:46,360
We'll live. Only time dies.

875
00:53:46,437 --> 00:53:48,564
Look, I haven't a thing to wear.

876
00:54:17,969 --> 00:54:19,561
I saw you come out of the water.

877
00:54:19,637 --> 00:54:20,695
How could you?

878
00:54:20,772 --> 00:54:22,137
Then I covered my eyes.

879
00:54:22,206 --> 00:54:25,539
It was like Venus rising from the sea.

880
00:54:25,610 --> 00:54:27,305
I didn't want to be struck blind.

881
00:54:28,613 --> 00:54:30,444
Now I am blind.

882
00:54:30,515 --> 00:54:32,847
Now I have my sight back.

883
00:54:32,917 --> 00:54:35,181
- How was the water?
- Cold without you.

884
00:54:35,253 --> 00:54:37,585
- But good?
- Yes, yes. Good.

885
00:54:44,095 --> 00:54:46,120
How long can we stay?

886
00:54:46,197 --> 00:54:49,166
We'll find out tonight at the casino.

887
00:54:49,233 --> 00:54:51,428
Have we been winning?

888
00:54:51,502 --> 00:54:52,833
Not enough.

889
00:54:52,904 --> 00:54:56,101
Oh, Ravic, I wish I could
have this life always.

890
00:54:56,174 --> 00:54:58,836
- You find that superficial, don't you?
- No.

891
00:54:58,910 --> 00:55:02,846
It is superficial, but we've had
so little of that in our wretched lives.

892
00:55:02,914 --> 00:55:05,348
In a few days, we'll go back to Paris, to...

893
00:55:05,416 --> 00:55:07,213
to that nightclub where nothing ever changes

894
00:55:07,285 --> 00:55:10,277
and to life in a dirty hotel.

895
00:55:10,355 --> 00:55:13,324
It was dark before,
and it will be dark again.

896
00:55:17,195 --> 00:55:18,594
Here comes Tinzy and Nugent.

897
00:55:18,663 --> 00:55:19,994
Oh, they'll go away again.

898
00:55:20,064 --> 00:55:21,998
We promised to go sailing with them.

899
00:55:22,066 --> 00:55:24,034
Oh. Well, then. Go with them.

900
00:55:24,102 --> 00:55:25,569
They're your friends.

901
00:55:25,637 --> 00:55:26,899
Not my friends. They're yours.

902
00:55:26,971 --> 00:55:28,233
You've known them longer.

903
00:55:28,306 --> 00:55:30,137
- Ten minutes longer.
- Well, longer anyway.

904
00:55:30,208 --> 00:55:31,903
- All right.
- Never mind.

905
00:55:31,976 --> 00:55:35,309
Go if you want to.
Tell them I have to work.

906
00:55:35,380 --> 00:55:36,870
You told them that yesterday.

907
00:55:36,948 --> 00:55:40,577
Why is that all women love
these idiotic conversations?

908
00:55:40,652 --> 00:55:43,678
You want to go for a ride?
Well, I have no boat.

909
00:55:43,755 --> 00:55:46,622
Life is short.
We're only here for a few days.

910
00:55:46,691 --> 00:55:50,127
Why should I persuade you
to do what you'll do anyway?

911
00:55:50,194 --> 00:55:51,684
All right, you've persuaded me.

912
00:55:51,763 --> 00:55:54,391
Good. I'll stay on this rock.

913
00:55:54,465 --> 00:55:56,899
I'm beginning to feel like part of it.

914
00:55:56,968 --> 00:55:59,903
You're not a rock.
You're a block of concrete.

915
00:56:02,540 --> 00:56:04,235
Alex!

916
00:56:25,363 --> 00:56:26,728
Monsieur is lucky.

917
00:56:27,799 --> 00:56:30,199
Where's the beautiful lady tonight?

918
00:56:30,268 --> 00:56:31,667
Tonight, the beautiful lady

919
00:56:31,736 --> 00:56:34,102
is behaving like a beautiful lady.

920
00:56:36,207 --> 00:56:37,834
Do you feel lucky?

921
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:38,841
Do you?

922
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,002
Not a chance.

923
00:56:44,849 --> 00:56:46,680
The beautiful lady is here.

924
00:56:59,697 --> 00:57:00,629
23.

925
00:57:08,706 --> 00:57:09,798
5.

926
00:57:09,874 --> 00:57:10,966
8.

927
00:57:27,458 --> 00:57:29,289
Will you please put that
on number 6 for me?

928
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:30,725
- All right.
- Thank you.

929
00:57:32,230 --> 00:57:33,219
5.

930
00:57:40,738 --> 00:57:42,672
Ah, you are idiots.

931
00:57:42,740 --> 00:57:44,298
Choose your side, Joan.

932
00:58:03,928 --> 00:58:05,953
- Were you going to drive off without me?
- No.

933
00:58:06,030 --> 00:58:07,930
You were going to leave me behind
with those idiots.

934
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:08,966
Where are you going?

935
00:58:09,033 --> 00:58:10,466
Nowhere. Just for a drive.

936
00:58:10,535 --> 00:58:12,662
- I'll go with you.
- What about your idiots?

937
00:58:12,737 --> 00:58:15,297
- I told them you were waiting for me.
- Good. Get in.

938
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:18,099
Better put this around you.

939
00:58:31,455 --> 00:58:32,479
Must be the air.

940
00:58:36,294 --> 00:58:39,058
Oh, don't be angry with me, Ravic.

941
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:41,462
This is the first time
I've been on the Riviera.

942
00:58:41,532 --> 00:58:45,059
First time. The first time.

943
00:58:45,136 --> 00:58:47,866
Oh, forget what happened today.
Don't think about it.

944
00:58:47,939 --> 00:58:50,134
You're a wonderful driver, Ravic.
You know that?

945
00:58:50,208 --> 00:58:52,608
Those idiots were saying the same thing.

946
00:58:52,677 --> 00:58:54,167
You're uncanny. You have no past.

947
00:58:54,245 --> 00:58:55,337
Nobody knows anything about you.

948
00:58:55,413 --> 00:58:56,641
I know a hundred times more

949
00:58:56,714 --> 00:58:59,740
about the life of those idiots
than I know about yours.

950
00:59:06,991 --> 00:59:07,980
Too fast?

951
00:59:08,059 --> 00:59:09,583
No. Drive fast.

952
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:11,594
I love you, Ravic.

953
00:59:11,662 --> 00:59:13,755
Let's never go back to Paris.

954
00:59:13,831 --> 00:59:16,857
Let's steal a trunk
full of jewels or rob a bank,

955
00:59:16,934 --> 00:59:19,425
take this car, and never come back.

956
00:59:19,503 --> 00:59:20,936
Careful.

957
00:59:21,005 --> 00:59:23,269
If you want that Calvados,
you'd better let me drive.

958
00:59:25,009 --> 00:59:26,067
That's fine.

959
00:59:32,016 --> 00:59:33,711
Come. We'll get your Calvados here.

960
00:59:36,020 --> 00:59:37,510
Two Calvados.

961
00:59:40,691 --> 00:59:42,249
How much have you had already?

962
00:59:47,198 --> 00:59:49,098
How much have you had to drink?

963
00:59:50,334 --> 00:59:52,302
Too much.

964
00:59:52,370 --> 00:59:54,930
Too much because of you,
because I was away from you.

965
00:59:55,006 --> 00:59:57,474
- Then why didn't you come to me?
- I did come to you.

966
00:59:57,541 --> 00:59:59,202
Yes, when you saw me leave.

967
01:00:01,279 --> 01:00:02,371
Did you win?

968
01:00:03,881 --> 01:00:05,143
Yes.

969
01:00:05,216 --> 01:00:07,150
Then let's go to the most
expensive restaurant

970
01:00:07,218 --> 01:00:08,617
and have caviar and champagne.

971
01:00:10,421 --> 01:00:12,685
Let's be like our parents were
before all these wars...

972
01:00:12,757 --> 01:00:14,748
carefree and sentimental and without fear.

973
01:00:14,825 --> 01:00:17,623
Full of bad taste and tears,

974
01:00:17,695 --> 01:00:20,289
and the moon, oleanders, violins,

975
01:00:20,364 --> 01:00:22,924
and the ocean and love.

976
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:24,627
I want to believe that I'm married to you,

977
01:00:24,702 --> 01:00:27,671
that we have children
and a garden and a house.

978
01:00:27,738 --> 01:00:30,002
I've given up a great career for your sake.

979
01:00:31,242 --> 01:00:33,335
And we still love each other...

980
01:00:33,411 --> 01:00:35,242
after 20 years.

981
01:00:36,347 --> 01:00:38,406
And you still think me beautiful.

982
01:00:39,583 --> 01:00:40,675
And I can't sleep

983
01:00:40,751 --> 01:00:43,049
when you're not at home for one night.

984
01:00:44,755 --> 01:00:46,985
That's all part of it...

985
01:00:47,058 --> 01:00:49,322
part of that bad taste.

986
01:00:53,597 --> 01:00:55,929
There is no use in our planning, Joan.

987
01:00:58,602 --> 01:00:59,534
I know.

988
01:00:59,603 --> 01:01:02,197
No. No, you don't know.

989
01:01:02,273 --> 01:01:03,297
It's not what you think.

990
01:01:03,374 --> 01:01:05,706
It's something I should have told you before.

991
01:01:05,776 --> 01:01:06,868
I can't marry you.

992
01:01:06,944 --> 01:01:08,468
I'm a refugee without a passport,

993
01:01:08,546 --> 01:01:10,036
and I can't get one.

994
01:01:10,114 --> 01:01:12,378
I have no proof of my identity.

995
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:14,350
I live illegally here.

996
01:01:14,418 --> 01:01:16,386
On paper, I don't exist.

997
01:01:16,454 --> 01:01:19,423
If they should catch me,
l... I'd be deported.

998
01:01:19,490 --> 01:01:22,323
Deported? Deported from France?

999
01:01:22,393 --> 01:01:24,520
No, but, Ravic, Ravic, Ra...

1000
01:01:24,595 --> 01:01:26,586
I'd be back. I know the borders.

1001
01:01:26,664 --> 01:01:27,756
It wouldn't be the first time.

1002
01:01:27,832 --> 01:01:28,764
Nor the last.

1003
01:01:28,833 --> 01:01:30,232
Oh, it isn't that bad.

1004
01:01:30,301 --> 01:01:32,394
They haven't caught me in over a year.

1005
01:01:32,470 --> 01:01:35,234
Oh, there is nothing
for us, Ravic, nothing.

1006
01:01:42,646 --> 01:01:45,206
Tears solve nothing.

1007
01:01:45,282 --> 01:01:48,376
Look. Our Calvados is here. Come.

1008
01:01:50,154 --> 01:01:52,884
What if I could close my eyes

1009
01:01:52,957 --> 01:01:54,618
and... open them

1010
01:01:54,692 --> 01:01:57,752
and find all danger gone...

1011
01:01:57,828 --> 01:02:00,592
at last alone in the past?

1012
01:02:00,664 --> 01:02:02,598
All I can give you

1013
01:02:02,666 --> 01:02:05,226
is my love in this bitter present.

1014
01:02:21,685 --> 01:02:23,016
To the present.

1015
01:02:37,668 --> 01:02:39,829
It's a comfort to have you
back in Paris, Ravic.

1016
01:02:39,904 --> 01:02:44,136
It's good to be back and alive
and happy and working.

1017
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:45,300
And well fed.

1018
01:02:45,376 --> 01:02:46,468
Well, so long.

1019
01:02:46,544 --> 01:02:48,034
I'll come by this evening.

1020
01:03:15,339 --> 01:03:17,136
I looked up and saw the cable snap.

1021
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:19,506
He was riding a steel beam
and never had a chance.

1022
01:03:19,577 --> 01:03:22,444
Oh, no, no. Don't lift him.
Leave him where he is.

1023
01:03:22,513 --> 01:03:23,639
What are you, a doctor?

1024
01:03:23,714 --> 01:03:25,079
- Yes.
- All right.

1025
01:03:30,254 --> 01:03:31,414
Unconscious, isn't he?

1026
01:03:32,590 --> 01:03:34,182
Dead.

1027
01:03:34,258 --> 01:03:36,590
But we've just been eating lunch together.

1028
01:03:36,660 --> 01:03:37,786
Somebody call an ambulance.

1029
01:03:37,862 --> 01:03:39,056
The cable hit the woman.
She's bleeding.

1030
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:40,062
- You.
- Where is she?

1031
01:03:40,131 --> 01:03:41,189
Over here, sir.

1032
01:03:48,105 --> 01:03:49,436
Bring her over here.

1033
01:03:52,209 --> 01:03:53,267
Careful.

1034
01:04:05,322 --> 01:04:08,223
Now, don't worry.
You'll be all right.

1035
01:04:08,292 --> 01:04:10,692
Has anyone called for an ambulance?

1036
01:04:10,761 --> 01:04:12,592
Here come the police.
They'll get one.

1037
01:04:12,663 --> 01:04:13,857
Well, I've got to go.

1038
01:04:13,931 --> 01:04:15,125
Back, please.

1039
01:04:16,267 --> 01:04:18,132
The woman is half dead,
and you want to leave?

1040
01:04:18,202 --> 01:04:19,396
Who put this bandage on?

1041
01:04:19,470 --> 01:04:20,960
He did. He says he's a doctor.

1042
01:04:21,038 --> 01:04:22,403
I've tied up the artery.

1043
01:04:22,473 --> 01:04:24,236
Better get her to a hospital fast.

1044
01:04:24,308 --> 01:04:26,299
Phone for the ambulance.

1045
01:04:34,485 --> 01:04:35,816
One moment, Doctor.

1046
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:38,913
May I have your name?

1047
01:04:38,989 --> 01:04:39,921
Police.

1048
01:04:39,990 --> 01:04:41,423
Woyczek.

1049
01:04:41,492 --> 01:04:42,424
You're a German.

1050
01:04:42,493 --> 01:04:43,425
No, a Czech.

1051
01:04:43,494 --> 01:04:44,722
I don't think you're a Czech.

1052
01:04:44,795 --> 01:04:46,592
- Listen, General...
- I think you're a German.

1053
01:04:46,664 --> 01:04:49,030
Have you a license to practice here?

1054
01:04:49,099 --> 01:04:51,932
I don't practice here.
I'm a tourist. A Czech tourist.

1055
01:04:53,003 --> 01:04:54,436
- May I?
- Certainly.

1056
01:04:54,505 --> 01:04:55,494
Hold it.

1057
01:04:56,674 --> 01:04:58,642
- Have you a passport with you?
- Is that necessary?

1058
01:04:58,709 --> 01:05:00,574
- The gentleman's helped a woman.
- I'm interested.

1059
01:05:00,644 --> 01:05:02,635
Have you a passport with you
or your identity card?

1060
01:05:02,713 --> 01:05:04,578
- No, not with me.
- Where is it?

1061
01:05:04,648 --> 01:05:06,843
At the consulate.
It has to be extended.

1062
01:05:06,917 --> 01:05:08,111
Which consulate?

1063
01:05:08,185 --> 01:05:09,948
The Czech Consulate.

1064
01:05:11,689 --> 01:05:13,680
- All right, I'll call them up and ask.
- Of course.

1065
01:05:13,757 --> 01:05:17,818
You won't mind staying here
until this is cleared up, Dr. Woyczek?

1066
01:05:19,196 --> 01:05:20,686
You see that he does.

1067
01:05:23,867 --> 01:05:25,801
- I'm sorry, Doctor.
- Never mind.

1068
01:05:25,869 --> 01:05:26,961
You must understand, sir.

1069
01:05:27,037 --> 01:05:29,904
Fernand's father was hanged
by the Germans in the last war.

1070
01:05:29,974 --> 01:05:31,874
That's why he's crazy on the subject.

1071
01:05:31,942 --> 01:05:34,137
I'm awfully sorry, sir.
If it was up to me...

1072
01:05:34,211 --> 01:05:35,803
I understand.

1073
01:05:35,879 --> 01:05:39,542
Uh, may I use that telephone
before your friend returns?

1074
01:05:41,051 --> 01:05:42,814
Why, certainly.

1075
01:05:50,828 --> 01:05:51,817
Yeah.

1076
01:05:58,902 --> 01:06:00,335
All right.

1077
01:06:00,404 --> 01:06:01,598
All right, Monsieur Woyczek.

1078
01:06:08,545 --> 01:06:10,570
Of course I will remember.

1079
01:06:11,915 --> 01:06:13,542
So long, Woyczek.

1080
01:06:15,586 --> 01:06:18,851
The world should be
executed for murder.

1081
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:30,088
Ravic.

1082
01:06:35,406 --> 01:06:36,395
Ravic?

1083
01:06:38,609 --> 01:06:40,702
Arrested. They have arrested him.

1084
01:06:40,778 --> 01:06:42,143
When? Where? No!

1085
01:06:42,212 --> 01:06:43,201
Joan.

1086
01:06:48,118 --> 01:06:49,210
Where did they take him?

1087
01:06:49,286 --> 01:06:50,981
We can bribe them.
We can get the money.

1088
01:06:51,055 --> 01:06:53,421
- You must not go to him, Joan.
- I must! I must! They will deport him.

1089
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:55,390
He said no one must go to him.

1090
01:06:55,459 --> 01:06:58,792
All the police have now is a man
they have found in the street...

1091
01:06:58,862 --> 01:07:01,558
a face with no papers, no identity.

1092
01:07:01,632 --> 01:07:03,395
But I'll find some way of getting him out.

1093
01:07:03,467 --> 01:07:05,697
They have to believe
whatever that face tells them.

1094
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:08,636
And since there is no proof
that he has been in France before,

1095
01:07:08,706 --> 01:07:11,436
that means deportation
after two weeks in jail.

1096
01:07:11,508 --> 01:07:13,499
But I must... I must see him.
I must go to him.

1097
01:07:13,577 --> 01:07:15,238
There must be some way, somebody.
Where did they take him?

1098
01:07:15,312 --> 01:07:18,247
Joan, if you go to Ravic now,
you will open a door into his past.

1099
01:07:18,315 --> 01:07:20,112
I knew they would catch him! I knew it!

1100
01:07:20,184 --> 01:07:23,415
The minute the authorities find out
that he has been deported before...

1101
01:07:23,487 --> 01:07:26,456
not once, but many times...

1102
01:07:26,523 --> 01:07:29,754
that means six months
in jail before deportation.

1103
01:07:29,827 --> 01:07:31,852
And then they'll catch him again
when he goes back,

1104
01:07:31,929 --> 01:07:34,124
and I won't be able to live for fear of...

1105
01:07:37,835 --> 01:07:42,101
I wish I could say something
comforting, cheerful, pleasant.

1106
01:07:42,172 --> 01:07:45,801
But history has no special
accommodations for lovers.

1107
01:07:48,512 --> 01:07:51,413
I'll do as he asks.
I won't go near him.

1108
01:07:51,482 --> 01:07:54,713
I'll stay here for the two weeks,
and then I'll go wherever he goes.

1109
01:07:54,785 --> 01:07:59,279
It is possible to share
all of the happiness of someone else,

1110
01:07:59,356 --> 01:08:02,792
but only so much of the despair.

1111
01:08:02,860 --> 01:08:05,954
Pity is a pleasure
for comfortable people only.

1112
01:08:06,029 --> 01:08:09,396
It will not last long
in cold border towns,

1113
01:08:09,466 --> 01:08:12,958
filthy cellars, without money,
not enough food.

1114
01:08:13,036 --> 01:08:15,300
Not one place where you can sleep safe.

1115
01:08:15,372 --> 01:08:19,934
And each day the struggle
for mere survival becomes worse.

1116
01:08:20,010 --> 01:08:22,001
- Each day...
- Spare me the rest.

1117
01:08:23,547 --> 01:08:26,983
Tell me he'll be pushed
from prison to prison,

1118
01:08:27,050 --> 01:08:29,848
shoveled back and forth
over the borders like dirt.

1119
01:08:29,920 --> 01:08:33,048
Tell me he'll be shot one day,
running like an animal,

1120
01:08:33,123 --> 01:08:35,091
always running and no place to go to.

1121
01:08:35,159 --> 01:08:36,421
Damn it!

1122
01:08:36,493 --> 01:08:39,257
Go on, tell me that we're talking
about a dead man!

1123
01:08:44,134 --> 01:08:47,399
A refugee without passport

1124
01:08:47,471 --> 01:08:50,668
has lost his membership
in the human race.

1125
01:08:50,741 --> 01:08:54,040
Those who remain alive must go on living.

1126
01:09:00,517 --> 01:09:02,508
I can't live like this.

1127
01:09:02,586 --> 01:09:06,488
I can't go back to one room
and four walls, alone.

1128
01:09:07,758 --> 01:09:10,522
And the darkness of night, and nothing...

1129
01:09:10,594 --> 01:09:12,186
I can't go back to that.

1130
01:09:12,262 --> 01:09:15,356
Alone, without hope.

1131
01:09:15,432 --> 01:09:16,694
Hope.

1132
01:09:16,767 --> 01:09:20,294
Hope is luxury we cannot afford this year.

1133
01:09:21,939 --> 01:09:24,203
Why didn't he call me?

1134
01:09:24,274 --> 01:09:25,536
He should have called me.

1135
01:09:25,609 --> 01:09:27,133
He had only a minute.

1136
01:09:27,211 --> 01:09:28,473
And he called you?

1137
01:09:28,545 --> 01:09:32,948
Minute is too short to say good-bye
to somebody you love.

1138
01:09:35,953 --> 01:09:38,387
What did he say, for me?

1139
01:09:38,455 --> 01:09:40,047
Good-bye.

1140
01:09:40,123 --> 01:09:43,354
He said good-bye.

1141
01:09:43,427 --> 01:09:46,123
Didn't he ask me to wait?

1142
01:09:46,196 --> 01:09:48,630
He said good-bye.

1143
01:10:03,146 --> 01:10:05,137
What are those?

1144
01:10:09,887 --> 01:10:12,754
You and Ravic in Antibes.

1145
01:10:15,659 --> 01:10:17,650
Destroy them.

1146
01:11:03,106 --> 01:11:04,437
Good morning, Miss Madou.

1147
01:11:04,508 --> 01:11:06,169
Morning, Albert.

1148
01:11:14,718 --> 01:11:17,380
Take some hot coffee.
You're soaked.

1149
01:11:24,161 --> 01:11:25,958
It's much too early for the mail.

1150
01:11:26,029 --> 01:11:27,724
Yes, I know.

1151
01:11:27,798 --> 01:11:29,732
I promised I'd let you know at once

1152
01:11:29,800 --> 01:11:31,825
if a letter comes.

1153
01:11:31,902 --> 01:11:33,927
But it never comes, does it?

1154
01:11:34,004 --> 01:11:36,472
You've been doing this for months.

1155
01:11:36,540 --> 01:11:39,839
You ought to go back to work
instead of walking the city all night.

1156
01:11:39,910 --> 01:11:41,707
It's not right.

1157
01:11:41,778 --> 01:11:44,008
Unwise, Albert.

1158
01:11:44,081 --> 01:11:46,015
Very unwise.

1159
01:11:46,083 --> 01:11:48,017
I don't just walk the city,

1160
01:11:48,085 --> 01:11:49,347
not always.

1161
01:11:49,419 --> 01:11:51,387
Sometimes you go to the railroad stations.

1162
01:11:51,455 --> 01:11:52,615
Is that it?

1163
01:11:52,689 --> 01:11:55,715
Yes, the stations.

1164
01:11:55,792 --> 01:11:58,352
Don't men molest you?

1165
01:11:58,428 --> 01:12:01,090
They don't like women who aren't gay.

1166
01:12:01,164 --> 01:12:02,688
Miss Madou,

1167
01:12:02,766 --> 01:12:05,860
why don't you put out your light
when you leave your room?

1168
01:12:05,936 --> 01:12:07,198
It burns all night.

1169
01:12:07,270 --> 01:12:11,070
The bill runs up frightfully,
and your money won't last forever.

1170
01:12:11,141 --> 01:12:13,701
You're right, Albert.

1171
01:12:13,777 --> 01:12:15,142
Thank you for the coffee.

1172
01:12:15,212 --> 01:12:17,203
Oh, Miss Madou?

1173
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,373
A man came to see you.

1174
01:12:19,449 --> 01:12:20,939
A man?

1175
01:12:21,018 --> 01:12:22,383
What man? Who?

1176
01:12:22,452 --> 01:12:24,716
I don't know.
I never saw him before.

1177
01:12:24,788 --> 01:12:27,416
What... What did he say?
What did he want?

1178
01:12:27,491 --> 01:12:29,391
He said he had to see you.

1179
01:12:29,459 --> 01:12:30,721
Where did he go?

1180
01:12:30,794 --> 01:12:33,285
He also said he was a friend of Mr. Ravic's,

1181
01:12:33,363 --> 01:12:36,196
so I had him wait in your room.

1182
01:12:45,108 --> 01:12:48,669
I would have found you sooner, Joan,

1183
01:12:48,745 --> 01:12:50,440
if I had known where to look.

1184
01:12:51,982 --> 01:12:53,609
I'm going back to Antibes.

1185
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:56,082
Will you come?

1186
01:13:32,522 --> 01:13:34,285
Ah, Monsieur Ravic.

1187
01:13:34,357 --> 01:13:36,382
I haven't seen you in some time.

1188
01:13:36,460 --> 01:13:38,758
Woyczek.

1189
01:13:40,764 --> 01:13:42,391
When did you get back?

1190
01:13:42,466 --> 01:13:43,797
This afternoon.

1191
01:13:43,867 --> 01:13:46,131
You stayed away more than three months.

1192
01:13:46,203 --> 01:13:47,465
It's getting harder.

1193
01:13:47,537 --> 01:13:49,437
They watch the borders more closely.

1194
01:13:49,506 --> 01:13:50,939
I was caught five times.

1195
01:13:51,007 --> 01:13:53,134
Why did I not hear from you?

1196
01:13:53,210 --> 01:13:54,802
Letters never help.

1197
01:13:54,878 --> 01:13:56,971
Sit down, sit down.

1198
01:13:57,047 --> 01:13:58,844
- Have dinner.
- No, thank you.

1199
01:13:58,915 --> 01:14:01,645
Drink then. Hey.

1200
01:14:01,718 --> 01:14:03,652
Ah, Monsieur Ravic,
you haven't been here for long time.

1201
01:14:03,720 --> 01:14:04,709
How are you?

1202
01:14:04,788 --> 01:14:05,880
What will it be, Colonel?

1203
01:14:05,956 --> 01:14:06,752
Another bottle, another glass.

1204
01:14:06,823 --> 01:14:07,915
At your service, Colonel.

1205
01:14:07,991 --> 01:14:11,017
Monsieur Ravic.

1206
01:14:11,094 --> 01:14:12,584
I thought your name was Woyczek.

1207
01:14:12,662 --> 01:14:15,222
It was. Sometimes Neumann.

1208
01:14:15,298 --> 01:14:16,765
Occasionally Gunter.

1209
01:14:16,833 --> 01:14:18,630
But I don't want to give up Ravic.

1210
01:14:18,702 --> 01:14:20,101
I like it as a name.

1211
01:14:20,170 --> 01:14:21,535
You are back at the International, eh?

1212
01:14:21,605 --> 01:14:24,403
Yes, yes. Back in my old room.

1213
01:14:26,476 --> 01:14:27,807
Never seen this place so busy.

1214
01:14:27,878 --> 01:14:30,108
Oh! People have gone crazy.

1215
01:14:30,180 --> 01:14:32,978
We could stay open 24 hours a day.

1216
01:14:33,049 --> 01:14:35,813
And mostly German tourists.

1217
01:14:35,886 --> 01:14:37,183
They speak French very well.

1218
01:14:37,254 --> 01:14:40,655
Not at all the way the Germans
spoke it several years ago.

1219
01:14:40,724 --> 01:14:42,191
Spend a lot of money, don't they?

1220
01:14:42,259 --> 01:14:44,853
They treat everybody
who will drink with them.

1221
01:14:44,928 --> 01:14:48,364
Strange, all those German tourists.

1222
01:14:48,431 --> 01:14:51,264
With plenty of money,
and speaking good French.

1223
01:15:23,834 --> 01:15:25,267
Nice voice.

1224
01:15:25,335 --> 01:15:28,862
Ravic, you are talking to your father.

1225
01:15:28,939 --> 01:15:31,032
Connoisseur of the human heart.

1226
01:15:31,107 --> 01:15:33,007
Do not make detours.
Ask me quickly.

1227
01:15:33,076 --> 01:15:34,976
Let's get this behind us.

1228
01:15:35,045 --> 01:15:37,445
- All right, where is she?
- She is not here.

1229
01:15:37,514 --> 01:15:39,914
I have not heard anything
about her for several weeks.

1230
01:15:39,983 --> 01:15:41,450
And before that?

1231
01:15:41,518 --> 01:15:43,611
Before that, she inquired for you,

1232
01:15:43,687 --> 01:15:47,748
for some time, and then not anymore.

1233
01:15:47,824 --> 01:15:49,587
When did she leave her job here?

1234
01:15:49,659 --> 01:15:53,561
Not for some weeks after you left.

1235
01:15:53,630 --> 01:15:56,463
Do you know what she's doing now?

1236
01:15:56,533 --> 01:15:58,933
The last I heard of her,
she was in the south.

1237
01:16:00,103 --> 01:16:03,630
- Heard from whom?
- From the check room girl.

1238
01:16:03,707 --> 01:16:06,437
You want to see her, eh?

1239
01:16:06,509 --> 01:16:08,534
- Yes.
- So.

1240
01:16:08,612 --> 01:16:12,446
If ever I open the door for her,
I will let you know.

1241
01:16:31,401 --> 01:16:33,494
- Well, is she still here?
- Yes.

1242
01:16:33,570 --> 01:16:37,370
Alone? My boy, a reigning queen
could not get in here alone.

1243
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:39,374
Take care of this for me, will you?

1244
01:17:04,501 --> 01:17:05,832
What is it, darling?

1245
01:17:08,638 --> 01:17:09,627
Nothing.

1246
01:17:09,706 --> 01:17:11,196
Let me go. I'll be right back.

1247
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:24,944
Ravic...

1248
01:17:25,021 --> 01:17:26,511
Hello, Joan.

1249
01:17:28,792 --> 01:17:30,225
You're back.

1250
01:17:30,293 --> 01:17:31,726
How long have you been back?

1251
01:17:33,229 --> 01:17:35,060
Two weeks.

1252
01:17:35,131 --> 01:17:36,564
Two weeks, and you didn't even...

1253
01:17:39,536 --> 01:17:41,766
No one knew where to find you.

1254
01:17:41,838 --> 01:17:43,601
Why did you never write?

1255
01:17:43,673 --> 01:17:44,640
I couldn't.

1256
01:17:44,708 --> 01:17:45,675
That's a lie.

1257
01:17:45,742 --> 01:17:48,734
I didn't know whether I could...

1258
01:17:48,812 --> 01:17:50,404
Come with me.

1259
01:17:54,985 --> 01:17:56,452
I didn't know whether
I could come back again.

1260
01:17:56,519 --> 01:17:57,952
You're lying. That's no reason.

1261
01:17:58,021 --> 01:17:59,079
You've been back two weeks,

1262
01:17:59,155 --> 01:18:00,679
and you haven't done
the least thing to find me.

1263
01:18:00,757 --> 01:18:04,056
Joan, you didn't get that tan in Paris.

1264
01:18:04,127 --> 01:18:05,890
Well, I just came back from Antibes.

1265
01:18:07,764 --> 01:18:09,026
So I see.

1266
01:18:10,367 --> 01:18:12,301
Ravic, what are you doing here?

1267
01:18:12,369 --> 01:18:13,427
You must go...

1268
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:17,968
You must go away.
They'll arrest you again.

1269
01:18:18,041 --> 01:18:20,805
I know all about that now.
Next time, it'll be six months in prison.

1270
01:18:20,877 --> 01:18:22,310
That was bad luck.

1271
01:18:22,379 --> 01:18:26,338
As a matter of fact, I hadn't thought
of looking for you in Antibes.

1272
01:18:28,752 --> 01:18:30,913
Whatever you're thinking isn't true.

1273
01:18:30,987 --> 01:18:33,649
Not true at all.

1274
01:18:33,723 --> 01:18:35,623
Go back to your table, Joan.

1275
01:18:35,692 --> 01:18:38,593
Your friends must be getting restless.

1276
01:18:40,397 --> 01:18:41,694
It's your fault.

1277
01:18:41,765 --> 01:18:43,528
Yours. Yours alone.

1278
01:19:06,322 --> 01:19:08,153
All right. Turn on the light.

1279
01:19:10,794 --> 01:19:13,319
Oh, Joan, please.
We're not playing hide-and-seek.

1280
01:19:13,396 --> 01:19:15,364
Did you know I would come?

1281
01:19:15,432 --> 01:19:16,899
- No.
- Your door was open.

1282
01:19:18,001 --> 01:19:19,093
My door is often open.

1283
01:19:19,169 --> 01:19:21,296
I thought you wouldn't be here yet.

1284
01:19:21,371 --> 01:19:23,396
I thought you would be
out drinking somewhere.

1285
01:19:25,875 --> 01:19:27,308
I was playing chess instead.

1286
01:19:27,377 --> 01:19:28,503
What?

1287
01:19:28,578 --> 01:19:30,068
Chess.

1288
01:19:30,146 --> 01:19:31,613
With Morosov, downstairs.

1289
01:19:31,681 --> 01:19:34,479
Chess? But... You can play chess wh...

1290
01:19:34,551 --> 01:19:38,419
It worked. As a matter of fact,
I won a game.

1291
01:19:38,488 --> 01:19:39,955
You are the coldest, most unfeeling...

1292
01:19:40,023 --> 01:19:44,255
See? We've even built up
and etiquette for unhappiness.

1293
01:19:44,327 --> 01:19:45,851
If you'd found me blind drunk,

1294
01:19:45,929 --> 01:19:48,227
everything would have been in good taste.

1295
01:19:48,298 --> 01:19:50,858
The fact that I played chess
and went to sleep

1296
01:19:50,934 --> 01:19:53,334
is proof that I am crude and unfeeling.

1297
01:19:55,105 --> 01:19:57,505
That's good.
I couldn't stand that thing anyway.

1298
01:19:57,574 --> 01:20:00,543
But don't get splinters in your feet.

1299
01:20:05,582 --> 01:20:07,516
Ravic, I'm sorry, but...

1300
01:20:07,584 --> 01:20:09,484
when I saw you tonight,
suddenly I couldn't think at all.

1301
01:20:09,552 --> 01:20:11,110
And when you left,
I thought you'd left for good.

1302
01:20:11,187 --> 01:20:12,017
I couldn't have endured it!

1303
01:20:12,088 --> 01:20:13,487
You can't leave me alone.
You're responsible for me.

1304
01:20:15,492 --> 01:20:17,426
Are you alone?

1305
01:20:19,729 --> 01:20:21,196
You're responsible for me.

1306
01:20:21,264 --> 01:20:22,629
All right. All right.

1307
01:20:22,699 --> 01:20:26,260
I'm responsible for the occupation
of Czechoslovakia, too.

1308
01:20:26,336 --> 01:20:29,601
Now, stop it. It's getting light,
it's time for you to go.

1309
01:20:31,574 --> 01:20:33,599
You don't love me anymore.

1310
01:20:33,676 --> 01:20:36,804
Oh, what idiots have you been with
the last three months?

1311
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,347
What else could I have done?

1312
01:20:38,414 --> 01:20:40,245
Sit at the door to your hotel
and stare at the walls...

1313
01:20:40,316 --> 01:20:42,784
No, no, no, no.
No confessions, please.

1314
01:20:42,852 --> 01:20:45,082
I don't want any confessions.

1315
01:20:46,422 --> 01:20:48,913
What I want to know is why you're here.

1316
01:20:51,694 --> 01:20:54,720
I'm here. Isn't that enough?

1317
01:20:57,567 --> 01:20:59,432
Yes. Yes, you're right.

1318
01:20:59,502 --> 01:21:00,560
It's enough.

1319
01:21:04,140 --> 01:21:06,665
You say that, but first you have
to take away all the joy.

1320
01:21:11,481 --> 01:21:13,813
What are you going to do?
Throw me out?

1321
01:21:29,966 --> 01:21:32,093
We should have done this
long before now.

1322
01:21:32,168 --> 01:21:34,102
Yes.

1323
01:21:36,739 --> 01:21:38,798
Why don't you ask me, Ravic?

1324
01:21:41,444 --> 01:21:43,969
About what happened in between.

1325
01:21:48,585 --> 01:21:51,452
Don't you want to know
where I live, how I live?

1326
01:21:51,521 --> 01:21:54,012
Joan, look outside.

1327
01:21:54,090 --> 01:21:56,820
Ask the air whether it rained yesterday.

1328
01:21:56,893 --> 01:22:00,294
Whether there was a war
in China or Spain.

1329
01:22:00,363 --> 01:22:04,299
Whether thousands are dying
or being born at this moment.

1330
01:22:04,367 --> 01:22:06,961
The world exists. We exist.

1331
01:22:07,036 --> 01:22:09,698
Why rake up dead leaves?

1332
01:22:16,746 --> 01:22:18,646
Did you miss me?

1333
01:22:18,715 --> 01:22:22,651
- Yes.
- Much?

1334
01:22:22,719 --> 01:22:24,619
Yes.

1335
01:22:24,687 --> 01:22:27,679
I haven't heard that for a long time.

1336
01:22:27,757 --> 01:22:30,055
I'll drop you off at the hospital.

1337
01:22:39,502 --> 01:22:41,766
Flowers?

1338
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:45,302
- Why are they closed?
- They're having a party.

1339
01:22:45,375 --> 01:22:47,002
It's the captain's birthday.

1340
01:22:47,076 --> 01:22:48,373
No customers allowed.

1341
01:22:48,444 --> 01:22:50,002
Thank you.

1342
01:23:32,989 --> 01:23:35,048
Not so fast, my friends.

1343
01:23:35,124 --> 01:23:37,922
Give me a slower song, more romantic.

1344
01:23:37,994 --> 01:23:39,552
I've a long journey ahead.

1345
01:24:02,485 --> 01:24:05,386
Have you heard from her?

1346
01:24:05,455 --> 01:24:07,787
No. Not for three days.

1347
01:24:11,394 --> 01:24:14,591
Hey! Sad songs are for customers!

1348
01:24:14,664 --> 01:24:17,758
Let us have some gaiety, eh?

1349
01:24:29,746 --> 01:24:33,079
I think we have had enough
of this party, don't you?

1350
01:24:33,149 --> 01:24:34,446
Want to take walk?

1351
01:24:34,517 --> 01:24:37,111
No. Don't be so sentimental.

1352
01:24:37,186 --> 01:24:39,313
Might as well get used to it.

1353
01:24:55,638 --> 01:24:57,697
Ravic, come in.

1354
01:24:59,275 --> 01:25:01,209
It's good to have you here.

1355
01:25:05,114 --> 01:25:06,741
I've been waiting for you.

1356
01:25:06,816 --> 01:25:09,910
You didn't call me for days,
so I had to call you.

1357
01:25:09,986 --> 01:25:11,886
Come.

1358
01:25:11,954 --> 01:25:14,286
How do you like it?

1359
01:25:14,357 --> 01:25:16,882
It's nice.

1360
01:25:16,959 --> 01:25:19,154
Large and nice.

1361
01:25:20,296 --> 01:25:21,524
Do you know how it works?

1362
01:25:21,597 --> 01:25:23,087
- No.
- Oh, it's wonderful.

1363
01:25:23,166 --> 01:25:24,895
It plays for hours,
and I can lie here and listen

1364
01:25:24,967 --> 01:25:26,832
and watch it getting
dark outside and dream.

1365
01:25:26,903 --> 01:25:27,961
Do you like it?

1366
01:25:28,037 --> 01:25:30,062
Come, you haven't seen the rest yet.

1367
01:25:30,139 --> 01:25:32,300
One feels quite different
in an apartment.

1368
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:35,674
Different than in those
dreary hotel rooms.

1369
01:25:35,745 --> 01:25:38,680
Yes, you're right.

1370
01:25:38,748 --> 01:25:43,617
Well, that's nice to have
had a look at all this.

1371
01:25:46,956 --> 01:25:49,049
Ravic, you're not going?

1372
01:25:50,460 --> 01:25:53,122
Yes, Joan. For good.

1373
01:25:55,431 --> 01:25:56,728
What are you saying? Why?

1374
01:25:56,799 --> 01:26:00,428
This whole place should tell you why.

1375
01:26:02,638 --> 01:26:04,629
Who's been talking to you,
telling you things? Morozov?

1376
01:26:04,707 --> 01:26:06,436
No one had to tell me anything.

1377
01:26:06,509 --> 01:26:09,706
I know, because I have this apartment,

1378
01:26:09,779 --> 01:26:11,474
because I don't work
at the Sheherazade any longer,

1379
01:26:11,547 --> 01:26:13,777
Morosov starts imagining things,
and you fall right in with him.

1380
01:26:13,850 --> 01:26:15,147
- Stop it.
- That a person can be somebody,

1381
01:26:15,218 --> 01:26:17,152
and make something out
of herself, that's a bit...

1382
01:26:17,220 --> 01:26:19,051
Now stop your nonsense.

1383
01:26:22,892 --> 01:26:24,826
Are you going to beat me, too?

1384
01:26:24,894 --> 01:26:28,193
I just wanted to stop that babbling.

1385
01:26:28,264 --> 01:26:31,290
Do you think I'm calm just because
I came in here calmly?

1386
01:26:31,367 --> 01:26:34,268
What do you think I've been doing
for the past three days?

1387
01:26:34,337 --> 01:26:35,804
I've been waiting for you.

1388
01:26:35,872 --> 01:26:38,932
I didn't have your telephone number.
I didn't think I had to know it.

1389
01:26:39,008 --> 01:26:41,101
I didn't have your address.

1390
01:26:41,177 --> 01:26:43,805
I didn't think I had to know that, either.

1391
01:26:43,880 --> 01:26:45,905
For three and a half months
I didn't see you.

1392
01:26:45,982 --> 01:26:49,679
Well, I don't think
I missed you as much then

1393
01:26:49,752 --> 01:26:52,778
as when you kept away
from me for one day.

1394
01:26:52,855 --> 01:26:55,085
My thoughts were constantly on you

1395
01:26:55,157 --> 01:26:57,421
in my room at the hospital,
everywhere.

1396
01:26:57,493 --> 01:27:00,360
I sat with Morozov
and pictured you walking in.

1397
01:27:00,429 --> 01:27:01,487
But you didn't come.

1398
01:27:01,564 --> 01:27:04,624
I stared at the phone until I could have
smashed it on the floor.

1399
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:06,497
But you didn't call.

1400
01:27:06,569 --> 01:27:08,503
Then everything became clear to me.

1401
01:27:08,571 --> 01:27:10,801
I knew you wouldn't come,
only I hadn't wanted to believe it.

1402
01:27:10,873 --> 01:27:13,171
You had made sure of me,

1403
01:27:13,242 --> 01:27:15,642
then you could afford
to take your time.

1404
01:27:17,179 --> 01:27:20,342
There was someone else.

1405
01:27:20,416 --> 01:27:23,977
Not only someone else,
but another life, as well.

1406
01:27:25,187 --> 01:27:29,487
This life, that you want me to share.

1407
01:27:33,563 --> 01:27:36,031
So, you'll break it off and go.

1408
01:27:36,098 --> 01:27:37,656
As simple as that.

1409
01:27:37,733 --> 01:27:40,167
You didn't want to know anything,
and I loved you for it.

1410
01:27:40,236 --> 01:27:41,726
And now... now you come
and reproach me.

1411
01:27:41,804 --> 01:27:44,329
What do you want of me, anyway?
What rights have you?

1412
01:27:44,407 --> 01:27:47,001
None. I thought you had come back.

1413
01:27:49,645 --> 01:27:52,170
Well, didn't I?

1414
01:27:52,248 --> 01:27:56,275
You came to me,
but you did not come back.

1415
01:27:56,352 --> 01:27:57,979
Ravic, listen to me.

1416
01:28:03,626 --> 01:28:06,686
While you were in Switzerland, I waited.

1417
01:28:06,762 --> 01:28:08,957
I waited, and there was nothing.

1418
01:28:12,168 --> 01:28:15,569
Then, one day, someone came...

1419
01:28:15,638 --> 01:28:18,129
who wanted me.

1420
01:28:18,207 --> 01:28:19,970
Nothing but me.

1421
01:28:20,042 --> 01:28:22,772
Wholly and forever.

1422
01:28:22,845 --> 01:28:24,870
It was like a landslide,

1423
01:28:24,947 --> 01:28:27,677
which one laughs at in the beginning.

1424
01:28:27,750 --> 01:28:29,718
Then, suddenly,

1425
01:28:29,785 --> 01:28:32,754
there's nothing left to hold onto...

1426
01:28:32,822 --> 01:28:36,485
when one can't resist any longer.

1427
01:28:36,559 --> 01:28:38,220
Don't you understand?

1428
01:28:38,294 --> 01:28:39,761
Oh, yes.

1429
01:28:41,397 --> 01:28:43,160
I knew.

1430
01:28:43,232 --> 01:28:44,665
I knew it.

1431
01:28:44,734 --> 01:28:46,929
It's quite easy to understand.

1432
01:28:48,871 --> 01:28:50,964
Beside you, he's nothing.

1433
01:28:52,208 --> 01:28:54,142
I knew that the minute I saw you.

1434
01:28:56,112 --> 01:28:58,672
I know I must break with him, but...

1435
01:28:58,748 --> 01:29:01,376
I need time.

1436
01:29:01,450 --> 01:29:03,418
L... I can't do it right away.

1437
01:29:03,486 --> 01:29:06,353
You see how generous he has been.

1438
01:29:06,422 --> 01:29:09,084
I didn't know if you
would ever come back.

1439
01:29:12,895 --> 01:29:15,659
We were to be married.

1440
01:29:15,731 --> 01:29:17,528
Oh, Ravic, help me.

1441
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,033
How can I help you?

1442
01:29:19,101 --> 01:29:20,329
By leaving you alone?

1443
01:29:20,403 --> 01:29:22,598
No, I mustn't lose you!
I can't lose you!

1444
01:29:22,672 --> 01:29:24,469
Then what do you want me to do?

1445
01:29:30,946 --> 01:29:33,312
Give me time.

1446
01:29:33,382 --> 01:29:35,646
Wait for me.

1447
01:29:35,718 --> 01:29:36,878
Wait for you?

1448
01:29:36,952 --> 01:29:38,681
Yes, wait for me.

1449
01:29:38,754 --> 01:29:41,382
I'm a refugee.

1450
01:29:41,457 --> 01:29:43,584
It's my profession to wait,

1451
01:29:43,659 --> 01:29:46,150
to keep alive and wait.

1452
01:29:51,934 --> 01:29:53,561
You'll come again, Ravic?

1453
01:29:53,636 --> 01:29:55,297
Don't think about it.

1454
01:29:55,371 --> 01:29:57,066
Take your time.

1455
01:29:57,139 --> 01:29:59,130
You'll find out for yourself.

1456
01:31:26,295 --> 01:31:27,284
Good evening, sir.

1457
01:31:27,363 --> 01:31:30,764
Bring me hors d'oeuvres
and a bottle of your driest wine.

1458
01:31:30,833 --> 01:31:33,165
- Yes, sir.
- Leave the menu.

1459
01:31:34,670 --> 01:31:36,160
Good evening, sir.

1460
01:31:36,238 --> 01:31:38,069
<i>Ja. Telephone this number.</i>

1461
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:40,335
Ask for a Mr. Himmelstrutz.

1462
01:31:40,409 --> 01:31:42,274
- Give him this message.
- Yes, sir.

1463
01:31:42,344 --> 01:31:45,507
<i>And bring me a package
of Oziri zigarette.</i>

1464
01:31:45,581 --> 01:31:47,344
Gold tip.

1465
01:31:58,594 --> 01:32:00,687
Mr. Himmelstrutz, please.

1466
01:32:02,598 --> 01:32:04,190
Mr. Himmelstrutz?

1467
01:32:04,266 --> 01:32:06,097
This is the chasseur at Fouquet's.

1468
01:32:06,168 --> 01:32:08,068
I have a message for you
from Mr. Haake.

1469
01:32:08,137 --> 01:32:10,037
Sorry. We have no Chesterfields.

1470
01:32:10,105 --> 01:32:12,266
Um, Laurents, Green.

1471
01:32:14,944 --> 01:32:18,812
A package of Oziri cigarette.
Gold tip.

1472
01:33:15,304 --> 01:33:16,236
Brandy, please.

1473
01:33:16,305 --> 01:33:17,465
Yes, sir.

1474
01:33:24,013 --> 01:33:25,241
Ravic.

1475
01:33:27,082 --> 01:33:28,913
Don't you recognize me anymore?

1476
01:33:28,984 --> 01:33:30,781
How do you happen to be here?

1477
01:33:32,321 --> 01:33:34,186
Aren't you going to ask me to sit down?

1478
01:33:34,256 --> 01:33:35,416
No. I'm waiting for someone.

1479
01:33:35,491 --> 01:33:36,981
You must leave me alone.

1480
01:33:38,694 --> 01:33:40,924
Not until I've seen what she looks like.

1481
01:33:42,431 --> 01:33:44,092
Who?

1482
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:46,293
The woman you're waiting for.

1483
01:33:49,171 --> 01:33:50,661
Don't do that.

1484
01:33:53,208 --> 01:33:54,232
Now I will wait.

1485
01:33:54,310 --> 01:33:56,278
Then sit somewhere else, please.

1486
01:34:00,082 --> 01:34:01,947
But why are you doing this, Ravic?

1487
01:34:02,017 --> 01:34:03,644
You promised to wait for me.

1488
01:34:03,719 --> 01:34:06,779
You yourself said it would take time,
and it has only been two weeks.

1489
01:34:06,855 --> 01:34:08,823
Only two weeks.

1490
01:34:08,891 --> 01:34:10,290
Well, I didn't come here by accident.

1491
01:34:10,359 --> 01:34:12,224
I was looking for you.
Ravic, I must see you alone.

1492
01:34:12,294 --> 01:34:13,488
- No.
- It's important.

1493
01:34:13,562 --> 01:34:15,962
- I must talk to you.
- Don't be a child.

1494
01:34:20,169 --> 01:34:21,431
I'm going to leave him.

1495
01:34:21,503 --> 01:34:23,061
Yes, yes. You told me.

1496
01:34:23,138 --> 01:34:25,163
But I'm afraid.
He threatens me.

1497
01:34:25,240 --> 01:34:26,571
Hmm? What was that?

1498
01:34:26,642 --> 01:34:29,338
- He threatens me.
- Who?

1499
01:34:29,411 --> 01:34:31,709
Oh. Oh, I see.

1500
01:34:31,780 --> 01:34:33,680
I'm in danger.
He can be vicious, Ravic.

1501
01:34:33,749 --> 01:34:35,376
Oh, you're not even listening to...

1502
01:34:37,186 --> 01:34:38,744
Wait. Just a moment.

1503
01:34:38,821 --> 01:34:39,753
- No.
- One second.

1504
01:34:39,822 --> 01:34:40,880
No.

1505
01:34:43,826 --> 01:34:44,815
Sorry I'm late.

1506
01:34:44,893 --> 01:34:46,861
Doesn't matter.
I'm going home.

1507
01:34:46,929 --> 01:34:47,918
It was unavoidable.

1508
01:35:11,620 --> 01:35:13,212
Permit me, please.

1509
01:35:13,288 --> 01:35:16,314
Permit me, please.
There is no other table.

1510
01:35:16,392 --> 01:35:18,121
Sit down, please.

1511
01:35:33,876 --> 01:35:34,900
Good morning!

1512
01:35:48,657 --> 01:35:50,215
I saw you while I was still inside.

1513
01:35:50,292 --> 01:35:51,987
I spotted you at once.

1514
01:35:53,829 --> 01:35:55,592
Oh, the scar.

1515
01:35:55,664 --> 01:35:57,495
It is a mark from a German student course.

1516
01:35:57,566 --> 01:36:01,263
So you are German
or so you have studied in Germany.

1517
01:36:04,173 --> 01:36:05,435
Correct?

1518
01:36:05,507 --> 01:36:06,769
Correct.

1519
01:36:06,842 --> 01:36:10,005
It is my business
to know these things.

1520
01:36:10,079 --> 01:36:11,546
- Cognac.
- Yes, sir.

1521
01:36:11,613 --> 01:36:14,605
That is one good thing
they have here, is cognac.

1522
01:36:14,683 --> 01:36:16,241
Otherwise, all is decadent.

1523
01:36:16,318 --> 01:36:21,950
These people here only wish for lazy life.

1524
01:36:22,024 --> 01:36:23,389
Do you live here?

1525
01:36:23,459 --> 01:36:25,620
Yes.

1526
01:36:25,694 --> 01:36:26,956
Long time?

1527
01:36:27,029 --> 01:36:28,087
Quite a while.

1528
01:36:30,866 --> 01:36:33,130
Permit me.

1529
01:36:33,202 --> 01:36:34,794
Ivon Haake.

1530
01:36:34,870 --> 01:36:35,802
Holn.

1531
01:36:35,871 --> 01:36:37,805
- Von Holn?
- Yes.

1532
01:36:42,077 --> 01:36:46,104
You must know Paris well.

1533
01:36:46,181 --> 01:36:48,046
Fairly well.

1534
01:36:48,117 --> 01:36:52,053
I do not mean the museums.

1535
01:36:52,121 --> 01:36:53,850
I know what you mean.

1536
01:36:55,390 --> 01:36:57,381
- May I offer you a drink?
- No, thank you.

1537
01:36:57,459 --> 01:36:58,585
I'll stick to this one.

1538
01:36:58,660 --> 01:36:59,922
So.

1539
01:37:08,403 --> 01:37:10,371
Chic.

1540
01:37:10,439 --> 01:37:13,340
These people here know all about that.

1541
01:37:13,408 --> 01:37:15,876
But these are nothing
compared to this woman

1542
01:37:15,944 --> 01:37:17,206
you were talking to now.

1543
01:37:17,279 --> 01:37:18,803
You saw her?

1544
01:37:21,083 --> 01:37:22,846
Good acquaintance?

1545
01:37:22,918 --> 01:37:24,283
Yes.

1546
01:37:24,353 --> 01:37:25,513
Just that.

1547
01:37:25,587 --> 01:37:28,556
It is difficult here
to meet a woman like her.

1548
01:37:29,558 --> 01:37:30,547
It can be arranged.

1549
01:37:31,693 --> 01:37:33,786
So.

1550
01:37:33,862 --> 01:37:35,352
This woman is French?

1551
01:37:35,430 --> 01:37:37,022
Italian.

1552
01:37:37,099 --> 01:37:40,364
With a few other races mixed in.

1553
01:37:40,435 --> 01:37:43,063
Not bad.

1554
01:37:43,138 --> 01:37:45,663
Naturally, at home, we cannot have that.

1555
01:37:45,741 --> 01:37:46,673
But here...

1556
01:37:46,742 --> 01:37:49,267
Here you are a tourist.

1557
01:37:56,952 --> 01:37:58,544
You understand!

1558
01:37:59,788 --> 01:38:01,415
Thank you, Herr Haake.

1559
01:38:04,059 --> 01:38:06,220
Do you have, uh...

1560
01:38:06,295 --> 01:38:09,492
<i>much contact mit refugees?</i>

1561
01:38:11,466 --> 01:38:12,899
Some.

1562
01:38:12,968 --> 01:38:16,836
We appreciate you know
certain informations?

1563
01:38:16,905 --> 01:38:18,532
We even pay for this.

1564
01:38:18,607 --> 01:38:20,973
Herr Ivon Haake,
you're not suggesting that...

1565
01:38:21,043 --> 01:38:23,341
Naturally, between men like you and me,

1566
01:38:23,412 --> 01:38:26,006
that is out of the question
unless it is a matter of honor.

1567
01:38:34,256 --> 01:38:36,190
- Waiter.
- Yes, sir?

1568
01:38:36,258 --> 01:38:38,192
No, no, no, no, no.
Allow me.

1569
01:38:38,260 --> 01:38:39,818
In Paris, you're my guest.

1570
01:38:39,895 --> 01:38:41,590
Ten francs.

1571
01:38:41,663 --> 01:38:42,994
- You must go?
- Thank you.

1572
01:38:43,065 --> 01:38:45,363
Well...

1573
01:38:45,434 --> 01:38:49,268
I thought I would
stroll about a bit tonight.

1574
01:38:49,338 --> 01:38:50,771
So?

1575
01:38:50,839 --> 01:38:52,101
You know.

1576
01:38:52,174 --> 01:38:56,201
There are things here for tourists
to see and learn.

1577
01:38:56,278 --> 01:38:58,872
Tonight. Oh, what a pity.

1578
01:38:58,947 --> 01:39:01,040
I must go to Berlin tonight.

1579
01:39:01,116 --> 01:39:03,016
I was just waiting here for two friends.

1580
01:39:03,085 --> 01:39:04,746
Our baggage is already at the station.

1581
01:39:04,820 --> 01:39:07,687
But maybe next time, huh?
I'll be back here in a few days.

1582
01:39:07,756 --> 01:39:09,883
I could call you up then.
Where do you live?

1583
01:39:09,958 --> 01:39:13,860
Uh, at the Prince de Galles,
just across the street.

1584
01:39:13,929 --> 01:39:15,692
Prince de Galles.

1585
01:39:23,872 --> 01:39:25,635
Are these your friends?

1586
01:39:27,876 --> 01:39:29,468
Just on time.

1587
01:39:29,544 --> 01:39:31,478
<i>Auf Wiedersehen,
Herr von Holn.</i>

1588
01:39:31,546 --> 01:39:34,310
I am delighted to have met you,
and you will hear from me

1589
01:39:34,383 --> 01:39:36,180
sometime between
the 28th and the 5th,

1590
01:39:36,251 --> 01:39:38,310
and discretion, of course.

1591
01:39:38,387 --> 01:39:39,319
Of course.

1592
01:39:39,388 --> 01:39:40,878
Between the 28th and the 5th.

1593
01:39:40,956 --> 01:39:41,980
Don't forget.

1594
01:39:42,057 --> 01:39:43,149
I never forget anything.

1595
01:39:43,225 --> 01:39:46,524
Neither an appointment or a face.

1596
01:39:46,595 --> 01:39:48,153
It's my profession.

1597
01:40:28,770 --> 01:40:30,203
Ravic.

1598
01:40:30,272 --> 01:40:31,864
Come right away.

1599
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:33,703
Yes. No. Come right away, please.

1600
01:40:33,775 --> 01:40:35,106
L... I'm frightened.

1601
01:40:35,177 --> 01:40:38,044
Help me, Ravic.
Please come.

1602
01:40:38,113 --> 01:40:39,307
Yes.

1603
01:40:50,225 --> 01:40:51,214
Joan.

1604
01:40:55,731 --> 01:40:57,062
Joan.

1605
01:41:01,103 --> 01:41:02,263
Oh, you're here.

1606
01:41:02,337 --> 01:41:03,361
What happened?

1607
01:41:03,438 --> 01:41:04,837
Nothing.

1608
01:41:04,906 --> 01:41:06,999
I'm glad you still have
enough concern for me

1609
01:41:07,075 --> 01:41:08,565
to come when I call you.

1610
01:41:15,584 --> 01:41:17,381
So you lied to get me up here.

1611
01:41:17,452 --> 01:41:19,977
Yes. I had to see you.

1612
01:41:21,156 --> 01:41:24,557
And if I have to lie to see you,
I'll continue to lie.

1613
01:41:26,395 --> 01:41:28,488
You acted very strangely at Fouquet's.

1614
01:41:28,563 --> 01:41:31,191
It was like telling me that everything
was over between us.

1615
01:41:31,266 --> 01:41:32,858
It is.

1616
01:41:38,407 --> 01:41:39,533
You needn't do that.

1617
01:41:39,608 --> 01:41:41,735
I'm not going, not this time.

1618
01:41:41,810 --> 01:41:45,177
Not until I make you understand
that the book is closed.

1619
01:41:45,247 --> 01:41:46,509
It is not closed.

1620
01:41:46,581 --> 01:41:48,845
I can't bring myself to marry Alex.

1621
01:41:48,917 --> 01:41:50,407
I love you.

1622
01:41:52,421 --> 01:41:55,288
And I'll always love you.

1623
01:41:55,357 --> 01:41:57,120
And you love me.

1624
01:41:57,192 --> 01:41:58,955
Yes.

1625
01:41:59,027 --> 01:42:01,120
But I have broken away from you.

1626
01:42:03,365 --> 01:42:06,630
Are we automatons
that we can turn love on and off?

1627
01:42:06,701 --> 01:42:09,602
We were finished when I returned
from Switzerland.

1628
01:42:09,671 --> 01:42:11,639
I knew it then.
I should have broken off then.

1629
01:42:11,706 --> 01:42:15,665
I should have broken off
the first time you brought me here,

1630
01:42:15,744 --> 01:42:17,735
but I wasn't sure.

1631
01:42:17,813 --> 01:42:19,280
No one can prophesy.

1632
01:42:20,615 --> 01:42:23,083
And sometimes one doesn't
want to know everything.

1633
01:42:44,072 --> 01:42:46,836
I can't imagine our never being together.

1634
01:42:49,744 --> 01:42:52,941
For a time, yes, but not forever.

1635
01:42:53,014 --> 01:42:55,209
You know you will leave me again...

1636
01:42:55,283 --> 01:42:58,446
tomorrow, the day after tomorrow,
sometime.

1637
01:43:03,825 --> 01:43:05,190
Yes.

1638
01:43:05,260 --> 01:43:06,955
And if you returned,

1639
01:43:07,028 --> 01:43:09,326
you know you would always go again.

1640
01:43:11,266 --> 01:43:12,665
Yes.

1641
01:43:14,369 --> 01:43:16,564
Yes, yes, yes!

1642
01:43:18,106 --> 01:43:20,097
Oh, what's the use?

1643
01:43:21,510 --> 01:43:24,946
What is it?
Why is it that way with us?

1644
01:43:25,013 --> 01:43:26,947
It's not only us.

1645
01:43:27,015 --> 01:43:30,678
Everyone searches for security in love.

1646
01:43:30,752 --> 01:43:33,949
You found them both,
but in two different men.

1647
01:43:34,022 --> 01:43:36,388
You want the one, and you don't
want to let the other go.

1648
01:43:36,458 --> 01:43:38,688
Yes, I would, Ravic.
I want only...

1649
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:41,228
only I'm afraid.

1650
01:43:41,296 --> 01:43:44,129
I'd afraid of letting my love for you
do to me what it did...

1651
01:43:44,199 --> 01:43:46,497
what it did before,

1652
01:43:46,568 --> 01:43:49,264
when you were taken away from me,

1653
01:43:49,337 --> 01:43:51,168
when you were deported.

1654
01:43:53,308 --> 01:43:56,368
I can't, I can't be hurt like that again.

1655
01:44:03,251 --> 01:44:04,684
Can't we...

1656
01:44:04,753 --> 01:44:06,812
Can't we at least...

1657
01:44:06,888 --> 01:44:10,153
A former-Iover friendship? No.

1658
01:44:10,225 --> 01:44:13,592
Might be possible with some people.

1659
01:44:13,662 --> 01:44:16,756
A love like ours has no substitute.

1660
01:44:16,831 --> 01:44:19,800
Pain is part of it.

1661
01:44:19,868 --> 01:44:21,802
I can't.

1662
01:44:21,870 --> 01:44:23,337
I can't.

1663
01:44:23,405 --> 01:44:24,337
I can't.

1664
01:44:24,406 --> 01:44:25,634
I know.

1665
01:44:30,145 --> 01:44:32,113
That's why this is the end.

1666
01:44:43,558 --> 01:44:45,856
Ravic!

1667
01:45:03,311 --> 01:45:04,608
Hello.

1668
01:45:06,681 --> 01:45:07,909
Yes.

1669
01:45:07,983 --> 01:45:09,541
Yes, thank you.

1670
01:45:09,618 --> 01:45:11,347
I'm expecting him.

1671
01:45:29,771 --> 01:45:33,070
You certainly did not rent
one of the cheap suites.

1672
01:45:33,141 --> 01:45:36,838
Have you ever sat in a plush hole
the entire day and waited?

1673
01:45:36,911 --> 01:45:38,936
Longer, my boy, longer.

1674
01:45:39,014 --> 01:45:41,346
And remember, this is the first day only.

1675
01:45:41,416 --> 01:45:42,576
You may wait seven.

1676
01:45:42,651 --> 01:45:44,551
You may wait 7,000. Look.

1677
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:48,889
France closed the German frontier today.

1678
01:45:51,393 --> 01:45:53,088
There's still a chance.

1679
01:45:53,161 --> 01:45:54,788
I'll wait the week out.

1680
01:45:54,863 --> 01:45:58,526
Did you have much trouble
getting in here without passport?

1681
01:45:58,600 --> 01:46:02,036
No. Night porters don't ask questions
in exclusive hotels.

1682
01:46:02,103 --> 01:46:03,695
What about the day fellows?

1683
01:46:03,772 --> 01:46:06,172
That's a chance I'll have to take.

1684
01:46:06,241 --> 01:46:08,937
If I had only thought
of asking Haake's Paris hotel.

1685
01:46:09,010 --> 01:46:10,807
I know. I know.

1686
01:46:10,879 --> 01:46:14,747
You are sitting here thinking
you have done everything wrong, eh?

1687
01:46:14,816 --> 01:46:16,306
- Forget it.
- Did you rent the car?

1688
01:46:16,384 --> 01:46:19,182
Oh, yes. Yes, Talbot with leather seats.

1689
01:46:19,254 --> 01:46:21,381
It's parked in the Rue de Berri,
opposite the Lancaster.

1690
01:46:21,456 --> 01:46:23,754
- Thank you.
- Remember, you have no license to drive.

1691
01:46:23,825 --> 01:46:26,089
That has never bothered me before.

1692
01:46:26,161 --> 01:46:31,155
I came here straight
from the International.

1693
01:46:31,232 --> 01:46:34,531
I left Joan in my room, crying.

1694
01:46:37,172 --> 01:46:38,400
Hello.

1695
01:46:38,473 --> 01:46:39,701
One moment, please.

1696
01:46:39,774 --> 01:46:41,605
Do you know where
you'll want to take him?

1697
01:46:41,676 --> 01:46:43,109
Yes, I know a place.

1698
01:46:43,178 --> 01:46:44,509
Yes?

1699
01:46:44,579 --> 01:46:46,774
Yes, this is Herr von Holn.

1700
01:46:46,848 --> 01:46:50,011
The wine you ordered,
was it Liebfrauen '29?

1701
01:46:51,419 --> 01:46:53,478
Yes. Open.

1702
01:46:53,555 --> 01:46:55,420
Room service.

1703
01:46:55,490 --> 01:46:57,082
Yeah.

1704
01:46:58,493 --> 01:47:01,656
I hope you do not attract attention.

1705
01:47:01,730 --> 01:47:04,893
No man in Paris eats in his room
unless he is sick.

1706
01:47:07,635 --> 01:47:09,227
I wish I could come with you.

1707
01:47:09,304 --> 01:47:11,932
I'm glad you don't have to.

1708
01:47:12,006 --> 01:47:13,974
God bless your eyes.

1709
01:47:54,582 --> 01:47:56,174
They've invaded Poland.

1710
01:48:01,556 --> 01:48:03,046
Yes, it's started.

1711
01:48:03,124 --> 01:48:05,786
The whole city is deathly quiet.

1712
01:48:05,860 --> 01:48:10,092
Whole country is hoping against hope.

1713
01:48:10,165 --> 01:48:13,726
And here I am playing
this silly game of Indians.

1714
01:48:15,870 --> 01:48:19,203
If only Haake hasn't left Paris by now.

1715
01:48:19,274 --> 01:48:20,935
With the frontiers closed,

1716
01:48:21,009 --> 01:48:23,102
he may not even have come at all.

1717
01:48:23,178 --> 01:48:25,112
For four days now, I've...

1718
01:48:25,180 --> 01:48:28,946
Let's talk about something else.

1719
01:48:29,017 --> 01:48:30,041
Yes.

1720
01:48:30,118 --> 01:48:34,214
What do you really intend
to do about Joan?

1721
01:48:35,423 --> 01:48:36,617
Have you seen her again?

1722
01:48:36,691 --> 01:48:39,319
Every day she comes
to see me at International,

1723
01:48:39,394 --> 01:48:41,828
every night at Sheherazade.

1724
01:48:41,896 --> 01:48:44,558
She wants to make things right.

1725
01:48:44,632 --> 01:48:46,930
She is desperate.

1726
01:48:47,001 --> 01:48:48,866
Let's talk about something else.

1727
01:49:10,225 --> 01:49:11,453
We'll be blacked out.

1728
01:49:11,526 --> 01:49:14,654
It's just been announced over the radio
as a precaution against air raids.

1729
01:49:14,729 --> 01:49:17,095
On the radio, they say
everything is precaution.

1730
01:49:17,165 --> 01:49:18,496
They say there will be no war.

1731
01:49:18,566 --> 01:49:20,534
They say they're about to negotiate.

1732
01:49:20,602 --> 01:49:21,796
- Good evening, Miss Madou.
- Good evening.

1733
01:49:21,870 --> 01:49:24,134
- I want to see the colonel.
- I'll look for him.

1734
01:49:25,874 --> 01:49:27,136
Hey.

1735
01:49:27,208 --> 01:49:29,472
I cannot talk to her here in this uniform.

1736
01:49:29,544 --> 01:49:30,738
Tell her I see her outside.

1737
01:49:30,812 --> 01:49:32,006
You can talk to her here.

1738
01:49:32,080 --> 01:49:33,570
Not a soul will be here tonight.

1739
01:49:33,648 --> 01:49:34,637
Well...

1740
01:49:40,955 --> 01:49:42,889
- Please...
- There will be blackout any minute.

1741
01:49:42,957 --> 01:49:44,015
It was just announced.

1742
01:49:44,092 --> 01:49:45,389
- You're to hurry home.
- Please, Colonel...

1743
01:49:45,460 --> 01:49:46,620
You should not be out alone.

1744
01:49:46,694 --> 01:49:48,423
Where is he?

1745
01:49:48,496 --> 01:49:50,396
I do not know.

1746
01:49:50,465 --> 01:49:51,693
If they declare war,

1747
01:49:51,766 --> 01:49:53,700
they'll put Ravic
into a concentration camp.

1748
01:49:53,768 --> 01:49:56,362
You are the only one who can
give me a chance to see him.

1749
01:49:56,437 --> 01:49:58,428
Please, before it is too late.

1750
01:50:00,341 --> 01:50:01,865
All right, Joan.

1751
01:50:01,943 --> 01:50:03,069
If I see him.

1752
01:50:05,113 --> 01:50:06,273
I have your word?

1753
01:50:29,570 --> 01:50:31,731
Monsieur von Holn doesn't answer.

1754
01:50:31,806 --> 01:50:32,932
He must be in.

1755
01:50:33,007 --> 01:50:35,100
You'll keep ringing, please.

1756
01:50:49,157 --> 01:50:50,317
Where are you going?

1757
01:50:50,391 --> 01:50:51,517
To get my car.

1758
01:50:51,592 --> 01:50:52,991
You want to leave me.

1759
01:50:53,061 --> 01:50:54,653
No, no, no, no, no.
You wait here.

1760
01:50:55,997 --> 01:50:58,056
We closed up this place.

1761
01:50:58,132 --> 01:50:59,895
Wait here.

1762
01:51:13,247 --> 01:51:16,011
Tell me about this place
where we are going.

1763
01:51:16,084 --> 01:51:20,316
Well, select wines, exquisite service,

1764
01:51:20,388 --> 01:51:22,788
unbelievably pleasant company...

1765
01:51:22,857 --> 01:51:25,257
Sounds wonderful, wonderful.

1766
01:51:26,427 --> 01:51:27,553
But not cheap.

1767
01:51:27,628 --> 01:51:30,654
We Germans, you know,
limited foreign exchange.

1768
01:51:30,732 --> 01:51:34,828
Herr Ivon Haake, need I remind you
that in Paris you're my guest?

1769
01:51:34,902 --> 01:51:38,463
You are a true landsman.

1770
01:51:44,312 --> 01:51:45,574
It is 5:30.

1771
01:51:45,646 --> 01:51:46,670
Remember, good friend,

1772
01:51:46,748 --> 01:51:50,411
I must be in the
Gare du Nord by 9:00.

1773
01:51:50,485 --> 01:51:52,646
I will not see Paris again

1774
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:57,817
until I, through this
Arch of Triumph, march.

1775
01:52:00,695 --> 01:52:02,890
We have nearly four hours.

1776
01:52:02,964 --> 01:52:05,330
You'll make it easily.

1777
01:52:37,865 --> 01:52:38,991
Where are we?

1778
01:52:39,067 --> 01:52:40,534
The Bois de Boulogne.

1779
01:52:40,601 --> 01:52:42,193
How long are we driving?

1780
01:52:42,270 --> 01:52:43,703
Oh, ten minutes.

1781
01:52:43,771 --> 01:52:45,238
It has been longer.

1782
01:52:45,306 --> 01:52:46,432
Not much.

1783
01:52:46,507 --> 01:52:48,168
Before I was asleep, I looked at the time.

1784
01:52:48,242 --> 01:52:49,800
We are driving more than half an hour.

1785
01:52:49,877 --> 01:52:52,402
Really? I didn't think it was so long.

1786
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:53,469
We'll be there soon.

1787
01:52:53,548 --> 01:52:54,606
Where?

1788
01:52:54,682 --> 01:52:56,843
The place I told you about.

1789
01:52:58,152 --> 01:52:59,744
Drive back.

1790
01:53:00,955 --> 01:53:02,616
<i>- Now?
- Ja.</i>

1791
01:53:04,659 --> 01:53:05,717
Why?

1792
01:53:05,793 --> 01:53:07,260
Drive back.

1793
01:53:08,796 --> 01:53:10,024
All right.

1794
01:53:16,104 --> 01:53:17,867
Do we go back?

1795
01:53:17,939 --> 01:53:19,201
Yes.

1796
01:55:07,114 --> 01:55:08,809
...10 Downing Street.

1797
01:55:08,883 --> 01:55:13,377
This morning, the British
Ambassador in Berlin

1798
01:55:13,454 --> 01:55:17,550
handed the German government a final note,

1799
01:55:17,625 --> 01:55:23,188
stating that unless we heard
from them by 11:00

1800
01:55:23,264 --> 01:55:25,459
that they were prepared at once

1801
01:55:25,533 --> 01:55:28,434
to withdraw their troops from Poland,

1802
01:55:28,502 --> 01:55:32,939
a state of war would exist between us.

1803
01:55:33,007 --> 01:55:35,202
I have to tell you now

1804
01:55:35,276 --> 01:55:38,837
that no such undertaking
has been received,

1805
01:55:38,913 --> 01:55:40,938
and that consequently

1806
01:55:41,015 --> 01:55:44,883
this country is at war with Germany.

1807
01:55:50,558 --> 01:55:51,957
You heard?

1808
01:55:52,026 --> 01:55:53,618
Well?

1809
01:55:53,694 --> 01:55:57,960
I killed him in the Bois
and buried him in Saint-Germain.

1810
01:55:58,032 --> 01:55:59,590
Where is the car?

1811
01:56:01,269 --> 01:56:03,430
Rue Poncelet.

1812
01:56:03,504 --> 01:56:04,903
Everything is in order.

1813
01:56:04,972 --> 01:56:06,906
Nothing else to do?

1814
01:56:06,974 --> 01:56:08,965
Nothing.

1815
01:56:09,043 --> 01:56:11,534
I've got an horrific headache.

1816
01:56:11,612 --> 01:56:13,910
I want to sleep.
I'll come down later.

1817
01:56:13,981 --> 01:56:15,744
You did not forget anything?

1818
01:56:15,816 --> 01:56:17,841
No, I don't think so.

1819
01:56:17,918 --> 01:56:22,014
I've given up my room
at the Prince de Galles.

1820
01:56:22,089 --> 01:56:25,525
Madame Favier gave me
my old place here.

1821
01:56:25,593 --> 01:56:27,618
I can't go over the whole thing now.

1822
01:56:27,695 --> 01:56:29,128
First, I must sleep.

1823
01:56:29,196 --> 01:56:32,029
Did he ever find out who you were?

1824
01:56:32,099 --> 01:56:35,762
He didn't know who or why.

1825
01:56:54,288 --> 01:56:55,983
Ravic?

1826
01:56:56,057 --> 01:56:58,423
Hello? Ravic?

1827
01:56:58,492 --> 01:57:00,619
Answer me.

1828
01:57:00,695 --> 01:57:04,256
The colonel told me you're there.

1829
01:57:04,332 --> 01:57:07,062
I'm back at the Milan,

1830
01:57:07,134 --> 01:57:10,331
where you first brought me.

1831
01:57:10,404 --> 01:57:13,532
L... I've left him, Ravic,

1832
01:57:13,607 --> 01:57:16,770
and he's hurt me badly.

1833
01:57:16,844 --> 01:57:20,780
Come. Come quickly.

1834
01:57:20,848 --> 01:57:22,406
Quickly.

1835
01:57:27,288 --> 01:57:29,984
Dr. Ravic. Dr. Ravic.

1836
01:57:30,057 --> 01:57:31,649
Dr. Ravic, wake up.
You must wake up.

1837
01:57:31,726 --> 01:57:33,921
- Please do wake up.
- What do you want?

1838
01:57:33,994 --> 01:57:35,359
You must come immediately.

1839
01:57:35,429 --> 01:57:36,987
- It's Joan.
- What?

1840
01:57:37,064 --> 01:57:38,827
It was an accident.

1841
01:57:38,899 --> 01:57:41,163
You can't put the light on.
There's a blackout.

1842
01:57:41,235 --> 01:57:44,033
If I have to put a light on,
I'll put a light on.

1843
01:57:44,105 --> 01:57:45,163
Have you a taxi downstairs?

1844
01:57:45,239 --> 01:57:47,070
I have my car.

1845
01:57:47,141 --> 01:57:48,438
I shot her.

1846
01:57:50,044 --> 01:57:52,478
I pleaded with her not to leave me.

1847
01:57:52,546 --> 01:57:54,343
I only meant to threaten her.

1848
01:57:58,386 --> 01:57:59,648
What about the police?

1849
01:57:59,720 --> 01:58:01,017
No one heard me.

1850
01:58:01,088 --> 01:58:03,318
- Get my case together.
- Yes.

1851
01:58:43,898 --> 01:58:45,923
How did you get on the bed?

1852
01:58:46,000 --> 01:58:49,128
Alex. I couldn't walk.

1853
01:58:49,203 --> 01:58:52,036
Just after I telephoned you, I couldn't...

1854
01:58:52,106 --> 01:58:54,973
I couldn't move my leg or my arm.

1855
01:58:55,042 --> 01:58:56,839
What is it, Ravic?

1856
01:58:58,345 --> 01:58:59,471
Are you in pain?

1857
01:58:59,547 --> 01:59:00,639
Yes.

1858
01:59:00,714 --> 01:59:02,648
I'll give you something in a minute.

1859
01:59:06,487 --> 01:59:10,218
Call up Passy 2741.

1860
01:59:10,291 --> 01:59:11,315
Order an ambulance.

1861
01:59:11,392 --> 01:59:12,586
Yes.

1862
01:59:14,628 --> 01:59:15,788
Hello.

1863
01:59:15,863 --> 01:59:18,730
Passy 2741.

1864
01:59:18,799 --> 01:59:21,063
What is it, Ravic?

1865
01:59:21,135 --> 01:59:22,659
Nothing bad.

1866
01:59:22,736 --> 01:59:24,567
Send an ambulance immediately.

1867
01:59:24,638 --> 01:59:26,538
Hotel de Milan.

1868
01:59:26,607 --> 01:59:29,041
Rue Cardinal.

1869
01:59:29,109 --> 01:59:30,201
Room 8.

1870
01:59:34,782 --> 01:59:37,580
I don't want to be operated on.

1871
01:59:37,651 --> 01:59:39,812
Maybe we won't have to.

1872
01:59:41,889 --> 01:59:43,151
Is it serious?

1873
01:59:43,224 --> 01:59:45,852
No. Nothing serious.

1874
01:59:45,926 --> 01:59:47,985
They said the ambulance is coming.

1875
01:59:48,062 --> 01:59:50,929
Call up Auteuil 1357.

1876
01:59:50,998 --> 01:59:53,023
It's a hospital.
I'll talk to them.

1877
01:59:54,034 --> 01:59:55,558
1357.

1878
01:59:55,636 --> 01:59:56,762
Hello.

1879
01:59:58,272 --> 02:00:00,866
Auteuil 1357.

1880
02:00:00,941 --> 02:00:02,533
Ravic.

1881
02:00:04,044 --> 02:00:05,636
I don't want...

1882
02:00:05,713 --> 02:00:07,374
I don't want to have pain.

1883
02:00:07,448 --> 02:00:08,676
You won't.

1884
02:00:08,749 --> 02:00:11,650
I can't... I can't endure... I can't...

1885
02:00:11,719 --> 02:00:13,880
Doctor, it's the hospital.

1886
02:00:13,954 --> 02:00:15,854
All right. I'll be right there.

1887
02:00:15,923 --> 02:00:18,084
Hold it for a second.

1888
02:00:32,873 --> 02:00:34,204
All done.

1889
02:00:38,178 --> 02:00:39,577
Hello.

1890
02:00:39,647 --> 02:00:41,171
Hello, Geni?

1891
02:00:41,248 --> 02:00:43,478
Yes. Yes, a room.

1892
02:00:43,551 --> 02:00:46,111
And call up Veber.

1893
02:00:47,388 --> 02:00:51,222
Yes. Yes, have everything ready.

1894
02:00:51,292 --> 02:00:52,589
All right.

1895
02:00:52,660 --> 02:00:54,719
I've ordered an ambulance.

1896
02:00:56,397 --> 02:00:58,888
Yes. In ten minutes.

1897
02:00:58,966 --> 02:01:01,400
Oh, darling, darling,

1898
02:01:01,468 --> 02:01:03,834
I don't know what happened.

1899
02:01:03,904 --> 02:01:05,132
I don't know what happened.

1900
02:01:16,517 --> 02:01:17,814
I don't know...

1901
02:01:17,885 --> 02:01:19,250
Get up.

1902
02:01:22,489 --> 02:01:24,480
I didn't mean to do it.

1903
02:01:24,558 --> 02:01:26,219
Believe me, I didn't mean to do it.

1904
02:01:26,293 --> 02:01:28,284
Go down and wait for the ambulance.

1905
02:01:29,430 --> 02:01:30,624
Go on.

1906
02:01:40,608 --> 02:01:42,439
You'll help me.

1907
02:01:42,509 --> 02:01:45,069
Yes.

1908
02:01:45,145 --> 02:01:46,806
You're here.

1909
02:01:48,716 --> 02:01:53,551
I'm always at peace when I'm with you.

1910
02:02:30,190 --> 02:02:31,452
If you like, I'll call Baudet.

1911
02:02:31,525 --> 02:02:33,857
He could be here in 15 minutes.

1912
02:02:33,927 --> 02:02:36,623
You can assist him,
and he can do it.

1913
02:02:38,599 --> 02:02:41,159
No. No, it's too late.

1914
02:02:41,235 --> 02:02:42,668
I couldn't anyway.

1915
02:02:42,736 --> 02:02:45,000
Looking on would be worse.

1916
02:03:32,886 --> 02:03:34,979
Ravic.

1917
02:03:35,055 --> 02:03:36,249
Are you here?

1918
02:03:43,497 --> 02:03:44,862
Yes.

1919
02:03:44,932 --> 02:03:47,059
Did you operate?

1920
02:03:49,436 --> 02:03:51,495
No.

1921
02:03:51,572 --> 02:03:53,767
It wasn't necessary.

1922
02:04:01,014 --> 02:04:02,948
Will you stay with me?

1923
02:04:03,016 --> 02:04:04,506
Yes.

1924
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:08,515
Headache.

1925
02:04:08,589 --> 02:04:11,057
Oh, it feels like lead.

1926
02:04:11,125 --> 02:04:13,719
You'll be better soon.

1927
02:04:13,794 --> 02:04:16,729
Oh, it didn't ache so much before.

1928
02:04:16,797 --> 02:04:20,233
Oh, I don't want to suffer.

1929
02:04:20,300 --> 02:04:23,394
Ravic, promise I won't suffer.

1930
02:04:25,172 --> 02:04:28,107
My grandmother. I saw her.

1931
02:04:29,843 --> 02:04:32,778
I don't want that. Promise.

1932
02:04:32,846 --> 02:04:34,643
I promise.

1933
02:04:38,952 --> 02:04:40,510
What's wrong with my arm?

1934
02:04:42,389 --> 02:04:43,686
It will come back again.

1935
02:04:43,757 --> 02:04:45,918
And my leg.

1936
02:04:45,993 --> 02:04:47,290
It's the same.

1937
02:04:51,365 --> 02:04:55,563
Oh, I just intended to begin

1938
02:04:55,636 --> 02:04:58,400
to live differently.

1939
02:05:04,211 --> 02:05:07,180
What would have happened
without you?

1940
02:05:13,554 --> 02:05:15,818
Doctor, how is she?

1941
02:05:15,889 --> 02:05:18,119
I'm going in and find out.

1942
02:05:25,933 --> 02:05:28,197
The one time when I'm most needed,

1943
02:05:28,268 --> 02:05:31,760
all that I know,
all that I've learned, is nothing.

1944
02:05:39,112 --> 02:05:41,774
Poor France.

1945
02:05:41,849 --> 02:05:45,285
Yes, poor France.

1946
02:05:45,352 --> 02:05:48,082
And I'm afraid it's more
than France, Veber.

1947
02:05:48,155 --> 02:05:50,214
For me, it's France.

1948
02:05:50,290 --> 02:05:51,279
Of course.

1949
02:06:01,068 --> 02:06:02,160
Ravic.

1950
02:06:02,236 --> 02:06:03,601
I'm here, Joan.

1951
02:06:07,641 --> 02:06:11,077
What's the matter with my legs?

1952
02:06:11,144 --> 02:06:13,635
I can't move either one of them anymore.

1953
02:06:15,182 --> 02:06:18,743
You'll be able to walk as always
as soon as you get up again.

1954
02:06:23,290 --> 02:06:25,349
You don't have to lie.

1955
02:06:26,760 --> 02:06:30,127
You mustn't let me live

1956
02:06:30,197 --> 02:06:33,132
when I'm nothing but pain.

1957
02:06:33,200 --> 02:06:36,601
You must give me something strong,

1958
02:06:36,670 --> 02:06:39,696
strong enough for heaven.

1959
02:06:41,208 --> 02:06:42,903
You must do it,

1960
02:06:42,976 --> 02:06:46,139
even if I don't want you to.

1961
02:06:47,547 --> 02:06:48,707
Promise.

1962
02:06:48,782 --> 02:06:50,409
Joan...

1963
02:06:53,253 --> 02:06:56,222
It's all right for you to do it.

1964
02:06:56,290 --> 02:06:58,952
Without you,

1965
02:06:59,026 --> 02:07:01,221
I wouldn't be alive anyway.

1966
02:07:03,730 --> 02:07:06,164
You gave me this year.

1967
02:07:09,703 --> 02:07:14,163
Why didn't I stay with you?

1968
02:07:15,309 --> 02:07:17,300
It was my fault, Joan.

1969
02:07:17,377 --> 02:07:20,778
No.

1970
02:07:20,847 --> 02:07:23,839
It was... It was...

1971
02:07:23,917 --> 02:07:26,078
Oh, I don't know.

1972
02:07:26,153 --> 02:07:28,519
My head...

1973
02:07:28,588 --> 02:07:29,680
a light...

1974
02:07:29,756 --> 02:07:32,691
my eyes...

1975
02:07:48,008 --> 02:07:49,873
My eyes...

1976
02:07:56,249 --> 02:07:58,376
So much to tell you.

1977
02:07:58,452 --> 02:08:00,113
Later.

1978
02:08:00,187 --> 02:08:01,381
Later.

1979
02:08:03,156 --> 02:08:07,183
There's no more time to explain.

1980
02:08:07,260 --> 02:08:09,285
I think I know most of it.

1981
02:08:12,733 --> 02:08:13,757
You know?

1982
02:08:13,834 --> 02:08:15,802
I think so.

1983
02:08:15,869 --> 02:08:18,861
You know that I always...

1984
02:08:18,939 --> 02:08:22,102
Yes, Joan.

1985
02:08:22,175 --> 02:08:23,767
Strange.

1986
02:08:25,545 --> 02:08:27,945
It's strange to die...

1987
02:08:30,751 --> 02:08:33,743
when you love.

1988
02:08:33,820 --> 02:08:36,914
You are my life.

1989
02:08:36,990 --> 02:08:39,754
My arm.

1990
02:08:39,826 --> 02:08:42,454
My arm can never embrace you.

1991
02:08:42,529 --> 02:08:47,023
You are in my arms and I in yours.

1992
02:08:55,342 --> 02:08:56,969
I understand you.

1993
02:09:06,386 --> 02:09:08,854
"Love" is no word for it.

1994
02:09:08,922 --> 02:09:11,254
It isn't enough.
It's a small part only.

1995
02:09:11,324 --> 02:09:13,155
It is so much more.

1996
02:09:22,769 --> 02:09:24,293
Yes.

1997
02:09:24,371 --> 02:09:26,703
Yes, you are always with me,

1998
02:09:26,773 --> 02:09:28,934
no matter whether
I loved you, hated you,

1999
02:09:29,009 --> 02:09:30,806
or seemed indifferent.

2000
02:09:30,877 --> 02:09:33,846
That never changed anything.

2001
02:09:44,157 --> 02:09:46,148
You are always with me.

2002
02:09:58,004 --> 02:09:59,665
Ravic.

2003
02:10:01,875 --> 02:10:05,709
I was only more lost without you.

2004
02:10:05,779 --> 02:10:08,942
You were all the brightness

2005
02:10:09,015 --> 02:10:13,145
and the sweet and the bitter.

2006
02:10:23,263 --> 02:10:24,753
Doctor.

2007
02:10:25,966 --> 02:10:27,399
Dr. Ravic.

2008
02:10:29,436 --> 02:10:32,098
The patient in number 12 is dead.

2009
02:10:32,172 --> 02:10:33,662
You may notify the police.

2010
02:10:33,740 --> 02:10:35,002
Very well.

2011
02:10:41,715 --> 02:10:42,647
Do you live here?

2012
02:10:42,716 --> 02:10:43,648
Yes.

2013
02:10:43,717 --> 02:10:46,515
Take your place in line, please.

2014
02:10:46,586 --> 02:10:48,816
Hello, Boris. You, too?

2015
02:10:48,889 --> 02:10:51,687
This war, they want to see
everybody's papers.

2016
02:10:51,758 --> 02:10:53,953
I was asleep, idiot that I am.

2017
02:10:54,027 --> 02:10:55,460
I could have warned you.

2018
02:10:55,529 --> 02:10:56,689
I'm through running.

2019
02:10:58,298 --> 02:10:59,287
Next.

2020
02:11:00,600 --> 02:11:02,659
You know where they will put you.

2021
02:11:02,736 --> 02:11:04,363
I've been there before.

2022
02:11:04,437 --> 02:11:06,302
There is rumor they are going to set up

2023
02:11:06,373 --> 02:11:08,739
concentration camp at Longchamp.

2024
02:11:08,808 --> 02:11:11,276
Maybe they'll set us free again soon.

2025
02:11:11,344 --> 02:11:13,073
We can be used.

2026
02:11:13,146 --> 02:11:15,011
This is the end of our waiting, Boris.

2027
02:11:15,081 --> 02:11:16,173
- Next.
- Oh, no.

2028
02:11:16,249 --> 02:11:17,807
Not so fast.

2029
02:11:17,884 --> 02:11:19,442
Perhaps not.

2030
02:11:19,519 --> 02:11:21,783
But you will see the day.

2031
02:11:21,855 --> 02:11:22,879
Next.

2032
02:11:27,260 --> 02:11:28,284
Boris.

2033
02:11:30,096 --> 02:11:32,724
Joan is dead, shot by a man.

2034
02:11:32,799 --> 02:11:34,733
She is in Veber's hospital.

2035
02:11:34,801 --> 02:11:38,032
Will you see that she's buried?

2036
02:11:38,104 --> 02:11:40,095
No, don't ask questions.

2037
02:11:40,173 --> 02:11:42,505
Just say yes and be done with it.

2038
02:11:42,576 --> 02:11:44,874
- Yes.
- Next.

2039
02:11:44,945 --> 02:11:47,846
And take any of my things
that you can use.

2040
02:11:47,914 --> 02:11:49,347
Move into my room.

2041
02:11:49,416 --> 02:11:51,748
You always wanted my shower anyway.

2042
02:11:51,818 --> 02:11:53,080
All right.

2043
02:11:53,153 --> 02:11:55,644
After the war,
I will meet you at Fouquet's.

2044
02:11:55,722 --> 02:11:58,623
Which side, Champs-Elysées
or Georges V?

2045
02:11:59,693 --> 02:12:01,684
- Georges V.
- Good.

2046
02:12:03,763 --> 02:12:06,755
No, come here, idiot.

2047
02:12:06,833 --> 02:12:09,961
Don't we even dare
say good-bye decently?

2048
02:12:14,541 --> 02:12:16,702
God bless your eyes.

2049
02:12:28,488 --> 02:12:31,480
