1
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,870
Oh, my God, it's the baby!

2
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,716
Are you all right?

3
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:37,795
I'm frightfully sorry.
It appears you've missed your bus.

4
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,797
I'm terribly sorry, I--

5
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:16,554
-Missed your bus.
-I don't own a bus.

6
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:18,039
I'll buy you one.

7
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,033
How nice, a rich Yank. No, thank you.

8
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,272
If you don't want a bus,
how about some coffee?

9
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,874
I don't drink coffee.

10
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,038
I drink tea.

11
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,875
There probably won't be a bus
along here for some time.

12
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:35,554
Probably not.

13
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,395
You really drink this, don't you?

14
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,315
No, we just like to pour it into cups
and stir it. Why did you ask?

15
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,837
-It tastes too much like boiled water.
-It is boiled water.

16
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,831
I knew there was a reason.

17
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,437
-Where are you from?
-Chicago.

18
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,389
-Where gangsters come from.
-Some come from Detroit.

19
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,313
-Chicago grows the best.
-You a gangster?

20
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:23,637
Twelve arrests, no convictions.

21
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,074
-Nobody looks like that in a uniform.
-How should I look?

22
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,393
-Like a short man.
-Your boiled water's getting cold.

23
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,552
Then let's order some more.

24
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,795
Please.

25
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,676
All right.

26
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:01,435
-What about you?
-What about "what about me?"

27
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:04,433
Who are you? What are you?

28
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:10,709
I'm a short man, born in London.
I've lived here all my life.

29
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,668
-What do you do here?
-I work in a hospital.

30
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:18,748
I tell men they'll be all right
and they believe me...

31
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,831
...because they want to.

32
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,677
Then I watch them die.
I want it to all end.

33
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:33,717
-I'll win the war for you.
-That would be nice.

34
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,029
-Are you stationed here?
-Our base is an hour from here.

35
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:43,556
-I get a day every couple of weeks.
-You're a pilot?

36
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,199
B-25s.

37
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:48,716
-Do you like to fly?
-I hate to walk.

38
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:54,079
-My name's Halloran, what's yours?
-Tell me about America.

39
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,357
-I think you're lovely.
-Tell me about Chicago.

40
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,353
Chicago's windy.
Something's happening here.

41
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,114
-Please don't.
-Please don't what?

42
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,192
-I have to go.
-I don't want you to go.

43
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,796
-I shouldn't be here.
-Yes, you should.

44
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,955
I have to go.

45
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,594
-I have to catch the bus.
-Don't leave.

46
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,194
-I want to see you again.
-You can't.

47
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:28,196
-Look, I just have a few hours.
-Please don't do this to me.

48
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:32,069
-We've got to get into a shelter.
-I'm sorry, I can't--

49
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:34,231
Why?

50
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,399
You're trying to go away again,
but I'm not gonna let you.

51
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,795
I'm not gonna let you.

52
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,919
-I can't think. I have to go home now.
-I'll take you there.

53
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:12,755
No, you can't.
I have to go.

54
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:17,630
My name's David Halloran,
I'm from Chicago. I won't let you go.

55
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,872
-Tell me your name.
-I'm sorry.

56
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,510
-You won't tell me your name?
-Please let me go.

57
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,798
I have to see you again.
My next day off is in two weeks.

58
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,714
-I can't.
-Meet me here Thursday.

59
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,190
-No!
-On the same corner. Right here.

60
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:38,875
-I won't be here.
-I will, I'll be here all day.

61
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,954
-Please don't, I won't come.
-I'll be here.

62
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,875
We can't act like nothing's happened.
There's not enough time.

63
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:57,879
It's too late.

64
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:29,957
The objective this morning
is this airfield north of Rouen.

65
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:33,829
Reconnaissance showed
we didn't do too well last night.

66
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,993
These dark circles here
are fuel storage tanks.

67
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:44,076
They're under concrete, so it'll take
more than one hit to knock them out.

68
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,518
Again, recon photos show
they didn't take even one direct hit.

69
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,591
We'll approach from the east.

70
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,036
We'll have the sun at our backs
and in their eyes.

71
00:12:55,200 --> 00:13:00,149
How come he says "we"?
He's not going. We're we.

72
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,838
We expect light to moderate flak.
We'll approach from 12,000.

73
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,233
Cloud cover at 6 to 8000.
We'll drop at 6000.

74
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:15,428
-I wish I were going with you.
-We'll stay, you can go.

75
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,672
Lt. Halloran?
Something you want to say?

76
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,708
I'm sure no one wants to miss
whatever you have to add.

77
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:24,632
Yes, sir, what?

78
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:30,075
No one wants to miss anything,
except I don't have anything to add.

79
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:34,233
So there's nothing
for any of us to miss, sir.

80
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,591
Takeoff is at 0800.
Good luck, gentlemen.

81
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:57,119
-What is " light to moderate flak"?
-Less than heavy flak.

82
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:02,877
-It's more than no flak.
-He wishes he could go with us.

83
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,077
Somebody's got to stay behind
to volunteer us.

84
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,549
Radio check.

85
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,796
<i>Pilot to tail, okay?</i>

86
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:22,475
<i>Everything's fine, sir.</i>
<i>Radio's okay, ammo's okay.</i>

87
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,791
<i>Radio check, pilot to waist.</i>
<i>Giler?</i>

88
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,518
<i>-Yes, sir?</i>
<i>-How we doing?</i>

89
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,717
<i>All set, sir.</i>
<i>Radio's okay, ammo's okay.</i>

90
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:33,269
<i>Radio check, pilot to turret. Lucas?</i>

91
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,991
<i>Yes, sir. Ready, sir.</i>
<i>Ammo's okay, radio's okay.</i>

92
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,834
<i>Bomb bay closed?</i>
<i>Flaps locked.</i>

93
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,355
<i>Cimino?</i>

94
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,355
<i>I don't understand. They make it</i>
<i>so hard to get in these things.</i>

95
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:54,308
<i>I don't even want to be here</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

96
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:02,031
<i>I understand making it hard to</i>
<i>get out, everybody wants to get out.</i>

97
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:07,959
<i>These things are made of metal.</i>
<i>Ever try to pick one up? You can't.</i>

98
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:14,036
<i>You know why? Because it's made of</i>
<i>metal and metal's heavy, very heavy.</i>

99
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:17,351
<i>Don't believe me?</i>
<i>Just try and pick one up.</i>

100
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:21,718
<i>You'll see. You'll wrench your back,</i>
<i>that's what you'll do.</i>

101
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,795
<i>Air isn't heavy, you know?</i>
<i>This pile of junk is heavy.</i>

102
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:30,316
<i>Heavier than air. Much heavier.</i>

103
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:36,112
<i>Don't you see? This thing</i>
<i>is not supposed to be up in the air.</i>

104
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:40,355
<i>Jesus, I hate these things.</i>

105
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:48,670
<i>We're 20 miles from target,</i>
<i>descending, bombs away at 6000.</i>

106
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:53,069
Roger, Pacer Leader.
Descending to 6000.

107
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,912
<i>This is leader. Maintain positions,</i>
<i>we are 12 miles from target.</i>

108
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,959
<i>Rate of descent, 1000 feet per minute.</i>

109
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,951
They're shooting guns at us.

110
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:12,836
Somebody forgot to tell the Germans
they should only have light flak.

111
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,069
<i>Bomb bay open.</i>

112
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,637
<i>Seven miles to target.</i>

113
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,435
Feather it.

114
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,549
-It's feathered.
-Let's turn back.

115
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,032
-How far from target?
<i>-Five miles. Turn back!</i>

116
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,395
-He's right.
-Have to slow to 200.

117
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:46,155
-We'll be sitting ducks.
-We'll get our asses shot off!

118
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,198
<i>How far from target?</i>

119
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,033
Three miles. Am I the only one
who's not crazy?

120
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,236
Ever take a look at Hyer?

121
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:58,871
<i>If there's a God, he doesn't send Hyer</i>
<i>to prep school and Yale...</i>

122
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:03,272
...to let him die in a plane.
So as long as we're with him...

123
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:06,034
<i>... the Krauts can't get at us.</i>

124
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,830
I'm messy enough to take Hyer down
with me! We're over the target.

125
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,629
<i>I'm gonna drop the bombs</i>
<i>and let's get out of here!</i>

126
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:15,789
Just a second.

127
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,077
We're over it,
the engine's falling off!

128
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:24,589
-Chief, what do you think?
-It'll hold, if you wanna wait.

129
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,993
Terrific, we've got Sergeant York
on the plane. I hate you, Lucas!

130
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,233
We're over the goddamn target,
let me drop the bombs.

131
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,231
We're over the target!

132
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,598
You're early because
you're afraid the wing will fall off.

133
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:45,834
-I'm gonna wait a few more seconds.
-I hate Lt. David Halloran!

134
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,231
-Serial number 057327--
-969.

135
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,550
Let him drop the bombs!

136
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:56,191
<i>If we don't hit the target now,</i>
<i>we'll have to come back again.</i>

137
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,273
-Now we're really over the target!
-Well, drop the bombs!

138
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:05,869
<i>They're away.</i>

139
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,390
<i>Jesus, I hate these things.</i>

140
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,560
I was there on Hanover Street
for over an hour, just watching you.

141
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:04,555
-I was afraid, so I stayed hidden.
-Are you still afraid?

142
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:11,068
Yes. I wasn't a few minutes ago,
when we had something to do...

143
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:14,596
...but now I just feel awkward again.

144
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:19,238
-I don't know what I'm doing here.
-Yes, you do.

145
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:21,994
Yes, I do.

146
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:30,798
-I'm not hungry anymore.
-Neither am I.

147
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:36,276
Thursday. I can get back to London
next Thursday.

148
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,156
-Tell me your name.
-I can't.

149
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,197
-Please?
-No.

150
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,999
I'm frightened.
It's happening so fast.

151
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:49,753
I'll bet your name is really Fred.
You're embarrassed.

152
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:55,149
Hey, Fred...

153
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,754
...I think I love you.

154
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:03,229
Yes.

155
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,472
<i>Leader to group, we are 20 miles</i>
<i>from target, begin your descent.</i>

156
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:11,916
<i>-Bombs away at 8000 feet.</i>
<i>-10,000.</i>

157
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,234
Open bomb bays.

158
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,029
<i>Bomb bays open.</i>

159
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:25,796
They're shooting guns at us again.
How come they do that every time?

160
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:29,396
<i>-We drop bombs on them.</i>
-They have no sense of humour.

161
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,118
Can't you take a joke?

162
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:34,677
<i>-9000.</i>
<i>-Five miles to target.</i>

163
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:38,279
-How far is target now?
<i>-Three miles.</i>

164
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:42,228
-Altitude?
-8500.

165
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,951
We're almost over the target.

166
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:51,832
-Altitude?
-8200.

167
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:55,516
-8100.
-Cimino, drop them!

168
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,354
<i>They're away.</i>
<i>Halloran, I love you!</i>

169
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,634
There really is a God,
ladies and gentlemen.

170
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,189
I'm going to church
when we get back.

171
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:10,036
<i>So I haven't been in a while,</i>
<i>I missed a few Sundays.</i>

172
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,312
What's a cross between
a parakeet and a tiger?

173
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:22,069
-I give up. What?
-I don't know, but if he sings, listen.

174
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,392
You think that's funny?
You're a wretched child.

175
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:28,233
-lf I am, it's your fault.
-Really? Why?

176
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,313
Mrs. Thomas said children
are a reflection of their parents.

177
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:37,349
-But Dennis doesn't have a moustache.
-He's a reflection of his mother.

178
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,956
Dennis calls his parents by their
names. It's smashing.

179
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,235
Really?

180
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,989
I'm too old to keep on calling you
Mummy and Daddy.

181
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:51,109
-You only call me Daddy, not Mummy.
-I think I shall call you Paul.

182
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,590
-lf that's what you'd like.
-Yes, Paul.

183
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:59,117
-And I shall call you Margaret.
-And I'll call you Rover.

184
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:04,150
-No, I'll call you Mummy.
-For a short person, you're not bad.

185
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,078
-More tea?
-I'd love some.

186
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:10,393
Judy Fox stole my keychain,
you know the one with the clover?

187
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,357
-Stole it?
-Yes.

188
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,033
How do you know?

189
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:17,710
I brought it to school.
I was changing after gym...

190
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:20,718
...and I couldn't find it. She had it.

191
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:25,835
When I said it was mine she said she'd
always had it.

192
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,315
And I know it's mine.

193
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:31,830
Everyone has to be nice,
because her father died.

194
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,276
-When did he die?
-A few months ago, in Africa.

195
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:40,560
She says it's hers. It isn't. I'm glad
you're intelligent. You won't die.

196
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,794
I'm in Intelligence. And you should be
especially kind to her now.

197
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:49,350
-You won't die, will you, Daddy?
-Wasn't it Paul?

198
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,990
Promise me.
And you will always love me?

199
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:57,153
-I'll always love you.
-And you'll always love Mummy?

200
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:59,470
-Even when you're 80?
-Yes.

201
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,838
I'll have to put my false teeth in
to kiss her.

202
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,117
-We're going back to Rouen.
-I'm gonna be sick.

203
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:20,751
We believe the Krauts are sending
an ammunition train south.

204
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,355
They'll expect us.
It won't be easy.

205
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:26,713
-You'll get lots of flak.
-Definitely sick.

206
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,679
Halloran, you fly lead.
Packman, second.

207
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:35,119
You've got cloud cover from 8 to
10,000. Make the drop at 6000.

208
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,317
I know what it's gonna be like,
so be careful.

209
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,634
He flew 100 missions over Texas
and he knows what it's gonna be like.

210
00:27:43,880 --> 00:27:47,714
We should have 5- to 10-mile
visibility below 8000.

211
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,030
Approach from south to north.

212
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:54,193
Nobody ever took Texas
while he was there.

213
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,039
Takeoff is at 0830.

214
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:05,389
Good luck. I wish I could've gone
with you. Dismissed.

215
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:11,112
Lt. Halloran, I'd like
to speak with you for a moment.

216
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,877
Take it easy with him. Don't say
anything you'll regret later.

217
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:23,792
Don't take it easy. Say something
you'll regret, maybe we'll be grounded.

218
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,276
Sit down, lieutenant.

219
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:35,990
In every group of men, there's
one man looked up to for leadership.

220
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,789
In this group,
you happen to be that man.

221
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:43,669
You set a good example,
the others will follow.

222
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,395
You've got the makings
of a very fine officer.

223
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:51,030
You could go far, very far.

224
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,556
It's your attitude that concerns me.

225
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,871
-You understand what I'm saying?
-No, sir.

226
00:28:58,040 --> 00:29:00,679
I don't like you either, buster!

227
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,509
Stop crapping around in the briefings,
you understand?

228
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:07,837
-No, sir.
-What do you mean, no?

229
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:11,919
No, sir. I don't understand.
What crapping around, sir?

230
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:15,959
You're a wiseass.
You even say "sir" like a wiseass.

231
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,639
How should I say it?

232
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:20,798
I'm gonna get you.
That's what I'll do.

233
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,918
Blink the wrong way
and I'm gonna nail you.

234
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,153
-You understand?
-Yes, sir, you're gonna nail me.

235
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:32,040
You get the hell out of here!

236
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:47,276
-You okay? What did he say?
-That he didn't like my attitude.

237
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,830
-Lucas, did you check this gear?
-Sure, I always do.

238
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,312
-Tire pressure?
-Fine, sir. What's the matter, sir?

239
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,358
Check it again.

240
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,516
I like this attitude.

241
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:08,389
It's different,
but it's one fine attitude.

242
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:18,230
When I was little, I spent summers at
my grandfather's. It was like this.

243
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:22,359
You worked on a farm?
You don't seem like the farm type.

244
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,876
-I can milk a cow.
-Her ladyship can milk a cow.

245
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,190
-She can.
-With her own hands?

246
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,992
No, with her feet. Why is it
so incredible? Lots of people can.

247
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,357
-Haven't you ever?
-I opened a bottle once.

248
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,670
Don't they drink milk in Chicago?

249
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,958
How do you think baby gangsters
grow up to be big gangsters?

250
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,474
-There's a place to eat.
-I'm famished.

251
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:51,428
So am I. I want some tea.
I love tea.

252
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,591
-Did I ever tell you that?
-No.

253
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:56,877
It's true, I drink it all the time.

254
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,275
-Halloran?
-Yes?

255
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:07,637
-I love you, my name is Margaret.
-No kidding?

256
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,189
No kidding.

257
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:14,831
-You love me?
-I love you.

258
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,994
-Your name is Margaret?
-My name is Margaret.

259
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:24,235
Maggie, I like the name Maggie.

260
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:30,271
I can't stop it, you know,
no matter how hard I try.

261
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,632
It terrifies me
how much I want you.

262
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:42,599
It must be wrong to want someone
this urgently.

263
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,349
And know later that I'll feel guilty.

264
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:51,352
Later I'll hurt terribly.

265
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:56,751
Except I'm with you now,
and that's all I can think about.

266
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:07,396
-I love you, Margaret.
-I love you, Halloran.

267
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:15,756
-Captain Sellinger, you've met Lester.
-Yes, sir, I have.

268
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,638
New tobacco.

269
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,397
-Do you like it?
-It seems very pleasant.

270
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,596
Aromatic.

271
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,472
-Bad business, very bad.
-I beg your pardon?

272
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,554
As you know, one of your agents,
Reed, was dropped in Lyon.

273
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:39,793
Two weeks later he was killed.
A month ago you sent another.

274
00:33:40,040 --> 00:33:44,716
-Forbes. A good man.
-Yesterday we heard he was found dead.

275
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,630
What do you think?

276
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,788
I trained both of those men.

277
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,838
I knew them well, very well.

278
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:06,439
They wouldn't make mistakes so glaring
they'd be found out in two weeks.

279
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,511
There's a leak.

280
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:10,830
There has to be a leak somewhere.

281
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:14,675
Their identities had to have
been known before they went.

282
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:17,752
It would take that long
just to find them.

283
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,080
There's a double agent,
fairly high up.

284
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:24,473
-That's the only explanation.
-I agree.

285
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,909
Forbes' last communication was that the
Gestapo has a list of double agents.

286
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,595
He was trying to get it.
That's the last we heard.

287
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:42,590
This is bloody awful. It may smell
good, but it tastes like hell.

288
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,309
Someone will have to get that list.

289
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:53,839
-In Gestapo headquarters in Lyon?
-That's where the list is.

290
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,548
He had three children.

291
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,551
-Did you say something?
-I said Forbes had three children.

292
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:08,676
We'll have to do this differently.
No one outside this room may know.

293
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:13,072
-No one in OSS, no one in G2.
-He can't transmit the list back.

294
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,916
He'll have to copy it and bring it
back without the Germans knowing.

295
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:21,755
-Who do we have?
-Two. McCallum and Wells.

296
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,953
-I say Wells.
-Quite right.

297
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:28,273
-Work with him.
-I'm not sure he's ready.

298
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,988
You make him ready.

299
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:37,112
That's better. They can put
that aromatic in their noses.

300
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:46,788
Oh, God, I think I'm going to die.
Look, isn't she beautiful?

301
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:51,397
-Yes, she is.
-Isn't she the most beautiful thing?

302
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:56,634
-Who's more beautiful than she is?
-You are.

303
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,960
She closes her eyes
and her hair curls.

304
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:02,838
She's a wonderful doll.

305
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,514
Let's think of what to get Daddy.

306
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:10,310
-Why did you want me to see the doll?
-No reason in particular.

307
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:13,996
-It has nothing to do with Christmas?
-Of course not.

308
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:16,879
-When will I get breasts?
-Next week, why?

309
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,636
-Sometimes I think they look silly.
-They look best with formal wear.

310
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:24,997
-What would Daddy like?
-Anything you get.

311
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:28,038
I want to get him something special.

312
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:31,476
-What about a tie?
-Daddy has ties.

313
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:36,953
-Daddy has most things.
-I want to get what he doesn't have.

314
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:38,872
Get him a dress.

315
00:36:39,320 --> 00:36:43,632
Just get him something you like.
He'll love it if it's from you...

316
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:47,679
...not because it's blue or red.
Because it's from you.

317
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,912
-Do you know any Germans?
-Not too many.

318
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:54,470
-What are they like?
-Probably very much like us.

319
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:58,155
Are German children buying
presents for their fathers?

320
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,470
I suppose so.

321
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,713
Handkerchiefs! Let's get Daddy
handkerchiefs!

322
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,632
It looks like the propellers
spin backwards.

323
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,271
-The propeller's spinning backwards?
-Forget it.

324
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:23,560
<i>-I'm supposed to forget it?</i>
-It's an optical illusion--

325
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:25,756
-Forget it.
-Illusion, my ass!

326
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,434
How do you know forward
from backwards?

327
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:32,115
<i>If we land in New York,</i>
<i>the propeller spins backwards.</i>

328
00:37:32,280 --> 00:37:33,713
I hope it's backwards.

329
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,030
<i>-Leader to tower.</i>
<i>-This is tower.</i>

330
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,839
<i>-Starting taxi.</i>
<i>-Roger, leader.</i>

331
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,151
<i>Just my luck,</i>
<i>they're spinning forward.</i>

332
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:47,633
Want me to take it up for you?

333
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,271
No.

334
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:06,350
<i>-Listen to number one.</i>
<i>-Why? What's wrong?</i>

335
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,911
<i>-Something doesn't sound right.</i>
<i>-Leader, this is tower. Over.</i>

336
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:15,551
<i>One second, tower. Over.</i>
<i>Check the rpms.</i>

337
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,915
<i>-Rpms normal.</i>
<i>-Oil pressure?</i>

338
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,513
<i>Leader to tower.</i>

339
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:24,151
<i>Lucas, are you hearing number one?</i>
<i>Something doesn't sound right.</i>

340
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,675
<i>-Check the gauges?</i>
<i>-Gauges are okay.</i>

341
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:31,072
<i>-Can't tell from here.</i>
<i>-I hear something wrong.</i>

342
00:38:32,440 --> 00:38:36,319
Something's not right.
Gauges don't always show it.

343
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:40,075
<i>Leader, this is tower.</i>
<i>Please answer. Over.</i>

344
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:45,955
-Tower, this is leader.
<i>-Begin your takeoff.</i>

345
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,315
I've got a problem with
my number one, I'm coming back.

346
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,678
<i>I've got a problem with</i>
<i>my number one, I'm coming back!</i>

347
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,549
<i>You're returning to base.</i>
<i>Packman, you're the new leader.</i>

348
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:06,431
<i>-Roger, Tower.</i>
<i>-Price is number two, Anderson follows.</i>

349
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:12,118
<i>-Packman, you're cleared for takeoff.</i>
<i>-Roger, Tower, cleared for takeoff.</i>

350
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:18,195
It's very late. If you want Christmas
to come, go to sleep now.

351
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,716
-I can't sleep.
-I know, but you have to.

352
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:24,952
Father Christmas won't come
until you're asleep.

353
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,749
-It's the rules.
-I just want to say hello to him.

354
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,118
-Won't the Germans shoot him?
-Of course not.

355
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:37,558
-Anything I get will make me happy.
-Of course.

356
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:44,068
-Nothing in particular that you want?
-Oh, no. Nothing in particular.

357
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:48,119
It would be nice, though,
if I had a friend to play with.

358
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:54,230
-I'll have another baby.
-Not a real person. Just a-- You know!

359
00:39:54,400 --> 00:40:00,032
I haven't the faintest idea what you're
talking about. Good night, old friend.

360
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:02,919
Dream sweet dreams,
tomorrow is Christmas.

361
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:06,868
If you don't go to sleep now,
I'll strangle you.

362
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,954
Well, young lady,
if you're not tired, I am.

363
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,671
-Wait until you see what I got you.
-lf it's from you, I'll love it.

364
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:20,751
Good night.

365
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:35,959
I'm sound asleep.

366
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,593
-Did you put her present out?
-Yes, it's in the living room.

367
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:47,509
Her glazed little eyes
staring at the window.

368
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:51,475
-What does she want with another doll?
-God knows.

369
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,514
I've never seen a child
want anything more.

370
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,119
Sarah's hands are so small.

371
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:04,599
During the day when she's rushing
around, she doesn't seem so small.

372
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:10,560
When she's in her bed and she's
sleepy I think she shrinks.

373
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,711
I know what you mean.

374
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:16,116
It's so strange.

375
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:20,509
It's Christmas Eve,
and we're fighting a war.

376
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:26,470
Fighting wars never seemed
to make much sense.

377
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,553
It just seems it makes less sense
on Christmas Eve.

378
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,155
I wonder what the other side
is thinking right now.

379
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,717
-Night, darling.
-Good night.

380
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:10,112
-I love you.
-I love you.

381
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,189
-Harriet, your throat is beautiful.
-My name is Phyllis!

382
00:43:03,400 --> 00:43:06,915
Of course it is,
your throat's beautiful too.

383
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:10,078
-Do you want to dance?
-Susan, darling...

384
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:15,195
...ordinarily, that would be
a wonderful suggestion.

385
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,552
-However, since the injury....
-What injury?

386
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:23,799
-I don't like to talk about it.
-You were wounded?

387
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:26,878
Just a little shrapnel in the leg.

388
00:43:27,080 --> 00:43:31,949
-How come they didn't send you home?
-I wouldn't go.

389
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:35,118
Nothing will keep me from flying.

390
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:39,472
-Oh, lieutenant--
-Paula, my sweet...

391
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:44,754
...it's nothing to make a fuss about.
Sometimes the pain....

392
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:49,715
What's life without pain?
How about another drinkie?

393
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:53,399
Hey, Cimino.

394
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,119
You gotta help me.

395
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:59,592
Have you met Barbara?
Have you ever seen such a throat?

396
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,959
I got this one all primed, but
she won't leave her friend.

397
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:08,870
I suspect that blue eyes don't see
so good. Too much inbreeding.

398
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:14,552
-Have you taken a good look at Dorothy?
-What am I gonna do?

399
00:44:14,760 --> 00:44:18,275
-Give one to Halloran.
-I don't think so.

400
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:23,679
It's a terrific idea! Come on, Rita,
we're gonna go be with Halloran.

401
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,679
-I thought you had an injured leg!
-My God, I can walk again!

402
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,952
Ladies, this is our leader.
Leader, these are our ladies.

403
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,039
This is Elizabeth. Meet Halloran.

404
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,708
-This is Audrey.
-Phyllis!

405
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:52,277
-Where are you from?
-Illinois.

406
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:57,233
Aren't the decorations pretty?

407
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,749
Let's go somewhere private.

408
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:05,159
-I want to stay here.
-It's Christmas! I am your serviceman.

409
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:08,875
-Alone, overseas.
-I want to stay here!

410
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:13,752
Marion, perhaps you are a spy.

411
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:17,476
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

412
00:45:17,680 --> 00:45:21,309
Let me put it another way.
Let's fool around.

413
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:24,114
-Okay.
-There is a God.

414
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:27,919
They're back.

415
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:32,308
-Where's Packman?
-He'll be here.

416
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:33,709
Who's Packman?

417
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,914
My luscious Linda, he's a brave soul
who flew lead instead of us...

418
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,511
...because of a port engine
with the holiday spirit.

419
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:48,593
They'll be here in a minute.

420
00:45:55,120 --> 00:45:58,351
-Hey, Pete.
-Halloran. How you doing?

421
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,074
-How did it go?
-Bad. We lost three.

422
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:07,396
-Hey, you are one lucky son of a bitch!
-Where's Packman?

423
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,433
Never saw a plane break
into so many pieces.

424
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:11,675
Where's Packman?

425
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:15,310
He took a hit in the bomb bay
with a full load.

426
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,750
-Maybe he bailed out.
-No way.

427
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,673
I never saw so many little pieces.

428
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:25,396
Where's Cimino? I wanna tell him.
If it wasn't for your engine...

429
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:30,799
...it would've been you. I wanna tell
Cimino to go kiss that engine.

430
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:37,908
What's the matter?

431
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:41,317
You heard it, didn't you?
Something was wrong.

432
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:43,516
-Sit down.
-You heard something.

433
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,196
Every time an engine starts I hear
something.

434
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:50,550
It was something!

435
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,311
It was.

436
00:46:58,440 --> 00:47:01,989
Ladies, let's play follow-the-leader.

437
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:04,589
Come on, Francine.

438
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:16,435
You found it, didn't you?
Goddamn you! You found it!

439
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:19,313
-I don't know.
-Tell me you found it!

440
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:21,158
Take it easy!

441
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:24,870
-He heard it!
-Excuse me. Don't go away.

442
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,155
Hi, guys.

443
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,158
I heard it.
I heard it!

444
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,159
I heard it, believe me.
Captain, I heard it!

445
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,960
-I thought we were gonna play?
-No.

446
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,760
Believe me, Packman!

447
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,916
I heard it, Packman!

448
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:45,872
Goddamn you, Packman!

449
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,316
Please don't smoke.

450
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,189
Lieutenant Wells...

451
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:19,671
...English is a language
you do not understand.

452
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:22,474
You have never spoken a word.

453
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,195
They didn't teach you
English in Essen.

454
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,756
You must never speak in English
or respond to it...

455
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,959
...even around here, no matter what.
If it's in English...

456
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,995
...you do not understand. Even if
it's the PM himself talking to you.

457
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:42,954
One slip like that
and you're quite dead.

458
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:47,517
All right, lesson over.
It's time we took a break.

459
00:49:48,240 --> 00:49:53,553
Don't be discouraged, you're doing
fine. Come on, I'll pay for the tea.

460
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:57,389
Come on, it's all right.

461
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:01,832
Lt. Wells, class is over
for the afternoon.

462
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,035
Sometimes when we're together...

463
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:25,109
...I feel so close that I don't know
where I end and you begin.

464
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:29,910
I never knew it could be like that.

465
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:34,432
I was 19 when I got married.
He was the only man I'd ever known.

466
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:41,312
I never felt I lacked anything, it's
just I wasn't sure if this was it.

467
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:48,830
If this was everything. Maybe that's
why I went with you that first day.

468
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:55,034
It's so damned unfair. I try
so hard to forget you, I really do.

469
00:50:55,760 --> 00:51:01,630
I spend all my time trying to forget
you, so I think of you all the time.

470
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:05,116
I don't want to hurt anybody.

471
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:12,872
Sometimes I sit at the dinner table
with him and I watch him...

472
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:16,390
...and I want him so desperately
to do something...

473
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:20,513
...or say something
or be something that I can hate.

474
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,552
But he never does.
I've hurt him so much.

475
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,719
It makes me hate myself
and wish I've never met you...

476
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:32,514
...but then when I'm with you...

477
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:37,597
...and it's so strong and
I don't ever want to let you go.

478
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:43,431
Why don't things work
the way they're supposed to?

479
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,632
I don't know how
things are supposed to work.

480
00:51:46,840 --> 00:51:50,116
I don't know anymore
what I heard in that engine.

481
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:57,913
Before, a propeller could have fallen
off and I wouldn't have gone back.

482
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:02,113
It's easy to be brave when you haven't
got anything to lose.

483
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:04,635
I'm scared now.

484
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:07,638
I don't wanna die
and not see you anymore.

485
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:12,709
Nothing makes sense until I'm with you,
then everything makes sense.

486
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:19,837
I don't wanna let you go.
I wanna be with you all the time.

487
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,673
I don't wanna wake up and not know
if I'll see you.

488
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,155
I'm tired of missing you.

489
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:31,156
I'm in pieces.
I want you to put me back together.

490
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:35,911
Hold me now,
make everything outside go away.

491
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,553
On my way in to see you...

492
00:52:39,760 --> 00:52:42,957
...I was trying to
think of a way to tell you...

493
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:46,197
...we should stop seeing each other.

494
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,198
I did the same thing.

495
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:55,152
Here are your two main types:
your combination lock...

496
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:58,909
...and your key lock.
With your combination lock...

497
00:52:59,120 --> 00:53:02,715
...which works with a series
of tumblers...

498
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,675
...you have to find out whether it's
a three- or four-number combination.

499
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,668
Then, whether you move
to the right or the left.

500
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:16,158
If it's your key lock, it's
a matter of finding the proper key.

501
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:20,035
In the absence of a key,
a common problem...

502
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:24,358
...there are certain instruments
that do a right proper job.

503
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:29,634
-It's a matter of learning to use them.
-How long will it take?

504
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:36,110
You've got to understand, opening these
is not something any old bloke can do.

505
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:41,348
-It's a gift, if I do say so myself.
-Let's say Lt. Wells is gifted.

506
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:46,680
A key lock, a couple of days,
a combination lock, six months.

507
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:52,193
-We're interested in a Cona 335.
-That's a Jerry safe.

508
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,154
-We are at war with the Germans.
-You've got a point.

509
00:53:56,360 --> 00:53:59,272
-Which is it?
-It's a key lock.

510
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:05,032
Any schoolkid could crack it. In fact,
I cracked one when I was a schoolkid.

511
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:11,554
Right. Now, gentlemen, here you have,
before your very eyes, your lock pick.

512
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:16,675
You have here your safe, which is
almost the same as your Cona 335.

513
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:22,876
Insert your lock pick
into your Cona 335...

514
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,516
...feeling your way
through the elements.

515
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:30,309
For your information,
there happen to be four.

516
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:35,829
One.

517
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:40,158
Two. Three.

518
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:43,518
Four.

519
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:54,152
Apple pie. Bleeding apple pie.

520
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:03,035
-Nice to see you, lieutenant.
-Nice to see you.

521
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:05,959
Why don't you sit down?

522
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:13,638
I have a little problem.
It's a special mission.

523
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:18,156
The group said they needed a volunteer.

524
00:55:18,360 --> 00:55:22,239
It's risky, so they wanted
to put it on a voluntary basis.

525
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:27,230
It's for tomorrow night.
Oh, about the other day...

526
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,956
...the mechanic couldn't find
a thing wrong with that engine.

527
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:38,599
If you felt there was something wrong,
I'm sure there was. If you heard it....

528
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:44,397
A mechanic's not a pilot. I don't
listen to any kind of rumour. Never.

529
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,319
There's been a lot of talk around.

530
00:55:48,040 --> 00:55:51,669
You can't pay any attention
to that kind of talk.

531
00:55:51,880 --> 00:55:57,591
I don't believe for a moment
that you made the whole thing up.

532
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:02,555
Not a word. Just gossip.
Now, where was I?

533
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,230
Oh, yeah. That mission tomorrow night.

534
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:10,194
I knew that you'd want
to volunteer to do it.

535
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,914
Not that you've
got anything to prove.

536
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:17,955
I just felt that you'd like
to go for it.

537
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:22,273
I told Operations to have
those engines double-checked.

538
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:28,510
I'm sure you won't be disappointed
and have to cancel that flight.

539
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,156
-Is he ready?
-As ready as he ever will be.

540
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:35,554
What do you mean?

541
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:40,794
I can't be too specific.
There's nothing wrong with Wells.

542
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,594
I'd prefer he was more spontaneous.

543
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:47,150
-Spontaneous?
-He learns what he's taught.

544
00:56:47,360 --> 00:56:51,911
But I'm not sure how he'll react
if something unforeseen happens.

545
00:56:52,120 --> 00:56:56,113
-Prepare him for everything.
-That would be nice.

546
00:56:56,320 --> 00:57:00,518
New stuff, this.
Supposed to be a cooler smoke.

547
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:04,030
We're not going to send Wells
on a regular flight.

548
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:07,909
We have to be paranoid
about the leak in Intelligence.

549
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:12,591
We're going to drop him
in a totally different way.

550
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:17,510
If this is cool, I'd hate to think
what they call hot.

551
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:25,473
We won't use Intelligence. We won't
even use a transport aircraft.

552
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:30,037
As a matter of fact, we're not
even using a British aircraft.

553
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:34,119
Would you come with me
to that tobacconist?

554
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:08,312
Hello, how have you been?

555
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:12,719
-Hello, handsome.
-What's it today?

556
00:58:12,920 --> 00:58:15,115
I do hope you like potatoes.

557
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,795
-Your dinner is served, my lord.
-I'll take it in the study.

558
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,912
Very good, my lord.

559
00:58:28,640 --> 00:58:30,949
-There's a call for you.
-Where?

560
00:58:31,160 --> 00:58:32,957
At the nurses station.

561
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:40,998
Hello? Hello?

562
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,998
I can't hear, it's madness here. Paul?

563
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,192
Yes. Can you hear me now?

564
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:50,949
-Better. You'll have to speak up.
<i>-Is this all right?</i>

565
00:58:51,160 --> 00:58:53,435
<i>-Is anything the matter?</i>
-No, no.

566
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:59,033
I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
I just wanted to hear your voice.

567
00:58:59,240 --> 00:59:03,711
Of course you haven't disturbed me.
I'm glad to hear your voice too.

568
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,917
I love you, Margaret.

569
00:59:07,080 --> 00:59:08,354
I love you too.

570
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:12,553
-I know I'm not that special.
-Of course you're special.

571
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:18,357
No, I'm not and we both know it.
It's just my curse to be so ordinary.

572
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:21,916
I do so want to be dashing.

573
00:59:22,120 --> 00:59:25,396
<i>I can't blame you</i>
<i>for finding me unexciting.</i>

574
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:30,873
Why are you talking like this?
You're very special. And dashing.

575
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:33,548
<i>Mrs. Sellinger, ward 4.</i>

576
00:59:33,760 --> 00:59:37,070
<i>-I didn't mean to disturb you.</i>
-I'm glad you called.

577
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,236
<i>Mrs. Sellinger, ward 4.</i>

578
00:59:39,440 --> 00:59:44,833
-I have to go, they're calling me.
-I understand. Talk to you later.

579
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,759
-I love you.
<i>-Paul--</i>

580
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:26,916
-<i>Yes, Captain Sellinger?</i>
-Could you get me Lt. Wells, please?

581
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:37,238
<i>-Hey, it's dark out.</i>
<i>-No kidding?</i>

582
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,351
<i>Really, I wouldn't fool you.</i>

583
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:44,230
<i>-Why are we the only plane taking off?</i>
<i>-We got a special mission.</i>

584
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:49,792
<i>Lucky us. When it's dark out,</i>
<i>you can bump into things.</i>

585
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:54,551
<i>-I'll be real careful.</i>
<i>-Hey, Cimino, where are the bombs?</i>

586
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:57,479
<i>We're a bomber. We drop bombs.</i>

587
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:02,959
<i>No bombs. I like that.</i>
<i>Bombs are dangerous, they can blow up.</i>

588
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:08,280
<i>We're waiting for an English guy</i>
<i>named Wells. We're gonna drop him.</i>

589
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,677
<i>I like that, dropping a person.</i>

590
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,952
<i>People don't blow up like bombs.</i>

591
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:18,678
<i>-Starting port engine.</i>
<i>-Starting port engine.</i>

592
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,633
<i>How do they sound?</i>

593
01:01:30,840 --> 01:01:35,516
<i>They sound fine. Even if they don't</i>
<i>sound fine, they sound fine.</i>

594
01:01:36,000 --> 01:01:41,393
<i>-Where the hell's that English guy?</i>
<i>-It's dark, maybe he's not so stupid.</i>

595
01:02:05,760 --> 01:02:09,196
-Is this Wells?
-There's been a change of some kind.

596
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:12,039
Captain Sellinger, Lt. Halloran.

597
01:02:26,160 --> 01:02:27,388
Hello?

598
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,558
-Mummy!
-Hello, darling.

599
01:02:31,360 --> 01:02:33,032
Your hair smells nice.

600
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:36,471
-Mrs. Carling got soap in my eyes.
-Did you cry?

601
01:02:36,680 --> 01:02:40,355
Wouldn't you cry
if she got soap in your eyes?

602
01:02:40,560 --> 01:02:42,949
-Where's Daddy?
-He went out.

603
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:47,711
-Mrs. Carling gave me dinner.
-Did he say where he was going?

604
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:51,549
He left a note on the pillow.
I think that's romantic.

605
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:10,079
What does Daddy say? Is it mushy?

606
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:17,273
-Daddy has to go away on a little trip.
-When will he be back?

607
01:03:17,480 --> 01:03:21,393
-Very soon.
-Your coat's all wet.

608
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:24,791
I did a painting of
a Tyrannosaurus Rex in orange.

609
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:27,679
Have you ever seen an orange one?

610
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:31,919
Come and look at it.
Mummy, come on!

611
01:03:36,720 --> 01:03:40,793
I don't mean to be pushy, but
that Englishman isn't English.

612
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,959
He's your actual Kraut.
You can tell by his collar.

613
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:49,995
I forgot to tell you.
We're on the German side now.

614
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,237
<i>-I like the uniforms.</i>
-Sellinger, are you okay?

615
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:54,799
Quite well.

616
01:03:55,000 --> 01:03:57,958
We're over France.
We'll avoid the Germans.

617
01:03:58,160 --> 01:04:03,280
-This mission's not that crazy.
-We'll drop you through the hatch.

618
01:04:03,480 --> 01:04:06,517
<i>Keep your arms tight to your body.</i>

619
01:04:06,720 --> 01:04:09,154
I shall remember, thank you.

620
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:15,030
Jesus Christ!

621
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,595
How bad is it?

622
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:33,792
No. It's a mistake.
You're not supposed to die.

623
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:39,955
-It's all a mistake.
<i>-Lt. Halloran! Are you all right?</i>

624
01:04:40,160 --> 01:04:45,154
-We're hit up here. It's bad.
-I'm afraid we've been hit back here.

625
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,715
<i>-How bad?</i>
-I think they're dead.

626
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,833
Lucas? Giler? Cimino?

627
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:53,519
Cimino!

628
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:05,873
Cimino, don't do this.
Please don't--

629
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:17,199
Oh, my God.
He has no face.

630
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,275
Your men back there...

631
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:24,718
...they're dead.

632
01:05:26,840 --> 01:05:28,910
He has no face.

633
01:05:53,960 --> 01:05:58,715
Keep your arms tight!
Don't pull the ring till you're clear!

634
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:56,911
It's like someone took a vacuum
cleaner and straightened out the mess.

635
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:00,710
They're all gone.

636
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:07,071
It's not right.
They should have left a mark.

637
01:07:07,280 --> 01:07:09,316
I'm really sorry.

638
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:13,111
I know how you feel.

639
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:18,590
-I'm so sorry I caused all this.
-It's not your fault.

640
01:07:19,200 --> 01:07:21,316
You know where we are?

641
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,792
20 miles south of Lyon.

642
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:27,316
Well, that's where I have to go.

643
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:32,315
I gotta make my way to the Channel.
That's the other direction.

644
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:37,316
-Good luck.
-Thank you. Thank you for everything.

645
01:07:40,080 --> 01:07:44,471
I beg your pardon, lieutenant.
Lyon is north of here, you say?

646
01:07:44,680 --> 01:07:46,750
Yeah. I'm pretty sure.

647
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:52,629
I hate to impose,
but do you know which way is north?

648
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:56,799
-Yeah, that way.
-Thank you again.

649
01:08:01,560 --> 01:08:04,199
Oh, damn!

650
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:09,190
Lt. Halloran, I'm sorry
to be such a burden to you...

651
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:12,119
...but would you mind giving me a hand?

652
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:28,516
It's sprained, it'll be sore for
a while. Can I ask you a question?

653
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:29,715
Sure.

654
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:35,956
You don't seem to know north from south
and you fall on your ass immediately.

655
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:39,112
-Have you ever done this before?
-No.

656
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:43,598
Wonderful.
You look real spiffy in uniform.

657
01:08:44,840 --> 01:08:49,311
I don't want to go with you.
You don't know what you're doing.

658
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:53,069
And I certainly
don't know what I'm doing.

659
01:08:53,280 --> 01:08:57,319
But here I am, as we speak,
going with you.

660
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:01,914
-We'll get our asses shot off.
-I'm really grateful.

661
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,714
That's just swell.

662
01:09:09,920 --> 01:09:11,069
Hello?

663
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,879
<i>Mrs. Sellinger? This is Major Trumbo.</i>

664
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,390
Oh, my God. It's Paul.
Is he all right?

665
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:20,398
<i>The plane he was on was shot down.</i>

666
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:26,436
I have no more information, but it's
possible he bailed out and he's fine.

667
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:28,232
I just don't know now.

668
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:31,315
<i>Mrs. Sellinger, are you there?</i>

669
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:36,709
<i>As soon as I learn more, I'll call.</i>
<i>Your husband's a good man.</i>

670
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:42,358
I'm sure he's fine, I just can't
understand why he replaced Wells.

671
01:09:42,560 --> 01:09:45,154
<i>Not like him to be so impulsive.</i>

672
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:50,388
<i>I'll call you as soon as I learn</i>
<i>anything. I'm sure he's fine.</i>

673
01:09:50,600 --> 01:09:52,750
<i>Mrs. Sellinger, are you there?</i>

674
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,712
Thank you.

675
01:09:56,040 --> 01:09:58,508
Thank you for calling.

676
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:24,675
Mummy, is everything all right?

677
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:34,039
-How far do you think we've gone?
-You're the spy.

678
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:37,755
-Don't you have a manual?
-Yes, we do.

679
01:10:37,960 --> 01:10:40,872
-Didn't you ever read it?
-I wrote it.

680
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:44,436
-What does it say about distances?
-I forget.

681
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:47,518
We're gonna get our asses shot off.

682
01:12:56,560 --> 01:13:01,509
Give me a hand, she's gonna kill me.
She thinks I'm German.

683
01:13:01,720 --> 01:13:05,395
I wonder why she thinks
you're German?

684
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:09,989
Betty Grable, Hershey bars,
Yankee Stadium. Hello, Joe.

685
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,310
She had a brother who was killed
by the Germans.

686
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:22,548
Her father wouldn't do anything.
He's a collaborator. Out of fear.

687
01:13:22,760 --> 01:13:26,230
She says she's doing
what he should be doing.

688
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,795
It's his car,
she says we can take it.

689
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:48,117
-This will work out rather well.
-I'm thrilled.

690
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:54,555
As an SS officer, I'm entitled to
an aide. You won't look out of place.

691
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:59,311
-Where won't it look out of place?
-At Gestapo headquarters in Lyon.

692
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:04,513
You've got a right to get killed,
I have a right to live.

693
01:14:04,720 --> 01:14:09,316
I appreciate your position, but
I don't think I can do this alone.

694
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:13,433
My leg is hurt and this thing
is important.

695
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:17,394
I don't speak German,
in case you didn't notice.

696
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,674
If you don't speak to anyone,
no one will know. That makes sense.

697
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:24,518
Shit.

698
01:15:11,280 --> 01:15:14,556
Get rid of the cigarettes.
And the lighter.

699
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:16,716
They're American.

700
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:25,277
-Do you mind if I ask you something?
-Not at all.

701
01:15:25,480 --> 01:15:29,109
Why did you decide to go
instead of Wells?

702
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,756
That's complicated.
I don't know how to answer that.

703
01:15:32,960 --> 01:15:34,393
Try.

704
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:41,469
All my life, no matter what I did,
I've always been the same thing.

705
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:46,196
Pleasant. I'm pleasant. I was
a teacher, a pleasant profession.

706
01:15:46,400 --> 01:15:50,598
I'm pleasant-looking.
If anyone were to describe me...

707
01:15:50,800 --> 01:15:56,238
...they'd say I was pleasant.
I never minded it that much before.

708
01:15:56,440 --> 01:16:00,638
Except now it's beginning to hurt.

709
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,116
-More than I thought it could.
-What do you mean?

710
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:07,357
-Look at yourself.
-I can't, I'm driving.

711
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:11,075
Take a good look
at yourself and you'll see a hero.

712
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:13,111
I don't want to be a hero.

713
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:19,714
You are one, you can't help it.
When the boy falls through the ice...

714
01:16:19,920 --> 01:16:24,630
...you save him. I'm the one who
gives you my coat to wrap him in.

715
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:30,995
When it's all over, you're in the
paper, saying it was really nothing.

716
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,997
And I have a wet coat.

717
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:18,520
Are you kidding?

718
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:23,032
You're supposed to
open the door for me.

719
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:45,835
They've changed it.
They put in a combination safe.

720
01:19:46,040 --> 01:19:50,318
-I have no idea how to open it.
-I love it.

721
01:19:54,960 --> 01:20:00,318
-Mrs. Sellinger, what a surprise.
-I'm sorry to barge in like this.

722
01:20:00,520 --> 01:20:05,355
I haven't heard anything since
last night and I'm beside myself.

723
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:09,633
-I was hoping you'd have news.
-Won't you sit down?

724
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:11,717
Would you like some sherry?

725
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:14,878
-Cigarette?
-What the hell happened?

726
01:20:16,440 --> 01:20:21,036
We don't know. The plane is missing.
Not a word. Not a trace.

727
01:20:21,240 --> 01:20:25,438
-I can't understand Paul's actions.
-I can.

728
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:29,349
-Really, why?
-It's not something I can explain.

729
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:33,874
I'll contact you
as soon as I hear anything.

730
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:39,074
I spoke to the American colonel,
Bart, and they're waiting too.

731
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:43,751
-Who's Colonel Bart?
-Paul was in an American plane.

732
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:47,714
-Bart is the wing commander.
-Where's he located?

733
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:51,873
-At Windsor Field.
-Thank you, major.

734
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:56,471
-I'm sorry for pestering you.
-Seeing the colonel won't help.

735
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:00,992
-He knows no more than I do.
-I'm sure you're right.

736
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:04,158
Thank you again.

737
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:43,718
Are you out of
your goddamn mind?

738
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,874
-Mrs. Sellinger?
-Yes.

739
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:18,469
I'm Colonel Bart.

740
01:28:18,680 --> 01:28:23,674
-It's nice of you to see me.
-Not at all. Will you sit down?

741
01:28:25,920 --> 01:28:30,357
You must think I'm a pest.
I have to know what's happened.

742
01:28:30,560 --> 01:28:35,031
Yes, of course. Well, we've received
no notification of survivors.

743
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:37,391
Can't send reconnaissance in.

744
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:41,149
We can't draw attention
to the mission, understand?

745
01:28:41,400 --> 01:28:42,549
No, I don't.

746
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:48,153
-There's every chance they bailed.
-But you don't know for sure.

747
01:28:48,360 --> 01:28:53,957
No. But I do know that if they did,
your husband is in very good hands.

748
01:28:54,160 --> 01:28:59,712
The pilot, Lt. Halloran, is a very
determined, very resourceful man.

749
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,954
Apple pie?

750
01:29:37,320 --> 01:29:39,311
We did it.

751
01:29:39,800 --> 01:29:42,519
We actually did it!

752
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:48,074
-We're still not out of France.
-We'll get out, all right.

753
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:52,108
It would be silly to have come
this far and not get out.

754
01:30:06,120 --> 01:30:11,478
I can go back now.
I can be more for her to see.

755
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,834
-She must be very special.
-She is.

756
01:30:15,040 --> 01:30:17,998
Have you ever felt that way
about any woman?

757
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:23,832
Yeah, I do now.
Except with me it's different.

758
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:26,753
Since I met her,
I don't know who I am.

759
01:30:27,000 --> 01:30:30,834
I know who you are.
You're a good and brave man.

760
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,758
I don't feel very brave.

761
01:30:33,000 --> 01:30:39,155
-That's absurd. Look what you've done.
-All I did was try to stay alive.

762
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:44,514
-I was just too scared to die.
-Only frightened men are brave.

763
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:48,355
Men who aren't frightened
are insane. You're only brave...

764
01:30:48,560 --> 01:30:53,554
...when there's something
to lose and you still try.

765
01:30:53,800 --> 01:30:55,518
When we get back...

766
01:30:55,720 --> 01:30:58,712
...go to her, hold her...

767
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:00,512
...and never let go.

768
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:03,518
That's what I'll do
when I see Margaret.

769
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:09,314
Tell me more. What's her name?

770
01:31:09,520 --> 01:31:13,354
Margaret.
God, I love that name, don't you?

771
01:31:13,680 --> 01:31:14,669
Yeah.

772
01:31:14,880 --> 01:31:18,190
How do I tell you about her?

773
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:23,428
If there's such a thing as one woman
for you, it's Margaret for me.

774
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:28,356
I know it sounds like something
out of <i>Mother Goose</i>, but it's true.

775
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:32,957
We have a daughter, Sarah.
She looks like her mother...

776
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:36,954
...which is reason enough
to think she's beautiful.

777
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,316
This is Margaret.

778
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:47,311
-She's lovely, isn't she?
-Yeah.

779
01:32:02,280 --> 01:32:05,909
She says there's a bridge
eight kilometres from here.

780
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,759
A resistance group is waiting for us.

781
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,116
Come on, old man!

782
01:32:18,320 --> 01:32:20,311
Eat something.

783
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:25,712
-Here's your watch.
-Thanks.

784
01:32:31,000 --> 01:32:35,312
Son of a bitch! The girl's father
must have called the Germans!

785
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,518
Perfect!

786
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,911
Will you come on!

787
01:35:03,800 --> 01:35:06,837
I think I left
my kidneys back there.

788
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,116
You still got your ass.

789
01:36:21,080 --> 01:36:24,709
-I can't go back!
-I'm too scared to argue! Come on!

790
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:27,349
You're gonna
get us both killed.

791
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:29,636
When you get
back to London...

792
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:34,556
...please, look up my wife.
Her name's Margaret. Please.

793
01:36:34,800 --> 01:36:37,314
Tell her I died a brave man.

794
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:40,472
Tell her yourself!

795
01:37:17,080 --> 01:37:20,390
I get the wet coat again.

796
01:37:22,720 --> 01:37:26,474
No. This time you get the girl.

797
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:33,754
No, you don't. Not now.

798
01:37:34,000 --> 01:37:36,514
You die on me, I'll kill you.

799
01:37:42,160 --> 01:37:45,152
Want to play cards?
I feel like demolishing you.

800
01:37:45,320 --> 01:37:48,869
You're trying to be cheerful,
you're worried about Daddy.

801
01:37:49,040 --> 01:37:51,315
He's going to be all right.

802
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:57,712
I love you more than it's
possible to love anyone, you know.

803
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,917
Hello?
Yes.

804
01:38:08,360 --> 01:38:12,876
Mummy, is it good crying
or bad crying?

805
01:38:13,080 --> 01:38:15,310
I knew it.

806
01:38:17,600 --> 01:38:23,709
-Capt. Sellinger, which ward is he in?
-442, just down the corridor.

807
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,320
Hello, old friend.

808
01:38:56,360 --> 01:39:00,319
It's so unfair for anybody's
eyes to be that colour.

809
01:39:01,280 --> 01:39:02,759
I try.

810
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,312
Me too.

811
01:39:10,600 --> 01:39:15,913
-Are you all right? Are you hurt?
-I was lost, but I think I'm back.

812
01:39:17,240 --> 01:39:20,038
I just wish your eyes
weren't that colour.

813
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:25,033
There's a man in a
room down there...

814
01:39:25,280 --> 01:39:26,952
...a good man...

815
01:39:27,200 --> 01:39:29,316
...I wish he wasn't.

816
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:35,757
When I heard you'd been shot down
together, it felt like punishment.

817
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,514
Then, after a while...

818
01:39:40,560 --> 01:39:45,315
...I knew that you'd take care of him,
and you would come back.

819
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:52,799
I love you enough to let you go, which
is more than I've ever loved anybody.

820
01:39:53,000 --> 01:39:56,709
I wish I didn't cry
all the damn time.

821
01:39:58,880 --> 01:40:02,919
I will never care for anyone
the way I care for you.

822
01:40:05,320 --> 01:40:08,517
And to think it had to
work out this way.

823
01:40:08,760 --> 01:40:11,718
Things work out the way
they're supposed to.

824
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:17,673
And listen. You've got to go to
him and I've got to walk away.

825
01:40:18,200 --> 01:40:21,988
That's what we have to do.
You know that and I know that.

826
01:40:22,520 --> 01:40:26,832
I'm entirely capable of messing
this up, so you must help me.

827
01:40:27,480 --> 01:40:30,711
-I love you, Halloran.
-I love you, Maggie.

828
01:40:33,120 --> 01:40:35,714
Think of me when you drink tea.

829
01:44:17,760 --> 01:44:18,954
