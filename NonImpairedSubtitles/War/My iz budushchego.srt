6
00:01:31,647 --> 00:01:37,127
- Medal for "Bravery"
- So, how much for everything?

7
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:38,638
Can you drop the price?

8
00:01:39,689 --> 00:01:40,931
.... for wholesale buyer?

9
00:01:40,966 --> 00:01:43,053
- Look, Spirit
- What?

10
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:46,487
... you.. With this Borman
how long have you been digging?

11
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,172
- 2nd year
- And how is it making out?

12
00:01:48,208 --> 00:01:50,334
Depends on how lucky you get
and how hard you work

13
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:54,686
Ashota, our competitor, is digging 
with magnetic finders and other gadgets

14
00:01:54,722 --> 00:01:57,125
and they are making $500/month

15
00:01:57,161 --> 00:02:00,658
So why are you wasting time with Borman?
Go to Ashota

16
00:02:00,693 --> 00:02:04,156
Ha Ha! we made $4K in 2 month with Borman! 

17
00:02:05,926 --> 00:02:09,851
He's got the nose for it. 
Hasn't asked us to dig a single empty hole. 
Without any magnetic finders

18
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:13,967
- Lucky?
- Neah, educated. He was 'history' major,
till they kicked him out

19
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:15,852
Somebody ratted out his business

20
00:02:15,888 --> 00:02:18,766
- Chuha, how do you know all this?
- We go way back, went to the same kinder garden.

21
00:02:18,802 --> 00:02:21,527
Metaphorically speaking ..
we were raised on the same piss pot.

22
00:02:21,561 --> 00:02:22,199
I see.

23
00:02:22,926 --> 00:02:25,019
- "Bravery" medal
- Yep.

24
00:02:25,054 --> 00:02:27,115
and to "Achievements in combat" 

25
00:02:27,327 --> 00:02:30,843
It's nice to deal with you, -
you don't jack up the price

26
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:32,756
shake on it.

27
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:35,605
(crown yelling "Gorka" to newly weds)

28
00:02:36,768 --> 00:02:38,918
Listen, turn this crap off! 

29
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:40,653
You're shit!

30
00:02:40,687 --> 00:02:43,128
What did you say? don't understand 
Russian any more? 

31
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:44,197
Let me go, come on!

32
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:46,237
get out of my car.

33
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:48,972
Tell him not to touch me anymore.

34
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:51,726
Cherep (skull), your job is to dig, 
not to damage my hired labor.

35
00:02:51,763 --> 00:02:53,844
- he started it...
- Tomorrow at 6, I'm not waiting.

36
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:58,559
Chuha, you hear me? If you're late, 
you'll be hiding from the Military Draft

37
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:04,683
- What? subway? 
- We'll walk

38
00:03:05,246 --> 00:03:09,006
- Kick his ass!
- Come on! Come on!

39
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,921
Kick his ass! harder!

40
00:03:19,448 --> 00:03:23,493

Our territory, here is our home. )

We'll always be #1 here
Don't cross our way)

While burning life
So what!)

49
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:15,774

The fact is, we're the best here! )

00:05:07,568 --> 00:05:09,127
Please, sit down 

55
00:05:09,246 --> 00:05:11,841
- What? 
- Please, sit down.

57
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:14,443
Thanks much.

58
00:05:31,606 --> 00:05:32,926
Ashot!

59
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:36,320
(WHISTLING)

60
00:05:37,607 --> 00:05:40,200
Ashot. Bitch, digging our spot!

61
00:05:41,488 --> 00:05:43,092
- Did you see that?
- So.

62
00:05:43,127 --> 00:05:44,572
- Did you see that?
- I know. So.

63
00:05:44,607 --> 00:05:46,484
Here, take your hatchet and get the fuck out

64
00:05:46,567 --> 00:05:48,652
What, you think you bought this land?

65
00:05:48,687 --> 00:05:51,884
You think this ground is yours 
just because you marked it with sticks?

66
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:53,156
What?!

67
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:12,117
Where are you going?! Freeze!

68
00:06:18,727 --> 00:06:20,047
Sergey!!

69
00:06:31,248 --> 00:06:38,567
Listen, Ashot. If I see you here again,
I'll have to kill you. Got it? 

70
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:41,206
- Got it. 
- Ok. We're done then. 

71
00:07:06,808 --> 00:07:09,366
- You think you came here to sleep?
- Piss off, it's my lunch time.

72
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:10,767
It's his lunch time.

73
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:14,244
Borman, war is war, 
but lunch has to be on time.

74
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:19,117
Go, figure out some food, 
see what we have.

75
00:07:19,847 --> 00:07:22,519
Here. Thanks.

76
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:27,243
Cherep, don't you want to put 
some symbols on your forehead?

77
00:07:31,846 --> 00:07:35,124
So... here...
Where..?

78
00:07:36,769 --> 00:07:39,360
Guys, who took the canned food?

79
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:40,731
What do you mean "took"?

80
00:07:40,766 --> 00:07:44,087
We had 3 yesterday, 
today only 1 left.

81
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:46,043
and only 1/2 of bread.

82
00:08:04,967 --> 00:08:08,126
- Why are you looking at me for?
- Who else are we to look at?

83
00:08:08,163 --> 00:08:09,491
What are you doing, Bitch?

84
00:08:09,528 --> 00:08:11,928
How was I to know I was taking the
last of it? It was dark at night.

85
00:08:11,963 --> 00:08:13,485
You're such a cunt!

86
00:08:13,968 --> 00:08:16,093
Left everyone without food.

87
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,002
Telling you right away, I will NOT allow to be beaten.

88
00:08:19,007 --> 00:08:22,683
Hey, Borman, come on! 
I'll make up for it, 
I'll dig like a tractor!

89
00:08:23,007 --> 00:08:25,521
You're not getting paid for today.

90
00:08:26,008 --> 00:08:29,007
Now go to the store in the village,
buy some food.

91
00:08:29,043 --> 00:08:31,213
- Me? Alone?
- You'll go with him.

92
00:08:31,246 --> 00:08:34,524
Buy Vodka at the store, otherwise we'll 
get poised by that home made crap.

93
00:08:38,248 --> 00:08:41,372
What about change?
Till the last penny.

94
00:08:41,406 --> 00:08:43,047
- Dumbass.
- I'll show you "Dumbass"!

95
00:08:44,087 --> 00:08:46,300
Cherep, why the hell did you
come here with us?

96
00:08:46,336 --> 00:08:48,517
I want "steel cross",  or a German knife

97
00:08:48,849 --> 00:08:50,997
- I see.
- But if I find Walther (german pistol), I'll be very happy

98
00:08:51,528 --> 00:08:54,918
Of course, no skinhead is complete without a Walther

99
00:08:56,648 --> 00:08:58,428
Your must be reading "Main Kamph" aloud in your group?

100
00:08:58,462 --> 00:09:00,172
By the way, it's a worthy book.

101
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:02,292
Right. So, you're praying to Hitler?

102
00:09:02,326 --> 00:09:06,767
If I were Stalin, I'd join Hitler and 
take control over the U.S.

103
00:09:06,802 --> 00:09:11,407
You're so dumb, Cherep, whatever was left
of your brain got washed down your stomach. 

104
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,128
But your brain is so large it's 
squeezing out into this infestation farm.

105
00:09:16,165 --> 00:09:17,606
Gorilla

106
00:09:23,206 --> 00:09:25,767
- Piss off!
- What? Come here!

107
00:09:25,802 --> 00:09:27,485
Piss off!

108
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:30,562
Cherep, for last time, piss off!

109
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:32,212
Where?

110
00:09:32,246 --> 00:09:34,760
- Cherep, I'll kill you!
- Where?

111
00:09:37,047 --> 00:09:38,812
Get off me!

112
00:09:38,846 --> 00:09:43,207
- Are you death? Don't touch my dreadlocks! Bitch!!
- Don't move, or it won't come out straight.

113
00:09:43,243 --> 00:09:45,517
Fascist! Bastard! Bitch!

114
00:09:51,486 --> 00:09:55,719
Listen, Chuh, I'm reading some 
German's diary, he was fighting here in 1942

115
00:09:56,246 --> 00:09:58,920
That 'oper Bonhof' is describing the war in August

116
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,761
Awesome.

117
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:20,448
Spirit - is cool, he's got it right. 

118
00:10:20,482 --> 00:10:22,767
Let's go eat something? we bought everything.

119
00:10:22,802 --> 00:10:23,802
Let's go work "something".

120
00:10:27,207 --> 00:10:28,641
let's go.

121
00:11:19,328 --> 00:11:21,079
Aaaaa !

122
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:36,239
What's this here?

123
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:44,838
Wow.

124
00:12:03,325 --> 00:12:05,370
Quiet, don't move. 
We don't want to blow ourselves up.

125
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:07,213
And don't hide it for yourself
We figure equal shares for everyone.

126
00:12:07,246 --> 00:12:10,203
- It's you who steals food at night,..
- Quiet.
- ...look what I found.

127
00:12:10,487 --> 00:12:12,365
- quiet-quiet-quiet.
Go get a flashlight.
- Ok.

128
00:12:12,402 --> 00:12:14,279
Get over here. Here
Stand up and don't move.

129
00:12:18,407 --> 00:12:20,796
- Nurse?
- Yes, nurse.

130
00:12:21,528 --> 00:12:23,643
You can always tell a woman.

131
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:28,000
Borman, flashlight!

132
00:12:29,846 --> 00:12:31,121
Give me.

133
00:12:31,448 --> 00:12:32,640
Well, beautiful

134
00:12:37,405 --> 00:12:38,998
Careful.

135
00:12:42,246 --> 00:12:44,000
Officer's bag.

136
00:12:50,888 --> 00:12:53,445
"August 23rd, 1942 ...

137
00:12:53,888 --> 00:12:55,116
Dear Mother..."

138
00:12:55,288 --> 00:12:56,162
Damn!

139
00:12:56,206 --> 00:12:58,723
"...it's been a while since I've written to you. 
We start advancing soon. 

140
00:12:58,758 --> 00:13:01,238
My soldiers are in a good mood..."

141
00:13:04,247 --> 00:13:06,013
I bet it's a letter by an officer.

142
00:13:06,046 --> 00:13:08,195
Is it possible he was fighting Bonhof here?

143
00:13:09,846 --> 00:13:15,284
Borman! Captain and safe

144
00:13:15,927 --> 00:13:17,804
3 "Cubic" - lieutenant major

145
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:21,797
This is probably his watch.

146
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:27,408
- 6:42, precise time
- What?
- They were killed at 6:42.

147
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:28,556
Take the safe.

148
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,355
Come on.

149
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:35,166
"TT". (Russian pistol model by Makarov)

150
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:38,841
Finally.

151
00:13:41,768 --> 00:13:42,836
Take the light.

152
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:45,755
- This is the shit
- Open it.

153
00:13:46,848 --> 00:13:48,963
Ok, what you got?

154
00:13:50,407 --> 00:13:52,565
We might find some medals...

155
00:13:52,602 --> 00:13:54,602
- Look, ammo.
- Awesome.

156
00:13:55,768 --> 00:14:00,127
- So? See? Didn't we get lucky? 
- We really can, when we want to.

157
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:01,115
Give me.

158
00:14:01,848 --> 00:14:03,132
We can.

159
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:04,964
For the bag!

160
00:14:06,288 --> 00:14:07,720
to make sure it's not the last one.

161
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:21,164
To kill you for the dreadlocks?

162
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,242
Huh?

163
00:14:27,168 --> 00:14:28,986
I'm going to stick this spoon in your eye.

164
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,804
Just make it quick, no suffering.

165
00:14:32,888 --> 00:14:34,878
Come'n, don't be scared. Joke.

166
00:14:35,448 --> 00:14:38,883
- Let's go shoot some cans instead
- Let's go!

167
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:53,769
- How is it?
- Nice! Turn it towards me.

168
00:14:53,803 --> 00:14:55,198
Now I'll make my headshot.

169
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:00,675
Loaded?

170
00:15:00,727 --> 00:15:03,293
- What happened?! Huh?
- Are you a completed idiot? Get out of here!

171
00:15:03,328 --> 00:15:07,239
- What do you want, I don't get it?
- Get off me! Don't shoot if you don't want to.
- Don't do that!

172
00:15:10,566 --> 00:15:12,533
- Borman!
- Shut up.

173
00:15:12,568 --> 00:15:15,447
- Borman!
- What? You finally got a voice?
- Borman!

174
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:16,960
Shut up Chug. You hear me? 

175
00:15:23,006 --> 00:15:24,359
What?

176
00:15:25,086 --> 00:15:27,446
- Think before you do, dumbass.
- What did I do?

177
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:28,771
Guys!

178
00:15:28,806 --> 00:15:32,402
- Borman, aborigines are coming.
- Guys!
- What the hell.

179
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:40,174
There you are, I was looking for you in the woods.

180
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:44,687
- Hey, grandma, are you sure you're looking for us?
- You, darlings, who else?

181
00:15:44,722 --> 00:15:48,397
Here, I brought you some milk,
just like I promised yesterday.

182
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:52,247
- I think she's confusing us with Ashot's guys
- I'm curious, what they told her.

183
00:15:52,282 --> 00:15:53,932
You are probably tired.

184
00:15:53,968 --> 00:15:56,065
- Milk restores energy.
- Thank you.

185
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,162
- Huh?
- Come on.
- We should pay for it.

186
00:15:58,845 --> 00:16:01,683
Grandma, how much do we owe you? 

187
00:16:01,718 --> 00:16:04,517
What are you saying, "owe"!

188
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:08,721
You think I don't know what
you're doing here.

189
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:13,162
It'd be good to bury the soldiers.

190
00:16:13,649 --> 00:16:17,693
- I wanted to ask you.
- Ask, mother, ask anything you want.

191
00:16:17,728 --> 00:16:21,247
- Would you like us to bring you some firewood,
or Chuha can milk your goat. 
- No, that's not necessary.

192
00:16:21,282 --> 00:16:23,333
- I have firewood.
- Calm down

193
00:16:23,367 --> 00:16:27,599
My son disappeared here in summer of 1942.

194
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:31,012
Red Army soldier: Dmitry Sokolov.

195
00:16:31,048 --> 00:16:34,322
- That's not easy
- Yes.
- Only if there are any documents left.

196
00:16:35,006 --> 00:16:40,648
He had a cigarette case with engraving
"For devotion to revolution".

197
00:16:40,682 --> 00:16:43,171
His grandfather gave it to him before the war

198
00:16:43,206 --> 00:16:46,788
- Silver?
- It's shiny with red stone in the center.

199
00:16:46,822 --> 00:16:50,366
- Don't worry grandma, now we'll find it for sure
- Yes we'll find it.
- We'll find it.

200
00:16:50,402 --> 00:16:51,252
We'll find it for sure

201
00:16:51,287 --> 00:16:54,248
- Thank you, may God watch over you.
- We'll certainly do our best.
- Don't forget to leave us your address, grandma...
196
00:16:35,283 --> 00:16:36,928
...so we know for sure
where to bring it. 

202
00:16:55,962 --> 00:16:57,245
Take some rest

203
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:02,773
- It's hot
- Yes

204
00:17:02,808 --> 00:17:04,559
Hot. Hot. Very hot.

205
00:17:05,327 --> 00:17:08,762
- There is a lake close by.
- Yep.

206
00:17:08,806 --> 00:17:11,368
It's good, clean.

207
00:17:13,008 --> 00:17:15,227
- Take a swim, enjoy.
- We will, grandma.

208
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:17,412
- We will, grandma.
- Thanks, grandma

209
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:20,366
- We will, grandma.
- Thank you boys. 
- Thanks grandma. 

210
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,959
Thank you

211
00:17:34,287 --> 00:17:35,517
Let me.

212
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:37,436
There!

213
00:17:38,248 --> 00:17:40,237
Sorry bro.

214
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:08,526
Look, -"Filatov Sergey Ivanovich, 
born in 1917, private. Not in the Party"

215
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,132
Does he have an exact name like you? 

216
00:18:10,168 --> 00:18:14,764
Wait! This is .. that's my photo! 

217
00:18:18,446 --> 00:18:20,597
No way? Let me see

218
00:18:22,566 --> 00:18:23,885
Wow!

219
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:25,438
Yes, that' you.

220
00:18:26,927 --> 00:18:30,126
" Andrei Alex..." That's you - Smirnov

221
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:33,964
Huh?

222
00:18:35,207 --> 00:18:36,607
That's right. that's me

223
00:18:38,006 --> 00:18:41,447
"Vasilyev Oleg Petrovich" 
Cherep, that's you!

224
00:18:41,482 --> 00:18:43,084
Right! Let me look.

225
00:18:47,288 --> 00:18:48,766
I'm not getting it.

226
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:54,206
What about me?

227
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:05,719
"Beroev Vitaly Semenovich"
Let me see if I got it right. Cherep 
almost put a hole in his own skull?

228
00:19:07,048 --> 00:19:09,127
Where did you buy that vodka, shitface?

229
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:10,813
In the village, in a kiosk.

230
00:19:10,848 --> 00:19:13,920
Didn't I ask you not to buy anywhere
but at the store?  Who knows what's in it?

231
00:19:14,367 --> 00:19:16,643
Now, because of this imbecile
we're stuffed with Metil spirit

232
00:19:17,126 --> 00:19:20,408
Come on, Borman, no Metil here,
good vodka, right? 

233
00:19:20,441 --> 00:19:22,205
- Really good.
- Good.
- Good vodka.

234
00:19:27,806 --> 00:19:29,012
It's hallucinations.

235
00:19:29,047 --> 00:19:31,117
hallucinations? What about this?!
Also hallucinations?!

236
00:19:31,288 --> 00:19:33,013
- Hallucinations?!
- Lets go to the lake. That's it! 

237
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:36,407
- Maybe we should sober up a bit first...
- Bring some books .. maybe we'll figure
out if its really hallucinations

238
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:37,807
...from the cold water.

239
00:19:38,327 --> 00:19:41,079
And... so... we going to leave
everything here as is?

240
00:19:41,488 --> 00:19:42,557
Hey!

241
00:19:56,606 --> 00:19:58,006
Dammit!

242
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:06,962
Let's not drown each other, 
I swim just like a stone.

243
00:20:50,448 --> 00:20:51,960
What the hell!!

244
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:14,886
What's this?!

245
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:16,807
Have you gone crazy?!

246
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:18,684
Let's get out of here!

247
00:21:20,726 --> 00:21:22,001
Hey!

248
00:21:26,807 --> 00:21:28,452
Fireworks, maybe!

249
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,159
They're celebrating some 'New Year'!

250
00:21:30,207 --> 00:21:31,436
Maybe military training?

251
00:21:34,007 --> 00:21:36,805
No, it's not training!
Not fireworks!

252
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,924
Where are these explosions from?!

253
00:21:42,728 --> 00:21:43,796
MAMA!

254
00:21:45,128 --> 00:21:46,241
No shit!

255
00:21:47,366 --> 00:21:51,407
Borman, what the hell is this?!

256
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:02,004
Freeze! Or I'll shoot!

257
00:22:03,446 --> 00:22:05,201
Hands up!!!

258
00:22:05,248 --> 00:22:07,044
Let go off me, Bitch!

259
00:22:08,688 --> 00:22:09,722
Let go, hurts!

260
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:12,088
We're friendlies!

261
00:22:13,485 --> 00:22:15,239
Have you gone mad completely?!

262
00:22:15,849 --> 00:22:16,915
Get up!

263
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,686
I think they are friendlies.

264
00:22:27,048 --> 00:22:30,484
Comrade corporal, they are naked as angels.

265
00:22:30,725 --> 00:22:33,007
Where did you leave your pants, idiots?

266
00:22:33,042 --> 00:22:34,491
We were swimming in the lake.

267
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:38,488
- Swimming?
- Yes, swimming. Didn't you get that the 1st time?

268
00:22:38,521 --> 00:22:39,891
Get who?

269
00:22:39,926 --> 00:22:42,488
What? you don't understand Russian?
Maybe you'd like it in Chinese?

270
00:22:42,522 --> 00:22:44,237
So, you understand Chinese?

271
00:22:46,248 --> 00:22:48,249
Comrade corporal, may I?

272
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:49,252
No!

273
00:22:49,288 --> 00:22:51,689
You will speak when being spoken to.

274
00:22:51,722 --> 00:22:53,092
- Elin.
- Here!

275
00:22:53,127 --> 00:22:56,686
Go to the lake, check everything! 
Clothes, documents, firearms. 

276
00:22:56,721 --> 00:22:59,406
Make it fast, but quiet.

277
00:22:59,441 --> 00:23:00,122
Roger that!

278
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:06,008
So, you were escaping the Germans 
through the lake?

279
00:23:06,043 --> 00:23:09,128
escaping the Germans 
through the lake. Yes

280
00:23:09,161 --> 00:23:10,402
Fine.

281
00:23:11,247 --> 00:23:13,601
Get up. Let's go.

282
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:27,722
Cover your swastika tatoo. If anyone sees it
we'll be shot without a trial.

283
00:23:32,927 --> 00:23:34,327
Take your watch off.

284
00:23:35,807 --> 00:23:39,118
Shoot those defectors.

285
00:23:39,368 --> 00:23:41,307
What do you mean "shoot"!

286
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:43,213
You're a reasonable, soviet citizen!

287
00:23:43,248 --> 00:23:48,928
If I may, comrade lieutenant major,
It may seem completely delirious 
but we're your descendant.

288
00:23:48,963 --> 00:23:49,881
Yes, we're from the future.

289
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:54,120
2nd World War is long over.

290
00:23:54,407 --> 00:23:57,574
- Very long ago.
- And? Did we win?

291
00:23:57,607 --> 00:24:00,918
- Yes.
- Yes, we won, just like we wanted.

292
00:24:03,246 --> 00:24:05,053
May I, comrade Political Advisor?

293
00:24:05,088 --> 00:24:08,686
There was a lot of bombing,
they could be contused.

294
00:24:08,722 --> 00:24:10,853
So, all together?

295
00:24:10,889 --> 00:24:13,143
As we can see, that maybe possible

296
00:24:13,178 --> 00:24:15,402
comrade lieutenant major, may I?

297
00:24:15,648 --> 00:24:18,956
- Here, I found their documents.
- Where the hell were you!

298
00:24:25,607 --> 00:24:29,693
Yes, 12th division, 131st unit.

299
00:24:29,726 --> 00:24:34,208
comrade Political Advisor, that' right
131st was trying to make it out through
the German ring.

300
00:24:34,242 --> 00:24:37,440
Looks like these are the only survivors.

301
00:24:39,085 --> 00:24:42,762
The whole unit died in front of their eyes, 
clouded their minds.

302
00:24:43,767 --> 00:24:45,837
Well, happens

303
00:24:47,047 --> 00:24:50,484
Ok chief, let's decide what to do.

304
00:24:50,885 --> 00:24:52,527
with the contused.

305
00:24:54,406 --> 00:24:56,172
SPEAKER: Russian soldiers!

306
00:24:56,208 --> 00:25:01,213
(It's been 2 years since your country
is in this giant war.) 

307
00:25:01,245 --> 00:25:06,848
(This war was started by Stalin and his
Jewish gang from Kremlin!)

308
00:25:06,883 --> 00:25:11,732
(It's a way of Jews nationals fighting for global revolution)

309
00:25:11,767 --> 00:25:17,807
(to implement their dream of enslaving nations
just like they enslaved you.)

310
00:25:17,841 --> 00:25:25,395
SPEAKING GERMAN

311
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:48,126
So, Borman, are you going to feed us bullshit
that we are all hallucinating?

312
00:25:48,162 --> 00:25:49,486
Maybe we're asleep and it's a dream?

313
00:25:49,523 --> 00:25:50,887
Right, all of us, together!

314
00:25:51,126 --> 00:25:55,998
Look, we got a situation, we're in the past.

315
00:25:56,487 --> 00:25:58,238
What do you mean "Past" ?!

316
00:25:58,325 --> 00:26:01,133
Yes. The real, heroic, PAST!

317
00:26:01,168 --> 00:26:05,929
Wait, let me get this right, 
are we all going to die here?

318
00:26:05,962 --> 00:26:06,917
Finally it sunk in.

319
00:26:09,688 --> 00:26:11,211
I want to go home.

320
00:26:11,246 --> 00:26:14,634
Home - is good. Just too early.

321
00:26:17,567 --> 00:26:18,920
Get dressed.

322
00:26:19,608 --> 00:26:20,597
Here brother.

323
00:26:21,126 --> 00:26:21,934
Here, take it

324
00:26:21,969 --> 00:26:24,728
Really, you were really lucky today

325
00:26:24,761 --> 00:26:27,401
Commander was in a good mood.
Otherwise...

326
00:26:27,448 --> 00:26:28,276
Otherwise what?

327
00:26:29,726 --> 00:26:31,399
Otherwise it would have been otherwise.

328
00:26:32,287 --> 00:26:35,486
Comrade Corporal, many defectors?

329
00:26:35,521 --> 00:26:38,047
Happens. They run, get caught and shot.

330
00:26:38,728 --> 00:26:40,053
What did you think?

331
00:26:40,088 --> 00:26:43,448
In War you can run only 1 way, forward

332
00:26:43,483 --> 00:26:45,244
Then you might make it through alive.

333
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:49,324
Look, not bad guys, real "Armani".

334
00:26:49,928 --> 00:26:51,918
- Awesome outfit.
- What did you say?

335
00:26:52,447 --> 00:26:55,527
I said very good clothes, 
Comrade Corporal.

336
00:26:55,562 --> 00:26:57,061
Very good clothes.

337
00:26:57,096 --> 00:26:58,557
Why, did you wear something different?

338
00:26:59,725 --> 00:27:01,967
- Just like Huan's Sombrero.
- Look in the mirror, assface

339
00:27:02,002 --> 00:27:03,572
When are you all finally going to shut up!

340
00:27:03,607 --> 00:27:05,915
Do you think you're still in charge?
There, we have a new commander now

341
00:27:08,048 --> 00:27:10,685
- Greeting, comrade lieutenant major!
- Good soldier.

342
00:27:11,365 --> 00:27:13,410
- Where are you from?
- From St.Petersburg.

343
00:27:13,447 --> 00:27:15,961
- We're all from St.Petersburg.
- No way! where from?

344
00:27:16,568 --> 00:27:18,329
I'm from "Petrogradskaya" 
and these are from "Vaska"

345
00:27:18,361 --> 00:27:19,362
And I'm from "Petrogradskaya".

346
00:27:19,887 --> 00:27:21,728
- And where exactly did you live?
- On "Large Posad".

347
00:27:21,762 --> 00:27:23,081
And I'm from "Large Posad"!

348
00:27:23,448 --> 00:27:25,887
- Which building?
- 9.

349
00:27:25,923 --> 00:27:26,922
I'm from the 12th.

350
00:27:27,488 --> 00:27:28,813
Look at that!

351
00:27:28,848 --> 00:27:31,771
- What school did you go to?
- To 23rd.
- Me too!

352
00:27:31,806 --> 00:27:34,846
- Did you go to the boxing class?
- Of course! from my 5th year.

353
00:27:34,881 --> 00:27:36,485
- For real!
- Yep.

354
00:27:37,008 --> 00:27:38,572
- Who was your coach?
- Petrovich.

355
00:27:38,606 --> 00:27:43,287
Petrovich? Listen, is he still
running to pick up fresh paper
in the mornings?

356
00:27:43,322 --> 00:27:46,565
Not sure about papers, but he
watches the news on TV in the teacher's room.

357
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:48,884
What the heck is "TV"?

358
00:27:49,527 --> 00:27:52,646
Can you imagine, their school paper 
is called "TV".

359
00:27:52,681 --> 00:27:53,875
Yep.

360
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:55,565
Strange name.

361
00:27:56,248 --> 00:27:59,157
- What do you think, Emelyanov?
- "TV"...

362
00:28:00,486 --> 00:28:02,717
- "TV".
- I didn't even know there was such a word.

363
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:11,676
Do you really want to know today's date?

364
00:28:13,166 --> 00:28:14,213
Well?

365
00:28:14,248 --> 00:28:17,689
August 19th, 1942

366
00:28:17,723 --> 00:28:18,677
Oh-oh..

367
00:28:23,087 --> 00:28:27,444
We got here through the lake,
so the only way out of here is
through that lake.

368
00:28:27,928 --> 00:28:30,333
We won't make it back during the day, we'll get shot

369
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:33,206
So, stick around and don't move till dark

370
00:28:33,241 --> 00:28:35,767
- Yes.
- Only after dark we'll go to the lake

371
00:28:35,802 --> 00:28:37,253
- Here they are
- some bullshit

372
00:28:37,288 --> 00:28:41,647
Common disorientation. But Nina, 
please check well, maybe they are faking it

373
00:28:41,682 --> 00:28:46,197
Let me introduce our nurse, sergeant major Nina Polyakova

374
00:28:48,367 --> 00:28:50,121
I'll be close by

375
00:28:51,367 --> 00:28:53,518
- Great!
- Let me help you

376
00:28:57,289 --> 00:29:01,408
So? What happened with you, boys? contused?

377
00:29:01,442 --> 00:29:03,238
- Contused.
- Got it.
- Down!!!

378
00:29:03,328 --> 00:29:04,522
Get down!

379
00:29:08,328 --> 00:29:09,726
Stay down!

380
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:30,506
Idiot, go take cover!

381
00:29:30,542 --> 00:29:32,509
- Nurse!
- I'm here!

382
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,478
Run-run-run-run!

383
00:29:40,886 --> 00:29:42,373
Motherf****, it started!

384
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:46,167
- What started?
- Airstrike.

385
00:29:46,202 --> 00:29:47,963
Next attack.

386
00:29:50,007 --> 00:29:52,522
- Who? Germans?
- Who else?

387
00:29:58,487 --> 00:30:00,954
Grab a rifle from the dead and wounded!!! 

388
00:30:24,246 --> 00:30:26,237
Look.

389
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:36,662
In position!

390
00:30:36,696 --> 00:30:39,514
Get ready to fire!

391
00:30:42,606 --> 00:30:45,644
Get ready to defend!

392
00:30:45,887 --> 00:30:48,925
Guys, tanks!
Grab grenades!

393
00:30:59,286 --> 00:31:02,324
Dammit! Infantry is behind the tanks.

394
00:31:07,688 --> 00:31:14,364
Fire at people, aim at waist, single, shoot!

395
00:31:49,087 --> 00:31:50,200
Bastard!

396
00:32:02,567 --> 00:32:03,919
- Manyakin!
- Here.

397
00:32:04,447 --> 00:32:06,678
Come on, son, try it.

398
00:32:23,927 --> 00:32:25,359
There Bitch!

399
00:33:17,448 --> 00:33:18,845
I'll help

400
00:33:19,448 --> 00:33:22,325
- Is he alive?
- Can you pull faster?

401
00:33:24,287 --> 00:33:25,277
A-aa!

402
00:33:26,648 --> 00:33:28,080
Let me see.

403
00:33:29,606 --> 00:33:31,678
You'll live. Come'n pull!

404
00:33:32,127 --> 00:33:35,088
but maybe.. clean, disinfect, stitches, bandage?

405
00:33:35,122 --> 00:33:36,918
Maybe I should give you a Tit too?!
Go faster!

406
00:33:40,969 --> 00:33:42,240
Hang in there.

407
00:33:42,607 --> 00:33:46,167
- Why are you smiling?
- it's .. from all the commotion. 
Sorry

408
00:33:46,203 --> 00:33:48,318
I like you, that's why I'm smiling.

409
00:33:48,354 --> 00:33:50,437
You sure picked the right time to hit on a girl.

410
00:33:51,407 --> 00:33:53,367
- Come on boys!
- Come on.
- Grab.

411
00:33:53,402 --> 00:33:55,119
He's alive.

412
00:34:01,647 --> 00:34:02,797
Dammit...

413
00:34:03,127 --> 00:34:03,958
Give me a round.

414
00:34:04,848 --> 00:34:06,404
Round! - I said!

415
00:34:08,126 --> 00:34:10,161
Give me a round, motherfucker!

416
00:34:17,686 --> 00:34:20,997
Just a little bit, little bit more. 

417
00:34:25,566 --> 00:34:29,845
Well?! Did you .. shit your pants!

418
00:34:42,207 --> 00:34:43,721
Mother.

419
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:49,117
- Did you get enough, bastards!
- YEEEEEES!!!

420
00:34:51,007 --> 00:34:54,158
- Yes!!!
- Yes!!!

421
00:35:00,528 --> 00:35:02,039
I think the moment was appropriate.

422
00:35:02,806 --> 00:35:03,760
(SHOUTING: Yes!!!)

423
00:35:07,166 --> 00:35:08,999
Where are we going to spend the night?

424
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,357
- Comrade corporal!
- Quiet.

425
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:20,806
- There, give Petrovich some more.
- There is enough for everyone.

426
00:35:20,841 --> 00:35:23,195
So, you're after nurses now?

427
00:35:23,767 --> 00:35:25,439
looks like I'm not the only one.

428
00:35:26,128 --> 00:35:28,467
Are you asking for it?
Want to be smudged all over these trenches?

429
00:35:28,503 --> 00:35:30,807
We shouldn't be like that here, Borman
Where is your comradeship

430
00:35:30,843 --> 00:35:31,876
Did you just call me Borman?

431
00:35:31,927 --> 00:35:35,806
- Why did you call me Borman?!
- My fault, Sergey Nikolaevich.
- Quiet!

432
00:35:36,646 --> 00:35:38,571
- Get out of here.
- Got it.

433
00:35:38,605 --> 00:35:40,837
Little to the right, just like that.

434
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:50,101
(SINGING: I'll give you, my dear, a hand crafted handkerchief) 

435
00:35:50,136 --> 00:35:56,717
(Show it to everybody
But don't tell them about our Love)

436
00:36:07,408 --> 00:36:09,873
I'm going to go dry it

437
00:36:12,766 --> 00:36:14,172
Well, what do you want?

438
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,641
I'm entitled to the change of bandage.

439
00:36:19,885 --> 00:36:21,445
Even brought some flowers.

440
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,840
Hang in there sweetie.

441
00:36:31,886 --> 00:36:33,922
- Thank you.
- Quiet, quiet.

442
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:40,395
Jesus! Get out of here, we're short of
bandages, your scratch can be treated
with a little disinfectant.

443
00:36:41,247 --> 00:36:44,523
- And how long have you been fighting?
- Longer than you, that's for sure.

444
00:36:45,087 --> 00:36:49,444
- How long do you think I've been fighting?
- Why would I even think about that?
I have plenty of my own thoughts.

445
00:36:52,527 --> 00:36:54,597
Get out of here, poor bastard.

446
00:36:57,607 --> 00:36:58,597
Get out.

447
00:36:59,569 --> 00:37:00,885
Please forgive me, Nina.

448
00:37:02,887 --> 00:37:05,532
And.. I'm very interested to know 
what a girl is thinking of as ...

449
00:37:05,567 --> 00:37:11,608
About the usual: when the war is over,
and the happy life we're going to have

450
00:37:11,642 --> 00:37:14,644
Well, we'll win the war, 
I guarantee you that.

451
00:37:16,246 --> 00:37:19,763
I can't promise the happy life though

452
00:37:21,127 --> 00:37:22,241
Unfortunately

453
00:37:23,687 --> 00:37:24,837
Interesting.

454
00:37:25,929 --> 00:37:27,963
What else do you guarantee?

455
00:37:28,566 --> 00:37:32,241
Cities will be rebuilt, skyscrapers in Moscow

456
00:37:32,687 --> 00:37:36,601
- Skyscrapers?
- Will fly to space.

457
00:37:37,366 --> 00:37:39,436
Fly to space?

458
00:37:43,448 --> 00:37:46,043
(OUTSIDE: Trucks are here! Load up the wounded!)

459
00:37:47,128 --> 00:37:51,039
Hold on a little longer, they'll operate soon,
it'll be ok.

460
00:37:53,248 --> 00:37:55,760
Careful. See that he doesn't get shaken up
along the way.

461
00:37:57,487 --> 00:37:58,555
That's about it.

462
00:38:01,888 --> 00:38:04,606
Maria, where do I take it?

463
00:38:14,409 --> 00:38:16,046
Who is this?

464
00:38:19,606 --> 00:38:22,963
Special Unit. I think he's here after us

465
00:38:51,207 --> 00:38:57,408
Listen, Cherep, soldiers talk about 
advancing soon, we got to take off 
as soon as possible.

466
00:38:57,443 --> 00:39:00,000
What about Motherland?
Who's going to defend Motherland?

467
00:39:00,045 --> 00:39:03,606
We're as good defenders as a grenade made out of turd.

468
00:39:03,642 --> 00:39:04,597
Watch it, bro.

469
00:39:04,805 --> 00:39:09,289
Got to go to the lake, if we get lucky
we'll come out in our happy future

470
00:39:09,323 --> 00:39:10,959
That is if we get really lucky.

471
00:39:14,287 --> 00:39:16,370
On the other hand, it'd be better
you get wacked here.

472
00:39:16,405 --> 00:39:18,930
It'd be better if you get wacked, 
and I'll live a little longer. Got that?

473
00:39:18,962 --> 00:39:22,166
And not in this screwed up past, but in my future

474
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:23,652
Because I find it more interesting.

475
00:39:23,688 --> 00:39:25,492
To yell "Hi Hitler!" and to kill poor immigrants?

476
00:39:25,528 --> 00:39:29,367
- Piss off!
- So you'll go to jail and eat shit.

477
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:31,126
Only you'll go there before me!

478
00:39:31,162 --> 00:39:32,772
And why is that?

479
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:35,114
Very simple, you'll be a junkie addict with your black Rap music

480
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:36,598
Dumbass

481
00:39:37,368 --> 00:39:39,723
- Who's dumbass?
- Yes. You're dumbass.

482
00:39:40,089 --> 00:39:40,836
Your.

483
00:39:49,328 --> 00:39:51,840
Quit that!

484
00:39:57,608 --> 00:39:59,643
Attention!

485
00:40:00,008 --> 00:40:03,318
Look. Attention.

486
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:09,242
If you hate each other so much, 
how did you fight that you survived?

487
00:40:09,847 --> 00:40:12,442
It's called - undermining of military capacity

488
00:40:12,607 --> 00:40:16,007
of a military unit in combat,

489
00:40:16,043 --> 00:40:17,452
another words - treason.

490
00:40:17,487 --> 00:40:20,126
- Treason of what?
- Motherland.

491
00:40:21,246 --> 00:40:23,635
One more time, you'll be court-martialed.

492
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:37,403
Funny, digged out over there, digging in over here

493
00:40:38,128 --> 00:40:40,684
Startuk, do you have a heart?

494
00:40:41,367 --> 00:40:42,719
Got to be humane

495
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:46,403
Most important for us is not to end up here instead of them

496
00:40:49,966 --> 00:40:52,492
Got to do something, or I'll go crazy

497
00:40:52,526 --> 00:40:57,922
I beg you, calm down. 
When it gets dark we'll go to the lake.

498
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:17,172
God, please remember the names of our fallen.

499
00:41:17,206 --> 00:41:20,413
And calm their souls in the light of Your face

500
00:41:20,448 --> 00:41:25,238
In the name of the Father, Son and the Holly Spirit
today, before and forever. Amin

501
00:41:51,127 --> 00:41:54,367
What's up, infantry, what news 
do you want to hear first: good or bad?

502
00:41:54,401 --> 00:41:55,845
Bad.

503
00:41:58,086 --> 00:41:59,235


504
00:42:00,087 --> 00:42:01,314
Well, there is no booze anywhere.

505
00:42:01,606 --> 00:42:02,959
And the bad?

506
00:42:04,088 --> 00:42:07,205
Your Nina is giving a mind blowing 
concert by the kitchen.

507
00:42:30,247 --> 00:42:31,760
- Let me sit
- Get out, let me sit.

508
00:42:36,726 --> 00:42:44,981
"Thanks for everything, kind friend,
For that you were a true friend"

509
00:42:45,016 --> 00:42:53,240
"For field of honey grass
For tiny moon above the field"

510
00:42:53,447 --> 00:43:01,718
"For field of honey grass
For tiny moon above the field"

511
00:43:04,647 --> 00:43:07,648
Why are you so sad?
Your vocals aren't worth shit today?

512
00:43:07,682 --> 00:43:09,204
Well, I like it.

513
00:43:10,008 --> 00:43:18,086
- "For that village behind the river..."
- It'd be nice to have a guitar here.
- "...Where I walked, forget about tiredness..."

514
00:43:18,121 --> 00:43:26,132
"For feelings that just became another line"
- Come on, show them!
"For lines that spanned from a feeling"

515
00:43:26,167 --> 00:43:30,366
"For feelings that just became another line"
- Quiet! Can't hear.
- Sorry, comrade, sorry.

516
00:43:30,403 --> 00:43:34,483
"For feelings that just became another line"
- Excuse me, may I borrow the guitar? Please?

517
00:43:42,646 --> 00:43:50,864
"For your love that I needed more than bread"

518
00:43:50,899 --> 00:43:59,082
"For me, imagining you in a way you weren't"

519
00:43:59,489 --> 00:44:07,757
"For me, imagining you in a way you weren't"

520
00:44:17,727 --> 00:44:19,524
"He'll show them now"

521
00:44:22,286 --> 00:44:24,093
I'm going to show you now!  All quiet ! 

522
00:44:24,128 --> 00:44:27,243
Listen comrade, why are you so touchy?

523
00:45:24,848 --> 00:45:27,125
- Excellent!
- That's how it's done!

524
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:28,641
Great! Excellent!

525
00:45:31,368 --> 00:45:32,403
Come on!

526
00:45:33,606 --> 00:45:35,042
Excellent!

527
00:45:38,888 --> 00:45:40,494
- Good for you.
- Well, Excellent.

528
00:45:40,528 --> 00:45:42,246
- Come on, one more time!
- May I walk you back?

529
00:45:42,526 --> 00:45:44,132
Well, ok.

530
00:45:44,165 --> 00:45:46,123
Can you do something like that?

531
00:45:56,367 --> 00:45:58,756
Excuse me, may I join you?

532
00:45:59,368 --> 00:46:01,596
- Why aren't you sleeping?
- Can't.

533
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:07,647
It's SO quiet.
By the way, that's extremely rare.

534
00:46:07,682 --> 00:46:12,248
Nina.. I’m amazed by you and your voice

535
00:46:12,283 --> 00:46:13,725
What?

536
00:46:14,884 --> 00:46:16,401
- Oh come on.
- You sang...

537
00:46:17,046 --> 00:46:18,879
...as if you're a real singer.

538
00:46:19,407 --> 00:46:21,764
oh come on, artist.

539
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:24,122
You don't have to be shy

540
00:46:24,647 --> 00:46:27,400
You win over any singer, hands down.

541
00:46:28,407 --> 00:46:30,682
You have a soul...

542
00:46:31,768 --> 00:46:32,804
heart.

543
00:46:36,529 --> 00:46:37,359
Thank you.

544
00:46:41,405 --> 00:46:43,238
Your hand smells so...

545
00:46:44,008 --> 00:46:45,042
How?

546
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:51,806
Here with soap, here with medicine

547
00:46:52,568 --> 00:46:53,852
Enough.

548
00:46:53,888 --> 00:46:57,766
Thinks he found a madam, kissing hands. 
Get out before you get it.

549
00:46:59,009 --> 00:47:01,452
- Nina...
- Get out of here.

550
00:47:01,487 --> 00:47:05,445
- ...that time we were running in the field...
- Did you hear what I said?

551
00:47:05,527 --> 00:47:09,122
... everything was exploding around, bullets flying...

552
00:47:13,246 --> 00:47:15,398
Nina, what's going on?

553
00:47:15,646 --> 00:47:17,572
Nina, what's this?

554
00:47:17,607 --> 00:47:21,601
- Sleep.
- Nothing. 
- Packing bandages.

555
00:47:25,727 --> 00:47:28,606
Where the hell is he? 
We had an agreement.

556
00:47:28,641 --> 00:47:30,532
It's the time to go the lake.

557
00:47:30,568 --> 00:47:32,292
You think it fast and easy to charm a lady?

558
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:35,166
Chuha, it's difficult and unthankful labor

559
00:47:35,203 --> 00:47:36,155
I guess it is hard for some hardheads.

560
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:38,326
Is he with that nurse?

561
00:47:39,526 --> 00:47:41,966
Yes, they are having huge sex
in a little forest.

562
00:47:42,001 --> 00:47:42,955
Bastard.

563
00:47:43,088 --> 00:47:44,679
- Can't sleep?
- Waiting for you.

564
00:47:45,247 --> 00:47:48,159
So, did you do it?
Did you?

565
00:47:49,047 --> 00:47:50,400
Did you?

566
00:47:51,048 --> 00:47:52,052
Did you!

567
00:47:52,087 --> 00:47:54,007
Enough, sort it out later, 
we have to go to the lake.

568
00:47:54,044 --> 00:47:54,837
Let's go

569
00:47:55,285 --> 00:47:58,039
- Why are you taking the rifle?
- Without it we're defectors.

570
00:47:58,607 --> 00:48:00,519
Chuha, sort it out later.

571
00:48:21,487 --> 00:48:24,843
Shit, it's so cold!
It was so much warmer then.

572
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:27,566
Pray to god to make it warm.

573
00:48:27,602 --> 00:48:28,638
Dive!

574
00:48:55,129 --> 00:48:57,786
Damn, cold, freezing my legs.

575
00:48:57,823 --> 00:49:00,412
Maybe we're home already?
In our time.

576
00:49:00,446 --> 00:49:03,689
No, the water would have been warm. 
Now it's cold

577
00:49:03,722 --> 00:49:06,008
So, are we going to swim till we drown?

578
00:49:06,043 --> 00:49:08,331
- How am I supposed to know?
- Guys!

579
00:49:08,366 --> 00:49:12,681
Guys! How long are you going to swim,
we're getting cold here waiting for you.

580
00:49:13,168 --> 00:49:17,246
- What the hell?!
- Damn, he's been watching us!
- Turns out that way.

581
00:49:17,283 --> 00:49:19,290
Why are you so attracted to this lake?
As if it's a magnet

582
00:49:19,327 --> 00:49:22,876
- Not really.
- Just decided to go for a swim, comrade corporal.

583
00:49:23,366 --> 00:49:27,327
Right! I can hear from here your teeth drum.

584
00:49:27,362 --> 00:49:29,794
Neah, we're fine here.

585
00:49:31,287 --> 00:49:34,368
Out of the water!
I can hear your teeth grinding from here!

586
00:49:34,403 --> 00:49:36,928
Excellent water!
Absolutely wonderful!

587
00:49:48,645 --> 00:49:50,127
I want potato chips.

588
00:49:54,568 --> 00:49:56,647
How do we get out of here?

589
00:49:56,682 --> 00:49:58,692
Naturally, year after year..

590
00:49:58,727 --> 00:50:00,931
- Hey, dumbass
- What?
Maybe you'll finally shut up?

591
00:50:00,968 --> 00:50:03,727
Enough is enough. Now we have to stick together

592
00:50:03,764 --> 00:50:04,532
Why now?

593
00:50:04,569 --> 00:50:06,932
- We got here through the lake together, right?
- So?

594
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:10,411
The only way back is by doing it together.

595
00:50:10,446 --> 00:50:15,327
Last night we did dive in all
together, but I'm pretty sure
we're not home.

596
00:50:15,363 --> 00:50:17,124
I can't be here any longer!

597
00:50:17,888 --> 00:50:19,241
Boys!

598
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:27,093
- Tired? Relax.
- I think I opened the topic.

599
00:50:27,126 --> 00:50:29,526
- That's her.
- Have some cold milk.
- We're all here because of her.

600
00:50:29,561 --> 00:50:33,237
Mother, please forgive us!
Forgive us, mother!

601
00:50:33,847 --> 00:50:36,011
- Boys...
- What are you doing, mother?

602
00:50:36,046 --> 00:50:39,012
- Please, please forgive us!
- I beg you, please!

603
00:50:39,048 --> 00:50:42,127
- Forgive us!
- In the name of God!
- Forgive us, mother!

604
00:50:42,162 --> 00:50:44,203
- Please!
- Forgive us!
- Forgive us!

605
00:50:44,238 --> 00:50:46,213
- I beg you!
- What's with you, boys?

606
00:50:46,246 --> 00:50:49,212
Did you have a sun stroke or something?
Are you out of your mind?

607
00:50:49,247 --> 00:50:52,447
- What's with you
- Please boys...
- Hi, Avdotia.

608
00:50:52,482 --> 00:50:54,085
- Did you bring some milk?
- Yes...

609
00:50:56,486 --> 00:51:00,320
Ok. Don't pay attention. They are contused. Let's go...

610
00:51:00,407 --> 00:51:02,967
Look, they are not right in the head, what can we do... 

611
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:03,715
Mother..

612
00:51:04,246 --> 00:51:05,361
Mother..

613
00:51:05,608 --> 00:51:06,411
Mother!

614
00:51:06,445 --> 00:51:08,969
Wait. I'm not getting it.. 
is that her or not?

615
00:51:09,002 --> 00:51:10,240
No, that's her for sure.

616
00:51:10,328 --> 00:51:14,799
Wait guys, remember that grandma, with milk...
what did she tell us?

617
00:51:15,089 --> 00:51:17,252
Something about her son dying here.

618
00:51:17,287 --> 00:51:19,528
- Something about engraved cigarette case
- Yes.

619
00:51:19,563 --> 00:51:20,652
"To revolution" was on it.

620
00:51:20,688 --> 00:51:22,405
- What did you promise her?
- To find it.

621
00:51:24,766 --> 00:51:27,173
- I didn't like her at first sight! if only..
- Shut up!

622
00:51:27,207 --> 00:51:30,448
So, if we don't find her son, we are not 
getting out of here.

623
00:51:30,483 --> 00:51:32,133
Yep...

624
00:51:32,168 --> 00:51:33,987
Does anyone remember his name?

625
00:51:34,022 --> 00:51:35,805
I do - Sokolov. Dmitry Sokolov.

626
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:36,968
Yep. Infantry

627
00:51:37,002 --> 00:51:38,524
Yep.

628
00:51:41,126 --> 00:51:42,852
I'm here for you.

629
00:51:42,887 --> 00:51:45,721
Why do you look like beggars! Clean yourselves up!

630
00:51:46,326 --> 00:51:49,589
- Where are the rest?
- Working out punishment.

631
00:51:49,623 --> 00:51:52,845
In 5 min you all must be at the office.

632
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,365
- Cpt. Zhorin is waiting for you. 
- Special Unit.

633
00:51:55,399 --> 00:51:57,813
He is interested in your nightly swims.

634
00:51:57,845 --> 00:52:02,877
May I ...  ask a question,
do you remember a soldier: Dmitry Sokolov?

635
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:06,249
You're too late. 7 days ago their group did not return.

636
00:52:06,284 --> 00:52:08,132
There are 2 versions here.

637
00:52:08,167 --> 00:52:10,053
Are there any other Sokolov here?

638
00:52:10,088 --> 00:52:13,478
Not in our division. 
Ok guys, get yourselves in order. 

639
00:52:14,927 --> 00:52:16,966
- Hello.
- Hello.
- Hello.

640
00:52:17,002 --> 00:52:18,039
Hello

641
00:52:18,071 --> 00:52:19,075
Cutting to the point...

642
00:52:22,048 --> 00:52:24,647
- Did you go to the lake at night?
- Yes.

643
00:52:24,684 --> 00:52:26,400
Decided to go for a swim, wash up?

644
00:52:27,087 --> 00:52:31,087
You don't look stupid, at least most of you.

645
00:52:31,122 --> 00:52:33,760
Did you know about Germans being very close? 

646
00:52:34,248 --> 00:52:35,013
No

647
00:52:35,047 --> 00:52:39,165
Strange ignorance, - everybody knew except you.

648
00:52:44,688 --> 00:52:48,328
Tell me soldier, did you find anything suspicious on the way to the lake?

649
00:52:48,362 --> 00:52:49,891
Not really.

650
00:52:49,926 --> 00:52:51,892
any German posts by any chance?

651
00:52:51,927 --> 00:52:54,133
- It was too dark.
- Do you remember the way?

652
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:56,999
- It was dark. 
- We remember the way very well, Cpt.!

653
00:52:57,489 --> 00:52:59,604
What?... Hello.

654
00:53:00,126 --> 00:53:04,968
Had a nice chat? Turns out you're 
making wheat moonshine? Please do share. 

655
00:53:05,003 --> 00:53:07,166
Listen, Demin. It's true they say "idiots are lucky". 

656
00:53:07,201 --> 00:53:09,094
Made it to the lake and nothing.

657
00:53:09,129 --> 00:53:14,207
- And we have mine fields, barb wire, secrets...
- Oh!

658
00:53:14,243 --> 00:53:19,488
And these go through and nothing. 
As if they are really guests from the future.

659
00:53:19,521 --> 00:53:20,771
Smart guys. 

660
00:53:20,805 --> 00:53:22,808
Did you ask them about that .. future?

661
00:53:22,842 --> 00:53:24,691
Not yet.

662
00:53:24,727 --> 00:53:27,333
Soldiers, listen for your orders:

663
00:53:27,367 --> 00:53:34,169
tonight you'll go into German base, 
capture and bring back an officer 

664
00:53:34,201 --> 00:53:37,207
Leader of the group will be corporal Emelyanov.

665
00:53:37,242 --> 00:53:37,773
Roger that!

666
00:53:37,808 --> 00:53:43,325
Ok, when you come back with an officer, 

667
00:53:43,766 --> 00:53:46,486
then we'll talk about your past, present and your bright future.

668
00:53:46,521 --> 00:53:47,477
ID's..

669
00:53:48,689 --> 00:53:50,442
comrades.

670
00:54:12,527 --> 00:54:14,645
- Guys, do you remember our digging?
- Quiet!

671
00:54:15,247 --> 00:54:16,475
Shut up idiot!

672
00:54:17,246 --> 00:54:19,247
Did you see where he put our IDs?

673
00:54:19,281 --> 00:54:20,840
To that same safe.

674
00:54:22,809 --> 00:54:25,012
And the dude in leather coat. 

675
00:54:25,047 --> 00:54:27,448
So, it turns out we digged ourselves out.

676
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:29,333
And how many of us did we dig out?

677
00:54:29,368 --> 00:54:33,078
4 soldiers, officer in leather coat and a nurse.

678
00:54:35,129 --> 00:54:41,441
So check it out: IDs in the safe, 
our assignment, then advance.

679
00:54:50,128 --> 00:54:51,765
What time is it?

680
00:54:53,208 --> 00:54:54,525
6:42

681
00:54:58,407 --> 00:55:01,366
The time on that watch was 6:42

682
00:55:01,729 --> 00:55:02,331
Huh?

683
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:05,721
Ok, even if we accept that we digged ourselves out

684
00:55:06,488 --> 00:55:08,806
nobody will touch us until the attack for sure.

685
00:55:08,841 --> 00:55:10,811
But we have to escape before the attack.

686
00:55:10,846 --> 00:55:12,852
How will we know when the attack is?

687
00:55:12,885 --> 00:55:17,166
The attack in this region was at
6:00, August 23, 1942

688
00:55:17,489 --> 00:55:23,404
So we have left only ...

689
00:55:25,246 --> 00:55:26,805
62 hours

690
00:55:33,086 --> 00:55:34,360
Great!

691
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,885
No, we have to get out of here.

692
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,128
And what do you suggest?

693
00:55:40,161 --> 00:55:41,878
To fulfill our promise.

694
00:55:42,246 --> 00:55:44,556
We need to find that damn cigarette case.

695
00:55:45,206 --> 00:55:47,163
We need to find Sokolov.

696
00:55:47,528 --> 00:55:50,486
If he's scout, we have to go there and find his tracks.

697
00:55:50,522 --> 00:55:51,886
At least it's a lead.

698
00:56:10,487 --> 00:56:12,955
SPEAKING GERMAN

699
00:56:45,888 --> 00:56:46,761
Come on

700
00:56:47,248 --> 00:56:48,362
Let's go

701
00:56:57,248 --> 00:56:58,395
Ok

702
00:57:12,487 --> 00:57:13,524
Get down

703
00:57:14,807 --> 00:57:16,241
CANS NOISE

704
00:57:37,927 --> 00:57:39,405
What a bastard. 

705
00:57:47,967 --> 00:57:50,116
I'm listening, lieutenant major

706
00:57:51,326 --> 00:57:52,644
Can we talk in private?

707
00:57:57,849 --> 00:58:00,921
Nina, I... talked to the head office...

708
00:58:02,407 --> 00:58:04,965
They are transferring you to the
main hospital

709
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:08,927
So you can go pack right away

710
00:58:09,568 --> 00:58:13,958
I already told you "NO", lieutenant major.

711
00:58:16,329 --> 00:58:17,964
Why are you keep calling my rank.

712
00:58:18,645 --> 00:58:21,646
- I, by the way, have a name
- I don't need your name

713
00:58:21,681 --> 00:58:24,079
The attack is soon, that's what we have to think about

714
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:28,601
we don't need to

715
00:58:32,966 --> 00:58:34,720
And about the attack .. 

716
00:58:35,449 --> 00:58:38,598
Nothing to think about, we'll .. all of them

717
00:58:39,446 --> 00:58:40,765
how was it .. 

718
00:58:41,446 --> 00:58:42,643
"we'll do them all"

719
00:58:42,928 --> 00:58:44,155
What?

720
00:58:44,487 --> 00:58:46,483
another words: We'll win

721
00:58:46,519 --> 00:58:48,477
he's a "winner" now

722
00:58:50,088 --> 00:58:52,927
Nina, so will you transfer or not?

723
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:54,918
I've already arranged everything

724
00:58:56,126 --> 00:58:57,446
No. Sorry

725
00:58:58,206 --> 00:59:01,006
Go, the commander is waiting for you

726
00:59:02,487 --> 00:59:06,561
Lesha, please forgive me.

727
00:59:10,767 --> 00:59:12,121
Forgive me.

728
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:18,526
Here it is, damn foxhole 

729
00:59:19,046 --> 00:59:20,845
Here is the 2nd one

730
00:59:38,805 --> 00:59:41,957
SPEAKING GERMAN

731
01:00:31,489 --> 01:00:32,522
Come on faster!

732
01:00:37,766 --> 01:00:39,962
SPEAKING GERMAN

733
01:00:43,726 --> 01:00:45,958
- Tie hands.
- Yep.

734
01:00:56,887 --> 01:00:59,002
- I think the guys didn't make it
- Where?

735
01:01:27,047 --> 01:01:30,756
SHOTS FIRED AT THE FRONT LINE

736
01:01:33,329 --> 01:01:35,555
- Why aren't you sleeping?
- Can you hear?

737
01:01:37,647 --> 01:01:39,365
Still didn't make it

738
01:01:40,168 --> 01:01:41,566
They will

739
01:01:50,246 --> 01:01:51,971
Give me all grenades!

740
01:01:52,006 --> 01:01:54,267
- Drag him faster!
- What about you?

741
01:01:54,301 --> 01:01:56,525
I'll hold them as long as possible.

742
01:01:58,406 --> 01:02:03,526
- You'll get killed
- It's unknown yet. Why are you trying 
to have my funeral so soon?

743
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,881
Do you need a special invitation?

744
01:02:07,129 --> 01:02:09,082
Fulfill your orders! Go!

745
01:02:09,847 --> 01:02:13,609
Filatov, when does this war end?

746
01:02:13,643 --> 01:02:16,121
may 9, 1945

747
01:02:20,165 --> 01:02:21,998
I can't believe we'll make it. 

748
01:02:27,687 --> 01:02:28,802
Leave.

749
01:02:30,286 --> 01:02:31,641
Go! 

750
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:52,806
- Is he dead?
- Why are you even asking.

751
01:03:52,842 --> 01:03:55,239
Go. Faster.

752
01:03:57,966 --> 01:04:00,607
- Remember the way?
- Yes, we do
- I do too.

753
01:04:30,047 --> 01:04:33,812
Damn rags, my feet hurt

754
01:04:33,849 --> 01:04:37,078
- This was a successful mission. 
- Except we didn't find Sokolov.

755
01:04:38,129 --> 01:04:41,757
- Nope. Oleg, frisk him.
- Yep.

756
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:08,087
Here is your front line, show me your division.

757
01:05:08,121 --> 01:05:09,132
Show me.

758
01:05:09,167 --> 01:05:12,522
I don't know. I don't know how to read a map.
I never had to read maps.

759
01:05:20,447 --> 01:05:25,396
You'll be shot in the morning in the name
of the glorious Germany..

760
01:05:30,765 --> 01:05:35,478
Russian soldier - the Patriot. 
Pretty, but boring.

761
01:05:36,128 --> 01:05:40,040
- Who will win?
- Soviet Union in May, 1945.

762
01:05:40,326 --> 01:05:47,007
Colonel, in 43rd you'll be captured but in 1948 you'll 
return to Germany and become a great historian.

763
01:05:47,042 --> 01:05:48,281
You're crazy.

764
01:05:48,688 --> 01:05:54,126
You will write a book about WWII and 
receive a great award.

765
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:55,571
You're delirious!

766
01:05:55,607 --> 01:06:00,648
In your book you'll write about the fact
that right after your interrogate soviet scouts

767
01:06:00,682 --> 01:06:06,722
you will be called to Berlin to receive
the medal, Mr. Kurt Bornhof

768
01:06:06,888 --> 01:06:10,083
and you will not come back here.

769
01:06:22,487 --> 01:06:24,920
You, three, after me!

770
01:06:39,446 --> 01:06:41,642
Oh, pure Arian.

771
01:06:42,126 --> 01:06:46,247
Listen, Cherep, maybe you can chat to your 
people so they'd let us go, huh?

772
01:06:46,281 --> 01:06:47,290
Very funny.

773
01:06:47,327 --> 01:06:49,363
Why, they are like your family. 

774
01:06:51,408 --> 01:06:53,612
Who will sign the capitulation?

775
01:06:53,648 --> 01:06:57,408
From the Soviet Union: Gen. Zhukov,
from the U.S. Gen. Patton

776
01:06:57,441 --> 01:06:58,774
- from France...
- What?!

777
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:02,406
France?! These cowardly half-Jews
also won over us?!

778
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:05,999
Of course. It's a part of 
anti-Hitler coalition.

779
01:07:20,808 --> 01:07:22,160
Watch your step.

780
01:07:24,569 --> 01:07:27,876
Damn, legs are killing me!
Didn't I tell you to watch it!

781
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:32,961
Drink.

782
01:07:34,366 --> 01:07:36,676
You're brave soldier. 

783
01:07:49,926 --> 01:07:51,156
Eat.

784
01:07:55,447 --> 01:07:59,234
I don't eat after 1st.

785
01:08:20,447 --> 01:08:21,799
What about Hitler?

786
01:08:26,087 --> 01:08:30,687
He shot himself in the office basement.

787
01:08:30,722 --> 01:08:33,419
How is that possible?!

788
01:08:33,454 --> 01:08:36,118
How can you win?!

789
01:08:36,567 --> 01:08:39,132
You! Pig!

790
01:08:39,166 --> 01:08:44,327
Do you have any idea what is German Military Machine?!

791
01:08:44,363 --> 01:08:48,843
Mainshtein, Guderian, Paulus, Fon Klaist!

792
01:08:57,207 --> 01:09:03,563
Here, in Stalingrad, from Autumn 1942 -
Jan 1943 will be massive battles

793
01:09:03,598 --> 01:09:09,914
in which your famous Paulus will end up 
in a very tight ring and will be captured.

794
01:09:10,167 --> 01:09:17,327
and us, starting with Volga will start to advance,
and slowly, slowly, 

795
01:09:17,363 --> 01:09:19,397
slowly advance...

796
01:09:22,167 --> 01:09:23,645
towards Berlin

797
01:09:46,927 --> 01:09:48,759
- Guys...
- How is it?

798
01:09:51,565 --> 01:09:53,158
Asked to pass.

799
01:09:55,247 --> 01:09:56,646
Here

800
01:09:57,566 --> 01:09:58,794
Take it.

801
01:10:03,367 --> 01:10:07,678
- Won't eat, bastards
- Nice to meet you, local
- Filatov, Sergey

802
01:10:09,687 --> 01:10:11,085
Sokolov Dima

803
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:19,559
What did you say was your name?

804
01:10:20,088 --> 01:10:21,212
Sokolov Dima

805
01:10:21,246 --> 01:10:23,965
Dima, do you have a cigarette case?

806
01:10:25,607 --> 01:10:27,996
- Yes, only it's empty
- Can I take a look?

807
01:10:29,126 --> 01:10:30,196
Lets...

808
01:10:39,447 --> 01:10:41,642
- Let me take a look?
- Here.

809
01:10:46,245 --> 01:10:50,647
- What's that engraving?
- "To devotion to Revolution. By commander Budenny"

810
01:10:50,682 --> 01:10:53,481
My grandpa gave it to me, when I was going to War

811
01:10:57,888 --> 01:11:01,167
- Give back.
- Hey, stop it.
- Give back

812
01:11:01,201 --> 01:11:03,634
- Give back the cigarette case
- Don't give back. 

813
01:11:12,408 --> 01:11:15,013
How did you find out about the cigarette case?

814
01:11:15,048 --> 01:11:17,447
corporal Emelyanov told us.
Remember him?

815
01:11:17,482 --> 01:11:19,519
Yes, great man.

816
01:11:19,554 --> 01:11:21,558
- He saved my life
- Ours too.

817
01:11:22,086 --> 01:11:23,405
He died.

818
01:11:23,765 --> 01:11:27,317
- How? When?
- When he was covering our retreat. 

819
01:11:30,087 --> 01:11:32,971
- I'm so sorry. 
- Feel sorry for yourself instead. 

820
01:11:33,006 --> 01:11:37,045
- It's war. who's feeling sorry for themselves...
- its true
- ...only fucking cowards.

821
01:11:37,081 --> 01:11:38,925
Not everybody is a hero, like you.

822
01:11:39,846 --> 01:11:43,246
- Who would know about that if not you.
- I'm not following you guys. 

823
01:11:43,283 --> 01:11:44,964
If you do, you'll shit your pants.

824
01:11:45,447 --> 01:11:52,889
Especially when you find out that in 21st 
century, skinheads will walk Moscow streets 
dressed in black

825
01:11:52,923 --> 01:11:56,165
with Nazi symbols, raising their hands yell:
"Hi Hitler!" 

826
01:11:56,201 --> 01:11:58,048
Are you fucked in the head?

827
01:11:58,082 --> 01:11:58,957
- Huh
- What did you say?!

828
01:12:00,207 --> 01:12:02,596
- Get off me!
- I'll strangle you bastard!

829
01:12:06,208 --> 01:12:06,927
YELLING IN GERMAN

831
01:12:18,726 --> 01:12:19,715
Bitch!

832
01:12:20,405 --> 01:12:24,767
Tomorrow they'll execute us, and there will be
no right or wrong

833
01:12:24,802 --> 01:12:29,128
Will be! There always be right and wrong. 
Our path is right! 

834
01:12:29,162 --> 01:12:32,608
And never in Moscow will somebody shout "Hi Hitler" 

835
01:12:32,643 --> 01:12:34,564
Never, never, don't worry

836
01:12:35,446 --> 01:12:38,645
Alright. Enough. We're short of time. 
Got to get out of here.

837
01:12:39,368 --> 01:12:43,328
I'm digging a way out here.

838
01:12:47,927 --> 01:12:50,213
Nice! That's one hole!

839
01:12:50,248 --> 01:12:52,044
- And where are we getting out?
- Guys, dirt is soft! 

840
01:12:52,288 --> 01:12:54,973
- There is a guard!
- Only one.

841
01:12:55,008 --> 01:12:57,089
He's by the door. If we're quiet, he won't hear

842
01:12:57,123 --> 01:12:58,132
Then what?

843
01:12:58,167 --> 01:13:02,726
I saw, when we were lead to the interrogation,
there is a trench about 100 yards away

844
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:05,732
- But there are Germans there.
- Can't you jump over the trenches?

845
01:13:05,767 --> 01:13:10,127
Who's going to figure out who you are in the dark?
They'll shoot of course, but that'll be up to you, guys

846
01:13:10,163 --> 01:13:11,532
Why "you" and not you?

847
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:13,091
I can't. My leg .. 

848
01:13:13,128 --> 01:13:16,837
That bastard guard broke it when he was kicking me.

849
01:13:17,607 --> 01:13:20,328
- Well, what's there?
- I think this is it.

850
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:22,023
Stop coughing.

851
01:13:22,058 --> 01:13:23,686
Bitch, broke my tooth

852
01:13:27,129 --> 01:13:30,164
GERMAN SPEECH

853
01:13:33,766 --> 01:13:37,327
Ok, you first. 
If he makes it through, the rest will too.

854
01:13:37,363 --> 01:13:38,363
Come on. 

855
01:13:56,566 --> 01:13:58,444
Wait. 

856
01:14:09,645 --> 01:14:10,966
Here.

857
01:14:20,246 --> 01:14:22,399
Give it to my mom. 

858
01:14:25,128 --> 01:14:26,242
Come on. 

859
01:14:35,245 --> 01:14:36,599
K-Kh-Kha

860
01:14:51,768 --> 01:14:52,962
Oh God. 

861
01:14:54,808 --> 01:14:56,878
K-Kh-Kha

862
01:15:10,806 --> 01:15:13,195

864
01:15:19,242 --> 01:15:24,286

865
01:15:24,322 --> 01:15:27,086

868
01:15:52,245 --> 01:15:55,477
If we make it back, no word about the capture

869
01:15:58,646 --> 01:16:00,205
Freeze! Don't move!

870
01:16:00,728 --> 01:16:02,240
Who are you?!

871
01:16:02,846 --> 01:16:04,917
Scouts, coming back. 

872
01:16:06,446 --> 01:16:08,851
- You're going to get it!
- Go screw yourself!

873
01:16:08,887 --> 01:16:10,687
Where are you all coming from?!

874
01:16:10,722 --> 01:16:12,641
Listen, follow me, quick

875
01:16:14,088 --> 01:16:16,519
Ok, we just got back from a mission

876
01:16:17,129 --> 01:16:23,086
Stirred up the Germans, got back with
nothing, lost the corporal.

877
01:16:23,121 --> 01:16:25,249
He was an great, he'll be missed.

878
01:16:25,283 --> 01:16:28,400
But these buttheads came back in one piece.

879
01:16:29,486 --> 01:16:31,093
Not a single scratch.

880
01:16:31,129 --> 01:16:32,846
Magic.

881
01:16:32,887 --> 01:16:35,243
Where, where the justice?

882
01:16:35,687 --> 01:16:36,651
I'd like to know!

883
01:16:36,687 --> 01:16:39,693
That corporal alone was worth a whole unit.

884
01:16:39,726 --> 01:16:44,040
Right, good results are worth reporting up the chain.

885
01:16:44,567 --> 01:16:47,005
Get out of here.

886
01:16:47,041 --> 01:16:48,805
I'll call you back, we'll talk again. 

887
01:16:51,968 --> 01:16:53,116
Dear Nina

888
01:17:02,768 --> 01:17:05,282
Could not help myself, how are you here without me?

889
01:17:07,486 --> 01:17:08,885
You're back...

890
01:17:13,488 --> 01:17:15,045
my baby

891
01:17:16,567 --> 01:17:18,045
Alive.

892
01:17:30,448 --> 01:17:33,802
Serezhen'ka, I knew that everything's will be ok

893
01:17:34,407 --> 01:17:37,002
Nina, I'm very...

894
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:40,802
I ..

895
01:17:48,048 --> 01:17:49,365
Let's go

896
01:18:00,086 --> 01:18:01,837
Run-Run-Run-Run!

897
01:18:07,527 --> 01:18:08,756
Over here

898
01:18:14,168 --> 01:18:19,160
- It's certain now. 
- Comrades, we attack tomorrow

899
01:18:20,848 --> 01:18:24,366
Listen, Borman was right. 
We do attack tomorrow.

900
01:18:24,403 --> 01:18:26,448
If we attack, we'll get more what we asked for. 

901
01:18:26,483 --> 01:18:27,972
If we don't take off at night

902
01:18:28,007 --> 01:18:32,968
It's interesting, Borman is all over Nina there
and we're here waiting to die

903
01:18:33,002 --> 01:18:34,171
Stop whining?

904
01:18:34,205 --> 01:18:36,348
Borman said, - we're going to the lake at night.

905
01:18:36,383 --> 01:18:38,488
Let him say goodbye to the local talent

906
01:18:38,520 --> 01:18:40,892
He's probably having a lot of fun, Right Beroev?

907
01:18:40,927 --> 01:18:44,238
Sex, Sex is sooo nice!
Sex, Sex - without interruptions!
(Quote form a rap song in mid 90's)

908
01:18:46,407 --> 01:18:49,127
Your two, go screw yourself.
Assholes!

909
01:18:49,162 --> 01:18:51,036
Where are you going, retard?

910
01:18:57,406 --> 01:18:58,966
Trrrrrrr-oi-ho!

911
01:19:03,048 --> 01:19:04,162
Shoven Out!

912
01:19:04,409 --> 01:19:05,888
Uaaaa!

913
01:19:15,608 --> 01:19:18,564
Yeeehhh - Ha!
Yeha!

914
01:19:21,207 --> 01:19:22,331
Yessss!

915
01:19:22,366 --> 01:19:23,719
You're such a bastard, Borman.

916
01:19:24,446 --> 01:19:25,800
Uuuuuu-hahaha!

917
01:19:36,007 --> 01:19:37,521
Are you clumsy?

918
01:19:39,607 --> 01:19:41,119
Are you clumsy?

919
01:19:52,686 --> 01:19:54,119
Love you

920
01:19:54,567 --> 01:19:55,604
Love you

921
01:19:57,367 --> 01:19:58,720
Nothing

922
01:19:59,246 --> 01:20:01,079
- Come here
- Come here

923
01:20:02,167 --> 01:20:04,316
- Silly
- Silly

924
01:20:06,247 --> 01:20:07,725
Wait

925
01:20:16,007 --> 01:20:18,124
Aaaaaooi oi!

926
01:20:20,086 --> 01:20:21,645
Damn! My back!

927
01:20:25,686 --> 01:20:27,326
Mama!

928
01:20:28,246 --> 01:20:30,478
- Bitch!
- What do you think you're doing?!

929
01:20:39,929 --> 01:20:42,688
I see... everybody is a boxer

930
01:20:42,722 --> 01:20:45,449
Greetings, comrade Captain

931
01:20:45,482 --> 01:20:47,518
Huh, I see.

932
01:20:48,607 --> 01:20:50,517
What are you doing?
We're going to be court marshaled!

933
01:20:51,166 --> 01:20:52,811
There, Here some more!

934
01:20:52,847 --> 01:20:57,601
Excuse us, happens to everyone.
Don't pay attention, happens.

935
01:20:58,327 --> 01:21:00,286
It even happens to old friends

936
01:21:00,321 --> 01:21:02,355
We'll sort it out

937
01:21:04,248 --> 01:21:08,322
- Hey, where are they taking you?
- Ah, Nina! Hello.

938
01:21:09,406 --> 01:21:12,049
- To the basement, to be executed in the morning.
- What for?

939
01:21:12,083 --> 01:21:13,846
For fighting

940
01:21:13,882 --> 01:21:15,293
I see.

941
01:21:15,326 --> 01:21:17,283
Who gave an order?

942
01:21:18,287 --> 01:21:21,997
Lieutenant major Demin, and that 
officer from the Special Unit

943
01:21:23,047 --> 01:21:24,639
What are you looking at? Move!

944
01:21:28,326 --> 01:21:29,645
Comrade officer!

945
01:21:29,808 --> 01:21:34,367
Just wondering, why are Filatov and that one...
2nd soldier got arrested for?

946
01:21:34,402 --> 01:21:37,693
Is that the proper way to address to address and officer?

947
01:21:37,727 --> 01:21:42,208
On the other hand, what gives you the right
to ask an officer those kinds of questions?

948
01:21:42,243 --> 01:21:43,925
Want to be locked up in the basement too?

949
01:21:44,685 --> 01:21:50,126
Everybody's treating you too nice around here, 
and you're taking advantage of it!

950
01:21:50,161 --> 01:21:54,126
Arrested for fighting, disruption of order!

951
01:21:54,162 --> 01:21:56,003
In a combat situation.

952
01:21:56,048 --> 01:21:57,544
- Is that it?
- Questions?

953
01:21:57,580 --> 01:21:59,043
Dismissed, Polyakova!

954
01:22:04,205 --> 01:22:07,327
They'll be released in the morning
Why are you so worried about them

955
01:22:07,363 --> 01:22:10,449
I have feelings, lieutenant major

956
01:22:10,483 --> 01:22:11,674
- Whaaaaat?
- For whom?

957
01:22:12,405 --> 01:22:14,715
That's my business.

958
01:22:22,566 --> 01:22:27,765
Couldn't save the only pretty nurse...

959
01:22:28,605 --> 01:22:33,767
Those guests from the future.. 
showed up... stole our woman

960
01:22:33,803 --> 01:22:38,006
Who? Beroev?  or Filatov?

961
01:22:38,043 --> 01:22:39,919
I think it's ... Filatov

962
01:22:40,647 --> 01:22:42,683
He's the kind women like

963
01:22:43,046 --> 01:22:44,933
That must be him

964
01:22:44,967 --> 01:22:51,409
Looks like Beroev fell for Polyakova, 
and Filatov kicked his behind.

965
01:22:51,443 --> 01:22:56,685
That's the kind of order you're 
running here, lieutenant major.

966
01:22:56,726 --> 01:23:01,643
Ok, Where is this tough guys ... what's his name

967
01:23:01,969 --> 01:23:03,064
Serduk! 

968
01:23:03,099 --> 01:23:04,163
On my way!

969
01:23:05,487 --> 01:23:09,647
- Did you put the soldiers in the basement?
- That's right, I did it

970
01:23:09,679 --> 01:23:13,562
- Now let them go.
- Both of them?
- No, only one!

971
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:18,239
.... Beroev.

972
01:23:19,167 --> 01:23:21,133
Why him?

973
01:23:21,168 --> 01:23:23,387
- Well.. he got beat up..
- Yep.

974
01:23:23,423 --> 01:23:25,652
- ... his face is all mashed up..
- Yep.

975
01:23:25,687 --> 01:23:27,883
- ... injured another words
- Yep.

976
01:23:31,688 --> 01:23:34,804
- Here is one
- Where's Romeo?
- In the basement

977
01:23:35,768 --> 01:23:37,324
Zhorin gave an order

978
01:23:38,247 --> 01:23:39,724
Why's that?

979
01:23:40,689 --> 01:23:43,087
For order disruption.

980
01:23:43,121 --> 01:23:44,648
Did he kick your butt?

981
01:23:44,683 --> 01:23:46,302
I fell from the tree

982
01:23:46,338 --> 01:23:47,918
Yeah, right

983
01:23:48,368 --> 01:23:51,675
- And how long will he be there?
- How am I to know?! I didn't put him there!

984
01:23:54,489 --> 01:23:56,124
Dammit. 

985
01:23:57,166 --> 01:24:00,648
Well, looks like Berlin will make it without
our autographs

986
01:24:00,683 --> 01:24:03,401
- What are you talking about?
- Look here, we got a newborn activist!

987
01:24:03,448 --> 01:24:05,932
Quit skinheads, joined patriots

988
01:24:05,968 --> 01:24:09,358
- He's contemplating here how he'll join the attack.
- Awesome

989
01:24:09,727 --> 01:24:13,087
Really, awesome. I think I couldn't

990
01:24:13,122 --> 01:24:14,611
Nobody will ask you

991
01:24:14,648 --> 01:24:18,488
You'll get your 100grams of vodka and go, 
for Motherland, fight real dudes this time 

992
01:24:18,522 --> 01:24:19,692
And you're not going?

993
01:24:19,727 --> 01:24:23,209
Don't advise you either. Don't you get it?
We need to run to the lake ASAP

994
01:24:23,244 --> 01:24:23,972
What about Borman?

995
01:24:24,007 --> 01:24:27,246
What about him? Screw him! 

996
01:24:27,283 --> 01:24:29,523
- I'm not leaving without him.
- Me too.

997
01:24:31,005 --> 01:24:33,841
Screw you too! I'm going alone then!

998
01:24:34,607 --> 01:24:36,972
You can stay, and die

999
01:24:37,008 --> 01:24:39,919
Don't flatter yourself, Borman has
the cigarette case

1000
01:24:40,288 --> 01:24:41,401
..  Filatov! 

1001
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:51,444
Maybe we should try to save Filatov from
the basement?

1002
01:24:53,486 --> 01:24:57,648
Are you mad? That Special Unit shit is only
waiting for a chance to whack without a trial!

1003
01:24:57,683 --> 01:24:59,567
All we can do is sit and wait

1004
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:01,205
Do you get it? Sit and wait!

1005
01:25:18,488 --> 01:25:19,635
Serezha.

1006
01:25:19,928 --> 01:25:23,204
Serezha ... wake up, my baby

1007
01:25:23,607 --> 01:25:24,961
Good

1008
01:25:25,566 --> 01:25:27,000
There you go, come on

1009
01:25:27,768 --> 01:25:28,611
Good boy

1010
01:25:28,646 --> 01:25:32,006
Zhorin ordered to release you in 
the morning .. it's dawn already

1011
01:25:32,041 --> 01:25:33,966
Serduk gave me a key so I can bring you food

1012
01:25:34,002 --> 01:25:35,558
He's tough, but a sweetheart

1013
01:25:36,608 --> 01:25:38,007
There, good

1014
01:25:39,287 --> 01:25:41,801
No, no, this way

1015
01:25:56,325 --> 01:25:57,971
Eat.

1016
01:25:58,006 --> 01:26:00,842
We advance soon, you’ll need your strength

1017
01:26:02,169 --> 01:26:03,886
Silly

1018
01:26:04,608 --> 01:26:09,555
Don't be scared, you'll survive

1019
01:26:09,847 --> 01:26:11,486
That I can promise you

1020
01:26:16,766 --> 01:26:18,041
Nina..

1021
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:20,521
it is my time to leave.

1022
01:26:24,048 --> 01:26:25,241
No ... 

1023
01:26:37,846 --> 01:26:39,201
Sorry ...

1024
01:26:39,887 --> 01:26:41,082
Forgive me.

1025
01:26:44,766 --> 01:26:45,755
Nina...

1026
01:26:47,126 --> 01:26:48,160
No

1027
01:26:49,206 --> 01:26:53,359
Forgive me, Please forgive me.

1028
01:26:53,887 --> 01:26:55,240
Why?

1029
01:26:56,168 --> 01:26:57,600
Why?

1030
01:26:59,406 --> 01:27:01,398
Silly

1031
01:27:02,486 --> 01:27:03,806
My love..

1032
01:27:04,687 --> 01:27:06,406
What were you singing then ...

1033
01:27:06,488 --> 01:27:07,522
What?

1034
01:27:08,366 --> 01:27:09,719
I forgot the words.

1035
01:27:10,686 --> 01:27:12,039
Can't recall.

1036
01:27:14,086 --> 01:27:15,920
- and I can't recall
- What was it ...

1037
01:27:16,166 --> 01:27:17,202
One moment

1038
01:27:18,885 --> 01:27:21,560
- Because I needed...
- Yes

1039
01:27:21,966 --> 01:27:24,321
- ... your love
- Yes

1040
01:27:25,247 --> 01:27:30,686
- sometimes more than bread
- Yes

1041
01:27:31,526 --> 01:27:37,160
Because I thought ... 
Of you...

1042
01:28:25,127 --> 01:28:26,322
Look, he's alive

1043
01:28:27,007 --> 01:28:28,725
We thought they wouldn't let you

1044
01:28:34,489 --> 01:28:36,318
We didn't go to the lake

1045
01:28:37,046 --> 01:28:40,039
So got to figure out the next move

1046
01:28:41,565 --> 01:28:43,955
Can't go to the lake, ours will shoot us

1047
01:28:46,686 --> 01:28:49,917
We only have 1 option, join the attack

1048
01:28:51,046 --> 01:28:52,606
And see what happens. 

1049
01:28:55,247 --> 01:28:57,201
Let's stick together. 

1050
01:28:57,806 --> 01:29:00,560
Comrades, who can play guitar?

1051
01:29:01,927 --> 01:29:04,724
Come on, com one. Our guy hurt his hand

1052
01:29:05,044 --> 01:29:07,131
- Guys, I found one!
- Yeeeeeah !

1053
01:29:07,166 --> 01:29:11,159
- Come on! 
- Hit it !
- Here

1054
01:29:15,408 --> 01:29:16,681
SONG:

1055
01:29:22,367 --> 01:29:28,626
(Machine gun in hands, 
Because he's a soldier)

1056
01:29:28,661 --> 01:29:34,874
(Medals shining, because it's way)

1057
01:29:34,910 --> 01:29:41,087
(Came back home, because he's a hero)

1058
01:29:41,121 --> 01:29:46,287
(Came back home ....  Alive)

1059
01:29:47,208 --> 01:29:59,302
(This silence, sun shine
Said there is no more death)

1060
01:29:59,337 --> 01:30:11,401
(sun shine and silence suddenly 
announced - there no more war)

1061
01:30:27,488 --> 01:30:28,679
Follow me

1062
01:30:35,727 --> 01:30:36,874
Enough singing

1063
01:30:38,527 --> 01:30:39,755
Listen to the orders, soldiers.

1064
01:30:40,646 --> 01:30:41,681
Get ready to fight!

1065
01:30:54,327 --> 01:30:56,125
Get in position!

1066
01:31:00,846 --> 01:31:02,327
Fire!

1067
01:31:05,567 --> 01:31:06,683
YELLING IN GERMAN

1068
01:31:13,007 --> 01:31:14,012
Fire!

1069
01:31:14,047 --> 01:31:15,879
Come on guys.

1070
01:31:20,369 --> 01:31:21,642
Fire!

1071
01:31:34,966 --> 01:31:38,484
Tanks are coming through. Get down!

1072
01:31:41,366 --> 01:31:42,480
Get down!

1073
01:32:12,208 --> 01:32:15,185
For motherland! For Stalin!

1074
01:32:15,220 --> 01:32:18,167
- URAAAAAA !!!! (Gooooo)

Jump!

1093
01:34:36,526 --> 01:34:39,120
Where! Where, stupid?!

1094
01:34:47,126 --> 01:34:48,277
One moment.

1095
01:34:54,606 --> 01:34:56,439
Forward!

1096
01:34:56,767 --> 01:34:58,567
- Uraaa!

1097
01:34:58,602 --> 01:35:00,287
Come on, go!

AAaaa!

1102
01:35:50,049 --> 01:35:52,037
To the trench!

1103
01:35:59,569 --> 01:36:02,061
Is that you, home boy?

1104
01:36:02,096 --> 01:36:04,557
- Are you ok?
- I think so

1105
01:36:05,208 --> 01:36:07,037
We got what we asked for. 

1106
01:36:14,968 --> 01:36:16,241
We'll die.

1107
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:20,864
I have no idea what artillery did, 
All the foxholes are intact

1108
01:36:20,900 --> 01:36:24,325
comrade lieutenant major, 
I know how to get to the foxholes

1109
01:36:25,046 --> 01:36:28,566
There is a little valley that leads 
to German trenches

1110
01:36:28,602 --> 01:36:31,571
If we can make it, we can bomb the foxholes

1111
01:36:31,607 --> 01:36:34,405
How do you know that?
- That's the path we took when we went on our mission

1112
01:36:36,848 --> 01:36:38,643
Aaa! AAAAA!

1113
01:36:39,806 --> 01:36:42,195
Vitaly! Beroev! Down, quick!

1114
01:36:46,206 --> 01:36:48,243
- Do you have grenades?
- 2
- Take mine.

1115
01:36:49,046 --> 01:36:50,481
- Why?
- Because!

1116
01:36:51,607 --> 01:36:54,573
Noooo, I'm not going over there

1117
01:36:54,608 --> 01:36:57,724
What do you mean? Are you crazy?

1118
01:36:58,447 --> 01:37:01,120
I .. I will not go there

1119
01:37:03,326 --> 01:37:05,602
Do you want to get court-martialed!

1120
01:37:07,488 --> 01:37:12,162
Come on guys.. We can go forward
while that foxhole is active

1121
01:37:19,606 --> 01:37:20,518
Water

1122
01:37:23,367 --> 01:37:25,038
Bro, water. 

1123
01:37:50,486 --> 01:37:52,080
Hey, soldier, are you alive?

1124
01:37:52,327 --> 01:37:53,647
Serezha!

1125
01:37:55,886 --> 01:37:57,720
One moment

1126
01:37:58,408 --> 01:38:01,318
- Nina...
- Shhhhh, it'll be ok

1127
01:38:02,046 --> 01:38:04,243
- It's ok...
- Aaaa!
- Shhhhh, quiet now

1128
01:38:05,086 --> 01:38:06,725
Emotions, sorry.

1129
01:38:07,166 --> 01:38:10,159
Don't worry, they'll stitch you up

1130
01:38:10,846 --> 01:38:12,519
Main thing your bone is ok

1131
01:38:12,769 --> 01:38:14,838
The most important thing in a man - is a bone

1132
01:38:15,366 --> 01:38:16,641
Humor - good. 

1133
01:38:18,848 --> 01:38:21,965
- How much time has passed?
- What time?

1134
01:38:22,008 --> 01:38:23,967
- From the moment of the attack
- half an hour, no more. 

1135
01:38:24,002 --> 01:38:25,957
What half an hour, at least 3 hours!

1136
01:38:26,367 --> 01:38:28,720
1st battle, every minute seems like eternity

1137
01:38:29,128 --> 01:38:32,046
- There you go. Better?
- Yes, better.

1138
01:38:32,081 --> 01:38:35,007
Stay down. I'll go look while it quiet down

1139
01:38:35,042 --> 01:38:36,372
There are a lot of wounded

1140
01:38:36,407 --> 01:38:39,448
Why did it quiet down? Did we take the front line?

1141
01:38:39,483 --> 01:38:41,424
- No
- It's not good

1142
01:38:41,459 --> 01:38:43,367
- Now what
- Now?

1143
01:38:43,402 --> 01:38:44,923
WISTLE OF FALLING BOMB

1144
01:38:46,807 --> 01:38:52,327
Now I'll go forward, someone will take care of you here

1145
01:38:52,647 --> 01:38:53,717
That's it

1146
01:38:55,047 --> 01:38:56,196
Love you

1147
01:39:00,529 --> 01:39:02,280
You need to move back, got it?

1148
01:39:08,966 --> 01:39:10,481
it's ok. it's ok

1149
01:39:22,728 --> 01:39:23,444
just a little more

1150
01:39:23,807 --> 01:39:24,763
one moment. 

1151
01:39:25,726 --> 01:39:28,365
Alexander Vasilievich, dear ...

1152
01:39:30,086 --> 01:39:33,407
- comrade lieutenant major!
- Kolokoltsev, how did you get here?
- Come on, get in!

1153
01:39:33,443 --> 01:39:37,246
Commander was so mad, 
Threatened to shoot everyone 
If we don't establish communication with you

1154
01:39:37,281 --> 01:39:40,207
So I run the wire all the way
from our trenches

1155
01:39:40,242 --> 01:39:41,846
Good job!

1156
01:39:43,086 --> 01:39:45,362
"7th", "20th" is on-line

1157
01:39:47,127 --> 01:39:49,083
These foxholes won't let me through!

1158
01:39:53,166 --> 01:39:56,605
- Hey bro, are you wounded?
- No

1159
01:39:56,641 --> 01:39:58,249
So why are you heading back?

1160
01:39:58,281 --> 01:39:59,316
Changing positions.

1161
01:39:59,766 --> 01:40:02,918
I see. Come on join us, we got a perfect one

1162
01:40:04,285 --> 01:40:05,892
Got it, over.

1163
01:40:05,926 --> 01:40:08,807
So comrades, there will be another airstrike

1164
01:40:09,207 --> 01:40:10,718
in about 10 minutes.

1165
01:40:11,286 --> 01:40:14,835
If we don't take care of these foxholes
we're all going to die here

1166
01:40:19,409 --> 01:40:20,556
How could that happen

1167
01:40:20,926 --> 01:40:25,046
Alexander Vasilyevich..
Don't worry
...how did you manage, huh?

1168
01:40:25,081 --> 01:40:26,479
Hang in there

1169
01:40:43,967 --> 01:40:44,922
Nina.

1170
01:40:45,566 --> 01:40:46,919
Don't go there!

1171
01:40:51,927 --> 01:40:53,405
Get out of there! 

1172
01:40:58,609 --> 01:41:01,206
- Nooo! Go back ! 
- Hang in there sweetie

1173
01:41:01,240 --> 01:41:03,808
One moment, I'll come back for you

1174
01:41:03,842 --> 01:41:05,798
Just got to make it to the office.

1175
01:41:06,086 --> 01:41:08,999
Nina! Don't go! Leave! Leave!

1176
01:41:09,806 --> 01:41:11,159
Little bit more! Hold him

1177
01:41:12,526 --> 01:41:13,403
Hey !

1178
01:41:15,606 --> 01:41:16,518
Come on

1179
01:41:17,887 --> 01:41:20,168
- Come on.
- All together.
- Hold it, hold it

1180
01:41:20,203 --> 01:41:21,842
Don't go there

1181
01:41:21,876 --> 01:41:23,481
Hang in there

1182
01:41:24,208 --> 01:41:26,515
that's it, that's it, that's it
Take him in

1183
01:41:27,247 --> 01:41:28,918
Leave !!!

1184
01:41:30,008 --> 01:41:31,598
Careful. 

1185
01:41:31,727 --> 01:41:33,240
Hang in there

1186
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:37,441
Don't!!! Don't!!!

1187
01:41:40,448 --> 01:41:41,845
Don't!!!!

1188
01:42:07,248 --> 01:42:11,956
No!!  HA ha ha ha! Nothing happened!!!

1189
01:42:13,769 --> 01:42:15,486
Nothing ha.......

1190
01:43:24,047 --> 01:43:28,199
- Beroev, ready?
- Me? yes, I'm affraid

1191
01:43:29,568 --> 01:43:34,092
Everybody's afraid, but we have to fight

1192
01:43:34,127 --> 01:43:36,960
Come on, everything depends on us now

1193
01:43:40,808 --> 01:43:42,080
God

1194
01:43:43,209 --> 01:43:45,243
Come on

1195
01:43:52,769 --> 01:43:53,916
Unit!!!! 

1196
01:43:54,366 --> 01:43:55,482
Fire !!! 

1197
01:44:04,688 --> 01:44:06,325
Boy it's hammering down

1198
01:44:20,927 --> 01:44:24,327
That's our fire. Hope we don't get caught

1199
01:44:24,362 --> 01:44:26,240
- What if we do
- If only ..

1200
01:44:26,274 --> 01:44:28,119
Oh mama, what if I'm pregnant!!

1201
01:44:29,126 --> 01:44:30,719
Crawl! or I'll kiss your ass

1202
01:44:32,687 --> 01:44:34,930
Vitally! Oleg!

1203
01:44:34,967 --> 01:44:37,399
Hey! Sergey is here

1204
01:44:38,488 --> 01:44:40,044
Where?

1205
01:44:40,167 --> 01:44:42,647
- Where we're going?
- Demin ordered to blow up that fox hole

1206
01:44:42,682 --> 01:44:44,159
...The one we stole an officer from

1207
01:44:44,328 --> 01:44:46,601
- You're wounded
- I know

1208
01:44:59,807 --> 01:45:02,862
- We got to get up
- Can't

1209
01:45:02,895 --> 01:45:05,916
Darn fox holes, can't stick a head out

1210
01:45:43,407 --> 01:45:44,634
AAAAA!

1211
01:45:45,847 --> 01:45:47,123
Aaaaaa!

1212
01:45:51,046 --> 01:45:52,079

1213
01:45:59,167 --> 01:45:59,996
Aaaa!

1214
01:46:00,208 --> 01:46:01,401
Get down!

1215
01:46:19,287 --> 01:46:20,686
Awesome

1216
01:46:20,889 --> 01:46:24,597
Attack! Let's go comrades!

1217
01:46:26,087 --> 01:46:28,204
Forward!

1218
01:46:28,888 --> 01:46:32,641
- Let's go comrades!
- Uraaaaaa!

1219
01:46:34,327 --> 01:46:37,842
Do you need a special invitation?

1220
01:46:38,367 --> 01:46:39,243
Well?

1221
01:46:39,808 --> 01:46:43,084

1236
01:48:43,646 --> 01:48:45,364
Yes, we got it Comrade "7"

01:48:45,928 --> 01:48:49,316
Yes, they are running. 

1238

Alive! Alive!

1239
01:50:20,765 --> 01:50:23,282
You're alive, silly

1240
