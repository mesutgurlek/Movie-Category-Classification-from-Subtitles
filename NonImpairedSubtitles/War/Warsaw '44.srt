1
00:02:26,734 --> 00:02:28,166
Open up.

2
00:02:29,653 --> 00:02:30,805
Hold on.

3
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:42,325
Stop it,
we'll get this over with faster.

4
00:02:42,892 --> 00:02:45,364
- Give him a break, please.
- I have to do this.

5
00:02:45,373 --> 00:02:47,404
Leave him alone.
Stefan!

6
00:02:49,132 --> 00:02:50,084
At three.

7
00:02:50,212 --> 00:02:53,564
- One, two... three.
- You're stupid!

8
00:02:53,891 --> 00:02:55,843
Madam, it's over.

9
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,610
My dearest Lady Macbeth,

10
00:03:00,611 --> 00:03:03,403
this show is really poor...

11
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:05,563
In fact it's mediocre.

12
00:03:05,851 --> 00:03:07,363
Mum!

13
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,841
What are you doing up so early?

14
00:03:28,929 --> 00:03:30,888
Take this to 'The Actresses'
in Mazowiecka Street.

15
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:33,208
Tell them it's for Ariadna...
Please...

16
00:03:33,209 --> 00:03:34,721
Don't stop, get moving!

17
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:37,800
Morning, boss!
Boss!

18
00:03:38,688 --> 00:03:40,840
- Women! Devils incarnate!
- Right!

19
00:03:40,848 --> 00:03:44,520
- Will you spare a fiver, boss...?
- I have nothing, chief.

20
00:03:46,608 --> 00:03:49,200
Leave him alone.
We'll lose her.

21
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:11,474
Citizens of Warsaw!

22
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,373
All acts of disobedience against

23
00:05:15,432 --> 00:05:18,651
the German authorities
will be punished.

24
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,031
That's why today we will execute
another 40 people

25
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,712
who were recently pardoned.

26
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:29,752
Get moving!

27
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:34,116
Which crates stay,
which ones go?

28
00:05:34,175 --> 00:05:35,790
Get to work, Stefan!

29
00:05:35,799 --> 00:05:39,351
- Watch what you're doing!
- These go, those stay.

30
00:05:39,918 --> 00:05:41,528
So you want to be the chairman?

31
00:05:41,587 --> 00:05:43,248
That's right, your deputy!

32
00:05:44,238 --> 00:05:46,829
- He wants to be the chairman!
- Girls!

33
00:06:03,877 --> 00:06:09,628
Young man! Come here!
Put these in the car.

34
00:06:17,396 --> 00:06:20,668
- In the car.
- I don't understand.

35
00:06:20,675 --> 00:06:21,724
I'm sorry, sir!

36
00:06:21,782 --> 00:06:24,645
The boy probably
didn't understand you.

37
00:06:24,755 --> 00:06:26,627
Get this out of here.

38
00:06:28,955 --> 00:06:32,049
Your men aren't
overexerting themselves.

39
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:33,164
He's new.

40
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,899
What a great day today!

41
00:06:35,957 --> 00:06:38,524
Great days are long gone.

42
00:06:44,673 --> 00:06:46,586
Don't you dare scratch anything!

43
00:06:46,673 --> 00:06:47,746
Hermann!

44
00:07:00,513 --> 00:07:02,064
Is he legally employed?

45
00:07:02,353 --> 00:07:04,345
They're all legal at my factory.

46
00:07:04,553 --> 00:07:07,344
You hire some pretty defiant characters.

47
00:07:08,312 --> 00:07:10,063
Your papers.

48
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,582
Just look at that expression on his face!

49
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:31,422
Where do you pigs get
all that hostility?

50
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:36,022
You understand
every single word I say, don't you?

51
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:41,501
Is this how much you want us
to leave your city?

52
00:07:45,509 --> 00:07:46,381
No problem.

53
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:49,989
It's just that when we go,

54
00:07:50,047 --> 00:07:52,468
we'll be replaced by
communists from Russia.

55
00:07:52,468 --> 00:07:54,460
And then you'll beg us to come back.

56
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:58,220
You can always count on me, miss.
Goodbye!

57
00:07:59,788 --> 00:08:01,660
- Dad!
- When are you finishing?

58
00:08:01,667 --> 00:08:03,580
- I'm coming!
- We're waiting and waiting.

59
00:08:07,268 --> 00:08:09,147
I don't know where you got it
and what it's for.

60
00:08:09,148 --> 00:08:12,099
I'm not going to inform on you
but I don't want to see you again.

61
00:08:13,507 --> 00:08:15,298
Take your rubbish and get out.

62
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:21,625
We'll take care of it.
Don't try to play hero.

63
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,625
We'll get you new papers and a job.
We'll help you out.

64
00:08:24,626 --> 00:08:26,505
I'll manage, thanks.

65
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:29,498
- How exactly will you do that?
- Don't worry.

66
00:08:29,585 --> 00:08:32,498
Without papers they'll send you
to a labour camp in Germany.

67
00:08:32,505 --> 00:08:34,824
- Maybe.
- I know it's my fault.

68
00:08:34,825 --> 00:08:36,578
Ha, I've seen everything!

69
00:08:36,745 --> 00:08:38,857
There's nothing to see...
We were just...

70
00:08:39,145 --> 00:08:42,064
'We were just'!
And then suddenly there's kids.

71
00:08:42,065 --> 00:08:46,016
- Have you seen them?
- Keep on playing!

72
00:08:49,384 --> 00:08:52,056
- Jasio!
- Don't tell your mum anything.

73
00:08:52,183 --> 00:08:53,696
Leave for work as usual.

74
00:08:55,944 --> 00:08:57,135
Jasio!

75
00:09:00,783 --> 00:09:02,616
Thank you.

76
00:09:11,902 --> 00:09:15,466
So I'm walking and a
few thugs come up

77
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:17,294
to steal my wallet.

78
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:20,853
And one of them had a knife.
Hence the cut.

79
00:09:20,901 --> 00:09:24,694
Can I have a cut like that?
Please!

80
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:29,052
- Really? Like this?
- Yes!

81
00:09:29,061 --> 00:09:31,453
Here you go.
The other cheek.

82
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:34,293
- How do I look?
- Like me.

83
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:37,212
-Cool...
- Get up.

84
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,892
Fast.

85
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:48,211
Mum, thugs've cut Stefan's cheek!

86
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:52,571
Luckily just the cheek.

87
00:09:52,579 --> 00:09:55,291
Mum, you've ruined my tower!

88
00:09:57,459 --> 00:09:58,971
Put that on.

89
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:05,337
Don't come round here again,
stop bothering people!

90
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:09,570
Why don't you cut that out
or you'll lose face!

91
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:12,009
Spare a fiver, boss?

92
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:37,688
Hi!

93
00:10:39,695 --> 00:10:43,054
- So, how's things?
- Here I am! Where are we going?

94
00:10:43,055 --> 00:10:45,087
Wow, how direct!
On a trip!

95
00:10:48,255 --> 00:10:51,845
- Look where you're going, you idiot!
- At one desk!

96
00:10:51,854 --> 00:10:53,966
- The wimp kept taking my stuff!
- I remember that!

97
00:10:54,494 --> 00:10:57,973
He crapped in his pants
and put the stuff in my satchel!

98
00:10:57,974 --> 00:11:01,445
- Don't tell her!
- His mum had to apologise to my parents.

99
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:03,772
She invited them
to the theatre she was in

100
00:11:03,773 --> 00:11:06,925
and the play was awful,
my parents left in the middle.

101
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:11,085
- The director was an idiot.
- Turn here!

102
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:14,524
I'm sure your mum is a great person...

103
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,611
I'm so happy!

104
00:11:16,612 --> 00:11:19,924
And I've been wondering
what was going on with you.

105
00:11:19,932 --> 00:11:23,171
Someone said you're working,
or you'd left.

106
00:11:23,172 --> 00:11:25,684
And here you are!
The underground is so much fun!

107
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:27,211
- We've got the best girls.
- Wladek!

108
00:11:27,212 --> 00:11:29,809
What? You know what
my nickname is?

109
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:31,251
Crybaby! Cool, huh?

110
00:11:31,252 --> 00:11:33,563
You idiot, he's not conspiring...

111
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:38,290
- Oh! You're not?
- No, I'm not.

112
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,370
- So what will you be doing?
- Well?

113
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:41,802
- Depends.
- On what?

114
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:44,289
- On chance!
- I won't take chances.

115
00:11:44,290 --> 00:11:46,842
I need papers, a job -
some peace and quiet.

116
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:52,041
- Hi, this is your Coco Chanel outfit.
- Hi Crybaby!

117
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:55,641
You've met Rogal.
I'll show you everything.

118
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,760
- Instruct him.
- Yes, sir!

119
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:01,281
Well, well...

120
00:12:01,969 --> 00:12:04,800
The bucket is under the sink,
and there's water in the tap.

121
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:07,640
The brush!

122
00:12:28,566 --> 00:12:31,878
- Hello, gentlemen!
- Good morning!

123
00:12:32,766 --> 00:12:35,798
Guys, let's unload the crates.

124
00:12:36,206 --> 00:12:37,918
To the office.

125
00:12:37,925 --> 00:12:39,838
- That's the last shipment.
- What?

126
00:12:39,845 --> 00:12:41,478
Let me go first.

127
00:12:41,486 --> 00:12:42,917
Careful.

128
00:12:44,165 --> 00:12:46,117
Easy with that, please!

129
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,872
Ala! Come back!

130
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,032
Ala!

131
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,512
- Here!
- Ala, come back!

132
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:10,591
- Come back!
- Ala!

133
00:14:11,798 --> 00:14:15,390
- Are we coming back?
- I'm staying. Forever.

134
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:17,110
Ala's staying forever.

135
00:14:17,678 --> 00:14:20,110
My sister -
we're teaching her to swim.

136
00:14:20,158 --> 00:14:23,230
- For now, we teach, you watch.
- Morning.

137
00:14:23,797 --> 00:14:24,949
Morning.

138
00:14:25,358 --> 00:14:27,397
Someone has to get her back.

139
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:29,949
- She won't do it on her own.
- Aleksander, go get your sister!

140
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:31,429
- I can't, my arm hurts.
- Your arm?

141
00:14:31,957 --> 00:14:33,916
- Crybaby!
- I'm busy on holiday.

142
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,949
- So we aren't coming back?
- Change of plans.

143
00:14:35,997 --> 00:14:39,068
- Rogal will get her.
- No, Stefan!

144
00:14:39,076 --> 00:14:41,268
- He's a better candidate.
- Stefan will!

145
00:14:41,277 --> 00:14:42,468
That's right!

146
00:14:42,477 --> 00:14:45,348
Raise your hand
if you vote for Stefan.

147
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:47,747
Me too!

148
00:15:02,715 --> 00:15:04,306
Hang on there!

149
00:15:04,395 --> 00:15:08,946
- The rescue's coming.
- The rescue's swimming.

150
00:15:38,152 --> 00:15:39,304
Come.

151
00:16:27,827 --> 00:16:29,180
Just trying.

152
00:16:30,308 --> 00:16:31,620
Mum, please!

153
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,379
You look like dad!

154
00:16:45,507 --> 00:16:46,858
Me too!

155
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:55,137
Madam, may I have this dance?

156
00:17:13,064 --> 00:17:17,336
Swear you won't get mixed up
in anything. Swear!

157
00:17:17,743 --> 00:17:22,255
I swear that I will bear
true faith to my Fatherland,

158
00:17:22,264 --> 00:17:26,095
that I will defend its honour
and fight for its liberation,

159
00:17:26,143 --> 00:17:28,734
even if it means
sacrificing my life.

160
00:17:28,782 --> 00:17:32,814
I pledge obedience
to the President of Poland

161
00:17:32,862 --> 00:17:36,894
and the Home Army Commander
whom he has appointed.

162
00:17:37,782 --> 00:17:41,375
I pledge to resolutely keep secret
whatever may happen to me.

163
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:44,334
I accept you into the ranks
of the Polish Army,

164
00:17:44,542 --> 00:17:48,053
waging a war with the enemy
for the liberation of our Fatherland.

165
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:51,293
It will be your duty to engage
in armed combat.

166
00:17:51,461 --> 00:17:54,772
Victory will be your reward.
Treason will be punished by death.

167
00:17:54,781 --> 00:17:58,012
So help us God!
Everything clear?

168
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:58,772
Clear.

169
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:02,653
Not 'clear' but:
'Yes, sir!'

170
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:04,573
Yes, sir!

171
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:10,972
And put those shoes back in the wardrobe,
you're not in the circus. Congrats!

172
00:18:13,739 --> 00:18:17,452
- These are lovely. His dad's.
- First class!

173
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,091
Enough!

174
00:18:24,979 --> 00:18:28,291
- Two rounds per person, I said!
- No, you did not.

175
00:18:28,658 --> 00:18:32,650
- Easy, Goral!
- That's no playground!

176
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:35,378
You've got to listen to the commander.

177
00:18:35,379 --> 00:18:37,809
The guy's new,
but see how accurate he is.

178
00:18:37,898 --> 00:18:41,490
So what?
Your life may depend on obedience.

179
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:45,497
This is Stefan Zawadzki -
son of Hanna Zawadzka - the actress.

180
00:18:45,498 --> 00:18:48,169
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes, we know her!

181
00:18:48,697 --> 00:18:52,888
I admired your mother's acting
in that comedy starring Bodo.

182
00:18:52,976 --> 00:18:54,649
With Dymsza,
her best role.

183
00:18:54,776 --> 00:18:57,608
- Great actress. A brunette, right?
- No, a blonde.

184
00:18:57,816 --> 00:19:01,335
- A Greta Garbo lookalike.
- That's half the battle.

185
00:19:01,336 --> 00:19:03,767
You know Ala? Ala...

186
00:19:05,016 --> 00:19:06,328
What's your...?

187
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:08,847
- Stefan.
- But we have already met.

188
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:11,568
- It doesn't matter, let's do it again.
- Nice to meet you.

189
00:19:12,215 --> 00:19:13,174
Well, well!

190
00:19:13,175 --> 00:19:15,040
Nalkowska visits us and
she must've drummed

191
00:19:15,099 --> 00:19:16,885
all this emancipation
into Ala's head.

192
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:20,038
Okay, who's drumming emancipation
here in the first place?

193
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,246
That's just like Papa.
Please join us for dinner!

194
00:19:23,255 --> 00:19:27,286
He's not shy,
he's just unrefined.

195
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,715
You know what his
situation is at home.

196
00:19:29,773 --> 00:19:32,172
His mother is
apparently not quite...

197
00:19:32,173 --> 00:19:34,045
- No.
- So you said.

198
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:38,164
We'll get back before curfew?
Mum is probably worried.

199
00:19:38,652 --> 00:19:40,565
We eat, then we go.

200
00:19:40,893 --> 00:19:43,884
An uprising in these circumstances
makes no sense.

201
00:19:44,013 --> 00:19:47,284
The Russians will come.
But they're bound to stay for good.

202
00:19:47,852 --> 00:19:51,084
- The West will help.
- We are part of Europe.

203
00:19:51,212 --> 00:19:53,851
They don't give a damn
about our country.

204
00:19:53,852 --> 00:19:55,971
The Poles are counting on Russian help,

205
00:19:55,972 --> 00:19:59,483
but so far no-one's heard
of any talks with Stalin,

206
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:02,123
who doesn't give a damn about us,
pardon my French.

207
00:20:02,131 --> 00:20:03,890
I need to go.
Who's got the keys?

208
00:20:03,891 --> 00:20:06,443
- Don't you like it here?
- I need to go.

209
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:14,403
- Stefan wants to go home.
- No, we'll go in the morning.

210
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:17,442
We have to wait.
The goods arrive in the morning.

211
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,506
As in the paintings of Delacroix.

212
00:20:22,564 --> 00:20:23,908
Dad, nobody's listening.

213
00:20:34,888 --> 00:20:37,720
- Stefan, what is it?
- You said fifteen minutes!

214
00:20:37,969 --> 00:20:39,520
A hero! Alright!

215
00:21:07,645 --> 00:21:09,038
How is it?

216
00:21:18,964 --> 00:21:20,437
Here you are at last!

217
00:21:30,124 --> 00:21:32,795
Quiet!
Can you hear it?

218
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:36,476
The front line!

219
00:21:36,724 --> 00:21:38,556
Things are going to happen!

220
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:52,480
How could you do this to me?

221
00:21:52,539 --> 00:21:55,012
You've been lying all this time!

222
00:21:55,162 --> 00:21:57,354
I thought they've killed you!

223
00:21:57,762 --> 00:21:59,720
You promised!
You're a traitor!

224
00:21:59,721 --> 00:22:02,154
- Mum, please!
- You're a liar!

225
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:05,433
- Mum, please!
- Everyone's lying.

226
00:22:05,641 --> 00:22:07,753
You're all liars!

227
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:13,193
He also lied he'd return home!
Can't you get it?

228
00:22:13,241 --> 00:22:19,393
He also said
he would return home!

229
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:26,071
I've got no one left, I'm all alone...

230
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:32,071
There's no one left, I'm all alone...

231
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:50,069
Sweetheart, get up.
Get up!

232
00:22:55,877 --> 00:22:57,789
Wake mum up,
I don't have the guts to.

233
00:23:03,837 --> 00:23:05,349
Don't sit there.

234
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:09,189
- The Russians have reached Warsaw.
- Yeah, and...?

235
00:23:10,516 --> 00:23:13,348
The uprising starts today,
I've just found out.

236
00:23:13,876 --> 00:23:16,068
The further away from the city, the better.

237
00:23:20,356 --> 00:23:21,988
You're going to thank me for that!

238
00:23:33,274 --> 00:23:34,347
Myshkin...

239
00:23:36,914 --> 00:23:38,466
What am I to do?

240
00:23:39,315 --> 00:23:40,467
Tell me.

241
00:23:50,552 --> 00:23:53,225
- How's my horse?
- It's still not ready.

242
00:23:53,233 --> 00:23:53,992
Hi!

243
00:23:53,993 --> 00:23:56,112
- So, can I ride it now?
- No, you can't.

244
00:23:56,113 --> 00:23:57,472
- Please!
- Back to your friends.

245
00:23:57,473 --> 00:24:01,105
- It's gonna be fine soon!
- Great!

246
00:24:01,632 --> 00:24:04,224
- At the factory.
- Today?

247
00:24:04,672 --> 00:24:06,384
How long can it take?

248
00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:10,176
They say two or three days.
The Soviets have taken Legionowo.

249
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,783
Kama!

250
00:24:14,831 --> 00:24:16,023
See you!

251
00:24:16,751 --> 00:24:17,823
Coming.

252
00:24:21,311 --> 00:24:22,583
Let's go.

253
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:42,381
Jasio!

254
00:24:42,909 --> 00:24:45,061
Come see! Mum's cooking.

255
00:24:47,988 --> 00:24:50,900
Jasio! Have a try!

256
00:24:54,228 --> 00:24:55,540
What are you doing?

257
00:24:58,028 --> 00:24:59,180
Nothing.

258
00:25:00,988 --> 00:25:02,339
Tell me.

259
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:05,459
I can't.

260
00:25:05,947 --> 00:25:07,660
Please.

261
00:25:07,867 --> 00:25:09,139
Oh, stop it.

262
00:25:09,388 --> 00:25:11,500
- Where are you going?
- Jasio!

263
00:25:12,027 --> 00:25:15,298
- Jasio, please!
- Don't leave me.

264
00:25:15,307 --> 00:25:17,338
Please!
I don't want to be alone.

265
00:25:17,347 --> 00:25:21,098
You mustn't snivel.
Take care of mum, the way I do, OK?

266
00:25:22,227 --> 00:25:24,138
You can't tell mum, OK?

267
00:25:24,346 --> 00:25:27,544
Please don't go.
You won't leave me, right?

268
00:25:27,545 --> 00:25:29,177
Don't tell mum...

269
00:25:30,266 --> 00:25:31,377
Jasio!

270
00:25:31,625 --> 00:25:33,977
Please don't go.

271
00:26:57,379 --> 00:26:59,170
Gosh... this is beautiful...

272
00:26:59,658 --> 00:27:01,890
- Hi, guys!
- No respect for orders!

273
00:27:02,058 --> 00:27:06,129
- Rogal, here you are.
- Why didn't you come tomorrow?

274
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:09,536
Thanks, the right or the left arm?
- The left one.

275
00:27:09,537 --> 00:27:11,689
- Here you are.
- So...

276
00:27:11,817 --> 00:27:13,849
It's going to be an interesting day.

277
00:27:14,378 --> 00:27:16,369
Who's afraid? Admit it!

278
00:27:17,217 --> 00:27:18,889
- Me.
- Yeah, sure!

279
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:21,449
Where's Aleksander?

280
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:24,895
This VIS is rather for an officer.
Perhaps you could use it.

281
00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:25,848
You're right!

282
00:27:27,576 --> 00:27:28,768
How many of you are there?

283
00:27:29,456 --> 00:27:31,687
There were eight,
but one didn't make it.

284
00:27:31,896 --> 00:27:33,727
How many of you 'are'
not 'were' there?

285
00:27:34,096 --> 00:27:35,247
Seven.

286
00:27:36,295 --> 00:27:37,734
Take mine.

287
00:27:37,735 --> 00:27:39,087
Thank you.

288
00:27:42,415 --> 00:27:43,407
Attention!

289
00:27:43,535 --> 00:27:46,686
Listen, we're joining another detail.
This is Cobra.

290
00:27:47,175 --> 00:27:48,293
At ease.

291
00:27:48,294 --> 00:27:50,286
- Lieutenant Cobra.
- Greetings.

292
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:55,326
All men - weaklings,
but the girls are gorgeous...

293
00:27:56,134 --> 00:27:58,205
Now, together we're going to...

294
00:27:59,093 --> 00:28:00,646
eat, sleep...

295
00:28:02,333 --> 00:28:03,965
and maybe even...

296
00:28:04,612 --> 00:28:08,085
- ... do a little singing.
- I've already got a partner for a duet.

297
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:09,532
Which one?

298
00:28:09,532 --> 00:28:10,772
He's not here yet.

299
00:28:10,773 --> 00:28:12,844
The absent have no say.

300
00:28:13,572 --> 00:28:16,852
Let's shake hands.
Thank you. The map.

301
00:28:16,852 --> 00:28:19,664
There are Jewish prisoners
in the building.

302
00:28:19,723 --> 00:28:22,284
We're covering an
attack from the north.

303
00:28:22,332 --> 00:28:26,444
This is a school.
We're attacking from the front.

304
00:28:27,611 --> 00:28:28,574
Where are the others?

305
00:28:28,633 --> 00:28:30,171
We had no way of
letting them know.

306
00:28:30,172 --> 00:28:32,123
So, we're missing half of our people too.

307
00:28:32,332 --> 00:28:34,042
We'll get by.

308
00:28:34,291 --> 00:28:35,443
Let it start!

309
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:38,163
What about... the weapons?

310
00:28:38,331 --> 00:28:39,603
Don't you have your own?

311
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,922
Where from?

312
00:28:41,931 --> 00:28:44,162
Spider, give a hand grenade each.

313
00:28:44,211 --> 00:28:47,282
Excuse me. We're attacking
with just two pieces?

314
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:50,162
Two days tops and it'll be over.

315
00:28:50,569 --> 00:28:52,202
Attention!

316
00:28:56,809 --> 00:28:58,968
Soldiers of the Polish
Underground State!

317
00:28:58,969 --> 00:29:01,801
Soviet divisions are waiting
on the outskirts of the capital.

318
00:29:02,528 --> 00:29:04,727
We're counting on them
to take advantage of our uprising

319
00:29:04,728 --> 00:29:06,880
and enter the city within days.

320
00:29:07,728 --> 00:29:10,000
Remember who you pledged allegiance to.

321
00:29:10,687 --> 00:29:12,879
You answer only to
the Polish Commander-in-Chief

322
00:29:12,888 --> 00:29:14,560
and the command of the Home Army.

323
00:29:14,568 --> 00:29:17,199
There is no fraternising
with the Bolsheviks.

324
00:29:17,767 --> 00:29:20,440
The Soviets are to be treated with reserve,

325
00:29:20,499 --> 00:29:22,016
as allies of our allies.

326
00:29:22,407 --> 00:29:23,718
Disperse!

327
00:29:23,927 --> 00:29:25,079
At ease!

328
00:29:25,367 --> 00:29:26,319
To your positions.

329
00:30:02,924 --> 00:30:04,036
Rogal!
Spider!

330
00:30:11,843 --> 00:30:13,122
Crybaby! Grenade!

331
00:30:13,123 --> 00:30:15,315
- Should I throw it?
- No, bloody eat it!

332
00:30:25,842 --> 00:30:27,034
Stefan, stop...

333
00:30:27,681 --> 00:30:28,554
Stefan, stop!

334
00:30:28,922 --> 00:30:30,114
Get back!

335
00:30:30,282 --> 00:30:31,554
That's an order!

336
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,552
Stefan, stop!

337
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:52,432
Stop!

338
00:30:54,679 --> 00:30:56,071
Turn round!

339
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,512
Hands up!

340
00:31:03,639 --> 00:31:05,151
We've got a prisoner.

341
00:31:42,276 --> 00:31:44,948
Don't be afraid.
We're Polish soldiers.

342
00:31:45,796 --> 00:31:48,107
There's an uprising.
You are free.

343
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:04,426
Can I join you?

344
00:32:07,114 --> 00:32:10,546
The uprising is almost over, mate...
You're free.

345
00:32:11,034 --> 00:32:12,866
I want to fight.

346
00:32:13,354 --> 00:32:14,745
The school's taken.

347
00:32:15,314 --> 00:32:16,745
I have no-one else left.

348
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:23,145
Alright.

349
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:25,304
Come, mate, you can come in handy.

350
00:32:28,832 --> 00:32:30,031
Stefan...

351
00:32:30,032 --> 00:32:31,384
Give me the gun.

352
00:32:36,152 --> 00:32:40,023
Playing a hero?
Try it again and you'll be sorry.

353
00:32:51,671 --> 00:32:55,109
- Where are you heading, gentlemen?
- Paris, may I, madam.

354
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:57,222
- What's your name?
- What business is it of yours?

355
00:32:57,230 --> 00:33:00,222
- Was I asking you?
- Want me to pick up your boy?

356
00:33:36,388 --> 00:33:38,546
- First day behind us! Hi, girls!
- Hi!

357
00:33:38,547 --> 00:33:40,262
They're gorgeous with
those uniforms on.

358
00:33:40,321 --> 00:33:42,186
Wonder what they look
like with them off.

359
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,865
Please, leave this.
It's army supplies.

360
00:33:43,866 --> 00:33:44,738
Rogal!

361
00:33:45,427 --> 00:33:47,178
- This one or that one?
- This one.

362
00:33:47,187 --> 00:33:48,219
Stefan!

363
00:33:48,267 --> 00:33:50,298
You're on guard duty!
Watching the food.

364
00:33:50,307 --> 00:33:52,544
- OK.
- We've got a piece for you.

365
00:33:52,545 --> 00:33:55,857
- Miki! Show him.
- OK.

366
00:33:56,545 --> 00:33:57,697
Listen...

367
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:00,977
It's an accurate gun,
it's just that parts are worn out.

368
00:34:14,503 --> 00:34:15,976
We've got the city centre.

369
00:34:15,984 --> 00:34:19,296
But we failed to take
the railway station and the bridges.

370
00:34:19,304 --> 00:34:20,735
The boys are still fighting.

371
00:34:20,743 --> 00:34:21,895
And the Russians?

372
00:34:22,224 --> 00:34:23,455
No idea.

373
00:34:24,264 --> 00:34:26,702
- Goral, come!
- At least we've got the warehouse.

374
00:34:26,703 --> 00:34:29,616
That's almost with no losses.
Go get some sleep.

375
00:34:30,822 --> 00:34:31,854
Here.

376
00:34:33,383 --> 00:34:36,694
- We're running out of wine.
- Poor guy...

377
00:34:37,582 --> 00:34:39,455
Where was he from anyway?

378
00:34:40,343 --> 00:34:41,894
That was Cobra's brother.

379
00:34:42,062 --> 00:34:45,214
No way. His brother?
I'd break down.

380
00:34:50,062 --> 00:34:51,493
Why aren't you singing?

381
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:54,574
- Why don't you have a drink!
- I'll go get something.

382
00:34:54,621 --> 00:34:55,980
- I'll go with you.
- Easy, I'll go.

383
00:34:55,981 --> 00:34:57,573
No, you keep playing.

384
00:34:57,621 --> 00:34:59,133
- Where to?
- Just look around.

385
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,092
- Bottles may be anywhere.
- Shall we?

386
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:03,812
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

387
00:35:10,579 --> 00:35:12,691
So where are we going?

388
00:35:12,739 --> 00:35:14,492
Why don't we split up.

389
00:35:14,499 --> 00:35:16,612
I'll go here, you go there.

390
00:35:58,455 --> 00:36:00,847
Gentlemen, could you watch
the food for a while, please?

391
00:36:00,856 --> 00:36:02,568
- No problem.
- Thank you.

392
00:36:08,095 --> 00:36:10,207
- Now you deal five cards.
- Play!

393
00:36:10,215 --> 00:36:12,259
Why did the French erect
the Eiffel tower?

394
00:36:12,317 --> 00:36:14,264
So the Germans could
see the white flag.

395
00:36:14,534 --> 00:36:16,886
Gentlemen, have you seen
the guy on duty here?

396
00:36:16,934 --> 00:36:19,206
When a guy's gotta go,
he's gotta go.

397
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:23,686
But we're not going anywhere.

398
00:37:10,449 --> 00:37:13,282
Easy, when they start, we run.

399
00:37:53,007 --> 00:37:54,646
You want to be treated like a soldier?

400
00:37:54,647 --> 00:37:58,718
- But, sir...
- Did you have a replacement on duty?

401
00:37:58,726 --> 00:38:01,038
Then why was nobody watching it?

402
00:38:02,286 --> 00:38:03,958
I thought you were grown up.

403
00:38:04,286 --> 00:38:05,878
Well?

404
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:09,677
You want to play war?

405
00:38:12,445 --> 00:38:14,077
Like we're pretend-dying?

406
00:38:16,684 --> 00:38:18,076
Then let's play!

407
00:38:18,925 --> 00:38:21,676
I'll go wake up those in coffins!

408
00:38:25,324 --> 00:38:26,476
At ease!

409
00:38:29,924 --> 00:38:31,076
Stefan, attention!

410
00:38:34,004 --> 00:38:35,036
Your punishment...

411
00:38:35,404 --> 00:38:37,835
You had it too easy,
so now you'll wash dishes.

412
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:39,835
Goral, come on...

413
00:38:55,641 --> 00:38:57,435
Grab him by the legs!

414
00:38:58,042 --> 00:38:59,474
By the legs.

415
00:39:03,242 --> 00:39:04,633
Attention!

416
00:39:07,961 --> 00:39:09,193
At ease.

417
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:16,912
Who thought the uprising
would last three days...

418
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:19,312
...was wrong.

419
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:23,112
We're going to enjoy it
a few days more.

420
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:26,311
The Germans got reinforcements.

421
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,271
We expect an assault at any point.

422
00:39:29,439 --> 00:39:30,831
There's an order

423
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,271
to move the arm band
from left to right!

424
00:39:37,239 --> 00:39:38,951
Everyone take your positions.

425
00:39:40,799 --> 00:39:43,950
You'll finish your soup later,
it's better not to eat now.

426
00:39:46,358 --> 00:39:47,629
Sir,

427
00:39:47,878 --> 00:39:50,230
do we know what's happening
on the other side of the wall?

428
00:39:50,318 --> 00:39:52,150
Do we have any units there?

429
00:39:55,358 --> 00:39:58,189
- My mother lives there.
- Everyone's got someone.

430
00:39:58,437 --> 00:40:01,196
You, focus on your dishes.
We'll do the shooting.

431
00:40:01,197 --> 00:40:04,468
Easy. I have no people and
he's playing with pots and pans?

432
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:08,589
- Give him some toy, he'll join us.
- What do I give him?

433
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:11,828
- I don't have a gun.
- He'll take a gun from the Germans.

434
00:40:13,196 --> 00:40:14,308
Come.

435
00:40:14,836 --> 00:40:15,988
Michal!

436
00:40:16,916 --> 00:40:18,028
Ready?

437
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:20,068
See the tree?

438
00:40:20,915 --> 00:40:22,027
Uh-huh.

439
00:40:22,196 --> 00:40:24,067
Then climb as high as you can

440
00:40:24,076 --> 00:40:25,794
and give us a shout
when you see something.

441
00:40:25,795 --> 00:40:26,707
Yes, sir.

442
00:40:35,674 --> 00:40:37,506
- What am I supposed to do?
- Nothing.

443
00:40:37,593 --> 00:40:39,665
Watch the end of the uprising...

444
00:40:40,194 --> 00:40:41,805
What do you mean the end?

445
00:40:41,863 --> 00:40:44,512
The Germans have got
reinforcements.

446
00:40:44,513 --> 00:40:46,173
The Russians have
stopped their offensive

447
00:40:46,231 --> 00:40:47,912
and now they're just
waiting for us to die.

448
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:49,721
You thought someone
would help us?

449
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:51,483
Everyone cares about themselves.

450
00:40:53,153 --> 00:40:54,784
With the first chance...

451
00:41:02,192 --> 00:41:04,104
Attention!

452
00:41:08,631 --> 00:41:10,423
Don't fire without an order!

453
00:41:11,031 --> 00:41:12,343
Stop shooting!

454
00:41:23,590 --> 00:41:26,741
Where are you going?
Take positions, I said!

455
00:41:32,069 --> 00:41:33,422
Now! Fire!

456
00:42:05,267 --> 00:42:07,019
From left to right.

457
00:45:41,251 --> 00:45:42,762
You motherfuckers!

458
00:45:42,770 --> 00:45:44,523
What have you done to her?

459
00:46:31,127 --> 00:46:32,038
It's me.

460
00:46:33,287 --> 00:46:34,518
Look at me!

461
00:46:39,326 --> 00:46:40,917
He doesn't recognise us.

462
00:46:43,765 --> 00:46:45,443
Don't panic, he'll pull through.

463
00:46:45,444 --> 00:46:49,276
Pull through?
It's the end of the uprising for this guy.

464
00:46:50,164 --> 00:46:52,437
Lucky they've found him.

465
00:46:53,365 --> 00:46:56,436
Poor thing. How are you going
to stay here now?

466
00:46:58,403 --> 00:47:00,996
Get moving or the uprising will end.

467
00:47:02,764 --> 00:47:05,556
You're on guard duty here, mate.

468
00:47:07,763 --> 00:47:09,196
We're waiting.

469
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:26,475
- Got it?
- Yeah.

470
00:47:26,601 --> 00:47:29,041
It's just a scratch,
it's a waste of a bandage.

471
00:47:29,042 --> 00:47:32,554
- Relax. How old are you?
- I'll be sixteen in December.

472
00:47:33,201 --> 00:47:35,393
I think they're bombing the hospital.

473
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,513
I'll go!

474
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,632
Kama!
We have to report this.

475
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:44,672
So I'll report it.

476
00:47:56,719 --> 00:47:57,472
Excuse me.

477
00:48:06,879 --> 00:48:08,078
No pass. There's a briefing.

478
00:48:08,079 --> 00:48:10,391
- I want to report something.
- You have to wait.

479
00:48:11,598 --> 00:48:13,310
So there's only the sewers left.

480
00:48:13,517 --> 00:48:16,870
- Organise a sewers communication team.
- Yes, sir.

481
00:48:16,877 --> 00:48:19,789
We have to recognise the passages
to Zoliborz and the Centre.

482
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:21,462
You guard the Mostowski Palace.

483
00:48:21,521 --> 00:48:23,127
They'll attack you from Muranow.

484
00:48:24,637 --> 00:48:26,549
Sir, lost connection with HQ.

485
00:48:28,077 --> 00:48:30,988
- Any good news?
- Two German tanks destroyed.

486
00:48:31,036 --> 00:48:33,239
They're bombing the
hospital, Stefan's there.

487
00:48:33,297 --> 00:48:34,628
But we're going in soon.

488
00:48:34,716 --> 00:48:35,868
We must get him out.

489
00:48:36,076 --> 00:48:38,668
- Perhaps...
- Perhaps... we've got orders.

490
00:48:39,237 --> 00:48:40,228
Yes, sir.

491
00:48:43,636 --> 00:48:44,668
Please.

492
00:48:45,515 --> 00:48:48,388
- I have to go for him.
- Desertion is punishable by death!

493
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:53,387
Dismissed!

494
00:49:02,754 --> 00:49:04,186
Where's Ladybird?!

495
00:49:06,075 --> 00:49:09,186
Madam, I'm ready.
Can I get back there?

496
00:49:21,553 --> 00:49:23,265
Don't go there, miss.

497
00:49:27,793 --> 00:49:28,864
Stefan!

498
00:49:38,991 --> 00:49:40,423
Stefan!

499
00:50:17,109 --> 00:50:19,620
Let's get up together.
Hear me?

500
00:50:19,828 --> 00:50:21,540
Let's go.

501
00:50:23,627 --> 00:50:26,620
Come on, get up!
Hear me?

502
00:50:37,108 --> 00:50:39,705
People, help!
They're trapped in the basement!

503
00:50:39,706 --> 00:50:43,026
- Please help!
- Look, he hardly walks.

504
00:50:43,027 --> 00:50:46,218
He has two hands, two legs!
People, help!

505
00:51:03,464 --> 00:51:05,297
I'll be back in a minute, stay put.

506
00:51:07,744 --> 00:51:11,056
Come on everyone!
We've captured a German tank!

507
00:51:11,065 --> 00:51:14,016
A tank? But there's no turret.
No idea what it is.

508
00:51:20,983 --> 00:51:23,256
Excuse me, is there any vacancy?

509
00:51:30,183 --> 00:51:30,854
Maria!

510
00:51:31,143 --> 00:51:32,894
Let's look at the tank they've won!

511
00:51:32,942 --> 00:51:35,174
- I'm scared.
- There's nothing to be scared of.

512
00:51:35,262 --> 00:51:37,694
What is this flower?
For me?

513
00:51:59,341 --> 00:52:01,780
Just for one night!
Our home's burnt down!

514
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:06,179
It's just my brother and I!
We're not insurgents! I beg you!

515
00:52:06,180 --> 00:52:08,172
Try the sisters, miss.

516
00:52:08,180 --> 00:52:10,372
The convent is just over there.

517
00:52:10,619 --> 00:52:13,651
- But don't tell anyone else, please.
- Thank you.

518
00:53:51,212 --> 00:53:52,684
The tank has exploded.

519
00:53:58,132 --> 00:53:58,890
Excuse me.

520
00:53:58,891 --> 00:54:02,682
Have you seen a boy
with a bandaged chest?

521
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:14,282
Excuse me, I'm looking for
a girl in a dress, I took her picture?

522
00:54:26,289 --> 00:54:27,920
How could you!

523
00:54:27,968 --> 00:54:30,281
You can't just leave like that!
Understand?

524
00:54:30,289 --> 00:54:32,161
Don't you ever do that to me!

525
00:54:32,288 --> 00:54:33,840
How could you?!

526
00:54:35,329 --> 00:54:38,000
Don't ever leave me!

527
00:54:56,766 --> 00:54:58,118
These should fit.

528
00:54:58,127 --> 00:54:59,358
Thank you, Sister.

529
00:55:01,166 --> 00:55:02,677
God bless you.

530
00:55:03,246 --> 00:55:06,438
That's the thing, Sister.
Where is God?

531
00:55:07,046 --> 00:55:09,597
- Busy with something else?
- Why involve God in all of this?

532
00:55:09,886 --> 00:55:12,037
The Old Town will fall anyway.

533
00:55:12,046 --> 00:55:13,284
We need to run.

534
00:55:13,285 --> 00:55:14,197
Sure, but where?

535
00:55:14,206 --> 00:55:16,724
- To the centre.
- Why are you laughing?

536
00:55:16,725 --> 00:55:19,917
They say the centre is like in Paris.
Press, cinema...

537
00:55:21,004 --> 00:55:22,156
Yes, sir!

538
00:55:27,004 --> 00:55:28,156
At ease.

539
00:55:28,604 --> 00:55:31,116
We're retreating through the sewers.

540
00:55:32,004 --> 00:55:33,116
Only army.

541
00:55:54,082 --> 00:55:56,633
You'll have more strength, lieutenant.

542
00:55:56,642 --> 00:55:58,113
Captain.

543
00:55:58,122 --> 00:55:59,873
Do I really look that bad?

544
00:56:01,122 --> 00:56:02,673
Thank you.

545
00:56:03,481 --> 00:56:05,073
I'll take it with me.

546
00:56:06,401 --> 00:56:08,632
And where are you headed?

547
00:56:16,241 --> 00:56:18,272
You have a lovely smile, miss.

548
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,872
You should smile more often.

549
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:34,550
What about these people here?
The captain says they're staying?

550
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:36,231
We can't fit all in the sewers.

551
00:56:48,757 --> 00:56:49,909
No pass to anyone.

552
00:56:50,477 --> 00:56:52,829
Step back!

553
00:56:53,077 --> 00:56:55,109
- Excuse me.
- No pass.

554
00:56:55,318 --> 00:56:57,149
- Excuse me.
- That's an order.

555
00:56:57,917 --> 00:57:00,189
Please don't touch me.

556
00:57:00,997 --> 00:57:03,388
Lady, what are you pushing for?
Goddamn it!

557
00:57:03,676 --> 00:57:05,028
We're all waiting.

558
00:57:05,396 --> 00:57:07,395
Let us through,
we're from the detail!

559
00:57:07,396 --> 00:57:10,308
Everyone says that!
My son was from the detail, too!

560
00:57:11,076 --> 00:57:12,268
Don't touch me.

561
00:57:12,676 --> 00:57:15,947
Captain, it's me!

562
00:57:16,156 --> 00:57:18,947
From the detail in the convent!

563
00:57:20,915 --> 00:57:21,947
Easy now!

564
00:57:24,275 --> 00:57:25,234
With my brother.

565
00:57:25,235 --> 00:57:27,666
- With whom?
- With my brother. Can we go in?

566
00:57:31,514 --> 00:57:33,186
Let them pass.
He's wounded.

567
00:57:33,195 --> 00:57:35,427
Be careful.
They're shooting from above.

568
00:57:38,194 --> 00:57:39,386
It's quiet down there.

569
00:57:39,434 --> 00:57:40,826
You get out at Warecka street.

570
00:57:40,994 --> 00:57:41,825
Bottle.

571
00:57:47,153 --> 00:57:47,905
Go!

572
00:57:47,913 --> 00:57:48,824
Go!

573
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,105
Absolutely quiet.
Or I won't see you again.

574
00:57:52,592 --> 00:57:54,265
Thank you!

575
00:57:54,273 --> 00:57:57,824
Ask for Karol from Barry's group.
But you'll forget anyway.

576
00:58:21,111 --> 00:58:23,022
Do you intend to stay here, miss?

577
00:58:24,030 --> 00:58:25,422
Anyone else?

578
00:58:25,709 --> 00:58:27,062
Move on!

579
00:58:29,270 --> 00:58:31,901
- Where are we?
- Hush!

580
00:58:33,429 --> 00:58:34,821
Quiet!

581
00:58:47,788 --> 00:58:48,740
Stop.

582
00:58:55,188 --> 00:58:56,699
It's not here.

583
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:05,099
Where are we?

584
00:59:06,027 --> 00:59:07,499
I don't know. The Centre?

585
00:59:13,267 --> 00:59:16,218
- Grenade!
- Run!

586
01:00:15,381 --> 01:00:16,380
Great victory!

587
01:00:16,381 --> 01:00:19,300
The insurgents have taken
the Saint Cross church,

588
01:00:19,301 --> 01:00:24,933
the Nazi Gendarmerie
and Foreign Affairs HQ.

589
01:00:25,141 --> 01:00:27,619
We've released several dozen
civilian hostages...

590
01:00:27,620 --> 01:00:29,572
Some water, please.

591
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,132
From which detachment?

592
01:00:36,539 --> 01:00:38,651
Your quarters are very near.

593
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:40,012
- Ewa!
- Yes?

594
01:00:40,940 --> 01:00:43,171
- And them? Where to?
- To the bank.

595
01:00:43,699 --> 01:00:47,538
Unfortunately, German artillery
was shelling the Old Town all night.

596
01:00:47,539 --> 01:00:50,658
There are no untouched
buildings left there.

597
01:00:50,659 --> 01:00:52,530
Civilian traffic has died out.

598
01:00:52,698 --> 01:00:57,130
City centre citizens are asked
to offer all help

599
01:00:57,298 --> 01:01:00,170
to those evacuating from the Old Town.

600
01:01:03,617 --> 01:01:04,856
Great victory!

601
01:01:04,857 --> 01:01:07,649
The insurgents have taken
the Saint Cross church...

602
01:01:35,655 --> 01:01:37,887
- Look at them!
- Master race!

603
01:01:37,935 --> 01:01:40,566
Look at you now, murderers!

604
01:01:44,175 --> 01:01:45,846
- Dad, water!
- You, upstairs!

605
01:01:45,854 --> 01:01:48,566
- More towels!
- No, there! Wiktor, show them!

606
01:01:50,854 --> 01:01:52,206
Guys, this way.

607
01:01:53,054 --> 01:01:54,565
Stas, help them.

608
01:01:55,373 --> 01:01:59,206
You have to find yourselves some place.
Hear me?

609
01:03:40,006 --> 01:03:41,637
Move it, to the basement!

610
01:04:00,484 --> 01:04:02,476
- Stop!
- You're defending the motherfucker?!

611
01:04:07,323 --> 01:04:09,316
Let me in!

612
01:04:10,163 --> 01:04:12,835
I'm gonna kill the German rat!

613
01:04:17,842 --> 01:04:21,075
Press it here.
Stay with him, I'll get some help.

614
01:04:26,162 --> 01:04:27,513
Stop!

615
01:04:27,801 --> 01:04:30,673
Come on, run up the stairs!

616
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,231
What are you doing?!

617
01:04:55,479 --> 01:04:57,072
Press it!

618
01:04:58,319 --> 01:05:02,831
They murdered my wife!
My life!

619
01:05:07,358 --> 01:05:09,629
A doctor!

620
01:05:22,117 --> 01:05:25,948
Praised be the lord, Father!
Here comes the youth!

621
01:05:26,637 --> 01:05:30,116
- We're Cobra's detail!
- You're the guys from the Old Town!

622
01:05:30,117 --> 01:05:33,388
- Stuff of legends now!
- We gave the Germans a rough ride!

623
01:05:33,396 --> 01:05:34,395
Father, could you?

624
01:05:34,396 --> 01:05:37,428
- Can you get them married, please?
-You guys?

625
01:05:37,716 --> 01:05:40,875
No, not them!
To the altar!

626
01:05:40,876 --> 01:05:42,388
Let's go then!

627
01:05:46,036 --> 01:05:47,707
What are your names?

628
01:05:47,755 --> 01:05:50,387
- Franciszek.
- Beata.

629
01:05:50,395 --> 01:05:52,387
Give each other your right hands.

630
01:06:54,030 --> 01:06:56,302
May I have this dance, miss?

631
01:07:20,908 --> 01:07:26,420
As soon as it's possible,
we'll get out of the city.

632
01:07:28,067 --> 01:07:30,499
I've been asking around.

633
01:07:31,347 --> 01:07:35,779
We'll run as far away as we can
and nothing will split us up.

634
01:07:36,987 --> 01:07:38,818
Just you and me.

635
01:07:41,267 --> 01:07:43,245
That's the most important thing,

636
01:07:43,303 --> 01:07:45,836
for the two of us to
survive, isn't it?

637
01:07:48,465 --> 01:07:50,937
I want to continue living for you.

638
01:08:22,023 --> 01:08:25,062
Ladybird!
Come on, you gotta help me.

639
01:08:25,063 --> 01:08:26,422
- Where's Stefan?
- No idea!

640
01:08:26,423 --> 01:08:28,255
They're attacking now the city centre!

641
01:08:32,422 --> 01:08:34,733
You haven't seen Stefan?

642
01:08:35,022 --> 01:08:37,853
Have you seen Stefan?
The wounded one?

643
01:08:37,902 --> 01:08:41,821
I saw him talk to the insurgents
who got married yesterday.

644
01:08:41,822 --> 01:08:43,133
Nah, he wasn't there.

645
01:08:44,102 --> 01:08:46,380
I saw him carrying the wounded.

646
01:08:46,381 --> 01:08:48,620
He carried nobody,
he wasn't here at all.

647
01:08:48,621 --> 01:08:51,700
- What?
- Just kidding. I don't know him.

648
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,608
He was with the
Group "Radoslaw".

649
01:08:53,667 --> 01:08:55,459
I think they went to Czerniakow.

650
01:08:55,460 --> 01:08:58,012
You won't get
there without a pass.

651
01:09:13,259 --> 01:09:15,651
So why do want to get there?

652
01:09:16,339 --> 01:09:19,851
To your brother?
Can't he manage on his own?

653
01:09:46,817 --> 01:09:47,968
Get undressed.

654
01:10:17,694 --> 01:10:18,686
Excuse me!

655
01:10:21,094 --> 01:10:23,093
Back to your mummy!
Stop!

656
01:10:23,094 --> 01:10:25,406
- I have a pass...
- Me too!

657
01:10:25,413 --> 01:10:27,525
Stand back, now!
The line is closed.

658
01:10:27,573 --> 01:10:30,885
Stop! I told you, kid!
Are you deaf?!

659
01:10:31,332 --> 01:10:33,572
- But I've got letters to deliver!
- No way!

660
01:10:33,573 --> 01:10:35,812
Get out of here!
No pass!

661
01:10:35,812 --> 01:10:38,804
Tanks! Russians!

662
01:10:43,972 --> 01:10:45,604
Stop!!!

663
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:57,443
The Germans have blown up the bridge!

664
01:11:01,450 --> 01:11:03,003
They've cut us off.

665
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:08,682
No passage!

666
01:12:31,044 --> 01:12:32,755
What are you doing here?

667
01:12:32,843 --> 01:12:34,876
To the basement!
The line's closed.

668
01:12:35,843 --> 01:12:37,915
I don't care about your pass!
To the basement!

669
01:12:41,044 --> 01:12:43,594
Where are the guys from the centre?
I'm looking for my brother.

670
01:12:43,602 --> 01:12:45,275
No idea, really.

671
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:11,433
When Russians see a woman...

672
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:13,232
No place in here.

673
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:38,030
This is great.
Straight from my uncle in Karczew.

674
01:13:39,078 --> 01:13:41,470
Coffee from Kama!

675
01:13:44,437 --> 01:13:45,790
Poles!

676
01:13:48,198 --> 01:13:50,548
You stupid Poles!

677
01:13:52,597 --> 01:13:54,508
God damn Poles!

678
01:13:55,597 --> 01:13:58,588
We don't kill prisoners,
Mister German!

679
01:13:58,756 --> 01:14:00,229
See?

680
01:14:00,876 --> 01:14:03,916
It's because of you guys
that I can't stroke my sweetheart.

681
01:14:03,916 --> 01:14:06,868
You can stroke all right,
you just can't strangle.

682
01:14:08,636 --> 01:14:10,588
Haven't you seen a German?

683
01:14:12,676 --> 01:14:13,995
We'll exterminate you.

684
01:14:13,996 --> 01:14:16,627
Every single one of you.
No one will help you.

685
01:14:16,636 --> 01:14:20,068
Stupid Poles, no one gives a damn!

686
01:14:21,035 --> 01:14:24,466
Such a good looking guy
with a foul tongue.

687
01:14:29,354 --> 01:14:30,506
Captain...

688
01:14:34,353 --> 01:14:36,945
My men are at your service.

689
01:14:44,393 --> 01:14:45,745
These children?

690
01:14:47,432 --> 01:14:49,265
It's good they're not retired, right?

691
01:14:51,352 --> 01:14:54,192
These are Berling's men.
They're going with us

692
01:14:54,193 --> 01:14:57,265
to take No 1 Wilanowska Street,
reach the river.

693
01:14:57,552 --> 01:15:01,104
No one's gonna help you,
no one will miss you.

694
01:15:10,992 --> 01:15:12,623
Follow them, dismissed!

695
01:15:13,071 --> 01:15:14,543
Don't let yourselves get killed!

696
01:15:17,870 --> 01:15:19,022
Leave this scrap here.

697
01:15:21,509 --> 01:15:22,462
Take this.

698
01:15:31,909 --> 01:15:34,181
They say the Russians
have crossed the river!

699
01:15:34,589 --> 01:15:38,101
What Russians! It's Poles.
General Berling's people.

700
01:15:39,388 --> 01:15:42,141
Berling is a traitor.
A deserter who joined the Russians.

701
01:15:43,228 --> 01:15:46,347
Who knows what he's actually done.
So cut that crap!

702
01:15:46,348 --> 01:15:49,747
How could they help?
A bunch of country boys!

703
01:15:49,748 --> 01:15:51,740
Can't you calm your kid down, lady?

704
01:16:13,386 --> 01:16:15,978
God almighty!
May these be Russians.

705
01:16:17,946 --> 01:16:21,418
Let's just get out and surrender.

706
01:16:24,986 --> 01:16:26,697
We'll walk out with the little one...

707
01:16:39,864 --> 01:16:41,377
It's the Russians, I think.

708
01:16:42,744 --> 01:16:43,896
We've made it!

709
01:16:49,144 --> 01:16:50,615
God, save me!

710
01:17:08,102 --> 01:17:10,693
Next basement!

711
01:17:12,661 --> 01:17:14,853
What are you doing?

712
01:17:15,061 --> 01:17:16,294
The child!

713
01:17:24,540 --> 01:17:26,332
A small baby!

714
01:17:26,460 --> 01:17:27,860
Something's wrong with it.

715
01:17:27,861 --> 01:17:31,012
To the hospital!
It's over there!

716
01:17:48,658 --> 01:17:50,890
Can anyone come here?

717
01:17:51,459 --> 01:17:54,690
- Can you please have a look?
- Can't you see I'm busy?

718
01:17:55,658 --> 01:17:57,010
Doctor...

719
01:18:01,457 --> 01:18:03,489
- Doctor!
- You need to wait.

720
01:18:04,257 --> 01:18:07,609
- Look at this kid, this instant!
- Sister!

721
01:18:09,177 --> 01:18:10,729
You think you're the priority?

722
01:18:10,737 --> 01:18:12,889
It's only me here,
I haven't slept in a week,

723
01:18:12,897 --> 01:18:17,008
I have some students to assist me,
all of them passing out all the time.

724
01:18:17,057 --> 01:18:19,488
Lusia!
This kid is dead!

725
01:18:20,455 --> 01:18:21,688
Your daughter?

726
01:18:22,776 --> 01:18:24,248
Right...

727
01:18:24,696 --> 01:18:26,088
Some water?

728
01:18:33,216 --> 01:18:34,327
People!

729
01:19:01,813 --> 01:19:04,444
Please help him!
He's just a kid!

730
01:19:07,132 --> 01:19:08,245
Excuse me!

731
01:19:13,372 --> 01:19:14,964
Pass it, please?

732
01:19:31,611 --> 01:19:34,203
They're hiding
in the upstairs windows.

733
01:19:34,851 --> 01:19:36,003
At your orders.

734
01:19:37,610 --> 01:19:39,282
The bastards are playing tango!

735
01:19:39,290 --> 01:19:40,242
Get ready to move!

736
01:19:40,250 --> 01:19:41,882
Patrol, follow me!

737
01:20:12,727 --> 01:20:15,599
It's such a pity - such a beautiful town.

738
01:20:15,807 --> 01:20:17,359
Your first time in Warsaw?

739
01:20:18,486 --> 01:20:20,999
First time in any city.

740
01:20:21,326 --> 01:20:23,445
But wherever you are you
fight the same way.

741
01:20:23,446 --> 01:20:25,558
- And how is that?
- The Polish way.

742
01:20:29,326 --> 01:20:31,198
No wonder your uprising
is going nowhere.

743
01:20:31,405 --> 01:20:33,316
Go back, guys, you
don't know the area.

744
01:20:33,375 --> 01:20:35,085
You've never seen a real battle.

745
01:20:35,086 --> 01:20:37,557
- Detail!
- It's different fighting in a city!

746
01:21:01,724 --> 01:21:03,995
Stay there! Stay!
Don't lean out!

747
01:21:05,443 --> 01:21:07,276
Stay there!

748
01:21:12,203 --> 01:21:13,794
I said stay!

749
01:21:17,482 --> 01:21:18,874
I got hit!

750
01:21:22,241 --> 01:21:26,753
Mum! Help me!
Don't leave me, guys!

751
01:21:27,281 --> 01:21:29,473
Don't leave me!

752
01:21:33,081 --> 01:21:34,913
Stop!
Cover him!

753
01:21:44,720 --> 01:21:46,352
Let's regroup!
To the gate!

754
01:21:47,760 --> 01:21:49,431
Rogal!

755
01:21:53,319 --> 01:21:55,671
Give me a hand!
Let's take him.

756
01:21:56,799 --> 01:21:58,838
Shit, thank you very much
for such help!

757
01:21:58,839 --> 01:22:00,111
He got shot in the heart.

758
01:22:00,759 --> 01:22:03,271
We're pretty good
at getting killed ourselves!

759
01:22:03,278 --> 01:22:04,470
Goral, the scouts!

760
01:22:04,878 --> 01:22:06,146
Be prepared! We can't pass.

761
01:22:06,204 --> 01:22:08,117
We'll wait till night
in this house.

762
01:22:08,118 --> 01:22:09,433
Gentlemen, get back!

763
01:22:09,491 --> 01:22:12,448
At dawn we'll go
through the basements.

764
01:22:12,557 --> 01:22:14,270
Take him!

765
01:22:24,517 --> 01:22:25,668
What are you doing?

766
01:22:28,596 --> 01:22:29,988
The VIS is mine.

767
01:25:57,260 --> 01:25:59,212
I'm not armed.

768
01:27:03,215 --> 01:27:04,927
A long time ago

769
01:27:05,615 --> 01:27:07,453
over a hill and far away

770
01:27:07,454 --> 01:27:09,293
there was a town.

771
01:27:09,294 --> 01:27:12,606
In this town there lived a boy.

772
01:27:12,614 --> 01:27:14,452
He had a family,

773
01:27:14,453 --> 01:27:16,445
he had many friends.

774
01:27:16,454 --> 01:27:17,926
Clear!

775
01:27:18,014 --> 01:27:19,525
They played together.

776
01:27:19,534 --> 01:27:23,885
They danced, went for walks,
they learned together.

777
01:27:23,893 --> 01:27:24,805
One day

778
01:27:24,814 --> 01:27:30,286
a bad king who wanted
to rule the whole world

779
01:27:30,372 --> 01:27:32,005
invaded their country

780
01:27:33,853 --> 01:27:35,212
and said:

781
01:27:35,212 --> 01:27:36,844
"I forbid you everything!

782
01:27:36,852 --> 01:27:38,524
I forbid you to play,

783
01:27:38,532 --> 01:27:40,331
I forbid you to learn,

784
01:27:40,332 --> 01:27:41,771
You're not allowed to do anything!"

785
01:27:41,772 --> 01:27:44,092
But he couldn't forbid them
to do one thing.

786
01:27:44,092 --> 01:27:49,523
To dream about the day
when they will regain their freedom.

787
01:27:51,851 --> 01:27:52,810
Get packed.

788
01:27:52,811 --> 01:27:54,683
- Get the boys.
- Now?

789
01:27:57,330 --> 01:27:59,249
- What's happening?
- So much for our help!

790
01:27:59,250 --> 01:28:02,323
They said they'd prepare 100 dinghies,
twenty people each.

791
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:04,243
But only for the soldiers.

792
01:28:04,810 --> 01:28:07,323
You help me get there.

793
01:28:07,810 --> 01:28:10,641
Don't be sad.
It breaks my heart.

794
01:28:19,850 --> 01:28:20,768
Ladybird,

795
01:28:20,769 --> 01:28:24,321
run to the HQ,
there must be some wounded there.

796
01:28:25,208 --> 01:28:26,887
I'll stay with this man.

797
01:28:26,888 --> 01:28:28,160
Poles!

798
01:28:28,248 --> 01:28:30,888
The Russians and the Allies
have deserted you.

799
01:28:30,889 --> 01:28:32,526
You have proven your valour!

800
01:28:32,527 --> 01:28:36,559
End this futile uprising
and surrender.

801
01:28:37,287 --> 01:28:39,720
Following General von dem Bach's order,

802
01:28:39,727 --> 01:28:43,039
nobody who surrenders will be harmed
in any way.

803
01:28:43,326 --> 01:28:46,320
This applies both to your soldiers
and civilians.

804
01:28:46,686 --> 01:28:48,006
We promise this to you.

805
01:28:48,007 --> 01:28:51,534
The German troops in Czerniakow

806
01:28:51,593 --> 01:28:55,575
from noon until 1
will cease fire

807
01:28:55,646 --> 01:29:00,444
so that those not fighting
and the wounded in hospitals

808
01:29:00,445 --> 01:29:04,957
have a chance to safely leave the town.

809
01:29:05,165 --> 01:29:08,125
It is up to you, members of the Home Army,

810
01:29:08,126 --> 01:29:11,442
whether you choose to cease fire

811
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:14,814
to save your own Polish blood.

812
01:29:15,125 --> 01:29:17,408
If you put down your arms

813
01:29:17,467 --> 01:29:21,574
we guarantee you your
life, work and bread.

814
01:29:22,125 --> 01:29:26,366
Citizens presenting
white scarves,

815
01:29:26,425 --> 01:29:29,395
I repeat, white scarves,

816
01:29:29,443 --> 01:29:32,312
may leave the endangered areas

817
01:29:32,371 --> 01:29:36,292
and head for safety
with German troops.

818
01:29:36,844 --> 01:29:43,514
Otherwise our troops
will be forced to destroy you,

819
01:29:43,563 --> 01:29:46,474
which will lead to
a large number of casualties.

820
01:29:46,683 --> 01:29:49,852
Have mercy on the
city's inhabitants.

821
01:29:49,911 --> 01:29:52,412
You have mercy, bastards!

822
01:29:53,122 --> 01:29:54,834
They're sending envoys.

823
01:29:58,241 --> 01:30:00,314
But now?!
Wonder what for?

824
01:30:16,320 --> 01:30:17,872
I solemnly swear

825
01:30:19,599 --> 01:30:21,192
I solemnly swear to you

826
01:30:23,679 --> 01:30:25,678
that I'll kill anyone

827
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:28,351
who mentions
the word "surrender".

828
01:30:30,198 --> 01:30:31,550
Got it?

829
01:30:40,318 --> 01:30:42,398
Let us evacuate the hospital.

830
01:30:42,457 --> 01:30:44,836
We have no personnel, nor space.

831
01:30:44,837 --> 01:30:47,152
Go back to the hospital, miss...

832
01:30:47,211 --> 01:30:50,116
There are children
dying of thirst!

833
01:30:50,117 --> 01:30:51,796
Evacuate where?

834
01:30:51,797 --> 01:30:54,676
They're going to kill us all,
can't you get it?

835
01:30:54,676 --> 01:30:57,468
- To the other side.
- How, on a bicycle?

836
01:30:57,477 --> 01:30:58,989
Dinghies.

837
01:30:58,996 --> 01:31:01,748
- Please.
- Please leave!

838
01:31:07,796 --> 01:31:08,868
Commander...

839
01:31:11,356 --> 01:31:13,188
Nobody here wants to surrender.

840
01:31:14,036 --> 01:31:17,707
Let the hospital evacuate.
We're staying here to the end.

841
01:31:22,194 --> 01:31:24,994
The cease-fire ends in two minutes!

842
01:31:24,995 --> 01:31:26,746
Hurry up, people!

843
01:31:28,714 --> 01:31:29,907
There's no more time.

844
01:31:30,393 --> 01:31:32,946
Let the wounded through.

845
01:31:33,075 --> 01:31:35,146
I feel sorry for you boys.

846
01:31:40,433 --> 01:31:42,865
They've knocked down the whole city.

847
01:31:43,073 --> 01:31:44,752
Stop pushing.

848
01:31:44,753 --> 01:31:47,185
Hurry up, people!
Cease-fire's about to end.

849
01:31:48,192 --> 01:31:49,825
Our people, back to the quarters!

850
01:31:59,032 --> 01:32:00,390
Lusia!

851
01:32:00,391 --> 01:32:03,423
Take her, I'll be back in a sec.

852
01:32:03,511 --> 01:32:06,304
Ladybird, the cease-fire ends
in a moment!

853
01:32:15,951 --> 01:32:18,263
Back together, like sisters, eh?

854
01:32:21,110 --> 01:32:23,822
It will all go back to normal soon?

855
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:27,701
And the likes of you will end up
with the likes of him...

856
01:32:27,709 --> 01:32:30,381
and the likes of me
will serve you coffee in cafés.

857
01:32:32,749 --> 01:32:34,461
You're a nobody,

858
01:32:35,989 --> 01:32:38,432
a common whore who
left her detail behind

859
01:32:38,491 --> 01:32:40,118
to protect your pretty ass.

860
01:32:42,828 --> 01:32:44,301
I hate you.

861
01:32:49,187 --> 01:32:51,940
Everyone to the house.
The firing starts in a minute!

862
01:32:57,467 --> 01:32:58,659
Success?

863
01:32:58,747 --> 01:33:01,300
What are you asking about, exactly?
Got some water?

864
01:33:05,027 --> 01:33:08,019
Black, the evacuation
of the hospital is complete.

865
01:33:08,026 --> 01:33:10,858
The personnel and the patients
are now by the river.

866
01:33:11,466 --> 01:33:14,545
Good. And now we need
the bloody dinghies to show up.

867
01:33:14,546 --> 01:33:16,138
The red armada!

868
01:33:27,584 --> 01:33:29,576
The others are by the river! Come!

869
01:33:29,705 --> 01:33:31,337
Get out of here!

870
01:33:31,544 --> 01:33:32,257
Get up!

871
01:33:32,264 --> 01:33:33,296
Beata!

872
01:33:33,464 --> 01:33:35,816
I'm staying!

873
01:33:37,344 --> 01:33:40,416
Take off that armband
of his at least, miss.

874
01:33:41,144 --> 01:33:43,232
When they find us,
they'll kill us.

875
01:33:43,291 --> 01:33:44,913
Leave me alone. Please.

876
01:33:45,263 --> 01:33:46,495
Please.

877
01:34:05,462 --> 01:34:07,013
Leave me alone!

878
01:34:08,022 --> 01:34:09,413
I'm telling ya!

879
01:34:10,541 --> 01:34:12,293
Go.

880
01:34:12,821 --> 01:34:15,253
- Don't leave me alone!
- Go.

881
01:34:15,941 --> 01:34:17,572
I love you!

882
01:34:24,100 --> 01:34:29,612
Don't hide, you're all gonna die.
I'll tell them who you are anyway.

883
01:34:36,860 --> 01:34:39,052
- Is it over?
- All clear.

884
01:34:39,459 --> 01:34:42,451
No, it's just begun!
Gentlemen, let's go!

885
01:34:46,859 --> 01:34:48,331
Move it!
Go, go!

886
01:35:16,176 --> 01:35:18,928
- Some candy, here!
- What about the dinghies?

887
01:35:19,153 --> 01:35:20,766
What dinghies!?
We're staying here anyway.

888
01:35:29,016 --> 01:35:29,847
Don't shoot.

889
01:35:30,535 --> 01:35:33,207
Don't shoot, I'm German.

890
01:35:34,935 --> 01:35:37,566
Johann Krauss,
the 2nd unit of the Wachtregiment.

891
01:35:43,294 --> 01:35:44,791
The Poles have looked
after me well,

892
01:35:44,850 --> 01:35:46,144
they didn't harm me in any way.

893
01:35:50,974 --> 01:35:52,445
Am I hurting any of them?

894
01:35:56,974 --> 01:36:00,005
All I'm asking is whether
there are any bandits here.

895
01:36:03,172 --> 01:36:04,924
You? You're a bandit?

896
01:36:07,652 --> 01:36:10,604
I am an old bandit!

897
01:36:12,452 --> 01:36:14,603
I've been married twice!

898
01:36:20,092 --> 01:36:22,204
Shut your mug and get the hell out!

899
01:36:32,131 --> 01:36:33,090
A goliath!

900
01:36:33,091 --> 01:36:35,722
Shoot at the cable, guys!
Get the PIAT ready.

901
01:36:48,409 --> 01:36:50,241
Miki, no way!
Spider, the PIAT!

902
01:37:20,246 --> 01:37:23,838
The Warsaw men are nice guys!

903
01:37:25,646 --> 01:37:26,558
Spider!

904
01:37:30,725 --> 01:37:31,678
They're coming!

905
01:37:41,685 --> 01:37:42,877
Grenade!

906
01:37:52,204 --> 01:37:53,356
Grenade!

907
01:37:56,964 --> 01:37:58,475
Ammo!

908
01:38:00,884 --> 01:38:02,435
Ammo!

909
01:38:10,482 --> 01:38:11,361
Grenade!

910
01:38:11,362 --> 01:38:12,834
Weapon!

911
01:38:13,043 --> 01:38:14,194
Ammo!

912
01:38:15,963 --> 01:38:17,794
Man, what's the matter?!

913
01:38:23,241 --> 01:38:24,993
On the right!

914
01:38:32,001 --> 01:38:34,480
- Ammo!
- There's none left.

915
01:38:34,481 --> 01:38:36,080
Give me some weapon!

916
01:38:36,081 --> 01:38:39,032
- We've none left!
- Damn it!

917
01:38:40,159 --> 01:38:42,032
Anything!

918
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:44,832
There's none left!

919
01:38:50,399 --> 01:38:53,952
- Everyone to the right!
- Ewa, grenades!

920
01:38:58,719 --> 01:39:00,791
A cannon!
Everybody get down!

921
01:39:18,997 --> 01:39:20,668
Ewa!

922
01:39:56,354 --> 01:39:59,192
We have to retreat! A Panther...

923
01:39:59,193 --> 01:40:00,986
Retreat!

924
01:40:15,193 --> 01:40:16,585
The last one.

925
01:40:20,713 --> 01:40:22,464
What are you wearing?
Take that off!

926
01:40:23,912 --> 01:40:27,064
You wanna surrender?
Why did you put it on?

927
01:40:29,472 --> 01:40:31,704
Go on! Shoot!

928
01:40:31,752 --> 01:40:33,144
What was all this for?

929
01:40:33,311 --> 01:40:36,342
- Huh?
- I don't want to die! Understand?!

930
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:42,263
What's going on here?

931
01:40:42,551 --> 01:40:46,582
- Give the VIS back!
- Calm down, man! The VIS!

932
01:40:50,990 --> 01:40:53,662
There are two rounds left.
Pull yourself together!

933
01:40:57,550 --> 01:40:59,141
Don't you lose it, miss!

934
01:40:59,830 --> 01:41:01,341
Move it, move it!

935
01:41:12,308 --> 01:41:14,420
We've got to get through
to the river!

936
01:41:18,788 --> 01:41:21,220
I'll lead you out, I swear.

937
01:41:22,667 --> 01:41:24,580
I'll lead you out, I swear, get up!

938
01:41:24,667 --> 01:41:26,499
Miki, get up!

939
01:41:26,788 --> 01:41:28,819
Get up! I'll lead you out!

940
01:41:31,306 --> 01:41:33,099
Crybaby!

941
01:41:37,346 --> 01:41:38,658
Goral!

942
01:41:39,546 --> 01:41:41,378
I've left the helmet.

943
01:41:45,666 --> 01:41:46,577
Let's go.

944
01:41:47,385 --> 01:41:50,537
Move forward.
Go on!

945
01:41:52,706 --> 01:41:53,777
Krauts!

946
01:43:34,337 --> 01:43:36,809
Now just to reach the river!

947
01:44:34,972 --> 01:44:36,484
Let's get to the river, please.

948
01:44:41,252 --> 01:44:42,244
Get up.

949
01:44:42,972 --> 01:44:44,124
Come on, get up!

950
01:44:47,611 --> 01:44:48,964
I'm sorry.

951
01:44:51,011 --> 01:44:52,803
For what?

952
01:44:53,092 --> 01:44:55,084
- Sorry!
- Stop it!

953
01:44:59,091 --> 01:45:00,723
I'm sorry.

954
01:45:01,891 --> 01:45:02,962
Get up!

955
01:45:06,170 --> 01:45:08,321
She stayed at the hospital.

956
01:45:31,009 --> 01:45:32,040
Stefan, run!

957
01:45:33,207 --> 01:45:34,920
Hey, gentlemen!

958
01:45:35,328 --> 01:45:36,479
I'm here!

959
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:38,766
You're all invited to my birthday!

960
01:45:38,767 --> 01:45:42,879
I turned 19 a few hours ago,
seriously!

961
01:45:45,048 --> 01:45:47,478
I never thought
this would be how I spend it!

962
01:45:53,446 --> 01:45:55,278
You're such idiots!

963
01:45:57,006 --> 01:46:00,437
You can't kill everybody, suckers,
it's just impossible.

964
01:46:02,525 --> 01:46:03,797
I feel sorry for you!

965
01:46:06,485 --> 01:46:08,797
The world will remember you for it,
forever!

966
01:46:10,365 --> 01:46:11,956
Stefan, run!

967
01:46:15,164 --> 01:46:16,956
Why aren't you hitting harder?!

968
01:46:20,324 --> 01:46:23,277
Long live freedom, you motherfuckers!

969
01:47:03,200 --> 01:47:05,912
Hush, hush...

970
01:49:57,707 --> 01:49:59,499
What have we got here?

971
01:50:35,785 --> 01:50:36,936
All clear!
