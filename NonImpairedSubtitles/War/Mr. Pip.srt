00:27:29,398 --> 00:27:31,571
Thank you, Mr Watts.

318
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:35,822
I am here today
hoping to surprise you kids.

319
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:40,326
What if I tell you that some gardens
begin their life in the ocean?

320
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:46,423
The heart seed ﬂoats on the water,
then it washes up on the sand.

321
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:53,389
Seven days later, the sun and the wind
dry it as light as the husk.

322
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:57,430
Three months later,
a little seedling grows,

323
00:27:57,551 --> 00:28:02,603
its white flowers open and look back
to the sea where it came from.

324
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:05,351
Why am I telling you this, children?

325
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:10,026
Because its stamen makes a fierce flame
and keeps away the mosquitos.

326
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,575
Right. Mrs Tanganani, the heart seed.

327

that they are not in the sea

338
00:28:53,065 --> 00:28:54,988

339

Stay away from boys who abuse silence.

344
00:29:14,086 --> 00:29:19,263
Other than that, I don't want to
tell you girls where to shop.

345
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:25,561
To kill a pig, you get two fat uncles to
hold it down and whack it on the chest.

346
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:27,558
How big do these uncles have to be?

347
00:29:30,477 --> 00:29:34,527
Fat ones. Fat is good.
Skinny is no bloody good.

01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:24,856
None greater than
when she gave me a child.

637
01:01:27,017 --> 01:01:31,067
A baby girl to whom
we gave the name Sarah.

638
01:01:34,274 --> 01:01:38,029
And we couldn't stop looking at her.

639
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:45,708
We had a room in the middle
of the house, between us, for Sarah.

640
01:01:45,827 --> 01:01:50,628
We filled this room with our thoughts,
our memories, our histories,

641
01:01:50,749 --> 01:01:53,923
which we'd take it in turns
to write it on the wall.

642
01:01:54,044 --> 01:01:58,174
And Grace traced Sarah's lineage

643
01:01:58,298 --> 01:02:04,556
from her all the way back
to a ﬂying fish.

644
01:02:04,679 --> 01:02:08,775
Was I on this wall?

645
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:15,531
Uh, yes, I believe you were.

646
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:27,168
Sarah fell to meningitis
before herfirst birthday.

647
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:32,711
<i>Grief...</i>

648
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:38,096
(Breathes heavily)

649
01:02:38,213 --> 01:02:42,263
Grace couldn't...
she couldn't move, didn't speak.

650
01:02:42,384 --> 01:02:44,637
She never left her bed.

651
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:50,393
And I tried... I...

652
01:02:50,517 --> 01:02:54,613
We moved homes, we moved countries.

653
01:02:56,648 --> 01:03:03,281
Finally, I thought that the best way
would be for Grace to reinvent herself.

654
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:09,791
I don't know how many of you here know
who the Queen of Sheba was.

655
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:16,134
It's in the Bible.

656
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:19,596
The Queen of Sheba
was a very wise black woman

657
01:03:19,713 --> 01:03:25,345
who wanted to see if she could match
Solomon's legendary wisdom.

658
01:03:31,308 --> 01:03:36,109
And she communed with him
of all that was in her heart

659
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:39,233
and nothing was hid.

660
01:04:17,020 --> 01:04:18,567
(Door opens)

661
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:24,032
<i>We've all lost</i> a <i>lot in recent times.</i>

662
01:04:25,987 --> 01:04:31,244
And those losses,
I think we should use them...

663
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:40,382
...lo remind ourselves of the things
that we could never lose -

664
01:04:40,502 --> 01:04:44,507
our minds and our imaginations.

665
01:04:48,259 --> 01:04:51,058
Where are our imaginations?

666
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:55,900
Out there, and in here.

667
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:03,032
(Half-laughs)

668
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:06,528
Alright, let's try something different.
All of you close your eyes.

669
01:05:06,653 --> 01:05:12,786
Now, in a voice that only you can hear,
I want you to say your name.

670
01:05:14,244 --> 01:05:15,746
(Children murmur)

671
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:18,248
Just say it to yourself, everyone.

672
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:27,425
...

673
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:30,177
iii I:::I I fn ..

674
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:34,681
(Children murmur)

675
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:41,734
Now, no-one ever-
in the whole history of the world-

676
01:05:41,855 --> 01:05:46,702
no-one has ever used your voice
to say your name.

677
01:05:46,818 --> 01:05:51,415
It belongs to you.
Matilda Naimo. Matilda Naimo.

678
01:05:51,531 --> 01:05:54,580
<i>No-one can take that</i> away from <i>you.</i>

679
01:05:56,786 --> 01:06:03,510
When Mr Dickens sat down in 1860
and started to write Great Expectations,

680
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:07,506
the first thing he had to do was to
clear a space iorihe voice 01 Pip.

681
01:06:09,757 --> 01:06:12,681
And that is what my friend Matilda
has done.

682
01:06:12,802 --> 01:06:15,555
She's started to write the story of Pip.

683
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:24,148
She has given us a special task,
a sacred task-

684
01:06:24,272 --> 01:06:29,153
we have to retrieve the story
of Great Expectations.

685
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:34,912
So, who's with me?

686
01:06:38,953 --> 01:06:43,675
Yes. Christopher.
Pip wanted to be a gentleman.

687
01:06:43,791 --> 01:06:46,260
Yes, he did.

688
01:06:46,377 --> 01:06:50,974
Can anyone be a gentleman?
Yes, they can.

689
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:53,684
Even a poor person?

690
01:06:57,555 --> 01:07:00,354
Absolutely a poor person
can be a gentleman.

691
01:07:03,603 --> 01:07:10,703
A gentleman... a gentleman is someone
who never forgets their manners,

692
01:07:10,818 --> 01:07:13,697
no matter what the situation is,

693
01:07:13,821 --> 01:07:18,327
no matter how terrible, how awful.

694
01:07:18,451 --> 01:07:22,797
Money and social standing
have got nothing to do with it.

695
01:07:22,914 --> 01:07:28,341
A gentleman always tries to do
the right thing.

696
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:36,974
Where have you been?
School, of course.

697
01:07:37,095 --> 01:07:39,894
What, with the dumb bugger, Pop-Eye?

698
01:07:41,975 --> 01:07:45,445
Mum, I know you talked Mr Watts
into coming back.

699
01:07:45,562 --> 01:07:49,408
(Both laugh)

700
01:07:49,524 --> 01:07:53,700
TOM: This will remove Pip
from the protective comfort of home

701
01:07:53,820 --> 01:07:56,573
to the unknown metropolis.

702
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:01,836
Metropolis. Uh... Alright.

703
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:04,832
Let's say that this here
is our little village.

704
01:08:04,956 --> 01:08:10,213
In Pip's time, greater London
would be this immense metropolis.

705
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:13,135
We've got a new roof on our place.

706
01:08:13,256 --> 01:08:15,600
(All laugh)

707
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:29,356
(Children laugh)

708
01:08:29,480 --> 01:08:32,780
(Street vendor calls out)

709
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,653
Tag! Can't catch me!

710
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:37,746
(Women converse)

711
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:43,957
Pip'

712
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:46,172
Iii: I I

713
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:53,425
Sorry, would you excuse us, Herbert?

714
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:57,554
What's wrong?
It's nothing.

715
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,928
I'm just... I'm running late for
a meeting with Miss Havisham.

716
01:09:00,053 --> 01:09:01,555
I'll walk with you.

717
01:09:01,679 --> 01:09:07,357
No, it's the young Miss Havisham,
Estella.

718
01:09:07,477 --> 01:09:10,947
Anyways, it was very nice to see you.

719
01:09:13,024 --> 01:09:15,447
Who was that, Handel?
Nobody.

720
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:17,991
MATILDA: His name is Pip.

721
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:22,583
Or have you abandoned that too,
along with Joe and everyone else?

722
01:09:25,536 --> 01:09:27,379
And you're so much better?

723
01:09:27,497 --> 01:09:31,218
I'm sorry, Matilda, but you have no idea
what is expected of a gentleman.

724
01:09:31,334 --> 01:09:35,259
I do. I just don't see one here.

725
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:59,787
Do you not <i>have</i> your own shadow
to play with?

726
01:09:59,904 --> 01:10:05,502
Shit. Matilda. What are you doing
creeping around here?

727
01:10:05,618 --> 01:10:10,749
What Estella says to Pip - do you not
have your own shadow to play with?

728
01:10:13,501 --> 01:10:17,881
Yes. Very good.

729
01:10:21,426 --> 01:10:23,804
Do you want to write this down?

730
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:37,992
Dxd Mrs Watts read Great Expectatxons?

731
01:10:38,109 --> 01:10:39,952
Grace?

732
01:10:42,447 --> 01:10:44,666
Sadly, no.

733
01:10:44,782 --> 01:10:46,830
She tried.

734
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:50,546
Till finally she said
that she would reach the end

735
01:10:50,663 --> 01:10:55,920
if I would do the same with the Bible,
and that was that.

736
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:01,633
The thing is, you can't really pretend
to read a book.

737
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:07,180
Your eyes will always give you away.
Your eyes and your breathing.

738
01:11:07,305 --> 01:11:12,027
The house could be on fire
and a reader deep in a book

739
01:11:12,143 --> 01:11:17,491
wouldn'l even notice
until the wallpaper was in ﬂames.

740
01:11:20,610 --> 01:11:26,538
And for me,
Great Expectations was such a book.

741
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:33,256
It <i>gave</i> me permission to...
change my life.

742
01:11:34,957 --> 01:11:37,005
Reinvent myself.

743
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:46,177
Matilda.

744
01:11:48,805 --> 01:11:53,436
There's a boat leaving
the night after the full moon.

745
01:11:54,644 --> 01:11:58,069
Gilbert's father could take us out
to meet it.

746
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:01,693
A few hours on the open sea
and you'd be in the Solomon Islands.

747
01:12:01,818 --> 01:12:04,742
And Australia?

748
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:08,583
Well, in the Solomons,
it'd be up to you.

749
01:12:14,288 --> 01:12:15,915
Your mum too, Matilda.

750
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,970
But it's very important that
you don't tell anyone about this,

751
01:12:21,087 --> 01:12:24,637
not even Dolores,
uniil I give the word.

752
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:27,385
Understand?

753
01:12:36,811 --> 01:12:38,484
(Whistling)

754
01:12:38,604 --> 01:12:40,606
(Dog barks in distance)

755
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,278
(People shout in distance)

756
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:45,028
(Whistling)
MAN: Hurry up! Go!

757
01:12:45,152 --> 01:12:49,123
(Gunfire)
(People scream)

758
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:51,789
(Soldiers shout)

759
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:57,460
(Soldier shouts commands)

760
01:13:09,635 --> 01:13:11,979
You. Move, move, move, move.

761
01:13:13,264 --> 01:13:14,982
Hey! (Shouts)

762
01:13:15,099 --> 01:13:18,023
(Soldier shouts in native tongue)

763
01:13:19,687 --> 01:13:22,110
SOLDIER: Move!
Move out, move out.

764
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:26,952
We need medicines.

765
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:32,166
What medicines we had, you burned.

766
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:38,582
Lasi time we were here, you were
concealing a man named Pip.

767
01:13:38,706 --> 01:13:42,677
Have you decided to hand him to me yet'?

768
01:13:53,512 --> 01:13:55,685
I thought not.

769
01:14:03,022 --> 01:14:05,150
Move'

770
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:08,452
Move'

771
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:22,046
I will ask you again for your name.

772
01:14:46,857 --> 01:14:51,863
My father's family name being Pi rrip,
and my Christian name Philip,

773
01:14:51,988 --> 01:14:53,956
my infant tongue
could make of both names

774
01:14:54,073 --> 01:14:56,542
nothing longer or more explicit
than Pip.

775
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:59,913
<i>So</i> I called myself Pip
and came to be called...

776
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:02,381
(Gunshot)
(All scream)

777
01:15:04,959 --> 01:15:08,259
SOLDIER: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!

778
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:11,056
(Gunshot)
(All scream)

779
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:12,766
SOLDIER: Hey, shut up!

780
01:15:12,883 --> 01:15:15,386
(Weeping)

781
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:18,060
I'm finished with being lied to.

782
01:15:33,571 --> 01:15:36,825
(Soldiers speak in naive tongue)

783
01:15:42,038 --> 01:15:44,632
(Speaks in native tongue)

784
01:15:49,795 --> 01:15:51,217
Move, move!

785
01:15:51,338 --> 01:15:53,636
(Pigs grunt, oink)

786
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:06,188
(Blades hack)
(People gasp, scream)

787
01:16:09,315 --> 01:16:11,363
(Pigs squeal, grunt)

788
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,574
(Sobs)

789
01:16:26,791 --> 01:16:29,419
(Soldiers laugh)

790
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:35,512
(Soldiers converse, laugh)

791
01:16:40,387 --> 01:16:42,606
(Laughs)

792
01:16:48,104 --> 01:16:49,731
Look up!

793
01:16:57,154 --> 01:17:00,078
Who saw this?
