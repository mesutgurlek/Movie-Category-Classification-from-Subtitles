Gypsum caves don't occur

01:08:02,582 --> 01:08:04,166
I saw everything that happened,

950
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:07,544
and it's almost
like I heard my mother

951
01:08:07,712 --> 01:08:10,130
speaking to me in my head.

952
01:08:13,510 --> 01:08:14,510
We didn't speak.

953
01:08:14,678 --> 01:08:16,553
We didn't tell people
too many times.

954
01:08:16,721 --> 01:08:21,517
If we spoke about the cave,
we spoke it amongst ourselves.

955
01:08:21,685 --> 01:08:25,229
We didn't tell it to others,
because it was just too incredible.

956
01:08:31,361 --> 01:08:34,989
CHRIS: It would be hard
for experienced cavers

957
01:08:35,156 --> 01:08:38,200
to endure a year underground...

958
01:08:38,368 --> 01:08:40,995
not just by the environmental
conditions,

959
01:08:41,162 --> 01:08:43,247
but also mental conditions.

960
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:49,295
They discovered one
of the longest caves in the world,

961
01:08:49,463 --> 01:08:53,675
and they broke the record
for uninterrupted, sustained survival.

962
01:08:54,593 --> 01:08:56,655
These were amateurs,

963
01:08:57,006 --> 01:09:02,045
that ranged in age
from 2 years old to 76.

964
01:09:02,476 --> 01:09:04,602
They went into the cave
not equipped,

965
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:06,604
but through trial and error,

966
01:09:06,772 --> 01:09:09,774
being able to think
out of the box,

967
01:09:09,942 --> 01:09:13,862
they turned themselves
into world-class cavers.

968
01:09:20,202 --> 01:09:22,037
We thought that getting
into Priest's Grotto

969
01:09:22,204 --> 01:09:23,913
might be too difficult for them.

970
01:09:24,790 --> 01:09:27,375
Sam is in his 80s,
and Saul is 91.

971
01:09:28,210 --> 01:09:29,210
But Sam insisted on trying.

972
01:09:29,378 --> 01:09:30,420
Okay.

973
01:09:30,588 --> 01:09:34,007
[ men conversing indistinctly ]

974
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:36,969
- Okay?
- We're doing good

975
01:09:37,137 --> 01:09:38,512
Okay?

976
01:09:47,105 --> 01:09:48,105
SAM: Yeah, listen,

977
01:09:48,273 --> 01:09:51,776
I'm very disappointed,
because I wanted to go in

978
01:09:51,943 --> 01:09:53,611
and be in the place
where we lived.

979
01:09:53,779 --> 01:09:56,363
Listen. Listen.
The Ukrainians will tell you

980
01:09:56,531 --> 01:09:58,199
there's something special
about this cave.

981
01:09:58,366 --> 01:10:00,076
Once you open the door,
you can feel something.

982
01:10:00,952 --> 01:10:02,870
The cave knows you
and your brother were here.

983
01:10:03,038 --> 01:10:04,663
- Oh, yeah, the cave knows!
- It knows.

984
01:10:04,831 --> 01:10:06,999
- Yeah, yeah.
- It knows.

985
01:10:12,964 --> 01:10:15,257
CHRIS: What did your mother write
in the beginning of the book?

986
01:10:15,425 --> 01:10:18,803
What did she write
about why she wrote the book?

987
01:10:18,970 --> 01:10:23,724
Because she wants
maybe someday grandchildren

988
01:10:23,892 --> 01:10:27,938
and great-grandchildren come
and to see what we went through.

989
01:10:28,106 --> 01:10:29,815
And who's standing
right alongside you?

990
01:10:29,982 --> 01:10:33,193
My granddaughter
and my brother's grandson.

991
01:11:02,932 --> 01:11:07,602
It was my first bedtime story...
everything about the cave.

992
01:11:17,781 --> 01:11:20,449
SAUL: My granddaughter...
she got out.

993
01:11:22,744 --> 01:11:25,288
Beautiful... a nice, tall girl.

994
01:11:25,455 --> 01:11:29,792
Said, "This is my granddaughter,
came to my cave. "

995
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:33,546
This was worth a million
to see that.

996
01:11:42,139 --> 01:11:44,432
The first day,
when I walked down,

997
01:11:44,600 --> 01:11:45,892
and I came, and I looked down.

998
01:11:46,059 --> 01:11:48,728
I could see it now,
the way it looked.

999
01:11:49,688 --> 01:11:51,522
CHRIS: Nice and slow, Saul.

1000
01:11:51,690 --> 01:11:56,319
Guiding Saul through
the passageways of Verteba

1001
01:11:56,486 --> 01:11:58,029
was quite an experience.

1002
01:11:59,448 --> 01:12:01,407
I felt like I'm going
back in time.

1003
01:12:01,575 --> 01:12:03,243
And in my mind,

1004
01:12:03,764 --> 01:12:09,287
I'm thinking that
he's seeing things

1005
01:12:10,293 --> 01:12:12,961
the same way he did 67 years ago.

1006
01:12:15,381 --> 01:12:16,632
You better watch my cave here.

1007
01:12:16,799 --> 01:12:18,091
Don't break nothing.

1008
01:12:18,927 --> 01:12:23,388
CHRIS: When it was Sam's turn,
his energy level was unbelievable.

1009
01:12:23,556 --> 01:12:24,556
SAM: Fine. I'm fine.

1010
01:12:24,724 --> 01:12:26,808
CHRIS:
He was so eager and energetic,

1011
01:12:26,976 --> 01:12:28,769
he was pulling me
through the cave.

1012
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:32,773
CHRIS: We're gonna continue
going straight.

1013
01:12:34,400 --> 01:12:36,401
When I went into Verteba...

1014
01:12:39,155 --> 01:12:42,324
I... I... I saw everything
in front of me.

1015
01:12:42,492 --> 01:12:43,617
I saw the people.

1016
01:12:43,785 --> 01:12:45,494
Look, this is where
they were cooking.

1017
01:12:45,662 --> 01:12:47,079
SONIA: And I was happy.

1018
01:12:47,247 --> 01:12:49,790
This is where they were cooking.

1019
01:12:49,958 --> 01:12:52,417
Look. Don't you see,
it's all smoke here?

1020
01:12:55,797 --> 01:12:57,339
SIMA:
When I was five years old,

1021
01:12:57,507 --> 01:13:00,426
one-third of my life
was spent in caves.

1022
01:13:01,804 --> 01:13:04,138
I think we slept here.

1023
01:13:04,306 --> 01:13:05,723
I think this is where we...

1024
01:13:06,558 --> 01:13:09,936
See, Sam?
When it gets dark...

1025
01:13:10,104 --> 01:13:12,063
- Yeah.
- and they put just a candle,

1026
01:13:12,231 --> 01:13:13,481
you're gonna see the same change.

1027

[ lights click off ]

1028
01:13:16,610 --> 01:13:18,319
SAUL:
Now I know where I am.

1029
01:13:21,991 --> 01:13:23,908
Let's close down the lights
for a minute.

1030
01:13:25,077 --> 01:13:27,787
Ahh. Now I feel good.

1031
01:13:32,626 --> 01:13:33,918
The cave was fighting for me.

1032
01:13:34,086 --> 01:13:36,921
I should be alive today.

1033
01:13:37,089 --> 01:13:38,381
Those stones...

1034
01:13:39,216 --> 01:13:41,467
Those stones put up a fight.

1035
01:13:43,053 --> 01:13:46,764
SONIA:
I was safe in the darkness.

1036
01:13:46,932 --> 01:13:50,811
I feel safety in the quietness,

1037
01:13:50,979 --> 01:13:53,063
and sometimes, you know,

1038
01:13:54,441 --> 01:13:57,985
you're still
the child that is in the Grotto.

1039
01:14:00,363 --> 01:14:02,031
SAM: The Russians...
they bombed the Germans,

1040
01:14:02,198 --> 01:14:03,699
so we stayed inside,

1041
01:14:05,493 --> 01:14:08,162
and we told this guy
that if the Russians come in,

1042
01:14:08,330 --> 01:14:10,956
he should put a note
and put it on a string

1043
01:14:11,124 --> 01:14:12,666
and put it down in the hole.

One day, I come out,
and there it is.

1046
01:14:25,013 --> 01:14:27,723
Oh, what a noise.

1047
01:14:27,891 --> 01:14:31,268
Everybody was yelling
and crying and...

1048
01:14:32,562 --> 01:14:34,605
and we were liberated.

You can't imagine this feeling,

01:14:41,321 --> 01:14:43,114
how beautiful it is outside.

1052
01:14:50,498 --> 01:14:52,749

Not one person came out
to greet us and say, "Hey. "

1058
01:16:27,346 --> 01:16:31,141
These were neighbors...
"We're so happy that you're alive. "

1059
01:16:36,105 --> 01:16:39,691
SAUL: And we had a dog
before we left,

1060
01:16:39,859 --> 01:16:41,860
a beautiful German shepherd.

1061

This dog, if he could say,
"Where have you been?"

and there aren't miracles.

Depends how you want to believe.

1064
01:16:52,914 --> 01:16:55,290
There had to be miracles for us.

1065
01:16:59,086 --> 01:17:00,837
CHRIS:
I feel like I did something good.

1066
01:17:01,672 --> 01:17:04,090
I went to Ukraine
looking for my family's story,

1067
01:17:05,384 --> 01:17:06,718
and I found someone else's.

1068
01:17:12,266 --> 01:17:15,811
We beat the odds,
and they didn't get us.

1069
01:17:17,147 --> 01:17:20,316
SAM: We are not heroes,
just survivors.

1070
01:17:20,484 --> 01:17:24,070
We fought.
We were fighters.

1071
01:17:25,864 --> 01:17:29,325
ESTHER: We were masters
of our own fate in the cave.

1072
01:17:29,493 --> 01:17:32,286
There was no one
to whom we owed our safety

1073
01:17:32,454 --> 01:17:34,789
or upon whom we depended.

1074
01:17:34,957 --> 01:17:37,083
After our men came in
from the outside

1075
01:17:37,251 --> 01:17:41,212
and scraped off the mud
which clung to their clothing,

1076
01:17:41,380 --> 01:17:43,589
they were free men.
