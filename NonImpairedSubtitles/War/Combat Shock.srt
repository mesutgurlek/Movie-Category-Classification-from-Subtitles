00:27:01,053 --> 00:27:02,088
FRANKIE (VOICEOVER):
I could never

168
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:03,856
Get the money he wants by then.

169
00:27:03,956 --> 00:27:06,392
And he knows that.

170
00:27:06,492 --> 00:27:10,797
He makes it impossible to
pay so he can destroy me.

171
00:27:10,897 --> 00:27:11,764
Well, we'll see, prick-o.

172
00:27:37,724 --> 00:28:15,427
But

173
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,429
[Baby crying]

174
00:28:38,617 --> 00:28:40,987
[Coughing]

175
00:29:26,899 --> 00:29:28,134
Don't move, or you're dead.

176
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,638
Frankie, I didn't
know it was you, man.

177
00:29:32,738 --> 00:29:33,940
Mike, what the
fuck were you doing?

178
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:35,007
Oh, man.
You gotta help me.

179
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:36,308
I need money bad.

180
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:37,609
- I don't have anything.
- Anything, man.

181
00:29:37,709 --> 00:29:38,444
You gotta have something.

182
00:29:38,544 --> 00:29:39,478
Man, I got nothing.

183
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:40,947
My fucking wife's
home waiting for me.

184
00:29:41,047 --> 00:29:41,814
She's starving.

185
00:29:41,914 --> 00:29:43,182
I feel like I'm gonna explode.

186
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:44,416
I can't take it anymore.

187
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:45,717
All right, take it easy, Mike.

188
00:29:45,818 --> 00:29:46,819
Come on, rest a little.
No, no.

189
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:47,653
I gotta move.

190
00:29:47,753 --> 00:29:49,588
It hurts less when I'm moving.

191
00:29:57,997 --> 00:29:58,865
That's right.

192
00:29:58,965 --> 00:29:59,832
Cough it out.

193
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:00,799
You'll be all right.

194
00:30:03,535 --> 00:30:04,270
I cough, man.

195
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,604
There's nothing in my system.

196
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:07,473
I haven't eaten in three days.

197
00:30:07,573 --> 00:30:08,941
Mike, I thought you
kicked that shit.

198
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:12,144
Yeah, tell me about...
Tell me about it.

199
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,679
Yeah, I know, but what
do you want me to say.

200
00:30:13,779 --> 00:30:14,780
I mean, look at you.

201
00:30:14,881 --> 00:30:16,082
Hey, look at you.

202
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:17,884
Who the fuck are you to be
telling people how to live?

203
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:19,251
Hey, look, do what
the fuck you want.

204
00:30:19,351 --> 00:30:20,186
You know, I personally
don't give a shit.

205
00:30:20,286 --> 00:30:20,987
Wait.

206
00:30:21,087 --> 00:30:23,122
I didn't mean that, man.

207
00:30:23,222 --> 00:30:24,123
I'm sorry.

208
00:30:24,223 --> 00:30:27,093
Let's walk.

209
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:28,394
Just do me a favor.

210
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:29,561
Don't pull any shit
with me around.

211
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,638
Have you seen Paco?

212
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,307
Yeah, I just saw him.

213
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:42,875
He's sure been looking for me.

214
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:43,910
He's looking for everybody.

215
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:45,211
He owns everybody.

216
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:47,947
At least his family does.

217
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:50,482
You know, he wouldn't be shit if
it wasn't for his brother, man.

218
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:52,518
That's the animal...
Animal to avoid.

219
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:53,752
I never met his brother.

220
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:54,786
Well, you're lucky.

221
00:30:54,887 --> 00:30:55,888
[Inaudible] fucking
time of day, man.

222
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:57,656
He's a real fuck, you know that?

223
00:30:57,756 --> 00:30:59,691
One time... one time this guy
was yelling at his brother, man.

224
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,427
I don't know, he got into
an accident or something,

225
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:02,594
Ran over his fucking toe.

226
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,395
Hey, wait.

227
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:04,796
There's somebody.

228
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:05,965
Hey, you want a
piece of this, man?

229
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:08,667
I'll split it with you.

230
00:31:08,767 --> 00:31:09,468
No, Mike.

231
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,469
I'll pass.

232
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:11,270
You sure?

233
00:31:14,106 --> 00:31:17,176
Mike, it's not the
way to do things.

234
00:31:17,276 --> 00:31:18,344
You're gonna wind up in jail.

235
00:31:18,444 --> 00:31:19,245
What choices do I have?

236
00:31:19,345 --> 00:31:20,212
I'll take my chances.

237
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,847
I need $100 a day to survive.

238
00:31:21,948 --> 00:31:23,215
Where am I gonna
get money like that?

239
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,850
You think I like doing this?

240
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:25,918
I'm better off in jail.

241
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:37,496
Mike, if I get any
money, I'll give you some.

242
00:32:02,054 --> 00:32:03,956
[Baby crying]

[Screaming]

244
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:24,896
FRANKIE (VOICEOVER):
Sometimes I feel

245
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:29,368
Like I'm oozing out of my
body, like I don't belong here.

246
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:32,538
And my mind forces
me somewhere else.

247
00:34:32,638 --> 00:34:36,508
I can't stop it because it's
so real that I believe it.

248
00:34:36,608 --> 00:34:37,809
I hear it.

249
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,611
I smell it.

250
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:40,679
I can see it.

251
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:18,384
It's so fucking cold.

252
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:20,886
Oh, god.

253
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:23,389
Now I know why they
didn't kill me.

254
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,362
Dead?

255
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,398
What... but what
about other people?

256
00:35:32,498 --> 00:35:34,032
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER):
There are no other people.

257
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:35,767
There's only room
for one at the top.

258
00:35:35,867 --> 00:35:38,270
You remember that.

259
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:39,471
YOUNGER FRANKIE
(VOICEOVER): I don't

260
00:35:39,571 --> 00:35:40,739
Know if I agree with that.

261
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:42,040
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER):
Well, you better

262
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,343
Agree with that, because
that's the way the world is.

263

YOUNGER FRANKIE (VOICEOVER):
But he's my friend.

OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER):
I don't care.

265
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:49,147
You're not to associate
with his kind anymore.

266
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:50,782
YOUNGER FRANKIE (VOICEOVER):
What's his kind?

267
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:51,617
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER):
Cut it out.

268
00:35:51,717 --> 00:35:52,618
You know what I'm talking about.

00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:53,452
YOUNGER FRANKIE
(VOICEOVER): You can't

270
00:35:53,552 --> 00:35:54,753
Judge everybody by their color.

271
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,087
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER): Now,
don't tell me how to live.

272
00:35:56,188 --> 00:35:57,823
You're not going to be seen
hanging around with niggers.

273
00:36:01,727 --> 00:36:03,462
And you're being pig-headed.

274
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:04,863
You could be set for life.

275
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:06,031
YOUNGER FRANKIE (VOICEOVER): I
don't want to be set for life.

276
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:06,865
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER):
That's the most

277
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:07,999
Ridiculous thing I ever heard.

278
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:08,700
YOUNGER FRANKIE
(VOICEOVER): Why?

279
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:09,368
I don't want to do it.

280
00:36:09,468 --> 00:36:10,636
I don't enjoy it.

281
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:13,772
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER): Whoever
said life was enjoyable?

282
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:15,173
YOUNGER FRANKIE
(VOICEOVER): I don't care.

283
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:16,174
I'm gonna marry her.

284
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:16,975
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER):
You better care.

285
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:18,210
She's only after the money.

286
00:36:18,310 --> 00:36:19,311
YOUNGER FRANKIE (VOICEOVER):
I don't have any money.

287
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,412
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER):
She wants my money!

288
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:20,979
YOUNGER FRANKIE (VOICEOVER):
That's bullshit.

289
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,348
She loves me.

290
00:36:22,448 --> 00:36:23,815
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER): You're
a fool, and she's using you.

291
00:36:26,452 --> 00:36:27,686
Don't you ever talk
to me like that!

292
00:36:27,786 --> 00:36:29,087
YOUNGER FRANKIE
(VOICEOVER): Oh, fuck you.

293
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:29,921
You're not my father.

294
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:31,323
You never were a father to me.

295
00:36:31,423 --> 00:36:32,691
You're a piece of shit.

296
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:34,293
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER): Don't
you ever talk to me like that!

297
00:36:34,393 --> 00:36:37,296
YOUNGER FRANKIE
(VOICEOVER): I'll kill you!

298
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:38,664
FRANKIE (VOICEOVER):
I can no longer

299
00:36:38,764 --> 00:36:44,002
Tell where one torture
ends and the next begins.

300
00:36:44,102 --> 00:36:46,137
OLDER MAN (VOICEOVER): I'll
cut you off from everything!

301
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:46,938
You'll starve!

302
00:37:27,279 --> 00:37:57,343
The

303
00:37:57,443 --> 00:37:59,511
What do you got for me, Mike?

304
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:00,312
Something.

305
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:01,447
I got something good.

306
00:38:01,547 --> 00:38:02,448
That's nice.

307
00:38:02,548 --> 00:38:03,549
It makes business
so much smoother.

308
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:10,589
Here it is.

309
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:11,723
Wait a minute.

310
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:12,991
Let me see what you're
trying to pawn on me.

311
00:38:13,091 --> 00:38:14,326
It's worth at least 100.

312
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:15,226
100?

313
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:16,161
Why not 1,000?

314
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:16,962
No, wait.

315
00:38:17,062 --> 00:38:19,898
Let's make it 5,000.

316
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,132
What about a million?

317
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:22,601
It's worth at least that much.

318
00:38:22,701 --> 00:38:23,869
Right, asshole?
Yeah, that's it.

319
00:38:23,969 --> 00:38:24,670
It's worth a million.

320
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:25,471
It's a million.

321
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:26,738
Shut up.

322
00:38:26,838 --> 00:38:28,374
What do you guys
provoke him for?

323
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,609
It only makes him worse.

324
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:32,444
This is costume jewelry, Mike.

325
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:33,479
It's paste.

326
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:34,413

01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:29,525
That hit me like a bullet.

826
01:15:29,626 --> 01:15:30,660
Bullets.

827
01:15:30,760 --> 01:15:32,596
This shit was armed.

828
01:15:32,696 --> 01:15:34,263
FRANKIE (VOICEOVER): I
felt a tremendous power

829
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,199
Surging through my veins.

830
01:15:36,299 --> 01:15:37,200
Where's the gun?

831
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:48,578
FRANKIE (VOICEOVER):
I have now become God.

833
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,849
Holy shit.

834
01:15:52,949 --> 01:15:54,250
It's not loaded, man.

835
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:55,184
It can't be.

836
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:56,119
We got the bullets.

837
01:15:56,219 --> 01:15:58,287
Drop it or you're dead.

[Gunfire]

839
01:16:14,137 --> 01:16:15,038
Frankie, look.

840
01:16:15,138 --> 01:16:16,239
We'll make a deal, see?

841
01:16:16,339 --> 01:16:18,474
I won't tell the cops
about the other guys, OK?

842
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:20,610
And you don't owe me any
money either, all right?

843
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:21,410
Here.

844
01:16:21,510 --> 01:16:22,411
Here, take what I got, huh?

845
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:23,379
Come on.
Put it down.

846
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:24,380
Don't kill me.

01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:25,381

[Gunfire]

853
01:18:10,019 --> 01:18:11,520
FRANKIE (VOICEOVER): We
marched into the village

854
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,690
After three days of
intense fighting.

855
01:18:14,791 --> 01:18:17,493
Our casualty rate was enormous.

856
01:18:17,593 --> 01:18:20,196
We were expecting an
ambush, but everyone was

857
01:18:20,296 --> 01:18:23,399
Dead in front of their huts.

858
01:18:23,499 --> 01:18:29,272
They had killed themselves,
the women and children too.

859
01:18:29,372 --> 01:18:31,908
Then we were ordered
to pump rounds of ammo

860
01:18:32,008 --> 01:18:35,678
Into the dead bodies
to scare the VC.

861
01:18:35,779 --> 01:18:38,114
And so we did.

862
01:18:38,214 --> 01:18:42,585
M-16s, pistols, everything.

863
01:18:42,685 --> 01:18:46,089
The whole fucking
squad just went crazy.

864
01:18:46,189 --> 01:18:50,960
Bodies were butchered till
they looked like piles of meat.

865
01:18:51,060 --> 01:18:53,362
My friends became animals.

866
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:56,365
They began to enjoy it.

867
01:18:56,465 --> 01:19:00,203
I knew I had to get out,
or I'd become one of them.

868
01:19:00,303 --> 01:19:02,705
So I started running.

869
01:19:02,806 --> 01:19:06,810
They called me a deserter,
but what was I deserting?

870
01:19:06,910 --> 01:19:11,280
I had never understood
what it was, what it meant.

871
01:19:11,380 --> 01:19:13,716
But now it was so clear.

872
01:19:13,817 --> 01:19:16,119
You see, they
wanted no part of us

873
01:19:16,219 --> 01:19:19,755
And took their own
way out together.

874
01:19:19,856 --> 01:19:22,992
Their wives wouldn't be
raped, nor the children

875
01:19:23,092 --> 01:19:24,794
Tortured and mutilated.

876
01:19:24,894 --> 01:19:27,964
They cheated us,
oh, yes, they did.

877
01:19:28,064 --> 01:19:30,133
They were the survivors.

878
01:19:30,233 --> 01:19:33,402
It was getting
clearer all the time.

879
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,238
The war is not over.

880
01:19:35,338 --> 01:19:37,173
The battlefield
may have changed,

881
01:19:37,273 --> 01:19:39,775
But the war is not over.

882
01:19:39,876 --> 01:19:42,145
And you were right, Dad.

883
01:19:42,245 --> 01:19:44,547
Your son died in Saigon.

884
01:19:44,647 --> 01:19:46,850

to save my family.

So now we're being thrown out.

God, what were you, in a fight?

894
01:20:26,522 --> 01:20:29,625
Did you get a job?

895
01:20:29,725 --> 01:20:33,196
Did you call your father?

896
01:20:33,296 --> 01:20:34,964
What did you do today?

897
01:20:35,064 --> 01:20:36,599
And what's the matter with you?

really cracking up.
