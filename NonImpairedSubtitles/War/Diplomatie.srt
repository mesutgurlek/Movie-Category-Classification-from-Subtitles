1
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,832
<i>From all German stations,</i>

2
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:50,665
<i>including those of</i>
<i>the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia,</i>

3
00:00:50,833 --> 00:00:52,499
<i>the General Government,</i>

4
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:54,915
<i>the Brussels Two</i>
<i>and Luxemburg stations,</i>

5
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:56,749
<i>and the Paris station.</i>

6
00:00:57,416 --> 00:01:01,415
<i>In the Night Concerts series,</i>
<i>the Deutsche Rundfunk presents</i>

7
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,874
<i>the Seventh Symphony</i>
<i>by Ludwig van Beethoven,</i>

8
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:08,249
<i>conducted by Wilhelm Furtwängler.</i>

9
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:15,249
Warsaw, early August 1944

10
00:01:40,458 --> 00:01:44,707
DIPLOMACY

11
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:47,957
<i>Europe was consumed by war.</i>

12
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:50,540
<i>We were all going to die.</i>

13
00:01:51,541 --> 00:01:54,540
<i>After the Landings,</i>
<i>the Allies marched on Paris.</i>

14
00:01:55,416 --> 00:01:58,749
<i>The Germans planned to destroy,</i>
<i>to raze everything.</i>

15
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,415
<i>Especially Paris.</i>

16
00:02:02,666 --> 00:02:05,040
<i>Nothing was to be left standing.</i>

17
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,040
<i>The Führer's orders.</i>

18
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:12,582
Paris,
the night of August 24-25, 1944

19
00:03:32,166 --> 00:03:33,790
Here's your coffee.

20
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:36,207
You haven't slept all night again.

21
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,249
Morning, Maryse.

22
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:40,290
Tell Mayer to bring me
my uniform and boots, please.

23
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,457
But it's 4 a.m.

24
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:44,499
Do as I ask.

25
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:50,999
Morning, sir.

26
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:52,707
Morning, Mayer.

27
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,707
General,
you're standing against the light.

28
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,540
Not even a child would miss you.

29
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:04,582
Children are asleep at this time.

30
00:04:05,041 --> 00:04:06,040
Come inside.

31
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:07,207
Please.

32
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,749
What's that, Mayer?

33
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,249
Looks like a man
taking his dog for a walk.

34
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,040
Such arrogance!

35
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,499
The Parisians think we're finished.

36
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:49,999
Mayer, pills!

37
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,124
Quickly!

38
00:04:58,333 --> 00:05:00,290
- Should I call Dr. Fischer?
- No.

39
00:05:01,041 --> 00:05:03,749
Take long, deep breaths, sir.

40
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:15,415
Are you ready?

41
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:16,957
Yes, sir.

42
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,374
Alfred has the car ready.

43
00:05:19,833 --> 00:05:20,999
But, General...

44
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:23,249
It's not a favor I'm asking you,

45
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,915
it's an order.

46
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,957
Take that letter to my wife.

47
00:05:29,666 --> 00:05:32,582
Tell her
I was only doing my duty.

48
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,707
Chocolates. For the children.

49
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:44,540
General, your telegrams.

50
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:45,582
Okay, fine.

51
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:57,374
The enemy broke through
our defenses last night.

52
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:58,374
Reinforcements?

53
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,207
That's fine, thank you very much.

54
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:10,874
Mr. Lanvin?

55
00:06:12,166 --> 00:06:13,332
This way, please.

56
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:14,832
Why that way?

57
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,290
The General's orders.

58
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:22,624
They're near Soissons, 3 hours away.
The roads are minefields.

59
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:25,540
They'll be here at noon,
if there's no more sabotage.

60
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:27,582
The enemy's only 2 hours away.

61
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:28,790
Gentlemen...

62
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,749
If Paris falls, all of France falls.

63
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,582
And the Americans march on Germany.

64
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,707
There's no other choice left to me.

65
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:41,499
The explosion will be heard in Berlin.

66
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,707
And 50 years from now, too, I bet.

67
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:48,957
Well, sir?

68
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:51,290
What are you going to do?

69
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,332
My duty.

70
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:56,915
You can rely on me.

71
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,457
I know.

72
00:06:58,916 --> 00:07:00,249
I have faith in you.

73
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:02,124
Thank you, Mayer.

74
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:04,082
But as the French say,

75
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,582
you only die once,
but you stay dead a long time.

76
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,707
Don't delay, get out of the city.

77
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:10,832
Rest assured.

78
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,915
I'll be in Baden-Baden tonight.

79
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,790
Drop by Café Karl.
Eat a pretzel for me.

80
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,082
Alfred!

81
00:07:25,041 --> 00:07:26,207
For the General's wife.

82
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:27,624
Have a good trip.

83
00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,082
What is it?

84
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:36,082
- You must leave.
- I know. Just a moment.

85
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:38,332
It's pointless. The fun is over.

86
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,290
I can't go out
without my eyes.

87
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,415
Mr. Lanvin.

88
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,624
Good morning.

89
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:10,707
Major Ebernach
and the French engineer are here.

90
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,874
Have them wait a moment.

91
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,374
The General's orders are to dig in
in Paris.

92
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,415
We'll give the enemy hell.

93
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,957
We'll fight street by street
to the last bullet.

94
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:26,499
That way, we'll hold them up a while.

95
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:29,165
They won't be in Germany anytime soon.

96
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,915
- I'll take that.
- Fine.

97
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,582
What took 40 minutes in Kowel
will take longer in Paris,

98
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:44,124
but afterwards
there won't be a stone left standing.

99
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,874
Sorry for making you use
the backstairs.

100
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,082
I'd rather not alarm the staff
or our troops.

101
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,290
Suits me.
I won't boast about this.

102
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,957
Your expertise
will be very useful to us.

103
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,374
You know, I regret...

104
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,124
Spare me your qualms.
I have my own.

105
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,749
Of course,
he didn't help us voluntarily.

106
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,915
But, as he's the expert,
I suggest he explains personally.

107
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:08,582
Lanvin, you have
the General's attention.

108
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,832
All right, then.

109
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,832
The bridges...

110
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:16,040
33 of them, in all.

111
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,707
And a dozen more on the outskirts.

112
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:23,040
All rigged with explosives.

113
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,082
Except the Pont Neuf, right here.

114
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:28,957
It's the oldest.

115
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:32,540
It will allow you
to cross between both banks

116
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:35,082
and to use the island
as a stronghold.

117
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:40,707
Blowing up the bridges
will cause the Seine to burst its banks,

118
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,790
like in the flood of 1910.

119
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,540
Rubble will dam the river.

120
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,624
All of south-eastern Paris
will soon be under water.

121
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:52,707
Le Marais, first.

122
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:56,624
Then, the flooding
will spread to Nation and Bastille.

123
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,124
Probably 3-4 meters deep in places.

124
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:04,290
That means no electricity,
no sewerage, nothing.

125
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,707
Buildings and streets will collapse.

126
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,499
We don't need explosives in this area.

127
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,915
The Seine will do the job for us.

128
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,957
Go on, Mr. Lanvin.

129
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,374
Five minutes after the bridges,

130
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:20,957
Notre-Dame cathedral...

131
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:24,582
the Louvre...

132
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,374
and the Opera

133
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,165
will in turn explode.

134
00:10:30,583 --> 00:10:33,749
Taking the city center with them.
Nothing will be left.

135
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:37,124
And the stations?

136
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,665
Of course, the stations...

137
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:44,957
Debris from Orsay Station
will help block the Seine.

138
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,665
Likewise, the destruction

139
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:52,165
of the other stations,
Austerlitz, Lyon,

140
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:56,665
Gare du Nord, Gare de l'Est
and St. Lazare,

141
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,957
will paralyze the right bank.

142
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,457
If I'd been told
as an Architecture student

143
00:11:03,625 --> 00:11:06,124
that one day I'd blow up Paris...

144
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,790
Humanity is resilient, Ebernach.

145
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,790
Outside Sevastopol,
to prepare your attack,

146
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:17,082
I had no hesitation
in blowing up the old fort.

147
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:21,915
Ebernach, in Sevastopol,

148
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,874
I had to carry out
the hardest order of my career,

149
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:27,415
the liquidation
of the Jewish population.

150
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:31,624
I obeyed that order
and accepted all the consequences.

151
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,582
I know.
We dug the mass graves.

152
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,290
And we filled them in.

153
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,915
Today, it's Paris!

154
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:48,207
Three tons of cheddite
around Place de la Concorde.

155
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,207
Four tons in parliament

156
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,915
and the basement of Les Invalides.

157
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:11,374
And 4 submarine torpedoes
on each leg of the Eiffel Tower.

158
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:19,790
The Arc de Triomphe
will blow with Place de La Concorde

159
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,957
to clear a line of fire
along the Champs-Elysées.

160
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:26,665
That will take 20 minutes.

161
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,332
And then, believe me,

162
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,040
Paris will be unrecognizable.

163
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,749
Good work.

164
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,624
The Parisians will remember you.

165
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,540
If there are any left.

166
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:40,332
What's your estimation of casualties?

167
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,499
It's hard to escape from hell.

168
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,165
The current population's
around 1.5 million.

169
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:48,707
That's not too bad.
Tell your men to be ready.

170
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:50,165
They are.

171
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:55,082
One of my platoons
is checking the time-switches.

172
00:12:55,250 --> 00:12:58,957
It'll take 15-20 minutes.
Then the platoon leader will call you.

173
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:00,665
His name?

174
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,790
1st Lieutenant Hegger.

175
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:05,082
Where is he?

176
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,832
I'd rather tell you that in private.

177
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:10,124
Bressensdorf...

178
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,790
Keep an eye on Mr. Lanvin.
Don't let him go anywhere.

179
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,374
Yes, sir.

180
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:24,915
Where is he?

181
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,915
At the parliament building,
the Assemblée nationale.

182
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,124
General, my task is complete.

183
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:36,915
I request permission
to leave Paris with my unit.

184
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,374
What?

185
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:41,749
You want to go?

186
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:43,874
With your permission.

187
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,707
1st Lieutenant Hegger
will lead the operation.

188
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,540
I've known him since Ukraine.

189
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,790
I fully vouch for him.

190
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:05,749
We are needed elsewhere.

191
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,624
Immediately after France fell,
the Führer visited Paris,

192
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:36,082
to show his architect, Speer,
the city he admired most,

193
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,874
especially the Opera,
his favorite monument.

194
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,124
They went around it twice.

195
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,624
So why destroy it?

196
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:48,832
Hitler wanted Berlin
to be as beautiful as Paris,

197
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:49,999
and bigger.

198
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:53,624
Now, four years later,
Berlin is in ruins,

199
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,624
while Paris
is as glorious as ever. See?

200
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,624
It's unbearable for him.

201
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:03,707
Even if it serves no strategic purpose,

202
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:07,624
Paris must be flattened,
especially the Opera.

203
00:15:21,833 --> 00:15:22,874
Choltitz.

204
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:24,165
Berlin?

205
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:25,582
I'll hold.

206
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,040
I was cut off.
Put me through to Berlin, will you?

207
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,915
Morning, General.

208
00:15:55,666 --> 00:15:57,207
Consul?

209
00:15:58,083 --> 00:16:00,124
I'm not interrupting, I hope.

210
00:16:01,583 --> 00:16:03,499
I didn't hear you come in.

211
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,957
To be honest, I didn't knock.

212
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:08,707
May I?

213
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,207
The stairs are pretty steep.

214
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,415
I thought you'd left Paris.
How did you get in here?

215
00:16:19,583 --> 00:16:20,624
Your hotel

216
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:24,290
is admirably located
in the heart of the capital but...

217
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,832
You have no idea of its history.
Of this suite, in particular.

218
00:16:29,125 --> 00:16:30,915
What are you trying to say?

219
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,832
I didn't come through the lobby.

220
00:16:34,875 --> 00:16:36,374
Nor through that door.

221
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:40,165
I know, very rude,
and not a habit of mine.

222
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,332
I needed to see you unseen.

223
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,665
Explain, Mr. Nordling!
I hate riddles.

224
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,999
In Paris, every hotel has its secrets.

225
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,249
The Crillon, Ritz, and the Meurice.

226
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,999
When you moved in,
you had 200 rooms to choose from.

227
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:55,957
You took the only one
with a false bottom.

228
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:58,999
A false bottom?

229
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:03,290
Have you ever heard of Elisabeth Aryet?

230
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,999
- Who?
- Elisabeth Aryet.

231
00:17:06,375 --> 00:17:07,999
And Miss Howard?

232
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,457
Never mind.
They are one and the same person.

233
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:16,457
Miss Howard was her stage name.
It's an old story but still very juicy.

234
00:17:16,833 --> 00:17:19,999
Around 1860, she took
numerous minor parts in plays,

235
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,207
and some evenings,
lovers to her bed.

236
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:26,874
One of her lovers
lived not very far from here,

237
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:29,707
over the road in the Tuileries Palace.

238
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,707
He was Napoleon III.

239
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,665
In France, power
and affairs of the heart don't mix,

240
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,499
especially involving an actress.

241
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,999
But he was fond of her,
so he moved her in here.

242
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:44,374
And to ensure greater discretion,

243
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,165
he issued orders

244
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,332
to build this staircase.

245
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,790
A bit steep, I grant you.

246
00:17:56,000 --> 00:18:00,374
It leads not to the entrance
guarded by your men on Rue de Rivoli,

247
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,040
but Rue du Mont-Thabor.

248
00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,832
The Emperor
merely had to cross the Tuileries,

249
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,665
walk up the stairs

250
00:18:10,041 --> 00:18:11,790
and into the arms of...

251
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,749
Miss Howard.

252
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,749
France was none the worse for it.

253
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,290
Hans!

254
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,999
You two,
go down to Rue du Mont-Thabor.

255
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,415
- What number?
- There is no number.

256
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:43,207
Where is it?

257
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,749
Is this necessary?
I doubt Napoleon III will drop in.

258
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,457
Where is it?

259
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:54,165
The steel door
on the corner of Rue de Castiglione.

260
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,832
The corner of Rue de Castiglione.

261
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,415
You, follow me.

262
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,457
Check this staircase is secure.

263
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:12,624
There are 2-3,000 terrorists out there,

264
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:15,374
who'd happily spit on my corpse.

265
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:20,124
Did I not release
all political prisoners?

266
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,540
The last were freed yesterday.

267
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,332
So, what now?

268
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,540
I came to suggest
you put an end to all this.

269
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,999
Your so-called terrorists are patriots.

270
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,957
I respect enemy combatants,

271
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,332
but they are Bolshevik criminals,

272
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:41,249
and I will crush
every last one of them!

273
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:44,165
Kill one
and you create two more.

274
00:19:44,333 --> 00:19:46,915
That depends
on the resources we deploy.

275
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:50,832
I was sent to Paris to restore order.
I shall do much more.

276
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,790
What will you do exactly?

277
00:19:56,791 --> 00:20:00,082
Nothing special.
The stairs lead down to the street.

278
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,832
I was cut off.
It's urgent, take care of it.

279
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,790
- What's going on?
- No time.

280
00:20:14,708 --> 00:20:17,624
Choltitz isn't finished yet.
If you saw him at Kharkov...

281
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,040
I was there.

282
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:19,999
You too?

283
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,624
To think that barely two weeks ago,

284
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:27,665
Paris was the dream posting
for a German soldier.

285
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:34,874
The most docile, disciplined territory
in the whole of Nazi Europe.

286
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:40,832
An officer posted here
knew he had left the war behind

287
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,665
and would want for nothing.

288
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,790
The only battles to be fought here

289
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:50,707
were to obtain the best table
in a restaurant.

290
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:58,082
The Parisians are cowards,
Mr. Nordling.

291
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,540
They skulked
in their homes for four years.

292
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,957
The enemy's Normandy landings
brought some out,

293
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:11,082
and now they start to attack us,
to defy us,

294
00:21:11,416 --> 00:21:13,582
killing dozens of my men.

295
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,124
I shall make them pay.

296
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:21,165
With no distinction
between terrorists and the others.

297
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:28,707
I advise you to leave the city
forthwith. It's not your war.

298
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,749
Leave Paris no less?
And go where?

299
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:36,290
I have no idea.
Back home, I suppose.

300
00:21:36,916 --> 00:21:38,374
Back home?

301
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,499
This is my home.

302
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,874
You can't say the same.

303
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:45,207
Pardon me?

304
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,165
We're foreigners.
I'm Swedish, you're German,

305
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:51,040
but I was born
and lived all my life in Paris.

306
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:54,082
You've been here barely two weeks.

307
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:55,499
So what?

308
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,749
I know these men and women.
They won't leave you in peace.

309
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:04,374
They've sacrificed theirjobs,
comfort and families.

310
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,332
They'll die for their cause.

311
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:10,374
Same here, Mr. Nordling.
This is war, not a pleasure cruise.

312
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,457
Indeed. But you have 2,000 men.

313
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,832
And on the other side? 3 million.

314
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,165
One day very soon,
they'll make short work of you.

315
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,040
Who? The French?

316
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,749
Short work of us?

317
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:24,499
You claim to know them?

318
00:22:24,916 --> 00:22:27,207
You're a diplomat, I'm a soldier.

319
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,082
Spare me your advice.

320
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:33,874
3 million civilians, what's that?
Nothing!

321
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,082
It's bluster!

322
00:22:36,375 --> 00:22:38,707
I'll swat them aside like flies.

323
00:22:43,625 --> 00:22:48,499
Governor, two armored divisions
strike for Paris, as we speak.

324
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:53,082
Two Allied divisions. We both know it.
You must face facts.

325
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,957
Two divisions, that's 30-40,000 soldiers
you cannot hope to beat,

326
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:01,207
who will enter the city shortly
to fight alongside its population.

327
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:02,790
What will you do then?

328
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:07,124
You think the enemy
is alone on the road to Paris?

329
00:23:08,291 --> 00:23:10,540
Fear not, reinforcements are coming.

330
00:23:10,708 --> 00:23:13,124
Four SS Panzer divisions

331
00:23:13,291 --> 00:23:15,582
left Denmark six days ago.

332
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:20,207
You mean the 4 divisions
stuck since yesterday near Soissons?

333
00:23:23,375 --> 00:23:25,582
Surely not.
You're expecting others.

334
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:28,415
My time is precious.
Come to the point.

335
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:31,665
As you wish.

336
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:36,332
My embassy was contacted last night
by the French general

337
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,624
whose divisions are headed your way.

338
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:43,582
He told me, or rather asked me,

339
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,999
to give you this letter.

340
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,874
A letter? From a French general?

341
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,040
Interesting.

342
00:23:55,833 --> 00:23:57,707
You know this general, then.

343
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:00,540
I've heard of him. Everybody has.

344
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:03,290
- You've never met him?
- Not yet.

345
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:05,540
So, why your embassy?

346
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,082
I suppose he was told

347
00:24:07,250 --> 00:24:09,874
that we'd met frequently
in the last few days,

348
00:24:10,041 --> 00:24:13,540
that I'd been the go-between
for the political prisoners,

349
00:24:13,958 --> 00:24:16,749
and that we are on good terms,
you and I.

350
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,040
On good terms?

351
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:23,874
We are, aren't we?

352
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,165
Perhaps he simply thought

353
00:24:26,333 --> 00:24:29,915
that representing a neutral nation
would make my task easier.

354
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:33,540
That's why you're here?
To deliver that letter?

355
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:40,207
Who are you working for, Mr. Nordling?

356
00:24:42,541 --> 00:24:44,040
I beg your pardon?

357
00:24:45,958 --> 00:24:48,124
Who are you working for?

358
00:24:50,541 --> 00:24:53,832
A general you hardly know
wakes you one night,

359
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,290
and you come running?

360
00:24:55,458 --> 00:24:58,332
If I can help create a climate...

361
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:00,040
Naturally.

362
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:02,874
Well, give me the letter.

363
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:10,415
I am not in the habit

364
00:25:10,583 --> 00:25:14,207
of corresponding with an enemy general

365
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:17,249
before hostilities have ended.

366
00:25:18,125 --> 00:25:19,749
You can take that back.

367
00:25:21,583 --> 00:25:23,582
That's exactly what I told him.

368
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:28,124
If I were you, I'd have read it first,
if only out of curiosity.

369
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:29,124
Pointless.

370
00:25:29,291 --> 00:25:33,207
Tell this jester
I do not accept ultimatums.

371
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:36,249
It is exactly that. You're very sharp.

372
00:25:36,958 --> 00:25:40,040
No, it's simply usual practice
in the circumstances.

373
00:25:40,208 --> 00:25:42,457
It's usual practice? I'd no idea.

374
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:46,415
And your duty is to reject it?
That's usual practice?

375
00:25:46,583 --> 00:25:49,124
No, I have my orders,
and I never question an order.

376
00:25:49,291 --> 00:25:50,332
Of course.

377
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,707
Otherwise, you wouldn't be a general.

378
00:25:55,583 --> 00:25:57,957
What if an order is absurd?

379
00:25:58,125 --> 00:26:00,540
I have never received such an order.

380
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,540
Never?

381
00:26:06,625 --> 00:26:07,707
Never.

382
00:26:10,458 --> 00:26:12,915
You can't defend Paris with 2,000 men.

383
00:26:13,083 --> 00:26:14,915
It's impossible, as you know.

384
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:19,415
General Leclerc guarantees
honorable surrender for you and Germany,

385
00:26:19,583 --> 00:26:21,040
with only two conditions.

386
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:23,124
One, you surrender without a fight.

387
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,290
Two, you return Paris as you found it.

388
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:27,790
In other words, intact. That's all.

389
00:26:29,625 --> 00:26:31,082
Think about it, General.

390
00:26:33,166 --> 00:26:35,040
Have you finished, Consul?

391
00:26:36,083 --> 00:26:37,374
I beg your pardon?

392
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:40,707
Hans!

393
00:26:42,708 --> 00:26:43,957
Get me Bressensdorf.

394
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,165
I'd ask you to leave now.

395
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:50,290
Don't argue. Leave!

396
00:27:03,291 --> 00:27:04,999
What do I tell General Leclerc?

397
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:07,749
Tell him he'll remember today.

398
00:27:08,708 --> 00:27:12,249
Ensure Mr. Nordling
reaches his embassy safely.

399
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:14,082
Yes, sir.

400
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:16,832
Choltitz.

401
00:27:18,125 --> 00:27:19,582
What is it, Lieutenant?

402
00:27:21,416 --> 00:27:22,374
What?

403
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,207
Hold on.

404
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:29,707
I asked you to leave, Mr. Nordling.

405
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:30,915
Follow me.

406
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:34,082
That's Lt. Hegger, I suppose.

407
00:27:34,875 --> 00:27:35,832
Pardon me?

408
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:38,957
I fear he doesn't have
good news for you.

409
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,749
Here, I'll leave you this, just in case.

410
00:27:43,833 --> 00:27:47,582
It's a copy of the letter you ripped up.

411
00:27:53,166 --> 00:27:54,874
Wait, Bressensdorf.

412
00:27:57,875 --> 00:27:59,290
Yes, Lieutenant, go ahead.

413
00:27:59,541 --> 00:28:02,207
The detonator mechanisms
have been sabotaged.

414
00:28:02,833 --> 00:28:03,457
Sorry?

415
00:28:03,625 --> 00:28:04,582
<i>How much damage?</i>

416
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,165
I can't say yet.

417
00:28:07,125 --> 00:28:08,832
Out, Bressensdorf!

418
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:11,499
Consul Nordling stays with me.

419
00:28:12,708 --> 00:28:14,040
Very good, sir.

420
00:28:16,625 --> 00:28:18,165
How much time do you need?

421
00:28:20,708 --> 00:28:24,249
Do what it takes.
You have ten minutes.

422
00:28:24,416 --> 00:28:25,832
<i>Not a second longer.</i>

423
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:27,999
What about the Resistance men?

424
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,999
Yes, sir.

425
00:28:33,125 --> 00:28:34,874
I'll keep you informed.

426
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:40,082
Load.

427
00:28:41,375 --> 00:28:42,749
Take aim.

428
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:43,582
Fire!

429
00:28:54,541 --> 00:28:58,999
It appears I was letting you go
too soon, Consul.

430
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:05,582
There was more. How did you know?

431
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:07,082
Pardon me?

432
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:09,124
That Lt. Hegger would call.

433
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,499
I'm a diplomat.
I love listening at doors.

434
00:29:16,083 --> 00:29:18,540
By the way, Café Karl ran out of...

435
00:29:19,708 --> 00:29:22,499
pretzels long ago, you know.

436
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:24,290
Rationing.

437
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:27,207
Corporal Mayer won't be happy.

438
00:29:27,375 --> 00:29:29,082
How long were you at that door?

439
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:32,957
Impressive, these chess pieces.
They add a dimension to your map.

440
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:35,832
Look at me when I talk to you.

441
00:29:36,833 --> 00:29:39,665
What do you know?
Who tipped off the terrorists?

442
00:29:41,041 --> 00:29:42,207
What terrorists?

443
00:29:42,625 --> 00:29:46,332
Don't play dumb now.
Lt. Hegger's work was sabotaged.

444
00:29:46,791 --> 00:29:49,624
How unfortunate. I haven't a clue.

445
00:29:49,958 --> 00:29:52,207
How did you know he'd be delayed?

446
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:57,332
His unit's location was known
only to myself and Ebernach.

447
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,124
I had no idea.

448
00:30:00,291 --> 00:30:02,665
I'd advise you to stop this.

449
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,499
In your own best interest, answer me.

450
00:30:05,708 --> 00:30:07,499
I thought I was answering you.

451
00:30:08,375 --> 00:30:10,874
How long have you spied on me
for France?

452
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,165
I don't work for France.

453
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,707
Who then? Britain? America?

454
00:30:16,875 --> 00:30:19,165
You accord me too much importance.

455
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:21,665
My initiative is strictly personal.

456
00:30:21,833 --> 00:30:23,082
You think I'm stupid?

457
00:30:25,583 --> 00:30:28,082
If I may, I'd rather not answer that.

458
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:31,124
Turn around. I haven't finished.

459
00:30:31,291 --> 00:30:34,207
Just a moment,
while I bring this up to date.

460
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,832
Stand clear of that map!

461
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:42,290
I'll tell you what happened.

462
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,832
You did come up those stairs,
but not alone.

463
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,124
You had an accomplice,

464
00:30:50,166 --> 00:30:51,707
one of the terrorists.

465
00:30:53,083 --> 00:30:55,707
You both hid behind the door,

466
00:30:55,875 --> 00:30:59,165
until you had
the information you came for.

467
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:03,207
Then, the other man

468
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,499
went to inform your friends.

469
00:31:12,666 --> 00:31:17,124
And you entered
in order to buy some time.

470
00:31:18,291 --> 00:31:20,624
You knew
I wouldn't be easily dissuaded,

471
00:31:20,791 --> 00:31:24,040
that a minor French general's letter

472
00:31:24,208 --> 00:31:25,957
wouldn't change my mind.

473
00:31:27,083 --> 00:31:29,332
Unless my operation was sabotaged,

474
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,624
leaving me no alternative
but to negotiate.

475
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:36,749
Well? Is that it?

476
00:31:37,666 --> 00:31:38,915
Admit it.

477
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:45,707
Do you know
what we do to men like you?

478
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,374
Give them a medal?

479
00:31:50,875 --> 00:31:53,082
Yes, on occasion.

480
00:31:54,291 --> 00:31:56,082
Posthumously.

481
00:31:59,583 --> 00:32:02,707
You forget one thing, Governor.

482
00:32:02,916 --> 00:32:04,624
One small detail.

483
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:07,457
Supposing I were
in collusion with the Resistance,

484
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,790
and with my knowledge
of the staircase's existence,

485
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:14,040
do you think
you would still be alive?

486
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:20,499
In two weeks,
if I'd wanted to bring in armed men,

487
00:32:20,666 --> 00:32:23,082
I'd have had no lack of opportunity.

488
00:32:23,416 --> 00:32:25,124
Especially, tonight.

489
00:32:34,791 --> 00:32:37,957
Sweden is a neutral country, Governor.

490
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:41,915
It has maintained its neutrality

491
00:32:42,083 --> 00:32:43,957
throughout two world wars.

492
00:32:45,291 --> 00:32:48,582
I have no wish
to change that state of affairs.

493
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:02,749
In that case,
what are you doing here?

494
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:08,624
I came here for that.

495
00:33:09,583 --> 00:33:11,957
So your children
see that, too, one day.

496
00:33:12,166 --> 00:33:13,832
Dawn over Paris.

497
00:33:14,541 --> 00:33:16,624
- Stand back from the balcony.
- Sorry?

498
00:33:16,791 --> 00:33:18,332
You could signal to your men.

499
00:33:18,750 --> 00:33:20,415
- Please!
- Stand back.

500
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:22,290
How can I prove to you...

501
00:33:22,458 --> 00:33:24,124
Don't argue. Stand back!

502
00:33:36,833 --> 00:33:38,582
How old are your children?

503
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:40,874
Leave my children out of this.

504
00:33:41,583 --> 00:33:44,832
You can answer
without fear of betraying a secret.

505
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:49,582
My girls are 14 and 8,
and my boy's 4 months old.

506
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:51,290
Four months?

507
00:33:51,625 --> 00:33:53,082
Congratulations!

508
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,874
When I was 8,
like your younger daughter,

509
00:33:56,041 --> 00:33:59,040
I often wondered
how a name as simple as Paris

510
00:33:59,208 --> 00:34:03,249
could represent all the things
visible from your balcony.

511
00:34:04,625 --> 00:34:07,582
All these streets, houses, plazas...

512
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,790
All the squares, too.

513
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:15,874
I couldn't see how so many things
and so many people

514
00:34:16,041 --> 00:34:20,374
could fit in a city
whose name was so short.

515
00:34:25,875 --> 00:34:28,832
Why do you insist
on destroying the city?

516
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,457
It's none of your business.

517
00:34:32,625 --> 00:34:35,415
Wrong.
If I hadn't been asked to contact you,

518
00:34:35,583 --> 00:34:39,832
I'd be asleep, oblivious,
like all these people you'll soon kill.

519
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,790
Can you stop your histrionics?

520
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:45,707
They are civilians,
caught up in an absurd war,

521
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,540
innocent of any action against you.

522
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:54,999
What does a life mean to you?
What is a life?

523
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:59,457
Of those about to perish,
how many children like yours?

524
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:00,665
Be quiet!

525
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:11,915
You sneak in like a thief
and lecture me in morality?

526
00:35:14,583 --> 00:35:18,082
Allow me to remind you of something.

527
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:22,540
One year ago, from July-August '43,
to be precise,

528
00:35:23,041 --> 00:35:28,207
your friends dropped
over 10,000 tons of bombs on Hamburg.

529
00:35:28,375 --> 00:35:29,540
10,000 tons!

530
00:35:31,125 --> 00:35:34,624
Most were phosphorus bombs.
You know what that means?

531
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:36,915
Anybody who wasn't shredded
or incinerated

532
00:35:37,083 --> 00:35:40,499
died of suffocation
with their throat and lungs on fire.

533
00:35:40,666 --> 00:35:44,082
They were civilians.
Women, children, old folks.

534
00:35:44,291 --> 00:35:47,290
None of them had fought in battle.

535
00:35:48,666 --> 00:35:50,915
How curious that you never protest

536
00:35:51,083 --> 00:35:54,040
when the civilians being killed
are ours?

537
00:35:55,541 --> 00:35:57,332
You are misinformed, General.

538
00:35:57,500 --> 00:36:01,374
My embassy and I have always
denounced such actions from all sides.

539
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:07,624
Not with the ardor you display today.
Definitely not!

540
00:36:09,666 --> 00:36:12,040
By that logic,
the Allies destroying a city

541
00:36:12,208 --> 00:36:15,332
gives you the right to destroy one, too.
Correct?

542
00:36:16,916 --> 00:36:20,749
Unless, of course,
you are merely looking for excuses.

543
00:36:21,708 --> 00:36:23,374
Excuses?

544
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:26,957
I won't believe
you have no misgivings?

545
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:29,540
Believe what you want, Mr. Nordling.

546
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,165
My conscience is clear.

547
00:36:33,458 --> 00:36:37,499
Paris will suffer the same fate
as Mannheim, Hamburg and Berlin.

548
00:36:37,916 --> 00:36:40,082
We'll all have our martyrs.

549
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:41,332
Now you know.

550
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:43,332
It makes you a criminal.

551
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:45,499
- A criminal?
- Absolutely.

552
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:47,624
The pilots who bombed Hamburg,

553
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:49,707
we'll never know their names.

554
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:51,624
But you give the orders.

555
00:36:51,791 --> 00:36:54,457
You'll be remembered
as the man who destroyed Paris.

556
00:36:54,625 --> 00:36:57,415
How does that make me a criminal?

557
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:02,165
The annihilation of a city
outside a combat zone is a criminal act.

558
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:04,332
Yes, we agree there.

559
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:08,290
Paris, as far as I know,
is not in any combat zone.

560
00:37:08,458 --> 00:37:09,707
That's correct.

561
00:37:09,875 --> 00:37:11,915
Or it was, until last night.

562
00:37:12,375 --> 00:37:14,415
At 03:10 exactly,

563
00:37:14,583 --> 00:37:18,457
your general
breached our outer line of defense.

564
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:22,124
By attacking our bases,
he broke his city's neutrality.

565
00:37:22,291 --> 00:37:24,374
He is a direct threat to it.

566
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:28,165
As Governor of Paris,
I am sole in charge of our response.

567
00:37:29,375 --> 00:37:33,249
You see a crime, Consul?
I see only an act of war.

568
00:37:34,541 --> 00:37:37,332
The Allied advance
allows you to raze the city?

569
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,290
It's clearly the best riposte
I can give them.

570
00:37:41,958 --> 00:37:45,499
With no concern for relations
between France and Germany?

571
00:37:45,666 --> 00:37:47,207
What relations?

572
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:50,332
The bond between neighboring peoples.

573
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,999
Don't delude yourself.
By destroying Paris,

574
00:37:53,166 --> 00:37:56,249
you demolish
any future bilateral relationship.

575
00:37:56,416 --> 00:37:58,457
We're not at that stage yet.

576
00:37:58,625 --> 00:37:59,957
Of course we are.

577
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:02,790
It's your duty to consider the future.

578
00:38:02,958 --> 00:38:03,832
My duty?

579
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:05,582
As a German and human being.

580
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:07,332
You're quite wrong!

581
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:11,415
My duty is to lead my men to victory,
by all means possible.

582
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,374
Everything else
is absolutely irrelevant.

583
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,749
Frankly, I don't understand you.
You can't let this happen.

584
00:38:18,916 --> 00:38:20,707
Paris doesn't belong to you.

585
00:38:20,875 --> 00:38:24,082
When will you stop
seeing Paris as a French city?

586
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:28,624
If the Parisians had defended it,

587
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:30,624
or even burned it!

588
00:38:31,625 --> 00:38:35,290
As the Russians burned Moscow
to stop Napoleon. But no!

589
00:38:36,291 --> 00:38:40,040
They gave it to us,
legs wide open, like a whore.

590
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:46,124
The city is ours.
We do with it as we please.

591
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,290
Paris belongs to no one.

592
00:38:48,708 --> 00:38:52,249
Are you here as Swedish consul
or mayor of the city?

593
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,582
Neither.
Tonight, I am simply Raoul Nordling.

594
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,082
Fine.

595
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,749
Now listen to me very carefully,
Mr. Raoul Nordling.

596
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,582
I'll be very clear with you.

597
00:39:05,958 --> 00:39:08,040
You won't make me change my mind.

598
00:39:09,958 --> 00:39:12,999
I have received orders,
I will obey them.

599
00:39:13,166 --> 00:39:15,832
- At the cost of thousands of lives?
- Absolutely.

600
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,290
- And an irreplaceable city?
- Yes.

601
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:22,374
Meanwhile, I'll keep you here.

602
00:39:22,541 --> 00:39:26,540
Then, I advise you to leave this city
as fast as possible.

603
00:39:26,708 --> 00:39:29,207
There. I have nothing more to say.

604
00:39:55,166 --> 00:39:56,790
I was wrong.

605
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:01,582
I was wrong about you, General.
And about myself.

606
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:07,249
I was sure I could dissuade you
from doing something so crazy but...

607
00:40:09,291 --> 00:40:12,999
I clearly overestimated my capabilities.

608
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:22,957
So, we'll never see that dome again.

609
00:40:26,041 --> 00:40:29,415
No more Louvre,
no more Place de la Concorde.

610
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:35,082
No more children playing in the parks.

611
00:40:35,958 --> 00:40:38,207
No more towers of Notre-Dame.

612
00:40:39,916 --> 00:40:42,707
Everything must go. Forever.

613
00:40:46,291 --> 00:40:49,207
And you have no remorse?

614
00:40:49,375 --> 00:40:50,374
No.

615
00:40:52,916 --> 00:40:54,790
What kind of man are you?

616
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:59,040
All for what?
You know destroying Paris is pointless.

617
00:40:59,208 --> 00:41:01,874
It's gratuitous. Purely gratuitous.

618
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:05,540
Germany has lost the war.
You've lost too.

619
00:41:05,708 --> 00:41:07,957
What are you talking about now?

620
00:41:08,125 --> 00:41:11,915
Don't pretend otherwise.
You fought in Russia, Italy, Normandy...

621
00:41:12,083 --> 00:41:15,332
You're looking down the barrel.
On all fronts.

622
00:41:16,625 --> 00:41:20,415
Sooner or later, the Allies
will reach Germany and then what?

623
00:41:20,583 --> 00:41:24,082
The Red Army is in Poland,
headed for Romania and Hungary.

624
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,499
You'll be surrounded

625
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,790
and it will be all over.

626
00:41:28,250 --> 00:41:30,499
Look out there,
look at the city,

627
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,749
and tell me if it's worth it.

628
00:41:34,083 --> 00:41:35,832
It's out of the question.

629
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:38,874
You'd rather not look
reality in the eye?

630
00:41:39,083 --> 00:41:41,874
Whose reality? Yours or mine?

631
00:41:42,041 --> 00:41:44,999
The reality
that destroying Paris is absurd.

632
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:45,832
Yours then.

633
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:48,540
Not mine alone.
The world is watching you.

634
00:41:48,750 --> 00:41:51,582
In the end, you,
General Dietrich von Choltitz,

635
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:53,582
will be held responsible.

636
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:54,665
All for what?

637
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:58,457
To delay the Allied attack on Germany
for a few weeks?

638
00:41:58,625 --> 00:42:00,165
It makes no sense.

639
00:42:03,625 --> 00:42:07,915
I understand that you have your orders
and must obey them.

640
00:42:08,375 --> 00:42:12,249
But surely, at some point,
obedience ceases to be a duty.

641
00:42:15,541 --> 00:42:17,332
In your whole career,

642
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,249
have you never had a doubt or even...

643
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:23,332
a hesitation

644
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:25,624
over the legality of an order?

645
00:42:25,791 --> 00:42:27,582
Even if that were the case,

646
00:42:27,750 --> 00:42:30,540
I have no right to incite uncertainty
among my men

647
00:42:30,708 --> 00:42:32,790
through my own insubordination.

648
00:42:33,875 --> 00:42:37,582
A general at the front
must be a model for his troops.

649
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:43,790
Hans...

650
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:47,082
Wire this to HQ.

651
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,165
What about my call to Berlin?

652
00:42:55,166 --> 00:42:58,082
The blast should blow the bridge away,

653
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,457
like a cyclone.

654
00:43:00,166 --> 00:43:03,749
As it's steel,
we need to add 30 kg of explosives.

655
00:43:03,916 --> 00:43:07,457
Right there and there,
where they intersect, okay?

656
00:43:09,041 --> 00:43:11,540
- Is the damage fixed?
- Changed and checked.

657
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:12,999
Line, please!

658
00:43:14,208 --> 00:43:15,832
Communications still down.

659
00:43:16,583 --> 00:43:17,374
Shit!

660
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:19,832
I'll try from the roof.

661
00:43:33,166 --> 00:43:35,999
You remind me of Abraham.

662
00:43:36,208 --> 00:43:37,332
Who?

663
00:43:38,083 --> 00:43:39,832
Abraham, in the bible.

664
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,124
When God orders him to kill his son,
Abraham obeys.

665
00:43:43,291 --> 00:43:45,624
He sharpens his knife,
builds an altar,

666
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:47,749
raises his arm to stab Isaac,

667
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,957
never expecting
God to intervene at the last.

668
00:43:52,208 --> 00:43:54,207
How can one justify doing that?

669
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:57,707
By claiming he was doing God's will
or feared His wrath?

670
00:43:57,875 --> 00:44:00,457
But that misses the point, which is,

671
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:03,707
what child
would want a father like that?

672
00:44:04,916 --> 00:44:08,624
If not for its beauty or people,
save Paris for you, your soldiers

673
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:09,707
and Germany!

674
00:44:10,125 --> 00:44:10,832
For Germany?

675
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,499
Believe me,

676
00:44:12,875 --> 00:44:16,165
if you destroy Paris,
it will be a disaster for Germany.

677
00:44:17,666 --> 00:44:21,165
The repercussions of such a crime
go beyond the war.

678
00:44:21,333 --> 00:44:23,915
Germany will be made an outcast.

679
00:44:24,333 --> 00:44:26,290
Your children

680
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:31,332
and those of the survivors
will wear the swastika in their flesh.

681
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,665
Just as others
currently wear yellow stars.

682
00:44:38,125 --> 00:44:40,874
You certainly are a fine talker.

683
00:44:42,208 --> 00:44:43,707
Abraham...

684
00:44:44,958 --> 00:44:46,082
A Jew.

685
00:44:47,916 --> 00:44:49,915
It's an interesting analogy.

686
00:44:53,333 --> 00:44:57,374
I no longer believe in God,
but I remember the bible well.

687
00:44:59,000 --> 00:45:01,082
In fact, you're asking me

688
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:05,290
to betray the oath I took
to serve my country.

689
00:45:05,625 --> 00:45:09,040
You're asking me
to betray my whole upbringing.

690
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:13,374
My father was a soldier.
My grandfather was also a soldier.

691
00:45:13,541 --> 00:45:16,749
My ancestors fought Napoleon
in his Russian campaign.

692
00:45:16,916 --> 00:45:18,999
And I have been in two wars.

693
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:21,249
Let me finish.

694
00:45:22,166 --> 00:45:24,457
I saw everything in those wars.

695
00:45:25,666 --> 00:45:30,082
The intoxication of victory
and the humiliation of defeat.

696
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:34,249
I, too, want this one to end,
the sooner the better.

697
00:45:34,416 --> 00:45:36,707
But I will never capitulate.

698
00:45:37,875 --> 00:45:40,749
If Hitler told you
to kill your little boy,

699
00:45:40,916 --> 00:45:42,332
you wouldn't hesitate?

700
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,332
Like Abraham, 4,000 years ago?

701
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:46,249
You're becoming insolent.

702
00:45:47,125 --> 00:45:49,624
You hardly leave me any choice.

703
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:10,749
- We're here to see the General.
- Follow me.

704
00:46:15,208 --> 00:46:17,665
We bring a message
from Heinrich Himmler.

705
00:46:17,833 --> 00:46:20,749
Very well. I'll inform the General.

706
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:24,540
Where's the...

707
00:46:25,166 --> 00:46:26,457
Kitchen? Eat?

708
00:46:26,666 --> 00:46:28,290
Nothing left, can't help you.

709
00:46:28,458 --> 00:46:29,707
Show us anyway.

710
00:46:29,958 --> 00:46:31,374
Your boys, all gone.

711
00:46:31,541 --> 00:46:32,374
Show me!

712
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,707
What's the plonk?

713
00:46:35,416 --> 00:46:37,665
It's the last bottle we have. Cider.

714
00:46:37,833 --> 00:46:38,790
Open it up!

715
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:40,790
It's from Normandy.

716
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,249
Get it open, I said!

717
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:45,457
Give it here.

718
00:46:51,291 --> 00:46:51,999
Gentlemen.

719
00:46:52,166 --> 00:46:53,290
We've come from Berlin.

720
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,957
Crossed through the lines.

721
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:58,207
An absolute miracle!

722
00:46:58,375 --> 00:47:00,582
On an important mission
from Himmler.

723
00:47:02,125 --> 00:47:03,624
Concerning?

724
00:47:03,791 --> 00:47:05,540
The destruction of Paris.

725
00:47:06,666 --> 00:47:09,707
You must assign to us
a reconnaissance unit.

726
00:47:18,250 --> 00:47:21,957
That's the Louvre, is it?
Across the street?

727
00:47:22,791 --> 00:47:25,374
Himmler wants a few artworks
for safekeeping.

728
00:47:26,333 --> 00:47:28,374
You came all this way from Berlin?

729
00:47:28,666 --> 00:47:30,082
Where'd you get the fuel?

730
00:47:30,375 --> 00:47:32,082
What do you care?

731
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,124
We commandeered it.

732
00:47:35,708 --> 00:47:36,915
From fighting units?

733
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:39,040
From chickens fleeing the enemy.

734
00:47:39,833 --> 00:47:41,874
Men you allowed
to leave the city,

735
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:44,582
cowards incapable of defending it.

736
00:47:45,583 --> 00:47:47,040
The Bayeux Tapestry,

737
00:47:47,250 --> 00:47:49,790
some paintings by Rubens,
two Caravaggios,

738
00:47:49,958 --> 00:47:53,082
rolled up, without frames,
so they fit in the trunk.

739
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:54,665
And the Mona Lisa?

740
00:47:54,958 --> 00:47:56,332
Himmler only wants those.

741
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,999
Gentlemen,
I think you have arrived too late.

742
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:02,457
You refuse to obey Himmler.

743
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:05,749
Stüpnagel, your predecessor,

744
00:48:05,916 --> 00:48:07,749
will be hanged today in Berlin,

745
00:48:07,916 --> 00:48:09,332
from a meat hook.

746
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:13,165
His wife and children
will pay for his crimes also.

747
00:48:14,166 --> 00:48:16,749
I bet Paris is full of conspirators
like him.

748
00:48:16,916 --> 00:48:18,582
The blue blood club.

749
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:24,790
- Any news from Hegger?
- No, sir.

750
00:48:24,958 --> 00:48:28,582
It must be working now.
And get those guys off my back.

751
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:30,540
Lieutenant...

752
00:48:32,208 --> 00:48:33,457
Thank you.

753
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,165
Gentlemen,

754
00:48:41,416 --> 00:48:43,207
Paris is one huge time-bomb.

755
00:48:43,375 --> 00:48:45,665
In a few minutes, it will explode.

756
00:48:45,833 --> 00:48:48,582
All the bridges, Notre-Dame,

757
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:51,457
Invalides, the Eiffel Tower...

758
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:53,832
My wife wanted a postcard of it.

759
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,082
That's all that will be left.

760
00:49:05,416 --> 00:49:06,540
May I?

761
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:07,999
Of course.

762
00:49:13,541 --> 00:49:15,832
Do you like it in Paris?

763
00:49:17,208 --> 00:49:18,874
It's better than Russia.

764
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,207
Where were you?

765
00:49:22,541 --> 00:49:25,999
In the Kharkov cauldron
with General von Choltitz.

766
00:49:59,333 --> 00:50:01,582
Do you know what Sippenhaft is?

767
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:02,457
What?

768
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:05,249
Sippenhaft.
Do you know what it is?

769
00:50:05,416 --> 00:50:06,290
No.

770
00:50:06,625 --> 00:50:10,624
It's a law, decreed
just before I arrived in Paris.

771
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,957
I'm overjoyed.

772
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,915
Shall I tell you
what the law says?

773
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,790
Since two weeks ago,

774
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,332
all German officers' families
are considered hostages.

775
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:24,124
They answer for our actions.

776
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:26,165
If Paris doesn't blow up,

777
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:30,374
my wife and children will be arrested,
incarcerated and executed.

778
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:34,999
You find it hard to believe?

779
00:50:35,875 --> 00:50:36,874
Here...

780
00:50:37,625 --> 00:50:40,832
The decree
signed in person by Adolf Hitler.

781
00:50:54,333 --> 00:50:57,207
Germany is scared, Consul.

782
00:50:58,166 --> 00:51:01,790
To fight back, it resorts
to the worst medieval practices.

783
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:05,332
Blind, unconditional obedience.

784
00:51:07,166 --> 00:51:08,290
Enter!

785
00:51:15,416 --> 00:51:16,374
Gentlemen...

786
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:24,207
The owner's private stock,
from the cellar.

787
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:34,124
Very good.

788
00:51:36,666 --> 00:51:40,999
Would you care for a bite to eat?
Or a cigarette?

789
00:51:50,375 --> 00:51:52,499
We also have a camembert.

790
00:51:53,291 --> 00:51:54,457
Thank you.

791
00:51:55,666 --> 00:51:56,665
Miss...

792
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:02,124
Gentlemen.

793
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:09,082
I have destroyed
a dozen towns in this war,

794
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:11,374
mostly out of strategic objectives.

795
00:52:11,583 --> 00:52:15,124
I did so
with absolutely no qualms,

796
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:16,957
because it was necessary.

797
00:52:17,291 --> 00:52:21,540
I am aware that the destruction of Paris
won't win us the war,

798
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:23,540
but I love my children.

799
00:52:26,791 --> 00:52:28,874
My surrender sentences them to death

800
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:31,957
and I doubt God will intervene
to save them.

801
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:34,457
By obeying orders,
I save their lives.

802
00:52:40,791 --> 00:52:43,082
Were I to disobey,

803
00:52:43,250 --> 00:52:46,124
what child
would want a father like me?

804
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:52,957
Allow me to return the question.

805
00:52:53,791 --> 00:52:56,249
What would you do in my shoes?

806
00:52:59,041 --> 00:52:59,749
Pardon me?

807
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:02,457
What would you do in my shoes?

808
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,707
In your shoes?

809
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:09,374
- Well...
- Go ahead.

810
00:53:12,875 --> 00:53:15,457
Hundreds of thousands of lives
are at stake,

811
00:53:15,666 --> 00:53:17,457
including women and children.

812
00:53:18,458 --> 00:53:19,790
It's a simple question.

813
00:53:19,958 --> 00:53:21,999
What would you do in my shoes?

814
00:53:25,291 --> 00:53:28,499
You'd sacrifice
your wife and loved ones

815
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,249
for a city you hardly know?

816
00:53:33,083 --> 00:53:34,165
Well?

817
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:35,665
Hold on...

818
00:53:36,625 --> 00:53:38,957
I need an answer.
I need one now.

819
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:41,249
What would you do in my shoes?

820
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:43,249
Answer me, will you?

821
00:53:45,416 --> 00:53:46,790
Answer me!

822
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:49,582
I don't know.

823
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,332
Just as I thought.

824
00:53:52,791 --> 00:53:53,874
Enter!

825
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:56,457
I've been sent by Colonel Jay.

826
00:53:57,250 --> 00:53:58,415
General, listen...

827
00:53:58,666 --> 00:54:00,915
Get out. Stand ready.

828
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:02,874
We'll find a way...

829
00:54:03,083 --> 00:54:04,707
I told you, I won't surrender.

830
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,290
Think of the consequences.

831
00:54:06,458 --> 00:54:09,290
The Americans
are on the outskirts of Paris.

832
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:11,499
Your wife can surely be...

833
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:13,915
Put me through to Hegger.

834
00:54:14,083 --> 00:54:16,915
Yes, Hegger.
At the parliament building.

835
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:19,415
We'll find a way
to get your family out.

836
00:54:19,583 --> 00:54:23,665
Baden-Baden is on the border.
They could reach Switzerland via France.

837
00:54:23,833 --> 00:54:26,999
I know a group
that will be able to help them.

838
00:54:27,166 --> 00:54:30,082
Corporal Mayer
can drive them to Strasbourg

839
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:34,665
and to the group I know.
Tomorrow, they'll be safe.

840
00:54:34,916 --> 00:54:38,374
I can't get through to Hegger.
The field telephone's dead.

841
00:54:41,958 --> 00:54:44,624
With the French engineer
to guide you.

842
00:54:44,791 --> 00:54:48,082
It's just across the Seine.
The parliament building.

843
00:54:48,416 --> 00:54:50,624
The parliament building, yes.

844
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:55,957
<i>I must speak with him personally.</i>

845
00:54:56,166 --> 00:54:58,040
<i>Take a radio with you.</i>

846
00:54:59,250 --> 00:55:01,165
Yes, sir. I'm on my way.

847
00:55:06,375 --> 00:55:07,957
Watch out! Sniper!

848
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:14,624
I can get them across the border,
at no risk.

849
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:18,332
One word from you
and tomorrow they'll be in Switzerland.

850
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:22,374
Why do you think
Sippenhaft was decreed

851
00:55:22,541 --> 00:55:24,957
the day before I was posted here?

852
00:55:25,833 --> 00:55:27,582
A pure coincidence? No.

853
00:55:27,750 --> 00:55:29,999
It's a law aimed at me personally.

854
00:55:30,166 --> 00:55:34,040
My family can't leave Baden-Baden
without the Gestapo after them.

855
00:55:34,208 --> 00:55:36,624
They'll be arrested,
incarcerated and executed.

856
00:55:39,208 --> 00:55:41,415
It could be worse, couldn't it?

857
00:55:41,791 --> 00:55:44,082
They could be sent to the camps.

858
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:48,415
Ravensbrück.
Are you familiar with that name?

859
00:55:49,291 --> 00:55:52,415
Believe me,
in some cases, death is preferable.

860
00:55:53,208 --> 00:55:55,915
You did your duty
by coming this far.

861
00:55:56,083 --> 00:55:58,332
Now, let me do mine.

862
00:55:58,916 --> 00:56:00,165
If you'd be so kind...

863
00:56:20,666 --> 00:56:21,749
The pill bottle...

864
00:56:21,916 --> 00:56:22,790
Sorry?

865
00:56:23,416 --> 00:56:25,874
The bottle in my desk.
In the drawer.

866
00:56:26,041 --> 00:56:28,249
- Which one?
- Near the phone.

867
00:56:28,416 --> 00:56:29,332
Hurry!

868
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:39,874
- How many?
- Two. Two pills.

869
00:56:46,583 --> 00:56:47,415
Here.

870
00:56:54,125 --> 00:56:55,082
Breathe deeply.

871
00:56:55,250 --> 00:56:56,832
Long, deep breaths.

872
00:56:58,333 --> 00:56:59,457
Come with me.

873
00:57:18,625 --> 00:57:20,165
Drink this.

874
00:57:20,708 --> 00:57:21,749
Thank you.

875
00:57:27,625 --> 00:57:29,665
This is grotesque. I'm sorry.

876
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:31,374
No, not at all.

877
00:57:31,833 --> 00:57:34,332
It's this damn asthma that...

878
00:57:34,500 --> 00:57:37,374
I've had it for years
and with the heat, it...

879
00:57:39,208 --> 00:57:41,415
You should keep your pills on you.

880
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:42,874
Thanks.

881
00:57:45,791 --> 00:57:47,374
How do you feel?

882
00:57:48,291 --> 00:57:49,374
Exhausted.

883
00:57:58,625 --> 00:57:59,665
Move!

884
00:58:04,291 --> 00:58:05,915
- Which way now?
- This way.

885
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:07,957
Can we trust him?

886
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:09,624
You have a better idea?

887
00:58:16,125 --> 00:58:18,040
Forget the war a moment.

888
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:25,082
Picture yourself in five years
on this balcony.

889
00:58:26,166 --> 00:58:29,290
It's one day in the week,
just another day...

890
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:34,999
You hear the horns of tugboats
coming up the Seine,

891
00:58:36,958 --> 00:58:40,457
glaziers and clothes merchants
hawking their wares,

892
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:44,082
a newspaper vendor
shouting out headlines...

893
00:58:46,541 --> 00:58:49,707
You hear the swish
of the broom bristles,

894
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:53,749
scraping the sidewalk
with a noise like an ocean tide.

895
00:58:55,750 --> 00:58:59,707
It's in the bold light of March,
or misty November.

896
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:02,374
It is Paris
as you've never seen it,

897
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:06,582
nothing like occupied Paris
5 years earlier.

898
00:59:12,625 --> 00:59:15,582
You come from Baden-Baden
with wife and children

899
00:59:15,750 --> 00:59:18,749
and you think,
I, General Dietrich von Choltitz,

900
00:59:18,958 --> 00:59:22,582
one day in August '44,
might have put an end to this.

901
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:24,124
But I didn't.

902
00:59:28,291 --> 00:59:31,957
What will you feel, do you think,
at that precise moment?

903
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:37,665
Generals often
have the power to destroy,

904
00:59:38,125 --> 00:59:40,540
rarely the power to edify.

905
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:46,332
Paris would owe its existence
to you alone.

906
00:59:51,375 --> 00:59:52,874
Is that not worth

907
00:59:53,583 --> 00:59:55,915
all the glory due a conqueror?

908
01:00:30,500 --> 01:00:32,582
You are a fine advocate,

909
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:36,040
but if I ever return
and your capital is still standing,

910
01:00:36,208 --> 01:00:38,165
I'll be traveling alone.

911
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:42,624
My wife and children won't be with me
to admire your city.

912
01:00:45,583 --> 01:00:47,540
Why get me back on my feet?

913
01:00:47,750 --> 01:00:48,957
Pardon me?

914
01:00:49,458 --> 01:00:52,332
You came to my aid.
I'd like to understand why.

915
01:00:52,916 --> 01:00:54,540
What's to understand?

916
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:57,165
You could've let me choke to death.

917
01:00:58,625 --> 01:01:01,374
I am a diplomat, not a soldier,
as you said.

918
01:01:01,541 --> 01:01:03,624
Death is not my business.

919
01:01:05,666 --> 01:01:10,082
Paris has only one ace in its hand
to save it from destruction.

920
01:01:11,500 --> 01:01:12,374
You.

921
01:01:12,541 --> 01:01:15,207
The Nazis here would blow it up
in a flash,

922
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:17,457
but you're not like them.

923
01:01:18,291 --> 01:01:19,999
How would you know?

924
01:01:21,708 --> 01:01:25,165
You asked me what I'd do
in your shoes. I'll tell you.

925
01:01:26,208 --> 01:01:29,665
For nothing in the world
would I want to be in your shoes.

926
01:01:29,875 --> 01:01:33,832
It's not the destruction of a city
but of millions of people.

927
01:01:35,375 --> 01:01:37,374
Until now, you have managed

928
01:01:37,541 --> 01:01:39,999
to keep intact your self-respect.

929
01:01:40,791 --> 01:01:43,749
If you carry out
the orders of that tyrant,

930
01:01:44,625 --> 01:01:46,290
believe me,

931
01:01:47,166 --> 01:01:49,207
you'll lose it forever.

932
01:01:54,875 --> 01:01:57,040
General, should we get in position?

933
01:01:57,416 --> 01:01:58,082
What?

934
01:01:58,250 --> 01:01:59,957
The enemy's at the city gates.

935
01:02:00,125 --> 01:02:01,290
And Bressensdorf?

936
01:02:01,458 --> 01:02:03,540
He hasn't reported back yet.

937
01:02:03,750 --> 01:02:05,624
Thank you. Leave us now.

938
01:02:07,833 --> 01:02:10,124
Sir, there's only 20 of us here.

939
01:02:11,333 --> 01:02:12,540
And so?

940
01:02:13,791 --> 01:02:18,457
Should we set up defenses downstairs,
on the roof or on this floor?

941
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:21,040
How old are you?

942
01:02:21,208 --> 01:02:22,249
Eighteen.

943
01:02:24,083 --> 01:02:27,624
All men under 20
must leave the city.

944
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:32,207
We're all under 20,
except 3 or 4 of us.

945
01:02:32,916 --> 01:02:35,915
They stay with me
and you others go.

946
01:02:36,666 --> 01:02:37,832
Yes, sir.

947
01:02:38,125 --> 01:02:38,749
Thank you.

948
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:46,915
My men are scared.

949
01:02:48,208 --> 01:02:50,790
They're kids. It's not their war.

950
01:02:52,375 --> 01:02:54,457
It's no longer yours, either.

951
01:02:55,916 --> 01:02:58,374
It's that of a man alone,
aging, fading,

952
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,707
fooling himself and fooling others.

953
01:03:01,916 --> 01:03:03,582
A man reduced to blackmail,

954
01:03:03,750 --> 01:03:07,915
demanding inhuman obedience
of his generals to commit crimes.

955
01:03:09,208 --> 01:03:10,290
Hitler.

956
01:03:11,958 --> 01:03:14,457
The man had a gift, you know.

957
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:19,249
He had a gift for captivating you,
giving you confidence

958
01:03:19,416 --> 01:03:22,707
and making you believe
in Germany's historic destiny.

959
01:03:23,708 --> 01:03:24,665
And today?

960
01:03:25,500 --> 01:03:26,207
Today...

961
01:03:26,375 --> 01:03:29,207
Your superiors tried to assassinate him.
Why?

962
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:32,249
I can't imagine
they attempted it for no reason.

963
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:35,374
I played no part in their plot.

964
01:03:36,875 --> 01:03:39,499
You must have an idea.
You knew them all.

965
01:03:39,666 --> 01:03:41,999
They weren't revolutionaries
or fanatics.

966
01:03:42,166 --> 01:03:44,124
So why try to kill him?

967
01:03:45,083 --> 01:03:46,874
They were a step ahead.

968
01:03:47,875 --> 01:03:48,874
Sorry?

969
01:03:49,750 --> 01:03:52,915
They were in contact with Hitler.
I wasn't.

970
01:03:57,166 --> 01:03:59,749
Two weeks
after the assassination attempt,

971
01:04:00,250 --> 01:04:02,124
I was summoned to Rastenburg,

972
01:04:02,291 --> 01:04:04,040
Hitler's headquarters.

973
01:04:05,291 --> 01:04:07,624
I was ready to renew my trust,

974
01:04:07,791 --> 01:04:10,624
to continue to believe
we had a chance.

975
01:04:12,083 --> 01:04:13,790
But the man I saw

976
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:17,749
was absolutely not
the man I once knew.

977
01:04:18,583 --> 01:04:21,415
He was slobbering at the mouth.

978
01:04:21,875 --> 01:04:25,082
His face was wracked
with spasms and...

979
01:04:26,208 --> 01:04:27,707
The eyes...

980
01:04:30,541 --> 01:04:31,874
Those eyes.

981
01:04:36,041 --> 01:04:39,207
When I left Rastenburg,
I had made up my mind

982
01:04:39,500 --> 01:04:43,749
not to obey his orders to the letter,
to avoid unnecessary bloodshed.

983
01:04:43,916 --> 01:04:47,957
But since then, there is this ax
over my children's heads.

984
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:51,332
Today,
I have no other way of saving them.

985
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:56,290
Just one question.

986
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:58,999
If you surrender Paris
without resistance,

987
01:04:59,166 --> 01:05:00,957
what exactly will happen?

988
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:04,082
Sorry, I wasn't listening.

989
01:05:04,250 --> 01:05:05,749
If you don't destroy Paris,

990
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:08,582
what will be the consequences?
A debacle?

991
01:05:10,375 --> 01:05:12,332
Something like that, yes.

992
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:15,874
The frontline north of the Seine
will be shattered,

993
01:05:16,250 --> 01:05:18,707
with the Allies
free to strike at the Reich.

994
01:05:20,125 --> 01:05:22,957
And the immediate repercussions?
What happens next?

995
01:05:23,125 --> 01:05:24,332
If Paris falls,

996
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:28,249
how will Germany and the army react
when they find out?

997
01:05:29,625 --> 01:05:33,415
With astonishment, at first.
But soon it will be total panic.

998
01:05:33,833 --> 01:05:34,915
Panic?

999
01:05:35,083 --> 01:05:37,665
So, risk sending your family
to Switzerland.

1000
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:39,790
The impact of your capitulation

1001
01:05:39,958 --> 01:05:43,290
means your wife and children
won't be Hitler's priority.

1002
01:05:43,458 --> 01:05:46,624
That will give us a few days to act.

1003
01:05:46,916 --> 01:05:49,707
If I capitulate,
I'll be arrested immediately.

1004
01:05:49,875 --> 01:05:51,415
How can I do anything then?

1005
01:05:51,916 --> 01:05:53,624
Leave it all to me.

1006
01:05:55,791 --> 01:05:56,874
To you?

1007
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:01,249
What guarantees do I have?

1008
01:06:02,250 --> 01:06:04,290
You have two.
First, Caporal Mayer.

1009
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:07,582
He drives your family
from Baden-Baden to Strasbourg,

1010
01:06:07,750 --> 01:06:11,999
on to Mulhouse, around the Jura,
to Annemasse, in Haute-Savoie.

1011
01:06:12,291 --> 01:06:15,582
Driving all night,
they'll be there tomorrow morning.

1012
01:06:15,750 --> 01:06:17,707
Why not go straight to Basle?

1013
01:06:20,333 --> 01:06:23,624
It's closer, true,
but the border's tightly guarded.

1014
01:06:24,625 --> 01:06:26,915
From Annemasse,
it's quicker and safer.

1015
01:06:27,083 --> 01:06:29,540
No mountains to climb,
the border's a formality...

1016
01:06:29,708 --> 01:06:32,374
Your family
will be in Geneva in no time.

1017
01:06:32,541 --> 01:06:35,290
And that's where Chantecler is based.

1018
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:36,415
That group

1019
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,874
is your second guarantee.

1020
01:06:39,291 --> 01:06:41,707
How far is Annemasse from the border?

1021
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:44,915
Under a kilometer.

1022
01:06:45,083 --> 01:06:46,124
Altitude?

1023
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:47,665
400 meters, at most.

1024
01:06:47,833 --> 01:06:49,832
- No mountains to climb?
- None.

1025
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:52,290
Your family won't be the first.

1026
01:06:52,458 --> 01:06:54,457
It's not a difficult route.

1027
01:06:55,791 --> 01:06:56,915
You'll go with them?

1028
01:06:57,083 --> 01:07:01,249
Up to the border. I'll wait
for confirmation they're in Switzerland.

1029
01:07:03,666 --> 01:07:06,915
Chantecler?
Never heard of that group.

1030
01:07:07,083 --> 01:07:10,540
Thank God!
Or your family wouldn't stand a chance.

1031
01:07:10,708 --> 01:07:13,749
There's no risk, I promise you.

1032
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:19,499
I need to be sure.

1033
01:07:19,666 --> 01:07:21,040
I require solid proof.

1034
01:07:22,750 --> 01:07:26,082
I've already
used their services twice before.

1035
01:07:26,375 --> 01:07:27,249
You?

1036
01:07:28,625 --> 01:07:30,207
To what ends?

1037
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,707
To help a French family,
some time ago.

1038
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:37,499
And more recently...

1039
01:07:38,125 --> 01:07:39,207
My wife.

1040
01:07:39,666 --> 01:07:41,499
Your wife? I don't understand.

1041
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:45,624
My wife is Jewish, Mr. Choltitz.

1042
01:07:46,083 --> 01:07:48,707
She lives in Lausanne now.
In safety.

1043
01:07:53,541 --> 01:07:56,332
I'd like to help you further but...

1044
01:07:58,208 --> 01:08:01,374
I cannot put myself in your shoes.

1045
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:28,624
Lieutenant Bressensdorf!

1046
01:08:29,625 --> 01:08:31,040
First Lieutenant Hegger?

1047
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:32,249
That's me.

1048
01:08:32,791 --> 01:08:33,749
Are you ready?

1049
01:08:33,916 --> 01:08:35,707
Sure. We just need the order.

1050
01:08:35,875 --> 01:08:37,290
That's why I'm here.

1051
01:08:37,666 --> 01:08:40,290
Guys, Paris gets
its firework display!

1052
01:08:40,625 --> 01:08:42,540
I need to confirm I'm here.

1053
01:08:43,375 --> 01:08:44,540
Confirm?

1054
01:08:45,625 --> 01:08:48,207
It only works up on the roof.

1055
01:08:48,458 --> 01:08:49,540
To the roof, then.

1056
01:08:49,708 --> 01:08:50,790
The General too.

1057
01:08:50,958 --> 01:08:52,749
Fine. The General too.

1058
01:08:53,708 --> 01:08:54,624
Who's he?

1059
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:56,124
My guide.

1060
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,290
Clear out!

1061
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:36,707
Listen carefully.

1062
01:09:42,416 --> 01:09:43,665
Just a moment.

1063
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:02,749
That's my final order.

1064
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:28,457
Operation canceled.

1065
01:10:28,625 --> 01:10:30,457
Paris won't explode.

1066
01:10:41,166 --> 01:10:42,832
Shit! Dammit!

1067
01:10:43,000 --> 01:10:44,665
We worked our asses off!

1068
01:10:44,833 --> 01:10:48,082
3 days and nights,
without eating, shitting or sleeping!

1069
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:50,874
All for nothing? Not a chance.

1070
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:52,540
3, 6 and 9, in position.

1071
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:54,082
Hegger!

1072
01:10:55,291 --> 01:10:56,999
Yes, 2nd Lieutenant?

1073
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,790
Can it!

1074
01:11:27,791 --> 01:11:30,082
In Annemasse, give her this.

1075
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:32,874
Engraved with our wedding date.

1076
01:11:35,166 --> 01:11:36,249
She'll believe you.

1077
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:43,540
My loved ones are in your hands.

1078
01:11:45,666 --> 01:11:48,582
Nothing will happen to them.
I give you my word.

1079
01:11:51,750 --> 01:11:52,790
Well...

1080
01:11:53,500 --> 01:11:55,499
My career ends here.

1081
01:11:56,791 --> 01:11:58,665
Everything will be fine.

1082
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:03,874
Being the man who didn't destroy Paris
is a real credit to you.

1083
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:09,874
Let's have a drink, shall we?

1084
01:12:10,458 --> 01:12:15,082
You have an excellent whisky
tucked away in this cabinet.

1085
01:12:16,416 --> 01:12:18,374
How do you know?

1086
01:12:18,666 --> 01:12:21,207
Rest assured, I won't tell the Brits.

1087
01:12:22,166 --> 01:12:24,957
You like it straight, don't you?

1088
01:12:26,083 --> 01:12:28,624
You're a funny fellow, Mr. Nordling.

1089
01:12:30,625 --> 01:12:33,249
Is there anything you don't know?

1090
01:12:35,125 --> 01:12:36,832
About what, General?

1091
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:38,457
About me.

1092
01:12:39,541 --> 01:12:40,290
You?

1093
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:43,082
I must make a confession.

1094
01:12:43,250 --> 01:12:47,207
The mirror over the fireplace
is a two-way mirror.

1095
01:12:50,166 --> 01:12:51,665
Miss Howard was a flirt

1096
01:12:51,833 --> 01:12:54,707
and Napoleon III
was either as jealous as a tiger

1097
01:12:54,875 --> 01:12:57,707
or a terrible voyeur, right?

1098
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,749
I'd say he was a terrible voyeur.

1099
01:13:02,208 --> 01:13:04,290
And I'd agree with you.

1100
01:13:06,458 --> 01:13:09,540
To the courtesan
who led me to you.

1101
01:13:15,333 --> 01:13:16,749
You're leaving?

1102
01:13:17,833 --> 01:13:19,415
I think it's time.

1103
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:26,582
Wait!

1104
01:13:27,916 --> 01:13:31,624
You need a safe-conduct
or you'll never reach Annemasse.

1105
01:13:31,791 --> 01:13:34,707
The German army
still holds half of France.

1106
01:13:36,958 --> 01:13:38,165
Excuse me.

1107
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:46,290
Hotel Meurice, yes.

1108
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:53,457
The French!

1109
01:13:54,458 --> 01:13:55,415
A problem?

1110
01:13:55,583 --> 01:13:58,165
No, it's Parisian humor,
I suppose.

1111
01:13:58,333 --> 01:14:01,332
A man asking to book a room tonight.

1112
01:14:03,333 --> 01:14:06,415
You think
they'll all take turns to call?

1113
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:17,999
Another reservation?

1114
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:21,332
No, that one wanted to see me dead.

1115
01:14:22,708 --> 01:14:25,332
I fear he's in the majority.

1116
01:14:36,958 --> 01:14:39,457
Hurry, you've no time to waste.

1117
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,624
Thank you, General.

1118
01:14:46,666 --> 01:14:47,957
Church bells?

1119
01:14:49,541 --> 01:14:52,124
Who are they burying at this time?

1120
01:14:54,041 --> 01:14:56,457
I guess Paris is burying
the Occupation.

1121
01:14:56,666 --> 01:14:59,999
The bells announce
the Allies' entry into Paris.

1122
01:15:00,166 --> 01:15:02,040
So, they're tolling for me.

1123
01:15:06,333 --> 01:15:07,749
Farewell, General.

1124
01:15:49,333 --> 01:15:49,999
General...

1125
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:52,040
Mayer?

1126
01:15:52,541 --> 01:15:55,165
We were stopped 20 km from here.

1127
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:56,332
I'm sorry.

1128
01:15:57,125 --> 01:15:59,665
An enemy roadblock,
impossible to get past.

1129
01:16:00,541 --> 01:16:02,415
They opened fire on us.

1130
01:16:03,083 --> 01:16:05,665
You have to get to Baden-Baden!

1131
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:12,957
You don't understand.

1132
01:16:13,583 --> 01:16:15,499
They weren't there by chance.

1133
01:16:15,666 --> 01:16:17,124
They were French

1134
01:16:17,583 --> 01:16:19,540
and they were all over us.

1135
01:16:19,708 --> 01:16:22,457
Without Alfred at the wheel,
we'd be dead.

1136
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:24,040
The Resistance?

1137
01:16:54,583 --> 01:16:55,915
Men...

1138
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:02,874
One last time, we must fight together.

1139
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:07,915
As a soldier among soldiers,
I shall be at your side.

1140
01:18:51,791 --> 01:18:53,124
