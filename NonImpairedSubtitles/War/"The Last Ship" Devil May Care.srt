00:39:29,052 --> 00:39:29,951
Outstanding.

657
00:39:30,053 --> 00:39:31,719
Sir, I recommend we search east to west.

658
00:39:31,822 --> 00:39:33,779
That'll put the morning sun behind us.

659
00:39:33,882 --> 00:39:35,627
Very well.
Set a course, all ahead, full.

660
00:39:35,729 --> 00:39:36,500
Aye, sir.

661
00:39:38,683 --> 00:39:40,016
Six hours to the deadline.

662
00:39:40,118 --> 00:39:41,684
Let's make 'em count.

663
00:39:55,032 --> 00:39:59,033
Michael Slattery, Captain,
United States Navy.

664
00:39:59,135 --> 00:40:04,110
Serial number 17181120.

665
00:40:05,975 --> 00:40:08,074
I rewatched the video.

666
00:40:08,176 --> 00:40:09,557
Very clever.

667
00:40:10,146 --> 00:40:12,125
And very stupid.

668
00:40:18,153 --> 00:40:21,137
You have led your friends
to their deaths.

669
00:40:23,257 --> 00:40:25,491
[Computers beeping]

670
00:40:48,615 --> 00:40:51,448
Approaching the first island now, sir.

671
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:54,685
CIC, Bridge. I want full power, sonar.

672
00:40:54,787 --> 00:40:57,221
Peng's subs could be lurking.

673
00:41:00,626 --> 00:41:04,628
[Sonar pinging]

674
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,504
Sensor mine! Sensor mine!

675
00:41:15,607 --> 00:41:17,640
- [Alarm blaring]
- Pull engines back, full!
