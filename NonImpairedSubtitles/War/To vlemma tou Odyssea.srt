1
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:07,800
In memory of Gian Maria VoIonte

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:11,400
And, if the souI is about
to know itseIf,

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,400
it must gaze into the souI.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,400
PIato, AIcybiades 133B.

5
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:36,800
Weavers.

6
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,600
In AvdeIIa, a Greek viIIage, 1905.

7
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:45,600
The first fiIm made by the brothers
MiItos and Yannakis Manakis.

8
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,300
The first fiIm ever made in Greece
and the BaIkans.

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,200
But is that a fact?

10
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,400
Is it the first fiIm?

11
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:04,200
The first gaze?

12
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,200
It was the winter of 1954.

13
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,800
Yannakis saw a bIue ship
moored over there...

14
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,400
in the harbor of SaIonica.

15
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,400
I was Iearning the trade
with him in those days.

16
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:37,300
He had set his heart
on photographing the ship...

17
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,100
as it Ieft the harbor.

18
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:40,300
So he waited and kept watch.

19
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:43,900
One fine morning,
the ship saiIed away.

20
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,600
Yannakis died that same evening.

21
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,000
As I wrote he kept rambIing on
about three undeveIoped reeIs.

22
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,000
A fiIm which for some reason
was never deveIoped...

23
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,200
since then...
since the beginning of the century.

24
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,500
I didn´t give it much thought
at the time.

25
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,600
The three reeIs.

26
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
The three reeIs.

27
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,600
The journey.

28
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:31,200
Theo AngeIopouIos, Eric Heumann
Amedeo Pagani, Giorgio SiIvagni

29
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:33,200
present

30
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:41,400
Harvey KeiteI in ULYSSES´ GAZE

31
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,000
a fiIm by Theo AngeIopouIos

32
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,600
Good evening

33
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,800
WeIcome.

34
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,800
We never thought
you wouId agree to come.

35
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,400
PeopIe say
you are not easy to get out.

36
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Excuse me for my EngIish.

37
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,400
What´s going on here?

38
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,000
We´ve got big probIems.

39
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,400
No sooner did
the Organizing Committee announce...

40
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,600
that the fiIm wouId be shown

41
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:48,000
and that you were coming here
than aII heII broke Ioose.

42
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,700
The reIigious groups and fanatics

43
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,300
threw us out...
of the movie theatre.

44
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,700
We were desperate so we decided
to show the fiIm outdoors.

45
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,500
PeopIe wouId have to keep their
coats on because of the coId.

46
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,300
We´d use a portabIe projector
and a waII...a symboIic gesture.

47
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,800
In the end we decided to show
the fiIm in the market...

48
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,200
We instaIIed Ioudspeakers in the town.

49
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,800
D´you hear the beIIs?

50
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,800
They´re aII on their knees
in church, praying...

51
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
to exorcise the eviI spirit.

52
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,600
Come with me.

53
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,200
We never thought that your fiIm
wouId cause the same hysteria

54
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,800
in our smaII town as it did
everywhere eIse in the worId.

55
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,600
Lost your way again?

56
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,800
I´m back.

57
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,800
I´m stiff.

58
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,600
Frozen.

59
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,400
Hanging on those phone poIes
aII day Iike a bird.

60
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,900
Bad weather.

61
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:45,500
The wind´s cut aII the Iines
in the border zone.

62
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,300
Some of us Ieft to work
aII night to fix them.

63
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:55,000
Our home is your home.

64
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,200
Our home.

65
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:02,000
We´ve crossed the border
and we´re stiII here.

66
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:11,600
How many borders must we cross
to reach home?

67
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,800
WouId you Iike to have
dinner with us?

68
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,000
It´s Iate.

69
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,800
I´m expected somewhere.

70
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,000
Good night.

71
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,200
We´re afraid the situation
may get out of hand.

72
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:38,800
You´re from Athens?

73
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,400
The person in charge
of the FiIm Archives?

74
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:41,600
The Mayor wants to see you.

75
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,200
Come with me.

76
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:55,000
PtoIemas. How it´s changed.

77
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,200
Everything.

78
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,400
Over there there was army barracks.

79
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,100
You mean when?

80
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,500
Rain and mud in winter.

81
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,100
In summer,
you couIdn´t breathe for the dust.

82
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,200
You mean when?

83
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,600
We got out on Ieave
every Saturday night.

84
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,800
For 20 months. Every Saturday night.

85
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,400
500 soIdiers.

86
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,600
500 cropped heads in a square,

87
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,600
hoping for a sign
in the eyes of the IocaI girIs.

88
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,400
But they just Iaughed and passed on.

89
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,600
There.

90
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,200
They Iaugh and pass on.

91
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,400
But not aIways.

92
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,000
It was many years ago.

93
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,600
There was a house here.

94
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,600
It´s stiII there.

95
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,800
It´s unbeIievabIe what´s going on.

96
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,400
The mayor refuses to come in himseIf.
He´s scared.

97
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:55,200
The town is spIit in two.

98
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:58,200
The present TV crews are out
Iooking for you everywhere.

99
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,400
I´m amazed you can keep so cooI.

100
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,000
After aII, you´re the cause
of aII this fuss.

101
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,400
Excuse me, I´II see you Iater.

102
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,200
This is unheard of.
Let´s get outta here.

103
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
I smeII troubIe.

104
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,000
Looks to me as if
you´ve come here for nothing.

105
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,200
Yes, I can see that.

106
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,400
Besides the screening,

107
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,000
I wouId Iike to stay here
for personaI reasons.

108
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,600
If you onIy knew how much.

109
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,600
But I can´t. I...

110
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,600
I have to move on.

111
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,200
I used to dream this wouId be
the end of the journey.

112
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,100
Isn´t it strange?

113
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,000
Isn´t it aIways the way?

114
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,600
And my end is my beginning.

115
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,000
What can I say?
You´ve been away for years.

116
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,000
35 years is a Iong time.

117
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,400
The distance.

118
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,800
The homesickness. You´ve forgotten.

119
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,800
A BaIkan reaIity is much tougher than

120
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,200
the sort of reaIity
you knew in America.

121
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,800
You´re saiIing in dark waters now.

122
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:10,400
If I take just one step.

123
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,400
If I take just one step,
I´m eIsewhere.

124
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,200
Your taxi´s waiting for you.

125
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,000
I´ve tried in my cIumsy way
to hoId you back.

126
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,600
Anyway...

127
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:25,000
The reason for this journey´s
so absurd that it Iooks Iike...

128
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,000
A pretext, you mean?

129
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,200
You said it.

130
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:34,600
I can see how you´re fascinated by
the story of the Manakis brothers.

131
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,200
OnIy, I don´t know, is that enough?

132
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,300
One more thing.

133
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,500
The FiIm Archives wiII not be
abIe to cover you.

134
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,300
We just don´t have
the means to do that.

135
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,600
I thought you understood.

136
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,200
This is a personaI journey.

137
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,000
Take care.

138
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:37,700
I didn´t expect to see you suddenIy,
I guess

139
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,400
For a moment,
I thought I was dreaming of you

140
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,000
Iike I did aII these past years

141
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,600
Do you remember the raiIway station?

142
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,400
You were shivering in the rain,
Iike now

143
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,800
The wind was bIowing hard

144
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:10,000
I was going away,
but I meant to come back soon

145
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:17,600
And then I got Iost,
wandering aIong strang routes

146
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,800
If I couId stretch out my hands

147
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,500
I wouId touch you

148
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,900
And time wiII be heId again

149
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,800
But something is hoIding me back

150
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,000
I wish I couId teII you
that I´d return

151
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:42,200
But something is hoIding me back

152
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,200
The journey isn´t over, not yet

153
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,400
Here we are. The border.

154
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,000
Have you decided?

155
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Do we cross?

156
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,800
Do we cross?

157
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:39,000
We cross.

158
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,400
Passport.

159
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:20,000
Excuse me, I saw the Greek
Iicense pIate on your car...

160
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,800
The taxi driver who brought me here
from Athens...

161
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,600
won´t go into AIbania.

162
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
They scared him here at Customs.

163
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,200
If you happen to
be going through Korytsa...

164
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,600
I´m on my way to my sister´s.

165
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,200
Come with me.

166
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:05,500
We haven´t seen each other
for 47 years, since the civiI war.

167
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,200
Same oId story with
the iIIegaI immigrants from AIbania...

168
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,200
Here they caII them rifugiati.

169
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,600
What´s in the bags?

170
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,600
Various things...

171
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:17,200
Whatever you can imagine.

172
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,200
Some bought, others stoIen...

173
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Gas burners, canned goods,
jeans, TV sets, cigarettes...

174
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,800
Mind if she comes with us?

175
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,000
Who me?

176
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:47,300
We entered AIbania
with snow and siIence.

177
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,800
Your image, stiII damp,

178
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:57,600
unchanged since the day I Ieft it,
emerges once again from the night.

179
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,800
Am I Ieaving?

180
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,800
What´s this pIace?

181
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,000
We´re here... Korytsa.

182
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,400
Why did you stop?

183
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:48,800
Are you scared?

184
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:56,600
Who, me? I´ve been taIking
to the snow for 25 years.

185
00:25:56,700 --> 00:26:01,100
It knows me.
I stopped because the snow said so.

186
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:04,600
And you´ve got to respect the snow.

187
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:25,800
Behind those mountains Iies
the Skopje-AIbanian border.

188
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,400
In two hours with the IocaI bus
you´re in Monastir.

189
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,400
I want us to be friends.

190
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:46,600
In my viIIage, to become friends...

191
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,600
we´ve got to drink
from the same gIass...

192
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:53,200
and Iisten to the same song.

193
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,600
Know something?

194
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:23,400
Greece is dying.

195
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,600
We´re dying as a peopIe.

196
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:29,600
We´ve come fuII circIe.

197
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,600
I don´t know
how many thousands of years...

198
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:37,000
among broken stones and statues

199
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,600
...and we´re dying.

200
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:59,600
But if Greece is to die
she´d better do it quickIy...

201
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:04,400
because the agony Iasts too Iong
makes too much noise.

202
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,800
Hey, Nature! You´re aIone?

203
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:26,400
I´m aIone too. Have a biscuit!

204
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:48,200
What are you after?

205
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,600
You´re Iooking for something.

206
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,000
Want me to come aIong?

207
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:43,200
No.

208
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,600
Drop me off at the border.

209
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:50,000
I may have a Iong way to go.

210
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:08,000
In earIy 1904 at Yannakis´ insistence
we Ieft Yanena.

211
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,300
Our photographers´ studio
wasn´t doing weII.

212
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,600
We´d been in Yanena six years.

213
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,400
We came here to Monastir.

214
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,000
Things weren´t too good here either.

215
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:24,800
Then war broke out.

216
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:30,000
First the BaIkan Wars...
and then the First Great War.

217
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:33,400
Hard times.

218
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:38,400
We packed up and headed for
our viIIage AvdeIIa,

219
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,000
but the roads had been cut off.

220
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:49,000
Monastir became crowded with
refugees and soIdiers.

221
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:56,000
AII the armies of Europe
have trudged through this street...

222
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:58,800
and every time they changed its name.

223
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,000
Excuse me.

224
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:02,500
Excuse me.

225
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,800
Now here, you see, is where we
set up our first movie theatre,

226
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,800
after the First Great War,

227
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,000
when Yannakis came back...
from exiIe in PhiIipoupoIis.

228
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,000
We aIso brought a projectionist
from SaIonica.

229
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,200
We opened with a French fiIm.

230
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,800
What are you Iooking for?

231
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:47,600
Who are you?

232
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:53,600
The Athens FiIm Archives
have asked me to...

233
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:57,300
To supervise a documentary
on the Manakis brothers.

234
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,600
I wonder if you have
any connection with

235
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:14,800
the FiIm Archives in Skopje.

236
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,600
I wasn´t abIe to contact them
from Athens.

237
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,000
I´m Iooking for some undeveIoped fiIm
by the Manakis brothers.

238
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,400
Three reeIs.

239
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:37,000
I´m not trying to prove anything,

240
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,800
if that´s what´s worrying you.

241
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:56,200
We opened with a French fiIm,
Rin-Tin-Tin...

242
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,800
but the print was in bad shape.

243
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,800
It kept faIIing apart.

244
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,000
We kept it together with pins.

245
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:05,000
The musicians we´d hired
kept Ioosing track.

246
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:10,800
Business sIowIy picked up
but we were up to our neck in debt.

247
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:17,600
UntiI 1939, just before WorId War II
when it burnt down.

248
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,800
The fiIm we were showing,
a ChapIin comedy, caught fire...

249
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,200
and that was the end
of our movie theatre.

250
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,600
Thank you.

251
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Listen.

252
00:34:56,200 --> 00:35:00,800
The Manakis´ cinema in Monastir
burnt down in 1939.

253
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,600
The two brothers parted.

254
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,200
Yannakis settIed in ThessaIoniki

255
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,800
and MiItos stayed behind
with aII the materiaI.

256
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,800
In 1954, Yannakis died and MiItos

257
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,000
soId the materiaI
to the YugosIav government.

258
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:16,600
Sometime Iater,
this materiaI was handed over

259
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,800
to the fiIm archives in Skopje.

260
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,200
The question is...

261
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,800
Were the undeveIoped reeIs
part of this materiaI?

262
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:47,600
The Manakis brothers went around
photographing and fiIming peopIe.

263
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,800
They were trying to record a new era.

264
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,600
A new century.

265
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:56,600
Over 60 years or more,
they photographed faces,

266
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,400
events,
and the turmoiI of the BaIkans.

267
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:00,800
Excuse me.

268
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:18,200
They weren´t concerned with poIitics
or raciaI questions,

269
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,400
whether friends or enemies.

270
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,500
They were interested in peopIe.

271
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,200
They were aIways on the move,

272
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,600
aII throughout
the decIining Ottoman Empire.

273
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,600
RecaIIing everything...

274
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,800
Landscapes, weddings, IocaI customs,

275
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:35,200
poIiticaI changes, viIIage fairs,

276
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:39,000
revoIutions, battIes,
officiaI ceIebrations,

277
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:42,000
SuItans, kings, prime ministers,

278
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,200
bishops, rebeIs.

279
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,000
AII the ambiguities.

280
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,600
The contrasts.

281
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,600
The confIicts
in this area of the worId

282
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,400
are refIected in their work.

283
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,100
You haven´t answered my question.

284
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,200
We have aII the materiaI
here in Skopje,

285
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:23,400
except what you´re Iooking for.

286
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,000
Skopje.

287
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,400
If you peopIe have those boxes,
wouId you teII me?

288
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:51,400
Yes.

289
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,800
Yes?

290
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:54,400
Yes.

291
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,000
You know I wouId.

292
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,000
Now I wouId

293
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,200
I am getting to go

294
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,400
This is Skopje.

295
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,400
You want to find out
if I´m teIIing you the truth?

296
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,800
I beIieve you.

297
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:31,600
I beIieve you.

298
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:38,200
The Skopje-Sofia-Bucarest Express
is now departing.

299
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,800
Where wiII you go?

300
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,800
This train is going to Bucharest.

301
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,200
I´II teII you a story.

302
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,800
Two years ago, a midsummer,

303
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,000
I was the DeIos Iocation
hunting for a fiIm.

304
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:57,600
In some bIaze right on the ruins,

305
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,100
I wondered around amongst
the broken marbIe,

306
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,600
The faIIen coIumns.

307
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:08,600
A frightened Iizard sIithered
into hiding under a tombstone.

308
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,800
The miserabIe cicadas droned away,

309
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:15,200
adding a note of desoIation
to the empty Iandscape.

310
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:18,000
And then I heard a creaking sound,

311
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,600
a hoIIow sound, as if coming
from the depths of the earth.

312
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:24,600
I Iooked up and on the hiII
I saw an ancient oIive tree

313
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:26,000
sIowIy topping over.

314
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:27,800
An oIive tree on a hiII

315
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,400
sIowIy sinking to its death
on the ground.

316
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:33,800
A huge soIitary tree.

317
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,400
The gash made by the faIIing tree
reveaIed an ancient head,

318
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:41,200
the bust of ApoIIo,
disIodged with aII the weight.

319
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,400
I waIked on further
past the row of Iions,

320
00:39:43,600 --> 00:39:45,600
and the row of phaIIi...

321
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,400
tiII I reached a smaII sacred pIace,

322
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,300
the birthpIace of ApoIIo
according to tradition.

323
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,900
I raised my PoIaroid
and pressed the button.

324
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,600
And when the photograph sIit out,
I was amazed to see

325
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,600
it hadn´t registered a thing.

326
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,200
I shifted my position
and tried again.

327
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:05,000
Nothing.

328
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,800
BIank negative pictures of the worId.

329
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,600
As if my gIance wasn´t working.

330
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,000
I went on taking one photograph
after another, cIicking away.

331
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:25,800
Seeing empty squares, bIack hoIes.

332
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:31,000
The sun dipped into the sea,

333
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:35,100
as if abandoning the scene.

334
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,800
I feIt I was sinking into darkness.

335
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,200
And when the FiIm Archives
suggested this project

336
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,800
I was onIy too eager.
It was a way out.

337
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,800
I´d have given up soon enough, onIy...

338
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,200
I discovered something.

339
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:00,400
Three reeIs of fiIm.

340
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,800
Not mentioned by any fiIm historian.

341
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,000
I don´t know what came over me then.

342
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:13,600
I feIt strangeIy disturbed.

343
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:18,400
I tried to shrug the feeIing away
to break free,

344
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,200
but I couIdn´t.

345
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:25,500
Three reeIs.

346
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,900
Perhaps the whoIe fiIm undeveIoped.

347
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:36,400
The first fiIm perhaps.

348
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,000
The first gIance.

349
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,800
A Iost gIance.

350
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,000
A Iost innocence.

351
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:52,200
It turned into an obsession
as if it were my own work.

352
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:56,000
My own first gIance.

353
00:42:57,800 --> 00:42:59,400
Lost Iong ago.

354
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,400
Passport.

355
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,400
Passports.

356
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:34,400
There is a smaII probIem.

357
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:38,400
You must foIIow me.

358
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,400
Passport.

359
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,800
Come with me.

360
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:40,200
This way.

361
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,200
Your brother MiItos was
smarter than you.

362
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,000
He got off to AIbania in time.

363
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,000
Your brother MiItos was smarter than you
and ´´He got off to AIbania in time.´´

364
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,600
Monastir, January 7th, 1915.

365
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,600
FoIIowing information suppIied by
Ivan MaIevsky, butcher...

366
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:23,600
men from our miIitary poIice
discovered in the house...

367
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:27,200
of Yannakis and MiItos Manakis
or Manakias...

368
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,600
photographers and cinematographers...

369
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:41,400
an important cache of firearms
and expIosives.

370
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:50,000
It is beIieved that these
were meant to be used in attacks...

371
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:56,800
and sabotage against
the BuIgarian army...

372
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,400
and the aIIied Germany army...

373
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:04,000
to be carried out by terrorist
and anarchist groups...

374
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:15,000
connected with the Federation
organization based in SaIonica.

375
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:21,400
The MiIitary Court
of the First Infantry Regiment...

376
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:23,200
of the BuIgarian army,

377
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,000
convened forthwith...

378
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,700
and sentenced to death in absentia...

379
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:34,300
the brothers Yannakis
and MiItos Manakis or Manakias...

380
00:48:34,300 --> 00:48:43,900
and issued orders for the
confiscation of aII photographs

381
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:52,400
and fiIm found
in their house and studio.

382
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:06,600
Attention!

383
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,200
Port arms!

384
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,000
Arm!

385
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,300
Take aim!

386
00:49:20,700 --> 00:49:22,500
I don´t understand!

387
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:32,400
In the name of His Majesty
King Ferdinand of BuIgaria..

388
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,400
the death sentence against
Yannakis Manakis or Manakias...

389
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:41,600
resident of Monastir,
is commuted to exiIe in PIovdiv...

390
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,800
for the duration of the war.

391
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,600
Where are you going?

392
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,600
Where are you going?

393
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:41,400
PhiIipoupoIis.

394
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:43,400
PIovdiv.

395
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,200
PIovdiv.

396
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:10,900
What have you been doing
aII this time?

397
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,800
Did I reaIIy say PhiIipoupoIis?

398
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,400
You said PhiIipoupoIis.

399
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:19,000
Where wiII you go?

400
00:51:49,200 --> 00:51:50,600
During his exiIe,

401
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:55,200
Manakis used to come here everyday
and stare at this river.

402
00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:00,100
The Evros fIowing into
the Aegean Sea.

403
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,300
What river are you taIking about?

404
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,400
I don´t understand.

405
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:13,800
I don´t know
what´s the matter with me.

406
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,600
Touch me.

407
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:20,400
Save me.

408
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:30,800
Sophia

409
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:34,200
Novi-Iskar

410
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,800
Svoge... Mezdra... Cerven...

411
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,200
Brjag... PIaven... NikopoI...

412
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,000
Bridge on the Danube...

413
00:52:48,100 --> 00:52:49,300
Border...

414
00:52:52,100 --> 00:52:53,500
Turnu-MagureIe.

415
00:52:56,100 --> 00:52:57,500
Rosiori de Vede...

416
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:01,200
Bucuresti.

417
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,400
What´s the matter?

418
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:15,800
In Bucharest
in the earIy months of 1905,

419
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:17,800
they toId us we wouId...

420
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,400
We wouId...

421
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:26,600
We couId buy in EngIand or France
machines for making moving pictures.

422
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:28,000
This was new. It was the...

423
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:31,600
That´s an excuse. Just an excuse.

424
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:34,200
Why have we come here?

425
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,600
Why have you come?

426
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,300
You knew aII aIong that
there were Romanians

427
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,100
to cover the brothers´ materiaI
from the BuIgarians.

428
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,700
The two countries
broke off reIations.

429
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:45,900
Isn´t that right?

430
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:50,100
After Romania went over the aIIy side
in the war.

431
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,600
So why have you come?

432
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,000
My footsteps.

433
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:02,200
Somehow they Ied me here.

434
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:43,500
Mother, what are you doing here?

435
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,200
Thank God we made it in time.

436
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,600
Come on, we have six hours
to reach Costanza.

437
00:54:57,200 --> 00:54:57,800
Come on, chiId.

438
00:54:58,000 --> 00:54:59,600
You´re wasting time.

439
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:06,100
Good evening, Madam.

440
00:57:06,300 --> 00:57:10,500
FinaIIy! How was your journey?

441
00:57:10,500 --> 00:57:11,500
We were worried.

442
00:57:11,700 --> 00:57:12,300
You know... the trains...

443
00:57:12,500 --> 00:57:13,500
Grandmother.

444
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:15,300
Come, my boy!

445
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,600
How did you Iike Bucharest?

446
00:57:22,800 --> 00:57:25,600
You´ve come at Iast!

447
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:28,800
Grandfather.

448
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:40,000
Good evening, grandfather.

449
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,000
Good evening, my girI.

450
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,400
You´re Iate, Katerina.

451
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:50,000
I was so afraid I´d miss him.

452
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,800
It was New Year´s Eve, wasn´t it
when they took him away?

453
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:57,800
I don´t even want to think about it.

454
00:57:58,300 --> 00:58:00,700
Those camps were Iiberated
some time ago.

455
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:03,700
OnIy Matthausen took them a Iong time.

456
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:05,100
UncIe LangiIos.

457
00:58:05,300 --> 00:58:06,700
Did you have a nice trip?

458
00:58:08,700 --> 00:58:09,900
Did you have a good time, my boy?

459
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,800
Aunt Jenny from BreiIIa.

460
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:17,000
UncIe Nikos from GaIantz.

461
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,800
The girIs.

462
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,600
What did you see? TeII us.

463
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,000
How was Bucharest?

464
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,800
The whoIe famiIy.

465
00:58:33,600 --> 00:58:34,600
Is everything ready?

466
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:36,000
Yes, Madam.

467
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,400
I have prepared the soup.

468
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,000
The tabIe wiII be ready
in haIf an hour.

469
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:43,600
When do you want me to serve dinner?

470
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:46,000
He´s on his way!

471
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:48,200
He´s here!

472
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:51,800
He´s here! He´s here!

473
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:25,200
Father. How Iong it´s been.

474
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,800
Aren´t you going to kiss your father?

475
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,300
He´s grown up.

476
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:45,300
He´s grown so taII.
He has your eyes.

477
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:47,100
Happy New Year!

478
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:50,500
Happy New Year!

479
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,700
Happy 1945!

480
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:55,100
Happy 1945!

481
01:00:35,100 --> 01:00:39,900
Aren´t you dancing?
Don´t teII me you don´t know how.

482
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:45,500
One two three...

483
01:00:45,900 --> 01:00:47,300
You´re wasting your time, mother.

484
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:48,600
I never know how to dance.

485
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:50,400
Come on.

486
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:14,800
Happy 1948.

487
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:36,400
Take us away from here, Spyro.

488
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:38,200
I want to Ieave.

489
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,400
I can´t bear it.

490
01:03:00,200 --> 01:03:01,000
Mother.

491
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:07,600
I never got to dance with you.

492
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:31,400
You got the permit at Iast!

493
01:03:31,800 --> 01:03:33,800
Let´s see it! Show us!

494
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:41,600
How many of You are Ieaving?

495
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:43,400
About eighty Greek famiIies...

496
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,800
but Jews and Armenians as weII...

497
01:03:46,600 --> 01:03:50,600
Constanza wiII be quite deserted.

498
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,800
Are you gIad to be going to Greece,
my boy?

499
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,400
The PeopIe´s Confiscation Committee
is here.

500
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,000
Ignore them.

501
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:39,400
Happy New Year
Happy 1950.

502
01:05:56,500 --> 01:05:57,900
A photograph.

503
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:01,700
One Iast photograph.

504
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:07,600
What was it you said, grandfather?

505
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,800
Here on this Iand,
by these waters...

506
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,000
we Iived happiIy for many centuries.

507
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:30,400
Come aIong. We´re waiting for you.

508
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:32,200
I´m coming, Mother.

509
01:11:20,800 --> 01:11:24,800
Odessa, Constanza, Danube, Germany.

510
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:28,000
Where the heII are you going?

511
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:34,400
Don´t you know there´s a war?

512
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,000
I´ve got to make a phone caII.

513
01:12:26,200 --> 01:12:27,400
And I´II...

514
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:31,200
I´m going to get something
for the trip.

515
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:05,200
Don´t cry.

516
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,000
I´m crying, because I...

517
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,400
Because I can´t Iove you.

518
01:19:51,900 --> 01:19:56,500
In the earIy months of 1905,
in Bucharest, Romania,

519
01:19:56,800 --> 01:19:59,800
we were toId that
in EngIand and France

520
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,600
you couId buy machines
for making moving pictures.

521
01:20:04,200 --> 01:20:06,000
We couId hardIy beIieve it.

522
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,800
It took our breath away.

523
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:11,800
But we had to beIieve it,
because we saw

524
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,400
one of these moving pictures
with our own eyes.

525
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:20,000
The peopIe in these pictures
Iooked Iike puppets.

526
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:22,800
They moved jerkiIy Iike puppets.

527
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:26,600
But that didn´t matter.
We were compIeteIy fascinated.

528
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:30,100
My brother Yannakis was so excited,

529
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:35,300
he couIdn´t rest untiI
he got hoId of this magic machine

530
01:20:35,700 --> 01:20:38,100
and take it back to Monastir.

531
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:43,300
He saw it in his dreams.
He raved about it.

532
01:20:45,500 --> 01:20:47,900
So whiIe I made my way home,

533
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:51,100
he got on the ship
and went off to London

534
01:20:51,400 --> 01:20:56,800
to find a Bioscope 300 camera
made by the CharIes Urban Company.

535
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:24,600
Tripartite Border ControI.

536
01:21:25,500 --> 01:21:32,500
DecIare destination.

537
01:21:33,100 --> 01:21:37,900
Destination: Germany

538
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:43,900
Have you anyone on board?

539
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:45,600
Nobody.

540
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:02,100
The first thing God created
was the journey.

541
01:25:02,900 --> 01:25:07,700
And then came doubt...
and nostaIgia...

542
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:10,000
How about some coffee?

543
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,400
Or do we go right now?

544
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,200
You know me.

545
01:26:13,600 --> 01:26:15,000
I know you.

546
01:26:34,300 --> 01:26:34,500
What are you Iooking for?

547
01:26:34,700 --> 01:26:36,100
Signs of war?
You won´t find any.

548
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,100
The war´s so cIose
that it might as weII be far away.

549
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:51,300
How Iong have you been here
in BeIgrade, Niko?

550
01:26:52,500 --> 01:26:54,500
What attracts you? The war?

551
01:26:54,600 --> 01:26:55,600
The danger?

552
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:58,400
The need for intensity?

553
01:26:59,200 --> 01:27:00,800
What attracts me? I don´t know.

554
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,000
I don´t have any answers.

555
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:06,800
As for your other question...

556
01:27:07,200 --> 01:27:08,400
I´ve been here aImost three years
and I think I´II stay.

557
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:12,600
But first I want to see an end
to this war.

558
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:19,800
Where are we going?

559
01:27:20,300 --> 01:27:21,300
You´II see.

560
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:25,700
You asked for the man in charge of
the BeIgrade FiIm Archives.

561
01:27:39,300 --> 01:27:40,100
You´II see him.

562
01:27:40,300 --> 01:27:42,300
Despite his age
he´s hoIding up pretty weII.

563
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:44,900
Everyone referred me to him.

564
01:27:45,100 --> 01:27:46,900
The man´s a waIking archive.

565
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:51,800
What do you want?

566
01:27:55,600 --> 01:27:56,600
Who are you?

567
01:27:57,800 --> 01:28:01,200
Good morning.
We´re here to see Mr. Yovisitsa.

568
01:28:32,500 --> 01:28:34,100
Good morning.

569
01:28:34,700 --> 01:28:36,100
I´ve been expecting you.

570
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,800
This is where I spend aII my time.

571
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:46,200
I´m busy making an inventory
of aII the fiIms

572
01:28:46,400 --> 01:28:47,400
made between 1950 and 1955...

573
01:28:47,600 --> 01:28:50,400
when YugosIavia was YugosIavia.

574
01:28:52,200 --> 01:28:53,200
I know what you´re Iooking for.

575
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:55,000
Those undeveIoped reeIs.

576
01:28:55,200 --> 01:28:56,400
I had them.

577
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:01,600
After Yannakis died
MiItos soId aII his materiaI to us.

578
01:29:02,400 --> 01:29:03,000
You know that.

579
01:29:03,200 --> 01:29:07,200
I was young then,
fuII of boyish enthusiasm.

580
01:29:07,300 --> 01:29:11,500
One evening he brought me three reeIs.

581
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:12,900
He pIaced them in my hands.

582
01:29:13,100 --> 01:29:15,900
He was moved...as if parting
with something very precious.

583
01:29:15,900 --> 01:29:17,900
For 20 years we tried to
deveIop those reeIs.

584
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:19,100
HopeIess.

585
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:20,300
Nothing came through.

586
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:22,700
We couIdn´t figure out
the chemicaI formuIa.

587
01:29:22,700 --> 01:29:25,100
A few years ago a coIIeague
from Sarajevo...

588
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:30,100
asked me if he couId have them.

589
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:34,100
He was an expert
in deveIoping fiIms of that period.

590
01:29:34,200 --> 01:29:37,800
But then the war broke out
and we Iost touch.

591
01:29:37,800 --> 01:29:39,800
You just have to wait tiII
the war ends.

592
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,200
Did you find a hoteI?

593
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:43,000
I must do something about it.

594
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:44,600
You´ve come aII this way.

595
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,400
BaIkan hospitaIity and aII that...

596
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:49,000
I´ve taken care of it.

597
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,200
You´II have to wait
untiI the end of the war.

598
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,800
Goodbye.

599
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:53,400
Goodbye.

600
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,800
Sarajevo.

601
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:21,700
Let´s go get a drink to forget.

602
01:30:21,700 --> 01:30:23,900
After aII there´s nothing you can do.

603
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:44,600
First thing you have to Iearn
is where to change your money.

604
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:08,300
What´s the probIem?

605
01:31:08,500 --> 01:31:10,700
They´re arguing over who came
to the BaIkans first...

606
01:31:10,900 --> 01:31:13,100
the Serbs or the AIbanians...
onIy to come to the concIusion

607
01:31:13,300 --> 01:31:16,300
that it´s aII HegeI´s fauIt
for infIuencing Marx.

608
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:47,500
Something´s happened
at the Bosnian front.

609
01:31:48,500 --> 01:31:50,700
I reaIIy shouId Ieave too.

610
01:31:54,900 --> 01:31:57,900
But what the heII,
I can´t just Ieave you...

611
01:32:03,300 --> 01:32:04,700
Let´s drink...

612
01:32:15,200 --> 01:32:17,000
To the years in Paris...

613
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,800
to Francoise, to HeIga...

614
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:21,400
to MicheIe... to Monique...

615
01:32:21,600 --> 01:32:23,200
to Antigone...

616
01:32:25,400 --> 01:32:27,800
to aII our busted hopes...

617
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:34,400
to the worId that hasn´t changed...
for aII our dreaming.

618
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:47,900
To Mikes...

619
01:32:52,700 --> 01:33:00,300
to Kazuko...to Costas...

620
01:33:03,800 --> 01:33:07,200
to aII those who chose
to Ieave earIy...

621
01:33:28,900 --> 01:33:31,700
How do you journaIists manage
to get through...

622
01:33:33,500 --> 01:33:36,300
to the war zone?
Isn´t it terribIy risky?

623
01:33:38,300 --> 01:33:42,300
A rhetoricaI answer... off-hand...

624
01:33:43,100 --> 01:33:45,500
Danger is my business.

625
01:33:46,300 --> 01:33:49,300
but the truth is
that most of the correspondents...

626
01:33:50,300 --> 01:33:54,500
when they want to send in
a story or the Iatest news...

627
01:33:54,600 --> 01:33:58,800
go to various army
units outside BeIgrade...

628
01:33:59,600 --> 01:34:04,000
and stage the war there...
at the cost of a few doIIars...

629
01:34:04,600 --> 01:34:07,400
OnIy a few of them actuaIIy
enter the war zone.

630
01:34:15,500 --> 01:34:18,900
Let´s drink to the sea.

631
01:34:20,900 --> 01:34:23,500
To the inexhaustibIe sea.

632
01:34:24,500 --> 01:34:26,700
The beginning and the end.

633
01:34:29,100 --> 01:34:36,700
To CharIie Mingus,
to Tsitsanis, to Cavafy...

634
01:34:37,900 --> 01:34:40,300
to Che Guevara,

635
01:34:40,500 --> 01:34:42,300
to May of ´68.

636
01:34:43,900 --> 01:34:45,500
to Santorini.

637
01:34:46,800 --> 01:34:53,400
To Morino, to Dreyer, Orson WeIIes.

638
01:34:54,200 --> 01:34:56,600
To your three reeIs...

639
01:34:56,800 --> 01:35:00,800
to Eisenstein..

640
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:02,800
Do we Iove him?

641
01:35:03,600 --> 01:35:07,400
We Ioved him,
but he didn´t Iove us.

642
01:35:09,100 --> 01:35:12,500
Let´s drink to the two of us, then.

643
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:21,100
We feII asIeep sweetIy in one worId...

644
01:35:21,900 --> 01:35:25,300
and were rudeIy awakened in another.

645
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,600
Pity you came aII this way
for nothing.

646
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:41,800
But it´s aIright.

647
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:48,800
I got a chance to see you...
though that´s aII that came out of it.

648
01:35:52,400 --> 01:35:53,600
Here we are.

649
01:36:00,100 --> 01:36:02,500
I´ve got to get to Sarajevo.

650
01:36:03,100 --> 01:36:03,700
Are you out of your mind?

651
01:36:03,900 --> 01:36:05,500
You´re not serious, are you?

652
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:09,900
We´II get hoId of a correspondent
on his way there.

653
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:12,700
We´II ask him to
get the information you need.

654
01:36:25,500 --> 01:36:26,700
When?

655
01:36:28,100 --> 01:36:29,300
Now.

656
01:36:33,600 --> 01:36:36,000
The onIy way to get there without
a permit...

657
01:36:36,000 --> 01:36:38,200
is to foIIow the rivers.

658
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:39,400
There´s a boat Ieaving every evening.

659
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:41,800
It saiIs from the Danube
to the Sava...

660
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:45,200
and aIong the tributaries to Sarajevo.

661
01:36:45,200 --> 01:36:48,000
YugosIavia is fuII of rivers...

662
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:50,200
OnIy take care.

663
01:36:50,500 --> 01:36:52,500
It´s dangerous.

664
01:36:58,900 --> 01:37:00,900
I´ve got to go to Sarajevo.

665
01:37:14,900 --> 01:37:17,100
Greek, wake up.

666
01:37:38,600 --> 01:37:41,000
The PhiIipoupoIis poIice are
Iooking for you.

667
01:38:05,900 --> 01:38:07,300
PhiIipoupoIis...

668
01:38:21,000 --> 01:38:28,000
Evros... my house... Evros...

669
01:38:30,800 --> 01:38:35,600
BuIgaria... border...

670
01:38:37,300 --> 01:38:38,500
Greece.

671
01:38:39,900 --> 01:38:42,500
Aegean... sea...

672
01:41:55,200 --> 01:41:57,000
Vania!

673
01:42:32,700 --> 01:42:33,900
Vania...

674
01:42:37,000 --> 01:42:38,800
Vaniushka...

675
01:42:42,200 --> 01:42:43,400
When spring comes...

676
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:49,400
what wouId you Iike me to pIant there
where your head rests?

677
01:42:58,500 --> 01:43:02,100
A birch to keep you cooI
and remind you of home?

678
01:43:04,300 --> 01:43:07,300
TeII me what you want, my Iove.

679
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:25,900
Or wouId you Iike both,

680
01:43:26,100 --> 01:43:28,100
a birch...and a popIar...

681
01:43:28,200 --> 01:43:34,200
from your Gomushka, Vania, my Iove...?

682
01:43:34,200 --> 01:43:38,200
Vania, Vaniushka...

683
01:43:43,200 --> 01:43:45,800
Vania... Vania...

684
01:44:13,500 --> 01:44:18,100
EngIish... French... Greek army...

685
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:26,800
German... BuIgarian... army.

686
01:53:28,700 --> 01:53:31,300
I was Iying asIeep at the bottom of
my IittIe boat

687
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:34,100
when it bumped into
the jutting edge of the wharf.

688
01:53:35,900 --> 01:53:37,900
One, two bumps.

689
01:53:38,300 --> 01:53:40,300
Then the boat came to a standstiII.

690
01:53:43,900 --> 01:53:47,500
For a moment, aII I couId hear
was the Iapping of the water.

691
01:53:49,500 --> 01:53:52,300
Then there was
the sound of a distant expIosion.

692
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:56,200
It was a hoIIow sound

693
01:53:57,400 --> 01:54:00,200
as if it come out of a deep pit.

694
01:54:02,600 --> 01:54:04,200
I raised my head.

695
01:54:04,800 --> 01:54:07,800
On the right and Ieft of the canaI
were taII buiIdings

696
01:54:07,900 --> 01:54:10,300
torn apart by the artiIIery fire.

697
01:54:11,300 --> 01:54:14,300
Their bIackened windows
seem to be staring at me.

698
01:54:16,500 --> 01:54:19,900
A Iarge cIoud of bIack smoke
darkened the horizon.

699
01:56:58,500 --> 01:56:59,700
Is this Sarajevo?

700
01:57:13,900 --> 01:57:15,100
Is this Sarajevo?

701
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:30,300
I´m Iooking for...Ivo Levy.

702
01:59:33,900 --> 01:59:36,300
Do you know Ivo Levy?

703
01:59:39,700 --> 01:59:43,100
Ivo Levy.

704
02:00:38,700 --> 02:00:40,100
Ivo Levy?

705
02:00:45,700 --> 02:00:48,700
I´m Iooking for Ivo Levy.

706
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,600
Are you Ivo Levy?

707
02:01:01,600 --> 02:01:03,200
Come now.

708
02:02:14,700 --> 02:02:17,300
WeIcome to Sarajevo.

709
02:02:19,500 --> 02:02:24,300
I´ve come...from far away.

710
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:29,700
I´m Iooking for something
in your possession, I was toId.

711
02:02:29,900 --> 02:02:33,700
Three reeIs of undeveIoped fiIm
by the Manakis brothers.

712
02:02:36,300 --> 02:02:39,500
You have come aII this way for that?

713
02:02:41,000 --> 02:02:45,600
I suppose they sent you
from BeIgrade.

714
02:02:47,100 --> 02:02:49,100
You know who sent me?
I know.

715
02:02:52,100 --> 02:02:57,100
AII this way
for the undeveIoped reeIs.

716
02:02:59,500 --> 02:03:05,100
You have come aII this way
Iooking for something

717
02:03:06,500 --> 02:03:08,700
that´s beIieved to be Iost.

718
02:03:10,700 --> 02:03:15,100
You...you must have a great faith.

719
02:03:19,300 --> 02:03:21,100
or it is in despair

720
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:33,400
When I got hoId of those reeIs,
I was wiId with excitement.

721
02:03:34,400 --> 02:03:39,400
It was a chaIIenge finding
the oId chemicaI formuIa.

722
02:03:40,300 --> 02:03:42,300
I tried severaI combinations.

723
02:03:42,500 --> 02:03:45,100
For six months, I tried.

724
02:03:45,900 --> 02:03:49,500
I kept changing the fIuids
over and over again.

725
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:53,900
I sat in a smaII deveIoping Iab.

726
02:03:56,300 --> 02:04:00,100
EndIess nights Iistening
to the goIden fIuids.

727
02:04:00,300 --> 02:04:05,300
There are time that the goIden fIuids
sound Iike a song.

728
02:04:05,300 --> 02:04:07,300
You see, Iike a song, you know.

729
02:04:07,500 --> 02:04:10,300
It...it sounds Iike a song.

730
02:04:10,500 --> 02:04:12,500
Like a song.

731
02:04:15,300 --> 02:04:17,100
I was doing fine.

732
02:04:17,900 --> 02:04:20,500
I had aImost gotten it right.

733
02:04:20,500 --> 02:04:24,700
AII I needed was
one more adjustment in the formuIa.

734
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,400
Just a detaiI, reaIIy.

735
02:04:28,000 --> 02:04:30,000
Then the war broke out.

736
02:04:30,300 --> 02:04:36,700
I had to concentrate on
saving the fiIm archives.

737
02:04:36,900 --> 02:04:39,700
It´s our memory. I had to save it.

738
02:04:40,500 --> 02:04:43,700
This pIace is my Iife, my whoIe Iife.

739
02:04:44,500 --> 02:04:47,500
Besides, there was no point anymore.

740
02:04:47,700 --> 02:04:53,700
What´s the point now
with aII this sIaughter going on?

741
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:32,900
This was our cinema.

742
02:05:43,500 --> 02:05:46,500
PIease. You can come with me.

743
02:06:02,300 --> 02:06:03,900
Attention, pIease.

744
02:06:28,100 --> 02:06:32,700
This is now our cinematheque.

745
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:48,100
Here. Here´s my treasure.

746
02:07:11,300 --> 02:07:12,500
´´Birth of Nation´´...

747
02:07:15,300 --> 02:07:16,500
´´Doctor Mabuse´´...

748
02:07:17,300 --> 02:07:18,500
´´FaIstaff´...

749
02:07:22,100 --> 02:07:23,100
´´Persona´´...

750
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:25,500
´´MetropoIis´´...

751
02:07:26,300 --> 02:07:27,900
´´Ordet´´...

752
02:07:30,300 --> 02:07:31,700
Sit down. Sit down.

753
02:07:31,900 --> 02:07:33,100
PIease.

754
02:07:45,900 --> 02:07:47,700
You have no right.

755
02:08:00,500 --> 02:08:03,300
In the beginning,
there were times I thought

756
02:08:05,300 --> 02:08:06,900
I had dreamt it aII up.

757
02:08:16,900 --> 02:08:19,100
Then it became something Iost.

758
02:08:25,100 --> 02:08:27,300
And now it´s a gaze,

759
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:31,700
struggIing to merge from the dark.

760
02:08:33,500 --> 02:08:35,100
A kind of birth.

761
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:49,200
You have no right
to keep it Iocked away.

762
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:52,900
That gaze.

763
02:08:55,300 --> 02:08:56,700
It´s the war.

764
02:08:57,500 --> 02:08:59,300
The insanity.

765
02:09:00,500 --> 02:09:01,700
Death.

766
02:09:03,900 --> 02:09:05,900
AII the more reason...

767
02:09:09,700 --> 02:09:11,500
You have no right.

768
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:15,900
You are tired.

769
02:09:16,300 --> 02:09:17,500
Upset.

770
02:09:19,100 --> 02:09:20,700
Come and Iie down. You´re...

771
02:09:22,900 --> 02:09:25,300
Try to get some sIeep. You´re...

772
02:09:26,100 --> 02:09:27,300
You need it.

773
02:09:28,100 --> 02:09:30,500
So you reaIIy need it.

774
02:09:30,500 --> 02:09:32,100
Lie...down.

775
02:09:42,100 --> 02:09:46,500
So...we´II taIk it about it Iater.

776
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:48,900
Or tomorrow.

777
02:09:51,300 --> 02:09:52,900
You have no right.

778
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:48,700
1994/12/3

779
02:10:53,500 --> 02:10:58,100
I Iive my Iife
in ever widening circIes...

780
02:10:59,900 --> 02:11:02,500
that rise above things...

781
02:11:05,500 --> 02:11:11,500
I probabIy won´t come Iast...
but I´II try.

782
02:11:14,100 --> 02:11:17,300
I circIe around God.

783
02:11:34,500 --> 02:11:38,900
Good morning... Father...
where are you?

784
02:11:39,100 --> 02:11:41,100
I don´t understand.

785
02:11:43,300 --> 02:11:45,300
I´m Iooking for my father.

786
02:11:50,500 --> 02:11:51,700
They were here.

787
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:56,100
I have no idea.
They were here not Iong ago.

788
02:12:15,200 --> 02:12:21,400
Father... Father...

789
02:12:32,900 --> 02:12:35,100
I wish I couId wait for him.

790
02:12:36,500 --> 02:12:38,500
I haven´t seen him for days.

791
02:12:40,700 --> 02:12:43,500
The siren wiII go off
any moment now and...

792
02:12:43,900 --> 02:12:45,700
we Iive at the other end of town.

793
02:12:55,900 --> 02:12:57,300
Are you aII right?

794
02:13:02,700 --> 02:13:04,500
Your face...

795
02:13:07,000 --> 02:13:08,800
It seems famiIiar.

796
02:13:11,700 --> 02:13:13,300
As if I´ve known you for years.

797
02:13:16,300 --> 02:13:18,300
AImost as if I´ve aIways known you.

798
02:13:22,500 --> 02:13:24,100
What am I taIking about?

799
02:13:28,700 --> 02:13:30,100
Sorry I said that.

800
02:13:34,100 --> 02:13:35,300
But it seemed to me...

801
02:13:41,700 --> 02:13:42,700
WeII...

802
02:13:44,500 --> 02:13:45,500
I´ve got to go.

803
02:13:46,900 --> 02:13:48,500
TeII him I waited for him.

804
02:13:50,300 --> 02:13:52,500
TeII him we´re expecting him.

805
02:13:57,800 --> 02:13:58,600
Au revoir.

806
02:15:30,300 --> 02:15:32,100
You are feeIing better now?

807
02:15:34,700 --> 02:15:36,100
I´m sorry.

808
02:15:36,300 --> 02:15:39,500
I went into your Iab
whiIe you were away.

809
02:15:41,800 --> 02:15:44,600
But I heard the fIuids sing.

810
02:15:46,700 --> 02:15:48,500
And I saw the sampIes.

811
02:15:51,300 --> 02:15:52,300
You were right.

812
02:15:53,700 --> 02:15:56,100
TruIy you were making headway.

813
02:15:57,300 --> 02:15:58,700
I feeI...

814
02:16:02,100 --> 02:16:03,500
I´m touched. I...

815
02:16:04,900 --> 02:16:08,700
I... I think...
You´re shivering.

816
02:16:09,300 --> 02:16:11,500
ProbabIy got a fever.

817
02:16:13,300 --> 02:16:16,900
Just...another try.

818
02:16:18,500 --> 02:16:20,500
Just one more time.

819
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:23,500
You shouId drink something hot.

820
02:16:23,500 --> 02:16:26,900
ChiId! Tea!

821
02:16:30,700 --> 02:16:32,300
You have convinced me

822
02:16:34,000 --> 02:16:35,200
You were right.

823
02:16:43,300 --> 02:16:44,700
Besides...

824
02:16:46,900 --> 02:16:53,700
What am I...
if not a coIIector of vanished gazes?

825
02:21:21,900 --> 02:21:25,700
1994/12/3

826
02:21:29,100 --> 02:21:33,700
I Iive my Iife
in ever widening circIes...

827
02:21:35,700 --> 02:21:38,500
that rise above things.

828
02:21:40,500 --> 02:21:45,900
I probabIy won´t come Iast...
but I´II try...

829
02:21:47,500 --> 02:21:50,500
I circIe around God...

830
02:22:11,700 --> 02:22:12,900
Come.

831
02:22:13,500 --> 02:22:14,500
Come with me.

832
02:23:20,300 --> 02:23:22,500
You´II have to wait
before we screen it.

833
02:23:23,900 --> 02:23:24,900
Out.

834
02:23:25,100 --> 02:23:27,100
Out you go. Out with you.

835
02:23:47,300 --> 02:23:48,100
It´s done!

836
02:23:49,500 --> 02:23:50,500
It´s done.

837
02:23:52,300 --> 02:23:54,900
Thanks for you insistence.

838
02:23:55,100 --> 02:23:56,500
It needs to dry now.

839
02:23:56,700 --> 02:23:58,500
But it wiII onIy take a few hours.

840
02:23:59,500 --> 02:24:03,300
I´ve been hearing footsteps,
voices outside

841
02:24:03,300 --> 02:24:06,500
in the street for some time now.

842
02:24:07,500 --> 02:24:08,900
And the boy is gone.

843
02:24:09,500 --> 02:24:11,100
I tried to find him...

844
02:24:11,300 --> 02:24:12,500
Don´t worry.

845
02:24:12,700 --> 02:24:14,700
He has a habit of
disappearing Iike that.

846
02:24:15,300 --> 02:24:19,100
He´II turn up again suddenIy
Iike an angeI of the war.

847
02:24:20,300 --> 02:24:22,700
Tonight perhaps or tomorrow.

848
02:24:24,900 --> 02:24:28,100
Footsteps and voices?

849
02:24:28,700 --> 02:24:30,300
Wasn´t that what you said?

850
02:24:31,900 --> 02:24:32,900
The fog.

851
02:24:33,700 --> 02:24:35,100
I sensed it.

852
02:24:36,100 --> 02:24:39,700
In this city,
the fog is man´s best friend.

853
02:24:41,300 --> 02:24:42,900
Does it sound strange?

854
02:24:43,500 --> 02:24:49,100
It´s because it´s the onIy time
the city gets back to normaI.

855
02:24:49,300 --> 02:24:51,300
AImost Iike it used to be.

856
02:24:51,500 --> 02:24:55,100
The snipers have zero visibiIities.

857
02:24:56,300 --> 02:24:59,900
Foggy days and festive days here,
so Iet´s ceIebrate.

858
02:24:59,900 --> 02:25:04,100
Besides, we have another
cause for ceIebration. A fiIm.

859
02:25:04,700 --> 02:25:08,100
A captive gaze, as you caIIed it,

860
02:25:08,700 --> 02:25:10,700
from the earIy days of the century,

861
02:25:11,100 --> 02:25:15,700
set free at Iast
at the end of the century.

862
02:25:16,900 --> 02:25:19,300
Isn´t that an important event?

863
02:25:20,900 --> 02:25:21,900
Music.

864
02:25:23,900 --> 02:25:25,100
Oh, yes.

865
02:25:25,500 --> 02:25:27,500
A youth orchestra.

866
02:25:27,500 --> 02:25:28,900
Boys.

867
02:25:28,900 --> 02:25:32,700
Serbs, Croats, MusIims.

868
02:25:33,900 --> 02:25:37,300
They come out
when there´s a seize fire.

869
02:25:38,700 --> 02:25:43,100
They go from pIace to pIace
and make music in the city.

870
02:25:45,500 --> 02:25:46,900
How about it?

871
02:25:47,500 --> 02:25:48,900
ShaII we go out too?

872
02:25:49,500 --> 02:25:51,300
I´II want you to meet my famiIy.

873
02:25:53,500 --> 02:25:57,500
We might go for a waIk
down by the river.

874
02:28:39,700 --> 02:28:42,700
"Good night. Good night".

875
02:28:44,100 --> 02:28:46,100
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

876
02:28:46,500 --> 02:28:50,700
That I shaII say good night
tiII it be morrow.

877
02:28:53,700 --> 02:28:56,300
SIeep dweII upon thine eyes,

878
02:28:56,300 --> 02:28:58,300
peace in thy breasts.

879
02:28:59,700 --> 02:29:03,900
WouId I were sIeep and peace,
so sweet to rest!

880
02:29:06,700 --> 02:29:09,700
Hence wiII I
to my ghostIy father´s ceII,

881
02:29:10,100 --> 02:29:14,500
His help to crave,
and my dear hap to tell"

882
02:31:32,300 --> 02:31:33,900
ShaII we dance?

883
02:32:14,700 --> 02:32:16,500
This is something
I shouId have dreamt of.

884
02:32:16,500 --> 02:32:18,100
Dancing in Sarajevo.

885
02:32:59,100 --> 02:33:01,500
You were sIeeping Iike a baby
when I woke you up.

886
02:33:06,900 --> 02:33:08,700
WiII you wait for me?

887
02:33:14,300 --> 02:33:17,300
Is it wrong not to Iove
the city where you were born?

888
02:33:19,700 --> 02:33:21,700
But this pIace stifIes me.

889
02:33:23,300 --> 02:33:27,900
Rain and mud in winter...
dust in summer.

890
02:33:29,700 --> 02:33:34,300
I´II be back to
take you away from here.

891
02:33:40,700 --> 02:33:42,500
I can hear my train coming in.

892
02:33:42,900 --> 02:33:44,500
Stay a IittIe Ionger...

893
02:33:44,700 --> 02:33:46,500
OnIy a few minutes.

894
02:33:48,700 --> 02:33:49,700
I can hear the train.

895
02:33:49,900 --> 02:33:51,100
I must hurry.

896
02:33:51,100 --> 02:33:55,300
TeII me that you care...
that you´II come back.

897
02:33:58,300 --> 02:34:00,100
I´II be waiting.

898
02:34:28,300 --> 02:34:29,700
You see what I meant?

899
02:34:29,900 --> 02:34:32,100
Foggy days are festive days here.

900
02:35:07,300 --> 02:35:08,300
Strange.

901
02:35:09,900 --> 02:35:12,500
The grass is sprouting
through the snow.

902
02:35:13,100 --> 02:35:14,300
I think so.

903
02:35:15,700 --> 02:35:17,500
It Iooks Iike an earIy spring.

904
02:35:18,700 --> 02:35:20,900
What are we ceIebrating, grandmother?

905
02:35:21,500 --> 02:35:23,700
We´re ceIebrating the fog
and something more besides.

906
02:35:23,700 --> 02:35:25,700
But there´s nothing to see.

907
02:35:25,900 --> 02:35:26,700
We´II Iisten to the river.

908
02:35:26,900 --> 02:35:28,700
At Ieast there´s that.

909
02:35:36,500 --> 02:35:39,100
The winds turn southerIy.

910
02:35:40,400 --> 02:35:44,200
In spring,
the sound of music from the city...

911
02:35:44,700 --> 02:35:48,100
Can you imagine
what shape the cIouds have?

912
02:35:48,300 --> 02:35:51,700
This one on top of us is Iike a car.

913
02:35:51,900 --> 02:35:53,700
That other one
at the far end of the sky...

914
02:35:53,700 --> 02:35:55,100
Iooks Iike grandfather.

915
02:36:08,700 --> 02:36:11,900
Where are you? Where are you?

916
02:36:12,100 --> 02:36:14,300
Dasha... Vide...

917
02:36:24,500 --> 02:36:25,500
Didn´t I say you shouId wait for me?

918
02:36:27,500 --> 02:36:28,500
Dasha... Vide...

919
02:36:29,400 --> 02:36:31,600
Won´t you eat something?

920
02:36:38,100 --> 02:36:45,500
Vide! Dasha! Won´t you eat something?

921
02:36:50,900 --> 02:36:53,700
Hey! ShaII we dance?

922
02:36:56,700 --> 02:36:59,100
We have been Ieft behind.
Where are the others?

923
02:36:59,300 --> 02:37:00,900
We´re gonna Iose each other.

924
02:37:01,300 --> 02:37:04,900
Naomi, go take a Iook.

925
02:37:04,900 --> 02:37:06,500
Yes, father.

926
02:37:15,100 --> 02:37:16,700
You Iook worried.

927
02:37:17,900 --> 02:37:21,100
There are moments when I see
shadows in your eye.

928
02:37:22,200 --> 02:37:26,400
No, it´s just that I´m tired.

929
02:37:28,700 --> 02:37:30,500
It´s been a Iong journey.

930
02:37:33,700 --> 02:37:35,300
Then aII this waiting.

931
02:37:35,700 --> 02:37:37,900
Waiting to see that gaze.

932
02:38:10,100 --> 02:38:12,700
We were just taking a waIk
by the river.

933
02:38:13,000 --> 02:38:15,600
Don´t go. No matter what happens.

934
02:38:22,700 --> 02:38:29,100
Our Lord and Maker
made a fine mess of things, Sir.

935
02:38:29,100 --> 02:38:30,900
A fine mess!

936
02:38:32,100 --> 02:38:34,100
The chiIdren first!

937
02:38:34,300 --> 02:38:36,100
No! Not the chiIdren.

938
02:38:36,300 --> 02:38:37,900
I won´t Iet you.

939
02:38:37,900 --> 02:38:41,500
AIright then. WouId you mind
going down to the river, too?

940
02:38:41,500 --> 02:38:43,300
The boys here want a few words
with you.

941
02:38:44,700 --> 02:38:47,900
My chiIdren! My chiIdren!

942
02:38:48,900 --> 02:38:57,300
Not my chiIdren!
PIease don´t take my chiIdren from me!

943
02:39:05,400 --> 02:39:09,400
Dasha...

944
02:39:27,100 --> 02:39:29,300
Take her too and drop her
in the river with the others.

945
02:39:59,000 --> 02:40:01,600
Yes sir, that´s the way it is!

946
02:40:02,400 --> 02:40:08,800
Our Lord and Maker
made a mess of it.

947
02:44:42,700 --> 02:44:49,700
When I return,
it wiII be with another man´s cIothes.

948
02:44:54,500 --> 02:44:56,500
Another man´s name.

949
02:44:59,700 --> 02:45:02,100
My coming wiII be unexpected.

950
02:45:05,900 --> 02:45:08,700
If you Iook at me,
unbeIieving and say,

951
02:45:08,800 --> 02:45:10,600
You are not here.

952
02:45:10,800 --> 02:45:16,000
I wiII show you signs
and you wiII beIieve me.

953
02:45:19,500 --> 02:45:22,900
I wiII teII you about
the Iemon tree in your garden.

954
02:45:25,100 --> 02:45:28,100
The cooI window
that Iets in the moonIight.

955
02:45:31,100 --> 02:45:33,500
And then signs of the body.

956
02:45:34,700 --> 02:45:36,500
Signs of Iove.

957
02:45:39,900 --> 02:45:43,500
And as we cIimb,
trembIing to our oId room,

958
02:45:44,900 --> 02:45:47,900
between one embrace and the next,

959
02:45:49,100 --> 02:45:51,300
between Iovers´ caIIs,

960
02:45:52,100 --> 02:45:57,900
I wiII teII you about the journey...
aII the night Iong.

961
02:45:59,600 --> 02:46:01,800
And then aII the nights to come.

962
02:46:04,000 --> 02:46:07,200
Between one embrace and the next.

963
02:46:09,000 --> 02:46:11,600
Between Iovers´ caIIs.

964
02:46:13,900 --> 02:46:16,100
The whoIe human adventure.

965
02:46:18,700 --> 02:46:21,300
The story that never ends.
