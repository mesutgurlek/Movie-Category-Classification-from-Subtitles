1
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,779
Hi, Harry.

2
00:01:08,084 --> 00:01:10,245
It'll only be a few moments, sir.

3
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:14,422
Put that hand luggage in the automobile.

4
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:17,085
- Paul?
- Yeah.

5
00:01:17,193 --> 00:01:18,592
Put the footlockers in the jeep.

6
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,652
Everything else goes in the two-and-a-half.

7
00:01:20,730 --> 00:01:22,129
Unloading shouldn't take long.

8
00:01:22,198 --> 00:01:24,223
You won't be more than
a few minutes behind us.

9
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:26,291
I'll see you back at the hotel.

10
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:30,669
Harry, is everything set at the hotel?

11
00:01:35,378 --> 00:01:36,640
Hiya, Charlie.

12
00:02:21,591 --> 00:02:24,583
Adm. Jessup's riding
in the second car, sir.

13
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:31,699
Adm. Jessup, you remember Mr. Parks.

14
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:40,634
- Bus, I'll check on the unloading...
- See you inside.

15
00:02:41,945 --> 00:02:44,243
Glad you're back, Charlie.

16
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:47,007
We'll go around to the rear entrance.

17
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:13,709
Will you put this stuff in my room, Paul?

18
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:16,437
Hello, Tom.

19
00:03:16,512 --> 00:03:19,310
- Nice to have you back in London, sir.
- Thank you.

20
00:03:19,382 --> 00:03:22,545
There's a crate of eggs,
four pounds of bacon, four tins of coffee...

21
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,020
marmalade, six pounds of butter,
and ten pounds of oranges.

22
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:28,557
- Would you check those for bruises, Tom?
- I will, sir.

23
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,889
The Admiral will have breakfast
tomorrow at 7:30...

24
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,689
with Capt. Ellender and Cmdr. Cummings.

25
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:35,822
- Here's how everyone likes their eggs.
- Thank you, sir.

26
00:03:36,699 --> 00:03:37,757
I'll sign this in.

27
00:03:37,834 --> 00:03:40,530
- You pick up the wash and dry cleaning.
- Right.

28
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,300
Get some sleep.

29
00:04:00,723 --> 00:04:02,850
You can't win them all, Commander.

30
00:04:46,069 --> 00:04:48,902
Charlie, the Admiral wants to have
a little spread tonight.

31
00:04:48,972 --> 00:04:51,497
Then bridge later with
Generals Hallerton and Waterson.

32
00:04:51,574 --> 00:04:53,201
General Waterson doesn't play bridge.

33
00:04:53,276 --> 00:04:54,800
Yeah, but he'll want a partner anyway.

34
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,778
Try to dig up a couple of someones
to complete the foursome.

35
00:04:57,981 --> 00:04:59,505
Here's the menu.

36
00:04:59,582 --> 00:05:03,746
Steak, avocado salad, ice cream,
appropriate wine.

37
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:06,585
Call the motor pool and get a driver,
will you?

38
00:05:06,656 --> 00:05:09,056
We're going to stay in London
at least for a while.

39
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:11,889
- Until the balloon goes up.
- What balloon?

40
00:05:11,961 --> 00:05:14,361
D-day. The invasion of Europe.

41
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:17,297
- You might as well set up house.
- Okay.

42
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,959
Motor pool, please.

43
00:05:19,035 --> 00:05:21,697
Gen. Waterson likes redheaded partners?

44
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:23,466
Yes, as I recall.

45
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:26,599
Paul, never mind.
I'll go by the motor pool myself.

46
00:05:26,676 --> 00:05:29,304
Avocado salad. That's a new one.

47
00:05:40,456 --> 00:05:41,684
Hi, Charlie.

48
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:44,591
Sheila, could you be a redhead
by 5:30 this afternoon?

49
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,786
I could manage it, love.

50
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:48,387
- Am I to drive, or am I to dress?
- You'll have to dress.

51
00:05:48,464 --> 00:05:50,261
It's for dinner and a bit of mauling.

52
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,460
A two-star general who usually passes out
at 11:30.

53
00:05:52,535 --> 00:05:54,025
Two-star general.

54
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:57,504
Push on to SHAEF, Pat.
Two Navy captains. Wait in front, will you?

55
00:05:57,573 --> 00:05:59,370
- Here you are, Charlie.
- Bye, Pat.

56
00:05:59,442 --> 00:06:01,967
I need a driver to take me to Hendon.
How about Sheila?

57
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:04,240
I'm sorry, love. I'm afraid she's on call.

58
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:07,407
Emily, take Cmdr. Madison
over to Hendon airport.

59
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:10,418
If I'm to be a redhead,
I'll need a new dress, don't you agree?

60
00:06:10,486 --> 00:06:11,783
I'll be in my room by lunch.

61
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:12,946
You are a love, Charlie.

62
00:06:13,022 --> 00:06:14,751
Here's your ticket. This is yours, love.

63
00:06:14,824 --> 00:06:16,792
Rear Admiral. Go to Hammersmith.

64
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:18,224
Rear Admiral?

65
00:06:19,328 --> 00:06:22,195
I shall be up in my new dress
during lunch, love.

66
00:06:32,775 --> 00:06:35,403
Is Lt. Hayworth still
Navy Supply Officer here?

67
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,345
No, sir. There's a Lt. Wade there now, sir.

68
00:06:41,284 --> 00:06:42,717
Thank you, sir.

69
00:06:42,785 --> 00:06:45,686
It might help you to know
that Lt. Wade is from Alabama.

70
00:06:45,755 --> 00:06:46,847
Thank you.

71
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:56,321
Drop around my hotel tomorrow at 3:00.
I got some bottles for you, anyway.

72
00:06:56,466 --> 00:06:58,024
What kind of bottles?

73
00:06:58,101 --> 00:07:02,765
What kind of bottles would I have for
a Confederate kinsman in an alien land?

74
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:05,637
- Don't tell me.
- I.W. Harper.

75
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,438
You can't get bourbon over here.

76
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,103
You got three bottles.

77
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:14,440
You're quite a dog-robber,
ain't you, Madison?

78
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,949
Let's just make sure
we read each other clear, Wade.

79
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:19,612
I'll take care of you...

80
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,250
but, Lieutenant,
my admiral sets the best table...

81
00:07:23,326 --> 00:07:25,760
of anybody in
the European theater of operations...

82
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:27,796
including the Supreme Commander.

83
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,492
I want the prime of everything
you've got in here.

84
00:07:30,566 --> 00:07:34,627
When I ask for steak, I mean aged,
two inches thick...

85
00:07:35,471 --> 00:07:38,565
corn-fed, that you can cut
with a sharp look.

86
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:40,866
I'm setting up house, now.

87
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:44,003
For today, I want six dozen sirloin strips...

88
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,708
one crate of oranges,
one crate of grapefruit...

89
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:50,616
six rib roasts, three Swiss hams,
six gallons of ice cream...

90
00:07:50,753 --> 00:07:52,846
and one gallon chocolate syrup.

91
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,158
I expect to be favored.

92
00:07:57,627 --> 00:07:59,788
If any other admiral's dog-robber
complains...

93
00:07:59,862 --> 00:08:01,727
tell him my admiral will cover for you...

94
00:08:01,797 --> 00:08:03,662
all the way to the Secretary of the Navy.

95
00:08:03,733 --> 00:08:06,201
If you do right, I'll see that you get...

96
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:09,069
the Legion of Merit with clusters.

97
00:08:09,205 --> 00:08:11,571
That's for your gallant service.

98
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:18,078
If you fink on my admiral, man...

99
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,884
The last supply officer,
who sent my admiral a chewy steak...

100
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:29,589
is now at the North Pole
doing polar research.

101
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:34,853
You read me, Lieutenant?

102
00:08:34,931 --> 00:08:36,796
I read you, Commander.

103
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:39,561
If you'll just have
that sweet young thing...

104
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:43,162
drive that Buick around to the dock
while we load you up.

105
00:09:05,394 --> 00:09:08,659
You Americans are really enjoying
this war, aren't you?

106
00:09:08,731 --> 00:09:09,720
Ma'am?

107
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:13,858
Most English families haven't seen
that many oranges or eggs in years.

108
00:09:13,936 --> 00:09:17,531
But it's one big Shriners' Convention
to you Yanks, isn't it?

109
00:09:17,607 --> 00:09:18,904
Well, that's swell, miss.

110
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:22,411
- Barham.
- On to the hotel, Miss Barham.

111
00:09:22,578 --> 00:09:24,045
It's nearly lunch.

112
00:09:25,114 --> 00:09:28,208
Since when did you start asking
for ration coupons, Alfie?

113
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:29,273
Bienvenue.

114
00:09:29,752 --> 00:09:31,151
That's the avocados.

115
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,654
It's too bloody gorgeous, Charlie.

116
00:09:33,723 --> 00:09:35,588
I need a girl, Sheila.

117
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:39,617
A bright, bridge-playing girl.
Very crusty, elegant...

118
00:09:39,695 --> 00:09:43,791
British diction calculated
to bring out the upstart in the American.

119
00:09:43,866 --> 00:09:47,700
Who can handle herself at a dinner table
and play bridge like an assassin.

120
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:49,670
Whatever happened to Alice Luddens?

121
00:09:49,739 --> 00:09:53,231
She's married off, love,
to a lieutenant in the paratroops.

122
00:09:53,309 --> 00:09:56,836
Can't be too choosy, I suppose,
if you're a widow with two kids.

123
00:09:56,912 --> 00:09:58,937
Can I go and try it on, Charlie?

124
00:10:07,256 --> 00:10:10,657
The balloon is going up any day now.

125
00:10:10,726 --> 00:10:13,593
- What balloon?
- D-day, old man.

126
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,930
Invasion of Europe.

127
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,195
Any day now 1,000,000 men
are gonna hit the beaches of France...

128
00:10:19,268 --> 00:10:21,293
in the greatest battle in history.

129
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,838
Do you know any girls
who play a good game of bridge?

130
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:25,533
What do you think, Charlie?

131
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:28,133
Yeah. It's worth a try.

132
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:32,678
- Harry, let me borrow this for a while.
- Hey.

133
00:10:32,748 --> 00:10:34,375
It's a matter of State.

134
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:45,154
- Charlie, what happened to you?
- Knock off.

135
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:51,363
An old wound, Commander?

136
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:55,068
Yes. A bit of flak I picked up
flying for the RAF in 1940.

137
00:10:55,137 --> 00:10:56,729
Acts up every now and then.

138
00:10:56,806 --> 00:10:57,898
Pity.

139
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,570
Miss Barham, do you play bridge?

140
00:11:02,111 --> 00:11:03,703
Yes, I do. Why?

141
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,940
Adm. Jessup would like you
to be his guest...

142
00:11:06,015 --> 00:11:07,573
for dinner and bridge this evening.

143
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,810
I see.

144
00:11:08,884 --> 00:11:11,717
Just dinner and bridge. Nothing else.

145
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:14,847
I'll have you delivered
back to your quarters by 10:30.

146
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:16,186
No, thank you.

147
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:19,958
If you don't need me, Commander,
may I take my lunch?

148
00:11:29,171 --> 00:11:31,935
You're something of a prig, Miss Barham.

149
00:11:35,311 --> 00:11:37,006
I don't mean to be.

150
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:00,090
Sheila? Do you think I'm a prig?

151
00:12:00,236 --> 00:12:02,101
Lord, yes, love.

152
00:12:02,171 --> 00:12:04,162
You've been shattering us
with your virtue...

153
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,935
ever since you joined this motor pool.

154
00:12:06,008 --> 00:12:09,034
- I've been that awful?
- Bloody virgin goddess herself.

155
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:13,281
The fact is, I'm anything but.

156
00:12:13,349 --> 00:12:17,285
I'm grotesquely sentimental.
I fall in love at the drop of a hat.

157
00:12:17,353 --> 00:12:19,719
That's why I gave up hospital driving.

158
00:12:20,556 --> 00:12:22,183
All those men...

159
00:12:22,258 --> 00:12:24,818
moaning in the back of the ambulance.

160
00:12:25,261 --> 00:12:27,559
Especially the lot from Africa.

161
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:30,825
I used to read to them in my off-hours.

162
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,630
When they were healed,
and being sent back to the Front...

163
00:12:33,702 --> 00:12:37,661
they'd come looking for me to spend
their last nights of leave with them.

164
00:12:37,907 --> 00:12:39,534
Little hotel rooms.

165
00:12:39,942 --> 00:12:42,206
Bed and breakfast for a guinea.

166
00:12:42,945 --> 00:12:45,846
I paid the guinea myself,
more often than not.

167
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,108
But I couldn't say no to them, could I?

168
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:53,147
I'd just lost my husband at Tobruk.

169
00:12:53,255 --> 00:12:56,713
And I was overwhelmed with tenderness
for all dying men.

170
00:13:03,065 --> 00:13:05,693
As I say, I'm grotesquely sentimental.

171
00:13:09,672 --> 00:13:13,130
- What on earth are you doing to your hair?
- I'm turning it red.

172
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,837
I'm going
to one of Charlie Madison's dos tonight.

173
00:13:15,911 --> 00:13:18,345
Yes. I was asked to that one.

174
00:13:19,648 --> 00:13:21,582
Does it require red hair?

175
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:25,619
Do come, love.
Charlie lays on smashing food.

176
00:13:25,688 --> 00:13:28,748
All sorts of meats, fruit, real cream.

177
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:31,156
Things we haven't seen
in England for years.

178
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,788
You'll get a new dress out of it.
Have you been to Madison's room?

179
00:13:34,864 --> 00:13:37,389
- Nope.
- You've just got to see it.

180
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:39,092
It's the swankiest shop in town.

181
00:13:39,168 --> 00:13:42,001
He's got everything up there
but the crown jewels.

182
00:13:48,777 --> 00:13:50,506
Here, look at this.

183
00:13:51,714 --> 00:13:53,443
You can't see this at Harrods.

184
00:13:53,516 --> 00:13:56,576
That's nylon, love. And this is pure silk.

185
00:13:56,952 --> 00:14:00,183
I'd show you my new dress,
but I don't want the others to see.

186
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:03,020
It's Bonwit Tellers.
You've heard of that, I imagine.

187
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:05,560
You mean he actually supplies you
with a wardrobe?

188
00:14:05,628 --> 00:14:07,528
Charlie dresses you proper.

189
00:14:07,596 --> 00:14:10,861
Americans don't like to see their women
in uniforms.

190
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:13,665
But it all ends in someone's bed,
doesn't it?

191
00:14:13,736 --> 00:14:15,704
I mean, that's the point, isn't it?

192
00:14:15,771 --> 00:14:20,208
Look who's talking after
that lurid confession you've just made.

193
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:23,870
Sorry. I am a prig, at that.

194
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,980
I feel rather tender towards
the poor beggars myself.

195
00:14:28,050 --> 00:14:30,985
I don't want to feel tender
towards anyone.

196
00:14:31,186 --> 00:14:33,120
Especially soldiers.

197
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,585
I've lost a husband, a father,
and a brother in this war.

198
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:41,696
When my husband died,
I almost went insane.

199
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,664
I take these things badly.

200
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:50,469
I fall in love too easily,
and I shatter too easily.

201
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:54,934
I don't want any more doomed men.

202
00:14:55,511 --> 00:14:58,207
Do come tonight, love.

203
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,906
These men aren't doomed.

204
00:14:59,982 --> 00:15:02,507
They'll never see any of the shooting,
that's for sure.

205
00:15:02,585 --> 00:15:04,246
We'll have a few laughs.

206
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:08,288
I've never seen anyone needing
a few laughs as much as you do.

207
00:15:17,466 --> 00:15:20,264
- Very nice crystal, Tom. Danish?
- Yes, sir.

208
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:24,472
I don't much care for the centerpiece.
You can take that out.

209
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,871
Of course.

210
00:15:27,209 --> 00:15:29,939
- Italian. Very lovely.
- Thank you, sir.

211
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:35,650
Cocktails at 5:30, and heavy on the gin.

212
00:15:35,718 --> 00:15:38,084
Dinner at 6:00 promptly.
Once you've cleared away...

213
00:15:38,153 --> 00:15:39,950
- I'll manage from there.
- Very good, sir.

214
00:15:40,022 --> 00:15:41,956
You're not limping, Commander.

215
00:15:44,126 --> 00:15:46,151
It's the <i>Arabian Nights.</i>

216
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:48,621
Do you have chests of rubies
in the bathroom?

217
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,062
Just perfumes and liquor.

218
00:15:50,132 --> 00:15:51,929
I've heard about this room, Commander.

219
00:15:52,001 --> 00:15:55,095
All the girls talk about it,
but I just couldn't believe it.

220
00:15:55,170 --> 00:15:58,139
Bergdorf Goodman, Saks Fifth Avenue,
Lord & Taylor.

221
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,370
Sheila's right.
It is the swankiest shop in town.

222
00:16:02,878 --> 00:16:05,108
Good heavens! Arpege perfume.

223
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:08,377
How did you manage Arpege
with the Germans in Paris?

224
00:16:08,584 --> 00:16:10,677
There are Germans in Paris, aren't there?

225
00:16:10,753 --> 00:16:12,277
There is a war on, I think.

226
00:16:12,354 --> 00:16:14,948
You Americans must have heard
something about it, I'm sure.

227
00:16:15,024 --> 00:16:18,118
Just pick out a dress, honey,
and be back at 5:30.

228
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:21,328
You American-haters bore me to tears,
Miss Barham.

229
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:23,991
I've dealt with Europeans all my life.

230
00:16:24,266 --> 00:16:26,427
I know all about us parvenus
from the States...

231
00:16:26,502 --> 00:16:29,335
who come over here and race around
your old cathedral towns...

232
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,168
with our cameras and Coca-Cola bottles.

233
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:35,006
Brawl in your pubs, paw your women,
and act like we own the world.

234
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:36,874
We over tip. We talk too loud.

235
00:16:36,945 --> 00:16:39,436
We think we can buy anything
with a Hershey bar.

236
00:16:39,515 --> 00:16:41,449
I've had Germans and Italians tell me...

237
00:16:41,517 --> 00:16:43,109
how politically ingenuous we are.

238
00:16:43,185 --> 00:16:44,277
And perhaps so.

239
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:46,719
But we haven't managed a Hitler
or Mussolini yet.

240
00:16:46,789 --> 00:16:48,620
I've had Frenchmen call me a savage...

241
00:16:48,691 --> 00:16:50,659
because I only took half an hour for lunch.

242
00:16:50,726 --> 00:16:53,217
The only reason the French
take two hours for lunch...

243
00:16:53,295 --> 00:16:55,820
is because the service
in their restaurants is lousy.

244
00:16:55,898 --> 00:16:58,298
The most tedious lot are you British.

245
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:01,831
We crass Americans didn't introduce war
into your little island.

246
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:05,135
This war, Miss Barham, to which
we Americans are so insensitive...

247
00:17:05,207 --> 00:17:07,675
is the result of 2,000 years
of European greed...

248
00:17:07,743 --> 00:17:09,734
barbarism, superstition, and stupidity.

249
00:17:09,812 --> 00:17:11,609
Don't blame it on our Coca-Cola bottles.

250
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:15,047
Europe was a going brothel
long before we came to town.

251
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,210
Dear me. What an outburst.

252
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,947
So lay off, Mrs. Miniver.

253
00:17:19,021 --> 00:17:21,216
If you don't like Hershey bars,
don't take them.

254
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:22,757
Pick yourself a frock, or get out.

255
00:17:22,825 --> 00:17:25,419
It's not my job to listen
to your sentimental contempt.

256
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:28,054
I could almost believe
you flew for the RAF.

257
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,291
I never flew for the RAF, and you know it.

258
00:17:30,365 --> 00:17:33,095
You didn't expect me
to believe you for a minute, did you?

259
00:17:33,168 --> 00:17:34,430
Not for a minute.

260
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:36,300
But why, Commander?

261
00:17:37,005 --> 00:17:39,132
You're here, Miss Barham.

262
00:17:39,508 --> 00:17:40,975
Yes, so I am.

263
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,835
You're a complete rascal.

264
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:47,475
I'll be back at 5:30.

265
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:49,483
The Admiral will be delighted
you're coming.

266
00:17:49,551 --> 00:17:51,917
- Looking forward to it.
- Lf I can be of any service.

267
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:55,889
I have my own clothes, Commander.
I'll do without your Hershey bars.

268
00:17:59,428 --> 00:18:01,623
Do you have a girl, Commander?

269
00:18:01,697 --> 00:18:04,427
None of your damn business,
Miss Barham.

270
00:18:13,642 --> 00:18:16,634
Avocado!
I haven't seen avocados in years!

271
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,840
- Come over to the table...
- But they're out of season, darling.

272
00:18:20,916 --> 00:18:22,941
But, the Admiral likes
to have some around...

273
00:18:23,018 --> 00:18:24,645
just to keep his guests happy.

274
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,484
- Isn't that right, Charlie?
- Right, Bus.

275
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:42,567
These Hungarians at the Princess,
they really are...

276
00:18:42,638 --> 00:18:44,629
- Good evening.
- Excuse me.

277
00:18:46,074 --> 00:18:50,511
Miss Barham, you must know someone
at Saks Fifth Avenue yourself.

278
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:53,843
What? This old thing.

279
00:18:54,349 --> 00:18:55,816
It's lovely.

280
00:19:00,155 --> 00:19:03,090
Miss Barham, if you need any assistance
you just give a yell.

281
00:19:03,158 --> 00:19:05,149
I'll be somewhere near at hand.

282
00:19:07,095 --> 00:19:09,222
Charlie, this is Madame Clarabigh.

283
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:10,993
- How do you do?
- You know the General.

284
00:19:11,066 --> 00:19:13,159
- Yes, General.
- Madame...

285
00:19:13,268 --> 00:19:15,498
You'll have to excuse us, Admiral.

286
00:19:15,637 --> 00:19:18,800
I hope you'll excuse me
for taking you away from the Admiral...

287
00:19:18,874 --> 00:19:21,570
but a gentleman expressed
his desire to meet you.

288
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:24,240
You do speak Russian?

289
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:32,186
- Tom.
- Sir?

290
00:19:32,321 --> 00:19:34,619
I want you to keep the food moving.

291
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:38,285
The Admiral wants the room cleared
in two hours for that bridge game.

292
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:39,894
- Doubled.
- Redoubled.

293
00:19:39,995 --> 00:19:41,986
- Pass.
- Pass.

294
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:00,047
I overbid?

295
00:20:00,148 --> 00:20:03,174
Let's just say you have unbridled courage.

296
00:20:07,656 --> 00:20:11,615
I don't like the way the Navy's publicity
is being handled in Overlord.

297
00:20:11,727 --> 00:20:16,096
I want extreme measures taken to
publicize the Navy's role in this invasion.

298
00:20:16,231 --> 00:20:18,096
The President supports me in this.

299
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,896
Yeah, we received your cables, Jesse...

300
00:20:21,003 --> 00:20:23,471
but I don't know what you mean
by extreme measures.

301
00:20:23,538 --> 00:20:25,028
This is going to be a bloodbath.

302
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:27,632
I want a Marine division
to be the first assault wave.

303
00:20:27,709 --> 00:20:29,802
You're not going to drag
that old chestnut in.

304
00:20:29,878 --> 00:20:32,346
The Marines are traditional shock troops,
you know it.

305
00:20:32,414 --> 00:20:35,747
Not in the European theater
of operations, they're not.

306
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:39,880
You Navy guys get all the headlines
in the South Pacific.

307
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,385
But Europe's an Army show.

308
00:20:42,758 --> 00:20:45,022
It's been understood
from the beginning, Jesse.

309
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:47,118
I've written the Supreme Commander
about this.

310
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:49,060
That's one of the reasons he's out of town.

311
00:20:49,131 --> 00:20:51,292
You must be off your rocker, Jesse,
if you think...

312
00:20:51,366 --> 00:20:54,096
assault changes can be made
at this stage of preparation.

313
00:20:54,569 --> 00:20:56,332
You know when the balloon's going up.

314
00:20:56,405 --> 00:20:57,804
What balloon?

315
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:59,539
I've been instructed to say...

316
00:20:59,608 --> 00:21:02,236
that we're going to put on a few more
Navy staff officers...

317
00:21:02,311 --> 00:21:03,778
at supreme headquarters.

318
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:07,504
We're going to push the PRO people
to send out more Navy releases.

319
00:21:07,582 --> 00:21:10,073
The Supreme Commander
wants it clear that he considers...

320
00:21:10,152 --> 00:21:13,178
this inter-service competitiveness
in very bad taste.

321
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:16,918
He's having enough trouble
keeping the English and French in line.

322
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:18,583
You're down four, Willie.

323
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:20,821
Doubled, redoubled, and vulnerable.

324
00:21:22,164 --> 00:21:26,464
Marine division!
You must be losing your mind, Jesse.

325
00:21:27,169 --> 00:21:30,434
- Who deals?
- The young lady, I think.

326
00:21:32,607 --> 00:21:34,336
Clear away that table, please.

327
00:21:34,409 --> 00:21:36,377
General Waterson? Your car is ready, sir.

328
00:21:36,445 --> 00:21:38,879
- Thank you.
- Good night, Sheila.

329
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,317
- Champagne, Charlie.
- It's being chilled.

330
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,290
It'll be outside your door in half an hour.

331
00:21:50,425 --> 00:21:51,483
Where...

332
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,050
I sent her in.

333
00:21:56,698 --> 00:21:59,462
Your car's here, General.

334
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:01,399
It's $34, all right.

335
00:22:01,470 --> 00:22:04,098
At Adm. Jessup's request,
I've had The Scotch House...

336
00:22:04,172 --> 00:22:05,730
send you three yards of tweed, sir.

337
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:07,138
It's for Mrs. Hallerton.

338
00:22:07,209 --> 00:22:09,803
It won't get him
his Marine division, Charlie...

339
00:22:09,878 --> 00:22:11,869
but it's generous of him.
Thank him for me.

340
00:22:11,947 --> 00:22:13,642
It was good to see you again, sir.

341
00:22:13,715 --> 00:22:15,683
- Good night.
- Good night.

342
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:21,451
Miss Barham,
there's a car downstairs for you...

343
00:22:21,523 --> 00:22:25,186
- if you'd like me to take you down...
- No, thank you. I'll manage.

344
00:22:28,063 --> 00:22:31,555
I had a lovely evening, Commander.
Please ask me again.

345
00:22:37,572 --> 00:22:40,405
Was I rude, Charlie,
in leaving all those good-byes to you?

346
00:22:40,475 --> 00:22:42,340
It wasn't noticed, sir.

347
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:45,310
I've got the damnedest headache.

348
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:48,247
I'll fix you a drink
before your bath, Admiral.

349
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,550
Charlie, in seven weeks,
I've got to go back to Washington...

350
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:57,217
and testify before the Joint Committee
on Military Affairs.

351
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:02,025
On the agenda is a review of the Army's
new long-range bomber program.

352
00:23:02,264 --> 00:23:04,994
And there'll be speculation...

353
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:09,026
as to whether that doesn't make
carrier-based aircraft obsolete.

354
00:23:09,404 --> 00:23:12,703
In short, they're out
to scrap the Navy again.

355
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:19,537
Charlie, the Air Corps is coming out of
this war the darling of the services.

356
00:23:19,614 --> 00:23:22,048
The Army and its Air Corps.

357
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:24,878
The Navy will be the runt of the litter.

358
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,281
They'll scrap us...

359
00:23:27,756 --> 00:23:30,384
like they do after every war.

360
00:23:30,692 --> 00:23:32,717
Limit our capital ships...

361
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:40,835
reduce our crews to cadres,
strip us back to Pearl Harbor level.

362
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,836
Then they'll scream
how ill-prepared we are...

363
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:46,806
when somebody hits us
with another Pearl Harbor.

364
00:23:47,142 --> 00:23:51,169
All Washington is bug-eyed
over this invasion of Europe.

365
00:23:51,379 --> 00:23:54,371
And this invasion of Europe
is an all Army show.

366
00:23:56,685 --> 00:23:58,653
That's why we're here, Charlie.

367
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,915
To remind the Congress
of the United States...

368
00:24:00,989 --> 00:24:02,650
and the American public...

369
00:24:02,724 --> 00:24:05,693
that this invasion of Europe
is also a Navy show.

370
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,594
I just threw in that Marine division
for openers.

371
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:17,532
They turned me down.
Now they owe me something.

372
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:19,497
But what?

373
00:24:19,574 --> 00:24:21,041
What?

374
00:24:22,277 --> 00:24:24,541
I don't know what to shoot for.

375
00:24:24,746 --> 00:24:27,214
I've got to come up with something.

376
00:24:28,316 --> 00:24:30,284
It's driving me crazy.

377
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:35,353
Charlie, fix me something for this head,
will you? It's killing me.

378
00:24:35,423 --> 00:24:37,015
Sure, Admiral.

379
00:24:47,302 --> 00:24:48,826
Sure, George, sure.

380
00:24:49,471 --> 00:24:51,803
Sure. Support that damn peanut.

381
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,730
Damn Chinese.

382
00:24:55,043 --> 00:24:58,501
Communist. Five years at the most.

383
00:25:00,982 --> 00:25:02,279
Here's your drink, sir.

384
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,545
Murderers, boy. Murderers.

385
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,022
You're on the nose there, George.

386
00:25:10,492 --> 00:25:12,119
Andrew, for one.

387
00:25:12,694 --> 00:25:14,719
Take the steam out of it.

388
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:18,725
And your damned Army in China, anyway.

389
00:25:27,842 --> 00:25:30,777
I'll leave your drink on the bed table, sir.

390
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:02,342
Come to think of it, I don't have a girl.

391
00:26:04,446 --> 00:26:06,175
I don't have a man.

392
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:13,986
You think we can keep it on that level?

393
00:26:15,156 --> 00:26:16,646
Not a chance.

394
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:21,219
It's going to be just one of those things,
you and I.

395
00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:23,926
I like your spirit, Commander.

396
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:55,561
- I'm not your type, you know.
- Like hell, you're not.

397
00:26:57,632 --> 00:27:02,126
I would have thought you'd fancy heroes.
I'm yellow, honey, clear through.

398
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,797
That's your most attractive quality.

399
00:27:08,410 --> 00:27:12,574
I've had it with heroes.
Every man I've loved has died in this war.

400
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:17,311
You'll never get caught in the shooting.
That's one thing I'm sure of.

401
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:21,012
You can't imagine how attractive
that makes you to me.

402
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,755
Easy, tiger. That's a tailored shirt.

403
00:27:27,829 --> 00:27:29,820
Shut up and let me kiss you.

404
00:27:34,336 --> 00:27:37,305
The first dead man on Omaha Beach
must be a sailor.

405
00:27:37,372 --> 00:27:38,930
You read me, sir?

406
00:27:39,007 --> 00:27:42,204
The first dead man on Omaha Beach
must be a sailor.

407
00:27:42,277 --> 00:27:44,040
Put your mind on that, sir.

408
00:27:46,848 --> 00:27:49,180
Dear me, what was that about?

409
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,013
What did he say?

410
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:55,879
I think he said, "The first dead man
on Omaha Beach must be a sailor."

411
00:27:56,391 --> 00:27:58,882
That's a very piquant thing to say,
don't you think?

412
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:01,986
Yes, I think I'd call it piquant.

413
00:28:02,063 --> 00:28:03,792
Does he do that often?

414
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:07,868
No. I don't think I ever remember him
doing that before.

415
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:12,031
Excuse me a minute, will you, please?

416
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:29,787
Hello, Charlie.

417
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:34,024
The first dead man on Omaha Beach
must be a sailor.

418
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:35,994
Think about that for a minute.

419
00:28:36,064 --> 00:28:38,032
In what reference, sir?

420
00:28:40,535 --> 00:28:42,435
The Unknown Sailor.

421
00:28:43,238 --> 00:28:45,866
Let me kick that around
in my own mind for a minute.

422
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:50,001
Charlie, I want the whole team
in my office tomorrow morning at 0900...

423
00:28:50,078 --> 00:28:51,739
to discuss just that.

424
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,610
To discuss just what, sir?

425
00:28:53,681 --> 00:28:57,082
Arrange that, Charlie.
0900. The whole team.

426
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,642
Good night, Charlie.

427
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,357
Good night, sir.

428
00:29:25,814 --> 00:29:27,577
- Who is it?
- Always barging in...

429
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:30,675
- Bus, the strangest thing happened.
- Close the door!

430
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,186
The Admiral came into my room
in his nightshirt...

431
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:36,382
yelling, "The first dead man
on Omaha Beach must be a sailor."

432
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:39,291
What's up? You can see
the obvious state of affairs here.

433
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,554
The Admiral's ripped a braid.

434
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:42,892
He came barging in, yelling,
"The first dead..."

435
00:29:42,964 --> 00:29:46,297
- For Pete's sake, tomorrow morning...
- Tomorrow morning at 0900...

436
00:29:46,367 --> 00:29:48,892
the Admiral wants the team
in his office to discuss...

437
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,336
"The first dead man on Omaha Beach
must be a sailor."

438
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:52,668
Yeah. Swell. Great.

439
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,072
Where are my ruddy shoes?

440
00:29:55,844 --> 00:29:56,936
Tomorrow morning, Charlie?

441
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:58,478
- Bloody rude Americans!
- All right.

442
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:00,946
- They're all the same!
- Tomorrow morning.

443
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:05,616
I think Charlie's flipped his screw.

444
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:08,622
This hotel's like a ruddy circus,
if you don't mind me saying.

445
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:09,987
I mean, really!

446
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:11,616
Now, it's okay, baby.

447
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,655
We've got about a month.

448
00:30:14,028 --> 00:30:19,022
I want a movie made that shows
the Navy's contribution to D-day.

449
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:23,094
From the procurement of vessels
to the actual landings.

450
00:30:23,605 --> 00:30:26,233
Gentlemen, 4,000 ships and boats...

451
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:29,873
battleships, destroyers,
landing crafts, spit kits...

452
00:30:29,944 --> 00:30:33,710
excursion steamers,
channel boats, private yachts...

453
00:30:33,781 --> 00:30:36,477
tugs, tubs and Chinese junks.

454
00:30:36,684 --> 00:30:38,777
4,000 vessels.

455
00:30:39,387 --> 00:30:41,685
The greatest armada
ever assembled by man...

456
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,451
is going to cross that channel.

457
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:45,686
They're going to have to do it at night...

458
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,058
across one of the nastiest waters
in the world...

459
00:30:48,129 --> 00:30:49,221
the English Channel.

460
00:30:49,297 --> 00:30:52,630
Every inch of that channel
is mined in the bargain.

461
00:30:54,836 --> 00:30:58,397
It'll be the most incredible
naval achievement in history.

462
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:02,702
If Hitler could have done it,
he'd have had the world in his pocket...

463
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:06,804
and it's the Navy that's the essence
of victory in this invasion.

464
00:31:07,682 --> 00:31:10,150
- I want a movie that makes that clear.
- Sir...

465
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:13,483
I especially want a movie
that shows the Navy demolition units...

466
00:31:13,555 --> 00:31:16,422
who are going to be
the first men on those beaches.

467
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:19,493
Casualties...

468
00:31:19,561 --> 00:31:23,190
are estimated at 50%
in the first assault waves.

469
00:31:23,865 --> 00:31:27,596
A lot of brave men are going to die
on D-day, gentlemen...

470
00:31:27,669 --> 00:31:29,159
and I want a movie that shows...

471
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:32,695
the first brave man to die
on those beaches was a sailor.

472
00:31:33,875 --> 00:31:36,207
If that's a Roger Charlton,
I'll be there directly.

473
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:37,266
Yes, sir.

474
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:41,276
Adm. Jessup's office.

475
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:44,749
Yes, sir. He'll be there directly.
Thank you, sir.

476
00:31:44,819 --> 00:31:46,377
Now, here's what I want done.

477
00:31:46,454 --> 00:31:49,981
I want a photography team assigned
to the demolition engineers...

478
00:31:50,058 --> 00:31:53,721
to record their activities on film
right up to the beaches.

479
00:31:54,596 --> 00:31:57,963
I'm leaving this in your hands, Bus.
I consider it urgent.

480
00:31:58,032 --> 00:32:01,297
There are six photography teams
assigned to the first assault wave.

481
00:32:01,369 --> 00:32:04,964
I don't care about other photography
teams. I want one of my own...

482
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,531
to record the heroism
of those Navy engineers.

483
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:10,510
I want this film made, Commander.

484
00:32:10,578 --> 00:32:13,069
You get some photographers' mates
and start making it.

485
00:32:13,147 --> 00:32:14,637
Aye, aye, sir.

486
00:32:16,884 --> 00:32:18,317
Any questions?

487
00:32:19,287 --> 00:32:20,720
No, sir.

488
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:30,563
How's that for a cockamamie assignment?

489
00:32:30,765 --> 00:32:34,496
He's been getting these eccentric flashes
ever since his wife died last year.

490
00:32:34,569 --> 00:32:37,436
Yeah. He's got something in the back
of his mind.

491
00:32:37,505 --> 00:32:40,065
I'll check and see
if I can't find photographer's mates.

492
00:32:40,141 --> 00:32:41,802
Where are you going?

493
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,137
Call in about noon, Charlie.

494
00:32:46,314 --> 00:32:48,248
I don't know what's the matter
with Charlie...

495
00:33:05,667 --> 00:33:07,100
Hello, Emily.

496
00:33:07,168 --> 00:33:10,365
Hello. You're just in time for tea.

497
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:12,537
Thank you.

498
00:33:16,177 --> 00:33:19,613
- You brought me some chocolates?
- Two boxes of Hershey's.

499
00:33:19,681 --> 00:33:22,616
That's very American of you, Charlie.

500
00:33:22,684 --> 00:33:25,710
You just had to bring along
some small token of opulence.

501
00:33:25,787 --> 00:33:27,277
I don't want them.

502
00:33:28,556 --> 00:33:31,616
You Yanks can't even show affection
without buying something.

503
00:33:31,693 --> 00:33:34,628
Don't get into a state over it.
I thought you liked chocolates.

504
00:33:34,696 --> 00:33:36,630
I do! But my country's at war...

505
00:33:36,698 --> 00:33:38,825
and we're doing without chocolates
for a while.

506
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:41,801
I don't want oranges or eggs
or soap flakes, either.

507
00:33:42,737 --> 00:33:46,537
Don't show me how profitable it'll be
to fall in love with you, Charlie.

508
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,336
Don't Americanize me.

509
00:33:53,214 --> 00:33:56,581
That's my father.
He lost a leg in the first war.

510
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:59,451
Got the Victoria Cross for that.

511
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:03,788
He died in an air raid a week after
that portrait was painted.

512
00:34:04,492 --> 00:34:06,153
That's my brother, there.

513
00:34:06,227 --> 00:34:08,491
His name was Charlie, too, by the way.

514
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:10,997
He was shot down during the blitz.

515
00:34:11,532 --> 00:34:14,262
Sacrificed himself to save his squadron.

516
00:34:16,104 --> 00:34:18,664
The one you're looking at now
is my husband.

517
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:20,903
He looks like a rake.

518
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:23,609
Yes. He was very bawdy.

519
00:34:23,678 --> 00:34:25,942
I was insane about him.

520
00:34:26,514 --> 00:34:28,209
He died at Tobruk.

521
00:34:29,517 --> 00:34:32,179
The rest of the lot there are cousins.

522
00:34:32,253 --> 00:34:34,448
There's two of them still living.

523
00:34:34,522 --> 00:34:38,686
I must say the family's been thinned out
nicely one way or another.

524
00:34:39,627 --> 00:34:43,791
Charlie, before we go out to my mum,
I must tell you...

525
00:34:43,865 --> 00:34:45,264
she's a bit mad.

526
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,267
You'll like her very much.
She's very funny.

527
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,929
But she may yatter away
about my father and my brother...

528
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,199
as though they were still alive.

529
00:34:52,707 --> 00:34:54,766
Just go along with her.
Do you understand?

530
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:58,209
I understand.
You don't want my Hershey bars.

531
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:01,877
I think it profane to enjoy this war.

532
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:08,278
I never realized what a sensual
satisfaction grieving is for women.

533
00:35:09,223 --> 00:35:12,056
I'm not sure that's a very tasteful thing
for you to say.

534
00:35:12,126 --> 00:35:16,085
I'm not sentimental about war.
I see nothing noble in widows.

535
00:35:17,064 --> 00:35:19,794
You're jealous of my husband. I like that.

536
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:28,607
Mother.

537
00:35:28,876 --> 00:35:31,003
You've brought chocolates,
two whole boxfuls.

538
00:35:31,078 --> 00:35:33,342
- What a treasure trove.
- I already refused them.

539
00:35:33,414 --> 00:35:36,076
- On ascetic grounds.
- You're an absolute flatulent, Emily.

540
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,640
Take the things if you want them.

541
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,243
I shall have one later
and save the rest for your father.

542
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:43,654
You must be Emily's new lover
since she hasn't bothered to introduce us.

543
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:44,986
You must be her mother.

544
00:35:45,059 --> 00:35:47,994
You found the chink in my armor.
What are your religious views?

545
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:51,463
- I'm a practicing coward.
- That's very fervent of you.

546
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,761
I should have known
you two would get on.

547
00:35:53,835 --> 00:35:55,803
You're as dotty as she is, Charlie.

548
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,395
Before the war,
I was an assistant night manager...

549
00:35:58,472 --> 00:36:00,337
of a diplomatic hotel in Washington, D.C.

550
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:01,739
What made you say that?

551
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:04,369
Lord, I feel like Alice at the tea party.

552
00:36:04,445 --> 00:36:06,845
He's going to tell us
about a religious experience.

553
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:11,317
Yes. It was my job as assistant
night manager to arrange things...

554
00:36:11,385 --> 00:36:15,344
for many of the great historical figures
on great historical missions.

555
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:16,981
What exactly did you arrange?

556
00:36:17,058 --> 00:36:20,221
Usually I arranged girls,
but individual tastes varied, of course.

557
00:36:20,294 --> 00:36:21,522
Of course.

558
00:36:21,796 --> 00:36:24,492
It's useful work, anyway,
especially in a war.

559
00:36:24,565 --> 00:36:27,534
I was offered all sorts of commissions
in the Army and the Navy.

560
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,038
The one I have now. Adm. Jessup
phoned me to join his staff...

561
00:36:31,105 --> 00:36:34,802
but I'd always been a little embarrassed
by my job at the hotel...

562
00:36:34,876 --> 00:36:37,071
and I wanted to do something redeeming.

563
00:36:37,144 --> 00:36:41,171
War is the only chance a man has
to do something redeeming.

564
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:44,912
- That's why war is so attractive.
- War's very handsome, I agree.

565
00:36:45,253 --> 00:36:48,120
At any rate, I turned down
Adm. Jessup's offer...

566
00:36:48,189 --> 00:36:50,157
and I enlisted in the Marines as a private.

567
00:36:50,224 --> 00:36:52,317
I even applied for combat service.

568
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:55,556
My wife, to all appearances
a perfectly sensible woman...

569
00:36:55,630 --> 00:36:57,996
encouraged me in this idiotic decision.

570
00:36:58,232 --> 00:37:02,168
Seven months later, I found myself
invading the Solomon Islands.

571
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:05,964
There I was splashing away
in the shoals of Guadalcanal.

572
00:37:06,507 --> 00:37:10,705
It occurred to me a man could get killed
doing this kind of thing.

573
00:37:10,778 --> 00:37:14,009
Fact is, most of the men
splashing along with me...

574
00:37:14,081 --> 00:37:16,276
were screaming in agony
and dying like flies.

575
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:18,409
Those were brave men dying there.

576
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:21,253
Peacetime, they'd all been
normal, decent cowards...

577
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:24,018
frightened of their wives,
trembling before their bosses...

578
00:37:24,091 --> 00:37:25,991
terrified of the passing of the years.

579
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:27,994
But war had made them gallant.

580
00:37:28,062 --> 00:37:31,088
They had been greedy men.
Now they were self-sacrificing.

581
00:37:31,165 --> 00:37:34,225
They had been selfish.
Now they were generous.

582
00:37:34,936 --> 00:37:37,427
War isn't hell at all. Man at his best.

583
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:39,939
The highest morality he's capable of.

584
00:37:40,007 --> 00:37:42,441
Never mind all that.
What's this about a wife?

585
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:45,843
That night,
I sat in the jungles of Guadalcanal...

586
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:48,538
waiting to be killed, sopping wet.

587
00:37:48,616 --> 00:37:51,084
It was then I had my blinding revelation.

588
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,220
I discovered I was a coward.

589
00:37:54,455 --> 00:37:56,889
That's my new religion.
I'm a big believer in it.

590
00:37:56,958 --> 00:38:00,985
Cowardice will save the world.
It's not war that's insane, you see.

591
00:38:01,062 --> 00:38:04,623
It's the morality of it. It's not greed
and ambition that makes wars.

592
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:05,961
It's goodness.

593
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,331
Wars are always fought
for the best of reasons...

594
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:10,563
for liberation or manifest destiny...

595
00:38:10,638 --> 00:38:14,267
always against tyranny
and always in the interest of humanity.

596
00:38:14,375 --> 00:38:16,366
So far this war
we've managed to butcher...

597
00:38:16,444 --> 00:38:18,776
some 10,000,000 humans
in the interest of humanity.

598
00:38:18,846 --> 00:38:21,576
Next war, it seems we'll have
to destroy all of man...

599
00:38:21,649 --> 00:38:23,708
in order to preserve his damn dignity.

600
00:38:23,784 --> 00:38:26,810
It's not war that's unnatural to us.
It's virtue.

601
00:38:27,188 --> 00:38:30,487
As long as valor remains a virtue
we shall have soldiers.

602
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:32,185
So I preach cowardice.

603
00:38:32,259 --> 00:38:34,159
Through cowardice, we shall all be saved.

604
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:38,062
That was exalting, Commander.
Absolutely occult.

605
00:38:38,366 --> 00:38:42,393
Never mind the metaphysics, Commander.
Let's get back to your wife.

606
00:38:42,470 --> 00:38:46,406
Needless to say, that first night,
I wrote Adm. Jessup, saying...

607
00:38:46,474 --> 00:38:48,499
"For heaven's sakes, get me out of this."

608
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,306
Two weeks later,
I was transferred back to Washington.

609
00:38:51,379 --> 00:38:52,869
I raced home to my wife...

610
00:38:52,947 --> 00:38:56,144
- And found her with another man.
- Lord, no.

611
00:38:56,217 --> 00:38:58,845
My wife, who had deceived me
more times before the war...

612
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,409
than I care to think about...

613
00:39:00,488 --> 00:39:03,389
was now having the time of her life
being faithful.

614
00:39:03,457 --> 00:39:05,857
She was furious with me for coming back.

615
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,656
There was no reason
for her being virtuous anymore.

616
00:39:08,729 --> 00:39:10,356
She promptly sued me for divorce...

617
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:12,194
on the grounds of religious differences.

618
00:39:12,266 --> 00:39:13,824
I was a self-preservationist...

619
00:39:13,901 --> 00:39:16,836
and she was a high
Anglican sentimentalist.

620
00:39:16,904 --> 00:39:20,135
You're fair game, then.

621
00:39:21,809 --> 00:39:25,336
After every war, you know we always
find out how unnecessary it was...

622
00:39:25,413 --> 00:39:27,540
and after this I'm sure all the generals...

623
00:39:27,615 --> 00:39:30,550
will write books about the blunders
made by other generals...

624
00:39:30,618 --> 00:39:33,143
and statesmen will publish
their secret diaries...

625
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:35,245
and it'll show beyond
any shadow of doubt...

626
00:39:35,322 --> 00:39:38,189
that war could easily have been avoided
in the first place.

627
00:39:38,259 --> 00:39:40,625
The rest of us, of course, will be left...

628
00:39:40,694 --> 00:39:44,391
with the job of bandaging the wounded
and burying the dead.

629
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:47,992
I don't trust people who make bitter
reflections about war, Mrs. Barham.

630
00:39:48,069 --> 00:39:50,196
It's the generals
with the bloodiest records...

631
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:52,705
who are the first to shout what a hell it is.

632
00:39:52,773 --> 00:39:56,265
It's always the war widows
who lead the Memorial Day parades.

633
00:39:56,343 --> 00:39:59,073
That was unkind, Charlie, and very rude.

634
00:39:59,513 --> 00:40:03,472
We shall never end wars, Mrs. Barham,
by blaming it on ministers and generals...

635
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:06,816
or warmongering imperialists
or all the other banal bogeys.

636
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:09,820
It's the rest of us who build statues
to those generals...

637
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:12,051
and name boulevards
after those ministers.

638
00:40:12,126 --> 00:40:14,424
The rest of us who make heroes
of our dead...

639
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,793
and shrines of our battlefields.

640
00:40:17,565 --> 00:40:20,625
We wear our widow's weeds
like nuns, Mrs. Barham...

641
00:40:20,701 --> 00:40:23,636
and perpetuate war
by exalting its sacrifices.

642
00:40:24,638 --> 00:40:26,606
My brother died at Anzio.

643
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,574
I didn't know that, Charlie.

644
00:40:29,777 --> 00:40:33,611
Yes. An everyday soldier's death,
no special heroism involved.

645
00:40:34,148 --> 00:40:36,480
They buried what pieces
they found of him.

646
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:41,010
But my mother insists he died a brave
death and pretends to be very proud.

647
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,323
You're very hard on your mother.

648
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,790
It seems a harmless enough pretense
to me.

649
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,885
No, Mrs. Barham.

650
00:40:48,062 --> 00:40:51,725
No. You see, now my other brother
can't wait to reach enlistment age.

651
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:54,290
- That'll be in September.
- Lord.

652
00:40:54,869 --> 00:40:58,600
Maybe ministers and generals
blunder us into war, Mrs. Barham...

653
00:40:58,672 --> 00:41:02,938
the least the rest of us can do is
to resist honoring the institution.

654
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:06,809
What has my mother got
for pretending bravery was admirable?

655
00:41:06,947 --> 00:41:08,608
She's under constant sedation...

656
00:41:08,682 --> 00:41:10,877
and terrified she may
wake up one morning...

657
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:13,784
and find her last son
has run off to be brave.

658
00:41:15,523 --> 00:41:19,584
I don't think I was rude or unkind before.
Do you, Mrs. Barham?

659
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:26,791
No.

660
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:33,396
You better push off, Emily,
if you've got to get to work.

661
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,843
Give my best to Father, then.

662
00:41:37,912 --> 00:41:40,142
Your father died in the blitz...

663
00:41:40,214 --> 00:41:44,310
and your brother died a brave
and pointless death in December 1940.

664
00:41:44,485 --> 00:41:47,420
- I've carried on much too long with all this.
- Mother.

665
00:41:47,488 --> 00:41:49,615
No, do go.
Honestly, I'd much rather be alone.

666
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,487
Really, I mean it.

667
00:41:52,359 --> 00:41:55,692
You're a kind man, Commander.
I hope you'll come again.

668
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,095
Thank you, ma'am. I'd like to.

669
00:42:17,716 --> 00:42:20,810
At the same time, Jesse,
it has to be a neap tide...

670
00:42:20,886 --> 00:42:25,323
so we can unload all the Army's heavy
stuff with a minimum of open beach.

671
00:42:26,492 --> 00:42:30,724
Jesse, D-day has to be June 5 or 6.

672
00:42:31,463 --> 00:42:35,627
We won't repeat these tidal conditions
for half a year, at least with a moon.

673
00:42:35,934 --> 00:42:38,425
That'll put us into the winter.

674
00:42:38,537 --> 00:42:40,869
Jesse, why don't we
knock off this briefing?

675
00:42:40,939 --> 00:42:44,375
- We've been at it since 3:00.
- Yeah, I'm tired.

676
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:49,579
It took me six months to get that
portable port plan to the Pentagon...

677
00:42:49,648 --> 00:42:51,240
let alone the British.

678
00:42:52,084 --> 00:42:55,781
I haven't had more than
two or three hours' sleep a night...

679
00:42:55,854 --> 00:42:59,017
since Florence died. I'm really worn out.

680
00:42:59,391 --> 00:43:02,849
Why don't we get a couple of beers
and get a decent night's sleep?

681
00:43:02,928 --> 00:43:06,591
Yeah. Let's really tie one on tonight.

682
00:43:07,065 --> 00:43:10,501
Bus, call Charlie Madison.
Tell him to set up a little bar in a hotel.

683
00:43:10,569 --> 00:43:11,831
Yes, sir.

684
00:43:17,109 --> 00:43:20,442
You remember we weren't called
midshipmen in those days...

685
00:43:20,512 --> 00:43:22,605
we were called naval cadets.

686
00:43:22,681 --> 00:43:23,841
Yeah!

687
00:43:26,852 --> 00:43:31,812
This was before Bancroft Hall
was turned into a dormitory...

688
00:43:31,890 --> 00:43:35,758
because they found
the O.O.D. Sitting there with his...

689
00:43:38,964 --> 00:43:42,923
You remember when they christened
the canvas!

690
00:43:43,001 --> 00:43:47,563
Anyway, "Hey, you cadet,"
said this jimmy leg.

691
00:44:03,689 --> 00:44:05,452
Jesse?

692
00:44:06,692 --> 00:44:10,128
Jesse, you think they're gonna...

693
00:44:10,662 --> 00:44:13,995
unify the services after the war?

694
00:44:15,234 --> 00:44:17,134
Yeah. It looks that way.

695
00:44:19,338 --> 00:44:22,068
A joint committee on military affairs...

696
00:44:22,741 --> 00:44:26,199
is holding a hearing. The end of June.

697
00:44:27,512 --> 00:44:31,141
Ostensibly, it's about the Army's
new bomber program.

698
00:44:32,317 --> 00:44:35,013
It's really about the Army pushing to be...

699
00:44:35,087 --> 00:44:37,647
the dominant service
in the military establishment.

700
00:44:37,723 --> 00:44:41,819
A lot of talk about the Air Corps
becoming a separate service.

701
00:44:41,893 --> 00:44:45,920
Yeah. Every senator in Washington...

702
00:44:46,531 --> 00:44:49,193
is infatuated with strategic bombing.

703
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:53,197
You don't win a war
with strategic bombers!

704
00:44:53,272 --> 00:44:54,534
Right!

705
00:44:54,606 --> 00:44:58,133
If you did, Hitler would be sitting
in this room right now instead of us.

706
00:44:58,210 --> 00:45:02,306
Right! Hitler ruled the sky.
He had the greatest army in the world.

707
00:45:02,514 --> 00:45:06,245
But he couldn't make it across
30 miles of English Channel.

708
00:45:06,318 --> 00:45:07,342
Right.

709
00:45:07,419 --> 00:45:10,911
Hitler had everything, except a navy.

710
00:45:12,691 --> 00:45:14,386
Now he's finished.

711
00:45:16,695 --> 00:45:19,789
This planet is five-sixths water!

712
00:45:20,599 --> 00:45:23,466
God made it that way,
and that's the way it's gonna stay.

713
00:45:23,535 --> 00:45:26,129
In this world, you're as strong
as your sea power.

714
00:45:26,204 --> 00:45:28,331
- You tell them, Jesse!
- Damn right.

715
00:45:31,877 --> 00:45:35,108
My father was class of 1869.

716
00:45:36,615 --> 00:45:38,344
He beat the Army 2-0...

717
00:45:38,417 --> 00:45:40,817
when they were still pitching baseball
underhanded.

718
00:45:40,886 --> 00:45:43,286
I wish he was pitching for us this year.

719
00:45:43,355 --> 00:45:47,223
My grandfather died slipping a sloop...

720
00:45:47,659 --> 00:45:50,184
through the Union blockade at Charleston.

721
00:45:50,262 --> 00:45:52,389
I knew we'd get back to the Civil War.

722
00:45:52,464 --> 00:45:57,333
My people have shipped out for this
country under sail, wood and diesel...

723
00:45:58,136 --> 00:46:02,835
ever since Capt. John Smith left
a Jessup to hold Jamestown in 1610.

724
00:46:02,974 --> 00:46:06,671
And I'm damned if I'm going to see
the Navy sucking runt's udder in my time.

725
00:46:06,745 --> 00:46:08,212
I'll tell you that!

726
00:46:10,916 --> 00:46:12,076
By golly!

727
00:46:12,751 --> 00:46:16,016
Bus, how is that movie coming along?

728
00:46:16,088 --> 00:46:17,487
- Movie, sir?
- Yeah.

729
00:46:17,556 --> 00:46:19,251
What...

730
00:46:19,858 --> 00:46:22,554
- Sir, are you all right?
- Jesse?

731
00:46:22,761 --> 00:46:26,026
You know, something very strange
is happening to me.

732
00:46:26,198 --> 00:46:28,530
I'm beginning to like tea.

733
00:46:29,134 --> 00:46:30,499
With milk?

734
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,561
Charlie? Better come here.

735
00:46:37,142 --> 00:46:39,906
Florence!

736
00:46:40,078 --> 00:46:42,546
- Take it easy.
- Florence!

737
00:46:42,614 --> 00:46:44,377
- Florence!
- Easy, Jesse.

738
00:46:44,449 --> 00:46:47,782
I've got him, sir.
Help me get him on the bed, Bus.

739
00:46:47,853 --> 00:46:51,016
- Think we ought to call a doctor?
- No, he'll be all right, sir.

740
00:46:51,089 --> 00:46:55,025
Here we go. On the other side, Bus.
Here we go, sir.

741
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:58,921
Good. There you go. Right.

742
00:46:59,631 --> 00:47:01,292
What happened, Bus?

743
00:47:01,666 --> 00:47:04,794
I don't know.
He asked me about that movie.

744
00:47:04,870 --> 00:47:07,930
I told him I couldn't locate
any photographer's mates.

745
00:47:08,006 --> 00:47:10,531
Since he hadn't brought it up again,
I let it slide.

746
00:47:10,609 --> 00:47:13,100
He started yelling for his wife.
We couldn't stop him.

747
00:47:13,178 --> 00:47:14,805
All right. I'll take care of him.

748
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,939
You see Admirals Healy and Hoyle out,
will you?

749
00:47:17,015 --> 00:47:18,243
Yes. Sure.

750
00:47:18,350 --> 00:47:21,342
- Charlie?
- Yes, sir.

751
00:47:23,021 --> 00:47:26,013
Charlie, I want you to make
that movie for me.

752
00:47:26,358 --> 00:47:28,292
I want you to take charge, Charlie.

753
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:32,490
- I want you to make that movie for me.
- You just leave it to me, sir.

754
00:47:40,272 --> 00:47:43,901
We might as well see some of this film
before the Admiral comes.

755
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:46,174
Combat engineers in training.

756
00:47:46,244 --> 00:47:49,042
<i>This is a beach somewhere</i>
<i>on the west coast of Wales.</i>

757
00:47:49,114 --> 00:47:52,709
<i>It has been prepared to be an</i>
<i>exact duplicate of the beaches of France...</i>

758
00:47:52,784 --> 00:47:55,309
<i>where the invasion of Europe</i>
<i>will take place.</i>

759
00:47:55,387 --> 00:47:57,855
<i>Every foot has been mined.</i>

760
00:47:57,923 --> 00:48:01,882
<i>Three years of German ingenuity have</i>
<i>gone into making that beach impregnable.</i>

761
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,726
<i>How will we get troops, tanks,</i>
<i>and weapons across that beach?</i>

762
00:48:05,797 --> 00:48:09,062
<i>That's the job of the</i>
<i>Navy Combat Demolition Engineers.</i>

763
00:48:09,134 --> 00:48:11,261
How did I get into this, anyway?

764
00:48:11,336 --> 00:48:13,327
<i>Here on this secret beach in Wales...</i>

765
00:48:13,405 --> 00:48:16,602
<i>the Navy engineers train</i>
<i>for their hazardous duty.</i>

766
00:48:17,142 --> 00:48:19,007
<i>This is only a dry run.</i>

767
00:48:19,077 --> 00:48:20,408
<i>On D-day these engineers...</i>

768
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,107
<i>will be under heavy mortar</i>
<i>and artillery fire.</i>

769
00:48:25,684 --> 00:48:26,981
Thanks a lot!

770
00:48:27,085 --> 00:48:29,417
Shut up, Charlie.
I'm trying to watch the picture.

771
00:48:29,488 --> 00:48:33,015
You won't like it, Marv. Got lousy reviews.

772
00:48:33,158 --> 00:48:35,922
<i>Each squad must clear an alley</i>
<i>50 feet wide...</i>

773
00:48:35,994 --> 00:48:38,690
<i>for our troops to advance on the beaches.</i>

774
00:48:41,233 --> 00:48:44,168
<i>These American sailors</i>
<i>will actually be the first men...</i>

775
00:48:44,236 --> 00:48:46,932
<i>to assault Hitler's European bastion.</i>

776
00:48:47,005 --> 00:48:51,305
That fact, Charlie, is exactly
what I want clearly recorded on film.

777
00:48:51,409 --> 00:48:53,036
I want you and your photographers...

778
00:48:53,111 --> 00:48:55,409
to get into the water
with those engineers.

779
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:57,539
Film their activities
right up to the beaches.

780
00:48:57,616 --> 00:49:00,449
Would you like us to start the movie
from the beginning, sir?

781
00:49:00,519 --> 00:49:02,111
No, I've got to run.

782
00:49:02,187 --> 00:49:04,348
You're on the right track, Charlie.

783
00:49:06,424 --> 00:49:09,325
- Sir?
- Yes, Charlie?

784
00:49:09,427 --> 00:49:13,295
Sir, I get the feeling
a man could get killed making this movie.

785
00:49:13,365 --> 00:49:15,925
A lot of men are going to get killed
on D-day, Charlie.

786
00:49:16,001 --> 00:49:18,367
I would like to be relieved
of this assignment, sir.

787
00:49:18,436 --> 00:49:21,633
Seems like a lot of risk to take
for no particular reason.

788
00:49:21,706 --> 00:49:24,470
I'm ordering you to make
this film, Commander.

789
00:49:24,543 --> 00:49:26,067
That's reason enough.

790
00:49:26,745 --> 00:49:30,112
Seems to me, sir,
the only thing at stake here...

791
00:49:30,181 --> 00:49:32,115
is a matter of naval public relations.

792
00:49:32,183 --> 00:49:36,279
No, Commander. What's at stake here
is the essence of military structure...

793
00:49:36,521 --> 00:49:38,386
the inviolability of command.

794
00:49:38,490 --> 00:49:40,355
I've given you an order.

795
00:49:40,692 --> 00:49:43,855
You'll obey it, or I'll have you brigged.
Is that clear?

796
00:49:43,929 --> 00:49:45,362
Yes, sir.

797
00:49:53,872 --> 00:49:56,397
What do we do now?

798
00:49:59,044 --> 00:50:00,909
I don't know what Marvin's going to do...

799
00:50:00,979 --> 00:50:03,209
I'm going back to the office
to cut your orders.

800
00:50:03,281 --> 00:50:04,509
What orders?

801
00:50:04,583 --> 00:50:07,347
Orders authorizing you
to transfer unattached personnel...

802
00:50:07,419 --> 00:50:08,852
to your photographic unit.

803
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,616
Come on, Bus. I'm not going to make
any silly movie.

804
00:50:11,690 --> 00:50:15,023
There are no unattached photographic
personnel. I've already checked.

805
00:50:15,093 --> 00:50:17,027
So you report to me about that next week.

806
00:50:17,095 --> 00:50:19,120
Then I'll cut you new orders,
flight orders...

807
00:50:19,197 --> 00:50:20,664
pay orders, temporary duty orders.

808
00:50:20,732 --> 00:50:23,895
Before I finish cutting orders
for this movie, the war will be over.

809
00:50:23,969 --> 00:50:26,665
- Do this my way, Charlie.
- I don't like it. It's devious.

810
00:50:26,738 --> 00:50:29,263
You've already tried
the forthright frontal assault...

811
00:50:29,341 --> 00:50:31,070
nearly got yourself court-martialed...

812
00:50:31,142 --> 00:50:32,404
stripped of your commission...

813
00:50:32,477 --> 00:50:35,173
sent to the Arctic Circle
to do polar research.

814
00:50:35,347 --> 00:50:39,283
Man, you don't tell two-star admirals
you don't approve of their orders.

815
00:50:39,417 --> 00:50:41,351
Now you're on the Admiral's brig list.

816
00:50:41,419 --> 00:50:44,513
I'll assign you to Exeter, Portland
or some other channel ports...

817
00:50:44,589 --> 00:50:47,581
for the purpose
of making preliminary investigations...

818
00:50:47,659 --> 00:50:50,651
And you just stay
out of the Admiral's sight.

819
00:50:51,262 --> 00:50:55,665
I'll assign Emily as your driver,
and you just have yourself a vacation.

820
00:50:56,001 --> 00:50:57,764
Now, do this my way.

821
00:51:03,642 --> 00:51:06,042
A nutty situation, Marv?

822
00:51:11,049 --> 00:51:14,212
All right, I'll go to Sussex
with Emily for a week.

823
00:51:14,285 --> 00:51:16,446
Not such a bad deal.

824
00:51:16,521 --> 00:51:19,319
Sussex should be lovely
at this time of year.

825
00:51:23,828 --> 00:51:26,695
Sheila would say,
"It's too bloody lovely. Really, it is."

826
00:51:26,765 --> 00:51:29,199
She's not doing the bloody poling.

827
00:51:29,267 --> 00:51:31,895
It's defiant, is it? Just give it a big push.

828
00:51:38,009 --> 00:51:39,135
Help!

829
00:52:10,341 --> 00:52:12,673
Charlie.

830
00:52:23,121 --> 00:52:24,645
I love you, Emily.

831
00:52:35,867 --> 00:52:38,165
How many more weeks do we have?

832
00:52:38,236 --> 00:52:39,965
Three, maybe four.

833
00:52:40,371 --> 00:52:43,067
I know Adm. Jessup
has to be back in Washington...

834
00:52:43,141 --> 00:52:44,733
by the end of June.

835
00:52:49,114 --> 00:52:51,582
Lord, I hope I don't get pregnant.

836
00:52:56,387 --> 00:53:00,517
I've told myself a hundred times,
don't get earnest about this man.

837
00:53:00,725 --> 00:53:04,058
It's a casual thing.
A brief, passionate explosion.

838
00:53:04,796 --> 00:53:07,697
Don't get sticky about it,
for heaven's sake.

839
00:53:09,934 --> 00:53:13,392
I'm sticky, Charlie. I'm sticky as hell.

840
00:53:14,939 --> 00:53:17,203
I'm insanely in love with you.

841
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:22,743
Have you ever given any thought
to getting married?

842
00:53:28,586 --> 00:53:31,817
You really do cut to the core of things,
don't you?

843
00:53:33,224 --> 00:53:36,057
I've got some
Navy marriage applications here.

844
00:53:40,765 --> 00:53:43,097
Charlie, let's be honest about this.

845
00:53:43,168 --> 00:53:46,501
Emily, we're nuts about each other.
Let's get married.

846
00:53:53,978 --> 00:53:56,469
But we're basically incompatible, Charlie.

847
00:53:58,216 --> 00:54:00,343
It's got nothing to do with that.

848
00:54:00,852 --> 00:54:03,218
It's our fundamental approaches to life.

849
00:54:03,288 --> 00:54:05,984
I've got this ingrained British morality...

850
00:54:06,257 --> 00:54:09,021
and you're the most immoral man
I've ever met.

851
00:54:09,661 --> 00:54:13,062
You're a shameless coward,
selfish as a child...

852
00:54:15,066 --> 00:54:18,467
and you're pretty ruthless
about getting what you want.

853
00:54:21,573 --> 00:54:24,542
For all your charm,
you're a scoundrel, Charlie.

854
00:54:26,978 --> 00:54:30,175
Seems I don't mind
making love to a scoundrel...

855
00:54:30,748 --> 00:54:33,216
but I think it immoral to marry one.

856
00:54:38,256 --> 00:54:40,281
You lack principles, Charlie.

857
00:54:40,358 --> 00:54:42,417
Isn't there anything you'd die for?

858
00:54:42,493 --> 00:54:44,154
Sure.

859
00:54:44,629 --> 00:54:47,029
I'd die for you, if it ever came to that.

860
00:54:48,299 --> 00:54:50,290
I really believe you would.

861
00:54:57,242 --> 00:55:00,040
There are lots of things I'd die for, Emily.

862
00:55:00,111 --> 00:55:03,080
My home, my family, my country.

863
00:55:04,515 --> 00:55:06,506
But that's love, not principle.

864
00:55:07,752 --> 00:55:10,448
Now, if I were to bring
a raging lion into the house...

865
00:55:10,521 --> 00:55:13,319
and wrestle it just to prove
that I'd die for you...

866
00:55:13,391 --> 00:55:15,825
that would be highly principled of me.

867
00:55:16,027 --> 00:55:19,827
But what's a lion doing
in a man's house, anyway?

868
00:55:21,666 --> 00:55:23,133
Shut up.

869
00:55:51,829 --> 00:55:55,856
Charlie, I've been so silly.
Of course I'll marry you.

870
00:55:56,467 --> 00:55:59,300
I'll give you the signed documents
in the morning.

871
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:02,328
I love you so.

872
00:56:05,376 --> 00:56:08,038
Lord, I hope you do get pregnant.

873
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:04,032
What?

874
00:57:04,469 --> 00:57:06,630
What is this?

875
00:57:13,945 --> 00:57:16,709
- All right.
- I don't do this kind of thing.

876
00:57:16,781 --> 00:57:19,579
- Shut up.
- What is this all about?

877
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:22,244
- Close the door.
- I'm a decent girl.

878
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:24,584
- Will you shut up?
- He's got the bloody lights on!

879
00:57:24,655 --> 00:57:26,885
- Turn the lights off!
- I want to read this to you!

880
00:57:26,958 --> 00:57:28,289
I know what it is. I drew it up!

881
00:57:28,359 --> 00:57:31,192
It is an order assigning me
to a demolition unit in Portland!

882
00:57:31,262 --> 00:57:33,992
- I know what it is!
- What are you yelling about?

883
00:57:34,065 --> 00:57:36,363
- Don't you ever knock?
- All right, I'm sorry!

884
00:57:36,434 --> 00:57:39,870
For Pete's sake, Charlie.
Will you stop jumping around?

885
00:57:40,505 --> 00:57:43,906
I'm naked, dear.
I'm looking for something to put on.

886
00:57:44,409 --> 00:57:47,776
This is my best friend, you dotty witch,
not the house detective.

887
00:57:47,845 --> 00:57:51,440
Now, just stand at attention
while Cmdr. Madison and I confer.

888
00:57:52,683 --> 00:57:54,844
Charlie, ever since
you're away all the time...

889
00:57:54,919 --> 00:57:56,853
I have to dig up my own girls.

890
00:57:57,422 --> 00:58:01,051
The Admiral came into my office
yesterday morning and said...

891
00:58:01,125 --> 00:58:03,889
"I want Madison immediately assigned
to a demolition unit."

892
00:58:03,961 --> 00:58:05,986
I cut your orders.
You and your camera crew...

893
00:58:06,064 --> 00:58:08,794
report to the port commander, Portland.
2200 hours, June 4.

894
00:58:08,866 --> 00:58:10,094
Tomorrow is June 4.

895
00:58:10,168 --> 00:58:12,136
I know tomorrow is June 4.
Fill in the names.

896
00:58:12,203 --> 00:58:13,227
What names?

897
00:58:13,304 --> 00:58:15,966
- Names of your camera crew.
- I don't have any camera crew.

898
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:17,473
What's the matter with you, Bus?

899
00:58:17,542 --> 00:58:19,510
I know you don't have any camera crew.

900
00:58:19,577 --> 00:58:21,204
But by 1000 hours tomorrow morning...

901
00:58:21,279 --> 00:58:23,941
I'll cut flight orders
for this camera you don't have...

902
00:58:24,015 --> 00:58:26,506
on the 1900 hours flight to Portland...

903
00:58:26,617 --> 00:58:30,348
with a copy of each to COMINT, SHAEF,
COMNAVEU, COMLANCRABEU...

904
00:58:30,421 --> 00:58:32,889
and Port Commander,
Portland, PORLANCRABEAU.

905
00:58:32,990 --> 00:58:35,458
It will take me two hours
to rescind those orders...

906
00:58:35,526 --> 00:58:37,187
let alone draft new flight orders...

907
00:58:37,261 --> 00:58:39,456
new requisition orders, new pay orders.

908
00:58:39,530 --> 00:58:41,964
Don't get swept up with the sheer artistry
of it all.

909
00:58:42,033 --> 00:58:44,263
Look. These orders specifically
assign me...

910
00:58:44,335 --> 00:58:45,996
to the 6th Naval Engineer Unit.

911
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:49,164
That makes this whole silly movie,
official Navy business...

912
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,040
with a copy each for COMINT, SHAEF,
and PORLANCRABEAU.

913
00:58:55,246 --> 00:58:58,044
- The balloon is going up any day now.
- Will you stop...

914
00:58:58,116 --> 00:59:01,051
No. The Admiral's been at Southampton
to Supreme Command...

915
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:03,178
more often than he's been in town
this week.

916
00:59:03,254 --> 00:59:05,188
Now, Charlie! Trust me.

917
00:59:07,925 --> 00:59:09,153
All right.

918
00:59:09,794 --> 00:59:13,787
Bus, could you assign Emily and me
to the Lake District next week?

919
00:59:13,865 --> 00:59:16,265
That's lovely up there.

920
00:59:20,671 --> 00:59:22,901
This one really takes the cake.

921
00:59:24,175 --> 00:59:26,643
We don't have anything
in the Lake District, Charlie.

922
00:59:26,711 --> 00:59:29,908
What about Cornwall? Land's End,
rocky cliffs over looking the sea.

923
00:59:29,981 --> 00:59:31,039
It's very romantic.

924
00:59:31,115 --> 00:59:33,015
I have a training station at Falmouth.

925
00:59:33,084 --> 00:59:34,051
I can assign you there.

926
00:59:34,118 --> 00:59:36,382
Sounds very nice. We'll take it.

927
00:59:36,487 --> 00:59:38,751
Bus, I'm marrying her.

928
00:59:42,193 --> 00:59:43,524
Charlie!

929
00:59:43,594 --> 00:59:45,926
- You're getting a great girl.
- Thanks, Bus.

930
00:59:45,997 --> 00:59:47,931
I'm going to throw you
the biggest spread...

931
00:59:47,999 --> 00:59:50,092
this whole town has ever seen. The works!

932
00:59:50,168 --> 00:59:52,966
Formal Annapolis wedding,
arch of sabers, everything.

933
00:59:53,037 --> 00:59:55,028
Congratulations, sailor.

934
00:59:55,106 --> 00:59:57,336
Thanks, mate.
I'll see you tomorrow in the office?

935
00:59:57,408 --> 00:59:59,968
- Tomorrow morning, buddy.
- Right, buddy.

936
01:00:06,417 --> 01:00:08,783
You may stand at ease now, sailor.

937
01:00:10,988 --> 01:00:13,582
I don't want 90 proof.
This is for some Russians.

938
01:00:13,658 --> 01:00:16,821
They're always making cracks
about the impotence of American vodka.

939
01:00:16,894 --> 01:00:18,691
Cmdr. Cummings
in Adm. Jessup's office.

940
01:00:18,763 --> 01:00:19,821
Is lmogene there?

941
01:00:19,897 --> 01:00:23,230
Please have Caroline bring
Adm. Jessup's car at 0930 exactly.

942
01:00:23,301 --> 01:00:26,168
Russians still like their women
short, fat and reactionary?

943
01:00:26,237 --> 01:00:27,329
As far as I know, they do.

944
01:00:27,405 --> 01:00:31,501
Now, Jesse, we come to
your research project on the Arctic Circle.

945
01:00:31,909 --> 01:00:35,640
We received a second cable
yesterday afternoon from Norris.

946
01:00:36,681 --> 01:00:40,549
Jesse, your North Pole project
is going to go down the drain...

947
01:00:40,751 --> 01:00:43,652
unless you start raising a little hell again.
Jesse!

948
01:00:48,993 --> 01:00:51,587
Lmogene, you haven't lost any weight,
have you?

949
01:00:51,662 --> 01:00:53,129
Come here a minute.

950
01:00:53,297 --> 01:00:54,764
I said, come here a minute.

951
01:00:54,832 --> 01:00:56,527
I'll call you back.

952
01:01:00,238 --> 01:01:01,796
My God!

953
01:01:02,473 --> 01:01:04,100
Holy cow.

954
01:01:04,175 --> 01:01:06,973
- Jesse.
- We better get a doctor.

955
01:01:07,044 --> 01:01:09,979
He's supposed to be in Southampton
in an hour...

956
01:01:10,047 --> 01:01:12,106
at a meeting
of the Joint Supreme Command.

957
01:01:12,183 --> 01:01:13,172
You're out of your mind.

958
01:01:13,251 --> 01:01:15,617
He's in a schizophrenic state.
Get him to a hospital.

959
01:01:15,686 --> 01:01:16,744
I suppose you're right.

960
01:01:16,821 --> 01:01:19,187
- He really flipped.
- Get me a hospital, quick.

961
01:01:19,257 --> 01:01:21,725
I'd better tell Admiral Healy about this.

962
01:01:27,865 --> 01:01:28,957
Hiya, Bus.

963
01:01:29,033 --> 01:01:30,967
Harry, something serious
has just happened.

964
01:01:31,035 --> 01:01:32,764
Adm. Jessup's gone mad.

965
01:01:32,837 --> 01:01:34,998
He's flipped.
Will you tell Admiral Healy about it?

966
01:01:35,072 --> 01:01:36,334
Admiral Healy's on his way...

967
01:01:36,407 --> 01:01:38,637
to Southampton with Adm. Jessup
in five minutes.

968
01:01:38,709 --> 01:01:41,109
No, Adm. Jessup isn't going
to Southampton, Harry.

969
01:01:41,178 --> 01:01:43,237
This is urgent.
Adm. Jessup has cracked up.

970
01:01:43,314 --> 01:01:46,078
- What do you mean, he's cracked up?
- I mean he's cracked up.

971
01:01:46,150 --> 01:01:49,642
He's lying on the floor right now
in his office in a trance.

972
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:51,813
Do I read you right, Commander?

973
01:01:52,723 --> 01:01:56,659
Are you trying to tell me
Adm. William Jessup has cracked up?

974
01:01:57,361 --> 01:02:00,159
You know, Harry, you are a pompous ass!

975
01:02:01,732 --> 01:02:03,359
Now this better not be a gag.

976
01:02:03,434 --> 01:02:05,868
You think I would joke
about a thing like this?

977
01:02:05,936 --> 01:02:08,962
The service takes a dim view
of lieutenant commanders...

978
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:12,999
who call the Special Assistant
to the Secretary of the Navy a nut.

979
01:02:13,077 --> 01:02:15,443
Come on. You see for yourself, wise guy.

980
01:02:20,017 --> 01:02:21,780
Hello, Harry. Adm. Healy ready?

981
01:02:21,852 --> 01:02:23,183
He's waiting for you now, sir.

982
01:02:23,254 --> 01:02:25,779
Admirals Hoyle and Magneson are with...

983
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:29,053
- All right, what the hell is all this about?
- Harry, in here.

984
01:02:29,126 --> 01:02:31,117
The Admiral is a very sick man.

985
01:02:31,195 --> 01:02:34,130
This kind of a joke is tasteless enough
from you two.

986
01:02:34,198 --> 01:02:37,964
But from an academy man, it is obscene!

987
01:02:38,135 --> 01:02:42,299
You shore sailors ought to do a little tour
of sea duty just to find out exactly...

988
01:02:42,373 --> 01:02:45,467
All right, Spaulding, I've had about enough
of your bilge.

989
01:02:45,543 --> 01:02:49,445
This blowhard here did four months...

990
01:02:49,513 --> 01:02:53,882
as a mess officer in the South Pacific,
and he's been spouting sea salt ever since.

991
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:55,816
I didn't ask for a desk job.

992
01:02:55,886 --> 01:02:59,413
I've applied for sea duty seven times,
and you know it.

993
01:02:59,490 --> 01:03:00,514
If you'll let me finish...

994
01:03:00,591 --> 01:03:02,923
Don't just start pulling academy on me.

995
01:03:02,993 --> 01:03:04,961
I was a cadet four-striper.

996
01:03:05,029 --> 01:03:07,964
You never made more than midshipman
of a lousy battalion.

997
01:03:08,032 --> 01:03:11,092
This outburst is bad joss,
Commander, bad joss.

998
01:03:11,168 --> 01:03:14,228
Don't start jacking me up
like you were my senior cadet officer.

999
01:03:14,305 --> 01:03:16,671
While you two schoolboys
are standing here...

1000
01:03:16,741 --> 01:03:19,437
And I don't want to hear
any more cracks about schoolboys.

1001
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:22,001
You civilian sailors think
there's something funny...

1002
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:24,377
about a man taking pride in his service.

1003
01:03:24,448 --> 01:03:27,679
Sir, permit me to inform you, sir...

1004
01:03:27,752 --> 01:03:31,347
that I am damn proud of being
an Annapolis man, sir.

1005
01:03:34,959 --> 01:03:39,055
- Look, right now...
- I didn't ask for a lousy desk job.

1006
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:41,598
I've got bad eyes. Now, what can I do?

1007
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,493
You think I wanna to tell my kids
that on D-day...

1008
01:03:44,568 --> 01:03:47,002
their father was shacked up
at the Westchester Hotel?

1009
01:03:47,071 --> 01:03:48,402
For Pete's sake, Bus.

1010
01:03:48,472 --> 01:03:51,134
- Adm. Healy wants to see you, Bus.
- What happened?

1011
01:03:51,208 --> 01:03:53,836
I don't know. They took Adm. Jessup
back to his hotel.

1012
01:03:53,911 --> 01:03:55,208
He's flipped again.

1013
01:03:55,279 --> 01:03:57,907
- We better go to the hotel, Charlie.
- No, wait here.

1014
01:03:57,982 --> 01:04:02,214
Healy may want to see both of you, too.
We're getting a doctor for him.

1015
01:04:05,423 --> 01:04:09,120
A movie to show the first dead man
on Omaha Beach was sailor?

1016
01:04:09,193 --> 01:04:10,182
Yes, sir.

1017
01:04:10,261 --> 01:04:13,389
I got an odd letter from
the Under Chief of Naval Operations today.

1018
01:04:13,464 --> 01:04:16,126
That's what I was discussing with Jesse
when he went wild.

1019
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:17,633
It's nearly 9:40, Tom.

1020
01:04:17,701 --> 01:04:20,636
I know, just a minute. Yes, here it is.

1021
01:04:20,704 --> 01:04:24,401
"The President expressed interest in
some moving picture Jessup is making."

1022
01:04:24,475 --> 01:04:27,205
Jessup has written directly to
the President about this.

1023
01:04:27,278 --> 01:04:29,178
I wish Jesse would keep me informed...

1024
01:04:29,246 --> 01:04:30,907
even of these private projects of his.

1025
01:04:30,981 --> 01:04:34,280
"At the end of the meeting, Harry Begely,
the President's assistant...

1026
01:04:34,351 --> 01:04:37,149
"made reference to a tomb
for the Unknown Sailor."

1027
01:04:37,421 --> 01:04:40,322
What tomb
for the Unknown Sailor, Commander?

1028
01:04:40,391 --> 01:04:43,690
I don't know, sir.
I had no idea that Adm. Jessup...

1029
01:04:43,761 --> 01:04:46,321
was in communication with the President
or Harry Begely.

1030
01:04:46,397 --> 01:04:48,922
Does anyone know about
a tomb for the Unknown Sailor?

1031
01:04:48,999 --> 01:04:51,763
I assume Jessup meant
the first dead sailor on Omaha Beach...

1032
01:04:51,836 --> 01:04:53,167
to be the sailor in the tomb.

1033
01:04:53,237 --> 01:04:54,226
What tomb?

1034
01:04:54,305 --> 01:04:57,797
- The tomb for the Unknown Sailor, sir.
- There is no...

1035
01:04:59,677 --> 01:05:02,441
I see. Another one of Jesse's projects.

1036
01:05:03,247 --> 01:05:06,444
Commander, this movie about
the demolition engineers.

1037
01:05:06,517 --> 01:05:08,542
- Is such a movie being made?
- Not really, sir.

1038
01:05:08,619 --> 01:05:10,484
- You see, we've been trying...
- Get it made.

1039
01:05:10,554 --> 01:05:13,045
I want this incident closed,
and I want it closed fast.

1040
01:05:13,123 --> 01:05:15,717
I don't want anything that's happened
to get out of here.

1041
01:05:15,793 --> 01:05:17,761
I don't even want the President
to know this.

1042
01:05:17,828 --> 01:05:18,817
Tom.

1043
01:05:18,896 --> 01:05:21,865
Put together a movie, Commander,
I can give to Mr. Begely...

1044
01:05:21,932 --> 01:05:23,263
who can show it to the President...

1045
01:05:23,334 --> 01:05:25,359
who will write a polite note
to Adm. Jessup...

1046
01:05:25,436 --> 01:05:27,927
- and this unhappy matter will be closed.
- Yes, sir.

1047
01:05:28,005 --> 01:05:31,372
Harry, I am to be informed every hour
as to Adm. Jessup's condition.

1048
01:05:31,442 --> 01:05:34,343
- Yes, sir.
- A hell of a day for this to happen.

1049
01:05:39,283 --> 01:05:42,741
Now what is so crazy about a tomb
for the Unknown Sailor?

1050
01:05:43,521 --> 01:05:46,649
I think there's something splendid
in the idea.

1051
01:05:47,858 --> 01:05:50,725
Yes, it does have a ring to it, doesn't it?

1052
01:05:54,999 --> 01:05:56,830
How's the old man, Bus?

1053
01:05:57,635 --> 01:06:01,696
The President has expressed
an interest in Adm. Jessup's movie.

1054
01:06:02,006 --> 01:06:03,098
Naturally.

1055
01:06:03,340 --> 01:06:05,433
The Navy has committed itself
to this movie...

1056
01:06:05,509 --> 01:06:08,672
and it'll be pretty damned embarrassing
if it isn't made.

1057
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:13,277
So, Charlie, we're going
to make that movie.

1058
01:06:13,350 --> 01:06:15,511
That's very spunky of you, Bus.

1059
01:06:15,586 --> 01:06:19,454
You and I are going to get on that
2100 flight to Portland this evening...

1060
01:06:19,523 --> 01:06:21,184
and we're going to make a movie!

1061
01:06:21,258 --> 01:06:22,885
I'm going in this with you, buddy.

1062
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,588
I'm cutting orders
for the both of us right now.

1063
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:28,461
Damn it, Charlie. It's exciting, isn't it?

1064
01:06:28,532 --> 01:06:30,625
Will you quit giving me
these comradely pokes?

1065
01:06:30,701 --> 01:06:33,169
This is it, boy. This is the big show.

1066
01:06:33,237 --> 01:06:35,637
And we're going to be in there
for the first shot.

1067
01:06:35,706 --> 01:06:39,642
Just how did you and I suddenly become
The Charge of the Light Brigade?

1068
01:06:39,710 --> 01:06:40,870
Charlie...

1069
01:06:40,945 --> 01:06:44,403
there's a lot more to this movie
than we knew about.

1070
01:06:45,783 --> 01:06:49,810
The Admiral had a much larger vision
in mind.

1071
01:06:50,888 --> 01:06:52,253
Apparently...

1072
01:06:53,490 --> 01:06:58,189
the Admiral's idea is to build a tomb
for the Unknown Sailor.

1073
01:06:59,997 --> 01:07:03,160
And to put the first dead man
on Omaha Beach into it.

1074
01:07:05,769 --> 01:07:07,600
Tomb for the what?

1075
01:07:07,671 --> 01:07:10,265
That's a new one on me.

1076
01:07:10,341 --> 01:07:12,502
All right, sailors, that'll be all.

1077
01:07:12,576 --> 01:07:15,204
The Navy wants this movie made
and it's going to be made.

1078
01:07:15,279 --> 01:07:17,941
You get back to your hotel
and pack your gear...

1079
01:07:18,182 --> 01:07:21,618
because we're going on that 2100 flight
to Portland this evening.

1080
01:07:21,685 --> 01:07:23,949
That's an order, Commander.

1081
01:07:24,221 --> 01:07:28,317
A tomb for the Unknown Sailor.
Holy cow, Bus!

1082
01:07:28,392 --> 01:07:31,919
- Take it easy, Charlie.
- Charlie, you and I have had it too easy.

1083
01:07:32,062 --> 01:07:35,589
I think we've forgotten we're officers
in the United States Navy.

1084
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:37,691
It's not up to us to approve our orders...

1085
01:07:37,768 --> 01:07:40,259
even if those orders
mean risking our lives.

1086
01:07:41,905 --> 01:07:43,873
These are your orders, Charlie.

1087
01:07:43,941 --> 01:07:46,034
We'll have a mimeographed copy
in half an hour.

1088
01:07:46,110 --> 01:07:47,475
We've been through this before.

1089
01:07:47,544 --> 01:07:50,479
This movie is an unnecessary piece
of naval public relations...

1090
01:07:50,547 --> 01:07:52,811
and I will not risk my life for that.

1091
01:07:53,050 --> 01:07:54,745
You have your orders, Commander.

1092
01:07:54,818 --> 01:07:56,445
I'm not going to do it.

1093
01:07:57,121 --> 01:08:01,387
You will be on that 2100 flight with me,
or I'll put you on charges, Charlie.

1094
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:03,858
Then you just put me on charges, Bus.

1095
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:08,721
Adm. Jessup's office.

1096
01:08:09,166 --> 01:08:10,497
Yes, sir.

1097
01:08:10,968 --> 01:08:13,061
Yes, we'll be there directly, sir.

1098
01:08:13,237 --> 01:08:16,035
They want us
to come to the hotel immediately.

1099
01:08:18,676 --> 01:08:19,700
Sailor!

1100
01:08:20,310 --> 01:08:23,006
Here, take this down
to mimeograph immediately.

1101
01:08:23,247 --> 01:08:26,114
A tomb for the Unknown... Holy cow!

1102
01:08:26,183 --> 01:08:30,552
He's in one of his Annapolis moods.
For heaven's sakes, hold your temper.

1103
01:08:30,654 --> 01:08:32,952
I'm not going to do it, Bus.

1104
01:08:36,126 --> 01:08:38,856
I'm not going to do it, Bus.

1105
01:08:43,100 --> 01:08:44,397
Bus...

1106
01:08:45,502 --> 01:08:46,969
I'm in love.

1107
01:08:47,204 --> 01:08:49,900
I'm in love like I never thought possible.

1108
01:08:50,074 --> 01:08:52,008
Life is especially dear to me right now...

1109
01:08:52,076 --> 01:08:54,636
and I'm not going to leave mine
on some beach in France...

1110
01:08:54,712 --> 01:08:57,840
just to satisfy your grotesque sense
of service loyalty.

1111
01:08:58,348 --> 01:09:02,307
You don't think I'm going to spend
two years in a brig for this.

1112
01:09:02,619 --> 01:09:05,053
I can't believe you're serious, Bus.

1113
01:09:05,489 --> 01:09:08,151
If it's the Navy's public image
that concerns you...

1114
01:09:08,225 --> 01:09:10,921
just think what this will look like
in the newspapers.

1115
01:09:10,994 --> 01:09:13,258
"The first dead man on Omaha Beach."

1116
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:15,798
"The tomb of the Unknown Sailor!"

1117
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:19,460
What a hurricane Drew Pearson
could make out of that.

1118
01:09:19,536 --> 01:09:22,266
You must remember that
small offshore squall he kicked up...

1119
01:09:22,339 --> 01:09:24,899
the time General Patton
slapped that soldier.

1120
01:09:29,446 --> 01:09:31,437
Madison, you're despicable.

1121
01:09:32,149 --> 01:09:34,242
This is insane!

1122
01:09:34,918 --> 01:09:37,045
How did we ever get into this?

1123
01:09:37,821 --> 01:09:40,984
You're not fit to wear
the insignia of a naval officer.

1124
01:09:41,391 --> 01:09:43,655
That was pretty baroque.

1125
01:09:43,727 --> 01:09:47,322
- Wouldn't you say, Marv?
- You're a coward and a scoundrel.

1126
01:09:48,232 --> 01:09:50,564
And if you want to make...

1127
01:09:52,603 --> 01:09:55,333
If you want to make anything out of that...

1128
01:09:55,405 --> 01:09:56,997
I'll be in my room.

1129
01:09:57,775 --> 01:10:01,142
I'll send my seconds
with a choice of weapons!

1130
01:10:06,116 --> 01:10:08,141
Marv, it's your turn.

1131
01:10:08,819 --> 01:10:11,413
Would you like to break my saber
over your knee...

1132
01:10:11,488 --> 01:10:13,251
or snip off my buttons?

1133
01:10:15,092 --> 01:10:17,959
You're not going to expose anything
to Drew Pearson, Charlie.

1134
01:10:18,028 --> 01:10:19,825
You're much too fond of the Admiral.

1135
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:23,991
And you're much too decent to expose
that old man to public ridicule.

1136
01:10:24,134 --> 01:10:27,297
You're gonna have to find a better angle
out of this than that.

1137
01:10:28,305 --> 01:10:31,274
I'm supposed to be on a plane at 9:00
this evening.

1138
01:10:31,341 --> 01:10:35,368
We're meeting with a Port Commander
at Portland at 11:00 this evening.

1139
01:10:35,445 --> 01:10:37,845
That's not much time to think up angles.

1140
01:10:40,851 --> 01:10:42,842
You'll think of something.

1141
01:10:53,597 --> 01:10:56,691
The Admiral would like to see you
in his room, Commander.

1142
01:10:56,767 --> 01:10:58,598
- Is he all right?
- He's fine.

1143
01:11:24,094 --> 01:11:26,289
It seems I cracked up, Charlie.

1144
01:11:27,497 --> 01:11:30,762
That's the price a sane man pays
in this world, sir.

1145
01:11:31,735 --> 01:11:34,135
They say a few days in the hospital...

1146
01:11:36,106 --> 01:11:38,700
I wouldn't mind except that
I'll miss the big show.

1147
01:11:38,775 --> 01:11:41,938
Adm. Kirk asked me to observe
from his flagship.

1148
01:11:42,012 --> 01:11:43,673
Yes, I know, sir.

1149
01:11:44,281 --> 01:11:47,375
It's tonight, you know.
The balloon goes up tonight.

1150
01:11:48,018 --> 01:11:49,918
I expect you've already heard.

1151
01:11:50,287 --> 01:11:53,779
We all knew it was imminent, sir.
We didn't know it was tonight.

1152
01:11:53,924 --> 01:11:55,152
Yep.

1153
01:11:55,225 --> 01:11:58,820
The first boats push off at 2130 hours.

1154
01:12:03,267 --> 01:12:06,668
The first boats push off at 2130 hours, sir?

1155
01:12:06,737 --> 01:12:07,965
Right.

1156
01:12:09,206 --> 01:12:11,037
I've never licked military time, sir.

1157
01:12:11,108 --> 01:12:14,839
2130 hours.
That's 9:30 in the evening, right?

1158
01:12:14,912 --> 01:12:16,140
Right.

1159
01:12:19,983 --> 01:12:22,178
Now that's what I call an angle.

1160
01:12:23,787 --> 01:12:26,779
- Did you say something, Charlie?
- No, sir.

1161
01:12:29,593 --> 01:12:33,290
Now, watch yourself, Charlie.
You'll be cracking up yourself soon.

1162
01:12:47,744 --> 01:12:50,713
Close that door.
Don't turn on those lights.

1163
01:12:50,781 --> 01:12:54,615
- What do you want?
- I don't know how to tell you this.

1164
01:12:55,552 --> 01:12:58,817
I'd like to apologize for
my contemptible behavior before.

1165
01:12:58,889 --> 01:13:00,288
I'd like another chance.

1166
01:13:00,357 --> 01:13:02,188
I've packed my gear.

1167
01:13:02,259 --> 01:13:04,352
We've got a job to do.

1168
01:13:04,428 --> 01:13:05,895
I'm ready to do it.

1169
01:13:06,797 --> 01:13:09,698
Underneath it all, you're a gutsy guy,
aren't you, Charlie?

1170
01:13:09,766 --> 01:13:11,734
I don't know what came over me, Bus.

1171
01:13:11,802 --> 01:13:13,497
I showed the white feather, I suppose.

1172
01:13:13,570 --> 01:13:15,162
Forget about it.

1173
01:13:15,238 --> 01:13:17,206
I know we don't have too much time...

1174
01:13:17,274 --> 01:13:19,708
but could I have leave
to say goodbye to my girl?

1175
01:13:19,776 --> 01:13:24,110
Of course, Charlie. You're making
a big dramatic deal out of this.

1176
01:13:24,181 --> 01:13:26,911
You do have a tendency
to be overly sincere, you know.

1177
01:13:26,984 --> 01:13:28,975
Yes, I guess I do.

1178
01:13:29,052 --> 01:13:31,885
We have seven hours yet.
Take Emily out to lunch.

1179
01:13:31,955 --> 01:13:33,547
Pick me up around 8:00.

1180
01:13:33,623 --> 01:13:37,024
I'll have her assigned to drive us
to the airport. Would you like that?

1181
01:13:37,094 --> 01:13:38,994
- Thanks, Bus.
- Was it raining out?

1182
01:13:39,062 --> 01:13:40,495
Yeah, just started.

1183
01:14:00,650 --> 01:14:02,709
You have a couple of minutes
to say goodbye.

1184
01:14:02,786 --> 01:14:03,946
Thanks, Bus.

1185
01:14:08,258 --> 01:14:09,657
Charlie...

1186
01:14:13,930 --> 01:14:15,056
Write to me.

1187
01:14:15,132 --> 01:14:16,394
Write to you?

1188
01:14:16,466 --> 01:14:19,367
With any luck, I'll be back in London
for lunch tomorrow.

1189
01:14:19,436 --> 01:14:21,495
Look, honey, let me make it clear again.

1190
01:14:21,571 --> 01:14:23,801
I couldn't make this invasion
if I wanted to.

1191
01:14:23,874 --> 01:14:26,001
The demolition engineers
will have shipped out...

1192
01:14:26,076 --> 01:14:28,442
a good two hours before
Bus and I report in.

1193
01:14:28,512 --> 01:14:31,345
The Port Commander's going to look at us
as if we're nuts.

1194
01:14:31,415 --> 01:14:32,905
I'll see you tomorrow.

1195
01:14:32,983 --> 01:14:35,417
It's like you were taking
an overnight business trip.

1196
01:14:35,485 --> 01:14:37,214
That's what it amounts to.

1197
01:14:37,287 --> 01:14:41,053
If I can't book a flight,
I'll catch an afternoon train.

1198
01:14:41,992 --> 01:14:44,517
It's a hell of a D-day, that's all I can say.

1199
01:14:44,594 --> 01:14:47,427
To be honest with you,
there's something very unpleasant...

1200
01:14:47,497 --> 01:14:49,829
about this little deceit
you're pulling on the Navy.

1201
01:14:49,900 --> 01:14:52,835
You've been cackling away all afternoon
as if the invasion...

1202
01:14:52,903 --> 01:14:56,430
in which the fate of nations
and the lives of millions are at stake...

1203
01:14:56,506 --> 01:14:58,940
is nothing more to you than a private joke.

1204
01:14:59,009 --> 01:15:02,376
I just keep thinking of all those men
trooping onto ships tonight...

1205
01:15:02,446 --> 01:15:04,505
wondering if they'll end up
bodies on a beach.

1206
01:15:04,581 --> 01:15:07,846
Honey, I'm not cackling because there are
bodies on a beach tomorrow.

1207
01:15:07,918 --> 01:15:10,284
I'm cackling because
I'm not going to be one of them.

1208
01:15:10,353 --> 01:15:12,514
Honey, we're both getting drenched.

1209
01:15:14,191 --> 01:15:15,317
Charlie!

1210
01:15:19,029 --> 01:15:21,224
I can't marry you.

1211
01:15:21,298 --> 01:15:24,790
I've been waiting for that.
We'll talk about it when I get back.

1212
01:15:24,868 --> 01:15:27,837
I don't want to talk about it.
I don't want to see you again.

1213
01:15:27,904 --> 01:15:31,965
Emily, I will not be brushed off
with my plane about to take off.

1214
01:15:32,042 --> 01:15:34,476
For pity's sake, Charlie,
we both know it's finished.

1215
01:15:34,544 --> 01:15:37,638
Let's end it in one snap
before we say things we'll regret.

1216
01:15:37,747 --> 01:15:40,147
No, let's say them.

1217
01:15:40,217 --> 01:15:42,845
There should be something we regret.

1218
01:15:43,453 --> 01:15:46,889
All right. I despise cowardice...

1219
01:15:47,090 --> 01:15:50,287
I detest selfish people,
and I loathe ruthlessness.

1220
01:15:51,328 --> 01:15:53,728
Since you are cowardly,
selfish, and ruthless...

1221
01:15:53,797 --> 01:15:57,028
I cannot help but despise,
detest, and loathe you.

1222
01:15:57,167 --> 01:16:00,193
That's not the way a woman should feel
about the man she'll marry.

1223
01:16:00,270 --> 01:16:02,830
- Don't be facile, Emily.
- I am not being.

1224
01:16:03,106 --> 01:16:06,872
I've been up all night staring
at your bloody marriage applications!

1225
01:16:08,512 --> 01:16:11,174
I signed them. They're in my purse.

1226
01:16:11,248 --> 01:16:13,148
I was going to give you them
this afternoon...

1227
01:16:13,216 --> 01:16:16,117
but you came prancing in
with this very funny joke...

1228
01:16:16,219 --> 01:16:20,280
you're playing on Bus, the Navy,
your country and the whole bloody world.

1229
01:16:20,624 --> 01:16:25,561
Look, I suppose I'm just a stupid romantic,
but I sort of feel the joke's on me, too.

1230
01:16:25,629 --> 01:16:30,089
I believe in honor, service,
courage, and fair play...

1231
01:16:30,167 --> 01:16:32,795
and cricket, and all the symbols
of the British character...

1232
01:16:32,869 --> 01:16:34,996
which have only civilized half the world.

1233
01:16:35,071 --> 01:16:37,631
You British plundered half the world
for your own profit.

1234
01:16:37,707 --> 01:16:41,302
- It's not the Age of Enlightenment.
- That's an American way of looking at it.

1235
01:16:41,378 --> 01:16:43,744
Don't get into
a "the trouble with you Yanks" thing.

1236
01:16:43,813 --> 01:16:46,748
- It has nothing to do with it.
- It has everything to do with it.

1237
01:16:46,816 --> 01:16:49,876
I'm British,
and you're a bloody fool American.

1238
01:16:49,953 --> 01:16:51,944
I don't want to see you again.

1239
01:16:56,393 --> 01:16:59,851
General Kitchener aside, Emily,
the only thing that's going on here...

1240
01:16:59,930 --> 01:17:02,228
is a woman trying to shake off her lover.

1241
01:17:02,532 --> 01:17:04,432
If you don't love me, say so.

1242
01:17:05,402 --> 01:17:09,338
Nobody gets moral unless they're trying
to get something or get out of something.

1243
01:17:09,406 --> 01:17:13,001
You're trying to get out of marrying me.
If you don't love me, just say so.

1244
01:17:13,076 --> 01:17:15,840
Otherwise, I'll figure
you're just frightened.

1245
01:17:16,012 --> 01:17:18,708
- Frightened of what?
- Frightened of getting married.

1246
01:17:18,782 --> 01:17:20,716
Don't be an ass.

1247
01:17:20,784 --> 01:17:22,547
The weekend passion is over.

1248
01:17:22,619 --> 01:17:26,055
Now it's down to signing applications,
babies, setting up house...

1249
01:17:26,122 --> 01:17:29,319
you have to commit yourself to life now.

1250
01:17:29,392 --> 01:17:31,758
I don't want to know
what's good or bad or true.

1251
01:17:31,828 --> 01:17:33,489
I let God worry about the truth.

1252
01:17:33,563 --> 01:17:36,225
I just want to know
the momentary fact of things.

1253
01:17:36,433 --> 01:17:38,333
Life isn't good or bad or true.

1254
01:17:38,401 --> 01:17:41,768
It's merely factual. It's sensual. It's alive.

1255
01:17:42,005 --> 01:17:45,497
My idea of living sensual facts
are you, a home, a country...

1256
01:17:45,575 --> 01:17:47,839
a world, a universe. In that order.

1257
01:17:49,346 --> 01:17:52,213
I want to know what I am,
not what I should be.

1258
01:17:52,349 --> 01:17:56,581
The fact is, I'm a coward.
I never met anyone who wasn't.

1259
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,051
I'm not.

1260
01:17:58,121 --> 01:18:00,749
You're the most terrified woman
I've ever met.

1261
01:18:00,824 --> 01:18:02,951
You're even scared to get married.

1262
01:18:03,460 --> 01:18:05,325
I've already been married.

1263
01:18:05,528 --> 01:18:08,622
Sure. You married him three days before
he went to Africa.

1264
01:18:08,698 --> 01:18:10,359
Thank God he never came back.

1265
01:18:10,700 --> 01:18:14,136
You're forever falling in love with men
on their last nights of furlough.

1266
01:18:14,204 --> 01:18:17,503
That's the limit of your commitments.
One night, a day, a month!

1267
01:18:17,574 --> 01:18:20,441
You prefer lovers to husbands,
hotels to homes.

1268
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:22,307
You'd rather grieve than live.

1269
01:18:22,479 --> 01:18:26,711
You're not only cowardly and selfish,
you're remarkably cruel as well.

1270
01:18:26,783 --> 01:18:27,772
Come off it.

1271
01:18:27,851 --> 01:18:31,378
The only immoral thing
you have against me is I'm alive.

1272
01:18:35,992 --> 01:18:38,256
I'm going to slap your face, Charlie.

1273
01:18:38,461 --> 01:18:41,021
Go ahead. I won't hit you back.
I'm a coward.

1274
01:18:42,866 --> 01:18:47,132
On the other hand, I'm selfish.
I don't easily give up what's mine.

1275
01:18:47,203 --> 01:18:50,070
You're mine, Emily,
and I'm not going to let you go.

1276
01:18:51,608 --> 01:18:55,100
All you have to say is, "I don't love you."

1277
01:18:56,913 --> 01:18:58,904
I don't love you, Charlie.

1278
01:19:01,084 --> 01:19:04,110
Come on, Charlie! It's time to go!

1279
01:19:05,255 --> 01:19:07,155
Well, you're a good woman.

1280
01:19:07,223 --> 01:19:09,714
You've done the morally right thing.

1281
01:19:09,793 --> 01:19:13,229
God save us all from people
who do the morally right thing.

1282
01:19:13,296 --> 01:19:16,527
It's the rest of us who get broken in half.

1283
01:19:16,599 --> 01:19:18,089
You're a bitch.

1284
01:19:23,540 --> 01:19:27,169
I want you to remember
that the last time you saw me...

1285
01:19:29,446 --> 01:19:32,745
I was unregenerately eating a Hershey bar.

1286
01:19:48,498 --> 01:19:51,092
- What the hell is this all about?
- Sir?

1287
01:19:51,167 --> 01:19:54,261
What is this,
some featherheaded gag, Commander?

1288
01:19:54,738 --> 01:19:57,502
The demolition units sailed two hours ago.

1289
01:19:59,476 --> 01:20:03,572
You featherheads in London,
all you want to do is make movies.

1290
01:20:03,980 --> 01:20:08,110
Who's running this featherheaded war?
Ginger Rogers?

1291
01:20:09,018 --> 01:20:12,454
The demolition units are halfway across
the English Channel.

1292
01:20:12,522 --> 01:20:15,116
The invasion started two hours ago.

1293
01:20:17,227 --> 01:20:18,956
Heavens. Movies.

1294
01:20:20,597 --> 01:20:24,294
All right, Edwards,
hide these Hollywood people...

1295
01:20:24,367 --> 01:20:27,768
somewhere where they're out
of my featherheading way.

1296
01:20:29,706 --> 01:20:31,469
But, sir, we didn't know.

1297
01:20:31,541 --> 01:20:34,203
We'll have to put you up
in one of the supply depots, sir.

1298
01:20:34,277 --> 01:20:36,711
It's D-day, Charlie. Tonight's D-day.

1299
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:39,214
Can't you get that through your head?

1300
01:20:41,017 --> 01:20:44,418
Looks like the featherheading balloon
just went up without us.

1301
01:20:44,487 --> 01:20:46,955
Boatswain, take these officers to a depot...

1302
01:20:47,023 --> 01:20:49,321
and find some cots for them.

1303
01:21:15,518 --> 01:21:17,577
How's the invasion going, boatswain?

1304
01:21:17,654 --> 01:21:19,747
They called it off, sir. Didn't you know?

1305
01:21:19,823 --> 01:21:21,688
What do you mean, they called it off?

1306
01:21:21,758 --> 01:21:24,921
The visibility never cleared up enough
for the airborne troops.

1307
01:21:24,994 --> 01:21:27,986
The whole fleet turned around
in mid-channel and came back.

1308
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:30,726
Looks as if we got to do
the whole thing again tonight.

1309
01:21:30,800 --> 01:21:33,769
What do you mean
the fleet turned around in the Channel?

1310
01:21:33,903 --> 01:21:37,600
What do you mean,
we got to do it all over again tonight?

1311
01:21:58,361 --> 01:22:00,386
Get your pants on, Mac.

1312
01:22:00,463 --> 01:22:02,226
Hey, Charlie!

1313
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:06,060
- I've got one camera, anyway.
- What happened?

1314
01:22:06,135 --> 01:22:09,263
- What do you mean, what happened?
- What do you think I mean?

1315
01:22:09,339 --> 01:22:12,467
You mean to tell me that 5,000 boats
filled with 1,000,000 men...

1316
01:22:12,542 --> 01:22:15,841
tanks, airplanes, bombers,
the whole sphere, just turned around...

1317
01:22:15,912 --> 01:22:18,938
- in the middle of the ocean and came back.
- Moon didn't come out.

1318
01:22:19,015 --> 01:22:20,846
What do you mean, the moon...

1319
01:22:22,018 --> 01:22:26,045
The moon didn't come out?
How could you do this to me?

1320
01:22:26,122 --> 01:22:28,613
Mac, you get some clothes on.

1321
01:22:42,438 --> 01:22:44,906
- Commander Madison?
- Yeah.

1322
01:22:46,743 --> 01:22:48,836
I was told to report to you, Sir.

1323
01:22:48,978 --> 01:22:50,946
- What for?
- I don't know.

1324
01:22:51,014 --> 01:22:53,778
Lt. Cmdr. Cummings,
he comes in the galley...

1325
01:22:53,850 --> 01:22:56,978
and he says, "Anybody here know
anything about cameras?"

1326
01:22:57,053 --> 01:22:59,248
I say, "Sure, I've made
a lot of home movies."

1327
01:22:59,322 --> 01:23:02,223
He says, "Okay, you report
to Cmdr. Madison...

1328
01:23:02,292 --> 01:23:04,226
"Squad Room 6, naval engineers."

1329
01:23:04,294 --> 01:23:05,318
Yeah.

1330
01:23:06,062 --> 01:23:09,327
- Yeah, what?
- Yeah, that's what happened to me.

1331
01:23:11,434 --> 01:23:13,595
What's this all about, Commander?

1332
01:23:14,571 --> 01:23:16,664
If I told you, you'd rap me in the mouth.

1333
01:23:16,739 --> 01:23:20,641
- Here, you men better have a drink of this.
- Yes, sir.

1334
01:23:27,083 --> 01:23:30,018
Commander, we're running
a little low here.

1335
01:23:33,656 --> 01:23:35,556
Men, this is the deal.

1336
01:23:37,660 --> 01:23:41,756
At 1700, we get ferried out to an LST...

1337
01:23:41,831 --> 01:23:45,358
to join the six naval engineers
who are already on board.

1338
01:23:45,668 --> 01:23:49,229
At 2000 hours, we shove off.

1339
01:23:51,207 --> 01:23:54,335
At 0500, tomorrow morning...

1340
01:23:54,410 --> 01:23:56,776
we transfer into an LCVP...

1341
01:23:57,880 --> 01:23:59,472
with the engineers.

1342
01:23:59,749 --> 01:24:03,515
We'll be about 3,000 yards
off Omaha beach.

1343
01:24:04,220 --> 01:24:06,450
We start moving toward the beach...

1344
01:24:06,522 --> 01:24:09,320
until we get to the minefields
and barricades.

1345
01:24:09,392 --> 01:24:12,259
Then the engineers get into the water...

1346
01:24:12,328 --> 01:24:16,355
and start clearing out those minefields
and those barricades.

1347
01:24:17,667 --> 01:24:19,965
We get into the water with them.

1348
01:24:21,871 --> 01:24:23,304
What for?

1349
01:24:23,806 --> 01:24:26,001
We're going to make movies.

1350
01:24:26,075 --> 01:24:28,669
We're going to shoot movies
of those engineers...

1351
01:24:28,745 --> 01:24:33,148
clearing out those minefields
and barricades all the way to the beach.

1352
01:24:34,117 --> 01:24:37,951
Mostly we want to shoot movies
of engineers getting killed...

1353
01:24:38,554 --> 01:24:42,547
especially the first body
that washes up on Omaha beach.

1354
01:24:44,627 --> 01:24:48,063
That's the deal.
What do you think of that, mates?

1355
01:24:48,765 --> 01:24:51,893
Commander, I think you're out
of your ever-loving mind.

1356
01:24:52,301 --> 01:24:54,201
You can say that again.

1357
01:24:54,270 --> 01:24:56,067
What's this?

1358
01:24:56,406 --> 01:24:58,203
That's a camera.

1359
01:24:58,307 --> 01:25:00,104
How do you work it?

1360
01:25:00,176 --> 01:25:02,076
How the hell do I know?

1361
01:25:02,145 --> 01:25:04,579
This is a pretty intricate camera.

1362
01:25:04,647 --> 01:25:08,549
At home I got a little old
8 mm Bell and Howell.

1363
01:25:08,618 --> 01:25:10,586
I never saw anything like this before.

1364
01:25:10,653 --> 01:25:13,315
That's what they gave me.

1365
01:25:14,757 --> 01:25:16,657
I can see the ceiling.

1366
01:25:21,731 --> 01:25:24,359
I'll tell you one thing.

1367
01:25:24,901 --> 01:25:27,426
You got to put film in this camera.

1368
01:25:29,706 --> 01:25:31,435
Are you sure of that?

1369
01:25:32,442 --> 01:25:35,206
For the love of Mike,
what's the matter with you?

1370
01:25:35,278 --> 01:25:38,736
If you're going to make a movie,
you got to put film in the camera.

1371
01:25:38,815 --> 01:25:40,009
Even I know that.

1372
01:25:40,083 --> 01:25:43,211
No. We're going to make this movie
without film.

1373
01:25:44,053 --> 01:25:48,752
This movie, sailor, cannot be made.
There's no reason it for being made.

1374
01:25:48,825 --> 01:25:53,285
None of us know how to make a movie.
So what is the sense in using film?

1375
01:25:53,362 --> 01:25:54,761
Makes sense.

1376
01:25:54,831 --> 01:25:56,526
I'm cutting out of here.

1377
01:25:59,268 --> 01:26:00,792
Hey, Commander?

1378
01:26:01,771 --> 01:26:04,467
Do you see that little kid on the floor?

1379
01:26:05,641 --> 01:26:10,476
Well, him and me, we've been stoned
for two days.

1380
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:14,982
We started off with
three bottles of vanilla extract...

1381
01:26:15,384 --> 01:26:18,649
and then we got in with
a bunch of submarine fellas...

1382
01:26:18,721 --> 01:26:22,953
and we finished off
a Number 10 can of torpedo alcohol.

1383
01:26:26,162 --> 01:26:28,494
You got to be pretty stoned
after that, right?

1384
01:26:28,564 --> 01:26:30,225
I would think so.

1385
01:26:30,299 --> 01:26:32,426
Commander, we ain't that stoned.

1386
01:26:33,202 --> 01:26:36,660
We're not that stoned
that we're going to go the beach...

1387
01:26:36,739 --> 01:26:39,640
and take any pictures of
the dead bodies floating in...

1388
01:26:39,709 --> 01:26:41,233
with no film in the camera.

1389
01:26:41,310 --> 01:26:45,303
Then what do you say
we just don't make this movie?

1390
01:26:45,381 --> 01:26:46,746
Ain't that swell?

1391
01:26:48,484 --> 01:26:50,475
All right, men, up and at 'em.

1392
01:26:54,290 --> 01:26:57,817
You're crocked. You're all crocked.

1393
01:26:57,894 --> 01:27:00,385
Madison, get this man on his feet.

1394
01:27:00,463 --> 01:27:02,897
Hold on now, he just fell over on...

1395
01:27:02,999 --> 01:27:05,160
Now, you listen to me.

1396
01:27:05,234 --> 01:27:08,670
Get into these clothes
and get into them fast...

1397
01:27:08,771 --> 01:27:11,501
or so help me, I'll have you all shot.

1398
01:27:11,808 --> 01:27:14,470
Stand up in the presence of an officer.

1399
01:27:14,544 --> 01:27:17,035
How am I going to get you drunks
on board that LST?

1400
01:27:22,185 --> 01:27:24,153
How's the weather up there, sailor?

1401
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:26,245
Why don't you guys go to France?

1402
01:27:39,836 --> 01:27:43,067
Help me out. Thank you.

1403
01:27:54,984 --> 01:27:58,511
<i>- Now hear this...</i>
- How many days we've been on this tub?

1404
01:27:58,588 --> 01:28:02,285
- We already heard it!
- At ease, gentlemen.

1405
01:28:02,959 --> 01:28:04,950
All right, Charlie, here's your camera.

1406
01:28:05,027 --> 01:28:07,257
I'll be back in a minute
with your battery pack.

1407
01:28:07,330 --> 01:28:09,321
<i>You are about to embark</i>
<i>on a great crusade...</i>

1408
01:28:09,398 --> 01:28:12,026
<i>toward which we have striven</i>
<i>these many months.</i>

1409
01:28:12,735 --> 01:28:15,863

1410
01:28:15,938 --> 01:28:17,701

1411
01:28:17,773 --> 01:28:18,831
Can it!

1412
01:28:18,908 --> 01:28:21,706
Lieutenant, can't you
keep your men quiet?

1413
01:28:21,777 --> 01:28:23,574
All right, you men, shut up!

1414
01:28:23,813 --> 01:28:26,748
You already read us
about the great crusade.

1415
01:28:26,816 --> 01:28:29,979
I know. Now he's reading it. So shut up.

1416
01:28:30,519 --> 01:28:32,316
<i>All right, now hear this.</i>

1417
01:28:32,388 --> 01:28:35,551
<i>The hopes and prayers of</i>
<i>liberty-loving people everywhere...</i>

1418
01:28:35,625 --> 01:28:37,183
I'm gonna be sick.

1419
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:39,387
<i>Accompanied with our brave allies...</i>

1420
01:28:39,462 --> 01:28:42,022
<i>brothers in arms on other fronts...</i>

1421
01:28:42,098 --> 01:28:46,125
<i>you are bringing about the destruction</i>
<i>of the German war machine...</i>

1422
01:28:46,435 --> 01:28:50,565
<i>the elimination of Nazi tyranny</i>
<i>over the oppressed peoples of Europe...</i>

1423
01:28:51,841 --> 01:28:55,299
<i>and security for ourselves in a free world.</i>

1424
01:29:09,191 --> 01:29:11,887
Cmdr. Cummings wants us
on the bridge, sir.

1425
01:29:12,895 --> 01:29:14,692
Where the hell are we, sailor?

1426
01:29:14,764 --> 01:29:19,360
About five miles off the coast of France.
You better get up on the bridge, sir.

1427
01:29:26,909 --> 01:29:28,001
Yes?

1428
01:29:28,611 --> 01:29:30,442
Charlie, come in. Close the door.

1429
01:29:30,513 --> 01:29:31,639
Got a real break.

1430
01:29:31,714 --> 01:29:33,875
There's a Navy camera unit assigned
to the ship.

1431
01:29:33,950 --> 01:29:37,579
This is photographer's mate Enright.
He'll show us how these cameras work.

1432
01:29:37,653 --> 01:29:40,884
- Go ahead, sailor.
- I don't quite understand your assignment.

1433
01:29:40,957 --> 01:29:42,686
Let me see if I can get this straight.

1434
01:29:42,858 --> 01:29:46,419
You're going to get in the water
at the same time as the engineers?

1435
01:29:46,495 --> 01:29:49,259
As I understand, sir,
that's four feet of water.

1436
01:29:49,398 --> 01:29:52,959
Pretty rough sea, sir.
You'll be lucky if you can keep your feet.

1437
01:29:53,336 --> 01:29:55,133
These cameras are heavy.

1438
01:29:55,204 --> 01:29:56,933
I've got a suggestion, sir.

1439
01:29:57,006 --> 01:30:00,407
You and your men stay in the LCVP
with our crew. It'll be pretty bouncy...

1440
01:30:00,476 --> 01:30:02,273
but your camera will be steady.

1441
01:30:02,345 --> 01:30:05,678
We want to be on the beach
with the very first men. Don't we, Charlie?

1442
01:30:05,748 --> 01:30:08,012
My helmet's off to you, gentlemen.

1443
01:30:08,150 --> 01:30:11,278
I guess I better get some gelatin
and waterproof those cameras.

1444
01:30:11,354 --> 01:30:14,380
We'll be down in the water room
getting a bite to eat.

1445
01:30:15,291 --> 01:30:17,987
Men, before we go down to eat,
I want to read you...

1446
01:30:18,060 --> 01:30:20,528
a message from our supreme commander.

1447
01:30:20,730 --> 01:30:24,564
"Soldiers, sailors, airmen
of the Allied Expeditionary Force...

1448
01:30:25,601 --> 01:30:28,661
"you are about to embark
on a great crusade...

1449
01:30:28,738 --> 01:30:31,502
"toward which we have striven
these many months.

1450
01:30:31,574 --> 01:30:35,066
"The hopes and prayers of liberty-loving
people everywhere go with you."

1451
01:30:49,925 --> 01:30:53,053
All right, sergeants, line them up.
Come on.

1452
01:30:53,629 --> 01:30:56,530
<i>Now hear this...</i>

1453
01:31:01,904 --> 01:31:04,600
Point the camera in the direction
you want to shoot...

1454
01:31:04,673 --> 01:31:07,403
- and press this switch over here.
- What about this one here?

1455
01:31:07,476 --> 01:31:11,207
First you got to turn this one on.
Charlie, you're not paying attention.

1456
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:12,304
Let's go.

1457
01:31:12,381 --> 01:31:15,043
All right, men, into the trucks. Let's go.

1458
01:31:18,054 --> 01:31:20,454
Lower the boats, damn it!

1459
01:31:22,258 --> 01:31:26,217
Okay, first demolition team over the side!
Let's go.

1460
01:31:34,036 --> 01:31:36,834
- Where's the kid?
- He's too sick, sir.

1461
01:31:36,906 --> 01:31:39,136
All right, Charlie, this is it.

1462
01:31:44,213 --> 01:31:45,737
<i>All right, First Division.</i>

1463
01:31:45,981 --> 01:31:48,245
Easy with the camera now, Charlie.

1464
01:31:51,053 --> 01:31:52,884
Okay.

1465
01:31:54,757 --> 01:31:56,486
You're up next, sailor.

1466
01:32:58,053 --> 01:33:01,989
- How much further on, Ensign?
- Maybe 5,000, maybe 6,000 feet.

1467
01:33:02,124 --> 01:33:04,490
Should see the low-water mark any time.

1468
01:33:05,528 --> 01:33:08,156
5,000-6,000 feet out, Charlie.

1469
01:33:41,564 --> 01:33:44,533
There's the low-water mark.
Stand by to load the raft.

1470
01:33:48,337 --> 01:33:50,532
They're shooting at us. Lower the raft.

1471
01:33:50,606 --> 01:33:52,540
This is it, Charlie. Let's go.

1472
01:33:52,608 --> 01:33:53,700
- I'm cold.
- Let's go.

1473
01:34:31,580 --> 01:34:34,572
No, the other way! The beach is that way!

1474
01:34:34,650 --> 01:34:37,585
I know which way the beach is!
What's the matter with you?

1475
01:34:37,653 --> 01:34:40,315
You yellow rat, go to that beach.

1476
01:34:40,389 --> 01:34:42,823
What's the matter with you?
They're shooting at us!

1477
01:34:42,891 --> 01:34:45,655
Take pictures!

1478
01:34:45,894 --> 01:34:46,883
What?

1479
01:35:53,629 --> 01:35:58,123
He's the first dead man on Omaha Beach
if that means anything, Commander.

1480
01:36:26,895 --> 01:36:27,884
Emily...

1481
01:36:29,398 --> 01:36:32,231
Cmdr. Cummings is here to condole again.

1482
01:36:34,703 --> 01:36:37,171
Mother, I can't very well be condoled with.

1483
01:36:37,239 --> 01:36:39,764
I'm still pretending Charlie's alive.

1484
01:36:40,376 --> 01:36:42,867
As long as you know it's still pretending.

1485
01:36:42,945 --> 01:36:46,472
I do think, Emily, we've had enough
of this sinister withdrawal of yours.

1486
01:36:46,548 --> 01:36:49,711
It's eight days since you went off
into this medieval retreat.

1487
01:36:49,785 --> 01:36:53,277
You know, you're doing just what I did,
and you'll end just as dotty.

1488
01:36:53,355 --> 01:36:56,654
I promise you,
there's very little satisfaction in it.

1489
01:37:06,301 --> 01:37:09,896
Absolutely wooden with grief.
Sends her best but asks to be excused.

1490
01:37:09,972 --> 01:37:13,339
Yes, of course, I understand.
I just stopped by to show her this.

1491
01:37:13,409 --> 01:37:16,867
Thought it might make her feel better.
It's yesterday's <i>New York Globe.</i>

1492
01:37:16,945 --> 01:37:19,709
I'm onto that.
What did you want me to see?

1493
01:37:19,782 --> 01:37:21,977
The photograph, ma'am.
It's Charlie Madison...

1494
01:37:22,050 --> 01:37:23,779
the first American on Omaha Beach.

1495
01:37:23,852 --> 01:37:25,820
It's on the front page
of the <i>New York Globe.</i>

1496
01:37:25,888 --> 01:37:29,483
It can't be said to be a very good likeness.
It's mostly his back, isn't it?

1497
01:37:29,558 --> 01:37:33,756
This photograph was on the front page
of almost 200 papers in the US alone.

1498
01:37:33,829 --> 01:37:36,195
We honestly didn't think
it would catch on that big.

1499
01:37:36,265 --> 01:37:39,428
Our press office people just sent it out
as a standard release...

1500
01:37:39,501 --> 01:37:41,298
and first thing we knew it was...

1501
01:37:41,370 --> 01:37:44,828
Mrs. Barham, this picture was in almost
every London newspaper yesterday.

1502
01:37:44,907 --> 01:37:47,137
- I was sure you'd seen it.
- No.

1503
01:37:48,076 --> 01:37:52,069
Charlie's a hero, ma'am.
Our public relations office is talking now...

1504
01:37:52,147 --> 01:37:55,014
of holding some sort of ceremony
over his grave...

1505
01:37:55,083 --> 01:37:57,415
building some sort of monument.

1506
01:37:57,486 --> 01:37:58,578
A monument?

1507
01:37:58,654 --> 01:38:00,986
Probably nothing more
than a simple bronze plaque...

1508
01:38:01,056 --> 01:38:03,183
but the French have indicated
they'd be willing...

1509
01:38:03,258 --> 01:38:05,556
to declare Charlie's grave
a French national shrine.

1510
01:38:05,761 --> 01:38:07,353
That's depraved.

1511
01:38:07,463 --> 01:38:10,296
As soon as I get an extra copy of <i>Life</i>
I'll bring it to you.

1512
01:38:10,365 --> 01:38:11,923
What on earth for?

1513
01:38:12,734 --> 01:38:16,397
This picture of Charlie
is on the front cover of <i>Life</i> magazine.

1514
01:38:16,472 --> 01:38:17,939
That's shoddy.

1515
01:38:18,273 --> 01:38:19,968
A French national monument.

1516
01:38:20,042 --> 01:38:22,875
I suppose one must expect
that sort of thing from the French.

1517
01:38:22,945 --> 01:38:24,537
But you're supposed to be his friend.

1518
01:38:24,613 --> 01:38:28,413
Couldn't you've done something to keep
this sordid business out of the press?

1519
01:38:28,517 --> 01:38:30,542
We're all very disappointed in Charlie...

1520
01:38:30,652 --> 01:38:33,348
but he's paid his price,
and there's no need to rake it up.

1521
01:38:33,489 --> 01:38:36,925
I don't think you have this exactly right.
Charlie's a hero.

1522
01:38:37,125 --> 01:38:38,114
Mother?

1523
01:38:38,193 --> 01:38:40,821
There she is. Now don't say a word to her.

1524
01:38:40,896 --> 01:38:43,524
I'll tell her when I think she's well enough.

1525
01:38:48,136 --> 01:38:50,001
Going to work?
That's very sensible of you.

1526
01:38:50,072 --> 01:38:52,199
I don't know how
you've put up with me this long.

1527
01:38:52,274 --> 01:38:54,640
Don't forget that man's still here
to commiserate.

1528
01:38:54,710 --> 01:38:56,371
This is his third condolence visit...

1529
01:38:56,445 --> 01:38:59,539
and he's going to say comforting things.
So you'll be polite to him?

1530
01:38:59,615 --> 01:39:02,880
- He's just a bit sincere.
- I must say I find him grotesque.

1531
01:39:10,359 --> 01:39:12,919
Yes. Emily, you're doing the right thing.

1532
01:39:12,995 --> 01:39:16,396
Bury yourself in work.
We've all got to keep going.

1533
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,563
Emily, I must warn you,
Charlie's picture is in all the papers.

1534
01:39:21,637 --> 01:39:23,764
They're going to put up a monument
on his grave.

1535
01:39:23,839 --> 01:39:26,501
What on earth for? All he did was die.

1536
01:39:28,443 --> 01:39:32,243
Dear me, we should be celebrating cancer
and automobile smashups next.

1537
01:39:32,314 --> 01:39:34,908
He didn't just die. He sacrificed his life.

1538
01:39:34,983 --> 01:39:36,473
That was very pagan of him.

1539
01:39:36,552 --> 01:39:39,715
He was the first American
to die on Omaha Beach.

1540
01:39:39,788 --> 01:39:41,688
Was there a contest?

1541
01:39:41,757 --> 01:39:44,954
Emily, why, I don't understand you.

1542
01:39:45,027 --> 01:39:47,188
I thought you'd be proud.

1543
01:39:49,064 --> 01:39:51,931
You might as well burn this
along with yesterday's <i>Daily Mail...</i>

1544
01:39:52,000 --> 01:39:53,695
which I fished out of the garden fire.

1545
01:39:53,769 --> 01:39:56,738
We no longer take pride
in death in this house, Bus.

1546
01:39:57,072 --> 01:40:00,337
What was admirable about Charlie
was his sensation of life...

1547
01:40:00,409 --> 01:40:03,901
his cowardly, selfish,
greedy appreciation of life...

1548
01:40:04,146 --> 01:40:06,910
unadorned and uncertain as it is.

1549
01:40:07,015 --> 01:40:08,482
I loved him very much.

1550
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:10,745
I don't think I shall
ever love anyone as much...

1551
01:40:10,819 --> 01:40:12,309
but I shall try.

1552
01:40:13,722 --> 01:40:16,282
Are you going back
to the Navy building, Bus?

1553
01:40:16,992 --> 01:40:20,553
No, I have to stop by the hospital to pick
the Admiral up.

1554
01:40:20,629 --> 01:40:24,030
Drop me at the Edgware Road.
I'll take a bus from there.

1555
01:40:24,099 --> 01:40:28,160
I thought I saw her peering at me
when I was burning those papers.

1556
01:40:34,610 --> 01:40:36,407
I was damn fond of Charlie.

1557
01:40:37,346 --> 01:40:41,009
He's one of the few really decent
human beings I've ever known...

1558
01:40:41,083 --> 01:40:43,916
aside from being the best dog-robber
in the world.

1559
01:40:44,252 --> 01:40:47,244
What the hell was Charlie
doing on Omaha Beach anyway?

1560
01:40:47,322 --> 01:40:48,414
Sir?

1561
01:40:48,490 --> 01:40:51,926
What exactly was this movie
Charlie was making on Omaha Beach?

1562
01:40:51,994 --> 01:40:54,588
What was Charlie doing
making a movie in the first place?

1563
01:40:54,663 --> 01:40:56,494
He was making your movie, sir.

1564
01:40:56,565 --> 01:41:00,729
Yeah, you keep saying it was my movie.
What do you mean, my movie?

1565
01:41:00,836 --> 01:41:03,703
The movie you wanted made
about the demolition engineers.

1566
01:41:03,772 --> 01:41:05,364
I don't remember a...

1567
01:41:06,074 --> 01:41:07,666
Oh my God, Bus.

1568
01:41:08,777 --> 01:41:12,269
Was this some idea I conceived...

1569
01:41:13,081 --> 01:41:14,708
when I was cracking up?

1570
01:41:16,151 --> 01:41:18,517
And you went ahead and made it?

1571
01:41:18,920 --> 01:41:21,616
But I was unbalanced at the time.

1572
01:41:21,690 --> 01:41:26,024
I wasn't responsible.
You mean that Charlie Madison...

1573
01:41:28,830 --> 01:41:30,422
Oh, my God.

1574
01:41:33,602 --> 01:41:36,833
Sir, we wanted a hero. Now we've got one.

1575
01:41:38,006 --> 01:41:41,464
You don't send a man to his death
because you want a hero.

1576
01:41:42,778 --> 01:41:44,803
The whole purpose
of our coming over here was...

1577
01:41:44,880 --> 01:41:48,907
to try to find something to catch the eye
of the Committee on Military Affairs.

1578
01:41:48,984 --> 01:41:52,078
Remind them that the Navy is still
an essential service.

1579
01:41:52,287 --> 01:41:55,450
We're trying to keep
from being scrapped, sir.

1580
01:41:57,259 --> 01:42:00,228
May God forgive me.
I'll never forgive myself.

1581
01:42:03,165 --> 01:42:07,124
If you want to catch the eye of
the Joint Committee on Military Affairs...

1582
01:42:07,202 --> 01:42:10,535
you'll have to bury Charlie in Washington
not on Omaha Beach.

1583
01:42:10,605 --> 01:42:13,039
Right in the middle
of the Senate committee room...

1584
01:42:13,108 --> 01:42:16,168
and certainly no farther away
than Pennsylvania Avenue.

1585
01:42:16,278 --> 01:42:20,214
I will not authorize funds
for any monument on Omaha Beach.

1586
01:42:20,282 --> 01:42:22,546
We need something more immediate.
Give me my jacket.

1587
01:42:22,617 --> 01:42:23,641
Yes, sir.

1588
01:42:23,752 --> 01:42:25,481
- You got my flight orders?
- Yes, sir.

1589
01:42:25,587 --> 01:42:29,785
You leave for Washington tonight
with Marv Ellender on the 2200 flight.

1590
01:42:32,627 --> 01:42:35,221
The only solace for any of us is that...

1591
01:42:35,964 --> 01:42:38,660
if Charlie were here,
he'd be laughing himself silly.

1592
01:42:46,408 --> 01:42:48,899
All ambulatory patients over here.

1593
01:42:48,977 --> 01:42:52,572
You are now at the Sixth Medical
Relocation Center in Southampton.

1594
01:42:52,647 --> 01:42:55,980
You'll all be properly taken care of
in a few minutes.

1595
01:42:56,051 --> 01:42:58,918
All those who need immediate attention,
right here.

1596
01:42:59,421 --> 01:43:01,685
Magazines, newspapers.

1597
01:43:02,891 --> 01:43:04,290
Any of you want some magazines?

1598
01:43:04,359 --> 01:43:08,022
Here you go.
Do you want some magazines?

1599
01:43:09,064 --> 01:43:11,055
<i>Life, Newsweek?</i>

1600
01:43:11,533 --> 01:43:12,795
Do you want a copy of <i>Life?</i>

1601
01:43:12,868 --> 01:43:15,234
No, thank you. I've seen it already.

1602
01:43:23,311 --> 01:43:24,903
You and Adams lock up the shop.

1603
01:43:24,980 --> 01:43:27,210
I want you both in Washington
by Wednesday night.

1604
01:43:27,382 --> 01:43:30,647
- And forget about that tomb.
- Yes, sir.

1605
01:43:31,052 --> 01:43:34,044
Admirals Corning and Ridgeway
are supposed to testify on Thursday.

1606
01:43:34,122 --> 01:43:36,113
I don't think they'll get to us
before Monday.

1607
01:43:36,391 --> 01:43:40,054
- Bus, can I see you a minute?
- Is something the matter?

1608
01:43:40,428 --> 01:43:42,988
I think you could say
something's the matter.

1609
01:43:43,331 --> 01:43:46,391
I just got a call from the
Sixth Relocation Center in Southampton.

1610
01:43:46,468 --> 01:43:48,834
That's where they bring
the casualties from France.

1611
01:43:48,904 --> 01:43:50,997
They've got
a Lt. Cmdr. Charles E. Madison...

1612
01:43:51,072 --> 01:43:52,596
ready to be released.

1613
01:43:52,674 --> 01:43:56,303
Would we arrange transportation
for him and bring him a uniform?

1614
01:43:56,778 --> 01:43:59,372
I don't know whether to laugh or to cry.

1615
01:43:59,481 --> 01:44:02,279
- I don't know if you heard me.
- I heard you. I don't get it.

1616
01:44:02,350 --> 01:44:05,842
- I spoke to him. He's alive.
- He's practically a French national shrine.

1617
01:44:05,921 --> 01:44:07,115
How the hell can he be alive?

1618
01:44:07,189 --> 01:44:09,885
He got on the phone. Said, "Hi, Paul."
I said, "Hi, Charlie."

1619
01:44:09,958 --> 01:44:13,655
He said, "Paul, do me a favor,
call Miss Barham and tell her I'm okay."

1620
01:44:13,728 --> 01:44:14,854
I saw him with my own eyes.

1621
01:44:14,930 --> 01:44:17,421
He also said, "Tell Bus
if I ever lay my hands on him...

1622
01:44:17,499 --> 01:44:19,967
"I'm going to belt him
in his big fat stern sheets."

1623
01:44:20,135 --> 01:44:21,625
He's alive.

1624
01:44:22,437 --> 01:44:25,270
The first dead man
on Omaha Beach is alive.

1625
01:44:27,509 --> 01:44:29,306
Boy, that's great.

1626
01:44:29,377 --> 01:44:32,540
200 newspapers in the US alone,
the front cover of <i>Life</i> magazine...

1627
01:44:32,614 --> 01:44:34,548
every newsreel in the world,
and he's alive.

1628
01:44:34,616 --> 01:44:38,313
- What's he mad at you for?
- Not only is he alive, he's a coward.

1629
01:44:38,386 --> 01:44:41,184
We had a nice dead hero.
Now we got a lousy live coward.

1630
01:44:41,256 --> 01:44:43,053
- What's wrong?
- This better not be a gag!

1631
01:44:43,124 --> 01:44:44,523
It's no gag.

1632
01:44:45,827 --> 01:44:47,761
Admiral!

1633
01:44:49,164 --> 01:44:51,223
Sir, he's alive, damn it.

1634
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:54,034
Alive? Madison?

1635
01:44:54,102 --> 01:44:55,194
Yes, sir.

1636
01:44:55,270 --> 01:44:59,366
In a relocation center in Southampton
waiting to be released right now, sir.

1637
01:44:59,808 --> 01:45:01,241
Thank God.

1638
01:45:01,309 --> 01:45:04,301
That's wonderful, Bus. Wonderful!

1639
01:45:06,948 --> 01:45:11,317
Now we can bring your
first man on Omaha Beach...

1640
01:45:11,386 --> 01:45:15,550
right into Room 610
of the Senate office building.

1641
01:45:15,991 --> 01:45:16,980
Sir?

1642
01:45:17,058 --> 01:45:20,619
I want Madison flown to Washington
on the first plane out of Southampton.

1643
01:45:20,695 --> 01:45:22,993
I want him flown
to Washington tomorrow.

1644
01:45:23,064 --> 01:45:25,692
We're going to give Charlie a parade...

1645
01:45:25,767 --> 01:45:28,099
right down Pennsylvania Avenue...

1646
01:45:28,169 --> 01:45:30,103
and to the front lawn of the White House...

1647
01:45:30,171 --> 01:45:34,301
where the President himself
will decorate Charlie with a Navy Cross.

1648
01:45:34,843 --> 01:45:37,869
I'm not so sure we should involve
the President in this, sir.

1649
01:45:37,946 --> 01:45:39,777
The President's an old Navy man.

1650
01:45:39,848 --> 01:45:41,839
He's sympathetic to
our position throughout.

1651
01:45:42,050 --> 01:45:45,019
Yes, sir, but I just don't think
we should go that big.

1652
01:45:45,086 --> 01:45:46,212
Big?

1653
01:45:47,756 --> 01:45:51,852
We're going to make a brass-band hero
out of Charlie...

1654
01:45:51,927 --> 01:45:54,088
using every coarse theatricality...

1655
01:45:54,162 --> 01:45:57,620
the public relations office
is overpaid to think up.

1656
01:45:57,699 --> 01:46:02,363
When I walk into that Senate office
hearing on Monday or Tuesday...

1657
01:46:02,470 --> 01:46:06,463
I'll smile my crisp military smile
at all those senators...

1658
01:46:06,675 --> 01:46:10,406
and then, in a perfunctory way,
I'll introduce my two aides:

1659
01:46:10,612 --> 01:46:13,376
Capt. Ellender here, my technical advisor...

1660
01:46:13,448 --> 01:46:16,212
and Lt. Cmdr. Charles. E. Madison.

1661
01:46:16,284 --> 01:46:21,278
Gentlemen, the first American
on Omaha Beach. A sailor.

1662
01:46:21,856 --> 01:46:25,792
That, Bus, is what is known
as letting them have it in spades.

1663
01:46:26,161 --> 01:46:28,595
Doubled, redoubled, and vulnerable.

1664
01:46:31,700 --> 01:46:34,601
Sir, I'd better really tell you
what happened on D-day.

1665
01:46:34,669 --> 01:46:38,002
Is he alive? Is that what you're saying,
that he's alive?

1666
01:46:38,673 --> 01:46:41,039
Yes, Miss Barham, we think he is.

1667
01:46:42,344 --> 01:46:43,777
Oh, dear.

1668
01:46:48,083 --> 01:46:52,383
Miss Barham, we're almost as happy
about this as you are.

1669
01:46:53,254 --> 01:46:54,744
Thank you, sir.

1670
01:46:54,990 --> 01:46:59,086
Bus, I want you to drive this young lady
down to Southampton...

1671
01:46:59,160 --> 01:47:00,787
just as fast as you can make it.

1672
01:47:00,862 --> 01:47:02,830
- Yes, sir.
- Get going.

1673
01:47:03,031 --> 01:47:05,591
- Good-bye, Harry.
- Good trip, sir.

1674
01:47:06,101 --> 01:47:08,934
- Bus.
- Yes, sir?

1675
01:47:09,004 --> 01:47:12,701
You were going to tell me
something before about Charlie on D-day.

1676
01:47:12,774 --> 01:47:15,709
Nothing, sir. Have a good flight.

1677
01:47:15,844 --> 01:47:18,472
Don't forget I want him
in Washington tomorrow.

1678
01:47:18,546 --> 01:47:21,242
I don't care what brass
you have to throw off the plane.

1679
01:47:21,316 --> 01:47:23,750
I'll have him on the first flight
out of Southampton.

1680
01:47:23,818 --> 01:47:25,945
You'd better move back there, sir.

1681
01:47:26,287 --> 01:47:28,278
What I didn't tell the Admiral back there...

1682
01:47:28,356 --> 01:47:31,985
was that Charlie Madison became
the first American on Omaha Beach...

1683
01:47:32,060 --> 01:47:35,757
because I chased him up there
with a Colt.45.

1684
01:47:35,830 --> 01:47:38,492
He was, in fact, running the other way...

1685
01:47:38,566 --> 01:47:42,798
bolting under fire,
an errant act of cowardice!

1686
01:47:42,871 --> 01:47:45,431
Our big brass-band hero...

1687
01:47:45,507 --> 01:47:48,032
is a big brass-band coward!

1688
01:47:49,511 --> 01:47:51,706
But I didn't tell the Admiral that...

1689
01:47:51,780 --> 01:47:54,772
because the Navy needs a hero...

1690
01:47:54,849 --> 01:47:59,843
even a miserable, lousy, yellow,
cowardly hero like Charlie Madison.

1691
01:48:00,855 --> 01:48:03,790
It's a hoax, Emily.
The whole thing's a hoax.

1692
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:07,424
That's my Charlie. Craven to the end.

1693
01:48:08,096 --> 01:48:09,290
- Spaulding.
- Yo.

1694
01:48:10,165 --> 01:48:13,225
Clear me a space for Madison
on the first flight out of Southampton.

1695
01:48:13,301 --> 01:48:16,065
- I'll call him from the hospital there.
- Right.

1696
01:48:18,540 --> 01:48:21,441
Harry, I'm in the administration office
right now.

1697
01:48:21,509 --> 01:48:24,239
I can have Madison at the airport by 1:00.

1698
01:48:24,312 --> 01:48:25,973
Now don't worry about it.

1699
01:48:26,047 --> 01:48:29,676
You just clear a place on the plane
for him, that's all.

1700
01:48:29,751 --> 01:48:32,151
You told Grisam!
What do you mean? When?

1701
01:48:32,353 --> 01:48:35,015
He told the public relations office.

1702
01:48:35,090 --> 01:48:37,854
Harry, we'll have every correspondent
in London down here.

1703
01:48:37,926 --> 01:48:40,121
What the hell's the matter with you?

1704
01:48:40,195 --> 01:48:42,595
Why don't you go on through
and wait for him outside?

1705
01:48:42,664 --> 01:48:44,131
Thank you.

1706
01:49:14,329 --> 01:49:16,763
You're limping, Commander.

1707
01:49:16,965 --> 01:49:18,933
The old wound acting up?

1708
01:49:22,036 --> 01:49:23,799
Where have you been?

1709
01:49:23,872 --> 01:49:26,670
We expected you back
a week ago yesterday.

1710
01:49:27,408 --> 01:49:30,070
I'm sorry. I had to go
to France for a few days.

1711
01:49:30,145 --> 01:49:32,579
It's out of season this time of year.

1712
01:49:33,515 --> 01:49:36,075
No one worth knowing was there,
I'm sure.

1713
01:49:36,184 --> 01:49:39,312
Very rough element
going to France these days.

1714
01:49:40,755 --> 01:49:43,280
Oh, Charlie.

1715
01:49:44,959 --> 01:49:48,122
- Careful, my leg.
- Shut up. Let me hold you.

1716
01:50:02,010 --> 01:50:05,138
Don't you get within a cane's distance,
you tried to kill me.

1717
01:50:05,213 --> 01:50:08,046
Come on, don't make
such a big dramatic deal out of this.

1718
01:50:08,116 --> 01:50:10,277
I've got a plane waiting
to take you to Washington.

1719
01:50:10,351 --> 01:50:12,581
We've got to be at the airport
in half an hour.

1720
01:50:12,654 --> 01:50:14,884
There are 20 reporters waiting
in the office...

1721
01:50:14,956 --> 01:50:16,423
more piling in every minute.

1722
01:50:16,491 --> 01:50:19,153
We'll have five minutes for photos
and a few questions.

1723
01:50:19,327 --> 01:50:22,694
- Let me brief you on what you're to say.
- I'm going to say the truth.

1724
01:50:22,764 --> 01:50:24,857
I don't know how much of my little hoax
you know.

1725
01:50:24,933 --> 01:50:25,922
Enough.

1726
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:28,730
Your last words said
as you led the charge up the beach were:

1727
01:50:28,803 --> 01:50:31,363
"Okay, men, let's show them
whose beach this is."

1728
01:50:31,539 --> 01:50:35,100
Not quite the epic stature of
"We've just begun to fight."

1729
01:50:35,276 --> 01:50:36,766
Yeah, you know.

1730
01:50:37,045 --> 01:50:38,910
I'm going to tell them the truth, Bus.

1731
01:50:38,980 --> 01:50:43,417
I'm going to tell anyone who asks
the plain, unattractive, not epic, truth.

1732
01:50:43,484 --> 01:50:45,213
We don't have very much time.

1733
01:50:45,286 --> 01:50:49,916
I'm going to tell them a deranged admiral
had a demented idea for a lunatic movie...

1734
01:50:50,158 --> 01:50:54,356
whose only purpose was to juice up
the Navy's bid for military appropriations.

1735
01:50:54,429 --> 01:50:56,829
And my gallant wounds
were inflicted on me...

1736
01:50:56,898 --> 01:50:59,093
by my brother officer, the fink...

1737
01:50:59,200 --> 01:51:01,828
You've got a legitimate beef
against me. Okay.

1738
01:51:02,003 --> 01:51:04,494
And that my last inspirational words...

1739
01:51:04,572 --> 01:51:06,631
as I led the charge
away from the beach were...

1740
01:51:06,708 --> 01:51:08,869
"Let's get the hell out of here."

1741
01:51:09,010 --> 01:51:10,602
I've had a bad week, Bus.

1742
01:51:10,812 --> 01:51:13,280
I was in battle
and I've heard the horror of it again.

1743
01:51:13,348 --> 01:51:15,373
I will not contribute
to your wretched hoax.

1744
01:51:15,450 --> 01:51:17,918
I will not help you
preserve the wonder of war.

1745
01:51:18,052 --> 01:51:20,452
I want people to know I was a coward.

1746
01:51:20,521 --> 01:51:23,888
I want them to know
the whole shabby story about my heroism.

1747
01:51:23,992 --> 01:51:26,324
I don't understand you.
Do you know what'll happen...

1748
01:51:26,394 --> 01:51:27,452
I know what'll happen.

1749
01:51:27,528 --> 01:51:29,826
I'll embarrass my country,
dishonor my service...

1750
01:51:29,897 --> 01:51:31,922
disgrace my admiral,
and humiliate my family...

1751
01:51:32,000 --> 01:51:34,195
and get thrown in the brig
for a couple of years.

1752
01:51:34,335 --> 01:51:35,529
Then why do it?

1753
01:51:35,670 --> 01:51:37,968
Because it's the right thing to do.

1754
01:51:38,039 --> 01:51:40,007
I can't believe it.

1755
01:51:40,074 --> 01:51:42,065
Is this the Charlie Madison who once said:

1756
01:51:42,143 --> 01:51:44,839
"God save us from all the people
who do the right thing...

1757
01:51:44,912 --> 01:51:47,073
"it's the rest of us
who get our backs broken?"

1758
01:51:47,148 --> 01:51:48,809
Are you seriously going to destroy...

1759
01:51:48,883 --> 01:51:50,714
everything that means anything to you...

1760
01:51:50,785 --> 01:51:52,980
in a futile gesture of virtue?

1761
01:51:53,888 --> 01:51:55,947
You're going to put yourself in jail,
are you?

1762
01:51:56,024 --> 01:51:58,925
- I don't care what happens to me.
- How bloody brave.

1763
01:51:58,993 --> 01:52:02,520
But you do care what happens to me.
At least you said you did.

1764
01:52:02,664 --> 01:52:03,892
What am I supposed to do...

1765
01:52:03,965 --> 01:52:06,661
whilst you sit in your prison cell
for five or six years...

1766
01:52:06,734 --> 01:52:09,066
admiring the glisten
of your own martyrdom?

1767
01:52:09,137 --> 01:52:12,004
Emily, I want the world to know
what a fraud war is.

1768
01:52:12,073 --> 01:52:15,270
But war isn't a fraud, Charlie. It's very real.

1769
01:52:15,476 --> 01:52:18,343
At least, that's what you've
always tried to tell me, isn't it?

1770
01:52:18,546 --> 01:52:21,538
That we shall never get rid of war
by pretending it's unreal.

1771
01:52:21,616 --> 01:52:24,983
It's the virtue of war that's the fraud,
not war itself.

1772
01:52:25,119 --> 01:52:27,815
It's the valor and the self-sacrifice...

1773
01:52:27,889 --> 01:52:30,824
and the goodness of war
that needs the exposing.

1774
01:52:31,626 --> 01:52:34,891
Here you are
being brave and self-sacrificing...

1775
01:52:34,962 --> 01:52:39,262
positively clanking with moral fervor,
perpetuating the very things you detest...

1776
01:52:39,334 --> 01:52:41,666
merely to do "the right thing."

1777
01:52:42,103 --> 01:52:45,300
Honestly, Charlie, your conversion
to morality is really quite funny.

1778
01:52:45,373 --> 01:52:48,274
All this time, I've been terrified
of becoming Americanized...

1779
01:52:48,409 --> 01:52:51,674
and you, you silly ass,
have turned into a bloody Englishman.

1780
01:52:52,180 --> 01:52:54,774
There's a matter of principle involved here.

1781
01:52:54,949 --> 01:52:56,712
A matter of what?

1782
01:52:56,784 --> 01:52:59,776
Charlie, didn't you once say:

1783
01:53:00,088 --> 01:53:02,989
"What's a lion doing
in a man's house anyway?"

1784
01:53:04,292 --> 01:53:07,955
Emily, if a man knows the truth,
he has to say it.

1785
01:53:10,865 --> 01:53:12,992
Is this the Charlie Madison who once said:

1786
01:53:13,067 --> 01:53:15,558
"I'm not equipped to deal with the truth.

1787
01:53:15,636 --> 01:53:18,104
"I let God worry about the truth.

1788
01:53:18,172 --> 01:53:21,437
"I just want to know
the momentary fact of things."

1789
01:53:21,509 --> 01:53:23,067
And your idea of facts, you said...

1790
01:53:23,144 --> 01:53:27,376
Were you, a home, a country, a world...

1791
01:53:27,448 --> 01:53:29,814
and the universe. In that order.

1792
01:53:31,252 --> 01:53:34,551
I'm quite prepared to supply all that
as my end of the deal.

1793
01:53:35,556 --> 01:53:37,581
What do you get out of it?

1794
01:53:39,127 --> 01:53:41,595
I'll settle for a Hershey bar.

1795
01:53:43,998 --> 01:53:46,865
Bus, there's a million of them there.

1796
01:53:46,934 --> 01:53:48,868
There's correspondents all over the place.

1797
01:53:48,936 --> 01:53:49,561
Hi, Charlie.

1798
01:53:53,107 --> 01:53:56,099
All right, fink,
how do you want me to play it...

1799
01:53:56,177 --> 01:53:58,202
modest and self-effacing?
