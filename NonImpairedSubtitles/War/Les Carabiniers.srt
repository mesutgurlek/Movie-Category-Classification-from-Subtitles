1
00:00:01,324 --> 00:00:02,916
Let it roll!

2
00:00:02,993 --> 00:00:04,927
Military March, take one!

3
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:06,622
''More and more...

4
00:00:06,696 --> 00:00:08,220
''l strive for simplicity.

5
00:00:08,298 --> 00:00:09,788
''l use worn metaphors.

6
00:00:09,866 --> 00:00:11,128
''lt's what's basically eternal.

7
00:00:11,201 --> 00:00:12,463
''For example,
stars resemble eyes...

8
00:00:12,536 --> 00:00:15,198
or death is like sleep.''

9
00:00:19,376 --> 00:00:20,843
Military March, take one.

10
00:00:31,121 --> 00:00:34,579
The Riflemen

11
00:01:58,742 --> 00:02:00,369
Michelangelo, come here!

12
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,368
Mama! The riflemen! Mama!

13
00:03:00,403 --> 00:03:02,098
Shut up, miss! Hands up!

14
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:05,033
Mama!

15
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:07,076
Shut up!

16
00:03:14,084 --> 00:03:15,016
Hands up!

17
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:16,177
We did nothing!

18
00:03:16,253 --> 00:03:17,220
Move!

19
00:03:18,421 --> 00:03:19,388
Over there!

20
00:03:20,757 --> 00:03:22,054
On the double!

21
00:04:19,582 --> 00:04:21,174
You're crazy.

22
00:04:21,251 --> 00:04:22,878
We've done nothing.

23
00:04:28,591 --> 00:04:30,024
We didn't say ya did!

24
00:04:30,093 --> 00:04:31,685
l did nothing, either.

25
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:34,127
And l said
l didn't say ya did!

26
00:04:35,765 --> 00:04:38,029
So why'd ya come?

27
00:04:38,101 --> 00:04:39,864
We got a letter for ya.

28
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:41,130
A letter from who?

29
00:04:41,204 --> 00:04:43,297
A letter from the King.

30
00:04:47,243 --> 00:04:48,540
A letter from the King?

31
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:49,873
What a joke!

32
00:04:49,946 --> 00:04:51,413
Yes, a letter from the King.

33
00:04:56,286 --> 00:04:57,810
l don't believe ya.

34
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:02,550
Here it is.

35
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:03,922
Let me have it.

36
00:05:05,829 --> 00:05:07,421
lt's not true!

37
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,607
Look!

38
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:23,911
Look...

39
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,345
the King.

40
00:05:35,191 --> 00:05:38,524
''Mo-bil-i-za-tion.''

41
00:05:38,595 --> 00:05:39,687
What's that mean?

42
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:40,889
War.

43
00:05:42,932 --> 00:05:44,297
The King wrote Ulysses
and Michelangelo!

44
00:05:44,367 --> 00:05:45,299
Great!

45
00:05:45,368 --> 00:05:46,630
There's something
l don't understand.

46
00:05:46,703 --> 00:05:47,635
What?

47
00:05:47,704 --> 00:05:49,296
Why'd the King write to me?

48
00:05:49,372 --> 00:05:51,636
He wants a personal favor.

49
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:53,642
The King? From me?

50
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,473
Yes. You'll see.

51
00:05:55,545 --> 00:05:57,513
Let's go inside.
l'm freezing.

52
00:06:01,885 --> 00:06:04,820
During the hard times
we're going through...

53
00:06:04,888 --> 00:06:07,823
with suffering saddening
the people...

54
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:11,657
the police should take
into consideration...

55
00:06:11,728 --> 00:06:13,889
how to distract the population.

56
00:06:22,672 --> 00:06:24,264
Sit down!

57
00:06:25,909 --> 00:06:28,571
We've been on the road.

58
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:33,844
Take off your coat.

59
00:06:33,917 --> 00:06:36,511
No, thanks. l'm fine.

60
00:06:36,586 --> 00:06:37,678
Coffee?

61
00:06:37,754 --> 00:06:38,743
OK.

62
00:06:47,263 --> 00:06:48,890
Got a cigar?

63
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,589
OK.

64
00:06:54,938 --> 00:06:55,905
Here.

65
00:07:01,444 --> 00:07:03,708
Oh, sorry.
The electricity's off.

66
00:07:09,118 --> 00:07:10,881
My wife's gorgeous.

67
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:12,546
She has heart-shaped lips.

68
00:07:12,622 --> 00:07:14,419
l love that.

69
00:07:29,172 --> 00:07:30,104
Have a seat.

70
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:31,140
Thanks.

71
00:08:13,850 --> 00:08:15,442
lf the King wants a favor...

72
00:08:15,518 --> 00:08:17,281
it means he considers me
a friend.

73
00:08:17,353 --> 00:08:18,342
Yes.

74
00:08:27,864 --> 00:08:30,992
Really...the King
considers me his friend.

75
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:31,999
Yes.

76
00:08:32,068 --> 00:08:33,000
Right?

77
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:34,036
Yeah, sure.

78
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:48,112
''Mobilization.'' That means
we gotta go to war?

79
00:08:48,184 --> 00:08:49,173
Yes.

80
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:54,486
When do we leave?

81
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:02,722
Today.

82
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,503
Shit!

83
00:09:08,571 --> 00:09:09,503
Why?

84
00:09:09,572 --> 00:09:10,561
Because.

85
00:09:22,285 --> 00:09:23,752
War's no fun.

86
00:09:30,593 --> 00:09:31,890
On the contrary.

87
00:09:35,331 --> 00:09:37,492
What'll become of us?

88
00:09:39,869 --> 00:09:40,801
Right.

89
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,497
We'll be ruined.

90
00:09:44,674 --> 00:09:46,801
On the contrary.
You'll be wealthy.

91
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:48,969
How so?

92
00:09:49,045 --> 00:09:50,137
How?

93
00:09:55,051 --> 00:09:57,178
Yes, how?
That really interests me.

94
00:10:07,063 --> 00:10:08,690
We'll explain it to you.

95
00:10:10,533 --> 00:10:15,027
You'll enrich your minds
by visiting foreign countries.

96
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:18,707
Then you'll become very rich.

97
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:25,047
You'll be able to have
whatever you wish.

98
00:10:29,252 --> 00:10:30,344
OK.

99
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,717
But where's all that?

100
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:41,355
With the enemy.

101
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:44,628
You take it
from the enemy.

102
00:10:44,701 --> 00:10:46,931
Not only lands and herds...

103
00:10:47,003 --> 00:10:50,495
but houses, palaces,
cities, cars...

104
00:10:50,573 --> 00:10:53,838
movies, dime-stores,
stations, airports...

105
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:57,846
swimming pools,
casinos, theaters...

106
00:10:57,914 --> 00:11:01,179
bouquets of flowers,
arches of triumph...

107
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:05,346
cigar factories,
printing plants...

108
00:11:05,421 --> 00:11:07,912
lighters, airplanes...

109
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,218
ladies of the world.

110
00:11:16,599 --> 00:11:18,089
Freight trains.

111
00:11:19,635 --> 00:11:22,729
Fountain pens,
jewelry shops...

112
00:11:22,805 --> 00:11:26,935
Alfa Romeos,
Hawaiian guitars.

113
00:11:30,146 --> 00:11:31,738
Splendid landscapes...

114
00:11:31,814 --> 00:11:35,250
elephants, locomotives...

115
00:11:35,318 --> 00:11:36,683
subway stations.

116
00:11:39,489 --> 00:11:43,255
Rolls Royces, Maseratis...

117
00:11:43,326 --> 00:11:45,226
women who get undressed.

118
00:11:52,435 --> 00:11:53,402
Locomotives!

119
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:54,595
Diamonds!

120
00:11:55,638 --> 00:11:56,969
Chocolate factories!

121
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,063
Maseratis!

122
00:11:58,141 --> 00:12:00,701
We can really have all that?

123
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:02,802
Yes, all that.

124
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:04,244
Oh, that's nothing.

125
00:12:04,313 --> 00:12:05,940
l got a question.

126
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:09,576
Wherever they go,
they can take what they want?

127
00:12:09,652 --> 00:12:11,415
Yes. l just told you that.

128
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:12,647
Wonderful!

129
00:12:15,158 --> 00:12:16,591
What's wrong?

130
00:12:16,659 --> 00:12:19,287
Go on, asshole!
Go to war! Fast!

131
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:25,964
l don't know...

132
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:29,462
Sure. Go on.

133
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:30,563
Assholes.

134
00:12:37,747 --> 00:12:38,805
So, what's going on?

135
00:12:38,881 --> 00:12:39,813
l'm hesitating.

136
00:12:39,882 --> 00:12:40,849
Why?

137
00:12:43,052 --> 00:12:43,950
Why?

138
00:12:47,657 --> 00:12:48,624
Why?

139
00:12:49,826 --> 00:12:51,418
You say it,
but it's not true.

140
00:12:51,494 --> 00:12:54,258
lt is, too.
Ya don't know what war is.

141
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:56,298
You'll see.
lt's extraordinary.

142
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,264
Won't we be punished
for stealing?

143
00:13:00,336 --> 00:13:01,268
No.

144
00:13:01,337 --> 00:13:02,998
ln war, anything goes.

145
00:13:04,874 --> 00:13:06,808
What's to prove that?

146
00:13:06,876 --> 00:13:07,843
The proof...

147
00:13:08,878 --> 00:13:10,846
the King's letter.

148
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:15,317
-Here.
-lt proves nothing!

149
00:13:15,384 --> 00:13:16,817
Of course it does.

150
00:13:16,886 --> 00:13:20,151
Each soldier can
do as he wants...

151
00:13:20,223 --> 00:13:21,656
in the name of the King.

152
00:13:21,724 --> 00:13:23,021
So, sign it.

153
00:13:26,395 --> 00:13:27,726
Yes, sign it.

154
00:13:27,797 --> 00:13:30,197
-OK.
-Get my pen from the jeep.

155
00:13:44,513 --> 00:13:45,480
l got a question.

156
00:13:45,548 --> 00:13:46,515
Go ahead.

157
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:50,644
ln the war,
can we take slot machines?

158
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,153
Yes.

159
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:55,122
No charges if we take
old men's eyeglasses?

160
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:59,152
Can we break a kid's arm?

161
00:13:59,228 --> 00:14:00,195
Both arms?

162
00:14:03,065 --> 00:14:05,192
Stab a guy in the back?

163
00:14:07,737 --> 00:14:10,467
Rob apartments?

164
00:14:11,774 --> 00:14:13,264
Burn towns?

165
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:17,874
Burn women?

166
00:14:17,947 --> 00:14:18,914
Yes.

167
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:23,877
And steal classy pants?

168
00:14:23,953 --> 00:14:24,920
Yes.

169
00:14:28,791 --> 00:14:30,884
lf we want, we can
massacre innocent folks?

170
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:31,927
Yes.

171
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:35,222
Denounce folks, too?

172
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:36,265
Yes.

173
00:14:37,466 --> 00:14:39,900
Eat in restaurants and not pay?

174
00:14:39,969 --> 00:14:41,266
Yes, yes. That's war.

175
00:14:55,952 --> 00:14:57,544
Yes.

176
00:14:57,620 --> 00:14:59,747
We'll have a lamb
to celebrate.

177
00:15:10,132 --> 00:15:11,599
Bring me a horse!

178
00:15:13,803 --> 00:15:15,600
A velvet dress for me!

179
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:19,808
And some ribbons!

180
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:23,603
A Max Factor lipstick.

181
00:15:23,679 --> 00:15:24,737
And a washing machine!

182
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,903
Ulysses!

183
00:15:50,973 --> 00:15:51,962
Yes?

184
00:15:54,343 --> 00:15:55,275
Don't forget!

185
00:15:55,344 --> 00:15:56,606
No.

186
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:57,805
Hurry!

187
00:15:59,015 --> 00:16:00,778
Bye, Cleopatra!

188
00:16:00,850 --> 00:16:02,147
Hurry up!

189
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:08,315
Go! Quick!

190
00:16:11,861 --> 00:16:12,885
Bye!

191
00:16:13,929 --> 00:16:15,328
Bring me a bikini!

192
00:16:15,398 --> 00:16:16,330
What?

193
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:17,889
A bikini!

194
00:16:36,452 --> 00:16:40,252
What do soldiers do
before battle?

195
00:16:54,904 --> 00:16:58,670
Before battle,
soldiers are afraid.

196
00:17:05,748 --> 00:17:07,682
We landed in ltaly...

197
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:11,413
and lined our path
with a thousand bodies.

198
00:17:26,435 --> 00:17:28,403
We're gonna take a hit!

199
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:35,904
We saw grenadiers die
without a cry...

200
00:17:35,978 --> 00:17:38,412
generals with gaping bellies...

201
00:17:38,481 --> 00:17:41,382
bloody uniforms, holes for eyes.

202
00:17:44,086 --> 00:17:46,554
The day of glory is at hand!

203
00:18:03,472 --> 00:18:06,236
Even so, it's a nice summer.

204
00:18:16,085 --> 00:18:18,417
We're sowing death
in the families...

205
00:18:18,487 --> 00:18:20,853
and fulfilling
our bloody mission.

206
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,598
Got any money?

207
00:18:31,667 --> 00:18:33,601
No. We're poor.

208
00:18:33,669 --> 00:18:34,795
Take a look.

209
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,412
You got any money?

210
00:18:45,481 --> 00:18:47,073
No, we're poor.

211
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:48,275
We'll see about that!

212
00:19:00,162 --> 00:19:01,322
Over there!

213
00:19:16,712 --> 00:19:18,304
Send her out!

214
00:19:18,380 --> 00:19:19,677
Go in the kitchen.

215
00:19:25,054 --> 00:19:26,681
Up on the chair!

216
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:31,860
Turn around!

217
00:19:42,171 --> 00:19:43,365
What're ya doin'?

218
00:19:45,241 --> 00:19:46,367
l'm looking!

219
00:20:00,456 --> 00:20:02,253
Where'd ya put the old guy?

220
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,572
l'll be back.

221
00:20:18,641 --> 00:20:20,268
Where'd ya put the old guy?

222
00:20:29,685 --> 00:20:30,811
Get down!

223
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:38,493
Take off your sweater!

224
00:20:59,114 --> 00:21:01,139
A soldier salutes an artist!

225
00:21:06,188 --> 00:21:07,314
Don't move!

226
00:21:12,695 --> 00:21:14,162
Take off your dress!

227
00:21:17,032 --> 00:21:18,158
lf you please.

228
00:21:56,038 --> 00:21:57,335
On your knees!

229
00:22:03,545 --> 00:22:04,512
Forward!

230
00:22:06,682 --> 00:22:07,671
Forward!

231
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:10,548
''Giddy-up, horsy!''
said little Claus. ''Hup!''

232
00:22:11,587 --> 00:22:13,179
Hurry up.

233
00:22:13,255 --> 00:22:15,223
lt's always the same thing!

234
00:22:35,711 --> 00:22:37,542
Always the same words:

235
00:22:37,613 --> 00:22:40,241
bodies, decay, rot, death, etc.

236
00:23:07,943 --> 00:23:10,878
We were trucked
into Northern Silesia...

237
00:23:10,946 --> 00:23:13,039
to be firing squads...

238
00:23:13,115 --> 00:23:15,640
and check on hangings.

239
00:23:21,590 --> 00:23:28,553
''10 Hostages Were Shot Today.''

240
00:24:42,738 --> 00:24:44,296
Yes, yes! Yes, yes!

241
00:24:59,221 --> 00:25:00,188
Stop!

242
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:12,827
Who are they?

243
00:25:12,901 --> 00:25:14,334
Hostages to be shot.

244
00:25:14,403 --> 00:25:16,166
l don't have the time.

245
00:25:16,238 --> 00:25:17,330
Where's Juno?

246
00:25:17,406 --> 00:25:18,668
No. Died in battle.

247
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:19,672
Poliansky?

248
00:25:19,741 --> 00:25:20,673
Died in battle.

249
00:25:20,742 --> 00:25:21,674
Mitchum?

250
00:25:21,743 --> 00:25:22,835
Died in battle.

251
00:25:22,911 --> 00:25:24,708
So do it on your own.

252
00:25:33,655 --> 00:25:36,055
One of our most
urgent jobs is...

253
00:25:36,124 --> 00:25:37,887
to find all the King's enemies.

254
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,224
To do so, we are ready...

255
00:25:40,295 --> 00:25:43,230
to shed our own blood
and that of others.

256
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:10,758
Cigarette?

257
00:26:12,294 --> 00:26:13,886
How far we goin'?

258
00:26:13,962 --> 00:26:15,759
Till l find a pretty spot.

259
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:09,776
Hands up!

260
00:27:52,861 --> 00:27:54,158
Get their stuff!

261
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:01,634
Got the blindfolds?

262
00:28:01,703 --> 00:28:03,136
No.

263
00:28:03,205 --> 00:28:04,194
Never mind.

264
00:28:17,052 --> 00:28:18,178
Ready!

265
00:28:19,221 --> 00:28:22,384
1...2...3!

266
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:40,865
At times we make them...

267
00:28:40,942 --> 00:28:43,376
lie on the previous bodies...

268
00:28:43,445 --> 00:28:46,471
and shoot them in that position.

269
00:28:56,591 --> 00:28:58,354
The King asks his people...

270
00:28:58,426 --> 00:28:59,688
to commemorate forever...

271
00:28:59,761 --> 00:29:02,025
our sons' heroic combat...

272
00:29:02,097 --> 00:29:04,361
in Europe and Oceania.

273
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:13,707
At these pyramids, we've seen...

274
00:29:13,775 --> 00:29:16,539
centuries of history
contemplate us.

275
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:30,918
Yesterday the war began...

276
00:29:30,992 --> 00:29:33,256
its 3rd springtime...

277
00:29:33,328 --> 00:29:35,922
henceforth offering
no sight of peace.

278
00:29:47,676 --> 00:29:49,439
The captain took our ammo.

279
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:51,945
We fought 132 days
with knives...

280
00:29:52,013 --> 00:29:53,412
to save Rostov.

281
00:30:11,199 --> 00:30:12,996
Officers distribute books...

282
00:30:13,068 --> 00:30:15,161
about the great conquerors.

283
00:30:15,237 --> 00:30:18,331
We memorize their battles and...

284
00:30:18,406 --> 00:30:21,102
study their magnificent lives.

285
00:31:41,656 --> 00:31:42,782
What is it?

286
00:31:47,462 --> 00:31:48,929
Say your prayers!

287
00:31:55,470 --> 00:31:56,767
What're you doing there?

288
00:31:58,807 --> 00:32:03,073
Commandeering buildings
and killing the guardians.

289
00:32:03,144 --> 00:32:04,805
They said it's allowed.

290
00:32:10,151 --> 00:32:12,585
The King's spies and police...

291
00:32:12,654 --> 00:32:14,588
infiltrate the universities...

292
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:16,248
but can't destroy...

293
00:32:16,324 --> 00:32:17,791
the tradition of freedom...

294
00:32:17,859 --> 00:32:19,087
the students cherish.

295
00:32:30,839 --> 00:32:32,807
We kill people in groups...

296
00:32:32,874 --> 00:32:34,967
with a bullet to the head.

297
00:32:35,043 --> 00:32:36,806
Once the hole's full...

298
00:32:36,878 --> 00:32:38,812
we fill it with dirt.

299
00:33:12,047 --> 00:33:13,981
Have him get out.

300
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:15,016
Get out!

301
00:33:30,932 --> 00:33:32,024
Are you a Mexican?

302
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:33,067
Yes.

303
00:33:34,602 --> 00:33:36,035
ls he your husband?

304
00:33:36,104 --> 00:33:37,071
No.

305
00:33:38,606 --> 00:33:40,198
Pity.

306
00:33:40,275 --> 00:33:41,902
Because l wanted to say...

307
00:33:43,111 --> 00:33:45,511
''l've never seen a Mex-who-can.''

308
00:33:52,087 --> 00:33:54,146
We rip women's rings off...

309
00:33:54,222 --> 00:33:56,315
and make people undress...

310
00:33:56,391 --> 00:33:57,983
when we shoot them...

311
00:33:58,059 --> 00:33:59,856
naked by anti-tank traps.

312
00:34:18,446 --> 00:34:19,708
Come look!

313
00:34:19,781 --> 00:34:20,748
Cleopatra?

314
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:27,885
Look! Look what
l brought ya!

315
00:34:27,956 --> 00:34:29,583
And this is for Venus!

316
00:34:56,885 --> 00:34:59,376
Yesterday we captured
Santa Cruz.

317
00:34:59,454 --> 00:35:01,547
The girls threw us flowers.

318
00:35:01,623 --> 00:35:04,615
That night l saw my first movie.

319
00:35:58,913 --> 00:36:01,211
''Superboy and Holgat...

320
00:36:01,282 --> 00:36:04,945
''roamed the mesa in search...

321
00:36:05,019 --> 00:36:07,112
''of the 2 mysterious men.

322
00:36:07,188 --> 00:36:10,988
'''Superboy, why are you
interested in these men?'

323
00:36:11,059 --> 00:36:12,356
'''Like you, Steve...

324
00:36:12,427 --> 00:36:15,294
''l think they're
from elsewhere.'''

325
00:36:15,363 --> 00:36:16,489
Eat your pie!

326
00:36:16,564 --> 00:36:17,496
No.

327
00:36:17,565 --> 00:36:19,328
Eat up, dammit!

328
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,833
No.

329
00:36:20,902 --> 00:36:25,669
Son of a fascist bitch!

330
00:36:28,376 --> 00:36:32,073
A Worldly Lady in her Bath.

331
00:39:12,006 --> 00:39:14,736
We're in the Condor Legion.

332
00:39:17,211 --> 00:39:20,203
We leave blood and death
behind us.

333
00:39:20,281 --> 00:39:22,044
With tender kisses...

334
00:39:26,954 --> 00:39:29,388
lf Papa knew it, tra-la-la!

335
00:39:29,457 --> 00:39:32,426
He'd break my hand, tra-la-la!

336
00:39:32,493 --> 00:39:35,724
Keep marching, boys!

337
00:39:35,797 --> 00:39:39,563
Keep marching, boys!

338
00:39:39,634 --> 00:39:43,468
l lost my clarinet's flange.

339
00:39:47,341 --> 00:39:48,638
Go that way!

340
00:39:55,683 --> 00:39:57,150
Ulysses, the machine gun.

341
00:40:44,365 --> 00:40:47,129
Do eels have a soul?

342
00:40:47,201 --> 00:40:48,691
l got no idea.

343
00:40:50,571 --> 00:40:51,503
Michelangelo.

344
00:40:51,572 --> 00:40:52,869
The machine gun.

345
00:42:15,623 --> 00:42:17,090
Hands up! Get up!

346
00:42:18,125 --> 00:42:19,092
Get over here!

347
00:42:29,337 --> 00:42:30,497
Help!

348
00:42:40,982 --> 00:42:42,006
Hands up!

349
00:42:54,762 --> 00:42:55,786
Who are you?

350
00:42:57,264 --> 00:42:58,231
Who are you?

351
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:03,400
Who are you?

352
00:43:13,648 --> 00:43:16,242
4th Territorial Action Group.

353
00:43:18,653 --> 00:43:20,587
Why are you fighting us?

354
00:43:20,655 --> 00:43:21,952
We're friends.

355
00:43:27,161 --> 00:43:28,458
Lenin said...

356
00:43:30,831 --> 00:43:32,799
''Bourgeois capitalism...''

357
00:43:35,169 --> 00:43:37,467
''and its reactionaries...''

358
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,338
''are merely evil insects...''

359
00:43:43,377 --> 00:43:45,777
''and must be considered
as such...''

360
00:43:48,983 --> 00:43:52,077
''by the international
proletariat.''

361
00:43:53,654 --> 00:43:54,916
She's a pain. Shoot her.

362
00:43:54,989 --> 00:43:56,081
And him?

363
00:43:56,157 --> 00:43:57,124
Him, too.

364
00:44:05,166 --> 00:44:06,133
Michelangelo.

365
00:44:12,206 --> 00:44:13,833
Put this on her head.

366
00:44:17,044 --> 00:44:18,511
Or they won't dare fire.

367
00:44:43,404 --> 00:44:44,302
My brothers!

368
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,333
My brothers!

369
00:44:49,710 --> 00:44:50,677
My brothers!

370
00:45:11,398 --> 00:45:13,161
You have something to say?

371
00:45:13,234 --> 00:45:16,829
l'd like to recite
a wonderful fable by Mayakovsky.

372
00:45:16,904 --> 00:45:18,496
Never mind!

373
00:45:18,572 --> 00:45:20,540
This can't be Death.

374
00:45:20,608 --> 00:45:23,372
Why would she hang about here?

375
00:45:23,444 --> 00:45:26,709
Aren't you ashamed
to believe in a fable?

376
00:45:26,781 --> 00:45:28,715
Someone has a party...

377
00:45:28,783 --> 00:45:30,580
creates a carnival...

378
00:45:31,786 --> 00:45:33,413
invents this killing...

379
00:45:35,122 --> 00:45:39,058
as he blinks his eyes.

380
00:45:39,126 --> 00:45:43,062
She is charming,
but like the cannons.

381
00:45:43,130 --> 00:45:46,657
The gas mask
is but a simple toy.

382
00:45:46,734 --> 00:45:47,996
See?

383
00:45:50,404 --> 00:45:53,498
ln her careful course...

384
00:45:53,574 --> 00:45:55,235
she measures the heavens.

385
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:03,876
Has Death slipped
on the floor of the sky?

386
00:46:03,951 --> 00:46:07,114
Don't say a wound's
blood is awful.

387
00:46:07,188 --> 00:46:09,884
Simply, to honor heros...

388
00:46:09,957 --> 00:46:11,618
we gave them carnations.

389
00:46:11,692 --> 00:46:16,391
True, the mind won't
and can't understand it.

390
00:46:16,463 --> 00:46:19,057
lf cannons' necks
aren't for kissing...

391
00:46:19,133 --> 00:46:22,728
why do the trenches' arms
embrace them?

392
00:46:22,803 --> 00:46:24,771
No one has been killed.

393
00:46:24,839 --> 00:46:28,935
Too weary, all have lain down,
from the Seine to the Rhine...

394
00:46:29,009 --> 00:46:32,672
as gangrene flowers
among the slain.

395
00:46:32,746 --> 00:46:34,941
Who says ''slain''?

396
00:46:35,015 --> 00:46:36,448
No! No.

397
00:46:36,517 --> 00:46:38,280
All are going to rise again...

398
00:46:38,352 --> 00:46:43,119
and come smiling home
and tell their wives...

399
00:46:43,190 --> 00:46:44,384
''What a joke it was!

400
00:46:44,458 --> 00:46:46,255
''What a phenomenon!''

401
00:46:48,896 --> 00:46:52,559
They'll say,
''There were no shells nor mines.

402
00:46:52,633 --> 00:46:54,567
''There wasn't even a fort.

403
00:46:54,635 --> 00:46:59,402
''lt was all a great fable
for your birthday!''

404
00:46:59,473 --> 00:47:01,907
1...2...3!

405
00:47:22,529 --> 00:47:23,826
She's still moving.

406
00:47:27,701 --> 00:47:28,668
Again.

407
00:47:31,205 --> 00:47:32,297
Again!

408
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:35,864
Again.

409
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:52,124
There is no victory.

410
00:47:52,192 --> 00:47:54,285
Only flags and...

411
00:47:54,361 --> 00:47:56,022
fallen men.

412
00:49:00,394 --> 00:49:01,952
After desperate combat...

413
00:49:02,029 --> 00:49:03,621
the 8th Royal Army...

414
00:49:03,697 --> 00:49:05,289
surrendered April 9th...

415
00:49:05,366 --> 00:49:07,163
overwhelmed by human suffering.

416
00:49:51,812 --> 00:49:52,744
Hello.

417
00:49:52,813 --> 00:49:54,337
Hello, sir.

418
00:49:54,415 --> 00:49:56,144
l want a Maserati.

419
00:50:07,094 --> 00:50:08,356
You have money?

420
00:50:08,429 --> 00:50:09,862
Yes.

421
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:11,727
The King's letter.

422
00:50:15,436 --> 00:50:16,733
That won't do.

423
00:50:18,772 --> 00:50:20,239
You need money.

424
00:50:21,442 --> 00:50:22,374
A lot?

425
00:50:22,443 --> 00:50:23,569
Yes, a lot.

426
00:50:48,936 --> 00:50:50,904
Madam, l want money!

427
00:50:55,709 --> 00:50:57,074
Money.

428
00:51:26,206 --> 00:51:30,006
The last one of all!

429
00:51:30,077 --> 00:51:32,637
lt's always the best
of the--

430
00:51:35,382 --> 00:51:40,649
Like our love,
it's full of chances.

431
00:51:40,721 --> 00:51:43,315
The last one of all.

432
00:51:43,390 --> 00:51:46,757
Come dance the time away!

433
00:51:46,827 --> 00:51:49,421
We hears its call...

434
00:51:49,496 --> 00:51:53,091
And it lasts
till the end of day.

435
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:54,828
The music you hear...

436
00:51:54,902 --> 00:51:58,929
-is just for your ear.
-Look, Venus!

437
00:51:59,006 --> 00:51:59,938
Yes, Mama.

438
00:52:00,007 --> 00:52:02,100
The last one of all.

439
00:52:02,176 --> 00:52:03,905
Before we go--

440
00:52:17,224 --> 00:52:18,691
Mama, it's them !

441
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,994
Mama, it's them !

442
00:52:22,062 --> 00:52:24,997
We can't always smile...

443
00:52:25,065 --> 00:52:28,364
So when things go wrong--

444
00:52:31,905 --> 00:52:32,997
A next time?

445
00:52:33,073 --> 00:52:35,200
Shit, you've kissed me
enough!

446
00:52:48,055 --> 00:52:49,454
Hi, Cleopatra!

447
00:52:55,062 --> 00:52:57,360
Poor Ulysses.
What happened to you?

448
00:53:04,738 --> 00:53:08,037
Some bastard poked my eye out...

449
00:53:10,744 --> 00:53:12,871
when l kissed his daughter.

450
00:53:15,616 --> 00:53:16,548
Who cares?

451
00:53:16,617 --> 00:53:17,879
We're rich now!

452
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,384
Right. Who cares?

453
00:53:19,453 --> 00:53:20,477
We're rich!

454
00:53:23,457 --> 00:53:24,754
Yes! We're rich!

455
00:53:27,294 --> 00:53:29,091
We got
the world's treasures!

456
00:53:30,464 --> 00:53:32,898
Where are they?
l don't see anything.

457
00:53:32,966 --> 00:53:35,059
Me, neither.

458
00:53:35,135 --> 00:53:36,568
You got everything?

459
00:53:36,637 --> 00:53:37,729
Sure.

460
00:53:37,804 --> 00:53:39,567
Where is it?

461
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,904
l can't begin to tell ya.

462
00:53:41,975 --> 00:53:43,442
Where is it?

463
00:53:49,583 --> 00:53:50,550
lt's in there?!

464
00:53:50,617 --> 00:53:51,845
Yes, yes.

465
00:53:51,918 --> 00:53:54,546
You didn't bring a thing,
ya dumb vet!

466
00:53:54,621 --> 00:53:56,054
Cowards!

467
00:53:56,123 --> 00:53:57,055
Liar!

468
00:53:57,124 --> 00:53:58,716
Lazy slob!

469
00:53:58,792 --> 00:53:59,724
Deserter!

470
00:53:59,793 --> 00:54:01,090
Bastard!

471
00:54:02,296 --> 00:54:05,094
The war's not over yet,
and here they are!

472
00:54:34,194 --> 00:54:35,456
ln the suitcase...

473
00:54:35,529 --> 00:54:37,326

474
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:48,635

Coal, oil, etc.

481
00:54:58,518 --> 00:55:00,110

The 5 continents, the planets.

00:55:09,696 --> 00:55:11,459
Naturally...

486
00:55:11,531 --> 00:55:14,796
Naturally, each part is divided
into several parts.

487
00:55:14,868 --> 00:55:17,166
That are divided
into more parts.

488
00:55:36,089 --> 00:55:37,056
Order.

489

Method.

00:55:51,538 --> 00:55:52,971
Order and method!

491
00:55:53,039 --> 00:55:54,836
Our officer always said that.

492
00:56:01,214 --> 00:56:03,341
He died saying that.

493
00:56:06,586 --> 00:56:07,848
He died?

494
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:08,888
How?

495
00:56:14,428 --> 00:56:16,225
He blew up! Blam !

496
00:56:23,904 --> 00:56:25,030
Where do we start?

497
00:56:25,105 --> 00:56:26,037

The medals are a down payment
on your true gains.

700
01:07:25,498 --> 01:07:28,831
You can't really have...

701
01:07:28,901 --> 01:07:31,301
what you've earned...

702
01:07:31,370 --> 01:07:32,769
till the war's over.

703
01:07:35,475 --> 01:07:36,601
When'll that be?

704
01:07:37,643 --> 01:07:38,735
How'll we know that?

705
01:07:38,811 --> 01:07:40,108
There's nobody here.

706
01:07:44,917 --> 01:07:47,715
The war'll be over
when the King wins it.

707
01:07:49,455 --> 01:07:52,185
Then there'll be
shouts of joy...

708
01:07:52,258 --> 01:07:54,192
fireworks...

709
01:07:54,260 --> 01:07:55,352
firecrackers...

710
01:07:55,428 --> 01:07:58,397
and music so loud
you'll hear it even here.

711
01:08:00,933 --> 01:08:03,697
Then you'll get your earnings...

712
01:08:03,769 --> 01:08:07,535
at a special ceremony.

713
01:08:08,574 --> 01:08:09,632
Long live the King!

714
01:08:11,611 --> 01:08:12,737
Long live the King!

715
01:08:31,964 --> 01:08:35,092
Ulysses, see what
Michelangelo brought me!

716
01:08:45,077 --> 01:08:46,203
Venus!

717
01:08:48,414 --> 01:08:49,381
Venus!

718
01:08:50,683 --> 01:08:51,877
Look, Venus!

719
01:09:07,099 --> 01:09:08,896
Ulysses, look!

720
01:09:24,784 --> 01:09:26,581
Mama, quick!

721
01:09:28,788 --> 01:09:29,812
Look!

722
01:09:33,025 --> 01:09:33,957
The war's over!

723
01:09:34,026 --> 01:09:36,586
The war's over!

724
01:09:56,716 --> 01:09:58,274
Workers, citizens!

725
01:09:58,351 --> 01:10:01,752
Catastrophe
threatens the nation!

726
01:10:01,821 --> 01:10:03,914
Fight before you're attacked!

727
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:07,426
The break between republicans
and soldiers is final!

728
01:10:07,493 --> 01:10:10,462
Our enemies, the democrats...

729
01:10:31,517 --> 01:10:33,644
lt's on fire!
lt's burning!

730
01:10:50,803 --> 01:10:51,929
lt's on fire!

731
01:10:54,807 --> 01:10:56,604
Do you know where the King is?

732
01:11:14,527 --> 01:11:18,088
The Night of the Long Knives
is over!

733
01:11:18,164 --> 01:11:20,928
Tomorrow dawns
the satanic kingdom !

734
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:22,592
Workers, citizens!

735
01:11:22,668 --> 01:11:23,794
Long live the King!

736
01:11:37,850 --> 01:11:39,477
My washing machine!

737
01:11:52,631 --> 01:11:53,563
Your papers.

738
01:11:53,632 --> 01:11:54,724
Your papers.

739
01:11:58,137 --> 01:12:00,230
OK, beat it.

740
01:12:00,306 --> 01:12:01,273
Go.

741
01:12:15,254 --> 01:12:17,017
Workers, citizens!

742
01:12:17,089 --> 01:12:19,114
Listen to the cannons!

743
01:12:22,161 --> 01:12:23,753
Yes, it's worth it!

744
01:12:23,829 --> 01:12:25,456
Turn the cannons on them !

745
01:12:26,832 --> 01:12:31,269
Workers, citizens!
The day of liberty is here!

746
01:12:31,337 --> 01:12:32,929
Workers, citizens!

747
01:12:33,005 --> 01:12:34,905
l did nothing!

748
01:12:39,345 --> 01:12:40,471
Long live the King!

749
01:12:43,516 --> 01:12:44,744
Rifleman!

750
01:12:45,785 --> 01:12:46,717
Now what?

751
01:12:46,786 --> 01:12:47,718
Where's our treasure?

752
01:12:47,787 --> 01:12:48,913
l've no idea.

753
01:13:10,476 --> 01:13:11,443
Go around!

754
01:13:29,662 --> 01:13:30,629
Stop!

755
01:14:06,131 --> 01:14:07,098
The riflemen?

756
01:14:16,141 --> 01:14:17,506
Michelangelo!

757
01:14:32,725 --> 01:14:33,657
Hello, Sir!

758
01:14:33,726 --> 01:14:34,988
Now what?

759
01:14:35,060 --> 01:14:35,992
Where's our treasure?

760
01:14:36,061 --> 01:14:37,153
l've no idea.

761
01:14:39,398 --> 01:14:40,330
What?

762
01:14:40,399 --> 01:14:41,366
Why?

763
01:14:45,337 --> 01:14:46,634
l'll tell you.

764
01:14:48,173 --> 01:14:49,800
l'll tell you.

765
01:14:51,844 --> 01:14:53,778
We lost the war.

766
01:14:53,846 --> 01:14:55,780
The King made peace...

767
01:14:55,848 --> 01:14:57,816
but the cost was great.

768
01:14:59,184 --> 01:15:02,278
The enemy demanded the death
of the Prime Minister.

769
01:15:02,354 --> 01:15:05,118
The treaty demands...

770
01:15:05,190 --> 01:15:08,455
the arrest and punishment
of traitors...

771
01:15:08,527 --> 01:15:11,462
and war criminals.

772
01:15:11,530 --> 01:15:14,465
Moreover...
l have letters for you...

773
01:15:14,533 --> 01:15:15,500
from the King.

774
01:15:26,879 --> 01:15:28,346
l'll be right there.

775
01:15:31,216 --> 01:15:32,649
l've something to tell you.

776
01:15:32,718 --> 01:15:33,650
What?

777
01:15:33,719 --> 01:15:34,845
A secret!

778
01:15:44,597 --> 01:15:46,394
Henceforth...

779
01:15:46,465 --> 01:15:49,400
the 2 brothers slept
for eternity...

780
01:15:49,468 --> 01:15:54,235
believing the brain, in decay...

781
01:15:54,306 --> 01:15:59,073
functioned beyond death...

782
01:15:59,144 --> 01:16:03,080
and its dreams...

783
01:16:03,148 --> 01:16:07,414
are what constitute Paradise.
