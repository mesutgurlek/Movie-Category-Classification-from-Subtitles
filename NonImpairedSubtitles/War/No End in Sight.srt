1
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:20,044
The big respect that I profess{practise}
to his leadership, mister Presidente...

2
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:25,820
in this unincluded war
and stranger...

3
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:28,986
the first war of the XXIst century.

4
00:00:31,798 --> 00:00:34,926
Good is not known, it did not understand itself well...

5
00:00:35,001 --> 00:00:38,437
it turns out to be difficult to understand{comprise} it to the people...

6
00:00:38,505 --> 00:00:42,236
but I know with certain safety
that, with the time...

7
00:00:42,308 --> 00:00:47,143
his contributions
they will be registered in the history.

8
00:01:02,629 --> 00:01:04,927
NO END IN SIGHT


9
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,780
THANK YOU, the USA.

10
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:06,217
We condemn with hardness the criminal action
of the forces of the USA.

11
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:09,653
We are sorry about this catastrophe
to hands of the evil.

12
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:24,493
We demand the execution
of the unfaithful Wahabi

13
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:26,664
that receive support of the USA.

14
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:28,900
They have been arrested

15
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:33,071
and admitted his guilt
opposite to the presents.

16
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:36,582
We demand his execution.

17
00:03:38,918 --> 00:03:42,285
On May 1, 2003,
the president George W. Bush...

18
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:46,416
he{she} declared a high place in the operations
of combat of Iraq and he{she} said...

19
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:50,929
" In the war of Iraq, the USA.
and our Allied Forces have prevailed ".

20
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:19,519
Four years later, after 3.000 dead persons...

21
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:25,497
and 20.000 American injured men,
Iraq has disintegrated in the chaos.

22
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:28,830
Baghdad suffers from ten
to fifteen bombings a day...

23
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:29,901
ADVISER OF IRAQ IN THE OCCUPATION

24
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:32,370
... perhaps 50 deceased in act of service...

25
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:35,168
but I suspect
that about that does not speak to himself very much.

26
00:04:35,241 --> 00:04:39,143
Probably, only I came to us
a third of what happens actually.

27
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:42,204
Million Iraqis
they have no drinking water...

28
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:45,740
treatment of residual waters
not even electricity from the invasion.

29
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:47,911
Baghdad, with six million inhabitants...

30
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:52,185
she has been submitted to a curfew
from March, 2006.

31
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:56,490
More than three million Iraqis
they have fled to the nearby countries.

32
00:04:56,562 --> 00:05:01,761
It is estimated that the valuation{charge}
of civil deaths it promotes 600.000.

33
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:04,325
Those who die are lucky...

34
00:05:04,404 --> 00:05:05,404
IRAQI JOURNALIST IN the USA.

35
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,896
but those who live, are dead in life.

36
00:05:08,975 --> 00:05:12,342
The west and the north of Iraq
it is controlled by the insurgents.

37
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:13,572
MANAGER IN BAGHDAD

38
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:16,615
The rest of Iraq
it is controlled by the militias.

39
00:05:16,683 --> 00:05:21,382
Two Moslem principal groups,
the majority chiíta and the minority suní...

40
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,752
they are more and more conflicting.

41
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:26,191
They executed them for being suníes.

42
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:29,751
We were living together up to today.

43
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:35,563
It is an Iranian wave against us.
An Iranian wave.

44
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,695
We are Moslem. How is it possible?

45
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,638
They say that they are the Army of Mahdi.

46
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:43,266
Is this what this army does?

47
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:45,436
Look what it has obtained.

48
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,479
Open the shroud{mortise}, that see his face.

49
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:18,403
From January, 2003 until January, 2005...

50
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:20,844
I was a president
of the National Council of Intelligence.

51
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:27,341
We write the first estimation
national of the state{condition} of rebellion in Iraq.

52
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,944
It was bad news.

53
00:06:29,021 --> 00:06:32,889
It was presenting situations
bad, worse and the awful.

54
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,725
The president corrected it of guesswork
and his spokesman{spokeswoman} of press...

55
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:41,233
he{she} corrected it of insecurity
and opposition to the government.

56
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:45,327
What I gave to understand
the fact was that the president had not read it.

57
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:49,364
This is the history
of the invasion of Iraq for the USA.

58
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:58,882
In that many persons
they tried to save a nation.

59
00:07:13,132 --> 00:07:17,466
On September 11, 2001 it was
a beautiful clear and clear day.

60
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:19,835
It was returning of the hairdressing salon of the pentagon...

61
00:07:19,906 --> 00:07:21,203
THE DIRECTOR OF STRATEGIC POLITICS

62
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,471
... I happened{passed} for my office
and I threw{added} a glance to the TV set...

63
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:28,537
and I saw one of the towers twins in flames{llamas}.

64
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:32,117
SAFETY CHAMBER
OF THE PENTAGON

65
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:35,450
We do not hear to smash to the plane,
at least, I did not hear it.

66
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:39,548
Suddenly,
it was as if the Earth was opened.

67
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,855
I saw the fire-ball and, I must say...

68
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:45,386
that, on having seen her, I thought that
it would not go out hence lively.

69
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,333
The plane had smashed
under our office area.

70
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:50,801
The office of budget...

71
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:55,534
where 38 persons died,
it was just below...

72
00:07:55,608 --> 00:07:59,408
and the new center of control of the marina
it was two apartments further down.

73
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,448
There were no survivors
in these two sections.

74
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:05,450
This had to design his{her} Osama Bin Laden...

75
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:08,009
because another terrorist did not occur to me...

76
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,749
that could have organized something like that.

77
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,222
Did he{she} think it immediately?

78
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,781
Immediately.

79
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:19,298
One month after September 11,
The USA . invaded Afghanistan...

80
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:22,095
in search of Al Qaeda
and of Osama Bin Laden.

81
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,729
But before the war of Afghanistan,
some tall officials...

82
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,466
they were already chasing{prosecuting} another target...

83
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:31,271
one that had not anything in common
with the attacks of 11S.

84
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,744
When the attack of the pentagon,
I was in the building{edifice}.

85
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,075
EXPERT ANALYST OF IRAQ
INTELLIGENCE OF DEFENSE

86
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,548
I suppose that the following thing that happened...

87
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:42,384
the fact was that they assigned to us to look
immediately a relation...

88
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:45,049
between Saddam and Al Qaeda.

89
00:08:45,124 --> 00:08:50,289
I went to speak directly
with the group of antiterrorism...

90
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,092
with the analyst chief of Iraq.

91
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:54,655
The two met some days...

92
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:58,135
and we analyze all the historical reports
that we could find.

93
00:08:58,204 --> 00:08:59,432
Was CuáI his conclusion?

94
00:08:59,505 --> 00:09:02,030
We conclude that there was no relation.

95
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:07,671
His diet{regime} helps and protects terrorists,
including members of Al Qaeda.

96
00:09:07,747 --> 00:09:11,148
We watch the participation
of Iraq in terrorist activities.

97
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,208
What I want to highlight today...

98
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:17,484
it is the connection potentially
much more sinister between Iraq...

99
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,081
and the terrorist network of Al Qaeda.

100
00:09:19,158 --> 00:09:21,626
We do not want that of smoke of gun
pass to atomic cloud.

101
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,528
WRITER
Iraq is full of vagrants...

102
00:09:24,597 --> 00:09:26,155
they will put them in ships...

103
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,531
they will give them chemical biological weapon...

104
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:32,036
and they will order them flying
from the ships...

105
00:09:32,104 --> 00:09:34,436
to attack the east coast of the USA.

106
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:36,566
It is a fantastic world.

107
00:09:36,642 --> 00:09:39,611
I do not know what these people were smoking...

108
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,840
but it had to be of good quality.

109
00:09:41,914 --> 00:09:45,247
The circle of exterior{foreign} politics
of George W. Bush...

110
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,718
Cheney, Rumsfeld and Wolfowitz...

111
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:51,245
they directed the administration
towards the war of Iraq.

112
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,815
Condolezza Rice accompanied them.

113
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,724
Colin Powell and Richard Armitage...

114
00:09:55,795 --> 00:09:58,423
the only tall officials
with experience in combat...

115
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:02,695
they expressed his worries, but
they supported to the administration in public.

116
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:07,701
HISTORY

117
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,942
The advisers of Bush
they were treating with Saddam Hussein...

118
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,775
since éI was invading Iran in 1980...

119
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:17,839
in a brutal war that
it was paid by almost a million dead persons.

120
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,384
Iraq used chemical weapon...

121
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:23,081
against the military men
and the civil innocent Iranians.

122
00:10:23,155 --> 00:10:24,986
Saddam invested million dollars...

123
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,185
in programs of biological weapon,
chemical and nuclear...

124
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,923
while it was murdering 300.000
of your own citizens.

125
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,364
But the administration of Reagan,
being afraid to Iran...

126
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:38,460
he{she} attended to Saddam with military intelligence
and economic{economical} helps.

127
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,802
Donald Rumsfeld met
with Saddam in 1983.

128
00:10:41,874 --> 00:10:44,536
Colin Powell was the adviser
of national safety of Reagan...

129
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:47,101
from 1987 to 1989.

130
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:51,081
The 80s were summed up in the horrible one
although developer documented...

131
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:55,517
WRITER Y CATEDRÁTICA
... of the department of the state{condition} of 1987...

132
00:10:55,588 --> 00:11:01,959
that was saying that human rights
and chemical separate weapon, eat...

133
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,963
our interests
those will be equipped with Iraq.

134
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:09,022
The war between Iran and Iraq
it remained in deadlock in 1988.

135
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:13,028
THE FIRST WAR OF THE GULF
In 1990, Saddam invades Kuwait.

136
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,665
A coalition guided by the USA.
he{she} expels it in a war...

137
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:19,108
planned by Dick Cheney,
the secretary of that time of defense...

138
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,739
Paul Wolfowitz,
the undersecretary of that time of defense...

139
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:26,911
and Colin Powell, the of that time one
president of the joint staff.

140
00:11:26,986 --> 00:11:30,922
Bush senior incites the Iraqis
to a coup d'état against Saddam.

141
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:34,084
There is another way of stopping{detaining}
the blood effusion...

142
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:39,063
that the Iraqi army and the people{village}...

143
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:40,894
they take the justice as his hand...

144
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:45,096
and demolish the dictator Saddam Hussein.

145
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:47,639
But when the chiítas
of the south of Iraq they subset sail...

146
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,301
the administration stops
that Saddam squashes them.

147
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,868
14 of 18 Iraqi provinces...

148
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,641
AMBASSADOR DE IRAQ EN THE UNO
... the rebels were controlling them...

149
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:00,618
when general Schwartzkopf
it allowed Saddam Hussein...

150
00:12:00,686 --> 00:12:03,746
to use the helicopters of combat...

151
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:07,589
to massacre the rebels,
men, women and children.

152
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:10,720
The armistice of 1991
it is required that Iraq should disarm itself...

153
00:12:10,796 --> 00:12:13,321
but Saddam refuses.

154
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,594
It results in the fall
of the economy of Iraq...

155
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:19,104
for the sequestration of the UNO
that comes into force in 1993...

156
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:21,969
and that continues during
Clinton's administration.

157
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,441
The favored elite
for Saddam he{she} does not suffer it...

158
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,673
but the Iraqis of on foot
they rush to the extreme poverty...

159
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,444
and many{many people} come{turn}
to the Islamic fundamentalism.

160
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:35,009
In 1993, when
George Bush senior visits Kuwait...

161
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,884
Saddam tries to murder it.

162
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,689
Seven years later, his son
he is elected a president of the USA.

163
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:45,288
When you see the same architects
of political those...

164
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:46,729
on the one hand, speaking on...

165
00:12:46,799 --> 00:12:50,735
to straighten up what went out badly in 1991...

166
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:52,566
to finish what they began...

167
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:54,970
it was tantalizing to think
that had learned something.

168
00:12:56,342 --> 00:13:02,212
Saddam Hussein and his children
they must leave Iraq in 48 hours.

169
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:06,115
A denial
it would result in military conflict...

170
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:09,154
whose{which} beginning it is we who will decide.

171
00:13:09,255 --> 00:13:13,715
PRESIDENTIAL BOARD
OF NATIONAL SAFETY NUMBER 24

172
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:18,287
If the beginning wants to be dated
of the disaster of the postwar period of Iraq...

173
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:21,492
it would have to be January 20, 2003...

174
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:24,559
when Bush signed without, for what I know...

175
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,637
JOURNALIST AND WRITER

176
00:13:25,671 --> 00:13:29,107
... no real{royal} discussion
in the White House or the administration...

177
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:33,339
the presidential board
of national safety number 24...

178
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,813
that was granting the control of Iraq
to the Pentagon after the war.

179
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:39,851
This document did of Donald Rumsfeld...

180
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:42,547
the principal agent{reagent} in the postwar period of Iraq.

181
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,055
This war was conceived
for a limited{small} number of persons...

182
00:13:45,124 --> 00:13:46,148
THE DIRECTOR OF THE GROUP
OF INTERNATIONAL CRISIS

183
00:13:46,225 --> 00:13:48,420
... of the administration of Bush.

184
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:53,761
They had a vision
very ingenuous of what it was Iraq...

185
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:56,734
and of what the Iraqis
they would do on having fallen down the diet{regime}.

186
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,965
On having formulated his opinion
on Iraq after the fall of Saddam...

187
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:03,805
the administration rested{relied}
in a man called Ahmed Chalabi.

188
00:14:03,876 --> 00:14:06,436
From 1992,
Chalabi had been a president...

189
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,879
of the National Iraqi Congress, or CNI.

190
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,712
He{She} was not waking up confidence in general...

191
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:15,481
since Chalabi had been a reprobate
in Jordan for bank fraud.

192
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:18,648
The intelligence considered
his slightly trustworthy information...

193
00:14:18,724 --> 00:14:20,555
or even fraudulent.

194
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:24,426
Ideally,
they were lying...

195
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:26,828
and at the worst, they were inciting.

196
00:14:26,899 --> 00:14:28,366
If it was a source of the CNI...

197
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:34,270
the analysts were receiving it skeptics.

198
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,399
But it was not like that
for the creators of political.

199
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:38,500
Chalabi assured that the postwar period of Iraq...

200
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:41,410
it would be pro American
and easy to stabilize...

201
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,677
especially,
if the proper Chalabi was to the control.

202
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,048
So the plan was, in extract...

203
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:49,610
to be approximately three or four months...

204
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:53,749
to restore a government
exiles' compound...

205
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:56,818
with Ahmed Chalabi to the head...

206
00:14:56,896 --> 00:15:00,195
and, then, in August or September, 2003...

207
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:05,203
to begin the drastic one
reduction of the troops.

208
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,501
Larry Di Rita communicated to us
in a circular letter...

209
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,635
that at the end of August, 2003...

210
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:11,670
ANCIENT{FORMER} SPOKESMAN DE DEFENSA

211
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:15,340
... only they would stay
in Iraq from 25.000 to 30.000 troops.

212
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,542
I heard it saying it
in the persons' fourth full house...

213
00:15:18,617 --> 00:15:20,448
and I turned{became} to my companions...

214
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,384
and I said to them: " It is not known what he{she} says.

215
00:15:22,454 --> 00:15:24,445
" It is physically impossible ".

216
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:27,651
<i> The Future project of Iraq
of the department of the state{condition} ... </i>

217
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,194
a study of 13 volumes
on the postwar period of Iraq...

218
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:32,230
it was ignored by the Pentagon.

219
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:33,765
It was debated very much.

220
00:15:33,775 --> 00:15:34,775
THE DIRECTOR OF THE PROGRAM
OF NATIONAL SAFETY

221
00:15:34,778 --> 00:15:39,103
There were tons of volumes
on how should we do it.

222
00:15:39,171 --> 00:15:41,196
Almost not at all it integrated...

223
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:42,672
in the idea of the Pentagon.

224
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:43,765
My frustration...

225
00:15:43,842 --> 00:15:45,002
CHIEF OF STAFF
OF BREAD STICK POWELL

226
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,635
... and that of the secretary they grew...

227
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:50,842
on having seen our elegant planning,
our detailed planning...

228
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,213
completely discarded...

229
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,218
and to the people who had realized it...

230
00:15:54,286 --> 00:15:55,878
completely discarded...

231
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,617
so that the most loyal people...

232
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:02,286
in the line{figure} of the visions
of the republican party...

233
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:05,762
they could be renowned
for key positions in Iraq.

234
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:07,961
THE WAR

235
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:11,230
In this moment, the forces
of the coalition and those of EE.UU...

236
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:13,601
they begin
the military operations...

237
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:16,698
to disarm Iraq, to liberate his people...

238
00:16:16,775 --> 00:16:19,744
and to defend to the world of a serious danger.

239
00:16:43,102 --> 00:16:44,865
I joined the marina because he{she} believed...

240
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,928
that was an important work
and he{she} was thinking...

241
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:50,104
LIEUTENANT OF THE MARINA
that would not be happy in the life...

242
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:53,542
... knowing that another people
it had fought for my freedom.

243
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,076
I joined the army for...

244
00:16:55,147 --> 00:16:57,838
SPECIALIST, MILITARY POLICE OFFICER{POLICE} OF the USA.
... to support to my country...

245
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:03,183
and I thought that it was slightly positive.

246
00:17:03,255 --> 00:17:06,622
It was an honor...

247
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,692
GUNNER OF the USA.

248
00:17:07,726 --> 00:17:12,186
... to go out to help
to my welded partners...

249
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:17,099
to do what they say to us
that it is necessary to do...

250
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:23,233
perhaps to demolish a dictator...

251
00:17:23,308 --> 00:17:26,072
to restore a democracy.

252
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:32,510
He{She} was wishing it to begin
the war because it was...

253
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:36,986
the only beam of hope that it had...

254
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:42,460
and when it happened,
it was very moved.

255
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:45,156
The things would happen{pass} slowly...

256
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:48,495
but they would go towards one better future.

257
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,262
Thank you, mister Bush.

258
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:53,463
We like very much mister Bush!

259
00:17:53,539 --> 00:17:56,440
Not, not to Saddam! Yes, yes to Bush!

260
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:59,705
Not, not to Saddam! Yes, yes to Bush!

261
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,679
Look what it has done,

262
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:04,807
look what it has done to him to Iraq!

263
00:18:04,883 --> 00:18:10,515
It was a hopeful place,
frightened, noisy, confused...

264
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,489
quite mixed.

265
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:15,857
He{She} saw children with balaclava
that " FBI " were saying...

266
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:16,928
JOURNALIST IN BAGHDAD
FROM APRIL 15, 2003

267
00:18:16,995 --> 00:18:18,326
... and the thumbs were raising me.

268
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,365
And other young boys...

269
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:23,128
possibly, fedayines of civil...

270
00:18:23,202 --> 00:18:24,692
they were looking at me with hardness...

271
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,261
and they were evaluating me...

272
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:29,569
always looking at the registration{license plate} of the car.

273
00:18:29,641 --> 00:18:31,768
The Iraqis were hoping to see...

274
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:32,844
JOURNALIST AND WRITER
IN BAGHDAD FROM JULY, 2003

275
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:34,072
... what was going to bear them.

276
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:39,914
The presence of the USA still{yet} had not been
pushed back by the Iraqis.

277
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,681
Not to Saddam, not to Saddam!

278
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,951
I have seen the people receiving
the troops of the coalition...

279
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:50,893
because we think that
everything it was planned, prepared.

280
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:54,024
There they have it.

281
00:18:55,501 --> 00:18:57,765
During the Second World war,
the EE.UU...

282
00:18:57,836 --> 00:19:00,100
they started gliding
the occupation of Germany...

283
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,140
two years earlier...

284
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,675
but the administration of Bush
it did not create the organization...

285
00:19:04,743 --> 00:19:06,836
that would take charge
of the occupation of Iraq...

286
00:19:06,912 --> 00:19:10,040
up to 60 days before the invasion.

287
00:19:10,115 --> 00:19:13,050
The ORHA, the office
for the reconstruction...

288
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:15,109
and the humanitarian aid...

289
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:18,623
he{she} was reporting directly
to the secretary of defender Rumsfeld.

290
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:23,423
They called me from the office of the secretary
of defense at the end of January.

291
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,928
They wanted that I was taking charge...

292
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:27,456
MANAGER ORHA
... of humanitarian matters.

293
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:32,027
Jay Garner, general of the retired army,
it was chosen to direct the ORHA.

294
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:35,596
In the first War of the Gulf,
it had directed 22.000 soldiers...

295
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,699
in humanitarian operations...

296
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,643
in the Kurdish area of the north of Iraq.

297
00:19:40,712 --> 00:19:43,579
This time, he{she} would take charge of the whole country.

298
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,844
Was he considered prepared to direct Iraq?

299
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,582
I do not believe that never
we were prepared...

300
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:52,954
To prepare would take us years
a company of this magnitude.

301
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,322
Nobody had years.

302
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:55,917
They called me cellular me.

303
00:19:55,994 --> 00:19:57,052
SUPERVISED BY BAGHDAD FOR the USA.

304
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,063
It was someone of the department of the state{condition}...

305
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:01,964
saying to me
that Rich Armitage was looking for me...

306
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:05,094
and he{she} wanted that it was returning
to Washington immediately.

307
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,662
Ambassadress Barbara Bodine
it put itself supervised by Baghdad...

308
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:10,799
only three weeks before the war.

309
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,776
She was a diplomatic official
with experience...

310
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:14,812
that had served in Yemen, Iraq...

311
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,371
and that had been a hostage
in Kuwait five months...

312
00:20:17,449 --> 00:20:19,849
after the invasion of Saddam in 1990.

313
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,580
It belonged to few experts
in the Middle East...

314
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:25,452
that the Pentagon ordered Iraq.

315
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:28,084
One of the few ones.
I believed that they had been wrong...

316
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,786
UNDERSECRETARY OF THE STATE{CONDITION}
They believed that it would be easy to handle...

317
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,989
Pero Barbara is
of the hardest of the service.

318
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,693
In 2003, colonel Paul Hughes...

319
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:37,667
it was taking in the Pentagon 6 years...

320
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,260
in works of planning and strategy...

321
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:41,533
for expert officials of Defense.

322
00:20:41,607 --> 00:20:43,336
I ended up by being destined...

323
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:47,708
to the office of reconstruction
and humanitarian aid...

324
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:48,871
with Jay Garner.

325
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:51,677
I was his director of strategic politics.

326
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:58,656
The ORHA started working in
the Pentagon 50 days before the invasion.

327
00:20:58,724 --> 00:21:01,215
They gave us an office complex...

328
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,057
that was taking an unoccupied pair{couple} of years...

329
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:06,927
there were no computers,
the people were coming every day...

330
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:08,398
and he{she} was asking: " Where do I feel? ".

331
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:11,561
There was no personnel.

332
00:21:11,637 --> 00:21:16,700
It did not even have a secretary.

333
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,403
Only there was a meeting
in the University of National Defense...

334
00:21:19,478 --> 00:21:22,311
and I believe that the unanimous opinion...

335
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,508
of the people who was present at this meeting...

336
00:21:24,583 --> 00:21:27,484
with that I spoke then...

337
00:21:27,552 --> 00:21:30,817
it was: " This is a madness ".

338
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,084
It was our first meeting...

339
00:21:33,158 --> 00:21:35,888
and they were not offering us
too much safety...

340
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,326
because, basically...

341
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:39,864
the only thing that we did was to meet us.

342
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:42,991
It was not structured at all.

343
00:21:43,068 --> 00:21:47,368
There were no plans. None by no means.

344
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:51,705
On March 16, the ORHA
one displaced Kuwait.

345
00:21:51,777 --> 00:21:54,678
167 persons accompanied us.

346
00:21:54,746 --> 00:21:57,442
167 persons who would turn...

347
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:00,610
in the government of a country of 25 millions.

348
00:22:01,186 --> 00:22:04,713
BAGHDAD, ON APRIL 9, 2003

349
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,189
After the fall of Baghdad...

350
00:22:06,258 --> 00:22:08,226
we did not know what was going to happen...

351
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:10,887
and it was obvious that it had not glided at all.

352
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:12,827
What they were telling us...

353
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,025
the fact was that we would embark...

354
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:18,695
after one or two months of,
basically, to conquer Iraq.

355
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:22,797
When the troops of the USA entered
in the capital, they began the plundering.

356
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:28,272
In Kuwait...

357
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,578
we were so given
to the TV set as the others.

358
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:37,318
We realized
of that he{she} was reigning the disorder...

359
00:22:37,389 --> 00:22:39,949
and the chaos in Iraq.

360
00:22:42,461 --> 00:22:44,190
The Americans were not doing anything.

361
00:22:44,262 --> 00:22:47,026
They were stopping in intersections...

362
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,727
but they were not going down the vehicles...

363
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,632
or of the tanks to do nothing.

364
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:58,001
The time was happening{passing}
and we did not see any progress.

365
00:22:58,076 --> 00:23:01,443
The only progress
it was the uncontrolled freedom.

366
00:23:01,513 --> 00:23:05,005
The looters wanted to come
to all the buildings{edifices} of the government...

367
00:23:05,083 --> 00:23:07,415
and even to private companies.

368
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:11,923
The plundering stemmed partly
at the level of the troops...

369
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:16,427
and to the sensation that Rumsfeld
it transmitted his commanders...

370
00:23:16,495 --> 00:23:21,125
and these to his subordinates...

371
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:27,434
of that we were not there
to govern Iraq...

372
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,100
but to eliminate the diet{regime} and to go out.

373
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,540
We are not under the martial law.

374
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,634
COMMANDER DE THE ALLIED FORCES

375
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:35,509
It was not ordained general McKiernan...

376
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,071
that was establishing the martial law.

377
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,812
The martial law never declared itself.

378
00:23:40,886 --> 00:23:43,855
We are in a process
of transition, sincerely...

379
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:48,120
there is a civil law in Iraq, but there is not...

380
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:52,653
They already heard that the first two courts
they were opened today...

381
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,995
so, when it is begun from zero...

382
00:23:55,066 --> 00:23:56,499
With the martial law...

383
00:23:56,568 --> 00:24:00,595
that the fourth Convention of Geneva
he{she} would have authorized...

384
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:04,130
perhaps there would have been more safety.

385
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:05,972
We are a marines' section...

386
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:08,069
we might have detained the plundering...

387
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:09,704
if they had arranged it to us.

388
00:24:09,781 --> 00:24:13,046
The big mystery of the Iraqi postwar period...

389
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,348
it is why in one month
after the fall of Baghdad...

390
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,546
NATIONAL PUBLISHER

391
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,088
... the USA did not do anything...

392
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:20,681
to control the plundering, because...

393
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:22,852
all the problems since then...

394
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,225
they began the first month.

395
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,287
The Council of National Safety...

396
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:28,332
the secretary of Powell, I and others...

397
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:32,166
the director of the CIA, we express
our worries for the plundering.

398
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,501
Did he{she} speak with the president Bush?

399
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:37,440
I was present at the meeting
in that my chief commented on it to himself.

400
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:39,204
What did mister Powell say?

401
00:24:39,277 --> 00:24:41,438
This is not our way of acting.

402
00:24:41,513 --> 00:24:44,682
Our advices{councils} to the president
they are private.

403
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,717
From Washington it was said...

404
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,309
that we would not interfere...

405
00:24:48,386 --> 00:24:50,251
that we would not detain the plundering...

406
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,483
that we would not be police officers...

407
00:24:52,557 --> 00:24:55,526
this is not what we came to do. I think...

408
00:24:55,594 --> 00:24:59,360
There were instructions
explicit from Washington...

409
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,058
not to interfere in the plundering?

410
00:25:01,132 --> 00:25:02,190
Yes.

411
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,800
The plundering of Baghdad
soon they transformed

412
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:09,034
in a destruction of the city
on a large scale violent and organized.

413
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:13,908
Hospitals, governmental offices,
universities, departments...

414
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:17,574
The provisional authority estimated
the losses in the plundering...

415
00:25:17,649 --> 00:25:20,743
in 12.000 million dollars.

416
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:26,314
The same as the government debts of Iraq
in the year 2003-2004.

417
00:25:26,391 --> 00:25:30,293
I bought a periodic today
and I remained surprised.

418
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,627
I read eight holders who were speaking of...

419
00:25:33,698 --> 00:25:37,065
" Chaos! Violence! Discomfort! ".

420
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:40,104
It sounds as if it us was going away
to fall down the world above.

421
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:42,696
Imagine the quarter{room}
where we were seated...

422
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:46,437
and only you see cement walls,
nothing stays.

423
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:50,106
We speak about the people who comes
with industrial cranes...

424
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:53,742
and it takes parts of a power plant.

425
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:55,547
Compare it with our cities...

426
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:59,716
when there have been disturbances,
problems and plundering.

427
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:02,259
These things happen{pass}!

428
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,557
There were no thefts in the shops.

429
00:26:04,629 --> 00:26:09,396
They were the people limiting walls to fine sand{gravel}...

430
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:10,957
to take a beam.

431
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:12,867
The images that they see in television...

432
00:26:12,938 --> 00:26:15,702
there are the repeated same...

433
00:26:15,774 --> 00:26:18,368
and it is the same image of someone...

434
00:26:18,443 --> 00:26:20,775
that goes out of a building{edifice} with a vase.

435
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:24,178
I believe that this was the day
in that we lost the Iraqis.

436
00:26:24,649 --> 00:26:27,675
And you think: " Golly!
Were there so many vases? ".

437
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:33,715
It is possible that there was
so many vases in the whole country?

438
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,523
It is when it became clear...

439
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:40,827
that this liberation did not have
nothing to see with the Iraqis.

440
00:26:40,899 --> 00:26:42,161
One believed that the EE.UU...

441
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:44,861
they incited the plundering, or that was his desire.

442
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:46,028
JOURNALIST
IN BAGHDAD FROM APRIL, 2003

443
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:48,038
The destruction of our country...

444
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:49,596
how could they allow it?

445
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,539
Be already suní or chiíta...

446
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,202
the plundering was contracting you.

447
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,772
We did a list of 20 places...

448
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,215
that we believed had to be protected...

449
00:27:00,285 --> 00:27:04,949
for history, culture, art or religion.

450
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,048
We send it...

451
00:27:07,125 --> 00:27:10,356
but not surtió no effect.

452
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:16,128
The Department of the Oil was the only one
installation protected by the USA.

453
00:27:16,201 --> 00:27:22,436
None was protected
of the places of the list of the ORHA.

454
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,873
The National Museum of Iraq in Baghdad...

455
00:27:24,943 --> 00:27:26,604
the number one of the list of the ORHA...

456
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:29,238
it was containing some
of the most important objects...

457
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,612
of the ancient civilizations.

458
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:33,878
The museum was never protected.

459
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:36,113
It is a property of our nation,

460
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:38,849
and the treasure of 7.000 years of civilization.

461
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,390
Why do they allow it?

462
00:27:40,458 --> 00:27:43,450
The National Library
and the National File of Iraq...

463
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:46,964
that were containing thousands of manuscripts
ancient they were set fire.

464
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:51,332
Quite what he{she} writes himself or he{she} wrote himself...

465
00:27:51,403 --> 00:27:53,837
he{she} was keeping in this library.

466
00:27:53,905 --> 00:27:58,103
We already have no national heritage.

467
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,976
Three days ago, the doctor Jabar Khalil...

468
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:04,811
president of the Council of Antiquities,
and I...

469
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:10,014
we went to the headquarters
of the marines in the Hotel Palestine.

470
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,181
We wait more than four hours...

471
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:14,555
until a colonel received us.

472
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:19,290
Then, he{she} promised us
that would order armored cars...

473
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:23,357
to protect the remains of the museum.

474
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:26,495
This was three days ago, nobody came.

475
00:28:26,571 --> 00:28:30,871
To try to make responsible
it is unfortunate...

476
00:28:30,942 --> 00:28:32,876
activity...

477
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,469
in the defects of a plan of war...

478
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,276
it looks like to me an exaggeration.

479
00:28:37,348 --> 00:28:42,012
They did not receive notices
of academicians between others...

480
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,578
on the danger of the museum?
There for were not asked they...

481
00:28:44,656 --> 00:28:47,318
to provide
more safety and protection...

482
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:49,292
in the initial phases of the operation?

483
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,418
That I know, not.

484
00:28:50,495 --> 00:28:52,122
They cannot say that the plundering...

485
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,528
they took them as a surprise.

486
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:55,532
I believe that they did not want to know it.

487
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,692
They did not want to hear it.

488
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:14,845
In the months before the invasion...

489
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:17,319
the debate on how many troops
Iraq would be sent...

490
00:29:17,388 --> 00:29:18,616
it was supported privately...

491
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:22,217
between the military leaders
and Donald Rumsfeld.

492
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,659
Rumsfeld and his undersecretary,
Paul Wolfowitz...

493
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,425
they believed that a force
of less than 100.000 troops...

494
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,591
it would be sufficient...

495
00:29:28,666 --> 00:29:31,430
for the invasion and occupation of Iraq.

496
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,061
One month before the invasion...

497
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:35,265
the dispute{argument} on the troops went out to the light...

498
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,309
when the Chief of Staff
of the army, Eric Shinseki...

499
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:40,901
he{she} testified before the Committee
of Services Armed{Assembled} with the Senate...

500
00:29:40,979 --> 00:29:43,243
ignoring the pressure
of Rumsfeld and of Wolfowitz.

501
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:46,112
General Shinseki...

502
00:29:46,184 --> 00:29:48,778
it can indicate us the magnitude...

503
00:29:48,853 --> 00:29:53,017
of forces of the army necessary
for the occupation of Iraq?

504
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:57,152
About several
hundreds of thousands of soldiers...

505
00:29:57,228 --> 00:30:02,928
they might be necessary.

506
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:04,901
The reaction was immediate.

507
00:30:05,303 --> 00:30:08,033
What is clear here...

508
00:30:08,106 --> 00:30:11,473
the fact is that to think that they are needed
hundreds of thousands of soldiers...

509
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:13,841
I believe that it leaves of the logic.

510
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:16,472
It is inconceivable
that need more forces...

511
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:19,449
to stabilize Iraq
after the fall of Saddam...

512
00:30:19,517 --> 00:30:21,610
that to carry out the proper war...

513
00:30:21,686 --> 00:30:24,052
and to assure the capitulation
of the forces of Saddam...

514
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:27,057
and his army. Difficult to imagine.

515
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,719
Difficult to imagine.

516
00:30:29,794 --> 00:30:32,763
Anyone that has experience...

517
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:37,530
in the interventions in the 90s
it was known that it is precisely the opposite.

518
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:42,505
So many soldiers are needed
for every thousand inhabitants...

519
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:47,477
simply to provide
a safety minimum.

520
00:30:47,545 --> 00:30:49,604
Pero Paul Wolfowitz was not imagining it.

521
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:53,742
Paul Wolfowitz refused
to be interviewed for this documentary.

522
00:30:53,818 --> 00:30:57,151
We speak of hostilidades later{posterior}...

523
00:30:57,222 --> 00:31:01,955
control on
a big part of the geography...

524
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:06,292
with a class of ethnic tension...

525
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:09,925
that might cause problems...

526
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:13,732
and that's why it is needed
great presence of forces of ground.

527
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,295
Was general Shinseki right?

528
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,605
TRAINER{COACH} OF THE NEW ARMY OF IRAQ
His best military opinion was asked him...

529
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,734
and it has more experience than I.

530
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,371
He was a commander
of our forces in Bosnia...

531
00:31:22,447 --> 00:31:27,077
it did it during more than one year...
He{She} knows about what he{she} speaks.

532
00:31:27,151 --> 00:31:31,019
Secretary Powell and I...

533
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,886
we were fighting to order more troops...

534
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:35,721
and we obtain something, but in the end...

535
00:31:35,793 --> 00:31:38,284
it was not sufficient.

536
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:42,329
Rumsfeld ended up by sending
160.000 troops to Iraq.

537
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,527
I believe that the war would be different...

538
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,900
if there was...

539
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,633
a leadership that it understood...

540
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:53,006
first, which is to be
in the area of the combat...

541
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:55,773
that has served in the armed forces...

542
00:31:55,847 --> 00:32:00,477
and, second, which had talent of control...

543
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,382
to do that this works.

544
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:04,114
The tall officials...

545
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:06,679
that deprived of authority the army
and to the department of the state{condition}...

546
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,454
they had no experience in
reconstruction of postwar period...

547
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,859
and almost no military experience.

548
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:14,558
Cheney avoided
the military service in Vietnam...

549
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:16,793
with five postponements of incorporation.

550
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:21,328
Rumsfeld was a pilot of the marines
in 1950, but it never fought.

551
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:24,375
Wolfowitz and Never curl
they had served in the army.

552
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:26,637
Bush avoided to go to Vietnam...

553
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:29,179
joining
to the Air Guardsman{National Guard} of Texas.

554
00:32:29,247 --> 00:32:33,775
Neither it had experience in politics
exterior before being a president.

555
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,443
We were looking at it and...

556
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,250
that we have military experience...

557
00:32:38,323 --> 00:32:40,883
and we were commenting on it often...

558
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,722
we knew that it was not well.

559
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:46,321
In April, 2003,
with the plundering still without controlling...

560
00:32:46,397 --> 00:32:49,798
Rumsfeld cancelled the deployment
of the first division of knighthood{cavalry}...

561
00:32:49,867 --> 00:32:51,892
a force of 16.000 soldiers.

562
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,736
We surprised it.
How can you cancel this division?

563
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:59,766
If this division
it had followed us to Iraq...

564
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:02,005
we could have stabilized Iraq...

565
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,911
with our presence only.

566
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:07,509
On April 19,
the ORHA entered finally Iraq...

567
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:10,179
to begin
the operations of postwar period.

568
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:12,688
Of 20 departments
that we wanted to re-use...

569
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:14,247
16 had been destroyed...

570
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:16,020
because of the plundering.

571
00:33:16,594 --> 00:33:18,084
We were beginning from zero.

572
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:20,289
If there do not stay tables, chairs...

573
00:33:20,365 --> 00:33:21,889
typewriters...

574
00:33:21,966 --> 00:33:26,062
where will we receive the Iraqis
to start working?

575
00:33:26,137 --> 00:33:28,332
Structures were not staying...

576
00:33:28,406 --> 00:33:30,306
physical or bureaucratic structures.

577
00:33:30,375 --> 00:33:31,774
I had to discover the people...

578
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,572
asking round there: " Do you know to ...?

579
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,009
" Do you know to anybody of Health?

580
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:36,774
" Do you know to anybody of the Interior?

581
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:38,975
" Do you know to anybody of Education? ".

582
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:43,510
Inside the proper group, there was...

583
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:48,116
I believe that five who should know something about Arab{Arabic}.

584
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,251
We did not have lists of phones...

585
00:33:50,328 --> 00:33:51,727
we had no phone a time...

586
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:54,663
so I suppose that these lists
they were not so important.

587
00:33:54,732 --> 00:33:57,030
We had no information not to where to go...

588
00:33:57,101 --> 00:33:58,830
we did not know with whom contacting.

589
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:01,736
It is not the best form...

590
00:34:01,806 --> 00:34:04,001
It is not the best form
of beginning an occupation.

591
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:08,205
It was following{continued} a feeling of disorder...

592
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:09,769
of that Iraq never recovered.

593
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,405
The armed people took the control...

594
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:13,074
they were Iraqi with weapon.

595
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:18,083
THE GAP

596
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:23,861
The shootings that I the vi.th..

597
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:27,022
they were not American
being irresolute...

598
00:34:27,098 --> 00:34:29,293
but Iraqis shooting Iraqis.

599
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:31,392
You were going in car for the street and suddenly...

600
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:34,836
it begins a wave
of shots on your head...

601
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,635
and you are in the middle of these types...

602
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:37,867
going off some others.

603
00:34:37,942 --> 00:34:39,842
The streets were a chaos...

604
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:42,243
the people were killing and doing not spending{passing} anything...

605
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:44,178
there was no police officer{police} of service.

606
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,113
Just before the invasion...

607
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,550
Saddam had released
to 100.000 prisoners...

608
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:51,110
common criminals, of the jails.

609
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:58,557
In February, 2003...

610
00:34:58,629 --> 00:35:01,598
they invited me to report
to the advisers' panel...

611
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,224
that was advising Rumsfeld...

612
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:05,360
on matters of political of defense.

613
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:06,562
I said to them that...

614
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:07,637
THE DIRECTOR,
CRIMINAL INTERNATIONAL JUSTICE

615
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,765
... basing on our experience...

616
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:12,935
and in the history of Iraq...

617
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,808
it was very probable that
if the USA was intervening...

618
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,313
and it was capturing Baghdad...

619
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:20,350
we would face
to civil massive disturbances.

620
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:23,910
I suggested that we needed
approximately 2500 forces of police officer{police}...

621
00:35:23,988 --> 00:35:27,515
approximately 4.000 civil police officers in the street...

622
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:31,119
and teams{equipments} of judicial advisers
and officials of prisons.

623
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:34,756
In the end, they coincided
in that it was a good idea...

624
00:35:34,832 --> 00:35:38,700
but that there was no time,
perhaps for the next war.

625
00:35:38,769 --> 00:35:41,237
Before the war,
the mortuary of Baghdad...

626
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:42,897
it was receiving a murder a month.

627
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,636
In one month, approximately 25 were coming to them a day.

628
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,678
Violations, sometimes for the first time...

629
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:48,769
violations and murders.

630
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:50,711
They were kidnapping Iraqi girls.

631
00:35:50,781 --> 00:35:52,305
The women were disappearing...

632
00:35:52,383 --> 00:35:54,874
they stopped going to the school, driving.

633
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:57,944
The Americans
they were not doing of police officers.

634
00:35:58,022 --> 00:36:00,582
They did not know the streets,
they were not speaking the language...

635
00:36:00,658 --> 00:36:03,593
they did not have sufficient interpreters...

636
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:06,892
they had no information
on what it was happening{passing}...

637
00:36:06,964 --> 00:36:08,864
so it was a pitched battle...

638
00:36:08,933 --> 00:36:11,800
you were feeling that there was a gap.

639
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,447
Very soon, the mosque filled this gap...

640
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:27,245
that EE.UU created...

641
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,377
on having eliminated Saddam
and not to put anything in his place.

642
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:32,752
In the quarters chiítas,
soon they established the control...

643
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:35,485
especially, the clergymen
associated with Muqtada to the-Sadr.

644
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:38,791
Muqtada to the-Sadr was the son
of a famous clergyman chiíta...

645
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:41,764
and it began his ascent to the power
being based on the network of his father...

646
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:43,823
of mosques and charity organizations.

647
00:36:43,901 --> 00:36:48,838
As I said, the small Satan has gone away,

648
00:36:48,906 --> 00:36:52,967
and the big Satan has come.

649
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:57,978
The exit{departure} of the occupation and his retreat

650
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:00,916
it is the victory of Iraq and of the Iraqis.

651
00:37:00,985 --> 00:37:03,920
Only a few days later
of that the USA will enter Baghdad...

652
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:07,116
it murdered a leader chiíta
pro American.

653
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:11,287
It started creating an armed militia,
the Army of Mahdi...

654
00:37:11,362 --> 00:37:13,557
that took the control
of the ghetto chiíta of Baghdad...

655
00:37:13,631 --> 00:37:15,326
and almost all the south of Iraq.

656
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:18,095
If we deal
of the matters of alertness...

657
00:37:18,169 --> 00:37:19,830
if there had not been plundering...

658
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,464
there would not have been sectarian militias...

659
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,532
as safety source in the quarters.

660
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:28,602
The ORHA strained
in remembering the Iraqi army...

661
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:30,874
that will deal with the safety.

662
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:34,884
The central control of the army,
CENTCOM, supported this measurement.

663
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:37,580
The CENTCOM included in his plan...

664
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:39,020
to re-restore the Iraqi army.

665
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,819
They used it to seal the borders...

666
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,189
to contribute static safety...

667
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:45,388
and to help to reconstruct
your own nation.

668
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:49,361
But on April 23, 2003,
Jay Garner received a call.

669
00:37:49,433 --> 00:37:51,526
Rumsfeld called me and said...

670
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:53,661
" I like everything what it is spending{passing}.

671
00:37:53,738 --> 00:37:55,672
" They are doing a big work.

672
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,640
" I am glad that they are
in Baghdad, certainly...

673
00:37:57,708 --> 00:38:00,905
" the president
it has named Jerry Bremer...

674
00:38:00,978 --> 00:38:02,343
" presidential envoy ".

675
00:38:02,413 --> 00:38:05,109
MANAGER,
PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY

676
00:38:05,182 --> 00:38:07,946
Bremer was
an ancient{former} diplomatic official.

677
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,577
As other officials...

678
00:38:09,654 --> 00:38:11,246
Bremer was not speaking Arabic...

679
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:13,483
it had no experience in the Middle East...

680
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:15,616
or in reconstruction of postwar period...

681
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:17,854
and it had never served in the army.

682
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:21,194
After the arrival of Bremer,
the ORHA would move back{retire} progressively...

683
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:24,132
and the Authority
Provisional of the Coalition, the CPA...

684
00:38:24,201 --> 00:38:26,032
it would take his place.

685
00:38:26,103 --> 00:38:29,334
We want to do a delivery
very effective and efficient...

686
00:38:29,407 --> 00:38:30,407
BREMER COMES TO BAGHDAD

687
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:34,104
... and organized well.

688
00:38:34,178 --> 00:38:38,046
General Garner and I we are
promised to be employed at team{equipment}.

689
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:39,377
It has done a big work.

690
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:41,111
We inform it about everything...

691
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:43,119
one day passed seeing
what was each one doing...

692
00:38:43,187 --> 00:38:44,745
and, then, it took the control.

693
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:47,188
I returned to house 3, 4 or on June 5.

694
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:52,187
THE REBELLION OF BREMER

695
00:38:52,930 --> 00:38:56,161
Between May 1 and May 10,
when it went out towards Iraq...

696
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,562
Bremer was employed at the Pentagon...

697
00:38:57,635 --> 00:39:00,729
and he{she} met often
with Rumsfeld, Wolfowitz...

698
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:03,273
and the undersecretary Doug Feith.

699
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:06,105
Bremer also worked
with Walter Slocombe...

700
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,042
ancient{former} undersecretary of Defense...

701
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:11,604
whom Rumsfeld entrusted
the politics of postwar period...

702
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:13,081
for the Iraqi army.

703
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:16,085
They called me in the middle of May, 2003.

704
00:39:16,153 --> 00:39:18,144
He{She} thought in some moment...

705
00:39:18,222 --> 00:39:21,350
what was a little late to think about that?

706
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:22,687
ADVISER FOR DEFENSE
AND NATIONAL SAFETY

707
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,489
Yes.

708
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,392
Was it said to them?

709
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:30,024
Not.

710
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,227
As Bremer...

711
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:33,293
Slocombe had not served in the army...

712
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,668
it had not gone to Iraq...

713
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:37,230
it had no experience
in reconstruction of postwar period...

714
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,742
and he{she} was not speaking Arabic.

715
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,710
In the first 10 days
of work of Bremer...

716
00:39:41,779 --> 00:39:43,440
still{yet} in Washington...

717
00:39:43,514 --> 00:39:46,347
it took three fatidical decisions.

718
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:49,011
The first one was to stop{detain} the formation...

719
00:39:49,086 --> 00:39:51,054
of a provisional Iraqi government...

720
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:54,023
although Jay Garner
it had worked to establish it.

721
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:55,319
Jay Garner was in favor...

722
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,361
of forming an Iraqi government...

723
00:39:57,428 --> 00:40:02,161
but Baghdad was suppressed of way...

724
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,394
and I do not believe that
general Garner knew it...

725
00:40:04,468 --> 00:40:06,129
not I neither.

726
00:40:06,203 --> 00:40:12,073
We were waiting, and he{she} might say
that promised us...

727
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:14,236
that there would be a sovereign government...

728
00:40:14,311 --> 00:40:15,801
almost immediately.

729
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:22,308
" I am in charge and all
they will obey me. That is quite.

730
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:23,444
" Understood? ".

731
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:25,989
This way it was like...

732
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:27,921
L. Paul Bremer It appeared.

733
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:33,123
Too loyal and too much
dependent on his mission...

734
00:40:33,197 --> 00:40:36,894
to notice that his prompt exclusion
of the Iraqis...

735
00:40:36,967 --> 00:40:39,731
of the process of capture of decisions...

736
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,169
it was a catastrophic error.

737
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:46,301
L. Paul Bremer He{She} refused
to be interviewed for this documentary.

738
00:40:46,377 --> 00:40:51,178
In May, 2003 we had
the legal occupation of Iraq.

739
00:40:51,248 --> 00:40:53,478
In that moment I said it, and now I believe...

740
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:56,076
that was an error.

741
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,313
We want that EE.UU...

742
00:40:57,388 --> 00:40:59,322
leave Iraq completely...

743
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:02,848
and that allow to the Iraqi people to govern Iraq.

744
00:41:02,927 --> 00:41:04,986
The reaction against
his following decisions...

745
00:41:05,062 --> 00:41:06,188
it would be worse enough.

746
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:09,926
Desbaazificación.

747
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,664
I restore today an Iraqi commission
for the desbaazificación...

748
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:17,571
so that the structure and the influence...

749
00:41:17,641 --> 00:41:19,871
of the party Baaz
they are eliminated forever.

750
00:41:19,944 --> 00:41:21,206
His second decision...

751
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:24,111
his first formal order
at the head of the CPA...

752
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:27,548
it eliminated approximately 50.000 members
of the party Baaz...

753
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:30,109
that Saddam had used
to govern Iraq.

754
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:33,714
For the majority, the order of Bremer
he{she} supposed the permanent unemployment.

755
00:41:33,791 --> 00:41:36,021
Also it paralyzed the Iraqi government...

756
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,323
the educational system and the economy...

757
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:40,295
on having eliminated expert officials...

758
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:41,388
that joined the party...

759
00:41:41,465 --> 00:41:44,127
only to survive
to the diet{regime} of Saddam.

760
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:46,226
Ambassadress Robin Raphel...

761
00:41:46,303 --> 00:41:47,736
he{she} said to me: " Have you seen this? ".

762
00:41:47,805 --> 00:41:48,965
I said: " What happens{passes}? ".

763
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,030
" Desbaazificación ".

764
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,303
I read it superficially and said...

765
00:41:53,377 --> 00:41:55,106
" I believe that we will not be able to do it ".

766
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:57,409
He{She} said: " I believe that it is necessary to speak with Jerry ".

767
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,210
We went to see it and I said...

768
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:00,750
" Allow us to deal...

769
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:02,217
" to call Rumsfeld...

770
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:03,480
" to smooth it ".

771
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,488
He said: " I do not have this flexibility.

772
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,217
" I have orders that to fulfill ".

773
00:42:07,291 --> 00:42:08,781
The discussion was finished.

774
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,987
Perhaps he{she} was coming to speak with me
in some moment...

775
00:42:12,062 --> 00:42:13,859
I do not remember it, really that not.

776
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,899
He{She} does not remember that these people were saying...

777
00:42:15,966 --> 00:42:18,264
- " are they from 30 to 50.000 persons "?
- It can that yes.

778
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:19,335
" What do you do? "

779
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,860
I alone...

780
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:23,338
It was working 20 hours a day
at that time.

781
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:26,205
It was not the only thing that it had to do...

782
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:28,108
in my first five days to the charge.

783
00:42:28,178 --> 00:42:30,078
Bremer named Ahmed Chalabi...

784
00:42:30,147 --> 00:42:32,479
chief of the commission of desbaazificación.

785
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:35,781
Chalabi centred
in political rivals eliminate.

786
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:38,151
The desbaazificación was so deep...

787
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,452
that we could not
to start the government...

788
00:42:40,524 --> 00:42:42,185
in an effective way...

789
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,385
not with rapidity...

790
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,827
and there were many baazistas
without right to vote.

791
00:42:46,897 --> 00:42:48,194
For what do we ask?

792
00:42:48,265 --> 00:42:49,289
I work! I work!

793
00:42:49,366 --> 00:42:52,358
He{She} was beginning{throwing himself} to the people of his employments{jobs}...

794
00:42:52,436 --> 00:42:55,872
although they were only professionals...

795
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,339
PROFESSOR OF HISTORY
ANCIENT{FORMER} ADVISER OF BUSH

796
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,205
... engineers, the directors.

797
00:42:59,276 --> 00:43:01,972
The technocrats, the intelligence...

798
00:43:02,046 --> 00:43:04,879
the librarians of school.

799
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,213
That conquer you and to lose your employment{job}...

800
00:43:07,284 --> 00:43:09,684
to have no means
to support your family...

801
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,415
it was a very humiliating experience.

802
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,819
But it was the third decision...

803
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:21,296
the one that it exploited in the hands.

804
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:26,566
To dissolve the Iraqi army
and the services of intelligence...

805
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:28,969
the most important institutions of Iraq.

806
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:30,438
The second order the CPA...

807
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:33,499
the Iraqi army dissolved,
the Republican Guard{Custody}...

808
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:36,171
the Republican Special Guard{Custody}
and the secret police.

809
00:43:36,246 --> 00:43:38,214
From the day until the morning, Bremer desempleó...

810
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,479
and it angered to half a million
of armed men...

811
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:43,986
what he{she} would be equivalent to dismiss{see off}
to more than five millions...

812
00:43:44,054 --> 00:43:45,453
in the United States.

813
00:43:45,522 --> 00:43:48,753
Instead of helping to prepare{anticipate}
the rebellion, these men...

814
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:50,851
they created one.

815
00:43:51,528 --> 00:43:56,830
DECLARATIONS
OF ANCIENT{FORMER} IRAQI SOLDIERS.

816
00:43:58,168 --> 00:43:59,829
I do not believe that they should do that.

817
00:43:59,903 --> 00:44:04,363
Hundreds of thousands of families
they were depending on the army.

818
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:07,672
They had no income, had no providers.

819
00:44:07,745 --> 00:44:13,911
We are hungry, there is no bread,
meal, money, we want to work.

820
00:44:13,984 --> 00:44:18,683
Children, women, wives,
sisters, parents...

821
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:23,193
they stopped eating because
there was no sufficient money.

822
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:26,787
The official number of unemployment is 27 %.

823
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:30,197
I am sure that it is much more.

824
00:44:30,267 --> 00:44:32,792
He{She} would say that between 40 % and 50 %.

825
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:34,861
It is not of missing{surprising} that these people...

826
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:38,305
of that almost they had all
military training...

827
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:40,969
since the military service
it is obligatory in Iraq...

828
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,535
or they were active military men...

829
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:47,778
they were joining the rebellion...

830
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:49,910
with ends{purposes} of feeding his families...

831
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,648
and of gaining{earning} something of pride.

832
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:55,557
After the Iraqi army dissolves...

833
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:57,253
Bremer was undoing a measurement...

834
00:44:57,327 --> 00:45:01,263
supported so much by the army
of the USA like{as} for the ORHA.

835
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:02,992
Paul Hughes had a team{equipment}...

836
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:05,001
that was looking for the Iraqi army...

837
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,832
and he{she} was finding many soldiers...

838
00:45:06,904 --> 00:45:08,769
and he{she} had already found many people...

839
00:45:08,839 --> 00:45:10,773
because we wanted reinstaurarlo.

840
00:45:10,841 --> 00:45:13,401
On having enlisted,
the soldiers had to sign...

841
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:15,672
or to refill a questionnaire...

842
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:18,909
on whom were they,
in what unit{unity} were they, what they were doing...

843
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:20,040
what skills did they have...

844
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,312
what did military man equip did they have in house...

845
00:45:22,386 --> 00:45:26,152
a lot of information...

846
00:45:26,223 --> 00:45:28,487
that us would have been useful to us.

847
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:30,151
I was assembling all that.

848
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,218
But the team{equipment} of advisers of Defense...

849
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,628
that it had to treat
with the Iraqi soldiers...

850
00:45:34,698 --> 00:45:36,325
in charge of Walter Slocombe...

851
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,131
it had remained in Washington
and he{she} had not visited Iraq.

852
00:45:40,204 --> 00:45:42,069
I said: " I do not see why we have to go.

853
00:45:42,139 --> 00:45:44,630
" I can prepare oneself better in Washington ".

854
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,302
I asked them repeatedly...

855
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:49,971
when he{she} was speaking with them from Baghdad...

856
00:45:50,047 --> 00:45:51,674
that had to come...

857
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,547
because there were the people waiting for them...

858
00:45:54,618 --> 00:45:56,984
and, in particular, to a man...

859
00:45:57,054 --> 00:46:01,013
so that it was taking decisions
and it was starting it.

860
00:46:01,091 --> 00:46:04,390
In his absence, they left to me the task...

861
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,861
of treating with the Iraqi army...

862
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:08,989
only to support the contact.

863
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:13,833
The Iraqi army was planted there...

864
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,394
waiting for an approach...

865
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:18,032
they were waiting what they believed that it would happen{pass}...

866
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,235
that someone was coming...

867
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:25,646
and he{she} was saying to them: " East is the plan,
and you are essential.

868
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:27,843
" We need them ".

869
00:46:27,918 --> 00:46:29,351
Nobody did it ever.

870
00:46:29,419 --> 00:46:30,545
On having finished the war...

871
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,714
on having finished the principal attacks...

872
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:36,317
units were already not staying
that will work...

873
00:46:36,393 --> 00:46:37,985
they all had gone away to house.

874
00:46:38,061 --> 00:46:39,358
The generals were returning...

875
00:46:39,429 --> 00:46:41,863
with finished divisions saying:
" These are mine ".

876
00:46:41,932 --> 00:46:43,627
One of the Iraqi officials...

877
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:47,568
at the end of the second one or the third meeting{convocation}...

878
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:53,304
when the chaos was reigning in Baghdad, he{she} said...

879
00:46:53,377 --> 00:46:56,471
" Colonel Paul,
I have 10.000 military police officers...

880
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:59,573
" at your disposal
in one week if you need them ".

881
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:02,619
I transmitted it to the people of Bernie Kerik...

882
00:47:02,686 --> 00:47:04,210
but they did not do anything.

883
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:10,090
In his place, Bremer ordered{arranged}
the dissolution of the army.

884
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:14,060
Five days after this order...

885
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:16,065
we were dismissing{seeing off} Jay Garner...

886
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:19,967
because it was going to leave Iraq
forever on the following day.

887
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:23,666
We were going in two vehicles in the highway...

888
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:26,436
going out of the Green space...

889
00:47:26,510 --> 00:47:30,105
when the emboscaron
and they killed two soldiers.

890
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:33,877
In my opinion, that one was
the beginning of the rebellion.

891
00:47:35,919 --> 00:47:40,652
We go, go, go!
We go, go, go!

892
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:43,625
My companions and I
we were sitting down in the balcony...

893
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:45,992
or in the roof
of the Palace of the Republic at night...

894
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:49,396
and we saw the trackers
for the whole Baghdad.

895
00:47:49,466 --> 00:47:52,594
We saw the flares
of different colors to rise...

896
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:54,830
indicating adónde they were going...

897
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:57,806
the convoys of the USA.
of certain compositions...

898
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:59,934
and how were the insurgents following{continued} them.

899
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:03,241
Iraq was possessing 10 big deposits of weapon

900
00:48:03,313 --> 00:48:06,248
and many more stores
of ammunition without watching.

901
00:48:06,316 --> 00:48:10,082
There were no sufficient soldiers
of the USA to watch them.

902
00:48:10,153 --> 00:48:12,644
They knew where the ammunition was...

903
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:17,057
they knew how to come
to the weapon and how to use them...

904
00:48:17,127 --> 00:48:20,688
and: you try to say to them
what do they go away because they do not exist?

905
00:48:20,764 --> 00:48:22,823
He{She} would not recommend the common sense to you.

906
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,164
There were enormous stores of ammunition...

907
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,693
without watching for weeks...

908
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:32,139
or even some months later
of finishing the principal combats.

909
00:48:32,209 --> 00:48:34,143
You see how the insurgents...

910
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:37,203
they extract missiles, mortars and bombs...

911
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,943
of these stored consignments
for the Iraqis...

912
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,780
and hidden in some place.

913
00:48:41,852 --> 00:48:45,015
Then you him{her; you} say to the Britons
or to those of the USA, who is...

914
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,181
with your small receiver GPS...

915
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:48,952
" Boys...

916
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:52,189
" we have found 18.000 millions
of tons of bombs...

917
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:54,890
" and there is a group of Iraqis with AK-47 s...

918
00:48:54,965 --> 00:48:56,330
" taking them.

919
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:59,665
" I do not believe that it is the best idea.
They are here ".

920
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:00,930
And they were saying to you...

921
00:49:01,004 --> 00:49:03,438
" There are no sufficient people to cover it ".

922
00:49:03,507 --> 00:49:06,635
One could not believe it,
it was not the correct response.

923
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,144
See and deal for your own safety...

924
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:10,839
for that of the citizens, for all...

925
00:49:10,914 --> 00:49:12,609
it is a bad idea.

926
00:49:25,262 --> 00:49:29,756
Someone him{her; you} warned
that to dissolve the army like that...

927
00:49:29,833 --> 00:49:36,102
it would impel, and in fact it impelled,
the massive growth of the rebellion?

928
00:49:36,173 --> 00:49:38,004
Certainly not in these terms.

929
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:40,043
Did nobody say it to himself?

930
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:41,475
Not. I do not believe that it is true...

931
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,479
but nobody said it, nobody said...

932
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:44,639
Does not he{she} believe that it is true?

933
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:46,114
Not, I do not believe that it is true.

934
00:49:46,183 --> 00:49:48,276
Generals' quantity of high status...

935
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:51,719
they came to the headquarters
of the UNO in the Hotel Channel...

936
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:54,484
and they were very clear
on the consequences...

937
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:56,890
of expressing{emitting} this order...

938
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,427
and of alienating...

939
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:01,487
to this powerful segment of the society...

940
00:50:01,565 --> 00:50:03,123
that would finish in rebellion.

941
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,499
A Lebanese diplomat
called Hassan Salami...

942
00:50:06,570 --> 00:50:09,630
he{she} said to his companion when
the generals went away...

943
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:11,298
after one of the meetings{convocations}...

944
00:50:11,375 --> 00:50:14,776
" I see bullets in his eyes.

945
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,073
" I see bullets in his eyes ".

946
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:20,238
Even more surprising
that the decision to dissolve the army...

947
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,615
it was the form in which this decision was taken...

948
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,415
Secretly, in one week...

949
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:28,185
for a group of men in Washington
that had never gone to Iraq.

950
00:50:28,258 --> 00:50:31,022
They did not consult it
with the commanders in Iraq...

951
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:33,028
not with the chiefs
of staff sets...

952
00:50:33,096 --> 00:50:34,927
not with the ORHA,
the department of the state{condition}...

953
00:50:34,998 --> 00:50:37,865
not with the CIA
not even the Council of National Safety...

954
00:50:37,934 --> 00:50:42,928
not even, as it seems,
with the president of the USA.

955
00:50:43,006 --> 00:50:45,804
We interviewed again
to Walter Slocombe and to Paul Hughes...

956
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,707
to reconstruct the events{cases}...

957
00:50:47,778 --> 00:50:49,803
that led to the dissolution of the army.

958
00:50:49,880 --> 00:50:53,782
They were called to yes same
Military Independent meeting{convocation}.

959
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:58,310
This meeting{convocation} was already counting
with 100.000 persons on May 9...

960
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,582
Did they already have 100.000?

961
00:50:59,656 --> 00:51:01,624
Yes, it was a national effort.

962
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:04,387
He{She} wanted all the copies...

963
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:07,328
all the discs, and they gave them to me...

964
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:10,059
and I took them to him to the ORHA.

965
00:51:10,133 --> 00:51:13,261
I said to them: " Here they have ",
and I said to Walt and to his team{equipment}...

966
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:16,169
" I have all this waiting for you ".

967
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:22,906
Hughes was thinking about being in contact
with Iraqi officials...

968
00:51:22,979 --> 00:51:25,846
that would have been ready
to re-constitute the units.

969
00:51:25,916 --> 00:51:29,511
It had already obtained 137.000
declarations{statements} of conscription.

970
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:34,785
Not. It had not done it. It is possible that it had...

971
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:38,191
Nobody might have obtained
declarations{statements} of 130.000 not at all...

972
00:51:38,261 --> 00:51:41,389
for nothing, in the chaos
that was reigning in this moment.

973
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:43,399
They had a system of courier service...

974
00:51:43,467 --> 00:51:47,995
that was covering the area
metropolitan of Baghdad...

975
00:51:48,071 --> 00:51:51,734
of Mosul, of Basora and of Kirkuk.

976
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:54,606
I do not understand...

977
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:59,878
Considering the difficulty
to do any thing...

978
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:02,646
in the ambience
of the operations and the organization...

979
00:52:02,719 --> 00:52:04,653
nobody had 137.000.

980
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:06,484
Walt was not there.

981
00:52:06,556 --> 00:52:09,548
He{She} never met with them,
it did not have it nor designs.

982
00:52:09,626 --> 00:52:12,720
Did he{she} say to Slocombe what happened?

983
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,856
Yes, it was known it. He{it} and his team{equipment}.

984
00:52:15,932 --> 00:52:17,456
You had already done him...

985
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:20,196
a recommendation
to ambassador Bremer...

986
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:24,172
and éI had done
a try of recommendation...

987
00:52:24,241 --> 00:52:26,232
to secretary Rumsfeld...

988
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:29,176
on the dissolution of the army...

989
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:32,010
On the emission of the order
in the end it expressed{emitted}, yes.

990
00:52:32,082 --> 00:52:34,949
Yes, on May 9.

991
00:52:35,018 --> 00:52:36,383
- Yes.
- Very well.

992
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:39,684
May 9 was the last time
that I had a conversation...

993
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:41,883
with Walt Slocombe.

994
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,426
We speak by phone
before I was going away.

995
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:45,586
One day he{she} said to him...

996
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,153
" We are thinking
in the army dissolves...

997
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:50,392
" and to stop{detain} your efforts to reform it "?

998
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,833
One of the things that I did...

999
00:52:52,903 --> 00:52:55,428
Did he{she} say it to himself ever?

1000
00:52:55,505 --> 00:52:56,972
With these words, not.

1001
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,134
The conversation was: " I go for there.

1002
00:53:00,210 --> 00:53:02,440
" It worries me where I am going to live.

1003
00:53:02,512 --> 00:53:05,037
" Will I have vehicles at my disposal?

1004
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:07,811
" My own cooks? ". Bla, bla, bla.

1005
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:11,081
It was not a question of the Iraqi army.

1006
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:13,645
I was informing him on the matter...

1007
00:53:13,723 --> 00:53:15,850
He{She} did not say that there was already...

1008
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,053
come to the conclusion...

1009
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,858
and it had recommended
to Bremer the dissolution of the army?

1010
00:53:20,931 --> 00:53:23,058
Insurance that not, because in this case...

1011
00:53:23,133 --> 00:53:26,466
he{she} would have been going to see Jay immediately.

1012
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:29,061
This idea occurred to them...

1013
00:53:29,139 --> 00:53:31,164
and it was recommended to Rumsfeld...

1014
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:34,972
without speaking with anybody in Iraq
that was responsible...

1015
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:36,444
of these matters?

1016
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:40,540
It was hanging,
and, precisely, due to...

1017
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:43,586
that only had been thought
for some days...

1018
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:46,315
because Bremer was going away to Iraq
and he{she} said to Rumsfeld...

1019
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:50,155
" Before doing a recommendation,
I will speak with the people there ".

1020
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:53,121
Bremer came to Baghdad on May 12.

1021
00:53:53,196 --> 00:53:57,496
His consultations with the people
in ground they were brief or nonexistent.

1022
00:53:57,567 --> 00:53:59,762
Did he{she} surprise it?
Had they commented on it to themselves?

1023
00:53:59,836 --> 00:54:01,394
Not, nobody said anything to me...

1024
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:02,904
it was a big surprise.

1025
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:04,668
- Seriously?
- Aha.

1026
00:54:04,741 --> 00:54:07,733
It never called Garner and said:
" We want to do this...

1027
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:09,904
" does it look like to you a good idea? ".

1028
00:54:11,181 --> 00:54:13,149
I believe that not.

1029
00:54:15,018 --> 00:54:16,781
Does not he{she} believe that this was an error?

1030
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:18,013
Not.

1031
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,087
Was CuáI his reaction? What did he{she} think?

1032
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:22,624
It looked like to me awful idea.

1033
00:54:22,692 --> 00:54:25,354
I believed that it was necessary to do the opposite.

1034
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:30,028
The commanders of the army also
they were opposed to the decision of Bremer.

1035
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:34,036
John Abizaid and Dave McKiernan
they were saying to me constantly...

1036
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:36,836
" Do we worry?
" Let's reform the army ".

1037
00:54:36,906 --> 00:54:38,134
Now there are many{many people}...

1038
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:41,644
ancient{former} Iraqi soldiers
without employment{job}.

1039
00:54:41,711 --> 00:54:44,874
Not only it is worrying
for the safety...

1040
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,813
but for the economy.

1041
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:49,249
They already do not have a salary.

1042
00:54:49,319 --> 00:54:51,082
Then he{she} promises to be...

1043
00:54:51,154 --> 00:54:55,887
that the Iraqi army has been dissolved,
I remained without words.

1044
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:59,554
In this epoch,
Walt Slocombe and his team{equipment}...

1045
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:02,359
they still{yet} had not come to Iraq.

1046
00:55:02,432 --> 00:55:04,627
Colonel Hughes was the manager...

1047
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:06,259
of treating with the Iraqi army...

1048
00:55:06,336 --> 00:55:08,702
because nobody
of his group of advice...

1049
00:55:08,772 --> 00:55:12,071
it had gone still to Iraq, included you.

1050
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,838
He{She} did not think that it should
to have spoken with éI on this matter?

1051
00:55:14,911 --> 00:55:17,709
- I spoke with éI very much.
- It is curious.

1052
00:55:17,781 --> 00:55:20,716
He{She} says that the order to dissolve the army...

1053
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:22,615
it was an entire surprise for éI...

1054
00:55:22,686 --> 00:55:26,520
and that found out
for television in the airport.

1055
00:55:28,024 --> 00:55:29,457
That is... If that is like that...

1056
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:33,394
I surprise it, but it is impossible.

1057
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:35,158
I spoke with him{it}...
Or, I spoke...

1058
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,823
I...

1059
00:55:36,900 --> 00:55:41,394
We work together every day
while I was there.

1060
00:55:41,471 --> 00:55:44,338
- May 16 came.
- On May 16?

1061
00:55:44,407 --> 00:55:48,104
For a brief visit
of four days for the country.

1062
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,178
Ah.

1063
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:53,980
Then one went and did not return
until middle of June.

1064
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,041
- Seriously?
- This way it is.

1065
00:55:57,120 --> 00:55:59,054
Did not he{she} comment on it to himself?

1066
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:05,152
Jay Garner and Paul Hughes were not
the only ones surprised by the order.

1067
00:56:05,228 --> 00:56:07,822
The idea of dissolving the whole army...

1068
00:56:07,897 --> 00:56:09,888
it took me as a surprise.

1069
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:11,695
I see already.

1070
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:13,292
Was CuáI his reaction?

1071
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:15,497
I thought that we had created a problem.

1072
00:56:15,572 --> 00:56:18,598
There were many unemployed soldiers.

1073
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:20,336
The president had another idea...

1074
00:56:20,410 --> 00:56:24,107
that was to support assets
the battalions and low{lower} status.

1075
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:25,477
- Earlier, yes.
- Yes.

1076
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:29,006
Concerning a few days.

1077
00:56:29,085 --> 00:56:31,315
To the majority we surprised it a little...

1078
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,686
or completely the dissolution of the army.

1079
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:37,090
Secretary Powell knew it just as I.

1080
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:38,388
How?

1081
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:39,894
We find out the day...

1082
00:56:39,963 --> 00:56:41,863
that Jerry announced the dissolution.

1083
00:56:41,931 --> 00:56:44,764
- And Condoleezza Rice?
- That she speaks for yes same.

1084
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:49,771
Condoleezza Rice refused
to be interviewed for this documentary.

1085
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,739
How much did the president know...

1086
00:56:51,808 --> 00:56:53,901
on these decisions in advance?

1087
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:57,743
I said already before sé if Rumsfeld
he{she} had informed him or not.

1088
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:58,814
It does not even design.

1089
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,873
I was only two hours in the office...

1090
00:57:00,950 --> 00:57:03,885
a young military police officer came and said...

1091
00:57:03,953 --> 00:57:07,150
" Colonel Hughes,
there are some Iraqi officials...

1092
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:09,020
" that want to speak with you ".

1093
00:57:09,092 --> 00:57:11,253
I was saying to myself: " Go for God.

1094
00:57:11,327 --> 00:57:13,227
" What am I going to say to them? ".

1095
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:15,093
In the end I decided to go down...

1096
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:19,067
and to meet with them
in the Palace of the Republic.

1097
00:57:19,135 --> 00:57:23,731
Colonel Mirjan said: " What has happened{passed}? ".

1098
00:57:23,807 --> 00:57:25,900
I answered him: " I do not know what has happened{passed}.

1099
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:29,035
" I do not have it nor designs
from how has this arisen ".

1100
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:34,448
He{She} said to me: " All these soldiers
they already have no resources{resorts}.

1101
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:36,007
" Money does not come already to them.

1102
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:38,053
" What are they going to do now? ".

1103
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:53,226
Moan, carajo.

1104
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:57,262
In July, 2003, the insurgents begin
to put explosives for the whole Iraq.

1105
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:00,434
There is a big increase
in the falls{casualties} of the soldiers of the USA.

1106
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:02,034
How many times have I said it to you?

1107
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,703
- Shit!
- Carajo!

1108
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:05,042
Moan, my ear!

1109
00:58:05,114 --> 00:58:06,741
It is necessary to leave from here.

1110
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:10,115
Some of them believe...

1111
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:12,552
that the possibility exists
of that they attack us.

1112
00:58:12,622 --> 00:58:14,419
My response is that they dare.

1113
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,322
I was going in the bucket.

1114
00:58:17,293 --> 00:58:21,161
The bucket is a vehicle
that is not armored.

1115
00:58:21,231 --> 00:58:25,258
If something happens{passes}, it is going to reach you.

1116
00:58:25,335 --> 00:58:27,599
Nobody wants to go there.

1117
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:32,238
In 2003, only 1 of every 8 vehicles in Iraq
it had the appropriate shielding{armor}.

1118
00:58:32,308 --> 00:58:36,972
The explosion gave to me almost directly.

1119
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:39,708
Then, I went out...

1120
00:58:39,782 --> 00:58:42,546
I started hearing shootings...

1121
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:47,420
that were approaching ... bang, bang.
We start shooting.

1122
00:58:47,490 --> 00:58:50,584
We have a small problem
with some resistance...

1123
00:58:50,660 --> 00:58:53,424
traces of the ancient{former} diet{regime}...

1124
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:56,021
that use military professional tactics...

1125
00:58:56,099 --> 00:59:00,229
to attack and to kill our soldiers,
as on the same morning.

1126
00:59:00,303 --> 00:59:01,395
- Not...
- He{She} does not believe...

1127
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:03,063
what is a coordinated campaign?

1128
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,936
- Not, not...
- That is guerrillas...

1129
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:07,841
that we have brought in{approached}
in the phase of guerrilla war?

1130
00:59:07,911 --> 00:59:09,902
Because of this explosion...

1131
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:15,110
I suffered an injury
cerebral traumatic sharp...

1132
00:59:15,184 --> 00:59:19,587
and I lost the perception
of the light in the right eye.

1133
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,757
I suffered damages in the left eye...

1134
00:59:23,826 --> 00:59:28,923
that they caused
a hole to blacken in the retina...

1135
00:59:28,998 --> 00:59:34,959
but we fight, fight
up to the high place to the fire.

1136
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:38,997
I was a gunner. My driver
it lost two legs...

1137
00:59:39,075 --> 00:59:41,407
and I went out flying of the car...

1138
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:47,313
and I suffered a break of femur,
almost I lose the right arm...

1139
00:59:47,383 --> 00:59:51,513
me colapsó a lung
and I had internal wounds in the head.

1140
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:55,922
Since then,
I have looked in the dictionary...

1141
00:59:55,992 --> 00:59:58,586
some things, of which
I do not remember very much...

1142
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:00,788
but one was a " guerrilla war "...

1143
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:03,423
the different one was a " rebellion ", another age...

1144
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,296
slightly conventional " war ". Pardon?

1145
01:00:05,368 --> 01:00:08,269
Impasse?

1146
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:12,138
Not, of that another person takes charge...

1147
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:13,835
I do not do these things.

1148
01:00:13,910 --> 01:00:16,936
I meet an expert
in counter-insurgency.

1149
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:21,040
It was in the palace where
the CPA has his headquarters...

1150
01:00:21,117 --> 01:00:23,176
and he{she} was speaking with a colonel of the army...

1151
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:25,447
that was sitting down nearby
of the office of Bremer.

1152
01:00:25,521 --> 01:00:29,787
The word " rebellion " and the colonel used...

1153
01:00:29,859 --> 01:00:34,159
it raised the hand and said:
" In Iraq there is no rebellion.

1154
01:00:34,230 --> 01:00:36,858
" There is a high level of popular violence ".

1155
01:00:37,767 --> 01:00:39,234
The safety problem...

1156
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:43,568
progressively it prevented us
to realize our work.

1157
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:50,102
He{She} would have wanted to establish commissions
of advice in the quarters.

1158
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:51,703
Three general managers...

1159
01:00:51,781 --> 01:00:56,241
they gave perhaps the presentation
more coherent on the structure...

1160
01:00:56,319 --> 01:01:00,585
and the organization
of a city of 1500 years...

1161
01:01:00,657 --> 01:01:02,090
that could happen{exist}.

1162
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:08,290
One of them got overturned in a plan...

1163
01:01:08,364 --> 01:01:10,264
for the groups of advice.

1164
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:17,034
It had designed a local democratization
beginning from the people{village}.

1165
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:19,734
It was a beautiful plan.

1166
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:20,935
And: what happened?

1167
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,136
It was murdered.

1168
01:01:22,211 --> 01:01:24,076
The country descontrolaba more and more...

1169
01:01:24,147 --> 01:01:26,843
all the time,
and I believe that, somehow...

1170
01:01:26,916 --> 01:01:28,713
Bremer and his assistants did not know...

1171
01:01:28,785 --> 01:01:32,744
the bad thing on that the things were putting themselves
beyond the walls of containment.

1172
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:37,751
THE PROVISIONAL AUTHORITY
OF THE COALITION

1173
01:01:42,398 --> 01:01:45,231
With his head office in the ancient{former} one
Palace of the Republic of Saddam...

1174
01:01:45,301 --> 01:01:48,600
the enclosure of the CPA,
called the Green space...

1175
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:51,196
it was protected by 12 km from walls.

1176
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:56,905
There were enormous lines of Iraqis,
engineers, officials...

1177
01:01:56,979 --> 01:01:58,105
JOURNALIST
IN BAGHDAD FROM APRIL, 2003

1178
01:01:58,181 --> 01:02:00,149
They wanted to help, to translate...

1179
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:03,242
In line on the verge of the palace...

1180
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:06,049
they were making them wait and nobody was receiving them.

1181
01:02:06,122 --> 01:02:08,716
They were saying to them that they should and were doing not returning.

1182
01:02:08,791 --> 01:02:10,782
The people were trying his{her} one, two...

1183
01:02:10,860 --> 01:02:12,293
three times and it is already.

1184
01:02:12,361 --> 01:02:13,828
He{She} hated the Green space.

1185
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:16,763
It was going out whenever it could
to meet with the Iraqis...

1186
01:02:16,833 --> 01:02:18,994
to go to his hearths and to listen to his complaints...

1187
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:20,262
and his opinions.

1188
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:22,270
Then he{she} was saying to Dan Senor...

1189
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:25,466
" They have a problem,
they do not speak with the Iraqis ".

1190
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:29,974
Dan Senor, the spokesman
of press of Bremer, he{she} does not speak Arabic.

1191
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:33,846
Almost no high control
about the CPA he{she} was speaking Arabic.

1192
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:36,612
Five or six were counted{told}...

1193
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:40,713
between the 40, 50
ó 70 more important officials.

1194
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:44,226
We had regional experts
that had served in Iraq.

1195
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:47,023
But since it has researched, many{many people}...

1196
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,291
they did not take part in the initial phase...

1197
01:02:49,365 --> 01:02:52,960
after the invasion of Iraq
and the initial occupation...

1198
01:02:53,035 --> 01:02:55,003
so this skill got lost.

1199
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:58,336
How did it finish his stage there.

1200
01:02:58,407 --> 01:03:00,568
- Mm...
- I understand...

1201
01:03:00,643 --> 01:03:01,667
that is a difficult topic.

1202
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:03,507
Say to us what he{she} should want.

1203
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:05,604
Mm...

1204
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:09,879
He{She} would say that it ended
long before what he{she} was thinking...

1205
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:13,888
and very much earlier
of what I had wanted.

1206
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,789
I had liked being...

1207
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:18,451
and to try to give everything...

1208
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:20,758
Considering the frustrations and the limitations...

1209
01:03:20,830 --> 01:03:24,266
much was deserving
the sorrow{sentence} to be in this place...

1210
01:03:24,333 --> 01:03:26,494
and to try to do what we wanted to do.

1211
01:03:26,569 --> 01:03:28,002
Why did they dismiss{see off} her?

1212
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:31,335
I know why. They said it to me.

1213
01:03:31,407 --> 01:03:32,772
Why?

1214
01:03:32,842 --> 01:03:34,139
It was difficult to treat...

1215
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,407
and it was giving opinions...

1216
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:40,415
that were going against the current
of the epoch in Baghdad.

1217
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:45,443
Since Bremer appeared,
the new people were coming to us.

1218
01:03:45,521 --> 01:03:49,082
Newly adjusted as the school: do you know?

1219
01:03:49,158 --> 01:03:51,319
They had the secondary one...

1220
01:03:51,394 --> 01:03:54,158
from the autumn ... the previous spring.

1221
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:57,028
Papi did a contribution to the campaign...

1222
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:59,363
and the child has the opportunity to come...

1223
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:03,098
and to live through a full trip
of diversion and adventure.

1224
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:06,141
Dad's children, this way I was calling them...

1225
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:09,906
and they were sitting down opposite to the door of Bremer
and they were not doing anything.

1226
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:11,139
In my stay...

1227
01:04:11,214 --> 01:04:12,340
MANAGER OF ONG AND PROFESSOR

1228
01:04:12,415 --> 01:04:13,643
... in the Green space...

1229
01:04:13,716 --> 01:04:15,809
I met one of my students...

1230
01:04:15,885 --> 01:04:17,352
newly graduated.

1231
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,389
I asked him what it was doing there and he{she} said to me...

1232
01:04:20,456 --> 01:04:21,582
radiant of happiness...

1233
01:04:21,657 --> 01:04:23,625
" They have asked me to do...

1234
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:26,253
" the plan of traffic for the city ".

1235
01:04:26,329 --> 01:04:29,696
I asked him if it was known something
of municipal planning...

1236
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:31,460
and he{she} said to me that not.

1237
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,401
Newly gone out of the school...

1238
01:04:35,471 --> 01:04:38,565
and supervised by something quite complicated...

1239
01:04:38,641 --> 01:04:41,439
to say the least, and
seeing the traffic of Baghdad...

1240
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:42,841
the need is obvious.

1241
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:46,109
Almost all the officials
they had contracts of three months.

1242
01:04:46,182 --> 01:04:47,706
As soon as they were creating...

1243
01:04:47,783 --> 01:04:50,013
the suitable relations
with the Iraqis...

1244
01:04:50,086 --> 01:04:54,546
in 90 days, 100 days, 120 days,
they were going away to house...

1245
01:04:54,624 --> 01:04:58,924
and there is nothing worse than that
to direct an organization.

1246
01:04:58,995 --> 01:05:00,360
There was a preference...

1247
01:05:00,429 --> 01:05:01,794
SPECIALIST IN BUDGET
CATEDRÁTICA

1248
01:05:01,864 --> 01:05:04,628
... much egg white of the Pentagon...

1249
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:08,192
for that the companies
of the USA they were doing the work.

1250
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:12,708
There were numerous cases
in that Iraqi contractors...

1251
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:15,073
they proposed to do the same work...

1252
01:05:15,144 --> 01:05:17,305
for much less money...

1253
01:05:17,380 --> 01:05:19,610
that the contractors of the USA.

1254
01:05:19,682 --> 01:05:21,980
Ann and I had a different approach...

1255
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:24,349
to that of many units of the coalition...

1256
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:27,355
because we work
in team{equipment} with the Iraqis.

1257
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:30,221
If we were going to meetings{convocations},
it was with Americans...

1258
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:31,385
THE FIRST LIEUTENANT, MARINATES

1259
01:05:31,460 --> 01:05:35,328
... and Iraqis, and the Iraqis
they had the same voice as we.

1260
01:05:35,398 --> 01:05:37,958
We were constructing our fortresses...

1261
01:05:38,034 --> 01:05:39,501
along with{near to} those of the army...

1262
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:42,196
that was using a big contractor
of the USA, Parsons.

1263
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,762
We were designing and constructing
our fortresses...

1264
01:05:44,840 --> 01:05:47,138
in approximately five months.

1265
01:05:47,209 --> 01:05:48,938
On having gone away, the fortresses of Parsons...

1266
01:05:49,011 --> 01:05:51,206
begun
one year before we come...

1267
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:52,406
they were still not finished.

1268
01:05:52,748 --> 01:05:56,707
The fortresses of Seth Moulton
and Ann Gildroy they cost 200.000 dollars.

1269
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:59,084
Those of Parsons cost
1200 million dollars.

1270
01:05:59,155 --> 01:06:02,750
The officials of the army
often they were going out to the street...

1271
01:06:02,825 --> 01:06:06,283
to spend the small quantity
of funds that they had...

1272
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:10,526
for immediate action in,
let's say, to clean the streets...

1273
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:14,467
to realize temporary progress
in the drainage system...

1274
01:06:14,537 --> 01:06:15,697
On having been finished...

1275
01:06:15,771 --> 01:06:18,205
this small quantity of money in that...

1276
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:19,866
everything was relapsing into the CPA.

1277
01:06:19,942 --> 01:06:21,910
" We need this and this...

1278
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:24,947
" for these projects, and it will cost so much ".

1279
01:06:25,014 --> 01:06:29,110
It was disappearing, simply it was disappearing.

1280
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:30,311
" And my request? "

1281
01:06:30,386 --> 01:06:31,785
" What request? "

1282
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:34,880
That was not stopping recuring.

1283
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:40,857
18.000 million dollars happened{existed}
for the reconstruction in October, 2003.

1284
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:44,991
18.000 million dollars
that the Congress promised...

1285
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:48,764
they were misinterpreted and were wasted...

1286
01:06:48,838 --> 01:06:50,066
if it went so far as to spend.

1287
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:51,970
We will produce sufficient electricity...

1288
01:06:52,041 --> 01:06:53,372
so that in the whole Iraq there is...

1289
01:06:53,442 --> 01:06:56,411
electrical{electric} service 24 hours of the day...

1290
01:06:56,479 --> 01:07:00,313
essential for his hopes of future.

1291
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:04,945
There was fraud, corruption and squandering.

1292
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:09,590
One year later, only 1.000 million
of dollars they had been invested in Iraq.

1293
01:07:09,658 --> 01:07:12,422
The normal people obtain electricity...

1294
01:07:12,495 --> 01:07:15,055
only two or three hours a day.

1295
01:07:15,131 --> 01:07:19,227
The water comes occasionally,
every two or three days.

1296
01:07:19,301 --> 01:07:22,270
We spend{pass} the winter trembling,
wrapped in blankets...

1297
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:27,173
because we have no fuel
for the heaters.

1298
01:07:27,243 --> 01:07:30,076
This way it is our life.

1299
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:46,986
In May, 2003...

1300
01:07:47,063 --> 01:07:49,156
the United Nations
he{she} sent his best expert...

1301
01:07:49,231 --> 01:07:52,598
in reconstruction of postwar period
to help in the occupation of the USA.

1302
01:07:52,668 --> 01:07:55,569
He was a Brazilian diplomat
so-called Sergio Vieira de Mello.

1303
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:56,638
SPECIAL REPRESENTATIVE OF THE UNO

1304
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:59,505
Although they were not leaving that the UNO
it was making nothing important...

1305
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,543
Kofi Annan said: " I will send the best.

1306
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:05,341
" If someone can leave well the UNO...

1307
01:08:05,414 --> 01:08:07,382
" this is Sergio Vieira de Mello ".

1308
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,475
I belonged to his team{equipment}, I was his...

1309
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:12,850
SPECIAL ADVISER OF THE UNO
... political principal adviser...

1310
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,117
and we were together to Baghdad.

1311
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:18,024
All our political team{equipment}
he{she} was speaking Arabic...

1312
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:22,155
and it had experience working
in the region and others.

1313
01:08:22,231 --> 01:08:24,256
One of the best things
that Sergio did...

1314
01:08:24,333 --> 01:08:25,800
with hindsight the fact was that...

1315
01:08:25,868 --> 01:08:29,099
on having seen that the USA had shut itself up...

1316
01:08:29,171 --> 01:08:34,131
in the Green space
and it was not going out to the streets of Iraq...

1317
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:36,576
Sergio created a structure in Iraq...

1318
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:38,340
that was the opposite to the Green space.

1319
01:08:38,414 --> 01:08:40,006
Call it the Green Antiarea.

1320
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:43,779
I hear the political leaders...

1321
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:46,515
to say that we will meet every day.

1322
01:08:46,589 --> 01:08:49,183
We discuss often with the soldiers...

1323
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:53,592
that were coming to the UNO to speak
with Sergio Vieira de Mello...

1324
01:08:53,662 --> 01:08:56,096
and they were asking him to come up...

1325
01:08:56,165 --> 01:08:59,032
in the dispute{argument} that the CPA was supporting with.

1326
01:08:59,101 --> 01:09:01,296
You saw long lines
on the outside of the Green space...

1327
01:09:01,370 --> 01:09:03,702
but nobody heard his complaints.

1328
01:09:03,772 --> 01:09:07,469
On the contrary, the enclosure of the UNO
it was completely an open sea.

1329
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:10,512
If you wanted to complain, the UNO
it was more than arranged...

1330
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:13,412
to listen to you,
and Sergio saw as{like} his mission...

1331
01:09:13,482 --> 01:09:15,780
to spend{pass} these complaints to Bremer,
to the highest thing...

1332
01:09:15,851 --> 01:09:17,876
with the hope that they were doing something...

1333
01:09:17,953 --> 01:09:20,251
before the rebellion was becoming strong.

1334
01:09:20,322 --> 01:09:22,847
I meet with éI often...

1335
01:09:22,925 --> 01:09:26,122
and I share my advices{councils} and my experience.

1336
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:29,164
As soon as Bremer obtained
what he{she} wanted of Sergio...

1337
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:30,960
of the UNO...

1338
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,934
it already did not have any more time
for the United Nations.

1339
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:35,493
Through what Sergio lived...

1340
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:38,404
there were two months
of being used, literally...

1341
01:09:38,474 --> 01:09:41,739
to come to certain segments
of the Iraqi society...

1342
01:09:41,810 --> 01:09:43,141
and, in his last month...

1343
01:09:43,212 --> 01:09:45,806
he{she} had to support
they neither that nor him were answering the phone.

1344
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:48,076
Matters as{like} political of detention...

1345
01:09:48,150 --> 01:09:50,948
to hood the prisoners,
there were topics that Sergio...

1346
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:54,217
it was treating repeatedly with Bremer
and with general Sánchez...

1347
01:09:54,290 --> 01:09:57,259
but Bremer was not interested in.

1348
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:10,598
Three or four crucial months
after the fall of Baghdad...

1349
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:14,439
two principal things
that the soldiers of the USA were doing, were...

1350
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:18,674
to look for weapon of massive destruction
and to Saddam Hussein.

1351
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:21,045
The process of these searches...

1352
01:10:21,116 --> 01:10:23,141
throwing{shooting} doors below in the night...

1353
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,813
intimidating the people,
taking them to Abu Ghraib...

1354
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:29,984
doing detentions in mass,
it had a bitter effect.

1355
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:37,828
We go! Forward!

1356
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:40,425
We go! We go!

1357
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:56,617
If you were Iraqi in military age...

1358
01:10:56,685 --> 01:10:59,711
in an area of operations
of the army of EE.UU...

1359
01:10:59,788 --> 01:11:01,619
it was very probable that they were arresting you...

1360
01:11:01,690 --> 01:11:05,421
or they will intern{hospitalize; send inland} you as{like} possible insurgent.

1361
01:11:05,494 --> 01:11:08,861
Only for being a man
in military age in the area of operations.

1362
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:10,831
In many occasions, on having removed...

1363
01:11:10,899 --> 01:11:13,527
to the Iraqi in military age of his family...

1364
01:11:13,602 --> 01:11:14,830
you take to the head of the family.

1365
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,736
I have not anybody left,
I swear it for the life of Mahoma

1366
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:20,570
it has not made bad at all.

1367
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:23,203
Moan, my son, Amer!

1368
01:11:25,281 --> 01:11:28,148
Not only you anger to éI,
but to all his family...

1369
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:31,744
because it is possible that not only it supports
to his most nearby family.

1370
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:38,352
When they heard the helicopters of EE.UU...

1371
01:11:38,427 --> 01:11:40,861
or the tanks of the USA for the streets...

1372
01:11:40,929 --> 01:11:43,295
they were getting up immediately...

1373
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:45,424
although it was going to two o'clock in the morning...

1374
01:11:45,501 --> 01:11:48,470
and they were prepared for the detention.

1375
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:52,803
Because for them,
even now, it is the normal thing.

1376
01:11:54,176 --> 01:11:58,237
There were attacks on
the proper American soldiers...

1377
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,441
and they were answering to these attacks...

1378
01:12:00,516 --> 01:12:03,007
going out to look for the insurgents...

1379
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:04,780
and on having tried to do that...

1380
01:12:04,853 --> 01:12:09,051
sometimes, they were arresting
to the wrong persons.

1381
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:12,252
Even, sometimes, they were killing
to the wrong person.

1382
01:12:12,328 --> 01:12:14,922
After arresting someone,
they were tending to disappear...

1383
01:12:14,997 --> 01:12:18,160
in the prison military system of EE.UU...

1384
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:20,030
during a lot of time without track.

1385
01:12:20,102 --> 01:12:21,763
His families did not know anything.

1386
01:12:22,404 --> 01:12:24,998
The army of the USA does not reveal...

1387
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:28,373
the number of brave Iraqis
or arrested in Iraq from 2003.

1388
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:31,743
It is difficult to understand
what feels to the busy{occupied} being.

1389
01:12:31,814 --> 01:12:33,475
They aim at you from the vehicles.

1390
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:35,016
They make you stop{detain} the car.

1391
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:37,609
The Iraqis were not understanding
the instructions...

1392
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:39,517
that were giving to them in the positions of control.

1393
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:41,886
If they were approaching very rapidly, they were killing them.

1394
01:12:41,957 --> 01:12:44,221
Almost all the units
of the USA with that I was...

1395
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:46,921
they were straining very much
in doing the correct thing...

1396
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:48,622
and not to kill or to hurt nobody...

1397
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:51,825
that did not want
or they will need to kill or to hurt.

1398
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:54,994
But there is no doubt
of that the wars are chaotic...

1399
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:57,038
and, this one in Iraq...

1400
01:12:57,106 --> 01:12:59,267
at this level of rebellion...

1401
01:12:59,341 --> 01:13:00,501
it is even worse.

1402
01:13:00,576 --> 01:13:04,239
One after other one, they were taking
decisions in the short term...

1403
01:13:04,313 --> 01:13:06,804
that, at the end of 2003...

1404
01:13:06,882 --> 01:13:09,817
they proved in a country
with an increasing rebellion.

1405
01:13:11,086 --> 01:13:16,649
HEAD OFFICE OF THE UNO IN BAGHDAD
ON AUGUST 19, 2003

1406
01:13:24,566 --> 01:13:26,932
On August 19, 2003,
an enormous bomb destroyed

1407
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:29,937
the head office of the UNO in Baghdad
murdering 22 persons.

1408
01:13:30,005 --> 01:13:31,370
Between the dead persons,

1409
01:13:31,440 --> 01:13:35,206
the special envoy of the UNO in Iraq,
Sergio Vieira de Mello.

1410
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:55,694
A truck done in Russia...

1411
01:13:55,764 --> 01:13:59,564
he{she} parked opposite to the window
of Sergio Vieira de Mello...

1412
01:13:59,635 --> 01:14:03,036
and the enormous one detonated
quantity of explosives.

1413
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:07,235
The whole corner south-west
of the building{edifice} of the UNO it collapsed.

1414
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:09,277
Sergio was still alive under the debris...

1415
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:12,507
more than three hours
hoping that they should rescue it.

1416
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:15,448
We lost many companions this day...

1417
01:14:15,517 --> 01:14:18,850
and I believe that it was the sign
of that slightly drastic...

1418
01:14:18,921 --> 01:14:22,288
it had happened in the country and of that
the rebellion had turned...

1419
01:14:22,357 --> 01:14:23,984
in very lethal and organized...

1420
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:27,290
ready for a long struggle...

1421
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:29,455
against the forces of the coalition.

1422
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:35,993
In 2004, the relation between the army...

1423
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:38,972
and the Iraqi people{village}
it had become untenable.

1424
01:14:41,176 --> 01:14:42,939
Here it are where to these mierditas...

1425
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:45,275
they like throwing{shooting} stones to us.

1426
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:49,741
Curse!

1427
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:56,447
There you have it!
But we cannot use mortal force.

1428
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:58,015
We cannot use mortal force.

1429
01:14:58,093 --> 01:14:59,822
Lump it!

1430
01:14:59,895 --> 01:15:02,455
Lump it you, mierdita!

1431
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:07,332
There are seen civil many{many people} that are going to work...

1432
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:08,835
for the private contractors...

1433
01:15:08,904 --> 01:15:11,668
that take charge of big part
of the reconstruction...

1434
01:15:11,740 --> 01:15:13,537
because we do not have sufficient troops.

1435
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:18,507
There are more than 45.000 contractors
deprived of the army in Iraq,

1436
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:20,707
more than in no other war of the USA.

1437
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:23,618
PARLIAMENTARIAN IRAQUÍ
They have special custodies.

1438
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:26,779
I do not know who are...

1439
01:15:26,855 --> 01:15:29,722
they have permission to shoot
to the people, as well as this way.

1440
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:32,589
I have seen multitude of civil contractors...

1441
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:36,995
especially violent...

1442
01:15:37,065 --> 01:15:39,226
and with few vision on what they do.

1443
01:15:39,835 --> 01:15:43,737
What it continues{follows} is a home-loving video
of a private military contractor in Iraq.

1444
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:45,238
The music belongs to the original.

1445
01:16:14,836 --> 01:16:18,431
Saddam hurt us very much, it is true.

1446
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:20,600
It is something that does not forget.

1447
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:24,635
But what has come
it is worse than Saddam.

1448
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:27,546
When a problem like that is created,

1449
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:29,140
it is necessary to arrange it or to go away.

1450
01:16:29,217 --> 01:16:31,014
They should not leave it this way.

1451
01:16:31,086 --> 01:16:32,815
Arrange it or out.

1452
01:16:32,888 --> 01:16:35,982
In any moment,
when it has an opportunity...

1453
01:16:36,058 --> 01:16:37,787
I will face to the United States.

1454
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:39,850
With weapon?

1455
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:43,489
Of any form, with or without weapon.

1456
01:16:43,565 --> 01:16:45,294
Did it already face them?

1457
01:16:48,737 --> 01:16:51,365
Perhaps.

1458
01:16:51,673 --> 01:16:53,971
At the beginning of 2004, Faluya...

1459
01:16:54,042 --> 01:16:57,478
a city of 350.000 inhabitants
to the west of Baghdad...

1460
01:16:57,546 --> 01:17:00,982
it had turned into the center
of the rebellion suní.

1461
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:07,555
On March 31, 2004...

1462
01:17:07,623 --> 01:17:10,592
four military contractors
of the USA they were murdered...

1463
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:13,219
and his bodies were
dragged by the streets...

1464
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:14,887
for victorious multitudes.

1465
01:17:19,134 --> 01:17:21,125
At the beginning of 2004...

1466
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:23,103
the Council of National Intelligence...

1467
01:17:23,171 --> 01:17:24,866
a powerful committee of 12 persons...

1468
01:17:24,940 --> 01:17:28,103
placed at the head of the community
of intelligence of EE.UU...

1469
01:17:28,176 --> 01:17:31,111
it realized several evaluations
of the increasing rebellion...

1470
01:17:31,179 --> 01:17:32,976
to that they presented themselves{appeared} to the White House...

1471
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:35,380
and to tall officials of the government.

1472
01:17:35,450 --> 01:17:39,011
We register
the growth of the rebellion.

1473
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:42,147
It was growing and was not limiting itself
to foreign combatants...

1474
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:44,590
or to baazistas coldness.

1475
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,924
What we call a rebellion...

1476
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:49,327
it is a deep-rooted fact
of multiple facets.

1477
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:50,797
OFFICIAL OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE
FOR THE MIDDLE EAST

1478
01:17:50,866 --> 01:17:52,629
Not only some rebels baazistas...

1479
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:56,262
not only a few foreign extremists...

1480
01:17:56,338 --> 01:18:00,798
but rather it was reflecting
multiple motivations...

1481
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:02,036
and frustrations...

1482
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:03,543
between the proper Iraqis.

1483
01:18:03,612 --> 01:18:07,343
After the economic{economical} situation deteriorates...

1484
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:11,648
on having weakened
the personal safety of the people{village}...

1485
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:15,884
and after the resentment grows
against the occupation of the USA.

1486
01:18:15,957 --> 01:18:19,393
The CIA...

1487
01:18:19,461 --> 01:18:21,861
it raised...

1488
01:18:21,930 --> 01:18:24,728
several cases...

1489
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,236
in that the life
it could be the awful, normal...

1490
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:29,930
and better.

1491
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:31,939
The president had not read it...

1492
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:35,033
not even the summary of a page
that so much cost us...

1493
01:18:35,110 --> 01:18:38,375
because we limited everything to only one page.

1494
01:18:38,447 --> 01:18:40,506
Did the president read not even the summary?

1495
01:18:40,582 --> 01:18:41,582
This way it is.

1496
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:45,986
They only...

1497
01:18:46,054 --> 01:18:48,147
they were imagining the conditions.

1498
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:50,783
How many people in Iraq estimate you...

1499
01:18:50,859 --> 01:18:52,019
ADVISER OF THE CPA FOR IRAQ

1500
01:18:52,094 --> 01:18:56,121
... what have they taken part in the rebellion?

1501
01:18:56,198 --> 01:18:59,429
At any level, if it is alone supporting...

1502
01:18:59,501 --> 01:19:01,628
providing secret storages...

1503
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:04,797
possibly more than 100.000 persons.

1504
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:07,467
Mosul, Iraq. On December 9, 2004

1505
01:19:08,276 --> 01:19:12,508
Two cars entered
in the district of Yarmouk.

1506
01:19:12,581 --> 01:19:14,515
There were Americans inside.

1507
01:19:14,583 --> 01:19:17,017
They all died, all.

1508
01:19:18,653 --> 01:19:21,281
In spite of the intensification
of the rebellion...

1509
01:19:21,356 --> 01:19:23,847
there were still no sufficient ones
armored cars...

1510
01:19:23,925 --> 01:19:25,688
for the soldiers of the USA in Iraq.

1511
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,353
We had not even an armored car...

1512
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:30,364
while we were in Iraq in 2003.

1513
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:33,094
We went to Iraq in 2004...

1514
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:34,931
with vehicles without shielding{armor}...

1515
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:38,734
and they were giving us teams{equipments}
of shielding{armor} in Kuwait...

1516
01:19:38,807 --> 01:19:41,799
that were like pieces
in the shape of doors without windows...

1517
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:45,506
and a moon to test of bullets, that was quite.

1518
01:19:45,580 --> 01:19:48,105
If his vehicle
it had not been armored...

1519
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:51,152
cuáI believes that it would have been
the damage of the explosive?

1520
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:52,811
I believe that it would have been mortal.

1521
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:56,085
For what us do we have
that to poke in dumps...

1522
01:19:56,158 --> 01:19:57,750
looking for metal pieces...

1523
01:19:57,826 --> 01:20:00,761
and armored glazing
to reinforce our cars?

1524
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:02,126
For what these resources{resorts}...

1525
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:03,960
are not they available{spare} for us?

1526
01:20:09,905 --> 01:20:12,373
It is a question of physics{physicist}...

1527
01:20:12,440 --> 01:20:13,907
not of money.

1528
01:20:13,975 --> 01:20:17,467
It is not a question,
on the part of the army, desire...

1529
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:21,277
it is a question
of production and aptitude to achieve it.

1530
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:24,807
There are factories of cars
that close in the USA.

1531
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:29,084
I am not an expert in factories...

1532
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:31,648
but reutilizarlas
to produce armored cars...

1533
01:20:31,726 --> 01:20:32,954
it should not be difficult.

1534
01:20:33,028 --> 01:20:35,519
You go to the war with the army that you have...

1535
01:20:35,597 --> 01:20:39,431
and the one that you would like to have,
or you would wish later.

1536
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:44,427
THE THINGS CRUMBLE

1537
01:20:44,506 --> 01:20:49,068
In November, 2004,
the Pentagon decided to attack Faluya...

1538
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:52,841
to recover the city
of the rebellion suní.

1539
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:56,714
350.000 citizens were warned
of Faluya that were leaving the city.

1540
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:07,923
The battle destroyed 70 % of the city...

1541
01:21:07,996 --> 01:21:11,193
leaving 150.000 homeless.

1542
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:14,599
In spite of the intense combats,
many insurgents escape.

1543
01:21:14,669 --> 01:21:16,637
40 marines turn out to be dead.

1544
01:21:18,673 --> 01:21:21,699
While the army of the USA.
it was worrying about Faluya...

1545
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:24,677
the militias chiítas
they were taking possession of the south of Iraq.

1546
01:21:33,388 --> 01:21:38,883
There is neither an army nor a multitude...

1547
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,019
of hundreds of persons...

1548
01:21:41,096 --> 01:21:44,532
trying to demolish or to change the situation.

1549
01:21:44,599 --> 01:21:46,567
In August, 2004...

1550
01:21:46,635 --> 01:21:49,866
the holy city of Nayaf
it is controlled by the Army of Mahdi...

1551
01:21:49,938 --> 01:21:54,136
the militia chiíta led
for Muqtada to the-Sadr.

1552
01:21:54,676 --> 01:21:58,339
Seth's section faced
to the militia of Muqtada to the-Sadr.

1553
01:21:58,413 --> 01:22:00,973
In extract, which informed us the unit{unity}...

1554
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:02,744
that we substitute it was...

1555
01:22:02,817 --> 01:22:07,720
that almost quite in Nayaf was very pacific.

1556
01:22:07,789 --> 01:22:09,984
Except 3.000 men of the militia...

1557
01:22:10,058 --> 01:22:11,650
that occupy the center of the city.

1558
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:16,629
The bullets were flying, the mortars were falling down.

1559
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:19,997
My section was the first one
in coming to the police station of police officer{police}.

1560
01:22:20,068 --> 01:22:23,834
We take positions
with the police of Iraq...

1561
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:25,873
and we defended her from the militia.

1562
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:27,602
But until ends of August...

1563
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:30,270
we did not do a large-scale assault...

1564
01:22:30,345 --> 01:22:32,905
to the ancient{former} city of Nayaf
and we recover her.

1565
01:22:32,981 --> 01:22:37,748
To Muqtada to the-Sadr
he{she} was allowed to escape unharmed.

1566
01:22:37,819 --> 01:22:40,481
If the democracy
it does not help the Iraqi people...

1567
01:22:40,555 --> 01:22:42,750
the people will say:
" To the devil with the democracy.

1568
01:22:42,824 --> 01:22:44,348
" We need a strong man ".

1569
01:22:44,426 --> 01:22:46,360
And I see that this man is on having fallen down...

1570
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:48,259
and the name of to the-Sadr is Muqtada.

1571
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:52,858
I believe that it is not the best election
as future leader of Iraq.

1572
01:22:52,934 --> 01:22:55,732
It took part in the deliberations...

1573
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:59,900
on if capturing
or to kill Muqtada to the-Sadr?

1574
01:22:59,975 --> 01:23:01,772
Yes, this way it is.

1575
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:04,209
We were considering it a troublemaker...

1576
01:23:04,279 --> 01:23:05,507
and a source of problems?

1577
01:23:05,580 --> 01:23:07,707
Certainly, we wanted to arrest it.

1578
01:23:07,782 --> 01:23:11,013
Everything turns concerning the matter
of the force of the troops.

1579
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:12,383
The army did not have to relax...

1580
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:14,046
of his principal mission...

1581
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:16,784
to begin what would have been
a battle cuts...

1582
01:23:16,858 --> 01:23:20,851
although difficult, and surely bloody...

1583
01:23:20,929 --> 01:23:24,626
and this is what was decided in the end.

1584
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:29,500
After the elections in Iraq,
on December 15, 2005...

1585
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:31,232
the Iraqi Close{United} Alliance...

1586
01:23:31,306 --> 01:23:34,673
with the party of Muqtada to the-Sadr
as principal participant...

1587
01:23:34,743 --> 01:23:38,201
it occupied almost the half of the benches
in the central government of Iraq.

1588
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:40,747
It is not easy for a marine that someone...

1589
01:23:40,815 --> 01:23:45,275
He{It} and his militia murdered
to some of my friends...

1590
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:49,153
and to see it rising in the politics of Iraq...

1591
01:23:49,224 --> 01:23:50,282
it is frustrating.

1592
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:54,084
Another group chiíta
of the alliance of Sadr it is SCIRI...

1593
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:57,654
the Supreme Advice{Council}
for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq.

1594
01:23:57,732 --> 01:24:00,326
The leaders of the SCIRI
they lived through 20 years in Iran...

1595
01:24:00,402 --> 01:24:02,495
and they are, often, pro Iranian.

1596
01:24:02,570 --> 01:24:04,003
These groups chiítas...

1597
01:24:04,072 --> 01:24:06,939
that sometimes fight against them themselves...

1598
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:09,704
they are allied politically
against the groups suníes.

1599
01:24:09,778 --> 01:24:11,769
The Army of Mahdi de Muqtada to the-Sadr...

1600
01:24:11,846 --> 01:24:15,111
it continues the clashes
with the forces of the USA.

1601
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:17,014
The level of activity that is seen today...

1602
01:24:17,085 --> 01:24:20,077
from a point
of military sight it will diminish.

1603
01:24:20,155 --> 01:24:23,682
I believe that it is the last breath
of the rebellion, if they allow it to me.

1604
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:28,388
When secretary Rumsfeld
and the vice-president Cheney...

1605
01:24:28,463 --> 01:24:31,557
they commented that the rebellion
it was drooping...

1606
01:24:31,633 --> 01:24:33,965
that were alone a few rebels...

1607
01:24:34,035 --> 01:24:37,903
you knew that the estimation
of the intelligence...

1608
01:24:37,972 --> 01:24:41,100
was it already indicating that they were wrong?

1609
01:24:41,176 --> 01:24:43,110
It had gone to Iraq eight times...

1610
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:45,976
he{she} knew the facts on the area.

1611
01:24:46,047 --> 01:24:47,878
They will have to speak and judged...

1612
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:49,473
for his words and actions...

1613
01:24:49,551 --> 01:24:51,485
but I knew what the facts were.

1614
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:56,820
Dick Cheney and Donald Rumsfeld
they refused to be interviewed.

1615
01:24:57,192 --> 01:25:00,491
At the beginning of 2005,
the administration began little by little...

1616
01:25:00,562 --> 01:25:02,860
to correct some of his errors.

1617
01:25:02,931 --> 01:25:05,456
It accelerated the training
of the Iraqi army...

1618
01:25:05,533 --> 01:25:07,330
and it named a Moslem diplomat...

1619
01:25:07,402 --> 01:25:10,064
Zalmay Khalilzad, like ambassador.

1620
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:11,969
In June, 2006...

1621
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:14,634
ambassador Khalilzad sent
a cable with bad predictions...

1622
01:25:14,709 --> 01:25:16,643
to Condoleezza Rice.

1623
01:25:16,711 --> 01:25:18,110
The Iraqis of the embassy...

1624
01:25:18,179 --> 01:25:20,340
they were not saying to his families
where were they working...

1625
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:22,383
for fear of being murdered.

1626
01:25:22,450 --> 01:25:25,510
They were wondering what would happen{pass}
if the Americans were going away.

1627
01:25:25,587 --> 01:25:29,148
Many{Many people} were preparing themselves
for your own sequestrations.

1628
01:25:29,224 --> 01:25:30,350
Six months later...

1629
01:25:30,425 --> 01:25:33,588
the day after the republicans
they were losing the control of the Congress...

1630
01:25:33,661 --> 01:25:37,222
the president Bush announces
the resignation of Rumsfeld.

1631
01:25:37,298 --> 01:25:39,732
The new secretary of Defense,
Robert Gates...

1632
01:25:39,801 --> 01:25:43,032
he is a pragmatist that
he{she} has criticized the war privately.

1633
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:45,937
I do changes
in the secretariat of Defense...

1634
01:25:46,007 --> 01:25:48,635
to give a new perspective
on how obtaining anything...

1635
01:25:48,710 --> 01:25:50,735
that almost we all wish, victory.

1636
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:55,813
THE CHAOS

1637
01:26:06,728 --> 01:26:08,787
When Rumsfeld is replaced...

1638
01:26:08,863 --> 01:26:10,797
Iraq is out of control.

1639
01:26:10,865 --> 01:26:13,561
The country is every time
more dominated by militias...

1640
01:26:13,635 --> 01:26:16,627
insurgents, criminals and commanders.

1641
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:19,673
The mixed areas are purged
in ethnic purges.

1642
01:26:19,741 --> 01:26:22,141
The militias chiítas
they have infiltrated into the police...

1643
01:26:22,210 --> 01:26:24,405
using them for sectarian slaughters.

1644
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:26,106
The sequestrations and the violent deaths...

1645
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:29,173
they come to several hundreds per day.

1646
01:26:29,951 --> 01:26:31,976
They kidnapped them on the market...

1647
01:26:32,053 --> 01:26:33,315
and they executed them.

1648
01:26:33,388 --> 01:26:35,151
They executed them for being suníes.

1649
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:37,054
There are many types of militia.

1650
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,285
The militia of Mahdi...

1651
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:40,387
MINISTER OF HUMAN RIGHTS IN IRAQ
... the militia of Badr...

1652
01:26:40,461 --> 01:26:43,191
there are many militias in this country.

1653
01:26:43,264 --> 01:26:45,755
They all are very democratic...

1654
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:50,532
to arrest and to kill the people.

1655
01:26:50,605 --> 01:26:53,768
The safety is the awful
in many quarters...

1656
01:26:53,841 --> 01:26:56,969
with the permanent threat
of cars bomb and home-loving explosives.

1657
01:26:57,045 --> 01:26:59,570
A car bomb exploited just there.

1658
01:26:59,647 --> 01:27:02,275
I was here, my father here
and my brother there.

1659
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:04,443
The explosion killed my brother.

1660
01:27:04,519 --> 01:27:06,510
And to all around him{you}.

1661
01:27:06,588 --> 01:27:10,649
Cars bomb,
home-loving explosives, sequestrations...

1662
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:12,852
There are a lot of ways of dying.

1663
01:27:12,927 --> 01:27:16,829
The sequestrations, measured certifications{certificates}
of gangsters to obtain money.

1664
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:20,390
They kidnapped a child opposite to the hotel...

1665
01:27:20,468 --> 01:27:22,959
a car stopped, seized the child and went away.

1666
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:24,595
They ask the parents for a rescue...

1667
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,333
that they will have to obtain in one week.

1668
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:29,638
A few sequestrations are not alone,
they are hundred of them...

1669
01:27:29,711 --> 01:27:31,802
ADVISER OF SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR DE IRAQ
... and it is overwhelming.

1670
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:33,870
Where did they kidnap them?

1671
01:27:33,948 --> 01:27:37,850
They took them of his shops,
to the four.

1672
01:27:37,919 --> 01:27:41,218
We went to the office of Sadr
to ask him and to request him...

1673
01:27:41,289 --> 01:27:43,052
but they said that they were not they.

1674
01:27:43,124 --> 01:27:45,149
There is a persons' avalanche...

1675
01:27:45,226 --> 01:27:47,990
asking for help or...

1676
01:27:48,062 --> 01:27:50,553
or that soon stop asking for help.

1677
01:27:50,632 --> 01:27:53,260
Why to denounce the police?
One, we do not trust in them.

1678
01:27:53,334 --> 01:27:55,325
Two, perhaps they commit the crimes.

1679
01:27:55,403 --> 01:27:58,736
His uniforms were proliferating
for all places.

1680
01:27:58,806 --> 01:28:01,070
There are many elements of looting...

1681
01:28:01,142 --> 01:28:04,839
and the people who makes to happen{pass}
for safety services.

1682
01:28:04,912 --> 01:28:08,814
They arrest the people due to many sources.

1683
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:10,350
Do not know who are.

1684
01:28:10,418 --> 01:28:13,785
False positions of control
where they stop{detain} the people...

1685
01:28:13,855 --> 01:28:17,791
to verify his identity
and to see if they are chiítas...

1686
01:28:17,859 --> 01:28:21,317
suníes, Kurds, Arabs{Arabic}, and then...

1687
01:28:21,396 --> 01:28:24,365
they kidnap them or kill them there same.

1688
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:28,764
When I say goodbye of my husband...

1689
01:28:28,836 --> 01:28:30,770
I always believe that I will not return.

1690
01:28:34,175 --> 01:28:38,271
At the end of 2006,
Baghdad was a lawlessness.

1691
01:28:38,346 --> 01:28:41,076
The army of the USA.
it was controlling the Green space...

1692
01:28:41,149 --> 01:28:43,674
and the area of the airport of Baghdad.

1693
01:28:43,751 --> 01:28:47,551
The safety forces of Iraq
they were controlling the East and the south.

1694
01:28:47,622 --> 01:28:49,112
The militias suníes were controlling...

1695
01:28:49,190 --> 01:28:51,784
several quarters suníes important.

1696
01:28:51,859 --> 01:28:55,590
The Army of Mahdi de Muqtada to the-Sadr
it was dominating extensive areas...

1697
01:28:55,663 --> 01:28:58,928
including the enormous district chiíta
of the city of Sadr.

1698
01:28:59,000 --> 01:29:02,299
The militia chiíta rival of the SCIRI,
the Brigade Badr...

1699
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:04,600
it was controlling the areas chiítas rich.

1700
01:29:04,672 --> 01:29:07,903
The organizations of quarter
they were controlling many small areas.

1701
01:29:07,975 --> 01:29:12,241
Extensive areas were remaining without controlling.

1702
01:29:14,615 --> 01:29:18,142
CONSEQUENCES

1703
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:19,584
Of a realized study...

1704
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:21,383
for the catedrática
of Harvard Linda Bilmas...

1705
01:29:21,456 --> 01:29:23,856
and the winner of a nobel Joseph Stiglitz...

1706
01:29:23,925 --> 01:29:29,090
at the beginning of 2007, the USA there was
spent 379.000 million dollars...

1707
01:29:29,163 --> 01:29:31,393
directly in the war of Iraq.

1708
01:29:31,466 --> 01:29:36,028
The future operations are estimated
in approximately 389.000 million dollars.

1709
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:38,004
The cost of the care to the veterans...

1710
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:40,632
and the loss of productiveness
as that they serve in Iraq...

1711
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:43,074
it costs 482.000 million dollars.

1712
01:29:43,144 --> 01:29:46,511
The cost of the demobilization
and substitution of the team{equipment} of the army...

1713
01:29:46,581 --> 01:29:49,482
that is finished six times
more rapidly of the normal thing...

1714
01:29:49,550 --> 01:29:51,882
it is 160.000 million dollars.

1715
01:29:51,953 --> 01:29:54,478
The increase of the price
of the oil due to the war...

1716
01:29:54,555 --> 01:29:59,549
it has cost to the USA.
450.000 million dollars.

1717
01:29:59,627 --> 01:30:02,095
In whole, the economic{economical} cost of the war...

1718
01:30:02,163 --> 01:30:05,291
it is believed that it will reach
1,8 trillions of dollars.

1719
01:30:06,434 --> 01:30:09,164
I suffer...

1720
01:30:09,237 --> 01:30:12,400
migraines postraumáticas...

1721
01:30:12,473 --> 01:30:14,703
and epilepsy postraumática.

1722
01:30:17,378 --> 01:30:24,546
Sometimes, I have bad memories
of what it happened...

1723
01:30:24,619 --> 01:30:26,610
but I do not scare them.

1724
01:30:26,687 --> 01:30:28,882
Is he{she} emotionally well?

1725
01:30:28,956 --> 01:30:32,323
Sometimes, it is a little...

1726
01:30:35,229 --> 01:30:36,753
Sometimes, yes. Sometimes, not.

1727
01:30:38,232 --> 01:30:41,065
Still{Yet} difficult meeting to treat with...

1728
01:30:41,135 --> 01:30:43,069
you know already...

1729
01:30:43,137 --> 01:30:45,571
what us happened to me
and to my partner. Sometimes.

1730
01:30:47,575 --> 01:30:51,306
The big cost concerned
to the disability of the veterans...

1731
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:53,779
it is for these hundreds
of thousands of persons...

1732
01:30:53,848 --> 01:30:57,113
that they return and see
that cannot work...

1733
01:30:57,185 --> 01:30:59,380
or to expire with a work like{as} earlier...

1734
01:30:59,454 --> 01:31:03,481
because there are no same that earlier.

1735
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:05,389
What temperatures are reached here?

1736
01:31:05,460 --> 01:31:06,722
Yesterday we come to 48 grades.

1737
01:31:06,794 --> 01:31:10,025
- 48 grades?
- Yes.

1738
01:31:10,097 --> 01:31:12,588
The last contract
that signed with the government.

1739
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:13,998
Many of the units go...

1740
01:31:14,068 --> 01:31:15,695
three periods of service...

1741
01:31:15,770 --> 01:31:17,670
and some of them do not see that the end approaches.

1742
01:31:17,738 --> 01:31:19,433
They believe that they will return for his fifth one...

1743
01:31:19,507 --> 01:31:21,941
the sixth, seventh period of service
before it finishes.

1744
01:31:22,009 --> 01:31:23,772
We do not have enough troops.

1745
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:26,712
How us protegeremos
before a possible conflict in Pyongyang...

1746
01:31:26,781 --> 01:31:27,907
NORTH KOREA ANNOUNCES
NUCLEAR TESTS

1747
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:30,007
... a possible conflict with Iran...

1748
01:31:30,084 --> 01:31:32,484
other possible conflicts in the world...

1749
01:31:32,553 --> 01:31:34,612
if we have it quite overturned...

1750
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:36,748
towards Iraq and Afghanistan?

1751
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:38,792
It is curious, but Iran...

1752
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:40,122
ASSISTANT OF THE SECRETARY
OF CLINTON'S DEFENSE

1753
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:45,393
... in spite of our hate
towards the Iranian diet{regime}...

1754
01:31:45,466 --> 01:31:49,596
he is the biggest beneficiary
of the war of Iraq.

1755
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:52,571
We eliminate his enemy
historical for them...

1756
01:31:52,640 --> 01:31:56,474
and we put them to the head
of the War of the Gulf.

1757
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:59,411
When you attend a civil war like that...

1758
01:31:59,480 --> 01:32:00,777
violent and disagreeable...

1759
01:32:00,848 --> 01:32:02,713
on 20 %
of the world supply of oil...

1760
01:32:02,783 --> 01:32:04,876
that it will affect with safety
to nearby countries...

1761
01:32:04,952 --> 01:32:09,286
Iran, Saudi Arabia, Jordan,
Syria, perhaps up to Egypt.

1762
01:32:09,357 --> 01:32:14,317
If Iraq disintegrates and turns
in a field of civil war...

1763
01:32:14,395 --> 01:32:16,989
it will look alike increasingly
to a small Afghanistan.

1764
01:32:17,064 --> 01:32:21,160
It are where they will shelter
the terrorists of the whole world{everybody}.

1765
01:32:21,235 --> 01:32:25,934
If Iraq returns to
a diet{regime} islamofascista...

1766
01:32:26,007 --> 01:32:28,976
as{like} that of the talibanes in Afghanistan...

1767
01:32:29,043 --> 01:32:31,568
we will have returned
on September 10, 2001...

1768
01:32:31,646 --> 01:32:34,672
only that to major scale...

1769
01:32:34,749 --> 01:32:38,583
and with thousands of million dollars
of oil at his disposal.

1770
01:32:38,752 --> 01:32:41,744
On having begun the reconstruction...

1771
01:32:41,855 --> 01:32:43,550
we were joking...

1772
01:32:43,623 --> 01:32:45,614
with that there were 500 ways of harming it...

1773
01:32:45,692 --> 01:32:48,024
and two or three of it to do well...

1774
01:32:48,095 --> 01:32:49,619
and what we did not understand...

1775
01:32:49,696 --> 01:32:52,028
the fact is that we were going to try
these 500 forms first.

1776
01:32:52,099 --> 01:32:53,896
Why were these errors committed?

1777
01:32:53,967 --> 01:32:55,730
I do not know it.

1778
01:32:55,802 --> 01:32:59,033
I do not have it nor designs. It is disconcerting.

1779
01:33:01,608 --> 01:33:04,771
The president Bush
it disappeared in combat...

1780
01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:06,676
in the planning of the postwar period.

1781
01:33:06,747 --> 01:33:10,740
It delegated in his vice-president
and in his secretary of Defense...

1782
01:33:10,817 --> 01:33:13,513
the control of these decisions.

1783
01:33:13,587 --> 01:33:16,112
Why, if he was the president of EE.UU...

1784
01:33:16,189 --> 01:33:18,919
it would use the military force
then to feign ignorance...

1785
01:33:18,992 --> 01:33:23,326
of, essentially,
the most important aspect...

1786
01:33:23,396 --> 01:33:25,364
that is to say, the later{posterior} period?

1787
01:33:25,432 --> 01:33:26,797
Who was in charge in this war?

1788
01:33:26,867 --> 01:33:28,334
I do not want to repeat the whole list.

1789
01:33:28,401 --> 01:33:29,800
The president, the vice-president...

1790
01:33:29,870 --> 01:33:31,201
the secretary of Defense...

1791
01:33:31,271 --> 01:33:33,637
those who were surrounding them.

1792
01:33:33,707 --> 01:33:35,197
The Assessor of National Safety?

1793
01:33:35,275 --> 01:33:36,275
Skylight.

1794
01:33:36,309 --> 01:33:38,140
The vice-president?

1795
01:33:38,211 --> 01:33:39,371
Yes.

1796
01:33:39,446 --> 01:33:40,913
This was the internal team{equipment}...

1797
01:33:40,981 --> 01:33:44,075
that was planning everything that thing about the war.

1798
01:33:44,151 --> 01:33:46,585
My error was not to try to take part any more...

1799
01:33:46,653 --> 01:33:48,678
in the process of planning.

1800
01:33:48,755 --> 01:33:50,154
I see already.

1801
01:33:50,223 --> 01:33:51,952
So that the dissolution of the army...

1802
01:33:52,025 --> 01:33:53,583
had not it been a surprise?

1803
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:55,321
It might have fought a heap...

1804
01:33:55,395 --> 01:33:59,331
and even to go to judgment{opinion}.
It would have lost, but it would have gone.

1805
01:33:59,399 --> 01:34:02,027
The system should be participativo...

1806
01:34:02,102 --> 01:34:04,593
and to include the people
that is ready to say...

1807
01:34:04,671 --> 01:34:07,196
" This has no sense, mister president.

1808
01:34:07,274 --> 01:34:08,969
" It is a bad idea ".

1809
01:34:09,042 --> 01:34:11,567
I do not believe that these processes
of capture of decisions...

1810
01:34:11,645 --> 01:34:13,909
they existed in the administration of Bush.

1811
01:34:13,980 --> 01:34:16,505
I was not sorry that I was taking part...

1812
01:34:16,583 --> 01:34:19,211
in no process of capture of decisions.

1813
01:34:19,286 --> 01:34:21,982
The administration never asked...

1814
01:34:22,055 --> 01:34:25,320
no opinion poll of the population
on Iraq before the war.

1815
01:34:25,392 --> 01:34:29,488
Nobody was interested in
what the community will think?

1816
01:34:29,563 --> 01:34:31,827
I believe that it was already quite determined...

1817
01:34:31,898 --> 01:34:34,196
from the beginning.

1818
01:34:34,267 --> 01:34:38,226
Any analysis that was doing...

1819
01:34:38,305 --> 01:34:40,239
on these matters...

1820
01:34:40,307 --> 01:34:43,242
it was ignored by the managers
of the capture of decisions.

1821
01:34:43,310 --> 01:34:45,141
The vice-president Cheney has done...

1822
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:46,509
and it takes the same positions{attitudes}...

1823
01:34:46,580 --> 01:34:48,946
on the war that secretary Rumsfeld.

1824
01:34:49,015 --> 01:34:50,505
Still{Yet} does it have his entire confidence?

1825
01:34:50,584 --> 01:34:51,983
- This way it is.
- Waiting that he{it} ...?

1826
01:34:52,052 --> 01:34:53,952
The campaign was finished. This way it is.

1827
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:56,445
- Will it continue here until you should go away?
- This way it is.

1828
01:34:56,523 --> 01:35:01,085
Some nights I do not sleep very well...

1829
01:35:01,161 --> 01:35:04,255
when I blame myself for not pressing any more...

1830
01:35:04,331 --> 01:35:07,095
that should have gone,
to stamp on the door and to say...

1831
01:35:07,167 --> 01:35:08,293
" Curse, listening.

1832
01:35:08,368 --> 01:35:12,828
" It was an error. It is necessary to rectify it ".

1833
01:35:12,906 --> 01:35:16,398
But I never had the opportunity...

1834
01:35:16,476 --> 01:35:18,671
and to stamp on a door...

1835
01:35:18,745 --> 01:35:22,112
with an ambassador that,
essentially, it is...

1836
01:35:22,182 --> 01:35:24,844
the czar of Iraq.

1837
01:35:24,918 --> 01:35:28,081
It is impossible that a colonel does that.

1838
01:35:28,154 --> 01:35:30,145
It was not possible to happen{pass} beyond the entry.

1839
01:35:30,223 --> 01:35:34,353
If the one that I spoke joins,
although it is in the most minimal thing...

1840
01:35:34,427 --> 01:35:39,592
to the criticism of this administration...

1841
01:35:39,666 --> 01:35:41,429
I will feel good.

1842
01:35:41,501 --> 01:35:44,493
I do not want to say that it should have been a cash...

1843
01:35:44,571 --> 01:35:48,098
but the fact is that I cannot keep on living like that.

1844
01:35:48,174 --> 01:35:51,666
We will take to the Iraqis meal...

1845
01:35:51,745 --> 01:35:53,508
and medicines...

1846
01:35:53,580 --> 01:35:55,707
and provisions...

1847
01:35:55,782 --> 01:35:57,750
and liberate.

1848
01:36:16,636 --> 01:36:18,934
Look at what contentments!

1849
01:36:30,250 --> 01:36:33,242
It sounds as if it us was going away
to fall down the world above.

1850
01:36:37,624 --> 01:36:41,651
General Garner and I we are
promised to be employed at team{equipment}.

1851
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:44,424
WE WANT
OUR EMPLOYMENTS{JOBS} AND WAGES

1852
01:36:45,799 --> 01:36:49,030
Now there is
many ancient{former} Iraqi soldiers...

1853
01:36:49,102 --> 01:36:50,228
without employment{job}.

1854
01:36:55,075 --> 01:36:56,804
One was a " guerrilla war "...

1855
01:36:56,876 --> 01:37:00,835
the different one was a " rebellion ",
the different one was a slightly conventional " war ".

1856
01:37:04,584 --> 01:37:06,381
- Pardon?
- Impasse.

1857
01:37:08,188 --> 01:37:11,954
Not, of that another person takes charge...

1858
01:37:12,025 --> 01:37:13,219
I do not do these things.

1859
01:37:17,697 --> 01:37:19,460
I penetrate, penetrate.

1860
01:37:19,532 --> 01:37:22,933
I hear the political leaders.

1861
01:37:33,213 --> 01:37:34,703
Ah!

1862
01:37:34,781 --> 01:37:36,544
Below, below, below.

1863
01:37:36,616 --> 01:37:41,246
Some day in the future,
I will turn the sight to Iraq...

1864
01:37:41,321 --> 01:37:44,017
and I will want to see that we have obtained something...

1865
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:46,558
to be able to say...

1866
01:37:46,626 --> 01:37:48,389
that I was a part of that...

1867
01:37:48,461 --> 01:37:54,263
and that my suffering
and losses have sense.

1868
01:38:03,977 --> 01:38:09,074
If the situation improves, I will go away of Iraq.

1869
01:38:09,149 --> 01:38:11,174
I will go away, but now...

1870
01:38:11,251 --> 01:38:14,084
I am a combatant, all my life.

1871
01:38:14,154 --> 01:38:15,451
I still{yet} will not go away of Iraq.

1872
01:38:19,526 --> 01:38:21,391
It is not possible to change anything from here...

1873
01:38:21,461 --> 01:38:23,691
because it is out of control.

1874
01:38:23,763 --> 01:38:28,996
I do not have plans of future in Iraq.

1875
01:38:29,069 --> 01:38:34,905
I still{yet} do not see the light at the end of the tunnel.

1876
01:38:34,974 --> 01:38:36,464
This is what exists.

1877
01:38:36,543 --> 01:38:38,511
This way we live through it, this way we see it...

1878
01:38:38,578 --> 01:38:40,773
this way we it smell and feel it.

1879
01:38:40,847 --> 01:38:43,816
In this situation it is not possible to say:
" Let's try this...

1880
01:38:43,883 --> 01:38:46,443
" it will serve. Or this yes that will serve ". It is not like that.

1881
01:38:53,593 --> 01:38:57,256
You are saying to me that this
is it the best thing that can do the USA?

1882
01:38:57,330 --> 01:38:58,797
Not.

1883
01:38:58,865 --> 01:39:01,425
Do not say that to me,
him{her; you} do not say to the marines...

1884
01:39:01,501 --> 01:39:04,163
that fought one month in Nayaf that...

1885
01:39:04,237 --> 01:39:06,000
Do not say to me that the marines that...

1886
01:39:06,072 --> 01:39:07,562
that still fight every day in Faluya...

1887
01:39:07,640 --> 01:39:09,608
that this is the best thing
that the USA can do.

1888
01:39:12,011 --> 01:39:13,308
It angers me.
