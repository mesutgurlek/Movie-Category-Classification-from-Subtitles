What's all this?

6
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,237
They'll go as they came!

7
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,473
Anything else I can get for you Sir?

8
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,476
I'm looking for this man?

9
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:05,870
Do you know him?

10
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,829
I don't, but I'll ask.

11
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,316
Pass.

12
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:48,596
Mee too.

Either play like men here
or else if you cheat again.

00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,036
I'll trash the place.

00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,555
Come on young man.
Where did you get that from?

18
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,645
I stake all.

19
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,511

00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,671
All right.

00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,070

This is a robbery.

29
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:44,157
At least, it's an obvious robbery, Nico!

30
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:45,995

You will not get away this Knock Out Ali.

32
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,832
You will pay for this.

33
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,315
If we meet again, then Nico.

34
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:08,356
Shit. Fuck off.

35
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,005

I'm sorry.

36
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,750

37

39
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,031
Sorry. Brits after me.
If they ask point there, OK?

40
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,870
Take this. Thanks.

41
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,069
OK.

42
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,470

...from the parliament will only
accelerate the enemy occupation.

45
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,834
You're right Pasha.

46
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,752
We're well aware of it.

47
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,915
Ever since I came to Istanbul...

48
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,837
...l've been talking to deputy members.

49
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,670
My aides are also lobbying actively.

50
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:46,194
According to general opinion, it looks difficult
for Tevfik Pasha to get votes of confidence.

51
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,360
It's extremely important for the
liberation of our country that you...

52
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:52,873
...become Grand Vizier again.

53
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:57,833
Frankly, my being Grand Vizier again
is not sufficient Pasha.

54
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:04,556
It is also a necessity that you become
War Minister in my cabinet...

55
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:07,478
...for the liberation of our country.

56
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:14,596
I will carry out any duty given to me with
utmost care and attention if it helps Pasha.

57
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,672
Now, with your permission, I have
to check the local situation.

58
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,952
May God help the people of this country.

59
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,238
This has been a nuisance for you.

60
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,793

61
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:07,560

62
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,438
Awful.

63
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,752
With your permission.

64
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,389
You see?

65
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:59,029
We have bothered yourwife
by talking shop.

66
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,155
That's bad.

67
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,238
Oh God... What's going on?

68
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,559
Who do you think you are?

69
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,390
Ssshht...

70
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,829
Come on wake up.

71
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,470
Oh...

72
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:35,988
Pull yourself together ha?

73
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,629
Now speak up, who are you? Speak.

74
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,476
Okay... My name's Jerar.

75
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,348
I'm the son of a Smyrnian
family emigrated from France.

76
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,917
I am a seaman, but I do acrobatics as well.

77
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,079
What do you want you bugger?

78
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:02,877
Huh?

79
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:05,549
You were stealing a boat.

80
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,516
I am a guard.

81
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,313
Tell the truth.

82
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,074
You were following me.

83
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,192
Okay. Look I'm the guard here.

84
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,795

As forfollowing you...

87
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,829
That's right I was someone called Guro
from the French...

88

89
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:25,876
Guro?

90
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:27,396
Yes!

91
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,515
It seems this Guro has
got a score to settle.

92
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,352
He'll pay a lot in return for you.

93
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,237
Ok then...

94
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,256

After that we'll go...

95

...and you will get your money, ok?

96
00:11:42,081 --> 00:11:46,677
Eh no. No way. We all know
there must be an alternative.

97
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:51,577
I'll earn my money some otherway.

98
00:11:51,741 --> 00:11:52,969
You are brave, man!

99
00:11:54,581 --> 00:12:00,019
Let me come with you? Was it Kalamis?
OK? Let's make amends.

100
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:03,814
So be it. If you insist.

101
00:12:05,101 --> 00:12:07,490

Nothing... it's nothing!

Yes! Something did happen.
And how!

Unfortunately against us Pasha!

Fear cannot save you.

No man. I was in a clash again. Look at us?
British soldiers are all around...

...I suppose you're not aware?
The Brits are all over.

Because of them I couldn't eat today.

That's why I went fishing for dinner.

164
00:20:02,421 --> 00:20:05,094
Anyway, you weren't around.
I thought something happened.

Is there a time when nothing happens?

166
00:20:08,181 --> 00:20:08,852
How is it?

167
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:10,736
Can we cross over?

168
00:20:13,501 --> 00:20:14,172
As always.

169
00:20:27,301 --> 00:20:31,533
I spent many years
and of course a lot of effort.

170
00:20:37,741 --> 00:20:38,696
My God!

171
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:42,889
As an officer I travelled all over
the Middle East but I never drank...

172
00:20:43,261 --> 00:20:48,051
...coffee as delicious as this.

173
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:14,696
There's no hurry.

174
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:17,259
We are still here.

175
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:31,854
What are these buggers doing?

176
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:35,492
Have the bastards started
the occupation here?

177
00:21:43,421 --> 00:21:44,410
Thank you...

178
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:30,613
Catch him.

179
00:22:30,781 --> 00:22:31,019
Shut up!

180
00:22:31,181 --> 00:22:31,931
Catch him.

181
00:22:36,181 --> 00:22:37,978
Damn it! It's not loaded! Run.

182
00:23:06,981 --> 00:23:07,458
Jerar!

183
00:23:09,501 --> 00:23:10,013
Jerar!

184
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:11,653
Jerar!

185
00:23:12,101 --> 00:23:13,250
Where the hell are you?

186
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:22,256
Oh, God. What an acrobat?!

187
00:23:22,581 --> 00:23:24,094
You go Ali... I'll follow.

188
00:23:24,341 --> 00:23:25,057
You bastard!

189
00:23:26,701 --> 00:23:28,851
This is enough, be quick more's coming!

190
00:23:29,061 --> 00:23:30,016
Ok, ok.

191
00:23:32,581 --> 00:23:33,461
Come on man.

192
00:23:33,496 --> 00:23:34,211
Ok, ok.

193
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:41,973
Untie it.

194
00:23:42,261 --> 00:23:43,091
Down!

195
00:23:47,581 --> 00:23:48,331
Son of a bitch!

196
00:23:48,901 --> 00:23:51,620
Wow! Looks like I owe you my life.

197
00:23:52,261 --> 00:23:53,774
Come on man! There are more.

198
00:23:53,941 --> 00:23:54,771
Come on.

199
00:23:59,341 --> 00:24:00,091
Give it.

200
00:24:06,741 --> 00:24:08,174
Did you see her?

201
00:24:51,101 --> 00:24:52,250
May God be with you all!

202
00:24:52,581 --> 00:24:53,411
You too.

203
00:24:55,981 --> 00:24:57,300
How are you?

204
00:24:58,021 --> 00:24:59,170
Not good master...

205
00:25:00,581 --> 00:25:04,415
They put us in wagons in
Eskiþehir then left us here.

206
00:25:05,941 --> 00:25:06,930
We've been dumped, master.

207
00:25:08,101 --> 00:25:09,454
Where are you from?

208
00:25:10,181 --> 00:25:10,877
Sivas.

209
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:11,573
You?

210
00:25:11,741 --> 00:25:12,412
Van!

211
00:25:13,501 --> 00:25:14,377
Erzurum!

212
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:22,974
You take this for yourway back home.

213
00:25:23,861 --> 00:25:25,453
It was already a gift.

214
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:26,577
Thank you Sir...

215
00:25:32,901 --> 00:25:34,573
Take it all, share it with yourfriends!

216
00:25:34,701 --> 00:25:35,213
Thanks sir!

217
00:25:35,341 --> 00:25:36,057
Not at all.

218
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,058
Not at all.

219
00:25:39,181 --> 00:25:40,534
May God help you!

220
00:25:41,061 --> 00:25:42,130
You too Sir.

221
00:25:56,941 --> 00:26:01,093
What did you say bastard?
You're on Ottoman soil.

222
00:26:01,181 --> 00:26:03,012
Is it right that you speak English here?

223
00:26:03,341 --> 00:26:04,137
Identity...

224
00:26:05,381 --> 00:26:06,655
Haaa... Identity!

225
00:26:07,981 --> 00:26:08,891
Identity!

226
00:26:10,781 --> 00:26:12,533
Hold on, where is it?

227
00:26:12,741 --> 00:26:15,858
Yes, I'll give you an Ottoman one.

228
00:26:52,621 --> 00:26:53,940
What's up? Can't you sleep again?

229
00:26:55,341 --> 00:26:57,650
Normal! Nowadays things
happened that bothered you.

230
00:26:58,741 --> 00:27:03,531
Of course... Someone who
falls in love can't sleep.

231
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:06,740
What do you think I am?

232
00:27:07,141 --> 00:27:10,741
Yes, I might have
loved him in the past, but now I will not...

233
00:27:10,776 --> 00:27:12,732
...do anything to stain my honor.

234
00:27:13,141 --> 00:27:17,339
I'm yourwife, whether I like it or not.

235
00:27:52,061 --> 00:27:54,416
Oh God! What's the hussy thrown now!

236
00:27:54,621 --> 00:27:56,532
Enough cursing þsmail Bey!

237
00:27:57,741 --> 00:27:59,459
This isn't a Tatavla brothel!

238
00:28:00,901 --> 00:28:06,976
Once he leaves here, he
will go straight there.

239
00:28:07,061 --> 00:28:08,460
No, I won't doctor...

240
00:28:09,101 --> 00:28:10,659
Come on Nadya throw the dice...

241
00:28:16,381 --> 00:28:22,058
Oh my God, For God's sake! Let's play!

242
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:34,099
It's the middle of the night.

243
00:28:34,981 --> 00:28:36,733
The café's closed, go.

244
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:39,220
Osman bey knows me.

245
00:28:39,301 --> 00:28:39,892
Open the door.

246
00:28:40,541 --> 00:28:43,772
At this hour even for the Vizier,
I cannot disturb him. Go away!

247
00:28:44,461 --> 00:28:45,576
I said 'open up' bastard!

248
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:46,571
Fuck of you!

249
00:28:51,181 --> 00:28:55,572
Did a bomb drop then?
What is it?

250
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:14,981
Get me Osman Bey!

251
00:29:15,016 --> 00:29:15,946
Bismillah.

252
00:29:15,981 --> 00:29:19,257
Oi you! What's going on? What a racket?

253
00:29:19,901 --> 00:29:22,461
Are you trying to destroy my business?

254
00:29:23,541 --> 00:29:24,860
Someone barged in.

255
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:28,098
We'll throw'm out.
You go and rest Chief!

256
00:29:28,221 --> 00:29:29,017
Who is he?

257
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:34,731
Who is this brave lad entering my
place beating my men single handed?

258
00:29:37,341 --> 00:29:41,129
Ali! Knock Out Ali!
My son!

259
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:44,051
He is wounded.

260
00:29:44,461 --> 00:29:46,975
Hurry, take him up... Kelle help.

261
00:29:47,861 --> 00:29:49,692
Nadya take care of him.

262
00:30:03,021 --> 00:30:04,454
Is this the guy you had trouble with?

263
00:30:09,901 --> 00:30:10,856
Yes sir!

264
00:30:13,941 --> 00:30:19,254
I am close to you Knock Out Ali.

265
00:30:20,941 --> 00:30:23,409
Agh...

266
00:30:28,981 --> 00:30:29,857
Be patient my lad.

267
00:30:30,501 --> 00:30:31,775
Almost finished.

268
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:40,013
Wow, look at this.

269
00:30:40,821 --> 00:30:43,255
Its like a boar bullet.

270
00:30:46,341 --> 00:30:47,171
Doktor!

271
00:30:47,501 --> 00:30:48,331
Yes...

272
00:30:52,981 --> 00:30:55,146
Agh...

273
00:30:55,181 --> 00:30:59,697
Now bandage... done. Aghhh.

274
00:31:02,141 --> 00:31:04,371
You've knocked out this strong man.

275
00:31:05,181 --> 00:31:07,012
This took long.

276
00:31:07,581 --> 00:31:10,778
His endurance so far is a miracle.

277
00:31:11,901 --> 00:31:14,859
Come on guys be quick.
They might get here.

278
00:31:15,381 --> 00:31:16,860
Take Ali out by the back door.

279
00:31:17,821 --> 00:31:18,492
I can get up.

280
00:31:19,101 --> 00:31:21,456
No, not like that.

281
00:31:21,741 --> 00:31:23,586
He can bleed internally.

282
00:31:23,621 --> 00:31:25,532
Ok, ok. We'll think of something.

283
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:27,298
Damn it.

284
00:31:27,381 --> 00:31:28,450
Oh God...

285
00:31:29,421 --> 00:31:31,571
Osman bey, Brits are at the door.

286
00:31:31,661 --> 00:31:32,776
Go keep them busy.

287
00:31:32,901 --> 00:31:33,386
Ok.

288
00:31:33,421 --> 00:31:34,536
Let's go downstairs.

289
00:31:35,061 --> 00:31:35,698
Nadya you stay here.

290
00:31:38,661 --> 00:31:39,457
We're closed closed.

291
00:31:42,461 --> 00:31:44,975
We are closed man, closed now,
there are no customer.

292
00:31:48,461 --> 00:31:50,258
The British mules don't understand.

293
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:52,652
Does any of you speak their language?

294
00:31:54,101 --> 00:31:55,136
Open it!

295
00:32:02,781 --> 00:32:04,499
You bastards. How dare you try to
enterwithout getting permission?

296
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:17,650
Shit... We're caught!

297
00:32:48,461 --> 00:32:49,530
I'm fine.

298
00:32:52,501 --> 00:32:53,650
What's going on here?

299
00:33:00,901 --> 00:33:03,051
Remember that British general
I had the other day.

300
00:33:03,221 --> 00:33:03,971
Yeah!

301
00:33:04,621 --> 00:33:08,330
I kept his clothes, see, we used them.

302
00:33:09,661 --> 00:33:12,016
Ali learned English quickly!

303
00:33:12,861 --> 00:33:15,694
Well done my boy Keep on learning.

304
00:33:16,141 --> 00:33:19,213
Kelle... Get the carriage.

305
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:21,534
We are going to Emirgan...

306
00:33:39,701 --> 00:33:41,180
Who is this handsome man, Osman Bey?

307
00:33:43,301 --> 00:33:49,661
This is Knock Out Ali. The bravest man
I know. You should have been...

308
00:33:49,696 --> 00:33:51,936
...there the day I met him Nadya.

309
00:33:52,981 --> 00:33:56,212
Surrender Osman. Otherwise we will
hang you here!

310
00:34:04,901 --> 00:34:11,773
Hey, get off him.

311
00:34:13,221 --> 00:34:15,257
Do you think it's right to attack people?

312
00:34:32,741 --> 00:34:36,416
If anyone asks who did this,
tell them Knock Out Ali!

313
00:34:37,221 --> 00:34:39,337
Then we came to Tophane.

314
00:34:39,501 --> 00:34:42,538
I said let's work together he said no.

315
00:34:43,061 --> 00:34:44,176
He didn't take my offer.

316
00:34:44,821 --> 00:34:48,894
I insisted as a "loan"
he took 500 and left.

317
00:35:05,621 --> 00:35:06,451
Rest.

318
00:35:19,821 --> 00:35:23,211
He is tired... He won't wake up
for a long time...

319
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,572
I need this man Nadya.

320
00:35:28,101 --> 00:35:30,376
Whatever you do make him well.

321
00:35:30,941 --> 00:35:33,091
I found him at the right time.

322
00:35:34,941 --> 00:35:37,774
I have many good men around but
this man is different Nadya.

323
00:35:39,541 --> 00:35:42,339
It's like fire and gunpowder
together Osman Bey!

324
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:54,057
Hmm... Get him attached you ask whatever
you want. Now good-bye!

325
00:36:48,501 --> 00:36:54,212
<i>THE RAID OF THE PALIAMENTAND
THE ARRES TOF THE PARTYMEMBERS</i>

326
00:37:58,661 --> 00:38:00,014
I'm looking for him.

327
00:38:01,261 --> 00:38:04,651
He is Ali, Tahtacizade Knock Out Ali...

00:38:06,821 --> 00:38:10,814

00:38:14,781 --> 00:38:16,499

330
00:38:24,301 --> 00:38:25,734
...this will be yours.

331
00:38:33,901 --> 00:38:36,369
These are... deputies... Asking for help.

332
00:38:36,661 --> 00:38:39,255
We're in a difficult position.
We must get away.

333
00:38:39,621 --> 00:38:40,770
We need you Osman Bey...

334
00:38:41,181 --> 00:38:44,935
The British because of Armenians have
given orders to arrest MPs.

335
00:38:45,661 --> 00:38:46,980
We have to go to Anatolia.

336
00:38:47,581 --> 00:38:49,572
If not our end is the Bekiraga Squad.

337
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:56,530
I get it... Tonight a cart, with animal
skins, will set out for Bursa.

338
00:38:57,861 --> 00:39:01,376
If you'll go with the skins,
I can send you.

339
00:39:01,901 --> 00:39:03,334
May God be with you!

340
00:39:04,261 --> 00:39:05,455
Are you ready to go?

341
00:39:05,661 --> 00:39:06,616
We are sir.

342
00:39:16,341 --> 00:39:18,571
Let's find a place to hide you.

343
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:25,297
Why does Osman Bey take money from them?

344
00:39:26,141 --> 00:39:27,733
They're in a difficult position.

345
00:39:28,421 --> 00:39:29,649
Is there anotherway?

346
00:39:29,901 --> 00:39:34,736
He has men working for him,
there are so many orphans...

347
00:39:35,101 --> 00:39:39,891
...under his care. Anyone with problems
runs to him. Money is necessary.

348
00:39:41,821 --> 00:39:48,772
Don't forget his sick daughter in Italy, being
treated. He sends her lots of money.

349
00:39:52,221 --> 00:39:58,581
Plus these men are rich men. Union and
Progress members. Running to Anatolia.

350
00:39:58,616 --> 00:40:02,494
No need for money there.
Would they choose life, or money?

351
00:40:03,261 --> 00:40:04,899
Yes, I suppose you're right...

352
00:40:06,781 --> 00:40:08,931
Come on, sit down. Don't tire yourself.

353
00:40:09,261 --> 00:40:10,614
Let me check yourwound.

354
00:40:24,461 --> 00:40:26,213
Why do you run away like this?

355
00:40:28,621 --> 00:40:29,656
From Mr. Guro!

356
00:40:30,221 --> 00:40:31,097
Who is that?

357
00:40:31,461 --> 00:40:34,737
Mr. Guro, my sports teacher at the Academy.

358
00:40:35,181 --> 00:40:36,933
Would one run away from a teacher?

359
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:41,460
When necessary, he would!

360
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:10,466
Good... Keep your guard up. Nice punches.
You may even become...

361
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:15,780
...a world champion but... pass your French
exams or they'll kick you out.

362
00:41:16,901 --> 00:41:21,179
Hey Guro... why don't I teach him French?

363
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,300
Who was Kolet?

364
00:41:28,541 --> 00:41:30,461
Guro's young wife!

365
00:41:30,496 --> 00:41:31,371
Oh!

366
00:41:31,821 --> 00:41:35,291
Well, did she manage to teach you?

367
00:41:37,581 --> 00:41:38,457
And How!

368
00:41:44,981 --> 00:41:45,618
The neck...

369
00:41:47,701 --> 00:41:50,090
The arm...

370
00:41:52,581 --> 00:41:54,617
The leg...

371
00:41:59,421 --> 00:42:00,979
Eye.

372
00:42:02,261 --> 00:42:04,729
Eya.

373
00:42:08,621 --> 00:42:11,135
Eye.

374
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:16,330
Hand.

375
00:42:17,341 --> 00:42:17,978
Hend.

376
00:42:18,541 --> 00:42:20,054
Hand.

377
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:21,737
Breast.

378
00:42:23,981 --> 00:42:24,970
I know that!

379
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:27,177
Lips.

380
00:42:30,741 --> 00:42:31,491
Again?

381
00:42:31,781 --> 00:42:33,772
Yes! Of course!

382
00:43:03,821 --> 00:43:05,781
Besides French Kolet taught me the
intricacies of the art of...

383
00:43:05,816 --> 00:43:12,539
...love making. But one day...
Guro came home early...

384
00:43:12,861 --> 00:43:13,737
Oh Shit.

385
00:43:14,581 --> 00:43:18,460
I see...
You ran away to escape from him.

386
00:43:20,141 --> 00:43:21,972
Why did you run away from the Navy?

387
00:43:23,181 --> 00:43:27,697
In order to protect me from Guro,
I was assigned to the battleship Yavuz.

388
00:43:29,021 --> 00:43:30,898
<i>GERMAN WARSHIP GOEBEN
WHICH WAS GIVEN TO TURKISH FLEET</i>

389
00:43:31,021 --> 00:43:33,137
The Germans were in command of the ship.

390
00:43:35,381 --> 00:43:36,575
We sailed to the Black Sea.

391
00:43:37,461 --> 00:43:40,100
Before we knew what happened
Germans bombed Odessa...

392
00:43:41,901 --> 00:43:43,812
That night they started celebrating.

393
00:43:50,301 --> 00:43:51,700
Why don't you celebrate?

394
00:43:52,581 --> 00:43:54,253
We don't see a reason to.

395
00:43:55,141 --> 00:43:59,020
We had a victory today. We are allies.
You will have fun!

396
00:44:00,381 --> 00:44:02,178
We bombed a city without warning.

397
00:44:02,941 --> 00:44:04,579
Do you call this victory?

398
00:44:04,861 --> 00:44:07,329
Shut up. I command you.

399
00:44:08,101 --> 00:44:10,854
You cannot command me!

400
00:44:12,021 --> 00:44:13,454
Stupid!

401
00:44:14,541 --> 00:44:17,931
How dare he speak like this
and to an officer?

402
00:44:18,261 --> 00:44:19,137
You bastard!

403
00:44:25,181 --> 00:44:26,296
Don't get involved sir.

404
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:38,776
My trip is over sir.

405
00:44:44,141 --> 00:44:49,221
When that was over I came back to þstanbul
and learned that...

406
00:44:49,256 --> 00:44:51,371
...Guro is still here and looking for me.

407
00:44:51,781 --> 00:44:54,170
God, this man really hates you.

408
00:44:54,901 --> 00:44:57,266
Of course, he does...

409
00:44:57,301 --> 00:44:59,371
Later I heard Kolet had hung herself.

410
00:45:01,061 --> 00:45:02,892
And Guro is still trying to take revenge.

411
00:45:03,901 --> 00:45:06,176
Jesus! You caused the woman
to commit suicide.

412
00:45:06,261 --> 00:45:07,091
<i>No...</i>

413
00:45:07,301 --> 00:45:08,416
<i>You whore!</i>

414
00:45:16,941 --> 00:45:19,409
If you knew Kolet, you would know
she wouldn't do that.

415
00:45:20,901 --> 00:45:25,816
She was full of life and
I was certainly not herfirst lover.

416
00:45:26,781 --> 00:45:30,057
Okay, but you talk as if you were there.

417
00:45:30,221 --> 00:45:31,859
How do you know? Were you there?

418
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:35,575
During investigations they found
Kolet's skull cracked.

419
00:45:35,821 --> 00:45:36,386
Actually, her neck...

420
00:45:36,421 --> 00:45:41,131
...should have been broken. Guro talked to
his powerful friends and got away with it.

421
00:45:41,661 --> 00:45:44,937
So... first he killed his wife
now he is after me...

422
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:58,294
Don't worry, he can't find you here.

423
00:46:01,101 --> 00:46:03,171
As long as it's obvious nothing frightens me.

424
00:46:09,501 --> 00:46:10,377
Gube.

425
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:11,217
What's that?

426
00:46:11,541 --> 00:46:12,417
Lip.

427
00:47:20,381 --> 00:47:21,177
Yorgo!

428
00:47:21,941 --> 00:47:22,851
What is it?

429
00:47:24,821 --> 00:47:25,458
Who is he?

430
00:47:25,941 --> 00:47:26,737
What about him?

431
00:47:27,021 --> 00:47:29,819
A man called Guro at the French Consulate
is looking for him.

432
00:47:30,181 --> 00:47:30,977
What will he do?

433
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:32,570
He will pay a lot if we take him alive.

434
00:47:38,901 --> 00:47:40,300
Welcome. Is there a problem?

435
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,899
No no... No problem at all...

436
00:47:44,901 --> 00:47:47,734
How can I trouble a beautiful woman
like you?

437
00:47:48,461 --> 00:47:50,179
I wanted to see you.

438
00:47:53,621 --> 00:48:01,301
My wife has been ill for years.
Your husband as well.

439
00:48:02,661 --> 00:48:04,413
We have same problems.

440
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:10,741
Well, Dimitri Bey is not at home. And I have
to go to see a sick friend. So excuse me.

441
00:48:10,776 --> 00:48:14,017
Ah, it's not important. I'll come again...

442
00:48:14,781 --> 00:48:22,096
I'm sure you know a man who is
abroad feels lonely.

443
00:48:23,621 --> 00:48:29,298
BRITISH COMMINICATION ROOM

444
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:38,333
MAJOR BENNET'S OFFICE

445
00:48:45,101 --> 00:48:46,500
Welcome Kara Necati.

446
00:48:56,101 --> 00:48:56,977
Understood?

447
00:48:57,141 --> 00:48:57,812
Yes sir!

448
00:49:06,181 --> 00:49:09,916
Damn it. I wish we could print this photo much
larger so that...

449
00:49:09,951 --> 00:49:13,652
...British bastards see the bloody Greeks
Black Sea murders.

450
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:25,340
Kill the Turks!

451
00:49:25,781 --> 00:49:31,856
Let's kill those bastards who spill
the innocents' blood. Off we go!

452
00:50:04,621 --> 00:50:10,178
Pasha, as I saw in Friday's procession,
the Sultan looks hopeless.

453
00:50:10,213 --> 00:50:15,735
This nation now needs a new leader.
My army in Erzurum is ready.

454
00:50:16,941 --> 00:50:21,298
I will move my 20th corps to Ankara.
My soldiers are also ready.

455
00:50:24,821 --> 00:50:30,866
Kazim, Ali Fuat! A strong army is vital.
However, our soldiers...

456
00:50:30,901 --> 00:50:35,941
...are fighting for years. They are tired.
I heard that there'll be an opening...

457
00:50:35,976 --> 00:50:41,698
for an Army Inspector up north.
By using this I hope to go to Anatolia.

458
00:50:42,861 --> 00:50:49,812
Let's not forget, if we cannot convince this
great nation, we cannot succeed.

459
00:50:51,621 --> 00:50:56,092
I mean first we must get strength
from all our people.

460
00:50:59,581 --> 00:51:05,770
Gentlemen, Istanbul is under British
occupation for some time.

461
00:51:07,781 --> 00:51:13,890
Therefore a number of secret organizations
sprang up. Among them we have...

462
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:23,012
...our organised police department as well as
those set up by minorities.

463
00:51:24,981 --> 00:51:32,661
Organizations are not only official but also
underground. The Dardanelles hero...

464
00:51:33,221 --> 00:51:38,693
...Mustafa Kemal Pasha is going to
Samsun as army inspector.

465
00:51:40,621 --> 00:51:45,058
There will be secret meetings these days
where he will be staying.

466
00:51:46,021 --> 00:51:53,580
Both occupying forces and minority
organizations may cause interference.

467
00:51:53,615 --> 00:52:01,140
Osman Bey, that's your province.
You will ensure security in that area.

468
00:52:01,381 --> 00:52:02,211
I will sir.

469
00:52:08,301 --> 00:52:18,700
OFFICE OF THE DEFENCE MINISTRY You Ask for the
much authority Kemal Pasha... They won't accept.

470
00:52:19,501 --> 00:52:25,417
Let us send our official request as we want,
if they don't approve, we can talk later...

471
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:50,052
Don't forget, a visa needs to be obtained
from the British Liaison Office.

472
00:52:50,581 --> 00:52:51,809
I'm aware Pasha!

473
00:52:53,741 --> 00:52:58,053
In that case you have some future plans.

474
00:53:00,021 --> 00:53:02,376
General staff officers always make plans!

475
00:53:10,861 --> 00:53:12,135
Wonderful man, eh good!

476
00:53:18,261 --> 00:53:19,895
Is this enough?

477
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,530
Ok, enough.

478
00:53:22,341 --> 00:53:24,013
Here comes Osman bey.

479
00:53:28,661 --> 00:53:31,334
Ali! Come boy...

480
00:53:31,981 --> 00:53:33,050
I will talk to you.

481
00:53:33,941 --> 00:53:36,409
Kelle you go and get ready.

482
00:53:37,661 --> 00:53:39,253
All right Osman bey.

483
00:53:43,501 --> 00:53:46,618
Ali, you were here for a long time.

484
00:53:47,261 --> 00:53:49,536
You don't know what's going on.

485
00:53:50,581 --> 00:53:54,176
Nowadays, British scoundrels
increased pressure.

486
00:53:57,101 --> 00:54:05,816
May be you are aware. We haven't been idle.
We have an important duty tonight.

487
00:54:07,301 --> 00:54:11,089
We will protect Mustafa
Kemal's house with friends.

488
00:54:13,381 --> 00:54:15,212
I need you tonight Ali.

489
00:54:16,181 --> 00:54:17,250
Anything you say.

490
00:54:17,781 --> 00:54:18,930
I owe you my life.

491
00:54:47,981 --> 00:54:51,530
Kelle you take your men go to that corner.

492
00:54:59,181 --> 00:55:03,971
Iskelet you go to the other corner.
Keep you eyes peeled.

493
00:55:04,341 --> 00:55:05,376
No problem Osman Bey!

494
00:55:12,181 --> 00:55:13,057
Welcome gentlemen.

495
00:55:13,581 --> 00:55:15,014
Please take a seat.

496
00:55:20,621 --> 00:55:23,089
There is an important subject
I want to share with you.

497
00:55:32,621 --> 00:55:36,091
Ali I fear there is something wrong.

498
00:55:36,181 --> 00:55:37,409
Let's go and check.

499
00:55:43,901 --> 00:55:44,777
This way.

500
00:55:48,061 --> 00:55:50,821
What happened? Is there a problem?
Why did you whistle?

501
00:55:50,856 --> 00:55:52,174
No sir. I swear I didn't.

502
00:55:53,341 --> 00:55:54,012
Very strange...

503
00:55:54,861 --> 00:55:55,737
May all go well brother.

504
00:55:56,381 --> 00:55:56,972
Thank you.

505
00:55:57,101 --> 00:55:58,250
I'm looking for an address.

506
00:55:58,981 --> 00:55:59,811
How can I help?

507
00:56:04,301 --> 00:56:07,020
I found the key. Ok.

508
00:56:09,061 --> 00:56:11,370
We left the house unguarded sir,
let's go back.

509
00:56:12,141 --> 00:56:13,017
Don't leave here.

510
00:56:15,221 --> 00:56:20,056
Gentlemen. As you know I was appointed
as inspector to the 9th Army.

511
00:56:21,301 --> 00:56:26,136
And you all as my quarter officers
shall stay at my side.

512
00:56:34,941 --> 00:56:36,135
What happened to the guards?

513
00:56:36,981 --> 00:56:38,050
Maybe they went in.

514
00:56:39,261 --> 00:56:42,861
Thh... I don't like this...
You wait here. I'll go.

515
00:56:42,896 --> 00:56:45,170
Hey, be careful.

516
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:45,938
Don't worry...

517
00:56:56,021 --> 00:56:56,976
Damn it.

518
00:57:00,621 --> 00:57:05,741
The government in otherwords Palace
has assigned us the following.

519
00:57:07,221 --> 00:57:10,418
Greeks in the Black Sea region
have been rebelling for some time.

520
00:57:11,901 --> 00:57:18,454
The Turks living in that region have quite
rightly reacted and fought back against this.

521
00:57:20,501 --> 00:57:24,941
Our duty is to restrain and hold back
the locals who are already giving...

522
00:57:24,976 --> 00:57:28,092
Greeks a taste of their own medicine.
This assignment is a cover.

523
00:57:28,381 --> 00:57:29,575
However it's duty.

524
00:57:30,381 --> 00:57:30,972
But...

525
00:57:32,341 --> 00:57:33,535
This mission...

526
00:57:34,581 --> 00:57:41,931
It's only a way of getting to Anatolia
easily and with authority.

527
00:57:42,621 --> 00:57:45,613
Gentlemen our country
is waiting for liberation.

528
00:57:47,501 --> 00:57:48,616
What was that?

529
00:57:49,221 --> 00:57:50,336
The noise came from upstairs.

530
00:58:03,301 --> 00:58:03,938
Where man?

531
00:58:04,501 --> 00:58:05,775
Jumped into the garden, hurry!

532
00:58:11,581 --> 00:58:12,855
My God we're done for.

533
00:58:19,381 --> 00:58:20,177
What happened here?

534
00:58:21,301 --> 00:58:23,053
He fell down and killed himself.

535
00:58:26,701 --> 00:58:27,531
This is Kara Necati.

536
00:58:30,981 --> 00:58:32,175
Bloody British informer.

537
00:58:35,781 --> 00:58:36,691
Who are you young man?

538
00:58:38,261 --> 00:58:39,694
I'm one of Osman Bey's men...

539
00:58:41,221 --> 00:58:42,574
The Patriotic movement Sir.

540
00:58:45,741 --> 00:58:46,776
Well done boy.

541
00:58:48,901 --> 00:58:50,857
Maybe you just changed
the fate of a nation!

542
00:58:53,941 --> 00:58:56,330
This country will be freed by
brave men like you.

543
00:58:59,181 --> 00:59:00,455
You will understand later.

544
00:59:02,541 --> 00:59:03,291
Thank you Pasha!

545
00:59:13,621 --> 00:59:15,896
Get rid of him. Leave no traces!

546
00:59:50,861 --> 00:59:51,771
What have you done?

547
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:53,170
The Motherfucker.

548
00:59:54,101 --> 00:59:56,586
Was apparently working
with the informer.

549
00:59:56,621 --> 00:59:59,010
I wiped him out not to expose
you, me and the others.

550
01:00:00,461 --> 01:00:01,780
But you shot him before he talked.

551
01:00:02,061 --> 01:00:07,055
Never mind. The patrol will find him
and think t'was a street fight.

552
01:00:07,581 --> 01:00:09,856
Kelle and Arab obviously cleared off.

553
01:00:10,461 --> 01:00:12,452
Let us clear off too
before we get caught.

554
01:00:14,141 --> 01:00:14,732
Come.

555
01:00:56,701 --> 01:00:58,180
Kelle Who are they?

556
01:00:58,501 --> 01:00:59,490
Don't know Osman bey.

557
01:01:09,221 --> 01:01:11,530
Union and Progress members Osman bey,
they need to get away.

558
01:01:13,661 --> 01:01:14,935
Have a nice day.

559
01:01:15,221 --> 01:01:16,017
You too.

560
01:01:19,821 --> 01:01:20,970
Welcome gentlemen.

561
01:01:22,381 --> 01:01:24,417
Your'e welcome.

562
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:29,381
I'm afraid I can't help you. I am
being watched I cannot help you run away.

563
01:01:29,416 --> 01:01:33,056
Nemrut Pasha cut off all roads,
they'll hang anyone they see.

564
01:01:34,221 --> 01:01:36,226
We will pay what you want.

565
01:01:36,261 --> 01:01:40,652
It is not about money Hodja.
I can't do miracles that's all.

566
01:01:41,061 --> 01:01:44,576
You can't leave us like this.
I have to help my family.

567
01:01:44,901 --> 01:01:46,892
You can't hand us over to them Osman bey.

568
01:01:48,301 --> 01:01:49,973
Don't you understand Hodja?
All the roads are guarded by police.

569
01:01:50,661 --> 01:01:52,014
At least take us to the other side.

570
01:01:56,661 --> 01:01:59,300
I can take you to Tuzla.
Would that help?

571
01:01:59,621 --> 01:02:05,332
Sure... Wouldn't it?
If they try to stop us later... God help us!

572
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:06,690
In that case, Come on let's go!

573
01:02:07,501 --> 01:02:08,297
Don't be mad Ali.

574
01:02:08,701 --> 01:02:11,078
I wouldn't want to oppose you, Osman Bey.

575
01:02:11,113 --> 01:02:13,456
So please let us go.
With your permission.

576
01:02:16,621 --> 01:02:17,656
As you like.

577
01:02:20,621 --> 01:02:22,657
If you get caught, don't give me away.

578
01:02:23,101 --> 01:02:25,615
We still have a lot to do here.

579
01:02:26,341 --> 01:02:27,137
May God be with you.

580
01:02:27,821 --> 01:02:28,651
You too Ali.

581
01:02:50,421 --> 01:02:52,491
Don't worry, I'll be back.

582
01:03:14,021 --> 01:03:15,010
What's going on?

583
01:03:18,821 --> 01:03:19,731
Look here Dimitri.

584
01:03:20,381 --> 01:03:23,134
We know you have weapons.
You will give us some.

585
01:03:23,621 --> 01:03:25,100
We need fifty rifles and a thousand bullets...

586
01:03:25,341 --> 01:03:26,410
Leave me alone you idiot.

587
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:29,216
What makes you so sure
that I've got weapons?

588
01:03:29,701 --> 01:03:31,453
Don't bother your heart won't stand it.

589
01:03:31,821 --> 01:03:33,015
The British officer is
always at your house.

590
01:03:34,181 --> 01:03:36,297
What are you talking about?
Your precious collection?

591
01:03:36,741 --> 01:03:37,491
Don't play with me.

592
01:03:38,061 --> 01:03:38,698
Look here.

593
01:03:39,301 --> 01:03:41,257
I sell weapons to Russians.

594
01:03:42,141 --> 01:03:43,893
I have no weapons for you.

595
01:03:44,861 --> 01:03:45,850
You will have my friend.

596
01:03:46,701 --> 01:03:47,213
You'll see.

597
01:03:47,861 --> 01:03:51,541
Just as the Armenian guerillas did,
obviously you want to have the Turks and...

598
01:03:51,576 --> 01:03:55,534
...Greeks at each others throats.
We are all Ottomans.

599
01:04:00,021 --> 01:04:01,852
Exactly what harm have they done to us?

600
01:04:02,461 --> 01:04:07,455
You're talking too much, give us weapons.
Orwe'll be back!

601
01:04:12,261 --> 01:04:13,979
Let's go...

602
01:04:16,461 --> 01:04:17,860
Sir are you ok?

603
01:04:39,541 --> 01:04:41,786
Hop hop!

604
01:04:41,821 --> 01:04:42,617
What are you doing man?

605
01:04:42,901 --> 01:04:44,380
You almost gave us a heart attack!

606
01:04:44,541 --> 01:04:46,452
I was just being cautious when
I saw you with others.

607
01:04:46,861 --> 01:04:47,771
I was watching you.

608
01:04:49,461 --> 01:04:50,894
This time it's different Jerar.

609
01:04:51,621 --> 01:04:52,849
We need to take them to Tuzla.

610
01:04:53,181 --> 01:04:53,897
What for?

611
01:04:54,301 --> 01:04:55,529
They are running away from the Brits.

612
01:05:00,421 --> 01:05:01,820
One condition for my boat...

613
01:05:01,981 --> 01:05:02,652
What's that?

614
01:05:03,341 --> 01:05:04,091
I come too.

615
01:05:04,421 --> 01:05:05,092
Jerar!

616
01:05:05,341 --> 01:05:06,456
Don't argue man.

617
01:05:06,621 --> 01:05:08,100
You never know what happens at sea.

618
01:05:08,461 --> 01:05:09,371
I can't leave you alone.

619
01:05:10,981 --> 01:05:11,777
Block head!

620
01:05:12,621 --> 01:05:13,656
I wonderwho?

621
01:05:16,941 --> 01:05:19,216
Ok then take this!

622
01:05:20,021 --> 01:05:20,737
What's this?

623
01:05:21,341 --> 01:05:22,410
This time it is not forfun man.

624
01:05:22,541 --> 01:05:23,530
We have to be cautious.

625
01:05:23,701 --> 01:05:24,372
Come on.

626
01:05:25,181 --> 01:05:28,218
Come on Gentlemen,
may God be with us.

627
01:05:47,741 --> 01:05:53,181
Enver Pasha ran to Germany but by
dealing with Lenin he will soon come back...

628
01:05:53,216 --> 01:05:56,617
...with a Caucasian army to start
the "War of Independence" in Anatolia.

629
01:05:57,301 --> 01:05:58,814
What a noble man you are.

630
01:05:59,461 --> 01:06:00,496
Why don't you come with us!

631
01:06:01,061 --> 01:06:04,178
No master. Believe me
I'm certainly not noble.

632
01:06:06,541 --> 01:06:06,546
I am not good for anything anymore.

633
01:06:06,581 --> 01:06:08,811
There isn't a front
I haven't fought on in Palestine.

634
01:06:09,461 --> 01:06:12,426
We had no food, we fried
grasshoppers, ate tree bark.

635
01:06:12,461 --> 01:06:18,172
You know Cemal Pasha's channel expedition.
I was there. We swam in a pool of blood.

636
01:06:18,981 --> 01:06:22,815
That bastard Lawrence...
I still have the scar he made.

637
01:06:23,101 --> 01:06:26,138
I mean there is no battle left
I haven't fought in.

638
01:06:27,421 --> 01:06:32,541
We couldn't beat the enemy when Germans
were with us, how do you think we will now?

639
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:38,219
Look young boy, maybe we lost one war but
this doesn't mean Turks will give up.

640
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:42,051
Nowadays we have a navy minister,
Hamidiye hero Rauf bey...

641
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:47,854
...east front commander Karabekir Pasha,
Ali Fuat and Mustafa Kemal Pasha.

642
01:07:02,701 --> 01:07:03,975
God... well gentlemen it's the end.

643
01:07:04,381 --> 01:07:06,451
From here on you're on your own.

644
01:07:07,701 --> 01:07:09,692
Come on have a safe trip.

645
01:07:10,341 --> 01:07:11,660
May God help you.

646
01:07:12,821 --> 01:07:14,539
No man I don't want money.

647
01:07:14,981 --> 01:07:16,380
Its for the country.

648
01:07:17,061 --> 01:07:19,256
May God be on your side.
Thank you.

649
01:07:19,461 --> 01:07:20,450
Thank you too.

650
01:07:22,861 --> 01:07:24,658
It's a trap! Lay down.

651
01:07:48,421 --> 01:07:49,171
Ali!

652
01:07:50,061 --> 01:07:50,857
Jerar!

653
01:07:52,741 --> 01:07:53,378
Jerar...

654
01:07:54,661 --> 01:07:55,093
Are you ok?

655
01:07:55,261 --> 01:07:57,946
I'm fine. Ahhhh... fine.

656
01:07:57,981 --> 01:08:00,814
Ok ok. Take care of the others.

657
01:08:02,021 --> 01:08:02,931
Press on, press on ok press on.

658
01:08:03,021 --> 01:08:04,010
Are you ok?

659
01:08:04,661 --> 01:08:07,812
- I'm fine, I'm fine ok.
- Come on.

660
01:08:11,221 --> 01:08:12,893
Are you ok man?

661
01:08:13,581 --> 01:08:15,412
Serving our country was not meant to be.

662
01:08:16,101 --> 01:08:17,170
This belt is full of gold.

663
01:08:18,501 --> 01:08:21,652
Please use it for the
salvation of our Khalif.

664
01:08:21,901 --> 01:08:24,813
May God bless you!

665
01:08:25,181 --> 01:08:26,409
Ok man, don't exhaust yourself.

666
01:08:30,661 --> 01:08:31,411
Let's go.

667
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:33,330
Ok, get a move on.

668
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:56,450
Hang on mate.

669
01:08:56,941 --> 01:08:58,135
I'll take you to a doctor soon.

670
01:08:59,621 --> 01:09:02,419
I'm okay, very good.

671
01:09:03,381 --> 01:09:04,575
Stinging a bit, that's all.

672
01:09:12,101 --> 01:09:15,059
Your hand. Press this press.

673
01:09:19,501 --> 01:09:20,786
Ah...

674
01:09:20,821 --> 01:09:23,779
Hang on ok.

675
01:09:30,061 --> 01:09:35,581
I'm done with this.
There is one bullet left. You might need it.

676
01:09:35,616 --> 01:09:42,054
Don't talk man, shut up,
you are bleeding badly.

677
01:09:49,461 --> 01:09:52,419
Mate...

678
01:09:53,261 --> 01:09:54,580
I am shot for the first time.

679
01:09:57,581 --> 01:09:58,536
Never mind.

680
01:09:59,581 --> 01:10:02,300
I'm proud to be dying for my country.

681
01:10:03,701 --> 01:10:07,057
Braveman my braveman, hang on, hang on.

682
01:10:09,901 --> 01:10:10,856
I can't believe this Jerar.

683
01:10:12,421 --> 01:10:13,900
It was definitely an ambush.

684
01:10:14,901 --> 01:10:16,220
I wonderwho told them.

685
01:10:16,941 --> 01:10:18,260
Osman Bey? Nadya? Who?

686
01:10:20,221 --> 01:10:26,091
We're living through a time when anyone
could be prepared to stab you in the back.

687
01:10:28,501 --> 01:10:30,969
You're right mate, you are right.

688
01:10:31,421 --> 01:10:33,173
We are close, hang on we are close.

689
01:10:39,821 --> 01:10:44,178
Jerar? Jerar! Jerar?

690
01:10:47,581 --> 01:10:48,297
My brother!

691
01:11:04,021 --> 01:11:05,056
My brother!

692
01:11:08,461 --> 01:11:09,530
My brother!

693
01:11:38,341 --> 01:11:39,774
You were a true sailor, man.

694
01:11:41,701 --> 01:11:43,453
Sleep peacefully where you belong.

695
01:12:12,941 --> 01:12:22,100
Paper... Paper, the Dardanelles hero
Mustafa Kemal Pasha has landed in Samsun.

696
01:12:43,701 --> 01:12:44,816
More power to your elbow!

697
01:12:44,851 --> 01:12:45,931
Ali, my lad! Welcome.

698
01:12:46,421 --> 01:12:50,972
Thank you man. I'm looking for Osman.
Have you seen him?

699
01:12:51,221 --> 01:12:54,657
No... He wasn't here for a long time,
no one saw or heard of him.

700
01:12:55,141 --> 01:12:56,813
Interesting.

701
01:12:58,901 --> 01:13:01,859
Have you also been hiding away?

702
01:13:02,741 --> 01:13:04,220
We get our energy that way.

703
01:13:05,021 --> 01:13:06,340
Very well.

704
01:13:07,221 --> 01:13:09,098
I'll wash my hands and
face to clear my head!

705
01:13:09,981 --> 01:13:11,300
You prepare me a nice strong raki.

706
01:13:11,421 --> 01:13:12,376
Right away!

707
01:13:18,301 --> 01:13:21,737
Hey Turk! Give us some fish, raki...

708
01:13:23,061 --> 01:13:26,770
Meze meze... haydari...
some meze as well... haydari...

709
01:13:27,661 --> 01:13:28,696
Eat shit you bastards...

710
01:13:29,101 --> 01:13:29,817
Hurry up...

711
01:13:50,501 --> 01:13:51,456
Osmanli is finished!

712
01:13:59,621 --> 01:14:02,454
No one has the strength to bring that down.

713
01:14:33,701 --> 01:14:34,929
Speak my braveman, speak...

714
01:14:35,101 --> 01:14:37,251
Please speak now.

715
01:14:37,541 --> 01:14:39,099
Where did you find this gold?

716
01:14:39,461 --> 01:14:41,341
Look how many days you've been beaten.

717
01:14:41,376 --> 01:14:42,217
Make your life easierfor.

718
01:14:43,221 --> 01:14:43,739
Miþon?

719
01:14:43,774 --> 01:14:44,258
Yes...

720
01:14:44,421 --> 01:14:47,970
Shut up... What am I to tell them.

721
01:14:48,341 --> 01:14:50,172
If I speak, they'll hang me anyway.

722
01:14:51,181 --> 01:14:52,330
They're starting again.

723
01:15:11,101 --> 01:15:12,420
Bastard.

724
01:16:00,901 --> 01:16:02,732
My God. Are you so stubborn?

725
01:16:02,981 --> 01:16:06,178
Give them a name you
fool and save yourself.

726
01:16:12,981 --> 01:16:13,538
Dimitri.

727
01:16:13,941 --> 01:16:14,817
Dimitri.

728
01:16:20,181 --> 01:16:20,897
Dimitri?

729
01:16:21,861 --> 01:16:23,419
I got the gold from Dimitri.

730
01:16:24,381 --> 01:16:25,336
A merchant in Kadiköy.

731
01:16:46,781 --> 01:16:48,261
Good choice man good choice.

732
01:16:48,296 --> 01:16:49,626
What did he say?

733
01:16:49,661 --> 01:16:52,095
Never mind. You did well.

734
01:17:37,261 --> 01:17:38,455
Shit they are coming.

735
01:17:39,381 --> 01:17:40,359
Don't look scared?

736
01:17:40,394 --> 01:17:41,337
Shut up, shut up.

737
01:17:54,781 --> 01:17:56,180
Why are they silent?

738
01:17:57,101 --> 01:17:58,773
Be careful, he knows Turkish.

739
01:18:24,261 --> 01:18:25,455
It's not the soldier's fault.

740
01:18:26,181 --> 01:18:30,220
I thought you'd heard but obviously not.

741
01:18:31,501 --> 01:18:35,050
My husband Dimitri passed
away a few days ago.

742
01:18:37,141 --> 01:18:38,017
You mean he died?

743
01:18:38,901 --> 01:18:39,572
Unfortunately...

744
01:18:41,381 --> 01:18:46,091
...the day he gave you some
work, that same day he died.

745
01:18:46,781 --> 01:18:47,736
May God have mercy on him.

746
01:18:53,381 --> 01:18:54,416
Unfortunately.

747
01:18:57,901 --> 01:19:00,256
I'm sorry.

748
01:19:00,341 --> 01:19:06,576
They brought you here by mistake but
this is important.

749
01:19:07,821 --> 01:19:09,937
Do you know this man?

750
01:19:11,701 --> 01:19:16,252
Yes! He's Ömer, he worked
for my late husband.

751
01:19:18,661 --> 01:19:21,653
Where did you find the gold?

752
01:19:22,021 --> 01:19:25,138
My husband gave the gold to him.
I was there.

753
01:19:26,181 --> 01:19:27,330
That's bad.

754
01:19:27,421 --> 01:19:29,855
Because its already been registered.

755
01:19:31,861 --> 01:19:32,418
We can't give it back.

756
01:19:33,021 --> 01:19:33,771
The gold is not important.

757
01:19:35,221 --> 01:19:43,651
Accept it as a donation If you wish I can return
the gold to you later over dinner perhaps.

758
01:19:44,221 --> 01:19:45,176
Really it's not important.

759
01:19:46,901 --> 01:19:50,780
Let us get you out of here immediately.

760
01:20:13,301 --> 01:20:16,259
Thank you.

761
01:22:00,381 --> 01:22:02,337
How could you give the gold?

762
01:22:07,141 --> 01:22:08,130
Ali, I beg you.

763
01:22:17,261 --> 01:22:23,131
I never stopped thinking about
you, every day, every hour...

764
01:22:25,581 --> 01:22:27,173
You cannot know how it feels.

765
01:22:43,501 --> 01:22:45,219
I was told you died in the war.

766
01:22:45,781 --> 01:22:47,100
I was forced to marry a Greek.

767
01:22:49,181 --> 01:22:51,137
I prayed for your soul for years.

768
01:23:02,141 --> 01:23:03,176
You are alive.

769
01:23:03,781 --> 01:23:10,016
Standing right here but
worried about a handful of gold.

770
01:25:34,821 --> 01:25:37,779
My dear one.

771
01:25:47,941 --> 01:25:53,095
Before this dream is over lets go away.

772
01:25:54,061 --> 01:26:03,906
Ok ok but... I made a promise.
That gold... was the last request...

773
01:26:03,941 --> 01:26:08,301
...of a man who died for his country. I was
going to buy weapons to send to Anatolia.

774
01:26:08,336 --> 01:26:10,461
You were going to buy weapons?

775
01:26:10,496 --> 01:26:12,426
Yes...

776
01:26:12,461 --> 01:26:16,659
Dimitri left a bargeful of weapons behind Ali!

777
01:26:17,341 --> 01:26:18,906
I don't get it.

778
01:26:18,941 --> 01:26:23,571
Dimitri was trading in illegal arms.
Actually the cellar is full of gunpowder...

779
01:26:25,181 --> 01:26:29,572
Take those guns, give them to whoever you
want. In place of gold.

780
01:26:30,501 --> 01:26:35,211
You will be keeping your promise too.
Then, I beg you, let's run away immediately.

781
01:26:36,541 --> 01:26:39,055
From now on I don't everwant anything to
remind me of my days without you.

782
01:26:44,261 --> 01:26:46,297
Ayoung Greek is here, wants to see you.

783
01:26:46,541 --> 01:26:47,371
Bring him.

784
01:27:05,101 --> 01:27:06,136
What do you want?

785
01:27:07,061 --> 01:27:10,497
I heard you were looking for someone
called Knock Out Ali.

786
01:27:12,021 --> 01:27:14,376
Yes, do you know where he is?

787
01:27:15,261 --> 01:27:21,986
This Knock Out Ali has a married lover.
I have seen him roaming around...

788
01:27:22,021 --> 01:27:24,941
...the girl's house. I have been watching
the house for some time but Ali is not around.

789
01:27:24,976 --> 01:27:30,174
However, there is a British Colonel
visiting very often. Named Scott...

790
01:27:30,981 --> 01:27:32,380
...from the Selimiye barracks.

791
01:27:32,941 --> 01:27:34,738
You may get information from him.

792
01:27:41,101 --> 01:27:44,411
Look this is enough for
us to start a new life.

793
01:27:44,501 --> 01:27:46,378
I sent Andon and Maria back home.

794
01:27:47,781 --> 01:27:49,055
Let us go somewhere else too.

795
01:27:49,301 --> 01:27:50,495
Don't worry we will go.

796
01:27:50,821 --> 01:27:52,413
Don't leave the house until I come.

797
01:27:54,381 --> 01:27:55,291
Ali...

798
01:27:57,261 --> 01:27:58,216
...be careful.

799
01:29:04,221 --> 01:29:08,897
Stop puffing up like a toad
and spit out your poison... Speak up...

800
01:29:10,501 --> 01:29:11,854
There is nothing to say Osman Bey!

801
01:29:12,181 --> 01:29:13,861
I couldn't get them to the other side.

802
01:29:13,896 --> 01:29:14,786
I'm embarassed.

803
01:29:14,821 --> 01:29:21,090
I was not surprised at all that you were
the only survivor out of the eight.

804
01:29:22,381 --> 01:29:26,659
Since you know the exact details of the trip,
You have been following events Osman Bey...

805
01:29:28,901 --> 01:29:32,655
Thank God, we have eyes and ears
everywhere. News travel fast here...

806
01:29:35,661 --> 01:29:39,973
The gold in the belt? What about it?

807
01:29:40,621 --> 01:29:43,374
Left in Mufti's belt orwhat?

808
01:29:45,581 --> 01:29:49,893
Now you are coming to me to
get information from me.

809
01:29:50,101 --> 01:29:53,298
I don't like it Ali, this is not yourway.

810
01:29:59,861 --> 01:30:00,976
Forgive me Osman Bey...

811
01:30:01,701 --> 01:30:03,612
Our country is in such a state...

812
01:30:04,341 --> 01:30:07,970
Mufti told me to buy weapons with gold.
I bought them.

813
01:30:09,501 --> 01:30:11,776
Now I have to get them to Anatolia.

814
01:30:13,141 --> 01:30:14,706
Will you help me...

815
01:30:14,741 --> 01:30:16,333
...get the weapons to Anatolia then?

816
01:30:18,301 --> 01:30:22,941
I'm surprised you are getting involved in
these affairs... Wasn't it you...

817
01:30:22,976 --> 01:30:25,409
...who said 'is it up to us to save this country?

818
01:30:26,061 --> 01:30:28,700
I must admit, the last request of old Mufti
confused me Osman Bey.

819
01:30:30,181 --> 01:30:31,375
Our country is invaded.

820
01:30:32,061 --> 01:30:34,346
Mustafa Kemal went to Anatolia...

821
01:30:34,381 --> 01:30:39,409
...with his friends as the 9th army inspector.
I cannot forget Kemal Pasha's words...

822
01:30:40,621 --> 01:30:42,339
...of that night. Obviously Pasha
is after a fight.

823
01:30:43,141 --> 01:30:49,091
Yes... Then read this.

824
01:30:56,461 --> 01:30:58,179
Mustafa Kemal issued a statement...

825
01:31:00,101 --> 01:31:05,858
"I swear on everything I consider sacred
that togetherwith our people...

826
01:31:05,981 --> 01:31:11,817
...I will strive to the end with all my
being, for the independence of our country".

827
01:31:14,461 --> 01:31:17,498
You see... I am aware
of developments too...

828
01:31:21,821 --> 01:31:22,731
...as soon as possible.
I will do what is necessary.

829
01:31:22,821 --> 01:31:24,049
Now... You get the weapons to me...

830
01:31:24,141 --> 01:31:27,770
This way you will carry out
Mufti's last request.

831
01:31:38,261 --> 01:31:40,297
Bloody whore!
Ahhhhhhhhhhh.

832
01:31:42,821 --> 01:31:44,971
Nadya!

833
01:31:47,661 --> 01:31:50,619
Ali... be careful...

834
01:32:11,061 --> 01:32:12,335
What did you do man?

835
01:32:12,581 --> 01:32:14,026
Why did you do it?

836
01:32:14,061 --> 01:32:16,826
Stop Ali...
Let's hearwhat this is all about...

837
01:32:16,861 --> 01:32:22,060
Stop stop spy... She was a spy!
She was sending wireless messages.

838
01:32:22,941 --> 01:32:24,260
I caught her in time!

839
01:32:27,181 --> 01:32:29,536
Come on guys, let's get out of here.

840
01:32:29,861 --> 01:32:32,933
We have no idea who
she was in contact with.

841
01:32:33,141 --> 01:32:34,654
I still think you shouldn't have shot her!

842
01:32:34,741 --> 01:32:37,619
Agh...

843
01:32:57,581 --> 01:33:00,618
I'll have her buried in a Christian cemetery.

844
01:34:17,021 --> 01:34:19,296
Yes yes yes Mr. Ali.

845
01:34:22,421 --> 01:34:24,935
I see you got used to guns.

846
01:34:25,981 --> 01:34:27,130
No no no!

847
01:34:30,661 --> 01:34:34,893
If you want your love alive,
you have to see me first.

848
01:34:39,101 --> 01:34:42,173
Look Guro, let's deal man to man.

849
01:34:42,901 --> 01:34:44,220
You want me.

850
01:34:45,221 --> 01:34:48,850
First untie her then we can talk.

851
01:34:49,221 --> 01:34:50,176
She is innocent.

852
01:34:51,061 --> 01:34:53,141
I killed an innocent
person because of you.

853
01:34:53,176 --> 01:34:54,369
You made me a murderer.

854
01:34:54,741 --> 01:34:56,971
I can kill another one.

855
01:38:00,661 --> 01:38:01,696
Are you ok?

856
01:38:06,181 --> 01:38:07,455
We have to leave now...

857
01:38:08,781 --> 01:38:09,736
Come here!

858
01:38:14,981 --> 01:38:15,618
Come here!

859
01:38:27,981 --> 01:38:29,175
Ali here...

860
01:38:31,421 --> 01:38:32,058
...run!

861
01:38:34,221 --> 01:38:36,257
Gunpowder. Hold this.
Run to the door.

862
01:38:55,941 --> 01:38:56,657
Run!

863
01:39:23,101 --> 01:39:23,772
Are you ok?

864
01:39:30,941 --> 01:39:31,532
Let's go...

865
01:40:25,501 --> 01:40:26,217
Defne...

866
01:40:34,741 --> 01:40:38,620
Nothing should separate us ever again...
Even death.

867
01:40:48,901 --> 01:40:54,055
My beauty, I have to deliver those weapons.
You know that.

868
01:40:56,021 --> 01:40:56,737
Look at me!

869
01:40:59,021 --> 01:41:01,535
After the delivery... I promise you...

870
01:41:02,341 --> 01:41:04,980
We will go somewhere,
I say I promise you!

871
01:41:18,141 --> 01:41:19,574
Come on, they are waiting for us.

872
01:41:22,181 --> 01:41:24,615
You will take the boat to Kurna bay
with Andon!

873
01:42:40,301 --> 01:42:41,177
How come your alive again?

874
01:42:41,541 --> 01:42:43,816
You were shot too but you're still alive,
why shouldn't I be?

875
01:42:44,181 --> 01:42:45,091
You scoundrel!

876
01:42:46,981 --> 01:42:48,892
Speak up, tell me who
brought you back to life?

877
01:42:48,981 --> 01:42:50,050
Your mother!

878
01:42:52,181 --> 01:42:56,857
If you don't want to die,
speak up or I'll shoot!

879
01:43:05,501 --> 01:43:07,571
You asked for this, you bloody fool...

880
01:43:20,621 --> 01:43:22,577
Where the hell have you been Ali!

881
01:43:25,101 --> 01:43:26,659
I was beginning to worry.

882
01:43:30,621 --> 01:43:31,770
Thank you, Kelle.

883
01:43:34,741 --> 01:43:35,810
I put the weapons in a safe place.

884
01:43:37,301 --> 01:43:38,859
Somewhere along Kurnaköy bay.

885
01:43:40,021 --> 01:43:45,732
Good, I'll give you two men so you
can go and deliver the weapons.

886
01:43:46,101 --> 01:43:48,410
That's not the way it's going to be
Osman Bey. Only you and I will go...

887
01:43:48,541 --> 01:43:49,974
...no one else will come with us.

888
01:43:51,021 --> 01:43:51,817
Why's that?

889
01:43:52,701 --> 01:43:53,895
I'll tell you the reason on the way.

890
01:43:55,181 --> 01:43:56,296
Okay then, have it yourway...

891
01:43:58,061 --> 01:44:02,020
Usually I have my men follow me
like a shadow but...

892
01:44:04,421 --> 01:44:10,417
...this time, if you insist, it'll be only
me and my revolver...

893
01:44:11,541 --> 01:44:15,739
Kelle... I have something to do...

894
01:44:17,341 --> 01:44:18,410
You take care of the place...

895
01:44:19,381 --> 01:44:20,370
Ok, Osman Bey!

896
01:44:25,781 --> 01:44:28,693
You certainly like taking precautions.
I like it...

897
01:44:29,981 --> 01:44:32,221
If you only had a little
more patriotism in you...

898
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:33,540
...we could have done a lot together.

899
01:44:34,021 --> 01:44:35,898
There are weaknesses in your
organization Osman Bey!

900
01:44:36,821 --> 01:44:37,776
What are you getting at?

901
01:44:37,861 --> 01:44:39,579
In my opinion Nadya wasn't the traitor!

902
01:44:40,581 --> 01:44:42,139
Don't beat about the bush lad,
tell me what's on your mind...

903
01:44:42,581 --> 01:44:46,699
Do you remember that night when you shot
and killed þskelet Musa near...

904
01:44:48,421 --> 01:44:52,066
...Mustafa Kemal Pasha's chalet?
Well I saw him at a market place...

905
01:44:52,101 --> 01:44:57,494
I killed him a little while ago. In otherwords,
he didn't die that night when you shot him.

906
01:45:00,301 --> 01:45:02,861
Bugger me! You saw him fall to the ground
like a bag of shit didn't you?

907
01:45:04,741 --> 01:45:06,174
Let's suppose we were wrong to
think he was dead then.

908
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:10,179
What would you say to the fact that
he drew his gun as soon as he saw me?

909
01:45:14,101 --> 01:45:15,659
I really think someone is playing
games with you Osman Bey.

910
01:45:20,141 --> 01:45:21,620
Please don't tell me that Nadya did this too...

911
01:45:23,781 --> 01:45:26,215
Çopur Talat or Çengel could have done it...

912
01:45:27,581 --> 01:45:29,572
Now can you understand why
I wanted you to work with me?!

913
01:45:30,701 --> 01:45:32,657
It's very hard to find trustworthy
men these days.

914
01:45:50,181 --> 01:45:51,091
The boat's there...

915
01:46:47,901 --> 01:46:49,857
Osman, help me!
Osman bey, help me!

916
01:46:51,421 --> 01:46:52,536
It's the end Ali...

917
01:46:52,861 --> 01:46:53,737
Osman bey ha?

918
01:46:54,301 --> 01:46:55,097
Hands up!

919
01:47:01,261 --> 01:47:02,489
Vay Cukurcesmeli vay!

920
01:47:08,541 --> 01:47:12,056
Osman Bey there are no weapons on
this boat. He's tricked us again.

921
01:47:12,341 --> 01:47:14,457
Our British friends will be very annoyed!

922
01:47:34,021 --> 01:47:34,976
Hosst!

923
01:48:05,821 --> 01:48:10,292
Speak up Osman Bey, speak up...
Why are you doing this?

924
01:48:11,501 --> 01:48:15,546
Ali... I know you don't owe me anything
but please do me one last favour.

925
01:48:15,581 --> 01:48:22,259
In the name of God... You shot me Ali!
Let everyone think the British shot me.

926
01:48:26,101 --> 01:48:30,094
Nobody knows I'm a traitor.

927
01:48:31,701 --> 01:48:32,850
But I don't understand?

928
01:48:33,821 --> 01:48:34,936
Ahh...

929
01:48:36,381 --> 01:48:37,177
Why did you do this?

930
01:48:37,861 --> 01:48:39,613
The British blackmailed me.

931
01:48:42,781 --> 01:48:45,454
They found out I was a member
of the police organization.

932
01:48:46,821 --> 01:48:52,578
They have taken my sick daughter
and wife hostage in Italy.

933
01:48:56,061 --> 01:48:57,653
They didn't leave me any other option.

934
01:49:00,021 --> 01:49:02,137
I was forced to help them.

935
01:49:04,781 --> 01:49:12,938
I'm sorry Ali, I blamed so many people.
Shoot me and finish me off.

936
01:49:14,341 --> 01:49:15,694
Was Nadya part of your cover?

937
01:49:15,901 --> 01:49:18,210
She realised what was going on.
She was going to talk!

938
01:49:21,181 --> 01:49:25,732
Come on, please shoot me Ali,
the British will be here soon...

939
01:49:27,941 --> 01:49:32,731
Alright, I'll help you but first, tell me who
I should deliver these weapons to.

940
01:49:34,061 --> 01:49:35,016
Go to Sile immediately... There's a midwife
at the healty center, called Müzeyyen.

941
01:49:44,661 --> 01:49:45,980
She is a real patriot.

942
01:49:48,941 --> 01:49:51,091
Give the weapons to her.

943
01:49:54,021 --> 01:49:56,740
Go Ali, don't waste any more time!

944
01:50:01,421 --> 01:50:04,811
Ok. Take this then and
do what you have to do!

945
01:50:07,901 --> 01:50:09,050
There is only one bullet in it anyway.

946
01:50:28,141 --> 01:50:28,971
Ali!

947
01:51:00,581 --> 01:51:01,570
Shit, damned bastards.

948
01:51:44,461 --> 01:51:45,735
Run away Ali, run away.

949
01:52:35,341 --> 01:52:37,536
Very good, give me a kiss.

950
01:52:37,981 --> 01:52:39,066
May God bless you.

951
01:52:39,101 --> 01:52:41,331
Control the fever every 2 hours.

952
01:52:44,741 --> 01:52:45,730
Welcome...

953
01:52:45,861 --> 01:52:46,577
Good to meet you.

954
01:52:46,861 --> 01:52:47,771
What can I do for you?

955
01:52:48,661 --> 01:52:49,141
Midwife Müzeyyen, yes?

956
01:52:49,176 --> 01:52:49,778
Yes!

957
01:52:50,101 --> 01:52:57,018
Well we... we won't take up
too much of your time.

958
01:52:58,501 --> 01:52:59,456
Come in please.

959
01:53:07,341 --> 01:53:11,741
We have a bargeful of weapons.
We want to send them to Anatolia.

960
01:53:11,776 --> 01:53:12,856
Who told you to come to me?

961
01:53:14,021 --> 01:53:21,101
Cukurcesmeli sacrificed his life
today trying to protect the weapons.

962
01:53:21,136 --> 01:53:22,978
Unfortunately we lost him during
a fight with the British!

963
01:53:25,581 --> 01:53:26,616
Where are the weapons now?

964
01:53:28,501 --> 01:53:29,536
On a boat anchored close to the shore.

965
01:53:30,261 --> 01:53:31,819
But how much do you want
for these weapons?

966
01:53:36,581 --> 01:53:37,570
Nothing!

967
01:53:39,581 --> 01:53:42,220
Good! Let's get to work, we must unload
the weapons right away...

968
01:53:45,541 --> 01:53:49,011
But wait a moment... I'd like to know exactly
where these weapons are going?

969
01:53:49,341 --> 01:53:51,093
To Mustafa Kemal Pasha, Ali Bey...

970
01:53:52,221 --> 01:53:52,971
You know me?

971
01:53:55,741 --> 01:53:56,412
My lieutenant!

972
01:54:17,421 --> 01:54:18,649
Welcome to our group!

973
01:54:59,261 --> 01:55:02,219
That's that then... We can be on
ourway too can't we?

974
01:55:06,141 --> 01:55:07,130
What's wrong?

975
01:55:14,221 --> 01:55:15,893
I don't know how to say this to you...

976
01:55:20,501 --> 01:55:21,411
I've been thinking while watching...

977
01:55:21,541 --> 01:55:25,614
...these mothers, grandparents carring
hundreds of kilos on their backs...

978
01:55:28,021 --> 01:55:28,976
Look at Lieutenant Recep...

979
01:55:29,501 --> 01:55:30,820
He's already lost a leg to the war and yet
he's still struggling for...

980
01:55:30,941 --> 01:55:32,090
...the freedom of his country.

981
01:55:39,821 --> 01:55:42,016
...lt makes me feel there is something
more important than just us, Defne...

982
01:55:43,501 --> 01:55:44,536
Surely our country...

983
01:55:46,021 --> 01:55:46,976
What are you saying Ali!

984
01:55:50,181 --> 01:55:56,177
Defne... I can't be that selfish and
go off to Vienna now. Now I understand.

985
01:55:56,661 --> 01:55:58,731
This country will be freed by
brave men like you.

986
01:55:59,901 --> 01:56:01,698
This Country needs one of us.

987
01:56:03,021 --> 01:56:04,340
I have to join the war
efforts in anatolia.

988
01:56:05,501 --> 01:56:06,377
Ali!

989
01:56:09,781 --> 01:56:11,499
Please forgive me Defne!

990
01:56:13,021 --> 01:56:16,411
I love you and always will.

991
01:56:17,821 --> 01:56:18,617
So will I!

992
01:57:00,821 --> 01:57:01,697
Give that to me. Take this.

993
01:57:12,981 --> 01:57:15,051
Come on. Come on.

994
01:58:06,621 --> 01:58:07,337
Ali.
