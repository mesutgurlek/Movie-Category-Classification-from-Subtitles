1
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,891
Once upon a time there was a Shtetl,
a small Jewish village in Eastern Europe.

2
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:41,838
It was in the year 5701.
1941 according to the new calendar.

3
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:46,655
It was summer. Summer of 1941.

4
00:00:47,099 --> 00:00:48,976
July, I think.

5
00:00:49,419 --> 00:00:53,207
I thought I could escape
everything I had seen.

6
00:00:54,259 --> 00:00:55,897
I ran to warn them.

7
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:59,490
My own people, my Shtetl, my village.

8
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:04,131
This is the story of my village…

9
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,493
Rabbi!

10
00:01:28,018 --> 00:01:29,451
What?

11
00:01:31,698 --> 00:01:33,256
What's up?

12
00:02:13,536 --> 00:02:14,951
Tell them.

13
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:22,572
He has given them the go ahead.

14
00:02:23,896 --> 00:02:26,251
God has simply given them the go ahead.

15
00:02:27,216 --> 00:02:30,571
"Look", he told me,

16
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:35,171
"you are already insane anyway."

17
00:02:35,615 --> 00:02:37,571
How can one wash away the dirt

18
00:02:38,415 --> 00:02:40,610
from eyes that have seen too much?

19
00:02:42,415 --> 00:02:45,373
The birds, who were singing,

20
00:02:46,655 --> 00:02:50,568
suddenly went quiet and disappeared.

21
00:02:51,015 --> 00:02:54,211
- They didn't want to come with us.
- What are you talking about?

22
00:02:54,654 --> 00:02:57,452
Tell them, Schlomo... the Nazis...

23
00:02:57,894 --> 00:02:59,646
I am telling.

24
00:03:00,094 --> 00:03:02,767
I am telling you: The Nazis.

25
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:07,685
We traveled through space one day,
beyond the sky.

26
00:03:08,134 --> 00:03:12,252
Now I know...
There is no more space in our hearts.

27
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:15,110
- We're looking for it elsewhere.
- Stop rambling.

28
00:03:15,354 --> 00:03:17,151
Tell us now.

29
00:03:17,494 --> 00:03:18,847
I'll translate.

30
00:03:19,893 --> 00:03:21,924
The Nazis have arrived.

31
00:03:22,653 --> 00:03:24,609
Not in our Shtetl. Not yet.

32
00:03:25,053 --> 00:03:27,726
In the Shtetl on the other
side of the mountain.

33
00:03:28,173 --> 00:03:30,482
Schlomo brings terrible news:

34
00:03:30,933 --> 00:03:35,802
The Nazis are killing all Jews or
deporting them to unknown destinations.

35
00:03:36,893 --> 00:03:40,010
Everybody! Men, women, children, old.
Whole villages!

36
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,092
So the rumor is correct.
Nobody ever returns,

37
00:03:43,533 --> 00:03:46,000
or ever wrote a letter.

38
00:03:46,452 --> 00:03:48,886
What should we do? I ask you.

39
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,843
The same will happen to us soon.

40
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,767
Still one can't make whole
villages disappear!

41
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:57,850
That's really insane.

42
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:02,001
He's insane and telling lies.
We'll do nothing.

43
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:05,410
But what if he's telling the truth?

44
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:10,447
Could you sleep well at night then?

45
00:04:11,251 --> 00:04:15,290
What would you tell your wives,
children, grandchildren?

46
00:04:16,331 --> 00:04:19,209
We knew about it,
but didn't believe it...

47
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:22,485
We must come up with a solution.
Now, tonight!

48
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:25,122
How can we save our community?

49
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:31,564
Don't know...

50
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:35,335
An idea...

51
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:36,969
Quiet!

52
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:40,959
- We're thinking! - If you wake up
the children, I'll throw you out!

53
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:46,808
- How could we think without talking?
- Try!

54
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,825
- I got it. I have an idea.
- Don't crack now.

55
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,165
- We buy weapons and defend ourselves!
- Killing?

56
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,886
No, we'll only scare them.
Who's talking about killing?

57
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,524
Stupid idea!

58
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,201
Only because I didn't want my
Esther to marry your grandson!

59
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:05,437
Keep her, your beautiful Esther!
Put her in a frame!

60
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:08,642
- That's sinful talk!
- Stop it!

61
00:05:11,889 --> 00:05:14,657
- A false deportation train.
- Who's talking?

62
00:05:14,909 --> 00:05:17,960
The eternal one.
Well, the madman...

63
00:05:19,609 --> 00:05:20,962
Repeat it, Schlomo.

64
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:23,567
- A false deportation train.
- What?

65
00:05:24,009 --> 00:05:26,204
A false deportation train.
Can't you hear me?

66
00:05:26,649 --> 00:05:29,037
Organizing a deportation train?

67
00:05:31,448 --> 00:05:35,407
We'll deport goats, cows, geese

68
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:40,201
to the Holy Land, to Erez Israel.
And the children too...

69
00:05:40,448 --> 00:05:44,282
- What about us? Why just the children?
- Yes, us, the children.

70
00:05:45,768 --> 00:05:49,317
We should be the deported and
the Germans at the same time.

71
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:54,883
Shtetl, Ukraine, Russia, Palestine...

72
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:58,842
Home... Free as a bird.

73
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:02,340
Oh God! This is really meshuggah!

74
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:06,805
We'll do their work if we
deport ourselves. That's insane.

75
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:11,802
- If they want to deport us, they should at
least work hard for it! - A brilliant idea!

76
00:06:12,967 --> 00:06:16,982
- You'll be rich. What's your name?
- Rothschild. - Remember that name!

77
00:06:17,027 --> 00:06:20,138
- My wife can't stand going by train.
- How d'you know? She never took the train.

78
00:06:20,286 --> 00:06:22,959
She never took the train because
she can't stand it! Can't you hear me?

79
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:27,638
Dressing up like Germans, like Nazis!
A dishonor! A sin!

80
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:32,398
- God will never forgive us!
- One more word and I'll kick you out!

81
00:06:33,206 --> 00:06:36,437
A train?
Think about it. A train!

82
00:06:36,886 --> 00:06:40,561
And what else?
Why not a boat, while we're at it.

83
00:06:41,006 --> 00:06:45,283
Of course! He's right. A train!

84
00:06:45,725 --> 00:06:47,602
A train! A train!

85
00:06:50,045 --> 00:06:53,117
- How should we find a train?
- Buy one.

86
00:06:53,565 --> 00:06:55,123
Coach by coach.

87
00:06:55,565 --> 00:06:58,557
- How do we get the money?
- From the community, and from donations.

88
00:06:59,005 --> 00:07:02,839
- How much? - And the uniforms?
- Jews are the best tailors.

89
00:07:03,285 --> 00:07:06,163
- We'll make them ourselves!
- The weapons, the fake papers?

90
00:07:06,605 --> 00:07:08,118
Weapons... why weapons?

91
00:07:08,565 --> 00:07:12,637
The fake papers...
are simply made from real paper!

92
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:15,359
We'll have to speak German without accent.

93
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:20,282
Prepare departure. Deportation of the
whole village without anyone noticing.

94
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:22,555
Yes, that's what we'll do.

95
00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:24,403
We'll fly away!

96
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:28,120
Heaven and earth will reunify,
the birds will return…

97
00:07:28,564 --> 00:07:33,116
God, why do men rule the world?
Why does a madman show the way?

98
00:07:33,264 --> 00:07:37,122
Jehuda, have you heard it?
- Even a deaf person has heard it!

99
00:07:37,563 --> 00:07:40,680
- We'll go by train to Palestine.
- Don't you worry? - No, why?

100
00:07:41,123 --> 00:07:43,796
Nobody talks about the costs!

101
00:07:44,243 --> 00:07:47,921
- To Palestine! By boat!
- No, by train!

102
00:07:47,963 --> 00:07:51,033
Thanks for telling me.
I already bought swimming tires.

103
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:53,997
Listening to a madman!
That's meshuggah!

104
00:07:54,443 --> 00:07:58,197
- Who'll look after our houses?
- My son is to be married in a month!

105
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:02,794
Schlomo, I've made a list of
all things I want to bring...

106
00:08:03,242 --> 00:08:06,757
I'll just bring my list,
that's all I have.

107
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:09,299
- What are you doing?
- These Germans!

108
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:12,991
They shouldn't be sitting here watching
the beautiful Esther pass by!

109
00:08:13,442 --> 00:08:16,275
- But Esther won't be around then.
- So won't the bench!

110
00:08:16,722 --> 00:08:20,840
It's not so easy to buy a train!
And where should I hide it?

111
00:08:21,282 --> 00:08:25,321
- Should we bring our furniture?
- I don't know. Ask the rabbi.

112
00:08:25,762 --> 00:08:28,719
Will we ever return?

113
00:08:37,721 --> 00:08:40,599
- I have a delivery later this month.
- Quiet!

114
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,430
Quiet! I can't hear a word!

115
00:08:43,881 --> 00:08:45,678
Ask your questions, one at a time.

116
00:08:46,121 --> 00:08:49,318
But not only to me, ask Schlomo too.

117
00:08:50,241 --> 00:08:54,358
The madman!?
- Deport ourselves is insane anyway.

118
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,519
I'll make five officer uniforms
and thirty soldier uniforms.

119
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,396
Itzik makes the boots.
Herschele makes the helmets.

120
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:06,876
But in what sizes?

121
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,279
Who'll be wearing it?
Which of us will be Germans?

122
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,438
The Nazis.

123
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,713
- I've forgotten to buy flour...
- Nobody leaves the room!

124
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:23,837
Who wants to be Nazi?
I mean German.

125
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:33,957
- Itzik?
- No. God help us! Nazism is a sin!

126
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:37,152
Misfortune would strike my family.

127
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:39,237
No, thanks.

128
00:09:43,718 --> 00:09:47,233
- Jankele? - I'm an accountant
and suffer from stomach ulcer.

129
00:09:47,678 --> 00:09:50,476
- A real German don't do that.
- Nobody then?

130
00:09:50,918 --> 00:09:55,946
- So we put real Nazis in place.
- They can deport us in a correct manner.

131
00:09:56,718 --> 00:10:00,347
- How about you, Mordechai?
- I'm sorry, Rabbi, I can't do that.

132
00:10:00,798 --> 00:10:03,756
Be aware of the responsibility this means.

133
00:10:04,198 --> 00:10:07,076
Quarrel with Germans in German...
that's not for me.

134
00:10:07,518 --> 00:10:11,173
The council of wise men should decide
who should be the Germans.

135
00:10:11,317 --> 00:10:15,230
Very good! Excellent!
Everybody stays here.

136
00:10:20,437 --> 00:10:21,790
Was I right to refuse?

137
00:10:22,237 --> 00:10:25,593
- Why hasn't he asked you?
- Me, a Nazi? No!

138
00:10:27,157 --> 00:10:29,113
God, please. Not me.

139
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,606
To the benefit of the community,
the council have chosen those

140
00:10:47,756 --> 00:10:50,729
who can speak German fluently,
with a minimum of accent,

141
00:10:50,876 --> 00:10:54,386
who are familiar with the Germanic
culture, and who in the past

142
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:58,033
have shown superior self-control.

143
00:10:58,996 --> 00:11:02,351
The decision is final and irrevocable!

144
00:11:02,795 --> 00:11:06,993
The mission is to bring the community
safely to the destination.

145
00:11:07,435 --> 00:11:11,269
To the Holy Land,
to Palestine, to Erez Israel,

146
00:11:11,715 --> 00:11:13,910
like Moses,
who led us out of Egypt.

147
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:18,314
You are responsible to God
to fulfill this mission.

148
00:11:19,155 --> 00:11:23,734
For his merits, the Council wants to
appoint the wood merchant

149
00:11:24,155 --> 00:11:27,430
Mordechai Schwartz
to be commander of the train.

150
00:11:27,874 --> 00:11:30,308
He'll take upon a great responsibility.

151
00:11:30,754 --> 00:11:33,826
The other Germans are:
Samuel Heimovici,

152
00:11:34,274 --> 00:11:36,742
Ezra Finkelstein, Ezra Harari...

153
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:14,983
Quickly!

154
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,503
Put it over there.

155
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:27,287
Bread: 17.
- 17?

156
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:36,820
Golda, I have told you, no pastries.
That's not proper food.

157
00:13:37,269 --> 00:13:40,306
- It's for the kids!
- No, we don't have enough room.

158
00:13:40,749 --> 00:13:43,138
And besides, pastries are for Purim!

159
00:13:43,589 --> 00:13:46,387
- Maybe we haven't arrived by then.
- They'll be eaten before that.

160
00:13:46,829 --> 00:13:49,582
How could a child tell when it's Purim.

161
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,738
It sees the pastry, eats it
and says "It's Purim!"

162
00:13:54,189 --> 00:13:56,339
One can't discuss such matters with you...

163
00:13:56,789 --> 00:13:58,461
And what's that?

164
00:13:59,988 --> 00:14:01,546
Gherkin, Russian style...

165
00:14:01,988 --> 00:14:04,104
That makes 1500 potato knishes,

166
00:14:04,948 --> 00:14:07,906
cabbage, carrots, 4200 dumplings,

167
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:10,782
latkes, klopslach, beef tongues.

168
00:14:11,628 --> 00:14:16,019
Malka, you and Lea should make the bread.
Have we forgotten anything?

169
00:14:16,468 --> 00:14:18,220
Do you remember Ari...

170
00:14:18,668 --> 00:14:20,624
You are beautiful, my girl.

171
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:25,775
- Happy man who will marry you!
- Rich and handsome.

172
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:30,056
I'm sure.

173
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,062
Esther!

174
00:14:35,747 --> 00:14:39,786
Marry me, please, before we leave!

175
00:14:40,227 --> 00:14:43,458
No, Jossi.
You're old, ugly and weak.

176
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:47,695
You still live with your mom. You are the
helper of the rabbi. I'll never marry you.

177
00:14:50,707 --> 00:14:54,016
I'll marry a real man!

178
00:14:54,986 --> 00:14:56,783
I will completely belong to him.

179
00:14:57,226 --> 00:14:58,579
With body and…

180
00:15:07,346 --> 00:15:09,621
Don't push! Discipline!

181
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:12,216
Line up to make donations!

182
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:19,821
Please stay in line.

183
00:15:22,185 --> 00:15:24,540
- Hurry up, Mendel.
- I'm coming, Jankele.

184
00:15:24,985 --> 00:15:29,740
A wooden chess game
from Mrs. Grossmann. Here.

185
00:15:30,905 --> 00:15:33,499
A wooden chess game.
Make note.

186
00:15:33,945 --> 00:15:36,334
A wooden chess game
from Mrs. Grossmann.

187
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:40,778
Schlomo: An apple. Make note.
Next. You can leave, Schlomo.

188
00:15:41,225 --> 00:15:42,703
- Thanks.
- Next.

189
00:15:43,144 --> 00:15:44,497
Schlomo: An apple.

190
00:15:47,504 --> 00:15:48,459
Thanks.

191
00:15:48,904 --> 00:15:51,054
Let's see... Yes, that's correct.

192
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:55,182
Thanks. Have a nice Sunday.

193
00:15:56,584 --> 00:15:59,337
Hurry up! We have to be home before dark.

194
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:02,776
It's massive silver, for sure.

195
00:16:03,624 --> 00:16:05,296
That should be enough.

196
00:16:08,303 --> 00:16:10,339
"Dear Israel Schmecht,

197
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:14,298
dear cousin!"

198
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:18,533
Israel Schmecht, my wife's cousin.

199
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:21,417
A Yiddish writer
of worldwide reputation.

200
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:26,015
Israel will join us
and take part of our adventure.

201
00:16:26,823 --> 00:16:31,339
He lives in Switzerland,
after fleeing from his homeland Austria,

202
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:33,773
which was attacked by Hitler, the barbarian.

203
00:16:34,542 --> 00:16:39,099
He will give us some important help,
teach us to speak fluent German,

204
00:16:39,342 --> 00:16:42,459
without any trace of Yiddish accent,

205
00:16:42,902 --> 00:16:46,178
as well as the culture,
civilization and psychology

206
00:16:46,622 --> 00:16:51,034
of the people of Goethe,
both bourgeoisie and simple soldiers.

207
00:16:56,822 --> 00:16:59,210
I don't get it! It's too difficult.

208
00:16:59,661 --> 00:17:03,336
It's very much like Yiddish.
I do understand it.

209
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:08,013
German is a rigid language.
It is precise and sad.

210
00:17:08,741 --> 00:17:13,132
Yiddish is a parody of German.
It adds humor.

211
00:17:13,581 --> 00:17:18,052
To speak perfect German and
to get rid of the Yiddish accent,

212
00:17:18,501 --> 00:17:20,492
just leave out the humor.

213
00:17:20,941 --> 00:17:24,899
Do they know that they are subject
to parody? Maybe that's why they make war.

214
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:26,409
No!

215
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,773
I agree. It would be cheaper
to pay for the train all at once.

216
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:35,213
To buy one coach at a time is
more expensive, but it is safer!

217
00:17:35,660 --> 00:17:39,619
This is killing me, Mendel!
I can't go on like this.

218
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,937
It can't be done against your will!

219
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:45,133
Don't get so upset!
I can't do anything.

220
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,619
- We wont get it for under 10000.
- 10000 for one coach? No!

221
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:51,617
He's crazy. It's not my money!

222
00:17:52,059 --> 00:17:56,894
With leather. Delivery just before our
departure. We wont get it any cheaper!

223
00:17:57,339 --> 00:18:01,252
I don't need any leather. Mordechai
shouldn't bother us with his leather goods.

224
00:18:01,699 --> 00:18:06,329
- 5000, my last offer!
- Mordechai can't do anything anyway.

225
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:09,930
All coaches for German officers
are furnished with leather.

226
00:18:10,379 --> 00:18:13,849
- When real Germans enter the train...
- Your Germans make me want to throw up!

227
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:18,373
I hate them,
before I've even seen one!

228
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:29,416
Is this what I get in return for
everything that I've taught you?

229
00:18:31,258 --> 00:18:32,213
Jankele...

230
00:18:32,658 --> 00:18:35,536
Are you okay? Your medicine...

231
00:18:35,978 --> 00:18:38,811
Never again require such sums from me.
That would be the best medicine.

232
00:18:45,217 --> 00:18:46,855
That is beautiful!

233
00:18:48,417 --> 00:18:51,170
- Not so expensive!
- A train...

234
00:19:17,976 --> 00:19:19,534
Yes, very good...

235
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:28,884
Did you hide the money well?

236
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:33,533
Listen, your cousin is a communist.
He sees the Messiah everywhere.

237
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:38,651
Don't spend too much time with him.
It could infect you.

238
00:19:39,095 --> 00:19:42,167
"Women and men of the world, unite!"

239
00:19:42,615 --> 00:19:46,130
Think about it. "Unite!"
He has only got one thing on his mind.

240
00:19:46,575 --> 00:19:51,444
You'll give him the money, and he makes
the ID documents and passes.

241
00:19:51,895 --> 00:19:54,329
Rabbi, you have already told me all that.

242
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:56,970
- It's better once too often.
- But twenty...

243
00:19:57,415 --> 00:19:59,566
- You should hide them...
- In my shirt, yes.

244
00:19:59,614 --> 00:20:02,089
I sleep in a public place
and eat only kosher.

245
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,768
The next morning I'll take the train...

246
00:20:05,214 --> 00:20:08,968
You already know! Why did you let
me repeat it twenty times?

247
00:20:09,414 --> 00:20:13,089
- To be sure nothing was forgotten.
- Very well, my son.

248
00:20:18,374 --> 00:20:20,763
- Here are some cookies for the journey.
- Thanks, Mama.

249
00:20:21,214 --> 00:20:22,567
Goodbye.

250
00:20:25,653 --> 00:20:27,928
He'll be back in four days time.

251
00:20:29,253 --> 00:20:30,606
Do you want some cookies?

252
00:21:35,371 --> 00:21:38,044
- Jossele, is that you?
- Yes, Mama.

253
00:21:38,491 --> 00:21:42,968
Haven't you told your cousin Abi,
that we are going to Palestine?

254
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:46,407
- I have, but he wont come with us.
- Why not?

255
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:50,006
Mama, listen.

256
00:21:51,130 --> 00:21:55,248
Soon all people will be alike. Abi says
that we don't have to flee anymore.

257
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:59,763
Since the world soon will be one
country only, fleeing is about not moving.

258
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:04,965
Free! We don't get anything here.
We only live isolated, in seclusion.

259
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:07,964
You are going to leave me alone.

260
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:11,640
No, Mama, that's not true.
Listen to me!

261
00:22:12,089 --> 00:22:14,808
Unbelievable, that we didn't know.

262
00:22:15,249 --> 00:22:18,161
Everything will be different in the future.

263
00:22:18,609 --> 00:22:20,804
Do you know what he said?

264
00:22:21,249 --> 00:22:23,285
"Proletarians of all countries,

265
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:26,925
unite!"

266
00:22:29,629 --> 00:22:32,645
Unite! Isn't that lovely?

267
00:22:34,108 --> 00:22:36,702
- The Messiah is here.
- Have you seen him?

268
00:22:37,048 --> 00:22:40,199
- Of course. As I you see now.
- What's he like?

269
00:22:40,648 --> 00:22:44,197
He leads the revolution. Day and night.
He changes people's minds.

270
00:22:44,648 --> 00:22:47,481
- He creates the new man.
- What does he do with the old?

271
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:52,567
- Can one be overage and still new?
- We are Jews, not proletarians.

272
00:22:52,768 --> 00:22:56,959
He's called the Messiah,
but no one knows who he is.

273
00:22:57,408 --> 00:23:00,319
It is a code name, so that he
wont be recognized and arrested.

274
00:23:00,767 --> 00:23:05,716
Same thing with "proletarians",
it's a code name for revolutionaries.

275
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:10,568
One acts in secret, defies the danger...

276
00:23:10,687 --> 00:23:14,844
incognito, clandestine, revolutionary...

277
00:23:15,775 --> 00:23:18,675
The utopist, the adventurer!

278
00:23:19,647 --> 00:23:20,657
Enough now!

279
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,708
I'll give you danger.

280
00:23:23,826 --> 00:23:28,402
Is that why you've shaven off you beard?
So that no one will recognize you?

281
00:23:29,206 --> 00:23:31,615
You punk! I feel sorry for your mother.

282
00:23:32,526 --> 00:23:33,754
Proletarian…

283
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:37,994
What are you looking at?
Go away! Go home!

284
00:23:39,646 --> 00:23:40,601
Bravo!

285
00:23:43,766 --> 00:23:46,963
- Why a blue coach?
- No more paint.

286
00:23:55,405 --> 00:23:58,761
Careful! You're breaking it.
Rabbi...

287
00:24:02,365 --> 00:24:05,802
I'm the train manager,
but I can't run the locomotive.

288
00:24:06,045 --> 00:24:11,336
We need a Jewish train driver, a railway
map and a second-hand locomotive.

289
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:14,264
- Where from?
- Let me finish.

290
00:24:14,525 --> 00:24:17,800
Go to Anton Levi,
one of Rachel's relatives...

291
00:24:18,244 --> 00:24:21,077
The old woman?
Nobody wants to be a relative of hers.

292
00:24:21,524 --> 00:24:24,322
- How do you know, you don't know her.
- Why do you give me her orders?

293
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:26,800
- Nobody said that!
- You did!

294
00:24:27,244 --> 00:24:29,712
Did I said that?

295
00:24:30,164 --> 00:24:34,396
You see! You are not taking orders
from her, nor anyone else.

296
00:24:35,044 --> 00:24:37,000
Find this horse-man Anton Levi!

297
00:24:37,444 --> 00:24:39,958
- What has a horse-man got to do with trains?
- He works in transportation!

298
00:24:40,403 --> 00:24:44,760
It's the same! He surely knows
someone at the Railroad Ministry.

299
00:24:46,483 --> 00:24:49,680
Money for the trip.
And don't come back a communist!

300
00:24:50,123 --> 00:24:52,398
Rabbi, Itzik is back!

301
00:24:56,123 --> 00:24:59,877
Quickly, tell the council and Mordechai!

302
00:25:00,763 --> 00:25:03,721
Jankele and all you others, quickly!

303
00:25:16,842 --> 00:25:20,039
This is Schtrull Geitzl, the train driver.

304
00:25:20,882 --> 00:25:23,838
- Welcome!
- Aleichem shalom.

305
00:25:24,162 --> 00:25:25,834
So you are a train driver?

306
00:25:27,362 --> 00:25:30,911
Schtrull has never yet driven a locomotive.

307
00:25:31,362 --> 00:25:35,110
Wait! He's a high officer
at the Railroad Ministry.

308
00:25:35,361 --> 00:25:39,110
He's the manager of the archives...
and has brought... give it to me...

309
00:25:39,361 --> 00:25:42,990
A manual:
"How to drive a locomotive"

310
00:25:45,441 --> 00:25:49,150
- I always wanted to be a train driver.
- He's been restrained in an office...

311
00:25:49,961 --> 00:25:54,113
- Try it. - They were afraid a Jew
like him would steal a locomotive.

312
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:58,189
So he is an honest man
and a talented train driver.

313
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:01,388
A real Yiddish train driver!

314
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,718
Long live train driver Schtrull Geitzl!

315
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:15,836
- And the locomotive?
- Almost finished. Coming from the archives.

316
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:27,269
Shalom Rabbi, Itzik...

317
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,993
Mordechai...

318
00:26:29,839 --> 00:26:33,593
Schtrull, Mendel, Schlomo...

319
00:26:34,319 --> 00:26:36,196
Doctor... Shalom.

320
00:26:36,639 --> 00:26:39,597
Why the doctor? Is anyone ill?

321
00:26:40,319 --> 00:26:43,550
No, not the locomotive!
I don't have more!

322
00:26:50,318 --> 00:26:51,671
Everything ok?

323
00:27:02,598 --> 00:27:03,951
Here it is!

324
00:27:15,317 --> 00:27:16,875
Still a little…

325
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:21,473
Very well. Now you can stop.

326
00:27:22,357 --> 00:27:23,710
Stop it.

327
00:27:26,317 --> 00:27:27,272
Come!

328
00:27:29,077 --> 00:27:32,433
- Looks like a wreck!
- We have been fooled.

329
00:27:32,877 --> 00:27:35,391
It's as good as new.
It's because of the darkness.

330
00:27:41,156 --> 00:27:42,987
Thank you. To the station.

331
00:27:44,516 --> 00:27:47,155
I hope you really know geography.

332
00:27:47,596 --> 00:27:49,871
Anyway, you know where Palestine is...

333
00:27:50,316 --> 00:27:53,672
He'll travel around the world,
believe me, Rabbi!

334
00:27:54,116 --> 00:27:55,469
Wait until tomorrow morning.

335
00:27:58,116 --> 00:28:01,313
It's because of the mist.
Wait until the sun rises.

336
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:13,944
More red! It must shine! Hurry up!

337
00:28:14,395 --> 00:28:16,351
The screw is too big!

338
00:28:25,955 --> 00:28:27,149
Hurry up!

339
00:28:51,914 --> 00:28:54,064
Shovel and coal...

340
00:28:56,094 --> 00:28:58,688
A manometer for measuring
the steam pressure…

341
00:28:59,673 --> 00:29:02,949
Must be that one.
Starting lever...

342
00:29:03,393 --> 00:29:05,304
The longest train in the world!

343
00:29:05,753 --> 00:29:08,551
- Faster than the lightning...
- It flies over the clouds!

344
00:29:08,993 --> 00:29:11,223
Completely made of gold. A magic train!

345
00:29:11,673 --> 00:29:14,243
Pity that you can't come with us.

346
00:29:16,313 --> 00:29:19,988
Goodbye, business.
Our Jews are leaving.

347
00:29:22,232 --> 00:29:26,222
Mr... Rabbi. So you can assure me
that all this is not correct,

348
00:29:27,152 --> 00:29:31,862
that it's been made up by the children?
You give me your word, right?

349
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:35,543
Don't worry. We're not going anywhere.

350
00:29:35,992 --> 00:29:40,543
I want this rumor out of the
world immediately, trust me.

351
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:49,868
We must leave immediately!
Our neighbors suspect something.

352
00:29:50,311 --> 00:29:53,525
- The Germans are coming closer!
- How soon?

353
00:29:53,734 --> 00:29:55,945
Tonight. Is the locomotive ready?

354
00:29:58,351 --> 00:30:00,184
- Well, yes.
- Then, let's go!

355
00:30:00,231 --> 00:30:03,701
We must wake up the kids.
We must tell everyone.

356
00:30:04,151 --> 00:30:07,188
- Rabbi, I am ready.
- Then let's go.

357
00:30:07,631 --> 00:30:10,020
Mordechai, take command!

358
00:30:10,471 --> 00:30:13,031
Sura, wake up the kids!

359
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:16,667
I'm not quite ready...

360
00:32:12,266 --> 00:32:14,496
God bless this train!

361
00:32:14,946 --> 00:32:17,016
That it will take us safely

362
00:32:17,466 --> 00:32:21,902
to Palestine, to the Holy Land,

363
00:32:22,345 --> 00:32:24,813
to the land of Israel! Amen!

364
00:32:36,345 --> 00:32:40,042
Children of Abraham and Moses,
get on board!

365
00:32:42,865 --> 00:32:45,743
God bless and protect you.

366
00:32:48,024 --> 00:32:49,782
Get aboard!

367
00:32:53,144 --> 00:32:55,100
Don't push! I came first!

368
00:32:59,784 --> 00:33:01,740
Give space for the elderly.

369
00:33:12,903 --> 00:33:17,055
The Germans in the green coaches!
All others in the red coaches!

370
00:33:17,503 --> 00:33:19,141
No mattresses or furniture!

371
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:22,416
Calm down! The train is leaving soon.

372
00:33:22,863 --> 00:33:26,219
Didn't you hear what I said?

373
00:33:26,663 --> 00:33:30,372
Listen, it's now 12:20 a.m.
We will leave at 12:23 a.m.

374
00:33:43,142 --> 00:33:44,894
Sit down quietly!

375
00:34:08,261 --> 00:34:10,456
Mordechai, it's time to leave!

376
00:34:11,861 --> 00:34:15,058
Schtrull! Off to Palestine!

377
00:34:17,021 --> 00:34:20,093
Fool! Depart discreetly...

378
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:12,769
God protect us!

379
00:35:19,699 --> 00:35:21,768
Grandma, we are on our way!

380
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:24,335
Yes, my angels,

381
00:35:25,418 --> 00:35:27,136
we are on our way.

382
00:35:34,858 --> 00:35:35,813
Jankele!

383
00:35:38,298 --> 00:35:40,448
The bank will grant you the credit!

384
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:06,777
They were serious.

385
00:36:07,697 --> 00:36:09,255
They did it.

386
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:12,169
They have left...

387
00:36:47,415 --> 00:36:50,771
Check if the steam pressure stands on 11,

388
00:36:51,735 --> 00:36:54,295
and that the lever is pushed forward…

389
00:36:54,935 --> 00:36:58,689
The wheels should then move forward,

390
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:02,486
that is, in clockwise direction.

391
00:37:10,654 --> 00:37:12,451
Look over there!

392
00:37:12,994 --> 00:37:17,963
Stop! We'll never make it this way.
We'll only suffer from heart attacks.

393
00:37:18,214 --> 00:37:21,570
Stop seeing Germans everywhere!

394
00:37:22,014 --> 00:37:24,184
For the time being
there aren't any.

395
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:49,206
- We are ready.
- It's early, only 30 km away!

396
00:37:49,653 --> 00:37:51,211
Shit! It's coming!

397
00:37:53,113 --> 00:37:56,887
It's unfair that some are born poor
and some born rich into this world.

398
00:37:57,032 --> 00:38:00,642
- Marx is also saying that.
- I agree with comrade Jossi und Marx.

399
00:38:01,092 --> 00:38:05,290
It would be more fair, if poor would
be born rich into this world.

400
00:38:05,972 --> 00:38:10,624
I'd gladly be a communist,
if I could keep peyots, tallit and kaftan.

401
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:11,827
Is that possible?

402
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:16,523
So you want to be a new man?
With peyots, tallit and kaftan?

403
00:38:16,972 --> 00:38:20,803
The new man is new!
The old is outdated.

404
00:38:21,011 --> 00:38:23,445
Listen... Thanks, Moitl.

405
00:38:25,451 --> 00:38:26,804
That's nice.

406
00:38:28,731 --> 00:38:32,428
Do you want to be the ideologist
of the Soviet train?

407
00:38:32,671 --> 00:38:36,789
- I haven't read Marx.
- Me neither. It doesn't matter.

408
00:38:37,031 --> 00:38:39,126
- You'll write it yourself.
- Okay.

409
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:49,248
Shit. A station!

410
00:38:49,690 --> 00:38:51,965
A ghost train!
I am not drunk.

411
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:57,165
In fifteen minutes it will collide
with the 3 o'clock express train!

412
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,521
Five, four, three...

413
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:04,926
Rabbi! Mordechai!

414
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:12,724
Dirty Nazis! Have a nice journey!

415
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:26,846
Shit! It stopped!

416
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:32,099
Where are they?
I want to talk to them.

417
00:39:32,449 --> 00:39:35,327
They are people like us.
They have a god.

418
00:39:35,769 --> 00:39:37,201
- Who?
- The Germans!

419
00:39:37,648 --> 00:39:39,878
- There are no Germans here.
- What do you mean?

420
00:39:40,328 --> 00:39:42,523
- There aren't any here.
- Why did you stop then?

421
00:39:42,968 --> 00:39:45,118
- Because it gets worse!
- Worse than the Germans?

422
00:39:45,568 --> 00:39:48,480
I don't want to know.
Tell me anyway.

423
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:53,956
- We passed a station.
- What did you expect? A harbor?

424
00:39:54,408 --> 00:39:56,205
They've discovered us!

425
00:40:02,688 --> 00:40:05,326
Our train isn't scheduled
in the timetable.

426
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:10,040
What timetable, what are you
talking about? Give it to me.

427
00:40:10,863 --> 00:40:12,316
Attention, Jews!

428
00:40:15,367 --> 00:40:20,122
New laws concerning the
population of Jewish faith...

429
00:40:23,807 --> 00:40:25,445
So it's true.

430
00:40:26,927 --> 00:40:28,678
What do we do now?

431
00:40:29,566 --> 00:40:34,105
- It's coming from the opposite direction!
- I'll blow it up! No pasaran!

432
00:40:34,246 --> 00:40:37,555
No, it's not the same!
It's a passenger train.

433
00:40:42,366 --> 00:40:46,075
There will be an entire battalion
waiting for us at the next station!

434
00:40:47,406 --> 00:40:49,442
Is that your locomotive?
That's a strange noise!

435
00:40:49,886 --> 00:40:52,923
My loco doesn't make any noise.
What are you trying to say?

436
00:40:54,645 --> 00:40:56,715
Rabbi, this line is one-track only.

437
00:40:57,965 --> 00:40:59,284
Take cover!

438
00:41:06,885 --> 00:41:10,116
A miracle! It went underground.

439
00:41:11,165 --> 00:41:14,680
Thank you, God!
Digging a tunnel in such short time...

440
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:19,717
- What? - We must tell the others that
there are no Germans here.

441
00:41:20,164 --> 00:41:24,521
They are probably already half-dead
and sticked to the walls like flies!

442
00:41:24,964 --> 00:41:28,923
I'll mobilize the council. A battalion
is waiting for us at the next station.

443
00:41:30,164 --> 00:41:33,839
I won't disobey orders given by the party.
But you are not the party!

444
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,558
What do we do?

445
00:41:38,484 --> 00:41:42,762
Everybody, get out. I must see
to the damage. No, no compensation.

446
00:41:43,444 --> 00:41:46,515
- Dad, can I talk to you?
- Is everything alright?

447
00:41:48,203 --> 00:41:49,158
Yes...

448
00:41:51,123 --> 00:41:52,476
I'm in love.

449
00:41:52,577 --> 00:41:55,477
Mazel tov, my girl,
congratulations!

450
00:41:55,843 --> 00:42:01,042
- Wonderful! Who is the happy one?
- The son of a rich man, dad.

451
00:42:03,163 --> 00:42:05,677
Samuel Schwartz, the son
of Mordechai. Sami.

452
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:10,874
What? The son of a Nazi?
He's not welcome in my house!

453
00:42:11,322 --> 00:42:13,995
What house? We live in a train.

454
00:42:14,442 --> 00:42:16,672
His grandpa was a rabbi.
He is a Jew like us.

455
00:42:17,122 --> 00:42:19,153
Sami, a real communist.

456
00:42:19,402 --> 00:42:22,978
I know what he's thinking.
He's the son of Mordechai.

457
00:42:23,122 --> 00:42:25,358
Nazi and bourgeois at the same time.

458
00:42:25,602 --> 00:42:29,494
You're wrong. His moral standards
are both proletarian and Marxist.

459
00:42:29,602 --> 00:42:32,594
- There you see, Papa.
- Not only a Nazi, but a communist as well!

460
00:42:33,042 --> 00:42:37,080
- One can't be a Nazi and a communist!
- What do you know?

461
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:40,957
I forbid you to meet him.
End of discussion!

462
00:42:42,921 --> 00:42:46,231
- Can we try to bypass them?
- No casualties.

463
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:49,320
5 lightly injured.
20 quarrels.

464
00:42:49,761 --> 00:42:53,656
Let them quarrel, it's a sign of
good health. Thanks, Jankele.

465
00:42:53,801 --> 00:42:58,272
- It's impossible to bypass all stations.
- Nothing is impossible!

466
00:42:58,721 --> 00:43:03,332
A good soldier makes anything possible.
I'm in command, I decide!

467
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:06,578
No, the people should decide!
And it has decided,

468
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:10,759
that the deportees should sleep in
the Nazi coaches. In clean sheets!

469
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:14,412
The Nazis, the bourgeois, and the
imperialists should sleep in the straw!

470
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:19,536
We also want the privileges and the
comfort that comes with being German.

471
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,872
Jossi, what are you talking about?
What is your problem?

472
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:28,231
- Jossele...
- Mama!

473
00:43:28,999 --> 00:43:30,557
My problem?

474
00:43:31,239 --> 00:43:33,707
The Germans would have
treated us better.

475
00:43:34,519 --> 00:43:37,158
They would even have offered it to us.

476
00:43:38,239 --> 00:43:41,595
- We demand justice!
- Clean sheets!

477
00:43:43,159 --> 00:43:47,418
Just what we needed.
Our community is falling apart.

478
00:43:47,559 --> 00:43:50,119
- We shouldn't have left.
- Quiet!

479
00:43:55,118 --> 00:43:58,952
You want to sleep in my bed?
Then repeat after me:

480
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:00,800
"Jawohl, mein Major!"

481
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:04,429
"Jaiwol meine majorele."

482
00:44:04,758 --> 00:44:07,336
Did you hear that?
Did I make myself clear?

483
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:11,648
With such an accent he would soon have a bullet
in his head, and everybody would be in danger.

484
00:44:11,798 --> 00:44:17,113
To be German is for those who
have earned it, who worked for it!

485
00:44:17,258 --> 00:44:18,511
Fascist!

486
00:44:23,677 --> 00:44:28,528
Stop fighting. I promise you
all clean sheets in Palestine.

487
00:44:29,037 --> 00:44:32,188
- Get back in the train.
- Keep your promises, Rabbi!

488
00:44:32,877 --> 00:44:35,068
The final struggle has only begun!

489
00:44:35,317 --> 00:44:38,356
We're entering a new chapter in history.

490
00:44:38,597 --> 00:44:41,873
Wait for it then,
don't waste your energy on it now.

491
00:44:42,117 --> 00:44:45,552
Listen. I have an idea concerning
the stations. Grossmann!

492
00:44:45,996 --> 00:44:50,792
You all know Elie Grossmann,
the chess champion. A grand strategist.

493
00:44:51,036 --> 00:44:53,755
He can help us foresee the
movements of the Germans.

494
00:44:54,196 --> 00:44:58,314
- What do you see in the map?
- I see only one possibility.

495
00:44:58,756 --> 00:45:01,748
Take a detour. To be where the
Germans don't expect us to be.

496
00:45:02,196 --> 00:45:06,951
- That'll take time. - Yes, but no one
suspects that we have a ghost train.

497
00:45:07,305 --> 00:45:11,405
- Slow and steady wins the race.
- There we go!

498
00:45:11,555 --> 00:45:13,989
And a strategist in addition? Rabbi?

499
00:45:14,435 --> 00:45:18,144
Is it clear to him that are going east,
towards Russia, and not to England?

500
00:45:18,595 --> 00:45:21,112
Doesn't matter to me.
I have family everywhere.

501
00:45:21,915 --> 00:45:26,028
- Where are the Jews?
- I don't know. They promised not to leave.

502
00:45:26,475 --> 00:45:28,784
It's not any good for me either.

503
00:45:29,235 --> 00:45:34,389
- With whom should we do business now?
- With us! And real business...

504
00:45:34,835 --> 00:45:36,631
Are you taking the role of the Jews?

505
00:45:38,114 --> 00:45:40,070
Is that supposed to be a joke?

506
00:45:47,994 --> 00:45:51,031
Come on, Schtrull, forward!

507
00:45:53,974 --> 00:45:56,204
"Why" calling "For Whom"! Hello?

508
00:45:57,194 --> 00:46:00,823
"For Whom", answer me!
Damn you, answer me now!

509
00:46:01,274 --> 00:46:02,965
Hello! "For Whom"!

510
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,525
- "Why"?
- It failed.

511
00:46:05,673 --> 00:46:07,186
- Why?
- Yes, that's me.

512
00:46:07,633 --> 00:46:10,386
- No, why did it fail?
- They changed route.

513
00:46:10,833 --> 00:46:14,648
- Blow up this train now!
- Okay, "For Whom"...

514
00:46:14,793 --> 00:46:18,832
- What do you mean, for whom? For the cause!
- What? Yeah, sure.

515
00:48:40,107 --> 00:48:44,020
Oh my god,
I'm probably next in turn…

516
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,695
I have never expected that
we should all arrive.

517
00:49:08,146 --> 00:49:12,025
But at least children and young
people should reach the frontier

518
00:49:12,466 --> 00:49:14,422
and live peacefully in Palestine.

519
00:49:14,866 --> 00:49:17,585
And grown-up men and women too.
Children need their parents.

520
00:49:18,026 --> 00:49:21,382
And since you saved all of them,
why not also elderly people?

521
00:49:21,826 --> 00:49:25,182
- What have they done to you?
- If he doesn't listen, let me talk to him.

522
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:27,879
It's not in the schedule.
It's a ghost train.

523
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:32,280
Of course... no...
It's a deportation train...

524
00:49:32,581 --> 00:49:34,881
- There are many.
- ...with Jews...

525
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,759
Most deportation trains
carry Jews, Herr Major.

526
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,760
And they are found in the schedule.

527
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:45,061
Right..? Of course...
But not this one, Herr Haupsturmführer.

528
00:49:46,137 --> 00:49:51,037
This is a top secret mission,
not included in the schedule.

529
00:49:51,562 --> 00:49:54,662
We are transporting extraordinary Jews.

530
00:49:54,763 --> 00:49:57,863
A Jew is a Jew.
What's so extraordinary with these?

531
00:49:59,065 --> 00:50:01,965
They are...

532
00:50:02,890 --> 00:50:05,290
Communist Jews.

533
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:08,660
Very dangerous ones.
Two times more dangerous.

534
00:50:09,024 --> 00:50:11,824
They are Jews and communists
at the same time.

535
00:50:12,392 --> 00:50:14,592
Transported in a single train.

536
00:50:14,867 --> 00:50:18,567
Very profitable for the Reich.
We don't have to use one train for the Jews

537
00:50:18,708 --> 00:50:21,308
and another train for the communists.

538
00:50:21,509 --> 00:50:26,209
We can't separate them, because they
are both Jews and communists.

539
00:50:26,401 --> 00:50:30,401
In that way we are saving a train.
You understand what I'm saying?

540
00:50:31,012 --> 00:50:35,812
Just think of how many Jews and
communists who would like to see us fail.

541
00:50:36,013 --> 00:50:38,613
So... no schedule.

542
00:50:39,371 --> 00:50:43,971
Ghost train.
Top, top secret.

543
00:50:44,571 --> 00:50:45,771
I understand.

544
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,876
- Do you need any escort, Herr Major?
- No, thank you.

545
00:50:49,395 --> 00:50:50,895
One last thing.

546
00:50:52,269 --> 00:50:54,569
Perhaps You can be of some help.

547
00:50:55,367 --> 00:50:58,367
All the Jews from a nearby
village have disappeared.

548
00:50:59,518 --> 00:51:01,518
Have You perhaps seen them?

549
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,897
Nearby village?

550
00:51:13,458 --> 00:51:15,558
- Disappeared, You say...?
- Yes.

551
00:51:16,526 --> 00:51:17,726
Everyone?

552
00:51:21,073 --> 00:51:22,873
I wouldn't worry about it.

553
00:51:24,064 --> 00:51:26,864
They must all be visiting some nearby place.

554
00:51:27,299 --> 00:51:29,699
They keep tight family bonds.

555
00:51:30,224 --> 00:51:32,424
They never walk alone.
They will be back.

556
00:51:32,525 --> 00:51:35,225
- Are You sure?
- Yes, sure.

557
00:51:35,426 --> 00:51:37,426
I know a bit of that.

558
00:51:37,827 --> 00:51:41,427
First they take a turn,
then they return home.

559
00:51:42,364 --> 00:51:46,264
They are undoubtedly very
attached to their original habitat.

560
00:51:49,397 --> 00:51:51,297
You are very intelligent, Herr Major.

561
00:51:51,498 --> 00:51:54,098
You have studied the
psychology of the enemy.

562
00:51:54,199 --> 00:51:57,499
I can assure you that.
Day and night!

563
00:51:59,196 --> 00:52:00,396
Heil Hitler!

564
00:52:01,879 --> 00:52:04,447
- Filthy scum!
- Filthy scum!

565
00:52:13,979 --> 00:52:18,609
Mordechai, at the next stop I'll
move back to my coach, okay?

566
00:52:33,558 --> 00:52:38,054
Saved! I told you, these
Germans are not so clever.

567
00:53:15,057 --> 00:53:17,889
We'll never get there, Mama, will we?

568
00:53:18,336 --> 00:53:21,692
- The Germans will find us and kill us.
- No, no.

569
00:53:22,616 --> 00:53:24,652
Not all Germans are bad.

570
00:53:25,256 --> 00:53:28,373
We are still on our way.

571
00:53:28,816 --> 00:53:30,772
We'll be in Palestine soon.

572
00:53:32,256 --> 00:53:34,611
Don't you already feel the desert wind?

573
00:53:36,576 --> 00:53:38,712
I will read you a story.

574
00:53:39,776 --> 00:53:43,034
There was once a paradise on earth.

575
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:48,534
A vast desert,
that seemed dry and inhospitable,

576
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:53,173
but beneath all the sandy dunes
there was a wonderful treasure.

577
00:53:53,615 --> 00:53:59,048
Green gardens, palaces,
creeks, animals, birds.

578
00:54:00,975 --> 00:54:05,234
And a strong and happy people,
who overflowed with energy…

579
00:54:07,455 --> 00:54:09,868
LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD

580
00:54:27,614 --> 00:54:30,367
The party has decided
to turn every coach into a soviet.

581
00:54:30,614 --> 00:54:35,164
As a result of the public elections,
that were kept secret,

582
00:54:35,613 --> 00:54:38,373
we have appointed a
soviet secretary for each coach.

583
00:54:38,613 --> 00:54:42,772
Sami Schwartz, the party appoints you
soviet secretary of the first coach!

584
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:45,711
- Bravo, comrade!
- So you must switch coach.

585
00:54:52,613 --> 00:54:55,029
- Fascist!
- Leave Sami alone!

586
00:54:55,173 --> 00:54:58,843
I will never marry you!
You are awake, this is not a nightmare.

587
00:54:59,093 --> 00:55:02,050
Who's talking about marriage?
Calm down.

588
00:55:02,492 --> 00:55:06,121
I don't want to marry you anymore.
I have married the Party.

589
00:55:06,572 --> 00:55:08,483
I'm not available anymore.

590
00:55:08,932 --> 00:55:10,490
Are you crazy?

591
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:40,046
Is it still a long way, grandma?

592
00:55:40,491 --> 00:55:42,049
Yes, my love.

593
00:55:42,491 --> 00:55:45,847
Is the earth holy only at one place?

594
00:55:46,491 --> 00:55:50,848
No, the earth could be holy everywhere.

595
00:55:52,330 --> 00:55:54,486
If one only want it so.

596
00:55:54,970 --> 00:55:57,120
Then it wouldn't be a long way at all...

597
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:04,962
Alright, alright.

598
00:56:45,488 --> 00:56:48,321
They are letting them out.
They are going to execute them!

599
00:56:48,768 --> 00:56:50,724
Come on, girls.

600
00:56:51,408 --> 00:56:52,761
Hurry up!

601
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:40,600
They're letting them say a last prayer!

602
00:57:56,406 --> 00:58:01,420
Mordechai, tell your men to
remove their Nazi headwear!

603
00:58:01,765 --> 00:58:05,724
Take off yours too. Your uniforms
is enough for us to bear.

604
00:58:06,165 --> 00:58:11,239
The heads stay covered. The scripts don't
say anywhere that Nazi caps aren't allowed.

605
00:58:12,845 --> 00:58:15,354
- Say something!
- Amen.

606
00:58:17,485 --> 00:58:20,283
It's for me only to decide
what my men should do.

607
00:58:20,725 --> 00:58:24,195
That goes for the deportees too.
I've got the authorization papers!

608
00:58:24,645 --> 00:58:29,399
I allow you to wear the kippah,
but my men will leave their helmets on!

609
00:58:30,104 --> 00:58:36,522
If bombers come fly over the train...
everything will look normal, and we are saved.

610
00:58:37,324 --> 00:58:39,633
- That's important!
- You're just a fake commander.

611
00:58:40,084 --> 00:58:42,518
The papers and the train too!

612
00:58:42,964 --> 00:58:47,799
We encounter real Germans every day.
Therefore we need a real commander!

613
00:58:54,403 --> 00:58:56,534
The Germans are praying with them!

614
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,436
- Are you sure?
- Well, I recognize Germans!

615
00:58:59,883 --> 00:59:03,796
- They are swaying back and forth,
with a book in their hands. - Wait.

616
00:59:04,923 --> 00:59:06,595
Fucking war!

617
00:59:08,243 --> 00:59:12,839
The Sabbath begins today.
Perhaps they are Germans of Jewish faith.

618
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:16,122
- Okay, what do we do know?
- I'm going home.

619
00:59:16,362 --> 00:59:19,832
Who knows if German Jews
are Nazis or Jews…

620
00:59:20,282 --> 00:59:24,157
But they are wearing uniforms!
They are going to kill innocent people!

621
00:59:24,402 --> 00:59:27,519
You're annoying!
Don't forget that we're writing history.

622
00:59:27,962 --> 00:59:29,714
I'm going home now!

623
00:59:30,162 --> 00:59:32,153
Commanders are always right.

624
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:35,674
If it goes wrong, history
will mention five cowards

625
00:59:36,122 --> 00:59:38,352
who escaped the scene.

626
00:59:49,481 --> 00:59:52,200
- No, no!
- What is it now?

627
00:59:52,641 --> 00:59:55,872
They're eating! They snatched my pots!
- What?

628
00:59:56,321 --> 00:59:58,994
Jossi Weintraub, what are you doing?

629
00:59:59,441 --> 01:00:00,396
Eating.

630
01:00:00,841 --> 01:00:03,357
- And the prayer? - And the meeting?
- What meeting?

631
01:00:03,401 --> 01:00:06,950
The party meeting. You are not called upon.
Continue your prayer, Rabbi.

632
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:09,197
We must eat now, or we'll be too late.

633
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:14,411
I have raised you as if you were
my own son. The Sabbath is holy.

634
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:18,011
The meeting too!
You've only taught me superstition.

635
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,879
We are Marxist-Leninist materialists!

636
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:26,273
Our Messiah has already
arrived. There is no God. - Fool!

637
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:30,429
Renegades! Come and pray!
And let the others also pray!

638
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,076
A bad example for the children.
Dirty communist!

639
01:00:34,519 --> 01:00:37,989
Dirty Nazi!
There is no God!

640
01:00:38,439 --> 01:00:41,795
I'll say it once again loud.
So that everyone can here the truth!

641
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:47,029
Don't fight! If there's a God or not,
what's the difference?

642
01:00:47,479 --> 01:00:50,994
- Have you ever asked if there's humanity?
- Stop it!

643
01:00:51,439 --> 01:00:54,890
Let him speak.
Speak, Schlomo.

644
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:06,996
"God created man in his own image."

645
01:01:08,198 --> 01:01:09,551
That's beautiful...

646
01:01:10,758 --> 01:01:12,714
Schlomo as the image of God.

647
01:01:15,358 --> 01:01:17,997
Who has written this sentence in the Torah?

648
01:01:18,798 --> 01:01:20,754
Man. Not God.

649
01:01:23,598 --> 01:01:27,476
Written without any modesty,
comparing himself to God.

650
01:01:29,277 --> 01:01:32,394
Maybe God created Man.

651
01:01:33,437 --> 01:01:36,270
But Man, the son of God,

652
01:01:37,357 --> 01:01:40,554
has created God,
in order to invent himself.

653
01:01:41,517 --> 01:01:43,109
Could you repeat that?

654
01:01:43,557 --> 01:01:47,709
Man has written the Bible
in fear of being forgotten.

655
01:01:48,157 --> 01:01:49,510
God didn't care.

656
01:01:49,956 --> 01:01:52,595
Schlomo, we already have enough troubles.

657
01:01:53,036 --> 01:01:55,311
We do not love and worship God.

658
01:01:55,756 --> 01:01:59,874
We rather ask him to help us
with our terrestrial existence.

659
01:02:00,316 --> 01:02:04,673
But we don't care about God.
We just worry about ourselves.

660
01:02:05,436 --> 01:02:09,224
So, the question is not
whether there is a God or not,

661
01:02:09,676 --> 01:02:11,792
but whether there are any of us…

662
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:15,474
Bravo, that was a beautiful prayer.

663
01:02:16,035 --> 01:02:17,388
Thank you, Schlomo.

664
01:02:17,955 --> 01:02:19,713
Sabbath shalom.

665
01:02:22,955 --> 01:02:27,790
- Did you understand him? - Of course.
God isn't sure whether there are any humans.

666
01:02:28,235 --> 01:02:32,194
"Man doesn't exist."
Do I look like a chimpanzee?

667
01:02:34,995 --> 01:02:36,553
It's your move.

668
01:02:40,451 --> 01:02:42,008
One less.

669
01:02:42,274 --> 01:02:44,704
Schlomo, why are you the fool?

670
01:02:45,854 --> 01:02:49,007
I wanted to be a rabbi,
but the position was occupied.

671
01:02:49,154 --> 01:02:53,313
When they looked for a fool, I thought
that I could be crazy on their behalf.

672
01:02:54,474 --> 01:02:57,732
- Don't you ever feel lonely?
- No, there are enough crazy people.

673
01:02:57,974 --> 01:02:59,853
I was talking about a woman.

674
01:03:00,874 --> 01:03:04,992
Why didn't you ever have
a wife, children and a home?

675
01:03:05,994 --> 01:03:10,145
I'm not that crazy...
Does it bother you if I take your queen?

676
01:03:11,833 --> 01:03:15,382
I would love them too much.
I would die of love.

677
01:03:15,993 --> 01:03:18,553
Or get crazy.

678
01:03:19,193 --> 01:03:21,991
Mordechai, we're running out of supplies.

679
01:03:25,433 --> 01:03:27,389
- What should we do?
- Shop for more.

680
01:03:28,273 --> 01:03:31,185
Are you crazy?
We can't go shopping in a village.

681
01:03:31,633 --> 01:03:33,827
"Heil, shalom! 1 kilo of carrots, please."

682
01:03:34,272 --> 01:03:37,166
The children will soon have
nothing more to eat.

683
01:03:37,312 --> 01:03:39,462
- Whose money are we going to use?
- No!

684
01:03:39,912 --> 01:03:44,285
I don't have any more money. I need every
penny for Schwartz and Son in Palestine.

685
01:03:44,432 --> 01:03:49,487
There's no more Son. Sami is a communist.
Me, Schwartz... I'm about to go crazy.

686
01:03:57,212 --> 01:03:58,685
Well, okay...

687
01:03:59,311 --> 01:04:02,064
If we all die, we wont need
Schwartz and Son in Palestine.

688
01:04:02,511 --> 01:04:06,220
No one would buy.
No one would sell.

689
01:04:12,351 --> 01:04:13,704
Turn around.

690
01:04:14,871 --> 01:04:16,429
Love me, Sami.

691
01:04:16,871 --> 01:04:18,509
Now you may.

692
01:04:18,951 --> 01:04:21,242
You do not have any
responsibilities any longer.

693
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:25,906
I don't get it. Expelled from the
party for no reason, it's not fair!

694
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:31,026
It's hard to love a Nazi communist
when I only want to make...

695
01:04:31,470 --> 01:04:34,543
I must be crazy.
I will die a virgin.

696
01:04:34,690 --> 01:04:39,249
- I had to keep our relationship a secret and
I can't tell my comrades... - Ex-comrades!

697
01:04:39,390 --> 01:04:41,424
...that I have the most beautiful girl.

698
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:47,283
- All because of your father, the old fanatic!
- Don't call him that. You have a Nazi father!

699
01:04:54,829 --> 01:04:56,387
And this?

700
01:04:56,829 --> 01:05:00,378
Isn't this more valuable than all of
Marx, Engels and Lenin together?

701
01:05:29,588 --> 01:05:31,306
Wake up!

702
01:05:31,748 --> 01:05:33,704
It's 2:00 a.m.

703
01:05:40,827 --> 01:05:41,782
Come.

704
01:05:42,227 --> 01:05:43,376
Sami, come.

705
01:05:46,387 --> 01:05:47,740
Come on.

706
01:05:52,027 --> 01:05:52,982
No.

707
01:05:58,132 --> 01:05:59,685
Mordechai, open up!

708
01:06:00,227 --> 01:06:03,663
- What? The Germans?
- No. They have escaped!

709
01:06:04,629 --> 01:06:06,547
- Who?
- The deportees.

710
01:06:30,266 --> 01:06:33,974
Look, what they have done
to my train. Savages!

711
01:06:34,425 --> 01:06:39,260
- They wanted to blow up the locomotive!
- Let's leave now. They will soon be arrested.

712
01:06:39,705 --> 01:06:41,900
We shouldn't lose more time!

713
01:06:42,345 --> 01:06:43,300
No!

714
01:06:44,305 --> 01:06:47,397
They are our brothers
and sisters. Jews like us.

715
01:06:47,545 --> 01:06:51,215
- We can't leave them behind.
- Damn communists!

716
01:06:51,265 --> 01:06:53,137
They are our people!

717
01:06:53,585 --> 01:06:57,816
If they are arrested and tortured,
we wouldn't come very far.

718
01:06:58,264 --> 01:07:01,574
We should arrive in Palestine
all together. So it is written.

719
01:07:02,024 --> 01:07:03,377
I have an idea.

720
01:07:06,904 --> 01:07:10,260
Very good, my dear panhandler!

721
01:07:21,744 --> 01:07:24,257
Comrades, let's separate. Good luck!

722
01:07:24,703 --> 01:07:27,297
We'll meet at the Red Square.

723
01:07:27,743 --> 01:07:29,779
Proletarians of all countries, unite!

724
01:07:30,323 --> 01:07:32,778
But you just said we
should separate..!

725
01:07:33,823 --> 01:07:37,293
Barbarian! That's my only coat.
You've destroyed it, look!

726
01:07:37,743 --> 01:07:40,052
You're more brutal than the Germans!

727
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:49,858
- Fascist!
- Jossi! Wait, I want to talk to you.

728
01:07:50,662 --> 01:07:52,459
Why did you do that?

729
01:07:53,342 --> 01:07:54,695
Tell me.

730
01:07:59,822 --> 01:08:04,020
Everyone aboard? We're leaving.
Next time I'll give my men the right to shoot.

731
01:08:04,462 --> 01:08:08,498
- The regulations must be respected.
- Shoot at your brothers?

732
01:08:08,542 --> 01:08:12,301
Wait! We can't leave yet.
One is missing. Lilenfeld the tailor.

733
01:08:21,341 --> 01:08:22,694
I can't manage.

734
01:08:34,781 --> 01:08:36,578
I'm here!

735
01:08:37,381 --> 01:08:40,133
I surrender. I got lost.

736
01:08:45,963 --> 01:08:47,621
I'm a Jew just like you.

737
01:08:54,820 --> 01:08:59,291
We should leave! They will torture him
until he tells where the train is.

738
01:08:59,740 --> 01:09:03,316
- No! We must rescue him!
- Rescue him!

739
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:06,610
They are better armed.
Their officer is above me in rank.

740
01:09:07,059 --> 01:09:09,414
Torches are not enough.

741
01:09:09,859 --> 01:09:14,171
You don't know what a real Nazi is.
Only I know.

742
01:09:14,619 --> 01:09:17,179
- Only me.
- I have an idea...

743
01:09:20,139 --> 01:09:22,334
You fool!

744
01:09:57,254 --> 01:09:58,654
Heil Hitler!

745
01:09:59,404 --> 01:10:01,704
Oberstleutnant Andreas von Glück
at Your service!

746
01:10:01,805 --> 01:10:03,805
I have come to take my Jew back.

747
01:10:04,006 --> 01:10:06,306
Excuse me, Feldmarschall,
but it is my Jew.

748
01:10:06,407 --> 01:10:08,707
No, he's mine.
He escaped from my train.

749
01:10:08,908 --> 01:10:12,908
But he is in my prison.
He must be interrogated.

750
01:10:14,828 --> 01:10:18,028
Why are you so fond
of having a Jew here?

751
01:10:18,479 --> 01:10:21,179
That could be seen
as a bit odd...

752
01:10:21,698 --> 01:10:28,098
Do you have a particular, secret, admiration
for these Jews, and for Judaism in general?

753
01:10:29,143 --> 01:10:34,543
Is it part of your family?
And are you thus Jewish yourself?

754
01:10:35,020 --> 01:10:37,320
What?

755
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:42,576
No! Is this a joke?

756
01:10:42,955 --> 01:10:46,355
I'm not Jewish, I have an entire
family tree file stating the opposite!

757
01:10:46,556 --> 01:10:48,956
I strongly doubt that!

758
01:10:49,459 --> 01:10:51,859
I can see what your heart is made of.

759
01:10:52,060 --> 01:10:57,560
Wanting to keep a Jewish prisoner
is indeed very suspect.

760
01:10:58,136 --> 01:11:03,036
I even suspect that it is
your intention

761
01:11:03,137 --> 01:11:07,037
to release him, or even worse,
to protect him.

762
01:11:07,745 --> 01:11:13,445
- Maybe you fancy him and want to start
a relation with him..? - What?

763
01:11:13,982 --> 01:11:17,982
An amicable relation?
Or even more?

764
01:11:18,183 --> 01:11:21,483
Go ahead, take the Jew,
I'll give him to you.

765
01:11:21,684 --> 01:11:24,284
I don't want him.
I don't need him anymore.

766
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:28,922
Bring the Jewish prisoner!
Quickly!

767
01:11:31,454 --> 01:11:36,005
You're a real master of the Talmud,
all annotations and interpretations...

768
01:11:36,808 --> 01:11:38,808
Thank you. Heil Hitler.

769
01:11:39,152 --> 01:11:40,052
L'chaim.

770
01:11:47,179 --> 01:11:48,079
What's wrong?

771
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:51,380
That will stop you from breaking
out again, you dirty dog!

772
01:11:51,481 --> 01:11:53,481
Take him to his coach!

773
01:11:54,102 --> 01:11:57,902
Now gather all your men
and all the villagers.

774
01:11:58,293 --> 01:11:59,646
Don't exaggerate. Let's go!

775
01:11:59,847 --> 01:12:01,647
No, he must be punished!

776
01:12:02,048 --> 01:12:02,848
Punished!

777
01:12:03,049 --> 01:12:04,649
Yes, Sir!

778
01:12:07,852 --> 01:12:10,127
What's going on?

779
01:12:15,725 --> 01:12:20,425
Everybody should bring food.
I must renew my supplies.

780
01:12:21,223 --> 01:12:25,623
- Some ovens also so that we can cook!
- Yes, Sir!

781
01:12:27,095 --> 01:12:30,167
Please, Mordechai, let's leave!

782
01:12:33,697 --> 01:12:35,497
Nice, isn't it?

783
01:12:35,713 --> 01:12:38,113
- Is it kosher?
- What?

784
01:12:38,546 --> 01:12:41,746
Cushion! I mean, has it
lied down properly?

785
01:12:44,803 --> 01:12:48,103
Liars! This meat hasn't lied down at all!

786
01:12:48,417 --> 01:12:50,217
Do you want to poison us?

787
01:12:50,318 --> 01:12:52,718
We can lay it down now,
if you want.

788
01:12:52,919 --> 01:12:55,819
It must lie down
all from the beginning.

789
01:12:56,257 --> 01:12:59,457
Get my Hakham...
Hrrmm...

790
01:13:00,252 --> 01:13:02,052
Bless you.

791
01:13:03,285 --> 01:13:06,285
...my butcher, my chefs,
and my casseroles.

792
01:13:06,386 --> 01:13:07,986
I have no confidence in you!

793
01:13:08,087 --> 01:13:11,087
Bring me all animals you have!
Alive!

794
01:13:11,188 --> 01:13:12,488
Yes, Sir!

795
01:13:19,610 --> 01:13:24,446
Filled carpfish. Pastrami cold cuts.
Oh, I love those!

796
01:13:28,649 --> 01:13:31,502
Filled carpfish... exquisite!

797
01:13:34,191 --> 01:13:35,849
- We're ready.
- Good.

798
01:14:06,528 --> 01:14:08,444
So long, asshole!

799
01:14:20,967 --> 01:14:25,843
I swear you, our own Nazis
are true angels!

800
01:14:26,087 --> 01:14:29,697
Human, genuine Jews,
I came to understand that finally.

801
01:14:29,847 --> 01:14:34,698
The others are true monsters,
you can't imagine...

802
01:14:34,847 --> 01:14:37,998
They've only released him,
so that he could spy on us.

803
01:14:38,446 --> 01:14:43,042
He works for Mordechai and his partners.
This is an anti-revolutionary act.

804
01:14:43,486 --> 01:14:47,365
I propose exclusion from
the party. Who's for?

805
01:14:48,366 --> 01:14:50,941
Who's against?
You're unanimously excluded!

806
01:14:51,086 --> 01:14:55,523
Traitor! A spy for imperialist
and fascist powers!

807
01:14:55,966 --> 01:15:00,835
The Supreme Soviet of coach number two
will decide your new place of residence.

808
01:15:01,286 --> 01:15:04,359
You must stay inside your coach
for the rest of the trip.

809
01:15:04,405 --> 01:15:08,100
You are neither allowed to step out,
nor to talk with the others.

810
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:10,436
All food was kosher.

811
01:15:10,885 --> 01:15:14,863
Only Jews eat it that way.
My wife says so.

812
01:15:14,905 --> 01:15:18,915
She used to work for
the Rudenbaums, Herr Oberst...

813
01:15:19,065 --> 01:15:20,339
Kosher!?

814
01:15:21,085 --> 01:15:24,634
Ghost train!
Now you're telling me!

815
01:15:25,085 --> 01:15:27,440
You're going to rot in jail!

816
01:15:36,284 --> 01:15:37,603
Listen.

817
01:15:38,044 --> 01:15:41,116
You saved him.
Everyone is proud of you.

818
01:15:41,564 --> 01:15:45,273
- We'll be in Russia soon. Free.
- Proud of me...

819
01:15:46,524 --> 01:15:48,958
- They do not like me.
- What are you talking about?

820
01:15:49,404 --> 01:15:50,757
That is true.

821
01:15:51,764 --> 01:15:54,722
Nobody would lift a finger for me.

822
01:15:55,164 --> 01:15:56,994
Nobody, understand?

823
01:15:57,443 --> 01:16:00,640
Not even Sami, my own son.

824
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:03,358
When I faced the Germans,

825
01:16:03,803 --> 01:16:08,797
I felt the whole community holding
its breath behind my back.

826
01:16:09,243 --> 01:16:11,393
Are you afraid of me? No.

827
01:16:13,283 --> 01:16:16,992
Everybody trembles, wishing for my success
and that the train departs safely.

828
01:16:18,483 --> 01:16:21,758
When they imagine the worst,
guess what they to think.

829
01:16:22,202 --> 01:16:24,432
That I'll be the first to bite the dust.

830
01:16:24,882 --> 01:16:27,237
You know that's not true.

831
01:16:28,482 --> 01:16:32,794
I only obey the will of the rabbi and
the advice of the council. And God.

832
01:16:35,082 --> 01:16:38,313
I would even become a real Nazi
out of love for my people...

833
01:16:38,762 --> 01:16:43,233
if it would bring them safely to Palestine.
Why do I get accused now?

834
01:16:44,842 --> 01:16:46,400
You are crazy.

835
01:16:48,401 --> 01:16:50,471
Would you burn your own people?

836
01:16:51,401 --> 01:16:55,394
Would you treat them like animals,
separate children from parents,

837
01:16:55,841 --> 01:16:57,797
brothers from sisters,
husbands from wives?

838
01:16:58,241 --> 01:17:01,517
Because the rabbi and the council
requires it? Would you do that?

839
01:17:01,961 --> 01:17:03,713
What are you trying to say?

840
01:17:04,161 --> 01:17:07,358
I wouldn't burn or do
any harm to anyone.

841
01:17:09,641 --> 01:17:13,030
This train is crazy,
it makes us all crazy.

842
01:17:13,480 --> 01:17:16,233
- Someone got this crazy idea...
- It was me.

843
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:17,795
Really?

844
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,436
Then everything is okay.

845
01:17:28,760 --> 01:17:31,433
Schtrull, you idiot!
Learn to drive...

846
01:17:37,172 --> 01:17:38,272
Heil Hitler!

847
01:17:38,573 --> 01:17:41,073
Everybody out.
We'll seize control of this train.

848
01:17:41,174 --> 01:17:42,674
What? My train?

849
01:17:42,775 --> 01:17:44,175
Orders from the Führer.

850
01:17:44,279 --> 01:17:47,396
O God!
It would be too beautiful...

851
01:17:48,559 --> 01:17:50,993
if you lets us fail so near our goal.

852
01:17:51,439 --> 01:17:54,590
Sometimes I ask myself
if You are a sadist.

853
01:17:55,359 --> 01:17:57,554
You notice our misfortune.

854
01:17:57,999 --> 01:18:01,878
Or do You look the other way
in order not to be shocked?

855
01:19:04,676 --> 01:19:07,474
- Mordechai, don't you hear his accent?
- His or mine?

856
01:19:08,148 --> 01:19:13,048
Mordechai?
Is that you name?

857
01:19:25,435 --> 01:19:27,744
Schlomo, my brother, you're alive!

858
01:19:28,195 --> 01:19:30,584
Manzatu, Gypsy brother, how are you?

859
01:19:31,035 --> 01:19:32,991
This is Schlomo! They are all Jews!

860
01:19:33,435 --> 01:19:36,593
They are Gypsies!
Nazis and deportees! Like us.

861
01:19:36,836 --> 01:19:41,036
I'm in command! I decide!
I want this train!

862
01:19:41,722 --> 01:19:45,922
I had it! It was mine!

863
01:19:46,010 --> 01:19:50,010
I've had enough of this!
I never wanted to be a Nazi!

864
01:19:50,111 --> 01:19:52,911
Me neither.
I understand you!

865
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:54,910
- Where are you heading?
- India. And you?

866
01:19:55,354 --> 01:19:56,469
Palestine.

867
01:19:57,554 --> 01:20:00,671
They are not Germans!
They are Gypsies!

868
01:20:01,114 --> 01:20:03,669
Listen! Take your weapons away!

869
01:20:03,914 --> 01:20:08,465
They're all Jews. Not a single German
or anything like it. Come!

870
01:20:19,113 --> 01:20:22,901
God is great. The train is small,
but there is place for everyone.

871
01:20:23,353 --> 01:20:26,948
Deportees to the Deportees.
Germans to the Germans.

872
01:20:36,513 --> 01:20:39,231
Rabbi, are the pigs allowed
to board the train?

873
01:20:39,672 --> 01:20:41,503
God will understand.

874
01:20:41,952 --> 01:20:44,830
- Should I make a note?
- Whatever.

875
01:20:45,953 --> 01:20:47,253
Please.

876
01:20:48,112 --> 01:20:52,412
Please take the bed,
I'll sleep on the couch.

877
01:20:53,354 --> 01:20:54,754
Thank you.

878
01:20:55,801 --> 01:20:58,301
I was not in doubt
that you were a Jew.

879
01:20:58,548 --> 01:21:00,848
A German would have obeyed
me without any discussion.

880
01:21:02,095 --> 01:21:03,195
Heil Hitler!

881
01:21:46,637 --> 01:21:50,735
Papa. You were right.
I have left Sami.

882
01:21:51,030 --> 01:21:54,180
Mazel tov, my daughter,
let me embrace you.

883
01:21:54,909 --> 01:21:57,139
You have listened to your father.

884
01:21:57,589 --> 01:22:02,419
Don't be sad. There will be thousands
of others. You are young and pretty.

885
01:22:03,109 --> 01:22:06,545
Yes, Papa, there is already
another man that I love.

886
01:22:06,989 --> 01:22:07,944
Already?

887
01:22:08,389 --> 01:22:11,506
Mazel tov...
Who is the gentleman?

888
01:22:13,069 --> 01:22:15,105
Miron Pastai, the Gypsy.

889
01:22:16,789 --> 01:22:17,744
My daughter...

890
01:22:18,869 --> 01:22:20,620
I prefer the Nazi...

891
01:22:21,168 --> 01:22:23,124
My son, you have changed.

892
01:22:24,268 --> 01:22:27,385
You were good looking,
wanted to make good

893
01:22:27,828 --> 01:22:29,625
you had dreams,

894
01:22:30,068 --> 01:22:32,024
you had a God.

895
01:22:33,428 --> 01:22:34,986
What are you becoming?

896
01:22:35,868 --> 01:22:37,665
Is that communism?

897
01:22:41,068 --> 01:22:44,026
I will be with you
till the end of the world.

898
01:22:45,587 --> 01:22:46,781
Jossi...

899
01:22:48,587 --> 01:22:50,145
My Jossele...

900
01:22:51,707 --> 01:22:53,265
you were a communist,

901
01:22:54,467 --> 01:22:56,423
but became a human again...

902
01:23:12,866 --> 01:23:14,822
They are really sick!

903
01:23:21,586 --> 01:23:25,215
They're barbequing pork.
Is the fire still kosher?

904
01:23:26,506 --> 01:23:27,859
I understand.

905
01:23:31,106 --> 01:23:33,062
- One more time, please
- No. Tomorrow.

906
01:23:33,506 --> 01:23:35,337
- No, now.
- Tomorrow.

907
01:23:35,786 --> 01:23:39,903
- And if there is no tomorrow?
- Today will stop being today sometime.

908
01:23:40,345 --> 01:23:43,621
- Then morning starts.
- So there is a tomorrow.

909
01:23:44,065 --> 01:23:46,021
Yes, but not today.

910
01:23:55,425 --> 01:23:56,778
Thanks, cutie.

911
01:24:05,784 --> 01:24:08,582
Not very nice of you
to spy like that...

912
01:24:11,344 --> 01:24:12,697
I wasn't spying.

913
01:24:13,864 --> 01:24:17,015
- You wanted to start a fire?
- Me? No, never!

914
01:24:17,824 --> 01:24:20,418
Should I put out your fire?

915
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,980
- No, it's not...
- Yes...

916
01:24:24,424 --> 01:24:28,814
The Party does not allow any
hot, non-political love...

917
01:24:30,623 --> 01:24:32,420
Make yourself ready, cutie.

918
01:24:32,863 --> 01:24:36,219
Tonight I will love both
you and your party

919
01:24:36,663 --> 01:24:39,131
in a way you've never
been loved before.

920
01:24:39,863 --> 01:24:41,819
A true revolution.

921
01:24:42,943 --> 01:24:47,733
Unbendingly fight to get through.
You know what I'm talking about.

922
01:24:59,542 --> 01:25:02,693
Don't touch my cow.
She is kosher.

923
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:51,010
Have you swallowed your Stradivarius?

924
01:25:51,460 --> 01:25:54,975
They still believe that they
invented the violin. Play!

925
01:27:31,256 --> 01:27:32,609
Come on!

926
01:28:38,694 --> 01:28:41,811
What's all this "no" about?

927
01:28:43,814 --> 01:28:45,769
Why "no" all the time?

928
01:28:46,213 --> 01:28:50,126
- What are you doing here?
- He represents a third of our community.

929
01:28:50,773 --> 01:28:51,831
He should be here.

930
01:28:51,932 --> 01:28:53,832
We could still turn back.

931
01:28:53,933 --> 01:28:58,633
All Germans are gathered here,
at the front. We wont get through.

932
01:28:58,936 --> 01:29:02,436
So all of this for nothing?
We should try get through!

933
01:29:03,373 --> 01:29:05,425
- Whose in faver?
- What did he say?

934
01:29:05,673 --> 01:29:07,231
Who is in favor?

935
01:29:17,172 --> 01:29:18,525
Do you want something?

936
01:29:21,332 --> 01:29:22,685
Then go away.

937
01:29:30,092 --> 01:29:31,445
Tell me, Schlomo...

938
01:29:32,532 --> 01:29:34,887
Have you ever desired a woman?

939
01:29:36,451 --> 01:29:39,490
Have you ever loved a woman
and wanted to live with her?

940
01:29:43,611 --> 01:29:44,885
Yes.

941
01:29:48,851 --> 01:29:50,967
Have you ever loved a woman?

942
01:30:03,850 --> 01:30:05,408
Long time ago?

943
01:30:10,610 --> 01:30:12,407
Do you still love her?

944
01:30:20,210 --> 01:30:22,166
We're going to die, Schlomo.

945
01:30:25,650 --> 01:30:27,002
Who is the woman?

946
01:30:33,249 --> 01:30:34,204
It's you.

947
01:31:54,606 --> 01:31:56,324
Schtrull, stop.

948
01:31:57,006 --> 01:32:00,203
It should be here. Stop the train.

949
01:32:02,166 --> 01:32:06,284
- Have you found it?
- No, not yet. We're still looking.

950
01:32:10,165 --> 01:32:13,980
Do you think the Germans hate us so much
that they have hidden the front line

951
01:32:14,125 --> 01:32:15,797
just to drive us crazy?

952
01:32:16,245 --> 01:32:19,203
- What have we done to them?
- I don't know.

953
01:32:23,925 --> 01:32:25,677
O my God, the Germans!

954
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:27,738
This is the end!

955
01:32:31,165 --> 01:32:34,998
No! We've arrived!
We're at the front!

956
01:32:36,084 --> 01:32:40,441
Both sides are shooting!
We're right in the middle!

957
01:32:41,084 --> 01:32:42,437
We are free!

958
01:33:22,223 --> 01:33:27,073
When we arrived in the Soviet Union
most of us stayed and became communists.

959
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:31,231
Others went to Palestine,
especially the Gypsies...

960
01:33:31,682 --> 01:33:34,992
Others yet went to India,
also many Jews.

961
01:33:35,642 --> 01:33:40,638
Schtrull went all the way to China, where he
became station-master in a small village.

962
01:33:44,362 --> 01:33:47,160
The beautiful Esther went to America.

963
01:33:47,602 --> 01:33:50,400
She got many children.
One prettier than the other.

964
01:33:53,601 --> 01:33:56,320
That's the true story of my Shtetl.

965
01:33:58,521 --> 01:34:01,318
Well, almost true anyway...

966
01:34:03,841 --> 01:34:06,401
Shtetl, Shtetl, Shtetele...

967
01:34:07,001 --> 01:34:09,515
Don't forget me, Shtetele.

968
01:34:09,961 --> 01:34:12,429
One day I'll take a train

969
01:34:12,881 --> 01:34:14,837
and travel far away.

970
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:21,108
Don't let people loose their eyes.

971
01:34:21,560 --> 01:34:23,835
They keep me alive,

972
01:34:24,280 --> 01:34:26,236
their sublime lunacy.

973
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:32,356
Train of life...
