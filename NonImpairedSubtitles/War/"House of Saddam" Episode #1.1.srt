1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:06,200
'and I have a message for them.'

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:08,600
The tyrant will soon be gone.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:12,000
The day of your liberation is near.

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,700
'All the decades of deceit
and cruelty have now reached an end.

5
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:23,300
'Saddam Hussein and his sons
must leave Iraq within 48 hours.'

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:27,000
Their refusal to do so
will result in military conflict

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,900
commenced at a time
of our choosing.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:35,500
'Events in Iraq have now reached
the final days of decision.'

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:42,500
Where's Mama? Inside,
she's packing. Why is she packing?

10
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:45,100
Mama, what are you doing?
We can buy new glasses.

11
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,600
Make sure your mother and sisters
have money.

12
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,300
Go, and make sure they listen.

13
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:54,900
'They must leave the country
immediately.' Mustafa, the suitcases.

14
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,400
Hala, quickly.

15
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,500
'But we will not leave Iraq.'

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,600
We keep moving until the Americans
are defeated. Yes, Papa. Now go.

17
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,700
Take care of your brother, Qusay.

18
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,600
I will.

19
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:16,200
Mama, they are not important.
We have to go.

20
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,500
This programme contains some strong
language and some violent scenes.

21
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,600
EXCITED CHATTERING

22
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,700
MUSIC PLAYS

23
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,400
INDISTINCT

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,500
Is that my little mouse?

25
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,300
HE LAUGHS

26
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,400
Are you enjoying your party?
Saddam...

27
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,100
Ready when you are. Ah.

28
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:38,100
Let's go and find Mama.

29
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:41,300
I'll just be a moment, Barzan.

30
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,500
Mm?

31
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,700
This little mousey belongs to you.

32
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,500
Habibti.

33
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,900
What time will he come? Soon.

34
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:03,000
Mr Deputy. Mm.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,400
Are they all here?

36
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,900
Yes, everyone's here.

37
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,600
Khomeini has a big mouth.

38
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,200
Mm.

39
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:12,800
SHOUTING ON TV

40
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
Thank you, Hamdani.

41
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,500
PEOPLE CHANT:

42
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,700
Heard enough? More than enough.

43
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:35,800
He is a thoughtless son of a bitch.

44
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,900
Bark, bark, bark, all day long -
every day.

45
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:40,700
He is a dog with teeth, Ali.

46
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,300
Sharp teeth.

47
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:46,500
We can offer a hand of friendship
but he will bite it off.

48
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,800
He wants his revolution
to infect all of the Arab world.

49
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,900
Beginning with the Iraqi Shia.

50
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,700
Exactly.

51
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,300
He will become more and more
dangerous by the day.

52
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:59,200
Comrades...

53
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,700
time is running out.

54
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,900
America hopes for a strong Iraq.

55
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,900
The Arab world demands it. The Iraqi
people themselves deserve it.

56
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,800
To the revolution.

57
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,100
To the party.

58
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,300
To unity.

59
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,300
To a new Iraq.

60
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:24,200
ALL: To a new Iraq.

61
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,000
INDISTINCT CHATTER

62
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,900
I'll be out here.

63
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:40,100
Mama.

64
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,900
How is the lemonade?

65
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,700
It's too sweet.

66
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,200
Raghad.

67
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,600
Find Mohammed.

68
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,700
Ask him to join the party,
he's shy. Yes.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,300
She's becoming a woman.

70
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,200
She's still my baby.

71
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,100
She should marry
Barzan's son, Mohammed.

72
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,000
It will bond the family
closer still.

73
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:16,000
Mr Deputy,
the President is about to arrive.

74
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,300
Mama, excuse me.

75
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,700
Mr President. Mr Deputy.

76
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,900
Sajida, you look beautiful.

77
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,800
You are too kind.

78
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:46,000
Thank you so much for coming,
Mr President. Hala will be thrilled.

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,300
Not at all,
thank you for inviting an old man

80
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:49,800
to a seventh birthday party.

81
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,200
It is an important occasion.

82
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:59,000
Please, please, everybody.
Please, carry on.

83
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,600
Where is the birthday girl?

84
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,200
I can't see her. Here she is.

85
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,500
Where? Where? Here. Here.

86
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:09,400
All I see is a grown-up princess.
Where is little Hala?

87
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,500
It's me, it's me!

88
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,900
Then this gift must be yours,
princess. You're very kind.

89
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,300
What do we say to the President?

90
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,000
Thank you.
You are very welcome, my child.

91
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,100
ALL: # Happy Birthday to you

92
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,800
# Happy Birthday to you

93
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:38,300
# Happy Birthday, dear Hala

94
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:43,100
# Happy Birthday to you. #

95
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:48,100
Make a wish, habibti,
and your dreams will come true.

96
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,900
CHEERING

97
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,300
Let's leave the women
and children to their games.

98
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,100
We have much to discuss,
Mr President.

99
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,000
You must save me a piece of cake.
Of course I will.

100
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
LAUGHTER

101
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,000
Mr President...

102
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:36,700
Please, sit down.

103
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:39,600
There is something I have to say.

104
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,600
I smell disquiet.

105
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,200
I am concerned about Khomeini

106
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,200
and the proposed union with Syria.

107
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:05,800
Khomeini continues to call on
our people to join his revolution
because he knows we are weak.

108
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:10,900
And this alliance with Syria
will make us weaker still. Nonsense.

109
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:13,800
Two Arab people together
will make a strong alliance.

110
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,500
Headed by the Syrian President.

111
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:19,600
Assad of Syria will be first
and you will be second.

112
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:23,100
With Saddam Hussein third?
HE LAUGHS

113
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,600
Is that your true objection?

114
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,000
I have no objection.

115
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,500
Why object to something
that does not exist?

116
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,600
And will never exist.

117
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:39,000
I will not allow it.

118
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:43,000
You will not allow it, Mr Deputy?

119
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,800
I smell more than disquiet.

120
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,700
Comrade Bakr, it's over.

121
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,200
Stop. Say no more.

122
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,400
Saddam...

123
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:01,000
your time will come.

124
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,400
We are a team, you and me.
Look at what we have accomplished.

125
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,300
Look at what you have accomplished.

126
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:11,800
Iraq has schools and hospitals
and food for all of the people.

127
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,600
For the first time in our history,

128
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,700
their minds are developed
and their bellies are full,

129
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:20,300
because of you and me.

130
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,400
Our country is just beginning
to walk in the world.

131
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,500
This alliance, us,
we will make Iraq stronger.

132
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,900
So...

133
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,200
do I get to eat my cake now?

134
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:37,500
It is over, comrade.

135
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,700
DOORS OPEN

136
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,500
They won't help you.

137
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:52,800
Either you resign voluntarily
or through force.

138
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,600
Either way, you resign.

139
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,800
You have earned your retirement

140
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,100
and it is the wish of each of us

141
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:03,800
that you get to enjoy it.

142
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:11,200
Adnan Khairallah, you are my Defence
Minister and an officer in my army.

143
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,600
Come and stand by my side
and this...this will be forgotten.

144
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,800
Hamdani, we think alike you and me.

145
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:26,500
Stand by my side.

146
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:31,700
You will announce your retirement
due to ill-health

147
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,300
and you will name your deputy
as your successor.

148
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,100
The Command Council
will never approve it.

149
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:44,700
You can remain in the Presidential
Palace until matters are resolved.

150
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,200
Comrade.

151
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:07,500
Saddam Hussein al-Majid.
My President.

152
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,600
Tariq Aziz.

153
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,000
My President.

154
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,000
Hamdani, my friend.

155
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,800
Mr President.

156
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,000
So, it's done.

157
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,900
You are to be President.

158
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:44,700
Now you will need your brothers
more than ever. Yes, Mama.

159
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:50,100
And no-one must be allowed to do to
you, what you have done to al-Bakr.

160
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,700
Don't worry, Mama.

161
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,600
I am making Barzan
my head of security.

162
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:57,400
I'll protect him, Mama.

163
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,900
Let's put you to bed.

164
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,400
Good boy.

165
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,200
I feel like tomorrow, I will
wake up in a land of...progress

166
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:18,700
and opportunity.

167
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,400
I have ideas to help build Iraq,

168
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:26,700
make it ready to take
its rightful place in the world,

169
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,500
and not just the Arab world.

170
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,600
We have a lot of work to do.

171
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,900
Me and you.

172
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,300
And I will always be by your side.

173
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,300
Already I feel different.

174
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:44,500
You feel empowered. Yes.

175
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,000
And you like it?

176
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,500
HE LAUGHS
Yes, very much.

177
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:52,100
THEY LAUGH

178
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,700
What's so funny?
Hamdani likes power.

179
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,500
Yes.

180
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,300
What's wrong with that?

181
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,700
'It is my view that the man best
qualified to assume the leadership'

182
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:15,000
is my esteemed deputy,
Comrade Saddam Hussein.

183
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,100
Mr President, this is absurd!

184
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,000
Now is not the time
to be stepping aside.

185
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:25,900
We are on the brink
of a new era in Arab brotherhood.

186
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,100
Comrade Mashhadi,
he has made up his mind.

187
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,700
We must respect his decision.

188
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,900
Mr President, what's going on here?
What is happening?

189
00:13:36,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Please comrade, please,
I'm very tired.

190
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:46,500
Then we can only accept your
recommendation by a unanimous vote.

191
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:50,500
Very well, we will have a vote
in our next session.

192
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,800
The members of the council
will need some time

193
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,600
for thoughts and reflection.

194
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:02,100
CLAPPING

195
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,300
Where is Hamdani? I don't know.

196
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,700
Comrades...

197
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,200
it causes me great pain

198
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,300
that one of my first duties
as President

199
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,500
is to tell you that we have
uncovered an atrocious plot

200
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,000
against our beloved Ba'ath Party.

201
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,700
You can end this now.

202
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,900
Just do what we need and confirm it.

203
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:43,100
My pain is not eased by the fact
that these collaborators

204
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,700
are sitting amongst us here.

205
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:49,300
Or...things can get worse.

206
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,900
The witness.

207
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,600
MURMURING

208
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,300
Now I want you to imagine
your daughter sitting

209
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,600
where you are sitting.

210
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,900
Imagine.

211
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,600
'Since 1975,'

212
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,500
I have been part of a Syrian plot

213
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:19,700
to overthrow both Comrade Saddam
and al-Bakr.

214
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,400
When we, the conspirators,

215
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:30,600
realised...that al-Bakr was to
step down in favour of his deputy,

216
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:34,800
the assumption of the presidency
by Comrade Saddam Hussein

217
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,300
forced us to put into action a plan
to remove him.

218
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:45,100
But as we did so,
we revealed ourselves

219
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,100
and our plans were uncovered.

220
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,700
MURMURING

221
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:58,800
Comrades, you can imagine
how stunned I was

222
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,700
to discover that I had been betrayed
by my closest colleagues.

223
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,200
When the first of the criminals
were arrested,

224
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:10,100
I asked them,

225
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:14,300
what political differences
are there between you and me?

226
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,900
Did you lack any power or money?

227
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:23,300
And if your opinion differed...
on anything,

228
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,800
why didn't you bring it
to the party?

229
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:31,800
They had...nothing to say
to defend themselves.

230
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:39,500
The people whose names are read out
should leave the hall.

231
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,000
Mohammed Ayesh.

232
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,300
Fouad Abdullah.

233
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,400
Amjid Haish.

234
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,900
HE CONTINUES READING NAMES

235
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:00,300
We have done nothing!
We have done nothing!

236
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,900
We are innocent.

237
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,300
We are innocent. This is all lies.

238
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,500
Go out!

239
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,900
I am innocent. Out!

240
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:12,500
Long live Saddam! God save Saddam!

241
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,300
CHEERING

242
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:17,300
Long live Saddam! Long live Saddam!

243
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,900
Mashhadi?

244
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,100
Fire.

245
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,400
Fire.

246
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,400
Fire.

247
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,400
Fire.

248
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,500
GUNSHOT
Fire!

249
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,100
My President,

250
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,700
I came as soon as I got
your message.

251
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,300
Is there something wrong?

252
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:01,600
Hamdani.

253
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,700
Forgive me.

254
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,100
You are always my friend.

255
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,400
I have nothing to forgive you for.

256
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,400
Mama?

257
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,700
Habibti, what is it?

258
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,200
Baba says he'll see you now.

259
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:49,400
Is it true that I am promised
to Mohammed?

260
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,800
Is it true? Mohammed is a good boy.

261
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:57,400
And when the time comes,
you must be a good daughter.

262
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,800
A good wife.

263
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,200
It's what your grandmother
Subha wants.

264
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,700
He was your friend, Saddam.

265
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,500
His wife was my friend.

266
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,200
How am I supposed to face her?

267
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,200
What am I supposed to tell her?

268
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,800
I did...

269
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,400
..what was necessary.

270
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:57,000
The man who can sacrifice
even his best friend

271
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,500
is the man without weakness.

272
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:07,100
In the eyes of my enemies...
I am stronger now.

273
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,400
MAN LAUGHS

274
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:28,700
Don't speak
unless you're spoken to.

275
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:31,200
Be respectful, and just listen.
Understand?

276
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,200
Yes. Hello.

277
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,400
Here come the al-Majids.

278
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,000
No women, gentlemen? No dancing?

279
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:46,200
What's the matter with you? You
should be making the most of life.
Tomorrow we could all be dead.

280
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,700
You're a funny man, Ali.

281
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:50,400
HE LAUGHS
Take a seat, Hussein.

282
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,500
So who saw it coming?

283
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,000
Hamdani?

284
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,800
Saddam.

285
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:02,600
You didn't know?

286
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:08,400
Did he tell you why? Only Saddam
knows what Saddam is thinking.

287
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,800
Only Saddam knows
what we're all thinking.

288
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:19,700
You believe that? If Saddam believes
it, that's all that matters.

289
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,500
Maybe he had a big mouth.

290
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,400
Maybe he couldn't handle his whisky.
The two don't mix.

291
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,200
Cousin, I'm simply talking,

292
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,700
amongst friends, amongst family.

293
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:32,400
Hamdani wasn't family. Be careful.

294
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,100
Nor am I.

295
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,500
Yeah, but you're a Christian,
Tariq. You're a threat
to no-one but yourself.

296
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,700
Hamdani was too clever
for his own good.

297
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:43,500
He's the past.

298
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:48,100
Tonight my friends, I'm getting
drunk, I'm getting laid,

299
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,000
and in the morning,
I won't remember a thing

300
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,400
except my loyalty
to our President.

301
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:56,400
Who is neither al-Majid
nor Ibrahim, but half and half.

302
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Go fuck a donkey. Go.

303
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,300
HE LAUGHS

304
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:20,100
I can't do this.

305
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:45,500
SOBBING

306
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:57,700
I loved him like a brother.

307
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:12,900
Hamdani, he and I spoke many times,
so many times...

308
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:17,500
about how we would put the nation
before our own needs.

309
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,400
Did he ever talk like that to you?

310
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,600
Yes.

311
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,100
Always.

312
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,800
So I know in my heart...

313
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:42,300
..that he would have understood,

314
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:47,100
that in my place,
he would have done the same.

315
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,900
What is good for Iraq...

316
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,000
is good for me.

317
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,400
He believed in you, Saddam.

318
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,200
He followed you in all things.

319
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,600
And so do I.

320
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,300
Tell me...

321
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:18,600
what I and my children...

322
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:22,400
can do to serve you and Iraq.

323
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,400
PEOPLE CHANT: Saddam! Saddam!
Saddam! Saddam!

324
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,000
HE SINGS:

325
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23,200
Why can't we go somewhere
where there are bigger animals?

326
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,400
I'm tired of shooting little birds.

327
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,200
You hear that, Saddam? Your boy
wants to shoot something bigger.

328
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,900
If Qusay was here,
I could shoot him.

329
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,000
One day you'll shoot a lion, Uday.

330
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,700
This is the middle of nowhere.

331
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,300
Tikrit is not the middle of nowhere.
Come. There's nothing here.

332
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,300
Mr President.

333
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,300
OK... You see?

334
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,300
He's yours.

335
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:56,700
Aim carefully.

336
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,300
Good.

337
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,800
His name is Khomeini.

338
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:05,100
GUNSHOT

339
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,300
LAUGHTER

340
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,100
Bastard.

341
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,900
Never mind. Never mind.

342
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:17,500
When I was a boy, if I missed,
it meant empty bellies for my family.

343
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:19,300
And a beating from my stepfather.

344
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:21,500
Come.

345
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:23,300
He was a bastard.

346
00:27:34,400 --> 00:27:37,900
I don't know why we have to come
back to this godforsaken place.

347
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:39,900
It's home.

348
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,300
Be careful with that.

349
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:45,700
And this thing with the tent.

350
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,600
The entire wealth of the country
is ours, and what do we do?

351
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:50,900
We put up a tent!

352
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:54,300
HE LAUGHS
It's true, Adnan.

353
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:57,800
INSECT BUZZES

354
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,800
What's wrong
with going to London or Paris?

355
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,100
Make him happy, Sajida.

356
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,900
If Saddam's happy,
then it will be easier for me.

357
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,900
What do you mean?

358
00:28:10,900 --> 00:28:13,400
I don't want him to rush into war.

359
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,400
He has his sights set on Khomeini.

360
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:18,300
Then speak plainly.

361
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:23,100
As long as my sister
is on my side, I will.

362
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:26,900
Adnan, he loves you.

363
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:28,700
You are practically his brother.

364
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,300
We took him in,

365
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,400
we fed him,
we all grew up together.

366
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,200
He will listen to you.
He is President.

367
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,200
He will listen.

368
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:48,100
Be good to Subha.

369
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:51,300
It's hard to believe
but she still has influence.

370
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,200
Look at her.

371
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:59,100
She doesn't like the way I dress,
can you believe it?

372
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,900
HE CHUCKLES

373
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:04,300
Shh.
HE LAUGHS

374
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,500
Look around you, Uday.

375
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,500
Look around.
The land between two rivers.

376
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:22,200
The first great armies and empires
were founded here.

377
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,500
Do you know the first laws
were written here?

378
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,500
We have the birthplace
of civilisation beneath our feet

379
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,300
and we will make it great again,
you and I.

380
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:38,300
We are lucky men, Uday.

381
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:41,800
We have a land to die for.

382
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,800
Baba. Mm? I'm hot.

383
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,000
Have you heard a word I've said?

384
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,400
You are your mother's son.

385
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,600
Of course you're hot,

386
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,500
we are in the desert.

387
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,000
Drink some water.

388
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,500
We are hunters.

389
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:13,300
HE MUTTERS
Come.

390
00:30:14,900 --> 00:30:17,000
Next time maybe I'll bring Qusay.

391
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:32,500
WOMAN:

392
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,900
He did well.

393
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,900
Your mother wants to talk to you.
She's inside.

394
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,400
Isn't that Tariq?

395
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:16,500
What does he want?

396
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,100
I'll be with her as soon as I can.
Tell her.

397
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:23,200
Barzan is already
interrogating him.

398
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,400
An agent of Iran?

399
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,000
No doubt. Son of a dog.

400
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,700
And in the south, Mohammed Bakr
al-Sadr and his Dawa Party

401
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:35,400
have now pledged
open allegiance to Khomeini.

402
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:40,600
Treason. I have my army units
at the ready, in case of uprising.

403
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,100
Iraq's army.

404
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:43,700
Of course.

405
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:49,600
Mohammed Bakr al-Sadr is one man.
It is Khomeini who is the problem.

406
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,400
Khomeini is a cause.

407
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:58,500
I struggle to see any option
but military.

408
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,000
We don't want to appear weak,

409
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,500
but would it be an idea
to seek the views of our allies,

410
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:05,600
both Arab and Western?

411
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:09,600
If there is to be war,
they will benefit,
so why shouldn't they contribute?

412
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:12,400
And they would like to protect
their supply of oil.

413
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:17,800
Of course. Access to information
from American satellites
would be a great advantage.

414
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:20,200
Providing we know our objective.

415
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:24,000
Our objective is to cut off
the head of the snake.

416
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,500
Excuse me.

417
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,900
So it's war.

418
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:38,100
I don't understand.

419
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:42,900
You're holding counsel without
the people that really matter -
the Ibrahims.

420
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,100
Mama, we are hunting. And talking.

421
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:48,400
Where's Barzan?
Where's Sabawi? Watban?

422
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,200
They are busy. They should be here.

423
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,000
Ali Hassan al-Majid is here.

424
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:56,400
He brings his cousin, Hussein.

425
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,900
Who is also my cousin. Mama, what
do you want, in the name of Allah?

426
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:02,000
They are eager
to show their loyalty.

427
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,000
They are eager
to make their fortunes.

428
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:07,000
It is your brothers
that should be always here

429
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,500
beside you at the counsel.
Half-brothers.

430
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:12,500
And your elder son

431
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:15,300
has the grace of a pig.

432
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,600
And your wife allows it.

433
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,900
All the way here,
he did nothing but break wind.

434
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,400
Uday is a boy, Mama.

435
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:27,200
What should I do, beat him?
Like Barzan's father did to me?

436
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:30,000
Drive him away from his home?

437
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,300
You have too much to say
to your mother.

438
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,000
Leave me.

439
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,500
I'm tired.

440
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:53,000
WOMAN:

441
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,700
GUNSHOT

442
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:19,200
MACHINE-GUN FIRE

443
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,800
SINGLE GUNSHOT

444
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,600
And cut!

445
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,500
MAN: And cut.

446
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,900
Very good. Impressive.
Is that what it was really like?

447
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:41,500
Well, in reality, the bullet hurt.

448
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,000
The film will cover
the early life of our President,

449
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:48,400
when he was fighting for
a free Iraq. It's for the people,

450
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,600
for the purposes of morale.

451
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:53,600
Saddam! What an honour.

452
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,600
You did well. Thank you.

453
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,800
These gentlemen
are from Time magazine.

454
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,200
Saddam Kamel.

455
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:08,900
Remarkable resemblance, don't
you think? You're cousins, right?

456
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,200
That is correct.

457
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:12,200
Saddam Kamel is my brother.

458
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:15,500
And you're Saddam
and you're Hussein?

459
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,200
We have a lot to live up to.

460
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,800
Unbelievable.

461
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,500
We want to have good relations
with the US.

462
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:26,500
We want people in America
to understand

463
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,800
what has happened inside Iraq.

464
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,900
And is there opposition to the war

465
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,600
from the Shia in your own country,
Mr President?

466
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,000
Ask the people directly.
Go into their homes.

467
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:38,900
See their love for their country.

468
00:36:38,900 --> 00:36:40,600
And for their President.

469
00:36:40,700 --> 00:36:44,200
No-one forces them to put pictures
of Saddam Hussein on their walls.

470
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,400
Still they choose to do that.

471
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:50,000
Is it true that the war
is going to bankrupt the economy?

472
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,700
These stories are lies.

473
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,800
Speak to the people.

474
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,200
Ask them if they want for anything.

475
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,400
And what of the reports
of Iran's military success

476
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:05,100
forcing Iraqi troops
back to the borders?

477
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:09,700
Recently Iran has been receiving
foreign assistance.

478
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:13,100
But what about...?
As a country of principle,

479
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:16,500
we are fighting
a man of superficiality.

480
00:37:18,300 --> 00:37:22,200
Principle will be the victim.
Do you think that the...?

481
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,900
Gentlemen, we have
something special to show you.

482
00:37:25,900 --> 00:37:30,400
ALL:

483
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,300
Excellent.

484
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,800
You have worked very hard.

485
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,900
The children enjoy it very much.

486
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,500
Tell me...

487
00:37:54,500 --> 00:38:00,000
how many of you have fathers
or brothers in the army?

488
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,500
Oh!

489
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,800
Good. You should be proud.

490
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,800
This girl looks like
my own daughter, Hala.

491
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,700
She is very pretty.

492
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:16,800
Tell me, when you are at home
with Baba and Mama,

493
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,800
what does Baba say about Saddam?

494
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,400
Anything at all?

495
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:31,500
Baba says, long live Saddam.

496
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,500
Beautiful. Thank you.

497
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:38,600
HE LAUGHS

498
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,000
Please...

499
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,500
Slow down.

500
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:48,500
I hope you have enjoyed your visit
as much as I have.

501
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:57,600
It would be wonderful
if you could visit us again soon.

502
00:38:57,600 --> 00:39:02,300
I would like that.
I will arrange it.

503
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,800
Hussein is a good boy,
a good soldier.

504
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:21,100
He'd never let you down.
He's loyal.

505
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:25,000
Yes. I like him. I'm pleased...
for the family.

506
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,400
Kamel Hanna. Yes, Your Excellency.

507
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,800
Ask the lady to join us. Yes.

508
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,100
Hussein, stand on your head.

509
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:39,200
For the President.

510
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:44,900
HE LAUGHS
He would do it!

511
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,600
For you, he would do anything.

512
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,400
Is that her?

513
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:55,300
She is pretty.

514
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,900
She is married. So what?

515
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,100
Mr President, we are honoured.

516
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,600
And I'm honoured
you're honoured. Please...

517
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,700
You look beautiful.

518
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,300
Sit here, next to me.

519
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,500
Thank you.

520
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:26,200
And may I just...

521
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,900
..so I can see you.

522
00:40:31,600 --> 00:40:33,200
And I you.

523
00:40:33,200 --> 00:40:36,600
Thank you for coming.

524
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,300
We are honoured.

525
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,900
Yes, you said.

526
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:54,900
May I say that your wife
is very beautiful.

527
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:58,000
You must love her very much. I do.

528
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,400
I think our President...

529
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,000
likes her.

530
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,800
She's my wife.

531
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:09,700
..Beautiful.

532
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,700
I'd really do nothing,
if I were you.

533
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:18,200
There will be compensation.

534
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,700
Why am I reading of Iranian
successes on the battlefield?

535
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,600
You would have been informed.

536
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:45,300
What else has been hidden from me?

537
00:41:47,300 --> 00:41:49,600
Were you hiding it from me, Barzan?

538
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,100
No! No. A report has been prepared.

539
00:41:52,100 --> 00:41:55,700
Why did we fail at Al-Muhammarah?

540
00:41:55,700 --> 00:42:00,300
We were taking too many casualties,
and a withdrawal was ordered.

541
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,900
So our soldiers refused
to die for their country?

542
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:05,500
It was becoming a massacre,
Mr President.

543
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:10,100
It was a tactical decision
to fall back and regroup.

544
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:13,200
It was a coward's decision,
General Khairallah.

545
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:19,500
I want Colonel Ahmed al-Dulaimi
and General Jawad Shiatna executed.

546
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,300
They are two of our best.

547
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:23,300
Their decision was purely tactical.

548
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,900
HE BANGS TABLE

549
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:28,000
The Iraqi Army

550
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,600
does not retreat!

551
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:32,500
Do you understand?

552
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:34,600
Barzan...

553
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:40,600
summon the commanders in question and
oversee their execution, immediately.

554
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:44,800
Hussein, come with me.
Stand for the President!

555
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:00,100
Hussein is like Saddam's
Siamese fucking twin.

556
00:43:00,100 --> 00:43:03,100
He's doing his job, Barzan,
nothing more.

557
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,900
Yeah. He's doing something.

558
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,100
How is she?

559
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,300
Barzan's with her.

560
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,700
She's very weak.

561
00:43:52,900 --> 00:43:57,300
Mama...
LABOURED BREATHING

562
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,600
Barzan, leave us.

563
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,800
I want to talk to Saddam.

564
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:13,600
Your strength

565
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:16,100
is in the family.

566
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:18,800
Blood is permanent.

567
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:21,900
I want Raghad

568
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,100
to marry Barzan's boy.

569
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,000
I want you to keep
the family together,

570
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:29,900
my family.

571
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,200
Mama, why are you talking like this?

572
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:36,000
Keep Barzan close.

573
00:44:37,700 --> 00:44:43,500
He was always loyal to you,
even when he was little.

574
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,400
You should...

575
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,500
You should rest, Mama.

576
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,100
Yes.

577
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:53,100
It is a good thing

578
00:44:53,100 --> 00:44:56,300
that you never knew your father.

579
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:04,600
He was bad blood.

You...

585
00:45:32,900 --> 00:45:35,100
gave me nothing.

LOW CHANTING

587
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,600

00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,500
and of our strength as a family.

589
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:28,100
As I am.

590
00:46:28,100 --> 00:46:31,400
You should know, Barzan,

591
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,300
it was her wish before she died,

592
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,300
that Raghad should marry Hussein.

593
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:38,900
No!

594
00:46:38,900 --> 00:46:42,900
to my son Mohammed for years.

595
00:46:44,900 --> 00:46:47,500
It was her wish. No.

596
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,400
She thought it was time
to recognise my father's family.

597
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:55,600
She said that?

598
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,200
Saddam, I've been loyal to you,
always, and now this insult,

599
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:09,300
not just to me
but to all the Ibrahims.

600
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:13,000
Please...

601
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,900
think of my honour.

602
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:54,700
Hussein, the driver of this truck
is to be arrested.

603
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,900
Those coffins should be covered.

604
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,400
Mothers and wives do not need
to be reminded of their sacrifice.

605
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,400
Everything in the city
is to be normal.

606
00:48:06,900 --> 00:48:10,800
Shouldn't we also be thinking
of other towns and cities?

607
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,000
Our soldiers come from all over.

608
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:17,800
What about the wives and mothers
of Mosul, Basra, Dujail?

609
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,300
Victory will heal everything.

610
00:48:20,300 --> 00:48:22,500
Yes, victory
will bring rewards for all.

611
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:24,600
These places belong to the Shia.

612
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,200
You have to go to them.

613
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:31,800
Let them see you. The war is
casting a shadow only you can lift.

They tried to kill me.

Hussein, how many rounds of
ammunition were fired at my cars?

644

My estimate is in excess of 300.

300 rounds.

646

One bullet.

648

Yet these traitors were given
300 opportunities to kill me.

Yes, and they will be found
and punished.

Some might say you have the most

00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:23,900
I will find the traitors.

657
00:52:23,900 --> 00:52:25,400
I promise.

658
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,100
RUMBLING

659
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,100
ENGINE HUMS

660
00:52:40,100 --> 00:52:41,700
SCREAMING

661
00:52:42,600 --> 00:52:47,600
Tear it all down! Everything!
I want everything destroyed!

662
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,400
Every house, every brick!

663
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:57,200
Everything destroyed! Crushed!

664
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:03,600
Leave nothing standing.
Get rid of it all!

665
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:08,000
Separate the men from the women.

666
00:53:45,600 --> 00:53:46,600
Beautiful.

667
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:52,200
You look simply beautiful.

668
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:59,600
Paris is beautiful.

669
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:04,300
Who's the blonde?

670
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:06,100
Just some friend of Tariq's.

671
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,300
Barzan.

672
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:25,900
You look worried.

673
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,200
He couldn't find a donkey.

674
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:35,900
HE LAUGHS

675
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:38,800
That's a good one.

676
00:54:38,800 --> 00:54:44,700
I want you to know, I would only
trust the happiness of my daughter

677
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,100
to a man who owes me everything.

678
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,200
Hussein is such a man.

679
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,800
He will be a good husband.

680
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:55,200
OK, habibti?

681
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,700
DOOR OPENS

682
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:03,100
Mr President, I have things
that need to be said.

683
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:12,700
It is done. I have carried out
your orders to the letter.

684
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,300
Dujail has gone.

685
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,100
And it's my wedding gift to you.

686
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:21,500
Raghad, please...

687
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:34,400
The traitors, their families,
their associates - all gone.

688
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,500
I know.
I'm ready to serve my President,

689
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,000
my brother.

690
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:47,200
From now on, Barzan, Hussein will be
responsible for my personal security.

691
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:53,400
He will be my son. I trust him.

692
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:56,400
We will talk more later.

693
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,900
No.

694
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:00,400
Why are you insulting me this way?

695
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:02,800
I have been loyal to you.

696
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:05,000
I have done everything
that you ask of me.

697
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,200
I even accepted this wedding.

698
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:12,700
Saddam, by continuing
to favour the al-Majids

699
00:56:12,700 --> 00:56:15,500
you are surrounding yourself
with weakness.

700
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,500
They are not interested in Iraq.

701
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:22,300
Know your place, Barzan.

702
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:26,100
They are my blood. You understand?

703
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:31,100
And I know a traitor
before he knows himself.

704
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:35,100
I have given you my soul.

705
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:45,600
You will attend the wedding,
and then you will leave Iraq.

706
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:53,700
PEOPLE ULULATE

707
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:06,500
APPLAUSE

708
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:11,300
HE YELLS

709
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,900
Now, watch this, Qusay.

710
00:58:00,800 --> 00:58:02,200
Cool, eh?
