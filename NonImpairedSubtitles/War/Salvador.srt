1
00:02:00,404 --> 00:02:02,324
Since the Nicaraguan revolution...

2
00:02:03,284 --> 00:02:07,124
...chaos has descended on tiny
El Salvador, in Central America.

3
00:02:07,124 --> 00:02:10,005
Today, 18 people were
killed and 36 wounded...

4
00:02:10,005 --> 00:02:13,834
...in a gun battle between
demonstrators and the national police.

5
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:18,634
It started when students, workers and
peasants linked to the guerillas...

6
00:02:19,605 --> 00:02:23,445
...occupied foreign embassies
and took over the National Cathedral.

7
00:02:23,445 --> 00:02:27,285
So far, in two months, more than
3000 people have disappeared.

8
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:31,126
The government blames the murders
on left-wing Marxist terrorists...

9
00:02:31,126 --> 00:02:34,966
...while left-wing spokesmen
point to the right-wing death squads.

10
00:02:34,966 --> 00:02:36,886
You cannot walk in like this!

11
00:02:36,886 --> 00:02:39,766
Good morning.
You got some money for me?

12
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:42,646
- No, I have no money.
- I want you out of here, okay?

13
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:44,566
- We cannot go out!
- I want you out!

14
00:02:44,566 --> 00:02:47,447
Look, I put up with
this shit every month.

15
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:49,367
I want you, your crumb-snatcher...

16
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:52,247
...and your war hero, or
whatever the fuck he is...

17
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:54,167
...I want him out of here!

18
00:02:54,167 --> 00:02:57,997
Fuck your husband! You got no bucks...
No bucks, no Buck Rogers, Boyle!

19
00:02:58,967 --> 00:03:00,887
Wait until I've had my coffee, huh?

20
00:03:00,887 --> 00:03:03,767
- You're disturbing my kid.
- Better get your bitch!

21
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:07,597
Shit on your papers!

22
00:03:15,288 --> 00:03:18,168
Good morning.

23
00:03:18,168 --> 00:03:20,088
I've had it!

24
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:22,968
I cannot live like this no more!

25
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:24,889
Nancy, it's Richard.
Listen...

26
00:03:24,889 --> 00:03:26,809
- Richard who?
- Boyle.

27
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:28,729
- Oh.
- Richard Boyle, yeah.

28
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:31,609
I think El Salvador's
gonna blow real soon.

29
00:03:31,609 --> 00:03:34,489
With a new press card and two grand
I can get some good stuff.

30
00:03:34,489 --> 00:03:36,409
- No way.
- Okay.

31
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:38,329
- How about a new press card?
- Forget it.

32
00:03:38,329 --> 00:03:41,209
- Come on, Nancy, please!
- I gotta go.

33
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:45,050
We've had it with you. We gave
you $2500 on that Lebanon gig.

34
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:48,879
- You fucked it away in Greece.
- I can't take Muslim nightlife, okay?

35
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,770
You lose tickets, passports,
you drink...

36
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:54,650
...and you're an embarrassment,
Boyle.

37
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,610
I get the piece, don't I?

38
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,490
How about the IRA, "Tortured
by the Brits in Belfast"?

39
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,370
And how about Cambodia,
"The Last Man Out"?

40
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:04,251
Sidney Schamburg was having
cocktails at the Plaza...

41
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:06,171
...and I was getting my ass kicked.

42
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:10,000
How about freezing my nuts off
in the Khyber Pass? I got giardia.

43
00:04:10,971 --> 00:04:14,811
- I was stapled to the toilet for weeks.
- Remember El Salvador?

44
00:04:14,811 --> 00:04:17,691
How about El Salvador?
Didn't I call that one?

45
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:19,611
- Huh, Nancy? Come on.
- Bye.

46
00:04:19,611 --> 00:04:23,452
- Hey, come on.
- Get the fuck out of here, will you?

47
00:04:23,452 --> 00:04:25,372
Not you, Nancy. Nancy?
I'm sorry. Nancy?

48
00:04:25,372 --> 00:04:27,292
Nice work, you piece of...

49
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:30,172
Larry, I need another favor.

50
00:04:30,172 --> 00:04:33,052
I gotta be at the airport
in an hour for Beirut.

51
00:04:33,052 --> 00:04:34,972
This is serious. For old times' sake.

52
00:04:34,972 --> 00:04:37,852
You gotta give me $500 to go
to El Salvador, $400...

53
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:39,773
They'll kill you
if you go back there.

54
00:04:39,773 --> 00:04:41,693
I need money, not a lecture.

55
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:44,573
Okay, $300. l'll meet you
at Pan Am in 40 minutes.

56
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:45,533
Great.

57
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:49,362
Take the quarter.
Such a fucking hurry.

58
00:04:58,013 --> 00:04:58,974
Shit.

59
00:04:58,974 --> 00:05:01,854
Mr. Boyle, your license
has been revoked.

60
00:05:01,854 --> 00:05:05,694
You're driving without a license,
registration or insurance.

61
00:05:05,694 --> 00:05:09,534
You've got four outstanding speeding
tickets, all gone to warrant.

62
00:05:09,534 --> 00:05:12,414
You've got 43 unpaid parking tickets.

63
00:05:12,414 --> 00:05:15,294
- Jesus.
- Nothing is legal about your car.

64
00:05:15,294 --> 00:05:18,175
- Even your press card is out-of-date.
- Out-of-date?

65
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:20,095
- Damn.
- I'm taking you in.

66
00:05:20,095 --> 00:05:23,935
No... Oh, I'm not that Richard Boyle.

67
00:05:23,935 --> 00:05:25,855
This happens all the time.

68
00:05:25,855 --> 00:05:28,735
- There's another Richard...
- Give me your other hand.

69
00:05:28,735 --> 00:05:32,565
Have some humanity, officer.
I just...

70
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:36,416
You, come here. You, come on.

71
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,296
Back up.

72
00:05:39,296 --> 00:05:43,136
- Thanks for getting me out.
- Come on and get your car.

73
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:46,016
Look, they got Bagel.
The Nazis busted Bagel.

74
00:05:46,016 --> 00:05:47,936
They're gonna gas him. Get your car.

75
00:05:47,936 --> 00:05:50,816
I don't have my car, Doc,
I need $75 to get it out.

76
00:05:50,816 --> 00:05:54,657
Shit, I just paid $125
to get you out!

77
00:05:54,657 --> 00:05:55,617
Stop whining.

78
00:05:55,617 --> 00:05:57,537
- Here, this is all I got.
- Thank you.

79
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:59,457
Come on before they
drop the pellet.

80
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:01,377
It's just a fucking dog.

81
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:05,207
It's my dog!

82
00:06:06,177 --> 00:06:08,097
Faster, Richie, will you?

83
00:06:08,097 --> 00:06:10,977
I don't even have a license.
They'll throw away the key.

84
00:06:10,977 --> 00:06:13,858
- How long has he been there?
- I don't know.

85
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:15,778
I left him with shit friends.

86
00:06:15,778 --> 00:06:18,658
They're not gonna gas
the poor dog, okay?

87
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:22,498
Everything's turned to shit,
Miriam's thrown me out, man.

88
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:24,418
She says I'm too old
to be a disc jockey.

89
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:28,258
She wants me to sell computers in
Silicon Valley, you believe that?

90
00:06:28,258 --> 00:06:30,178
I can't take these yuppie women.

91
00:06:30,178 --> 00:06:33,059
With the Walkmans and
the running shoes...

92
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,939
...and the "rather go to aerobics
than fuck," forget about it.

93
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:37,859
They got pussy exercises too.

94
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:40,739
Latin women, they're
totally different.

95
00:06:40,739 --> 00:06:42,659
They're kind and understanding.

96
00:06:42,659 --> 00:06:45,539
Look at Claudia. She doesn't
give a shit what I do...

97
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,499
- Yeah.
- Primo.

98
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:49,379
Best thing about them is
they don't speak English.

99
00:06:49,379 --> 00:06:52,260
Richie, can I crash at
your place tonight?

100
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,089
I got no place to go. I'll sleep in
the shower, toilet, doesn't matter.

101
00:06:57,060 --> 00:07:00,900
Light up another joint, Doc.
I got some bad news.

102
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,860
- I don't got a place.
- Huh?

103
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,700
We're evicted. We were gonna
stay with you and... Bosco.

104
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,660
- Bagel?
- Bagel.

105
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:10,501
You mean I gave you my last $200
and I got no place to stay?

106
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:11,461
- Hey, Doc...
- That's great.

107
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:14,341
Now what am I supposed to do?
I'm in deep shit.

108
00:07:14,341 --> 00:07:17,221
Man, I should've just
left you in jail.

109
00:07:17,221 --> 00:07:19,141
Move over, move over!

110
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:22,021
Another yuppie
in a fucking Oldsmobile.

111
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:24,901
This town is full of goddamn yuppies.

112
00:07:24,901 --> 00:07:28,731
Yuppie town!

113
00:07:32,582 --> 00:07:34,502
Bagel!

114
00:07:34,502 --> 00:07:36,422
Bagel?

115
00:07:36,422 --> 00:07:37,382
Where's my dog?

116
00:07:37,382 --> 00:07:41,222
What does he look like?

117
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:45,062
- Oh, yeah, I know this dog.
- Where is he?

118
00:07:45,062 --> 00:07:46,022
- Bagel!
- Excuse me.

119
00:07:46,022 --> 00:07:48,903
Sir? Excuse me.

120
00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:50,823
No, that's not your dog.

121
00:07:50,823 --> 00:07:52,743
We had to put your dog to sleep.

122
00:07:52,743 --> 00:07:55,623
We keep the dogs around 14 days.
We kept him more.

123
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:58,503
- You put him to sleep?
- Yeah.

124
00:07:58,503 --> 00:08:00,423
When's he going to wake up?

125
00:08:00,423 --> 00:08:03,303
You killed him, didn't you?
You gassed him.

126
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:06,184
We gave him an injection.
It's much more humane...

127
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:08,104
What kind of humanity is that?

128
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:10,024
You're a murderer, you know that?

129
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:11,944
I can't believe it.

130
00:08:11,944 --> 00:08:14,824
That was my only relationship,
my best friend. Seven years.

131
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:17,704
My marriage only lasted five.

132
00:08:17,704 --> 00:08:20,584
- It's not just!
- I'm really sorry.

133
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:23,464
Would you like some puppies?

134
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:25,385
- My dog's leash.
- I'm sorry.

135
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:29,225
Doc, she can't do anything.
Now come on, okay?

136
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:33,054
All right?

137
00:08:34,985 --> 00:08:35,945
What's it say?

138
00:08:35,945 --> 00:08:39,785
"Fuck you" in Italian.

139
00:08:39,785 --> 00:08:43,615
Shit, she's gone back to Italy
to her parents, goddamn it.

140
00:08:49,386 --> 00:08:51,306
That's too bad, Richie.

141
00:08:51,306 --> 00:08:55,136
Well, at least she left the TV.

142
00:09:01,106 --> 00:09:04,947
It was a marriage made in hell.

143
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:07,827
I'm sure gonna miss my boy.

144
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:09,747
Maybe she'll be back.

145
00:09:09,747 --> 00:09:11,667
Sure.

146
00:09:11,667 --> 00:09:15,497
Who could leave all this?

147
00:09:19,347 --> 00:09:21,268
- Where we going now?
- Guatemala.

148
00:09:21,268 --> 00:09:22,228
- Where we going now?
- Guatemala.

149
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,148
Why?

150
00:09:24,148 --> 00:09:26,068
Why not?

151
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:29,908
No cops, no laws, sun, it's cheap.

152
00:09:29,908 --> 00:09:33,738
No yuppies. Great dope.

153
00:09:36,628 --> 00:09:40,469
Look at you, will you? You are like
a walking museum of the '60s.

154
00:09:40,469 --> 00:09:41,429
What the fuck are you?

155
00:09:41,429 --> 00:09:44,309
I'm a forward-thinking human being.

156
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:46,229
I know about life.
I explore things.

157
00:09:46,229 --> 00:09:48,149
Being a journalist,
you're in touch with reality.

158
00:09:48,149 --> 00:09:51,989
You come off with this journalism
bullshit all the time, you know that?

159
00:09:51,989 --> 00:09:54,869
I haven't seen one goddamn article
that you've written.

160
00:09:54,869 --> 00:09:56,789
I wrote a book.
Flower of the Dragon.

161
00:09:56,789 --> 00:09:58,710
Flower of the Dragon
was ten years ago!

162
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:00,630
It was a big exposé.

163
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:02,550
Ten years ago.
What have you written since?

164
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:05,430
What are you talking about?
I've written articles.

165
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:09,270
I have one in a newspaper
in El Salvador about guerillas.

166
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:13,110
Oh, the one in El Salvador?
I read that, my whole family read it.

167
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:16,951
Everyone saw that article, Boyle.

168
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:19,831
You said Guatemala, man,
not El Salvador.

169
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:22,711
Come on, I've never been
out of the country.

170
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:24,631
They kill people here, Boyle.

171
00:10:24,631 --> 00:10:26,551
You believe everything in the papers?

172
00:10:26,551 --> 00:10:27,511
You'll love it here.

173
00:10:27,511 --> 00:10:29,431
Give me the joint.

174
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:31,351
This is my last chance, man.
I'm serious.

175
00:10:31,351 --> 00:10:35,191
If I can get some good combat
shots for AP, I can make some money.

176
00:10:35,191 --> 00:10:39,032
- I could pay you back.
- Better pay me back.

177
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:40,952
We'll head for La Libertad...

178
00:10:40,952 --> 00:10:41,912
...the best surfing beach
in the world.

179
00:10:41,912 --> 00:10:45,752
Good times, kick back for a few
months. It'll be fantastic.

180
00:10:45,752 --> 00:10:48,632
You could live in this country
for 300 bucks a year.

181
00:10:48,632 --> 00:10:50,552
- What the fuck is this?
- Mace.

182
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:53,432
- Mace? For what?
- Wild dogs.

183
00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:57,273
Yeah, wild dogs? That's bullshit.
You've lied to me straight through.

184
00:10:57,273 --> 00:11:00,153
Want me to be honest with you?

185
00:11:00,153 --> 00:11:02,073
What are you doing with all these?

186
00:11:02,073 --> 00:11:04,953
- Here you could have a life.
- What are all these?

187
00:11:04,953 --> 00:11:06,873
They come in handy.

188
00:11:06,873 --> 00:11:08,793
You're gonna love it here, Doc.

189
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,673
- I'm going home, man.
- You can drive drunk...

190
00:11:11,673 --> 00:11:14,554
...and get anybody killed for $50.
- I don't want to.

191
00:11:14,554 --> 00:11:18,394
The best pussy in the world.

192
00:11:18,394 --> 00:11:22,223
Where else can you get a virgin
to sit on your face for seven bucks?

193
00:11:23,194 --> 00:11:26,074
Seven bucks.

194
00:11:26,074 --> 00:11:28,954
It better be the best pussy
in the world...

195
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:31,835
...or I'm going home.
- Two virgins for 12.

196
00:11:31,835 --> 00:11:34,715
You're just lucky I'm fucked up,
you know that?

197
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:38,555
Drugs? No prescriptions. They got
stuff that keeps you hard all night.

198
00:11:38,555 --> 00:11:40,475
All these people want to do is fuck.

199
00:11:40,475 --> 00:11:42,395
Twelve bucks?

200
00:11:42,395 --> 00:11:44,315
I think we can get them down.

201
00:11:44,315 --> 00:11:47,195
- Now you're talking.
- You're such an asshole, Boyle.

202
00:11:47,195 --> 00:11:51,025
You're gonna love this place.

203
00:11:51,996 --> 00:11:54,876
You're gonna be in pig heaven, man.

204
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:57,756
- Why are they blocking the road?
- Don't ask.

205
00:11:57,756 --> 00:11:58,716
This ain't gringo-land.

206
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:02,556
Here, take this, be dumb,
act cool, all right?

207
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,476
Is this some kind of tranquillizer?

208
00:12:04,476 --> 00:12:06,396
Yeah, permanent one. Cyanide.

209
00:12:06,396 --> 00:12:09,277
You're gonna be sorry
when they cut off your balls...

210
00:12:09,277 --> 00:12:11,197
...and stuff one in each ear.

211
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:15,026
You're so fucking dramatic, man.
Jesus!

212
00:12:16,957 --> 00:12:18,877
Who are these clowns?

213
00:12:18,877 --> 00:12:22,707
- What the fuck?
- Traffic accident.

214
00:12:23,677 --> 00:12:27,517
Jesus, Boyle.

215
00:12:27,517 --> 00:12:31,358
- Oh God, man!
- Relax, man, it's just some guy.

216
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:35,198
Shit.

217
00:12:35,198 --> 00:12:37,118
The road to Santa Ana is closed.

218
00:12:37,118 --> 00:12:40,948
I understand, but Colonel Figueroa
told me to give a present to you boys.

219
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:48,628
They're journalists.

220
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,388
Get out of the car.

221
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,119
Whatever you do, Doc,
whatever you do...

222
00:13:01,119 --> 00:13:03,039
...don't get on the ground.

223
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:05,920
Jesus Christ, man, this is scary.

224
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,749
I can't believe this, man.

225
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,870
I'm a friend of Colonel Figueroa...

226
00:13:31,841 --> 00:13:35,681
- Friends of Figueroa.
- I'm a friend of Figueroa's.

227
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:39,511
Is that bad?

228
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:47,202
He's a friend of Figueroa's.

229
00:13:47,202 --> 00:13:51,031
Shut up!

230
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:17,923
What's going on here, man?

231
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,843
I think they're checking cédulas.

232
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:21,764
What's a cédula?

233
00:14:21,764 --> 00:14:23,684
Birth certificates, voting papers.

234
00:14:23,684 --> 00:14:27,513
If you don't have a cédula,
you're in deep shit.

235
00:14:42,885 --> 00:14:46,714
Put your hands on your head.

236
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:57,275
We've stopped a truck load
of suspicious campesinos.

237
00:15:07,846 --> 00:15:11,676
He's probably a student,
the worst thing you can be.

238
00:15:17,447 --> 00:15:19,367
Why did you leave your papers at home?

239
00:15:19,367 --> 00:15:23,196
I always leave them there.
Please, sir.

240
00:15:25,127 --> 00:15:28,957
Look, I'm a friend
of Colonel Figueroa's.

241
00:15:29,927 --> 00:15:33,757
Fucking ridiculous. I should've never
bailed you out of jail, man.

242
00:15:34,727 --> 00:15:37,608
- Who are your friends?
- Communists!

243
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:41,437
Take off your glasses.

244
00:15:45,288 --> 00:15:47,208
Oh, shit.

245
00:15:47,208 --> 00:15:51,038
Holy shit! They're gonna fucking
kill us now, Boyle.

246
00:15:52,008 --> 00:15:53,929
I thought you knew your way around.

247
00:15:53,929 --> 00:15:56,809
They're gonna kill us now,
aren't they?!

248
00:15:56,809 --> 00:15:58,729
They're gonna fucking kill us!

249
00:15:58,729 --> 00:16:01,609
Shut the fuck up! Just be cool!

250
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:05,439
I don't know what they're gonna do.

251
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:13,130
This is it.

252
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,970
This is it.

253
00:16:16,970 --> 00:16:20,799
You got any of those
tranquillizers left?

254
00:17:25,133 --> 00:17:26,093
COLONEL JULIO FIGUEROA

255
00:17:26,093 --> 00:17:28,014
Commander 3rd Brigade, Infantry
Santa Ana Garrison

256
00:17:28,014 --> 00:17:30,894
How the hell did you get in here?

257
00:17:30,894 --> 00:17:31,854
No periodistas are allowed.

258
00:17:31,854 --> 00:17:35,694
I snuck in through Guatemala, colonel.

259
00:17:35,694 --> 00:17:39,534
You're lucky you've got your huevos,
you know that?

260
00:17:39,534 --> 00:17:43,364
You look like shit.

261
00:17:44,334 --> 00:17:46,254
Come with me.

262
00:17:46,254 --> 00:17:49,135
You wash up.

263
00:17:49,135 --> 00:17:52,015
You got some drinks, some food.

264
00:17:52,015 --> 00:17:55,844
We got some nice tight pussy.

265
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:01,615
For my amigo here...

266
00:18:01,615 --> 00:18:04,495
...he write me up
in the American newspaper...

267
00:18:04,495 --> 00:18:07,376
...like the Patton of El Salvador.

268
00:18:07,376 --> 00:18:10,256
You were. It was the last
great cavalry charge in history:

269
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:14,096
Your Soccer War with Honduras, '69.

270
00:18:14,096 --> 00:18:16,016
All the way to Tegucigalpa.

271
00:18:16,016 --> 00:18:19,856
Not since Attila the Hun have there
been such amazing cavalry tactics.

272
00:18:19,856 --> 00:18:22,736
This one takes it up the culo
real nice.

273
00:18:22,736 --> 00:18:25,617
How about this one?
She take it up the culo too?

274
00:18:25,617 --> 00:18:29,457
All right.

275
00:18:29,457 --> 00:18:32,337
Libertad, Doc.
End of the rainbow.

276
00:18:32,337 --> 00:18:33,297
I'm sick.

277
00:18:33,297 --> 00:18:36,177
My asshole hurts, my dick burns...

278
00:18:36,177 --> 00:18:40,017
You know, Richie,
I don't know how to say this...

279
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:42,898
...but it's been fun
traveling with you.

280
00:18:42,898 --> 00:18:44,818
I'd like to catch a plane out.

281
00:18:44,818 --> 00:18:46,738
Do you think you're gonna die?

282
00:18:46,738 --> 00:18:48,658
I got the best doctor in town.

283
00:18:48,658 --> 00:18:52,487
You have nothing to worry about
once you get the shot.

284
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:02,099
It's a joke, it's a joke.

285
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:04,019
- What the hell's she laughing at?
- Nothing.

286
00:19:04,019 --> 00:19:06,899
Everything in there
will clean you out.

287
00:19:06,899 --> 00:19:07,859
If it doesn't, it'll kill you.

288
00:19:07,859 --> 00:19:11,699
- What about a subscription?
- All you need is an ass.

289
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:13,619
Don't pay her. I got credit here.

290
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:15,539
I gotta run.

291
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:17,459
That's a big fucking needle!

292
00:19:17,459 --> 00:19:19,379
Now, come on, please.
Just give me...

293
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:23,209
Son of a bitch!

294
00:19:46,261 --> 00:19:50,091
Ricardo! Ricardo!

295
00:19:53,941 --> 00:19:57,771
Did you miss me?
Did you miss me?

296
00:20:14,102 --> 00:20:16,983
What a pretty girl.

297
00:20:16,983 --> 00:20:20,823
They said you were dead.

298
00:20:20,823 --> 00:20:22,743
Where's her father?

299
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:26,573
Disappeared.

300
00:20:27,543 --> 00:20:30,423
Let's go to the house.

301
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:33,303
You still drunk? You still crazy?

302
00:20:33,303 --> 00:20:37,133
No, for you I stopped.
No more alcohol.

303
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:23,226
At the casa,
we'll see the television.

304
00:21:23,226 --> 00:21:26,106
I know you have another woman
in the north.

305
00:21:26,106 --> 00:21:29,936
Another woman?

306
00:22:01,628 --> 00:22:05,458
Is that you, Major Max?

307
00:22:16,029 --> 00:22:19,859
You back from the dead, man?

308
00:22:20,829 --> 00:22:24,659
I like your friend, Dr. Rock.

309
00:22:26,589 --> 00:22:28,510
How bad is it here?

310
00:22:28,510 --> 00:22:31,390
If I had one of those,
I'd be a little better off.

311
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:34,270
You gotta be good-looking and rich.

312
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:38,100
- If you have a woman you have it made.
- My ass hurts.

313
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,740
- Ricardo, can I have some?
- Yeah, go ahead, go ahead.

314
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:57,301
Yeah, yeah, Guatemala gold.

315
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:05,952
Driving down this road,
isn't it beautiful?

316
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:07,872
You want to go back home?

317
00:23:07,872 --> 00:23:09,792
Everywhere I turn...

318
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:12,672
...dogs screwing other dogs...

319
00:23:12,672 --> 00:23:16,512
...pigs in the street, it's like
Baltimore, for chrissake.

320
00:23:16,512 --> 00:23:18,432
How are we for cash?

321
00:23:18,432 --> 00:23:19,392
You hungry? Want a hamburger?

322
00:23:19,392 --> 00:23:22,272
Maybe just one before you take me
to the airport.

323
00:23:22,272 --> 00:23:25,153
I mean, I got a life there,
even without Miriam.

324
00:23:25,153 --> 00:23:28,993
I bailed you out of jail, you owe me
a lot of money over the years...

325
00:23:28,993 --> 00:23:32,822
...I wish you'd pay me so we can,
like, part company, you know?

326
00:23:38,593 --> 00:23:40,513
- John.
- Rick!

327
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:42,434
I thought I'd find you here.

328
00:23:42,434 --> 00:23:44,354
- I thought you were dead.
- Do I look that bad?

329
00:23:44,354 --> 00:23:48,194
Yes. I heard stories from Guatemala.

330
00:23:48,194 --> 00:23:50,114
They pulled your toenails out...

331
00:23:50,114 --> 00:23:52,034
Fucking Guatemala. Jesus.

332
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:55,874
- How was Beirut?
- Fucking awful.

333
00:23:55,874 --> 00:23:57,794
You gonna eat those fries?

334
00:23:57,794 --> 00:24:00,674
Dr. Rock, John Cassady.

335
00:24:00,674 --> 00:24:01,635
Thanks.

336
00:24:01,635 --> 00:24:05,464
That was a great cover
for Newsweek, John.

337
00:24:06,435 --> 00:24:09,315
What happened?
How come you split so fast?

338
00:24:09,315 --> 00:24:11,235
What, from here? I had a beef
with Major Max's boys.

339
00:24:11,235 --> 00:24:14,115
They weren't happy about the
torture chamber story.

340
00:24:14,115 --> 00:24:15,075
Waiter!

341
00:24:15,075 --> 00:24:16,995
Major Max?

342
00:24:16,995 --> 00:24:18,915
Who's Major Max?

343
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:21,796
This guy's after you too,
on top of everything else?

344
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:23,716
That was a year ago.
They don't have computers.

345
00:24:23,716 --> 00:24:26,596
- Get out of here.
- I'm getting out.

346
00:24:26,596 --> 00:24:29,476
First plane, I'm gone.
I'm not kidding this time.

347
00:24:29,476 --> 00:24:31,396
Get the fuck out of here!

348
00:24:31,396 --> 00:24:32,356
I want my money, Boyle.

349
00:24:32,356 --> 00:24:35,236
- What money?
- I want the money you owe me.

350
00:24:35,236 --> 00:24:39,077
- No bullshit!
- You're on drugs. There is no money!

351
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,957
The transmission in Guatemala,
gas, whores, the border ripoff.

352
00:24:41,957 --> 00:24:44,837
You know at the border
we had 70 colones?

353
00:24:44,837 --> 00:24:46,757
You know how many we got left? 12.

354
00:24:46,757 --> 00:24:49,637
How much is 12 colones?

355
00:24:49,637 --> 00:24:53,477
- Four bucks. Three bucks.
- Three American dollars?!

356
00:24:53,477 --> 00:24:55,397
That's all we got left?

357
00:24:55,397 --> 00:24:57,318
My dog is dead, Boyle.

358
00:24:57,318 --> 00:25:00,198
Stop doing that!
You know why he's doing that?

359
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:02,118
This is why. He drinks Tic Tack.

360
00:25:02,118 --> 00:25:04,038
It's 17 cents a bottle.

361
00:25:04,038 --> 00:25:05,958
You can't get rid of the guy.

362
00:25:05,958 --> 00:25:08,838
He'll follow you anywhere.
Want to go to Beirut?

363
00:25:08,838 --> 00:25:10,758
Tell me what it has to do with me.

364
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:12,678
It's your yuppie liberal bullshit...

365
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:15,558
It has nothing the fuck
to do with me, man!

366
00:25:15,558 --> 00:25:18,439
I'm stuck in the middle
of his fucking country, man.

367
00:25:18,439 --> 00:25:22,279
I got the shits and I only got
three fucking dollars!

368
00:25:22,279 --> 00:25:24,199
I gotta get out of here, man!

369
00:25:24,199 --> 00:25:26,119
Fuck you, Boyle. Fuck you.

370
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:28,039
Fuck you!

371
00:25:28,039 --> 00:25:30,919
Fuck you!

372
00:25:30,919 --> 00:25:34,749
He was this hitchhiker
I picked up in Guatemala.

373
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,760
Look, John, I'm really sorry...

374
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,680
It's on Newsweek.

375
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,560
You want me to be honest with you?

376
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:48,400
I got fired by PNS, okay?
And I could use a string real bad.

377
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,280
- Could you help?
- There's no work here.

378
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,161
- Nobody cares about this war.
- I care.

379
00:25:54,161 --> 00:25:56,081
They're not just shooting the Indians.

380
00:25:56,081 --> 00:25:59,921
Last week a Mexican TV guy
got blown away...

381
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:02,801
...by their paramilitary groups.

382
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:06,641
They're shooting at us.

383
00:26:06,641 --> 00:26:09,521
- Why don't you try Angola?
- It's got no nightlife.

384
00:26:09,521 --> 00:26:11,441
Hey, I can get you in with Figueroa.

385
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:14,322
I got carte blanche
with his elite unit.

386
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,242
You still got the death-mobile.

387
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:17,202
Come on, Boyle.

388
00:26:17,202 --> 00:26:19,122
Want to go out on dawn patrol?

389
00:26:19,122 --> 00:26:22,952
Or are you too big
of a media star these days?

390
00:26:25,842 --> 00:26:27,762
- Let's go.
- All right.

391
00:26:27,762 --> 00:26:29,682
EL PLAYON
Dump site for death squad victims

392
00:26:29,682 --> 00:26:33,523
You haven't looked through
a lens in a while.

393
00:26:33,523 --> 00:26:37,352
Take some pictures.
There's fresh bodies up there.

394
00:26:41,203 --> 00:26:43,123
Have you got...

395
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:46,953
...a 24 or a 28 I could use?

396
00:27:18,645 --> 00:27:22,475
You know what made photographers
like Robert Capa great, Rich?

397
00:27:23,445 --> 00:27:26,325
They weren't after money.

398
00:27:26,325 --> 00:27:30,155
They captured the nobility
of human suffering.

399
00:27:31,126 --> 00:27:33,046
That was a great shot in Spain.

400
00:27:33,046 --> 00:27:34,966
One flying through the air.

401
00:27:34,966 --> 00:27:37,846
Yeah, but it was more
than a body, Richie.

402
00:27:37,846 --> 00:27:39,766
He got...

403
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:42,646
...why they died.

404
00:27:42,646 --> 00:27:46,476
That's what Capa caught.
He caught that moment of death.

405
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,287
You're right up there with him.

406
00:27:51,287 --> 00:27:55,127
You're the best.

407
00:27:55,127 --> 00:27:57,047
You gotta get close, Rich...

408
00:27:57,047 --> 00:27:59,927
...to get the truth.

409
00:27:59,927 --> 00:28:03,757
You get too close, you die.

410
00:28:04,728 --> 00:28:06,648
Someday...

411
00:28:06,648 --> 00:28:10,477
...I want a shot like Capa.

412
00:28:12,408 --> 00:28:16,238
Someday.

413
00:28:22,008 --> 00:28:25,849
Someday.

414
00:28:25,849 --> 00:28:28,729
I gotta go, man.

415
00:28:28,729 --> 00:28:32,569
We gotta go.

416
00:28:32,569 --> 00:28:36,399
I don't have to tell you
to watch yourself, do I?

417
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:41,209
Alvarez's people are staked out
at the Cathedral, nowadays.

418
00:28:41,209 --> 00:28:43,130
l'll talk to him for you.

419
00:28:43,130 --> 00:28:45,050
And Tom Kelly's the new ambassador.

420
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,930
- From Cambodia?
- You should check him out.

421
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:49,850
I know him. He's a good man.

422
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:53,690
There's gonna be a party at the
embassy on Tuesday for the election.

423
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:55,610
John, thanks.

424
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:59,440
Cambodia was something, huh?

425
00:29:15,771 --> 00:29:17,691
RAMON ALVAREZ
Director of Human Rights Office...

426
00:29:17,691 --> 00:29:21,521
...and spokesman for the
Revolutionary Democratic Front

427
00:29:24,412 --> 00:29:28,241
MAIN CATHEDRAL
San Salvador

428
00:29:30,172 --> 00:29:32,092
What's going on here?

429
00:29:32,092 --> 00:29:35,922
This is where people find out
about the disappeared.

430
00:29:39,773 --> 00:29:43,613
- What did he say?
- These people are from a land co-op.

431
00:29:43,613 --> 00:29:45,533
They were evicted by police,
so they're on strike.

432
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:47,453
I saw that in Zapata.

433
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:50,333
Carmen!

434
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:53,213
Carmen Sanchez. Hey, it's Ricardo.

435
00:29:53,213 --> 00:29:57,043
Hi, how are you?

436
00:30:04,734 --> 00:30:07,614
Ramon?

437
00:30:07,614 --> 00:30:11,444
Did John Cassady talk to you
about my going out with the guerillas?

438
00:30:15,294 --> 00:30:19,124
Ramon, I need a break and I did a
good story on you last year, remember?

439
00:30:20,095 --> 00:30:22,015
Look, I'm not a travel agency
for you guys.

440
00:30:22,015 --> 00:30:25,845
I know, but if Max takes power, you'll
need good press. I'd like to help.

441
00:30:26,815 --> 00:30:28,735
Good press.

442
00:30:28,735 --> 00:30:29,695
There are 10,000 disappeared...

443
00:30:29,695 --> 00:30:33,535
...and every day the list grows,
and you pendejo...

444
00:30:33,535 --> 00:30:37,365
...talk about good press.

445
00:30:39,296 --> 00:30:41,216
Ramon...

446
00:30:41,216 --> 00:30:44,096
...I got some shots this morning
and maybe they can help you...

447
00:30:44,096 --> 00:30:47,926
...from El Playon. I'm sorry, okay?

448
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:54,657
To the mountains?

449
00:30:54,657 --> 00:30:56,577
Come back next week. I arrange it.

450
00:30:56,577 --> 00:31:00,406
Oh, God. Thank you, Carmen.

451
00:31:05,217 --> 00:31:06,177
Sister Stan?

452
00:31:06,177 --> 00:31:09,057
- Hi, how you doing?
- Oh, fine.

453
00:31:09,057 --> 00:31:10,977
- It's good to see you back.
- Good to see you.

454
00:31:10,977 --> 00:31:12,898
Cathy's around somewhere.

455
00:31:12,898 --> 00:31:14,818
You look awfully busy.

456
00:31:14,818 --> 00:31:17,698
Yes. Parents missing, dead, lost.

457
00:31:17,698 --> 00:31:21,538
These are some survivors from
the massacre at the Sempa River.

458
00:31:21,538 --> 00:31:24,418
I heard government helicopters
fired as they crossed.

459
00:31:24,418 --> 00:31:26,338
It's very bad now. Very bad.

460
00:31:26,338 --> 00:31:27,298
It's very bad now. Very bad.

461
00:31:27,298 --> 00:31:31,128
Madness on both sides.

462
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,979
Cathy Moore.

463
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:36,899
The prettiest Colleen
in all of El Salvador.

464
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:39,779
What are you doing here,
you degenerate?

465
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:42,659
Back to see old girlfriends
at the Noa Noa?

466
00:31:42,659 --> 00:31:46,499
- You ruined that by converting them.
- I try.

467
00:31:46,499 --> 00:31:48,419
Need a ride to La Libertad tomorrow?

468
00:31:48,419 --> 00:31:52,249
I can't, I got too much to do
around here.

469
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,140
Fudge!

470
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:58,020
It's the wrong piece!
lt's for an elbow!

471
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,860
I told Cleveland!
lt happens every time! They promised.

472
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,700
Come on, Cathy. We'll have
another shipment next month.

473
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,620
Anisetta can wait.

474
00:32:07,620 --> 00:32:09,541
Can't you, darling?

475
00:32:09,541 --> 00:32:11,461
One... two...

476
00:32:11,461 --> 00:32:14,341
...three... four...

477
00:32:14,341 --> 00:32:15,301
...five.

478
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:19,131
Now you can go to any urban city
and you can make it.

479
00:32:21,061 --> 00:32:24,901
Try to halt the infiltration
into the Americas...

480
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,782
...by terrorists,
by outside interference...

481
00:32:27,782 --> 00:32:30,662
...and those who aren't
just aiming at El Salvador...

482
00:32:30,662 --> 00:32:34,502
...but I think are aiming at...

483
00:32:34,502 --> 00:32:37,382
...the whole of Central and
possibly later, South America...

484
00:32:37,382 --> 00:32:41,212
...and, I'm sure,
eventually North America.

485
00:32:59,463 --> 00:33:00,423
Can you believe that...

486
00:33:00,423 --> 00:33:04,253
...the straight man to a chimpanzee
will be the next president of the U.S.?

487
00:33:05,224 --> 00:33:07,144
I mean, doesn't that depress you?

488
00:33:07,144 --> 00:33:08,104
- Know what depresses me?
- What?

489
00:33:08,104 --> 00:33:10,984
- You!
- I can accept that.

490
00:33:10,984 --> 00:33:13,864
I can't! This is like a gig.
I'm trying to make money.

491
00:33:13,864 --> 00:33:16,744
How can I, with you
yakking and hobbling around?

492
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:20,584
Go get something to eat or go to
the pool and meet girls, will you?

493
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:22,504
- Stay out of my face!
- Okay, I'm easy.

494
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:25,385
Yakking all the time.

495
00:33:25,385 --> 00:33:29,225
...going for Ronald Reagan.

496
00:33:29,225 --> 00:33:31,145
- Morgan.
- I thought you were dead.

497
00:33:31,145 --> 00:33:34,985
What brings you here?
Reagan planning ahead?

498
00:33:34,985 --> 00:33:35,945
Colonel Hyde, remember me?

499
00:33:35,945 --> 00:33:37,865
COLONEL BENTLEY HYDE
Senior Officer MILGROUP

500
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:39,785
U.S. Advisor Salvador Military

501
00:33:39,785 --> 00:33:42,666
- Pacific News Service, Vietnam?
- Bob Samuels, USAID.

502
00:33:42,666 --> 00:33:43,626
How do you do?

503
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:46,506
Millicent Davies, US AFL-CIO.

504
00:33:46,506 --> 00:33:48,426
Remember me, sir?

505
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:49,386
Yeah, I remember.

506
00:33:49,386 --> 00:33:53,226
Last time I heard about you
was when Thieu kicked you out.

507
00:33:53,226 --> 00:33:56,106
Then Mr. Thieu
got kicked out after me.

508
00:33:56,106 --> 00:33:58,986
I never understood why you guys
like the Commies so much.

509
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:00,907
"We guys."

510
00:34:00,907 --> 00:34:04,747
If you were Vietnamese, you'd be in a
reeducation camp pulling turnips.

511
00:34:04,747 --> 00:34:06,667
I never really liked turnips very much.

512
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:09,547
And I'm not applying
for Vietnamese citizenship.

513
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:13,377
They don't like that funny stuff
you smoke, old buddy.

514
00:34:14,347 --> 00:34:15,307
Why, you got some?

515
00:34:15,307 --> 00:34:19,148
Colonel, let me ask you something.
It's a big favor.

516
00:34:19,148 --> 00:34:22,977
You think you could get me out
on a Cazadore op?

517
00:34:23,948 --> 00:34:26,828
If I get you out...

518
00:34:26,828 --> 00:34:29,708
...what's in it for me?

519
00:34:29,708 --> 00:34:31,628
These guys never change.

520
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:33,548
Vietnam. You know, Vietnam.

521
00:34:33,548 --> 00:34:36,428
I mean, are we gonna
invade here or what?

522
00:34:36,428 --> 00:34:39,309
I don't know
what you're talking about.

523
00:34:39,309 --> 00:34:40,269
I was young during all that.

524
00:34:40,269 --> 00:34:44,109
Look, I'm not supposed
to talk to the press, okay?

525
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:46,989
And you're weird. So fuck off.

526
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:48,909
I'm not the press.

527
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:51,789
JACK MORGAN
U.S. State Department Analyst

528
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:53,709
- Go with the guerillas?
- With anybody.

529
00:34:53,709 --> 00:34:57,550
The National Guard, the muchachos...
Want a drink? Yeah, you do.

530
00:34:57,550 --> 00:34:59,470
Something big is in the wind.

531
00:34:59,470 --> 00:35:02,350
Rebels are getting weapons
through Nicaragua.

532
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:06,179
They'll make a move soon, so any news
or photos you could throw my way...

533
00:35:07,150 --> 00:35:10,030
No, that's stuff's hard to prove
and I hate doing that.

534
00:35:10,030 --> 00:35:12,910
I'm not asking you to spook.
Just show them to me first.

535
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,830
You'll publish them anyway.

536
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:18,671
I hear they're getting it from the
black market, from government troops...

537
00:35:18,671 --> 00:35:21,551
Last year.
This year Castro's got them organized.

538
00:35:21,551 --> 00:35:25,391
I'm not messing around.
This is all Warsaw bloc stuff.

539
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:28,271
Jesus. Same old "Black Jack" Morgan.

540
00:35:28,271 --> 00:35:32,111
You won't think it's a joke
when they take this place.

541
00:35:32,111 --> 00:35:35,952
Nicaragua was just the beginning.
Guatemala and Honduras are next.

542
00:35:35,952 --> 00:35:38,832
In five years you'll
see Cuban tanks on the Rio Grande.

543
00:35:38,832 --> 00:35:42,661
Give me a break. I'm more worried
about Major Max on the Rio Grande.

544
00:35:43,632 --> 00:35:45,552
Major Max may be
running things here soon.

545
00:35:45,552 --> 00:35:48,432
So you'd better watch yourself, sport.

546
00:35:48,432 --> 00:35:50,352
Jesus. Hey, could you
lend me 50 bucks?

547
00:35:50,352 --> 00:35:52,272
- What?
- 50 bucks.

548
00:35:52,272 --> 00:35:54,193
Tom!

549
00:35:54,193 --> 00:35:57,073
Ambassador Kelly, how are you?
I'm Richard Boyle, PNS.

550
00:35:57,073 --> 00:35:59,953
I was the last man out of Cambodia.
After Schamburg.

551
00:35:59,953 --> 00:36:03,793
I wrote Flower of the Dragon.
I'm a friend of Captain Moore's.

552
00:36:03,793 --> 00:36:06,673
THOMAS KELLY
U.S. Ambassador to El Salvador

553
00:36:06,673 --> 00:36:09,553
Ambassador, does this Reagan thing
pose a problem for you?

554
00:36:09,553 --> 00:36:12,434
Let me grab a couple of shots.

555
00:36:12,434 --> 00:36:15,314
General, have you met Mr. Doyle?

556
00:36:15,314 --> 00:36:18,194
Hello. Nice to meet you.
That's Boyle. Boyle.

557
00:36:18,194 --> 00:36:21,074
Thanks.

558
00:36:21,074 --> 00:36:24,904
ABC has projected
the next president...

559
00:36:26,834 --> 00:36:30,664
...Ronald Reagan.

560
00:36:34,515 --> 00:36:38,355
I gotta do a standup at 10,
boiling all this down.

561
00:36:38,355 --> 00:36:40,275
You couldn't go far wrong saying:

562
00:36:40,275 --> 00:36:44,115
"With Reagan in the saddle,
the guerillas are in deep shit."

563
00:36:44,115 --> 00:36:47,955
That's lovely, Peter, but have you
seen the Journal today?

564
00:36:47,955 --> 00:36:51,796
Here. It's real rah-rah democracy,
free elections, all that.

565
00:36:51,796 --> 00:36:54,676
I think it's what
the networks want tonight.

566
00:36:54,676 --> 00:36:57,556
So, what's your sign?

567
00:36:57,556 --> 00:36:58,516
"Stop."

568
00:36:58,516 --> 00:37:00,436
That's really cute.

569
00:37:00,436 --> 00:37:02,356
I thought it was "Slippery When Wet."

570
00:37:02,356 --> 00:37:06,196
This article and you, Pauline,
are 100 percent...

571
00:37:06,196 --> 00:37:08,117
...and unequivocally full of shit.

572
00:37:08,117 --> 00:37:10,997
Who's talking? You're so
full of shit I can't believe it.

573
00:37:10,997 --> 00:37:12,917
- I resent...
- Know what I resent?

574
00:37:12,917 --> 00:37:16,757
- I resent what we saw in Santa Ana.
- What was that?

575
00:37:16,757 --> 00:37:20,597
A kid shot in the head and hung
because he didn't have his cédula.

576
00:37:20,597 --> 00:37:22,517
- Know what a cédula is?
- Yeah.

577
00:37:22,517 --> 00:37:26,358
If you're gonna analyze
a situation, analyze it right.

578
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:30,198
You don't have a cédula on
election day, stamped, you're dead.

579
00:37:30,198 --> 00:37:33,078
What kind of democracy is it
when you have to vote...

580
00:37:33,078 --> 00:37:35,958
...and if you don't you're branded
a Commie subversivo.

581
00:37:35,958 --> 00:37:38,838
These people would vote
for Donald Duck...

582
00:37:38,838 --> 00:37:41,718
...or whoever the local cop
tells them because if they don't...

583
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,638
...this is what happens.

584
00:37:43,638 --> 00:37:47,468
You're a real pro. That's why you
can't last two weeks with a network.

585
00:37:48,439 --> 00:37:52,268
Yuppies do a standup from the Camino
Real, they think they got the story.

586
00:37:53,239 --> 00:37:54,199
City lights, my ass.

587
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:57,079
"My Two Weeks in El Salvador"
by Pauline Axelrod.

588
00:37:57,079 --> 00:37:58,039
Oh, yeah.

589
00:37:58,039 --> 00:38:00,919
"Whoring Through El Salvador"
by Richard Boyle.

590
00:38:00,919 --> 00:38:03,800
Never with you,
blowjob queen of New York.

591
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,640
You're kissing all the right asses,
no wonder you're on the networks.

592
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:10,520
Excuse me.

593
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:12,440
- Pauline, I'm sorry.
- Fuck off!

594
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:16,280
Just be a sport. I'm an asshole!

595
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:19,160
I'm an asshole, all right?

596
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,040
Well, you don't have to worry
about her.

597
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,881
She's gonna boil it down real good.

598
00:38:25,881 --> 00:38:28,761
I put 500 mics of acid
in her drink.

599
00:38:28,761 --> 00:38:32,601
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

600
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:36,431
With Ronald Reagan
sweeping the elections...

601
00:38:37,401 --> 00:38:41,231
...here at the Camino Real Hotel...

602
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:56,602
Attention, residents of Escalon.

603
00:38:56,602 --> 00:38:59,482
Ronald Reagan has been
elected President.

604
00:38:59,482 --> 00:39:02,363
Finally, we have someone
in the White House with balls.

605
00:39:02,363 --> 00:39:04,283
MAJOR MAXIMILIANO CASANOVA
(aka Major Max)

606
00:39:04,283 --> 00:39:08,123
Presidential Candidate and Former
Director of Salvadoran Intelligence

607
00:39:08,123 --> 00:39:10,043
The time has come for us, brothers...

608
00:39:10,043 --> 00:39:12,923
...former members of Orden...

609
00:39:12,923 --> 00:39:16,753
...patriots of the
Maximiliano Hernandez Brigade...

610
00:39:17,723 --> 00:39:21,553
...and brothers of La Mano Blanca.

611
00:39:22,524 --> 00:39:26,353
These fucking priests poisoning
the minds of our Salvadoran youth...

612
00:39:27,324 --> 00:39:30,204
...are gonna be the first to bleed.

613
00:39:30,204 --> 00:39:34,044
They are pig shit.

614
00:39:34,044 --> 00:39:37,874
And this Romero
is the biggest pig shit of all.

615
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:42,674
A shitfaced desecration
of an archbishop.

616
00:39:43,645 --> 00:39:46,525
And with this bullet...

617
00:39:46,525 --> 00:39:50,355
...he will be the first to die.

618
00:39:51,325 --> 00:39:55,155
For every one of our people
we will kill 100 of them.

619
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:59,006
We will avenge the deaths...

620
00:39:59,006 --> 00:40:02,846
...of the South African ambassador...

621
00:40:02,846 --> 00:40:05,726
...of Foreign Minister
Mauricio Borgenovo...

622
00:40:05,726 --> 00:40:07,646
...of Roberto Cuoma...

623
00:40:07,646 --> 00:40:11,486
...of Colonel Rosario,
of Gutierrez and Molina...

624
00:40:11,486 --> 00:40:14,366
...and of the Mayor of El Paraiso.

625
00:40:14,366 --> 00:40:18,207
These subversives that have sold our
country to the Communists will die.

626
00:40:18,207 --> 00:40:22,036
Erlich, Zaun, Kelly, Duarte,
et cetera, et cetera.

627
00:40:25,887 --> 00:40:29,717
And these pseudo journalists sent
by the Zionist-Communist conspiracy...

628
00:40:30,687 --> 00:40:34,517
...to divide and confuse our people,
they will die.

629
00:40:38,368 --> 00:40:41,248
Now...

630
00:40:41,248 --> 00:40:44,128
...who will be the one...

631
00:40:44,128 --> 00:40:46,048
...among you...

632
00:40:46,048 --> 00:40:49,878
...to rid me of this Romero?

633
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:22,520
You will be famous.

634
00:41:31,171 --> 00:41:34,051
As you well know...

635
00:41:34,051 --> 00:41:35,971
...I stand for nationalism...

636
00:41:35,971 --> 00:41:38,851
...law and order,
and economic prosperity.

637
00:41:38,851 --> 00:41:40,771
More important...

638
00:41:40,771 --> 00:41:44,611
...I stand for Church and family...

639
00:41:44,611 --> 00:41:48,441
...and a peaceful Salvador.

640
00:41:50,372 --> 00:41:54,201
There you go. You like that?

641
00:41:56,132 --> 00:41:57,092
Yeah, rock 'n' roll.

642
00:41:57,092 --> 00:41:59,972
Your tab is way high.
You owe me 400 colones.

643
00:41:59,972 --> 00:42:01,892
I'm running a restaurant, not a bank.

644
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:03,812
I know, okay?

645
00:42:03,812 --> 00:42:05,732
I got an NBC radio gig in the works...

646
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:08,613
...I got a CNN feed tomorrow,
I'm hot again.

647
00:42:08,613 --> 00:42:11,493
Have I ever stiffed you in 10 years?

648
00:42:11,493 --> 00:42:14,373
l'll pay you the whole thing
next week.

649
00:42:14,373 --> 00:42:16,293
Okay. Don't tell Elena.
She'll kill me.

650
00:42:16,293 --> 00:42:20,123
Besides that, could you throw in 100
colones cash, walking around money?

651
00:42:21,093 --> 00:42:23,013
In front of Maria,
I don't want to look like a jerk.

652
00:42:23,013 --> 00:42:26,854
- You're doing it to me again.
- I'll make it 750.

653
00:42:26,854 --> 00:42:27,814
Okay, man.

654
00:42:27,814 --> 00:42:30,694
...who are the masters of deception.

655
00:42:30,694 --> 00:42:34,523
Christian Democrat green
on the outside...

656
00:42:37,414 --> 00:42:40,294
...Moscow red on the inside.

657
00:42:40,294 --> 00:42:44,124
What a clown!

658
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:47,015
Listen to your conscience.

659
00:42:47,015 --> 00:42:49,895
Who is inflicting more violence?

660
00:42:49,895 --> 00:42:53,724
Terrorists?

661
00:43:01,415 --> 00:43:04,296
Carlos, come on. Get down.

662
00:43:04,296 --> 00:43:08,125
This isn't funny. Come on.

663
00:43:10,056 --> 00:43:13,886
I want to talk to you! Sit down.

664
00:43:24,457 --> 00:43:28,286
It's getting dangerous here.

665
00:43:29,257 --> 00:43:32,137
Yes, we're living in a bad time.

666
00:43:32,137 --> 00:43:35,967
Like 1932 again, I detect
a bad feeling in the air.

667
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,338
This stuff's like white lightening.

668
00:43:51,338 --> 00:43:55,178
You keep drinking that, you'll
end up in the street begging.

669
00:43:55,178 --> 00:43:59,008
I'm not kidding you, you will.

670
00:44:10,539 --> 00:44:14,369
You and your friends are really funny.

671
00:44:15,339 --> 00:44:19,180
Yes, but you'd look better
without your balls.

672
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:22,060
How 'bout I cut yours off.

673
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,940
Who are you?
Get off the fucking car.

674
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:28,770
Who are you?
Get off the fucking car.

675
00:44:31,660 --> 00:44:35,490
How about some beers for everybody?

676
00:44:38,381 --> 00:44:42,210
Get in the car, Doc.

677
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:45,101
Get in the car, Doc.

678
00:44:45,101 --> 00:44:48,931
Let's go to the beach,
I've got my pickup truck.

679
00:44:49,901 --> 00:44:53,731
Me with you? Not even to church.
Why don't you ask your mother?

680
00:44:56,622 --> 00:44:58,542
Hey! What are you doing?

681
00:44:58,542 --> 00:45:02,371
Jesus.

682
00:45:05,262 --> 00:45:07,182
Get in the car.

683
00:45:07,182 --> 00:45:11,022
Doc, get in the car.

684
00:45:11,022 --> 00:45:13,902
Where'd you get all those marks
on your face?

685
00:45:13,902 --> 00:45:17,732
Couldn't keep your hands
off the blackheads in high school?

686
00:45:19,663 --> 00:45:23,492
Could be death squad, got it?
Get in the car.

687
00:45:58,165 --> 00:46:01,994
You can drop me here.

688
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:08,725
Where are you going?

689
00:46:08,725 --> 00:46:12,566
I'm going with the guerrillas
in the mountains.

690
00:46:12,566 --> 00:46:14,486
What will your parents say?

691
00:46:14,486 --> 00:46:16,406
She knows.

692
00:46:16,406 --> 00:46:19,286
It's not safe here anymore.

693
00:46:19,286 --> 00:46:22,166
I go, okay?

694
00:46:22,166 --> 00:46:25,996
You gonna join them?

695
00:46:30,807 --> 00:46:34,636
In my country, amigo,
there is no more God.

696
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:41,367
They took Carlos and Dr. Rock!
They saw the marijuana!

697
00:46:41,367 --> 00:46:45,197
Go in the house, l'll take care of it!

698
00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:49,048
What are you talking about?
lt's my brother!

699
00:46:49,048 --> 00:46:51,928
I know it's your brother!
l'll take care of it.

700
00:46:51,928 --> 00:46:53,848
Now get in the fucking house!

701
00:46:53,848 --> 00:46:57,677
l'll take care of it!

702
00:47:03,448 --> 00:47:07,278
Fuck!

703
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,170
Get me the fuck out of here!

704
00:47:34,170 --> 00:47:37,050
You want to live? Shut up.

705
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:40,880
They're marihuanos. Subversives.

706
00:48:12,572 --> 00:48:15,452
Doc, go, go!
Get out of here. Go.

707
00:48:15,452 --> 00:48:16,412
Take him out.

708
00:48:16,412 --> 00:48:19,292
And the other one?

709
00:48:19,292 --> 00:48:21,212
No, he's a bad kid.
No respect.

710
00:48:21,212 --> 00:48:25,042
He stays here.
Or you stay as well.

711
00:48:38,493 --> 00:48:40,413
All right.

712
00:48:40,413 --> 00:48:44,243
Carlos, just stay cool.
l'll get you out.

713
00:48:55,774 --> 00:48:57,694
- Hi, Cathy, how are you?
- I'm fine.

714
00:48:57,694 --> 00:48:59,615
- You look a little tired.
- I'm fine.

715
00:48:59,615 --> 00:49:01,535
- Ambassador, Richard Boyle.
- Sir.

716
00:49:01,535 --> 00:49:03,455
Good to see you again.

717
00:49:03,455 --> 00:49:05,375
- You remember me?
- I certainly do.

718
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:09,204
I'm sorry, but I had actually written
two articles about you in Cambodia.

719
00:49:10,175 --> 00:49:11,135
- Really?
- "Fall of Phnom Penh."

720
00:49:11,135 --> 00:49:14,015
I was the last American
journalist out.

721
00:49:14,015 --> 00:49:17,855
Schamberg gets his Pulitzer Prize,
and I almost got cholera...

722
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:21,685
...but we saved 1100 refugees
from the Khmer Rouge.

723
00:49:23,616 --> 00:49:27,456
- Awful, what they did to that country.
- Yes, it was.

724
00:49:27,456 --> 00:49:31,296
Are you one of the people portraying
them as the good guys for a while?

725
00:49:31,296 --> 00:49:33,216
Yes, sir, I'm afraid
I was wrong there.

726
00:49:33,216 --> 00:49:35,136
But a lot of people were.

727
00:49:35,136 --> 00:49:38,017
If these guys running around
the hills took power...

728
00:49:38,017 --> 00:49:40,897
...it'd be much worse than Pol Pot.

729
00:49:40,897 --> 00:49:43,777
Are they as bad as Major Max
and the Mano Blanco?

730
00:49:43,777 --> 00:49:44,737
I don't know.

731
00:49:44,737 --> 00:49:48,567
A killer on the right, God knows what
on the left and a gutless middle.

732
00:49:51,457 --> 00:49:54,337
Boyle, about your problem here...

733
00:49:54,337 --> 00:49:58,178
Carol's checked the National Guard,
the Treasury Police, the Army.

734
00:49:58,178 --> 00:50:01,058
Nobody seems to know anything
about this boy.

735
00:50:01,058 --> 00:50:02,978
- Now we think...
- With all due respect...

736
00:50:02,978 --> 00:50:04,898
...they're lying.

737
00:50:04,898 --> 00:50:08,738
He didn't just disappear. Nobody
disappears here. They got him.

738
00:50:08,738 --> 00:50:11,618
Carol, have you checked Human Rights?

739
00:50:11,618 --> 00:50:15,448
Fuck the Human Rights office! They
rearranged this kid's molecules!

740
00:50:16,419 --> 00:50:19,299
- Richard!
- He's dying out there, those fucks.

741
00:50:19,299 --> 00:50:22,179
He's just a kid!
He's just a kid!

742
00:50:22,179 --> 00:50:25,059
- Richard, please calm down.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

743
00:50:25,059 --> 00:50:27,939
Ambassador, look, his sister...

744
00:50:27,939 --> 00:50:31,779
...she's my girlfriend.
I've gotta get a cédula for her.

745
00:50:31,779 --> 00:50:35,620
They could come tonight, take her away
and kill her too.

746
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:39,460
Richard! That doesn't have
anything to do with us.

747
00:50:39,460 --> 00:50:41,380
You know the laws here.

748
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:43,300
She'll have to go back
to her hometown.

749
00:50:43,300 --> 00:50:45,220
- Where's she from?
- Morazon, sir.

750
00:50:45,220 --> 00:50:49,050
If she gets near there, the guards
will kill her as a suspected G. Fuck!

751
00:50:50,980 --> 00:50:53,861
l'll do the best I can,
but it's very tough.

752
00:50:53,861 --> 00:50:57,690
Everybody's in the same boat.
Thousands of people want a cédula.

753
00:50:58,661 --> 00:51:02,501
Let me ask you this:
What if I married her?

754
00:51:02,501 --> 00:51:05,381
Richard, you're already married.

755
00:51:05,381 --> 00:51:08,261
Sir, I know you're busy.
Thank you for your time.

756
00:51:08,261 --> 00:51:11,142
But this is El Salvador.
Suppose I just married her?

757
00:51:11,142 --> 00:51:14,982
- I'll do whatever I can. I will.
- Thank you, sir.

758
00:51:14,982 --> 00:51:18,811
- Maybe you could talk to lmmigration?
- Just let me see what I can do.

759
00:51:19,782 --> 00:51:21,702
Joan and I want to see you
at the Christmas party.

760
00:51:21,702 --> 00:51:25,532
- Maybe I could keep in touch with you?
- Yeah, sure.

761
00:51:32,263 --> 00:51:34,183
- I give up on you.
- What do you mean, give up?

762
00:51:34,183 --> 00:51:38,023
- Every time I try to get something...
- This guy, he liked me.

763
00:51:38,023 --> 00:51:39,943
- What's up?
- I gotta get Maria a cédula.

764
00:51:39,943 --> 00:51:42,823
Maria.

765
00:51:42,823 --> 00:51:46,663
They can't find Carlos, but the
ambassador is personally involved.

766
00:51:46,663 --> 00:51:48,584
The thing is, though...

767
00:51:48,584 --> 00:51:52,413
...you're in danger. Without a cédula
they can grab you, comprende?

768
00:51:53,384 --> 00:51:57,213
So I've been thinking about something,
and what I think we should do...

769
00:52:00,104 --> 00:52:02,024
- Marry me.
- What?

770
00:52:02,024 --> 00:52:03,944
We could have a family.

771
00:52:03,944 --> 00:52:05,864
Duglas and Reina and you and me.

772
00:52:05,864 --> 00:52:09,705
- And Carlos, what about him?
- And Carlos, yes, when we find him.

773
00:52:09,705 --> 00:52:12,585
- Si?
- You already have a wife?

774
00:52:12,585 --> 00:52:16,425
No, that's been over, six months.
I got a divorce. I never told you.

775
00:52:16,425 --> 00:52:19,305
- Hi, Boyle!
- Just a second.

776
00:52:19,305 --> 00:52:21,225
- Hey, Peter.
- Atlanta's giving you a shot.

777
00:52:21,225 --> 00:52:22,185
No!

778
00:52:22,185 --> 00:52:26,026
- If you fuck up this time...
- Not a chance. That's great, man.

779
00:52:26,026 --> 00:52:28,906
I want some real stuff on the G's.

780
00:52:28,906 --> 00:52:31,786
- You set with Alvarez?
- We're like this.

781
00:52:31,786 --> 00:52:34,666
You got the camera, the crew,
and the Arena press conference.

782
00:52:34,666 --> 00:52:37,546
- Right, Major Max.
- He's gonna declare for president.

783
00:52:37,546 --> 00:52:41,386
I'm going to Venezuela, so you'll
have to cover for me.

784
00:52:41,386 --> 00:52:45,227
You're a mensch. Could you lend
me fifty bucks, man? I'm low.

785
00:52:45,227 --> 00:52:48,107
You don't change, do you?

786
00:52:48,107 --> 00:52:50,027
- This is what we got here.
- 100 would...

787
00:52:50,027 --> 00:52:51,947
- 200 of them.
- 200 colones?

788
00:52:51,947 --> 00:52:55,777
Out of my own pocket, so no whores.

789
00:52:56,747 --> 00:53:00,577
- Do a good job, Boyle.
- Peter, you're a mensch, thanks.

790
00:53:06,348 --> 00:53:10,188
- So what?
- I can't marry a divorced man.

791
00:53:10,188 --> 00:53:13,068
And you, Richard,
are a bad Catholic in all ways.

792
00:53:13,068 --> 00:53:14,988
How am I a bad Catholic?

793
00:53:14,988 --> 00:53:16,908
- You're living in sin.
- No, I'm not.

794
00:53:16,908 --> 00:53:19,788
- You drink.
- Okay, sometimes.

795
00:53:19,788 --> 00:53:22,669
You sleep with many women.

796
00:53:22,669 --> 00:53:25,549
- You smoke marijuana.
- No, that was Rock's.

797
00:53:25,549 --> 00:53:29,389
And you lie, you scheme
and you scam.

798
00:53:29,389 --> 00:53:32,269
What is good or decent about you?

799
00:53:32,269 --> 00:53:34,189
What redemption can you expect?

800
00:53:34,189 --> 00:53:38,019
Well, none. Okay, you got a point,
I am a fucking weasel.

801
00:53:38,989 --> 00:53:41,870
But think about this:
lf I went to Church...

802
00:53:41,870 --> 00:53:45,699
I haven't been to Church in 30 years,
but we'd go to communion together...

803
00:53:46,670 --> 00:53:49,550
Redemption, it'd be great!
We could go to Archbishop Romero.

804
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:52,430
He knows me
and likes me very much.

805
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:56,270
I could become a lay Catholic worker.
It'd be wonderful, I could...

806
00:53:56,270 --> 00:54:00,100
This redemption thing feels good.
I feel cleansed already.

807
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:04,911
- You want some of this?
- No, no more marijuana.

808
00:54:04,911 --> 00:54:08,740
It's possible Archbishop Romero
could annul my marriage to Claudia.

809
00:54:09,711 --> 00:54:12,591
She was a Commie atheist anyway.

810
00:54:12,591 --> 00:54:15,471
I'm gonna talk to him
about this, seriously.

811
00:54:15,471 --> 00:54:16,431
Very good man.

812
00:54:16,431 --> 00:54:20,261
Man of the people. Man of God.
He could win the Nobel Peace Prize.

813
00:54:21,232 --> 00:54:24,112
Hey, what's this?
Another demonstration, Boyle?

814
00:54:24,112 --> 00:54:27,942
Calm down, take it easy...

815
00:54:42,353 --> 00:54:46,182
Stop-stop, please.

816
00:54:47,153 --> 00:54:50,033
I have orders to evacuate the plaza
in five minutes. Do you understand me?

817
00:54:50,033 --> 00:54:53,873
I have superior orders signed.

818
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,794
Why don't you stop the repression?

819
00:54:55,794 --> 00:54:59,634
No matter... five minutes or violence.

820
00:54:59,634 --> 00:55:01,554
Why don't you do something
about the Disappeared?

821
00:55:01,554 --> 00:55:03,474
Violence! You understand me?

822
00:55:03,474 --> 00:55:07,304
Stop the repression!

823
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:29,395
Do you follow in the way of Christ?

824
00:55:29,395 --> 00:55:32,275
Not exactly.
I mean, in my heart, yes.

825
00:55:32,275 --> 00:55:36,105
But I've done a lot of, you know...

826
00:55:38,036 --> 00:55:40,916
...carnal sins, and...

827
00:55:40,916 --> 00:55:43,796
...drunk a lot of alcohol,
and done some drugs.

828
00:55:43,796 --> 00:55:47,636
I've weaseled around in my life,
trying to get the edge all the time.

829
00:55:47,636 --> 00:55:50,516
But basically,
I'm a good-hearted person.

830
00:55:50,516 --> 00:55:53,397
I haven't done anything
malicious in my life.

831
00:55:53,397 --> 00:55:56,277
I haven't done anything great either.

832
00:55:56,277 --> 00:56:00,106
I've tried to do things, find truths.
I do love this woman.

833
00:56:01,077 --> 00:56:03,957
- For her, I'd...
- You'd change for this woman.

834
00:56:03,957 --> 00:56:07,787
For this woman I'm willing to change.
I mean not just...

835
00:56:08,757 --> 00:56:11,638
If God gave me this woman...

836
00:56:11,638 --> 00:56:14,518
...then there must be a God.

837
00:56:14,518 --> 00:56:18,347
So if He knows what's right,
then I'd do what's right by Him.

838
00:56:19,318 --> 00:56:22,198
Just repent. Change your ways.

839
00:56:22,198 --> 00:56:26,038
That's gonna be a little tough.

840
00:56:26,038 --> 00:56:28,919
You love this woman,
you will be willing to change.

841
00:56:28,919 --> 00:56:31,799
Okay, I can still drink...

842
00:56:31,799 --> 00:56:35,639
...and take a few hits from a joint
once in a while, right? That's okay?

843
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:39,469
Twelve Our Fathers, ten Hail Marys,
and an Act of Contrition.

844
00:56:40,439 --> 00:56:41,399
That's it?

845
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:45,229
Ask the Lord for forgiveness
from your heart.

846
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:50,029
From my heart.

847
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,880
If I'd known this, I would've come
earlier, before 33 years.

848
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,800
You should've come earlier.

849
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:59,630
- I'll come back.
- Next time don't wait so long.

850
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:05,390
The governing junta has good intentions
with their promises of land reform...

851
00:57:06,361 --> 00:57:09,241
and their desire to control...

852
00:57:09,241 --> 00:57:12,121
the so-called paramilitary forces
in the Army.

853
00:57:12,121 --> 00:57:15,001
But, sadly, it is a failure...

854
00:57:15,001 --> 00:57:17,881
because the power within the junta
is the Army...

855
00:57:17,881 --> 00:57:21,711
and the Army itself is an obstacle
to the reign of God.

856
00:57:22,681 --> 00:57:24,601
They know only how to repress
the people...

857
00:57:24,601 --> 00:57:28,431
and defend the interests
of the rich oligarchy.

858
00:57:29,402 --> 00:57:33,242
I have called upon the United States,
repeatedly...

859
00:57:33,242 --> 00:57:37,082
to stop all military aid to this Army...

860
00:57:37,082 --> 00:57:40,922
until it satisfactorily resolves
the problems of the Disappeared...

861
00:57:40,922 --> 00:57:43,803
and submits itself to
civilian control.

862
00:57:43,803 --> 00:57:47,643
When a dictatorship
seriously violates human rights...

863
00:57:47,643 --> 00:57:50,523
and attacks the common good
of the nation...

864
00:57:50,523 --> 00:57:54,353
When it becomes unbearable
and closes all channels of dialogue...

865
00:57:55,323 --> 00:57:58,203
When this happens,
the Church speaks...

866
00:57:58,203 --> 00:58:02,033
of the legitimate right
of insurrectional violence!

867
00:58:04,924 --> 00:58:08,753
We are poor.
You in Washington are so rich.

868
00:58:11,644 --> 00:58:15,474
Why are you so blind?

869
00:58:17,404 --> 00:58:20,284
My children...

870
00:58:20,284 --> 00:58:24,125
you must look to yourselves...

871
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:27,965
in this sad time for Salvador.

872
00:58:27,965 --> 00:58:31,795
I wish to close with an appeal
to the men of the Army...

873
00:58:33,725 --> 00:58:37,555
and in particular, the National Guard.

874
00:58:40,446 --> 00:58:44,275
Brothers, you are part of your people.

875
00:58:46,206 --> 00:58:50,036
Yet you kill your own
brothers and sisters.

876
00:58:51,966 --> 00:58:55,806
But before a man may kill,
the law of God must prevail.

877
00:58:55,806 --> 00:58:59,636
And that law says,
"Thou shalt not kill."

878
00:59:00,607 --> 00:59:04,436
No soldier is obliged to obey an order
against the law of God.

879
00:59:05,407 --> 00:59:09,247
Violence on all sides is wrong.

880
00:59:09,247 --> 00:59:11,167
Violence is wrong.

881
00:59:11,167 --> 00:59:15,007
In the name of God, and in the name
of this suffering people...

882
00:59:15,007 --> 00:59:18,848
Whose laments rise to Heaven
each day more tumultuous...

883
00:59:18,848 --> 00:59:21,728
I beg you...

884
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:22,688
I ask you...

885
00:59:22,688 --> 00:59:25,568
I order you in the name of God...

886
00:59:25,568 --> 00:59:29,398
Stop the repression!

887
01:01:22,694 --> 01:01:26,524
Arrest him for the murder
of Archbishop Romero.

888
01:01:36,135 --> 01:01:39,965
Taxi! Taxi!

889
01:02:09,737 --> 01:02:12,617
You will note, I did not agree
with the bishop.

890
01:02:12,617 --> 01:02:15,497
He sometimes got carried away
with his politics.

891
01:02:15,497 --> 01:02:19,327
He did not understand
that with the Left in power...

892
01:02:20,297 --> 01:02:23,177
...there will be no Church
in this country.

893
01:02:23,177 --> 01:02:27,007
And he will be out of a job.

894
01:02:28,938 --> 01:02:31,818
In my book, it was the subversives
that killed him.

895
01:02:31,818 --> 01:02:35,648
No question. To provoke
this atmosphere, this cause.

896
01:02:39,498 --> 01:02:43,328
It's rumored that you're head of the
death squads terrorizing the city.

897
01:02:44,299 --> 01:02:47,179
Care to comment?

898
01:02:47,179 --> 01:02:51,019
- You're pressing your luck, Boyle.
- Nice going, Boyle.

899
01:02:51,019 --> 01:02:53,899
I really resent that question.

900
01:02:53,899 --> 01:02:54,859
Get the fuck off.

901
01:02:54,859 --> 01:02:57,739
Why do you never ask
the Communist leaders?

902
01:02:57,739 --> 01:03:01,569
They are not the only victims.
We have victims too.

903
01:03:05,420 --> 01:03:09,260
They know there are no death squads
in El Salvador.

904
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:12,140
The outrage of the people against
the Communist threat...

905
01:03:12,140 --> 01:03:15,970
...cannot be stopped
or organized by anyone.

906
01:03:18,860 --> 01:03:22,701
Sir, the polls show you trailing
the Christian Democrats.

907
01:03:22,701 --> 01:03:26,541
Are you sure you can capture both
the Catholic and the woman's vote?

908
01:03:26,541 --> 01:03:30,370
Bullshit question. Saves a tape.

909
01:03:35,181 --> 01:03:38,061
Do you mind? I'm gonna buy it
for my sister. Looks nice.

910
01:03:38,061 --> 01:03:40,942
Oh, here he comes. Mr. Gomez?

911
01:03:40,942 --> 01:03:42,862
Mr. Gomez, question, please.

912
01:03:42,862 --> 01:03:43,822
Get him, get him.

913
01:03:43,822 --> 01:03:47,651
No interviews with this piece of shit.

914
01:03:54,382 --> 01:03:57,262
What are you gonna do about it, fatso?

915
01:03:57,262 --> 01:03:59,183
This is not going to fly.

916
01:03:59,183 --> 01:04:01,103
Think about your image.

917
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:04,943
Shit about your image.
l'll cut your balls off, Boyle!

918
01:04:04,943 --> 01:04:08,783
Do it yourself, huh?

919
01:04:08,783 --> 01:04:11,663
Huh, you chicken shit?

920
01:04:11,663 --> 01:04:15,493
Hi, you guys from Washington? Huh?

921
01:04:23,184 --> 01:04:27,013
You're a real pro, Boyle.

922
01:04:32,784 --> 01:04:34,704
Doc! Doc, where's Maria?

923
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:38,545
Boyle! They found Carlos, man.

924
01:04:38,545 --> 01:04:40,465
- Where?
- He's fucked up.

925
01:04:40,465 --> 01:04:44,294
Over there, man, he's really
fucked up bad.

926
01:05:59,189 --> 01:06:01,109
- Maria, please.
- Don't touch me!

927
01:06:01,109 --> 01:06:03,029
He was acting stupid! Why blame me?

928
01:06:03,029 --> 01:06:06,859
Ever since you've gotten here
there's been nothing but problems.

929
01:06:07,829 --> 01:06:10,710
It wasn't my fault!

930
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:14,539
Great going, Boyle. Have a drink.

931
01:06:16,470 --> 01:06:20,300
Damn it.

932
01:06:22,230 --> 01:06:24,150
I really love her, man. I mean...

933
01:06:24,150 --> 01:06:27,980
...she and the kids were the only
decent thing I ever had in my life.

934
01:06:30,871 --> 01:06:34,700
I don't know why I'm living anymore.

935
01:07:05,433 --> 01:07:06,393
That's all I got is 10.

936
01:07:06,393 --> 01:07:10,233
- Fifteen.
- I was only in there for five minutes.

937
01:07:10,233 --> 01:07:11,193
That guy kept interrupting me.

938
01:07:11,193 --> 01:07:15,022
I would have been out of there faster.
All I got is 10.

939
01:07:15,993 --> 01:07:19,823
Okay, 10.

940
01:07:42,875 --> 01:07:44,795
You asshole.

941
01:07:44,795 --> 01:07:47,675
l'll give you 50 percent interest.

942
01:07:47,675 --> 01:07:49,595
- Know what you said?
- Huh?

943
01:07:49,595 --> 01:07:53,425
That you'd pay her
in two menstrual cycles, you moron.

944
01:08:18,396 --> 01:08:22,226
I'm sure you don't need it,
and I can't say I approve, but...

945
01:08:23,197 --> 01:08:27,026
...merry Christmas, Richard.

946
01:08:32,797 --> 01:08:36,637
Get over here. Get over here.

947
01:08:36,637 --> 01:08:39,518
Get over here.

948
01:08:39,518 --> 01:08:41,438
Oh, Richard.

949
01:08:41,438 --> 01:08:45,278
Cathy, talk to Maria.

950
01:08:45,278 --> 01:08:49,118
I need Maria. Talk to Father Paul.
She listens to him.

951
01:08:49,118 --> 01:08:52,958
You're old enough to be her father.
Forget her.

952
01:08:52,958 --> 01:08:53,918
I'm in love with her.

953
01:08:53,918 --> 01:08:57,759
I love you, Richie.

954
01:08:57,759 --> 01:09:01,588
Father Paul has to follow
the papal orders, there's nothing...

955
01:09:02,559 --> 01:09:06,388
I hate that.
I hate when you do that so much.

956
01:09:07,359 --> 01:09:11,199
- What about your other wife and kid?
- She left me. She took my kid.

957
01:09:11,199 --> 01:09:14,079
So you're going to bring Maria
back with you?

958
01:09:14,079 --> 01:09:17,909
What's she gonna do, Richard?
Sell snow cones on Fisherman's Wharf?

959
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,709
Down here she has a purpose.
Up there she's a fish out of water.

960
01:09:23,680 --> 01:09:24,640
Yeah, I know.

961
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:28,480
You don't have enough money
to support the kid you've already got.

962
01:09:28,480 --> 01:09:32,320
I need to talk to you about
my whole life, it's such a mess.

963
01:09:32,320 --> 01:09:34,240
- It's disgusting.
- You're disgusting.

964
01:09:34,240 --> 01:09:37,121
What are you doing here?

965
01:09:37,121 --> 01:09:40,961
- You're not making it as a journalist.
- I'll make it again.

966
01:09:40,961 --> 01:09:44,790
I will make it again.

967
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:54,391
The white hand's been painted
on the parish house wall.

968
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:58,242
Your altar boy is dead.

969
01:09:58,242 --> 01:10:02,071
Even the Peace Corps has moved out.

970
01:10:04,002 --> 01:10:06,882
I love it here.

971
01:10:06,882 --> 01:10:09,762
I just can't go back.

972
01:10:09,762 --> 01:10:13,592
I know. I love it here too.

973
01:10:15,523 --> 01:10:19,363
- Can you have dinner with me?
- No.

974
01:10:19,363 --> 01:10:23,203
- Tomorrow night?
- No, I can't. Besides, you smell.

975
01:10:23,203 --> 01:10:27,043
I'm going to the airport tomorrow.
Two nuns are coming in.

976
01:10:27,043 --> 01:10:28,963
Sometime?

977
01:10:28,963 --> 01:10:31,844
Maybe.

978
01:10:31,844 --> 01:10:35,673
- Be careful on the way to the airport.
- Yeah.

979
01:10:48,164 --> 01:10:51,994
Wait a minute,
l'll walk you to your car.

980
01:11:02,565 --> 01:11:05,445
- Merry Christmas, Richard.
- Bye.

981
01:11:05,445 --> 01:11:06,405
- You be good.
- I will.

982
01:11:06,405 --> 01:11:10,235
- I don't trust you.
- I will be.

983
01:11:11,206 --> 01:11:15,035
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Bye.

984
01:11:29,447 --> 01:11:32,327
Gringo.

985
01:11:32,327 --> 01:11:36,156
Let's take a walk
down by the beach, gringo.

986
01:11:37,127 --> 01:11:39,047
I'm not going to the beach with you.

987
01:11:39,047 --> 01:11:42,877
l'll tell you something else, I'm not
only a fucking lrishman, I'm...

988
01:11:46,728 --> 01:11:49,608
...l'm a fucking Viking.

989
01:11:49,608 --> 01:11:53,437
l'll take as many of these creeps
to fucking Valhalla as I can!

990
01:11:54,408 --> 01:11:58,248
You got a big mouth.
Major Max has got a present for you.

991
01:11:58,248 --> 01:11:59,208
Come to the beach.

992
01:11:59,208 --> 01:12:03,048
Come on, cocksucker,
you'll have to fucking kill me!

993
01:12:03,048 --> 01:12:06,878
You ain't fucking taking me alive!
Come on!

994
01:12:23,209 --> 01:12:27,039
You want to play
a fucking game, Boyle?

995
01:12:28,010 --> 01:12:30,890
Okay, first l'll take your arms...

996
01:12:30,890 --> 01:12:32,810
...then l'll take your legs...

997
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:36,640
...then your balls.
Sound like a fun game?

998
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:44,320
Okay, cocksuckers,
how do you like these odds, huh?

999
01:12:48,171 --> 01:12:52,000
He's worthless.

1000
01:12:52,971 --> 01:12:56,801
You are an important man, Jefe.

1001
01:12:57,771 --> 01:13:01,601
A photograph for me?

1002
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:24,642
Enough!

1003
01:13:27,533 --> 01:13:31,373
Boyle, l'll be back for you.

1004
01:13:31,373 --> 01:13:35,203
Fuck you!

1005
01:13:40,974 --> 01:13:44,803
Yeah, up yours too, Jack.

1006
01:14:05,935 --> 01:14:08,815
- How was Nicaragua?
- Oh, bad.

1007
01:14:08,815 --> 01:14:12,655
There's no gasoline.
People line up for hours to get food.

1008
01:14:12,655 --> 01:14:14,575
Worse than...
Very, very destructive.

1009
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:18,405
On the other hand, there's been
no political execution of Somazastias.

1010
01:14:19,376 --> 01:14:22,256
I can't believe this.
Get your passports ready.

1011
01:14:22,256 --> 01:14:26,085
What's the matter?

1012
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:38,566
We have done nothing!

1013
01:14:41,457 --> 01:14:45,287
I'm a good friend of Ambassador Kelly.
You'll be in a lot of trouble.

1014
01:16:07,861 --> 01:16:11,702
The bodies of four American women
missing since Tuesday were found...

1015
01:16:11,702 --> 01:16:13,622
...here today, at a roadside grave...

1016
01:16:13,622 --> 01:16:16,502
...25 miles east of San Salvador.

1017
01:16:16,502 --> 01:16:20,332
The victims were identified as...

1018
01:16:31,863 --> 01:16:35,703
I just heard five guards did it for
15 colones and a bottle of Tic Tack.

1019
01:16:35,703 --> 01:16:39,533
And they got this clown mayor
to sign the death certificates.

1020
01:16:40,503 --> 01:16:43,383
- Will he talk?
- If we can keep him alive.

1021
01:16:43,383 --> 01:16:47,213
- What are the chances of that?
- Slim to none, and he knows it.

1022
01:16:48,184 --> 01:16:51,064
He had no business signing
without an autopsy.

1023
01:16:51,064 --> 01:16:54,904
I want to know if those bullets
are rebel or government!

1024
01:16:54,904 --> 01:16:58,744
You knew Cathy well, didn't you?

1025
01:16:58,744 --> 01:16:59,704
What do you think?

1026
01:16:59,704 --> 01:17:03,534
Rumor has it they ran a roadblock
and there was an exchange of gunfire.

1027
01:17:10,265 --> 01:17:14,105
He says the doctors won't do it
because they don't...

1028
01:17:14,105 --> 01:17:16,985
- They don't have their masks.
- Masks, huh?

1029
01:17:16,985 --> 01:17:20,815
Okay, pal. All right.

1030
01:17:23,706 --> 01:17:25,626
We're cutting off all aid as of today.

1031
01:17:25,626 --> 01:17:29,455
Sir, they were coming from Managua,
and they were Communist-oriented.

1032
01:17:30,426 --> 01:17:34,266
Maybe they got spooked at the
roadblock, maybe they were packing.

1033
01:17:34,266 --> 01:17:37,146
Pistol-packing nuns, my ass.

1034
01:17:37,146 --> 01:17:40,026
I knew Cathy.
You can't sell me that shit.

1035
01:17:40,026 --> 01:17:43,867
General Garcia has assured me
of a complete investigation.

1036
01:17:43,867 --> 01:17:46,747
Have the fox investigate
the chicken coop, huh?

1037
01:17:46,747 --> 01:17:49,627
You must think I'm stupid, colonel.

1038
01:17:49,627 --> 01:17:50,587
I know all about you.

1039
01:17:50,587 --> 01:17:54,417
Reagan's team coming down here to talk
to Max without checking with me.

1040
01:17:56,347 --> 01:17:58,267
It's all going in my report.

1041
01:17:58,267 --> 01:18:02,097
You gave a clear signal to the
Arana people that resulted in this.

1042
01:19:54,434 --> 01:19:58,263
We want to do a real in-depth
and sympathetic portrait.

1043
01:20:01,154 --> 01:20:03,074
For the first time
our armies are united.

1044
01:20:03,074 --> 01:20:05,954
We now control a third
of Chatalengo in the west...

1045
01:20:05,954 --> 01:20:08,834
COMANDANTE MARTI Nom de Guerre
Field Commander, Rebel Army

1046
01:20:08,834 --> 01:20:10,754
...and Morazon Province in the east.

1047
01:20:10,754 --> 01:20:14,584
We want the people and all government
troops to join our final offense.

1048
01:20:16,515 --> 01:20:18,435
We'll take all major cities.

1049
01:20:18,435 --> 01:20:21,315
Santa Ana, San Vicente, San Miguel.

1050
01:20:21,315 --> 01:20:23,235
Then San Salvador will fall.

1051
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:26,115
When, captain?

1052
01:20:26,115 --> 01:20:27,075
Before Reagan.

1053
01:20:27,075 --> 01:20:28,995
And you think you're ready?

1054
01:20:28,995 --> 01:20:31,876
With 4000 troops,
take all of El Salvador?

1055
01:20:31,876 --> 01:20:34,756
The Pentagon won't let it happen.

1056
01:20:34,756 --> 01:20:38,596
The will of the people and the march
of history cannot be changed.

1057
01:20:38,596 --> 01:20:42,426
Not even by the Norteamericanos.

1058
01:20:43,396 --> 01:20:45,316
What does it say?

1059
01:20:45,316 --> 01:20:49,146
"Leticia cleans her gun."

1060
01:21:18,918 --> 01:21:22,758
- Careful on the way out.
- Don't worry, I have experience.

1061
01:21:22,758 --> 01:21:24,678
- I'm serious.
- Thanks.

1062
01:21:24,678 --> 01:21:28,508
- Good luck.
- Okay, bye. Thank you.

1063
01:21:41,959 --> 01:21:43,879
This doesn't show much.

1064
01:21:43,879 --> 01:21:47,709
I stuck my neck out for you, Boyle.
You're not too popular around here.

1065
01:21:48,680 --> 01:21:52,520
- Where were these taken?
- I can't tell you, but it's old stuff.

1066
01:21:52,520 --> 01:21:55,400
Shotguns, bolt action rifles,
captured Belgian FLNs.

1067
01:21:55,400 --> 01:21:59,240
Fifty cals, 120 mike-mikes
taken from government troops.

1068
01:21:59,240 --> 01:22:03,070
- Any anti-aircraft stuff? Any SAMs?
- Nothing.

1069
01:22:05,961 --> 01:22:09,790
How about it? How about a cédula
for my woman and her two kids?

1070
01:22:10,761 --> 01:22:12,681
There's not much, or you're
not saying everything.

1071
01:22:12,681 --> 01:22:14,601
Christ!

1072
01:22:14,601 --> 01:22:16,521
What about recoilless rifles, RPGs?

1073
01:22:16,521 --> 01:22:18,441
They're in shit shape,
getting nothing.

1074
01:22:18,441 --> 01:22:21,321
When will you believe
what your eyes see...

1075
01:22:21,321 --> 01:22:23,242
...and not what Intelligence
tells you to think?

1076
01:22:23,242 --> 01:22:27,071
We got AWACs, infrareds, statements
from a defecting FRAN commandant...

1077
01:22:28,042 --> 01:22:30,922
...and enough military intel to
prove 10,000 percent...

1078
01:22:30,922 --> 01:22:34,762
...that this ain't no civil war,
but Commie aggression.

1079
01:22:34,762 --> 01:22:36,682
You've been lying about
that from the beginning.

1080
01:22:36,682 --> 01:22:40,522
You've not presented one shred of
proof to the American public...

1081
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:43,403
...that this is anything but
a legitimate peasant revolution.

1082
01:22:43,403 --> 01:22:46,283
Don't tell me about the sanctity
of military intelligence.

1083
01:22:46,283 --> 01:22:49,163
Not after Chile and Vietnam.
I was there, remember?

1084
01:22:49,163 --> 01:22:51,083
I personally resent that kind of shit.

1085
01:22:51,083 --> 01:22:53,003
Then resent it, okay?

1086
01:22:53,003 --> 01:22:54,923
You've lied about the advisers here.

1087
01:22:54,923 --> 01:22:57,803
- Lied about the trainers on TTY.
- Bullshit!

1088
01:22:57,803 --> 01:23:00,684
You're lying about switching
humanitarian assistance money...

1089
01:23:00,684 --> 01:23:02,604
...to Salvadoran military coffers.

1090
01:23:02,604 --> 01:23:05,484
It's a lie that this war can be
won militarily, it can't.

1091
01:23:05,484 --> 01:23:06,444
Of course it can.

1092
01:23:06,444 --> 01:23:09,324
Calm down, Boyle.
I'm sorry about this.

1093
01:23:09,324 --> 01:23:13,164
I'm not gonna listen to this wino
journalist's left-wing Commie crap.

1094
01:23:13,164 --> 01:23:17,004
We know where this guy's sympathies
lie. Why are we talking to him?

1095
01:23:17,004 --> 01:23:19,885
Look, Richard, you saw Martin.

1096
01:23:19,885 --> 01:23:22,765
We know they're starting
some kind of an offensive.

1097
01:23:22,765 --> 01:23:25,645
I'm not a fucking spy for you guys.

1098
01:23:25,645 --> 01:23:27,565
Left-wing, colonel? Well, maybe.

1099
01:23:27,565 --> 01:23:31,405
But I'm not a Communist, and you guys
are never able to tell the difference.

1100
01:23:31,405 --> 01:23:32,365
- Is that a fact?
- Yeah.

1101
01:23:32,365 --> 01:23:35,245
I love my country the same as you.
That may surprise you.

1102
01:23:35,245 --> 01:23:39,086
You're the ones who trained Major Max
at the police academy.

1103
01:23:39,086 --> 01:23:41,966
You trained Jose Medrano
and Rene Chacon.

1104
01:23:41,966 --> 01:23:44,846
Trained them to torture and kill,
then sent them here.

1105
01:23:44,846 --> 01:23:47,726
What did Chacon give us?
He gave us the Mano Blanco.

1106
01:23:47,726 --> 01:23:51,566
What are the death squads,
but the brainchild of the CIA?

1107
01:23:51,566 --> 01:23:54,446
- You like that they're anti-Moscow.
- Bullshit!

1108
01:23:54,446 --> 01:23:58,287
You let them close the universities,
wipe out the best minds.

1109
01:23:58,287 --> 01:24:01,167
You let them wipe out
the Catholic Church.

1110
01:24:01,167 --> 01:24:04,047
You let them do it all
because they aren't Commies.

1111
01:24:04,047 --> 01:24:07,887
And that, colonel, is bullshit.

1112
01:24:07,887 --> 01:24:10,767
You've created a major Frankenstein.

1113
01:24:10,767 --> 01:24:12,687
We can control him.

1114
01:24:12,687 --> 01:24:13,647
Like you control the Major Maxes...

1115
01:24:13,647 --> 01:24:17,488
- Well, look who's here.
- Hi.

1116
01:24:17,488 --> 01:24:20,368
What about Pol Pot and Castro?
Are they any better?

1117
01:24:20,368 --> 01:24:24,208
Pol Pot and Castro?
I don't know if they're better.

1118
01:24:24,208 --> 01:24:27,088
All I know is that some campecino
who can't read or write...

1119
01:24:27,088 --> 01:24:30,928
...or feed his family, has to watch
his kid die of malnutrition.

1120
01:24:30,928 --> 01:24:32,848
You think he gives a shit
about Marxism or capitalism?

1121
01:24:32,848 --> 01:24:36,678
It was that kind of crap thinking that
lost us Vietnam, this guilt shit.

1122
01:24:37,649 --> 01:24:41,489
You liberal assholes. What do you
think the KGB's doing, huh?

1123
01:24:41,489 --> 01:24:42,449
Is that why you're here?

1124
01:24:42,449 --> 01:24:46,289
Some kind of post-Vietnam experience,
like you need a rerun?

1125
01:24:46,289 --> 01:24:50,129
You pour $120 million in here and
turn it into a military zone.

1126
01:24:50,129 --> 01:24:53,010
- So you can have chopper parades?
- You're blowing it out your ass.

1127
01:24:53,010 --> 01:24:54,930
You're only bringing misery
to these people.

1128
01:24:54,930 --> 01:24:56,850
I don't want to see another Vietnam.

1129
01:24:56,850 --> 01:24:59,730
I don't want to see America
get another bad rap.

1130
01:24:59,730 --> 01:25:03,570
I lost my hearing in this ear
over there, and for what?

1131
01:25:03,570 --> 01:25:07,410
Fifteen dollars a photo
from Pacific News Service?

1132
01:25:07,410 --> 01:25:11,250
I did it because
I believe in America.

1133
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:14,131
I believe that we stand
for something.

1134
01:25:14,131 --> 01:25:16,051
For a constitution.

1135
01:25:16,051 --> 01:25:18,931
For human rights, not just
for a few people...

1136
01:25:18,931 --> 01:25:22,761
...but for everybody on this planet.

1137
01:25:27,571 --> 01:25:29,491
You gotta think of the people first.

1138
01:25:29,491 --> 01:25:33,321
In the name of human decency, something
Americans are supposed to believe in.

1139
01:25:34,292 --> 01:25:38,132
You've got to try to make
something of a just society here.

1140
01:25:38,132 --> 01:25:41,972
Look, Richard, it's all part of our
national plan.

1141
01:25:41,972 --> 01:25:45,812
We do a lot of good down here.

1142
01:25:45,812 --> 01:25:48,692
I'm often asked by people like
you to examine my conscience...

1143
01:25:48,692 --> 01:25:52,522
...and I do examine it.
- And what do you find, Jack?

1144
01:25:53,493 --> 01:25:56,373
That whatever mistakes we make
down here...

1145
01:25:56,373 --> 01:26:00,203
...the alternative would be ten
times worse.

1146
01:26:03,093 --> 01:26:06,923
Maybe l'll just, like, forge
a cédula for my girlfriend...

1147
01:26:10,774 --> 01:26:14,614
They're on the house.

1148
01:26:14,614 --> 01:26:17,494
Boyle.

1149
01:26:17,494 --> 01:26:21,334
Boyle!

1150
01:26:21,334 --> 01:26:24,214
There's something you should know.

1151
01:26:24,214 --> 01:26:27,095
My Salvo counterparts are mighty
pissed about some periodistas...

1152
01:26:27,095 --> 01:26:29,015
...going out with the terrorists.

1153
01:26:29,015 --> 01:26:32,855
If they can catch one,
they'll make a lesson out of him.

1154
01:26:32,855 --> 01:26:33,815
Look, l'll get out of your hair.

1155
01:26:33,815 --> 01:26:37,655
Just get me a cédula for my girlfriend
and her two kids, I'm gone.

1156
01:26:37,655 --> 01:26:41,495
Getting a cédula for your whore
is the least of your problems.

1157
01:26:41,495 --> 01:26:44,375
Personally, I don't give a shit
if they kill you or not.

1158
01:26:44,375 --> 01:26:47,256
I happen to hate the species
you belong to.

1159
01:26:47,256 --> 01:26:51,096
But I'm telling you,
they're serious.

1160
01:26:51,096 --> 01:26:54,925
If I were you, I'd get my rubber
shoes on and get to the airport.

1161
01:26:55,896 --> 01:26:58,776
You'll fit in here really well,
you know that?

1162
01:26:58,776 --> 01:27:01,656
You sound just like another gangster.

1163
01:27:01,656 --> 01:27:03,576
Dumb fuck!

1164
01:27:03,576 --> 01:27:07,417
...a panning shot for the beginning
of the interview, okay?

1165
01:27:07,417 --> 01:27:09,337
Come over here.

1166
01:27:09,337 --> 01:27:13,177
- Can you tell me your name?
- Sorry, we can't speak to the press.

1167
01:27:13,177 --> 01:27:15,097
Thank you, private. I appreciate it.

1168
01:27:15,097 --> 01:27:17,977
- Can you tell me your name?
- No, I'm sorry, I cannot.

1169
01:27:17,977 --> 01:27:21,817
- How about where you're from?
- Okay. Long lsland, New York.

1170
01:27:21,817 --> 01:27:24,698
Well, welcome to El Salvador,
what do you think?

1171
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:27,578
It's not bad, but I'm anxious
to watch the Giants' game.

1172
01:27:27,578 --> 01:27:30,458
- Know where a TV is?
- I don't know.

1173
01:27:30,458 --> 01:27:31,418
Thanks, soldier.

1174
01:27:31,418 --> 01:27:34,298
Excuse me, colonel.
Pauline Axelrod, ANS News.

1175
01:27:34,298 --> 01:27:38,128
Does this signal a buildup of
U.S. combat troops here in El Salvador?

1176
01:27:39,098 --> 01:27:41,018
Ma'am, these are not combat troops.

1177
01:27:41,018 --> 01:27:43,899
They're trainers,
officially authorized by Congress.

1178
01:27:43,899 --> 01:27:46,779
- No further comment.
- Thank you, sir.

1179
01:27:46,779 --> 01:27:49,659
This is Pauline Axelrod,
ANS News, San Salvador.

1180
01:27:49,659 --> 01:27:52,539
Listen, you got one thing
going for you...

1181
01:27:52,539 --> 01:27:54,459
...and that's
Maria still cares about you.

1182
01:27:54,459 --> 01:27:56,379
She does.

1183
01:27:56,379 --> 01:28:00,220
If I were you, I'd straighten out my
act and go back to her on my knees.

1184
01:28:00,220 --> 01:28:03,100
Doc, please.

1185
01:28:03,100 --> 01:28:05,980
All right, just trying to help you.

1186
01:28:05,980 --> 01:28:07,900
Doc!

1187
01:28:07,900 --> 01:28:10,780
- Wilma! Hi, how are you?
- Fine.

1188
01:28:10,780 --> 01:28:13,660
Boyle, did you meet Wilma?

1189
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:17,500
- Is this Wilma from the Panama Club?
- Well, she straightened up her act.

1190
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,421
And look at this.

1191
01:28:19,421 --> 01:28:21,341
Bagel II, huh?

1192
01:28:21,341 --> 01:28:22,301
That's great, Doc.

1193
01:28:22,301 --> 01:28:25,181
- Come on. Let's go.
- She wants to take me shopping.

1194
01:28:25,181 --> 01:28:29,021
- Do something about these drinks?
- Let me... Just a couple bucks.

1195
01:28:29,021 --> 01:28:32,851
- What's this?
- She had a long career.

1196
01:28:35,741 --> 01:28:39,571
- Thanks.
- See you.

1197
01:28:40,542 --> 01:28:44,382
- Rich, you still got your wheels?
- Yeah.

1198
01:28:44,382 --> 01:28:47,262
The G's just hit Santa Ana.

1199
01:28:47,262 --> 01:28:50,142
- Wait, I gotta stop in the Libertad.
- No.

1200
01:28:50,142 --> 01:28:52,062
- I gotta see Maria.
- No.

1201
01:28:52,062 --> 01:28:53,982
Then go without me.

1202
01:28:53,982 --> 01:28:57,812
All right, come on.

1203
01:30:35,748 --> 01:30:38,628
Shit!

1204
01:30:38,628 --> 01:30:42,458
Oh, fuck.

1205
01:31:04,549 --> 01:31:08,390
Sign!

1206
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:12,219
Oh, fuck me.

1207
01:31:54,472 --> 01:31:58,312
John!

1208
01:31:58,312 --> 01:32:02,142
Look!

1209
01:32:10,793 --> 01:32:12,713
John, wait! Shit.

1210
01:32:12,713 --> 01:32:14,633
Crazy...!
John!

1211
01:32:14,633 --> 01:32:18,463
Fuck.

1212
01:32:19,433 --> 01:32:22,314
You crazy fucking fool!
You're not that magic!

1213
01:32:22,314 --> 01:32:26,143
Today I am, Boyle.

1214
01:33:05,516 --> 01:33:09,356
The Sandanistas have entered the war.
Equipment's being unloaded at Fonteca.

1215
01:33:09,356 --> 01:33:12,236
- Possibly troops too.
- Any backup?

1216
01:33:12,236 --> 01:33:15,116
No time. Santa Ana's fallen.
The country's split.

1217
01:33:15,116 --> 01:33:17,996
The First Army's wiped out.
It's deteriorating very fast.

1218
01:33:17,996 --> 01:33:19,917
El Salvador will fall in 48 hours.

1219
01:33:19,917 --> 01:33:22,797
In 24. Their air force
has no ammo, no gas.

1220
01:33:22,797 --> 01:33:25,677
We restore military aid
or go to Phase Three.

1221
01:33:25,677 --> 01:33:28,557
The 82nd Airborne's on alert
and Marines are in position.

1222
01:33:28,557 --> 01:33:31,437
- God almighty.
- What do you want to do?

1223
01:33:31,437 --> 01:33:35,267
I won't get steamrolled into this.
Get substantiation on Nicaragua.

1224
01:33:36,237 --> 01:33:38,158
That would take days.

1225
01:33:38,158 --> 01:33:41,038
If we don't give the order
to evacuate soon...

1226
01:33:41,038 --> 01:33:42,958
...I can't be responsible
for the safety of the embassy...

1227
01:33:42,958 --> 01:33:45,838
...or the American community here.

1228
01:33:45,838 --> 01:33:46,798
Listen, Tom...

1229
01:33:46,798 --> 01:33:50,638
...we know you're leaving
in a few days, that's not the issue.

1230
01:33:50,638 --> 01:33:54,478
The issue is, do you want to go down
in the history books...

1231
01:33:54,478 --> 01:33:57,359
...as the man who lost El Salvador?

1232
01:33:57,359 --> 01:34:00,239
That's hardly the issue!

1233
01:34:00,239 --> 01:34:02,159
We're talking about human lives!

1234
01:34:02,159 --> 01:34:04,079
We're not playing some computer game!

1235
01:34:04,079 --> 01:34:07,919
Jesus, history books!

1236
01:34:07,919 --> 01:34:11,749
God!

1237
01:34:40,561 --> 01:34:43,441
The line is dead, sir.

1238
01:34:43,441 --> 01:34:47,271
Where the fuck are the Americans?

1239
01:35:00,722 --> 01:35:03,602
Sir...

1240
01:35:03,602 --> 01:35:07,432
...you have a decision to make.

1241
01:35:08,402 --> 01:35:10,322
All right.

1242
01:35:10,322 --> 01:35:12,243
Okay.

1243
01:35:12,243 --> 01:35:16,083
l'll recommend that we restore
all military aid.

1244
01:35:16,083 --> 01:35:19,912
Give the order to release
the fuel and arms runs to llopango.

1245
01:35:21,843 --> 01:35:25,673
Yes, sir.

1246
01:35:58,325 --> 01:36:01,205
Figueroa's broken through.

1247
01:36:01,205 --> 01:36:05,035
They're coming! Tanks!

1248
01:36:06,966 --> 01:36:10,806
Don't let Figueroa pass!
l'll hold the front.

1249
01:36:10,806 --> 01:36:14,635
- What about the prisoners?
- I'll take care of them.

1250
01:36:16,566 --> 01:36:20,406
My 120's fucked up.

1251
01:36:20,406 --> 01:36:22,326
Tanks?

1252
01:36:22,326 --> 01:36:23,286
Panhards.

1253
01:36:23,286 --> 01:36:25,206
Shit!

1254
01:36:25,206 --> 01:36:29,036
Can you lay two more rolls
of Tri-X on me?

1255
01:36:41,527 --> 01:36:45,357
No pictures.

1256
01:36:47,288 --> 01:36:49,208
Is this your justice?

1257
01:36:49,208 --> 01:36:52,088
It's necessary.
Get them out of here.

1258
01:36:52,088 --> 01:36:54,008
You've become just like them!

1259
01:36:54,008 --> 01:36:56,888
This is war! You don't have
the stomach for it...

1260
01:36:56,888 --> 01:37:00,718
...get out!

1261
01:37:06,489 --> 01:37:10,318
You've become just like them.

1262
01:39:18,016 --> 01:39:21,845
Oh, fucker! Fucker!

1263
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:35,286
You believe this?

1264
01:39:43,937 --> 01:39:47,767
John, no!

1265
01:39:48,737 --> 01:39:52,567
John!

1266
01:40:07,938 --> 01:40:08,898
Oh, Jesus, God.

1267
01:40:08,898 --> 01:40:10,819
Oh, God, John.

1268
01:40:10,819 --> 01:40:14,648
Why'd you want to put your...

1269
01:40:19,459 --> 01:40:20,419
Don't move.

1270
01:40:20,419 --> 01:40:24,249
Don't move.

1271
01:40:30,020 --> 01:40:31,940
Breathe out.

1272
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:33,860
Breathe out.

1273
01:40:33,860 --> 01:40:34,820
Can you breathe?

1274
01:40:34,820 --> 01:40:37,700
Can you breathe?

1275
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:41,530
Can you breathe?

1276
01:40:46,340 --> 01:40:49,221
I got the shot, Boyle.

1277
01:40:49,221 --> 01:40:52,101
You got the shot.

1278
01:40:52,101 --> 01:40:55,930
- Take it to New York.
- I'll get it to New York.

1279
01:41:08,422 --> 01:41:12,251
Got it.

1280
01:41:13,222 --> 01:41:17,062
Oh, Jesus, God.

1281
01:41:17,062 --> 01:41:19,942
You got the magic shot.

1282
01:41:19,942 --> 01:41:23,772
You got it. You're the best.

1283
01:41:29,543 --> 01:41:33,372
We fucked up, didn't we?

1284
01:41:51,624 --> 01:41:55,464
Don't wipe it on your thing,
clean it!

1285
01:41:55,464 --> 01:41:57,384
Rich, you okay?

1286
01:41:57,384 --> 01:41:59,304
Doc, give me a Valium, anything.

1287
01:41:59,304 --> 01:42:03,145
I got something for you.

1288
01:42:03,145 --> 01:42:05,065
- Here's two.
- Thank you.

1289
01:42:05,065 --> 01:42:07,945
Goddamn, that looks horrible.

1290
01:42:07,945 --> 01:42:10,825
Hey, hey! Where you going?

1291
01:42:10,825 --> 01:42:12,745
Where you going?

1292
01:42:12,745 --> 01:42:16,585
- Is it okay?
- It's all right. It'll be all right.

1293
01:42:16,585 --> 01:42:18,505
I got some good news for you.

1294
01:42:18,505 --> 01:42:21,385
Look, the bruja gave me some
cédulas for Maria and the kids.

1295
01:42:21,385 --> 01:42:23,306
She did a pretty good job.

1296
01:42:23,306 --> 01:42:27,135
And look, I got your exit visa
forged too.

1297
01:42:28,106 --> 01:42:31,946
She kind of fucked up on that,
but I think it's gonna be all right.

1298
01:42:31,946 --> 01:42:33,866
- Thank you.
- It'll work.

1299
01:42:33,866 --> 01:42:36,746
You gotta get out of here, man.

1300
01:42:36,746 --> 01:42:39,626
The police were over at Roberto's
looking for you.

1301
01:42:39,626 --> 01:42:41,547
They say you're
in the country illegally.

1302
01:42:41,547 --> 01:42:44,427
Roberto said he thinks you're dead.

1303
01:42:44,427 --> 01:42:48,256
You got to get out of here.

1304
01:42:56,907 --> 01:42:59,788
When we get there, hang back.

1305
01:42:59,788 --> 01:43:01,708
If there's any trouble, call Kelly.

1306
01:43:01,708 --> 01:43:04,588
If Kelly's gone, Morgan will help.
Got it?

1307
01:43:04,588 --> 01:43:07,468
I heard you the first time. I know.

1308
01:43:07,468 --> 01:43:09,388
Take care, don't stay here too long.

1309
01:43:09,388 --> 01:43:13,228
Don't become a Tic Tack monster.
They kill people here.

1310
01:43:13,228 --> 01:43:17,068
You believe everything
you read in the papers?

1311
01:43:17,068 --> 01:43:20,898
l'll miss you, Doc.

1312
01:43:21,869 --> 01:43:25,698
l'll miss you too.

1313
01:43:28,589 --> 01:43:29,549
Is that my watch?

1314
01:43:29,549 --> 01:43:32,429
Give it to me for the border.

1315
01:43:32,429 --> 01:43:35,309
Cheap son of a bitch.

1316
01:43:35,309 --> 01:43:39,139
Say hi to gringo-land for me,
all right?

1317
01:43:43,950 --> 01:43:47,780
You guys be careful.

1318
01:44:39,633 --> 01:44:43,473
It's fake.

1319
01:44:43,473 --> 01:44:47,313
Look, I'm not gonna bullshit you,
all right? Lt was a rush job.

1320
01:44:47,313 --> 01:44:51,153
I have to get to America.
I'm an important journalist.

1321
01:44:51,153 --> 01:44:53,074
Newsweek. Understand?

1322
01:44:53,074 --> 01:44:54,994
Newsweek. Time.

1323
01:44:54,994 --> 01:44:58,823
CBS. Big shot.

1324
01:45:05,554 --> 01:45:09,384
It's very important.

1325
01:45:12,275 --> 01:45:16,104
Where's he going?

1326
01:45:17,075 --> 01:45:18,995
Capital. You know... Oh, God.

1327
01:45:18,995 --> 01:45:21,875
I have a very important appointment
in the capital...

1328
01:45:21,875 --> 01:45:25,715
...with Ambassador Kelly
and Mr. Jose Duarte.

1329
01:45:25,715 --> 01:45:29,545
Why don't you hold that...

1330
01:45:54,517 --> 01:45:58,347
I'm a big fan
of the Raiders, actually.

1331
01:46:02,197 --> 01:46:06,027
The ambassador, you know?
United States Embassy.

1332
01:46:11,798 --> 01:46:14,678
I like the White Hand a lot.

1333
01:46:14,678 --> 01:46:18,508
Tremble, tremble, Communists,
with the instincts of animals...

1334
01:46:24,278 --> 01:46:28,119
The Mano Blanco doesn't hate you,
but you make trouble for Mr. Gomez.

1335
01:46:28,119 --> 01:46:30,999
Willie Gomez is a friend of mine.

1336
01:46:30,999 --> 01:46:34,828
That's why he wants you dead?

1337
01:46:46,360 --> 01:46:48,280
Oh, God, not that film!

1338
01:46:48,280 --> 01:46:52,109
That's the best war film of the year!

1339
01:46:54,040 --> 01:46:57,870
Cassady died getting it,
you motherfucker!

1340
01:46:58,840 --> 01:47:01,720
He died getting that film!

1341
01:47:01,720 --> 01:47:02,681
He died getting that film!

1342
01:47:02,681 --> 01:47:04,601
Fuck you! Fuck you, cocksuckers!

1343
01:47:04,601 --> 01:47:07,481
Boyle is about to fucking die.

1344
01:47:07,481 --> 01:47:08,441
And if he does, if he does...

1345
01:47:08,441 --> 01:47:12,270
...your next job will be in Rwanda
counting fucking spears, understand?!

1346
01:47:13,241 --> 01:47:17,071
Get the ambassador on the phone!

1347
01:47:56,443 --> 01:47:59,324
Okay, I'm not kidding.

1348
01:47:59,324 --> 01:48:03,164
I got $50,000 in traveler's checks.

1349
01:48:03,164 --> 01:48:07,004
They're hidden, like,
two kilometers from here.

1350
01:48:07,004 --> 01:48:09,884
You lie, you stupid gringo.

1351
01:48:09,884 --> 01:48:13,714
Don't castrate him in here.
You'll make a mess. Shoot him.

1352
01:48:24,285 --> 01:48:26,205
You tell General Martinez...

1353
01:48:26,205 --> 01:48:29,085
...that I am still the ambassador
to this country for another day.

1354
01:48:29,085 --> 01:48:31,965
I want those people out of there now...

1355
01:48:31,965 --> 01:48:35,795
...or l'll make it the worst day
of his fucking life. You got that?

1356
01:48:36,766 --> 01:48:40,606
Okay, fuck it.

1357
01:48:40,606 --> 01:48:44,435
Let's get it over with.

1358
01:48:52,126 --> 01:48:55,956
Are you kidding?

1359
01:49:29,568 --> 01:49:33,398
A little American trick here.

1360
01:49:37,249 --> 01:49:41,078
You know what that means?
You're all stupid cocksuckers.

1361
01:49:45,889 --> 01:49:49,729
I hope you get anal herpes.

1362
01:49:49,729 --> 01:49:51,650
Next?

1363
01:49:51,650 --> 01:49:52,610
Where've you been?

1364
01:49:52,610 --> 01:49:56,450
We just went to Nogales
for the afternoon with the family.

1365
01:49:56,450 --> 01:50:00,279
- Did you take the roast out?
- Yes, I took care of it.

1366
01:50:01,250 --> 01:50:04,130
When are we going to Disneyland?

1367
01:50:04,130 --> 01:50:07,970
I don't know, next month.
He's getting spoiled, I'm telling you.

1368
01:50:07,970 --> 01:50:11,800
- Okay. Next?
- Great. Thanks.

1369
01:50:13,731 --> 01:50:17,560
Come on.

1370
01:50:22,371 --> 01:50:25,251
I always dreamed
to come to California.

1371
01:50:25,251 --> 01:50:27,171
It's a wacko joint.

1372
01:50:27,171 --> 01:50:29,092
Not like El Salvador.

1373
01:50:29,092 --> 01:50:31,972
You can be what you want,
do what you want...

1374
01:50:31,972 --> 01:50:35,812
...as long as you got the money.

1375
01:50:35,812 --> 01:50:38,692
Maybe l'll get some of my
Salvador stories published.

1376
01:50:38,692 --> 01:50:41,572
I could write a story on John.

1377
01:50:41,572 --> 01:50:44,452
I think we're gonna be okay.

1378
01:50:44,452 --> 01:50:48,282
I think we're gonna be okay.

1379
01:50:50,213 --> 01:50:54,042
Why are we stopping here?

1380
01:51:01,733 --> 01:51:05,563
Please don't be alarmed,
just a routine lmmigration check.

1381
01:51:09,414 --> 01:51:10,374
May I see your I.D., sir?

1382
01:51:10,374 --> 01:51:13,254
Yeah, sure.
Will a driver's license do?

1383
01:51:13,254 --> 01:51:17,094
We just went to Nogales for the day.

1384
01:51:17,094 --> 01:51:19,014
Is that right? Are you his wife?

1385
01:51:19,014 --> 01:51:21,894
- What is he saying?
- Yes, she is. Is there a problem?

1386
01:51:21,894 --> 01:51:25,724
- May I see some identification?
- What is he saying?

1387
01:51:31,495 --> 01:51:35,325
What is the problem here?
Look, she's with me.

1388
01:51:36,295 --> 01:51:38,215
She's been through hell.

1389
01:51:38,215 --> 01:51:42,045
I'm a journalist, she's my researcher.
I don't understand the problem.

1390
01:51:43,015 --> 01:51:46,845
Come with me. Bring your children.

1391
01:51:52,616 --> 01:51:55,496
Wait a minute. What are you doing?

1392
01:51:55,496 --> 01:51:57,416
Sit down, sir, please.

1393
01:51:57,416 --> 01:51:59,336
- Wait a minute.
- Hey, sit down.

1394
01:51:59,336 --> 01:52:01,256
l'll sit down, but she's...

1395
01:52:01,256 --> 01:52:05,086
Richard, stop it. I go.

1396
01:52:06,057 --> 01:52:07,977
- But Maria, wait.
- I go. I be all right.

1397
01:52:07,977 --> 01:52:11,806
Just take care of yourself.

1398
01:52:15,657 --> 01:52:19,497
If you send her back, they will
kill her, rape her and mutilate her.

1399
01:52:19,497 --> 01:52:21,418
If you send her back there...

1400
01:52:21,418 --> 01:52:24,298
If you send the kids,
they'll kill them.

1401
01:52:24,298 --> 01:52:26,218
You don't know what it's like!

1402
01:52:26,218 --> 01:52:30,058
- You're under arrest.
- You have no idea what it's like!

1403
01:52:30,058 --> 01:52:33,888
- Move it!
- You have no idea!

1404
01:52:41,579 --> 01:52:43,499
Check point.

1405
01:52:43,499 --> 01:52:46,379
Three illegals. One female Latino...

1406
01:52:46,379 --> 01:52:47,339
...and two children.

1407
01:52:47,339 --> 01:52:51,169
Bringing them in.

1408
01:52:53,099 --> 01:52:55,979

01:52:59,820 --> 01:53:03,649
