1
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:55,166
- Hurry up, girls.
- Nearly ready.

2
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:56,835
You have too much
metal on you.

3
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,400
It's not so much.

4
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,537
I'm a magistrate,
not King of Asia.

5
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,980
Give one
to your sister.

6
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,984
Give one to your sister!

7
00:03:06,419 --> 00:03:08,785
Will you stop fussing
and put that veil on, please?

8
00:03:08,821 --> 00:03:10,288
We're going to be late.

9
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:18,023
Patron, I kiss you.

10
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,895
Mabinio, you honor me.
What do you want?

11
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:23,664
I um... well, I'll go
straight at it then.

12
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,570
My piss pots were all broken
this past nine day.

13
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:29,268
- Oh?
- Soldiers, naming no legions,

14
00:03:29,309 --> 00:03:32,472
thought it funny to tip them
out over the heads of honest citizens.

15
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:36,539
Now now, who's to say
it were soldiers?

16
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,245
Might have been
gladiators simulating.

17
00:03:39,285 --> 00:03:41,276
I know soldiers
when I see 'em...

18
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,016
not as I'm prejudiced.

19
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,354
Most soldiers are
good men like yourself.

20
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,791
But there's a lot of a foreign
element these days...

21
00:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,455
- It won't happen again.
- I should hope not.

22
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:53,124
Roman citizens that
need and deserve respect

23
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:55,532
are getting drenched
in piss instead!

24
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:57,126
There's not
a drop left!

25
00:03:57,170 --> 00:04:00,162
How am I to make
cloth without piss?

26
00:04:00,206 --> 00:04:03,972
- How am I supposed to make...
- It won't happen again.

27
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:07,970
Thank you, Patron.

28
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:09,447
Minerva keep you.

29
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,618
Brother Mascius.

30
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:16,246
Ah, Brother Vorenus.

31
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,587
Big man now, eh?

32
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,320
You're not so small.

33
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,884
Ah... these
Roman bitches.

34
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,056
I've done nothing but fuck
and eat and fuck since I got here.

35
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:28,657
We're not under
goatskin now, brother.

36
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:31,067
No disrespect
to your women, huh?

37
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:34,966
I am pleased to speak
with you more, Mascius,

38
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,033
but I must see
to my clients first.

39
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,806
And they are upset if not
received in their proper order.

40
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,974
Of course, of course.

41
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:47,180
Excuse my crude
soldier's ways.

42
00:04:58,197 --> 00:05:00,597
What brings you here,
Mascius?

43
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,328
Oh, just seeing
how you do...

44
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:04,802
which is good,
looks like.

45
00:05:04,837 --> 00:05:06,828
But where's that
old Titus Pullo?

46
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,431
I don't know.
I haven't seen him.

47
00:05:08,474 --> 00:05:09,907
Gerrae!

48
00:05:09,942 --> 00:05:12,103
You and Pullo were
like Castor and Pollux.

49
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:13,578
Pullo's dead to me.

50
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:19,576
Well, I'm glad to see
you're doing so good.

51
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,554
- How's our old chief then, eh?
- He is well.

52
00:05:31,597 --> 00:05:33,622
Good good.

53
00:05:35,101 --> 00:05:36,796
I'll not lie,

54
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:39,600
your brothers are unhappy,
very unhappy.

55
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:42,073
They feel the old chief's
forgot who brung him here.

56
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:45,043
They cannot have more coin.
There is an agreement.

57
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:47,103
Ay, there is.
There is.

58
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,977
And it's adequate coin.

59
00:05:50,316 --> 00:05:52,716
Got his picture on it
now I see.

60
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:54,515
A coiner may depict
what he likes.

61
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:57,182
Fact is, our brothers
need more than just money

62
00:05:57,223 --> 00:06:00,124
if they're to lead honorable
and peaceful lives.

63
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,389
Money runs out one day,
then what do they do?

64
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:03,690
What?

65
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,994
They need to take up
a trade maybe?

66
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,296
It's unlikely.
What are they to do?

67
00:06:08,334 --> 00:06:11,895
Do not pose questions
at me, brother. Speak directly.

68
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,463
We want land in Italy.

69
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,374
Caesar will give all
veterans land when he can

70
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:19,344
as he promised he would,
but not in Italy.

71
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,813
Caesar gave you
land in Italy.

72
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,146
I am a magistrate,
and he must have an income.

73
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,913
But I am one man,
not legions.

74
00:06:26,953 --> 00:06:29,786
Must be lovely.

75
00:06:29,822 --> 00:06:32,518
I haven't seen it yet.
I'm too busy.

76
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:35,584
Of course.
Busy busy.

77
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,857
- We don't want to be unreasonable...
- Then don't be.

78
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,300
We have an agreement.

79
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:49,868
Talk it over
with your man.

80
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,173
- Mars and Bellona keep you.
- And you.

81
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,573
Cavi, Chief.

82
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:01,671
Salve, Pullo.

83
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,775
How goes it?

84
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:09,587
Want some mouse?

85
00:08:09,622 --> 00:08:11,817
You should.
They do 'em savory here.

86
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:13,587
Best mouse
in the city.

87
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:17,426
So... do you have
some work for me?

88
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:19,761
Always somebody
needs mortality.

89
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,289
Give me a name.

90
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,531
Trouble is, my honey,
you want discretion.

91
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,162
This last job?

92
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,571
You ran that poor scurra
up and down the Aventine

93
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,202
like Justice
chasing chickens.

94
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,838
Might as well have
done it in the Forum.

95
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,041
- I'll go quiet next time.
- I don't know.

96
00:08:36,082 --> 00:08:38,073
I've my reputation
to think of.

97
00:08:38,117 --> 00:08:40,551
People come to me
for their mortality work

98
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:42,679
- because they know my men are reliable.
- That's right.

99
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,155
Reliable men.

100
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,658
I'll be quiet
as death next time.

101
00:08:49,695 --> 00:08:51,788
Come back tomorrow,
same time.

102
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,526
Urbo will take you
to your man.

103
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:58,403
Give me some money
on spec.

104
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,947
Not here.

105
00:09:14,687 --> 00:09:19,124
This is a respectable place
for decent citizens.

106
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:22,856
What would they have me do?

107
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,159
I cannot make farmland.

108
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:27,791
Certainly you can.
It's called eviction.

109
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,892
- And who shall I evict?
- Your enemies.

110
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:33,201
- Enemies? I have enemies still?
- Strange to say.

111
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:35,036
I shall make friends
of them in time.

112
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:38,908
And make enemies of your veterans...
unless something is done.

113
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,379
Is it possible
they turn on me?

114
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:43,848
They would never
fight against you,

115
00:09:43,883 --> 00:09:45,851
but if they're
not satisfied

116
00:09:45,885 --> 00:09:48,285
they will turn
to banditry and raiding.

117
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:50,687
In your name.
Not good.

118
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,557
Tell Mascius

119
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,290
I respect his honesty.

120
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:01,027
Tell him my veterans
are as sons to me,

121
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:05,128
and to all loyal veterans
I shall give good lands in...

122
00:10:06,238 --> 00:10:09,730
Pannonia.
Good fertile bottomlands.

123
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:13,336
- Pannonia?
- Speak freely.

124
00:10:13,379 --> 00:10:16,906
It's hard country,
Pannonia, and far away.

125
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:18,917
Mascius will refuse it.

126
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:21,419
Does Mascius have
the men's full trust?

127
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:23,513
Can he sway them
either way?

128
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:27,788
He can sway the 10th men, and what
the 10th men do will sway other legions.

129
00:10:27,827 --> 00:10:30,455
Make him
a personal offer then.

130
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,456
- To what limit?
- You be judge of that.

131
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:38,795
Oh, Magistrate Vorenus...

132
00:10:38,838 --> 00:10:41,966
my niece is holding
a symposium next market day

133
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:45,444
and I should like you and your wife
to come as my guests.

134
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,070
We are honored, sir.

135
00:10:47,113 --> 00:10:49,604
You look troubled.

136
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:53,278
My wife and I
are simple people, sir.

137
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,652
No matter. You shall get
used to good society.

138
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,404
How is it?

139
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:20,571
Much more comfortable.

140
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:24,515
I don't think my back could take
another of Cicero's eulogies.

141
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:27,610
No, he praises you
so long and high,

142
00:11:27,653 --> 00:11:30,713
one might think
he was being sincere.

143
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:37,993
- Salve, Magistrate.
- Salve, citizen.

144
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,527
My husband is home.

145
00:11:42,568 --> 00:11:44,502
It was so good
of you to visit.

146
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:47,700
Oh. Not at all,
I'm sure.

147
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,005
Please come again. I'd be
so happy to receive you.

148
00:11:55,081 --> 00:11:57,345
Thank you.

149
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:02,148
Desist
that now.

150
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:06,057
Receive us,
she says.

151
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:08,390
- I would...
- Ladies.

152
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:11,123
Magistrate, sir.

153
00:12:15,101 --> 00:12:17,535
- Husband...
- What are these now?

154
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,164
Leased, and at
very good rates too.

155
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:21,798
And don't they
look impressive?

156
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:24,309
Put some more
cloth on 'em.

157
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:26,504
You look tired.

158
00:12:26,545 --> 00:12:28,274
Why don't you
lie down?

159
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:29,838
I wish I could.

160
00:12:34,487 --> 00:12:37,047
"By claim of the Senate
and people,

161
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:41,150
our beloved Father,
Gaius Julius Caesar,

162
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,720
has been declared
Dictator for life.

163
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:49,259
Furthermore,
the fifth month is

164
00:12:49,301 --> 00:12:52,759
henceforth name
July in his honor."

165
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:00,736
Erase that.

166
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,706
Cassius.

167
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:09,047
It will do no good. The image
is on every wall, on every hill.

168
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:11,022
Don't worry about
those scribbles.

169
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:13,183
King Caesar knows
you're his loyal friend.

170
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:15,159
Oh, I'm not worried
about that.

171
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:17,992
No, it's just,
do I truly look like that?

172
00:13:18,030 --> 00:13:19,793
It's near.

173
00:13:19,832 --> 00:13:22,926
- Well, how tragic.
- Hmm.

174
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:25,903
But an image
cannot catch your vim,

175
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:27,906
your noble vitality.

176
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,737
I speak only what's true.

177
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,835
You have that grace in action
they say your noble ancestor had.

178
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,743
That's why plebs
put you on the walls.

179
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:37,772
- They see him in you.
- They see my wretched name, that's all.

180
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,752
Simpletons. Let us
speak of something else.

181
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:42,686
There's weight in names,
isn't there?

182
00:13:42,721 --> 00:13:46,851
You may call a cat a fish,
but it will not swim.

183
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:52,423
The plebs love liberty.
In your name they...

184
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:55,024
They would not pluck
a hair for liberty.

185
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,092
Plebs like to see
their betters fight.

186
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,661
It's cheaper than theater
and the blood is real.

187
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,401
Come, come here
with me.

188
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,975
Look now.
Look at that.

189
00:14:11,483 --> 00:14:13,314
It is a chair.
What of it?

190
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,820
Chair?
It's a throne!

191
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:19,985
I believe thrones are
generally more decorative.

192
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:22,823
That is decidedly plain
and chairlike.

193
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,887
- Are you blind?
- Do not become hysterical.

194
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:26,898
Your mother said you were
a coward. I begin to believe her.

195
00:14:26,932 --> 00:14:29,196
My mother is very unhappy.

196
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:32,203
Forgive me.
I spoke in anger.

197
00:14:32,238 --> 00:14:36,265
I am no coward,
nor am I blind.

198
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,742
I know what Caesar is.

199
00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,972
I can see.

200
00:14:41,013 --> 00:14:43,447
But I have pledged
myself his friend...

201
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:45,746
no, I am his friend.

202
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:47,684
So for friendship

203
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,484
you would let
the Republic die?

204
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,752
I am just a man.

205
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,760
The life or death
of the Republic

206
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,489
is not in my hands!

207
00:14:57,529 --> 00:15:00,555
You are precisely wrong.

208
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:03,659
The Republic is
in your hands.

209
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:09,071
The people will not
accept a tyrant's death

210
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:10,871
unless a Brutus
holds the knife.

211
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:14,677
Now you have
gone too far.

212
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,882
He has to die.

213
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:21,284
You know him. You know
he'd never accept exile.

214
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:23,550
He has to die.

215
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:35,098
Wait, friend.

216
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:36,931
Wait!

217
00:15:45,744 --> 00:15:48,235
Shh.

218
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,018
How's that
Gaulish cunny then?

219
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,649
Greasy I bet.

220
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,023
Don't talk
unless I tell you.

221
00:16:05,664 --> 00:16:08,189
There, in the middle.
Aufidius.

222
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:26,015
Murderer! Murderer!

223
00:16:26,051 --> 00:16:27,848
Murderer!

224
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,756
Murderer! Murderer!

225
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:36,559
Murderer!
Murderer!

226
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,460
He killed Aufidiu!

227
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,700
Murderer!
He killed Aufidiu!

228
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:56,472
Aufidiu. He killed Aufidiu!
Murderer!

229
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:59,643
Murderer! He killed Aufidiu!

230
00:17:16,869 --> 00:17:18,427
Pannonia?

231
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:20,529
Pannonia is
900 miles away.

232
00:17:20,572 --> 00:17:22,335
More like 600.

233
00:17:22,374 --> 00:17:25,366
In Germania practically.
It's not even provinced.

234
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,038
Soil's black
and deep they say.

235
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,706
Tall forests,
full of game.

236
00:17:28,747 --> 00:17:31,910
Full of Teuton raiders and
Dacian bandits and who knows who?

237
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:34,282
Our brothers don't want
any more fighting.

238
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,184
They won't have it.

239
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,189
If our brothers
accept Pannonia,

240
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,487
Caesar will be
extremely grateful to you.

241
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:43,586
- How so?
- 5,000 denarii.

242
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:47,326
- I don't understand you.
- I think you do.

243
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:50,699
I have been true to my brothers
since I first spilled blood.

244
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,603
You think I would betray them now
for 5,000 denarii?

245
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,369
- Seven then.
- It might be 20,000.

246
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,467
I am not
so greedy as some.

247
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:00,740
Not so greedy as who?

248
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,340
I merely say that my honor
is not for sale so cheap.

249
00:18:06,618 --> 00:18:09,815
In favoring Pannonia, you would not
betray our brothers.

250
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:13,256
If they will not have Pannonia,
they will have nothing.

251
00:18:13,292 --> 00:18:15,726
- Men with swords never starve.
- But they still die,

252
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,524
captains first.

253
00:18:25,070 --> 00:18:27,834
- 15.
- 10.

254
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,535
12.

255
00:18:32,511 --> 00:18:34,342
12.

256
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:48,618
I'll be away then,
brother.

257
00:18:49,995 --> 00:18:51,724
Good to see you.

258
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,095
And you.

259
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:00,633
- Has that man gone?
- He has.

260
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,137
- Is this all right?
- You look beautiful.

261
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:14,115
I'm so scared
I can hardly breathe.

262
00:19:15,854 --> 00:19:17,515
It will be fine.

263
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:19,888
My dear girl, I have enough
to worry about.

264
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,916
I will not be fearful
of graffiti.

265
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,394
I'm telling you, the scribblers
are not wrong.

266
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:26,488
Brutus will betray you.

267
00:19:26,532 --> 00:19:27,931
You seem very sure.

268
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,695
His mother
will compel him.

269
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,635
She will not rest
until you are dead.

270
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,639
I well imagine poor Servilia
is not very fond of me,

271
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,698
but really,
wants me dead?

272
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,006
Atia, you're
a dramatist.

273
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:41,478
Well, I've warned you.
I'll say no more.

274
00:19:43,048 --> 00:19:45,312
I've warned him.

275
00:19:46,552 --> 00:19:48,645
You're far away.

276
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:53,255
Somewhere pleasant,
I hope.

277
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:57,023
- It's all one.
- So they tell me.

278
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,999
I need your help.

279
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:05,830
Your mother is a vicious
and heartless creature,

280
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,533
but I find I am

281
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:11,839
wretched without her.

282
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,606
I have done my best
to sway her,

283
00:20:13,645 --> 00:20:18,105
but still she shuns me
like a leper.

284
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,550
Refuses even
to speak to me.

285
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:24,713
Will you talk
to her for me?

286
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:29,318
Let her know how
pitiful I have become?

287
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:33,959
There's no need.

288
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,763
Her disdain for you
is an act.

289
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:39,771
She is entirely
infatuated with you.

290
00:20:39,805 --> 00:20:42,330
That is a wicked,
foolish lie!

291
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:44,604
Atia, you let me
speak with you...

292
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:47,737
Daughter, that creature over there
by the door, who is she?

293
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,043
The beauty
in the vulgar dress?

294
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:52,448
She's with
Lucius Vorenus.

295
00:20:52,484 --> 00:20:54,008
His wife I expect.

296
00:20:54,052 --> 00:20:56,680
It's so beautiful.

297
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:59,316
They've even painted
the ceiling.

298
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:01,883
She has a wonderful tang
of the street about her.

299
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:04,623
Let me introduce you.

300
00:21:04,663 --> 00:21:06,824
- Maybe we should walk around.
- No, we should wait.

301
00:21:06,865 --> 00:21:08,560
- They're coming towards us.
- Calm calm.

302
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,433
Magistrate,
my niece would like

303
00:21:11,470 --> 00:21:14,701
- to meet your lovely wife.
- Honored.

304
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,867
Niobe, Atia.

305
00:21:16,908 --> 00:21:19,877
How did a grim thing like you
win such a flower?

306
00:21:19,911 --> 00:21:22,209
I found her when she
was still young and foolish.

307
00:21:24,349 --> 00:21:26,249
Perhaps you will
entertain Niobe

308
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,753
while I speak with
her fortunate husband?

309
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,414
Delighted.

310
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:33,754
Now, tell me,
who on Gaia's earth

311
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,090
- made this astonishing dress?
- I did.

312
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,858
- You didn't.
- I did.

313
00:21:38,897 --> 00:21:42,594
So... what does
Mascius say?

314
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:45,194
He will accept
Pannonia for 12.

315
00:21:45,237 --> 00:21:47,296
Very good.

316
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:50,240
I did not think he would
sell himself so cheap.

317
00:21:50,275 --> 00:21:53,733
I must send you to negotiate
all my corruptions.

318
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:56,509
I would rather not, sir.

319
00:21:56,548 --> 00:21:58,914
I spoke in jest.

320
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:01,384
I understand.

321
00:22:01,420 --> 00:22:03,388
Please.

322
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,821
You have corrupted
one man

323
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:11,795
and saved thousands
from banditry.

324
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,128
I often wish I were
back in Gaul.

325
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,760
There is something pleasingly
simple about warfare.

326
00:22:16,802 --> 00:22:20,135
- Vorenus...
- Magistrate Vorenus, if you please.

327
00:22:20,172 --> 00:22:22,163
He outranks you now,
my boy.

328
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,438
Excuse me,
Magistrate Vorenus.

329
00:22:25,477 --> 00:22:27,445
I hear rumor
among the servants

330
00:22:27,479 --> 00:22:29,276
that Titus Pullo
is in the dungeons

331
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:31,805
awaiting trial for murder.
Is it true?

332
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,410
It is.

333
00:22:34,453 --> 00:22:37,081
He has been hiring himself out
as a knifeman.

334
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:39,056
He killed a man
in broad daylight.

335
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,888
We must do
something for him.

336
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,451
We must do nothing.

337
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,463
- Nothing?
- The man he killed

338
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,158
was Aufidius Dento,

339
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,895
Deputy Chief of
the Caelian Nailmaker's Association.

340
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:53,029
Popular man, apparently,
and a vocal critic of my leadership.

341
00:22:53,071 --> 00:22:56,632
People will suspect
I ordered his death.

342
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:59,940
I must not confirm
those suspicions by helping Pullo.

343
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:02,640
And did you...

344
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:04,273
order his death?

345
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:07,308
I did not know he existed
until he didn't.

346
00:23:07,352 --> 00:23:10,116
I have no notion
why he was killed.

347
00:23:10,155 --> 00:23:13,056
Public man like that,
might be many reasons.

348
00:23:13,091 --> 00:23:15,457
I can't appear to be
sending out my soldiers

349
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:17,462
to murder anyone
who opposes me.

350
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,464
I would lose support
of the plebeians...

351
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:21,227
Perhaps Vorenus and I
might be able to...

352
00:23:21,266 --> 00:23:24,360
...nor can anyone
associated with me help him.

353
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,166
Has he any friends?

354
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:28,468
Who will help him find
a lawyer to defend him?

355
00:23:28,507 --> 00:23:30,873
He is guilty.

356
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,571
People must see
justice done.

357
00:23:33,612 --> 00:23:35,671
Soldiers have to learn
they're not above law.

358
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:38,274
I'm sorry, Vorenus.
I know he is brother to you,

359
00:23:38,316 --> 00:23:40,284
but there is no choice.

360
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:45,051
It's all true.

361
00:23:51,963 --> 00:23:53,794
I think we can
go now unless you...

362
00:23:53,832 --> 00:23:57,290
Can we? This is
very nice, but...

363
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,895
I know.

364
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:16,417
Castor...
in the morning,

365
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,320
bring Timon
the Jew here.

366
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,923
Good night, Mother.

367
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,793
Good night, my love.

368
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:25,217
I don't see
what's wrong with it.

369
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:21,905
Oh, Moses,
you need law?

370
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:24,313
Number one justice
right here! Right here!

371
00:26:24,349 --> 00:26:27,045
Take me, boss! Top lawyer!
Top lawyer!

372
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:29,178
- You're good are you?
- Good?

373
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,747
I could have Medea acquitted. What's your
case?

374
00:26:32,791 --> 00:26:35,988
Man, name of
Titus Pullo...

375
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,962
- On your way, Jew.
- You don't want the case?

376
00:26:38,997 --> 00:26:41,864
I'd rather suck
Pluto's thorny cock.

377
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,336
Anyone?

378
00:26:48,006 --> 00:26:50,702
Anyone want work?

379
00:26:55,246 --> 00:26:56,975
Anyone?

380
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:14,524
It would go
much easier for you

381
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:16,261
if you said who it was
that paid you.

382
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,201
It-it shows penitence.

383
00:27:18,236 --> 00:27:19,999
I can't help you.
Sorry.

384
00:27:20,038 --> 00:27:21,767
I gave my word.

385
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:26,043
Perhaps you need the money
to help your sick mother

386
00:27:26,077 --> 00:27:28,341
or a friend in need?

387
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,780
Something like that
would help.

388
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,749
I needed money for wine.

389
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:40,587
Have... have you any friends
that would speak for you?

390
00:27:43,895 --> 00:27:46,420
There must be someone.

391
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,827
Good bread, this.
Have you got any more?

392
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:07,115
Titus Pullo, soldier,
13th Gallic Legion;

393
00:28:07,152 --> 00:28:09,620
Accused of homicide

394
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:12,817
re citizen Aufidius Dento,

395
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:15,587
Caelian Hill,
tribe of Falerna;

396
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:18,824
Brought to trial
by his friends.

397
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,025
We begin.

398
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:27,505
Who speaks
for the corpse

399
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,439
of Aufidius Dento?

400
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:33,774
I... Maius Nigidius.

401
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:40,039
Who speaks
for Titus Pullo?

402
00:28:40,085 --> 00:28:42,986
I- I...

403
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:47,253
Priscus Maevius.

404
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,988
Accusator, proceed.

405
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:53,225
Citizens,

406
00:28:53,264 --> 00:28:55,027
friends...

407
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:58,058
when I was told
of the death of Aufidiu,

408
00:28:58,103 --> 00:29:00,401
I was deeply saddened.

409
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:03,805
A good man, stabbed!
Butchered!

410
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:07,642
Hacked to death in daylight
on a public street!

411
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,283
I was deeply saddened.

412
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:14,285
But I was not surprised.

413
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:18,255
These horrors
have become commonplace.

414
00:29:18,289 --> 00:29:21,349
Wretched specimens
like this

415
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,758
are common as rats.

416
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:28,161
I will not take your time with
lengthy proof of his guilt.

417
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,565
Look at him!

418
00:29:30,602 --> 00:29:34,299
It's not open to question.
We all know he's guilty.

419
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:41,209
When I find a rat
in my cellar,

420
00:29:41,246 --> 00:29:45,342
I don't ask questions, I have
a slave squash him underfoot...

421
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:47,715
Salve, brother.

422
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,185
And to you, brother.

423
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:51,120
Not good, eh?

424
00:29:51,156 --> 00:29:53,420
What are you doing here? I thought
Pullo was dead to you?

425
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,289
Dead to all soon.

426
00:29:55,326 --> 00:29:56,918
Hard as adamant, you.

427
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,588
Well, you might
be wrong, though.

428
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,530
Many's the slip
'tween knife and altar.

429
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:03,398
- What?
- Pullo is not alone.

430
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:11,163
We'll not let any brother
be damned by this dirty mob.

431
00:30:11,209 --> 00:30:13,871
These dogs will be
yelping louder soon.

432
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:16,640
When they bring him
down off there,

433
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:18,581
we'll go in swinging
and have him away.

434
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,607
- Call them off!
- Eh? Why?

435
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:23,280
Do you not understand
what is at stake here?

436
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,289
- Brother Pullo's life.
- Politically.

437
00:30:25,323 --> 00:30:27,120
What is at stake
politically.

438
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,958
Politically. I fuck politically
in her fat ass.

439
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:33,293
If Pullo is rescued
by Caesar's men,

440
00:30:33,331 --> 00:30:36,061
people will assume that he
ordered Dento's killing

441
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,034
and Caesar will
be held responsible.

442
00:30:38,069 --> 00:30:39,832
And so? Caesar can
do as he likes.

443
00:30:39,871 --> 00:30:41,896
He is trying to
re-establish law and order.

444
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,908
That won't work
if his soldiers are seen

445
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,240
to be killing citizens
without consequence.

446
00:30:46,277 --> 00:30:47,972
Still. I can't call
the boys off now.

447
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,037
- Why not?
- Because it makes me look bad.

448
00:30:50,081 --> 00:30:52,242
You could look
far worse.

449
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:56,849
You will tell them?

450
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:01,085
I will if I have to.

451
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:06,323
Look at us, brother.

452
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,855
How has it come
to this?

453
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:14,002
It is for the good
of the Republic.

454
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,438
It's a worthy cause then.

455
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,840
Just call them off.

456
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,319
To add insult to injury,
this soldier,

457
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:38,819
this brute, this barbarian
from who knows where,

458
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,297
refuses to name
his paymaster!

459
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:42,993
Caesar! Caesar!

460
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:46,526
We name no names, Citizen.
We cannot know.

461
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,539
We might guess.

462
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,440
We might
very well guess,

463
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,444
but we cannot know.

464
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:56,447
Which makes his crime
even worse.

465
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:59,541
Is there punishment enough
for monsters such as this?

466
00:32:02,553 --> 00:32:06,546
I think not.
I think not.

467
00:32:07,625 --> 00:32:10,253
But perhaps
my learned friend

468
00:32:10,295 --> 00:32:12,695
can tell us otherwise.

469
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,391
Priscus Maevius speaks.

470
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:22,640
This-this man...

471
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:26,075
is nothing
but a helpless servant.

472
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:31,605
A tool, a puppet.

473
00:32:31,649 --> 00:32:34,914
We should feel pity,
not anger.

474
00:32:34,953 --> 00:32:36,921
Pity for his...

475
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:40,118
pity for
his degradation.

476
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:44,652
Wait. Do you
claim him innocent?

477
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:46,425
No, I'm simply
saying that...

478
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:49,365
Well if you do not deny his guilt,
then we're done with it.

479
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:53,200
- Do you deny his guilt?
- No, I do not sir.

480
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,728
Very well.
Titus Pullo

481
00:32:55,773 --> 00:32:59,470
condemned to death
in the arena.

482
00:33:11,122 --> 00:33:13,989
You know that I have always
looked on you as my son.

483
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:17,253
Oh dear, one of
those conversations.

484
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:20,822
Hmm, good move.

485
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:24,232
I have a favor
to ask of you, father to son.

486
00:33:24,268 --> 00:33:25,792
Oh?

487
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,805
I need someone
to take over Macedonia

488
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,865
from that idiot Valerius.

489
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:34,275
I would like
to appoint you.

490
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:36,439
I govern Macedonia?

491
00:33:36,481 --> 00:33:38,381
If you will accept.

492
00:33:38,416 --> 00:33:40,816
Why by three Furies would
you want me to govern Macedonia?

493
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,446
You are the right man
for the job.

494
00:33:43,488 --> 00:33:47,549
I can think of
few men less right.

495
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,789
Brutus, you've always underestimated
yourself.

496
00:33:50,828 --> 00:33:54,025
You might achieve great
things if you would but try.

497
00:33:54,065 --> 00:33:57,557
In Macedonia?

498
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,934
I think not.

499
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:06,808
I would ask you
to reconsider.

500
00:34:06,844 --> 00:34:09,108
I need someone
I can trust.

501
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:20,654
- You need me out of Rome?
- Not at all.

502
00:34:20,691 --> 00:34:22,852
I need your help.

503
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:27,395
Someone you can trust?

504
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,730
Am I wrong to do so?

505
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:32,258
- You have doubts, do you?
- I did not say that.

506
00:34:32,303 --> 00:34:33,861
Speak plain,
I beg you.

507
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,770
Have I given you
reason for doubt?

508
00:34:35,807 --> 00:34:39,573
Since you ask, you have
as you well know.

509
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:42,044
You speak of years ago.

510
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,708
Old betrayals
do not signify?

511
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:46,683
I betrayed nothing.

512
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:51,184
Had you told me
you were to march on Rome

513
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,918
and asked me
for my allegiance,

514
00:34:53,958 --> 00:34:56,085
I would have given it.

515
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:58,186
I would have
judged you insane...

516
00:34:59,997 --> 00:35:02,090
but I would have given
you my allegiance

517
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:03,930
because I look on you
as my father.

518
00:35:03,968 --> 00:35:07,961
- Brutus...
- But you did not ask for my allegiance.

519
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:10,940
You demanded it
at swordpoint.

520
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:13,136
I betrayed nothing!

521
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:15,008
Forgive me,
I spoke too hot.

522
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:18,641
You have never betrayed me.

523
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:21,811
- So why do you not trust me now?
- I trust you completely.

524
00:35:21,853 --> 00:35:23,912
So much so that you
would send me

525
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,788
from Rome
to govern Macedonia?

526
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:37,164
Well, thank you.

527
00:35:37,201 --> 00:35:40,932
I am honored,
but I will not go.

528
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:51,445
It is in my legal power
to insist that you do go.

529
00:35:52,717 --> 00:35:55,242
As my father,

530
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,551
as my father
I looked on you...

531
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,557
For a year or so,
no more.

532
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,525
Until the city
is stable.

533
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,425
Forgive me.
I feel unwell.

534
00:36:04,462 --> 00:36:06,191
Perhaps we can finish
this game another time...

535
00:36:06,230 --> 00:36:07,697
Be reasonable!

536
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:10,963
You're on every wall
with a knife at my throat!

537
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:13,266
I would be foolish
to ignore it.

538
00:36:13,304 --> 00:36:15,363
Only tyrants

539
00:36:15,406 --> 00:36:18,933
need worry about
tyrant killers.

540
00:36:18,976 --> 00:36:20,637
And you are no tyrant.

541
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,545
Haven't you told me
so many times?

542
00:36:23,581 --> 00:36:25,139
You may go.

543
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:57,678
Janus, Gaia and Dis...

544
00:36:59,317 --> 00:37:01,478
I humbly beg

545
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,249
you accept this creature
as my offering,

546
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:07,621
and if it pleases you...

547
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,796
I ask you to give
Eirene long life.

548
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:19,494
And same for my friend
Lucius Vorenus and his family,

549
00:37:19,537 --> 00:37:21,596
if it's not too much.

550
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:30,112
And let Eirene know

551
00:37:30,147 --> 00:37:32,877
that I am sorry
for what I did.

552
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:46,490
Come on, soldier, up!

553
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:57,158
Cavi with this one...

554
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,800
soldier.

555
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:20,515
Come on, coward!
Fight!

556
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:25,628
Stand up and fight.

557
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:27,722
I don't want to.

558
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:29,357
That's not how it works.

559
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,425
You're supposed to resist.

560
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:34,302
Not if I don't want to.

561
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:36,203
I just want to die,
all right?

562
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,902
So come ahead and kill me
and be done with it.

563
00:39:38,943 --> 00:39:41,138
Bollocks. Move!

564
00:39:41,178 --> 00:39:43,408
What's wrong with you?
Where's your dignity?

565
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:45,415
Get up and fight!

566
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,153
Hey, soldier.
Wake up!

567
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:55,420
Why don't you come here
and suck my cock?

568
00:39:55,459 --> 00:39:57,324
Look, just hold
your sword.

569
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,226
Just stand up and hold it,
that's all.

570
00:39:59,263 --> 00:40:00,958
You don't have to
run about or anything.

571
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:03,626
You're naught
but a bloody mollie.

572
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:07,865
You and the whole 13th!
Naught but bloody mollies.

573
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:10,100
Don't talk of the 13th.

574
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:15,341
Oh, eh?
I piss on the 13th!

575
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:17,939
Pig spawn,
all of em.

576
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:27,687
Why don't you and
the 13th all line up and suck my cock...

577
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:19,876
13!

578
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,939
13!

579
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:28,150
13!

580
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,617
13!

581
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:35,458
Heya!

582
00:42:42,159 --> 00:42:44,627
13!

583
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:46,021
13!

584
00:44:57,094 --> 00:45:00,495
Pullo! Pullo! Pullo...

585
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:13,466
- In autumn, they disappear.
- Who?

586
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,671
Eels, they all
disappear.

587
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,648
- That so?
- Where?

588
00:45:18,682 --> 00:45:20,513
- Where what?
- Well, where do they go?

589
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,314
- The eels?
- That's what I'm saying.

590
00:45:22,352 --> 00:45:25,150
Nobody knows.
It's a mystery.

591
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:33,527
Was expecting you time ago.

592
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:37,500
If we employ you again,
next time,

593
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:39,627
best not use veterans.

594
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:13,201
Mother?

595
00:46:13,237 --> 00:46:17,173
I owe Caesar
no more friendship.

596
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:18,834
I must do my duty.

597
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:41,825
I'll speak to Cassius.

598
00:46:42,833 --> 00:46:45,097
See what can be done.
