1
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,400
For Allied forces in the Gulf,

2
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:22,960
the preparation is over.
The real battle? Only days away.

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,840
This relentless activity is a reminder
that if final-hour diplomacy stumbles,

4
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:31,680
then action against Iraq will be both
certain and uncompromising.

5
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,520
Saddam Hussein says it will be
"The Mother of all Battles."

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:38,600
President Bush demanded that the
conflict must be swift and decisive.

7
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,080
This will not be another vietnam.

8
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,280
This will not be a protracted, drawn-out war.

9
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,720
Israel retained the right to defend itself

10
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,920
and would retaliate
if Iraq took any offensive action.

11
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:12,520
A Defence spokesman said Israeli
jets could be over Iraqi territory

12
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,000
within 20 minutes.

13
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,720
The UN Secretary-General said,

14
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,600
only God knows if there would be peace or war.

15
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,920
When I walk out of here, I want quiet!

16
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,920
- Fags, factor 20, bacon sandwich.
- Ta.

17
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:34,360
It's mine, it's mine, it's mine!

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,080
- This is for Kate's birthday.
- Yeah?

19
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,680
"Dearest Kate. I'm truly sorry
I can't be with you on your birthday."

20
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,160
Shit. Four years old.
I've missed every one of them.

21
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,800
# "Wow.! Allah.!"

22
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,880
"*Darling", "you've got to let me know"

23
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:06,560
# "Should I stay or should I go"

24
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:09,880
- Here you go.
- See you soon.

25
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,440
Give me a hug.

26
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,320
You take care of Mummy, OK?

27
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,800
You could always get that dog
you were talking about.

28
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Piss off, Andy.

29
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,320
See you when I see you.

30
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,920
- New boots?
- Aye. Gucci.

31
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,400
Very chic.

32
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,680
Image is very important, especially
when you're dealing with rag-heads.

33
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:16,840
Yeah. Watch your step, Chris.

34
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,800
# "Should I stay or should I go now"

35
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,160
# "If I go there will be trouble"

36
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,440
If anyone touches you while I'm away,

37
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,920
I'll knot their bollocks so tight,
they'll be pissing out their ears.

38
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,160
Hey, where's Tony?

39
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,560
Shit!

40
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,960
Bring my bergen, will you, mate?

41
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,640
# "Should I stay or should I go now"

42
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,120
{y: I}*Should I stay or should I go now

43
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,720
# "If I go there will be trouble"

44
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,040
Hello, mate!

45
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:17,000
All right, mate?

46
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,440
Mate! Easy!

47
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,440
- Room for a midget?
- NO!

48
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,000
- Where's his gear?
- Stan's got it.

49
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,200
- How do I look?
- "# Should I stay or should I go now.?"

50
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,040
"Every soldier"
{y: I}hopes for a major war in his lifetime.

51
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,400
{y: I}This one was mine.

52
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,360
The Scud missiles' launch platforms

53
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,960
will make them too difficult to
locate and attack, let alone destroy.

54
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,840
The attack on Tel Aviv

55
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,240
has not, so far, resulted in
any response from Israel

56
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,120
It's not yet been confirmed, but it
looks like all our tasking's changed

57
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,400
and it'll be against Scuds
since Israel has been taking hits.

58
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,000
A lot of pissed-off people in Tel Aviv.

59
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:50,320
- How long have we got?
- Three days, who knows?

60
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,520
Plenty of time.

61
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,200
Eat over there, shit over there,
sleep wherever you can find a space.

62
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,320
The MO's along the end of the track,
so don't forget to get your jabs.

63
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,080
- We got jack shit.
- Chris, this'll do.

64
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:15,640
- Hi, Ray.
- Oh, great, I've got the Kiwi

65
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,240
- What the hell is this?
- Lego.

66
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,320
Very thoughtful of you. Just what we needed.

67
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,680
Watch it! Jesus!

68
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,920
Sid's got a brew-up.

69
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,320
Great, lads, listen in.

70
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,120
I know it's a pain in the arse and not on.

71
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:53,880
This is your nuclear, biological
and chemical protection suit and bits.

72
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,040
Just think of it as a large condom with legs.

73
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,000
- What have we got here?
- Blankets, beds, Coke,

74
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,080
and most importantly of all soft toilet roll

75
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,720
- Did you see the doc?
- Yeah.

76
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,920
- Jabs?
- No. I did get some morphine, though.

77
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,120
There's two apiece.

78
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:31,760
Seven across: "Turncoats
for the opera". Five letters.

79
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,680
It's a crossword clue.

80
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,600
{y: I}That night we had our first attack.

81
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,120
- What's the score on the jabs, mate?
- Stan says: "No jabs".

82
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,040
I asked them if these suits worked.
He said: "Whatever turns you on."

83
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,600
Don't fart in it, it's fatal

84
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,120
Can you get two into one suit?

85
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:06,480
- For what, mate?
- Fun. You feel lonely in here.

86
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,240
Looks like TV to me.

87
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,880
What are you thinking?

88
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,360
Seven across: "Turncoats for the opera".

89
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,720
Andy!

90
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:27,040
Warning order. Eight-man patrol
You command, Ray will be 2 i/c.

91
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:29,640
You will be cutting a communications line.

92
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,640
No move for three days.
Briefing at 0800 tomorrow.

93
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,320
Okay, boss.

94
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,160
It's not too clever staying up here.

95
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,320
I don't want to lose you in some bone incident.

96
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,160
OK, let's get on with it. As you
know, your task is against Scud.

97
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,120
Ground: Northwest of Baghdad.

98
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,560
Your area of concern will be
this northern main supply route.

99
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,880
The Scuds landing in Israel
are causing the alliance problems.

100
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:14,520
Two nights ago,
the Israeli air force was in the air

101
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,640
waiting to attack targets inside Iraq.

102
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,480
If Israeljoins in the war,

103
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,160
the alliance with the Arab states will crumble,

104
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,360
which, of course, is what Iraq wants.

105
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,480
But if the Scud attacks on Israel
don't stop within two weeks,

106
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,160
Israel willjoin the war. We're not
concerned about the fixed silos.

107
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,320
Air strikes are taking care of those.

108
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,560
The mobile launchers are a different matter.

109
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,480
They're almost impossible to locate,
but they have one weakness:

110
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,560
To programme in their targets,
they need assistance from Baghdad.

111
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:45,400
This information is fed
through fibre-optic cables

112
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,960
buried along the MSRs between
Baghdad and the border towns.

113
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:52,040
Cut those cables and they can't fly.

114
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:54,560
Missión in two parts:

115
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,040
One, locate and destroy the fibre-
optic cable along the northern MSR;

116
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,360
two, destroy mobile Scud.

117
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:06,800
Repeat: One, locate and destroy
the fibre-optic cable

118
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,520
along the northern MSR;

119
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,880
two, destroy mobile Scud. Any questions?

120
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:20,600
This terrain's crap. It's like a billiard table.

121
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,360
How the hell are we going to
find a hide in that?

122
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,320
- Maps?
- One in a million.

123
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,160
Air navigation, otherwise jack shit.

124
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,360
- If we get better, they're yours.
- Shit.

125
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,200
Wind your neck in, Chris.
This is what it's all about, mate.

126
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,120
Getting on with what you've got.

127
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,920
- So how are we getting in?
- There's no point taking vehicles.

128
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,720
We'lljust stick out like a bulldog's bollocks.

129
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,480
Looks like a heli drop-off.

130
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,640
Give Harry and his crew a warning order.

131
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:50,960
If we're going to find the cable, we
have to hit the MSR at its narrowest.

132
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,880
That'll be at a bend. Everybody cuts
corners, what about here?

133
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,600
Shouldn't be any military activity whatsoever.

134
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,360
Just be aware of the airfield in the southwest.

135
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,440
No population. Looks good to me.

136
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,320
- Weather?
- Much like a spring day in the UK.

137
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,440
Are the cables above ground or buried in pipes?

138
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,160
Don't know yet.
We're waiting for more intelligence.

139
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,240
Will we need to use plastic explosives,

140
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,160
or do we give them a tap with a hammer?

141
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,440
A boy in D Squadron used to lay
fibre optics for a telecom company.

142
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,200
I'll see if he knows the score.

143
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,960
Once we cut the lines,
someone will renew them.

144
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,680
Exactly. If you can take them out,
it will slow down the repair time.

145
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,160
- Great.
- We'll be operating here,

146
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,880
around 178K from the Syrian border.

147
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,400
It's more than twice that far
to Saudi. We'll infill by heli.

148
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:42,360
Our drop-off point being
around 20K south of the MSR.

149
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:45,400
From there, move north to the MSR

150
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,360
and find a hide in the area of this bend.

151
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,560
Once in position, find a cable

152
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:57,000
and place the charges on staggered
timings along a 3-4K length.

153
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,960
If we get into any shit,
we call AWACS on the TACBEs.

154
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,480
Get some air support
while we wait for the heli pick-up.

155
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:06,920
If that doesn't happen, tab to Syria.

156
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:10,200
OK.

157
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,160
- What do you want TACBEs for?
- To order pizza. I need eight.

158
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,800
Eight? You work in pairs, don't you?

159
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,680
- OK, four.
- Four TACBEs.

160
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,640
They're to call in air support, you understand?

161
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,080
- Yeah.
- They're not for any other purpose.

162
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:26,520
- Right. What's this?
- That is a shiny thing.

163
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,840
- But I want one.
- You don't know what it does.

164
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,600
As much link as we can carry
for the Minimis and 5.56 for the 203s.

165
00:12:35,800 --> 00:12:38,480
What's your score
with the 203 bombs and claymores?

166
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:40,400
Are you out of your skulls?

167
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,080
The Regiment hasn't been together
since Worid War II.

168
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,880
We're not scaled up for this. We're skint.

169
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,880
- Whose is all this?
- It's A and D Squadrons'.

170
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,000
We're operational in three days.

171
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,320
So are they. You don't even have a job, yet.

172
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:55,080
Why bring us out if you haven't got any kit?

173
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,960
Ray, find some claymores and 203 bombs,

174
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,480
and take Chris with you.

175
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,800
Cyril, have a word with the other squadrons.

176
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,800
- See if you can get some gear.
- Ha!

177
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:28,720
"Dearest Jilly. If you're reading this, I'm dead."

178
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:32,440
"Don't mope around. Get the insurance
money and have a good time."

179
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,560
"PS Don't forget 500 pounds
is for the next squadron piss-up."

180
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,600
"PPS I love you."

181
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,760
- Are those the TACBEs?
- Yeah. There's only one between two.

182
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,880
- Have you tested the 319?
- No, I'll test it tomorrow.

183
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,320
We've got our call sign - Bravo Two Zero.

184
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,600
Sounds good to me. I like
the easy-to-remember ones.

185
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:18,240
Doesn't get any easier, does it?

186
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,120
No.

187
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:26,160
- What's that shiny thing?
- It's a SatNav.

188
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:31,040
Put it on the list, mate. Mark can have it.

189
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:32,960
Yeah.

190
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,000
Well seeing as you've got no brew left, I'm off.

191
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:56,560
"Dearest Kate. My dearest, dearest shiny thing."

192
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,160
"This is a letter I've never wanted to write."

193
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,400
"Or you to read."

194
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,560
"Here we check"- "zeroed"
{y: I}the Minimis and 203s.

195
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,040
{y: I}Weapons are just a tool

196
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,360
{y: I}So long as they go bang and hit
"what you're aiming at", "that'll do."

197
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:54,920
- Nice to have known you, wankers.
- And you, dickheads.

198
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,400
"The kit's divided equally",
"so if anything goes wrong",

199
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,520
{y: I}any two of us can carry out
{y: I}the task with some success.

200
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,440
"We only took the essentials", "but"
"even that added up to 209lbs each",

201
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,160
{y: I}the weight of a 15 stone man.

202
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,080
- How does it fee"I?"
- Bloody hell!

203
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:14,160
How far have we got to tab with this?

204
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,440
Right, gents. Listen up.

205
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,080
Sort out your kit and bag it up.

206
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,920
Next of kin, one bag. Squadron, another.

207
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:27,000
Remember to label which is which.

208
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,640
Don't want your parents knowing
you wear stockings and suspenders

209
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:32,160
every chance you get, do we?

210
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,720
Last Supper's around six.

211
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,880
We might be getting some
fresh in, especially for you.

212
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,920
Why don't we stuff them all
in bin-liners and take them with us?

213
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,000
We're not a bunch of new age trave"lle"rs.

214
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,920
It's always a question of style with you.

215
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,040
- You are what you wear.
- And what you carry.

216
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,240
Everything goes into the bergens
except for the NBC kit,

217
00:16:55,440 --> 00:17:00,040
which, in deference to Chris, we will
carry in these designer sandbags.

218
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,080
Right, anything we've forgotten?

219
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,600
Aye. Cover story. There's a high
chance of dipping out on this one.

220
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,200
The obvious one is pilot rescue.

221
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,800
We're a search team looking for downed pilots,

222
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,280
- and our own heli went down.
- Sounds good.

223
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,400
- You want a piccie?
- Yeah, might as well

224
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,720
Watch it, watch it.

225
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:50,280
- You got the shiny thing.
- No, Chris. Leave that.

226
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,120
Let the loadies do that, the lazy bastards.

227
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,120
I'm going for a piss.

228
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:00,880
For my parents, for Jilly, for Kate
when she's 15, and one for you.

229
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,520
Tossers!

230
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,320
What does mine say?

231
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:07,120
"Cock this up and I'll come back to haunt you."

232
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:11,000
- Seriously. If it goes wrong...
- Yeah?

233
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:13,160
Can I have your sailboard?

234
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:15,840
- Yeah, if you do one thing for me.
- Aye.

235
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:18,280
- Pay off the mortgage on my house.
- Right-oh.

236
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,240
- Andy.
- Oi, clever bollocks.

237
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:23,880
- Introduce yourself.
- Name and proof-of-life statement.

238
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,880
We need to know you're alive
if we have to give a ransom away.

239
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,720
Andy McNab, 31. If I win, I'd like
to travel and work with children.

240
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,400
Thank you. Stan.

241
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:39,680
- Stan Rigby.
- Otherwise known as "Doctor Sex".

242
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,320
Statement: "Chaucer died
on October 25th, 1400."

243
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:50,440
Tony Benati. Swiss-Italian. Ex-Royal Marine.

244
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:53,120
- Hobbies: Tall women.
- Statement?

245
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:58,440
Statement? "That's another fine mess
you've gotten me into!"

246
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,680
- Mark Warner, mate.
- Mate!

247
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:04,560
Kiwi. Australian SAS. Statement:

248
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:08,400
"I'm five foot six, and that's official!"

249
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,560
And I'm shy!

250
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,320
Dinger.

251
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,200
Ex-para. Chain-smoker.

252
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,320
Statement: "My God,
my Country, my Harley Davidson."

253
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:31,320
- Not necessarily in that order.
- You wanker.

254
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,880
Baz Lane. Ex-para like Dinger,
only better looking.

255
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:37,320
Statement: "I will give up smoking next year."

256
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,480
This year! Shit.

257
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:47,480
Chris. Statement: "I have
an XR4i and the colour is green."

258
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:51,600
Tony, mail I'll stick it in your kit
when you're done.

259
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,440
- You've forgotten Ray.
- Brilliant! My poll tax demand.

260
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,760
- Ray!
- "Ray Davies. From Reader's Digest:

261
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:06,480
Congratulations, you've been
selected from many in your area

262
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:10,400
for a free entry into our special prize draw."

263
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,920
That's shit, that is.

264
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:16,760
- Is that your statement?
- Yes.

265
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,520
- You all set?
- Yeah.

266
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:27,040
Since yesterday,
more Roland missiles are en route,

267
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,880
so we'll be going down a bit lower,
to about 80 feet, to avoid them.

268
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:34,440
OK. Let's go through
those contact drills again, Harry.

269
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:40,080
All right, then. Contact on landing.
We'll break and drop you 40Ks west.

270
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:43,280
Contact on departure. Get me on
the TACBE and I'll come back,

271
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,600
and give you one minute.

272
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,000
I want plenty of covering fire
on the approach, OK?

273
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,480
OK.

274
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,320
If we go down, whatever way
you go, we'll go the other.

275
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:58,480
Nothing personal, but to the Iraqis
we're simply aircrew,

276
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,360
whereas you guys are Friday the 13th.

277
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:05,920
- Harold, we've got our slot.
- All right, let's get to work.

278
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,360
- Go well?
- Well?

279
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,400
They've stolen half of D Squadron's kit,

280
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,080
and there's a complaint from the Americans,

281
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,400
but for a three day turnaround, it's not bad.

282
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:40,040
120, 80 feet, 90 knots.

283
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,480
Roger that, 80 feet, 90 knots.

284
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:49,040
- Re-entrant left, four miles.
- Roger that. Re-entrant left.

285
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,000
Building left. Lights have just come on.

286
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,280
Roger that. Lights on.

287
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:57,480
Tell your crew we're now over the border.

288
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,360
OK.

289
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,960
- We're over the border.
- We're over the border!

290
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:07,720
- Clear lines.
- We're over the border.

291
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,040
- Body armour?
- Sit on it, mate.

292
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:13,360
- Protect your bollocks.
- You ain't got any, mate.

293
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,720
{y: I}I went over every detail of the job.

294
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,360
{y: I}I was worried by
{y: I}the lack of intelligence and kit.

295
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,160
"No recent satellite pics", "no decent maps."

296
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,160
{y: I}But these things happen.
{y: I}You get on with what you've got.

297
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,960
{y: I}At least we were well armed.
{y: I}I was conscious too

298
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,480
{y: I}about the high proportionof green sweets.

299
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:35,640
{y: I}I needed to swap them for red ones
{y: I}at the first opportunity.

300
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,480
Lock on!

301
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:43,640
- Lock on!
- Shit!

302
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,800
- Breaking left.
- Break left.

303
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,680
Fine.

304
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,280
Chaffing.

305
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,040
"7"0, 60 feet.

306
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,320
- 50 feet.
- 50 feet. Roger.

307
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,320
Bollocks to it. If this is going to
happen, I don't want to hear it.

308
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:11,080
- Deploy.
- Should be there.

309
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,480
Was that a Roland?

310
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:30,640
It's all right for you.
We have to come back this way.

311
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,640
Two minutes to landing.

312
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:40,040
Two minutes!
Two minutes!

313
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,680
Ready!

314
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,280
12 feet, 10 feet!

315
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,080
Eight feet!

316
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:57,160
Six feet!

317
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,040
Four feet!

318
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,960
That's it. Go, go, go!

319
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,440
Four gone, five gone, six gone.

320
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:12,800
Approximately 15 seconds.

321
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,640
Seven gone.

322
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,640
Andy's doing the final sweep.

323
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:30,760
Eight gone. All clear. Let's go, go, go!

324
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,960
What the hell is that doing here?

325
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,520
Where are the dogs?

326
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:11,040
There's a plantation over there, about half a K.

327
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,240
- It wasn't on the map.
- No.

328
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:19,760
What the f...?

329
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,800
Scud.

330
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,600
Get a fix on those positions. Chris!

331
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,920
Get the rest of them in.

332
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,680
"It was over a two"- "hour hike"
"to the MSR", "the main supply route."

333
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,920
{y: I}The danger of finding
"a hide"- "out in pitch black"

334
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,960
{y: I}is that at first light you could find
{y: I}yourself in a housing estate.

335
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:38,480
"The MSR wasn't a road like the M1",
{y: I}but a white strip of sunbaked sand.

336
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,640
{y: I}I saw the junction boxes straight away.

337
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,080
{y: I}That gave us the landline.

338
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,240
{y: I}But we had a problem.

339
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:08,720
Give us a hand, mate.
It's going to be a squirty one.

340
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:18,960
There's a battery of S60s right on our doorstep.

341
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:21,320
- We'll have to move.
- Now?

342
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:27,680
No, we'll wait till dark.
Good news is I've located a landline.

343
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,960
- Any joy, Baz?
- No.

344
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,680
No problem. Lost comms plan
comes into effect as of noon.

345
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:41,880
The heli will meet us tonight with a new one.

346
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,120
Do we have to hump
all this stuff back to the Rv?

347
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,440
No, we'll go. Ray and his lot can stay here.

348
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,440
Did you say you've seen a landline?

349
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,440
Yeah. Stan, you can take the next stag.

350
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,640
This is Bravo Two Zero.

351
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:11,520
We are a ground call sign, over.

352
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:16,600
From now on, we each carry our own shit.

353
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,880
Sounds like a thought for today.

354
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:22,680
This is Bravo Two Zero.
We are a ground call sign, over.

355
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:27,160
Why don't we cut it as soon
as it gets dark and then piss off?

356
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:32,160
Without a radio we're in the shit.
This is going to take a few days.

357
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,280
Let's Rv with the heli,
get a new one. Then we'll crack on.

358
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:55,760
This is Bravo Two Zero.
We are a ground call sign, over.

359
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:45,600
This is Bravo Two Zero.
We are a ground call sign, over.

360
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,240
No luck?

361
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:52,800
I'm sending OK, but I don't know
if they're getting it.

362
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,320
We might have a bum frequency.

363
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:57,160
Meaning what?

364
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,280
Well if they give us a new radio tonight,

365
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:03,480
it still wouldn't work.

366
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,200
It's noon.

367
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,120
Lost comms plan
comes into effect now at the base.

368
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:16,200
So do we go for the Rv tonight or what?

369
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,800
We go for the Rv.

370
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,160
Mm.

371
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,080
Hello, governor.

372
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:49,680
{y: I}It had to be Ray. If it had been
"anyone else", "Tony or Stan",

373
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,720
{y: I}they might have talked the kid down.

374
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:55,840
"His own kids might love him", "but he'd"
{y: I}never get a job playing Santa Claus.

375
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:59,920
Lovely piece of choccie, yeah.
Look at that, look at that.

376
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:02,280
From the old country. Here you are, here.

377
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:04,800
Come on. Shit!

378
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:13,920
{y: I}Why didn't we shoot him.?

379
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:18,120
"0ne", "that's a definite compromise."
"Two", "if their boys get hold of us",

380
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:22,400
{y: I}we're not going to last five minutes.
"Three", "we're not into that", "anyway."

381
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:31,440
- What's going on?
- He's legging it to the MSR.

382
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:34,000
There's a truck full of jundies
bang in the middle.

383
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:37,320
Get on the guard net,
tell them we have a compromise.

384
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,880
We're going to head for the Rv.
Stan, get back on stag.

385
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,720
Hello, Zero. This is Bravo Two Zero.
Radio check, over.

386
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,280
Hello, Zero. Hello, Zero. This is Bravo Two Zero.

387
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,560
Radio check, over.

388
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,880
Hey, Dinger?

389
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:57,640
- Is there an apostrophe in "we're"?
- As in what?

390
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:01,240
- As in "we're in the shit".
- Oh, yes.

391
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,920
Hello, Zero. Hello, Zero. This is Bravo Two Zero.

392
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,000
Radio check, over.

393
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,800
Listen in! We're going to follow
the dead ground south to the Rv.

394
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,520
If we make good distance now,
we can make the rest in darkness.

395
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,640
Leave all your shit here. Just take your bergens.

396
00:33:32,840 --> 00:33:35,240
- Is a brew out of the question?
- Signals kit?

397
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,280
Top of my bergen. Code's in my map pocket.

398
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:40,400
- Medic kit?
- Top of my bergen.

399
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:43,400
- OK. Who's got the shiny thing?
- I've got it.

400
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:45,560
Bollocks, what's that?

401
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,160
- Armour.
- Stand to! Come on! Stand to!

402
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,560
- Coming in.
- Man coming in!

403
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,280
It's a bulldozer. I think he's lost.

404
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:02,400
Lost? A sodding bulldozer lost?

405
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,840
- Which way is he heading?
- Over there, mate.

406
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:09,760
OK, we wait it out till he's gone.

407
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,240
Fucking hell!

408
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,160
Let's get on with it.

409
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,880
- Go west, young man, go west.
- Let's make like rag-heads.

410
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,520
- Well?
- The soldiers just told him to piss off.

411
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,600
He's heading for the guns.

412
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,520
We should have a unión,
these hours are scandalous

413
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:18,480
Yeah. The food's shit, too.

414
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,800
{y: I}We had to make the RV with the heli.

415
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,920
"At least if we had a contact on the planes",

416
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,240
{y: I}we wouldn't be sitting targets.

417
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,160
- Stand to! Stand to!
- Stand to!

418
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,880
{y: I}0f course you're afraid.
{y: I}Anyone who says they're not

419
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,480
{y: I}is either lying or needs to see a shrink.

420
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,760
{y: I}You want to make a big hole to hide in.

421
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,600
{y: I}You'd get your spoon out
{y: I}and dig if it would help.

422
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,000
{y: I}Then training takes over.
"You psyche yourself up",

423
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,320
"check all your pouches are closed",
"your pockets done",

424
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,520
{y: I}and your magazines are on tight.

425
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,400
Come on, come on.

426
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:17,000
What's happening?
What's happening behind me, Tony?

427
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,600
Talk to me, mate!

428
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:22,040
I can't see jack shit,
but I can hear them to your half right!

429
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,560
- We've got to go!
- Ready!

430
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,200
- Ready!
- Ready!

431
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:29,880
Ready! Ray, you ready?

432
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,560
Shit!

433
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,640
We're going to go for it. Stand your ground!

434
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,000
- Stand your ground!
- Stand your ground!

435
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,800
- Chris, stand by!
- Aye!

436
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,960
"You move forward", "take the fight to them."

437
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,000
{y: I}It's the last thing they're expecting.

438
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,760
"You're dead anyway",
{y: I}so anything you do is a bonus.

439
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,160
Coming through!

440
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:08,080
- Coming through!
- Coming through!

441
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,880
Coming through!

442
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:15,440
Stoppage! Bastards!

443
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,960
- Coming through!
- Coming through!

444
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:40,440
- Gunner!
- Coming through!

445
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,360
Coming through!

446
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,480
Shit!

447
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:53,800
Here, here, lay it here.

448
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:05,160
Coming through!
Coming through! Coming through!

449
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:07,320
Down!

450
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,880
Left!

451
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,600
Aargh!

452
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:58,640
Oh, God!

453
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,400
Fucking outrageous!

454
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,320
Now what?

455
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,160
Right! We're going to pick up our bergens.

456
00:42:20,360 --> 00:42:25,000
We're going to head west.
We've got an hour till last light.

457
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:28,440
We wait till it gets dark and sort our shit out.

458
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:30,760
- Pass it on.
- Back to the bergens.

459
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,240
- Across the MSR?
- Across the MSR.

460
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,240
Once it gets dark, we double back.

461
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,880
Back to the bergens!

462
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,640
"For the next hour",
{y: I}we fought with the jundies

463
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,560
{y: I}as they pursued us across the plain.

464
00:43:04,080 --> 00:43:06,080
Good here, ain't it

465
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,800
Argh!

466
00:43:11,480 --> 00:43:15,000
- Man down! Man down!
- Man down! Man down!

467
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,800
You all right, mate?
Yeah? Come on.

468
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,920
Let's go. Let's go!

469
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,560
Shit!

470
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:38,480
- Present off the wife.
- Where's the bloody medic kit?

471
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,760
{y: I}The bergens were binned.

472
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,040
{y: I}We couldn't move
{y: I}quickly enough with them.

473
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:52,200
{y: I}0ur belt kits carried what we
"couldn't do without" - "water and ammo."

474
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:54,720
{y: I}We could hear contacts in the distance.

475
00:43:54,920 --> 00:43:58,040
"Whoever they were firing at", "it wasn't us."

476
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,600
On me! On me!

477
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,240
To your right, to your right! On me!

478
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:54,080
Five, six.

479
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:58,600
Seven.

480
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:05,680
- Did anybody see Stan go down?
- No, mate.

481
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:11,280
OK. Three minutes, then we go back for him.

482
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:17,160
Go right! Go right!

483
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:22,040
- You OK?
- Christ!

484
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:26,080
I'm dehydrating. I'm still wearing my thermals.

485
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,160
- Mark, give us a fix, mate.
- OK, mate.

486
00:45:31,360 --> 00:45:32,800
Tony.

487
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:40,280
- Shit, it's a green one.
- Give it here. I'll have it.

488
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:45,280
You're a doctor. Aren't you going to ask me?

489
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,600
- What?
- How my herpes is getting on.

490
00:45:54,840 --> 00:45:58,040
Baz. You've got the radio, mate?

491
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:02,000
No, it was shot to shit.
We've still got the TACBE, though.

492
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:06,120
- Yes!
- Let's call in the AWACS

493
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,880
and get shot of this nonsense.

494
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:13,920
- Chris, you got the medic kit?
- No, but I saved my flask.

495
00:46:14,120 --> 00:46:18,560
Oh, great One of us takes a round,
we'll be glad to have a quick nib.

496
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,000
- You OK?
- My leg's buggered.

497
00:46:23,200 --> 00:46:25,920
I must've hurt it on a hill It's not broken.

498
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:31,000
- You want me to have a look at it?
- No, if I keep moving it'll be OK.

499
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,320
Take a look at it, Stan.

500
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:38,200
Shit.

501
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:41,640
- No.
- Shit.

502
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:44,440
- Baz, get on the TACBE.
- Yeah.

503
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:46,920
Yeah, let's get in some air support.

504
00:46:49,320 --> 00:46:52,240
Hello, AWACS. This is Bravo Two Zero.

505
00:46:52,440 --> 00:46:54,640
We are a ground call sign, over.

506
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:56,920
- No link.
- Yeah.

507
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:01,720
Hello, AWACS. This is Bravo Two Zero.

508
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,440
We are a ground call sign, over.

509
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:10,080
Christ, is it my imagination or is it getting cold?

510
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:14,040
Hello, AWACS. This is Bravo Two Zero.

511
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:17,760
We are a ground call sign.
I have a fix for you, over.

512
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,040
Oh, shit!

513
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:32,640
Hello, any call sign. This is Bravo Two Zero.

514
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:36,680
We are a ground call sign
and need assistance, over.

515
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:43,840
OK. Options.

516
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,320
We either go for the heli Rv
or we head for Syria.

517
00:47:50,120 --> 00:47:55,520
- How far is the border?
- At line of sight, about 170Ks.

518
00:47:56,680 --> 00:48:00,360
- It's a hell of a long tab.
- Don't worry about it, mate.

519
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:03,360
On the other hand, between us and the heli

520
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,720
there's a lot of pissed-off people.

521
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:09,560
Even if we make the heli Rv,
doesn't mean Harry will

522
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:13,000
If there's one set of guns,
there'll be more. Many more.

523
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,840
- So it's the border.
- Yeah.

524
00:48:16,040 --> 00:48:19,880
- Yeah.
- Are you up to it?

525
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:24,600
OK. Chris, you go lead scout.

526
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:29,040
Then Stan and Ray.
I'll back them. Then the rest of you.

527
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,080
OK, let's go!

528
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,680
- Here, stick that on your head.
- Cheers.

529
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,080
{y: I}We'd left the contact well behind
{y: I}and were looking good.

530
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,640
{y: I}Then the weather changed.
{y: I}"Spring day in the UK'; my arse.

531
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:04,800
{y: I}It was the worst this region
{y: I}had experienced in 30 years.

532
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:20,280
Aircraft. We're going to stop and try the TACBE.

533
00:49:25,800 --> 00:49:30,000
We're going to try the TACBE.
We're going to try the TACBE.

534
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:37,600
Get me a fix, Mark.

535
00:49:45,600 --> 00:49:49,800
Hello, any call sign. This is Bravo Two Zero.

536
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,480
We're a ground call sign,
and we're in the shit, over.

537
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:01,880
Hello, any call sign.
This is Bravo Two Zero.

538
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:06,560
We're a ground call sign
and we're in the shit, over.

539
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,920
Say again, Bravo Two Zero.
You're weak.

540
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:14,280
Turn back north, turn back north, over.

541
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:24,480
Hello, any call sign.
This is Bravo Two Zero, over.

542
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,560
No joy.

543
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:41,640
- Where's Ray?
- And Stan and Chris?

544
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:46,040
Where are they?

545
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:51,720
I told them to stop.

546
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,160
{y: I}We tabbed all night
{y: I}but never found Ray or the others.

547
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:02,840
{y: I}I knew he was in a shit state.

548
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,600
{y: I}I should have checked
{y: I}that he passed the message on.

549
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:08,280
{y: I}I should have checked.

550
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:20,480
{y: I}That night we did 85K.
{y: I}That's two marathons.

551
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,720
{y: I}The only cover we could find
{y: I}stood out like a dog's bollocks.

552
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:26,920
{y: I}This meant we'd leave sign
"the moment we moved off",

553
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:31,880
{y: I}but this was the least of our worries.
{y: I}Mark was down with hypothermia.

554
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:35,320
"Yeah", "hypothermia in the desert."

555
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:41,680
Listen, mate. You're not as cold
as your body wants you to think.

556
00:51:41,880 --> 00:51:44,760
- I'm not?
- No.

557
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,640
And what's more...

558
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,320
...you're showing none
of the symptoms of hypothermia.

559
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,320
That's good, mate.

560
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:04,760
Tell me, am I hallucinating or is this snow?

561
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:13,040
Bollocks to it. I'm going to make a brew.

562
00:52:13,240 --> 00:52:15,800
Not only are we freezing to death,

563
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:19,680
you've now decided to put a sign out
saying: "Here we are, come get us."

564
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,160
What is it? Coffee or hot chocolate?

565
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,120
OK, mate. Drink up.

566
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,800
You made it through last night. You
ain't going to fall down on me now.

567
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,280
Are you still thinking about Ray and his crew?

568
00:53:24,480 --> 00:53:26,520
- Yeah.
- Well don't.

569
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:29,760
They're big and ugly enough
to sort themselves out.

570
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,400
Oh, shit!

571
00:53:38,280 --> 00:53:42,040
Another bleeding shepherd! And he's pinged us.

572
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:45,320
Looks like he's desperate for company.

573
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:48,040
- I don't believe it!
- Where do they all come from?

574
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:51,120
- Tony, you better go talk to him.
- My Arabic is shit.

575
00:53:51,320 --> 00:53:54,720
Well you've got three minutes
to become really fluent.

576
00:54:11,080 --> 00:54:13,240
- English?
- Yeah. Tony.

577
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,240
Mohammed.

578
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:16,880
What's he saying, mate?

579
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,920
Where is the market?

580
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,480
He's asking the way to Sainsbury's?

581
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:39,760
Oh, fucking outrageous!

582
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:47,200
{y: I}Still 70Ks to the border and we
"needed to make it by first light",

583
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:51,480
"because if the Iraqis didn't kill us",
{y: I}the weather was going to.

584
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,920
Make sure it's got a heater and a radio.

585
00:54:55,120 --> 00:54:58,720
- Anything else?
- Yeah. Power steering,

586
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:04,680
electric windows, ABS, CD player, mobile phone.

587
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,400
Shut up, will you?

588
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:19,520
I don't believe this!

589
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:24,200
- Get out!
- Please!

590
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,320
We've been looking at the things all day.

591
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,040
- Get out!
- Don't shoot! Please!

592
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:32,920
Please!

593
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:36,800
Please! No shoot, no kill!

594
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,480
Please!

595
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:47,520
- Shut up!
- Move!

596
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:53,360
Please don't hurt my father.
We're Christian. You see?

597
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:55,000
See?

598
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:56,720
Him Muslim!

599
00:56:00,680 --> 00:56:02,040
Fuck off, mate!

600
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,320
Cigarettes! Here, I give you cigarettes!

601
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:08,560
Here!

602
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,280
What's his fucking problem?

603
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,440
You are stealing his taxi. It's his living.

604
00:56:22,560 --> 00:56:25,000
Move!

605
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:28,960
Down, down, down!

606
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:44,720
It's going to be a tight fit, ain't it?

607
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:47,000
- What did you do with them?
- They'll live.

608
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:49,800
Pissed-off, but they'll live.

609
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,440
Anybody know how to put these in forward?

610
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,680
No, down.

611
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,360
No, up.

612
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:09,760
Baz, give me some directions
when we come to the junctions.

613
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:12,520
- Point me west.
- How many Ks to the border?

614
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:16,440
- About 35, mate.
- We'll drive as far as we can.

615
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:18,560
We'll dump it and cross on foot.

616
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:21,360
You see?
Why didn't you lift something like that?

617
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:25,640
Mark, shut up. You were dying
of hypothermia an hour ago.

618
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:30,080
Bollocks, mate!

619
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:42,560
# "My husband has breath like a dog"

620
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:49,720
# "His penis is small"
{y: I}and covered with blackheads

621
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,680
# "Nowadays I sleep with the goats"

622
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:59,920
# "They have much bigger penises"

623
00:58:00,120 --> 00:58:03,680
#"And are twice as intelligent..."

624
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,200
Anybody get that sign?

625
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:33,560
"Baghdad welcomes careful drivers."

626
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,560
But...

627
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,760
Did you know that
Saddam Hussein is an anagram

628
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,640
of "He's a sad nudist"?

629
00:58:48,760 --> 00:58:51,400
- Where did the "m" go?
- I swapped it for a "t".

630
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:54,880
- You can't do that.
- Well I just did.

631
00:58:55,360 --> 00:58:56,640
That's not right.

632
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,280
What's the score?

633
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:37,800
Looks like some sort of checkpoint.

634
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:49,600
- How far to the border, Mark?
- Still waiting, mate.

635
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:53,600
Do we stay or do we go?

636
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:09,640
We're going to go for that ridge on the left. OK?

637
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:14,320
It's about 11K, mate. 11K to the border.

638
01:00:18,880 --> 01:00:21,600
- As soon as he pings us.
- We'll take the other two.

639
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:41,320
Stand by.

640
01:00:44,120 --> 01:00:45,800
Stand by.

641
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:47,920
Go, go, go!

642
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:54,360
Go! Come on!

643
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:10,960
OK, Mark!

644
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:12,880
Coming through!

645
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,440
On me, on me, on me!

646
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:50,200
One, two, three. Come on, come on!

647
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,280
Four! Go!

648
01:02:08,320 --> 01:02:11,840
- Is that the border?
- That's it, mate.

649
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:20,360
Let's do it.

650
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:43,800
Sentries.

651
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:56,520
Heavy machine guns. Trucks.

652
01:03:56,720 --> 01:04:00,400
Military vehicles.
The whole fucking army's there.

653
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:09,400
Shit!

654
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:37,240
Go, go, go!

655
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,240
Shit!

656
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,360
Come on, Ding, we can make it.

657
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,960
Bollocks to this!

658
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:57,080
I'm freezing!

659
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:02,680
The last one.

660
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,280
Ain't got none left, have you, mate?

661
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,320
Ta.

662
01:06:25,280 --> 01:06:27,040
Ready?

663
01:06:28,120 --> 01:06:29,400
Let's go.

664
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:31,240
{y: I}It took Mark and me most of the night

665
01:06:31,440 --> 01:06:33,840
{y: I}to work our way
{y: I}through the Iraqi positions.

666
01:06:34,040 --> 01:06:36,760
{y: I}In all the confusión
"we lost Tony", "Baz and Dinger."

667
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:40,320
{y: I}There was no time to think about that.
{y: I}We were low on ammo.

668
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,160
{y: I}Soon the only weapon left
"would be the darkness",

669
01:06:43,360 --> 01:06:45,040
{y: I}and that was fading fast.

670
01:07:39,560 --> 01:07:41,320
Let's go!

671
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:00,560
Mark!

672
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,320
Mark!

673
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:11,240
Mark...

674
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,400
{y: I}0nly 2Ks to go.

675
01:09:38,640 --> 01:09:43,240
"Four hours till last light",
{y: I}and I could try again.

676
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:03,320
- Tel Aviv!
- Tel Aviv!

677
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,400
- Your name?
- McNab.

678
01:11:22,600 --> 01:11:24,720
- Rank?
- Sergeant.

679
01:11:25,360 --> 01:11:28,000
Your unit?

680
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:35,680
Your unit?

681
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:41,240
I cannot answer that question.

682
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:46,040
- You are an Israeli?
- No, I'm British.

683
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,600
- I'm just a British soldier.
- You are an Israeli!

684
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,440
Do you take me for a foo"I?"

685
01:11:52,680 --> 01:11:55,720
Can you tell me what you are doing here?

686
01:12:06,960 --> 01:12:09,360
I'm a British soldier.

687
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,400
Just a British soldier.

688
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:19,600
You are an Israeli!

689
01:12:19,800 --> 01:12:21,440
Pig!

690
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:49,520
Once again, what is your name?

691
01:12:51,040 --> 01:12:53,640
McNab.

692
01:12:53,880 --> 01:12:56,800
- Your rank?
- Sergeant.

693
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,120
And your unit?

694
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:07,680
Under the Geneva Convention,
I'm afraid I can't answer that question.

695
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,800
Fool!

696
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,920
We are not in Geneva.

697
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,800
- What is that?
- It's gold.

698
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:09,520
Take it off. Show me.

699
01:14:11,680 --> 01:14:15,480
- You like my English?
- Yeah, it's very good.

700
01:14:15,680 --> 01:14:19,000
Of course it is. Do you think I'm stupid?

701
01:14:20,240 --> 01:14:22,600
You think we're all stupid.

702
01:14:28,920 --> 01:14:30,920
Please.

703
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,880
I want you to tell me what Israel is doing here.

704
01:14:37,080 --> 01:14:40,000
- Now.
- I'm sorry. I can't answer that...

705
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,680
Fucking outrageous.

706
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,480
These coins are what?

707
01:15:24,960 --> 01:15:28,800
Gold. Gold sovereigns.

708
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:32,120
Why do you carry such wealth?

709
01:15:32,320 --> 01:15:36,040
In case we need food. It's bad to steal

710
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,000
Quite so.

711
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,520
"His boots were handmade",
{y: I}probably in London.

712
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,640
{y: I}This boy had to be a rupert.

713
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:06,480
- Your name is?
- McNab.

714
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:08,920
- Rank?
- Sergeant.

715
01:16:09,120 --> 01:16:13,040
- What do your friends call you?
- Andy.

716
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,360
Andy.

717
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:17,640
Perhaps you can help me.

718
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:21,360
Of course, we have captured
the other members of your group.

719
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:23,520
What I need to know now, Andy...

720
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:28,800
Are you the same group that was
discovered three days ago?

721
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:35,560
- I'm trying to help you, Andy.
- I don't understand.

722
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:40,040
I'm trying to help, but you're confusing me.

723
01:16:40,880 --> 01:16:43,880
I don't know jack shit.

724
01:16:44,840 --> 01:16:47,000
Have you eaten recently?

725
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:49,240
No.

726
01:16:50,200 --> 01:16:55,240
So, Andy. What was your unit doing
in this part of the worid?

727
01:16:56,720 --> 01:17:00,760
Israeli, British... doesn't matter much to me.

728
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:02,480
For now.

729
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:07,240
However, both countries would not
send men who know jack shit

730
01:17:07,440 --> 01:17:10,680
into their enemy's territory.

731
01:17:10,880 --> 01:17:14,120
You are special forces, Andy.

732
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,800
I understand that you are still doing your duty,

733
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:22,720
and you must understand
that I have to do mine.

734
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:27,160
So, what was your task, Andy?

735
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:30,640
Please, don't insult me.

736
01:17:32,000 --> 01:17:34,800
I don't even... I don't even know where I am.

737
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,680
The officers just order us about,
they don't tell us anything.

738
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:43,520
I hate the army. They didn't tell me
I would have to do things like this.

739
01:17:43,720 --> 01:17:47,040
I mean, I don't even know why we're at war.

740
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,760
Do you know who the White Socks are, Andy?

741
01:17:55,960 --> 01:17:57,960
No.

742
01:18:01,120 --> 01:18:04,560
They are our secret police,

743
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:09,080
and their methods
are far more brutal than ours.

744
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,840
So, I will ask you again:

745
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:17,160
What is your unit, and what
were you doing in northern Iraq?

746
01:18:18,040 --> 01:18:22,600
If you answer me truthfully, I will see
what I can do to protect you.

747
01:18:26,640 --> 01:18:29,120
There is nothing more I can do to help you.

748
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:39,560
Whoever your God is, you'll need him now.

749
01:19:09,640 --> 01:19:12,760
- This is fucking outrageous!
- Dinger?

750
01:19:12,960 --> 01:19:14,840
Andy!

751
01:19:34,760 --> 01:19:36,240
Bastard!

752
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:05,360
- Who's farted?
- Dinger, shut the fuck up.

753
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:09,680
- You like?
- Mmm. My favourite. What is it?

754
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:13,840
I make another just for you.

755
01:20:14,600 --> 01:20:17,520
We're amongst barbarians.

756
01:20:39,760 --> 01:20:41,720
Did you see what happened to Tony?

757
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:47,440
No. What about Baz?

758
01:20:49,760 --> 01:20:51,040
Dead.

759
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:56,480
Hypothermia. We had to cross the river.

760
01:20:56,680 --> 01:20:59,640
Oh, Andy. He was in a shit state, mate.

761
01:20:59,840 --> 01:21:03,680
I compromised myself to the locals
hoping they'd help,

762
01:21:03,880 --> 01:21:05,920
but it was too late.

763
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:10,560
- What about Mark?
- He's dead, mate.

764
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,440
He took some rounds really close up.

765
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:25,280
- How far did you get?
- I was there. I could almost taste it.

766
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:29,960
- No talk, or bang, bang!
- Yeah, yeah. OK, mate.

767
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:53,120
- Argh!
- Up, up, up!

768
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:29,160
- You all right?
- Scared shitless.

769
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:35,840
Well at least they can't make us pregnant.

770
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:14,640
Hello?

771
01:23:17,400 --> 01:23:19,400
Are you sitting comfortably?

772
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:23,640
Andy, isn't it?

773
01:23:25,000 --> 01:23:27,360
Yes.

774
01:23:27,560 --> 01:23:30,120
How are you feeling?

775
01:23:30,960 --> 01:23:35,480
I think I need medical attention,
and my friend also.

776
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:39,600
Of course. We are not animals.

777
01:23:41,840 --> 01:23:47,080
But first you will tell us
what you are doing in our country.

778
01:23:48,320 --> 01:23:50,360
I'm trying to help you, but I don't...

779
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:59,040
You are not helping us at all Andy.

780
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:01,760
Tell me the plans of the Israelis, Andy.

781
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:05,160
I have told you, I'm not an Israeli.

782
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,560
Oh, shit!

783
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:30,320
{y: I}There's nothing you can do about pain.

784
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,680
{y: I}You've just got to accept it.

785
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:35,360
{y: I}But it's great when your body says:
{y: I}"That's enough';

786
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:38,920
{y: I}and starts to drift you off
{y: I}into unconsciousness.

787
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:50,000
- Ding?
- Andy!

788
01:24:56,720 --> 01:24:58,640
Help me.

789
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,880
Please help me.

790
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:30,480
I can prove I'm not an Israeli.

791
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:36,600
- How?
- Because I have a foreskin.

792
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:41,160
- A what, Andy?
- A foreskin.

793
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:45,200
Jews are circumcised, it's part of their religion.

794
01:25:50,800 --> 01:25:52,880
Let me show you.

795
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:11,720
See! Foreskin.

796
01:26:11,920 --> 01:26:16,560
"I pulled as hard as I could",
{y: I}which was difficult due to the cold.

797
01:26:26,680 --> 01:26:31,120
So, Andy. Now you will tell me, huh?

798
01:26:31,320 --> 01:26:36,240
What is your missión and what else
are the British planning to do?

799
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:45,760
"We might be captured",
{y: I}but we still had a job to do.

800
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:48,760
{y: I}The Regiment needed time
{y: I}to carry out damage limitation.

801
01:26:48,960 --> 01:26:50,480
{y: I}They had to assume the worst.

802
01:26:50,680 --> 01:26:53,040
{y: I}That we'd been captured
{y: I}and told the Iraqis everything.

803
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:56,360
{y: I}0ther operations would
{y: I}have to be cancelled or changed.

804
01:26:56,560 --> 01:26:59,200
"Queen and Country" - "that's bullshit."

805
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:06,120
- Shall we start again, Andy?
- No!

806
01:27:37,920 --> 01:27:41,160
So, Andy. Tell us.

807
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:53,280
I'm a member of a search and rescue team.

808
01:27:53,480 --> 01:27:55,880
And what do you do, Andy?

809
01:27:57,760 --> 01:28:00,680
We rescue downed pilots.

810
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:03,440
- I'm a medic.
- Medic?

811
01:28:05,920 --> 01:28:07,680
And what was your missión on this occasión?

812
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:10,960
I don't know. The officer knew.

813
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:15,840
They operate on a "need to know" basis.

814
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,160
They don't tell us anything,
just to get on the heli.

815
01:28:23,360 --> 01:28:25,520
- The helicopter.
- Good, Andy.

816
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,960
Now you'll eat. Then we will talk some more.

817
01:28:30,200 --> 01:28:33,760
Thank you. And my friend?

818
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,600
Yes, yes.

819
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:40,440
But first you will sign a paper
for the Red Cross.

820
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:43,520
So they know you are all right.

821
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:53,960
I can't. The army will punish me
if you ever send me home.

822
01:29:14,320 --> 01:29:17,440
{y: I}I tried to find God.
{y: I}I begged Him to help us

823
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:20,920
{y: I}and said as much of the Lord's Prayer
{y: I}as I could remember.

824
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:23,720
{y: I}Nothing happened.

825
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:33,080
Manchester United win. Very good team.

826
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:36,200
You look very happy now. You look very happy.

827
01:29:45,960 --> 01:29:47,720
- Stan?
- Hey, no look!

828
01:29:54,360 --> 01:29:56,640
- Come here often, wanker?
- Hey, guys, no talking!

829
01:29:56,840 --> 01:29:58,360
No talking, Dinger!

830
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,480
- Stan's here.
- Shut up, shut up!

831
01:30:07,360 --> 01:30:10,120
You're in a terrible state, Andy.

832
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:16,880
How are your teeth? Are they
still giving you some problems?

833
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:21,040
They're broken.

834
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:29,800
We have a dentist here.
He worked in Guy's for nine years.

835
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,360
One of the best.

836
01:30:38,920 --> 01:30:41,400
Open wide, please.

837
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,440
Do you really think we are going to help you?

838
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:04,280
You are irrelevant to us. You lied to us.

839
01:31:04,480 --> 01:31:07,400
You are the men from the South, aren't you?

840
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,960
You're stupid. Stupid.

841
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:14,040
I'm helping you all I can, but I'm just a medic.

842
01:31:14,240 --> 01:31:17,480
How many medics, Andy, leave 100 men dead,

843
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:19,960
and another 100 in the hospita"I?"

844
01:31:20,160 --> 01:31:23,480
Tell me what your task was. Tell me. Tell me!

845
01:31:23,680 --> 01:31:26,080
I told you I don't know anything about that.

846
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:29,880
I'm a medic. Please. Please!

847
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:35,000
I need him on his back.

848
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:56,800
Do it! Bomb me, you bastards! I'm down here!

849
01:31:57,000 --> 01:31:59,200
Don't do it! He don't mean it!

850
01:31:59,400 --> 01:32:02,440
Fuck it! Do it! Do it!

851
01:32:04,840 --> 01:32:07,600
Why are you getting me into trouble?

852
01:32:19,320 --> 01:32:22,640
I asked you for an answer yesterday.
Do you have it for me?

853
01:32:24,640 --> 01:32:26,600
Yes, sir.

854
01:32:27,440 --> 01:32:32,440
Tosca. "Turncoats for the opera."

855
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,520
Five letters.

856
01:32:35,720 --> 01:32:40,320
T- O-S...

857
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:45,480
...C- A. Tosca.

858
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:54,960
You and your friends will not last much longer.

859
01:32:56,920 --> 01:33:01,760
We have others in the hospital
You know that, Andy?

860
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:07,360
Look, you are the senior rank here, huh?

861
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:11,200
No one knows you are alive.

862
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:15,320
We can let you die, and no one would know.

863
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:18,720
Your government, they do not care about you.

864
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:21,680
To them, you are just a tool to be used.

865
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:30,240
Andy, if you will not tell me
who you are and what you are doing,

866
01:33:30,440 --> 01:33:33,240
we will simply let the others die.

867
01:33:34,120 --> 01:33:35,840
Think about it, Andy.

868
01:33:36,680 --> 01:33:38,440
You bad boy, Dinger! Bad boy!

869
01:33:38,640 --> 01:33:40,000
{y: I}This wasn't a film

870
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:43,040
{y: I}where the actor sticks out
{y: I}his chest and shouts: "Never.!"

871
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:48,760
{y: I}This was real We'd all fulfilled
{y: I}our obligations to operational security.

872
01:33:48,960 --> 01:33:51,880
{y: I}It was now time
{y: I}to fulfil our obligations to each other.

873
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:53,360
Very bad boy!

874
01:34:15,680 --> 01:34:17,720
This is disgusting.

875
01:34:21,320 --> 01:34:22,760
Why did you do that?

876
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:25,160
The window was open, so I threw it out.

877
01:34:25,360 --> 01:34:27,480
I opened the window
because those fags are killing me.

878
01:34:27,680 --> 01:34:29,720
Sorry. I see shit and have to react.

879
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:32,560
- What's this? Jam?!
- Don't even think about it.

880
01:34:32,760 --> 01:34:34,080
Don't...

881
01:34:34,280 --> 01:34:38,040
- Jam again!
- I'm closing the window.

882
01:34:38,240 --> 01:34:43,080
Clash, Sex Pistols, Showaddywaddy?

883
01:34:43,680 --> 01:34:45,200
That's not mine.

884
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,400
Sorry, your whole tape co"lle"ction
is contaminated.

885
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,760
Unbelievable.

886
01:35:08,840 --> 01:35:10,640
COP.

887
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:22,160
- A what?
- Close Observation Platoon.

888
01:35:22,360 --> 01:35:25,040
Every infantry unit has one.

889
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:29,520
We closely observe what's going on.

890
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:33,000
In this case it was the MSR.

891
01:35:33,200 --> 01:35:37,240
- MS...?
...R. The Main Supply Route.

892
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:42,120
We had to report on movements there.

893
01:35:42,320 --> 01:35:45,600
It was just a patrol put together for the job.

894
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:50,000
Tell me what happened.

895
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:54,960
A shepherd walked into our position,
so we had to get out.

896
01:36:00,480 --> 01:36:04,320
- So you headed north?
- Yeah, for Syria.

897
01:36:04,520 --> 01:36:06,720
It was the only way out.

898
01:36:06,920 --> 01:36:10,360
- How did you get in?
- A helicopter.

899
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:14,680
Show me.

900
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,080
"What I told them was a good story",
{y: I}and almost true.

901
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,120
{y: I}I simply left out words
{y: I}like "Scud"and "The Regiment".

902
01:36:29,320 --> 01:36:33,160
{y: I}I had nothing to lose. Chances were
{y: I}we were dead anyway.

903
01:36:33,360 --> 01:36:36,880
{y: I}It was now a question of
{y: I}waiting to see if they believed me.

904
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,280
Here.

905
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:44,600
"They let me be for the next few days",
{y: I}just working on Dinger and Stan.

906
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,040
{y: I}They wanted to confirm my story.

907
01:36:47,240 --> 01:36:50,360
{y: I}I would soon find out
{y: I}if it had worked out or not.

908
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:10,640
"I wasn't afraid", "I was depressed."

909
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:14,280
{y: I}I thought of Jilly and Kate not even
{y: I}knowing if I was alive or dead.

910
01:37:14,480 --> 01:37:17,800
"If they were going to do it", "let's just"
{y: I}crack on and make it quick.

911
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:23,360
Ray's bloody dead. God knows where Stan is.

912
01:37:24,520 --> 01:37:30,000
No bloody comms,
no decent maps, no bloody backup.

913
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:33,080
They can't even get the weather right.

914
01:37:34,800 --> 01:37:37,160
And all my sweets are green.

915
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:41,400
Green for Christ's sake! I hate bloody green.

916
01:39:10,200 --> 01:39:14,800
Back in Rhodesia,
there's a tree ca"lle"d morula tree...

917
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,240
{y: I}The next few days were relatively happy.

918
01:39:17,480 --> 01:39:21,040
{y: I}All we could do was talk about
"families", "life and each other."

919
01:39:21,240 --> 01:39:23,120
{y: I}Here was Dinger on God:

920
01:39:23,320 --> 01:39:25,080
I don't believe in the old bastard.

921
01:39:25,320 --> 01:39:28,320
{y: I}0n his family:

922
01:39:28,520 --> 01:39:31,920
We had the most God-awful row
the night before we left.

923
01:39:32,120 --> 01:39:33,800
Still hurts when I think about it.

924
01:39:34,000 --> 01:39:35,480
{y: I}0n me:

925
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:37,960
Henry vlll, that's who you are.

926
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:41,520
31, and already you've got
three wives. What's your excuse?

927
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:44,400
"Adoption", "mate. Never knew my mother."

928
01:39:44,600 --> 01:39:47,320
That explains everything, does it?
Your taste in music?

929
01:39:47,520 --> 01:39:50,480
Your appalling clothes?
Why did you join the army?

930
01:39:50,680 --> 01:39:51,960
{y: I}What.?

931
01:39:52,160 --> 01:39:54,000
Why did you join the army?

932
01:39:54,200 --> 01:39:55,640
{y: I}To keep out of trouble.

933
01:39:55,840 --> 01:39:57,840
You thought if you joined
there'd be no more trouble?

934
01:39:58,040 --> 01:40:01,560
{y: I}Best thing I ever did.
{y: I}Never been in trouble since.

935
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,320
What the bloody hell do you call this?

936
01:40:05,080 --> 01:40:08,840
# "He's crazy like a fool"

937
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:12,280
# "What about Daddy Cool"

938
01:40:12,480 --> 01:40:16,400
# "Daddy", "Daddy Cool"

939
01:40:16,600 --> 01:40:19,880
# "Daddy", "Daddy Cool"

940
01:40:20,080 --> 01:40:23,400
# "He's crazy like a fool"

941
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:26,960
# "What about Daddy Cool"

942
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:35,800
Hands, Andy.

943
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:51,120
Andy? Do you like Michael Jackson?

944
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:55,040
Yeah, I do.

945
01:40:55,240 --> 01:40:57,800
Did you know I sing in a group here in the city?

946
01:40:58,000 --> 01:41:01,120
Play every Saturday night.
Play the Meridien Hotel

947
01:41:01,320 --> 01:41:06,280
- No, I don't believe you.
- Why? Don't you like my voice?

948
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:11,160
# "Daddy", "Daddy Cool"

949
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:13,520
Will you show me London after the war?

950
01:41:14,240 --> 01:41:15,920
Yeah, sure.

951
01:41:16,120 --> 01:41:18,040
Andy, I love you.

952
01:41:18,760 --> 01:41:23,400
- Do you love me?
- Yes, Jeral, I love you.

953
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:38,800
Hands, Andy.

954
01:41:52,400 --> 01:41:55,160
I'm pissed off sucking up to
that little wanker for your fags.

955
01:41:55,360 --> 01:41:57,400
I will never divulge what you two get up to.

956
01:41:57,600 --> 01:42:00,280
- I licked shit off my hands for them.
- Ah, quit honking.

957
01:42:00,480 --> 01:42:03,200
I'm saving one for the firing squad.
Can't be long now.

958
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:06,440
Do you really think it's going to be
like "Breaker Morant"?

959
01:42:06,640 --> 01:42:10,000
Dawn sky, chaplain, last fag,

960
01:42:10,200 --> 01:42:13,840
instead of bend over,
bang, straight into the bin-liner?

961
01:42:16,600 --> 01:42:20,120
{y: I}We weren't shot.
"Not that week", "not the following."

962
01:42:20,320 --> 01:42:24,080
{y: I}Apart from the chance of being blown
"apart by the bombs falling on the city",

963
01:42:24,280 --> 01:42:29,080
{y: I}we slowly began to believe that
{y: I}we might just get out in one piece.

964
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:39,520
Reports in from Syria inform us
that a British soldier

965
01:42:39,720 --> 01:42:42,640
crossed the border
in the area where you were captured.

966
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:48,360
They say in Damascus that he's SAS.

967
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:54,160
Are they treating you well?

968
01:43:02,760 --> 01:43:06,040
Oh... For you.

969
01:43:14,120 --> 01:43:17,040
Well done, Chris. Well done.

970
01:43:20,160 --> 01:43:22,720
But they're all green!

971
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:18,280
Stan! Dinger!

972
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:24,480
You are going home.

973
01:44:26,400 --> 01:44:28,400
Not Andy.

974
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:31,680
Not Andy?

975
01:44:32,680 --> 01:44:35,120
Not Andy.

976
01:44:37,120 --> 01:44:40,920
- Don't worry, we'll get you out of here.
- I'll call Jilly, mate.

977
01:44:41,120 --> 01:44:43,120
Here, catch.

978
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,720
{y: I}This was the worst time for me.

979
01:44:54,920 --> 01:44:57,880
"Why had they kept me behind",
{y: I}except to shoot me.?

980
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,680
"Dying didn't worry me",

981
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:03,000
{y: I}but I'd taken it for granted that
{y: I}we were going to go together.

982
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:05,280
"I kept seeing my own funeral in Hereford",

983
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:08,080
{y: I}with Dinger smoking
{y: I}all the way through the service.

984
01:45:08,280 --> 01:45:10,600
{y: I}When a colonel had said
"what a good soldier I'd been",

985
01:45:10,800 --> 01:45:13,520
{y: I}Dinger would have shouted: "Wanker.!"

986
01:45:13,720 --> 01:45:15,880
{y: I}Then they would've drunk
{y: I}the 500 pounds of booze

987
01:45:16,080 --> 01:45:18,680
"I paid for the last piss"- "up."

988
01:45:18,880 --> 01:45:21,440
"And then I got to thinking about Kate",

989
01:45:21,640 --> 01:45:25,520
{y: I}and by first light
{y: I}she'd made me feel more composed.

990
01:45:58,040 --> 01:45:59,840
The Iraqi soldiers seemed to deserve

991
01:46:00,040 --> 01:46:04,200
pity rather than anger.
200,000 of them gave themselves up.

992
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,600
All they want to do is go home to their families.

993
01:46:06,800 --> 01:46:10,560
They are war-weary
and have no spirit left for the battle.

994
01:46:10,760 --> 01:46:13,680
The road north from Kuwait
to the Iraqi port of Basra

995
01:46:13,880 --> 01:46:15,640
showed the cruel reality.

996
01:46:15,840 --> 01:46:18,680
The highway littered with
the burnt-out, smashed remains

997
01:46:18,880 --> 01:46:20,920
of vehicles the Iraqis stole in Kuwait.

998
01:46:21,120 --> 01:46:24,360
Saddam promised them glory,
but they've lost it instead.

999
01:46:24,560 --> 01:46:27,160
As far as I'm concerned, it's over.

1000
01:46:27,360 --> 01:46:29,600
Saddam Hussein had better know it's over.

1001
01:46:29,800 --> 01:46:32,600
If Saddam makes the mistake
of starting it again,

1002
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:35,640
then he's going to have a lot more
trouble than he has in Iraq right now.

1003
01:46:37,680 --> 01:46:39,680
Reagan, Jack.

1004
01:46:41,640 --> 01:46:43,240
- Simpson.
- First name?

1005
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:46,800
- Peter.
- Through those doors, up there.

1006
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,040
McNab, British Army.

1007
01:46:49,240 --> 01:46:53,520
If we don't move quickly, they'll start
taking hostages. Come with me.

1008
01:47:00,680 --> 01:47:02,640
Mark!

1009
01:47:05,480 --> 01:47:07,520
Mark!

1010
01:47:13,040 --> 01:47:15,080
Mark.

1011
01:47:25,680 --> 01:47:28,840
I got shot, mate. In my foot!

1012
01:47:30,560 --> 01:47:35,080
Next thing, they handcuffed me
to a bed and left me to rot.

1013
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,200
Mark!

1014
01:47:39,000 --> 01:47:41,320
- Can you see it?
- What?

1015
01:47:41,520 --> 01:47:44,120
- My foot, mate.
- How can I miss it?

1016
01:47:44,320 --> 01:47:46,600
It's the size of a marrow!

1017
01:47:56,720 --> 01:48:00,040
One thing that's bugged me
ever since we landed in Saudi...

1018
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:02,080
Yeah?

1019
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:03,800
- The piece of breeze-block.
- Yeah?

1020
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,160
- The one in my bergen.
- Yeah?

1021
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:10,080
Did you have anything to do with it?

1022
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:22,400
Here. It's my sweet.

1023
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:27,320
What colour is it, mate?

1024
01:48:34,520 --> 01:48:38,600
"It was green", "but I guess"
{y: I}you can't have everything.

1025
01:48:38,800 --> 01:48:42,080
{y: I}Back in the UK
"we had an outrageous piss"- "up."

1026
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:44,440
"Then the psychiatrist turned up to test us",

1027
01:48:44,640 --> 01:48:47,480
{y: I}looking for
"post"- "traumatic stress disorder."

1028
01:48:47,680 --> 01:48:51,280
{y: I}It turned out they were more
{y: I}strung out than we were.

1029
01:48:54,320 --> 01:48:57,520
"War is barbaric", "but if you think"
{y: I}this is the bit where I say

1030
01:48:57,720 --> 01:49:01,480
{y: I}I want to spend the rest of my days
"hugging trees", "don't hold your breath."

1031
01:49:01,680 --> 01:49:03,640
Hi!

1032
01:49:09,000 --> 01:49:10,480
Hi!

1033
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:28,000
{y: I}We're soldiers.
{y: I}It's my professión and I'm proud of it.

1034
01:49:28,200 --> 01:49:30,840
{y: I}Nobody said you had to be crap at it.

1035
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:34,560
"As for the men who tortured us" -
{y: I}they had a job to do as well

1036
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:38,520
{y: I}It's just that some of them
{y: I}enjoyed it a bit too much.

1037
01:49:38,720 --> 01:49:40,400
{y: I}lf I met any of them
"in the street tomorrow",

1038
01:49:40,600 --> 01:49:42,560
"and thought I could get away with it",

1039
01:49:42,760 --> 01:49:44,720
{y: I}I'd slot them.
