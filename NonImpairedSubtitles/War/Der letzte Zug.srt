5
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:18,831
Minister Gobbels and Minister Speer wants to give
Fuhrer our unique gift.

6
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,592
Berlin is almost cleaned of Jews!

7
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:28,318
Almost 70,000 Jews who have stayed there have been exported from Berlin.
It is the latter, who are still here.

8
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,550
Few of them  eventually disappear!

9
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:34,475
- Let's start today!
- The sooner, the better!

10
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,637

16
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,788
Come on, outside. Everything will be fine!
Faster. Put your shoes!

17
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,075
How it could happen, Henry?

18
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,072
- Henry Neumann?
- Yes.

19
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:53,517
Do not be afraidl. We'll take you there
to safety, where Mom and Dad will  work

20
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,513
to help the country in difficult times of war.

21
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,231
Why Mom and Dad can not work and stay here in Berlin?

22
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,114
Because where you go is much
safer, my little.

23
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,033
There will be lot of bombs.

24
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,955

25
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:19,397
- Luckily, I found it.
- A joke?

26
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:26,950
Yes! Even my smoking. You never know when it will come in handy.
Just never know!

27
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,235
- That you certainly will not be needed.
- I know a million of such jokes.

28
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:37,149
Please give me a topic now,
and I immediately tell you a joke

29
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:47,798
"I hear the sirens screaming, every body is running to
cover, except one man who ...

30
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:53,797
Who is seeking something in the house. His wife shouts
"Hurry up, what are you still looking?

31
00:03:54,320 --> 00:04:00,031
"My prosthetics course," he is responsible.
"Give me a break from protézama!" screaming woman

32
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,349
"Do you think that they bombard at our house?"

33
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:16,750
Get going! already! you Lose your time!

34
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:21,799
No, it is a wall of hard board! All of these apartments
They have the same size. But the rooms are smaller.

35
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,949
This wall is fake!

36
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,953
I am a doctor! Obstetrician! Thousands of German
Children came to me , Thousands!of them

37
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:34,113
Mom? Can't you tell them that you don't want to go?
- Unfortunately, not now.

38
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,393
You're a lucky! You are carrying
your little sister with you.
.

39
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:46,954
Are you alone?

40
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,873
My father, Dr. Friedl.

00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,632

42
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,519
What's his name?

43
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,995
Aaron.

44
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:02,998
Are you sure you are inside? Middle. I bet!

45
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:05,109
I knew it.

46
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,268
Bastard!

47
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:31,672
Come on, leave it!
You will no longer need to wear fur

48
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:36,073
- Please, take the fur,and let us go.
- Even though we are not married!

49
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,669

50
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,554
- You want to insult me, Jew?

51
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,278

52
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,639
Bloody Jewish pig!

53
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,516

54
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,030
Saint. Jewish saint!

55

All the wealth is left by my parents!
- How were your clients are, the Holy Jew?

56
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,754
Germans! Christians, Jews, I do not distinguish.

57
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:22,154
Be patient. On the train We give? No food and drink on the train.

58
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,789
No food no water! They sending us on vacation?

59
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,038
Do you know, where we are going?.

60
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,153
No, I do not know until we get there,

61
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,029
Jacob ... is already well ...

62
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:45,633
I performed in so many places, I counted them.
Over 350!

63
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,039
from small villages to large city theater!

64
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,430
Kings, queens, princess -...almost everyone laughed by this  Jew
Jacob Noschikovi.

65
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,148
Excluding to the fascists!
- Jakob, stop!

66
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,349
People in this world who does not
have a sense of humor.

67
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:09,997
Please wait. We give? No food and water on the train.

68
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,310

Could you kindly give me a time to speak a bit.

71
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,876
I was on the boxing match,
when you knocked Mr.Lehmann.

72
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:33,119
How many years have been passed? Ten?
- It seems it was in another life.

73
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:37,320
I got the axe and saw  in my trunk .

74
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,632
I just want to know who I can count on

75
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,433
I'm with you.

76
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,398
Do you gentlemen are brothers?

77
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,035
Yes.

00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,310

83
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:19,075
Please step away! Please step away from the track!
Attention! Away!

84
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,756
Do not drink, because our Fuhrer does not drink?

85
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:53,716
Once my mother knows that I drank
she gets angry.

86
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,114
But your mother is not going with you on this trip?

87
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,794
How many are there?

88
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,550
There are about

89
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,231
Now it's your problem.

90
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,910
Trains travel several days, what is the problem?

91
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,631
It's a big responsibility.

92
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:22,918
By this your transportation,
Capital Empire will soon be cleansed from Jews.

93
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,879
You can count on me.

- Heil Hitler.

96
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:39,589
Please quietly get into the wagon.
We all get water and food there.

97
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:44,835
I do not understand, Mom.

98
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,399

It will be all good, just hold on to me tightly.
Why do these gentlemen holding weapon?

100
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,713
In order to protect us.

101
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,430
- These are the coaches for the animals?
- No!

102
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:18,198
Freeze, Jewish pig!

103
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,956
Let me stop them!

104
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,678
Let me go! Do not force me!

Aaron? Where is Aaron?

139
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,952
Calm down, it is here, everything will be all right.

140
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:17,675
Dad, there must be water after all.
They said after that it will be no water.

141
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,678
Yes, they said.

142
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,436
There is a bucket of water in front of us for all.

143
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:29,359
Henry, we need to organize,
otherwise we'll kill each other.

144
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,398
Look, I am so sorry
that happened to your son

145
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:31,671
Why did not you take leave for few days?
- I tried it

146
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:38,315
but apparently
they found no other fireman.

147
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:43,396
I lost three sons in the war and did not get even
one fucking day off!

148
00:15:53,960 --> 00:16:05,553
And one and two, and three, and four ...

149
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:27,279
Mom, it seemed to me
I'm the best dancer in the world!

150
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:29,598
You will,
I swear.

151
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,110
- You swear?
- I swear.

152
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:43,909
Put the legs aside need to pass! I need to pass!

153
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,475
Henry!

154
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,594
- Yes?
- I need some water.

155
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:02,955
Me too!

156
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:11,076
Wait a moment! Please ..We will have to keep a record
on Paper and register those who got the water, and who is not.

157
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:16,235
A bucket of water stand next to you,
that does not entitle you to take when you want

158
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:17,748
I will no take more.

159
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:23,393
I am sixty years, and my husband
seventy and has severe diabetes.

160
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,238
Each of us needs water!

161
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:27,913
we will find a way to regulate it

162
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,310
Yes! Sure, right after your wife
gets the first drink!

163
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,476
Please! I want to say something

164
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:43,798
I know some of you to carry water
and a meal. ...., I think that those who have something

165
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:46,878
Should not use a common water until
consume their own supplies.

166
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:52,478
What are we talking about ? Water is not
much enough by tomorrow morning!

167
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,150
One bucket for all!

168
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,913
So I'll wait until the afternoon.
Then everyone will be able to drink.

169
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,479
And what about your wife?

170
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,788
She is Breast feeding! If she got no milk
the child could die.

171
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:16,511
Or anyone has any objection to the two mothers
who get little more water?

172
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:22,957
Or is there perhaps some other woman can breast feed,
instead of my wife Erika?

173
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:56,955
Thank you.

174
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,915
The wood is hard as steel, will never move.
Should We try those iron bars.

175
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,274
And then what?

176
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,476
We find the boy, who will stretch out of the window ...

177
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:17,993
Sticks his fingers into the gaps to keep.
Opens the door from outside and then we can jump!

178
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,914
Take care of her, I find the boy.

179
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:26,199
Of course the train must go slowly
otherwise it will be too dangerous.

180
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,753
come to me.

181
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:43,117
What Nina What's happening? Hungry?

182
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:45,914
We have some food, but we still
wait a bit longer ...

183
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,758
- I'm hungry.
- Just?

184
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,270
- she needs to eat ...
- Later ...

185
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,628
Oh, angelica.

186
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,354
We have her clean clothes. You take it?

187
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,198
Nothing happens baby,don't worry.

188
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:15,039
It's hot, as in Ethiopia, .
Or it has something to do with my age?

189
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,310
Once  its hot, later cold.

190
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,197
I am glad only that I've lost the sense of smell.

191
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:30,030
If you get water, we die.
Why do you tell a joke?

192
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:35,599
- I agree.
- And who know? I say "No". Go away, please!

193
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,952
I have with me several gold coins. When we get out
we can make a good use of them.

194
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:43,511
Do not stop me from it!

195
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:48,511
I warn you if  you come close to us,
I will kill you! Understand?!

196
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,395
I am from the Bar Mitzvah. I had a man!

197
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,790
Stop it! Approaching the station!

198
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,550
Bullshit!

199
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,996
On the other track coming passenger train
from Berlin! Beware!

200
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,033
Please! We need more water! Water, please!

201
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:42,368
We need water!

202
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:47,958
- Exceptionally well, congratulations!
- Shut up! His youngest died!

203
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:52,836
- My condolences.
I also lost a son in the first weeks of the war.

204
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:55,995
Water!

205
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,315
Go ... did not really need a water.

206
00:23:30,616 --> 00:23:31,016
Move on

207
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:41,156
Water, water! Please give us some water!

208
00:23:46,457 --> 00:23:48,957
do'nt stop
keep yeiling, we need water

209
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,518
Anyone else want some water?

210
00:23:57,519 --> 00:24:00,619
Now they don't need water any more any longer.

211
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,713
Albert! Can not just lie her there!

212
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,396
We'll put her in corner

213
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,514
let me do .

214
00:24:50,615 --> 00:25:01,815
Look this a Jew Sold it to me
for the crumbs of bread.

215
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,315
Saddle up! Ahead! We gotta go!

216
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:44,953
Come to America! You hear? You have to go to America!

217
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:52,719
- They have a lot of pianists, they do not need me!
- imigrate to America, right?

218
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:57,431
- And what will you do without a pianist, my dear?
- I must die of hunger. So?

219
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,114
With your taste?

220
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,434
Our relationship is over!
Leave now , i never want to see you.

221
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,878
I divorce  you! Simply you divorce me.

222
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:14,315
Stop, Jacob You already know,
that i will never leave you.

223
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,718
A Pianist....Look at these hands.

224
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,112
- Do you play?
- A little ...

225
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,238
What's happening? Why it stops?

226
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,594
What do we do when very afraid?

227
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:06,278
The first sentence of the prayer Shema Israel. This helps!

228
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:17,034
Well ... Shema Israel, Adonai Elheinu, Adonai
Echad ... Baruch ...............

229
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,155
I'm sorry, this a military transport. we preferred
occupie all the tracks!

230
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,480
How long this will  take?

231
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,480
Hours, days, God knows. trains Pass
in both directions. In any case, we must wait.

232
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:16,435
Shit, shit!

233
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,111
Mr. Perles we think about your
suggestion.

234
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,598
We all think that escape is not the best idea.

235
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:41,635
What do you think, where are they taking us,
is it Auschwitz?

236
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,595
It is not certain. but its sured,
that if we get caught, then all of us will be shot.

237
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,633
- In any case, try it.
- We should vote.

238
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,115
No vote! No discussion.
Once the opportunity arises, we must escape.

239
00:28:57,040 --> 00:29:00,589
Henry, boy, maybe you're right.

240
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,395
Would you like To throw their
children from a moving train?

241
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,038
While at the end of our destination there will be an
expensive hot meal and a roof over  head are waiting for us.
.

242
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,639
As the train starts,
we'll get to work.

243
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,197
It is about MY son!

244
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:20,313
Sooner or later, when it stop again,
do we need water and food.

245
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:24,519
It can not be so difficult
we give small sign to him when we see soldier

246
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:30,995
Silence! not a single word
shut your mouth.

247
00:29:30,996 --> 00:29:34,896
they will kill him
kill him

248
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:39,398
while passing If something happens to my child,
God will Take care of him.

249
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:48,931
They think I am feeding prohibited animals.

250
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,429
We will die of heat.

251
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,672
- I was completely dries.
- We have to get away.

252
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,517
not giving us no food or drink.
They do not care even if we gonna die!

253
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:11,871
But, they need us! You said
we're going to work!

254
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:15,516
They're so stupid to
keep us here to let us Die.

255
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,718
May God hear our words. If still exists.

256
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:22,554
And what will happen to those who can not work?

257
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:57,593
God ... God ... Where are you?

258
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,268
Stop!

259
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,999
Please think about your child, You must stop

260
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:11,315
Maybe we're lucky,
hope should not dies untill last.

261
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:15,753
You have to believe that we
will be all be happy, again

262
00:31:17,454 --> 00:31:19,054
Look at him ,he is smiling.

263
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:38,193
This is a princess. And waiting for your prince,
it comes to awaken with a kiss. Here, look.

264
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,555

265
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,113
- Ukrainian SS!

Real devils! We can only pray,
that they will not here In connection with us

267
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:13,112
It was quite dusty. Disaster!

268
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:19,079
- Please enter, please. It's a jeweler, like any other.
- Thank you ...

269
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:26,236
- Mr. Silberman is such an honor, an honor?

270

271
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:35,629
I told you this often ,
but you  did not listened.

272
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:41,280

We stay some time here .

275
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,712

302
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,312
I'll give you whatever you ask, if you get back
even pull the ball from the well.

303
00:39:45,400 --> 00:39:47,356
She said the beautiful girl.

304
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:52,894
"Let me eat with you at the table," said Frog.
"Let me sleep in bed with you.

307
00:39:57,840 --> 00:39:59,796
Frog princess said ...

- Gallows is not for us!

309
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,959
Their time has arrived a little

Good question.

317
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:30,237

Think of something nice. Also I will think of something nice.

369
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:33,995
When David was still in your belly?

370
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:40,110
You remember when we were lying
on the bed under those soft blankets .

371
00:54:42,960 --> 00:54:44,188
What are you doing?

372
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,558
You feel his kicking.

373
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,629
Out! Get out now!

374
00:55:39,160 --> 00:55:41,071
Hurry up! Set in a row!

375
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:50,198
Immediately surrender all knives and other tools.

376
00:55:51,800 --> 00:55:55,190
If we found any tools not surrendered
will be immediately shot.

377
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:08,955
Jews out!

378
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:05,109
You were about to escape
once? to shorten the trip?

379
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,550
No tools, Lieutenant!

380
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:09,995
Very interesting.

381
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:19,555
Can anyone tell me how to open the door?

382
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,078
Probably not well closed.

383
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:27,671
We slept, I know nothing, sir Say ...

384
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,074

385
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:38,078
What is your name, dear girl?

386
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:40,639

I do not believe you.

389
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,680
Doesn't your parents taught you not lie?

390
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,233
Small little girls who lie,
can happen bad things to them

391
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,592
Even such a beloved little girl like you.

392
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:02,114
And her parents can become too terrible things.

393
00:58:03,160 --> 00:58:04,070
No?

394
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,548
Yes, please sir?

395
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,518
I'm sure you like your mother.

396
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,198
Well let me ask again.

397
00:58:27,200 --> 00:58:29,919
Did you see the tools, you know whom it belongs.

398
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:34,155
Tell the truth and I'll bring
hot breakfast for you and your family.

399
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,909
I was asleep, was asleep.

400
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:57,712
Thank you sir,
You have very good manners.

401
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:01,557
I guess you're right, perhaps it's our fault.

402
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,549
Stupid lack of attention! But you can believe me.

403
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:08,713
This will no longer have to repeat.
Schmidt!

404
00:59:09,520 --> 00:59:11,556
Close the
double door and tie with wire.

405
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:17,839

406
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:21,877

408
00:59:32,600 --> 00:59:36,036
Please! can we finally get something to eat?

409
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,118
You do not leave us here to die.

410
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:45,114
No!

411
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:46,633

417
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:09,074
I've never met such a brave little girl
like you.

418
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:26,033
Henry? What do we do?

419
01:01:26,720 --> 01:01:29,154
Through the floor. At the rear, axles

420
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,033
It will take at least a day, not longer.

421
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:35,839
Every hour counts!
- Yes.

422
01:02:12,760 --> 01:02:13,909
Is he so hungry.

423

To fulfill the dream''.

427
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:54,275
What do you play?

01:02:55,360 --> 01:02:58,432
Sleeping Beauty Waltz . Close your eyes ...

429
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:56,992
Look, we're going back to Berlin!

430
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:09,069
Albert! You see anything?

431
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,874

It's not your fault.

505
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,676
I could not think that it will become
such a misfortune?

506
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:27,268
Back to work!

What about him?

512
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:47,194
Sometimes babies stop breathing, but it's just
a moment. It's normal. but This looks not normal.

513
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,312
We will continue all night.

514
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,157
Let us pray that we have enough time.

515
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,473

01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:16,632
Does it really do?

519
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:21,359
It can save David's life.

520
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:23,919
Will it harm?

521
01:19:26,720 --> 01:19:28,472
I think not, my angel.

522
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,190
I can not.

523
01:19:48,080 --> 01:19:49,513
We have nothing there.

524
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:08,194
I'm sorry. So sorry!

525
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:16,519

528
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:34,748
I need to rest.

529
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:12,759
How do you feel?

530
01:21:13,720 --> 01:21:17,918
Strong. In any case,
you're stronger than me.

531
01:21:32,520 --> 01:21:33,748
Your hands are like my grandmother's hands.

532
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:26,549
I am helpless

533
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:33,050
I feel so helpless

534
01:22:37,240 --> 01:22:38,468
Go to your mother.

535
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:49,353
Please. We need water!

536
01:22:51,000 --> 01:22:52,718

01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:59,231
- Give us water, we die of thirst!
- Just one word Jew and shoot you!

538
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:04,436
Please, even a sip. He is only 12 months!

539
01:23:04,760 --> 01:23:07,558
You will receive your food as soon as we get
to the next station.

540
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:14,118
But until then all gonna die!
coach is already full of corpses! Full of corpses!

541
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:17,318
At least be some water for those who are still alive.

542
01:23:32,120 --> 01:23:33,553
What song should I sing for?

543
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,157
Jacob, you're a crazy?

544
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:44,110
I can choose the audience.
These kids need food.

545
01:23:45,080 --> 01:23:46,195
You too ...

546

548
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:06,190
I can sing. I am a great comedian.

549
01:24:06,840 --> 01:24:12,756
Sing your beautiful song.
Or recite few verses from Goethe. What do you think?

550
01:24:34,760 --> 01:24:38,275
I'm hungry. Do you think that they give something?

551
01:24:42,240 --> 01:24:44,959

He is dead, leave him. Leave him alone!

585
01:32:21,400 --> 01:32:25,916
What's happening? Why is she crying?

- We need to prepare Nina.
