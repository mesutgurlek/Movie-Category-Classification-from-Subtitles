THE HEIR TO
GENGHIS KHAN

00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,913
A MEZHRABPOM-FILM Production

00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,073
Screenplay by O. BRIK
Based on the novel by I. NOVOKSHONOV

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,714
Directed by V. PUDOVKIN

5
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:02,699
Vast and deserted
are the lands of Central Asia.

6
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,028
Your master ready
to go to the market?

7
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,481
Master is sick.

8
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,219
The flag indicates...

9
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,574
...that praying for the health
of the yurta's owner are...

10
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,153
...a lama...

11
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,755
...a learned monk-healer...

12
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:40,773
...and a collector of taxes
for the monastery.

13
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:57,379
Very sick!

14
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,450
My son will go to the market...

15
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:16,717
The son.

16
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,453
Get ready to go to the market!

17
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,154
Saddle the horse!

18
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,059
Furs for sale.

19
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,430
A fine skin!

20
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:18,976
We'll get flour!..

21
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,618
We'll eat well
every day!..

22
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,650
Five hundred silver coins.

23
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,593
For healing the body...

24
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,149
...and the soul...

25
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,464
...a feasible reward.

26
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,156
Not enough!

27
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,849
Not enough!

28
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:41,233
The lama lost...

29
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,599
...a sacred amulet.

30
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,098
For the road.

31
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,110
Marketplace.

32
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,437
THOSE who buy for pennies...

33
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:12,835
...and gain millions.

34
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:22,917
THOSE who guard...

35
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,991
...the capital's interests.

36
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:32,809
A wonderful fox for sale
in the marketplace...

37
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,852
Furs are bought up here.

38
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,832
We'll eat
every day!

39
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,289
Next!

40
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,191
Give back my fox!

41
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,693
LET GO!

42
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,140
A WHITE MAN'S BLOOD
HAS BEEN SHED!

43
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,230
Go away!

44
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,939
Run!..

45
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,995
If in 24 hours...

46
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:44,113
...the criminal is not
delivered to the authorities...

47
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,451
...all population...

48
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,992
...will be exemplarily punished...

49
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,678
...and fined.

50
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:37,038
To the taiga.

51
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,573
In 1920...

52
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,359
...in the mountains...

53
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,578
...for the power of the Soviets...

54
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:32,898
...partisans were fighting.

55
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,049
They're closing in!

56
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:26,554
We got to go!

57
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,673
Must try to break through!

58
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:35,975
They're closing in!

59
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,139
The commander.

60
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,174
A miner
from the faraway Donbass.

61
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,253
Without any noise...

62
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,578
An accidental witness.

63
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,913
Thank you, comrade!

64
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:13,476
Watch out!

65
00:28:24,860 --> 00:28:25,670
WATCH OUT!

66
00:28:38,040 --> 00:28:38,916
WATCH OUT!

67
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,718
We got to run!

68
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:04,895
No horse.

69
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,395
Get on!

70
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,714
Camp.

71
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,173
Maintain communication...

72
00:35:11,220 --> 00:35:12,599
...with the Red Army...

73
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,599
Listen to...

74
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,215
...Moscow.

75
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:13,655
Listen to...

76
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:15,252
...Moscow.

77
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:05,156
To strengthen
ties with the population...

78
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,079
...the chief of occupation...

79
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,415
...and his wife...

80
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:36,515
...with the staff...

81
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,971
...are going to visit
a big monastery.

82
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:08,730
Diplomacy demands...

83
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:21,831
...special forms...

84
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:27,717
...and preparations.

85
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,056
Before leaving.

86
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,937
The chief ordered
to quickly collect

87
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:48,431
two hundred heads of cattle
from the nearest settlements.

88
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:57,879
Set out immediately!

89
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,570
It's a long way from the city
to the monastery...

90
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,234
The ties are planned.

91
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:20,837
The ties are worked out
by diplomacy.

92
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,876
The ties are strengthened
in practice.

93
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,516
Ride and tell them
that the soldiers are coming...

94
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,817
SACRED DANCES.

95
00:49:55,120 --> 00:50:00,750
Before the sunset, gather here
all the driven-away cattle!..

96
00:50:03,420 --> 00:50:04,470
...or...

97
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,091
By the animal trail.

98
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:36,409
Be prepared...

99
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:47,455
...to speak
on behalf of the Empire...

100
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:00,271
...with the great,
immortal lama...

101
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:11,299
...whose soul is forever passing
from a dead body to a new one...

102
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:52,875
BE PREPARED!..

103
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:58,650
...Himself...

104
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:08,295
...The great...

105
00:53:14,760 --> 00:53:15,993
...IMMORTAL...

106
00:53:18,980 --> 00:53:20,293
...WISE...

107
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,053
LAMA.

108
00:53:48,460 --> 00:53:53,778
The lama's soul recently
moved to a new body...

109
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:08,395
Although the Great One doesn't speak,
he understands everything.

110
00:54:38,220 --> 00:54:41,435
Diplomacy demands
mutual respect.

111
00:54:59,580 --> 00:55:05,909
My government sincerely regrets
your recent passing away...

112
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:20,313
...and gladly welcomes
your new reincarnation.

113
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:17,573
The road is dangerous...

114
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:21,838
...the Reds showed up...
leave immediately...

115
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:58,276
The Empire is confident of the strong
friendship of the Mongolian people.

116
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,557
We will hope...

117
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:31,418
...for the reciprocal observance
of our common interests.

118
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:54,811
You have to hurry...
very dangerous...

119
00:59:15,460 --> 00:59:19,592
In case of an encounter
with the friendly people.

120
01:00:03,940 --> 01:00:06,149
Calm down!..
They're ours.

121
01:00:14,260 --> 01:00:19,876
In view of a serious danger
we sent a convoy.

122
01:01:27,240 --> 01:01:30,735
A Mongolian partisan
has been caught...

123
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:34,791
This is what we found on him.

124
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:46,793
Are you a partisan?

125
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,252
A Red one?

126
01:03:03,240 --> 01:03:04,493
Moscow?

127
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:15,459
Shoot this beast.

128
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:14,917
Take him out of town and shoot him.

129
01:07:53,260 --> 01:07:54,534
Interpreter.

130
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:09,755
This is either a code,
or is written in an ancient language

131
01:08:09,960 --> 01:08:12,738
that I can't understand...

132
01:10:34,940 --> 01:10:39,894
A missionary specializing
in the ancient Mongolian language.

133
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:57,589
This is...

134
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,751
...an absolutely
extraordinary document!

135
01:11:27,720 --> 01:11:31,811
The deed indicates
that its owner...

136
01:11:33,140 --> 01:11:37,456
...is a direct
heir to Genghis Khan!

137
01:11:51,680 --> 01:11:53,291
Bring him back!

138
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,412
Bring him back!

139
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:35,876
Maybe he's alive!

140
01:14:12,680 --> 01:14:14,411
There is no body!

141
01:14:17,320 --> 01:14:19,131
Alive, alive!..

142
01:14:28,980 --> 01:14:30,559
ALIVE!

143
01:15:57,700 --> 01:15:58,555
Gentlemen!

144
01:16:18,640 --> 01:16:21,850
We must do
everything possible...

145
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:30,979
...to be able to take advantage
of the lucky find.

146
01:16:47,880 --> 01:16:51,678
We'll make him
the ruler of the country.

147
01:16:57,040 --> 01:17:00,628
Through him
we'll strengthen our power.

148
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:27,788
Let's try!

149
01:17:29,240 --> 01:17:31,137
We'll get support!

150
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:01,854
Ready!

151
01:18:25,760 --> 01:18:27,134
Long live...

152
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:30,969
...Asia...

153
01:18:34,160 --> 01:18:37,735
...under the powerful
patronage of the king!

154
01:18:43,900 --> 01:18:49,131
The ruler is getting better.

155
01:19:22,780 --> 01:19:26,275
We're training the soul
of the future ruler.

156
01:20:00,900 --> 01:20:03,016
Explain to him
that he became famous.

157
01:20:29,940 --> 01:20:36,439
Translate that the messengers
of sovereign princes are here.

158
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:04,195
My prince...

159
01:21:08,100 --> 01:21:09,652
...sends his submissiveness...

160
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:15,180
...and two thousand horsemen.

161
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:38,796
It looks like we got it well in hand?

162
01:22:15,400 --> 01:22:17,040
He's thirsty.

163
01:24:42,910 --> 01:24:44,459
The ruler has recovered.

164
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:49,115
Let him take a walk.

165
01:26:41,720 --> 01:26:46,077
Tell him that
tonight we'll demonstrate him.

166
01:27:02,700 --> 01:27:06,559
From the depth of the country,
after a successful trade...

167
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:10,515
...at last...

168
01:27:10,780 --> 01:27:13,638
To his cultured
compatriots.

169
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:49,436
The master isn't home.

170
01:28:03,500 --> 01:28:05,277
Hey, anybody here?

171
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:16,233
The lieutenant is at the Assembly.

172
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:38,278
Change and come here.

173
01:28:44,220 --> 01:28:45,917
Just a minute...

174
01:29:11,700 --> 01:29:13,099
At the Assembly.

175
01:29:39,400 --> 01:29:40,813
A daring hunter...

176
01:29:44,900 --> 01:29:46,970
...FROM THE WILD STEPPES...

177
01:29:56,840 --> 01:30:00,020
...With a skin of a killed animal...

178
01:30:59,920 --> 01:31:01,423
We brought him.

179
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:49,271
I demand...

180
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:55,597
...that the honour of white people...

181
01:32:58,780 --> 01:33:02,395
...be protected from the encroachments
of colored scoundrels.

182
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:17,511
By the power invested in me...

183
01:33:18,360 --> 01:33:19,679
...I ORDER...

184
01:33:19,840 --> 01:33:20,736
...you...

185
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:22,074
...TO LEAVE!

186
01:33:49,880 --> 01:33:51,732
It's necessary to prepare...

187
01:33:59,940 --> 01:34:02,693
...for the ceremonial meeting and...

188
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:09,847
...the announcement of the agreement.

189
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:17,379
Paragraph four.

190
01:34:20,580 --> 01:34:23,731
The ruler of the country
binds himself to let us have...

191
01:34:34,700 --> 01:34:37,692
...the best goods
at a minimal price...

192
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:03,033
The Empire binds itself...

193
01:35:03,980 --> 01:35:05,548
...to bolster his power...

194
01:35:29,740 --> 01:35:32,433
...to indefatigably care
for the people's welfare...

195
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:44,359
Add: piously
observing mutual interests...

196
01:35:58,120 --> 01:35:59,851
THE ARRESTED MAN
IS IN THE BASEMENT.

197
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:03,659
But I gave an order...

198
01:36:10,800 --> 01:36:14,215
Piously observing
mutual interests.

199
01:36:37,320 --> 01:36:39,290
Me not shoot!..

200
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:55,056
NOT SHOOT!

201
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:13,184
NO.

202
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,777
SHOOT HIM!

203
01:37:47,350 --> 01:37:48,136
He's biting!

204
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:50,116
DEVIL!

205
01:37:52,720 --> 01:37:53,530
SHOOT.

206
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:56,319
SHOOT NOW!

207
01:38:00,840 --> 01:38:02,558
SORRY, MADAME!..

208
01:39:07,820 --> 01:39:09,328
Down with the robbers!

209
01:39:35,340 --> 01:39:36,001
Down...

210
01:39:36,240 --> 01:39:37,116
...WITH THE BANDITS!

211
01:39:58,620 --> 01:39:59,994
DOWN...

212
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,280
...WITH THE THIEVES!

213
01:40:41,500 --> 01:40:42,774
To arms!

214
01:40:44,460 --> 01:40:45,529
CATCH HIM!

215
01:40:52,890 --> 01:40:53,829
DESTROY HIM!

216
01:43:18,020 --> 01:43:19,478
DOWN...

217
01:43:19,680 --> 01:43:20,999
...WITH THE WATCH...

218
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:22,348
...DOGS...

219
01:43:22,480 --> 01:43:23,695
...OF IMPERIALISM!
