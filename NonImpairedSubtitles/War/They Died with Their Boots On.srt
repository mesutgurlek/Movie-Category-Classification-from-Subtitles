1
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:17,233
We're new cadets, sir.

2
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:20,607
You're not cadets, and I'm not "sir."
Pull in your chin!

3
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,079
Stand at attention when you speak
to a noncommissioned officer!

4
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,478
- Brown.
- Yes, sergeant.

5
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:28,143
March these plebes to the office
for enrollment.

6
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:31,916
Yes, sergeant.
Detachment, forward march!

7
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:34,417
Keep those heads up!

8
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,119
Look to your fronts!
Pull in your chin!

9
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,925
Plebes, halt!

10
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,433
- New set of generals, captain?
- They're in the Army now, colonel.

11
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,562
- Fine-looking mess of manhood.
- About face!

12
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:52,368
Right face!

13
00:01:52,545 --> 00:01:55,013
Right face! Keep those heads up.

14
00:01:55,615 --> 00:01:56,980
Higher!

15
00:01:57,150 --> 00:01:58,378
Higher!

16
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:01,577
Forward and to double time, march!

17
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:04,552
Get those heads up. Pep it up there!
Pep it up!

18
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:06,624
Get your heads up!

19
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:15,291
- You're pretty fresh for a cadet, Sharp.
- Maybe I can afford to be, sergeant.

20
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:17,868
One day, you're gonna trip up
the wrong lad...

21
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:21,336
...find yourself on your face.
Your old man's money won't help.

22
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,373
That's the trouble with the Army...

23
00:02:23,543 --> 00:02:25,135
...makes no distinctions.
- No.

24
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:26,972
You're all alike here.

25
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:32,608
We don't say, "Welcome to West Point"
and turn out a guard in honor of any cadet.

26
00:02:32,785 --> 00:02:37,518
Here's somebody you'll turn out a guard for.
Must be a brigadier general, at least.

27
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:45,757
Some foreigner calling
on the commandant.

28
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,093
Turn out the guard. General officer.

29
00:02:48,268 --> 00:02:51,601
- Turn out the guard, general officer!
- Fall in!

30
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,034
Present arms!

31
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:06,415
Order arms!

32
00:03:11,524 --> 00:03:14,550
Welcome to West Point.
May I direct you to the commandant?

33
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:17,161
Yes, if he's the proper person
for me to see.

34
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,731
I'm Mr. Custer. George Armstrong Custer
of Monroe, Michigan.

35
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,767
I've been appointed to the academy
as a cadet.

36
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:26,805
Welcome to West Point.

37
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:29,271
- Nice work, sarge.
- Dismiss the guard!

38
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:33,674
- What are you waiting for? Take charge.
- I'll show you to your quarters.

39
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:36,610
- Will you follow me?
- What about these hounds?

40
00:03:36,783 --> 00:03:39,183
Oh, don't worry about them.
They'll follow me.

41
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,083
Unleash them, boy.

42
00:03:41,254 --> 00:03:43,119
And here's a dollar for yourself.

43
00:03:43,289 --> 00:03:45,223
Thank you, sir.

44
00:03:46,025 --> 00:03:50,758
Well. I've done four hitches in the U.S.
Cavalry. I thought I'd seen everything.

45
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:52,989
But if that isn't the stra...

46
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:57,830
- You favor cavalier boots, I see, Mr. Custer.
- That's because I'm going into the Cavalry.

47
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,598
An infantryman's no better
than a beast of burden.

48
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:02,832
You have definite ideas, Mr. Custer.

49
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:05,603
What made you honor the Army
by choosing it?

50
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,439
Glory, Mr. Sharp, glory.

51
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:10,208
I wanna leave a name behind
the nation will honor.

52
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:13,318
There's many more statues for soldiers
than civilians.

53
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:16,114
I'm sure you'll fit right in
with the statues...

54
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:18,257
...just like part of the horse.

55
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:21,521
Well, here we are, Mr. Custer.

56
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:26,688
Orderlies haven't moved Pinchbelly's
things yet.

57
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:30,302
But don't you worry, Mr. Custer,
we'll fix that right away.

58
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:36,066
- Will you give me a hand with this junk?
- Oh, certainly, Mr. Sharp.

59
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:38,676
I trust I'm not inconveniencing anybody.

60
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:42,337
Oh, no, no. On the contrary,
it's you who have been inconvenienced.

61
00:04:42,515 --> 00:04:44,039
Not at all.

62
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,344
Well, I hope you'll be comfortable here.

63
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:50,148
- As a first-year man, you don't rate a suite.
- No, of course not.

64
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:52,223
Well, confidentially, Mr. Sharp...

65
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:55,418
...these quarters are better than those
I'm accustomed to.

66
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:57,893
Oh, is that so?

67
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:01,659
My, that's a dashing-looking outfit
you're wearing, Mr. Custer.

68
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,324
Oh, thank you, Mr. Sharp.

69
00:05:03,503 --> 00:05:06,233
Yes, we've nothing
to compare with it here.

70
00:05:06,406 --> 00:05:11,070
Haven't you? Had it tailor-made in Monroe.
Wanted the folks to see me in uniform.

71
00:05:11,511 --> 00:05:15,311
- Did you design it yourself, Mr. Custer?
- No, but if you've a moment...

72
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,609
...I'll show you where I got the idea.
- Oh, certainly.

73
00:05:19,118 --> 00:05:20,346
Here.

74
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,819
One of the greatest heroes
who ever lived, Mr. Sharp.

75
00:05:23,990 --> 00:05:26,288
Murat, the king of cavalrymen.

76
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,860
He was known as the Thunderbolt,
and his one tactic was:

77
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:32,896
Ride to the sound of the guns.

78
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:36,400
I must get myself a tiger skin
as soon as possible.

79
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,059
- Quite a fellow.
- Oh, yes.

80
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:40,034
Well, I must be running.

81
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:43,664
I'm sorry, we can't make arrangements
for the dogs until tomorrow.

82
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:47,574
Oh, think nothing of it. They're accustomed
to sleeping with me anyway.

83
00:05:47,747 --> 00:05:50,341
Oh, and thanks very much
for your kindness to me.

84
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:05,553
Well, Caesar, what do you want?
Why, you know you don't like onions.

85
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:09,498
What's the matter with you?
Oh, you want your bones, eh? Come on.

86
00:06:09,669 --> 00:06:11,728
Come on. Come on.

87
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:15,237
Over here. Here, Caesar.
Come on, Hannibal. Come on.

88
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:18,775
Here you are. Here. Cleopatra.
There you are.

89
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:21,104
Here. There you are.

90
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:23,278
Hannibal!

91
00:06:44,203 --> 00:06:47,400
What the continental blue blazes is this?!

92
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,739
- Sorry.
- Sorry?

93
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,611
- I didn't hear you knock.
- You didn't hear me knock?

94
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,919
- Anything I can do for you?
- Yes, there is.

95
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,820
You can tell me what you and your
menagerie are doing in my quarters...

96
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,359
...why my effects have been
thrown out...

97
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:11,690
...from what asylum you escaped...

98
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:16,267
...and how you're here in that comic opera
uniform instead of at a fancy-dress ball.

99
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:17,733
Well, sir, explain!

100
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:20,532
My name's Custer,
Cadet George Armstrong Custer.

101
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:23,539
- I was assigned these quarters.
- You were, were you?

102
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:27,475
Well, I'm Major Romulus Taipe,
quartermaster and commandeer of cadets...

103
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:31,241
...and this happens to be my quarters.

104
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,442
And you're an imbecile.

105
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,951
Who brought you here?

106
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,181
Well, who brought you here?

107
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:41,588
I asked you a question.
Who brought you here? What's his name?

108
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,626
- Mudd.
- Mudd?

109
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,855
There's no such name at the academy.

110
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:49,661
Are you presuming to trifle with me?

111
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:51,463
Well, don't you hear that call?

112
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,400
It's inspection for new cadets.

113
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,598
Get out and fall in!

114
00:07:56,709 --> 00:08:01,146
I don't think your stay will be very long
with us, Mr. Custer.

115
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,182
I'm recommending you
for a mental examination.

116
00:08:06,185 --> 00:08:07,914
Get out! Get out!

117
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:10,385
Get out, confound it! Get out of here!

118
00:08:10,556 --> 00:08:12,353
Get out! Get out of here! Go on!

119
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:14,993
New cadets, fall in!

120
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,662
Get in line.

121
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,232
Straighten up that rank.

122
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,527
Prepare for inspection!

123
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,432
- Adjust your chin strap.
- Yes, sir.

124
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:36,006
What kind of sloppiness you call that?
Fix your belt. Take his name.

125
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,082
See that these men are instructed...

126
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:42,051
...in the proper way to wear their uniforms.
Extra drill, if necessary.

127
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:43,616
Yes, sir.

128
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,450
Eyes front, that man.

129
00:08:46,092 --> 00:08:49,061
- I said, eyes front!
- That means you, Marshal Murat.

130
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:56,359
Well, it's going to take even less time
to get rid of you than I suspected.

131
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,333
Put this maniac under arrest.

132
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:02,270
- Take him before Colonel Sheridan.
- Yes, sir. Right face!

133
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,103
Forward march!

134
00:09:14,787 --> 00:09:16,277
Mr. Custer...

135
00:09:16,455 --> 00:09:18,821
...you are charged
with a very grave offense.

136
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:20,982
Didn't you know striking a superior...

137
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:23,924
...is one of the most serious
of military offenses...

138
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:27,088
...punishable in some cases with death?

139
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:29,601
Why did you strike Mr. Sharp?

140
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:32,294
I'm afraid I can't say.
It was a personal matter.

141
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,770
There are no personal matters
on the parade ground.

142
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:38,202
Have you anything further to say?

143
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,844
No, sir.

144
00:09:40,012 --> 00:09:43,345
Then I have no alternative
but to dismiss you from the academy.

145
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:45,677
Dismiss?

146
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,549
I didn't know you could get fired
from the Army for fighting.

147
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,215
Well, you know it now.

148
00:09:57,330 --> 00:10:00,322
- What is your listing, Mr. Custer?
- Listing?

149
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,990
Yes, listing. It's on the form.

150
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:05,899
- The form you signed in the office.
- What form?

151
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:09,564
I didn't sign any form. I haven't been
to the adjutant's office.

152
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:13,041
Do you mean that you haven't subscribed
to the articles of war?

153
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:14,873
No, sir.

154
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:20,476
In that case, we certainly can't
fire you from the Army.

155
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,453
You're not in the Army. You've been lucky.
Let this be a lesson to you.

156
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,956
- Take him over to the adjutant.
- Yes, sir.

157
00:10:27,126 --> 00:10:29,617
- I'd like to thank...
- About face!

158
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,559
- I'd just like to...
- Forward march!

159
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,226
Thanks anyway, sir.

160
00:10:39,338 --> 00:10:42,330
You know, Taipe, I'm glad
it turned out this way.

161
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:46,410
- There's something about that fellow I like.
- Yeah?

162
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:48,911
Well, I don't know what it is.

163
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:52,050
You ask me, he'll make the worst record
of any cadet...

164
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:54,686
...since Ulysses S. Grant.

165
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:21,170
At full charge, a 12-pound shell will burst
into approximately 50 fragments.

166
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,512
- Mr. Custer!
- Yes, sir.

167
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,778
You know how many fragments
will a 12-pound shell burst?

168
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,484
Certainly not less than two, sir.

169
00:11:40,199 --> 00:11:42,326
Harold McCord.

170
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,802
Ronald McKenzie.

171
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,004
Francis Dupont.

172
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,576
- Congratulations, Mr. Dupont.
- Thank you, sir.

173
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,269
Edward Sharp.

174
00:11:54,447 --> 00:11:56,039
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

175
00:11:56,215 --> 00:12:00,914
I never thought I'd envy that toad,
graduating ahead of me.

176
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,386
- I'd certainly like to be in his boots today.
- Why?

177
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,819
Why?

178
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:10,257
Because if Lincoln gets elected there's
gonna be a war. Sharp will be in it.

179
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:13,159
Bunkum. It's all talk, Custer.
There'll be no war.

180
00:12:13,332 --> 00:12:15,197
No? Well, you wait and see, Rosser.

181
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:18,996
I tell you, if Lincoln gets elected,
the South will fight.

182
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,350
Battalion...

183
00:12:42,528 --> 00:12:44,621
...ten-hut!

184
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:48,927
You are about to hear an order by a civilian
member of the national government.

185
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:51,168
Senator Smith.

186
00:12:51,337 --> 00:12:55,000
Gentlemen, because of a present crisis
in the affairs of the nation...

187
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,267
...which menaces armed rebellion...

188
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,776
...and destruction of the union
established by our fathers...

189
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,404
...it has been decreed by Congress
that every officer and cadet...

190
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:08,041
...shall subscribe his name
to the following oath:

191
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,951
"I swear to maintain and defend
the sovereignty of the United States...

192
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:18,529
...as paramount to all allegiance or fealty
I may owe to any state or territory...

193
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,831
...so help me God."

194
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:27,098
Any officer or cadet who finds himself
unable to comply with its requirements...

195
00:13:27,273 --> 00:13:29,741
...will fall out to the right
of the battalion.

196
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,579
Gentlemen of the South, fall out!

197
00:13:48,427 --> 00:13:52,727
I see I was not misinformed as to
the preponderance of traitors at West Point.

198
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:56,834
It's high time that Congress acted
to clean out this nest of secessionists.

199
00:13:57,002 --> 00:14:00,403
We don't concern ourselves
with the making of wars here, senator.

200
00:14:00,573 --> 00:14:02,473
Only the fighting of them.

201
00:14:02,641 --> 00:14:05,576
The academy leaves each man
to his own sense of honor.

202
00:14:05,744 --> 00:14:08,110
Gentlemen of the South, fall in!

203
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:13,808
United States Military Academy...

204
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:16,454
...close to the left!

205
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:27,161
Gentlemen, I am sorry that our comradeship
must end in these unhappy circumstances.

206
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,267
We have lived as soldiers...

207
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:32,529
...and politics have had no place
among us.

208
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,805
Let us part then as we have lived:

209
00:14:34,974 --> 00:14:40,537
In the determination to do our duty,
wherever it may lie.

210
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:46,582
- Have we your permission to move off?
- Move off, Captain Fitzhugh Lee.

211
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,344
Shoulder...

212
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,420
...arms!

213
00:14:51,290 --> 00:14:54,589
Bandmaster, sound "Dixie"!

214
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:00,798
Company, left...

215
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:02,228
...face!

216
00:15:03,335 --> 00:15:05,394
Battalion...

217
00:15:05,771 --> 00:15:07,500
...march!

218
00:15:19,184 --> 00:15:21,277
Eyes left!

219
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:22,852
Present arms!

220
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,753
Forward!

221
00:15:44,710 --> 00:15:47,770
Frankly, I dislike the idea
of graduating junior classmen.

222
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:52,043
Emergency or no emergency, a half-baked
officer is worse than none at all.

223
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,515
But I couldn't make
the War Department see.

224
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:59,488
- At least the selection is left in our hands.
- Let's take them alphabetically. Who's first?

225
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:02,593
- Cadet Percival Anderson.
- Anderson.

226
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,922
Doesn't seem to have made
much impression.

227
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:09,625
Anderson's not the conspicuous type, sir.
But his record speaks for him. No demerits.

228
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:13,135
That might mean he's devoted himself
to keeping out of trouble.

229
00:16:13,305 --> 00:16:15,830
Anderson will be the better off
for another year.

230
00:16:16,008 --> 00:16:18,943
As a senior, he'd accept responsibility,
make decisions.

231
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:20,840
- I know, sir, but...
- Next!

232
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:22,776
George Armstrong Custer.

233
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,042
Well, there's nothing inconspicuous
about him, is there?

234
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:28,152
No, sir, nothing.
Nothing at all.

235
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,380
He has no regard for discipline,
organization, nor tactics.

236
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,252
And as for his record...

237
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:37,361
...George Armstrong Custer has the lowest
marks and the highest demerits...

238
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:42,432
...of any cadet who ever attended
this academy, including Ulysses S. Grant.

239
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:46,604
I wonder what happened to Grant.

240
00:16:47,139 --> 00:16:48,401
Well, what about Custer?

241
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:51,236
He's the best rider
and the best swordsman we have.

242
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:54,140
He seems endowed
with a singular aggressiveness.

243
00:16:54,313 --> 00:16:59,216
- A singular aggressiveness.
- The type that wins brawls, not battles.

244
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,821
- I tell you, sir, if you...
- What is your opinion of his quality?

245
00:17:02,988 --> 00:17:05,548
A squadron would follow him to hell.

246
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,656
You're forgetting yourself, sergeant.

247
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:13,159
As I was saying, sir, Custer's the type
that wins brawls, not battles.

248
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:18,167
Right at this very moment, he's doing
a punishment tour for his latest escapade.

249
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,103
Carry that rifle properly
and quicken the pace.

250
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,710
- Why? Nobody's looking.
- Quiet! You're not allowed to talk...

251
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,350
...on punishment tour!

252
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:33,883
Move on!

253
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:53,203
I hope you won't think me bold
addressing a stranger...

254
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:57,399
...but I'm Elizabeth Bacon of Monroe,
and I think I'm lost.

255
00:17:57,576 --> 00:18:00,067
Oh, but I'm speaking to you.

256
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,145
I'm trying to find Sheridan's house.

257
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,908
My father has business
at the commandant's office.

258
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:08,576
He thought he'd be a while, so he told me
to find the house myself.

259
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:11,086
Well, you see how I've found it.

260
00:18:11,256 --> 00:18:14,020
It sounds silly getting lost,
but it's a big place...

261
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:17,651
...and I've never been here,
and I've forgotten all my directions.

262
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:20,230
I took that path over there
by the garden...

263
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:24,802
...and when I got in the middle,
I turned to admire the view...

264
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:33,300
Really, sir. I've been just as carefully
brought up as you have...

265
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,913
...and I think if I can speak
to a stranger...

266
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:40,177
...the least you can do is to reply,
particularly when that stranger's a lady.

267
00:18:40,352 --> 00:18:42,843
I've told you who I am
and where I come from...

268
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:46,684
...and what my father's business is here,
and that, in an emergency...

269
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,588
...should be introduction enough.

270
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:54,062
And the least you can do is stand still
when I'm speaking to you. That's better.

271
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:05,170
I've never been so outrageously treated
in my life!

272
00:19:05,344 --> 00:19:08,040
I thought West Point
was a place for gentlemen!

273
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:11,046
I thought our Army was
the flower of our country!

274
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:14,845
I shall tell my father about this.
I shall tell Colonel Sheridan!

275
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,420
Oh, you needn't start back now.
It's too late.

276
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:23,653
You can rehearse all the apologies you like,
but I shan't stay here to listen. Good day.

277
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,669
Mr. Custer.

278
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:37,332
You're wanted at the commandant's office.
Get there at the double.

279
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,478
- Right. Hang on to this.
- That isn't the right direction!

280
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,136
Oh, yes, it is!

281
00:19:42,314 --> 00:19:44,441
Miss Bacon!

282
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,777
Miss Bacon. Please, you don't understand.

283
00:19:46,952 --> 00:19:49,546
I couldn't speak to you.
It's against regulations.

284
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,780
Do you understand?

285
00:19:52,424 --> 00:19:54,153
Halt!

286
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:59,794
If you're looking for Colonel Sheridan's
house, this is the right way.

287
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:03,134
I'm very sorry if I seemed rude...

288
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,794
...but while you're walking guard duty,
you're not allowed to talk.

289
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:10,305
- Well, then why didn't you say so?
- Well, I couldn't speak.

290
00:20:10,709 --> 00:20:15,078
- Oh, you mean you couldn't speak!
- No! I mean, yes! I couldn't.

291
00:20:20,819 --> 00:20:22,719
Well, thank you very much, sir.

292
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,857
And now that I've reached
my destination...

293
00:20:26,391 --> 00:20:27,619
Oh, Miss Bacon?

294
00:20:28,327 --> 00:20:31,819
Please don't go inside yet.
There's something I want to say to you.

295
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:34,727
See, I'm from Monroe too.
I haven't time to talk.

296
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:37,596
I'm due at the office.
If I keep Sheridan waiting...

297
00:20:37,769 --> 00:20:39,600
Tell Uncle Phil you were with me.

298
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,739
- Uncle Phil?
- Colonel Sheridan.

299
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,238
Oh, is he your uncle?

300
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,002
Not exactly, but he and my father
are old friends.

301
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:49,636
- When I was little, I used to sit on his knee.
- Oh, I see.

302
00:20:49,815 --> 00:20:52,283
I'm certainly glad
you never sat on my knee.

303
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,011
- Sir?
- Oh, I don't mean it that way, Miss Bacon.

304
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:57,678
If you'd been little enough
to sit on my knee...

305
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,916
...you'd be too old for me now...
I mean I'd be too old now.

306
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:04,622
Look, Miss Bacon, I really must go now...

307
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:08,357
...but do you think if I were
to come past your house around 9:00...

308
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,832
...you might be just sitting around
on the veranda?

309
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:14,436
Life is full of surprises.

310
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:19,066
And if I did find you sitting on the porch,
perhaps you and I could go for a walk.

311
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:23,445
We seem to have been walking together
ever since we've met.

312
00:21:24,249 --> 00:21:27,741
I can't imagine, ma'am, if I may say so,
any pleasanter journey...

313
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:30,945
...than walking through life
with you beside me, ma'am.

314
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,023
I must go now.

315
00:21:45,737 --> 00:21:47,637
Cadet Custer, reporting as ordered.

316
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,866
- Have you any idea why I sent for you?
- No, sir.

317
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:53,511
Do you know that you have
the worst record...

318
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:56,170
...that West Point has had in years?
- Yes, sir.

319
00:21:56,348 --> 00:21:58,248
- Why?
- I don't know, sir.

320
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,214
That's been puzzling me too.

321
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:06,349
Since you can't answer that, tell me why,
on the eve of your chance to graduate...

322
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:09,153
...you become involved in a brawl
with a civilian.

323
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,057
- It wasn't a civilian, sir.
- What?

324
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:13,527
Oh, no. Just a Marine.

325
00:22:13,699 --> 00:22:15,132
Well, Marine or civilian...

326
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:19,600
...unbecoming for a West Point cadet
to engage in fisticuffs on a public street.

327
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:22,535
Only extreme provocation
could call for such conduct.

328
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:26,974
It was. He said he'd been through two wars
and never seen a dead cavalryman.

329
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,579
What? Why...

330
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:32,410
Well, I trust when he recovers
from your reproof...

331
00:22:32,584 --> 00:22:37,453
...that he'll be taken to the cemetery and
shown the grave of "Lighthorse Harry" Lee.

332
00:22:39,991 --> 00:22:41,253
Mr. Custer...

333
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,361
...I suppose you had hoped to graduate
with your class?

334
00:22:44,529 --> 00:22:47,692
- Yes, sir.
- And if you had, what were your plans?

335
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,302
An assignment to the 2nd Cavalry.
Finest regiment in the Army.

336
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:55,304
But there won't be any vacancies
if the others beat me to Washington.

337
00:22:55,474 --> 00:22:58,739
In that case, I suggest you leave
on the next train.

338
00:22:58,910 --> 00:23:02,209
- Sir? You mean, I...
- You are the last of the class to graduate.

339
00:23:02,748 --> 00:23:05,740
The others have already received
their diplomas.

340
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:09,644
- Thank you, sir.
- I trust your future conduct...

341
00:23:09,821 --> 00:23:12,984
...as an officer of the Army
will justify my confidence.

342
00:23:13,158 --> 00:23:14,591
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

343
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,155
And now...

344
00:23:17,329 --> 00:23:19,889
...that train leaves in an hour.
- Yes, sir.

345
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,657
In an hour, sir?

346
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:26,429
- I'm afraid I'll have to catch the late train.
- What? Why?

347
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,303
Well, I...

348
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:32,273
Well, I sent my laundry out yesterday,
and it hasn't come back yet, sir.

349
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,608
You've been running three years
to catch that train.

350
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:37,715
I suggest that you keep on running.

351
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:40,317
- Yes, sir, but...
- With or without your laundry.

352
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:43,010
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir.

353
00:24:02,474 --> 00:24:04,408
Oh, Father.

354
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,875
Hello, my dear.

355
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:09,646
Back from your walk already?

356
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:18,585
- What are you doing sitting here alone?
- Such a lovely night. I didn't want to go in.

357
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:21,988
Sounds as if you're falling in love with...

358
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,128
...West Point.

359
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,854
Oh, it's a beautiful place.

360
00:24:26,031 --> 00:24:30,263
Especially when you have a handsome cadet
to show it to you in the moonlight.

361
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:33,328
I didn't go for my walk.

362
00:24:33,505 --> 00:24:34,802
Why not?

363
00:24:34,973 --> 00:24:37,407
- He didn't come back.
- He didn't come...?

364
00:24:37,576 --> 00:24:39,510
Why, the young scoundrel!

365
00:24:39,678 --> 00:24:43,808
A cadet is supposed to be an officer
and a gentleman. I'll speak to Sheridan.

366
00:24:43,982 --> 00:24:47,281
- The insolent puppy.
- You mustn't talk like that.

367
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,910
- And why not?
- Because he's the man I'm going to marry!

368
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:16,442
- How does the adjutant general feel?
- He's barking like a fox.

369
00:25:19,885 --> 00:25:23,082
- Any orders for me yet, corporal?
- No, Lieutenant Custer.

370
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:29,654
I'm sick of hanging around
to see the adjutant general.

371
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:34,788
I've written him time after time for
an assignment. I don't get any answer.

372
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:37,230
By Judas, I'm going in
to see him in person.

373
00:25:37,402 --> 00:25:41,429
- He'll see no one except by appointment.
- He won't, eh?

374
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:17,632
Help! Fire!

375
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:19,538
Spies!

376
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,406
Sabotage!

377
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,104
What is all this...?

378
00:26:23,281 --> 00:26:26,717
Get the fire brigade! Get water!
Get water, you idiots!

379
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,415
Don't let anybody in or out!

380
00:26:34,292 --> 00:26:36,852
- Well...
- Why, Major Taipe.

381
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:38,620
I'm very glad to see you, sir.

382
00:26:38,797 --> 00:26:41,561
Would you mind saying a word
to the adjutant general?

383
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:47,433
- I've been waiting weeks to be assigned...
- I have a feeling you're responsible for this.

384
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,801
But it will serve you to no purpose...

385
00:26:49,975 --> 00:26:53,206
...because I happen to be
the adjutant general.

386
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:57,472
I happen to be well aware that
you've been awaiting for orders...

387
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,378
...and you'll continue to wait...

388
00:26:59,551 --> 00:27:03,112
...until every competent officer
has been assigned to active duty.

389
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:07,156
And then, Mr. Custer,
I may find a place for you...

390
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:10,761
...training infantry recruits! Good day!

391
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,631
Ain't done much with your soup.
Don't like?

392
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,770
- No, it's all right, but you can take it away.
- Yes, sir.

393
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:23,533
Got something over here that'll excite
your palate, yes, sir.

394
00:27:23,708 --> 00:27:25,539
Creamed onions.

395
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,502
Specialty of the house, sir.

396
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,205
Ever since President Andrew Jackson's
time.

397
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:32,816
Say, waiter...

398
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,680
...isn't that General Scott,
General Winfield Scott?

399
00:27:35,854 --> 00:27:39,255
- How do you do, Charles?
- Very well. Kind of late today, general.

400
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:42,018
These are busy times, Charles.
Busy times.

401
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:45,861
Yes, sir, that's the general.
Commander in chief.

402
00:27:46,031 --> 00:27:49,091
A powerful-eating gentleman, sir.

403
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:51,394
Only time for a snack, Charles.

404
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:55,562
I'll have my hors d'oeuvres, soup,
double rib sirloin, potatoes au gratin...

405
00:27:55,740 --> 00:28:00,177
...asparagus, spiced pears and, of course,
the creamed Bermuda onions.

406
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:04,509
I'm desolate, general. The last portion
of Bermuda onions just been served.

407
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,117
I'll prepare more myself,
if you'll just wait.

408
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:09,913
Wait, man? With the Southern patrol
at Manassas?

409
00:28:10,088 --> 00:28:12,420
This is war, Charles, war.

410
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:15,559
- I'll order the sweet later.
- Yes, sir.

411
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,790
Pardon me, sir. Mr. Custer, sir.

412
00:28:19,964 --> 00:28:24,230
I couldn't help overhearing what you said.
These onions have just been served me.

413
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:29,305
- I'd deem it a pleasure if you'd accept them.
- That's generous, but I couldn't deprive you.

414
00:28:29,474 --> 00:28:31,999
That is, of all of them.

415
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:35,078
- Will you lunch with me, Mr. Custer?
- Thank you, sir.

416
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:39,940
That's a good one, sir.

417
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:43,610
You mentioned having no appetite.
How do you account for that?

418
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,080
I think I lost it in the adjutant's office.

419
00:28:47,258 --> 00:28:50,022
Camping around for weeks
waiting for an assignment...

420
00:28:50,195 --> 00:28:54,188
...and all the time, the rebels rolling down.
- Indeed.

421
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,333
How did you do at West Point?

422
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:59,902
Well, sir, first in equitation, sir,
first in swordplay.

423
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,299
And studies?

424
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,833
I was afraid you'd ask that, sir. Last.

425
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:10,845
Confidentially, young man, I saw
the West Point examination papers myself.

426
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:14,712
The only question I could answer was,
"Name the commander in chief...

427
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:17,184
...of the United States Army."

428
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:24,561
Mr. Custer, I think you better walk across
the street with me...

429
00:29:24,729 --> 00:29:27,323
...as soon as we've disposed
of the Bermudas.

430
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:28,830
Right, sir.

431
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,399
What...?

432
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:36,666
- It's a fatal mistake to steam onions.
- Even when they're sealed in containers?

433
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:39,332
Under any circumstances.
You steam the best out.

434
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:42,275
General, you certainly know your onions.

435
00:29:43,314 --> 00:29:45,612
Hold him here, Jones.
I may need him later.

436
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:50,244
Mr. Taipe, you're the man we want to see.
Post this officer to the 2nd Cavalry.

437
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:54,187
I know they have a vacancy.
I drew on them for an aide this morning.

438
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:57,556
- Yes, sir.
- You have no objections to the 2nd.

439
00:29:57,729 --> 00:30:00,789
If there's a finer regiment,
someone will have to raise it.

440
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:04,731
- When are you to report?
- Tonight. Second may be going into action.

441
00:30:04,903 --> 00:30:06,700
I can promise you it will, my boy.

442
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:10,705
It's impossible for him to report tonight.
There isn't a horse to be had.

443
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:14,971
If there is no horse, make the order
to report at the officer's first ability.

444
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:16,943
Very well, sir.

445
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:20,141
Sorry to disappoint,
but you'll see action soon enough.

446
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:22,309
- Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

447
00:30:29,527 --> 00:30:33,827
- This is General Taipe's horse.
- My compliments. And get out of my way!

448
00:30:42,607 --> 00:30:45,041
Custer. Second lieutenant,
reporting for duty.

449
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:46,871
- Glad to have you.
- Thank you.

450
00:30:47,045 --> 00:30:48,945
- Mr. Custer, gentlemen.
- Hello.

451
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:51,013
- Pleased to meet you.
- Have a drink.

452
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,743
- Thank you.
- Here's to bloody war and quick promotion.

453
00:30:54,919 --> 00:30:57,854
You bet! A fellow ought to
come out of this a major.

454
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,320
- You're quite an optimist.
- Just feel lucky.

455
00:31:00,491 --> 00:31:03,551
It'll take more than luck
with your grades in tactics.

456
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,696
- Hello, Sharp.
- You know each other?

457
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,355
General Blowhard and I
were at academy together.

458
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:13,300
Sure, that's right, sir. Now, there's a face
I always like to shake hands with.

459
00:31:13,938 --> 00:31:16,771
Better be circumspect
with your squadron commander.

460
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:21,537
He had. You may have buffaloed through
West Point, but you'll toe the mark here.

461
00:31:21,813 --> 00:31:23,144
Attention!

462
00:31:23,314 --> 00:31:25,282
All right, gentlemen, as you were.

463
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,713
Mr. Custer, sir, just reported.

464
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,116
Well, you arrived
at an opportune moment.

465
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:33,086
We're moving on Manassas Junction,
attacking at 4 a. m.

466
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:36,022
Four a. m.? Good! We'll have them
on the run by 4 p. m.

467
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:39,459
I knew as soon as I got down here,
things would start moving.

468
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,233
Come on, men! Forward!

469
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:48,196
Dismount! Prepare to fight on foot!

470
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:02,176
Skirmishes. Guide center.
Forward.

471
00:33:11,089 --> 00:33:13,990
What are you doing, Custer?
Retreat on Centerville.

472
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:16,183
Holding that bridge until
infantry gets across.

473
00:33:16,361 --> 00:33:20,730
You had your orders.
G-Troop. Prepare to retire.

474
00:33:20,898 --> 00:33:22,559
As you were, G-Troop.

475
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,362
I'm in command, Custer,
as long as I can stand.

476
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:27,504
That suits me.

477
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:32,438
Come on, men.
Let's take that bridge.

478
00:33:41,252 --> 00:33:43,243
Ready. Aim. Fire.

479
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,659
Charge.

480
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:03,863
Fire.

481
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,417
Forward.

482
00:34:27,398 --> 00:34:28,990
Forward.

483
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:38,903
- Oh, Custer, it's you. Good work.
- General Sheridan. General Sheridan.

484
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,137
- But you're hit, my boy.
- Yeah, I guess I am.

485
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:47,182
We can't grudge you a couple weeks in the
hospital and chance to go home. Good luck.

486
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:53,346
- Now this hand.
- Ladies, please, please. Isn't that enough?

487
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:56,584
Florence Nightingale had 30 nurses
to take care of an army.

488
00:34:56,761 --> 00:34:58,524
Takes four of you to give me a bath.

489
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:02,154
Lieutenant, we want you to
look your best when you get your medal.

490
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:05,769
I don't want a medal. I want a
beefsteak and a bottle of bourbon.

491
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,871
Attention.

492
00:35:08,306 --> 00:35:10,001
At ease.

493
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:14,267
- Hello, Custer. How are you, my boy?
- Oh, terrible, sir, terrible.

494
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:18,142
I get groomed and curried by
these nice ladies eight hours a day, sir.

495
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:22,582
That's one of the horrors of war, my boy.
Never mind. You'll be out of here soon.

496
00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:25,950
Mr. Custer, when an officer
disobeys orders in action...

497
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,183
...there can be
one of two consequences:

498
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:30,327
A firing squad or a medal.

499
00:35:30,495 --> 00:35:34,022
You seem to have drawn
the medal. This time.

500
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:37,431
Thank you, sir.
That kind of balances me up.

501
00:35:37,602 --> 00:35:41,060
Ounce of lead in my right shoulder,
an ounce of silver on my left.

502
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:44,572
- Is there anything else you need?
- Yes, there is one thing, sir.

503
00:35:44,742 --> 00:35:46,801
- What's that?
- A letter of introduction.

504
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,446
- To whom?
- To a Mr. Bacon, sir. Of Monroe.

505
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:53,277
- I understand he's an acquaintance of yours.
- Yes, he is. He...

506
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:54,748
But you're from Monroe.

507
00:35:54,919 --> 00:35:58,184
- You ought to know Mr. Bacon.
- I'm not from his side of town.

508
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,622
I see. All right, my boy.

509
00:36:01,792 --> 00:36:04,124
- I'll write that letter.
- Thank you, sir.

510
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:06,923
I don't suppose you
happen to know that...

511
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,896
...Mr. Bacon is the father
of a pretty young woman?

512
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:11,500
Oh, is that so?

513
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,966
Well, take care of that shoulder.
Good luck, my boy.

514
00:36:15,139 --> 00:36:16,766
Thank you, sir.

515
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,836
Squad, at ease.

516
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:25,381
Ladies, I owe you a debt of gratitude
that no words of mine can ever repay.

517
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,917
Your ministrations performed
a miracle and hastened my recovery.

518
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,350
Thank you, Lieutenant Custer.

519
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,720
And now, I'm getting up.

520
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,458
- Oh, no. What?
- Lieutenant, you can't. You mustn't.

521
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:41,291
- Oh, but I can and I must.
- Oh, no.

522
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:44,900
- You're not well enough.
- Squad, attention.

523
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:51,805
Ladies, I bid you a fond farewell.
Squad, at ease.

524
00:36:51,976 --> 00:36:55,343
- What are we going to do?
- Lieutenant Custer, come back here.

525
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:58,601
That's a fine song, sir. What is it?

526
00:37:59,377 --> 00:38:02,505
A brother cavalier, what? Butler, sir.

527
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,944
"Queen's Own" Butler they call me.

528
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:09,416
Late of the 5th Royal Lancers,
presently of the 1 st Michigan Cavalry.

529
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:12,522
- Very happy. Custer, 2nd U.S. Cavalry.
- Custer?

530
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,250
- I say, not the bloke at Bull Run?
- Yeah.

531
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,155
- Won't you sit down, sir?
- Thanks.

532
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:22,129
Hi there, tapster. Unlimber that old spigot
arm of yours. There are pots to be tossed.

533
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,666
- Won't you join us in a drink?
- No, thanks.

534
00:38:24,835 --> 00:38:27,065
Mustn't have liquor on my breath today...

535
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,502
...but I'd be glad to buy
you gentlemen a round.

536
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:32,199
Tell me, how did you join
the 1 st Michigan?

537
00:38:32,376 --> 00:38:35,641
Well, I couldn't spell Connecticut.

538
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,305
It speaks for itself, eh?
But, sir, you asked about the song.

539
00:38:39,483 --> 00:38:41,417
The name is "Garryowen."

540
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:46,318
And the 5th Royal Lancers rather fancied it
because it goes jolly well on a horse.

541
00:38:48,959 --> 00:38:51,928
- I'd like to learn that song.
- I'm the lad to teach you.

542
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:54,055
All right, boys, together now.

543
00:39:01,205 --> 00:39:02,866
Oh, good day, Mr. Bacon.

544
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:04,769
Oh, good day, Mr. Cartwright.

545
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:09,470
I hardly expected to meet you in this part
of town. I'm down here collecting the rent.

546
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:13,549
Whenever it falls due, I wish my family
had never acquired the property.

547
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:17,654
When the lease is up, I intend to see
the new tenant puts it to better use.

548
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:21,258
That is a consummation
devoutly to be wished.

549
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:24,553
- It's a blot upon the face of our community.
- Yes, yes.

550
00:39:24,729 --> 00:39:28,028
- Well, good day, Mr. Bacon.
- Good day.

551
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,369
You.

552
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,032
Tell Mr. Sullivan
I wish to see him on business.

553
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,678
Find him yourself. I'm busy.

554
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:46,442
How dare you address me with
such insolence? I'm here to collect the rent.

555
00:39:51,422 --> 00:39:54,914
- Be quiet, you drunken riffraff.
- Riffraff?

556
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:57,219
I advise you to be
careful of your words.

557
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,989
I'd advise you to be
more careful of your uniform.

558
00:40:00,164 --> 00:40:02,564
Bringing disgrace on it
with drunken behavior.

559
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:07,397
What? Drunken?
Why, you fat little pipsqueak.

560
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:09,004
This gentleman's a soldier.

561
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:13,872
He stands in battle and gets shot at so that
sanctimonious little skinflints like you...

562
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:16,774
...can run around in safety
doing business as usual.

563
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:21,441
And if he wants to get drunk while he's
on leave, what business is it of yours?

564
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:25,385
Hear, hear. That's telling the old blighter
where he gets off, eh, what?

565
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:28,320
If you don't like our society,
why barge in on it?

566
00:40:28,492 --> 00:40:33,828
I'm here because I prefer to collect the rent
of this establishment personally...

567
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:39,026
...rather than expose my clerks to such
an atmosphere of degrading debauchery.

568
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:44,469
Degrading debauchery?
The chap's quite an orator, what?

569
00:40:44,675 --> 00:40:48,111
Your conduct is only what
I would expect from a foreigner.

570
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:52,340
But as for you, sir, you're a disgrace
to the Union Army.

571
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:54,712
Drum him out, Queen's Own.

572
00:41:10,134 --> 00:41:14,230
- Do I have to drink the tea every time?
- Lf you want the fortune to come true.

573
00:41:16,574 --> 00:41:19,805
That's the fourth time today
I done read the tea leaves.

574
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:24,175
You keep drinking tea like that, and you's
going to turn as yellow as a canary.

575
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:28,679
Onions.

576
00:41:30,521 --> 00:41:35,925
One. Two. Three.

577
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,687
There. I made my wish.

578
00:41:38,863 --> 00:41:42,492
You going to get that wish all
wore out before it comes true.

579
00:41:42,766 --> 00:41:47,999
Here we is, you and me, asking our fortune
from the tea. Look in the cup and I'll see...

580
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,003
...what I see.

581
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:54,008
Now, now, what's this I see?

582
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:58,808
What's this?
Appears to be like a bird. Yes.

583
00:41:58,983 --> 00:42:02,282
Here's his wings spreading out.
He's flying this way.

584
00:42:02,453 --> 00:42:05,684
Oh, yes, Callie, I can see it's a bird,
but what does it mean?

585
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:08,450
- It's a message coming straight to you.
- From him?

586
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:11,857
Give me time, Miss Libby,
give me time.

587
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:15,958
What's that tall and straight
walking beside the bird?

588
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:18,761
- Oh, let me see.
- Don't touch it, Miss Libby.

589
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,336
You'll spoil the spell.

590
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,869
Why, I declare, it's a man.

591
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:28,501
Now, what's he doing? He's pulling on
something with his left hand.

592
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,671
- Now, what can that be?
- A horse. He's in the Cavalry.

593
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:36,252
No, it ain't a horse.
Ain't a gun. It's, it's...

594
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,546
- No, it ain't a sword, neither.
- Oh, Callie.

595
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,486
- I's got it, I's got it!
- What?

596
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,524
It's a doorbell.

597
00:42:48,699 --> 00:42:52,066
- Somebody's got to answer the door.
- And that somebody ain't me.

598
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:56,195
- That's magic, that bell.
- Oh, nonsense, Callie. It's all right.

599
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,603
Go on, Callie, answer it.

600
00:42:58,776 --> 00:43:03,509
- Go on. It's all right.
- Oh, feet, keep me from slipping down.

601
00:43:03,681 --> 00:43:05,808
Get my rabbit's foot.

602
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:11,413
<i>Brother rabbit</i>, <i>work your charm</i>
<i>Keep this child away from harm</i>

603
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:16,117
<i>Ain't got time to kneel and pray</i>
<i>Don't you let me down today</i>

604
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:27,260
Here he is, Miss Libby, here he is.

605
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:32,405
Just like the dead
riding up and saying howdy.

606
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:36,206
What's the matter, Miss Libby?

607
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:40,373
You got your wish, and you're standing
like your feet is glued in molasses.

608
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:41,779
Please, Callie.

609
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:46,719
- This gentleman, Mr...? Mr...?
- Why, Custer, ma'am.

610
00:43:46,890 --> 00:43:49,450
Mr. Custer hasn't stated
what he's here for.

611
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:53,319
I have a letter to your father
from General Sheridan.

612
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:56,295
- My father will be home soon.
- And an apology for you.

613
00:43:56,467 --> 00:43:58,731
- Isn't it a little late?
- A little late?

614
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:01,996
Three o'clock on a bright,
shiny afternoon?

615
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:04,037
Don't get uppity, Miss Libby.

616
00:44:04,208 --> 00:44:07,473
Because the tea leaves never forgets
and they never forgive.

617
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:11,479
If you'd care to wait for my father,
I'll show you into the drawing room.

618
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:21,051
But, Miss Bacon.
It was really you I came to see.

619
00:44:21,225 --> 00:44:23,989
- But why?
- Because, ma'am...

620
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,927
...I can't imagine anything worse
than walking through life without you.

621
00:44:28,098 --> 00:44:32,501
Don't propose you come strolling by at
9:00 and find me sitting on the porch again.

622
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,867
I'm sorry. Won't you forgive me?
It really wasn't my fault.

623
00:44:36,040 --> 00:44:39,032
I'm not really angry. I just thought
I should pretend to be.

624
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:41,769
I knew you when you didn't come back
you had good reason.

625
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:45,676
Yes. I had to report to Washington,
barely had time to catch the train.

626
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,909
And a train won't wait,
but a woman will.

627
00:44:49,086 --> 00:44:53,113
Thank you, ma'am.
I was hoping you'd say that, ma'am.

628
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:56,450
Tell me, have you always lived
in this big house?

629
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:59,425
- Yes. Why?
- Oh, nothing, except I remember it well.

630
00:44:59,596 --> 00:45:02,997
I'd ride by when I was a little fellow
on my way to go swimming.

631
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:06,227
There was a sassy brat
who used to hang on the gate...

632
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:09,736
...and stick her tongue out.
I pulled her pigtails for her once.

633
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:12,239
Was it you who pulled my pigtails?

634
00:45:12,409 --> 00:45:14,536
Was it you who owned them?

635
00:45:15,913 --> 00:45:17,608
- Oh, dear.
- What is it?

636
00:45:17,781 --> 00:45:20,944
I don't see how I can smell onions
from the kitchen but...

637
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:27,057
Onions? Onions? That's funny. I don't
smell them. Don't you like onions?

638
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:32,127
Oh, I love them. I just thought that
maybe you didn't like them.

639
00:45:32,296 --> 00:45:34,764
Oh, no. No, I'm very fond of them.

640
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:37,364
Callie, will you go
to the kitchen, please...

641
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:40,469
...and bring us back some of those
green spring onions?

642
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:45,969
- Onions?
- Yes, Callie, onions. You know I love them.

643
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:49,971
I knows what you love, honey.
It ain't onions.

644
00:45:53,984 --> 00:45:56,885
Pardon me.
I didn't mean to touch your hand.

645
00:46:00,557 --> 00:46:03,685
It's a pleasure to find somebody
who appreciates onions.

646
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:08,059
I was reading how Marshal Murat used to
demolish a whole plateful for breakfast.

647
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:11,201
Please, don't take that one.
Here's a better one for you.

648
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:13,859
See the fine, long grain in that one?

649
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:16,972
Good smell to it too. Try it.
That'll have a bite to it.

650
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,803
I said to the general,
"All I want is two things.

651
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:23,276
A week's leave and a letter
of introduction to your father."

652
00:46:23,947 --> 00:46:25,574
Now...

653
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:30,682
...when you see Father,
all you have to do is say to him:

654
00:46:30,854 --> 00:46:34,813
"May I return and call on Libby?"
No, you better say "Miss Bacon" first.

655
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:37,722
- Yes, that'd be better.
- Don't be afraid of him.

656
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:41,126
Afraid?
You're talking to a soldier, ma'am.

657
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:46,669
- Why, you's back early, Mr. Bacon.
- Yes, I am.

658
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,704
Oh, here comes Father now.

659
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:57,103
He's really a darling,
though he looks severe, so just speak up.

660
00:46:57,281 --> 00:46:59,010
I will, ma'am.

661
00:46:59,683 --> 00:47:02,743
- Father, dear, I'm so glad to see you.
- My dear.

662
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,514
- I want you to meet Lieutenant Custer.
- Custer?

663
00:47:05,689 --> 00:47:11,059
- Yes. He has a letter from Phil Sheridan.
- General Sheridan. This must be important.

664
00:47:33,116 --> 00:47:37,075
- How did this fellow get into my house?
- He has a letter from Uncle Phil.

665
00:47:37,254 --> 00:47:39,848
So I'm a fat little pipsqueak, am I?

666
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,924
- I'm a sanctimonious old skinflint, am I?
- But, Father...

667
00:47:43,093 --> 00:47:45,960
Hold your tongue. How dare you
come from that den of iniquity...

668
00:47:46,129 --> 00:47:48,825
...that haunt of debauchery,
to pollute my home?

669
00:47:48,999 --> 00:47:53,595
- Sorry, but if you'll allow me to explain...
- There's no explanation for your conduct.

670
00:47:53,770 --> 00:47:57,638
- None that's fit for her ears.
- Sir, I have a letter of introduction...

671
00:47:57,808 --> 00:48:00,868
...from General Sheridan...
- A letter from the president...

672
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,411
...would be equally offensive.
Get out of my house.

673
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:08,039
- Go on.
- I'll show him out, Mr. Bacon.

674
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,186
Right this way, and good riddance.

675
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:14,120
The idea of you aggravating
quality folks like them.

676
00:48:14,291 --> 00:48:18,125
Mr. Bacon done ordered you out,
and out you going right now, sir.

677
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:25,099
But not for good. You is coming back.
Nine o'clock at the gate.

678
00:48:26,837 --> 00:48:31,968
<i>Brother rabbit</i>, <i>work your charm</i>
<i>And keep that big boy out of harm</i>

679
00:48:42,152 --> 00:48:43,642
Libby.

680
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:49,190
It ain't unless you's colorblind.

681
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,987
Where is she? I thought you said...

682
00:48:52,729 --> 00:48:55,391
Her papa's home with
his special kicking-out boots.

683
00:48:55,565 --> 00:48:58,966
- Miss Libby's locked in her room. Come on.
- That ugly old fossil.

684
00:48:59,136 --> 00:49:00,626
He can't do that to her.

685
00:49:00,804 --> 00:49:04,934
That's what she said as he turned that lock.
They had a difference of opinion.

686
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:08,566
Now she's upstairs with her opinion,
and he's downstairs with his.

687
00:49:08,745 --> 00:49:10,770
- Can you climb?
- Up there? Sure.

688
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,746
Wait a minute. I don't want
to cause her more trouble.

689
00:49:13,917 --> 00:49:16,545
We better arrange a signal
in case he comes out.

690
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,779
- I can hoot like an owl.
- You can?

691
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:21,218
Oh, that's fine.

692
00:49:22,492 --> 00:49:25,154
- George.
- Libby.

693
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:51,045
Oh, George. Isn't it awful?

694
00:49:51,221 --> 00:49:54,987
It's worse than that. Just when I have
a chance to see you, I get orders.

695
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:58,150
- What orders? I meant Father.
- Well, I meant Uncle Sam.

696
00:49:58,328 --> 00:49:59,989
I've got to rejoin my regiment.

697
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,893
- Oh, no. When?
- Tonight.

698
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:08,237
You can't. You'll be killed.
I won't let you.

699
00:50:15,245 --> 00:50:18,146
- Who's out here?
- Just us owls, sir.

700
00:50:18,315 --> 00:50:21,250
- Who?
- Just me and an old owl, Mr. Bacon.

701
00:50:21,418 --> 00:50:26,219
- Have you seen anything of that scoundrel?
- I ain't seen hide nor hair of no scoundrel.

702
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:31,589
- Well, keep your eyes open.
- Yes, sir, that's just what I'm doing, sir.

703
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,889
- He's gone?
- I think so.

704
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:41,530
There's always the chance
he may come back again.

705
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,272
Oh, Libby.

706
00:50:48,445 --> 00:50:52,643
- Will you marry me?
- Yes, George.

707
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,389
- What did you say?
- What? I said, will you marry me?

708
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:02,423
- When I'm a general.
- Oh, lieutenant.

709
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:04,457
Oh, it's easy to become a general.

710
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:08,587
Then that old crab... I mean, that nice
old father of yours will be proud...

711
00:51:08,765 --> 00:51:12,599
...to have me in the family. He'll be at
the station with hat in hand.

712
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,828
Yes, general.

713
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,480
The old owl.

714
00:51:27,217 --> 00:51:30,448
Holy smoke!
It's your father. Goodbye.

715
00:51:51,975 --> 00:51:55,308
What did you have to wake up for,
you old devil?

716
00:51:59,683 --> 00:52:02,151
Don't you wink at me.

717
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,921
Take an order, corporal.

718
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:08,523
Commanding officer,
Sixteenth Ohio Infantry.

719
00:52:08,692 --> 00:52:11,718
You're required to report immediately
the percentage of...

720
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:17,128
...A, Methodists, B, Baptists, C,
other denominations among recruits.

721
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:21,794
Using form AGO 117
less Section 12 in compiling the return.

722
00:52:21,972 --> 00:52:24,372
By order, et cetera, et cetera,
and initial it.

723
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:26,966
From the colonel
of the 2nd Cavalry.

724
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:30,341
He refuses to send back your horse
until Custer's return.

725
00:52:30,514 --> 00:52:32,277
- That's tomorrow, sir.
- Does he?

726
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:36,647
Honor among horse thieves, I suppose.
Well, we'll see about that. Take an order.

727
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:40,881
Lieutenant George Armstrong Custer,
2nd Cavalry.

728
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:46,795
Taipe, Lee gave us the slip.
Don't know where he's heading.

729
00:52:46,963 --> 00:52:49,864
Put every cavalry unit in GHQ
in reserve on the remove.

730
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:53,093
- Get them going, Taipe.
- Yes, sir. Take an order, sergeant.

731
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:57,138
Form AGO 21.
No, use the new form AGO 201.

732
00:52:57,307 --> 00:53:00,435
It isn't issued. Get it from supply.
Take his desk, Smith.

733
00:53:00,610 --> 00:53:02,942
What's the Michigan Brigade
doing at Hanover?

734
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:06,344
Refitting. They lost their commander
and haven't a brigadier.

735
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:09,417
Appoint one. The senior man
listed as Cavalry colonel.

736
00:53:09,586 --> 00:53:12,020
- I don't know who he is, sir.
- Find out later.

737
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,419
- Dictate an order now.
- Yes, sir.

738
00:53:14,591 --> 00:53:16,388
Take this, corporal.

739
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:20,621
I've been instructed to inform you
you've been promoted to Brigadier General.

740
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:25,234
You'll proceed to Hanover and assume
command of the Michigan Cavalry Brigade.

741
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:28,735
General Scott, sir. News.
Lee has invaded Pennsylvania.

742
00:53:28,905 --> 00:53:33,069
- His patrols are near Gettysburg.
- Near Gettysburg!

743
00:53:33,243 --> 00:53:36,371
This means a reconcentration.
Come with me, gentlemen.

744
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:38,411
- Sign this order, sir?
- Come, Taipe.

745
00:53:38,582 --> 00:53:40,209
Yes, sir.

746
00:53:47,557 --> 00:53:52,119
Gettysburg.
Where the deuce is Gettysburg?

747
00:54:04,874 --> 00:54:07,001
This is your tent.
I'll unpack your kit.

748
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:09,509
The officers' mess
is at the end of the road.

749
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:13,672
Excuse me, lieutenant. I represent
George Straith Limited, military tailors.

750
00:54:13,850 --> 00:54:17,251
We serve General Grant,
General Sherman, General Scott.

751
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:20,548
- Any requirements? Greatcoat? Breeches?
- No, thanks.

752
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:23,921
We can cut a fine tunic
for a figure like yours, lieutenant.

753
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:28,258
There's any ideas that you have of your
own, we'd be glad to incorporate them.

754
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:31,127
- No, thanks.
- There's a shell jacket that's admired.

755
00:54:31,301 --> 00:54:34,270
- Particularly by the ladies.
- Shut up and leave me alone.

756
00:54:34,437 --> 00:54:37,201
You're out of sorts, but if
you'd give me a chance...

757
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:39,604
Shut up and get out!

758
00:54:41,144 --> 00:54:43,544
- Welcome back, general.
- Hello, general.

759
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:47,706
General? I'll have you know, gentlemen,
I'm in no mood for humor.

760
00:54:47,884 --> 00:54:49,476
Good afternoon, general.

761
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:55,918
- Orderly, I'd like a little coffee, please.
- Congratulations, general.

762
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:57,684
That's enough of this fooling.

763
00:54:57,861 --> 00:55:01,319
- Next man will find a limit to my patience.
- For General Custer.

764
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:07,901
- Sharp, I'll take this from anyone but you.
- Wait, we're not being funny.

765
00:55:08,071 --> 00:55:10,835
The Lord knows how or why,
but you are a general.

766
00:55:11,007 --> 00:55:12,474
- What do you mean?
- Orders.

767
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:17,204
Here's a letter from headquarters to
Brigadier General George Armstrong Custer.

768
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:21,372
- Is this someone's idea of a joke?
- There are no jokes in orders.

769
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:25,711
This makes less sense to me
than it does to you.

770
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:29,188
Must be a mistake. They don't
make generals out of shavetails.

771
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:32,385
I'd ask for verification if I were you.

772
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:35,053
Well, you don't happen to be me, Sharp.

773
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:39,224
If there are four regiments of cavalry
waiting for a general named Custer...

774
00:55:39,402 --> 00:55:41,529
...then they've got him.

775
00:55:43,273 --> 00:55:45,036
Hey.

776
00:55:45,709 --> 00:55:49,543
Hi. Hey, tailor.
Hey. Tailor, come here.

777
00:56:04,394 --> 00:56:06,885
Yesterday there was fighting
20 miles from here.

778
00:56:07,063 --> 00:56:11,329
Our army has been driven out of Gettysburg
and occupies a ridge below town.

779
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:15,699
The orders are to concentrate below this
hill marked Big Round Top on the map.

780
00:56:15,872 --> 00:56:18,363
Jeb Stuart's moving
to flank us from the south.

781
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:21,669
Undoubtedly. As senior colonel,
I'll assume command...

782
00:56:21,845 --> 00:56:24,780
...if this brigadier hasn't arrived
by the time we move.

783
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:27,974
Who this Custer is and why he's
not here, I don't know.

784
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:30,278
Turn out the guard.
Commanding officer.

785
00:56:30,453 --> 00:56:33,718
We'll get a chance to see
what he looks like now.

786
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,553
Judas priest, what's that?

787
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:44,962
He's got more gold braid on him
than a French admiral.

788
00:56:47,570 --> 00:56:51,131
Gentlemen, we might as well
reach an understanding at first sight.

789
00:56:51,307 --> 00:56:54,071
After seeing your columns
and your transports...

790
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:58,613
...I'm here to tell you that this brigade is
through with inefficiency as of today.

791
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:02,616
It's going to learn the meaning of
smartness and orders are to be obeyed.

792
00:57:02,786 --> 00:57:05,118
- Do I make myself clear?
- Yes, sir.

793
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:06,687
We're ready to move, sir.

794
00:57:06,856 --> 00:57:10,952
Brigade's ordered to concentrate on
Round Top, just south of Gettysburg.

795
00:57:11,127 --> 00:57:12,355
What's that?

796
00:57:12,529 --> 00:57:15,020
Probably enemy patrol
raiding the supply column.

797
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:18,133
Lee's in Gettysburg,
Stuart's cavalry's in the South.

798
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:22,328
Rejoin your units. Be prepared to move
in 10 minutes. Columns headed east.

799
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:23,938
- East?
- What?

800
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,541
- But the orders.
- To the devil with the orders.

801
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:28,609
We'll ride to the sound of the guns.

802
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:30,211
Things look better now.

803
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,838
With Cemetery back in our hands
and Sickles' front restored but...

804
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:35,882
Yesterday we lost 20,000 men.

805
00:57:36,052 --> 00:57:37,952
Pickett's reinforced Longstreet.

806
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,988
- Massing to attack our center.
- I'm not worried about that.

807
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:42,681
I'm worried about Jeb Stuart.

808
00:57:42,859 --> 00:57:45,191
Why hasn't he turned
the flank at Round Top?

809
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:47,852
He knows our cavalry's
concentrated to stop him.

810
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:53,196
When did our cavalry ever stop Jeb Stuart?
If he turns us, the position's lost.

811
00:57:53,369 --> 00:57:56,395
Washington and Baltimore will fall.

812
00:58:00,608 --> 00:58:02,200
Hanover?

813
00:58:02,577 --> 00:58:05,410
Stuart. Stuart's caught at Hanover.

814
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,008
It's a mistake.

815
00:58:07,315 --> 00:58:10,648
- Get verification at once.
- It has been verified, sir.

816
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:18,882
He's on our rear. We're trapped.

817
00:58:19,060 --> 00:58:21,824
All that stands between us
and total disaster...

818
00:58:21,996 --> 00:58:24,931
...is the Michigan Brigade.
Handful of volunteers.

819
00:58:25,100 --> 00:58:26,965
But they were ordered to Round Top.

820
00:58:27,135 --> 00:58:30,434
- It's on its way now.
- Then stop it, Taipe. Stop it.

821
00:58:30,605 --> 00:58:33,199
Tell it to hold its ground
to the last man.

822
00:58:33,374 --> 00:58:34,807
Who's the brigadier?

823
00:58:34,976 --> 00:58:37,410
- Why...
- Who is he, Taipe?

824
00:58:37,579 --> 00:58:39,046
Why...

825
00:58:41,149 --> 00:58:42,446
Corporal Smith.

826
00:58:43,084 --> 00:58:46,281
As you were. Who's the new commander
of the Michigan Cavalry?

827
00:58:46,454 --> 00:58:48,615
- General Custer, sir.
- General Custer.

828
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:51,757
- Custer? What Custer's that?
- George Armstrong Custer.

829
00:58:51,926 --> 00:58:54,053
Here's a copy of the order.

830
00:58:54,729 --> 00:58:57,789
- What is this? How did this happen?
- Well, who is he?

831
00:58:57,966 --> 00:58:59,263
Heaven help us, sir.

832
00:58:59,434 --> 00:59:02,403
The Michigan Brigade is led by
the most irresponsible...

833
00:59:02,570 --> 00:59:05,095
...rattle-brained second lieutenant
in the Army.

834
00:59:10,411 --> 00:59:13,039
Seventh Michigan, forward.

835
00:59:17,051 --> 00:59:18,678
Trot!

836
00:59:22,590 --> 00:59:23,818
Gallop!

837
00:59:25,226 --> 00:59:27,160
Charge!

838
00:59:51,419 --> 00:59:53,478
We'll take immediate action
with Custer.

839
00:59:53,655 --> 00:59:56,453
This Custer of yours is
insubordinate, all right.

840
00:59:56,658 --> 01:00:00,424
Thank God for it.
He's not marching on Round Top.

841
01:00:00,595 --> 01:00:04,656
- He's attacking Stuart at Hanover!
- Attacking? Attacking a whole corps?

842
01:00:04,833 --> 01:00:07,700
Rather than hold his ground,
the mad fool is attacking!

843
01:00:22,851 --> 01:00:26,150
That was a gallant charge,
men, even if it failed.

844
01:00:26,387 --> 01:00:30,289
Sergeant, see that the wounded
are taken care of.

845
01:00:31,626 --> 01:00:33,685
Senior colonel presents
his compliments.

846
01:00:33,862 --> 01:00:36,922
Fifth and 6th Michigan are
formed for attack. Any orders?

847
01:00:40,034 --> 01:00:42,502
Try more weight.
Fifth and 6th attack together.

848
01:00:42,670 --> 01:00:45,798
Very good. Where will the general's
headquarters be located?

849
01:00:45,974 --> 01:00:49,068
Headquarters? In front
of the attacking regiment.

850
01:00:56,985 --> 01:00:59,613
Fifth and 6th Michigan, forward!

851
01:01:06,961 --> 01:01:08,656
Trot!

852
01:01:10,999 --> 01:01:12,933
Gallop!

853
01:01:14,402 --> 01:01:16,097
Charge!

854
01:01:40,428 --> 01:01:43,625
The order in question, being
erroneous, is hereby revoked...

855
01:01:43,865 --> 01:01:46,425
...and as of today, revert
to second lieutenant.

856
01:01:46,601 --> 01:01:48,262
Never mind that, Taipe.

857
01:01:48,436 --> 01:01:51,837
"Consecutive attacks by 7th, 6th,
5th Michigan Cavalry...

858
01:01:52,006 --> 01:01:54,201
...are repulsed by losses near Hanover.

859
01:01:54,375 --> 01:01:58,573
- Enemy advance continues."
- Three regiments ruined by a fool.

860
01:01:58,746 --> 01:02:00,509
Three out of our last four.

861
01:02:09,557 --> 01:02:11,081
Ride, you Wolverines!

862
01:02:11,259 --> 01:02:13,750
First Michigan, charge!

863
01:02:52,633 --> 01:02:55,966
What is it? What is it?
Read it to me, man.

864
01:02:56,137 --> 01:02:59,664
"Stuart retiring in disorder after assault
by Michigan Cavalry...

865
01:02:59,841 --> 01:03:02,139
...enemy abandoning guns."

866
01:03:06,948 --> 01:03:08,575
And now, gentlemen...

867
01:03:08,783 --> 01:03:11,980
...If Meade can hold the ridge
at Gettysburg...

868
01:03:12,253 --> 01:03:15,154
...by God's grace,
the Union will be safe.

869
01:03:16,457 --> 01:03:17,754
General...

870
01:03:17,925 --> 01:03:19,654
...about this Custer matter...

871
01:03:19,827 --> 01:03:24,093
...what do you propose to do?
- Do? Do, Taipe?

872
01:03:25,466 --> 01:03:27,491
Oh, yes, Custer.

873
01:03:27,668 --> 01:03:30,262
I intend to walk across the street...

874
01:03:30,438 --> 01:03:34,772
...and buy myself a double portion
of creamed Bermuda onions.
