1
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:28,991
OFFICIAL ENTRY
1969 FESTIVAL OF THE ARTS

2
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:33,462
DAIEI STUDIOS

3
00:00:40,907 --> 00:00:47,210
FIRES ON THE PLAIN

4
00:00:52,685 --> 00:00:53,709
You idiot!

5
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,354
The hospital sends you back
and you obey?

6
00:00:56,556 --> 00:00:59,855
There's no room here
for consumptives like you!

7
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:03,223
Go back!
Tell 'em you have nowhere to go.

8
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,091
They'll have to take you.

9
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:09,493
Why can't you
grasp the situation?

10
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:13,498
We landed to the west
under enemy fire

11
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:16,368
to reinforce units
at Tacloban.

12
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,909
We lost two-thirds of our men.

13
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,340
Our artillery was sunk in transit.

14
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:28,010
We tried to reach Burauen airfield

15
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,246
by crossing
the central mountains,

16
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:32,948
but without artillery,
it was impossible.

17
00:01:33,726 --> 00:01:35,990
The enemy's counterattack

18
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:38,494
forced all companies
to fan out across the valley.

19
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:40,832
You know all that.

20
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:44,003
We brought 12 days' rations
from Ormoc.

21
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:46,900
You really think there's any left?

22
00:01:47,107 --> 00:01:51,237
Soldiers are taking turns
foraging for food.

23
00:01:51,878 --> 00:01:56,542
You're coughing up blood
and can't even lift a sack of potatoes.

24
00:01:56,749 --> 00:01:58,410
In the thick of war,

25
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:01,246
your comrades gave you
five days' food to take to the hospital.

26
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:04,713
Three days later you returned,

27
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:07,950
saying they'd
pronounced you cured.

28
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,120
TB cured in three days?

29
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,858
With five days' food,
you should've stayed that long.

30
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:19,370
I sent you back to complain,
but the doctor claimed

31
00:02:19,572 --> 00:02:23,269
it wasn't five days' worth,
and it was all gone anyway?

32
00:02:23,476 --> 00:02:25,205
What kind of imbecile are you?

33
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:30,379
I don't begrudge you the food.

34
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:36,020
If you could work like the others,
then no problem.

35
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:41,120
This company's shrunk
to the size of a platoon.

36
00:02:41,327 --> 00:02:43,454
But we still have to eat!

37
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,288
The unit has split into three groups

38
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,593
taking turns foraging
for yams and bananas.

39
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:54,364
They eat what they find
and bring some back for the others.

40
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:58,408
Then the next group goes.
Like goddamn beggars!

41
00:02:59,078 --> 00:03:01,103
This is the Imperial Army!

42
00:03:01,314 --> 00:03:03,805
It's a disgrace,
but what can I do?

43
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:06,315
We all have to pitch in.

44
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,387
You're nothing but a burden.
You should be ashamed!

45
00:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,157
All I can do
as your squad leader

46
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,456
is send you back to the hospital
before everyone starts hating you.

47
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:23,494
If they don't admit you,
sit there until they do.

48
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,638
If they still refuse,
then you must die!

49
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:30,371
You weren't given
a hand grenade for nothing.

50
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:33,478
If they send you away,
blow yourself up.

51
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:36,308
That will be your final duty.

52
00:03:39,652 --> 00:03:43,315
I, Private First Class Tamura,
will return to the hospital.

53
00:03:43,523 --> 00:03:46,253
If they do not admit me,
I will kill myself.

54
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:49,121
Good!
Now buck up and go!

55
00:04:03,376 --> 00:04:05,936
Don't bother reporting
to the commander.

56
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:33,666
I, PFC Tamura, will report
to the hospital as ordered.

57
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:40,843
Fall in!

58
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,679
It's not easy for the squad leader.

59
00:04:43,883 --> 00:04:47,319
He can only order the men
to dig air-raid shelters.

60
00:04:47,687 --> 00:04:50,815
They don't even have shovels.

61
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:54,821
Just sticks
and old worn-out pans.

62
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:58,589
I fill out
supply requisitions

63
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,891
with nowhere to send them.

64
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:05,230
The enemy doesn't even
bother with us anymore,

65
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,236
yet we still dig air-raid shelters.

66
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:11,501
You're better off at the hospital.

67
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:14,976
The company CO can't help you.

68
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:19,345
I'm sure he heard
the squad leader's hollering.

69
00:05:37,603 --> 00:05:39,628
Here are some rations.

70
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:43,966
I'm grateful.

71
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:00,319
Kill yourself only if you have to.

72
00:06:36,362 --> 00:06:39,263
Damn it, I'm starving.

73
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:20,135
Hey!

74
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:25,401
Where are you going?

75
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,875
I didn't think
anybody was around.

76
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:34,246
This is the entrance
to our camp.

77
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,686
Where there's an entrance,
there have to be sentries.

78
00:07:39,559 --> 00:07:42,084
It's so hot
we went in the shade.

79
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:44,058
Where are you going?

80
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,158
I, PFC Tamura,
am reporting to the hospital.

81
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:49,391
The hospital again?

82
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,866
I won't be returning
to the company.

83
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:53,736
Why not?

84
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:58,508
It seems there's no room here
for sick men like me.

85
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,914
Who said that?

86
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,014
The CO?

87
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:06,447
The squad leader?

88
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:13,751
Who knows who's better off anyway,
you or us?

89
00:08:15,194 --> 00:08:17,424
They'll order us to attack soon.

90
00:08:18,531 --> 00:08:20,465
But will the hospital take you?

91
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,536
I'll stick it out until they do.

92
00:08:24,937 --> 00:08:26,837
Don't give up.

107
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,677
Good day, sir.

108
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:25,553
Good... day.

109
00:15:27,192 --> 00:15:31,561
This way.
Please come in.

110
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:39,268
This way, sir.

111
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:52,512
Please eat.

112
00:15:55,554 --> 00:15:56,714
What's this?

113
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,753
That's salt, sir.

114
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,357
Is this your house?

115
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:05,189
No, sir. My house is
on the other side of the river.

116
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,930
Please eat.

117
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:29,214
What's that?

118
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,720
Yams for my parents
and siblings

119
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:34,790
out working in the jungle.

120
00:16:50,142 --> 00:16:52,133
Would you like some yams?

121
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:56,036
You mean those?

122
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:59,843
No, these aren't for you.
But wait a moment,

123
00:17:00,052 --> 00:17:02,486
and I'll get some nearby.

124
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,978
God, it stinks!

125
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,827
That bastard!

126
00:19:30,302 --> 00:19:31,769
The hospital!

127
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,671
I'm saved.

128
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,672
You idiot!

129
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,545
They throw you back here
like a baseball.

130
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,512
Go back and tell your leaders:

131
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,747
This hospital's overflowing
with seriously wounded men.

132
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:52,151
There are only two doctors
and seven medics.

133
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:56,350
I don't care if you're coughing blood.
If you can walk, you're not a patient.

134
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:57,961
Tell 'em that!

135
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:02,066
What kind of degenerate
comes in for something so minor?

136
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:08,967
But you've come a long way,
so if you've brought food,

137
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:11,233
you can rest here
for a few days.

138
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,642
I have no rations, sir.
Sir, no excuse, sir.

139
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:06,828
Those are 26cm guns.

140
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:10,126
Ormoc's getting hit
with long-range shells again.

141
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:16,771
You back again?

142
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:23,510
Looks like
another new man arrived.

143
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,117
He wasn't here this morning.

144
00:21:26,385 --> 00:21:30,845
There are three new guys,
including you.

145
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:33,989
Only one went away.

146
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:38,260
Pops, that one had crazy diarrhea.

147
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:42,729
He left 'cause guys
with diarrhea don't get fed.

148
00:21:42,934 --> 00:21:46,028
Shape he's in, he'll be dead
'fore he even walks a mile.

149
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,039
No point staying here.

150
00:21:49,241 --> 00:21:51,641
You can say that again, pops.

151
00:22:10,729 --> 00:22:12,924
They've still got rice.

152
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:16,794
We might as well eat too.

153
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:24,637
Gimme your yam.
I'll steam it with mine.

154
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:32,116
No appetite?

155
00:22:33,452 --> 00:22:36,182
Or out of yams?

156
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:41,253
You've got malaria.
You can't even move.

157
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,396
They really should admit you.

158
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,835
Wily bastard.

159
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:02,144
Everything's falling apart,
and the fucker's steaming yams.

160
00:23:02,848 --> 00:23:07,046
He got lots of tobacco from somewhere.
Wraps it around his belly.

161
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:12,780
He traded some for yams
at the hospital earlier.

162
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:16,324
He could return to his unit
but stays to do business here.

163
00:23:16,828 --> 00:23:19,626
He helps us out.
You jealous?

164
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:22,891
You think
if you side with him,

165
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:26,002
he'll give you half his yams?

166
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:29,070
He's a tightwad.
Won't even give you one.

167
00:23:29,274 --> 00:23:30,468
I have my own.

168
00:23:30,675 --> 00:23:32,802
You've got it good.

169
00:23:33,011 --> 00:23:35,309
I've only got one left.

170
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:47,157
Don't worry.
I won't ask you for yours.

171
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:54,658
We've been chucked out of our units.
No point fighting now.

172
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:59,226
I hope the Yanks
take us all prisoner.

173
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,235
They'd kill us.

174
00:24:01,907 --> 00:24:05,707
Nah, they think being a POW
is honorable.

175
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,907
They'll say,
"You guys fought hard,"

176
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,675
then fill us up
with corned beef.

177
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:46,583
Thanks.

178
00:24:52,457 --> 00:24:55,119
Go ask your buddy for some.

179
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,492
Didn't you say
you had some yams?

180
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:24,314
I won't forget your kindness
as long as I live.

181
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,320
That won't be long.

182
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,015
That's for sure.

183
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:32,856
I'll swipe some hospital food tonight
and pay you back in the morning.

184
00:25:33,064 --> 00:25:35,464
Don't.
You'll get caught.

185
00:25:35,667 --> 00:25:37,498
Don't you feel sorry
for the patients?

186
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,577
What's wrong?

187
00:26:00,792 --> 00:26:02,657
Looks like
he pissed himself.

188
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:06,991
Tell us when you gotta pee.
We'll hold you up.

189
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:13,461
It's hopeless.
He won't last long.

190
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:20,205
You're all deserters!

191
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:27,851
A career soldier,
as gung ho as ever.

192
00:26:42,367 --> 00:26:44,460
- Fucking bastard!
- What's going on?

193
00:26:44,669 --> 00:26:46,193
Stealing yams!

194
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:48,269
Where's the candle?

195
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,407
Hold him down!

196
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:00,379
Son of a bitch!

197
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:03,343
- Is he a patient?
- No, one of the squatters.

198
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:05,852
Drop dead, you worthless shit!

199
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:08,787
We're gonna chase
you all off tomorrow!

200
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:39,122
Aren't they shelling
your company?

201
00:27:39,391 --> 00:27:41,291
Looks like it.

202
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:46,086
We may be in danger here too.

203
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:49,490
What's that smoke?

204
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:51,862
Beats me.

205
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:56,138
I saw lots of smoke
on my way here yesterday.

206
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:59,606
Black smoke
everywhere I went.

207
00:28:00,311 --> 00:28:02,404
This morning it's over there.

208
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:05,214
Pops, you think
it's some kinda signal?

209
00:28:05,417 --> 00:28:07,544
Smoke signals?

210
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,812
The Yanks wouldn't use
anything so primitive.

211
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:13,149
Maybe it's guerrillas.

212
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:38,141
Hey, get moving
or you'll be killed!

213
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,348
He's dead.

214
00:29:12,550 --> 00:29:14,643
They took
almost everything!

215
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:45,137
I was told to die,

216
00:30:45,944 --> 00:30:48,174
and I intend to.

217
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:52,575
So why run?

218
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,581
There was no need
to fill my canteen.

219
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:39,487
Some of you may still be alive.

220
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:44,427
But I won't come to your aid.

221
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,761
I'll be dead soon myself.

222
00:31:48,072 --> 00:31:50,302
Then we'll be even.

223
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:10,159
MANY DAYS PASSED...

224
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:14,597
AND MANY NIGHTS

225
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:19,752
What's that?

226
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:32,192
A village.

227
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:35,634
That must be the cross
on the church.

228
00:34:37,341 --> 00:34:42,369
I'll be killed if I'm caught.
So why do I want to go there?

229
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,226
Is that the cross I saw?

230
00:38:10,821 --> 00:38:11,981
Japanese soldiers!

231
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,513
Hello.

232
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,830
Don't!

233
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,140
Don't kill me!

234
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,450
Salt!

235
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,198
Japanese soldiers!

236
00:43:43,854 --> 00:43:45,947
What unit are you from?

237
00:43:47,992 --> 00:43:52,292
PFC Tamura,
Murayama Company, Koizumi Corps.

238
00:43:52,496 --> 00:43:55,090
Murayama Company
was wiped out at Albuera.

239
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:59,599
I was in the hospital.
I came here alone.

240
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,367
Where's your rifle?

241
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:07,907
I lost it in a valley.

242
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,745
Some soldier you are.

243
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:12,415
Your company, sir?

244
00:44:12,616 --> 00:44:16,746
Oshima Company.
We got cut to pieces at Burauen.

245
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:23,025
We were to join a paratrooper unit,
but only 30 of them landed alive.

246
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:26,620
They ran our direction
in the jungle

247
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:29,094
and got our company
blown apart in the bargain.

248
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:32,898
We sure were relieved
to find this yam field yesterday.

249
00:44:33,137 --> 00:44:34,764
Yams?

250
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:36,671
Are there any left?

251
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:39,741
Stop slobbering.
There's lots left.

252
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:48,745
But you better hurry.
A plane was patrolling here earlier.

253
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:54,388
Let's clear out.

254
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:57,059
It was a gift from the gods
to find so many.

255
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,593
They'll tide us over
until Palompon.

256
00:45:00,731 --> 00:45:04,064
Sir, are you proceeding
to Palompon?

257
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:10,402
All troops on Leyte
are ordered to assemble there.

258
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:13,599
All units are retreating
for evacuation to Cebu.

259
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,005
I didn't know.

260
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:16,611
You going too?

261
00:45:16,814 --> 00:45:18,645
Yes, if you would be so kind.

262
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:21,909
I haven't heard
such fancy talk in ages.

263
00:45:23,687 --> 00:45:26,622
We never offered
to take you along.

264
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:29,288
You look sick.
Can you keep up?

265
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,393
I'll do my utmost, sir.

266
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:37,265
We've been to hell and back.
Even ate human flesh in New Guinea.

267
00:45:37,868 --> 00:45:40,928
Come along,
but careful you don't get eaten!

268
00:45:48,746 --> 00:45:50,543
What have you got there?

269
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,240
It's nearly bursting.

270
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:54,917
It's salt.

271
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:56,552
Salt!

272
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,558
Talk about luxury!

273
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:06,657
What do you say?
Share some with us?

274
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:09,326
We'll take you along.

275
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:11,467
We won't eat you.
I was kidding.

276
00:46:11,668 --> 00:46:13,636
Yes, I'd be happy to share.

277
00:46:13,837 --> 00:46:16,397
Thanks!
How about a little taste now?

278
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:21,544
God, that's good!

279
00:46:28,418 --> 00:46:30,750
Let's go split it up
in the shade.

280
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:35,285
There's a hut over there.

281
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:47,596
- Ashes from a signal fire!
- Signal fire?

282
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,636
Guerrillas use them
as smoke signals.

283
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:52,308
I saw black smoke
everywhere.

284
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:53,908
So did we.

285
00:46:56,647 --> 00:47:00,981
What guerrillas?
Don't get all worked up.

286
00:47:01,585 --> 00:47:06,352
It's just farmers
burning corn husks.

287
00:47:06,557 --> 00:47:09,856
Looks like they just
harvested this field.

288
00:47:10,661 --> 00:47:14,097
Back home my family burns
piles of rice hulls.

289
00:47:15,299 --> 00:47:18,530
What's all the fuss?
They're just fires on the plain.

290
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,434
Where'd you get it?

291
00:47:57,207 --> 00:47:59,698
Down in a village.

292
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,568
A village?

293
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:05,403
It's pretty far away,
by the sea.

294
00:48:05,616 --> 00:48:07,675
You went there alone?

295
00:48:08,852 --> 00:48:11,218
That was brave.
Wasn't it dangerous?

296
00:48:11,955 --> 00:48:13,889
It was deserted.

297
00:48:14,091 --> 00:48:18,118
Looked like
the Americans had been there.

298
00:48:18,328 --> 00:48:21,764
Seems wandering Japanese soldiers
had also attacked a few times.

299
00:48:22,566 --> 00:48:25,865
The villagers had fled.

300
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:31,004
There was a pile of Japanese soldiers
killed by the villagers.

301
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,977
Anything else?

302
00:48:35,345 --> 00:48:37,176
- Such as?
- Food, of course.

303
00:48:37,381 --> 00:48:40,873
- Just salt.
- That can't be all. You look everywhere?

304
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:42,551
Just in one house.

305
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:44,448
I'll bet there's more food.

306
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:47,413
Why don't we take a look
on the way?

307
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:52,021
A man ran away.
Guerrillas may be there now.

308
00:48:52,229 --> 00:48:53,719
What?

309
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:55,762
Something sounds fishy.

310
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:59,133
You just said it was deserted.

311
00:48:59,670 --> 00:49:04,039
Two villagers returned for salt.
That's how I found it.

312
00:49:04,241 --> 00:49:06,004
So one ran away.
And the other?

313
00:49:06,209 --> 00:49:07,642
I don't know.

314
00:49:07,844 --> 00:49:09,744
Only one saw me,
and he ran away.

315
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:17,219
Well, you gave us salt,
so we'll take your word for it.

316
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,155
No time to dawdle.

317
00:49:19,356 --> 00:49:21,517
Get your yams.
We'll wait here.

318
00:49:21,725 --> 00:49:28,722
Sir, there's a hut and a field here.
Maybe even chickens.

319
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:30,763
Isn't it safer to stay here?

320
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:33,232
Wanna spend your life here?
Be my guest.

321
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,905
But you never know
when the Yanks might come.

322
00:49:36,106 --> 00:49:38,165
I'm not gonna take that risk.

323
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:23,235
I got you one.

324
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:28,378
Is this really
off a dead soldier?

325
00:51:28,852 --> 00:51:30,945
Where else?

326
00:51:31,154 --> 00:51:35,250
I too looked far and wide,

327
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:40,954
but inexplicably I couldn't find
a single dead soldier with a gun.

328
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,029
You don't know how to look.

329
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:46,669
So I got one for you.
Take it or leave it.

330
00:51:47,704 --> 00:51:50,571
Just shut up and take it.

331
00:51:52,509 --> 00:51:55,342
Thank you very much, sir.

332
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:05,177
Any troops here
from Shimizu Company?

333
00:52:12,362 --> 00:52:15,798
Get a load of him.
Not a care in the world.

334
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,626
What do you mean?

335
00:52:17,834 --> 00:52:19,927
Resting against a tree trunk,

336
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:25,040
his things in a neat row,
hands clasped on his chest.

337
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,368
Just waiting to die.

338
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:32,641
Take a look.
His tidiness is admirable.

339
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:35,550
No, I won't look!
I refuse!

340
00:52:48,798 --> 00:52:52,290
Need tobacco?
One leaf for three yams.

341
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:53,995
Okay, two.

342
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:57,468
Sell it to the officers.
The division staff is behind us.

343
00:52:57,674 --> 00:52:59,232
Is that true?

344
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,307
Is it true or false?

345
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:05,003
Can't know until they come,
can you, dumbass?

346
00:53:13,623 --> 00:53:16,683
Hey, Tamura, you still alive?

347
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:21,026
You too?
Your beriberi got cured?

348
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:23,825
- Yeah, but I'm being bled dry.
- How so?

349
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:27,026
- By that awful bastard.
- What awful bastard?

350
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:31,571
Yasuda. He and I banded together,
so I'm selling his tobacco.

351
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:34,300
But the son of a bitch
can't move at all.

352
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:37,602
Which one is Yasuda?

353
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,622
Tamura, is it?
You look better.

354
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,856
I'll bet you have
a lot of food on you.

355
00:53:58,835 --> 00:54:02,532
Must be tough
getting around with that leg.

356
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:09,168
I can walk a little
if I lean on Nagamatsu.

357
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:12,479
And I can't eat
unless I let him.

358
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:17,977
That's right. We gotta reach
Palompon before my tobacco runs out.

359
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:20,716
Who would buy tobacco now?

360
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:25,190
Are you kidding?
Men can't live without tobacco.

361
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:28,159
The worse things get,
the more they need it.

362
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:29,957
We're selling a lot.

363
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:33,624
- That's not true, pops.
- You're just a bad salesman!

364
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:36,965
Soldiers would trade
their last yam for it.

365
00:54:37,841 --> 00:54:40,332
Look, the officers!
Hurry up and catch 'em!

366
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:51,981
I'll trade you that for a yam.

367
00:54:53,256 --> 00:54:56,521
Fool! Wasting your time
trading tobacco!

368
00:54:56,726 --> 00:54:59,194
Hurry up and get
to Palompon, you idiot!

369
00:55:03,166 --> 00:55:07,899
Get the food before you hand it over!
How many times I gotta tell you?

370
00:55:08,104 --> 00:55:10,129
That's the first time
that happened.

371
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,309
It'll happen again.
Be more careful, you ass!

372
00:55:13,943 --> 00:55:15,968
I'll be going now.

373
00:55:39,235 --> 00:55:41,032
I can't take it anymore.

374
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:44,497
Leave him then.

375
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:49,372
I'd starve if I did.

376
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:51,513
I can't even steal his tobacco.

377
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:56,414
He keeps it wrapped around his waist.
Only gives me a leaf at a time.

378
00:55:56,920 --> 00:55:58,785
It's true.

379
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,218
You'd best get to Palompon
as soon as possible.

380
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:03,551
Yasuda's not going.

381
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,251
He plans to surrender
to the Yanks.

382
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,557
You plan to surrender too?

383
00:56:14,871 --> 00:56:17,101
I'll cross that bridge later.

384
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:20,071
I'll just do
whatever Yasuda does.

385
00:56:47,370 --> 00:56:50,862
Is that how we'll end up?

386
00:56:54,944 --> 00:56:56,411
What's that?

387
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:28,624
Just look!
No shortages for them, I'll bet!

388
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,799
All fat as pigs!

389
00:59:31,334 --> 00:59:34,132
First time I've actually
seen the enemy.

390
00:59:34,337 --> 00:59:37,431
We've heard 'em
but never seen 'em.

391
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:40,438
We never saw
who was shooting at us.

392
00:59:40,643 --> 00:59:46,172
Running left and right,
dodging their shells -

393
00:59:46,382 --> 00:59:48,213
it all seems a little funny now.

394
00:59:49,052 --> 00:59:53,011
See that house
beyond the main road?

395
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:55,782
The road forks there.

396
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:58,722
The road to Palompon

397
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:03,388
runs through the forest
at the foot of the hill.

398
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:08,131
We gotta get to that forest.

399
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:14,369
But that means crossing the road
and the open field.

400
01:00:19,415 --> 01:00:21,906
Hey, you, stay down!

401
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:32,659
We'll all be better off
once we're in Palompon.

402
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:37,128
They'll let us watch
the officers cross over to Cebu.

403
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:40,864
Is that you,
squad leader, sir?

404
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:43,368
Hey, not so loud!

405
01:00:52,982 --> 01:00:55,007
You still around?

406
01:00:57,353 --> 01:01:01,949
Yes, I ran into some comrades.
I apologize for my long absence.

407
01:01:02,892 --> 01:01:04,723
No apology needed.

408
01:01:04,927 --> 01:01:10,729
I almost gave up hope
of ever meeting up with you again.

409
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:15,799
It'll be tough crossing that road.

410
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:18,371
How you gonna do it
with no shoes?

411
01:01:18,574 --> 01:01:19,802
I'll be all right.

412
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:22,978
Will we be crossing at night, sir?

413
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:26,010
Ain't it obvious?

414
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:30,348
That marsh is pretty deep.

415
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:38,017
How deep you think it is?

416
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:40,218
Can't tell from up here.

417
01:01:40,430 --> 01:01:45,732
Is it the best place to cross? Well,
everyone's here, so I guess it must be.

418
01:01:46,936 --> 01:01:50,463
It's knee-deep on this side,
but shallower on the other.

419
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:54,835
You seem to know a lot.
You crossed it already?

420
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:58,138
Don't believe me
if you don't want to!

421
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:03,911
He's nuts,
getting mad over nothing.

422
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,678
Come here a minute.

423
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:14,759
You got any salt left?

424
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:18,633
Yes.

425
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:22,137
The squad leader ate mine.

426
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:25,797
Could you give me
a little more?

427
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,395
Thanks.

428
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:54,359
Let me give you some advice.

429
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:59,735
You've been following
the squad leader like a lost puppy,

430
01:02:59,942 --> 01:03:02,137
but I wouldn't, if I were you.

431
01:03:02,578 --> 01:03:08,278
He's treated us like dirt
since we landed in New Guinea.

432
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:13,521
We stay 'cause he's seen combat
and stays cool under fire.

433
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:17,952
He'll let you tag along
until he's taken all your salt.

434
01:03:18,161 --> 01:03:20,561
Then he'll toss you on your ass.

435
01:03:20,763 --> 01:03:24,665
Did you really eat human flesh
in New Guinea?

436
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:27,802
Better just think
of that as a joke.

437
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:31,997
I'm his subordinate so I'm stuck,
but you're free.

438
01:03:32,542 --> 01:03:37,878
I know it's scary on your own,
but you'd be better off.

439
01:03:38,080 --> 01:03:39,707
I understand.

440
01:03:39,916 --> 01:03:42,714
All right, then.
No more tagging along.

441
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:54,921
What were you guys
whispering about?

442
01:03:55,131 --> 01:03:59,192
Thinking about surrendering?
Now's your chance.

443
01:03:59,402 --> 01:04:04,772
Once we reach Palompon,
we may not see any Yanks.

444
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:09,375
Look, there's a friendly-Iookin' one.

445
01:04:18,421 --> 01:04:20,286
A chaplain.

446
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,954
It says "traveling chaplain."

447
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:25,593
Is that right?

448
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:28,527
You know English?

449
01:04:30,433 --> 01:04:33,664
No wonder he looks kind,
if he's a chaplain.

450
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:35,631
Hey, assholes!

451
01:04:39,809 --> 01:04:43,506
Just try and surrender!
I won't let you!

452
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:45,407
You should be ashamed!

453
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:47,776
Lag behind and I'll know
what you're up to.

454
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:50,578
You're going to Palompon,
like it or not!

455
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:54,647
Just look at your faces!

456
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:59,117
The enbankment!
We're safe! What a relief.

457
01:05:59,322 --> 01:06:01,620
Asshole!
Let go of my scabbard!

458
01:06:01,824 --> 01:06:03,257
Keep quiet!

459
01:06:04,293 --> 01:06:05,920
Don't get so close!

460
01:06:39,495 --> 01:06:40,928
Tanks!

461
01:06:43,165 --> 01:06:44,632
Tanks!

462
01:07:29,779 --> 01:07:31,804
I'm hit!

463
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:50,724
I think I left my gun over there.

464
01:09:23,592 --> 01:09:26,527
I don't think
I can make it to the forest.

465
01:09:31,667 --> 01:09:36,331
I don't think
I can make it to the forest.

466
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:31,423
He's alive.

467
01:10:32,728 --> 01:10:34,355
He's smoking.

468
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,348
I surrender!

469
01:12:06,855 --> 01:12:09,323
I surrender!

470
01:13:44,887 --> 01:13:47,515
Is Palompon this way?

471
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:52,217
Yes, but there are Yanks on the way.
We can't get past.

472
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,868
It's been raining forever.

473
01:14:22,691 --> 01:14:24,716
Hey, are you dead?

474
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:23,618
The earth's revolving, you see.

475
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:28,614
That's why the sun sinks,
sonny boy.

476
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:08,828
Brother,
where did you come from?

477
01:16:11,066 --> 01:16:13,534
The Pure Land in the West.

478
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:16,698
Buddha is Amida...

479
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:20,098
one is one...

480
01:16:20,742 --> 01:16:22,767
two is two.

481
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:27,308
I clasp my hands in prayer.

482
01:16:28,317 --> 01:16:30,945
Hey, let's get out of here.

483
01:16:33,855 --> 01:16:35,789
No need.

484
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:38,619
A plane is coming for me
from Taiwan.

485
01:16:38,827 --> 01:16:40,988
An autogiro.

486
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:45,059
It's supposed to land here.

487
01:16:50,739 --> 01:16:55,403
Mr. Airplane, come for me!
Please take me home!

488
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:58,672
I'm a Buddha!

489
01:16:59,781 --> 01:17:04,081
Save us, O merciful Buddha.

490
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:08,186
It hurts!

491
01:17:27,876 --> 01:17:29,673
What kind of birds are those?

492
01:17:30,779 --> 01:17:33,213
They're not birds.

493
01:17:34,082 --> 01:17:35,743
They're flies.

494
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:38,615
The flies are buzzing.

495
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:41,254
You're kinda stupid, aren't you?

496
01:18:07,749 --> 01:18:12,277
What, you still here?

497
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:14,952
Poor guy.

498
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:18,350
When I'm dead...

499
01:18:19,561 --> 01:18:22,655
you can eat this.

500
01:18:41,149 --> 01:18:43,117
Come back!

501
01:18:44,786 --> 01:18:47,254
You can eat me!

502
01:19:20,088 --> 01:19:22,283
I wouldn't do it.

503
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:24,584
I didn't do it.

504
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:29,388
I'm dreaming again.

505
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,730
Someone's watching me.

506
01:20:16,578 --> 01:20:18,239
Tamura, is that you?

507
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:21,181
Nagamatsu?

508
01:20:31,426 --> 01:20:33,587
Come on now.
It's water.

509
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:14,131
I can't chew.

510
01:21:16,771 --> 01:21:20,730
My teeth fell out.
My gums have gone soft.

511
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:31,483
- What's that?
- Monkey meat.

512
01:21:31,686 --> 01:21:34,246
- Monkey?
- Shot him in the forest.

513
01:21:37,692 --> 01:21:39,660
- I saw a hand.
- A hand?

514
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:42,019
What hand?

515
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:45,589
It's rolling around out there.
Didn't you know?

516
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:48,166
- Nope.
- Over there.

517
01:21:48,370 --> 01:21:52,500
All right, I get it.
Some soldier got his hand shot off.

518
01:21:54,809 --> 01:21:56,709
What happened to your buddy?

519
01:21:56,912 --> 01:21:58,504
Yasuda? Alive and kicking.

520
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:04,178
You guys been here all along?

521
01:22:04,686 --> 01:22:08,520
Yup. We couldn't make it
to the Ormoc highway.

522
01:22:08,723 --> 01:22:10,554
Wouldn't have
gotten past anyway.

523
01:22:10,759 --> 01:22:13,023
Yasuda's leg
keeps getting worse.

524
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:18,165
Says he can see
to the kneecap.

525
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:21,127
He won't show me though.

526
01:22:21,336 --> 01:22:23,861
It's noble of you
to look after him.

527
01:22:24,272 --> 01:22:25,705
Me?

528
01:22:26,174 --> 01:22:29,234
We're from the same outfit,
and it's Ionely on my own.

529
01:22:29,444 --> 01:22:31,810
And he's got tobacco.

530
01:22:32,614 --> 01:22:33,945
Still?

531
01:22:34,149 --> 01:22:36,583
He traded me some
for the monkey meat.

532
01:22:37,052 --> 01:22:40,078
Crafty bastard
never smokes any himself.

533
01:22:40,722 --> 01:22:42,713
Can you get up?

534
01:22:42,924 --> 01:22:44,391
I don't know.

535
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:01,298
Is this the direction
you came from?

536
01:23:01,509 --> 01:23:06,310
Yeah. It's not exactly a hut,
but further in I have a place to sleep.

537
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,853
- You got any bullets?
- Yeah. I use 'em sparingly.

538
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:21,788
Did you mistake me for a monkey
and almost shoot me?

539
01:23:21,997 --> 01:23:24,090
You gotta be kidding!

540
01:23:38,446 --> 01:23:39,504
It's Tamura.

541
01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:43,343
I didn't recognize him at first either.
He's changed so much.

542
01:23:44,652 --> 01:23:46,085
Tamura?

543
01:23:46,921 --> 01:23:48,650
What happened to you?

544
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:53,191
I collapsed.
Nagamatsu found me.

545
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:56,764
Isn't the war over yet?

546
01:23:57,532 --> 01:23:59,397
Like he would know?

547
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:03,469
He's been drifting around
just like us.

548
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:06,840
You got any food?

549
01:24:07,842 --> 01:24:09,309
Not a thing.

550
01:24:10,178 --> 01:24:12,738
I've been eating
grass and leeches.

551
01:24:12,947 --> 01:24:15,609
- No rifle either?
- No.

552
01:24:16,918 --> 01:24:20,251
Oh, yeah.
I have a grenade.

553
01:24:21,089 --> 01:24:22,556
A grenade?

554
01:24:26,528 --> 01:24:28,553
Wait. No, I don't.

555
01:24:30,698 --> 01:24:32,290
I must've lost it.

556
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:34,491
What a waste.

557
01:24:34,702 --> 01:24:37,136
Could've thrown it in the pond
to get some fish.

558
01:24:37,338 --> 01:24:40,899
- Don't you guys have any?
- We used ours.

559
01:24:41,142 --> 01:24:43,906
All we've got now is his rifle.

560
01:24:44,612 --> 01:24:49,549
He hunts monkeys with it.
Only thing keeping us alive.

561
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:26,446
- How many pieces left?
- Not many.

562
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:29,452
- I said how many!
- What difference does it make?

563
01:25:29,657 --> 01:25:34,026
We agreed we'd only eat three a day.
Now let's have the tobacco.

564
01:25:34,229 --> 01:25:36,424
Okay, but we've got
another mouth to feed.

565
01:25:36,631 --> 01:25:39,759
You'd better find another monkey.

566
01:25:52,680 --> 01:25:54,773
Who's gonna share with Tamura?

567
01:25:55,984 --> 01:25:58,885
It oughta be you.
You brought him here.

568
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:02,081
He can't chew anyway.

569
01:26:02,857 --> 01:26:04,722
I don't need any.

570
01:26:04,926 --> 01:26:07,360
It's softer cooked.

571
01:26:07,562 --> 01:26:10,827
He said he doesn't need any.
Why force him?

572
01:26:11,032 --> 01:26:12,499
Fool!

573
01:26:12,834 --> 01:26:15,632
Don't tell me he came here
in order not to eat.

574
01:26:15,837 --> 01:26:18,362
I'll eat some
when my teeth are better.

575
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:21,508
You bet you will!
I'll see to that!

576
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:25,941
What are you so mad about?
It's just monkey meat.

577
01:26:28,383 --> 01:26:29,577
You're right.

578
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,888
You're damn right.

579
01:26:36,491 --> 01:26:38,789
Have some leaves.

580
01:26:38,993 --> 01:26:40,460
Thanks.

581
01:26:40,929 --> 01:26:42,863
Leave some for us.

582
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:49,392
Chew and then spit it out,
or you'll get the runs.

583
01:26:54,275 --> 01:26:55,742
I'm not worried.

584
01:26:56,077 --> 01:26:58,375
I've been eating raw grass.

585
01:28:18,259 --> 01:28:20,557
Hey, Tamura.

586
01:28:20,762 --> 01:28:23,060
What's so great about smoking?

587
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:26,556
It's poison to the system.

588
01:28:27,335 --> 01:28:29,462
Smokers are a bunch of idiots.

589
01:28:30,571 --> 01:28:32,300
Isn't that right?

590
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:34,270
I really don't know.

591
01:29:03,304 --> 01:29:04,965
Here's some water.

592
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:08,107
Ready to hit the sack?

593
01:29:09,544 --> 01:29:13,207
- Don't you sleep here?
- No, over that way. You coming?

594
01:29:13,414 --> 01:29:14,972
I'm okay here.

595
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:17,117
Come on.
It's not far.

596
01:29:17,318 --> 01:29:20,014
He said he's all right here.

597
01:29:20,221 --> 01:29:23,190
Yasuda's leg
starts hurting at night.

598
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:26,360
His moaning won't let you sleep.
Let's go.

599
01:29:27,328 --> 01:29:29,990
Why can't he stay here
if he wants to?

600
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:34,798
Your bed is quite far.

601
01:29:35,002 --> 01:29:38,961
Not really.
I wish it were further.

602
01:29:39,173 --> 01:29:43,109
- Why not sleep where he does?
- Don't tell him where I sleep.

603
01:29:43,311 --> 01:29:47,509
He says his leg's a wreck,
but he can walk, I tell you.

604
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:50,445
I don't sleep there

605
01:29:50,651 --> 01:29:54,178
'cause I don't want him
stealing my rifle.

606
01:29:54,389 --> 01:29:57,051
- Why would he?
- You'll see.

607
01:29:57,258 --> 01:30:00,091
I brought you here
'cause I trust you.

608
01:30:00,294 --> 01:30:01,283
Me?

609
01:30:01,496 --> 01:30:04,124
Careful he doesn't
steal your grenade.

610
01:30:04,332 --> 01:30:05,697
But I don't have -

611
01:30:05,900 --> 01:30:07,697
Yes, you do.

612
01:30:08,636 --> 01:30:12,663
- How'd you know?
- I can feel it.

613
01:30:17,011 --> 01:30:19,605
I really thought I'd lost it.

614
01:30:21,616 --> 01:30:23,015
I know.

615
01:30:23,217 --> 01:30:27,244
I used to keep it in my pocket.

616
01:30:27,455 --> 01:30:29,389
I said I know.

617
01:30:29,590 --> 01:30:33,822
- I forgot I moved it.
- I believe you already!

618
01:30:53,948 --> 01:30:55,677
You're good at that.

619
01:30:55,883 --> 01:31:00,081
Watching the fire is Yasuda's job.
It's hell to restart if it goes out.

620
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:03,355
- It started raining.
- Is that my fault?

621
01:31:03,558 --> 01:31:05,423
How you gonna catch
any monkeys?

622
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:07,821
They might be around,
even in the rain.

623
01:31:08,029 --> 01:31:10,361
I'm going.
- I'll go with you.

624
01:31:10,565 --> 01:31:14,331
You can't walk.
Wait till you're better.

625
01:31:22,577 --> 01:31:26,172
I'm still sleepy.
I'll take a nap at Nagamatsu's.

626
01:31:26,380 --> 01:31:28,439
You can sleep here.

627
01:31:28,649 --> 01:31:31,982
Come over here,
out of the rain.

628
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:35,178
You won't get wet.

629
01:31:37,024 --> 01:31:39,857
I'm glad you showed up.

630
01:31:40,561 --> 01:31:44,497
Nagamatsu's gotten real uppity.
Fights me on everything.

631
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:48,992
He'd be dead by now
if not for me.

632
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:52,100
I taught him to shoot monkeys.

633
01:31:52,306 --> 01:31:54,206
Are there that many around?

634
01:31:54,876 --> 01:31:56,776
I haven't seen any.

635
01:31:56,978 --> 01:31:59,446
It's not like the place
is crawling with 'em.

636
01:31:59,647 --> 01:32:03,640
They don't come out
in the rain, do they?

637
01:32:05,319 --> 01:32:07,514
The rainy season's winding down.

638
01:32:08,055 --> 01:32:12,151
It seems to have stopped.

639
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:14,891
I think I'll take a look around.

640
01:32:15,863 --> 01:32:18,855
Where's the pond where you said
I could use my grenade to fish?

641
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:23,531
That was a long time ago.
It's a long ways away.

642
01:32:24,906 --> 01:32:27,466
I thought you lost your grenade.

643
01:32:27,675 --> 01:32:30,473
It was in my haversack.

644
01:32:32,480 --> 01:32:35,210
It could've gotten wet in the rain.

645
01:32:35,416 --> 01:32:37,247
Let's see it.

646
01:32:43,090 --> 01:32:44,819
A 99, isn't it?

647
01:32:45,026 --> 01:32:47,392
Properly set, too.

648
01:32:47,595 --> 01:32:49,426
It's still good.

649
01:32:49,630 --> 01:32:50,654
Give it back.

650
01:32:50,865 --> 01:32:54,460
I'll look after it for you.
You'll get it wet.

651
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:58,867
Give it back.
Nagamatsu's gonna be angry.

652
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:01,098
Did he say something?

653
01:33:01,309 --> 01:33:03,277
He said not to let you have it.

654
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:05,903
- Then why did you?
- I wasn't thinking.

655
01:33:06,113 --> 01:33:08,843
Too bad.
It's too late now.

656
01:33:09,050 --> 01:33:10,039
Give it back.

657
01:33:14,622 --> 01:33:15,953
All right.

658
01:33:17,825 --> 01:33:20,157
If you want it that bad,
you can have it.

659
01:33:20,361 --> 01:33:22,226
Just put that thing away.

660
01:33:24,665 --> 01:33:27,031
You catch on quick.

661
01:33:37,778 --> 01:33:39,541
He got one!

662
01:33:58,733 --> 01:34:00,667
Come back here!

663
01:34:20,788 --> 01:34:22,813
Stop. Don't.

664
01:34:23,891 --> 01:34:25,017
I get it.

665
01:34:39,740 --> 01:34:41,708
- Did you see?
- Yes.

666
01:34:42,877 --> 01:34:47,109
The monkey got away.
No telling when I'll find another.

667
01:34:48,382 --> 01:34:50,543
There's one right in front of you.

668
01:35:00,327 --> 01:35:02,022
Where's your grenade?

669
01:35:02,963 --> 01:35:05,295
- I don't have it.
- You don't?

670
01:35:05,733 --> 01:35:09,362
You just thought I did.

671
01:35:09,670 --> 01:35:12,901
- What happened to it?
- Yasuda took it.

672
01:35:13,107 --> 01:35:15,007
What? You idiot!

673
01:35:15,209 --> 01:35:17,234
After what I told you!

674
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:19,407
I wasn't thinking.

675
01:35:20,281 --> 01:35:21,942
I've got no choice now.

676
01:35:22,149 --> 01:35:24,982
I've gotta kill him
before he kills me.

677
01:35:25,186 --> 01:35:27,746
We gotta get him to use it.

678
01:35:27,955 --> 01:35:31,550
He'll throw it when I shout.
When he does, run.

679
01:35:37,998 --> 01:35:42,094
Yasuda, I got a monkey!

680
01:35:51,145 --> 01:35:53,113
Stupid son of a bitch
fell for it!

681
01:36:32,186 --> 01:36:36,145
That's strange. The stream's
dammed up, just like I left it.

682
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:45,591
This is the only place
around with water.

683
01:36:45,800 --> 01:36:48,792
It flows from here
to the forest below.

684
01:36:50,137 --> 01:36:53,504
Where'd the bastard go?

685
01:36:53,707 --> 01:36:58,303
It's been three days.
He didn't have much water.

686
01:36:58,512 --> 01:37:02,039
No telling how long
the old bastard can hold out.

687
01:37:02,249 --> 01:37:04,547
- Let's just get out of here.
- No.

688
01:37:05,452 --> 01:37:07,386
We're out of food.

689
01:37:08,022 --> 01:37:12,356
We'll kill him and cook him up,
then surrender to the Yanks.

690
01:37:13,327 --> 01:37:18,196
No one will know I ate "monkey meat"
if I don't say anything.

691
01:37:19,133 --> 01:37:20,964
You know the way to Ormoc, right?

692
01:37:22,870 --> 01:37:24,497
I don't remember.

693
01:37:27,141 --> 01:37:29,234
Why don't you just
kill me and eat me?

694
01:37:29,443 --> 01:37:32,435
I could've done that long ago,

695
01:37:32,646 --> 01:37:36,377
but I've got no hankering
for TB germs.

696
01:37:37,818 --> 01:37:40,514
I'm sick of the whole thing anyway.

697
01:37:41,889 --> 01:37:44,517
That old shit talked me
into all this,

698
01:37:44,725 --> 01:37:46,556
but enough is enough.

699
01:37:46,760 --> 01:37:50,787
That asshole's bullying
gets on my nerves.

700
01:37:50,998 --> 01:37:53,364
I won't be happy
till I finish him off.

701
01:38:04,144 --> 01:38:07,272
- There's smoke rising.
- Is it a signal?

702
01:38:10,918 --> 01:38:15,787
No, a prairie fire.
I hear they're for burning corn husks.

703
01:38:17,291 --> 01:38:20,089
I'm gonna go see.
- Don't be a fool.

704
01:38:21,929 --> 01:38:23,692
They're farmers.

705
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:28,130
Forget it.
They're not Japanese farmers.

706
01:38:29,370 --> 01:38:32,032
Let's head
for the Ormoc highway.

707
01:38:32,539 --> 01:38:35,064
The Americans won't make it
easy to surrender.

708
01:38:35,276 --> 01:38:38,245
You'll be fine
as long as you're with me.

709
01:38:39,546 --> 01:38:43,573
I'm not surrendering.
You go on alone.

710
01:38:43,784 --> 01:38:45,718
Stop talking nonsense.

711
01:38:55,329 --> 01:38:56,819
It's him!

712
01:38:57,631 --> 01:38:59,929
He's finally come out.

713
01:39:03,537 --> 01:39:06,665
Nagamatsu! Tamura!

714
01:39:07,875 --> 01:39:09,843
I was wrong!

715
01:39:10,044 --> 01:39:12,478
Let's make up!

716
01:39:13,714 --> 01:39:17,548
Come on out!
I've got a fire going!

717
01:39:17,751 --> 01:39:19,480
We've got one too!

718
01:39:19,820 --> 01:39:21,481
Come out!

719
01:39:22,089 --> 01:39:24,182
You can have all my tobacco!

720
01:39:25,025 --> 01:39:27,687
We've had enough
of your tender mercies!

721
01:39:27,895 --> 01:39:29,886
I'll just kill you and take it.

722
01:39:30,364 --> 01:39:34,698
Don't think
I've got it on me now!

723
01:39:34,902 --> 01:39:37,769
It's hidden away nice and good!

724
01:39:38,739 --> 01:39:40,900
Let's be friends!

725
01:39:41,508 --> 01:39:45,274
He's a clever bastard.

726
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:12,452
Hold on, Tamura.

727
01:42:14,595 --> 01:42:16,256
Don't do it.

728
01:42:16,964 --> 01:42:19,728
I know what you want.

729
01:43:18,492 --> 01:43:21,290
There are farmers around that fire.

730
01:43:22,829 --> 01:43:26,196
I know it's dangerous to go there...

731
01:43:28,302 --> 01:43:33,604
but I want to see people
leading normal lives.

732
01:44:08,508 --> 01:44:16,279
THE PHILIPPINE FRONT
FEBRUARY 1946

733
01:44:25,359 --> 01:44:32,060
THE END
