Normal ears.

Get dressed.

24
00:03:11,053 --> 00:03:13,475
ln the opinion of the undersigned,

25
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:18,154
based on morphological
and behavioral data,

26
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,059
the subject could well belong

27
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:25,669
to the Semitic race.

28
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:30,918
Her ancestry could be eitherJewish,

29
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,285
Armenian,

30
00:03:33,358 --> 00:03:35,267
or Arab.

31
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:39,840
For now, the case must be
considered doubtful.

32
00:03:48,397 --> 00:03:49,608
You can go.

33
00:03:49,678 --> 00:03:51,336
How much do l owe you?

34
00:03:51,406 --> 00:03:52,867
See my secretary.

35
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:55,592
You'll be notified
by the prefecture of police.

00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10,330
Fifteen francs.

37
00:04:48,814 --> 00:04:50,669
How did it go?

38
00:04:51,598 --> 00:04:53,027
All right.

39
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:56,200
- What about you?
- All right.

40
00:05:01,294 --> 00:05:03,149
Did he tell you anything?

41
00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,445
And you?

42
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,318
<i>- Mr. Klein?
- Yes, that's me.</i>

43

<i>Would you please come in?</i>

44
00:05:22,606 --> 00:05:24,264
<i>I wanted to see you.</i>

45
00:05:24,334 --> 00:05:27,912
<i>I have something
that might interest you.</i>

46
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,626
<i>Did a mutual friend send you?</i>

47
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,077
<i>I don't believe we've met.</i>

48
00:05:36,398 --> 00:05:39,813
<i>I was told you might be interested</i>

49
00:05:39,886 --> 00:05:42,406
<i>in purchasing paintings.</i>

50
00:05:43,022 --> 00:05:45,510
<i>Well,yes, I might be.</i>

51
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:50,566
<i>I have a painting here.</i>

52
00:05:50,638 --> 00:05:52,525
<i>It's a work by Adriaen van Ostade,</i>

53
00:05:53,422 --> 00:05:55,527
<i>a portrait of a gentleman.</i>

54
00:05:55,598 --> 00:05:59,242
<i>It's an authentic painting,
signed and dated.</i>

55
00:06:00,398 --> 00:06:03,570
<i>It appears in the catalog.</i>

56
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:05,098
<i>Snow</i>

<i>Fables, dreams,</i>

62
00:06:15,854 --> 00:06:18,090
<i>spells, illusions.</i>

63
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:20,358
<i>And suddenly</i>

64
00:06:20,429 --> 00:06:22,404
<i>the blue glare and the red blaze</i>

65
00:06:22,478 --> 00:06:25,128
<i>of the young Phalangists.</i>

66
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,203
<i>The flower,</i>

67
00:06:27,278 --> 00:06:29,318

<i>The paladins.!</i>

69
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:34,825
<i>On the horizon,
the pinnacles of Leningrad</i>

70
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:36,998
<i>appear and disappear</i>

71
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:38,979
<i>like a mirage.</i>

72
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:40,820
<i>Six hundred louis.</i>

<i>Three hundred.</i>

00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,057
<i>You must bejoking.</i>

75

<i>At that price, I'd rather keep it.</i>

76
00:06:52,877 --> 00:06:55,020
<i>As you wish.</i>

77
00:06:56,877 --> 00:06:59,692
<i>It's easy for you,
when a man is forced to sell.</i>

78
00:07:00,334 --> 00:07:02,308
<i>But I'm not forced to buy.</i>

79
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:05,500
<i>I'm not a collector.</i>

80
00:07:04,845 --> 00:07:06,339
<i>For me</i>

81
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,903

82
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:12,486
<i>Make me a reasonable offer.</i>

83
00:07:13,966 --> 00:07:15,078

00:07:30,509 --> 00:07:32,230
Robert!

85
00:07:31,821 --> 00:07:33,512
Go back to bed.

86
00:07:33,582 --> 00:07:35,175
- Why?
- ""Why?''

87
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,101
Why do you think?

88
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:41,316
- Wait a minute.
- Later. Go back to bed.

89
00:08:15,853 --> 00:08:18,406
lf it were a matter of francs,

90
00:08:18,477 --> 00:08:20,070
instead of gold louis...

91
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,587
lt's true that francs
are worthless abroad,

92
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:25,832
but if you need money in France --

93
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:30,146
l don't need it in France.

94
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,291
Very well.

95
00:08:32,942 --> 00:08:34,600
Let's make out a receipt.

96
00:08:36,526 --> 00:08:38,435
lt's just a formality.
lt's for me.

97
00:08:39,085 --> 00:08:41,027
lt'll stay in my safe.

98
00:08:45,453 --> 00:08:47,046
Here. Write it yourself.

99
00:08:47,694 --> 00:08:50,596
Unless you have a receipt
from whoever sold it to you.

100
00:08:54,509 --> 00:08:57,160
We've always had it in our house.

101
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,979
Always.

102
00:09:00,109 --> 00:09:01,900
Well, perhaps my grandfather,

103
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,683
when he came from Holland.

104
00:09:04,813 --> 00:09:06,439
Or perhaps his father.

105
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:08,550
Yes.

106
00:09:07,854 --> 00:09:11,260
lt's a long time ago.
lt doesn't matter.

107
00:09:12,013 --> 00:09:13,638
lt's just a formality.

108
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,433
Now would you write

109
00:09:16,077 --> 00:09:17,670
""l, the undersigned'' --

00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:26,960
No, never mind the address.

No, but it doesn't matter.

126
00:10:55,534 --> 00:10:57,388
Don't you want to count it?

127

Wait. l'll give you a present.

128

No, thank you.
Don't bother.

May l take one?

Yes, of course.

Although l'd rather--

134
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,994
That is, recently,
l've seen many clients like you,

And l assure you
it's most unpleasant for me.

137
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:37,026
Fmbarrassing.

138
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,557
Very often l'd rather not buy.

139
00:11:41,389 --> 00:11:43,211

A straight line

White: cruelty.

An acute angle with its point

Black: arrogance.

00:13:45,069 --> 00:13:47,622
- Did you forget?
- The console table.

172
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:49,034
There's still time.

173
00:13:49,101 --> 00:13:50,694
l'm going to get a coffee.
l'll be back.

174
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,246
What do you think of the tapestry?

175
00:13:54,893 --> 00:13:56,998
l think it's bad luck.

176
00:14:56,301 --> 00:14:58,000
NOJ FWS ALLOWFD

177
00:15:00,173 --> 00:15:01,383
Hello.

178
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:07,970
Thank you.

179
00:15:10,381 --> 00:15:12,356
l just phoned.

180
00:15:14,285 --> 00:15:17,430
This morning l received your paper

181
00:15:16,845 --> 00:15:18,122
addressed to me.

182
00:15:19,213 --> 00:15:22,344
l'm not a subscriber,
and l have no intention of--

183
00:15:23,245 --> 00:15:25,612
l mean, l have no reason to be.

184
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:29,035
lsn't your paper sent
only to subscribers?

185
00:15:31,021 --> 00:15:34,698
lt's our only way to keep
the community informed

186
00:15:35,341 --> 00:15:37,065
about meetings, decisions

187
00:15:37,133 --> 00:15:39,880
and new measures set up
by the authorities, and so on.

188
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:41,410
l understand,

189
00:15:40,845 --> 00:15:42,503
but l don't belong to your--

190
00:15:43,245 --> 00:15:45,033
Yes, l understand.

191
00:15:46,605 --> 00:15:48,198
lt's strange.

192
00:15:48,845 --> 00:15:51,114
Unless someone else --

193
00:15:52,141 --> 00:15:54,279
perhaps a friend of yours --

194
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:55,942
subscribed for you.

195
00:15:56,813 --> 00:15:58,439
That's impossible.

196
00:15:58,509 --> 00:16:01,640
No one would play
that sort of joke on me.

197
00:16:04,365 --> 00:16:08,293
You think we make
a good subject for jokes?

198
00:16:12,013 --> 00:16:13,606
No, l didn't mean that.

199
00:16:13,677 --> 00:16:16,328
But the very idea seems so absurd.

200
00:16:16,397 --> 00:16:18,306
Please excuse me.

201
00:16:20,237 --> 00:16:22,888
So you no longer wish
to receive our newspaper?

202
00:16:22,957 --> 00:16:24,233
Fxactly.

203
00:16:25,037 --> 00:16:29,412
l would also like to know
why you sent it to me.

204
00:16:30,381 --> 00:16:32,584
l understand. Unfortunately,

205
00:16:33,229 --> 00:16:37,157
we must wait until the prefecture
returns our list of subscribers.

206
00:16:37,229 --> 00:16:38,822
Then we can check.

207
00:16:38,893 --> 00:16:42,406
- The prefecture?
- Yes, the prefecture of police.

208
00:16:43,565 --> 00:16:46,100
You give your lists to the police?

209
00:16:46,637 --> 00:16:50,565
They're the ones who've allowed us
and advised us to publish this newspaper.

210
00:16:51,148 --> 00:16:54,215
As l told you,
it's the only way we have --

211
00:16:55,373 --> 00:16:57,315
Yes, l understand.

212
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,139
Where is the prefecture?

213
00:17:00,205 --> 00:17:02,539
The Commission forJewish Affairs.

214
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:12,250
Robert Klein, did you say?

215
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:13,959
Yes.

216
00:17:25,325 --> 00:17:26,918
Like that?

217
00:17:30,989 --> 00:17:32,298
Address?

218
00:17:32,941 --> 00:17:34,402
1 36 Rue du Bac.

219
00:17:35,373 --> 00:17:37,195
How long have you lived there?

220
00:17:38,253 --> 00:17:40,358
About seven years,
since l came to Paris.

221
00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:46,468
Yes, in fact,
there is a Robert Klein.

222
00:17:47,373 --> 00:17:49,642
But at another address.

223
00:17:50,285 --> 00:17:52,489
Obviously a man with the same name.

224
00:17:52,557 --> 00:17:53,986
May l have his address?

225
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,689
What would you say if l gave yours
to anyone who asked for it?

226
00:18:05,261 --> 00:18:06,690
Take it away.

227
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:18,680
Where did you say you lived?

228
00:18:21,613 --> 00:18:23,555
1 36 Rue du Bac.

229
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,120
The fact remains, someone
wrote my name on the paper. Why?

230
00:18:29,517 --> 00:18:31,241
You understand my concern?

231
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:34,025
Perfectly.

232
00:18:34,093 --> 00:18:38,566
lt's more curiosity than anxiety.
The fact someone would --

233
00:18:43,341 --> 00:18:45,545
l'm sorry.
l'm taking up your time.

234
00:18:46,413 --> 00:18:48,584
Such things can't interest the police.

235
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:55,046
Luckily for me.

236
00:20:06,829 --> 00:20:09,895
What does ""Moby Dick'' mean?
ls it a name?

237
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:11,239
Yes.

238
00:20:12,460 --> 00:20:13,890
A woman's name?

239
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,002
No, a whale's.

240
00:20:27,021 --> 00:20:29,388
He's exactly like me.

241
00:20:29,453 --> 00:20:31,046
Who's that?

242
00:20:31,117 --> 00:20:32,546
lshmael.

243
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:34,950
Listen to this.

244
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,124
""Sixteen hours in bed.

245
00:20:38,189 --> 00:20:40,261
The small of my back ached.

246
00:20:41,325 --> 00:20:43,234
l felt worse and worse.

247
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,000
At last, l got up

248
00:20:46,029 --> 00:20:47,900
and threw myself at her feet,

249
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,277
beseeching her to beat me,

250
00:20:50,348 --> 00:20:52,072
to do anything, indeed,

251
00:20:52,141 --> 00:20:55,620
but condemn me to lie in bed

252
00:20:54,861 --> 00:20:58,603
for such an unendurable
length of time.''

253
00:21:11,885 --> 00:21:13,478
Can l get up?

254
00:21:17,389 --> 00:21:19,331
Do me a favor:
Get a different book.

255
00:21:21,357 --> 00:21:23,266
The one with the pink cover.

256
00:21:39,117 --> 00:21:40,523
""Chloé.''

257
00:21:42,221 --> 00:21:43,650
From the beginning?

258
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:45,416
Wherever you'd like.

259
00:21:47,629 --> 00:21:49,003
Page 47.

260
00:21:49,069 --> 00:21:51,290
""Pale and trembling like doves,

261
00:21:50,828 --> 00:21:53,080
the three maidens entered the room.

262
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,667
ln the dancing firelight,

263
00:21:55,030 --> 00:21:57,100
it looked even more
imposing and fantastic'' --

264
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,226
lt can't be.

265
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,369
Go on.

266
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,162
l can't.

267
00:22:04,397 --> 00:22:05,826
Go on.

268
00:22:08,204 --> 00:22:10,986
""lmposing and fantastic.

269
00:22:12,173 --> 00:22:14,442
That enormous penis,

270
00:22:15,372 --> 00:22:17,227
tumescent,

271
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:18,950
superb,

272
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,133
alive.''

273
00:22:40,813 --> 00:22:42,405
Go on.

274
00:22:57,676 --> 00:22:59,651
<i>I know very little about him.</i>

275
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,961
<i>I never saw much ofhim.</i>

276
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:04,036
The girl took care of everything.

277
00:23:04,109 --> 00:23:05,931
A brunette,

278
00:23:05,997 --> 00:23:07,590
pretty sexy.

279
00:23:07,661 --> 00:23:09,897
l think she was a whore

280
00:23:09,964 --> 00:23:11,557
or a dancer.

281
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:15,930
He only went out at night
when l was in bed.

282
00:23:17,228 --> 00:23:18,854
Around midnight,
after curfew,

283
00:23:18,925 --> 00:23:20,583
l'd hear him come down the stairs.

284
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:24,250
And the morning l saw him,

285
00:23:23,821 --> 00:23:27,530
it was about 5:00.
l was taking out the trash.

286
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,990
There he is!

287
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:36,135
You're Mr. Klein, aren't you,
from the second floor?

288
00:23:37,421 --> 00:23:39,014
No, l'm sorry.

289
00:23:39,693 --> 00:23:41,318
l'm not your Mr. Klein.

290
00:23:41,805 --> 00:23:43,234
Pardon me.

291
00:23:44,397 --> 00:23:45,804
l thought you were him.

292
00:23:47,148 --> 00:23:49,898
Same height, same hair,just as slim.

293
00:23:49,964 --> 00:23:51,687
The same look.

294
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:54,571
Because l never saw
the other one's face.

295
00:23:55,917 --> 00:23:58,420
What do you want?

296
00:23:57,837 --> 00:24:00,968
l've come about the apartment.
ls it still available?

297
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,033
- lf you don't mind waiting a minute.
- Not at all.

298
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:08,964
We're finished.
What about the calling card?

299
00:24:09,037 --> 00:24:09,985
Yes, it's right here.

300
00:24:11,021 --> 00:24:13,639
Wait, l'll write down
the address for his mail.

301
00:24:14,605 --> 00:24:17,638
- Does he still get mail?
- Yes, but not much.

302
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,301
A newspaper, a letter.

303
00:24:19,372 --> 00:24:20,801
Nothing else.

304
00:24:24,332 --> 00:24:26,242
So you want to move in here?

305
00:24:26,317 --> 00:24:28,618
No, it's for a friend
who's coming to Paris.

306
00:24:30,092 --> 00:24:31,816
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

307
00:24:33,516 --> 00:24:35,109
lf you hear anything, call us.

308
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,838
Yes, certainly.

309
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:44,453
Good-bye.

310
00:24:47,245 --> 00:24:49,252
Do you really want
to see the apartment?

311
00:25:01,229 --> 00:25:03,530
The wallpaper needs changing.
lt's all moldy.

312
00:25:04,844 --> 00:25:07,010
The ceiling needs painting.

313
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:11,145
The toilet bowl's got to be changed.

314
00:25:12,524 --> 00:25:15,077
And you'd have to get rid of the rats.

315
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,611
- Rats?
- Yes, rats.

316
00:25:18,156 --> 00:25:20,066
Look at this.

317
00:25:20,141 --> 00:25:22,040
All over the place.

318
00:25:32,396 --> 00:25:34,535
No, this is no place for you.

319
00:25:34,604 --> 00:25:37,190
lf you're interested,

320
00:25:37,261 --> 00:25:38,854
it's 1 50 francs a month.

321
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:41,130
Outrageous.

322
00:25:40,812 --> 00:25:43,495
Plus electricity
and a maintenance fee.

323
00:26:05,292 --> 00:26:06,885
He had a dog?

324
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:09,640
Yes, a German shepherd.

325
00:26:11,021 --> 00:26:13,225
Sometimes he'd bark
and then whimper

326
00:26:13,868 --> 00:26:16,072
as if he were being beaten.

327
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,610
My husband always said you could
judge a house by the bathroom,

328
00:26:44,684 --> 00:26:46,277
and he was right.

329
00:26:48,205 --> 00:26:50,408
Well? Haven't you seen enough?

330
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:55,432
- The shower?
- lt's out of order.

331
00:27:13,517 --> 00:27:14,945
What's wrong?

332
00:27:18,028 --> 00:27:19,621
l'm sorry,

333
00:27:19,692 --> 00:27:22,474
but since my husband
has been gone,

334
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,489
l get funny.

335
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,467
Fvery now and then,

336
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,251
l have these hallucinations.

337
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:34,214
ls your husband dead?

338
00:27:36,268 --> 00:27:37,861
No, he's in Germany.

339
00:27:37,932 --> 00:27:39,525
Prisoner of war.

340
00:27:51,852 --> 00:27:53,445
Yes, l remember.

341
00:27:54,093 --> 00:27:56,035
A pretty girl and a beautiful dog.

342
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:06,282
You, on the other hand,

343
00:28:06,348 --> 00:28:07,941
your face was hidden.

344
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:10,533
But you're recognizable.

345
00:28:11,468 --> 00:28:13,640
Do you still have that sidecar?

346
00:28:14,412 --> 00:28:16,321
No, it got blown up.

347
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:27,650
May l?

348
00:29:32,140 --> 00:29:33,569
Good evening.

349
00:29:39,564 --> 00:29:41,539
Who's that skeleton in your house?

350
00:29:41,612 --> 00:29:42,987
What skeleton?

351
00:29:43,052 --> 00:29:43,946
That whore!

352
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,853
What do you mean?

353
00:29:48,012 --> 00:29:49,506
A girl called Janine.

354
00:29:53,292 --> 00:29:55,560
A friend.

355
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,995
Why did l find her here?

356
00:30:10,636 --> 00:30:12,643
Because you got here after her.

357
00:30:14,476 --> 00:30:16,418
She was alone in the house.

358
00:30:17,132 --> 00:30:19,610
Because she got here first.

359
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:22,149
ls your husband here?

360
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:26,664
Yes.

361
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:31,458
And two policemen
are waiting for you.

362
00:30:54,892 --> 00:30:56,168
Good evening.

363
00:30:58,476 --> 00:30:59,905
Sorry l'm late.

364
00:31:04,204 --> 00:31:05,611
Listen.

365
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:07,973
They're waiting for you.

366
00:31:08,044 --> 00:31:09,473
Yes, your wife told me.

367
00:31:09,548 --> 00:31:12,548
- What's going on?
- Nothing. l'll explain later.

368
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:20,609
Good evening.

369
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,581
l have the impression
we've met before.

370
00:31:24,652 --> 00:31:26,245
We have that same impression.

371
00:31:26,892 --> 00:31:29,347
Did you rent that apartment
for your friend after all?

372
00:31:29,516 --> 00:31:32,134
No, l haven't made up my mind yet.

373
00:31:33,324 --> 00:31:35,463
We brought back your card.

374
00:31:35,532 --> 00:31:37,125
Thank you very much.

375
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:40,554
l have a terrible habit
of handing them out everywhere.

376
00:31:42,156 --> 00:31:44,131
- How about a drink?
- No, thank you.

377
00:31:44,204 --> 00:31:45,992
But you go ahead.
We can wait.

378
00:31:47,308 --> 00:31:49,064
Are we going somewhere?

379
00:31:49,132 --> 00:31:50,561
The Pigalle police station.

380
00:31:50,636 --> 00:31:53,124
Again?
l went there after l saw you.

381
00:31:53,196 --> 00:31:55,530
l spoke to the inspector
just five minutes ago.

382
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,555
Pierre, please turn down
the phonograph.

383
00:32:00,812 --> 00:32:03,300
Nicole, would you get me a beer?

384
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,274
Maybe you should call him.
That would save time.

385
00:32:17,068 --> 00:32:18,497
Pigalle 30-30?

386
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,493
- Call him, François.
- May l?

387
00:32:23,564 --> 00:32:24,993
Go right ahead.

388
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:38,981
You bastard.

389
00:32:39,052 --> 00:32:40,940
lnspector, we're here with Mr. Klein.

390
00:32:45,996 --> 00:32:47,818
Yes, sir. Very well.

391
00:32:53,004 --> 00:32:54,914
Who could this other Klein be?

392
00:32:54,987 --> 00:32:56,416
l have no idea.

393
00:32:57,292 --> 00:33:00,140
l first heard about him
yesterday at the prefecture.

394
00:33:00,204 --> 00:33:02,059
Our orders came from the prefecture.

395
00:33:04,939 --> 00:33:07,143
Anyway, if you hear anything --

396
00:33:07,948 --> 00:33:09,835
Don't worry.
lt's in my interest.

397
00:33:37,292 --> 00:33:39,201
l don't like this business.

398
00:33:40,044 --> 00:33:43,306
So there's a man
who's got the same name, a Jew.

399
00:33:43,372 --> 00:33:46,640
He's gone off and left you
with his problem.

400
00:33:45,867 --> 00:33:47,460
How could he know about me?

401
00:33:47,948 --> 00:33:50,086
Your calling cards are all over Paris.

402
00:33:50,156 --> 00:33:51,585
lt doesn't make any sense.

403
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:54,529
Does he expect me
to just shut up and take his place?

404
00:33:55,596 --> 00:33:57,668
lt's someone with a grudge
against me

405
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:00,106
trying to get me into trouble,
provoke me.

406
00:34:00,588 --> 00:34:03,290
Why should he have
a grudge against you?

407
00:34:02,828 --> 00:34:05,400
And why not?

408
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:48,394
""My love,

409
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:51,640
what interminable months!

410
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:52,616
ln two days,
it'll be ourJanuary 26th.

411
00:36:52,684 --> 00:36:54,626
l'm here, waiting for you.

412
00:36:55,276 --> 00:36:59,138
The train to lvry la Bataille
still leaves at 6:1 5.

413
00:36:59,212 --> 00:37:01,121
You mustn't miss it, you know that?

414
00:37:01,196 --> 00:37:02,985
Because this time, l swear

415
00:37:04,012 --> 00:37:05,026
you'd lose me.

416
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:08,165
And that would be awful,
my darling.

417
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,692
Florence.''

418
00:37:16,107 --> 00:37:17,700
""You mustn't miss it, you know that?

419
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:20,138
Because this time
it would be awful, my darling.

420
00:37:22,443 --> 00:37:24,037
Florence.''

421
00:38:43,436 --> 00:38:45,028
Do you have any baggage?

422
00:38:45,995 --> 00:38:48,210
Please follow me, sir.

423
00:39:56,652 --> 00:39:58,407
Good evening, Mr. Klein.

424
00:39:58,476 --> 00:40:00,101
Please come in.

425
00:40:02,828 --> 00:40:04,421
They're expecting you.

426
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:06,689
May l take your coat?

427
00:40:09,196 --> 00:40:10,472
Please.

428
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:18,273
Good evening.

429
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,586
l'm Charles-Xavier,

430
00:41:21,515 --> 00:41:22,944
your host.

431
00:41:32,587 --> 00:41:35,075
l know, it's a complicated story.

432
00:41:36,971 --> 00:41:38,345
Come with me.

433
00:41:38,603 --> 00:41:40,872
lt's quieter in there.

434
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,980
Yes, then l can explain.

435
00:42:20,876 --> 00:42:24,585
Florence, can you imagine Robert
living in Pigalle?

436
00:42:24,652 --> 00:42:26,244
ln a furnished room?

437
00:42:26,315 --> 00:42:28,454
Robert in Pigalle?

438
00:42:29,131 --> 00:42:30,887
ln lodgings, Rue des Abbesses.

439
00:42:30,955 --> 00:42:33,955
That's impossible.
lt's absurd.

440
00:42:34,027 --> 00:42:35,816
This gentleman has the same name.

441
00:42:35,884 --> 00:42:37,575
Really? Just like Robert?

442
00:42:37,644 --> 00:42:39,236
lsn't that funny.

443
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:40,420
Please.

444
00:42:42,348 --> 00:42:44,519
What was Robert doing in Pigalle?

445
00:42:44,587 --> 00:42:45,994
Nothing.

446
00:42:46,059 --> 00:42:47,848
l don't think he was ever there.

447
00:42:47,915 --> 00:42:51,973
Then God only knows
why this letter was sent to him in Pigalle.

448
00:42:52,044 --> 00:42:53,800
That's right.

449
00:42:53,868 --> 00:42:55,461
There's a letter.

450
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:56,961
They're waiting for us.

451
00:42:57,035 --> 00:42:59,075
Couldn't we read it after dinner?

452
00:42:59,147 --> 00:43:00,576
lt's only a few lines.

453
00:43:01,963 --> 00:43:04,035
We're all starving.

454
00:43:04,107 --> 00:43:05,831
Yes, l see your point.

455
00:43:07,148 --> 00:43:09,384
But if you knew Robert
as well as l do --

456
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:12,548
l can't accept your theory.

457
00:43:12,619 --> 00:43:15,521
We can't be talking
about the same person.

458
00:43:15,596 --> 00:43:17,930
Let's go in to dinner.
Will you stay?

459
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,167
No, thank you.
l must return to Paris.

460
00:43:20,235 --> 00:43:21,828
My train leaves soon.

461
00:43:21,899 --> 00:43:24,071
l don't believe there are
any more trains tonight.

462
00:43:24,139 --> 00:43:26,340
No, only on odd days.

463
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:29,080
You see?
Now you have no excuse.

464
00:43:28,811 --> 00:43:30,819
There must be a hotel nearby.

465
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:32,266
Requisitioned.

466
00:43:32,907 --> 00:43:34,282
Don't worry. You're my guest.

467
00:43:35,307 --> 00:43:36,354
Anyhow,

468
00:43:37,611 --> 00:43:40,459
we did invite you
in a way, didn't we?

469
00:43:40,523 --> 00:43:42,378
Come on.
Now you have no more excuses.

470
00:44:13,035 --> 00:44:15,075
No, don't move.

471
00:44:15,147 --> 00:44:17,100
Don't turn on the light.

472
00:44:23,467 --> 00:44:25,158
Don't turn on the light.

473
00:44:27,179 --> 00:44:28,608
My letter.

474
00:44:28,683 --> 00:44:31,650
Would you mind giving it back to me?

475
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:35,489
Would you mind turning around?

476
00:44:35,563 --> 00:44:36,872
Why?

477
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:40,261
Because l sleep in the nude.

478
00:45:04,267 --> 00:45:05,860
Tell me.

479
00:45:07,883 --> 00:45:10,272
Does your friend happen to beJewish?

480
00:45:10,347 --> 00:45:12,169
Robert? l don't think so.

481
00:45:13,068 --> 00:45:16,166
As far as l know, he's an atheist.

482
00:45:16,908 --> 00:45:19,296
Yet he subscribes
to a Jewish newspaper.

483
00:45:19,371 --> 00:45:22,900
That's possible.
He reads a lot.

484
00:45:23,650 --> 00:45:24,224
And talks very little.

485
00:45:24,299 --> 00:45:26,535
Who told you that?
On the contrary.

486
00:45:27,243 --> 00:45:29,153
Then what did he tell you about me?

487
00:45:29,867 --> 00:45:31,623
Nothing.

488
00:45:31,691 --> 00:45:34,025
He never mentioned you.

489
00:45:34,507 --> 00:45:35,816
No letter, then.

490
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:46,000
l know what Robert would say
if he were here.

491
00:45:46,699 --> 00:45:49,699
First, he'd compare you
to an animal or an insect.

492
00:45:51,371 --> 00:45:54,120
His theory is based on
what he calls

493
00:45:54,187 --> 00:45:57,416
the infinite variety
of specialized instincts.

494
00:45:57,484 --> 00:45:59,905
- How fascinating!
- lsn't it?

495
00:45:59,979 --> 00:46:03,110
He claims that
in animals and insects,

496
00:46:03,179 --> 00:46:05,318
this variety manifests

497
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:07,296
in a series of different species.

498
00:46:07,371 --> 00:46:09,510
But in man this is not possible,

499
00:46:09,579 --> 00:46:11,946
since there's only one human species.

500
00:46:12,011 --> 00:46:14,050
- Therefore --
- l get the point.

501
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:24,934
The eyes are important,

502
00:46:25,003 --> 00:46:26,377
the mouth,

503
00:46:26,443 --> 00:46:28,036
the curve of the lips.

504
00:46:28,850 --> 00:46:31,562
A feeling of being superior to others,

505
00:46:31,627 --> 00:46:33,416
a love of freedom,

506
00:46:33,483 --> 00:46:35,272
egoism.

507
00:46:35,339 --> 00:46:36,680
A bird.

508
00:46:37,067 --> 00:46:38,015
Of prey.

509
00:46:38,091 --> 00:46:39,400
A falcon.

510
00:46:39,468 --> 00:46:41,573
- A vulture.
- Why?

511
00:46:41,643 --> 00:46:44,190
Do l eat corpses?

512
00:46:46,315 --> 00:46:48,966
You don't return letters.

513
00:46:52,235 --> 00:46:53,893
How about your friend?

514
00:46:56,203 --> 00:46:57,991
What animal
did he choose for himself?

515
00:46:58,955 --> 00:47:00,843
The eagle? The lion?

516
00:47:02,410 --> 00:47:03,200
The snake.

517
00:47:03,275 --> 00:47:06,853
A hibernating snake,
waiting for a better season.

518
00:47:08,907 --> 00:47:11,842
l can't understand
why he got you into this mess.

519
00:47:13,963 --> 00:47:15,687
So he could hide, l think.

520
00:47:17,066 --> 00:47:19,271
To disappear behind another man.

521
00:47:20,235 --> 00:47:21,184
Me.

522
00:47:21,259 --> 00:47:23,200
No, he's no coward.

523
00:47:23,275 --> 00:47:25,315
He wouldn't harm anyone.

524
00:47:25,387 --> 00:47:27,143
Fxcept himself, perhaps.

525
00:47:27,211 --> 00:47:30,627
Or else for revenge.
Yes, then he might.

526
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:32,641
But revenge for what?

527
00:47:32,850 --> 00:47:34,690
l don't even know him.

528
00:47:35,339 --> 00:47:38,187
You know what l thought
when l saw you come in?

529
00:47:41,259 --> 00:47:44,500
That Robert himself had sent you.

530
00:47:44,459 --> 00:47:45,407
Why?

531
00:47:45,483 --> 00:47:48,614
To explain to me
why he hadn't come,

532
00:47:48,683 --> 00:47:51,400
to see how l'd react,
to provoke me,

533
00:47:52,043 --> 00:47:53,865
to humiliate me.

534
00:47:53,931 --> 00:47:55,208
l don't understand.

535
00:47:55,275 --> 00:47:57,184
Yes, as if to tell me,

536
00:47:57,259 --> 00:48:01,350
""l'm sending another man in my place,
but it will be all the same to you.''

537
00:48:01,676 --> 00:48:05,188
Yes, he's capable of that.

538
00:48:06,378 --> 00:48:09,281
That seems a little excessive,
don't you think?

539
00:48:09,355 --> 00:48:12,140
He's quite capable of that.

540
00:48:16,875 --> 00:48:18,631
What if it were true?

541
00:48:19,883 --> 00:48:22,080
Suppose that's why l came.

542
00:48:22,379 --> 00:48:25,160
He loves that sort of situation.

543
00:48:26,283 --> 00:48:28,072
So do l.

544
00:48:28,139 --> 00:48:30,350
What about you?

545
00:48:29,835 --> 00:48:31,809
Fven if it's really untrue?

546
00:48:31,883 --> 00:48:33,312
Fspecially.

547
00:48:35,019 --> 00:48:37,507
Or let's suppose --

548
00:48:40,363 --> 00:48:42,534
lt's very late. l must go.

549
00:48:44,203 --> 00:48:46,342
My husband must be looking for me.

550
00:50:36,011 --> 00:50:38,531
We forgot to say good night.

551
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:43,626
l can't sleep when that happens.

552
00:50:50,410 --> 00:50:52,008
l see you have the same problem.

553
00:51:02,091 --> 00:51:04,480
Do you realize
l could go to the police?

554
00:51:09,355 --> 00:51:11,264
Then you must talk.

555
00:51:12,266 --> 00:51:13,892
Where is he?

556
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:17,026
l swear l don't know.

557
00:51:18,315 --> 00:51:20,322
Let's start at the beginning.

558
00:51:21,067 --> 00:51:23,171
Where did he live before Pigalle?

559
00:51:23,979 --> 00:51:26,848
ln a hotel on the Rue de l'Université.

560
00:51:28,395 --> 00:51:30,533
When did you learn about Pigalle?

561
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:32,934
Two months ago.

562
00:51:33,835 --> 00:51:36,150
Through a messenger boy

563
00:51:35,818 --> 00:51:38,917
who brought me
his flute and a note.

564
00:51:40,523 --> 00:51:42,465
What did the note say?

565
00:51:43,242 --> 00:51:44,671
Nothing.

566
00:51:46,090 --> 00:51:47,626
Jokes, as usual.

567
00:51:48,267 --> 00:51:50,209
He said he was going
into hibernation,

568
00:51:50,283 --> 00:51:54,057
and l was to keep his flute
until a better season.

569
00:51:55,466 --> 00:51:57,059
Where did he go into hibernation?

570
00:51:59,435 --> 00:52:01,126
l don't know.

571
00:52:01,195 --> 00:52:03,580
He didn't say.

572
00:52:03,435 --> 00:52:05,061
Very well.

573
00:52:06,059 --> 00:52:07,815
The police will find out.

574
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,162
And you, your husband
and every member of your musical zoo

575
00:52:12,811 --> 00:52:14,404
will be called in for questioning.

576
00:52:16,363 --> 00:52:19,112
Please don't do that.

577
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:22,502
l'm sorry, Florence.

578
00:52:22,571 --> 00:52:25,189
But one way or another,
l must find out

579
00:52:25,259 --> 00:52:27,114
what this man wants from me.

580
00:52:29,547 --> 00:52:30,823
Good-bye.

581
00:52:36,811 --> 00:52:39,112
lt's a shame about last night.

582
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:42,308
Just a moment.

583
00:52:43,915 --> 00:52:45,344
All right.

584
00:52:45,994 --> 00:52:50,631
But first, you must swear
you won't go to the police.

585
00:53:01,419 --> 00:53:02,880
l swear.

586
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:15,585
1 36 Rue du Bac.

587
00:55:02,283 --> 00:55:04,006
You have the present?

588
00:55:04,075 --> 00:55:06,115
l didn't sleep all night.

589
00:55:06,187 --> 00:55:08,500
Neither did l.
Have you got it?

590
00:55:07,851 --> 00:55:10,371
You could have told me.
Some people came looking for you.

591
00:55:10,443 --> 00:55:11,653
What did they want?

592
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:13,151
l don't know.

593
00:55:39,498 --> 00:55:41,450
Pierre.

594
00:55:43,146 --> 00:55:45,400
ls it serious?

595
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,545
Tell me, are the Kleins
full-blooded French,

596
00:55:57,611 --> 00:56:00,000
or are thereJews in your family?

597
00:56:06,123 --> 00:56:07,860
lndifference

598
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:10,689
is like a still, flat sea

599
00:56:11,330 --> 00:56:12,835
surrounding a drowning man.

600
00:56:13,610 --> 00:56:16,512
lt's like a flock of sheep

601
00:56:16,586 --> 00:56:20,034
grazing in the ruins of a village.

602
00:56:20,971 --> 00:56:22,880
Or like a worm

603
00:56:22,954 --> 00:56:26,566
crawling over a putrid wound.

604
00:56:29,163 --> 00:56:33,571
A man can be stingy, selfish,
hypocritical, anything --

605
00:56:33,643 --> 00:56:38,149
as long as he's aware.

606
00:56:40,011 --> 00:56:41,604
The result is the same.

607
00:56:42,603 --> 00:56:44,425
No, not exactly.

608
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:47,971
- Have you ever heard of remorse?
- Yes.

609
00:56:48,586 --> 00:56:51,456
lt's like a vulture

610
00:56:51,531 --> 00:56:54,370
pierced by an arrow,

611
00:56:53,834 --> 00:56:55,590
yet it continues to fly.

612
00:56:55,658 --> 00:56:57,666
Oh, it's you!

613
00:56:58,603 --> 00:57:00,359
What's the matter?

614
00:57:01,354 --> 00:57:04,256
- Why have you come?
- To see you.

615
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:06,697
Yes, of course.
But what else?

616
00:57:07,179 --> 00:57:08,585
Nostalgia...

617
00:57:09,483 --> 00:57:11,141
for my roots.

618
00:57:12,555 --> 00:57:15,522
l want the birth certificates
of my grandparents

619
00:57:15,595 --> 00:57:17,188
on both sides.

620
00:57:18,442 --> 00:57:20,100
And mine too, naturally.

621
00:57:20,170 --> 00:57:22,330
Why?

622
00:57:22,442 --> 00:57:23,871
l told you.

623
00:57:24,138 --> 00:57:27,260
Nostalgia, curiosity.

624
00:57:35,882 --> 00:57:38,981
Don't be an idiot, Robert.
Tell me why.

625
00:57:40,618 --> 00:57:42,211
lt's nothing.

626
00:57:43,083 --> 00:57:46,247
A formality, a routine check.

627
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,023
These days, the Paris police

628
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:52,130
want to prove they exist.

629
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:57,352
So a slight misunderstanding
must be cleared up.

630
00:57:57,994 --> 00:58:00,361
What kind of misunderstanding?

631
00:58:01,226 --> 00:58:02,655
About my identity.

632
00:58:03,010 --> 00:58:05,152
What's that got to do
with your grandparents?

633
00:58:05,226 --> 00:58:07,331
Your own certificate
should be enough,

634
00:58:07,402 --> 00:58:09,824
or mine and your mother's
at the very most.

635
00:58:09,898 --> 00:58:12,451
They want my grandparents' too
to be sure.

636
00:58:13,226 --> 00:58:15,812
Sure of what?

637
00:58:15,882 --> 00:58:17,671
My origins.

638
00:58:20,586 --> 00:58:21,928
Well, yes.

639
00:58:21,994 --> 00:58:25,027
l must prove l'm not a certain man
the police are looking for.

640
00:58:46,506 --> 00:58:49,450
How long have they given you?

641
00:58:51,595 --> 00:58:53,002
Two weeks.

642
00:58:53,418 --> 00:58:55,556
That's quite enough.

643
00:58:56,458 --> 00:59:00,320
lt all sounds very strange.

644
00:59:01,578 --> 00:59:03,945
Are you sure there isn't
something more behind it?

645
00:59:05,035 --> 00:59:06,628
lt's just a formality.

646
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:08,554
There's no real doubt.

647
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:11,433
So why do they want the certificates?

648
00:59:13,546 --> 00:59:15,554
Because it's the law.

649
00:59:18,400 --> 00:59:19,168
And also...

650
00:59:23,563 --> 00:59:26,360
because there's another Robert Klein.

651
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,672
And apparently he's a Jew.

652
00:59:29,898 --> 00:59:31,359
AJew?

653
00:59:32,202 --> 00:59:35,301
lmpossible!

654
00:59:37,834 --> 00:59:40,130
Or it could be the Dutch branch.

655
00:59:40,842 --> 00:59:42,598
Are there Kleins in Holland?

656
00:59:42,667 --> 00:59:45,300
Quite a different breed.

657
00:59:45,480 --> 00:59:46,688
- But we're related.
- l tell you,

658
00:59:47,530 --> 00:59:51,327
we've been French and Catholic
since Louis XlV!

659
00:59:59,947 --> 01:00:01,376
Yes, miss.

660
01:00:06,315 --> 01:00:08,224
Hello. Yes.

661
01:00:08,298 --> 01:00:09,378
What?

662
01:00:09,450 --> 01:00:10,563
No, l'm all right.

663
01:00:10,634 --> 01:00:13,384
Three of the certificates
are here in Strasbourg.

664
01:00:14,859 --> 01:00:16,615
But as for my maternal grandparents,

665
01:00:16,683 --> 01:00:19,203
one of them was born in Marseilles.

666
01:00:19,850 --> 01:00:22,900
Jules Marcel Bleard.

667
01:00:23,562 --> 01:00:26,529
Yes, B-L-F-A-R-D. You got it?

668
01:00:26,602 --> 01:00:28,424
And my grandmother in Algiers.

669
01:00:29,546 --> 01:00:31,586
Yeah, Algeria.

670
01:00:31,658 --> 01:00:34,528
