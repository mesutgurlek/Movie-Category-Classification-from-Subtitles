00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,269
Comrade Bai

176
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,032
Bai reports to the Captain

177
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,038
Telegraph HQ to verify

178
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:38,751
Yes

179
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,438
I've also brought food for you

180
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:42,432
- Food?
- There

181
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,829
Bravo!

182
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,357
Open the gate

183
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,789
Here comes Lord Hawk

184
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,913
Lower the palanquin

185
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,191
Without my order

186
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,431
how dare you go downhill?.

187
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:40,075
37 of you went out

188
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,237
and only you two dogs return

189
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,032
We were ambushes by the PLA

190
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:47,197
And they had tanks

191
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,438
They had tanks

192
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:50,954
Lord Hawk

193
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:52,749
Lord Hawk

194
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,950
I smell something funny

195
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,359
One Word:

196
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,552
Not Honest

197
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,598
Lord Hawk, those are two words

198
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:03,675
Shut up

199
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:04,989
Big brother

200
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,951
Take a few msn downhill

201
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:09,839
and see if there's any PLA

202
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,313
Yes, Lord Hawk

203
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,551
As for you two-

204
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,235
Go peck them!.

205
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,075
Bro 7

206
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:30,714
how does one become Lord Hawk?

207
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:32,628
You can't

208
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,432
Above all the bandits in the world

209
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,950
The Hawk is unparalleled

210
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,039
Comrade Bai

211
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:02,679
Ever shot a gun befure?.

212
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,871
What do you mean, a match?

213
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,752
No, just asking

214
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,272
Why's your frostbite bandaged Iike this?.

215
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,511
- Who did it?.
- 203

216
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,353
He bandaged all our feet

217
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:25,113
This Yang doesn't behave like a scout

218
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:26,839
So sloppy

219
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,077
How can he fight playing like this?.

220
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,589
Reporting to 203

221
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,028
HQ has replied

222
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,555
Saying what?.

223
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:37,671
Yang knows the area,
is an experiences investigator

224
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:39,433
Bai, the nurse

225
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,999
has been trained in battlefield rescue

226
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,549
Now, the area is grim and complicated

227
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,108
The two are sent to help

228
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:46,673
If there's a problem,

229
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,709
solve it yourself

230
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,434
Yang

231
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,148
Sing one more

232
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:00,633
What is it?.

233
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:20,432
- See anything?
- No

234
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:43,157
I've got you, get out!

235
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:45,277
- A child
- A child?.

236
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,033
From the village?

237
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,833
Bring him back

238
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,039
The wound is inflamed

239
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,916
- It's very serious
- Gunshot

240
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,276
- Anaesthetic?.
- Serious shortags

241
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,999
No

242
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,239
Little brother, be strong

243
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,349
Don't struggle

244
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,068
Hold on-

245
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:07,237
It's almost done, hold on

246
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,358
It's wrapped, Iet him go

247
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,719
Eat something

248
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:17,879
- Tank
- Tank

249
00:18:17,920 --> 00:18:18,955
What are you doing?

250
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,917
He'll freeze if he runs out

251
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,797
This boy thinks we're bandits

252
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,638
Lord Hawk grabbed this secret arsenal

253
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,990
from the Japanese

254
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,429
Nobody knows how much

255
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:10,431
ammunition the Tiger Fortress has

256
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,199
I tell you, Commissioner Hou

257
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,798
They have 3,000 guns

258
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,633
1 0 mortars

259
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,353
1 0 heavy machine guns

260
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,431
50 Iight machine guns

261
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:32,595
Lord Hawk

262
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:34,751
KMT ans the PLA are fighting

263
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,951
KMT wants to incorporate us

264
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:40,436
We've opened quite a can of worms

265
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:58,838
Bro 3 fought PLA with the Japs

266
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,592
Among all the bandits in the nine mountains

267
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,232
only he knows how to operate

268
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,872
this iron tortoise

269
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,431
Commissioner Hou, with this thing

270
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,153
is the other ringleader, Big Stick

271
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,111
even qualified to be No. 1?.

272
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,269
Commissioner Hou,

273
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,197
you represent the government to bestow

274
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,231
the commander of the Northeast advance troop

275
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:17,675
I can say this-

276
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:18,988
other than Lord Hawk,

277
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,599
nobody dares to take the position

278
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,958
Let's be frank-

279
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:25,516
If your gang submits to us

280
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,438
your respectable Hawk

281
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,592
will surely be the Commander of the advance troop

282
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,314
As for the Advance Map,

283
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,909
I will, of courss, offer it to him

284
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,599
Well sais

285
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:44,755
Lord Hawk, you will be the Commander

286
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:46,155
That depends on whether Hou

287
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,714
wants to give us the Advance Map

288
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:49,796
What map?.

289
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,519
Advance Map

290
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,434
One Word:

291
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:58,078
Getting the Map depends on whether
our force is strong enough

292
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:04,119
Hawk

293
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,072
seems to have a powerful army

294
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,112
But isn't a candidate for the Advance Map

295
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,872
Commissioner Hou, what do you mean?

296
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:12,919
The Hawk is bent on

297
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,678
becoming the biggest warlord in the Northeast

298
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,115
If he gets the Map,

299
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,718
he'Il be a major concern

300
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,553
So the Commissioner means...

301
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,313
The Advance Map

302
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,198
should be given to Big Stick

303
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:26,994
Smart boy

304
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,795
Let the two gangs fight each other,

305
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,435
and we'll gathsr the spoils

306
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,875
Yesterday we ambushed the Tiger gang

307
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,593
Hawk must be infuriated

308
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,718
If a large contingent of troops comes

309
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,440
villagers will be hurt when the fighting starts

310
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,398
The next stop is Leather Creek

311
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,159
Before the bandits come downhill

312
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,519
we must settle the villagers

313
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,315
Hongyi and Tank are locals

314
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:52,995
They will enter Leather Creek

315
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,110
as village people and check out the situation

316
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,039
Bring Yang

317
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,550
and also... that...

318
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,637
- that...
- Lil' Dove

319
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,714
Lil' Dove?.

320
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,188
We all call her that

321
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,919
Comrade Bai

322
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,193
They don't look like soldiers

323
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,869
If they go, it's easier to hide our identity

324
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,269
Stop knocking

325
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,355
Nobody's inside

326
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,029
No food, just my life

327
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,316
Take it if you can

328
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:14,713
Nothing left

329
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,672
Give them anything

330
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,509
Mother

331
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,596
Mother

332
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:22,834
Auntie

333
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,876
Fsllow villager-

334
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:25,995
Don't be afraid

335
00:23:26,120 --> 00:23:27,712
we are not bandits

336
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:31,309
Yongqi, It's me

337
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,352
Tank and I are back

338
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:36,431
- Hongyi
- Yongqi

339
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,314
Tank

340
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,154
give me a hand

341
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,799
help the old lady lie down

342
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,711
- Mother
- Let me see

343
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,119
She is a health officer

344
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,913
the same as a doctor

345
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,439
The lass is a doctor

346
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:53,630
Yongqi

347
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,876
What happened to my aunt?

348
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,713
It's my fault

349
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,077
Couldn't find food for her

350
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,229
Come

351
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,429
Auntie

352
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,195
Yongqi

353
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,231
What happened in Leather Creek?

354
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,039
What happened?

355
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,918
After the Japs surrendered,

356
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:37,038
the bandits kept coming to loot our village

357
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:38,635
We fought them

358
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,079
with fewer and fewer men

359
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,639
They took all our food

360
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:44,072
How can we go on?

361
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,793
Your brother and sister-in-Iaw

362
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:48,798
and Tank's family

363
00:24:49,160 --> 00:24:50,593
were also...

364
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,794
My boy

365
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,919
In the village

366
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,635
there are bandit spies

367
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,234
Who?

368
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,033
Couldn't find out

369
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:17,716
Reporting to 203

370
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:19,079
at your order, our men

371
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:20,348
are in villager clothes

372
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:21,913
to disguise our identity

373
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,275
Reporting to HQ

374
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:25,754
our troop stations at Leather Creek

375
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:32,230
203

376
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,508
the bandits are coming

377
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:34,630
Gao

378
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,238
Notify all troops: urgent assembly

379
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,392
Leather Creek's consition is unclear

380
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,709
We should hide ourselves

381
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:40,829
Protect the villagers in secret

382
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,514
Don't let the enemy discover us

383
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:43,835
Yes

384
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,598
Big brother, no sign of anything

385
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,837
No tank tracks, either

386
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,196
- Our spies?
- Yes, in the village

387
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:04,959
Tell them to report on any activity

388
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,070
Go back

389
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,315
Yes

390
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,230
North of the logging area are two huts

391
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,756
The slope behind the Creek

392
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,718
is susceptible to bandit attack

393
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,114
They are numerous

394
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:20,510
We need a defense line to fight against them

395
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,672
Ever heard of the indigenous cannons

396
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,551
made by the armored troop?

397
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,271
The Flying Thunder?. I know it

398
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:29,518
Put gunpowder in gasoline barrels

399
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:33,153
It's particularly powerful

400
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,116
Chaojia, you take Baojun and some soldiers

401
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,599
to look for gasoline barrels

402
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,950
Install them at crucial points in the village

403
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,915
Remember, this is our heavy weapon

404
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:44,635
Get ready for a fight

405
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:45,669
Yes

406
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,159
This is good stuff

407
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,953
Hard for me to find

408
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:05,071
Can't eat with your hands tied?

409
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,679
I can untie you, but

410
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,278
don't hit people again

411
00:27:21,040 --> 00:27:22,758
- He fled
- Come back

412
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,269
Shut up

413
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,148
You hear me?. Shut up

414
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,990
Freeze or I'll shoot you

415
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,959
Shut up

416
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,876
Lord Hawk sends you to monitor the PLA here

417
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,435
- There is no PLA
- That's right

418
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:53,551
He even asks me to look for tanks

419
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:55,029
Aide Luan

420
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,920
You left with Commissioner Hou

421
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:01,078
Why return to see Lord Hawk?.

422
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:02,953
I Have a map

423
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,958
Advance Map

424
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,797
Commissioner asked me to give it to Big Stick

425
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:10,878
But I'm just a messenger-

426
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,194
with nothing to gain

427
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,748
If I give it to Lord Hawk,

428
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,712
Not only do I get money,

429
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:18,355
but also a high position in the gang

430
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,956
- Agree?
- Yes

431
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,877
Brat! How dare you bite me?

432
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:26,758
I'll roast you!

433
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,679
Regiment 2, Detachment 2, PLA Private

434
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:51,119
Gao-

435
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,035
Tell me

436
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,111
Why are the PLA here?

437
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:56,673
How many of you?

438
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,759
Brat

439
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,514
So tight-lipped

440
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:04,110
All right, you'Il need some sweetener

441
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,875
Speak

442
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:27,794
No word and this Ieg will break

443
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,716
Thess ribs can be so tender

444
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:42,110
One struke will break several

445
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,950
Don't shoot, we can talk

446
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,231
Rest assured

447
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,918
What you heard in the hut

448
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:20,552
I've reported to 203

449
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,193
I'm tying up the splint

450
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:25,995
- Lil' Dove
- Be brave, act like a soldier

451
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:48,714
How do you feel?

452
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:50,790
- 203
- Don't move

453
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:51,909
Lie down

454
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,070
Reporting to 203

455
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,633
Ready to fight anytime

456
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,151
You eat, I eat

457
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:26,235
All right

458
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,631
You two each have a half

459
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:46,759
Tell me, what is your name?.

460
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:48,393
Where is your home?.

461
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,319
Knotti

462
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,715
It's okay

463
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,109
Knotti's Iast name is Jiang

464
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,912
He lived at Shalan Village

465
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,632
Six months ago, bandits killed his father

466
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,678
his mother Qinglian went missing

467
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,712
Knotti drifted about alonc, looking for relatives

468
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,513
He bore lots of hardships

469
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,679
His mother must've been abducted by the bandits

470
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,673
I hope she's still alive

471
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,632
so they can reunite

472
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,119
It's sweet sorghum, the house is full of it

473
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,309
So much food

474
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,598
Hongyi, now our village

475
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,358
has food for the winter

476
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,231
Hoarding so much food and ammunition

477
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:38,908
this must belong to the bandits'

478
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,951
connecting point in Leather Creek

479
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,391
I can't see through Yang

480
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:50,113
What is he doing here?

481
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,311
HQ must've ssnt him for a reason

482
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,069
203

483
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,793
Let's wait and see

484
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,039
Sir

485
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:01,311
I just scalp tobacco for food

486
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,750
A mere trifle

487
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,631
For a trifle you beat people up like that?

488
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:06,999
You goddamn liar

489
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,389
I thought he was a thief

490
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,112
Ever heard of Advance Map?.

491
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,228
No

492
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:15,235
Gao said

493
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,954
this guy wants to sell the Advance Map to Hawk

494
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:19,873
We must find the map

495
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,875
203

496
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,148
He'll confess if we beat it out of him

497
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,668
- This is for Gao
- Don't be impetuous

498
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,797
We need intelligence from him

499
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,759
Let me try

500
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,112
Aide Luan

501
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:53,799
You betrayed Commissioner Hou

502
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:56,235
He sent you to deliver something to Big Stick

503
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,715
and you turn to Hawk

504
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,832
Two gangs and Commissioner Hou
all in your pocket

505
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,718
Would Big Stick be cheated by a bastard like you?

506
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,873
Listen-

507
00:34:11,560 --> 00:34:14,518
he also conned KMT and PLA

508
00:34:15,920 --> 00:34:18,388
Big Stick joined PLA?.

509
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:21,236
You're confusing me

510
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,630
You can't fool anyone

511
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:27,198
Listen, he has words for you

512
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,875
You've got the Map, but going nowhere

513
00:34:30,160 --> 00:34:31,957
Hawk can't get it either

514
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:34,113
He also ordered

515
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:36,920
a grave for you at Leather Creek

516
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,029
Brother

517
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,753
your name?.

518
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,919
Call me...

519
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,874
Hu

520
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,350
This Yang, who is he?

521
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,630
He's Yang from Shandong

522
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:56,553
Mr. Hu

523
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,239
I'm Luan

524
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:00,032
Cut the crap

525
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:01,913
I've conveyed the message

526
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,991
Now I'll send you to hell

527
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:05,992
Wait, Mr. Hu

528
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,191
do ms a favor, please tell Lord Big Stick

529
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:10,430
the map is with me now

530
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,948
I'll always have it

531
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,274
I won't go to Hawk

532
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:14,992
It's a misunderstanding

533
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:21,434
It's such a big favor, how do I not do it?

534
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,632
I'll spare your Iife now

535
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:25,193
Let's wait and see

536
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:33,919
Advance Map

537
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,313
Report to HQ now

538
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,032
- Yes
- Go

539
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,228
Wait

540
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:50,918
There's one more scoop

541
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,955
Fsllow villagers-

542
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,675
Leather Creek wasn't afraid of the Japs,
why would it fear bandits?

543
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:01,513
As long as we raise our guns

544
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,272
the bandits dare not come

545
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,317
There's no way to fight them

546
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,313
Any village that fought the bandits

547
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,510
was wiped out

548
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,354
We can't fight the bandits

549
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,393
Why not?

550
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,749
Village chief

551
00:36:18,040 --> 00:36:19,996
this hard-earnes harvest can't be

552
00:36:20,040 --> 00:36:21,632
surrendered to the bandits for nothing

553
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:25,236
Mr. Soldier, after you leave

554
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,430
Leather Creek will again suffer a calamity

555
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:30,196
Hide those things right away

556
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:32,078
I beg you

557
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:33,912
I'll kneel before you

558
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,635
Spare our lives

559
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:40,110
We can't fight the bandits

560
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,593
Give me a gun

561
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,598
Give me a gun

562
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:51,636
- Give me a gun
- Kiddie-

563
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,559
- you"'re shorter than the gun
- Give me gun

564
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:55,750
- Stop shouting
- Give it to me

565
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,314
Give me gun, l'Il avenge

566
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,998
- my dad's death on the bandits
- Let go

567
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:00,913
Revenge is an adult business

568
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,269
You're still a kid

569
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,879
You just stay quietly at home

570
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,239
I Have no home

571
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,675
You have a home

572
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:08,711
All of us are your family

573
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,912
So when we go fight the bandits

574
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,838
you take care of the home

575
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,275
We surely will

576
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,878
find your mom for you

577
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:34,077
Report, HQ knows about the Advance Map

578
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,668
The Advance Map shows the distribution of

579
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,597
over 1 0,000 advance soldiers in the Northeast

580
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,631
203, this is the reply

581
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,551
Advance troops were the armed forces hiding

582
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,591
in the mountains during the war against Japan

583
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,114
The Japs drew 3 military maps

584
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,593
based on intelligence

585
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,035
The Japs deployed troops

586
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,399
in a futile attempt to control them

587
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,113
After the Japs surrendered,

588
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:57,674
their forces remained in the mountains

589
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:58,994
Each went their own way

590
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,588
Whoever gets the three maps now

591
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,710
can summon the advance troops

592
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,111
and become king of the Northeast

593
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,232
The first one is a Coordinate Map

594
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:10,829
The nine mountains, 18 mounds

595
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,154
1 3 gangs

596
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,952
outposts, contact points, and courdinates

597
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,514
are all Iaid out on this map

598
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,435
This Coordinate Map

599
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,676
is in the hands of our Lord Hawk

600
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,314
The second one is an Ammunition Map

601
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,357
When warlord Zhang was king of the Northeast

602
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,594
deep in the mountains and forests

603
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:29,119
he built two arsenals

604
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,759
storing uver 10,000 guns,

605
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,599
hundreds of cannons and countless ammunition

606
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,355
One of these two arsenals

607
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:37,953
is at Tiger Mountain

608
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,395
It was later taken by the Japs

609
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,000
And is now in Hawk's hands

610
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:47,392
Who would've thought there's an arsenal

611
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,438
What's the third map?

612
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:53,237
This third map is Warlord Zhang's...

613
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:57,159
Warlord Zhang's Treasure Map

614
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:59,031
- Lord Hawk
- Lord Hawk

615
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:06,434
Legend has it there's 80,000 pounds of gold

616
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,791
80,000 pounds?

617
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,793
Brothers-

618
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:13,389
with 80,000 pounds of gold

619
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:16,518
we can buy as much ammunition as we like

620
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,152
from the Japs and the Russians

621
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,593
We can command Peony River

622
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:21,959
seize the Northeast

623
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:23,829
Next stop

624
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,269
One Word:

625
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,197
get the Gold Map

626
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,435
Luan surely doesn't know

627
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,748
the value of this map

628
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,509
Otherwise he wouldn't have given it to Hawk

629
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,197
This will cause a fierce bandit battle

630
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:38,193
I fear the villagers

631
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,509
will suffer another disaster

632
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,879
Strike fast

633
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:42,269
Annihilate Hawk

634
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,639
then sliminate Big Stick

635
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,990
How do we fight? Tiger Mountain
has over 1,000 men

636
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:48,954
The war is raging

637
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:50,918
We're short on men

638
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:52,832
They can't support us

639
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,593
I Have an idea-

640
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,111
If bandits can impersonate us,

641
00:39:58,280 --> 00:40:01,033
We can send someone to impersonate them

642
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:02,673
and infiltrate their hideout

643
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:06,634
He finds the spot with the Ieast firepower,

644
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,996
and that'll be our breakthrough point

645
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:11,795
When it's time, we'Il coordinate from within

646
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,832
and wipe out Hawk in one blow

647
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,436
How do you gain the bandits' trust?.

648
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,632
As an enemy intelligence scout

649
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,673
I was sent undercover in Big Stick's
gang for a year

650
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,996
I stusied them thoroughly

651
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,275
203

652
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:33,078
I want to take on this mission

653
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,428
Captain-

654
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,114
Rejected

655
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:46,438
Then what is your plan?.

656
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,272
One way: mobilize the villagers

657
00:40:51,560 --> 00:40:52,834
to flee as far as they can

658
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,077
Another way: arm the villagers

659
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,599
and wait for reinforcement

660
00:40:57,360 --> 00:40:58,713
Both are too passive

661
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,394
Moreover, time is running out

662
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,352
The mountains will soon be snowed under

663
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:06,837
203, please consider my plan

664
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,200
You need to obey orders

665
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,515
All right-

666
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:13,959
Then I resign

667
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:15,675
Yang

668
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,838
I knew you'd do this

669
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:19,869
Okay

670
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,753
it's up to you

671
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,749
Disobey orders

672
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:35,718
Act with no permission and no discipline

673
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,038
You've approved my resignation

674
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,795
Now I ain't under you

675
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,958
I know you're used to acting alone

676
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:44,509
But this time is different

677
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,638
A minor mistake

678
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,313
will ruin it all

679
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:49,914
Think about it

680
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:52,318
You don't trust me

681
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,397
You can't go to Hawk empty-handed

682
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:05,717
This is Luan's Advance Map

683
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,320
- The real map?.
- A fake map won't fool Hawk

684
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:13,352
I made a copy and sent it to HQ

685
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:14,755
And-

686
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,029
according to Luan's confession

687
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,991
we drew this map of Tiger Mountain

688
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:22,714
Leggy

689
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:23,909
Yes

690
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,549
Yang

691
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:30,518
you are our anti-bandit squad

692
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:32,274
You must succeed

693
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,194
Don't fail us

694
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:36,039
Follow Yang into the mountains

695
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,397
- Keep us posted
- Yes

696
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:19,317
Leggy, let's split here

697
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:20,788
Okay

698
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:25,714
Beyond this mountain

699
00:44:25,880 --> 00:44:27,552
is Tiger Gang territory

700
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,310
From here

701
00:44:29,360 --> 00:44:31,396
go downhill a ways

702
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:32,714
there's Liu Village

703
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:34,394
You should hide there

704
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,789
When it's time

705
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,558
I'll meet you here

706
00:44:37,880 --> 00:44:38,835
Okay

707
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:40,599
Yang

708
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,514
Hide your message inside the bark

709
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:46,030
I'll check it every day

710
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:53,989
Yang-

711
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:56,316
be very careful from now on

712
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:57,554
Leggy

713
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,309
you know why 203 changed his mind?

714
00:45:02,200 --> 00:45:04,589
Perhaps he's decided already

715
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,197
and waiting for your confirmation

716
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:14,639
Take care

717
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,793
Remember this rock

718
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,036
I'll try my best to approach Hawk

719
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,993
to find out more and inform you ASAP

720
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:34,836
If you don't hear from me after 1 0 days

721
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,309
the mission may have failed and I've been killed

722
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:39,876
Remember, the bandits are very cunning

723
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:41,553
Guard against surprise attacks

724
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:43,392
Protect the villagers of Leather Creek

725
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,073
Protect Little Knotti

726
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,759
Yang

727
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,115
Who are you?.

728
00:49:24,720 --> 00:49:26,312
Speak of the devil-

729
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:28,399
Want milk?

730
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,994
Mother comes

731
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,038
Want her relatives?.

732
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:33,953
Here comes the kid's uncls

733
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:35,435
Who are you?.

734
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,829
I'm me

735
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,309
Point the gun down

736
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,079
It's uncocked

737
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,596
Carry the tiger, pull the horse

738
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,552
Open the gate

739
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,997
Bring the man in

740
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,676
"A cloud in the black Northwest sky"

741
00:50:32,120 --> 00:50:34,395
"A crow in a flock of phoenix"

742
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,352
"A house filled with heroes"

743
00:50:36,400 --> 00:50:39,039
"Who's the king and who are the fellows?. "

744
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:41,269
Your name

745
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:43,113
Last name Hu

746
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,795
Mr. Hu

747
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,037
which gang are you with?.

748
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:50,950
I belong to Lord Big Stick's gang

749
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:54,073
Aide Hu, in charge of horses

750
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,592
What's your assignment here?.

751
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,835
I won't say 'til I see the boss

752
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:25,995
Big brothers-

753
00:51:26,040 --> 00:51:29,077
I just arrived, please bear with me

754
00:51:29,960 --> 00:51:31,757
"Our master Iords over tigsrs"

755
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:34,757
"Our pagoda seals river monsters"

756
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,512
What do you do?.

757
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,955
I belong to Lord Big Stick's gang

758
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,319
Why do you blush?.

759
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,752
I'm full of vigor

760
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,076
Why is it yellow now?

761
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,791
It's Wax against the cold

762
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,309
That said,

763
00:51:57,640 --> 00:52:00,074
you are under Commander Big Stick

764
00:52:18,080 --> 00:52:19,559
What identity will you fake?

765
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:23,436
Big Stick has a horse aide called Hu

766
00:52:23,800 --> 00:52:25,153
This man is seldom seen

767
00:52:25,200 --> 00:52:26,599
Nobody recognizes him

768
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:29,588
I can borrow his identity to meet Hawk

769
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:32,315
Big Stick and Hawk are arch-enemies

770
00:52:32,960 --> 00:52:34,552
Using this identity is suicidal

771
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,119
Exactly because of this,

772
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:38,749
Hawk will not verify

773
00:52:49,880 --> 00:52:51,791
Hu, horse aide of Lord Big Stick

774
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,114
pays respect to Lord Hawk

775
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:08,875
When...

776
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:11,549
did you know Commander Big Stick?

777
00:53:12,120 --> 00:53:14,111
When he was the Pulice Commissioner

778
00:53:14,200 --> 00:53:17,431
I've heard he has some favorite things

779
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,710
Two treasures

780
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,950
- Which two?.
- Horse and sword

781
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:22,718
- What horse?.
- A blue-mane horse

782
00:53:22,760 --> 00:53:24,239
- What sword?.
- A Japanese saber

783
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,793
- Who's gift?
- The Japs Army

784
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:28,593
- Where?.
- At Peony River

785
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,313
Brother Hu-

786
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:37,232
your commander treatsd you well

787
00:53:37,600 --> 00:53:39,079
Why do you betray him?.

788
00:53:39,360 --> 00:53:42,158
If I am a traitor,

789
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,237
you can kill ms now

790
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:46,558
It's all Aide Luan's fault

791
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:49,075
He stole Lord Big Stick's Advance Map

792
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,675
and blamed the theft on me

793
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:55,079
Lord Hawk, give me some wine first

794
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,191
I eventually caught the guy

795
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:11,073
I asked him to take the map

796
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:12,913
and go back with me

797
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:15,954
Explain everything to Lord Big Stick

798
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:18,150
to his face

799
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:20,918
Guess What he said?

800
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,160
He said: going back means death

801
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,951
It'd be better to offer the map to the PLA

802
00:54:28,320 --> 00:54:31,118
We'd be made battalion or regiment commanders

803
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,796
I pretended to agree

804
00:54:35,280 --> 00:54:36,599
After he fell asleep

805
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,871
I stole the map

806
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:42,595
I plannes to take it back to the brigade

807
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,915
and explain everything to Lord Big Stick

808
00:54:45,320 --> 00:54:48,392
But Luan's remark alarmed me

809
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:51,190
Going back meant death

810
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,319
In the Peony River region

811
00:54:58,520 --> 00:55:01,592
I most admire you, Lord Hawk

812
00:55:01,920 --> 00:55:03,512
In for a penny, in for a pound

813
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:04,913
Taking advantage of the snowstorm

814
00:55:04,960 --> 00:55:06,109
I braved Tiger Mountain

815
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:08,037
hoping to join your gang

816
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:09,799
Liar

817
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:16,833
Bullshit

818
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:19,792
You think I'm a pig?

819
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:21,872
Making up such a story

820
00:55:23,800 --> 00:55:25,279
I know the rules

821
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:28,552
No gift, no joining the gang

822
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:35,429
Lord Hawk

823
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,319
the Advance Map of Peony River

824
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,674
Hu's gift

825
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:40,758
to Lord Hawk

826
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,151
- Any news about Yang?.
- Not yet

827
00:56:11,640 --> 00:56:13,119
- 203
- I'll take over the shift

828
00:56:13,320 --> 00:56:14,833
You get some rest

829
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:23,954
Captain

830
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,797
- I'm not hungry
- You drink it

831
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,553
It's just you and me. Stop tagging along

832
00:56:37,120 --> 00:56:39,236
Sister Lil' Dove said this is a mission

833
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,350
If you don't drink, l'Il fail

834
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,635
Sister also said

835
00:56:42,680 --> 00:56:44,989
Captain surely can't sleep afterwards

836
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:46,996
We even pinky swore

837
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:56,796
Okay, I'll drink it

838
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:04,159
Go

839
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:06,832
Knotti, come here

840
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:08,194
It's your turn

841
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:09,869
I'm telling yuu-

842
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,070
move again, and I'll cut you like a mangy dog

843
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:47,919
Lord Hawk said

844
00:57:48,320 --> 00:57:50,231
to reward Hu

845
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:53,318
with the 9th Warrior Attendant position

846
00:57:53,520 --> 00:57:57,195
Colonel of Security Brigade

847
00:57:57,320 --> 00:58:00,118
Congratulations to the 9th Chief

848
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:27,789
Big brother,

849
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,395
Bro 9 can do Northeast dance duet

850
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:50,035
Stop barking

851
00:58:50,120 --> 00:58:51,599
Can't you see it's your master?

852
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:52,675
Dogs

853
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:54,632
They're my pets

854
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,672
My house is next to yours

855
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:59,195
Come visit me anytime

856
00:59:24,080 --> 00:59:25,274
None of your business

857
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:26,753
Get out

858
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,919
Lord Hawk's woman

859
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:30,109
Don't touch

860
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:33,232
Ma'am, Ieave Bro 9 a life

861
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:35,599
Get Iost

862
00:59:43,760 --> 00:59:44,829
Bro 7,

863
00:59:44,880 --> 00:59:46,199
you get out too

864
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:48,756
Bro 9, be careful

865
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:09,236
Bro 7, Bro 9 is doomed

866
01:00:12,320 --> 01:00:13,958
Lord Hawk

867
01:00:14,560 --> 01:00:15,913
Let's go

868
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:31,835
Bro 9,

869
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:33,753
you're srunk

870
01:00:34,360 --> 01:00:35,713
Ma'am,

871
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:37,759
why are you here?

872
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,108
Don't call me ma'am,

873
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:41,919
sounds so old

874
01:00:42,440 --> 01:00:43,873
Call me Qinglian

875
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:45,509
Knotti's Iast name is Jiang

876
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,273
He lived at Shanlan forestry station

877
01:00:47,680 --> 01:00:49,796
His mother Qinglian went missing

878
01:00:51,840 --> 01:00:54,070
Bro 9, son't go

879
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,556
Ma'am, have you been here
for over half a year?

880
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:02,673
Why rush, Bro 9?

881
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,031
We need to respect seniority

882
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,228
Ma'am,

883
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,317
Iet me pour you some tea,

884
01:01:10,680 --> 01:01:11,829
roll you a cigarette

885
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,074
Bro 9

886
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:30,235
Who are you?.

887
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,873
How'd you know...

888
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:35,035
Knotti is fine,

889
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:36,639
he's taken care of

890
01:01:36,840 --> 01:01:38,592
He misses his mom every day

891
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,989
The boss sends his Iady to see me

892
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:58,632
Take me to him

893
01:01:59,880 --> 01:02:01,393
It's not the right time

894
01:02:02,200 --> 01:02:03,758
Maybe later

895
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:06,911
I'm so grateful

896
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,994
I await patronage from the lady

897
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:13,673
My honor

898
01:02:24,960 --> 01:02:25,790
Bro 9

899
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:28,400
- Are you all right?
- Thanks for the tip

900
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:30,351
You saved my life

901
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:32,592
We're brothers

902
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:34,757
You're still alive

903
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:35,915
Brilliant!

904
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,190
You know how many Iives were lost for her?

905
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:39,749
How did you do it?

906
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:41,358
Go out for a walk

907
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:54,635
Bro 9,

908
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,955
the firepower of Tiger Mountain

909
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:59,191
covers five mounts and nine bunkers

910
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:00,719
It's an impenetrable defense

911
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,955
Show me, open my eyes

912
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:04,510
On the upposite side

913
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:05,629
is the fortune rock

914
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:06,749
of Tiger Mountain,

915
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,028
the King's rock

916
01:03:08,240 --> 01:03:09,355
A brilliant man once foretold

917
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,994
it symbolizes Lord Hawk's throne

918
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,673
To the north of the King's rock,

919
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,358
there seem to be no defenses in place

920
01:03:15,600 --> 01:03:18,068
On the Eastern cliff there are
open and hidden arms

921
01:03:18,280 --> 01:03:19,838
Isn't the North overlooked?.

922
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,433
It isn't

923
01:03:21,680 --> 01:03:24,240
The Eagle Beak there is like a hanging lamp

924
01:03:24,560 --> 01:03:25,595
Look, Bro 9,

925
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:27,073
a valley, right in the middle

926
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,675
So what bastards can come up here?.

927
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,990
Only the heavenly soldiers can fly this way

928
01:03:36,120 --> 01:03:37,348
Lord Hawk,

929
01:03:37,960 --> 01:03:40,633
Hu joined us without being tested

930
01:03:40,880 --> 01:03:42,313
It isn't proper

931
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:44,717
After the Japs retreated,

932
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,598
a 2,000-man troop

933
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,678
was defeated by eight of us

934
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:50,679
How did we do it?.

935
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,872
Lord Hawk was astute and circumspect

936
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:55,071
You used spies

937
01:03:56,040 --> 01:03:57,359
Therefore,

938
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:59,837
I hate spies the most

939
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:35,554
Bro 9

940
01:04:35,600 --> 01:04:37,113
Stop barking, one of ours

941
01:04:37,600 --> 01:04:39,079
- Where are you going?
- I go pee

942
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,434
Me to

943
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,635
Bro 8, men aren't dogs

944
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,877
We can't treat them like dogs

945
01:04:46,080 --> 01:04:47,752
What's wrong?

946
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:49,678
I treet them well

947
01:04:49,880 --> 01:04:50,995
They're fed every day

948
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,393
They actually enjoy it

949
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,235
We can't live by bullying others

950
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:58,079
We have to be refined

951
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:00,118
Should hope for peaceful life

952
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:03,799
Peaceful life?.

953
01:05:04,120 --> 01:05:05,792
What is peaceful life?.

954
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:08,276
Brothers, fight the PLA!

955
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:09,759
Fight the PLA!

956
01:05:09,840 --> 01:05:12,229
Damn it, the PLA is here

957
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:14,636
Bro 9, grab your gun and kill the PLA

958
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:15,874
Go

959
01:05:19,400 --> 01:05:20,594
Damn,

960
01:05:20,680 --> 01:05:21,829
at least there's a company

961
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:23,074
Bro 9, Iook

962
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:31,877
Shit, aim precisely

963
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,678
What kind of marksmanship is that?.

964
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:35,034
Blind?.

965
01:05:36,280 --> 01:05:37,679
Bro 9, have some fun

966
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,159
He dares not shoot

967
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:44,633
Son of a bitch

968
01:05:45,960 --> 01:05:47,075
Bro 9

969
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,235
Brothers,

970
01:05:48,280 --> 01:05:50,714
fight hard and kill the PLA!

971
01:05:51,680 --> 01:05:52,795
Bro 9 is brilliant

972
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,034
Keep an eye on him

973
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:06,074
Bro 2

974
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:07,555
Stop

975
01:06:07,600 --> 01:06:08,510
Bro 9,

976
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:09,834
stop at unce!.

977
01:06:10,520 --> 01:06:12,238
Stop firing

978
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:17,994
Son of a bitch

979
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:21,955
Stop firing

980
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,395
Stop

981
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:26,230
Bro 9, this is a drill

982
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,596
Drill

983
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,198
They're our brothers

984
01:06:29,320 --> 01:06:30,833
Our brothers

985
01:06:32,280 --> 01:06:33,554
Damn you

986
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,079
Are you kidding me?

987
01:06:35,280 --> 01:06:36,429
A drill?.

988
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:39,114
Killing so many

989
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:43,634
Bro 2

990
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,313
The men are here...

991
01:06:46,560 --> 01:06:49,233
you might as well give them to me

992
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:50,634
I'II take them downhill

993
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,671
to practice looting

994
01:06:52,720 --> 01:06:54,790
Lord Hawk, What do you think?

995
01:06:54,840 --> 01:06:56,114
Tell Bro 5,

996
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:58,875
if Hu plays a trick on us,

997
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,832
bring back his corpse

998
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:02,274
Sure thing

999
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,318
- Bro 5, you lead the way
- Okay

1000
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:05,634
Brothers,

1001
01:07:05,680 --> 01:07:07,272
follow my orders

1002
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:09,397
We go downhill, we start Iooting

1003
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,671
This is a rotten idea of testing Hu

1004
01:07:16,680 --> 01:07:18,272
At least it proves Hu

1005
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:20,073
isn't a PLA spy

1006
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:21,999
One Word:

1007
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:26,072
Why weren't you down there, being blown up too?.

1008
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:32,315
Brothers,

1009
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:34,431
Iet's race to the oppusite slope

1010
01:07:34,680 --> 01:07:36,113
No. 1 gets $5

1011
01:07:36,360 --> 01:07:37,588
No. 2 gets $3

1012
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,113
No. 3 gets $1

1013
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:40,998
Charge!

1014
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:00,348
Bro 8,

1015
01:08:00,680 --> 01:08:01,954
I remember

1016
01:08:02,200 --> 01:08:03,679
there was a grove

1017
01:08:03,720 --> 01:08:05,233
When was it cut down?.

1018
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:06,995
Really?.

1019
01:08:07,040 --> 01:08:08,598
Maybe it's for the winter

1020
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:09,676
Before the snow'll seal off the mountain,

1021
01:08:09,720 --> 01:08:11,312
we must gather enough firewood

1022
01:08:11,600 --> 01:08:13,238
Lord Hawk forbids the felling of trees uphill

1023
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:15,669
So our brothers must have chopped these down

1024
01:08:16,400 --> 01:08:19,153
Clever, it's a shortcut

1025
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,117
Son of a bitch

1026
01:08:25,840 --> 01:08:27,114
My belly aches

1027
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:30,035
You wait here

1028
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,150
I'll find a place

1029
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,792
Mine aches, too

1030
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,751
You wait here, I'll go as well

1031
01:08:39,760 --> 01:08:40,988
What do you want?

1032
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,393
Let's follow

1033
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:57,199
I'd say...

1034
01:08:57,600 --> 01:08:59,079
watching me crap?.

1035
01:08:59,520 --> 01:09:01,272
That's new!.

1036
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,153
You got shit in there?.

1037
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,992
Then take a crap

1038
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:08,431
No shit?. Don't crap

1039
01:09:09,400 --> 01:09:11,197
And don't watch

1040
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:14,952
I'm talking to you

1041
01:09:18,600 --> 01:09:19,794
Idiots

1042
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,835
- Shit!
- Take a hike!.

1043
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,514
- Ignore him
- I can't crap with you here

1044
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:28,832
Never had to crap with live gunfire

1045
01:09:29,320 --> 01:09:31,754
Bro 5, is there a trick to it?.

1046
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:33,519
You wanna kill Bro 8, too?

1047
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,193
He's taking a crap, too

1048
01:09:37,320 --> 01:09:38,389
Bro 8,

1049
01:09:38,560 --> 01:09:39,834
brought any paper?.

1050
01:09:43,800 --> 01:09:45,074
Just pick it out

1051
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:47,713
I'm not used to thet

1052
01:09:48,160 --> 01:09:49,991
Forget it, I'll handle it myself

1053
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,519
What are you two up to?

1054
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:06,354
Interested in your dad's butt?.

1055
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,239
Like to watch?.

1056
01:10:08,280 --> 01:10:09,349
Don't you ever crap again

1057
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:10,959
Once you do it,

1058
01:10:11,000 --> 01:10:12,274
I'II shoot your butts

1059
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,673
Stop nagging

1060
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:16,394
- One more word I'll geld you
- What!.

1061
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,236
Nonsense

1062
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:19,840
Godsamn enjoyable

1063
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,797
They're after my butt

1064
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:23,639
Who's after your butt?

1065
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,079
You son of a bitch

1066
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,032
No respect for your elders

1067
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:28,872
We're all brothers

1068
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,359
Let's go

1069
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,273
Yang suggests that

1070
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:55,953
we go up Tiger Mountain's north cliff

1071
01:10:56,200 --> 01:10:57,599
and sneak attack the Tiger Fortress

1072
01:10:58,320 --> 01:10:59,639
On the map,

1073
01:10:59,680 --> 01:11:01,033
the north side of Tiger Fortress

1074
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,638
faces Eagle Beak

1075
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,279
Who's been to Eagle Beak?.

1076
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,112
I've heard of it, but never been there

1077
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:08,917
I've been there. I'll Iead the way

1078
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,993
You've been to Eagle Beak?

1079
01:11:13,120 --> 01:11:14,838
My dad used to take me

1080
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:16,313
I know how to get there

1081
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,437
But it's all precipices, can we manage?.

1082
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:19,959
If Yang suggests it,

1083
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:21,115
he knows

1084
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:23,038
I can go up there

1085
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:31,833
Knotti, let's go

1086
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,757
and prepare the skis

1087
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:36,355
- You know how to ski?.
- Who doesn't?

1088
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:37,879
Okay

1089
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:39,274
Go

1090
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:41,112
Chaojia, you take five men

1091
01:11:41,400 --> 01:11:43,118
and scout with Knotti at Eagle Beak

1092
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:44,309
Yes

1093
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:47,513
Knotti's mother Qinglian

1094
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,710
is on Tiger Mountain and she's fine

1095
01:11:55,680 --> 01:11:57,159
Don't tell Knotti

1096
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:00,998
Remember, we can't Iet him know

1097
01:12:03,680 --> 01:12:04,829
Knotti, follow me

1098
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:07,235
- Don't lag behind
- Try to catch up

1099
01:12:11,600 --> 01:12:12,589
Little Knotti,

1100
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:14,950
come closer and don't get lost

1101
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,874
Closer

1102
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:45,757
Knotti, slow down

1103
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:48,553
Catch up with him

1104
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:49,999
Don't lose him

1105
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:56,115
That's something, Knotti

1106
01:12:56,160 --> 01:12:57,275
You ski really fast

1107
01:12:57,320 --> 01:12:58,753
We should be your apprentices

1108
01:12:58,800 --> 01:12:59,755
What does that mean?.

1109
01:12:59,800 --> 01:13:01,028
Learn skiing from you

1110
01:13:01,080 --> 01:13:02,672
No problem, that's easy

1111
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:04,672
There's Eagle Beak

1112
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:10,429
Let's split up and check it out

1113
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,914
Go

1114
01:13:15,640 --> 01:13:18,234
Yang says upposite to Eagle Beak is

1115
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,998
the Northern cliff of Tiger Mountain

1116
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:23,637
But the cliff is too steep

1117
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:24,829
What?

1118
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,359
You bragged that

1119
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:27,959
nothing could stop you

1120
01:13:28,840 --> 01:13:30,034
You're cowering now?.

1121
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:35,428
I Have an idea

1122
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:27,278
You sing well, Lors Hawk

1123
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:40,316
Where is Knotti?.

1124
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:41,839
Take me to him

1125
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:44,429
Listen to me

1126
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:46,790
I found this in Hawk's coat

1127
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:48,792
This is Tiger Mountain's map of secret paths

1128
01:14:48,840 --> 01:14:50,910
We can escape with it

1129
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:53,992
If Hawk discovers it,

1130
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,439
no one can escape

1131
01:14:57,800 --> 01:14:58,835
Listen,

1132
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,916
put the map back immediately

1133
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:02,229
You should know

1134
01:15:02,280 --> 01:15:04,635
Tiger Mountain isn't a place you can escape from

1135
01:15:08,440 --> 01:15:09,634
Run now

1136
01:15:09,880 --> 01:15:12,440
Before he discovers it, we'll be gone

1137
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,956
Can't leave now

1138
01:15:20,680 --> 01:15:22,272
If you're not taking me away,

1139
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:23,873
why did you mention Knotti?

1140
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:25,439
Who are you?.

1141
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:28,352
You drank too much

1142
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:30,988
I'm just Bro 9 of Tiger Mountain

1143
01:15:31,040 --> 01:15:32,553
Cut the crap

1144
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:34,828
If I die,

1145
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,711
you can't shirk the responsibility

1146
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:38,555
You two...

1147
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:40,318
what responsibility?.

1148
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,919
As Bro 9,

1149
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:45,152
you should tell if you're leaving

1150
01:15:46,840 --> 01:15:48,990
Get out with your hands up

1151
01:15:51,320 --> 01:15:53,754
Later, insist the map is on him

1152
01:15:58,160 --> 01:15:59,388
Stand still

1153
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:00,795
Use your left hand

1154
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:02,678
to give me your gun

1155
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,069
Who shot?.

1156
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:20,872
Lord Hawk, it's me

1157
01:16:22,520 --> 01:16:24,272
I saw your lady trying to elope with Bro 9

1158
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:26,398
So I fired to alert you

1159
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:35,353
Really?.

1160
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:36,835
Lord Hawk,

1161
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:39,031
My conscience is clear

1162
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,278
Hang him up

1163
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,513
Tie him up

1164
01:17:32,280 --> 01:17:34,874
Later, insist that the map is on him

1165
01:17:36,120 --> 01:17:37,189
It's him

1166
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:40,038
I saw him steal from Lord Hawk's house

1167
01:17:40,280 --> 01:17:41,872
I asked Bro 9 to help me catch him

1168
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:43,514
Now he's faking a counter-charge

1169
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:44,754
A thief accusing thieves

1170
01:17:44,920 --> 01:17:45,909
You...

1171
01:17:45,960 --> 01:17:47,791
Lord Hawk

1172
01:17:47,920 --> 01:17:50,150
I didn't, I swear I didn't

1173
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:52,115
Confess

1174
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:54,515
Lord Hawk, I really didn't

1175
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:56,398
I kept an eye on your wife

1176
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,875
to see if she'd be disloyal to you

1177
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:01,355
That's very kind of you

1178
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,675
Lord Hawk, this is a misunderstanding

1179
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,068
Is he a thief, or not?

1180
01:18:08,360 --> 01:18:09,588
Search him and fins out

1181
01:18:09,640 --> 01:18:12,518
Lord Hawk, if I've done anything wrong,

1182
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,312
I'll shoot myself

1183
01:18:16,720 --> 01:18:18,119
Search

1184
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:42,989
This...

1185
01:18:43,040 --> 01:18:45,918
This really... isn't mine

1186
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,553
Use your left hand, and give me your gun

1187
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:58,517
Lord Hawk, it really isn't mine

1188
01:18:58,840 --> 01:19:00,956
- I'm being framed
- Of course it isn't yours

1189
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,073
It's mine

1190
01:19:04,920 --> 01:19:08,310
Lord Hawk, I'm being framed

1191
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:09,589
Big brother,

1192
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:12,512
you brought him here

1193
01:19:13,800 --> 01:19:15,074
Tell me...

1194
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,439
what should be done?.

1195
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:22,870
Big brother

1196
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:24,319
Don't, Big brother

1197
01:19:31,520 --> 01:19:32,873
Lord Hawk

1198
01:19:34,680 --> 01:19:36,113
See you in the next Iife

1199
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:39,669
Whoops

1200
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:43,074
Missed the target

1201
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:45,268
Lord Hawk,

1202
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,591
I'm Bro 4's guarantor

1203
01:19:49,040 --> 01:19:50,837
I should be punished

1204
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:53,353
No

1205
01:19:55,000 --> 01:19:56,353
Forget it

1206
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,595
Now you owe me your life

1207
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,955
You can pay me back later

1208
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:08,915
Lord Hawk

1209
01:20:09,320 --> 01:20:11,117
Lord Hawk

1210
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:14,119
Thank you, Lord Hawk

1211
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,628
Lord Hawk

1212
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:17,398
How about Bro 9?.

1213
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:22,756
- What's that?.
- Again

1214
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:23,550
What's that?

1215
01:20:23,600 --> 01:20:24,749
- Come on
- Don't move

1216
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:26,279
- Grab the tile
- Don't blame it on me

1217
01:20:26,800 --> 01:20:27,915
- It's all your fault
- My fault?.

1218
01:20:27,960 --> 01:20:29,029
I haven't won all night

1219
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:30,957
What tile did you give out?.

1220
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:32,948
My turn

1221
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,874
I win, Royal Flush, 148 points

1222
01:20:36,960 --> 01:20:39,713
- Pay up, everybosy pay up
- AIl the same suit

1223
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:41,755
- Pay up
- Paying

1224
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:42,869
- Lend me some money
- No

1225
01:20:43,040 --> 01:20:44,393
Bro 6, no way

1226
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:45,908
Bro 6, no way

1227
01:20:45,960 --> 01:20:47,518
You bastard, listen up

1228
01:20:47,560 --> 01:20:49,755
Loaning money to me is an honor, get it?.

1229
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:03,111
Can't pay your Iosses?.

1230
01:21:03,240 --> 01:21:05,674
Then don't play

1231
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,159
It's enough

1232
01:21:07,520 --> 01:21:09,875
The village spies've been silent

1233
01:21:09,920 --> 01:21:12,798
Lord Hawk

1234
01:21:12,920 --> 01:21:14,239
Big brother,

1235
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:15,794
the spies you sent

1236
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:17,398
are either Iiving in peace

1237
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:18,998
or were killed by the PLA

1238
01:21:20,160 --> 01:21:21,639
Tomorrow, take Bro 5, Bro 6

1239
01:21:21,680 --> 01:21:23,511
and 300 men downhill

1240
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,313
If PLA is really down there,

1241
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:27,232
treat it as an exercise

1242
01:21:27,440 --> 01:21:28,953
Before the snow seals off the mountain,

1243
01:21:29,000 --> 01:21:31,958
kill the sheep and come back for New Year

1244
01:21:32,200 --> 01:21:33,519
Yes, Lord Hawk

1245
01:21:42,760 --> 01:21:44,432
The bandits are coming

1246
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:46,558
The bandits are coming

1247
01:21:47,920 --> 01:21:49,194
How many of them? How far away?.

1248
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:50,309
Over 200 men

1249
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,668
About 2 miles from the village

1250
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:52,590
Tank

1251
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,232
Order all the units to get ready for combat

1252
01:21:54,280 --> 01:21:56,032
- Set up three defense lines
- Yes

1253
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,315
- Detonator
- Yes

1254
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,315
How about the FIying Thunder?.

1255
01:21:58,360 --> 01:21:59,634
Can detonate at any time

1256
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:00,590
Gao, tell Yongqi

1257
01:22:00,720 --> 01:22:02,836
to gather the villagers

1258
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,558
- Keep a close eye on Luan
- Yes

1259
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:05,795
Listen carefully,

1260
01:22:05,920 --> 01:22:07,148
move around when you fight,

1261
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:09,118
so that the enemy can't figure out our numbers

1262
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,758
Buddha of infinite light, please bless us

1263
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:19,835
Quit your racket

1264
01:23:19,880 --> 01:23:21,552
No use praying

1265
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:22,669
If you attract the bandits here,

1266
01:23:22,720 --> 01:23:24,153
we'll all die

1267
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:26,359
Little Knotti, don't be afraid

1268
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,989
We hid in a hut like this last time

1269
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:30,439
They all died

1270
01:23:30,760 --> 01:23:31,988
Everybody died

1271
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:33,189
I don't wanna die

1272
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:34,634
- I wanna gu home
- Don't make a noise

1273
01:23:34,840 --> 01:23:36,319
Don't worry, this time is different

1274
01:23:36,360 --> 01:23:38,032
This time, we're here

1275
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:20,989
Fire

1276
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:27,749
Fire

1277
01:24:31,960 --> 01:24:33,279
Damn it,

1278
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,038
they have cannons

1279
01:24:35,280 --> 01:24:36,838
Must be PLA's primary force

1280
01:24:37,080 --> 01:24:38,115
Follow me

1281
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:23,395
Shut up

1282
01:25:23,560 --> 01:25:24,595
you bastard

1283
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:26,437
You won't be rescued

1284
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:27,714
Stop dreaming

1285
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,114
Shut up

1286
01:25:31,080 --> 01:25:32,195
Charge

1287
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:41,308
Little Knotti, it's okay

1288
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:58,230
Knotti

1289
01:27:08,120 --> 01:27:09,394
Knotti

1290
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:11,353
Little Knotti

1291
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,873
Leggy

1292
01:27:41,560 --> 01:27:43,278
Leave the roof now

1293
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,034
Damn it

1294
01:28:17,200 --> 01:28:18,872
Damn it

1295
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:19,591
Big brother

1296
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:21,312
Someone's firing from the tower

1297
01:28:22,960 --> 01:28:24,393
- Load the gun
- Yes

1298
01:28:40,280 --> 01:28:41,872
Let me through

1299
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:43,430
Knotti

1300
01:28:43,680 --> 01:28:44,999
Stay here

1301
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:54,194
Knotti's gone out, let me out

1302
01:28:54,240 --> 01:28:55,514
Okay

1303
01:28:57,200 --> 01:28:58,428
Be careful

1304
01:29:10,320 --> 01:29:11,673
Get ready

1305
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:13,753
Wait

1306
01:29:14,160 --> 01:29:15,912
Who's there 1 00 feet ahead?.

1307
01:29:18,360 --> 01:29:20,351
They're in firing range

1308
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:21,875
The village chief

1309
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,558
Go away

1310
01:29:23,960 --> 01:29:25,029
Go

1311
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,671
- Hongyi
- Yes

1312
01:30:03,720 --> 01:30:04,835
The west side has fallen

1313
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:05,949
You must hold on

1314
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,069
Yes

1315
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,155
Knotti

1316
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:59,433
No more in the cartridge, go get it

1317
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:00,430
Yes

1318
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:20,635
Little Knotti

1319
01:31:20,680 --> 01:31:22,238
Stay here, don't move

1320
01:31:36,960 --> 01:31:38,359
Hold on

1321
01:31:46,920 --> 01:31:49,992
Give the bullets to Tank

1322
01:31:52,720 --> 01:31:55,598
Give the bullets to Tank

1323
01:32:02,880 --> 01:32:04,029
Knotti

1324
01:32:17,440 --> 01:32:18,589
Brick

1325
01:32:18,960 --> 01:32:19,870
Brick

1326
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:24,068
Brick

1327
01:32:26,720 --> 01:32:28,278
He said to give Tank the bullets

1328
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,155
Knotti

1329
01:32:34,280 --> 01:32:35,110
Knotti

1330
01:32:46,160 --> 01:32:47,434
Ready for a match?

1331
01:32:47,680 --> 01:32:49,113
I'll go distract them

1332
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,796
Don't move or I'll shuot you

1333
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:01,674
Knotti

1334
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:09,828
Ammunition box

1335
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:40,108
Bro 6

1336
01:36:40,640 --> 01:36:42,278
Big brother

1337
01:36:42,920 --> 01:36:44,069
Bro 6

1338
01:36:44,200 --> 01:36:45,155
Where is Bro 5?

1339
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,435
Haven't seen him

1340
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:48,119
Guess he's fled

1341
01:36:49,080 --> 01:36:50,115
Don't hesitate, Big brother

1342
01:36:50,160 --> 01:36:51,718
Iet's withdraw

1343
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:53,868
Withdraw

1344
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,438
Brick...

1345
01:37:34,120 --> 01:37:35,314
The others?.

1346
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:37,109
Auger, Xiaoliang

1347
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:38,315
Wheel and Steel Wrist

1348
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:39,759
are all injured

1349
01:37:42,040 --> 01:37:43,155
And...

1350
01:38:08,160 --> 01:38:09,593
203

1351
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:30,795
Captain

1352
01:38:31,520 --> 01:38:32,953
It's all my fault

1353
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:34,919
I'm useless

1354
01:38:35,320 --> 01:38:36,719
I Iet that bastard Luan

1355
01:38:37,000 --> 01:38:38,353
slip away

1356
01:38:39,120 --> 01:38:40,712
Leggy, let's chase

1357
01:38:40,760 --> 01:38:41,636
Chase Who?

1358
01:38:41,800 --> 01:38:42,949
Luan

1359
01:39:03,560 --> 01:39:05,152
If we can't find Luan

1360
01:39:08,680 --> 01:39:10,318
Yang will be in danger

1361
01:39:33,320 --> 01:39:35,038
Bro 9, Iook

1362
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:37,351
your ols pal is here

1363
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,390
Aren't you Brother Luan?

1364
01:39:59,200 --> 01:40:01,236
When did you come to Tiger Mountain?

1365
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:02,833
It's you?.

1366
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:04,639
It's me

1367
01:40:04,960 --> 01:40:06,439
Hu

1368
01:40:07,280 --> 01:40:09,191
What's going on, brother?

1369
01:40:09,840 --> 01:40:11,956
Last month we're at Leather Creek

1370
01:40:12,000 --> 01:40:14,673
trying to decide which gang to join

1371
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,597
You dragged me to the PLA

1372
01:40:16,840 --> 01:40:18,398
Only a short while later

1373
01:40:18,680 --> 01:40:20,671
you're wearing the PLA uniform

1374
01:40:20,920 --> 01:40:23,957
Are you a regiment or battalion commander now?

1375
01:40:25,560 --> 01:40:26,834
Hu

1376
01:40:27,320 --> 01:40:28,355
You've all been duped

1377
01:40:28,400 --> 01:40:29,435
Lord Hawk

1378
01:40:29,960 --> 01:40:32,269
he's a PLA spy

1379
01:40:42,640 --> 01:40:44,119
Bullshit

1380
01:40:47,320 --> 01:40:49,788
You say our Bro 9

1381
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:52,030
is a PLA spy

1382
01:40:53,600 --> 01:40:54,919
Brother Luan

1383
01:40:56,320 --> 01:40:58,880
that's a vicious thing to say

1384
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:03,188
You calles me a PLA spy

1385
01:41:04,640 --> 01:41:07,313
Don't forget, it was you who asked me to join

1386
01:41:07,720 --> 01:41:10,757
Now you're giving me this shitty unfair label

1387
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:13,036
Wanna Iend Lord Hawk a knife to kill me

1388
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:15,230
- You're lying
- Did the PLA send you?.

1389
01:41:16,080 --> 01:41:18,036
Lord Hawk and all big brothers

1390
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:20,237
Let this bastard explain

1391
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:22,556
how he knows I'm a PLA spy

1392
01:41:22,760 --> 01:41:24,876
and how he he's so familiar with the PLA

1393
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:27,315
You killed my brother at Leather Creek

1394
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:28,873
You stole my things

1395
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:31,150
Lord Hawk, the fur coat he's wearing

1396
01:41:31,360 --> 01:41:33,430
was originally my gift for you

1397
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:35,710
Luan

1398
01:41:35,920 --> 01:41:38,673
if you were captured by the PLA,

1399
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:41,390
How'd you get back here so quickly?.

1400
01:41:41,600 --> 01:41:43,556
Why are you wearing a PLA uniform?.

1401
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:47,392
Did the goddamned PLA send you to Tiger Mountain?

1402
01:41:49,400 --> 01:41:52,915
I'm wearing this to evade

1403
01:41:53,520 --> 01:41:55,238
the PLA spies

1404
01:41:55,640 --> 01:41:56,709
Lord Hawk

1405
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:02,830
How many PLA solsiers are down there?

1406
01:42:04,520 --> 01:42:05,748
20, no-

1407
01:42:07,120 --> 01:42:08,314
30

1408
01:42:08,760 --> 01:42:10,751
Bullshit

1409
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:13,236
30 msn, equipped with cannons?

1410
01:42:13,680 --> 01:42:15,796
When did Leather Creek get cannons?.

1411
01:42:18,080 --> 01:42:19,274
Lord Hawk

1412
01:42:20,080 --> 01:42:22,548
I think the PLA at least have
a regiment down there

1413
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:25,115
How else could they kill so many?

1414
01:42:25,160 --> 01:42:27,549
Lord Hawk, they really only have 30

1415
01:42:27,600 --> 01:42:28,715
That means only

1416
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,553
30 PLA soldiers

1417
01:42:30,920 --> 01:42:33,514
were able to reduce 300 of our men

1418
01:42:33,760 --> 01:42:36,035
to fewer than 50

1419
01:42:36,560 --> 01:42:38,357
And killed Bro 5, too

1420
01:42:40,280 --> 01:42:41,713
Bullshit

1421
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:48,993
Luan, it's damn strange that you're suddenly here

1422
01:42:49,400 --> 01:42:52,870
Tell me why or I'll shoot you

1423
01:42:53,200 --> 01:42:54,269
Say it

1424
01:42:54,920 --> 01:42:56,638
Big brothers-

1425
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:57,671
Today

1426
01:42:57,720 --> 01:43:00,996
Today, every word I say is true

1427
01:43:01,160 --> 01:43:03,355
I swear to god

1428
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:10,429
Lord Hawk

1429
01:43:10,960 --> 01:43:11,915
Lord Hawk

1430
01:43:12,320 --> 01:43:14,629
To offer tributs, I offended this mad dog

1431
01:43:15,280 --> 01:43:18,113
If I don't have my revenge, I'm less than a man

1432
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:20,233
Today, at Tiger Mountain

1433
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,550
either he lives or I live

1434
01:43:23,040 --> 01:43:24,632
If I'm a PLA spy

1435
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:26,239
you can kill ms right now

1436
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,312
Whether I'm an outsider or your man

1437
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:29,879
you decide

1438
01:43:35,040 --> 01:43:35,950
Lord Hawk

1439
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:37,758
there's no problem with Bro 9

1440
01:43:38,000 --> 01:43:39,956
He really is PLA

1441
01:43:40,120 --> 01:43:42,839
I did run away from Leather Creek, Lord Hawk

1442
01:43:42,880 --> 01:43:44,438
Whether he's Iying or not

1443
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:46,039
I know the answer

1444
01:43:47,360 --> 01:43:50,158
Today you come to join our gang

1445
01:43:50,600 --> 01:43:52,113
you must have a gift

1446
01:43:52,840 --> 01:43:56,071
Lord Hawk, everything

1447
01:43:56,640 --> 01:43:58,915
has stolen by the PLA

1448
01:44:00,200 --> 01:44:03,351
Did he snatch this?.

1449
01:44:04,560 --> 01:44:05,515
Lord...

1450
01:44:06,360 --> 01:44:07,634
Lord Hawk

1451
01:44:08,320 --> 01:44:09,435
This map, Lord Hawk

1452
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:12,080
he took it from me

1453
01:44:12,840 --> 01:44:14,353
It's him

1454
01:44:16,240 --> 01:44:18,037
What a mess

1455
01:44:18,160 --> 01:44:19,559
It's getting more confusing

1456
01:44:19,720 --> 01:44:21,039
Who do I listen to?

1457
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:25,868
I'd rather Ieave it to you

1458
01:44:48,400 --> 01:44:49,435
Lord Hawk

1459
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:50,919
don't shoot, Lord Hawk

1460
01:44:51,320 --> 01:44:52,753
I know you don't believe me

1461
01:44:52,920 --> 01:44:54,433
But if you go check out Leather Creek

1462
01:44:54,600 --> 01:44:57,194
you'll know it's a PLA trap

1463
01:44:57,240 --> 01:45:00,516
Big brother, it seems you have to go again

1464
01:45:04,240 --> 01:45:05,593
Damn you

1465
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:07,910
I just got ambushed at Leather Creek

1466
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:09,638
You ask me to go again

1467
01:45:09,800 --> 01:45:12,155
You want all my brothers killed?.

1468
01:45:12,200 --> 01:45:13,394
Don't hit

1469
01:45:14,720 --> 01:45:16,392
Lord... Lord Hawk

1470
01:45:17,320 --> 01:45:18,992
Truly, there's only 30 PLA soldiers

1471
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:20,268
Kill him!

1472
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:24,239
I know Leather Creek well

1473
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:28,633
Now, while they're still recuperating,

1474
01:45:28,880 --> 01:45:30,154
I'll take you to wipe them out

1475
01:45:30,200 --> 01:45:31,189
Bro 9

1476
01:45:35,200 --> 01:45:37,839
Your gun, your mission

1477
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:42,555
Lord Hawk, entrust it to me

1478
01:45:42,600 --> 01:45:44,989
Every word I say is true

1479
01:45:45,160 --> 01:45:46,798
And you wanna kill me

1480
01:46:06,760 --> 01:46:09,194
I've Iied all my life

1481
01:46:09,520 --> 01:46:12,080
Speak to a saint like a saint,
a devil like a devil

1482
01:46:12,320 --> 01:46:14,515
I've been safe and gained wealth

1483
01:46:15,120 --> 01:46:17,839
I didn't expect the first time I tell the truth

1484
01:46:18,600 --> 01:46:20,955
I'd die in the hands of a liar

1485
01:46:21,720 --> 01:46:23,233
No use saying that now

1486
01:46:54,280 --> 01:46:55,872
Let's go, Bro 2

1487
01:47:19,040 --> 01:47:20,758
203, urgent intelligence

1488
01:47:20,920 --> 01:47:22,831
Luan is killed by Yang

1489
01:47:24,680 --> 01:47:25,715
On New Year's Eve

1490
01:47:25,920 --> 01:47:28,070
A banquet will be held at Tiger Hall

1491
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:29,754
At 1 a.m.

1492
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,950
I'II blow up the west wall to welcome you

1493
01:47:36,000 --> 01:47:37,194
Gao

1494
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:39,119
Brick

1495
01:47:40,840 --> 01:47:42,956
you two stay at Leather Creek

1496
01:47:48,440 --> 01:47:50,032
Salute the two

1497
01:47:50,720 --> 01:47:51,835
comrades in arms

1498
01:48:21,040 --> 01:48:23,429
I know you don't want me to go with you

1499
01:48:24,000 --> 01:48:25,513
You've never treated me as a soldier

1500
01:48:25,760 --> 01:48:26,795
No

1501
01:48:27,120 --> 01:48:29,429
you've taken good care of the warriors

1502
01:48:30,000 --> 01:48:31,194
They're grateful to you

1503
01:48:31,520 --> 01:48:32,794
But for the Tiger Mountain battle

1504
01:48:33,000 --> 01:48:34,718
- in case we...
- And you're the soldier?.

1505
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:36,559
What's the duty of a soldier?

1506
01:48:38,840 --> 01:48:40,398
To protect himself?.

1507
01:48:41,000 --> 01:48:41,955
Liars

1508
01:48:42,000 --> 01:48:43,797
My mom and dad are dead

1509
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:45,034
Brother Gao died

1510
01:48:45,080 --> 01:48:47,036
Which of you protected thsm?.

1511
01:48:50,200 --> 01:48:54,034
I'm telling yuu, Gao died protecting us

1512
01:48:54,280 --> 01:48:56,396
What you're saying isn't fair

1513
01:48:56,680 --> 01:48:58,989
Your mom and dad sacrificed for you

1514
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:00,753
Have you gone crazy?

1515
01:49:09,320 --> 01:49:11,629
- Get up
- Get up for what?.

1516
01:49:12,760 --> 01:49:13,875
Knotti

1517
01:49:14,160 --> 01:49:16,799
Listen to me, your mom is still alive

1518
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:18,913
Yang sent word

1519
01:49:19,360 --> 01:49:20,918
your mom is on Tiger Mountain

1520
01:49:26,360 --> 01:49:27,713
Knotti

1521
01:49:28,440 --> 01:49:30,590
she's still alive, do you hear me?.

1522
01:49:31,560 --> 01:49:32,879
She's still alive

1523
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:34,399
Understand?.

1524
01:49:36,920 --> 01:49:38,148
Still alive...

1525
01:49:38,600 --> 01:49:39,635
Tank

1526
01:49:39,840 --> 01:49:41,831
the villagers want to see the Captain

1527
01:49:47,200 --> 01:49:48,315
Captain

1528
01:49:48,600 --> 01:49:49,749
The villagers heard that

1529
01:49:49,800 --> 01:49:51,552
you're attacking Tiger Mountain tonight

1530
01:49:51,920 --> 01:49:54,195
Today is Lunar New Year's Eve

1531
01:49:54,440 --> 01:49:56,510
They want to treat all of you

1532
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,518
to a New Year's Eve family dinner

1533
01:49:59,000 --> 01:50:00,149
A snowstorm is coming

1534
01:50:00,520 --> 01:50:02,750
We have to arrive at Eagle Beak before dark

1535
01:50:03,040 --> 01:50:04,234
Every minute counts

1536
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,872
We'll have family dinner when we return

1537
01:50:10,120 --> 01:50:11,314
Fsllow villagers-

1538
01:50:11,800 --> 01:50:12,994
thank you

1539
01:50:14,160 --> 01:50:15,912
- Get ready to set off
- Yes

1540
01:50:23,040 --> 01:50:25,270
Don't go, I'll go so I can find my mom

1541
01:50:26,040 --> 01:50:27,268
Lil' Juan

1542
01:50:27,640 --> 01:50:29,756
what are you doing?. Come here

1543
01:50:33,440 --> 01:50:34,395
Knotti

1544
01:50:34,600 --> 01:50:36,989
At Tiger Mountain, you can only wait outside

1545
01:50:37,240 --> 01:50:38,912
- This is an order
- Okay

1546
01:50:45,960 --> 01:50:48,076
Lil' Dove, Knotti is entrusted to you

1547
01:51:59,320 --> 01:52:02,676
Light the lanterns

1548
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:10,750
"Boundless longevity"

1549
01:52:49,320 --> 01:52:52,630
Here enters the birthday star, the invincible

1550
01:52:52,720 --> 01:52:54,756
Lord Hawk

1551
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:10,717
Would the birthday star take his seat

1552
01:53:11,040 --> 01:53:12,837
The birthday banquet begins now

1553
01:53:42,200 --> 01:53:44,077
Serve the food and wine

1554
01:53:53,960 --> 01:53:59,273
Lord Hawk

1555
01:54:30,080 --> 01:54:32,753
Elders and brothers-

1556
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:35,272
today is the 60th birthday

1557
01:54:35,320 --> 01:54:37,276
of our Lord Hawk

1558
01:54:37,680 --> 01:54:39,432
and also New Year's Eve

1559
01:54:39,680 --> 01:54:41,557
A double blessing has descendes upon us

1560
01:54:42,360 --> 01:54:45,033
A family of 1,000 members, ruled by one man

1561
01:54:45,640 --> 01:54:47,915
Our gang is large and prosperous

1562
01:54:48,240 --> 01:54:50,993
thanks to boss' leadership

1563
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:54,278
Come, raise your glasses

1564
01:54:56,720 --> 01:54:58,870
Let's all wish our boss

1565
01:54:59,240 --> 01:55:00,639
a happy birthday

1566
01:55:00,760 --> 01:55:02,352
and many more to come

1567
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:03,999
Bottoms up

1568
01:55:04,720 --> 01:55:06,676
Get out of the way

1569
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,949
Lord Hawk

1570
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,195
Some of our brothers

1571
01:55:09,240 --> 01:55:10,958
saw the lady run towards

1572
01:55:11,000 --> 01:55:12,115
the Northwest corner on a horse

1573
01:55:12,160 --> 01:55:13,832
We've brought her back

1574
01:57:13,800 --> 01:57:15,358
Grab your guns, quick

1575
01:57:28,120 --> 01:57:29,394
What?

1576
01:57:38,080 --> 01:57:39,115
What?

1577
01:58:07,560 --> 01:58:09,039
Charge

1578
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:25,072
Get out of the way, quick

1579
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,510
Lord Hawk, the arsenal's been robbed

1580
01:58:27,760 --> 01:58:29,751
We're under siege

1581
01:58:29,880 --> 01:58:31,074
Hawk

1582
01:58:31,320 --> 01:58:33,072
retribution comes to all, eventually

1583
01:59:23,160 --> 01:59:24,752
Catch the traitor

1584
01:59:24,960 --> 01:59:27,872
This traitor must've come from outside

1585
01:59:27,920 --> 01:59:29,239
Hands up

1586
01:59:29,640 --> 01:59:31,358
You're the only outsider here

1587
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:34,559
They're my brothers in arms

1588
01:59:42,680 --> 01:59:44,716
I suspected one day

1589
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:47,635
Tiger Mountain would be infiltrated

1590
01:59:48,160 --> 01:59:50,276
But before you succeed

1591
01:59:50,920 --> 01:59:52,797
my role to play

1592
01:59:54,640 --> 01:59:56,039
is to kill you

1593
02:02:25,240 --> 02:02:26,309
Big brother

1594
02:02:26,760 --> 02:02:28,159
I spared your life

1595
02:02:28,320 --> 02:02:30,151
today you should repay me

1596
02:02:30,320 --> 02:02:31,435
Shield me when I flee

1597
02:02:31,520 --> 02:02:32,873
Yes, Lord Hawk

1598
02:03:53,240 --> 02:03:54,434
Hawk has fles

1599
02:03:54,680 --> 02:03:56,113
Disarm and surrender

1600
02:03:57,920 --> 02:03:59,239
Freeze

1601
02:04:04,640 --> 02:04:05,789
Stop resisting

1602
02:04:05,840 --> 02:04:07,239
Disarm and we Won't kill you

1603
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:14,159
Hands up

1604
02:04:55,360 --> 02:04:56,998
We're the PLA

1605
02:04:57,240 --> 02:04:58,912
Drop your weapons and we won't kill you

1606
02:05:06,640 --> 02:05:08,790
Bro 9

1607
02:05:38,880 --> 02:05:40,313
Put down your guns

1608
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:45,155
- Put down your guns
- Don't

1609
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:47,351
Baojun, ignore me

1610
02:05:47,960 --> 02:05:49,359
I'II say it once more

1611
02:05:49,560 --> 02:05:50,879
put down your guns

1612
02:05:50,920 --> 02:05:52,433
- 203
- Baojun

1613
02:05:52,680 --> 02:05:53,829
ignors me

1614
02:05:54,360 --> 02:05:55,634
I'II count to three

1615
02:05:55,680 --> 02:05:59,559
Put down your guns or I'll shoot him

1616
02:06:01,120 --> 02:06:02,394
1

1617
02:06:03,280 --> 02:06:04,554
2

1618
02:06:22,520 --> 02:06:23,839
Bro 9

1619
02:06:24,360 --> 02:06:25,918
Bro 9

1620
02:08:06,360 --> 02:08:07,509
Mom

1621
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:08,999
Knotti

1622
02:08:09,520 --> 02:08:10,999
Mom

1623
02:08:24,680 --> 02:08:25,795
It's over

1624
02:08:26,160 --> 02:08:27,878
I hope Knotti's generation

1625
02:08:28,120 --> 02:08:29,633
won't see war again

1626
02:08:30,400 --> 02:08:31,435
Right

1627
02:08:31,840 --> 02:08:33,159
you asked to resign

1628
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:34,833
HQ does not object

1629
02:08:37,000 --> 02:08:38,752
because I've never reported to them

1630
02:08:39,280 --> 02:08:40,713
It seems you and the squad

1631
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:42,393
will take on ths next mission

1632
02:08:42,680 --> 02:08:43,715
This is an order

1633
02:08:47,560 --> 02:08:49,152
Yes, Captain

1634
02:09:19,680 --> 02:09:21,398
- Grandma
- My boy

1635
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:25,231
- Eat the fish
- Smells good

1636
02:09:25,520 --> 02:09:27,033
Haven't tasted Grandma's fish in so long

1637
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:28,839
Eat more

1638
02:09:30,120 --> 02:09:31,712
Why are there so many guests?

1639
02:09:32,080 --> 02:09:33,513
What guests?

1640
02:09:33,840 --> 02:09:35,432
They are all our family

1641
02:09:35,680 --> 02:09:37,671
It's the New Year, we're having family dinner

1642
02:09:37,840 --> 02:09:39,353
As we do every year

1643
02:10:08,640 --> 02:10:10,710
Lad, you've grown up

1644
02:10:11,320 --> 02:10:12,355
Grandpa

1645
02:10:12,640 --> 02:10:14,153
You haven't been home in years

1646
02:10:14,200 --> 02:10:15,872
Sit down, sit down

1647
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:19,915
Goos timing! We can have family dinner

1648
02:10:19,960 --> 02:10:21,916
together on New Year's Eve

1649
02:10:22,400 --> 02:10:23,753
Dig in

1650
02:10:26,680 --> 02:10:27,829
Oh, and-

1651
02:10:28,120 --> 02:10:29,838
when I was little, grandpa said

1652
02:10:30,120 --> 02:10:32,236
Tiger Mountain had a hidden airstrip

1653
02:10:32,440 --> 02:10:34,431
If I'm to imagine

1654
02:10:34,720 --> 02:10:36,153
Yang's saving grandma

1655
02:10:36,360 --> 02:10:37,998
it might have been like that

1656
02:13:11,000 --> 02:13:12,513
You son of a bitch

1657
02:13:13,200 --> 02:13:14,997
Who the hell are you?.

1658
02:13:16,920 --> 02:13:18,319
Put down your gun

1659
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:20,234
One Word:

1660
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:22,199
I assure your life

1661
02:13:25,240 --> 02:13:26,912
I assure your death

1662
02:13:57,520 --> 02:13:59,590
One Word:

1663
02:14:00,680 --> 02:14:02,796
I won't say one word

1664
02:14:57,880 --> 02:15:00,997
"YANG Zirong
Original name: YANG Zonggui"

1665
02:15:01,040 --> 02:15:04,555
"Birthplace: Yujia River Village,
Mu county, Shandong Province"'

1666
02:15:08,280 --> 02:15:11,317
"Yang and his comrades in arms"

1667
02:15:11,360 --> 02:15:14,511
"at the commendation ceremony on August 1, 1946"
