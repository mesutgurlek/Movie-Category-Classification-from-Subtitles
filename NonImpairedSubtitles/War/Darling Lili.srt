Well, not really, but,
you must admit, it is a bit unnatural.

Well, yes,

what a pleasure to meet you.

Good morning.

- Please forgive us this intrusion.
- No intrusion at all.

532
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:37,515
This is my colleague,
Lieutenant Liggett.

533
00:48:37,548 --> 00:48:38,716
Very...

534
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,052
And I am Captain Duvalle.

535
00:48:41,086 --> 00:48:43,554
- We are with army intelligence.
- Oui.

536
00:48:43,588 --> 00:48:45,290
Won't you sit down?

537
00:48:48,593 --> 00:48:50,228
Now, how can I help you?

538
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:54,565
You are a friend
of Major William F. Larrabee.

539
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,001
Yes.

540
00:48:58,103 --> 00:49:00,138
We have reason to believe

541
00:49:00,171 --> 00:49:03,708
that Major Larrabee is passing
military secrets to the enemy.

542
00:49:06,044 --> 00:49:08,146
You can't be serious.

543
00:49:08,179 --> 00:49:11,682
There is no question
that vital data is leaking out

544
00:49:11,716 --> 00:49:14,352
concerning Allied air operations.

545
00:49:14,385 --> 00:49:17,755
A reminder, very few men having
access to this information

546
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:21,459
the foremost is Major Larrabee.

547
00:49:21,492 --> 00:49:25,196
We strongly suspect that he is
passing the information

548
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:26,764
to a German secret agent.

549
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,034
But this is preposterous,

550
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:31,036
even to suggest
that Major Larrabee's a traitor.

551
00:49:31,069 --> 00:49:33,738
I hope I'm wrong
and that is why we are here.

552
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,175
We need your cooperation.

You're asking me to be an informer.

00:49:49,187 --> 00:49:51,089
I'm asking you to help establish

557

Major Larrabee's guilt or innocence.

558
00:49:55,193 --> 00:49:57,262
Mademoiselle Smith,

559
00:49:57,295 --> 00:50:00,665
we must discover
who this German agent is

560
00:50:00,698 --> 00:50:03,568
and apprehend her.

561
00:50:03,601 --> 00:50:07,205
It is a matter of national s-s-securite.

562

It is a matter of self-respect.

When you have some proof
of your allegations,

then I might, perhaps, reconsider.

Well, I...

569
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:22,620
It's our opinion that Major Larrabee

570
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:24,722
is giving information to a woman.

571
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,825
Of course, it's only an opinion.

00:50:42,773 --> 00:50:45,343
he is doing so unwillingly.

Well, as I've said before,
when you have some proof,

00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:02,460
then I might consider helping you,

01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:45,975
Larrabee's squadron
was in the air, but Larrabee was not.

834
01:10:46,009 --> 01:10:47,711
Moreover, we've checked every channel

835
01:10:47,744 --> 01:10:49,413
and nothing at all has filtered down

836
01:10:49,446 --> 01:10:51,381
about any Operation Crepe Suzette.

837
01:10:51,415 --> 01:10:55,051
So, either it is
even more important than we imagined

838
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,287
or it simply doesn't exist.

839
01:10:59,055 --> 01:11:00,557
And if it doesn't?

840
01:11:00,590 --> 01:11:02,892
Then he's onto you.

841
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:04,794
It's possible, I suppose,

842
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:07,931
but my every instinct says no.

843
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:10,500
Then what's the alternative?

844
01:11:10,534 --> 01:11:12,001
Another woman?

845
01:11:14,404 --> 01:11:16,005
It's our opinion that Major Larrabee

846
01:11:16,039 --> 01:11:18,375
is giving information to a woman.

847
01:11:18,408 --> 01:11:19,809
I fly at dawn.
Goodbye, darling.

848
01:11:19,843 --> 01:11:23,313
How did you fare
with Operation Crepe Suzette?

849
01:11:23,347 --> 01:11:25,048
(Duvalle)
He's being coerced.

850
01:11:25,081 --> 01:11:26,850
(Lili)
He's being seduced.

851
01:11:26,883 --> 01:11:28,051
Yes, I'm a lieutenant.

852
01:11:28,084 --> 01:11:29,619
(Lili)
Operation Crepe Suzette.

853
01:11:29,653 --> 01:11:30,787
Suzette. Suzette.

854
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:32,322
Lili.

855
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:36,693
Lili.

[Thunder clapping]

859
01:11:47,437 --> 01:11:49,406
Anything wrong?

860
01:11:49,439 --> 01:11:50,640
No.

861
01:11:53,109 --> 01:11:54,844
Any more champagne?

862
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:56,312
Plenty.

863
01:12:08,057 --> 01:12:10,927
[Clinking]

864
01:12:29,446 --> 01:12:30,547
- What?
- Oh.

865
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:31,715
Oh, darling, I'm sorry.

866
01:12:31,748 --> 01:12:33,082
No, no, no. It's ok.

867
01:12:33,116 --> 01:12:34,818
- It was an accident.
- No, it's ok.

868
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,396
- Oh, I've ruined your shirt.
- Doesn't matter.

869
01:12:36,420 --> 01:12:38,455
Well, shouldn't you change?

870
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:40,466
What's the difference?
It's coming off in a minute anyway.

871
01:12:40,490 --> 01:12:43,460
Subtle.

872
01:12:43,493 --> 01:12:45,161
What's wrong?

873
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:48,432
Well, I was just going to ask you.

874
01:12:48,465 --> 01:12:50,166
Ask me what?

875
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:51,868
What's wrong?

876
01:12:51,901 --> 01:12:53,703
- With me?
- Yeah.

877
01:12:53,737 --> 01:12:55,905
Well, nothing, darling,

878
01:12:55,939 --> 01:12:58,141
but I do sense something about you.

879
01:12:58,174 --> 01:13:00,477
Me?

880
01:13:00,510 --> 01:13:01,878
It's really not important.

881
01:13:01,911 --> 01:13:04,514
Well, of course it's important.

882
01:13:04,548 --> 01:13:05,958
The girl that went into that bedroom

883
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:07,751
is not the same girl
who just walked out.

884
01:13:07,784 --> 01:13:09,786
- Rubbish.
- It's not rubbish.

885
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:11,855
We're having our first fight.

886
01:13:11,888 --> 01:13:13,899
We are not fighting. I am simply
trying to point out...

Bill.

Carry me.

01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:30,607
What?

891
01:13:30,640 --> 01:13:31,775
Carry me.

892
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:58,635
- To my room.
- Hmm?

I'm sorry, darling, really, I am.

01:15:30,326 --> 01:15:32,829
I just can't help it.

900
01:15:35,732 --> 01:15:37,133
Are you all right?

901
01:15:37,166 --> 01:15:39,636
What do you mean, "all right"?

902
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:42,071
Oh, come, now.
You've got to admit,

903
01:15:42,105 --> 01:15:45,341
seduction can really be very
funny if you stop to think about it.

904
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:47,744
You're not supposed to stop
and think about it.

905
01:15:47,777 --> 01:15:50,714
Oh, Bill, that's a terribly
naive point of view

906
01:15:50,747 --> 01:15:54,684
for a man of your sophistication
and experience.

907
01:15:56,019 --> 01:15:58,254
- Bill?
- Look,

908
01:15:58,287 --> 01:16:00,757
couldn't we talk about this tomorrow?

909
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,258
Oh, I know.

Damn it, Lili.

Sorry, I really can't help it.

913
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:21,077
Oh, if you really wanted me,
it shouldn't matter anyway.

What is it?

01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,090
- What did you just call me?
- What?

919
01:16:34,123 --> 01:16:36,392
- What did you just call me?
- When?

920
01:16:36,425 --> 01:16:39,095
- Think.
- Huh, what in the...

921
01:16:39,128 --> 01:16:41,173
- Think! What did you just call me?
- What do you mean?

922
01:16:41,197 --> 01:16:43,142
- How do I know what I called you?
- You called me darling,

923
01:16:43,166 --> 01:16:47,170
you called me your love,
and you called me something else.

924
01:16:47,203 --> 01:16:48,805
I said you were wonderful...

925
01:16:48,838 --> 01:16:50,740
You called me something else, a name.

926
01:16:50,774 --> 01:16:51,975
A name?

927
01:16:52,008 --> 01:16:53,176
[Sighing]
Suzette.

928
01:16:53,209 --> 01:16:55,211
- What?
- You called me Suzette.

929
01:16:55,244 --> 01:16:57,213
- The hell I did.
- The hell you didn't. You did.

930
01:16:57,246 --> 01:16:59,749
- The hell I did. Why would I call you Suzette?
- I don't know.

931
01:16:59,783 --> 01:17:01,217
- Do you know a Suzette?
- No!

01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:02,752
- You don't?
- No.

Yeah?

I'm sorry.

I am.

- My pet.
- What?

01:17:29,078 --> 01:17:31,715
My pet, that's what I called you.

- My pet?
- You're damn right.

942
01:17:33,850 --> 01:17:35,318
My pet. Sounds like "Suzette."

943
01:17:35,351 --> 01:17:37,020
Suzette, my pet.
My pet, Suzette.

01:17:37,053 --> 01:17:39,055
- That's what I thought.
- Oh.

01:17:43,192 --> 01:17:44,961
- Now what's wrong?
- Nothing.

Don't tell me nothing.

948
01:17:47,463 --> 01:17:50,099
Did you really call me "my pet"?

949
01:17:50,133 --> 01:17:53,302
Yes. I really called you my pet.

950
01:17:53,336 --> 01:17:55,480
- What's the matter with that?
- Nothing. Nothing at all.

951
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:57,406
Okay.

Oh, Bill? Oh, darling.

Oh, sweet, forgive me.

01:18:13,456 --> 01:18:16,325
I've been behaving like an idiot
schoolgirl and I'm sorry.

01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:19,195
I adore you.

[Thunder crashing]

960
01:18:41,417 --> 01:18:44,287
There have been others?

961
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:46,322
Oh, my darling.

962
01:18:46,355 --> 01:18:47,456
Many?

963
01:18:47,490 --> 01:18:49,125
Oh, my sweetheart.

964
01:18:50,994 --> 01:18:52,128
- Bill.
- What?

965
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:54,063
You're not being honest.

966
01:18:54,097 --> 01:18:56,465
- What do you mean, not being honest?
- What about Suzette?

967
01:18:56,499 --> 01:18:58,167
Oh, damn it to hell, Lili,

968
01:18:58,201 --> 01:18:59,502
I told you, there is no Suzette.

969
01:18:59,535 --> 01:19:01,037
Operation Crepe Suzette.

970
01:19:01,070 --> 01:19:03,006
- That's not a woman.
- Then what is it?

971
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:05,184
Oh, for God's sake, Lili,
you heard T.C. the other night.

972
01:19:05,208 --> 01:19:08,144
Operation Crepe Suzette is a
military secret... that's what you said.

973
01:19:08,177 --> 01:19:12,115
And that's what it is.
It's so important, I can't even tell you.

974
01:19:12,148 --> 01:19:13,549
It isn't that I don't trust you.

975
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:16,519
It's just a matter of national security.

976
01:19:16,552 --> 01:19:19,989
I wouldn't even tell my own mother.

977
01:19:20,023 --> 01:19:21,490
[Thunder rumbling]

978
01:19:23,492 --> 01:19:25,428
[Sighing]
All right.

979
01:19:25,461 --> 01:19:27,897
You wanna know
about Operation Crepe Suzette?

980
01:19:27,931 --> 01:19:30,575
- I'll tell you about Operation Crepe Suzette.
- I'd rather you didn't.

981
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:33,178
- You're gonna hear about it anyway.
- I don't want you to break...

982
01:19:33,202 --> 01:19:36,105
The hell with security!
I wanna get this straight once and for all.

983
01:19:36,139 --> 01:19:40,009
You want honesty, you're going to get
honesty and I could get shot for it.

984
01:19:40,043 --> 01:19:41,577
I'm gonna give you every little detail

985
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:43,346
of the biggest military operation

986
01:19:43,379 --> 01:19:45,048
since Battle of the Marne.

987
01:19:45,081 --> 01:19:47,450
Now, last weekend, after I left you,

988
01:19:47,483 --> 01:19:51,020
I reported to intelligence for
a top-secret briefing and it was big.

989
01:19:51,054 --> 01:19:53,522
I mean, really big.
Everybody was there.

990
01:19:53,556 --> 01:19:56,860
D'Esperey, Hirschauer,
Joffre, all of them.

991
01:19:56,893 --> 01:19:58,227
And the English brass, too.

992
01:19:58,261 --> 01:20:00,096
Rawlinson, even Haig.

993
01:20:00,129 --> 01:20:03,066
The Germans were building
a secret weapon so big,

994
01:20:03,099 --> 01:20:06,970
so devastating, that it might have
ended the war tomorrow.
