1
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:07,215
Ah, Collins. Morning, Hammond.

2
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,098
- Sir Edward.
- A black day for us all.

3
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,410
Particularly the officers of the Renown.

4
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,377
HAMMOND: Not to mention Captain Sawyer.

5
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,497
Hardly the circumstances either of us
would have chosen

6
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,048
to reacquaint ourselves with Mr Hornblower.

7
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,250
No, they're not.

8
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,695
Still, the guilty must be punished.

9
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:28,453
If indeed they are guilty, Captain Hammond,

10
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:30,735
which is yet to be established.

11
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:42,256
All rise.

12
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,452
This court is now in session.

13
00:01:56,540 --> 00:01:58,496
(Bangs gavel)

14
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:09,056
Officers of His Majesty's ship Renown.

15
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,975
It is charged that you did forcibly remove
Captain James Sawyer

16
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,573
from his lawful command,

17
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,609
and, in breach of the Articles of War
laid down by King George ll,

18
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,659
did commit...the act of mutiny.

19
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,696
(Cannonfire)

20
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,056
At least we are safely out of range.

21
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,892
For the time being, sir.

22
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:40,370
I tell you, gentlemen,
another five minutes under fire...

23
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:42,974
I would not like to guess.

24
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,818
- Quick as you can with that, Matthews.
- Seven down, four to go.

25
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:51,416
- You'd think it's a bride's wedding dress.
-No harm in giving them a decent send-off.

26
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,572
I only hope a cheery soul will do
this for me when my time comes.

27
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,448
Come along, man! The sooner you're done
the sooner we sail for Jamaica.

28
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,178
Am I not right, Mr Hornblower?

29
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,932
Indeed, sir.

30
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,659
Sergeant! Get the men below decks!

31
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:08,210
Sir, how is the captain?

32
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,971
A little better.

33
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,254
Untie me.

34
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:16,256
Untie your captain at once!

35
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:20,176
You're not yourself, sir.

36
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,652
I know you.

37
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:26,068
Either come in or go out, Mr Wellard.

38
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:28,186
Don 't just stand there like
a startled rabbit.

39
00:03:28,187 --> 00:03:30,369
Mr Buckland's compliments, sir...

40
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,371
Very well.

41
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:35,020
I shall be back within the hour, sir.

42
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:48,499
Another dozen and you'll coo like a dove.

43
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:51,094
I'm not your whipping boy now...sir.

44
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,136
Wellard.

45
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:59,217
BUCKLAND:..in the sure and certain knowledge
of the resurrection,

46
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,450
we commit the body of these men to the deep.

47
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,178
James McNeal.

48
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,737
Matthew Chandler.

49
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:13,457
We pray also for the speedy recovery
of our captain James Sawyer.

50
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:16,008
- Hypocrite.
- Who said that?

51
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,096
Who said that?

52
00:04:19,140 --> 00:04:23,418
And we pray for a swiff passage to Jamaica,
where we may dock safely at Kingston

53
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,013
and put this tragedy behind us.

54
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,499
Amen.

55
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,377
ALL: Amen.

56
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:36,058
I wouldn 't sail up the Thames in
a river boat with this crew.

57
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:38,210
I don 't see we have much
choice in the matter.

58
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,897
No? Well, let me tell you at times like
this, it's every man for himself.

59
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,533
But, sir, if we sail behind the fort
round the bay here,

60
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,576
there is a good landing beach.

61
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:55,458
We can attack the fort overland
where they least expect us.

62
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:57,451
Then, with the fort in our hands,

63
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,532
we could bottle up
the Spanish ships in the bay.

64
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:03,054
Impossible. We sail for Kingston.

65
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,051
Dawn tomorrow. Mr Bush?

66
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:08,257
We've tried to fulfil our orders.
We've clearly failed.

67
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:12,777
That's the point, sir. The last thing
they'd expect is a further assault.

68
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,737
With respect, sir, we can 't afford a delay.

69
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:18,813
When, according to your scheme,
should we launch this attack?

70
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:23,451
Tonight, sir. Under the cover of darkness.
A matter of hours affer the last attack.

71
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:25,212
The virtue of surprise.

72
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,291
You're a man in a hurry, Mr Hornblower.

73
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,334
But I fear this is a venture too far.

74
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,456
Morale is fragile enough as it is.

75
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:38,768
Mr Bush?

76
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,496
It goes against the grain to give up, sir.
But maybe you're right.

77
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:50,777
There is another matter, sir.
When we reach Kingston we will face trial.

78
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,375
We have nothing to fear from any trial.
We acted for the good of the ship.

79
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,933
Captain Sawyer would have sunk
every man aboard if we four hadn 't
had our wits about us.

80
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,370
Besides, we've got the good doctor's
endorsement. From his own lips.

81
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,291
"Unfit for command."

82
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:09,572
So...

83
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:11,855
So, so.

84
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:16,495
A little cabal muttering together.

85
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,936
Damn it. Pass the word for Dr Clive.

86
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:24,059
One of you had his dirty hands on my back.

87
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,576
I'll remember.

88
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:31,090
I'll remember.

89
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:32,090
Dr Clive.

90
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,932
Sir.

91
00:06:34,020 --> 00:06:35,976
Can you do nothing for him?

92
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:39,291
What exactly did you have in mind,
Mr Buckland?

93
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,410
PELLEW: Was the captain well, or no?

94
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,411
Yes, sir.

95
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,411
Which?

96
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,411
He was indisposed, sir.

97
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,252
Temporarily.

98
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,535
Affer his fall into the hold.

99
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,373
"Unfit to command."

100
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:07,213
- A bold choice of words.
- Aye, sir.

101
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,939
And, if I may say so, not worth a farthing.

102
00:07:11,300 --> 00:07:12,335
Really?

103
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,650
My consent was given only under duress, sir.

104
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:17,015
(Whispers) Oh, my God. He's killed us all.

105
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,615
What do you mean by duress?
Someone forced you?

106
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,894
Did they put a gun to your head?

107
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,972
Come on, man. Did they or did they not?

108
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,897
Not a gun as such.

109
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:34,529
We were under fire, sir.
And in the heat of battle...

110
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:38,056
The decision was taken
to detain the captain.

111
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:40,051
That is correct, sir.

112
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,255
And who, might I ask, took that decision?

113
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,251
It was Lieutenant Hornblower, sir.

114
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:53,937
Surely Mr Buckland was the senior officer.
Why did he not give the order?

115
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,094
With respect,
I think that is a question for Mr Buckland.

116
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,293
KENNED Y: Acting captain.

117
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:11,735
I tell you, Horatio,
never was a man more aptly named.

118
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,175
He plays a part, and he
doesn 't even believe it.

119
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:16,171
No more do l.

120
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,297
Archie, we have already lost one captain.

121
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,336
Yes. Yes, I know.

122
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,376
But we could be halfway to the fort by now.

123
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,171
- If only Mr Bush...
- If only?

124
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,097
Ah. Forgive me.

125
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:33,256
The virtue of surprise, Mr Kennedy.

126
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,618
Which, if I'm not mistaken, Mr Hornblower,
was the essence of your proposal.

127
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,373
- That was the plan, yes.
- And a fine plan. I commend you.

128
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,939
But... Sir?

129
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,371
I made an error of judgment earlier,
which we must now seek to repair together.

130
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:50,339
And in haste.

131
00:08:50,420 --> 00:08:53,856
Yes. For I see if we do nothing,
we shall hang.

132
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,851
When?

133
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:58,659
Tonight. Are you in?

134
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,692
You know the penalty for desertion?

135
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,691
They hang you.

136
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:07,739
So what? If I stay aboard this ship
I'll get a knife in my back.

137
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:11,051
I've made too many enemies. We both have.

138
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,738
Well?

139
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:18,291
Do you think I could leave my captain
at the mercy of those...lieutenants?

140
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:20,336
What's going on?

141
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,178
I'll call that a yes, then, shall l?

142
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,009
Oi! Where do you think you're going?

143
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:49,611
Cartridges and powder. A musket a man.

144
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,660
Come on. Cop hold of these. Quickly!

145
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,896
I wondered where you'd got to.

146
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,891
I can 't leave him.

147
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:13,733
Sawyer?
The man can 't remember his own name.

148
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:17,449
I haven 't sailed with him all these years
to leave him now.

149
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,771
I'll get to Kingston,
and see them hang for what they did to him.

150
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:22,737
This is goodbye, then?

151
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:29,413
Something to remember me by.

152
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:42,248
PELLEW: The captain injured,
the crew deserting in droves,

153
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,969
and yet Mr Buckland
chose to press on with his mission.

154
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,096
Indeed, sir. With our full support, sir.

155
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:51,855
- May I ask why?
- It was our duty, sir.

156
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,339
Duty.

157
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:57,048
Duty to whom?

158
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:00,011
To our captain, sir, while he was...

159
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,453
Indisposed. Yes.

160
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:06,658
A happy day for James Sawyer
when you four gentlemen came aboard.

161
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,492
Thank you, sir.

162
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,536
(Chuckles)

163
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,612
You speak of duty, Mr Hornblower.

164
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,010
And I would speak to you of ambition.

165
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,094
For a man of your years
you have risen smartly through the ranks.

166
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,138
Certainly I hold myself fortunate
in my position, sir.

167
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:28,259
Mm-hm. And hungry to climb higher,
I dare say.

168
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,491
Not unless my service should warrant it.

169
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:35,209
Come, sir. We can hardly condemn a man
for proving his ability.

170
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,733
Nor do I wish to, Commodore.

171
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,687
But how offen can a young man shine
on a slow voyage far-

172
00:11:40,688 --> 00:11:44,536
from the front line of battle
unless he spies an opportunity?

173
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,433
A vulnerable captain.

174
00:11:47,434 --> 00:11:51,500
A First Lieutenant preoccupied with
the burden thrust upon him.

175
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:54,498
A chance to leapfrog the chain of command.

176
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,457
- Sir, I protest...
- I apologise, sir.

177
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,815
I merely put the question.

178
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:03,052
What would this young man do
if he was hungry enough?

179
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:06,496
And I will have my answer.
You can depend on it.

180
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,655
MATTHEWS: Out or down!

181
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,332
Come on! Show a leg.

182
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,489
(Groans)

183
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:15,536
Come on!

184
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,576
Out or down!

185
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:19,616
What the...

186
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,888
They've run.

187
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,498
The buggers have run!

188
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:26,298
Styles!

189
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,615
On deck! Move yourselves!

190
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:34,770
Stay away from the side there!

191
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,977
Any man so much as looks at the water
will be shot.

192
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,130
- Sergeant.
- Aye aye, sir.

193
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,690
Keep away from the side!
You heard the officer.

194
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:45,133
Well, Mr Matthews?

195
00:12:45,220 --> 00:12:48,098
We're missing 34 men, sir.

196
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,852
Sorry, sir. That's 33 men missing, sir.

197
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,016
33.

198
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,856
I'm...

199
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,215
not entirely sure how best to proceed.

200
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,576
Sir, if I may suggest.

201
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,537
I believe the crew is afraid.

202
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:17,536
Afraid of what awaits them in Kingston.

203
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:19,531
What awaits all of us.

204
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,214
They need something to rally behind?

205
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,530
You think I should attack the fort?

206
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:26,133
Action may raise spirits, sir.

207
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:28,370
But we have to do it quick, sir.

208
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,419
And if we fail, I am double damned.

209
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,014
To be damned once will settle for us all.

210
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:39,656
Do it, Mr Bush.

211
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,459
Let's try and save ourselves.

212
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,019
We attack the fort!

213
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:45,852
ALL: Hooray!

214
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:30,212
We'd best make haste.
I fear daylight's upon us.

215
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:33,610
- If Mr Buckland had decided earlier...
- I'm partly to blame for that.

216
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:37,978
Put that behind us. We can still rely
on surprise.And a little Spanish apathy.

217
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,536
Careful, Mr Wellard.

218
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,896
We don 't want to let the dagos know
we're here for breakfast, do we?

219
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,015
No.

220
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,170
You stick by me, and
I'll see you're all right.

221
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:52,820
That's right, Mr Hobbs.
We stand by each other.

222
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,698
As you did,
when you picked up that nasty head wound.

223
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,736
I'm ready to do my duty, Mr Matthews.

224
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,299
Ha.

225
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,209
Horatio?

226
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,936
- What is it?
- It's Randall and the deserters, sir.

227
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,897
Well, get down, man.

228
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:19,896
There's nothing to fear, sir.

229
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,496
Oh, my God.

230
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,987
Well, I take it we are all agreed that

231
00:15:49,988 --> 00:15:52,800
Captain Sawyer's good name
must be preserved.

232
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,128
Of course.

233
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,131
Good. Yes.

234
00:15:56,220 --> 00:16:01,135
But together with the lives of those
young officers caught up in a situation...

235
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,132
(Sighs) not of their making.

236
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:06,176
Quite so.

237
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:09,058
I am simply concerned
that we need a clear outcome.

238
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:12,849
What do you propose, Hammond?
Hang them all from the nearest yardarm?

239
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:15,329
No, no. Nothing so spectacular.

240
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,775
But if there were one man...

241
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,851
A scapegoat.

242
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:23,896
No. A guilty party.

243
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,211
Maliciously motivated.

244
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,938
Jealous.

245
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:30,089
Ambitious.

246
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,455
Who do you have in mind?

247
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,496
It's early days.

248
00:16:34,580 --> 00:16:36,138
But we will find someone...

249
00:16:36,220 --> 00:16:38,017
(Fly buzzes)

250
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,014
..to take away the smell.

251
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,136
(Sighs)

252
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,176
(Grunts)

253
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:54,498
It seems the Dons were more vigilant
than we thought.

254
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,298
So much for the virtue of surprise.

255
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,569
Horatio?

256
00:17:02,420 --> 00:17:04,251
You think this the work of the Spanish?

257
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,337
No gunfire. No sign of a struggle or alarm.

258
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:11,856
It looks like they were taken
in their sleep.

259
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:15,819
- Permission to bury the dead, sir?
- I fear we have no time. Come on. Move up.

260
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,696
Mr Hobbs.

261
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,656
Hey, Hobbs.

262
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,171
Randall's a crab's breakfast affer all.

263
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:30,296
I heard, Styles.

264
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:34,171
If you weren 't such a decent sort
you'd be lying there with him.

265
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,012
(Whispers) Styles?

266
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,056
Raise your voice one more time,

267
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,258
I swear, if the Spanish don 't get to
you first,I'll kill you. Understand me?

268
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,489
Yes, sir.

269
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,330
Bloody hell. I thought Sawyer was a bastard.

270
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,980
A friendly word of advice, Styles. Shut it.

271
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,896
Soffly, now. Quiet as you can.

272
00:17:56,420 --> 00:17:58,058
So if it wasn 't the Spanish...

273
00:17:58,140 --> 00:18:00,210
Then, with luck, they won 't
be expecting us.

274
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:03,019
Mr Hornblower,
if it wasn 't the Spanish, who was it?

275
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:05,056
I wouldn 't like to guess, sir.

276
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,489
(Knocking)

277
00:18:48,580 --> 00:18:49,615
Come in.

278
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,452
Is he asleep?

279
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,939
It looks like it.

280
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,776
Paperwork, Dr Clive.

281
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:59,613
The burden of rank, Mr Buckland.

282
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,651
Every page read by the Admiralty.

283
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,696
I fear I can 't be careful enough.

284
00:19:04,780 --> 00:19:06,736
This always helps me.

285
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:13,498
Uneasy lies the head that wears the crown.

286
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:17,978
Isn't that so, Acting Captain?

287
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:21,970
Especially when your head's
not born to lead.

288
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,413
He's awake.

289
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,936
You're not well.

290
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:30,817
I'll work in the wardroom.

291
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:33,050
That's it. Go on. Run away.

292
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:34,812
Captain, be still.

293
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,175
Oh, my ancient lieutenant.

294
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:42,493
Can 't decide. Can 't control. No authority.
Dither. Dither. Dither.

295
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,059
Sir, with respect...

296
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:47,257
Untie me, and I'll speak for
you in Kingston.

297
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,376
You're too young for the noose.

298
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:50,256
Pray, be silent.

299
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,934
Even though too old for anything else.

300
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:55,488
Dr Clive, more laudanum.

301
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,140
He already has enough in him to fell an ox.

302
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,176
(Knocking)
- Yes!

303
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,216
You're needed on deck, sir.

304
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,976
That's my boat!

305
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,536
What in God's name...?

306
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,809
MAN : Arretez!

307
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:42,257
I am Francois Lefanu,
Colonel of the Free Army of Santo Domingo.

308
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,898
I say to you, sir,

309
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,817
this is not your fight.

310
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,049
Leave this place!

311
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,971
- Free Army.
- Jumped-up slaves.

312
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:52,813
What's he doing on my boat?
And with my own men.

313
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:57,769
- Do I give the order to fire, sir?
-No. You will do no such thing.
N -Not until l...

314
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:00,294
Sir. Get us out of here! Sir!

315
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,735
You will return my men at once,

316
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,050
or I will open fire.

317
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:07,449
Marines, ready!

318
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:11,169
Our army has liberated this island
for our own people.

319
00:21:11,260 --> 00:21:14,536
- You could ask them aboard.
- How would it look? Talks with a slave?

320
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:16,531
He's in range. We could take him now, sir.

321
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,053
No! I said no.

322
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,371
Well?

323
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,338
I think we have the advantage of them, sir.

324
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,131
Indeed we do.

325
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,938
What news?

326
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:48,296
Would you care to observe the enemy,
Mr Kennedy?

327
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,136
(Laughs)

328
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,329
Good God!

329
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:02,611
That gentleman needs no lessons in his duty.

330
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:05,339
BUSH: Even in this hour.
KENNED Y: Well, well, well.

331
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:08,651
That's enough, Mr Kennedy.
May I remind you why we're here.

332
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:12,176
Recall your men
and there will be no more bloodshed.

333
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,249
Sir!

334
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,900
Bloodshed? What bloodshed?

335
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:18,016
Randall and the other deserters. sir.

336
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:23,333
We believed they were Spanish.
But we have no quarrel with you.

337
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:26,412
Recall the rest of your men,
and no harm will come to these two.

338
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,616
- Mr Buckland.
- One moment.

339
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,489
Gardez l'homme! Vite!

340
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,369
Bring them on.

341
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,419
(Laughs) Still at it, sir?

342
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:46,535
Styles.

343
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,366
That's the last warning. From now on,
if you breathe out of turn

344
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:52,907
I'll have your neck. Agreed?

345
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:58,096
Release my men at once!

346
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:01,377
I said release...my...men.

347
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,529
Front rank, present.

348
00:23:07,100 --> 00:23:09,056
- Do we fire, sir?
- Fire?

349
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:13,528
(Gunfire)

350
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,252
What bloody fool?

351
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,932
No. I said no!

352
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,453
Cease fire!

353
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,891
I gave no order!

354
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:27,377
Cessez! Cessez!

355
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:28,813
Oh, God.

356
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,856
Sir.

357
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,774
Renowns, charge!

358
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,816
(Cheering)

359
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:49,299
You will regret this.

360
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:52,338
- Front rank, load!
- I swear to you, sir, you will regret this!

361
00:23:54,380 --> 00:23:58,134
The men saw me undecided,
and they acted without me.

362
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:00,654
Now I've sent the Spanish fort
a note by pigeon post.

363
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,651
We cannot be sure.

364
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:04,970
Oh, yes. I think we can.

365
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,415
If we'd gone to Kingston, as I wished...

366
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:11,532
We've lost enough time.
We head back to the mouth of the bay.

367
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,895
- Sir?
- The bay, Dr Clive.

368
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:17,052
To take off what survivors there may be.

369
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:19,096
(Cheering)

370
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,970
Marines, form line. Engage the parapet.
Renowns, with me!

371
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,736
Go on, sir!

372
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:48,778
Present! Fire!

373
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,410
Back! Back! Back!

374
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,058
(Confused shouting)

375
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,579
Up against the wall!

376
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,249
Keep it tight!

377
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:34,132
-Archie. Up there. Your friend
from the tower.
-What?

378
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,176
Look!

379
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,536
- What's he doing up there?
- Exactly. Matthews, come with me.

380
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,735
Aye aye, sir.

381
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,052
Hornblower! Where the hell are you going?
Marines, to me!

382
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,699
We must find Hobbs and that gunpowder.
Quickly now!

383
00:26:06,340 --> 00:26:08,137
The only way out is up, sir.

384
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,259
Anything that's not brush.
Mortar, a pipe, anything.

385
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:19,376
Horatio, what the hell are we doing here?

386
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:22,691
- The officer.
- What, from the tower?

387
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,736
How did he get across to the fort?

388
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,135
Plain daylight. Heavy crossfire.

389
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,370
He came by his own route. He came...

390
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:32,337
Sir? Over here, sir.

391
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:37,491
(All shout)

392
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,975
Hola, mi amigo.

393
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:43,096
I'll make you smile, you bastard!

394
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,250
Argh!

395
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,776
What is this, sir?

396
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,771
This, Matthews, is our back door.

397
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,816
It's not a very big one, sir.

398
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,455
What?

399
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:19,014
- Everything all right, Mr Wellard?
- Fine.

400
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,419
What do you see, Mr Wellard?

401
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,968
Nothing yet.

402
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,015
It looks clear.

403
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,011
Now, let him down.

404
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,931
- Easy, easy.
(Gunshot)

405
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,011
Arrrgh!

406
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:45,294
All right, Mr Wellard?

407
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,819
Nothing broken, sir.

408
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,971
HORNBLOWER: What do you see?

409
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,813
- Mr Wellard?
- Oh, no...

410
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,333
What do you see, Mr Wellard?

411
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,058
They're coming, sir.

412
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,732
Mr Wellard.

413
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:04,979
Fire! You must fire!

414
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,014
Run, boy. Run!

415
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,772
(Shouting in Spanish)

416
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,574
(All shout)

417
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,176
(Shouting)

418
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,856
Right face! Right face!

419
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,656
Damn Hornblower!

420
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,416
Mr Wellard!

421
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,649
Wellard!

422
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,175
Sir.

423
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,894
Come on, men!

424
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,773
The leff side!

425
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,816
The leff side!

426
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:26,575
Atencion!

427
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:32,254
Son los ingleses! En las galerias!
Las galerias!

428
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:36,337
- It's hopeless, sir.
- I'll say when it's hopeless, Styles.

429
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,336
Apunta.

430
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,170
Fuego!

431
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,134
- What now?
- Full toss, Mr Hobbs.

432
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,778
Aye aye, sir.

433
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,136
(Shouting in Spanish)

434
00:30:07,700 --> 00:30:09,338
You must surrender.

435
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:12,571
If you live to see Mr Hornblower,
tell him...

436
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:15,935
Nothing.

437
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:18,857
Come on, men!

438
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,532
You must surrender.

439
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:23,418
Tell him he'll hang from the yardarm.

440
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,936
(Screaming)

441
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,695
Glad to see you're safe, Mr Bush.

442
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:44,130
Renowns! To me!

443
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,859
- Come on, men!
(All cheer)

444
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:19,134
Over there!

445
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,214
Will you surrender?

446
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,693
Any sign of the Renown?

447
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:35,055
I don 't believe it. They're escaping.

448
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,096
- Who?
- The Spanish ships, that's who.

449
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,693
Marines! Present!

450
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,611
Now will you surrender?

451
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,533
Sir.

452
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,417
BOTH: Sir!

453
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,612
Still no sign of the Renown. Damn!

454
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:59,330
If those ships make it out to sea
we might as well not have bothered
with the fort.

455
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,729
Hot shot, sir. Nothing like it.

456
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,651
Haul away!

457
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:28,018
May l, sir?

458
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,328
By all means.

459
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,535
Run her out.

460
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,255
Fire!

461
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,893
Mr Kennedy?

462
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,778
20 yards short. The sea boils, Mr Bush.

463
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:47,694
We want burning ships, not a boiling sea!

464
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,691
Sir.

465
00:32:49,780 --> 00:32:51,736
This shot won 't go in. It's too big.

466
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,936
And I don 't like the look of this, sir.

467
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:00,209
Stop! Leave the gun!

468
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:04,009
- She's going to blow!
- Leave the gun! Run! Run!

469
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:15,176
(Groaning)

470
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,976
I know what happens when metal overheats.
My uncle was a blacksmith.

471
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:21,779
I believe they call it the coefficient
of expansion.

472
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,612
I call it bloody dangerous.

473
00:33:23,613 --> 00:33:26,163
I'm glad you find some amusement
in the situation-

474
00:33:26,364 --> 00:33:29,322
because of my...elementary mistake.

475
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:33,130
Come, gentlemen. No time for soul-searching.
The furnace awaits.

476
00:33:38,260 --> 00:33:40,899
Haul away! Coming up.

477
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,616
Belay!

478
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,695
Well done.
Must have been a job persuading them back.

479
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:55,329
- Yes, sir.
BUSH: You can understand their reluctance.

480
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,739
Quite. Hot shot!

481
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,328
- May I?
- Of course, sir.

482
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,494
Run her out!

483
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,016
And...fire!

484
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,373
Mr Kennedy?

485
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:17,135
(Laughs) A hit! A hit! A palpable hit!

486
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:19,176
Run it out again, sir.

487
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,649
Congratulations, sir.

488
00:34:20,740 --> 00:34:22,378
Beginner's luck. No doubt.

489
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:24,132
Stand clear!

490
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,770
What was that? Another hit?

491
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,816
No. Better than that.

492
00:34:34,820 --> 00:34:35,889
It's the Renown, sir!

493
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,618
(Cheering)

494
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,772
What an ingenious plan, Mr Hornblower,

495
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,613
attacking the fort via an underground route.

496
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,179
Highly original.

497
00:34:45,260 --> 00:34:46,329
Thank you, sir.

498
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,580
Whilst leaving Mr Bush and the rest
to fend for themselves.

499
00:34:49,581 --> 00:34:51,459
Placing their lives in jeopardy.

500
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:55,294
But the end result was a triumph.
Would you not agree, Captain Hammond?

501
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:59,168
And then to hoist the Spaniards
with their own petard - a double triumph.

502
00:34:59,260 --> 00:35:02,093
Ah, yes. The hot shot.

503
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:07,851
Nearly a disaster here, I fear, were
it not for Mr Bush's sharp intervention.

504
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:10,329
I am indeed indebted to Mr Bush.

505
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:15,131
Foolhardy actions. Rash judgments.

506
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,336
Irresponsible adventures.

507
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:20,855
Is this to be the measure of your career?

508
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:25,616
Come,now. That is the blackest
interpretation of these events
I can imagine.

509
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:30,330
Quite. Others might well be praising
Mr Hornblower for his ingenuity.

510
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:32,490
I only endeavour to do my duty, sir.

511
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:38,049
Well, I think we shall be the judge of that,
Mr Hornblower.

512
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:40,096
(Church bell tolls)

513
00:35:44,380 --> 00:35:47,452
Well, Commodore, I think our course is set.

514
00:35:47,540 --> 00:35:49,053
Yes.

515
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,347
And one young officer
condemned already,

516
00:35:52,348 --> 00:35:54,849
if we are to follow Captain Hammond's
gospel.

517
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,613
Yes. Pity.

518
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:59,620
I had heard young Hornblower
was one to watch.

519
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:01,656
He served with you, did he not?

520
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,339
Yes.

521
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,338
He was one of the finest.

522
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,179
One of the very best.

523
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:13,979
I can see how this would make you feel...

524
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:15,459
uncomfortable.

525
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,292
Uncomfortable?

526
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:21,419
I've never felt less comfortable
in my entire life, sir.

527
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:26,652
But I will not hang out of hand
a man so dear to me as my...

528
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,933
..as one of my very own.

529
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,055
You have a duty to the law, Commodore.

530
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:38,529
Yes. I have not forgotten it, sir.

531
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,654
But I will not rush to judge any man

532
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:46,369
because the admirals want to
sleep peacefully in their beds.

533
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,815
I will weigh the facts carefully,

534
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:50,936
as we all will, I trust.

535
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:52,929
You doubt it?

536
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,256
Just asking for a fair trial, sir.

537
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,251
And your man will have it.

538
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:02,730
I only hope you're not surprised by
what you find.

539
00:37:08,580 --> 00:37:10,571
As do I.

540
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,774
I take it the fort is ours.

541
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:26,294
- Well done, gentlemen.
- Thank you, sir.

542
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,974
Spanish boat approaching
under flag of truce.

543
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,496
It may be the Spanish
commanding officer, sir.

544
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:35,298
I have arrived just in time to greet him.

545
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:41,091
I dare say you heard about our own
little spot of bother aboard the Renown?

546
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,374
Yes, sir. We heard.

547
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:45,691
I hope it didn 't put you off your
stride in any way.

548
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:46,849
No, sir.

549
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:51,649
Free army. Local peasant banditry.

550
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:54,857
- I doubt if they'll be back in a hurry.
- I hope not, sir.

551
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:57,175
Ah.

552
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,411
Colonel Francisco Manuel Ortega

553
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:09,731
of the Royal Engineers
of His Most Catholic Majesty Carlos lV.

554
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,893
Captain Buckland of
His Majesty's ship Renown.

555
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,332
You wish to give up the entire island?

556
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,934
I know a stalemate when I see one, Captain.

557
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:24,416
Besides, I want to see the women and
children safe, including my own wife.

558
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,218
You have nothing to fear there.

559
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,019
There is space aboard our ships
to carry my people off.

560
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:31,694
We will evacuate the island
and sail with the first tide.

561
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,532
And if we refuse?

562
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,734
The consequences are on your head, sir.

563
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,732
Very well.

564
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,485
I expect you'll hear from us
within the hour.

565
00:38:43,486 --> 00:38:45,600
Thank you, Mr Hornblower.

566
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,450
It was you who led the attack
through the tunnel?

567
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,689
Yes, sir.

568
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:53,696
A bold stroke, Mr Hornblower.

569
00:38:53,780 --> 00:38:55,816
You must watch this man, Captain Buckland.

570
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,492
I do.

571
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,536
Closely.

572
00:38:59,620 --> 00:39:01,372
All right.

573
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,416
Within the hour, Colonel.

574
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,896
As you wish.

575
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:12,892
With respect, sir,
I think we're selling ourselves short.

576
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,448
What do you have in mind?
Make off with their women?

577
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:18,498
I suggest we demand
an unconditional surrender.

578
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,377
Why on earth would he want to do that?

579
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:23,213
I don 't see they have much choice.
The fort is ours already.

580
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,211
Look, Mr Hornblower,

581
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:28,372
may I remind you
of an old and trusted adage?

582
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,416
Tell him, Mr Bush.

583
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:32,814
Sir...

584
00:39:32,900 --> 00:39:35,733
Never look a giff horse
in the mouth.

585
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,692
The island, sir, in British hands.

586
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:45,169
If the island means so much to him,
why is the colonel so keen to quit it?

587
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:48,218
Because that man, at least,
knows when he has lost!

588
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:52,775
The garrison 's supplies, sir.

589
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:56,569
There's not enough here to feed a family.
Where's the rest?

590
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,571
This is the rest, sir.

591
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:03,176
The colonel did not speak plainly to us.
The people here are starving.

592
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,854
And the fort - I feel it is under siege.

593
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:09,856
It's under siege? From whom?

594
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,771
The rebel slaves, sir.

595
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:14,977
I- I saw them off.
Dr Clive will bear witness.

596
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,972
A scouting party.
The army may be a different matter.

597
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:22,018
Then we must leave this place.
With all speed.

598
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:27,094
Or if we hold our nerve, sir,
perhaps we can turn this to our advantage.

599
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:32,137
Ready, Matthews?
On the count of three.

600
00:40:32,220 --> 00:40:34,176
One, two, three. Heave.

601
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:42,290
Thank you, Mr Wellard. Steady.

602
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,535
Ow! Watch it!

603
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:49,374
Any damage to this gun
comes out of your pay, Styles.

604
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,816
- Come on. Quickly. - I hope old
Buckland has his wits about him.

605
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:55,778
If we can pull our weight,
I dare say he can pull his.

606
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:59,614
Colonel. I'm afraid my men are all busy
about their duties,

607
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:02,612
but I would be honoured
if you would dine with me on the Renown.

608
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,691
Very gracious of you, Captain.

609
00:41:04,780 --> 00:41:08,090
What little we have is yours.
Perhaps your wife would like to join us?

610
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:12,014
She'd be delighted, sir.
And then to business.

611
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,328
Of course, Colonel.

612
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:32,377
It's all right, Sergeant,
I'll take care of the captain from here.

613
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,532
- If you're sure, Mr Hobbs.
- I'm sure.

614
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,769
But...

615
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,816
Sergeant.

616
00:41:41,620 --> 00:41:43,576
All right, Jones.

617
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:00,812
What are they up to, those lieutenants?

618
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,416
My own ship.

619
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:07,616
My own men.

620
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:10,016
The usual, sir.

621
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:12,736
Just playing at command.

622
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:23,535
All packed and ready to go, sir.

623
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:27,932
Well done. Styles, keep that head
of yours out of trouble.

624
00:42:28,020 --> 00:42:30,011
- Yes, sir.
- Styles?

625
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:33,137
- Any sign of Hobbs with that gunpowder?
- Er... no, sir.

626
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,736
Sir.

627
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:40,892
- Your orders were to remain with him.
- Very sorry, sir.

628
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,449
On deck, if you please, Mr Hobbs.

629
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,688
I said...

630
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:50,691
Off came the cage!

631
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:53,214
Up leapt the tiger.

632
00:42:53,300 --> 00:42:55,211
Stand aside.

633
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:57,211
I'm going on deck now.

634
00:42:57,300 --> 00:42:58,699
Stand aside.

635
00:42:58,780 --> 00:43:01,692
Mr Hobbs, the captain will remain
confined in his cabin.

636
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,658
- He will do no such thing.
- Think of the crew, sir.

637
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:09,336
If they were to see you now. You're
down, sir. But you still have your name.

638
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,059
My name?
What do you know of my name?

639
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:15,928
I know that once Captain James Sawyer

640
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:18,853
overcame three French frigates
in a single morning.

641
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:23,411
The men who were there that day
said they had never seen such courage.

642
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:28,530
I think he has paid the price
for that courage

643
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:30,656
and is paying for it even now.

644
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,931
You're a danger to yourself, sir,

645
00:43:37,460 --> 00:43:39,576
and I would not see you harmed.

646
00:43:46,860 --> 00:43:47,815
Sir.

647
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,090
Mr Hornblower, we must leave.

648
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,136
Now.

649
00:44:02,700 --> 00:44:04,338
Damn you.

650
00:44:10,140 --> 00:44:11,255
Ready?

651
00:44:11,980 --> 00:44:13,095
Ready, sir.

652
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:17,218
Forgive me, sir.
I have yet to congratulate you

653
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,495
on your fine work in the tunnel.

654
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,172
Thank you, Mr Hobbs.

655
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,455
Though the way you held that gun

656
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:27,089
was like you'd never fired at a man
in your life.

657
00:44:27,180 --> 00:44:29,057
Well, it had a light trigger.

658
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:33,816
Have you? Ever shot a man?

659
00:44:33,900 --> 00:44:35,413
No.

660
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,570
You might find a knife easier.

661
00:44:37,660 --> 00:44:39,537
Stab a man.

662
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,971
Especially in the back, sir.

663
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,016
That is an easy one.

664
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,376
Or just push him...

665
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,735
..down the hold.

666
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:54,812
- "Sorry about the captain."
You little snot. - I did not push him.

667
00:44:54,813 --> 00:44:57,329
Of course you did. You were so out
of your head on laudanum,

668
00:44:57,330 --> 00:44:59,300
you don 't remember a thing,
do you boy?

669
00:44:59,340 --> 00:45:01,456
KENNED Y: Mr Wellard.

670
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:03,974
We need a man to fend the gun off the cliff.

671
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,330
You were small enough for the tunnel,
Mr Wellard.

672
00:45:06,420 --> 00:45:08,695
Are you light enough to ride the gun?

673
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,291
I can do it.

674
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,938
Well done, Mr Wellard.

675
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:20,011
Hang on tight, Mr Wellard.

676
00:45:21,580 --> 00:45:23,969
I want to see you safe in Kingston.

677
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,816
Ready, all?

678
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:29,813
- Ready, sir.
- Haul away!

679
00:45:30,740 --> 00:45:33,379
- Handsomely, now.
- Heave. Heave.

680
00:45:34,460 --> 00:45:38,009
Liffing a ship's cannon
to the top of the cliff,

681
00:45:38,100 --> 00:45:40,978
under the enemy's very nose.

682
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:44,496
It was the only way of getting
within range, sir.

683
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:48,335
The Spanish ships had sailed
beyond the reach of the fort's own cannon,

684
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,411
and the bay was too shallow for the Renown.

685
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:53,458
Quite an enterprise.

686
00:45:53,540 --> 00:45:55,531
It was an opportunity, sir.

687
00:45:55,620 --> 00:45:59,295
You speak of opportunity,
yet only you seem the opportunist.

688
00:45:59,380 --> 00:46:01,371
- I don 't follow, sir.
- I think you do.

689
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:06,611
PELLEW: This piece of derring-do,
Mr Hornblower, was your idea?

690
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,736
It was authorised
by the acting captain, sir.

691
00:46:08,820 --> 00:46:10,970
And conceived by the third lieutenant?

692
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,690
Come, sir. You're under oath.
Never mind, Mr Buckland.

693
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,611
My idea, sir.

694
00:46:18,620 --> 00:46:21,214
Yes. I'll bet it was.

695
00:46:22,260 --> 00:46:24,216
Thank you, Mr Hornblower.

696
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:31,618
So how long have you been
in command, Captain Buckland?

697
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:34,459
I am the first lieutenant of
the Renown, Madam.

698
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:35,893
Captain Sawyer is indisposed.

699
00:46:35,980 --> 00:46:38,175
Oh. Not too serious, I hope.

700
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,016
Captain James Sawyer.

701
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:44,137
I did not realise we were fighting
so distinguished an adversary.

702
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,018
Yes, I'm afraid he's not quite himself.

703
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,135
A minor ailment.

704
00:46:48,220 --> 00:46:52,054
I am sorry he cannot join us.
It would be an honour.

705
00:46:52,140 --> 00:46:53,653
In due course, perhaps.

706
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:55,651
Ladies and gentlemen.

707
00:46:55,740 --> 00:46:57,696
Your health.

708
00:47:12,020 --> 00:47:13,976
Heave!

709
00:47:14,420 --> 00:47:16,376
Heave!

710
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:19,010
Keep it moving. Keep it moving.

711
00:47:19,180 --> 00:47:21,136
Heave!

712
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:24,376
Stop! Stop!

713
00:47:24,460 --> 00:47:27,338
'Vast hauling there and make secure.

714
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:31,208
- What's the matter, Mr Wellard?
- The strop, sir. It's parting.

715
00:47:31,300 --> 00:47:32,653
Styles, make me a sling.

716
00:47:32,740 --> 00:47:34,332
How much do we need, sir?

717
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:37,014
- Five fathoms should do it.
- Five fathoms, Styles.

718
00:47:38,980 --> 00:47:41,619
- You volunteering, Mr Hornblower?
- I am, sir.

719
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:53,257
- It's a good knot for the job, sir.
- Yes. Thank you, Styles.

720
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,816
- All right, are you, Horatio?
- Yes, thank you, Archie.

721
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:05,496
I remember when you used to be
scared of heights, Mr Hornblower.

722
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:07,889
Nothing's changed, Mr Kennedy.

723
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:16,213
- They say one should do what one dislikes.
- Oh, yes?

724
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,690
When I was a boy I had to eat turnips.

725
00:48:19,780 --> 00:48:21,930
Eat them now, do you?

726
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:23,976
Never touch them.

727
00:48:25,060 --> 00:48:28,097
Come on! Ortega won 't wait all day.

728
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,257
Sir. Help me.

729
00:48:38,340 --> 00:48:40,296
Hold on, Mr Wellard.

730
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:45,854
The young officer - Mr Hornblower.

731
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,977
- A man of promise, I suppose?
- I hope we are all men of promise.

732
00:48:49,060 --> 00:48:54,134
Of course, but young officers
have such schemes and such little experience.

733
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,575
- Yes, I am with you there.
- More wine, sir?

734
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:04,129
Sawyer: (sing)We'll rank and we'll roar
like true British sailors

735
00:49:04,220 --> 00:49:06,131
(sing) We'll rank and we'll roar...

736
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:08,131
If you'll excuse me.

737
00:49:08,220 --> 00:49:13,135
(sing) Until we strike soundings
in the channel of Old England

738
00:49:14,060 --> 00:49:17,052
(sing) From...

739
00:49:17,140 --> 00:49:19,495
(sing) Ushant to Scilly

740
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:22,095
(sing) Tis 35 leagues...

741
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,496
No, sir!

742
00:49:40,860 --> 00:49:44,250
There you are.
I told you. We won 't let you down.

743
00:49:44,340 --> 00:49:45,409
Thank you.

744
00:49:46,340 --> 00:49:49,889
Sir? Have you ever done something
and forgot you did it?

745
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:51,891
All the time.

746
00:49:51,980 --> 00:49:53,936
Now fend off.

747
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:56,896
Haul away, there!

748
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,255
Heave! Heave!

749
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:03,256
Heave!

750
00:50:03,820 --> 00:50:05,936
(sing) Farewell and adieu

751
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,090
(sing) To you Spanish ladies

752
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,091
(sing) Farewell and adieu...

753
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,136
It is your choice, sir.

754
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,292
I thought you were with me.

755
00:50:18,380 --> 00:50:20,336
I was ever my own man.

756
00:50:23,140 --> 00:50:25,893
If I could cure you,
even now, I would.

757
00:50:27,740 --> 00:50:29,696
But you have fallen too far.

758
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:32,096
Now, I beg you.

759
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:34,291
No more singing.

760
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:37,257
(sing) We'll rant and we'll roar
- As you wish.

761
00:50:37,340 --> 00:50:39,376
(sing) Like true British sailors

762
00:50:39,820 --> 00:50:41,651
(sing) Like true British sailors

763
00:50:42,380 --> 00:50:44,575
(sing) We'll rant and we'll roar

764
00:51:00,460 --> 00:51:02,098
- Ready, Mr Hobbs?
- Aye aye, sir.

765
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,694
Your officers, where are they, sir?

766
00:51:04,780 --> 00:51:06,816
Colonel, I must protest.

767
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,015
I know when a man is deceiving me,
First Lieutenant.

768
00:51:11,100 --> 00:51:13,933
I assure you, Colonel,
whatever may happen on dry land,

769
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,295
we in His Majesty's navy
are men of honour, sir.

770
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,655
Whatever you may think of us,
we are men of our word. And...

771
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:20,696
(Cannon shot)

772
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:25,055
Ah.

773
00:51:25,140 --> 00:51:27,779
- What is this?
- Ranging shot, Colonel.

774
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:29,498
On whose ships?

775
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:31,457
Yours, Colonel.

776
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:33,451
What?!

777
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:35,496
You!

778
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:44,538
You know, Dr Clive,
I actually think we might be winning.

779
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,455
50 yards short, Mr Hornblower.

780
00:51:55,540 --> 00:51:57,451
Aye aye, sir.

781
00:51:57,540 --> 00:52:00,771
- Right. Full charge, Mr Hobbs.
- Full charge, it is.

782
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:11,376
Mr Buckland!

783
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,335
Do you realise what you're doing?

784
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:16,934
- Without our ships...
- You have no escape.

785
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:19,170
Either from us or the rebel army.

786
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:22,218
And in all probability
will be dead by the end of the week.

787
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,849
Be not aggrieved, madam. You and your
husband had no less a fate in store for us.

788
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,851
This is madness.

789
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:32,216
Fear not, Colonel.
Your ships are safe, if you wish it.

790
00:52:32,300 --> 00:52:34,256
As British prizes of war.

791
00:52:35,260 --> 00:52:40,050
And may I humbly extend to you
an offer of safe passage to Kingston,
Jamaica,

792
00:52:40,140 --> 00:52:42,131
as His Majesty's prisoners?

793
00:52:42,220 --> 00:52:44,131
- Sergeant.
- Sir.

794
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,576
Colonel. Your sword, if you please.

795
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:56,816
PELLEW: A complete surrender.

796
00:52:56,900 --> 00:52:59,573
No mean achievement for a first lieutenant.

797
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:00,888
Thank you, Commodore.

798
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:04,416
Pity you weren 't able to
savour your triumph.

799
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:07,572
- Sir?
- The rebel slaves, Mr Buckland.

800
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:09,810
They already had the island in their grasp.

801
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:12,016
But you'd already encountered them.

802
00:53:12,100 --> 00:53:15,674
It was a desperate affair, sir.
One of our boats was stolen,

803
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:17,979
two of our men taken hostage.

804
00:53:17,980 --> 00:53:20,016
One had no inkling of what
lay behind it.

805
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:21,852
So you fired on them.

806
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,613
And in hindsight it was unfortunate.

807
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,736
In hindsight it was a blunder, sir,

808
00:53:26,820 --> 00:53:31,848
that later made short work of
your fine victory, and cost lives.

809
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:35,449
I regret the loss of life.

810
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:40,573
They're striking their colours.

811
00:53:40,660 --> 00:53:42,571
(Cheering)

812
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,696
Come, gentlemen. Our battle is done.

813
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,255
Sir!

814
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,974
Who the hell is that?

815
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,176
Horatio.

816
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,698
I have an idea our battle has just begun.

817
00:54:21,460 --> 00:54:23,576
I for one won 't give up without a fight.

818
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:27,096
Sir, a retreat might be more prudent.
We're only 20 men.

819
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:29,655
Not quite 20.

820
00:54:29,740 --> 00:54:32,413
Very well, fall back.
Hobbs, spike the gun.

821
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:34,456
Aye aye, sir.

822
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:48,088
How long have you been under siege?

823
00:54:50,140 --> 00:54:52,654
Longer than I care to remember, sir.

824
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,856
Then why are they attacking now?

825
00:54:57,180 --> 00:55:01,458
(Captain Sawyer sings)
- Oh, for God's sake. What now?

826
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,176
(sing) Spanish ladies

827
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:06,171
(sing) Farewell and adieu

828
00:55:06,260 --> 00:55:08,854
(sing) You ladies of Spain

829
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:11,454
(sing) For we've received orders

830
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,690
(sing) To go to Old England...

831
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:16,616
Sir!

832
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:18,656
Stop this madness.

833
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,857
Ah. The acting captain.

834
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:23,771
- So glad you're here.
- Sir?

835
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,693
When I see you
I feel so much less pity for myself.

836
00:55:26,780 --> 00:55:28,213
You are not well, sir.

837
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:30,734
No. I am not well.

838
00:55:31,540 --> 00:55:35,169
But you are outstripped
by a boy half your age.

839
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:37,171
So clever.

840
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:39,171
So quick.

841
00:55:39,260 --> 00:55:41,171
So full of invention.

842
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,535
The doctor will settle you, sir.

843
00:55:43,620 --> 00:55:47,693
Less than seven years at sea
and the men love him already.

844
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:50,419
Of course they do. He commands.

845
00:55:52,060 --> 00:55:57,578
It is in him. Not hammered home
like some dull school lesson.

846
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,931
And the more he shines,

847
00:56:00,020 --> 00:56:02,659
the more they smile at you.
Yes, sir.

848
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:07,299
They smile and nod,
and laugh behind their hands.

849
00:56:07,860 --> 00:56:10,613
You are a clown, sir.

850
00:56:12,140 --> 00:56:14,813
A clown in a captain 's hat.

851
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:19,453
Take my advice. Strike first, Mr Buckland.

852
00:56:19,540 --> 00:56:24,170
Or he will take your ship
and you'll be dead before you know it.

853
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:26,216
Then what will you do, Mr Buckland?

854
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:30,088
- The boat is ready to take you ashore, sir.
- For God's sake, give him what he needs.

855
00:56:30,180 --> 00:56:32,330
I've already given him as much as I dare.

856
00:56:32,420 --> 00:56:33,455
Strike first.

857
00:56:33,540 --> 00:56:35,496
Then give it again!

858
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:39,896
PELLEW: I don 't envy you, sir.

859
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:43,052
The captain injured,
the first lieutenant takes command.

860
00:56:43,140 --> 00:56:45,051
Never an easy thing in any circumstances.

861
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:46,971
We strive to do our best.

862
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:50,370
Tell me, how would you describe
your third lieutenant?

863
00:56:50,460 --> 00:56:52,416
Mr Hornblower?

864
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,777
I would say
he has a precocious talent, sir.

865
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:00,769
That's certainly one way of looking at it.

866
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:03,055
Nevertheless, you worked well together?

867
00:57:03,140 --> 00:57:06,894
- I would say so. Yes.
-No hint of discord or threat?

868
00:57:06,980 --> 00:57:09,050
There was nothing of that, sir.

869
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:11,969
Really?

870
00:57:12,060 --> 00:57:14,016
Come on!

871
00:57:15,100 --> 00:57:18,297
Matthews, get me the captain of Marines
and let's organise a defence.

872
00:57:18,380 --> 00:57:20,018
Aye aye, sir.

873
00:57:20,100 --> 00:57:21,613
How long do we have, Mr Hornblower?

874
00:57:23,860 --> 00:57:25,851
I think you have your answer, Mr Kennedy.

875
00:57:42,260 --> 00:57:45,855
- We're withdrawing from the fort, sir.
- The Marines will cover our retreat.

876
00:57:45,940 --> 00:57:47,055
Very well.

877
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:48,858
Time we made it to the ship, sir.

878
00:57:48,940 --> 00:57:53,172
I don 't think so, Mr Bush.
We still have to blow up the fort.

879
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:57,251
Ineed a man to lay the charges.

880
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:05,533
I would be honoured to volunteer, sir.

881
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,412
And l, sir.

882
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:15,573
- I'm the senior officer.
- I don 't think it will take all 3 of you.

883
00:58:15,660 --> 00:58:17,696
Mr Hornblower, I accept your offer.

884
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:19,657
With respect, sir...

885
00:58:20,780 --> 00:58:22,099
what's to be gained?

886
00:58:22,180 --> 00:58:25,934
Those are our orders, Mr Kennedy.
I'm sure Mr Hornblower will concur.

887
00:58:26,020 --> 00:58:27,897
Yes, sir.

888
00:58:29,180 --> 00:58:30,738
Very well.

889
00:58:32,220 --> 00:58:34,176
Good luck, Mr Hornblower.

890
00:58:38,060 --> 00:58:39,175
Horatio.

891
00:58:39,260 --> 00:58:41,216
Archie.

892
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:44,816
Sir.

893
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:49,530
Mr Hornblower.

894
00:58:52,700 --> 00:58:55,214
I shall see you onboard the Renown,
gentlemen.

895
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:05,456
Get those prisoners below.

896
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,496
(Women complain in Spanish)

897
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:13,450
Let's have some more order here.

898
00:59:13,540 --> 00:59:17,328
- Beg pardon, sir. About Mr Hornblower.
- What about him?

899
00:59:17,420 --> 00:59:21,049
Me and Styles, some of the lads thought we
could row back, take him off, sir.

900
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:23,734
No, I can 't spare you.
I've lost enough men as it is.

901
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:26,653
- But he's on his own, sir.
-No. I said no!

902
00:59:26,740 --> 00:59:28,378
You're needed here.

903
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:31,020
Where is Mr Kennedy?
Where is Mr Bush?

904
00:59:34,740 --> 00:59:36,776
Archie! Are you out of your mind?

905
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:40,011
Very possibly,
but we thought you could use the company.

906
00:59:40,700 --> 00:59:42,656
Mr Hornblower.

907
00:59:43,900 --> 00:59:46,209
You've clearly lost your wits, both of you.

908
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:48,135
Aargh.

909
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:52,099
I suggest we our move, gentlemen.
It's getting rather warm down here.

910
00:59:57,300 --> 00:59:59,211
This way!

911
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,256
No. No.

912
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:03,856
This way! I assure you.

913
01:00:24,100 --> 01:00:26,978
Now you know what it's like
to lose your hero.

914
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,450
- He'll be back.
- Of course he will.

915
01:00:32,780 --> 01:00:34,736
Well, I admire your faith.

916
01:00:36,020 --> 01:00:38,454
Your victory's now complete, sir.

917
01:00:38,540 --> 01:00:40,451
Yes.

918
01:00:40,540 --> 01:00:42,451
Mr Matthews.

919
01:00:42,540 --> 01:00:44,496
We sail for Kingston.

920
01:00:45,740 --> 01:00:46,695
Aye aye, sir.

921
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:49,010
Gybe-ho!

922
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:52,814
Sir.

923
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:54,572
What?

924
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:56,173
The cliff top, sir.

925
01:00:56,660 --> 01:00:58,616
She's sailing away.

926
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:05,819
Well, that looks like it, gentlemen.

927
01:01:07,340 --> 01:01:09,171
No, it isn 't, Mr Bush.

928
01:01:09,260 --> 01:01:10,215
Archie.

929
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:12,572
I'm afraid I think you're right.

930
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:14,571
- What?
- We're going to jump.

931
01:01:15,700 --> 01:01:17,656
Well, now who's out of his mind?

932
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,651
See for yourself, Mr Bush.

933
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,776
It's only water.
You won 't break anything.

934
01:01:21,860 --> 01:01:23,816
Really?

935
01:01:24,140 --> 01:01:26,779
Come. Easier than eating turnips.
Mr Kennedy.

936
01:01:27,620 --> 01:01:30,692
-No. I'm sorry. Gentlemen, no.
- On the count of three. One, two...

937
01:01:30,780 --> 01:01:33,294
We're not going to jump.
That's my final word.

938
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:35,336
And three. And ru-u-un!

939
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:39,329
BUSH: I can 't swim-m-m-m!

940
01:01:44,420 --> 01:01:46,376
Privilege of rank, Styles.

941
01:01:51,820 --> 01:01:53,776
I can 't swim!

942
01:01:55,620 --> 01:01:58,054
- It's all right, Mr Bush. We've got you.
- Come on.

943
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:00,051
They're up!

944
01:02:00,140 --> 01:02:00,890
Yes!

945
01:02:00,980 --> 01:02:02,936
(Cheering)

946
01:02:07,460 --> 01:02:09,849
All right to lower a boat now, sir?

947
01:02:11,380 --> 01:02:14,736
So, Mr Buckland, the destruction of the fort?

948
01:02:14,820 --> 01:02:17,254
Did you expect Mr Hornblower to survive it?

949
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:20,093
- Of course.
- Did you want him to survive it?

950
01:02:20,180 --> 01:02:22,739
-I resent that, sir.
-With respect, I must object

951
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,896
to this accusation
which has no bearing on the charges.

952
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:27,811
Your objection is noted.

953
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,813
Resent it or resent it not,
did you want Mr Hornblower to survive?

954
01:02:34,660 --> 01:02:37,299
I do not send men to their deaths, sir.

955
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:40,498
Give them a cheer, lads! Hip, hip...

956
01:02:40,580 --> 01:02:42,536
CREW: Hoorah!

957
01:02:42,620 --> 01:02:44,212
- Hip, hip!
- Hoorah!

958
01:02:44,380 --> 01:02:46,291
- Hip, hip.
- Hoorah!

959
01:02:46,380 --> 01:02:48,291
Mr Kennedy. Well done, sir.

960
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:51,690
- Thank you very much, Mr Wellard.
- And another! Hoorah!

961
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:54,216
Mr Matthews.

962
01:02:57,940 --> 01:02:59,817
Got your head for heights, have you, sir?

963
01:02:59,900 --> 01:03:02,209
It wasn 't needed on the way down, Styles.

964
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:04,256
(Laughs)

965
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:08,736
I hope you are equally
as pleased to see me, Styles.

966
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:13,051
Sir, he's lost for words,
he's that chuffed.

967
01:03:16,420 --> 01:03:18,490
Come on! Race up those yards!

968
01:03:18,580 --> 01:03:20,536
Mr Hornblower.

969
01:03:24,660 --> 01:03:27,538
Kindly take command of the Gaditana
and the other prize vessels.

970
01:03:27,620 --> 01:03:30,851
- Yes, sir.  - I hold you responsible
for their safe return.

971
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:33,609
All of them. Is that clear?

972
01:03:33,700 --> 01:03:35,656
Aye aye, sir.

973
01:03:42,300 --> 01:03:43,858
No, no, no.

974
01:03:44,300 --> 01:03:46,052
Best, it's me.

975
01:03:46,500 --> 01:03:48,411
Sir, my apologies.

976
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:50,419
Oh?

977
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:52,138
For disobeying your orders.

978
01:03:52,220 --> 01:03:55,292
Well, it was true to form, if nothing else.

979
01:03:56,420 --> 01:03:58,809
You three, you are so full of yourselves.

980
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:00,856
And of each other.

981
01:04:02,980 --> 01:04:04,936
You think me a fool.

982
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:06,851
Nobody pretends command is easy, sir.

983
01:04:06,940 --> 01:04:09,534
I never expected it to be easy.

984
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,656
I expected to be fit for it.

985
01:04:19,100 --> 01:04:21,056
(MUTTERS )

986
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:27,456
What in God's name...?

987
01:04:32,020 --> 01:04:33,738
Captain James Sawyer, sir.

988
01:04:33,820 --> 01:04:35,731
I apologise I am unable to salute you.

989
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:38,812
- How long has he been like this?
- Since he last had his medicine, sir.

990
01:04:42,380 --> 01:04:43,972
- Release him.
- Sir?

991
01:04:44,060 --> 01:04:46,130
Just...do it.

992
01:04:46,220 --> 01:04:47,573
Sir.

993
01:05:05,620 --> 01:05:07,929
I didn 't think I'd ever see these again.

994
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:11,936
(Chuckles)

995
01:05:17,700 --> 01:05:20,294
lnever wanted any of this.

996
01:05:21,380 --> 01:05:23,336
Do you hear?

997
01:05:35,020 --> 01:05:36,976
(Sawyer sobs)

998
01:05:39,980 --> 01:05:41,936
Some fresh air, sir?

999
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:50,731
All quiet, Matthews?

1000
01:06:50,820 --> 01:06:52,731
As a church, sir.

1001
01:06:52,820 --> 01:06:54,731
Well, I for one am glad of it.

1002
01:06:54,820 --> 01:06:57,892
I dare say you are, sir,
with Mr Buckland on your back.

1003
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:59,857
- (Reproving) Matthews.
- Sorry, sir.

1004
01:07:01,180 --> 01:07:05,219
But affer what's happened today,
I'd say he was a man with no conscience.

1005
01:07:06,180 --> 01:07:10,014
It's no simple matter
commanding a vessel of over 700 souls.

1006
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:13,695
The captain must rely on
the courtesy of his crew.

1007
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:15,776
Aye. I see that, sir.

1008
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,731
But what of Captain Sawyer?

1009
01:07:20,220 --> 01:07:22,734
Should we look to our conscience there?

1010
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:27,056
Yes. Yes. Even there.

1011
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:32,214
Why don 't I take first watch, sir?
You get some rest. You look done in.

1012
01:07:32,300 --> 01:07:35,451
Thank you, Matthews.
Wake me at six bells.

1013
01:07:56,420 --> 01:08:01,210
Watch your step. We don 't want you
falling down there a second time, do we, sir?

1014
01:08:01,300 --> 01:08:03,256
No.

1015
01:08:09,100 --> 01:08:11,011
Tell me.

1016
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:13,056
What do you see?

1017
01:08:20,460 --> 01:08:22,416
Spanish ladies.

1018
01:08:30,940 --> 01:08:32,896
All gone now.

1019
01:08:39,220 --> 01:08:41,131
What else?

1020
01:08:41,220 --> 01:08:43,131
What else do you see?

1021
01:08:43,220 --> 01:08:45,131
Leave him, Mr Hobbs.

1022
01:08:45,220 --> 01:08:47,176
His mind is gone.

1023
01:08:48,380 --> 01:08:50,177
Oh, you'd hope so.

1024
01:08:50,260 --> 01:08:51,852
You of all men.

1025
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:54,249
I didn 't push him. You're mistaken.

1026
01:08:54,340 --> 01:08:57,377
No. It wasn 't him. Too small.

1027
01:08:57,460 --> 01:09:00,418
Give me a minute. I'll remember his name.

1028
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,298
You, sir! You! I know your face.

1029
01:09:10,820 --> 01:09:13,812
You are...Admiral de Brueys.

1030
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:16,972
No. He died long ago.

1031
01:09:17,060 --> 01:09:18,971
Cut in two.

1032
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:21,016
Lying on the arms box.

1033
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:25,855
Better take the captain
back to his cabin, Hobbs.

1034
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:29,016
I will, sir.

1035
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:32,695
But when the captain is rested,

1036
01:09:32,780 --> 01:09:34,736
and his mind is clear,

1037
01:09:35,620 --> 01:09:37,497
I will bring him back.

1038
01:09:37,580 --> 01:09:40,970
And I will ask him again,
and he will remember.

1039
01:09:41,060 --> 01:09:44,018
If not today, then tomorrow.

1040
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:46,011
Or the day affer that.

1041
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:49,849
Sir.

1042
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:11,011
Habla espanol?

1043
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:12,849
No.

1044
01:10:15,940 --> 01:10:17,896
Quieres joderme, hm?

1045
01:10:19,700 --> 01:10:21,258
Pero...

1046
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,256
Te voy a matar.

1047
01:10:47,700 --> 01:10:50,055
WELLARD: I think Mr Hobbs is right.

1048
01:10:50,140 --> 01:10:53,177
I think the captain may name
the man who pushed him.

1049
01:10:53,260 --> 01:10:55,410
(Sighs) Even if it's Admiral de Brueys.

1050
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:59,132
You've nothing to fear
from the noose, Mr Wellard.

1051
01:10:59,220 --> 01:11:01,495
I've no fears on my account, sir,

1052
01:11:01,580 --> 01:11:04,617
but I owe a great debt
to two men on this ship.

1053
01:11:04,700 --> 01:11:07,055
I would do anything to repay it.

1054
01:11:07,140 --> 01:11:09,779
What are you suggesting, Mr Wellard?

1055
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:16,217
I cannot tell who pushed the captain, sir,

1056
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:19,337
but I know there were three of us down here.

1057
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,376
Any one of us could have done it.

1058
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:23,371
And one of us will hang for it.

1059
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:05,736
Shan 't sleep.

1060
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,416
Shan 't sleep.

1061
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:32,816
Now I remember.

1062
01:13:02,740 --> 01:13:04,696
Vamos! Sssh.

1063
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:14,976
All quiet?

1064
01:13:24,780 --> 01:13:26,736
(Urgent whispering)

1065
01:13:39,060 --> 01:13:42,018
Vamos! Apuranos. Silencio.

1066
01:13:49,980 --> 01:13:51,891
Tie him to the bed.

1067
01:13:51,980 --> 01:13:55,814
- By God, sir. I'm a fellow officer.
-No. You were never that.

1068
01:14:11,100 --> 01:14:13,056
Renowns! We're taken!

1069
01:14:15,020 --> 01:14:16,976
This way.

1070
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:25,137
All hands! All hands!

1071
01:14:26,020 --> 01:14:27,976
Every man on deck!

1072
01:14:28,060 --> 01:14:29,209
(Gunfire)

1073
01:14:29,300 --> 01:14:32,690
Sorry to wake you, sir.
I thought you should see for yourself.

1074
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,331
All hands on deck. Quickly now.

1075
01:14:35,420 --> 01:14:37,376
All hands on deck!

1076
01:15:15,020 --> 01:15:19,650
Shortly affer eight bells
the French frigates opened fire.

1077
01:15:20,580 --> 01:15:23,094
We were outnumbered and outgunned,

1078
01:15:23,180 --> 01:15:25,569
having lost half our men already.

1079
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:31,094
But in the hours that followed
we regained our advantage and...

1080
01:15:34,020 --> 01:15:35,419
I can 't let you remember.

1081
01:15:35,500 --> 01:15:37,456
I can 't let you get to Kingston.

1082
01:15:38,820 --> 01:15:41,459
And I will not see them hang.
Either of them.

1083
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:53,533
Then you'd best use both hands,
if you want to pull the trigger.

1084
01:15:54,620 --> 01:15:56,292
Take her alongside, Matthews.

1085
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:57,733
Aye aye, sir.

1086
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:05,178
Stand by to board!

1087
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:10,576
Captain Sawyer, sir.

1088
01:16:13,980 --> 01:16:15,936
Hobbs, the enemy is here!

1089
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:26,376
(Cheering)

1090
01:16:27,460 --> 01:16:29,416
Renowns, to me!

1091
01:16:34,220 --> 01:16:38,293
It's a clumsy weapon for any man.
No use at all for a boy like you.

1092
01:16:38,380 --> 01:16:39,779
Don 't call me boy.

1093
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:42,932
Oh? What would you have me call you?

1094
01:16:43,020 --> 01:16:44,055
Coward?

1095
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:46,051
I'm no boy, sir.

1096
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,449
And I am no coward.

1097
01:16:48,540 --> 01:16:52,499
And I'm no scarecrow that has to be tied up
so he don 't bite his own shadow...sir.

1098
01:16:58,060 --> 01:16:59,539
See?

1099
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:01,531
I'm no boy.

1100
01:17:01,620 --> 01:17:04,054
And you are no man at all to strike me so.

1101
01:17:05,580 --> 01:17:06,490
No.

1102
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:08,536
To me, Renowns!

1103
01:17:21,660 --> 01:17:22,934
- Mr Wellard.
- Sir?

1104
01:17:23,020 --> 01:17:24,738
I know who pushed me.

1105
01:17:24,820 --> 01:17:28,051
Here. At least one of us can face the enemy
with a clear head.

1106
01:17:28,500 --> 01:17:30,411
Abre la puerta! Abre la puerta!

1107
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:32,092
Mr Wellard.

1108
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:33,613
Abre! Aaargh!

1109
01:17:33,700 --> 01:17:34,974
Fire!

1110
01:17:36,420 --> 01:17:38,376
Brave lad.

1111
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:19,577
Do you surrender? The colonel is dead.

1112
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,616
Marines, present!

1113
01:18:36,820 --> 01:18:38,776
Throw down your weapons.

1114
01:18:38,860 --> 01:18:40,896
Rindan las armas.

1115
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:48,528
- Matthews, take them below.
- Aye aye, sir.

1116
01:18:48,620 --> 01:18:51,532
Below, with you!
Come on. Get them below.

1117
01:18:57,340 --> 01:18:59,296
Thank you, Styles.

1118
01:19:00,140 --> 01:19:02,096
I fear I'm done.

1119
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:06,051
Not in a thousand years.

1120
01:19:06,140 --> 01:19:08,654
Sir! Mr Bush.

1121
01:19:10,860 --> 01:19:12,771
How is he?

1122
01:19:12,860 --> 01:19:17,217
He doesn 't need any help from you.
He needs needle and thread. Out of my way.

1123
01:19:17,300 --> 01:19:19,097
You did your work. Let me do mine.

1124
01:19:19,180 --> 01:19:21,774
Yes, sir. You're right.
Come on, Styles.

1125
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:28,649
He recovered at the last, did he?

1126
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:33,012
He said I was brave.

1127
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:35,252
You are.

1128
01:19:37,420 --> 01:19:39,376
He knew.

1129
01:19:39,660 --> 01:19:41,616
He knew who pushed him.

1130
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:44,134
Get it off your chest. Tell me.

1131
01:19:53,180 --> 01:19:54,738
Mr Hobbs.

1132
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:10,417
I'm sorry that his last command
was taken away from him...

1133
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:13,456
..but he was a leader of men.

1134
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:16,176
And he died in battle.

1135
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:19,176
It's all over now, sir.

1136
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:23,216
All over.

1137
01:20:33,900 --> 01:20:35,856
(Groans)

1138
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:38,495
- Are you hurt, sir?
- Can you see any blood?

1139
01:20:39,460 --> 01:20:42,497
The prizes are safe, sir,
and Renown is recovered.

1140
01:20:42,580 --> 01:20:45,333
I can see it's recovered
and I can see who recovered it!

1141
01:20:57,780 --> 01:20:59,736
I heard about Buckland.

1142
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:02,491
(Laughs) Silly old fool.

1143
01:21:02,580 --> 01:21:04,491
Let him be, Archie.

1144
01:21:04,580 --> 01:21:06,536
Had you seen him as I did...

1145
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:09,536
Is that your blood?

1146
01:21:09,620 --> 01:21:12,214
Oh. It's just a scratch.

1147
01:21:13,420 --> 01:21:15,536
Prisoners under lock and key...

1148
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,456
I said, is that your blood?

1149
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:24,373
Archie...

1150
01:21:26,740 --> 01:21:28,696
Not as bad it looks.

1151
01:21:55,260 --> 01:21:57,216
Horatio.

1152
01:22:02,420 --> 01:22:05,218
And so, Mr Buckland, under your command

1153
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:09,339
misfortune was, for a brief spell,
turned to advantage.

1154
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:11,696
And then what?

1155
01:22:11,780 --> 01:22:13,259
Sir?

1156
01:22:13,340 --> 01:22:18,334
A ship of the line fallen into
prisoners' hands. A calamity, sir.

1157
01:22:18,420 --> 01:22:21,059
While this fellow lay dreaming in his bed.

1158
01:22:21,140 --> 01:22:22,858
(Laughter)

1159
01:22:22,940 --> 01:22:27,650
I fear it will be your epitaph.
'Here lies Buckland of the Renown,

1160
01:22:27,740 --> 01:22:29,571
the captain who was caught napping.'

1161
01:22:29,660 --> 01:22:31,616
(Raucous laughter)

1162
01:22:40,820 --> 01:22:43,209
Thankfully, there was at least
one fellow officer...

1163
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:45,291
You speak of Mr Hornblower!

1164
01:22:45,380 --> 01:22:48,736
- Well, I'll tell you something, Commodore.
- Have a care, sir.

1165
01:22:48,820 --> 01:22:50,412
The reason I'm here

1166
01:22:50,500 --> 01:22:53,810
is because Captain Sawyer was
mentally incapable of commanding a vessel!

1167
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:54,650
Enough!

1168
01:22:54,740 --> 01:22:57,777
He endangered the lives
of every man on board that ship.

1169
01:22:57,860 --> 01:23:01,455
I charge you, sir, do not blacken the name
of one of Nelson 's own.

1170
01:23:01,540 --> 01:23:03,929
- Damn you, sir. I will speak!
- Sir!

1171
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:07,456
Captain Sawyer was unfit to command
for one reason only.

1172
01:23:07,540 --> 01:23:11,055
He didn 't fall into that hold.
He was pushed!

1173
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:13,574
- What?
- By whom, sir?

1174
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:16,618
By Lieutenant Horatio Hornblower!

1175
01:23:20,660 --> 01:23:23,094
Is there anyone else
who can support this claim?

1176
01:23:24,860 --> 01:23:26,418
Yes.

1177
01:23:27,380 --> 01:23:29,336
I believe there is.

1178
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:40,736
A kiss from me.

1179
01:23:43,300 --> 01:23:45,256
Judas.

1180
01:24:01,060 --> 01:24:02,971
(Sniffs)

1181
01:24:03,060 --> 01:24:04,971
No sign of mortification.

1182
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:09,292
Nothing like a good, clean cut
stitched up in its own blood.

1183
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:11,536
(Gasps)

1184
01:24:13,300 --> 01:24:15,256
(Coughs)

1185
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:20,491
You'll mend, Mr Bush.

1186
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:22,536
You'll mend.

1187
01:24:26,460 --> 01:24:28,371
You know why you're here.

1188
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:31,770
To corroborate the evidence of Mr Buckland.

1189
01:24:31,860 --> 01:24:33,771
I do, sir.

1190
01:24:34,460 --> 01:24:37,770
I'd have gone through hellfire
for Captain Sawyer.

1191
01:24:37,860 --> 01:24:39,771
Yes. Yes.

1192
01:24:40,660 --> 01:24:42,890
In my book he was equal to Nelson himself.

1193
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:45,255
Nelson. Yes.

1194
01:24:45,340 --> 01:24:48,138
But to the matter at hand, Mr Hobbs.

1195
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:48,936
Sir.

1196
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:51,497
Who pushed him?

1197
01:24:51,580 --> 01:24:54,413
Who pushed your captain into the hold?

1198
01:24:56,860 --> 01:24:58,816
My captain...

1199
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,411
was a leader of men

1200
01:25:04,500 --> 01:25:06,456
and he died in battle.

1201
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:11,492
But I'm afraid
I cannot tell you who pushed him.

1202
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:13,536
(Murmuring)

1203
01:25:15,900 --> 01:25:16,855
Sir.

1204
01:25:32,380 --> 01:25:36,532
Gentlemen, I'm asking you
to halt this court martial,

1205
01:25:36,700 --> 01:25:41,216
and save the life of a man willing
to abandon his own life for others.

1206
01:25:41,300 --> 01:25:45,339
A man for whom others
would gladly give their own lives.

1207
01:25:47,260 --> 01:25:49,649
We should not try to hang this man.

1208
01:25:50,260 --> 01:25:52,216
We should promote him.

1209
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:57,976
Captain Hammond?

1210
01:25:58,380 --> 01:26:02,259
Well, where the commodore leads,
we must all gladly follow.

1211
01:26:03,820 --> 01:26:07,779
But, sir, this "heroic" young man,

1212
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:10,896
I confess I fear for him.

1213
01:26:12,460 --> 01:26:14,655
Mr Buckland has slandered him.

1214
01:26:14,740 --> 01:26:18,415
So, for his own sake,
we cannot let the insult stand.

1215
01:26:18,500 --> 01:26:21,298
We must put the question to him,
and make an end of it.

1216
01:26:21,380 --> 01:26:23,257
Did he push the captain down the hold?

1217
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,171
And, as a man of honour,

1218
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:28,216
he will answer it.

1219
01:26:36,980 --> 01:26:38,936
Mr Kennedy, who am l?

1220
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:42,816
You're Clive, you great fool.

1221
01:26:42,900 --> 01:26:45,289
Very well, Mr Kennedy.

1222
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:50,932
Horatio.

1223
01:26:52,020 --> 01:26:54,295
Don 't overtire him, Mr Hornblower.

1224
01:26:55,260 --> 01:26:57,216
Well, I must leave you.

1225
01:26:58,340 --> 01:27:00,296
Um...

1226
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:03,376
I wish you the very best.

1227
01:27:07,900 --> 01:27:09,856
Thank you, Dr Clive.

1228
01:27:17,860 --> 01:27:19,976
When are you due back in court?

1229
01:27:20,060 --> 01:27:23,814
Tomorrow. The court adjourned
to give me more time to consider
my testimony.

1230
01:27:23,900 --> 01:27:28,098
And when they ask you,
'Did you push Captain Sawyer into the hold?'

1231
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:30,694
- Are you asking me that question now?
- I am not.

1232
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:34,932
Then I will answer it when the time comes.
Until then I see no reason to speculate.

1233
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:39,096
(Cock crows)

1234
01:27:43,940 --> 01:27:45,896
- Right you are.
- One, two.

1235
01:27:52,020 --> 01:27:53,976
Where is he?

1236
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:57,096
Oh, he's up and about.

1237
01:28:05,140 --> 01:28:07,131
Call the next witness.

1238
01:28:11,180 --> 01:28:13,136
MAN : It's Mr Kennedy!

1239
01:28:49,100 --> 01:28:51,694
I was hoping to see him before
I was recalled.

1240
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:54,736
And see him you shall.

1241
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:03,176
Where is he?

1242
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:06,138
Wait. Wait, man. Wait. Wait. It must be done.

1243
01:29:06,220 --> 01:29:08,176
No. Marine!

1244
01:29:10,740 --> 01:29:12,378
I alone pushed him.

1245
01:29:12,460 --> 01:29:14,132
(Shouting)

1246
01:29:17,300 --> 01:29:20,497
I alone pushed Captain Sawyer into the hold.

1247
01:29:20,580 --> 01:29:23,413
I think we've heard enough, gentlemen.

1248
01:29:23,900 --> 01:29:25,538
Take this man down!

1249
01:29:27,420 --> 01:29:28,819
(Shouting continues)

1250
01:29:28,900 --> 01:29:30,458
Silence!

1251
01:29:31,940 --> 01:29:33,532
Silence!

1252
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:57,256
(Knocking)
- Mr Buckland.

1253
01:29:57,900 --> 01:29:59,811
Mr Buckland, sir!

1254
01:29:59,900 --> 01:30:04,132
Mr Buckland, are you all right
in there, sir?

1255
01:30:21,380 --> 01:30:23,336
Take as long as you like.

1256
01:30:46,820 --> 01:30:47,775
Why?

1257
01:30:47,860 --> 01:30:49,816
Look at me.

1258
01:30:50,420 --> 01:30:53,617
There isn 't a gallows in the world
can touch me now.

1259
01:30:53,700 --> 01:30:55,611
Archie.

1260
01:30:55,700 --> 01:30:57,895
It doesn 't hurt, Horatio.

1261
01:30:57,980 --> 01:30:59,936
Don 't let them say it hurts.

1262
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:06,698
But...I am frightened.

1263
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:10,213
You're the bravest man I know, Archie.

1264
01:31:10,300 --> 01:31:12,256
A little prone to panic.

1265
01:31:12,980 --> 01:31:17,929
Archie, you're the one who jumped off a cliff
with a man who can 't swim,

1266
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:20,818
and another who's afraid of heights.

1267
01:31:20,900 --> 01:31:23,130
(Laughs) So I am.

1268
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:25,176
No panic then.

1269
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:27,656
And none now.

1270
01:31:30,500 --> 01:31:34,288
And none when you stood up in court
and took the blame.

1271
01:31:34,380 --> 01:31:36,336
Poor Horatio.

1272
01:31:38,900 --> 01:31:40,856
So quick to give,

1273
01:31:41,420 --> 01:31:43,980
so slow to accept the simplest giff.

1274
01:31:46,060 --> 01:31:49,814
You've done the same for me,
and others besides, a thousand times.

1275
01:31:51,220 --> 01:31:53,256
But never at such a dear cost.

1276
01:31:53,940 --> 01:31:55,896
Please take what I offer.

1277
01:31:57,180 --> 01:31:58,818
Just take it and say goodbye.

1278
01:32:02,660 --> 01:32:04,616
Archie...

1279
01:32:14,740 --> 01:32:17,300
I am honoured to have served with you.

1280
01:32:22,100 --> 01:32:24,056
And I to have known you.

1281
01:32:29,060 --> 01:32:31,016
You see?

1282
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:34,016
Better already.

1283
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:54,096
My dear friend.

1284
01:33:30,780 --> 01:33:36,059
I thought you might like to see a copy
of the Kingston Chronicle before you leave.

1285
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:44,889
"Captain Sawyer,
great leader until the last."

1286
01:33:44,980 --> 01:33:47,653
And you and Mr Bush
are highly commended.

1287
01:33:47,740 --> 01:33:51,255
It won 't be long
before the London papers publish the story.

1288
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:52,819
There's no mention of Mr Kennedy.

1289
01:33:52,900 --> 01:33:54,856
No. It was thought not politic.

1290
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:58,693
Nations need heroes, Mr Hornblower.

1291
01:33:58,780 --> 01:34:03,410
Heroes make us believe
the impossible is achievable.

1292
01:34:03,500 --> 01:34:06,139
Only if one knows their name.
Mr Kennedy...

1293
01:34:06,220 --> 01:34:10,736
Mr Kennedy took a calculated risk
when he pushed Captain Sawyer down the hold

1294
01:34:10,820 --> 01:34:14,859
for the good of the ship,
and in all likelihood was right to do so.

1295
01:34:17,900 --> 01:34:20,209
You think Mr Kennedy was telling the truth?

1296
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:23,895
I think Mr Kennedy
was a man of great loyalty, sir.

1297
01:34:24,740 --> 01:34:26,696
He saw his duty and did it.

1298
01:34:28,860 --> 01:34:32,853
And went to his grave
without the merit of his good name.

1299
01:34:32,940 --> 01:34:35,295
But you and I will not forget it.

1300
01:34:35,980 --> 01:34:37,493
No.

1301
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:41,573
I see the Gaditana
has been renamed Retribution.

1302
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:42,979
Oh?

1303
01:34:43,060 --> 01:34:44,175
Mm.

1304
01:34:44,260 --> 01:34:48,811
The paint is hardly dry and yet
they've appointed a new
commanding officer.

1305
01:34:48,900 --> 01:34:53,018
Would you not like to know
who is to command the Retribution?

1306
01:34:57,420 --> 01:34:59,376
Your orders, Commander.

1307
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:05,656
But Mr Bush is second in command.
The honour should go to...

1308
01:35:05,740 --> 01:35:08,413
I advise you when offered promotion
to accept it,

1309
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:11,936
otherwise it may not be offered again.
Am I making myself clear?

1310
01:35:12,020 --> 01:35:13,976
Yes, sir.

1311
01:35:14,980 --> 01:35:16,936
I wish you...

1312
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:22,060
a safe voyage, Mr Hornblower.

1313
01:35:33,580 --> 01:35:35,536
Thank you, sir.

1314
01:35:36,536 --> 01:35:46,536
