1
00:00:00,303 --> 00:00:04,361
P AR I S,  1 7 7 4

2
00:00:30,803 --> 00:00:34,361
Alas, Majesty, today Phoebus
is eclipsed by rain

3
00:00:35,025 --> 00:00:36,708
Your Majesty is our only sun

4
00:00:38,882 --> 00:00:40,743
Sire, the compliment is over

5
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:20,797
I can't believe it !
They didn't even say one word to you !

6
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,261
Desmoulins and Robespierre,
no talking ! Back in line !

7
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:02,282
The French Revolution "The Years of Hope"

8
00:03:53,873 --> 00:03:55,000
And all that !

9
00:03:59,397 --> 00:04:01,737
Your Majesty will make Fortune blush !

10
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,343
Dear Madame de Polignac,
you bring me luck

11
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:16,048
Your Majesty has lost

12
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:19,687
Here I am, penniless again

13
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:22,825
Now I have to tell the poor man
I can't pay my debts...

14
00:04:22,945 --> 00:04:24,735
... so he'll have to do it.

15
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:26,728
After all, I am his wife !

16
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,523
The fact is, every day
the country gets deeper in debt

17
00:04:45,094 --> 00:04:46,539
The costs of the court...

18
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:51,107
The Queen's personal expenses...

19
00:04:54,473 --> 00:04:57,879
Our participation in
the American war of independence...

20
00:04:58,318 --> 00:05:01,083
... which cost us 2,000 million livres

21
00:05:03,397 --> 00:05:06,612
Frankly, the outlook
is not very encouraging

22
00:05:18,238 --> 00:05:19,942
What do you advise, Monsieur Necker ?

23
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:22,605
Sire we have two options :

24
00:05:23,815 --> 00:05:27,114
First, default and let
the consequences fall where they may

25
00:05:27,234 --> 00:05:28,418
No, Monsieur Necker

26
00:05:41,399 --> 00:05:44,415
- Your second option ?
- Summon the Estates General

27
00:05:44,535 --> 00:05:48,526
It's the only body capable
of raising the taxes to pay the debt

28
00:05:49,399 --> 00:05:53,355
But we haven't had
to resort to that for 150 years

29
00:05:54,633 --> 00:05:56,284
Sire, it's inevitable

30
00:06:00,051 --> 00:06:02,399
This practice is quite uncivilized !

31
00:06:04,741 --> 00:06:09,219
I'll have to ask Dame Etiquette
the proper method of milking

32
00:06:16,436 --> 00:06:19,563
Mother ! Look ! I can ride all by myself !

33
00:06:30,379 --> 00:06:32,093
It's wonderful, darling !

34
00:06:34,808 --> 00:06:39,649
And now, dear brethren,
we're holding a meeting today...

35
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:42,014
... March 6, in the church vestibule

36
00:06:42,805 --> 00:06:46,193
It's to draw up
the List of Grievances for this parish

37
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:52,806
All men 25 years and older who pay taxes
are invited to come and contribute

38
00:06:55,724 --> 00:06:59,489
Our duty is to seize this opportunity
to tell the King...

39
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:02,965
... the truth about what
is amiss in his kingdom

40
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:13,763
I've had enough of lugging stones
around to please his lordship !

41
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:17,510
- You want useless chores abolished !
- That's right !

42
00:07:17,971 --> 00:07:22,106
And the salt tax too - when the salt
we buy is rotten and full of dirt !

43
00:07:22,503 --> 00:07:24,439
Please, give him
a chance to write it down

44
00:07:25,169 --> 00:07:28,732
As a doctor, I demand
that taxation be shared equally

45
00:07:29,256 --> 00:07:32,939
By what right are the nobles
and the priests exempt ?

46
00:07:33,888 --> 00:07:36,263
And why can only
the nobility be officers ?

47
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:39,765
Free access to all military,
civil and even church positions !

48
00:07:42,174 --> 00:07:43,840
- Ecclesiastic ?
- Exactly !

49
00:07:47,538 --> 00:07:49,849
What are you writing,
Camille Desmoulins ?

50
00:07:50,665 --> 00:07:54,921
No more privilege, no more
humiliation, and equality for all

51
00:07:56,056 --> 00:07:57,502
And Liberty too !

52
00:08:30,094 --> 00:08:31,549
"No more bread"

53
00:08:55,214 --> 00:08:57,357
Too proud to say hello
to your old friends ?

54
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,322
Someone thinks he's a bigshot !

55
00:09:01,322 --> 00:09:02,601
I wasn't elected

56
00:09:03,877 --> 00:09:07,038
Camille ! They're idiots.
They don't know a thing

57
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:27,366
You're not at Versailles ?

58
00:09:28,175 --> 00:09:30,338
Not this time - I lost.

59
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:41,756
Lucie, go to your room

60
00:09:49,207 --> 00:09:53,198
You good-for-nothing ! If you try to see
my daughter I'll have you whipped !

61
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,942
And arrested like a common criminal !

62
00:09:57,007 --> 00:10:00,348
Sir, I beg you to believe...

63
00:10:01,028 --> 00:10:05,210
... that I care very deeply
for your daughter

64
00:10:12,618 --> 00:10:16,342
Take my advice, Danton, get yourself
elected as a Deputy for Paris

65
00:10:16,462 --> 00:10:18,964
But do it now, or it will be too late

66
00:10:20,575 --> 00:10:24,472
Look at the stuff being written :
things are changing !

67
00:10:24,592 --> 00:10:26,083
What change ?

68
00:10:26,203 --> 00:10:30,841
Your kind and the clergy
will always outvote the commons

69
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:34,737
- My kind ?
- Yes, the nobility, Monsieur de Mirabeau

70
00:10:35,394 --> 00:10:38,335
It's two against one,
and nothing will ever change

71
00:10:38,668 --> 00:10:40,340
That's what you think ?

72
00:10:43,573 --> 00:10:46,297
I've been elected
as a member of the Third Estate

73
00:10:49,588 --> 00:10:55,548
How long can the ruling class
cling to its privileges ?

74
00:10:56,048 --> 00:10:58,889
The world is moving - look at America

75
00:10:59,009 --> 00:11:01,606
Privilege will never be abolished

76
00:11:04,034 --> 00:11:07,922
The best we can hope for is to
spread the wealth around a little

77
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:11,009
I'm not giving up my career for that

78
00:11:13,087 --> 00:11:14,087
Look

79
00:11:15,702 --> 00:11:16,928
She has a sister

80
00:11:18,813 --> 00:11:21,226
How about making a night of it ?

81
00:11:28,243 --> 00:11:31,695
No, I have work to do
and some friends are waiting for me.

82
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:37,393
Your noble ideas vanish quickly
when a pair of tits comes in sight

83
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:38,952
Two pairs of tits

84
00:11:56,278 --> 00:11:59,199
When did you add a "d'"
before your name ?

85
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:02,470
Since trying to make money in this
business ; any more stupid questions ?

86
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:07,954
That's for you...

87
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:10,557
This one's for you, and this too

88
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,922
I'll handle this one myself

89
00:12:26,295 --> 00:12:27,993
Write a summary

90
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:31,803
A grain merchant
who's claiming the right...

91
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:36,310
... to call himself
Viscount Something-or-other

92
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:39,230
A bloody fool, but he pays well

93
00:12:59,922 --> 00:13:02,796
Why are you attacking me ?
I don't hoard food like some people

94
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,630
You know it Danton ! Tell them !

95
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:28,126
They've already killed a baker

96
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:31,190
Everyone knew he hoarded grain

97
00:13:31,555 --> 00:13:33,237
I don't blame them

98
00:13:34,967 --> 00:13:38,618
They ought to hang all these damned
profiteers, to set an example

99
00:13:40,237 --> 00:13:42,813
Cut out your usual speech, Marat.

100
00:13:43,252 --> 00:13:45,951
This time it was Legendre,
but I know he's honest

101
00:13:46,071 --> 00:13:48,473
What difference does it make
to a starving crowd ?

102
00:13:55,804 --> 00:13:58,895
- Will she recover ?
- Probably not

103
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,704
Besides, she has a broken neck

104
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:32,983
Gabrielle, I'm hungry !

105
00:14:39,848 --> 00:14:42,579
Mirabeau was right. Things are changing

106
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,609
I should have stood for election

107
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:49,035
- Why ?
- To be a Deputy for Paris

108
00:14:50,355 --> 00:14:53,768
- Why ? You want to be ?
- No, I need to be

109
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:57,154
That smells good

110
00:14:57,821 --> 00:14:59,955
Action, Gabrielle... action

111
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:04,567
Have you ever in your life
just stood by and watched ?

112
00:15:06,055 --> 00:15:09,182
The more tempting the prospect...

113
00:15:10,135 --> 00:15:14,452
... the more I want to get my hands on it

114
00:15:29,193 --> 00:15:32,733
I believe that the three orders
assembled here...

115
00:15:33,161 --> 00:15:36,606
... will cooperate
for the general good of the state

116
00:15:37,288 --> 00:15:41,443
I declare myself
the first friend of my people

117
00:15:41,744 --> 00:15:46,983
And I welcome
the representatives of the nation...

118
00:15:47,103 --> 00:15:51,390
... it is my glory
to command by divine right

119
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:16,093
That's Lafayette

120
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:18,714
The Marquis de Lafayette ? From America ?

121
00:16:18,834 --> 00:16:22,401
Yes, my lord. The hero of the American
War of Independence

122
00:16:30,475 --> 00:16:36,065
Gentlemen. His Majesty
has summoned you here...

123
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:42,779
... in order to remedy a deficit which
has raised so much comment in Europe

124
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:47,518
- Who are those men all in black ?
- The Third Estate, my lord

125
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:50,803
What is the Third Estate ?

126
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:53,590
Those who are neither nobles nor priests

127
00:16:54,558 --> 00:16:56,288
That's a lot of people

128
00:17:00,422 --> 00:17:06,143
<i>It is thus my duty to demonstrate
to you in detail...</i>

129
00:17:06,263 --> 00:17:10,782
<i>... the absolute necessity
of financial assistance</i>

130
00:17:11,955 --> 00:17:15,876
<i>This is why you have received
the rare privilege...</i>

131
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,638
<i>... of being assembed
here in the Estates General</i>

132
00:17:20,532 --> 00:17:24,868
<i>Each order shall assemble separately...</i>

133
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,877
It's not Versailles, but it's
comfortable without costing too much

134
00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:38,701
- Have a seat
- I prefer the bed

135
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:44,931
- You don't mind eggs ?
- Not at all

136
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:55,171
- You're a lawyer, I hear
- Like you

137
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,710
I made the mistake of moving to Paris

138
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,029
Too many lawyers, not enough clients

139
00:18:06,578 --> 00:18:08,722
They want you to vote by order, right ?

140
00:18:11,315 --> 00:18:14,276
The clergy plus the nobility
make it 2 to 1

141
00:18:15,347 --> 00:18:17,312
At that rate, we'll always lose

142
00:18:18,164 --> 00:18:22,492
But if we vote as individuals,
the Third Estate has the majority

143
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,719
Necker isn't stupid ;
he knows what he wants

144
00:18:25,973 --> 00:18:30,574
He means well, but he's a banker.
And he's Swiss

145
00:18:39,897 --> 00:18:42,402
The problem is they don't live
in the same world we do

146
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,151
Well ?

147
00:18:46,786 --> 00:18:50,481
It would be enough if the lower
clergy, the poorest, join us

148
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:56,171
If nothing changes, they won't get
any money - it's as simple as that

149
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:22,076
Remember ? At Louis le Grand ?
Old Boiteux ?

150
00:19:24,284 --> 00:19:28,516
- "What is the Third Estate ?"
- "Nothing !"

151
00:19:28,636 --> 00:19:31,319
- "And what does it want ?"
- "Everything !"

152
00:19:40,280 --> 00:19:41,661
It's so long ago

153
00:19:44,036 --> 00:19:46,464
But you haven't changed

154
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:51,274
Always neat, with every hair in place

155
00:19:51,671 --> 00:19:57,108
My one luxury.
But you haven't changed either !

156
00:20:37,494 --> 00:20:40,025
A number of the clergy
have joined the Third Estate

157
00:20:41,558 --> 00:20:46,224
They say they form 96% of the country
and plan to form a National Assembly...

158
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,658
... without Your Majesty's assent

159
00:20:48,928 --> 00:20:52,008
- Just as I predicted !
- Please, brother

160
00:20:55,086 --> 00:20:57,859
The best solution, Monsieur Necker...

161
00:20:59,256 --> 00:21:02,764
... would be to address the 3 orders...

162
00:21:02,884 --> 00:21:07,165
... and inform them
that their actions are illegal

163
00:21:07,689 --> 00:21:12,926
Excuse me, Sire, but I feel the situation
requires diplomacy, not confrontation

164
00:21:13,046 --> 00:21:16,049
Our authority is all that's left,
Monsieur Necker

165
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:19,306
Authority and obedience
by force, if necessary

166
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:41,876
- What's happening ?
- They won't let us in.

167
00:21:42,833 --> 00:21:44,182
It's an outrage !

168
00:21:49,256 --> 00:21:50,780
To the Tennis Court !

169
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:11,371
Back to the changing room, gentlemen !

170
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:25,733
Bailly ! Take the chair !

171
00:22:34,958 --> 00:22:35,907
Silence !

172
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:43,448
Let us take an oath, here and now

173
00:22:44,194 --> 00:22:49,813
To never separate, to reassemble
wherever circumstances demand...

174
00:22:50,337 --> 00:22:55,107
... until we've given France
a constitution

175
00:22:55,227 --> 00:22:56,282
I swear !

176
00:23:06,502 --> 00:23:13,258
Therefore I declare void,
illegal and unconstitutional...

177
00:23:14,496 --> 00:23:17,131
... the acts of the
so-called National Assembly...

178
00:23:17,251 --> 00:23:19,631
... which is meeting despite my orders

179
00:23:20,655 --> 00:23:24,547
I am the sole guardian
of my people's welfare

180
00:23:25,944 --> 00:23:29,924
And if you abandon me
in such a weighty endeavor...

181
00:23:30,499 --> 00:23:33,873
... it is you who will be abandoned,
and not me

182
00:23:35,553 --> 00:23:38,191
I order you to disperse at once...

183
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:43,654
... and return to the rooms
set aside for your respective orders...

184
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,908
... to resume your meetings

185
00:23:54,976 --> 00:23:56,262
Vive le roi !

186
00:25:01,643 --> 00:25:04,529
By what right
do you occupy that seat, sir ?

187
00:25:04,649 --> 00:25:07,551
My name is Bailly - I'm an astronomer

188
00:25:08,201 --> 00:25:10,629
Member of the Academy of Science
and Member for Paris

189
00:25:11,645 --> 00:25:16,485
These gentlemen have elected me
President of the National Assembly

190
00:25:17,122 --> 00:25:21,059
You've all heard the King
order you to disperse !

191
00:25:21,836 --> 00:25:27,691
I believe that the nation in assembly
receives orders from no one

192
00:25:29,526 --> 00:25:34,741
Go tell those who sent you that we
are here by the will of the people

193
00:25:35,288 --> 00:25:39,422
And we won't leave
except at the point of a bayonet !

194
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:53,365
- They want to stay ?
- Yes, Sire

195
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,947
To hell with them then ! Let them stay !

196
00:26:06,664 --> 00:26:10,838
The Third Estate is not making a
challenge to the monarchy, just an appeal

197
00:26:11,484 --> 00:26:15,570
If you would recognize their legal
existence to help you govern...

198
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:18,325
Wanting to share
the King's power is treason

199
00:26:20,293 --> 00:26:22,759
You should hang them all,
as an example

200
00:26:30,667 --> 00:26:34,393
But if the Third Estate
has the support of the people--

201
00:26:35,702 --> 00:26:36,876
Send in the troops

202
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,971
I advise against it, Sire

203
00:26:41,715 --> 00:26:44,810
- If we could find a compromise--
- There is no compromise

204
00:26:46,937 --> 00:26:48,255
Except for time

205
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:59,950
If I understand you, Monsieur Necker,
the King cannot oppose this Assembly...

206
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:02,083
... without making things worse

207
00:27:03,329 --> 00:27:06,536
In that case, he shouldn't even try

208
00:27:08,329 --> 00:27:10,599
But rather, agree to their demands...

209
00:27:12,107 --> 00:27:13,329
... for now

210
00:27:14,458 --> 00:27:18,716
But the King must prepare to respond
to their next demands with force

211
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:25,275
It appears Her Majesty understands
the situation better than any of us

212
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:31,704
The intervention of the foreign
regiments seems to me ill-advised

213
00:28:32,604 --> 00:28:37,377
They are regiments from
the provinces, not foreign

214
00:28:39,105 --> 00:28:43,775
And I can count on their loyalty in the
event of an insurrection in the capitol

215
00:28:44,446 --> 00:28:47,208
The people do not see the uniforms,
but the men wearing them

216
00:28:48,858 --> 00:28:52,811
Swiss and German troops,
most of whom don't even speak French

217
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:58,582
They don't see the love Your Majesty has
for them - just a sign of tyranny

218
00:29:00,002 --> 00:29:01,573
It's what your enemies want

219
00:29:02,224 --> 00:29:04,756
That is not my opinion, Monsieur Necker

220
00:29:05,597 --> 00:29:09,057
Nor is it the opinion
of those I have confidence in

221
00:29:15,068 --> 00:29:19,226
Then, Your Majesty, I have no choice...

222
00:29:19,655 --> 00:29:22,068
... but to offer my resignation

223
00:29:23,393 --> 00:29:25,901
And I to accept it

224
00:29:58,704 --> 00:29:59,704
Citizens !

225
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:08,896
I've come from Versailles.
The King has dismissed Necker !

226
00:30:11,837 --> 00:30:16,266
It's the signal for a St. Bartholomew's
Massacre of patriots !

227
00:30:18,227 --> 00:30:25,298
Tonight Swiss and German batallions
will come out to slaughter us !

228
00:30:28,554 --> 00:30:32,046
There's only one solution :
to take up arms !

229
00:30:32,761 --> 00:30:35,427
To arms ! To arms !

230
00:30:35,856 --> 00:30:38,105
All Paris must take up arms !

231
00:30:50,579 --> 00:30:53,642
My friends, we know our enemies.

232
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:56,833
But we need a way
to recognize each other

233
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:04,052
All those who want to fight...

234
00:31:04,433 --> 00:31:09,194
... proudly declare it by wearing green

235
00:31:09,314 --> 00:31:11,444
Green, the color of hope

236
00:31:11,952 --> 00:31:14,221
This will be our symbol !

237
00:31:14,507 --> 00:31:15,721
Our uniform !

238
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,444
Our victory !

239
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:34,190
Look ! The police are here !

240
00:31:38,158 --> 00:31:41,150
I call my brothers to liberty

241
00:31:41,531 --> 00:31:43,245
You won't take me alive

242
00:31:43,924 --> 00:31:49,210
And I will die gloriously rather than
see France remain in bondage !

243
00:32:39,944 --> 00:32:44,110
The King has dismissed Necker.
If he uses his troops it'll cost him

244
00:33:02,578 --> 00:33:06,073
My friend you can write
your memoires later. Come on !

245
00:33:07,884 --> 00:33:10,701
News from the Palais Royale ;
they've called for insurrection !

246
00:33:10,821 --> 00:33:12,766
- Why ?
- The King has dismissed Necker

247
00:33:50,705 --> 00:33:53,410
This is a direct attack
on the will of the people...

248
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:56,403
... expressed through
their elected representatives !

249
00:34:05,394 --> 00:34:09,181
Will we allow Tyranny
to triumph over Liberty ? No !

250
00:34:15,965 --> 00:34:19,632
Will we allow one man the power
to wipe away in a single day...

251
00:34:19,902 --> 00:34:24,072
... the hope of finally seeing
a free people in France ? No !

252
00:34:30,657 --> 00:34:34,165
I want every man
of the district to be a volunteer

253
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,732
We will show the whole world...

254
00:34:38,891 --> 00:34:42,256
... that we have no fear of these dogs...

255
00:34:43,002 --> 00:34:45,456
... who dare lay siege to our city !

256
00:34:57,981 --> 00:34:59,187
Sign with me !

257
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:17,308
Don't worry, we'll wake them up !
My name's Fournoyer

258
00:35:18,882 --> 00:35:22,507
They call me "The American".
I was a distiller in Santo Domingo

259
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:25,724
Where will we get the weapons ?

260
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:29,549
The guns are at Les Invalides ;
and the powder at the Bastille !

261
00:35:46,299 --> 00:35:48,384
Very good, Lieutenant.
Any problems ?

262
00:35:48,504 --> 00:35:51,788
Just one.
If I give the order, will they fire ?

263
00:35:58,283 --> 00:36:00,775
- Surely your Swiss will ?
- Probably.

264
00:36:01,156 --> 00:36:03,442
But can you count on your own men ?

265
00:36:13,931 --> 00:36:16,106
The powder ! The powder !

266
00:36:24,596 --> 00:36:26,390
Citizens - we must have the Bastille

267
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,496
We want the Bastille !

268
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:32,063
They have to pull back the cannons

269
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,783
Make way for the delegation from the
Permanent Committee of the Hôtel de Ville

270
00:36:47,151 --> 00:36:49,096
Make them remove the cannons !

271
00:36:54,804 --> 00:36:56,754
I've never heard of your committee.

272
00:36:57,328 --> 00:37:01,401
As of yesterday, the Members for Paris
have met at the Hôtel de Ville

273
00:37:01,709 --> 00:37:06,185
They've formed a permanent committee
to maintain order in the capitol

274
00:37:06,566 --> 00:37:10,632
Are you here to force a confrontation,
or find a way of avoiding it ?

275
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:15,408
- We're not here to threaten
- Then we agree on the essential points

276
00:37:18,244 --> 00:37:21,276
Gentlemen, I was about to dine

277
00:37:22,514 --> 00:37:24,355
Will you join me ?

278
00:37:31,033 --> 00:37:33,334
- What's going on ?
- They're still inside

279
00:37:33,454 --> 00:37:35,362
- Prisoners ?
- No one knows

280
00:37:35,482 --> 00:37:37,089
We want the Bastille !

281
00:37:39,954 --> 00:37:42,585
Apparently, sir, you are not hostile
to the people of Paris

282
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:48,742
We need you to show it. Pull back
the cannons - the Committee demands it

283
00:37:49,523 --> 00:37:52,856
But why ? The cannons
have always been there

284
00:37:53,603 --> 00:37:56,451
It's an insult to the people.
It's intolerable

285
00:37:57,237 --> 00:37:59,975
These poor old cannons !

286
00:38:00,848 --> 00:38:05,260
You've seen them; where they are
they can't fire on the people

287
00:38:05,380 --> 00:38:07,466
It doesn't matter; people are afraid

288
00:38:09,276 --> 00:38:10,933
You must withdraw them, Governor

289
00:38:16,156 --> 00:38:22,018
- You want me to make a gesture
- Of goodwill

290
00:38:29,344 --> 00:38:33,445
My compliments to Lieutenant Deflue ;
please ask him to withdraw the cannons

291
00:38:35,883 --> 00:38:37,598
And close the openings

292
00:38:40,014 --> 00:38:42,754
Our committee could not ask for more

293
00:38:52,909 --> 00:38:55,310
Look ! They're pulling back the cannons !

294
00:38:56,210 --> 00:38:58,448
To load them ! They're going to fire !

295
00:39:01,354 --> 00:39:03,023
I have to alert the district !

296
00:39:05,704 --> 00:39:08,445
Do you know how many
prisoners we have here ?

297
00:39:10,259 --> 00:39:11,275
Seven

298
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,025
Four forgers, with long records

299
00:39:18,624 --> 00:39:20,346
One's a murderer

300
00:39:21,711 --> 00:39:25,648
And there's also an Irishman
who thinks he's Julius Caesar

301
00:39:28,628 --> 00:39:31,334
Let me through - I know the Governor

302
00:39:31,914 --> 00:39:33,993
He's a friend, I can talk to him

303
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,967
You see, I've kept my word

304
00:39:53,619 --> 00:39:55,698
You must surrender the fortress, sir

305
00:39:56,603 --> 00:39:58,534
Nobody said anything about that

306
00:39:58,793 --> 00:40:00,470
The Permanent Committee--

307
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:03,001
The Bastille is in our district

308
00:40:03,914 --> 00:40:08,182
And the distict demands that you open
the gates of the Bastille to the people

309
00:40:12,614 --> 00:40:16,526
With all these innovations, it's very
difficult for an officer of the King...

310
00:40:17,328 --> 00:40:19,394
... to know where his duty lies

311
00:40:26,387 --> 00:40:29,551
Opening the gates is out of the question

312
00:40:41,556 --> 00:40:43,921
They're telling us to enter ! Come on !

313
00:40:49,064 --> 00:40:53,143
They don't understand !
They're advancing instead of leaving !

314
00:41:02,762 --> 00:41:06,497
- So this is how you negotiate
- I'll go down and talk to them

315
00:41:10,479 --> 00:41:11,685
The cannons !

316
00:41:18,277 --> 00:41:19,435
Take aim !

317
00:41:20,689 --> 00:41:23,430
- You're not going to fire !
- Don't worry

318
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:26,712
I just want to show them
that the Bastille can defend itself

319
00:41:28,474 --> 00:41:30,999
Do not fire without my orders !

320
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:41,095
Sir, if you have any authority over your
district, order your people to retreat

321
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:44,649
Tell them I've promised
not to fire first

322
00:42:17,312 --> 00:42:18,757
Stop ! Stop !

323
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:24,916
We have no choice

324
00:42:25,757 --> 00:42:28,377
- Take aim
- No, it'll be a bloodbath

325
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,997
Hold your fire !

326
00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:35,755
If you won't fire, we're lost

327
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,529
Take aim !

328
00:42:43,154 --> 00:42:43,917
Fire !

329
00:42:45,170 --> 00:42:46,233
Fire !

330
00:43:08,911 --> 00:43:09,967
Cease fire !

331
00:43:40,703 --> 00:43:42,279
What are you doing ?

332
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:03,740
We're saved !

333
00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:46,910
Long live the nation !

334
00:45:29,886 --> 00:45:31,330
Hey there, someone !

335
00:45:35,616 --> 00:45:38,547
Lieutenant Deflue -
I have a message from the Governor

336
00:45:41,677 --> 00:45:42,915
Bring a board !

337
00:45:45,036 --> 00:45:47,988
Cease fire !
There's a message from the Governor !

338
00:46:12,300 --> 00:46:15,005
"We have 2,000 barrels of powder

339
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:20,728
Surrender, or we will
blow up the neighborhood"

340
00:46:24,530 --> 00:46:28,394
No surrender !
They must lower the drawbridge !

341
00:46:34,451 --> 00:46:36,054
We won't allow it, Sir

342
00:47:03,453 --> 00:47:05,294
Bring me my journal

343
00:47:15,633 --> 00:47:20,058
An agreeable afternoon, Cléry
but not very successful

344
00:47:20,905 --> 00:47:22,207
Not even a rabbit

345
00:47:30,905 --> 00:47:33,161
"July 14 - Nothing"

346
00:48:05,615 --> 00:48:06,520
Sire...

347
00:48:12,322 --> 00:48:13,417
What is it ?

348
00:48:13,537 --> 00:48:16,290
Sire, the Parisians
have taken the Bastille

349
00:48:21,480 --> 00:48:24,569
Taken the Bastille ? What for ?

350
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:29,279
It's a revolt

351
00:48:29,696 --> 00:48:31,966
No, Sire ; it's a revolution

352
00:48:44,691 --> 00:48:48,548
If the troops want to fire on Liberty,
they'll find barricades in their way !

353
00:48:48,668 --> 00:48:52,818
And the Cordeliers Club
will build the tallest one !

354
00:48:54,676 --> 00:48:57,407
- It's just that too many died
- What did you expect ?

355
00:48:57,527 --> 00:49:01,575
You can't build the kind of world you
want without breaking a few heads

356
00:49:03,613 --> 00:49:06,649
Now whatever happens,
things can never be the same

357
00:49:06,769 --> 00:49:09,122
That's for sure - never again

358
00:49:09,787 --> 00:49:12,287
Here's the wine,
for anyone who's thirsty !

359
00:49:16,557 --> 00:49:17,879
Vive Danton !

360
00:49:23,665 --> 00:49:25,503
You're lovelier than ever

361
00:49:45,340 --> 00:49:47,190
Just say the word and I'll stay

362
00:49:48,594 --> 00:49:50,481
Write me when you get to Basle

363
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:52,276
I'll be there in a week

364
00:49:52,396 --> 00:49:55,425
Persuade the King
to take refuge in Metz. You must !

365
00:49:56,078 --> 00:49:57,610
He prefers to stay in Paris

366
00:49:58,054 --> 00:50:01,578
To win over his faithful subjects
who want to murder him !

367
00:50:02,526 --> 00:50:05,478
- I'll stay
- Goodbye

368
00:50:40,917 --> 00:50:42,503
You really don't want to go ?

369
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:45,352
I can't leave you here alone

370
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:55,813
Oh, my dear, faithful friend !

371
00:50:58,702 --> 00:51:00,764
No one is to shout "Vive le roi !"

372
00:51:38,825 --> 00:51:43,651
Your Majesty, these keys
were presented to Henri IV...

373
00:51:44,095 --> 00:51:46,175
... after he reconquered his people

374
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:50,500
Today it is the people
who have reconquered their king

375
00:51:59,381 --> 00:52:03,191
So you are the Mayor of Paris,
Monsieur Bailly ?

376
00:52:03,699 --> 00:52:04,954
Yes, Your Majesty

377
00:52:05,429 --> 00:52:08,682
Until now, Paris has not had a Mayor

378
00:52:10,064 --> 00:52:12,429
The electors decided that it was time

379
00:52:14,620 --> 00:52:16,233
Ah, well, if they've decided

380
00:52:18,270 --> 00:52:21,037
If Your Majesty
would be so good as to follow me

381
00:52:36,273 --> 00:52:40,796
Monsieur de Lafayette,
I believe you also have something to say

382
00:52:43,146 --> 00:52:49,499
Your Majesty, the volunteers
who have mobilized to defend Paris...

383
00:52:50,249 --> 00:52:52,755
... have adopted
the name "National Guard"

384
00:52:54,011 --> 00:52:56,098
And they have named me their General

385
00:53:00,913 --> 00:53:06,172
Naturally, I could not accept this
appointment without your approval

386
00:53:08,121 --> 00:53:11,502
Then I must congratulate you, General

387
00:53:26,926 --> 00:53:32,165
Sire, all Parisians who love liberty...

388
00:53:33,196 --> 00:53:36,514
... have adopted the colors
of the capitol : blue and red

389
00:53:38,001 --> 00:53:39,224
I have noticed

390
00:53:39,477 --> 00:53:42,299
But I've added the white of the monarchy

391
00:53:43,477 --> 00:53:44,683
Excellent idea !

392
00:53:51,865 --> 00:53:55,433
If Your Majesty would be pleased
to pin this cockade to your hat...

393
00:53:56,072 --> 00:53:58,199
... your loyal subjects
would be overjoyed.

394
00:54:03,923 --> 00:54:06,304
Perhaps you could pin it on for me

395
00:54:21,155 --> 00:54:25,615
Gentlemen, I have some news for you

396
00:54:29,895 --> 00:54:34,958
I have ordered the withdrawal
of the troops presently in the capitol

397
00:54:37,276 --> 00:54:40,944
And this morning
I wrote to Monsieur Necker...

398
00:54:41,691 --> 00:54:44,691
... to ask him to rejoin my ministry

399
00:55:21,754 --> 00:55:23,530
Such back-breaking labor,
Monsieur le Comte

400
00:55:23,650 --> 00:55:26,167
It couldn't go on any longer

401
00:55:30,843 --> 00:55:32,017
August 4, 1789

402
00:55:32,430 --> 00:55:36,869
These attacks on the property of the
nobility, across the entire country...

403
00:55:37,160 --> 00:55:39,767
... are not acts of common vandalism

404
00:55:40,239 --> 00:55:42,732
These attacks should fill us with pride

405
00:55:43,366 --> 00:55:46,958
They are the funeral pyres of privilege !

406
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:57,701
Tell the people that you recognize
the injustice of the rights...

407
00:55:57,821 --> 00:56:01,193
... acquired during
the dark days of ignorance

408
00:56:09,131 --> 00:56:14,086
Our colleague from Bretagne is right.
The people's anger is a just anger

409
00:56:15,012 --> 00:56:19,658
I, Viscount de Noailles
propose that all privileges...

410
00:56:20,039 --> 00:56:22,150
... and rights of the nobility
be abolished

411
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:40,770
I, Count de Beauharnais propose
that henceforth all occupations...

412
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:44,310
... be open to all: nobles and commoners

413
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:57,162
I, Duke de la 
Rochefoucault-Liancourt propose...

414
00:56:57,782 --> 00:57:01,813
... that the National Assembly
abolish slavery

415
00:57:02,321 --> 00:57:05,708
And recognize
that blacks are human beings

416
00:57:11,896 --> 00:57:17,198
I, Bishop of Nancy,
renounce the possessions...

417
00:57:17,610 --> 00:57:22,086
... that the Church has unjustly
acquired for too long

418
00:57:26,339 --> 00:57:29,846
They're drunk on fine words
and good intentions

419
00:57:30,752 --> 00:57:34,425
They'll wake up with a nice hangover

420
00:57:35,411 --> 00:57:38,822
And they'll go back on everything
they've given up

421
00:57:46,146 --> 00:57:47,649
Citizens, listen !

422
00:57:49,527 --> 00:57:52,498
The Assembly has declared
freedom of religion

423
00:57:53,398 --> 00:57:54,717
Who gives a damn ?

424
00:57:56,351 --> 00:58:01,716
But much more important ;
they've declared freedom of the press !

425
00:58:04,097 --> 00:58:05,703
I'll start my paper, Georges !

426
00:58:05,823 --> 00:58:08,716
I've already got the name :
Revolutions of France and Brabant

427
00:58:08,836 --> 00:58:10,999
Write, Camille.
It's what you do best

428
00:58:13,288 --> 00:58:15,783
I'll listen to the people,
and I'll say everything :

429
00:58:15,903 --> 00:58:18,988
Their concerns, their hopes, their joys

430
00:58:19,428 --> 00:58:21,608
But to understand, not manipulate them

431
00:58:21,728 --> 00:58:24,072
Without betraying
the truth or my conscience

432
00:58:26,915 --> 00:58:28,289
I'll find you the money

433
00:58:28,883 --> 00:58:33,518
The representatives of the French people,
formed into the National Assembly...

434
00:58:35,010 --> 00:58:39,081
... considering that ignorance,
forgetfulness...

435
00:58:40,113 --> 00:58:42,612
... or contempt for the Rights of Man...

436
00:58:42,732 --> 00:58:48,025
... are the sole cause of public suffering
and government corruption...

437
00:58:49,263 --> 00:58:52,173
... have resolved to express
in a solemn declaration...

438
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:58,503
... the natural, inalienable
and sacred rights of man

439
00:59:01,820 --> 00:59:03,729
I ask you to rise, gentlemen

440
00:59:11,216 --> 00:59:17,185
Article 1 : Men are born and remain
free and equal before the Law

441
00:59:18,756 --> 00:59:24,446
Social distinctions can be founded
only upon public utility

442
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:33,661
<i>These rights are Liberty, Property,
Security and Resistance to Oppression</i>

443
00:59:38,332 --> 00:59:42,200
<i>The nation is essentially
the source of all sovereignty</i>

444
00:59:45,332 --> 00:59:49,358
<i>The Law may only forbid
activities harmful to society</i>

445
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:55,274
<i>Whatever is not forbidden by Law
cannot be hindered</i>

446
00:59:57,316 --> 01:00:00,812
<i>The Law is the expression
of the general Will</i>

447
01:00:02,327 --> 01:00:04,454
<i>All citizens are equal before it...</i>

448
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:08,994
<i>... and equally eligible
for every public position and honor</i>

449
01:00:11,995 --> 01:00:17,551
<i>No man can be accused, arrested or
imprisoned unless by force of Law</i>

450
01:00:21,522 --> 01:00:25,446
<i>Every man is presumed innocent
until proven guilty</i>

451
01:00:27,728 --> 01:00:31,575
<i>No one can be persecuted
for his beliefs, including religious</i>

452
01:00:36,114 --> 01:00:39,043
<i>The free expression
of ideas and opinions...</i>

453
01:00:39,163 --> 01:00:41,646
<i>... is one of the most
precious rights of mankind</i>

454
01:00:42,709 --> 01:00:47,226
<i>All citizens may speak,
write and publish freely...</i>

455
01:00:48,197 --> 01:00:53,101
<i>... except as determined by the Law
in order to preserve Liberty</i>

456
01:00:57,181 --> 01:01:01,607
<i>The safeguard of the Rights of Man and
the citizenry requires a public force</i>

457
01:01:02,498 --> 01:01:06,038
<i>This force is formed
for the benefit of all</i>

458
01:01:08,601 --> 01:01:11,712
<i>The right of private property
is sacred and inviolable</i>

459
01:01:12,029 --> 01:01:14,069
<i>None can be deprived of it...</i>

460
01:01:14,719 --> 01:01:19,608
<i>... except when the common good
legitimately requires it</i>

461
01:01:25,881 --> 01:01:30,670
I've done my best, Monsieur Necker,
but I will not sign

462
01:01:31,580 --> 01:01:36,020
Neither the Decree on the Abandonment
of Privileges, nor the Rights of Man

463
01:01:39,097 --> 01:01:41,668
How will the Church survive
without its tithes ?

464
01:01:42,367 --> 01:01:45,735
And the minor nobility without
the revenue of their peasants ?

465
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:49,061
Sire, the nobility
and the clergy themselves--

466
01:01:49,181 --> 01:01:50,014
I know

467
01:01:54,457 --> 01:01:57,029
But why the Rights of Man ?

468
01:01:57,933 --> 01:01:59,156
I am the King !

469
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:04,241
How can one share what is abolute ?

470
01:02:15,583 --> 01:02:18,392
Your Majesty must not
underestimate the risk--

471
01:02:20,249 --> 01:02:26,145
This is why I summoned
the Regiment of Flanders to Versailles

472
01:02:30,938 --> 01:02:33,049
I know that I can count on them

473
01:02:39,639 --> 01:02:42,274
Governing is a serious matter

474
01:02:43,306 --> 01:02:47,904
To do it you have to find
a genuine balance of power...

475
01:02:48,024 --> 01:02:50,295
... between the executive
and the legislative

476
01:02:51,471 --> 01:02:55,907
That's why you defended the veto power ?

477
01:02:56,313 --> 01:03:00,259
Whether it's a king, a president
or something else, it doesn't matter

478
01:03:01,146 --> 01:03:06,800
An unlimited, all-powerful Assembly
will lead to disaster

479
01:03:08,046 --> 01:03:08,697
Why ?

480
01:03:09,014 --> 01:03:11,729
Because all the power
is concentrated there

481
01:03:12,395 --> 01:03:15,300
What's important is sovereignty

482
01:03:15,586 --> 01:03:18,979
It must be shared between
the King and the Assembly

483
01:03:20,814 --> 01:03:21,819
Impossible

484
01:03:22,941 --> 01:03:26,370
In that case, you'll create
an even worse dictatorship

485
01:03:30,207 --> 01:03:32,630
Excuse me - I'm expecting my confessor

486
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:47,467
A little patience !
I'm nearly finished my work

487
01:03:51,458 --> 01:03:52,346
Kiss me !

488
01:03:57,672 --> 01:04:02,302
Gabriel-Honoré I'll give you 5 minutes -
not one more

489
01:04:26,124 --> 01:04:29,224
I've tried to make it
less uncompromising

490
01:04:30,314 --> 01:04:34,366
If you won't sign now,
there's nothing more I can do

491
01:04:40,445 --> 01:04:42,604
It's excellent, as always

492
01:04:43,587 --> 01:04:44,824
Let me sign

493
01:04:48,460 --> 01:04:50,841
As usual, you get what you want

494
01:04:51,492 --> 01:04:54,263
And you, at least, a decent meal

495
01:04:56,858 --> 01:04:59,287
You're a corruptor, Monsieur de Mirabeau

496
01:05:01,231 --> 01:05:06,074
If it gives you any comfort, look around

497
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:09,088
Nothing in this house is paid for

498
01:05:12,427 --> 01:05:13,750
Except for you

499
01:05:16,204 --> 01:05:20,301
Even the servants
are worried about their wages

500
01:05:20,643 --> 01:05:22,080
How do you do it ?

501
01:05:22,373 --> 01:05:25,919
It's the art of keeping
6 balls in the air at once

502
01:05:26,532 --> 01:05:30,643
But two of them inevitably are your own

503
01:05:33,795 --> 01:05:35,828
Do you advise me
to go to confession ?

504
01:05:35,948 --> 01:05:37,384
Not necessarily

505
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:41,145
I find I have a few extra matters
to attend to

506
01:06:06,049 --> 01:06:08,732
Gentlemen ! A toast : to the King !

507
01:06:13,728 --> 01:06:15,839
<i>To Her Majesty the Queen !</i>

508
01:06:37,540 --> 01:06:39,407
Please rise, gentlemen

509
01:06:42,318 --> 01:06:43,397
Thank you all

510
01:06:44,935 --> 01:06:47,881
I'm so happy
to find myself among friends

511
01:06:51,919 --> 01:06:54,975
We'll give our last drop of blood
for Your Majesty

512
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:16,741
Wait your turn; there's enough for all !

513
01:07:40,534 --> 01:07:42,668
Are you alright ? Where do you live ?

514
01:07:45,185 --> 01:07:47,153
Look at me ! I want to help

515
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,547
I haven't eaten for 3 days

516
01:08:05,865 --> 01:08:07,468
Down with the Assembly !

517
01:08:09,938 --> 01:08:11,559
And no more tricolors !

518
01:08:20,401 --> 01:08:23,401
Gentlemen - I'll never forget this !

519
01:08:27,417 --> 01:08:31,430
Once again,
the Austrian bitch is responsable...

520
01:08:32,843 --> 01:08:36,017
... for this court-orchestrated
counter-revolution

521
01:08:36,509 --> 01:08:38,709
Exclamation mark after revolution

522
01:08:39,839 --> 01:08:41,997
Marat has everything
on the Versailles banquet

523
01:08:45,696 --> 01:08:49,911
People of Paris,
the events at Versailles...

524
01:08:51,752 --> 01:08:54,053
... are an insult to Liberty

525
01:08:54,799 --> 01:08:56,308
I call for rebellion

526
01:09:00,466 --> 01:09:01,932
No... for insurrection

527
01:09:03,577 --> 01:09:04,752
That's better

528
01:09:07,992 --> 01:09:10,484
To arms ! To arms !

529
01:09:13,040 --> 01:09:16,024
- "To arms" twice ?
- And again !

530
01:09:17,623 --> 01:09:18,903
It's for the paper ?

531
01:09:22,242 --> 01:09:24,020
For the greatest paper of all :

532
01:09:26,925 --> 01:09:28,184
The walls of Paris

533
01:10:41,749 --> 01:10:43,845
Bread ! Give us bread !

534
01:11:03,905 --> 01:11:06,072
If you refuse to march on Versailles...

535
01:11:06,192 --> 01:11:10,548
... to demand the King listen
to his people, then we will !

536
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,531
We'll bring back the baker
and the baker's wife !

537
01:11:15,817 --> 01:11:17,391
And the baker's boy !

538
01:11:19,325 --> 01:11:20,610
To Versailles !

539
01:11:28,699 --> 01:11:30,325
An order from the Commune :

540
01:11:30,445 --> 01:11:32,990
You're to lead
the National Guard to Versailles

541
01:11:33,110 --> 01:11:35,062
To bring the King
and his family back to Paris

542
01:11:35,438 --> 01:11:38,105
We are the King's Guard,
not his jailors !

543
01:11:42,419 --> 01:11:46,340
The women of Paris are marching
to Versailles to demand bread !

544
01:11:46,959 --> 01:11:49,634
Let's march with them
as a matter of honor

545
01:11:49,754 --> 01:11:52,361
The cause that we've fought for
is lost...

546
01:11:52,481 --> 01:11:56,970
... if you won't show that you're ready
to fight for what you've won !

547
01:12:51,971 --> 01:12:55,018
Make way for the President
of the National Assembly !

548
01:13:10,550 --> 01:13:11,788
No more than four

549
01:13:14,867 --> 01:13:15,915
And no pikes

550
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:20,696
That's enough !

551
01:13:49,798 --> 01:13:53,298
Ladies, welcome

552
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:55,766
What can I do for you ?

553
01:13:55,886 --> 01:14:00,457
Your Majesty, these four women speak on
behalf of the women of Paris

554
01:14:00,577 --> 01:14:05,414
All Paris wishes to know Your Majesty's
attitude toward the Rights of Man, and--

555
01:14:05,807 --> 01:14:10,874
Perhaps His Majesty would prefer
to hear directly from these women

556
01:14:33,002 --> 01:14:34,177
Your Majesty...

557
01:14:37,955 --> 01:14:39,002
Bread...

558
01:14:45,965 --> 01:14:48,710
Well, Monsieur Mounier,
here we are in fresh difficulties

559
01:14:55,859 --> 01:14:56,738
Bread...

560
01:14:57,954 --> 01:14:58,890
Bread ?

561
01:14:59,859 --> 01:15:02,324
You will have bread ; I promise

562
01:15:08,417 --> 01:15:10,941
I beg you not to stay. Come with us

563
01:15:11,656 --> 01:15:13,925
I am the King ! I can't flee

564
01:15:14,175 --> 01:15:15,757
Is it better to be a prisoner ?

565
01:15:16,239 --> 01:15:17,699
At least you could try--

566
01:15:30,196 --> 01:15:32,980
The mob is blocking the stables ;
it is impossible to get out

567
01:15:35,162 --> 01:15:38,178
You see ? We thought we had some choice

568
01:15:38,495 --> 01:15:39,828
We were wrong

569
01:15:53,561 --> 01:15:55,053
Where are my glasses ?

570
01:15:55,794 --> 01:15:59,556
Please, Monsieur Mounier,
re-read your text aloud

571
01:16:00,905 --> 01:16:04,143
I accept purely and simply
the Articles of the Constitution...

572
01:16:04,429 --> 01:16:08,688
... and the Rights of Man as submitted
to me by the National Assembly

573
01:16:10,128 --> 01:16:11,888
Is that agreeable, Your Majesty ?

574
01:16:12,937 --> 01:16:14,778
Does that matter anymore ?

575
01:16:57,642 --> 01:17:00,434
As you can see, His Majesty has signed

576
01:17:04,175 --> 01:17:09,509
History will remember Your Majesty as
the greatest of France's kings

577
01:17:13,948 --> 01:17:16,109
Bread and flour
are on their way to Paris

578
01:17:19,329 --> 01:17:23,968
Perhaps it's time for everyone
to go home, Monsieur de Lafayette

579
01:17:27,928 --> 01:17:31,541
Sire, these gentlemen
are from the Paris Commune

580
01:17:33,754 --> 01:17:37,334
And what is it the people of Paris want ?

581
01:17:39,826 --> 01:17:44,572
They wish that the National Guard take
charge of the King's personal security

582
01:17:48,571 --> 01:17:51,431
You can arrange that,
Monsieur de Lafayette ?

583
01:17:53,475 --> 01:17:57,984
Also the removal of royal troops, whose
presence is an insult to the people

584
01:18:01,652 --> 01:18:02,804
Is that all ?

585
01:18:05,938 --> 01:18:10,694
The Parisians also demand
that the King return to Paris

586
01:18:12,789 --> 01:18:14,932
That requires some thought

587
01:18:18,676 --> 01:18:20,454
It's been a long day

588
01:18:22,676 --> 01:18:25,914
We will discuss this further
in the morning

589
01:18:31,644 --> 01:18:35,278
Good night, Monsieur
de Lafayette, gentlemen

590
01:18:49,915 --> 01:18:53,229
I beg Your Majesty to let me
stand guard outside your room

591
01:18:55,105 --> 01:18:57,359
No. The rumors
only aggravate their hatred

592
01:18:58,348 --> 01:19:02,539
Go to bed, Axel.
I'll try to do the same
