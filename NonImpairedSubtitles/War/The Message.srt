1
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:12,399
In the name of God, the most gracious, the most Merciful

2
00:02:12,448 --> 00:02:17,045
From Muhammad, the Messenger of God
to Heraclius,

3
00:02:17,086 --> 00:02:21,979
the emperor of Byzantium, greetings to him
who is the follower of righteous guys

4
00:02:22,026 --> 00:02:25,121
I bid you to hear the divine call

5
00:02:25,163 --> 00:02:31,866
I am the messenger of God to the people,
accept Islam for yourself

6
00:02:35,043 --> 00:02:37,159
He speaks of the new prophet in Arabia

7
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:41,170
Was it like this when John, the Baptist

8
00:02:41,183 --> 00:02:43,937
came to king Hsrul out of the desert crying of salvation

9
00:03:08,951 --> 00:03:11,375
To Mephocus, Patriarch of Alexandria

10
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:30,131
Kisra, emperor of Persia
Muhammad calls you with the call of God

11
00:03:30,178 --> 00:03:34,878
accept Islam for your salvation
Embrace Islam

12
00:03:37,587 --> 00:03:43,380
You come out of the desert, smelling of camel and goat
You stand as Persia kneel?

13
00:03:52,472 --> 00:03:58,140
Muhammad, Messenger of God
Who gave him this authority?

14
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,399
God sent Muhammad as
a message to mankind

15
00:04:56,919 --> 00:04:59,946
The Scholars and Historians of Islam -
The University of Al-Azhar in Cairo,

16
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:07,194
The High Islamic Congress of the Shiat in Lebanon
Have approved the accuracy and fidelity of this film

17
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:08,861
The makers of this film honour the Islamic Tradition

18
00:05:08,902 --> 00:05:11,245
which holds that the Impersonation of the Prophet

19
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:16,403
offends againts the spirituality of his message

20
00:05:16,444 --> 00:05:27,051
Therefore, the person of Muhammad
will not be shown

21
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:35,950
600 years after Christ died,

22
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:39,291
when Europe was sunk in the dark ages
and everywhere

23
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:45,098
the old civilizations were falling,
Muhammad was born in Mecca in Arabia

24
00:05:45,147 --> 00:05:50,677
Mecca was then a rich trading city
ruled by its merchants

25
00:05:50,721 --> 00:05:55,284
whose wealth was multiplied by a
unique privilege They housed the gods

26
00:05:56,395 --> 00:06:01,459
Every year, at the time of the great fair,
the desert priests brought their idols

27
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:04,380
and the images of their gods into the custody of Kabbaah

28
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:40,793
Months, the most holyish reign of Abraham,
the Kabbaah has now

29
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:47,177
become a house of idology hosting 
no fewer than 360 different gods

30
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:51,987
Mecca in 610 AD

31
00:07:24,238 --> 00:07:25,193
Bilal!

32
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,665
Have the other days counted Umaya?

33
00:07:36,086 --> 00:07:38,907
Not yet But this year the Gods are gold

34
00:07:38,957 --> 00:07:43,145
When you put the Gods and Prophet together,
its a pretty bit deal

35
00:07:43,195 --> 00:07:47,053
Oh, more Gods in the place of Kabbaah

36
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:53,193
Caravans from Syria

37
00:07:57,112 --> 00:07:57,931
mm They must be in running Very thirsty

38
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,630
Put 5 more men in North Wells

39
00:08:01,684 --> 00:08:04,336
How many sheeps will I have to kill for them? 70?

40
00:08:04,388 --> 00:08:06,641
Give them a 100

41
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:08,977
Macca should keep her name
for hospitality

42
00:08:09,027 --> 00:08:12,486
And 10 lambs for the leaders

43
00:08:22,343 --> 00:08:25,529
Bread and water, do the poets have in the Hakim's house

44
00:08:25,581 --> 00:08:29,939
Where verse and prose are nightly
put to slaughter

45
00:08:34,091 --> 00:08:39,383
And and the bread, I swear in there,
is thinner than the water

46
00:08:41,501 --> 00:08:45,484
Oh, open the space Open the space,
you lovers of poetry

47
00:08:45,506 --> 00:08:48,374
to Abu Sufian, willing and which

48
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,902
patron of the art

49
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:59,220
When Abu Sufian invites the poet in, there joy is
kids and love is kin

50
00:08:59,257 --> 00:09:03,115
where wines and cakes abound
the skills of Abu Sufian

51
00:09:03,195 --> 00:09:11,798
All revels and all songs begin
when Abu Sufian invites the poet in

52
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,975
Roman silk, worms of China, my lady,

53
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:36,891
a pleasure to the lin, and as my lady can see,
ravish to the eyes

54
00:09:40,808 --> 00:09:42,902
Yes 7 lengths
20 dinars

55
00:09:44,713 --> 00:09:48,468
Abu Sufian's wife? 15!

56
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:15,699
Oh, gold!
the gods of the Kabbaah have their needs

57
00:10:15,719 --> 00:10:17,073
They are Acives

58
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:31,692
Who is that man who stood there,
who looked into my soul?

59
00:10:34,476 --> 00:10:35,625
Cut me away from here

60
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:43,276
Why did Muhammad come down here?

61
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,277
Why don't you stop him?

62
00:10:45,323 --> 00:10:46,312
He is your nephew

63
00:10:46,357 --> 00:10:48,644
Maybe he will change!

64
00:10:48,694 --> 00:10:49,342
Change?

65
00:10:54,801 --> 00:10:57,748
He is 40 years old
Its unnatural, with a rich wife he could afford the best of Mecca

66
00:10:57,772 --> 00:11:01,277
If he chooses to sit shivering in a cave,

67
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:03,130
it is unnatural

68
00:11:03,178 --> 00:11:05,898
For a man who dares to risk the anger of

69
00:11:05,949 --> 00:11:11,707
Lath-Uzza, who keeps our health,
Mannat, the god of our prosperity,

70
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:20,761
Allot, the god of our family and tribes
and Hubar, 

71
00:11:20,801 --> 00:11:23,690
Hubar, who starts our caravans
and predicts our fate

72
00:11:23,737 --> 00:11:27,492
To challenge the gods within a year
sort of the gods is dangerous

73
00:11:27,542 --> 00:11:28,623
Unreasonable

74
00:11:28,677 --> 00:11:30,929
Rebellious, blasphemous

75
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,942
Yes, I'm afraid Muhammad will harm himself

76
00:11:49,603 --> 00:11:52,357
I am always sad
when the great fair is over

77
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:55,661
I might not see the next one

78
00:12:00,984 --> 00:12:02,804
Abu Talib! Abu Talib!

79
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:06,714
Catch your breath, Zaid!

80
00:12:06,758 --> 00:12:09,353
Has Muhammad come down from the mountain yet?

81
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:10,942
He's been there for 3 days

82
00:12:10,996 --> 00:12:15,662
No No, I haven't seen him

83
00:12:15,703 --> 00:12:19,195
Khadija hoped he might have come to you 
on his way home

84
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,994
Maybe he's still up there

85
00:12:22,077 --> 00:12:24,729
3 days 

86
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:35,915
I'm afraid for him on the mountain
because I don't know what it means

87
00:12:38,464 --> 00:12:41,855
Men see the world too well from a mountain

88
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:18,462
Muhammad! Read!

89
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:23,751
In the name of the Lord who created 
man from his sensitive drop of blood

90
00:13:23,755 --> 00:13:28,432
teaches man what he knows not

91
00:13:28,494 --> 00:13:30,781
Read!

92
00:14:10,847 --> 00:14:15,706
He's still trembling under the blanket, but he has spoken

93
00:14:15,753 --> 00:14:20,145
Zaid! What happened to my nephew on the mountain?

94
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:32,562
He was alone in the cave
Suddenly an angel came on to him,

95
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:40,879
The angel said: Read!
Muhammad replied: I can not read  

96
00:14:40,917 --> 00:14:48,189
The angle commanded again: Read!

97
00:14:48,227 --> 00:14:53,496
In the name of our Lord
who created man from his sensitive drop of blood

98
00:14:53,501 --> 00:14:59,463
who teaches man what he knows not: Read!

99
00:14:59,508 --> 00:15:04,162
Who knows if it was Gabriel!

100
00:15:04,213 --> 00:15:08,207
It could have been a dream

101
00:15:10,688 --> 00:15:13,783
When Muhammad was coming from the mountain
He saw Gabriel cleanly

102
00:15:13,826 --> 00:15:17,251
in the shape of a man
standing on the horizon

103
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:22,918
Wherever he looked, upon every turn of his head
he saw him

104
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:38,083
Gabriel said to him again: I am Gabriel and 
you Muhammad are the Messenger of God

105
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:45,145
Who has he told about this?

106
00:15:45,199 --> 00:15:47,190
His Wife

107
00:15:47,234 --> 00:15:49,055
and Ali

108
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:53,666
And his friend Abu Bakr

109
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:55,290
And you?

110
00:15:55,344 --> 00:15:57,905
I am his adopted son

111
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,841
Be careful to whom you talk

112
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:10,751
Tell him his uncle who protected him
when he was a child will protect him still

113
00:16:10,797 --> 00:16:15,223
After all, they say the God of Moses

114
00:16:15,269 --> 00:16:19,320
spoke to him under the burning bush

115
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:28,273
If you do not restrain your nephew, then we will

116
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:31,948
He's dividing the city, heart against hopes
He's dividing the generations,

117
00:16:31,956 --> 00:16:33,834
child against parent

118
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:39,059
The young are listening to him, he attract the yound

119
00:16:41,369 --> 00:16:46,763
We are Arabs We obey our fathers
Our children cannot be our teachers

120
00:16:48,177 --> 00:16:50,566
How can we accept that 
the man we met in the street yesterday

121
00:16:50,613 --> 00:16:54,368
can be some God's Prophet today?

122
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:57,877
Dead ones can live again, he says

123
00:16:57,923 --> 00:17:00,392
because he who created man 

124
00:17:00,393 --> 00:17:03,864
can also make man return from the dead, he says

125
00:17:03,931 --> 00:17:07,823
The Gods might leave us and 
give their benefits to another city

126
00:17:11,472 --> 00:17:19,176
Tell him we will give him authority, position,
and key to the Kabbaah,

127
00:17:20,251 --> 00:17:22,207
and money what money he wants

128
00:17:25,824 --> 00:17:28,646
Tell him we will give him anything he wants

129
00:17:53,192 --> 00:17:57,755
Muhammad, spare yourself and me

130
00:17:57,797 --> 00:18:02,690
Do not put a great burden on
an old man who can't bear

131
00:18:05,307 --> 00:18:07,799
In your childhood, you were in my arms,

132
00:18:07,844 --> 00:18:16,948
I cannot see you hurt
If you refuse them, they will hurt you

133
00:18:32,107 --> 00:18:33,426
He said this to me:

134
00:18:33,475 --> 00:18:38,140
Were they to put sun in my right hand
and the moon in my left

135
00:18:39,717 --> 00:18:43,711
I would not renounce my message
which is from God

136
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:51,305
When I am dead, you may do as you please

137
00:18:51,365 --> 00:18:53,549
but last time in your life, 
you will believe your father

138
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,341
Why did you hurt your father?

139
00:18:55,403 --> 00:19:03,176
If I'd be drunk every day and played dice
every night, you'd call it high spirits

140
00:19:03,213 --> 00:19:05,067
You'll be more my brother than you are now

141
00:19:05,115 --> 00:19:07,641
You are all my children

142
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:20,194
I give you everything I could, but it seems
not to be enough

143
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:26,565
Muhammad gives me more, he give all the world more

144
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:28,463
Get him out of here father!

145
00:19:41,227 --> 00:19:43,879
Its not worth it He's our father

146
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:45,785
You torture him

147
00:19:54,644 --> 00:19:56,202
Wait Hudaifa, wait

148
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,275
How can they say its an invention, Musab

149
00:20:04,322 --> 00:20:05,574
when it isn't new?

150
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,843
In Mecca it's new

151
00:20:07,894 --> 00:20:12,923
If God has said it all before, to Noah, Moses, Jesus, to all of Prophets,
but people changed it, turned it, forgot it

152
00:20:20,810 --> 00:20:25,306
Now God said it to Muhammad again,
and it is new again

153
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:29,843
What is it?

154
00:20:30,989 --> 00:20:31,307
It Jafar

155
00:20:46,275 --> 00:20:47,390
What have you brought with you?

156
00:20:48,611 --> 00:20:49,795
The very word of God

157
00:20:59,358 --> 00:21:00,815
When the sun is overthrown

158
00:21:00,861 --> 00:21:03,477
when the stars fall

159
00:21:03,530 --> 00:21:06,318
when the mountains vanish

160
00:21:06,367 --> 00:21:10,555
when the camels bid with yound abandoned

161
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:13,599
When the wild beasts are herded together

162
00:21:13,643 --> 00:21:16,487
when the seas rise

163
00:21:16,546 --> 00:21:19,345
When the souls are sorted

164
00:21:19,383 --> 00:21:24,208
when the female infant who is buried alive

165
00:21:24,256 --> 00:21:25,872
asks for what crime she was killed

166
00:21:26,392 --> 00:21:29,578
when the books are opened

167
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,850
when the sky is torn away,

168
00:21:32,901 --> 00:21:39,603
then every soul will know what it has done

169
00:21:42,512 --> 00:21:47,200
You were there Jafar when God
gave him these words?

170
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,221
Dawn is coming up

171
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:16,645
Ammar you first, then you Jafar

172
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:21,131
Ammar, you keep your mother awake 
all night with worry


173
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:22,119
I am sorry father

174
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:22,957
Where were you?

175
00:23:23,005 --> 00:23:25,599
Have you been with Muhammad again?

176
00:23:29,713 --> 00:23:31,067
What will happen now?

177
00:23:35,888 --> 00:23:38,436
Forgive him It was my fault, I did it

178
00:23:38,490 --> 00:23:40,914
That God has helped us all our lives

179
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:45,648
If it fell, it could not help itself

180
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:48,260
What talks have you been listening to?

181
00:23:48,303 --> 00:23:55,302
The real god is unseen,
he's not made of clay

182
00:23:55,345 --> 00:24:02,309
Ammar, we see the Gods in the Kabbaah every day

183
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:05,005
I am afraid for you

184
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:10,279
You are listening to people who will hurt you

185
00:24:11,766 --> 00:24:13,518
I'm listening to Muhammad, mother

186
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:18,257
Muhammad is generous, yes He gives, he shares,

187
00:24:18,308 --> 00:24:23,804
he pass no man without a smile,
but he is spreading dangerous ideas

188
00:24:24,849 --> 00:24:27,466
Dangerous ideas that no man should start

189
00:24:29,621 --> 00:24:32,227
that the rich should not afload the poor,

190
00:24:32,225 --> 00:24:35,935
the strong should not oppress the weak
Are these dangerous ideas?

191
00:24:37,498 --> 00:24:38,852
Girls should not be forced into marriage,

192
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,186
but be able to choose or refuse

193
00:24:43,272 --> 00:24:46,219
But only tonight, he said to stop

194
00:24:46,243 --> 00:24:47,767
the burial of new-born girls

195
00:24:50,348 --> 00:24:53,374
I was fortunate, always fortunate with your mother

196
00:24:54,987 --> 00:24:59,812
Yes, but you know that you and I nearly never met Yassar

197
00:25:01,795 --> 00:25:03,786
and you were nearly never born

198
00:25:06,334 --> 00:25:11,295
I was to be buried
like my 2 sisters

199
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,835
but my father couldnt' do it
He couldn't do it at that time

200
00:25:20,985 --> 00:25:22,840
When the second girl was buried,

201
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:29,655
when my father was putting sand over her,

202
00:25:32,133 --> 00:25:39,166
finger raised him as do babies,
told her mother afterwards

203
00:25:39,209 --> 00:25:45,377
she took hold of his finger the way baby does
He told my mother afterwards, that it was a minute before the tender little grip eased

204
00:25:48,286 --> 00:25:50,437
and he had taken away his hand

205
00:25:55,395 --> 00:25:59,685
When I was born, my father ran out of the house

206
00:25:59,734 --> 00:26:02,021
screaming that he couldn't do it again, 

207
00:26:02,071 --> 00:26:04,153
that he could never do it again

208
00:26:06,443 --> 00:26:09,231
Sumaya, it is the custom

209
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:16,916
But it is wrong 
The Gods that let such things be are no Gods

210
00:26:16,956 --> 00:26:21,747
I promised to go to Muhammad's house mama
and pray there

211
00:26:21,795 --> 00:26:25,186
Yes! He is a good man

212
00:26:31,607 --> 00:26:34,293
Yes, yes, you go

213
00:26:51,932 --> 00:26:53,082
Two men are following him

214
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:57,262
Read? 
Muhammad can neither write nor read

215
00:26:57,473 --> 00:26:58,622
Muhammad can speak

216
00:26:58,675 --> 00:27:01,895
What did you say?

217
00:27:01,945 --> 00:27:07,646
He can speak? Well, so can you
So now, you speak up yound man

218
00:27:07,686 --> 00:27:09,803
What does Muhammad say umm?

219
00:27:09,855 --> 00:27:12,575
They are God's words, not his

220
00:27:14,361 --> 00:27:21,292
Which god's? What words?
A speaking god?

221
00:27:23,505 --> 00:27:26,430
Your Muhammad speaks only to himself

222
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:31,806
When god reveals his message to Muhammad,

223
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,307
he remembers every word and
then he tells it to those who can write

224
00:27:34,353 --> 00:27:36,174
It is the Qur'an

225
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:43,083
Muhammad has starved himself into dreams, 
he hides under a blanket with his eyes shut

226
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:45,884
His eyes are shut but his heart is open

227
00:27:45,934 --> 00:27:48,927
You! kick him for his cleverness

228
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:50,427
There, is no need for hasts

229
00:27:53,276 --> 00:27:58,135
Doesn't Muhammad realize that we live by housing
to the Gods?

230
00:27:58,182 --> 00:28:00,299
We own the Kabbaah

231
00:28:00,352 --> 00:28:05,814
Every year, the tribes of Arabia come here
to Mecca to pray and to buy from us

232
00:28:07,795 --> 00:28:11,823
Now, were we to replace 300
gods with just one?

233
00:28:11,867 --> 00:28:15,895
whom we cannot even see, was supposed to be in Taif and Medina,

234
00:28:15,938 --> 00:28:19,761
here in my house, in Jerusalem, on the moon?

235
00:28:22,846 --> 00:28:24,701
Where would Mecca be then?

236
00:28:26,484 --> 00:28:29,443
The gods are both our vision and our revenue

237
00:28:29,488 --> 00:28:32,674
You cannot buy and sell God

238
00:28:32,726 --> 00:28:35,878
Young man, you are close to be whipped

239
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:39,753
Ammar, be sensible boy

240
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:41,326
I have a question

241
00:28:41,370 --> 00:28:46,399
Muhammad teaches you,
a slave is equal to his master

242
00:28:49,079 --> 00:28:52,038
This black Bilal, I paid money for is equal to me?

243
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:58,945
Yes Muhammad says before God all
men are equal as the teeth of a gum

244
00:29:00,461 --> 00:29:05,149
This is a very pleasant idea to slaves and beggars 
It gives them pretensions

245
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:15,443
Bilal! Teach this man the difference between the Lord of Mecca and a slave
Take that whip

246
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:22,581
Lash his face to teach an enormous lesson

247
00:29:30,999 --> 00:29:33,820
Whip him! Whip him!

248
00:29:33,869 --> 00:29:35,087
Cut him!

249
00:29:39,943 --> 00:29:40,659
Whip him!

250
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:49,603
Do it Bilal!

251
00:30:02,438 --> 00:30:04,929
Obey them! They will kill you!

252
00:30:11,116 --> 00:30:12,697
So you want anarchy to bring

253
00:30:13,718 --> 00:30:15,266
They even infected our slaves

254
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:22,491
If you're human enough to have gods,
remember that there are gods for your owner

255
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,989
I bought humanity Bilal
when I bought you

256
00:30:28,137 --> 00:30:29,719
You will be corrected

257
00:30:42,455 --> 00:30:46,381
One, one god

258
00:30:46,427 --> 00:30:50,421
There is only one God

259
00:30:50,465 --> 00:30:56,223
Who is stronger now, your master
or this one god of yours?

260
00:30:56,305 --> 00:31:02,530
One god There is only one God

261
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,502
Bring the stones

262
00:31:04,549 --> 00:31:12,982
One god, One god! One god!

263
00:31:13,027 --> 00:31:22,267
Crush him!

264
00:31:37,991 --> 00:31:39,015
Are you finished with him?

265
00:31:41,963 --> 00:31:43,078
There is only one God!

266
00:31:43,131 --> 00:31:46,351
You could swear the slave was preaching!

267
00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:48,826
Lord Umaya!

268
00:31:55,179 --> 00:31:58,866
Abu Bakr will pay 100 dinars for this slave

269
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,565
Wait now!

270
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:04,249
It's against our social order
to sell a slave during his punishment

271
00:32:04,290 --> 00:32:05,940
The offer is to Lord Umaya!

272
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:08,245
200

273
00:32:08,296 --> 00:32:16,296
If the price of slaves is raised,
we shall have to pay ourselves next year

274
00:32:24,116 --> 00:32:28,747
Take him He is no use to me anymore
Kill him or take him more I'm finished with him

275
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:35,712
We are declaring ourselves

276
00:32:35,763 --> 00:32:39,416
God has told his messenger to declare Islam to all men

277
00:32:39,468 --> 00:32:41,221
Open the windows!

278
00:32:41,270 --> 00:32:43,124
Let the world hear

279
00:32:47,144 --> 00:32:49,864
We are coming out of the darkness 

280
00:33:03,131 --> 00:33:08,628
Hear well the word of God
Hear well the messenger of Lord

281
00:33:08,671 --> 00:33:16,239
There are no other Gods, but God and Muhammad is his messenger
We have come into light, join us on the way to the Kabbah

282
00:33:16,281 --> 00:33:21,447
God is most great, God is most great!

283
00:33:21,487 --> 00:33:26,494
God has no partner, we have come into light

284
00:33:26,527 --> 00:33:30,407
Join us on the way to Kabbah

285
00:33:39,844 --> 00:33:45,203
Muhammad and his rebellion called Islam 
are coming out

286
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:48,709
to fall our gods
and de-throw our religion

287
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:50,473
Don't let them reach the Kabbaah

288
00:33:50,523 --> 00:33:54,346
Throw them back! Defend your gods

289
00:34:01,204 --> 00:34:16,351
There is no gods but God and
Muhammad is the messenger of God

290
00:34:16,389 --> 00:34:28,539
Protect the prophet!

There is no gods but God and
Muhammad is the messenger of God

There is no gods but God and
Muhammad is the messenger of God

291
00:34:37,016 --> 00:34:41,874
Guards!

292
00:34:47,829 --> 00:34:49,387
God is great!

293
00:34:49,430 --> 00:34:53,037
Blasphemy! ldiot!

294
00:34:53,068 --> 00:34:56,630
God is great!

295
00:35:07,654 --> 00:35:23,677
There is no gods but God and
Muhammad is the messenger of God

296
00:35:31,717 --> 00:35:34,539
Now's the time to break them,
there are only 30 of them

297
00:35:35,555 --> 00:35:40,255
No! we've done enough
More will only create sympathy for them

298
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:59,756
God is great!

299
00:36:01,888 --> 00:36:05,837
In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful

300
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,503
say: O you who reject faith
I worship not other

301
00:36:11,166 --> 00:36:11,951
Get out of Kabbaah!

302
00:36:13,937 --> 00:36:16,861
Silence, you'r a false prophet! Stop!

303
00:36:20,177 --> 00:36:20,893
Back to the corner!

304
00:36:36,431 --> 00:36:38,150
Hamza! Hamza!

305
00:37:29,264 --> 00:37:30,788
You are brave

306
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:37,334
He is the bravest man in the desert 
and he meets men unarmed

307
00:37:37,374 --> 00:37:39,899
Muhammad is a liar

308
00:37:39,944 --> 00:37:43,199
Liar? If you don't let him speak!

309
00:37:45,017 --> 00:37:48,840
Where's the lie and where's the truth
when it hasn't been spoken yet?

310
00:37:48,889 --> 00:37:50,572
Muhammad is a fraud

311
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,751
Stand up! Hit me back if you dare!

312
00:38:01,972 --> 00:38:06,364
I affirm my nephew's religion
and I say what he says

313
00:38:08,647 --> 00:38:11,332
Who ever has the courage to fight,
to fight with me!

314
00:38:40,387 --> 00:38:50,458
Muhammed, when I hunt the desert at night,
I know that God is not kept in a house

315
00:38:57,808 --> 00:39:05,808
Who'd have thought that Hamza, Hamza above all,
with his wine drinking, lion hunting

316
00:39:05,851 --> 00:39:08,002
will come to join Muhammad?

317
00:39:08,322 --> 00:39:13,044
More we attack, more seem to join him

318
00:39:14,964 --> 00:39:16,818
Where does he find his words?

319
00:39:16,865 --> 00:39:19,187
I don't know

320
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:23,754
How can an illiterate man go up on a mountain

321
00:39:23,774 --> 00:39:28,508
and come back 3 days later blazing with poetry?

322
00:39:30,415 --> 00:39:35,377
It wasn't just only poetry, he says it's God's

323
00:39:38,525 --> 00:39:42,611
How do we fight someone
whose strength we do not understand?

324
00:39:42,665 --> 00:39:48,980
Muhammad promises heaven, trees in the skies
It's natural he found audience

325
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:52,862
Then we must make that audience 
less eager to listen to him

326
00:39:52,910 --> 00:39:55,891
We will begin with the weaker ones

327
00:40:36,465 --> 00:40:37,477
Have mercy!

328
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:38,819
Left hand!

329
00:41:22,423 --> 00:41:24,539
Who is your God? Answer me!

330
00:41:24,592 --> 00:41:27,983
Say it! Say who is your God?

331
00:41:28,063 --> 00:41:28,973
Say it!

332
00:41:28,997 --> 00:41:35,529
There is only one God and
Muhammad is the messenger of God

333
00:43:43,533 --> 00:43:44,545
Ammar!

334
00:43:45,936 --> 00:43:50,340
Your father and mother are the first martyrs of Islam

335
00:43:50,374 --> 00:43:52,741
You are promised Paradise

336
00:44:12,636 --> 00:44:14,695
How much are you men prepared to suffer?

337
00:44:17,408 --> 00:44:19,297
The Prophet has said we must leave Mecca

338
00:44:20,913 --> 00:44:26,614
If we stay, they will kill you
 One by one

339
00:44:26,653 --> 00:44:28,724
Mohamed says in Abinisia, there is a Christian King

340
00:44:28,756 --> 00:44:32,329
No man is wronged in his country

341
00:44:36,733 --> 00:44:39,919
We must leave now, today

342
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:16,076
Usman!

343
00:47:49,174 --> 00:47:49,754
Lord is great

344
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:51,728
Let us go

345
00:48:05,427 --> 00:48:07,543
We found their tracks and followed them

346
00:48:07,596 --> 00:48:09,087
But they just disappeared

347
00:48:11,501 --> 00:48:16,099
They were there, in the desert, under the vultures
And you let them escape you

348
00:48:16,141 --> 00:48:18,598
Escape? They vanished!

349
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,703
If Muhammed has stayed, then only the weakest are gone

350
00:48:22,749 --> 00:48:24,798
Weak or strong, they blacken our name

351
00:48:25,886 --> 00:48:28,242
We are honest merchants,  we buy and sell in good faith

352
00:48:28,290 --> 00:48:30,246
We cannot afford scandal

353
00:48:34,964 --> 00:48:35,680
Amr!

354
00:48:35,731 --> 00:48:38,155
You are a friend of Najjasi, the king?

355
00:48:38,201 --> 00:48:39,418
Yes

356
00:48:39,469 --> 00:48:41,051
can you use that friendship?

357
00:48:44,276 --> 00:48:46,062
I think I can bring them back

358
00:48:46,145 --> 00:48:47,920
Yes

359
00:48:50,817 --> 00:48:51,203
Abisinia...

360
00:48:51,552 --> 00:48:53,201
Rise up Amr

361
00:48:55,924 --> 00:49:00,112
Please, nothing you may ask for that we will not give

362
00:49:01,531 --> 00:49:06,253
Lion of Judah, I.. I don't know where to begin

363
00:49:08,773 --> 00:49:11,459
you have our friendship, begin there

364
00:49:13,245 --> 00:49:17,273
certain run-away slaves have escaped from us into your kingdom

365
00:49:17,317 --> 00:49:22,745
Slaves go back
or you agree to return your slaves back to us

366
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,612
there are however some free men among them

367
00:49:26,628 --> 00:49:26,980
Rebels

368
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:28,414
Rebels?

369
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,286
If there are disagreements in Arabia,
why am I not informed?

370
00:49:33,337 --> 00:49:35,420
They are rebels in religion

371
00:49:36,875 --> 00:49:40,368
at one time are another
all religions were rebellions

372
00:49:40,413 --> 00:49:44,874
The bodies of slaves of the world
if bidden are in-disposed

373
00:49:44,918 --> 00:49:50,950
But as Jesus Christ as a shepherd,
the souls of men are his sheep
 
374
00:49:50,993 --> 00:49:54,645
These are Arabs who have betrayed
the religion of their fathers

375
00:49:54,697 --> 00:49:59,227
they follow a lunatic they call.. Prophet

376
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:02,900
But I cannot put souls into chains
without hearing them

377
00:50:56,741 --> 00:50:59,802
good, they'r stiff.
Next they will hang them

378
00:51:06,521 --> 00:51:08,739
Do you not now yourself before your prophet?

379
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:13,421
Muhammad is a man,
We kneel only to God

380
00:51:13,462 --> 00:51:16,717
Where are Muhammad's miracles, Jafar?

381
00:51:16,766 --> 00:51:20,624
If he were a prophet,
he'd lit the sky with miracles

382
00:51:20,671 --> 00:51:28,307
indeed, this is true.
God has given his prophets
signs of miracles that we may recognize them

383
00:51:28,348 --> 00:51:32,012
The miracle of Muhammad is the Holy Qur'an

384
00:51:32,052 --> 00:51:37,651
A book! A book! Written by an illiterate
attributed to God

385
00:51:37,693 --> 00:51:39,979
I think the emperor's heard enough

386
00:51:40,029 --> 00:51:41,952
A mind full of pedicast

387
00:51:41,999 --> 00:51:46,425
When God set down
tons of fire upon the heads of christ of puzzles

388
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:51,000
so that they can speak the many languages of the world
that they knew not before

389
00:51:51,043 --> 00:51:55,697
But do such miracles happen in our time..

390
00:51:58,753 --> 00:52:01,575
I've heard enough. You've made a poor case

391
00:52:11,502 --> 00:52:13,755
When we suffered persecution in Mecca,

392
00:52:13,772 --> 00:52:15,455
Muhammad told us go to Abyssinia

393
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:18,193
the land of the righteous king,
where no man is wronged

394
00:52:18,244 --> 00:52:20,896
What they call persecution was fair punishment,

395
00:52:20,914 --> 00:52:22,461
that is order...

396
00:52:22,516 --> 00:52:24,336
Why did your prophet send you to me?

397
00:52:24,384 --> 00:52:27,172
Because you believe in the book of the one God as we do.

398
00:52:27,222 --> 00:52:30,647
He sent us because 
in your heart God will protect us

399
00:52:30,726 --> 00:52:34,106
Talking with him is like 
drawing water from a mirage

400
00:52:34,130 --> 00:52:37,817
But now, they'd let the judy on me listen to them, my friend.

401
00:52:46,312 --> 00:52:47,893
Go on!

402
00:52:52,019 --> 00:52:57,470
For years, we worshiped wood and stone,
images of our own manufacture

403
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:00,692
we lived in ignorance of God

404
00:53:00,764 --> 00:53:05,111
we had some earthly laws
and no heavenly laws.
The rich neglect the poor.

405
00:53:05,169 --> 00:53:07,967
And the natural pity of man

406
00:53:07,972 --> 00:53:11,409
thereby lifts up when his brother has fallen

407
00:53:11,477 --> 00:53:15,801
This is described by them as upsetting
social order

408
00:53:17,952 --> 00:53:27,625
To this inhumanity has come a man
whom god chose and in that we believe

409
00:53:37,877 --> 00:53:46,048
You've overcome. I beg you to collect yourself.

I speak of the messenger of god.
Muhammad teaches us to worship one god,

410
00:53:46,087 --> 00:53:51,048
to speak truth
to love our neighbors as ourselves,

411
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:55,418
to give charity, even a smile can be charity

412
00:53:55,465 --> 00:54:00,518
to protect women from misuse,
to shelter orphans

413
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:06,376
and to turn away from gods of Wood and stone

414
00:54:06,412 --> 00:54:09,621
I cannot be still and hear this blasphemy

415
00:54:09,683 --> 00:54:12,505
We are an ancient civilization,
to call our gods wood and stone

416
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:17,049
is to speak ignorantly of them

417
00:54:17,093 --> 00:54:22,987
The idol we home is not what we worship,
but the spirit that resides within the form

418
00:54:25,336 --> 00:54:28,795
I agree that idolatry is
not always fully understood

Thank you

419
00:54:33,947 --> 00:54:35,836
Now, let me bring him back to the women

420
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:40,402
God made woman to be the proper companion of man

421
00:54:40,422 --> 00:54:43,050
she is different but equal

422
00:54:43,092 --> 00:54:47,621
Equal? We buy them,
feed them, perl them,

423
00:54:47,631 --> 00:54:52,649
use them, distorb them, 
women equal to us?

424
00:54:59,312 --> 00:55:02,566
God created man from one male and one female

425
00:55:04,585 --> 00:55:08,113
Amr, you must respect the woman's womb that bore you

426
00:55:10,092 --> 00:55:12,049
Why are you 300 guards so tongue-tied?

427
00:55:12,061 --> 00:55:15,077
what is only god is rependent.

428
00:55:17,802 --> 00:55:20,579
God has spoken to us before

429
00:55:20,605 --> 00:55:24,167
through Abraham, Noah, Moses and through Jesus Christ.
Why should we so surprised when god speaks to us now through Muhammad?

430
00:55:27,948 --> 00:55:29,461
Who taught you those names?

431
00:55:29,483 --> 00:55:31,304
they are named in the Qur'an

432
00:55:31,352 --> 00:55:35,380
I knew Muhammad when he was an orphan minding sheep

433
00:55:35,424 --> 00:55:38,417
And you knew Christ as a carpenter

434
00:55:40,764 --> 00:55:44,223
What Christ says and
what your Muhammad says

435
00:55:44,268 --> 00:55:48,194
is like two raised from the same land

436
00:55:48,240 --> 00:55:51,995
They'r lieing to you
They deny Christ
You worship 3 gods they say, father son and holy ghost they'r saying

437
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:57,633
What do you say of Christ?

438
00:55:57,685 --> 00:56:01,782
They say God can not have a son,
Christ is not the Son of God

439
00:56:01,823 --> 00:56:04,042
speak to me of Christ

440
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:12,358
we say of Christ what our prophet has told us,
that god cast his holy spirit into 

441
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:17,502
the womb of a virgin named Mary and that
she conceived Christ the Apostle of God

442
00:56:17,543 --> 00:56:19,000
Apostol he says, not a son, not a son!

443
00:56:19,045 --> 00:56:25,941
What does your miracle, your Qur'an,
say of the breadth, by the Lord Jesus Christ?

444
00:56:27,356 --> 00:56:28,937
may I relate the words?

445
00:56:33,263 --> 00:56:34,549
Come closer to me

446
00:56:41,406 --> 00:56:44,524
In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful

447
00:56:47,814 --> 00:56:53,310
relate in the book, the story of Mary.
how she was grew away from her family

448
00:56:53,354 --> 00:56:58,919
to a place in the east.
How we sent her an angel called Gabriel who said:

449
00:56:58,929 --> 00:57:04,926
''I am a messenger from your God
to announce the birth of a holy son to you"

450
00:57:04,969 --> 00:57:10,466
she said: How shall I Mary have a son when no man has touched me?''

451
00:57:12,245 --> 00:57:15,818
And Gabriel replied: For your Lord says,

452
00:57:15,816 --> 00:57:21,632
it will happen"
"We appoint him as a sign on to man"

453
00:57:21,691 --> 00:57:28,986
and a mercy from us!
It is a thing or didn't"

454
00:57:56,000 --> 00:58:05,401
The difference between us and you
is not bigger than this line

455
00:58:11,486 --> 00:58:13,944
Not for a mountain of gold
will I give them up to you

456
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:25,023
you may live in Abyssinia in peace as long as you wish

457
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:29,667
May God's blessings be upon you when you return

458
00:58:37,252 --> 00:58:41,906
lntolerable! Mohamed disturbs 
even our foreign alliences

459
00:58:41,957 --> 00:58:46,657
Very well! we will make him give up on him

460
00:58:48,933 --> 00:58:51,994
Abu Talib has his arms around him

461
00:58:53,472 --> 00:59:01,506
Very well!  we will throw uncle and nephew out

462
00:59:01,549 --> 00:59:06,681
In one bundle, his whole family out
we will expel them from ourselves

463
00:59:07,790 --> 00:59:11,476
No merchant make trade with them,
no land remain to them

464
00:59:11,527 --> 00:59:13,985
no roof shelter them,
no beggar pay for them

465
00:59:13,997 --> 00:59:16,922
no woman marry them

466
00:59:16,968 --> 00:59:20,359
until they renounce their trend.

467
01:00:08,032 --> 01:00:11,127
These were the worst years of Muhammad's life

468
01:00:12,471 --> 01:00:16,568
For 3 years they suffered the hunger, thirst,

469
01:00:16,576 --> 01:00:23,040
cruelty of the open desert,
but the year of grief was still to come,

470
01:00:23,084 --> 01:00:27,943
when Khatija, Muhammad's wife for 24 years died,

471
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:32,645
when Abu Talib his old Protector died

472
01:00:32,696 --> 01:00:39,695
With his last breath Abu Talib tried again
to reconsile Mecca and Muhammad

473
01:00:39,738 --> 01:00:49,092
He never asked more from you,
when one word,

474
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:52,292
one.. one God

475
01:00:52,354 --> 01:00:55,745
If it was only a question of one word

476
01:00:55,758 --> 01:01:01,516
I'd have given him 10 words,
but the word he wants would dethrown all the gods

477
01:01:18,454 --> 01:01:28,263
You were afraid even to hear him

478
01:01:48,524 --> 01:01:51,119
with the death of his uncle, Muhammad has now

479
01:01:51,128 --> 01:01:55,611
lost all protection
He was no longer safe in Mecca

480
01:01:57,302 --> 01:02:02,025
Alone with Zaid, his adopted son, 
he went to the hillside town of Taif

481
01:02:02,075 --> 01:02:05,603
He asked to be taken in, to be allowed to preach

482
01:02:08,816 --> 01:02:12,913
But the children of Taif were turned loose to stone him back into the desert

483
01:02:15,792 --> 01:02:16,907
What are you doing?

484
01:02:22,300 --> 01:02:24,985
Stop! Stop! Leave him alone! Wait!

485
01:02:39,288 --> 01:02:42,474
Muhammad called this, the bitterest day of his life

486
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:47,904
Then miraculously, when Muhammad's mission 

487
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:51,937
seemed to have failed, his entire situation changed

488
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:55,413
A deputation from the rich, but self-destroying

489
01:02:55,441 --> 01:02:59,378
city of Medina met him by night at the Rock of Agaba

490
01:02:59,413 --> 01:03:02,838
asking him to come to them to stand between their factions

491
01:03:02,851 --> 01:03:07,778
to mediate their continual quarrels and civil wars

492
01:03:08,792 --> 01:03:11,864
Muhammad agreed, provided they gave him a pledge

493
01:03:11,895 --> 01:03:15,434
that they worship the one God only

494
01:03:15,466 --> 01:03:18,664
Wait! When we take this pledge

495
01:03:18,704 --> 01:03:22,857
we expel ourselves from the rest of Arabia.
So, wait!

496
01:03:26,380 --> 01:03:31,592
War is in this pledge.
We'll make enemies of brothers

497
01:03:31,620 --> 01:03:36,468
we'll make firewood of our gods
That is the meaning of the pledge

498
01:03:36,493 --> 01:03:41,170
If we take it, there can be no turning back

499
01:03:41,199 --> 01:03:46,012
for Muhammad is indeed the messenger of God
foretold to Jews in our city

500
01:03:46,072 --> 01:03:50,521
So if anyone has doubt in this pledge, go now

501
01:03:50,510 --> 01:03:54,743
and if you have no doubts then you do as I do

502
01:03:58,353 --> 01:04:04,021
I pledge myself to the one and only God
and to you Muhammad, the messenger of God

503
01:04:05,930 --> 01:04:08,752
He is of us and we are of him

504
01:04:10,368 --> 01:04:16,866
Leave him bring his followers,
our brothers, to use, to Medina

505
01:05:02,367 --> 01:05:06,054
It was a journey that changed the world

506
01:05:06,071 --> 01:05:08,097
The Hijrah of flight to Medina

507
01:05:08,141 --> 01:05:15,879
Only 70 people split up into small groups
walking 250 miles of desert

508
01:05:15,918 --> 01:05:20,743
yet, so profound with the consequences
so lasting with the effects of this walk

509
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:24,955
that from it the muslims take their calendar

510
01:05:25,996 --> 01:05:29,319
In this moment, Islam found its future

511
01:05:30,870 --> 01:05:33,179
Muhammad himself stayed in Mecca

512
01:05:33,206 --> 01:05:37,576
in the greatest danger until all his followers had left safely

513
01:06:03,444 --> 01:06:05,810
Muhammad has become a nation,

514
01:06:05,846 --> 01:06:10,193
he has received a city, entering into pledges and treaties

515
01:06:10,218 --> 01:06:15,613
and you Salool who claim to be king of Medina
lost the kingdom last night while you were in bed

516
01:06:15,659 --> 01:06:17,945
you should worry about yourself Abu Sufian

517
01:06:19,364 --> 01:06:24,359
Every time you trade a whif of perfume of the city,
you must creep past that man in Medina

518
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:29,229
he is across your merchantile throats as we speak

519
01:06:29,276 --> 01:06:31,325
And what do you intend to do?

520
01:06:31,379 --> 01:06:33,233
l intend to wait

521
01:06:33,281 --> 01:06:34,738
And how long will you wait?

522
01:06:34,783 --> 01:06:40,245
Till you and the rest of Arabia remove him
to save your way of life

523
01:06:40,290 --> 01:06:41,541
and while you wait?

524
01:06:41,591 --> 01:06:45,631
I should accept his call of course

525
01:06:45,663 --> 01:06:49,771
To think I will give him my birth-rite...
I will not..

526
01:06:52,038 --> 01:06:52,925
Medina is worth the conversion

527
01:06:53,005 --> 01:06:54,052
Hypocrisy

528
01:06:56,243 --> 01:06:58,235
Of course, its the healthy hypocrisy

529
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:05,408
King Salool, why put your head on the floor
5 times a day praying? I don't believe you

530
01:07:06,723 --> 01:07:10,546
He may not have to.
Well, we do know we should have done it before

531
01:07:11,729 --> 01:07:12,514
kill Muhammad

532
01:07:14,766 --> 01:07:16,142
Come!
Come and see

533
01:07:16,201 --> 01:07:18,853
They say that practice leads to perfection

534
01:07:29,518 --> 01:07:34,650
7 young men each from a different family,
my own son Ikrima is with them

535
01:07:34,691 --> 01:07:38,879
they will stab him together

536
01:07:45,171 --> 01:07:51,771
If the responsibility for his death
is shared, where lies the guilty? My idea

537
01:07:55,951 --> 01:07:57,408
I'm not sure I'm part of it

538
01:07:58,988 --> 01:08:05,589
Muhammad's body contains too much
his mind, his words
