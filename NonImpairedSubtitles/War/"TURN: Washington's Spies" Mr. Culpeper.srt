suggests that the garrison

This letter written by

It was a lone report

until our victories at Trenton and
Princeton proved it accurate.

- Great.

124

Thought you might have
trouble closer to the city.

They're still jumpy

126

And after
the rebels' victories,

127
00:08:57,704 --> 00:09:00,305
they see lone

<i>of my friend's</i>
<i>integrity and loyalty.</i>

136
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:27,799
Well, according to you, he took an
oath of loyalty to King George.

137
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:31,202
Only to get closer to the
enemy, to learn their secrets.

138
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,738
Traditional military
reconnaissance

139
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,574
is a proven discipline.

140
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:38,076
Multiple scouts
produce multiple reports

141
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:41,012
which may be cross-referenced
to ensure verification.

142
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,648
In addition, soldiers
are trained to recognize...

143
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:47,085
Actually, soldiers
make terrible spies.

144
00:09:47,087 --> 00:09:50,188
All that discipline
drilled into their movements

145
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,357
makes them easy to spot,

146
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,225
unlike us civilians.

147
00:09:54,227 --> 00:09:58,830
Excuse me, sir, but why
exactly are you in this room?

148
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,700
I've been invited here
by your commander in chief

149
00:10:01,702 --> 00:10:04,669
to opine on
the business at hand.

150
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:08,673
Mr. Sackett came to us
by way of William Duer,

151
00:10:08,675 --> 00:10:13,244
who recommended him as a person
of intrigue and secrecy.

152
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,080
And I must say,
I find this young man's

153
00:10:15,082 --> 00:10:17,983
<i>chain of agents</i>
<i>very intriguing.</i>

154
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:21,186
I want this chain notion
explored

155
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:24,055
and a unified recommendation
presented upon my return.

156
00:10:24,057 --> 00:10:26,057
Any questions?

157
00:10:26,059 --> 00:10:30,195
- I...
- Well, yes, Your Excellency.

158
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,930
The letter that I transcribed

159
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,065
regarding the Hessians
and Trenton.

160
00:10:34,067 --> 00:10:36,334
It was unsigned.

161
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:40,739
I mean to ask, how did you come

Ah, ah.

200

I've been tracking a man

just one of them, four months...

241
00:15:54,587 --> 00:15:57,956

<i>Now, it's nothing personal.</i>
<i>That's just the rules.</i>

Oh, yeah, I will.

00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:08,733
But before all that,
I just wanna ask ya,

246
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:13,104
where the hell did you learn
how to use staves like this?

247
00:16:13,106 --> 00:16:17,208
I have seen all manner
of lethality,

something new today.

00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,746
I'm Maasai.

250
00:16:21,748 --> 00:16:24,549
We train with <i>fimbos</i>
<i>for initiation.</i>

00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:29,620
Go on, then. Show me.

253
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:33,391
Only warriors are initiated.

254
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,763
I have been a warrior
for 30 years, boy.

255
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:40,264
( Chuckles )

256
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:42,233
Let me put him down, Major.

257
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:45,370
Drop your iron.
I'll make you my meat.

258
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:47,372
While you dream, snowball.

259
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,307
We'll have a fair fight, then.

260
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:51,576
The lads'll make a little coin,

261
00:16:51,578 --> 00:16:56,147
and you and he will get the
answer you're looking for, eh?

262
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:02,420
So she then hangs a black
petticoat on a drying line

263
00:17:02,422 --> 00:17:05,690
to signal to my courier when
the intelligence is ready.

264
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:08,126
- Not bad.
- And she hangs napkins

265
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:11,262
to signify which cove
is safe for the rendezvous.

266
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:13,197
Wait, wait. Rendezvous?

267
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,667
Don't tell me your agent meets
your courier in person?

268
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:19,570
Oh, well, of course.

269
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,572
Failure. Death.

270
00:17:21,574 --> 00:17:24,208
No, no, no. Courier and agent

271
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,110
are never in the same
place at the same time.

272
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:30,081
Well, then how do you expect
for them to make the transfer?

273
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,618
( Sighs ) You
predetermine the location

274
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,087
to drop, <i>id est,</i> hide

275
00:17:36,089 --> 00:17:39,657
the <i>lettre confidentielle</i>
<i>in question</i>

276
00:17:39,659 --> 00:17:43,494
and then arrange
a later time for retrieval.

277
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:47,065
A dead drop...

278
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:50,468
to ensure your agents
don't drop dead

279
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:54,639
from being caught
<i>in flagrante delicto.</i>

280
00:17:54,641 --> 00:17:57,308
Which demonstrates
the folly of this scheme.

281
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:01,112
If a single link is broken, the
entire chain is rendered useless.

282
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:04,215
Which is why
we use encryption, sir.

283
00:18:04,217 --> 00:18:07,418
To shield the men,
not the message.

284
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,686
( Chuckles )

285
00:18:08,688 --> 00:18:10,721
Captain, which
enciphering method

286
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:12,457
have you been using thus far?

287
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:15,093
Rossignol? Trithemius?

288
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:17,628
Personally, I prefer Dumas.

289
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,338
Please tell me
you're using encryption.

290
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,141
My God.

291
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:32,643
I was told you were
a graduate of Yale.

292
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:34,679
Yes, sir. Class of '73.

293
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:36,414
Hmm.

294
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:39,717
One supposes you've studied
Greek, Latin, Hebrew?

295
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:42,186
<i>Nai. Certe. Chen-adon.</i>

296
00:18:42,188 --> 00:18:45,723
And I am a quick
study, Mr. Sackett.

297
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:49,293
Then at least we have
somewhere to start.

298
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,430
Commit this to memory.

299
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,831
Scott: <i>We don't
have time for this.</i>

300
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,400
The commander expects
results, not wordplay.

301
00:18:56,402 --> 00:18:59,804
But we're ahead of the game,
thanks to Captain Tallmadge here.

302
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:02,740
Typically, I have
to concoct a legend

303
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:05,877
for the agents I wish to
embed into enemy territory.

304
00:19:05,879 --> 00:19:07,812
A poultry trader,

305
00:19:07,814 --> 00:19:10,781
fishmonger, schoolteacher.

306
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:14,552
Requires wardrobe,
documentation, training.

307
00:19:14,554 --> 00:19:16,687
The brilliance of Mr. Woodhull

308
00:19:16,689 --> 00:19:20,191
is his life is his legend.

309
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,859
There's no reason
to invent a false one.

310
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:23,761
He's already living it.

311
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:26,864
- Who pays for it?
- Hmm?

312
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:29,800
Well, if the farmer's not farming,
who provides for his expenses?

313
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:35,339
His food, his lodging?
His money to bribe sources?

314
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,542
- ( Cracks nut )
- We do, of course.

315
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:41,679
The Congress will never
approve intelligencer salaries

316
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:44,649
while we cobble together
bounties for our regulars.

317
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:48,252
Congress needn't know about it.

318
00:19:48,254 --> 00:19:50,555
We'll draw from a secret fund

319
00:19:50,557 --> 00:19:53,658
authorized by Washington to
be used at our discretion.

320
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,360
General, please.

321
00:19:56,362 --> 00:19:59,497
We've been asked to explore how
a chain of agents might work.

322
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:02,700
Some debate is to be expected.

323
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,669
Explore whatever you want,
Tallmadge.

324
00:20:04,671 --> 00:20:07,805
As the head of intelligence,
I will never approve this.

325
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,343
It's time that you learned how
the chain of command works.

326
00:20:12,345 --> 00:20:14,212
- <i>( Door slams shut )</i>
<i>- Hmm.</i>

327
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,347
That was predictable.

328
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,517
Ah.

329
00:20:33,298 --> 00:20:34,799
( Gasps )

330
00:20:34,801 --> 00:20:40,938
Man singing: <i>♪ I sold my
flax, I sold my wheel ♪</i>

331
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:46,277
♪ To buy my love
a sword of steel ♪

332
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:52,550
♪ So it in battle
he might wield ♪

333
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:58,556
♪ Johnny's gone
for a soldier... ♪

334
00:20:58,558 --> 00:21:01,659
Listen, you.
You've made a mistake.

335
00:21:03,295 --> 00:21:05,796
You're shivering, Mr. Woodhull.

336
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,899
Here.

337
00:21:08,901 --> 00:21:10,568
This'll warm you up.

338
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,003
No, no, no.

339
00:21:12,005 --> 00:21:14,605
I am the son
of a Tory magistrate.

340
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,407
I'm a loyal subject
of the Crown.

341
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:19,477
You've gotta listen to me.
You've gotta listen.

342
00:21:19,479 --> 00:21:21,879
- ( Grunts )
- Little Tory boy.

343
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:24,849
( Coughing )

344
00:21:29,321 --> 00:21:32,790
I'm with the 19th
Continentals under Sullivan.

345
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:37,561
I've been out here
five months...

346
00:21:37,563 --> 00:21:40,031
the last man of my unit...

347
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:43,334
ambushing their dispatch
riders, hitting supply lines,

348
00:21:43,336 --> 00:21:47,338
all while looking for a way to
get back to the regiment proper.

349
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,441
<i>Only reason</i>
<i>you're still breathing</i>

350
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:53,744
is I got more questions
need answering

351
00:21:53,746 --> 00:21:58,349
about who you sell to
and where, at what price,

352
00:21:58,351 --> 00:22:01,085
anything they'll ask
at the checkpoints.

353
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:05,356
( Shivering ) You plan to
pass yourself off as me?

354
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:06,857
But that coat and that pin

355
00:22:06,859 --> 00:22:09,627
is as much a disguise
for me as it is for you.

356
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:12,363
I'm under direct orders
to infiltrate the city

357
00:22:12,365 --> 00:22:14,899
and gather intelligence
for the Continental Army.

358
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:17,935
- <i>I swear.</i>
<i>- Oh, I see.</i>

359
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,837
So...

360
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:21,565
you're a spy.

361
00:22:21,565 --> 00:22:25,697
Benjamin Tallmadge, Second
Continental Light Dragoons.

362
00:22:25,697 --> 00:22:29,947
He will confirm my loyalty and
he will verify my mission.

363
00:22:29,949 --> 00:22:33,084
Your mission?

364
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:37,054
( Sighs )

365
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:41,726
You're gonna tell me
what I need to know

366
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:45,529
<i>or they'll find your body</i>

367
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:48,599
<i>liberated of its skin.</i>

368
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:55,940
What, you know them all,
trust them all?

369
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:57,842
We all grew up together.

370
00:22:57,844 --> 00:22:59,877
Childhood friends. Fascinating.

371
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,879
Wouldn't have thought
to try that.

372
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,781
Well, it wasn't
exactly planned.

373
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,850
( Quietly )
Don't tell anyone that.

374
00:23:05,852 --> 00:23:09,620
Don't tell anyone else
Mr. Woodhull's name.

375
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:15,960
Time to gift
Mr. Woodhull an alias.

376
00:23:15,962 --> 00:23:19,730
One by which the other
agents will know him.

377
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:23,067
I'm sorry, the other agents?

378
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:26,003
Hmm, I've plans
for your farmer.

379
00:23:26,838 --> 00:23:30,408
<i>Need him to nurture the seeds</i>

380
00:23:30,410 --> 00:23:34,111
<i>I've planted over</i>
<i>the last year and a half.</i>

381
00:23:34,113 --> 00:23:38,115
<i>One of them</i>
<i>is sprouting right now,</i>

382
00:23:38,117 --> 00:23:41,419
<i>right under the enemy's nose.</i>

383
00:23:44,122 --> 00:23:46,957
I... no, I'm sorry,
but I'm afraid that's

384
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:48,559
not how this is going to work.

385
00:23:48,561 --> 00:23:50,661
You see, Abe,
he's a very cautious man.

386
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:53,431
He won't meet with anybody
he doesn't already know.

387
00:23:53,433 --> 00:23:56,534
- He'll have to.
- No, he'll quit is what he'll do.

388
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,502
I thought he was your friend.

389
00:23:58,504 --> 00:24:01,705
Yes, which is exactly why
he trusts me to protect him.

390
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:05,910
Only that which
is concealed is protected.

391
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:09,113
<i>You can't even</i>
<i>conceal his name.</i>

392
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:16,587
<i>Luckily for you, I am a master
at the art of concealment.</i>

393
00:24:24,830 --> 00:24:27,164
Thank you, Lieutenant Terrence.

394
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:28,966
I have an uncle
in the Coldstream Guard,

395
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:32,102
so he'll be glad we've
reclaimed one of his own.

396
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:35,973
I remember the motto...
<i>"Nulli Secundam."</i>

397
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,175
Second to none.

398
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:50,254
Good evening, sir. Have a seat.

399
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:54,258
- Name and rank.
- Captain John Graves Simcoe.

400
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,694
And where was your post?

401
00:24:56,696 --> 00:24:59,129
A town called Setauket.

402
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:00,998
Setauket, Long Island?

403
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:05,169
Ambush, was it not?

404
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:08,706
Where are my manners. Drink?

405
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,875
( Rings )

406
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,781
And how did you
find it there in Setauket?

407
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:20,618
May I have some more ink,
please, Abigail?

408
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:23,587
This is for military record?

409
00:25:23,589 --> 00:25:26,957
Oh, my own personal curiosity.

410
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,659
It's a pit

411
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:31,161
run by a man who I'd say...

412
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:36,233
well, best not
to talk out of turn.

413
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:38,135
Hewlett?

414
00:25:38,137 --> 00:25:40,804
"The Oyster Major," as he's
referred to in these parts.

415
00:25:40,806 --> 00:25:42,640
( Chuckles )

416
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:46,010
If you'd like, I could see
to arranging a transfer.

417
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:49,547
Please, Major,
not on my account.

418
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:53,250
There's someone whom I
left far too abruptly.

419
00:25:53,252 --> 00:25:54,919
A local woman, perhaps?

420
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:58,689
In any case, I should very
much like to return to her.

421
00:25:58,691 --> 00:26:01,158
By all means.

422
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,761
Tell me about her.

423
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:14,738
Well, I'm all packed up.

424
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:17,174
<i>Tell me what I need to know</i>

425
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:20,077
<i>or I kill that fire 'fore I go.</i>

426
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:24,682
No? Have it your way, then.

427
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:33,057
( Mumbling ) My... my
father's Richard Woodhull.

428
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:41,999
His deal is with Colonel Cook
for seven pounds per pound.

429
00:26:42,001 --> 00:26:45,769
Now, was that so hard?

430
00:26:45,771 --> 00:26:48,305
Tell me true...

431
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,240
if you're such a Patriot,

432
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:52,076
why didn't you enlist
with the militia

433
00:26:52,078 --> 00:26:54,378
and fight for your
country like a man?

434
00:26:56,748 --> 00:26:59,283
Because you can't win.

435
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,988
Look at you.

436
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,990
Look at your...

437
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,360
your fort here.

438
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,864
You're one man.

439
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,369
You're alone in the woods...

440
00:27:20,238 --> 00:27:24,008
surrounded by an army

441
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:26,777
on an island
surrounded by a navy.

442
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:30,781
That... that is
the Continental Army.

443
00:27:32,017 --> 00:27:34,351
That is what you're
running back to.

444
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,423
So I should be like you, then?

445
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:42,693
Swear allegiance to the king with
my fingers crossed behind me?

446
00:27:42,695 --> 00:27:45,262
What's your family
think of you?

447
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,168
( Scoffs )

448
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:54,672
What I do, I do for my son.

449
00:27:55,907 --> 00:27:59,076
He know you're a liar?

450
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:03,313
He's a year old.

451
00:28:03,315 --> 00:28:06,050
I want to be there for him
when he grows up.

452
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,954
Man: <i>If I had a son,
I'd have him know</i>

453
00:28:10,956 --> 00:28:13,090
<i>I fought and died</i>
<i>for my beliefs</i>

454
00:28:13,092 --> 00:28:17,194
so he could rise to avenge me.

455
00:28:17,196 --> 00:28:19,963
I'd want my son
to choose for himself...

456
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,901
rather than have
his father choose for him.

457
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:26,170
But then our...

458
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:29,373
views on liberty...

459
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:33,277
true liberty... may differ.

460
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:40,050
You say you need this suit,
this pin, and this paper.

461
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:43,253
I'll do you a deal.

462
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,060
Fight me for them.

463
00:28:58,169 --> 00:28:59,503
Come on!

464
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:01,305
I don't want to fight you.

465
00:29:01,307 --> 00:29:05,943
Oh, don't worry. I'll
let you warm up first.

466

You think you
deserve this more?

- Prove it.
- We're on the same side.

468
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,951
Prove you're worth more.

469
00:29:13,953 --> 00:29:15,786
- No, I won't.
- You fight me.

470
00:29:15,788 --> 00:29:18,222
- I'm not worth more.
- You fight me.

00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:11,041
Soldier: <i>Come around
to the left, men!</i>

480
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:19,817
No, he's the captive!

481
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:25,222
There he is!

482
00:30:26,858 --> 00:30:30,360
Surrender! You are
alone and outnumbered.

483
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,999
Man: <i>You were right,
Mr. Woodhull.</i>

484
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:38,502
<i>You Tory bastard!</i>

485
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,907
( yells )

486
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:58,255
It's over now. You're safe.

487
00:30:58,257 --> 00:31:01,491
<i>Tough nut, that one.</i>

488
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,862
( laughing )

489
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:06,563
Oh, it's a long story.
Too long.

490
00:31:06,565 --> 00:31:08,866
- Do tell, tell.
- Soldier: Tell, tell.

491
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,334
<i>( Soldiers tapping )</i>

492
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,969
Very well, very well.

493
00:31:11,971 --> 00:31:14,238
You see, I, too,
was once taken prisoner.

494
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:17,174
Not long after
I arrived in America

495
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:20,077
during the defense
of Fort Saint-Jean.

496
00:31:21,312 --> 00:31:25,349
I took it upon myself to write
down everything that I saw...

497
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:28,385
troop movements,
gun placements.

498
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:31,288
I even drew a detailed map
of the territory.

499
00:31:31,290 --> 00:31:33,090
You must be quite the artist.

500
00:31:33,092 --> 00:31:35,592
I dabble.

501
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:37,527
My reports were sent
to General Howe

502
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:39,997
and, impressed
with my initiative,

503
00:31:39,999 --> 00:31:41,465
he assigned me to a new post.

504
00:31:41,467 --> 00:31:46,169
So you see, I understand
the value of men in chains.

505
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:50,674
Thus it falls to me
to interrogate our returned.

506
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:52,676
Though I do prefer
to compare multiple accounts.

507
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:55,412
That way, if something
is suspect...

508
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:59,182
it's easier to spot.

509
00:32:01,486 --> 00:32:05,255
As an artist, I've learned that
it's not always the big picture,

510
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:07,090
but the little details

511
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:09,993
that effectively sell the tale.

512
00:32:09,995 --> 00:32:13,397
Another line of the old
author, Lieutenant Terrence?

513
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:21,138
Lieutenant Terrence here
is a Coldstream man.

514
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,441
I propose a toast for

515
00:32:24,443 --> 00:32:27,277
one of Colonel Mathew's finest.

516
00:32:28,046 --> 00:32:29,613
<i>Nulli Secundam.</i>

517
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:34,084
<i>Secundus.</i>

518
00:32:43,061 --> 00:32:44,661
What the hell have you done?

519
00:32:44,663 --> 00:32:46,964
This man's a liar.

520
00:32:48,366 --> 00:32:50,400
Coldstream lieutenant

521
00:32:50,402 --> 00:32:53,337
not knowing
his regiment's motto.

522
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,207
He was likely sent
back to us as a spy.

523
00:32:57,209 --> 00:32:59,209
I know that!

524
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:03,246
You pale fool.

525
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:04,748
I had planned on
turning him double,

526
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,451
the opportunity of which
I have now been robbed.

527
00:33:07,453 --> 00:33:10,721
I apologize, Major.
I just thought...

528
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:12,422
You didn't think.

529
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:14,491
You acted upon the assumption
that you were the only one

530
00:33:14,493 --> 00:33:17,494
who could spot
a mouse in the cupboard.

531
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:21,631
Has it really been that
long since your last kill

532
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:25,268
or was violence
your natural inclination?

533
00:33:30,708 --> 00:33:33,543
Go back to Setauket, Captain.

534
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:38,015
I pray that woman can
settle your savage side.

535
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,577
General, have we
come to a consensus?

536
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:11,548
Your Excellency, we believe
traditional reconnaissance

537
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:13,116
is the way forward

538
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:15,485
as it depends on as little
variable as possible

539
00:34:15,487 --> 00:34:19,156
and would be carried out by men who
could be trusted to follow orders.

540
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:25,362
Captain, what say you?

541
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,432
I...

542
00:34:28,434 --> 00:34:30,300
I concur with the general, sir.

543
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:31,735
( Scoffs )

544
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:36,273
The chain of agents approach
would require trust

545
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,575
and in that resource,

546
00:34:38,577 --> 00:34:41,611
I'm afraid we find
ourselves lacking.

547
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:48,185
You're speaking now
of your men on Long Island.

548
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:51,621
No, sir, I'm speaking
of the men in this room.

549
00:34:55,860 --> 00:35:00,397
Sir, for a conspiracy
like this one to function,

550
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:02,232
we would need to be
keeping secrets

551
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,234
from the enemy, from Congress,

552
00:35:04,236 --> 00:35:06,603
even from our own army.

553
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:11,108
This would require
absolute trust

554
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:12,742
amongst the secret-keepers,

555
00:35:12,744 --> 00:35:14,744
and yet General Scott here

556
00:35:14,746 --> 00:35:17,481
<i>does not trust me</i>
<i>or my judgment.</i>

557
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:20,283
<i>Mr. Sackett here
mistrusts my experience,</i>

558
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:22,352
<i>much as I mistrust his attitude</i>

559
00:35:22,354 --> 00:35:25,288
toward the lives
of the agents in the field.

560
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:28,225
And you, sir...

561
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:31,828
<i>you know the name</i>
<i>Abraham Woodhull</i>

562
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,664
and yet you will not
disclose to me

563
00:35:34,666 --> 00:35:36,900
the source of your knowing.

564
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:40,704
Apparently, you do not
trust me either.

565
00:35:40,706 --> 00:35:43,373
Therefore, I cannot
trust the success

566
00:35:43,375 --> 00:35:46,543
of any chain that we
might build here today.

567
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:58,855
I would like to speak with
Captain Tallmadge alone.

568
00:36:04,795 --> 00:36:07,531
( Cheering )

569
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,934
( crowd stomping )

570
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:14,304
( cheering continues )

571
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:29,486

00:36:29,488 --> 00:36:32,455
( cheering )

573
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:46,703
( grunts )

574
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:50,273
( cheering continues )

575
00:37:03,788 --> 00:37:06,723
- ( yells )
- Hold!

576
00:37:10,795 --> 00:37:12,829
Shut your gobs!

577
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:15,732
<i>( Crowd quiets )</i>

578
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,302
You still gonna kill me?

579
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:24,774
Well, Rangers don't kill
their own initiates.

580
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,015
( Chuckles )

581
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:37,954
( exhales )

582
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:40,890
( speaking Abenaki )

583
00:37:51,335 --> 00:37:53,770
Samuel Tallmadge.

584
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:58,808
Samuel.

585
00:38:01,345 --> 00:38:03,880
Mr. Sackett tells me
that you prefer

586
00:38:03,882 --> 00:38:06,049
an alias for Woodhull.

587
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:08,518
I must say, I concur.

588
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,521
Forgive me, sir, but I
thought that we had agreed

589
00:38:11,523 --> 00:38:12,889
that the best way forward...

590
00:38:12,891 --> 00:38:14,691
You were right
in your prescription.

591
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:16,893
We require an amendment
in the name of trust.

592
00:38:16,895 --> 00:38:19,829
Following our retreat
from Brooklyn Heights,

593
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:22,799
I tasked a native to
reconnoiter enemy encampments

594
00:38:22,801 --> 00:38:27,704
around Long Island and seek out
contacts friendly to our side.

595
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:30,340
His name was Nathan Hale,

596
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:33,877
and he was captured while
he was on a mission for me.

597
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:37,314
He was hanged as a spy.

598
00:38:37,316 --> 00:38:39,683
Fortunately,
his best friend at Yale,

599
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:42,652
a certain Benjamin Tallmadge,

600
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,422
spoke often of his
hometown friends...

601
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:47,090
a whaler named Brewster

602
00:38:47,092 --> 00:38:51,094
and a farmer named Woodhull.

603
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:55,432
I wrote those three names
down on a report,

604
00:38:55,434 --> 00:38:59,336
a report I looked back on
when an unsigned letter

605
00:38:59,338 --> 00:39:03,106
sent by an anonymous
farmer proved correct.

606
00:39:04,642 --> 00:39:09,612
Captain Hale died without
friends to support him.

607
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:13,883
We cannot let that happen
to Mr. Culpepper.

608
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:17,487
Mr. Culpepper?

609
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:21,825
We'll never use
the name Woodhull again.

610
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:35,705
Why was he
wearing your clothes?

611
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:38,408
His aim was to pose as me,

612
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:40,510
escape into the city,
I suppose.

613
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:42,946
Right, and that proves
the general's anxieties.

614
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:46,883
Can't take any more
lone men into New York.

615
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,753
What do you... you mean
I can't continue on?

616
00:39:49,755 --> 00:39:52,455
Not alone.

617
00:39:52,457 --> 00:39:54,057
( Sighs )

618
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:56,526
<i>He tell you his name?</i>

619
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,466
No.

620
00:40:26,957 --> 00:40:31,828
Please don't think that I
condone such barbarism.

621
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:36,966
Just...

622
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:39,669
miss my boy, is all.

623
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:42,872
You have a son?

624
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:46,676
His birthday's comin' round.

625
00:40:46,678 --> 00:40:49,179
Well, then, we must
send him something.

626
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,017
If you think of a gift,
I'll make arrangements

627
00:40:54,019 --> 00:40:56,019
to have it sent
by special courier.

628
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:02,859
Well, there's that smile.

629
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:07,697
That's good. Good, good.

630
00:41:10,034 --> 00:41:12,969
Washington: <i>You are an
invaluable asset to me,</i>

631
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:14,704
and so, General Scott,
I feel it better

632
00:41:14,706 --> 00:41:18,842
to apply your acumen where it
is most needed... on the front.

633
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:21,644
But, sir, a captain can't
run the intelligence branch.

634
00:41:21,646 --> 00:41:24,848
That's why I have
promoted him to major.

635
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:31,554
I wish you the best of
luck, Your Excellency.

636
00:41:40,898 --> 00:41:43,833
He is a fine general.

637
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:48,638
Thank you
for this promotion, sir.

638
00:41:48,640 --> 00:41:51,274
- I pray I do you proud.
- As do I.

639
00:41:51,276 --> 00:41:53,142
