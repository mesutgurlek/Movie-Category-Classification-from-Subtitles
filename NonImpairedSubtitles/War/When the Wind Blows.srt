# DAVID BOWIE: When The Wind Blows

2
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:42,471
# So long, child

3
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,473
# I'm on my way

4
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,159
# And after all is done

5
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,033
# After all is done

6
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,197
# Don't be down

7
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,835
# It's all in the past

8
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,675
# Though you may be afraid

9
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:17,155
# So long, child

10
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,310
# It's awful dark

11
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,953
# And I've never felt the sun

12
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,038
# I dread to think of when

13
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,478
# When the wind blows

14
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,792
# When the wind blows

15
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,271
# When the wind blows

16
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:48,278
# When the wind blows

17
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,273
# Life burns a savage wound

18
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,796
# Angry and wrong

19
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:00,679
# Trusting a twisted word

20
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:04,719
# You'll run, run away

21
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,758
# You'll take him home

22
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,236
# You'll spit and taunt him

23
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,510
# But they won't believe you

24
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,718
# No matter what you say

25
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,071
# So long, child

26
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,513
# It's awful dark

27
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:34,512
# I've never felt the sun

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:42,439
# I dread to think of when the wind blows

29
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,439
# When the wind blows

30
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:50,190
# When the wind blows

31
00:02:52,120 --> 00:03:02,268
# When the wind blows

32
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,076
- Hello, dear.
- Hello, love.

33
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,948
- Did you have a nice morning, dear?
- Oh, all right, thanks.

34
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,996
Rather uneventful.

35
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,152
My life isn't very fast-moving or dynamic.

36
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,708
Well, you are retired, James.

37
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,836
You do seem a bit down, dear.

38
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:50,993
Yes, well, er... I've been reading the papers
in the public library all the morning.

39
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,200
Oh, those things! Full of rubbish.
I never look at them. Except the stars.

40
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:59,829
We must keep abreast of
the international situation, ducksie.

41
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,879
Decisions made by the powers that be
will get to us in the end.

42
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,191
Politics and sport, that's all they're full of.

43
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,750
Could affect us all,
the er... ultimate determent, an' that.

44
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,031
They say there may be a pre-emptive strike,
dear.

45
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,076
Oh, not another strike!

46
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,948
It's wicked! I'd have them all locked up.
Blessed communists!

47
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,190
Well, it all looks pretty umpty.

48
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,669
It's not that sort of strike, duck.

49
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:29,514
- Sausages or beefburgers, dear?
- Sausages, thanks.

50
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,514
It looks as if the balloon
could go up at any moment.

51
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,556
What balloon?

52
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:39,029
- Mashed or chips?
- Chips, thanks.

53
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,076
Oh, I don't know.

54
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,878
The balloon. Er...

55
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,236
Or is it a maroon? I can't remember.

56
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,198
What are you talking about, James?

57
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,154
It looks as if there's going to be a war, dear.

58
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:58,715
Yes, they say it might break out at any time now.

59
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,315
Well, at least you won't be called up, James.
You're far too old.

60
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,279
Well, thank you, my beloved.
I'm still two years younger than you.

61
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,112
Well, if the worst comes to the worst,

62
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:11,397
we'll just have to roll up our sleeves,
tighten our belts,

63
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,711
and put on our tin hats till it's V-E Day again.

64
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,836
It won't be like that this time, love.

65
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:22,278
I think this one is called the "Big Bang Theory."
It's all worked out by brilliant scientists.

66
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,954
Well, we survived the last one,
we can do it again.

67
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,554
It'll take more than a few bombs
to get me down.

68
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:31,997
Yes, yes, we um...
we must... must look on the bright side, ducks.

69
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,550
- Better go over to Radio 4.
- I like Radio 2.

70
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:41,553
Radio 4 is better for the international situation.

71
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,395
Good evening, this is Radio 4, with the news
at six o'clock this Thursday evening.

72
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:50,393
The Prime Minister, speaking a few minutes ago
in the House of Commons,

73
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:54,553
has warned that the international situation
is deteriorating rapidly,

74
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:58,553
and that war could break out at any time
in the next two or three days.

75
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,153
Crumbs!

76
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,708
What's the matter, dear?
Have you burned yourself?

77
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,598
This is it, ducks! This is really it!

78
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,830
Another sausage, dear?

79
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:11,356
I shouldn't worry too much.
It'll probably all blow over.

80
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:17,117
- Three days! Blimey! Three days!
- Language, James! Language!

81
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,751
Crumbs! It's lucky I got more leaflets
from the public library only this morning.

82
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,353
Here we are, see? Er...

83
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,877
"Protect And Survive" and er...
"The Householder's Guide To Survival."

84
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:30,235
Now, this one should be really authoritative.

85
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,072
It's printed by the County Council.

86
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,675
We'd better commence the construction
of a fallout shelter immediately.

87
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,273
We must do the correct thing.

88
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,796
There's treacle tart and custard
or cold bread and butter pudding.

89
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,678
- Er... Treacle tart, please.
- Fallout?

90
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:48,629
- I thought they did that in the army.
- No, dear, it's fall in in the army. Fall in.

91
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,473
Thank goodness
I got all those official leaflets today.

92
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,278
I gave the others to our Ron.

93
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,316
Suppose I hadn't?

94
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,358
We'd have been totally non-prepared.
I mean, just think!

95
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,956
Will you have to dig a hole,
like the old Anderson shelters in the war?

96
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,758
No, dear, that's all old-fashioned.

97
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:09,799
With modern scientific methods, you just use
doors with cushions and books on top.

98
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,792
Where on earth are we going to get doors from,
James?

99
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,348
Well er... you just unscrew them, dear.

100
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,908
You don't mean off our own house!

101
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,678
Well er... yes er... dear.

102
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:25,036
- You're not going to ruin the paintwork, James!
- Oh, don't worry.

103
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,680
I can soon touch it up after the bomb's gone off.

104
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,716
Well, mind you do.

105
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:43,148
Just you be careful, James!

106
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,155
Mind that paint, James!

107
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,836
I hope you know what you're doing.

108
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:14,389
I'll put the screws in a plastic bag.
You'll only go and lose them.

109
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,317
Remember,
they're in the right-hand jug on the dresser.

110
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,591
It's going to be very draughty with no doors on.

111
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:36,279
I expect it's a safety precaution.

112
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,636
It'll let the er... blast go straight through.

113
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,832
It says here...

114
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:49,951
"The inner core or refuge should be placed at
an angle of 60 degrees for maximum strength."

115
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,838
I should place it up against the wall,
if I were you, dear.

116
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,433
Yes, but which are the degrees?

117
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,476
We haven't got any angles.

118
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:00,519
I think we did it at school.
You... You had angles with degrees in.

119
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:04,149
Only I can't remember.
I think I'll ring our Ron. He'll know.

120
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,198
Hello, son. All right? Beryl and the baby?

121
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,910
Good. Er... Iook, I'm building
this governmental inner core or refuge,

122
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,709
and it says, "Place it at an angle of 60 degrees."

123
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,756
Well, what's that mean, exactly?

124
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,429
It's not cobblers, son.

125
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,875
It's in the governmental directive.

126
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,838
You mean you're not constructing
an inner core or refuge?

127
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,592
I gave you the leaflets especially!

128
00:10:43,640 --> 00:10:45,198
But what about baby Jim?

129
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:48,512
Don't start singing!

130
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,070
What do you mean, "We'll all go together
when we go"? It's not funny.

131
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:58,114
No, but it's our duty to carry out
governmental instructions in time of war, son.

132
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,315
Stop laughing, will you? I'm surprised at you.

133
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,153
You're supposed to be a responsible father now.

134
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,273
A protractor? The angle at the bottom?

135
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,636
Er... yes, yes, I see.

136
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,278
OK, son. Thanks.

137
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,713
Now, listen.

138
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,759
Just you start that inner core or refuge.
It's your bounden duty, son.

139
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,318
Cheerio, son.

140
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,356
Now, remember what I said.

141
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,908
I am your father. I do know a bit about war.

142
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,114
Love to Beryl and baby Jim. Ta-ta.

143
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:37,475
Yes er... Ron says I need a protractor.
He says I can get one at Willis's.

144
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,632
He was killing himself laughing,
and he was singing songs!

145
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,075
I can't understand it. I think it's nerves.

146
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,151
He's gone a bit hysterical.

147
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,391
- He can't be drunk at this time of day.
- Our Ron doesn't drink.

148
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:52,189
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, of course not, dear.

149
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,277
Ron is not going to make
an inner core or refuge.

150
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,920
I remonstrated with him, but he was adamant.

151
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,117
He says if London cops it, he'll cop it.
And not to worry, Dad.

152
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,156
It's an irresponsible attitude.

153
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,312
I'm a bit disappointed in him,
adopting that attitude.

154
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,030
He was always a very responsible boy
when he was in the Cubs.

155
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,510
It was going to that art college that spoiled him.

156
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,516
He met some dreadful people there.

157
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,319
Huh! Blessed beatniks!

158
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:26,951
I don't suppose it'll make
a terrific amount of difference, the exact angle.

159
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,879
It'll probably all fall down anyway.
What with the bomb, an' that.

160
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:35,077
If a job's worth doing,
it's worth doing well, James.

161
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:38,277
Yes, dear. But it is only temporary.

162
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,477
After all, it'll all be over in a flash.

163
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,350
Funny to think they were on our side in the war.

164
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,396
- Who, dear?
- The Russkies.

165
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:58,712
- With old Joe Stalin.
- Yes, he was a nice chap.

166
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,756
I liked him.

167
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,796
Like an uncle, he was.

168
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,155
I liked his moustache and his pipe.

169
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,550
Yeah. Roosevelt was nice, too.

170
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,153
There was three of them.

171
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,199
Churchill, Roosevelt and Stalin.

172
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,236
All good blokes.

173
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:22,350
With old Hitler, Goering and Musso,
and all that lot, on the other side.

174
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,076
You somehow knew where you were then.

175
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:31,350
I don't even know who the people are
these days.

176
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,273
I expect it's all done by committees, dear.

177
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:38,273
Yes, and meetings.
I expect they have loads and loads of meetings,

178
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,316
and thus arrive at decisions.

179
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,439
Commuters, too.

180
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,476
They all use commuters these days.

181
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,835
It's got very impersonal.

182
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:51,277
Churchill with his cigar,
old Stalin with his moustache -

183
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,316
you knew where you stood.

184
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,391
Do you think they'll invade?

185
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,869
Oh, no, no. Won't need to.

186
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,916
It'll all be done by missiles.

187
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,956
Long er... range.

188
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,998
Then they'll instil commuters
to take charge of us.

189
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:08,356
It's funny to think there's no shelters this time.

190
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,356
We had an old Anderson in the garden.

191
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,192
I can see it now.

192
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,840
We had nasturtiums growing all over it.

193
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,876
And we painted the front green.

194
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,038
Painted, it looked quite pretty.

195
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,076
Next door grew cabbages on theirs.

196
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,116
Yes. We had a Morrison.

197
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,919
Hm, I used to sleep in it.

198
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,389
I stuck pin-up girls all over the inside.

199
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:34,631
Betty Grable, Anne Shelton, Patricia Roc.

200
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,076
The roof got all smoky,
cos I used to read in bed with a candle.

201
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,511
Yes, it was nice in the war, really.

202
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,718
The shelters, the blackouts, cups of tea...

203
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,519
The ARP, the evacuees.

204
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:52,592
London kids seeing cows for the first time.

205
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,148
Old Churchill on the wireless.

206
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,912
The nine o'clock news.

207
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,198
- Vera Lynn singing away.
Worker's Playtime.

208
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:04,795
Spitfires and Hurricanes in the blue sky
over the cornfields.

209
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,754
The White Cliffs of Dover.

210
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,229
Old Jerry coming over every night.

211
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,554
Those were the days.

212
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:22,949
Don't you dare use my best cushions
from the front room!

213
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,714
I'll get some old ones from upstairs.

214
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,756
I'll put them in plastic bags.

215
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,678
I don't want fingermarks getting all over them.

216
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,273
I shouldn't worry too much, love.

217
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,158
They're bound to get dusty
with all the fallout coming down.

218
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,554
It says here we've got to lay in food supplies
for 14 days.

219
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,393
I'd better put a note out for 28 pints of milk, then.

220
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,359
I'll just pop out and get 14 loaves, dear!
And a protractor.

221
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,916
Anything else you want?

222
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,629
I'll need more plastic bags, dear!

223
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:13,355
There's no bread, ducks! Sold out.

224
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,874
There seems to be some sort of
panic purchasing.

225
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:17,916
It can't be helped, dear.

226
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,956
After all, there is a war on.

227
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,996
Or nearly, anyway.

228
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,918
I hope you haven't left that cape
dripping in the hall, James!

229
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,718
Oh, no, dear.

230
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,351
Mr Willis has sold out of protractors.
I expect everyone wants 60 degrees.

231
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,992
He was terrifically kind, Mr Willis.

232
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,958
He cut me out a bit of card with 60 degrees on it.
Look.

233
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,758
Oh! Nice, dear.

234
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,990
Here's the emergency supplies, ducks.

235
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,117
Two packets of ginger creams,
half a jam sponge,

236
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,192
a tin of pineapple chunks
and a tin of Christmas pud.

237
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:50,350
It'll all be over by Christmas.

238
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:57,954
- You're not decorating now, James!
- We've got to paint the windows white, dear.

239
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:01,032
- Whatever for?
- It's for the radiation, I think.

240
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,716
Like they do in greenhouses,
to keep out the sun. It's the correct thing.

241
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,554
- It won't be that hot, surely!
- Well, I don't know.

242
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,077
They say the one at Hiroshima
was equal to one thousand suns.

243
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,957
So it is quite hot.

244
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:19,999
And besides, the powers that be
are making much better ones now.

245
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:24,596
Science has leaped forward with giant strides.
Oops!

246
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,148
Mind you don't get paint on those curtains,
James.

247
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,038
You should have taken them down first.
You never think.

248
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:33,036
I know that smile of yours, James.

249
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:41,919
"Keep doors closed
to prevent the spread of fire", it says.

250
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:46,111
- But you've taken off half the doors, James.
- Yes, dear.

251
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,236
Won't that make the fire worse, then?

252
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,548
Er...

253
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,471
Well, I er...

254
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,790
Perhaps the blast will blow the fire out.

255
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,510
Well... Hm!

256
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:01,070
The inner core or refuge looks quite cosy,
doesn't it, dear?

257
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,914
I hope those doors aren't marking the wallpaper,
James.

258
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,468
Come in and try it out, dear. Please.

259
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,312
Whoa! Careful! Careful!
You'll have it over!

260
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,755
Budge up, can't you, James?

261
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,833
Couldn't you have made it a bit... wider?

262
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:28,916
It's er... It's constructed in compliance
with the governmental specifications, dear.

263
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,992
Well, they might have made it
wide enough for two people.

264
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,753
Suppose you were married?
- We are married, dear.

265
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,512
Yes, well there you are, then.

266
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:39,996
Oh!

267
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,470
What about if you had children?
Where would they go?

268
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:48,076
Oh, well, you'd just hold them in your arms.
They'd soon fall asleep.

269
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,435
Suppose they were 17 or 18?

270
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,479
Big boys with bristly chins and big boots on.
Skinheads.

271
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:57,632
Well, in that case, you'd er...

272
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,790
just add a few more doors.

273
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,475
There's... no wall space for more doors.

274
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,516
Oh. No.

275
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:09,229
Well, our Ron was never a skinhead, anyway.

276
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,188
What on earth
are you putting the food in there for?

277
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,236
Well, that's where it's got to be.

278
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,232
But why can't it stay in the larder and fridge?

279
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:23,472
Because we must not emerge
for the 14 days of the national emergency.

280
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:27,235
You're not saying we've got to stay in that thing
for two weeks, are you?

281
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,914
Yes, dear. Ours not to reason why.

282
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,956
Now we must do the correct thing.

283
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,996
Well, what about the cooking, then?

284
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,638
How do I get to the cooker?

285
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,598
We'll just have to use the little picnic stove, dear.

286
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,274
- What about the toilet?
- Well er...

287
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,920
Well, we'll have to have a potty, or something.

288
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,560
I can tell you now, James Bloggs,

289
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,030
that I am going to go upstairs
in the proper manner.

290
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:54,591
But you mustn't emerge, dear.
Not for the 14 days of the national emergency.

291
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:57,399
All right, then,
how are you going to empty the chamber pot?

292
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,916
Well, we just have to empty it down the toilet,
I suppose.

293
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,912
- You just said we couldn't go to the toilet.
- Oh. Yes.

294
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,558
Er... Well er... Yeah, well,

295
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,632
Now, we'd better not cross our bridges
till we come to them, eh?

296
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,473
Look on the bright side, eh, ducks?

297
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:16,835
Six, five, zero, zero, six, ten...

298
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:23,550
It says here,
"Two pints of water per person per day."

299
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:26,108
I wonder if we've got enough bottles.

300
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,350
I'll have a look under the stairs, dear.

301
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,473
I've measured the water into the bottles, James.

302
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,028
I've labelled them so we don't get in a muddle.

303
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,076
Oh, good. That's nice, dear.

304
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:49,152
You're very efficient in a national emergency,
dearest.

305
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,196
Get on with you!

306
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:56,038
It says here, "D: Miscellaneous:

307
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:58,839
Salt, tomato ketchup and sauces,

308
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:04,199
pepper, matches, toilet paper, disinfectant,
vitamin tablets,

309
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:07,272
tin opener, knives, forks, spoons."

310
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,999
Funny. No plates.

311
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,590
- What's all that, dear?
- I don't know.

312
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:19,911
It's called "miscellaneous." Pass it in, please.

313
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,876
- Funny.
- What, dear?

314
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:28,669
In the governmental leaflet, it says,
"Remove thin materials from windows."

315
00:21:28,760 --> 00:21:33,390
And in the County Council leaflet, it says,
"Hang white sheets in the windows."

316
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,198
I wonder which is correct.

317
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,748
Oh! It says peanut butter.

318
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,798
We haven't got any. Oh, dear.

319
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:45,351
- Never mind, ducks. I don't like it, nor do you.
- No, but it's on the official list.

320
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,112
Oh, dear.

321
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:49,156
Now, don't worry, love.

322
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,196
I expect we'll survive without it.

323
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,714
It'll probably go runny in the heat, anyway.

324
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,360
You get terrific heat with these bombs,
you know.

325
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,830
Mind you, diet is very important.

326
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,276
You are what you... eat.

327
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:07,716
And the survival of the fittest, an' that. Whoa!

328
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:13,993
That's why so many people...
are jogging and eating lots of All-Bran, I expect.

329
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,437
Only the fittest will survive the outcome
of the nuclear holocaust.

330
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,993
They eat lots of beans, too.

331
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,036
They give you wind, beans do.

332
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,953
You certainly shouldn't eat beans, James.

333
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:27,996
Let's not get personal, ducks.

334
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,913
I'm trying to have a scientific discussion.

335
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:39,230
If there really is going to be a war,
who do you think will win?

336
00:22:39,320 --> 00:22:43,199
Well,
the Americans have tactile nuclear superiority,

337
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:46,636
due to their IBMs and their polar submarines.

338
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,439
But in the event of a pre-emptive strike,

339
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:54,640
innumerate Russian hordes
will sweep across the plains of Central Europe.

340
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,598
Then the US Technical Air Force
will come roaring in

341
00:22:57,680 --> 00:23:03,198
with their Superhawks, B-17 s and B-19s,
bristling with guns! Terrifically armed!

342
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:05,794
"OK, you guys! Let's go!"

343
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:08,440
They'd razor the Russky defences to the ground.

344
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:11,876
Then the marines would parachute in
and round up the population.

345
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:15,794
After that, the big generals would go over -
like er... Ike and Monty.

346
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,032
Then the Russians would capitulate,
and there would be a condition of surrender.

347
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:23,157
Then they'd instil free and fair elections.

348
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,117
One man, one vote.

349
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,236
And women too, nowadays, of course.

350
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:31,074
And thus, the Communist threat
to the Free World would be neutrified,

351
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,436
and democratic principles
would be instilled throughout Russia,

352
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:36,033
whether they liked it or not.

353
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:40,033
That's the world scenario as I see it,
at this moment in time.

354
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:44,352
Monty. Wasn't he in the war?
- Well, of course he was.

355
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,112
He practically won it.

356
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,156
You remember, dear.

357
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,196
Big beret with badges on it.

358
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,919
Tanks. The Desert Rats. El Alamo.

359
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:58,598
But that was ages ago, dear.

360
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:01,877
Yes, well, I expect he's getting on a bit.

361
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,916
Probably been promoted.

362
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,353
More likely dead.

363
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,954
Monty dead? Never!

364
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:12,079
I'll bet he is.
It's about 40 years since the war.

365
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,116
And he had a moustache then!

366
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:17,469
Who's in charge now, then?

367
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:20,028
Oh, one of those commuters, I expect.

368
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,272
It says here,
"Place your National Savings Certificates,

369
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,352
medical cards and birth certificates in a box."

370
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,955
Here's a nice box, dear.
I'll give it a good clean-out.

371
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,996
Oh, thanks.

372
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,310
We'd er... better keep it in a safe place.

373
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:38,716
I wonder what would be a safe place.

374
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,908
Who's in charge of the Russians, dear?

375
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,956
Oh er... it's er...

376
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:57,996
Shavinsky, isn't it?

377
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,911
Or... Molotov.

378
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,271
No. Molotov's just a cocktail, I think.

379
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,079
Krushef. Yes, that's right.

380
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,116
B and K.

381
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,236
Bulgania and Krushef, that's them.

382
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:14,392
And that bloke Marx
has got something to do with it.

383
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:18,274
What are you doing, dear?

384
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:22,592
Blocking out the windows,
in compliance with the governmental directive.

385
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,596
It's the correct thing.

386
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:30,071
Er... yes. Then there's the er...
usual committee, of course,

387
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,630
the Common Term, they call it -
the Soviet Supreme.

388
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,280
They're in charge of the BJ Kee.

389
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,511
That's the Secret Service. SS for short.

390
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,273
Our lot is called EMl-5.

391
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,828
Oh, it's all very complicated, ducks.

392
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:47,673
Well, mind you don't scratch the polish!

393
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:53,111
Is it any good writing him a letter, do you think?

394
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,638
- Who, dear?
- This leader. BJ Whatshisname.

395
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,837
- What are you going to say, dear?
- Oh, I don't know.

396
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,753
Um... Dear Sir,

397
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:07,877
Mr B J thing er...

398
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,714
We, the people of Britain,
are fed up with being bombed.

399
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:17,477
We had enough of it last time, with old Hitler,
so will you just leave us in peace?

400
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:20,279
You live your life and we'll live ours.

401
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:21,998
Hope you are well.

402
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:26,835
Please don't drop any bombs.
Yours sincerely, Mr and Mrs J Bloggs.

403
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:30,792
Very good, dear. Very nice. Yes.

404
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,836
You might be a bit late for the post.

405
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:35,070
You know what the post is like these days.

406
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:37,116
First class might just get there.

407
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,476
But I must do this list.

408
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:47,193
"Dustbin, calendar, books, games, paper,
pencils, shovel, spade, crowbar, axe, hatchet,

409
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:49,874
saw, whistle and/or gong for alarms,

410
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:52,793
suitcases for furniture or evacuation,

411
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,836
string, pliers...

412
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:01,274
...first-aid kits, safety pins, scissors, flints,
aspirins, diarrhoea remedy,

413
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,956
tweezers, calamine lotion, war crisis editions,
lice-flea powder,

414
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,873
rodent poison, insulin, blood-pressure tablets,

415
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,999
rubber gloves, sanitary towels,
mirror, toilet paper, eyewash."

416
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,675
I wonder if it's true about the paper bags.

417
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,910
Or is it a joke?

418
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,036
I never know if it's just a joke or not.

419
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,116
What's that, dear?

420
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,638
Well, they say you should get into a paper bag
just before the bomb goes off.

421
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,472
Whatever for?

422
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:37,472
I suppose it's like the white paint.
It er... deflects the heat a bit.

423
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:41,633
- Sounds silly to me.
- There are some paper bags.

424
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:45,474
We had spuds from the farm in them.
There should be four.

425
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:48,028
They'll be filthy, James.

426
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,277
Are you sure your bag is clean, James?

427
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:55,716
Yes, dear, I... cleaned it thoroughly.

428
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:02,673
You do look silly!

429
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:06,309
I wonder if it's all right to have eyeholes.

430
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:10,119
They say it's the correct thing to wear white.

431
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:14,557
People in Hiroshima with patterned clothes
got burned where the pattern was,

432
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,596
and not so much on the white bits.

433
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,238
Even the buttons showed up.

434
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,276
Yes, but they were Japanese.

435
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,479
Is there a clean white shirt, dear,
ready for the bomb?

436
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:28,235
You're not going to wear that nice new one
I gave you for Christmas!

437
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,038
I don't want that spoiled.

438
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:33,715
You can wear your old clothes for the bomb
and save the best for afterwards.

439
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:37,759
All right, dear.
Well, is there an old white one, without stripes?

440
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,478
I don't want stripes all over me.

441
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,516
I've never heard such nonsense.

442
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,672
We didn't think what colour clothes we had on
in the war.

443
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,196
Lucky to have any clothes at all,
with everything on coupons.

444
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:52,114
We interrupt this programme
for an official government announcement.

445
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:55,272
An enemy missile attack has been launched
against this country.

446
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,794
It is estimated that the missiles

447
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,997
will arrive in approximately three minutes.
Three minutes.

448
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,674
God almighty, ducks!
There's only three minutes to go!

449
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:05,591
Oh, dear. I'll just put the washing on.

450
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:08,353
Come back, you stupid bitch,
and get in the shelter!

451
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:11,671
- How dare you talk to me like that, James!
- Shut up and get in!

452
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,832
There's no need to forget our manners
just because there's a war on.

453
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,399
Shut up! I'm trying to listen!

454
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,232
Take shelter immediately.

455
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:21,756
- I've never heard such language in all my life.
- For God's sake, shut up!

456
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,149
Oh, dear! I've left the oven on!

457
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,196
Get in! Get in! Get in!

458
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:27,838
The cake will be burned!

459
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:30,798
Lie down. Keep away from windows.

460
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,836
Cover your head and eyes.

461
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,753
Do not look at the sky or through windows.

462
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:38,354
Take shelter immediately.

463
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,590
Repeat. % stay indoors.

464
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:43,114
Do not leave your home.

465
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,437
The cake will be be burned!

466
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,556
The cake will be burned!

467
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:21,276
Blimey!

468
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:27,598
Blimey!
- Well I never!

469
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:32,355
Well, I... I suppose... that was it.

470
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,396
I should think so.

471
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,396
Blimey!

472
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,636
You all right, dear?

473
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,676
Yes, thanks, love.

474
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,838
Oh, dear.

475
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,836
I do feel all shaky.

476
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,876
Never mind, ducks.

477
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,428
We're... We're still in one piece, eh?

478
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:56,152
Yes, I think so.

479
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,316
- Wasn't it light?
- Yes.

480
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,356
Terrific.

481
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,989
You get terrific light with these bombs.

482
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:08,878
- The heat!
- I know.

483
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,279
Phew!

484
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,436
It's still hot now.

485
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,991
I wonder how far we are
away from the epicentre.

486
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,799
Or was it the hypocentre?

487
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,633
I can't remember.

488
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,358
What's that, dear?

489
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:30,116
Well, it's the centre of it all.
You know, the er... the bull's-eye, sort of.

490
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,272
Bang in the middle.
Or... Or middle of the bang, rather.

491
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:37,511
I should think we were bang in the middle, dear.

492
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,556
A direct hit.

493
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,830
Oh, just look at all that glass.

494
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:45,878
No, no, it couldn't have been a direct hit, dear.

495
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,112
We would have sustained greater damage
and suffered greater casualties.

496
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,716
Don't talk to me about damage.
Just look at those curtains!

497
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:58,475
Yes, but it would have been much worse
at the epi-hypo thing, dear.

498
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:01,791
I don't see how it could have been much worse.

499
00:34:01,880 --> 00:34:03,836
I'll never get them clean.

500
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,829
I'll give them a good soak tonight.
Blessed Germans!

501
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,876
Russkies, dear.

502
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:15,876
Mm! The shelter stood up well, didn't it?

503
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,033
I constructed it in compliance with
governmental specifications.

504
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:24,511
- I hope the cushions aren't spoiled.
- I think some of them blew off in the blast.

505
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:26,591
I do like nice cushions.

506
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:29,478
Yes, but there's more important things
at the moment, ducks.

507
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,677
And curtains. Cushions and curtains.

508
00:34:33,720 --> 00:34:36,188
I'd better get out and put them in soak now.

509
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:40,319
- Stay in! Er... dear.
- Don't you shout at me, James.

510
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,709
But it's the whole point, dearest.

511
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,030
This is what the shelter's for.

512
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,395
But the blessed bomb has gone off already.

513
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:51,234
Yes, but the fallout is falling out now. See?

514
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,992
No, I don't see.

515
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,916
I can't see any soppy fallout.

516
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,319
I'm getting out.

517
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,312
- Just look at all that mess!
- No. No!

518
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,075
We must stay in. We must do the correct thing.

519
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:06,479
Come on, now.

520
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,155
It's late. Let's get to bed.

521
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:20,229
Whatever is this box of sand for, James?

522
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:23,437
It had better not be for what I think it's for.

523
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:27,274
I've told you
what I think about that subject already.

524
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:33,515
Bomb or no bomb, Hitler or no Hitler,
I'm going to go to the toilet in the proper manner!

525
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,909
No, dear, it's not an earth tray.

526
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,276
The governmental directive says
it's for cleaning plates, an'that.

527
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:41,316
Cleaning plates?

528
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:45,552
Why shouldn't we wash them properly,
and dry them on a nice clean tea towel?

529
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:49,076
We washed up properly all through the war.

530
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:53,438
Well, it's to conserve
emergency water supplies, dear.

531
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,557
What is the world coming to?

532
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,950
You see, dear...
- Tuck my feet in.

533
00:36:01,120 --> 00:36:03,759
My old mother would have a fit if she knew.

534
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,832
- Yes, but...
- Drying plates in an earth tray!

535
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,037
Catch me eating off a plate covered in sand!

536
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:12,076
You'd be the first to complain.

537
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,071
Er... dear, um...

538
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:19,188
A bit of grit in your winkles and you're
spitting and splattering all over the place.

539
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:24,957
Tomorrow, you can put that thing outside
for someone's cat, where it belongs.

540
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,636
Ooh-er!

541
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:37,231
I'm getting fed up stuck in this thing!
I want to get out and tidy up!

542
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:42,114
Just look at all that mess out there!

543
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,475
We must do the correct thing, dear.

544
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:48,519
We must remain in the inner core or refuge.

545
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:51,068
Ours not to reason why.

546
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,914
Our but to um... something or other.

547
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,834
It tells you about this problem
in the County Council directive. I'll show you.

548
00:36:58,920 --> 00:37:01,388
Let's see. Um... Where is it?

549
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,959
Ah, yes. Here we are.

550
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:09,639
"During this period, reduced external stimuli
may produce problems of group behaviour."

551
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,551
Oh, yes, I see, dear.

552
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,269
"Steps to combat this may include the following:

553
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:18,670
At intervals, stimulate group activities."

554
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,196
Don't you dare start stimulating, James!
I'm not in the mood.

555
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,713
No, dear!

556
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,995
It means discussions, an' that.

557
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:30,437
It says, "Discussions, card games, story-telling,
quizzes, etcetera."

558
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,150
Perhaps we'd better try story-telling.

559
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,196
You tell me one.

560
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:39,272
No, I can't. I'd feel funny.

561
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,316
You're not a baby.

562
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:44,710
- Well, pretend I am.
- Don't be silly.

563
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:47,796
- Go on.
- No.

564
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,836
You tell me one.

565
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,150
- I don't know any.
- There you are, then.

566
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,876
What about a quiz?

567
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,590
- I spy with my little eye...
- Oh, not that. It's childish, James.

568
00:38:00,680 --> 00:38:06,118
Or it says here,
"Discuss the changed conditions after an attack,

569
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:10,432
and consider how to overcome
or adapt to them."

570
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,592
Well um... um... let's start on that one, dear.

571
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,955
Who's going to start the ball rolling, eh?

572
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,678
Shall I kick off, eh? Eh?

573
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,716
Right. Here goes.

574
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,994
Um...

575
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:25,995
I think er... we could overcome
the changed conditions after an attack

576
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,640
by er... all pulling our weight,

577
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,676
putting our shoulders to the wheel,

578
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:35,231
so that we all pull together,
now that our backs are against the wall.

579
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,629
And we can show these Jerries...

580
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:40,712
I mean Russkies, just what we think of them.

581
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:44,509
And um... Well, that's all, I think.

582
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,388
Hooray, James!
You ought to be a politician.

583
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:55,671
It says, "Reading aloud to pass the time
is a good idea."

584
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,553
It's a good job I got this book
from the public library.

585
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,359
It's called "Armageddon And You."

586
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:06,876
There's a terrific bit in it
about Western defences.

587
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,916
Now, just listen to this.

588
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,151
"There are three B.M.E. Ws -

589
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:15,198
Ballistic Missile Early Warning systems.

590
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:21,833
One P.R.C. S - Perimeter Acquisition
Radar Attack Characterisation System.

591
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:26,550
Then there's N.O.R.A. D -
North American Air Defense.

592
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:29,996
And J.S. S - Joint Surveillance System.

593
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:34,949
And then seven R.O.C. Cs -
Regional Operation Control Centres.

594
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:40,034
Then there's N.A.D.G. E -
Nato Air Defence Ground Environment,

595
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:45,797
and several A. W.C. S -
Airborne Warning and Control Systems.

596
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:51,113
All this is controlled by the N.C. A -
National Command Authority,

597
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:56,479
by means of the N.M.C. S -
National Military Command System.

598
00:39:56,560 --> 00:40:00,872
And A.M.C. C -
Alternative Military Command Centre.

599
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:05,590
And N.E.A.C. C - National Emergency
Airborne Command Centre.

600
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:13,030
And it all comes under W. W.M.C.C. S -
Worldwide Military Command & Control System.

601
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:21,432
We should be all right
with that lot looking after us, eh, ducks?

602
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,988
Well, it didn't stop them from bombing us, did it?

603
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:27,629
Oh er... well, no er... I suppose not, really.

604
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,837
Still, just think, it might have been worse.

605
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,911
Got to look on the bright side, ducks.

606
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,710
Besides, another thing the powers that be
have created is called M.A.D.

607
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,916
- Mad?
- Yes, M.A.D.

608
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:44,151
M.A.D. Mutal Assured Destruction.

609
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,276
I read about it in the public library.

610
00:40:46,360 --> 00:40:49,591
I think my old dad was in
the Mutual Assured Insurance.

611
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:53,593
- A penny a week it was, in those days.
- This isn't insurance, ducks.

612
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:56,319
I think it covered the cost of the funeral.

613
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,755
Yes, well, I suppose this is similar.

614
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,796
It all comes out of our taxes.

615
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:03,235
He had a lovely funeral, our dad.

616
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,598
You don't pay any taxes now.
You're retired, James.

617
00:41:07,680 --> 00:41:09,636
No, I'm fully paid up.

618
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:11,676
My funeral is fully assured.

619
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,196
Time we went to bed.

620
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:17,236
It's getting dark.

621
00:41:17,320 --> 00:41:20,869
I'll sleep in my clothes.
It's an all-out war situation.

622
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,793
I might be called out in the night
for an emergency.

623
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,713
They may need all able-bodied men
at short notice.

624
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:31,157
They'll soon change their minds
when they see your pot-bellied little body.

625
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,156
Morning, dear.

626
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:43,119
- How do you feel?
- Oh, dear.

627
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,112
- I ache all over.
- So do I.

628
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,196
I've got a terrific headache.

629
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:53,471
Oh... I still feel so tired.

630
00:41:53,560 --> 00:41:56,916
Never mind, ducks. It's probably shock.
The bomb, an' that.

631
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,956
Oh, it's bound to upset us a bit.

632
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:02,794
After all, you don't get a nuclear bomb
every day of the week, do you?

633
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:05,917
Just as well.
Never knew a bomb could give you headaches.

634
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,630
Oh, yes, ducks. I told you these bombs
have a terrific effect on all sorts of things.

635
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:14,679
Right.
A nice cup of tea will perk you up.

636
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:32,794
Funny. They've cut the water off.

637
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:35,792
Still, that's logical. It might be contaminated.

638
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,838
It's a wise precaution
for the protection of the population.

639
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,876
Use the bottles, dear.

640
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,748
Oh, yes, of course.
The emergency reserve supplies.

641
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,839
Most of them seem to have been broken
in the blast, dear.

642
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,876
The contents have been dissipated.

643
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,749
Funny. The electric's off, too.

644
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,717
Still, bound to be.

645
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,756
Conservation of energy resources.

646
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:06,355
A wise governmental precaution
during the period of national emergency.

647
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:09,079
Good job we've got that little picnic stove,
eh, dear?

648
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,991
Are there any aspirins?

649
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:14,834
Mind it doesn't pop, James. I can't...

650
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,876
...bear it when it pops.

651
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:20,476
Mm!

652
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:23,870
Nothing like a cup of tea, hm?

653
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:26,428
Crumbs! I must be dreaming.

654
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,353
The news! We're just in time.

655
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:33,712
No. Nothing. There's nothing.

656
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:35,074
All dead.

657
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:37,958
- What about the telly?
- Yes, of course.

658
00:43:38,040 --> 00:43:40,110
They may have filmed it all.

659
00:43:46,120 --> 00:43:48,076
We may see our bomb on the news.

660
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:53,475
No. All dead.

661
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,790
- No picture?
- No.

662
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,678
- Not even just the voices?
- No! Nothing.

663
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,433
- All dead.
- All dead?

664
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:06,471
- We'll have to wait for the paper.
- There should be some good pictures.

665
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,516
These bombs are quite spectacular.

666
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,353
- He's late already.
- Yes, well, that's logical.

667
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,070
There's bound to be delays and shortages
during the period of national emergency.

668
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:22,030
I'll miss the serial on Woman's Hour.
It was just getting interesting.

669
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,758
Crumbs! I haven't tried the transistor.

670
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:32,392
No. Seems to have packed up.

671
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:34,198
Or probably needs new batteries.

672
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:36,475
Yes, I must pop down to Willis's.

673
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,313
They are a price these days.

674
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:42,437
97p last time. Just fancy!

675
00:44:42,520 --> 00:44:47,275
We ought to get one of these new hi-fis
when your endowment policy comes up.

676
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,830
Oh, yes. Or a stereo.
I've only got two years to go.

677
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:56,676
- I hope Ron and Beryl got back all right.
- Oh, yes, they'll be all right.

678
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:01,072
- Our Ron's a very careful driver.
- I didn't mean the driving so much, dear.

679
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:02,513
More the bomb.

680
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,238
I'll give them a ring.

681
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,469
Hello? Hello? Hello?

682
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:09,998
No, it's not even ringing.

683
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:12,036
Oh, I expect the lines are down.

684
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:15,795
They say there are red-hot winds
of 500 miles an hour.

685
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,440
I expect that would render the lines inoperable.

686
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,108
I'll drop him them a line -
tell them to give us a ring.

687
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,709
- Do you think the post will be going?
- Oh, yes, bound to be.

688
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:29,872
The powers that be
will endeavour to maintain communications.

689
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,077
Remember the Blitz?
The post went on just the same.

690
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:36,835
It's government policy.
It keeps up the morale of the population.

691
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:38,876
I hope Ron is insured.

692
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:41,235
You did pay ours, didn't you, James?

693
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:45,233
Oh, yes, dear. The bomb won't cost us a penny.
We'll be well covered.

694
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:47,276
Mm. Lovely.

695
00:45:48,520 --> 00:45:51,671
We can have some nice new curtains
for the summer.

696
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,076
Crumbs! I wonder if it's all over already.

697
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:06,358
If it is all over, I wish I knew who'd won.

698
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,638
We can't have lost the war, can we, James?
We won the other two.

699
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,676
No, of course not.

700
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,716
Remember old Churchill?

701
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:16,916
"We will never surrender."

702
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:19,833
Yes, but Churchill's not prime minister now,
dear.

703
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,310
Er... no. Well er... of course not.

704
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:28,554
I suppose it won't be the same without er...
with old whatshisname, will it?

705
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,596
Who is it, anyway?

706
00:46:32,040 --> 00:46:36,079
I must check the emergency supplies list.
We never had time to finish it.

707
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,392
It says here, "...a notebook for messages."

708
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,914
Who are you going to write messages to, dear?

709
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,949
Well, you never know. There's always a need
for vital messages in wartime.

710
00:46:48,040 --> 00:46:51,999
Our lives might depend on a vital message
getting through to headquarters.

711
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:53,399
Oh, I see, dear.

712
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:59,112
- And it says, "...a whistle and gong for alarm."
- Oh, what will you do with that, dear?

713
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:04,638
Well, if I saw a Russky coming down the lane,
I'd bang the gong. If we had one.

714
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:08,110
- Wouldn't he shoot you, dear?
- What, just for banging a gong?

715
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,998
He'd be well within his rights to shoot you
if there's a war on.

716
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:13,036
Oh, crumbs! You really think so?

717
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,076
Just for banging a gong?

718
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,357
- I'm glad we haven't got a gong.
- We've got a whistle.

719
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:21,910
- Have we? Where is it?
- I'm not sure.

720
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,434
Hm. Never mind.

721
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,398
Let's leave it. Let's leave it.

722
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:11,356
Oh, I do feel tired.

723
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:14,910
Really exhausted and... all dizzy.

724
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:18,834
Nervous exhaustion
due to unaccustomed lifestyle.

725
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:20,353
That's what that is.

726
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,908
How's your headache, dear?

727
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:27,073
Just the same, thanks.
Aspirins didn't seem to do any good at all.

728
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:32,192
I think I've got a temperature.
I feel all hot and shivery.

729
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,589
You do look pale, dear.

730
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:38,389
- I should have an early night.
- I must clear up.

731
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:43,395
Suppose someone comes and sees the place
in this state? We might have visitors.

732
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:46,870
Yes.
The Emergency Service should arrive today.

733
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:52,353
- I'm surprised they've not come before.
- I expect they've got a lot of people to attend to.

734
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:55,432
Oh, yes. We're only an outlying district.

735
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,751
They'll be heavily engaged
within the stricken area itself.

736
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:03,595
- Will it be like meals on wheels, dear?
- Yes, I should think so.

737
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,752
There'll be mobile canteens and soup kitchens,

738
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,796
teams of doctors and nurses,

739
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,429
helicopters flying in blankets
and medical supplies.

740
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:15,592
It'll all move slowly into action, you bet.

741
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:18,319
They'll all be here in next to no time.

742
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:23,679
The governmental authorities have been aware
of this eventuality for years.

743
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,799
So continency plans
will have been formulated long ago.

744
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,474
We won't have to worry about a thing.

745
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:33,632
The powers that be will get to us in the end.

746
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,029
I hope they come soon, dear.

747
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:38,076
I'm not feeling very well.

748
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,120
I wonder if we'd have been better off
in the cellar.

749
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,838
Oh, no, dear. Too damp.

750
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:45,876
Think of my rheumatism.

751
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,997
- Would you like a bite to eat, dearest?
- No, thanks.

752
00:49:49,080 --> 00:49:51,036
I'm right off food.

753
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,076
So am I.

754
00:49:54,120 --> 00:49:57,829
I must go to the toilet.
And I don't want any arguments.

755
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,911
Blessed dust everywhere.

756
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,389
Oh, crumbs! I forgot!

757
00:50:03,480 --> 00:50:06,278
We're supposed to stay in the inner core
or refuge!

758
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:09,477
Well, it's too late now. We've been out for ages.

759
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,915
Oh, blimey! It was the whole point!

760
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,594
I wonder if there's any radiation about.

761
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,148
Well, I can't see anything.

762
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,432
Hurry up, dear,
and get back in the inner core or refuge!

763
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,476
We'd better have an early night.

764
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:29,553
Well, if you can't see it and can't feel it,

765
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:32,677
it can't be doing you any harm, can it?

766
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:43,550
Better try and er... eat something today, dear.

767
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:46,438
I was sick three times in the night.

768
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:48,476
My headache's even worse.

769
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,790
Let's have a walk round the garden, dear.

770
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:56,398
I've just read it's only 48 hours
in the inner core or refuge, not 14 days.

771
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:00,917
A bit of fresh air is all we need.
I'll get a nice lettuce.

772
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:14,236
Crumbs! Look at the door!

773
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,471
The paint's all gone.
Scorched down to the wood.

774
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:21,155
Never mind, dear.
You said you'd burn it off one day.

775
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,673
The leaves have all gone off the apple tree,
ducks.

776
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:29,036
Oh, yes! What a shame!

777
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:31,793
Still, it'll be lovely in the spring.

778
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,836
It is spring, dear.

779
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,478
Oh! Listen!

780
00:51:38,560 --> 00:51:40,516
A dog!

781
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:44,074
Oh, poor thing!

782
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,956
I expect he's hungry.

783
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,634
The heat has affected the hedge, love.

784
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:53,952
- The beans look a bit shrivelled.
- And I think the lettuce have evaporated.

785
00:51:54,040 --> 00:51:56,190
Well, they do have a high water content.

786
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:02,155
- Can you see any fallout falling out, James?
- No, the sun is trying to get through.

787
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,152
They didn't blow up the sun, thank goodness.

788
00:52:05,240 --> 00:52:09,028
Oh, no, dear. Science is still in its infancy.

789
00:52:09,120 --> 00:52:11,588
What does the fallout look like, dear?

790
00:52:11,680 --> 00:52:14,399
I don't know.
The er... government directive

791
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:17,358
neglects to mention
how the populous could recognise it.

792
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,591
I expect it's a bit like snow, ducks. Only greyer.

793
00:52:20,680 --> 00:52:22,955
The grass looks a funny colour.

794
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,079
Yes, I'll pop down to Mr Sponge's tomorrow
and get some bone meal and dried blood.

795
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:29,833
He might be closed due to the bomb, dear.

796
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:35,916
What, old Sponge?
Miss a day's trade? Not him! He'd rather die!

797
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,754
It's very cloudy. Almost foggy.

798
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:41,990
We need some sun to bring the garden on.

799
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:46,915
- The milkman's not been yet. He's late.
- Oh, well, that's logical.

800
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:49,230
He's bound to be a bit late after the bomb.

801
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,073
Perhaps he's been called up to fight,
or something.

802
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:55,311
Oh, yes. Well er... maybe.

803
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,630
But they'd have got a woman or something.

804
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:02,036
Quiet, isn't it?
- Yes.

805
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,914
I haven't seen no trains. No traffic.

806
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:10,436
I expect they're all having a good lie-in
after the bomb.

807
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:13,476
Terrible smell of burning.

808
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:18,236
Oh, yes.
Well er... bound to be. That's logical.

809
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:23,269
It's like... roast meat.

810
00:53:23,360 --> 00:53:25,316
Yes! Roast dinners.

811
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:28,392
I expect people are having their Sunday dinners
early this week,

812
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,278
due to the unexpected circumstances.

813
00:53:31,360 --> 00:53:35,751
The road's gone all funny.
Seems to have melted a bit.

814
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:40,075
I expect that's why the milkman's late.
He's got stuck somewhere.

815
00:53:40,160 --> 00:53:43,118
I wonder if there's a proper war on.

816
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,156
I wonder who's winning.

817
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:48,676
Never mind. It'll all be in the papers, dear.

818
00:53:48,760 --> 00:53:50,910
Come to think of it, he's late, too.

819
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,150
He missed us altogether yesterday.

820
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:56,357
Well, you can't expect things
to be normal after the bomb.

821
00:53:56,440 --> 00:54:00,558
Difficulties will be experienced throughout
the duration of the emergency period.

822
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:05,919
Normality will only be assumed
after the sensation of hostilities.

823
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,709
Oh, dear.
I think I'm going to be sick again.

824
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,668
There, there, there, ducks.

825
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:20,469
All better now?

826
00:54:24,080 --> 00:54:26,594
I had the most terrible diarrhoea this morning.

827
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,636
Nerves, dear. It's just nerves.

828
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:31,553
I'm the same, and I'm a man.

829
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:38,676
Let's sit in the garden for a bit.

830
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,958
Don't you think we ought to clear up, dear?

831
00:54:43,040 --> 00:54:44,996
Yes, yes, later on.

832
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,353
I feel a bit er... weak and dizzy.

833
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:51,396
We'll make a start soon.

834
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:54,233
Well, suppose Jerry comes this afternoon.

835
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:58,950
No, they'd wait for the fallout to clear.
Too dangerous for a few days.

836
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:00,996
We've got plenty of time.

837
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,753
The situation is well in hand, you bet.

838
00:55:03,840 --> 00:55:06,593
Our boys will be lying in wait for 'em.

839
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,636
I expect they've laid a trap.

840
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,676
Jerry will walk straight into it.

841
00:55:10,760 --> 00:55:14,070
Hello! There's cloud coming up.

842
00:55:14,160 --> 00:55:16,116
Looks like rain.

843
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:22,468
It's raining! I'm going in.

844
00:55:22,560 --> 00:55:24,755
Rain! Yes!

845
00:55:24,840 --> 00:55:27,195
We can save it!

846
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:38,311
Don't you get wet, James. You'll catch a chill.
We don't want you laid up again.

847
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,193
We'll be all right for water now for a while, dear.

848
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,953
Do you think rainwater is all right to drink?

849
00:55:47,040 --> 00:55:49,270
Oh, yes, of course it is.

850
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:52,796
There's nothing purer than rainwater, is there?
Everybody knows that.

851
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,270
Perhaps I'd better boil it.
Best to be on the safe side.

852
00:55:56,360 --> 00:56:00,353
Oh, yes, I suppose so.
We don't want to take unnecessary risks.

853
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:03,079
It may prejudice our chance of survival.

854
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:06,516
What do you mean, James?
We have survived, haven't we?

855
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:12,755
Yes, I know. But after the bombs on Japan,
people died ages later.

856
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,559
I... forget exactly why.

857
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,756
Perhaps they didn't take precautions.

858
00:56:17,840 --> 00:56:21,753
Yes. I expect they neglected to do
the correct thing and...

859
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,796
Oh, and anyway, that was years ago.

860
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:25,836
Science was in its infancy.

861
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,516
We're better equipped to deal with the situation
in the light of modern scientific knowledge.

862
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:36,118
Oh, yes. Nowadays, there's bound to be all sorts
of anditotes and protectives.

863
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:40,751
When the medics get through, they'll probably
just spray us with some anditote,

864
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:45,231
give us a couple of pills, and in no time,
we'll be as right as rain.

865
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:53,035
I'm glad we moved to the country
when you retired, dear.

866
00:56:53,120 --> 00:56:55,429
Yes. Much more peaceful.

867
00:56:56,400 --> 00:56:59,756
If we'd still been in London,
we'd probably have been bombed out by now.

868
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,991
Yes. Unless we'd been evacuated.

869
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:06,436
Oh, that was only children.
And women too, of course.

870
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:09,876
I'd have been requisitioned
for essential war work.

871
00:57:09,960 --> 00:57:11,916
But you're far too old.

872
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,956
You're retired.

873
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:18,238
Yes, but all age groups
are pressed into emergency service

874
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,675
during times of national emergency, dear.

875
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,911
I'd have been an air-raid warden.

876
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:29,557
Or a stretcher bearer for the Red Cross...

877
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:35,715
...and St John's Ambulance Brigade,
or a fireman in the docks.

878
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,476
Jerry up above, fire bombs raining down.

879
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,516
Up the turntable ladder.

880
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,036
Carrying women to safety.

881
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,073
Trust you to think of that, James.

882
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,198
I wish we had neighbours.

883
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,668
I'd like to ask someone what's going on.

884
00:58:00,760 --> 00:58:03,274
Well, I warned you, dear.

885
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:06,432
"This cottage is a bit isolated," I said.

886
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:08,556
"You're not going to like it," I said.

887
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:12,996
I wish we didn't have to stay put.

888
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:16,556
I quite fancy a pint.

889
00:58:16,640 --> 00:58:20,553
I said I'd see old George
down the Half Moon today for a game of darts.

890
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:28,237
I expect he'll be busy with his cows
after the bomb.

891
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:32,552
It might have put them off laying -
milking, I mean.

892
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:36,030
Yes, it may have curdled the milk, or something.

893
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:39,112
These bombs have a terrific effect on things.

894
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,953
He may have switched over to yoghurt.

895
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:47,831
Yes. Lots of people's lives are going to be
considerably affected by the bomb.

896
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:52,236
London Airport will have been
knocked out, I expect.

897
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:55,835
Yes.
Bang goes a lot of people's holidays this year.

898
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,559
The Yanks won't come dropping in.

899
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:01,393
Oh, no.
Not unless to help us against the Russkies.

900
00:59:01,480 --> 00:59:05,029
Remember in the war? "Got any gum, chum?"

901
00:59:05,120 --> 00:59:07,236
We used to stand on the railway embankment,

902
00:59:07,320 --> 00:59:11,074
and the Yanks used to shower us with gum
and chocolate and K Rations.

903
00:59:11,160 --> 00:59:13,116
Terrific, it was.

904
00:59:13,200 --> 00:59:15,156
I wonder if the Russkies chew gum.

905
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,196
"Got any gumski, comrade?"

906
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,353
You won't be able to say that, James.
They're the enemy.

907
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:24,557
Oh, yes. I keep forgetting.

908
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:26,153
Crumbs!

909
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:28,879
We won't have to try and kill them, will we?

910
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,394
Oh, I... I suppose so.

911
00:59:31,480 --> 00:59:34,631
That's what you're supposed to do
to the enemy, isn't it?

912
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:37,837
Crumbs! I hadn't really thought of that.

913
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,754
You mean to say if one of them
comes through that door this afternoon,

914
00:59:41,840 --> 00:59:43,796
I'm supposed to try and kill him?

915
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:47,589
Well, not you, James. After all, you're retired.

916
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,432
Well, what would I kill him with?

917
00:59:50,480 --> 00:59:52,357
A bit of old iron, I suppose.

918
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:55,834
I must mend those socks for you, James.

919
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,798
They'd have Tommy guns. They always do.

920
00:59:58,880 --> 01:00:00,836
He'd mow us down, Hilda!

921
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:04,879
If a German sees you in these socks,
he'll think you're just a peasant.

922
01:00:04,960 --> 01:00:08,111
"Die, you Englishe pig dogs!" he'd say.

923
01:00:08,200 --> 01:00:13,593
"Enemies of der Fatherland! Heil Hitler!"

924
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:19,471
Oh. Oh, no, sorry. No, no, that's the last time.
I keep forgetting, it's the Russkies now.

925
01:00:22,200 --> 01:00:24,839
Just suppose that one did come.

926
01:00:24,920 --> 01:00:26,876
A great big Russian.

927
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:30,270
Big overcoat,
great big boots with snow on them.

928
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,319
Great furry hat,
all covered in belts of ammo and grenades.

929
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,039
Bloomin' great Tommy gun
pointing straight at us!

930
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:39,076
What am I supposed to do?

931
01:00:39,160 --> 01:00:42,914
You could offer him a cup of tea, I suppose.

932
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,558
Argh!

933
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:46,631
We mustn't be collaborators, Hilda.

934
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:48,676
They'd shave our heads.

935
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:52,673
Russians like tea.
A cup of tea wouldn't hurt, surely?

936
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:56,230
I suppose it's better than being mown down
in a hail of bullets.

937
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,512
Crumbs! They might round us up
and take us off to the concentration camps.

938
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,398
Why? We've not done anything.

939
01:01:04,480 --> 01:01:06,789
We're not Jews, or anything.

940
01:01:06,880 --> 01:01:09,997
- Your grandfather was a Jew.
- He was not!

941
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,508
Well, only partly.

942
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,478
They'd send us to Liberia. Down the salt mines.

943
01:01:16,560 --> 01:01:19,597
- Whatever for?
- I don't know.

944
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:21,238
They always do.

945
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:23,276
Perhaps Russians eat a lot of salt.

946
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:26,318
I expect they're quite nice, really.

947
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,233
I saw the Russians dancing on telly once.

948
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:31,878
All in boots.

949
01:01:31,960 --> 01:01:33,916
They seemed nice.

950
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:36,833
Oh, yes. I bet some of them are nice.

951
01:01:38,080 --> 01:01:41,038
There were supposed to be some nice Germans
last time.

952
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:50,276
I think we're running out of water again, dear.
The rainwater's all gone.

953
01:01:52,560 --> 01:01:55,120
Oh, we've still got a pint of milk.

954
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,668
Better save that for teatime.

955
01:01:57,760 --> 01:02:00,228
I can't bear tea without milk.

956
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:04,359
- Posh people have lemon in it.
- I know! Horrible!

957
01:02:04,440 --> 01:02:05,953
Crumbs!

958
01:02:06,040 --> 01:02:09,476
I wonder if it was an American missile
falling a bit short.

959
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:14,190
That happened in the war -
blokes getting shelled by their own guns.

960
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:18,512
Be funny if it was
an American missile that had landed on us.

961
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:20,556
Wouldn't it, dear?

962
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,949
I can't see it's very funny, James.

963
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:26,316
No, well er... Funny peculiar, I mean.

964
01:02:26,400 --> 01:02:28,595
Are they worse than the Russian ones?

965
01:02:28,680 --> 01:02:34,118
Oh, I shouldn't think so, love.
I expect they're all much of a muchness.

966
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,952
They all work on the same principle.

967
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:39,032
It's called er... megadeath, I think.

968
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:42,192
So many millions of people dead per bang.

969
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,430
Any ketchup, dear?

970
01:02:44,520 --> 01:02:47,398
I expect the quantity is similar either way.

971
01:02:47,480 --> 01:02:50,074
Are all the bangs about the same size, then?

972
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:53,038
Oh, no! There's one megaton,

973
01:02:53,120 --> 01:02:55,236
and 10 megaton, an' that.

974
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,518
It's er... just a question of
how big a bang you want to make

975
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,832
and how many... people you want to kill.

976
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:06,797
More baked beans, dear?

977
01:03:07,840 --> 01:03:10,718
No, thanks. I'm a bit off food.

978
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:14,554
Then there's the er... overkill, see?

979
01:03:14,640 --> 01:03:18,713
That's where they kill more people
than they really need to.

980
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,639
Say you want a bang
big enough to kill one million people,

981
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:27,599
and you go and use
a three-million-people bang.

982
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:31,559
It's terrifically wasteful of energy,
in the present economic climate.

983
01:03:31,640 --> 01:03:33,358
I see, dear.

984
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:37,558
Yes, there's one thing
about the present economic situation.

985
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:39,596
- I mean...
- Such a shame we can't wash up.

986
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:44,231
...in order to conserve world energy resources,

987
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,279
the powers that be will only use
the smallest possible bang.

988
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:50,874
Oh, I can't bear it!

989
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:53,349
I expect that's why we're still here.

990
01:03:53,440 --> 01:03:55,510
We're running out of crockery.

991
01:03:55,600 --> 01:03:59,718
We could say we owe our lives
to the world economic procession.

992
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,879
Put the kettle on, will you, ducks?

993
01:04:06,960 --> 01:04:08,916
There's no water, dear.

994
01:04:10,120 --> 01:04:12,076
Oh, no, no. Of course.

995
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,959
Just... Just have to have milk, then.

996
01:04:16,040 --> 01:04:18,429
That pint's gone bad, dear.

997
01:04:18,520 --> 01:04:20,715
The fridge has been off.

998
01:04:20,800 --> 01:04:23,268
Oh, heck! Well er...

999
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:26,157
...a black coffee, then.

1000
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,071
There's still no water, dear.

1001
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:33,953
Well, what...
What are we going to drink, eh? Eh?

1002
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:37,669
What... What...
What are we going to drink, for God's sake?

1003
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,716
Don't shout, dearest.

1004
01:04:41,240 --> 01:04:43,196
I'm sorry, love.

1005
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,238
I'm just... terribly thirsty.

1006
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,959
How about a nice sweet, dear?

1007
01:04:49,040 --> 01:04:51,076
It's a blackcurrant fruit pastille.

1008
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:55,598
There's only one left.

1009
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,279
You have it.
- No, you have it.

1010
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:02,636
We'll er... We'll cut it in half.

1011
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:04,676
That's... That's fair.

1012
01:05:12,040 --> 01:05:15,749
- Help!
- I'm coming! L-l-I'm coming! I'm coming!

1013
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,956
A rat! A rat!

1014
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,838
A rat in the lavatory!

1015
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:27,472
Euww! I saw it! Its tail waving in the pan!

1016
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,516
Never mind, dear. Never mind.

1017
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:33,036
No, no, no. It won't hurt you, dearest.

1018
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:38,638
The pan's all dry and its... head
was round the bend -

1019
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:41,678
just its bottom end sticking out. A tail!

1020
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,716
Oh! A tail!

1021
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:46,997
Horrible! Horrible!

1022
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,229
There, there, dear.

1023
01:05:48,320 --> 01:05:53,997
Don't worry, I... I'll pop down to Willis's
in the morning and I'll get some warfarin.

1024
01:05:54,080 --> 01:05:57,356
At least it shows that the drains aren't blocked.

1025
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,118
Oh, dear!

1026
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,356
I do feel queer!

1027
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:04,919
All shaky.

1028
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:08,675
Well, it's bound to upset you a bit.

1029
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,716
The... The bomb, I mean.

1030
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:17,518
Have you got... lipstick on, dear?

1031
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,556
Lipstick?

1032
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:21,596
What do you mean, James?

1033
01:06:21,680 --> 01:06:24,035
You know I haven't worn lipstick for years.

1034
01:06:24,120 --> 01:06:29,035
- Well er... your lips are all red.
- Oh!

1035
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:31,913
Oh, my!

1036
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:33,956
My gums are bleeding!

1037
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:38,952
I thought there was a... a funny taste.

1038
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:46,196
Well er... Shrinking of gums, causing
ill-fitting dentures. That's... That's what that is.

1039
01:06:46,280 --> 01:06:52,276
Yeah um... Better get to the dentist
when the emergency has rescinded.

1040
01:06:52,360 --> 01:06:55,909
There was blood
when I went to the toilet this morning.

1041
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:57,956
Yes, yes. Me, too.

1042
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:00,918
P-piles, that is. H-hovaloids.

1043
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:05,794
A common complaint in...
in middle-aged people like ourselves.

1044
01:07:05,880 --> 01:07:13,389
I'II... I'll pop down to... to the chemist
when the crisis pales into insignificance,

1045
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:17,359
and I'II... I'll get some of those suppositories.

1046
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:20,553
Oh!

1047
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:22,551
Oh, dear.

1048
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,596
I think I'm going to be sick.

1049
01:07:29,960 --> 01:07:33,032
Now, there, there, ducks.
There, there. There, there.

1050
01:07:33,120 --> 01:07:37,716
Now, now. All better now. Now, please.
Don't upset yourself, love.

1051
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:41,839
Please, please.
Now, don't dry. Don't cry. Don't cry.

1052
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:46,675
I expect it's due to the vibration, you know.
Like that day in the car.

1053
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:50,036
You remember that time
we went to Bournemouth, hm?

1054
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:52,156
And you were sick in the coach.

1055
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:54,595
Don't worry, ducks. Don't worry.

1056
01:07:54,680 --> 01:07:56,830
There can't be anything wrong with you.

1057
01:07:56,920 --> 01:08:01,152
I expect it's... it's just the...
the after-effects of the bomb.

1058
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:32,153
Oh, I... I... I do... fancy a nice cup of tea.

1059
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:37,910
Do you think the cows
have been affected by the bomb, dear?

1060
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,509
No, I... I shouldn't think so.

1061
01:08:41,600 --> 01:08:43,750
They're... They're all out in the country.

1062
01:08:44,800 --> 01:08:47,633
Supplies of milk will be maintained.

1063
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:53,795
It is... essential for the maintenance
of... healthy bones and teeth.

1064
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:57,319
Yes, but we live in the country, dear.

1065
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,870
Yes, yes, yes, I... I know, dear.

1066
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:04,236
Well, the grass is all dead and funny.

1067
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:07,316
Yes um... well er...

1068
01:09:08,680 --> 01:09:10,113
I don't know.

1069
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:16,355
I expect there may be...
a temporary containment of supplies.

1070
01:09:17,280 --> 01:09:21,239
I suppose we'd betterjust sit here
and wait for help to arrive.

1071
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:27,760
Yes. The... The emergency services
will have sprung into action

1072
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:30,752
at the first alarm signal.

1073
01:09:30,840 --> 01:09:33,559
I hope they get here before the enemy.

1074
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:40,870
Oh, I... I hope Beryl and Ron got back all right.

1075
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:43,394
Oh, they'II... they'll be all right.

1076
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:48,519
They'II... They'll have been safely home
long... long before the bomb.

1077
01:09:50,040 --> 01:09:52,349
Our Ron's... a sensible boy.

1078
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:58,952
At the first siren, he'd get the whole family
down to the shelters right away.

1079
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,956
There aren't any shelters, dear.

1080
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,996
Oh, no.

1081
01:10:04,080 --> 01:10:06,310
No, no, I... I forgot.

1082
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,156
But he'II... he'll be all right.

1083
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,198
I gave him the governmental leaflet.

1084
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:14,555
He'II... He'll be all right with that.

1085
01:10:14,640 --> 01:10:21,239
That will afford him the maximum protection
available to the populous.

1086
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,675
He'II... He'll take cover immediately

1087
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:29,039
and... adopt all the prescribed
precautionary measures.

1088
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,350
He... He's no fool, our Ron.

1089
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:35,274
He's not likely to get hot under the collar.

1090
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,590
He... He won't go to pieces.

1091
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:41,719
The whole family will... will stick together.

1092
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:43,756
Oh! Look!

1093
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,388
There's funny spots on my legs.

1094
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:52,108
Er... They're various veins.
That's... That's what that is.

1095
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:55,397
That's... That's a common complaint amongst...

1096
01:10:55,480 --> 01:10:57,994
amongst the middle-aged segment
of the populous.

1097
01:10:58,080 --> 01:11:00,719
Oh, that's... that's...
that's nothing to worry about.

1098
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:03,360
They don't look like veins to me.

1099
01:11:03,440 --> 01:11:05,396
I don't like the look of it.

1100
01:11:05,480 --> 01:11:09,314
Oh... Oh, you are... you are a baby!

1101
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,676
You're a worn... worn...
born worrier, you are, you know.

1102
01:11:12,760 --> 01:11:16,548
Now, you just try and look on the bright side,
eh, ducks? Hm?

1103
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,596
Look! Look!

1104
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:22,195
I've even got funny blotches on my skin, see?

1105
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:24,794
And I... I'm a man.

1106
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:30,159
Yes...
Yes, too much tinned food. That's all that is.

1107
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,196
Yes.

1108
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:35,196
Pilchards never did agree with me.

1109
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:39,755
I must put some skin lotion on those spots.

1110
01:11:39,840 --> 01:11:43,515
Yes. Oh, they'II... they'll soon clear up.

1111
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,672
I'll pop down to the chemist...
chemist in the morning.

1112
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:48,876
I'll get some... get some ointment.

1113
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,916
Yes.

1114
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:55,835
We could do with some lozenges
or pastilles, too.

1115
01:11:58,200 --> 01:12:01,636
- I've still got a terrible throat.
- Yes, so have I.

1116
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,636
I wonder...

1117
01:12:04,720 --> 01:12:08,554
...if they'll be able to sell us some water.

1118
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:11,313
I'm going to have an early night, James.

1119
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:16,669
We could do with a good long rest
after that blessed bomb.

1120
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:21,709
Oh, yes, yes.
It's bound to take it out of you, a thing like that.

1121
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:25,588
Yeah, it's a... it's a shock to the system.

1122
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:28,915
Oh, yes. I expect so.

1123
01:12:29,000 --> 01:12:31,878
Oh!

1124
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,837
Look!

1125
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,233
My hair's coming out!

1126
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:39,039
Don't... Don't worry, dearest.

1127
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:41,156
Don't worry, don't worry.

1128
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:43,549
Women don't go bald. No!

1129
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:46,757
That's... That's a scientific fact.

1130
01:12:48,920 --> 01:12:52,356
Shall we get into those paper bags again?

1131
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:55,034
Well, whatever for, dear?

1132
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:57,429
Well, you never know.

1133
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,560
There might be another one while we're asleep.

1134
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:05,837
Well, I... I suppose it er... wouldn't hurt.

1135
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:11,199
It... It would be a...
a sensible precautionary m-measure

1136
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:14,272
in the... in the... in the circumstances.

1137
01:13:14,360 --> 01:13:20,071
After all, really, this is an all-out war situation,

1138
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:21,752
and er... Well, I mean,

1139
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:27,392
another I... IBM... might... might come over.

1140
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:33,435
Oh, it's stuffy in these bags.

1141
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,436
Yes.

1142
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:39,593
Now you know what it feels like to be a potato.

1143
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,428
I should hate that,
being buried in the ground.

1144
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,080
Oh, yes. Yes, so would I.

1145
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:51,153
- Give me... cremation every time.
Oh, me too.

1146
01:13:54,200 --> 01:14:01,356
We'd better just stay here
and wait for the... emergency services to arrive.

1147
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:05,718
Y-y-yes. Yes, they'II...
they'll take... they'll take good care of us.

1148
01:14:05,800 --> 01:14:08,268
We won't have to worry about... about a thing.

1149
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:12,630
Just... Just leave everything to them.

1150
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:20,070
The governmental authorities...
will know what to do with us.

1151
01:14:20,160 --> 01:14:22,116
The powers that be...

1152
01:14:23,480 --> 01:14:25,789
...will get to us in the end.

1153
01:14:26,920 --> 01:14:32,040
You have got the box with our medical
cards and birth certificates, haven't you?

1154
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:34,076
Yes, dear, yes.

1155
01:14:35,360 --> 01:14:37,316
They're quite safe.

1156
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,150
Shall we pray, dear?

1157
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,156
Pray?
- Yes.

1158
01:14:46,240 --> 01:14:50,916
Oh, crumbs. Er... Who... Who to?

1159
01:14:51,000 --> 01:14:54,151
Well, God, of course.

1160
01:14:54,240 --> 01:14:56,435
Oh... Oh, I see.

1161
01:14:56,520 --> 01:15:03,039
Y-yes. If you think it... it er...
would be... would be the correct thing. Hm?

1162
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,954
It can't do any harm, dear.
- OK.

1163
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:10,157
Er... Here goes.

1164
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:14,831
Er... Dear... sir...

1165
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,876
No, that's wrong.

1166
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:20,839
Well... er...
How... How... How do you start?

1167
01:15:20,920 --> 01:15:23,195
Oh, God...

1168
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:27,398
Our help... in ages past?

1169
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,948
That's it. Keep it up.

1170
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:36,158
Almighty and most merciful Father, er...

1171
01:15:36,240 --> 01:15:38,674
Oh, that's good.

1172
01:15:38,760 --> 01:15:41,479
Dearly beloved,

1173
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:47,271
we are gathered... er... u-u-unto thee...

1174
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:51,431
I shall fear no evil.

1175
01:15:52,520 --> 01:15:56,559
Thy rod... and thy staff... comfort me

1176
01:15:56,640 --> 01:16:00,679
all... the days... the days of my life.

1177
01:16:02,360 --> 01:16:07,229
L-Lay me down... in... in green pastures...

1178
01:16:09,560 --> 01:16:12,233
I... I can't remember any more.

1179
01:16:13,480 --> 01:16:15,436
That was nice.

1180
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:19,114
I liked the bit about the green pasture.

1181
01:16:19,200 --> 01:16:21,156
Oh, oh, yes, yes.

1182
01:16:21,240 --> 01:16:26,075
Into the valley of the shadow of death...

1183
01:16:26,160 --> 01:16:29,914
No more, love.

1184
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:34,714
No more.

1185
