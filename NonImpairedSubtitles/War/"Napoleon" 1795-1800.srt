00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,212
How should I address you?

502
00:36:31,289 --> 00:36:33,348
Monsignor, since you were a bishop?

503
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:34,721
Your Excellency,

504
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:37,556
because the Revolution made
you ambassador to England?

505
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:39,095
Or Minister,

506
00:36:39,163 --> 00:36:42,189
because you are in charge of
France's foreign relations?

507
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:46,134
Most people call me
Talleyrand. Just Talleyrand.

508
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:47,967
Ah, yes.

509
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,631
Like just God?

510
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:52,369
Or Satan.

511
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,809
They like seeing me as the devil,

512
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,870
but I shouldn't think
that would scare you,

513
00:36:56,948 --> 00:37:01,180
because people tell me that
you're not afraid of anything.

514
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,412
Of one thing.

515
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:03,714
Stupidity.

516
00:37:04,288 --> 00:37:06,415
Then you must tremble
every day of your life!

517
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:09,550
I've heard rumblings
about your proposal

518
00:37:09,627 --> 00:37:11,390
for a new constitution.

519
00:37:11,462 --> 00:37:15,091
I must say, I expected something
more revolutionary from you.

520
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,929
I like order.

521
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:20,095
I fought for the Republic.
I'm not a revolutionary.

522
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,072
I share your fondness for order.

523
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,837
But when you speak of a
concentrated government,

524
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:29,573
you don't perchance mean concentrated

525
00:37:29,647 --> 00:37:31,877
in the hands of one man, do you?

526
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:36,413
You ask questions that
sound like answers.

527
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,979
Yes, well, because
it's always difficult

528
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:43,026
to find someone who would
wield that kind of power

529
00:37:43,094 --> 00:37:45,289
who would not become a dictator.

530
00:37:48,866 --> 00:37:49,855
What about you?

531
00:37:51,002 --> 00:37:53,698
Are you interested
in political power?

532
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,171
Me?

533
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:59,698
The glory I won in ltaly is all
I could possibly wish for.

534
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:02,302
Yes, of course there's glory,

535
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,712
but then there's money, too.

536
00:38:04,782 --> 00:38:08,684
In that regard, I was very
well paid by the enemy.

537
00:38:08,753 --> 00:38:09,913
I have other plans.

538
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,818
Oh, do tell me!

539
00:38:11,889 --> 00:38:14,653
I'll be as silent as the grave.

540
00:38:15,126 --> 00:38:16,218
Mathematics.

541
00:38:17,495 --> 00:38:21,056
I became an artilleryman
thanks to mathematics.

542
00:38:21,132 --> 00:38:24,260
My one dream is to return
to my former vocation.

543
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:25,427
To mathematics?

544
00:38:25,503 --> 00:38:27,971
Yes, I hope to be
elected to the institute

545
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:31,668
in the domain of physical
science and mathematics.

546
00:38:31,742 --> 00:38:34,006
Hmm.

547
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,614
Hmm...

548
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,175
And that's all?

549
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,844
For the moment.

550
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:46,679
Hmm.

551
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:48,281
I see.

552
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:50,793
To your modest ambitions.

553
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,288
Salut.

554
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:07,434
What is this place called?

555
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,207
Malmaison, General.
The bad house.

556
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,839
In memory of the barbaric Normans

557
00:39:11,916 --> 00:39:13,645
who raided the place many years ago.

558
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:16,414
Committed infamous crimes here.

559
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,045
I'll open up.

560
00:39:18,122 --> 00:39:20,352
I can turn it into a happy house.

561
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,858
I know it doesn't look like much now,

562
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:26,419
but let me take care of everything.

563
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:29,432
Where did you learn to run a house?

564
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,958
In the West indies, when
you were a little savage?

565
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:36,404
A little savage who always
appreciated beauty.

566
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,465
Expensive things, too.

567
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,875
Over 300,000 francs
for a country house.

568
00:39:41,946 --> 00:39:44,312
You're not paying for it.

569
00:39:44,382 --> 00:39:46,612
Certainly not.

570
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,845
But it's so much
less for your family.

571
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:50,284
Oh please, Joseph.

572
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:52,413
You can't accuse me of
neglecting my family.

573
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:56,017
I've always placed
your welfare above my own.

574
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:58,323
And, my dear
brother-in-law,

575
00:39:58,396 --> 00:40:01,832
the family Bonaparte includes me.

576
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:11,572
I'll wait for you outside.

577
00:40:11,642 --> 00:40:14,202
Probably smells musty in there.

578
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:19,381
I'll wait for you out front.

579
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:30,386
It does smell a bit musty.

580
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:36,699
Soon, it will smell
of joy, of life, of love.

581
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,368
Do you know that when I was a child,

582
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,932
a fortune teller
predicted that one day,

583
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,776
I was going to be
greater than a queen?

584
00:40:49,847 --> 00:40:52,577
Today, I have the
feeling she saw right.

585
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:55,448
This is my palace.

586
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,214
And you will be the king.

587
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,155
Husband is good enough.
I don't like kings.

588
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:07,993
You think we would be mad
to buy it, don't you?

589
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:09,999
I think 300,000 francs
is a lot of money

590
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:11,500
for a general living on his pay.

591
00:41:11,569 --> 00:41:14,265
Yes, but you're worth much
more, because if you wanted...

592
00:41:14,338 --> 00:41:17,273
You don't have to say it.
Talleyrand already did.

593
00:41:17,341 --> 00:41:18,865
The French have had enough

594
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,002
of being governed by
men who are corrupt.

595
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:23,569
But they are not ready to rise up.

596
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:26,275
Perhaps for now, your
interest is to avoid anything

597
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,511
that could tarnish
the glory you won in ltaly.

598
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:31,419
Ideally, I should go
somewhere far away,

599
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,582
pursuing new military triumphs.

600
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,387
You say that as if you already
have a glimmer of an idea.

601
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,588
No, not a glimmer.
A revelation, Josephine.

602
00:41:39,663 --> 00:41:40,595
Egypt.

603
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,427
Egypt? Why Egypt?

604
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:44,525
Because holding Egypt

605
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,571
means cutting off
England's route to lndia,

606
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:51,233
and giving us access to all
the goods from the East.

607
00:41:51,308 --> 00:41:53,173
What's more, our ambassador in Cairo

608
00:41:53,244 --> 00:41:57,203
said that Egypt is a country
of incredible wealth.

609
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,648
When I come back, I'll be
able to buy you Malmaison.

610
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:02,913
That's how you'll make history.

611
00:42:02,987 --> 00:42:06,115
General Bonaparte,
first to have fought a war

612
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,557
so that he could buy
his wife a house.

613
00:43:31,141 --> 00:43:33,336
Gentlemen, the Pyramids.

614
00:43:33,410 --> 00:43:36,971
4,000 years of history
are contemplating us.

615
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:42,008
[ Camel grunts ]

616
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,409
Well, Roustam, the tea!

617
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:21,883
Admire the work of my
cartographers, St. Hilaire.

618
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,223
This is Egypt in the
days of the pharaohs.

619
00:44:24,294 --> 00:44:26,558
Everything is in here,
even the canal.

620
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:28,291
The canal, General?

621
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:30,629
Didn't you know that
the pharaohs built a canal

622
00:44:30,701 --> 00:44:32,259
joining the Nile to the Red Sea?

623
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:33,769
No!

624
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:35,304
Initiated under King Nechao

625
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:38,205
and completed under the Ptolemies,

626
00:44:38,275 --> 00:44:41,540
this prodigious work
stood the test of time

627
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:44,706
for almost 1,000 years,
until it disappeared,

628
00:44:44,782 --> 00:44:45,976
swallowed up by the sands.

629
00:44:46,050 --> 00:44:48,610
Do you believe one could find
vestiges of this canal?

630
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,381
Hmm, without any doubt.

631
00:44:50,454 --> 00:44:53,082
If we started excavating
in this area,

632
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,625
we'd unearth marvels that
would reveal to the world

633
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:59,993
the extraordinary splendour of
the Egyptian civilization.

634
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:02,589
Yet a better idea would
be to dig another canal.

635
00:45:02,666 --> 00:45:07,069
One that would connect the
Red Sea to the Mediterranean.

636
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:10,265
Starting from Suez, for example.
What do you think?

637
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:12,638
The thing is, General,
my interest is in zoology,

638
00:45:12,710 --> 00:45:15,304
so as far as I'm concerned,
these stories about canals...

639
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,505
My dear St. Hilaire.

640
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,140
A scholar must be
curious about everything.

641
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:22,447
L, for instance, had the
Koran translated for me.

642
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:25,647
And this has been
translated from English.

643
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:27,315
I'm under no illusion.

644
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:31,225
In Paris, they will say that
Egypt is a political failure

645
00:45:31,295 --> 00:45:33,024
and financial disaster.

646
00:45:33,097 --> 00:45:35,588
I will need you and your colleagues

647
00:45:35,666 --> 00:45:37,293
to silence my detractors.

648
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,995
Let everybody know that our saga

649
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:43,164
will have countless effects
upon civilization.

650
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,105
This will be our way of thanking you

651
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:46,972
for this incredible journey, General.

652
00:45:54,351 --> 00:45:57,047
The English are calling
on my men to desert

653
00:45:57,121 --> 00:46:00,181
by flooding our lines
with this drivel.

654
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:02,952
It will have no effect on them.

655
00:46:03,026 --> 00:46:04,550
I'm not so sure.

656
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:06,687
The men have had enough.

657
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:08,425
Most of the time,

658
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:10,433
we have to force them to obey.

659
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,696
Have the officers
discipline them again.

660
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,135
That's why they are here.

661
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:17,571

no right to allow them,

The plan is audacious,
Napoleon. But it can work.

921
01:03:20,863 --> 01:03:23,525
We've based it on two factors.

922
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:27,262
First, the people hate
the current government.

923

And two, they see you as a hero.

You want to overthrow the Directoire?

925
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:33,465
It wouldn't take much of a push.

And in its place, Napoleon Bonaparte?

927

You've always kept your
distance from politics.

France is so weak now.

She won't be able to stand
another revolution.

The royalists
would make the most of it!

933

Who said anything about a revolution?

934
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:58,992
Everything will be done
perfectly legally!

935
01:03:59,068 --> 01:04:01,798
We just have to persuade the deputies

936
01:04:01,871 --> 01:04:06,274
to elect a new government,
and get rid of the Directory,

937
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,310
and elect in its place
a new government,

938

composed of three irreproachable men.

939
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:12,776
Sieyes, Roger-Ducos, and you.

940
01:04:16,986 --> 01:04:20,217
It's possible.

941
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:24,157
If you were to assemble all
the deputies for a special session,

942
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:25,353
somewhere isolated

943
01:04:25,428 --> 01:04:28,955
where the army could
bring pressure to bear,

944
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,431
if needed, without triggering
a riot in the city.

945
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,592
That's perfect.

946
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:35,262
And with Murat
at the head of the troops,

947
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:36,327
we can't fail.

948
01:04:36,405 --> 01:04:38,635
I suggest
Chateau de St. Cloud.

949
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:41,176
It's far enough from Paris,
and easy to control.

950
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:42,643
I agree.

951
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:45,442
Can we assume that you
approve of our little project?

952
01:04:45,514 --> 01:04:47,141
Your little project,

953
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,548
as you call it so discreetly,
my dear Joseph,

954
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,587
is nothing less than a coup d'etat.

955
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:55,715
If it fails, we will end
up in prison, at best,

956
01:04:55,791 --> 01:04:57,759
and more likely under the blade.

957
01:04:57,827 --> 01:05:00,387
Are you still so sure
that Murat will follow us?

958
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:02,988
I can speak for him
as I do for myself.

959
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,692
He'll only want to know in what name

960
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,997
he's risking his liberty and life.

961
01:05:07,069 --> 01:05:09,094
In what name?

962
01:05:09,171 --> 01:05:11,196
In the name of reality.

963
01:05:11,274 --> 01:05:13,401
Louis XVIII is ready to enter Paris.

964
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:15,876
If we delay, the Republic
will be lost,

965
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:18,743
and with it all the benefits
of the Revolution.

966
01:05:18,814 --> 01:05:22,477
That's reason enough
to risk everything.

967
01:05:48,511 --> 01:05:51,105
I'm counting on you
to control the gates of Paris

968
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:53,512
on the 18th of Brumaire.

969
01:05:53,582 --> 01:05:55,413
No government official can be allowed

970
01:05:55,484 --> 01:05:57,645
to enter or leave the city.

971
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,314
I also want your censor
to check everything

972
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:02,118
that's announced in the press.

973
01:06:02,191 --> 01:06:05,319
The newspapers will only
be allowed to print

974
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:08,022
what my associates and I decide on.

975
01:06:09,899 --> 01:06:13,096
In other words, you're
asking me to support a plot?

976
01:06:13,169 --> 01:06:15,603
I don't consider ridding the country

977
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:17,901
of a bunch of rogues and
swindlers to be a plot.

978
01:06:17,974 --> 01:06:20,568
Even though I may not always approve

979
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:25,740
of the government's policies,
I'm a member of it.

980
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:27,612
You'll be a member of the next one.

981
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:29,116
You'll be my minister of police.

982
01:06:29,185 --> 01:06:30,447
That's generous of you,

983
01:06:30,519 --> 01:06:32,749
but I am already minister of police.

984
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:35,586
So if you have no other arguments...

985
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,024
I do have one, yes.

986
01:06:38,094 --> 01:06:40,255
I'm sure the royalists
haven't forgotten

987
01:06:40,329 --> 01:06:42,797
how you slaughtered hundreds
of their followers

01:15:46,975 --> 01:15:48,101
in front of the fire.

1151
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:50,440
I think in another life,
he must have been a cat.

1152
01:15:50,512 --> 01:15:52,605
A cat, huh? I'd say a cobra.

1153
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:55,479
Shh! Bonaparte, he supports
you without hesitation.

1154
01:15:55,551 --> 01:15:58,952
You mean, I support him, which
is only normal for a cripple.

1155
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:00,818
Shh!

1156
01:16:07,195 --> 01:16:09,891
No, don't say anything, Talleyrand.

1157
01:16:09,965 --> 01:16:12,126
I've already been showered

1158
01:16:12,200 --> 01:16:14,430
with all the compliments
you can imagine.

1159
01:16:14,503 --> 01:16:16,994
But I have no illusion that
this fine suit of clothes

1160
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:20,769
won't be enough to
reassure our neighbours

1161
01:16:20,842 --> 01:16:24,710
that France has finally put
the revolution behind her.

1162
01:16:24,780 --> 01:16:27,806
True, the European courts
fear the strength of our army

1163
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:30,147
less than the strength of our ideas.

1164
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:31,845
Therefore, we must demonstrate

1165
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:34,718
that we are civilized
people once more.

1166
01:16:34,790 --> 01:16:37,224
An aristocrat, a real aristocrat

1167
01:16:37,292 --> 01:16:38,884
who knows how to behave insolently,

1168
01:16:38,961 --> 01:16:41,862
yet with princely grace,
would give us prestige.

1169
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:46,663
You were the Minister of Foreign
Affairs of the Directoire.

1170
01:16:46,735 --> 01:16:48,566
The First Consul reappoints you

1171
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:50,036
to that office.

1172
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:52,232
I suppose I should feel flattered

1173
01:16:52,307 --> 01:16:54,639
that you consider me
to have princely grace.

1174
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:56,575
But I would display more of it

1175
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:59,375
if your choice was based
on my skill at negotiating.

1176
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:01,348
Negotiating what?

1177
01:17:01,416 --> 01:17:04,817
Austria recaptured ltaly from
France while I was in Egypt.

1178
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:07,855
And we either accept
the loss of ltaly, or...

1179
01:17:07,923 --> 01:17:10,391
Or wage war on Austria.

1180
01:17:11,026 --> 01:17:13,187
I usually believe
the worst can be avoided.

1181
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:14,853
War is not the worst, Talleyrand.

1182
01:17:14,930 --> 01:17:17,228
The worst would be allowing them

1183
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,767
to treat France like the
village idiot of Europe.

1184
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:22,133
The one who is slapped
and then says thank you.

1185
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:25,469
What do you know about war?
You've never been to war.

1186
01:17:25,540 --> 01:17:27,132
Alas.

1187
01:17:27,209 --> 01:17:30,007
A soldier who can neither attack

1188
01:17:30,078 --> 01:17:32,740
nor, more especially,
flee in sufficient haste,

1189
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:34,645
is a liability.

1190
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:37,446
Otherwise, I might have
pursued a military career.

1191
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:39,544
You? A general?

1192
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:40,986
General Talleyrand?

1193
01:17:42,224 --> 01:17:43,748
Perhaps you envy my glory.

1194
01:17:43,825 --> 01:17:45,656
You can share it,
it you're loyal to me.

1195
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:49,625
Sire, I wish only to serve you.

1196
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:54,663
You bow as you say that,

1197
01:17:54,736 --> 01:17:57,864
so one can't see whether
your eyes support your words.

1198
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:02,000
Man was given speech
to disguise his thoughts,

1199
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:04,568
and words to disguise his eyes.

1200
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:08,412
Don't trust anything, or anyone.

1201
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:38,403
[Officer]: Present arms!

1202
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:41,508
Monsieur
Pierre-Louis Roederer,

1203
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,380
who I have appointed
Councilor of State

1204
01:18:43,452 --> 01:18:46,182
because he served me well,
and will continue to do so.

1205
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,946
I'm delighted to meet you, sir.

1206
01:18:48,023 --> 01:18:51,186
Welcome to the Tuileries, Madame.

1207
01:18:53,762 --> 01:18:56,094
I hope you will like it here.

1208
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:01,496
Are you coming?

1209
01:19:15,350 --> 01:19:18,080
Here we are in the waiting room.

1210
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:20,246
Please...

1211
01:19:22,557 --> 01:19:25,583
And here are Queen Marie
Antoinette's apartments.

1212
01:19:37,172 --> 01:19:39,367
Not very cheerful, I'm afraid.

1213
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:41,136
The price of power.

1214
01:19:41,209 --> 01:19:43,074
I hope they've changed the sheets.

1215
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:44,806
Don't be silly.

1216
01:19:46,148 --> 01:19:48,173
It's morbid.

1217
01:19:48,250 --> 01:19:50,081
If you must live in the Tuileries,

1218
01:19:50,152 --> 01:19:53,315
can't we take a different apartment?

1219
01:19:53,388 --> 01:19:54,753
This one feels haunted.

1220
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:56,757
Superstitious nonsense.

1221
01:19:56,825 --> 01:19:59,259
Once it's refurnished
to your taste, you'll be happy.

1222
01:19:59,327 --> 01:20:01,659
And whenever you need a change,
we can go to Malmaison.

1223
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:03,459
I need a change right now.
Let's go.

1224
01:20:03,532 --> 01:20:04,794
No, don't be childish.

1225
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:06,458
Maybe tomorrow.

1226
01:20:07,769 --> 01:20:10,203
When we got married,
I could ask you anything.

1227
01:20:10,272 --> 01:20:12,638
And you always said yes right away.

1228
01:20:12,707 --> 01:20:14,538
Now it's always "maybe tomorrow".

1229
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:18,469
You love me less, Bonaparte.

1230
01:20:23,418 --> 01:20:24,908
I am sorry.

1231
01:20:24,986 --> 01:20:27,921
Maybe we should have thought
of redecorating the rooms before...

1232
01:20:27,989 --> 01:20:29,081
She'll get used to it.

1233
01:20:29,157 --> 01:20:30,784
It would be a sorry state of affairs

1234
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:32,759
if my wife were
the one person in France

1235
01:20:32,828 --> 01:20:34,193
to contest my authority.

1236
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:36,162
Show me where my study is.

1237
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:38,062
Please.

1238
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:40,294
Have an article published
in the newspapers

1239
01:20:40,368 --> 01:20:42,063
saying I'm against powdered wigs

1240
01:20:42,137 --> 01:20:44,935
coming back into fashion for men.

1241
01:20:45,006 --> 01:20:47,497
It's ludicrous!

1242
01:20:47,576 --> 01:20:49,806
Have they finished an exact account

1243
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:53,314
of what's left in the state coffers?

1244
01:20:53,381 --> 01:20:56,373
167,000 francs.

1245
01:20:58,820 --> 01:21:01,448
Scandalous.

1246
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:03,388
I'm sure there's 10 times that amount

1247
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:07,326
in the pockets of each former
member of the Directoire.

1248
01:21:07,395 --> 01:21:10,023
This means France is bankrupt.

1249
01:21:10,098 --> 01:21:14,262
We will need to bring in several
million francs this year.

1250
01:21:14,336 --> 01:21:17,032
The Minister of Police!

1251
01:21:18,373 --> 01:21:19,635
Ah. Fouche.

1252
01:21:20,642 --> 01:21:22,303
Come in, Fouche.

1253
01:21:23,945 --> 01:21:28,405
You're not an ordinary minister
anymore. You're my minister.

1254
01:21:30,018 --> 01:21:33,715
So I expect from you
a flawless efficiency.

1255
01:21:33,788 --> 01:21:37,952
And yet I hear you
dislike ruthless measures.

1256
01:21:38,326 --> 01:21:40,988
How do you define ruthless?

1257
01:21:41,062 --> 01:21:42,586
Arresting, imprisoning.

1258
01:21:42,664 --> 01:21:43,858
When we imprison a man,

1259
01:21:43,932 --> 01:21:46,298
it's usually because
he has broken the law.

1260
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:48,461
In order words, when it's too late.

1261
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:51,699
Personally, I'd rather prevent
him from committing a crime.

1262
01:21:51,773 --> 01:21:54,333
Yet you have to know to prevent it.

1263
01:21:54,409 --> 01:21:58,743
Yes. Know everything
about everyone.

1264
01:21:58,813 --> 01:22:02,112
Oh, so you claim to keep
watch on the whole of France?

1265
01:22:02,183 --> 01:22:04,743
I have my informers.

1266
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:07,549
This system has saved
your life many times over.

1267
01:22:07,622 --> 01:22:09,419
And you didn't inform me?

1268
01:22:09,491 --> 01:22:12,858
The bombs were all found in time.

1269
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:16,227
Bombs. Who planted them?

1270
01:22:16,298 --> 01:22:19,597
The royalists, with England
acting as their banker.

1271
01:22:19,668 --> 01:22:24,605
A bomb is more expensive than
a vial of poison, or a dagger.

1272
01:22:26,975 --> 01:22:28,806
So...

1273
01:22:28,877 --> 01:22:31,573
this is what politics is like.

1274
01:22:31,646 --> 01:22:33,705
No, this is what hatred is like,

1275
01:22:33,782 --> 01:22:36,012
Monsieur le Premier Consul.

1276
01:22:37,452 --> 01:22:39,113
Hatred.

1277
01:22:49,364 --> 01:22:51,389
You're not dressed!

1278
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:53,866
But the carriage
is awaiting in the courtyard.

1279
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:55,960
Have you forgotten we're
going to the opera?

1280
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:58,164
No, but Bonaparte is working.

1281
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:00,537
And when he locks himself
up in his office,

1282
01:23:00,608 --> 01:23:03,042
God knows when he'll reappear.

1283
01:23:03,111 --> 01:23:05,602
No, but you go ahead!
Go ahead to the opera.

1284
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:08,012
Ask Murat and Caroline
to chaperone you.

1285
01:23:08,083 --> 01:23:11,644
Thank you very much, but
I don't need any chaperoning.

1286
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:14,245
But you're only 17, Hortense.

1287
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:17,155
And at your age, a girl can
easily have her head turned.

1288
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:19,625
And men you know...

1289
01:23:19,694 --> 01:23:21,252
And what if my head is turned?

1290
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:24,628
Bonaparte has other plans for you.

1291
01:23:24,699 --> 01:23:27,862
Nothing is settled, of course, but...

1292
01:23:27,936 --> 01:23:31,872
he's wishing for you
to marry his brother, Louis.

1293
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,373
Louis?

1294
01:23:34,542 --> 01:23:38,137
But have you ever looked at him?

1295
01:23:38,213 --> 01:23:39,737
Or spoken with him?

1296
01:23:39,814 --> 01:23:41,577
He's ugly and miserable!

1297
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:43,742
But my child,

1298
01:23:43,818 --> 01:23:46,013
if the First Consul is asking
for you to marry him...

1299
01:23:46,087 --> 01:23:48,920
The First Consul should look
after the affairs of state

1300
01:23:48,990 --> 01:23:50,287
and leave me alone!

1301
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:53,824
And what's more,
he should look after you.

1302
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:57,922
But he loves me, as much as
he loved me the first day we've met.

1303
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:02,368
Then let's hope that what
everyone is waiting for

1304
01:24:02,437 --> 01:24:03,631
will finally happen.

1305
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,536
And what do you mean by that?

1306
01:24:05,607 --> 01:24:07,438
You know very well.

1307
01:24:07,509 --> 01:24:09,875
People are surprised

predicted as a defeat

Paris is dying of thirst.
