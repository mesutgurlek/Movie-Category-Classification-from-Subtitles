1
00:00:15,115 --> 00:00:19,245
Well, uh,
here's lookin'at you...

2
00:00:19,319 --> 00:00:21,753
- pilgrim.
- Laughing.

3
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:25,086
- So,Jack, this is good.
- What are we gonna do tonight?

4
00:00:25,158 --> 00:00:27,353
You know what?
I was gonna ask you.

5
00:00:27,427 --> 00:00:30,692
- Can Gabriella hook me up with
her, uh- - Oh,you know what?

6
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,959
She's got this new friend
she met the other day at the mall.

7
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,967
- Her name is Rosa.
- Yeah?

8
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,766
- She's Spanish. Espanol.
- Si, si, senor.

9
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,806
But the only thing-
Wow, watch out for that.

10
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:44,776
The thing is, Rosa,
she's kind of dumb.

11
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:47,404
Watch out for the water.!
Water, water.! Aah.!

12
00:00:49,315 --> 00:00:52,113
Whoa.!

13
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:56,246
- She's kinda like, she's kinda like... large.
- That's good for me.

14
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:58,256
Bones, look out.!
You're gonna get killed.!

15
00:00:58,324 --> 00:01:00,986
If it's too hot for ya, son,
get outta the kitchen.

16
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,929
This is war.
No room for the faint ofheart.

17
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,989
When you're in the heat ofbattle,
and you lean down...

18
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,058
and put your hand
in a puddle of goo...

19
00:01:09,135 --> 00:01:11,763
that two seconds before
was your friend's face...

20
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:15,272
that is war, son,;
now that is war.!

21
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:19,368
This right here?
This is just a game.

22
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,572
- Look at this road right here. See that?
- Hop it.

23
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:23,775
Boom.! Watch this.
Doin'great.

24
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,512
- That's nice.
- See how I just blow those guys?

25
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,884
- Look. Now there's the thing.
- Look up! Look up!

26
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:32,322
No, on the-
Ooh.

27
00:01:32,392 --> 00:01:34,326
Game over.
You are dead.

28
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:36,328
Shouldn't we get back to work?

29
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,387
I'm working. Look, I'm testing out
new products.

30
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,696
What are you so paranoid for, anyways?
Pretty soon we're gonna have our own store.

31
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,362
Quinn's gonna fire your ass
from this place.

32
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,235
Do you think I'm scared
of that- What is he?

33
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,808
He looks like Lurch.
Hey, I'm Quinn.

34
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:51,843
- Are you afraid of him?
- No.

35
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:55,711
Bones?
Quinn's lookin' for you.

36
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:58,012
I told him you were
playin' video games.

37
00:01:58,084 --> 00:02:00,052
Hold this, okay? I gotta do somethin'.

38
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,351
Oh, yeah, you're not afraid, huh?

39
00:02:29,082 --> 00:02:32,882
This is all for you.
See all the money I'm savin'?

40
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:35,079
Wow, Quinn, look at you!
You're lookin' fantastic!

41
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:38,420
Is that a new suit?
It's got to be Armani.

42
00:02:39,592 --> 00:02:41,526
Oh, it's J.C. Penney.

43
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:44,859
At least you wear it well.
Is that Brut I smell?

44
00:02:44,931 --> 00:02:47,559
What did we say about
leaving the sales floor?

45
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:49,568
You told me not to,
and I won't.

46
00:02:49,636 --> 00:02:52,764
If this place catches fire,
I'm sellin' tape decks to the firemen.

47
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,102
You're not selling anything
to anybody!

48
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,403
- That's why we're letting you go.
- Where?

49
00:02:57,477 --> 00:03:00,173
- Home.
- No, no, Quinn. Hey, you can't fire me.

50
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:03,340
C'mon! I'm a Crazy Boy!
I'm a dedicated Crazy Boy.

51
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:07,477
- Bones, let's not drag this out.
- Quinn, look. C'mon. Please.

52
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:11,149
My rent's due. My mom needs
another tummy tuck. Please.

53
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,625
- No, Bones. No, not this time.
- Please, there's a lot of personal-

54
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:18,460
Please don't let me go,
Quinn. I could be crazier.

55
00:03:18,531 --> 00:03:20,055
Let go of my leg!

56
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:23,864
I could be totally insane!

57
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,566
- Bones, let go of my leg.
- Bones, you have a customer waiting.

58
00:03:28,675 --> 00:03:31,075
You'll have to excuse me, Mr. Quinn.
I have a customer...

59
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,612
a customer who evidently
asked for me by name.

60
00:03:38,685 --> 00:03:41,051
- Hi.! May I help you, miss?
- Yes.

61
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,022
You sold me this Watchman last week,
and I have to return it.

62
00:03:45,091 --> 00:03:48,492
I knew you'd be returning it.
It's too small. It'll ruin your eyesight.

63
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,291
Besides, I could tell
the one you really want is this one.

64
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:53,559
This is our
top-of-the-line.

65
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:57,797
Our very best 35"
projection stereo color monitor...

66
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,065
with advanced
super-digital P-in-P.

67
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,505
I'm sorry.
That's way out of my price range.

68
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,805
Not with our $200 rebate,
no money down...

69
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,607
ten-month deferred,
64-month layaway plan.

70
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:10,843
You ask yourself,
"How could it be?" Right?

71
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:14,284
Because-a we're-a
Crazy Boys!

72
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:18,916
- Sorry, they make us do that.
- That's a very nice offer, but-

73
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:22,985
- Plus this screen promotes good eyesight.
- Really?

74
00:04:23,062 --> 00:04:26,862
Four out of five optometrists
recommend it.

75
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,595
Okay,
I'll take it.

76
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:31,432
Okay, fantastic.

77
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,973
I'm gonna take this to the cashier,
and I'm gonna arrange everything.

78
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,599
Thank you very much.

79
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:39,678
- ... needed for a carryout.
- Huh?

80
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:46,010
Hmm? C'mon. Am I not
still a Crazy Boy?

81
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:49,917
That is Brut I smell,
you pervert.

82
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,923
Heh-heh-heh.

83
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,696
Bones!
C'mon.

84
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,289
Shh. Coming.

85
00:05:00,366 --> 00:05:02,300
Friends of both parties...

86
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:05,360
have been making frequent
appearances at the courthouse all day.

87
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,872
Gabriella,
you were outstanding.

88
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:11,933
Yeah, right. This is the last time
I save your butt, okay?

89
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:14,172
- I work too, you know.
- I know. It was an emergency.

90
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:16,875
- The guy was about to fire me.
- It's always an emergency.

91
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:19,747
- They better take that TVback.
- They're gonna take it back.

92
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:25,189
Now, how 'bout giving
your little Italian sausage man...

93
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,351
a little kissy-pooh?

94
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:30,419
The U.S. has
issued strong warnings-

95
00:05:32,198 --> 00:05:34,359
You are so irresponsible!

96
00:05:34,434 --> 00:05:36,925
Can't you be serious
for one minute?

97
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:40,699
Okay, I'll be serious.
Let's get naked.

98
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,469
Not now!
Not here!

99
00:05:43,576 --> 00:05:45,441
- Why? Don't you love me anymore?
- Yes.

100
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,741
Of course I love you.

101
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,749
But look,your boss
is gonna catch us.

102
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:55,117
I don't care about that perverted fatso
in a J.C. Penney suit.

103
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,986
Bones!

104
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,548
Jack, turn it off!. Turn it off!.

105
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,060
Turn it off!.

106
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:13,603
Well, uh-

107
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,609
I can't believe
he actually fired us.

108
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,376
Bones, we blew up
22 TV sets.

109
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,509
- Yeah, but don't those things come with warranties?
- I'm sorry, man.

110
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:30,317
- I didn't realize Quinn could see you in all of those TVs.
- No problemo, my friend.

111
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:33,325
I was sick of gettin' down on my knees
for that guy, anyway...

112
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:36,521
Whoa!
Bones, I had no idea.

113
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:39,588
- begging for my job.
- I know.

114
00:06:39,665 --> 00:06:42,133
You know what,Jack? This is amazing.
You know what this does?

115
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,726
- Yeah.
- This brings us one step closer...

116
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,828
to the... store.

117
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:51,273
No, no, no. What this does is bring us
one step closer to living in the Dumpster.

118
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:55,212
How are we gonna get rent for the store
if we don't have rent for our apartment?

119
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,873
Excuse me.
Can we play through?

120
00:06:56,949 --> 00:06:59,247
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

121
00:06:59,318 --> 00:07:01,309
Sorry, we were
just discussing-

122
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:07,155
- Hey! - Oh,
my god! - Army!

123
00:07:07,226 --> 00:07:11,060
Navy.! Air Force.!
Marines.!

124
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:12,563
No.

125
00:07:12,632 --> 00:07:15,601
Did you order a code red?
Answer me!

126
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,602
Did you order
a code red, man?

127
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:20,672
You want the truth?
You can't handle the truth.

128
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,298
Yea.!

129
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:24,968
He's goofin' off.
C'mon, Bones.

130
00:07:25,077 --> 00:07:28,342
- Wow, that was my Nicholson impression.
- Good.

131
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:31,110
I do it sometimes
when I play golf.

132
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:35,143
- Bones, c'mon, man!
- I couldn't help myself. I'm sorry.

133
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:38,156
When you join the Army, is it true
you have to give your whole life away?

134
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,954
- Nah. It's nothin' like that with us.
- We're in the Reserves.

135
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:43,518
What's that?

136
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,530
Let's just get
this straight here.

137
00:07:45,598 --> 00:07:49,534
After our basic training, we owe you
two weeks a year and one weekend a month...

138
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,570
for which we get paid.

139
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:57,439
And on top of it, you're gonna throw in
$2,500 just for signing up?

140
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,875
Basically, yes.

141
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:03,177
Wow! Then how come everybody
isn't in the Reserves?

142
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,513
Do people actually know
about this stuff?

143
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,951
Well, we do try
to advertise.

144
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:11,547
Oh, yeah.
"It's not a job, it's an adventure. "

145
00:08:11,624 --> 00:08:13,489
No, that's the Navy.

146
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:16,756
- "The few and the proud"?
- No, that's the Marines.

147
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:19,354
Hmm. "Keep going,
going and gone"?

148
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:22,890
- No, no. That's the, um, Energizer bunny.
- Gentlemen.

149
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:26,268
We're,
"Be all you can be. "

150
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,840
@ In the Ar-Army @

00:08:28,908 --> 00:08:30,603
You need us,
and we need you.

152
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,076
It's a win-win situation.

153
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:36,080
I got one more question.
Could I get a pen?

154
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:38,343
Oh, no. Actually, could
we just have a second...

155
00:08:38,417 --> 00:08:40,578
- uh, amongst ourselves?
- Certainly.

156
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:42,587
Take all the time
you need.

157
00:08:42,655 --> 00:08:45,783
Just hold
that ballpoint.

158
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,758
Whew.!

159
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,852
- Just one-
- C'mere.

160
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,397
This is insane!
"Why doesn't everybody join?"

161
00:08:52,465 --> 00:08:55,559
- Weren't you listening to him in there?
- Shh.

162
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:59,298
- It's like joining a health spa, only they pay us.
- You're going nuts.

163
00:08:59,405 --> 00:09:03,501
We are the beneficiaries. We get
a guaranteed check for eight years...

164
00:09:03,609 --> 00:09:06,635
- and a special skill.
- A special skill? Yeah, yeah.

165
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,680
- Look at the pamphlets.
- Yeah, here we go.

166
00:09:08,748 --> 00:09:12,149
- "Land Combat Missile Op"?
- Opportunities!

167
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,345
"Tactical Fire
Specialist"?

168
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:16,479
You heard him talkin'
about combat pay.

169
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,684
You have to be in combat to
get paid for that, right?

170
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:23,525
He said Reserves aren't called up
unless there's a major conflict.

171
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,962
- When was the last war, huh? World War ll?
- Yeah!

172
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:27,966
- No!
- Twenty years ago.

173
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:30,059
Have you ever heard
of Vietnam, huh?

174
00:09:30,136 --> 00:09:33,333
- Desert Storm? No?
- Uh-uh.

175
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:36,033
- What?
- I'm kidding. Gimme the brochure.

176
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,838
- We're gonna go to the Unemployment Office.
- Just let me see.

177
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:42,813
Let me just check. "Tank Turret Repair,
Land Mining Specialist. "

178
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:46,409
"Water purification"?
Water purification!

179
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,544
- That's it.
- What?

180
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,112
Water purification.
I'm telling you, it's a snap.

181
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:55,354
My brother's a pool man. Look, you take
dirty water and you make it clean.

182
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,988
- How hard can that be?
- I don't know.

183
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,090
And if there is a war,
what are we gonna go in there with?

184
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:03,397
Water balloons?

185
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,437
- That's- I mean- But, but-
- Jack.

186
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,496
- Yeah?
- This is for our future, okay?

187
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,009
If we can sign up now,
we get a guaranteed check for $2,500.

188
00:10:12,078 --> 00:10:14,546
If you times that
times two... Wow!

189
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:19,482
- Rrrrip! Ahh! That's $6,000.
- That's nice.

190
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,918
- I know. Yeah.
- It's a nice chunk of change.

191
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:25,947
- But, hey.
- This is for our store.

192
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:30,024
- Yeah.
- Look, I'll even give you first billing.

193
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,257
- You don't have to do that.
- No, no. "Jack's...

194
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:36,495
- and Bones's Palace of Stereos. "
- Ooh!

195
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:38,628
- Let's just do it.
- All right. Let's do it.

196
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,002
Oh, yes!

- Hi. Um-

205
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:17,600
See, everybody knows me
for my hair.

206
00:11:19,445 --> 00:11:22,209
What I need you to do
is just a little bit on the side.

207
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:25,079
Not a whole bunch.
Kinda keep it like it's still-

208
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:28,643
I'd like to see you in something short
but sassy. A real '90s look.

209
00:11:28,721 --> 00:11:31,246
Something that works as well
on the rifle range as it does in the disco.

210
00:11:32,558 --> 00:11:35,823
Okay.
That's perfect.

211
00:11:35,895 --> 00:11:39,490
@ Get a haircut
and get a real job @@

212
00:11:39,565 --> 00:11:41,726
All right.

213
00:11:45,571 --> 00:11:48,563
Aaaah!

214
00:11:53,512 --> 00:11:57,175
- Does my head- I mean, look at it.
- I don't know. Yeah.

215
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:59,410
Does it look bigger
than it did be-

216
00:11:59,485 --> 00:12:01,976
- I mean, do I look like a baked potato?
- Honestly?

217
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,080
- Yeah, honestly.
- I-It looks great. It really does.

218
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:07,887
- Really! Really?
- Really!

219
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:11,327
- It looks... macho.
- All right!

220
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:13,422
Look at these, man.
Look at these.

221
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:17,162
- Army issue.
- See, I think those are unique.

222
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,203
- Idiotic!
- No, those are unique.

223
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,762
- You're distinctive. No one has them.
- Really?

224
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,843
- You're keen. One of a kind.
- All right!

225
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:27,640
They broke the mold
when they made you,Jack.

226
00:12:46,065 --> 00:12:48,363
Bones, I can't-
I can't do it.!

227
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:51,301
- Jack, come on. You can do it.
- I can't do it, man!

228
00:12:51,403 --> 00:12:53,963
This is just like
your childhood, remember?

229
00:12:56,542 --> 00:13:00,034
Yeah, you're right.
That guy is exactly like my dad.

230
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,376
See? C'mon!

231
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,938
Wait a minute, though!
My childhood sucked!

232
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:05,950
No, I can't do it, man.
I can't-

233
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:09,681
I can't handle being yelled at by some...
muscle-bound drill sergeant.

234
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:11,689
No, man.
I can't do it.

235
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:13,987
Get the hell off
the truck!

236
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,764
Oh, whoa.

237
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,799
She can drill me
anytime.

238
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:23,027
On the double, right now!
Come on!

239
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:26,094
- Move it! Move it!
- Hello, Sweet Pants.

240
00:13:26,172 --> 00:13:28,402
Get down here!
Get down!

241
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:31,999
- Oh, rough stuff. Hi.
- And take those glasses off!.

242
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,306
- What'd you think? You're on some beach or somethin'?
- No.

243
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:38,680
- What's your name, Private?
- Bones Conway, reportin' for duty, sir!

244
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,584
I mean, ma'am,
sergeant, whatever.

245
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,748
You will address me
as Drill Sergeant.

246
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:48,123
Do you understand?

247
00:13:48,194 --> 00:13:51,595
Yes, but you don't need to yell,
'cause look, I'm standing right here.

248
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,963
I'm not yellin' at you, Private.
Drill sergeants do not yell.

249
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,832
We simply speak in a voice loud enough
so everyone can hear.

250
00:13:57,937 --> 00:14:01,202
That way we all learn
from each other's mistakes.

251
00:14:01,273 --> 00:14:03,207
Okay.
Thanks for explaining it.

252
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,403
From here on out,
your butt is mine.

253
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:09,276
You will obey
every order...

254
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,942
without question!

255
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,714
Grunt!

256
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:19,280
Oh, you're a funny boy, huh?
A cutie pie, right?

257
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:21,417
Well, I don't know ya,
but I don't even like ya.

258
00:14:21,493 --> 00:14:24,462
And I make it my personal mission
to turn you into a soldier.

259
00:14:24,530 --> 00:14:30,162
For the next eight weeks, I'll be all over
your butt like white on rice!

260
00:14:30,236 --> 00:14:33,034
Is that a promise?

261
00:14:33,138 --> 00:14:35,072
Give me 20!

262
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,166
- Well, my wallet-
- Drop and give me 20!

263
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:42,213
- Here, hold these. - You better get
on the ground and give me them push-ups.

264
00:14:42,314 --> 00:14:44,680
Agh!
It's been a while.

265
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,685
All the way up and down,
right?

266
00:14:47,753 --> 00:14:49,687
- Pump!
- Pump.

267
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:52,519
One!

268
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:54,183
Is that good?

269
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,596
Get up!
Get up!

270
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:08,298
Everybody up!

271
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:14,845
On your feet. Off the racks right now,
sleepin' beauties.

272
00:15:20,653 --> 00:15:23,486
Get your butt
off that... rack.

273
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,096
Ow! Ow! Ow!

274
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,257
- Get up!
- I'm up. I'm up.

275
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,925
I'm up!

276
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,231
Extend to the left!

277
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:40,271
Extend to the left!

278
00:15:40,339 --> 00:15:42,830
Forward!

279
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:46,844
All right...

280
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:49,073
privates, on command
begin like the last drills.

281
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:53,244
Run in place.
When I say go... go!

282
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,463
- Jack?
- Yeah?

283
00:16:06,765 --> 00:16:09,029
Where'd the sun go?

284
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:11,661
There is no sun
anymore, Bones.

285
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:14,830
The sun is gone.

286
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,965
We died,
and this is hell.

287
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,237
Oh, okay. Thanks
for explaining it.

288
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,647
Private, you've got that weapon
around backwards.

289
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,688
Oh.
Thanks.

290
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:41,026
- See the picture on the front of this weapon?
- Uh-huh.

291
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:47,835
It's put there
for privates like you.

292
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:50,741
It's idiot proof.

293
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:57,208
Seven, Drill Sergeant!
Agh!

294
00:16:57,282 --> 00:17:00,342
The gig line runs down
the seam of your shirt...

295
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:03,684
through the edge of your belt buckle,
down the seam of your zipper.

296
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:06,316
This is
a straight gig line.

297
00:17:06,392 --> 00:17:08,053
See it...

298
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:09,754
learn it...

299
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,762
do it.

300
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:17,599
From here on out...

301
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,933
anyone without
a straight gig line...

302
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,439
will have
to answer to me.

303
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:29,641
Conway,
what the hell is this?

304
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,344
Drill Sergeant, I guess my gig line
needs straightening, huh?

305
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:39,852
Ah!

306
00:17:39,925 --> 00:17:41,722
Ooh!

307
00:17:41,794 --> 00:17:43,853
Thank you,
Drill Sergeant!

308
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:46,727
Don't thank me.
Thank your recruiter.

309
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,206
C'mon, boy! C'mon!
You can't do it!

310
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:58,743
- I know you can't do it!
- Aah!

311
00:17:58,844 --> 00:18:01,244
There are two types ofbayonet fighters:;
the quick and the dead.

312
00:18:01,346 --> 00:18:03,041
- What are you?
- Quick!

313
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,276
- What are they?
- Dead!

314
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,612
- What are you?
- Quick!

315
00:18:06,685 --> 00:18:08,084
- What are they?
- Dead!

316
00:18:08,153 --> 00:18:11,554
- Any volunteers?
- Yeah!

317
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,716
- What are you, crazy?
- I sure am.

318
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,761
I'm a cr... azy boy!

319
00:18:16,829 --> 00:18:19,059
Hello!

320
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,065
- Conway.
- Yes, ma'am.

321
00:18:21,133 --> 00:18:24,398
- Come here.
- I'm on my way.

322
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,971
Whoo!

323
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,040
- Hi.
- Hit me.

324
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:31,166
Let's not fight.
C'mere.

325
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:33,437
Hit me
or you'll be sorry!

326
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:36,709
I can't hit you.
You're a girl. And...

327
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,683
I love you.

328
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:43,551
You got two seconds
to hit me.

329
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:50,591
- Okay, but this is gonna hurt.
- Any other volunteer?

330
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,563
Oh, shit!
I'm sorry.

331
00:18:54,633 --> 00:18:58,569
- I was just gonna-
- I'm gonna teach you a lesson.

332
00:18:58,670 --> 00:19:00,001
- Never...
- Ooh!

333
00:19:00,072 --> 00:19:02,165
- drop...
- Agh!

334
00:19:03,542 --> 00:19:06,511
your guard.

335
00:19:06,578 --> 00:19:10,070
Got it!

336
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,346
Can I please throw up now?

337
00:19:13,418 --> 00:19:17,013
- Aah!
- Get up! Pump! Get mad.

338
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:19,523
- Yeah, you get mad, you! Get mad!
- Thirty-eight, Drill Sergeant!

339
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,525
Listen to me
carefully.

340
00:19:21,593 --> 00:19:25,188
This is exactly the same as practice,
but this is a real, live grenade.

341
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,529
- I want you to do exactly as you've been trained.
- Yes, Drill Sergeant.

342
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,534
When I give the command
to execute...

343
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,867
- I want you to drop the pin, throw the grenade.
- Yes, Drill Sergeant.

344
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,566
- Drop the pin, throw the grenade.
- Yes, Drill Sergeant.

345
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,571
Execute.

346
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,714
Move it!

347
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:52,416
Help! Help!

348
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:58,525
Thanks, Drill Sergeant.
You saved my life.

349
00:19:58,597 --> 00:20:00,531
I owe you one.

350
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,296
No, you owe me
fifty!

351
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,644
Fifty!

352
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:19,815
@ Mama, mama
can't you see @

353
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:25,418
@ Drill Sergeant Ladd
made a man outta me @

354
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,458
...and that I will
obey the orders...

355
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,790
of the President
of the United States.

356
00:20:29,861 --> 00:20:33,695
And I will obey the orders
of the President of the United States.

357
00:20:33,765 --> 00:20:40,334
And the orders of the officers
appointed over me.

358
00:20:40,439 --> 00:20:42,407
According
to regulations...

359
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:44,237
According to regulations...

360
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,971
and the uniform code
of militaryjustice.

361
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:49,411
and the uniform code
of military justice.

362
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:53,349
- So help me God.
- So help me God.

363
00:20:53,418 --> 00:20:55,579
- You look great.!
- Nice to meet you. Bye.

364
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,316
Be good. Take care.
Bye.

365
00:20:58,390 --> 00:21:02,292
- Ah, it's the uniforms, man!
- I know.

366
00:21:02,361 --> 00:21:04,795
Pvt. Conway!

367
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,194
Never thought I'd say this,
but I think I've done the impossible:

368
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,534
- I've turned you into soldiers.
- Thank you, Drill Sergeant.

369
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:16,039
Carry on.

370
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:29,518
- Uh, is this, uh, unit 341?
- That's us, soldier.

371
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:33,251
- Bones Conway, here. This is my partnerJack.
- Hi. Christine.

372
00:21:33,325 --> 00:21:36,021
- Nice to meet you. Looks like we'll be working together.
- Good.

373
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:39,154
Christine,
a la G.I.Jane, right?

374
00:21:39,231 --> 00:21:42,826
- What brings a pretty lady
like you to water purification?

375
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,335
I wanted infantry, but
until they ax that crap...

376
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:47,405
about women not being
allowed in combat...

377
00:21:47,506 --> 00:21:51,067
- I'll just have to settle for kickin' your little butt.
- Ooh!

378
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,872
That would be nice.

379
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:57,381
Feisty one, huh?
I like that.

380
00:21:57,449 --> 00:21:59,974
Shut up.

381
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,253
I'm gonna have
to kill your friend.

382
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,258
Hey, Bones Conway.

383
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,920
Fred Ostroff.
Good to meet you.

384
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:13,055
- You okay, Fred?
- Oh, man, I'm fine. Agh!

385
00:22:13,131 --> 00:22:15,122
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

386
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:18,868
So, uh, what do you do
when you don't purify water?

387
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:22,098
Well, I'm goin' into
my final year of dental school.

388
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,540
Wow.
Now that is great.

389
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:27,601
- No, it's not.
- Why?

390
00:22:27,713 --> 00:22:30,443
Did you know that
dentists are more feared...

391
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:34,212
and loathed than any other profession?
That's including lawyers.

392
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,846
See, I don't think people
hate dentists.

393
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:39,288
It's just the sound
of that drill.

394
00:22:39,358 --> 00:22:42,816
And then they stick that sucking thing
in the back of your mouth like this.

395
00:22:42,894 --> 00:22:45,362
And the nurse says,
"I'll be right back. '"

396
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:47,728
Then theyjam those
cardboard x-ray things.

397
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:49,494
And then they-

398
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:54,005
When you have a cavity,
they take that pointy thing and they-

399
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,344
The nurse leaves,
and she goes to lunch.

400
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,309
And she jams it
back there, right?

401
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,781
Meanwhile, there is
a lead apron on the thing...

402
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,411
and you're sitting there like-

403
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,581
Can somebody...
help me?

404
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:14,216
See? That's what
I'm talkin' about.

405
00:23:14,292 --> 00:23:16,556
If you don't want
to talk about it, it's okay.

406
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,619
No, no. It's good.
We should talk about it...

407
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:21,495
'cause my therapist said
that I need to get it out.

408
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,500
Kinda like
an emotional enema.

409
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:25,934
So we talked about it
and said...

410
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:28,130
"Why not join
the Army Reserve?"

411
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:30,834
"Be all that you can be"...
on the weekends.

412
00:23:30,942 --> 00:23:32,705
Yeah.

413
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:37,841
Maybe it'd help me to face those things
in my life that I'm most afraid of.

414
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,408
- What are you afraid of?
- Uh-

415
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:45,217
Well, I'd have to say,
uh, damn near everything.

416
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:47,850
- Floss?
- Hey!

417
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,188
Keep it.

418
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:54,331
Good morning.

419
00:23:54,399 --> 00:23:59,234
Purifying our water is one of the most
vital operations in the military.

420
00:23:59,337 --> 00:24:03,398
It is absolutely vital
that you know your equipment inside...

421
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,999
and out.

422
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,443
Agh! Agh!

423
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:14,646
Two soldiers must man
the hose at all times.

424
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,984
- This is for your own safety, people.
- Okay!

425
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:21,184
Never lose control
of your hose.

426
00:24:21,259 --> 00:24:26,030
Turn it off!.

427
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:32,297
After careful training,
you will be able to produce...

428
00:24:32,404 --> 00:24:35,771
potable water from
the most disgusting, swampy...

429
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:39,777
- parasite-infected, diseased water.
- Hey, guys!

430
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:43,279
Look. It's our first glass
of purified water.

431
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:45,509
All right!

432
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:47,518
Go for it, man.
Try it.

433
00:24:47,586 --> 00:24:50,282
Nah, I'm not
gonna try.

434
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:53,882
- Here, you try it.
- I'm not gonna try it.

435
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:58,453
We should get Christine.
Yeah! She'll taste anything.

436
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:05,669
I'm not gonna try it.
Let's get Freddy.

437
00:25:05,770 --> 00:25:07,738
- Okay.
- Oh, Freddy.!

438
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:09,864
No, thanks. I'm allergic.
It'll make me break out.

439
00:25:09,975 --> 00:25:14,742
Well, then,
who's gonna try it?

440
00:25:31,229 --> 00:25:33,322
Who's the leader
of this outfit?

441
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,889
- He is. - He
is. - He is.

442
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:41,234
Son, I've been doin' this for a long time,
and I gotta say...

443
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:44,103
this is the best damn glass
of purified water...

444
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:46,905
I ever had.
Congratulations.!

445
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:49,276
Keep this up, and I'll be puttin' you in
for private first class.

446
00:25:49,347 --> 00:25:51,281
Thank you, Sergeant.

447
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:55,445
But I could not have done it without
the inspirational guidance...

448
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,421
of my brother,
the pool man!

449
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,664
Be right back, honey.

450
00:26:07,666 --> 00:26:09,759
Excuse me.

451
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,927
Better go freshen up.

452
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:17,702
Y- You're not gonna follow me
into the bathroom, Bones.

453
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:21,540
- No, come on. Bye.
- Oh, baby.

454
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:25,014
Speak-a French
and Italiano.

455
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:29,110
@Baby-babe
Let's shift together @

456
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:32,213
@And Honey-hon
Me and you @

457
00:26:33,391 --> 00:26:35,951
@And do the things
Ooh @

458
00:26:36,027 --> 00:26:38,359
@Do the things @

459
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:41,263
@ That we like to do @

460
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,200
@ Ooh
Do a little dance @

461
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:46,134
@Make a little love @

462
00:26:46,237 --> 00:26:47,636
- @ Get down tonight @
- Bones!

463
00:26:47,706 --> 00:26:51,472
- @ Get down tonight @
- Whoa-oa-oa!

464
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:55,206
- Put your clothes back on.
- Come on. He hasn't seen you in eight weeks.

465
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,305
Woof!. Woof!.

466
00:26:57,382 --> 00:27:00,408
Yeah!

467
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,919
- Honey!
- Look what I did for you. The Army did this.

468
00:27:02,988 --> 00:27:05,047
- You look buff.
- I know.

469
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,648
- Did you miss me?
- Of course I did.

470
00:27:12,864 --> 00:27:15,697
Honey, wait, wait.
Hold it here a second.

471
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:18,395
We're in the middle of a party.
Your friends might come in.

472
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:23,440
- That'd be cool.
- I think it's very rude if we stay more than a couple minutes.

473
00:27:23,541 --> 00:27:26,510
Two minutes? Perfect.
We'll have time to cuddle afterwards.

474
00:27:30,782 --> 00:27:32,977
Hold that thought.

475
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:36,020
Somebody better be dead.
Hello.

476
00:27:36,087 --> 00:27:38,419
This is
an official message.

477
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:43,154
I saw a flock of wild geese
migrating south.

478
00:27:43,228 --> 00:27:46,891
I say again, the geese
are migrating south.

479
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:50,628
Yeah? Well, my goose
is about to lay a golden egg.

480
00:27:50,702 --> 00:27:52,693
You'll have to cruise
the south solo, okay?

481
00:27:52,804 --> 00:27:54,738
Have a nice flight.

482
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,604
- Who was it?
- Someone who's into birds.

483
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,610
Caw, caw!

484
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:07,310
Look, you saw the goose.
I'm the walrus and Paul is dead.

485
00:28:07,385 --> 00:28:10,320
I'm tryin' to bury my beak here,
so give it a rest!

486
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:12,447
All right,
that's it.

487
00:28:23,835 --> 00:28:25,894
Jack!

488
00:28:26,004 --> 00:28:27,995
- Get the phone.
- Who is it?

489
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,597
It's a freak calling about
wild geese migrating.

490
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:32,677
- Hello.
- Bones!

491
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:39,778
Wha- No, don't.
Christine, don't. Look.

492
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,046
- Which way?
- Who cares?

493
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,180
- North or south?
- South.

494
00:28:45,256 --> 00:28:49,886
- Yes! Yes, yes!
- What?

495
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:51,929
You guys,
don't you remember?

496
00:28:51,996 --> 00:28:53,930
About the code?

497
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,831
So that if we got called up for active duty
then we would know it was for real.

498
00:28:56,901 --> 00:28:59,995
- It's gotta be a mistake.
- It's gotta be Chad.

499
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:03,633
Hello, Mama?
It's Frederick.

500
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,710
Uh, you sittin' down?

501
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:09,440
Chad is the African country,
the one that Libya's about to invade.

502
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,277
Uh, turn off
the music.

503
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:13,317
- Ahh! -
Ahh! - Ahh!

504
00:29:13,384 --> 00:29:17,718
Do you remember when you told me that
every Black man should visit the motherland?

505
00:29:17,789 --> 00:29:21,156
Bones, why do you think
I chose water purification?

506
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,592
- Mmm, is your brother a pool man?
- No.

507
00:29:23,661 --> 00:29:26,528
It's because Chad
is in a desert.

508
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,032
And water purification
is the Reserve occupation...

509
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,933
most likely to be called up
if there's a desert war.

510
00:29:32,036 --> 00:29:35,563
And there's a desert war,
and we're going!

511
00:29:35,673 --> 00:29:39,507
- That's it, Bones. I'm gonna kill you.
- You gotta relax here.

512
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:42,375
I'm gonna get us
outta this one.

513
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,381
Trust me.

514
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,059
At ease.

515
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,994
Sir, I know
we're going to Chad...

516
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:01,554
but there's something you need to know
aboutJack and I...

517
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:03,794
- before we go, sir.
- Yes?

518
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:09,802
Uh, Bones and I
are very close friends.

519
00:30:11,543 --> 00:30:14,876
- Very.
- Oh, I see.

520
00:30:14,946 --> 00:30:18,507
In that case, boys, I guess
you're not going to Chad.

521
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:24,446
Sorry to disappoint you,
sir.

522
00:30:26,724 --> 00:30:28,715
Uh,just one thing.

523
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,963
Anything.

524
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,589
Kiss 'im.

525
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:39,899
- 'Scuse me?
- Kiss your friend.

526
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:42,234
You don't have a problem
with that, do ya?

527
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,106
- Oh, no.
- Uh-uh.

528
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,543
He kisses me
every day.

529
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:08,461
Just do it.

530
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:15,431
Oh, shit.
Is it hot in Chad?

531
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:20,239
As the Libyan raids against U.N. forces
near the border continue...

532
00:31:20,311 --> 00:31:23,906
this U.S. force is being readied
to deter the invasion...

533
00:31:23,982 --> 00:31:28,510
threatened by the Libyan leader
in his television broadcast last night.

534
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:32,454
As the buildup here continues, the first
Army Reserve units arrived here today.

535
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:35,822
- These units will aid in the supply...
- Hello, Mama.

536
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,988
and logistical support
of the growing U.S. presence here.

537
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:41,896
These troops are in high spirits,
and the morale is high.

538
00:31:41,966 --> 00:31:43,900
- And their hopes are high that this mission...
- Soldiers, let's go!

539
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,596
will remain
a peaceful one.

540
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:49,730
Reporting live from Chad
for Worldwide News Report...

541
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,241
this is Stu Krieger.

542
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,994
I am First Sergeant
Brandon T. Williams.

543
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:13,690
It is my intention to run
this company like a clock.

544
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,861
If one gear slips in my clock,
my clock'll tell the wrong time.

545
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,201
If one spring is loose in my clock,
my clock'll tell the wrong time.

546
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:24,070
First Sgt. Williams
likes his clock to tell the right time.

547
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:28,169
- Do you understand me?
- Yes, First Sergeant!

548
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,680
- What did he say?
- I don't know. Something about his clock being broken.

549
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,618
Have my words
fallen upon deaf ears?

550
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:40,055
Yes, Sergeant!
I mean, no, Sergeant.

551
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:44,959
Don't you know
I'm your first sergeant?

552
00:32:45,029 --> 00:32:47,395
Actually, I wish you were
my first sergeant...

553
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:50,332
but I already had
a couple ones already.

554
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,533
Drop
and give me push-ups!

555
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,902
You will continue to do push-ups
until you learn...

556
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,305
to address me as First Sergeant,
is that clear?

557
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:00,367
- Yes, First Sergeant!
- Count off!.

558
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,072
One, First Sergeant.
Two, First Sergeant.

559
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:05,342
Three, First Sergeant.
Four, First Sergeant.

560
00:33:05,416 --> 00:33:08,249
- Five, First Sergeant. Six, First Sergeant.
- Don't eyeball me.

561
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,415
Seven, First Sergeant. Eight, First Sergeant.
Nine, First Sergeant.

562
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:17,951
Ten, First Sergeant. Eleven, First Sergeant.
Twelve, First Sergeant.

563
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:21,123
13, First Sergeant.
14, First Sergeant.

564
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:24,293
123, First Sergeant.
124, First Sergeant.

565
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:27,827
- 125, First Sergeant.
- That's enough. On your feet!

566
00:33:27,905 --> 00:33:31,500
Son, I bet you did a lot of push-ups
in basic training, didn't you?

567
00:33:31,609 --> 00:33:34,578
- Yes, First Sergeant. - Well, you
just did your last push-up, soldier.

568
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,512
- I will never ask you to do another.
- Thank you, First Sergeant.

569
00:33:37,582 --> 00:33:39,777
You just graduated
to peelin' potatoes.

570
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:43,446
6,543, First Sergeant.

571
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:47,787
6,544, First Sergeant.

572
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:52,421
Oh, First Sergeant.
6,545, First Sergeant. Ooh.

573
00:33:52,497 --> 00:33:55,694
Six thousand, one-
600,000...

574
00:33:55,767 --> 00:34:00,795
5,452, First Sergeant.
Shit, I lost count.

575
00:34:00,905 --> 00:34:03,738
Wait, we got it!
We got it! Look!

576
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:06,800
- Ooh!
- That's my butt!

577
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:09,744
Good one, Bones.

578
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:13,306
- @ Kumbaya @@
- Stop it!

579
00:34:21,626 --> 00:34:24,527
Oh, cool, look.
Hey.

580
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:26,859
It's a sunroof.

581
00:34:42,313 --> 00:34:46,477
Oh, look.

582
00:34:46,551 --> 00:34:49,315
Gabriella tucked a little note
into my duffel bag.

583
00:34:49,387 --> 00:34:51,719
Yeah.

584
00:34:51,789 --> 00:34:55,782
"Dear Bones, by the time you read this
I will already be-"

585
00:34:57,195 --> 00:35:01,928
What? "I will already be
in Milan with Guido. "

586
00:35:03,301 --> 00:35:07,237
Oh, she dumped ya.
Sorry, Bones.

587
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:11,207
I must say, this guy sounds really nice.
He's got a villa right on the Adriatic Sea.

588
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,403
- Jack, don't rub it in.
- No, no. You're better off.

589
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:18,347
She's a horrible speller.
There's only one "S" in loser. Look at that.

590
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:21,180
And, "immaturish"?
I don't even think that's a word.

591
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:26,246
- Gabriella, sh-she broke my heart.
- Sorry.

592
00:35:26,324 --> 00:35:30,385
Well, fortunately, I'm too shallow
to stay bummed for too long.

593
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,328
I'll take that.
Mmm.

594
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:35,262
Would you mind turning
the light off please,Jack?

595
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,267
Oh, yeah.

596
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:40,168
Fred, you checked your bag
for scorpions.

597
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:42,239
- Right?
- For scorpions?

598
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,776
- He's messing with you, Fred.
- No, I'm not.

599
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:48,641
Chad is the scorpion capital
of the world.

600
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:51,773
Yep, Fred. They're big ones too.
'Bout as big as my fist.

601
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:54,079
They outnumber people
two to one.

602
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,780
And that margin grows
with every sting.

603
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,017
So, have a good sleep,
Fred.

604
00:36:00,091 --> 00:36:02,025
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night, Bones.

605
00:36:02,093 --> 00:36:05,460
- Night, Sue Ellen.
- Night,John Boy.

606
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,098
Scorpions!

607
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:11,426
Yeah, right.

608
00:36:18,876 --> 00:36:21,344
I got one.
I got one!

609
00:36:21,412 --> 00:36:23,471
I got one.
I got one!

610
00:36:23,548 --> 00:36:25,709
I got one.
I got one!

611
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:30,550
I got one. I got one!

612
00:36:30,621 --> 00:36:33,215
I got one. I got one!
Agh!

613
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:36,692
Very funny!

614
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,662
We're just tryin' to help ya
get over your fears, Fred, really.

615
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,755
Don't worry about it.
You come sleep with me.

616
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:45,996
I'd rather take my chances
with the scorpion, thank you.

617
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,670
God, I hate this.

618
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:54,973
It's not that bad.
It's like camp.

619
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,709
@John Jacob
Jingleheimer Schmidt @

the people always shout @

622

@ There's goes John Jacob
Jingleheimer Schmidt @

623

Jingleheimer Schmidt @

625
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:17,126
- Come on!
- @ That's my name too @@

626
00:37:17,201 --> 00:37:20,295
- Shut up!
- Shut up!

627
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:49,661
Don't eat the chicken.

628
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:52,897
Man, it tastes just like frog.
Are you- Can I-

629
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:55,063
Thanks. Enjoy.

630
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:02,746
- Ready.!
- Go!

631
00:38:06,183 --> 00:38:08,242
Who are they?

632
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:10,913
- Special Forces.
- Mmm.

633
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:17,617
- 14.11 seconds.
- Damn! Try it again.

634
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,197
- Go.!
- He's incredible.

635
00:38:21,265 --> 00:38:23,256
Time me.

636
00:38:24,335 --> 00:38:26,269
All right.

637
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,606
Go!

638
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:32,507
Shoo!
Shoo! Shoo!

639
00:38:39,717 --> 00:38:41,651
- Where'd it hit?
- Oh, that's not good.

640
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,153
- What happened? Just-
- That is not good.

641
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:53,127
Oh, great.
He's comin'over.

642
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:56,064
Just don't
look at 'im.

643
00:38:56,133 --> 00:39:00,365
- You lose somethin'?
- Yeah, thanks.

644
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:03,973
You put it
in my lasagna.

645
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:07,306
You better call 911, get an ambulance,
find a doctor, order a toe tag...

646
00:39:07,378 --> 00:39:11,075
'cause I'm gonna tear off your head
and spit it down your neck, understand, boy?

647
00:39:11,882 --> 00:39:16,114
- Huh?
- Hey! Hey!

648
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:20,180
You have to relax a little.
Take it easy.

649
00:39:20,257 --> 00:39:24,193
We're in the middle of a war,
and we're on the same side.

650
00:39:27,398 --> 00:39:32,301
Would America
have won the Civil War...

651
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:35,998
if Benjamin Franklin did not get along
with Eleanor Roosevelt?

652
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:38,132
- Right on.!
- A little knowledge.

653
00:39:38,242 --> 00:39:40,039
A little knowledge
to "parter. "

654
00:39:40,111 --> 00:39:42,978
- Hmm?
- Go ahead, man.

655
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,483
If our soldiers,
our American soldiers...

656
00:39:46,550 --> 00:39:49,713
acted like this
in Desert Storm...

657
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,347
Saddam Hussein would
still be running Iraq.

658
00:39:55,059 --> 00:39:57,084
Excuse me.

659
00:39:59,196 --> 00:40:02,461
So maybe we're a bunch of Reservists
fresh off the plane, right?

660
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:04,967
It's obvious.
But you regular guys...

661
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:09,096
you've been here so long
that your brains are fried!

662
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:13,165
So I guess, what I'm
really trying to say is...

663
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:15,768
Come on, genius,
spit it out.

664
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:20,010
that doesn't mean
we all can't be friends... please.

665
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:22,416
There's only one problem
with you "newbies:"

666
00:40:22,486 --> 00:40:25,478
- Tell him the truth.
- You don't eat enough.

667
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:27,683
No, th-that's mi-

668
00:40:29,894 --> 00:40:33,728
Attention.!

669
00:40:43,641 --> 00:40:45,871
As you were.

670
00:40:50,581 --> 00:40:52,515
Son...

671
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,279
I bet the mess sergeant
could use a volunteer...

672
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,980
- to peel potatoes.
- Yes, sir!

673
00:40:58,055 --> 00:41:00,888
- Can we count on you?
- Yes, sir.

674
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:03,927
Carry on.

675
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:07,088
I happen to know, on this base
there's not one "unpeeled" potato.

676
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:24,507
I heard the Libyans are
already backing down...

677
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,210
- and we're gonna be outta here in two weeks.
- Yeah?

678
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:30,879
I hear they're sending 20,000 more troops,
and we're gonna be here 'til Christmas.

679
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:34,482
Go like that.
Wait, wait. Hey!

680
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:36,992
Where you goin'?

681
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,427
It's not like
I got bad breath.

682
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,735
Help.

683
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:50,637
And until they comply
with U.N. resolution 991...

684
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:52,972
I don't think anybody's
goin' anywhere.

685
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:55,238
You're amazing,
Christine.

686
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:58,304
How do you keep up
with all that stuff?

687
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:04,278
Christine?

688
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:10,157
All right,
quit screwin' around.

689
00:42:10,227 --> 00:42:14,323
Chris, send some water
with this mud!

690
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:22,071
Chris!

691
00:42:25,676 --> 00:42:27,769
Jack?

692
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,371
You-

693
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:34,008
Fred? Agh!

694
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:36,177
Agh!

695
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:39,245
How's it feel to be dead,
water boy?

696
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:42,486
Ooh.

697
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,085
I don't know. How does it feel
to be a dick, dick?

698
00:42:53,037 --> 00:42:55,301
Dammit!
Where's my water?

699
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:58,375
There was none delivered
last night, First Sergeant.

700
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,507
Goddamn piece of shit
"newbies. "

701
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:06,482
How am I gonna run a decent H.Q
without my coffee?

702
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:15,849
That is truly a pathetic sight.
Who perpetrated this?

703
00:43:24,001 --> 00:43:26,401
O- ooow!

704
00:43:30,074 --> 00:43:33,874
- Who did this to you?
- I can't tell you, First Sergeant.

705
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,504
What? You have
too much honor?

706
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:40,311
No-o-o! I've been
threatened with death.

707
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:43,251
Untie these clowns,
and get me some water!

708
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,912
Agh!

709
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:49,115
@I just love it any ol'way @

710
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,627
- @ I just love it any ol' way @
- Ahem.

711
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,720
I have an announcement.

712
00:43:53,797 --> 00:43:56,265
Do you guys want your water,
'cause you're lookin' a little bit crispy?

713
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:58,665
- You better wa-
- Oh, I know. I know.

714
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:02,763
Tell me if this is right.
I better call 976, find a doctor...

715
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,898
and tag an ambulance,
'cause you're gonna tear offi my toe...

716
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,840
and spit down my head,
right?

717
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:08,844
Do you guys want
your water or not?

718
00:44:08,912 --> 00:44:10,903
Sergeant.!

719
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:14,314
Report to Capt. Roberts.
You've got a mission.

720
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,853
Water boys...

721
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,514
report to First Sergeant Williams,
you've got a mission too.

722
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:22,588
Listen up!
Capt. Denby says...

723
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:26,721
we're gonna resupply the forward
U.N. peace-keeping base.

724
00:44:26,797 --> 00:44:29,823
This is a very simple,
routine mission.

725
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:33,597
You will fall into line in a very large,
very prepared convoy.

726
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:37,401
All you have to do is follow the truck
in front of you.

727
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:39,976
When your troops get thirsty,
you will give them water.

728
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,978
Conway,
you look confused.

729
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:43,980
Are you sure you wanna send us
to a forward area?

730
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:46,949
- We're just water boys.
- You are soldiers!

731
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:50,578
You will get in that convoy, and you will
be a credit to the United States Army.

732
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:52,815
- Is that clear?
- Yes, First Sergeant!

733
00:44:52,890 --> 00:44:56,849
- Then muscle your lollygaggin' butts and move out!
- Yes, First Sergeant!

734
00:45:24,121 --> 00:45:26,055
Dammit!

735
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:28,956
Forget it.
They're gonna send a tow truck.

736
00:45:31,428 --> 00:45:33,453
Man,
what I wouldn't do...

737
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:36,931
for a double-meat,
chili cheeseburger right now.

738
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:40,367
No, a margarita
on the rocks.

739
00:45:40,471 --> 00:45:42,530
Mmm.

740
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:45,608
Or some fresh,
butteryJiffy-Pop.

741
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:48,269
- That's not popcorn, boys.
- Hmm?

742
00:45:48,378 --> 00:45:50,312
That convoy's
under attack.

743
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,682
Really?
I don't think so.

744
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:02,480
- A maniac's shooting at us!
- It's not a maniac. It's the enemy!

745
00:46:02,559 --> 00:46:05,653
- What the hell are you doing?
- Surrendering! Don't shoot!

746
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,408
Damn!

747
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:22,645
Nice goin', Christine.

748
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,546
Did you have to shoot so close?
You scared the shit outta me.

749
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:29,518
Excuse me for livin'! I was just tryin'
to save your worthless little life.

750
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:32,521
Christine, are you aware that
after a near-death experience...

751
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:34,853
there's often
a desire to have sex?

752
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:37,359
- Yeah,Jack.
- That's right.

753
00:46:37,427 --> 00:46:41,022
- I feel it.
- All right!

754
00:46:41,098 --> 00:46:43,828
Just not with you...
ever!

755
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:47,359
- Got it?
- Yeah. Got it.

756
00:46:47,437 --> 00:46:51,396
- I'm glad we could have this little talk.
- I didn't feel anything.

757
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:55,501
You guys, let's get outta here
The truck's on fire!

758
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,297
Stay low. It's gonna...

759
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:22,471
explode.

760
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:26,504
Where's Bones?

761
00:47:28,111 --> 00:47:30,545
Hello!

762
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,781
Now rickity-tick
your mustering lollygaggin'.

763
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:41,951
Let's lollygaggin'
outta here!

764
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:54,534
- Isn't the road that way?
- Takin' the shortcut.

765
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:58,540
- Is there one?
- Mm-hmm. The road curves around like this.

766
00:47:58,609 --> 00:48:01,043
All we gotta do is
cut through the desert here...

767
00:48:01,144 --> 00:48:04,545
- and catch up with the convoy over there.
- Watch out!

768
00:48:04,615 --> 00:48:06,515
I think I know
what I'm doing here.

769
00:48:06,583 --> 00:48:11,316
I guess this is the wrong time
to tell you guys I get very easily carsick.

770
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,299
Bones, I don't see a road.

771
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:33,775
I have the best sense of direction
of anyone you know. The road's over there.

772
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:37,177
Three miles...
maybe four.

773
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:40,910
Oh,yeah.
Maybe ten, maybe twenty.

774
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:43,009
Maybe our truck
is sinking.

775
00:48:44,888 --> 00:48:46,685
No-o-o!

776
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:05,166
Push!

777
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,802
Forget it, okay? Just shut it down.
We'll dig it out.

778
00:49:08,912 --> 00:49:11,540
Just stand back. Stand back.
I'm gonna rock it.

779
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:19,548
Will you quit?
It's not working.

780
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,990
You're sucking too much sand
into the air filter.

781
00:49:23,060 --> 00:49:27,827
- I order you... to shut it down now!
- You order me?

782
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:31,356
I'm Private First Class. Okay?
I'm ordering you. Come on.

783
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:34,029
The only reason
you made...

784
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:36,435
private first class...

785
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:39,236
is because your brother's
a pool man.

786
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:46,709
Huh?
You happy?

787
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:49,911
Get off!.

788
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:53,320
I hope you brought
your Triple "A" cards.

789
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,654
Let's see.

790
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:02,457
Well, look.
You cracked the block.

791
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:05,865
- I could've done it if you hadn't stopped me.
- You're so full of it.

792
00:50:05,936 --> 00:50:08,029
- You know what?
- Shut up.!

793
00:50:08,138 --> 00:50:10,299
We gotta figure out
what we're gonna do.

794
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:13,205
Why don't you just ask
our fearless leader here?

795
00:50:13,276 --> 00:50:16,211
Pvt. First Class Bones,
the one with the highest rank.

796
00:50:16,279 --> 00:50:19,009
All you had to do,Jack,
was just listen to me.

797
00:50:19,082 --> 00:50:22,449
All I've ever done is listen to you,
and look where it's taken me.

798
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:26,421
Look! We're in the middle
of some African hellhole...

799
00:50:26,490 --> 00:50:29,789
under a flesh-frying sun
with the sky filled with vultures...

800
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,261
ready to pluck out
my eyeballs.

801
00:50:33,330 --> 00:50:36,766
Vultures don't come around
unless something's about to die.

802
00:50:52,783 --> 00:50:57,186
Are you ripping the sleeves
off your jacket?

803
00:50:57,254 --> 00:51:00,052
That's gonna look sexy.

804
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:03,890
Jack, tomorrow we have to walk
away from this water truck.

805
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,087
We have two canteens
between us.

806
00:51:06,163 --> 00:51:09,155
We're gonna fill up the sleeves with water
and then we have more water.

807
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:12,531
Am I the only person
who paid attention in survival class?

808
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:19,507
There's a scorpion
on my back!

809
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:23,740
That's enough!
There's not a scorpion on your back!

810
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:28,078
Uh-uh. There is
a scorpion on my back!

811
00:51:28,151 --> 00:51:30,745
Fred, there's nothing
on your back.

812
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:34,018
You keep on
imagining things.

813
00:51:35,725 --> 00:51:38,751
Thank you.
I needed that.

814
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:41,798
I'm sorry I snapped.

815
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:44,595
You don't have
to apologize.

816
00:51:44,668 --> 00:51:48,627
You're right!
I see things very clear now.

817
00:51:48,705 --> 00:51:50,832
All right.
Right!

818
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:53,205
Guys, I want to apologize
to everybody. Okay?

819
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:55,574
- He's okay.
- I feel like a brand-new man.

820
00:51:55,645 --> 00:51:57,772
- Now, can we get some rest?
- Okay.

821
00:51:57,848 --> 00:52:00,248
Thank you.

822
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,291
What are you doing?

823
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:13,488
Just felt like going-

824
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:16,157
You're always playing!

825
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:19,430
Did you guys see that thing?
It was-

826
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:31,111
Follow me. I know
exactly where I'm goin'.

827
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:33,843
@ When all
there's left to do @

828
00:52:33,917 --> 00:52:35,646
Trust me.

829
00:52:35,719 --> 00:52:38,153
@ 'Cause you're fightin'
what's been done @

830
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:43,989
@ This is where
sadness breathes @

831
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:48,224
@ The sadness
of everyone @

832
00:52:48,298 --> 00:52:51,790
@Just like when the guys
quit the damn at Otter Creek @

833
00:52:51,868 --> 00:52:54,462
@And all the water
backed up @

834
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:57,802
@Deep enough to die @

835
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:02,272
You guys, get down.
I see something. Get down!

836
00:53:12,822 --> 00:53:15,848
It's a truck! There's the road.
We are saved!

837
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,895
I told you I had
a flawless sense of direction.

838
00:53:20,964 --> 00:53:23,558
What a coincidence.!
That truck looks-

839
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:27,228
That looks like our truck.

840
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:37,840
Listen you guys. Hey. I figured out
why we went in circles.

841
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:40,280
Do you remember
our map-reading class?

842
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:43,683
We didn't follow the sun!

843
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:49,622
Look, this stream
is due west.

844
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:52,560
All we have to do is walk away
from the sun in the morning...

845
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:56,224
towards the sun in the afternoon
and we should be there by nightfall.

846
00:53:56,299 --> 00:54:00,429
So you're saying we should risk
being dried up into human jerky again...

847
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:03,563
just to follow another one
of your half-baked plans.

848
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:07,370
I'm not saying anything, okay?
I mean, I'm pretty sure this is gonna work.

849
00:54:07,444 --> 00:54:10,880
But since I let us down before,
I say from here on in...

850
00:54:10,947 --> 00:54:13,142
we put everything
to a vote.

851
00:54:13,216 --> 00:54:15,776
We can't vote.
You order.

852
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:18,878
- We follow.
- Okay, well I order us to vote.

853
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:22,982
That is not how the Army goes.
You have to tell us what to do.

854
00:54:23,059 --> 00:54:25,391
What if I'm wrong?

855
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:29,599
Then... we die.

856
00:54:34,971 --> 00:54:37,303
I order us...

857
00:54:37,374 --> 00:54:40,639
to do a sunbaked...
plan thing.

858
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:43,543
We're dead.

859
00:54:45,815 --> 00:54:50,411
Hey, guys,just think of it
as a very long day...

860
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:54,753
on a very big beach
in a very dry year.

861
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:14,337
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey.

862
00:55:14,411 --> 00:55:16,606
Wait a minute.
It's the ocean.

863
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,773
I don't see anything.

864
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:21,282
What, are you blind?
Th-The waves!

865
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:23,285
It's the ocean.!

866
00:55:23,353 --> 00:55:25,617
It's a mirage!

867
00:55:25,689 --> 00:55:28,453
It is a mirage!
And there's Caesars.

868
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:33,394
Right across the street is the Barbary
Coast where you can get a $3.99 buffet.

869
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:37,229
It's the ocean!
Come on!

870
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:40,030
Come on.!
Let's go.!

871
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:44,266
Come on!
First one in!

872
00:55:44,374 --> 00:55:46,535
Come on.!

873
00:55:58,254 --> 00:56:02,588
Here's a canteen. Go get your boy
'cause he's buggin'.

874
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:18,196
Are you okay, man?
Are you okay? Here.

875
00:56:18,308 --> 00:56:20,868
Take a sip.

876
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:22,945
Listen.

877
00:56:23,012 --> 00:56:25,276
Look,Jack,
we got two choices:

878
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:28,943
One, we could put your clothes back on,
get ourselves out of this mess.

879
00:56:29,018 --> 00:56:33,250
Go back to Glendale. Start up our
own store. Become rich and famous!

880
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:37,020
Or two, you can lie here
butt-naked and crust away...

881
00:56:37,093 --> 00:56:39,459
leaving your skull to be found
by a young Arabic prince...

882
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:41,724
that's gonna use it
for an ashtray.

883
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:47,693
You don't want that
in your head.

884
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:49,931
You make the call.
Come on, let's get outta here.

885
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:53,534
What do you say?
Come on.

886
00:56:53,643 --> 00:56:56,976
Here. Here.

887
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:01,883
Come on.

888
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:09,657
Hey. Oh,Jack,
look at that ass!

889
00:57:09,726 --> 00:57:13,753
Maybe you should stay naked,
get some sun on those cheeks.

890
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,536
- What?
- Man, now I'm seeing things.

891
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:27,132
The palm trees
right on the horizon.

892
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:29,643
It's another mirage.

893
00:57:29,712 --> 00:57:32,681
- Oh, my god, I see it too.
- It's not a mirage.

894
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:36,309
Those are the palm trees!
It's the oasis!

895
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:40,618
Oh, man.
You saved our lives!

896
00:57:44,794 --> 00:57:47,763
Where's my kiss?
Christine?

897
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:59,306
This stream was due west.
It was on the map, right?

898
00:57:59,409 --> 00:58:01,775
Where's the water?

899
00:58:03,079 --> 00:58:05,309
This is... sand!

900
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,515
Nobody move.

901
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:17,192
There is a big snake
right by your feet.

902
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:23,431
Thanks for not movin',
Jack.

903
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:27,059
Throw me the gun.

904
00:58:27,136 --> 00:58:30,867
If you don't attack it,
it'll go away.

905
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,932
I- I don't want it to go away.
I want to have it for dinner.

906
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:36,034
Throw me... the gun.

907
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:50,052
You want some of this, baby?

908
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:53,926
There you go. Come on.!

909
00:58:53,997 --> 00:58:57,262
Oh, no. I'm still
gonna getcha!

910
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,834
You're gonna die, vermin!
I'll kill ya!

911
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,836
Huh?
Shudda-budda-da-da-da!

912
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:18,146
Huh?
It's a win-win situation.

913
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:22,518
Would you look
at that!

914
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:24,651
Water from the bullet hole.

915
00:59:28,464 --> 00:59:30,864
Water.! Yeah.!

916
00:59:30,934 --> 00:59:33,869
Water! Water!

917
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:37,839
Fresh water!
I can't believe it!

918
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:40,239
Is it snake yet?

919
00:59:40,343 --> 00:59:43,870
- Depends how you like it.
- Well done!

920
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:47,006
He used to be afraid of scorpions,
now he's eatin' snake!

921
00:59:47,116 --> 00:59:49,209
That is impressive,
Fred.

922
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:52,982
I thought
we were all gonna die.

923
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:56,651
But you pulled us through.

924
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,058
I don't know how...

925
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:01,596
but thank you.

926
01:00:11,274 --> 01:00:14,402
That was, uh...

927
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,478
pretty exceptional.

928
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:19,514
So what are you gonna do
if I get us rescued?

929
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:23,876
Um...

930
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:26,444
I will...

931
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:28,683
take off all
your clothes...

932
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:33,256
tie you to the bed...

933
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:38,859
rub warm oil
all over your body...

934
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:43,599
from the bottom of those feet
to the top of that head...

935
01:00:43,673 --> 01:00:47,131
and proceed to have
the nastiest...

936
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:51,112
freakiest sex with you
that you have ever imagined.

937
01:00:51,180 --> 01:00:53,705
Wow.

938
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:57,445
Oh, that's it. Dammit!
I saw her first!

939
01:00:57,520 --> 01:01:01,422
And look what happens!
The same thing that happened with Gabriella.

940
01:01:01,491 --> 01:01:04,085
I saw her first.
And Wanda Tushman.

941
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,253
In the third grade.
I saw her first.!

942
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:09,730
And that girl in Palm Springs
that turned out to be the guy.

943
01:01:09,799 --> 01:01:14,862
I saw that thing first too. You know why
I'm not just strangling you right now?

944
01:01:14,937 --> 01:01:16,962
'Cause you
can't cook a snake?

945
01:01:17,040 --> 01:01:18,974
No.

946
01:01:19,075 --> 01:01:21,976
Because no matter how long
we've been friends...

947
01:01:22,045 --> 01:01:26,345
I never thought you'd be the kind of guy
that would save our lives...

948
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:28,509
let alone kill a snake.

949
01:01:28,584 --> 01:01:31,917
- But you did.
- Hey, man, thanks.

950
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:35,919
I think it's the U.N. flag.

951
01:01:35,992 --> 01:01:38,483
We're saved!

952
01:01:38,561 --> 01:01:42,122
- Guys, Christine and I are gonna need some time alone.
- Sure, man!

953
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:49,670
...President in the situation
room of the White House.

954
01:01:49,739 --> 01:01:54,039
The President is scheduled to address
the nation tomorrow at 6:;00 P.M.

955
01:01:54,143 --> 01:01:56,236
Welcome.

956
01:01:56,345 --> 01:02:00,714
You are the Reservists
from Glendale, California. Correct?

957
01:02:00,783 --> 01:02:04,742
According to W.N.R.,
you are presumed dead in a truck explosion.

958
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:07,187
Hmm, where are we?

959
01:02:07,256 --> 01:02:12,057
You are on a military base
well inside Libya.

960
01:02:12,128 --> 01:02:13,755
That is all
you need to know.

961
01:02:13,830 --> 01:02:18,733
Oh, I forgot to mention.
The war is starting tomorrow.

962
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:22,897
- How'd you know that?
- American TV.

963
01:02:22,972 --> 01:02:26,464
Your country is expected to start bombing
our air bases tomorrow.

964
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:28,908
When that happens...

965
01:02:28,978 --> 01:02:32,573
we will unleash missiles with chemical
warheads against your bases.

966
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:35,276
Consider yourself lucky
to be here.

967
01:02:35,351 --> 01:02:37,751
Sleep well.

968
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:42,553
You know, this is fine. It's like the time
you got us arrested in Tijuana.

969
01:02:42,625 --> 01:02:44,820
Except we're in Libya.

970
01:02:44,894 --> 01:02:49,092
And your dad's not gonna
pick us up here, brother.

971
01:02:49,165 --> 01:02:52,532
Yo, aren't you guys
also American?

972
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:57,539
Ah, see. I see.

973
01:02:57,607 --> 01:03:01,543
I was wounded and... I don't feel well.
Please sing a song to comfort me.

974
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:04,772
- Sing a song?
- Any song!

975
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:08,817
Oh, because of the thing-
- Oh, okay.

976
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:12,479
@ Rescue me @
Sing.

977
01:03:12,555 --> 01:03:17,356
@ I want your tender charms
'Cause I'm so lonely @

978
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:19,189
@And I'm blue @

979
01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:22,595
- My team was on strategic recon.
- Oh?

980
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:25,327
You know, that's when
you go behind enemy lines...

981
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:27,961
and try to locate their
assets like tanks, bunkers.

982
01:03:28,037 --> 01:03:30,938
We were on our way to a resupply drop
and we were ambushed.

983
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:33,168
- The other guys were killed.
- Killed?

984
01:03:33,276 --> 01:03:35,506
@I need you
by my side @

985
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:37,738
@ Can't you see
that I'm lonely @

986
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:40,338
I took a bullet in the leg,
and they brought me here.

987
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:43,145
@ Uh-huh, I don't know
any words to this song @

988
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:45,813
- @ Kiss me, baby @
- @ Kiss me, baby @

989
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:48,584
@Kiss me, baby,yeah
Hold me, baby @

990
01:03:48,658 --> 01:03:50,558
@Love me, baby @

991
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:54,255
Use this to dig around
the base of the bars on the window.

992
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:58,767
- I got one of them loose already.
- Escape? What are you, crazy?

993
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:01,565
- @ Ahh, oh-ho @
- @ Uh-huh @

994
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:04,765
Look. It's the duty of every P.O.W.
to try to escape.

995
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:08,072
We're in the middle of a desert.
What good is it gonna do for us to escape?

996
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,475
To complete the recon
mission, soldier.

997
01:04:10,546 --> 01:04:13,879
The special operations cargo plane
was instructed to make a supply drop...

998
01:04:13,950 --> 01:04:17,215
at a rendezvous point
about 15 K north of here.

999
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:19,846
If we can get off this base, I
can get us to the rendezvous point.

1000
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:22,413
You're insane. The Libyans are
gonna launch chemical weapons.

1001
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:27,360
- We're much safer here.
- No. I'm a soldier, and I've got a job to do.

1002
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:31,867
And so are you.
Now get to work... Private.

1003
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:33,925
@ Lonely @

1004
01:04:34,003 --> 01:04:37,234
@ Yeah, rescue me
Pretty baby @@

1005
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:50,682
- Bones.
- Ah-ah, ah-ha.

1006
01:04:52,521 --> 01:04:54,352
My heart.

1007
01:04:54,423 --> 01:04:58,120
You know what? You didn't scare me.
I just felt like screaming.

1008
01:04:58,194 --> 01:05:02,096
Don't worry about it.
Most men think I'm scary.

1009
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:07,461
- You can't sleep, huh?
- I'm too excited.

1010
01:05:07,536 --> 01:05:11,495
Excited? They might torture us tomorrow.
They might even kill us.

1011
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,566
I know. It's just like
the night before Christmas.

1012
01:05:14,677 --> 01:05:17,145
Yeah, well at my house
we got presents.

1013
01:05:17,246 --> 01:05:21,012
I'm talking about
the anticipation.

1014
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:24,883
We might die!
We, we, we might escape.

1015
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:28,617
We don't know what's gonna happen.
That's the coolest thing in the world.

1016
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:31,751
Most girls are into
horses and stuff.

1017
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:33,761
You're weird.

1018
01:05:34,797 --> 01:05:37,425
Most men say that too.

1019
01:05:38,167 --> 01:05:41,136
I like it.

1020
01:05:41,203 --> 01:05:43,728
You do?

1021
01:05:43,806 --> 01:05:46,866
Yeah.
Horses are boring.

1022
01:05:53,215 --> 01:05:55,513
So...

1023
01:05:55,584 --> 01:05:59,111
if I do get us out of here,
and I will...

1024
01:05:59,188 --> 01:06:03,648
is it true what you said about tying me up
and all the wild sex stuff?

1025
01:06:03,726 --> 01:06:06,524
Only if you kiss me again.

1026
01:06:08,397 --> 01:06:10,365
Okay.

1027
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:14,930
Okay, wait.
Wait a minute.

1028
01:06:15,004 --> 01:06:17,438
I think I got it.
Wait, look at it.

1029
01:06:17,506 --> 01:06:19,167
- You got it.
- Look at it.

1030
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:23,405
Oh! Oh!

1031
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:26,538
Stern?

1032
01:06:26,649 --> 01:06:30,176
Stern, you gotta wake up.
I can't turn the alarm off.

1033
01:06:30,252 --> 01:06:32,277
It's not an alarm.
It's an air-raid siren.

1034
01:06:32,355 --> 01:06:35,347
Oh, thank God!

1035
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:38,257
I thought I was having
another panic attack.

1036
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,114
It's okay,
it's okay.

1037
01:07:17,900 --> 01:07:19,993
Yes.

1038
01:07:22,405 --> 01:07:25,966
Almost.
Try it again.

1039
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:28,066
Okay. Cross yo-

1040
01:07:32,681 --> 01:07:35,548
That was good. Just a little more
to the left and you got 'em.

1041
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:38,109
You guys just keep trying.

1042
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:41,418
Do you guys realize
what we are doing right now?

1043
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:44,687
This is a scene from
Pirates of the Caribbean.

1044
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:48,628
All we need is that
mangy dog, right?

1045
01:07:48,697 --> 01:07:51,097
Quiet. Just try it again.

1046
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:12,520
Hey.

1047
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:23,459
How much do you love me?

1048
01:08:32,708 --> 01:08:35,905
I'm sorry, I don't get it.
What is it with us and trucks?

1049
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:38,138
We get 'em, we break 'em,
we smash 'em, we crash 'em.

1050
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:41,444
- We run out of gas. I don't get it!
- Yes, I understand that.

1051
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:45,180
But we're not getting tortured
by Babaga-douche right now, okay?

1052
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:48,655
No, instead we're lost
in the desert... again.

1053
01:08:48,724 --> 01:08:51,090
Without food and water...
again.

1054
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:55,460
Stuck with this Special Forces guy. He can't
even walk 'cause he got his leg shot off.

1055
01:08:55,531 --> 01:08:58,989
- Fred, we're free!
- Yeah, and we're gonna die free!

1056
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:01,536
Or maybe not.

1057
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:10,537
Fifty-five American dollars.

1058
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:14,207
Then on top of it,
see this truck?

1059
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:18,117
Serious, bona fide Libyan Army
fighting machine.

1060
01:09:18,187 --> 01:09:21,179
And it's all part of
this amazing offer, my friend.

1061
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,987
I mean, if you're lucky, it
might even have a Kuwait track.

1062
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:28,189
You can play
stuff on it.

1063
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:31,631
Huh? And you ask me, how could it be?
Why such a deal?

1064
01:09:31,700 --> 01:09:36,501
Because we're Crazy Boys!
We're givin' it away!

1065
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,778
Hmm?

1066
01:09:43,846 --> 01:09:46,212
You like this watch?

1067
01:09:46,282 --> 01:09:48,876
- Is it interesting?
- No, no, no, no, no.

1068
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:51,010
- Not the watch.
- He likes it.

1069
01:09:51,086 --> 01:09:53,816
Come on. It's got the faces
of the moon and a compass.

1070
01:09:55,124 --> 01:09:57,820
- What? This has a compass?
- Yeah.

1071
01:09:57,893 --> 01:10:01,192
Really? We've been stuck
in the desert for three days...

1072
01:10:01,263 --> 01:10:03,823
- and you're telling me this watch has a compass.
- Sorry.

1073
01:10:03,899 --> 01:10:08,393
Oh,Jack, you're gonna get some
noogies later. I'm gonna pound you like this.

1074
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:10,370
I forgot.

1075
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:15,103
Well, you're gonna forget about
your little watch here, because it's gone!

1076
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,509
Uh-huh.
Here you go, my friend.

1077
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,639
Hey,you guys.
In my life...

1078
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:23,878
I've seen
a lot of camels' toes...

1079
01:10:23,953 --> 01:10:26,387
but I've never seen one
on a camel.

1080
01:10:26,455 --> 01:10:31,552
- I think he's got a crush on you, Bones.
- Really? How can you tell?

1081
01:10:31,627 --> 01:10:35,393
- 'Cause he's been nibbling on your ears.
- Yeah?

1082
01:10:35,464 --> 01:10:37,523
And licking
on your neck.

1083
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,898
It's okay.

1084
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:42,403
You're just a camel.

1085
01:10:44,039 --> 01:10:47,031
Our supply drop's
on the other side of that Libyan base.

1086
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,043
What Libyan base?

1087
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:51,045
Are you blind?

1088
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:54,947
- It's a Libyan base covered with a camo tent.
- What are you talking about?

1089
01:10:55,017 --> 01:10:58,817
- I guess we're gonna have to go around it.
- Around what?

1090
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:02,948
- See thatjeep right there?
- I see thejeep, but I don't-

1091
01:11:03,025 --> 01:11:08,861
Oh! You mean that Libyan base,
the one under the camo tent!

1092
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:13,095
I thought you guys were talking
about some other Libyan base.

1093
01:11:13,168 --> 01:11:15,398
Will there be
medical supplies?

1094
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:18,702
Medical supplies, uniforms, food,
water, radio. Everything you need.

1095
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:21,504
But where is it?
It's supposed to be right here.

1096
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:26,441
Hey, you guys!
Come on!

1097
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:29,609
Hey, come on, you guys!

1098
01:11:29,685 --> 01:11:32,449
What is it?
Oh!

1099
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:34,716
Whoo-hoo!

1100
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:36,849
Whoo!

1101
01:11:51,206 --> 01:11:53,197
Hot Wheels!

1102
01:12:06,288 --> 01:12:10,816
Stern, these things are intense!
No wonder people join the Army.

1103
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:13,691
@ Be all
that you can be @

1104
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:15,730
@ In the Army @

1105
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:17,561
What happened to him?

1106
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:21,967
His leg looks pretty bad. I think it's infected
'cause he lost a lot of blood.

1107
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,369
But look at his gums!
They're fabulous, man.

1108
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:27,068
Not a touch of gingivitis.
He's been flossing.

1109
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:30,202
- Yeah, but why is he acting so wasted?
- That's the morphine.

1110
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:32,974
Absolutely!
The "morphine," the better.

1111
01:12:34,750 --> 01:12:37,913
Hello.!
Somebody answer us, please.!

1112
01:12:37,986 --> 01:12:40,853
You gotta believe us.
We're stuck out here in the middle-

1113
01:12:40,923 --> 01:12:43,255
Get ahold of yourself,
soldier.

1114
01:12:43,325 --> 01:12:45,520
Thank God it's you!

1115
01:12:45,594 --> 01:12:47,994
- Listen-
- Don't say my name.

1116
01:12:48,063 --> 01:12:50,896
What did I say to you
when you first arrived in Chad?

1117
01:12:50,966 --> 01:12:54,367
Uh, something about
your clock being broken.

1118
01:12:54,436 --> 01:12:56,028
Close enough.

1119
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:59,074
Okay, calm down, son,
we're gonna get you outta there.

1120
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:03,304
Listen carefully.
Your call sign is now Glendale.

1121
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:06,506
Our call sign
is now Burbank.

1122
01:13:06,615 --> 01:13:08,776
Did you recover the fast-attack vehicles,
Glendale?

1123
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:12,446
Oh, you mean those dune buggies!
Yeah, those things are intense.

1124
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:14,716
Good. This equipment
was intended...

1125
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:17,918
for the Special Forces team
to carry out a vital mission.

1126
01:13:17,993 --> 01:13:21,087
You are our only assets
on the ground...

1127
01:13:21,163 --> 01:13:23,859
with the right equipment
in the right place.

1128
01:13:23,932 --> 01:13:27,333
- Say what?
- You have to take over, Glendale.

1129
01:13:27,403 --> 01:13:29,530
Listen.
Let me explain something.

1130
01:13:29,605 --> 01:13:32,301
First of all, Sergeant,
we're water boys.

1131
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:36,276
- Okay, please-
- You're soldiers first, Glendale!

1132
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:38,472
Now, listen up.

1133
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:42,311
The Libyans have a mobile scud
launching base right in your area.

1134
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:47,151
These scuds are loaded with chemical
weapons and targeted at U.S. bases.

1135
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:50,350
Our aerial photographs
haven't been able to find them.

1136
01:13:50,426 --> 01:13:52,656
You want us to find 'em?
What about Stern?

1137
01:13:52,728 --> 01:13:55,162
Stern can find 'em.
He'll be up pretty soon. Stern?

1138
01:13:55,230 --> 01:13:58,722
Daddy, why can't I go
to ballet class?

1139
01:13:58,801 --> 01:14:00,894
Teacher says
I'm a natural.

1140
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:02,800
These scuds...

1141
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:06,329
can't be spotted from the air
because of heavy camouflage.

1142
01:14:06,408 --> 01:14:10,708
Camouflage? Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

1143
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:13,043
Listen, we saw the thing
this morning.

1144
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:15,549
Stern wrote down the coordinates.
Right, Stern?

1145
01:14:15,617 --> 01:14:19,314
We'll tell you where it is. You guys can
come here and bomb the hell outta it!

1146
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:23,154
- Come on. Send the Air Force.
- It's not enough to tell us.

1147
01:14:23,225 --> 01:14:25,853
You have to go back there
and paint it.

1148
01:14:25,928 --> 01:14:29,921
Paint it? Trust me.
It looks perfectly fine the way it is.

1149
01:14:29,998 --> 01:14:32,159
I mean paint it
with the laser.

1150
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:35,601
The laser target designator.
It's in your equipment.

1151
01:14:35,671 --> 01:14:38,435
All you have to do
is return to that base...

1152
01:14:38,507 --> 01:14:41,840
point the laser at it,
and call me back on the radio.

1153
01:14:41,944 --> 01:14:44,208
The Air Force
will do the rest.

1154
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:47,248
You can be a mile away
in perfect safety.

1155
01:14:47,316 --> 01:14:49,876
All right.
Wait a minute.

1156
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:52,546
- Chris? Get over here.
- What?

1157
01:14:52,621 --> 01:14:55,818
They can't make us do anything.
We don't know how to use this stuff.

1158
01:14:55,891 --> 01:14:59,418
Fred,you use lasers
in dentistry, right?

1159
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:02,692
I know what's goin' on! You're gonna try
to make the brother hold the laser, right?

1160
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:05,062
No. My laser was a little,
itty-bitty laser.

1161
01:15:05,133 --> 01:15:07,294
This is a big laser.
There's a difference.

1162
01:15:07,369 --> 01:15:10,236
- Glendale? Glendale.!
- No.

1163
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:12,273
Can't they just evacuate
the bases?

1164
01:15:12,341 --> 01:15:16,368
Or we can take an hour out of our
busy lives, hop in these cool dune buggies...

1165
01:15:16,478 --> 01:15:19,845
pop the base with the laser, and let
the Air Force blow the hell out of it!

1166
01:15:19,915 --> 01:15:23,851
- You listen to me, Glendale!
- Please hold yourself there one second.

1167
01:15:23,952 --> 01:15:26,443
I'm just trying to have
a moment with my friends. Is that okay?

1168
01:15:26,522 --> 01:15:28,820
Have a cup of java.
Please chill.

1169
01:15:30,926 --> 01:15:33,952
Fred, when you
first got here...

1170
01:15:34,029 --> 01:15:36,657
- you were completely freaked, right?
- Yeah.

1171
01:15:36,732 --> 01:15:39,701
Now look at you. Huh?
You're a regular G.I.Joe.

1172
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:42,202
A fightin' man
from head to toe!

1173
01:15:42,271 --> 01:15:45,331
And, Chris,
you wanted infantry.

1174
01:15:45,407 --> 01:15:48,843
Well, now's your chance.
Let's see what you've got.

1175
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:55,046
And,Jack, my friend,
you were a complete screwup.

1176
01:15:55,117 --> 01:15:57,915
But now look at you.
You're still a screwup.

1177
01:15:57,986 --> 01:16:00,420
But if you did this
and you survived...

1178
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:02,980
you'd have stuff to tell
your little screw-up grandkids.

1179
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:04,992
Basically, you guys,
up to a few months ago...

1180
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:08,291
we were all a bunch of minimum wage losers
from Glendale.

1181
01:16:08,363 --> 01:16:10,923
But this whole event
has changed our lives!

1182
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:14,457
You know who we owe it to?
@ The Army @@

1183
01:16:14,536 --> 01:16:17,505
This is something we gotta do!
Come on! Get on with it!

1184
01:16:17,573 --> 01:16:21,600
- Chris, I know you're with me.
- Yeah, boy.

1185
01:16:21,710 --> 01:16:25,077
Fred, listen, if you can't handle it,
I understand, man.

1186
01:16:25,147 --> 01:16:26,671
I can handle it.

1187
01:16:26,782 --> 01:16:29,273
Jack, what do you say,
man?

1188
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:32,876
Oh, I say,
I say you're crazy.

1189

I think you're all nuts.!

1190

But you're the private first class.
I'm the private.

1191
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:41,251
And I'm gonna follow you,
my friend, wherever.

1192
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:44,731
All right, you guys, let's do this thing.
Kick it, man!

1193
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:47,496
Stern, you ready?

1194
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:50,868
- Let's go, Bones.!
- I know, I know.

1195
01:16:50,939 --> 01:16:55,273
There's just a little bit of business
I have to take care of.

1196
01:16:57,412 --> 01:16:59,972
You're gonna have
to go now.

1197
01:17:00,015 --> 01:17:05,476
You're gonna have to go be
all the camel that you can be.

01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:14,210
All right.
Glendale to Burbank. Come in.

1212
01:18:14,289 --> 01:18:17,486
- I wish we had cooler code names.
- What was that, Glendale?

1213
01:18:17,559 --> 01:18:20,687
Nothing. I was just saying
that these code names suck.

1214
01:18:20,762 --> 01:18:22,787
Can I call you
General Sweet Pants?

1215
01:18:22,864 --> 01:18:26,129
You better remember who you're talking to,
Glendale. Are you in position?

1216
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:29,329
Guy's got no sense of humor.
Yeah, we can see the target.

1217
01:18:29,404 --> 01:18:32,032
Have you painted it
with the laser?

1218
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:36,210
Just did.

1219
01:18:36,278 --> 01:18:39,941
Good goin', Glendale.
The air strike is inbound.

1220
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:42,779
You should acquire the target
in seven minutes.

1221
01:18:42,851 --> 01:18:48,289
It is vital that you do not take the laser
off the target until the target is destroyed.

1222
01:18:48,356 --> 01:18:50,187
Can you hold it there
for seven minutes?

1223
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:54,126
I got it propped up here on the rock!
I can hold it all day. I'm good to go!

1224
01:18:54,196 --> 01:18:56,460
No problem, Burbank.

1225
01:18:56,531 --> 01:18:58,829
Good! Lay low.

1226
01:18:58,900 --> 01:19:01,095
And report any change
in situation.

1227
01:19:01,169 --> 01:19:04,605
We'll be standing by.
Out.

1228
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:23,419
Come on!

1229
01:19:27,329 --> 01:19:30,526
Tell me again
about the store.

1230
01:19:30,599 --> 01:19:34,160
Ah, the store.
It's gonna be great!

1231
01:19:34,236 --> 01:19:37,797
We're gonna have our own room
where people can get their feet massaged-

1232
01:19:58,093 --> 01:19:59,685
Burbank.!

1233
01:19:59,761 --> 01:20:01,888
Burbank,
we're under attack.

1234
01:20:01,963 --> 01:20:05,421
Hold your position, Glendale.
And keep that laser on the target.

1235
01:20:05,500 --> 01:20:09,027
On the target?
We are the target.!

1236
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:12,067
Tell 'em to hurry up!

1237
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:15,940
You better hurry. We've got 60 pissed-off
Libyans headin' towards us.

1238
01:20:16,044 --> 01:20:17,671
Stay with it!

1239
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:25,542
- Let's get these guys,Jack. Okay.
- Come on.

1240
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,713
- We know how to do it.
- All right.

1241
01:20:27,789 --> 01:20:31,418
This is for
the Glendale water boys!

1242
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:42,499
- Not bad, huh?
- Whoo!

1243
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:05,756
Reload.

1244
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:15,764
Turn it!

1245
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:43,954
Shit!

1246
01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:47,024
- They missed.
- At least they didn't blow up my head.

1247
01:21:48,803 --> 01:21:52,261
- Great going, soldiers. We knew you could do it.
- Oh, Burbank?

1248
01:21:52,340 --> 01:21:56,003
I'm gonna find you the biggest
bottle of champagne in Chad!

1249
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:58,978
Don't pop the cork yet.
The bombs missed.

1250
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:02,983
The base wasn't hit. You better send
another air strike and fast.!

1251
01:22:03,084 --> 01:22:04,813
Wait one.

1252
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:13,461
Glendale?

1253
01:22:13,528 --> 01:22:17,396
The back-up strike of F-111 s
is being diverted to your target.

1254
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:21,162
- E. T.A. three minutes.
- Three minutes? What, are you crazy?

1255
01:22:21,236 --> 01:22:24,728
We don't have three minutes. In three
minutes we're gonna be shish kebabs!

1256
01:22:24,806 --> 01:22:27,104
We're under serious attack!

1257
01:22:27,208 --> 01:22:29,608
You'll have
to hold them.

1258
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:44,822
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my god.

1259
01:22:44,893 --> 01:22:48,420
You better get the planes here sooner.
The scuds are ready to fire.

1260
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:51,932
Two minutes
and 30 seconds.

1261
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:56,969
Hey. Hey!
Where's he goin'?

1262
01:23:03,378 --> 01:23:06,814
Hey! Hey!

1263
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:13,884
All right, my man!

1264
01:23:13,955 --> 01:23:17,186
You stay right here.
I gotta go.

1265
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:30,196
Hey, guys
move over!

1266
01:23:32,574 --> 01:23:35,099
"Cock firing mechanism. "

1267
01:23:35,210 --> 01:23:39,146
- Report the situation.
- Shut up.

1268
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:54,962
"Aim, set range if known
or estimate"?

1269
01:23:55,030 --> 01:23:57,430
- Who came up with these directions?
- I don't know.

1270
01:23:57,499 --> 01:24:01,629
Tell me to shut up one more time and I'm gonna
rip your spine out and use it for a putting iron!

1271
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:05,833
Shut up.
I'm not good with directions.

1272
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:09,171
"Push safety and hold down. "

1273
01:24:09,277 --> 01:24:11,302
Okay, everybody back!

1274
01:24:11,413 --> 01:24:13,881
"Fire by pushing trigger. "

1275
01:24:18,853 --> 01:24:21,515
Suck on this
a- one time!

1276
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:29,625
Oh. Sorry.

1277
01:24:34,302 --> 01:24:37,601
Last chance,
my friend.

1278
01:25:02,130 --> 01:25:04,257
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1279
01:25:04,332 --> 01:25:05,526
Whoo!

1280
01:25:10,538 --> 01:25:13,530
Oh, man!

1281
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,471
At my signal,
everybody scream like crazy.

1282
01:25:17,579 --> 01:25:21,276
Make 'em think we've got
50 guys up here, okay?

1283
01:25:21,349 --> 01:25:23,442
One and go!

1284
01:25:37,866 --> 01:25:40,027
We scared 'em!

1285
01:25:47,709 --> 01:25:51,475
Yeah, don't mess with
the Glendale Reservists!

1286
01:25:51,546 --> 01:25:54,208
Behind you.!

1287
01:25:54,282 --> 01:25:57,046
Two weeks a year,
one weekend a month.

1288

We're the few!
We're the proud!

1289
01:26:01,122 --> 01:26:05,024
We're the water boys!

1290
01:26:05,093 --> 01:26:07,618
- Bones, duck.!
- Get down.!

1291
01:26:58,012 --> 01:27:01,311
- Yeah, hey. All right, Stern.
- Thanks.

1292
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:03,680
Not bad for a bunch
of water boys, huh?

1293
01:27:03,751 --> 01:27:07,812
No! Soldiers!
I'm proud of you guys.

1294

1295

You oughta be... damn
pleased with yourselves!

1296

Congratulations.
You did an outstanding job.

1297
01:27:23,004 --> 01:27:26,599
It wasn't a job, First Sergeant.
It was an adventure.

1298
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:49,188
Hey! Hey!

1299
01:27:58,606 --> 01:28:02,042
- You're gonna have to go get a blood test, Bones.
- What?
