1
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:03,189
#Oh my life #

2
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:07,359
#Is changing every day #

3
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,597
#In every possible way #

4
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:18,505
#And oh, my dreams #

5
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,481
#It's never quite
as it seems #

6
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:25,814
#Never quite
as it seems #

7
00:01:28,922 --> 00:01:32,688
#I know I've felt
like this before #

8
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:37,128
#But now I'm feeling it
even more #

9
00:01:37,163 --> 00:01:40,132
#Because it came
from you #

10
00:01:43,736 --> 00:01:47,433
#Then I open up and see #

11
00:01:47,474 --> 00:01:51,911
#The person falling
here is me #

12
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:55,312
#A different way to be #

13
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:18,330
#I want more... #

14
00:02:18,371 --> 00:02:21,169
- Hey, Avram.
- Hi!

15
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:22,970
Excuse me, ladies.
Excuse me.

16
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:24,840
Thank you so much.

17
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,903
- My wife paid you, right?
- Yeah yeah.

18
00:02:26,946 --> 00:02:28,379
- Good.
- Have a good weekend.

19
00:02:28,414 --> 00:02:30,780
- You bet. Ciao.
- Ciao. Ciao.

20
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,308
#And they'll come true #

21
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:37,153
#lmpossible not to do #

22
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,250
#lmpossible not to do #

23
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,490
#And now
I tell you openly... #

24
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,124
Maida! Maida!

25
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:50,830
I'm picking up Slavko now,
could be a bit late.

26
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,395
Don't worry.
I'm going with Amela and the girls.

27
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:55,907
- I'll see you there.
- Ciao!

28
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,467
Hey, did you put
the beers in the car?

29
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,446
Yes, your beers
are safe!

30
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:05,007
Oh Bruno,
I'm sorry!

31
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:07,110
It's okay. It's okay.
How is business?

32
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,849
Good!
Yeah, it's very good.

33
00:03:14,327 --> 00:03:17,922
#Oh my life #

34
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:21,866
#Is changing every day #

35
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,734
#In every possible way #

36
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:33,044
#And oh, my dreams #

37
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:36,412
#It's never
quite as it seems #

38
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:39,509
#'Cause you're
a dream to me #

39
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:41,713
#Dream to me. #

40
00:03:47,594 --> 00:03:49,186
It's all there.

41
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,130
I'm sure it is, Emir,
but I'll just count it.

42
00:03:56,035 --> 00:03:59,471
Okay, see you
next week.

43
00:04:00,473 --> 00:04:03,169
Mr. Selimovic,
good morning.

44
00:04:08,715 --> 00:04:11,115
I told him he should go
to the police.

45
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:14,244
Yes, and end up paying them
more than I pay Zijah.

46
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:15,879
He never listens.

47
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:19,449
- Your tickets.
- You boys should be out there

48
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,722
competing in Barcelona.

49
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,888
No Yugoslavia,
no team.

50
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,989
I just want
to be at the Olympics.

51
00:04:26,032 --> 00:04:29,331
Mr., Mrs. And Miss
Selimovic.

52
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,894
Slavko Stanic and...

53
00:04:31,938 --> 00:04:35,601
- still doesn't know who he's taking?
- Slavko?

54
00:04:35,642 --> 00:04:38,372
He doesn't know what he's
doing in three hours' time,

55
00:04:38,411 --> 00:04:39,673
never mind three months!

56
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:41,680
Thanks.
Ciao, Natasha.

57
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,512
- Ciao.
- Have a good weekend. Yeah, ciao.

58
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:54,123
Where is it?
Here?

59
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:58,022
No!

60
00:04:58,064 --> 00:05:00,828
Hey, look!
It's here.

61
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,830
- Hey, Vlado!
- Slavko!

62
00:05:06,873 --> 00:05:08,841
You make me
late, huh?

63
00:05:13,379 --> 00:05:15,904
Barcelona!

64
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,787
- Now the weekend begins.
- Yeah.

65
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:23,618
We're gonna
have a great time.

66
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,510
- We should have got that watermelon.
- I told you.

67
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,312
No, I think that's my cue
to call it a day.

68
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,512
Just can't seem
to keep my hands still.

69
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:56,647
I hope your patients
don't hear you say that!

70
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:00,523
Okay, back
another 25 meters?

71
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,619
- Are you kidding?
- Yeah, come on!

72
00:06:02,662 --> 00:06:05,096
- Miso!
- No!

73
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:07,326
So have
some bread.

74
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,200
- Stop it!
- What's happening up there?

75
00:06:10,236 --> 00:06:11,726
They're
shooting olives.

76
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,075
Back here.
22, 23...

77
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:19,010
- You need some beer.
- Mm-mm.

78
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,605
No, I mean,
come on.

79
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,451
You got it.

80
00:07:09,495 --> 00:07:11,986
- For you.
- Thanks.

81
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:30,240
- Nadja!
- Hey, Lejla! Amela!

82
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,342
- Maida, come on!
- Amela!

83
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:34,376
- I'm here!
- Come! Food.

84
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,150
That's too much for you?
Come, sit.

85
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,919
Eat, eat.

86
00:07:41,694 --> 00:07:44,128
What?

87
00:07:44,163 --> 00:07:46,358
Okay,
so I see you later.

88
00:07:48,668 --> 00:07:50,533
What do you
think of her?

89
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,767
- She's coming to Barcelona with me.
- That's six you've got coming.

90
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:56,604
Is it six?

91
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:59,509
- Mama, do I have to eat the potatoes?
- Yes.

92
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:09,780
Slavko, if you're looking for someone
to take to the Olympics...

93
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:15,385
Vlado, that's not nice.

94
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,827
Why don't you ask Natasha
if she wants to go with you?

95
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:24,063
You know, the girl
from the travel agency?

96
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:26,162
Natasha!

97
00:08:26,205 --> 00:08:28,537
Come on, I'm not
looking for a wife!

98
00:08:28,574 --> 00:08:32,032
- Ah, she's a nice girl.
- That's what I mean.

99
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,173
Natasha!

100
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,582
What's going on here?

101
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:41,917
- I don't know.
- What are they doing?

102
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:49,227
- What's going on?
- You must show me your papers.

103
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,560
I don't have
to show you anything.

104
00:08:51,597 --> 00:08:54,589
You're now in the Serbian Republic
of Bosnia. Your papers!

105
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,397
Since when?

106
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,835
It was declared by Radovan
Karadzic this morning.

107
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:01,806
Don't be ridiculous.
Karadzic has nothing to do with us.

108
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:04,776
- Drive on.
- I must see your I.D.

109
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:08,211
- Your nationality?
- Yugoslavian.

110
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,772
Good night.

111
00:09:12,618 --> 00:09:13,744
Idiots.

112
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:19,554
I can't believe these soldiers.
What do they think they're doing?

113
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:24,828
Get out!
Get out of the car.

114
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,991
It's okay, I'll deal with it.
Give me that thousand.

115
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,230
- You're not giving him money.
- Just let him deal with it.

116
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:35,032
Slavko Stanic,
Serbian from Banja Luka,

117
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:37,736
now living in Sarajevo.
These are friends of mine.

118
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:39,870
- They're just taking me home.
- I see.

119
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:50,349
I was going to buy some
of Napoleon's best Cognac

120
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:52,721
to celebrate the news.

121
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:55,386
- Why don't you celebrate with me?
- I think I will.

122
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,658
- Okay, take care. Bye.
- You too.

123
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:02,158
Okay, let's go.

124
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,941
Pow!

125
00:10:13,145 --> 00:10:14,908
Vlado...

126
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:18,542
what if Maida and Amela had been traveling
back on their own?

127
00:10:18,584 --> 00:10:22,418
I mean, with me, okay,
I have my Serbian I.D.,

128
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:25,322
but two Muslim women
on their own with the kids,

129
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,588
- it's worrying.
- They'll be gone in the morning.

130
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:30,221
The U.N. Can't allow
that to go on.

131
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,753
Eh, I hope
you're right.

132
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:34,527
Good night,
sweetheart.

133
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:36,091
- Good night.
- Sleep well.

134
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,831
Are you sure you've got everything
for school tomorrow?

135
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,135
- Yes, Mom.
- All right.

136
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:43,004
- Good night.
- Don't stay up all night.

137
00:10:43,042 --> 00:10:44,475
- I won't.
- Night.

138
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:47,946
- Be a good girl, Lejla.
- Thank you for the weekend.

139
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,743
- It's a pleasure. Ciao!
- Night!

140
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:53,309
I have to put it first of all
in this hand, okay?

141
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,684
But... it's gone!

142
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:58,554
- Oh...
- Wait a minute, where is it?

143
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,458
- Oh it's here!
- No, it's too fast!

144
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,554
Come on, music off,
lights out.

145
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,289
- Bye. Good night.
- Sweet dreams!

146
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:11,326
And no talking
late, okay?

147
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,997
I'm going to bed.

148
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:21,011
- See you later.
- Good night, Slavko.

149
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:22,810
Good night, Maida.

150
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,783
Ah, for me?

151
00:11:59,618 --> 00:12:00,949
Wow.

152
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:05,218
I had them all stuffed in a drawer,
so I thought...

153
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,092
Where shall I hang it?

154
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:39,954
- So young.
- Mm-mm.

155
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:08,015
- That was Budapest, right?
- Yes.

156
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,079
600 meters.
Good shooting.

157
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,990
I knew you'd have
to include that one.

158
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,893
So why now?

159
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:29,131
I just wanted you
to have it.

160
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,145
- Let's drink.
- Yeah.

161
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:44,907
When Bosnia's parliament
voted for independence

162
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:48,147
from Yugoslavia, Bosnian Serb
leader Radovan Karadzic

163
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,246
warned of
violent consequences.

164
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,991
Now Bosnia is independent
and there's growing concern

165
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,591
that violence, even open war,
could erupt,

166
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:04,262
fueled by old ethnic hatreds
that are again emerging

167
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:06,965
as Yugoslavia
disintegrates.

168
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,977
In Sarajevo, many believed
peace would prevail.

169
00:15:14,013 --> 00:15:16,982
Muslims, Croats and Serbs
have lived comfortably together

170
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,075
in the Bosnian
capital for decades,

171
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:21,109
forging friendships
and intermarrying.

172
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,144
But the mountains
that ring Sarajevo,

173
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:25,850
where the winter Olympics
were held just eight years ago,

174
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:29,418
are now controlled by Bosnian-Serb
militias with heavy weapons.

175
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,157
One kilometer or a kilometer
and a half from Sarajevo.

176
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:34,358
But we don't shoot.

177
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,561
We try just to keep peace

178
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:41,539
and not to... to control
the surroundings of Sarajevo.

179
00:15:41,573 --> 00:15:43,734
You could take Sarajevo
tomorrow, couldn't you?

180
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,439
Anytime.
We could take it anytime.

181
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:53,081
Lejla, what are you
doing in there?

182
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,143
Bosnian-Serb politicians
still talk peace

183
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,678
and they're denying a report
that Muslims and Croats

184
00:15:57,723 --> 00:16:00,351
are now being forced at gunpoint
to leave their villages.

185
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:03,759
- I'm trying to find my book.
- Can't achieve anything by war.

186
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,197
We don't want to take
the others' villages

187
00:16:07,232 --> 00:16:11,225
or the other towns
or to impose any revolution.

188
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:15,536
We just want to be free,
to be as independent as the others.

189
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:19,169
But many Sarajevans don't
believe Karadzic wants peace.

190
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,941
Fearing the worst,
they're abandoning their city.

191
00:16:24,183 --> 00:16:26,242
- Found my book, Dad.
- Hmm?

192
00:16:26,285 --> 00:16:28,913
- Found my book.
- Good.

193
00:16:28,954 --> 00:16:31,445
You had it!
Ready?

194
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,518
- Bye, Mama.
- Thank you for having me.

195
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:37,358
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye, Lejla.

196
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:39,660
Stay whenever you want.

197
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:42,690
- Bye!
- Bye!

198
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:49,040
40, 50, 60.
Okay.

199
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:54,436
Come on.

200
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:02,320
That'll be
17 Deutsche marks.

201
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:17,398
- Do you think we should be leaving?
- I don't know.

202
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:21,099
I mean, I can't
leave the hospital,

203
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:24,303
but maybe I should be getting
Amela and Lejla away.

204
00:17:28,113 --> 00:17:29,478
See you later.

205
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:40,788
I'm sure that a lot of what is happening
is because people are getting

206
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:44,523
on the bandwagon and creating chaos
just to make an easy buck.

207
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:46,997
And it's our fear
that they're living off!

208
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,193
I think it's important
to let them know

209
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:51,759
that we will not be
frightened out of our homes.

210
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,863
Yes, I know...

211
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,841
but it's not that,
Mr. Selimovic.

212
00:17:56,875 --> 00:18:00,242
My boyfriend's Serbian and
he's been called up into the army.

213
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:02,747
That's why we're
going to leave.

214
00:18:02,781 --> 00:18:06,376
- I see.
- He doesn't want to fight.

215
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,080
No, I can understand that.

216
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:15,620
- I'll keep your job for you.
- Thank you.

217
00:18:15,661 --> 00:18:16,650
Of course.

218
00:18:23,168 --> 00:18:24,795
My car.

219
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:31,103
Hey!

220
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,993
Abandon your homes
or be murdered.

221
00:18:50,028 --> 00:18:52,929
What can I do?
Who can I report it to?

222
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:55,729
Nobody's interested!

223
00:18:55,767 --> 00:18:57,758
In Zvornik,
people are fleeing

224
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,771
with only the clothes
they're wearing.

225
00:18:59,805 --> 00:19:03,366
There are reports of young men
being murdered or taken hostage.

226
00:19:03,408 --> 00:19:06,775
- Panic is gripping Sarajevo.
- Look! It's Zijah!

227
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,474
Do you know how much
he's charging for one can of petrol?

228
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,380
200 Deutsche marks!

229
00:19:11,416 --> 00:19:14,874
...is to buy it from the gangs
that are running the black market

230
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,888
- that's suddenly developed.
- Hey.

231
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:18,947
- Hey, that's our car!
- It can't be.

232
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,960
It is, look! They're
selling our new car on TV.

233
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:25,930
- Hi.
- Would you believe it?

234
00:19:25,964 --> 00:19:29,400
For keeping your husband
up late last night, Maida.

235
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:31,698
That is outrageous.

236
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:34,069
That is outrageous!
I should have taped it.

237
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,038
What's happened?

238
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:37,667
Zijah! He stole my car
this morning.

239
00:19:37,709 --> 00:19:41,509
And he's just been selling it on TV, just
now! It's just been on!

240
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,573
Talking in a high voice
isn't going to bring it back.

241
00:19:44,616 --> 00:19:46,277
No point in having a car.

242
00:19:46,318 --> 00:19:48,445
They won't let anyone
through the roadblocks.

243
00:19:48,487 --> 00:19:52,014
- We got through last time, didn't we?
- It's different now.

244
00:19:57,329 --> 00:20:00,628
- Have you been called up?
- Yeah.

245
00:20:02,301 --> 00:20:05,099
So what are you
going to do about it?

246
00:20:05,137 --> 00:20:07,605
I go tomorrow.

247
00:20:10,008 --> 00:20:12,670
Why?

248
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,909
He's been called up.

249
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:19,810
You don't have to join
Karadzic's army.

250
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:23,309
There are plenty of Serbs who are
draft dodging. Miso isn't going.

251
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:25,323
Miso's a doctor.

252
00:20:25,357 --> 00:20:27,825
And I wouldn't want
Miso in my army.

253
00:20:27,859 --> 00:20:30,521
- What will you be doing?
- Cadet training.

254
00:20:30,562 --> 00:20:33,531
And if they start firing
those guns on the hillsides,

255
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:36,033
where are you
gonna be then?

256
00:20:36,068 --> 00:20:39,526
- Wherever they're not pointing at me.
- Firing them?

257
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,698
He said he's
cadet training.

258
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:45,471
- I have nothing to do with artillery.
- Perhaps you should have.

259
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:47,740
Then you could tell
your commanding officer

260
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:49,644
to take his tanks
off our hillsides.

261
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:53,811
I don't like guns pointing at me!
Some idiot might set one off!

262
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:49,871
You can't get sucked
into all this, Slavko.

263
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:54,345
Those guys calling themselves
generals are madmen.

264
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,347
They call me Muslim.

265
00:21:56,381 --> 00:21:58,349
They call you Serb.

266
00:21:58,383 --> 00:22:00,374
We're Yugoslav!

267
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,684
You have to get out.

268
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:06,691
What they got you doing?
Training kids to shoot on us?

269
00:22:06,725 --> 00:22:09,592
I can get you three
plane tickets out of the city.

270
00:22:09,628 --> 00:22:11,960
You're family to us.
You belong to Sarajevo,

271
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:15,364
not to those idiots in the hills
living out their stupid history books!

272
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:18,392
- How much?
- What?

273
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:21,133
For the tickets.
I can hear.

274
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:25,970
- 10,000 Deutsche marks.
- 10,000 Deutsche marks?

275
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,275
Where to,
New Zealand?

276
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:30,178
Vienna.

277
00:22:31,850 --> 00:22:34,216
10,000 Deutsche marks
for Vienna?

278
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:37,415
That's cheap.
People are paying twice that price.

279
00:22:37,456 --> 00:22:40,220
- How much are you getting out of it?
- Hey.

280
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,920
Maida, l...
I don't get anything.

281
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:45,794
I just want you
to get out of the city.

282
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:49,895
And what the hell
would we do in Vienna?

283
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:53,132
- Be refugees?
- No no no no no.

284
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:55,298
We are not
going to be refugees.

285
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:58,309
That is third world stuff!
This is Sarajevo, not Somalia!

286
00:22:58,343 --> 00:22:59,970
We're Europeans,
for God's sake!

287
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:03,003
You can go to Stockholm
and stay with Anders.

288
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:05,107
We can't arrive
on Ander's doorstep and say,

289
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,881
"Hi, we're refugees. We'd like to move into
your house for the next 20 years."

290
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:11,047
Vlado spent 15 years
building up his business.

291
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:14,388
And I have worked overtime
every week to live the live we do.

292
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:17,327
So nobody is going
to take it away from us now!

293
00:23:17,362 --> 00:23:20,331
The moment
we walk away,

294
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:21,992
we lose everything.

295
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,170
This is our home.

296
00:23:33,378 --> 00:23:35,369
I think you should leave.

297
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:47,548
I'm just trying
to warn you, Maida.

298
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:53,327
Listen to me.

299
00:23:53,365 --> 00:23:55,333
We don't get
our wage until...

300
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:58,666
unless we start fighting.

301
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,671
A lot of angry soldiers, Vlado.

302
00:24:00,705 --> 00:24:03,265
That's why you should
take those tickets.

303
00:24:03,308 --> 00:24:06,300
You may have everything
to lose, we have nothing to lose.

304
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,951
You know the most important
thing in the world to me

305
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,977
is that you, Maida
and Nadja are safe.

306
00:24:19,324 --> 00:24:21,315
Yeah.

307
00:24:32,337 --> 00:24:33,827
See you around.

308
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,596
Sarajevo is now cut off
from the rest of the world.

309
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,971
Encircled by Bosnian-Serb machine guns,
artillery and tanks.

310
00:25:43,008 --> 00:25:46,774
If they fire just one of those guns
up on the hillside,

311
00:25:46,811 --> 00:25:48,278
they will have destroyed
themselves.

312
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,781
It's just like what
happened in the Gulf.

313
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:54,182
The Americans will come...
pow! Straight at 'em.

314
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,846
But the only response

315
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:58,685
from the Bosnian-Serb
leadership today was silence.

316
00:26:17,475 --> 00:26:19,170
Nadja!

317
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,908
Nadja! You okay?

318
00:26:25,984 --> 00:26:30,011
- Mama!
- You're okay away from the windows.

319
00:26:31,022 --> 00:26:32,683
Come on!
Get our things.

320
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:38,819
Okay.

321
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,989
Shh-shh.

322
00:26:52,677 --> 00:26:54,668
Okay.

323
00:26:58,984 --> 00:27:00,576
- Come on, Nadja.
- No!

324
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,849
Hop on Daddy's back.

325
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:04,878
Maida!

326
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,525
They're stuck
in the elevator!

327
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:16,022
There's nothing we can do!
Come on! Come on!

328
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:30,812
Come on.

329
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,963
We should make a run
for Miso's.

330
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,476
- I don't want to go anywhere.
- We can't stay here.

331
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,478
Come on,
come on.

332
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:36,707
Let's go.

333
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:43,477
Stay close.

334
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:58,158
Go on.

335
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:18,048
Nadja!

336
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:22,824
Nadja!

337
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,840
- Leave it!
- What?

338
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:54,959
Nadja!

339
00:30:00,331 --> 00:30:02,322
Come inside!

340
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:06,929
Go on.

341
00:30:08,339 --> 00:30:09,465
Hey, listen.

342
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:14,478
They're going to frighten us
out of our homes, aren't they?

343
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:16,810
That's what they're doing.

344
00:30:31,529 --> 00:30:33,827
Who are you calling?

345
00:30:33,865 --> 00:30:36,333
Slavko.

346
00:30:36,367 --> 00:30:38,858
I need to find out
about those tickets.

347
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:40,871
I think
I should do that.

348
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,668
Lejla?

349
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,902
Never ever go out
on your own again.

350
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:48,743
Make sure either me
or your dad are with you.

351
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,408
- Do you hear?
- That goes for you, Nadja.

352
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,114
Not until
those tanks are gone.

353
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,147
And don't ever
use the elevator.

354
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:02,022
Here, try this on.

355
00:31:07,765 --> 00:31:09,255
The lines are down.

356
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:24,971
From their dominant positions
on the hills rising

357
00:32:25,009 --> 00:32:27,876
above Sarajevo, Bosnian-Serb
gunners can precisely target

358
00:32:27,912 --> 00:32:30,813
most of the streets
and buildings in the city.

359
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,976
Snipers are now operating
from positions along the front lines,

360
00:32:34,018 --> 00:32:36,009
shooting anyone
in their sights.

361
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:39,383
And for the people
of Sarajevo,

362
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:42,882
there is no escape from a city
that's become a shooting gallery.

363
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:47,557
The roads out are closed and the airport
is held by Bosnian-Serb forces.

364
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,327
They overran it yesterday

365
00:32:49,367 --> 00:32:51,835
using tanks to crush
any opposition.

366
00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,337
Now Sarajevans
must either surrender their city

367
00:32:54,372 --> 00:32:56,067
or try to defend it.

368
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:13,050
Okay.

369
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:23,361
What's he doing now?

370
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:26,393
If you want to control
the black market, start an army.

371
00:33:26,437 --> 00:33:27,734
That's what he's doing.

372
00:33:30,308 --> 00:33:33,038
Zijah's militia...

373
00:33:33,077 --> 00:33:35,307
opportunistic mother...

374
00:33:35,346 --> 00:33:39,305
This is the magazine.
This is how... where you load it.

375
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:43,147
Then you get
ready to shoot.

376
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:47,555
Put the safety...
always be careful.

377
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:51,119
Dear Lejla, my best friend
ever in the whole world.

378
00:33:51,162 --> 00:33:54,359
This is my first report to you
from the front line.

379
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:56,867
The electricity and water
are still off,

380
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,392
but Dad has found some
useless plastic stuff

381
00:33:59,437 --> 00:34:00,961
to put across the windows.

382
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,873
Old Teddy has got
a cut on his nose,

383
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:07,309
but otherwise,
the Selimovic family is just fine.

384
00:34:07,345 --> 00:34:09,836
Where are you sleeping?

385
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,940
I'm not allowed
in my bed anymore...

386
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,679
and Dad says we're not
going down to the basement

387
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,187
because he thinks
we'll be safer where we are.

388
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,451
Great! Let's hope he's right
or we're dead!

389
00:34:27,865 --> 00:34:29,856
I'm sorry!

390
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:35,532
- Where are you going?
- Get an ambulance, quick!

391
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,803
Young Malik's out there
with a rifle.

392
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,143
He doesn't have
a chance.

393
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:48,417
Nadja, come away.

394
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,421
Malik, no time
for mistakes.

395
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:00,758
Like that.

396
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:05,192
You're going to be
on the front line at Dobrinja...

397
00:35:05,236 --> 00:35:06,669
Chetniks shooting at you.

398
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,948
That should do it.

399
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:35,731
I'll be all right,
darling. I will.

400
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:38,098
I'll be back, okay?

401
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:41,400
Come here.

402
00:36:03,761 --> 00:36:06,491
Hey hey! Over here!
First house!

403
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,802
- Vlado!
- Nebojsa!

404
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,667
- Good luck!
- Thanks!

405
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:38,018
Everyone's in.

406
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:45,963
Okay...

407
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:51,540
the Serbs are
way back.

408
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:56,608
Back here,
no problem.

409
00:36:56,647 --> 00:36:59,707
So, Avram, Samir,
Malik and Dusko...

410
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,183
Nevinova Street.

411
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,230
Malik...

412
00:39:04,475 --> 00:39:07,273
Malik, come on!

413
00:39:07,311 --> 00:39:08,710
Forward,
for God's sake!

414
00:39:13,751 --> 00:39:16,686
Malik, get forward,
you idiot!

415
00:39:16,721 --> 00:39:18,848
You have to get
forward into the house!

416
00:39:24,061 --> 00:39:25,528
Malik!

417
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:48,776
Vlado, get the kid
to the house!

418
00:40:53,417 --> 00:40:56,250
Sarajevo's suburbs
have become battlegrounds.

419
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,881
Civilians are being
caught in the crossfire.

420
00:40:58,923 --> 00:41:02,381
Here in Dobrinja, the fighting
is particularly vicious.

421
00:41:02,426 --> 00:41:06,328
It's a predominantly Muslim district next to
the Serb-controlled airport.

422
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:08,729
Its streets are now
a killing zone.

423
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:12,600
Nine of the 25 men in just
one unit defending Dobrinja

424
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:15,070
have died in
the last few days.

425
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,437
One of the many tragedies
of this conflict...

426
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,204
Home leave.

427
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:22,406
People who were once friends
are killing each other

428
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:25,210
and the international community
appears powerless.

429
00:41:47,471 --> 00:41:49,496
- Nadja.
- Thank you.

430
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:10,091
- Hello?
- Vlado, how are you?

431
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,459
Slavko!

432
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:15,488
- I tried calling you!
- How are Maida and Nadja?

433
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,660
Yeah, they're here.
They're fine.

434
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:19,862
Good.
I'm really glad to hear that.

435
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,734
Where are you?

436
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,766
Well out of it.

437
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,505
Where?

438
00:42:31,148 --> 00:42:33,616
I told you you should
take those tickets.

439
00:42:33,651 --> 00:42:36,119
Yeah... yeah, you were right.

440
00:42:37,555 --> 00:42:39,079
I can still
get you out.

441
00:42:41,625 --> 00:42:43,616
It may be your last
chance, Vlado.

442
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:45,390
You've got
to take it this time.

443
00:42:45,429 --> 00:42:48,125
- Go on.
- Go and see Natasha.

444
00:42:48,165 --> 00:42:51,862
- You know, from the travel agency?
- Yeah, of course I know her.

445
00:42:51,902 --> 00:42:54,063
I've given her details
of a route you can take

446
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:57,073
and a special pass to get you
through the checkpoint.

447
00:42:57,107 --> 00:42:59,974
It's totally safe,
but you have to go today.

448
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:03,138
Vasa Slava Street,
"C" Block, 340.

449
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:05,512
You've got that?
340 Vasa Slava Street.

450
00:43:05,549 --> 00:43:07,949
Lieutenant Stanic, sir.

451
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,886
Okay. For God's sake,
Vlado, you go this time!

452
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:13,685
Okay, okay, I'll come.
Promise me now.

453
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:15,157
You get the hell
out of there!

454
00:43:34,144 --> 00:43:36,135
You should take
Nadja and go.

455
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:43,516
On our own?

456
00:43:43,554 --> 00:43:47,115
I can't leave now.
I'm needed here.

457
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:50,024
Cross the mountains
on our own?

458
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,223
- What if it's a trap?
- He wouldn't do that to us!

459
00:43:53,263 --> 00:43:55,231
He wants you
to be safe!

460
00:43:57,434 --> 00:43:59,902
- I'm not going anywhere without you.
- No.

461
00:43:59,937 --> 00:44:01,802
I won't go anywhere
without Lejla.

462
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,303
We stay together, Vlado.

463
00:44:35,973 --> 00:44:38,339
Okay, let's see
what we have.

464
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:47,145
Good shooting.
Mm-hmm.

465
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:50,851
Good.

466
00:45:06,737 --> 00:45:10,639
What are you trying to do,
shoot his thing off?

467
00:45:12,142 --> 00:45:14,042
Come here,
I'll show you.

468
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:19,445
Okay, you are now
trained snipers.

469
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:23,783
Tomorrow, you'll be going
to the front line in Sarajevo...

470
00:45:23,821 --> 00:45:28,053
- One, two and out.
...to the districts of Grbavica,

471
00:45:28,092 --> 00:45:32,586
Dobrinja, Nedzarici,
Alipasino Polje.

472
00:45:34,465 --> 00:45:36,262
Men, women, children...

473
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:39,463
You keep a little breath inside you
to keep you still,

474
00:45:39,503 --> 00:45:41,903
and then you will become one
with your target.

475
00:45:41,939 --> 00:45:44,669
You see a target,
you fire.

476
00:45:44,708 --> 00:45:47,643
Your job is
to terrorize, okay?

477
00:45:48,979 --> 00:45:51,140
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir!

478
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:59,611
I'd rather my team didn't shoot
in Alipasino Polje.

479
00:45:59,656 --> 00:46:03,319
Why, you have
friends there?

480
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:05,851
We all have
friends there.

481
00:46:05,896 --> 00:46:07,921
But we are Serbs.

482
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:09,899
You're fighting
for our families.

483
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:12,731
You are shooting for everything
and everyone we have lost,

484
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,931
for all our suffering.

485
00:46:14,972 --> 00:46:18,066
Meet Slavko Stanic,
the best shooter in Yugoslavia!

486
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,975
Tomorrow, his boys will show us
what they can do in Sarajevo.

487
00:46:26,683 --> 00:46:29,413
- Hi!
- Happy birthday!

488
00:46:29,453 --> 00:46:31,887
- Happy birthday!
- Chocolate!

489
00:46:34,491 --> 00:46:38,052
- Good to see you.
- So how does it feel to be a teenager?

490
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:40,859
She hates being older.

491
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,160
- Hello!
- Come on in!

492
00:46:42,199 --> 00:46:44,190
Okay...

493
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:48,033
Oh look,
this is great!

494
00:46:48,071 --> 00:46:51,302
- You guys want beer?
- Fantastic!

495
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:53,172
- You guys want beer?
- Sure.

496
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:01,409
Nadja, can you put this on the piano,
please? Thank you.

497
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,887
- Where did you get all this stuff?
- Don't ask.

498
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:08,255
How much did it cost,
that's the question.

499
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:11,955
- You have to celebrate a birthday.
- Our pièce de résistance.

500
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,759
- Pizza!
- Oh thank you!

501
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:18,427
One with tuna,
and one pepperoni special.

502
00:47:18,468 --> 00:47:21,995
- Look at that, Lejla!
- Maida, you want beer?

503
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:27,638
- Eat, everybody!
- Yeah, come on! Go for it!

504
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,238
- So...
- What?

505
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,248
Have you heard
from Slavko?

506
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,250
- Yeah, he called.
- Yeah?

507
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:37,742
In fact, he offered us
an escape route.

508
00:47:40,157 --> 00:47:43,388
Escape route?
What sort of escape route?

509
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,720
Yeah, a route
out of the cities.

510
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:49,231
Said he had some friends
on a checkpoint. Nadja.

511
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:50,699
- Thank you, Dad.
- So...

512
00:47:50,734 --> 00:47:52,861
- when are you going?
- Piece of pizza for you.

513
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:56,865
No no, we didn't take it.
It was just for that day.

514
00:47:59,109 --> 00:48:01,669
Are you crazy?

515
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,577
Why the hell not?

516
00:48:03,614 --> 00:48:06,014
We have dying people

517
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:09,143
dumped in the corridors
of the hospital every day

518
00:48:09,186 --> 00:48:12,417
and we can't treat them!
This is only the beginning!

519
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:16,622
Vlado did tell us
we should leave.

520
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:19,561
It was me who said no.
I wanted us to stay together.

521
00:48:19,596 --> 00:48:23,032
Of course you did. Vlado should
have said, "Thank you, but go!"

522
00:48:24,701 --> 00:48:28,102
For God's sake, Vlado,
we're talking about survival here!

523
00:48:28,138 --> 00:48:31,505
If anything happens
to any of us...

524
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:34,305
- you know what I'm talking about.
- The children...

525
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,438
- Nothing matters more than survival.
- You want to survive?

526
00:48:37,481 --> 00:48:39,073
You have to fight for it.

527
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,812
That's why I have to stay.

528
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:48,723
Sure, but Nadja doesn't,
Maida doesn't.

529
00:48:48,759 --> 00:48:52,160
What reason on earth could
there be for keeping them here?!

530
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:58,163
You could have
taken my car.

531
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:00,829
You could have taken
Amela and Lejla with you.

532
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:05,764
I would give anything
to get them out! Anything!

533
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:16,483
I'm sorry.

534
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:44,880
Let's cheer
to the birthday girl.

535
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,746
Thank you.

536
00:49:51,788 --> 00:49:54,382
Cheers!

537
00:50:18,882 --> 00:50:23,046
Hey, how much does it cost,
an hour for a woman?

538
00:50:23,086 --> 00:50:26,078
My friend's getting
desperate over here.

539
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:28,421
100 Deutsche marks.

540
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:30,892
Then tell your sister
I owe her 50!

541
00:50:30,927 --> 00:50:35,330
You maniac!
What are you trying to do, kill me?

542
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:41,764
Hello, best friend ever.

543
00:50:41,805 --> 00:50:43,136
Me again.

544
00:50:43,173 --> 00:50:45,266
I spend half my life
waiting for a mother

545
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:49,506
- and here I am, waiting for her again.
- Come on, let's go.

546
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,678
Go on.

547
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,651
- We'll go by the market, okay?
- Okay.

548
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,317
Here, take this.

549
00:51:07,264 --> 00:51:10,495
- Wait for me, Lejla.
- Come on now.

550
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:12,866
- Can we stop by Nadja's on the way?
- No.

551
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,734
I want to come
back and do the laundry.

552
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:16,033
I want to give her the tape.

553
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:18,871
Have the batteries not run out
on that thing yet?

554
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:23,807
- Where are the wheels?
- Oh, Jeez, I've forgotten them.

555
00:51:23,847 --> 00:51:27,248
Would you go back and...
it doesn't matter. I'll get them.

556
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:31,846
- You wait here.
- Yes.

557
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:41,163
Okay.

558
00:51:41,198 --> 00:51:43,189
Oh come on,
where is it?

559
00:51:44,301 --> 00:51:46,360
Lejla, have you
seen the cart?

560
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:49,099
- No, Mom.
- You had it last.

561
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:53,506
Okay, where's this...

562
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:59,172
Hello, best friend ever.

563
00:51:59,216 --> 00:52:03,175
As I was saying, I spend half my life
waiting for my mother,

564
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,415
and here I am,
waiting for her again.

565
00:52:05,455 --> 00:52:08,219
I was going
to use this tape...

566
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:11,193
I'm not going insane.
I'm fine.

567
00:52:15,031 --> 00:52:16,999
There we go.

568
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,011
Lejla.

569
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:37,781
Come on, Lejla, it's not funny.
Lejla, come on.

570
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:40,255
Let's go.
Come on.

571
00:52:40,290 --> 00:52:41,655
Lejla.

572
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,560
Lejla?

573
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:50,899
Lejla!

574
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:52,799
Come on, Lejla!

575
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,635
No no, Lejla!

576
00:52:58,074 --> 00:53:00,804
No, God, no.
Please, God, no!

577
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:08,781
Lejla!

578
00:53:18,128 --> 00:53:20,756
No! No, please,
God, no!

579
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,731
No!

580
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:24,256
- Get her inside.
- No! No!

581
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:00,893
Okay.

582
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:03,804
- We must call Miso.
- He's at the hospital.

583
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:07,537
- I'll call him for you.
- No, I don't want him to know.

584
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,977
- You have to, Amela.
- No!

585
00:54:10,013 --> 00:54:12,641
There's a sniper in the empty
building at the far end.

586
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:15,913
That's what's happened.
They must have taken the building.

587
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,977
She'll be all right.

588
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:20,455
She's going to be
all right.

589
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,642
Vlado.

590
00:54:45,715 --> 00:54:47,444
Get back!
Get back!

591
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:18,538
Maida's just called me.

592
00:55:19,983 --> 00:55:22,611
Will you please
get out of here?

593
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:31,718
Yeah.

594
00:55:31,761 --> 00:55:36,323
- Oh, Miso, I'm so sorry.
- Just get out of here.

595
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,568
I don't ever want
to see you again.

596
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:10,691
They can't bury her
at the cemetery.

597
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:15,228
Why not?

598
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:18,498
It's full.

599
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:22,940
And no one will go to Bara
because of the snipers.

600
00:57:10,894 --> 00:57:13,362
Hello, best friend ever...

601
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:15,762
I'm not staying here
to see my daughter murdered.

602
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,835
Where are you going?

603
00:57:19,869 --> 00:57:21,860
Across the city.

604
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,738
An apartment in Kosovo.

605
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:28,232
It belongs to a couple who've left, so we
can use it until the end of the war.

606
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,179
Hello, best friend ever.
It's me again...

607
00:57:31,214 --> 00:57:33,842
Miso got it
for Amela and Lejla,

608
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:36,044
but now Amela wants
to be near the grave.

609
00:57:36,085 --> 00:57:38,553
He found it for them
the morning she was shot.

610
00:57:38,588 --> 00:57:40,749
Why do you tell me that?

611
00:57:40,790 --> 00:57:43,020
I'm just telling you
that he's managed to...

612
00:57:43,059 --> 00:57:45,857
No, you're not! Will you stop
playing that freaking tape?!

613
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:47,658
She'll play it
if she wants to!

614
00:57:48,731 --> 00:57:52,326
You're only telling me that because that's
what I should have done.

615
00:57:52,368 --> 00:57:54,859
No, I'm not.
He heard about it...

616
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:57,668
And he! He's only doing this
now to show me up!

617
00:57:57,707 --> 00:58:00,073
Do you think showing
you up is on his mind

618
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:03,078
the day he's buried his daughter?
Every time, you get it wrong!

619
00:58:03,112 --> 00:58:04,374
Oh, what do I get wrong?

620
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:06,780
Miso understood
the situation all along,

621
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,444
from the beginning and you never did!
You were blind!

622
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,455
And who told you to take that route out
when Slavko phoned?

623
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:15,287
- It was too late by then!
- Miso didn't think so.

624
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:18,260
How could I leave you
when you are on the front line?

625
00:58:18,294 --> 00:58:21,786
- You're leaving me now!
- If you can't see why I'm going now...

626
00:58:21,831 --> 00:58:24,026
No, I do.
Go on, do it. Shove off.

627
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:26,228
Yes, I will!

628
00:58:26,269 --> 00:58:29,602
What a good man
he is, huh?

629
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:33,268
What humility on the day
he's burying his own daughter

630
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:35,277
to think of you
and Nadja.

631
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:38,508
- Yes, he is a good man.
- I mean it!

632
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:43,307
How the hell can he
still be a good man?!

633
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,462
Go away.

634
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,971
- Nadja...
- Go away!

635
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:07,670
Leave me alone!

636
01:01:59,982 --> 01:02:02,143
Hey!

637
01:02:03,152 --> 01:02:04,585
Help!

638
01:02:54,237 --> 01:02:57,604
How are your boys doing
in Sarajevo?

639
01:02:57,640 --> 01:02:59,608
They're okay.

640
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:01,405
You got to keep
an eye on them.

641
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,641
Don't worry,
I'll keep them sharp.

642
01:03:04,680 --> 01:03:06,739
This is easy.

643
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:10,617
We can bomb every
Muslim's house in Bosnia.

644
01:03:10,653 --> 01:03:14,384
But there'll be no Serbia,
unless we take Sarajevo.

645
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:20,158
So, which house you want?

646
01:03:20,196 --> 01:03:22,721
Pick any house.
We'll save one for you.

647
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:24,562
Hah.

648
01:03:25,768 --> 01:03:28,362
Hey hey,
stop stop, back!

649
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:30,463
Back up.

650
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:51,059
Say goodbye.

651
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:26,051
What happened to my family
was 10 times worse than this.

652
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,893
Get them out of here.

653
01:04:51,020 --> 01:04:53,580
To all our families.

654
01:05:01,631 --> 01:05:04,657
- I'll take this house.
- Of course.

655
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:24,614
Okay, we leave this house.
Let's go.

656
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:04,383
We have poor snipers.

657
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:08,830
- They are targeting the apartment on...
- What are you telling me for?

658
01:06:08,864 --> 01:06:10,923
To do something about it.

659
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:14,403
Why?
Are your sales going down?

660
01:06:14,437 --> 01:06:15,836
Everybody in the estate

661
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:18,806
has to use the streets
some times during the week.

662
01:06:20,343 --> 01:06:24,109
And all the victims are people
going to the water truck.

663
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:37,592
Is this it?

664
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:39,787
Okay.

665
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,888
What else do you need?

666
01:07:01,484 --> 01:07:03,975
There's no one shooting at us
from inside the estate.

667
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:10,751
They've got to be
in those buildings over there.

668
01:07:20,970 --> 01:07:23,029
You're looking
for anything...

669
01:07:24,106 --> 01:07:27,098
any change
in light or shadow...

670
01:07:27,143 --> 01:07:30,169
cigarettes smoke,
anything.

671
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:33,114
Okay.

672
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:38,452
They've got
to be there somewhere.

673
01:08:15,091 --> 01:08:16,786
Help!

674
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:33,835
Nothing.

675
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:50,325
Get forward!

676
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:02,398
Sofia!

677
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:05,930
Stop!

678
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,368
You stay here.

679
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:35,496
She's moving.

680
01:09:45,214 --> 01:09:47,944
Dino, bring that car
over here.

681
01:10:03,566 --> 01:10:06,126
You have to be seeing
at least one of them.

682
01:10:06,168 --> 01:10:09,035
We're not seeing anything.

683
01:10:09,071 --> 01:10:12,131
Get them into the car.

684
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:21,378
You find these
murderers, Vlado.

685
01:11:15,571 --> 01:11:18,768
- Do you know where Dr. Kovacevic is?
- I really don't know, sir.

686
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:38,620
Miso.

687
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:44,389
Okay.

688
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:50,566
I need your help.

689
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:52,437
The bodies of two women
shot in the head

690
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:55,966
in Alipasino Polje were
brought in this afternoon.

691
01:11:56,011 --> 01:12:00,311
- Can you give me an autopsy?
- Give you an autopsy?

692
01:12:00,349 --> 01:12:03,045
Who do you think you are?

693
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:05,610
I need to find out
from where they were shot.

694
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:08,179
You think we have time
for autopsies?

695
01:12:08,223 --> 01:12:10,885
Miso, please,
any information, anything.

696
01:12:10,926 --> 01:12:14,259
Look, I'm doing
what I can.

697
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:17,754
You have to wait in reception
like everyone else.

698
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:31,135
Malik!

699
01:12:31,180 --> 01:12:33,045
How are you?

700
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:35,707
Vlado, hi.

701
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:37,946
I am okay.

702
01:12:42,124 --> 01:12:43,591
Thanks.

703
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:46,727
Girl, 13!

704
01:12:58,340 --> 01:13:02,470
Mr. Selimovic?
Mr. Selimovic?

705
01:13:02,511 --> 01:13:04,240
- Mr. Selimovic.
- Here.

706
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:06,179
Please, follow me.

707
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:14,289
Okay...

708
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:17,019
the bullet entered the front
of the cranium here.

709
01:13:17,059 --> 01:13:20,324
There is a clean hole
in the outer layer

710
01:13:20,362 --> 01:13:22,421
and a shattering
of the inner layer,

711
01:13:22,464 --> 01:13:25,331
but it got no further
than the brain.

712
01:13:26,635 --> 01:13:28,193
The diameter
of the wound...

713
01:13:28,237 --> 01:13:30,899
Wouldn't the bullet normally
pass through the head?

714
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:33,340
Don't you know that?

715
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:35,400
You're the one
who does the shooting.

716
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:40,949
Aside from which part
of the body you are hitting,

717
01:13:40,983 --> 01:13:44,180
I would have thought it depends
on the distance the bullet travels.

718
01:13:44,219 --> 01:13:47,848
The bullet passed
through Lejla's head,

719
01:13:47,890 --> 01:13:50,120
if that information
is of any use to you.

720
01:13:51,126 --> 01:13:53,390
Therefore I would surmise

721
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,489
that this bullet was
at the end of its trajectory.

722
01:13:57,599 --> 01:13:59,829
Therefore shot
from a long distance.

723
01:14:00,969 --> 01:14:02,800
You've had
your two minutes.

724
01:14:04,873 --> 01:14:07,933
- The bullet.
- What?

725
01:14:09,445 --> 01:14:11,879
That killed her.

726
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:40,737
That's five...
600 meters away,

727
01:14:40,776 --> 01:14:42,971
shooting
through buildings.

728
01:14:43,011 --> 01:14:46,970
Everyone killed has been shot
in the head. It's not possible.

729
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:53,852
I couldn't do it...

730
01:14:53,889 --> 01:14:56,153
but it's possible.

731
01:14:57,726 --> 01:15:00,024
Can't you get at him
from here?

732
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:03,429
I only get one chance.
If I miss he'll move.

733
01:15:03,465 --> 01:15:06,434
It's another 15 days
looking for him.

734
01:15:12,074 --> 01:15:15,271
- You see that bus on the Serb side?
- Yeah.

735
01:15:15,310 --> 01:15:17,471
Now if I get a position
behind that,

736
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:20,004
I can reach him going
into the building at the back.

737
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:23,643
The only way to get behind
that bus is crossing the road.

738
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:26,245
We go under the road.

739
01:16:51,540 --> 01:16:53,633
Okay.

740
01:18:31,273 --> 01:18:33,332
I was wrong.

741
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:36,971
I couldn't get
an angle on him.

742
01:20:29,357 --> 01:20:32,690
- Is Natasha here?
- No.

743
01:20:34,095 --> 01:20:36,495
- Where is she?
- She doesn't live here.

744
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:39,762
- I know she lives here.
- I don't know who you mean.

745
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:44,529
- Where is she?
- Please, I don't know.

746
01:20:44,573 --> 01:20:47,098
Freaking liar!
Freaking liar, where is she?

747
01:20:47,142 --> 01:20:49,770
Please, I don't know.

748
01:21:02,591 --> 01:21:06,527
Tell me one more time
that you don't know her,

749
01:21:06,561 --> 01:21:09,052
and I will take you
to Zijah

750
01:21:09,097 --> 01:21:11,065
and I will tell them
you are an informer.

751
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:13,158
Please, no.

752
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:15,192
Sit down.

753
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:18,930
Now you tell me the truth...

754
01:21:18,974 --> 01:21:20,999
and you'll be okay.

755
01:21:29,818 --> 01:21:32,309
So is she your girlfriend?

756
01:21:33,822 --> 01:21:35,813
She's my sister.

757
01:21:51,306 --> 01:21:53,240
Go on, take it.

758
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:25,731
Do you know Slavko Stanic?

759
01:22:33,815 --> 01:22:37,182
Did Slavko invite Natasha
to go with him to Barcelona?

760
01:22:37,218 --> 01:22:39,812
To the Olympics?

761
01:22:42,057 --> 01:22:43,786
He did, didn't he?

762
01:22:47,195 --> 01:22:49,390
I hoped he would.

763
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:54,091
We were all
going together...

764
01:22:55,503 --> 01:22:57,528
my wife,

765
01:22:57,572 --> 01:22:59,699
my daughter,

766
01:22:59,741 --> 01:23:02,209
Slavko,

767
01:23:02,243 --> 01:23:04,177
your sister.

768
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:09,542
Is she with him now?

769
01:23:12,787 --> 01:23:17,156
Slavko...
he's as a brother to me.

770
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:19,888
He means as much to me
as Natasha does to you.

771
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:24,790
What do you want me to do?

772
01:23:26,267 --> 01:23:29,725
- I have to go and see them.
- It's impossible.

773
01:23:29,771 --> 01:23:34,003
- You just tell me where they're living.
- They're up in the hills,

774
01:23:34,042 --> 01:23:36,704
across llidza. It's impossible
to go there now.

775
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:41,349
Draw me a map.

776
01:27:20,935 --> 01:27:24,268
Well, how about that?

777
01:27:30,478 --> 01:27:34,073
Come on in.

778
01:27:53,668 --> 01:27:58,128
Ohh, I was hoping
you'd make it.

779
01:28:05,380 --> 01:28:07,473
Come in, come in.

780
01:28:09,651 --> 01:28:11,448
How did you know
I was coming?

781
01:28:11,486 --> 01:28:14,649
Natasha's brother called on the C.B.
If you had called me yourself,

782
01:28:14,689 --> 01:28:18,090
I would have told those boys on the hill to
hold firing until you were over.

783
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:20,526
Come in.

784
01:28:20,561 --> 01:28:23,394
Natasha!

785
01:28:23,431 --> 01:28:26,127
Get some water and
a towel for our guest.

786
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:29,159
Give me that.

787
01:28:29,203 --> 01:28:32,229
Come in.

788
01:28:57,999 --> 01:28:59,933
There she is.

789
01:29:04,739 --> 01:29:06,866
Isn't she beautiful?

790
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:12,905
- Hi.
- Hi.

791
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:15,916
Ladies and gentlemen,
we will now pay homage

792
01:29:15,950 --> 01:29:19,613
to the athletes and officials
of the 172 delegations

793
01:29:19,654 --> 01:29:24,091
which have taken part
in the games of the 25th Olympiad.

794
01:29:24,125 --> 01:29:26,923
- They are the stars of the ceremony...
- Thanks.

795
01:29:30,431 --> 01:29:33,059
Why have you come here?

796
01:29:33,101 --> 01:29:36,298
Oh, to drink...
to talk, hmm?

797
01:29:37,972 --> 01:29:40,497
Is that true?

798
01:29:41,642 --> 01:29:43,837
Yeah.

799
01:29:43,878 --> 01:29:47,075
Of course it's true.
We've never been apart for so long.

800
01:29:52,854 --> 01:29:55,982
So, ah, what are you
having to drink, hmm?

801
01:29:56,023 --> 01:29:59,151
Cognac, whisky, beer, gin, what do
you want? Anything you want.

802
01:29:59,193 --> 01:30:01,957
- Nothing for me.
- Of course, you're drinking.

803
01:30:01,996 --> 01:30:03,293
No no, not tonight.

804
01:30:03,331 --> 01:30:06,789
You're my guest now,
and tonight you're drinking.

805
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:10,668
Natasha, whisky and ice
for my very best friend.

806
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:15,672
Hey! And the olives.

807
01:30:18,980 --> 01:30:21,141
Why didn't you shoot me
up on the hill?

808
01:30:23,818 --> 01:30:26,844
- Why didn't you shoot me?
- When?

809
01:30:26,888 --> 01:30:29,482
Just now.

810
01:30:29,524 --> 01:30:31,492
Isn't that why you're here,
to kill me?

811
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:33,391
That's your job,
isn't it?

812
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:35,555
Since your factory closed,
your new job?

813
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:40,067
Ah, come on,
we should be celebrating.

814
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:45,472
A game of chess!

815
01:30:45,506 --> 01:30:47,940
Sweetheart, let's have
the chessboard, hmm?

816
01:30:54,916 --> 01:30:56,884
Whose turn to start?

817
01:30:56,918 --> 01:30:58,977
Okay, you're white.

818
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:01,488
I'm going to bed.

819
01:31:01,522 --> 01:31:03,615
If you're staying,
I'll see you in the morning.

820
01:31:03,658 --> 01:31:05,717
Yeah, good night.

821
01:31:07,228 --> 01:31:10,356
Hmm. Good night, sweetheart.
See you later.

822
01:31:18,339 --> 01:31:21,775
I've never met a girl
like her before.

823
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:24,869
Someone who dreams
the same as me.

824
01:31:24,912 --> 01:31:27,540
I don't have to explain
things to her,

825
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:31,450
the way I feel or I think.
She loves me.

826
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:34,284
I tell you, Vlado,
I'm crazy about her.

827
01:31:34,322 --> 01:31:36,620
This is not me
playing games here.

828
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:39,421
First time I ever
felt right with the world.

829
01:31:39,460 --> 01:31:41,894
#It's a very very
very good show #

830
01:31:41,929 --> 01:31:43,157
- # A! #
- # A! #

831
01:31:43,197 --> 01:31:44,459
- # E! #
- # E! #

832
01:31:44,499 --> 01:31:45,761
- # I! #
- # I! #

833
01:31:45,800 --> 01:31:47,131
- # O! #
- # O! #

834
01:31:47,168 --> 01:31:48,465
- # U! #
- # U! #

835
01:31:48,503 --> 01:31:51,495
#A-E-l-O-U! #

836
01:32:08,956 --> 01:32:11,447
So we finally made it
to the Olympics.

837
01:32:24,171 --> 01:32:27,663
You're killing women and children
on your own streets.

838
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:32,144
This is war.

839
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:35,910
You know, you were up on that hill
like a little rabbit, a sitting target.

840
01:32:35,950 --> 01:32:38,578
I could have had you
just like that.

841
01:32:40,821 --> 01:32:42,812
But you know
I'd never kill you.

842
01:32:51,365 --> 01:32:54,857
Do you remember that night in Odessa
after we won the pairs?

843
01:32:56,203 --> 01:32:58,967
Yeah, down on the beach.

844
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:03,270
It was a bottle of this.

845
01:33:03,311 --> 01:33:05,745
I want you to leave
with Natasha tonight.

846
01:33:05,780 --> 01:33:07,873
We never did find out
who took our clothes.

847
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:09,246
You're not listening to me.

848
01:33:09,283 --> 01:33:12,252
- I heard you.
- Slavko, you've got to stop.

849
01:33:12,286 --> 01:33:16,086
50 years ago, my family was taken
from their home, a house like this,

850
01:33:16,123 --> 01:33:19,149
- by Croats and Muslim fascists...
- Yeah, I know what happened.

851
01:33:19,193 --> 01:33:23,061
We all know what happened.
But didn't we learn anything together?

852
01:33:27,735 --> 01:33:29,726
We were friends.

853
01:33:33,074 --> 01:33:36,942
How can you...
find happiness

854
01:33:36,978 --> 01:33:39,708
when you're shooting
on your own people?

855
01:33:40,715 --> 01:33:43,275
I've got my happiness now.

856
01:33:54,795 --> 01:33:56,820
Lejla is dead.

857
01:33:58,532 --> 01:34:00,557
You know that?

858
01:34:00,601 --> 01:34:03,832
Yes, she was shot
in the head by a sniper.

859
01:34:06,574 --> 01:34:08,735
That wasn't me.

860
01:34:11,078 --> 01:34:13,603
Whoever he was,
he was trained by you.

861
01:34:35,202 --> 01:34:38,399
Natasha! Natasha!

862
01:34:40,207 --> 01:34:43,233
Pack everything we can get in the Jeep.
We're leaving tonight.

863
01:34:43,277 --> 01:34:45,802
- Why?
- Don't ask.

864
01:34:45,846 --> 01:34:46,972
But where are we going?

865
01:34:47,014 --> 01:34:49,107
Just do it.
We're going away.

866
01:35:15,609 --> 01:35:18,578
I've been wondering how you've been
doing these last weeks...

867
01:35:18,612 --> 01:35:21,206
- worried, huh?
- Why, of course.

868
01:35:21,248 --> 01:35:23,614
You've spent a lifetime
worrying about me.

869
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:27,017
Where will you go?

870
01:35:27,054 --> 01:35:29,545
You can stop worrying
from now on.

871
01:35:39,467 --> 01:35:41,458
We're finished, Vlado.

872
01:35:41,502 --> 01:35:44,801
No, I want you to call me
and you let me know where you are.

873
01:35:44,839 --> 01:35:46,204
You do that, please.

874
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:48,800
You said it yourself...
"It's too late."

875
01:35:56,851 --> 01:35:59,319
I hate anything to end.

876
01:36:00,321 --> 01:36:02,983
I know you do.

877
01:36:03,023 --> 01:36:06,686
And I've had a lot of tired days
because of that over the years.

878
01:36:07,695 --> 01:36:09,754
Been worth it though.

879
01:38:01,942 --> 01:38:03,739
- You go inside, yeah?
- Okay.

880
01:38:56,263 --> 01:38:58,356
Slavko!

881
01:39:00,701 --> 01:39:02,635
No!

882
01:39:02,670 --> 01:39:05,434
No, no!

883
01:39:47,448 --> 01:39:50,884
Fatigues, flack jacket,
bulletproof vest.

884
01:39:50,918 --> 01:39:55,048
It's all Israeli,
we get what we can find.

885
01:39:55,089 --> 01:39:57,387
Brandy, two bottles...

886
01:39:57,424 --> 01:40:00,018
French.

887
01:40:02,663 --> 01:40:05,689
So... you got him.

888
01:40:06,867 --> 01:40:09,233
Well done.

889
01:41:05,592 --> 01:41:07,583
Yes, sir, can we help you?

890
01:41:16,036 --> 01:41:17,936
What's going on?

891
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:21,731
We have decided
to come to work.

892
01:41:23,677 --> 01:41:27,306
There hasn't been any post for two
months. What're you talking about?

893
01:41:29,183 --> 01:41:31,344
This is our job.

894
01:41:31,385 --> 01:41:34,013
If we want to come to work,
then we will come to work.

895
01:41:34,054 --> 01:41:35,988
And no one's
gonna stop us.

896
01:41:53,407 --> 01:41:55,807
How did you get here?

897
01:41:55,843 --> 01:41:58,334
- Walked.
- From Kosovo?

898
01:41:58,378 --> 01:42:00,209
Yes.

899
01:42:06,653 --> 01:42:09,144
So what time
do you finish?

900
01:42:10,157 --> 01:42:12,421
3:00.

901
01:42:12,459 --> 01:42:14,450
Are you trying
to chat me up?

902
01:42:21,368 --> 01:42:24,565
I'll come outside.

903
01:42:58,138 --> 01:43:00,572
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

904
01:43:05,679 --> 01:43:07,670
I saw Amela last night.

905
01:43:09,416 --> 01:43:12,783
And they're gonna give Lejla a proper
burial when they get the chance.

906
01:43:15,022 --> 01:43:17,957
She said Miso
wants you to be there.

907
01:43:54,461 --> 01:43:55,894
Hello, best friend ever.

908
01:43:55,929 --> 01:43:59,626
I went in the morning
to get water.

909
01:43:59,666 --> 01:44:04,899
There was shooting by the water truck,
but no one was hurt.

910
01:44:07,474 --> 01:44:10,705
Zelijko was crying
when I told him about you.

911
01:44:10,744 --> 01:44:14,680
So you see,
he didn't hate you.

912
01:44:15,782 --> 01:44:18,478
That's all
I can think of today.

913
01:44:18,518 --> 01:44:20,713
I'll be better tomorrow.
