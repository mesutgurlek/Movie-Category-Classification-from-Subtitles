1
00:00:42,692 --> 00:00:45,183
Mr. Duncan Sandys, sir.

2
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:47,158
Good afternoon, sir.

3
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:50,991
Come in, Duncan.

4
00:00:51,167 --> 00:00:52,794
Sit down.

5
00:00:59,342 --> 00:01:01,310
There's a vital job to be done.

6
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:04,970
The outcome of the war
may depend on how you handle it.

7
00:01:05,348 --> 00:01:08,681
You read these reports, the Germans
are developing long-range rockets...

8
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:11,980
...in order to bombard Britain.
- Yes, but they're extremely vague.

9
00:01:12,155 --> 00:01:14,089
And in some respects, contradictory.

10
00:01:14,257 --> 00:01:16,248
But they can't be ignored.

11
00:01:16,426 --> 00:01:19,759
If London and the channeled ports
should come under heavy bombardment...

12
00:01:19,929 --> 00:01:23,194
...we would have to abandon our plan
to land in France next year.

13
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:28,094
I want you to find out quickly
whether this rocket threat is real.

14
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:30,535
And, if so, to recommend
how we should tackle it.

15
00:01:30,707 --> 00:01:34,074
Do you want me to do this as well
as my job at the Ministry of Supply?

16
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:35,802
You think you could manage both?

17
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:39,607
Well, I'll just have to do
with rather less sleep.

18
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:43,412
Your first task will be to collect
all the evidence you can...

19
00:01:43,586 --> 00:01:45,986
...and tell the War Cabinet
what you think about it.

20
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:47,623
All right, sir.

21
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,257
By the way...

22
00:01:56,065 --> 00:01:58,556
...how are your legs since the accident?

23
00:01:59,602 --> 00:02:01,467
Bloody awful.

24
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:31,799
Well, there we are.
Have they got a long-range rocket?

25
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:34,306
We've all seen the reports
from Intelligence.

26
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,445
Perhaps you'd let me have your reactions.

27
00:06:36,612 --> 00:06:39,809
- Professor Lindemann.
- Not very intelligent.

28
00:06:39,982 --> 00:06:42,007
- Would you elaborate on that?
- I can.

29
00:06:42,185 --> 00:06:44,653
- Some of our agents could be wrong...
- There you are.

30
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:47,221
...and some would be right.
- Well, these are wrong.

31
00:06:47,523 --> 00:06:49,150
What makes you think that?

32
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,817
If you were a scientist, you'd know
you cannot get reliable results...

33
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:56,089
...without solid propellants,
such as cordite.

34
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:59,393
With a cordite-propelled rocket
carrying a worthwhile warhead...

35
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:02,129
...you'd need no less than 50 tons of it.
Fifty tons.

36
00:07:02,305 --> 00:07:06,036
Our biggest rocket has only 50 pounds.
Now, I ask you a question, gentlemen.

37
00:07:06,409 --> 00:07:09,310
If we here admitted, which we do not...

38
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:13,415
...the possibility of a rocket project
in Germany, what would you do?

39
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:16,379
Well, there are three avenues
of approach as I see it.

40
00:07:16,552 --> 00:07:19,385
Firstly, I'd go over
all the aerial photographs we've got...

41
00:07:19,555 --> 00:07:21,318
...and I'd try and get some new ones.

42
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:24,722
Next, I'd interrogate
all the available prisoners...

43
00:07:24,894 --> 00:07:27,522
...and then, of course,
I'd send in more agents.

44
00:07:27,697 --> 00:07:28,994
And then?

45
00:07:29,165 --> 00:07:32,066
lf, after that, I still believed
they got rockets...

46
00:07:32,235 --> 00:07:35,762
...l'd recommend bombing their installations
before they got off the ground.

47
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:38,634
That's precisely what the Germans
want you to do.

48
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:43,575
To divert our bombing effort from more
important targets. Look, I'm a scientist.

49
00:07:43,746 --> 00:07:46,408
In peacetime
there are no secrets in science.

50
00:07:46,582 --> 00:07:50,040
And in four years of war,
they couldn't have advanced that far.

51
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,449
Even a less spectacular advance...

52
00:07:52,622 --> 00:07:55,056
...it would have reduced
their war effort immensely.

53
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:58,660
Look, Boyd, send back your agents,
tell them to take a closer look.

54
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:02,992
What about this report that
the Germans are recruiting technicians...

55
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:05,760
...from the occupied countries?
- I can vouch for that.

56
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:08,233
But you can't vouch
for the rocket report.

57
00:08:08,404 --> 00:08:12,340
Agents are like scientists, professor.
Some are good...

58
00:08:12,508 --> 00:08:14,738
...and some are not so good.

59
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:18,112
In my opinion, the whole thing
is a wild goose chase.

60
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:19,646
Well, that remains to be seen.

61
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:23,307
As a scientist,
I was taught to be sure of my facts.

62
00:08:23,486 --> 00:08:28,446
In war, decisions almost always have
to be taken on incomplete knowledge.

63
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:32,390
If you wait until you're certain,
you're sure to be too late.

64
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,954
What's the matter with that man?

65
00:08:36,132 --> 00:08:39,465
He may be a brilliant scientist,
but he can't always be right.

66
00:08:39,635 --> 00:08:43,503
As far as I'm concerned, he hasn't
explained away our Intelligence report.

67
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:47,632
Just because he can't build a rocket
doesn't mean to say the Germans can't.

68
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:52,873
For the sake of argument, let's assume they
have got one in the experimental stage.

69
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:54,949
Now, where would they test it?

70
00:08:55,718 --> 00:08:59,245
Not in one of the occupied countries,
because they couldn't trust anybody.

71
00:08:59,422 --> 00:09:02,983
They'd take it as far away from us
as possible to make it difficult to bomb.

72
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:05,016
Somewhere near the sea...

73
00:09:05,194 --> 00:09:09,392
...so the duds wouldn't do any damage
and wouldn't leave a trace.

74
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,091
So it's gotta be the Baltic, hasn't it?

75
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:03,930
Sir.

76
00:13:04,099 --> 00:13:06,966
Sir, would you come
and look at this, please?

77
00:13:12,908 --> 00:13:16,469
- What am I supposed to be looking at?
- There, sir. On the left.

78
00:13:19,148 --> 00:13:20,410
I don't know, Babs.

79
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:24,212
We know they're extending their airfield.
Could it be anything to do with that?

80
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:27,184
Dredging operations. Drains.

81
00:13:27,356 --> 00:13:28,687
What do they want in London?

82
00:13:28,858 --> 00:13:32,089
Oh, they want us to probe
every sortie for rocket installations.

83
00:13:32,261 --> 00:13:34,559
- Sims, would you take this?
- Rocket installations?

84
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,493
What are they supposed to look like?

85
00:13:36,665 --> 00:13:38,064
Nobody knows.

86
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,168
Something unusual.
They're new weapons...

87
00:13:40,336 --> 00:13:42,964
...so we can't expect to see
anything we've seen before.

88
00:13:43,138 --> 00:13:45,368
- So unusual we wouldn't even notice them?
- Maybe.

89
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:48,101
Something we wouldn't even notice?

90
00:13:48,444 --> 00:13:52,312
Sir, there is something.
I spotted it the other day.

91
00:13:52,481 --> 00:13:53,812
Look.

92
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,881
There, see?

93
00:14:01,690 --> 00:14:03,317
Take a look at these.

94
00:14:03,826 --> 00:14:05,350
Wait a minute.

95
00:14:10,966 --> 00:14:12,900
Wait a minute.

96
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:16,970
The place is called Peenemünde.

97
00:14:17,139 --> 00:14:19,130
- Where is it?
- It's on the Baltic coast.

98
00:14:19,308 --> 00:14:22,869
You see, there's a new power station
they've just built here at Köplin.

99
00:14:23,045 --> 00:14:24,979
It's much too big for ordinary use.

100
00:14:25,147 --> 00:14:28,048
There's power lines radiating about
all over the place.

101
00:14:28,217 --> 00:14:30,742
Up there among the trees,
there are some new workshops.

102
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:32,945
Down here,
there's some reclamation work.

103
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,784
I don't see what this has got
to do with rockets.

104
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,654
All these installations seem
to be perfectly consistent...

105
00:14:38,827 --> 00:14:41,694
...with the place being
a rocket-firing establishment.

106
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:45,864
What about these circular earthworks
in the woods here?

107
00:14:46,035 --> 00:14:48,560
Mightn't they be test stands
for launching rockets?

108
00:14:48,737 --> 00:14:51,706
They're not gonna put a firing point
in the middle of the island.

109
00:14:51,874 --> 00:14:53,171
It would be too risky.

110
00:14:53,342 --> 00:14:56,607
If they have any,
they'll put them right on the coast.

111
00:14:56,779 --> 00:15:00,408
Whatever they are, the Germans
aren't making all this effort for our benefit.

112
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:05,111
I'm not gonna believe your fairy tales
until you show me a photograph of a rocket.

113
00:15:05,287 --> 00:15:09,223
Well, we'll just have to go on photographing
until we find one.

114
00:15:43,926 --> 00:15:46,793
- Flight Officer Babington Smith.
- How do you do?

115
00:15:46,962 --> 00:15:49,157
- You got something new on Peenemünde?
- Yes, sir.

116
00:15:49,331 --> 00:15:51,458
Yes. The N8.60 cover,
that's all ready for you.

117
00:15:51,634 --> 00:15:54,865
- How many times have we photographed it?
- Ten times now, sir.

118
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:57,301
Am I supposed
to look at anything in particular?

119
00:15:57,473 --> 00:16:00,033
Just here on the coast.
I think this will interest you.

120
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:04,805
- In the middle of that elliptical earthwork.
- Next to that sort of observation tower.

121
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,881
A torpedo-like object on a transporter.

122
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:10,518
Oh, yes. Yes, I can see it.

123
00:16:10,686 --> 00:16:13,484
We can estimate the size.
It's about 38 feet long, sir.

124
00:16:15,524 --> 00:16:18,152
- Could it be?
- We've never seen anything like it before.

125
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:21,290
The shape's right, the observation tower,
the whole setup.

126
00:16:22,264 --> 00:16:23,993
I'd take a heavy bet on it.

127
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,064
Yes, I think you're right.

128
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:29,261
It's a bloody great rocket.

129
00:16:35,344 --> 00:16:37,244
It's a balloon.

130
00:16:37,746 --> 00:16:39,873
- You can't be serious.
- It's a barrage balloon.

131
00:16:40,049 --> 00:16:43,143
- I'm interested to hear you say that...
- It's a barrage balloon.

132
00:16:43,318 --> 00:16:46,082
- Partially deflated.
- With a damn great transporter.

133
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,246
Why not? The shape's convenient.

134
00:16:48,424 --> 00:16:50,722
About 7 feet across
and 50 feet in length.

135
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:54,124
Yes, but these vehicles
are designed to carry up to 25 tons.

136
00:16:54,296 --> 00:16:56,890
Putting a barrage balloon
on them would be like...

137
00:16:57,066 --> 00:17:00,160
Like putting a lightweight jockey
on an elephant?

138
00:17:00,335 --> 00:17:02,132
It's a balloon.

139
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:07,068
Well, the photographic interpreters tell us
it's a rocket, and I'm quite satisfied it is.

140
00:17:07,242 --> 00:17:09,142
Laughable. It's a hoax.

141
00:17:09,311 --> 00:17:11,404
It's a damned expensive one.

142
00:17:11,580 --> 00:17:15,107
Tractors, cranes,
launching equipment, living quarters.

143
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,683
It could be a naval base.

144
00:17:16,852 --> 00:17:19,082
They might be testing
some kind of torpedo.

145
00:17:19,254 --> 00:17:22,155
Oh, so now your balloon's a torpedo?

146
00:17:22,324 --> 00:17:23,951
One must explore all possibilities.

147
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:27,289
Every possibility except the possibility
that it might be a rocket.

148
00:17:27,596 --> 00:17:30,497
If it were a rocket,
it could never get off the ground.

149
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,531
And if it were a torpedo...

150
00:17:32,701 --> 00:17:34,726
...what ship's going to be able
to launch it?

151
00:17:34,903 --> 00:17:37,963
Whatever it is, I think you're making
a mountain out of a molehill.

152
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:40,005
You mean a torpedo out of a balloon.

153
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:45,010
I take it, then, that you still don't think
Peenemünde should be bombed.

154
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:47,011
Certainly not.

155
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:49,343
Air marshal, what have you got to say?

156
00:17:49,518 --> 00:17:54,114
Well, to attack Peenemünde would mean
diverting the RAF from their main task...

157
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:56,849
...which is to destroy German industry.
- Quite.

158
00:17:57,726 --> 00:17:59,751
And apart from that,
to reach Peenemünde...

159
00:17:59,928 --> 00:18:02,419
...we'd have to fly
through their air-defense system.

160
00:18:02,598 --> 00:18:04,156
No fighter cover, I suppose?

161
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:06,563
I'm afraid not at that distance.

162
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:09,898
And once we've attacked it,
the whole place will bristle with guns.

163
00:18:10,072 --> 00:18:14,304
So we'd have to make sure that
we make a job of it first time.

164
00:18:14,476 --> 00:18:17,604
- How would you do that?
- We'd have to send the whole bomber force.

165
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,708
- How many planes?
- Oh, about 600.

166
00:18:20,883 --> 00:18:23,977
And if the German fighters
intercepted in strength...

167
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:28,283
...we could lose the lot in one night,
and with it, the war.

168
00:18:28,457 --> 00:18:30,516
Are you prepared
to take such a risk, Sandys?

169
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:34,354
We'll never win the war
unless we are prepared to take risks.

170
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:36,054
Sometimes great risks.

171
00:18:36,231 --> 00:18:37,960
So, what are you going to do?

172
00:18:38,867 --> 00:18:40,994
I shall recommend to the War Cabinet...

173
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,367
...that Peenemünde be bombed
as quickly as possible.

174
00:24:51,439 --> 00:24:53,930
The first Intelligence reports
have come in, sir.

175
00:24:54,109 --> 00:24:55,770
It seems we did the job.

176
00:24:55,944 --> 00:24:57,912
All installations
have been blown sky-high.

177
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:01,913
- Peenemünde's been smashed to bits.
- What about our losses? Any idea?

178
00:25:02,083 --> 00:25:06,076
So far, 40 aircraft out of 571.

179
00:25:07,322 --> 00:25:08,755
Right.

180
00:25:11,626 --> 00:25:13,719
We've gained time.
That's the important thing.

181
00:25:13,895 --> 00:25:16,693
Yes. Precious time.

182
00:25:17,265 --> 00:25:19,893
We can't afford to waste a minute of it.

183
00:26:07,349 --> 00:26:09,715
We discovered that large numbers
of engineers...

184
00:26:09,884 --> 00:26:12,409
...were passing through Hamburg,
Bremen and Cologne.

185
00:26:12,587 --> 00:26:14,680
The trail led us to this area around here.

186
00:26:14,856 --> 00:26:18,622
- It's a new factory deep underground.
- What makes you think it's a rocket factory?

187
00:26:18,793 --> 00:26:21,455
Because all the men going there
are top-grade specialists.

188
00:26:21,630 --> 00:26:24,190
They're taking them
from aircraft and radio factories...

189
00:26:24,366 --> 00:26:26,334
...chemical plants, research laboratories.

190
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,902
- The skills you'd need for making rockets.
- Right.

191
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:32,869
We never expected the Germans
to give up after Peenemünde.

192
00:26:33,041 --> 00:26:36,408
They must know we're planning
to invade Europe this summer.

193
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:40,240
Supposing they've begun
mass-producing these things.

194
00:26:40,415 --> 00:26:42,280
If they could get them off the ground...

195
00:26:42,450 --> 00:26:45,578
...if they could launch a saturation attack
against this country...

196
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:48,348
...we could lose the war
at the very last minute.

197
00:26:50,225 --> 00:26:52,284
Can you find out any more
about this place?

198
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:53,791
Tricky.

199
00:26:53,962 --> 00:26:59,025
The only way would be to get some of
our own agents right inside the factory.

200
00:26:59,401 --> 00:27:03,098
Still, the Germans are crying out
for engineers.

201
00:27:03,271 --> 00:27:06,104
- It's possible.
- Men with technical knowledge...

202
00:27:06,274 --> 00:27:07,832
...foreign languages...

203
00:27:08,009 --> 00:27:10,239
...who'd also make good agents:

204
00:27:10,812 --> 00:27:12,370
They'd be pretty rare birds.

205
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:14,572
Yes. Especially in the shooting season.

206
00:27:14,749 --> 00:27:17,149
Looks like a recruiting drive right away,
doesn't it?

207
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:20,686
Among the armed forces
and the government departments.

208
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:25,383
If we interview a thousand men,
we'll be lucky to find 12 suitable.

209
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:28,028
Well, the sooner you find them,
the better.

210
00:27:34,969 --> 00:27:37,995
- Two pound on the clock, guv.
- Right. Wait for me.

211
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:40,733
- Here, work on that.
- Thanks very much. Ta.

212
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:43,605
Be right back. And remember...

213
00:27:43,778 --> 00:27:46,144
...concentrate on what I told you.

214
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:52,648
Next, please.

215
00:27:53,955 --> 00:27:56,549
Oh, that's me.

216
00:27:57,192 --> 00:28:00,719
- An article there on Holland.
- Thank you.

217
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:05,623
Take a chair, please, sir.

218
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:17,039
- You been waiting long?
- A few minutes.

219
00:28:18,313 --> 00:28:21,714
Do you have any idea
what this is all about?

220
00:28:22,117 --> 00:28:23,550
Engineers who speak languages.

221
00:28:23,718 --> 00:28:25,879
I only took it so I could
get a day in London.

222
00:28:26,054 --> 00:28:28,022
But I don't wanna spend it here.

223
00:28:30,258 --> 00:28:32,488
But look, I was brought up in Germany.

224
00:28:32,827 --> 00:28:36,991
Your German's very good. So good you'd
be a loss to the Ministry of Information.

225
00:28:37,365 --> 00:28:41,392
I studied Applied Mechanics in Dresden,
I do assure you.

226
00:28:41,569 --> 00:28:43,901
I may be a bit rusty,
but I can easily brush it up.

227
00:28:44,072 --> 00:28:46,700
I'm afraid your technical knowledge
isn't up to standard.

228
00:28:46,875 --> 00:28:48,866
I really am very sorry.

229
00:28:49,911 --> 00:28:51,208
Well...

230
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,413
Next, please.

231
00:28:58,052 --> 00:29:00,520
- Excuse me.
- What did they ask you?

232
00:29:00,688 --> 00:29:03,657
Damn fool questions. Usual chaos.
They don't know what they want.

233
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:06,350
I hope they don't want me.
I wanna get back to my ship.

234
00:29:06,528 --> 00:29:08,291
Well, I hope you do.

235
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:10,527
Next, please.

236
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,937
- Bradley.
- Oh, yes, sir.

237
00:29:17,105 --> 00:29:19,130
Take a chair, sir, please, sir.

238
00:29:20,074 --> 00:29:22,235
- Thank you, sergeant.
- Sir.

239
00:29:24,479 --> 00:29:26,811
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

240
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,215
Funny fellow.

241
00:29:34,722 --> 00:29:40,820
I did three years special study of ballistics
at the Royal Institute in Den Helder.

242
00:29:40,995 --> 00:29:44,897
And then supervisory work
at an ordnance factory in Hembrug.

243
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:47,296
You're familiar with the dynamics
of projectiles?

244
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:49,266
Oh, yes, sir. Yes.

245
00:29:49,437 --> 00:29:50,802
What about your family?

246
00:29:50,972 --> 00:29:52,940
- Are they still in Holland?
- Yes.

247
00:29:53,107 --> 00:29:55,735
My mother and two sisters.

248
00:29:56,044 --> 00:29:57,102
What about you?

249
00:29:57,278 --> 00:30:00,304
I'm making a rather vain attempt
to further my unmilitary career.

250
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:03,610
Thought there might be something in this.
I'm with a tiresome lot...

251
00:30:03,785 --> 00:30:06,345
...under canvas in the wilds of Essex.
Not enjoying it.

252
00:30:06,521 --> 00:30:08,785
- I don't blame you.
- Next, please.

253
00:30:10,024 --> 00:30:13,118
Do you mind? I shan't keep you a moment.
I'm in a tearing hurry.

254
00:30:15,096 --> 00:30:17,257
Next gentleman, please.

255
00:30:21,135 --> 00:30:22,363
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

256
00:30:22,537 --> 00:30:24,698
- It's me, Curtis.
- Curtis?

257
00:30:24,873 --> 00:30:26,773
You remember me, don't you?

258
00:30:26,941 --> 00:30:29,967
- Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
- Nice to see you.

259
00:30:48,463 --> 00:30:52,729
I must say, I can't fault your German.
It's perfect.

260
00:30:52,901 --> 00:30:55,096
- Cambridge?
- Fluid mechanics, sir.

261
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:57,670
I gave up pure mathematics
after the first year...

262
00:30:57,839 --> 00:31:01,400
...and then more recently I've been messing
about with anti-aircraft rockets.

263
00:31:02,310 --> 00:31:04,676
These rather secret people I'm with...

264
00:31:04,846 --> 00:31:07,440
The first rocket I built
rose three feet into the ground.

265
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:11,676
The second took off horizontally, straight
through a henhouse, and killed 40 roosters.

266
00:31:11,853 --> 00:31:13,650
How very discouraging for you.

267
00:31:14,055 --> 00:31:15,989
What did you do after that?

268
00:31:16,691 --> 00:31:18,318
Buried the roosters, sir.

269
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:22,296
Mastered at the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology in physics...

270
00:31:22,463 --> 00:31:25,261
...and graduated magna cum laude.

271
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:27,867
Have you worked in any
of your father's factories?

272
00:31:28,036 --> 00:31:29,594
What for?

273
00:31:30,171 --> 00:31:33,197
Have you had any practical experience?

274
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:35,709
Flying a P-38?

275
00:31:35,877 --> 00:31:37,811
Thank you, lieutenant.

276
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:40,973
- We'll let you know.
- Thank you.

277
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:46,677
I say, Curtis, it was Birmingham,
wasn't it?

278
00:31:46,854 --> 00:31:48,947
No, further south.

279
00:31:49,123 --> 00:31:50,784
South?

280
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,127
Further south.

281
00:31:54,529 --> 00:31:55,962
Good morning, Captain Bradley.

282
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,757
Finished?

283
00:31:57,932 --> 00:31:59,559
Next, please.

284
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:03,796
- How did you get on?
- Sent back to the base.

285
00:32:03,972 --> 00:32:06,463
They said they'd let me know.
What, they didn't say.

286
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:08,734
Probably planning
some new secret weapon.

287
00:32:08,910 --> 00:32:11,174
That reminds me.
Can I give you a ride in my cab?

288
00:32:11,346 --> 00:32:14,008
Thank you very much.
If it's not out of your way. Boodles.

289
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,116
Boodles? What's that?

290
00:32:16,284 --> 00:32:17,911
Club, old boy.

291
00:32:18,086 --> 00:32:19,314
Sure.

292
00:32:19,821 --> 00:32:23,951
Come on, jump!
Cut the conversation and jump.

293
00:32:24,125 --> 00:32:27,060
Come on, you idle lots. Jump!

294
00:32:27,228 --> 00:32:28,661
He's getting excited again.

295
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,821
I think he wants you to jump, old boy.

296
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:33,160
- You think that's it?
- Afraid so.

297
00:32:33,568 --> 00:32:35,365
- Jump.
- Yeah. I guess you're right.

298
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:37,629
Gate's open.

299
00:32:40,475 --> 00:32:42,568
- Red brake off.
- Brake off.

300
00:32:51,786 --> 00:32:54,812
- There you are, sergeant.
- There you bloody well are not, sir.

301
00:32:54,989 --> 00:32:57,822
If that was a parachute descent,
you'd have broken your legs.

302
00:32:57,992 --> 00:33:00,153
You're behaving like an irresponsible nit.

303
00:33:00,328 --> 00:33:04,287
Now get back up that tower again
and do a parachute landing as I've told you.

304
00:33:04,465 --> 00:33:06,660
Get back up the tower.

305
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:08,494
Sir.

306
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,661
Gate's open.

307
00:33:13,174 --> 00:33:16,200
- Red brake off.
- Red brake off.

308
00:33:30,725 --> 00:33:32,716
Sir, where's your hat?

309
00:33:34,095 --> 00:33:38,088
Your jumping hat, sir. The hat I drew
from stores for you for parachute training.

310
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,234
Why aren't you wearing it on your head?

311
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:42,460
- You mean this one?
- I mean that one, sir.

312
00:33:42,837 --> 00:33:46,568
Take if off there, put it back on your head
and get back up the tower.

313
00:33:46,741 --> 00:33:49,904
- Up the tower, sir?
- Yes, sir, up the tower.

314
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:55,044
- Red brake off.
- Red brake off.

315
00:33:55,216 --> 00:33:57,446
- Red brake off.
- Red brake off.

316
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,711
Gate's open.

317
00:34:02,090 --> 00:34:04,820
- Red brake off!
- Red brake off.

318
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:20,507
Bloody good.

319
00:34:25,747 --> 00:34:30,480
We want you to pass as engineers
from a German-occupied country.

320
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:35,054
The Dutch will help you
join one of the parties...

321
00:34:35,223 --> 00:34:37,987
...the Germans are taking
to their underground factories.

322
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,027
Your job will be
to get information back to us.

323
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:44,354
Now, you two go to Holland.

324
00:34:44,532 --> 00:34:46,500
You'll have a much easier time
in Brussels.

325
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:51,036
All you have to do is to sift the information,
decide what's worth sending, what isn't.

326
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,706
- Will we be parachuted in, sir?
- Yes.

327
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:57,334
Now, here are your identities.

328
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,674
Erik Van Ostamgen.

329
00:35:01,616 --> 00:35:03,709
Jean Marcel.

330
00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:06,314
Jacob Bijus.

331
00:35:06,888 --> 00:35:10,255
On this mission, your face is your fortune.
You look very much like him.

332
00:35:10,424 --> 00:35:12,085
- Yes.
- How do I get to look like him?

333
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,887
A bit po-faced, isn't he?

334
00:35:14,061 --> 00:35:17,997
- I'd hate to meet him in a dark alley.
- You won't. These three men are dead.

335
00:35:18,166 --> 00:35:20,031
Two were Dutch
engineering specialists...

336
00:35:20,201 --> 00:35:22,999
...working at the Skoda factory
in Pilsen, Czechoslovakia.

337
00:35:23,171 --> 00:35:26,504
The third came from Paris,
a professor of applied mathematics.

338
00:35:26,674 --> 00:35:28,141
Now, he can wait.

339
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:29,970
But you two are urgent.

340
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:33,378
You've gotta think in Dutch,
think in German, think in French.

341
00:35:33,848 --> 00:35:36,408
- Any idea how these men died?
- We're not certain.

342
00:35:36,584 --> 00:35:39,849
- The papers only came in last week.
- You're not certain?

343
00:35:40,321 --> 00:35:42,516
No German is going to ask you
how you died.

344
00:35:43,291 --> 00:35:46,556
Bob and I have to take the identities
of these dead, pro-Nazi Dutchmen.

345
00:35:46,727 --> 00:35:48,888
- We don't know they were pro-Nazi.
- You don't?

346
00:35:49,397 --> 00:35:51,024
- No.
- What do you call this mission?

347
00:35:51,199 --> 00:35:53,099
Operation Question Mark?

348
00:35:53,301 --> 00:35:58,170
Curtis, we want you for this job,
but you don't have to take it.

349
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:01,573
Well, would you like my answer
right now?

350
00:36:03,077 --> 00:36:07,173
- Who's that?
- Me again, Eric Van Ostamgen.

351
00:36:07,682 --> 00:36:10,242
- Leyden University.
- And?

352
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:13,751
And I studied for five years
in the Faculty of Science.

353
00:36:15,289 --> 00:36:16,881
My brother, Willem Bijus.

354
00:36:18,693 --> 00:36:21,685
My father, Karl Van Ostamgen.

355
00:36:21,963 --> 00:36:23,931
I really gave him a bad time.

356
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:25,895
Seen much of him lately?

357
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:29,059
Not much. He's dead, actually.

358
00:36:29,403 --> 00:36:32,133
He died April 30th, 1937.

359
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:36,406
- Now, when am I gonna see my wife?
- Your ex-wife. She divorced you, remember?

360
00:36:36,577 --> 00:36:38,568
- Yes. Silly girl.
- Right.

361
00:37:02,203 --> 00:37:05,468
Thanks. That helps a lot.
She could be my mother.

362
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:07,767
- What year were you married?
- 1936.

363
00:37:07,942 --> 00:37:09,034
- Where?
- Rome.

364
00:37:09,210 --> 00:37:10,370
- Where'd you meet?
- Capri.

365
00:37:10,544 --> 00:37:13,172
- Children's names?
- Piet, he's six. Erica, she's four.

366
00:37:13,347 --> 00:37:14,575
Birth dates?

367
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:18,845
Piet, March 22nd, 1937.
Erica, June 13th, 1939.

368
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,420
I've got a court order
to give me access to see them.

369
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:25,821
- Not bad. Not bad at all.
- Thanks. I just wish I looked like him.

370
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:29,156
If the Germans kept a photographic record
of all their workers...

371
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:31,992
...they'd need a filing cabinet
as big as Hitler's ego.

372
00:37:32,533 --> 00:37:33,761
Who's that?

373
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:35,300
Me, Jacob Bijus.

374
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:36,936
- Family?
- One brother.

375
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:39,900
- Your father?
- He left home when I was 3.

376
00:37:40,074 --> 00:37:41,871
What year was that?

377
00:37:59,126 --> 00:38:01,458
We're over Holland.

378
00:38:02,897 --> 00:38:05,331
It's almost time for our orders.

379
00:38:07,568 --> 00:38:09,661
What do you bet
we get down on the ground...

380
00:38:09,837 --> 00:38:16,242
...we'll find General Boyd to show us slides
of our prenatal experiences?

381
00:38:17,812 --> 00:38:20,007
"Your Agent will identify himself
to you...

382
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:24,982
...by offering you a cigarette from
a cigarette case that has no cigarettes."

383
00:38:25,286 --> 00:38:27,083
- Navigator.
- <i>Yes.</i>

384
00:38:27,254 --> 00:38:30,621
- We're approaching drop zone.
- <i>Right.</i>

385
00:38:37,298 --> 00:38:39,562
Check equipment.

386
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:42,892
Action stations!

387
00:38:44,138 --> 00:38:46,766
Stand in the door.

388
00:38:49,176 --> 00:38:52,270
If your chute doesn't open,
change it for a harp.

389
00:38:52,913 --> 00:38:54,608
Jump!

390
00:38:57,785 --> 00:38:59,252
I'm not musical!

391
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,944
Jump!

392
00:39:07,895 --> 00:39:10,329
<i>There's a message to return, sir.</i>

393
00:39:10,498 --> 00:39:12,363
Who says so?

394
00:39:13,367 --> 00:39:16,632
Base, sir. Message reads,
"Operation cancelled. Return to base."

395
00:39:16,804 --> 00:39:19,534
Cancel it? Now?

396
00:39:35,322 --> 00:39:37,552
Come in, Bradley.
Glad you're here. Sit down.

397
00:39:37,725 --> 00:39:39,693
- Thank you, sir,
- We're in a bit of a mess.

398
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:41,623
I've just got a signal from Holland.

399
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,991
Jacob Bijus is wanted by the police.

400
00:39:44,165 --> 00:39:47,225
- I thought he was dead, sir.
- He is. But the Germans don't know it.

401
00:39:47,401 --> 00:39:51,098
So if Henshaw's picked up, he could be
in a spot of trouble, couldn't he?

402
00:39:51,272 --> 00:39:52,864
Can't your people warn him, sir?

403
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:57,909
Communication is unreliable. It isn't exactly
like sending a birthday telegram, you know.

404
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:02,914
I'm sorry, Bradley,
I haven't got anybody else.

405
00:40:03,084 --> 00:40:05,609
I was almost looking forward
to going to Brussels, sir.

406
00:40:05,786 --> 00:40:07,913
Thought I might find
a decent bottle of claret.

407
00:40:08,089 --> 00:40:12,082
The best my wine merchant can rustle up
is a rather timorous Chateau Lafon '32.

408
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:14,022
It'll taste better when you get it.

409
00:40:14,195 --> 00:40:17,255
Henshaw's new identity papers
are sewn into the spine of this book.

410
00:40:17,431 --> 00:40:19,365
I have a most awful habit
of losing books.

411
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:21,228
For God's sake, don't lose that one.

412
00:40:21,402 --> 00:40:22,801
Now, here are your new papers.

413
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:26,701
Your name is Engel,
Dr. Engel, traveling from Pilsen.

414
00:40:26,874 --> 00:40:30,275
Your background's a bit sketchy.
We haven't had a great deal of time.

415
00:40:30,444 --> 00:40:33,811
- But supposing I'm questioned, sir?
- You'll have to use your imagination.

416
00:40:33,981 --> 00:40:38,077
Have to lose the handlebars. Don't worry,
you'll only be in Germany a couple of days.

417
00:40:38,252 --> 00:40:41,653
- I'm greatly relieved to hear it, sir.
- Let's have a look over the ground.

418
00:40:41,822 --> 00:40:44,052
Your dropping zone is here.

419
00:40:44,225 --> 00:40:47,558
Now, our chaps will be there
to take care of you. Code word "Lorelei."

420
00:40:47,728 --> 00:40:48,956
"Lorelei," sir.

421
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:52,463
You will take Henshaw and Curtis's
route up the Rhine.

422
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:54,498
Up the Rhine, sir.

423
00:41:14,922 --> 00:41:16,913
This is your baggage.

424
00:41:17,091 --> 00:41:19,321
Over two hours shall we come
by the frontier.

425
00:41:19,493 --> 00:41:21,620
From then, I cannot help you no more.

426
00:41:21,795 --> 00:41:25,595
But I thought you were supposed to tell us
where we are going.

427
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:27,993
This is your way to the hotel.

428
00:41:28,169 --> 00:41:31,468
You will show your papers
and get rooms like other engineers.

429
00:41:31,639 --> 00:41:33,607
The Gestapo will not suspect nothing.

430
00:41:33,774 --> 00:41:35,867
I don't like the double negative.

431
00:41:36,043 --> 00:41:39,410
Sorry. I do not understand
the English too well.

432
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,745
Glad to hear it.

433
00:43:22,182 --> 00:43:23,877
Cigarette?

434
00:43:32,826 --> 00:43:34,418
Cigarette?

435
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,535
Van Ostamgen.

436
00:44:27,181 --> 00:44:28,876
Bijus?

437
00:44:30,784 --> 00:44:32,752
Jacob Bijus.

438
00:45:04,485 --> 00:45:06,851
- Have you a fire?
- Yeah.

439
00:45:14,495 --> 00:45:15,792
Cigarette?

440
00:46:38,212 --> 00:46:39,440
Something's gone wrong.

441
00:46:39,613 --> 00:46:41,342
The police have taken your papers.

442
00:46:41,515 --> 00:46:43,949
You'd better go to Room 119.

443
00:46:44,117 --> 00:46:46,677
If one of you gets into trouble,
the other must be safe.

444
00:46:46,854 --> 00:46:50,756
- What does the Gestapo want with Bob?
- It's not the Gestapo. It's the police.

445
00:46:50,924 --> 00:46:52,983
- What's the reason?
- I wish I knew.

446
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:58,598
You'd better pack as fast as you can and
go to Room 119. I'll get it ready for you.

447
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,327
- I'll see you in a minute.
- Right.

448
00:47:01,502 --> 00:47:03,732
Make sure that that door is locked
after he goes.

449
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:07,169
Maybe they'll move the engineers out
before anything can happen to him.

450
00:47:07,341 --> 00:47:09,741
I'll try and find out something.

451
00:47:10,143 --> 00:47:13,010
- Oh, stay in your room.
- Don't worry.

452
00:47:39,106 --> 00:47:42,075
Don't worry.
At least it's not the Gestapo.

453
00:47:42,242 --> 00:47:44,005
Who's worried?

454
00:47:44,177 --> 00:47:47,078
We can always meet during the air raids.

455
00:48:18,779 --> 00:48:21,976
The man downstairs told me room 111.

456
00:48:24,384 --> 00:48:27,182
I heard you speaking English just now.

457
00:48:27,788 --> 00:48:31,121
It's none of my business.
I guess I am the one who should explain.

458
00:48:31,291 --> 00:48:33,657
No, no, that's perfectly all right.

459
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:37,024
I work for the Propaganda Ministry,
broadcasting on the radio.

460
00:48:37,197 --> 00:48:40,963
They must have given me
the wrong room number. I'm very sorry.

461
00:48:41,501 --> 00:48:43,162
Not at all.

462
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,542
This is my husband's room.

463
00:48:52,646 --> 00:48:55,114
Of course. I should have noticed.
I'm sorry.

464
00:48:55,616 --> 00:48:59,780
- Are you a friend of Erik?
- Yes, I'm waiting for him.

465
00:48:59,953 --> 00:49:02,945
- Where is he?
- I don't know. He went out.

466
00:49:03,123 --> 00:49:04,988
Oh, thank God I found him at last.

467
00:49:05,759 --> 00:49:07,624
If only you knew what it means to me.

468
00:49:07,794 --> 00:49:13,664
- Well, this is quite a surprise for him too.
- He has to sign an important paper for me.

469
00:49:13,834 --> 00:49:16,394
We arranged to meet in Hamburg
weeks ago.

470
00:49:16,570 --> 00:49:21,598
I get to Hamburg and they tell me he has
been transferred to Prague. I go to Prague.

471
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,207
Oh, it's nothing. He wasn't there.

472
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:28,212
God, the traveling I've done.
Hotels, offices, hospitals.

473
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:31,408
- I even had him reported missing.
- You did?

474
00:49:32,986 --> 00:49:37,582
Yes. Then the police told me
he was here perhaps.

475
00:49:40,727 --> 00:49:43,628
- Will he be long?
- I've no idea.

476
00:49:43,797 --> 00:49:46,231
If I knew where he was
I could go and find him.

477
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:47,958
Yes.

478
00:49:49,136 --> 00:49:53,436
- Maybe I'll call up the police here.
- I'm sorry, that's out of order.

479
00:49:53,607 --> 00:49:55,472
Won't you sit down?

480
00:49:56,476 --> 00:49:58,171
Oh, sure.

481
00:50:35,382 --> 00:50:37,145
I'm going back to Italy to my parents.

482
00:50:37,317 --> 00:50:39,581
But I can't take the children
without his consent.

483
00:50:39,753 --> 00:50:42,688
It's the law in Holland, you know.

484
00:50:42,856 --> 00:50:45,416
Is that why you have
to have him sign the paper?

485
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:51,196
How long have you known Erik?

486
00:50:51,865 --> 00:50:54,993
I met him a couple of months ago
in a railroad station.

487
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,061
Here he is.

488
00:51:02,109 --> 00:51:05,340
This is Frau Van Ostamgen.
This is our housekeeper.

489
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:10,116
Oh, she speaks excellent English.
She's waiting for her husband.

490
00:51:10,951 --> 00:51:14,011
I told her I didn't know
when Erik would be back.

491
00:51:14,187 --> 00:51:15,415
Do you have any idea?

492
00:51:15,589 --> 00:51:18,752
Well, I am sorry, but I've come up
for the very purpose...

493
00:51:18,925 --> 00:51:23,362
...of packing Herr Van Ostamgen's
luggage and putting it in storage.

494
00:51:23,530 --> 00:51:24,758
But why?

495
00:51:24,931 --> 00:51:26,660
A message from the Labor Office.

496
00:51:26,833 --> 00:51:29,768
They had to send your husband away
all of a sudden.

497
00:51:29,936 --> 00:51:33,201
Oh, no. But where have they sent him?

498
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,968
They didn't say.

499
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:39,334
- Would you give me a hand?
- I'd be glad to. I'm sorry.

500
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,913
But... But who could I ask?
Who can tell me?

501
00:51:42,082 --> 00:51:44,141
Oh, I don't think it's any use inquiring.

502
00:51:44,317 --> 00:51:47,480
From here on, his destination
is a military secret.

503
00:51:47,654 --> 00:51:51,647
If you take my advice, you'll go home and
wait for him to send you his code address.

504
00:51:51,825 --> 00:51:53,190
It's the best thing, really.

505
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:57,353
I've been traveling for two days. I'm tired.
Could I stay here? I must get some sleep.

506
00:51:57,531 --> 00:52:01,023
- Impossible. This room has been taken.
- I could wait in the lounge, then.

507
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:04,967
The lounge has been closed
ever since the air raids started.

508
00:52:05,138 --> 00:52:08,335
The porter will help you
with the luggage.

509
00:52:09,743 --> 00:52:11,643
I'm so sorry.

510
00:52:14,247 --> 00:52:15,839
Please?

511
00:52:19,486 --> 00:52:21,818
Aren't you going to open the door?
It's the police.

512
00:53:19,846 --> 00:53:21,313
Erik Van Ostamgen.

513
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:55,974
It's all right, let her go.

514
00:53:56,683 --> 00:53:59,311
Who are you? Who are you?

515
00:53:59,486 --> 00:54:01,977
Didn't you hear?
He's Erik Van Ostamgen.

516
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:05,253
He's not. Where is my husband?

517
00:54:05,558 --> 00:54:06,616
Where is Erik?

518
00:54:08,261 --> 00:54:11,753
I'll find out for myself.
Get out of my way...

519
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:13,427
Shut up.

520
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:16,626
- lf you don't shut up, I'll gag you.
- We'll have to tell her.

521
00:54:17,137 --> 00:54:18,434
Your husband is dead.

522
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,973
- It can't be true.
- I'm afraid it is.

523
00:54:27,047 --> 00:54:30,175
But how did he die? When?

524
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,875
As far as we know,
four months ago in an air raid.

525
00:54:33,053 --> 00:54:34,281
I see.

526
00:54:34,454 --> 00:54:37,787
You told the police you were
Erik Van Ostamgen. You're using his papers.

527
00:54:37,958 --> 00:54:39,687
You have my photograph.

528
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:42,151
Now I believe Erik is dead.

529
00:54:42,329 --> 00:54:43,853
And you've taken his place.

530
00:54:44,798 --> 00:54:47,665
Don't let her leave the room
or talk to anyone.

531
00:54:47,834 --> 00:54:50,564
I'll be back as soon as I can.

532
00:55:00,013 --> 00:55:01,878
Where is she going?

533
00:55:04,084 --> 00:55:06,143
What is she going to do?

534
00:55:07,821 --> 00:55:09,288
Open the door.

535
00:55:09,456 --> 00:55:11,048
I won't betray you, I swear it.

536
00:55:11,224 --> 00:55:13,385
I won't say a word to anyone.
Open the door.

537
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,118
I can't.

538
00:55:15,295 --> 00:55:17,024
But I must get back to my children.

539
00:55:17,197 --> 00:55:19,461
I can't let you go.

540
00:55:24,304 --> 00:55:27,034
I will never see them again, will I?

541
00:55:52,632 --> 00:55:56,193
I brought you something to eat.
You must be famished.

542
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:31,498
You might as well eat something.

543
00:56:48,188 --> 00:56:50,850
Well, then have something to drink.

544
00:56:55,028 --> 00:56:56,723
Now, tell me.

545
00:56:57,697 --> 00:56:59,426
What was your husband like?

546
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,294
Erik is dead.

547
00:57:01,468 --> 00:57:05,734
I know Erik is dead.
I need to know what he was like.

548
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:08,432
You want to know about Erik?

549
00:57:09,776 --> 00:57:12,609
Well, I want to know about you,
about the kind of man...

550
00:57:12,779 --> 00:57:15,907
...who would keep a woman locked
in a room away from her children...

551
00:57:16,082 --> 00:57:18,016
...when there are people
downstairs who...

552
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:20,209
You don't know
what they're doing downstairs.

553
00:57:20,386 --> 00:57:21,876
I do.

554
00:57:22,455 --> 00:57:25,515
She... She has made up her mind
to kill me.

555
00:57:26,226 --> 00:57:29,457
All right. Let's say she has.

556
00:57:29,629 --> 00:57:32,792
You walked into this. It's not my fault.

557
00:57:32,966 --> 00:57:35,799
You asked me before if you would
ever see your children again.

558
00:57:35,969 --> 00:57:37,834
I'll tell you the truth. You won't.

559
00:57:38,505 --> 00:57:41,599
Unless you can convince me
that I can trust you.

560
00:57:41,774 --> 00:57:44,436
And you'd stand by and let it happen.

561
00:57:44,611 --> 00:57:46,704
You are thinking of nothing
but your own life.

562
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:50,407
- Mine and others.
- What about mine and my children's?

563
00:57:50,583 --> 00:57:53,245
We don't matter as long
as you and that woman are safe.

564
00:57:53,419 --> 00:57:56,286
Look, I want to trust you.

565
00:57:56,456 --> 00:58:01,325
But I'm leaving. I've got to convince her.
It's as simple as that.

566
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:09,729
- Your husband worked for the Germans?
- Yes.

567
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,666
Willingly?

568
00:58:13,139 --> 00:58:15,835
Did he work willingly or was he forced?

569
00:58:17,977 --> 00:58:20,912
Erik believed he could get through life
without ever being hurt.

570
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:25,449
When the Germans came, the way
not to get hurt was to work for them.

571
00:58:25,618 --> 00:58:27,245
And you agreed?

572
00:58:29,189 --> 00:58:32,852
- Did you agree or didn't you?
- No.

573
00:58:33,026 --> 00:58:36,587
Is that why you got a divorce?
Or other reasons?

574
00:58:36,763 --> 00:58:38,890
I don't think the Gestapo
would question you...

575
00:58:39,065 --> 00:58:42,057
...about things which concern
my feelings, my thoughts.

576
00:58:44,904 --> 00:58:48,670
It's just talk, isn't it? To keep me quiet.

577
00:58:49,409 --> 00:58:52,674
Didn't they tell you in England
that Erik was a collaborator?

578
00:58:52,845 --> 00:58:53,834
No.

579
00:58:54,013 --> 00:58:56,607
That the Germans treated him
like one of themselves?

580
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:58,910
Perhaps I think the same way as he did.

581
00:58:59,085 --> 00:59:01,110
How can you really know?

582
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:04,620
Perhaps, after all, I have German friends.

583
00:59:05,892 --> 00:59:08,087
And you talk about
that woman trusting me.

584
00:59:08,261 --> 00:59:12,163
Listen, I'm trying to help you.

585
00:59:14,534 --> 00:59:17,094
That's wonderful.
That's really wonderful.

586
00:59:17,270 --> 00:59:19,795
You are always trying to help.

587
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,635
Well, maybe I could if you'd let me.

588
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:25,277
- I think there's a way out of this.
- Through the door.

589
00:59:25,445 --> 00:59:28,812
You have the key...
The key in your pocket.

590
00:59:35,355 --> 00:59:37,255
Do you have children?

591
00:59:37,624 --> 00:59:39,182
No.

592
00:59:39,859 --> 00:59:41,520
Are you married?

593
00:59:41,694 --> 00:59:43,184
No.

594
00:59:44,030 --> 00:59:46,692
Then it's easy to play the hero.

595
00:59:46,866 --> 00:59:48,561
How's Piet?

596
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,361
Oh, of course
you know my children's names.

597
00:59:52,538 --> 00:59:55,302
Yeah. I know as much as that.

598
00:59:58,411 --> 01:00:00,675
Oh, what's so funny?

599
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,576
You. You are funny.

600
01:00:02,749 --> 01:00:06,913
This awful room, the little waiter,
that dreadful woman downstairs.

601
01:00:07,086 --> 01:00:09,953
And you asking me about my children.

602
01:00:10,123 --> 01:00:12,683
You'd better come to your senses.

603
01:00:15,895 --> 01:00:18,796
Oh, I'm being perfectly sensible.

604
01:00:18,965 --> 01:00:22,059
I want you to let me out of this room.

605
01:00:23,002 --> 01:00:25,300
How can I convince you?

606
01:00:25,505 --> 01:00:28,235
How can I persuade you?

607
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,767
Can you be bribed?

608
01:00:30,977 --> 01:00:32,569
With money?

609
01:00:32,745 --> 01:00:34,474
I haven't got any.

610
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:37,138
But you've had enough to drink.

611
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:42,283
Come on. Come on.

612
01:00:55,368 --> 01:00:57,893
I'll try to find a way.

613
01:00:59,138 --> 01:01:01,333
I promise you I'll try.

614
01:01:02,975 --> 01:01:06,274
Erik was always making me promises.

615
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:09,139
I remember he promised...

616
01:01:09,349 --> 01:01:11,783
...to take me to Paris once.

617
01:01:11,951 --> 01:01:13,680
But he never did.

618
01:01:14,487 --> 01:01:17,513
He did take you to Capri
on your honeymoon, didn't he?

619
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:18,952
Yes.

620
01:01:20,660 --> 01:01:24,687
- Where do you live in Italy?
- Civitavecchia.

621
01:01:25,998 --> 01:01:29,024
Via Mazzina 19, Civitavecchia.

622
01:01:29,635 --> 01:01:31,398
Near Rome.

623
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,868
By the sea.

624
01:01:39,379 --> 01:01:42,109
You really don't have any choice.

625
01:01:42,715 --> 01:01:44,148
You may as well trust me.

626
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:54,286
I trust you.

627
01:05:57,937 --> 01:06:00,701
Dr. Engel? Dr. Engel?

628
01:06:04,110 --> 01:06:05,634
You're Dr. Engel?

629
01:06:07,413 --> 01:06:10,746
Yes, yes. In spite of every appearance
to the contrary.

630
01:06:11,017 --> 01:06:15,010
Oh, I'm sorry I'm rather scruffy.
I'm afraid I didn't have a very good journey.

631
01:06:15,187 --> 01:06:18,623
I landed in a hawthorn tree
and spent the night in a field of turnips.

632
01:06:18,791 --> 01:06:22,227
It was a bit uncomfortable.
However, I've got the documents.

633
01:06:22,395 --> 01:06:24,795
They've arrested Bijus.

634
01:06:24,964 --> 01:06:29,333
There's a chance they'll let him go.
They need engineers too badly.

635
01:06:29,502 --> 01:06:31,197
Hope you're right.

636
01:06:31,704 --> 01:06:34,036
Might as well have stayed at home.

637
01:06:34,206 --> 01:06:36,333
Nothing we can do.
I'll show you to your room.

638
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:40,169
- Will there be a police check?
- No.

639
01:06:40,346 --> 01:06:42,610
They've checked the passes.
They never come twice.

640
01:06:42,782 --> 01:06:45,273
And if they do, you're Engel.

641
01:06:45,551 --> 01:06:47,542
I'm not very well acquainted
with Dr. Engel.

642
01:06:47,720 --> 01:06:49,620
In fact, we're scarcely on nodding terms.

643
01:06:49,789 --> 01:06:52,417
- lf they ask any questions...
- Invent.

644
01:06:55,494 --> 01:06:59,260
London. Room 426, wasn't it?

645
01:06:59,432 --> 01:07:02,196
They turned me down.
Evidently, you were accepted.

646
01:07:02,368 --> 01:07:04,563
My congratulations.

647
01:07:05,738 --> 01:07:06,966
You're not Bijus.

648
01:07:07,139 --> 01:07:11,132
You're a petty officer
in the so-called Free Dutch Navy.

649
01:07:12,311 --> 01:07:13,676
We've known for a long time...

650
01:07:13,846 --> 01:07:17,043
...that Allied agents were being
planted in our underground factories.

651
01:07:17,683 --> 01:07:21,050
I was sent into England
to try and join one of these groups.

652
01:07:21,854 --> 01:07:24,379
And English.

653
01:07:24,623 --> 01:07:28,423
Now, tell me,
who are your contacts here?

654
01:07:28,594 --> 01:07:30,494
Who helped you get into Germany?

655
01:07:30,663 --> 01:07:33,757
How did you plan
to send information to England?

656
01:07:39,739 --> 01:07:43,300
Look, we can easily find out
who you really are.

657
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:46,912
You're obviously a qualified engineer.
Holland's a very small country.

658
01:07:47,079 --> 01:07:50,571
With a photograph,
we can identify you in a matter of days.

659
01:07:51,383 --> 01:07:54,409
Perhaps you have a family in Holland.

660
01:07:55,187 --> 01:07:58,054
You wouldn't like to have them sent
to a concentration camp.

661
01:08:01,026 --> 01:08:04,757
I'm not asking you
to betray your country.

662
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:06,420
You're a Dutchman. Good.

663
01:08:07,066 --> 01:08:10,399
There are millions in Holland
and occupied Europe working for the Reich.

664
01:08:10,569 --> 01:08:12,696
Do you think they're all wrong?

665
01:08:12,872 --> 01:08:14,396
You take my case, for example.

666
01:08:14,573 --> 01:08:16,131
I'm half English, half German.

667
01:08:16,308 --> 01:08:20,335
When the war came, I had to make up my
mind what I really believed, where I stood.

668
01:08:20,980 --> 01:08:23,448
Has it ever occurred to you
that you might be wrong...

669
01:08:23,616 --> 01:08:26,278
...and the Germans just might be right?

670
01:08:29,655 --> 01:08:32,249
Look what we've achieved
in the past 10 years.

671
01:08:32,424 --> 01:08:34,551
Before Hitler came to power,
we were nothing.

672
01:08:34,727 --> 01:08:40,529
Now we're the greatest nation in the world,
the most feared and the most respected.

673
01:08:41,567 --> 01:08:43,592
You understand, don't you?

674
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:46,167
I've only got to give the order...

675
01:08:46,338 --> 01:08:50,035
...and things would become
extremely unpleasant for you.

676
01:08:51,243 --> 01:08:55,043
On the other hand, if you cooperate,
I promise that you'll end this war alive...

677
01:08:55,214 --> 01:08:56,442
...and on the winning side.

678
01:08:56,615 --> 01:08:59,448
Because we are going to win the war,
I assure you.

679
01:08:59,852 --> 01:09:01,547
So, what's the trouble?

680
01:09:01,720 --> 01:09:04,052
What's holding you back?
I'd like to understand.

681
01:09:11,797 --> 01:09:14,322
You're a very silly young man.

682
01:09:22,208 --> 01:09:23,869
Here, you have this.

683
01:09:51,237 --> 01:09:53,432
Sordid, isn't it?

684
01:09:53,806 --> 01:09:57,105
Not one of history's immortal moments.

685
01:09:57,910 --> 01:10:00,242
And unnecessary. You proved your point.

686
01:10:00,412 --> 01:10:04,007
You're a very brave man.
I have the greatest admiration for you.

687
01:10:04,683 --> 01:10:06,844
But it's all wasted.

688
01:10:07,019 --> 01:10:10,284
The war will go on.
The outcome will be just the same...

689
01:10:10,623 --> 01:10:12,716
...only you'll be dead...

690
01:10:13,259 --> 01:10:15,784
...and no one will even know
how you died.

691
01:10:15,961 --> 01:10:20,489
For God's sake, man,
don't throw your life away for nothing.

692
01:11:08,213 --> 01:11:11,205
- Could I have a word with you, please?
- Of course.

693
01:11:19,014 --> 01:11:22,711
I just got a message. The trucks will be here
any moment. Here are your papers.

694
01:11:23,018 --> 01:11:26,954
We have to be careful. It may be some time
before anybody gets in touch with you.

695
01:11:27,123 --> 01:11:30,786
Here they are. Now, don't worry
about the girl. I'll take care of her.

696
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,450
You don't have to.

697
01:11:32,628 --> 01:11:34,323
We can trust her, we can let her go.

698
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:36,830
Trust her? How can you be sure?

699
01:11:37,733 --> 01:11:39,633
I know what I'm doing.

700
01:11:46,375 --> 01:11:49,037
Give me that document
about your children.

701
01:11:50,045 --> 01:11:54,175
This document gives Frau Van Ostamgen
permission to take her children to Italy.

702
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:57,183
- That's why you came here, isn't it?
- That's all I care about.

703
01:11:57,353 --> 01:11:59,651
To get safely home with my children.

704
01:12:05,961 --> 01:12:08,327
I can forge his signature perfectly.

705
01:12:09,398 --> 01:12:11,366
I'll date it today.

706
01:12:14,670 --> 01:12:17,230
Once she's on her way home,
she can't tell the police...

707
01:12:17,406 --> 01:12:20,375
...her husband died four months ago
and betray us, can she?

708
01:12:21,477 --> 01:12:23,104
Would you like to witness it?

709
01:12:23,279 --> 01:12:25,042
With pleasure.

710
01:14:07,182 --> 01:14:10,117
You must tell everyone
that you've seen Erik and he's well.

711
01:14:23,599 --> 01:14:26,159
- Erik Van Ostamgen?
- Nora Van Ostamgen.

712
01:15:26,161 --> 01:15:27,924
Van Ostamgen.

713
01:16:10,973 --> 01:16:12,964
I won't be long.

714
01:25:48,316 --> 01:25:49,749
Sims.

715
01:25:49,918 --> 01:25:51,215
Remember this?

716
01:25:51,386 --> 01:25:52,876
Yes, I remember. Drains.

717
01:25:53,054 --> 01:25:56,080
- I wonder if it could be something else.
- What makes you say that?

718
01:25:56,257 --> 01:25:59,818
Well, this is new cover. The same
construction, but there's something on it.

719
01:25:59,995 --> 01:26:01,326
- Where?
- To the left.

720
01:26:01,496 --> 01:26:03,555
It looks like a midget aircraft.

721
01:26:03,732 --> 01:26:05,427
Yes, it could be a very small plane.

722
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,693
Let us see what Kendall thinks.

723
01:26:07,936 --> 01:26:10,700
It's the PM.
They're just putting him through.

724
01:26:13,208 --> 01:26:17,076
I thought I should tell you at once
that we've found out what the ski sites are.

725
01:26:17,245 --> 01:26:18,542
They're not for rockets.

726
01:26:18,713 --> 01:26:22,274
We think they're for a kind
of flying bomb.

727
01:26:38,566 --> 01:26:41,626
Altogether, we've destroyed
a hundred of these ski sites up to now.

728
01:26:41,803 --> 01:26:45,204
We're bombing them continuously.
The Americans by day, and we by night.

729
01:26:45,373 --> 01:26:47,898
As soon as we knock them down,
they put up new ones.

730
01:26:48,076 --> 01:26:51,341
They're prefabricated. They can stick them
together in no time at all.

731
01:26:51,513 --> 01:26:52,810
What are you worried about?

732
01:26:52,981 --> 01:26:55,643
Nothing happened when the invasion
buildup was going on.

733
01:26:55,817 --> 01:26:58,183
And I can think
of no more tempting target.

734
01:26:58,353 --> 01:26:59,684
Now we've landed in France...

735
01:26:59,854 --> 01:27:03,756
...and we still haven't had any sign
of your mythical secret weapon.

736
01:27:03,925 --> 01:27:06,655
I believe that the reason
we haven't seen them up to now...

737
01:27:06,828 --> 01:27:09,991
...is because our efforts
succeeded in delaying them.

738
01:27:10,832 --> 01:27:14,928
But they could still do tremendous damage
if they get them off the ground in numbers.

739
01:27:15,103 --> 01:27:17,936
Is Hitler waiting to produce them
at the peace conference?

740
01:27:18,306 --> 01:27:20,467
Despite your opposition...

741
01:27:20,642 --> 01:27:24,635
...which I'm sure is quite sincere,
I'm certain we've done the right thing.

742
01:27:25,046 --> 01:27:28,038
Yes, hold on. It's Fighter Command.

743
01:27:30,819 --> 01:27:32,343
Sandys.

744
01:27:37,726 --> 01:27:39,284
I see.

745
01:27:42,764 --> 01:27:46,325
Channel observation posts
report that flying objects...

746
01:27:46,735 --> 01:27:49,295
...with a tail of fire...

747
01:27:49,571 --> 01:27:53,007
...are passing over Dover
and heading towards London.

748
01:27:54,909 --> 01:27:58,345
Speed over 400 miles an hour.

749
01:29:13,221 --> 01:29:14,483
Over here!

750
01:29:14,656 --> 01:29:17,056
- Get them first aid over there.
- Watch the pressure.

751
01:29:17,225 --> 01:29:20,058
Come along. It's all right, it's all right.

752
01:29:46,621 --> 01:29:49,954
- <i>Breaking now. You have a go.</i>
- <i>Roger.</i>

753
01:29:53,995 --> 01:29:56,088
<i>Missed the bastard.</i>

754
01:30:15,416 --> 01:30:17,213
Why not move the guns down here...

755
01:30:17,385 --> 01:30:19,785
...stick them in a line
from Beachy Head to Dover?

756
01:30:19,954 --> 01:30:23,583
Then your fighters would be free to operate
behind them over Kent and Sussex...

757
01:30:23,758 --> 01:30:27,194
...up to the balloons in the suburbs.
- It's a good idea, I agree.

758
01:30:27,362 --> 01:30:29,990
But it means moving a thousand guns,
20,000 personnel...

759
01:30:30,164 --> 01:30:32,189
...and miles and miles of electric cable.

760
01:30:32,367 --> 01:30:36,098
I must point out that it will leave London
defenseless for several days.

761
01:30:36,271 --> 01:30:39,502
In any case, what about the chiefs of staff?
They'll never agree.

762
01:30:39,674 --> 01:30:42,438
Well, we'll ask them afterwards,
shall we?

763
01:31:08,603 --> 01:31:11,037
There aren't quite as many over tonight.

764
01:31:11,372 --> 01:31:15,866
Just as well, with a thousand guns
on their way to the seaside...

765
01:31:27,622 --> 01:31:30,420
Mind you, it's tomorrow
I'm worried about.

766
01:31:30,591 --> 01:31:34,584
If German Intelligence is up to the mark,
they'll send everything they've got.

767
01:31:34,762 --> 01:31:38,027
Yes, well, with luck,
they'll only think about it tomorrow.

768
01:31:38,533 --> 01:31:41,593
And the day after tomorrow,
we'll be ready for them.

769
01:31:42,403 --> 01:31:43,893
I hope so.

770
01:32:26,447 --> 01:32:27,778
That's more like it.

771
01:33:00,715 --> 01:33:03,240
Somebody's contacted me at last.

772
01:33:03,418 --> 01:33:08,219
Good. V-2, gyroscope controls.
Speed, 3000.

773
01:33:10,425 --> 01:33:13,292
And they're testing a new one,
long-range.

774
01:33:13,461 --> 01:33:14,792
How long?

775
01:33:14,962 --> 01:33:17,294
They call it the New York rocket.

776
01:36:14,675 --> 01:36:17,075
All right, give me the kid, love.
I'll take him.

777
01:36:17,245 --> 01:36:20,146
Come on. It's all right, son.
You'll be all right, come on.

778
01:36:29,557 --> 01:36:31,422
- Steady that.
- All right.

779
01:36:32,193 --> 01:36:34,286
Bring him this way. This way.

780
01:36:36,631 --> 01:36:39,327
Come on, now. Got him now.

781
01:36:42,937 --> 01:36:45,235
Get him to the stretcher over here.

782
01:36:45,406 --> 01:36:46,873
- Bring him this way.
- Coming.

783
01:37:50,438 --> 01:37:54,704
This morning, we have proof that
the V-2 rockets have no launching sites.

784
01:37:54,875 --> 01:37:56,809
They've learnt by their mistakes.

785
01:37:56,977 --> 01:37:59,605
For the flying bombs,
they had to have elaborate ramps.

786
01:37:59,780 --> 01:38:04,080
They built them fast,
and we destroyed them almost as fast.

787
01:38:04,251 --> 01:38:08,244
For the firing of the V-2,
they've invented a huge trailer.

788
01:38:08,689 --> 01:38:13,991
They can transport their rocket
and launch it from the same vehicle.

789
01:38:14,161 --> 01:38:17,597
The only hope of stopping them
is if a plane happens to pass overhead...

790
01:38:17,765 --> 01:38:20,131
...when the rocket's erected,
just before firing.

791
01:38:20,301 --> 01:38:21,734
That's a million-to-one chance.

792
01:38:21,902 --> 01:38:25,099
Yea, and even then, it would hardly
provide a target for attack...

793
01:38:25,272 --> 01:38:26,603
...if the sites are mobile.

794
01:38:26,774 --> 01:38:29,937
Quite. So we've got to destroy them
where they're made.

795
01:38:30,111 --> 01:38:31,339
Very difficult.

796
01:38:31,512 --> 01:38:34,743
The factory's been moved underground.
Perfectly camouflaged.

797
01:38:35,082 --> 01:38:39,212
There's more to it than that.
I've got some men inside.

798
01:38:39,387 --> 01:38:43,050
Apparently, the Germans
are about to start testing a new rocket...

799
01:38:43,224 --> 01:38:45,158
...with a much longer range.

800
01:38:45,326 --> 01:38:48,454
So that even after we've liberated
the occupied countries...

801
01:38:48,629 --> 01:38:51,723
...they could still fire at us
from the heart of Germany.

802
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:55,691
We'll have to lay on a full-scale raid.

803
01:38:56,203 --> 01:38:59,969
Let your men know when it's going to be
so they can try sabotage at the same time.

804
01:39:00,141 --> 01:39:01,699
We've gotta try everything.

805
01:39:01,876 --> 01:39:03,867
Bombing and sabotage.

806
01:39:42,716 --> 01:39:46,914
There's an air raid
tomorrow night, 11:30.

807
01:39:47,087 --> 01:39:49,521
They're after the long-range rocket.

808
01:39:50,224 --> 01:39:52,920
Don't they know
it's 80 feet down in solid rock?

809
01:39:53,093 --> 01:39:54,492
No.

810
01:39:54,762 --> 01:39:57,356
And they want us to pinpoint it for them.

811
01:39:57,932 --> 01:40:01,595
- Can you open the launching-pit doors?
- No.

812
01:40:02,503 --> 01:40:05,472
No, we always phone the Power House.
They pull the switch.

813
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:07,834
Have we got anybody in there?

814
01:40:08,409 --> 01:40:09,967
No.

815
01:40:27,528 --> 01:40:29,962
We'll have to get in
and pull the switch ourselves.

816
01:40:30,130 --> 01:40:31,722
You know the switch?

817
01:40:31,899 --> 01:40:34,834
No. Can you find out?

818
01:40:35,703 --> 01:40:37,330
I think so.

819
01:40:38,172 --> 01:40:40,265
We still have to get in there.

820
01:40:41,742 --> 01:40:44,609
My pass will get us past most guards.

821
01:40:44,778 --> 01:40:48,908
As soon as he opens the door,
we'll jump him and grab his gun.

822
01:40:49,884 --> 01:40:51,715
Just like that?

823
01:40:53,087 --> 01:40:55,078
Bit thin, isn't it?

824
01:40:55,556 --> 01:40:57,217
Yeah.

825
01:40:57,391 --> 01:40:59,416
Can you think of anything else?

826
01:41:01,762 --> 01:41:03,195
No.

827
01:41:07,735 --> 01:41:09,600
What time shall we meet?

828
01:41:10,604 --> 01:41:14,904
Eleven twenty-five.
Assembly plant. Passage C.

829
01:41:18,579 --> 01:41:20,069
Good morning.

830
01:42:20,107 --> 01:42:21,597
Van Ostamgen.

831
01:43:36,350 --> 01:43:40,013
Van Ordern, Van Osten, Van Ostamgen.

832
01:45:27,528 --> 01:45:30,258
- Right. I've got the switch number.
- Good. Let's go.

833
01:46:14,741 --> 01:46:16,208
Right. Door.

834
01:46:19,112 --> 01:46:20,704
Curtis!

835
01:48:14,027 --> 01:48:15,358
How long to target?

836
01:48:15,529 --> 01:48:16,826
Two minutes, skipper.

837
01:48:32,946 --> 01:48:34,243
Van Ostamgen...

838
01:48:35,482 --> 01:48:38,713
<i>... or whatever your real name is,</i>
<i>listen to me.</i>

839
01:48:38,885 --> 01:48:40,716
<i>We've got your friend here.</i>

840
01:48:43,023 --> 01:48:46,186
<i>I'm going to give you one minute</i>
<i>to come out...</i>

841
01:48:46,360 --> 01:48:50,854
<i>... or he'll be shot.</i>
<i>Do you understand? Killed.</i>

842
01:48:56,803 --> 01:49:00,864
Now, I'm giving you
exactly one minute from...

843
01:49:02,009 --> 01:49:03,601
...now.

844
01:49:25,932 --> 01:49:28,833
Can you see anything<i>?</i>
They're supposed to show us a light.

845
01:49:34,541 --> 01:49:35,974
Can't see a bloody thing.

846
01:49:40,447 --> 01:49:42,108
Thirty seconds.

847
01:49:49,689 --> 01:49:51,316
<i>Fifteen.</i>

848
01:50:00,634 --> 01:50:02,124
Ten seconds.

849
01:50:15,615 --> 01:50:16,946
Switch R9.

850
01:50:17,150 --> 01:50:18,139
<i>R9.</i>

851
01:50:50,817 --> 01:50:51,875
Halt.

852
01:51:01,328 --> 01:51:03,057
Still can't see anything.

853
01:51:03,230 --> 01:51:05,198
<i>How about you?</i>

854
01:51:06,199 --> 01:51:08,997
No. Nothing, skipper.

855
01:51:56,983 --> 01:51:58,575
What's that?

856
01:51:58,752 --> 01:52:01,744
- Where?
- <i>A bit to starboard.</i>

857
01:52:07,160 --> 01:52:09,094
That's it. That's the target.

858
01:52:09,429 --> 01:52:10,987
Stand by.

859
01:52:55,542 --> 01:52:58,477
Right. Right.

860
01:53:23,637 --> 01:53:24,899
Steady!

861
01:54:58,698 --> 01:55:01,394
I've been reading your final report
on Operation Crossbow.

862
01:55:04,070 --> 01:55:07,836
- It was a vital task and a job well done.
- Thank you.

863
01:55:08,475 --> 01:55:12,309
But we owe so much to the bravery
of our agents, many of whose names...

864
01:55:12,479 --> 01:55:15,414
...will never be known.
- Yes, and to the RAF.

865
01:55:15,582 --> 01:55:20,212
If Hitler's rocket plans hadn't been
totally upset by our raid on Peenemünde...

866
01:55:20,387 --> 01:55:22,617
...London would have been devastated.

867
01:55:22,789 --> 01:55:25,314
But it's time we began
to think about reconstruction...

868
01:55:25,492 --> 01:55:27,483
...and I want you
to be minister of works.

869
01:55:27,660 --> 01:55:32,597
With thousands of buildings destroyed by
bombs and rockets, it's an enormous task.

870
01:55:33,633 --> 01:55:35,464
<i>Let us start at once.</i>

871
01:55:35,635 --> 01:55:38,502
<i>Let us clear the rubble</i>
<i>and lay the bricks...</i>

872
01:55:38,671 --> 01:55:43,370
<i>... and let us do so in the firm conviction</i>
<i>that we are building for the future...</i>

873
01:55:43,743 --> 01:55:46,906
<i>... that never again shall we have to embark</i>
<i>upon such a conflict...</i>

874
01:55:47,080 --> 01:55:49,275
<i>... as we recently endured.</i>

875
01:55:49,449 --> 01:55:52,816
<i>I solemnly believe</i>
<i>that the price of such a folly...</i>

876
01:55:52,986 --> 01:55:57,116
<i>... would be far more than mankind</i>
<i>could afford to pay.</i>

877
01:56:16,209 --> 01:56:18,177
