(<i>hooves clattering</i>)

2
00:01:16,406 --> 00:01:17,839
Man:
Captain Pellew.

3
00:01:17,908 --> 00:01:19,205
Come in, Sir.

4
00:01:20,410 --> 00:01:21,843
My apologies
for requiring you

5
00:01:21,912 --> 00:01:22,936
at such short notice.

6
00:01:23,013 --> 00:01:24,002
Not at all, my lord.

7
00:01:24,081 --> 00:01:27,346
Captain Pellew,
may I introduce

8
00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:29,214
General the Baron
de Charette

9
00:01:29,286 --> 00:01:33,086
commander in chief of
His Majesty King Louis'
army in exile.

10
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:36,482
The general is going
to invade France...

11
00:01:38,762 --> 00:01:40,491
and we're going
to help him.

12
00:01:56,547 --> 00:01:59,744
Once your ships
have carried us
across the channel

13
00:01:59,816 --> 00:02:02,148
We shall raise
an army of the people

14
00:02:02,219 --> 00:02:03,811
and march on Paris

15
00:02:03,887 --> 00:02:08,324
to restore His most
Catholic Majesty
to the throne.

16
00:02:08,392 --> 00:02:09,586
May I ask, Sir

17
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,458
how many men you
expect to raise

18
00:02:12,529 --> 00:02:14,019
for this... army?

19
00:02:14,097 --> 00:02:15,724
Within a matter of days

20
00:02:15,799 --> 00:02:19,496
I shall have, uh, 10,000,
maybe 20,000 men in arms.

21
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,003
Then we shall move east

22
00:02:21,071 --> 00:02:23,039
gathering more as we go.

23
00:02:23,106 --> 00:02:27,566
Never doubt the loyatty
of the people, monsieur.

24
00:02:35,419 --> 00:02:36,545
(<i>gasps</i>)

25
00:02:39,623 --> 00:02:43,616
(<i>scissors snipping</i>)

26
00:02:48,565 --> 00:02:50,556
I understand, sir, that in fact

27
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:54,400
arms have been raised against
the rebel government before.

28
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:56,234
Certainly, many times.

29
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:58,274
Without any success.

30
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,973
Captain Pellew

31
00:03:02,045 --> 00:03:04,172
for five years
I have lived in exile

32
00:03:04,247 --> 00:03:08,411
(<i>spews</i>):
While traitors have
laid waste to my country.

33
00:03:08,485 --> 00:03:12,114
Well, now the nobility
of France is going home

34
00:03:12,189 --> 00:03:15,625
and this time,
when my countrymen fight

35
00:03:15,692 --> 00:03:19,184
we, their rightful leaders,
will lead them into battle.

36
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:23,995
Can I not take it, sir

37
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:26,695
that we have your support
in this great venture?

38
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,034
Hood:
Oh, yes, Baron

39
00:03:29,106 --> 00:03:33,509
you can depend on Captain
Pellew's full support.

40
00:03:33,577 --> 00:03:37,069
You have His Britannic
Majesty's word on it.

41
00:03:41,284 --> 00:03:43,377
(<i>coughs</i>)

42
00:03:43,453 --> 00:03:46,980
(<i>dog barks in background</i>)

43
00:03:47,057 --> 00:03:49,252
(<i>coughs</i>)

44
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:58,963
How do I look?

45
00:03:59,036 --> 00:04:02,096
The most startling
improvement, if I
may say so, sir.

46
00:04:10,547 --> 00:04:15,143
(<i>panting</i>)

47
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:18,585
So with two shirts, hat,
breeches, buttons and buckles

48
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:20,145
the sum is £11

49
00:04:20,223 --> 00:04:22,054
nine shillings
and threepence.

50
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,456
Ah.

51
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:26,291
Perhaps pinchbeck
instead of silver

52
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:27,352
for the shoe buckles?

53
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:28,762
That would make it,
um...

54
00:04:28,832 --> 00:04:30,959
shall we say £11 even?

55
00:04:31,034 --> 00:04:33,730
Very well, Mr. Collins.

56
00:04:33,804 --> 00:04:37,672
Hood:
I assure you, the baron
is still a figurehead

57
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:39,971
amongst those
loyal to King Louis.

58
00:04:40,043 --> 00:04:41,840
His name will
provide the spark

59
00:04:41,912 --> 00:04:43,743
sets all northern
France afire.

60
00:04:43,814 --> 00:04:45,338
But the royalist
force, my lord?

61
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:46,382
They're nothing more

62
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:48,247
than the remnants
of a defeated army.

63
00:04:48,318 --> 00:04:50,343
A final cast
of the dice,
I grant you.

64
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,251
Indeed, sir,
and a desperate one.

65
00:04:52,322 --> 00:04:54,517
Ah, you forget
what is at stake,
Sir Edward.

66
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:55,819
For the cost
of ferrying

67
00:04:55,892 --> 00:04:57,257
General Charette
and his men

68
00:04:57,327 --> 00:04:58,259
across the channel

69
00:04:58,328 --> 00:05:01,559
we can put an end to
the war with France.

70
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:04,031
Surely, even in
your estimation

71
00:05:04,101 --> 00:05:07,764
it's a trifling effort
for a place in history.

72
00:05:07,838 --> 00:05:10,432
Yes, but if
the expedition
should fail, sir

73
00:05:10,507 --> 00:05:12,099
what of the cost in lives?

74
00:05:12,175 --> 00:05:14,973
Men die every day
this war continues.

75
00:05:15,045 --> 00:05:16,307
When it's over

76
00:05:16,379 --> 00:05:19,109
we may count costs
at our leisure.

77
00:05:19,182 --> 00:05:22,709
(<i>man groaning</i>)

78
00:05:22,786 --> 00:05:25,880
Make way.
Make way.

79
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:27,014
(<i>gasping</i>)

80
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,819
My lord, my lord.

81
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:29,620
Speak up, man!

82
00:05:29,693 --> 00:05:30,751
The orders!

83
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:31,919
Well?

84
00:05:33,063 --> 00:05:34,997
(<i>gasps</i>)

85
00:05:35,065 --> 00:05:36,657
Gone, my lord.

86
00:05:36,733 --> 00:05:38,223
Pox on them.

87
00:05:38,301 --> 00:05:40,070
(<i>men whispering</i>)

88
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,935
My lord?

89
00:05:42,005 --> 00:05:45,805
He was carrying a copy
of General Charette's plan

90
00:05:45,876 --> 00:05:47,275
to the first lord.

91
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:49,938
Oh, my God.

92
00:05:50,013 --> 00:05:51,981
What if they fall
into enemy hands?

93
00:05:52,048 --> 00:05:53,538
Well, we do not
know that.

94
00:05:53,617 --> 00:05:55,881
They may be at
the bottom of the Thames.

95
00:05:55,952 --> 00:05:57,647
The thieves drunk
in a tavern.

96
00:05:57,721 --> 00:05:59,848
Sir, what if they're not?

97
00:05:59,923 --> 00:06:03,359
His Majesty's government
has decided

98
00:06:03,426 --> 00:06:06,793
and they are not in the business
of changing their minds.

99
00:06:06,863 --> 00:06:09,024
Should General Charette
know of this?

100
00:06:09,099 --> 00:06:12,535
I don't believe there's
any need to trouble him.

101
00:06:12,602 --> 00:06:16,299
What has passed here
will remain between ourselves.

102
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:18,136
Is that understood?

103
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:19,971
(<i>man gasping</i>)

104
00:06:20,043 --> 00:06:21,806
Yes, sir.

105
00:06:21,878 --> 00:06:24,779
However, since it
would not be politic

106
00:06:24,848 --> 00:06:27,112
for King Louis to think

107
00:06:27,184 --> 00:06:30,847
that we might have cast
his general ashore unaided

108
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:32,718
you will remain
on station

109
00:06:32,789 --> 00:06:35,257
after the general
has disembarked.

110
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:37,122
And if worse comes to worst

111
00:06:37,194 --> 00:06:40,061
you can provide him
with a means of escape.

112
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,722
As you wish, sir.

113
00:06:41,798 --> 00:06:43,390
Very well.

114
00:06:43,466 --> 00:06:46,060
You have your orders,
Captain Pellew.

115
00:06:46,136 --> 00:06:47,262
Carry on, sir.

116
00:06:56,513 --> 00:07:00,381
(<i>hooves clattering past</i>)

117

Mr. Hornblower.

00:07:01,618 --> 00:07:02,710
Sir.

119
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:04,481
Well, don't stand
there dawdling, sir.

120
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:06,784
We must return to Plymouth
as soon as possible.

Go on.

00:07:54,271 --> 00:07:57,536

Welcome aboard, sir.

126
00:08:09,085 --> 00:08:11,610
A profitable meeting
at the admiratty,
I trust?

127
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:14,122
Quite satisfactory,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

128
00:08:14,190 --> 00:08:17,626
Signal the ships <i>Dumbarton,</i>
<i>Sophia</i> and <i>Catherine</i>

129
00:08:17,694 --> 00:08:20,424
and request the attendance
of their captains in one hour.

130
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:23,057
Mr. Hornblower, my compliments
to the senior officers.

131
00:08:23,133 --> 00:08:25,124
I will see them
in my cabin in 20 minutes.

132
00:08:25,201 --> 00:08:26,634
Aye, sir.

133
00:08:26,703 --> 00:08:29,797
So, Mr. Hornblower,
what news?

134
00:08:29,873 --> 00:08:32,307
I know no more than you,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

135
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:36,141
Well, I expect
we shall find out.

136
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:37,270
By the way, I think

137
00:08:37,347 --> 00:08:39,042
you have a splash
of mud on your jacket.

138
00:08:39,115 --> 00:08:40,514
Ah, ha-ha.

139
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,882
You look every inch
the new lieutenant,
Mr. Hornblower.

140
00:08:43,954 --> 00:08:45,353
Long may it remain so.

(<i>general conversation</i>)

142
00:08:52,662 --> 00:08:54,129
Gentlemen,
captain's compliments

143
00:08:54,197 --> 00:08:56,825
and he will see all officers
in his cabin in 20 minutes.

Kennedy:
What? Who's this?

145
00:08:58,168 --> 00:08:59,692
Gentlemen,
it appears

146
00:08:59,769 --> 00:09:01,760
we have a stranger
in our midst.

147
00:09:01,838 --> 00:09:04,204
No, no...
I'm mistaken.

148
00:09:04,274 --> 00:09:06,674
It's Lieutenant
Hornblower

149
00:09:06,743 --> 00:09:09,337
from top to toe
a new man.

150

(<i>ship's bell rings</i>)

151
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:13,515
And not a patch in sight.

152
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:16,518
Indeed it is,
acting Lieutenant Kennedy.

153
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:18,417
Gentlemen, it appears
that Mr. Hornblower

154
00:09:18,488 --> 00:09:19,455
is now the standard

155
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:21,353
by which we must all
measure ourselves.

156
00:09:21,424 --> 00:09:23,619
All right, all right,
that's enough.

157
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:25,092
Thank you, Mr. Bowles.

Oi! Watch it.

159

What do you reckon

160
00:09:31,801 --> 00:09:33,530
the orders will be,
then, eh?

161
00:09:33,603 --> 00:09:35,195
Stay here
and take it easy.

162

Not unless
the captain's gone soft.

I could just do
with another month
on fresh rations.

165
00:09:42,045 --> 00:09:44,104
Maybe we'll be sent
to the Indies, eh?

166
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,112
How about that?

167
00:09:45,181 --> 00:09:46,409
Palm trees, sunshine.

171

Yeah, we
could go back

Do it on our own,
too.

Leave the rest
of the fleet

(<i>all laughing</i>)

180
00:10:18,348 --> 00:10:20,612
Gentlemen,
as you are no doubt aware

181
00:10:20,683 --> 00:10:24,346
I have lately returned from
a meeting with Admiral Hood.

182
00:10:24,421 --> 00:10:27,254
Our orders are
to join the ships

183
00:10:27,323 --> 00:10:30,190
<i>Catherine,</i>
<i>Dumbarton</i> and <i>Sophia</i>

184
00:10:30,260 --> 00:10:32,091
and convey
a General Charette

185
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:33,459
together with forces

186
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,862
comprising of French
royalist troops

187
00:10:35,932 --> 00:10:37,866
and British infantry

188
00:10:37,934 --> 00:10:40,801
to the coast of France.

189
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,132
An invasion, sir?

190
00:10:42,205 --> 00:10:43,467
Mr. Kennedy, four ships

191
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:45,838
could hardly constitute
an invasion, sir.

192
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:47,069
Then what is the point, sir?

193
00:10:47,143 --> 00:10:48,110
The point, Mr. Bowles

194
00:10:48,178 --> 00:10:49,736
is that we are at war, sir.

195
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:52,338
And when at war, we react
to an order without hesitation.

196
00:10:52,415 --> 00:10:55,213
(<i>gulls cawing</i>)

197
00:10:55,285 --> 00:10:59,312
Um... I understand, gentlemen

198
00:10:59,389 --> 00:11:02,688
this plan may seem
somewhat... cavalier.

199
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,286
However, it is
the general's plan,
once landed

200
00:11:06,362 --> 00:11:09,490
to raise an army
with which to march on Paris

201
00:11:09,566 --> 00:11:12,000
and place King Louis
on the throne.

202
00:11:12,068 --> 00:11:13,660
That would mean an end
to the war, sir.

203
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:15,727
I believe that is
the intention, Mr. Bracegirdle.

204
00:11:15,805 --> 00:11:16,965
Sir, are we permitted
to know

205
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:18,837
where the general's troops
will be landing?

206
00:11:18,908 --> 00:11:20,671
No, our destination
will remain secret

207
00:11:20,743 --> 00:11:22,904
until we set sail,
and then there is no chance

208
00:11:22,979 --> 00:11:25,038
of word reaching the French
until we arrive.

209
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:28,050
In the meantime,
I want all dispatch
in the loading

210

of the general's men

211
00:11:29,752 --> 00:11:30,684

can see to the embarkation

I will see to it myself.

Excellent.

238
00:13:21,364 --> 00:13:23,423
Your men look
very fine, Major.

Almost too good
for battle.

00:18:38,347 --> 00:18:39,211
Styles:
Understand?

326
00:18:39,282 --> 00:18:40,579
Oldroyd! What's going on here?

327
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:43,050
Ah, this bugger
was after pinching
this chicken, sir.

328
00:18:43,119 --> 00:18:44,416
They're the officer's
chickens

329
00:18:44,487 --> 00:18:45,784
and we caught
him red-handed.

330
00:18:45,855 --> 00:18:47,322
Stealing is an
hanging offense, sir.

331
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:49,221
Yes, Matthews, I'm aware
of that, thank you.

332
00:18:49,292 --> 00:18:51,226
Ha! Well, it's the rope
for you then, frog.

333
00:18:51,294 --> 00:18:52,955
However, this man
may <i>not</i> be.

334
00:18:53,029 --> 00:18:54,621
Has anyone taken
the trouble

335
00:18:54,697 --> 00:18:57,530
of explaining messing
arrangement to these men?

336
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,727
Not as such, sir.

337
00:19:01,437 --> 00:19:02,461
<i>Allez vous en.</i>

338
00:19:02,538 --> 00:19:03,937
Let him go!

339
00:19:08,077 --> 00:19:09,408
You're letting
him go, sir?

340
00:19:09,478 --> 00:19:10,911
Styles, these people
are our guests

341
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,447
and as such,
you will extend to them

342
00:19:12,515 --> 00:19:14,608
every courtesy and kindness
while they're aboard.

343
00:19:16,385 --> 00:19:19,047
Well, I mean,
playing piggyback
with the frogs, sir.

344
00:19:19,121 --> 00:19:20,486
The frog is the enemy, sir.

345
00:19:20,556 --> 00:19:21,784
Not these frogs, Styles.

346
00:19:21,857 --> 00:19:23,154
These are the good frogs.

347
00:19:23,225 --> 00:19:24,590
A frog is a frog, sir.

348
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:27,356
And the only good frog
is a dead frog, sir.

349
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,796
This'll end badly,
Mr. Hornblower, sir.

350
00:19:29,865 --> 00:19:30,957
You mark my words.

351
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:33,627
All right, that's enough!

352
00:19:33,703 --> 00:19:34,863
Now about your work.

353
00:19:34,937 --> 00:19:36,837
Aye aye, sir.

354
00:19:40,309 --> 00:19:41,776
Styles.

355
00:19:41,844 --> 00:19:44,074
Sir?

356
00:19:44,146 --> 00:19:45,909
Put the chicken back, Styles.

357
00:19:48,718 --> 00:19:49,650
But, sir...

358
00:19:49,719 --> 00:19:51,653
Styles!

359
00:19:53,489 --> 00:19:54,956
Yes, sir.

360
00:19:58,594 --> 00:20:01,586
(<i>knocking on door</i>)

361
00:20:01,664 --> 00:20:03,393
Come.

362
00:20:03,466 --> 00:20:05,866
Hornblower:
Report from the
quarterdeck, sir.

363
00:20:05,935 --> 00:20:07,630
Wind still
from the north,
course steady.

364
00:20:07,703 --> 00:20:08,829
Thank you, Mr. Hornblower.

365
00:20:10,106 --> 00:20:12,006
Mr. Hornblower?

366
00:20:12,074 --> 00:20:13,006
Sir?

367
00:20:13,075 --> 00:20:15,976
A word, if you please.

368
00:20:18,948 --> 00:20:23,044
How are the men taking to their
new traveling companions?

369
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,552
As one might expect, sir.

370
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:27,350
They have a few misgivings
about their presence

371
00:20:27,423 --> 00:20:28,651
but nothing untoward.

372
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:30,624
Misgivings?
What kind of misgivings?

373
00:20:30,693 --> 00:20:32,593
I think they have
a little difficutty

374
00:20:32,662 --> 00:20:34,721
in seeing the general's
troops as allies

375
00:20:34,797 --> 00:20:37,322
when only yesterday
any Frenchman was the enemy.

376
00:20:37,400 --> 00:20:38,697
You have made it clear

377
00:20:38,768 --> 00:20:40,429
they must give the general
their full support?

378
00:20:40,503 --> 00:20:41,731
Oh, yes, sir, very clear.

379
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:44,666
Good, good.

380
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,077
And yourself?

381
00:20:49,145 --> 00:20:54,481
What do you, um, think of the
general and, uh, his plan?

382
00:20:56,752 --> 00:20:59,414
I think he is bold, sir.

383
00:20:59,488 --> 00:21:00,716
Bold?

384
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:02,223
Is that all?

385
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:05,988
Without knowing either the
general or his plan in detail

386
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:08,189
I wouldn't presume
to judge, sir.

387
00:21:08,264 --> 00:21:10,562
Oh, a prudent enough answer.

388
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:14,831
There is also some speculation
about our destination, sir.

389
00:21:14,904 --> 00:21:17,134
What would you say
if I were to tell you

390
00:21:17,206 --> 00:21:19,606
we were heading
for the coast of Brittany?

391
00:21:19,675 --> 00:21:23,076
What would be
your guess then?

392
00:21:23,145 --> 00:21:26,046
In that case, I would say
Quiberon Bay, sir.

393
00:21:26,115 --> 00:21:28,083
Would you?

394
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:29,617
Why?

395
00:21:29,685 --> 00:21:33,451
From my recollection, Quiberon
affords a good landing.

396
00:21:33,522 --> 00:21:35,285
It is the logical choice.

397
00:21:35,357 --> 00:21:37,325
Your deduction is correct.

398
00:21:40,496 --> 00:21:42,396
Let us pray, Mr. Hornblower

399
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:46,060
that the French Republicans
don't share your logic.

400
00:21:46,135 --> 00:21:48,626
Otherwise, Quiberon Bay
may not be

401
00:21:48,704 --> 00:21:51,138
such a welcoming spot
after all.

from moving against us
through Muzillac

405
00:22:26,609 --> 00:22:30,272
west to Quiberon, here.

<i>Alors,</i>
le Colonel Moncoutant

407
00:22:35,651 --> 00:22:38,017
he will lead
a group of men

408
00:22:38,087 --> 00:22:42,285
to take control of the bridge
at Muzillac, here.

409
00:22:42,358 --> 00:22:44,952
Le colonel is, uh,
Marquis du Muzillac.

410
00:22:45,027 --> 00:22:48,190
He's, um, the, uh,
the lord of that village

411
00:22:48,264 --> 00:22:50,698
so he knows the region
very well.

412
00:22:50,766 --> 00:22:51,630
Oh, you must be glad

413
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,531
to be returning home
to Muzillac, Colonel.

414
00:22:53,602 --> 00:22:55,229
No doubt the people
will welcome you.

415
00:22:55,304 --> 00:22:58,398
Most of them will,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

416
00:22:58,474 --> 00:23:00,806
Some will be sorry to see me

417
00:23:00,876 --> 00:23:03,936
but I shall be glad
of the encounter.

418
00:23:07,049 --> 00:23:11,247
Um, Colonel Moncoutant
requires the company
of infantry

419
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,255
to secure or destroy
the bridge at Muzillac.

00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:15,551
Major Edrington?

421
00:23:15,624 --> 00:23:18,593
I believe my men
are up to the task, Captain.

422
00:23:18,661 --> 00:23:20,561
Monsieur, I protest;
as Lord of Muzillac

423
00:23:20,629 --> 00:23:23,393
the honor of defending the
bridge should fall to my men.

424
00:23:23,465 --> 00:23:25,831
With respect, Colonel,
your men have not seen action

425
00:23:25,901 --> 00:23:27,391
for several years, whereas...

426
00:23:27,469 --> 00:23:30,267
Do you question the competence
of our French troops, Major?

427
00:23:30,339 --> 00:23:32,466
Merely their lack
of recent experience.

428
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:33,974
So you do question them.
<i>Non!</i>

429
00:23:34,043 --> 00:23:36,273
I will not allow it!

430

Gentlemen, surely we
are all allies here.

431
00:23:38,681 --> 00:23:40,740
As long as our campaign
is successful

432
00:23:40,816 --> 00:23:42,374
we will all share
the honors.

Charette:
Monsieur Hornblower is right.

434
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,280
To restore the king,
that is our only concern.

435
00:23:49,959 --> 00:23:51,290
As you wish, Colonel.

436
00:23:54,597 --> 00:23:56,565
May I suggest, Colonel,
that one of my officers

437
00:23:56,632 --> 00:24:00,159
act as liaison
between yourself
and Lord Edrington.

438
00:24:00,236 --> 00:24:03,569
You seem to have a grasp of
the situation, Mr. Hornblower.

439
00:24:03,639 --> 00:24:07,575
Perhaps you'd like
to volunteer?

440

Yes, sir.

and enough powder
to destroy a bridge.

00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:30,557
Uh, what size is
the bridge, sir?

446
00:24:30,633 --> 00:24:32,601
Well, I'd imagine
it's a bit bigger

447
00:24:32,668 --> 00:24:34,101
than the river,
Matthews.

Uh, never mind.

450
00:24:40,075 --> 00:24:41,838
Um, take ten extra
powder casks to be sure.

451
00:24:41,911 --> 00:24:43,310
Aye aye, sir.

452

Styles:
Begging your pardon,
Mr. Hornblower, sir.

453
00:24:45,381 --> 00:24:47,144
Why can't the French
use their own cannon?

Styles.

455
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,011
It might have escaped
your notice, Styles

456
00:24:50,085 --> 00:24:52,212
but General Charette's
troops don't have
any cannon.

457
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:54,984
Well, I don't mind letting
them take ours, sir.

458
00:24:55,057 --> 00:24:57,787
Yesterday you were
prepared to hang a man
for taking a chicken

459
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,953
but today, you're willing
to give him our guns.

Very generous.

are all right after all

00:25:05,367 --> 00:25:07,426
No.

464
00:25:07,503 --> 00:25:11,769
Your men are reluctant
to go ashore with us?

465
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,434
On the contrary, sir,
they're all quite eager.

466
00:25:14,510 --> 00:25:15,704
I am happy
to hear it.

467
00:25:15,778 --> 00:25:17,678
With the help
of your men

468
00:25:17,746 --> 00:25:20,044
I hope to see
my home restored

469

to something of
its former glory.

470
00:25:22,785 --> 00:25:24,844
They will do everything
in their power, sir.

471
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,151
I think you are
a stranger to my country

472
00:25:28,223 --> 00:25:29,918
Mr. Hornblower.

473
00:25:29,992 --> 00:25:34,929
You cannot imagine
what these republicans
are capable of.

474
00:25:34,997 --> 00:25:37,898
There is no place
they would not defile.

Nothing they would
not besmirch.

476
00:25:40,336 --> 00:25:43,669
Let us hope
your fears are unfounded.

477
00:25:43,739 --> 00:25:44,899
Hmm.

478
00:25:44,974 --> 00:25:47,169
You do not know
these people.

479

They are barbarians.

00:26:15,904 --> 00:26:16,996
All hands shorten sail.

485
00:26:17,072 --> 00:26:18,801
Aye aye, sir.

486
00:26:18,874 --> 00:26:22,207
All hands, shorten sail!

487
00:26:22,277 --> 00:26:24,745
(<i>whistle blows</i>)

488
00:26:24,813 --> 00:26:26,747
Mr. Hornblower,
the beach is in sight.

489
00:26:26,815 --> 00:26:28,612
Prepare to disembark,
if you please.

490
00:26:28,684 --> 00:26:30,584
Aye aye, sir.

491
00:26:32,054 --> 00:26:33,146
Mr. Hornblower.

492
00:26:33,222 --> 00:26:34,154
Sir?

493
00:26:34,223 --> 00:26:35,815
You will be
on foreign soil

494
00:26:35,891 --> 00:26:37,188
the enemy
all around.

495
00:26:37,259 --> 00:26:38,954
Be on your guard,
take care.

496
00:26:39,028 --> 00:26:41,360
And do not assume
a situation is safe

497
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:44,399
until you can convince
yourself that it is so.

498
00:26:44,466 --> 00:26:45,398
I will keep it
in mind, sir.

499
00:26:45,467 --> 00:26:46,399
Good.

500
00:26:46,468 --> 00:26:49,403
I trust you will not abandon your
prudence of yesterday.

501
00:26:49,471 --> 00:26:50,631
No, no, sir, I will not.

502
00:26:52,274 --> 00:26:53,332
Carry on, Mr. Hornblower.

503
00:27:01,683 --> 00:27:05,414
You are, uh, concerned
for his safety, Captain.

504
00:27:05,487 --> 00:27:09,753
I am concerned for
the safety of all
my men, General.

505
00:27:09,825 --> 00:27:13,261
But the, uh, lieutenant
in particular, huh?

506
00:27:13,328 --> 00:27:15,592
He's one of my
best officers.

507
00:27:15,664 --> 00:27:18,360
And despite his
lack of years, I...

508
00:27:18,434 --> 00:27:20,629
I would regret
his loss.

509
00:27:20,702 --> 00:27:24,138
Then let me
reassure you.

510
00:27:24,206 --> 00:27:26,231
I am confident
that within a few days

511
00:27:26,308 --> 00:27:28,503
the whole of France
will be behind us.

512
00:27:28,577 --> 00:27:30,602
And then your young lieutenant

513
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:33,239
will be able
to tell his grandchildren

514
00:27:33,315 --> 00:27:36,580
how he helped restore
the flag of King Louis

515
00:27:36,652 --> 00:27:38,210
to its rightful place

516
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:42,917
to fly once more
over the sacred soil of France.

517
00:27:47,296 --> 00:27:49,196
<i>Vive le roi!</i>

518
00:27:49,264 --> 00:27:51,129
Others:
<i>Vive le roi!</i>

519
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,829
Man 1:
Company, fall in!

520
00:27:54,903 --> 00:27:56,996
Fall in on the right!

521
00:27:57,072 --> 00:27:59,404
Man 2:
Number two company,
over here!

522
00:28:10,619 --> 00:28:13,144
Man:
Forward, right!

523
00:28:13,222 --> 00:28:15,122
(<i>officers yelling orders</i>)

524
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:33,332
(<i>all grunting</i>)

525
00:28:37,779 --> 00:28:39,269
Archie, so,
how does it feel

526
00:28:39,348 --> 00:28:41,873
to be back on this side
of the channel?

527
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:43,975
Better with a pistol
and cannon to hand.

528
00:28:44,052 --> 00:28:46,077
We're going to need
some kind of transport

529
00:28:46,155 --> 00:28:48,180
to get the guns
and powder to the bridge.

530
00:28:48,257 --> 00:28:50,885
I'll see what Colonel
Moncoutant has in mind.

531
00:28:56,098 --> 00:28:58,123
<i>Fait attention!</i>
<i>Idiots!</i>

532
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,168
<i>Vous etes fou!</i>

533
00:29:07,075 --> 00:29:09,873
He worries more about that
machine than anything else.

534
00:29:09,945 --> 00:29:13,039
At this rate, it will be the only
thing to reach Muzillac.

535
00:29:13,115 --> 00:29:15,379
Are your men ready to move,
Mr. Hornblower?

536
00:29:15,450 --> 00:29:17,213
Yes, my lord, save
for our cannon.

537
00:29:17,286 --> 00:29:20,221
By god, if that's any of ours, I'll
have them flogged.

538
00:29:20,289 --> 00:29:22,348
Those are the French
troops, I believe.

539
00:29:23,625 --> 00:29:24,614
It would be.

540
00:29:24,693 --> 00:29:26,285
What do they think
they're here for?

541
00:29:26,361 --> 00:29:28,625
Gentlemen, you are ready
to advance?

542
00:29:28,697 --> 00:29:29,789
<i>My</i> men are ready, sir.

543
00:29:29,865 --> 00:29:30,854
What are you saying?

544
00:29:30,933 --> 00:29:32,366
Colonel, I believe
we still require

545
00:29:32,434 --> 00:29:33,492
transport for our cannon.

546
00:29:33,569 --> 00:29:35,594
That is already taken care of.

547
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,137
When you are ready,
we will proceed.

548
00:29:42,211 --> 00:29:44,611
Muzillac awaits, gentlemen.

549
00:29:49,318 --> 00:29:50,285
(<i>man coughs</i>)

550
00:29:50,352 --> 00:29:51,683
This stuff bloody stinks.

551
00:29:51,753 --> 00:29:53,983
Least they could have done
was clear out.

552
00:29:54,056 --> 00:29:56,047
Styles, let's have
less griping there.

553
00:29:57,859 --> 00:29:59,087
Just be glad
you're not

554
00:29:59,161 --> 00:30:01,755
carrying those cannons
all the way to the village.

555
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:09,401
From acting lieutenant
to commander of a dung cart

556
00:30:09,471 --> 00:30:10,938
in no more than a step.

557
00:30:11,006 --> 00:30:12,667
My career's looking up.

558
00:30:12,741 --> 00:30:14,333
Mr. Hornblower
as you and I are

559
00:30:14,409 --> 00:30:15,808
the senior
British officers

560
00:30:15,877 --> 00:30:17,742
I think we should
advance together.

561
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:19,110
(<i>horse snorts</i>)

562
00:30:19,815 --> 00:30:20,975
Come, sir.

563
00:30:21,049 --> 00:30:22,414
Unless you prefer
the dung cart?

564
00:30:33,729 --> 00:30:35,094
(<i>grunts</i>)

565
00:30:36,131 --> 00:30:38,122
(<i>groans in frustration</i>)

566
00:30:39,935 --> 00:30:42,403
I see now why you
chose the navy.

567
00:30:47,909 --> 00:30:49,672
All men and supplies
ashore, sir.

568
00:30:49,745 --> 00:30:50,734
All boats returned.

569
00:30:50,812 --> 00:30:52,074
Thank you,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

570
00:30:52,147 --> 00:30:53,614
Signal all ships
to make sail.

571
00:30:53,682 --> 00:30:54,614
Aye aye, sir.

572
00:30:54,683 --> 00:30:55,615
Mr. Bowles!

573
00:30:55,684 --> 00:30:56,616
Sir.

574
00:30:56,685 --> 00:30:57,652
Set course for
Quiberon, please.

575
00:30:57,719 --> 00:30:58,651
Aye aye, sir.

576
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,119
Pellew:
We shall head west

577
00:31:00,188 --> 00:31:02,952
to land General Charette's
main force.

578
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:37,620
(<i>coughing</i>)

579
00:31:47,436 --> 00:31:48,562
Course, Mr. Bowles?

580
00:31:48,637 --> 00:31:49,899
West by north,
sir.

581
00:31:49,971 --> 00:31:52,030
Be there by noon
with this wind, sir.

582
00:31:52,107 --> 00:31:54,075
Could've been sent for us.

583
00:31:56,244 --> 00:31:57,404
Perhaps.

584
00:31:57,479 --> 00:31:59,174
When we get to Quiberon,
Mr. Bowles

585
00:31:59,247 --> 00:32:01,943
I want you to heave to
as close in shore as possible.

586
00:32:02,017 --> 00:32:05,111
Once unloading is complete, we
shall remain there on station.

587
00:32:05,187 --> 00:32:06,620
Remain, sir? I thought...

588
00:32:06,688 --> 00:32:08,986
The <i>Sophia, Dumbarton</i>
and <i>Catherine</i>

589
00:32:09,057 --> 00:32:14,051
will return home to England,
but we...

590
00:32:14,129 --> 00:32:15,323
we stay.

591
00:32:44,292 --> 00:32:46,726
Well, Mr. Hornblower,
there is our objective.

592
00:32:52,801 --> 00:32:54,632
Do you think you can hold it?

593
00:32:54,703 --> 00:32:57,171
We must... either hold it
or destroy it.

594
00:32:57,239 --> 00:32:59,264
General Charette
is counting on us.

595
00:32:59,341 --> 00:33:00,831
Well, in that case...

596
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:23,723
Major Edrington,
you will find a ford

597
00:33:23,799 --> 00:33:26,996
half a league upstream
beyond the village.

598
00:33:27,068 --> 00:33:29,502
You will station your men
there in due course.

599
00:33:29,571 --> 00:33:31,835
I only hope we're up to it,
Colonel.

600
00:33:40,682 --> 00:33:42,479
Mr. Kennedy, have the men
set up the cannon

601
00:33:42,551 --> 00:33:43,848
to cover the southern approach.

602
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,443
We'll see about setting
the gunpowder

603
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,851
when I return from the village.

604
00:33:46,922 --> 00:33:48,890
Aye aye, Mr. Hornblower.

605
00:33:51,793 --> 00:33:53,021
You heard, Matthews.

606
00:33:53,094 --> 00:33:54,083
Aye aye, sir.

607
00:34:14,816 --> 00:34:17,216
Quiberon Bay, sir.

608
00:34:17,285 --> 00:34:20,311
Very good,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

609
00:34:20,388 --> 00:34:22,481
Take us in shore
and heave to.

610
00:34:22,557 --> 00:34:23,546
Aye aye, sir.

611
00:34:23,625 --> 00:34:25,593
(<i>whistles</i>)

612
00:34:27,896 --> 00:34:32,196
Now my people
will welcome me home.

613
00:34:32,267 --> 00:34:33,598
<i>En avant.</i>

614
00:34:44,346 --> 00:34:48,942

00:34:56,658 --> 00:35:00,788
Left, left,

616
00:35:07,836 --> 00:35:08,803
Captain...

617
00:35:09,905 --> 00:35:11,304
a signal
from the <i>Catherine.</i>

618
00:35:11,373 --> 00:35:13,933
They are ready to begin
disembarking the troops.

619
00:35:14,009 --> 00:35:15,271
Very good,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

620
00:35:15,343 --> 00:35:16,571
Make our own
preparations.

621
00:35:16,645 --> 00:35:17,612
Aye aye, sir.

622
00:35:24,953 --> 00:35:26,818
General, I would deem it a favor

623
00:35:26,888 --> 00:35:29,015
if you would allow
one of my officers

624
00:35:29,090 --> 00:35:32,253
to accompany you ashore
to send back regular reports.

625
00:35:33,528 --> 00:35:34,460
Reports?

626
00:35:34,529 --> 00:35:35,461
Yes.

627
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,964
Admiral Lord Hood
has ordered that we remain here

628
00:35:38,033 --> 00:35:39,660
until your progress is assured.

629
00:35:40,702 --> 00:35:41,930
But, why?

630
00:35:42,003 --> 00:35:44,369
I believe the admiral wishes us
to remain here

631
00:35:44,439 --> 00:35:45,838
as a place of retreat

632
00:35:45,907 --> 00:35:48,740
in case you meet heavier
resistance than anticipated.

633
00:35:48,810 --> 00:35:51,938
Very well, Sir Edward.

634
00:35:52,013 --> 00:35:54,846
I thank you for your honesty.

635
00:35:54,916 --> 00:35:57,043
But, uh, I can assure you

636
00:35:57,118 --> 00:36:01,077
these reports,
they will carry only good news.

637
00:36:01,156 --> 00:36:02,350
I pray so, sir.

638
00:36:04,359 --> 00:36:05,519
(<i>softly</i>):
I pray so.

639
00:36:06,761 --> 00:36:08,194
<i>Non! Non!</i>

640
00:36:30,919 --> 00:36:33,410

You are the linen merchant.

Aye, sir.

I had thought to meet more

That's right...

That's three barrels
placed, sir.

This'll be
the fourth.

736
00:43:19,027 --> 00:43:20,085
I reckon that'll
be enough

737
00:43:20,161 --> 00:43:21,822
to bring this down
when the time comes.

738

I think we'll put
two more barrels

But, uh, if the enemy's
expected from that side

the bridge up

we're going to be
that side.

though, Horatio.

If we have to blow up
the bridge

762

we will be cut off.

764
00:44:18,653 --> 00:44:21,121

00:44:51,185 --> 00:44:52,618
Well?

771
00:44:52,687 --> 00:44:54,279
Look at this place,
Mr. Hornblower.

772
00:44:54,355 --> 00:44:55,845
No artillery would
dare to cross here

773
00:44:55,923 --> 00:44:56,912
and if they tried

774
00:44:56,991 --> 00:44:58,959
my mama could
beat them off
with her parasol.

775
00:44:59,026 --> 00:45:00,653
They may send
infantry as well.

776
00:45:00,728 --> 00:45:01,786
They may.

777
00:45:01,863 --> 00:45:03,626
But to be plain,
my greatest fear

778
00:45:03,698 --> 00:45:05,962
is that the enemy will ignore this
place attogether

779
00:45:06,033 --> 00:45:07,398
and concentrate on the bridge.

780
00:45:07,468 --> 00:45:08,526
And if they
should cross...

781
00:45:08,603 --> 00:45:09,570
You do not
trust my men.

782

I do not doubt your men

783

but I have no confidence
that the frogs

784
00:45:13,407 --> 00:45:15,034
would stand firm
and support you.

785
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:16,804
I see, but
General Charette...

786
00:45:16,878 --> 00:45:18,209
General Charette isn't here.

787
00:45:18,279 --> 00:45:20,645
Our commanding officer
is Colonel Moncoutant.

788
00:45:20,715 --> 00:45:22,478
And from his earlier exhibition

789
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:25,576
it is clear that whatever
his rank, he is no soldier.

790
00:45:25,653 --> 00:45:29,419
Never underestimate the
enemy, Mr. Hornblower

791
00:45:29,490 --> 00:45:30,684
but never overestimate an ally

792

caught up in his own affairs.

793

Better go and
report to him.

I think this is a good place
to make camp, monsieur Bowles.

797
00:45:54,515 --> 00:45:57,678
The men, they can rest
and tomorrow...

is a rudder.

Just show it

I've heard it said
that the guillotine

807
00:46:31,953 --> 00:46:34,148
is as effective
at subduing trouble

as an army
of 5,000 men.

809
00:46:35,756 --> 00:46:37,724
I do not think it
would take 5,000 men

to subdue these people.

00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:41,119
By the look of it,
a handful could do it.

812
00:46:41,195 --> 00:46:43,686
<i>Vous avez vos ordres, allez.</i>

813
00:46:45,032 --> 00:46:47,364
(<i>loud gunshot, people yell</i>)

814
00:46:47,435 --> 00:46:49,630
(<i>soldiers grunt angrily</i>)

815
00:46:49,704 --> 00:46:51,399
<i>Qu'est-ce que vous voulez?</i>

816
00:46:51,472 --> 00:46:52,962
(<i>soldier grunts</i>)

817
00:46:56,277 --> 00:46:57,266
<i>Arretez!</i>

818
00:47:04,719 --> 00:47:06,243
Girl:
<i>Pourquoi?</i>

819
00:47:10,925 --> 00:47:13,860
<i>Restez-la!</i>

820
00:47:13,928 --> 00:47:16,726
Woman:
<i>Vite, vite, ici!</i>

821
00:47:16,797 --> 00:47:18,196
<i>Vite!</i>

822
00:47:20,568 --> 00:47:22,035
Ah, <i>messieurs.</i>

823
00:47:22,103 --> 00:47:24,230
Just the men I need.

824
00:47:24,305 --> 00:47:26,398
Gentlemen... I trust
I will have the pleasure

825
00:47:26,474 --> 00:47:28,032
of your company
at dinner tonight.

826
00:47:28,109 --> 00:47:30,669
At dinner?

827
00:47:30,745 --> 00:47:32,406
We look forward
to it, Colonel.

828
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,175
Excellent,
shall we say 8:00?

829
00:47:36,183 --> 00:47:37,616
Come, Mr. Hornblower.

830
00:47:37,685 --> 00:47:39,585
Our men will be
expecting us.

831
00:47:39,654 --> 00:47:41,815
There is nothing
we can do here.

832
00:47:48,462 --> 00:47:52,398
(<i>ship's bell rings</i>)

833
00:47:55,102 --> 00:47:56,501
Message from Mr. Bowles, sir.

834
00:47:56,570 --> 00:47:57,696
Well?

835
00:47:57,772 --> 00:47:59,899
General Charette
has made camp for the night.

836
00:47:59,974 --> 00:48:01,202
Has he met
any resistance?

837
00:48:01,275 --> 00:48:02,207
No, sir.

838
00:48:02,276 --> 00:48:04,005
That's good, surely?

839
00:48:04,078 --> 00:48:06,672
Yes, but why
is it so easy?

840
00:48:06,747 --> 00:48:10,046
The Republicans could have put
out lines of defense anywhere.

841
00:48:13,187 --> 00:48:15,155
Unless...

842
00:48:15,222 --> 00:48:16,689
Unless what, sir?

843
00:48:16,757 --> 00:48:18,725
Mr. Bracegirdle,
have you wondered why it is

844
00:48:18,793 --> 00:48:20,385
we have been ordered
to remain here?

845
00:48:20,461 --> 00:48:22,122
I had assumed it was to provide

846
00:48:22,196 --> 00:48:24,255
a place of retreat
for General Charette

847
00:48:24,332 --> 00:48:26,732
should circumstances
have turned against him.

848
00:48:26,801 --> 00:48:29,634
Aye, but only one ship when it
took four to bring him here?

849
00:48:29,704 --> 00:48:33,572
So if General Charette
is indeed forced to retreat...

850
00:48:33,641 --> 00:48:35,074
it is not expected
he will return

851
00:48:35,142 --> 00:48:37,576
with more than a quarter
of the men he set out with.

852
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,772
The mathematics of defeat,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

853
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:50,722
Moncoutant:
You see, gentlemen,
a republic...

854
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:52,759
a country run by peasants

855
00:48:52,827 --> 00:48:56,160
is a contradiction
of all the natural laws.

856
00:48:56,230 --> 00:48:57,697
Observe, if you will

857
00:48:57,765 --> 00:49:01,030
how my house has suffered
during my absence.

858
00:49:01,102 --> 00:49:02,763
The peasants could not
look after it

859
00:49:02,837 --> 00:49:05,465
because they have no breeding
and thus no intelligence.

860
00:49:05,539 --> 00:49:08,804
Entrust them with fine furniture,
paintings

861
00:49:08,876 --> 00:49:12,778
they see only firewood.

862
00:49:12,847 --> 00:49:17,250
They probably used my best
brandy to ignite the blaze.

863
00:49:17,318 --> 00:49:19,843
(<i>all laugh</i>)

864
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:22,753
Forgive me, sir,
but I have always
held it true

865
00:49:22,823 --> 00:49:26,623
that any man may better himself,
however humble his situation.

866
00:49:26,694 --> 00:49:27,888
But to what purpose?

867
00:49:27,962 --> 00:49:31,159
Monsieur, I remember
I once had a horse

868
00:49:31,232 --> 00:49:33,223
which, uh, for amusement

869
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:36,861
I taught to count off
the days of the week.

870
00:49:36,937 --> 00:49:38,962
Did this make him a scholar?

871
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:41,166
Naturally,
it remained a horse.

872
00:49:41,242 --> 00:49:42,436
(<i>laughter</i>)

873
00:49:42,510 --> 00:49:44,171
And so with the peasant.

874
00:49:44,245 --> 00:49:45,177
Surely, Colonel

875
00:49:45,246 --> 00:49:46,474
given a chance to learn...

876
00:49:46,547 --> 00:49:48,538
You know, Monsieur Hornblower

877
00:49:48,616 --> 00:49:52,074
I think you are a revolutionary
at heart yourself.

878
00:49:52,153 --> 00:49:54,713
Indeed I am not, sir.

879
00:49:54,789 --> 00:49:57,758
I began to suspect it in the
square this afternoon, actually.

880
00:49:57,825 --> 00:49:59,258
I take offense at that, sir.

881
00:49:59,326 --> 00:50:03,194
But I tease you, of course.

882
00:50:03,264 --> 00:50:06,893
But, monsieur, my country
is the farce you see today

883
00:50:06,967 --> 00:50:10,562
precisely because certain
good souls, like yourself

884
00:50:10,638 --> 00:50:13,732
believe they can teach
the peasant to think.

885
00:50:13,808 --> 00:50:19,303
Major Edrington, like myself,
you hold aristocratic title.

886
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,109
Surely you will support
me in this?

887
00:50:21,182 --> 00:50:24,276
Colonel... you have
obviously given the matter

888
00:50:24,351 --> 00:50:25,716
more thought than I.

889
00:50:25,786 --> 00:50:27,117
However, you may be assured

890
00:50:27,188 --> 00:50:29,918
that I thank God daily
for the good fortune of my birth

891
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,754
for I am certain I would have
made a miserable peasant.

892
00:50:32,827 --> 00:50:36,024
(<i>quiet laughter</i>)

893
00:50:36,096 --> 00:50:39,691
Mariette, <i>viens ici.</i>

894
00:50:39,767 --> 00:50:40,825
<i>Viens.</i>

895
00:50:40,901 --> 00:50:42,027
Take this woman.

896
00:50:42,102 --> 00:50:43,330
She is a peasant.

897
00:50:43,404 --> 00:50:44,962
She works in my house

898
00:50:45,039 --> 00:50:46,836
as her mother
did before her.

899
00:50:46,907 --> 00:50:48,875
But in the days
of the republic

900
00:50:48,943 --> 00:50:50,433
they made her
a teacher.

901
00:50:50,511 --> 00:50:53,537
Was this simple creature
put on this earth

902
00:50:53,614 --> 00:50:55,138
to teach grammar,
huh?

903
00:50:55,216 --> 00:50:57,684
It's much better
to leave her free

904
00:50:57,751 --> 00:50:59,616
to do what she
does best, huh?

905
00:50:59,687 --> 00:51:00,949
<i>Je suis peut-etre</i>
<i>un payesan</i>

906
00:51:01,021 --> 00:51:02,352
<i>mais je ne suis pas</i>
<i>an animal.</i>

907
00:51:02,423 --> 00:51:04,323
Ah, she says she
is not an animal.

908
00:51:04,391 --> 00:51:06,951
There is no need
to translate her words, sir.

909
00:51:07,027 --> 00:51:10,758
I understood her French, as she
clearly understood your English.

910
00:51:10,831 --> 00:51:12,162
Have a care, Mr. Hornblower.

911
00:51:12,233 --> 00:51:14,724
So it is self-evident, sir,
she cannot be as ignorant

912
00:51:14,802 --> 00:51:16,360
as you are so anxious
to make her.

913
00:51:16,437 --> 00:51:20,271
Once again, monsieur,
I hear the rebel in you.

914
00:51:20,341 --> 00:51:25,301
Then you mistake yourself
again, sir, for I am no rebel.

915
00:51:25,379 --> 00:51:26,710
I hope I am a gentleman

916
00:51:26,780 --> 00:51:29,408
and that I will always treat
any woman with respect.

917
00:51:29,483 --> 00:51:30,677
Enough!

918
00:51:30,751 --> 00:51:31,718
<i>Allez!</i>

919
00:51:31,785 --> 00:51:33,116
I will not argue

920
00:51:33,187 --> 00:51:36,679
with a common sailor
in the British navy.

921
00:51:36,757 --> 00:51:39,988
Before you slight a common
sailor, sir, may I remind you

922
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:42,585
that the British Navy
and its common sailors

923
00:51:42,663 --> 00:51:45,097
have conveyed
your grace's person thus far

924
00:51:45,165 --> 00:51:47,963
without incident
or injury.

925
00:51:48,035 --> 00:51:50,162
Good night, gentlemen.

926
00:51:58,279 --> 00:52:01,510
Now... where is our dessert?

927
00:52:01,582 --> 00:52:04,142
(<i>laughter</i>)

928
00:52:17,998 --> 00:52:18,930
Ma'amselle...

929
00:52:18,999 --> 00:52:21,797
I beg your pardon.

930
00:52:21,869 --> 00:52:25,828
So, we are no more
than the animals.

931
00:52:25,906 --> 00:52:29,307
I assure you, ma'amselle,
it is not a view I share

932
00:52:29,376 --> 00:52:31,640
nor would wish
to hear expressed.

933
00:52:31,712 --> 00:52:34,579
You have been kind.

934
00:52:34,648 --> 00:52:36,878
Once again,
you have tried to help me.

935
00:52:36,951 --> 00:52:39,511
I did no more than
my conscience dictated.

936
00:52:39,587 --> 00:52:44,581
But now, I am afraid there is
nothing more you can do for me.

937
00:52:44,658 --> 00:52:48,458
Ma'amselle...

938
00:52:48,529 --> 00:52:50,087
at least allow me
to escort you home.

939
00:52:50,164 --> 00:52:52,894
There is no need
to trouble yourself.

940
00:52:52,967 --> 00:52:54,958
I assure you
it is no trouble.

941
00:52:57,338 --> 00:52:59,829
It would be
a pleasure.

942
00:52:59,907 --> 00:53:01,135
Very well.

943
00:53:01,208 --> 00:53:02,175
Thank you.

944
00:53:15,389 --> 00:53:20,088
Today I think
there is only one lord
and master in France.

945
00:53:20,160 --> 00:53:21,286
Ma'amselle?

946
00:53:21,362 --> 00:53:23,353
That machine.

947
00:53:23,430 --> 00:53:27,059
For Moncoutant
or the Republicans,
it is the same.

948
00:53:27,134 --> 00:53:30,501
Does he think he will
make us love him this way?

949
00:53:30,571 --> 00:53:33,836
I am afraid I am not privy
to the colonel's plans.

950
00:53:33,907 --> 00:53:36,171
Then what are
you doing here?

951
00:53:36,243 --> 00:53:39,076
I'm here to do
my duty.

952
00:53:39,146 --> 00:53:41,512
And what is that,
your duty?

953
00:53:41,582 --> 00:53:45,245
We will hold the bridge,
until we are told to leave.

954
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:48,914
Or until you are forced
to leave.

955
00:53:50,724 --> 00:53:52,692
(<i>gasps</i>)

956

(<i>men laughing</i>)

957
00:53:59,299 --> 00:54:03,895
So, the children have
an unexpected holiday.

958
00:54:03,971 --> 00:54:06,201
I'm sure once the colonel
is more settled...

959
00:54:06,273 --> 00:54:09,538
For 20 years, I lived
like a dumb farm animal.

960
00:54:09,610 --> 00:54:12,511
I have no desire to
live like that again.

961
00:54:12,579 --> 00:54:13,511
Nor will you.

962
00:54:13,580 --> 00:54:16,481
I will not
let it happen.

963
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:17,642
You have my word on it.

964
00:54:17,718 --> 00:54:22,018
I accept your
kindness, monsieur,
but not your word.

965
00:54:22,089 --> 00:54:24,250
You do not know what
you are talking about.

966
00:54:24,324 --> 00:54:26,224
Ma'amselle,
whilst I am here

967
00:54:26,293 --> 00:54:28,784
you will come
to no harm,
I swear it.

968
00:54:28,862 --> 00:54:30,159
And when you are gone?

969
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:32,095
You do not know me,

But at least allow me

to protect you

No, Mr. Bracegirdle,
that is cannon.

What in God's name

is French artillery
doing this far west?

General, I have counted
at least 30 artillery pieces

ranged against us.

1057

(<i>cannons stop firing</i>)

Then send a squad
of men ashore.

1065
01:00:22,949 --> 01:00:25,349
They are to reach General
Charette with all speed

01:00:25,419 --> 01:00:27,011
and report back
on his situation.

Aye aye, sir.

1068

If the cannon fire
has stopped...

1069

Archie.

1077
01:01:34,421 --> 01:01:35,979
No sign of
their artillery?

1078
01:01:36,056 --> 01:01:37,353
Not yet.

1079
01:01:39,726 --> 01:01:42,160
I think I'll go to see
the major at the ford.

Horatio?

1081

When they started shooting...

1082
01:01:50,003 --> 01:01:51,231
I panicked.

1083
01:01:51,304 --> 01:01:53,704
I knew I was doing it,
but I couldn't stop myself.

1084
01:01:53,773 --> 01:01:55,673
It was the suddenness
of it, you see.

1085
01:01:55,742 --> 01:01:57,710
I think it was the same
for all of us.

1086
01:01:57,777 --> 01:01:59,972
But an officer...

1087
01:02:00,046 --> 01:02:02,913
even an acting lieutenant,
has no business to panic.

1088
01:02:02,983 --> 01:02:05,417
Archie, you have nothing
to fear from the enemy.

1089
01:02:05,485 --> 01:02:08,545
They mean to kill us, Horatio.

1090
01:02:08,622 --> 01:02:10,613
Aye, of course they do.

1091
01:02:12,526 --> 01:02:14,426
But their powder's
no threat to us.

1092
01:02:14,494 --> 01:02:18,726
From this distance,
they'd be hard pressed
to hit a barn door.

1093
01:02:18,798 --> 01:02:20,265
If you can just stay calm

1094
01:02:20,333 --> 01:02:22,358
and keep yourself
out of their sights

1095
01:02:22,435 --> 01:02:24,130
they cannot possibly touch you.

1096
01:02:28,575 --> 01:02:29,542
All right.

We are finished,
Mr. Bowles.

Save yourself if you can.

1103
01:02:53,633 --> 01:02:56,659
This is not your country,
Mr. Bowles.

1104
01:02:56,736 --> 01:02:59,170
You should not
have to die here.

1105
01:03:28,768 --> 01:03:30,258
Careful, Mr. Hornblower.

1106
01:03:30,337 --> 01:03:33,033
We have a few wasps here
who are anxious to sting.

1107
01:03:33,106 --> 01:03:34,767
So I see, my lord.

1108
01:03:34,841 --> 01:03:37,105
Do you have any indication
of their number?

1109
01:03:37,177 --> 01:03:39,407
Hard to tell; they atter
their position constantly.

1110
01:03:39,479 --> 01:03:40,912
It is the same
at the bridge.

1111
01:03:40,981 --> 01:03:43,779
I have little time
for an enemy that
daren't show its face.

1112
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:46,045
What can they hope to
gain by such a display?

1113
01:03:46,119 --> 01:03:48,383
Perhaps you should inform
Colonel Moncoutant.

1114
01:03:48,455 --> 01:03:50,218
By all means,
if you can distract him

1115
01:03:50,290 --> 01:03:51,985
from his concerns
at the village.

1116
01:03:52,058 --> 01:03:54,959
Your own concerns
there last night...

1117
01:03:55,028 --> 01:03:57,588
I trust they
were concluded
satisfactorily?

1118
01:03:57,664 --> 01:04:01,395
Why... yes,
thank you, my lord.

1119
01:04:03,737 --> 01:04:06,069
I will talk
to the colonel.

1120
01:04:06,139 --> 01:04:07,106
Mr. Hornblower?

1121
01:04:08,241 --> 01:04:09,765
If you should speak to him

1122
01:04:09,843 --> 01:04:13,370
I think a little more diplomacy
wouldn't go amiss.

1123
01:04:13,446 --> 01:04:14,572
Yes, my lord.

1124
01:04:24,090 --> 01:04:27,821
The shore party
have returned, sir.

1125
01:04:27,894 --> 01:04:29,657
Well, Mr. Bracegirdle?

1126
01:04:29,729 --> 01:04:31,424
They failed
to make contact

1127
01:04:31,498 --> 01:04:33,432
with general
Charette's camp.

1128
01:04:37,737 --> 01:04:42,674
It is as we suspected, then?

1129
01:04:42,742 --> 01:04:46,075
All men are believed
lost, sir.

1130
01:04:48,615 --> 01:04:50,207
(<i>groans softly</i>)

1131
01:04:53,653 --> 01:04:56,986
I stand before you a man
accused, Mr. Bracegirdle.

1132
01:04:57,057 --> 01:04:58,183
Accused, sir?

1133
01:04:58,258 --> 01:04:59,088
By whom?

1134
01:04:59,159 --> 01:05:00,558
By my own self.

1135
01:05:00,627 --> 01:05:01,594
I knew.

1136
01:05:04,030 --> 01:05:07,261
I believed this campaign
was a forlorn hope

1137
01:05:07,334 --> 01:05:10,394
and yet I held my tongue.

1138
01:05:11,404 --> 01:05:12,496
For what reason, sir?

1139
01:05:12,572 --> 01:05:14,199
I was ordered
to remain silent.

1140
01:05:15,608 --> 01:05:18,304
Then the responsibility
does not lie with you, sir.

1141
01:05:18,378 --> 01:05:20,278
It is with those
who gave the order.

1142
01:05:20,347 --> 01:05:22,747
In principle, perhaps,
but what of...

1143
01:05:22,816 --> 01:05:24,374
conscience, Mr. Bracegirdle?

1144
01:05:24,451 --> 01:05:26,749
And what of my order
to remain here?

1145
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:28,378
Must I also follow that?

1146
01:05:28,455 --> 01:05:30,821
For if I do, it is certain
more lives will be lost.

1147
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:35,227
Now that the republican forces
have defeated Charette

1148
01:05:35,295 --> 01:05:38,696
surely they will turn
next to Muzillac.

1149
01:05:40,734 --> 01:05:43,294
Do I disobey my order...

1150
01:05:43,370 --> 01:05:44,598
or do I stay here

1151
01:05:44,671 --> 01:05:47,037
and wait for the dead
to return?

1152
01:05:50,276 --> 01:05:51,709
The mathematics of defeat.

1153
01:05:51,778 --> 01:05:53,507
Indeed.

1154
01:05:58,485 --> 01:06:03,013
A hateful equation...

1155
01:06:03,089 --> 01:06:04,681
and I do not have the answer.

1156
01:06:10,096 --> 01:06:12,724
(<i>no voice</i>)

1157
01:06:18,772 --> 01:06:20,399
Yes, I got him.

1158
01:06:20,473 --> 01:06:21,405
Up a bit.

1159
01:06:21,474 --> 01:06:22,498
There we go.

1160
01:06:22,575 --> 01:06:23,803
A bit more.

1161
01:06:25,145 --> 01:06:25,941
Let it go.

1162
01:06:29,349 --> 01:06:30,316
Stand back.

1163
01:06:33,586 --> 01:06:36,316
(<i>screaming</i>)

1164
01:06:37,257 --> 01:06:39,191
Gotcha!

1165
01:06:39,259 --> 01:06:41,659
Gotcha, you frog!

1166
01:06:42,429 --> 01:06:43,396
(<i>chokes</i>)

1167
01:06:48,802 --> 01:06:49,734
Belay firing!

1168
01:06:49,803 --> 01:06:51,100
Don't waste the powder.

1169
01:06:57,944 --> 01:07:00,276
Jean Fabier, you
have been found guitty

1170
01:07:00,346 --> 01:07:01,677
of sedition and treason

1171
01:07:01,748 --> 01:07:03,477
and have been
sentenced to death

1172
01:07:03,550 --> 01:07:05,381
by order
of the lord of Muzillac.

1173
01:07:05,452 --> 01:07:07,386
<i>Vive le roi!</i>

1174
01:07:08,521 --> 01:07:13,117
Woman:
<i>Non, non,</i>
<i>non, non, non!</i>

1175
01:07:13,193 --> 01:07:14,820
<i>Non, non.</i>

1176
01:07:14,894 --> 01:07:15,861
<i>Non.</i>

1177
01:07:18,631 --> 01:07:21,259
Mr. Hornblower, should
you not be at the bridge?

1178
01:07:21,334 --> 01:07:23,598
Colonel, the enemy continues
to put out sporadic fire.

1179
01:07:23,670 --> 01:07:25,365
But there is no sign
of their artillery.

1180
01:07:25,438 --> 01:07:26,871
Afraid to show themselves.

1181
01:07:26,940 --> 01:07:28,601
Well, I would expect no more.

1182
01:07:28,675 --> 01:07:30,199
Thank you, Mr. Hornblower.

1183
01:07:30,276 --> 01:07:31,174
Sir, may I suggest

1184
01:07:31,244 --> 01:07:33,337
that you accompany me
back to the bridge?

1185
01:07:33,413 --> 01:07:35,278
I have no doubt
we would all benefit

1186
01:07:35,348 --> 01:07:37,077
from your assessment
of the enemy.

1187
01:07:37,150 --> 01:07:39,618
Thank you for your invitation,
Mr. Hornblower

1188
01:07:39,686 --> 01:07:43,019
but as you can see, I am
rather preoccupied at present.

1189
01:07:43,089 --> 01:07:44,056
(<i>drum roll begins</i>)

1190
01:07:51,798 --> 01:07:54,926
(<i>woman sobs</i>)

1191
01:07:55,001 --> 01:07:58,493
Sir, I must strongly advise that
you come to the bridge at once.

1192
01:07:58,571 --> 01:07:59,503
The enemy, sir...

1193
01:07:59,572 --> 01:08:00,504
Name?

1194
01:08:00,573 --> 01:08:02,404
What is this man's name?

1195
01:08:02,475 --> 01:08:03,942
Hornblower:
Sir, I cannot understand

1196
01:08:04,010 --> 01:08:06,001
why you persist
with these executions

1197
01:08:06,079 --> 01:08:08,946
when the enemy remains
at large and unaccounted for.

1198
01:08:09,015 --> 01:08:10,482
Enough, Mr. Hornblower.

1199
01:08:10,550 --> 01:08:12,609
As you see, I have
business here in town.

1200
01:08:12,685 --> 01:08:14,380
If you wish to scout
for the enemy

1201
01:08:14,454 --> 01:08:15,944
I will not prevent you.

1202
01:08:16,022 --> 01:08:18,422
But I remind you,
I am your commanding officer

1203
01:08:18,491 --> 01:08:20,118
and in my experience,
it is proper

1204
01:08:20,193 --> 01:08:21,820
to greet the absence
of an enemy

1205
01:08:21,895 --> 01:08:23,157
as good news.

1206
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:24,560
Good day, monsieur.

1207
01:08:24,631 --> 01:08:25,598
Name?

1208
01:08:36,676 --> 01:08:38,610
Prepare to set sail,
Mr. Bracegirdle

1209
01:08:38,678 --> 01:08:40,077
before we lose the wind.

1210
01:08:40,146 --> 01:08:42,171
For Muzillac, sir?

1211
01:08:42,248 --> 01:08:44,682
Aye aye, sir.

1212
01:08:44,751 --> 01:08:47,879
What of Mr. Bowles, sir?

1213
01:08:47,954 --> 01:08:50,923
We must assume him lost
with the others.

1214
01:08:53,059 --> 01:08:55,289
All hands to make sail!

(<i>man yells in French</i>)

1219
01:10:09,235 --> 01:10:11,066
So you want a fight then, eh?

1220
01:10:11,137 --> 01:10:13,605
Is that what you want?

1221
01:10:13,673 --> 01:10:15,766
Keep your head
or you will lose it.

1222
01:10:15,842 --> 01:10:17,173
Is that understood?

1223
01:10:17,243 --> 01:10:18,733
Do you understand,
Oldroyd?

1224
01:10:21,681 --> 01:10:22,648
Good man.

1225
01:10:31,090 --> 01:10:36,926
As idle as a painted ship
upon a painted ocean.

1226
01:10:36,996 --> 01:10:38,793
Sir?

1227
01:10:38,865 --> 01:10:44,997
We have no wind,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

1228
01:10:45,071 --> 01:10:47,198
We are becalmed.

1229
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:50,866
Call away the boats,
Mr. Bracegirdle.

1230
01:10:52,378 --> 01:10:53,538
Call away the boats.

1231
01:11:01,888 --> 01:11:03,981
S'arnt Major, form
a platoon of skirmishes

1232
01:11:04,057 --> 01:11:05,319
to cross the river.

1233
01:11:05,391 --> 01:11:07,655
It's time we smoked these
wasps out of their nest.

1234
01:11:07,727 --> 01:11:08,694
Yes, my lord.

1235
01:12:04,484 --> 01:12:08,079
Platoon hatt!

Rear rank, present.

1238
01:12:23,569 --> 01:12:25,537
Rear rank, fire!

1239
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,622
(<i>softly</i>):
Artillery...

1240
01:12:50,062 --> 01:12:52,394
Number one!

1241
01:12:58,070 --> 01:12:59,094
Number two!

1242
01:13:04,610 --> 01:13:06,475
Number three!

1243
01:13:33,072 --> 01:13:34,801
How far have we come,
Mr. Bracegirdle?

1244
01:13:34,874 --> 01:13:36,501
Perhaps three
miles, sir.

1245
01:13:41,848 --> 01:13:45,807
We'll get to Muzillac
if I have to row there myself.

Platoon.

Attention!

1248
01:13:56,444 --> 01:13:57,502
How many, S'arnt Major?

1249
01:13:57,579 --> 01:13:59,342
18, sir.

1250
01:13:59,414 --> 01:14:00,381
Eighteen?

1251
01:14:01,449 --> 01:14:02,677
Is that all?

1252
01:14:02,751 --> 01:14:05,845
Then where in god's name
are the rest of them?

Have you not seen...

1261
01:14:34,149 --> 01:14:37,141
have you not seen what is
happening in the square?

1262
01:14:37,218 --> 01:14:38,651
I needed to see you.

1263
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,915
Just now they
killed the baker.

1264
01:14:40,989 --> 01:14:45,085
He is guitty of no more
than selling stale bread.

1265
01:14:45,160 --> 01:14:47,287
Surely you can see how
dangerous Moncoutant is.

1266
01:14:47,362 --> 01:14:49,922
He's still my
commanding officer.

1267
01:14:49,998 --> 01:14:52,523
As an officer,
you obey him.

1268
01:14:52,600 --> 01:14:57,230
But as a man, you
know what he is,
do you not?

1269
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:03,738
Mariette, I have
to ask you something.

1270
01:15:05,747 --> 01:15:06,805
Before we came here

1271
01:15:06,881 --> 01:15:08,644
did you see any
enemy soldiers

1272
01:15:08,716 --> 01:15:10,411
passing through
the village?

1273
01:15:10,485 --> 01:15:13,784
Which enemy soldiers
did you have in mind?

1274
01:15:13,855 --> 01:15:15,379
The Royalists
or the Republicans?

1275
01:15:15,457 --> 01:15:16,788
Mariette, please.

1276
01:15:16,858 --> 01:15:18,223
No.

1277
01:15:18,293 --> 01:15:19,351
You come here

1278
01:15:19,427 --> 01:15:21,486
knowing nothing
about me or this place.

1279
01:15:21,563 --> 01:15:24,088
And you dare to ask me
to betray my own people.

1280
01:15:24,165 --> 01:15:26,463
Your silence could mean
more bloodshed, not less.

1281
01:15:26,534 --> 01:15:28,502
If you mean those butchers,
I am glad of it.

1282
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:29,935
It was not them
I was thinking of.

1283
01:15:30,004 --> 01:15:31,130
If my men are
not prepared...

1284
01:15:31,206 --> 01:15:34,539
You yourself could die.

Now please go.

1289

You cannot win here.

1290
01:15:49,124 --> 01:15:51,684
Take your men and leave now

1291
01:15:51,759 --> 01:15:53,750
while you still can.

1292
01:15:59,968 --> 01:16:00,935
Horatio.

1293
01:16:02,871 --> 01:16:06,307
I have lost too many people
without saying good-bye.

1294
01:16:23,525 --> 01:16:26,119
I will come back

(<i>cheering</i>)

1319

I think we have been made

1320

There is no army here,
just a handful of frogs

I'm convinced the army
is massed to the north, my lord.

We're facing the wrong way.

1323

Did you speak to the colonel
of this?

The colonel?

The village...
it's just butchery.

I see.

1327
01:18:57,812 --> 01:19:01,441
In that case, I suggest we look
to ourselves for command.

I think we have no choice,

This expedition becomes

1338
01:20:05,346 --> 01:20:07,246
by the moment, Mr. Hornblower.

Quickly now, bring those in.

I don't reckon they'll
be back in a hurry.

Better off
without them.

1343
01:20:42,984 --> 01:20:45,976
My lord, it seems
the emigres have
had enough.

1344
01:20:46,053 --> 01:20:47,850
They may lack discipline,
Mr. Kennedy

1345
01:20:47,922 --> 01:20:49,321
but those men
are no cowards.

1346
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:51,221
They are going to defend
the village.

1347
01:20:51,292 --> 01:20:52,554
Will it hold,
my lord?

1348
01:20:52,627 --> 01:20:54,060
It might,
for a while.

1349
01:20:54,128 --> 01:20:56,619
Mr. Hornblower is there now,
organizing their defenses.

1350
01:20:56,697 --> 01:20:58,187
But as the commanding
officer here

1351
01:20:58,266 --> 01:21:00,826
I think there is little more
we can do for these people.

1352
01:21:00,902 --> 01:21:02,164
You wish to retreat?

1353
01:21:02,236 --> 01:21:05,069
I do, though it gives me
no pleasure to say it.

1354
01:21:05,139 --> 01:21:07,539
We will take up
a defensive position
across the river.

1355
01:21:07,608 --> 01:21:09,200
Ready your men

At once, my lord.

Good.

1358
01:21:11,045 --> 01:21:12,637
What of Mr. Hornblower,
my lord?

1359
01:21:12,713 --> 01:21:16,513
We will give him
as long as we can.

1360
01:21:16,584 --> 01:21:17,516
Let us hope

1361
01:21:17,585 --> 01:21:19,519
he does not abandon
his customary caution.

1362
01:21:23,658 --> 01:21:25,216
Bring it in!

1363

No, it would

get to the bridge?

Right, sir,
and then what?

Then, Styles,
we withdraw to the beach

01:27:57,718 --> 01:28:01,347
(<i>screaming</i>):
<i>Vive le roi!</i>

1457
01:28:02,423 --> 01:28:05,790
(<i>wild cheering</i>)

1458
01:28:38,893 --> 01:28:42,021
Styles:
Sir, we've not got
much time left.

1459
01:28:46,634 --> 01:28:47,931
Let me do that, sir.

1460
01:29:21,669 --> 01:29:25,036
(<i>scattered shooting;</i>
<i>men yelling</i>)

1461
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:34,647
Make ready!

1462
01:29:39,053 --> 01:29:39,985
Horatio.

1463
01:29:40,054 --> 01:29:41,043
Edrington:
Present!

1464
01:29:41,121 --> 01:29:42,452
Hold your fire!

1465
01:29:48,195 --> 01:29:49,355
(<i>cries out</i>)

1466
01:29:52,399 --> 01:29:53,559
Give covering fire.

1467
01:29:53,634 --> 01:29:55,101
Fire!

1468
01:30:00,240 --> 01:30:04,267
(<i>sobbing wildly</i>)

1469
01:30:04,345 --> 01:30:05,972
(<i>howling</i>):
No!

1470
01:30:07,581 --> 01:30:09,708
Edrington:
Mr. Kennedy!

1471
01:30:09,783 --> 01:30:12,149
(<i>weeping</i>)

1472
01:30:14,221 --> 01:30:16,246
Kennedy:
Horatio.

1473
01:30:18,859 --> 01:30:19,951
It's no good,
Horatio.

1474
01:30:20,027 --> 01:30:21,255
She's gone.

1475
01:30:21,328 --> 01:30:23,922
Come on.
Come on.

1476
01:30:49,256 --> 01:30:51,986
Edrington:
Well, that should hold them
for a while, at least.

1477
01:30:52,059 --> 01:30:54,118
Mr. Kennedy, we will retreat
to the beach

1478
01:30:54,194 --> 01:30:55,684
and make our stand
from there.

1479
01:30:55,763 --> 01:30:56,821
Aye, my lord.

1480
01:30:56,897 --> 01:30:58,489
March the men off,
S'arnt Major.

1481
01:30:58,565 --> 01:30:59,725
Sergeant:
Shoulder arms!

1482
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:00,732
Mr. Kennedy.

1483
01:31:00,801 --> 01:31:02,894
Sergeant:
Left turn!

1484
01:31:02,970 --> 01:31:04,062
Quick march!

1485
01:31:04,138 --> 01:31:07,073
Just look after him, will you?

1486
01:31:07,141 --> 01:31:09,041
Of course.

1487
01:31:19,319 --> 01:31:24,757
Come, Horatio.

1488
01:31:24,825 --> 01:31:26,793
You did
all you could.

1489
01:31:52,119 --> 01:31:59,855
(<i>drums beating slow march</i>)

1490
01:32:23,117 --> 01:32:26,484
First company... hatt!

1491
01:32:26,553 --> 01:32:27,485
Styles:
Phew!

1492
01:32:27,554 --> 01:32:29,385
That's lovely, that is.

1493
01:32:29,456 --> 01:32:31,219
Oldroyd:
Well, take your pick:

1494
01:32:31,291 --> 01:32:33,316
The devil or the deep blue sea.

1495
01:32:33,393 --> 01:32:34,951
Edrington:
S'arnt, form the men up.

1496
01:32:35,028 --> 01:32:36,256
Colors to the rear.

1497
01:32:36,330 --> 01:32:38,389
Sergeant:
Very well, sir.

1498
01:32:40,400 --> 01:32:42,425
Battalion will form line.

1499
01:32:42,503 --> 01:32:44,767
Five sections on the right.

1500
01:32:44,838 --> 01:32:46,100
Right way!

1501
01:32:46,173 --> 01:32:47,231
March!

1502
01:32:52,412 --> 01:32:54,937
I believe our old
friends are upon us.

1503
01:32:59,219 --> 01:33:00,208
Bowles:
Ahoy!

1504
01:33:09,863 --> 01:33:12,331
One more step and
I'll see you in hell.

1505
01:33:12,399 --> 01:33:13,866
Man:
Not that frog.

1506
01:33:13,934 --> 01:33:17,665
That frog is
a good frog.

1507
01:33:17,738 --> 01:33:19,535
Man:
Bowlesy!

1508
01:33:19,606 --> 01:33:21,403
(<i>men cheer</i>)

1509
01:33:21,475 --> 01:33:23,306
Man:
Good to see you.

1510
01:33:23,377 --> 01:33:24,309
Mr. Bowles.

1511
01:33:24,378 --> 01:33:25,606
(<i>chuckling</i>)

1512
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:30,241
I thought to see you
gentlemen in Paris by now.

1513
01:33:30,317 --> 01:33:33,150
Welcome back,
Mr. Bowles.

1514
01:33:33,220 --> 01:33:34,312
Front rank, make ready!

1515
01:33:41,228 --> 01:33:42,923
Sergeant:
Front rank, kneel!

1516
01:33:49,236 --> 01:33:50,635
No one fancies
a swim then, eh?

1517
01:33:54,575 --> 01:33:56,406
Present!

1518
01:33:59,880 --> 01:34:01,074
Fire!

1519
01:34:03,217 --> 01:34:05,048
(<i>men shouting, screaming</i>)

1520
01:34:09,156 --> 01:34:10,919
Oldroyd:
It's the <i>Indy</i>!

1521
01:34:10,991 --> 01:34:16,327
Atternate guns,
fire!

1522
01:34:18,932 --> 01:34:20,524
(<i>horse neighs</i>)

1523
01:34:34,248 --> 01:34:36,739
(<i>cheering</i>)

1524
01:34:40,387 --> 01:34:43,049
I think we are well done
with this place, Mr. Hornblower.

1525
01:34:46,193 --> 01:34:48,525
Aye, my lord.

1526
01:34:48,595 --> 01:34:51,758
Well done, indeed.

1527
01:34:54,701 --> 01:34:55,929
My lord.

1528
01:34:56,003 --> 01:34:57,231
Where's your coat, Mr. Bowles?

1529
01:34:57,304 --> 01:34:59,067
Welcome back,
Mr. Hornblower

1530
01:34:59,139 --> 01:35:00,367
Mr. Kennedy.

1531
01:35:04,945 --> 01:35:06,310
Mr. Hornblower!

1532
01:35:06,380 --> 01:35:07,972
Your report in my cabin,
if you please.

1533
01:35:08,048 --> 01:35:08,844
Aye aye, sir.

1534
01:35:23,897 --> 01:35:26,832
Sir, I must report
the loss of six men

1535
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:29,801
and two cannon
from the ship's company.

1536
01:35:29,870 --> 01:35:33,033
Not to mention
our French allies.

1537
01:35:34,708 --> 01:35:36,141
Yes, sir.

1538
01:35:38,879 --> 01:35:42,076
If a captain loses
his ship, Mr. Hornblower

1539
01:35:42,149 --> 01:35:44,242
he must face a court-martial

1540
01:35:44,318 --> 01:35:47,378
whatever the circumstances
of his defeat.

1541
01:35:47,454 --> 01:35:48,386
Yes, sir.

1542
01:35:48,455 --> 01:35:50,150
And he must defend himself

1543
01:35:50,223 --> 01:35:53,124
and his reputation,
do I make myself clear?

1544
01:35:53,193 --> 01:35:54,160
Yes, sir.

1545
01:35:57,531 --> 01:35:59,260
Well, man?

1546
01:35:59,333 --> 01:36:01,062
Well?

1547
01:36:04,171 --> 01:36:05,866
Sir, I have
nothing to say.

1548
01:36:09,042 --> 01:36:10,873
The cannons were lost.

1549
01:36:10,944 --> 01:36:13,003
The men died.

1550
01:36:14,381 --> 01:36:16,747
And the royalist
cause...

1551
01:36:21,922 --> 01:36:23,981
A failure then...

1552
01:36:24,057 --> 01:36:27,549
like the rest of this
miserable expedition

1553
01:36:27,627 --> 01:36:29,094
we've been engaged upon.

1554
01:36:29,162 --> 01:36:32,131
Yes, Mr. Hornblower.

1555
01:36:32,199 --> 01:36:33,894
I include myself.

1556
01:36:42,509 --> 01:36:44,067
What were we
doing there, sir?

1557
01:36:48,648 --> 01:36:50,445
We were not wanted.

1558
01:36:55,355 --> 01:36:58,381
We brought nothing but...

1559
01:36:58,458 --> 01:37:02,189
destruction...

1560
01:37:02,262 --> 01:37:04,025
death...

1561
01:37:04,097 --> 01:37:05,962
and defeat.

1562
01:37:11,037 --> 01:37:14,302
Forgive me, sir.

1563
01:37:14,374 --> 01:37:16,342
It's all right,
Mr. Hornblower.

1564
01:37:16,410 --> 01:37:18,207
It's all right.

1565
01:37:20,547 --> 01:37:22,014
Oh, come on, man,
look at you.

1566
01:37:22,082 --> 01:37:23,481
Look at your new uniform.

1567
01:37:23,550 --> 01:37:24,915
What a sorry state.

1568
01:37:24,985 --> 01:37:27,852
Hardly the image we've
come to expect, is it?

1569
01:37:27,921 --> 01:37:30,651
Hmm?

1570
01:37:30,724 --> 01:37:31,713
No, sir.

1571
01:37:35,128 --> 01:37:37,460
When we put on this
uniform, Mr. Hornblower

1572
01:37:37,531 --> 01:37:40,227
we entered into a life
of adventure and adversity

1573
01:37:40,300 --> 01:37:44,396
but above all,
a life of duty.

1574
01:37:44,471 --> 01:37:48,874
A duty to our people,
our king, our country

1575
01:37:48,942 --> 01:37:51,775
but also,
a duty to our men.

1576
01:37:51,845 --> 01:37:54,541
We must always be

1577
01:37:54,614 --> 01:37:57,674
a source of inspiration
to them, Mr. Hornblower.

1578
01:37:57,751 --> 01:37:59,844
And whatever
may befall us...

1579
01:37:59,920 --> 01:38:02,320
whatever...

1580
01:38:02,389 --> 01:38:04,323
we must never forget

1581
01:38:04,391 --> 01:38:08,122
we are officers
in His Majesty's Navy.

1582
01:38:10,897 --> 01:38:12,023
Indeed, sir.

1583
01:38:14,334 --> 01:38:16,427
I am glad to see you
safe, Mr. Hornblower.

1584
01:38:20,740 --> 01:38:23,402
And I to be back, sir.

1585
