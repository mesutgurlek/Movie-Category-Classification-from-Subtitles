1
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:13,584
<i>I guess down at Pensacola...</i>

2
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:17,558
<i>... they still talk about the day</i>
<i>of the admiral's tea party.</i>

3
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:22,757
<i>It was one of what came to be called</i>
<i>"Spig's Big Days."</i>

4
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:28,236
<i>Spig Wead and I were in Annapolis</i>
<i>and World War I together.</i>

5
00:02:28,406 --> 00:02:31,136
<i>But all along,</i>
<i>Spig knew he wanted to fly...</i>

6
00:02:31,309 --> 00:02:34,176
<i>... and I knew I wanted</i>
<i>whatever Spig wanted.</i>

7
00:02:34,746 --> 00:02:41,151
<i>So we wangled our way into the first</i>
<i>regular flying class the Navy ever had.</i>

8
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:44,117
Not bad, not bad, not bad.

9
00:02:44,322 --> 00:02:46,290
Question, Mr. Dexter.

10
00:02:46,457 --> 00:02:48,755
The same question, Mr. Wead?

11
00:02:48,926 --> 00:02:52,225
- The same question, sir.
- Same answer, Mr. Wead.

12
00:02:52,397 --> 00:02:54,592
I suspected as much, sir.

13
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:56,893
What was the answer, Mr. Wead?

14
00:02:57,101 --> 00:02:59,160
We are not to engage in solo flight...

15
00:02:59,337 --> 00:03:02,636
...until our instructor feels
we are ready, sir.

16
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:05,332
And the reason, Mr. Wead?

17
00:03:05,543 --> 00:03:08,011
Planes and funerals are expensive.

18
00:03:08,179 --> 00:03:11,444
They cost the taxpayers money, sir.

19
00:03:11,616 --> 00:03:12,947
Attention.

20
00:03:13,117 --> 00:03:16,280
I shall see you
at the admiral's tea party.

21
00:03:16,454 --> 00:03:17,853
Dismissed.

22
00:03:19,323 --> 00:03:22,781
- Come on, let's go.
- Spig, will you quit riding him.

23
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,822
Hey, right.

24
00:03:36,207 --> 00:03:38,675
Hey, can these things really fly?

25
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:41,003
- Where did you leave your motorcycles?
- What?

26
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:43,511
- There's no smoking on the base.
- What about you?

27
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:45,774
Cigars only.

28
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:53,284
How do you like that.
What's the Army doing around my plane?

29
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:55,289
Who cares what
the Army's doing, Spig?

30
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,623
Min told us 3:00. She's waiting.
The admiral's tea?

31
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:00,627
Hey, you.

32
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:06,499
You wanna buy her?

33
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:09,401
This pile of junk?
Can anybody get it up in the air?

34
00:04:09,607 --> 00:04:13,566
Now, why don't you just hop right up
in there with me and we'll find out.

35
00:04:13,744 --> 00:04:16,542
Now, why don't we just do that.

36
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,611
Trip over your spurs?

37
00:04:25,923 --> 00:04:29,017
Put your foot here. One foot there.

38
00:04:29,193 --> 00:04:31,388
- Back over here now.
- Spig, you idiot.

39
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,723
- Jughead, let's go.
- Go where?

40
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:35,490
Taking the Army for a ride.

41
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:38,362
- Taking the Army for a ride? Just like that?
- Just like that.

42
00:04:38,536 --> 00:04:40,868
You've never been
at the controls by yourself before.

43
00:04:41,038 --> 00:04:43,632
And right now you owe six payments
on your furniture...

44
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:45,935
...three on your Stutz Bearcat,
two on your baby.

45
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:48,408
If anything goes wrong,
there'll be a court-martial.

46
00:04:48,579 --> 00:04:50,137
They'll kick you out of the Navy.

47
00:04:50,314 --> 00:04:52,976
And I'll wind up a second-class seaman,
just like this dope.

48
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:56,052
- Think of the future, Mr...
- Shut up, Pincus.

49
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,450
Spig Wead.
Never listen to anybody else.

50
00:04:58,656 --> 00:05:00,715
Just do exactly what you wanna do
all the time.

51
00:05:00,892 --> 00:05:02,757
All right, you wanna fly that thing?
Go ahead.

52
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:05,452
Go ahead, kill yourself. You'll wind up
busted and broke.

53
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:07,689
I can always join the Army.

54
00:05:07,865 --> 00:05:10,698
Why don't you be quiet
just once in a while?

55
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:12,733
Mr. Wead wants to fly,
didn't you hear him?

56
00:05:12,904 --> 00:05:15,566
Get a line. Hurry up. Get a move on.

57
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:21,174
- Ready, Army?
- Ready, Navy.

58
00:05:36,194 --> 00:05:39,493
Crazy idiot, Spig.
No, don't do it.

59
00:05:44,435 --> 00:05:46,494
- Come back.
- Spig, don't.

60
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:09,417
All right, Johnny. Where is he?
I told him 3:00.

61
00:06:09,594 --> 00:06:13,462
Did I have to specify what day?
Who's that idiot?

62
00:06:20,504 --> 00:06:22,529
That's Spig, honey.

63
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:25,266
Spig?

64
00:06:30,815 --> 00:06:32,146
Hey.

65
00:06:32,316 --> 00:06:34,716
Hey, how much time have you had?

66
00:06:34,885 --> 00:06:38,013
- About 11 seconds.
- What?

67
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:40,783
Eleven seconds.

68
00:06:42,526 --> 00:06:45,427
- But the admiral's tea party was this...
- I couldn't help it, Min.

69
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:49,697
- I couldn't help it. I tried...
- Well, you ought to know better.

70
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:55,803
I did everything I...

71
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:03,075
I did everything I could.

72
00:07:13,357 --> 00:07:16,918
- Go get that crash boat.
- Yes, sir. Let's go. Now.

73
00:07:24,702 --> 00:07:27,227
Come on. Let's go. Let's go.

74
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:46,586
Put it down, down.

75
00:07:47,024 --> 00:07:50,084
Hey, there's my crew.

76
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:52,520
Let's buzz them.

77
00:08:02,239 --> 00:08:03,706
Come here.

78
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,098
Lookit there.

79
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:08,643
Hey, lookie there.

80
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:23,722
Hey, did you ever
fly through a hangar?

81
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:28,661
- No. Oh, no. Oh, come on, fella. No, no.
- Neither have I.

82
00:08:51,589 --> 00:08:52,715
That's my wife.

83
00:08:54,425 --> 00:08:56,393
I'm sorry, ma'am.

84
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,994
I did everything I could.

85
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:04,026
- Hey, let me have the stick.
- What?

86
00:09:05,536 --> 00:09:08,300
The stick. I'm taking over.

87
00:09:08,739 --> 00:09:10,331
No.

88
00:09:24,622 --> 00:09:27,113
- What's the matter?
- We're out of gas.

89
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:29,851
Well, set her down, you idiot.

90
00:09:38,736 --> 00:09:41,227
Watch this landing.

91
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:45,739
No, on the water. On the water!

92
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:48,542
Hang on.

93
00:09:59,056 --> 00:10:00,489
Spig!

94
00:10:12,203 --> 00:10:14,103
You all right, sir?

95
00:10:17,675 --> 00:10:21,236
Sorry, shorty, I missed it.

96
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:25,007
- You all right, Spig?
- Here, give him a hand. Get him out of here.

97
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:27,349
Are you alive?

98
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,013
Spig.

99
00:10:36,694 --> 00:10:38,389
Afraid? So am I.

100
00:10:38,562 --> 00:10:41,531
Pardon me, ma'am. Please? Please.

101
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,201
Wead.

102
00:10:47,371 --> 00:10:51,535
The admiral would like to see you
in his quarters immediately.

103
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:53,233
Yes, sir.

104
00:10:53,978 --> 00:10:56,378
Won't be home for dinner, hon.

105
00:10:58,582 --> 00:11:01,107
Good. I hope they throw
the book at you, page by page.

106
00:11:01,285 --> 00:11:03,253
- I hope they throw you...
- Captain Hazard?

107
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,854
- Yes.
- General Ricketts' compliments, sir.

108
00:11:06,023 --> 00:11:09,288
He would like to see you at once.

109
00:11:20,070 --> 00:11:21,970
- And that's all you got to say?
- Yes, sir.

110
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:23,606
- Nothing more to add?
- No, sir.

111
00:11:23,774 --> 00:11:26,140
- The whole truth and nothing but?
- Yes, sir.

112
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:31,644
Carson, do you know that you're
the biggest liar in the United States Navy?

113
00:11:31,815 --> 00:11:33,874
Yes, s... No, s... Yes, sir.

114
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:37,546
- That's all.
- Thank you, sir.

115
00:11:44,094 --> 00:11:45,152
Mr. Wead.

116
00:11:45,763 --> 00:11:48,926
- Attention.
- Carry on, gentlemen. Carry on.

117
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:56,433
Mr. Wead, from Annapolis
to your commendation for war duty...

118
00:11:56,607 --> 00:11:58,802
...this is a record
that any officer might envy.

119
00:11:59,043 --> 00:12:01,238
That is, up until this episode.

120
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:05,176
- You've confirmed the facts presented?
- Yes, sir.

121
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:08,512
- Is there any statement you'd like to make?
- Yes, sir.

122
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,586
- Make it.
- Charges against me boil down...

123
00:12:10,754 --> 00:12:13,188
...to doing something
I'd never done before.

124
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:16,849
How else are we going to get aviation
for the United States Navy?

125
00:12:17,127 --> 00:12:21,427
This all may be true, but it doesn't seem
to have much bearing on this case.

126
00:12:21,632 --> 00:12:23,327
Sir, it is the case.

127
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:25,161
At least, it's mine.

128
00:12:25,336 --> 00:12:27,429
And I think it should be yours.

129
00:12:42,686 --> 00:12:44,017
- Hi, Min.
- Hi.

130
00:12:44,188 --> 00:12:45,519
Hi, Commodore.

131
00:12:45,689 --> 00:12:48,590
- I borrowed a little of Spig's corn whiskey.
- Sure, that's okay.

132
00:12:48,759 --> 00:12:50,954
What else have you got to do? Here.

133
00:12:52,396 --> 00:12:54,387
What are you
all clobbered up about, Min?

134
00:12:54,598 --> 00:12:59,092
- If Spig gets bounced out of the Navy...
- Spig's bounced out of the Navy.

135
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:05,607
Look, Johnny, Spig just joined the Navy.
I'm married to it.

136
00:13:05,876 --> 00:13:11,473
I run the mess hall, I swab the decks,
I chip the rust.

137
00:13:11,649 --> 00:13:14,846
You're afraid that they'll kick Spig
out of the Navy.

138
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:17,613
I'm afraid that they won't.

139
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,162
Hey.

140
00:13:33,137 --> 00:13:35,071
I think he's feverish.

141
00:14:08,539 --> 00:14:10,473
- Now I owe you my life.
- You owe me nothing.

142
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:11,699
That's what I meant.

143
00:14:29,393 --> 00:14:31,987
- Good evening.
- Good evening, Mrs. Wead.

144
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:34,756
- So they didn't kick you out after all.
- Right.

145
00:14:34,932 --> 00:14:37,298
And you spent
all of next month's pay celebrating.

146
00:14:37,468 --> 00:14:40,403
Wrong. I won the first-to-solo pool.

147
00:14:40,571 --> 00:14:43,233
- And I am loaded. No cracks.
- Hey...

148
00:14:43,574 --> 00:14:45,940
The squadron decided
that flying with the Army...

149
00:14:46,110 --> 00:14:50,046
...was as close to solo
as a sailor could get.

150
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:54,606
And this, my titian-haired darling,
is what I brought for you.

151
00:14:54,785 --> 00:14:57,185
First prize.

152
00:14:57,354 --> 00:15:00,915
- The Commodore's sick.
- Commodore?

153
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:04,293
Where's the Commodore?

154
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:06,292
Hiya, little old fella.

155
00:15:06,463 --> 00:15:08,260
How you feel, little old boy?

156
00:15:08,432 --> 00:15:13,460
Look what your daddy brought you.
First prize for the first crash.

157
00:15:14,671 --> 00:15:16,696
Hey, let's get out of there.

158
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:21,174
You know, this crib's getting
a little small for the old Commodore.

159
00:15:24,281 --> 00:15:25,976
Hey, Min.

160
00:15:26,950 --> 00:15:29,180
This kid is sick.

161
00:15:46,537 --> 00:15:48,334
The doc's in there.

162
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:49,972
He'll be okay, Spig.

163
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:52,404
Sure, Mr. Wead.
Them little kids get everything.

164
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:53,907
- Colds, measles.
- Yeah, sure.

165
00:15:54,077 --> 00:15:57,513
I had the mumps myself, six times.
It don't mean anything.

166
00:15:59,316 --> 00:16:01,045
Spig!

167
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,530
Sorry, Spig.

168
00:16:21,071 --> 00:16:24,370
- Anything we can do?
- No.

169
00:16:25,542 --> 00:16:27,908
But he can do her some good.

170
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:29,875
Stick around.

171
00:17:40,117 --> 00:17:43,780
- Congratulations.
- Thank you, sir.

172
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:49,122
Congratulations.

173
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:09,207
<i>We sort of split up, Spig and I did,</i>
<i>after graduation.</i>

174
00:18:09,413 --> 00:18:12,109
<i>He became a hotshot pilot, all right.</i>

175
00:18:12,282 --> 00:18:17,379
<i>Hotshot with a plane</i>
<i>and a baby carriage too.</i>

176
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,523
<i>In those years,</i>
<i>Spig was only little brass.</i>

177
00:18:20,691 --> 00:18:24,684
<i>But after all, where would big brass be</i>
<i>without little brass?</i>

178
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,700
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning, Jack.

179
00:18:30,867 --> 00:18:32,334
- Did you see this?
- Yes, sir.

180
00:18:32,502 --> 00:18:34,060
What are we going
to do about it?

181
00:18:34,237 --> 00:18:35,864
Jack, who's our best pilot?

182
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:38,030
Oh, I don't mean
the best throttle jockey...

183
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:42,304
...or the one who flies by the pit of his
stomach or by the seat of his pants.

184
00:18:42,479 --> 00:18:44,913
I mean our best brain.

185
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:47,880
Capital B-R-A-l-N.

186
00:18:48,051 --> 00:18:50,383
S-P-l-G.

187
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:54,019
- Get him.
- Yes, sir.

188
00:18:54,691 --> 00:18:57,717
- That's mine.
- Give me my shovel.

189
00:18:57,894 --> 00:18:59,885
Come on. Give it to me.

190
00:19:00,063 --> 00:19:03,760
Quiet, kids. Go on upstairs
and take your bath.

191
00:19:04,201 --> 00:19:05,566
Just a minute, young ladies.

192
00:19:05,736 --> 00:19:09,228
Come back here and pick those up
and take them upstairs with you.

193
00:19:09,473 --> 00:19:12,271
Come on. Now, hurry up. Hurry up.

194
00:19:12,476 --> 00:19:13,943
Come on.

195
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:16,102
Go on, get moving.

196
00:19:16,346 --> 00:19:19,042
See that you wash yourselves clean.

197
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:32,553
Good afternoon, Miss America.

198
00:19:35,032 --> 00:19:38,695
Here among your unpaid bills
I find a communication.

199
00:19:38,869 --> 00:19:42,498
From Washington. Washington, D.C.

200
00:19:43,607 --> 00:19:45,472
I'm not going.

201
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:49,078
Stay broke and keep moving,
that's the story of our lives.

202
00:19:49,246 --> 00:19:50,873
Spig, you've got two daughters.

203
00:19:51,048 --> 00:19:54,142
They've lived in seven different houses
in seven different stations...

204
00:19:54,317 --> 00:19:55,978
...in seven different years.

205
00:19:56,153 --> 00:19:59,384
Back and forth across the country,
and in and out of it too.

206
00:19:59,556 --> 00:20:02,116
Well, I'm just not gonna
move them anymore.

207
00:20:02,292 --> 00:20:07,025
Well, have a drink. Pensacola, Coronado.
What's the difference between houses?

208
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:10,495
It's a big difference to me
because I've got to live in them.

209
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:14,660
All right. One of these days, you'll have a
nice, big, fine, gold-braided admiral's house.

210
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,362
And you can live in it forever.

211
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,306
No, Spig. I'm a little tired.
I want to relax a little bit.

212
00:20:20,477 --> 00:20:21,967
I want to drink a little bit...

213
00:20:22,145 --> 00:20:24,739
...and I want to spend
a little more than we can afford.

214
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:26,280
Okay, you've had your say.

215
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:30,079
Now, let's throw the kids and the bags
in the jalopy and get on the road.

216
00:20:30,253 --> 00:20:33,017
- We haven't much time.
- Okay.

217
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,091
You take the high road,
and I'll take the low road...

218
00:20:36,259 --> 00:20:38,693
...and we'll see who gets
to the poorhouse first.

219
00:20:38,862 --> 00:20:41,558
But my road leads here. Right here.

220
00:20:42,499 --> 00:20:47,334
It's like you got a shiny desk
with a great big drawer marked "Navy"...

221
00:20:47,504 --> 00:20:49,870
...and a big drawer marked "flying"...

222
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,009
...and a tiny little drawer
marked "Min."

223
00:20:53,176 --> 00:20:56,304
Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera,
and so on and so on.

224
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,778
Well, there's not much air
in my drawer, Spig...

225
00:20:58,949 --> 00:21:01,850
...and I'm finding it
pretty tough to breathe.

226
00:21:02,018 --> 00:21:05,351
I think you're getting too big
for your drawers.

227
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:11,285
No, no, no, ma'am.
I'll give you a clue.

228
00:21:11,461 --> 00:21:16,125
Coronado, California.
C, like in "crap game."

229
00:21:16,299 --> 00:21:18,324
Yes, ma'am,
I want you to keep trying.

230
00:21:18,502 --> 00:21:20,163
Stick and stay, bound to pay.

231
00:21:20,337 --> 00:21:23,204
- That's my way, Susie Mae.
- Hey, Spig.

232
00:21:23,473 --> 00:21:25,407
- Beautiful?
- Is it on the level?

233
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:28,601
Ask me when we get to Bombay,
Paris or Hong Kong.

234
00:21:28,778 --> 00:21:32,077
Which reminds me. Since when have you
been cutting orders on me, boy?

235
00:21:32,249 --> 00:21:35,980
Not me, Johnny.
Me and Admiral Moffett.

236
00:21:36,219 --> 00:21:39,552
- Pincus, what's bothering you?
- It's my foot, sir.

237
00:21:39,723 --> 00:21:41,418
You win a bet from him, his feet hurt.

238
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:43,081
No, I keep my money in my shoes.

239
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,251
- Every time I pay, it hurts.
- Knock it off.

240
00:21:45,428 --> 00:21:46,986
Attention.

241
00:21:47,898 --> 00:21:49,763
- Wead, did you announce this?
- Yes, sir.

242
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,231
- Do you like it?
- Yes, sir.

243
00:21:52,402 --> 00:21:54,836
War and football
draw the biggest crowds.

244
00:21:55,005 --> 00:21:58,236
So now we'll have an
Army-Navy race around the world.

245
00:21:58,408 --> 00:22:00,569
Sir, the whole country will
be sitting in on it.

246
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:02,575
Congress is sitting in on it.

247
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:04,714
In fact, Congress is sitting on it.

248
00:22:04,881 --> 00:22:07,611
They've ordered a special hearing
tomorrow for you and me.

249
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:11,185
- Shut up and get off the phone, you stupid...
- Carson!

250
00:22:11,354 --> 00:22:12,946
Evening, sir.

251
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:19,525
- Hello, Pincus.
- Good evening, sir.

252
00:22:19,696 --> 00:22:21,095
- How's the wife?
- Fine.

253
00:22:21,264 --> 00:22:24,461
- And them lovely kiddies?
- Fine. Nice to see you.

254
00:22:31,107 --> 00:22:34,543
Yes. Yeah. It's... It's for...
I got her, Spig. Sir.

255
00:22:35,912 --> 00:22:37,470
Hello.

256
00:22:37,814 --> 00:22:39,577
Hello. Min?

257
00:22:39,749 --> 00:22:43,048
Yeah. Did you get my wire, hon?

258
00:22:43,286 --> 00:22:46,084
It looks like we're gonna be gone
about a month.

259
00:22:46,256 --> 00:22:48,588
Oh, you know how I am
about writing letters.

260
00:22:48,758 --> 00:22:50,658
They all sound like interoffice memos.

261
00:22:50,827 --> 00:22:52,454
Tell her you love her.

262
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:55,990
Looks like we'll be back here
a couple of years.

263
00:22:56,199 --> 00:22:58,690
Why don't you move on out?

264
00:22:59,069 --> 00:23:02,596
Of course I miss you.
That's what I'm trying to say.

265
00:23:02,772 --> 00:23:04,672
Look, I found a swell apartment, hon.

266
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:08,174
It'll be just great for the kids.
About a block from a kindergarten.

267
00:23:08,411 --> 00:23:10,174
<i>Of course, it'll be a little noisy.</i>

268
00:23:10,347 --> 00:23:13,612
<i>It's right near the airfield</i>
<i>and my squadron's planes...</i>

269
00:23:20,757 --> 00:23:22,486
Well, anyway, I finally got her.

270
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:24,286
Well, I didn't.

271
00:23:42,512 --> 00:23:43,843
Round the world.

272
00:23:45,148 --> 00:23:47,139
Come and see this.

273
00:23:51,821 --> 00:23:53,982
Come and see.

274
00:24:00,697 --> 00:24:03,029
- Thank you.
- With one flying by.

275
00:24:03,199 --> 00:24:04,564
- Thank you, sir.
- Your hat, sir.

276
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:07,259
- Here's to your health, Mr. Wead.
- Thank you very much.

277
00:24:07,437 --> 00:24:11,305
Please, gentlemen, gentlemen.
This is a private party.

278
00:24:11,474 --> 00:24:12,805
A private Army party.

279
00:24:12,976 --> 00:24:15,570
And a very nice party too. Right?

280
00:24:15,779 --> 00:24:18,475
- Yes.
- Here's to you.

281
00:24:18,715 --> 00:24:19,704
Alberto.

282
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:28,446
Tell them to come right out here.
It's an emergency.

283
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,252
- Is that beer?
- Yes.

284
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,156
In Prohibition?

285
00:24:32,329 --> 00:24:34,820
- Don't you know it's illegal?
- I just work here.

286
00:24:34,998 --> 00:24:37,296
Well, you should watch yourself.

287
00:24:37,467 --> 00:24:38,764
- Carson.
- Yes, sir.

288
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:43,269
- Compliments of the Army Air Corps.
- Sir. Boy.

289
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,237
Spig, don't you think
we ought to blow?

290
00:24:45,408 --> 00:24:49,742
- We're gonna stir up a heck of a mess here.
- What? Where's your curiosity, Mr. Price?

291
00:24:49,913 --> 00:24:55,146
This is a rare opportunity to study
the species <i>Homo sapiens</i>.

292
00:24:55,952 --> 00:24:57,783
Subspecies Army.

293
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,888
To General John J. Pershing.

294
00:25:00,056 --> 00:25:01,421
To Calvin Coolidge.

295
00:25:01,591 --> 00:25:03,058
- To Spig Wead.
- Who's he?

296
00:25:03,226 --> 00:25:04,955
The gentleman who sent us the beer.

297
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,618
- Spig Wead.
- Mr. Wead.

298
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,663
- Sorry.
- To Mr. Wead.

299
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:12,034
To our landlocked Congress.

300
00:25:12,202 --> 00:25:17,071
May they quit smoking cigars
for a month and buy us some planes.

301
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,406
To celebrate being selected
as the Army flight team...

302
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:26,845
...to beat Navy around the world.
- Yeah.

303
00:25:30,620 --> 00:25:32,918
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

304
00:25:33,089 --> 00:25:34,613
Spig, let's go on out of here.

305
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:39,990
Don't be so rude. Our host
is about to make a speech. Continue.

306
00:25:40,430 --> 00:25:42,057
Thank you.

307
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:45,833
Gentlemen,
I think we'd do well now...

308
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:48,334
...to make plans
for our victory dinner, right?

309
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,904
Right.

310
00:25:50,874 --> 00:25:54,571
Every race implies a loser
as well as a winner.

311
00:25:54,744 --> 00:25:57,907
And I think it could only prove,
once again, Army sportsmanship...

312
00:25:58,081 --> 00:26:01,312
...to invite the Navy losers
to our victory dinner.

313
00:26:04,754 --> 00:26:06,415
Gentlemen.

314
00:26:06,589 --> 00:26:10,616
I presume that each team
will have the same number of men.

315
00:26:10,794 --> 00:26:12,659
- Correct, mister?
- Correct.

316
00:26:13,163 --> 00:26:16,690
Each of you, then, will invite
your opposite Navy number.

317
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:21,997
For the occasion consider him
as your big brother.

318
00:26:28,711 --> 00:26:33,011
As a representative of the Navy,
I think a few words are in order.

319
00:26:33,183 --> 00:26:34,582
Very few.

320
00:26:34,751 --> 00:26:38,118
It is 25,000 miles around the world.

321
00:26:38,288 --> 00:26:42,418
We expect to finish
12,500 miles ahead of you.

322
00:26:42,592 --> 00:26:45,959
- End of few words. Thank you.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

323
00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:48,563
The trouble is, mister,
you got nothing to fly.

324
00:26:48,798 --> 00:26:51,392
We won't need much more
than a kite to beat you.

325
00:26:51,634 --> 00:26:54,865
- May I make a suggestion?
- Please do.

326
00:26:55,638 --> 00:26:57,833
Why don't you fly this?

327
00:27:12,388 --> 00:27:14,185
A few more words are in order.

328
00:27:14,357 --> 00:27:16,587
You're our guest.

329
00:27:16,893 --> 00:27:18,952
What manners.

330
00:27:19,229 --> 00:27:20,821
We grace your party...

331
00:27:20,997 --> 00:27:22,555
...we drink your liquor...

332
00:27:22,732 --> 00:27:25,929
...and I suppose
this is supposed to be funny.

333
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,592
A matter of opinion.

334
00:27:27,770 --> 00:27:30,398
Well, the liquor was pretty good.

335
00:27:31,207 --> 00:27:33,698
And the cake is nice.

336
00:27:35,245 --> 00:27:37,304
- Right?
- Right.

337
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:46,654
Thank you for the party, gentlemen.
Thank you. And thank you.

338
00:27:56,099 --> 00:27:57,498
Police!

339
00:27:57,667 --> 00:28:00,227
Police!

340
00:28:01,304 --> 00:28:04,102
Here, buddy, hold this.

341
00:28:06,309 --> 00:28:09,938
Hey, let's quit. We're even.

342
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,695
Police! Police!

343
00:28:36,339 --> 00:28:37,567
The kitchen. The kitchen.

344
00:29:04,934 --> 00:29:06,993
I can't think of an excuse.
Not a thing.

345
00:29:07,170 --> 00:29:09,764
I'm going to say
that I forgot my wife's birthday.

346
00:29:09,939 --> 00:29:12,373
She clobbered me.
They can't argue with that.

347
00:29:12,575 --> 00:29:15,874
Sure can't. But me,
I can't think of a thing.

348
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,280
- Go ahead.
- You go ahead.

349
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,849
You afraid?

350
00:29:22,018 --> 00:29:23,451
No.

351
00:29:25,755 --> 00:29:28,315
So we were discussing...

352
00:29:30,426 --> 00:29:32,291
Mr. Wead.

353
00:29:32,462 --> 00:29:34,589
Captain Hazard.

354
00:29:35,832 --> 00:29:38,528
Mr. Wead, Captain Hazard.

355
00:29:38,701 --> 00:29:41,329
Information has reached me
through certain channels...

356
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,870
...that you two gentlemen have met.

357
00:29:44,507 --> 00:29:47,340
Just for the record, are we at war?

358
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,205
Where did you get those eyes?

359
00:29:49,379 --> 00:29:51,677
I forgot my wife's birthday,
and she clobbered me.

360
00:29:51,848 --> 00:29:53,372
And you?

361
00:29:53,549 --> 00:29:56,313
Me, I can't think of a thing.

362
00:30:01,491 --> 00:30:05,325
Well, gentlemen,
your round-the-world race is cancelled.

363
00:30:05,495 --> 00:30:09,932
Well, the Army flight will take place because
the Army asked for it first. But no race.

364
00:30:10,166 --> 00:30:12,361
The Navy appreciates
your position, senator.

365
00:30:12,535 --> 00:30:16,699
Good. You can't win,
might as well be a good loser.

366
00:30:18,574 --> 00:30:21,441
However, I'm not sure the entire Navy
shares that view.

367
00:30:21,644 --> 00:30:24,135
- Permission to speak, sir.
- Fire away.

368
00:30:24,714 --> 00:30:29,515
It's our training. We're not taught
to be losers, good or otherwise.

369
00:30:29,686 --> 00:30:33,349
And now we are losing carriers that
we need and planes to fly from them.

370
00:30:33,723 --> 00:30:36,157
Someday we may lose
something bigger than that.

371
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,853
If you can't develop
both services impartially...

372
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:43,521
...you're either shirking your duty
or you don't know what your duty is.

373
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:45,796
Well, son...

374
00:30:45,968 --> 00:30:49,426
...there's a lot of things we don't know.
Here's some of the things we do.

375
00:30:49,672 --> 00:30:53,699
Now, we've got a country
yelling "pacifism" at us. Disarmament.

376
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,743
The world is gonna live together
like one big, happy family.

377
00:30:56,913 --> 00:30:59,177
There'll be no more war.

378
00:30:59,682 --> 00:31:03,049
The Army and the Navy
are going out of business.

379
00:31:04,987 --> 00:31:06,887
Now, you...

380
00:31:07,423 --> 00:31:10,119
...outside of the clubs and barrooms...

381
00:31:10,593 --> 00:31:13,494
...you'll fight maybe one war
in a generation.

382
00:31:14,197 --> 00:31:18,099
Well, we have to fight those voters
every blamed two years.

383
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:23,435
Now, you want us to cancel
that flight for the Army?

384
00:31:23,606 --> 00:31:27,667
Well, no, sir. That stunt may get them
the bombers they need for their service.

385
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:31,275
You just want to nail down
the <i>Lexington</i> and <i>Saratoga</i>?

386
00:31:31,647 --> 00:31:35,083
- Yes, sir.
- Not just a mockup, like the <i>Langley</i>.

387
00:31:35,351 --> 00:31:37,046
Well...

388
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:41,254
...they tell me there's more than
one way to skin a cat, admiral.

389
00:31:42,258 --> 00:31:44,089
- That'll be all, gentlemen.
- Yes, sir.

390
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:46,251
By the way...

391
00:31:46,429 --> 00:31:48,124
...off the record, who won that fight?

392
00:31:48,297 --> 00:31:50,265
- The Navy.
- The Army.

393
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:57,295
Oh, boy, where is
the ladies' retiring room?

394
00:31:57,473 --> 00:32:00,237
- Right in there, ma'am.
- Come on.

395
00:32:08,518 --> 00:32:11,146
Black eyes. Swimming pool.

396
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:13,185
Congressmen.

397
00:32:13,356 --> 00:32:15,551
Now, what's this new scuttlebutt
you're spreading?

398
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:17,693
International seaplane races, sir.

399
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:21,853
The United States has never won them,
nor the Schneider Cup that goes with them.

400
00:32:22,031 --> 00:32:25,626
- I'm aware of that, Wead.
- All right, sir, let's play the races.

401
00:32:25,802 --> 00:32:27,997
We'll hit the public
and keep hitting them.

402
00:32:28,171 --> 00:32:31,572
You okay it, sir, and we'll bring
the Schneider Cup home.

403
00:32:31,774 --> 00:32:35,471
Fill it with champagne
and jam it down the Army's throat.

404
00:32:36,646 --> 00:32:39,171
Yeah, that would be nice.

405
00:32:39,515 --> 00:32:41,813
There's only one thing wrong.

406
00:32:42,885 --> 00:32:45,615
Why let the Army
drink our champagne?

407
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,395
That's your daddy up there
with the goggles.

408
00:33:27,563 --> 00:33:29,155
See your daddy?
He's the one beside...

409
00:33:29,332 --> 00:33:31,357
- Daddy.
- Him?

410
00:33:31,534 --> 00:33:33,695
- Yes.
- Daddy.

411
00:33:33,870 --> 00:33:35,770
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

412
00:33:35,938 --> 00:33:37,337
Will you shut up.

413
00:33:37,506 --> 00:33:39,906
Oh, drop dead.

414
00:33:50,353 --> 00:33:51,650
Hey.

415
00:33:51,854 --> 00:33:54,049
Every single day...

416
00:34:09,772 --> 00:34:14,505
This one is for old Dave,
the first to cross the line.

417
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:16,770
Yeah.

418
00:34:19,615 --> 00:34:21,515
- Let me drink to old Dave.
- Hear, hear.

419
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,676
- Come on, hurry up.
- Hurry it up there.

420
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,999
Speech, speech.

421
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:40,101
- Give me that cup.
- Yeah, pass it on.

422
00:34:40,269 --> 00:34:43,500
This is a happy cup, inside and out.

423
00:34:43,673 --> 00:34:48,406
And here's a toast to all of you
who brought it back where it belongs.

424
00:34:51,180 --> 00:34:55,116
You're a great crew,
each and every one of you.

425
00:34:55,284 --> 00:34:58,378
Even Carson there,
who slept all through the race.

426
00:34:58,554 --> 00:35:03,685
All I know, Jughead, you were up
96 hours getting the planes ready.

427
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:07,454
But seriously, I want to thank
each and every one of you...

428
00:35:07,630 --> 00:35:09,689
...from the bottom of my heart.

429
00:35:09,865 --> 00:35:12,333
It was a long, backbreaking job...

430
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:15,561
...and those that flew know what
they owe to the others.

431
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:19,936
If it hadn't been for the cooperation
and the teamwork...

432
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:52,166
- What's a record?
- I told you.

433
00:35:52,341 --> 00:35:54,935
It's something nobody else ever did.

434
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:58,740
Would it be a record
if Daddy came home?

435
00:36:00,883 --> 00:36:04,375
That would be a world's record.

436
00:36:34,216 --> 00:36:37,549
- We don't want anything.
- We're broke.

437
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,499
We've already got a carpet sweeper.

438
00:37:33,676 --> 00:37:36,543
- It ain't paid for.
- It isn't paid for.

439
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,146
Don't you kids ever read
the newspapers?

440
00:37:39,315 --> 00:37:41,613
I'm your daddy.

441
00:37:41,884 --> 00:37:44,819
- Hey, Pickle Puss, come here.
- What is it?

442
00:37:44,987 --> 00:37:47,046
Remember:
Go and ask.

443
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,157
Are you the funny man
with the goggles?

444
00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:51,190
I sure am, honey.

445
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:54,124
Oh, Daddy.

446
00:37:54,296 --> 00:37:57,356
And I've got a present
for each one of you.

447
00:37:57,533 --> 00:38:01,629
Now, there's one for you,
and one for you.

448
00:38:02,471 --> 00:38:05,634
- Where's your mother?
- At the bridge club.

449
00:38:05,808 --> 00:38:07,742
The bridge club, eh?

450
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:10,401
- Oh, they're beautiful.
- Who's getting your supper?

451
00:38:10,613 --> 00:38:13,104
I am, of course.

452
00:38:15,684 --> 00:38:17,151
Do you want some?

453
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:19,549
- What is it?
- Chicken à la King.

454
00:38:19,722 --> 00:38:22,816
- Out of... Out of a tin can.
- I sure do.

455
00:38:22,992 --> 00:38:24,550
- I'm hungry.
- Want some?

456
00:38:24,727 --> 00:38:27,355
- Sure.
- Then you just sit down right there.

457
00:38:27,530 --> 00:38:29,725
I was going to.

458
00:38:32,001 --> 00:38:34,060
Shall I call you "Daddy"?

459
00:38:34,236 --> 00:38:36,170
- You better.
- Me too?

460
00:38:36,338 --> 00:38:38,898
You too, Pickle Puss.

461
00:38:39,074 --> 00:38:41,542
Here, wait a minute. Let me take that.

462
00:38:41,710 --> 00:38:45,874
I'll serve you. Come on.
Sit down. Sit down.

463
00:38:55,691 --> 00:38:57,249
Good night.

464
00:38:57,426 --> 00:39:00,361
- You forgot something.
- What?

465
00:39:00,529 --> 00:39:01,894
Now I lay me down to sleep.

466
00:39:02,064 --> 00:39:04,396
- I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
- I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

467
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:06,432
- If I die before I wake...
- lf I die before I wake...

468
00:39:06,602 --> 00:39:09,196
...I pray the Lord my soul to take.
...I pray the Lord my soul to take.

469
00:39:09,371 --> 00:39:10,463
- Good night.
- Good night.

470
00:39:10,639 --> 00:39:11,628
Good night who?

471
00:39:11,807 --> 00:39:14,139
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

472
00:39:15,477 --> 00:39:17,274
Good night.

473
00:39:20,749 --> 00:39:22,376
Sleep tight.

474
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:47,066
- Hi.
- Hi.

475
00:40:47,269 --> 00:40:51,069
<i>Home is the sailor, home from the sea</i>
<i>And the hunter home from the hill</i>

476
00:40:51,273 --> 00:40:54,538
Well, they cooked their own supper,
and then I threw them in bed.

477
00:40:54,710 --> 00:40:56,678
- How'd it feel?
- Great.

478
00:40:56,845 --> 00:41:00,508
But I blackmailed them.
I brought them some beads.

479
00:41:01,016 --> 00:41:06,579
Well, go ahead, get it over with.
Ask me where I have been.

480
00:41:06,789 --> 00:41:09,758
Oh, I know where you've been.
You've been playing bridge.

481
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,756
You got behind.

482
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:16,523
The winners go to dinner
and the losers stay to play.

483
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:18,924
I know how it is.

484
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:23,870
I was going to phone you,
and then I got a cute idea.

485
00:41:24,039 --> 00:41:26,872
I thought I'd come in unannounced.
To tell you the truth...

486
00:41:27,042 --> 00:41:28,942
Why don't you?

487
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:35,350
All right. I've been thinking
what a heel I've been...

488
00:41:35,517 --> 00:41:38,350
...about you and about my own kids.

489
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,852
I don't know.
When I do something, I go all the way.

490
00:41:41,023 --> 00:41:45,858
Living, gambling, flying,
I tap myself out.

491
00:41:47,029 --> 00:41:48,963
I guess that's the way I want it to be.

492
00:41:49,131 --> 00:41:54,592
- Maybe, even, it's the way I am.
- Star-spangled Spig.

493
00:41:54,770 --> 00:41:58,763
Damn the martinis, full speed ahead
and don't give up the ship.

494
00:42:00,576 --> 00:42:02,441
Have a drink.

495
00:42:03,445 --> 00:42:05,970
Listen, Min, I'm trying to say
I've been a fool.

496
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:10,244
First-class, senior-grade, gold-braided.

497
00:42:11,887 --> 00:42:13,411
So have I.

498
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:17,286
Okay, let's change it.

499
00:42:17,459 --> 00:42:20,257
Let's grow up before our kids do.

500
00:42:20,429 --> 00:42:22,954
We'd better hurry up.

501
00:42:34,476 --> 00:42:38,105
- Phone's ringing.
- Oh, let it ring.

502
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,976
Why not? It's probably just Washington.

503
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,913
Oh, I forgot.

504
00:42:43,085 --> 00:42:45,383
Do you know that you're in the arms
of the newest...

505
00:42:45,554 --> 00:42:48,523
...lieutenant commander
in the United States Navy?

506
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:51,124
Star-spangled Spig.

507
00:42:51,293 --> 00:42:53,022
And a squadron leader.

508
00:42:53,195 --> 00:42:55,857
All I know is that I'm in the arms
of a fella named Spig...

509
00:42:56,031 --> 00:42:58,522
...that I'm nuts about.

510
00:42:59,468 --> 00:43:02,130
Hey, how about
getting back to your necking...

511
00:43:02,304 --> 00:43:05,398
...with a little more enthusiasm.
- Right.

512
00:43:08,977 --> 00:43:11,946
Mommy, do you know
whose lap you're in?

513
00:43:12,114 --> 00:43:13,103
No.

514
00:43:13,282 --> 00:43:15,011
- Daddy's.
- Daddy's.

515
00:43:15,184 --> 00:43:17,618
Go ahead, shake hands with him.

516
00:43:18,954 --> 00:43:20,387
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

517
00:43:20,556 --> 00:43:23,184
Why don't you go to bed.

518
00:43:41,677 --> 00:43:44,043
Mama.

519
00:43:48,717 --> 00:43:51,083
Mama.

520
00:43:53,222 --> 00:43:55,713
Mama.

521
00:43:58,727 --> 00:44:00,558
Spig!

522
00:44:03,899 --> 00:44:05,662
Spig, what...?

523
00:44:13,242 --> 00:44:15,437
Don't. Don't move me, Min.

524
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:19,103
I can't... My back.

525
00:44:19,681 --> 00:44:21,512
No feeling.

526
00:44:21,884 --> 00:44:25,251
Call hospital.

527
00:44:25,921 --> 00:44:28,116
Naval hospital.

528
00:44:54,182 --> 00:44:56,650
Bilateral paralysis resulting
from indicated fracture...

529
00:44:56,818 --> 00:44:58,479
...of the fifth cervical vertebrae.

530
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:02,055
- You mean my neck's busted?
- That's it.

531
00:45:02,224 --> 00:45:05,455
- How bad is that?
- Not good.

532
00:45:05,627 --> 00:45:06,992
What are my chances?

533
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:11,428
If I operate right away, about 4-1.

534
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,227
Well, what are we waiting for?

535
00:45:13,402 --> 00:45:15,927
Permission from you
and your next of kin.

536
00:45:16,104 --> 00:45:18,971
I'm my next of kin, let's go.

537
00:45:38,126 --> 00:45:41,857
- Scissors.
- Scissors.

538
00:45:47,069 --> 00:45:49,367
- Sponge.
- Sponge.

539
00:45:49,571 --> 00:45:50,936
Doctor.

540
00:45:51,106 --> 00:45:52,630
Pressure's dropping, doctor.

541
00:45:52,808 --> 00:45:55,675
- Cc adrenalin.
- Cc adrenalin.

542
00:45:55,844 --> 00:45:57,209
Hey.

543
00:45:57,579 --> 00:45:59,774
- Can you hear me, Wead?
- Yes.

544
00:45:59,948 --> 00:46:01,279
Open your eyes, Spig.

545
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:03,475
- Can see you anything?
- No.

546
00:46:03,685 --> 00:46:05,152
- He's taken a dive.
- Hey.

547
00:46:05,854 --> 00:46:07,219
What's the matter, Mr. Wead?

548
00:46:07,389 --> 00:46:09,118
- Can't you ever win a fight?
- Carson.

549
00:46:09,291 --> 00:46:11,054
- Yeah, Carson.
- Trying to keep my alive.

550
00:46:11,226 --> 00:46:12,955
- That's right.
- You're doing it, thanks.

551
00:46:13,128 --> 00:46:17,462
- You're welcome.
- Get him the hell out of here.

552
00:46:24,139 --> 00:46:28,667
Ma'am, throw this under your belt.
Make a new man out of you.

553
00:46:28,844 --> 00:46:30,607
Thanks.

554
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:14,084
- Who are you?
- Me? Oh, I'm the new corpsman, ma'am.

555
00:47:14,256 --> 00:47:17,054
Assigned to take care of Mr. Wead.
Glad to cooperate with you.

556
00:47:17,225 --> 00:47:19,955
And you just call up...
Hey, you're pretty.

557
00:47:20,162 --> 00:47:23,256
- We'll see about this.
- Yeah, you do that.

558
00:47:23,432 --> 00:47:24,899
- Carson.
- Yes, sir, Carson.

559
00:47:25,067 --> 00:47:27,126
- Excuse me.
- Why?

560
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:29,236
Why? Because I'm your new nurse,
that's why.

561
00:47:29,404 --> 00:47:31,395
I'm gonna see you through
this little trouble.

562
00:47:31,573 --> 00:47:34,599
- Now, listen, do you know the fix you're in?
- No. Do you?

563
00:47:34,776 --> 00:47:37,643
Yes. I figured it out all night,
and now I'm gonna brief you.

564
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,974
Well, go ahead, brief.

565
00:47:40,182 --> 00:47:44,278
All right. Now, look,
this here is a spinal cord.

566
00:47:44,453 --> 00:47:48,014
It's just like the main cable
on any three-phase circuit.

567
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,627
When you stunted down them stairs,
you busted five-sixths of it.

568
00:47:53,195 --> 00:47:55,629
- Can it be spliced?
- What?

569
00:47:55,797 --> 00:47:57,628
Can it be spliced?

570
00:47:57,799 --> 00:48:00,097
Oh, these croakers will tell you
it can't be done...

571
00:48:00,268 --> 00:48:02,133
...but I'm telling you it can.

572
00:48:02,304 --> 00:48:04,966
You remember the manual said
I couldn't splice rudder cable?

573
00:48:05,140 --> 00:48:06,164
One-sixth left.

574
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,172
That's right. That is gonna be enough.

575
00:48:08,343 --> 00:48:10,834
We're gonna learn that one-sixth
to carry the load...

576
00:48:11,012 --> 00:48:13,003
...all the way down
to these feeder circuits.

577
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:17,242
You know, these medics here never saw
no one wire on a bad magneto post.

578
00:48:17,419 --> 00:48:19,387
That's true.

579
00:48:19,921 --> 00:48:22,651
Doctor, you heard him.
He gives me a chance.

580
00:48:22,824 --> 00:48:25,793
- I heard him.
- But you don't.

581
00:48:25,961 --> 00:48:30,421
Well, we never give up hope.
We'll do the best we can.

582
00:48:30,665 --> 00:48:35,159
- Carson, when were you busted back?
- Hey, Mr. Wead, he recognized me.

583
00:48:35,337 --> 00:48:36,998
Do I have to have him around?

584
00:48:37,172 --> 00:48:39,436
- Do you want him, Spig?
- No.

585
00:48:39,608 --> 00:48:41,508
But I guess he'll have to do.

586
00:48:41,676 --> 00:48:44,440
I've assigned Miss Crumley
to your case, Wead.

587
00:48:44,613 --> 00:48:46,274
Fine woman. Fine nurse.

588
00:48:46,448 --> 00:48:48,848
Anything we can do, Miss Crumley,
just give us a buzz.

589
00:48:49,017 --> 00:48:51,281
This is Miss Crumley.

590
00:49:04,866 --> 00:49:06,629
- How is he, Carson?
- What do you expect?

591
00:49:06,802 --> 00:49:09,703
I can't get the guy to eat. Won't sleep.
He hasn't eaten a thing.

592
00:49:09,871 --> 00:49:13,068
He hasn't touched the orange juice.
A piece of toast. Soup or something.

593
00:49:13,241 --> 00:49:15,402
But he don't wanna touch nothing.

594
00:49:24,551 --> 00:49:26,178
Min?

595
00:49:27,854 --> 00:49:31,187
- Hi.
- Hi.

596
00:49:33,226 --> 00:49:36,684
- The kids?
- Oh, they're fine.

597
00:49:36,863 --> 00:49:40,856
- Do they know?
- Big one does.

598
00:49:41,034 --> 00:49:43,662
Little one thinks
you just took off again.

599
00:49:43,837 --> 00:49:47,432
Oh, she's worn the beads
around her neck.

600
00:49:47,607 --> 00:49:52,010
- Is it raining?
- Yeah.

601
00:49:52,178 --> 00:49:57,047
Those doctors,
did they tell you it was no-go?

602
00:49:58,385 --> 00:50:01,354
Look, Spig, they haven't
given up hope, don't you.

603
00:50:01,521 --> 00:50:06,083
Oh, it's got all twisted, Min.
It's stay broke and never move.

604
00:50:06,259 --> 00:50:07,851
I won't let you believe that.

605
00:50:08,027 --> 00:50:12,691
You always yelled that I moved around
too much, maybe you were right.

606
00:50:13,566 --> 00:50:16,433
You know what else you said
that was right?

607
00:50:17,437 --> 00:50:21,134
"Damn the martinis, full speed ahead."

608
00:50:21,908 --> 00:50:27,778
Well, you be like that, Min.
You be on your own from now on.

609
00:50:28,748 --> 00:50:32,616
Don't talk like that, Spig.
You'll... You'll be all right again.

610
00:50:32,786 --> 00:50:34,947
No, don't pity me.

611
00:50:35,121 --> 00:50:39,387
I never pitied anybody,
so I don't want any.

612
00:50:40,994 --> 00:50:44,828
Sorry, Spig. You're right.

613
00:50:44,998 --> 00:50:48,991
And don't pity yourself either.
Get out in the world.

614
00:50:49,169 --> 00:50:53,469
Be alive. Take your turn. I took mine.

615
00:50:56,776 --> 00:51:01,475
All right, Spig. Let's have it.
What are you trying to tell me?

616
00:51:01,648 --> 00:51:04,617
We were just about through anyway, Min.

617
00:51:04,784 --> 00:51:08,686
We'd lost it. It got away from us.

618
00:51:09,889 --> 00:51:15,020
Whatever it was,
and we both remember...

619
00:51:15,428 --> 00:51:19,956
...the good part, the fine time...

620
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,961
...let's not louse it up...

621
00:51:23,136 --> 00:51:25,297
...and let it be something bad
and hopeless...

622
00:51:25,472 --> 00:51:28,305
...just because we couldn't keep it.

623
00:51:35,148 --> 00:51:40,484
- I'll bring the kids in to see you.
- No. I couldn't take it.

624
00:51:44,491 --> 00:51:46,857
Will you tell me when?

625
00:51:47,026 --> 00:51:49,358
I'll tell you when.

626
00:51:59,072 --> 00:52:03,839
The big one, she's like me.

627
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:07,207
Don't let her get away with a thing.

628
00:52:08,748 --> 00:52:10,841
And Pickle Puss...

629
00:52:11,017 --> 00:52:14,350
...little old Pickle Puss, she's like...

630
00:52:14,521 --> 00:52:16,455
Like you.

631
00:52:17,757 --> 00:52:20,089
Love her hard.

632
00:52:20,326 --> 00:52:22,794
She's lost without it.

633
00:52:26,399 --> 00:52:28,458
So long, Spig.

634
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:33,065
So long, Min.

635
00:52:36,743 --> 00:52:38,734
Good luck.

636
00:53:06,573 --> 00:53:10,031
- Good morning.
- Is it still raining?

637
00:53:10,209 --> 00:53:13,440
Rain in California?
Besides, don't knock the rain.

638
00:53:13,613 --> 00:53:17,413
Rain makes the corn jump up. Cows eat
the corn, boom, you got porterhouse.

639
00:53:17,584 --> 00:53:20,485
I went over to Tijuana,
got us some of that panther sweat.

640
00:53:20,653 --> 00:53:24,089
- Medicinal panther sweat.
- Tequila.

641
00:53:24,257 --> 00:53:27,624
Besides, if we didn't have any rain,
we wouldn't have any ocean.

642
00:53:27,794 --> 00:53:31,059
No ocean, no Navy.
No Navy, no retired pay.

643
00:53:31,230 --> 00:53:33,289
You and me would have to go to work.

644
00:53:33,466 --> 00:53:35,093
You about ready to get started?

645
00:53:35,268 --> 00:53:36,758
- Why not?
- Okay.

646
00:53:36,936 --> 00:53:39,234
Now, that brain of yours
is like a generator.

647
00:53:39,405 --> 00:53:43,774
We're gonna generate that power right
past that break in your spinal cord...

648
00:53:43,943 --> 00:53:47,674
...all the way down here to these
feeder circuits they call nerves.

649
00:53:47,847 --> 00:53:51,806
Now, we're gonna start
with this big left pinkie.

650
00:53:51,985 --> 00:53:53,316
- You feel that?
- No.

651
00:53:53,486 --> 00:53:55,317
Well, anyway, that's it.

652
00:53:55,488 --> 00:53:58,821
Now, you start saying,
"I'm gonna move that toe."

653
00:53:58,992 --> 00:54:00,619
Come on, mister, say it.

654
00:54:00,793 --> 00:54:02,658
Move.

655
00:54:02,829 --> 00:54:06,629
- Move, you little dead stump.
- No, say it nice. Say it nice.

656
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:10,294
Come on, say it, mister.
"I'm gonna move that toe," say it.

657
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:12,802
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- All right, say it again.

658
00:54:12,972 --> 00:54:15,372
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- All right, louder.

659
00:54:15,575 --> 00:54:17,873
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Say it again.

660
00:54:18,077 --> 00:54:20,511
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Keep saying it.

661
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:23,615
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Come on, believe it.

662
00:54:23,783 --> 00:54:26,718
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- And again.

663
00:54:26,886 --> 00:54:29,855
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Louder, once more.

664
00:54:30,023 --> 00:54:33,186
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- All right, knock it off. Take a little rest.

665
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:35,293
- Did anything happen?
- Well, not yet.

666
00:54:35,461 --> 00:54:37,156
Let's put some oil in the crankcase.

667
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:39,764
Now, don't be impatient.
We got lots of time, Mr. Wead.

668
00:54:39,932 --> 00:54:43,095
We're gonna... That's enough.
We're gonna stick right at this.

669
00:54:43,703 --> 00:54:46,171
Start saying it again,
"I'm gonna move that toe."

670
00:54:46,339 --> 00:54:48,534
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Come on, loud.

671
00:54:48,708 --> 00:54:50,835
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- All right, believe it.

672
00:54:51,010 --> 00:54:54,207
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Again.

673
00:54:54,380 --> 00:54:56,507
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Believe it.

674
00:54:56,683 --> 00:54:59,413
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Come on. Go.

675
00:54:59,619 --> 00:55:02,213
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Go ahead.

676
00:55:02,388 --> 00:55:04,879
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Good and loud, try it.

677
00:55:05,058 --> 00:55:07,219
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Come on, Mr. Wead.

678
00:55:07,393 --> 00:55:09,861
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- That's it. Now you got it.

679
00:55:10,029 --> 00:55:12,259
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- That's it. Go on.

680
00:55:12,432 --> 00:55:14,696
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Go again.

681
00:55:14,867 --> 00:55:17,597
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Once more.

682
00:55:23,443 --> 00:55:26,173
Get that man's name.

683
00:55:27,146 --> 00:55:29,011
Wait till you see what I got.

684
00:55:29,182 --> 00:55:33,084
I kicked myself all the way back from
that joint for not thinking of this before.

685
00:55:33,252 --> 00:55:36,449
Wait till you get a load of this, Mr. Wead.
We got this thing whipped.

686
00:55:36,656 --> 00:55:38,749
Tell me now, what do you see in there?

687
00:55:38,925 --> 00:55:42,691
- Dolores, room 8...
- No, no, no. Down here, down here.

688
00:55:42,862 --> 00:55:44,727
- Can you see this?
- Yeah.

689
00:55:44,897 --> 00:55:47,491
All right, take a look at this.
Do you see your big pinkie?

690
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:49,328
- Yes.
- All right, keep your eye on it.

691
00:55:49,502 --> 00:55:52,630
Now, let's get started.
Come on, same old thing.

692
00:55:52,805 --> 00:55:54,796
I'm gonna move that toe. Go ahead.

693
00:55:54,974 --> 00:55:57,772
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Right. Say it.

694
00:55:57,944 --> 00:56:00,708
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Come on, mean it.

695
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,644
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- That's right, now.

696
00:56:03,816 --> 00:56:06,751
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Go ahead.

697
00:56:06,919 --> 00:56:09,820
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Right.

698
00:56:09,989 --> 00:56:12,822
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Right.

699
00:56:12,992 --> 00:56:15,756
<i>- I'm gonna move that toe</i>
<i>- That's right</i>

700
00:56:15,928 --> 00:56:18,590
<i>- I'm gonna move that toe</i>
- One more chorus.

701
00:56:18,765 --> 00:56:21,325
<i>- I'm gonna move that toe, old boy</i>
- Go, Mr. Wead.

702
00:56:21,501 --> 00:56:23,992
<i>- I'm gonna move that toe</i>
- There you go.

703
00:56:24,203 --> 00:56:26,797
<i>- I'm gonna move that toe, old boy</i>
- Go ahead.

704
00:56:26,973 --> 00:56:29,601
<i>- I'm gonna move that toe</i>
- Come on, with a little rhythm.

705
00:56:29,776 --> 00:56:32,142
<i>- I'm gonna move that toe, boy</i>
- Go ahead. Go on.

706
00:56:32,311 --> 00:56:34,745
<i>- I'm gonna move that toe</i>
- Now you got it.

707
00:56:34,914 --> 00:56:37,314
<i>- I'm gonna move that toe, old boy</i>
- Let's hear you.

708
00:56:37,483 --> 00:56:39,815
<i>- I'm gonna move that toe</i>
<i>- Oh, you got to</i>

709
00:56:39,986 --> 00:56:42,477
<i>- I'm gonna move that toe, boy</i>
<i>- I'm gonna move that toe</i>

710
00:56:43,022 --> 00:56:45,149
<i>All of God's children got toes</i>
<i>So move it</i>

711
00:56:45,324 --> 00:56:47,349
<i>All of God's children got toes</i>
<i>Let's move it</i>

712
00:56:47,527 --> 00:56:49,586
<i>All of God's children got toes</i>
<i>Well, move it</i>

713
00:56:49,762 --> 00:56:52,026
<i>All of God's children got toes</i>
<i>Let's mo...</i>

714
00:56:52,231 --> 00:56:54,495
<i>- I'm...</i>
- Doctor's here, sir.

715
00:56:55,434 --> 00:56:56,867
Still at it, eh?

716
00:56:57,036 --> 00:56:58,731
Johnny.

717
00:56:59,605 --> 00:57:01,402
You know, you can overdo
those exercises.

718
00:57:01,574 --> 00:57:03,940
You mean, I could kill myself?

719
00:57:04,110 --> 00:57:07,204
No, I'm just saying
you could overdo the work.

720
00:57:07,380 --> 00:57:10,440
Well, I don't care too much anymore
which way it is.

721
00:57:10,616 --> 00:57:15,519
But one of us is gonna give,
either me or that big toe.

722
00:57:16,122 --> 00:57:18,181
You may just be right.

723
00:57:18,357 --> 00:57:21,918
You're sleeping better, eating better.

724
00:57:22,094 --> 00:57:24,324
- Carson.
- Yes, sir.

725
00:57:24,597 --> 00:57:27,532
This is against regulations,
but I feel it might do him some good.

726
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:29,292
- Alcohol, sir?
- Oh, no, no. Whiskey.

727
00:57:29,468 --> 00:57:32,028
- Is it intoxicating?
- No, no, just a little... A few drops.

728
00:57:32,205 --> 00:57:35,003
Oh, no, I couldn't do that.
Well, maybe just a few drops.

729
00:57:35,174 --> 00:57:38,405
In some orange juice. That's not
habit-forming? All right, sir, trust me.

730
00:57:38,578 --> 00:57:40,569
- Keep it under your hat.
- Yes, sir.

731
00:57:41,314 --> 00:57:43,805
See you, Spig. Keep it up.

732
00:57:47,887 --> 00:57:49,650
- How's your patient?
- Still alive.

733
00:57:49,822 --> 00:57:52,052
I'll drop in to see him.

734
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,890
All right, hit it and hit it hard.
I'm gonna move that toe.

735
00:57:57,063 --> 00:58:00,157
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Doctor, sir.

736
00:58:00,399 --> 00:58:02,890
- And Miss Crumley.
- Good evening, Wead.

737
00:58:03,069 --> 00:58:04,502
Good evening, doctor.

738
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:06,763
Well, quite an arrangement.

739
00:58:06,939 --> 00:58:08,998
My idea, sir.

740
00:58:09,575 --> 00:58:11,099
"Dolores."

741
00:58:11,310 --> 00:58:13,437
Oh, by the way, I was talking
to the commander...

742
00:58:13,613 --> 00:58:15,604
...about Carson's temporary duty.

743
00:58:15,815 --> 00:58:17,112
Well, what did he say?

744
00:58:17,316 --> 00:58:20,911
As far as they're concerned,
they hope he never comes back.

745
00:58:21,721 --> 00:58:24,053
- Will you excuse us, Miss Crumley.
- Yes, doctor.

746
00:58:24,223 --> 00:58:26,748
- Carson.
- Yes, sir.

747
00:58:34,133 --> 00:58:37,227
This is against
all medical ethics, Carson...

748
00:58:37,403 --> 00:58:40,736
...but the slightly debilitating effects
of alcohol...

749
00:58:40,907 --> 00:58:44,138
...are more then compensated
for by the physical stimulation...

750
00:58:44,343 --> 00:58:47,244
...and the marked psychological benefit
to be derived.

751
00:58:47,413 --> 00:58:49,244
I was thinking
the same thing myself, sir.

752
00:58:49,415 --> 00:58:52,441
In other words, a good slug of booze
won't hurt him.

753
00:58:52,618 --> 00:58:54,176
I want you to give him
some of this.

754
00:58:54,353 --> 00:58:55,615
- All of it, sir?
- No, no.

755
00:58:55,788 --> 00:58:58,256
A spoonful at a time,
in a little water or orange juice?

756
00:58:58,424 --> 00:59:00,051
- Grapefruit.
- Grapefruit, right, sir.

757
00:59:00,226 --> 00:59:03,320
If it doesn't upset Mr. Wead,
we might have another bottle next week?

758
00:59:03,496 --> 00:59:04,827
- We'll see.
- Right.

759
00:59:04,997 --> 00:59:07,932
- But keep it under your hat.
- Trust me, sir.

760
00:59:18,177 --> 00:59:20,577
I can make better booze than that
in a bathtub.

761
00:59:20,746 --> 00:59:22,976
All right, let's go.

762
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:26,408
I'm gonna move that toe. Come on.

763
00:59:26,585 --> 00:59:28,280
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- That's it.

764
00:59:28,454 --> 00:59:31,617
- I'm gonna move that toe.
- Move it.

765
00:59:33,159 --> 00:59:38,324
I'm gonna move that toe.
I'm gonna move that toe.

766
00:59:38,698 --> 00:59:41,496
I'm gonna move that toe.

767
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:46,627
I'm gonna move that toe.
I'm gonna move that toe.

768
00:59:46,806 --> 00:59:49,104
I'm gonna move that toe.

769
00:59:49,275 --> 00:59:54,076
I'm gonna move that toe.
I'm gonna move that toe.

770
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:59,110
I'm gonna move that toe. I've got to.

771
00:59:59,285 --> 01:00:01,344
I'm gonna move that toe.

772
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:05,422
I'm gonna move that toe. I've got to.

773
01:00:06,459 --> 01:00:11,260
I'm gonna move that toe.
I'm gonna move that toe.

774
01:00:11,430 --> 01:00:13,955
I'm gonna move that toe.

775
01:00:14,133 --> 01:00:16,124
I'm gonna move that toe.

776
01:00:17,169 --> 01:00:21,731
I gotta move that toe.
I've gotta move it.

777
01:00:22,241 --> 01:00:26,974
I gotta move that toe.
I gotta move that toe.

778
01:00:27,980 --> 01:00:29,914
I gotta move that toe.

779
01:00:30,549 --> 01:00:31,743
I'm gonna move it.

780
01:00:32,251 --> 01:00:34,378
I gotta move it.

781
01:00:36,355 --> 01:00:39,256
- More?
- Please.

782
01:00:42,395 --> 01:00:45,523
Now, you enjoy that nice fresh air.

783
01:01:11,791 --> 01:01:14,123
- His wife.
- All right.

784
01:01:15,594 --> 01:01:19,394
Good morning. Well, look at you.
Pretty soft.

785
01:01:19,565 --> 01:01:22,398
All you gotta do is lay there,
look at the children in the park.

786
01:01:22,568 --> 01:01:25,401
- Pretty ships out in the bay.
- What are the men with legs doing?

787
01:01:25,571 --> 01:01:27,630
Oh, they're trying to learn
to use their heads.

788
01:01:27,807 --> 01:01:31,265
The millionaires are back from Florida,
and the bums are out of the poolrooms.

789
01:01:31,444 --> 01:01:34,607
- What are you reading? Dames, murder?
- Love.

790
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:36,077
- Who?
- Lousy.

791
01:01:36,248 --> 01:01:38,648
He writes like he'd used my big toe
for a pencil.

792
01:01:38,851 --> 01:01:40,978
You don't like any of the books
I bring, do you?

793
01:01:41,153 --> 01:01:43,053
Not even the one I swiped
from the chaplain.

794
01:01:43,222 --> 01:01:45,156
You know, the one that was banned
in Boston?

795
01:01:45,324 --> 01:01:47,986
You don't like it, why don't you
try writing some yourself?

796
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:51,220
- It's not a bad idea.
- No pictures.

797
01:01:51,397 --> 01:01:54,730
You know, as far as I can make out,
writing is just like telling lies...

798
01:01:54,900 --> 01:01:56,800
...only they wrap it up in fancy paper.

799
01:01:56,969 --> 01:01:59,995
You are about the world's greatest
natural-born liar I ever met...

800
01:02:00,172 --> 01:02:01,901
...so why don't you try it?

801
01:02:03,776 --> 01:02:05,505
- Eight months.
- Oh, quit bellyaching.

802
01:02:05,678 --> 01:02:08,442
Eight months,
and it seems like eight years.

803
01:02:08,614 --> 01:02:11,981
What are you crying about?
You were 4-1 not to be here at all.

804
01:02:12,151 --> 01:02:14,711
You were about 100-1
never to be puffing on a cigarette...

805
01:02:14,887 --> 01:02:18,482
...and about 500-1 not to be propped
up here like the Sultan of Pandemonia.

806
01:02:18,657 --> 01:02:21,854
And a million-to-one not to be able to sign
your name on your paycheck.

807
01:02:22,061 --> 01:02:26,691
Which, incidentally, after the allotment for
your wife and the kids, came to 94 bucks.

808
01:02:26,866 --> 01:02:30,632
I gave 10 bucks to each of the charge
accounts, which left us 14 fish.

809
01:02:30,803 --> 01:02:31,861
Here you are, sign it.

810
01:02:35,875 --> 01:02:38,605
- I'm broke.
- Broke? You are busted.

811
01:02:38,777 --> 01:02:40,506
Come in.

812
01:02:42,548 --> 01:02:44,140
Well, hello, Alice. Or is it Agatha?

813
01:02:44,316 --> 01:02:47,285
Or is it Dolores?
No, it couldn't be Dolores.

814
01:02:55,227 --> 01:02:57,718
Hey, that's not bad.

815
01:02:58,130 --> 01:02:59,529
That's the best yet.

816
01:03:00,099 --> 01:03:03,159
The best yet. Well, let's get to work.

817
01:03:03,736 --> 01:03:06,170
- All right.
- Who sent the flowers?

818
01:03:06,338 --> 01:03:08,932
- Sent what?
- Those red roses.

819
01:03:09,108 --> 01:03:12,009
Don't look at me. I'm not in the habit
of sending flowers to men.

820
01:03:12,178 --> 01:03:15,978
Let me know when you can see it. Okay?
Now, what we gotta do is concentrate.

821
01:03:16,148 --> 01:03:18,343
- Was there a card in them?
- No, there was no card.

822
01:03:18,517 --> 01:03:20,382
Okay, now, when you think...

823
01:03:20,553 --> 01:03:23,818
- Are you sure there was no card in them?
- I told you there was no card.

824
01:03:23,989 --> 01:03:25,684
Use your brain for a generator, right?

825
01:03:25,858 --> 01:03:30,056
Let's push that power all the way down,
right down here to these feeder nerves.

826
01:03:30,229 --> 01:03:32,823
Right... Right in here. Okay?
Got the idea?

827
01:03:32,998 --> 01:03:34,590
All right, now, let's concentrate.

828
01:03:34,767 --> 01:03:37,634
That's it, that's the idea...

829
01:03:37,870 --> 01:03:40,771
- It moved.
- It what?

830
01:03:40,940 --> 01:03:43,636
Mis... Mr. Wead, I...
I saw...

831
01:03:43,809 --> 01:03:45,470
The foot. Do it again.

832
01:03:45,644 --> 01:03:48,511
- What?
- It move... Move... It... Hey, nurse.

833
01:03:48,681 --> 01:03:51,081
Doctor. Anybo...

834
01:03:52,017 --> 01:03:55,748
He moved.
He moved his toe, Miss Crumley.

835
01:04:11,804 --> 01:04:15,262
Why do you always have her husband
coming through the door with a gun?

836
01:04:15,541 --> 01:04:17,702
Did the guy ever get away with it?

837
01:04:17,876 --> 01:04:20,401
I'd have been dead a long time ago.

838
01:04:22,848 --> 01:04:24,975
- You're late.
- Here you are. Right off the boat.

839
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:26,777
Scraped off.

840
01:04:27,686 --> 01:04:30,985
Hi, Mr. Wead.
Gee, you look great. Just great.

841
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:33,658
- Thanks.
- Sitting up in bed and everything.

842
01:04:33,826 --> 01:04:39,093
Still writing them stories?
Arab sheiks, murder?

843
01:05:22,274 --> 01:05:24,333
Now I believe in miracles.

844
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:28,105
That's all that happens. Except there.

845
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:29,679
What's that, Spig?

846
01:05:29,848 --> 01:05:34,148
Twenty for 20:
20 stories, 20 rejections.

847
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:37,016
I'm batting.000.

848
01:05:37,189 --> 01:05:39,248
But you're batting.

849
01:05:39,992 --> 01:05:44,452
Let's have it straight, doc.
You gonna retire me?

850
01:05:44,763 --> 01:05:46,253
I'm afraid I am.

851
01:05:46,799 --> 01:05:48,824
But we've got some good news
for you, Spig.

852
01:05:49,001 --> 01:05:50,832
Good news.

853
01:05:57,276 --> 01:05:59,870
Here you are, sir. Wheels for legs.

854
01:06:05,050 --> 01:06:09,248
- Doctor, permission, please.
- Miss Crumley has made a request...

855
01:06:09,421 --> 01:06:12,185
...which is strictly
against naval regulations.

856
01:06:12,358 --> 01:06:16,818
- But if my colleague concurs...
- Oh, by all means, doctor.

857
01:06:16,995 --> 01:06:19,259
- Permission granted.
- Thank you, doctor.

858
01:06:19,431 --> 01:06:23,060
This is elderberry wine
that my aunt made back in Wisconsin.

859
01:06:23,235 --> 01:06:26,534
Especially for this occasion.

860
01:06:26,705 --> 01:06:31,506
Miss Crumley, thanks. Thanks.

861
01:07:02,875 --> 01:07:04,775
Wind...

862
01:07:05,310 --> 01:07:07,403
...sky...

863
01:07:07,713 --> 01:07:08,737
...and sea.

864
01:07:08,914 --> 01:07:11,439
And elderberry wine.

865
01:07:11,884 --> 01:07:13,647
Simple things, eh, Jughead?

866
01:07:14,253 --> 01:07:16,221
Sheer poetry.

867
01:07:16,755 --> 01:07:18,814
Now, Mr. Wead, sit back
and close your eyes.

868
01:07:18,991 --> 01:07:21,824
- What for?
- Because I said so.

869
01:07:23,495 --> 01:07:25,156
Take a look.

870
01:07:27,933 --> 01:07:29,662
The <i>Saratoga</i>.

871
01:07:31,003 --> 01:07:35,167
- The first real carrier.
- Yep. Pretty, ain't she?

872
01:07:35,841 --> 01:07:38,742
She's a beautiful lady.

873
01:08:01,633 --> 01:08:02,964
Who's upstairs?

874
01:08:03,135 --> 01:08:05,933
Mr. Price. That's his squadron.

875
01:08:06,104 --> 01:08:08,265
They've been out on maneuvers.

876
01:08:10,309 --> 01:08:12,800
- Take me back.
- What?

877
01:08:12,978 --> 01:08:15,412
I said, take me back.

878
01:08:18,350 --> 01:08:20,215
As you say, Mr. Wead.

879
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:23,517
Let me have that tape.
Right. Thank you.

880
01:08:23,689 --> 01:08:26,783
Okay, Arizona, let's go.

881
01:08:26,959 --> 01:08:28,984
Right there. Hold it. Right there.

882
01:08:29,161 --> 01:08:31,322
- Okay, sir.
- Here you go.

883
01:08:31,497 --> 01:08:35,194
Hold that one.
All right, sir, up you go now. One.

884
01:08:35,367 --> 01:08:37,699
All right, Pincus, heave at it.
There we go.

885
01:08:38,003 --> 01:08:40,164
That's it. That's it.
Take it easy up there, sir.

886
01:08:40,339 --> 01:08:42,068
- All right?
- Right.

887
01:08:42,241 --> 01:08:46,075
All right, sir, here's yesterday's mark.
Now, let's try and pass that one today.

888
01:08:46,245 --> 01:08:47,644
Okay.

889
01:08:47,813 --> 01:08:50,646
Come on, pick them up,
lay them down. That's it. One.

890
01:08:50,816 --> 01:08:52,374
Let's try with the other one.

891
01:08:52,551 --> 01:08:54,985
- Oh, Mr. Wead.
- That's it. Try with the other one.

892
01:08:55,153 --> 01:08:57,018
Stand on it.
I don't see you with crutches.

893
01:08:57,189 --> 01:08:59,180
- Come on, try.
- Stand up on them, sir.

894
01:08:59,358 --> 01:09:01,758
Come on, pick them up. Lay...
Shut up, Pincus.

895
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:04,394
Pick them up and lay them down.
Listen to me, Mr. Wead.

896
01:09:04,563 --> 01:09:05,996
- That's it.
- That's it. One more.

897
01:09:06,164 --> 01:09:07,927
- I can't make...
- Come on, sure you can.

898
01:09:08,100 --> 01:09:10,625
No distance to go at all.
We did this yesterday, come on.

899
01:09:10,802 --> 01:09:13,270
- You're doing beautifully.
- Pick them up, lay them down.

900
01:09:13,438 --> 01:09:15,736
Come on. That's it.
Stand on that one, Mr. Wead.

901
01:09:15,908 --> 01:09:18,570
That's it. Don't cheat with
those crutches, I'm telling you.

902
01:09:18,744 --> 01:09:20,507
- That was wonderful.
- That's it.

903
01:09:20,679 --> 01:09:23,705
Pick them up, lay them down.
That's it. Pick them up, lay them down.

904
01:09:23,882 --> 01:09:26,612
Just say it to yourself.
Pick it up and lay it down.

905
01:09:26,785 --> 01:09:28,844
Pick it up... That's it. And one more.

906
01:09:29,021 --> 01:09:31,421
Hold on right there.
Give me another piece of tape.

907
01:09:31,590 --> 01:09:34,423
That's yesterday's mark.
Now, today, here's where we go today.

908
01:09:34,593 --> 01:09:36,925
- No, I think that...
- You're gonna make it. Come on.

909
01:09:37,095 --> 01:09:38,858
- Come on, Mr. Wead.
- Come on.

910
01:09:39,031 --> 01:09:42,296
Come on, pick them up,
lay them down. Come on.

911
01:09:42,501 --> 01:09:44,401
- A couple more.
- Pick them up.

912
01:09:44,570 --> 01:09:47,403
Let's try one more. One more, sir.
One more, just one more.

913
01:09:47,573 --> 01:09:49,370
Just one more.

914
01:09:50,509 --> 01:09:53,808
He did it. He did it. He did it.

915
01:09:58,917 --> 01:10:00,282
He did it.

916
01:10:08,427 --> 01:10:09,985
Come.

917
01:10:10,162 --> 01:10:12,289
- Hiya, Spig.
- Hey, John Dale.

918
01:10:12,464 --> 01:10:14,557
- How are you, boy?
- Home is the sailor.

919
01:10:14,733 --> 01:10:17,566
You're looking good. You're looking
as stout as a mama mule.

920
01:10:17,736 --> 01:10:19,931
Thank you. I'm walking... Or toddling.

921
01:10:20,105 --> 01:10:22,335
Yeah? Say, I brought you
some flowers.

922
01:10:22,541 --> 01:10:24,634
- Red roses?
- Well, I...

923
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:26,801
- Sure. Red roses.
- You brought them for me?

924
01:10:26,979 --> 01:10:28,571
Yeah.

925
01:10:28,981 --> 01:10:31,006
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

926
01:10:31,183 --> 01:10:36,951
Hey, what's this?
You finally made it. Congratulations.

927
01:10:37,122 --> 01:10:39,682
We're gonna have to celebrate that
and wet them down.

928
01:10:39,858 --> 01:10:42,918
Maybe we'd better wait
till I get them paid for.

929
01:10:43,095 --> 01:10:45,086
Say, Spig, did you see her out there?

930
01:10:45,263 --> 01:10:47,788
Yeah, I saw her.

931
01:10:47,966 --> 01:10:50,161
She's a beaut, ain't she?

932
01:10:50,335 --> 01:10:52,303
She sure is.

933
01:10:52,471 --> 01:10:55,998
Travis wanted me to tell you, Spig,
you helped us get that ship.

934
01:10:56,174 --> 01:11:00,304
You can help us again.
We need a dozen more just like her.

935
01:11:00,479 --> 01:11:02,470
What, do you want me
to go back to stunting?

936
01:11:02,648 --> 01:11:05,674
No. But yesterday a man
came down from Hollywood...

937
01:11:05,851 --> 01:11:08,183
...asking about a carrier movie.

938
01:11:08,353 --> 01:11:11,948
He asked the old man,
the old man dumped him in my lap.

939
01:11:12,124 --> 01:11:14,558
I was looking around for the next lap
to put him in...

940
01:11:14,726 --> 01:11:19,129
...when I remembered what you once said
about getting the public on our side.

941
01:11:19,297 --> 01:11:22,858
Getting them to help us out
with the moneymen in Congress.

942
01:11:23,035 --> 01:11:27,131
Well, I figure a lot of the public would
go to see a good movie about carriers...

943
01:11:27,305 --> 01:11:31,799
...so I tossed him a couple of bones,
and he wants to talk to you.

944
01:11:31,977 --> 01:11:35,310
- He wants me to write about carriers?
- Why not?

945
01:11:35,480 --> 01:11:39,177
- Well, how does he know I can write?
- Well, he knows he can't.

946
01:11:39,351 --> 01:11:43,651
Well, I'm a writer without a reader.

947
01:11:43,822 --> 01:11:47,019
That's not exactly what I told him.

948
01:11:51,496 --> 01:11:52,963
Hey, that's good.

949
01:11:53,131 --> 01:11:54,826
Hold onto your hat.
Cross your fingers.

950
01:11:55,000 --> 01:11:57,560
- We're still... Well, hi, Mr. Price.
- Hi, Jughead.

951
01:11:57,736 --> 01:12:00,500
Oh, congratulations.
Your uncle get re-elected?

952
01:12:00,672 --> 01:12:01,730
- The mail.
- Here goes.

953
01:12:01,907 --> 01:12:04,239
"Mr. Frank Wead Jr." That's a bill.
"Mr..." A bill.

954
01:12:04,409 --> 01:12:06,604
- Milford Austin Carson.
- No, not that.

955
01:12:06,778 --> 01:12:09,679
"Mr. Frank Wead Jr."

956
01:12:10,549 --> 01:12:12,881
What is it? Another rejection?

957
01:12:13,051 --> 01:12:16,179
- It's got a different envelope, sir.
- They didn't send the story back.

958
01:12:16,354 --> 01:12:17,685
- Open it up.
- Open it up.

959
01:12:17,856 --> 01:12:19,585
You open it.

960
01:12:23,361 --> 01:12:26,262
- "Pay to the order of Frank Wead..."
- "Frank Wead Jr., 100 bucks."

961
01:12:26,431 --> 01:12:29,332
Told you if you got the husband out
with the gun you'd get lucky.

962
01:12:29,501 --> 01:12:32,299
- One hundred bucks. We're rich.
- May I congratulate you, sir.

963
01:12:32,471 --> 01:12:34,871
- Me too. Congratulations.
- It calls for a celebration.

964
01:12:35,040 --> 01:12:37,372
- How about a drink?
- I couldn't be any party to that.

965
01:12:37,542 --> 01:12:41,069
- I think that under the circumstances...
- Well, under the circumstances.

966
01:12:41,580 --> 01:12:43,480
Would you like these in a vase, sir?

967
01:12:43,682 --> 01:12:46,810
No. Just leave them right here.

968
01:12:51,056 --> 01:12:52,887
To the first story.

969
01:12:53,058 --> 01:12:54,992
To Mr. Price's stripe.

970
01:12:55,193 --> 01:12:57,388
And the red roses.

971
01:12:57,562 --> 01:13:00,156
Pretty good liar, aren't you, Johnny?

972
01:13:00,332 --> 01:13:02,892
And three swell guys.

973
01:13:11,943 --> 01:13:14,207
I'm Commander Wead. I think Mr...

974
01:13:14,379 --> 01:13:16,904
I'm sorry, but Mr. Dodge...

975
01:13:21,019 --> 01:13:23,544
I believe he's expecting you,
Commander Wead.

976
01:13:24,523 --> 01:13:26,286
Thank you.

977
01:13:37,502 --> 01:13:40,938
- Commander Wead is here.
- Dagblast it, Stonewall.

978
01:13:41,106 --> 01:13:42,835
I told you I was at conference.

979
01:13:43,008 --> 01:13:46,171
I'm not supposed to be disturbed
under any circum...

980
01:13:53,752 --> 01:13:55,083
Come on in.

981
01:13:59,558 --> 01:14:01,788
Well... Come in.
Come in, it's good to see you.

982
01:14:01,960 --> 01:14:03,484
Thanks.

983
01:14:03,662 --> 01:14:06,358
Come here and sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

984
01:14:06,531 --> 01:14:08,328
You gotta watch that couch.

985
01:14:08,500 --> 01:14:12,459
It's got a hidden spring in it someplace
that surprises us sometimes.

986
01:14:21,980 --> 01:14:24,005
Watch that door.

987
01:14:27,152 --> 01:14:28,483
Familiar.

988
01:14:28,653 --> 01:14:32,384
Well, commander, I find that
about this time of the afternoon...

989
01:14:32,557 --> 01:14:35,526
...a little drink's good for you.
Good for the pump, you know?

990
01:14:35,694 --> 01:14:37,753
- Here you are.
- I used to make excuses...

991
01:14:37,929 --> 01:14:40,830
...when I drank in the afternoon too.

992
01:14:40,999 --> 01:14:44,833
Funny thing, a man always makes
the loudest excuses to himself.

993
01:14:45,003 --> 01:14:46,561
Yeah, that's a fact.

994
01:14:46,738 --> 01:14:48,763
It sure is a fact.
How are you, commander?

995
01:14:48,940 --> 01:14:50,532
There you are.

996
01:14:52,544 --> 01:14:54,603
Commander of a portable typewriter.

997
01:14:54,813 --> 01:14:56,804
That can be harder
than handling a battleship.

998
01:14:56,982 --> 01:14:59,007
I found that out.

999
01:14:59,184 --> 01:15:01,709
Well, I know you haven't had
much experience writing.

1000
01:15:01,887 --> 01:15:05,118
And none at all in pictures.
But I've heard about you.

1001
01:15:05,323 --> 01:15:09,384
It all sounded like you were just the man
I wanted for a story about the Navy.

1002
01:15:09,561 --> 01:15:12,758
I don't want a story
just about ships and planes...

1003
01:15:12,931 --> 01:15:16,367
...I want a story about the officers and...
- And the men that run them.

1004
01:15:16,534 --> 01:15:17,899
That's exactly it.

1005
01:15:18,069 --> 01:15:20,367
Did you happen to know
any chief petty officers?

1006
01:15:20,538 --> 01:15:22,472
- Do I? Hand me that cane.
- Sure. Here.

1007
01:15:22,641 --> 01:15:24,575
No, I'm kidding.

1008
01:15:25,777 --> 01:15:27,745
Well, I... I want this story...

1009
01:15:27,913 --> 01:15:30,814
...from a pen dipped in
saltwater, not dry martinis.

1010
01:15:30,982 --> 01:15:33,576
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, damn the martinis...

1011
01:15:33,752 --> 01:15:35,242
...full speed ahead.

1012
01:15:35,420 --> 01:15:37,650
- Like to take a crack at it?
- That's why I'm here.

1013
01:15:37,856 --> 01:15:39,949
Good. Come on, let's go.
Can I give you a hand?

1014
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:42,923
- No, I'm all right.
- Oh, I'm sorry. Sorry.

1015
01:15:46,831 --> 01:15:49,299
I didn't know he'd been injured.
Why didn't you tell me?

1016
01:15:49,467 --> 01:15:52,664
Give him that office across the way.
See he gets everything he wants.

1017
01:15:52,871 --> 01:15:55,237
Commander, what do
they call you? Spig, isn't it?

1018
01:15:55,407 --> 01:15:57,637
- That's right.
- Do you mind if I call you Spig?

1019
01:15:57,809 --> 01:16:00,039
- Not at all.
- This is Miss Jackson.

1020
01:16:00,211 --> 01:16:02,270
Stonewall Jackson,
Commander Wead.

1021
01:16:02,447 --> 01:16:05,280
- Hello, commander.
- Hello. Do you mind if I call you Stonewall?

1022
01:16:05,450 --> 01:16:08,351
- Not at all.
- Stonewall's been with me for 22 years.

1023
01:16:08,520 --> 01:16:12,115
She's my barometer.
If she likes your script, I throw it away.

1024
01:16:12,290 --> 01:16:15,282
Wouldn't know what to do without her.
Now, go to work.

1025
01:16:16,528 --> 01:16:18,155
You didn't ask about your salary.

1026
01:16:18,330 --> 01:16:20,764
Well, I figure you'll
pay me what I'm worth.

1027
01:16:20,932 --> 01:16:24,026
What you have to worry about
is that I'm worth what you pay me.

1028
01:16:24,202 --> 01:16:27,831
- It's a deal.
- Well, wait a minute. Is...? Is that all?

1029
01:16:28,006 --> 01:16:29,940
Well, what do you need?
Pencil and paper?

1030
01:16:30,108 --> 01:16:34,169
- Well, what do I write about?
- People. Navy people.

1031
01:16:50,729 --> 01:16:53,357
<i>Hey, what's the big idea?</i>

1032
01:16:55,500 --> 01:16:57,559
<i>Laugh that off, will you?</i>

1033
01:16:57,736 --> 01:16:59,829
<i>Hey, what's the idea?</i>
<i>That was on the level.</i>

1034
01:17:00,005 --> 01:17:02,371
<i>It was. I came down</i>
<i>here to knock your block off.</i>

1035
01:17:02,540 --> 01:17:05,134
<i>- Oh, yeah?</i>
<i>- Yeah.</i>

1036
01:17:05,343 --> 01:17:07,243
<i>That's it. Fight.</i>

1037
01:17:07,412 --> 01:17:08,970
<i>Fight.</i>

1038
01:17:37,409 --> 01:17:39,570
<i>Get out of here.</i>

1039
01:17:43,782 --> 01:17:46,182
- Well, that was very...
- Oh, nice work.

1040
01:17:46,351 --> 01:17:49,013
Tell George that was
a good job of directing.

1041
01:17:49,187 --> 01:17:50,552
Congratulations, commander.

1042
01:17:50,722 --> 01:17:55,887
- How'd you like that kid with Beery?
- Great. Sign him up.

1043
01:17:59,097 --> 01:18:01,930
Spig, I've been thinking
about that title, <i>Hell Divers</i>.

1044
01:18:02,100 --> 01:18:05,467
Great title. Of course, we'll have
to take it up with the Hays Office.

1045
01:18:05,637 --> 01:18:08,401
You can't say "hell"
on the screen, you know.

1046
01:18:10,508 --> 01:18:12,874
Listen, Spig. You might
just as well face it.

1047
01:18:13,044 --> 01:18:15,274
Writing is the loneliest job
in the world.

1048
01:18:15,447 --> 01:18:16,812
There's nobody there but you.

1049
01:18:17,015 --> 01:18:19,210
And I'll give you 50...
I'll give you 100-1...

1050
01:18:19,384 --> 01:18:21,909
...your play won't be a success.

1051
01:18:22,387 --> 01:18:24,446
- You're not listening to me.
- Do you blame me?

1052
01:18:25,323 --> 01:18:26,950
Not a bit.

1053
01:18:27,125 --> 01:18:30,754
Spig, I know the stage,
I know the screen.

1054
01:18:30,929 --> 01:18:36,162
I've toured every tank town from East
Burlap, Maine, to West Burlap, Oregon.

1055
01:18:36,334 --> 01:18:38,461
I even played in this thing once.

1056
01:18:38,636 --> 01:18:40,160
<i>- Ulysses</i>?
- Yep.

1057
01:18:40,405 --> 01:18:42,032
You played in <i>Ulysses</i>?

1058
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,731
Bowling Green, Kentucky.
I played Robert E. Lee.

1059
01:18:44,909 --> 01:18:48,072
Look, Spig, you got a beautiful home here,
half paid for, half empty.

1060
01:18:48,246 --> 01:18:51,511
But no, you got to go
to New York and do a play.

1061
01:18:51,683 --> 01:18:55,483
I'll give you 1000-1 you'll have
the worst flop that ever hits Broadway.

1062
01:19:11,636 --> 01:19:14,434
- Nice going, Mr. Wead.
- Thanks, Joe.

1063
01:19:19,077 --> 01:19:21,136
Looks like you got a hit.

1064
01:19:21,312 --> 01:19:24,008
- Jughead.
- Yes, sir. Carson, late of the U.S. Navy.

1065
01:19:24,182 --> 01:19:26,207
I thought you were running
a chicken farm.

1066
01:19:26,384 --> 01:19:29,012
I was running one. I gave it up.
Chickens get up too early.

1067
01:19:29,187 --> 01:19:32,350
Early to bed, early to rise.
Might as well be dead.

1068
01:19:32,891 --> 01:19:34,449
Big playwright now, huh?

1069
01:19:34,626 --> 01:19:36,526
Rich as Croesus.

1070
01:19:36,694 --> 01:19:40,460
Never could find time to drop a guy a line,
though. Not even a Christmas card.

1071
01:19:40,632 --> 01:19:44,625
- Okay, Carson. So I'm a stuffed shirt.
- That's right.

1072
01:19:44,802 --> 01:19:46,429
- So I'm a horse's rump.
- Correct.

1073
01:19:46,604 --> 01:19:47,764
Well, that was yesterday.

1074
01:19:47,939 --> 01:19:49,998
- Where are we going?
- We're going to a saloon.

1075
01:19:50,375 --> 01:19:51,569
Where else?

1076
01:19:52,610 --> 01:19:55,875
This chicken ranch of mine was six miles
from my nearest neighbor.

1077
01:19:56,047 --> 01:19:59,414
She was a Polish lady
that weighed 258 pounds.

1078
01:19:59,617 --> 01:20:02,609
And when she started
looking good to me, I blew.

1079
01:20:03,621 --> 01:20:05,418
What are you gonna do
with all your loot?

1080
01:20:05,590 --> 01:20:07,581
- You know who it's for.
- For who?

1081
01:20:07,759 --> 01:20:09,192
The kids. Who else?

1082
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:12,090
- How are they doing?
- Well, they're both in school.

1083
01:20:12,263 --> 01:20:14,254
But I'm gonna get them
out there with me.

1084
01:20:20,872 --> 01:20:23,170
How old can we get?

1085
01:20:24,042 --> 01:20:26,033
You ever hear from her?

1086
01:20:26,878 --> 01:20:28,277
She's doing fine.

1087
01:20:28,446 --> 01:20:30,676
Has a job in San Francisco...

1088
01:20:30,848 --> 01:20:32,611
...and she's happy.

1089
01:20:32,784 --> 01:20:35,844
- Is she married?
- Yes. To me.

1090
01:20:36,421 --> 01:20:38,412
Well, you're gonna get the kids,
why not her?

1091
01:20:38,590 --> 01:20:41,218
Buy yourself a yacht.
Take a trip around the world.

1092
01:20:41,426 --> 01:20:42,916
I'll sail it for you.

1093
01:20:43,094 --> 01:20:45,289
I'm no good for her.

1094
01:20:45,897 --> 01:20:49,264
I can remember when they gave you
two chances to live: Slim and none.

1095
01:20:49,434 --> 01:20:50,958
But you made it.

1096
01:20:51,135 --> 01:20:53,797
And I can remember you had
two crutches and 14 bucks...

1097
01:20:53,972 --> 01:20:55,872
...which you parlayed into a fortune.

1098
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:59,942
Of course, that's before you
became fat and baldheaded.

1099
01:21:00,111 --> 01:21:03,205
Them days all you ever asked for
was a chance.

1100
01:21:03,381 --> 01:21:05,611
Do you think I've got
a chance with her?

1101
01:21:05,783 --> 01:21:08,047
Well, what makes you think you ain't?

1102
01:21:09,988 --> 01:21:11,580
Come on.

1103
01:21:12,557 --> 01:21:14,115
- Where you going?
- To the airport.

1104
01:21:14,292 --> 01:21:17,989
I'm putting you on a plane for San Francisco.
After that, you're on your own. Here.

1105
01:21:18,196 --> 01:21:20,596
Don't you know rich guys like you
never pick up a tab?

1106
01:21:20,765 --> 01:21:23,734
Come on, we got 46 minutes
to catch that plane.

1107
01:21:42,353 --> 01:21:44,514
Just a minute.

1108
01:21:53,164 --> 01:21:55,997
- Hi.
- Hi, Min.

1109
01:22:20,758 --> 01:22:23,522
Big playwright.

1110
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:27,029
I was gonna call you, and then
I decided to get cute again.

1111
01:22:27,198 --> 01:22:29,462
Here, let me take your coat.

1112
01:22:42,914 --> 01:22:44,848
Cashmere.

1113
01:22:56,994 --> 01:22:59,485
- Here, let me help you.
- No, I...

1114
01:22:59,664 --> 01:23:02,690
Sure, go ahead.

1115
01:23:17,548 --> 01:23:19,607
Well, what are we gonna talk about?

1116
01:23:19,817 --> 01:23:21,114
You heard from the kids?

1117
01:23:21,319 --> 01:23:24,914
Sure. I hear from them every week.
That's how I know about you.

1118
01:23:25,089 --> 01:23:28,024
Your pictures, your plays, your books.

1119
01:23:28,192 --> 01:23:31,958
Somehow or other you always
manage to stand out in their letters.

1120
01:23:32,964 --> 01:23:35,626
- Second-year college.
- Yeah.

1121
01:23:38,336 --> 01:23:40,395
Spig...

1122
01:23:40,571 --> 01:23:42,402
...you mean an awful lot to them.

1123
01:23:42,573 --> 01:23:44,803
Why don't you have them
with you for a while?

1124
01:23:44,976 --> 01:23:46,603
I want to.

1125
01:23:46,778 --> 01:23:48,575
That's one of the reasons I'm here.

1126
01:23:48,746 --> 01:23:51,442
I think you should.
I think they need you.

1127
01:23:51,616 --> 01:23:54,141
And I need them too.

1128
01:23:54,352 --> 01:23:56,946
I need more than that.

1129
01:23:57,121 --> 01:23:58,452
I need you.

1130
01:24:00,558 --> 01:24:02,423
Hard to believe?

1131
01:24:06,097 --> 01:24:07,587
A little.

1132
01:24:07,765 --> 01:24:09,733
Just believe it, Min.

1133
01:24:10,067 --> 01:24:12,092
Don't analyze it...

1134
01:24:12,270 --> 01:24:14,932
...or take it apart or look at it too hard.

1135
01:24:15,106 --> 01:24:17,074
I've done all that.

1136
01:24:17,241 --> 01:24:18,640
Just believe it.

1137
01:24:24,248 --> 01:24:26,409
I don't know, Spig.

1138
01:24:26,584 --> 01:24:28,779
I've made a new life for myself.

1139
01:24:28,953 --> 01:24:33,014
At least I can be what I am
and what I want to be.

1140
01:24:33,191 --> 01:24:37,525
- I've got somewhere. It's small...
- Sure, sure. You're somewhere.

1141
01:24:37,695 --> 01:24:40,493
The kids are somewhere,
and I'm somewhere.

1142
01:24:41,165 --> 01:24:45,192
But we're really nowhere
unless we're together.

1143
01:24:45,403 --> 01:24:49,396
If it isn't a family, it's... It's nothing.

1144
01:25:03,020 --> 01:25:05,284
I don't know. Maybe it's...

1145
01:25:05,456 --> 01:25:08,823
...too late. Maybe...

1146
01:25:48,533 --> 01:25:49,864
O'Faolain.

1147
01:25:50,601 --> 01:25:53,593
O'Faolain. Bridy.

1148
01:25:53,771 --> 01:25:55,363
Bridy O'Faolain.

1149
01:25:55,540 --> 01:25:57,303
The Widow O'Faolain, if you please.

1150
01:25:57,475 --> 01:25:59,466
What are you dressed up for?
Where you going?

1151
01:25:59,644 --> 01:26:02,374
To mass on the Sabbath.
It wouldn't do you any harm someday.

1152
01:26:02,547 --> 01:26:04,412
Perhaps you're going
to confession too.

1153
01:26:04,582 --> 01:26:07,210
I might. And what put that
in your evil mind, pray?

1154
01:26:07,385 --> 01:26:09,080
This room.

1155
01:26:09,253 --> 01:26:10,743
The kitchen.

1156
01:26:10,922 --> 01:26:12,947
And the bar.

1157
01:26:13,124 --> 01:26:15,058
And the ashes.

1158
01:26:16,127 --> 01:26:19,255
And the dust. Unmitigated sloppiness.

1159
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:21,625
- I'm guilty.
- We're both guilty.

1160
01:26:21,799 --> 01:26:23,596
But we're gonna reform, O'Faolain.

1161
01:26:23,768 --> 01:26:25,998
Because in just a few seconds,
I'm going over...

1162
01:26:26,170 --> 01:26:30,038
...pick up that phone, call my wife,
and she's coming here to live with us.

1163
01:26:30,207 --> 01:26:31,697
- Herself?
- Herself.

1164
01:26:31,876 --> 01:26:34,743
- You mean your wife is coming here?
- She is.

1165
01:26:34,912 --> 01:26:35,936
Oh, God bless you.

1166
01:26:36,113 --> 01:26:38,809
And God bless her
for her foolishness.

1167
01:26:39,116 --> 01:26:42,381
The poor girl.
I'll say me beads for her.

1168
01:26:54,832 --> 01:26:56,561
Long distance?

1169
01:26:56,734 --> 01:27:00,135
I want San Francisco.

1170
01:27:00,304 --> 01:27:04,434
Sutter 23969.

1171
01:27:04,609 --> 01:27:07,100
Crestview 4510.

1172
01:27:08,079 --> 01:27:09,979
How long of a wait?

1173
01:27:10,481 --> 01:27:14,918
Yes, ma'am.
I'll be right here. Thank you.

1174
01:27:41,112 --> 01:27:43,512
The radio. The Japanese. Pearl Harbor.

1175
01:27:43,681 --> 01:27:46,206
- What are you talking about?
- The newsboy just told me.

1176
01:27:46,384 --> 01:27:50,081
- The Japanese bombed.
- Turn on the radio.

1177
01:27:55,893 --> 01:27:58,327
<i>- Appeared over Diamond Head</i>
<i>and launched an attack...</i>

1178
01:27:58,496 --> 01:28:01,192
<i>... on the giant U.S. Naval base</i>
<i>at Pearl Harbor.</i>

1179
01:28:01,365 --> 01:28:03,663
<i>The planes appeared</i>
<i>utterly without warning...</i>

1180
01:28:03,834 --> 01:28:05,859
<i>... apparently coming from</i>
<i>aircraft carriers...</i>

1181
01:28:06,037 --> 01:28:08,164
<i>... which had been moved</i>
<i>forward during the night.</i>

1182
01:28:08,339 --> 01:28:12,400
<i>The enemy craft were over the island</i>

1183
01:28:12,610 --> 01:28:15,704
<i>... bombing the naval base</i>
<i>and nearby Hickam Field.</i>

1184
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:19,372

1185
01:28:19,550 --> 01:28:22,644

1186
01:28:22,820 --> 01:28:25,755

- Turn it off.

1187
01:28:25,923 --> 01:28:29,222

1188
01:28:41,238 --> 01:28:43,035
Hello.

1189
01:28:43,207 --> 01:28:44,936
Min?

1190
01:28:45,876 --> 01:28:47,002
Did you hear it?

1191
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:52,713
I just turned off the radio.

1192
01:28:54,685 --> 01:28:56,414
Of course you'll try, Spig.

1193
01:28:56,587 --> 01:29:00,751
Well, I'll try.
You know I've got to try, Min.

1194
01:29:01,892 --> 01:29:03,359
I'll go there.

1195
01:29:03,527 --> 01:29:05,392
To Washington.

1196
01:29:05,563 --> 01:29:07,463
Talk to them.

1197
01:29:07,665 --> 01:29:09,530
Maybe they won't have me,
I don't know.

1198
01:29:12,403 --> 01:29:14,701
If they don't have you, Spig...

1199
01:29:14,872 --> 01:29:16,772
...I will.

1200
01:29:17,541 --> 01:29:19,771
<i>Well, that's all I need.</i>

1201
01:29:20,778 --> 01:29:23,269
That's all I've got, Spig.

1202
01:29:24,882 --> 01:29:27,749
I said that's all I've got.

1203
01:29:31,489 --> 01:29:33,457
Bye, Spig.

1204
01:29:34,625 --> 01:29:36,286
<i>Min...</i>

1205
01:29:37,762 --> 01:29:39,889
<i>... well, goodbye, sailor. I...</i>

1206
01:30:11,729 --> 01:30:15,165
Stop. Stop. Stop.

1207
01:30:17,868 --> 01:30:20,359
And you want active duty?

1208
01:30:20,971 --> 01:30:23,098
- Combat?
- I've never been under fire.

1209
01:30:23,274 --> 01:30:24,605
You know that, sir.

1210
01:30:24,775 --> 01:30:27,437
- Are you looking for a thrill?
- Just a fight.

1211
01:30:28,045 --> 01:30:31,708
Spig, let's talk like what we are,
old friends.

1212
01:30:31,882 --> 01:30:34,908
Old, I said.
Even a sailor must do it, get old.

1213
01:30:35,319 --> 01:30:37,651
Like Nimitz, Halsey and Pete Mitscher?

1214
01:30:37,822 --> 01:30:39,483
Spig, you know better than this.

1215
01:30:39,657 --> 01:30:42,820
A war gets fought at a desk
just as hard as it does on a flattop.

1216
01:30:42,993 --> 01:30:45,461
It gets won and lost by logistics.

1217
01:30:45,629 --> 01:30:47,722
And I'll let you in on something.

1218
01:30:47,898 --> 01:30:51,163
Every plan that we ever had is down
at the bottom of Pearl Harbor.

1219
01:30:51,769 --> 01:30:53,532
Yeah, we lost our Sunday shirt.

1220
01:30:53,704 --> 01:30:56,172
- That bad?
- Yeah, that bad.

1221
01:30:59,877 --> 01:31:03,745
Now, you see this?
Well, this is sort of a flattop.

1222
01:31:03,914 --> 01:31:08,078
I'm sticking my neck out.
You want one, you can have one.

1223
01:31:09,587 --> 01:31:11,817
I'll try it for size, admiral.
And thanks.

1224
01:31:11,989 --> 01:31:15,481
The name's still Jack. Farrington,
get him a uniform, a desk and a drink.

1225
01:31:15,659 --> 01:31:17,854
He's going to work
for the first time in his life.

1226
01:31:18,028 --> 01:31:19,723
Aye-aye, sir.

1227
01:31:19,897 --> 01:31:21,831
I'm all right.

1228
01:31:25,336 --> 01:31:27,736
The carrier <i>Hornet</i>.

1229
01:31:29,373 --> 01:31:32,536
Notice the hits by enemy action.

1230
01:31:34,178 --> 01:31:36,703
Three kamikazes.

1231
01:31:37,114 --> 01:31:38,809
Two hits.

1232
01:31:40,351 --> 01:31:42,285
One forward...

1233
01:31:42,453 --> 01:31:44,011
...one midship.

1234
01:31:44,188 --> 01:31:45,815
Not a chance.

1235
01:31:46,023 --> 01:31:48,890
Notice the abandon-ship drill.

1236
01:31:51,962 --> 01:31:53,361
Morale excellent.

1237
01:31:53,530 --> 01:31:56,556
We have only one carrier left, gentlemen.

1238
01:31:56,734 --> 01:32:00,261
Repeat, one carrier left.

1239
01:32:00,437 --> 01:32:01,768
<i>Enterprise.</i>

1240
01:32:01,939 --> 01:32:03,406
And more on the way.

1241
01:32:03,574 --> 01:32:04,973
Well, they won't help...

1242
01:32:05,142 --> 01:32:07,269
They won't help now.

1243
01:32:07,444 --> 01:32:10,413
Every battle we fight
depends on the big carriers.

1244
01:32:10,581 --> 01:32:15,348
Yeah, but there's a limiting factor,
planes and crews.

1245
01:32:16,287 --> 01:32:19,654
Can't carry enough. There ought to be
some way to keep them in action.

1246
01:32:19,857 --> 01:32:22,451
- Yeah, but how?
- Well, it's a simple thing.

1247
01:32:22,626 --> 01:32:27,393
It keeps going around in my head
like a forgotten name.

1248
01:32:27,564 --> 01:32:30,556
What do you do when you're
stuck like that, Levi?

1249
01:32:30,734 --> 01:32:33,396
Well, I go through
the alphabet backwards, sir.

1250
01:32:33,570 --> 01:32:35,731
I take a long cold beer.

1251
01:32:35,906 --> 01:32:40,240
Back in Hollywood,
we cut to the seventh cavalry.

1252
01:33:37,067 --> 01:33:39,035
Attention.

1253
01:33:43,007 --> 01:33:44,941
Johnny.

1254
01:33:45,309 --> 01:33:47,140
I've been looking
high and low for you.

1255
01:33:47,311 --> 01:33:48,642
Well, what do you know?

1256
01:33:48,812 --> 01:33:51,337
- Yeah, my uncle got re-elected.
- You got your command.

1257
01:33:51,515 --> 01:33:54,313
- Task force.
- Combat, you lucky dog.

1258
01:33:54,485 --> 01:33:56,612
Say, and you...
I have been calling your hotel...

1259
01:33:56,787 --> 01:33:58,584
...you haven't checked in
for three days.

1260
01:33:58,756 --> 01:34:00,587
What are you doing,
sleeping on this deck?

1261
01:34:00,758 --> 01:34:02,521
- Well...
- I've got three hours to kill...

1262
01:34:02,693 --> 01:34:06,220
...and I got a jeep outside.
I'll buy you the tallest, coldest beer in...

1263
01:34:06,397 --> 01:34:08,592
- You got a what outside?
- A jeep.

1264
01:34:08,766 --> 01:34:10,996
That's it. That's the forgotten name.

1265
01:34:11,168 --> 01:34:13,932
Jeep. Jeep carriers.

1266
01:34:14,104 --> 01:34:16,834
It was there all the time.
I knew it'd be simple.

1267
01:34:17,007 --> 01:34:19,874
Hand me that Liberty ship.

1268
01:34:20,044 --> 01:34:23,207
Give me a chair. Drag up a chair.

1269
01:34:25,182 --> 01:34:26,581
That's it, Johnny.

1270
01:34:26,750 --> 01:34:28,775
Jeep carriers.

1271
01:34:29,720 --> 01:34:32,245
That's the limiting factor.

1272
01:34:32,790 --> 01:34:35,088
Spig, I haven't got
too much time, I...

1273
01:34:35,259 --> 01:34:36,783
Yeah?

1274
01:34:39,730 --> 01:34:42,722
- So long, partner.
- So long.

1275
01:34:44,568 --> 01:34:46,798
That's what we've been needing.

1276
01:34:47,438 --> 01:34:49,030
Johnny.

1277
01:34:49,206 --> 01:34:51,231
John Dale.

1278
01:35:12,396 --> 01:35:14,125
Attention.

1279
01:35:14,298 --> 01:35:15,959
At ease.

1280
01:35:17,801 --> 01:35:21,259
<i>- Soryu, Akagi, Kaga.</i>
- I know all that.

1281
01:35:24,308 --> 01:35:25,434
- Wead?
- Yes, sir.

1282
01:35:25,609 --> 01:35:27,008
Let's have it.

1283
01:35:27,177 --> 01:35:30,613
Well, these big combat carriers
are still the spearpoint of battle.

1284
01:35:30,781 --> 01:35:33,113
But now, backing them up,
we have jeep carriers...

1285
01:35:33,283 --> 01:35:35,080
...loaded with planes and crews.

1286
01:35:35,486 --> 01:35:38,683
If the big carrier loses
a plane, she radios back...

1287
01:35:38,856 --> 01:35:41,825
...and a replacement
is immediately underway.

1288
01:35:41,992 --> 01:35:44,483
The big carrier stays in action.

1289
01:35:44,661 --> 01:35:47,289
- You can get this on paper?
- Yes, sir.

1290
01:35:47,464 --> 01:35:49,432
I like it. Write it up.

1291
01:35:50,868 --> 01:35:52,665
Eureka.

1292
01:35:59,309 --> 01:36:01,777
Cut me some orders, boy.

1293
01:36:09,520 --> 01:36:12,387
- Welcome home, sailor.
- Hello, Jock.

1294
01:36:12,589 --> 01:36:14,989
- How are you feeling?
- Like an old fire horse.

1295
01:36:15,159 --> 01:36:17,627
- Thanks for everything.
- Thanks for nothing.

1296
01:36:17,794 --> 01:36:20,786
Well, there she is. She's all yours.

1297
01:36:22,466 --> 01:36:25,492
Oh, I want you to say hello
to an old pal of yours.

1298
01:36:25,669 --> 01:36:28,001
- Doc.
- How are you, fella?

1299
01:36:28,172 --> 01:36:31,664
Oh, half-man, half-worm and half-wit.

1300
01:36:31,842 --> 01:36:34,709
Well, I got the last chapter
of the book.

1301
01:36:34,878 --> 01:36:37,346
Come on, Spig, I'll show you
to the royal suite.

1302
01:36:37,514 --> 01:36:39,607
Knock it off.

1303
01:36:46,924 --> 01:36:50,155
- Sir.
- Jughead.

1304
01:36:51,762 --> 01:36:53,753
I don't believe it.

1305
01:36:55,999 --> 01:36:57,364
How'd you wangle this?

1306
01:36:57,534 --> 01:37:00,196
Same as you. Drag, pull, juice.

1307
01:37:00,370 --> 01:37:04,033
- I know where the bodies are buried.
- You buried them.

1308
01:37:05,008 --> 01:37:07,238
Thanks, Jughead.

1309
01:37:08,845 --> 01:37:11,143
So you finally made it.

1310
01:37:12,015 --> 01:37:13,880
Come on, let me show you around.

1311
01:37:14,051 --> 01:37:17,418
- I got the crap game.
- And everything else.

1312
01:37:31,768 --> 01:37:34,896
- You look a little beat up to me.
- Yeah, too many soft chairs.

1313
01:37:35,072 --> 01:37:37,870
- Living off the fat of the land?
- The sea will bring it out.

1314
01:37:38,041 --> 01:37:40,566
Well, don't worry.
I'll make a man out of you again.

1315
01:37:40,744 --> 01:37:43,907
And the next time you walk
in that door, sailor, salute.

1316
01:37:44,081 --> 01:37:47,608
- Aye-aye, sir.
- Hey, wait. This is pretty nice, huh?

1317
01:37:47,784 --> 01:37:51,242
You and me
and old Jock and the doc.

1318
01:37:51,421 --> 01:37:54,447
All we need now is Pincus.
Whatever happened to Pincus?

1319
01:37:55,058 --> 01:37:57,185
He made it. Back to the old Arizona.

1320
01:37:59,463 --> 01:38:01,090
- Pearl Harbor?
- Yeah.

1321
01:38:03,467 --> 01:38:06,334
- Hey, you know where we're going?
- I got a general idea.

1322
01:38:06,737 --> 01:38:08,068
You're gonna see some action.

1323
01:38:08,238 --> 01:38:11,298
<i>All hands, man your battle stations.</i>

1324
01:38:13,577 --> 01:38:15,477
<i>Pilots, man your planes.</i>

1325
01:38:15,646 --> 01:38:17,637
<i>Yep, plenty of action.</i>

1326
01:38:17,814 --> 01:38:20,248
<i>You're gonna see island grabbing</i>
<i>the hard way.</i>

1327
01:38:20,417 --> 01:38:22,009
<i>Step by step on the Tokyo road.</i>

1328
01:38:22,185 --> 01:38:24,210
<i>See us pounding away</i>
<i>with everything we've got...</i>

1329
01:38:24,388 --> 01:38:28,256
<i>... and them pounding back at us</i>
<i>with everything they've got.</i>

1330
01:39:30,187 --> 01:39:32,747
<i>Crash on the flight deck.</i>
<i>Crash on the flight deck.</i>

1331
01:39:32,923 --> 01:39:35,619
There's one in on the deck.
They haven't got any release...

1332
01:39:35,792 --> 01:39:39,319
<i>Then we'll see if your jeep carriers</i>
<i>can send replacement planes fast enough...</i>

1333
01:39:39,496 --> 01:39:41,487
<i>... to keep the big carriers</i>
<i>in there slugging.</i>

1334
01:39:41,665 --> 01:39:46,329
<i>Because the big carriers are it, sailor.</i>
<i>High, low, jack and the game.</i>

1335
01:39:55,379 --> 01:39:58,837
Nine minutes, 56 seconds.
You owe me a sawbuck.

1336
01:40:34,284 --> 01:40:36,252
Good job, Spig. Swell show.

1337
01:40:36,420 --> 01:40:39,082
We'd had your plan at Tarawa,
we could've saved casualties.

1338
01:40:39,256 --> 01:40:41,656
When you gonna sleep?
You've been going for 54 hours.

1339
01:40:41,825 --> 01:40:43,884
- I'll sleep after the party.
- The party's over.

1340
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:46,620
- I'm as good as asleep here.
- Captain, make him go to bed.

1341
01:40:46,797 --> 01:40:48,788
- Go to bed.
- No, sir.

1342
01:40:48,965 --> 01:40:50,956
Here's the Oscar, sir.

1343
01:40:51,868 --> 01:40:54,564
We've got them now.
Listen to this, Jughead.

1344
01:40:54,738 --> 01:40:57,901
"Formal resistance has collapsed
on all fronts as of 12:42.

1345
01:40:58,074 --> 01:41:01,009
Vigilance against die-hard individual
action will be maintained...

1346
01:41:01,178 --> 01:41:04,511
...but your commander is signaling
Washington that Kwajalein is ours...

1347
01:41:04,681 --> 01:41:07,081
...and signals each of you 'well done."'

1348
01:41:07,250 --> 01:41:11,050
- A clear path to the Marianas.
- And a clear path to bed for you.

1349
01:41:11,221 --> 01:41:13,519
- Haven't even got under fire.
- Get under the sheets.

1350
01:41:13,690 --> 01:41:15,954
- Captain, make it an order.
- That's an order, Spig.

1351
01:41:16,126 --> 01:41:17,821
I'll fix the coffee.

1352
01:41:17,994 --> 01:41:20,485
No cream, no sugar.

1353
01:41:27,471 --> 01:41:32,170
<i>All general quarters.</i>
<i>All hands, man your battle stations.</i>

1354
01:41:52,362 --> 01:41:56,025
I guess I forgot to stick out my hand.

1355
01:41:57,501 --> 01:41:59,025
Jug.

1356
01:42:00,203 --> 01:42:01,636
Jughead.

1357
01:42:31,568 --> 01:42:35,060
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. This is
a game you have to think, you know.

1358
01:42:35,238 --> 01:42:37,570
- Use my brain a bit when you play...
- Ten-hut.

1359
01:42:37,741 --> 01:42:39,606
- Relax.
- Hi.

1360
01:42:39,776 --> 01:42:41,676
Hi.

1361
01:42:41,845 --> 01:42:43,779
Well...

1362
01:42:43,980 --> 01:42:46,039
...I had to get to battle.

1363
01:42:46,216 --> 01:42:47,410
Pretty near got you killed.

1364
01:42:47,584 --> 01:42:50,553
I'm a Gemini. You can't kill me until
after the 17th of the month.

1365
01:42:50,720 --> 01:42:55,987
Anyway, Frank Merriwell Jr.
Had to see action.

1366
01:42:56,159 --> 01:42:58,423
Oh, you did me a favor.
I'm a wounded hero.

1367
01:42:58,595 --> 01:43:01,393
They're even gonna give me a medal.
I got a month at Waikiki...

1368
01:43:01,565 --> 01:43:04,898
...in the sun and the surf.
Gin rummy. Gin.

1369
01:43:05,068 --> 01:43:06,729
Those beautiful nurses.

1370
01:43:06,903 --> 01:43:09,201
Hey, do you remember the nurse
you had in San Diego?

1371
01:43:09,372 --> 01:43:10,361
Miss Crumley.

1372
01:43:10,540 --> 01:43:13,236
- I want you to meet her son.
- The name's McGuffy, sir.

1373
01:43:13,410 --> 01:43:15,810
McGuffy Crumley.
Put the black king on the red ace.

1374
01:43:16,012 --> 01:43:19,914
- He even cheats when he plays with me.
- Is there anything you need?

1375
01:43:20,116 --> 01:43:23,552
- Yeah, but you ain't got it out here.
- Well, look, Jughead.

1376
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:26,086
- I'm trying to say is...
- You don't look so good.

1377
01:43:26,256 --> 01:43:29,419
- You want I should move over?
- Yeah.

1378
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:33,288
- Well, I...
- Drop in and see a guy, will you?

1379
01:43:35,665 --> 01:43:36,689
Yeah.

1380
01:43:39,035 --> 01:43:40,900
Yeah.

1381
01:44:07,664 --> 01:44:09,291
Jug.

1382
01:44:24,347 --> 01:44:26,372
There it is, Spig.

1383
01:44:27,617 --> 01:44:30,552
Looks like a drunken grasshopper.

1384
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:33,655
- No good?
- Lousy.

1385
01:44:33,957 --> 01:44:36,084
How long does it say?

1386
01:44:36,793 --> 01:44:40,695
Three days,
three months, three years.

1387
01:44:40,897 --> 01:44:42,524
Okay?

1388
01:44:42,699 --> 01:44:44,189
Why not?

1389
01:44:45,802 --> 01:44:48,669
Like to have you
do me a favor, Johnny.

1390
01:44:48,838 --> 01:44:51,398
- If I can.
- Even if you can't.

1391
01:44:51,608 --> 01:44:52,973
Try me.

1392
01:44:53,143 --> 01:44:56,340
A lot of people went to some trouble
to get me out here.

1393
01:44:56,513 --> 01:44:59,676
- I know.
- I don't want them to blame themselves.

1394
01:44:59,849 --> 01:45:01,214
Why should they?

1395
01:45:01,384 --> 01:45:03,818
I don't know why. I just don't want it.

1396
01:45:03,987 --> 01:45:05,352
What do you want?

1397
01:45:05,522 --> 01:45:08,719
You to snip a little red tape.

1398
01:45:08,892 --> 01:45:10,484
Go on.

1399
01:45:10,727 --> 01:45:13,628
I'd like to go over the side quietly.

1400
01:45:13,997 --> 01:45:15,624
Retire.

1401
01:45:15,899 --> 01:45:17,332
Fatigue?

1402
01:45:17,667 --> 01:45:19,191
Yeah.

1403
01:45:20,336 --> 01:45:21,997
Yeah.

1404
01:45:22,405 --> 01:45:24,873
Let them think I was beat up.

1405
01:45:26,276 --> 01:45:28,210
All right, Spig.

1406
01:46:54,230 --> 01:46:56,494
- Will you get a load of all the brass?
- Yeah.

1407
01:46:56,666 --> 01:46:58,759
Army brass too.

1408
01:47:07,844 --> 01:47:11,177
Present arms.

1409
01:47:28,031 --> 01:47:30,625
- Well, Spig.
- Thanks for the ride, Jock.

1410
01:47:30,800 --> 01:47:34,167
Good luck, fella.
That'll do at the side.

1411
01:47:38,308 --> 01:47:40,902
Order arms.

1412
01:48:06,436 --> 01:48:08,028
Johnny.

1413
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:12,831
Thank you, sir.

1414
01:48:16,713 --> 01:48:20,513
- Shorty.
- Hiya, Spig.

1415
01:48:21,885 --> 01:48:23,785
- No cake?
- No cakes.

1416
01:48:23,953 --> 01:48:25,784
And no swimming pools.

1417
01:48:26,522 --> 01:48:28,319
Good luck, fella.

1418
01:48:36,466 --> 01:48:38,093
Salute.

1419
01:48:57,487 --> 01:48:58,886
So long.

1420
01:50:06,756 --> 01:50:08,747
