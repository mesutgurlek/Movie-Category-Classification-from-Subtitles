1
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,076
I'm glad that there is complete agreement

2
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:24,379 
in relation to progress towards European integration.

3
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:27,049 
We have very ambitious plans.

4
00:00:27,149 --> 00:00:29,218 
We are very ambitious country, we are very ambitious government!

5
00:00:29,318 --> 00:00:33,288 
We have a special minister for European integration in our government.

6
00:00:33,388 --> 00:00:40,351 
We are changing the face of our country to become a member of the European Union!

7
00:00:41,330 --> 00:00:45,357 
EU membership is our goal, our vision.

8
00:00:46,134 --> 00:00:49,134 
We want to be part of Europe.

9
00:00:49,171 --> 00:00:52,040 
want to be a colony and open community.

10
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:57,440 
Who in their right mind could wish he could be a colony?

11
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,176 
WEIGHT CHAINS

12
00:01:40,222 --> 00:01:43,058 
I do not think that my early childhood in Yugoslavia was that bad

13
00:01:43,158 --> 00:01:45,227 I have always received many gifts, the family was close to

14
00:01:45,327 --> 00:01:47,429 
and society has seemed close extended family.

15
00:01:47,529 --> 00:01:51,166 
It was a culture in which people were on each other

16
00:01:51,266 --> 00:01:56,071 
they were worried about the welfare of people around them. That in America, for example, no more

17
00:01:56,171 --> 00:02:01,076 
people are alienated from each other. Just work, come home and watch TV at night.

18
00:02:01,176 --> 00:02:04,079 
And we watched television, and we even had a camera

19
00:02:04,179 --> 00:02:06,148 
I am pleased with the film as a kid,

20
00:02:06,248 --> 00:02:10,148 
always tried to hold in their hands.

21
00:02:12,187 --> 00:02:14,156 
What I really wanted was the camera that he kept.

22
00:02:14,256 --> 00:02:16,225 
When my mom took the camera that Dad can come

23
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:18,325 
I changed the story.

24
00:02:20,228 --> 00:02:21,263 
I was a sneaky kid.

25
00:02:21,363 --> 00:02:23,098 
like a cunning fox

26
00:02:23,198 --> 00:02:29,598 
One of my favorite characters decijeg program, "Good night, kids."

27
00:02:30,305 --> 00:02:33,275 
Sometimes my parents to change the channel assembly

28
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:36,375 
where he was even more lullabies.

29
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:13,682 
And as I became too old for these kid stories

30
00:03:13,782 --> 00:03:16,718 
the more I looked forward flight, and every Yugoslav.

31
00:03:16,818 --> 00:03:18,820 
one month vacation with pay!

32
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:23,420 
When I last had so many breaks ...

33
00:03:24,993 --> 00:03:27,829 
We, the Yugoslavs have to have every year.

34
00:03:27,929 --> 00:03:31,967 
But I had not noticed, I was too young during the communist Yugoslavia.

35
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:33,168 
Now I know what you think.

36
00:03:33,268 --> 00:03:35,037 
Communism?

37
00:03:35,137 --> 00:03:38,737 
It is an international criminal conspiracy!

38
00:03:39,141 --> 00:03:41,343 
Well, over the decades before the 1980s,

39
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:45,714 
Yugoslavia prospered with annual GDP growth of 6.1 percent .

40
00:03:45,814 --> 00:03:49,918 
adequate standard of living, free health care and education

41
00:03:50,018 --> 00:03:55,490 
guaranteed the right to work, affordable public transport, housing and utilities

42
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,687 
over 90% literacy, life expectancy of 72 years.

43
00:04:01,296 --> 00:04:08,596 
Most of the economy was in socially-owned, not the private sector.

44
00:04:11,473 --> 00:04:12,407 
Yugoslavia was a special case

45
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:19,414 
jerje establish its own form of the socialist model of economic activity

46
00:04:19,514 --> 00:04:24,519 
ie. mixture of private enterprise and industry

47
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:29,219 
in state ownership with workers' cooperatives

48
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:34,324 
It was considered a success story of the socialist market

49
00:04:34.396 --> 00:04:40,168
Yugoslavia had a higher growth rate than most countries in Western Europe

50
00:04:40,268 --> 00:04:43,405
-developed system of social protection

51
00:04:43,505 --> 00:04:46.274
that was multi-ethnic society

52
00:04:46,374 --> 00:04:48,610 
who lived in harmony

53
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:53,248 
and in many respects, Yugoslavia was a model of development.

54
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:56,918 
You could say that there is something really special about this country.

55
00:04:57,018 --> 00:04:59,454 
And why are people so much blood spilled around it?

56
00:04:59,554 --> 00:05:01,554 
Who is to blame here?

57
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:09,364 
Before I continue, let's see where we are?

58
00:05:09,464 --> 00:05:12,234 
Yugoslavia was between Greece, Italy, Romania

59
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:16,405 
and was populated by Serbs, Croats, Bosnian Muslims, Slovenes and Macedonians

60
00:05:16,505 --> 00:05:20,942 
who are all Slavs, and there are Albanians, Hungarians and other minorities.

61
00:05:21,042 --> 00:05:24,346 
Their country was the result of a long struggle for the unification of

62
00:05:24,446 --> 00:05:27,315 
to show the world what they can achieve when working together

63
00:05:27,415 --> 00:05:31,615 
no matter what happened in the past.

64
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:08,056 
Throughout history, this idea was a thorn in the side of many empires and world powers

65
00:06:08,156 --> 00:06:12,461 
The idea was that the Slavs do not should remain weak

66
00:06:12,561 --> 00:06:18,767 
which divided nations at war with each other or themselves prey Empire

67
00:06:18,867 --> 00:06:23,271 
Serbs lost the freedom percent of the Turks 1389th attacked ,

68
00:06:23,371 --> 00:06:25,430 
the Kosovo area.

69
00:06:25,874 --> 00:06:29,077 
The loss of statehood, which lasted several centuries,

70
00:06:29,177 --> 00:06:34,774 
for the Serbs has produced a strong foundation myth of Kosovo.

71
00:06:35,183 --> 00:06:43,091 
Journalists come to Serbia and wonder: 'Why are you so crazy that Serbs celebrate a losing battle?

72
00:06:43,191 --> 00:06:50,232 
When you talk about the Battle of Kosovo, always tell us how it was a great battle, but you lost it.

73
00:06:50,332 --> 00:06:54,836 
Are you perhaps masochists? Is that something wrong with you? "

74
00:06:54,936 --> 00:07:00,041 
Ai say: 'Have you ever heard of the Alamo? Do you remember the Alamo?

75
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:03,778 
Have you heard of Masada?

76
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:08,683 
Where are the Jews defend to the death and eventually committed suicide

77
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:10,552 
to avoid falling into enemy hands? "

78
00:07:10,652 --> 00:07:16,124 
Because of resistance to the Turks, the Serbs were persecuted and subjected to horrible tortures.

79
00:07:16,224 --> 00:07:25,189 
'We were victims of incredible suffering. We were whipped, lynched, probadani.

80
00:07:29,337 --> 00:07:34,337 
We were rammed the pole. Do you know what that means?

81
00:07:34,776 --> 00:07:43,785 
tapered pole was impaled through your anus, pushed through your body so you walk out the back

82
00:07:43,785 --> 00:07:51,493 
not a violation vital organs. They were experts, Ottoman experts did this.

83
00:07:51,593 --> 00:07:56,731 
So, you were stuck as Christ was crucified on the cross to suffer.

84
00:07:56,831 --> 00:08:00,669 
It was a way to avoid this - accepting the Muslim faith!

85
00:08:00,769 --> 00:08:03,338 
And many do so because they had no choice.

86
00:08:03,438 --> 00:08:09,010 
That's part of the Slavs moved in Islam while the other one kept the Orthodox faith.

87
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:12,981 
On the other hand, the state religion of the Austrian Empire was Catholicism

88
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:16,818 
under whose influence has fallen Croatian population.

89
00:08:16,918 --> 00:08:18,920 
When the Austro-Hungarian Empire annexed Bosnia illegal

90
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:21,790 
and its large population of Yugoslav 1908th The

91
00:08:21,890 --> 00:08:24,259 
Yugoslav dream was more vulnerable than ever.

92
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:26,962 
However, a group of Yugoslav nationalists, 'Young Bosnia'

93
00:08:27,062 --> 00:08:32,067 
which included Serbs, Croats and Muslims, decided to which is much, much more.

94
00:08:32,167 --> 00:08:34,903 
Young man, you may have heard of him, Gavrilo Princip

95
00:08:35,003 --> 00:08:41,003 
killed the Austrian Crown Prince Ferdinand in Sarajevo.

96
00:08:41,142 --> 00:08:42,978 
He later recorded that he said:

97
00:08:43,078 --> 00:08:47,015 
I am a Yugoslav nationalist thesis that the unification of all Yugoslavs,

98
00:08:47.115 --> 00:08:50,151
we have to get rid of Austro-Hungary. "

99
00:08:50,251 --> 00:08:53,788 
Killing them is the heir to the throne, though, angered the Austrians

100
00:08:53,888 --> 00:08:58,159 
and now had a pretext to attack the last stronghold of the Slovenian: Serbia.

101
00:08:58,259 --> 00:09:02,330 
But it was not the real reason for the attack. Austrians and Germans had a plan

102
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:11,530 
to extend their empire to the east. The war was the only way they could achieve.

103
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:16,678 
At the beginning of World War II, a group of Yugoslav politicians

104
00:09:16,778 --> 00:09:19,648 
fled from Austria-Hungary and formed the Yugoslav Committee in London,

105
00:09:19,748 --> 00:09:22,851
to raise money for the realization of the Yugoslav idea.

106
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:26,688 
At the end of the war, the Committee met with the Serbian Government at Corfu,

107
00:09:26,788 --> 00:09:32,560 
and declared that the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes 'the same blood, in language

108
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:37,565 
by her feeling of unity, the integrity of the territory in which they live together

109
00:09:37,665 --> 00:09:40,402 
on the common vital interests of its national survival

110
00:09:40,502 --> 00:09:45,373 
and all-round development of the moral and material life '.

111
00:09:45,473 --> 00:09:48,910 
It was that which they feared Austria-Hungary and Turkey.

112
00:09:49,010 --> 00:09:55,817 
The old world has disappeared poredakje - Yugoslavs finally get our country!

113
00:09:55,917 --> 00:10:01,056 
The Kingdom of Yugoslavia was unfortunately short-lived, because he was preparing a new war

114
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:06,027 
so far unprecedented scale. Hoping to preserve Yugoslavia since the war

115
00:10:06,127 --> 00:10:09,931 
Yugoslavia Prince Paul signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany 1941st The

116
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:12,867 
But that did not like the British, so they supported a military coup in Belgrade

117
00:10:12,967 --> 00:10:17,706 
and popular rebellion against the Covenant. The British were now happy, but not Hitler.

118
00:10:17,806 --> 00:10:24,713 
He was, in fact, was so angry that he wanted to wipe Yugoslavia from the map?

119
00:10:24,813 --> 00:10:27,882 
Yugoslavia was attacked from all sides.

120
00:10:27,982 --> 00:10:34,789 
Yugoslavia was then divided into 12 parts, some of which went to fascist Hungary

121
00:10:34,889 --> 00:10:39,160 
some fascist Italy. Macedonia was granted to Bulgarians and Albanians

122
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:45,660 
and Serbia was occupied by the Wehrmacht and was ruled by the Germans.

123
00:10:46,034 --> 00:10:49,971 
Croatia and Bosnia are united in the Croatian fascist state

124
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:54,209 
under the rule of the Ustasha regime. - This was called the Independent State of Croatia.

125
00:10:54,309 --> 00:10:59,080 
The idea of ??1941. in Croatia was to be a kind of condominium

126
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,282 
for the German force in the Balkans.

127
00:11:01,382 --> 00:11:05,587 
Croatian fascists were quick to destroy all elements of non-Croats in the state.

128
00:11:05,687 --> 00:11:11,687 
Do you know what that meant? Serbs hunting season has begun!

129
00:11:16,431 --> 00:11:19,300 
Yes, Hitler's extermination scheme is applied here

130
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,905 
and the hundreds of thousands of Serbs, Jews and Roma were killed and

131
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:28,209 
most of the fourth-largest concentration camp in Europe - Jasenovac.

132
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:33,212 
A total of 600,000 people were killed in Jasenovac.

133
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:39,320 
Croatian fascist regime, the Ustasha regime, had one feature

134
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:44,192 
that was special, and the matter is that it was the clero-fascist regime.

135
00:11:44,292 --> 00:11:50,424 
Catholic clergy were part of a political dictatorship.

136
00:11:51,065 --> 00:12:01,075 
They were at the top of the government, and were also in the army and the concentration camps.

137
00:12:01,075 --> 00:12:07,605 
They were in Jasenovac. Some of the directors of the camp were the priests.

138
00:12:08,249 --> 00:12:11,319 
Compared to Croatia's inquisition during the Second World War,

139
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:15,957 
Spanish Inquisition look like child's play.

140
00:12:16,057 --> 00:12:23,631 
Pope Pius has supported the fascist regime; peaks of the Vatican knew what was going on there

141
00:12:23,731 --> 00:12:28,736 
On the other hand, monarchists, loyal to the crown, also known as Chetniks, they decided to act.

142
00:12:28,836 --> 00:12:34,542 
The Chetniks were a resistance movement, which, though declared himself

143
00:12:34,642 --> 00:12:42,042 
the Yugoslav army in the homeland, were composed entirely of Serbs.

144
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:48,489 
However, after a bloody German reprisals in Serbia in autumn 1941. The

145
00:12:48,589 --> 00:12:53,528 
Cetnici felt that the continuation of armed resistance by all means

146
00:12:53,628 --> 00:12:57,565 
in a situation when the Germans for one of its dead soldiers 100 Serbs killed

147
00:12:57,665 --> 00:12:59,968 
a straight defeat and self-destruction.

148
00:13:00,068 --> 00:13:03,838 
West did not care about this, they just wanted the Germans dead

149
00:13:03,938 --> 00:13:07,809 
That's all help Cetnicima diverted to fighters

150
00:13:07,909 --> 00:13:13,715 
who have managed to neutralize all the other groups. Yugoslav Partisans!

151
00:13:13,815 --> 00:13:16,651 
Communists, made up of members of all nationalities

152
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:21,723 
led by a man named Tito. 1943rd years, Tito proclaimed a new Yugoslavia,

153
00:13:21,823 --> 00:13:25,660 
which was released two years later. Tito, if nothing else,

154
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,697 
was a brilliant political games with the great powers, which was crucial

155
00:13:29,797 --> 00:13:32,233 
to pull out of Yugoslavia benefits for themselves and be independent.

156
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:36,170 
It's important to say that Tito was not only a leader, he was brand

157
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:39,330 
respected throughout the world.

158
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:49,250 
He was one of the founders of the Non-Aligned Movement. And why were they important?

159
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:55,256 
They were a buffer zone between great powers that allowed this

160
00:13:55,356 --> 00:14:00,929 
to talk about things that are not otherwise could talk openly.

161
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:08,069 
'Tito hopes to continue to walk along both sides of the street - East and West. "

162
00:14:08,169 --> 00:14:11,039 
Tito's firm hand to preserve the unity of the country.

163
00:14:11,139 --> 00:14:15,243 
When he died on 4th May 1980. Many were crying in Yugoslavia ...

164
00:14:15,343 --> 00:14:20,543 
maybe not so much for him because of the Yugoslavia.

165
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:32,920 
His funeral was the largest funeral in history of a statesman.

166
00:14:40,268 --> 00:14:43,972 
Then things started to go turn when Yugoslavia was plunged into debt

167
00:14:44,072 --> 00:14:46,908 
with foreign creditors soon after Tito's death.

168
00:14:47,008 --> 00:14:50,845 
1984th, while the eyes of the world were fixed in Sarajevo where they held

169
00:14:50,945 --> 00:14:54,882 
Winter Olympics, the Reagan administration in a secret document,

170
00:14:54,982 --> 00:15:00,722 
specifically targeted the Yugoslav economy. National Security Directive no. 133

171
00:15:00,822 --> 00:15:04,659
proclaimed that 'U.S. policy to promote the trend of

172
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:06,995 
to the Yugoslav free market economy. "

173
00:15:07,095 --> 00:15:11,766 
That was consistent with the previous policy that sought to force all

174
00:15:11,866 --> 00:15:16,104 
to obtain the quiet revolution to overthrow the communist government.

175
00:15:16,204 --> 00:15:22,804 
This raises a number of other initiatives, most of which are not published.

176
00:15:23,277 --> 00:15:30,118 
Directive simply means that what the United States wants to reach

177
00:15:30,218 --> 00:15:35,089 
that Yugoslavia withdraw from the socialist economy

178
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:37,725 
and become a free market economy modeled on the west.

179
00:15:37,825 --> 00:15:41,996 
While the Soviet system was on its deathbed, 1988., Washington wasted no time

180
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:47,201 
and sent advisers to Yugoslavia from nonprofits pompous name

181
00:15:47,301 --> 00:15:51,601 
The National Endowment for Democracy, or NED

182
00:15:51,672 --> 00:15:55,676 
Good morning and welcome. It's nice to be with you here

183
00:15:55,776 --> 00:16:01,449 
to celebrate the establishment of a vision and noble cause

184
00:16:01,549 --> 00:16:07,715 
NED is a reflection of American faith in democratic ideals and institutions

185
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:11,559 
But Vajnstin Allen, who participated in creating the organization's

186
00:16:11,659 --> 00:16:15,530 
Washington Post said the 1991st that 'much of what we do today,

187
00:16:15,630 --> 00:16:23,030 
CIAje worked covertly 25 years ago', ie. NED is in fact a CIA satellite.

188
00:16:23,538 --> 00:16:28,576 
Instead of the CIA behind the scenes trying to secretly manipulate the process state

189
00:16:28,676 --> 00:16:31,512 
by giving money to the instructions here and there

190
00:16:31,612 --> 00:16:36,684 
They got the lever on the side of the NED.

191
00:16:36,784 --> 00:16:41,489 
So NED started with generous bribes in every corner of Yugoslavia

192
00:16:41,589 --> 00:16:44,325 
by funding opposition groups, potkupljujuci young, hungry journalists

193
00:16:44,425 --> 00:16:47,462 
full of dreams of a new life, giving money to opposition and trade unions

194
00:16:47,562 --> 00:16:50,531 
pro-IMF economists and human rights organizations.

195
00:16:50,631 --> 00:16:53,568 
The National Endowment is also controlled and financed

196
00:16:53,668 --> 00:16:58,539 
the Center for International Private Enterprise, which is still funded by G-17.

197
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,639 
Who were the G-17?

198
00:17:00,808 --> 00:17:02,710 
They were a non-governmental organization consisting of 17 economists

199
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,613 
promoter of free markets, of which three are leading members

200
00:17:05,713 --> 00:17:11,613 
were members of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.

201
00:17:14,088 --> 00:17:18,025 
G-17 coordinator, Professor Veselin Vukotic, closely cooperated

202
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:22,964 
with the World Bank, and as Minister of Privatization in government of Prime Minister Ante Markovic

203
00:17:23,064 --> 00:17:26,934 
he was responsible for bankrotni program that is led by the World Bank

204
00:17:27,034 --> 00:17:31,639 
led to the collapse of the Yugoslav economy in since 1989. to 1990.

205
00:17:31,739 --> 00:17:34,809 
The other members of G-17 work as consultants for the World Bank

206
00:17:34,909 --> 00:17:39,514 
and attend their meetings. 2002nd years have formed a political party in Serbia,

207
00:17:39,614 --> 00:17:45,453 
and since then, although in every election received between 7% and 11% of the vote 208 00:17:45,553 --> 00:17:50.691 G-17 is controlled by the Ministry of Finance and Economics in Serbia.

209
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:54,829 
This is not the only group of economists. It is a network.

210
00:17:54,929 --> 00:17:59,400 
The IMF and World Bank use the network to impose its policy of Yugoslavia.

211
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,035 
And how are they making?

212
00:18:01,135 --> 00:18:05,139 
First, they require the government to withdraw from all social programs

213
00:18:05,239 --> 00:18:08,342
subsidized food and housing, free transportation and health.

214
00:18:08,442 --> 00:18:11,045 
You know ... those things that you in fact are not necessary. Get out of the window.

215
00:18:11,145 --> 00:18:16,884 
reduce public sector spending, lower wages, lower employment,

216
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:19,921 
leaving the workers' self, in other words

217
00:18:20,021 --> 00:18:23,291 
Your people are looking to work more for less money.

218
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:27,328 
Second, economic manipulation, and new laws force companies

219
00:18:27,428 --> 00:18:29,597 
social and private - to go bankrupt.

220
00:18:29,697 --> 00:18:35,693 
The World Bank describes this process as a mechanism for "Shutter."

221
00:18:36,037 --> 00:18:43,744 
That's their term. They say we need to challenge the bankruptcy of the Yugoslav industry.

222
00:18:43,844 --> 00:18:48,749 
Then the company takes a small number of specialized entrepreneurs

223
00:18:48,849 --> 00:18:53,487 
and other powerful foreign economic interest groups. They pokupuju the company for nothing.

224
00:18:53,587 --> 00:19:00,261 
The creditors are simply unable to take the company within 45 days

225
00:19:00,361 --> 00:19:05,600 
and the company has or had to be liquidated or privatizvano.

226
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:10,571 
This is called privatization through liquidation. Records of the World Bank confirms

227
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:15,376 
that the directive Vukotic, since January 1989. until September 1990. The

228
00:19:15,476 --> 00:19:19,576 
over 1100 companies industijskih is destroyed.

229
00:19:20,481 --> 00:19:25,386 
living standards fell by 18% between January and October 1990. year.

230
00:19:25,486 --> 00:19:30,858 
That decline was increased to 20% unemployment, and exacerbated tensions between the republics.

231
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:36,731 
impoverished population is through this comprehensive reform measures of the IMF

232
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:42,203 
which is why there is an increasing social and ethnic tensions.

233
00:19:42,303 --> 00:19:45,072 
So you get dissatisfaction with everyone everywhere

234
00:19:45,172 --> 00:19:47,572 
and all they asked for someone to blame.

235
00:20:07,428 --> 00:20:10,364 
In desperation, the Prime Minister, Markovic, visited Washington

236
00:20:10,464 --> 00:20:15,269 
where he met with President Bush. Markovic said that the growing tensions between the nations

237
00:20:15,369 --> 00:20:18,706 
a result of draconian economic measures and the privatization of

238
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:24,745 
and asked for a billion dollars of assistance, He added: if aid does not arrive, it will be a problem.

239
00:20:24,845 --> 00:20:27,948 
And we all know that Americans did not want any trouble.

240
00:20:28,048 --> 00:20:32,953 
November 1990. year, President George Bush went to Congress in

241
00:20:33,053 --> 00:20:36,957 
where he put pressure to pass the law on foreign spending

242
00:20:37,057 --> 00:20:41,829 
which is demanded that all aid be suspended Yugoslavia.

243
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:46,000 
This law also said that if some of the republics of Yugoslavia,

244
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:52,807 
want further assistance from the United States, must break away and declare independence.

245
00:20:52,907 --> 00:20:56,911 
You understand? This is not conspiracy theory, not my speculation,

246
00:20:57,011 --> 00:21:01,615 
is not my analysis, it is state law. State law!

247
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:03,784 
He demanded that the election procedures and results in each of the republics

248
00:21:03,884 --> 00:21:08,684 
be recognized by the United States.

249
00:21:08,856 --> 00:21:11,859 
Republic was required to maintain national elections are not

250
00:21:11,959 --> 00:21:15,196 
but that the elections are held only in individual republics.

251
00:21:15,296 --> 00:21:21,001 
Of course, the aid would go to individual republics. When assistance is given

252
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:24,205 
it was given to groups that the U.S. administration considered 'democratic'

253
00:21:24,305 --> 00:21:29,610 
that. small right-wing, ultranationalist and even fascist parties.

254
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:36,843 
The disintegration of Yugoslavia was not a consequence of the existing internal divisions.

255
00:21:37,384 --> 00:21:44,483 
These internal divisions have been increased due to foreign intervention.

256
00:21:44,925 --> 00:21:49,730 
Do 1991., Inflation has reached to 200% and the Yugoslav government,

257
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,733 
has been unable to repay the huge interest on Foreign loans

258
00:21:52,833 --> 00:21:55,970 
or arrange the purchase of raw materials for industrial production.

259
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:00,040 
Trust is destroyed and there were numerous accusations from all sides.

260
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:04,879 
Co-operation between the republics and the central government in Belgrade has disappeared.

261
00:22:04,979 --> 00:22:07,915 
Republic did not receive money from the federal government,

262
00:22:08,015 --> 00:22:13,854 
or the Republic sent the tax money, so that the whole fiscal structure collapsed

263
00:22:13,954 --> 00:22:21,996 
and the Republic were left to cope alone, and thus created a new form of nationalism.

264
00:22:22,096 --> 00:22:24,965 
As the Americans are demanding, multi-party elections were carried out

265
00:22:25,065 --> 00:22:30,070 
and the economy was in the center of political debate, and the nationalist and separatist coalition

266
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:33,774 
defeated the Communists in Croatia, Bosnia and Slovenia.

267
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:35,910 
And in the republics that have worked each other on the head

268
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:41,882 
and the economy and the nation are inherited together on the fatal descent. 269 ??00:22:41,982 --> 00:22:47,982 Of course, local politicians have worked to calm the people.

270
00:23:00,935 --> 00:23:05,005 
The people needed a hero to save them, someone who would wear their interests at heart

271
00:23:05,105 --> 00:23:09,076 
Instead, they are obtain these figures.

272
00:23:09,076 --> 00:23:13,714 
1991st, held elections in the Yugoslav republic of Bosnia

273
00:23:13,814 --> 00:23:16,750 
Alija Izetbegovic, who collaborated with the Nazis in the second World War

274
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:20,754 
he was a candidate who had the vision for an Islamic Bosnia mostly Christian

275
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:23,123 
like popagirao in his small book where he wrote:

276
00:23:23,223 --> 00:23:29,797 
"There is no peace or coexistence between Islamic faith and non-Islamic institutions."

277
00:23:29,897 --> 00:23:33,467 
Ali lost the election of a moderate Muslim leader Fikret Abdic.

278
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:37,238 
However, the failure did not stop our Ali, and he made an agreement with Fikret

279
00:23:37,338 --> 00:23:40,174 
Ali to be president, and that a year leave the function.

280
00:23:40,274 --> 00:23:42,343 
However, faster than you can say that the 'Islamic Declaration'

281
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:46,514 
Ali was able to extend its function due to crisis

282
00:23:46,614 --> 00:23:49,583 
Since you can have a fight for power in such tragic times.

283
00:23:49,683 --> 00:23:54,455 
In fact, Ali had a great chance to stop the war, when he signed the Treaty of Lisbon

284
00:23:54,555 --> 00:23:59,393 
1992nd year, based on which Bosnia would be a confederation of three regions.

285
00:23:59,493 --> 00:24:02,796 
Ali did not like this, he wanted all the power for themselves.

286
00:24:02,896 --> 00:24:06,901 
Fortunately for him, the Americans did not like the idea of ??peace.

287
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:12,172 
So, the U.S. ambassador to Yugoslavia, Warren Zimmerman, arrived on the scene.

288
00:24:12,272 --> 00:24:16,377 
My office was at the meeting with Izetbegovic and Zimmerman.

289
00:24:16,477 --> 00:24:20,614 
Izetbegovic has just returned from Lisbon, and Zimmerman he says,

290
00:24:20,714 --> 00:24:26,987 
You could get a lot more recognition from the American If we just wait.

291
00:24:27,087 --> 00:24:30,624 
People in my office told me that at that time Ali was very surprised.

292
00:24:30,724 --> 00:24:33,594 
'If you do not like the agreement, why sign?

293
00:24:33,694 --> 00:24:36,564 
Ali listened to the American advice and withdrew his signature

294
00:24:36,664 --> 00:24:39,800 
solidified his power and Americans have to admit.

295
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:45,739 
Another character who just loved his power, he was famous Slobodan Milosevic.

296
00:24:45,839 --> 00:24:54,339 
Sloba, as people called him, he knew how to use the people and get what she wants.

297
00:24:55,516 --> 00:24:58,752 
With a little luck and the help of his close friend Ivana, President of Serbia,

298
00:24:58,852 --> 00:25:03,624 
Sloba was dispatched to Kosovo in the 1987th where the Serbs felt threatened by the Albanians.

299
00:25:03,724 --> 00:25:08,762 
In the course of a conflict with the police, one Serb was asked why Slobo the police beat.

300
00:25:08,862 --> 00:25:12,062 
Sloba then with the right answer.

301
00:25:14,301 --> 00:25:17,805 
Thus he became a star overnight, the protector of all Serbs!

302
00:25:17,905 --> 00:25:21,575 
However, the case with the police was the only local character,

303
00:25:21,675 --> 00:25:25,679 
This is the character needed larger scenes. Since he was very grateful to my friend John,

304
00:25:25,779 --> 00:25:29,917 
it is removed from the post of president. Ten years later he was killed.

305
00:25:30,017 --> 00:25:33,887 
You may think that Sloba, after he became the new president, calmed down.

306
00:25:33,987 --> 00:25:37,391 
But no, he still longed for a larger scene, and lo 'lucky

307
00:25:37,491 --> 00:25:40,491 
big anniversary was approaching.

308
00:25:41,662 --> 00:25:47,501 
Serbs celebrated 600 years since the Battle of Kosovo, the core of their history and culture

309
00:25:47,601 --> 00:25:49,637 
waved the flag, Serbian, Yugoslavian, U.S.

310
00:25:49,737 --> 00:25:54,475 
and even Canadian, sang patriotic songs ... Sloba climbed on stage to give a speech

311
00:25:54,575 --> 00:26:01,675 
that the West is described as a nationalist call to war, and provoked the crowd.

312
00:26:28,942 --> 00:26:32,713 
Well, maybe I was not so inflammatory speech but at least by opera singers

313
00:26:32,813 --> 00:26:35,913 
after the speech was pretty cool.

314
00:26:37,484 --> 00:26:39,453 
But if you think that this guy had great ambitions

315
00:26:39,553 --> 00:26:45,553 
what you say about the character you are comparing with Jesus Christ ?

316
00:27:05,445 --> 00:27:10,617 
Mother dear. Rescuer of the Croatian people, Franjo Tudjman.

317
00:27:10,717 --> 00:27:16,256 
Opusteno. Francis won the election fair, but people around him were not particularly news

318
00:27:16,356 --> 00:27:20,260 
to cover up what was to happen later.

319
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:22,660 
Even he does not believe any of these.

320
00:27:22,863 --> 00:27:27,863 
Francis government swiftly by illegal armed.

321
00:27:29,036 --> 00:27:31,236 
yes? And what's with this?

322
00:27:34,241 --> 00:27:39,012 
It was as if the war was the only option. However, a large number of people

323
00:27:39,112 --> 00:27:41,448 
has just said 'NO'.

324
00:27:41,548 --> 00:27:47,487 
'We just say give peace a chance! "

325
00:28:01,235 --> 00:28:04,338 
Yugoslavs are afraid to lose a lot if Yugoslavia broke up.

326
00:28:04,438 --> 00:28:08,242 
Fifty years have grown and lived together, got married

327
00:28:08,342 --> 00:28:11,145 
and the center of all this was Bosnia, with a mixed community of

328
00:28:11,245 --> 00:28:15,582 
Muslims, Serbs and Croats-in a word, a small Yugoslavia.

329
00:28:15,682 --> 00:28:19,686 
Mass anti-war demonstrations were held in Sarajevo, which had

330
00:28:19,786 --> 00:28:23,624 
the highest percentage of mixed marriages, with a message to politicians:

331
00:28:23,724 --> 00:28:27,027 
'Do not sacrifice peace for achieving political ambitions'

332
00:28:27,127 --> 00:28:31,965 
But, without much interest in maintaining complete Yugoslavia, politicians have decided

333
00:28:32,065 --> 00:28:35,865 
to send your message to the demonstrators.

334
00:28:46,213 --> 00:28:51,151 
Slovenia and Croatia are first decided that peaceful negotiations can not go in their favor.

335
00:28:51,251 --> 00:28:56,251 
unilaterally declared independence in 1991. year.

336
00:29:02,729 --> 00:29:07,935 
Bosnia was next in 1992. All were soon recognized and west.

337
00:29:08,035 --> 00:29:14,074 
When the White House announced that we will recognize Slovenia, Croatia and Bosnia

338
00:29:14,174 --> 00:29:19,112 
we at the State Department we had no idea what will decision will be before he published

339
00:29:19,212 --> 00:29:23,050 
which is very unusual. I was the director of the office

340
00:29:23,150 --> 00:29:29,089 
no one at senior level had no idea what the White House to decide.

341
00:29:29,189 --> 00:29:32,125 
So we can say that the decision was politically

342
00:29:32,225 --> 00:29:37,364 
that was not based on a careful analysis of possible consequences of such recognition.

343
00:29:37,464 --> 00:29:40,400 
In fact, it was a sure way to conflict becomes inevitable.

344
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,900 
The question was whether people would dwell on it?

345
00:29:50,243 --> 00:29:55,048 
Of course, as history has taught us, can easily be mobilized public opinion

346
00:29:55,148 --> 00:29:58,952 
in favor of conflict and return to the mentality of 2nd World War II,

347
00:29:59,052 --> 00:30:06,152 
in which all Serbs Chetniks, Ustashi Croats and all. Hard-line propaganda!

348
00:32:13,954 --> 00:32:17,583 
Yes, all the propaganda were the same.

349
00:32:47,521 --> 00:32:55,021 
There was no official military mobilization, all retained on a voluntary basis.

350
00:32:58,398 --> 00:33:02,636 
However, a man who could change things, video is what leads to madness.

351
00:33:02,736 --> 00:33:04,761 
His name was Joseph Kir.

352
00:33:27,727 --> 00:33:29,629 
When the Serbs posed roadblocks to control

353
00:33:29,729 --> 00:33:34,568 
access to parts of the territory inhabited by Serbs, Joseph Kir, who was Croatia

354
00:33:34,668 --> 00:33:39,268 
decided to solve these problems in a peaceful manner.

355
00:34:05,999 --> 00:34:12,199 
Kir was becoming an obstacle to the HDZ and had to be removed.

356
00:34:21,047 --> 00:34:25,547 
Who ordered the murder, remained unexplained.

357
00:34:33,059 --> 00:34:37,164 
Yes, the war has begun, and is best described by two words:

358
00:34:37,264 --> 00:34:43,328 
359 00:34:43,737 ethnic cleansing - --> 00:34:47,741 The term, however, is not new in the Balkans, because it was first used in the second World War

360
00:34:47,841 --> 00:34:54,981 
to explain how the Ustashi Croatia cleaned of undesirable ethnic elements: the Serbs and Jews.

361
00:34:55,081 --> 00:35:00,587 
90's memory is to be deeply rooted in the national consciousness of the Serbs.

362
00:35:00,687 --> 00:35:04,724 
Francis did not care for it, because he knew he had the support of the right people.

363
00:35:04,824 --> 00:35:06,826 
German Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher

364
00:35:06,926 --> 00:35:11,798 
in daily contact with Zagreb, the Croatian secession was approved by 365 0:35:11.898 --> 00:35:20,298 and in fact pressured its Western allies to recognize Slovenia and Croatia.

366
00:35:23,276 --> 00:35:29,376 
Serbophobia Germany was in the geopolitical sense of the 1914th and 1941.

367
00:35:30,283 --> 00:35:34,487 
This continuity is also reflected in the favor of the core of almost

368
00:35:34,587 --> 00:35:39,526 
to Croatia and Slovenia, which, remember, belonged to the German

369
00:35:39,626 --> 00:35:44,926 
cultural and state structures for hundreds of years.

370
00:35:45,065 --> 00:35:48,868 
There was a problem in their plan - the Serbs

371
00:35:48,968 --> 00:35:51,504 
that were a constitutive nation in Croatia.

372
00:35:51,604 --> 00:35:55,942 
This meant that no decision on Croatia was unable to pass without Serbs

373
00:35:56,042 --> 00:35:59,012 
percent were Serbs and Croats had equal status. Despite this

374
00:35:59,112 --> 00:36:03,617 
Serbs began increasingly to discriminate against the Croatian government.

375
00:36:03,717 --> 00:36:07,721 
A lot of people were immediately killed or threatened.

376
00:36:07,821 --> 00:36:14,361 
People have lost their jobs. And not only Serbs but also Croats, who were married to a Serb

377
00:36:14,461 --> 00:36:17,564 
were subjected to similar discrimination.

378
00:36:17,664 --> 00:36:23,270 
Francis is all very well knew. And what did he do? He wrote a new constitution.

379
00:36:23,370 --> 00:36:29,376 
According to the constitution of Croatia is a country of Croats. This is an automatic constitutional ethnic cleansing.

380
00:36:29,476 --> 00:36:33,113 
The establishment of this Constitution, Francis broke the Yugoslav Constitution

381
00:36:33,213 --> 00:36:38,318 
which he considered invalid, but he still wanted to preserve the internal Yugoslav border.

382
00:36:38,418 --> 00:36:41,318 
The Serbs had a different idea.

383
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:46,993 
What are Croatian Serbs want to have control over the territories inhabited by

384
00:36:47,093 --> 00:36:52,666 
his government, schools, the right to preservation of language, culture and national identity.

385
00:36:52,766 --> 00:36:55,735 
Croats wanted the same thing, feeling threatened by him

386
00:36:55,835 --> 00:36:59,306 
it is now portrayed as Zagreb Yugoslav Serbo-giant .

387
00:36:59,406 --> 00:37:02,409 
The Serbs thought like this: Well, if the Catholic Croats to secede from Yugoslavia,

388
00:37:02,509 --> 00:37:04,978 
why do not the Serbs could secede from Croatia?

389
00:37:05,078 --> 00:37:08,548 
After all the same thing happened in America during the Civil War.

390
00:37:08,648 --> 00:37:11,718 
When Virginia seceded from the United States, northwestern part of the country

391
00:37:11,818 --> 00:37:16,790 
seceded from Virginia to form West Virginia, which was loyal to the Union.

392
00:37:16,890 --> 00:37:19,559 
When I arrived in Croatia, when we inspect the front

393
00:37:19,659 --> 00:37:27,862 
these people have told me that they were ordinary Croatian peasants, you know, patriotic.

394
00:37:28,601 --> 00:37:33,106 
I was JNAje the terrifying force that they managed to win.

395
00:37:33,206 --> 00:37:38,144 
all the weapons they had, they claimed that they seized from the JNA.

396
00:37:38,244 --> 00:37:43,049 
This story might have to burst at any second, but I looked around

397
00:37:43,149 --> 00:37:46,986 
and since I knew who made some Kalashnikovs, I noticed that the weapons

398
00:37:47,086 --> 00:37:50,323 
that they possessed these guys starting from machine guns to sniper weapons

399
00:37:50,423 --> 00:37:52,992 
Everything was made in East Germany.

400
00:37:53,092 --> 00:37:55,729 
Although Croatia has never officially acknowledged that Germany was arming them

401
00:37:55,829 --> 00:37:59,099 
decided to thank the Germans singing, in German.

402
00:37:59,199 --> 00:38:01,568 
You know, that only Germans can understand.

403
00:38:01,668 --> 00:38:05,238 
Thank you Germany, my soul is burning.

404
00:38:05,338 --> 00:38:09,138 
Thank you Germany, for this wonderful gift.

405
00:38:09,642 --> 00:38:13,713 
If you follow the ball skocica, Croatia has recently donated

406
00:38:13,813 --> 00:38:20,813 
excess of 4 to 5 thousand Kalashnikovs Afghan National Army.

407
00:38:20,987 --> 00:38:25,625 
This is not a surplus, they actually hide the weapon that was used for murder.

408
00:38:25,725 --> 00:38:34,025 
The Serbs had more than enough weapons and could hardly waiting to get into a fight the Croatian army.

409
00:38:43,510 --> 00:38:46,446 
Croatian town of Vukovar was under siege for 87 days

410
00:38:46,546 --> 00:38:50,617 
ended Pyrrhic victory of Serbian forces.

411
00:38:50,717 --> 00:38:55,917 
Why Pyrrhic? Well, because they destroyed the entire city.

412
00:39:03,596 --> 00:39:11,604 
horrific example of how the territory became suddenly more important than people who live on it.

413
00:39:11,704 --> 00:39:14,541 
Even though they were brainwashed, believing that doing the right thing

414
00:39:14,641 --> 00:39:19,741 
Some people have woken up and realized what was happening.

415
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:24,350 
Milan Levar, a Croat who had vigorously sought to protect their town of Gospic Serbs

416
00:39:24,450 --> 00:39:28,388 
among the first to join the newly formed Croatian Army

417
00:39:28,488 --> 00:39:34,488 
but soon disappointed after one orders received.

418
00:40:29,382 --> 00:40:33,820 
His struggle led him to the International Criminal Court where he testified.

419
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:42,720 
After that, however, the extreme elements in Croatia are determined to silence the Milan Levar.

420
00:41:29,976 --> 00:41:31,811 
Instead of building better relationships based on trust

421
00:41:31,911 --> 00:41:35,682 
between the two warring sides in Croatia, 1992. The

422
00:41:35,782 --> 00:41:38,851 
The Pentagon has been busy publishing their imperialist hegemony

423
00:41:38,951 --> 00:41:42,755 
through the 'Strategic Plan of the defense. " According to the New York Times in 1992.

424
00:41:42,855 --> 00:41:47,760
This paper argues that the only option the United States

425
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:51,831 
to impose a complete world domination, adding that no other country

426
00:41:51,931 --> 00:41:57,203 
no right to aspire to the role of leader, even as a regional power.

427
00:41:57,303 --> 00:42:03,476 
The United States simply saw himself as a leading force in a unipolar world

428
00:42:03,576 --> 00:42:06,679 
and thought they could do whatever they want.

429
00:42:06,779 --> 00:42:10,750 
Yugoslavia had to be destroyed. And there was no better symbol for Yugoslavia

430
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:16,656 
of its central republic of Bosnia. Outbreak of the war, the bloodiest conflict in Europe

431
00:42:16,756 --> 00:42:19,056 
after the second World War II.

432
00:42:28,701 --> 00:42:33,439 
Civil war. Civil war is the worst kind of war.

433
00:42:33,539 --> 00:42:37,576 
There are brothers fighting against brothers, families are divided and fighting each other

434
00:42:37,676 --> 00:42:41,676 
It's really kind of conflict najgadnije.

435
00:43:01,567 --> 00:43:05,704 
The Serbs wanted to have the control a territory that was inhabited by Serbs,

436
00:43:05,804 --> 00:43:08,674 
including parts that were of strategic importance for them.

437
00:43:08,774 --> 00:43:13,245 
Croats wanted the same, while the Bosnian Muslims, or Bosniaks, as it is now called

438
00:43:13,345 --> 00:43:20,186 
wanted everything. To achieve this, the Bosnian government, which has increasingly represented the interests of the Bosniak

439
00:43:20,286 --> 00:43:24,186 
began to receive assistance from the Americans.

440
00:43:25,524 --> 00:43:29,824 
planes were secretly landed at the airport in Tuzla.

441
00:43:30,029 --> 00:43:36,101 
The Americans have begun to approve the delivery of arms to Bosnian Muslims.

442
00:43:36,201 --> 00:43:38,871 
U.S. President Clinton later admitted in his book,

443
00:43:38,971 --> 00:43:42,908 
that the Americans failed to implement the arms embargo. But that's not all.

444
00:43:43,008 --> 00:43:46,812 
Ali are also hundreds of mujahideen offered their assistance.

445
00:43:46,912 --> 00:43:50,012 
Come on, who refused these guys?

446
00:43:50,182 --> 00:43:53,452 
The Serbs, on the other hand, depended on assistance from Belgrade.

447
00:43:53,552 --> 00:43:56,455 
Since the Yugoslav Army was the fourth most powerful in Europe,

448
00:43:56,555 --> 00:44:00,392 
The West has responded to halt Belgrade in helping the Serbs in Bosnia .

449
00:44:00,492 --> 00:44:04,863 
So, in May 1992. years, imposed sanctions what is left of Yugoslavia,

450
00:44:04,963 --> 00:44:06,963 
Serbia and Montenegro.

451
00:44:07,099 --> 00:44:12,699 
Until October 1993., 90% of domestic production of drugs is concerned.

452
00:44:12,871 --> 00:44:17,776 
The mean daily intake of calories compared to 1990, fell by 28%

453
00:44:17,876 --> 00:44:21,903 
and 1.5 million people were severely malnourished.

454
00:44:22,247 --> 00:44:27,019 
Two months later, over 60% of the Yugoslav labor force were unemployed

455
00:44:27,119 --> 00:44:36,152 
and the average monthly wage fell from $ 500 $ 15 Markets and shops were nearly empty.

456
00:44:44,236 --> 00:44:51,236 
As usual, the sanctions hit the people lowest on the social ladder.

457
00:44:51,410 --> 00:44:54,313 
People only benefit on top of them.

458
00:44:54,413 --> 00:44:59,218 
They have forced the Serbs to what would have happened anywhere - criminalized economy.

459
00:44:59,318 --> 00:45:03,822 
Criminals have become kings, and it happened for us.

460
00:45:03,922 --> 00:45:08,861 
If you go to Belgrade, where they used to be diplomat, now live fraudsters and criminals,

461
00:45:08,961 --> 00:45:14,566 
who stole tons of money during the war on the black market. - War profteri? - At large.

462
00:45:14,666 --> 00:45:17,803 
Slobo's government has usurped the state financial system, while the citizens of Serbia

463
00:45:17,903 --> 00:45:26,003 
settle on pyramid schemes, particularly those of Dafina Milanovic and Jezda Vasiljevic.

464
00:45:51,737 --> 00:45:56,608 
For them, of course. For both Dafina and Jezda snuck out of the country with the stolen money.

465
00:45:56,708 --> 00:46:00,646 
The economic tragedy initiated sanctions, it reached its peak.

466
00:46:00,746 --> 00:46:03,682 
This has resulted in truly terrible. In particular, the 1993rd The

467
00:46:03,782 --> 00:46:09,588 
rate of inflation in Yugoslavia was the largest in recorded history.

468
00:46:09,688 --> 00:46:14,888 
As I recall, was about 1.8 billion percent.

469
00:46:15,494 --> 00:46:19,565 
They even had to print the notes of 500 billion dinars.

470
00:46:19,665 --> 00:46:23,502 
Lawlessness has spread to the Mafia and took control.

471
00:46:23,602 --> 00:46:28,006 
Despite the chaos around them, the Serbs did not want to kneel down in front of the West

472
00:46:28,106 --> 00:46:30,075 
and one man decided to take advantage of the situation

473
00:46:30,175 --> 00:46:33,512 
to save the one organization that no longer had a purpose.

474
00:46:33,612 --> 00:46:36,782 
North Atlantic alliance known as NATO

475
00:46:36,882 --> 00:46:40,719 
defense-security organization of states that have committed

476
00:46:40,819 --> 00:46:43,689 
on the mutual protection in case of attack by foreign enemies

477
00:46:43,789 --> 00:46:48,093 
founded in 1949. year. The real goal is to become a protection from the Soviets West

478
00:46:48,193 --> 00:46:51,530 
counterbalance later formed the Warsaw Pact.

479
00:46:51,630 --> 00:46:58,194 
President Eisenhower believed that the NATO defense alliance

480
00:46:58,737 --> 00:47:02,608 
you may later retrieve the Europeans. Instead,

481
00:47:02,708 --> 00:47:08,547 
United States have used the organization as an instrument of force and expansion to the east.

482
00:47:08,647 --> 00:47:11,683 
But then the Soviet Union collapsed.

483
00:47:11,783 --> 00:47:18,724 
The United States openly violated the agreement that was made with Gorbachev

484
00:47:18,724 --> 00:47:25,564 
not to encircle Russia hostile armed countries.

485
00:47:25,664 --> 00:47:33,469 
The colonization of Serbia is the main or first step on the staircase to Russia.

486
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:39,478 
We had to be colonized, because NATO is a lesson learned by Hitler.

487
00:47:39,578 --> 00:47:42,614 
You can not at the same time to be mindful of two battles when attacking Russians

488
00:47:42,714 --> 00:47:45,517 
First you neutralizujes to Yugoslavia, as did Hitler .

489
00:47:45,617 --> 00:47:47,519 
But to do this, you have to figure out why

490
00:47:47,619 --> 00:47:51,323 
why would intervene against the enemy in Yugoslavia.

491
00:47:51,423 --> 00:47:53,459 
Meet Joe Biden.

492
00:47:53,559 --> 00:47:58,397 
We are facing undoubted act of Serbian expansionism and aggression.

493
00:47:58,497 --> 00:48:00,299 
This is as much a civil war as they led by

494
00:48:00,399 --> 00:48:04,436 
Germany, Austria and Czechoslovakia during the 1930s.

495
00:48:04,536 --> 00:48:11,336 
This is, as I previously thought, fascist robbery in march!

496
00:48:11,510 --> 00:48:15,481 
It was the Serbs called horrible names, and at the same time

497
00:48:15,581 --> 00:48:20,486 
had a very influential position in the Office of International Relations in the Senate .

498
00:48:20,586 --> 00:48:24,122 
Biden also emphasized the importance of the new role of NATO

499
00:48:24,222 --> 00:48:29,094 
what is seen February 1994. at a meeting in the Senate on the future of NATO.

500
00:48:29,194 --> 00:48:35,200 
Last month, while NATO has confirmed the role of General Staff of the European security

501
00:48:35,300 --> 00:48:39,204 
crimes such as those who were tried at Nuremberg before Half a century

502
00:48:39,304 --> 00:48:42,441 
have continued unabated in Bosnia.

503
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:47,341 
Without a common enemy to unite us

504
00:48:47,713 --> 00:48:54,553 
what causes our conceptions of national interest, could separate us.

505
00:48:54,653 --> 00:48:58,056 
He found a common enemy of the Serbian people

506
00:48:58,156 --> 00:49:01,159 
which had previously been demonize American companies for public relations

507
00:49:01,259 --> 00:49:05,464 
like Ruder & Finn, who hired the various separatist groups in Yugoslavia.

508
00:49:05,564 --> 00:49:12,804 
Not only are demonized Serbian leaders, they have demonized the Serbian people.

509
00:49:12,904 --> 00:49:16,875 
The problem for the Serbs consisted in the fact that they were slow in reacting.

510
00:49:16,975 --> 00:49:21,780 
In the first heartbeat is not understood what was happening to them, and when they understand

511
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:31,857 
that part of the Balkans has already sunk in conflict in which Serbs propaganda meant

512
00:49:31,857 --> 00:49:34,857 
as the enemy of all others.

513
00:49:35,027 --> 00:49:42,234 
The United States soon began to create a storm in Croatia. Specifically, Operation Storm.

514
00:49:42,334 --> 00:49:48,006 
They invented a plan by which the Croatian army attacked the Krajina

515
00:49:48,106 --> 00:49:55,877 
and occupied the area that was inhabited by Serbian people

516
00:49:56,348 --> 00:50:03,255 
who has been there for about four, five centuries, but it was decided that they were too radical

517
00:50:03,355 --> 00:50:06,725 
to help them be allowed to continue to live within the borders of Croatia.

518
00:50:06,825 --> 00:50:11,597 
And, in a meeting on Brioni, Francis gave his blessing to General Ante Gotovina

519
00:50:11,697 --> 00:50:18,897 
the largest single act of ethnic cleansing during the Yugoslav wars.

520
00:50:41,793 --> 00:50:45,998 
The operation lasted 84 hours in August 1995.,

521
00:50:46,098 --> 00:50:51,303 
ended with the death of about 2000, and a quarter million ethnic cleansed of Serbs.

522
00:50:51,403 --> 00:50:57,703 
Slobo and his generals, the guardians of all Serbs, have abandoned them.

523
00:51:03,014 --> 00:51:08,153 
The storm was inspired by the American operations by some of my colleagues.

524
00:51:08,253 --> 00:51:15,227 
The people who advised the Croatian army were retired U.S. generals and officers

525
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,764 
that worked just outside Beltveja in Washington.

526
00:51:18,864 --> 00:51:21,464 
Francis was very happy.

527
00:51:27,539 --> 00:51:32,244 
Because they got rid of the Serbs in Croatia, the Americans turned to Bosnia.

528
00:51:32,344 --> 00:51:37,349 
Just drive out Serbs from there would not be easy, and have applied different strategies.

529
00:51:37,449 --> 00:51:42,487 
presentation of the Bosnian war as civil, which is in fact and was, instead of Serbian aggression,

530
00:51:42,587 --> 00:51:47,292 
meant to west public opinion was brought into confusion, and water would be thrown into confusion.

531
00:51:47,392 --> 00:51:51,963 
To intervene, the Americans had to clarify against whom to intervene.

532
00:51:52,063 --> 00:51:57,831 
The Serbs started this war. Serbs are the original cause of the war.

533
00:51:58,503 --> 00:52:01,506 
They are complete aggressors and perpetrators.

534
00:52:01,606 --> 00:52:06,211 
NATO was used for the process of colonization, but Clinton must know that

535
00:52:06,311 --> 00:52:13,952 
to justify a wider audience. Perhaps the best example of what I say is - Srebrenica.

536
00:52:14,052 --> 00:52:19,991 
Srebrenica, a village in Bosnia, was declared a safe area to the Bosniak refugees

537
00:52:20,091 --> 00:52:23,128 
but never really disarmed, which is allow the Bosnian forces

538
00:52:23,228 --> 00:52:26,998 
to attack neighboring Serbian villages. Serbian commander, Ratko Mladic

539
00:52:27,098 --> 00:52:32,137 
trampled Srebrenica, leaving thousands of Muslims killed and ethnically cleansed.

540
00:52:32,237 --> 00:52:36,875 
What happened in Srebrenica was orchestrated fall of the enclave

541
00:52:36,975 --> 00:52:41,379 
into the hands of Serbian forces who never expected that the win.

542
00:52:41,479 --> 00:52:46,885 
The United Nations has declared this act of genocide, although the UN observer, Philip Corbin

543
00:52:46,985 --> 00:52:50,822 
estimated that the number of killed Muslims in Srebrenica does not exceed the number of Serbs

544
00:52:50,922 --> 00:52:54,860 
killed in the surrounding villages. But it was not important

545
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,830 
Srebrenica is to be used for a much larger goal.

546
00:52:58,930 --> 00:53:02,768 
There are reliable sources within the Muslim community who say

547
00:53:02,868 --> 00:53:08,807 
that they Alija Izetbegovic said that it was Bill Clinton made it clear

548
00:53:08,907 --> 00:53:14,813 
to 5.000 Muslims killed was the price of NATO intervention on the side of Bosnian Muslims.

549
00:53:14,913 --> 00:53:18,950 
They believe that Izetbegovic was deliberately sacrificed Srebrenica

550
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:29,585 
as a scapegoat, which would be an excuse for intervention, and indeed, all so what happened.

551
00:53:30,095 --> 00:53:32,397 
The Bosnian government had no choice.

552
00:53:32,497 --> 00:53:35,700 
Mr. Silajdzic, speaking on behalf of his government, he said the following:

553
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,271 
We have no choice, and our presidency had selection

554
00:53:39,371 --> 00:53:42,774 
but to ask for military intervention in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

555
00:53:42,874 --> 00:53:46,845 
You can not solve this alone, American public opinion will not tolerate it

556
00:53:46,945 --> 00:53:49,945 
allies can not afford.

557
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:54,680 
I followed the intervention.

558
00:53:59,257 --> 00:54:04,329 
NATO, an organization founded with the sole purpose of defending its members

559
00:54:04,429 --> 00:54:09,301 
attacked a country that neither attacked nor threatened any one member of NATO.

560
00:54:09,401 --> 00:54:13,405 
Lewis MacKenzie, who was a Major General in charge of UN Sector Sarajevo

561
00:54:13,505 --> 00:54:17,242 
he tried to warn the Americans in what is engage.

562
00:54:17,342 --> 00:54:20,378 
I appeared before Congress and they have asked for an opinion.

563
00:54:20,478 --> 00:54:25,350 
Ai I said: Begin to train your grandchildren to be peacemakers in Bosnia

564
00:54:25,450 --> 00:54:29,421 
because you will be there for generations. And many of them are still there.

565
00:54:29,521 --> 00:54:33,058 
While heavily armed U.S. and NATO troops imposed peace in Bosnia

566
00:54:33,158 --> 00:54:36,161 
media and politicians have tried to present Western interevenciju

567
00:54:36,261 --> 00:54:41,066 
in the former Yugoslavia as a noble mission, which, although late to prevent the outbreak of war,

568
00:54:41,166 --> 00:54:44,970 
stop ethnic massacres and human rights violations .

569
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:50,108 
A lot of so-called liberal and left-wing or progressive media

570
00:54:50,208 --> 00:54:56,214 
watch the Balkans through the narrow prism of the mainstream. In other words,

571
00:54:56,214 --> 00:55:05,885 
they are fully accepted view of events they offered the U.S. and the EU.

572
00:55:06,391 --> 00:55:12,697 
Only those journalists who have lied and have found new ways to attack the Serbs

573
00:55:12,797 --> 00:55:17,802 
other than those that have sent their editors, different from stories that were written for them

574
00:55:17,902 --> 00:55:21,439 
before they came to the Balkans, such as progress.

575
00:55:21,539 --> 00:55:25,377 
Of course, the bombing forced the Bosnian Serbs to surrender.

576
00:55:25,477 --> 00:55:28,346 
On potpisivnju Peace Agreement, which divided Bosnia into two entities

577
00:55:28,446 --> 00:55:32,250 
Serbian and Bosniak-Croat, all of which were odogvorni

578
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:36,354 
for the outbreak of the war, sang the praises of peace.

579
00:55:36,454 --> 00:55:44,054 
This is Vrhbarje village, near Sokolac in Bosnia, inhabited by Serbs and Muslims.

580
00:55:44,295 --> 00:55:49,267 
After the Dayton Agreement imposed, residents were aware of what it means for them

581
00:55:49,367 --> 00:55:53,204 
and since the village became part of the Serbian entity , the Muslims decided

582
00:55:53,304 --> 00:55:57,504 
to collectively move in its own entity.

583
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:16,654 
This video never before was not displayed anywhere. Simply did not fit into the picture

584
00:57:16,754 --> 00:57:21,726 
by the Western media constantly trying to create the evil Serbs

585
00:57:21,826 --> 00:57:24,963 
to destroy all non-front them.

586
00:57:25,063 --> 00:57:31,363 
Do you think that this forced the Western public to intervene?

587
00:57:52,157 --> 00:57:57,057 
What? The Serbs do not act as genocidal maniacs?

588
00:58:07,238 --> 00:58:09,238 
Human beings? They?

589
00:58:49,881 --> 00:58:52,851 
The human compassion was something quite normal for a young Serb man

590
00:58:52,951 --> 00:58:58,189 
from Trebinje in Herzegovina called Srdjan Aleksic.

591
00:58:58,289 --> 00:59:02,293 
Srdjanov father recalls how Srdjan noted that the Serbian police arrested a man

592
00:59:02,393 --> 00:59:05,293 
on the basis of his nationality.

593
01:00:26,944 --> 01:00:29,814 
This is one of the many stories of true heroism

594
01:00:29,914 --> 01:00:32,217 
which has never reached the Western media

595
01:00:32,317 --> 01:00:37,121 
West was more focused on stirring up conflict so that they can jump

596
01:00:37,221 --> 01:00:41,125 
for their own interests. While the world celebrated peace in Bosnia in 1995.

597
01:00:41,225 --> 01:00:46,030 
international financial institutions have been employed by the collection of debts of the former Yugoslavia

598
01:00:46,130 --> 01:00:49,033 
from emerging countries, while also transforming the Balkans

599
01:00:49,133 --> 01:00:53,071 
in a secure area of ??the free market. In late 1995. The

600
01:00:53,171 --> 01:00:58,042 
West announced a program of 'reconstruction', which had abolished the independence of Bosnia

601
01:00:58,142 --> 01:01:02,247 
to a degree that was not seen in Europe since 2nd World War II.

602
01:01:02,347 --> 01:01:07,318 
It was pure colonialism which consisted mainly of the division of Bosnian territory

603
01:01:07,418 --> 01:01:10,655 
under NATO military occupation and the administration. This form of intervention

604
01:01:10,755 --> 01:01:12,357 
under NATO military occupation and the administration. This form of intervention

605
01:01:12,457 --> 01:01:17,562 
he was so successful that the West simply had to be applied to Kosovo.

606
01:01:17,662 --> 01:01:21,432 
I think that the region is important in geostrategic terms. They see Kosovo

607
01:01:21,532 --> 01:01:28,273 
as a potential country where they could secure their presence in the region.

608
01:01:28,373 --> 01:01:35,073 
But the West has underestimated the importance that Kosovo is the Serbian people.

609
01:01:37,115 --> 01:01:41,953 
My dear citizens, today is our armed forces joined NATO allies

610
01:01:42,053 --> 01:01:46,591 
air strikes against Serbian forces responsible for the brutality in Kosovo.

611
01:01:46,691 --> 01:01:53,391 
24th March 1999, on the order of Javier Solana, the pure act of aggression,

612
01:01:53,564 --> 01:02:00,038 
NATO has violated the international law and UN Charter by attacking Yugoslavia from the air.

613
01:02:00,138 --> 01:02:03,808 
The people of Yugoslavia are, however, decided to show their true spirit

614
01:02:03,908 --> 01:02:12,908 
So what came out, sang songs and had fun bridges despite the disaster around them.

615
01:02:41,112 --> 01:02:45,183 
We thought that the Serbs will endure five days under the bombs and then give up.

616
01:02:45,283 --> 01:02:48,086 
No one ever expected that they would run around the bridges

617
01:02:48,186 --> 01:02:50,455 
to wear shirts with a target sign on his chest ...

618
01:02:50,555 --> 01:02:54,392 
The mission's aim was apparently to stop the violence in Kosovo and overthrow Slobo from power.

619
01:02:54,492 --> 01:02:57,228 
The bombing of Yugoslavia caused the opposite effect

620
01:02:57,328 --> 01:03:01,532 
since the conflict flared up in Kosovo, and Serb public opinion is concerned with Slobo.

621
01:03:01,632 --> 01:03:10,438 
reality of war was terrible. Schools, hospitals, bridges, television stations,

622
01:03:10,775 --> 01:03:15,646 
and even foreign embassies were legitimate targets of NATO.

623
01:03:15,746 --> 01:03:18,950 
The objectives that they were bombed, for example, the system power supply

624
01:03:19,050 --> 01:03:22,954 
Every night as an electrical station gadai so that could not pump water

625
01:03:23,054 --> 01:03:26,858 
bakery could not work in Belgrade. So, every day millions of people

626
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:33,231 
denied food and water. How did that affect the operation of the Serbian forces in Kosovo?

627
01:03:33,331 --> 01:03:35,633 
These were attacks on the Serbian people.

628
01:03:35,733 --> 01:03:41,906 
When the civilian population was killed, they call it collateral damage.

629
01:03:42,006 --> 01:03:46,210 
That's why you feel bad, because they are people ...

630
01:03:46,310 --> 01:03:49,480 
they have names and they are all for their families.

631
01:03:49,580 --> 01:03:52,817 
But for the rest of the world they are just collateral damage.

632
01:03:52,917 --> 01:04:00,124 
trying to kill the tobacco factory in Nis three. And it was eventually bought by Philip Morris.

633
01:04:00,224 --> 01:04:03,795 
Well, if I walk into a shop with a hammer and start hitting the shelves

634
01:04:03,895 --> 01:04:09,600
and after I say - you Platicu sicu in ruins, I then viking and vandal.

635
01:04:09,700 --> 01:04:11,969 
It seems that cigarettes are not produced in

636
01:04:12,069 --> 01:04:15,573 
also killed Albanians in Kosovo and had to be stopped.

637
01:04:15,673 --> 01:04:19,477 
It is obvious that the flip Morris had something against the factory in Nis

638
01:04:19,577 --> 01:04:22,713 
as they were Morisov main competitor in the European market.

639
01:04:22,813 --> 01:04:25,683 
The main cause of war was the desire to colonize the country economically.

640
01:04:25,783 --> 01:04:29,954 
To replace the entire incompatible domestic infrastructure, economic systems

641
01:04:30,054 --> 01:04:36,926 
compatible with American and German. That is why they bombed

642
01:04:37,395 --> 01:04:41,933 
Yugo car factory, which has managed to come to the U.S. market.

643
01:04:42,033 --> 01:04:44,335 
'YUGO - Your way to common sense'.

644
01:04:44,435 --> 01:04:49,373 
These are completely destroyed. Bombed a cement factory, oil industry

645
01:04:49,473 --> 01:04:54,846 
all telecommunications systems, in order to sell new, more expensive, but not better.

646
01:04:54,946 --> 01:04:59,250 
If this is the intention of NATO, it must be well coordinated from the beginning.

647
01:04:59,350 --> 01:05:04,121 
Indeed, nearly a year before the war, the World Bank is carefully analyzed

648
01:05:04,221 --> 01:05:08,960 
the possible consequences of military intervention and occupation of Kosovo

649
01:05:09,060 --> 01:05:14,131 
and conduct simulations that are 'envisaged the possibility of a state of emergency that erupted

650
01:05:14,231 --> 01:05:18,269 
because of tensions in Kosovo. " This suggests that NATO already contacted the World Bank

651
01:05:18,369 --> 01:05:22,139 
in the early stages of military planning. The plans for the occupation began

652
01:05:22,239 --> 01:05:26,110 
before he was found a good enough reason to intervene.

653
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:29,043 
But, wait a minute. Occupation?

654
01:05:29,413 --> 01:05:34,318 
Do not tell us that Kosovo should be freed from Serbian aggressors who are attacked Kosovo?

655
01:05:34,418 --> 01:05:38,289 
I still nobody objasio How can the state to attack itself.

656
01:05:38,389 --> 01:05:43,494 
History is distorted to the west created a pretext for intervention.

657
01:05:43,594 --> 01:05:48,799 
After five centuries of Ottoman rule, Kosovo is legally part of Serbia became the 1912th

658
01:05:48,899 --> 01:05:53,671 
Until then, many Serbs have already moved out, and those who remained were subjected to

659
01:05:53,771 --> 01:05:57,408 
new attacks during the second World War II, when Kosovo Albanian fascists occupied.

660
01:05:57,508 --> 01:06:03,381 
Mustafa Kruja, Prime Minister of Albania in Kosovo was the 1942nd and at a meeting of

661
01:06:03,481 --> 01:06:08,486 
with the Albanian leaders of Kosovo, he said: "We should ensure that the Serbian population of

662
01:06:08,586 --> 01:06:13,991 
in Kosovo be cleaned away and the Serbs who lived here centuries

663
01:06:14,091 --> 01:06:18,362 
colonizers and are declared to be sent to concentration camps in Albania.

664
01:06:18,462 --> 01:06:21,299 
Serbian settlers should be killed.

665
01:06:21,399 --> 01:06:27,371 
The terror of the indigenous Serbian population was a massive

666
01:06:27,471 --> 01:06:32,841 
with over 10,000 killed, 20,000 expelled.

667
01:06:40,451 --> 01:06:46,751 
This is the Tito Enver Hoxha, Albanian Communist dictator.

668
01:06:51,362 --> 01:06:55,299 
One thing not mentioned in connection with Tito is that he just did not want to rule

669
01:06:55,399 --> 01:06:59,103 
Yugoslavia, but he wanted most of the Balkan federation that would include

670
01:06:59,203 --> 01:07:06,043 
and Italje Greece, Bulgaria and Albania. This meant that the dictator Hoxha should see

671
01:07:06,143 --> 01:07:11,482 
welcome to the Albanians in Yugoslavia. Thus the Yugoslav Albanians

672
01:07:11,582 --> 01:07:16,420 
who lived mostly in Kosovo, get a better standard of living than in Albania!

673
01:07:16,520 --> 01:07:22,392 
They had their own universities, their schools, newspapers, political institutions, cultural centers

674
01:07:22,492 --> 01:07:31,392 
all the Albanian language. Albanians from Kosovo have flooded Albania and the Serbs were expelled.

675
01:07:42,379 --> 01:07:46,350 
The Western media have not mentioned anything of this. The official story was that Albanians from Kosovo

676
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:50,387 
want independence for Slobinih actions during the 1990s, which ignored the fact

677
01:07:50,487 --> 01:07:53,357 
that the Albanians are demanding republic status for Kosovo,

678
01:07:53,457 --> 01:07:58,028 
shortly after Tito's Yugoslavia was formed, at a time when Sloba born

679
01:07:58,128 --> 01:08:02,228 
a and held a mass demonstarcije 1968th

680
01:08:02,766 --> 01:08:06,703 
1974th years, Tito gave Kosovo, which is still a Serbian province

681
01:08:06,803 --> 01:08:11,441 
all the hallmarks of the republic, which is basically helping the Albanian leaders to continue their

682
01:08:11,541 --> 01:08:13,677 
what was begun during the second World War II.

683
01:08:13,777 --> 01:08:17,414 
There were many low-level intimidation. There were attacks on individuals

684
01:08:17,514 --> 01:08:21,485 
that police had not investigated properly.

685
01:08:21,585 --> 01:08:26,585 
In fact in general there were no arrests for such things.

686
01:08:27,524 --> 01:08:32,329 
New York Times on 12 July 1982nd, many years before he came to power Sloba,

687
01:08:32,429 --> 01:08:38,669 
as he wrote, 'the exodus of Serbs in Kosovo is one of the biggest problems that face the authorities. "

688
01:08:38,769 --> 01:08:41,872 
As for the Albanians who want to secede from Yugoslavia,

689
01:08:41,972 --> 01:08:46,009 
Becir Hoti, executive secretary of the Communist Party of Kosovo, said

690
01:08:46,109 --> 01:08:49,880 
that 'nationalists have a platform of two objectives - firstly to provide

691
01:08:49,980 --> 01:08:52,649 
what they call an ethnically clean Albanian republic

692
01:08:52,749 --> 01:08:56,853 
and then to unite with Albania to form a Greater Albania.

693
01:08:56,953 --> 01:09:00,557 
I desperately wanted help. They needed at all costs.

694
01:09:00,657 --> 01:09:02,757 
tapes at all costs?

695
01:09:07,431 --> 01:09:11,301 
Madeleine (Albright) I love you! I will never forget!

696
01:09:11,401 --> 01:09:16,373 
Madeleine, I adore, now and forever!

697
01:09:16,373 --> 01:09:21,373 
My dreams came true because I have your name.

698
01:09:21,378 --> 01:09:27,283 
When I grow up, I will do the same for children!

699
01:09:27,784 --> 01:09:32,584 
There are many girls in Kosovo whose name is Madeleine.

700
01:09:40,497 --> 01:09:43,567 
If you prefer, we can talk here, and we can go outside.

701
01:09:43,667 --> 01:09:46,659 
American peace delegation

702
01:09:46,770 --> 01:09:49,102 
703 KLA militants 01:09:51,274 --> 01:09:58,374 Mr. Clark, This is your group, all of them from the KLA, the former fighters.

704
01:10:02,419 --> 01:10:09,019 
Thank you for an incredibly large amount of money you've collected tonight.

705
01:10:11,294 --> 01:10:20,293 
I have to say ... I did not expect that someone will make such a big statue of me.

706
01:10:29,346 --> 01:10:33,684 
You have to admit, the Albanians really know how to be flattering to Americans.

707
01:10:33,784 --> 01:10:37,988 
The problem is that the Albanians did not know what she was getting into.

708
01:10:38,088 --> 01:10:43,994 
1998th, OVKje the State Department was designated as a 'terrorist organization

709
01:10:44,094 --> 01:10:49,394 
financed by heroin trafficking, and Osama bin Laden. '

710
01:10:49,433 --> 01:10:52,769 
How was it apparent that the KLA managed events in Kosovo,

711
01:10:52,869 --> 01:10:55,939 
The United States realized that they could use them for their own interests.

712
01:10:56,039 --> 01:11:01,578 
The entire northern part of Albania was controlled by the KLA, not the Albanian government.

713
01:11:01,678 --> 01:11:08,185 
American cargo planes twice a day brought the necessary equipment and weapons.

714
01:11:08,285 --> 01:11:13,457 
British special forces, CIA, U.S. army, ensured the training of the KLA

715
01:11:13,557 --> 01:11:22,566 
that was before the war. Germany was sending arms from Albania, the former East Germany

716
01:11:22,566 --> 01:11:26,002 
with the agreement that will give Albania the KLA.

717
01:11:26,102 --> 01:11:31,041 
The aim was to provoke a sharp reaction of the Serbian army, ostensibly to jump west

718
01:11:31,141 --> 01:11:40,341 
to stop the war and impose its policy. Sloba by the army and the conflict is the 1998th year.

719
01:12:02,572 --> 01:12:05,442 
Of course, all that is done the American army in Afghanistan and Iraq,

720
01:12:05,542 --> 01:12:09,780 
is much worse than what the Serbian army ever done in Kosovo.

721
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:14,384 
If you want to colonize the territory, which is not to write it in black and white?

722
01:12:14,484 --> 01:12:18,522 
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright was invented so-called Rambouillet Agreement

723
01:12:18,622 --> 01:12:22,526 
which was designed based on the model of the Dayton Agreement in Bosnia. NATO has mapped out here

724
01:12:22,626 --> 01:12:28,565 
how they occupy and colonize Yugoslavia at Rambouillet Accords Annex B:

725
01:12:28,665 --> 01:12:32,536 
NATO personnel shall with their vehicles, trucks, planes and other equipment

726
01:12:32,636 --> 01:12:40,436 
have free and unrestricted passage and free access to the whole of Yugoslavia.

727
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:48,785 
We have deliberately raised the bar too high, we knew that they can not private.

728
01:12:48,885 --> 01:12:55,154 
The aim of the annex of the agreement was to allow us the bomb.

729
01:12:55,625 --> 01:13:01,431 
In fact, it was a secret annex. Yes, that is, was not released to the public

730
01:13:01,531 --> 01:13:04,501 
until several months after the bombing. This document is

731
01:13:04,601 --> 01:13:10,440 
it also went a step further and actually promised secession of Kosovo for three years.

732
01:13:10,540 --> 01:13:15,812 
Kosovo's leaders signed an agreement last week. Although it does not give them everything they want.

733
01:13:15,912 --> 01:13:19,049 
- No, they should wait even three years.

734
01:13:19,149 --> 01:13:24,821 
- They found that a just peace is better than war with no victory.

735
01:13:24,921 --> 01:13:28,425 
On the other hand, Serbian leaders have rejected any talk

736
01:13:28,525 --> 01:13:31,628 
on the key elements of the peace agreement.

737
01:13:31,728 --> 01:13:35,632 
Hmm, I wonder why. "Hey, right 'ocete that you occupy in this or that way?"

738
01:13:35,732 --> 01:13:38,768 
Of course, while the true details were hidden, the story spread to

739
01:13:38,868 --> 01:13:41,605 
that Americans want to protect the Albanians.

740
01:13:41,705 --> 01:13:45,041 
to show some pictures of refugees, you know what, my heart is torn

741
01:13:45,141 --> 01:13:50,347 
America react to this terror, and images look, all these crimes.

742
01:13:50,447 --> 01:13:57,487 
Look at all this suffering, misery and madness. There is insidious evil that permeates this country.

743
01:13:57,587 --> 01:14:00,787 
Many Albanians did not dwell on this.

744
01:14:36,660 --> 01:14:44,634 
I believe that the intervention of the West 1999th against Serbia was possible because

745
01:14:44,634 --> 01:14:51,334 
geostrategic interests that had Western countries, especially the United States.

746
01:14:51,741 --> 01:14:53,343 
None of this had nothing to do with Albanians,

747
01:14:53,443 --> 01:14:58,943 
or the 'worried' Americans who want to protect them.

748
01:15:11,327 --> 01:15:15,665 
That's right, NATO and Albanians killed. Lots of them.

749
01:15:15,765 --> 01:15:20,670 
If they were concerned about the Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo, the West would not have helped the KLA

750
01:15:20,770 --> 01:15:24,507 
that is directly associated with organized crime and drug trafficking.

751
01:15:24,607 --> 01:15:26,943 
I do not help anyone when podrzavate Mafia.

752
01:15:27,043 --> 01:15:31,581 
After the great publicity about the incident in Racak, which was later Finnish forensic

753
01:15:31,681 --> 01:15:33,750 
Helena Ranta, proved to be false staged, NATO bombed

754
01:15:33,850 --> 01:15:37,621 
Yugoslavia, but failed to destroy the Yugoslav military.

755
01:15:37,721 --> 01:15:40,690 
By the end of NATO bombing, only 13 Yugoslav tanks were destroyed,

756
01:15:40,790 --> 01:15:45,128 
and most of them were old models that are intentionally left as bait.

757
01:15:45,228 --> 01:15:50,066 
Serbs had ingenious methods for protection of their defense forces.

758
01:15:50,166 --> 01:15:54,204 
They made wooden tanks, painted them to look like a real

759
01:15:54,304 --> 01:15:57,874 
and put the old heater or a microwave oven inside and involving it.

760
01:15:57,974 --> 01:16:02,445 
NATO comes with its sophisticated technology, see the goal and gadja it.

761
01:16:02,545 --> 01:16:05,548 
OK, these bombs costing several hundred thousand dollars apiece

762
01:16:05,648 --> 01:16:09,607 
a cardboard tank costs about $ 200.

763
01:16:40,683 --> 01:16:44,020 
So why Sloba gave NATO?

764
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:52,320 
2nd June 1999. Milosevic met with Martti Ahtisaari and Viktor Chernomyrdin.

765
01:16:53,096 --> 01:16:58,134 
Ahtisaari has read the conditions of NATO, Milosevic asked

766
01:16:58,234 --> 01:17:01,304 
'What happens if you do not sign up? "

767
01:17:01,404 --> 01:17:08,578 
Between them was a table with a vase of flowers, vase Ahtisaari was moved aside and said,

768
01:17:08,678 --> 01:17:14,551 
"Belgrade will be as this table. " Then he repeated the withdrawal of the hand across the table.

769
01:17:14,651 --> 01:17:19,222 
He said that for several weeks was half a million dead.

770
01:17:19,322 --> 01:17:22,692 
It would be completely to destroy Belgrade.

771
01:17:22,792 --> 01:17:26,463 
Faced with a monstrous threat Ahtisaari, had no choice Sloba

772
01:17:26,563 --> 01:17:34,763 
and signed the agreement, while Ahtisaari won the Nobel Prize Peace 2008th year.

773
01:17:37,907 --> 01:17:44,813 
These are the CBS news special, a part of our reporting on the crisis in Kosovo.

774
01:17:45,481 --> 01:17:48,451 
Today during the day, Serbian forces began withdrawing from Kosovo,

775
01:17:48,551 --> 01:17:52,622 
a NATO bombing campaign ended its jedanaestonedeljno.

776
01:17:52,722 --> 01:17:58,695 
Step Western geostrategic interests is filled with the 1999th

777
01:17:58,695 --> 01:18:03,466 
with the entry of NATO troops in Kosovo and they are still in Kosovo.

778
01:18:03,566 --> 01:18:06,469 
Along with the American troops have established a base Bondsteel

779
01:18:06,569 --> 01:18:09,806 
the second largest U.S. military base outside Germany 780 1:18:09.906 --> 01:18:13,843 army of lawyers and consultants was sent to Kosovo novookuprano

781
01:18:13,943 --> 01:18:18,982 
under the auspices of the World Bank to establish favorable conditions for foreign capital.

782
01:18:19,082 --> 01:18:20,683 
And how is it done?

783
01:18:20,783 --> 01:18:25,421 
They founded an organization to manage the privatization of companies

784
01:18:25,521 --> 01:18:30,326 
that were socially owned, and after a given period are decided

785
01:18:30,426 --> 01:18:39,502 
that do not pay attention to the legal ownership, not to see who is the owner, and that in fact

786
01:18:39,502 --> 01:18:44,274 
all confiscated and privatized, ie. sell to whomever they want.

787
01:18:44,374 --> 01:18:49,512 
Yugoslav banks in Kosovo is closed and the German mark is used as a currency.

788
01:18:49,612 --> 01:18:54,517 
Almost the entire banking system in Kosovo and handed over to the German Commerzbank AG

789
01:18:54,617 --> 01:18:59,289 
which has received full control of the commercial banking system in the province .

790
01:18:59,389 --> 01:19:02,158 
Wait a minute. Think about this a bit.

791
01:19:02,258 --> 01:19:05,662 
The violation of human rights. War crimes.

792
01:19:05,762 --> 01:19:07,797 
These were the reasons why the West went to Kosovo

793
01:19:07,897 --> 01:19:10,600 
so we were told in the media, right?

794
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:13,636 
Why, then head of UN mission in Kosovo was so obsessed with

795
01:19:13,736 --> 01:19:17,136 
taking coal from the Serbs?

796
01:19:18,741 --> 01:19:25,515 
Before the bombing, investors from the west have already set their eyes on the huge mines in Trepca

797
01:19:25,615 --> 01:19:32,655 
who is described as' the most valuable real estate in the Balkans, worth at least 5 billion. "

798
01:19:32,755 --> 01:19:36,526 
Trepca complex not only had vast reserves of copper and zinc

799
01:19:36,626 --> 01:19:39,128 
but also cadmium, gold and silver

800
01:19:39,228 --> 01:19:42,999 
The International Crisis Group, a set of experts, supported by George Soros

801
01:19:43,099 --> 01:19:47,871 
has published work: 'Trepca: making sense of the maze' in which UNMIK are

802
01:19:47,971 --> 01:19:51,908 
to 'seize Trepca as soon as the Serbs'

803
01:19:51,908 --> 01:19:55,678 
and that "Kosovars do not talk Trepca out of the question. "

804
01:19:55,778 --> 01:20:00,650 
And in August 2000., UNMIK chief Bernard Kouchner sent a heavily armed 'peacekeepers'

805
01:20:00,750 --> 01:20:05,154 
who wore masks against toxic gases, to occupy the mine.

806
01:20:05,254 --> 01:20:10,493 
This was done under the pretext that there was a threat to the mine pollutes the air.

807
01:20:10,593 --> 01:20:15,598 
Of course, a healthy environment has always been a priority for the West in Yugoslavia

808
01:20:15,698 --> 01:20:19,769 
even during bombardovaja he called the 'Angel of Mercy '.

809
01:20:19,869 --> 01:20:22,705 
After the NATO used depleted uranium weapons with

810
01:20:22,805 --> 01:20:25,675 
during the 1999 bombing., Military experts from Belgrade

811
01:20:25,775 --> 01:20:30,013 
measured the increase in radioactivity and claim that the area is very polluted.

812
01:20:30,113 --> 01:20:33,249 
Dr. Sedlak was he who first alerted the public

813
01:20:33,349 --> 01:20:39,322 
There is not one of the world where so many young people die from cancer.

814
01:20:39,422 --> 01:20:44,661 
In the veterinary station in southern Serbia, there is evidence that something was wrong.

815
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:47,797 
How uranium to be billions of years to break down

816
01:20:47,897 --> 01:20:53,603 
spirit of merciful angels will hover over this space virtually forever.

817
01:20:53,703 --> 01:20:55,104 
See, that's just fine.

818
01:20:55,204 --> 01:21:00,109 
In the meantime, the UN handed over the management of complex Trepca celkupnim

819
01:21:00,209 --> 01:21:06,516 
Western consortium. Morrison Knudsen had taken part in this agreement.

820
01:21:06,616 --> 01:21:10,653 
The new conglomerate was the Washington Group, one of the most powerful

821
01:21:10,753 --> 01:21:16,759 
engineering and construction companies, which is a leading performer in the defense USA.

822
01:21:16,859 --> 01:21:20,630 
Are any politician, businessman and lobbyist with the Western suit before the court

823
01:21:20,730 --> 01:21:25,635 
for the theft of the Yugoslav peoples, for the crimes against people from the former Yugoslavia?

824
01:21:25,735 --> 01:21:28,761 
No, no.

825
01:21:29,505 --> 01:21:35,178 
Instead, to avoid prosecution, they formed a tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands,

826
01:21:35,278 --> 01:21:38,648 
to judge people from former Yugoslavia to participate in the war.

827
01:21:38,748 --> 01:21:46,589 
The Hague Tribunal was established in 1993. on the basis of UN Security Council Resolution

828
01:21:46,689 --> 01:21:50,727 
and not the UN General Assembly resolution, which means that it is ad hoc body

829
01:21:50,827 --> 01:21:56,032 
made based on political decisions, not legal systems.

830
01:21:56,132 --> 01:22:00,069 
When you create a colony, just close the dissidents.

831
01:22:00,169 --> 01:22:04,907 
In Belgrade, Sloba, who was declared man of peace 1995th The

832
01:22:05,007 --> 01:22:07,977 
when he gave Bosnia the west, since it was a heady

833
01:22:08,077 --> 01:22:12,582 
and did not want to do the same with Kosovo, accused for war crimes.

834
01:22:12,682 --> 01:22:17,620 
I think that every world leader knows that if you do not respect the system

835
01:22:17,720 --> 01:22:20,890 
It is very likely that they will be executed in one or another way.

836
01:22:20,990 --> 01:22:24,994 
After the huge anti-slobovske campaign financed from the pockets of western ...

837
01:22:25,094 --> 01:22:28,931 
The European Union and the United States has spent millions of euros in training and supplying

838
01:22:29,031 --> 01:22:34,504 
opposition parties in Yugoslavia led to a successful election campaign .

839
01:22:34,604 --> 01:22:39,409 
Sloba lost the 2000 elections. But refused to buckle under rival

840
01:22:39,509 --> 01:22:45,509 
Vojislav Kostunica. Ment has decided that now was a lot.

841
01:22:49,051 --> 01:22:56,751 
'Victory! Victory! " - Shouting crowd. 'Slobodan, save Serbia, kill yourself! " shout the other

842
01:23:01,197 --> 01:23:04,860 
Sloba fell. But what next?

843
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:10,540 
Politicians have continued to dispute over unimportant nonsense in the most popular

844
01:23:10,640 --> 01:23:16,140
reality show, called Parliament of the Republic of Serbia!

845
01:24:50,473 --> 01:24:56,279 
Instead of focusing on important things, they still allow the splitting of Yugoslavia.

846
01:24:56,379 --> 01:25:01,317 
2003rd, the name 'Jugoslavija'je officially ceased to exist

847
01:25:01,417 --> 01:25:06,117 
thanks to an ingenious recipe Javier Solana.

848
01:25:11,294 --> 01:25:16,566 
But one man did not want to surrender their country and its system just like that.

849
01:25:16,666 --> 01:25:22,572 
Blasko Gabric, from my home town of Subotica, he decided to make a radical step.

850
01:25:22,672 --> 01:25:26,642 
Yugoslavian socialism was far, far better than other socialisms

851
01:25:26,742 --> 01:25:31,581 
in comparison to, say, with the Russians or Chinese socialism. We had a paradise

852
01:25:31,681 --> 01:25:35,651 
If you can imagine a paradise on earth, it was Yugoslavia.

853
01:25:35,751 --> 01:25:38,955 
Blasko explains who is kidnapped by his piece of paradise.

854
01:25:39,055 --> 01:25:44,721 
Western world only story you will get to heaven when you die.

855
01:25:45,528 --> 01:25:48,831 
They will not be afforded to heaven while you're alive.

856
01:25:48,931 --> 01:25:54,870 
So he turned his 15 acres of land, a new, fourth Yugoslavia.

857
01:25:54,970 --> 01:25:57,907 
If they destroy your factory, if you make of all private property

858
01:25:58,007 --> 01:26:00,876 
all we had, we see no more, as is it called?

859
01:26:00,976 --> 01:26:03,813 
The West has said that it is democracy.

860
01:26:03,913 --> 01:26:11,115 
We have a very good joke about it. Muslims asked to explain hodza

861
01:26:11,921 --> 01:26:17,460 
what democracy is, to explain to them so that they can not understand the concept.

862
01:26:17,560 --> 01:26:24,166 
He says: 'I can very easily explained. You see, when I get to the top of minarets

863
01:26:24,266 --> 01:26:27,536 
and you're down below me and I letters in you ...

864
01:26:27,636 --> 01:26:30,640 
Can you also write to me. Now that's democracy.

865
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:32,675 
Okay, kidding aside

866
01:26:32,775 --> 01:26:36,012 
withdrawal of Yugoslav names is encouraged unhealthy pattern.

867
01:26:36,112 --> 01:26:40,950 
When they took the name of Yugoslavia, when we were called Serbia and Montenegro

868
01:26:41,050 --> 01:26:45,121 
West says Montenegro: Serbia Leave itself.

869
01:26:45,221 --> 01:26:48,824 
2006th , following a controversial referendum

870
01:26:48,924 --> 01:26:51,694 
Montenegro became the newest state of the world.

871
01:26:51,794 --> 01:26:59,462 
55.4% of citizens voted for independence of Montenegro.

872
01:26:59,935 --> 01:27:04,840 
However, another part of the former Yugoslavia, wished this status.

873
01:27:04,940 --> 01:27:07,140 
You guessed it - Kosovo.

874
01:27:07,143 --> 01:27:10,112 
That same year, negotiations began between the government in Belgrade,

875
01:27:10,212 --> 01:27:13,649 
and the status of the Albanian minority in Kosovo.

876
01:27:13,749 --> 01:27:17,420 
so-called negotiations, though, were a farce from the beginning

877
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:23,459 
jerje most of the Western powers already promised Kosovo independence regardless of negotiations.

878
01:27:23,559 --> 01:27:29,231 
Sooner or later you have to say, well, that's enough - Kosovo is independent

879
01:27:29,331 --> 01:27:35,237 
This is our position. Kosovo citizens must know that it is solid, unwavering position

880
01:27:35,337 --> 01:27:39,241 
even though there is diplomacy and negotiation, but if it is obvious that it will not happen

881
01:27:39,341 --> 01:27:46,441 
in a relatively short period of time, in my opinion, we need to make a decision.

882
01:27:47,216 --> 01:27:52,221 
Think about it. When you make the biggest world powers said they can get whatever you want

883
01:27:52,321 --> 01:27:55,157 
why would you, by God, meet with less than that

884
01:27:55,257 --> 01:27:57,760 
and tried to find a compromise?

885
01:27:57,860 --> 01:28:06,860 
According to forecasts, the negotiations failed and Kosovo unilaterally declared independence.

886
01:28:07,937 --> 01:28:14,844 
It was my honor to welcome the president and prime minister of an independent Kosovo in the White House.

887
01:28:14,944 --> 01:28:21,484 
I'm proud of you here, welcome. I strongly supports Kosovo independence.

888
01:28:21,584 --> 01:28:31,084 
protest Kosovo Albanians for independence

889
01:28:40,736 --> 01:28:44,573 
I am committed to the U.S. will continue to work with those states that

890
01:28:44,673 --> 01:28:49,578 
not recognized an independent Kosovo to convince them to do so as soon as possible.

891
01:28:49,678 --> 01:28:54,517 
Contrary to what is hoped bus, most of the world has not recognized Kosovo,

892
01:28:54,617 --> 01:28:59,955 
and it is not even become a member of the UN. Kosovo, therefore, failed to become states.

893
01:29:00,055 --> 01:29:03,659 
What is absurd about this story is that the Albanian minority

894
01:29:03,759 --> 01:29:09,498 
that doistinu suffered during the 1990s, believed that received independence in 2008.

895
01:29:09,598 --> 01:29:13,803 
This is a great day for the people of Kosovo, the Albanians.

896
01:29:13,903 --> 01:29:20,934 
- How do you feel? - Oh, I feel very good. This is like a dream.

897
01:29:22,177 --> 01:29:28,777 
As a Serb, I'm sorry Albanians. They are wrong even more than us.

898
01:29:29,151 --> 01:29:31,787 
They think they have an independent state!

899
01:29:31,887 --> 01:29:32,421 
They think they have an independent state!

900
01:29:32,521 --> 01:29:35,649 
Kosovo is an American military base.

901
01:29:36,425 --> 01:29:40,329 
just happens to have some local color called Albanians.

902
01:29:40,429 --> 01:29:43,364 
They're just leaves on the trees.

903
01:29:43,532 --> 01:29:47,402 
The Kosovo government and Kosovo's people will ever give away a token

904
01:29:47,502 --> 01:29:51,373 
deep respect for the United States and the American administration.

905
01:29:51,473 --> 01:29:54,209 
And, now, would they be able to decide something does not fit

906
01:29:54,309 --> 01:29:57,109 
in the U.S. wishes? No way.

907
01:29:57,112 --> 01:30:01,783 
Do you think that the Kosovo government can do is something the Americans do not agree?

908
01:30:01,883 --> 01:30:03,883 
Ne.

909
01:30:31,713 --> 01:30:33,048 
We listen to Americans.

910
01:30:33,148 --> 01:30:39,948 
America, it has 50 states. Why then Kosovo would not be part of America?

911
01:30:40,222 --> 01:30:45,794 
- You would support that? - Yes, why not. They already administer all in Kosovo.

912
01:30:45,894 --> 01:30:50,298 
The Americans are in control? That they more or less controlled all here.

913
01:30:50,398 --> 01:30:54,998 
We are not independent from the European Union and America.

914
01:30:56,805 --> 01:31:00,876 
The official channels through which the international community holds

915
01:31:00,976 --> 01:31:04,713 
absolute power over all aspects of political and economic life

916
01:31:04,813 --> 01:31:08,750 
in Kosovo presented through the International Civilian Representative who shall have the right

917
01:31:08,850 --> 01:31:11,720 
to dismiss any elected official, and to annul 918 01:31:11,820 - > 01:31:16,691 which has passed the Kosovo parliament. At the same time, there is an informal channel

919
01:31:16,791 --> 01:31:21,596 
through which the international community to interfere in politics and economy of Kosovo

920
01:31:21,696 --> 01:31:25,801 
by Ambassador powerful countries who have seen or have represented myself

921
01:31:25,901 --> 01:31:32,607 
as sponsors of Kosovo's independence. These greens are a kind of ambassador commandments

922
01:31:32,707 --> 01:31:37,712 
Kosovo politicians. Kosovo is still a colony and colonization of this

923
01:31:37,812 --> 01:31:44,650 
in fact worsened living standards in Kosovo.

924
01:31:45,353 --> 01:31:49,124 
A little further from Kosovo, the Serbian province of other citizens were not aware of

925
01:31:49,224 --> 01:31:53,395 
what was coming. Situated right in the middle of the Pannonian Plain

926
01:31:53,495 --> 01:31:56,465 
Vojvodina has always been an attractive piece of territory

927
01:31:56,565 --> 01:31:59,367 
exploited because of its fertile land.

928
01:31:59,867 --> 01:32:05,607 
After Kosovo's declaration of independence, the West turned to the north.

929
01:32:05,707 --> 01:32:11,412 
Before the end of 2009., In an article published in the Economist, the situation

930
01:32:11,512 --> 01:32:19,387 
in the northern Serbian province has been described as' very limit the independence of Vojvodina ".

931
01:32:19,487 --> 01:32:27,287 
After all, 'Kosovo and Vojvodina had the same kind of high autonomy. "

932
01:32:31,332 --> 01:32:34,302 
Could not I take something? Why all this silence?

933
01:32:34,402 --> 01:32:37,338 
You see, there is a way to force people to do things in Serbia,

934
01:32:37,438 --> 01:32:40,441 
or any other former Yugoslav Republic

935
01:32:40,541 --> 01:32:46,347 
just tell them that this is another step towards the European Union.

936
01:32:46,447 --> 01:32:50,351 
EU, a unique political and economic partnership of European countries,

937
01:32:50,451 --> 01:32:54,255 
which allows members the exchange of goods, people and ideas to market

938
01:32:54,355 --> 01:32:58,359 
that includes about a billion people. With the exception of the official definition of this

939
01:32:58,459 --> 01:33:02,564 
there's more to it which is not visible at first glance.

940
01:33:02,664 --> 01:33:07,364 
The European Union is a project of the elite class in Europe,

941
01:33:07,602 --> 01:33:13,202 
that ignores the core values ??of European civilization 942 01:33:13,508 - > 01:33:21,382 and seeks to replace them with politically correct ideology dictate postnacionalizma postmodernism.

943
01:33:21,482 --> 01:33:24,319 
First, your country needs to open their markets to European products,

944
01:33:24,419 --> 01:33:28,823 
and to sell all of his bank, which is equivalent to the lecture queen and guns in check.

945
01:33:28,923 --> 01:33:32,794 
Then, your domestic industry, agriculture and stock market declining

946
01:33:32,894 --> 01:33:37,465 
which allows foreign companies to obtain competitive prices for your most valuable trump card

947
01:33:37,565 --> 01:33:42,503 
If we continue the chess analogy, your government is playing against the EU as a beginner 948 01:33:42,603 ??-> 01:33:46,140 which is ten steps ahead of you. You may know how to move the figure

949
01:33:46,240 --> 01:33:51,312 
but your opponent knows how to get you on thin ice and gets what she wants. Checkmate.

950
01:33:51,412 --> 01:33:55,817 
In the Czech Republic, EU sugar industry was forced to close its factory

951
01:33:55,917 --> 01:34:01,489 
because the EU had too much sugar imported from Cuba that they made more profit.

952
01:34:01,589 --> 01:34:06,227 
Instead, the Czechs were given a small gift from Germany - their dirty industry

953
01:34:06,327 --> 01:34:09,330 
that they are no longer able to keep the them because of the Kyoto Protocol.

954
01:34:09,430 --> 01:34:13,368 
In Hungary, the vineyards were destroyed with the low prices of French wines

955
01:34:13,468 --> 01:34:17,271 
so that the Hungarians were unable to repay debts to banks and the party

956
01:34:17,371 --> 01:34:20,274 
bought their vineyards at low prices. As a result,

957
01:34:20,374 --> 01:34:25,813 
famous Hungarian Tokaj vineyards now owned by the English.

958
01:34:25,913 --> 01:34:30,713 
'No deal', says the man, 'just poverty. "

959
01:34:32,286 --> 01:34:36,758 
The situation has deteriorated since the end of the nearby Secerana Serenca

960
01:34:36,858 --> 01:34:41,896 
closed last year. 80 people from the village Mezozombora lost their jobs.

961
01:34:41,996 --> 01:34:44,021 
factory break down.

962
01:34:44,665 --> 01:34:46,868 
I think to notice pattern here.

963
01:34:46,968 --> 01:34:52,707 
places like the Balkans and the rest of Eastern Europe should not have been colleagues

964
01:34:52,807 --> 01:34:58,680 
and equal in the brotherhood of nations, but for them market is intended to be

965
01:34:58,780 --> 01:35:05,344 
for the western industrial goods, to be a source of cheap labor.

966
01:35:48,629 --> 01:35:53,729 
Keep in mind that it takes time to join the EU.

967
01:36:34,442 --> 01:36:37,378 
But you will not hear anything about these things in the media.

968
01:36:37,478 --> 01:36:46,580 
EU spends around two billion euros a year for his advertising in the media.

969
01:36:47,054 --> 01:36:53,127 
They spozorisu show programs on TV, radio, various other programs and so on.

970
01:36:53,227 --> 01:36:59,534 
They organize conferences, especially for journalists. It is a massive industry

971
01:36:59,634 --> 01:37:04,038 
You almost never hear criticism by EU journalists.

972
01:37:04,138 --> 01:37:07,074 
In Serbia has never been any real debate on the EU's

973
01:37:07,174 --> 01:37:11,012 
and even attempt to start such a debate would be sentenced

974
01:37:11,112 --> 01:37:14,512 
from the very beginning as an anti-European.

975
01:37:14,515 --> 01:37:20,515 
Those who attempt to begin such discussions are terminated.

976
01:38:16,610 --> 01:38:23,448 
I remember that man, was the party of neo G-17 +

977
01:38:23,784 --> 01:38:31,884 
He told me: 'Yes, you criticize the EU, and you live in the EU. Slovenia in the EU is good '.

978
01:38:31,926 --> 01:38:37,398 
No, I really do not. This is a standard propaganda, do you understand?

979
01:38:37,498 --> 01:38:42,398 
We are not better because we in the EU, but the other way around.

980
01:38:42,436 --> 01:38:48,943 
We are in the EU because we are better than others, eg., The former Yugoslav republics.

981
01:38:49,043 --> 01:38:54,949 
After the death of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav republics, each wanted to become a EU member.

982
01:38:55,049 --> 01:39:00,588 
Slovenia became the first who joined in 2004., But was not thrilled.

983
01:39:00,688 --> 01:39:08,595 
We have not more states, we are the only EU region. Why are you hard?

984
01:39:09,196 --> 01:39:14,936 
We do not have monetary policy, we practically have no fiscal policy

985
01:39:15,036 --> 01:39:19,598 
because we are limited by EU rules.

986
01:39:20,174 --> 01:39:23,044 
Are things better now that Slovenia is in EU?

987
01:39:23,144 --> 01:39:25,144 
No, I think not.

988
01:39:25,179 --> 01:39:26,914 
No, it seems to me that it is not.

989
01:39:27,014 --> 01:39:28,916 
I do not think so.

990
01:39:29,016 --> 01:39:34,113 
prices have doubled, everything is more expensive.

991
01:39:34,355 --> 01:39:36,655 
The clothing is more expensive.

992
01:39:36,657 --> 01:39:43,057 
I voted 'no' when we had a referendum on EU accession.

993
01:39:53,607 --> 01:40:00,706 
As you know, if you are part of the EU, you give something in common EU coffers.

994
01:40:01,415 --> 01:40:06,620 
A lot of social rights that we had earlier has now narrowed.

995
01:40:06,720 --> 01:40:10,691 
In my personal opinion, I believe that the EU is more corporations

996
01:40:10,791 --> 01:40:16,191 
than a political organization that provides human rights.

997
01:40:34,281 --> 01:40:38,119 
right across Slovenia, Croatia has dropped out of applying

998
01:40:38,219 --> 01:40:41,055 
Ecological and Fisheries Protection Zone (ZERP) to the EU countries

999
01:40:41,155 --> 01:40:44,992 
since the third Italian fishing activities were based in this area.

1000
01:40:45,092 --> 01:40:50,592 
Croatia is also thrown into the water its banking sector.

1001
01:41:03,277 --> 01:41:08,182 
On the other hand, citizens of Serbia hardly cease to believe in everything that comes from the west in

1002
01:41:08,282 --> 01:41:12,086 
often believing the propaganda to the west really like

1003
01:41:12,186 --> 01:41:17,258 
and that even if the Serbs were bombed, they do so for the good of the Serbs.

1004
01:41:17,358 --> 01:41:21,162 
I think it is a situation where we are today a result of

1005
01:41:21,262 --> 01:41:27,234 
something that I call predatory capitalism. He started in the 70's

1006
01:41:27,334 --> 01:41:30,271 
when I was an economic killer, and then we were using predatory capitalism

1007
01:41:30,371 --> 01:41:33,174 
in the developing world at large. The first principle of the

1008
01:41:33,274 --> 01:41:42,274 
that the only responsibility of business to maximize profits regardless of the consequences for society and the environment.

1009
01:42:01,202 --> 01:42:06,173 
After the breakup of Yugoslavia, the federal debt is divided between the successor states.

1010
01:42:06,273 --> 01:42:11,479 
2010th years, the prosperity that was promised to everyone, it is clearly expressed.

1011
01:42:11,579 --> 01:42:18,652 
In Montenegro, the debt was 416 million figure reached 4.7 billion dollars.

1012
01:42:18,752 --> 01:42:24,358 
Macedonia has jumped from 890 million to 6.7 billion dollars in debt in

1013
01:42:24,458 --> 01:42:29,463 
and Bosnia has gone from 2.1 billion to 16.5 billion dollars in debt.

1014
01:42:29,563 --> 01:42:34,802 
Long Serbia has risen from 5.5 billion to 38 billion dollars in

1015
01:42:34,902 --> 01:42:40,568 
Slovenia from 2.6 billion to a staggering 56 , 3 billion.

1016
01:42:41,141 --> 01:42:44,011 
And Croatia, the absolute winner of the 1017 debt nagomilanju 01:42:44,111 --> 01:42:49,811 with $ 4.6 billion to a staggering $ 69 billion.

1018
01:43:27,187 --> 01:43:30,057 
Eh, Yugoslavs like to say that they lived well during Tito's Yugoslavia in

1019
01:43:30,157 --> 01:43:34,457 
because they had been in charge. And now is not?

1020
01:44:02,790 --> 01:44:07,490 
OK, they were bought by foreigners. What's so bad?

1021
01:44:37,224 --> 01:44:42,162 
Here's an example to the west with Yugoslavia robbed minus debts.

1022
01:44:42,262 --> 01:44:45,562 
First, it imposed a severe sanction.

1023
01:45:11,358 --> 01:45:19,158 
Miroljub Labus, otherwise, a member of the G17 +, one of those so-called. pro-IMF experts.

1024
01:45:53,300 --> 01:45:58,839 
2008th years, Croatia has earned 9.3 billion dollars from tourism in

1025
01:45:58,939 --> 01:46:03,610 
which is about 29% of Croatia's total GDP. This would be great

1026
01:46:03,710 --> 01:46:06,810 
that the money and stayed in Croatia.

1027
01:46:13,620 --> 01:46:18,325 
9.3 billion, Croatia, the other small waiter's wages, payroll taxes in

1028
01:46:18,425 --> 01:46:25,432 
tax on goods and services from 19% euros and wishes of the restaurants, cafes and private accommodation

1029
01:46:25,532 --> 01:46:28,558 
and the profits went to Germany.

1030
01:46:28,969 --> 01:46:32,268 
Thank you Germany, my soul on fire.

1031
01:46:32,673 --> 01:46:35,509 
And if macroeconomic stability is threatened in all the republics in

1032
01:46:35,609 --> 01:46:37,811 
The IMF and World Bank come into play in order to 'save the situation' .

1033
01:46:37,911 --> 01:46:41,715 
And how do they do? Let's say you IMF and World Bank provide a loan in

1034
01:46:41,815 --> 01:46:45,919 
than 300 million dollars that pay interest of 5.5 to 7%.

1035
01:46:46,019 --> 01:46:49,790 
But money is not going anywhere, no no, it stays in the big American and German banks in

1036
01:46:49,890 --> 01:46:54,695 
and the Republican foreign exchange reserves , to which the payment of interest of 2 to 2.5%.

1037
01:46:54,795 --> 01:47:00,434 
Then, that same bank, in essence, with the Republican money, provide investment loans republics

1038
01:47:00,534 --> 01:47:04,471 
through the various development funds, which again increases the debt to be repaid in

1039
01:47:04,571 --> 01:47:09,471 
only with new borrowing. So it's all in a circle.

1040
01:47:17,417 --> 01:47:22,322 
What does it mean for ordinary people? If we look at statistics, so much each citizen in

1041
01:47:22,422 --> 01:47:25,793 
Yugoslavia owes international financiers. However, many people still think

1042
01:47:25,893 --> 01:47:29,793 
of the factors that come to help us.

1043
01:47:51,518 --> 01:47:54,521 
Foreign banks used the desperate state of the Yugoslav peoples in

1044
01:47:54,621 --> 01:47:59,521 
for personal interests, sometimes by criminal means.

1045
01:48:22,783 --> 01:48:26,487 
desperate situation has become worse due to the global financial crisis in

1046
01:48:26,587 --> 01:48:30,491 
and Croatia look into what else could sell, and that abound.

1047
01:48:30,591 --> 01:48:33,287 
That's right, the island!

1048
01:48:33,760 --> 01:48:37,965 
2009th, the British 'Independent'je announced that Croatia wants to sell

1049
01:48:38,065 --> 01:48:44,365 
Brijuni national park, where there is Tito's luxurious villa.

1050
01:49:02,289 --> 01:49:07,294 
In the meantime, the colony of Bosnia, the IMF said Section 7 a new Bosnian constitution in

1051
01:49:07,394 --> 01:49:11,298 
laid down in Dayton, Ohio. They decided the following:

1052
01:49:11,398 --> 01:49:18,338 
'Board of Directors of the Central Bank shall consist of a Governor will ask the IMF "1053 01:49:18,438 --> 01:49:25,178 and that' The Governor shall be a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina or any neighboring countries. "

1054
01:49:25,278 --> 01:49:29,383 
So, the government of Bosnia has no control over their own economy.

1055
01:49:29,483 --> 01:49:34,354
It would not be fair to say that all the money invested in Bosnia Otplacivanje used for its debts.

1056
01:49:34,454 --> 01:49:38,054 
No, a lot of money is gone and the Bosnians.

1057
01:49:38,425 --> 01:49:43,864 
The only thing that could have gone into the hands of a very small number of Bosnians. Very, very few.

1058
01:49:43,964 --> 01:49:47,034 
According to the Unit for Combating Corruption, which established the Office

1059
01:49:47,134 --> 01:49:52,506 
High Representative, a billion dollars has disappeared from public funds and international

1060
01:49:52,606 --> 01:49:55,876 
charitable projects for assistance, between the 1995th and 1999. year.

1061
01:49:55,976 --> 01:50:00,814 
Wondering where all that money go? For example, in the town of Sanski Most in

1062
01:50:00,914 --> 01:50:06,720 
money went to the track for horse racing, rather than economic development or infrastructure.

1063
01:50:06,820 --> 01:50:09,890 
If you're going to steal public funds and aid, which does not go one step further in

1064
01:50:09,990 --> 01:50:15,796 
and gambles them, right? Mayor of Sanski Most also gave 450 000 1065 01:50:15,896 --> 01:50:21,101 from his brother, Saudi Arabia, that guy has opened a new bank.

1066
01:50:21,201 --> 01:50:25,801 
against him is invested 358 charges of corruption.

1067
01:50:26,206 --> 01:50:29,242 
Next, Montenegro relied on smuggling of cigarettes in the state in

1068
01:50:29,342 --> 01:50:32,479 
would not have sunk during the war years.

1069
01:50:32,579 --> 01:50:37,751 
Its leaders, Djukanovic and Bulatovic, claiming to have never personally profited from the smuggling.

1070
01:50:37,851 --> 01:50:41,755 
And that's really strange, given that Prime Minister Djukanovic was the 20th the list of

1071
01:50:41,855 --> 01:50:46,660 
the world's richest president in the 2010th, that is three times richer than Nicolas Sarkozy's

1072
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:49,060 
and Barack Obama together.

1073
01:50:49,596 --> 01:50:56,570 
Milo Djukanovic has been more successful than others in converting the entire country in a private feud

1074
01:50:56,670 --> 01:51:03,377 
governed by the principles of Cosa Nostra. In fact, I think that his personal wealth in

1075
01:51:03,477 --> 01:51:09,383 
a lot more than is officially announced, and that he can say free

1076
01:51:09,483 --> 01:51:11,818 
to own everything that exists in Montenegro.

1077
01:51:11,918 --> 01:51:16,556 
Because of this elite did not care for other people at the bottom of the food chain in

1078
01:51:16,656 --> 01:51:20,856 
had to resort to measures hopeless.

1079
01:51:35,542 --> 01:51:42,642 
Samir (44) was born in Bosnia and convinced that beneath these layers of soil in

1080
01:51:43,350 --> 01:51:46,550 
is the largest pyramid in the world .

1081
01:51:46,653 --> 01:51:49,189 
Many young people have realized what was happening and began to struggle in

1082
01:51:49,289 --> 01:51:52,092 
against him in what their country is being transformed .

1083
01:51:52,192 --> 01:51:54,261 
The name of our group Beogradski Sindikat

1084
01:51:54,361 --> 01:51:58,665 
which would be translated into English as Belgrade Union.

1085
01:51:58,765 --> 01:52:02,069 
Union Belgrade, the Serbian rap group, famous for the critical interpretation of

1086
01:52:02,169 --> 01:52:07,169 
reality, the social elite and the criminal element.

1087
01:52:16,883 --> 01:52:19,786 
Bosko Cirkovic from Belgrade in 1088 explains why the Union 01:52:19,886 --> 01:52:22,989 Few people take something concrete against injustice.

1089
01:52:23,089 --> 01:52:30,497 
A lot of young people in Serbia, and young people in the world, thinking only of material things

1090
01:52:30,597 --> 01:52:38,997 
and you know, when you go to politics go there to be seized to even more material things.

1091
01:52:42,876 --> 01:52:47,414 
When I was in the same room with the characters who run this country in

1092
01:52:47,514 --> 01:52:51,718 
and one of my main characters is a former professor of psychology in high school in

1093
01:52:51,818 --> 01:52:55,918 
I would have carried out a revolution against them.

1094
01:53:06,433 --> 01:53:14,433 
To this ends, I do not know, but some of us would not have left the room.

1095
01:53:23,717 --> 01:53:28,617 
Down in Sarajevo, things were much different.

1096
01:54:13,733 --> 01:54:18,939 
Dubioza Kolektiv the Sarajevo group with a similar message as the one in Belgrade.

1097
01:54:19,039 --> 01:54:25,745 
As long as people think that their impact on the democratic process ends

1098
01:54:25,845 --> 01:54:31,718 
you put the ballot into the box, nothing will change, because the

1099
01:54:31,818 --> 01:54:39,218 
It gives those who are elected for 4 years, feel free to do what they want.

1100
01:54:50,103 --> 01:54:58,067 
The ruling elite do not listen to anyone. This is the best thing they have learned.

1101
01:54:59,913 --> 01:55:03,246 
They even ignore mass protests.

1102
01:55:20,200 --> 01:55:26,006 
Unfortunately, the elites in power, even if the majority against them, still do not listen.

1103
01:55:26,106 --> 01:55:33,239 
One of my very close friend was at a private dinner in

1104
01:55:33,947 --> 01:55:39,052 
where the present U.S. Ambassador to Serbia, Cameroon Munter.

1105
01:55:39,152 --> 01:55:44,090 
The dinner is held after the elections in which the Serbian Radical Party in

1106
01:55:44,190 --> 01:55:49,562 
which is much more oriented towards the independence of the Democratic Party

1107
01:55:49,662 --> 01:55:58,538 
got the most votes and won. And we all thought that, because the voters voted in

1108
01:55:58,638 --> 01:56:03,843 
the largest party to form a government. My friend asked Kamorun Munter:

1109
01:56:03,943 --> 01:56:10,543 
'Well, Mr. Munter, it seems that your mission has failed! "

1110
01:56:10,717 --> 01:56:18,749 
Mission to Serbia brought under imperialist patronage. He answered:

1111
01:56:19,559 --> 01:56:25,498 
'I would not be so hasty. If I were on your place, I watched TV tomorrow

1112
01:56:25,598 --> 01:56:31,598 
to see what the results of talks between Tadic and Dacic.

1113
01:56:41,281 --> 01:56:47,554 
And, while the government formed a Washington, policies and laws are also dictated from outside.

1114
01:56:47,654 --> 01:56:51,057 
American Chamber of Commerce writes laws for the government of Serbia

1115
01:56:51,157 --> 01:56:54,427 
and finding them that these laws must be passed.

1116
01:56:54,527 --> 01:56:59,065 
So the countries of former Yugoslavia started to become members of NATO.

1117
01:56:59,165 --> 01:57:04,104 
Do you know what it means to join NATO? You have to get rid of the entire military arsenal in

1118
01:57:04,204 --> 01:57:09,075 
domestic production, domestic design and development, intended for you to pitch in

1119
01:57:09,175 --> 01:57:18,275 
armed themselves to American aircraft F16, F18, F22, hundreds of thousands of dollars per aircraft.

1120
01:57:19,152 --> 01:57:23,757 
And your sons and daughters have to go to fight. Where they want to fight?

1121
01:57:23,857 --> 01:57:27,727 
They want to put night vision goggles and go to Afghanistan in

1122
01:57:27,827 --> 01:57:32,632 
where we will kill their enemies that we are not takle.

1123
01:57:32,732 --> 01:57:37,470 
Profits and military gains were re-acquired from these economic and geopolitical colonies.

1124
01:57:37,570 --> 01:57:41,274 
The people were completely unaware of what is happening to them in

1125
01:57:41,374 --> 01:57:44,744 
i thought they were finally free and independent.

1126
01:57:44,844 --> 01:57:50,150 
What happened in Yugoslavia can be regarded as a classic example of colonization.

1127
01:57:50,250 --> 01:57:54,554 
Doduse with a new flavor, but it is still colonization.

1128
01:57:54,654 --> 01:57:59,692 
Instead of colonizing the uninhabited parts of the world, why not make a mess somewhere

1129
01:57:59,792 --> 01:58:07,734 
and then you fix it? That part of the world that have already been developed and where there are consumers.

1130
01:58:07,834 --> 01:58:11,571 
They wanted Yugoslavia, whose rich natural resources will be

1131
01:58:11,671 --> 01:58:15,575 
be available to multinational corporations, whose population in 1132 01:58:15.675 --> 01:58:19,679 to work for low wages, whose economies will compete in

1133
01:58:19,779 --> 01:58:25,652 
existing producers, only new investment opportunities. They wanted Yugoslavia

1134
01:58:25,752 --> 01:58:31,524 
whose oil would, engineering, mining and automobile industries were dismantled in

1135
01:58:31,624 --> 01:58:36,596 
and deindustrijalizovana and they wanted to destroy the Yugoslav public sector in

1136
01:58:36,696 --> 01:58:39,099 
his services and social programs.

1137
01:58:39,199 --> 01:58:41,301 
I. .. they did it.

1138
01:58:41,401 --> 01:58:46,840 
What's more, the peace that the peoples of Yugoslavia to build their own good is destroyed.

1139
01:58:46,940 --> 01:58:52,112 
The claim that the hatred between the peoples of Yugoslavia, there was always just a stereotype.

1140
01:58:52,212 --> 01:58:55,215 
South Slavs were traveling together from the north to come to this area in

1141
01:58:55,315 --> 01:58:58,118 
and found their own piece of paradise around the 6th century.

1142
01:58:58,218 --> 01:59:02,255 
hate are later fabricated a great power, who wanted to learn Slovene

1143
01:59:02,355 --> 01:59:07,227 
how to be civilized and democratic. Please note that for most of the 20th Century

1144
01:59:07,327 --> 01:59:11,331 
Blacks were not allowed to sit in the front seats on buses in the U.S. in

1145
01:59:11,431 --> 01:59:16,369 
and the Dubrovnik Republic abolished slavery 1642nd However, while the U.S. in

1146
01:59:16,469 --> 01:59:20,140 
was still a British colony and did not even exist as a state.

1147
01:59:20,240 --> 01:59:22,675 
western hypocrisy was obvious.

1148
01:59:22,775 --> 01:59:25,512 
Why would a Croat or a Serb Serbs hated Muslims, eh?

1149
01:59:25,612 --> 01:59:29,415 
Because someone somewhere has done who knows what who knows when? Since we have so says TV?

1150
01:59:29,515 --> 01:59:34,187 
Is not that history has proven that these people can live together? Or is it all irrelevant

1151
01:59:34,287 --> 01:59:42,887 
the moment when someone pulls a story about who is who how many times did mount point?

1152
01:59:57,977 --> 02:00:03,750 
There is no biological hatred, that a group of people destined to hate another group.

1153
02:00:03,850 --> 02:00:08,454 
Anyone who says otherwise has some deeper intentions, believe me.

1154
02:00:08,554 --> 02:00:13,159 
I know what you say now. "Boris, you just criticize here, not the solution nudis'

1155
02:00:13,259 --> 02:00:17,730 
Well, when the solution is concerned, there is only need to look up to those who said 'No'

1156
02:00:17,830 --> 02:00:25,030 
madness and injustice, who decided to be good people in bad times.

1157
02:00:40,186 --> 02:00:44,057 
corrupt politicians, generals of armies and war profiteers are just as responsible in

1158
02:00:44,157 --> 02:00:48,728 
for the colonization of Yugoslavia as the colonizers from the West.

1159
02:00:48,828 --> 02:00:53,533 
No one could do this to us that we were so weak

1160
02:00:53,633 --> 02:01:01,802 
in their definition of themselves and defend their history. If we as a nation stand up

1161
02:01:02,742 --> 02:01:08,548 
No one can stop us. There are no cruise missiles, there is no imperialist power in

1162
02:01:08,648 --> 02:01:14,287 
spijuske no network, no domination of media that can destroy our people.

1163
02:01:14,387 --> 02:01:18,291 
The peoples of former Yugoslavia have become aware that their countries were colonies of the West

1164
02:01:18,391 --> 02:01:23,296 
victims of galloping globalization and soulless, related economic, social

1165
02:01:23,396 --> 02:01:31,996 
and political chains. If that happens, the weight of chains will gradually become intolerable.

1166
02:01:33,106 --> 02:01:36,743 
The country south Slavs, as long as you call, have enormous potential in

1167
02:01:36,843 --> 02:01:40,947 
that share some of the most versatile and most mysterious people of the world.

1168
02:01:41,047 --> 02:01:45,852 
East thought that they were West, West felt that they were east.

1169
02:01:45,952 --> 02:01:48,788 
Some have misunderstood their role in the current conflict in

1170
02:01:48,888 --> 02:01:53,588 
and they were exploited by outside powers for centuries.

1171
02:01:54,327 --> 02:01:56,327 
Enough.

1172
02:01:57,063 --> 02:02:01,432
