1
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:37,570
1x03
An Owl in a Thornbush

2
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:44,596
What's wrong, mother ?

3
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:45,734
Ruined.

4
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:46,853
Ruined !

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,044
That idiot has ruined us all !

6
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:50,901
We shall have to leave Rome !

7
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:53,300
Caesar has crossed the Rubicon.

8
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:55,901
He's on Italian soil under arms.

9
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,901
It's an act of gross treason.

10
00:01:57,968 --> 00:02:00,400
With a single legion, if you please.

11
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:04,634
So not merely treason,
but suicidal treason.

12
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,968
Will that be all, domina* ?

13
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:08,969
*domina = mistress

14
00:02:10,701 --> 00:02:12,150
Have you heard ?

15
00:02:13,332 --> 00:02:14,502
Strange.

16
00:02:14,503 --> 00:02:16,334
A foolish thing to do.

17
00:02:16,335 --> 00:02:18,133
One legion.

18
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,367
I wonder what he's thinking.

19
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,620
I remember back when I destroyed the Illyrian pirates*,

20
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:25,621
*Illyria is Western Crotia and Slovenia.
Pompey became famous and got the nickname of Magnus (means "the Great")
thanks to his exploits against pirates in Mediterranean Sea in 67 b. C.

21
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:28,133
There was one particular old sea snake...

22
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,034
A Liburnian*, if I recall....

23
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:30,035
*Nowadays Liburnia is the Hrvatsko Primorje, the Croatian coastal.

24
00:02:30,033 --> 00:02:33,522
Never mind the Illyrian pirates.
What is to be done ?

25
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:35,400
I have already given word.

26
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:36,901
My legions are gathering.

27
00:02:36,968 --> 00:02:38,734
And you'll crush him, yeah ?

28
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:41,567
Without question.
The poor man is dead.

29
00:02:44,868 --> 00:02:46,741
You are to take our Ubian cavalry

30
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,360
and scout all roads and defensive strong points
between here and the City*.

31
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:50,361
* With a cap letter, the City is Rome.
(cf. Pope's blessing "Urbi et orbi", "to the City and to the world")

32
00:02:50,361 --> 00:02:51,934
Advance until resistance is met.

33
00:02:51,935 --> 00:02:53,467
If and when civilians are encountered,

34
00:02:53,534 --> 00:02:55,632
deliver the enclosed proclamation.

35
00:02:57,067 --> 00:03:00,033
If you encounter no resistance,
go directly to the forum

36
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,667
and nail it to the Senate door.

37
00:03:02,334 --> 00:03:04,033
Sir.

38
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:07,467
There will be no rapine, pillage or burning.

39
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:10,501
Any questions ?

40
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:11,902
None, sir.

41
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:12,667
That will be all.

42
00:03:20,634 --> 00:03:23,534
What makes your man Vorenus so morose ?

43
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,434
He is stonewall catonian.

44
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:27,434
He thinks we've committed a terrible crime,

45
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:29,367
a mighty sacrilege,

46
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:31,834
and shall be severely punished by the gods.

47
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:34,133
- He may be right.
- It's a crime if we lose.

48
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,167
If we win, it isn't.

49
00:03:36,234 --> 00:03:39,168
I am merely pursuing my legimate rights, Antony.

50
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,968
- Of course.
- Do you think we can trust him ?

51
00:03:41,033 --> 00:03:43,167
- Who ?
- Lucius Vorenus.

52
00:03:43,234 --> 00:03:46,801
Deep 13th, him.

53
00:03:46,868 --> 00:03:49,701
He'd follow the eagle up Pluto*'s ass.

54
00:03:49,702 --> 00:03:49,702
*Pluto is the God of the Underworld and rules on the dead people.

55
00:04:08,601 --> 00:04:10,434
I told you not to come here.

56
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:20,033
I had to see my son.

57
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,501
You've seen him.
Now go.

58
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:30,734
And stay away.

59
00:04:32,767 --> 00:04:35,100
Help me, Niobe.

60
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:37,400
I'm going insane.

61
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:39,000
You can't forsake me.

62
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:40,467
I do.

63
00:04:40,534 --> 00:04:42,267
I won't give up.
Don't think I will.

64
00:04:42,334 --> 00:04:45,133
You loved me once,
you will love me again.

65
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:48,334
I never loved you.

66
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,767
Lie to yourself if you want,
but don't lie to me.

67
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:52,434
Stay away.

68
00:04:52,501 --> 00:04:54,634
You know you will never see your husband now,

69
00:04:54,701 --> 00:04:56,300
you know that, eh ?

70
00:04:56,367 --> 00:04:58,434
Him and all the rest of them are doomed.

71
00:04:58,501 --> 00:05:00,534
You don't know that.

72
00:05:00,601 --> 00:05:03,100
Everybody knows that.

73
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:06,734
That may be, but I made a vow.

74
00:05:07,868 --> 00:05:09,300
Go.

75
00:05:10,968 --> 00:05:12,534
Go.

76
00:05:15,033 --> 00:05:17,734
I swear to Dis*, if you don't go...

77
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:17,735
*Dis = other name of Pluto, god of the underworld.
Means in Latin "Rich" and so Pluto is
cause he's the king of the numerous country of the Deads and because the earth is full of precious ores.

78
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:23,400
It's all right.
He's going.

79
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:25,234
Just go.

80
00:05:28,033 --> 00:05:30,067
You promised you would never see him again.

81
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:32,467
I didn't want him here.
I told him to go.

82
00:05:32,534 --> 00:05:34,467
It didn't look like that.

83
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:40,334
You could tell papa the truth.
It's not your fault.

84
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,267
If you and I spoke to him...

85
00:05:42,334 --> 00:05:44,434
Never.
You have sworn.

86
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:46,667
You thought he was dead.
Papa will understand.

87
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:49,434
He will kill us all.

88
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:07,000
You...
You often say that you are adept with the women.

89
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,881
No idle boast neither.

90
00:06:08,882 --> 00:06:11,934
There are girls from Narbo to Thebes
that scream my name by night.

91
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:13,867
I have no need of your coital expertise.

92
00:06:13,670 --> 00:06:17,300
My question more concerns their... affections.

93
00:06:17,367 --> 00:06:20,133
I'm your man for that to boot.

94
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:24,567
My wife, she...

95
00:06:26,434 --> 00:06:28,901
You heard what she said, she hates me.

96
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:32,200
What's your question ?

97
00:06:32,234 --> 00:06:34,534
How do I stop her from hating me, obviously ?

98
00:06:34,601 --> 00:06:36,167
It's not obvious.

99
00:06:36,234 --> 00:06:38,601
I thought you were making her hate you with a purpose.

100
00:06:38,667 --> 00:06:40,801
That was not my intent at all.
Why would I do that ?

101
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:41,880
I don't know.

102
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:44,606
You're the clever one, you.
There might have been 1000 reasons.

103
00:06:45,607 --> 00:06:46,738
I love her.

104
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,801
I require that she love me also,
else I am merely her slave.

105
00:06:49,867 --> 00:06:51,411
I cannot tolerate that.

106
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,634
Well, what care you what she feels for you

107
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,234
if we're all going to die this week or next ?

108
00:06:57,235 --> 00:07:00,007
And so we are, but who will honor my name
when I am gone ?

109
00:07:00,367 --> 00:07:03,275
Who will pay Proserpina* and Pluto for my keep ?

110
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:03,276
*Proserpina is Pluto's wife, who rules the underworld.

111
00:07:03,276 --> 00:07:05,415
Who will pour wine* upon my grave ?

112
00:07:05,416 --> 00:07:05,416
*The wine is poured upon a grave for the libations for the deads.

113
00:07:06,033 --> 00:07:08,400
If it comes to that, I shall do the honors.

114
00:07:08,467 --> 00:07:09,809
It's the least I could do.

115
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:11,883
Thank you.

116
00:07:12,868 --> 00:07:15,400
But it's not the same thing.

117
00:07:15,467 --> 00:07:17,401
Besides...

118
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:18,767
You'll be dead too.

119
00:07:26,968 --> 00:07:30,434
I'm planning on having a small party this evening
and I'll need you to...

120
00:07:31,734 --> 00:07:34,234
Are you wearing perfume ?

121
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,234
Just a dab.

122
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,734
It's horrid.

123
00:07:38,801 --> 00:07:40,701
Horseshit suits you much better.

124
00:07:40,767 --> 00:07:43,734
Now I need you to get more men to stand guard outside

125
00:07:43,801 --> 00:07:46,033
to greet my guests when they arrive.

126
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,634
A party ?
Is that wise, given how things are ?

127
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,234
Perfume, advice...
Whatever next ?

128
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,400
I'm just saying Pompey's mob is out for blood.

129
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:56,100
- It's best to lay low.
- Lay low ?

130
00:07:56,167 --> 00:07:58,801
I'm not a lizard.
I will not be intimidated.

131
00:07:58,868 --> 00:08:01,434
As you like.
Cost you extra though.

132
00:08:01,501 --> 00:08:04,334
You've been paid quite adequately already.

133
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,234
More men cost more.

134
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:11,267
I will tell Castor to speak with you.

135
00:08:11,334 --> 00:08:12,934
I don't want more money.

136
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,288
Well, what do you want then ?

137
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:17,457
You know what I want.

138
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,100
Something like that.

139
00:08:23,167 --> 00:08:26,567
- You forget your place.
- My place is with my family.

140
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:29,134
Say the word, and I'll go to them.

141
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:37,300
Do your job to my satisfaction and...

142
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,133
I'll see that you're properly rewarded.

143
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,534
Thank you, domina.

144
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,149
Pompey's outriders.

145
00:09:03,367 --> 00:09:05,968
His legions won't be far behind.

146
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:09,500
Us and the rest of the 13th will be on crosses by market day.

147
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,234
Thank the gods my father didn't live to see his son die a traitor.

148
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:15,067
Best to die now then, eh ? Go on.

149
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:17,133
Wait ! We're not here to fit.

150
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:19,400
"Advance until resistance is met."

151
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:21,300
That is our orders.
That is what we do.

152
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:23,300
Why not ? The boys are ready,
aren't you, boys ?

153
00:09:23,367 --> 00:09:25,667
Let's have a go.
Come on !

154
00:09:25,734 --> 00:09:28,267
No fight !

155
00:09:28,334 --> 00:09:31,601
No ! No fight now !
Damned idiot !

156
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:37,315
Form up and defend !

157
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,800
Remember your training !

158
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:42,640
Shields !

159
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:50,419
- Hold your ground !
- Stand tall !

160
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,670
Stand tall !

161
00:09:55,172 --> 00:09:56,508
Get back, coward !

162
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:06,845
Stay in place, you cowards !
Get back here

163
00:10:09,267 --> 00:10:14,067
Caesar's scouts are only 30 miles* from Rome.

164
00:10:14,068 --> 00:10:14,068
*1 Roman mile = 1481,50 meters
30 miles = about 44 km (around 27,6 miles)

165
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:15,733
30 miles ?

166
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:18,234
His speed is uncanny.

167
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,534
Of course, he has only a very few men,

168
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,302
Which makes a fast pace easier.

169
00:10:24,033 --> 00:10:27,008
He is not leading an army so much as an armed gang.

170
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,834
It is all highly irregular, unethical even.

171
00:10:30,901 --> 00:10:33,267
Gods, it is not even the war season*.

172
00:10:33,268 --> 00:10:33,268
*War season is from March to September.

173
00:10:33,334 --> 00:10:36,667
Surely he does not think to attack Rome directly ?

174
00:10:36,734 --> 00:10:38,334
I think that is exactly what he will do.

175
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,000
How can he hope to succeed ?

176
00:10:40,067 --> 00:10:41,834
The problem is, at this moment,

177
00:10:41,901 --> 00:10:45,634
We have only three legions in arms
for the defense of the city.

178
00:10:45,701 --> 00:10:47,667
Surely, three is more than enough.

179
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,868
Normally that would be true,
but most of the men

180
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:52,801
are raw recruits like those
who fled from the scouts.

181
00:10:52,868 --> 00:10:54,934
The rest are veterans of Gaul.

182
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,901
Caesar's men...
Not reliable.

183
00:10:56,968 --> 00:10:58,400
Rome is undefended !

184
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:02,167
My legions are mustering as swiftly as possible,

185
00:11:02,234 --> 00:11:06,467
but it will take at least four days

186
00:11:06,534 --> 00:11:10,534
to assemble a force capable of defending the city.

187
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:13,567
Caesar is two days away.

188
00:11:15,601 --> 00:11:17,850
You touch it with a needle.

189
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:18,924
What do we do now then ?

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:23,440
We must make a tactical retreat to the South.
A  tactical  retreat, mind you.

191
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,502
Leace the city ?

192
00:11:24,534 --> 00:11:26,767
Juno's cunt !
Do you run mad ?

193
00:11:26,834 --> 00:11:28,467
You cannot speak to me in that tone.

194
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:30,968
My friends, let us cleave to the matter at hand.

195
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:33,567
Is there no alternative to retreathen ?

196
00:11:33,634 --> 00:11:36,567
None. We shall withdraw to Corfinium*

197
00:11:36,568 --> 00:11:36,568
*Corfinium, also called Italica (today San Pelino) is a town in the Samnium, in Italy,
between Latium, Campania and Apulia.

198
00:11:36,634 --> 00:11:38,267
and rally my legions there.

199
00:11:38,334 --> 00:11:40,501
Once they are gathered and in good order,

200
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,710
we will simply retake the city.

201
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,634
Caesar has no hope of reinforcement until spring.

202
00:11:46,701 --> 00:11:49,767
The towns of Italy will close their gates to him.

203
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:54,501
We will have an unassailable advantage
in men and resources.

204
00:11:54,367 --> 00:11:58,300
So in fact, this is not a humiliating defeat at all

205
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:00,434
but a rare species of victory ?

206
00:12:00,435 --> 00:12:01,501
Calm yourself, Cato.

207
00:12:01,502 --> 00:12:03,605
You lack understanding of things military,

208
00:12:03,606 --> 00:12:05,367
else you would see that my actions

209
00:12:05,434 --> 00:12:07,821
have been perfectly correct at all times.

210
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:11,634
You have lost Rome without unsheathing your sword.

211
00:12:11,635 --> 00:12:13,235
You lost Rome !

212
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:27,747
Did you see ?*

213
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:27,748
*This central opening in the roof of the atrium is called "compluvium" and lets in the light and the water of rain (which falls down in a pool, the impluvium.

214
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:30,667
Pompeian scum at our very door !

215
00:12:30,734 --> 00:12:32,067
It's intolerable.

216
00:12:32,634 --> 00:12:35,400
If Timon and his men weren't here,
they'd be burning down the house.

217
00:12:35,467 --> 00:12:37,067
They are not that energetic.

218
00:12:37,134 --> 00:12:40,301
This suicidal rebellion has turned everyone against us.

219
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:42,867
I swear, if Caesar were here now,

220
00:12:42,933 --> 00:12:44,768
I would stab him in the neck.

221
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,167
- He has ruined us.
- I'm not so sure of that.

222
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:50,034
But I think Pompey's position is deceptively weak.

223
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:53,134
Think, think, think...
That's all you do, you silly boy.

224
00:12:53,401 --> 00:12:55,567
All our friends have abandoned us,

225
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:58,534
Cowards that they are.
We Julii are lepers now.

226
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:02,800
Let us not exaggerate.
Not all of your friends have deserted you.

227
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:05,267
And that will be remembered.

228
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:07,200
You are good loyal people.

229
00:13:07,267 --> 00:13:09,501
It's very tempting to abandon Caesar,

230
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:12,200
but to do so now,
well, that would look like we're mere...

231
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:14,434
...slaves to fashion.

232
00:13:20,034 --> 00:13:21,668
You're staying to protect the house

233
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:24,467
but don't think for a moment that your master
and I will not return.

234
00:13:24,534 --> 00:13:26,734
We will be back by the calends* at the latest.

235
00:13:26,735 --> 00:13:26,735
*Calends are on the first day of each month.

236
00:13:26,836 --> 00:13:29,244
When I do return,
those of you I find

237
00:13:29,034 --> 00:13:31,834
have not done their utmost duty will pay with their lives.

238
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,801
General, your escort is ready.

239
00:13:35,567 --> 00:13:37,067
Gnaeus.

240
00:13:40,367 --> 00:13:43,634
Durio, is the escort ready ?

241
00:13:43,701 --> 00:13:45,833
- Ready, sir.
- Away then.

242
00:13:45,850 --> 00:13:48,001
Husband, the treasury ?

243
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:49,967
Yes, of course.

244
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:51,097
Durio.

245
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,834
You must secure

246
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,434
as much of the treasury gold as possible.

247
00:13:56,501 --> 00:14:00,501
Take a detachment and open up the Capitoline vaults.

248
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,900
There's not much time,
so do what you can.

249
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,701
Let's pretend we're Odysseus and his friends,

250
00:14:15,768 --> 00:14:18,334
creeping out of the cyclops' cave.

251
00:14:18,401 --> 00:14:21,234
We must be quiet as little mice, all right ?

252
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,200
Come.

253
00:14:29,668 --> 00:14:32,867
- Sorry about all this.
- Do not say so.

254
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:34,501
I don't mind a little excitement.

255
00:14:34,567 --> 00:14:38,034
All will be well, I assure you.

256
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,900
I have no doubt.

257
00:14:47,634 --> 00:14:49,467
Let's away.

258
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:53,667
And remember, no sound.

259
00:14:57,333 --> 00:14:58,675
Break it down !

260
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,734
Here's a mercy.

261
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:06,010
Instead of living out our lives in shame and disgrace,

262
00:15:06,367 --> 00:15:07,934
w
e are to be raped and beaten

263
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,667
and torn limb from limb by a raving mob.

264
00:15:13,701 --> 00:15:16,634
These brutes will not let you pass, I think.

265
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:19,601
You may stay the night if you want.

266
00:15:19,667 --> 00:15:21,868
We would be delighted, thank you.

267
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:22,034
Wait wait.
Wrong way.

268
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,434
The Appian gate is to the right.

269
00:16:24,501 --> 00:16:26,300
We're not going to the appian.

270
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,567
What ?

271
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,301
Of course, your best method for pleasing a woman

272
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:47,467
is the warm, beating heart of an enemy.

273
00:16:47,534 --> 00:16:49,833
Women will say they don't like it, but they do.

274
00:16:49,850 --> 00:16:51,501
It makes them wet as October.

275
00:16:51,502 --> 00:16:53,267
That doesn't answer.

276
00:16:53,334 --> 00:16:55,501
Well, failing that, talk to her.

277
00:16:55,868 --> 00:16:56,533
Talk ?

278
00:16:57,767 --> 00:17:00,601
- But of what ?
- That doesn't matter.

279
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:02,501
It's all about the tone of the voice.

280
00:17:02,667 --> 00:17:05,634
You pretend like you're putting a saddle on a skittish horse.

281
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:08,300
"There, honey.
Shh, come now."

282
00:17:08,367 --> 00:17:09,767
You know, that sort of thing.

283
00:17:10,133 --> 00:17:12,934
- That's all ?
- What else ?

284
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:16,601
Oh ! Tell her she is beautiful all the time.

285
00:17:16,667 --> 00:17:19,567
Tell her she's beautiful every time you see her,

286
00:17:19,634 --> 00:17:21,234
even when she's not.

287
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:23,234
And what else ?

288
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:27,934
Oh ! Also, very important...

289
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,601
When you couple with her, there's a spot just above her cunny...

290
00:17:31,667 --> 00:17:32,934
It's like little button.

291
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,434
Now, attend to that button,

292
00:17:35,501 --> 00:17:37,834
and she will open up like a flower.

293
00:17:37,901 --> 00:17:39,968
How do you know this of her ?

294
00:17:41,701 --> 00:17:43,367
All women have them.

295
00:17:43,434 --> 00:17:45,234
Ask anyone.

296
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,701
Ho ho ho, very pretty.
Come up behind !

297
00:17:52,767 --> 00:17:54,934
- Come with us !
- Sit up here !

298
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:57,000
You can make me happy !

299
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:01,167
It'll make me happy.

300
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:03,767
Here you go. Up you go.

301
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:06,501
Come on !

302
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:23,534
I will kill Octavia,
and Merula tends to me,

303
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:25,135
but if she cannot, and I am taken alive,

304
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,684
then you must kill me.

305
00:18:27,434 --> 00:18:28,800
And then you must kill yourself.

306
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,334
Your survival would be inappropriate.

307
00:18:31,401 --> 00:18:33,067
I would not think of living, domina.

308
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,716
Octavian, who would you prefer kills you ?

309
00:18:35,134 --> 00:18:36,541
I am old enough to take care of myself.

310
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,716
Oh, that's my brave little man.

311
00:18:39,533 --> 00:18:40,934
Servilia...

312
00:18:41,301 --> 00:18:43,767
Can my people be of any assistance to you ?

313
00:18:43,834 --> 00:18:46,401
Thank you but I'm sure we can manage by ourselves somehow.

314
00:18:46,468 --> 00:18:47,934
Very well.

315
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,900
Mother, I would rather it were not you killed me

316
00:18:49,967 --> 00:18:51,867
if you have no objection.

317
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:54,434
Why ever not ?
You can't still be angry with me.

318
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,167
- Is that an order ?
- Bona dea* !

319
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:56,168
*Bona dea means "the good goddess".
Faunus' daughter, sometimes called Fauna, she was a goddess of fertility, healing, virginity and women.

320
00:18:56,234 --> 00:18:57,700
I feel like you have never listened...

321
00:18:57,767 --> 00:19:01,001
Cerberus* is howling for us, and still you plague me

322
00:19:01,002 --> 00:19:01,002
* Three-headed dog with back spiked with heads of snakes. He's the warden of the gates of the Underworld.

323
00:19:01,067 --> 00:19:02,700
with your ridiculous feelings ?

324
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,600
If you had only let Glabius and I remarry...

325
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:06,267
Oh, always Glabius !

326
00:19:06,334 --> 00:19:07,807
I spit on Glabius !

327
00:19:08,112 --> 00:19:09,735
I piss on the wretch !

328
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,633
Oh, that's right, mother, die as you have lived...

329
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:13,400
- Poison brimming in your soul !
- Listen !

330
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,449
I'll not argue with you.

331
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:17,868
Castor, be sure to cut Octavia's throat
before you cut mine.

332
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:19,867
Please, Castor, let mother do it.

333
00:19:19,934 --> 00:19:21,734
I won't deny her one last pleasure.

334
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:22,921
It would be undaughterly.

335
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,068
Listen !

336
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:06,301
Consul Gnaeus Pompey Magnus has left the city.

337
00:20:06,368 --> 00:20:11,067
He commands all noblemen and knights* to do likewise.

338
00:20:11,068 --> 00:20:11,068
*The knights or "equestrians" are one of the two upper social classes in Rome.

339
00:20:12,667 --> 00:20:14,800
Those that remain will be considered

340
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:17,867
-  enemies of Rome.
- Cowards !

341
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:42,834
You heard, then.

342
00:20:42,900 --> 00:20:44,667
Don't know what good that will do.

343
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:46,433
Anyone wants to get in, they'll get in.

344
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,367
Give us a hand, will you ?

345
00:20:50,234 --> 00:20:52,867
So your man will be back after all, looks like.

346
00:20:52,934 --> 00:20:54,067
It looks like.

347
00:20:56,001 --> 00:20:57,500
You don't sound too happy about it.

348
00:20:57,501 --> 00:20:58,954
Of course I'm happy.
He's my husband.

349
00:20:58,955 --> 00:21:00,121
If you say so.

350
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:05,667
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:05,734 --> 00:21:07,334
I was just talking.

352
00:21:07,401 --> 00:21:09,533
I talk too much.

353
00:21:10,533 --> 00:21:12,468
I don't know, Rissa.

354
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:16,201
I try my best to love him, I do.

355
00:21:19,067 --> 00:21:21,200
I don't know whether I want him to come back.

356
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:26,967
I would not credit it if I had not seen it myself.

357
00:21:27,034 --> 00:21:30,700
Pompey's men deserting the city,
deserting Rome,

358
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:32,201
Half the Senate ahorse.

359
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:34,067
A comical sight no doubt.

360
00:21:34,034 --> 00:21:35,722
Gods.

361
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:37,196
We...

362
00:21:37,497 --> 00:21:41,500
...are in a damned awkward position.

363
00:21:41,767 --> 00:21:43,567
If we stay...

364
00:21:43,633 --> 00:21:46,867
we are declaring for Caesar,
for rebellion.

365
00:21:46,934 --> 00:21:48,531
And if we go, we...

366
00:21:48,871 --> 00:21:52,202
We are with Pompey and the Senate.
There is no middle ground.

367
00:21:52,203 --> 00:21:53,704
So what is the answer ?

368
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:57,500
Caesar is our dearest friend, but what he is doing is...

369
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,334
I do not know.

370
00:22:04,301 --> 00:22:06,001
You must decide.

371
00:22:16,201 --> 00:22:18,034
Pompey then.

372
00:22:18,101 --> 00:22:19,767
We must go with Pompey.

373
00:22:19,834 --> 00:22:22,301
The republic is more important than any friendship.

374
00:22:22,368 --> 00:22:24,401
- Do you agree ?
- It's your decision.

375
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,468
Pompey then.

376
00:22:26,533 --> 00:22:28,001
Pompey then.

377
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:31,167
We have no time to lose.

378
00:22:31,234 --> 00:22:33,600
Tell your women to be ready to leave as soon as possible.

379
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:36,123
I'm not leaving.

380
00:22:37,034 --> 00:22:38,281
What do you mean ?

381
00:22:39,001 --> 00:22:41,201
I've waited eight years for Caesar.

382
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:43,500
I cannot leave now.

383
00:22:43,567 --> 00:22:45,900
You cannot stay, not if I go.

384
00:22:45,967 --> 00:22:48,001
Course I can stay.

385
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,834
I can do as I wish.

386
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,301
Mother, all who stay are enemies of Rome.

387
00:22:53,368 --> 00:22:55,834
- Pompey has declared it.
- Caesar might prevail.

388
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,567
Yes, he might rule Rome for a week, a month, a year even,

389
00:22:59,633 --> 00:23:01,834
but then some other ambitious man

390
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,767
will kill him and take his place,

391
00:23:03,834 --> 00:23:06,334
And you then will be the mistress of a dead tyrant.

392
00:23:06,401 --> 00:23:08,934
Mother, we know what happens to them.

393
00:23:09,001 --> 00:23:10,533
That is for the gods decide.

394
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:12,567
I cannot help loving him.

395
00:23:12,633 --> 00:23:14,267
A va, mother !

396
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:16,434
You...You are blinded by untapped lust.

397
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:20,067
I'll get you a good big Cyrenian* at the market
and have done with it !

398
00:23:20,068 --> 00:23:20,068
*Cyrenaica is an African province,
limited to the West by Egypt and to the South by Lybia.

399
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,434
You'd better go.

400
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:28,967
Don't be angry with me.

401
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,401
We may be parted for a long time.

402
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:37,034
Come.

403
00:23:57,201 --> 00:23:59,134
Goodbye, mother.

404
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:02,234
Goodbye, my love.

405
00:24:20,301 --> 00:24:21,468
Your daughter left.

406
00:24:23,334 --> 00:24:24,307
When ?

407
00:24:24,501 --> 00:24:27,134
Just now.
I put a boy to following her.

408
00:24:27,201 --> 00:24:29,867
I'll put a stop to this nonsense.

409
00:24:36,101 --> 00:24:37,892
Fetch your men.

410
00:24:38,455 --> 00:24:39,455
What ?

411
00:24:39,456 --> 00:24:40,327
Now.

412
00:24:55,567 --> 00:24:57,201
Why have you not left the city ?

413
00:24:57,267 --> 00:24:58,567
I could not leave without seeing you.

414
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:01,301
It's not safe for you.
Everyone knows you're with Pompey.

415
00:25:01,368 --> 00:25:04,034
Don't fret.
I'll be gone by sunrise.

416
00:25:46,700 --> 00:25:48,900
- That's all I have.
- Thank you.

417
00:25:48,967 --> 00:25:50,867
But this is not a robbery.

418
00:25:54,267 --> 00:25:57,368
- Atia.
- I'll give you a moment,

419
00:25:57,434 --> 00:25:59,600
if there are gods you'd like to speak to.

420
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:03,934
One favor...
Let my men live.

421
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:06,368
Sorry.
It's orders.

422
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,068
Give me your sword.

423
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:47,543
What are they, the stars ?

424
00:26:47,634 --> 00:26:48,619
Stars ?

425
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,647
Holes in the celestial spheres.

426
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,677
Holes through which the light of the heavens shine.

427
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:57,086
How big are these holes ?

428
00:26:57,234 --> 00:26:58,967
They're big.

429
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,368
They only seem small to us because they're hundreds of miles away.

430
00:27:02,434 --> 00:27:04,350
Big enough for a man to climb through ?

431
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:06,234
I suppose.

432
00:27:07,734 --> 00:27:10,368
But man would never be able to
get up there in the first place.

433
00:27:10,434 --> 00:27:11,410
I don't see why not.

434
00:27:11,532 --> 00:27:12,532
How ?

435
00:27:12,867 --> 00:27:16,301
He could hold onto a giant bird.

436
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,234
It doesn't work like that.

437
00:27:22,301 --> 00:27:23,500
- Why not ?
- It's philosophy.

438
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:27,001
It's hard to explain.

439
00:27:40,268 --> 00:27:42,000
Really, Numa, that's quite unnecessary.

440
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:43,782
I beg you stand.

441
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,500
There shall be no formality here,

442
00:27:45,501 --> 00:27:47,567
not between old friends like us.

443
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,106
A thousand gratitudes, Atia.

444
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,434
We humbly seek the protection
and friendship of your family.

445
00:27:52,567 --> 00:27:54,434
Sadly, there are some people who say

446
00:27:54,501 --> 00:27:56,802
That I am of the pompeian faction.

447
00:27:56,803 --> 00:27:58,060
Are you not ?

448
00:27:58,100 --> 00:28:00,423
All of Pompey's faction have long since fled.

449
00:28:00,434 --> 00:28:03,967
You stay for fear your factories and storehouses will be looted.

450
00:28:03,834 --> 00:28:05,968
I assure you, that's not true...

451
00:28:06,033 --> 00:28:07,500
Castor.

452
00:28:10,501 --> 00:28:13,434
- 5000 denarii.
- That much ?

453
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:15,934
- I... I...
- Please, let us not be vulgar.

454
00:28:15,935 --> 00:28:18,701
I'll make the arrangements immediately.

455
00:28:37,567 --> 00:28:39,400
Where is your man Durio ?

456
00:28:39,467 --> 00:28:41,300
He is long overdue now.

457
00:28:41,367 --> 00:28:43,234
Durio is the best man I have.

458
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:44,868
He won't fail.

459
00:28:44,934 --> 00:28:46,658
But if not, what then ?

460
00:28:47,067 --> 00:28:49,734
How do we pay the legions ?
How do we feed them ?

461
00:28:49,801 --> 00:28:52,868
I have not the least idea.
You fret like a woman, Cato.

462
00:28:52,934 --> 00:28:57,734
Durio will return with more than enough gold to feed and pay the legions.

463
00:28:57,801 --> 00:29:00,801
By any road we'll be back in Rome before spring,

464
00:29:00,868 --> 00:29:03,267
so stop worrying.

465
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:13,734
It makes no sense.

466
00:29:13,801 --> 00:29:15,534
We should have been stopped by now.

467
00:29:15,601 --> 00:29:17,434
Why is Rome not defended ?

468
00:29:17,501 --> 00:29:19,367
Our boys scared 'em off, eh ?

469
00:29:19,434 --> 00:29:23,586
Soldiers of the republic do not run,
so it must be a stratagem or trick.

470
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:24,968
Then it's a good trick.

471
00:29:25,033 --> 00:29:27,334
Unless the gods have abandoned Rome.

472
00:29:27,601 --> 00:29:29,534
If Mars* was watching,

473
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:29,535
*Mars is the god of the war.

474
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:31,601
he would not allow such a disgrace.

475
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:34,000
Well, maybe he was having a crap and missed it.

476
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:37,667
It's that sort of disrespect that has led us to this sad pass.

477
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:41,334
If the gods are not respected,
hen why should they help us ?

478
00:29:44,567 --> 00:29:46,767
Still no troops.

479
00:29:47,334 --> 00:29:49,734
They will have flanked us, I expect.

480
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:51,367
Perhaps these drovers know something.

481
00:30:05,801 --> 00:30:08,167
- Salve*, citizens.
- Captain.

482
00:30:08,168 --> 00:30:08,168
*Salve = expression of greeting

483
00:30:08,234 --> 00:30:10,467
- You come from the City ?
- We do.

484
00:30:10,534 --> 00:30:11,396
How goes it there ?

485
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,068
You're Caesar's men.

486
00:30:13,133 --> 00:30:14,236
We are.

487
00:30:14,335 --> 00:30:15,911
Fortune spreads her legs for you.

488
00:30:15,801 --> 00:30:18,400
Pompey has fled.
The city is yours.

489
00:30:18,467 --> 00:30:19,964
Why would Pompey flee ?

490
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,829
You boys were too fast for him.

491
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:23,901
He couldn't raise his armies quick enough.

492
00:30:23,968 --> 00:30:25,413
Him and his men are retreating South,

493
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,786
and the Senate with 'em.

494
00:30:26,787 --> 00:30:28,334
See ?
Wrong for once.

495
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,734
Well, uh, enjoy your victory boys.

496
00:30:30,801 --> 00:30:33,767
- How much do you want for the girl ?
- Not for sale.

497
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:36,067
What's in the wagon ?

498
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:38,400
- Grain.
- Show us, soldier.

499
00:30:38,467 --> 00:30:39,916
There's no soldiers here.

500
00:30:39,068 --> 00:30:42,047
My mistake.
You all wear the soldier's boot,

501
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:44,234
So I assumed you are soldiers, but I'm wrong.

502
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:47,267
But why would nine good soldiers
be guarding a grain wagon ?

503
00:30:47,334 --> 00:30:49,267
I don't have to show you nothing.

504
00:31:40,168 --> 00:31:43,415
My fidelity, always, domina.

505
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:47,634
I do not like to doubt you, Proculus, but

506
00:31:47,901 --> 00:31:51,060
it's an age since I have seen you at my morning levy*.

507
00:31:51,061 --> 00:31:51,061
*Here is a scene between a patron (rich benefeactor)
and the clients (freed slaves or foreign people living in Rome: they aren't citizens).
Each morning, the client had to come and greet the patron ("salutatio"),
and could get some food.

508
00:31:51,601 --> 00:31:54,000
Perhaps you have been unwell.
Goiters is it ?

509
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:56,467
Ah, uh...
Goiters, as you say.

510
00:31:56,534 --> 00:31:58,667
Fat, greedy men often find it so.

511
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:02,334
I shall kill an owl that your good health continue.

512
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:14,467
Speak sense, you creature.

513
00:32:22,767 --> 00:32:24,602
What vile trade is this ?

514
00:32:24,715 --> 00:32:26,712
Bringing corpses to honest* doors ?!

515
00:32:26,713 --> 00:32:26,713
*Atia's indignation isn't any fake: death is considered as a stain.

516
00:32:26,701 --> 00:32:28,000
Take it away !

517
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:38,564
See what you have done !

518
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,667
The city's unguarded.

519
00:32:57,734 --> 00:33:00,334
It's true then.
The republic is fallen.

520
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,734
Yet the sky is still above us, and the earth still below.

521
00:33:02,801 --> 00:33:04,734
- Strange.
- The gods are in no hurry.

522
00:33:04,801 --> 00:33:06,667
They will take their time in tormenting us.

523
00:33:06,734 --> 00:33:08,968
Let's go back and see what's in that wagon.
Untie that girl.

524
00:33:09,033 --> 00:33:10,800
Not our concern.
We follow orders.

525
00:33:10,867 --> 00:33:12,680
Advance until resistance is met.

526
00:33:12,801 --> 00:33:15,367
- But that poor girl...
- You will do your duty.

527
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:18,167
You are a mean bastard,
that's your problem.

528
00:33:18,234 --> 00:33:19,800
You've no love in you.

529
00:33:19,834 --> 00:33:22,860
You can talk sweet as you like to Niobe,
it won't do you any good.

530
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,734
She won't believe a word.

531
00:33:29,434 --> 00:33:31,234
Hercule, you wake at last.

532
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:33,301
I was worried.

533
00:33:33,368 --> 00:33:35,234
Water ?

534
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:39,867
My poor baby.

535
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:41,800
It was not a dream then.

536
00:33:44,201 --> 00:33:45,633
Glabius is dead.

537
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,201
He is.

538
00:33:49,967 --> 00:33:51,667
I'm sorry.

539
00:34:03,101 --> 00:34:04,800
Why do you look at me like that ?

540
00:34:04,867 --> 00:34:06,401
Like what ?

541
00:34:06,468 --> 00:34:09,034
As if  I...

542
00:34:09,101 --> 00:34:10,134
Did you ?
- How can you ask me that question ?
- Did you ?

543
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:14,035
- How can you ask me that question ?
- Did you ?

544
00:34:16,134 --> 00:34:17,734
I did not !

545
00:34:18,767 --> 00:34:20,834
And I'm tortured that you would harbor such a...

546
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:21,600
...horrible notion.

547
00:34:21,650 --> 00:34:22,637
Look at me !

548
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:31,390
Daughter...

549
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,235
I swear on the masks* of all my ancestors

550
00:34:35,236 --> 00:34:35,236
*Atia talks about death masks made for the cult of the ancestors.

551
00:34:35,301 --> 00:34:37,500
that I had nothing...

552
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:40,401
nothing to do with the killing of Glabius.

553
00:34:43,700 --> 00:34:45,800
Who do you think did it, mamma ?

554
00:34:47,301 --> 00:34:49,101
The streets are full of corpses.

555
00:34:49,167 --> 00:34:51,001
It could have been anyone.

556
00:35:22,468 --> 00:35:25,967
<i>"These are the words of Gaius Julius Caesar,

557

<i>proconsul* of Gaul,

*During the republic a proconsul is a consul who rules a province at end of his office, or some deputy in this office.

561

<i>glorious imperator* of the Northern legions.

562
00:35:32,573 --> 00:35:32,573
*"imperator" doesn't mean "empereor" but "general".

563
00:35:32,967 --> 00:35:35,468
<i>Citizens, I have returned to Italy

564

<i>These are the words of Gaius Julius Caesar."

580
00:36:17,368 --> 00:36:18,800
What are you doing ?

581
00:36:18,867 --> 00:36:20,633
I have done my duty and I have sinned enough.

582
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:22,301
I resign.

583
00:36:22,368 --> 00:36:24,234
That's desertion !

584
00:36:24,301 --> 00:36:26,700
I am a traitor and a rebel.

585
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,767
Why not a deserter as well ?

586
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:30,600
You can't just leave the 13th.

587
00:36:38,267 --> 00:36:39,745
Goodbye, Pullo.

588
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:49,867
To Venus The Birth-Giver*,
I make this sacrifice.

589
00:36:49,868 --> 00:36:49,868
*In Latin, Venus Genitrix, "Venus the Mother", godess of the love, beauty and fertility.

590
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:55,700
I am Lucius of the Vorenian clan, tribe of Stellatina*,

591
00:36:55,701 --> 00:36:55,701
*There were 35 tribes in Rome and every citizen belonged to one of them.

592
00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:58,667
formerly first spear centurion to the prime cohort

593
00:36:58,734 --> 00:37:00,633
of the 13th legion.

594
00:37:02,201 --> 00:37:03,900
I have a wife.

595
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:05,767
Her name is Niobe.

596
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:11,267
Venus, let her love me as I love her.

597
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:20,368
I give my blood to make it so.

598
00:37:39,034 --> 00:37:41,034
Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you.

599
00:37:55,934 --> 00:37:58,134
You're very beautiful.

600
00:38:01,001 --> 00:38:01,974
I've come to see that...

601
00:38:03,082 --> 00:38:04,774
...it may be, through ignorance,

602
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:07,134
that I have not treated you as I should.

603
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:08,567
- As I should treat you.
- Please, don't.

604
00:38:08,633 --> 00:38:11,401
When we married you had only 13 summers,

605
00:38:11,468 --> 00:38:13,234
and soon enough I was gone.

606
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:16,411
But now you are a woman,

607
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:18,548
and I know nothing of women.

608
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,067
Soldiering is all I know.

609
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:22,401
Which is not useful.

610
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,504
I have been sullen

611
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,450
and untrusting and cold.

612
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:32,134
But I am not made of stone.

613
00:38:34,934 --> 00:38:36,534
I can change.

614
00:38:37,201 --> 00:38:39,001
I will swear on the life of my daughter's son.

615
00:38:39,334 --> 00:38:41,552
I will change, if you would have it so.

616
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,600
Please, speak if you would not have it so,

617
00:38:44,667 --> 00:38:46,189
And I will leave without rancor.

618
00:38:51,134 --> 00:38:54,567
- It is I have done wrong.
- How so ?

619
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:00,667
I am...

620
00:39:01,734 --> 00:39:03,500
I have not been...

621
00:39:10,334 --> 00:39:11,852
The past is gone.

622
00:39:12,734 --> 00:39:14,671
Can we start again ?

623
00:41:45,684 --> 00:41:47,549
I applaud you.

624
00:41:48,001 --> 00:41:51,226
You're about to enter Rome as a bloodstained conqueror,

625
00:41:51,227 --> 00:41:53,294
and yet you look as calm as a cup of water.

626
00:41:54,535 --> 00:41:56,467
I am glad I appear so.

627
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,393
Gracchus !

628
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:12,351
Something more cheerful.

629
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:30,631
