1
00:02:01,143 --> 00:02:03,544
Sometimes I stand
looking at my wife

2
00:02:04,438 --> 00:02:06,804
without her knowing I'm here.

3
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:13,039
The first time she
entered that room she said,

4
00:02:13,016 --> 00:02:15,483
"Oh, how nice.
I feel at home here. "

5
00:02:16,824 --> 00:02:19,918
We hadn't known
each other long.

6
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:22,155
We met at a bishops'
conference In Trondheim.

7
00:02:22,231 --> 00:02:25,133
She was there as a journalist.

8
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:30,072
I told her about
the parsonage out here.

9
00:02:30,776 --> 00:02:34,804
I ventured to suggest a visit

10
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:36,367
when the conference was over.

11
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:42,179
On the way, I asked
her to marry me.

12
00:02:43,001 --> 00:02:49,805
She didn't answer, but when
we entered the room she said,

13
00:02:49,946 --> 00:02:52,541
"Oh, how nice.
I feel at home here. "

14
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:59,929
Since then we've lived a quiet,
happy Iife at the parsonage.

15
00:03:00,154 --> 00:03:03,318
Eva has, of course, told me
about her earlier life.

16
00:03:03,995 --> 00:03:08,762
After leaving school
she went on to college

17
00:03:08,731 --> 00:03:13,600
got engaged to a doctor and
lived with him for several years.

18
00:03:14,907 --> 00:03:18,502
Wrote two small books.

19
00:03:18,779 --> 00:03:22,772
Came down with tuberculosis,
broke offthe engagement

20
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,877
and moved from Oslo to a small
town In the south of Norway

21
00:03:27,997 --> 00:03:30,989
where she began
to work as a journalist.

22
00:03:31,933 --> 00:03:36,267
This is the first of her books.
I like it so much.

23
00:03:36,732 --> 00:03:38,597
She has written,

24
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:45,648
"One must learn to live.
I practice every day.

25
00:03:45,596 --> 00:03:49,828
" My biggest obstacle is
I don't know who I am.

26
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:51,517
"I grope blindly.

27
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,216
"If anyone loves me as I am

28
00:03:55,262 --> 00:03:58,560
"I may dare at last
to look at myself.

29
00:03:59,454 --> 00:04:04,447
" For me, that possibility
is fairly remote."

30
00:04:09,183 --> 00:04:12,846
I'd like to tell her just for once

31
00:04:12,863 --> 00:04:16,857
that she is loved
whole-heartedly

32
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,627
but I can't say it
in such a way

33
00:04:20,671 --> 00:04:24,972
that she'd believe me.
I can't find the right words.

34
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:53,882
I've written to Mama.
Am I interrupting?

35
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:59,723
-No, no. Come in. I'll turn offthe radio.
-I can come back later.

36
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,913
No, please read me the letter.

37
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:07,674
" Dearest Mama, I was in town
yesterday and ran into Agnes

38
00:05:07,650 --> 00:05:11,382
"who was on a visit
to her parents.

39
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,590
"She told me Leonardo had died.

40
00:05:14,339 --> 00:05:19,868
"I know what a terrible
blow this must be to you.

41
00:05:19,812 --> 00:05:21,904
"I'm wondering now if you'd
like to come and visit us

42
00:05:21,987 --> 00:05:25,514
"for a few days or weeks.

43
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,537
"So that you won't
say no right off

44
00:05:29,572 --> 00:05:32,541
"the parsonage is very spacious.

45
00:05:32,579 --> 00:05:35,913
"You'll have your own
room with all conveniences.

46
00:05:36,356 --> 00:05:40,382
"We have a piano and you can
practice all you want to.

47
00:05:40,388 --> 00:05:43,620
"It would make a change from a hotel.

48
00:05:44,069 --> 00:05:46,434
" Do say you'll come!

49
00:05:46,502 --> 00:05:50,562
"We'll make a fuss
over you and spoil you.

50
00:05:50,565 --> 00:05:53,591
"It's ages since we last met.

51
00:05:53,637 --> 00:05:55,537
"7 years this October!

52
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:58,910
" Much love from Viktor and Eva."

53
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,850
-That's fine.
-Are you sure?

54
00:06:54,858 --> 00:06:59,954
-Mama darling!
-Eva! Well, here I am!

55
00:06:59,914 --> 00:07:04,441
-I'm so glad you're here.
-Yes,just fancy. It was a long trip.

56
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:09,227
-Yes, I know.
-How beautiful it is here!

57
00:07:09,194 --> 00:07:12,390
-Do stay a long time.
-Indeed I will.

58
00:07:12,426 --> 00:07:17,557
-I can't believe you're here.
-Let's go for a nice long walk.

59
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:21,574
-What heavy bags! Have you brought all your music?
-Yes,

60
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:24,480
I'm staying for good!
-It would be nice.

61
00:07:24,523 --> 00:07:28,050
-You'll give me some lessons,won't you?
-Yes.

62
00:07:28,075 --> 00:07:30,600
Where's Viktor?
-He's not at home for the moment.

63
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:34,262
We didn't think
you'd come so early.

64
00:07:34,892 --> 00:07:37,052
-This is your room.
-Oh, isn't it nice!

65
00:07:37,964 --> 00:07:42,333
And what a beautiful view.
-The bathroom's here.

66
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:50,028
-How nice and up-to-date.
-I hope one wardrobe is enough.

67
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:53,630
Everything's fine.
I really am very tired.

68
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:58,411
I sat with Leonardo
the last day and night.

69
00:07:58,381 --> 00:08:01,510
He was in bad pain and was
given shots every two hours.

70
00:08:02,157 --> 00:08:06,891
Now and then he cried
because it hurt.

71
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,295
He wasn't afraid of dying.

72
00:08:09,165 --> 00:08:14,160
Outside the hospital
they were drilling and hammering.

73
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:19,120
The sun was blazing down
and there were no awnings.

74
00:08:19,438 --> 00:08:24,637
We tried to get another room but
many wards were closed for repairs.

75
00:08:25,422 --> 00:08:28,984
Towards evening the noise stopped
and I could open the window.

76
00:08:29,007 --> 00:08:34,139
The heat outside was like a wall,
and not a breath of wind.

77
00:08:35,855 --> 00:08:39,757
In the evening the doctor came.
He's an old friend.

78
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:43,702
He said it wouldn't be long now.

79
00:08:44,527 --> 00:08:50,558
Leonardo would get a shot every half
-hour so he could die without pain.

80
00:08:51,503 --> 00:08:54,268
Then the doctor left
and the ward nurse came in.

81
00:08:56,209 --> 00:08:59,006
She said I should eat,
but I wasn't hungry.

82
00:09:00,177 --> 00:09:02,611
The smell was making me sick.

83
00:09:04,786 --> 00:09:07,220
Leonardo dozed off

84
00:09:08,593 --> 00:09:13,759
then woke up and asked me
to go out of the room.

85
00:09:14,578 --> 00:09:18,513
He rang for the night nurse
and she came in with a shot.

86
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:24,895
A minute or two later
she came out and said

87
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,794
Leonardo was dead.

88
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:35,150
I sat with him all night.

89
00:09:36,371 --> 00:09:39,238
He had been my
friend for 1 8 years.

90
00:09:39,283 --> 00:09:44,721
We had lived together for thirteen
and had never had an angry word.

91
00:09:46,387 --> 00:09:49,447
For two years he had known he was
ill and that there was no hope.

92
00:09:50,868 --> 00:09:54,737
As often as I could I went to
see him at his villa near Naples.

93
00:09:56,660 --> 00:10:01,962
He was kind and thoughtful
and happy about my success.

94
00:10:02,581 --> 00:10:06,984
We talked and joked
and played chamber music.

95
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:13,337
He hardly ever spoke of his illness
and he wouldn't have liked me to ask.

96
00:10:52,407 --> 00:10:55,433
One day he gave me a long look

97
00:10:56,535 --> 00:10:59,197
then laughed and said:

98
00:11:00,984 --> 00:11:04,818
"This time next year I'll be gone

99
00:11:05,849 --> 00:11:10,445
"but I'll always be with you.
I'll always think of you."

100
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:17,899
It was sweet of him to say so

101
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:19,677
but he was apt to be
rather theatrical.

102
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,354
I can't say I go around grieving.

103
00:11:23,962 --> 00:11:27,658
Of course he's left a gap,
but it's no good fretting.

104
00:11:27,674 --> 00:11:30,734
Do you think I've changed much?

105
00:11:30,778 --> 00:11:34,838
-You're just the same.
-I dye my hair of course.

106
00:11:34,842 --> 00:11:37,676
Otherwise I'm the same,
don't you think?

107
00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:42,126
I bought this outfit in Z'rich.
Saw it in a window

108
00:11:42,107 --> 00:11:46,009
went in and tried it on
and it fit perfectly.

109
00:11:46,012 --> 00:11:50,038
-Don't you think it's nice?
-Yes, very.

110
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:54,105
Will you help me with this case?
My back's giving me hell.

111
00:11:55,163 --> 00:11:59,100
Have you a board
to put under the mattress?

112
00:11:59,099 --> 00:12:02,466
We put one there yesterday.

113
00:12:02,908 --> 00:12:08,471
Eva dear, what is it?
Have I said something wrong?

114
00:12:08,411 --> 00:12:11,074
I'm just so glad to see you.

115
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:15,877
Give me a nice squeezy hug,
as you did when you were little.

116
00:12:16,989 --> 00:12:20,617
I've done nothing
but chattered about myself.

117
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:24,796
Tell me about you.
How are things?

118
00:12:24,798 --> 00:12:29,928
-Oh, fine.
-Don't you lead a very isolated life?

119
00:12:29,886 --> 00:12:34,880
-No, we have our parish work.
-Yes, of course.

120
00:12:34,846 --> 00:12:39,840
I often play the organ.
Last month I had a musical evening.

121
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:45,176
I played and talked
about each piece.

122
00:12:45,119 --> 00:12:49,077
-I hope you'll play for me.
-I'd love to.

123
00:12:49,087 --> 00:12:51,418
I gave five school
concerts in Los Angeles.

124
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:54,547
3,000 children each time.

125
00:12:54,592 --> 00:12:59,894
I played and talked to them.
I was a huge success.

126
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,171
There's something
I have to tell you.

127
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,503
Helena is here.

128
00:13:13,856 --> 00:13:15,948
You should have told me.

129
00:13:16,928 --> 00:13:20,694
If I had, you
wouldn't have come.

130
00:13:20,705 --> 00:13:22,866
I'm sure I would have.

131
00:13:22,944 --> 00:13:24,844
And I'm sure you wouldn't.

132
00:13:25,536 --> 00:13:31,100
Isn't Leonardo's death enough?
Why drag poor Lena here too?

133
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,976
She's been here for
the last two years.

134
00:13:34,722 --> 00:13:38,988
Viktor and I asked her
if she'd like to live with us.

135
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:44,008
-I wrote to you.
-I never got the letter.

136
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:46,003
Or else you never
bothered to read it.

137
00:13:47,363 --> 00:13:51,321
-Aren't you being rather unfair?
-Yes. I'm sorry.

138
00:13:53,764 --> 00:13:56,994
I'm not up to seeing her.
At any rate not today.

139
00:13:57,923 --> 00:14:02,360
Helena is a wonderful person.

140
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:08,107
She's longing to see you.
-It seemed so nice for her at that home.

141
00:14:08,036 --> 00:14:12,200
-I wanted her with me.
-Are you sure she's better off here?

142
00:14:12,197 --> 00:14:15,859
Yes. And I have
someone to look after.

143
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:23,507
Has she... I mean is she...
Is she worse?

144
00:14:23,749 --> 00:14:27,446
Oh yes, she's worse.
It's part of the disease.

145
00:14:31,364 --> 00:14:33,025
Come along then,
let's go and see her.

146
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:38,765
-Are you sure?
-I have no choice.

147
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:44,484
Some people are so naive.

148
00:14:45,126 --> 00:14:48,527
-You mean me?
-If the shoe fits.

149
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:04,770
Dear Lena!

150
00:15:06,374 --> 00:15:11,108
I've thought of you
so often, every day.

151
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:20,103
Helena is afraid
of giving you her cold.

152
00:15:20,135 --> 00:15:24,266
I haven't had a cold
for twenty years.

153
00:15:25,896 --> 00:15:29,093
What a lovely room you have!

154
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:31,120
I have the same
view from my room.

155
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:44,736
Helena wants you
to take her head

156
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:48,406
in your hands.
-Like that?

157
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:55,590
I'm so glad Eva's
looking after you.

158
00:15:55,594 --> 00:16:00,155
I thought you were still at that
home. I would have come to visit.

159
00:16:00,138 --> 00:16:02,231
But it's much better
like this, isn't it?

160
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:05,406
Now we can be
together every day.

161
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:13,411
-Are you in pain?
-No.

162
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:27,614
-How nicely you've done your hair.
-It's in your honor.

163
00:16:27,756 --> 00:16:32,989
Suppose I read aloud to you?
Would you like that?

164
00:16:34,093 --> 00:16:38,656
And we can go for a drive.
I've never been around here before.

165
00:16:43,277 --> 00:16:46,509
-What?
-Helena says you must be awfully tired

166
00:16:46,542 --> 00:16:48,736
and not to make
any more effort today.

167
00:16:58,157 --> 00:17:00,718
Well done, Mama.

168
00:17:00,782 --> 00:17:04,980
-Doesn't Lena have a wristwatch?
I'll give you mine.

169
00:17:04,975 --> 00:17:07,204
It was a gift from an admirer

170
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:10,339
who said I was always late.

171
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:15,573
Will Lena be having dinner with us?
-No, she's on a diet.

172
00:17:16,304 --> 00:17:20,934
She ate far too much
at the hospital.

173
00:17:26,351 --> 00:17:28,183
Why do I feel like
I have a temperature?

174
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:30,922
Why do I want to cry?

175
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,303
I'm to be put to shame,
that's the idea.

176
00:17:37,265 --> 00:17:41,031
Then a guilty conscience.
Always a guilty conscience!

177
00:17:43,505 --> 00:17:47,442
I was in such a hurry to get here.
What was I expecting?

178
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:51,606
What was I longing
for so desperately?

179
00:17:52,626 --> 00:17:55,492
This extraordinary mother!

180
00:17:56,146 --> 00:18:00,208
You should have seen her
when I told her Lena was here.

181
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:04,613
She actually managed
to produce a smile

182
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:06,891
despite her surprise and alarm.

183
00:18:07,538 --> 00:18:12,771
And as we stood outside Lena's door:
an actress before her entrance,

184
00:18:12,723 --> 00:18:16,921
scared but in control.
The performance was superb.

185
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:20,692
Why on earth did she come here?

186
00:18:20,755 --> 00:18:25,591
What did she expect of a meeting
after 7 years? What did she expect?

187
00:18:25,555 --> 00:18:30,993
-I wonder.
-And what did I expect?
Does one never stop hoping?

188
00:18:30,931 --> 00:18:34,766
-I don't think so.
-Always mother and daughter!

189
00:18:35,284 --> 00:18:39,050
No use starting to cry.
Damn it!

190
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:43,307
There she sat, gazing
at me with her big eyes.

191
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:49,813
I held her face
and felt the disease

192
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:52,475
twitching at her
throat muscles.

193
00:18:54,068 --> 00:18:55,536
Damn it!

194
00:18:57,621 --> 00:19:00,284
To think I can't
carry her to my bed

195
00:19:00,342 --> 00:19:02,536
and comfort her as I did
when she was three.

196
00:19:10,293 --> 00:19:12,990
That soft, torn body

197
00:19:15,158 --> 00:19:16,786
that's my Lena!

198
00:19:21,847 --> 00:19:23,611
Don't cry, for Christ's sake.

199
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,572
A writer whose name
I've forgotten said,

200
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:30,543
" It's like a ghost
falling on top of you

201
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:33,348
"when you open the door
to the nursery

202
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,527
"having long since forgotten
it is the nursery."

203
00:19:37,817 --> 00:19:42,651
-Do you think I'm grown up?
-I guess being grown up is being able

204
00:19:42,617 --> 00:19:49,386
to handle your dreams and hopes. Not longing.
-Do you think so?

205
00:19:50,297 --> 00:19:52,493
Maybe you stop being surprised.

206
00:19:53,977 --> 00:19:58,039
How sensible you look,
with your old pipe.

207
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:03,205
-You're quite grown up.
-I wonder. I'm surprised every day.

208
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:06,131
-At what?
-At you.

209
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:10,936
And I have the most
unreasonable dreams and hopes.

210
00:20:10,906 --> 00:20:14,239
And a longing too, come to that.

211
00:20:14,266 --> 00:20:16,756
-Longing?
-Yes. I long for you.

212
00:20:17,306 --> 00:20:20,207
Those are very pretty words.

213
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:22,481
Words that don't
mean anything real.

214
00:20:23,227 --> 00:20:25,854
I was brought up
with beautiful words.

215
00:20:25,916 --> 00:20:30,443
Mama is never furious
or disappointed or unhappy

216
00:20:30,427 --> 00:20:34,557
she is "pained". You have
a lot of words like that too.

217
00:20:35,483 --> 00:20:37,951
It's a kind of
occupational disease.

218
00:20:38,909 --> 00:20:42,503
If you long for me
when I'm here,

219
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:45,789
I begin to be suspicious.
-You know what I mean.

220
00:20:45,821 --> 00:20:51,349
No. If I knew, it would
never enter your head to say so.

221
00:20:51,965 --> 00:20:55,365
I must see to the veal roast.

222
00:20:55,389 --> 00:20:59,154
Mama thinks I'm a hopeless cook.

223
00:20:59,165 --> 00:21:02,795
-Mama thinks you're a...
-...wonderful cook. Thank you!

224
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:07,502
And she's to have
decaffeinated coffee.

225
00:21:08,637 --> 00:21:13,631
I'll cut my visit short.
I can manage four days.

226
00:21:13,597 --> 00:21:16,158
Then I'll go to Africa
as I originally planned.

227
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:25,739
This hurts, Charlotte.
It hurts. Hurts. Hurts.

228
00:21:26,303 --> 00:21:31,798
I've often wondered why
she sleeps badly. Now I know.

229
00:21:31,744 --> 00:21:36,578
If that woman slept normally,
her vitality would crush everyone.

230
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:41,538
Her insomnia is nature's way
of using up the surplus energy.

231
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:48,259
I'll put on my red dress
just to spite Eva.

232
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:51,388
I'm sure she thinks
I ought to be in mourning.

233
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:56,470
See how carefully
she dresses for dinner.

234
00:21:56,448 --> 00:22:03,354
Her dress will be a discreet
reminder that she's a lonely widow.

235
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:11,016
I'm angry the whole time. Viktor
and Eva have been sweet to me.

236
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:16,375
Viktor's a kindly soul.
Lucky for Eva, the cry-baby.

237
00:22:16,322 --> 00:22:18,881
I don't suppose the shower works.

238
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,064
Yes, it does!

239
00:22:34,402 --> 00:22:38,170
-What a lovely dress!
-Does it suit me?

240
00:22:38,178 --> 00:22:42,137
One day I met
a friend who said,

241
00:22:42,148 --> 00:22:44,673
"I've just come
from a fashion show.

242
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:47,538
"There was a divine red dress
which is absolutely you!"

243
00:22:47,588 --> 00:22:51,751
To your health, Charlotte.
We're delighted to have you with us.

244
00:23:20,133 --> 00:23:23,330
Eva, see if I left
my glasses on the table.

245
00:23:32,326 --> 00:23:33,486
Thank you, darling.

246
00:24:37,099 --> 00:24:42,059
That was my agent, he's so sweet.
The only friend I have left.

247
00:24:42,026 --> 00:24:46,963
You remember him. Old Paul. We've
worked together now for 30 years.

248
00:24:47,979 --> 00:24:54,440
What a fine old instrument! What
a lovely tone! And just tuned.

249
00:24:54,348 --> 00:24:56,282
Now I'm really happy.

250
00:24:57,643 --> 00:25:00,669
I didn't need to worry.
-What do you mean, Mama?

251
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:04,776
I was nervous of seeing you
again after so many years.

252
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,181
I nearly didn't come.

253
00:25:07,244 --> 00:25:10,840
This peculiar coffee is a bore

254
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:12,656
but what can I do when
I can't sleep?

255
00:25:13,965 --> 00:25:16,831
I see you're working
on the Chopin preludes.

256
00:25:16,877 --> 00:25:19,607
Play something.
-Not now.

257
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:25,155
Don't be childish.
You'd give me great pleasure.

258
00:25:25,101 --> 00:25:28,902
But you wanted
your mother to hear you.

259
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:33,539
But it's all a sham.
I have no technique.

260
00:25:33,517 --> 00:25:38,420
I haven't even bothered
to learn the fingering.

261
00:25:38,383 --> 00:25:41,374
Darling, no more excuses.
Come on now, play.

262
00:27:31,285 --> 00:27:32,843
Eva, my dearest.

263
00:27:34,325 --> 00:27:37,454
-Is that all?
-I was just so moved.

264
00:27:38,517 --> 00:27:40,713
-Did you like it?
-I liked you.

265
00:27:41,782 --> 00:27:45,843
-I don't follow.
-Play something else.

266
00:27:45,845 --> 00:27:48,541
-What was wrong?
-Nothing.

267
00:27:49,302 --> 00:27:52,703
You didn't
like my interpretation.

268
00:27:52,727 --> 00:27:57,664
-We all have our own.
-Exactly. I want to know yours.

269
00:27:58,486 --> 00:28:04,653
-You're cross.
-No, I'm upset. You won't tell me your idea

270
00:28:04,567 --> 00:28:07,900
of this prelude.
-All right, if you insist.

271
00:28:09,207 --> 00:28:12,973
Your technique wasn't at all bad
though you might have taken

272
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:17,045
more interest
in Cortot's fingering.

273
00:28:17,049 --> 00:28:21,918
But let's just talk
about the conception.

274
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:26,854
Chopin was emotional,
but not mawkish.

275
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:29,809
Feeling is very far
from sentimentality.

276
00:28:29,848 --> 00:28:36,014
The prelude tells
of pain, not reverie.

277
00:28:35,929 --> 00:28:39,729
You have to be calm,
clear and harsh.

278
00:28:39,738 --> 00:28:41,638
Take the first bars now.

279
00:28:44,314 --> 00:28:47,476
It hurts, but
he doesn't show it.

280
00:28:48,761 --> 00:28:50,854
Then a short relief.

281
00:28:53,819 --> 00:28:58,313
But it evaporates at once,

282
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:00,630
and the pain is the same.

283
00:29:04,730 --> 00:29:07,198
Total restraint the whole time.

284
00:29:08,059 --> 00:29:12,119
Chopin was proud, passionate,

285
00:29:12,123 --> 00:29:17,357
tormented and very manly.
He wasn't a mawkish old woman.

286
00:29:17,308 --> 00:29:21,506
This prelude must be
made to sound almost ugly.

287
00:29:21,499 --> 00:29:24,731
It is never ingratiating.
It should sound wrong.

288
00:29:24,765 --> 00:29:28,223
You have to battle your way
through it and emerge triumphant.

289
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:31,657
Like this.

290
00:32:00,934 --> 00:32:02,162
I see.

291
00:32:04,391 --> 00:32:09,726
-Don't be cross with me.
-Why should I be? On the contrary.

292
00:32:09,671 --> 00:32:12,868
For 45 years I've worked
at these terrible preludes.

293
00:32:13,478 --> 00:32:17,472
They still contain a lot of secrets.

294
00:32:19,047 --> 00:32:21,674
When I was little,
I admired you enormously.

295
00:32:22,311 --> 00:32:25,337
Then I got pretty tired
of you and your pianos.

296
00:32:26,824 --> 00:32:30,054
Now I admire you again,
but in a different way.

297
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:33,975
-Then there's some hope.
-Yes, I guess so.

298
00:32:47,368 --> 00:32:50,861
-Where are you?
-I'm up here, Mama.

299
00:32:59,273 --> 00:33:03,073
I've changed, so we can go
for a walk if you like.

300
00:33:03,593 --> 00:33:06,825
-Is this the nursery?
-Yes, it's Erik's room.

301
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:13,471
-Fancy letting it stay like this!
-We've often talked of altering it.

302
00:33:13,418 --> 00:33:20,550
Sometimes I come and sit here
and let my thoughts wander.

303
00:33:20,426 --> 00:33:24,624
-Let's go.
-Wait, Mama! Feel the nice atmosphere in here.

304
00:33:27,596 --> 00:33:31,258
Erik drowned the day
before his fourth birthday.

305
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:32,868
But you know that.

306
00:33:33,452 --> 00:33:37,616
It was too much for Viktor.

307
00:33:37,611 --> 00:33:40,514
I grieved a lot, outwardly.

308
00:33:40,556 --> 00:33:43,855
Deep inside, I felt
he was still alive,

309
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:46,983
that we were living
close to each other.

310
00:33:48,331 --> 00:33:51,892
All I have to do is concentrate,
and he's there.

311
00:33:52,621 --> 00:33:58,526
Sometimes, as I'm falling asleep
I can feel him breathing on my face

312
00:33:58,445 --> 00:34:01,073
and touching me with his hand.

313
00:34:01,902 --> 00:34:05,633
He's living another life,
but we can reach one another.

314
00:34:05,645 --> 00:34:08,809
There's no dividing line,
no insurmountable wall.

315
00:34:10,029 --> 00:34:15,297
I wonder what the reality looks
like where my little boy is living.

316
00:34:15,246 --> 00:34:18,340
I know it can't be described.

317
00:34:18,382 --> 00:34:22,046
It's a world
of liberated feelings.

318
00:34:22,830 --> 00:34:24,321
Do you know what I mean?

319
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:28,754
To me, man is
a tremendous creation,

320
00:34:28,782 --> 00:34:31,717
an inconceivable thought.

321
00:34:31,758 --> 00:34:35,956
In man is everything,
from the highest to the lowest.

322
00:34:35,952 --> 00:34:40,114
Man is God's image,
and in God there is everything.

323
00:34:41,103 --> 00:34:46,632
So human beings are created,
but also the demons

324
00:34:46,575 --> 00:34:51,604
and the saints, the prophets
and artists and iconoclasts.

325
00:34:51,569 --> 00:34:54,629
Everything exists side by side.

326
00:34:54,673 --> 00:34:59,610
It's like huge patterns
changing all the time.

327
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:04,530
In the same way, there must
also be countless realities

328
00:35:04,497 --> 00:35:07,955
not only the reality
we perceive with our dull senses

329
00:35:07,985 --> 00:35:14,891
but a tumult of realities arching
above each other inside and outside.

330
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:18,932
It's just fear and
priggishness to believe in limits.

331
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:24,721
There are no limits.
Neither to thoughts

332
00:35:24,689 --> 00:35:26,418
nor to feelings.

333
00:35:27,795 --> 00:35:33,597
It's anxiety that sets limits.

334
00:35:33,522 --> 00:35:37,790
When you play the slow movement
of the Hammerklavier sonata

335
00:35:37,778 --> 00:35:43,080
you must feel you're living
in a world without limitations

336
00:35:43,028 --> 00:35:48,091
in an activity you can
never see through or explore.

337
00:35:50,035 --> 00:35:52,868
Let's go for a walk
before it gets too dark.

338
00:36:16,949 --> 00:36:20,750
I thought I heard Helena
calling. Excuse me.

339
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:27,851
I think Eva is awfully unhappy.

340
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:32,767
I'm appalled when I hear her
holding forth. It's so neurotic.

341
00:36:32,726 --> 00:36:35,662
Just a moment, Charlotte

342
00:36:35,702 --> 00:36:39,969
and I'll try to explain
how I view my wife.

343
00:36:42,232 --> 00:36:47,259
When I asked Eva to marry me,
she said she didn't love me.

344
00:36:47,223 --> 00:36:51,126
-What do you mean?
-I asked if she loved someone else.

345
00:36:51,736 --> 00:36:56,036
She said she had
never loved anyone,

346
00:36:56,023 --> 00:36:58,720
that she was
incapable of loving.

347
00:37:02,616 --> 00:37:09,919
Eva and I lived here for
several years. Then Erik was born.

348
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:16,628
We'd given up hope of a child of
our own and talked of adopting one.

349
00:37:16,537 --> 00:37:23,033
With her pregnancy, Eva
underwent a complete change.

350
00:37:22,937 --> 00:37:28,467
She became cheerful,
gentle and outgoing.

351
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:32,626
She got lazy and
couldn't be bothered

352
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:36,626
with her parish work
or her piano-playing.

353
00:37:36,635 --> 00:37:39,000
She would sit by that window
gazing at the play of light

354
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:42,229
over the fell and the fjord.

355
00:37:44,890 --> 00:37:46,949
We were suddenly very happy.

356
00:37:48,027 --> 00:37:51,520
I'm much older than Eva.

357
00:37:51,548 --> 00:37:54,984
I felt as if a gray film
were settling over life.

358
00:37:55,004 --> 00:38:00,101
I felt as if I could
look back and say,

359
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:03,895
"Well, well, so that was my life,
that's how it all turned out."

360
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:13,956
But suddenly things were different.

361
00:38:17,725 --> 00:38:23,685
Please forgive me, but
it's still rather hard to...

362
00:38:28,382 --> 00:38:35,116
Yes. We had some years
that were very rich. Erik.

363
00:38:38,943 --> 00:38:42,936
You should have seen Eva.

364
00:38:42,942 --> 00:38:46,036
At the time of Erik's birth

365
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:49,378
I was recording
all the Mozart sonatas.

366
00:38:49,406 --> 00:38:52,136
-I hadn't one day free.
-No.

367
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:55,091
We invited you
over and over again.

368
00:38:56,831 --> 00:39:00,461
When Erik drowned,
that gray film got even grayer.

369
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:05,702
For Eva it was different.

370
00:39:05,697 --> 00:39:11,601
-Different?
-Her feeling lives, uncorroded.

371
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,111
Or so it seems anyway.

372
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:22,250
If she feels that her son
is alive and near her,

373
00:39:23,104 --> 00:39:25,504
well, perhaps that's how it is.

374
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:29,235
She seldom speaks of it.

375
00:39:29,281 --> 00:39:31,682
I guess she's afraid
it might upset me

376
00:39:31,746 --> 00:39:33,406
as indeed it would.

377
00:39:34,593 --> 00:39:37,460
But what she says
sounds true enough.

378
00:39:38,721 --> 00:39:43,021
-I believe her.
-Yes, you're a minister.

379
00:39:43,617 --> 00:39:49,854
-My faith lives on her terms.
-I'm sorry if I hurt you.

380
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:53,596
It doesn't matter.
Unlike you and Eva,

381
00:39:53,604 --> 00:39:57,096
I'm diffuse and uncertain.
It's my own fault.

382
00:39:57,123 --> 00:40:00,751
I think I'll take a good dose
of sleeping pills tonight.

383
00:40:04,995 --> 00:40:09,023
It's so peaceful here, only
the hiss of the rain on the roof.

384
00:40:09,988 --> 00:40:13,219
-Do you have all you need?
-Couldn't be better.

385
00:40:13,253 --> 00:40:17,246
Cookies and mineral water,
tape recorder,

386
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:20,950
two detective novels,
my blindfold and ear-plugs

387
00:40:20,964 --> 00:40:24,127
and my travel blanket.

388
00:40:24,165 --> 00:40:27,623
Like to taste my
delicious Swiss chocolate?

389
00:40:27,654 --> 00:40:32,282
-You can have two pieces.
-I don't like chocolate.

390
00:40:32,261 --> 00:40:36,061
I seem to remember you were
crazy about candy as a child.

391
00:40:36,677 --> 00:40:41,911
-Helena liked it. I didn't.
-Good, all the more for me.

392
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:44,525
-Good night, Mama.
-Good night, my pet.

393
00:40:44,582 --> 00:40:49,144
Viktor is a delightful person.
You must take care of him.

394
00:40:49,126 --> 00:40:54,997
-I do.
-Are you happy together?

395
00:40:54,918 --> 00:40:58,376
Do you get on well?
-Viktor is my best friend.

396
00:40:58,406 --> 00:41:01,205
I can't imagine life without him.

397
00:41:02,151 --> 00:41:06,212
-He said you didn't love him.
-Did he say that?

398
00:41:06,216 --> 00:41:10,982
-Yes. Why?
-Oh,just rather surprising.

399
00:41:10,952 --> 00:41:12,578
Was it a secret?

400
00:41:14,056 --> 00:41:18,254
But he shouldn't have said it?
-He's not the confiding sort.

401
00:41:18,247 --> 00:41:23,151
-We were talking about you.
-If you want to know anything, ask me.

402
00:41:23,112 --> 00:41:27,343
I'll answer truthfully.
-Now, don't get upset.

403
00:41:27,337 --> 00:41:31,501
A mother naturally worries
about her daughter.

404
00:41:31,496 --> 00:41:35,729
We spoke of you with
the greatest affection.

405
00:41:35,721 --> 00:41:39,385
If only you'd leave people alone!

406
00:41:39,402 --> 00:41:42,530
I've left you alone far too long.

407
00:41:42,570 --> 00:41:47,803
-You're right.
-Give me a hug. Promise you're not angry.

408
00:41:47,753 --> 00:41:50,348
-I'm not.
-I love you, don't you see.

409
00:41:50,409 --> 00:41:51,774
I love you too.

410
00:41:52,937 --> 00:41:56,032
It's not much fun
being alone always.

411
00:41:57,034 --> 00:41:59,060
I envy you and Viktor.

412
00:41:59,818 --> 00:42:05,314
Now that Leonardo's dead,
I'm so awfully lonely.

413
00:42:05,259 --> 00:42:07,887
Don't you see?
-Yes.

414
00:42:07,948 --> 00:42:11,713
I'll begin to weep with
self-pity in a minute.

415
00:42:11,724 --> 00:42:14,487
This book isn't at all bad.

416
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:17,873
It's by Adam Kretzinsky.
Have you heard of him?

417
00:42:18,348 --> 00:42:21,874
I met him in Madrid.
Mad as a hatter.

418
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:25,063
I couldn't defend myself.
In fact, I didn't.

419
00:42:25,901 --> 00:42:29,735
-Shall I put out this light?
-Yes, please.

420
00:42:31,564 --> 00:42:34,692
-I'll bring your breakfast.
-Don't trouble yourself.

421
00:42:34,733 --> 00:42:38,294
-But I want to spoil you.
-Very well, if you insist.

422
00:42:39,086 --> 00:42:43,488
Strong coffee, hot milk, two
slices of German bread with cheese,

423
00:42:43,469 --> 00:42:48,031
one slice of toast with honey.

424
00:42:48,013 --> 00:42:50,846
-And orange juice.
-I nearly forgot.

425
00:42:50,893 --> 00:42:53,088
I can...
-Juice it will be.

426
00:42:53,166 --> 00:42:56,396
Good night, darling.
-Good night, Mama.

427
00:43:19,087 --> 00:43:22,080
I think I'll have
a look at my accounts.

428
00:43:22,863 --> 00:43:26,424
I'll have Brammer invest
the money from Leonardo.

429
00:43:28,304 --> 00:43:31,273
The house is worth
quite a bit too.

430
00:43:31,312 --> 00:43:34,749
You never bothered about money.

431
00:43:34,768 --> 00:43:36,793
You were above mundane worries

432
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:40,367
and left all problems
to your Charlotte.

433
00:43:41,842 --> 00:43:48,611
3,735,866 francs.

434
00:43:50,417 --> 00:43:53,853
To think you had so much money.
Who'd have thought it?

435
00:43:56,658 --> 00:43:59,718
And you leave it all
to your old Charlotte.

436
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:04,813
I've got a little nest egg, too.

437
00:44:07,155 --> 00:44:10,124
Together, it comes
to over five million.

438
00:44:11,091 --> 00:44:12,820
What am I going to do
with so much money?

439
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,647
I'll buy a nice car
for Viktor and Eva.

440
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:21,678
They can't drive around
in that old rattle-trap.

441
00:44:21,684 --> 00:44:24,744
On Monday we'll go into
town and look at a new car.

442
00:44:25,171 --> 00:44:30,337
It'll cheer them up.
Me too.

443
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:35,160
"She offered him the red flower
of her virginity.

444
00:44:35,123 --> 00:44:37,853
" He accepted it
without enthusiasm..."

445
00:44:40,437 --> 00:44:44,134
What trash!

446
00:44:44,981 --> 00:44:49,007
Adam was quite
an idiot, he was,

447
00:44:49,012 --> 00:44:51,981
even if he did nearly commit
suicide because of me.

448
00:44:55,958 --> 00:45:00,554
Supposing I buy a new car for
myself and give them the Mercedes?

449
00:45:00,886 --> 00:45:05,084
Then I can fly to Paris

450
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:11,073
and buy a car there and
won't have to drive all that way.

451
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:14,445
Tomorrow, I must get
down to Ravel.

452
00:45:15,031 --> 00:45:20,594
It's disgraceful
how lazy I've been of late.

453
00:46:15,866 --> 00:46:18,334
Mama, what's happened?

454
00:46:18,906 --> 00:46:22,570
I heard you call out,
and you were not in your room.

455
00:46:22,587 --> 00:46:27,786
I'm sorry to wake you, but
I had such a horrible dream...

456
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:32,279
I can't remember it.
-Shall I keep you company?

457
00:46:32,283 --> 00:46:37,243
No thank you, dear.
You go back to bed.

458
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,474
Very well.

459
00:46:42,076 --> 00:46:45,205
-You do like me, don't you?
-You are my mother.

460
00:46:46,525 --> 00:46:48,254
That's one way of answering.

461
00:46:58,206 --> 00:47:01,106
-Do you like me?
-I love you.

462
00:47:01,148 --> 00:47:02,776
Do you?

463
00:47:03,324 --> 00:47:07,920
I broke off my career to
stay at home with you and Papa.

464
00:47:07,901 --> 00:47:13,239
Your back prevented you from
practicing six hours a day.

465
00:47:13,182 --> 00:47:17,811
Your playing got worse
and so did your reviews.

466
00:47:17,790 --> 00:47:21,192
Have you forgotten it?
-No, but Eva...

467
00:47:21,215 --> 00:47:23,445
I don't know which I hated more

468
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:26,316
when you were at home
or when you were on tour.

469
00:47:27,295 --> 00:47:31,163
I realize now you made
life hell for Papa and me.

470
00:47:31,166 --> 00:47:34,158
Your father and I
were very happy.

471
00:47:34,207 --> 00:47:37,575
I'd have done anything for him.

472
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:43,402
-You were unfaithful to him.
-I was not!

473
00:47:43,328 --> 00:47:46,457
I was quite honest with Josef.

474
00:47:46,495 --> 00:47:49,430
I fell in love with Martin
and lived with him for 8 months.

475
00:47:50,848 --> 00:47:56,912
It wasn't a bed of roses.
-It was I who had to sit with Papa in the evenings.

476
00:47:56,832 --> 00:48:02,863
It was I who had to comfort him to
keep repeating that you did love him

477
00:48:02,785 --> 00:48:05,515
just the same, that
you were sure to come back.

478
00:48:07,232 --> 00:48:10,896
I read your letters out loud.

479
00:48:10,913 --> 00:48:15,374
Your long, loving, amusing
letters in which you told us

480
00:48:15,363 --> 00:48:17,456
of your interesting travels.

481
00:48:19,042 --> 00:48:23,446
We sat there like two idiots
reading your letters

482
00:48:23,427 --> 00:48:28,125
over and over. We thought a more
wonderful person didn't exist.

483
00:48:29,219 --> 00:48:33,212
You hate me.

484
00:48:38,114 --> 00:48:44,815
I don't know. I looked forward
so much to your coming.

485
00:48:44,707 --> 00:48:46,698
I don't know what
I was imagining.

486
00:48:47,812 --> 00:48:50,804
Maybe I thought you
were lonely and sad.

487
00:48:51,268 --> 00:48:53,361
I'm so confused.

488
00:48:54,245 --> 00:48:58,874
I thought I was grown up and
could look clearly at you and me

489
00:48:58,853 --> 00:49:01,219
and Helena's illness
and our childhood.

490
00:49:03,909 --> 00:49:06,377
Now it's all one big muddle.

491
00:49:24,613 --> 00:49:28,447
It's all right now.
Wake up.

492
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:41,812
I'll sit here with you
until you go to sleep.

493
00:50:45,546 --> 00:50:49,607
To you, I was a doll you played
with when you had time.

494
00:50:51,307 --> 00:50:55,675
If I was sick or naughty, you
handed me overtoyour nursemaid.

495
00:50:57,483 --> 00:51:00,611
You shutyourself
in and worked,

496
00:51:00,651 --> 00:51:02,449
andno one was
allowed to disturb you.

497
00:51:03,308 --> 00:51:05,538
I used to stand outside,
listening.

498
00:51:06,412 --> 00:51:10,974
When you'd stop for coffee, I'd
go in to see ifyou really existed.

499
00:51:11,885 --> 00:51:15,786
You were always kind,
butyour mind was elsewhere.

500
00:51:17,005 --> 00:51:19,633
If I spoke, you'd hardly answer.

501
00:51:21,101 --> 00:51:22,569
Thank you.

502
00:51:41,711 --> 00:51:43,837
Mama wants to be left alone now.

503
00:51:43,919 --> 00:51:46,079
Run along and play outside.
It's such a lovely day.

504
00:52:01,743 --> 00:52:04,337
You always looked so nice,
so I wanted to be nice.

505
00:52:05,391 --> 00:52:10,295
I always worried that you
wouldn't like my appearance.

506
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:15,934
I was so ugly. Lean and
angular with big cow's eyes,

507
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:21,825
and big wide lips
andno eyebrows.

508
00:52:21,745 --> 00:52:25,273
My arms were too thin
and my feet too big.

509
00:52:25,297 --> 00:52:27,491
No, I thought
I looked repulsive.

510
00:52:28,976 --> 00:52:33,436
Once you said:
"You should have been a boy, "

511
00:52:33,425 --> 00:52:36,953
and laughed so
I wouldn't be upset.

512
00:52:36,978 --> 00:52:43,348
I was, of course. Then one day your
suitcases would be downstairs

513
00:52:43,251 --> 00:52:47,152
and you'd be talking on the
phone in a foreign language.

514
00:52:48,019 --> 00:52:52,285
I used to pray that something
would stop you from going,

515
00:52:53,394 --> 00:52:55,056
butyou always went.

516
00:52:56,148 --> 00:53:00,107
You'd putyour arms
around me and kiss me

517
00:53:00,115 --> 00:53:05,450
and look at me and smile.

518
00:53:05,395 --> 00:53:08,923
You smelled
nice but strange.

519
00:53:08,948 --> 00:53:13,577
You yourself were a stranger, already
on your way. You didn't see me.

520
00:53:15,315 --> 00:53:21,551
Then you'd be gone.
I used to think, "Now I'll die,

521
00:53:21,557 --> 00:53:25,357
"it hurts so much.
I'll never be happy again.

522
00:53:26,293 --> 00:53:30,457
"How can I bear such
pain for two months?"

523
00:53:40,949 --> 00:53:45,580
And I'd cry In Papa's lap.
He'd sit quite still

524
00:53:45,558 --> 00:53:48,891
with his soft hand on my head.

525
00:53:48,918 --> 00:53:54,220
He'd go on and on sitting
there smoking his old pipe.

526
00:53:55,063 --> 00:54:00,729
Sometimes he'd say, "Let's go
to a movie this evening, "or

527
00:54:00,663 --> 00:54:02,858
"What about ice cream
for dinner today? "

528
00:54:04,759 --> 00:54:08,161
But all I wanted was to die.

529
00:54:12,249 --> 00:54:15,774
So the days and weeks passed.

530
00:54:15,993 --> 00:54:18,484
We shared the
loneliness quite well.

531
00:54:19,801 --> 00:54:21,894
We didn't have much to say

532
00:54:21,977 --> 00:54:24,810
but I never disturbed him.

533
00:54:26,360 --> 00:54:28,590
Sometimes he'd look worried.
I didn't know then

534
00:54:28,664 --> 00:54:33,329
that he was always short of money.
But whenever I'd come

535
00:54:33,304 --> 00:54:37,140
clumping along, his
face would brighten,

536
00:54:37,146 --> 00:54:41,207
and he'd pat me
with his pale little hand.

537
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:48,030
Or else Uncle Otto would be sitting
on the sofa, drinking brandy.

538
00:54:48,089 --> 00:54:50,649
They'd mumble to each other.

539
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:53,200
I wonder if they heard
what they said.

540
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:57,925
Or else Uncle Harry would be
there and they'd play chess,

541
00:54:59,226 --> 00:55:02,684
and then it'd be extra quiet.

542
00:55:03,899 --> 00:55:07,630
I could hear three
different clocks ticking.

543
00:55:11,386 --> 00:55:13,616
A few days before
you were due home

544
00:55:14,332 --> 00:55:17,095
I'd get a temperature
from the excitement.

545
00:55:17,148 --> 00:55:20,083
I'd worry I might
really get sick,

546
00:55:20,124 --> 00:55:22,251
because you were
afraid of sick people.

547
00:55:24,283 --> 00:55:28,344
When you did come,
I was so happy

548
00:55:28,348 --> 00:55:33,480
I couldn't say anything.
You'd get impatient and say,

549
00:55:33,436 --> 00:55:37,167
"Eva doesn't seem very pleased
to have her mother home again. "

550
00:55:38,301 --> 00:55:43,762
I'd blush red as a beet
and break out in a sweat.

551
00:55:43,964 --> 00:55:48,493
I couldn't say anything,
I had no words.

552
00:55:49,726 --> 00:55:53,888
You had taken charge
of all the words in our home.

553
00:55:53,885 --> 00:55:57,616
-You're exaggerating.
-I must finish speaking.

554
00:55:57,631 --> 00:56:02,760
I know I'm tipsy but otherwise
I wouldn't have said what I have.

555
00:56:02,718 --> 00:56:06,712
When I don't dare say any more
because I'm ashamed

556
00:56:06,719 --> 00:56:11,952
you can explain and
I'll listen and understand

557
00:56:11,904 --> 00:56:13,598
just as I've always done.

558
00:56:18,208 --> 00:56:22,576
I loved you, Mama, it was
a matter of life and death.

559
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:25,085
But I distrusted your words.

560
00:56:25,664 --> 00:56:28,394
They didn't match
the expression in your eyes.

561
00:56:29,569 --> 00:56:31,537
You have a beautiful voice.
When I was little,

562
00:56:31,616 --> 00:56:35,052
I could feel it all over my body.

563
00:56:35,073 --> 00:56:39,032
But I knew instinctively
you didn't mean what you said.

564
00:56:41,250 --> 00:56:43,343
I couldn't understand your words.

565
00:56:46,114 --> 00:56:49,845
The most horrible thing was,
you'd smile when you were mad.

566
00:56:50,370 --> 00:56:53,066
When you hated Papa
you'd call him

567
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:58,184
"my dearest." When you
were tired of me you'd say

568
00:56:58,145 --> 00:57:00,205
"darling little girl."

569
00:57:16,035 --> 00:57:17,365
How quiet.

570
00:57:19,586 --> 00:57:21,020
What am I to say?

571
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,436
-Defend yourself.
-Is it worth while?

572
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:32,311
-How do I know?
-You reproach me for going away

573
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,020
and for staying at home.

574
00:57:35,429 --> 00:57:39,296
I had a hell of
a time those years.

575
00:57:41,061 --> 00:57:47,693
My back hurt, I couldn't practice.
Important engagements were cancelled.

576
00:57:47,588 --> 00:57:50,421
My life seemed meaningless.

577
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:55,169
I had a guilty conscience about
always being away from you and Papa.

578
00:57:56,100 --> 00:58:01,163
You smile sarcastically.
I'm trying to speak truthfully.

579
00:58:01,222 --> 00:58:04,453
I'm merely
telling you how I felt.

580
00:58:05,158 --> 00:58:08,320
We may as well have this out for
once then we won't refer to it again.

581
00:58:11,655 --> 00:58:13,315
Go on.

582
00:58:18,150 --> 00:58:22,109
I was in Hamburg,
playing Beethoven's First.

583
00:58:22,119 --> 00:58:26,920
It's not too difficult,
and everything had gone well.

584
00:58:26,888 --> 00:58:30,186
After the concert I went out to
supper with Schmiess, the conductor.

585
00:58:30,216 --> 00:58:35,208
We always did. When we'd been
eating and drinking for a while

586
00:58:35,175 --> 00:58:39,236
and I was content
and relaxed

587
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:43,802
and my back wasn't aching,
Schmiess said,

588
00:58:46,441 --> 00:58:49,068
"Why don't you stay
at home with your husband

589
00:58:49,129 --> 00:58:53,030
"and child and lead
a respectable life,

590
00:58:53,482 --> 00:58:57,008
"instead of laying yourself
open to constant humiliation?"

591
00:59:00,330 --> 00:59:04,994
I stared at him
and laughed and said,

592
00:59:04,969 --> 00:59:09,431
" Did I play so badly?"
" No," he said

593
00:59:09,418 --> 00:59:16,449
"but I can't help
thinking of August 18, 1934.

594
00:59:18,731 --> 00:59:23,099
"We played Beethoven's First
together in Linz.

595
00:59:23,818 --> 00:59:27,652
"You were twenty years old,
the hall was packed,

596
00:59:27,658 --> 00:59:30,821
"we played like gods,
the orchestra was inspired.

597
00:59:31,851 --> 00:59:35,720
"Afterwards, the audience
stood up and cheered

598
00:59:35,724 --> 00:59:37,351
"and the orchestra
gave a fanfare."

599
00:59:42,316 --> 00:59:46,342
Then he said "You had a
simple red summer dress

600
00:59:46,348 --> 00:59:48,283
"and long hair to your waist."

601
00:59:51,084 --> 00:59:53,713
" How do you remember all that?"
I asked.

602
00:59:54,957 --> 00:59:57,653
"I wrote it down
in my score," he said.

603
00:59:58,574 --> 01:00:01,599
"I make a note of all
my great experiences."

604
01:00:04,686 --> 01:00:07,347
When I got back to the
hotel, I couldn't sleep.

605
01:00:08,846 --> 01:00:11,336
At three in the
morning I phoned Josef

606
01:00:11,406 --> 01:00:14,739
and told him I was
going to stop touring,

607
01:00:15,629 --> 01:00:19,497
and stay at home with him and you.
We'd be a real family.

608
01:00:23,727 --> 01:00:26,321
Josef was awfully happy.

609
01:00:27,438 --> 01:00:29,565
We wept with emotion,
both of us,

610
01:00:31,312 --> 01:00:33,211
and talked for two hours.

611
01:00:33,872 --> 01:00:37,362
And that was that.
That summer

612
01:00:37,390 --> 01:00:40,053
we were happy.
Weren't we?

613
01:00:45,617 --> 01:00:48,278
You weren't happy?
-No.

614
01:00:48,337 --> 01:00:50,464
You said things had
never been so good.

615
01:00:54,481 --> 01:00:56,449
I said it to please you.

616
01:01:01,937 --> 01:01:08,000
That just goes to show.
What did I do wrong?

617
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,118
I was fourteen and you directed
the whole of your

618
01:01:12,114 --> 01:01:14,673
pent-up energy against me.

619
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:18,291
You were damn well
going to make up

620
01:01:18,354 --> 01:01:20,880
for your neglect.

621
01:01:20,946 --> 01:01:23,915
I tried to defend myself,
but I didn't' have a chance.

622
01:01:23,955 --> 01:01:29,448
You trotted out your thoughtfulness
and your worried voice.

623
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:34,890
There wasn't one detail that escaped
your loving energy.

624
01:01:35,154 --> 01:01:38,852
I had a stoop.
You got to work with gymnastics.

625
01:01:38,868 --> 01:01:42,702
We did exercises together.

626
01:01:42,707 --> 01:01:46,269
You thought my hair
was too long,

627
01:01:46,292 --> 01:01:49,658
so you had it cut short.
It was hideous.

628
01:01:49,940 --> 01:01:52,704
Then you got the idea
my teeth were crooked

629
01:01:52,757 --> 01:01:56,123
so I got braces.
I looked grotesque.

630
01:01:56,148 --> 01:01:59,277
You said I couldn't go
around in pants any longer

631
01:01:59,316 --> 01:02:04,277
so you had dresses made
without asking what I thought.

632
01:02:04,246 --> 01:02:08,580
I didn't dare say no because
I didn't want to upset you.

633
01:02:09,972 --> 01:02:13,965
You brought along books for me

634
01:02:13,974 --> 01:02:17,875
which I didn't understand.
I read and read, then you

635
01:02:17,877 --> 01:02:21,905
and I had to discuss it. You'd hold
forth and my mind was a blank.

636
01:02:21,910 --> 01:02:25,140
I was scared you'd expose

637
01:02:25,174 --> 01:02:28,472
my stupidity.

638
01:02:28,503 --> 01:02:32,667
But one thing I did
Understand: not a shred

639
01:02:32,662 --> 01:02:37,099
of the real me could be
loved or accepted.

640
01:02:37,078 --> 01:02:41,846
You were obsessed and I grew more
and more afraid and annihilated.

641
01:02:41,814 --> 01:02:46,218
I said what you wanted me
to say and made your gestures.

642
01:02:46,198 --> 01:02:49,326
I didn't dare to be myself
even when I was alone

643
01:02:49,367 --> 01:02:53,998
because I hated
what was my own.

644
01:02:55,288 --> 01:03:01,193
It was horrible, Mama!
I still shake all over

645
01:03:01,113 --> 01:03:05,708
when I think of those years.
It was horrible.

646
01:03:09,529 --> 01:03:15,366
I didn't realize I hated you as I
was quite sure we loved each other.

647
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:20,745
I couldn't hate you, so my hatred
turned into an insane fear.

648
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:23,689
I had nightmares.

649
01:03:23,737 --> 01:03:26,035
I bit my nails.

650
01:03:27,067 --> 01:03:30,593
I pulled out tufts of hair.

651
01:03:30,617 --> 01:03:34,384
I tried to scream but could
only make stifled grunts.

652
01:03:34,393 --> 01:03:36,794
That frightened me even more

653
01:03:36,859 --> 01:03:40,420
as I thought I was
going out of my mind.

654
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,179
Then came Stefan.
-And made you pregnant.

655
01:03:57,243 --> 01:04:02,203
I was 18. Stefan was grown-up.
We could have managed.

656
01:04:02,173 --> 01:04:07,770
-No!
-We wanted to have the child
butyou spoiled everything.

657
01:04:07,708 --> 01:04:10,505
That's not true!
I said to Papa

658
01:04:10,589 --> 01:04:16,459
we should wait and see. You didn't
realize Stefan was an idiot.

659
01:04:16,382 --> 01:04:21,046
Were you present at our discussions?

660
01:04:21,021 --> 01:04:26,584
Were you lurking under our bed?

661
01:04:26,525 --> 01:04:31,588
Have you ever given a damn about
any living soul except yourself?

662
01:04:31,549 --> 01:04:35,007
I didn't force you into an abortion.

663
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:40,202
How could I defy you?
I was afraid and needed help.

664
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:44,185
I tried to help you.
I thought abortion was the only way.

665
01:04:44,190 --> 01:04:49,788
I've thought so all along.
All this hatred!

666
01:04:49,728 --> 01:04:53,061
Why have you never said anything?
-Because you never listen.

667
01:04:53,087 --> 01:04:58,581
You're a goddamn escapist.
You're emotionally crippled.

668
01:04:58,526 --> 01:05:01,895
In actual fact
you detest me and Helena.

669
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:04,683
You're shut up inside yourself

670
01:05:04,737 --> 01:05:07,672
and always stand in your own light.

671
01:05:07,873 --> 01:05:10,239
I loved you,
but you thought I was disgusting

672
01:05:11,104 --> 01:05:16,372
and stupid and a failure.

673
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:19,153
You managed to
injure me for life,

674
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:22,135
just as you are injured.

675
01:05:22,176 --> 01:05:25,476
All that was sensitive
and delicate, you attacked.

676
01:05:25,506 --> 01:05:28,872
All that was alive,
you tried to smother.

677
01:05:42,274 --> 01:05:44,436
You talk of my hatred.

678
01:05:46,754 --> 01:05:49,086
Your hatred was no less.

679
01:05:53,443 --> 01:05:55,673
Your hatred is no less.

680
01:05:57,892 --> 01:06:03,523
I was little and malleable and loving.

681
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:07,089
You bound me because you wanted my love

682
01:06:07,108 --> 01:06:11,840
just as you want everyone else's love.

683
01:06:11,811 --> 01:06:14,245
I was utterly at your mercy.

684
01:06:16,388 --> 01:06:19,880
It was all done
in the name of love.

685
01:06:20,164 --> 01:06:24,067
You kept saying you loved me
and Papa and Helena.

686
01:06:24,933 --> 01:06:28,528
And you were an expert at love's
intonations and gestures.

687
01:06:32,068 --> 01:06:34,503
People like you are a menace.

688
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,488
You should be locked away
and rendered harmless.

689
01:06:56,742 --> 01:06:58,369
A mother and a daughter.

690
01:07:04,647 --> 01:07:09,050
What a terrible combination

691
01:07:09,639 --> 01:07:14,771
of feelings and
confusion and destruction.

692
01:07:16,457 --> 01:07:21,222
Everything is possible and is done
in the name of love and solicitude.

693
01:07:24,137 --> 01:07:28,506
The mother's injuries are to
be handed down to the daughter.

694
01:07:30,345 --> 01:07:33,711
The mother's failures are to
be paid for by the daughter.

695
01:07:35,977 --> 01:07:40,174
The mother's unhappiness is
to be the daughter's unhappiness.

696
01:07:41,834 --> 01:07:45,668
It's as if the umbilical cord
had never been cut.

697
01:07:48,747 --> 01:07:53,150
Is it so?

698
01:07:55,979 --> 01:07:58,947
Is the daughter's misfortune
the mother's triumph?

699
01:08:06,636 --> 01:08:12,164
Is my grief your secret pleasure?

700
01:09:03,663 --> 01:09:06,928
My back's aching.

701
01:09:08,687 --> 01:09:10,679
Do you mind
If I lie on the floor,

702
01:09:12,398 --> 01:09:14,163
it's the only
thing that helps.

703
01:09:17,999 --> 01:09:20,400
I remember very little of my childhood.

704
01:09:21,711 --> 01:09:25,477
I can't recall my parents
ever having touched me,

705
01:09:25,872 --> 01:09:29,274
either with caresses or punishments.

706
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:34,916
I was quite ignorant
of everything to do with love:

707
01:09:34,896 --> 01:09:39,833
tenderness, contact,
intimacy, warmth.

708
01:09:43,088 --> 01:09:48,424
Only through music did I have
a chance to show my feelings.

709
01:09:51,344 --> 01:09:53,746
Sometimes, when
I lie awake at night

710
01:09:55,377 --> 01:09:58,348
I wonder whether
I've lived at all.

711
01:10:00,273 --> 01:10:03,208
Is it the same for everybody?

712
01:10:03,954 --> 01:10:08,688
Or do some people have a greater
talent for living than others.

713
01:10:09,106 --> 01:10:13,009
Or do some people never live

714
01:10:14,482 --> 01:10:16,475
but just exist?

715
01:10:20,084 --> 01:10:26,454
Then I'm seized by fear.

716
01:10:27,124 --> 01:10:29,920
I'm seized by fear and see
a horrible picture of myself.

717
01:10:30,997 --> 01:10:33,259
I have never grown up.

718
01:10:33,877 --> 01:10:36,812
My face and my body have aged.

719
01:10:39,125 --> 01:10:41,718
I acquire memories and experiences,

720
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:47,572
but inside all that
I haven't even been born.

721
01:10:50,742 --> 01:10:53,039
I can't remember any faces

722
01:10:54,708 --> 01:10:56,471
not even my own.

723
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:02,685
Sometimes, I try to recall
my mother's face

724
01:11:03,733 --> 01:11:10,230
but I can't see her. I know she was
big and dark and had blue eyes,

725
01:11:10,325 --> 01:11:14,319
a large nose and full lips.

726
01:11:15,191 --> 01:11:18,284
But I can't fit the various bits together.

727
01:11:22,007 --> 01:11:24,567
I can't see her. In the same way,

728
01:11:24,631 --> 01:11:28,964
I can't see your face
or Helena's or Leonardo's.

729
01:11:29,144 --> 01:11:31,977
I remember giving birth
To you and your sister but

730
01:11:32,024 --> 01:11:38,155
all I know of the deliveries
is that they hurt.

731
01:11:39,704 --> 01:11:43,162
But the pain?
What was that like?

732
01:11:45,239 --> 01:11:47,173
I don't remember.

733
01:11:50,778 --> 01:11:52,607
Leonardo once said that...

734
01:11:54,137 --> 01:11:57,265
how did he put it now...

735
01:11:57,754 --> 01:12:02,384
"A sense of reality
is a matter of talent.

736
01:12:03,450 --> 01:12:09,514
" Most people lack that talent
and maybe it's just as well."

737
01:12:11,513 --> 01:12:16,213
Do you know what he meant?
-Yes, I do.

738
01:12:19,036 --> 01:12:22,699
How very strange.
-Strange?

739
01:12:24,092 --> 01:12:28,687
I've always been afraid of you.
-I can't understand that.

740
01:12:28,731 --> 01:12:32,531
I think I wanted you
to take care of me.

741
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:37,128
To put your arms around me
and comfort me.

742
01:12:38,011 --> 01:12:39,604
I was a child.

743
01:12:43,452 --> 01:12:46,080
Does that matter?
-No.

744
01:12:46,716 --> 01:12:48,776
I saw you loved me

745
01:12:49,979 --> 01:12:52,039
and I wanted to love you, but

746
01:12:52,893 --> 01:12:56,954
I was afraid of your demands.

747
01:12:58,781 --> 01:13:02,774
-I didn't have any.
-I thought you did.

748
01:13:04,894 --> 01:13:06,986
I didn't want to be your mother.

749
01:13:08,477 --> 01:13:11,743
I wanted you to know I was
as helpless as you were.

750
01:13:13,469 --> 01:13:15,028
Is that really true?

751
01:13:33,664 --> 01:13:37,100
-What are you thinking about?
-Leonardo and Helena.

752
01:13:38,591 --> 01:13:39,854
I don't understand.

753
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,015
Why, they hardly knew each other.

754
01:13:44,863 --> 01:13:50,234
We were together on Bornholm one Easter.
-You left after 3 days.

755
01:13:50,176 --> 01:13:53,407
I was to play Bartok's First in Geneva.

756
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:58,344
I wanted to go through the concerto
with the conductor in peace an quiet.

757
01:13:59,265 --> 01:14:02,530
So it's possible I did leave earlier.

758
01:14:02,658 --> 01:14:07,425
The weather was hideous. Leonardo
was in a bad mood. So were you.

759
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:13,526
Why make me remember it all?

760
01:14:13,570 --> 01:14:15,197
I'll tell you.

761
01:14:16,673 --> 01:14:20,872
You arrived on Thursday.
That evening we laughed

762
01:14:20,866 --> 01:14:23,892
and sang and drank wine and played

763
01:14:23,939 --> 01:14:26,271
some old game we found.

764
01:14:26,946 --> 01:14:29,574
Helena wasn't so ill then.
She was

765
01:14:29,635 --> 01:14:31,727
happy all evening.

766
01:14:32,642 --> 01:14:34,803
Leonardo was happy
because she was.

767
01:14:34,883 --> 01:14:38,512
He talked and joked with her.

768
01:14:39,874 --> 01:14:42,604
She fell head over heels in love.

769
01:14:43,236 --> 01:14:45,897
They sat together
until late at night.

770
01:14:47,172 --> 01:14:52,871
Next day Helena told me
he had kissed her.

771
01:15:01,348 --> 01:15:03,315
In the evening we had guests.

772
01:15:04,485 --> 01:15:09,717
Leonardo drank too much
and played all the Bach solo suites.

773
01:15:11,078 --> 01:15:14,103
He was quite unlike himself,

774
01:15:14,150 --> 01:15:16,880
heavy and gentle
and as if enlarged.

775
01:15:18,437 --> 01:15:22,033
He played badly
but beautifully.

776
01:15:23,750 --> 01:15:26,948
Helena sat there
in the dusk, beaming.

777
01:15:26,982 --> 01:15:28,881
I've never seen
anything like it.

778
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:25,739
You and I went for a walk.
You chattered away.

779
01:16:25,737 --> 01:16:29,605
I didn't really listen.
I was thinking of those two.

780
01:16:32,298 --> 01:16:37,200
When we got home, they
were sitting as we'd left them.

781
01:16:37,162 --> 01:16:43,726
You went off to bed and
I had to help Leonardo upstairs.

782
01:16:44,875 --> 01:16:47,605
Outside the door of the bedroom

783
01:16:47,659 --> 01:16:51,651
he stopped, looked
at me and said,

784
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:57,105
"Can you imagine?
There's a butterfly

785
01:16:57,132 --> 01:17:00,363
"fluttering against the window."

786
01:17:02,028 --> 01:17:07,193
When I went back to Helena,
she was sitting

787
01:17:07,149 --> 01:17:10,812
bolt upright, quite relaxed and calm.

788
01:17:11,788 --> 01:17:16,623
There wasn't a trace
of her illness.

789
01:17:20,494 --> 01:17:22,826
I'll never forget her face, Mama.

790
01:17:27,246 --> 01:17:29,713
I'll never forget her face.

791
01:17:34,030 --> 01:17:36,329
Next morning you left for Geneva,

792
01:17:37,581 --> 01:17:40,914
four days earlier
than we had agreed.

793
01:17:41,998 --> 01:17:45,560
You said casually on
Leaving," I've asked Leonardo

794
01:17:45,582 --> 01:17:49,746
"to stay, as I see it's
doing Helena good."

795
01:17:49,744 --> 01:17:51,710
And you smiled.

796
01:17:53,680 --> 01:17:57,671
Leonardo abruptly became
restless and unhappy.

797
01:18:04,849 --> 01:18:09,716
On Easter Day he went for a long
walk in the rain. When he came back,

798
01:18:09,679 --> 01:18:15,948
he told Helena he was leaving.
He said they'd meet again.

799
01:18:16,721 --> 01:18:21,658
Then he called Geneva
and talked To you for an hour.

800
01:18:22,704 --> 01:18:26,640
That evening he left
on the last plane.

801
01:18:39,794 --> 01:18:42,592
During the night I was
woken by Helena crying.

802
01:18:44,051 --> 01:18:47,212
She complained of pain
in her hip and right leg.

803
01:18:48,851 --> 01:18:51,751
She didn't think she could
stand it until morning.

804
01:18:53,234 --> 01:18:56,329
At 5 o'clock I had
to phone for the ambulance.

805
01:19:00,403 --> 01:19:05,170
-So Lena's illness was my fault?
-Yes, I think so.

806
01:19:08,979 --> 01:19:12,643
-You mean that her illness...
-Yes.

807
01:19:16,115 --> 01:19:21,350
-You don't seriously mean...
-When Lena was a year old you deserted her.

808
01:19:22,901 --> 01:19:25,335
Then you kept deserting her
and me all the time.

809
01:19:27,284 --> 01:19:31,015
When Lena got seriously ill,
you sent her to a home.

810
01:19:31,926 --> 01:19:34,894
-It can't be true...
-What can't be true?

811
01:19:36,853 --> 01:19:39,413
Have you any proof
to the contrary?

812
01:19:42,262 --> 01:19:47,131
Look at me, Mama.
Look at Helena.

813
01:19:49,717 --> 01:19:51,982
There are no excuses.

814
01:19:53,848 --> 01:19:58,647
There is only one truth
and one lie.

815
01:19:59,927 --> 01:20:02,293
There can be no forgiveness.

816
01:20:02,903 --> 01:20:09,137
-You can't blame me entirely.
-You expect an exception for you.

817
01:20:10,903 --> 01:20:14,066
You've set up a sort of
discount system with life

818
01:20:16,568 --> 01:20:21,664
but one day you'll see that
your agreement is one-sided.

819
01:20:23,288 --> 01:20:26,656
You'll see you're harboring a
guilt,just like everyone else.

820
01:20:28,377 --> 01:20:30,344
What guilt?

821
01:20:35,545 --> 01:20:37,240
Eva darling.

822
01:20:39,097 --> 01:20:41,794
Won't you forgive me
for all the wrong I've done?

823
01:20:43,673 --> 01:20:45,607
I'll try to mend my ways.

824
01:20:47,482 --> 01:20:51,076
You've got to teach me,
we'll talk to each other.

825
01:20:53,562 --> 01:20:56,895
But help me.
I can't go on.

826
01:20:57,947 --> 01:21:00,074
Your hatred is so terrible.

827
01:21:01,883 --> 01:21:07,617
I haven't realized.
I've been selfish and childish.

828
01:21:11,356 --> 01:21:13,050
Can't you put your
arms around me?

829
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:17,003
Touch me, at least!

830
01:21:19,772 --> 01:21:21,535
Help me!

831
01:21:24,508 --> 01:21:27,272
Mama!

832
01:21:29,852 --> 01:21:30,842
Come!

833
01:21:32,221 --> 01:21:33,483
Help me!

834
01:21:35,004 --> 01:21:36,598
Mama!

835
01:21:39,614 --> 01:21:40,602
Come!

836
01:22:24,192 --> 01:22:28,651
Poor little Mama,
rushing off like that.

837
01:22:29,728 --> 01:22:34,325
She looked so frightened
and suddenly so old and tired.

838
01:22:35,424 --> 01:22:40,419
Her face had shrunk and her
nose was red from crying.

839
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,009
Now I'll never see her again.

840
01:23:00,962 --> 01:23:04,420
It'll be dark soon,
and it's getting cold.

841
01:23:05,891 --> 01:23:08,916
I've got to get home and
make dinner for Viktor and Helena.

842
01:23:11,780 --> 01:23:13,644
I can't die now.

843
01:23:15,364 --> 01:23:17,763
I'm afraid to commit suicide,

844
01:23:19,586 --> 01:23:22,351
and one day maybe God
will want to use me.

845
01:23:23,749 --> 01:23:25,908
Then he'll set me free
from my prison.

846
01:23:42,693 --> 01:23:46,788
I feel so shut out,
I'm always homesick.

847
01:23:46,790 --> 01:23:48,483
But when I get home

848
01:23:49,670 --> 01:23:52,730
I find it's something
else I'm longing for.

849
01:23:55,622 --> 01:23:57,213
Are you stroking my cheek?

850
01:23:59,205 --> 01:24:01,036
Are you whispering in my ear?

851
01:24:02,885 --> 01:24:04,284
Are you with me now?

852
01:24:06,821 --> 01:24:09,449
We'll never leave each other.

853
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:45,036
There's a light on
in Helena's room.

854
01:24:46,793 --> 01:24:48,760
Viktor's there,
talking to her.

855
01:24:50,120 --> 01:24:53,022
That's good.
Kind of him.

856
01:24:54,953 --> 01:24:57,250
He's telling her
Mama has left.

857
01:25:01,642 --> 01:25:03,608
Your mother sent her love.

858
01:25:04,169 --> 01:25:08,105
She was sad and worried.
She'd been crying.

859
01:25:20,554 --> 01:25:23,854
Eva has gone for a walk.

860
01:25:24,299 --> 01:25:27,029
She was looking forward so
much to seeing her mother.

861
01:25:28,203 --> 01:25:30,433
She hoped for too much.

862
01:25:31,212 --> 01:25:34,009
I hadn't the heart to warn her.

863
01:25:43,531 --> 01:25:46,466
I can't understand
what you're saying.

864
01:25:49,387 --> 01:25:51,016
You say you want to...?

865
01:25:52,780 --> 01:25:56,181
Try to speak calmly,

866
01:25:56,205 --> 01:25:59,732
otherwise I can't understand.

867
01:26:05,069 --> 01:26:07,003
Eva! Come quickly!

868
01:26:24,623 --> 01:26:28,252
Sometimes I stand here
looking at my wife

869
01:26:28,270 --> 01:26:30,466
without her knowing.

870
01:26:32,462 --> 01:26:34,191
She's in such distress.

871
01:26:35,056 --> 01:26:38,456
Since Charlotte left so suddenly

872
01:26:38,479 --> 01:26:40,538
she has been terribly upset.

873
01:26:42,255 --> 01:26:44,086
She has not been able to sleep.

874
01:26:45,008 --> 01:26:47,806
She says she drove
her mother away

875
01:26:48,047 --> 01:26:50,209
and can never forgive herself.

876
01:26:50,513 --> 01:26:54,643
-Are you going out?
-Just down to the post office.

877
01:26:54,673 --> 01:26:57,506
Could you please mail
this letter for me?

878
01:26:57,553 --> 01:27:01,319
Sure.
It's to Charlotte?

879
01:27:01,330 --> 01:27:04,958
Read it if you like.
I'm going up to Helena.

880
01:27:10,514 --> 01:27:14,574
" Dear Mama! I realize
that I wronged you.

881
01:27:15,538 --> 01:27:18,665
"I met you with demands
instead of affection.

882
01:27:19,315 --> 01:27:23,081
"I tormented you with an old
hatred that's no longer real.

883
01:27:23,443 --> 01:27:26,877
"I want to ask your forgiveness."

884
01:27:27,154 --> 01:27:30,522
I don't know if this
letter will reach you.

885
01:27:30,546 --> 01:27:32,741
I don't even know
if you will read it.

886
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:36,544
Maybe everything
is already too late.

887
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:43,289
But I hope all the same that
my discovery will not be in vain.

888
01:27:44,275 --> 01:27:46,709
There is a kind
of mercy after all.

889
01:27:47,348 --> 01:27:52,411
I mean the enormous opportunity of
getting to take care of each other,

890
01:27:53,812 --> 01:27:55,713
to help each other,

891
01:27:57,108 --> 01:27:58,906
to show affection.

892
01:28:01,620 --> 01:28:04,920
I will never let you
vanish out of my life again.

893
01:28:06,517 --> 01:28:08,451
I'm going to persist.

894
01:28:09,397 --> 01:28:13,231
I won't give up,
even if it is too late.

895
01:28:14,262 --> 01:28:16,492
I don't think it is too late.

896
01:28:19,125 --> 01:28:21,390
It must not be too late.
