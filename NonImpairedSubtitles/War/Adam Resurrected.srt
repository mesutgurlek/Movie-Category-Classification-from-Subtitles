1
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:04,521
<i>I had once the beautiful fatherland.</i> 

2
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,649
<i>The oak tree grew so high there.</i>

3
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,611
<i>Violets nodded softly.</i>

4
00:01:10,737 --> 00:01:13,280
<i>It was a dream.</i>

5
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:17,951
<i>It kissed me in German
and spoke in German.</i>

6
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,497
<i>You would hardly believe
how good it sounded,</i>

7
00:01:21,623 --> 00:01:26,794
<i>the words, ich liebe dich,
I love you.</i>

8
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,758
<i>It was a dream.</i>

9
00:01:32,884 --> 00:01:34,968
Adam.

10
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,723
Adam, it's time.

11
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:42,643
Oh, my landlady Ruth Edelson.

12
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:44,019
Let me ask you something.

13
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:48,107
Am I still handsome this morning?

14
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:50,317
Tell the truth now, come on.

15
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:52,945
Of course you are, Adam.

16
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:06,834
I don't think there's any time 
for the-

17
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,168
for the breakfast.

18
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:11,338
You know, I have never asked you, 
my darling,

19
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:13,006
how old are you?

20
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,675
Forgive me, you are the witch.

21
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,801
You are the hexer.

22
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,011
You have swindled time.

23
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,138
Adam, please.

24
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,931
After you fell asleep last night, darling,

25
00:02:21,057 --> 00:02:22,015
I lay there.

26
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,142
I was thinking,

27
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,563
"My God, this woman's skin
is unnaturally smooth."

28
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:29,022
It is like porcelain.

29
00:02:29,149 --> 00:02:31,275
In fact, I can see my reflection in it.

30
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:40,409
Now, what are you hiding under there?

31
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,703
Darling, show me.

32
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:43,829
- Show me, show me.
- Adam.

33
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:47,624
Come here, just a little peek.

34
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,210
A bruise?

35
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:58,010
I'm sorry, Adam, believe me.

36
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:02,514
Forgive me, Adam.

37
00:03:08,897 --> 00:03:10,022
Morning, Adam.

38
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,732
All set to go.

39
00:03:11,858 --> 00:03:13,525
Yeah, do not forget this Olivetti please.

40
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,068
We won't, pal, come on.

41
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,862
Forgive me, Adam.

42
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,739
I shouldn't have called them.

43
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:23,577
Please forgive me.

44
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,788
It's all right, Ruth.

45
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:29,750
Oh, you taste like...

46
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,044
soap.

47
00:04:35,942 --> 00:04:38,068
So why'd you do it, Adam?

48
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,528
Do it?

49
00:04:39,654 --> 00:04:42,030
What is it you think that I did?

50
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:44,199
You know, that old magic trick

51
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:47,869
where you separate a woman's spinal column 
from her skull.

52
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:49,413
Choking his landlady.

53
00:04:49,539 --> 00:04:51,915
Oh, this is- that's ridiculous.

54
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,917
Nah, he didn't mean to hurt her.

55
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,169
Just wanted us to bring him home again.

56
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,296
Right, Adam?

57
00:04:57,422 --> 00:05:00,257
Yeah, woof, woof.

58
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:07,723
<i>And so I was once again returned</i> 

59
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,518
<i>to my home in the desert,</i>

60
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:14,646
<i>The Seizling Institute,</i>

61
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:19,109
<i>founded by American philanthropist 
Rebecca Seizling</i>

62
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:24,281
<i>as a center under the direction
of Dr. Nathan Gross</i>

63
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,867
<i>for innovative therapy</i>

64
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:32,331
<i>and as a home for the survivors
of the Nazi camps.</i>

65
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,018
Muhammad.

66
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,690
Do you see that?

67
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:07,908
Come on.

68
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,243
Big guy's waiting.

69
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:25,675
Adam.

70
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:33,600
Oh, that's a big hug.

71
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,726
He's back.

72
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,311
I am so happy to see you too.

73
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,854
Yes, still sweeping.

74
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,107
Am I tracking- 
I don't want to track sand on your-

75
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,233
on your floor.

76
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,944
And heil to Rebecca.

77
00:06:49,075 --> 00:06:51,618
All my best friends.

78
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:52,828
What's this?

79
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,080
Oh, transport.

80
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:04,131
Have they all gone insane?
Well...

81
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,799
Two hundred bucks.

82
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,385
Adam, been hiding them for months.

83
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,512
You've got to tell me what to do.

84
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,639
AT&T, Mr. Blum,
New York Stock Exchange.

85
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:13,765
Here, give it to me.

86
00:07:13,891 --> 00:07:15,934
I will double it for you in-
in no time.

87
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,186
- Adam.
- Yeah?

88
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:21,731
Columbus was Jew?

89
00:07:21,858 --> 00:07:23,150
Yes, yes, Mrs. Lipowitz.

90
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:25,777
Columbus was definitely a Jew

91
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,696
but also an Italian,
so as a matter of fact,

92
00:07:27,822 --> 00:07:30,532
I would not trust an Italian,
and neither should you.

93
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,076
Yeah, it's true,
they're an enlightened bunch.

94
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:36,204
But they licked the jackboot,

95
00:07:36,330 --> 00:07:39,291
and now they expect everyone
to forgive and forget.

96
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,160
- My train.
- Yeah.

97
00:08:15,286 --> 00:08:16,244
You.

98
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:18,872
Really, Arthur, you know that
Mrs. Seizling strictly forbade

99
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:21,208
any form of locomotive combustion 
at the Institute.

100
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,334
My train.

101
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,377
Arthur-

102
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:25,712
You know what I'm talking about.

103
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,088
Fellow survivors, it's so good

104
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:28,548
to be back here at the Institute,

105
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:31,218
though not as inmate,
not as guinea pig.

106
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:33,887
No, this time,
I am on the mission

107
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,014
to expose the lunacy

108
00:08:36,140 --> 00:08:38,934
of the medical staff here
at the Seizling Institute,

109
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,977
the negligence, Dr. Shapiro,

110
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:42,062
and the impotence

111
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:45,815
of Herr Professor Nathan Gross, et al.

112
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,400
He's lying.

113
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:48,735
Authorized by whom?

114
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,202
<i>And here she comes.</i> 

115
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,455
<i>I could hear her methodical footfalls</i>

116
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:02,832
<i>and irregular heartbeat.</i>

117
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,126
<i>Nurse Gina Grey,</i>

118
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,046
<i>a pearl in a dunghill,</i>

119
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,257
<i>a book of rules,</i>

120
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:15,262
<i>and with that classy ass.</i>

121
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:20,433
Arthur, please stop that.

122
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,102
No.

123
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,186
No.

124
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,771
Adam.

125
00:09:24,897 --> 00:09:25,855
Would you come with me?

126
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:27,941
Dr. Gross wants to say hello.

127
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,109
No. No.

128
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,736
Would you please swallow those pills, 
Mr. Blum?

129
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:36,533
Hmm, not now.

130
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,876
You've lost some weight, Adam.

131
00:09:47,003 --> 00:09:49,921
Oh, yeah, I was- I was pining for you, 
my child.

132
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:51,631
The nights have been the worst,
you know.

133
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:52,716
Hmm.

134
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:54,676
I've heard about your nights.

135
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,887
But I'm sure you didn't mean
to hurt your landlady.

136
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,015
Come in, Adam.

137
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,349
Oh, come here, Gina.

138
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:04,144
Let me smell something.

139
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,148
Oh, yeah, just like I remember.

140
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,316
Touch me.

141
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:17,157
Touch me.

142
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,367
Come in already.

143
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,798
Yes, you love doing that,
don't you, Adam?

144
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:39,429
Uh, oh, yeah, the-
the sharp transition.

145
00:10:39,555 --> 00:10:40,513
Here one moment...

146
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,931
You know, Adam-

147
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,433
Gone the next.

148
00:10:43,559 --> 00:10:45,977
What I can't figure out,

149
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,437
why haven't we been able to help you?

150
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:49,397
You're a brilliant man.

151
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:50,607
You've been called a genius.

152
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,692
Name: Adam Stein,
next of kin: none whatsoever,

153
00:10:52,818 --> 00:10:53,818
number on my arm:

154
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,362
sieben, sechs, drei, vier, fuenf.

155
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:57,030
Gross, file it away and let me go.

156
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,992
And yet, you see,
for all your knowledge,

157
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,662
your sixth, seventh sense,
here you are

158
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:06,581
back at the Institute
after trying to kill a woman

159
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:08,208
less than 24 hours ago.

160
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,417
This is a lie.

161
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:11,211
No, this is a lie.

162
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:12,379
- Yes.
- No, that's a lie.

163
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:16,675
A woman named Ruth Edelson.

164
00:11:16,801 --> 00:11:19,386
And you, Gross, you are-
you're a joke.

165
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,639
Ah, do you want to tell me why?

166
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:25,392
Yeah, back there,
it was absurd to believe...

167
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,518
in anything.

168
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:27,602
In the sun we did not believe.

169
00:11:27,728 --> 00:11:31,064
And yet you, here of all places,
you believe in miracles.

170
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:34,442
You not only believe in them;
you depend on them.

171
00:11:34,568 --> 00:11:38,321
This is not only hilarious;
this is chutzpah.

172
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:39,948
- Adam.
- Yeah?

173
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:42,158
There's only one person in this institute

174
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,410
who can work miracles.

175
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,286
They're circus tricks.

176
00:11:45,413 --> 00:11:46,579
I could teach them to you in a day.

177
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:47,706
Listen, Grossie.

178
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,084
See, I've been the- the star of your-

179
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,919
your medical experiments,

180
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:54,921
and you have failed miserably.

181
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,882
So don't you dare talk to me
about some miracles.

182
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:00,051
Now, of course, my job is to fail.

183
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,219
I am the sick dying clown.

184
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:02,303
Fine, this is my business.

185
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:04,848
But what have you done to help me,

186
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,934
to help any of us?

187
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,186
No, you're right.

188
00:12:10,312 --> 00:12:12,355
And I'm sorry
from the bottom of my heart.

189
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:14,566
As long as you know.

190
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,900
Now let's just see what's going on

191
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:17,986
with your lovely personal affairs.

192
00:12:18,112 --> 00:12:19,112
Oh, now, wait a minute.

193
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:20,196
Please.

194
00:12:20,322 --> 00:12:22,615
Adam, stop.

195
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,202
It has not been your day,
has it, Doctor?

196
00:12:26,328 --> 00:12:27,662
Some milk of magnesia.

197
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:29,122
That would solve the problem.

198
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,416
Constipation, it's a horrible thing, 
but don't strain.

199
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:32,500
Cut it out.

200
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:33,918
You don't have to suffer that way.

201
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:36,546
If only you'd use your gift
a little more constructively.

202
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:38,131
Oh, I could if I wanted to.

203
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:41,342
But, you know, I- I do not.

204
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:49,976
No, I am going to be your miracle 
that never was.

205
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:52,562
And we've heard all this before, Adam.

206
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:53,938
Go on and get some rest.

207
00:12:54,064 --> 00:12:56,441
Go, already.
Get out of here.

208
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,911
Where the hell is all this coming from?

209
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:11,998
And no pulse.

210
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:13,291
Maybe in a hundred years,

211
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:15,543
we'll know how to help
the Adam Steins of this world.

212
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:16,669
Adam.

213
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:18,004
- Step back, Rachel.
- Adam.

214
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:19,255
Get away from him.

215
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:20,340
Rachel.

216
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,509
- Is it time, Adam?
- Step away from him.

217
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,761
Rachel.

218
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,935
Oh, thank God.

219
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,480
The birth pang of the Messiah. 

220
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:36,648
I knew it.

221
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,360
They've begun.

222
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,028
Oy vey.

223
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,074
It's good to have you back, Adam.

224
00:14:03,634 --> 00:14:07,136
Frau Fogel, the whisky
in the baby bottle, please.

225
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,305
My wife, Gretchen.

226
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:10,390
Little Ruthie.

227
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,933
Thank you, Frau Fogel.

228
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,410
Ah, malt whisky.

229
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,748
It's for the good night's sleep, yeah?

230
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,834
All right, please.

231
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,295
Oh.

232
00:14:40,421 --> 00:14:41,880
Gretchen.

233
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:42,964
So sweet.

234
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,090
Blech.

235
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,216
Ah, she doesn't like it.

236
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:46,301
She doesn't like it.

237
00:14:46,427 --> 00:14:49,220
The most expensive Stradivarius.

238
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:50,305
Here we go.

239
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,959
Ladies and gentlemen,

240
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,128
meine Damen und Herren

241
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:25,632
Adam Stein.

242
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,966
My wife, Gretchen.

243
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,426
Oh, so beautiful.

244
00:15:28,552 --> 00:15:31,346
Oh, no, no, you cannot keep survival 
off the stage.

245
00:15:31,472 --> 00:15:32,513
Don't scare me like this.

246
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:33,640
My darling.

247
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:34,849
A volunteer.

248
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,142
Oh-ma-ha. 

249
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:38,686
Yeah-ha.

250
00:15:38,812 --> 00:15:39,854
Everybody loves this.

251
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,397
No, you volunteer too often.

252
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:42,941
This fellow, please, may we?

253
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,025
Bitte nicht.

254
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:46,235
Please, my eye fell on you 
right away, please.

255
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,988
Such a good sport, give him a hand.

256
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,573
He's shy.

257
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,867
All right, now, have we ever met?

258
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:53,993
Do we know each other?

259
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,787
- Nein.
- Nein.

260
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,373
All right.

261
00:16:03,045 --> 00:16:06,798
This young man,
ladies and gentlemen,

262
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:08,925
well, did not want to come
to Adam's circus tonight.

263
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,218
This man had other plans.

264
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:13,262
This very night he intended...

265
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:14,597
to take his own life.

266
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:17,475
No, my friend, no.

267
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,102
Please, do not go this way.

268
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:21,562
Let me just glean just a little.

269
00:16:21,689 --> 00:16:22,981
Maybe there's some good news here.

270
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,399
Let me see.

271
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:27,694
We have here, folks, 
a graduate of Heidelberg Universitaet.

272
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:31,990
Oh, though, obviously no-
no star pupil.

273
00:16:32,116 --> 00:16:35,910
This is Zyklot 17,
the animal tranquilizer.

274
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:39,998
Yeah, for the permanent relief of pain.

275
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,836
Yeah.

276
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:48,381
Oh.

277
00:16:48,507 --> 00:16:49,882
Oh.

278
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:49,817
Tell her to leave me alone.

279
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:52,403
I do not have the strength.

280
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:59,285
Do you hear what I'm asking you?

281
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:08,211
I would if I wanted to.

282
00:18:08,337 --> 00:18:09,670
But I don't.

283
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:19,472
What the hell are you doing?

284
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:22,767
Shut up, darling, and move over.

285
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:24,477
You are insane.

286
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:26,312
I am calling the night nurse.

287
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:30,233
Right here at your service? Adam?

288
00:18:56,552 --> 00:18:58,010
Ladies and gentlemen,

289
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,472
we bring now to the stage my daughter,

290
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:07,061
the amazing, the brain-bending,
Miss Ruthie.

291
00:19:07,187 --> 00:19:08,354
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

292
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,365
Isn't she so amazing?

293
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:20,449
You are my angel.

294
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,119
Do not be frightened.

295
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:25,037
You cannot see anything,
can you, Ruthie?

296
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,122
- No.
- No.

297
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,208
She says no.

298
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,003
She's looking askance at me, 
my- my darling wife.

299
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,672
Oh, I love to get a smile
out of my wife.

300
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:37,550
Give her a big hand.

301
00:19:37,676 --> 00:19:38,718
What's down there?

302
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,052
Ah, I love that.

303
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,721
Ow.

304
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:42,889
My wife, Gretchen.

305
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:47,393
I pick up the first blade,
so absolute silence.

306
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:48,477
Here we are.

307
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,234
Ruthie, don't.

308
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,612
She will do anything to avoid this part.

309
00:19:57,738 --> 00:19:59,447
You don't like this part,
but no brain bending.

310
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:00,573
That is-

311
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,983
When you pulled up the thing
and you winked at the audience

312
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,069
and they went crazy,
you were killing me.

313
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:39,153
That stays in the show.

314
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:40,279
Papa.

315
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,614
You are a little genius, I think.

316
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,698
Papa, there's a man.

317
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:44,784
Was that spontaneous,
or did you work it out before?

318
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:45,868
Tell me.

319
00:20:45,994 --> 00:20:47,995
- That's your bit.
- Adam, it's him.

320
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,417
Volk.

321
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,298
Well, Herr Stein.

322
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,802
All performers must be members
of the Reichstheaterkammer.

323
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,179
You do not qualify.

324
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:06,931
No sense of humor at all.

325
00:21:07,057 --> 00:21:08,724
Tell me this.

326
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:13,020
Did your men like that bit with the bear?

327
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,064
Erschiessen.

328
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,704
You were warned, Adam.

329
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,258
I am not political.

330
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,802
Everyone loves the circus.

331
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,148
Well, I have to admit,

332
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:59,317
things have been less interesting around here.

333
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:00,901
It seems incredible.

334
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:03,362
A man who only yesterday spewed out

335
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:05,281
streams of blood from his toe.

336
00:22:05,407 --> 00:22:09,493
Not to mention the pancreatic tumor 
he sprouted in March.

337
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:13,039
And the heart attack last summer.

338
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:16,625
The man has actually spat out
part of a lung.

339
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:21,005
I mean, it's an amazing thing,
the self-destruction.

340
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,965
The amazing thing about Adam Stein

341
00:22:23,091 --> 00:22:25,551
isn't his control over his body.

342
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,011
It's his power over you, Nathan.

343
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,512
What?

344
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:30,890
And a few other staff members
I could name.

345
00:22:31,016 --> 00:22:31,974
Relax, Uri.

346
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,392
Eat your foie gras.

347
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,811
- Adam.
- Look who's here.

348
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:36,896
And, Wolfowitz, now look,

349
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:40,274
mein Gott im Himmel,
you look just awful.

350
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,693
It's just not- not good.

351
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,988
Ah, Rachel, oh, you pumpkin.

352
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,406
Gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous.

353
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,950
And Zelda, dear, yeah,
you keep the sky from falling,

354
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,077
but- but sit.

355
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,912
Adam, Schwester's been dreaming again

356
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,246
with her nonsense.

357
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,082
She says it's soon, very soon.

358
00:22:56,208 --> 00:22:57,583
And she is right, Wolfowitz.

359
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,001
Yes, beautiful, what is it?

360
00:22:59,127 --> 00:23:00,086
Tell me.

361
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,088
He came again last night.

362
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,172
- Shh.
- It's a secret?

363
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,840
The Archangel.

364
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:07,760
He lay beside me and said,

365
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:11,263
"This time Adam has returned
to lead the sufferers,

366
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,809
"the bearers of the blue numbers, 
to the desert.

367
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,602
The gates of heaven will open and-"

368
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,312
No, of course- of course I will, Rachel.

369
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,231
That day is near, but not yet, dear.

370
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:22,691
Not- not before lunch.

371
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,777
I will usher and proclaim and rescue.

372
00:23:24,903 --> 00:23:26,779
Me, the clown?

373
00:23:33,578 --> 00:23:37,790
You see that?

374
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,919
You know he takes money from the patients?

375
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:45,339
Invests it in the stock market.

376
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,007
Gross.

377
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,134
You?

378
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,219
For the Institute, Slonim.

379
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,637
I mean, whatever else he is,

380
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:55,307
he's a very astute financial advisor.

381
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:58,602
You're worse than Rachel Schwester over there.

382
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:00,312
She thinks he'll lead them all to salvation.

383
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,106
Adam, I need to talk to you.

384
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:04,442
No, later, later.

385
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,700
What is it?

386
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,826
What is it, Adam?

387
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:14,910
Hoof beats?

388
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:16,036
Gross.

389
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:25,129
Who let a dog in here?

390
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,561
Nathan, who let a dog in here?

391
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:44,190
What are you talking about?

392
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,025
There's no dog here.

393
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:48,777
When I first came here,

394
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:54,742
they promised me that there would never, 
ever be any dogs.

395
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:58,204
How could you?

396
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,247
Calm down.

397
00:25:42,999 --> 00:25:46,168
Edward, how are you today?

398
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,295
My God.

399
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:48,314
Adam.

400
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,149
Adam.

401
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,993
All right.

402
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:04,622
Come on, Adam, come on.

403
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,751
Okay.

404
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,797
Yeah, good.

405
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,507
Good.

406
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:16,634
Yeah.

407
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:33,817
Papa.

408
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,570
You are my angel, Ruthie.

409
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:37,696
Do not be frightened.

410
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:56,590
You.

411
00:27:56,716 --> 00:28:00,260
Well, Adam Stein.

412
00:28:00,387 --> 00:28:02,680
The funniest man in Germany,

413
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:06,392
delivered to Stellring,
of all places.

414
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:10,938
Come here, Adam.

415
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,526
I am Commandant Klein.

416
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:20,364
I can't tell you how happy I am
to see you here.

417
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,742
You should have seen him
at the circus in Berlin.

418
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:26,620
Any kind of animal, he could do it.

419
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:29,123
Such a clown.

420
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:31,834
Go on, Adam.

421
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,627
Do a trick.

422
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:39,133
Make us laugh.

423
00:28:53,022 --> 00:28:54,356
Mama, Mama.

424
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,524
Ruthie?

425
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,651
Where are you taking me?

426
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,284
No, no, no.

427
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:09,329
Now- now do a dog for Rex here.

428
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,374
You've made a friend, Adam.

429
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:57,836
The smell of a Jew
usually sends Rex into a frenzy.

430
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:02,883
Sergeant, take Herr Stein to Rex's pen.

431
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:04,218
No, Adam...

432
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:05,969
on all fours.

433
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:09,807
It's funnier that way.

434
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,923
Go on, Adam...

435
00:30:43,049 --> 00:30:45,717
or Rex will get all the meat.

436
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:48,720
I followed your career, Adam.

437
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:52,349
You studied philosophy at Heidelberg, 
didn't you?

438
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:53,517
Funny we never met there.

439
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,227
Herr Kommandant, please.

440
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:56,770
I'm a keen observer,

441
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:59,231
a student of the Semitic phenomenon.

442
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:01,275
Of course, you're not an average specimen,

443
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:03,735
Germany's most celebrated clown.

444
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,154
You're a superman, Adam,
practically Aryan.

445
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,615
So maybe we can help each other.

446
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:09,741
Head down.

447
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,452
Don't look at me.

448
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,209
A life for a life.

449
00:31:19,335 --> 00:31:20,335
Mine for yours.

450
00:31:20,461 --> 00:31:22,921
You stay here with me,
make me laugh,

451
00:31:23,047 --> 00:31:26,008
keep my mind off the business outside.

452
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,802
Believe me, it's a thankless job.

453
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,637
My wife and daughters.

454
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:34,057
What's that?

455
00:31:34,183 --> 00:31:35,309
Speak up, Adam.

456
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:37,269
My wife and daughters.

457
00:31:39,188 --> 00:31:42,107
Bargaining already, Adam.

458
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,818
The Semitic phenomenon in action,

459
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,529
right here at my feet.

460
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:51,199
Unfortunately, 
I am only Untersturmfuehrer.

461
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:52,618
I don't make the rules.

462
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:53,702
But we'll see.

463
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,997
Yes, we have plenty of time.

464
00:31:57,123 --> 00:32:00,709
Rex.

465
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,962
Go on, Adam.

466
00:32:10,219 --> 00:32:11,637
Wonderful, Adam.

467
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:12,971
Now, eat.

468
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,598
Eat.

469
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,682
Schmackhaft.

470
00:32:24,108 --> 00:32:27,110
Nothing with claws or paws.

471
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,737
Seizling gave me her word.

472
00:32:28,863 --> 00:32:34,284
Room 285 is in the observation ward.

473
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:36,828
It's off-limits.

474
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:38,038
Now, Gina tells me

475
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:40,749
that you slept on the floor again 
last night.

476
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,210
Oh, is this how you're going
to break me, Gross,

477
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:44,586
with a dog?

478
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,171
Well, nice try.

479
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:47,381
But look at me.

480
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:49,091
See? 
I'm smiling.

481
00:32:49,217 --> 00:32:53,595
No, actually, Adam, you're crying.

482
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:58,642
It is-
Yeah, you momzer- water.

483
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:00,852
I had a- I had a drink of water
on the way.

484
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,187
Through your eyes?

485
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,439
Come on, Adam,
you can do better than that.

486
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,483
Okay, I am ready for you,
Frankenstein.

487
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:12,030
If experiments are your game,
then let's play.

488
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,115
Give me your best shot.

489
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,910
But before you cure me,

490
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:19,329
you will all go crazy yourselves.

491
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,792
The door to 285 is locked.

492
00:33:35,138 --> 00:33:38,432
I'm glad to see you feeling better, Adam,

493
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:39,891
but we're a little busy at the moment.

494
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,354
Not now.

495
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:53,363
You and I, my darling,
we're going to cry together,

496
00:33:53,489 --> 00:33:55,907
and I'm going to drink your tears.

497
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,576
Yes, I love very deeply.

498
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,578
It is the romance supreme.

499
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:02,456
Do you understand, my- my dar-

500
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,291
There are rules, Adam.

501
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:05,834
Compassion.

502
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,918
Mercy.

503
00:34:07,045 --> 00:34:08,045
You're the nurse.

504
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,129
What- what happened to-

505
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,883
You break the tiniest rule,
you break the entire system.

506
00:34:13,009 --> 00:34:15,260
Do you know who is also
a great believer in the rules?

507
00:34:15,386 --> 00:34:16,595
Hmm?

508
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,263
Kommandant Klein.

509
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,639
Ow.

510
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:23,435
What a terrible thing to say.

511
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:29,775
Yeah, well, I only insult people I love.

512
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,901
You don't love me.

513
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,944
You treat me like a dog. 

514
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,362
Yeah, exactly.

515
00:34:34,489 --> 00:34:35,781
Oh, but you're so wrong.

516
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:38,241
With you, I lose control.

517
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:39,868
When I was strangling the landlady,

518
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,912
who do you think
I was really strangling, Gina?

519
00:34:42,038 --> 00:34:42,996
You.

520
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:44,372
You bastard.

521
00:34:44,499 --> 00:34:45,457
Do it.

522
00:34:45,583 --> 00:34:46,958
Do it like I taught you, sweetheart.

523
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,462
No, they'll hear me.

524
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,548
Do it.

525
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:59,805
Yeah, down on your knees and crawl.

526
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:00,931
That is correct.

527
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,818
Yeah, but that sounds like a schnauzer.

528
00:35:12,944 --> 00:35:13,985
I want the wolfhound.

529
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:24,996
Oh, I like it.

530
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:33,338
Oh, that's right.

531
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:38,635
Oh, that's right.

532
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:45,559
You're despicable, darling.

533
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:51,648
Just give it back when you're done.

534
00:36:55,004 --> 00:37:00,425
Let me see what kind of beast
has Gross brought here.

535
00:37:00,551 --> 00:37:02,385
Let me see what you are.

536
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,470
Come here.

537
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,268
Ow!

538
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:35,377
You know you can't be in here, Adam.

539
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:36,461
Come on.

540
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,587
Come on, let's go.

541
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:38,672
Bad dog. 

542
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:39,798
Bad dog.

543
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:41,216
Bad dog.

544
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:43,218
Okay, let me see your hand.

545
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:46,680
<i>I told it I'd be back,
and it understood.</i>

546
00:37:46,806 --> 00:37:47,931
Get back in there.

547
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,436
The stench.

548
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,772
Lying in his own goddamn feces.

549
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:59,734
<i>But the attendant,
that flea-bitten gibbon,</i>

550
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,528
<i>he did not.</i>

551
00:38:01,654 --> 00:38:02,737
Adam, stop.

552
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:06,992
Stop it now.

553
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:12,622
Son of a bitch.

554
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:15,417
Crazy son of a bitch.

555
00:38:18,045 --> 00:38:21,840
Before Hitler, we were hated
by the rest of Europe,

556
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,342
loved only by our Jews,

557
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:26,177
who somehow convinced themselves

558
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:31,099
that our two nations shared a common destiny.

559
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,934
A pair of pariahs,

560
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,480
so said your man Kafka,
that demented Hebrew.

561
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:40,608
Sprung from the same bosom.

562
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,403
No wonder it's such messy business

563
00:38:43,529 --> 00:38:46,906
vomiting you from our midst.

564
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,199
Adam!

565
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,369
Down, boy!

566
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,331
Without rules, there is chaos.

567
00:38:54,457 --> 00:38:56,624
I know you can appreciate this.

568
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,460
Even in a circus, there are rules. 

569
00:38:58,586 --> 00:38:59,669
Herr Kommandant.

570
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,838
Those trucks outside, the Red Cross.

571
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:03,131
Shh.

572
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:05,550
You don't hear Rex begging for favors, do you?

573
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:08,219
They are taking prisoners to Matsdorflager.

574
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,013
Ask them to take three more.

575
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,891
Rex knows his role:
to serve and protect.

576
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:15,894
You know yours:
to comfort and entertain.

577
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,104
And who knows?

578
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,566
Maybe that in itself
can save a life, yes?

579
00:39:21,692 --> 00:39:22,692
Yes.

580
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:26,696
Danke schoen.

581
00:39:26,822 --> 00:39:29,324
Look, Adam.

582
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:34,037
Look what I found for you.

583
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:42,087
It once played in the Dresden Orchestra.

584
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,589
There's been some rethinking.

585
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,759
We have new work for you.

586
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,310
That's nice, Adam.

587
00:39:57,436 --> 00:39:59,604
Adam Stein?

588
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:01,898
Frau Fogel.

589
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,108
Listen, Adam.

590
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,651
I have news.

591
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:05,777
Quiet over there.

592
00:40:05,903 --> 00:40:07,278
Ruthie's alive, inside Germany,

593
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,155
someplace special.

594
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:18,540
Play it, Adam.

595
00:40:28,759 --> 00:40:31,344
You're crying, Adam.

596
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:33,138
It is water.

597
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,266
I had some water before.

598
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:37,350
Did I kill him?

599
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:40,186
Almost.

600
00:40:40,312 --> 00:40:42,647
You've got to be more careful, Adam.

601
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:43,773
We still need you.

602
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:44,941
Danke schoen.

603
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:50,447
Listen, Adam.

604
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:52,866
I've had it.

605
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:58,329
In a month's time on Purim's Eve in 1962,

606
00:40:58,456 --> 00:41:01,166
Abe Wolfowitz is going to be a dead man.

607
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,250
What?

608
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,587
I've been sewing my own shrouds 
from bed sheets.

609
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:06,963
Don't tell Gina.

610
00:41:07,089 --> 00:41:10,258
You are not going to leave me alone 
in this madhouse, Abe.

611
00:41:10,384 --> 00:41:12,552
Seriously, Adam.

612
00:41:12,678 --> 00:41:14,804
Me and- and Him,

613
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:17,348
we're going to have it out
once and for all.

614
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,227
I want to know how-

615
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:25,064
how He could be so cruel.

616
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,734
And if He won't come to me,
I'll go to Him,

617
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:29,777
and you'll write my eulogy.

618
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:32,655
Okay, I- I'll write your eulogy.

619
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:35,492
Such a beautiful child,
my little Naomi.

620
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,746
Didn't look anything like me.

621
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:43,541
Got it all from her mother.

622
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,376
You write it down, Adam.

623
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,295
What do I write, Wolfie,
addressed to whom, God?

624
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,379
God is out to lunch.

625
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,548
He left a note, see, on your-
on your arm.

626
00:41:50,674 --> 00:41:51,883
Don't say that name.

627
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:53,968
You are not going to kill yourself.

628
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:57,222
You remind me of Rabbi Lichtenstein,

629
00:41:57,348 --> 00:41:59,974
who- who back in Stellring-
listen- would argue

630
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,521
that our debasement
was not God's doing but Satan's.

631
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:05,813
Listen.

632
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,774
But I would argue
that the crimes of Klein

633
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,900
are the crimes of Hitler,

634
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,401
but the crimes of Hitler
are the crimes of the Lord.

635
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,569
No, no, no, no, Adam.

636
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:12,904
You get some rest.

637
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:16,491
We can do this later.

638
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:18,368
But wait, wait, Wolfie.

639
00:42:18,494 --> 00:42:23,748
The- the thing in 285 barks like a dog,

640
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:27,710
smells like a dog, but uh, the teeth?

641
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:32,173
Do I know, Adam?

642
00:42:32,299 --> 00:42:35,093
It's- it's just some crazy kid
raised in a basement

643
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:36,761
with a chain around its neck.

644
00:42:36,887 --> 00:42:38,805
A kid?

645
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,265
Gross says it's dangerous.

646
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:42,517
Nobody goes near it.

647
00:42:42,643 --> 00:42:45,186
He's Gross' special project.

648
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,749
So you think-

649
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:08,251
you think that you are the only one?

650
00:43:08,377 --> 00:43:10,003
Yeah?

651
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:11,129
Yeah.

652
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:12,589
Let me tell you,

653
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:17,552
oh, there are others.

654
00:43:17,678 --> 00:43:20,471
Me, for instance.

655
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:23,016
Yeah.

656
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,642
Oh, yeah.

657
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,853
I am the con man.

658
00:43:26,979 --> 00:43:28,229
I am the freak.

659
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:31,190
I am the monstrosity.

660
00:43:31,317 --> 00:43:34,485
I am the genius.

661
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:39,824
But true genius,
it comes with a price.

662
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,327
Yeah, the singer joins the opera.

663
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:45,038
The mathematician unlocks
the secrets of the universe.

664
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:46,372
But me?

665
00:43:46,498 --> 00:43:49,208
Oh, my gifts, worthless.

666
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:52,503
And so I was marked for the circus.

667
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:57,216
I was destined for the sideshow.

668
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,676
And for the doghouse.

669
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:01,012
Yeah.

670
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,722
Oh, you didn't know this, did you?

671
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,265
Oh, yeah.

672
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:09,437
For one whole year,
I ate from the dog bowl,

673
00:44:09,563 --> 00:44:11,773
lived on all fours,

674
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,859
slept in the pen,
shat on the ground. 

675
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,528
I learned from the master.

676
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:18,613
Sturmfuehrer Rex.

677
00:44:21,575 --> 00:44:25,453
But now do you see where my gifts 
have delivered me?

678
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,830
Now, hang on, come here.

679
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,124
Wait, wait, come here.

680
00:44:30,250 --> 00:44:31,250
Shh.

681
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:35,588
Hang on. Hang on.

682
00:44:35,714 --> 00:44:38,591
Yeah, let me just see this.

683
00:44:58,779 --> 00:45:04,409
<i>The dog that is not the dog,
the child that is not the child.</i>

684
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:09,747
<i>This is the way they looked,
back there in the camps,</i>

685
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:14,752
<i>sunken cheeks, tubercular chests,</i>

686
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:18,005
<i>and from inside the blackened sockets,</i>

687
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:22,093
<i>those eyes sick with fear but alive.</i>

688
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,434
Enough, Arthur.

689
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:36,232
Adam.

690
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,067
Shame on you.

691
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,453
This is a place for survivors, right?

692
00:45:48,579 --> 00:45:49,579
Yes.

693
00:45:49,705 --> 00:45:51,664
Well, what is this boy doing here?

694
00:45:51,790 --> 00:45:54,834
Why- what are you doing
with this comb?

695
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:58,963
Gina, do not- don't make-
don't do it with the comb.

696
00:45:59,089 --> 00:46:01,007
Well, Dr. Gross brought him.

697
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:02,133
Yes, Gross.

698
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,343
He was howling and biting himself,

699
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,929
sodden with his own filth.

700
00:46:07,055 --> 00:46:08,723
We tried to get that awful chain off him,

701
00:46:08,849 --> 00:46:10,266
but, you saw; it's still on.

702
00:46:10,392 --> 00:46:12,018
No one has the right
to be more than me,

703
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:13,269
not you, not the dog.

704
00:46:13,395 --> 00:46:15,730
- More what?
- Crazy.

705
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:17,690
He's crazier than me.

706
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:18,858
You're not crazy.

707
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:19,984
I am crazy.

708
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,486
- You're sick.
- No, I am crazy.

709
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:22,570
You're sick.

710
00:46:22,696 --> 00:46:25,156
That dog is superior to me,
do you understand this?

711
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:26,282
No?

712
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,742
He has succeeded where I have failed.

713
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:29,702
He is Gross' star.

714
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:36,167
I think I have a right to say-

715
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:39,003
That you love me.

716
00:46:42,549 --> 00:46:44,258
How did you know
what I was going to say?

717
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,594
Because I can read you.

718
00:46:46,720 --> 00:46:50,848
You love the crazy, the aging,
the sub-human Adam Stein.

719
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,266
Why is this?

720
00:46:52,392 --> 00:46:53,684
Why?

721
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:58,314
A healthy Adam Stein, for you,
not so attractive.

722
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:06,197
It's important that you know,
really know.

723
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:08,991
Makes no difference why,
but I do with all my heart.

724
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,202
Yes, you're a whore, and I use you.

725
00:47:11,328 --> 00:47:15,665
Now, listen, my landlady,
Ruthchen, the quiet type,

726
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:17,625
fucking her was like fucking butter.

727
00:47:17,751 --> 00:47:20,586
Fucking you is like
fucking the motorcycle.

728
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:24,048
You're cruel, darling.

729
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:27,552
Oh, Gina, Gina, 
it's a little humor.

730
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,680
Child, this is what saves everything.

731
00:47:30,806 --> 00:47:32,098
Klein knew it well.

732
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:34,308
You can weed out 
more sub-humans in a day

733
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,811
with humor and Zyklon B

734
00:47:36,937 --> 00:47:38,396
than you can with Zyklon B alone.

735
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:40,815
It's the combination.

736
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,442
Yeah.

737
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,196
Adam.

738
00:47:47,322 --> 00:47:48,364
What are you doing in there?

739
00:47:57,916 --> 00:48:00,793
Adam, you devil.

740
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,921
Well, it is Purim, after all,

741
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:07,049
and I can get another toothbrush.

742
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:10,845
Now, back to work.

743
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,431
We're almost done.

744
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:18,811
I still think he looks a little too- 
I don't know-

745
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:19,937
healthy.

746
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:22,398
Don't you think?

747
00:48:31,158 --> 00:48:33,868
Blacken the eye sockets,
for your Purim costume.

748
00:48:33,994 --> 00:48:37,079
Rex, hold still.

749
00:48:37,205 --> 00:48:38,164
And?

750
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,999
Oh yeah, of course, yeah, yeah.

751
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,250
Here we go, Rex.

752
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,460
Yeah, you're a prisoner.

753
00:48:42,586 --> 00:48:45,588
Look scared; he is the Kommandant.

754
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,506
Wonderful.

755
00:48:47,633 --> 00:48:52,345
A Purim to remember.

756
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:55,890
Kommandant, my family.

757
00:48:56,016 --> 00:48:58,809
You're a comfort, Adam...

758
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:01,187
a lifesaver.

759
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:05,483
Before you came, it was killing me.

760
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:10,112
Now it's better.

761
00:49:10,238 --> 00:49:12,156
Bravo.

762
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:15,368
Bravo, maestro.

763
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:25,795
Whoo!

764
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,171
Adam, Adam.

765
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:28,255
- Schwester.
- Adam?

766
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:33,010
You are looking today so very, 
very transcendent.

767
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:34,136
Thank you.

768
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:35,554
Tell me, have you been grooming

769
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:36,973
this little moustachio of yours?

770
00:49:37,099 --> 00:49:38,641
Oh, this is so becoming on a woman.

771
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:40,851
It's a very, very striking
kind of thing of course.

772
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,853
But do you not think it is a little warm

773
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:45,773
for the woolen Unterhosen?

774
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:46,941
Thank you.

775
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,859
Adam, I prayed for you to return,

776
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:50,152
and you did.

777
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:52,738
That was nice, Schwester,
bringing a man back into prison

778
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:55,574
when he's having such a swell time 
on the outside.

779
00:49:55,701 --> 00:49:56,993
L'Chaim, Schwester.

780
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,369
Mmm.

781
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,453
I accept your assignment.

782
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:03,082
I will be your holy ventriloquist.

783
00:50:03,208 --> 00:50:06,919
But just now, I have got to see
a man about a dog, shalom.

784
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:09,338
Woe be the shepherds of Israel
that feed themselves.

785
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,423
Auf Wiedersehen.

786
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:12,258
Shouldn't the shepherds feed the flocks?

787
00:50:12,384 --> 00:50:14,635
Good-bye.

788
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,972
I am so sorry that I just 
popped up before and ran off.

789
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:21,475
I got thirsty.

790
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:22,977
Did they torture you?

791
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:24,061
Who was it?

792
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,187
Golomb?

793
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:28,357
That tiny Torquemada 
with the jangling keys?

794
00:50:28,483 --> 00:50:31,360
Sturmfuehrer Slonim?

795
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:35,990
You can tell me.

796
00:50:36,116 --> 00:50:37,575
You're the only one that I can talk to

797
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,411
in this godforsaken place.

798
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,665
Yes, you are not a phony.

799
00:50:44,791 --> 00:50:48,586
And to me, this is a-
this is a very big deal.

800
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:52,131
Believe me, 
I can sniff one a mile away.

801
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:11,233
And so can you, can you not?

802
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:15,905
It is you and Adam Stein
against the world.

803
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:27,291
You and I, we are going to... 
take the trial run.

804
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:28,626
On we go.

805
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,628
Yes, I know you're a dog.

806
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:32,630
I understand.

807
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:34,715
There's nothing to be ashamed of.

808
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:45,810
Don't panic.

809
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:54,318
No, this is laundry, dirty laundry.

810
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,070
Yeah, let's take a little tour.

811
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:57,154
Oh, look who's here.

812
00:51:57,280 --> 00:52:00,491
Look who's coming.

813
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,618
Do you really think
this is doing the boy any good?

814
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:03,702
He's a dog, Gina.

815
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:04,829
Show a little respect.

816
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,080
- Come on.
- Hey.

817
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:09,917
Yeah, this is Gina Grey's classy ass.

818
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,001
Shoo.

819
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:13,170
Yeah, looky, look who's here.

820
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:18,008
Look at them, kid.

821
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:22,847
These- these wretched souls
have- have chimneys for hearts.

822
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:27,017
And Gross tries to heal them 
with, mescaline, LSD,

823
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:28,894
hypnotherapy.

824
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:30,271
Knows that it cannot be done.

825
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:31,772
And Seizling?

826
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:35,025
Yeah, she thought she could save 
these walking tombstones too.

827
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:36,694
Thought I could save them.

828
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,612
But I never said that I could.

829
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,823
I never promised them the burning bush.

830
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:42,408
Go away, Arthur.

831
00:52:42,534 --> 00:52:46,245
Go light a fire.

832
00:52:46,371 --> 00:52:48,122
How's the knitting, by the way?

833
00:52:48,248 --> 00:52:50,249
You're not the rebel you think you are.

834
00:52:50,375 --> 00:52:51,375
You know what?

835
00:52:51,501 --> 00:52:52,459
Look over there.

836
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:53,878
There's a man behind the curtain,

837
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,004
pulling your strings.

838
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,922
Yeah, I'm giving another talk tomorrow.

839
00:52:57,048 --> 00:53:00,217
A history of drama from the dawn of man 
till the present

840
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:02,720
entitled "Whisky and Dramaturgie".

841
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:06,182
Do try to come.

842
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:09,185
All right, are we all here?

843
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,269
Yes, we are.

844
00:53:10,395 --> 00:53:12,605
Then let's- let's begin.

845
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,482
Mm.

846
00:53:17,777 --> 00:53:19,570
A dog barks.

847
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:23,199
But a dog barking on a stage
is no longer a dog.

848
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,784
This bottle, for instance, I pour.

849
00:53:25,911 --> 00:53:28,913
I raise this glass to my mouth,
and I swallow.

850
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:29,997
Mm.

851
00:53:30,123 --> 00:53:32,041
But am I really drinking,

852
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,084
or am I a man playing a man
who is drinking?

853
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,502
Close your eyes.

854
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,546
Yeah, that's right.

855
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,423
Not so fast, Arthur.

856
00:53:39,549 --> 00:53:42,593
You've got to register first, please.

857
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,929
Name.

858
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,180
Schwester, you know my name.

859
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:49,600
Arthur, we all registered.

860
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:50,935
Name?

861
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,478
Arthur.

862
00:53:52,604 --> 00:53:53,604
Last name.

863
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,688
Fine.

864
00:53:54,814 --> 00:53:55,773
Arthur Fine.

865
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:57,733
Perfectly fine, Arthur.

866
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:59,151
Schwester, where was I?

867
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:01,403
"But am I really drinking, or am-"

868
00:54:01,529 --> 00:54:02,488
Exactly, folks.

869
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:05,366
We're all actors...

870
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:07,618
in a drama which both playwright

871
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:10,955
and director have long ago abandoned.

872
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:13,207
Nonetheless, meine sehr
verehrten Damen und Herren,

873
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,335
ladies and gentlemen, 
to bring the curtain down is impossible.

874
00:54:16,461 --> 00:54:18,087
The show must go on.

875
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,964
Hey, what's going on?

876
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:21,215
He's drunk.

877
00:54:21,341 --> 00:54:22,591
He's really drinking up there.

878
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:23,676
Adam, you're a liar.

879
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:25,719
Nonsense.

880
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:26,804
Nonsense, Arthur.

881
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,055
It is water.

882
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,723
You, of all people, should appreciate

883
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,434
what I'm trying to teach
these people, the artifice,

884
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:38,774
the necessary lie
that we all needed to survive.

885
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,151
Mm-hmm.

886
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:45,781
Here, here, here's a quick example.

887
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,992
Yeah.

888
00:54:48,118 --> 00:54:50,327
It is 1945.

889
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:51,412
It is dark.

890
00:54:51,538 --> 00:54:54,290
A man is running through the Naliboki Forest

891
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,000
with a cocktail?

892
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:58,627
A Molotov cocktail, yeah.

893
00:54:58,753 --> 00:55:00,713
The war is over,
but not everyone knows it yet.

894
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:03,173
Arthur Fine has been in the camps,

895
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,466
escaped,

896
00:55:04,592 --> 00:55:07,136
lived underground,
with the Bielski Partisans.

897
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,597
Yes, laughter.

898
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,517
For us, back there, no other way.

899
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:16,520
But then you came to Palestine,

900
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,564
this theater of the absurd.

901
00:55:18,690 --> 00:55:21,025
And for a while, 
you forgot the first rule of Dramaturgie.

902
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,860
You found a wife, a daughter.

903
00:55:22,986 --> 00:55:24,528
But it seems you were merely observing

904
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,739
the second law of Dramaturgie,
the pause,

905
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,657
because soon the fires burned again.

906
00:55:28,783 --> 00:55:30,075
Laughter sprang forth.

907
00:55:30,201 --> 00:55:32,369
You laughed as you set fire
to your house.

908
00:55:32,495 --> 00:55:33,454
No.

909
00:55:33,580 --> 00:55:35,039
Your wife, your little girl.

910
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,582
- Bastard.
- To yourself.

911
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:39,335
Then one day, Mrs. Seizling
showed up at the burn ward.

912
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,546
Fortunately, the Dachau number
on your arm was preserved,

913
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:47,217
and she recognized you
as one of her flock.

914
00:55:47,344 --> 00:55:51,472
You.

915
00:55:51,598 --> 00:55:52,890
Curtain.

916
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:56,894
Now, the point of this demonstration?

917
00:55:57,020 --> 00:56:03,859
Just as sadness creates tears,
so laughter creates the joy.

918
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,446
Don't look so horrified,

919
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,114
meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren,

920
00:56:09,240 --> 00:56:10,574
to laugh, yeah.

921
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,242
If I had not been able
to laugh back there,

922
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,369
I would be dead.

923
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:16,372
Me, you, all of us.

924
00:56:16,498 --> 00:56:19,917
And in room 285,

925
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:23,045
there sits a young mutt
who is laughing at us all.

926
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:24,129
What does he think,

927
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:25,464
he is better than the rest of us?

928
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:29,259
I will later give him some corrections.

929
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,928
Open your mouths.

930
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,012
Wide.

931
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,764
Wider.

932
00:56:33,890 --> 00:56:35,432
Relax the neck muscles.

933
00:56:35,558 --> 00:56:37,518
Wrinkle the noses.

934
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,103
Take a deep breath.

935
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,354
Perfect.

936
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:42,606
Ah.

937
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:43,899
And laugh.

938
00:56:44,025 --> 00:56:46,485
Ha, ha.

939
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,112
Louder.

940
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:49,905
Everyone.

941
00:56:50,031 --> 00:56:50,989
Louder, louder.

942
00:56:51,116 --> 00:56:52,408
What are you doing?

943
00:56:52,534 --> 00:56:54,284
- Louder, louder.
- What are you doing?

944
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:55,369
Everyone.

945
00:56:55,495 --> 00:56:56,829
I know that it hurts, yeah.

946
00:56:56,955 --> 00:56:57,955
No.

947
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,081
Look at me.

948
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,165
- I am burning.
- No.

949
00:57:00,291 --> 00:57:02,126
I am dying, but I can laugh.

950
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:03,377
No, stop it!

951
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,087
Stop laughing!

952
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,171
He's like a dog.

953
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:07,965
He's telling us what to do.

954
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,800
He licked his boot.

955
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,183
What do you want from me?

956
00:57:18,309 --> 00:57:19,852
All right, come here.

957
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:30,988
Let's get this dog collar off of you.

958
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:16,408
Intestinal bleeding, swollen limbs.

959
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:18,285
Acute renal failure, I knew it.

960
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:20,412
I knew it.

961
00:58:53,947 --> 00:58:56,823
Adam!

962
00:58:56,950 --> 00:58:58,158
Gretchen.

963
00:59:01,746 --> 00:59:03,372
- Papa.
- Oh, my dearest one.

964
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:04,456
Adam.

965
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:07,834
Try to find her.
Ruthie.

966
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:08,919
Adam.

967
00:59:09,045 --> 00:59:10,128
Please, Papa.

968
00:59:10,255 --> 00:59:11,547
I love you.

969
00:59:11,673 --> 00:59:12,798
Adam.

970
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,049
Play!

971
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,133
Play!

972
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:16,760
These people need some Marschmusik.

973
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:18,053
Play!

974
01:00:32,086 --> 01:00:36,340
What the hell is that?

975
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:56,985
Shut up.

976
01:00:57,111 --> 01:01:00,238
He's not dead, okay?

977
01:01:22,136 --> 01:01:26,056
It was Purim 1942. 

978
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:31,687
The SS were going door-to-door,
clearing out the ghetto.

979
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:36,441
My Naomi,
my beautiful little Naomi,

980
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:39,861
she was Queen Esther that year.

981
01:01:39,987 --> 01:01:44,074
I'd sewn her a dress
and made a crown from a tin can.

982
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:51,415
That night after services,
we snuck out.

983
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,583
The Nazis were a few blocks away,

984
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:57,462
so I knew we had some time.

985
01:01:57,588 --> 01:02:02,801
Just outside of the ghetto,
there lived a Mrs. Marshack.

986
01:02:02,927 --> 01:02:06,263
She used to bring me 
all her children's coats to mend.

987
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:10,267
And in her house,
there was a basement.

988
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:13,395
And under the basement,
there was another basement,

989
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:16,815
a pit with a trapdoor.

990
01:02:16,941 --> 01:02:22,279
Down that pit went my- my little queen.

991
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:27,617
As we left her there,
I could hear her whispering,

992
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:30,704
"Why, Daddy?"

993
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:43,800
13 months she was down there, Adam.

994
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,761
She was a child.

995
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,305
Her body had to grow,

996
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,682
and this crown,

997
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:54,728
she never took off this damned crown.

998
01:02:54,854 --> 01:02:59,524
That heartless, blind,
mute son of a bitch.

999
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,651
Why? 

1000
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:04,112
Why?

1001
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:13,330
Come on, you tyrant!

1002
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,456
Why?

1003
01:03:14,582 --> 01:03:15,540
Wolfowitz.

1004
01:03:15,666 --> 01:03:16,750
- Tell me why?
- That's enough.

1005
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:17,959
You're gonna hurt someone.

1006
01:03:18,085 --> 01:03:19,961
Tarshish.

1007
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:21,254
This is the point.

1008
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:22,339
Take me inside.

1009
01:03:22,465 --> 01:03:24,591
Let him let out some steam, please.

1010
01:03:24,717 --> 01:03:28,929
Let him- let him do it.

1011
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:31,973
Why, God?

1012
01:03:32,099 --> 01:03:34,142
Why? 

1013
01:03:34,268 --> 01:03:36,228
Why?

1014
01:03:41,108 --> 01:03:43,985
He misses you, Adam, the kid.

1015
01:03:44,111 --> 01:03:46,905
You know, he didn't really think
you were going to hurt him.

1016
01:03:47,031 --> 01:03:48,365
He told you that, did he?

1017
01:03:48,491 --> 01:03:51,952
Well, you tell him for me 
that he is better off without me.

1018
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:54,162
He was watching you type just now.

1019
01:03:54,288 --> 01:03:55,539
Tarshish, this is crap.

1020
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:57,916
No, Adam.

1021
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,876
Get away from me, please.

1022
01:04:00,002 --> 01:04:00,961
Wait, Adam.

1023
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,587
Tarshish, I am tired.
Leave me alone.

1024
01:04:02,713 --> 01:04:04,756
What in God's name?

1025
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:05,882
Don't tell anyone, okay?

1026
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:08,552
I'm counting on you.

1027
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:10,887
- No crazy stuff.
- Right.

1028
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:13,515
Wait, wait.

1029
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:25,735
Do not give me this look, kid.

1030
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,404
I was sick.

1031
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,197
I was dying.

1032
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:32,576
Kidney leaking with the white ashes.

1033
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:36,079
Oh, we're no good for each other, kid.

1034
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:41,793
Oh, this is not going to work.

1035
01:04:41,919 --> 01:04:45,255
What do you want, my Olivetti?

1036
01:04:45,381 --> 01:04:48,592
What, you saw me writing Wolfie's eulogy,

1037
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:50,176
now you want to write mine?

1038
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:53,930
That's, you know,
that's very intuit- intuitive.

1039
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,141
But let's not do it.

1040
01:04:56,267 --> 01:04:59,060
Do it on the paper.

1041
01:04:59,186 --> 01:05:00,145
Wait a minute.

1042
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,438
You're going to jam it.

1043
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:05,817
Here, I'll put it on the floor.

1044
01:05:05,943 --> 01:05:07,694
Try that out.

1045
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:13,909
Well, damn it, kid.

1046
01:05:14,035 --> 01:05:15,118
You're the little maestro.

1047
01:05:15,244 --> 01:05:17,203
Why the hell didn't you say so?

1048
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,747
Okay.

1049
01:05:18,873 --> 01:05:20,624
I can see that you're the sentient being,

1050
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,417
and sentient beings need what?

1051
01:05:22,543 --> 01:05:23,668
The name.

1052
01:05:23,794 --> 01:05:25,462
Here, maybe something that you're typing

1053
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:26,588
can give us an idea.

1054
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:28,131
Here, let me see.

1055
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:32,260
Ah, "fdg fdga". 

1056
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:33,887
Yeah, that has a mysterious ring to it.

1057
01:05:34,013 --> 01:05:38,850
But how about something
with a little symbolism?

1058
01:05:40,728 --> 01:05:42,604
You know who you remind me of?

1059
01:05:42,730 --> 01:05:43,980
David.

1060
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:45,398
David Rex.

1061
01:05:45,524 --> 01:05:48,109
Yeah, king of the Jews,

1062
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:52,322
descendant of Adam,
forebearer of the Messiah,

1063
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,615
musician, 

1064
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:55,158
fornicator,

1065
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:57,160
bloodthirsty warrior,

1066
01:05:57,286 --> 01:05:58,662
built Jerusalem,

1067
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:01,998
brought in God in this...

1068
01:06:02,124 --> 01:06:03,458
box.

1069
01:06:03,584 --> 01:06:04,668
Yeah.

1070
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:08,546
Long live Davey, king of dogs.

1071
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:12,217
Purim, our day of joy.

1072
01:06:12,343 --> 01:06:13,343
Bah.

1073
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,552
Look at that, Adam.

1074
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:17,180
They want us to dress up in costumes.

1075
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:20,725
He saved us from Haman
only to toss us to Hitler.

1076
01:06:20,851 --> 01:06:24,187
God's logic is not our logic,
Mr. Wolfowitz,

1077
01:06:24,313 --> 01:06:27,524
nor can we begin to fathom His ways.

1078
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:30,193
2,000 years we've stood face-to-face, 
Him and us.

1079
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:32,320
Then he turned and sicced Rex on us.

1080
01:06:32,446 --> 01:06:34,656
Still, you're a believer, Mr. Wolfowitz,

1081
01:06:34,782 --> 01:06:36,574
and Adam too.

1082
01:06:36,701 --> 01:06:37,993
And your tirades, gentlemen,

1083
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:41,913
are nothing but manifestos of faith.

1084
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:43,373
Schwester, this is very clever.

1085
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:44,708
- Did I say this?
- Of course.

1086
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:47,002
I write it all down.

1087
01:06:47,128 --> 01:06:48,169
Oy, soon, Adam-

1088
01:06:49,463 --> 01:06:52,007
Schwester, give him a-
throw him some scraps.

1089
01:06:52,133 --> 01:06:54,217
Ah, evolution is hard work.

1090
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:55,969
Oh, the little embryo is evolving

1091
01:06:56,095 --> 01:06:58,596
a million years at a time.

1092
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,140
Come on, we have got some work to do.

1093
01:07:00,266 --> 01:07:01,683
Writing, Adam?
What is he writing?

1094
01:07:01,809 --> 01:07:04,561
Poetry, poetry, Wolfie,
sheer unadulterated poetry.

1095
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:06,021
Blumers, Mrs. Lipowitz.

1096
01:07:06,147 --> 01:07:09,065
Stop by my- Adam's circus

1097
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:13,737
and see the miraculous offspring
of Olivetti und Rex.

1098
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:14,821
Heel.

1099
01:07:14,947 --> 01:07:15,905
Heel, come on, let's go.

1100
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,574
Adam.

1101
01:07:17,700 --> 01:07:19,242
No, no, no, heel, heel.

1102
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:20,910
Come on. Come on.

1103
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:24,748
David.

1104
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:29,419
Wait, Adam, me first.

1105
01:07:29,545 --> 01:07:34,090
We were in Mrs. Marshack's basement.

1106
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:39,637
13 months she was down there, Adam.

1107
01:07:39,764 --> 01:07:43,058
How much is that in numbers?

1108
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:46,102
13 months is, um-

1109
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:51,441
Well, it's 390 days, 9,360 hours.

1110
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:58,865
561,600 minutes she sat there...

1111
01:07:58,991 --> 01:08:01,785
waiting.

1112
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:03,453
Why, God?

1113
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:04,579
Why?

1114
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:12,212
"May his question soon be answered.

1115
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:16,841
Signed, Abe Wolfowitz."

1116
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:18,802
Then you say Kaddish, Adam,

1117
01:08:18,928 --> 01:08:22,388
and maybe serve some refreshments.

1118
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:28,978
You lived, right?

1119
01:08:29,105 --> 01:08:30,146
That's what matters.

1120
01:08:30,272 --> 01:08:32,190
Yeah, yeah.

1121
01:08:32,316 --> 01:08:35,276
The circus is here?

1122
01:08:36,695 --> 01:08:38,113
Yes, it sure is, come on.

1123
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:40,073
Come on, look how excited Rachel is.

1124
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:42,158
Come on, yeah, oh, everyone's come.

1125
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:43,326
Thank you. Thank you.

1126
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:44,410
Thank you, darling.

1127
01:08:44,537 --> 01:08:45,495
Thank you, Mr. Blum, yeah.

1128
01:08:45,621 --> 01:08:46,788
Come on, Arthur.

1129
01:08:46,914 --> 01:08:48,540
All right.

1130
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:50,083
Thank you.

1131
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,876
Do the reading outside.

1132
01:08:52,002 --> 01:08:57,549
Ah, ladies and gentlemen,
meine Damen und Herren.

1133
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:58,675
This is your big chance.

1134
01:08:58,801 --> 01:08:59,968
Ready?

1135
01:09:03,430 --> 01:09:08,977
I give you the king of dogs,
Koenig der Hund,

1136
01:09:09,103 --> 01:09:10,770
David.

1137
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:17,527
Bravo, bravo.

1138
01:09:31,500 --> 01:09:33,710
Messages from Davey.

1139
01:09:38,591 --> 01:09:39,591
For you.

1140
01:09:40,885 --> 01:09:41,885
What? 

1141
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:43,219
What?

1142
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:47,348
- What he is doing?
- "AT&T up 300 points."

1143
01:09:47,474 --> 01:09:49,559
Bravo, Adam.

1144
01:09:51,353 --> 01:09:53,730
He's speaking in tongues.

1145
01:09:53,856 --> 01:09:55,690
When, Adam, when?

1146
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,027
What?

1147
01:09:59,153 --> 01:10:02,739
He's been pounding out gibberish.

1148
01:10:02,865 --> 01:10:05,742
Nathan, we've been treating that boy 
for two months now,

1149
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:07,911
making our way through his defenses,

1150
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:10,747
and along comes Adam Stein
with a typewriter,

1151
01:10:10,873 --> 01:10:13,124
and you're beaming at me
like you've invented penicillin.

1152
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,126
Well, I'm sure Adam
will be more than delighted

1153
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:16,252
to share the credit.

1154
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:17,712
Nathan, please.

1155
01:10:17,838 --> 01:10:20,256
Adam is unstable.

1156
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:22,008
He's dangerous.

1157
01:10:22,134 --> 01:10:25,136
Instead of restricting him,
increasing his medication,

1158
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:27,931
you give him unlimited access
to the Institute.

1159
01:10:28,057 --> 01:10:30,266
You turn a blind eye to his alcohol,

1160
01:10:30,392 --> 01:10:32,101
his love affair with your head nurse.

1161
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:34,896
Read.

1162
01:10:35,022 --> 01:10:36,189
What do you mean, read?

1163
01:10:36,315 --> 01:10:39,859
Leave Adam to me.

1164
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:42,362
"Gina Grey's classy ass."

1165
01:10:46,200 --> 01:10:48,952
You know what?

1166
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,788
Why don't we just let the patients 
cure each other,

1167
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:55,583
and you and I can sit around
in our pajamas playing cards?

1168
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:59,754
That is the most sensible thing 
you've ever said.

1169
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:04,968
Oh, fine, fine, fine.

1170
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:06,135
That is my boy, David.

1171
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:08,554
This is my king of dogs.

1172
01:11:08,681 --> 01:11:10,848
Do not eat the-
do not eat the paper.

1173
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:14,143
Ow.

1174
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,728
Stop this.

1175
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:17,772
You are not a dog.

1176
01:11:17,898 --> 01:11:20,149
Do you know why I came back?

1177
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:23,778
I could have died, kid, yeah.

1178
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:25,905
The heart was blocked.

1179
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:28,658
Slonim was pounding my chest,
calling my name.

1180
01:11:28,784 --> 01:11:30,159
There was nothing else he could do.

1181
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:31,953
And I was wrestling with the Angel of Death.

1182
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:33,621
I stopped him at the gate.

1183
01:11:33,747 --> 01:11:35,123
Do you know why?

1184
01:11:35,249 --> 01:11:36,624
Huh?

1185
01:11:38,585 --> 01:11:40,795
To see you again.

1186
01:11:44,508 --> 01:11:47,510
That is why.

1187
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,345
I love you, child.

1188
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:50,596
But it's no damn good.

1189
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:55,184
You lean on me, 
we will both go tumbling down together.

1190
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:21,044
Zyklot 17.

1191
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:23,671
Rex would have preferred it that way, 
don't you think?

1192
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:26,966
When the Russians arrive,
they will shoot him like a dog.

1193
01:12:27,092 --> 01:12:28,051
Get up.

1194
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:30,762
I have something to show you.

1195
01:12:34,058 --> 01:12:36,184
Baron Von Hamdung.

1196
01:12:36,310 --> 01:12:37,560
Do you know the name?

1197
01:12:37,686 --> 01:12:40,605
Iron industry, shipping, petroleum.

1198
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,607
Not long after the war broke out,

1199
01:12:42,733 --> 01:12:45,234
he was accused of treason.

1200
01:12:45,361 --> 01:12:46,569
His entire estate,

1201
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:51,240
Swiss bank accounts, holdings,
were nationalized.

1202
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:56,412
A clever SS accountant-

1203
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:58,289
well, I thought I was clever
at the time-

1204
01:12:58,415 --> 01:12:59,916
was put in charge.

1205
01:13:00,042 --> 01:13:01,709
He was meticulous,

1206
01:13:01,835 --> 01:13:03,961
which is how he rose so fast
through the ranks.

1207
01:13:04,088 --> 01:13:08,049
But this one file, he put aside.

1208
01:13:08,175 --> 01:13:10,885
In fact, he stole it.

1209
01:13:11,011 --> 01:13:14,931
And incredibly, it was never missed.

1210
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:20,019
Patton's Third Army has crossed the Danube. 

1211
01:13:20,145 --> 01:13:23,439
The Russians are in Berlin.

1212
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:25,983
It's the end.

1213
01:13:26,110 --> 01:13:28,694
For me, this document is useless.

1214
01:13:28,821 --> 01:13:32,615
But we had a deal, you and I.

1215
01:13:32,741 --> 01:13:36,452
A life for a life.

1216
01:13:36,578 --> 01:13:37,870
So here.

1217
01:13:37,996 --> 01:13:39,872
It's Von Hamdung's last will,

1218
01:13:39,998 --> 01:13:42,125
the rights to his home and possessions,

1219
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:47,713
and you are the sole beneficiary.

1220
01:13:47,840 --> 01:13:50,633
You've been a good dog.

1221
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:06,524
The truth is,
I could have saved your family,

1222
01:14:06,650 --> 01:14:08,776
but it would have been inconvenient.

1223
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:12,822
I would have had some explaining to do.

1224
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:15,450
Do it.

1225
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:41,434
So there's life 
in the old clown yet, eh, Adam?

1226
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:28,856
Yeah, yeah, I get it.

1227
01:15:33,570 --> 01:15:35,696
Adam Stein is at home?

1228
01:15:49,836 --> 01:15:53,965
Herr, Hermann Lichtenstein.

1229
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,883
Rabbi.

1230
01:15:56,009 --> 01:15:58,678
Welcome to Valhalla.

1231
01:15:58,804 --> 01:16:01,430
Adam.

1232
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:03,057
Look at us.

1233
01:16:03,183 --> 01:16:05,101
How can it be?

1234
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,145
Oh, Rabbi.

1235
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:09,814
It is- it's only dynamite.

1236
01:16:09,940 --> 01:16:13,859
They're putting up an apartment block next door.

1237
01:16:13,986 --> 01:16:16,946
But on my land, 
no resurrection will occur.

1238
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:19,448
You have the word of Von Hamdung.

1239
01:16:19,575 --> 01:16:21,909
How did you find me?

1240
01:16:22,035 --> 01:16:25,454
The only Jew in Germany
should be hard to find?

1241
01:16:25,581 --> 01:16:29,083
You're in the papers, Adam,
the newsreels.

1242
01:16:32,462 --> 01:16:35,131
Let me ask you.

1243
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:39,927
Your daughter, the older one, Ruthie,

1244
01:16:40,053 --> 01:16:43,931
did you ever try to locate her?

1245
01:16:44,057 --> 01:16:46,350
Such a cheerful presence, Rabbi.

1246
01:16:46,476 --> 01:16:47,685
Truly, you light up the room.

1247
01:16:47,811 --> 01:16:48,978
I'm sorry, Adam.

1248
01:16:49,104 --> 01:16:50,187
But I have to.

1249
01:16:50,314 --> 01:16:51,314
She's dead.

1250
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:53,316
We both are.

1251
01:16:53,442 --> 01:16:54,734
What is the point?

1252
01:16:54,860 --> 01:16:57,486
But if you have to, what, know?

1253
01:16:57,613 --> 01:17:00,239
Yeah, I did.

1254
01:17:00,365 --> 01:17:03,618
For four years, I looked.

1255
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:09,290
I put Von Hamdung's blood money
to good use, believe me.

1256
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:11,876
Then it dawned on me, Rabbi.

1257
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:13,919
If she was alive,

1258
01:17:14,046 --> 01:17:17,173
then it was she
who was not looking for me.

1259
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,299
Adam.

1260
01:17:18,425 --> 01:17:20,509
She would be 25 this year.

1261
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:24,138
She would have heard about the antics 
of her famous father

1262
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:29,977
who was once a dog
and is now not much of anything.

1263
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:31,646
And who in the world could blame her

1264
01:17:31,772 --> 01:17:35,524
if she chose to be silent?

1265
01:17:35,651 --> 01:17:37,526
We survived.

1266
01:17:37,653 --> 01:17:39,487
It's not a crime.

1267
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:43,074
A crime is to blame yourself
instead of them.

1268
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:45,701
Now, listen to me.

1269
01:17:45,827 --> 01:17:48,663
She is alive.

1270
01:17:48,789 --> 01:17:50,665
She was in a holding camp after the war.

1271
01:17:50,791 --> 01:17:52,708
She married an Italian,

1272
01:17:52,834 --> 01:17:54,627
and last year,
they moved to Israel.

1273
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:55,753
Heinz.

1274
01:17:55,879 --> 01:17:57,880
She lives as a Christian in Haifa.

1275
01:17:58,006 --> 01:17:59,632
We were notified three weeks ago

1276
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:02,051
when she was admitted
to the Franciscan Hospital.

1277
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:04,887
They looked at her papers and contacted us.

1278
01:18:05,013 --> 01:18:06,555
Hospital?

1279
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:11,894
The Nazis, they injured her,
body and soul,

1280
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,397
but she lived.

1281
01:18:14,523 --> 01:18:17,316
And now, thank God,

1282
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:21,404
you are about to become a grandfather.

1283
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:25,157
I think it's time to talk to her.

1284
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:30,746
And if not to be forgiven,
then maybe at least to be heard.

1285
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:35,751
Rabbi, you have some nerve
coming here to my sarcophagus.

1286
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:38,045
Heinz, get my gun.

1287
01:18:41,675 --> 01:18:44,260
Her name and address,
should you so choose.

1288
01:18:44,386 --> 01:18:46,804
You don't have to punish yourself, Adam.

1289
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:49,098
Why stay in Berlin?

1290
01:18:49,224 --> 01:18:52,143
What's keeping you here?

1291
01:18:56,606 --> 01:18:59,900
You're not dead yet, Adam.

1292
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:11,287
It's so hot in here.

1293
01:19:11,413 --> 01:19:12,371
Why is it so hot?

1294
01:19:12,497 --> 01:19:13,581
It's a hothouse, Adam.

1295
01:19:13,707 --> 01:19:15,124
Hothouse in the desert, typical.

1296
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,876
What is he growing anyway?

1297
01:19:17,002 --> 01:19:22,089
Oh, melons, tomatoes,
herbs for the kitchen.

1298
01:19:22,215 --> 01:19:23,924
Hey.

1299
01:19:24,050 --> 01:19:31,807
Today you were thinking about Gretchen.

1300
01:19:31,933 --> 01:19:33,434
Oh, no, no.

1301
01:19:33,560 --> 01:19:34,894
Lady, this is not so nice.

1302
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:37,563
You have no right to be brooding 
about Gretchen.

1303
01:19:37,689 --> 01:19:39,982
That woman had faith in me.

1304
01:19:40,108 --> 01:19:42,276
Adam clowning around
as she took her final steps,

1305
01:19:42,402 --> 01:19:43,360
and she had faith in me.

1306
01:19:43,487 --> 01:19:44,487
You have faith in no one.

1307
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:45,654
I have faith in you.

1308
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:49,158
You are lying.

1309
01:19:49,284 --> 01:19:51,285
Don't, please.

1310
01:19:55,123 --> 01:19:58,209
No one's been able
to get through to him but you,

1311
01:19:58,335 --> 01:19:59,794
the poor child.

1312
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:00,878
It is not a child.

1313
01:20:01,004 --> 01:20:02,171
Do not call him the child.

1314
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:05,466
- Dog, he's a dog.
- He types on a typewriter.

1315
01:20:05,592 --> 01:20:07,218
He doesn't bark anymore.

1316
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:10,679
You, God, made him into a child.

1317
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:15,059
He was non-human; now he is human.

1318
01:20:15,185 --> 01:20:17,269
Wait a minute.

1319
01:20:24,194 --> 01:20:25,736
Are you jealous?

1320
01:20:25,862 --> 01:20:28,531
Why can't I be jealous?

1321
01:20:28,657 --> 01:20:30,783
Of course I'm jealous.

1322
01:20:30,909 --> 01:20:32,660
I'm jealous of the boy.

1323
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:34,954
I'm jealous of Gretchen.

1324
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:39,500
We used to be together so much before.

1325
01:20:39,626 --> 01:20:40,918
I used to bark for you.

1326
01:20:41,044 --> 01:20:42,753
I can still bark.

1327
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:49,844
You are not a-
you are not a dog.

1328
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:51,512
Gina.

1329
01:20:51,638 --> 01:20:52,805
Bitch at heart.

1330
01:20:52,931 --> 01:20:55,516
You- stop barking.

1331
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:57,017
Stop barking.

1332
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:03,399
You're not going to come between us.

1333
01:21:03,525 --> 01:21:06,735
This child is mine.

1334
01:21:06,862 --> 01:21:09,321
We are two dogs in the desert.

1335
01:21:09,447 --> 01:21:12,741
I took off his mask,
and now he wants my power.

1336
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,618
I cannot be the true dog.

1337
01:21:14,744 --> 01:21:16,161
Neither can he.

1338
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,581
He's a child.

1339
01:21:18,707 --> 01:21:20,291
He needs love.

1340
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:24,003
You had better not interfere.

1341
01:21:34,931 --> 01:21:35,931
Keep going, kid.

1342
01:21:36,057 --> 01:21:37,057
We are going to do this.

1343
01:21:37,183 --> 01:21:38,601
Marsch, hund.

1344
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:40,144
Come on, hey.

1345
01:21:40,270 --> 01:21:41,395
You see this fence?

1346
01:21:41,521 --> 01:21:42,897
You are going to grab onto the fence

1347
01:21:43,023 --> 01:21:44,023
and stand on your feet.

1348
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:45,107
This is all your fault.

1349
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:46,233
Everything I did for you,

1350
01:21:46,359 --> 01:21:47,651
and now for me,
you are going to do one thing.

1351
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:50,446
Here we go.
Stand.

1352
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:51,989
Oh.

1353
01:21:52,115 --> 01:21:53,282
Ah, hund, hund.

1354
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,784
Come on, schnell.

1355
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:58,037
Okay, you ever been to a circus, huh?

1356
01:21:58,163 --> 01:22:00,623
Bears, horses, lions,

1357
01:22:00,749 --> 01:22:03,208
every goddamn creature on this Earth.

1358
01:22:03,335 --> 01:22:05,628
Even Arthur Fine can stand on two feet.

1359
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:06,712
You're not the dog.

1360
01:22:06,838 --> 01:22:07,838
You're not the boy.

1361
01:22:07,964 --> 01:22:09,465
Come on, come on, come on.

1362
01:22:09,591 --> 01:22:10,841
David, David.

1363
01:22:10,967 --> 01:22:11,967
That's it, darling.

1364
01:22:12,093 --> 01:22:13,093
Do it. 

1365
01:22:13,219 --> 01:22:14,261
Do it.

1366
01:22:14,387 --> 01:22:15,971
David, yeah.

1367
01:22:16,097 --> 01:22:17,181
He's a boy, Adam.

1368
01:22:17,307 --> 01:22:19,308
He's a child.

1369
01:22:19,434 --> 01:22:20,935
I told you to leave us alone.

1370
01:22:21,394 --> 01:22:22,353
I warned you.

1371
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:23,604
So what are you?

1372
01:22:23,730 --> 01:22:25,022
Lizard?

1373
01:22:25,148 --> 01:22:26,357
Leech?

1374
01:22:26,483 --> 01:22:28,609
The little rat?

1375
01:22:28,735 --> 01:22:30,611
Okay.

1376
01:22:39,245 --> 01:22:41,497
Yes, okay.

1377
01:22:41,623 --> 01:22:42,831
Yeah.

1378
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:44,875
And stop.

1379
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:46,085
David, get down.

1380
01:22:46,211 --> 01:22:47,419
That is- that's enough.

1381
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:48,629
Oh, no, no, no, let him.

1382
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:49,755
He's making it.

1383
01:22:49,881 --> 01:22:51,382
Whore, leave me alone.

1384
01:22:51,508 --> 01:22:52,508
David.

1385
01:22:52,634 --> 01:22:54,176
David, yeah,
this is enough for one day.

1386
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:55,678
Down, down, down you go.

1387
01:22:55,804 --> 01:22:56,887
Down, please.

1388
01:22:57,013 --> 01:22:58,305
All right, no more.

1389
01:22:58,431 --> 01:22:59,390
I am not ready yet.

1390
01:22:59,516 --> 01:23:00,516
I cannot do it.

1391
01:23:00,642 --> 01:23:02,184
I'm dying.

1392
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:03,268
Please, please, please.

1393
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:04,353
Please.

1394
01:23:04,479 --> 01:23:05,521
Shut up.

1395
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:06,605
Look...

1396
01:23:06,731 --> 01:23:08,941
at me.

1397
01:23:09,067 --> 01:23:11,235
Look.

1398
01:23:11,361 --> 01:23:12,569
Look.

1399
01:23:37,012 --> 01:23:38,637
Come on, help me.

1400
01:23:38,763 --> 01:23:39,722
Okay, I got him.

1401
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:40,848
Let's go.

1402
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,269
This time you've gone too far, Adam.

1403
01:23:45,395 --> 01:23:46,729
- Too far.
- It's all right.

1404
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,356
It's okay; you made it.

1405
01:23:49,482 --> 01:23:51,900
You're a man,

1406
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:55,738
our man.

1407
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:37,029
David?

1408
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:38,864
Come on, kid.

1409
01:24:38,990 --> 01:24:40,949
You can do it.

1410
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:44,286
Come on.

1411
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:46,330
My God, Adam.

1412
01:24:52,504 --> 01:24:54,296
Come on, come on.

1413
01:24:54,422 --> 01:24:56,632
Oh, okay.

1414
01:26:09,497 --> 01:26:12,207
Go back to Europe, you old soap.

1415
01:26:32,478 --> 01:26:33,770
My name is Adam Stein.

1416
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:36,023
I'm looking for my daughter Ruthie.

1417
01:26:36,149 --> 01:26:37,149
Joe Gracci.

1418
01:26:37,275 --> 01:26:38,567
Oh, Joseph.

1419
01:26:38,693 --> 01:26:39,651
Come in, please.

1420
01:26:39,777 --> 01:26:42,029
Yeah, so nice to meet you.

1421
01:26:45,074 --> 01:26:46,575
Am I interrupting something?

1422
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:04,051
Would you like some coffee?

1423
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:11,475
I think you should leave now.

1424
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:13,268
Thank you very much for the flowers.

1425
01:27:13,394 --> 01:27:14,937
Outside, please.

1426
01:27:15,063 --> 01:27:16,480
Please, outside.

1427
01:27:16,606 --> 01:27:17,606
When?

1428
01:27:17,732 --> 01:27:18,941
When- when did she-

1429
01:27:19,067 --> 01:27:20,484
When?

1430
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:22,986
When she found out what you had done.

1431
01:27:23,112 --> 01:27:25,155
That's when she died for the first time.

1432
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:29,368
And then with every report that came in, 
she died again.

1433
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:32,412
The Commandant's pet, huh, wasn't it?

1434
01:27:32,538 --> 01:27:33,538
You, what, you played

1435
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:35,290
while your wife and your daughter

1436
01:27:35,416 --> 01:27:36,625
went to the ovens?

1437
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:38,210
Huh? And Ruthie?

1438
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:39,962
Do you even know what they did to her?

1439
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:41,088
Where is she?

1440
01:27:41,214 --> 01:27:42,172
Wherever she is right now,

1441
01:27:42,298 --> 01:27:43,340
she doesn't want you to be there.

1442
01:27:43,466 --> 01:27:45,342
I guarantee you that.

1443
01:27:45,468 --> 01:27:47,803
We know about you, Adam Stein.

1444
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:50,138
You lived on Nazi money in a Nazi mansion.

1445
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:51,223
I can find it.

1446
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:54,518
I can find the grave on my own.

1447
01:27:54,644 --> 01:27:55,978
Don't you dare.

1448
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:57,229
I'll take you.

1449
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,484
Spare a pfennig?

1450
01:28:02,610 --> 01:28:05,320
It's over there.

1451
01:28:05,446 --> 01:28:07,572
They bury them together
when they're that young.

1452
01:28:11,077 --> 01:28:13,245
A boy, by the way.

1453
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:24,298
You know, it's funny, I...

1454
01:28:27,844 --> 01:28:32,681
I never once saw her laugh.

1455
01:28:32,807 --> 01:28:33,807
A clown's daughter,

1456
01:28:33,933 --> 01:28:36,018
and she could barely break a smile.

1457
01:28:44,569 --> 01:28:47,571
So?

1458
01:28:47,697 --> 01:28:50,824
They say you were quite the performer 
back there, huh?

1459
01:28:54,162 --> 01:28:56,830
Now, go ahead.

1460
01:28:56,956 --> 01:29:00,334
Make her smile now.

1461
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,002
Go on, Dad.

1462
01:29:04,964 --> 01:29:09,551
Do something funny for your little girl.

1463
01:30:14,450 --> 01:30:17,619
<i>And so I found a home in the desert.</i>

1464
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:20,622
<i>Rebecca Seizling herself greeted me 
at her Institute.</i>

1465
01:30:20,748 --> 01:30:21,998
<i>And she looked me in the eye</i>

1466
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:25,544
<i>and knew that she had met
her prized puppy.</i>

1467
01:30:25,670 --> 01:30:27,421
<i>But the joke was on her.</i>

1468
01:30:27,547 --> 01:30:30,298
<i>I lived; she died.</i>

1469
01:31:15,636 --> 01:31:19,139
<i>A boy who is not a dog after all.</i>

1470
01:31:51,214 --> 01:31:54,925
Spare a pfennig?

1471
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:59,846
<i>Oh, ma- ha, yeah, ha.</i>

1472
01:31:59,972 --> 01:32:03,600
<i>Ruthie, do not be frightened.</i>

1473
01:32:03,726 --> 01:32:06,895
<i>Ah, my beautiful wife, Gretchen.</i>

1474
01:32:27,333 --> 01:32:30,710
Genug!

1475
01:32:30,836 --> 01:32:32,295
Purim?

1476
01:32:32,421 --> 01:32:33,713
You're celebrating?

1477
01:32:33,839 --> 01:32:37,467
Oh, Purim, on account of that 
one poor son of a bitch Haman?

1478
01:32:37,593 --> 01:32:39,135
What about the eight trillion tears?

1479
01:32:39,262 --> 01:32:40,887
Who is going to pay for those?

1480
01:32:41,013 --> 01:32:43,265
The eight trillion teeth and soap suds?

1481
01:32:43,391 --> 01:32:45,058
Skin and bones?

1482
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:47,519
The unfertilized sperm,
the unborn children,

1483
01:32:47,645 --> 01:32:50,188
the unwritten books,
the unrequited loves,

1484
01:32:50,314 --> 01:32:52,315
the unslept-in beds, huh?

1485
01:32:52,441 --> 01:32:54,109
You're the God who sends out Stormtroopers,

1486
01:32:54,235 --> 01:32:56,987
multiplies their brain cells,
makes them smarter than us?

1487
01:32:57,113 --> 01:32:59,239
No, I will show you show you
what we're celebrating.

1488
01:32:59,365 --> 01:33:01,992
Schwester, who are you?

1489
01:33:02,118 --> 01:33:03,201
Rachel Schwester.

1490
01:33:03,327 --> 01:33:04,369
No, hold up your arm.

1491
01:33:04,495 --> 01:33:07,455
What does it say?

1492
01:33:07,582 --> 01:33:08,957
Six, one, three, four, five.

1493
01:33:09,083 --> 01:33:12,252
Then who are you?

1494
01:33:12,378 --> 01:33:13,962
I'm six, one, three, four, five.

1495
01:33:14,088 --> 01:33:15,088
Yes.

1496
01:33:15,214 --> 01:33:16,172
Blum, you?

1497
01:33:16,299 --> 01:33:17,382
Two, four, two, two, five.

1498
01:33:17,508 --> 01:33:19,968
Yes, who are we, yeah?

1499
01:33:20,094 --> 01:33:22,137
The rest of you, roll up the sleeve.

1500
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:23,722
Raise those arms.

1501
01:33:23,848 --> 01:33:26,641
Zelda, she knew what she was doing 
all these years.

1502
01:33:26,767 --> 01:33:28,226
Smile, all of you.

1503
01:33:28,352 --> 01:33:29,311
It does not hurt.

1504
01:33:29,437 --> 01:33:30,687
It did; it does not anymore.

1505
01:33:30,813 --> 01:33:31,813
Arms straight up.

1506
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:37,235
We are this very night an army of arms.

1507
01:33:38,738 --> 01:33:39,696
Shout out your numbers.

1508
01:33:39,822 --> 01:33:42,574
Let him know that we are not dead.

1509
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:44,117
Sieben, sechs, drei, vier, fuenf.

1510
01:33:49,081 --> 01:33:50,248
Six, one, three, four, five.

1511
01:33:55,671 --> 01:33:57,464
Seven, one, three, oh, two.

1512
01:33:57,590 --> 01:34:00,508
Eight, four, two, nine, six.

1513
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:01,593
Seven, one, three, oh-

1514
01:34:04,347 --> 01:34:06,139
Seven, one, three, oh, two!

1515
01:34:06,265 --> 01:34:07,891
Seven, one, three, oh, two!

1516
01:34:08,017 --> 01:34:09,184
Show yourself. 

1517
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:10,644
Show yourself.

1518
01:34:51,936 --> 01:34:54,604
Show yourself.

1519
01:34:54,730 --> 01:34:57,774
Show yourself.

1520
01:34:57,900 --> 01:35:03,029
<i>Adam.</i> 

1521
01:35:03,155 --> 01:35:05,240
<i>Adam.</i>

1522
01:35:14,417 --> 01:35:16,668
On all fours, Adam.

1523
01:35:16,794 --> 01:35:19,087
It's funnier that way.

1524
01:35:22,925 --> 01:35:24,759
Adam Stein.

1525
01:35:24,885 --> 01:35:28,471
The funniest man in Germany.

1526
01:35:28,597 --> 01:35:30,640
Why are you here, Klein?

1527
01:35:30,766 --> 01:35:32,308
Did you really think

1528
01:35:32,435 --> 01:35:34,978
you could be rid of me so easily?

1529
01:35:35,104 --> 01:35:36,980
I have been here all along.

1530
01:35:37,106 --> 01:35:38,940
I am part of you.

1531
01:35:39,066 --> 01:35:41,317
Me you brought with you from Berlin.

1532
01:35:41,444 --> 01:35:44,320
Me you brought with you on the boat.

1533
01:35:44,447 --> 01:35:48,658
Me you carried into the desert
in your suitcase.

1534
01:35:48,784 --> 01:35:53,163
Adam.

1535
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:55,540
Adam.

1536
01:35:55,666 --> 01:35:57,167
What are you looking for, Adam?

1537
01:35:57,293 --> 01:35:58,501
Try and find her.

1538
01:35:58,627 --> 01:35:59,878
Ruthie?

1539
01:36:00,004 --> 01:36:03,131
You weren't much help to them,
were you?

1540
01:36:03,257 --> 01:36:05,216
Your wife and daughters.

1541
01:36:05,342 --> 01:36:08,344
I do not need you anymore.

1542
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:15,018
It is only you and me.

1543
01:36:15,144 --> 01:36:18,646
We're one and the same.

1544
01:36:23,486 --> 01:36:24,819
Adam.

1545
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:28,573
We have unfinished business.

1546
01:36:35,539 --> 01:36:38,333
Isn't it time for the curtain to come down?

1547
01:36:38,459 --> 01:36:42,003
Hasn't Adam's circus gone on long enough?

1548
01:36:42,129 --> 01:36:43,129
Now do it!

1549
01:36:49,345 --> 01:36:50,428
Do it. 

1550
01:36:50,554 --> 01:36:51,763
Do it.

1551
01:36:51,889 --> 01:36:53,848
And you'll be rid of me.

1552
01:36:53,974 --> 01:36:57,936
It's the only way.

1553
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:09,864
Do it.

1554
01:37:09,990 --> 01:37:11,741
Nein.

1555
01:37:11,867 --> 01:37:14,369
It is not.

1556
01:37:49,822 --> 01:37:51,364
I thought you left me.

1557
01:37:55,578 --> 01:37:59,455
I was here all the time.

1558
01:37:59,582 --> 01:38:02,208
You went away.

1559
01:38:07,423 --> 01:38:09,090
I'm back.

1560
01:38:37,328 --> 01:38:41,331
<i>Rebecca Seizling's Institute 
continues as before.</i>

1561
01:38:41,457 --> 01:38:44,709
<i>For Rachel Schwester, for Arthur, 
and for the rest,</i>

1562
01:38:44,835 --> 01:38:46,419
<i>life goes on.</i>

1563
01:38:46,545 --> 01:38:50,673
<i>Abe Wolfowitz, his prophecy,
however, did come true.</i>

1564
01:38:50,799 --> 01:38:52,550
<i>He died in his sleep</i>

1565
01:38:52,676 --> 01:38:55,386
<i>on the very night that he had predicted.</i>

1566
01:38:55,512 --> 01:38:57,639
<i>In the years since I left the Institute,</i>

1567
01:38:57,765 --> 01:39:01,851
<i>Gina Grey has not come once to Tel Aviv 
for the visit.</i>

1568
01:39:01,977 --> 01:39:06,773
<i>The moment I recovered,
Adam Stein was, for her, buried.</i>

1569
01:39:06,899 --> 01:39:14,197
<i>Dr. Nathan Gross, 
who had absolute faith in my recovery,</i>

1570
01:39:14,323 --> 01:39:17,158
<i>him I will miss.</i>

1571
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:26,668
<i>David was released that winter
into the custody of a relative.</i>

1572
01:39:26,794 --> 01:39:29,462
<i>Gross has assured me that this relative</i>

1573
01:39:29,588 --> 01:39:34,550
<i>is the upstanding citizen,
the family man,</i>

1574
01:39:34,677 --> 01:39:39,889
<i>someone who can give the boy
the life that I cannot.</i>

1575
01:39:40,015 --> 01:39:43,935
<i>I miss him, my Davey.</i>

1576
01:39:44,061 --> 01:39:45,603
<i>He writes to me.</i>

1577
01:39:45,729 --> 01:39:46,980
<i>I follow his progress,</i>

1578
01:39:47,106 --> 01:39:49,482
<i>and I will visit him soon.</i>

1579
01:39:49,608 --> 01:39:53,236
<i>But he has a life now,
his own life,</i>

1580
01:39:53,362 --> 01:39:57,657
<i>and a home in which to grow up.</i>

1581
01:39:59,243 --> 01:40:03,246
<i>As for me, I have become...</i>

1582
01:40:03,372 --> 01:40:05,999
<i>the ordinary man.</i>

1583
01:40:06,125 --> 01:40:10,586
<i>I returned to Ruth Edelson's pension.</i>

1584
01:40:10,713 --> 01:40:12,922
<i>I could no longer give myself diseases</i>

1585
01:40:13,048 --> 01:40:15,258
<i>nor bring about my own end.</i>

1586
01:40:15,384 --> 01:40:18,803
<i>I no longer carry Klein inside me.</i>

1587
01:40:20,723 --> 01:40:24,308
<i>I live in a lovely valley,</i>

1588
01:40:24,435 --> 01:40:27,854
<i>but the heights are gone forever.</i>

1589
01:40:27,980 --> 01:40:30,982
<i>There are no more frightful deserts,</i>

1590
01:40:31,108 --> 01:40:34,277
<i>and I no longer leap into the fire.</i>

1591
01:40:34,403 --> 01:40:36,946
<i>I am afraid that I will get burned.</i>

1592
01:40:37,072 --> 01:40:42,201
<i>Sanity is pleasant and calm,</i>

1593
01:40:42,327 --> 01:40:47,415
<i>but there is no greatness,
no true joy,</i>

1594
01:40:47,541 --> 01:40:53,129
<i>nor the awful sorrow
that slashes the heart.</i>
