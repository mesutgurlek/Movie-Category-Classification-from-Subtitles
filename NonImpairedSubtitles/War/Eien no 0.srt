00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:17,910
<Funeral of Ooishi Matsuno>

2
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,466
Dad
Grandpa

3
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,813
Grandpa really cried his heart out.

4
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:58,023
That was my first time seeing him cry so hard.

5
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:03,450
That is because your grandfather really loved your grandmother.

6
00:02:04,499 --> 00:02:09,368
Grandma really had a happy fulfilling life.

7
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,129
But Grandma had a hard time during the war,

8
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:15,673
Like her ex-husband dying as a Special Attack Force.

9
00:02:16,428 --> 00:02:18,635
Yup.
Ex-husband?

10
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:23,014
Wait a moment. That was my first time hearing that!

11
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,349
Really?

12
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,010
What do you mean by "really"?

13
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,356
He is my biological father.

14
00:02:31,902 --> 00:02:32,891
Eh?

15
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:53,961
Yes.

16
00:02:54,049 --> 00:02:56,711
Why are you even sleeping in till this time of the day?

17
00:02:56,802 --> 00:03:00,966
Is that even right for a person of your age to be doing that still?

18
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:03,889
Shut up! What do you want?

19
00:03:04,393 --> 00:03:07,351
Remember the talk about Grandma's ex-husband?

20
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:08,677
Do you want to investigate that?

21
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:09,511
Eh?

22
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,840
That talk that we had!

23
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,720
Mum said she is also curious about that.

24
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:18,563
She didn't come to me about that. Why don't you do it instead.

25
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:21,941
What are you even saying you silly fool.

26
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:25,194
This is our real biological Grandpa that we are talking about here.

27
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,243
Ain't you interested?

28
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:27,286
I am sorry,

29
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:29,573
But I am not buying that.

30
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,917
The next year will be the 60th anniversary for the end of WWII

31
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:34,745
If we were to pursue this, maybe we can even publish a book!

32
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:36,128
Are you listening to me?

33
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,715
I don't want to end my career with just being a freelance writer.

34
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:39,917
Please help me!

35
00:03:40,429 --> 00:03:42,715
So that is your aim!

36
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,922
You can go work something out on your own. I am hanging up.

37
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,597
Wait! wait, wait, wait!

38
00:03:46,685 --> 00:03:48,471
I will pay you for this.

39
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:54,522
<Ooishi>

40
00:03:57,529 --> 00:03:59,611
Still the same I see, Grandpa.

41
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,318
You do have a lot of non-profitable cases.

42
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:08,112
In society, a lawyer is expected to be a very profitable profession though.

43
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:11,119
Are you going to be one?

44
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:16,461
As expected.

45
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:22,092
After being rejected for 4 years straight, I gotta re-think about it.

46
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:25,634
Like if I really suited to take the bar exam.

47
00:04:26,224 --> 00:04:28,715
Well, my resolve is weak I supposed.

48
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,552
I thought I would be able to be like Grandpa...

49
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:33,637
Right?

50
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,474
I say Kentaro,

51
00:04:37,903 --> 00:04:40,815
You are not here to ask about that right?

52
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:45,320
You are the one who said "Grandpa might be against it" thus you don't want to investigate further.

53
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,859
Investigate?

54
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:52,330
Ah..yah.

55
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:56,827
I see.

56
00:04:57,464 --> 00:05:02,174
I don't like to be investigating this in secret.

57
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,879
No.

58
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,345
I want you to investigate this.

59
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,506
Eh?

60
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,801
It is for your sake too.

61
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:19,558
Miyabe Kyuuzou.
Born in 1918, Tokyo.

62
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,436
Joined the Navy Air Service in 1934.

63
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:26,399
Died in the battle of Okinawa in 1945.

64
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,827
Yup. And he also never left a will.

65
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,492
There was barely any trace of his life.

66
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:39,030
He married Grandma in 1941, and Mum was born in the following year.

67
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:41,709
But their marriage life was only 4 years,

68
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:44,549
And during that period he was almost always on the battlefield.

69
00:05:45,136 --> 00:05:47,627
He was 26 when he died.

70
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:49,967
26?

71
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,473
He is the same age as you are now.

72
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:56,386
What's with that?

73
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,776
This is impossible.

74
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:09,150
When there is a gap of 60 years in the generation, it became impossible to read the writing.

75
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:10,613
So what's up with this?

76
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:16,760
Hurm? Ah, I tried finding a few comrades online and wrote to them if they know who is Miyabe Kyuuzou.

77
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,410
And these are the replies.

78
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,631
Eh... that many?

79
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:25,418
Yup.

80
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:47,772
Excuse me Hasegawa san, but do you know my grandfather?

81
00:06:49,784 --> 00:06:51,149
Yes I do.

82
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:58,180
Well, we are trying to find out what kind of a person our grandfather is.

83
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:16,183
He is the biggest coward in the Navy Air Service.

84
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:18,301
Eh?

85
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,898
A person who views his life with utmost importance.

86
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,693
What does that mean?

87
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,234
In short.

88
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:33,325
He is obsessed about staying alive.

89
00:07:40,335 --> 00:07:44,704
We, pilots, all gave our lives to the nation.

90
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:55,676
But this Miyabe Kyuuzou, he is different from all of us.

91
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:01,940
Rather than winning, his guy's only wish is to keep his own life.

92
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:11,526
Even when I lost my arm, his plane made it back safely without a single scratch.

93
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:14,198
Not a single bullet pierced through it.

94
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:22,060
In those chaotic fights, that is impossible!

95
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,298
That guy did not carry through his mission.

96
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,217
He laid hidden in somewhere faraway.

97
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:46,148
I beg your pardon, but my grandfather died as a Special Attack Force right?

98
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,680
It is a little weird to say such a person is a coward...

99
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,275
If it is that guy,

100
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:57,985
It must have been an order from the uppers and he went with tears.

101
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:06,320
The talk of the town menu in this shopping district is this!

102
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,170
Did something happened?

103
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,480
Mum...

104
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:17,840
Did you ever ask about Miyabe san?

105
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,510
Yes. I did.

106
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:31,526
"What kind of a person is he?" I asked.

107
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:33,394
And?

108
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:39,193
Your Grandma just smiled and did not tell me anything.

109
00:09:41,456 --> 00:09:46,541
Well it may be because the marriage wasn't a blessed one.

110
00:09:48,838 --> 00:09:55,084
If...if that Miyabe san did not have a very good reputation?

111
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,052
Is that so?

112
00:09:58,139 --> 00:10:01,176
No, I meant "if".

113
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,340
Since we are going to investigate about him, what if such stuff were revealed?

114
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:14,687
Since she had never talked to me about him, it might be the case.

115
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:23,325

He was known to be "the disgrace of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service".

116
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,865
He was always running away in the skies.

117
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:35,370
He was responsible for the sacrifice of several bombers for his negligence in guarding them.

118
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,860
Let's go.

119
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,537
Well, my grandfather...

120
00:11:07,876 --> 00:11:11,539
Miyabe san was a coward right?

121
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,754
Where did you hear that from?

122
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:19,627
Everyone has been saying that... that he was such a disgrace.

123
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:26,174
Please leave.

124
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,974
I have nothing to say to you.

125
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:35,729
Wait a moment.

126
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:38,395
I told you to get out of here!

127
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,321
Just think about it.

128
00:11:44,829 --> 00:11:49,619
If Miyabe was a coward, why did he join the Special Attack Unit?

129
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:04,091
You want to quit?

130
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:09,480
But right from the start, every uncle has been saying the same things.

131
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:12,930
"Coward", "Timid", "Fear of dying".

132
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:15,474
And in the end, even "Disgrace" was mentioned.

133
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:19,319
So I thought  why not just say what they have been saying, but I was yelled at instead.

134
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:22,189
We are on our way to another interview, so just what are you saying!

135
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:28,324
That's why I say, this shall be the last I am going with you!

136
00:12:30,667 --> 00:12:32,658
Ah....

137
00:12:33,544 --> 00:12:36,752
Inheriting the bloodline of such person...

138
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,134
"Coward"...

139
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:50,850
It's true that that's what all those old guys are calling him.

140
00:12:50,979 --> 00:12:54,062
But that can't be help.

141
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:04,480
They bothered Platoon Sergeant because of his good skills of navigating a fighter plane.

142
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,658
His skills were good?

143
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:12,497
His skills were the best of the best.

144
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,328
If such a person is in the platoon,

145
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:25,330
He will be expected to led the way head on with the enemy and shoot them all down.

146
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:25,700
Escaping to the higher skies to see further.

147
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:32,520
But what Platoon Sergeant did was to just swerve away.

148
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,260
Right at the start of the battle in the air,

149
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:43,528
Escaping to the higher skies to keep a lookout.

150
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:49,701
He hates to be involved in the waging war,

151
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,781
And that is the cause of the malicious rumors.

152
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,913
Ah...

153
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,544
Do you know anything about the Zero fighters?

154
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:04,917
Ah.. I don't really know.

155
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,240
The Zero fighter...

156
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:17,720
Is really a great plane.

157
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:23,220
It is able to turn sharp angles and maintain fast speed.

158
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:26,390
It is well equipped with weapons too.

159
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:31,823
Thanks to that it is able to fly long distances.

160
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:38,208
In that time when other planes are only able to do a few hundred kilometers,

161
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:47,418
But a Zero fighter can do 1800 miles, about 3000 kilometers easily.

162
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:53,040
When the Zero fighter is paired up with Platoon Sergeant,

163
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:57,928
They can be said that they are almost invincible.

164
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,854
But even then,

165
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:10,027
Everyone still gather and gossip and made him to be a coward.

166
00:15:10,118 --> 00:15:12,484
Well, I supposed that can't really be helped.

167
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,667
No. 66! Wheels ready, hook ready.

168
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,247
Landing!

169
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,454
No. 66! Landing!

170
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,915
It's coming, It's coming!

171
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,875
Here it is!!

172
00:16:30,031 --> 00:16:33,694
The real landing on a carrier is different from the training on land.

173
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:36,738
Landing on the choppy waters is like riding a wild horse.

174
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:42,578
No. 68, wheels ready, hook ready. Landing!

175
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,042
No. 68! Landing!

176
00:17:03,064 --> 00:17:04,554
Landed!

177
00:17:05,107 --> 00:17:06,768
That is some feat!

178
00:17:06,901 --> 00:17:09,108
That guy is no. 12 right.

179
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,915
Have you ever landed on other carriers before?

180
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,420
No, this is my first time landing,

181
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,294
But I followed what the previous pilot had taught and am able to do it.

182
00:17:33,094 --> 00:17:37,133
I am Master Sergeant Miyabe Kyuuzou. Please take care of me.

183
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,053
I am First class Airman Izaki.

184
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,689
Hey.

185
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:56,189
If you admire Miyabe's skills, you will only be disappointed later.

186
00:17:56,576 --> 00:18:01,161
He is the No.1 coward in the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service.

187
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:04,037
And his pet phrase is "treasure your life".

188
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:12,672
After that we had more vigorous training.

189
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:19,011
There are no rest days even on Saturdays and Sundays too.

190
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:24,138
At that point in time, the capability of the us, 1st Air Fleet

191
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:30,315
Without a doubt, is the first in the world.

192
00:18:31,402 --> 00:18:35,987
Because we got the best fighters in the world,

193
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:41,488
Coupled with the best pilots in the world.

194
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:50,280
And on top of that, Platoon Sergeant's abilities are even better than the rest of the group.

195
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:58,710
And in no time, the battle that will test such skills started.

196
00:18:59,388 --> 00:19:02,880
The start of the Pacific War,

197
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:06,391
Attack on Pearl Harbor.

198
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:23,363
Fighters in position ready!

199
00:21:06,807 --> 00:21:12,643
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

200
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:15,475
And then...

201
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,982
After leaving Barbers Point Beach, we can see Ford Island.

202
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,441
We headed for the battleships that were parked idily,

203
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,489
And the Special Attack Unit from the Navy Air Service launched the admirable attack!

204
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:27,609
Sending torpedoes one after another.

205
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,278
Boom!

206
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:38,461
Really! We saw USS Arizona exploding!

207
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:41,129
And fumes of black smoke rose up!

208
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,837
Just like a volcano!

209
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:50,927
Master Sergeant Miyabe!

210
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,642

It's you Izaki.

211
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:58,063
Why are you pulling such a long face? Are you not happy?

212
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:05,313
There were no carriers in sight.

213
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:10,193
I think the battle today is a failure if we failed to attack the carriers.

214
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:17,204
On top of that, there were also 29 planes that did not make it back.

215
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:22,871
Today...

216
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,627
I saw a bomber that dived into the sea.

217
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:33,970
In that instant, 3 lives were lost.

218
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:38,892
It is scary.

219
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,693
I do not wish to die.

220
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:52,326
What are you saying!

221
00:22:53,440 --> 00:23:03,830
At that moment, I was very disgusted with the words "I do not wish to die" that Platoon Sergeant had said.

222
00:23:05,134 --> 00:23:10,094
And what Platoon Sergeant had been worrying about,

223
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:14,173
The fact that we did not sink any carriers,

224
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:19,103
Took a terrible turn on the following year on 5th of June.

225
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:23,432
We were hit by their sudden attack.

226
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:30,193
That was the Battle of the Midway.

227
00:23:49,595 --> 00:23:51,460
Heave-ho!

228
00:23:52,056 --> 00:23:55,719
Haven't they found the enemy's carrier yet?

229
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:59,142
Could they have ran away in fear of us?

230
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,729
Look at the bombers.

231
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,309
The torpedoes are useless in this situation.

232
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:11,443
They decided that there wouldn't be carriers in the sky.

233
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,362
Enemy battle fleet sighted.

234
00:24:18,499 --> 00:24:20,660
Change all land use bombs for torpedoes.

235
00:24:20,834 --> 00:24:22,495
We just finished dismounting!

236
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:23,993
They are too willful!

237
00:24:24,088 --> 00:24:25,828
Didn't you hear that?!

238
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:28,547
Return the torpedoes once more! On the double!

239
00:24:28,676 --> 00:24:29,882
Understood!

240
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,839
There is no time to be doing this!

241
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:36,430
If the carrier is sighted we have to go immediately!

242
00:24:36,510 --> 00:24:39,180
But if we are using land use bombs, we will not be able to sink the carrier!

243
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,760
It doesn't matter if we can't sink them. We just have got to attack first!

244
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:43,920
But if that is the case, we should just aim to sink them right from the start.

245
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,560
If that is the case, why change the torpedoes to land use bombs?!

246
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,230
If our aim is the carriers,

247
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,850
The torpedoes should have been left as it is and wait for the announcement for spotting the carriers.

248
00:24:52,658 --> 00:24:57,277
If we were to be attacked, we will be helpless!

249
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,950
Combat air patrol pilots, to the deck immediately!

250
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,047
Good luck!

251
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,049
I'm off!

252
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:13,652
Yes! They hit it!

253
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:19,116
It is falling!

254
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:20,947
Yes!

255
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,455
Starboard!

256
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:45,804
Yes!

257
00:26:45,896 --> 00:26:48,012
Good job!

258
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:51,811
Hey! Enemy aircraft descending from above!

259
00:27:21,515 --> 00:27:23,927
Evacuate! Evacuate!

260
00:27:38,448 --> 00:27:40,530
A decoy?!

261
00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:32,204
That is what I saw of the Battle of Midway.

262
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:42,552
Having lost our carrier, we made emergency landing on the sea.

263
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:46,927
We were later taken in by the destroyers' cutters.

264
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:49,425
Dad, let's stop around here.

265
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,555
Yes, you need a rest...

266
00:28:51,647 --> 00:28:55,936
No, I still have things I need to say.

267
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,442
In the summer of 1942.

268
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:06,859
We returned once to the main land,

269
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:11,994
And were sent off to Rabaul.

270
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:21,620
This was where the best of the best pilots of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service could be found.

271
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,094
The well known pilots of Rabaul.

272
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:31,888
Shortly, Miyabe san got promoted to be a Platoon Sergeant.

273
00:29:31,940 --> 00:29:41,480
Whereas me and a guy called Koyama got assigned to be his 2nd and 3rd pilots.

274
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:42,773
Izaki!

275
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,032
How can you even stand that Platoon Sergeant!

276
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,700
Always flying upside down.

277
00:29:52,833 --> 00:29:57,122
But the bottom of a fighter is our blind spot. He is just being cautious I guess.

278
00:29:57,212 --> 00:30:01,171
Even if so he is doing too much! That is becoming the butt of a joke.

279
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:09,129
Serving under that guy is an order from the uppers.

280
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,885
There is no helping to it!

281
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:15,265
Thanks to that, whenever the fight became chaotic, we are the first to leave.

282
00:30:17,149 --> 00:30:20,687
I want to fight the Americans!

283
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:26,363
And also that habit of being obsessed with little details.

284
00:30:26,450 --> 00:30:29,362
Even raising a big ruckus when the engine is a little off.

285
00:30:29,578 --> 00:30:32,320
When I am accelerating and decelerating, the vibrations are not right.

286
00:30:32,414 --> 00:30:35,201
Please perform a maintenance check through carefully once more.

287
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:35,951
Yes.

288
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:38,705
Even the maintenance crew are fuming at him.

289
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:49,233
Platoon Sergeant, you are doing this kind of training daily?!

290
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:50,939
Yeah.

291
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,192
Even on days we have to fly?

292
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:54,989
Yeah.

293
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,864
Why to such extents?

294
00:32:04,131 --> 00:32:07,123
They took this at a studio and sent it to me.

295
00:32:09,219 --> 00:32:10,834
My wife and my daughter.

296
00:32:12,139 --> 00:32:17,475
Whenever I think that "it's tough, I want to give up", I would look at this.

297
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:23,059
Even if I alone die, it will not make a difference to the war.

298
00:32:23,650 --> 00:32:30,317
But the lives of my wife and daughter will be affected greatly.

299
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,980
That is why to me, being able to live and return is the utmost importance.

300
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:46,203
You treasured your life to that extent?

301
00:32:50,640 --> 00:33:02,010
To survive and return, such speech from Platoon Sergeant is unthinkable in that age of time.

302
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:12,770
Well if you are not living at that era, you might not be able to understand such feelings though...

303
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:18,239
That is to say,

304
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:29,290
My grandfather really loved my grandmother, right?

305
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:31,664
Yes.

306
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:39,257
We do not speak of love,

307
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:43,620
but Platoon Sergeant, for the sake of his wife and daughter

308
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:50,430
Spoke clearly and strongly of how he had wanted to survive and return.

309
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:54,480
In our era, that is unmistakably,

310
00:33:55,408 --> 00:34:00,368
The same as saying "I love you".

311
00:34:08,672 --> 00:34:11,880
So he is not just a coward.

312
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:21,090
But in a short while, a battle that is hard to determine the fate of our lives started.

313
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:31,680
The biggest battlefield of the Pacific war that plagues the islands of Guadalcanal and Solomon islands

314
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:41,450
The Imperial Japanese Navy sent out the best pilots and those who took part in Pearl Harbour attacks,

315
00:34:41,538 --> 00:34:45,247
Resulting in the lost of most pilots.

316
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:52,462
Everyone! Gather again at the command post!

317
00:34:52,549 --> 00:34:56,462
The air attack on Rabi is canceled. We are heading for new targets!

318
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:07,100
Even if they are called cowards, the Allied waited for our airbase to be built,

319
00:35:09,316 --> 00:35:14,652
They attacked upon its completion, wiping out that little forces are left,

320
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:17,604
Taking over the airbase!

321
00:35:19,409 --> 00:35:20,990
And we, from now on,

322
00:35:21,953 --> 00:35:26,322
Will carrying out a bomb attack on Guadalcanal's land forces.

323
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,789
This shall also be an attack to show our condolences.

324
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:31,743
The end.

325
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,499
Salute.

326
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,168
At ease.

327
00:35:38,386 --> 00:35:40,843
Dismiss!
Roger!

328
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:46,516
270 miles to Shortland Islands.

329
00:35:46,645 --> 00:35:48,681
540 miles.

330
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,013
20...

331
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,350
560 miles?

332
00:35:55,403 --> 00:35:58,611
This is impossible. We can't fight with this distance!

333
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:05,452
Miyabe, what did you just say?

334
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,239
Why are you always saying such things?

335
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:11,199
Get yourself together!

336
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:17,376
You are demoralizing the troop! Don't you dare say that again!

337
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,223
Platoon Sergeant! Why did you say such things!

338
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:35,690
In the first place,

339
00:36:35,777 --> 00:36:37,563
Does Platoon Sergeant know anything about Guadalcanal?

340
00:36:37,654 --> 00:36:42,148
I don't, but I know what does 560 miles translate to.

341
00:36:43,576 --> 00:36:45,407
We can only reach there in 3.5 hours.

342
00:36:45,537 --> 00:36:48,404
And this 3.5 hours includes being on the look out for enemies.

343
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,909
Taking into consideration the fuel you need to come back,

344
00:36:51,126 --> 00:36:54,744
Fighting in the skies of Guadalcanal is probably a mere 10 mins.

345
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,963
I can imagine what kind of a fight it will become.

346
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:08,716
Just as what Platoon Sergeant had said.

347
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:00,767
What's up?

348
00:38:04,574 --> 00:38:05,984
I am going back!

349
00:38:06,201 --> 00:38:07,987
Going back to do a suicide bombing?

350
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,575
No!

351
00:38:14,501 --> 00:38:15,786
Stop!

352
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,591
Platoon Sergeant...

353
00:38:52,831 --> 00:38:54,037
Yes!

354
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,217
Damn it!

355
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:44,584
I will seek for emergency help right away! Do what you can and endure!

356
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,754
Koyama! Hang in there!!

357
00:40:11,784 --> 00:40:16,699
There is no sign of Staff Sergeant Koyama at the landing spot.

358
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:22,037
What happened?

359
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,161
At the landing spot,

360
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,794
There were sharks swimming about.

361
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:43,813
Platoon Sergeant!

362
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,275
Why did you not let him perform a suicide bombing!?

363
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,486
Rather than being eaten by sharks,

364
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:55,230
Koyama would definitely feel happier dying courageously in a head on with the enemies!

365
00:40:56,329 --> 00:40:58,820
At that time there was still a chance that he could have been saved.

366
00:40:58,950 --> 00:41:00,880
Do you seriously think that he could be saved?!

367
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,180
I don't know!
Do you seriously think that he could be saved?!

368
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:02,190
I don't know!

369
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:05,410
But if he did a suicide bombing, he would have definitely died.

370
00:41:05,505 --> 00:41:09,418
You can die anytime, but it takes effort to live on.

371
00:41:09,509 --> 00:41:10,794
Anyway,

372
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:15,336
There is no chance that we will survive this war.

373
00:41:16,933 --> 00:41:18,969
If I were shot down,

374
00:41:19,769 --> 00:41:21,509
Please just let me do a suicide bombing!

375
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,387
Izaki, you still don't get it?!

376
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:27,014
Don't you have family?

377
00:41:27,235 --> 00:41:30,227
Don't you have people who will feel sad for you if you die?

378
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:33,404
Answer me Izaki!

379
00:41:38,538 --> 00:41:41,951
I still have my father and mother back in my hometown.

380
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,698
Only that?

381
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:47,369
I also have a brother.

382
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:50,959
Will your family not feel sad if you die?

383
00:41:55,555 --> 00:41:56,761
No...

384
00:41:58,224 --> 00:42:00,215
Then don't die!

385
00:42:00,810 --> 00:42:05,395
No matter how hard it is, put in effort to continue living!

386
00:42:07,734 --> 00:42:09,975
Before and after that,

387
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:16,406
That was the only time that I had a scolding from Platoon Sergeant.

388
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:25,740
That's is why his words had stayed deep inside my heart until now.

389
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:36,960
The words of Platoon Sergeant kept me going in an incident after I have left Rabaul.

390
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:46,050
In 1944, at the Battle of the Philippine Sea, a Grumman lying in ambush shot my fuel tank.

391
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:54,270
That is the closest shave I had with an enemy plane till date.

392
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,820
At that time...

393
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,453
Izaki, you still don't get it?!

394
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:14,001
Platoon Sergeant's voice resonated in my mind.

395
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:22,305
In the next moment I descended rapidly and escaped.

396
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:31,180
My fuel got used up quickly and I made an emergency landing on the sea.

397
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:38,318
I swam for 9 hours in fear of sharks.

398
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:52,950
I fell into a despair many times but each time I was saved by Platoon Sergeant's voice.

399
00:43:53,714 --> 00:43:58,333
No matter how hard it is, put in effort to continue living!

400
00:44:00,940 --> 00:44:10,970
When I was standing at the death abyss, I finally understood the meaning of his words.

401
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:16,192
Thanks to that I survived till today.

402
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:23,570
If not for Platoon Sergeant, my daughter would not have been born.

403
00:44:31,540 --> 00:44:37,870
Now, I can clearly say.

404
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:45,547
Having chose to live like that during that era,

405
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,551
Platoon Sergeant is stronger than any other people.

406
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:56,065
And because he is a strong person, he is able to persist in living like that.

407
00:44:58,446 --> 00:45:04,032
He is definitely not a coward.

408
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,408
But in the end,

409
00:45:15,740 --> 00:45:23,630
My grandfather did not manage to see my grandmother and my mother before his end right?

410
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:34,760
No, there is just this once. After the Pearl Harbor attack, Akagi was docked at Yokosuka Harbor.

411
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:36,555
Eh?

412
00:45:36,780 --> 00:45:45,310
At that time Platoon Sergeant spoke about returning back to his hometown.

413
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:50,960
<Miyabe>

414
00:46:04,553 --> 00:46:05,633
Dear!

415
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:07,462
What's wrong?

416
00:46:11,227 --> 00:46:14,435
There is nothing wrong...

417
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:19,686
If you are coming back, please contact me!

418
00:46:19,986 --> 00:46:22,193
Ahh I am terribly sorry...

419
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:25,484
Docking in Yokosuka Harbor is an highly confidential matter.

420
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,156
Where is Kiyoko?

421
00:46:43,134 --> 00:46:46,501
Are you Kiyoko?

422
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:54,140
Here, here Kiyo chan.

423
00:46:55,820 --> 00:47:00,590
Here, see? It's dad!

424
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:08,360
She's so small!

425
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:13,865
Kiyoko.

426
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,760
How is the bath water?

427
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:33,723
Matsuno! It's terrible Matsuno!

428
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:36,225
What happened!?

429
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:47,065
Ah...

430
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:51,270
I got careless in the bath, but she is such a calm one.

431
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:54,322
She is enjoying I guess.

432
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:57,909
Right? Kiyo chan.

433
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:03,661
It is nice to be in the bath with daddy right?

434
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:23,139
Goodbye.

435
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,355
I shall be on my way.

436
00:48:28,948 --> 00:48:30,108
Please...

437
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:33,110
Be safe.

438
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:45,461
Matsuno.

439
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:54,257
Definitely...

440
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,132
I will be back.

441
00:49:02,231 --> 00:49:04,313
Even if I lost an arm,

442
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:09,356
Or even a leg, I will be back.

443
00:49:12,741 --> 00:49:14,652
Even if I am dead,

444
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:20,738
I will still be back.

445
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,538
Even if I am reborn,

446
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:30,335
I will definitely be back to you and Kiyoko

447
00:49:38,434 --> 00:49:40,390
It is a promise...

448
00:50:10,883 --> 00:50:14,717
To tell the truth, I am in the last stage of cancer.

449
00:50:15,888 --> 00:50:16,923
Eh?

450
00:50:17,056 --> 00:50:22,722
Half a year ago, my doctor told me I still have 3 months.

451
00:50:23,240 --> 00:50:30,680
But some how after half a year until now, I am still alive.

452
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:43,780
As for why my life has held out till today, I think I understand now.

453
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:49,456
It is for me to tell this tale.

454
00:50:51,215 --> 00:50:57,427
For the sake of me telling you the tale of Platoon Sergeant I guess.

455
00:51:12,486 --> 00:51:14,272
Platoon Sergeant,

456
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:19,858
I saw your grandchildren.

457
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:23,486
Platoon Sergeant,

458
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:28,957
Can you see this?

459
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:45,140
I... want to know more.

460
00:51:46,228 --> 00:51:47,308
Yup.

461
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,680
I want to know even more!

462
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:52,848
Yup.

463
00:51:59,780 --> 00:52:08,990
Before being able to return to his wife and daughter, he gave his all to not die.

464
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:22,677
I am good with this.

465
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:28,343
I had just wanted to hear that.

466
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:44,404
To think we had even met once!

467
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:54,039
But if that is the case, why?

468
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:57,537
Hurm?

469
00:52:58,717 --> 00:53:03,381
Why did grandfather chose to be in the Special Attack Unit?

470
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,651
And at 10am...

471
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:28,960
Takeda Chairman, I have something to talk to you about.

472
00:53:29,020 --> 00:53:30,570
It's you again!

473
00:53:30,660 --> 00:53:32,250
I thought I told you that he has no time for you!

474
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:34,086
It is about the investigation of Miyabe Kyuuzou!

475
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:35,410
Please behave yourself!

476
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,587
Miyabe Kyuuzou?

477
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,587
Yes, please.

478
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,469
Well...

479
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:50,933
With that all my appointments in the morning are canceled.

480
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:54,599
Ah.. I am sorry.

481
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:58,687
You do look a little like him.

482
00:54:02,990 --> 00:54:06,357
I remember Instructor very well.

483
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:12,996
When we first met, Miyabe san is the Instructor for our prep school.

484
00:54:13,834 --> 00:54:17,543
In 1945, the war worsened.

485
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,122
Even us students, who had been exempted from serving the army in the past,

486
00:54:21,467 --> 00:54:25,380
Are ordered to served the nation.

487
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:35,640
With both strength and brains, this condition allows us students all to be groomed to become pilots.

488
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:41,647
We were enlisted in the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service,

489
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:44,020
And received harsh training.

490
00:54:44,156 --> 00:54:48,490
But there is almost no practices scheduled for learning how to fight in the air.

491
00:54:49,495 --> 00:54:50,860
Why do you think that is so?

492
00:54:54,000 --> 00:55:00,070
Right from the start, we students are all trained for the Special Attack Unit.

493
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,710
At first, we also have no idea that we are training for the Special Attack Unit.

494
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:12,841
But once the training is over and before the assignment for the real battle,

495
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,934
The slip of paper to confirm our voluntary participation in the Special Attack Unit was given out.

496
00:55:17,120 --> 00:55:22,560
The shock of getting that slip of paper is beyond imagination.

497
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:26,880
But after 3 days, most of the students decided to participate voluntarily.

498
00:55:28,430 --> 00:55:29,860
<Takeda Takanori>

499
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:36,535
In actual fact, of the 4400 people who had died as a Special Attack Force,

500
00:55:36,917 --> 00:55:40,956
Around half are students like me from the prep school.

501
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,206
Yes!

502
00:55:42,339 --> 00:55:44,671
Take note of the lateral wind when landing.

503
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,545
Yes!
That is all. The end.

504
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:48,667
Salute!

505
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,586
At ease!

506
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:53,971
Dismissed!

507
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,048
Roger!

508
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,435
Instructor Miyabe!

509
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:09,063
I should have passed today right?

510
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:11,902
Failed.

511
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:18,208
What is the meaning of that. I did well in the real attack practice!

512
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:21,950
I was surprised that you performed very well.

513
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:26,080
If that is so, then why? Explain to me!

514
00:56:31,847 --> 00:56:33,087
Failed.

515
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,215
Failed, failed, failed!

516
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:40,769
When will that person let me pass!

517
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:45,604
At this rate, we will never get to go out on the battlefield.

518
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:53,360
I heard that that person was useless as he has been running away at the front line.

519
00:56:53,619 --> 00:56:56,452
That must be why they sent him back to the mainland!

520
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,367
Such troublesome matters.

521
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:06,954
Rumors has it,

522
00:57:08,133 --> 00:57:11,170
That person has rejected being in the Special Attack Unit back in Philippines.

523
00:57:12,220 --> 00:57:16,884
Now it is making sense!

524
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:20,600
In short, that Miyabe is a coward!

525
00:57:20,687 --> 00:57:23,019
But yet he refused to pass us.

526
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,189
He must be jealous that we are getting better.

527
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,651
Is that really true, his rejection of being in the Special Attack Unit.

528
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:31,645
I have no idea.

529
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:37,447
But if we are talking about that coward, it may be true.

530
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:41,864
No. 38! Descending!

531
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,172
No. 51! Descending!

532
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,511
Oh! Here comes Ito!

533
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:58,756
He is up next!

534
00:58:17,369 --> 00:58:20,076
Ito! Ito!!

535
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,711
The dead prep school private is lacking discipline in his spirit.

536
00:58:35,595 --> 00:58:38,712
What rubbish is this, destroying an important plane.

537
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:46,890
Losing his life before meeting the enemy, he is a disgrace to the army, an disloyal person.

538
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:53,480
Major, that is not true.

539
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,569
The deceased 2nd Lieutenant Ito is a great man.

540
00:58:59,119 --> 00:59:02,077
He is not a disgrace to the army.

541
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:10,202
You...!

542
00:59:19,306 --> 00:59:21,672
2nd Lieutenant Ito is a great man.

543
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,133
As a Special Attack Unit Training Officer what are you saying!

544
00:59:32,194 --> 00:59:34,105
I heard about your rumors.

545
00:59:34,613 --> 00:59:36,820
You have not been passing these guys right?

546
00:59:38,617 --> 00:59:40,448
Do you not wish to send them to the Special Attack Unit?

547
00:59:42,162 --> 00:59:43,322
Huh?

548
00:59:46,750 --> 00:59:50,163
Just when this country is facing a crisis of survival,

549
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,793
You are such a disgrace!

550
00:59:54,633 --> 00:59:56,999
Stand up. Stand up!

551
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:03,012
Stand up!

552
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,656
Instructor Miyabe!

553
01:00:24,746 --> 01:00:26,077
Instructor...

554
01:00:26,498 --> 01:00:27,954
Are you alright?

555
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:33,502
Yeah, just as what you see.

556
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,752
Enemy aircraft to your right!

557
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:18,542
Disperse!

558
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:43,238
Damn!

559
01:03:38,398 --> 01:03:39,763
Hang in there!

560
01:03:40,483 --> 01:03:42,019
Are you alright?

561
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,022
Why did you do such a stupid thing?

562
01:03:45,113 --> 01:03:48,697
Instructor Miyabe is someone that Japan needs. We cannot let you die.

563
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:52,158
No! You are the one who is supposed to continue living on.

564
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,702
You should live on and do great things for this country!

565
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:06,790
I was careless.

566
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:14,131
I can fully understand the feelings of that prep school private.

567
01:04:18,772 --> 01:04:23,857
After that I was sent to Kyuushu's Tomitaka Airbase,

568
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:27,235
And did not manage to meet Instructor again.

569
01:04:28,865 --> 01:04:33,074
When I heard that Instructor has died as a Special Attack Force,

570
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:36,319
I couldn't bear it.

571
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:42,501
That person ought to have survived.

572
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:50,417
Why did my grandfather joined the Special Attack Unit?

573
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:54,296
I have no idea.

574
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,762
The difficult feelings of a Special Attack Force,

575
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:03,263
Can only be understood by one who was sent out to the battle field.

576
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:10,278
The difference between me, a Special Attack Force and those who never made it back,

577
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:15,116
Is poles apart with a tall barrier in between us.

578
01:05:16,871 --> 01:05:18,281
However,

579
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:26,370
I can still remember vividly the feelings of sending off my comrades.

580
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:35,760
The feelings back then are something that even if I want to forget, I would probably not be able to.

581
01:05:44,315 --> 01:05:46,306
Do you have a job now?

582
01:05:46,401 --> 01:05:48,187
I am still retaking my Law exam...

583
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:52,813
No, I am just bumping around.

584
01:05:53,158 --> 01:05:54,773
I am embarrassed to say that.

585
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:56,324
You will be fine.

586
01:05:56,411 --> 01:05:57,571
Eh?

587
01:05:57,662 --> 01:06:00,995
You have inherited Instructor Miyabe's bloodline.

588
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:04,165
Surely you will be pursuing a fabulous career.

589
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:07,501
Please live your life fully for the sake of Instructor too.

590
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,498
I understand.

591
01:06:12,927 --> 01:06:16,010
I would never have expected such a day to come.

592
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:21,345
The day I can tell Instructor's grandchildren about myself.

593
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:31,021
Landing on an island due to an engine fault,

594
01:06:31,154 --> 01:06:33,520
That could have been one of your alternatives.

595
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:42,745
Why did you choose to be a Special Attack Force, Kyuuzou san?

596
01:06:51,758 --> 01:06:52,713
Yes.

597
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,758
Hey Kentarou, you're late! Where are you now?

598
01:06:57,889 --> 01:06:59,220
Oh!

599
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:01,431
That's just like a school trip!

600
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:02,799
Then how about Saipan?

601
01:07:02,894 --> 01:07:04,350
Why are you being so stingy?

602
01:07:04,437 --> 01:07:06,974
If we are going with girls, it has to be Hawaii right?

603
01:07:07,065 --> 01:07:10,398
Hawaii is good! Let's go to Hawaii!

604
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:12,396
Wow...

605
01:07:14,239 --> 01:07:16,901
Eh? The dress code for today is suits?

606
01:07:16,991 --> 01:07:20,199
Fool! There will be girls today, this dress code is really bad.

607
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:21,196
Really?

608
01:07:21,260 --> 01:07:24,740
We are trying to get the tension up by telling them what kind of a resort we are going to bring them to!

609
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:28,617
This is a team play! I am begging you, don't pull us down!

610
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:30,584
Resort?

611
01:07:30,672 --> 01:07:33,414
Saipan or Okinawa or...

612
01:07:33,508 --> 01:07:34,668
Hawaii!

613
01:07:35,593 --> 01:07:36,924
Sorry to keep you waiting!

614
01:07:37,011 --> 01:07:40,845
Good evening, this way please. Take a seat please.
It has been long since we met!

615
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:42,468
Nice to meet you!

616
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:45,600
Special Attack Unit?

617
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:47,225
Yup.

618
01:07:47,313 --> 01:07:49,099
Digging about in history again...

619
01:07:49,232 --> 01:07:52,770
Say, is there even time for you to be doing that?

620
01:07:54,779 --> 01:07:58,613
Oh well, Kentaro has his own way of thinking I suppose.

621
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:01,407
But I must say, suicidal terrorism is not something just of the past.

622
01:08:01,494 --> 01:08:05,453
Suicidal terrorism? Why are you talking about this!

623
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:10,204
I beg your pardon, but suicide terrorism is different from the Special Attack Unit.

624
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:14,788
It is the same. In short both are results of brain washing.

625
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:18,917
No, they are different. The target of the Special Attack Unit is navy aircraft carriers.

626
01:08:19,012 --> 01:08:21,469
Carriers are machines of mass destruction.

627
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:25,386
They are totally different from suicidal terrorism that kills normal innocent people.

628
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:29,052
I can't really follow such talks.

629
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:30,603
Right?

630
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,769
It is not about such side issues.

631
01:08:33,860 --> 01:08:37,980
More like it is the fundamentals of one giving up his life for his ideals,

632
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:42,532
Look, from the eyes of a foreigner, Special Attack Unit is the same as suicidal terrorism.

633
01:08:42,660 --> 01:08:44,525
They are crazily loyal to the country.

634
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:45,868
That's why I say...

635
01:08:45,997 --> 01:08:46,986
Hey, hey!

636
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:50,661
I have read the wills of those Special Attack Unit members before,

637
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:54,240
They think that giving up their lives for the sake of the nation is an honorable thing to do.

638
01:08:54,460 --> 01:08:57,080
I guess that can be term as some sort of a heroism.

639
01:08:57,216 --> 01:09:01,835
No no, I beg your pardon, but you do not even get it.

640
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,337
I know, I know it well.

641
01:09:04,440 --> 01:09:09,680
You have been failing your bar exam so much that you start to doubt who you are.

642
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:12,394
You are just running away looking for your identity right?

643
01:09:13,232 --> 01:09:15,063
That's why I say it is wrong!

644
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:18,359
What is with that.

645
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:21,021
Why are you so fired up?

646
01:09:21,060 --> 01:09:27,530
In the first place, it is none of our business whether suicidal terrorism and Special Attack Unit is the same, right?

647
01:09:27,622 --> 01:09:30,830
Yeah, this is a place for merry making!

648
01:09:30,917 --> 01:09:32,373
Right? Let's get back to drinking.

649
01:09:36,047 --> 01:09:38,038
Sorry, I think I should just head back.

650
01:09:45,473 --> 01:09:47,213
Such a troublesome guy.

651
01:10:37,984 --> 01:10:40,771
That sword thirsts for human blood.

652
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:44,524
Kageura san.

653
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:46,446
What time do you think it is now?

654
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:52,286
Miyabe Kyuuzou... no...

655
01:10:56,720 --> 01:11:03,630
Please tell me about the story of my grandfather.

656
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:12,553
It seems as if you have matured a little.

657
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:22,317
You said that your own grandfather is a coward right?

658
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:31,656
I thought I have nothing to say to a guy like that.

659
01:11:36,042 --> 01:11:38,328
Did you do more research after that?

660
01:11:41,798 --> 01:11:46,007
Yes, but I cannot find an answer anywhere.

661
01:11:51,098 --> 01:11:56,343
Why did Miyabe chose to be a Special Attack Force?

662
01:11:58,856 --> 01:11:59,845
Yes.

663
01:12:02,860 --> 01:12:06,352
I know that guy had wanted to survive.

664
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:18,700
But right at the end, that guy cut his path to his hopes himself.

665
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:29,870
I... really hated that guy.

666
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:33,755
I love fighting in the skies.

667
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:39,094
My real world lies in the skies instead.

668
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:43,731
I have no regrets even if I die being shot by an enemy.

669
01:12:44,277 --> 01:12:48,441
The more chaotic the war is, the more my blood seethe.

670
01:12:54,912 --> 01:13:00,202
I had wanted to live like a legendary sword master.

671
01:13:10,580 --> 01:13:18,760
But that guy would always go back without a wound after the fight.

672
01:13:19,729 --> 01:13:24,473
This guy clearly avoided fighting.

673
01:13:25,234 --> 01:13:30,604
But yet that guy is an extremely skillful pilot.

674
01:13:33,659 --> 01:13:38,870
I cannot forgive the presence of such a guy.

675
01:13:40,207 --> 01:13:43,290
Sergeant Major Miyabe, I have a request.

676
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:46,289
What is it?

677
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,330
I wanted to do an air battle simulation with you.

678
01:13:52,803 --> 01:13:54,885
There is no such need.

679
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:56,883
Kageura kun has very good skills after all.

680
01:13:56,940 --> 01:14:00,840
I heard that Sergeant Major Miyabe's air battle simulation skill is out of the world.

681
01:14:01,145 --> 01:14:02,305
Please give me some pointers.

682
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:03,644
I refused.

683
01:14:08,736 --> 01:14:10,647
Do you not want to fight?

684
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,521
Do you think that you will lose to me?

685
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:28,937
Did you finally want to fight me? Sergeant Major Miyabe?

686
01:16:17,990 --> 01:16:19,526
I got you!

687
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,673
It can't be! Why?!

688
01:17:23,222 --> 01:17:24,337
Shoot.

689
01:17:25,724 --> 01:17:28,636
Shoot me! I opened fire at you!

690
01:17:28,727 --> 01:17:30,467
Shoot and kill me!!

691
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:34,647
Shoot me! Shoot me! Kill me!

692
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:36,018
Shoot me!

693
01:17:37,820 --> 01:17:39,731
I do not want to make an excuse,

694
01:17:41,657 --> 01:17:45,616
But I really did something unforgivable.

695
01:17:47,538 --> 01:17:49,950
As to why the bullets missed him,

696
01:17:50,200 --> 01:17:57,870
He pretended to be flying straight but in actuality he was flying off tangent on purpose

697
01:17:58,757 --> 01:18:04,218
As I shoot him straight on, the bullets just seem to veer off course.

698
01:18:05,431 --> 01:18:07,717
That guy tested me.

699
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:14,266
From that day onward, I became careful with my life.

700
01:18:15,482 --> 01:18:19,725
I would not die until the day I shoot Miyabe down.

701
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,395
That was what I thought.

702
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:30,744
However the war took a turn for the worse.

703
01:18:32,166 --> 01:18:37,251
They gathered all the forces and in the Battle of the Philippine Sea,

704
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:46,920
The Japanese army took a huge defeat and lost the Absolute National Defense Zone, even Saipan was captured.

705
01:18:47,932 --> 01:18:54,053
The enemy chased all the way till the Philippine Sea and Okinawa.

706
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:10,940
Being cornered, the Japanese army turned to crazed tactics.

707
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,615
That was the Special Attack Unit.

708
01:19:18,587 --> 01:19:24,628
When I heard about the Special Attack plan, I shuddered.

709
01:19:26,971 --> 01:19:31,715
This war has evolved until such stage.

710
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:41,649
If there was a chance of survival in this battle plan, I would have gladly went.

711
01:19:43,445 --> 01:19:47,734
But for the Special Attack plan, there is no chance of survival.

712
01:19:48,909 --> 01:19:51,651
The success of the plan equals to death.

713
01:19:52,663 --> 01:19:54,654
This cannot be called a strategy plan!

714
01:19:57,167 --> 01:20:04,084
"If such strategy can be formulated, Japan has lost" I thought.

715
01:20:06,051 --> 01:20:08,758
After that, I was order to go elsewhere,

716
01:20:09,346 --> 01:20:11,962
And I had to be separated from Miyabe.

717
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:16,475
This time I was sent to Kanoya Airbase in Kyuushu.

718
01:20:16,860 --> 01:20:23,180
As a guard for the Special Attack Units, I was to send them to near the enemy's carrier.

719
01:20:24,445 --> 01:20:26,731
And in that place,

720
01:20:27,281 --> 01:20:29,192
I met that guy again.

721
01:20:31,035 --> 01:20:32,696
However,

722
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:40,704
That Miyabe is no longer the Miyabe that I had known.

723
01:21:07,071 --> 01:21:07,730
Instructor Miyabe!

724
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:09,148
Oh!

725
01:21:09,615 --> 01:21:11,981
Teranishi! Yamada! Kagawa!

726
01:21:12,076 --> 01:21:14,237
How have you been!

727
01:21:14,620 --> 01:21:16,451
You seem to be in good spirits!

728
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:28,148
Mom...

729
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:35,854
That was...

730
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,318
The Special Attack Unit.

731
01:24:47,958 --> 01:24:49,789
The guys who went today,

732
01:24:52,129 --> 01:24:54,290
Were my students.

733
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:06,180
Such scenes...

734
01:25:11,857 --> 01:25:14,394
Are what I see daily.

735
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:32,333
What do you think those guys are able to achieve in that state?

736
01:25:36,340 --> 01:25:39,832
The enemy aircraft has became far superior than the Zero fighter.

737
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:44,712
The anti-aircraft artillery are improving day by day.

738
01:25:48,852 --> 01:25:50,342
Even today,

739
01:25:53,690 --> 01:25:56,773
Most of the planes did not manage to reach the carriers.

740
01:26:08,830 --> 01:26:10,616
Everyone...

741
01:26:15,045 --> 01:26:17,912
Are not meant to die like this.

742
01:26:21,176 --> 01:26:23,918
For the sake of Japan after the war,

743
01:26:26,515 --> 01:26:28,631
They are the ones who ought to have lived on.

744
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:34,269
But even so,

745
01:26:38,568 --> 01:26:40,809
I cannot do anything.

746
01:26:49,204 --> 01:26:51,536
Under such circumstances.

747
01:26:55,293 --> 01:26:56,328
I think there is no help to it.

748
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:58,417
Don't say such things so easily!

749
01:26:58,547 --> 01:27:02,039
How many people, how many of them you think have died!

750
01:27:02,759 --> 01:27:05,717
The duty of the guard planes is to protect the Special Attack Units!

751
01:27:05,804 --> 01:27:10,013
Even if we have to be shields, our duty is to protect them!

752
01:27:11,601 --> 01:27:13,592
But then...

753
01:27:15,772 --> 01:27:18,388
But then I ran away!

754
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:21,812
I left them in lurch to die!

755
01:27:26,366 --> 01:27:32,532
I am living a prolonged life upon their sacrifices.

756
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:40,870
Their deaths have allowed me to continue living.

757
01:27:52,851 --> 01:27:54,807
What should I do?

758
01:27:57,773 --> 01:27:59,479
What should I do...

759
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:03,315
What should I do...

760
01:28:07,449 --> 01:28:09,360
What should I do...

761
01:28:21,820 --> 01:28:29,170
Is that the reason why Grandfather agreed to be a Special Attack Force?

762
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:30,843
I have no idea.

763
01:28:32,682 --> 01:28:38,427
It is as if Miyabe has one foot in the grave that day.

764
01:28:38,688 --> 01:28:42,021
He was emitting such aura from all over.

765
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:47,478
He no longer resembles a human from this world.

766
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:56,119
Around that point in time, even for us senior pilots,

767
01:28:58,208 --> 01:29:01,371
We had to volunteer in the Special Attack Unit strategy.

768
01:29:03,421 --> 01:29:06,879
But I was adamant not to volunteer.

769
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:11,881
Because I feel that dying in such a strategy is just a waste of death.

770
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:14,880
And one fine day,

771
01:29:16,480 --> 01:29:25,590
I saw Miyabe's name in the Special Attack Force list.

772
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:36,905
What is going on?!

773
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:38,533
Why is Lieutenant Miyabe in the Special Attack Force list?!

774
01:29:38,623 --> 01:29:39,738
Why did you volunteer yourself!

775
01:29:39,875 --> 01:29:41,456
You!!

776
01:29:42,836 --> 01:29:46,124
Are you not happy with the decisions of the uppers?!

777
01:29:46,631 --> 01:29:47,871
Say it!

778
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:52,540
Tell them! "Don't make a senior pilot like me die in vain!"

779
01:29:53,179 --> 01:29:56,046
You saw how the Special Attack raid is like!

780
01:29:56,141 --> 01:29:57,506
Tell them!

781
01:29:58,894 --> 01:30:01,601
Tell them that most of them did not even made it near the carrier!

782
01:30:01,938 --> 01:30:03,769
Tell them that most of them died in vain!

783
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:10,105
It's fine, Kageura.

784
01:30:13,199 --> 01:30:14,689
It's fine.

785
01:30:14,784 --> 01:30:16,649
At that moment I swear in my heart.

786
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:20,157
In that case I will protect Miyabe till the end no matter what happens!

787
01:30:20,290 --> 01:30:22,281
I will not let the any of the enemies' bullets pierce him!

788
01:30:22,459 --> 01:30:25,496
I will shoot down every enemy that tries to take Miyabe down!

789
01:30:25,629 --> 01:30:28,962
Even if I am out of bullets, I will use my plane to bring them down!

790
01:30:32,135 --> 01:30:33,841
But...

791
01:30:35,472 --> 01:30:38,635
In the end I lost him again.

792
01:30:42,020 --> 01:30:48,858
The day Miyabe's plane went off to battle, in the skies 100 miles away from the enemy's carrier,

793
01:30:49,653 --> 01:30:52,144
The enemies laid in ambush and the war turned chaotic.

794
01:30:52,781 --> 01:30:58,822
At that time, my plane's engine started to act up.

795
01:31:09,005 --> 01:31:12,623
I saw Miyabe leave the air zone.

796
01:31:14,594 --> 01:31:16,835
I chased after Miyabe,

797
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:20,676
I thought I would follow him no matter what.

798
01:31:20,809 --> 01:31:24,927
But I was not able to catch up to him.

799
01:31:26,606 --> 01:31:31,191
Miyabe's plane suddenly disappeared from my sight.

800
01:31:41,871 --> 01:31:44,533
There was another strange happening.

801
01:31:47,127 --> 01:31:51,291
On the day of attack, Miyabe was not using his usual 52 model,

802
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:54,547
But was using the old 21 model instead.

803
01:31:55,552 --> 01:32:00,296
Just before setting off, he had changed plane with another pilot.

804
01:32:01,725 --> 01:32:03,215
Why did he do that?

805
01:32:03,309 --> 01:32:04,719
I have no idea.

806
01:32:05,603 --> 01:32:10,939
Miyabe was very insistent on going with the 21 model.

807
01:32:11,943 --> 01:32:17,563
It may be that he wanted to go with the familiar model he used before the Pearl Harbor attack.

808
01:32:18,241 --> 01:32:25,488
But this story has an unexpected end to it that I wouldn't say is happy.

809
01:32:28,626 --> 01:32:34,417
The 52 model that Miyabe changed with also had an engine fault.

810
01:32:36,134 --> 01:32:38,625
The pilot was not able to reach the enemy's grounds,

811
01:32:39,429 --> 01:32:42,296
And was recorded to have an emergency landing in Kikaijima.

812
01:32:47,187 --> 01:32:48,802
Don't tell me...

813
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:55,688
That the person on that plane survived?

814
01:32:56,237 --> 01:32:57,773
Yes...

815
01:33:00,575 --> 01:33:02,941
In a short while Okinawa fell.

816
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:08,865
Till the end of war, there was almost no more Special Attack raids.

817
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:17,964
How can that be...

818
01:33:21,554 --> 01:33:26,969
If Grandfather has not changed his plane, he could have been saved?

819
01:33:27,227 --> 01:33:28,888
That we don't know!

820
01:33:30,313 --> 01:33:33,305
But the probability is high.

821
01:33:33,960 --> 01:33:38,310
Then does that mean Granfather himself, gave up his last chance of survival,

822
01:33:38,446 --> 01:33:41,734
Even if it was a mere coincidence?!

823
01:33:56,339 --> 01:33:59,456
How can that happen....

824
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:16,140
I wished I could have met and talked to Grandfather...

825
01:34:20,613 --> 01:34:22,103
At that time...

826
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:27,442
During the day of the attack,

827
01:34:28,913 --> 01:34:32,030
The eyes that guy had after changing over to the 21 model,

828
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:38,370
Are not the eyes of someone who had made peace about dying.

829
01:34:40,140 --> 01:34:49,330
The look in his eyes was as if he is finally going back to his family.

830
01:34:53,271 --> 01:34:57,731
Do you wish to know who was that person who had survived?

831
01:34:58,276 --> 01:35:00,517
If he is still alive, I would like to meet him.

832
01:35:00,820 --> 01:35:05,405
I wanted to ask about the last of him.

833
01:35:16,502 --> 01:35:17,912
This is the list.

834
01:35:21,049 --> 01:35:23,005
Thank you.

835
01:35:24,010 --> 01:35:26,251
It is not something you should thank me for.

836
01:35:29,515 --> 01:35:33,428
This is the end of my story.

837
01:35:40,193 --> 01:35:42,184
Send the young man off.

838
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:46,237
It's ok, my sister is coming to fetch me.

839
01:35:47,283 --> 01:35:48,523
I see.

840
01:35:49,953 --> 01:35:51,113
Yes.

841
01:36:20,984 --> 01:36:23,566
Well, I like young guys.

842
01:36:41,504 --> 01:36:44,496
Goodness me, what is that kid doing!

843
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:55,890
Hey, you are getting drenched to the skin! What are you doing!

844
01:36:57,312 --> 01:36:58,597
What happened?

845
01:37:02,191 --> 01:37:03,977
It's Grandpa.

846
01:37:04,068 --> 01:37:05,183
Eh?

847
01:37:06,446 --> 01:37:08,311
It is Grandpa!

848
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:17,530
The pilot on the 52 model that made an emergency landing is our Grandpa!

849
01:37:19,792 --> 01:37:23,205
What? What is this about?

850
01:37:24,881 --> 01:37:27,167
<Ooishi Kenichiro>

851
01:37:27,220 --> 01:37:33,380
I thought someday, I had to tell all of you about this.

852
01:37:36,184 --> 01:37:41,474
Matsuno said, "There is no need to tell the kids these",

853
01:37:43,232 --> 01:37:46,349
But I had wanted to tell this story.

854
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:53,277
Finally the time has came.

855
01:37:56,329 --> 01:37:57,489
Come.

856
01:38:11,677 --> 01:38:18,264
The place I met Miyabe san was at Tsukuba Airbase.

857
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:25,605
At that time, the person who protected Miyabe Kyuuzou with his life,

858
01:38:26,818 --> 01:38:29,230
Was you, wasn't it Grandpa?

859
01:38:33,199 --> 01:38:38,068
That person protected Ito's reputation.

860
01:38:42,260 --> 01:38:49,460
At that time, if anything were to happen, even if I have to sacrifice myself,

861
01:38:50,550 --> 01:38:53,087
I decided that I have to protect that person.

862
01:38:56,810 --> 01:38:59,640
<Navy Hospital>

863
01:39:11,821 --> 01:39:15,405

I only have this that I can give you at this point of time.

864
01:39:18,411 --> 01:39:20,652
My wife amended this by hand.

865
01:39:21,038 --> 01:39:22,528
I cannot be accepting such precious gift!

866
01:39:22,665 --> 01:39:24,155
It's fine.

867
01:39:24,542 --> 01:39:26,282
I want you to have it.

868
01:39:40,683 --> 01:39:44,301
She is called Kiyoko, written with the kanji for Pure and Child

869
01:39:46,022 --> 01:39:48,388
Kiyoko san is indeed a beauty.

870
01:39:49,609 --> 01:39:53,522
Ah you got it wrong. My wife is known as Matsuno.

871
01:39:53,654 --> 01:39:55,440
Kiyoko is the baby.

872
01:39:55,531 --> 01:39:57,112
Ah...

873
01:39:57,992 --> 01:40:00,404
This child is born after the Pearl Harbor attack.

874
01:40:00,828 --> 01:40:04,867
For the sake of this child, I do not wish to die.

875
01:40:08,711 --> 01:40:13,705
How about Ooishi kun? What would you like to do after the war ends?

876
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:19,259
Hurm...

877
01:40:20,640 --> 01:40:22,380
Is it hard to imagine that?

878
01:40:24,101 --> 01:40:25,261
Ah!

879
01:40:25,394 --> 01:40:26,554
What is it?

880
01:40:26,687 --> 01:40:28,177
No...
Please tell me!

881
01:40:28,272 --> 01:40:29,808
It's nothing...
What is it?

882
01:40:30,816 --> 01:40:33,398
If I survive the war,

883
01:40:33,486 --> 01:40:36,603
It doesn't matter what it is but I would like a job dedicated to helping people.

884
01:40:38,115 --> 01:40:41,232
I had once thought about that.

885
01:40:44,997 --> 01:40:49,741
It will be great if such a day comes.

886
01:41:19,115 --> 01:41:20,605
Instructor Miyabe!

887
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:22,193
Oh!

888
01:41:22,285 --> 01:41:24,992
Teranishi! Yamada! Kagawa!

889
01:41:25,663 --> 01:41:27,153
How have you been!

890
01:41:27,290 --> 01:41:28,530
You seem to be in good spirits!

891
01:41:35,881 --> 01:41:38,293
Instructor Miyabe?

892
01:41:42,805 --> 01:41:44,466
Ooishi kun...

893
01:41:50,730 --> 01:41:52,470
You've recovered?

894
01:41:55,067 --> 01:41:57,729
Yes, thanks for your concern...

895
01:41:59,238 --> 01:42:00,728
That's good...

896
01:42:04,201 --> 01:42:05,361
No...

897
01:42:08,497 --> 01:42:10,579
It may not be good though...

898
01:42:33,022 --> 01:42:37,641
Believe in the indestructible sacred land, live for the eternal justice!

899
01:42:38,402 --> 01:42:39,687
To your success!

900
01:42:48,287 --> 01:42:49,322
Dismiss!

901
01:42:49,413 --> 01:42:50,528
Roger!

902
01:43:34,340 --> 01:43:42,580
At the dawn of tomorrow, the people on the list will take part in the Battle of Okinawa and attack the enemy's fleet as a part of the Special Attack Unit.

903
01:43:45,511 --> 01:43:46,591
The end.

904
01:43:47,430 --> 01:43:48,545
Salute.

905
01:43:53,561 --> 01:43:54,550
At ease.

906
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:10,360
<Ooishi Kenichiro>

907
01:44:12,788 --> 01:44:13,948
Ooishi...

908
01:44:17,334 --> 01:44:19,950
I am fine.

909
01:44:21,338 --> 01:44:23,454
Teranishi and Yamada went too.

910
01:44:24,341 --> 01:44:25,797
I am prepared for the worst.

911
01:44:28,596 --> 01:44:30,006
Instead, look.

912
01:44:33,100 --> 01:44:36,560
<Miyabe Kyuuzou>

913
01:44:49,992 --> 01:44:51,232
What is going on?!

914
01:44:56,165 --> 01:44:57,496
That's nice,

915
01:44:59,126 --> 01:45:00,662
It looks relaxing.

916
01:45:11,514 --> 01:45:12,503
This is weird.

917
01:45:15,684 --> 01:45:17,515
The water is cold.

918
01:45:18,854 --> 01:45:21,015
The weeds are swaying with the wind.

919
01:45:23,000 --> 01:45:28,350
All this minute things that does not matter to me before, became so endearing to me.

920
01:45:31,575 --> 01:45:36,410
Until today, I have not really thought about my family and Japan's future seriously,

921
01:45:38,123 --> 01:45:43,038
Neither have I thought about myself dying.

922
01:45:46,048 --> 01:45:50,712
Even if we are gone, I hope this country will still goes on.

923
01:45:53,010 --> 01:46:02,740
I wonder for the children living now, and their children later on, how would they be talking about the war happening now.

924
01:46:07,319 --> 01:46:09,901
I kept on thinking about such stuff.

925
01:46:16,280 --> 01:46:23,540
I wonder what kind of a country will Japan become then.

926
01:46:34,263 --> 01:46:39,883
Each of you, bear the belief that you will hit the target.

927
01:46:42,563 --> 01:46:43,678
To your success.

928
01:47:07,796 --> 01:47:10,913
Lieutenant Ooishi, I have a favor to ask of you.

929
01:47:13,052 --> 01:47:15,043
Please change planes with me.

930
01:47:19,350 --> 01:47:22,137
Isn't Miyabe san using the 52 model?

931
01:47:22,920 --> 01:47:27,140
Why are you so obsessed and insistent on taking the older 21 model?

932
01:47:28,150 --> 01:47:32,940
21 model is the same as the one that I first rode on.

933
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:37,652
If I were to go, I would like to be with this model.

934
01:47:38,285 --> 01:47:39,365
But...

935
01:47:40,537 --> 01:47:45,748
This is my last self-indulgence, can you go along with me?

936
01:47:59,848 --> 01:48:02,134
Instructor Miyabe!!

937
01:49:20,929 --> 01:49:23,921
Damn it! Damn it!

938
01:49:44,286 --> 01:49:45,651
I don't want to!

939
01:49:53,128 --> 01:49:54,334
Miyabe san!

940
01:49:55,881 --> 01:49:56,711
Miyabe san!!

941
01:50:07,059 --> 01:50:10,517
Miyabe san did not return.

942
01:50:13,065 --> 01:50:15,147
And I was left here.

943
01:50:17,986 --> 01:50:19,271
That was just..

944
01:50:22,366 --> 01:50:24,106
Grandfather's fate...

945
01:50:30,833 --> 01:50:32,164
No.

946
01:50:32,751 --> 01:50:34,287
It is wrong!

947
01:50:38,882 --> 01:50:42,966
For the sake of telling this,

948
01:50:45,389 --> 01:50:51,134
After the war has ended, I went immediately in search of Matsuno's whereabouts.

949
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:55,054
But...

950
01:50:58,193 --> 01:51:05,315
Yokohama, the place that Miyabe san lived in, was burnt down by the air raids.

951
01:51:06,660 --> 01:51:12,200
There is no one who knows where are all the neighbors and Matsuno san.

952
01:51:22,176 --> 01:51:26,419
I contacted my friend working in the Ministry of Health and Welfare,

953
01:51:26,555 --> 01:51:28,887
And finally found their whereabouts,

954
01:51:30,893 --> 01:51:36,229
But that was 2 years after the war.

955
01:51:38,817 --> 01:51:43,106
Matsuno was living in the barracks in Osaka.

956
01:51:46,070 --> 01:51:53,500
She was raising Kiyoko up as a single mother and was leading a hard life.

957
01:51:58,212 --> 01:51:59,748
Definitely...

958
01:52:01,340 --> 01:52:03,171
I will be back.

959
01:52:04,426 --> 01:52:06,041
Liar.

960
01:52:29,201 --> 01:52:30,657
Dear...

961
01:52:39,962 --> 01:52:41,327
I am sorry.

962
01:52:43,757 --> 01:52:48,126
I am Ooishi Kenichiro.

963
01:52:50,138 --> 01:52:54,347
Your husband has took good care of me during the war.

964
01:52:59,773 --> 01:53:03,106
I am Miyabe's wife. Miyabe has been in your good care.

965
01:53:03,193 --> 01:53:04,478
No...

966
01:53:06,822 --> 01:53:11,737
The person in debt of the good care was me.

967
01:53:13,161 --> 01:53:17,279
It was a heart wrenching memory.

968
01:53:18,330 --> 01:53:22,960
Having know that the 2 persons Miyabe san was trying desperately to protect,

969
01:53:23,547 --> 01:53:28,211
Were living such lowly lives, pained my heart greatly.

970
01:53:39,640 --> 01:53:45,380
I told Matsuno about the changing of planes with Miyabe san.

971
01:53:45,944 --> 01:53:51,029
And also the resulting situation of me alone surviving the war.

972
01:53:54,202 --> 01:53:56,193
I had prepared myself for the worst.

973
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:02,203
I am sorry.

974
01:54:05,714 --> 01:54:07,329
It was all my fault.

975
01:54:15,557 --> 01:54:18,469
This was the fate of that person.

976
01:54:20,937 --> 01:54:23,223
It is not your fault.

977
01:54:30,572 --> 01:54:32,108
No! That's wrong.

978
01:54:33,900 --> 01:54:39,240
I cannot imagine that it is just mere coincidence that he changed the 52 model with me.

979
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:45,162
When I did the emergency landing on Kikaijima,

980
01:54:46,338 --> 01:54:50,126
At the control seat,

981
01:54:53,261 --> 01:54:57,800
I found this photo and memo.

982
01:55:02,740 --> 01:55:13,020
When Miyabe san got on to the 52 model, I think he had noticed the fault in the engine.

983
01:55:16,560 --> 01:55:25,080
And on top of that, he left me this photo and memo.

984
01:56:05,700 --> 01:56:11,220
If Lieutenant Ooishi survived this war, I have a request.

985
01:56:12,340 --> 01:56:16,333
If my family is lost on the path and is suffering,

986
01:56:16,928 --> 01:56:18,464
Please help them.

987
01:56:21,975 --> 01:56:23,260
Why?

988
01:56:26,062 --> 01:56:29,680
Forgive me! I am the one ought to have died.

989
01:56:33,195 --> 01:56:34,776
Please leave.

990
01:56:40,827 --> 01:56:44,570
I beg of you, please leave.

991
01:58:17,549 --> 01:58:23,169
Since then, I tried to do whatever I could for them.

992
01:58:24,055 --> 01:58:27,297
When I had time, I would go travel there.

993
01:58:43,325 --> 01:58:48,240
Kiyoko chan, take this to buy some juice.

994
01:58:48,747 --> 01:58:50,487
Juice?

995
01:58:51,708 --> 01:58:52,948
Can I?

996
01:58:54,961 --> 01:58:55,950
No you can't.

997
01:59:07,349 --> 01:59:11,592
Please do not bother yourself with us.

998
01:59:13,313 --> 01:59:15,520
I will not be able to face Miyabe san.

999
01:59:18,610 --> 01:59:21,602
Please take this.

1000
01:59:23,073 --> 01:59:24,609
Even if it is very little.

1001
01:59:27,619 --> 01:59:29,610
I can't, Ooishi san.

1002
01:59:31,373 --> 01:59:33,364
I cannot accept this.

1003
01:59:38,713 --> 01:59:40,453
It is cold.

1004
01:59:51,476 --> 01:59:52,886
Uncle!

1005
01:59:54,604 --> 01:59:58,973
Whenever I got my salary, I would make my way to Osaka.

1006
02:00:00,443 --> 02:00:04,356
Matsuno would not accept it.

1007
02:00:04,906 --> 02:00:08,899
But I went again and again.

1008
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:13,770
That is because I felt that it was my duty to do so.

1009
02:00:14,833 --> 02:00:15,788
For you.

1010
02:00:15,917 --> 02:00:17,498
Thank you!

1011
02:00:18,253 --> 02:00:19,709
Come here!

1012
02:00:32,225 --> 02:00:34,090
All of them are blooming!

1013
02:00:34,853 --> 02:00:35,592
Can you reach?

1014
02:00:36,271 --> 02:00:38,432
I can't reach.
You can't reach?

1015
02:00:39,691 --> 02:00:41,056
Here you go, can you reach?

1016
02:00:41,151 --> 02:00:43,312
I can't touch it.
You can't touch it?

1017
02:00:43,445 --> 02:00:45,777
Here you go!

1018
02:00:53,455 --> 02:00:56,947
Are you ok?!

Please take it

1019
02:00:57,041 --> 02:00:58,622
I am wet!

1020
02:00:58,710 --> 02:01:00,826
Wait, you got to dry yourself!

1021
02:01:00,962 --> 02:01:02,122
Come here!

1022
02:01:02,255 --> 02:01:05,543
Come on! Come here!

1023
02:01:06,217 --> 02:01:08,708
I don't wanna!
Come here!

1024
02:01:11,222 --> 02:01:14,089
Come on, you will catch a cold!

1025
02:01:16,770 --> 02:01:18,806
Did you have fun?
Yup.

1026
02:01:28,531 --> 02:01:30,988
Again! Again!
Again?

1027
02:01:31,117 --> 02:01:32,527
Ready--

1028
02:01:47,675 --> 02:01:51,918
Why are you being so nice to us?

1029
02:02:00,647 --> 02:02:06,483
Because my life is saved by Miyabe san.

1030
02:02:10,160 --> 02:02:16,650
Even if so, there is no need to sacrifice your life for that.

1031
02:02:21,960 --> 02:02:26,454
You have done more than what is needed to atone for it.

1032
02:02:34,973 --> 02:02:39,012
I can't be relying on you any more...

1033
02:02:39,102 --> 02:02:40,387
No, that is not it.

1034
02:02:40,937 --> 02:02:42,518
You got me wrong.

1035
02:02:45,149 --> 02:02:46,889
In the beginning it was a sense of duty.

1036
02:02:48,060 --> 02:02:53,640
But gradually, coming here became a joy to me.

1037
02:02:56,200 --> 02:03:03,220
Being able to support both of you in little ways became an encouragement to my life.

1038
02:03:11,092 --> 02:03:13,299
No, I will be straight about this.

1039
02:03:13,428 --> 02:03:16,010
When I first met you, I was in lov...

1040
02:03:26,733 --> 02:03:28,769
I am a filthy being.

1041
02:03:37,076 --> 02:03:38,862
Please do not go.

1042
02:03:45,084 --> 02:03:47,666
I understand it now.

1043
02:03:49,297 --> 02:03:50,537
Hurm?

1044
02:03:52,467 --> 02:03:54,128
That person...

1045
02:03:56,554 --> 02:03:59,091
Kept his promise.

1046
02:04:04,020 --> 02:04:06,056
He told me.

1047
02:04:09,484 --> 02:04:11,315
"Even if I die,"

1048
02:04:14,155 --> 02:04:16,567
"I will still come back."

1049
02:04:20,745 --> 02:04:22,701
"Even if I were to be reborn,"

1050
02:04:26,459 --> 02:04:29,792
"I will still return to you and Kiyoko."

1051
02:04:44,680 --> 02:04:49,740
You are right here with me now.

1052
02:04:54,529 --> 02:04:56,019
Miyabe has...

1053
02:04:58,783 --> 02:05:01,024
Kept his promise.

1054
02:06:07,560 --> 02:06:11,724
He has wanted to come back no matter what right?

1055
02:06:14,275 --> 02:06:15,685
Why?

1056
02:06:17,153 --> 02:06:21,396
I cannot put it in words clearly,

1057
02:06:23,451 --> 02:06:27,285
I will say what I can gather in words.

1058
02:06:31,626 --> 02:06:35,369
The one thing that i think is clear,

1059
02:06:37,173 --> 02:06:41,712
Is that that person is not afraid of death.

1060
02:06:43,260 --> 02:06:50,760
He is afraid of damaging Matsuno's and your life instead.

1061
02:07:02,073 --> 02:07:06,817
For a person who survived to have to die later,

1062
02:07:08,663 --> 02:07:12,076
He did not want to waste that death,

1063
02:07:14,377 --> 02:07:17,915
But instead he chose to lengthen this story.

1064
02:07:27,849 --> 02:07:32,138
And so we both got married.

1065
02:07:34,760 --> 02:07:42,350
Miyabe was never brought up between us as a topic.

1066
02:07:43,060 --> 02:07:51,190
But both of us have never forgot about Miyabe san.

1067
02:07:59,520 --> 02:08:06,300
I didn't think that both Grandpa and Grandma had this story behind you.

1068
02:08:08,389 --> 02:08:13,258
We are not the only special ones.

1069
02:08:14,729 --> 02:08:19,564
In that era, every one has their story.

1070
02:08:21,100 --> 02:08:29,900
Everyone hid their stories in their heart and carried on living as if nothing happened.

1071
02:08:35,060 --> 02:08:44,920
This is what it is to survive the war.

1072
02:08:54,477 --> 02:08:56,433
In another 10 years,

1073
02:08:57,855 --> 02:09:01,473
Our generations will cease to exist.

1074
02:09:05,780 --> 02:09:15,320
I am glad that I am able to tell this story to you.

1075
02:09:37,144 --> 02:09:42,138
There was another once that such mysterious thing happened.

1076
02:09:46,946 --> 02:09:52,441
I wanted to tell you everything frankly.

1077
02:09:57,164 --> 02:10:01,077
Right after the war ended, I was tricked,

1078
02:10:02,878 --> 02:10:06,962
And was living as a mistress of a certain yakuza.

1079
02:10:10,553 --> 02:10:12,669
The reason as to why I got out of that,

1080
02:10:14,682 --> 02:10:19,426
Was that this certain guy put his life on the line to save me.

1081
02:10:23,440 --> 02:10:31,690
That person came running with a sword stained with blood.

1082
02:10:33,530 --> 02:10:46,820
He threw a wallet at me and said to me "Live on."

1083
02:10:50,500 --> 02:10:58,430
I see it as if it was Miyabe who had came to my rescue.

1084
02:10:59,435 --> 02:11:01,016
Who was that person?

1085
02:11:03,397 --> 02:11:05,058
That was the end.

1086
02:11:08,402 --> 02:11:13,362
Because I took Kiyoko and ran to this place.

1087
02:11:15,451 --> 02:11:18,318
I have no idea who and where he came from...

1088
02:11:19,205 --> 02:11:21,321
I should have came faster!

1089
02:11:22,083 --> 02:11:24,415
I was wrong to have left you alone!

1090
02:11:25,040 --> 02:11:29,950
I was wrong and should have found you faster.

1091
02:11:44,240 --> 02:11:50,470
Who exactly was that person,

1092
02:11:52,488 --> 02:11:54,149
Matsuno?

1093
02:12:32,987 --> 02:12:35,603
And what kind of country will it be then?

1094
02:12:35,698 --> 02:12:40,192
In order to return to my wife and daughter, no matter how tough, I can't die.

1095
02:12:40,560 --> 02:12:45,320
To me, being able to live and return is the utmost importance.

1096
02:12:45,916 --> 02:12:50,660
It will be great if such a day comes.

1097
02:12:51,547 --> 02:12:53,583
Izaki, you still don't get it?!

1098
02:13:02,850 --> 02:13:07,389
Tolerate the intolerable, bear the unbearable,

1099
02:13:07,521 --> 02:13:09,603
For the sake of all eternity...

1100
02:13:14,153 --> 02:13:16,235
Show me some spirit!

1101
02:13:26,373 --> 02:13:27,579
Miyabe.

1102
02:13:28,709 --> 02:13:29,789
Miyabe!

1103
02:13:31,045 --> 02:13:32,910
Are you leaving me behind? Miyabe!

1104
02:13:41,305 --> 02:13:46,550
We shall protect the nation with loyalty...

1105
02:13:58,364 --> 02:14:00,355
Miyabe!

1106
02:14:00,908 --> 02:14:02,444
Miyabe san.

1107
02:14:04,411 --> 02:14:06,527
Please forgive me.

1108
02:14:42,700 --> 02:14:47,945
He is the No. 1 coward in the Navy Air Service.

1109
02:14:48,205 --> 02:14:52,118
Why did Miyabe chose to be in the Special Attack Unit?

1110
02:14:52,376 --> 02:14:55,618
He should have been the one to live and survive.

1111
02:14:55,921 --> 02:15:01,791
This is what it means to have survive the war.

1112
02:15:02,180 --> 02:15:10,960
In my era, that is is the same as saying "I love you".

1113
02:15:12,120 --> 02:15:17,560
That person kept his promise.

1114
02:17:54,850 --> 02:17:59,970
Putting an end to the song of love

1115
02:18:00,355 --> 02:18:04,598
The light in my heart went out

1116
02:18:06,195 --> 02:18:11,610
Offering my one and only life

1117
02:18:11,700 --> 02:18:17,366
Goodbye my friend, I'm off to an eternal sleep

1118
02:18:17,498 --> 02:18:22,834
The blue sky seems so sad

1119
02:18:23,128 --> 02:18:27,792
The sunlight in between the trees seems heart wrenching

1120
02:18:28,759 --> 02:18:34,345
When summer comes, it's just like that day

1121
02:18:34,431 --> 02:18:40,142
When the wind whizzed past and goes off

1122
02:18:40,229 --> 02:18:46,020
Holding back my tears

1123
02:18:46,109 --> 02:18:51,570
Saying goodbyes with a smile

1124
02:18:51,698 --> 02:19:02,541
Making promises we will meet again

1125
02:19:02,626 --> 02:19:08,212
For what reason do I break myself

1126
02:19:08,298 --> 02:19:13,042
To leave only the soul coming back?

1127
02:19:13,929 --> 02:19:19,515
Led by the fireflies dancing in the dark

1128
02:19:19,601 --> 02:19:25,141
I can sense you are here

1129
02:19:42,291 --> 02:19:48,082
If I ever reincarnate

1130
02:19:48,171 --> 02:19:53,791
I would fall in love with you again

1131
02:19:53,927 --> 02:20:04,929
Burning up the life that I have received

1132
02:20:05,063 --> 02:20:10,808
Holding back my tears

1133
02:20:10,944 --> 02:20:16,234
Saying goodbyes with a smile

1134
02:20:16,533 --> 02:20:27,000
If only there's a world full of dreams

1135
02:20:27,836 --> 02:20:32,751
I will pray for that
