1
00:00:54,337 --> 00:00:55,827
Ready?

2
00:00:56,239 --> 00:00:58,036
Hang the king.

3
00:00:59,175 --> 00:01:00,870
-Pull.
-Pull him down.

4
00:01:01,044 --> 00:01:03,877
-Pull.
-Pull him down, Mohawks.

5
00:01:08,351 --> 00:01:10,785
Down with the king.

6
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,124
Let's smash the bastard.

7
00:01:16,292 --> 00:01:19,955
-Help me up. Come on, help me up.
-I've got you. I've got you.

8
00:01:25,802 --> 00:01:27,099
Heave. Heave.

9
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:28,498
-Pull.
-It's going.

10
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:32,505
Pull. Pull. Pull.

11
00:01:35,044 --> 00:01:37,239
Revolution.

12
00:01:37,614 --> 00:01:40,879
A word spoke everywhere.

13
00:01:43,419 --> 00:01:45,580
-Tear him apart.
-Bastard.

14
00:01:46,556 --> 00:01:48,717
To the river.

15
00:01:48,992 --> 00:01:50,391
To the river.

16
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,460
Let's drown him. Come on.

17
00:01:52,629 --> 00:01:54,256
Come on, let's drown the bastard.

18
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:57,024
It's about the bringing down of a king...

19
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,863
...and the noisy shouting, celebrating...

20
00:02:01,838 --> 00:02:04,773
...on the day my Ned and me
come into New York.

21
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:07,876
Then douse the fire. Go ahead, son.

22
00:02:08,411 --> 00:02:09,844
My boy asks...

23
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:12,879
...what it is.

24
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,650
I don't know.

25
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:18,377
Great noisy fight...

26
00:02:18,555 --> 00:02:22,218
...to make our business of trading furs
and skins a hard chore.

27
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:25,150
That's for certain.

28
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:30,861
Though only us, Ned and me, my Kaitlyn
and our two babes taken by fever...

29
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:33,798
... those year I go
stay my family deep in me...

30
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:36,803
... traveling every mile we travel.

31
00:02:37,273 --> 00:02:40,106
Bright as a new penny, Ned is.

32
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:43,803
Like his ma, rest her beautiful soul.

33
00:02:44,981 --> 00:02:47,472
His eyes are the same as hers.

34
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,811
Quick and keen.

35
00:02:49,986 --> 00:02:52,546
She'd have told him more than me.

36
00:02:52,722 --> 00:02:55,816
She'd have been able. Oh, my Katie.

37
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,320
-How do you like it here today?
-Down with the king.

38
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:03,431
Come on, ladies.
Wanna kiss German George?

39
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:07,502
-You filthy bastard.
-Get him. Get him.

40
00:03:10,373 --> 00:03:12,933
I'm no Tory. No.

41
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,407
No, I can't swim.

42
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:20,945
-No more monarchy.
-Down with German George.

43
00:03:21,117 --> 00:03:23,347
Read the declaration.
Read Jefferson's words.

44
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:27,084
Read the Declaration of lndependence.

45
00:03:27,257 --> 00:03:31,023
Daisy, now,
don't you go spoiling our lovely day.

46
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:33,788
-Liberty or death.
-Here.

47
00:03:33,963 --> 00:03:36,932
Good for the curling papers.
Go on, scum.

48
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:38,761
Join our independence.

49
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:41,802
The last thing I need
today is a headache.

50
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,768
Daisy McConnahay,
don't you dare.

51
00:03:43,940 --> 00:03:45,908
-Mama.
-But, Daisy...

52
00:03:46,075 --> 00:03:48,771
-Mama, I must.
-You're so pissing melodramatic, Daisy.

53
00:03:48,945 --> 00:03:51,311
Language, Betsy. Daisy.

54
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,506
Read the declaration.

55
00:03:56,352 --> 00:03:58,445
No more king.

56
00:03:58,621 --> 00:04:00,782
-Liberty or death. No more king.
-No more king.

57
00:04:00,957 --> 00:04:04,256
-Liberty or death. No more king.
-Liberty or death. No more king.

58
00:04:04,427 --> 00:04:05,792
Liberty or death.

59
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:07,293
Hey.

60
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:10,455
Hey, Miss New York,
you coming to join us then?

61
00:04:10,633 --> 00:04:13,329
Liberty or Death. No more king.

62
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:18,805
Liberty or death. No more king.
Liberty or death. No more king.

63
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:21,535
Liberty or death. No more king.

64
00:04:22,378 --> 00:04:24,141
Join the German swine.

65
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:26,077
Piss on the British.

66
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,588
Let me through.

67
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,428
You there. You there.

68
00:04:39,595 --> 00:04:42,530
The Army needs your boat
to drive the British out of Brooklyn.

69
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,360
My boat?

70
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:46,464
No, I can't give it to you.

71
00:04:46,636 --> 00:04:50,732
Citizen, it's your duty,
your responsibility to give us your boat.

72
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:53,000
-Come on, Ned. Let's go.
-Give it to them.

73
00:04:53,176 --> 00:04:55,701
-You're a patriot. You give your boat.
-Take the boat.

74
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,778
-Take the boat.
-Take the boat.

75
00:04:57,947 --> 00:05:00,939
-Take the boat. Take the boat.
-Take the boat.

76
00:05:02,518 --> 00:05:05,783
No, get off. Get off my boat.

77
00:05:05,955 --> 00:05:09,254
-No. Ned. Ned. Ned.
-Take the boat.

78
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:12,688
Not my personals, you bastards.

79
00:05:12,862 --> 00:05:15,126
-Hey, they're mine. Leave me alone.
-Get out.

80
00:05:15,298 --> 00:05:17,129
Get your hands off me.

81
00:05:17,967 --> 00:05:19,764
Leave my son alone.

82
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:21,904
-Leave me alone.
-Come on, get them off.

83
00:05:22,338 --> 00:05:24,533
-Leave my son alone.
-Pa.

84
00:05:24,707 --> 00:05:26,607
-Get him off.
-Ned.

85
00:05:27,877 --> 00:05:31,108
-Take your hands off me.
-Get them off the boat.

86
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,721
Give the patriot a cheer.

87
00:05:41,657 --> 00:05:44,091
Captain, give this man a note.

88
00:05:44,861 --> 00:05:47,227
Let's go and get to the waters.

89
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:49,363
Ned.

90
00:05:49,732 --> 00:05:51,256
-Ned.
-What's your name?

91
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:52,628
-You all right?
-Yeah.

92
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:54,235
Name?

93
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,168
-Hm?
-Dobb.

94
00:05:59,709 --> 00:06:01,370
Tom Dobb.

95
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,643
Well, Dobb.

96
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:06,805
Take this to Wall Street,
and if you want cash for your boat...

97
00:06:06,983 --> 00:06:08,473
Cash or coin in place of my boat.

98
00:06:08,651 --> 00:06:09,845
Who the hell is that?

99
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:11,987
What good for us will come of it?

100
00:06:12,155 --> 00:06:14,817
-You two, guard the boat.
-Aye, sir.

101
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:27,866
They are absolved from all allegiance
to the British Crown...

102
00:06:28,037 --> 00:06:29,436
...and that all commanding...

103
00:06:29,605 --> 00:06:31,971
Why do we travel and trade,
Ned and me?

104
00:06:32,141 --> 00:06:35,372
Oh, bloody mean and damn unkindly thing
to take my boat...

105
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:37,979
...with its full stock of skins and furs.

106
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:40,047
We're an independent state.

107
00:06:40,216 --> 00:06:43,913
-Join or die.
-Join or die.

108
00:06:44,087 --> 00:06:45,486
Here, read it for me, Ned.

109
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:51,992
" Boat and providence, $70."

110
00:06:55,031 --> 00:06:56,225
-Come on.
-Join or die.

111
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:59,300
-Join or die.
-We got no money, Pa.

112
00:06:59,469 --> 00:07:02,734
-No, we ain't.
-Where are we gonna sleep?

113
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:05,965
But he keeps asking
the whys and wherefores.

114
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,835
They don't want a king here anymore
as far as I reckon.

115
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,480
That's all my learning of it.

116
00:07:20,823 --> 00:07:22,518
Wait here, Ned.

117
00:07:23,092 --> 00:07:24,821
Wait for me here.

118
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:33,764
Come through, then. Move along.

119
00:07:51,087 --> 00:07:54,250
Down with King George.

120
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:57,954
-An independent state.
-Yay!

121
00:07:58,161 --> 00:08:02,564
That they are absolved from
all allegiance to the British Crown.

122
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:11,736
-Shut up.
-Fellow patriots.

123
00:08:11,908 --> 00:08:14,468
There is no cash. It's gone to war.

124
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,211
These notes are issued
by the Treasury of the United States--

125
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:25,081
God bless our Congress.
And they'll be redeemed in gold.

126
00:08:28,391 --> 00:08:30,916
-Two weeks.
-Two weeks.

127
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,754
-When the war is won.
-Two weeks.

128
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:34,590
-When the war is won.
-When the war...

129
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:39,064
What is a congress
that God should bless it?

130
00:08:39,902 --> 00:08:41,460
Oh, words be a sad struggle...

131
00:08:41,637 --> 00:08:44,697
...not being a reader or a writer
of my language.

132
00:08:44,874 --> 00:08:47,240
I read only my feelings.

133
00:08:47,410 --> 00:08:50,573
And they say, king or congress...

134
00:08:50,746 --> 00:08:52,304
...is all the same to me.

135
00:08:52,481 --> 00:08:56,611
He's... He says the notes in your hand
are worth more than gold.

136
00:08:56,786 --> 00:09:00,449
They are the future
of your country.

137
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,420
Our country.

138
00:09:02,592 --> 00:09:04,822
Our country.

139
00:09:05,995 --> 00:09:09,294
Two weeks. Now, get out.

140
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:18,334
Five shillings, and I repeat,
5 shillings on the drumhead.

141
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:21,340
Now, what about you, young man?

142
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,205
-Can I beat the drum?
-Can you what?

143
00:09:23,379 --> 00:09:26,405
-Beat the drum.
-Can you beat the bloody drum, he says.

144
00:09:26,582 --> 00:09:27,810
Of course you can.

145
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,612
Come on.
Step up and get your 5 shillings.

146
00:09:30,786 --> 00:09:31,878
Right, come on then.

147
00:09:34,123 --> 00:09:36,387
Open the door now.

148
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:45,230
-I don't think women should fight.
-I will.

149
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:49,466
Right. Stand up straight here.

150
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,936
Turn to your left.

151
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:53,041
-Ned, it's your father.
-Ned.

152
00:09:53,209 --> 00:09:54,904
What? What'd you do?

153
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,868
What happened?

154
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:59,445
Five shillings, Pa.
It's for you.

155
00:09:59,615 --> 00:10:03,210
And a hundred and fifty acres of land
when the war's over.

156
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:07,186
-What'd you do, Ned?
-I joined up, Pa.

157
00:10:08,624 --> 00:10:11,491
-No, you ain't. Come on.
-Where you going with that boy?

158
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:14,061
No, it's my son.

159
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:22,504
Here. Here's your 5 bob back.

160
00:10:22,672 --> 00:10:24,230
It was a mistake here. Come on.

161
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:26,568
Where do you think you're going, mister?

162
00:10:26,742 --> 00:10:29,176
Step back here at once.

163
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,442
-What do you think you're doing?
-I was in the commissary.

164
00:10:33,616 --> 00:10:35,345
-I found out he joined.
-That's right.

165
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:38,885
-But it's a mistake. He ain't joined.
-ls this a mistake, Corporal Smith?

166
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:40,147
I recognize the boy.

167
00:10:40,323 --> 00:10:42,223
-Show him the roll book.
-Top of the list.

168
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:45,417
I know his name. I'm his Pa.
I told you, he ain't joined.

169
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:47,585
-Yes, he has.
-He ain't had my permission.

170
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:49,088
Makes no difference.

171
00:10:49,265 --> 00:10:51,460
He received the 5 shillings
and signed his name.

172
00:10:51,634 --> 00:10:54,068
-Right here.
-You cross his name off with that quill.

173
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:56,761
-Then it never happened. Come on.
-Detain that man.

174
00:10:56,939 --> 00:10:58,372
-Hold him there.
-Let go.

175
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,406
This boy's a recruit.

176
00:11:01,644 --> 00:11:04,408
Your son's a soldier now.
You're in the Army.

177
00:11:07,383 --> 00:11:10,284
-You can't just take him.
-They're all somebody's sons, mister.

178
00:11:10,453 --> 00:11:13,320
And they're all willing to shed
their blood fighting tyranny.

179
00:11:13,489 --> 00:11:16,390
Ask your boy whose war.

180
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:20,125
-All right, let's move on.
-No.

181
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:22,829
-Come, let's move it.
-No, it ain't his war.

182
00:11:22,998 --> 00:11:25,432
-Company, about face.
-Come on, let's get it moving.

183
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:28,798
-Left right, left right.
-You can't force him in.

184
00:11:29,205 --> 00:11:30,900
Hold, hold, hold it. Sergeant.

185
00:11:31,574 --> 00:11:34,008
Come now, you gotta be a family man.

186
00:11:34,176 --> 00:11:37,577
I've had three kids, one wife dead.
That's all I got living.

187
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:41,410
-Come on, you can't take him from me.
-Sons go to war because fathers don't.

188
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:44,512
If you wanna see your son again,
just sign the roll book.

189
00:11:44,687 --> 00:11:45,847
Pa.

190
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:53,994
Hold him. If you do that once more,
I'll run you through, so help me.

191
00:11:54,697 --> 00:11:57,325
Now, if you wanna see your son,
you sign the book.

192
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,436
That's right, sign up.
Four in my family signed up.

193
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:03,629
Sign the book here.

194
00:12:05,841 --> 00:12:07,570
You're a bastard.

195
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:10,004
Hold him.

196
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:16,182
-Sign on the line.
-You're a bastard.

197
00:12:16,352 --> 00:12:19,082
And you
watch your language too, mister.

198
00:12:21,223 --> 00:12:22,588
Good.

199
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:27,019
Hey, Mr. Dobbs.
Here's your 5 shillings.

200
00:12:27,196 --> 00:12:30,825
You are now a member
of the United States Army.

201
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,168
Read Jefferson's words.

202
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:43,505
Read Jefferson's words.

203
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:47,843
-Read the Declaration of lndependence.
-One musket, two flints.

204
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,679
-One powder horn.
-Don't worry.

205
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:51,877
One musket...

206
00:12:52,054 --> 00:12:53,919
Here you are. Half a cup of peas.

207
00:12:54,089 --> 00:12:56,580
-...two flints, one powder horn.
-That's right, half a cup.

208
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:59,785
Now there, you join them over there.
One piece of dried fish.

209
00:12:59,962 --> 00:13:01,759
Keep it dry, now, keep it dry.

210
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:05,830
Fight the whole of
our life to get born...

211
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:09,732
...to stay alive, fight nature,
gain food and warmth.

212
00:13:09,905 --> 00:13:12,465
Fight our faults to
stay a decent man.

213
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:16,077
And now to fight someone else's
goddamn fight...

214
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:20,807
...that I have no understanding of
or reason for.

215
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:24,944
Oh, my Ned.
All for the sake of banging a drum.

216
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,588
There's freedom in your muskets, boys.

217
00:13:27,756 --> 00:13:30,190
-We love you.
-I'll pray for you, men.

218
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:34,820
-God's with you all.
-For liberty.

219
00:13:35,130 --> 00:13:36,392
-I love you.
-Liberty.

220
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:40,299
No more king.

221
00:13:44,039 --> 00:13:46,837
I look in the face of
women to see a reminder.

222
00:13:47,009 --> 00:13:50,035
Some mirror of my Katie,
taken from us.

223
00:13:50,646 --> 00:13:52,580
I never, ever see it.

224
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,340
Other women...

225
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:56,713
...lost to me.

226
00:13:58,888 --> 00:13:59,912
Liberty or death.

227
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:01,613
Goodbye.

228
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:04,088
Liberty or death.
Liberty or death.

229
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,093
-Liberty or death.
-Victory.

230
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:10,196
Godspeed.

231
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:14,936
Liberty. To freedom.

232
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:19,702
We love you.

233
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:27,444
Listen good to me now, Ned.

234
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,382
When we get to where we're going...

235
00:14:31,921 --> 00:14:35,049
...if something should happen to me,
we get separated...

236
00:14:35,224 --> 00:14:38,819
...you stick by the officers,
do you hear?

237
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:40,920
They never risk hurt.

238
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:43,860
You stick close to the officers...

239
00:14:44,099 --> 00:14:47,728
...and you look out for yourself first,
you hear?

240
00:14:49,705 --> 00:14:52,902
This is the note, remember?
They gave us for the boat.

241
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:56,772
You keep it.
Go ahead, put it in your shoe.

242
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:13,094
Be brave, boys.
We fight for a true and just cause.

243
00:15:13,262 --> 00:15:15,321
God will be with us.

244
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,195
Our life will turn
in many a strange direction.

245
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,205
Now coming on a boat of my own
to trade my trappings of fur and skins...

246
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:30,243
... to go off on a boat of war
to fight for a word they named liberty...

247
00:15:30,412 --> 00:15:35,247
...of which I am unknowing,
never having had it in my own life...

248
00:15:35,417 --> 00:15:37,681
... wondering of its need.

249
00:15:37,953 --> 00:15:40,114
The British are coming.

250
00:15:40,756 --> 00:15:42,747
Get out of New York.

251
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:45,416
Washington's words.
Read George Washington's words.

252
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:47,824
British are coming.
Get out of New York.

253
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:49,259
Washington's words.

254
00:15:54,303 --> 00:15:57,761
Daisy. Daisy McConnahay,
if you go out there, you're a fool.

255
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,498
Daisy, take me with you.

256
00:15:59,675 --> 00:16:01,802
Mama told us we
shouldn't go outside.

257
00:16:01,977 --> 00:16:03,035
-Daisy.
-Mama.

258
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:04,406
Daisy, what is it?

259
00:16:04,580 --> 00:16:07,310
What are you getting up to now?
What is all this?

260
00:16:07,483 --> 00:16:09,508
You're not going out
into that street today.

261
00:16:09,685 --> 00:16:11,152
Don't you know what's happened?

262
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,311
I know very well what's
happening out there.

263
00:16:13,489 --> 00:16:15,650
There's madness out there,
Daisy, madness.

264
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:18,554
-You don't understand.
-I forbid you to leave this house.

265
00:16:18,727 --> 00:16:20,422
Mama, I'm sorry.

266
00:16:21,063 --> 00:16:23,998
-Serves you right if you get yourself raped.
-You... Oh!

267
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,724
Don't be so vulgar, Betsy.

268
00:16:54,463 --> 00:16:56,397
I'll help hold him.

269
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,440
Dr. Sloan?

270
00:17:13,482 --> 00:17:14,881
Dr. Sloan?

271
00:17:15,050 --> 00:17:17,450
What in blazes are you doing here,
Miss McConnahay?

272
00:17:18,987 --> 00:17:22,354
This is no place for you.
Go home to your mother and sisters.

273
00:17:22,524 --> 00:17:26,460
-I brought some food.
-Well, give it out, and you go home, Daisy.

274
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:32,861
Give me something for
a tourniquet here.

275
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,282
Now hold it, girl.

276
00:18:06,268 --> 00:18:11,729
Brooklyn Heights shows
the terrible force of the British army.

277
00:18:11,907 --> 00:18:14,000
And this man called Washington.

278
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:19,910
And all us under him
are suffering painful defeat.

279
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:24,451
Legs and limbs strewed
along the flowered fields.

280
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:26,980
I and Ned before
ever lifting our weapon...

281
00:18:27,156 --> 00:18:31,320
...were in the whistling path
of deadly grapeshot and chain.

282
00:19:04,126 --> 00:19:06,959
Again, this lass?

283
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:09,455
You got eats?

284
00:19:10,365 --> 00:19:13,596
-Her face come like a strange omen.
-Yeah.

285
00:19:13,769 --> 00:19:16,067
Why does she appear this way?

286
00:19:17,806 --> 00:19:20,468
What may she want from us?

287
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:24,370
She causes an uncomfort to me.

288
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,274
Is there some purpose to it?

289
00:19:29,384 --> 00:19:32,012
-Here.
-Thanks.

290
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:36,121
You fought in the battle?

291
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,817
It must have been terrible.

292
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:41,524
God, you're cut.

293
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,767
Wait, I'll...

294
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:49,636
Let me help you. Lie back.

295
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,992
What was it like out there?

296
00:20:14,730 --> 00:20:16,163
Could you tell me?

297
00:20:18,233 --> 00:20:20,292
-The fighting?
-Yeah.

298
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:21,493
You wanna know that?

299
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:24,829
-Why do you wanna know that?
-Please.

300
00:20:30,512 --> 00:20:34,881
We was just over there in...

301
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:38,312
In the marshes.

302
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:41,686
Under the Brooklyn Heights.

303
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:45,623
Was dawn.

304
00:20:46,028 --> 00:20:47,825
We was waiting.

305
00:20:49,631 --> 00:20:51,223
There was shooting.

306
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:57,371
Then men just start falling
all around us from the gunfire.

307
00:20:57,739 --> 00:20:59,366
You saw the British?

308
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:03,238
-We never saw no one.
-No, they used chain...

309
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:07,574
...from the cannon they shot chain
and grape.

310
00:21:08,550 --> 00:21:10,484
Cutting men down.

311
00:21:10,752 --> 00:21:12,686
Cutting them in half.

312
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:14,653
It was my first battle.

313
00:21:16,425 --> 00:21:18,359
You're so brave.

314
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:20,722
You keep your head down, Ned.

315
00:21:21,396 --> 00:21:22,863
Get some sleep, son.

316
00:21:34,476 --> 00:21:37,036
You fought for our cause.

317
00:21:37,446 --> 00:21:41,974
My cause to fight
was to stay with my boy only.

318
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:45,186
She has little knowing of me.

319
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:47,686
She seems as though lost.

320
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:52,555
Some hurtful sadness in her
would have me say words of comfort...

321
00:21:53,095 --> 00:21:55,256
...for I could find the words.

322
00:21:55,430 --> 00:21:58,729
-On your feet. Let' s go.
-Move, I said. Move yourselves.

323
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,959
How many more times do we tell you?

324
00:22:01,136 --> 00:22:03,764
-Come on, lads.
-Face back there.

325
00:22:03,939 --> 00:22:05,634
-Come on.
-Come along.

326
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:09,368
-Form up and march, you sluggards.
-You lousy vermin.

327
00:22:09,544 --> 00:22:11,978
-Back to the wall.
-Get on your feet.

328
00:22:12,147 --> 00:22:13,444
Form up.

329
00:22:13,615 --> 00:22:16,015
Form up. Come on.

330
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:20,086
-Get in line and follow these men.
-Go on. Get up.

331
00:22:20,956 --> 00:22:24,517
Move along.
Back to the line.

332
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:38,400
To be an American in this uneven
fight is to be a lamb to slaughter.

333
00:22:38,573 --> 00:22:40,837
An angry squirrel fighting a lion.

334
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:42,442
God's on our side.

335
00:22:42,611 --> 00:22:43,669
Come on, son. Come on.

336
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:45,369
-Be brave.
-Stay close to me, son.

337
00:22:45,547 --> 00:22:48,948
Get to the wall.
Get to your positions.

338
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:51,415
Come on, boy.
We can beat them.

339
00:22:51,586 --> 00:22:53,349
-God have mercy.
-Aim for the officers.

340
00:22:53,522 --> 00:22:54,955
Amen.

341
00:22:56,792 --> 00:22:59,818
Aim for the officers.

342
00:23:07,202 --> 00:23:09,363
Be brave, men.

343
00:23:09,538 --> 00:23:12,006
They're nothing
but bloody animals.

344
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:14,301
Friday's children.

345
00:23:25,053 --> 00:23:28,250
-Major.
-Ready, my lord.

346
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,807
For king and country.

347
00:23:49,978 --> 00:23:51,707
Hear me.

348
00:23:51,947 --> 00:23:55,041
God is with you.
Be brave.

349
00:23:55,217 --> 00:23:58,482
You're British soldiers and the
best bloody regiment in the world.

350
00:24:00,088 --> 00:24:02,716
Extend the range, captain.

351
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,923
Forward march.

352
00:24:30,285 --> 00:24:32,412
Good job.

353
00:24:34,589 --> 00:24:37,558
Keep your dressing.

354
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:47,532
Get ready, boys.

355
00:24:47,702 --> 00:24:49,727
Hold your fire.

356
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:54,135
Many a time have I prepared
a weapon to defend against a threat.

357
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:58,706
Well, unruly beasts
during the need of fur to trade...

358
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,441
...but never to the destruction
of another human soul.

359
00:25:04,152 --> 00:25:09,089
If it be in me to do,
I cannot know.

360
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,625
Aim steady, men.

361
00:25:20,402 --> 00:25:23,496
On my command. Fire.

362
00:26:12,854 --> 00:26:15,152
Regiment...

363
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:17,518
...hold.

364
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:20,522
Poise muskets.

365
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,359
Make ready.

366
00:26:27,802 --> 00:26:29,861
Front rank, fire.

367
00:26:34,209 --> 00:26:36,871
Second rank, fire.

368
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:41,681
Rear rank, fire.

369
00:26:43,551 --> 00:26:46,145
Back to the second line.

370
00:26:56,298 --> 00:26:58,391
Remember, you're Americans.

371
00:26:58,566 --> 00:27:02,024
Come back. Stand and fight.
Hold your ground.

372
00:27:09,644 --> 00:27:12,112
Order arms.

373
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:15,078
Present bayonets.

374
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:19,983
By the center. And march.

375
00:27:27,962 --> 00:27:30,931
Keep your dressing.

376
00:28:06,034 --> 00:28:07,126
Fall back, men.

377
00:28:08,136 --> 00:28:09,967
-Fall back.
-Come on, now. Come on, Ned.

378
00:28:10,138 --> 00:28:14,404
-Long live America.
-God, it's a massacre.

379
00:28:32,327 --> 00:28:34,124
Come back.
Stand your ground.

380
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:40,300
Ned.

381
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:43,998
Get him.

382
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:22,435
Charge. Charge.

383
00:29:27,081 --> 00:29:29,743
Run. Run for your lives.

384
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:58,906
Back. Back, Ned.

385
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:01,272
Come on.

386
00:30:05,920 --> 00:30:07,547
Pa.

387
00:30:08,122 --> 00:30:11,353
-Pa.
-Bastard.

388
00:30:11,759 --> 00:30:13,226
Ned.

389
00:30:13,394 --> 00:30:14,884
-Jump.
-Come on.

390
00:30:15,263 --> 00:30:18,460
Come along, lad.
Get the flag.

391
00:30:24,172 --> 00:30:27,005
God save King George.

392
00:30:43,391 --> 00:30:48,920
I, being born of another place,
sold and sent as a babe to this land...

393
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:51,622
...makes me only
some little bit American.

394
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:55,428
For I would as leaf be back in
the natural land of my birth...

395
00:30:55,603 --> 00:31:00,540
...than caught in this butchery
for a cause not mine.

396
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:03,141
Regiment...

397
00:31:03,411 --> 00:31:06,437
...reform at color.

398
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:17,114
-The Army was going north.
-Wait for me.

399
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:19,954
-Let them go.
-We're gonna cut around the British.

400
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:24,963
I'll take freedom for Ned and me
from this bloodshed now and here.

401
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,896
We're going home.

402
00:31:28,269 --> 00:31:30,237
It's over for us.

403
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:36,105
This war's over for us.

404
00:31:37,211 --> 00:31:38,576
Come on.

405
00:31:41,716 --> 00:31:44,879
Wait for me, Billy. Wait.

406
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:48,586
What are we gonna do, Pa?

407
00:31:48,957 --> 00:31:50,686
I don't know, son.

408
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:53,150
Go back to New York.

409
00:31:53,761 --> 00:31:55,820
Work in the rope factory.

410
00:32:00,234 --> 00:32:03,032
-Get out.
-Heads up, men.

411
00:32:06,374 --> 00:32:08,205
Go home.

412
00:32:14,549 --> 00:32:17,484
Watch out for trouble.
Keep your eyes peeled.

413
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:21,755
Come here, you little rat.

414
00:32:21,923 --> 00:32:25,620
New York is not as we left it.

415
00:32:25,893 --> 00:32:30,728
It is now a place of complete England
with its ceremony and its soldiers.

416
00:32:30,898 --> 00:32:33,526
Oh, but the throne itself
fills every street and alley.

417
00:32:34,802 --> 00:32:38,294
They that were called
the Continental Army...

418
00:32:38,473 --> 00:32:41,670
...broken as a dry twig.

419
00:32:42,276 --> 00:32:45,507
-We' re with you, lads, don't worry.
-Yeah, the Mohawks are with you.

420
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,841
-We're with you.
-We'll get them next time.

421
00:32:48,016 --> 00:32:49,574
Back there.

422
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:53,987
Here, have a drink.

423
00:32:54,889 --> 00:32:56,151
Thanks, lady.

424
00:32:56,324 --> 00:32:57,916
You too, my brave boy.
Drink up.

425
00:32:58,092 --> 00:33:00,788
-Thanks. -It's Merle the drummer.
He hasn't seen us.

426
00:33:01,562 --> 00:33:03,189
-Here, drink.
-Merle.

427
00:33:04,899 --> 00:33:08,164
-Ned.
-Get back in line there.

428
00:33:08,436 --> 00:33:09,733
This can't change anything.

429
00:33:11,372 --> 00:33:15,638
All right, move, move, move. Come on.
All right, corporal, get them in the line.

430
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:20,745
-Welcome. Welcome to New York.
-Be careful, Ned.

431
00:33:26,654 --> 00:33:28,315
Declaration.

432
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:31,583
Although the Congress
whom the misguided Americans...

433
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:33,659
...suffer to direct their opposition...

434
00:33:33,828 --> 00:33:37,696
...to a reestablishment of the constitutional
government of these provinces...

435
00:33:37,865 --> 00:33:40,766
-...have disavowed every purpose of...
-Stop. Stay there, lad.

436
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,199
-Merle, it's me.
-Ned, you got away.

437
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:46,363
Shut your corn box, boy.
No talking.

438
00:33:47,809 --> 00:33:50,903
Where are your glorious rebels now,
Daisy?

439
00:33:51,079 --> 00:33:54,742
-Run off like skunks?
-Oh, look. Look at father with the general.

440
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,508
...from the misguided Americans...

441
00:33:56,684 --> 00:33:58,481
Betsy,
do you think we'll meet him?

442
00:33:58,653 --> 00:34:01,952
Him and the cream of the British Army,
my dear.

443
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,057
They'll be drooling at our feet.

444
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:06,284
Every colony is part
of the British Empire.

445
00:34:06,461 --> 00:34:07,485
God, you disgust me.

446
00:34:07,662 --> 00:34:09,857
The king,
being most graciously disposed...

447
00:34:10,398 --> 00:34:13,595
...to direct a revision
of such of his royal instructions...

448
00:34:13,768 --> 00:34:17,397
...as may be construed
to lay an improper restraint...

449
00:34:17,572 --> 00:34:21,064
...upon the freedom of legislation
in any of his colonies...

450
00:34:21,242 --> 00:34:23,972
...and to concur
in the revisal of all acts...

451
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:27,273
...by which his subjects there
may think themselves aggrieved...

452
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:30,645
...it is recommended
to the inhabitants at large...

453
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:33,514
...to reflect seriously
upon their present conditions...

454
00:34:33,688 --> 00:34:37,351
...and their expectations,
and to judge for themselves...

455
00:34:37,525 --> 00:34:40,585
...whether it be more consistent
with their honor and happiness...

456
00:34:40,762 --> 00:34:42,957
...to offer up their lives...

457
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:50,827
...or to return to their allegiance,
accept the blessings of peace...

458
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:59,009
...upon the true principles
of the constitution.

459
00:34:59,180 --> 00:35:04,311
Given at New York,
the 19th day of September, 1776...

460
00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:06,248
You ran?

461
00:35:07,822 --> 00:35:10,848
We all ran. Everybody ran.

462
00:35:12,927 --> 00:35:14,952
You ran?

463
00:35:18,132 --> 00:35:20,293
It was run or get caught.

464
00:35:20,601 --> 00:35:21,829
So I ran.

465
00:35:26,107 --> 00:35:29,543
I thought you might have
stood your ground, Mr. Dobb.

466
00:35:30,344 --> 00:35:32,073
Ain't my fight.

467
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,306
It ain't my fight.

468
00:35:34,482 --> 00:35:39,283
She gives fright to me with her fury
to believe in some kind of fairy-tale soldier.

469
00:35:39,453 --> 00:35:41,444
I wanna tell her so,
be shut of her.

470
00:35:41,622 --> 00:35:45,422
And yet, she ties my tongue.

471
00:35:51,799 --> 00:35:53,960
-You gotta be careful, you hear?
-Come here.

472
00:35:54,135 --> 00:35:57,696
-Yes, Pa.
-Come here, you. Get out.

473
00:35:58,606 --> 00:36:01,404
-Watch it, Ned.
Don't catch their eye. -Yes, Pa.

474
00:36:02,276 --> 00:36:04,972
Hello, little soldier.

475
00:36:05,146 --> 00:36:07,171
Go ahead.

476
00:36:08,516 --> 00:36:09,540
Just keep going.

477
00:36:09,717 --> 00:36:12,811
Us that's fought are now
sought as lowly criminals...

478
00:36:12,987 --> 00:36:17,356
...scurrying like rats in the shadows
to save our skin.

479
00:36:17,525 --> 00:36:20,961
Renegade, rebel traitors,
that's what we 're named.

480
00:36:21,128 --> 00:36:26,657
And so this high-held word, liberty,
has come to shackle and enslave us.

481
00:36:28,002 --> 00:36:29,469
Look here. Let me show you.

482
00:36:29,637 --> 00:36:32,538
Let me show you down the sides.
No, it's beautiful. Beautiful.

483
00:36:32,707 --> 00:36:36,165
And these curls are so crisp.
Pierre, so crisply curled.

484
00:36:40,314 --> 00:36:41,474
Daisy.

485
00:36:41,649 --> 00:36:43,879
My God, Mama,
what's going on here?

486
00:36:44,051 --> 00:36:46,679
Now, Daisy,
before you start, don't.

487
00:36:46,854 --> 00:36:49,084
I haven't the patience
and I haven't the time.

488
00:36:49,257 --> 00:36:52,090
Now, here, take this.
This is you.

489
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:56,196
Now, go and make yourself presentable.
Tonight is a very special occasion.

490
00:36:56,364 --> 00:36:59,629
The chance of a lifetime for your sisters.
So don't you go spoiling it.

491
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:01,825
-Here, dear, more powder.
-No.

492
00:37:02,003 --> 00:37:03,698
Be quiet, Amy.
Don't be peevish.

493
00:37:03,871 --> 00:37:04,963
-More powder.
-Mama.

494
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:11,874
What are those cases of luggage?

495
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:16,540
Now, these belong to two young officers
the general has asked us to billet.

496
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:20,546
Lord Hampton and Lord Darling.

497
00:37:20,721 --> 00:37:24,487
Nobility, Daisy,
and both of them unmarried.

498
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:27,890
Lord Hampton
is the nephew of Poppy Hessup...

499
00:37:28,062 --> 00:37:31,498
...who I'm told stands very close
to the queen's chamber.

500
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:34,396
Yeah, holding the pot, no doubt.

501
00:37:35,469 --> 00:37:37,096
I'll not say any more, Daisy.

502
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:42,038
We all know your views on the subject,
but tonight, please keep them to yourself.

503
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:47,237
Now, here's your dress.
Go and put it on and try, just for once...

504
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:51,818
...to behave like a respectable member
of this family.

505
00:37:53,387 --> 00:37:55,082
Betsy.

506
00:37:55,957 --> 00:37:57,322
And while you're up there...

507
00:37:57,491 --> 00:38:01,621
...you can clear your room
of all that poxy rebel-patriot stuff.

508
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:04,123
As you wish.

509
00:38:06,167 --> 00:38:07,862
Voilà, madam.

510
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:15,599
We'll be out here all night.

511
00:39:05,793 --> 00:39:07,920
I'm sorry, may I interrupt?

512
00:39:15,503 --> 00:39:17,528
Daisy, what are you doing?

513
00:39:17,705 --> 00:39:22,199
Betsy, I'm sure you don't
mind sharing him with your Daisy.

514
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,549
Charming little girls.

515
00:39:31,185 --> 00:39:34,552
Oh, what are you doing?
Oh, why don't you give me one, huh?

516
00:39:34,722 --> 00:39:36,246
One for you.

517
00:39:43,697 --> 00:39:45,528
You bitch.

518
00:39:45,699 --> 00:39:48,327
Bloody Yankee bitch.

519
00:39:48,502 --> 00:39:52,199
Your daughters are whores, madam.
All of them.

520
00:39:52,373 --> 00:39:53,840
Whores.

521
00:39:54,008 --> 00:39:55,942
-Henry.
-Dear God.

522
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:58,601
-Oh!
-Ahem.

523
00:40:00,514 --> 00:40:03,415
Bastards. I'll show you.

524
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:08,112
Letting the English
swine in my room.

525
00:40:08,289 --> 00:40:10,154
You pigs.

526
00:40:10,391 --> 00:40:12,484
You murderers.
You...

527
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,058
I hate you.

528
00:40:17,364 --> 00:40:19,628
I hate you, Mama and Papa.

529
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,290
Daisy.

530
00:40:24,205 --> 00:40:25,763
There.

531
00:40:30,678 --> 00:40:33,442
Well, I hope you're proud of yourself.

532
00:40:36,217 --> 00:40:39,050
Did you hear what he called you?

533
00:40:39,653 --> 00:40:42,486
Yankee bitch.

534
00:40:42,756 --> 00:40:44,246
Whore.

535
00:40:50,064 --> 00:40:55,092
Whatever you may think, Daisy,
we have always loved you.

536
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:57,499
Your father and l...

537
00:40:58,506 --> 00:41:01,031
...have had such hopes for you.

538
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:07,347
And you've never before given
me cause to feel ashamed of you.

539
00:41:08,582 --> 00:41:10,607
It's not fair.

540
00:41:12,486 --> 00:41:16,320
It's not fair. It's not fair.

541
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,823
After tonight...

542
00:41:24,832 --> 00:41:27,824
...you know where we stand, Daisy.

543
00:41:29,503 --> 00:41:35,635
You cannot belong to this family
and fight on the other side.

544
00:41:36,310 --> 00:41:37,777
I know that.

545
00:41:38,445 --> 00:41:41,005
You make up your mind.

546
00:41:50,991 --> 00:41:52,151
I have.

547
00:41:56,495 --> 00:41:58,258
Form into your companies.

548
00:42:01,967 --> 00:42:03,525
Come on.

549
00:42:04,703 --> 00:42:08,161
-We got a pig.
-Put that pig down.

550
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,501
Come back here.

551
00:42:11,476 --> 00:42:14,240
-Get that boy.
-You bastard. That's our dinner.

552
00:42:14,413 --> 00:42:17,405
-Give me the gun to shoot the pig.
-I got a grenade.

553
00:42:17,583 --> 00:42:19,710
I feel that Ned's growing beyond me.

554
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:22,649
-Get on the cart.
-Steady. Steady.

555
00:42:24,189 --> 00:42:26,714
I see him scant of the time now.

556
00:42:26,892 --> 00:42:29,554
And it hurts hard to see
the sweetness of his youth...

557
00:42:29,728 --> 00:42:32,424
...being lost in this
damn devil's fight.

558
00:42:32,598 --> 00:42:34,088
Come on,
let's get out of here.

559
00:42:34,266 --> 00:42:38,293
I'm alone and lonely without him.

560
00:42:38,470 --> 00:42:40,768
-Over here.
-I stole a pig.

561
00:42:40,939 --> 00:42:44,534
-Good, we eat.
-It got away. I fumbled it.

562
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,439
You fumbled it?

563
00:42:47,713 --> 00:42:50,238
Dick stole a grenade
for us Mohawks...

564
00:42:50,415 --> 00:42:53,680
...so we can blow a hole
in the sergeant's mess.

565
00:42:54,653 --> 00:42:56,985
You ain't blowing nothing.
You ain't no Mohawk.

566
00:42:57,155 --> 00:43:00,181
Well, I am now, Pa.
They just elected me to the gang.

567
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:02,850
What are you talking about?
You wanna get killed?

568
00:43:03,028 --> 00:43:05,963
No, I ain't blowing no grenade.
Dick's blowing the grenade.

569
00:43:06,131 --> 00:43:08,793
Then all of us are gonna go
in there and get all the eats.

570
00:43:08,967 --> 00:43:11,902
What eats? Eats? What eats?
You eat, Ned.

571
00:43:12,070 --> 00:43:13,401
I work for your eats.

572
00:43:13,572 --> 00:43:16,803
-It's not for me. It's for Merle and them.
-I don't care who it's for.

573
00:43:16,975 --> 00:43:20,536
You ain't no Mohawk and you
ain't blowing no grenade, you hear?

574
00:43:20,712 --> 00:43:22,839
-Well, I'm going.
-No, you ain't going nowhere.

575
00:43:23,015 --> 00:43:25,074
-I go where I want.
-No, you're staying here.

576
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,512
Ned, listen.

577
00:43:26,685 --> 00:43:29,017
You've seen them bodies
floating in the river?

578
00:43:29,187 --> 00:43:30,814
You seen them?

579
00:43:32,424 --> 00:43:33,891
What are they?

580
00:43:34,459 --> 00:43:36,324
They're just boys like you.

581
00:43:36,495 --> 00:43:38,588
That's all they are.
Is that what you want?

582
00:43:38,764 --> 00:43:40,231
In here.

583
00:43:40,899 --> 00:43:42,457
-Stand clear.
-All right.

584
00:43:42,634 --> 00:43:44,033
Move.

585
00:43:44,202 --> 00:43:48,935
Well, well. We've got ourselves
a likely looking candidate.

586
00:43:49,107 --> 00:43:51,268
Yes, you.

587
00:43:53,512 --> 00:43:55,139
Are you fit?

588
00:43:55,881 --> 00:43:59,408
Well, you look fit. You're fit.

589
00:44:00,052 --> 00:44:03,112
What about legs?
Can he move his legs, corporal?

590
00:44:03,288 --> 00:44:04,482
Ask him to move his legs.

591
00:44:04,656 --> 00:44:07,124
Get your legs up.
On the spot. Running on the spot.

592
00:44:07,292 --> 00:44:08,316
Up, up, up.

593
00:44:08,493 --> 00:44:10,552
-Up, up, up.
-Left, right, left, right, left.

594
00:44:10,996 --> 00:44:12,554
Get them arms up.
Legs up.

595
00:44:12,731 --> 00:44:16,929
-Up, up, up.
-Left, right, left, right, left.

596
00:44:17,569 --> 00:44:19,196
All right, all right, that'll do.

597
00:44:19,371 --> 00:44:23,205
You and Clowski get to drag the guy.

598
00:44:25,344 --> 00:44:27,608
What are you gawping at, you lot?

599
00:44:29,214 --> 00:44:32,274
This, you dumb Yankees...

600
00:44:32,451 --> 00:44:34,316
...is the guy.

601
00:44:34,486 --> 00:44:35,953
And it's for the officers.

602
00:44:36,121 --> 00:44:39,887
On account, they want a bloody fox hunt
before they ride off to their bloody war.

603
00:44:40,058 --> 00:44:42,583
But there ain't any foxes
in this part of the world.

604
00:44:42,761 --> 00:44:46,197
I daresay, you've ate them all.

605
00:44:48,233 --> 00:44:52,101
So these two get to drag the hunt...

606
00:44:52,270 --> 00:44:58,072
...using this ropey-looking effigy
of dear old Georgie Washington there.

607
00:44:58,877 --> 00:45:02,005
But if you've got any ideas
about running off, forget them...

608
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:07,140
...because when we catch up with you,
and we will, we'll hang you.

609
00:45:07,552 --> 00:45:10,612
Understood?
Right, corporal, bring them on.

610
00:45:10,789 --> 00:45:12,450
Right. The pay's 2 coppers.

611
00:45:12,624 --> 00:45:15,457
One now, one when you're finished,
if the dogs don't eat you.

612
00:45:15,627 --> 00:45:18,892
Come on over there. I want
another man on this pump now. Move.

613
00:45:19,064 --> 00:45:20,088
Get us a sausage.

614
00:45:20,265 --> 00:45:22,995
No. I won't get you no sausage.
Get your own.

615
00:45:23,168 --> 00:45:25,363
You toady to these bugs
like they was tin Jesus.

616
00:45:25,537 --> 00:45:29,132
-It's just to keep you safe.
-Me, Pa, I can watch out for myself.

617
00:45:29,307 --> 00:45:32,606
-It's you who wants to keep low.
-That ain't right to say to me, Ned.

618
00:45:32,778 --> 00:45:35,645
Ain't me hiding.
It was you who run and me you dragged.

619
00:45:35,814 --> 00:45:37,372
Ned. Ned.

620
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:39,710
-Ned.
-Take care of yourself, Pa.

621
00:45:39,885 --> 00:45:42,683
Stick with the officers.
You won't risk getting hurt.

622
00:45:42,854 --> 00:45:45,789
Away from that door. Come here.
Where do you think you're going?

623
00:45:48,827 --> 00:45:50,658
Where'd you think
you were going, eh?

624
00:45:51,863 --> 00:45:53,524
You say something?

625
00:45:53,732 --> 00:45:54,994
-No.
-Did you say something?

626
00:45:55,167 --> 00:45:56,361
Talking about an officer?

627
00:45:56,535 --> 00:45:58,400
-I could charge you for that.
-Come on.

628
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:01,038
-Bring him out. Follow me.
-Out. Move.

629
00:46:01,206 --> 00:46:04,334
You there, fall in. Move it.

630
00:46:05,277 --> 00:46:08,838
Let's get this pair down to the field.
Come on, come on. Move along.

631
00:46:19,991 --> 00:46:21,686
Are these the men, sergeant major?

632
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:25,318
-Yes, sir.
-I see. Well, get them scented up.

633
00:46:25,497 --> 00:46:27,624
You heard what the captain said.
Scent them up.

634
00:46:27,799 --> 00:46:31,860
Now, look,
you're being paid handsomely for this...

635
00:46:32,037 --> 00:46:35,438
...and we want some good sport,
so see you earn your money.

636
00:46:36,441 --> 00:46:38,272
Right, sergeant major.

637
00:46:38,443 --> 00:46:40,502
-Run them bloody off.
-Very good, sir.

638
00:46:40,679 --> 00:46:43,307
Here's your pass.
Gets you through the lines. Off you go.

639
00:46:43,482 --> 00:46:46,007
All right. Away you go.
Come on, move. Move. Move it.

640
00:46:46,184 --> 00:46:51,019
-Move. Move it along.
-Give them a good start, master.

641
00:46:51,189 --> 00:46:53,350
Hold back, hold back.

642
00:46:53,525 --> 00:46:54,958
Get them away.

643
00:46:55,126 --> 00:46:58,562
Ten sovereigns,
the big one doesn't last the course.

644
00:46:58,730 --> 00:47:00,994
It's the little man
you have to watch out for.

645
00:47:01,166 --> 00:47:04,135
You make one ashamed,
hunting with men.

646
00:48:22,213 --> 00:48:25,876
-No more.
-No, it's not far. It's not far.

647
00:48:26,251 --> 00:48:27,946
No.

648
00:48:28,119 --> 00:48:30,110
Listen, the water's there.

649
00:48:31,623 --> 00:48:33,113
We gotta get the water on it.

650
00:48:33,291 --> 00:48:35,851
-It's not far.
-No water.

651
00:48:36,628 --> 00:48:38,186
It's right there.

652
00:48:40,532 --> 00:48:44,298
-Free.
-ldiot. Idiot.

653
00:48:56,748 --> 00:48:58,841
You got the scent on you.

654
00:48:59,017 --> 00:49:01,008
-I don't care.
-They're gonna run you down.

655
00:49:01,186 --> 00:49:03,746
-You got the scent on you.
-I don't care.

656
00:49:43,795 --> 00:49:45,763
Have they lost the beggar?

657
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:57,838
Nothing down there.

658
00:50:00,345 --> 00:50:04,975
A strange and cruel thing to die
a hunter of animals for means to live...

659
00:50:05,150 --> 00:50:08,119
...and now the animal hunted.

660
00:50:08,553 --> 00:50:10,453
All for the foolish sport of kings.

661
00:50:11,523 --> 00:50:16,551
I am made prideless,
crawling to survive for my Ned's life.

662
00:50:22,901 --> 00:50:24,562
-Divide and rule, eh?
-Come on.

663
00:50:24,736 --> 00:50:26,101
What?

664
00:50:26,471 --> 00:50:28,803
Now let's get the one
running with the fox.

665
00:51:17,255 --> 00:51:19,223
Come on, you bastards.

666
00:51:38,810 --> 00:51:39,868
Call off the dogs.

667
00:51:40,912 --> 00:51:44,006
Good heavens, it's not.
It can't be.

668
00:51:44,415 --> 00:51:48,476
Oh, look,
it's poor old Georgie Washington.

669
00:51:48,653 --> 00:51:51,349
Poor old chap
seems to have run out of puff.

670
00:51:52,524 --> 00:51:56,392
-Hold it. Hold it, then, hold it.
-Developing a soft spot for him, are we?

671
00:51:58,229 --> 00:52:01,198
I think we'll have to
put him out of his misery.

672
00:52:12,243 --> 00:52:15,974
And so ends the American dream,
eh, what?

673
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:22,413
-Come on, tallyho.
-Damn fine ride.

674
00:52:37,001 --> 00:52:40,493
"...valley of the shadow of death,
I will fear no evil, for thou are with me.

675
00:52:40,672 --> 00:52:43,607
Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.

676
00:52:43,775 --> 00:52:47,211
Thou preparest a table before me
in the presence of mine enemies.

677
00:52:47,378 --> 00:52:50,643
Thou anointest my head with oil,
my cup runneth over.

678
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:54,444
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me all the days of my life.

679
00:52:54,619 --> 00:52:58,749
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever."

680
00:52:59,457 --> 00:53:00,890
Amen.

681
00:53:02,827 --> 00:53:06,661
-They're all gone now, Bill?
-Well, they're sleeping, Ben.

682
00:53:06,831 --> 00:53:09,595
-Just sleeping.
-Put to bed with a mattock.

683
00:53:09,767 --> 00:53:11,598
Tucked in with a spade.

684
00:53:20,078 --> 00:53:23,445
-It's me going next.
-No, you have drummers' luck.

685
00:53:23,615 --> 00:53:25,583
-Like you.
-Aye. Like him.

686
00:53:25,750 --> 00:53:28,514
You can't fight a war
without drummer boys, son.

687
00:53:28,686 --> 00:53:30,950
Now we'll get some more.

688
00:53:31,656 --> 00:53:33,021
Ben.

689
00:53:49,607 --> 00:53:51,165
That's nice.

690
00:53:51,976 --> 00:53:53,534
Good.

691
00:53:55,213 --> 00:53:56,510
-Ned, stop. Stop.
-What?

692
00:53:56,681 --> 00:53:58,012
Look.

693
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:01,313
You're good, son.

694
00:54:01,786 --> 00:54:04,846
-We'll give you a drum of your own.
-Ahh!

695
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:10,449
Cross me, and I'll pop out your glim.

696
00:54:10,628 --> 00:54:12,357
Corporal.

697
00:54:12,697 --> 00:54:14,062
Here.

698
00:54:14,332 --> 00:54:17,233
-Come on, lad. On your feet.
-You just got lucky.

699
00:54:17,635 --> 00:54:19,193
Move.

700
00:54:21,005 --> 00:54:22,472
Come on.

701
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:25,370
-Come on.
-Come on, me laddie.

702
00:54:40,258 --> 00:54:42,658
Make ready.

703
00:54:43,962 --> 00:54:44,986
Regiment.

704
00:54:45,463 --> 00:54:47,260
-Please let me through.
-Keep quiet.

705
00:54:47,432 --> 00:54:49,764
-I beg of you.
-I don't care. Get back. Come on.

706
00:54:49,934 --> 00:54:52,732
-Just get back. Shut up.
-Let her through.

707
00:55:17,862 --> 00:55:20,524
-Tom.
-It's a Tory chicken.

708
00:55:20,698 --> 00:55:23,132
Have you seen Tom Dobb?

709
00:55:24,702 --> 00:55:26,329
Does Tom Dobb work here?

710
00:55:26,504 --> 00:55:29,735
Five, five, I want five. I want five.
Give me five, give me five.

711
00:55:29,907 --> 00:55:31,807
-Give me five.
-Five, five. I got five.

712
00:55:32,877 --> 00:55:34,674
Anyone else? Five, five.
Give us five.

713
00:55:34,846 --> 00:55:37,280
Four, four, four,
I want four. I want four.

714
00:55:37,448 --> 00:55:40,349
-I want four. You betting, lady? Four.
-No.

715
00:55:40,518 --> 00:55:41,542
-Miss Daisy.
-What?

716
00:55:41,719 --> 00:55:42,947
-In there.
-Where?

717
00:55:43,121 --> 00:55:44,952
-In there.
-All right, let them go.

718
00:55:45,123 --> 00:55:48,388
-Form them. That's another one.
-One, two, three.

719
00:56:10,581 --> 00:56:12,242
Tom.

720
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:14,508
Tom.

721
00:56:15,486 --> 00:56:16,748
It's your son.

722
00:56:17,622 --> 00:56:19,055
They took your son.

723
00:56:24,962 --> 00:56:27,328
I saw him taken this
afternoon by the British.

724
00:56:27,498 --> 00:56:30,524
I let him go too far from me.

725
00:56:31,636 --> 00:56:37,871
Everything that was
is now far from me.

726
00:56:40,678 --> 00:56:42,236
They've marched north.

727
00:56:42,413 --> 00:56:44,973
North. We've lost.

728
00:56:45,149 --> 00:56:46,980
Oh, Tom.

729
00:56:47,151 --> 00:56:51,349
I'll find him, Katie, I swear.

730
00:56:53,591 --> 00:56:55,684
God, give me strength.

731
00:57:15,580 --> 00:57:17,844
Tom, what are you doing?

732
00:57:18,416 --> 00:57:20,475
Gonna get a boat.

733
00:57:21,085 --> 00:57:23,417
But you got no weapon.

734
00:57:48,079 --> 00:57:49,842
-Tom.
-Thank you for coming to me.

735
00:57:55,386 --> 00:57:57,445
We could have spoke.

736
00:58:06,230 --> 00:58:09,028
God save you, Tom and Ned.

737
00:58:21,646 --> 00:58:23,671
I'll find you, Ned.

738
00:58:23,848 --> 00:58:27,147
Wherever you be, by God,
I'll find you.

739
00:58:39,063 --> 00:58:43,056
Number three post,
move with 12.

740
00:59:31,148 --> 00:59:34,743
-You got it.
-Sergeant major.

741
00:59:40,691 --> 00:59:42,124
His Lordship wants a boy...

742
00:59:43,461 --> 00:59:46,259
...to polish his boots.

743
00:59:48,366 --> 00:59:49,799
Come on then.

744
00:59:53,771 --> 00:59:55,864
Go on, go on.

745
01:00:08,686 --> 01:00:10,711
Hello, Ben.

746
01:00:14,292 --> 01:00:17,489
Ah. A new boy.

747
01:00:18,996 --> 01:00:20,827
Well.

748
01:00:22,233 --> 01:00:24,963
You.

749
01:00:26,203 --> 01:00:27,670
Come.

750
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:31,401
Ah! You bugger.

751
01:00:31,842 --> 01:00:33,036
Sergeant major.

752
01:00:33,844 --> 01:00:34,868
Sir?

753
01:00:36,213 --> 01:00:38,272
The gunner's daughter.

754
01:00:41,585 --> 01:00:43,018
Sir.

755
01:00:43,688 --> 01:00:45,019
Here.

756
01:00:45,690 --> 01:00:48,250
-You others can witness this.
-Let me go.

757
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:51,484
Boys.

758
01:01:03,307 --> 01:01:05,901
Now, me little fish.

759
01:01:06,077 --> 01:01:09,604
See what's come to us.
See what you've done.

760
01:01:12,450 --> 01:01:13,576
Get his boots off.

761
01:01:13,751 --> 01:01:15,343
Wonder who he picked on this time.

762
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:17,714
-Christ, he's only a boy.
-Heave it up.

763
01:01:35,940 --> 01:01:38,238
Hold him steady.

764
01:01:50,755 --> 01:01:53,053
You let him alone.

765
01:01:56,560 --> 01:01:58,221
Follow me.

766
01:02:10,808 --> 01:02:12,503
Please.

767
01:03:07,798 --> 01:03:10,733
Ben, go to bed.

768
01:03:10,935 --> 01:03:12,664
-Want some booze, Bill?
-Three knaves.

769
01:03:15,339 --> 01:03:16,499
Cheating, Jesse?

770
01:03:16,674 --> 01:03:19,643
Come on, don't take
all night. Come on, lay a card.

771
01:03:19,810 --> 01:03:22,404
-Oh, blimey, look at this.
-What you got?

772
01:03:23,914 --> 01:03:25,643
Beat you again.

773
01:03:35,626 --> 01:03:37,651
-Ned, Ned, it's me.
-Pa.

774
01:03:37,828 --> 01:03:39,591
Oh, Ned.

775
01:03:41,131 --> 01:03:42,860
Oh, Ned.

776
01:03:43,367 --> 01:03:45,562
Oh, God,
what have they done to you?

777
01:03:45,736 --> 01:03:48,534
Oh, Ned. You're safe now, son.

778
01:03:52,877 --> 01:03:54,936
I'll take care of you now, son.

779
01:03:55,212 --> 01:03:58,375
I'll cut you free.
I'll cut you free.

780
01:04:10,961 --> 01:04:15,295
Take Merle, Pa.
He helped me. Please.

781
01:04:15,966 --> 01:04:17,763
Take Merle.

782
01:04:18,802 --> 01:04:21,293
Can you walk?
Oh, God.

783
01:04:21,472 --> 01:04:23,303
-I got you, Ned.
-Pa.

784
01:04:23,474 --> 01:04:25,840
-Here, let me take you.
-Please take Merle.

785
01:04:26,010 --> 01:04:27,170
He tried to help.

786
01:04:28,612 --> 01:04:30,204
Come on.

787
01:04:52,703 --> 01:04:56,639
Oh, no, where is it?
What was given me to get through.

788
01:04:57,708 --> 01:05:00,700
Oh, yes. The crown. Here.

789
01:05:13,490 --> 01:05:16,926
-They hurt, Pa.
-I know, son, I know.

790
01:05:17,361 --> 01:05:19,386
I got you. God.

791
01:05:20,764 --> 01:05:22,425
It's all right.

792
01:05:22,800 --> 01:05:24,495
I got you.

793
01:05:40,985 --> 01:05:42,782
Ben.

794
01:05:43,554 --> 01:05:44,748
Ben.

795
01:05:45,255 --> 01:05:47,120
Ben.

796
01:05:53,998 --> 01:05:56,364
Where'd they go, son?

797
01:05:58,268 --> 01:06:02,466
You know, Ben.
Now, where'd they go?

798
01:06:05,609 --> 01:06:09,067
-They was tooken, Bill.
-By who, tooken?

799
01:06:10,848 --> 01:06:15,478
-lt was a man who came and took them.
-You made no alarm?

800
01:06:19,390 --> 01:06:20,914
I didn't mean to.

801
01:06:21,592 --> 01:06:24,618
I didn't mean to. I thought
you liked him better than me.

802
01:06:24,795 --> 01:06:26,990
Ben, Ben.
You'll always be dear to me, Ben.

803
01:06:27,164 --> 01:06:28,756
Now, go on.

804
01:06:30,768 --> 01:06:33,100
-Pike.
-Sir.

805
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,445
My knife.

806
01:06:45,783 --> 01:06:48,616
Give it to who brings back me boys.

807
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:51,283
Now, go on.

808
01:06:56,393 --> 01:06:57,860
Sir.

809
01:07:42,740 --> 01:07:44,332
Oh, Ned.

810
01:07:51,815 --> 01:07:54,943
Here. You gotta keep awake, son.

811
01:07:55,119 --> 01:07:57,747
You got to keep awake.

812
01:08:14,471 --> 01:08:16,029
Wait!

813
01:08:26,550 --> 01:08:28,108
Over there. You go over.

814
01:08:28,285 --> 01:08:30,810
Oh, what means to safety now?

815
01:08:31,455 --> 01:08:33,116
How to leave this place?

816
01:08:33,290 --> 01:08:35,758
I know it well in peace time
for all I hunted...

817
01:08:35,926 --> 01:08:42,161
...but now with its sharp, rocky hills,
it's enemy land.

818
01:10:09,686 --> 01:10:11,620
Tom, sir.

819
01:10:52,429 --> 01:10:53,453
American.

820
01:10:54,631 --> 01:10:56,223
I hate les Anglais.

821
01:10:57,301 --> 01:11:00,668
I hate lroquois. They kill Huron.

822
01:11:01,405 --> 01:11:04,169
My father sont Francais.

823
01:11:04,508 --> 01:11:07,705
Mama, she was Huron.

824
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:14,048
The man who kill my enemy...

825
01:11:14,851 --> 01:11:16,944
...is my friend.

826
01:11:34,504 --> 01:11:39,407
A real feeling of kin and sameness
come over me for these colored men.

827
01:11:39,576 --> 01:11:41,203
These natives of this country...

828
01:11:41,378 --> 01:11:44,711
...who try to remain
where and what they be.

829
01:11:45,248 --> 01:11:49,514
It carries me in my mind
to my early years.

830
01:11:49,886 --> 01:11:53,845
Taken as a young ignorant from
my frighted folk in this new land...

831
01:11:54,024 --> 01:11:59,189
...sold for a few coin of the realm
and a written paper...

832
01:11:59,363 --> 01:12:02,127
...binding me to be a worker
for my food bed...

833
01:12:02,299 --> 01:12:07,635
... till I came in age when the paper said
I were no longer bound.

834
01:12:10,674 --> 01:12:16,271
And now a memory also of how I felt
akin to the black slaves at those days.

835
01:12:16,446 --> 01:12:22,078
Though no folk of them was given coin,
and no paper freed them after any time.

836
01:12:23,286 --> 01:12:25,083
Those things of old...

837
01:12:25,255 --> 01:12:28,622
...have gone almost complete
from my mind...

838
01:12:28,792 --> 01:12:31,124
...now flood back on me.

839
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:08,861
You gotta stay awake, son.

840
01:13:09,032 --> 01:13:11,364
-You gotta stay awake.
-Just hold on.

841
01:13:17,007 --> 01:13:18,736
Pa.

842
01:13:20,377 --> 01:13:22,277
I'm here, Ned.

843
01:13:22,446 --> 01:13:25,381
I got you. I got you.

844
01:13:30,454 --> 01:13:31,853
I got a terrible dream.

845
01:13:33,290 --> 01:13:36,782
-I'm drowning, Pa.
-No, no, no, you ain't.

846
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:39,087
No, you ain't. No, you're here.

847
01:13:40,163 --> 01:13:41,892
Hold my hand.

848
01:13:42,065 --> 01:13:44,625
You hold my hand
like they're rope.

849
01:13:45,435 --> 01:13:46,959
I won't let you sink.

850
01:13:47,604 --> 01:13:49,834
I won't let you sink.

851
01:13:57,981 --> 01:13:59,141
You hear me talking, Ned?

852
01:13:59,316 --> 01:14:00,681
-Yeah.
-Come on, come on.

853
01:14:00,851 --> 01:14:02,978
I'm gonna talk to you now.
I'm gonna tell you...

854
01:14:03,153 --> 01:14:06,213
Tell you about your Ma.
Now, you remember your Ma?

855
01:14:06,389 --> 01:14:08,050
Yeah. You tell me about her.

856
01:14:08,225 --> 01:14:11,126
Come on. You just tell
me what you remember.

857
01:14:11,294 --> 01:14:12,625
The way she smelled.

858
01:14:12,796 --> 01:14:14,229
-Yeah.
-All warm.

859
01:14:14,397 --> 01:14:16,695
-Yeah.
-How she rocked me.

860
01:14:16,867 --> 01:14:18,960
Oh, she loved you, Ned.

861
01:14:19,136 --> 01:14:22,628
-She loved you too, Pa.
-Oh, yeah.

862
01:14:22,973 --> 01:14:24,736
-She died.
-Yeah.

863
01:14:24,908 --> 01:14:27,103
It was fever took her, Ned.

864
01:14:28,278 --> 01:14:32,715
Took everyone. Man, wife,
the Indians, by the thousands.

865
01:14:32,883 --> 01:14:36,785
And your sister, Nell,
and James, your brother...

866
01:14:36,987 --> 01:14:39,285
...and little baby Ann.
Remember Ann, Ned?

867
01:14:39,456 --> 01:14:41,321
Yes, Pa.

868
01:14:44,027 --> 01:14:47,087
It's all right, Ned.
It's all right.

869
01:14:48,965 --> 01:14:51,263
Okay, hold on.
Hold on, hold on.

870
01:14:52,969 --> 01:14:54,561
Here we go. Hold on.

871
01:14:55,972 --> 01:14:57,098
Pa.

872
01:14:58,808 --> 01:15:01,242
I'm with you.
I'm with you.

873
01:15:01,878 --> 01:15:05,712
I'm with you, son.
I'm with you, son.

874
01:15:06,283 --> 01:15:07,682
Ned.

875
01:15:12,222 --> 01:15:14,713
Oh, Ned. Oh, Ned.

876
01:15:15,192 --> 01:15:17,786
Bite on it, Ned. Bite on it.

877
01:15:21,765 --> 01:15:23,562
There, Ned.

878
01:15:24,568 --> 01:15:26,934
That's it, Ned.
They're finished.

879
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,537
Ned. Ned.

880
01:15:29,706 --> 01:15:31,071
-There.
-Pa.

881
01:15:31,241 --> 01:15:32,572
-Yes.
-Pa?

882
01:15:32,742 --> 01:15:35,074
Yeah. Yes?

883
01:15:35,245 --> 01:15:38,373
-You saved me, Pa?
-Yeah.

884
01:15:38,548 --> 01:15:39,708
Yes.

885
01:15:39,883 --> 01:15:41,612
-Pa.
-Yes.

886
01:15:42,052 --> 01:15:46,751
-I thought you was a coward.
-You did, Ned? You thought that?

887
01:15:46,923 --> 01:15:49,687
-But you ain't a coward.
-No, I ain't.

888
01:15:50,093 --> 01:15:53,426
I was, Ned. I was.

889
01:15:53,964 --> 01:15:57,798
It was me got you in this mess.
What'd I do that for?

890
01:15:57,968 --> 01:16:00,528
-Pa.
-It was needing you, Ned.

891
01:16:00,704 --> 01:16:02,001
It was just needing you.

892
01:16:02,172 --> 01:16:03,434
-Needing to hold you.
-Pa.

893
01:16:03,607 --> 01:16:06,007
You're my son.
That's all I got.

894
01:16:06,176 --> 01:16:07,302
Pa.

895
01:16:07,477 --> 01:16:09,206
-I'm drowning, Pa.
-No.

896
01:16:09,379 --> 01:16:11,506
-Pa.
-No, no, no.

897
01:16:11,681 --> 01:16:14,707
No, don't sink.
Don't fall on me. Don't drown.

898
01:16:14,884 --> 01:16:19,082
No, Ned. Damn you, Ned.
Damn you, Ned. No, no.

899
01:16:19,256 --> 01:16:21,451
Pa. Pa.

900
01:16:21,625 --> 01:16:24,958
Can't you feel me rock you?
I'm rocking you.

901
01:16:25,128 --> 01:16:27,824
I'll rock you like
when you was my baby.

902
01:16:27,998 --> 01:16:30,489
-Oh, Ned.
-Pa.

903
01:16:30,667 --> 01:16:33,033
Oh, Ned.
I'll rock you now.

904
01:16:33,203 --> 01:16:35,967
-Come on, Ned.
-Are we on the river?

905
01:16:37,107 --> 01:16:39,541
No, Ned. No.

906
01:16:39,843 --> 01:16:41,743
-I can feel it moving.
-No.

907
01:16:41,911 --> 01:16:43,572
It's just me rocking you.

908
01:16:43,747 --> 01:16:45,374
I'm gonna keep rocking you.

909
01:16:45,548 --> 01:16:49,780
Just rocking you back and forth
like when you was my little baby.

910
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,818
Where are we going, Pa?

911
01:16:53,623 --> 01:16:55,284
We're going...

912
01:16:56,092 --> 01:16:57,389
...somewhere.

913
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:59,528
Somewhere new.

914
01:17:01,531 --> 01:17:04,432
-What's it like?
-Oh, I don't know.

915
01:17:04,601 --> 01:17:06,899
It's like nowhere else.

916
01:17:08,004 --> 01:17:11,064
-Please tell me, Pa.
-I'll tell you.

917
01:17:11,875 --> 01:17:13,570
I'll tell you.

918
01:17:15,111 --> 01:17:17,443
We're gonna find us a place...

919
01:17:18,181 --> 01:17:20,706
...where there ain't no one
to bow down to.

920
01:17:21,885 --> 01:17:25,514
Where there ain't no
lord or lady better than you.

921
01:17:26,456 --> 01:17:31,484
Where you can say what you like
and climb as high as you want.

922
01:17:31,661 --> 01:17:36,360
And there ain't nobody gonna
treat no one like a dog in the dirt.

923
01:17:38,568 --> 01:17:42,334
I look around me, Ned,
and I see all kinds of people.

924
01:17:42,505 --> 01:17:44,234
Men, women.

925
01:17:44,974 --> 01:17:47,340
And they got families like mine.

926
01:17:48,044 --> 01:17:52,310
And we all stand together
like brothers and sisters.

927
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:56,646
And we make a place for ourselves.

928
01:17:57,320 --> 01:18:01,620
We'll make a place where our babies
can sleep safe through the night.

929
01:18:01,791 --> 01:18:04,157
Are we there, Pa?

930
01:18:05,328 --> 01:18:07,626
We're almost there, Ned.

931
01:18:10,533 --> 01:18:11,864
You come through, Ned.

932
01:18:12,035 --> 01:18:16,028
I spake words to Ned
I did not know were in me.

933
01:18:16,239 --> 01:18:20,335
And now with them said, I am new.

934
01:18:20,510 --> 01:18:23,707
And there's new purpose
in this bloody and uneven fight.

935
01:18:25,448 --> 01:18:29,441
I can now see what parted
Ned from me these many a month.

936
01:18:29,619 --> 01:18:34,283
He knew deep in him
this land of his birth was home.

937
01:18:34,591 --> 01:18:36,149
Hyah!

938
01:18:39,562 --> 01:18:41,496
Cuffy, the flag.

939
01:18:47,604 --> 01:18:50,072
-Halt.
-Whoa.

940
01:18:52,242 --> 01:18:55,734
-Where's your tally?
-Whoa.

941
01:19:00,884 --> 01:19:01,942
-Here.
-All right.

942
01:19:02,118 --> 01:19:03,517
Thank you.

943
01:19:04,187 --> 01:19:06,883
All right, let's go. Go on.

944
01:19:07,924 --> 01:19:09,585
Come on, go.

945
01:19:10,226 --> 01:19:14,094
-I'm coming to get some.
-Hey, wait for me.

946
01:19:14,597 --> 01:19:16,428
-Corn.
-Corn.

947
01:19:16,599 --> 01:19:18,692
Food.

948
01:19:24,808 --> 01:19:27,276
Come on, food.

949
01:19:27,444 --> 01:19:29,969
-The food is here.
-Hello, there.

950
01:19:30,146 --> 01:19:31,977
Oh, sergeant.

951
01:19:32,148 --> 01:19:34,514
You got any tobacco?

952
01:19:35,118 --> 01:19:36,278
Yeah, I got some tobacco.

953
01:19:36,453 --> 01:19:38,546
-Come on, keep them moving.
-Hoped you might.

954
01:19:38,721 --> 01:19:40,416
Come on, move on.
Come on up here.

955
01:19:40,590 --> 01:19:42,023
-What else you bring?
-Move.

956
01:19:42,192 --> 01:19:44,092
Come on, Charlie,
food's arrived.

957
01:19:44,260 --> 01:19:47,752
-Come on. Help me get it unloaded.
-Two pigs, three sheep...

958
01:19:47,931 --> 01:19:49,660
-...three barrels of fish.
-Right.

959
01:19:49,833 --> 01:19:53,269
As much cheese as we
could lay hands on.

960
01:19:56,005 --> 01:19:59,600
There's also sour grass, chamomile
and mistletoe for the medicine chest.

961
01:19:59,776 --> 01:20:01,004
Get these goods unloaded.

962
01:20:01,177 --> 01:20:03,543
Captain Cray,
here's a team and wagon, sir.

963
01:20:03,713 --> 01:20:05,578
Is there anything
I can do to help you?

964
01:20:07,951 --> 01:20:09,316
I'll need you and your carts.

965
01:20:09,486 --> 01:20:13,684
I've got sick men to be taken
to the hospital at Yellow Springs.

966
01:20:16,459 --> 01:20:19,019
Water. Water.

967
01:20:19,195 --> 01:20:22,426
Doctor,
this wound is festering badly.

968
01:20:22,599 --> 01:20:25,329
-Sergeant.
-Yes, ma'am.

969
01:20:25,535 --> 01:20:27,901
-These men are dying.
-That's why they must go.

970
01:20:28,071 --> 01:20:29,504
There's food, just arrived.

971
01:20:29,672 --> 01:20:32,334
The general don't want
no men dying at Valley Forge.

972
01:20:32,509 --> 01:20:34,704
Get them loaded now, sergeant.

973
01:20:34,878 --> 01:20:36,345
Yes, sir.

974
01:20:36,513 --> 01:20:39,073
Corporal,
get the stretcher cases over here.

975
01:20:39,249 --> 01:20:41,308
-Get this man bandaged.
-You, go with him.

976
01:20:41,484 --> 01:20:44,112
-I want him ready to be moved.
-All right, now, move.

977
01:20:44,287 --> 01:20:47,848
Those men that are able to be moved,
I want them on this wagon ready to roll.

978
01:20:48,024 --> 01:20:51,460
I know you. Miss New York.

979
01:20:51,628 --> 01:20:53,926
You wouldn't come to war.

980
01:20:54,230 --> 01:20:57,597
-Well, I've come now.
-So you have.

981
01:20:57,767 --> 01:20:59,962
I remember you.

982
01:21:00,603 --> 01:21:04,903
-You had a fella.
-Bill was killed at Trenton.

983
01:21:05,508 --> 01:21:07,066
Nurse, for God's sake.

984
01:21:07,243 --> 01:21:08,835
-Is that his son?
-Don't move.

985
01:21:09,012 --> 01:21:11,572
-Yes. And I'm heavy with Jack's now.
-Nurse.

986
01:21:11,748 --> 01:21:13,409
Daisy?

987
01:21:14,384 --> 01:21:15,976
Daisy.

988
01:21:16,352 --> 01:21:18,320
It's me, Ned.

989
01:21:21,491 --> 01:21:24,983
Ned. Oh, Ned.

990
01:21:25,161 --> 01:21:27,425
God, you're safe.

991
01:21:27,597 --> 01:21:30,998
God, you've grown. Look at you.

992
01:21:31,935 --> 01:21:33,527
Oh, my God.

993
01:21:33,703 --> 01:21:36,297
-Look at you. You got a rifle.
-Yeah.

994
01:21:36,472 --> 01:21:37,837
We're scouts now.

995
01:21:38,007 --> 01:21:39,668
-My mother once told me...
-Scouts?

996
01:21:39,842 --> 01:21:41,469
Mm.

997
01:21:44,948 --> 01:21:48,406
-Where's your dad, Ned?
-Over in the hut.

998
01:21:50,920 --> 01:21:52,251
Oh.

999
01:21:54,624 --> 01:21:58,219
One, two, one, two, one, two.

1000
01:22:06,102 --> 01:22:08,366
Pa, look who's here.

1001
01:22:17,647 --> 01:22:19,877
What have I to say to her?

1002
01:22:20,049 --> 01:22:25,681
This woman I took to be a girl of
fantasy playing at a toy-soldier war.

1003
01:22:26,322 --> 01:22:31,316
Through all the thunder of battle,
soft and smiling she appears still...

1004
01:22:31,494 --> 01:22:33,860
...like a guiding angel.

1005
01:22:37,433 --> 01:22:40,027
God, I prayed for you, Tom.

1006
01:22:41,204 --> 01:22:42,831
I prayed for you so much.

1007
01:22:49,979 --> 01:22:51,003
You got thin.

1008
01:22:51,814 --> 01:22:53,941
A soldier' s life.

1009
01:22:59,255 --> 01:23:01,553
Come on. Oh, you're cold.

1010
01:23:05,662 --> 01:23:07,857
Here. Ain't got much.

1011
01:23:08,398 --> 01:23:10,628
Some pumpkin soup.

1012
01:23:11,634 --> 01:23:14,364
Ain't much in it, but it's warm.

1013
01:23:15,471 --> 01:23:16,938
Here.

1014
01:23:20,309 --> 01:23:22,004
I got salt.

1015
01:23:22,178 --> 01:23:24,339
-You got salt?
-Yeah.

1016
01:23:30,853 --> 01:23:32,320
Here.

1017
01:23:34,390 --> 01:23:36,187
That's good.

1018
01:23:37,260 --> 01:23:39,251
Sit here.

1019
01:23:40,997 --> 01:23:43,727
Oh, your feet must be ice.

1020
01:23:43,900 --> 01:23:46,596
Heaven above,
how light shines in her tired eyes.

1021
01:23:46,769 --> 01:23:48,293
-Come here.
-You're an Indian now.

1022
01:23:48,471 --> 01:23:50,996
-This well-born New York Joan of Arc...
-I'm a scout.

1023
01:23:51,174 --> 01:23:56,043
...throwing away all comfort to
tread this muddy hell to reach us...

1024
01:23:56,212 --> 01:24:00,308
...time and again
with her burning purpose of liberty.

1025
01:24:05,455 --> 01:24:06,922
Here.

1026
01:24:16,365 --> 01:24:19,163
God, I never thought
I'd see you again.

1027
01:24:26,509 --> 01:24:29,672
Tell me, Daisy.
What happened to you?

1028
01:24:32,482 --> 01:24:36,976
Well, Cuffy and I, we left New York
and fled to Philadelphia...

1029
01:24:37,153 --> 01:24:40,281
...where there were partisans,
and we joined them.

1030
01:24:40,456 --> 01:24:46,190
And we smuggled food, boots,
muskets, flints.

1031
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:48,961
And I learned how to sail.

1032
01:24:49,565 --> 01:24:51,726
-Did you?
-Yeah, on the Chesapeake.

1033
01:24:54,337 --> 01:24:56,931
I can see you're
wearing a captain's coat.

1034
01:24:57,907 --> 01:25:01,104
It's Captain Stanhope's.
He gave it to me.

1035
01:25:07,717 --> 01:25:09,776
Look at my hands.

1036
01:25:21,230 --> 01:25:23,027
-See how rough they got?
-Oh, yeah.

1037
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:27,226
-Look at the calluses on them.
-It's from the ropes.

1038
01:25:27,837 --> 01:25:29,828
It's from sailing.

1039
01:25:30,239 --> 01:25:31,672
Yeah.

1040
01:25:33,509 --> 01:25:35,943
-They're like mine.
-Yeah.

1041
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:40,245
Where will I find the words?
The courage to tell her?

1042
01:25:43,486 --> 01:25:46,455
I can sail anywhere with you now, Tom.

1043
01:25:48,024 --> 01:25:50,492
Oh, could you, Daisy?

1044
01:25:52,495 --> 01:25:54,429
Yes, I could.

1045
01:25:58,534 --> 01:26:00,934
There's some more if you want it.

1046
01:26:01,571 --> 01:26:03,596
Pa, the wagon's coming.

1047
01:26:09,846 --> 01:26:13,338
You'll be all right at Yellow Springs Hospital.
I'll wait till you get back.

1048
01:26:13,516 --> 01:26:18,146
-See you when you get back.
-Got your wagon ready? Whoa!

1049
01:26:24,760 --> 01:26:27,923
Cuffy, this is Tom.

1050
01:26:28,397 --> 01:26:29,421
Tom, this is Cuffy.

1051
01:26:29,599 --> 01:26:31,590
-Pleased to meet you.
-Mr. Tom.

1052
01:26:32,435 --> 01:26:35,836
-Wait, I got something for you.
-Get that wagon rolling.

1053
01:26:36,005 --> 01:26:37,029
I'm Bella.

1054
01:26:37,206 --> 01:26:39,731
-My father's lsrael Davis, the gunner.
-Come on, walk.

1055
01:26:39,909 --> 01:26:41,900
-Just a minute.
-I'm staying here with him.

1056
01:26:42,078 --> 01:26:44,012
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Ned.

1057
01:26:44,180 --> 01:26:46,614
-Pleased to meet you, Ned.
-This will keep you warm.

1058
01:26:46,782 --> 01:26:49,751
-Oh, thank you, Tom.
-All right, let's go. Come on, come on.

1059
01:26:49,919 --> 01:26:52,387
-Let's move out.
-Pack my stuff for me.

1060
01:26:52,555 --> 01:26:54,318
Yeah, just a moment, Pa. Come on.

1061
01:26:54,490 --> 01:26:56,253
-You've got a limp.
-Oh, it's nothing.

1062
01:26:56,425 --> 01:26:59,622
-Were you wounded?
-I was captured, but my Pa saved me.

1063
01:27:00,229 --> 01:27:04,325
Are you going back to Philadelphia
after you take them to the hospital?

1064
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:06,292
I don't know.

1065
01:27:06,469 --> 01:27:08,699
I go where they tell me.

1066
01:27:09,038 --> 01:27:10,096
Where are you gonna be?

1067
01:27:10,273 --> 01:27:13,834
-I don't know. I'm gonna...
-I love you, Daniel.

1068
01:27:15,578 --> 01:27:19,981
Well, I'll be scouting here all winter.
After that, I don't know.

1069
01:27:20,149 --> 01:27:22,743
Indians wanna go
back to their families.

1070
01:27:22,919 --> 01:27:24,716
Me, I don't know.

1071
01:27:25,721 --> 01:27:27,154
Bye, I'll miss you.

1072
01:27:27,323 --> 01:27:29,723
You named your horses yet, Daisy?

1073
01:27:29,892 --> 01:27:32,520
Yeah, this is Fast and this is Faster.

1074
01:27:32,695 --> 01:27:36,062
I cannot let her go
without saying or asking.

1075
01:27:36,866 --> 01:27:39,994
God, give me words
to show her my heart.

1076
01:27:40,169 --> 01:27:42,160
Quickly, before she goes again.

1077
01:27:42,338 --> 01:27:43,828
You can't come.

1078
01:27:44,006 --> 01:27:46,236
-Is it this sailor that she speaks of?
-Daisy.

1079
01:27:46,409 --> 01:27:49,810
-This Captain Stanhope?
-The guy who gave you the coat.

1080
01:27:50,913 --> 01:27:53,848
The captain.
He the one that learnt you to sail?

1081
01:27:54,016 --> 01:27:56,678
-Yes, he did.
-He's a good sailor?

1082
01:27:56,852 --> 01:27:58,945
Yes, he is.

1083
01:27:59,956 --> 01:28:02,356
He's in Philadelphia now?

1084
01:28:03,626 --> 01:28:06,151
-No.
-That's as far as you go, scout.

1085
01:28:06,329 --> 01:28:09,924
-You gonna marry him?
-No.

1086
01:28:10,099 --> 01:28:14,126
Only you, Tom Dobb.
Only you.

1087
01:28:34,690 --> 01:28:37,056
Charge.

1088
01:28:38,294 --> 01:28:40,626
Turn that wagon.

1089
01:28:51,841 --> 01:28:55,368
-Hold on, Cuffy.
-Faster, they're gaining on us.

1090
01:29:12,962 --> 01:29:16,762
-They're coming quick. Faster.
-No, go.

1091
01:29:23,005 --> 01:29:24,495
Faster.

1092
01:29:25,875 --> 01:29:27,672
Go!

1093
01:29:28,477 --> 01:29:29,739
Go!

1094
01:29:31,480 --> 01:29:33,573
Daisy McConnahay.

1095
01:29:33,749 --> 01:29:35,683
You traitorous bitch.

1096
01:29:38,521 --> 01:29:40,512
Forward.

1097
01:29:42,958 --> 01:29:45,392
Well done, my lord.

1098
01:29:45,761 --> 01:29:47,626
That traitor.

1099
01:30:01,444 --> 01:30:02,775
Here's the news.

1100
01:30:02,945 --> 01:30:07,006
-The news of nearing victory comes.
-The French joined in our cause.

1101
01:30:07,183 --> 01:30:12,246
But the thoughts of Daisy cloud
the great happiness I would feel.

1102
01:30:12,521 --> 01:30:14,421
The noble Daisy.

1103
01:30:14,590 --> 01:30:18,458
Best in spirit, in kindness, in courage.

1104
01:30:19,829 --> 01:30:21,854
Be first in my thoughts.

1105
01:30:22,331 --> 01:30:25,596
Does she live? Is she hurt?

1106
01:30:25,768 --> 01:30:27,326
Killed?

1107
01:30:28,270 --> 01:30:30,397
I'd were it me in her stead.

1108
01:30:30,573 --> 01:30:33,701
I'd were it me with all my heart.

1109
01:30:33,876 --> 01:30:36,208
He says there's records
on everyone in here.

1110
01:30:36,378 --> 01:30:38,573
Those dead, those missing.

1111
01:30:39,682 --> 01:30:41,809
Did you ever think
we'd be doing this?

1112
01:30:41,984 --> 01:30:43,952
-No.
-Three days married.

1113
01:30:44,120 --> 01:30:45,553
I can't believe it.

1114
01:30:45,721 --> 01:30:49,487
-Give him the corner.
-I'll just go sign for this letter.

1115
01:30:51,894 --> 01:30:55,625
Pa, I'll wait over here for you,
all right?

1116
01:30:55,798 --> 01:30:58,892
We'll have to work on this
quite considerably, I think.

1117
01:30:59,068 --> 01:31:02,902
-I see. All right, thank you.
-No, no.

1118
01:31:03,072 --> 01:31:05,131
John Jeffries,
in the third artillery.

1119
01:31:05,307 --> 01:31:10,404
I'm looking for someone who was wounded
at Valley Forge, or killed, I don't know.

1120
01:31:11,247 --> 01:31:14,580
She was headed this way,
so I thought you might have a record of her.

1121
01:31:14,750 --> 01:31:18,743
-Name, Daisy McConnahay.
-Well, this is the book.

1122
01:31:18,921 --> 01:31:21,048
That mark there,
that means dead.

1123
01:31:21,223 --> 01:31:24,283
I don't read. I don't read.

1124
01:31:25,995 --> 01:31:29,726
-What was the name again?
-Daisy McConnahay.

1125
01:31:59,962 --> 01:32:01,623
Oh, hello.

1126
01:32:02,531 --> 01:32:03,623
What do you think?

1127
01:32:03,799 --> 01:32:05,767
-Of what?
-The British.

1128
01:32:05,935 --> 01:32:08,665
They made a terrible
mess of this place.

1129
01:32:09,138 --> 01:32:11,663
Congress can't meet
unless I set things aright.

1130
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:14,604
Congress?
I heard they fight a lot.

1131
01:32:18,047 --> 01:32:19,639
All we can do is pray.

1132
01:32:22,818 --> 01:32:25,150
I don't think that...

1133
01:32:27,823 --> 01:32:30,383
-Not listed there?
-No.

1134
01:32:33,963 --> 01:32:35,726
Mr. Rittenhouse made it.

1135
01:32:35,898 --> 01:32:38,560
This is the Earth
and that's the moon.

1136
01:32:38,734 --> 01:32:42,636
-How far is that?
-Two hundred thousand miles.

1137
01:32:42,871 --> 01:32:44,964
Don't seem that far.

1138
01:32:45,174 --> 01:32:48,473
-How do you know for sure?
-I went to Harvard.

1139
01:32:50,779 --> 01:32:54,715
See? See how the planets turn?

1140
01:32:55,217 --> 01:32:58,243
Each makes its own
revolution around the sun.

1141
01:32:58,420 --> 01:33:02,516
See, Mr. Jefferson says
that that's the idea of America.

1142
01:33:02,691 --> 01:33:04,591
A revolution.

1143
01:33:04,827 --> 01:33:06,692
A new turn.

1144
01:33:08,297 --> 01:33:11,130
-Anything?
-Ain't no record.

1145
01:33:13,369 --> 01:33:16,896
Long live Washington.

1146
01:33:17,072 --> 01:33:21,236
Long live Washington.

1147
01:33:21,410 --> 01:33:25,813
Long live Washington.

1148
01:33:32,888 --> 01:33:35,880
They say we're going north
to chase the British into the sea.

1149
01:33:36,058 --> 01:33:37,685
War will be over in two weeks.

1150
01:33:37,860 --> 01:33:40,886
About time.
I've had a belly full of this fight.

1151
01:33:41,063 --> 01:33:43,031
I haven't had a belly full in a month.

1152
01:33:43,198 --> 01:33:45,029
-Forward march.
-Bye.

1153
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:47,464
-Bye-bye.
-Number one company.

1154
01:33:47,636 --> 01:33:50,935
-Forward march.
-Goodbye. Goodbye, sweetheart.

1155
01:33:51,106 --> 01:33:52,539
Bye.

1156
01:33:52,708 --> 01:33:55,939
-I love you.
-I'll be waiting for you.

1157
01:33:56,111 --> 01:33:58,170
And so as everything
in this world...

1158
01:33:58,347 --> 01:34:01,839
...like the world itself
turns one full turn...

1159
01:34:02,017 --> 01:34:05,248
...here I be witnessing Ned
like once I was...

1160
01:34:05,421 --> 01:34:07,912
... taking a girl to wed,
make a wife.

1161
01:34:08,090 --> 01:34:10,820
-God bless you, Ned.
-Her name is Bella...

1162
01:34:10,993 --> 01:34:13,518
... who he sees and knows
at the mere sight...

1163
01:34:13,696 --> 01:34:15,789
-...she is the one.
-Go back to your guns.

1164
01:34:15,964 --> 01:34:21,334
As things in war are sudden,
so is the knowing of the heart.

1165
01:34:22,071 --> 01:34:23,834
-Thank you, sir.
-God bless you all.

1166
01:34:24,006 --> 01:34:27,032
-Do you want anything?
-I love you, Ned.

1167
01:34:27,476 --> 01:34:31,242
And with the help of heaven above,
he'll survive these last few days of war...

1168
01:34:31,413 --> 01:34:35,076
...to begin his family
in a land of freedom.

1169
01:34:35,250 --> 01:34:40,984
Start out on the fatherly life as once I did,
with its joys and its woes...

1170
01:34:41,156 --> 01:34:44,751
...its worries and its wonders.

1171
01:34:55,070 --> 01:35:00,235
A nearing victory and the last few days
of war they gave promise to...

1172
01:35:00,409 --> 01:35:03,378
...became threescore
months and more...

1173
01:35:03,545 --> 01:35:08,881
...till we marched into Yorktown
with guns still smoking and firing.

1174
01:35:09,618 --> 01:35:13,918
Oh, what teller of fortune or magic
seer would have said or held belief...

1175
01:35:14,089 --> 01:35:19,117
...that the beaten and straggling Continental
Army that we were a long five year ago...

1176
01:35:19,294 --> 01:35:24,596
...would today be at what our generals
do proclaim the very doorway of victory.

1177
01:35:24,767 --> 01:35:26,826
Get the British bastards out of here.

1178
01:35:29,438 --> 01:35:31,030
Fire.

1179
01:35:35,611 --> 01:35:36,805
Stretcher.

1180
01:35:41,583 --> 01:35:43,312
Fire.

1181
01:35:57,733 --> 01:35:59,428
Get up.

1182
01:36:08,210 --> 01:36:10,701
Two stretches to the right, Pa.

1183
01:36:11,079 --> 01:36:13,377
Two stretches to the right.

1184
01:36:14,216 --> 01:36:15,581
You seen him?

1185
01:36:16,652 --> 01:36:19,917
-Elevation, 150 yards.
-Got him.

1186
01:36:20,088 --> 01:36:22,488
-Where you gonna take him?
-Shoulder.

1187
01:36:22,891 --> 01:36:24,324
Hold on, boys.

1188
01:36:26,061 --> 01:36:28,052
That's a good shot.

1189
01:36:28,363 --> 01:36:30,490
I can't see for the smoke.

1190
01:36:52,054 --> 01:36:54,716
Quick, who's got more flint?

1191
01:36:56,124 --> 01:36:57,284
Pa.

1192
01:36:57,826 --> 01:36:59,191
Pa, it's him.

1193
01:36:59,361 --> 01:37:04,389
-Look down there at the post on the end.
-Kill those British bastards.

1194
01:37:06,001 --> 01:37:08,401
It's that English bastard.

1195
01:37:13,842 --> 01:37:17,005
-Oh, yeah.
-Hold steady, boys.

1196
01:37:17,179 --> 01:37:19,170
I see him, Ned.

1197
01:37:20,849 --> 01:37:22,248
I see him.

1198
01:37:28,023 --> 01:37:30,548
Hold steady, boys, steady.

1199
01:37:30,726 --> 01:37:32,489
What's he doing?

1200
01:37:40,903 --> 01:37:43,098
He's going to the beach.

1201
01:37:45,374 --> 01:37:47,001
He's coming for our spotter.

1202
01:37:53,782 --> 01:37:56,342
Advance range.

1203
01:37:58,954 --> 01:38:00,717
Make way.

1204
01:38:02,124 --> 01:38:03,489
Pull it.

1205
01:38:04,960 --> 01:38:07,520
Pull. Pull.

1206
01:38:13,235 --> 01:38:14,259
Third battery.

1207
01:38:14,436 --> 01:38:15,801
Keep your heads down.

1208
01:38:16,071 --> 01:38:17,060
Fire.

1209
01:38:17,239 --> 01:38:20,504
-Ned, Ned, are you all right?
-I'll be back soon.

1210
01:38:39,828 --> 01:38:41,693
Fire.

1211
01:41:17,719 --> 01:41:20,847
It's all clear, Pa.
They're all down.

1212
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:23,815
Lie down in green pastures.

1213
01:41:23,992 --> 01:41:25,550
Don't leave me, son.

1214
01:41:25,727 --> 01:41:28,127
-He leadeth me beside the still waters...
-I'm dead.

1215
01:41:28,296 --> 01:41:29,456
...and restoreth my soul.

1216
01:41:29,631 --> 01:41:32,065
You're not, son. Don't leave me.

1217
01:41:32,234 --> 01:41:35,226
You've got drummers' luck.
Don't leave me.

1218
01:41:35,403 --> 01:41:38,133
Be brave, son. Be brave.

1219
01:41:38,540 --> 01:41:40,337
He leadeth me beside the still waters.

1220
01:41:40,509 --> 01:41:43,000
He restoreth my soul. He leads
me in the paths of righteousness.

1221
01:41:44,379 --> 01:41:45,846
For his namesake.

1222
01:41:46,014 --> 01:41:49,245
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death...

1223
01:41:49,417 --> 01:41:52,079
...I will fear no evil,
for thou art with me.

1224
01:41:52,254 --> 01:41:55,781
Thy rod and thy staff,
they comfort me.

1225
01:41:56,224 --> 01:41:57,714
I've got him dead, Pa.

1226
01:41:59,427 --> 01:42:01,190
You do, Ned.

1227
01:42:09,404 --> 01:42:13,204
Don't leave me, son.
Don't leave me.

1228
01:42:21,216 --> 01:42:22,706
No.

1229
01:42:25,153 --> 01:42:27,053
I ain't gonna do it.

1230
01:42:31,493 --> 01:42:33,120
It gave me great
comfort to know...

1231
01:42:33,295 --> 01:42:37,891
...that he could not kill an unarmed
and praying enemy face to face.

1232
01:42:38,700 --> 01:42:42,568
For going from boy to man
in this long ride of hate and killing...

1233
01:42:42,737 --> 01:42:47,071
...has made many a fighter
savage and unheeding of that.

1234
01:42:47,242 --> 01:42:50,973
We, the right or the wrong,
are all flesh and blood...

1235
01:42:51,146 --> 01:42:53,740
... with minds and souls...

1236
01:42:53,915 --> 01:42:56,440
...hopes and dreams.

1237
01:43:01,089 --> 01:43:03,023
We best go home.

1238
01:43:13,869 --> 01:43:15,268
Come on.

1239
01:43:15,537 --> 01:43:16,936
Come on.

1240
01:43:19,341 --> 01:43:21,901
Come on, lad.
Come along, son.

1241
01:43:22,077 --> 01:43:25,171
Come on.
Up, up, come on.

1242
01:45:50,025 --> 01:45:51,754
And two flags.

1243
01:45:51,926 --> 01:45:55,054
One of surrender,
the other of stripes and stars...

1244
01:45:55,230 --> 01:45:59,360
...claiming a fresh-born,
independent country.

1245
01:46:00,068 --> 01:46:03,629
It gives rise to my heart to see it.

1246
01:46:03,805 --> 01:46:05,932
What a struggle has ended.

1247
01:46:06,107 --> 01:46:09,372
The cruelty, sadness of it, finished.

1248
01:46:09,544 --> 01:46:12,536
And strange though to say...

1249
01:46:12,714 --> 01:46:16,810
...seems the grass underfoot
as I walk feels different.

1250
01:46:17,952 --> 01:46:20,113
I look to the sky...

1251
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:25,316
...and see the smoke of war
drifting away on the wind.

1252
01:46:26,261 --> 01:46:31,790
And all who suffered stand now
on the beginning of a new horizon.

1253
01:46:32,700 --> 01:46:34,463
I with them.

1254
01:46:57,325 --> 01:46:59,987
Two for you.
Twenty dollars? That's it?

1255
01:47:00,161 --> 01:47:02,391
Right. Next.

1256
01:47:07,102 --> 01:47:10,538
Come on, come on.
Don't be all day, mister.

1257
01:47:21,983 --> 01:47:24,975
" Boats and providence, 1776."

1258
01:47:25,153 --> 01:47:27,348
Well, you've had this a long time,
haven't you?

1259
01:47:27,522 --> 01:47:31,652
All right, 10, 20, 30, 40.

1260
01:47:31,826 --> 01:47:33,623
That's it. Come on, next.

1261
01:47:33,795 --> 01:47:35,956
What do you mean?
Wait, wait, where's the rest?

1262
01:47:36,131 --> 01:47:37,792
-What rest, mister?
-Seventy dollars.

1263
01:47:37,966 --> 01:47:41,197
They've been devalued. That's all
them old continentals is worth now.

1264
01:47:41,369 --> 01:47:44,566
Will you take it or leave it?
Move, you're holding up the queue.

1265
01:47:44,739 --> 01:47:47,207
-Don't be pushing me.
-I'm not pushing. I'm very busy.

1266
01:47:47,375 --> 01:47:50,208
-What happened to the 150 acres?
-What you complaining about?

1267
01:47:50,378 --> 01:47:52,573
I'm not complaining.
I'm asking a question.

1268
01:47:52,747 --> 01:47:54,840
What happened to the 150 acres
I was promised?

1269
01:47:55,016 --> 01:47:57,712
You got two arms and two legs
and two eyes, haven't you?

1270
01:47:57,886 --> 01:47:59,410
Now, move on,
I'm very busy.

1271
01:47:59,587 --> 01:48:01,680
-Right.
-I told you to keep your hands off me.

1272
01:48:01,856 --> 01:48:03,756
-You're holding the line.
-I'm asking you.

1273
01:48:03,925 --> 01:48:05,825
-You're holding the line.
-I'm asking you.

1274
01:48:05,994 --> 01:48:09,623
What happened to the hundred
and fifty acres of land I was promised?

1275
01:48:10,131 --> 01:48:15,364
It was sold by Congress to speculators
to pay for the war debt, all right?

1276
01:48:15,537 --> 01:48:17,801
-Now, move it. Are you?
-I'm the bloody war debt.

1277
01:48:17,972 --> 01:48:21,567
This chit here, that's a bloody war debt.
We're all the bloody war debt.

1278
01:48:21,743 --> 01:48:23,574
-So why don't you go to Congress?
-Yeah.

1279
01:48:23,745 --> 01:48:26,373
Don't tell me.
You go to Congress and you tell them.

1280
01:48:26,548 --> 01:48:29,039
-I'll tell you, because you're standing here.
-Next.

1281
01:48:29,217 --> 01:48:31,276
I'm not interested in talking to you.
Next.

1282
01:48:31,452 --> 01:48:33,545
Where's this Congress
you're talking about?

1283
01:48:34,422 --> 01:48:37,152
-Congress is coming.
You go and tell them. -Where?

1284
01:48:37,325 --> 01:48:39,418
-Where are they coming?
-They're on their way.

1285
01:48:39,594 --> 01:48:41,562
-When?
-They're coming, damn you.

1286
01:48:41,729 --> 01:48:43,856
-I told you they're coming.
-Damn you.

1287
01:48:44,032 --> 01:48:45,056
Go on, get out.

1288
01:48:45,233 --> 01:48:48,134
All these men here,
we all fought for something, and we got it.

1289
01:48:48,303 --> 01:48:49,463
You think I didn't fight?

1290
01:48:49,637 --> 01:48:51,696
You take it from us,
we're gonna fight again.

1291
01:48:51,873 --> 01:48:55,172
I'm taking nothing from you.
You open your mouth to Congress.

1292
01:49:14,762 --> 01:49:17,856
-Did you get the money?
-Forty dollars, that's it.

1293
01:49:18,032 --> 01:49:20,660
-That's all?
-That's all they're worth.

1294
01:49:21,002 --> 01:49:25,166
-And the hundred and fifty acres?
-It's gone to the speculators.

1295
01:49:25,340 --> 01:49:27,035
All of it?

1296
01:49:28,543 --> 01:49:29,874
Where's that leave us?

1297
01:49:32,981 --> 01:49:36,439
You take the Hudson
to the Mohawk trail.

1298
01:49:36,618 --> 01:49:38,745
Then up as far as she goes.

1299
01:49:38,920 --> 01:49:42,253
Tonti says there's farmland
out west for the taking.

1300
01:49:46,761 --> 01:49:48,661
You go settle like your dream, son.

1301
01:49:50,632 --> 01:49:52,327
So, what, you ain't coming?

1302
01:49:53,368 --> 01:49:57,327
I can't, Ned.
I should stay here.

1303
01:49:58,506 --> 01:50:00,440
It's good for me here.

1304
01:50:01,142 --> 01:50:03,076
Things for me.

1305
01:50:05,480 --> 01:50:07,539
I can learn to read.

1306
01:50:13,521 --> 01:50:16,718
This is what I want, Ned.
It's what I want.

1307
01:50:22,697 --> 01:50:24,528
I'm gonna miss you, Pa.

1308
01:50:25,767 --> 01:50:27,701
I'm gonna miss you bad.

1309
01:50:46,054 --> 01:50:47,919
Here, take this.

1310
01:50:48,156 --> 01:50:50,021
-I don't need it all.
-Oh, you do.

1311
01:50:50,191 --> 01:50:52,989
Bella's gonna need
more than one skinny cow.

1312
01:50:59,967 --> 01:51:01,696
Take care.

1313
01:51:04,505 --> 01:51:06,496
God be with you.

1314
01:51:07,975 --> 01:51:11,001
-Don't forget no good tunes.
-I won't, Tom.

1315
01:51:12,246 --> 01:51:14,111
Goodbye, Tom.

1316
01:51:17,819 --> 01:51:19,343
Whoa.

1317
01:51:24,025 --> 01:51:26,152
You name your kids for your old friends,
Ned.

1318
01:51:26,327 --> 01:51:27,419
I'll make you proud, Pa.

1319
01:51:28,663 --> 01:51:31,291
-You tell them about me.
-I will.

1320
01:51:31,466 --> 01:51:33,263
How we fought.

1321
01:51:33,434 --> 01:51:34,492
I will, Pa.

1322
01:51:35,503 --> 01:51:37,698
Tell them how far we come.

1323
01:51:53,855 --> 01:51:58,315
My lost family comes back to
me in all these I see before me.

1324
01:51:59,060 --> 01:52:05,898
I feel Kaitlyn in the young ones on high
released from all they suffered here.

1325
01:52:06,167 --> 01:52:08,226
I see also in these shining faces...

1326
01:52:08,403 --> 01:52:12,464
...the bright-eyed, tender and
gentle face of Daisy McConnahay.

1327
01:52:12,640 --> 01:52:15,803
Many from different lands,
be they exiled or fled...

1328
01:52:15,977 --> 01:52:19,572
...from want of respect and free thought,
now share a home...

1329
01:52:19,747 --> 01:52:24,741
... where as one or all,
they will have a voice that can be heard.

1330
01:52:25,253 --> 01:52:29,053
No more to be divided
into the lowly and privileged.

1331
01:52:29,223 --> 01:52:32,590
But equal in chance and opportunity.

1332
01:52:33,428 --> 01:52:39,697
And all the children of all the children
to come will know of this word: revolution.

1333
01:52:39,934 --> 01:52:41,595
And what it meant...

1334
01:52:41,769 --> 01:52:45,398
...and never let down
their will to protect it.
