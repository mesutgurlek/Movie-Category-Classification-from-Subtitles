00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:29,393
<i>"Now, in Injia's sunny clime,</i>
<i>Where I used to spend my time</i>

2
00:00:29,462 --> 00:00:31,930
<i>"A-servin' of 'Er Majesty, the Queen</i>

3

<i>"Was our regimental</i> bhisti <i>"</i>

6
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:16,121
Detail, halt!

7
00:03:27,006 --> 00:03:28,132
What was that all about?

8
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,472
They are pilgrims, <i>sahib,</i>
going home to the hills.

9
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,943
They beg to follow us for safety.

10
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:37,849
Tell them not to fall too far behind.

11
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,256
Detail, walk. March!

12
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,455
Jadoo, the sun is going down.

13
00:03:53,766 --> 00:03:56,234
Expect we'd better bivouac
at Elephant Rock, as usual.

14
00:03:56,302 --> 00:03:58,031
Yes, Markham <i>sahib.</i>

15
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,642
I don't like it, Mitchell.

16
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:49,050
I don't like it. Silence is unhealthy.

17
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:51,588
No word from Markham in 48 hours.

18
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:55,760
Blast it, an officer and his patrol
don't vanish into thin air.

19
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,859
- Telegraph just got through, sir.
- Good.

20
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,789
What have you got?

21
00:05:26,859 --> 00:05:29,521
Wires apparently down
for the last two days.

22
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,859
I thought it was something like that.

23
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:51,981
Emergency signal, sir.

24
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,021
Why doesn't he go on?

25
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,230
Wire's gone dead, sir.

26
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:08,927
I don't like this.

27
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:39,195
Can't have the wires down.
Things start too quickly up there.

28
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,228
Higginbotham.

29
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:48,935
Find Sgts. MacChesney, Cutter,
and Ballantine, and bring them here.

30
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,272
That's a bit difficult,
as they're all on leave.

31
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,244
On some mysterious mission, they said.

32
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:55,644
It'll be a mystery
if they come back right side up.

33
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,683
Bring them here at once.

34
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,993
- What do you want?
- Where's Sgt. Ballantine?

35
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,102
- Here.
- Where's Sgt. Cutter?

36
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:24,207
He's busy.

37
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:35,885
Buying a map for a buried treasure.
You ought to have your head examined.

38
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,755
- I didn't know the map was a swindle.
- You and your emeralds.

39
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:42,787
You ought to be put in a padded cell.

40
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,126
If we'd found them emeralds,
we could've left the army...

41
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:49,259
and lived like dukes. See?

42
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:01,178
That's the fellow that sold me the map.

43
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:04,683
Just a minute.
Let me take care of him, will you?

44
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,552
Take your hands off that man.

45
00:08:24,737 --> 00:08:28,537
I'm waiting for an explanation.
Speak up, MacChesney.

46
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,072
Speak up!

47
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,646
We were swindled, sir.

48
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:44,081
- We?
- Who swindled you?

49
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:49,889
We don't want to make any charges
until we have further proof.

50
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:52,692
Further proof?
You practically wrecked a village.

51
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:55,325
You surely didn't do that,
MacChesney, without proof?

52
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:57,494
Sir, we had our suspicions.

53
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,633
Suspicions of what?

54
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:03,342
Come on. I've no time
to wheedle the story out of you.

55
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:08,206
We bought a map.

56
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:10,842
Go on.

57
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:15,317
From a private
in a certain Scottish regiment, sir.

58
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:19,789
No, I did it. I bought the map myself, sir.

59
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:25,954
Now, listen. Don't you
try to shield your friends, Cutter.

60
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,627
And it won't do you two any good
to hide behind Cutter's generosity.

61
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,729
Out with it. A map of what?

62
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,501
Of Lake Singali, sir.

63
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:40,941
Yes, sir. And the privilege of diving into it
to our heart's content.

64
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,672
Diving for what?

65
00:09:46,218 --> 00:09:49,153
- For emeralds, sir.
- A barge full, sir.

66
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:53,351
According to the information I bought,
it was sunk in the year 241.

67
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:57,989
I can hardly believe it.
Ballantine, a man of your intelligence...

68
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,589
MacChesney, at your age...

69
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,998
They was the spoils of a maharajah, sir.

70
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:07,938
Thank you, Cutter. That will be sufficient.

71
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:10,574
As for you two...

72
00:10:10,643 --> 00:10:13,771
I ought to take away your stripes,
not only for insubordination...

73
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:17,782
but for idiocy.
Sheer, childish, soft-brained idiocy.

74
00:10:20,186 --> 00:10:24,680
But fortunately for you,
I need all three of you at Tantrapur.

75
00:10:24,757 --> 00:10:26,054
We're going out on a job, sir?

76
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,719
Of the most vital importance.
You leave for Tantrapur...

77
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,352
with a detachment in the morning...

78
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:32,659
to repair the telegraph and keep it open.

79
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:36,498
Left turn! Left wheel, quick march!

80
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,832
Left wheel! Attention!

81
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,979
Eyes forward!

82
00:12:48,734 --> 00:12:50,167
Party, halt!

83
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,400
Sergeants, dismount!

84
00:13:32,144 --> 00:13:33,270
Cold.

85
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,244
Stale.

86
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:56,859
I don't mind saying the whole thing
fair gives me the creeps.

87
00:13:56,936 --> 00:13:59,996
Creeps or no creeps,
we've got to get in touch with the Colonel.

88
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:03,200
We can't until we get them poles up
and this wire strung.

89
00:14:03,275 --> 00:14:06,540
<i>Naik,</i> detail 10 men for guard duty.

90
00:14:06,745 --> 00:14:09,578
The remainder will pile arms
and prepare for work.

91
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:14,644
Halt!

92
00:14:33,439 --> 00:14:36,237
Gunga Din, water.

93
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,538
Gunga Din, bring water!

94
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,777
Bring water!

95
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:59,293
Whoever's been playing tricks
with this village is blinking clever.

96
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:03,301
I couldn't find a trail
or a single footprint leading in or out.

97
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:36,851
So the village isn't quite deserted, eh?

98
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:41,064
<i>- Salaam, sahib.</i>
- Who are you? What are you doing?

99
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:45,202
My name is Pandu Lal.
I'm a miserable seller of trinkets.

100
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:50,801
Last night a band of dacoits
raided this village, looted my shop...

101
00:16:51,477 --> 00:16:54,344
and stole off with my poor wife
and six children.

102
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,275
The children are looking bonny.

103
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:32,245
Come on, everybody, in the other room.

104
00:17:32,317 --> 00:17:36,811
Go on, get up. On the double.
Get in there. You heard me!

105
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:43,183
Quick! That's right. Go on.

106
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,121
That's better.

107
00:17:53,872 --> 00:17:57,399
- What's that?
- Trinkets, <i>sahib.</i>

108
00:17:58,110 --> 00:18:00,510
Only what I could save
from my pitiful stock.

109
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,140
- Worth hardly a few annas.
- Go on, open them up.

110
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:02,000
Who are these playful subjects here?

111
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:04,304
I don't know, but young Toad Face there
seems to be leader.

112
00:19:05,844 --> 00:19:07,471
Get them all out of here.

113
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:11,038
Come on, get out of here. On your feet.

114
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:16,445
Hold them there.

115
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:20,822
<i>Naik,</i> detail eight men for escort duty.
Bring them here on the double.

116
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,988
Listen, you.
What became of Burgess <i>sahib?</i>

117
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:28,929
- Come on, spit it out.
- He can speak, but he won't.

118
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,666
- He doesn't know.
- Here.

119
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,474
You never saw one of these things before,
did you?

120
00:19:39,545 --> 00:19:41,945
It's for growing daisies, isn't it?

121
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,541
- Or for planting lilies for people's graves.
- No, <i>sahib.</i>

122
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:51,321
What became of these people here?

123
00:19:56,562 --> 00:19:58,894
- He doesn't know.
- That's good.

124
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:03,601
We'll take them back with us and let
the Colonel put them through the mangle.

125
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,735
No. Will not go with the white <i>sahib.</i>

126
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:23,152
You will never leave here.
Already your graves are dug.

127
00:20:23,422 --> 00:20:26,050
By nightfall, Ma Kali will be smiling.

128
00:20:42,808 --> 00:20:46,107
Never mind the second chorus. Come on.

129
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:00,754
Party, form a square!

130
00:22:07,726 --> 00:22:11,719
Under cover, everybody! Get in there!
Take cover in the courtyard.

131
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:18,027
Close the gates.

132
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:23,164
Climb the wall, everybody!

133
00:22:24,643 --> 00:22:26,702
Come on, men, on the roof!

134
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:50,724
Look out, Mac!

135
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:58,209
Take cover behind the wall.
Volley firing. Ready?

136
00:23:02,481 --> 00:23:03,948
Ready? Get set. Fire!

137
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:19,393
Here you are, Cutter.

138
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,697
Get in there. Come on.

139
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:37,978
Ballantine, come up!

140
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,561
Let's go.

141
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:10,237
Here's a present for you.

142
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:23,852
Bal, catch!

143
00:24:25,197 --> 00:24:27,358
Come on, let's go!

144
00:24:29,801 --> 00:24:30,995
Charge!

145
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:18,581
Everybody under cover!

146
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:53,677
Get behind the wall. Come on. Hurry up.

147
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,787
<i>- Panee,</i> Sergeant <i>sahib?</i>
- No!

148
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:05,626
How did you get here?
You're a funny bloke, Din...

149
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,192
but I'll admit you're a good <i>bhisti.</i>

150
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,833
- Could be first-class soldier, <i>sahib.</i>
- Don't make me laugh.

151
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,618
Get to the river!

152
00:26:46,871 --> 00:26:50,773
- Come on, you savage, over you go.
- Over you go.

153
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,537
All right, give me that.

154
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,935
What's the matter, Bal?

155
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:29,742
You've been woolgathering
ever since we crawled out of the river.

156
00:27:31,349 --> 00:27:34,841
- You know, my time is up on May 14.
- What of that?

157
00:27:35,186 --> 00:27:38,178
You can sign on
for another nine years, can't you?

158
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,121
Make a man out of him.

159
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:43,917
I'm leaving the service.

160
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,486
- Leaving the service?
- That's right.

161
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:50,658
I'm getting married,
and I'm going in the tea business.

162
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,225
- Married!
- Tea business!

163
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,168
Why, you're mad if...

164
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:59,267
March to attention, everybody!
Let's march in in good style, men.

165
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:04,113
- Fall in up there.
- Left, right, left.

166
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:39,049
Tell the Sergeant
to report at the office immediately.

167
00:28:39,117 --> 00:28:40,379
Yes, sir.

168
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,085
Party, right wheel!

169
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:53,494
Halt! Left face!

170
00:28:57,001 --> 00:28:58,901
Sergeants to the front!

171
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:04,302
The wiring party's
returned from Tantrapur, sir.

172
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:07,606
Eight killed, three wounded.
Otherwise all correct.

173
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,442
Very well, Sergeant. Dismiss your men...

174
00:29:09,514 --> 00:29:11,141
and report at the office immediately.

175
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:12,740
Very good, sir.

176
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:16,347
Party, dismissed!

177
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,437
- Identical, Mitchell.
- Good heavens, a Thug pickaxe.

178
00:29:46,351 --> 00:29:49,752
It's incredible,
but that's what happened to Markham.

179
00:29:49,821 --> 00:29:52,415
I'm afraid they've done away
with poor Burgess, too.

180
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:54,924
There's been none of this for 50 years.

181
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,962
Thuggee. That's what it is, Mitchell.

182
00:29:58,029 --> 00:29:59,326
What's Thuggee, sir?

183
00:29:59,397 --> 00:30:02,798
A murder cult Col. Sleeman crushed
50 years ago.

184
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:06,598
The Thugs were the most fiendish
band of killers that ever existed.

185
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:11,301
There were at least 10,000 in India,
and they murdered 30,000 people a year.

186
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,967
Thuggee was practiced
from the Himalayas to Ceylon.

187
00:30:14,045 --> 00:30:17,503
The order was religious and worshipped
Kali, the goddess of blood.

188
00:30:17,749 --> 00:30:20,684
The Thugs were stranglers,
weren't they, sir?

189
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:24,153
Stranglers. They dug the graves
of their victims in advance.

190
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:27,157
Mitchell, we must stamp this out
immediately.

191
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,221
The Lancers will scour the country
west of Tantrapur...

192
00:30:30,295 --> 00:30:32,525
- you will search the regions to the east.
- Right.

193
00:30:32,597 --> 00:30:35,896
- What do we do, sir?
- You're dismissed, Ballantine.

194
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:40,362
MacChesney, you and Cutter
will leave tomorrow with a stronger...

195
00:30:40,438 --> 00:30:42,303
Ballantine, you're dismissed.

196
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:48,942
You and Cutter will take
a stronger detachment tomorrow...

197
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,605
into Tantrapur, to finish your work.

198
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:54,641
Maj. Mitchell and I will be in close touch
with you at all times on either flank.

199
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:56,710
Keep your eyes open for Thugs.

200
00:31:02,727 --> 00:31:06,185
Ballantine would be a great help, sir.
If I may remind you...

201
00:31:06,264 --> 00:31:09,995
the three of us have always
brought off things very well together.

202
00:31:10,068 --> 00:31:12,298
Yes, sir. He's indispensable.

203
00:31:12,837 --> 00:31:16,967
Ballantine's leaving the service in six days.
He's getting married.

204
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:24,213
Couldn't you put your foot down?
Forbid the banns? Something like that?

205
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:28,010
When the parson says, "Speak now
or forever hold your peace"...

206
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:30,748
couldn't you give him a roar, sir?
You know what I mean?

207
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:33,052
Higginbotham will replace him.

208
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:36,857
Dismissed.

209
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,000
- Tommy, I've got you back again.
- And I've got you.

210
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:46,263
I'm here to stay, forever and ever.

211
00:31:46,337 --> 00:31:47,668
Forever and ever.

212
00:31:53,077 --> 00:31:54,704
That's horrible.

213
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:59,644
- She's charmed him like a snake.
- The siren.

214
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:07,115
Wouldn't believe it if I didn't see it
with my own eyes.

215
00:32:07,191 --> 00:32:08,624
Me, neither.

216
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,330
I can't stand it.

217
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,270
Me, too.

218
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:30,542
Left! Right! Center!

219
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:41,223
As you were!

220
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,388
Company, attention!

221
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:22,431
Right turn!

222
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,427
Two paces forward. March!

223
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,041
Head up, chin in.

224
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,815
Get those thumbs
behind the seams of your trousers...

225
00:33:42,887 --> 00:33:44,980
Get them back.

226
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:51,086
Lower that left shoulder
an eighth of an inch. That's much better.

227
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:57,826
Otherwise you're looking
very regimental, Din.

228
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:01,497
Thank you, Sergeant.

229
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:05,200
- Was salute satisfactory?
- That's the idea...

230
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:09,778
only you want these fingers
to fan the eyebrows, more like this.

231
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:13,445
The breeze from them fingers
ought to almost blow this eyebrow off.

232
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,145
Now try it again.

233
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:19,416
Very good, indeed.

234
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:22,220
That one almost blew your turban off,
didn't it?

235
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,760
Very regimental, Din.

236
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:30,326
Keep them at it, <i>Subedar sahib.</i>
They may need it.

237
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:37,065
Tell the <i>Subedar</i> to drill the men
till sundown.

238
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:50,416
- Where did you get the bugle, Din?
- Please, <i>sahib,</i> I find when nobody looking.

239
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:53,747
Don't you know that's very naughty?

240
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:59,388
Please, <i>sahib,</i> don't take away.
Bugle only pleasure for poor <i>bhisti.</i>

241
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,969
Thank you, <i>sahib.</i>

242
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:17,176
<i>- Sahib</i> care to hear new call?
- Not now.

243
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,118
Very regimental, Din.

244
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,726
Company, attention! Company, dismissed!

245
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,534
Let me see your tongue, Annie.

246
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:15,431
I'd like to try it, Sergeant <i>sahib.</i>

247
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,367
Very old Indian remedy.

248
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:30,409
All right, go ahead. But be careful.

249
00:36:30,721 --> 00:36:33,246
If anything happens to her, I'II...

250
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:37,185
Understand? Cry my eyes out.

251
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:44,758
No, <i>sahib!</i>
Very little bit goes very long way.

252
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,535
Gulp it down quick.

253
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,371
Then you won't taste it.

254
00:36:59,483 --> 00:37:03,146
I know. You want your daddy
to give it to you, don't you?

255
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:07,221
Daddy will give you the medicine.
Give it to me.

256
00:37:08,693 --> 00:37:10,923
There. Be a nice girl, now.

257
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:14,524
Or you'll never be strong and big
like Daddy.

258
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:19,195
If Daddy took a spoonful first himself,
Baby might do a patty-cake for him.

259
00:37:23,608 --> 00:37:25,303
This is delicious.

260
00:37:30,014 --> 00:37:31,777
This is...

261
00:37:32,216 --> 00:37:36,312
All for a nice little elephant girl.
This is lovely.

262
00:37:50,701 --> 00:37:53,067
You ain't so stupid as you look.

263
00:38:13,324 --> 00:38:14,848
That's better.

264
00:38:15,593 --> 00:38:18,528
Annie, don't ever worry me like that again.

265
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:22,895
There you are, you two.
I've got letters for both of you.

266
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:27,131
There. Sgt. MacChesney
and Sgt. Archibald Cutter.

267
00:38:31,942 --> 00:38:33,842
Look what it says here.

268
00:38:34,545 --> 00:38:37,105
"Miss Emaline Stebbins
requests the pleasure...

269
00:38:37,181 --> 00:38:39,911
"of Sgt. Archibald Cutter's company
at a"...

270
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:41,349
What's that?

271
00:38:41,419 --> 00:38:45,446
"...betrothal dance preceding her marriage
to Sgt. Thomas Ballantine.

272
00:38:45,790 --> 00:38:48,918
"8:00 p.m. Friday." That's tonight.

273
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:25,257
I worried so about you, dear,
while you were away.

274
00:39:25,563 --> 00:39:29,021
Perfectly awful things
must have happened at Tantrapur.

275
00:39:31,235 --> 00:39:33,601
It was rather touch and go there for a bit.

276
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:38,074
- You haven't told me yet about it yourself.
- No, I haven't, have I?

277
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:44,038
I had to give my undivided attention
to the repairing of the wires.

278
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:47,016
Cutter and MacChesney
should have watched out for the enemy...

279
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,451
but they were off chasing butterflies
or something like that.

280
00:39:50,688 --> 00:39:54,124
I finally got the detachment to the river,
and we dived in and escaped.

281
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:56,284
Tommy, you're so marvelous.

282
00:40:01,499 --> 00:40:03,729
That's all there is to it, I suppose.

283
00:40:04,802 --> 00:40:07,930
On the last roof
we almost lost MacChesney.

284
00:40:08,639 --> 00:40:11,767
His great elephant hoof
crashed through and stuck.

285
00:40:12,042 --> 00:40:16,001
- How did you get him out?
- We had to saw his leg off at the hip.

286
00:40:17,681 --> 00:40:21,048
If you don't believe me,
just look behind that shrub.

287
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:22,404
Save some for the elephant.

288
00:41:34,358 --> 00:41:36,155
Destroy the evidence.

289
00:41:36,727 --> 00:41:39,525
- Stand guard, will you?
- Yeah.

290
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:59,075
Never mind that, Sergeant. Stand easy.

291
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:09,351
- Good evening, Colonel.
- Evening, Stebbins.

292
00:42:09,426 --> 00:42:11,894
- Good evening, Major.
- How are you?

293
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:13,628
No formality.

294
00:42:13,697 --> 00:42:16,291
We just dropped in
to wish little Emmy the best of luck.

295
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,734
That's very nice of you, sir.
I'll bring Emmy to you.

296
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:28,001
- Looks like a jolly party, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir. Very jolly, sir.

297
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:33,846
Is that a punch bowl you're shutting out?

298
00:42:34,785 --> 00:42:36,275
Is that punch?

299
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:45,554
Some peoples calls it a punch, sir,
but I calls it swill.

300
00:42:46,797 --> 00:42:49,823
Nonsense. Stebbins is famous
for his punch. Have a spot?

301
00:42:49,900 --> 00:42:51,094
Rather.

302
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:59,765
Excuse me, sir.
I wouldn't touch it if I were you, sir.

303
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:04,145
Too watery, sir. Besides,
it'll rust in the lining of your stomach.

304
00:43:04,214 --> 00:43:07,274
- We'll be the judge of that.
- Wait, sir. There's a fly.

305
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,546
- I don't see a fly.
- Neither do I.

306
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:12,713
There it is, sir. It just dove under the ice.

307
00:43:13,390 --> 00:43:16,325
I'll get the little nipper in half a jiffy.

308
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:27,535
I got him.

309
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:39,907
Hear him? Humming like a beehive.

310
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:49,523
He's gone.

311
00:43:51,962 --> 00:43:55,830
Ain't that a shame? There he goes.

312
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:10,979
Come along, Mitchell.
I think we'll forget the punch.

313
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:19,084
Tommy, you know we have
Sgt. Higginbotham to thank...

314
00:44:19,156 --> 00:44:21,056
for your being let out of the expedition.

315
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,114
That's right.

316
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:24,717
The Colonel says I'm the only man
sharp enough...

317
00:44:24,795 --> 00:44:27,992
- to replace Sgt. Ballantine.
- That's very flattering.

318
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:33,229
I'm only glad to be so some help in,
shall we say, Cupid's service.

319
00:44:33,303 --> 00:44:34,361
One thing I can promise...

320
00:44:34,438 --> 00:44:37,430
with Cutter and MacChesney about,
you won't have one dull moment.

321
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,671
I've got a feeling they don't like me
very much. It's just as well.

322
00:44:40,744 --> 00:44:44,373
- The army's no place for sentiment, I says.
- That's right.

323
00:44:47,418 --> 00:44:50,353
Excuse me.
I've got a pebble in my left boot.

324
00:44:51,822 --> 00:44:53,619
Hello, Higginbotham.

325
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:57,954
- How would you like to come with me?
- What?

326
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:01,623
I'd like to discuss
a few of my military theories with you.

327
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:05,567
I'd like to have a little chat,
get to know each other better.

328
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:09,304
- How about a bit of a drink, Bert?
- Thanks, Cutter.

329
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:13,769
- Where's Ballantine?
- Never mind that civilian.

330
00:45:13,844 --> 00:45:16,677
I got Bertie Higginbotham,
his replacement.

331
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:25,652
Bertie's got a thirst like a derby winner,
haven't you, Bertie?

332
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:29,887
We can look after that, old boy.
Take a plunge into this punch.

333
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:33,619
Punch? That stuff's for drummer boys
and old ladies.

334
00:45:33,697 --> 00:45:37,133
- Not that stuff.
- That would knock a horse down.

335
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,260
Swill that down, me boy...

336
00:45:39,336 --> 00:45:43,466
and you'll think all the Thugs in India
is a bunch of missionaries.

337
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:46,671
That's right, Bert.

338
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:56,308
That's a funny thing.
The punch tastes all right.

339
00:46:00,624 --> 00:46:02,182
It's all right.

340
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,292
Bert, how about having another drink?

341
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:12,665
To the new comradeship, Mac and you
and me and the regiment forever.

342
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:16,168
- That's it, Bertie, my boy.
- I'll drink to that.

343
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:17,867
All right.

344
00:46:20,410 --> 00:46:23,072
Here's to good old Bertie Higginbotham...

345
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:26,674
the finest soldier since
William the blooming Conqueror.

346
00:46:33,557 --> 00:46:35,889
Down the hatch, boys!

347
00:47:23,256 --> 00:47:24,883
Which of these two do you prefer?

348
00:47:24,957 --> 00:47:27,721
I don't know. Try them both.
One for each window.

349
00:47:27,793 --> 00:47:31,524
Don't be silly, darling.
It's as much your problem as it is mine.

350
00:47:31,597 --> 00:47:34,361
- I know.
- These curtains are for your den.

351
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,129
My den?

352
00:47:57,957 --> 00:48:00,050
What's this, Sergeant?
Buying a trousseau?

353
00:48:00,126 --> 00:48:01,218
We're buying curtains.

354
00:48:01,294 --> 00:48:05,731
I thought it was for underpants,
the kind civilians wear in the tea business.

355
00:48:06,198 --> 00:48:08,325
Will you two leave
and stop annoying Tommy?

356
00:48:08,401 --> 00:48:11,996
I'd like to oblige, but we're marching off
to Tantrapur in 20 minutes...

357
00:48:12,071 --> 00:48:13,868
and Tommy's marching with us.

358
00:48:13,939 --> 00:48:16,464
But Higginbotham's replacing him.
The Colonel said...

359
00:48:16,542 --> 00:48:18,134
Higginbotham's in hospital, Miss.

360
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:21,839
I grieve to say, Miss,
that the man is a tower of pain.

361
00:48:21,914 --> 00:48:24,542
- Something he must have ate.
- Or drank?

362
00:48:25,051 --> 00:48:27,485
Sgt. Ballantine, fall in!

363
00:48:29,188 --> 00:48:31,782
- Tommy.
- It's the Colonel's orders, Miss.

364
00:48:31,857 --> 00:48:35,759
Tommy, these friends of yours
have engineered this behind your back.

365
00:48:35,828 --> 00:48:37,591
Don't cry, darling.

366
00:48:40,499 --> 00:48:42,467
Goodbye.

367
00:48:44,704 --> 00:48:46,365
This is May 9.

368
00:48:46,439 --> 00:48:49,875
I'm going with you for five days,
and good company I'll be...

369
00:48:49,942 --> 00:48:52,740
but at sunset on May 14,
when my time is up...

370
00:48:52,812 --> 00:48:56,339
wherever we are, I'm going to knock
you two apes' heads together.

371
00:48:56,415 --> 00:48:57,848
Now come on.

372
00:48:58,317 --> 00:49:00,410
- Pardon me, madam.
- Fall in!

373
00:49:10,496 --> 00:49:12,521
Your petticoat's showing.

374
00:49:51,237 --> 00:49:55,731
<i>Ek</i> Number! All's well!

375
00:50:07,987 --> 00:50:10,820
<i>Do</i> Number!

376
00:50:11,323 --> 00:50:14,588
All's well!

377
00:50:18,831 --> 00:50:23,427
<i>Teen</i> Number! All's well!

378
00:50:25,938 --> 00:50:30,841
<i>Chaar</i> Number! All's well!

379
00:50:46,125 --> 00:50:51,028
<i>Paanch</i> Number! All's well!

380
00:50:56,135 --> 00:50:59,161
Swing those picks there.
You think this is a strawberry festival?

381
00:50:59,238 --> 00:51:03,368
Shake a leg with that pole.
Come on, get it up there at the double.

382
00:51:04,276 --> 00:51:07,211
This is a fine time for things to go quiet.

383
00:51:08,547 --> 00:51:10,174
Blast them Thugs.

384
00:51:10,416 --> 00:51:13,249
Why don't they come
and give us a good fight?

385
00:51:13,319 --> 00:51:15,947
Then Bal will be a pipe to re-enlist.

386
00:51:16,222 --> 00:51:17,780
Come on, hurry up, I told you.

387
00:51:17,857 --> 00:51:20,553
How can we get a nice little war going?

388
00:51:23,596 --> 00:51:27,794
What if I were to blow up the Taj Mahal
or one of them sacred tombs?

389
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:30,391
What do you want to do,
start the Indian Mutiny again?

390
00:51:30,469 --> 00:51:33,029
Annie, get your back into it! Hurry up!

391
00:51:33,105 --> 00:51:35,835
He's even snarling at poor little Annie.

392
00:51:36,008 --> 00:51:38,238
You can't work 24 hours a day, you know.

393
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:40,574
In another 24 hours, my time will be up.

394
00:51:40,646 --> 00:51:43,376
I don't want to leave anything undone
that might detain me.

395
00:51:43,449 --> 00:51:44,711
Get it up, hurry up.

396
00:51:44,783 --> 00:51:46,182
He's tired.

397
00:51:46,819 --> 00:51:50,016
It just goes to show you
what a piece of dry goods will do.

398
00:51:50,089 --> 00:51:52,421
A brilliant bloke like him, too.

399
00:51:53,659 --> 00:51:55,991
Cutter, we got to do something.

400
00:51:58,697 --> 00:52:00,028
Come here.

401
00:52:15,214 --> 00:52:17,842
- What now?
- Look, Mac...

402
00:52:18,317 --> 00:52:22,447
for four days we've been waiting
for them Thugs to start something.

403
00:52:22,821 --> 00:52:25,517
Four days in this cruel heat
and horrible tension.

404
00:52:25,591 --> 00:52:29,118
- What's that to do with Ballantine?
- I'm coming to that.

405
00:52:29,261 --> 00:52:31,058
Go on.

406
00:52:36,302 --> 00:52:39,430
Three hours from where we're sitting,
by a secret trail...

407
00:52:39,505 --> 00:52:43,566
there's a gold temple
waiting to be sliced away and carried off.

408
00:52:45,444 --> 00:52:48,641
Have you started after
this buried treasure again?

409
00:52:50,149 --> 00:52:52,276
Just a minute, Mac. This one ain't buried.

410
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:55,252
According to Gunga Din,
it's standing right out in the open.

411
00:52:55,321 --> 00:52:57,255
According to Gunga Din, eh?

412
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:00,752
I thought he might have been
at the bottom of this.

413
00:53:00,826 --> 00:53:02,885
What's the idea of this lushing?

414
00:53:02,962 --> 00:53:05,328
- Give me that bottle.
- Wait!

415
00:53:06,332 --> 00:53:08,232
Just a minute.

416
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:12,066
MacChesney, I'm here to speak,
and I'm going to have my say.

417
00:53:13,539 --> 00:53:15,666
You want Ballantine to stay with us,
don't you?

418
00:53:15,741 --> 00:53:19,336
- Of course I want him to stay.
- All right. Just a minute.

419
00:53:20,279 --> 00:53:21,746
It's as easy as parting your hair.

420
00:53:21,814 --> 00:53:24,476
We take Bal to the temple,
show him the gold...

421
00:53:24,550 --> 00:53:26,518
and the moment he starts slicing at it...

422
00:53:26,585 --> 00:53:29,213
marriage and the tea business
will whiz from his mind.

423
00:53:29,288 --> 00:53:32,189
MacChesney, versus that,
you can't think of a single argument.

424
00:53:32,257 --> 00:53:34,088
Cutter, I'm warning you.

425
00:53:34,159 --> 00:53:36,753
- What's the matter with you?
- What's the matter with me?

426
00:53:36,829 --> 00:53:39,354
I'm sick of it! Now shut your trap.

427
00:53:42,334 --> 00:53:44,461
- You mean you won't go?
- No!

428
00:53:44,536 --> 00:53:46,936
And if you mention
gold temples again to me...

429
00:53:47,006 --> 00:53:50,066
I'll tear the back right off you
with a shovel.

430
00:53:51,043 --> 00:53:53,409
Very well, MacChesney,
you made your choice.

431
00:53:53,479 --> 00:53:55,538
I offered you the chance
to be a millionaire...

432
00:53:55,614 --> 00:53:56,876
and you turned it down.

433
00:53:56,949 --> 00:53:59,440
All right, I'm going alone.

434
00:54:02,021 --> 00:54:03,545
Wait a minute!

435
00:54:04,456 --> 00:54:07,584
Cutter, you ain't leaving this village
without my permission.

436
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:09,457
Give me that bottle.

437
00:54:10,629 --> 00:54:13,860
I've been a soldier for 14 years.
I know my duties as well as you do.

438
00:54:13,932 --> 00:54:17,368
But you're not talking to a soldier now,
you're talking to an expedition.

439
00:54:17,436 --> 00:54:19,836
I'm an expedition. Out of my way.

440
00:54:20,105 --> 00:54:22,938
Cutter, sit down before I throw you down.

441
00:54:23,042 --> 00:54:25,943
Make way for the expedition,
if you know what's good for you.

442
00:54:27,112 --> 00:54:28,739
Goodbye forever.

443
00:54:30,082 --> 00:54:31,481
Stand back.

444
00:54:32,251 --> 00:54:34,947
I'll throw you in the clink
if you make a move.

445
00:54:36,922 --> 00:54:39,083
Out of my way before I split your jaw.

446
00:54:39,158 --> 00:54:42,719
- Cutter, I'm warning you.
- Come on, put 'em up.

447
00:54:49,868 --> 00:54:51,802
Come on, out of my way.

448
00:54:52,237 --> 00:54:55,400
I'll bash your ugly face in,
that's what I'll do.

449
00:54:58,210 --> 00:55:01,077
Come on, put 'em up.

450
00:55:03,015 --> 00:55:05,142
I'm afraid I have to do it.

451
00:55:07,486 --> 00:55:09,181
Sgt. Ballantine.

452
00:55:12,591 --> 00:55:14,218
- What?
- Come here.

453
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:19,924
Poor fellow's taken with a dizzy spell.
Lock him up safely until he comes to.

454
00:55:22,334 --> 00:55:25,735
I'll lock him up. I'm only sorry
you didn't have a dizzy spell, too.

455
00:55:25,804 --> 00:55:28,364
Then I'd lock you both up
at the same time.

456
00:55:58,470 --> 00:56:00,495
Good old Din. What's up?

457
00:56:00,773 --> 00:56:04,641
Tonight, when everyone sleep,
Din go back again.

458
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:07,110
- See gold.
- You did?

459
00:56:07,179 --> 00:56:09,340
Where is it?
Didn't you bring any with you?

460
00:56:09,414 --> 00:56:12,247
<i>Bhisti</i> cannot carry whole temple.

461
00:56:13,919 --> 00:56:17,116
- Whole temple?
- Din see it. All gold.

462
00:56:20,926 --> 00:56:23,224
Here, now.
We've got to get out of here now.

463
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:26,355
Get me some tools
that I can rip these blinking bars out with.

464
00:56:26,431 --> 00:56:29,093
- Already bring all tools could find.
- Yeah.

465
00:56:29,168 --> 00:56:31,295
Is this satisfactory, <i>sahib?</i>

466
00:56:34,039 --> 00:56:36,303
Think I want
to break out of a blooming pudding?

467
00:56:36,375 --> 00:56:38,809
Go on, get something big. <i>Jaldi!</i>

468
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:54,452
Up, Annie. Please, Annie.

469
00:57:38,770 --> 00:57:40,635
What are you doing, Din?

470
00:57:40,839 --> 00:57:43,307
A large tool you asked for, <i>sahib.</i>

471
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:49,709
Annie, come on,
pull these blinking bars out for me.

472
00:57:49,848 --> 00:57:52,510
Work for me. Get me out of here, Annie.

473
00:57:53,485 --> 00:57:57,182
Come on, Annie. Be a good girl.
Whoa, Annie! Just the bars!

474
00:58:44,369 --> 00:58:46,030
Alert the guards!

475
00:58:48,507 --> 00:58:49,804
- Wake up!
- What?

476
00:58:49,875 --> 00:58:51,035
The Thugs are here!

477
00:58:51,109 --> 00:58:54,169
Why didn't you say so?
I'd like to get a crack at them.

478
00:58:57,282 --> 00:58:58,306
What happened?

479
00:58:58,383 --> 00:59:01,284
- Dacoits slipped in and stole elephant.
- What's that?

480
00:59:01,353 --> 00:59:02,684
Thugs stole Annie.

481
00:59:02,754 --> 00:59:06,190
Stole Annie? They'll stoop to anything.
How many were there?

482
00:59:06,258 --> 00:59:07,725
- Couldn't see.
- Where did they go?

483
00:59:07,793 --> 00:59:09,283
- The hills.
- Sound assembly.

484
00:59:09,361 --> 00:59:12,023
Sgt. Ballantine,
pick 16 men and follow me.

485
00:59:12,097 --> 00:59:15,191
MacCheesecake, if this is
another of your tricks...

486
00:59:15,267 --> 00:59:17,963
Fall in the remainder!
Put every man on guard duty!

487
00:59:18,036 --> 00:59:19,901
- Very good, sir.
- Steal Annie, will they?

488
00:59:19,972 --> 00:59:22,600
I'll break every Thug's back in India!

489
00:59:43,762 --> 00:59:46,663
Din, are you sure you're on the right trail?

490
00:59:46,732 --> 00:59:49,963
Yes, <i>sahib.</i> Here is the bridge, <i>sahib.</i>

491
01:00:09,054 --> 01:00:11,989
- Is this bridge safe?
- It's safe, <i>sahib.</i>

492
01:00:17,829 --> 01:00:20,127
Safe? What do you mean, safe?

493
01:00:34,012 --> 01:00:36,845
Make her stop that.
She's making me nervous.

494
01:00:40,852 --> 01:00:42,615
Get out of my way.

495
01:00:46,024 --> 01:00:48,288
It's no time to do a thing like that!

496
01:00:51,563 --> 01:00:53,656
Annie! Take your foot off.

497
01:00:58,503 --> 01:01:00,971
Annie! Take your trunk off.

498
01:01:01,540 --> 01:01:03,405
Annie, please go back!

499
01:01:40,112 --> 01:01:41,875
That's gold, bugler.

500
01:01:42,681 --> 01:01:44,444
Look at it, bugler.

501
01:01:44,749 --> 01:01:46,808
That's yours and mine.

502
01:01:47,018 --> 01:01:50,681
Archibald Cutter, the blooming duke,
look at me, and Rajah Gunga Din...

503
01:01:50,755 --> 01:01:54,020
pouring diamonds
out of that there blinking water bag.

504
01:01:54,126 --> 01:01:56,287
Bugle will be very satisfactory.

505
01:01:57,362 --> 01:01:59,728
Come on, Din. The world is ours.

506
01:03:22,414 --> 01:03:25,941
Kali. <i>Sahib,</i> come quick.

507
01:04:12,664 --> 01:04:15,258
Thugs, lift up your faces...

508
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:18,268
to the light that shines from Kali's throne.

509
01:04:24,276 --> 01:04:26,176
Brothers in Thuggee...

510
01:04:26,244 --> 01:04:28,769
we are the friendless of this earth.

511
01:04:29,014 --> 01:04:31,346
Every man's hand is against us.

512
01:04:31,883 --> 01:04:33,908
We have been kicked, spat upon...

513
01:04:33,985 --> 01:04:36,783
and driven to the hills like wild things.

514
01:04:37,989 --> 01:04:41,220
My father was a Thug, and he was hanged.

515
01:04:42,093 --> 01:04:44,994
His father was blown
from a cannon's mouth.

516
01:04:45,930 --> 01:04:48,922
And what of your kinsmen,
your fathers and their fathers...

517
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:51,594
and their fathers' fathers before them?

518
01:04:51,670 --> 01:04:55,037
My brothers, a new day is at hand.

519
01:04:57,208 --> 01:05:00,177
I have read the omens, and they are good.

520
01:05:00,779 --> 01:05:04,010
Three nights ago,
a jackal screamed upon the left.

521
01:05:04,416 --> 01:05:07,180
Another answered from the right at once.

522
01:05:12,991 --> 01:05:15,459
What does that mean, my brothers?

523
01:05:15,527 --> 01:05:19,293
It means that Mother Kali,
with all her arms outstretched...

524
01:05:19,397 --> 01:05:23,731
hugs us to her bosom,
welcoming us back as Thugs...

525
01:05:24,202 --> 01:05:27,194
Thugs awakened from a sleep...

526
01:05:29,674 --> 01:05:31,403
of 50 years.

527
01:05:32,944 --> 01:05:36,277
Let the neophytes
and their teachers draw near.

528
01:05:46,758 --> 01:05:48,749
Where are the stranglers?

529
01:05:51,796 --> 01:05:54,230
Give them their strangling cloths.

530
01:05:59,537 --> 01:06:01,767
Give them their burial picks.

531
01:06:05,210 --> 01:06:07,371
Swear by our Mother Kali...

532
01:06:07,545 --> 01:06:10,878
to be thrice faithful to her
and to me and to our order...

533
01:06:11,149 --> 01:06:12,776
and to all of us.

534
01:06:17,322 --> 01:06:19,722
Rise, our new-made brothers.

535
01:06:20,191 --> 01:06:21,783
Rise and kill.

536
01:06:22,827 --> 01:06:25,421
Kill, lest you be killed yourselves.

537
01:06:25,597 --> 01:06:27,565
Kill for the love of killing.

538
01:06:27,632 --> 01:06:31,033
Kill for the love of Kali. Kill!

539
01:06:59,464 --> 01:07:02,228
It's them all right, Din,
the whole blinking lot of them.

540
01:07:02,300 --> 01:07:03,767
Very bad men.

541
01:07:09,441 --> 01:07:11,500
The Colonel's got to know.

542
01:08:31,890 --> 01:08:34,688
You must get there, Din.
The Colonel's got to know.

543
01:08:34,759 --> 01:08:37,023
The Colonel? I run quick.

544
01:08:53,912 --> 01:08:56,312
<i>Since mighty roast beef</i>
<i>is an Englishman's food</i>

545
01:08:56,381 --> 01:08:59,009
<i>It accounts for the freedom</i>
<i>that runs in his blood</i>

546
01:08:59,083 --> 01:09:01,313
<i>For generous living</i>
<i>Does it do all good</i>

547
01:09:01,386 --> 01:09:02,751
Excuse me, mates.

548
01:09:03,688 --> 01:09:08,591
<i>Oh, the roast beef of England</i>
<i>And, oh, the old English roast beef</i>

549
01:09:15,733 --> 01:09:17,724
Sing us a song, will you?

550
01:09:27,745 --> 01:09:29,713
You're all under arrest.

551
01:09:30,848 --> 01:09:34,011
The whole bunch of you.
And you, too. You know why?

552
01:09:34,085 --> 01:09:37,054
Her Majesty's very touchy
about having her subjects strangled.

553
01:09:37,121 --> 01:09:38,918
I can't waste any more time.

554
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:41,720
Come on, wrap up your gear.
You're coming with me. Hurry up.

555
01:09:41,793 --> 01:09:42,782
<i>Guruji.</i>

556
01:09:44,062 --> 01:09:47,259
If it ain't young Toad Face.
Fancy meeting you here.

557
01:09:47,332 --> 01:09:48,629
Vile dog.

558
01:09:49,567 --> 01:09:52,297
For that insolence,
you shall grovel before my son.

559
01:09:52,370 --> 01:09:53,962
You shall grovel, I say!

560
01:09:54,105 --> 01:09:55,129
Look here.

561
01:09:55,206 --> 01:09:59,370
I'm a soldier of Her Majesty the Queen,
and I don't grovel before any heathen.

562
01:09:59,444 --> 01:10:02,208
Kabul, take him to the tower...

563
01:10:02,280 --> 01:10:04,976
and teach him the error of false pride.

564
01:10:05,984 --> 01:10:07,474
Take him away!

565
01:10:24,669 --> 01:10:28,696
In those drear gray hours before dawn,
just go out and chase elephants.

566
01:10:28,773 --> 01:10:30,638
Beats counting sheep a million miles.

567
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:32,699
What do you mean, elephants?

568
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:36,211
This ain't elephants.
This is Annie, my Annie.

569
01:10:36,748 --> 01:10:39,649
I'll find her if I have to turn out
the whole British Army.

570
01:10:39,717 --> 01:10:41,685
What the blazes is this?

571
01:10:42,587 --> 01:10:44,179
Good morning, gentlemen.

572
01:10:44,255 --> 01:10:46,780
Good morning.
What the blazes are you here for?

573
01:10:46,858 --> 01:10:48,792
I've come to replace Sgt. Ballantine.

574
01:10:48,860 --> 01:10:51,351
Higginbotham,
I could just fall on your neck.

575
01:10:51,896 --> 01:10:54,364
I got a better neck than mine
you can fall on.

576
01:10:54,432 --> 01:10:56,195
That's a good one. Hello, there!

577
01:10:56,768 --> 01:10:58,463
Tommy, hello!

578
01:11:01,606 --> 01:11:03,972
How wonderful of you to meet us.

579
01:11:04,409 --> 01:11:08,209
I came here to surprise you,
and here you are, surprising me.

580
01:11:09,614 --> 01:11:13,141
- Good morning, Sgt. MacChesney.
- Good morning, Miss.

581
01:11:13,317 --> 01:11:15,751
Here are Tommy's discharge papers.

582
01:11:17,422 --> 01:11:20,118
Cutter will be very pleased about this.

583
01:11:21,359 --> 01:11:23,793
- Column of threes!
- Eyes front!

584
01:11:23,861 --> 01:11:25,385
Sit up straight there!

585
01:11:25,463 --> 01:11:29,160
Who do you think you are,
a lot of blinking nursemaids in Hyde Park?

586
01:11:35,640 --> 01:11:37,039
Walk march!

587
01:11:44,682 --> 01:11:46,115
Forward!

588
01:11:47,952 --> 01:11:49,510
Party, halt!

589
01:11:57,729 --> 01:11:59,390
Sgt. Ballantine, take charge.

590
01:11:59,464 --> 01:12:01,227
Go inside, dear. I'll be right with you.

591
01:12:01,299 --> 01:12:03,927
All right, but do hurry,
so we can leave soon.

592
01:12:05,403 --> 01:12:08,668
<i>- Naik,</i> what about this?
- He just came back, Sergeant <i>sahib.</i>

593
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:11,008
Come here, you.

594
01:12:11,943 --> 01:12:14,969
Din, I knew you was at the bottom
of all this.

595
01:12:15,646 --> 01:12:18,672
Didn't you knock down the shed
and take off Sgt. Cutter?

596
01:12:18,750 --> 01:12:22,083
You'll answer to me.
We'll have a court-martial here and now.

597
01:12:22,153 --> 01:12:24,178
- Line up a firing squad.
- Please, <i>sahib.</i>

598
01:12:24,255 --> 01:12:26,985
You stole the elephant, didn't you?
Answer me!

599
01:12:27,058 --> 01:12:30,255
You knocked down a building
and liberated Her Majesty's prisoner...

600
01:12:30,328 --> 01:12:32,455
Sgt. Cutter, didn't you?

601
01:12:33,164 --> 01:12:35,928
- Yes, <i>sahib.</i>
- That's all! Take him away!

602
01:12:36,000 --> 01:12:39,663
You Lazarushian beggar,
it'll be the firing squad for you this time!

603
01:12:39,737 --> 01:12:42,228
Wait a minute, Mac. Where's Cutter?

604
01:12:42,774 --> 01:12:44,765
Din, where is Sgt. Cutter?

605
01:12:44,842 --> 01:12:47,276
- They catch him.
- What's that? Who?

606
01:12:47,779 --> 01:12:50,077
In the gold temple, they catch Sgt. Cutter.

607
01:12:50,148 --> 01:12:52,412
Who's they? Priests or what?

608
01:12:52,483 --> 01:12:56,442
Very bad men. They'll give him torture.
Go help, quick.

609
01:12:56,521 --> 01:12:57,749
- How many men?
- Don't know.

610
01:12:57,822 --> 01:13:00,689
- I run away quick to bring help.
- I'll bet you ran away quick.

611
01:13:00,758 --> 01:13:03,784
And you'll run back just as quick, too.
Show me the way.

612
01:13:03,861 --> 01:13:07,729
- I'll pick a dozen men.
- You'll pick nothing! I'm going alone.

613
01:13:08,499 --> 01:13:09,523
You haven't a chance.

614
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,761
I'm not killing Cutter by riding in
with a troop.

615
01:13:11,836 --> 01:13:13,963
They'll cut him up
if we have a rescue party.

616
01:13:14,038 --> 01:13:15,369
- Right. We'll go together.
- No.

617
01:13:15,439 --> 01:13:16,906
Tommy, what's the matter?

618
01:13:16,974 --> 01:13:20,603
Cutter got himself into a mess,
and Mac and I are going to get him out.

619
01:13:20,678 --> 01:13:22,339
Don't worry, I'm not taking him.

620
01:13:22,413 --> 01:13:24,904
I'm going as a sergeant
in Her Majesty's service.

621
01:13:24,982 --> 01:13:28,042
- I'm not taking any civilians with me.
- Who's a civilian?

622
01:13:28,119 --> 01:13:30,212
It says here,
"Thomas Anthony Ballantine...

623
01:13:30,288 --> 01:13:32,756
"is restored
to the rank of citizen of Great Britain...

624
01:13:32,824 --> 01:13:35,725
"and his duty to Her Majesty's service
is over and done with."

625
01:13:35,793 --> 01:13:37,021
Try and keep me out of this.

626
01:13:37,094 --> 01:13:40,325
I'm saying goodbye, Bal,
and I wish you luck in the tea business...

627
01:13:40,398 --> 01:13:42,366
and your matrimony both.

628
01:13:43,467 --> 01:13:46,402
Wait a minute, Mac.
Wait right here. I have to talk to him.

629
01:13:46,470 --> 01:13:48,665
- But he said you can't go.
- He'll change his mind.

630
01:13:48,739 --> 01:13:51,867
- I won't let you go!
- Darling, I have to go. I owe it to Cutter.

631
01:13:51,943 --> 01:13:54,776
- He's saved my life time and again.
- You don't love me.

632
01:13:54,846 --> 01:13:57,815
Do you want me to go through life
remembering that I ran out...

633
01:13:57,882 --> 01:13:59,543
on one of my two best friends?

634
01:13:59,617 --> 01:14:02,848
After what they did to Higginbotham,
and dragging you up here again?

635
01:14:02,920 --> 01:14:05,013
That's just the way of showing
their friendship.

636
01:14:05,089 --> 01:14:08,957
I hate the army, I'm through with it,
but friendship, that's something else.

637
01:14:09,026 --> 01:14:12,689
But we're wasting valuable time.
You have to understand. I'll be right back.

638
01:14:12,763 --> 01:14:15,391
- I want to talk to you.
- You? I don't want to argue...

639
01:14:15,466 --> 01:14:17,491
I'm going if I have to shoot you
and go alone.

640
01:14:17,568 --> 01:14:19,536
You know as well as I do why you can't go.

641
01:14:19,604 --> 01:14:22,437
If anything happens to you,
I'd be in a fine mess.

642
01:14:22,506 --> 01:14:23,939
Your girl would prefer charges.

643
01:14:24,008 --> 01:14:26,408
- She wouldn't.
- I don't trust her.

644
01:14:28,145 --> 01:14:29,612
There's only one way I'll risk it.

645
01:14:29,680 --> 01:14:31,614
- What's that?
- For you to sign up.

646
01:14:31,682 --> 01:14:33,650
When we get Cutter,
we'll tear up the papers.

647
01:14:33,718 --> 01:14:36,983
It'll be according to regulations.
Is that fair enough for you?

648
01:14:37,054 --> 01:14:38,487
You're getting clever again.

649
01:14:38,556 --> 01:14:41,081
Do you want me
to get kicked out of the army?

650
01:14:41,158 --> 01:14:43,718
All right, I'll sign, but on one condition.

651
01:14:43,794 --> 01:14:47,355
That I hold the blank in my hand
and I keep it after I'm through.

652
01:14:49,000 --> 01:14:50,729
You don't trust me.

653
01:14:51,903 --> 01:14:53,393
That's right.

654
01:14:58,876 --> 01:15:00,241
All right.

655
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:10,880
What are you doing
with that in your pocket?

656
01:15:10,955 --> 01:15:13,355
I always carry one. In case.

657
01:15:26,304 --> 01:15:27,828
No, you don't.

658
01:15:29,707 --> 01:15:33,234
Not a word of this to Emmy,
you understand? Shake on it?

659
01:15:34,145 --> 01:15:35,407
Hurry up.

660
01:15:37,715 --> 01:15:38,807
Excuse me, miss.

661
01:15:39,083 --> 01:15:42,712
Sgt. Ballantine and I are going out
on a reconnoitering expedition.

662
01:15:42,787 --> 01:15:44,652
- Yes, sir.
- If we're not back by morning...

663
01:15:44,722 --> 01:15:46,917
inform the Colonel,
and you follow our trail.

664
01:15:46,991 --> 01:15:49,619
- Come this way.
- Excuse me, Miss Stebbins.

665
01:15:49,694 --> 01:15:52,959
- I'm going, Emmy. He's changed his mind.
- Who made him change it?

666
01:15:53,030 --> 01:15:55,726
- Reason and common decency.
- You're lying.

667
01:15:56,400 --> 01:15:59,858
Would I lie at a time like this,
just before our wedding? Be reasonable.

668
01:15:59,937 --> 01:16:01,928
You didn't sign anything?

669
01:16:02,974 --> 01:16:05,670
Why ask a question like that?
Do I look that stupid?

670
01:16:05,743 --> 01:16:09,270
Just pretend I'm going off on a picnic.
That's all it'll amount to.

671
01:16:09,347 --> 01:16:13,374
We'll get Cutter out of that gold temple
without firing a shot, just by strategy.

672
01:16:13,451 --> 01:16:16,249
We've done things like this before.
It's just a lot of fun.

673
01:16:16,320 --> 01:16:18,880
- Fun? You want to go.
- Darling...

674
01:16:18,956 --> 01:16:20,981
- Sgt. Ballantine, fall in!
- Right, sir.

675
01:16:21,058 --> 01:16:24,550
He called you sergeant.
Why? You're not in the army.

676
01:16:24,628 --> 01:16:27,426
It's just an old habit, hard to break.
I'll see you tomorrow.

677
01:16:27,498 --> 01:16:30,729
Why don't you come right out
and say you don't want to get married?

678
01:16:30,801 --> 01:16:32,029
You'd rather be with him.

679
01:16:32,103 --> 01:16:35,334
Why fool me by telling me
how you hated him and his ugly face...

680
01:16:35,406 --> 01:16:37,135
and all the ugly faces in the army?

681
01:16:37,208 --> 01:16:40,644
- I didn't say quite that. Be fair.
- Please, <i>sahib,</i> hurry.

682
01:16:40,711 --> 01:16:43,145
- Come on, Sergeant!
- Can't you wait a minute?

683
01:16:43,214 --> 01:16:46,308
Sure, I can wait,
but I'm not so sure about Cutter.

684
01:16:46,384 --> 01:16:49,615
- Can't you trust me? Kiss me goodbye.
- No, never.

685
01:16:49,687 --> 01:16:52,485
They're probably
slicing Cutter's ears off by now.

686
01:16:52,556 --> 01:16:55,491
- I'm coming, Mac!
- Darling, please don't go.

687
01:16:56,160 --> 01:16:57,923
You don't want a man for a husband.

688
01:16:57,995 --> 01:17:00,486
You want a coward
who'll run out on a friend in danger.

689
01:17:00,564 --> 01:17:02,293
That's not me, and never will be.

690
01:17:02,366 --> 01:17:04,926
I don't care how much I love you,
and I do, very much...

691
01:17:05,002 --> 01:17:07,869
I'm a soldier... I mean, I'm a man first.

692
01:17:10,975 --> 01:17:14,138
All right, MacCheesecake,
get that silly smirk off your face.

693
01:17:14,211 --> 01:17:16,839
- Come on.
- Let's go.

694
01:17:48,646 --> 01:17:51,114
Surely Mother Kali is kind.

695
01:17:51,782 --> 01:17:56,014
One Englishman fly walks in,
and now our web is baited.

696
01:17:56,253 --> 01:17:57,880
More will follow.

697
01:17:58,155 --> 01:18:00,953
Two more have crossed the bridge.

698
01:18:01,025 --> 01:18:04,085
It is well. Prepare.

699
01:19:06,490 --> 01:19:08,822
You said this place was full of priests.

700
01:19:08,893 --> 01:19:12,260
<i>- Sahib</i> do not give Din chance to say.
- You've got a mouth, haven't you?

701
01:19:12,329 --> 01:19:14,422
Quiet. It's Kali.

702
01:19:17,935 --> 01:19:21,837
A Thug temple.
Why didn't you tell me they were Thugs?

703
01:19:21,906 --> 01:19:25,535
I've a good mind to split you in two
and stuff you up an elephant's trunk.

704
01:19:25,609 --> 01:19:26,837
MacChesney roar so loud...

705
01:19:26,911 --> 01:19:29,709
poor <i>bhisti</i> cannot get a word sideways
between roarings.

706
01:19:29,780 --> 01:19:32,613
Enough of that. We're here to find Cutter.

707
01:19:45,529 --> 01:19:48,020
We should have brought every man
in the regiment.

708
01:19:48,098 --> 01:19:49,588
I only wish you had, <i>sahib.</i>

709
01:20:14,158 --> 01:20:15,352
Hello, Din.

710
01:20:16,794 --> 01:20:19,422
Fine work, bugler. I knew you'd do it.

711
01:20:20,598 --> 01:20:22,225
Thank you, <i>sahib.</i>

712
01:20:24,935 --> 01:20:26,800
- Hello, boy.
- Hello, mate.

713
01:20:26,870 --> 01:20:29,964
You're alive, anyway. What's this?
I'll chop you down right away.

714
01:20:30,040 --> 01:20:33,373
So there you are, you white-livered
elephant-stealing treasure hunter.

715
01:20:33,444 --> 01:20:36,811
Look at you, hanging there
like a lamb in a butcher's shop.

716
01:20:36,880 --> 01:20:38,108
Where's the troop?

717
01:20:38,182 --> 01:20:42,243
There's no troop, and the Guru has us.
We right walked into it.

718
01:20:42,920 --> 01:20:45,616
You mean to tell me
you didn't bring the troop?

719
01:20:45,723 --> 01:20:47,213
What a brain!

720
01:20:47,625 --> 01:20:51,117
I round up every Thug in India,
and you mess it up with that pygmy brain!

721
01:20:51,195 --> 01:20:55,097
I couldn't face my own men
if I brought them to witness your shame...

722
01:20:55,165 --> 01:20:57,224
disgracing Her Majesty's uniform.

723
01:20:57,368 --> 01:21:00,929
Shame? They're doing this to me
to find out where the column is.

724
01:21:01,005 --> 01:21:04,236
They plan to ambush and massacre
the Colonel and the whole troop.

725
01:21:04,308 --> 01:21:06,037
- You didn't tell them, did you?
- Not me.

726
01:21:06,110 --> 01:21:08,738
So I suppose you think you're a hero?

727
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:12,313
- That's right.
- A hero. Don't make me laugh.

728
01:21:12,383 --> 01:21:14,715
Every man at the post
looking for these blighters...

729
01:21:14,785 --> 01:21:16,912
and I reconnoiter adroitly
and encounter them...

730
01:21:16,987 --> 01:21:21,014
while you cowards hide behind
your telegraph poles in Tantrapur.

731
01:21:21,091 --> 01:21:22,490
Who's a coward?

732
01:21:23,627 --> 01:21:25,993
- Untie him, will you?
- Yes. Untie me.

733
01:21:26,063 --> 01:21:30,727
I said untie him!
Sgt. Ballantine, untie that man!

734
01:21:31,168 --> 01:21:33,659
You displease me greatly,
and I ignore the both of you.

735
01:21:33,737 --> 01:21:36,001
- I'll untie him myself.
- Yes, that's right.

736
01:21:36,073 --> 01:21:38,871
Only one hand, that's all I need at you.
Just one hand.

737
01:21:38,942 --> 01:21:42,378
- Hurry up about it.
- I'll take all day, if you order me around.

738
01:21:42,913 --> 01:21:44,778
I owe you one, anyway.

739
01:21:45,683 --> 01:21:48,550
Mate, look at your back.

740
01:21:49,753 --> 01:21:53,553
- Never mind that. Untie my hands.
- Just look what they did to you.

741
01:21:54,291 --> 01:21:57,454
I'm sorry, mate. The fiends!

742
01:22:00,297 --> 01:22:01,662
- The Guru.
- Filthy scum.

743
01:22:01,732 --> 01:22:02,824
- Dog.
- Maniac.

744
01:22:02,900 --> 01:22:04,800
- Let's get him.
- Here we go.

745
01:22:04,868 --> 01:22:07,860
Grab him regardless how many
are with him. It's our only chance.

746
01:22:07,938 --> 01:22:10,498
He's sacred, so they won't shoot us.

747
01:22:19,650 --> 01:22:21,117
Why, you hairless dog.

748
01:22:21,185 --> 01:22:23,881
Look what you did to that man's back,
you filthy...

749
01:22:23,954 --> 01:22:27,048
A lesson
in the error of false pride, Sergeant.

750
01:22:28,158 --> 01:22:30,251
You're talking very proudly yourself.

751
01:22:30,327 --> 01:22:34,354
Perhaps you're not too proud
to give a little information I seek.

752
01:22:35,532 --> 01:22:39,332
- I want to know about your army.
- Why don't you enlist, mate?

753
01:22:44,007 --> 01:22:45,133
Lash.

754
01:22:47,478 --> 01:22:49,878
For a beginning, this is not bad.

755
01:22:50,280 --> 01:22:53,113
Three soldiers to be given to Mother Kali...

756
01:22:53,183 --> 01:22:55,378
three soldiers and a slave.

757
01:22:56,086 --> 01:23:00,182
- Who is slave? I am a soldier, too, please.
- You're what?

758
01:23:02,326 --> 01:23:03,987
Regimental <i>bhisti.</i>

759
01:23:06,530 --> 01:23:10,796
Proud ox, where is your army?
How soon are they to follow?

760
01:23:11,835 --> 01:23:13,200
Wouldn't you like to know?

761
01:23:13,270 --> 01:23:15,795
Why don't you look in your crystal ball?

762
01:23:17,007 --> 01:23:18,941
Make the ox talk.

763
01:23:25,582 --> 01:23:27,607
You dirty pack of cowards!

764
01:23:30,087 --> 01:23:33,716
Never mind him. Now. He's next.

765
01:23:36,326 --> 01:23:39,818
- I'm waiting. Will you speak?
- I don't know.

766
01:23:39,963 --> 01:23:42,022
Hold on, Mac, old boy!

767
01:23:45,469 --> 01:23:46,527
Stop.

768
01:24:00,684 --> 01:24:03,881
Look. See them down there...

769
01:24:04,254 --> 01:24:08,281
coiling and wiggling,
sticking their pretty tongues out?

770
01:24:10,127 --> 01:24:12,061
Are you going to speak?

771
01:24:13,597 --> 01:24:15,895
Throw him in. He'll talk from there.

772
01:24:15,966 --> 01:24:19,595
- No, I can't stand it!
- Will you speak?

773
01:24:21,772 --> 01:24:23,501
All right.

774
01:24:24,107 --> 01:24:27,076
If I ain't kissed
by one of them snakes, I'll tell you.

775
01:24:28,612 --> 01:24:30,204
Take me outside.

776
01:24:32,316 --> 01:24:35,012
- Be a man, Mac.
- I can't go it, mates!

777
01:24:35,085 --> 01:24:37,417
Come back, Mac, old boy!

778
01:24:50,234 --> 01:24:52,759
- Well, Sergeant?
- All right, guvnor.

779
01:24:53,103 --> 01:24:56,231
I don't know
the exact position of the troops...

780
01:24:56,473 --> 01:25:01,206
but in Ballantine's pocket there's a paper
with all the troop movements in it.

781
01:25:01,879 --> 01:25:05,042
- You're sure of that, Sergeant?
- As sure as taxes, guvnor.

782
01:25:05,115 --> 01:25:07,515
- I wouldn't fool you.
- I hope not.

783
01:25:07,584 --> 01:25:09,984
If you have, there'll be worse than lashes.

784
01:25:10,053 --> 01:25:12,521
Please don't lash me any more.

785
01:25:21,632 --> 01:25:23,691
I'll relieve you of these.

786
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:54,920
Cut him down.

787
01:25:56,333 --> 01:25:59,325
"Sgt. Thomas Ballantine hereby reenlists."

788
01:26:01,004 --> 01:26:03,768
That's you, MacChesney,
always hiding behind regulations...

789
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:05,273
you Brummagem turncoat!

790
01:26:05,342 --> 01:26:07,105
Be gallant in defeat, Sergeant.

791
01:26:07,177 --> 01:26:09,145
You're simply
a victim of superior strategy.

792
01:26:09,212 --> 01:26:13,239
Quiet, you Whitechapel scum, or I'll
cut your slaggedy hands off at the wrist!

793
01:26:13,317 --> 01:26:17,754
- I'll pay you back with horrible interest!
- I command you to shut up!

794
01:26:20,357 --> 01:26:24,350
Tell your men to lay down their arms and
get out of here, or you're a dead kipper.

795
01:26:26,096 --> 01:26:28,894
Lay down your arms and leave.

796
01:26:32,102 --> 01:26:35,196
- Where do those stairs lead to?
- Not to freedom.

797
01:26:35,272 --> 01:26:37,832
- We'll see about that. Ready?
- Right.

798
01:26:48,952 --> 01:26:52,080
- Sgt. Cutter, guard that door.
- Right. Mac, take your coat.

799
01:26:52,155 --> 01:26:53,679
Right. Get up.

800
01:27:18,849 --> 01:27:22,250
It's young Toad Face blazing up the Thugs.
I'll start with him first.

801
01:27:22,319 --> 01:27:23,809
No, you won't.

802
01:27:29,926 --> 01:27:33,327
Gentlemen, what do you think
of your freedom now?

803
01:27:38,535 --> 01:27:42,596
All right, my friend,
if we've got to die, you've got to die, too.

804
01:27:43,106 --> 01:27:45,404
As long as I'm alive, you live.

805
01:28:06,563 --> 01:28:10,090
- What did he say?
- He says he'll be unharmed.

806
01:28:11,001 --> 01:28:14,767
He says to keep order,
be confident, and wait.

807
01:28:15,105 --> 01:28:16,902
Congratulations, Sergeant...

808
01:28:16,973 --> 01:28:19,498
on your knowledge
of our humble language.

809
01:28:19,576 --> 01:28:22,067
That's enough. Get under the shade...

810
01:28:22,145 --> 01:28:25,239
before you get sunstroke.
Go on. Get on back.

811
01:28:34,591 --> 01:28:36,752
Wounds feel satisfactory, <i>sahib?</i>

812
01:28:36,827 --> 01:28:40,263
I ain't had a more satisfactory set of welts
since I ran away from home.

813
01:28:40,330 --> 01:28:42,127
- Thank you.
- Fall in.

814
01:28:43,100 --> 01:28:44,362
Come on.

815
01:28:47,904 --> 01:28:50,532
- Get down. Look out.
- Watch your head.

816
01:28:56,146 --> 01:28:58,273
- The gold!
- Yes, <i>sahib,</i> gold!

817
01:28:59,750 --> 01:29:02,651
Look at it, mates! Gold! That's what it is!

818
01:29:02,753 --> 01:29:05,221
- Real solid sunshine!
- Sit down, you fool!

819
01:29:06,490 --> 01:29:08,151
See that hand sticking out?

820
01:29:08,225 --> 01:29:11,251
I bet that little hand's worth 3,000
if it's worth a farthing!

821
01:29:11,328 --> 01:29:15,128
Who's a blinking idiot now?
We're rich, mates. Come on!

822
01:30:07,784 --> 01:30:11,083
All right, Mr. Wise Man,
here's my last offer.

823
01:30:13,390 --> 01:30:16,553
You order your men
to get in behind them rocks...

824
01:30:17,327 --> 01:30:19,761
and you see us down as far as the bridge.

825
01:30:19,830 --> 01:30:22,924
We'll let you loose,
and there's no harm done.

826
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:24,799
How's that?

827
01:30:38,381 --> 01:30:40,815
Speak, you ape, or I'll kill you.

828
01:30:43,086 --> 01:30:46,180
You would throw away your shield,
brave soldier?

829
01:31:10,647 --> 01:31:14,913
- Do you hear something, Bal?
- The bagpipes, Mac?

830
01:31:16,519 --> 01:31:19,386
I've been hearing them for hours,
but it isn't them.

831
01:31:19,456 --> 01:31:21,651
It's the blistering heat
screaming in our ears...

832
01:31:21,725 --> 01:31:23,955
that makes it sound like it.

833
01:31:30,634 --> 01:31:33,000
They'll pull us out, old boy...

834
01:31:34,905 --> 01:31:37,396
if they can find the blasted place.

835
01:31:38,341 --> 01:31:41,071
Don't waste any of your guff on me, Mac.

836
01:31:41,711 --> 01:31:45,807
Here we are, and this is it.
It might have been worse, though.

837
01:31:48,018 --> 01:31:50,077
I might have left a widow.

838
01:31:57,327 --> 01:32:00,728
Eight feet away from where I'm sitting,
right here...

839
01:32:01,831 --> 01:32:04,891
there's enough gold
to make me sole owner and proprietor...

840
01:32:04,968 --> 01:32:07,596
of a pub as big as the Crystal Palace.

841
01:32:07,671 --> 01:32:11,368
Best pub in Hampshire. And here I am.

842
01:32:13,376 --> 01:32:16,470
You torturer!
Setting that in front of my eyes.

843
01:32:16,613 --> 01:32:19,844
Is there no limit to the torture
an Oriental mind can think up?

844
01:32:19,916 --> 01:32:24,785
So help me, if you mention gold again,
I'll tear the tongue out of your head.

845
01:32:24,921 --> 01:32:26,684
Here it is. Get it.

846
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:33,828
Brave soldiers,
can it be that your nerves are tightening?

847
01:32:36,433 --> 01:32:39,994
We can stand it up here
as long as you can, Mr. Wise Man.

848
01:32:40,403 --> 01:32:44,396
Preserve your courage, gentlemen.
You are not forgotten.

849
01:32:48,378 --> 01:32:50,812
They will come to save you.

850
01:32:52,349 --> 01:32:54,112
That's right, mate.

851
01:32:54,250 --> 01:32:57,617
You're going to see more soldiers
than you ever saw before.

852
01:33:12,802 --> 01:33:15,100
Gentlemen, good news.

853
01:33:15,772 --> 01:33:19,708
Here's a sight that should
make your hearts pound faster. Look.

854
01:33:31,955 --> 01:33:35,152
The Lancers.
Look at the Black Watch out in front.

855
01:33:42,999 --> 01:33:46,298
Those beautiful Scotties.
I'll buy them all a beer apiece.

856
01:33:46,369 --> 01:33:49,429
Your comrades' coming
chokes you with emotions.

857
01:33:51,674 --> 01:33:55,974
Seeing them this way recalls to you
all manner of pleasant things.

858
01:33:56,880 --> 01:34:00,281
The gaiety of barrack life, old friendships...

859
01:34:01,484 --> 01:34:03,679
even England...

860
01:34:05,388 --> 01:34:07,447
even home.

861
01:34:07,791 --> 01:34:09,782
You bet it does, mister.

862
01:34:15,565 --> 01:34:17,556
Save your voices, gentlemen.

863
01:34:17,634 --> 01:34:21,161
They're coming here to your rescue.

864
01:34:22,138 --> 01:34:24,106
You tormenting fiend.

865
01:34:24,674 --> 01:34:28,872
- You're so sure, aren't you?
- Quite sure. It is my plan.

866
01:34:30,213 --> 01:34:32,272
Two come to rescue one...

867
01:34:33,450 --> 01:34:35,384
then the others follow.

868
01:34:38,121 --> 01:34:39,782
If you planned it right, mate...

869
01:34:39,856 --> 01:34:42,723
you'll be hanging by your filthy neck
by nightfall.

870
01:34:42,792 --> 01:34:44,726
You think so, Sergeant?

871
01:34:46,629 --> 01:34:48,256
I'm not so sure.

872
01:34:56,706 --> 01:34:59,800
You seem to think warfare
an English invention.

873
01:35:00,610 --> 01:35:03,511
Have you never heard of
Chandragupta Maurya?

874
01:35:03,580 --> 01:35:04,569
No.

875
01:35:04,781 --> 01:35:08,342
He slaughtered all the armies left in India
by Alexander the Great.

876
01:35:08,418 --> 01:35:10,409
India was a mighty nation then...

877
01:35:10,487 --> 01:35:15,322
while Englishmen still dwelt in caves
and painted themselves blue.

878
01:35:17,727 --> 01:35:18,853
Look.

879
01:35:21,264 --> 01:35:24,529
Don't be afraid, gentlemen.
I am still your shield.

880
01:35:30,340 --> 01:35:34,299
It is very simple.
Your army will enter by that gap.

881
01:35:35,311 --> 01:35:38,246
Then they'll proceed
halfway down this gorge.

882
01:35:38,448 --> 01:35:42,282
Those are my infantry.
The best mountain fighters in the world.

883
01:35:42,619 --> 01:35:46,385
At a given signal,
they will open fire on your troops...

884
01:35:46,956 --> 01:35:49,447
driving them forward into the trap.

885
01:35:50,326 --> 01:35:54,228
That is my artillery.
Rather neatly concealed, don't you think?

886
01:35:54,497 --> 01:35:57,330
My gunners greet them with a full salute.

887
01:35:57,834 --> 01:36:00,325
And finally, in come my horsemen.

888
01:36:00,937 --> 01:36:04,065
This is, gentlemen,
my household cavalry...

889
01:36:04,407 --> 01:36:08,002
similar to that which guards
the person of your Queen Empress.

890
01:36:08,111 --> 01:36:11,444
Each man is mounted
on a valiant charger...

891
01:36:12,348 --> 01:36:14,782
and eager to slay for his <i>guru.</i>

892
01:36:14,851 --> 01:36:19,083
The honor of the thunder in
and slaughter of your army falls to them.

893
01:36:23,526 --> 01:36:28,054
I see it in your faces.
Who is this ugly little savage...

894
01:36:28,131 --> 01:36:31,589
to snarl so boldly at the British lion?

895
01:36:33,236 --> 01:36:37,730
Prime generals, friends, are not made
of jeweled swords and moustache wax.

896
01:36:38,775 --> 01:36:41,437
They're made of what is there,
and what is here.

897
01:36:41,511 --> 01:36:43,502
- You're mad.
- Mad?

898
01:36:46,849 --> 01:36:50,285
Hannibal was mad. Caesar was mad.

899
01:36:50,353 --> 01:36:53,413
And Napoleon
surely was the maddest of the lot.

900
01:36:53,923 --> 01:36:55,356
Ever since time began...

901
01:36:55,425 --> 01:36:59,191
they've called mad all the great soldiers
in this world. Mad?

902
01:36:59,929 --> 01:37:03,592
We shall see what wisdom lies
within my madness...

903
01:37:03,666 --> 01:37:07,067
for this is but the spring freshet
that precedes the flood.

904
01:37:07,136 --> 01:37:10,469
From here we roll on,
from village to town...

905
01:37:10,974 --> 01:37:15,502
from town to mighty city,
ever mounting, ever widening...

906
01:37:15,645 --> 01:37:19,274
until at last my wave engulfs all India.

907
01:37:22,185 --> 01:37:24,676
My soldiers! March!

908
01:37:31,261 --> 01:37:35,322
- Toad Face, if you make a move...
- Stop, or I'll slit his throat.

909
01:37:38,468 --> 01:37:40,060
Obey me, my son!

910
01:37:46,576 --> 01:37:50,535
Beloved <i>guru,</i> our men will not move
if it is to cost your life.

911
01:37:50,613 --> 01:37:53,480
What is my life
to the life of our cause? Go!

912
01:37:54,083 --> 01:37:56,950
- No! They will not let you die.
- Go!

913
01:38:06,629 --> 01:38:08,722
No, you don't. We need you.

914
01:38:12,201 --> 01:38:13,259
Wait a minute.

915
01:38:13,336 --> 01:38:18,035
You have sworn as soldiers,
if need be, to die for your faith...

916
01:38:18,908 --> 01:38:21,433
which is your country, your England.

917
01:38:22,745 --> 01:38:25,236
India is my country and my faith...

918
01:38:25,481 --> 01:38:28,006
and I can die for my faith and my country...

919
01:38:28,084 --> 01:38:30,211
as readily as you for yours.

920
01:38:31,387 --> 01:38:32,718
Go, <i>chota.</i>

921
01:38:34,590 --> 01:38:37,024
India, farewell.

922
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:03,546
You have warned the English.
You must die.

923
01:39:05,888 --> 01:39:10,416
Our <i>guru</i> has given his life
for our cause. We must not fail him now!

924
01:39:14,230 --> 01:39:17,393
We must get up there and warn
the Scotties before they're trapped.

925
01:39:17,467 --> 01:39:20,027
We may not warn them,
but we've got to try.

926
01:39:30,546 --> 01:39:32,537
Come on, mates. Let's go.

927
01:39:50,500 --> 01:39:53,594
- Good work, soldier!
- Thank you, <i>sahib.</i>

928
01:40:51,427 --> 01:40:52,519
Look.

929
01:40:53,696 --> 01:40:56,256
Before I have your faces
tied to bags of hot ashes...

930
01:40:56,332 --> 01:41:00,598
I want you to watch as though
you were rajahs at an Imperial Durbar...

931
01:41:00,770 --> 01:41:03,762
while your comrades
are slain to the last man.

932
01:41:22,158 --> 01:41:26,288
<i>Bonnie Charlie's now awa '</i>

933
01:41:26,362 --> 01:41:30,423
<i>Safely owre the friendly main</i>

934
01:41:30,933 --> 01:41:34,892
<i>Mony a heart will break in twa</i>

935
01:41:35,171 --> 01:41:39,005
<i>Should he no' come back again</i>

936
01:41:39,242 --> 01:41:41,802
You see, soldiering isn't all war,
Mr. Journalist.

937
01:41:44,247 --> 01:41:48,183
<i>Will ye no' come back again</i>

938
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,421
They're coming in.

939
01:42:01,664 --> 01:42:05,191
- The Colonel's got to know.
- Yes.

940
01:45:03,245 --> 01:45:05,213
Trumpeter, sound off.

941
01:45:16,992 --> 01:45:18,516
Shoot him down!

942
01:45:35,511 --> 01:45:38,674
- You take the left flank, I'll take the right.
- Yes, sir.

943
01:45:52,228 --> 01:45:54,560
They're getting away! Fire!

944
01:46:01,604 --> 01:46:02,901
Good work, bugler.

945
01:46:03,506 --> 01:46:04,768
Fire! Charge!

946
01:46:17,620 --> 01:46:19,383
Cut their heads off.

947
01:46:37,473 --> 01:46:41,307
- Poor old Din. What a mate.
- Mac, look! Here they come!

948
01:46:59,862 --> 01:47:02,456
- Come on!
- Hit them again!

949
01:47:39,435 --> 01:47:40,902
Get them off!

950
01:48:38,861 --> 01:48:40,988
Speak to me, Bal.

951
01:48:45,668 --> 01:48:47,397
They've killed him!

952
01:48:49,538 --> 01:48:52,632
You'll pay for this.
I'll make you pay for this.

953
01:48:56,712 --> 01:48:59,943
Take that. And that!

954
01:49:13,162 --> 01:49:15,494
That's right. I don't trust you.

955
01:49:16,065 --> 01:49:19,057
Why, you dirty, scheming scum.

956
01:49:20,002 --> 01:49:21,367
You rotter.

957
01:50:15,024 --> 01:50:16,218
Charge!

958
01:50:51,460 --> 01:50:53,985
- Everything cleaned up, sir.
- Nice work, Mitchell.

959
01:50:54,063 --> 01:50:55,587
Thank you, sir.

960
01:51:31,333 --> 01:51:33,392
Firing party, halt.

961
01:51:35,737 --> 01:51:37,227
Inwards, turn!

962
01:51:38,974 --> 01:51:41,568
Fire three volleys in the air. Ready!

963
01:51:46,548 --> 01:51:49,278
Present. Fire!

964
01:51:52,821 --> 01:51:53,981
Ready!

965
01:51:56,191 --> 01:51:58,989
Present. Fire!

966
01:52:03,265 --> 01:52:07,099
- Very good, my boy.
- Thank you, Colonel.

967
01:52:07,369 --> 01:52:09,803
- Not half bad.
- Thank you, Colonel.

968
01:52:14,810 --> 01:52:17,005
Let's take a look to the men.

969
01:52:43,438 --> 01:52:45,030
Stand easy, men.

970
01:52:46,875 --> 01:52:50,072
We've all done enough soldiering
for one long day.

971
01:52:51,513 --> 01:52:55,449
You were fine today. Particularly fine.

972
01:52:56,151 --> 01:52:59,018
I'd sooner hear that from you, sir,
than get a blooming medal.

973
01:52:59,087 --> 01:53:01,021
Thank you, sir.

974
01:53:14,903 --> 01:53:17,838
Perhaps you'd take care of this for me, sir.

975
01:53:28,817 --> 01:53:33,550
And here's a man of whom the regiment
will always be proud.

976
01:53:37,793 --> 01:53:41,695
According to regulations,
he had no actual status as a soldier.

977
01:53:43,065 --> 01:53:46,796
But those who had the privilege
of serving with him today...

978
01:53:46,902 --> 01:53:50,269
know that if ever a man
deserved the name and rank of soldier...

979
01:53:50,339 --> 01:53:54,469
it was he. So I'm going to appoint him
a corporal in this regiment.

980
01:53:58,947 --> 01:54:03,646
His name will be written on the rolls
of our honored dead...

981
01:54:05,854 --> 01:54:07,446
and I...

982
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:12,482
Let me see that last part again,
will you, Mr. Kipling?

983
01:54:15,597 --> 01:54:17,064
Present arms!

984
01:54:32,214 --> 01:54:34,239
"So I'll meet 'im later on

985
01:54:34,850 --> 01:54:37,080
"At the place where 'e is gone

986
01:54:37,352 --> 01:54:40,014
"Where it's always
double drill and no canteen

987
01:54:41,323 --> 01:54:43,655
"He'll be squatting on the coals

988
01:54:44,059 --> 01:54:46,619
"Giving drink to poor damned souls

989
01:54:48,230 --> 01:54:51,131
"And I'll get a swig in Hell from Gunga Din

990
01:54:55,103 --> 01:54:58,334
"Yes, Din, Din, Din

991
01:55:00,008 --> 01:55:03,569
"You Lazarushian-leather Gunga Din.

992
01:55:05,647 --> 01:55:08,810
"Tho' I've belted you and flayed you

993
01:55:13,655 --> 01:55:16,055
"By the living God that made you

994
01:55:18,226 --> 01:55:22,219
"You're a better man than I am,
Gunga Din!"

995
01:55:42,451 --> 01:55:44,510
Forward turn!

996
01:55:46,755 --> 01:55:48,279
Straight march!

997
01:57:01,296 --> 01:57:02,456
