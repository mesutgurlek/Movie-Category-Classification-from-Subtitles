1
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:43,764
MAN: All ready here, sir. Crew standing by
and awaiting your word. Over.

2
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:01,365
Right. Over and out.

3
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,498
[SIREN WAILING]

4
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,837
MAN: Our man was brought down
at 2 a.m. this morning.

5
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:20,175
SHAEF, in their all-knowing wisdom,
didn't let us know until 10 a.m.

6
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:23,303
Damned idiots.
Damned idiots for not letting us know.

7
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:27,015
Double damned idiots
for ignoring our advice in the first place.

8
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:29,518
Anyway, here he is...

9
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,187
...in a town called Werfen...

10
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:35,983
...at the Schloss Adler,
the Castle of the Eagles.

11
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:39,820
And believe me, it's well-named,
because only an eagle can get to it.

12
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,866
Our job is to get inside there
and get him out as soon as possible...

13
00:04:45,034 --> 00:04:47,286
...before they can
get the information from him.

14
00:04:47,453 --> 00:04:50,163
How are you so sure that he's there, sir?

15
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,709
The Mosquito he was in
crash-landed only 10 miles away.

16
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:57,879
The Schloss Adler is the headquarters of the
German secret service in southern Bavaria.

17
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,257
Where else would they take him?

18
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:04,011
- How did the plane crash, sir?
- Through the most damnable ill luck.

19
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:07,347
We carried out a saturation raid
on Nuremberg last night.

20
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:11,518
There shouldn't have been a German fighter
within 100 miles of the Austrian border.

21
00:05:11,686 --> 00:05:14,229
A wandering Messerschmitt patrol
got him.

22
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,898
Anyway, that's not important.

23
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:21,611
What is important is that
we get him out before he talks.

24
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:25,699
Or I should say, you get him out.

25
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:28,035
What about paratroops, sir?

26
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:31,872
The Schloss Adler
is inaccessible and impregnable.

27
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:35,083
It would require a battalion
of paratroops to take it.

28
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,918
We haven't got the time.

29
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,796
Stealth and secrecy are our only hope...

30
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,717
...and you gentlemen are,
I trust, stealthy and secretive.

31
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:47,637
We realize of course that you've never
worked together before as a team...

32
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:52,142
...but you're familiar with one another,
except for Lieutenant Schaffer here.

33
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,770
You probably noticed
that Lieutenant Schaffer...

34
00:05:54,937 --> 00:05:57,898
...wears the shoulder flashes
of the American Ranger division.

35
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,442
I think that speaks for itself.

36
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:02,944
Major Smith will lead the group in.

37
00:06:03,112 --> 00:06:06,406
Now, you're all expert
at survival behind enemy lines.

38
00:06:06,616 --> 00:06:08,200
Smith, Lieutenant Schaffer...

39
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,620
...Sergeants Harrod and MacPherson
in their military capacities...

40
00:06:11,788 --> 00:06:14,915
...the rest of you in other duties.

41
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,334
You all speak fluent German.

42
00:06:17,502 --> 00:06:20,337
You've been trained
in different types of combat.

43
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,132
If anybody has a chance
of getting him out, you have.

44
00:06:24,342 --> 00:06:26,468
There is, of course, another way, sir.

45
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,971
A way with a 100 percent guarantee
of success.

46
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:34,893
Neither Admiral Rolland or I
claim to be omniscient or infallible.

47
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,437
Is there an alternative that we've missed?

48
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:41,983
Whistle up a pathfinder squadron
of Lancasters with 10-ton bombs.

49
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:45,821
I don't think anybody in that castle
would ever talk again.

50
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,824
Nor do I think that you grasp
the realities of the situation.

51
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,494
The captured man, General Carnaby,
is an American.

52
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:55,664
If we were to destroy him,
then I think General Eisenhower...

53
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:59,459
...might launch his second front against us
rather than against the Germans.

54
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:04,381
There are certain niceties to be observed
in our relationship with our allies.

55
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:10,846
Very well, then, gentlemen.
Ten o'clock tonight at the airfield.

56
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:14,349
- No more questions, I take it?
- Yes, sir.

57
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:18,186
Begging the colonel's pardon, sir.
What's all this about?

58
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,522
I mean, why is this man
so damned important?

59
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:22,524
- Why should...?
- That'll do, sergeant.

60
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,693
You have all the information you require.

61
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,696
I think if we're sending a man
to what may be his death...

62
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,198
...he has a right to know why.

63
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,492
It's painfully simple, sergeant.

64
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,204
General Carnaby is one
of the overall coordinators...

65
00:07:36,372 --> 00:07:38,748
...of planning for the second front.

66
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:43,044
He set out last night to meet
his opposite numbers in the Middle East...

67
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,006
...to finalize the plans
for the invasion of Europe.

68
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:49,092
The rendezvous with the Russians
was to have been in Crete.

69
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,053
Now, unfortunately, his plane
didn't get through.

70
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:57,809
Now, if the Germans can make him talk...

71
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,562
...it could mean no second front
this year.

72
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,900
- Do you understand, sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

73
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:08,778
- I'm sorry, sir.
TURNER: That's all right, sergeant. Forget it.

74
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:12,032
Now, if you have any more questions,
Major Smith will answer them.

75
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,284
That's all, gentlemen.

76
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:46,525
PILOT: Get them ready.
We're approaching the drop area.

77
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,527
Stand by!

78
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,004
Green on! Go!

79
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:40,198
Where's Harrod?

80
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:48,998
Well, last time I saw him, he was drifting
towards those trees over here.

81
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:56,673
All right. Spread out.

82
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,007
Let's go and find him.

83
00:12:27,329 --> 00:12:29,164
Major!

84
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:17,670
- His neck's broken.
- Damn it.

85
00:13:21,842 --> 00:13:25,220
Well, what do we do now?
Do we bury him or do we leave him here?

86
00:13:25,387 --> 00:13:28,890
We leave him here. The snow
will cover him in a couple of hours.

87
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:33,186
Get back and pick up the equipment.
I want to see if the radio's still working.

88
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:16,164
Well...

89
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,918
...the radio works all right. There's a barn
about a mile down the valley.

90
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,045
We'll use it to check our equipment.

91
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,839
- What about the people who live in it?
- There aren't any.

92
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:27,300
This is a high alpine pasture.

93
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,678
They bring the cattle up in May
and take them down in September.

94
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:33,806
The rest of the time,
the place is totally deserted.

95
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:36,434
Come on. Let's go.

96
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:13,721
Somehow, you know, this just isn't me.

97
00:16:13,889 --> 00:16:17,642
It's not any of us, Jock.
You're the cook. Cook...

98
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:22,897
...some hot food and some hot coffee,
and then call London on the radio.

99
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,692
Damn it. I left that codebook
in Sergeant Harrod's tunic.

100
00:16:25,859 --> 00:16:29,696
- I'll go and get it for you.
- No, it's all right. It's my own stupid fault.

101
00:16:29,863 --> 00:16:33,574
Sounds as if it's still blowing a blizzard.
Yeah.

102
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,327
Well, if I'm not back in an hour...

103
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,414
...signal me with a flare pistol
four times every five minutes.

104
00:16:39,581 --> 00:16:41,249
That should bring a blind man home.

105
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:43,835
Might also bring the best part
of a German regiment.

106
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:46,546
There's not a German within five miles.

107
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:49,132
Nobody leaves here until I come back.

108
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:52,468
- Jock, save me some coffee.
- It'll be cold by then.

109
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,431
They say that's an advantage.
You can't taste cold coffee.

110
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,152
[GUN CLICKS]

111
00:18:17,346 --> 00:18:18,638
WOMAN:
Halt.

112
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,390
Turn around.

113
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:32,318
You took your time getting here,
didn't you?

114
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,821
Things to attend to.

115
00:18:35,739 --> 00:18:37,365
- You enjoy your trip?
- Lovely.

116
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:39,659
I nearly froze to death
in that damn plane.

117
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:44,413
Why couldn't you have supplied some hot
water bottles or an electrically heated suit?

118
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:48,501
- I thought you loved me.
- I can't help what you think.

119
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,795
You managed to bring your gear.

120
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,964
Is that all the greeting I'm going to get?

121
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:57,426
I'm afraid so, for the time being.
My radio operator was killed in the drop.

122
00:18:57,594 --> 00:18:59,345
What happened?

123
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:01,639
Something struck him
in the back of the neck.

124
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:04,016
Either the haft of a knife
or the butt of a gun.

125
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:06,185
The skin was unbroken,
but badly discolored.

126
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,437
It means someone
broke his neck afterwards...

127
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,398
...to make it look like an accident.

128
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:14,402
Now listen, I'm taking the group at dawn
over the ridge into the next valley.

129
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:17,613
We'll stop in the woods until about 7.
Now, don't stumble into us.

130
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,367
As soon as it's dark,
we'll move into the village of Werfen.

131
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,412
In the village, there's a gasthaus
called Zum Wilden Hirsch.

132
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:27,373
Behind it and to the right,
there's a woodshed.

133
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:31,127
I'll meet you there
at exactly 8:00 tomorrow night.

134
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:35,339
- And after that, what?
- I'll let you know when the time comes.

135
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:36,883
Ah.

136
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,261
- I see you've come fully prepared.
- Never mind about that.

137
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:44,974
How do you know about all these things,
Zum Wilden Hirsch and the shed?

138
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:47,935
I'm entitled to know.

139
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,730
You're entitled to know nothing.

140
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:55,818
We've worked together for three years.
I'm a professional.

141
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:57,028
So am I.

142
00:19:57,446 --> 00:20:00,281
If I were the marrying kind, which I'm...

143
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,625
- I thought you were in a hurry.
- So I am.

144
00:20:10,792 --> 00:20:12,501
Aren't you?

145
00:21:19,903 --> 00:21:21,779
SCHAFFER:
What kept you?

146
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,824
Well, I was very lucky.

147
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:29,620
I ran into this fabulous blond.
She was lying on a snowdrift.

148
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,205
Does she have a friend?

149
00:21:31,373 --> 00:21:33,791
No, I'm afraid you're out of luck.

150
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:38,838
- Thanks for waiting up for me, anyway.
- No problem.

151
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,894
Lieutenant, why don't you go to sleep?

152
00:21:54,062 --> 00:21:56,439
It'll be dawn in a couple of hours.

01:25:25,995 --> 01:25:28,372
In your own idiom, you're a punk...

619
01:25:29,374 --> 01:25:31,875
...and a pretty second-rate punk at that.

620
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:37,256
- lf I might have some explanation...
- In good time, colonel. All in good time.

621
01:25:37,423 --> 01:25:40,759
I was about to say scopolamine
would have little effect on our friend...

622
01:25:40,927 --> 01:25:45,013
...except to prove he's not General Carnaby,
but a certain Cartwright Jones...

623
01:25:45,181 --> 01:25:47,516
...an American actor
impersonating General Carnaby.

624
01:25:47,684 --> 01:25:50,644
- Who are you?
- Just a passer-by, as you might say.

625
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:53,397
In fact, I think the drug
would probably work better...

626
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:56,859
...on our friends at the end of the table.
They're our real enemies.

627
01:25:57,026 --> 01:25:59,862
- Don't listen to him, general. It's a bluff!
- Keep quiet!

628
01:26:03,199 --> 01:26:06,869
Allow me to introduce myself.
Major Johann Schmidt.

629
01:26:07,036 --> 01:26:10,080
SS Military Intelligence, Stuttgart.

630
01:26:10,248 --> 01:26:12,332
- Can you prove that?
- Certainly, colonel.

631
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:15,919
Before I do, I wonder if you'd be
good enough to call one of your guards.

632
01:26:16,087 --> 01:26:20,591
I don't fancy talking and keeping my eye
on these people at the same time.

633
01:26:23,052 --> 01:26:24,970
Strange.

634
01:26:26,890 --> 01:26:29,433
I seem to remember...

635
01:26:29,601 --> 01:26:32,811
...that the cathedral was
on the other side of the square.

636
01:26:35,773 --> 01:26:37,524
Well...

637
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,778
Of course, I might be mistaken.
It's been a long time.

638
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:46,408
Oh, no, major.
I could have made a mistake.

639
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:49,912
I haven't been to Düsseldorf
for three years.

640
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:52,247
It's very easy to forget.

641
01:26:52,415 --> 01:26:55,500
Yes. It's very easy.

642
01:26:59,964 --> 01:27:03,133
Fräulein, you seem to be
a little bit distracted.

643
01:27:04,385 --> 01:27:06,845
- Is anything wrong?
- No. No, it's nothing.

644
01:27:07,013 --> 01:27:10,807
Just a slight headache.
I've had a long day traveling.

645
01:27:11,809 --> 01:27:14,311
Oh, yes, of course. And here I am...

646
01:27:14,479 --> 01:27:18,440
...I'm talking about silly things
like Düsseldorf.

647
01:27:19,317 --> 01:27:21,485
- You will forgive me?
- Of course.

648
01:27:21,653 --> 01:27:23,153
Thank you. I tell you what.

649
01:27:23,321 --> 01:27:27,824
We will have one more schnapps together
and then I'll see you to your quarters.

650
01:27:27,992 --> 01:27:29,493
- Thank you.
- Fräulein!

651
01:27:34,832 --> 01:27:38,168
Well, now that we're all comfortable,
the first order of business...

652
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:42,381
...is to find out exactly who everybody is
and what they're doing here.

653
01:27:42,632 --> 01:27:45,008
Now, first the lieutenant.

654
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:46,677
He's an assassin...

655
01:27:46,844 --> 01:27:51,265
...a member of the American
intelligence organization known as OSS.

656
01:27:51,432 --> 01:27:55,560
His job was to shoot you, Colonel Kramer,
and you, General Rosemeyer.

657
01:27:55,728 --> 01:27:59,189
Now, General Carnaby's mission
was twofold:

658
01:27:59,357 --> 01:28:01,233
First, to allow himself to be tortured...

659
01:28:01,401 --> 01:28:03,986
...into giving you the wrong plans
for the second front.

660
01:28:04,153 --> 01:28:05,988
And secondly, to afford the British...

661
01:28:06,155 --> 01:28:09,324
...a perfect excuse to send in
a team of experts to rescue him.

662
01:28:09,492 --> 01:28:12,286
Which brings us
to our three friends here...

663
01:28:12,453 --> 01:28:14,871
...and the cleverest phase
of the British operation.

664
01:28:15,039 --> 01:28:17,416
- They are, of course, members of Ml6.
- That's a lie.

665
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:19,543
Let him finish!

666
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:22,546
Their job was to penetrate
the German High Command...

667
01:28:22,714 --> 01:28:26,550
...instead of the real
Thomas, Berkeley and Christiansen...

668
01:28:26,718 --> 01:28:28,677
...who worked for us in London...

669
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:32,472
...and were discovered and captured
by the British about a month ago.

670
01:28:32,640 --> 01:28:34,850
That's another lie.
You can't prove any of this.

671
01:28:35,018 --> 01:28:36,601
Can't I?

672
01:28:37,228 --> 01:28:39,730
Any denials, lieutenant?

673
01:28:43,234 --> 01:28:46,403
Now, General Carnaby,
perhaps you'd be good enough...

674
01:28:46,571 --> 01:28:49,698
...to give us your real name, rank
and serial number.

675
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:02,627
Cartwright Jones, corporal, U.S. Army...

676
01:29:02,920 --> 01:29:06,798
...RA 123-025-3964.

677
01:29:06,966 --> 01:29:08,592
SCHMIDT:
Thank you.

678
01:29:09,010 --> 01:29:12,763
Having successfully substituted
these three British agents for our men...

679
01:29:12,930 --> 01:29:15,349
...what was the next phase
of the British plan?

680
01:29:15,516 --> 01:29:17,934
To penetrate the German High Command.

681
01:29:18,102 --> 01:29:20,395
How? Simple.

682
01:29:20,563 --> 01:29:24,733
Stage a fake air crash
with a fake American general on board...

683
01:29:24,901 --> 01:29:27,444
...send in special agents
to effect his release...

684
01:29:27,612 --> 01:29:29,738
...be sure that they fail in their mission...

685
01:29:29,906 --> 01:29:32,115
...and these men
would be taken to Berlin...

686
01:29:32,283 --> 01:29:35,118
...where they would be
right in the heart of the Wehrmacht.

687
01:29:35,286 --> 01:29:38,789
And you, Major Schmidt,
what were your orders on this mission?

688
01:29:39,457 --> 01:29:42,250
To lead them in and make
my own way out through Switzerland.

689
01:29:42,919 --> 01:29:46,880
- But it... It's incredible.
- Yes.

690
01:29:47,048 --> 01:29:49,299
But to the British, very, very simple.

691
01:29:49,842 --> 01:29:52,636
You were going to give us
some proof of who you are.

692
01:29:52,804 --> 01:29:54,638
SCHMIDT:
Certainly, general.

693
01:29:54,847 --> 01:29:58,141
The proof is in three parts.
First, if I'm not who I say I am...

694
01:29:58,309 --> 01:30:01,561
...what am I doing here?
What can I possibly hope to gain?

695
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:05,816
The rescue of an impostor,
the exposure of three spies. Who to?

696
01:30:05,983 --> 01:30:08,652
To the very people
they're supposed to be working for.

697
01:30:08,820 --> 01:30:11,113
I have nothing to gain.

698
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:15,283
Also, if these people
are what they say they are...

699
01:30:15,451 --> 01:30:19,162
...they would know the name
of our top agent in Whitehall.

700
01:30:19,330 --> 01:30:21,623
- Yes.
- So why don't we ask them?

701
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:29,548
They should know the man
who sent them on this mission.

702
01:30:29,715 --> 01:30:31,842
CHRISTIANSEN:
We all work through contacts.

703
01:30:32,009 --> 01:30:34,219
It wasn't necessary
or safe for us to know...

704
01:30:34,387 --> 01:30:36,304
...where our orders were coming from.

705
01:30:36,472 --> 01:30:40,517
Then I should be in the same boat as you,
but I know his name and you don't.

706
01:30:43,813 --> 01:30:45,188
Secondly, colonel, you have...

707
01:30:45,356 --> 01:30:48,150
...one of the most powerful
radio transmitters in Europe.

708
01:30:48,317 --> 01:30:51,027
Put a radio telephone call through...

709
01:30:51,195 --> 01:30:53,864
...to Field Marshal Kesselring's
headquarters in Italy...

710
01:30:54,031 --> 01:30:58,577
...and ask for his Chief of Intelligence,
a Major Wilhelm Wilner.

711
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:09,045

There's Colonel Kramer on the telephone
from the Schloss Adler in Bavaria.

714
01:31:16,345 --> 01:31:18,472
He says it's very urgent.

- Can you describe him?
- That will not be necessary.

719
01:31:27,565 --> 01:31:29,566
Ask him to show you his right forearm.

720

- May I see your right forearm?
- Certainly.

721

WILNER [OVER PHONE]: There are two
parallel scars, about three centimeters apart.

722
01:31:40,036 --> 01:31:41,286
The scars are there.

723
01:31:42,079 --> 01:31:43,747
Ask how did he get them.

724
01:31:44,332 --> 01:31:46,541
- How did you get those?
- I was born with them.

725
01:31:46,709 --> 01:31:48,084
KRAMER:
He says he was born with them.

726
01:31:48,461 --> 01:31:51,296
That is right. Then tell him he's a traitor.

As you know, the real Thomas,

01:32:13,945 --> 01:32:16,696
...while working
for British counterespionage...

735
01:32:16,864 --> 01:32:21,368
...were responsible for setting up an
excellent chain of agents throughout Britain.

736
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:24,246
Now, if these men are
who they claim to be...

737
01:32:24,413 --> 01:32:25,914
...it would be reasonable...

738
01:32:26,082 --> 01:32:29,292
...to expect them to be able
to write down a list of those agents.

739
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:32,754
You could then compare their lists
with the genuine one...

It's your name, colonel.

He'd suspected you and the others
for some time.

991
02:29:52,775 --> 02:29:56,069
He brought me and Mary back from Italy
because we were the only two...

...in his department that he could trust,
yourself included.

He asked you to choose a leader
for this expedition.

994
02:30:03,160 --> 02:30:05,829
You chose me because you knew
from German intelligence...

995
02:30:05,997 --> 02:30:09,207
...that I was a double agent.

996

Admiral Rolland knew I was not.

02:30:12,920 --> 02:30:15,755
But for you, I was the perfect choice.

- No guesswork, colonel.

is sufficient evidence.

Go on.

1002
02:30:34,066 --> 02:30:37,736
Mary was brought on the mission without
your knowledge because I needed her...

1003
02:30:37,903 --> 02:30:41,156
...to get me into the castle.
The lieutenant, being an American...

1004
02:30:41,323 --> 02:30:43,324
...had no possible connection with Ml6...

1005

I could trust.

- Not at all.

to the plane himself, didn't he?

that you had that gun, didn't he?
