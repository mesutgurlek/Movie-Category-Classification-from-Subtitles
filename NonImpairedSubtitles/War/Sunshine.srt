Be quiet.

313
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:17,648
Why should I be quiet
in my own house?

314
00:27:17,716 --> 00:27:20,913
Come to your senses
and forbid them to do it!

315
00:27:20,986 --> 00:27:23,511
It's no use. Our children
aren't interested...

in warnings from their grandfather
nor even in God's curse.

317
00:27:26,558 --> 00:27:29,288
She'll be interested
in my curse.

318
00:27:29,361 --> 00:27:32,159
I curse her. May her womb dry up.
May she never have children!

319
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:34,164
- No!
- What do you want from me?

320
00:27:34,232 --> 00:27:36,666
I want the mother of my children
to understand my children!

321
00:27:36,735 --> 00:27:39,363
- She is not your child!
- Stop it!

322

If you can't keep your mouth shut,
I'll shut it!

323
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,701
Maybe you can talk to your

Ah, yes, your new favorite.
A most promising young judge.

My pleasure, Minister.

368
00:31:29,301 --> 00:31:31,701
I trust you've seen
this morning's newspaper?

369
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:33,863
Two members of the Prime Minister's
office have been accused...

370
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:36,533
of selling information
to property speculators.

371
00:31:36,608 --> 00:31:38,701
I can assure you it's
a filthy political move...

372
00:31:38,777 --> 00:31:41,337
fabricated entirely
by the opposition.

373
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:44,780
From what I've read, there
are three points in the case...

374
00:31:44,849 --> 00:31:46,783
which I find intriguing.

375
00:31:46,851 --> 00:31:48,785
Do you think
the gentlemen are guilty?

376
00:31:48,853 --> 00:31:50,821
I beg your pardon,
but if surprise evidence...

377
00:31:50,889 --> 00:31:54,882
was to turn up in the courtroom,
then nothing can be done except...

378
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:59,021
- Except?
- Severe sentences for all of them.

379
00:31:59,097 --> 00:32:01,258
What would you advise?

380
00:32:01,333 --> 00:32:04,200
The case could be
sent back to the prosecution...

381
00:32:04,269 --> 00:32:09,172
for further investigation to ensure
that no detail is overlooked.

382
00:32:09,241 --> 00:32:13,507

a time-consuming process.

You're a bright young man.

Five judges are about to retire.

to bring down someone high up.

392

bring down the entire government!

at the very core of the monarchy?

No, at the core there is a liberal,
fair-minded ruler...

who's able to keep peace among
many different kinds of people.

396
00:32:52,217 --> 00:32:55,812
- The Emperor has wisdom behind him.
- And a lifetime of oppression!

- Tell that to his victims.

00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:54,544
L...
I don't think I could.

466
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:58,851
Why not? You're young, ambitious.
Your hands are clean.

467
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:01,187
The people think you're clever.
You're living proof the monarchy...

468
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:04,023
is enlightened and supportive
of middle-class values.

469
00:38:04,095 --> 00:38:07,496
Frankly, it's a challenge
that's tailor-made for you.

470
00:38:07,565 --> 00:38:09,897
<i>[Narrator] My grandfather</i>
<i>was fiercely tempted...</i>

471
00:38:09,968 --> 00:38:12,198
<i>by this invitation</i>
<i>to join the ruling class.</i>

472
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:14,329

that refined,

influential gentlemen
appreciate you.

474
00:38:16,441 --> 00:38:18,375
Excuse me, Mother,
but thanks to the influence...

475
00:38:18,443 --> 00:38:20,434
of these "refined gentlemen,"
there has never been...

476
00:38:20,511 --> 00:38:23,241
such rampant corruption,
such miserable conditions...

477
00:38:23,314 --> 00:38:25,544
for working people than there is
at this very moment.

478
00:38:25,617 --> 00:38:27,551
You're exaggerating,
Gustave.

479
00:38:27,619 --> 00:38:29,553
Exaggerate? You come with me
to my clinic, Mother.

480
00:38:29,621 --> 00:38:32,715
You see tubercular, gout-ridden,
undernourished workers...

481
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:35,020
and their emaciated,
half-starved children.

482
00:38:35,093 --> 00:38:37,061
Come with me on house calls
to dank, musty rooms...

483
00:38:37,128 --> 00:38:39,221
where people
sleep three to a bed.

484
00:38:39,297 --> 00:38:42,027
Old people sleeping
on kitchen floors.

485
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,660
Ask bakers why people steal crumbs
from the floors of their wagons.

486
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:47,671
Why people <i>line up</i>
to buy stale bread!

487
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:50,264
You're describing conditions
in the poorest slums.

488
00:38:50,341 --> 00:38:52,832
You can't expect the government
to change things overnight.

489
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,844
- Why not?
- I would be shamed if my husband...

490
00:38:54,912 --> 00:38:57,005
were to stand for office
in such a corrupt government.

491
00:38:57,081 --> 00:38:59,345
Wouldn't you all
be ashamed of him?

492
00:38:59,417 --> 00:39:03,353
Honestly. Wouldn't you be
ashamed of yourself?

493
00:39:03,421 --> 00:39:05,855
All I said is that I've been asked
to stand for election. Nothing more.

494
00:39:05,923 --> 00:39:09,222
They're getting desperate.
The monarchy's become so weak,

495
00:39:09,293 --> 00:39:11,591
they'll grab anyone that
makes them look respectable.

496
00:39:11,663 --> 00:39:13,688
We are proud
you've had this offer, son.

497
00:39:13,765 --> 00:39:16,461
It proves that your education
has been of value,

<i>that you do your work well,</i>
<i>that you're respected.</i>

If ever we expect

505
00:39:39,457 --> 00:39:41,823
we need to know who we are.

506
00:39:41,893 --> 00:39:43,485

My family is against

- And why is that?
- They're not happy for me...

in politics, if people
like you and I don't?

517
00:40:18,896 --> 00:40:21,956
I prefer to remain
an independent judge.

518
00:40:22,033 --> 00:40:25,867
Independent? Independent
from what, from the world?

519
00:40:25,937 --> 00:40:28,701
All right, let it be.
I won't try to argue with you.

520
00:40:28,773 --> 00:40:30,707
Just have a look
at this list, please.

521
00:40:30,775 --> 00:40:32,709
The chief of police
just sent it over,

522
00:40:32,777 --> 00:40:37,305
names of members
of Socialist organizations.

523
00:40:39,150 --> 00:40:42,642
Excellency,
I'm obliged to point out...

524
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,813
that my brother's name
is on this list.

525
00:40:44,889 --> 00:40:46,823
Yes, it is.

526
00:40:46,891 --> 00:40:49,655
Would you explain to me
why rich, educated Jews...

527
00:40:49,727 --> 00:40:52,662
are behind every attempt
to overthrow this government?

528
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:57,895
Jews become doctors, lawyers,
teachers. What more do they want?

529
00:40:59,570 --> 00:41:02,095
I'm sorry I'm late.

530
00:41:02,173 --> 00:41:04,664
What's wrong?

531
00:41:04,742 --> 00:41:08,838
There's information that
you're part of a conspiracy...

532
00:41:08,913 --> 00:41:11,677
intent on overthrowing
the monarchy.

533
00:41:11,749 --> 00:41:14,616
What conspiracy?
What information?

534
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:17,620
- Oh, God.
<i>- [Ignatz] Well?</i>

535
00:41:17,688 --> 00:41:20,179
What? I've no part
in any conspiracy.

536
00:41:20,258 --> 00:41:22,249
- Don't lie to me, Gustave.
<i>- [Valerie] Keep your voice down.</i>

537
00:41:22,326 --> 00:41:24,692
- Mama and Papa will hear.
- Maybe they should be invited in.

538
00:41:24,762 --> 00:41:26,696
Their house might be searched.

539
00:41:26,764 --> 00:41:28,698
Their precious son, the doctor,
might be arrested.

540
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:30,700
The only thing keeping
you and your friends...

541
00:41:30,768 --> 00:41:33,168
out of prison
is liberal tolerance.

542
00:41:33,237 --> 00:41:36,536
"Liberal tolerance"?
Is that some sort of joke?

543
00:41:36,607 --> 00:41:38,871
You mean tolerance
for misery and hunger...

544
00:41:38,943 --> 00:41:41,377
for watching hundreds of thousands
of workers sink into poverty.

545
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:43,606
<i>Is this the kind</i>
<i>of speech you make at rallies?</i>

546
00:41:43,681 --> 00:41:45,615
Where do you get the nerve
to go against the very empire...

547
00:41:45,683 --> 00:41:47,617
that allows a Jew like you
to become a doctor!

548
00:41:47,685 --> 00:41:49,812
- Or a Jew like you.
- Exactly!

549
00:41:49,887 --> 00:41:53,823
Without the Emperor, you'd be
selling tonic like grandfather.

550
00:41:53,891 --> 00:41:57,156
You only believe in this fairy-tale
Emperor out of pure greed.

551
00:41:57,228 --> 00:41:59,162
I believe in a strong
judicial system...

552
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,994
and the right to assimilate
into the country I love!

553
00:42:02,066 --> 00:42:06,298
You'll never be accepted here.
You'll be treated with suspicion.

554
00:42:06,370 --> 00:42:10,272
<i>- Only the workers will accept you.</i>
- Yes, the Workers' Movement.

555
00:42:10,341 --> 00:42:11,933
You share a common enemy:
Exploitation.

556
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:15,069
<i>You dream of a common goal:</i>
<i>Revolution.</i>

557
00:42:15,146 --> 00:42:18,115
A new Jewish prophet who wants
to destroy everything!

558
00:42:18,182 --> 00:42:20,582
No, I want freedom.
For freedom, one must fight.

559
00:42:20,651 --> 00:42:23,518
- Let the blood flow?
- Yes, please, let it flow!

560
00:42:23,588 --> 00:42:25,647
- That is my wish!
<i>- [Ignatz] You know what I wish?</i>

561
00:42:25,723 --> 00:42:27,657
I wish God would rip that tongue
out of your mouth...

562
00:42:27,725 --> 00:42:29,784
so you would stop spewing
your sick, vile...

563
00:42:29,861 --> 00:42:32,056
Ignatz! No.

564
00:42:33,364 --> 00:42:35,855
Perfect.
You put a curse on me.

565
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:38,925
<i>You're better off silenced by</i>
<i>my curse than by a prison sentence.</i>

566
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:42,632
Stop it! You're like two rabbis
fighting over the Torah.

567
00:42:42,707 --> 00:42:44,641
Your husband's in love with success.

568
00:42:44,709 --> 00:42:46,643
Yes, and I lust after power.

569
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:48,804
You're a loyal subject.

570
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:51,246
That's what makes you happy.
You love the Emperor.

571
00:42:51,315 --> 00:42:54,216
Exactly.
You're on his side, aren't you?

572
00:42:54,285 --> 00:42:57,846
- What do you mean, "on his side"?
<i>- You two looking at each other.</i>

573
00:42:57,922 --> 00:43:00,550
- You think I'm blind?
- Are you completely insane?

574
00:43:00,625 --> 00:43:04,994
Stop it, both of you!
Do you know what I want?

575
00:43:05,062 --> 00:43:07,257
I don't want to be accepted
by people in power...

576
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:10,164
or by people who feel oppressed.

577
00:43:10,234 --> 00:43:12,168
You want to know
what I do want?

578
00:43:12,236 --> 00:43:14,170
I want to be proud
of my own language.

579
00:43:14,238 --> 00:43:19,175
I want to look out of the window and
see a country that I know and love.

580
00:43:19,243 --> 00:43:23,976
I want to grow like a wildflower,
where it belongs.

581
00:43:24,048 --> 00:43:27,017

for us at the Civic Club.

- Two hundred thousand.

Please, Mr. Brenner, you must
realize that every single man...

on the national team comes
from the Officers' Club.

Two hundred and fifty thousand
is our limit.

It's a perfect tradeoff.

1074

You get money and full support,
and we get a national champion.

No. My answer is no.
You need a team for this sport.

1078
01:18:22,511 --> 01:18:24,479
That's a group of men
with a common goal.

1079
01:18:24,546 --> 01:18:26,480
You have more in common
with them than with us?

Yes, we're a team.

And if we manage to buy
a few of your teammates?

But the next dance
is definitely ours, darling.

So you'll have
to be content with me.

Who?

1091
01:19:01,917 --> 01:19:05,148
The little man over there,
Mr. Brenner, and his Jewish friends.

1092
01:19:05,220 --> 01:19:07,347
They think money's
the answer to everything.

1093
01:19:07,423 --> 01:19:12,190
Mr. Brenner specifically or
Mr. Brenner and his Jewish friends?

They're all the same.

Nothing.
Just let me love you.

In your opinion, who is
the best coach in this country?

1105

The best man to prepare the team
for the Olympic games?

1106
01:20:04,713 --> 01:20:08,740
- Baron Margittay.
- Exactly what I want to hear.

1107
01:20:08,817 --> 01:20:13,345
Next question:
Who on the team can win for us?

1108
01:20:13,422 --> 01:20:17,119
- That's a difficult question, sir.
- But you have an answer.

of drawing your attention
to an indisputable fact.

This is the Officers' Club.

The laws don't apply to me. I'm

- I know all this.
<i>- I'm Roman Catholic.</i>

I'm an Olympic champion.

1436
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,634
I was also awarded
the Signum Laudis.

1437
01:42:41,702 --> 01:42:45,502
That's four reasons.
Well done.

1438
01:42:45,573 --> 01:42:47,700
You'll probably be promoted
to general.

1439
01:42:47,775 --> 01:42:50,437

1440

<i>- nothing more.</i>
- Go ahead, fence.

1441

There is no law stopping you,
but you won't fence with us.

1442
01:42:58,319 --> 01:43:02,483
You do know you would never have
become the Olympic champion...

1443
01:43:02,556 --> 01:43:06,890
were it not for the fact that
two of the judges were Jews.

1444
01:43:13,934 --> 01:43:18,928
These people are either
criminal or insane or both.

1445

I beg you, please,
let's move away from here.

1446
01:43:21,742 --> 01:43:24,302
If you want to, we can all go.
Your whole family:

1447
01:43:24,378 --> 01:43:26,846
Hannah, Istvan,
your mother.

1448
01:43:26,914 --> 01:43:29,178
We owe it to our children
to get out while we still can.

1449

I beg you, please.

1450

We can get through this
if you just keep on loving me.

1451
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:35,856
Hannah can't go
and leave her parents behind.

1452
01:43:35,923 --> 01:43:38,118
When will Hannah
get out of my bed?

1453
01:43:38,192 --> 01:43:40,660
- It's you who are in her bed.
- You wanted this too.

1454
01:43:40,728 --> 01:43:42,889
I certainly did not.
You started this. You wanted it.

Adam, me or this country?

If I'm going to choose,

1457
01:43:48,269 --> 01:43:51,033
I'm gonna stay with Hannah, who's
only exempt because she's my wife.

1458
01:43:51,105 --> 01:43:53,039
- Give this up.
- I won't give you up...

1459
01:43:53,107 --> 01:43:55,735
because I can't give you up because
that's what love does to people.

1460
01:43:55,809 --> 01:43:58,369
Evidently not to you.
I don't care about your family.

1461
01:43:58,445 --> 01:44:00,379
- You want me to kill my family?
- Yes, yes, kill them.

1462
01:44:00,447 --> 01:44:03,177
- I wish Istvan were dead.
- Jesus, you're monstrous.

1463
01:44:03,250 --> 01:44:05,616
I can't see
any other way out.

1464

by Hungarian civil servants:

Village mayors, local police,
railway officials.

02:21:13,111 --> 02:21:15,579
because they've read
their precious Talmud.

1958
02:21:15,647 --> 02:21:18,639
They're also planning to
take over the Workers' Movement.

1959
02:21:18,717 --> 02:21:22,585
Not a one of them has ever
so much as held a hammer.

1960
02:21:22,654 --> 02:21:27,455
Look at these hands!
These are worker's hands!

1961
02:21:27,526 --> 02:21:31,326
These people are only with us
out of revenge against the fascists,

1962
02:21:31,396 --> 02:21:35,230
not because they believe
in the Workers' Movement.

1963
02:21:36,368 --> 02:21:38,302
So, okay.

1964
02:21:38,370 --> 02:21:42,306
They say there are Anti-Semites
in this country.

1965
02:21:42,374 --> 02:21:43,642
Whose fault is that? Who's got the
best jobs? Jews. Here we go again.

1966
02:21:43,642 --> 02:21:47,134
Whose fault is that? Who's got the
best jobs? Jews. Here we go again.

1967
02:21:47,212 --> 02:21:50,579
I believe more Jews came back
from the camps than were sent.

1968
02:21:50,649 --> 02:21:54,983
Your assignment is to drag
these bastards in...

1969
02:21:55,053 --> 02:21:57,487
and indict
every one of them.

1970
02:21:57,556 --> 02:22:01,856
This won't be easy. You've got a
close, personal connection in this.

1971
02:22:01,927 --> 02:22:05,829
- Me?
- Andor Knorr, your beloved boss.

1972
02:22:05,897 --> 02:22:07,694
He's one of the heads
of the whole thing.

1973
02:22:07,766 --> 02:22:10,758
- That's impossible.
- We have film...

1974
02:22:10,836 --> 02:22:15,102
of Knorr speaking
with Israeli agents!

1975
02:22:17,175 --> 02:22:19,109
Read this.

1976
02:22:19,177 --> 02:22:21,270
Here.

1977
02:22:21,346 --> 02:22:25,442
You yourself could be highly suspect
because of being so close to Knorr.

1978
02:22:25,517 --> 02:22:28,077
Keep Jews off your team.

Tell me what
they're accusing me of.

1981
02:23:04,322 --> 02:23:06,483
A Zionist conspiracy.

1982
02:23:06,558 --> 02:23:08,549
Intention to overthrow
the Socialist state.

1983

[Softly]
Are they crazy?

1984
02:23:11,062 --> 02:23:14,054
I have been ordered
to interrogate you.

1985
02:23:16,001 --> 02:23:18,435
Let's get started.

1986
02:23:20,138 --> 02:23:21,332
Thank you.

1987
02:23:27,679 --> 02:23:31,115
When did you first enlist in
the conspiracy against the State?

1988
02:23:31,182 --> 02:23:34,640
Never. I've never enlisted in
any conspiracy against the State.

1989
02:23:34,719 --> 02:23:37,779
We have filmed proof of your
meeting with Zionist agents...

1990
02:23:37,856 --> 02:23:39,790
<i>in the museum garden</i>
<i>on the fifth of this month.</i>

None.

I've never met
with Zionist agents.

I don't even know
any Zionist agents.

1997
02:23:55,373 --> 02:23:58,137
- Not even before the war?
- No.

1998
02:23:58,209 --> 02:24:00,200
What about at your orphanage?

1999
02:24:01,713 --> 02:24:05,479
<i>Have you ever heard</i>
<i>the word "Zionism"?</i>

2000
02:24:05,550 --> 02:24:08,781
- Of course I have.
- Where?

2001
02:24:08,853 --> 02:24:12,914
At the orphanage,
I had a friend.

2002
02:24:14,626 --> 02:24:18,062
He and some of his friends
wanted to emigrate to Palestine.

2003
02:24:18,129 --> 02:24:22,896
I joined the Young
Socialists instead.

2004
02:24:25,036 --> 02:24:27,197
So...

2005
02:24:27,272 --> 02:24:31,732
why didn't you go to Israel
if your best friend was with them?

2006
02:24:33,144 --> 02:24:38,912
Because they were religious,
and I was not.

2007
02:24:38,984 --> 02:24:40,918
If there hadn't been
the Young Socialists,

2008
02:24:40,986 --> 02:24:43,921
<i>I'd probably be living</i>
<i>on a kibbutz in Israel now.</i>

2009
02:24:43,989 --> 02:24:46,787
- Well, don't you see?
- I didn't have to be ashamed...

2010
02:24:46,858 --> 02:24:49,918
of my origins, and I didn't have
to be proud of them either!

2011
02:24:49,995 --> 02:24:51,758
What happened to you
during the war?

2012
02:24:51,830 --> 02:24:55,732
- I was caught and put in Auschwitz.
- Any Zionists there?

2013
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:59,258
Sors.

2014
02:24:59,337 --> 02:25:01,567
- Enough of this nonsense.
- No, it's not nonsense.

2015
02:25:01,639 --> 02:25:03,607
You better understand,
this is not a game.

2016
02:25:03,675 --> 02:25:06,940
I'm asking you questions on orders
from people way up there.

2017
02:25:07,012 --> 02:25:09,708
As an officer of this department,
you are a suspect.

2018
02:25:09,781 --> 02:25:12,909
You're under arrest.
If you don't answer thoroughly,

2019
02:25:12,984 --> 02:25:15,544
things are going to get tougher,
and you know what I'm saying.

2020
02:25:15,620 --> 02:25:17,554
There's a lot of evidence here
that singles you out...

2021
02:25:17,622 --> 02:25:20,022
as one of the leaders
of this conspiracy.

Don't hold your breath.

2024

Why are Jews involved
in everything?

2025
02:25:26,464 --> 02:25:28,398
Wasn't Auschwitz
enough for you?

2026
02:25:28,466 --> 02:25:31,060
Even you will never
be free of Auschwitz.

2027
02:25:31,136 --> 02:25:33,400
Auschwitz
was our baptism.

2028
02:25:33,471 --> 02:25:36,269
There is something
you must know, though.

2029
02:25:36,341 --> 02:25:38,741
Surviving Auschwitz doesn't
make a man better or greater.

2030
02:25:38,810 --> 02:25:43,577
It's just burnt into your brain!
It can never be erased!

so difficult again, Nana.

of a bitch slapped around!

2044
02:26:56,588 --> 02:26:59,887
The man's gone through a lot of
suffering. He survived Auschwitz.

2045
02:26:59,958 --> 02:27:03,416
Strange how the suffering
of Jews seems to touch you.

2046
02:27:03,495 --> 02:27:06,089
Don't you know that
other people suffered?

2047
02:27:06,164 --> 02:27:09,691
Ordinary people were shipped off
to the front to fight...

2048
02:27:09,767 --> 02:27:11,826
or else they stayed at home
and fought on their own doorsteps.

2049
02:27:11,903 --> 02:27:14,303
Don't these kind of people
matter to you too?

2050
02:27:14,372 --> 02:27:16,533
With all due respect,
after surviving Auschwitz,

2051
02:27:16,608 --> 02:27:18,542
I don't think a beating
is going to break him.

2052
02:27:18,610 --> 02:27:22,171
It's not the quality of the man.
It's the quality of the beating.

2053
02:27:22,247 --> 02:27:24,579
I'm not sure Knorr's guilt can ever
be proven without a confession.

2054
02:27:24,649 --> 02:27:27,516
- Then get one out of him!
- He calls himself a Communist.

2055
02:27:27,585 --> 02:27:30,713
Are you a policeman
or a fucking Boy Scout?

2056
02:27:30,788 --> 02:27:32,722
If he keeps saying
he's a Communist,

2057
02:27:32,790 --> 02:27:37,056
make him understand that his
confession's important to the Party.

2058
02:27:37,128 --> 02:27:40,393
Our number one priority
is to let the world know...

2059
02:27:40,465 --> 02:27:43,730
the Workers' Movement is not
under Zionism's thumb,

2060
02:27:43,801 --> 02:27:48,067
and Marx and Engels
are not Jewish prophets.

2061
02:27:48,139 --> 02:27:52,735
By the way, you don't know how lucky
you are that your uncle died.

2062

"Reunion of veterans

Another question: Who does your
grandmother take pictures for?

2066
02:28:09,260 --> 02:28:12,525
My grandmother takes pictures for
herself. She's just a photographer.

"A photographer"? You're surrounded

Do you have
a girlfriend?

2069

If you do,
have her investigated.

- Leave before it's too late.
- That's why you called?

2108
02:30:59,163 --> 02:31:04,430
I love you, Carole.
I'm begging you to come with me.

2109
02:31:04,502 --> 02:31:08,632
Where? Into the bushes to fuck
with my skirt over my head?

2110
02:31:10,375 --> 02:31:12,309
I was wrong
about you.

2111
02:31:12,377 --> 02:31:14,607
I was wrong to love you.
I thought you were different.

2112
02:31:14,679 --> 02:31:18,615
I need someone safe, someone calm
and strong, not neurotic like you.

2113
02:31:18,683 --> 02:31:22,084
Do you think you're in danger
because of me?

2114
02:31:25,123 --> 02:31:29,651
So... it's over?

2115
02:31:29,727 --> 02:31:31,718
Yes.

2116
02:31:31,796 --> 02:31:34,026
So how do you want
to end it?

2117
02:31:34,098 --> 02:31:37,261
It's not that complicated.

2118
02:31:37,335 --> 02:31:40,327
Stand up, walk out the door
and close it behind you.

2119
02:31:42,874 --> 02:31:45,104

Fine.

02:31:54,018 --> 02:31:57,249
I'm pregnant, and I don't know
who the father is.

- Either him or you.

2125
02:32:01,759 --> 02:32:04,853
What are you going to do?

2126
02:32:04,929 --> 02:32:07,022
I'm taking care of it.

2127
02:32:10,802 --> 02:32:13,464
There's a man under the window.

2128
02:32:13,538 --> 02:32:17,065
I think I've seen him before.

2129

Go to hell.

2130
02:32:43,835 --> 02:32:47,601
I left your grandfather once.
I fell in love with another man.

2131
02:32:47,672 --> 02:32:49,765
Your grandfather and I
hadn't been getting along.

2132
02:32:49,841 --> 02:32:52,401
He wasn't the sort of person
I hoped he'd be.

2133
02:32:52,477 --> 02:32:57,779
The other man was...
passionate, a wonderful lover.

2134
02:32:57,849 --> 02:32:59,783
That is important, darling.

2135
02:32:59,851 --> 02:33:03,810
He gave me an old medallion
engraved with: "I love you."

2136
02:33:03,888 --> 02:33:09,087
When your grandfather got in trouble
with the Communists, I came back.

2137
02:33:09,160 --> 02:33:14,029
You must try to find joy

<i>[Ivan] In the spring,</i>

2141

2145
02:33:40,825 --> 02:33:44,761

<i>I was asked to identify his body.</i>

2146
02:33:44,829 --> 02:33:47,423
<i>I learned that Knorr</i>

Andor talked
about you fondly...

Would you mind saying
a few words at the funeral?

Andor Knorr... one of your murderers
has come to your grave...

2162
02:34:59,337 --> 02:35:01,430
to say good-bye to you.

2163
02:35:01,505 --> 02:35:03,598
I was your first interrogator,

2164
02:35:03,674 --> 02:35:08,168
someone who you trained
to defend the cause without mercy.

2165
02:35:08,245 --> 02:35:12,011
We believed we were going to make
the world a better place for people,

2166
02:35:12,083 --> 02:35:14,745
but, instead,
we made it so much worse.

2167
02:35:14,819 --> 02:35:19,552
As servants of power-hungry
criminals, we became criminals.

2168
02:35:19,624 --> 02:35:25,529
Our politicians lied to the people
by saying they were doing good.

2169
02:35:25,596 --> 02:35:30,761
The people lied to the politicians
by saying that they believed them.

2170
02:35:30,835 --> 02:35:34,771
I'm not just saying
good-bye to you.

2171
02:35:34,839 --> 02:35:38,366
I'm also saying
good-bye to myself.

2172
02:35:38,442 --> 02:35:43,903
I stood by and watched my father
be... tortured and executed,

2173
02:35:43,981 --> 02:35:45,915
and I did nothing.

2174
02:35:45,983 --> 02:35:48,577
Then I watched them
do the same thing to you,

2175
02:35:48,653 --> 02:35:52,089
and I did nothing.

2176
02:35:52,156 --> 02:35:54,420
I make a promise,
here at your graveside,

2177
02:35:54,492 --> 02:36:00,260
to do everything to punish those
who have turned ideals into crimes.

2178
02:36:02,166 --> 02:36:05,932
Just after the war, I found a framed
quotation on my father's desk.

2179
02:36:06,003 --> 02:36:10,030
It said: "We are afraid
to see clearly...

2180
02:36:10,107 --> 02:36:13,099
and of being seen clearly."

2181
02:36:13,177 --> 02:36:16,704
At the time, I couldn't
understand what it meant,

2182
02:36:16,781 --> 02:36:18,715
but now
I understand perfectly...

2183
02:36:18,783 --> 02:36:23,880
because this is precisely
what happened to us.

2184
02:36:23,954 --> 02:36:26,115
Andor Knorr...

2185
02:36:26,190 --> 02:36:28,715
my friend...

2186
02:36:28,793 --> 02:36:30,784
good-bye.

2187
02:36:37,134 --> 02:36:39,068
Why are you crying?
Are you in mourning?

2188
02:36:39,136 --> 02:36:41,070
[Rosner]
I'm warning you.

2189
02:36:41,138 --> 02:36:44,403
You said things we tolerate from no one,
not even if times have changed.

2190
02:36:44,475 --> 02:36:47,239
- Fuck you.
- Do you know who you're talking to?

2191
02:36:47,311 --> 02:36:49,677
- Who's that?
- Another incident like this,

2192
02:36:49,747 --> 02:36:52,944
- and you'll be off the force.
- Say the word. I'm happy to quit.

2193
02:36:53,017 --> 02:36:56,248
Do you know the difference
between a worker and a Jew?

2194
02:36:56,320 --> 02:36:59,756
If a worker doesn't like something,
he leaves without saying good-bye.

2195
02:36:59,824 --> 02:37:01,758
AJew says good-bye,
but he stays.

2196
02:37:01,826 --> 02:37:04,090

go fuck yourself.
