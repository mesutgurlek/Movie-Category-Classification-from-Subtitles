<i>Surinam 1921</i>

3
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:09,805
Okay boys, let it go.
- Not yet.

4
00:01:10,014 --> 00:01:13,930
Do you want to cross the entire ocean?
- Fine with me.

5
00:01:14,139 --> 00:01:17,681
What would you do in Holland?
- Study.

6
00:01:18,014 --> 00:01:23,140
That 'll be the day.
Now let go, you little monkeys.

7
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:28,308
Stop now or l' ll sink your boat.

8
00:01:37,682 --> 00:01:39,681
Let's row.

9
00:01:41,973 --> 00:01:43,181
l' ll swim.

10
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,432
That's too far.
- So what?

11
00:01:51,098 --> 00:01:54,223
Waldemar, come back!
Are you crazy?

12
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:57,180
He's crazy.

13
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:23,017
Dad!

14
00:02:23,804 --> 00:02:26,847
Waldemar!
- Where are you going?

15
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:30,180
Brasil
-Why?

16
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:33,763
Can't make a living here.
- What about us?

17
00:02:34,555 --> 00:02:39,014
You'll manage.
You're my son.

18
00:03:41,141 --> 00:03:44,017
Where's mom?
-Inside.

19
00:04:03,805 --> 00:04:06,682
Daddy is gone.

20
00:04:07,307 --> 00:04:09,557
You swam in the river again!

21
00:04:10,724 --> 00:04:12,972
Many kids have drowned there.

22
00:04:13,181 --> 00:04:18,223
l' ll never drown, mamma.
The water is my friend.

23
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:27,390
My ocean swimmer.

24
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,514
<i>Seven years later.</i>

25
00:04:42,764 --> 00:04:45,932
I will miss you all .
-l' ll miss you too.

26
00:04:47,057 --> 00:04:50,016
Waldemar, this is
mother's dearest wish.

27
00:04:50,348 --> 00:04:53,807
Yes, but five years is a long time.

28
00:04:55,391 --> 00:04:57,658
Don't secretly marry my sister.

29
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:59,391
- She has to say yes first.

30
00:04:59,599 --> 00:05:02,099
l' ll be back for the wedding.

31
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:04,808
You can come back after graduating.

32
00:05:05,017 --> 00:05:06,430
I won't let you down.

33
00:05:06,637 --> 00:05:11,472
If you screw up, we'll
canceI your allowance.

34
00:05:14,971 --> 00:05:17,889
Don't open it before
you get on board.

35
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:28,015
Don't forget us!
And say hello to our cousin.

<i>Goedereede, Holland.</i>

37
00:06:12,474 --> 00:06:15,475
Mom! It 's finished.

38
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:25,725
Why does daddy go to church twice?

39
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,722
He wants to be close
to God twice as often.

40
00:06:57,848 --> 00:07:01,556
''My God...''

41
00:07:16,098 --> 00:07:19,349
It 's a disgrace, on
the day of our dear Lord.

42
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:22,598
Our councilman isn't
blessed with such a wife.

43
00:07:22,889 --> 00:07:25,139
Why don't they wave back?

44
00:07:25,348 --> 00:07:27,058
They're not allowed.
- Says who?

45
00:07:27,474 --> 00:07:31,140
Says God.
- Are you allowed?

46
00:07:31,307 --> 00:07:33,974
I can do anything I want.

47
00:07:58,931 --> 00:08:01,513
Why are you so quiet?

48
00:08:02,513 --> 00:08:04,473
We're not quiet at all .

49
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:08,015
It 's so quiet I can
hear my own thoughts.

50
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,682
Do you want me to
read from the bible ?

51
00:08:11,932 --> 00:08:14,764
l' d rather not.
The meat is getting cold .

52
00:08:14,972 --> 00:08:17,309
I know a passage...

53
00:08:17,310 --> 00:08:20,348
about a wife who has
to obey her husband.

54
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:23,182
Do you want me to shut up?
- Yes!

55
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:48,849
Now it's quiet again.

56
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:54,641
We're not quiet at all .
It's a riot here. Isn't it, Willem?

57
00:08:54,974 --> 00:08:56,849
One big riot.

58
00:08:57,141 --> 00:08:59,474
Or shall I talk to the water jug?

59
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:02,349
Hey, jug, did you lose your tongue?

60
00:09:02,557 --> 00:09:05,725
I didn't lose my tongue.
I swallowed daddy's.

61
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:09,013
That way I can talk even more.

62
00:09:09,263 --> 00:09:13,514
Mamma is funny.
- Daddy doesn't think so.

63
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:22,430
Can't you ever be normal
Look who's talking.

64
00:09:34,432 --> 00:09:38,640
''My God, how I love you!
Tonight in the shed...''

65
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:29,387
<i>The Hague</i>

66
00:10:31,013 --> 00:10:32,555
You have to go back.

67
00:10:32,763 --> 00:10:38,098
I can't. The love is gone.
- That happens in every marriage.

68
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,347
What if every woman ran away?
-l' m not 'every woman'.

69
00:10:41,514 --> 00:10:44,388
We warned you for Willem.
- Yes you did.

70
00:10:44,597 --> 00:10:47,036
He abducted you
from that monastery!

71
00:10:47,037 --> 00:10:49,263
Those nuns still pray for you.

72
00:10:49,473 --> 00:10:52,516
Keeps them off the street.
-lmpertinent as ever.

73
00:10:52,723 --> 00:10:57,722
Mom, please, I need a home.

74
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,806
You can't stay here.

75
00:11:01,681 --> 00:11:04,046
And we can't lend you any money.

76
00:11:04,947 --> 00:11:06,264
Why don't you say something?

77
00:11:06,515 --> 00:11:08,640
Why should l
You do most of the talking.

78
00:11:08,848 --> 00:11:10,723
No, Rika does.

79
00:11:11,099 --> 00:11:12,973
She's just like you.

80
00:11:13,391 --> 00:11:15,348
Mom, it's only temporary.

81
00:11:15,723 --> 00:11:21,099
We warned her enough.
She has to take care of herseIf now.

82
00:11:30,682 --> 00:11:32,999
Rika, wait!

83
00:11:34,599 --> 00:11:36,134
What will you do now?

84
00:11:36,335 --> 00:11:39,557
Find a home for me and my children.

85
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:04,889
- David Millar.
-Waldemar Nods.

86
00:12:05,098 --> 00:12:06,935
When I arrived, all I had

87
00:12:06,936 --> 00:12:09,305
was a stuffed crocodile
and a bow and arrow.

88
00:12:09,514 --> 00:12:11,054
Quite a sight, wasn't it?

89
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:13,765
In Holland you're
always quite a sight.

90
00:12:14,015 --> 00:12:18,639
- Do you know who I am?
- Yes, you're my cousin.

91
00:12:18,847 --> 00:12:22,882
That's what they say.
Actually, l' m your half-brother.

92
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,764
- My half-brother?
-A bastard son of your father.

93
00:12:29,431 --> 00:12:32,431
So having all his
mistresses pays off.

94
00:12:34,307 --> 00:12:38,015
Why did you come here?

95
00:12:38,556 --> 00:12:41,682
To fulfill my dream
of a better future.

96
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:44,263
So you're a dreamer.

97
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,889
But you'll find out.
-Find out what?

98
00:12:47,264 --> 00:12:50,348
How it is over here.
-Is it that bad?

99
00:12:50,598 --> 00:12:54,432
Nothing but poverty
for people like us.

100
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:03,224
You're late.
-The traffic was busy.

101
00:13:05,058 --> 00:13:07,225
The children have gone to bed.

102
00:13:07,516 --> 00:13:09,551
Show your cousin the guest room.

103
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:11,696
l'll heat up your dinners.

104
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:30,681
What will you study?
-Business administration.

105
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,558
Not aircraft construction?

106
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,890
- Not everybody is
flying high, Christine.

107
00:13:35,099 --> 00:13:36,641
Is that what you do?

108
00:13:36,848 --> 00:13:40,514
l'm financial director at
Royal Dutch Airlines.

109
00:13:46,807 --> 00:13:51,974
Your Surinam certificates
won't be sufficient here.

110
00:13:52,515 --> 00:13:55,175
You can't apply for our University.

111
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:58,139
You have to take
the entrance course.

112
00:13:58,473 --> 00:13:59,848
The entrance course?

113
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,974
Eighty percent of your kind faiIs .

114
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:23,807
The question he often raised was
whether a mathematical axiom...

115
00:14:24,182 --> 00:14:27,391
... could be applied to
philosophical matters.

116
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:37,639
- Black Peter, Black Peter!
- Shut up! That's not a reaI one.

117
00:15:11,889 --> 00:15:14,765
Where can he go?
He has nobody else.

118
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:17,223
You said he'd be gone soon!

119
00:15:17,431 --> 00:15:21,099
Send him away!
-I can't. He's my cousin.

120
00:15:21,515 --> 00:15:26,264
Cousin, brother... it doesn't matter.
I want him out of here.

121
00:15:43,016 --> 00:15:45,083
How lovely , Bertha!

122
00:15:45,084 --> 00:15:48,391
It's so great you're all here.

123
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,721
Do we have to live here?

124
00:15:54,096 --> 00:15:56,680
I want to go home.

125
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:16,432
So the women are working
while the men are playing?

126
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:39,432
How dare you ruin that ball ?

127
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,390
Everything in my
garden is my property.

128
00:17:02,683 --> 00:17:05,932
Have you gone mad?
Remove that immediately !

129
00:17:06,433 --> 00:17:10,225
Everything in your garden
is your property, isn't it?

130
00:17:17,722 --> 00:17:19,389
What are you looking at?

131
00:17:19,722 --> 00:17:23,304
l'm looking for this address.
They have a room for rent.

132
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:26,597
That's me.
But we're busy moving in.

133
00:17:30,389 --> 00:17:34,849
l'm sorry. Maybe I can
come back some other time.

134
00:17:40,057 --> 00:17:42,806
Or is the room no
longer available ?

135
00:17:43,264 --> 00:17:44,305
No.

136
00:17:44,806 --> 00:17:46,973
You can say yes.

137
00:17:47,181 --> 00:17:50,556
Why would I say yes
if it's not yet rented?

138
00:18:07,641 --> 00:18:12,431
It 's bed and board. And I also
do the cleaning and the laundry.

139
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,099
Come here, kids.

140
00:18:18,557 --> 00:18:21,349
Would you mind if Mr.
Nods became our boarder?

141
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,683
What's a boarder?
-You'll find out.

142
00:18:26,266 --> 00:18:29,641
My name is Waldemar.
Nice to meet you.

143
00:18:30,182 --> 00:18:33,142
Do you wash yourself?
- Better than you.

144
00:18:35,388 --> 00:18:38,221
Is daddy living all alone now?

145
00:18:38,555 --> 00:18:41,031
He's got his job and
Jans takes care of him.

146
00:18:41,032 --> 00:18:43,306
He can't be very lonely .

147
00:18:43,930 --> 00:18:46,805
This is your new school
With the priests.

148
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:50,097
Not you, you're going
to the girls school.

149
00:18:50,306 --> 00:18:53,431
Let me guess...
With nuns?

150
00:18:53,847 --> 00:18:55,181
Bye.

151
00:19:03,889 --> 00:19:05,514
Come in.

152
00:19:12,015 --> 00:19:14,557
Here's your supper.
-Thank you.

153
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:55,721
Do you like your room?
-It 's very nice.

154
00:19:56,555 --> 00:19:59,346
Children not too noisy?
-Not at all .

155
00:20:00,264 --> 00:20:04,472
Food alright?
- Couldn't be better.

156
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:11,264
We hardly see you.
What do you do during the day?

157
00:20:11,472 --> 00:20:15,097
I study, or I go to the beach.

158
00:20:17,098 --> 00:20:20,348
How about joining us
for dinner tomorrow?

159
00:20:20,724 --> 00:20:23,639
I don't want to bother anybody.

160
00:20:29,681 --> 00:20:33,472
In Surinam it doesn't
rain as often as here.

161
00:20:33,764 --> 00:20:36,557
But when it rains,
it rains really hard.

162
00:20:36,764 --> 00:20:39,140
We call it sibibusi.

163
00:20:41,056 --> 00:20:44,849
That's when the snakes come from
the soil to swim in the puddles.

164
00:20:45,098 --> 00:20:47,099
Do you know what we
always used to do?

165
00:20:47,348 --> 00:20:48,932
Well?

166
00:21:47,514 --> 00:21:51,890
- Don't you like potatoes?
- In Surinam we always eat rice.

167
00:21:52,098 --> 00:21:53,848
Rice?

168
00:22:06,348 --> 00:22:09,432
I heard you're living
together with a black one.

169
00:22:09,724 --> 00:22:11,930
So what?
-It 's my house.

170
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:15,389
- The rent gets paid, doesn't it?
- Everybody's talking about it.

171
00:22:15,639 --> 00:22:19,766
- I hadn't noticed.
- It happens behind your back.

172
00:22:20,098 --> 00:22:24,099
I don't care about everything
that happens behind my back.

173
00:22:24,516 --> 00:22:26,850
I don't want his kind here.

174
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:30,391
Mr. Nods is a decent man.
He goes to college.

175
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:33,600
And he happens to be my boarder.

176
00:22:47,347 --> 00:22:49,388
I don't want this crap.

177
00:22:49,764 --> 00:22:51,889
You could at least try.

178
00:22:52,222 --> 00:22:55,222
I said I don't want this crap!

179
00:22:55,638 --> 00:22:58,973
Wim, don't be so rude!

180
00:23:04,141 --> 00:23:07,181
Wim, what's the matter?

181
00:23:07,765 --> 00:23:09,806
I miss dad.

182
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:13,265
But you'll visit him for Christmas.

183
00:23:13,681 --> 00:23:18,307
He was so sad when we left him.

184
00:23:19,098 --> 00:23:21,855
It 's all very sad.

185
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,931
It's a pity it has to be this way.

186
00:23:27,015 --> 00:23:28,223
Yes.

187
00:23:42,724 --> 00:23:45,308
I bought you something.

188
00:23:45,724 --> 00:23:47,558
For me?

189
00:23:47,974 --> 00:23:50,307
A Christmas present.

190
00:23:51,224 --> 00:23:54,350
I thought... You love music so much.

191
00:24:28,431 --> 00:24:30,514
It's beautiful

192
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:35,681
Wouldn't you like to stay a while ?

193
00:24:36,014 --> 00:24:39,598
The house is so quiet
without the children.

194
00:24:44,723 --> 00:24:49,140
You should get out more.
You're always in the house.

195
00:24:51,141 --> 00:24:53,473
I never know where to go.

196
00:24:54,056 --> 00:24:56,890
Or who to visit.

197
00:25:20,472 --> 00:25:23,305
I really missed this.

198
00:25:23,972 --> 00:25:26,223
Me too.

199
00:26:17,056 --> 00:26:19,264
Mrs. van de Lans.

200
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:29,391
I couldn't stand it in the house.

201
00:26:30,058 --> 00:26:34,350
Try and find another room.
Your presence creates tension.

202
00:26:34,557 --> 00:26:38,433
For the kids?
- No, for me.

203
00:26:39,391 --> 00:26:42,663
- I thought you needed the money.

204
00:26:42,664 --> 00:26:46,430
I'll take another tenant.
A woman.

205
00:26:47,056 --> 00:26:51,639
l'm sorry about your present.
l'll give it back to you.

206
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,098
Mrs. van der Lans?

207
00:26:55,306 --> 00:26:57,264
You can call me Rika.

208
00:26:57,515 --> 00:27:01,515
Rika...
Shall we do something fun?

209
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,305
- It's snowing.
- Yes.

210
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:09,390
I only know this from pictures.

211
00:28:17,931 --> 00:28:22,556
You can't join us.
- Dirty nigger!

212
00:28:27,099 --> 00:28:28,972
Come on, throw!

213
00:28:36,431 --> 00:28:38,223
Bullseye!

214
00:29:35,472 --> 00:29:37,847
Don't you miss home?

215
00:29:38,306 --> 00:29:40,514
Not right now.

216
00:29:42,014 --> 00:29:44,723
And when you're not in my bed?

217
00:29:45,391 --> 00:29:50,265
I miss the sun.
And the river.

218
00:29:52,223 --> 00:29:54,974
No people ?

219
00:29:55,723 --> 00:30:01,598
My mother. But she's dead.

220
00:30:02,223 --> 00:30:04,974
And Hilda...

221
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:09,015
Hilda?
Your fiancé?

222
00:30:09,431 --> 00:30:13,224
No, she's my sister.
The eldest.

223
00:30:13,974 --> 00:30:16,764
My younger sister is named Lilly.

224
00:30:18,348 --> 00:30:22,765
Do you have sisters?
- Plenty of them.

225
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,107
And brothers too.

226
00:30:25,608 --> 00:30:28,891
But besides Marcel I
haven't seen them in years.

227
00:30:29,641 --> 00:30:31,808
Why not?

228
00:30:32,392 --> 00:30:35,724
They banned me when
I married Willem.

229
00:30:38,183 --> 00:30:40,975
Don't you miss Willem?

230
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,805
Not right now.

231
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:58,514
Can I have jam?

232
00:31:16,598 --> 00:31:24,181
- Mom, are you alright?
- Yes, l'm fine.

233
00:31:46,224 --> 00:31:51,016
How long?
About eight weeks.

234
00:31:51,307 --> 00:31:53,850
Have you got the money?

235
00:32:01,142 --> 00:32:04,805
Well , let's get this over with.

236
00:32:27,932 --> 00:32:30,641
You will have to lie down.

237
00:32:36,723 --> 00:32:39,807
A letter for you.
From Surinam.

238
00:32:51,432 --> 00:32:53,765
- Damn.
- Bad news?

239
00:32:54,266 --> 00:32:56,266
He doesn't want a divorce.

240
00:32:56,807 --> 00:32:58,889
Does it matter?

241
00:32:59,264 --> 00:33:03,098
Yes, Waldemar.
It matters a lot.

242
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:11,891
Wedding,
Hilda Nods and Jo Herdigein.

243
00:33:15,267 --> 00:33:19,224
<i>May 1929</i>

244
00:33:37,013 --> 00:33:39,305
Have you got a girlfriend?

245
00:33:39,889 --> 00:33:42,639
Why are you asking?

246
00:33:43,389 --> 00:33:45,974
Just because.

247
00:33:46,515 --> 00:33:49,099
Just because....

248
00:33:49,598 --> 00:33:54,806
A boy in my class said
something about men and women.

249
00:33:55,889 --> 00:34:00,181
About what they need.
- Need?

250
00:34:00,682 --> 00:34:04,432
Yes, to...

251
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:08,016
You know...

252
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:11,557
I understand.

253
00:34:14,057 --> 00:34:16,974
So do you have a girlfriend?

254
00:34:18,307 --> 00:34:20,639
No.

255
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:28,205
Wim!

256
00:34:33,006 --> 00:34:40,016
Hi Bertha, hi Henkie.
Everything alright?

257
00:34:53,264 --> 00:34:55,847
This hiding is driving me crazy.

258
00:34:56,847 --> 00:34:58,681
I love you.

259
00:34:59,431 --> 00:35:02,265
I don't care if the
whole world knows it.

260
00:35:03,597 --> 00:35:06,140
And they will.

261
00:35:06,557 --> 00:35:09,599
I'm pregnant.

262
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:17,223
Since when?
- Four months.

263
00:35:19,098 --> 00:35:21,390
Four months?

264
00:35:23,307 --> 00:35:27,432
What were you thinking?
This dumbo won't notice?

265
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,307
Of course I didn't.
I was scared.

266
00:35:35,390 --> 00:35:39,558
I even wanted to get rid of it, but...
- Get rid of it?

267
00:35:40,055 --> 00:35:43,307
Our child?

268
00:35:44,806 --> 00:35:49,265
I don't know. What are
we getting ourselves into?

269
00:35:49,849 --> 00:35:53,558
If they find out that we...

270
00:35:54,224 --> 00:35:56,641
I get it.
- No, you don't get it.

271
00:35:56,850 --> 00:36:01,349
Yes I do, Rika.
You're just like everybody else.

272
00:36:12,222 --> 00:36:15,097
Can I stay here for a while ?

273
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,763
I told you.
Nothing but poverty.

274
00:36:21,164 --> 00:36:23,164
<i>September 1929</i>

275
00:36:23,264 --> 00:36:26,222
Let's go for a swim.

276
00:36:27,515 --> 00:36:30,141
Why don't you join them for a swim?

277
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,183
I don't feel like it.

278
00:36:33,847 --> 00:36:37,015
Because you're too fat?

279
00:37:02,181 --> 00:37:03,890
Don't tell mom.

280
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:45,431
I don't see them, do you?
- No.

281
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:57,389
Wim, Jan!
Are you upstairs?

282
00:38:05,264 --> 00:38:07,390
Everybody runs away...

283
00:38:08,056 --> 00:38:10,390
I beg your pardon?

284
00:38:14,973 --> 00:38:17,640
My kids are not the only ones...

285
00:38:18,474 --> 00:38:20,807
I don't understand what you mean.

286
00:38:32,348 --> 00:38:35,308
Mom is a damn traitor.

287
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:45,516
...where the children are.
That's good to hear.

288
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:55,389
We talked to your husband.
The children are with him.

289
00:39:14,682 --> 00:39:19,098
I'm looking for Waldemar Nods.
Do you know where I can find him?

290
00:39:19,598 --> 00:39:23,349
Waldemar is taking his
entrance exam today.

291
00:39:25,264 --> 00:39:28,474
Oh, yes.
- Should I give him a message?

292
00:39:31,432 --> 00:39:37,973
Yes, from Rika. Tell
him I hope he'll pass.

Dear Wim, I feel sad about
you and Jan running away.

294

I am not angry with you.
I just hope you'll be back soon.

Whose is it?

296
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:35,557
Do you know you'll lose
everything, if I want to?

297
00:40:35,849 --> 00:40:38,765
No allowance. No children.
Do you realize?

298
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:43,681
If you only came to rub
it in, you'd better leave.

299
00:40:44,015 --> 00:40:46,723
No, that was not my intention.

300
00:40:48,389 --> 00:40:51,724
This is something
Wim didn't mention.

301

They offered me a job.
In Soerabaja.

303
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:04,389
It 's a beatiful place.
Also by the sea.

304
00:41:04,722 --> 00:41:08,681
I beg you...
Please join me.

305
00:41:09,473 --> 00:41:14,849
I don't want to continue like this.
I want to keep the children together.

306
00:41:15,224 --> 00:41:17,558
Our children.

307

Let's try again.
Far away from this misery.

Yes, that too...

310
00:41:36,181 --> 00:41:39,680
And you can bring your child .

311
00:41:40,055 --> 00:41:42,680
I'm willing to forgive you.

312
00:41:42,972 --> 00:41:47,014
I will legitimate your child
and raise it like my own.

Yes.

I'm going to destroy you, you slut.

00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:33,599
I'm going to destroy you
to the ground!

323
00:42:35,224 --> 00:42:37,724
Don't touch her.

324
00:42:50,433 --> 00:42:53,930
I love you so much.
Please don't leave me.

325
00:42:56,764 --> 00:43:01,222
Think! Blacks are drifters.
What if he goes back?

326
00:43:01,639 --> 00:43:05,348
- I will raise the kids by myself.
- You will lose them all.

327
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,848
What?
- He already has Wim and Jan.

328
00:43:08,056 --> 00:43:10,806
He will claim the other
two and I can't blame him.

329
00:43:11,056 --> 00:43:12,643
No, he can't do that.

330
00:43:12,644 --> 00:43:15,516
You can still give up this child.

331
00:43:15,766 --> 00:43:17,974
I can arrange a way out.

332
00:43:18,183 --> 00:43:20,847
There is no way out.
- Willem is mad as hell .

333
00:43:21,139 --> 00:43:24,015
I am their mother!
He can't do this to me.

334
00:43:24,224 --> 00:43:26,015
Look at what you did to him.

335
00:43:26,265 --> 00:43:30,181
He started it, with Jans.
With the maid.

336
00:43:30,515 --> 00:43:34,349
I have to find a lawyer.
He won't get them.

337
00:43:34,557 --> 00:43:37,890
I need some money.
- I can't help you anymore.

338
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:42,015
I will stop paying the rent.
- No Marcel, please!

339
00:43:42,224 --> 00:43:46,806
You have no one to blame but yourseIf .
- You can't. Not now!

340
00:43:56,265 --> 00:43:58,100
What's the matter with mom?

341
00:43:58,516 --> 00:44:02,600
She's upset because Wim
and Jan won't come back.

342
00:44:06,266 --> 00:44:07,766
You passed.

343
00:44:08,016 --> 00:44:10,392
Now you can go to university.

344
00:44:10,683 --> 00:44:13,097
As soon as you've paid
the tuition fee.

345
00:44:13,389 --> 00:44:16,389
- Tuition fee?
- 300 Guilders.

346
00:44:39,389 --> 00:44:41,181
It 's a boy.

347
00:44:45,473 --> 00:44:49,515
When they are babies,
they're still cute.

348
00:44:51,057 --> 00:44:55,265
- What shall we call him?
- Waldy.

349
00:45:10,807 --> 00:45:12,514
You're behind with the rent.

350
00:45:12,515 --> 00:45:15,066
Give me some time.
I just had a baby.

351
00:45:15,067 --> 00:45:17,432
With your decent boarder, I'll bet.

352
00:45:17,641 --> 00:45:19,474
That's none of your business.

353
00:45:19,683 --> 00:45:23,141
Exactly . Therefore,
I terminate the rent.

354
00:45:23,433 --> 00:45:27,266
You can't turn me and my
children out on the street.

355
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,725
I give you one more month.

356
00:45:31,141 --> 00:45:34,930
But only if you pay
the rent by tomorrow.

357
00:46:02,139 --> 00:46:06,431
Where did you get those?
- Bought them for Henkie and Bertha.

358
00:46:06,807 --> 00:46:11,848
We don't have money for balloons.
We can't even pay the rent.

359
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,763
Always be a king to
yourseIf , Waldemar.

360
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:57,222
No matter what you lose.

361
00:47:12,264 --> 00:47:14,347
A letter from court.

362
00:47:22,389 --> 00:47:27,723
- Is this the last evening?
- Yes, try to get over it.

363
00:47:30,182 --> 00:47:32,473
How am I supposed to do that?

364
00:47:34,765 --> 00:47:36,890
Write me whatever's on your mind.

365
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:39,306
If you don't I will feel so poor.

366
00:47:39,557 --> 00:47:42,057
But you're already poor.

367
00:47:42,266 --> 00:47:44,765
You make me feel rich.

368
00:47:50,181 --> 00:47:54,265
Bye, my dear sweethearts.

369
00:47:54,723 --> 00:47:58,658
Be good. Be kind to each other.

370
00:47:58,659 --> 00:48:03,100
Don't fight. And please write me.

371
00:48:03,392 --> 00:48:04,891
We have to go.

372
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,850
We'll see each other soon.

373
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:09,891
I'll write you.

374
00:48:10,225 --> 00:48:13,517
See you soon!

375
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:26,097
How can I tell them l'm only
allowed to see them once a year?

376
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:06,015
No vacancies.

377
00:49:15,014 --> 00:49:18,182
Sadly, that will be impossible.

378
00:50:00,224 --> 00:50:04,973
There are two things
a plant needs to grow:

379
00:50:05,472 --> 00:50:07,931
Sun and water.

380
00:50:09,890 --> 00:50:12,806
These are our rainy days.

381
00:50:16,265 --> 00:50:18,849
Hey little boy!

382
00:50:23,098 --> 00:50:26,849
What's this?
The Egyptian exodus?

383
00:50:27,765 --> 00:50:29,683
Nobody wants us.

384
00:50:30,017 --> 00:50:32,681
I have some room left.

385
00:51:07,055 --> 00:51:08,681
Here we are.

386
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:17,598
-Mister...
- Call me Sam.

387
00:51:17,807 --> 00:51:20,142
I don't know how to thank you.

388
00:51:20,143 --> 00:51:23,099
We all need a roof over our heads.

389
00:51:23,100 --> 00:51:24,100
Podem entrar, vamos.

390
00:51:41,016 --> 00:51:43,223
Let me take care of that.

391
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,224
- What about the baby?
- He's sleeping.

392
00:51:50,308 --> 00:51:54,764
<i>No sea so distinguished
as the sea of Scheveningen.</i>

393
00:51:54,973 --> 00:51:58,850
<i>Only the Haute Vollée bathes there.</i>

394
00:51:59,142 --> 00:52:03,349
<i>No beach is as charming
as the beach of Scheveningen.</i>

395
00:52:03,558 --> 00:52:07,225
<i>It 's where the flower
of Holland flirts.</i>

396
00:52:07,516 --> 00:52:09,099
Now it's your turn.

397
00:52:16,267 --> 00:52:18,680
We have no job for you.

398
00:52:26,222 --> 00:52:30,930
<i>No sea so distinguished
as the sea of Scheveningen.</i>

399
00:52:31,306 --> 00:52:35,848
<i>It 's not filled with jellyfish
because they stay on the beach.</i>

400
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,807
I'm looking for my
brother, Waldemar.

401
00:53:08,224 --> 00:53:10,433
So you must be Hilda...
Or Lilly?

402
00:53:11,391 --> 00:53:14,389
Hilda?
How did you find me?

403
00:53:14,639 --> 00:53:16,599
Our cousin gave me your address.

404
00:53:16,764 --> 00:53:19,683
- Please come in, I'm Rika.
- Not in this mess.

405
00:53:20,141 --> 00:53:22,391
So what. We'll just ignore it.

406
00:53:22,724 --> 00:53:25,433
Let's have some coffee.

407
00:53:31,057 --> 00:53:34,892
Will the two of you marry?
- She needs a divorce first.

408
00:53:35,309 --> 00:53:38,184
- Does she have more children?
- Four.

409
00:53:38,392 --> 00:53:40,138
Four?

410
00:53:42,139 --> 00:53:46,181
- What's her age?
- 37.

411
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,555
You are seeing a married
woman who's 17 years older?

412
00:53:49,763 --> 00:53:52,764
Our father's mistress is
17 years younger than him.

413
00:53:53,014 --> 00:53:55,598
That's accepted.
The reverse is not.

414
00:53:55,806 --> 00:53:58,514
Ridiculous, don't you think?

415
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:01,223
You were mamma's Ocean Swimmer.

416
00:54:01,599 --> 00:54:05,725
You were supposed to study and
return and make it big time.

417
00:54:06,014 --> 00:54:08,306
You can't have that
future with that woman.

418
00:54:08,556 --> 00:54:10,931
Her name is Rika.

419
00:54:16,307 --> 00:54:20,056
I had very different expectations.

420
00:54:20,307 --> 00:54:21,807
Me too.

421
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:24,639
Go with me to the Dutch Indies.

422
00:54:25,098 --> 00:54:30,974
Jo has a terrific job there.
They need people like you.

423
00:54:31,349 --> 00:54:33,097
You can still escape.

424
00:54:33,347 --> 00:54:36,056
Who says I want to?

425
00:54:37,182 --> 00:54:40,558
Do you ever wonder what
mamma would think of this?

426
00:54:42,974 --> 00:54:46,516
She'd turn in her grave.

427
00:54:55,308 --> 00:54:57,933
I'm cancelling your allowance.

428
00:55:03,472 --> 00:55:06,806
Where is your sister?
- She left.

429
00:55:08,097 --> 00:55:10,014
Is she coming back?

430
00:55:12,306 --> 00:55:15,598
She's leaving tomorrow
to join her husband.

431
00:55:16,598 --> 00:55:20,390
Where to?
- Batavia.

432
00:55:23,682 --> 00:55:27,681
- How deep can we fall .
- What?

433
00:55:28,806 --> 00:55:32,931
You shut the door in my face
as if I'm a piece of rubbish.

434
00:55:33,140 --> 00:55:36,222
Are you ashamed of me?

435
00:55:38,098 --> 00:55:42,182
Your silence tells me all
I need to know.

436
00:55:51,183 --> 00:55:55,389
- I dropped out of college.
- So you're looking for a job?

437
00:55:56,015 --> 00:55:59,349
I applied a million
times. But the crisis...

438
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:02,016
Yes, they have a good excuse.

439
00:56:02,391 --> 00:56:05,183
I live with a baby and
a woman in a small room.

440
00:56:05,391 --> 00:56:08,308
Most Surinam men would leave.

441
00:56:08,600 --> 00:56:09,892
What about Waldy!

442
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:15,058
I grew up without my father.
I coped with it better than you.

443
00:56:15,433 --> 00:56:19,517
- A job would be great.
- I'll see what I can do.

444
00:56:21,013 --> 00:56:26,638
Good morning, gentlemen. This
is our new employee Mr. Nods.

445
00:56:27,348 --> 00:56:29,972
Teurlings, will
you show him around?

446
00:56:39,348 --> 00:56:42,223
Is that my place?

447
00:56:43,682 --> 00:56:47,391
And who is Mr. Teurlings?

448
00:56:50,264 --> 00:56:53,140
Waldemar Nods.

449
00:56:53,806 --> 00:56:57,057
You must know somebody
who pulls the strings here.

450
00:56:57,348 --> 00:57:00,515
Only last week three men got fired.

451
00:57:02,349 --> 00:57:05,474
Can you explain to me
what I'm supposed to do?

452
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:08,515
Yes, what would that be?

453
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:14,141
I guess they never taught
you in the jungle , did they?

454
00:58:02,057 --> 00:58:04,557
From your mother.

455
00:58:24,557 --> 00:58:26,432
Do you think mamma misses us?

456
00:58:26,723 --> 00:58:30,057
Why should she?
She has a new child .

457
00:58:35,972 --> 00:58:39,723
<i>Six years later.</i>

458
00:58:50,725 --> 00:58:54,141
- Where is daddy?
-In the sea.

459
00:59:04,764 --> 00:59:08,056
Daddy, I'm scared.

460
00:59:08,722 --> 00:59:11,847
Waldy, you should learn to swim.

461
00:59:12,847 --> 00:59:16,264
<i>You have to make long strokes.</i>

462
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:18,389
Right.

463
01:00:25,847 --> 01:00:28,764
Waldemar is homesick.

464
01:00:29,264 --> 01:00:32,014
I'm not blind.

465
01:00:32,473 --> 01:00:35,555
- Close your eyes.
- Why should I.

466
01:00:36,014 --> 01:00:40,765
Close your eyes, Rika.
I have something for you.

467
01:00:44,807 --> 01:00:48,349
Now you can look.

468
01:00:50,350 --> 01:00:53,765
I've taken care of the money.
It's yours now.

469
01:01:02,640 --> 01:01:05,724
Our own guesthouse.

470
01:01:32,808 --> 01:01:36,100
It has to be ready in a month.
- Why so soon?

471
01:01:36,349 --> 01:01:39,016
Because the children
will visit us by then.

472
01:01:39,266 --> 01:01:44,059
We have our own house now.
Perhaps they can visit more often.

473
01:01:51,473 --> 01:01:56,139
Where are Mimi and Greta?
- Fired.

474
01:01:56,472 --> 01:01:58,847
You want me to help ?

475
01:01:59,098 --> 01:02:02,681
I don't need any help .
- This house has 12 rooms!

476
01:02:02,889 --> 01:02:05,682
Which I'm all going to rent out.

477
01:02:12,306 --> 01:02:14,848
- What's wrong with you?
- This is daddy's room.

478
01:02:15,139 --> 01:02:17,265
- It 's the best room.
- And if he returns?

479
01:02:17,515 --> 01:02:20,889
Forget about it.
Don't you understand?

480
01:02:23,099 --> 01:02:26,307
Just forget about it.
- Why should I?

481
01:02:26,723 --> 01:02:29,556
Neutral territory, said the judge.

482
01:02:29,932 --> 01:02:33,015
This is a guesthouse.
That's neutral territory.

483
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:35,265
This will cause a lot of trouble .

484
01:02:35,641 --> 01:02:38,973
I can do anything I want.

485
01:02:49,975 --> 01:02:52,808
Wonderful to see you again.

486
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:55,934
Come, we don't have much time.

487
01:03:02,642 --> 01:03:05,638
- Why do you greet him?
- I know him, don't I.

488
01:03:05,972 --> 01:03:07,763
Can't you see he doesn't like it?

489
01:03:07,972 --> 01:03:11,305
Don't think for others.
Follow your own instinct.

490
01:03:11,639 --> 01:03:14,223
That's easy for you to say.

491
01:03:14,972 --> 01:03:17,889
Are daddy and Jans happy together?

492
01:03:29,808 --> 01:03:34,640
- Where are you taking us?
- I want to show you my guesthouse.

493
01:03:34,847 --> 01:03:36,557
That's not allowed.

494
01:03:36,848 --> 01:03:39,723
Yes it is. It 's like a hotel
It's neutral

495
01:03:40,057 --> 01:03:43,640
But you live there, don't you?
- Yes I do.

496
01:04:00,847 --> 01:04:03,723
Most of our guests are performers.

497
01:04:04,181 --> 01:04:06,933
I have a maid now.
Her name is Agnes.

498
01:04:07,183 --> 01:04:09,182
I'm not allowed to be here.

499
01:04:09,599 --> 01:04:13,433
I worked hard to finish it
so I could show it to you.

500
01:04:13,724 --> 01:04:15,930
I now have my own house.

501
01:04:15,931 --> 01:04:18,349
It has enough rooms
for you to stay in.

502
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:19,933
Aren't you proud?

503
01:04:20,225 --> 01:04:23,350
It 's not what was agreed.
- Agreed?

504
01:04:23,684 --> 01:04:26,972
That is completely unreasonable .

505
01:04:27,305 --> 01:04:31,305
Is it normal for a mother to see
her children two hours a year?

506
01:04:31,556 --> 01:04:33,889
Half of them don't even show up.

507
01:04:34,098 --> 01:04:36,972
I wouldn't even
recognize Jan and Wim now.

508
01:04:37,180 --> 01:04:41,098
They wouldn't recognize you
either, dressed up like that.

509
01:04:43,306 --> 01:04:47,015
I want to leave.
I don't feel comfortable here.

510
01:04:47,974 --> 01:04:49,974
Alright.

511
01:04:52,558 --> 01:04:54,306
Let's go.

512
01:05:01,974 --> 01:05:03,144
Where is Waldy?

513
01:05:03,145 --> 01:05:05,640
We're playing hide and seek.

514
01:05:06,099 --> 01:05:08,349
Shouldn't you look for him?

515
01:05:08,890 --> 01:05:11,890
No. Stupid game.

516
01:05:15,765 --> 01:05:21,348
<i>...National Socialism and Fascism
are the future of the New Europe...</i>

517
01:05:21,973 --> 01:05:28,225
<i>but above all , comrades,
you are Dutchmen.</i>

518
01:05:29,391 --> 01:05:30,724
Come in.

519
01:05:31,766 --> 01:05:34,516
I wanted to show this to you.

520
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:38,267
Another certificate!

521
01:05:38,516 --> 01:05:41,225
All you do at night is study.

522
01:05:41,392 --> 01:05:43,892
German Commercial Correspondence.

523
01:05:43,893 --> 01:05:46,059
Mark my words, that will be of use.

524
01:05:46,308 --> 01:05:50,805
Am I in line for a promotion?
- Dutch people get priority.

525
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:52,764
I am Dutch.

526
01:05:53,264 --> 01:05:57,888
Nods, you do a good job.
That's why you still have one.

527
01:06:02,348 --> 01:06:07,264
<i>...Men with a heart
filled with love...</i>

528
01:06:09,516 --> 01:06:14,514
<i>As you have broken the arrangement
to meet on neutral territory...</i>

529
01:06:14,848 --> 01:06:20,057
<i>... you will not be allowed,
for a period of two years...</i>

530
01:06:20,306 --> 01:06:24,515
<i>... to receive your children
in the city of The Hague.</i>

531
01:06:30,932 --> 01:06:34,223
Willem, you can't do this to me.

532
01:06:36,724 --> 01:06:40,766
Open the door!
Let's talk about this.

533
01:06:48,183 --> 01:06:51,099
Bertha!
- Mom!

534
01:06:51,766 --> 01:06:53,558
Please, open the door.

535
01:06:53,808 --> 01:06:56,766
I can't see you for two years.
That's too long!

536
01:06:56,975 --> 01:07:00,725
- Shouldn't we let her in?
- That's out of the question.

537
01:07:01,058 --> 01:07:05,225
Wim! I'm still your mother!
I want to see you all !

538
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:16,265
I should have never
let you go. Never.

539
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:26,517
He's got a high fever!

540
01:08:33,888 --> 01:08:37,848
He has double pneumonia.
We'll have to wait.

541
01:08:48,889 --> 01:08:52,433
We are being punished.

542
01:08:56,723 --> 01:09:00,806
Lord forgive me. Please cure him.

543
01:09:29,348 --> 01:09:32,224
The hospital called.

544
01:09:51,889 --> 01:09:56,598
Mamma has appendicitis.
- She's not dying, is she?

545
01:10:08,097 --> 01:10:10,181
I'll go fetch a doctor.

546
01:10:14,516 --> 01:10:17,542
Waldemar, when you go to Holland...

547
01:10:17,543 --> 01:10:19,098
l' m not going.

548
01:10:21,806 --> 01:10:26,182
Never leave the people you love.

549
01:10:26,390 --> 01:10:28,599
I'll stay with you.

550
01:10:29,056 --> 01:10:31,515
You will go to college.

551
01:10:31,891 --> 01:10:36,098
I don't want to be alone.
l'm not sure I can manage.

552
01:10:37,474 --> 01:10:43,558
You are your father's son.
You'll manage.

553
01:10:45,264 --> 01:10:48,140
Even without me.

554
01:10:55,807 --> 01:10:58,266
How is he doing?

555
01:11:09,559 --> 01:11:11,805
You'll wake him up.

556
01:11:12,472 --> 01:11:14,722
I can't face this any longer.

557
01:11:20,055 --> 01:11:21,805
Daddy?

558
01:11:29,556 --> 01:11:32,057
Hey, Sonny Boy.

559
01:11:37,433 --> 01:11:39,222
Get well soon.

560
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,099
<i>Dear Bertha.</i>

561
01:11:53,474 --> 01:11:56,182
<i>Your father finally
consented to a divorce.</i>

562
01:11:56,390 --> 01:11:58,766
<i>He had no other choice.</i>

563
01:11:58,974 --> 01:12:02,849
<i>I will marry Waldemar and I
regret that you can not be there.</i>

564
01:12:03,141 --> 01:12:06,806
<i>Don't be sad about
moving to Groningen.</i>

565
01:12:07,015 --> 01:12:09,723
<i>Waldemar says distance
doesn't matter.</i>

566
01:12:10,182 --> 01:12:13,933
<i>Every breath I take is for you.</i>

567
01:12:14,348 --> 01:12:16,391
<i>My spirit is always with you.</i>

568
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:20,767
<i>Never forget that my heart
belongs to my beloved children.</i>

569
01:12:38,139 --> 01:12:41,722
<i>Summer, 1940</i>

570
01:13:00,015 --> 01:13:03,890
Good day to you, madam, sir.

571
01:13:04,432 --> 01:13:07,390
Do you have rooms available ?

572
01:13:07,807 --> 01:13:14,099
No we don't. In summer we
serve tourists, not soldiers.

573
01:13:14,349 --> 01:13:17,723
Of course we will pay well .

574
01:13:18,098 --> 01:13:21,265
It 's an order Rika.
We don't have a choice.

575
01:13:21,682 --> 01:13:24,224
I'm not taking orders from anyone.

576
01:13:24,807 --> 01:13:27,681
How many rooms do you need?

577
01:13:35,766 --> 01:13:37,932
Look at me!

578
01:13:38,224 --> 01:13:40,933
Very nice. You are a boy scout.
- Yes!

579
01:13:41,350 --> 01:13:44,058
What do you want to
be when you are older?

580
01:13:44,266 --> 01:13:50,225
Soldier. I want to be a soldier.
With pistols . Like you.

581
01:13:51,683 --> 01:13:55,014
Your mother should be proud of you.

582
01:13:55,388 --> 01:13:59,514
Too bad the boy scouts will be
forbidden. Orders from the Führer.

583
01:13:59,972 --> 01:14:03,430
You will have to
turn in the uniform.

584
01:14:03,764 --> 01:14:05,972
What did he say?

585
01:14:06,306 --> 01:14:10,098
That you have to be
careful with your uniform.

586
01:14:28,599 --> 01:14:32,349
Hi mom.
Look who's here.

587
01:14:34,641 --> 01:14:37,766
- My God.
- Hi mom.

588
01:14:38,681 --> 01:14:44,058
This can't be true!
Jan! My son!

589
01:14:46,725 --> 01:14:48,473
Please, come in.

590
01:14:55,475 --> 01:14:59,766
To my children. Who are
all here, except one...

591
01:15:00,183 --> 01:15:02,516
and whom I love so much.

592
01:15:02,808 --> 01:15:07,808
And to God, who brought me
Bertha, Henk and Jan.

593
01:15:08,183 --> 01:15:11,309
I think it was the
train that brought them.

594
01:15:17,972 --> 01:15:19,640
How is Wim?

595
01:15:20,014 --> 01:15:23,639
He works as a doctor in Friesland.

596
01:15:23,889 --> 01:15:27,097
I regret I haven't
seen him for so long.

597
01:15:27,889 --> 01:15:29,932
Don't say anything.

598
01:15:30,223 --> 01:15:32,972
He takes after his father.

599
01:15:39,517 --> 01:15:42,264
Jan is planning to be engaged.

600
01:15:42,973 --> 01:15:46,224
Oh, how nice Jan!

601
01:15:46,557 --> 01:15:48,849
With a Catholic girl

602
01:15:49,057 --> 01:15:51,389
How does your father
feel about that?

603
01:15:51,598 --> 01:15:53,765
He kicked me out.

604
01:15:56,349 --> 01:16:00,349
You will always have a bed here.

605
01:16:05,974 --> 01:16:07,847
<i>May 1942</i>

606
01:16:08,556 --> 01:16:12,015
- That's the last one.
- This is ridiculous.

607
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,517
What do they want
with these labels?

608
01:16:15,892 --> 01:16:17,933
So they can spot us.

609
01:16:18,349 --> 01:16:21,849
What's next?
Will they brand you?

610
01:16:22,683 --> 01:16:27,225
Rika... Next time you come by...

611
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:37,097
I'm afraid I won't be here.

612
01:16:38,388 --> 01:16:41,473
Sam, do I have to worry about you?

613
01:16:43,181 --> 01:16:46,139
You are my tower of strength.

614
01:16:51,181 --> 01:16:53,889
I don't want to lose you.

615
01:16:54,139 --> 01:16:56,307
So stay.

616
01:16:57,265 --> 01:17:00,391
I'll stay.

617
01:17:10,140 --> 01:17:15,349
Sorry to trouble you.
Please accept my apologies.

618
01:17:18,891 --> 01:17:20,807
What does it say?

619
01:17:21,182 --> 01:17:23,766
We have to evacuate our house.

620
01:17:24,349 --> 01:17:26,599
Within three weeks.

621
01:17:26,974 --> 01:17:29,681
That can't be true.

622
01:17:30,139 --> 01:17:32,556
We are in a strategically
sensitive area.

623
01:17:32,807 --> 01:17:36,683
Why does God need to take
away our home as well ?

624
01:17:36,891 --> 01:17:39,516
Not God, Rika.

625
01:17:40,432 --> 01:17:42,600
The Germans.

626
01:17:48,933 --> 01:17:50,934
Why do you always take pictures?

627
01:17:51,266 --> 01:17:54,142
As a memento. For later.

628
01:17:54,475 --> 01:17:58,263
- So you can see how it was?
- Yes.

629
01:18:04,931 --> 01:18:07,889
It's pretty here, isn't it?

630
01:18:09,181 --> 01:18:10,640
Yes...

631
01:18:11,014 --> 01:18:13,889
I don't want to leave here.

632
01:18:15,098 --> 01:18:17,973
I didn't want to leave Surinam.

633
01:18:18,474 --> 01:18:20,849
Couldn't you stay?

634
01:18:21,266 --> 01:18:23,431
No.

635
01:18:24,431 --> 01:18:25,932
Do you miss it?

636
01:18:26,306 --> 01:18:28,973
Not right now.

637
01:18:30,557 --> 01:18:33,181
You're here.

638
01:18:43,432 --> 01:18:46,016
The Germans can
take my house, but...

639
01:18:46,349 --> 01:18:48,474
I want something equal
in size in return.

640
01:18:48,683 --> 01:18:51,098
You can't make demands.

641
01:18:51,431 --> 01:18:55,099
Sure I can.
Here's a letter from church.

642
01:18:56,683 --> 01:19:00,516
So you have five children?

643
01:19:22,223 --> 01:19:23,764
Why are you hiding this?

644
01:19:23,973 --> 01:19:27,222
It 's nobody's business
that we own these things.

645
01:19:27,973 --> 01:19:32,473
If you don't want anybody to
find it, you need to hide it.

646
01:19:32,848 --> 01:19:36,098
- Who's going to search for it?
- Nobody.

647
01:19:38,057 --> 01:19:41,058
Mrs. Nods... Follow me, please.

648
01:19:47,682 --> 01:19:51,182
Somebody wants to
take your confession.

649
01:19:59,140 --> 01:20:03,140
- Mrs. Nods?
- That's me.

650
01:20:04,723 --> 01:20:08,641
I'm seeking help. For people
who are having a hard time.

651
01:20:09,141 --> 01:20:11,722
Who's not having a
hard time these days?

652
01:20:12,056 --> 01:20:15,223
People who don't stand a
chance against the Germans.

653
01:20:15,598 --> 01:20:20,683
Forbidden people in a forbidden
time, in a forbidden territory.

654
01:20:20,975 --> 01:20:23,225
What do you want from me?

655
01:20:24,141 --> 01:20:27,767
We're looking for rooms...
And you have a large house.

656
01:20:28,017 --> 01:20:31,100
- It 's my livelihood.
- You will get paid.

657
01:20:31,308 --> 01:20:35,684
Sixty guilders a month for
Jews, forty five for Dutch.

658
01:20:37,017 --> 01:20:38,789
Give me some Jews then.

659
01:20:38,797 --> 01:20:43,639
These people will stay briefly untiI
we transfer them to the countryside.

660
01:20:43,889 --> 01:20:47,180
- People will come and go.
- I'm used to that.

661
01:20:47,472 --> 01:20:52,306
There's a risk. If you get
caught you will be punished.

662
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:55,098
Punished? For housing people?

663
01:20:55,473 --> 01:20:58,974
It's a strange world we live in.

664
01:21:00,516 --> 01:21:03,225
You're not a priest.

665
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,973
Not even Catholic.

666
01:21:06,181 --> 01:21:09,348
- But a Christian.
- Protestant.

667
01:21:09,890 --> 01:21:15,849
I want to see your face.
I want to look you in the eyes.

668
01:21:26,474 --> 01:21:28,558
My name is Paul Vermeer.

669
01:21:28,891 --> 01:21:32,639
But you're just a boy.

670
01:21:33,431 --> 01:21:36,683
I'm 24. Please call me Paul.

671
01:21:36,684 --> 01:21:38,241
I'm Rika.

672
01:21:39,100 --> 01:21:44,350
- Maybe you should think about it.
- In war you need to act.

673
01:21:45,058 --> 01:21:52,058
- Life before philosophy.
- Exactly. They will be welcome.

674
01:21:59,597 --> 01:22:05,056
You will have to be quiet. My son
doesn't know you'll be upstairs.

675
01:22:11,848 --> 01:22:15,574
You need a lot.
It 's too obvious.

676
01:22:15,575 --> 01:22:17,581
I have a guesthouse.

677
01:22:17,756 --> 01:22:22,015
You don't have German
officers as an alibi now.

678
01:22:32,849 --> 01:22:38,974
Walk, you scum! We want
our Jewish blood money!

679
01:23:07,308 --> 01:23:10,683
Niggers shouldn't be boy scouts.

680
01:23:43,725 --> 01:23:47,432
- Are you Mrs. Nods?
- Yes.

681
01:23:48,764 --> 01:23:51,223
Can we have a word?

682
01:23:52,223 --> 01:23:54,433
We had to pull him
away from this boy.

683
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:57,098
- I saw Sam!
- How is the boy doing?

684
01:23:57,390 --> 01:23:59,141
He took quite a beating.

685
01:23:59,432 --> 01:24:03,391
But he's a healthy Dutch boy.
He'll get back on his feet.

686
01:24:03,850 --> 01:24:07,057
If I catch you
again, you go to jail

687
01:24:07,266 --> 01:24:12,850
Got me? And another thing.
You're forbidden.

688
01:24:13,100 --> 01:24:14,681
- What?
- Your uniform.

689
01:24:14,889 --> 01:24:16,889
Don't bother. l' ll burn it.

690
01:24:17,098 --> 01:24:19,265
- Why?
- As punishment.

691
01:24:19,515 --> 01:24:24,224
Very good. We'll find our way out.

692
01:24:32,474 --> 01:24:36,850
- What's that?
- The maid.

693
01:24:50,431 --> 01:24:54,639
For Christ's sake what are
you... Waldy! Come back!

694
01:25:12,223 --> 01:25:14,473
These people need to hide.

695
01:25:14,849 --> 01:25:18,098
Otherwise they'll be caught.
Do you understand?

696
01:25:20,223 --> 01:25:23,600
- So what about Sam?
- Nothing.

697
01:25:25,473 --> 01:25:30,433
<i>One year later</i>

698
01:25:47,516 --> 01:25:50,559
Do they think they can
win the war like this?

699
01:25:51,017 --> 01:25:54,850
- You have to return to Groningen.
- Why?

700
01:25:55,142 --> 01:25:57,475
It 's no longer safe here.

701
01:25:58,058 --> 01:26:01,889
- What about you?
- Don't worry about me.

702
01:26:02,264 --> 01:26:06,681
But I do. Especially now
we can see each other again.

703
01:26:07,139 --> 01:26:11,389
I don't want to lose you.
I want to be with you.

704
01:26:11,723 --> 01:26:14,556
And I want to be with you.

705
01:26:14,806 --> 01:26:18,473
- Come with me, to Groningen.
- No, I can't leave here.

706
01:26:22,473 --> 01:26:27,474
- Will you be careful.
- I won't let them destroy me.

707
01:26:28,347 --> 01:26:32,015
Not a huge load of
laundry this time.

708
01:26:32,432 --> 01:26:35,765
- Just a regular load?
- Regular?

709
01:26:36,057 --> 01:26:38,599
A gentile in need of hiding.

710
01:26:39,223 --> 01:26:43,640
- Somebody from the resistance?
- A deserter from the SS.

711
01:26:44,433 --> 01:26:47,682
- That's odd.
- Why?

712
01:26:48,265 --> 01:26:51,475
A resistance fighter
saving an SS member?

713
01:26:51,932 --> 01:26:53,475
Ex-SS. He deserted.

714
01:26:53,683 --> 01:26:56,973
- But he signed up first.
- He wanted some adventure.

715
01:26:57,182 --> 01:26:58,848
He was 18. And naive.

716
01:26:59,056 --> 01:27:05,308
- And he ran away when he felt like it.
- That's only human, isn't it?

717
01:27:05,683 --> 01:27:08,183
It doesn't show much fortitude.

718
01:27:08,391 --> 01:27:11,600
This boy will be shot
if they catch him.

719
01:27:11,808 --> 01:27:15,224
But to have him share
space with with the Jews...

720
01:27:15,516 --> 01:27:20,726
- I don't know... what do you think?
- Everybody deserves a second chance.

721
01:27:28,514 --> 01:27:32,181
This is Gerard van Haringen.
He will be staying here.

722
01:27:32,514 --> 01:27:38,931
Welcome Gerard. Have you
eaten? l'll go get a plate.

723
01:27:46,891 --> 01:27:50,473
What is the reason you are here?

724
01:27:52,432 --> 01:27:57,016
- Same as you.
- I doubt it.

725
01:28:08,849 --> 01:28:12,558
You take the rope,
put it like that...

726
01:28:18,556 --> 01:28:21,682
Really. Try again. Once more.

727
01:28:39,017 --> 01:28:42,059
Hey, big boy scout,
what's going on?

728
01:28:42,476 --> 01:28:47,264
Did you have a fight or something?
So what's up?

729
01:28:48,264 --> 01:28:50,473
Nothing.

730
01:28:51,057 --> 01:28:56,222
You had too much water in your head,
so you opened the floodgates.

731
01:28:58,806 --> 01:29:02,848
That's much better.
What's going on?

732
01:29:03,932 --> 01:29:08,058
I want to get my second star.
- After the war?

733
01:29:08,516 --> 01:29:11,389
Yes.
But these knots drive me crazy.

734
01:29:11,806 --> 01:29:13,973
- Is that all ?
- Yes.

735
01:29:14,390 --> 01:29:17,140
If only you knew
how often I failed.

736
01:29:17,349 --> 01:29:20,015
- Did you ever see me cry?
- No.

737
01:29:20,474 --> 01:29:26,433
Come here, stand straight.
Are you a reaI boy scout?

738
01:29:26,724 --> 01:29:28,515
- Yes.
- I thought so too.

739
01:29:28,848 --> 01:29:30,865
You must keep one thing in mind:

740
01:29:30,866 --> 01:29:33,016
a real boy scout never cries.

741
01:29:33,516 --> 01:29:34,981
You hear me?
Never.

742
01:29:34,982 --> 01:29:36,500
So repeat after me.

743
01:29:36,575 --> 01:29:38,465
a real boy scout never cries.

744
01:29:38,466 --> 01:29:40,566
A real boy scout never cries.

745
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:41,940
Louder!

746
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:43,565
- A reaI boy scout never cries!

747
01:29:43,515 --> 01:29:45,933
Perfect. Now lift
two fingers and swear.

748
01:29:46,141 --> 01:29:48,766
A reaI boy scout never cries.

749
01:29:49,099 --> 01:30:00,309
Very good. You feeI better now?
Good boy.

750
01:30:07,181 --> 01:30:10,815
I heard that all the Jews
that have to turn themselves in...

751
01:30:10,922 --> 01:30:13,013
...are sent to camps in Germany.

752
01:30:13,014 --> 01:30:15,348
Supposedly to work.

753
01:30:15,723 --> 01:30:19,681
- To make themselves useful.
- But what really happens is this.

754
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:22,723
lmpossible .
That's hundreds of people .

755
01:30:23,056 --> 01:30:28,099
Thousands. And the people who
help them are sent away too.

756
01:30:29,224 --> 01:30:33,640
But they deserve it.
They know they're wrong.

757
01:30:34,890 --> 01:30:37,265
So the Jews don't deserve it?

758
01:30:37,557 --> 01:30:41,349
It was just their luck
to be born that way.

759
01:30:46,724 --> 01:30:50,432
Waldemar should 've
been home already.

760
01:31:01,182 --> 01:31:04,098
- Do you like it?
- Are you allowed to make music?

761
01:31:04,307 --> 01:31:08,099
- Why wouldn't I.
- What if someone notices?

762
01:31:08,308 --> 01:31:11,350
Well , then we just say it's him.

763
01:31:14,226 --> 01:31:17,475
- Isn't that a German song?
- What?

764
01:31:17,683 --> 01:31:20,184
I think you're
playing a German song.

765
01:31:20,433 --> 01:31:23,351
- Could be.
- I'd rather not hear it.

766
01:31:23,643 --> 01:31:25,854
- German songs aren't suspicious.

767
01:31:26,055 --> 01:31:28,264
Still no reason to play them.

768
01:31:28,597 --> 01:31:31,348
I can play the same melody
with different words.

769
01:31:31,723 --> 01:31:34,347
I'm not singing
our national anthem.

770
01:31:35,513 --> 01:31:42,765
# If all are unfaithful,
we remain true... #

771
01:31:43,139 --> 01:31:50,016
# so that there will always be
a troop on earth for you. #

772
01:31:50,391 --> 01:31:52,806
Dirty bastard.

773
01:31:53,932 --> 01:31:57,766
Come Gerard,
let's go to my room.

774
01:32:08,933 --> 01:32:14,390
Where were you?
It's past curfew.

775
01:32:15,516 --> 01:32:18,558
I needed some fresh air.

776
01:32:20,932 --> 01:32:24,724
- What's the matter?
- I'm scared.

777
01:32:25,683 --> 01:32:28,565
Of what is going on all around us,

778
01:32:28,566 --> 01:32:30,600
and even in our house.

779
01:32:31,016 --> 01:32:34,558
What about Waldy, if
something happens to us?

780
01:32:34,767 --> 01:32:38,725
- That won't happen.
- How do you know?

781
01:32:42,683 --> 01:32:44,850
I want to go away.

782
01:32:45,476 --> 01:32:49,348
What do you mean?
Away from this house?

783
01:32:52,598 --> 01:32:54,807
Away from this country.

784
01:32:55,639 --> 01:32:59,765
Away from Europe.
From this war.

785
01:33:00,348 --> 01:33:03,349
I want to take you
and Waldy to Surinam.

786
01:33:04,639 --> 01:33:08,599
But the borders are closed.

787
01:33:10,433 --> 01:33:14,056
I'll talk to David. Maybe
he can arrange something.

788
01:33:14,389 --> 01:33:16,848
Yeah... An airplane.

789
01:33:47,975 --> 01:33:50,308
Mom!

790
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:59,849
Upstairs lads, that's where they are.

791
01:34:07,597 --> 01:34:09,263
Here they are!

792
01:34:19,764 --> 01:34:22,973
Hush, don't say a word.

793
01:34:24,431 --> 01:34:27,391
Come on you! Hurry up!

794
01:34:27,891 --> 01:34:30,016
You're coming with us.

795
01:34:31,599 --> 01:34:34,139
Dirty nigger.

796
01:34:37,556 --> 01:34:41,516
And take this brown shrimp too.

797
01:34:45,140 --> 01:34:47,224
You don't belong here.

798
01:34:48,182 --> 01:34:52,516
Hurry up down those stairs.
Filthy Jew.

799
01:34:53,641 --> 01:34:56,858
Good work boys.
A big score.

800
01:34:56,959 --> 01:34:58,492
Take them away.

801
01:35:13,183 --> 01:35:16,527
Hey, Gerard.

802
01:35:16,528 --> 01:35:18,142
A real boy scout never cries.

803
01:35:41,264 --> 01:35:44,306
- Don't be scared.
- Shut up.

804
01:35:50,599 --> 01:35:53,016
When we get out of here,
we go to Surinam.

805
01:35:53,225 --> 01:35:56,848
- It's always warm there.
- We will swim in the river.

806
01:35:57,098 --> 01:36:00,474
Shut up! Damn it.

807
01:36:06,432 --> 01:36:10,724
Poor little resistance fighter,
did you hurt yourself?

808
01:36:11,224 --> 01:36:14,516
We will make you talk, Jew lover.

809
01:36:24,807 --> 01:36:27,307
Here, give this to daddy.

810
01:36:28,266 --> 01:36:32,516
What do you have there?
Tell me, what do you have there?

811
01:36:32,933 --> 01:36:36,642
Open your hands, immediately!

812
01:36:44,141 --> 01:36:47,767
You. What do you have there?

813
01:36:48,268 --> 01:36:50,222
It's clear you have something.

814
01:36:50,430 --> 01:36:54,348
Show me your hands!

815
01:36:59,514 --> 01:37:03,682
Give it to me.
Give me the money.

816
01:37:10,057 --> 01:37:12,307
You're allowed to go.

817
01:37:13,516 --> 01:37:15,681
Come on.

818
01:37:15,889 --> 01:37:18,932
Do as he says.
Go to uncle Marcel.

819
01:37:19,473 --> 01:37:23,974
No, I don't want to.
I want to stay with you.

820
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:28,015
I'm not going to uncle Marcel

821
01:37:34,057 --> 01:37:37,891
Get lost.
Go home.

822
01:39:11,808 --> 01:39:13,641
Sit down.

823
01:39:31,264 --> 01:39:34,180
My name is Kees Kaptein.

824
01:39:38,557 --> 01:39:42,597
The most successful
executioner of the Dutch Jews.

825
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:01,974
Does the name Kees
Chardon ring a bell?

826
01:40:03,974 --> 01:40:05,349
No.

827
01:40:05,558 --> 01:40:10,515
Maybe you only know him
by his alias. Paul Vermeer.

828
01:40:15,307 --> 01:40:17,307
Never heard of him.

829
01:40:17,682 --> 01:40:20,266
Why are you hiding Jews?

830
01:40:20,683 --> 01:40:23,058
I'm not hiding anybody.

831
01:40:23,599 --> 01:40:25,598
Those people live with me.

832
01:40:25,931 --> 01:40:29,348
I run a guesthouse. All
paying guests are welcome.

833
01:40:29,765 --> 01:40:33,890
- Even if they are hiding?
-It's not written on their forehead.

834
01:40:34,224 --> 01:40:37,350
It's sewn on their overcoats.

835
01:40:37,683 --> 01:40:40,017
Shall I give you some names?

836
01:40:41,684 --> 01:40:46,267
Abraham Cohen, Joseph Polak,
Herman de Bruin, Dobbe Franken.

837
01:40:46,475 --> 01:40:50,934
That all sounds very Jewish,
don't you think?

838
01:40:51,638 --> 01:40:53,723
If you say so.

839
01:40:54,806 --> 01:40:57,347
Stop lying.

840
01:40:58,432 --> 01:41:02,222
Why did they stay in your house?

841
01:41:03,723 --> 01:41:07,223
Everybody needs a
roof over their heads.

842
01:41:11,140 --> 01:41:14,391
Mom said I should go see you.

843
01:41:14,641 --> 01:41:17,933
- What happened?
- They are in prison.

844
01:41:18,514 --> 01:41:21,473
- And our house is gone.
- Gone?

845
01:41:21,807 --> 01:41:25,182
You can stay here.
Don't you worry.

846
01:41:25,599 --> 01:41:28,348
That's not possible .
Think of my nerves.

847
01:41:28,640 --> 01:41:31,640
Woman, at least for once shut up.

848
01:41:45,723 --> 01:41:48,931
Start talking, you stupid bitch!

849
01:41:49,348 --> 01:41:51,464
We know that Kees Chardon

850
01:41:51,465 --> 01:41:54,058
alias Paul Vermeer
wasn't a decent lawyer.

851
01:41:54,267 --> 01:41:57,266
He and a bunch of
morons helped Jews.

852
01:41:57,558 --> 01:41:59,975
And you acted as his assistant.

853
01:42:01,726 --> 01:42:05,766
A simple housewife...
Who would 've thought?

854
01:42:09,976 --> 01:42:12,268
I have nothing to say.

855
01:42:12,847 --> 01:42:16,931
Maybe we should change the rules.
Your little son...

856
01:42:18,098 --> 01:42:21,098
I bet you really love him.

857
01:42:21,431 --> 01:42:25,098
Shall we bring him and
give him the same treatment?

858
01:42:25,472 --> 01:42:28,223
- I'll let you watch.
- You're sick.

859
01:42:28,515 --> 01:42:31,389
Not as sick as you.
You live with a nigger.

860
01:42:31,764 --> 01:42:35,974
A racial disgrace!
That's what we call it.

861
01:42:36,224 --> 01:42:38,224
- Pick up her son.
- Não!

862
01:42:38,516 --> 01:42:42,682
He's with an uncle, isn't he?
These walls have ears.

863
01:42:47,724 --> 01:42:50,891
They're fetching Sonny Boy!

864
01:43:00,391 --> 01:43:03,558
Clear off,
outside!

865
01:43:04,474 --> 01:43:07,473
- Where is Waldy Nods?
- He's not here.

866
01:43:07,931 --> 01:43:10,599
Search the store and the house.

867
01:43:32,267 --> 01:43:36,930
I'm sure you understand we would
never keep such a cuckoo in the nest.

868
01:43:38,389 --> 01:43:43,389
We get rid of them. Nobody wants
such a black nuisance around.

869
01:43:44,681 --> 01:43:49,973
- Poor monkey. They're trash.
- Indeed.

870
01:44:30,931 --> 01:44:34,516
It's getting too dangerous
for him over here.

871
01:44:37,349 --> 01:44:42,058
I can go on for hours.
Until you drown.

872
01:44:42,725 --> 01:44:44,851
How many Jews?

873
01:44:57,930 --> 01:45:02,307
How come this
doesn't work with you?

874
01:45:02,973 --> 01:45:06,056
The water is my friend.

875
01:45:06,806 --> 01:45:09,228
Too bad it's your only friend.

876
01:45:09,229 --> 01:45:12,273
Your family kicked your son out.

877
01:45:23,223 --> 01:45:26,307
Why don't you sit for a while?

878
01:45:27,557 --> 01:45:29,932
It hurts to sit.

879
01:45:30,183 --> 01:45:34,349
- Did he give you a hard beating?
- With a curtain rail.

880
01:45:34,849 --> 01:45:38,641
That's Kapi's trademark.

881
01:45:40,307 --> 01:45:43,099
It can be worse.

882
01:45:44,183 --> 01:45:47,099
- Vera had...
- No mom, don't mention it.

883
01:45:49,223 --> 01:45:52,223
I have a daughter, she's your age.

884
01:45:53,849 --> 01:45:56,475
I have five children.

885
01:46:11,517 --> 01:46:16,097
Do you still have nothing to say?

886
01:46:19,598 --> 01:46:22,343
Ah well . It doesn't matter.

887
01:46:24,544 --> 01:46:26,598
You're nailed anyhow.

888
01:46:26,930 --> 01:46:32,140
If you pick up enough people ,
there's always one who breaks.

889
01:46:34,181 --> 01:46:39,600
In this case it was a young man
who truly understands our cause.

890
01:46:42,306 --> 01:46:45,515
Gerard van Haringen.

891
01:47:03,766 --> 01:47:06,183
What are you doing?

892
01:47:08,058 --> 01:47:11,432
I'm practicing.

893
01:47:12,182 --> 01:47:14,057
She's a pianist.

894
01:47:14,265 --> 01:47:18,475
Every day without practice
makes you play worse.

895
01:47:21,975 --> 01:47:25,642
Can you play Sonny Boy?

896
01:47:26,850 --> 01:47:28,934
I think so.

897
01:48:31,765 --> 01:48:36,682

- What does he write?
- That I should do my best in school

<i>No news from mamma
out of Ravensbrück.</i>

954
02:02:36,056 --> 02:02:38,806
<i>I miss you both.</i>

955
02:03:29,766 --> 02:03:33,516
Our rainy days.

956
02:03:49,847 --> 02:03:53,890
<i>The Führer has died.</i>

957
02:03:54,681 --> 02:03:58,014
Faith has stricken us hard.

958
02:03:58,973 --> 02:04:01,265
I'm very sorry.

959
02:04:01,932 --> 02:04:04,182
What to do with you now?

960
02:04:06,015 --> 02:04:09,724
We now have a new Führer, Dönitz.

961
02:04:10,558 --> 02:04:13,141
The enemy advances.

962
02:04:13,975 --> 02:04:17,015
There is only one way out.

963
02:04:17,973 --> 02:04:20,224
Over water.

964
02:04:22,515 --> 02:04:26,724
<b>Lübecker Bay</b>

965
02:05:24,973 --> 02:05:27,556
Our liberators!

966
02:05:53,307 --> 02:05:56,849
Stupid Britts!
It's us!

967
02:06:18,392 --> 02:06:20,850
The whole ship is burning.

968
02:06:21,225 --> 02:06:23,517
I need a smoke.

969
02:08:18,306 --> 02:08:20,474
Only Germans.

970
02:08:20,765 --> 02:08:23,557
No prisoners on board!

971
02:08:24,099 --> 02:08:26,473
Only SS!

972
02:08:28,182 --> 02:08:30,557
No prisoners!

973
02:09:09,017 --> 02:09:11,264
Somebody's swimming.

974
02:09:14,806 --> 02:09:19,598
- That man is black.
- Nevertheless he is a good swimmer.

975
02:09:21,515 --> 02:09:25,556
Where is he going?
To the other end of the ocean?

976
02:09:26,099 --> 02:09:28,182
He's swimming for his life.

977
02:09:40,182 --> 02:09:41,890
When will you shoot?

978
02:09:42,932 --> 02:09:45,474
On the count of three.

979
02:09:50,057 --> 02:09:52,099
I'm ready.

980
02:09:52,975 --> 02:09:54,267
One...

981
02:09:56,848 --> 02:09:58,015
Two...

982
02:10:00,933 --> 02:10:01,933
Three.

983
02:10:08,723 --> 02:10:10,974
We're good soldiers.

984
02:10:12,016 --> 02:10:14,183
We'll win this war!

985
02:10:40,223 --> 02:10:42,181
A letter from your uncle .

986
02:10:56,517 --> 02:10:59,098
What does he write?

987
02:11:01,141 --> 02:11:05,224
That's he received a
letter from a pianist...

988
02:11:15,267 --> 02:11:21,183
Oh céus...
Poor, poor boy.

989
02:12:04,557 --> 02:12:08,473
- Good to see you.
- You've grown a lot.

990
02:12:08,682 --> 02:12:13,307
- Where am I going to live?
- With your grandparents, for now.

991
02:12:13,516 --> 02:12:16,391
Until my father returns.

992
02:12:18,058 --> 02:12:20,348
We haven't heard from your father.

993
02:12:20,682 --> 02:12:23,390
I've got something for you.

994
02:12:24,015 --> 02:12:26,683
It's from your mother.

995
02:12:42,474 --> 02:12:47,515
<i>In the train. Goodbye dear children.
Bye father and mother.</i>

996
02:12:47,765 --> 02:12:51,890
<i>Goodbye dear brothers and sisters.
A big kiss for everybody.</i>

997
02:12:52,391 --> 02:12:55,058
<i>I'm going to Vught,
to my dear husband.</i>

998
02:12:55,350 --> 02:12:57,433
<i>Please pray for us.</i>

999
02:12:57,725 --> 02:13:00,100
<i>Have faith. I'll be brave.</i>

1000
02:13:00,392 --> 02:13:03,350
<i>Your loving mother, Rika.</i>

1001
02:13:19,640 --> 02:13:24,848
Months later, Waldy received word that his
father had died in the Cap Arcona disaster.

1002
02:13:24,973 --> 02:13:29,181
It was a mystery to him how
such a good swimmer could drown.

1003
02:13:30,348 --> 02:13:36,099
Sixty years after the war,
he learned the true story when a new book

1004
02:13:36,224 --> 02:13:40,267
about his parents revealed
previously undiscovered facts.

1005
02:13:44,099 --> 02:13:51,224
According to the pianist's letter,
Rika died of dysentery in early Macrh, 1945

1006
02:13:53,099 --> 02:13:56,891
Hilda and Jo Survived
a Japanese prison camp.

1007
02:13:57,017 --> 02:14:01,057
They returned to Holland
and gave Waldy a home.

1008
02:14:03,141 --> 02:14:10,181
Willem was upset at the news of Rika's death.
One year later he married Jans.

1009
02:14:12,182 --> 02:14:16,100
Bertha was the only one
who stayed in contact with Waldy.

1010
02:14:16,225 --> 02:14:19,225
His haIf -brothers could not cope.

1011
02:14:21,100 --> 02:14:28,142
MarceI kept searching for Waldemar
but eventually had to give up hope.

1012
02:14:30,183 --> 02:14:34,018
On ApriI 16, 1945,
Kees Chardon (PauI Vermeer)

1013
02:14:34,143 --> 02:14:39,223
died of exhaustion in a
labour camp near Neuengamme.

1014
02:14:41,181 --> 02:14:48,181
Of all the arrested Jews, only Dobbe
survived the concentration camps.

1015
02:14:50,223 --> 02:14:52,931
Gerard van Haningen was sent to Dachau.

1016
02:14:53,056 --> 02:14:56,057
After the war he moved
to a West Frisian Island.

1017
02:14:56,182 --> 02:15:00,225
Because of this, Waldy never set
foot on any of the Frisian Islands.

1018
02:15:02,140 --> 02:15:09,141
Kees Kaptein was tried
and executed for his war crimes.

1019
02:15:11,265 --> 02:15:15,057
Waldy became a journalist. He married

1020
02:15:15,182 --> 02:15:20,266
and had children.
He lost his parents but kept afloat.
