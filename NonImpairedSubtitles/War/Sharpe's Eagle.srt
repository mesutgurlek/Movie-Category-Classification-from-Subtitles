1
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,590
(Dog barking)

2
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,750
I'm giving you a field commission, Sharpe.

3
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:19,070
From this moment on
you're a Lieutenant in the 95th

4
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,110
We need somebody
to command Dunnett's sharpshooters,

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,790
and Sharpe will be happier up in the mountains
than up in the mess.

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,030
All I know is how to fight.

7
00:00:28,120 --> 00:00:30,270
So, if there's any man amongst you

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,510
expecting a quick ramble through this war

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,550
now's the time

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,590
Bravo

11
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,630
I want you to have my sword.

12
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:53,230
Maybe if the men see you carry it...

13
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,550
They'll think I'm a proper officer.

14
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,340
- Morning, Lieutenant.
- Morning, miss. I hope you slept well.

15
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,390
I slept safely.

16
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:03,110
Thank you.

17
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,470
Now, there's a woman worth fighting dirty for, sir.

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,550
VIVAR: The gonfaon The banner of blood

19
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:22,990
Do you really believe
men will fight and die for a rag and a pole?

20
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,830
You do, Richard.

21
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,630
You do.

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,030
VIVAR: Sant'lago!

23
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,150
WELLESLEY: You did damn well Sharpe

24
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,510
Napoleon will be in a fearful rage
about Torrecastro, which is all to the good,

25
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:45,990
because next month I mean to cross into Spain,

26
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:49,390
and give Marshal Victor a damn good thrashing.

27
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,910
Stick with me, Richard. I'll see you right.

28
00:01:53,480 --> 00:01:55,430
You'll see me dead, sir.

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,470
(Chuckles) Oh, that's my boy!

30
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:29,350
HARPER: There were three lovely lassies
from Lisbon, Lisbon

31
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,710
Oh, Lisbon

32
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,750
There were three lovely lassies from Lisbon

33
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:38,070
- What? Harper?
- But Maggie was the belle...

34
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,390
Easy. Maggie the maggot's done the trick.

35
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,670
Your wound's as clean as a whistle.
You'll be running around in a week.

36
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,710
Sit up, now, and I'll give you a nice shave, sir.

37
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,030
(Splutters)

38
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,470
Eyes right!

39
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,990
What the devil's going on, Harper?

40
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,270
Ah, Nosey's being nice to the Spanish, sir.

41
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,430
If you ask me, he's planning a battle.

42
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,390
SHARPE: Damn this leg

43
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,230
should be down there
catching Wellesley's eye

44
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,710
I'll never get my promotion confirmed
lying in bed.

45
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,750
Now, now, sir. Hold steady.

46
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,190
Military march

47
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:23,470
- Must be a damned good book, Hogan.
- Shakespeare, sir.

48
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,510
Julius Caesar.

49
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,750
Mark Antony. "Lend me your ears," eh?

50
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,380
"These many, them shall die.

51
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:36,430
Their names are pricked."

52
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:44,800
By God, you may be sure my name is
well pricked by those needles at Horse Guards.

53
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,150
Ah. A general who wins battles
and lives to claim the credit

54
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,800
will never lack for enemies in London, sir.

55
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,710
And yet...

56
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:59,470
And yet they still behave
with their usual folly and weakness.

57
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,830
I have officers deserving commissions,

58
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:04,950
notably William Lawford

59
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,990
And what am I sent?

60
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,510
Flogged soldiers led by coffee-house
fops, commanded by dangerous buffoons.

61
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,550
Sir Henry Simmerson and the South Essex.

62
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,950
Quite so. I suspect he's been sent to spy on me.

63
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:27,230
Well, why not give him something to send back,
that will spoil their Lordships' supper?

64
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,510
Such as what, Hogan?

65
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,270
A victory, sir.

66
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,190
Small, but solid.

67
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,230
Small, but solid?

68
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,350
The bridge at Valdelacasa?

69
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,470
Mmm... something like that.

70
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,020
I could spare the South Essex,

71
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,470
but Sir Henry Simmerson isn't up to it.

72
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,230
No.

73
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:58,470
But Richard Sharpe is.

74
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,430
Richard Sharpe?

75
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,950
Let Sharpe do all the dirty work...

76
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,030
and Simmerson and that obnoxious nephew
of his get all the glory.

77
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,310
And if all does not go well?

78
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:21,470
Simmerson will have to keep quiet about it,
and you will have him in your power.

79
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,510
And if things go really badly?

80
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,830
We may lose a gallant officer.

81
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:28,510
Not Sharpe?

82
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:31,110
Oh, no, no.

83
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:33,760
BOTH: Simmerson.

84
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,790
Military march

85
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,310
South Essex... halt!

86
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,910
The South Essex, Hogan.

87
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,270
All mine.

88
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,910
Sir Henry!
Oh, sorry you've missed the parade, sir.

89
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,150
Damn it! Missed it, have we?

90
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,030
A dozen of the bastards

91
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,230
pretended to faint from the heat.
By God, I'll flog the fainting out of them!

92
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,630
- Drill them Mr. Denny
- Yes, sir.

93
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,670
Carry on, Drum Major!

94
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,390
Forward march!

95
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,350
Well, Hogan, what do you think of them?

96
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,230
A fine body of men, sir.

97
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,470
Sir Arthur warned me in advance
"Hogan" says he

98
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:38,190
"the South Essex is a sight to make you shiver."

99
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,830
His words.

100
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:44,590
Hm. I dare say he knows I have a cousin
who holds high office at Horse Guards.

101
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,190
Have you, by Jove?
Well, I hope you'll convey my respects to him,

102
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:50,430
at the conclusion of our mission, sir.

103
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,820
You mind me, Hogan, I'll mind you.

104
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,870
Make them jump to it, Mr. Denny!

105
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,190
I wonder how he keeps them looking so shiny.

106
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,990
He flogs them.

107
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,710
HARPER: I'm afraid you can't afford her sir

108
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,360
That bastard has bought her.

109
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,510
Same as he's bought his commission

110
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:28,350
Major, may I introduce the jewel in our crown?
Josefina, Countess La Costa.

111
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,350
Your servant, ma'am.

112
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,900
The late Count fell at Vimieiro.

113
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,460
You bear the loss with great fortitude, ma'am.

114
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:40,990
The Countess is traveling under the protection
of my nephew, Lieutenant Christian Gibbons.

115
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,750
This is his friend Lieutenant Berry

116
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:48,430
I must say,
that uniform does you credit, Mr. Gibbons.

117
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:51,670
Good God! Look at Dobbs dragging his feet.

118
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:54,350
Mr. Berry "At the double."

119
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,150
At the double, Mr. Denny!

120
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,990
DENNY: At the double!

121
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,780
Have pity, Sir Henry. They've been
marched sore in the hot sun all day.

122
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:05,030
No lectures from you, Major Lennox.

123
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:13,830
Mr. Berry,
75 lashes for Dobbs tomorrow morning,

124
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:16,790
when he can appreciate it
Lay them on Mr. Berry

125
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,430
I must protest...

126
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:23,070
By God, Lennox! I knew you were an old man
when I took you on, but not an old woman.

127
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,110
Speaking as a Virginian, sir,

128
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,430
I must say as how I don't hold
with flogging white men, sir.

129
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:33,630
My dear Captain Leroy, you may be a Loyalist,
but you are still an American.

130
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,950
You do not know the British soldier, sir.

131
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:38,670
He is a brute beast in a red coat.
He needs the lash!

132
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,550
Whip him in, Mr. Berry.

133
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,950
SIR HENRY: Must you go Hogan?

134
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,630
Fancy a brandy and a choice cigar?

135
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,420
Er... no, I hate to pass
on a brandy and a choice cigar,

136
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:55,110
Sir Henry, but... duty calls.

137
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,950
Servant, ma'am.

138
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,260
Gentlemen

139
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,950
No, come on, Jeremiah.
Let's go and have a wash.

140
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,950
Silly old sod!

141
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,660
You must indulge him, dear boy.
They say he has influence.

142
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,320
He may even have the ear of the King.

143
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,350
If Major Hogan makes his way up here,

144
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,000
we've got to show him
you're ready for action.

145
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,030
But I'm not ready for action.

146
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,030
I know that and you know that,
but we can't let that murderous old bugger know.

147
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,680
Pat. Richard.

148
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,310
- Good to see you, Major Hogan.
- Good to see you, Richard. How's the knee?

149
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,350
March up and down, boy.

150
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,550
Splendid. Splendid. Good man, Richard.
Up and about, what?

151
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,190
Yes, sir.

152
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,710
Pat's maggots did the trick, eh?

153
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,630
Where would the English be
if it wasn't for the Irish?

154
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,750
Me and Pat and Wellesley -

155
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,230
three Irish heroes
standing between Britannia and Bonaparte.

156
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,350
- Thank you, sir.
- Time you played your part, Richard.

157
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,390
Wellesley's worried about you.

158
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,500
"That fellow Sharpe, Hogan who saved my life
is that fellow still alive Hogan?"

159
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:15,110
"Alive and kicking," says I, quick at the repartee.

160
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,230
"Damn his impertinence!
Don't he know there's a war on?"

161
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:22,150
"He wants promotion, sir," says I,
again quick at the repartee.

162
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,230
He looks at me down his long nose.

163
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,430
"Hogan," says he,
"Hogan, tell Sharpe he'll never make captain

164
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,350
nursing his health " His very words

165
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,350
Give Lieutenant Sharpe a drink, Pat.
Best brandy.

166
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,870
Took it from the French at Oporto

167
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,070
Sit down, man. Sit down. You seem edgy.

168
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,390
Good show, Sir Henry!

169
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,430
Pretty sight

170
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,590
Spit it out, Major. What do you want?

171
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,070
Now, who said I wanted anything?

172
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,750
Well, let's just say I want your opinion.

173
00:13:02,360 --> 00:13:07,510
Sir Henry apart, the South Essex -
what do you make of them, man for man?

174
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,710
They're flogged soldiers, sir...

175
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,830
...and flogging teaches a soldier only one lesson.

176
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,870
And that is what, Richard?

177
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,070
How to turn his back.

178
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,990
Do you know anything about art, Richard?

179
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,910
Do you know Rubens?

180
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,950
Botticelli?

181
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,030
What the devil is it, sir?

182
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,070
It's a map of Spain.

183
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,230
Oh, sorry. It's upside down.
Makes no difference, either way!

184
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:45,030
Now, here...

185
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:48,270
we have the River Tagus.

186
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,750
And this is the town of Valdelacasa.

187
00:13:51,840 --> 00:13:55,670
There's a bridge here, not marked.
Wellesley wants us to destroy it.

188
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:58,550
Can you wave
in the general direction of the French?

189
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,350
Right here, Richard.

190
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,790
At the bridge.

191
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,470
You want me?

192
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,390
No. And you can't order me, sir.

193
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,270
Bad leg wound. The doctor says so.

194
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:20,550
Oh, well, that's a pity, now,
cos you'll miss a chance to see Teresa.

195
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,870
Teresa?

196
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,150
How?

197
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,550
Well, didn't I tell you that Teresa's been
looking after the French for me at Valdelacasa?

198
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:35,910
On top of that,
destroy that bridge at Valdelacasa,

199
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:40,230
and, mark my words,
it'll be Captain Richard Sharpe.

200
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,070
A captain. I'll drink to that.

201
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:54,270
Now, look, sir. The 95th are leaving for England,
apart from a few that are left here.

202
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,310
If General Wellesley wants me

203
00:14:56,400 --> 00:15:01,150
to go into country infested by French patrols,
grab a bridge,

204
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,190
and hold it long enough
for you to blow it to kingdom come,

205
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,350
well, then, sir,
I'll need a crack company of first-class men.

206
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:11,790
My dear boy, that's exactly what Sir Arthur said.

207
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,910
"Hogan" says he
"Sharpe will need a crack company"

208
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,950
"We don't have one," says I.

209
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,710
"Hogan, I don't care if you have to steal
the best regiment in the army,

210
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:24,550
but you find Sharpe his crack company."
His very words.

211
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,110
(Whispers) By God! I think he means it, Pat.

212
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:33,180
A company? Well, which one, sir?

213
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,870
The Coldstream Guards?

214
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:38,910
Never. Too much to hope for.

215
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,950
(Whispers) The Connaught Rangers.

216
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,910
The Connaught Rangers? Very steady.

217
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,590
Now, let's see. The 48th Foot, sir?

218
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,110
"March at night and fight at day."

219
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,470
By God, it's not the 48th, is it?

220
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,110
The South Essex, Sharpe.

221
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,790
(Sneezes)

222
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,950
SHARPE: Chosen Men! Back to barrack s!

223
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:10,110
Britches and boots on, you bloody idlers!

224
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,150
Where the blazes are they, Harper?

225
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,550
Whoring, sir. If I told them once,
I told them a thousand times not to go whoring.

226
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:20,070
"Boys," says I, "if you need
to hold on to something, hold a bottle."

227
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,110
Isn't that the best advice, sir?

228
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,950
You bloody old bishop!

229
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,590
What does it matter whether they're pissed
or poxed, so long as they can fight?

230
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,630
(Music and laughter)

231
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,780
Is that you, Tongue?

232
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,750
Where are they?

233
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:41,150
O, woe unto them that rise up
early in the morning and follow strong drink...

234
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:43,190
- all day.
- Oh, God!

235
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,270
Not now!

236
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,030
Jezebel.

237
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:55,070
(Clapping to fiddle music)

238
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,300
(Fires)

239
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,350
(Woman screams)

240
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,300
Clean them up.

241
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,390
I want them ready for the road tomorrow.

242
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,150
Sweat them, Sergeant.

243
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:23,870
Sweat them.

244
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,550
Harris, I'll have that.

245
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,190
God bless all here.

246
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:49,180
Right, lads. Fall in.

247
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,310
We've a bit of a bridge to blow up.

248
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:55,590
We... ain't going anywhere, sarge.

249
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,390
Anywhere?

250
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,270
Nee, sarge

251
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:04,480
We ain't going to get ourselves killed...
just so Sharpe can become a captain.

252
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:08,390
Besides, we've not been bloody well paid
for bloody well six weeks.

253
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,630
HARRIS: We're heading for Oporto

254
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,470
English ships loading wine - they'll take us.

255
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:16,150
I agree.

256
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:19,150
Well... I'll miss you.

257
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,190
So... that's it?

258
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:30,430
You don't want the son of a whore
to raise himself out of the dirt,

259
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,030
and stand the same height as Simmerson
and his no-good nephew?

260
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,830
Hm?

261
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,750
You want Sharpe to know his place,

262
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:44,270
the same way he knew your place
when you first joined the Rifles?

263
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,310
What were you?

264
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,350
Broken-down scribblers,

265
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:50,390
like Harris?

266
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,950
Poor little bastards like Perkins?

267
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,990
Bible-thumpers, like Tongue?

268
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,030
Poachers and picklocks
like Hagman and Cooper?

269
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:03,420
What were you?

270
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,670
Dust on a boot.

271
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,950
But look at you now.

272
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,750
Chosen Men.

273
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:14,230
Men who wear the white cord of courage.

274
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,830
Picked out and promoted

275
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,870
Why?

276
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,870
Because you didn't know your place.

277
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,030
Picked out cos you pushed to the front
and proved you were braver men

278
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,470
than those around you

279
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:32,910
Because you wanted to prove you were
better men than you were ever born to be

280
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,310
There's no sin in being born in the dirt boys

281
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,670
But it's a terrible sin to want to stay there.

282
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,670
Them's very dainty feet

283
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,590
you got there Cooper

284
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,980
Will they carry you as far as the bridge?

285
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,910
They'll carry me across the bridge.

286
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,950
And that's a promise, sarge.

287
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,910
You're living saints, all right.

288
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,110
God bless you, boys.

289
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:39,870
Men at the ready, Sergeant?

290
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,790
All the lads are fine, sir. Delighted, so they are.

291
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,310
Always glad to be having a crack at the French.

292
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:48,390
Nil desperandum. That's their motto, sir.

293
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,030
You're a lying sod, Harper.

294
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:55,390
One hour.

295
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,390
Yes, sir.

296
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,070
GIBBONS: Out of the way.

297
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,350
- You fellow what regiment?
- 95th.

298
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:14,230
I say, Berry old boy, this is one
of the ragamuffins we're taking with us tomorrow.

299
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,880
When an officer says "step aside",
you step aside.

300
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,910
Maybe this'll help you to remember.

301
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:26,260
Dangerous street for a lady, ma'am.
You should take a man with you.

302
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:47,950
Major Hogan, I have been struck
by a common soldier.

303
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:51,190
I believe the penalty
for striking an officer is death.

304
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,790
Death is the penalty for striking that officer.

305
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,550
That was Sharpe of the 95th.

306
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:58,230
What?
The ragamuffin that jumped from the ranks?

307
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,550
By God, I'll teach him to touch a gentleman.

308
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:04,310
I'll call him out, sir. I'll see him at dawn.

309
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,070
I'll second you, old boy.

310
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,540
A duel? Oh, give me your hand, sir.

311
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,670
You're a brave fellow, Gibbons.

312
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:12,790
Sharpe's a killer.

313
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:15,230
Killed three French and saved Wellesley's life.

314
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,270
Three seconds slash, cut, thrust.

315
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,350
And that's while he was still a sergeant.

316
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:23,270
Shall we say six o'clock tomorrow morning
in the field behind the camp?

317
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,390
Or shall we say it was damned dark,

318
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,430
and you made a damned bad mistake?

319
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,230
Silly mistake. Say no more about it, eh?

320
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,620
Good thinking, Gibbons.

321
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:38,990
Sharpe would have shot out your left eye
at a minute past six,

322
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,030
and you'd have spent tomorrow
looking at nothing with the other. (Chuckles)

323
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,670
Come on.

324
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,550
Ma'am.

325
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,510
Berry, old boy...

326
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,270
Don't worry, old boy. Sharpe is a dead man.

327
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:06,670
(Lash cracks)

328
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,710
(Soldier cries out)

329
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,070
(Moans)

330
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,830
SERGEANT 75: and a done sir

331
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,060
Parade, dismiss!

332
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,470
A pint of rum, Pat. Half-and-half.

333
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:58,870
Argh!

334
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,630
You're going to be all right, son.

335
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,910
Sharpe's special

336
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,350
A pint of best rum. Half-and-half.

337
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,670
Half in your belly...

338
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,390
...and half on your back.

339
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,310
Argh!

340
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,780
Sir Henry says it keeps the chin up.

341
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,430
There's better ways to keep a chin up.

342
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,990
Sharpe, isn't it?
Made a name for yourself in India.

343
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:44,950
Battle of Assaye, as I recollect.

344
00:24:45,040 --> 00:24:47,870
I was there myself with the 78th.

345
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:50,710
I Saw the 78th advance...

346
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,230
on their own.

347
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,830
The man who made a name for himself that day
was an officer of the 78th.

348
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,750
A man by the name of Lennox.

349
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:03,670
Aye, a long time ago.

350
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,910
Ah, I had a life's soldiering, then they retired me.

351
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,950
My wife died.

352
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,550
The South Essex was all I could get.

353
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,630
But thank you for reminding me
I was once a damned good soldier.

354
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:20,070
Now, wipe your boots.
I'll take you to meet a damned bad one.

355
00:25:22,840 --> 00:25:25,190
Well, bleed me, damn you, Parton!

356
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,750
This scarifier is the latest thing in London.

357
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:32,590
Do it

358
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,830
(Groans)

359
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,940
I always find a flogging brings on a spleen.

360
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,870
Do you find that too, Major Hogan?

361
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:56,300
Watching a flogging, Sir Henry, builds up
huge combustible gases in the internal organs.

362
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,870
Combustible gas, if confined,
will act like a charge

363
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:03,270
of blasting powder

364
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:05,310
Speaking as an engineer...

365
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:10,100
...I think it would be best to bleed you again.

366
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,190
Well, you heard him.
Do you think I want to burst? Bleed me.

367
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,350
(Groans)

368
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,900
SIR HENRY: and who the devil are you sir?
- Lieutenant Sharpe, sir.

369
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,950
No, you're not. You're a damned disgrace.

370
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,590
Get him a decent jacket.

371
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:31,030
No, sir.

372
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,950
This is the green jacket of my regiment, sir.
The 95th.

373
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,340
It is an honor to wear it
in any condition

374
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:41,190
What?! You are under my orders, sir.

375
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,110
With respect, Sir Henry, the situation is

376
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,510
that General Wellesley has placed Lieutenant
Sharpe and his men in my disposition.

377
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,390
But damn it, I am in command!

378
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:56,230
Well, it's because of that that General Wellesley
doesn't want to add to your responsibilities,

379
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,620
viz the South Essex, the march to Valdelacasa,

380
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:01,990
the relations with the Spanish allies

381
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,910
So much to do.

382
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:12,070
Also, there are certain exigencies of engineering
to which Lieutenant Sharpe is particularly suited.

383
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,990
Fetch and carry, eh?

384
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:18,310
Well, you may get to fight, too, Sharpe.

385
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,830
- Done any soldiering?
- A little, sir.

386
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,670
You look old for a lieutenant.

387
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,470
I came from the ranks, sir.

388
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,070
You mean you're not a gentleman?

389
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,470
No, sir.

390
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:37,390
By God, Sharpe! This will not do.
All my officers are gentlemen.

391
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:41,910
That being so, sir, I think we should
introduce ourselves like gentlemen.

392
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,310
Quite so, Captain Leroy. Quite so.

393
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,470
My name's Leroy.
Mighty pleased to meet you, Mr. Sharpe.

394
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,190
From America, sir?

395
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,950
No, sir. From Virginia.

396
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,830
Captain Leroy's
one of the brave American Loyalists

397
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,870
who refused to accept
the ravages of democracy,

398
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:04,230
and whose father fought for his King
against Washington

399
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,550
Washington won.

400
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:12,030
Fortunately, Captain Leroy
has ample means to console himself

401
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,660
- during his exile
- Slaves, cotton and molasses, sir.

402
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,320
All melted down into golden guineas.

403
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,700
I suppose I must introduce you

404
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,670
to Lieutenants Gibbons and Berry

405
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:26,630
I've met the young gentlemen, sir.

406
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,500
- I hope you know your place, Sharpe.
- You've made it very clear, sir.

407
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:34,430
Tell me. Who made you an officer?

408
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:36,310
Sir Arthur Wellesley, sir.

409
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:37,750
Wellesley? Ha

410
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,150
Wellesley don't know
what makes a good soldier. Not many do.

411
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,270
Do you know, Mr. Sharpe?

412
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,910
Yes, sir.

413
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,230
And what makes a good soldier, Sharpe?

414
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:52,620
The ability to fire three rounds a minute.

415
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,070
Three a minute?!

416
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,430
The South Essex can fire two on a good day.

417
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,830
You think you could do better, Mr. Sharpe?

418
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:03,470
Yes, sir.

419
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,510
You have until sunset, sir.

420
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,990
Any man who cannot fire three rounds a minute
will be flogged.

421
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:11,030
Carry on Sharpe

422
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,710
(Sighs)

423
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,580
It's all Wellesley's doing. Upstarts everywhere.

424
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:25,150
But no need to tell you that, Captain Leroy.

425
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:29,350
I'm told that in America common merit
counts for more than birth or wealth

426
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:32,190
Whoever told you that, sir...

427
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,230
is a goddamn liar.

428
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,230
Democracy or monarchy -
it don't make no difference.

429
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,550
Money talks.

430
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:45,870
Merit walks.

431
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,750
(Chuckles)

432
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,510
Send them to Ireland. We'd be free in a week.

433
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,710
(Gunshots)

434
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,990
Two rounds the minute, sir.

435
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,270
What the devil are you doing here?

436
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:38,310
Mr. Berry's orders, sir.

437
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:47,590
The French are over there...

438
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,630
waiting.

439
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,430
They fire three rounds a minute.

440
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,950
You fire two.

441
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,910
By sunset tomorrow, you'll all be dead.

442
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,630
Take off your jackets and stocks.

443
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,900
SHARPE: Bites the cartridge

444
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,270
pours the powder

445
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:35,580
spits the bet

446
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,950
(Spits)

447
00:31:37,040 --> 00:31:40,270
No ramrod.
Just a gentle tap of the butt to send it down.

448
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,310
Save 20 seconds.

449
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:46,670
The trick is... to keep the muzzle up
to stop the bloody bullet falling out.

450
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,270
(Laughter)

451
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:52,790
Of course,
the muzzle needs to point up anyway.

452
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,510
The Frog coming towards you
is high up on a horse.

453
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,470
(Harper fires)

454
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,070
Right... let's get to work.

455
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,110
Double ranks, Mr. Denny.

456
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,630
Double ranks!

457
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,310
And, Mr. Denny,

458
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,150
if you see any man
doing anything not in the manual...

459
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,830
Take his name sir?

460
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:14,380
Give him half a pint of rum on the spot,
Mr. Denny.

461
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,540
(Laughter)

462
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,030
Time this, Mr. Denny.

463
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,990
Tell them to load and fire in their own time.

464
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:32,510
Load and fire in your own time.

465
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,230
Load!

466
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,230
Bite, pour, spit, tap.

467
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,230
Aim.

468
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:06,030
Bite, pour, spit, tap, aim.

469
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,230
Steady, now, Dobbs. Bite.

470
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,470
Pour

471
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,030
Spit Tap

472
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:22,750
Do it again, Dobbs.

473
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,270
Cartridge. Bite.

474
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,830
Pour spit tap

475
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,630
Aim

476
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,550
Damn it, Josefina. I was worried about you.

477
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,510
Why?

478
00:33:35,600 --> 00:33:38,270
Did you think
that Mr. Sharpe had stolen me away?

479
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,710
Three shots and ten seconds in hand, sir.

480
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,310
Seven, six,

481
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:56,520
five, four, three, two, one.

482
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,470
Four shots the minute!

483
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:00,510
(Cheering)

484
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,710
Sharpe.

485
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:24,270
Yes, sir?

486
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,350
Stop showing off, Sharpe.

487
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,230
Yes, sir.

488
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,270
(Hagman sings)

489
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:53,590
Was set on Earth
for everyone quite equally to share

490
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:58,150
Some poacher bold, as I unfold

491
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:01,430
Keep up your gallant heart

492
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:04,870
Aye, and think about those poachers bold

493
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,670
That night in Rufford Park

494
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,400
Soldiering, sir! This is the life.

495
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,360
Fun, ain't it, Josefina?

496
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,710
Have you ever been in battle, Christian?

497
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,990
No. Hope to. Bloody good fun, eh?

498
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:32,030
I saw Vimieiro.

499
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,790
It made me cry.

500
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,500
Countess not co-operating, old boy?

501
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,750
I wish I knew what would please her.

502
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:48,790
Ask the maids.

503
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,990
What the blazes are you on about,
Berry, old boy?

504
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,310
Her name's Jacinta

505
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,960
had a bit of a fumble with her last night

506
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:01,510
- A bit out of the bottom drawer, eh?
- I'm not exactly top drawer myself, old boy.

507
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:07,340
The Countess owes her maids
two months' wages

508
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,150
I say, what say you lend me some tin
and I pay the maids?

509
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,910
I don't lend, old boy.
I'll play cards with you for three guineas.

510
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,950
Or you can touch your Uncle Henry.

511
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:20,110
Damn it, I touched him yesterday
to settle what I owed you.

512
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:23,070
Three guineas. Double or nothing tonight, eh?

513
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:26,590
SIR HENRY:
Captain Leroy tell Sharpe to get a move on

514
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,630
Madam.

515
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,430
Sorry about this, Sharpe.

516
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:42,060
Sir Henry's compliments,
and you're not to dawdle in the rear.

517
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:48,910
Right, lads. If we can't dawdle in the rear...

518
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:51,030
we may as well dawdle in the front.

519
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,030
Took the words out of my mouth, sir! (Chuckles)

520
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:57,870
War is as natural to man, sir, as...

521
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,310
as... er...

522
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,030
- As nature, sir?
- Uh?

523
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:06,150
Yes. As natural as nature.

524
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,310
- What the blazes?
- Quick time, sir.

525
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:23,270
The Rifle Regiment has only two marches
quick time and dawdle.

526
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:29,270
What have they brought the woman for?

527
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:31,390
Because they don't know any better.

528
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,230
Harris, Cooper, Hagman.

529
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,230
Don't miss, damn you.

530
00:37:56,320 --> 00:37:57,950
(Gunshots)

531
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,230
LENNOX: Sharpe! He's in trouble. Come on.

532
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:03,910
Come back at once, Major Lennox!
Sharpe brought it on himself, sir.

533
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:07,590
The South Essex will advance slowly
and with caution, Major Lennox.

534
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,020
Did you get them?

535
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:18,190
(Laughing)

536
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:20,350
Yes!

537
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,150
South Essex, halt!

538
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,510
Fall in, lads.

539
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,550
No dawdling, now.

540
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,710
He's making fools of us.

541
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,310
(Hogan chuckles)

542
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,310
Boys, who's for an apple?

543
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:26,510
(Laughing)

544
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:33,630
(Gunshot)

545
00:39:34,920 --> 00:39:37,590
SHARPE: Pay him
- How dare you, sir?

546
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:42,470
The Spanish are our allies, sir.
We do not loot comrades-in-arms.

547
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,790
Don't lecture me on allies, sir!

548
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,030
We're on our way
to meet a high-ranking Spanish colonel.

549
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:51,430
That's what I call an ally,
not some stinking peasant!

550
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:55,300
General Wellesley's orders
are to pay for all food and drink, sir.

551
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:58,870
Wellesley's a fool.
The French live off the land. Why not us?

552
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,950
You want to pay him, Mr. Sharpe?

553
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,990
Pay him from your own purse

554
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:21,470
I will pay.

555
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,510
This is between me and him, Countess.

556
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:36,070
- Cuánto vale, señor?
- Think you've got the tin, Sharpe?

557
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:39,550
Nada.

558
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,350
Is this nada too, eh? Eh, you rascal...

559
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,190
- Shoot the blackguard!
- Don't move, Sir Henry.

560
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,710
Sharpshooters sir

561
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,750
All aiming at you.

562
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,270
Who the devil's this?

563
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:13,060
Comandante Teresa
the leader of the guerrillas

564
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,270
The Spanish call her The Needle Don't ask why

565
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,510
Buenos dias, Comandante Teresa.

566
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:27,270
Let's go, Hogan. And get these fools out of here.

567
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,350
The man with the cart is Capitán Garcia,

568
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:32,390
the Commander of this region.

569
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:35,670
I am hoping he will join forces with me.

570
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:39,270
The guns were a token of goodwill.
Understand me?

571
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:43,190
Perfectly. A marriage of convenience.

572
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,430
Well, let's be on our way, Sir Henry.

573
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:51,300
(Clears throat) South Essex!

574
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,390
Follow me

575
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:57,630
Rifles, halt!

576
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,670
South Essex, halt!

577
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,510
We'll camp here tonight, Sir Henry.

578
00:43:04,600 --> 00:43:07,030
Destroy the bridge at dawn.

579
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,870
This evening we dine with the Spanish officers.

580
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:13,950
Teresa want you to keep Josefina company

581
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:17,350
And you'll need all your strength
for tomorrow.

582
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:19,390
That's an order.

583
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,710
(Tongue sings)

584
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:40,420
He will make good his right

585
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:44,060
To be a pilgrim

586
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:52,150
HAGMAN:
I will fly back home to the one that I love

587
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,110
And in her soft bosom

588
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,870
I would build me a nest

589
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:04,790
And pillow my head upon her lily-white breast

590
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:12,070
Where rifles crack and cannons swath

591
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:17,750
on a foreign field still call her name

592
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:25,270
and if am delivered as I hope to be

593
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:29,430
I shall sail home to England

594
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:34,670
and never part from thee

595
00:44:34,760 --> 00:44:37,320
SIR HENRY: Is Britannia afraid of Napoleon?

596
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,960
No sir Britannia is not

597
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,990
(Laughter)

598
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,950
- Fancy a fumble, old boy?
- Hm?

599
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:07,470
Well, you might as well have the maid,
since you can't have the mistress.

600
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,940
SIR HENRY: Deem it a great honor

601
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:16,220
as Commanding Officer of the South Essex,
in the presence of our gallant allies,

602
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,710
to acknowledge the auspicious portents
of our Anglo-Spanish alliance.

603
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,870
ALL Hear, hear! Bravo!

604
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:25,950
And it gives me great pleasure
to propose this toast.

605
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:29,870
Gentlemen, to His Most Catholic Majesty,

606
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,910
King Ferdinand VII.

607
00:45:33,360 --> 00:45:36,270
ALL King Ferdinand VII.

608
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:38,310
HOGAN: Hear, hear, Sir Henry.

609
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,190
Hear, hear. Bravo.

610
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,270
I'm going to get a bit of fresh air.

611
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:45,310
Good night, Major. Enjoy yourself.

612
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,950
I will.

613
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:51,350
I've laid ten guineas with Leroy
that Sir Henry will talk for a full hour.

614
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:54,910
Five minutes more and I'll have won my bet.

615
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:56,950
Bravo, Sir Henry! More, more, more.

616
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,990
Bad luck, old boy.

617
00:46:06,080 --> 00:46:08,950
Good night, Christian.

618
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,070
Lieutenant Berry.

619
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:13,190
BERRY: Good night, Countess, dear.

620
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,990
(Sir Henry continues taking)

621
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,830
Damn it!

622
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,070
Cards, old boy?

623
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,720
Afraid you've cleaned me out, Berry, old boy.

624
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,390
I've no luck at cards.

625
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,270
I've no luck in love.

626
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:40,110
Nothing left.

627
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,780
You have the Countess.

628
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,830
(Women arguing in Spanish)

629
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,070
BARRY: And the Countess has troubles.

630
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,230
What the devil are you on about, old boy?

631
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:56,830
I'll give you three guineas on her.

632
00:46:56,920 --> 00:47:00,350
You win, and you go and pay her maids.

633
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:03,190
I'm sure she'll show her gratitude.

634
00:47:03,280 --> 00:47:06,820
Ah... ah... what happens if you win, old boy?
Uh? Uh?

635
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:09,710
Then I go and pay her maids.

636
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:12,590
I say, Berry! You don't mean... er?

637
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:15,630
Cards, old boy?

638
00:47:21,720 --> 00:47:24,550
I was having a wee chat
with one of the maids, sir.

639
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,590
Jacinta. Nice girl.

640
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:30,670
But it seems Berry's been enjoying her favors.

641
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,230
It appears the Countess is a wee bit hard up, sir,

642
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:37,150
and, you know,
she wasn't born a countess at all,

643
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:40,910
but sort of worked her way up through the ranks.

644
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:42,950
So did I, Harper.

645
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,710
If Berry's tumbling the maid, sir...

646
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:51,950
he knows the Countess is in trouble.

647
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:09,310
Who goes there?

648
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:14,150
Beg pardon, ma'am.

649
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:17,400
(Sobs)

650
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:18,290
Countess...

651
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,630
Don't laugh at me

652
00:48:28,010 --> 00:48:29,300
I can get you a loan from Hogan

653
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:33,300
Does everybody know?

654
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:36,300
People are not sure

655
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:41,120
Show them the money, they will all keep quiet

656
00:48:43,290 --> 00:48:44,770
Why are you concerned?

657
00:48:45,530 --> 00:48:47,170
You have never had any money

658
00:48:47,870 --> 00:48:49,150
I did... but the French stole it from me

659
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:57,190
What do you want in return?

660
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,550
I want to see their faces when you
give them the money

661
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:04,430
Gibbons and Berry...

662
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:11,160
These Don Juans take advantage only
of women who have no money

663
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:15,730
Why do you try to hide your feelings?

664
00:49:18,420 --> 00:49:20,760
You're really very kind

665
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,510
(Laughing)

666
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,830
(Drunkenly) Hasta la mañana, señor!

667
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,830
(Both laughing)

668
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:39,190
Hasta mañana, señor!

669
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,670
SIR HENRY: Silly old buffoon

670
00:49:52,160 --> 00:49:54,110
Bad luck, old boy.

671
00:49:57,600 --> 00:50:00,950
JOSEFINA: No se olvida el dinero, señora.

672
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,260
I say, Berry, old chap...

673
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,470
Not backing down on a debt of honor?

674
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:13,870
What's that for, old boy?

675
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,630
The Countess has been very naughty.

676
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:21,340
Making eyes at Sharpe, making little of you.

677
00:50:21,440 --> 00:50:23,740
Making a fool of Sir Henry.

678
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,110
Calling herself a countess.

679
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:28,790
Very naughty indeed.

680
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:32,270
Naughty girls get spanked, and put to bed.

681
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:06,150
Eesa?

682
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:11,630
This...

683
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,590
or this?

684
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,630
SHARPE: How about this?

685
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,110
(Maids shriek)

686
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,670
(Berry chuckles)

687
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:04,190
What's got you boys all riled up?

688
00:52:04,280 --> 00:52:06,230
The honor of the South Essex, sir.

689
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:09,630
Berry unmasked this woman as an impostor
and asked her to leave.

690
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:13,310
This woman can't even pay her own servants

691
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:15,390
I want her out of the camp tonight!

692
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,430
Mr. Berry, see to it. Bag and baggage!

693
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,470
This woman is under my protection, sir.

694
00:52:22,560 --> 00:52:25,230
What?! How dare you, sir?

695
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,510
I hold an officer's commission.

696
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,710
It is both my right and my duty...

697
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:33,590
to take a woman in distress into my care.

698
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:34,950
He's got that right.

699
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:42,790
Only if he can pay for her protection.

700
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:45,150
Mr. Berry is right, Captain Leroy.

701
00:52:45,240 --> 00:52:48,150
Mr. Sharpe must pay the servants.

702
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,670
Hey, Mr. Sharpe.

703
00:52:56,680 --> 00:53:00,630
You dropped your purse when you was tussling
with the young gentleman.

704
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,870
Iros de mi vista.

705
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:23,510
Captain Leroy...

706
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:31,030
Slaves, cotton and molasses... sir.

707
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:35,110
I owe you a debt, Mr. Sharpe.

708
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,030
And I Leroy.

709
00:53:41,240 --> 00:53:43,190
Good night.

710
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,470
You are lucky to have him.

711
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:54,510
He is lucky to have me

712
00:54:09,800 --> 00:54:11,750
You risked a lot, defending her.

713
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:21,150
She is very beautiful.

714
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,550
She's a woman.

715
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:29,990
She needed help.

716
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:36,070
I could have killed him.

717
00:54:38,480 --> 00:54:42,150
I know what happens when soldiers run wild.

718
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:44,190
He will cause more trouble for her.

719
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:47,830
Not with you to protect her.

720
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:53,470
Promise me you will take care of her.

721
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,790
My job here is done.

722
00:54:55,880 --> 00:54:57,830
I've brought Garcia

723
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:00,950
and Major Hogan together.

724
00:55:01,040 --> 00:55:03,750
I'm leaving. Tomorrow.

725
00:55:07,280 --> 00:55:09,230
Stay with me.

726
00:56:05,360 --> 00:56:07,350
French infantry, sir.

727
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:19,830
Small patrol, sir. Just looking.

728
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,150
Ah, well, now.
We'll be giving them something to look at.

729
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,750
(Laughs) I say, Hogan!

730
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:35,710
Enemy in sight.

731
00:56:35,800 --> 00:56:38,950
Then let's get some prizes, dear boys. Hm?

732
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,070
- Major Lennox
- Sir?

733
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:46,150
You will take men and the Colors
and chase away those damned French.

734
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:50,110
But we are about to destroy the bridge,
and these are very green troops.

735
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,710
Do you disobey my orders, sir?

736
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,870
I have never disobeyed an order in my life, sir.

737
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,110
Mr. Denny.

738
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,110
Call out the guard.

739
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:04,420
Sir.

740
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,270
Turn out the guard!

741
00:57:22,360 --> 00:57:24,310
Right... face!

742
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,630
LENNOX: Halt.

743
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,670
Forward... march!

744
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,830
This is a fool's mission. Watch my flank, Sharpe.

745
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:29,470
DENNY: Halt!

746
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,830
Make Ready

747
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,110
Present. Fire!

748
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:47,150
(Battle cries)

749
00:58:47,240 --> 00:58:50,230
Watch the flank! The flank!

750
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:53,550
- French cavalry!
- Chosen Men!

751
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,390
- Destroy the bridge! Destroy the bridge!
- Goddamn!

752
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,830
(Neighing)

753
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,630
Hurry, damn you! Hurry!

754
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:03,310
Major Lennox

755
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:06,710
Argh!

756
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,270
(Shouting fades)

757
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:45,630
(Gunshot)

758
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,190
I lost the Colors.

759
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,710
(Lennox coughs)

760
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,750
I want an eagle.

761
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:59,230
An imperial eagle

762
01:00:59,320 --> 01:01:03,020
touched by the hand of Bonaparte himself.

763
01:01:03,120 --> 01:01:05,070
Hey, Sharpe.

764
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:09,870
It's got a brass point.

765
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:12,420
You push it in deep so I can feel it

766
01:01:19,000 --> 01:01:20,670
LEROY: An eagle?

767
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,110
Guess a dying man can dream.

768
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:35,470
At a place called Assaye...

769
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,030
...I saw a whole army ready to run.

770
01:01:41,560 --> 01:01:44,350
Then a major of the 78th

771
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:47,390
took a step to his front,

772
01:01:47,480 --> 01:01:49,430
and steadied the line

773
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:50,990
That's him

774
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,030
Major Lennox.

775
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,390
78th Highlanders.

776
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:08,830
I thought he was just an old man.

777
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,470
Sir... what will Mr. Sharpe do,

778
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:18,150
now that Major Lennox
has asked him for an eagle?

779
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:23,030
I didn't hear Sharpe say nothing about no eagle,
Mr. Denny, and neither did you.

780
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:27,590
Yes, sir. Sorry, sir.

781
01:02:27,680 --> 01:02:29,980
If you want to live, Mr. Denny,

782
01:02:30,080 --> 01:02:32,030
you stay away from Sharpe.

783
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,430
You've lost the Colors, sir.

784
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:57,470
The King's own Colors,

785
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,910
touched by his own hand

786
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:02,030
Take my advice and a pistol

787
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:07,030
and go behind that tent...
and blow out what's left of your brains.

788
01:03:22,640 --> 01:03:24,830
Permission to speak, sir.

789
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:28,430
- What is it, Harper?
- Would you take an order from me, sir?

790
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:32,510
- Well, what is it?
- Would you for the love of Jesus stand easy?

791
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,350
It's easy for you to say "stand easy",
Harper.

792
01:03:35,440 --> 01:03:37,670
Tell him. Just tell him the truth, sir.

793
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:39,670
Tell him that Simmerson cut and ran.

794
01:03:39,760 --> 01:03:43,630
You expect Wellington to take my word
against the word of Simmerson?

795
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,020
JOSEFINA: I...
HARPER: Look...

796
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:51,590
I have come to offer you my support, Mr. Sharpe,
if that is worth anything to you.

797
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:54,190
Thank you.

798
01:03:54,280 --> 01:03:57,750
Harper, would you escort the Countess inside?

799
01:03:57,840 --> 01:03:59,790
Happy to, sir.

800
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:05,350
Sir.

801
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:07,390
What are you going to do?

802
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:12,550
I'll do what I always do.

803
01:04:15,160 --> 01:04:17,110
I'll stand and fight.

804
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:31,390
Continue, Sir Henry.

805
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:36,270
Well, sir, on first sighting the French,
I naturally gave the order to advance.

806
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,310
That's my style, sir.

807
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,710
The South Essex crossed over the bridge
and engaged the enemy.

808
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:46,740
Major Lennox panicked so then I fell back
in good order and destroyed the bridge sir

809
01:04:52,280 --> 01:04:55,230
(Clears throat)
I have written to Horse Guards, sir,

810
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,790
to state that the South Essex
acquitted itself most commendably,

811
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:02,030
in discharging both your general orders
to engage the enemy,

812
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:04,710
and your particular order to destroy the bridge.

813
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,750
(Clears throat)

814
01:05:08,440 --> 01:05:10,870
Did any officer distinguish himself?

815
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,500
Lieutenant Gibbons led the advance, sir.

816
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:17,710
You may say that he is tied to me by blood.

817
01:05:17,800 --> 01:05:21,910
But is it a tie of blood to tie my tongue
and rob a brave man of his just reward?

818
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:23,870
No sir

819
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:27,150
recommend
Lieutenant Gibbons be gazetted Captain sir

820
01:05:27,240 --> 01:05:29,990
And Lieutenant Sharpe?

821
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:35,230
Lieutenant Sharpe dithered, sir.
He was cut off when we destroyed the bridge.

822
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:38,030
This is a report from Major Hogan,

823
01:05:38,120 --> 01:05:41,350
which differs somewhat from your account,
Sir Henry.

824
01:05:41,440 --> 01:05:43,710
Major Hogan is merely an engineer, sir.

825
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:49,670
Major Hogan's coat buttons up tight
over a number of other duties, Sir Henry.

826
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:55,750
Major Hogan reports a number of losses
Sir Henry

827
01:05:55,840 --> 01:06:01,070
He says you first lost your head, and instead
of destroying the bridge, marched over it.

828
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:04,470
He says you then lost your nerve
and ran from a small French patrol.

829
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,510
He says you lost ten men,

830
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,750
a major and two sergeants

831
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:14,460
He says you finally lost your sense of honor
and destroyed the bridge,

832
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,510
cutting off a rescue party

833
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,550
led by Lieutenant Sharpe

834
01:06:20,520 --> 01:06:23,830
Major Hogan leaves the worst to the last

835
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,180
He says you lost the King's Colors.

836
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,190
The fault was not mine, sir.

837
01:06:31,280 --> 01:06:33,190
Major Lennox must answer.

838
01:06:33,280 --> 01:06:35,430
Major Lennox answered with his life,

839
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:39,140
as you should have done,
if you had any sense of honor!

840
01:06:39,240 --> 01:06:42,230
You lost the Colors of the King of England

841
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:44,830
You disgraced us sir You shamed us sir

842
01:06:46,200 --> 01:06:48,430
You will answer

843
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:56,630
The South Essex is stood down in name.

844
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,870
If I wipe the name, I may wipe the shame.

845
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,390
I am making you a battalion of detachments.

846
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:05,230
You will fetch and carry

847
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:07,590
The Light company put up a fight

848
01:07:07,680 --> 01:07:11,380
so I will let it stand
under the command of a new captain.

849
01:07:13,040 --> 01:07:18,310
To be commanded
by the newly gazetted Captain Gibbons, sir?

850
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:22,550
To be commanded
by the newly gazetted Captain Sharpe, sir.

851
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:31,910
I have a cousin at Horse Guards, sir...

852
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:35,870
...and I have friends at Court.

853
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,790
The man who loses the King's Colors...

854
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,830
loses the King's friendship

855
01:07:45,280 --> 01:07:47,990
You have two choices.

856
01:07:48,080 --> 01:07:50,990
To hide in England or be a hero in Spain.

857
01:07:51,080 --> 01:07:53,030
I shall help you to be a hero.

858
01:07:54,360 --> 01:07:58,390
We had a skirmish with the French today
Tomorrow we shall have a battle

859
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:02,790
You will be the first to see a French column sir
t is not a pretty sight

860
01:08:02,880 --> 01:08:04,830
What you do then, sir, is up to you.

861
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,110
Good morning.

862
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,820
Listen, and listen well.

863
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,460
You both dip into my purse.
That purse is now shut.

864
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:35,710
It will stay shut so long as Sharpe struts around
sneering at the Simmersons.

865
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:37,750
You understand me?

866
01:08:37,840 --> 01:08:39,790
Leave Sharpe to me, sir.

867
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,750
Sharpe...

868
01:08:59,840 --> 01:09:03,070
I can make you a captain,
but I cannot keep you a captain.

869
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,950
There is talk about an imperial eagle Sharpe

870
01:09:08,040 --> 01:09:11,270
There is talk of a promise
made to the ate Major Lennox

871
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:14,630
Tell me on oath that the talk is just idle gossip,
Sharpe,

872
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:18,870
or by God, sir, I promise
you will walk out of that door a lieutenant.

873
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:21,520
Sea a

874
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:26,430
that no-one heard me make any promise
in respect of an imperial eagle to Major Lennox.

875
01:09:30,240 --> 01:09:32,350
- Colonel Lawford.
- Sir?

876
01:09:32,440 --> 01:09:36,870
You may escort Captain Sharpe to the door,
Colonel Lawford.

877
01:09:36,960 --> 01:09:38,870
Yes, sir.

878
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,910
Thank you, sir.

879
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,900
Hogan...

880
01:09:53,000 --> 01:09:57,110
let the French know that the fool
who lost the Colors is holding our flank.

881
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,760
But, sir, that means sending a French column...

882
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:02,350
If Hogan's spies can spin a good yarn...

883
01:10:05,440 --> 01:10:08,190
Major Lennox was a damn fine officer.

884
01:10:12,720 --> 01:10:16,790
Did I ever tell you the story
of how he steadied the line at Assaye, Hogan?

885
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:19,870
No, sir.

886
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:21,830
You're a damned liar Hogan

887
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:24,030
(Hogan sniffs)

888
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:26,070
That's what you pay me for, sir.

889
01:10:27,320 --> 01:10:28,790
(Sneezes)

890
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:31,260
Join me for a drink.

891
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:35,270
No. I've got to lick the remnants
of the South Essex into shape.

892
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:37,310
Watch out for Simmerson, Richard.

893
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,110
Simmerson? Simmerson's a fool.

894
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:42,030
No hes a coward, not a fool

895
01:10:42,120 --> 01:10:44,470
You make one mistake... You heard Wellesley?

896
01:10:44,560 --> 01:10:46,230
- I heard him.
- Good.

897
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:48,270
Well, don't brood by yourself.

898
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:53,670
It's a poor substitute, but if you can't be with her,
you might as well be with your friends.

899
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:57,670
For an intelligence officer,
Hogan's got a loose mouth.

900
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,910
Well, he asked me to keep an eye on you.

901
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:02,030
I'll see you in the mess this evening.

902
01:11:06,440 --> 01:11:08,710
Are you and the young Lord twins, or what?

903
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,870
We spent three months chained in a cell in India.

904
01:11:17,080 --> 01:11:19,830
He had a page of the Bible.

905
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,790
In three months,
he taught me how to read and write.

906
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:28,310
How can you pay back a man who teaches you
to write your own name, Captain?

907
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,270
I say, old chap. Let's have some fun, eh?

908
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:43,110
A duel.

909
01:11:45,960 --> 01:11:47,750
What's that, old boy?

910
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:51,190
Nobody can beat me with a pistol at 50 paces.

911
01:11:51,280 --> 01:11:54,870
I've got to make Sharpe call me out. A duel.

912
01:11:54,960 --> 01:11:56,910
Bloody Wellesley don't allow it.

913
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:58,950
So Sharpe loses even if he wins.

914
01:12:02,680 --> 01:12:04,630
You want a woman, old boy.

915
01:12:06,040 --> 01:12:08,390
Do I?

916
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,430
You know who I want.

917
01:12:10,520 --> 01:12:12,470
That's the woman I had in mind.

918
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,030
Let's call on the Countess, old boy.

919
01:12:17,760 --> 01:12:19,990
That's a good idea.

920
01:12:20,080 --> 01:12:22,270
What about Sharpe?

921
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,310
Sharpe's away playing soldiers.

922
01:12:26,160 --> 01:12:27,710
Snap.

923
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:39,150
Those men who've fought in a big battle before...

924
01:12:39,240 --> 01:12:41,190
one pace forward.

925
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,630
This place is called Talavera.

926
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,550
There's going to be a battle here tomorrow.

927
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,470
You'll fight in it,

928
01:12:57,560 --> 01:13:00,550
maybe even die in it

929
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,710
But you won't see it.

930
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:04,470
(Explosions)

931
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:08,230
There's a lot of smoke in a battle.

932
01:13:08,320 --> 01:13:10,310
Our cannon, their cannon.

933
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,430
Our shot their shell

934
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,230
Our volleys, their volleys.

935
01:13:17,440 --> 01:13:19,710
You don't see a battle.

936
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,750
You hear it.

937
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:24,400
Black powder blasting by the ton on all sides.

938
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,310
Back smoke binding you and choking you

939
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,750
and making you vomit

940
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,430
and the French come out of the smoke

941
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:37,110
Not in a line but in a column

942
01:13:37,200 --> 01:13:39,830
And they march towards our thin line,

943
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:43,990
kettledrums hammering like hell,
and a golden eagle blazing overhead.

944
01:13:45,520 --> 01:13:47,470
They march slowly,

945
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:50,670
and it takes them a long time to reach you

946
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:53,110
and you can't see them in smoke

947
01:13:53,200 --> 01:13:55,910
but you can hear the drums

948
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:58,910
They march out of the smoke
and you fire a volley

949
01:13:59,000 --> 01:14:01,070
and the front rank of the column falls

950
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:04,430
and the next rank steps over them,
with drums hammering.

951
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:08,990
And the column smashes your line,
like a hammer breaking glass,

952
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:11,460
and Napoleon has won another battle.

953
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,150
But if you don't run

954
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,190
if you stand

955
01:14:17,280 --> 01:14:19,110
until you can smell the garlic

956
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:23,310
and fire volley after volley
three rounds a minute

957
01:14:23,400 --> 01:14:26,110
then they slow down,

958
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,150
they stop,

959
01:14:28,240 --> 01:14:30,750
and then they run away.

960
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:34,190
A you've got to do is stand

961
01:14:34,280 --> 01:14:36,790
and fire three rounds a minute

962
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:40,030
Now, you and I know
you can fire three rounds a minute.

963
01:14:43,840 --> 01:14:46,190
But can you stand?

964
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,990
Hola, cariño. Quieres pasar un buen rato?
Mira lo que tu pierdes.

965
01:15:02,760 --> 01:15:04,710
Sorry, sir. Sorry.

966
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:12,350
Bad business, Sharpe.
Berry and Gibbons were here, with a riding crop.

967
01:15:12,440 --> 01:15:15,590
They got out of the window
when they heard us on the stairs.

968
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:17,630
She's all right, Sharpe.

969
01:15:27,560 --> 01:15:29,510
(Josefina hums)

970
01:15:41,880 --> 01:15:43,830
Josefina...

971
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:47,070
(Hums)

972
01:15:52,480 --> 01:15:55,070
They treated me like an animal.

973
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,790
But they could not make me do
what they wanted.

974
01:16:08,680 --> 01:16:10,910
We have to stop him.

975
01:16:11,000 --> 01:16:13,030
You can't stop Captain Sharpe, sir.

976
01:16:13,120 --> 01:16:15,500
You can walk away from him
or stand behind him,

977
01:16:15,600 --> 01:16:17,630
but don't ever try and get in his way.

978
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:27,070
I give you Colonel William Lawford,
one of the future leaders of our great regiment.

979
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:29,720
Colonel... William... Lawford!

980
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:31,750
(Cheering and clapping)

981
01:16:34,360 --> 01:16:36,710
Disgusting Irish bogtrotter.

982
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:39,750
Do you know, Uncle, I don't think Lawford is Irish.

983
01:16:43,960 --> 01:16:46,470
So, what's happening with Sharpe?

984
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:49,550
Oh, that's all in hand, Sir Henry.

985
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:53,790
And I have to say,
it was an absolute pleasure to arrange.

986
01:16:55,200 --> 01:16:56,550
Good.

987
01:16:56,640 --> 01:16:58,590
OFFICER: I say, old man!

988
01:17:10,400 --> 01:17:11,750
Drink, sir?

989
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,750
Thank you.

990
01:17:21,320 --> 01:17:23,880
I don't fight duels over whores.

991
01:17:35,440 --> 01:17:36,870
I do.

992
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,990
Sharpe just threw away his promotion.

993
01:17:50,480 --> 01:17:53,150
My orders are perfectly clear, Lawford.

994
01:17:53,240 --> 01:17:55,350
Dueling is strictly forbidden.

995
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:58,470
I shall make no exception
in respect of Captain Sharpe.

996
01:17:58,560 --> 01:18:02,830
If he fights Berry at dawn, he will be back
among the ranks before the sun is up.

997
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:05,630
There is no more to say, sir.

998
01:18:05,720 --> 01:18:07,670
Yes, sir.

999
01:18:13,160 --> 01:18:15,110
French hopping about a bit, Hogan?

1000
01:18:15,200 --> 01:18:16,790
Yes, sir.

1001
01:18:16,880 --> 01:18:20,390
Send out a patrol to take a look. Not too big.

1002
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,430
Eight men, two officers.

1003
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:25,710
I have done so, sir. About an hour ago.

1004
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,860
Captain Sharpe and Lieutenant Berry.

1005
01:18:32,880 --> 01:18:34,830
That should do the trick, Hogan.

1006
01:19:02,560 --> 01:19:04,510
We're a long way from home, sir.

1007
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,430
Argh!

1008
01:19:33,480 --> 01:19:35,430
(Gasps for breath)

1009
01:19:49,760 --> 01:19:51,710
(Groans)

1010
01:19:58,240 --> 01:19:59,790
(Gun clicks)

1011
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:11,790
Running back to show them the hero's wound,
dear boy?

1012
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,590
Argh!

1013
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:16,950
I've decided not to wait till dawn.

1014
01:20:17,040 --> 01:20:19,150
I'm going to kill you tonight.

1015
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:22,270
But there's no hurry

1016
01:20:22,360 --> 01:20:24,390
want to hear you beg for mercy first

1017
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:27,710
So I'm going to kick you again.

1018
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:29,430
Argh!

1019
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:30,550
And again.

1020
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:36,260
And then you can beg

1021
01:20:36,360 --> 01:20:39,390
This is going to hurt quite a bit, old boy.

1022
01:20:39,480 --> 01:20:42,550
HARPER: So will this, old boy.
- Agh!

1023
01:20:47,960 --> 01:20:51,030
O my God,
I am heartily sorry for having offended thee.

1024
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:54,870
I firmly resolve, with the help of thy grace,
nevermore to offend thee,

1025
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:57,910
but to amend my life. Amen.

1026
01:20:58,000 --> 01:21:00,590
He won't be able to, Harper.

1027
01:21:00,680 --> 01:21:02,630
Able to what, sir?

1028
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:04,670
Amend his life.

1029
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,710
He hasn't time.

1030
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:12,070
Maybe you're right.
He'll hardly be needing this, so...

1031
01:21:12,160 --> 01:21:14,910
Leroy gets his loan back.

1032
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:16,950
What'll I do with him?

1033
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,230
Stick him behind the French pickets.

1034
01:21:19,320 --> 01:21:21,590
He'll be among the glorious dead tomorrow.

1035
01:21:25,160 --> 01:21:27,950
I think he's gone off, sir.

1036
01:21:28,040 --> 01:21:31,510
That bastard was gone off
even when he was alive.

1037
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:33,550
Brandy.

1038
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:44,670
# Here's forty shillings on the drum

1039
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:47,750
# For those who'll volunteer to come

1040
01:21:47,840 --> 01:21:51,750
# To 'list and fight the French today

1041
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:55,270
# Over the hills and far away

1042
01:21:56,400 --> 01:22:00,430
ALL: # O'er the hills and o'er the main

1043
01:22:00,520 --> 01:22:05,030
# Through Flanders, Portugal and Spain

1044
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:08,430
# King George commands, and we obey

1045
01:22:08,520 --> 01:22:10,070
# Over the hills

1046
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:13,670
# And far away...

1047
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,710
What are you doing down here, sir?

1048
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,360
You should be up in the mess
with your own kind.

1049
01:22:19,720 --> 01:22:22,100
They're not my own kind, Harper.

1050
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:24,790
The lads want to toast your promotion, sir.

1051
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:27,510
Oh, I haven't got the stomach for it.

1052
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:31,070
We're fighting the French tomorrow.
We could all get killed.

1053
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:36,070
Would you not just put her out of your mind
for one night?

1054
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:39,230
And what man is there

1055
01:22:39,320 --> 01:22:42,590
that hath betrothed a wife
and has not taken her?

1056
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,590
Let him go...

1057
01:22:44,680 --> 01:22:49,470
and return unto his house, lest he die in battle...
and another man take her.

1058
01:22:51,360 --> 01:22:53,310
That's Deuteronomy

1059
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:56,230
There's a woman outside
looking for Captain Sharpe, sir.

1060
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:04,590
Oh, every cripple has his own way of walking.

1061
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:07,630
# O'er the hills and o'er the main

1062
01:23:08,680 --> 01:23:13,070
# Through Flanders, Portugal and Spain

1063
01:23:13,160 --> 01:23:16,910
# King George commands, and we obey

1064
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:21,070
# Over the hills and far away...

1065
01:23:27,400 --> 01:23:29,350
Teresa.

1066
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,350
Is it true?

1067
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,590
Is it true that tomorrow
you will try to take a French eagle?

1068
01:23:39,680 --> 01:23:42,240
Lennox died at the bridge.

1069
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:46,350
We lost the Colors.

1070
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,390
And I thought you had more sense.

1071
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,790
And I thought you knew me better.

1072
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,030
You think it's funny to die for an eagle?

1073
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,070
I am a soldier.

1074
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:00,910
Would you care...

1075
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:02,910
if I died?

1076
01:24:03,000 --> 01:24:06,950
Yes.

1077
01:24:17,680 --> 01:24:19,790
Then I shall take care not to.

1078
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,470
God, Hogan.

1079
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:45,430
Horse, foot, cannon.

1080
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,430
The French outnumber us three to one.

1081
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:50,470
Does he know something I don't?

1082
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:54,150
He knows three things, Lawford. He knows

1083
01:24:54,240 --> 01:24:58,020
that on his right
the French will not attack the fort

1084
01:24:58,120 --> 01:25:00,110
He knows that on his left

1085
01:25:00,200 --> 01:25:02,660
Simmerson will run

1086
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:05,140
and in the center he knows

1087
01:25:05,240 --> 01:25:07,310
that Daddy Hi will stand

1088
01:25:09,240 --> 01:25:11,430
Means nothing to me, either, Lawford.

1089
01:25:11,520 --> 01:25:14,080
That's why he's a general and we ain't

1090
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,590
What are your intentions, Sir Arthur?

1091
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:19,510
Why, Hogan...

1092
01:25:19,600 --> 01:25:22,630
I mean to give the French
a damn good thrashing.

1093
01:25:22,720 --> 01:25:24,670
(Cannon fire)

1094
01:25:39,880 --> 01:25:41,670
Hot work, lads.

1095
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,750
It were worse yesterday,
when you let off the cannon.

1096
01:25:44,840 --> 01:25:46,790
Ah, you're a bloody liar, Dobbs.

1097
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:49,790
Brooding on poor Berry, dear boy?

1098
01:25:49,880 --> 01:25:53,630
Death of a hero.
We must all hope to die so bravely.

1099
01:25:55,880 --> 01:25:57,830
What the devil's that?

1100
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,910
(Soldiers chanting)

1101
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:10,710
Vive l'Empereur! Vive l'Empereur!

1102
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:13,470
Vive l'Empereur!

1103
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:15,710
Gosh! Oh, my God!

1104
01:26:15,800 --> 01:26:17,950
South Essex, fall back, fall back!

1105
01:26:21,240 --> 01:26:25,310
South Essex... stand!

1106
01:26:33,160 --> 01:26:34,910
SHARPE: Steady, lads!

1107
01:26:35,000 --> 01:26:36,950
Steady!

1108
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:42,350
Vive l'Empereur!

1109
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:46,230
Vive l'Empereur!

1110
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,830
Now, I know you can fire three rounds a minute...

1111
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,390
...but what I want to know now...

1112
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:57,590
...is can you stand?

1113
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:03,070
(Cheering)

1114
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:07,710
Vive l'Empereur! Vive l'Empereur!

1115
01:27:07,800 --> 01:27:09,510
Three rounds a minute, Captain Leroy.

1116
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,870
Chosen Men, to me!

1117
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:14,420
Hey, where are you boys going?

1118
01:27:14,520 --> 01:27:18,220
Hey! Denny, you come back here! You hear?

1119
01:27:21,560 --> 01:27:22,700
Goddamn!

1120
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,190
Boys, let's load up and do some shootin'.

1121
01:27:39,320 --> 01:27:41,550
Vive l'Empereur!

1122
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:43,590
First rank, fire!

1123
01:27:45,160 --> 01:27:46,630
One.

1124
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,670
It'll take six to stop them.

1125
01:27:48,760 --> 01:27:51,390
Vive l'Empereur! Vive l'Empereur!

1126
01:27:51,480 --> 01:27:53,780
Second rank, fire!

1127
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:55,670
- Two.
- Reload

1128
01:27:55,760 --> 01:27:59,540
- Vive l'Empereur!
- First rank, fire!

1129
01:28:00,280 --> 01:28:04,750
- (Screaming)
- Second rank, fire!

1130
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,150
Y'all doing real good, boys!

1131
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:13,190
First rank fire

1132
01:28:16,520 --> 01:28:20,030
Vive l'Empereur! Vive l'Empereur!

1133
01:28:24,160 --> 01:28:25,110
Reload!

1134
01:28:26,200 --> 01:28:27,750
Second rank...

1135
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,260
...fire!

1136
01:28:30,360 --> 01:28:32,150
Reload!

1137
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,990
First rank, fire!

1138
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:39,870
Free and easy, boys! Fire!

1139
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:43,630
Fire!

1140
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,830
Chosen Men!

1141
01:28:49,600 --> 01:28:51,550
(Battle cries)

1142
01:28:56,920 --> 01:28:58,670
Whoo! They're runnin', boys!

1143
01:29:06,160 --> 01:29:07,430
Yar-har!

1144
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:33,990
(Groans)

1145
01:30:17,000 --> 01:30:18,950
(Coughs)

1146
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:23,670
Goddammit, Denny!
I told you to stay away from him.

1147
01:30:39,520 --> 01:30:42,270
- Dobbs.
- Sir?

1148
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:44,310
Like to join the Rifles, Dobbs?

1149
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,030
That I would, sir.

1150
01:30:47,120 --> 01:30:49,070
It's a good life...

1151
01:30:50,280 --> 01:30:52,230
...if you can stay alive.

1152
01:31:10,880 --> 01:31:14,420
HOGAN: We done sir
What a pounding the South Essex gave them

1153
01:31:14,520 --> 01:31:16,470
and the advance of the 48tn

1154
01:31:16,560 --> 01:31:18,750
Talavera will be the talk of London, sir.

1155
01:31:18,840 --> 01:31:20,790
- Hogan...
- Sir?

1156
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:23,910
- Did he?
- Yes, sir.

1157
01:31:24,000 --> 01:31:27,150
Pity Lennox ain't here to see it.

1158
01:31:27,240 --> 01:31:29,470
Damned fine officer, Major Lennox.

1159
01:31:50,160 --> 01:31:52,110
JOSEFINA: Richard.

1160
01:31:59,880 --> 01:32:01,790
Did we...

1161
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:03,790
Did Wellesley...

1162
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:06,260
Yes, he won.

1163
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:08,310
He won so well, they made him a lord.

1164
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,150
Lord Wellington.

1165
01:32:16,160 --> 01:32:18,110
I came to say goodbye, Richard.

1166
01:32:21,920 --> 01:32:25,590
What will you do? Where will you go?

1167
01:32:28,160 --> 01:32:30,110
Captain Leroy has been very kind.

1168
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:33,670
I'm leaving for Lisbon today.

1169
01:32:36,000 --> 01:32:39,620
Vaya con Dios, Josefina.

1170
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:09,980
Why?

1171
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:12,310
I wanted to be confirmed Captain.

1172
01:33:15,240 --> 01:33:17,190
I needed an eagle to be certain.

1173
01:33:18,640 --> 01:33:21,200
Young Denny...

1174
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,030
dead.

1175
01:33:23,120 --> 01:33:26,790
All the others. All that blood.

1176
01:33:26,880 --> 01:33:28,830
For an eagle?

1177
01:33:28,920 --> 01:33:32,590
Slaves, cotton and molasses, you said.

1178
01:33:33,760 --> 01:33:35,710
Slaves bleed

1179
01:33:36,880 --> 01:33:39,590
All that black blood to fill a purse, sir?

1180
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:01,380
I figured...

1181
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:03,430
I figured maybe...

1182
01:34:05,800 --> 01:34:07,750
...you had another reason.

1183
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,030
Shave, sir?

1184
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:23,790
Water.

1185
01:34:23,880 --> 01:34:27,310
Water?
Jeez, you'll be asking me for brandy next.

1186
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:33,150
(Spits)

1187
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:35,190
Brandy, sir.

1188
01:34:35,280 --> 01:34:38,820
Get that into you,
and you'll be fit for an Irish funeral!

1189
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:49,310
Sharpe.

1190
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:52,790
Major Hogan.

1191
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:58,470
As from noon today, Colonel Lawford
will be the beneficiary of Simmerson's folly.

1192
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:00,820
Sir?

1193
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:04,590
He will take over acting command
of the South Essex.

1194
01:35:05,720 --> 01:35:07,030
And Simmerson?

1195
01:35:08,680 --> 01:35:12,380
War Office whitewash.
Exoneration and a blind eye.

1196
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:14,430
Are you keeping well, Richard?

1197
01:35:14,520 --> 01:35:17,230
Aye. I'm mending.

1198
01:35:17,320 --> 01:35:19,070
Why?

1199
01:35:20,440 --> 01:35:23,030
Richard... Richard...

1200
01:35:24,880 --> 01:35:29,470
Your mind has been making appointments
your body should never keep.

1201
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:32,510
What do you mean by that, sir?

1202
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:37,030
You have ambition,
which could be the making of you.

1203
01:35:37,120 --> 01:35:39,070
But you also have a romantic soul,

1204
01:35:39,160 --> 01:35:42,630
which could be the breaking of you.

1205
01:35:42,720 --> 01:35:45,150
Ambition and romance is a poisonous brew...

1206
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:49,910
...and I mean to distil the one from the other.

1207
01:35:51,240 --> 01:35:53,700
Are you questioning my loyalty, sir?

1208
01:35:53,800 --> 01:35:55,990
I would stand it against yours

1209
01:35:56,080 --> 01:35:59,950
Or is it that you see something in me
that you've lost in yourself?

1210
01:36:00,040 --> 01:36:03,660
Oh, believe me, Richard. I've drunk of the cup

1211
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:06,950
and its intoxication I can well remember.

1212
01:36:08,160 --> 01:36:10,110
I can hold my drink, sir.

1213
01:36:11,240 --> 01:36:14,070
See that you do, Sharpe.

1214
01:36:14,160 --> 01:36:16,110
See that you do.

1215
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:47,180
Well, you lived.

1216
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:48,830
Just about.

1217
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:51,220
You got what you wanted?

1218
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:53,270
Oh, yes. I did.

1219
01:36:55,720 --> 01:36:57,070
And you?

1220
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:00,270
What do you want?

1221
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:03,310
Me?

1222
01:37:03,400 --> 01:37:06,110
I want life to be simple again.

1223
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,150
Simple?

1224
01:37:09,480 --> 01:37:11,430
What do you mean, simple?

1225
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,310
Me. Alone.

1226
01:37:15,400 --> 01:37:17,190
That simple.

1227
01:37:18,320 --> 01:37:20,270
So you want to be alone?

1228
01:37:21,680 --> 01:37:23,230
No.

1229
01:37:25,080 --> 01:37:26,830
Neither do I.

1230
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:42,230
(Teresa laughs)

1231
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,590
HARPER: Shoulder... arms!

1232
01:38:30,120 --> 01:38:32,070
Present!

1233
01:38:34,960 --> 01:38:36,510
Fire!

1234
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:39,510
Shoulder... arms!

1235
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:44,390
Rifles... left face!

1236
01:38:46,040 --> 01:38:47,990
Forward... march.

1237
01:38:50,320 --> 01:38:54,020
HAGMAN: # Here's forty shillings on the drum

1238
01:38:54,120 --> 01:38:57,590
# For those who'll volunteer to come

1239
01:38:57,680 --> 01:39:01,300
# To 'list and fight the foe today

1240
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:04,870
# Over the hills and far away

1241
01:39:06,040 --> 01:39:09,820
# O'er the hills and o'er the main

1242
01:39:09,920 --> 01:39:14,310
# Through Flanders, Portugal and Spain

1243
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:18,390
# King George commands, and we obey

1244
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:22,100
# Over the hills and far away...
