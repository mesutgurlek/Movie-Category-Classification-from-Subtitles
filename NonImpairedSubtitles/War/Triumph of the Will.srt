And thoughts as well
to our fallen comrades.

who by their presence are participating
in this day for their political parties.

especially to the representatives
of the Armed Forces here,

My Leader:

Around you stand the flags and standards
of this National Socialism.

38
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,880
Only when they are threadbare...

39
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,440
will the people
be able to understand...

40
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,240
by hindsight,
the greatness of our time...

41
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:06,640
because ofwhat you, my Leader,
mean to Germany!

42
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,160
You are Germany!

43
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:26,440
When you act, the Nation acts.

44
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:30,320
When you judge, the People judge.

45

Our thanks is the vow

57
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:12,360
No revolution
that seems to be permanent...

58
00:26:12,440 --> 00:26:16,240
can lead to anything other
than complete anarchy.

59
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:19,600
So the World will not live at war.

60
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:23,760
So also the people
do not live on revolution.

61
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:31,120
Nothing on this earth that has lasted
for thousands ofyears...

62
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:35,920
was assembled in mere decades.

63
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:42,160
The largest tree also has
the longest period of growth.

64
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,360
What braves the centuries...

65
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:49,120
will also be strong
through the centuries.

It is our unshakeable belief
in ourselves...

68
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:03,080
that is our hope for the youth...

69
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:10,920
to carry on the work which has been put
before them in the stormyyears...

70
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:16,200
of the revolt of 1 91 8 in Munich...

Truth is the foundation...

74
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,160
on which the power of the press
stands in the world.

75
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:37,160
And that it reports the truth
about Germany...

76
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:42,960
is the only demand that we place
on the foreign press.

As I speak, work on the Reich Autobahn
has begun at 51 locations.

79
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:56,520
Although this work
is in its early stage...

80
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,680
today there are already
52,000 men on thejob...

all around there is building...

and new creations...

00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,040

andHeadofthe German LaborFront
(DAF- Deutsche Arbeitsfront)

95
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:06,840
All our work must be dictated
by a single thought--

96
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,720
that the German worker...

97
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,880
be made an upright, proud
and equally entitled national comrade.

As the Leader
of the German legal service...

100
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:28,560
I can say that, clearly, the basis
of the National Socialist State...

101
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:31,440
is the Nationalist Socialist Law Code.

102
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:36,920
And forus ourhighestleader
isalso the highestjudge.!

103
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:46,480
We know how sacred the principles
of these laws are to our Führer.

104
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:50,960
These Reich laws can assure you,

that your life and existence is safe
in this National Socialist State

May the bright flame of our enthusiasm
never be extinguished.

It alone gives light and warmth...

110
00:30:15,960 --> 00:30:20,080
to the creative art
of modern political propaganda.

111
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:24,360
This comes
from the depths of the People...

112
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,520
and from these depths of the people...

113
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:34,440
it must always again
find its roots and its strength.

114
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:41,000
It may be good to possess power
based on strength...

115
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:49,200
but it is better to win
and hold the heart of a People.

00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,120
We build roads...

159
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:39,920
from town to town,
and city to city.

160
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,880
We provide the farmer
with new soil...

161
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:49,920
forests and fields,
land and bread...

162
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,960
forGermany.

163
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:37,960
We didn't stand in the trenches.

164
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,120
Nor were we
under the shell fire of grenades...

165
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:44,760
and still we are soldiers.

166
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,560
Sharpen the hammers...

167
00:34:46,680 --> 00:34:49,920
axes, pickaxes
andspades.!

168
00:34:49,960 --> 00:34:53,720
We are the Reich 'syoungmanhood.!

169
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,280
As once at Langemarck...

170
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,400
at Tannenberg...

171
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,560
before Lüttich (Liege)...

172
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,520
before Verdun...

173
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,800
on the Somme...

174
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,880
on the Ähne...

175
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:21,640
in Flanders...

176
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,520
in the West...

177
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,480
in the East...

178
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,600
in the South...

179
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:35,000
on land, on water,
and in the clouds.

180
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:43,720
Comrades, who were shot
by the Red Front and Reactionaries...

181
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,320
You are not dead.!

182
00:35:50,440 --> 00:35:55,560
You live in Germany.!

183
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,240
My Labor Service Men.

184
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:12,040
For the first time you are presented
for review in this forum...

185
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:18,480
before me
and before the German people.

186
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:22,880
You represent a great idea...

187
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:28,200
and we know that for millions
of our national comrades...

188
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:33,200
physical labor will not longer
be a divisive concept.

189
00:36:33,240 --> 00:36:36,720
But it will instead bind us together
and, furthermore...

190
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:42,120
no longer will it be the case
in Germany...

191
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:46,240
that physical labor will be seen
as anything less...

192
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,120
than any other work.

193
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,880
The whole nation passes
through your school.

194
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,920
The time will come
when no German...

195
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:04,360
can be admitted
into the community of the people...

196
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:09,440
until he has first become a member
ofyour group.

197
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:13,320
And you know that today
you are not only being seen...

198
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:16,960
by the thousands in Nuremberg,
but by all of Germany...

199
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,640
which also sees you here
for the first time today.

200
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:31,040
And I know thatjust as you serve
this Germany proudly...

201
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:37,960
all of Germany today will see its sons
marching in you with proud joy!

202

Hail Victory!
Hail Victory! Hail Victory!

204
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,680
Comrades.

205
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:16,480
Many ofyou here tonight knew me...

206
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:22,320
as an SA man...

207
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,160
marching in the rank and file...

208
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,960
in the first years of the Movement.

209
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:35,720
And Party Comrades,
just as I was an SA man then...

210
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:39,320
so I am still an SA man today!

211
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,600
We SA workers will always be true
only to the Führer...

212
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:57,880
and fight for the Führer.

(Reich Youth Leader)

221
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:33,320
My Leader!

222
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,640
My Comrades!

223
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:44,040
We live again for this hour
which makes us proud and happy.

224
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:50,960
According to your command, my Leader,
a youth stands here...

225
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:56,800
a youth that knows
neither class nor caste.

226
00:44:56,840 --> 00:45:03,400
The young generation of our people
follows afteryou.

227
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:10,880
Just as you demonstrate the highest
self-sacrifice in this Nation...

228
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,000
so does this youth wish to be selfless.

229
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:19,280
Because you embody
the concept of fidelity for us...

230
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:24,880
therefore we wish to be faithful.

231
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:30,040
Adolf Hitler,
the Leader of German Youth, attention!

232
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:50,960
My German youth.

233
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:58,280
After one year
I can greet you again here.

234
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:04,400
You standing here today
represent something...

235
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:10,440
that is happening all over Germany.

236
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:16,400
And we want that you,
German boys and girls...

237
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:24,920
will absorb everything
that we wish for Germany.

238
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:28,160
We want to be one people...

239
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:34,560
and through you,
to become this people.

240
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:38,400
We want a society with
neither castes nor ranks.

241
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:43,840
And you must not allow
these ideas to grow within you.

242
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:47,880
We want to see one Reich.!

243
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,040
And you must educate yourselves
for this.

244
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,200
We want this people to be obedient...

245
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,480
and you must practice obedience
in yourselves.

246
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:03,680
We want this people
to be peace-loving...

247
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,880
but at the same time to be courageous.

248
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,840
And you must, for that reason,
be both peace-loving...

249
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:33,960
You must be both peace-loving
and strong.

250
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:49,080
We want this people
not to become soft...

251
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:52,440
but to become hard and, therefore...

252
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:57,800
you must steel yourselves for this
in youryouth.

253
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:02,160
You must learn sacrifice...

254
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:08,320
and also never to collapse.

255
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,680
Whatever we create today...

256
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:14,840
whatever we do...

257
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:17,240
will all pass away...

258
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,360
but in you Germany will live on.

259
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:24,440
And when we can no longer hold...

260
00:48:24,480 --> 00:48:29,240
the flag that we tore from nothing...

261
00:48:29,360 --> 00:48:32,440
you must hold it firmly in your fists!

262
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,240
And I know
that it cannot be any other way...

263
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:51,800
as we bind ourselves together.

264
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:58,320
Foryou are flesh ofourflesh
andbloodfrom ourblood.!

265
00:48:58,360 --> 00:49:00,560
The same spirit that governs us...

266
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,600
burns in youryoung minds.

267
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:16,440
And when the great columns
of the movement...

268
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:22,600
sweep through Germany today...

269
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:28,840
then I know that you will close ranks...

270
00:49:35,320 --> 00:49:38,240
and we know that Germany
lies in front ofus...

271
00:49:38,360 --> 00:49:40,680
Germanymarches within us...

272
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,920
andGermany followsbehindus.!

and ''CathedralofLights''
on Zeppelin Field.

279
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:04,440
Ayear ago...

280
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:10,200
we met for the first time
on this field;

281
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:17,320
the first general review
of political leaders...

282
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:21,160
of the National Socialist Party.

283
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:25,320
200,000 men have assembled here.

284
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:32,520
They are not here
at the summons of their hearts alone...

285
00:55:32,560 --> 00:55:36,880
but also at the summons
of their loyalty.

286
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:54,240
It was the great calamity of our people
that drove us to the struggle...

287
00:55:54,280 --> 00:56:01,320
brought us together...

288
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:03,520
and left us greater.

289
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:07,040
Those who do not understand...

290
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:11,720
have not experienced
the same calamities among their people.

291
00:56:18,280 --> 00:56:23,840
These things appear
enigmatic and mysterious...

292
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:28,960
that hundreds of thousands
would be led to assemble...

293
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:33,880
amidst calamity and passion.

294
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:37,280
Others cannot understand...

295
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:41,640
that this is not
an order of the State.!

296
00:56:41,720 --> 00:56:44,760
Theyare deceiving themselves.!

297
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:48,800
The State doesnot orderus.!

298
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:51,200
We orderthe State.!

299
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:05,240
The State didnot create us.!

300
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:08,720
Rather we createdourown State.!

301
00:57:12,880 --> 00:57:17,400
No, the movement lives...

302
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:23,040
and it is grounded hard and fast.

303
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:29,360
And as long as one of us
can draw a breath...

304
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:34,240
he will give his strengths
to the movement...

305
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:40,960
just as it was in yesteryear.

306
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:44,400
Then drum will join drum...

307
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,480
flag will join flag...

308
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:51,480
group will join group,
Gau to Gau...

309
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:56,080
and after that,
this earlier divided people...

310
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:01,240
will follow these sacred columns
of the Nation.

311
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:15,720
It would be an outrage
ifwe were to lose...

312
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,360
what we have fought for...

313
00:58:20,440 --> 00:58:23,720
with so much labor,
so much worry...

314
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:27,320
so much sacrifice,
and so many privations.

315
00:58:42,640 --> 00:58:48,200
One cannot live faithfully
and give up...

316
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:53,480
what has given meaning and purpose
to one's entire life.

317
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:58,280
That would not be so...

318
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:04,680
if it were not a cardinal command.

319
00:59:04,720 --> 00:59:09,640
And no earthly power
gave us that command.

320
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:16,160
Forthe God, ourGod, who created
ourpeople, gave us that command.!

321
00:59:23,080 --> 00:59:26,760
So it is our vow this evening...

322
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:32,960
that each hour, on everyday...

323
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:36,960
to think onlyofGermany
ofthe People andReich...

324
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:41,080

325
00:59:41,120 --> 00:59:44,360
To the Germanpeople.!
Hail Victory.!Hail Victory.!

ViktorLutze, Storm Troopers (SA)

331
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,800
My Führer (My Leader):

332
01:06:51,840 --> 01:06:58,360
Just as we have always done our duty
to you in the past...

333
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:04,560
so too in the future,
we await your orders alone.

334
01:07:04,600 --> 01:07:09,200
And we, Comrades, know only to obey...

335
01:07:09,240 --> 01:07:15,040
the orders of our Führer...

336
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:20,280
and to prove that we have remained
true to the Führer.

337
01:07:20,360 --> 01:07:24,440
Our Führer, Adolf Hitler:

338
01:07:24,480 --> 01:07:27,520
Hail Victory.!Hail Victory.!

339
01:07:34,960 --> 01:07:38,120
SA and SS men:

340
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:45,000
A few months ago...

341
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:50,360
a dark shadow cast itself
across our Movement.

342
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:55,600
The SA and other institutions
of the Party...

343
01:07:55,680 --> 01:08:01,840
had nothing whatsoever to do
with this shadow.

344
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:11,040
They who would believe that a rift has
opened in the unity of the Movement...

345
01:08:11,080 --> 01:08:15,680
deceive themselves.

346
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:21,280
Itstands fastas thisblockhere...

347
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:28,840
and nothing in Germany
will break it.

348
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:35,400
And when anyone does harm
to the spirit of my SA...

349
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:39,240
then the SA will not be harmed...

350
01:08:39,240 --> 01:08:42,000
but those who do this harm...

351
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:46,280
will injure only themselves!

352
01:08:54,920 --> 01:09:01,760
And only a fool
or a known liar...

353
01:09:01,800 --> 01:09:06,720
could think...

354
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:12,000
that I would ever
disband an organization...

355
01:09:12,040 --> 01:09:16,000
that took us so manyyears to build.

356
01:09:16,040 --> 01:09:17,880
My Comrades...

357
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:24,280
we stand fast together
for our Germany...

358
01:09:24,320 --> 01:09:29,480
and we must stand fast together
for this Germany.

359
01:09:30,720 --> 01:09:34,240
And I hand to each ofyou
the new insignia...

360
01:09:34,280 --> 01:09:37,560
placing them with confidence...

361
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:42,840
in the hands that I see as the most
trustworthy there are in Germany.

362
01:09:42,880 --> 01:09:50,960
For in the past you have proven
your loyalty to me a thousand times.

363
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:57,920
In the time to come, it cannot
and willnot be any different.

364
01:10:07,640 --> 01:10:15,640
And so I greet you as myold,
faithfulSA andSSmen.!

The Sixth Party Day of the Movement
has come to and end.

421
01:33:50,120 --> 01:33:56,280
What appeared
like a show of political strength...

422
01:33:56,360 --> 01:34:03,160
for millions of Germans
outside of our ranks.

423
01:34:03,200 --> 01:34:06,400
For hundreds of thousands
of fighters...

424
01:34:06,480 --> 01:34:09,600
it was ultimately more.

425
01:34:09,600 --> 01:34:13,280
The great personal
and spiritual meeting...

426
01:34:13,360 --> 01:34:17,600
of the old fighters
and comrades in struggle.

427
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,040
And, perhaps, a cross section ofyou...

428
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:25,080
despite the forced civility
of this review of our Party...

429
01:34:25,160 --> 01:34:29,160
will return with courageous hearts

430
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:35,360
to the days in which it was difficult
to be a National Socialist.

431
01:34:41,600 --> 01:34:48,400
When our Party consisted
of only seven members...

432
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:50,520
it already had two principles.

433
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:55,600
First, it would be a Party
with a true ideology.

434
01:34:55,640 --> 01:34:59,520
And second, it would be,
uncompromisingly...

435
01:34:59,560 --> 01:35:03,680
the one andonlypowerin Germany.

436
01:35:14,360 --> 01:35:18,800
We had to remain in the minority,
because we mobilized...

437
01:35:18,840 --> 01:35:25,520
the most valuable elements of struggle
and sacrifice in the Nation...

438
01:35:25,560 --> 01:35:30,680
which have always been not in the
majority, but rather in the minority.

439
01:35:39,480 --> 01:35:45,960
And because these are the racially best
of the German nation...

440
01:35:46,000 --> 01:35:48,560
they can in the proudest self-esteem...

441
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:52,040
claim the leadership
of the Reich and the people.

442
01:35:52,120 --> 01:35:55,560
The German people...

443
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:59,560
and subordinated itself to
this leadership in ever-growing numbers!

444
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:13,000
The German people is happy...

445
01:36:13,040 --> 01:36:17,160
in the knowledge
that a constantly changing vision...

446
01:36:17,160 --> 01:36:22,720
has been replaced by a fixedpole.!

447
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:41,080
Whoever feels that he is the carrier
of the best blood...

448
01:36:41,160 --> 01:36:46,880
and knowingly uses it
to attain the leadership...

449
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:52,360
will never relinquish it!

450
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:06,160
Ludwig Müller, Reichsbischof
(Reich Bishop ofthe United
German Evangelist Church)

451
01:37:06,240 --> 01:37:11,400
There is always a part of the people who
stand out as really active fighters...

452
01:37:11,480 --> 01:37:18,760
and more is expected from them
than from the millions of national
comrades in the general population.

453
01:37:18,880 --> 01:37:24,960
For them it is not simply enough
to make the pledge: ''Ibelieve.!''

454
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:27,680
Rather, the affirmation: ''Ifight.!''

455
01:37:45,760 --> 01:37:53,160
For all time to come the Party will be
the source of political leadership
for the German people.

456
01:37:53,240 --> 01:37:58,160
It will in its teaching...

457
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:01,560
and was ultimately in its organization
hard as steel...

458
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:04,880
malleable in its tactics
and adaptable in its entirety;

459
01:38:04,920 --> 01:38:09,080
yet it will be a training school
like a holyorder for political leaders.

460
01:38:18,080 --> 01:38:24,720
It must be shown, however,
that all upstanding Germans
become NationalistSocialists.

461
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:30,000
Only the best NationalistSocialists,
however, are Party Comrades.!

462
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:58,800
Once, our enemies worried us and
persecuted us and, from time to time...

463
01:38:58,920 --> 01:39:04,640
removed the lesser elements
from the Movement for us.

464
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:12,400
Today we must examine ourselves
and remove from our midst
the elements that have become bad.

465
01:39:20,320 --> 01:39:23,600
Andtherefore, do notbelong with us.!

466
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:31,840
It is our wish and will...

467
01:39:31,880 --> 01:39:37,400
that this State and this Reich
last for thousand years.

468
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:45,200
We can be happy to know
that this future belongs entirely to us.!

469
01:39:58,200 --> 01:40:01,920
When the olderonesamong us falter...

470
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:07,880
theyouth willstiffen
andremain until theirbodies decay.

471
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:33,760
Only then, ifwe in the Party
with our most obedient dedication...

472
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:41,400
become the highest embodiment of
National Socialist thought and being...

473
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:43,960
then the Party will materialize...

474
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:49,840
into an eternalandindestructible
pillar of the German people and Reich.

475
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:56,760
Then our glorious
and laudable Army...

476
01:40:56,800 --> 01:41:00,040
the old, proud,
standard bearers of our people...

477
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:03,040
who are equally tradition minded...

478
01:41:03,120 --> 01:41:05,720
will champion the Political Leadership
and the Party.

479
01:41:05,760 --> 01:41:11,600
And then these two institutions
will equally educate the German man...

480
01:41:11,640 --> 01:41:15,160
and, therefore, strengthen
and carry on their shoulders...

481
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:18,160
the German State, the German Reich.!

482
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:38,040
At this hour, tens of thousands
of our Party Comrades
are already leaving the City.

483
01:41:38,160 --> 01:41:42,640
While many of them relive
the meeting in their memories...

484
01:41:42,680 --> 01:41:47,400
still others are already planning
the next review.

485
01:41:47,440 --> 01:41:55,520
And again the people come and go and
they will be engrossed anew and happy...

486
01:41:55,600 --> 01:42:00,360
and inspired, for the idea and
the Movement live on in our people...

487
01:42:00,400 --> 01:42:03,600
and with the Movement
are symbol of eternity!

488
01:42:03,640 --> 01:42:06,320
