00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:30,056
a film by Samira MAKHMALBAF

5
00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:28,376
- Said!
- Yes?

6
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:30,256
Thanks for your water.

7
00:01:30,376 --> 00:01:33,416
- You've drunk it all!
- I was thirsty. I'm sorry.

8
00:01:33,536 --> 00:01:34,696
Forget it.

9
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:36,616
Where did you go yesterday?

10
00:01:37,856 --> 00:01:39,416
To Dezle.

11
00:01:39,536 --> 00:01:41,136
Why?

12
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,216
Looking for pupils.

13
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:45,896
But no luck,

14
00:01:46,016 --> 00:01:48,336
I couldn't find any.

15
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:50,736
I was there for three days.

16
00:01:50,856 --> 00:01:52,736
- Cigarette?
- No thanks.

17
00:01:52,856 --> 00:01:55,056
I don't smoke.

18
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:57,896
You couldn't find any pupils?

19
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,536
Not one.

20
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:04,416
My father warned me

21
00:02:04,776 --> 00:02:07,616
but I didn't listen to him

22
00:02:07,736 --> 00:02:09,296
and now,

23
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:13,016
I truly regret it.

24
00:02:13,136 --> 00:02:14,976
- You studied for long?
- Two years.

25
00:02:15,096 --> 00:02:17,496
You became a teacher in two years?

26
00:02:17,616 --> 00:02:19,536
I worked hard.

27
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:21,696
- You like it?
- Not really.

28
00:02:21,816 --> 00:02:22,776
Why?

29
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:26,936
I looked for three days
and I found nothing.

30
00:02:28,896 --> 00:02:31,096
I didn't listen to my father.

31
00:02:33,176 --> 00:02:37,496
- What did he tell you to do?
- To be a shepherd.

32
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:39,496
I failed.

33
00:04:29,536 --> 00:04:31,256
He's gone.

34
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:32,976
Get up.

35
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:39,496
Hurry up!

36
00:04:52,976 --> 00:04:53,896
And your wife?

37
00:04:54,016 --> 00:04:58,136
When we got back from Tehran,
we had a fight

38
00:04:58,616 --> 00:05:02,216
about the doctor.

39
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:05,256
Her family insulted my family.
Mine responded in kind.

40
00:05:05,376 --> 00:05:08,216
So her father took her.

41
00:05:08,336 --> 00:05:10,016
Hurry up.
We have to hide him.

42
00:05:10,256 --> 00:05:12,136
It's been three months

43
00:05:12,296 --> 00:05:13,936
since she went back with her father.

44
00:05:14,056 --> 00:05:17,136
She left me with three kids,
one of them just a baby

45
00:05:17,256 --> 00:05:19,256
I tried to find him a wet nurse.

46
00:05:19,776 --> 00:05:23,616
I went through a hundred families

47
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:26,136
to find one.

48
00:05:26,256 --> 00:05:28,736
As a result

49
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:31,856
he's drunk the milk of many women,
even cows

50
00:05:32,896 --> 00:05:36,256
He looks like
a hundred different women.

51
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,736
He's got the eyes of one,
the ears of another.

52
00:05:39,856 --> 00:05:42,096
And he's sick.

53
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:44,656
Now I run from village to village

54
00:05:44,776 --> 00:05:47,696
looking for a pupil
I can make into a doctor.

55
00:05:47,896 --> 00:05:51,576
That way,
we'd never have to go into town.

56
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:53,576
If there was a doctor
in the next village

57
00:05:53,696 --> 00:05:56,136
things would be easier.

58
00:05:58,056 --> 00:06:01,056
- You're going to make a doctor?
- Yes.

59
00:06:36,096 --> 00:06:38,616
- Which path are you taking?
- The one on the right.

60
00:06:39,376 --> 00:06:41,376
It's dangerous.

61
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:45,176
- Which way are you going?
- This way.

62
00:06:45,296 --> 00:06:47,736
But it's very dangerous.

63
00:06:50,176 --> 00:06:52,856
Wait.

64
00:06:54,256 --> 00:06:56,496
I'll tell you again,
it's a death trap.

65
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,656
Yours is even worse.

66
00:06:58,776 --> 00:07:02,216
No. Yours is more dangerous.
Goodbye.

67
00:07:03,976 --> 00:07:06,656
- Where are you going now?
- to the village.

68
00:07:07,096 --> 00:07:09,576
- Can I come with you?
- If you like.

69
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:12,736
If we go together do you think
we'll find any pupils?

70
00:07:13,256 --> 00:07:14,736
- I'm not coming.
- Why?

71
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:16,656
I want to go to the top.

72
00:07:18,976 --> 00:07:21,176
- How many pupils will you find?
- Two or three.

73
00:07:21,296 --> 00:07:23,096
Fine. Keep them.

74
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,296
I'm going to climb to the very top.

75
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:32,696
The villages bring me bad luck.

76
00:07:32,816 --> 00:07:34,336
My fortune lies up there.

77
00:07:34,456 --> 00:07:38,176
Go on, you take the villages.
I'm going up there.

78
00:07:38,296 --> 00:07:39,296
Goodbye.

79
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,816
Take care.

80
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:29,816
Hello!

81
00:08:30,736 --> 00:08:32,216
Hello!

82
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,616
Is there a school here?

83
00:08:37,736 --> 00:08:39,536
I don't know.

84
00:08:40,496 --> 00:08:42,616
And a teacher?

85
00:08:43,016 --> 00:08:44,496
I don't know.

86
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,616
No idea.

87
00:08:48,616 --> 00:08:49,496
Goodbye.

88
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:51,856
- And I'm sorry.
- The Lord will go with you.

89
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:54,216
Excuse me!

90
00:08:54,536 --> 00:08:56,416
Wait a minute.

91
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:57,776
What?

92
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:08,976
Please, read me this letter.

93
00:09:17,536 --> 00:09:17,976
What is it?

94
00:09:19,456 --> 00:09:21,376
What does he say?

95
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:25,656
Hold on.

96
00:09:28,576 --> 00:09:30,616
This letter isn't in Persian.

97
00:09:31,256 --> 00:09:32,496
Where does it come from?

98
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:35,656
For the love of God, read it to me.

99
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:39,016
It's from your son?
It's not in Persian. Maybe Arabic?

100
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:45,256
Where's it from?

101
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,656
From Iraq.

102
00:09:48,976 --> 00:09:53,696
I don't know if it's in Arabic,
Turkish or Kurdish.

103
00:09:54,576 --> 00:09:56,216
It's from my son.

104
00:09:57,176 --> 00:10:00,176
But from where?
I can't read it.

105
00:10:11,336 --> 00:10:12,816
I return them.

106
00:10:12,936 --> 00:10:16,256
Next he greets his mother,

107
00:10:18,696 --> 00:10:19,176
his sister,
his father and his brother

108
00:10:29,176 --> 00:10:31,336
He finishes by saying goodbye.

109
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:34,616
But how is he getting by?
Has he got money?

110
00:10:43,616 --> 00:10:44,856
Iraqi dinars.

111
00:10:45,096 --> 00:10:48,176
How's he getting on in jail?

112
00:10:50,336 --> 00:10:51,976
I'm sure he's fine...

113
00:10:58,096 --> 00:10:58,936
He must have written
that he misses you.

114
00:11:02,816 --> 00:11:03,976
At the end, he says goodbye.

115
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:08,696
He doesn't say
when he'll be released?

116
00:11:14,336 --> 00:11:15,376
Goodbye.

117
00:11:16,296 --> 00:11:18,376
I don't know.

118
00:11:18,936 --> 00:11:20,576
But when will he be freed?

119
00:11:23,176 --> 00:11:24,736
That's all?

120
00:11:25,696 --> 00:11:29,376
If it's God's will,
he will be released. Don't worry.

121
00:11:34,096 --> 00:11:35,816
Goodbye.

122
00:11:37,856 --> 00:11:38,936
My god!

123
00:12:53,616 --> 00:12:54,856
Young man!

124
00:12:57,616 --> 00:12:59,856
- Are you OK?
- Yes, thank you.

125
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:06,216
Do you know where I can find
the shepherd boys?

126
00:13:06,336 --> 00:13:09,376
Up there. This way or that way.

127
00:13:11,176 --> 00:13:14,536
The goats go up this way?

128
00:13:16,736 --> 00:13:19,216
Listen, I am a teacher.

129
00:13:19,816 --> 00:13:21,536
- What?
- I am a teacher.

130
00:13:21,656 --> 00:13:24,616
So what are you doing here?

131
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:27,856
- Looking for children.
- Good luck.

132
00:13:28,336 --> 00:13:31,016
- Where are they?
- Up there.

133
00:13:31,136 --> 00:13:33,456
Listen, young man,
I'm talking to you.

134
00:13:33,576 --> 00:13:35,536
I've already told you,
they're up there.

135
00:13:36,256 --> 00:13:38,536
- Which way should I go?
- The way I told you.

136
00:13:38,656 --> 00:13:40,576
Straight ahead.

137
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:44,496
Do you know how to write?

138
00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:49,136
Do you know how to write?

139
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:51,816
To read and write?

140
00:13:51,936 --> 00:13:53,096
No.

141
00:13:53,736 --> 00:13:55,536
Would you like to learn?

142
00:13:56,256 --> 00:13:57,536
It's useless.

143
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,416
Show me the way.

144
00:13:59,536 --> 00:14:01,376
The way, young man!

145
00:14:03,696 --> 00:14:05,176
Where are you going?

146
00:14:07,736 --> 00:14:09,136
- Young Man!
- What?

147
00:14:09,256 --> 00:14:10,176
The way?

148
00:14:10,296 --> 00:14:13,296
Here. There. Also here.

149
00:14:14,136 --> 00:14:15,656
Not this way?

150
00:14:16,056 --> 00:14:17,616
I'm talking to you!

151
00:14:17,736 --> 00:14:19,496
- Young man!
- What?

152
00:14:20,296 --> 00:14:22,136
Show me the way.

153
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:25,736
I want you to show me the way.
Look at me!

154
00:14:25,896 --> 00:14:27,616
Leave me alone.

155
00:14:29,736 --> 00:14:31,176
Anybody here?

156
00:14:32,376 --> 00:14:34,136
Anybody here?

157
00:14:34,296 --> 00:14:36,536
Is there anyone here?

158
00:14:39,136 --> 00:14:43,136
Open the windows.
Answer me!

159
00:14:49,576 --> 00:14:52,336
Multiplication tables!

160
00:14:54,296 --> 00:14:56,856
Come and learn how to multiply.

161
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:00,616
One times two is two.

162
00:15:01,496 --> 00:15:04,416
Two times two is four.

163
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:08,856
Madame!

164
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:12,456
Do you need a teacher?

165
00:15:12,576 --> 00:15:14,976
- What?
- I am a teacher.

166
00:15:15,296 --> 00:15:16,936
Where are your children?

167
00:15:17,056 --> 00:15:19,336
Leave me alone.

168
00:15:23,056 --> 00:15:25,416
- I have come to teach your children.
- I am a teacher.

169
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:27,456
- Who are you?
- I'm looking for pupils.

170
00:15:27,656 --> 00:15:30,296
Good for you.

171
00:15:31,456 --> 00:15:34,176
Where are the children?

172
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:37,776
Go away.

173
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:01,616
Anybody here?

174
00:16:02,576 --> 00:16:04,416
Anybody here?

175
00:16:04,696 --> 00:16:06,736
Is there anyone here?

176
00:16:07,656 --> 00:16:11,096
I can hear voices.

177
00:16:11,616 --> 00:16:13,736
I've come a long way

178
00:16:13,936 --> 00:16:15,656
to teach your children

179
00:16:15,896 --> 00:16:19,456
to read and write.

180
00:16:19,736 --> 00:16:22,816
You won't need to pay me much.

181
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:27,296
I'll teach you to read
and write letters.

182
00:16:50,496 --> 00:16:53,776
Children, at last!
Wonderful! Come here.

183
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:58,176
Stop.
Tell me where you've come from.

184
00:16:58,456 --> 00:16:59,416
Where have you come from?

185
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:02,816
Where are you going?

186
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,416
Where have you come from?

187
00:17:09,056 --> 00:17:12,456
I've come from deep in the valley
to find you.

188
00:17:12,576 --> 00:17:14,696
Let us through, mister.

189
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:17,816
Just a moment.

190
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:19,856
I'm not going to eat you.

191
00:17:20,016 --> 00:17:23,176
I only want to talk to you.

192
00:17:24,216 --> 00:17:26,896
- Do you have a school here?
- No.

193
00:17:27,856 --> 00:17:30,416
- And a teacher?
- No.

194
00:17:30,736 --> 00:17:32,816
- Would you like one?
- No.

195
00:17:33,016 --> 00:17:35,736
Where are you going
with those burdens?

196
00:17:35,856 --> 00:17:38,176
- We're mules.
- What?

197
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:41,176
- Then I'll come with you. OK?
- No.

198
00:17:41,336 --> 00:17:43,376
Let us get past, mister.

199
00:17:43,816 --> 00:17:45,856
Let us get past!

200
00:17:46,176 --> 00:17:47,896
Wait a minute, kid!

201
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:51,616
Allow me to finish
and I'll let you go.

202
00:17:52,456 --> 00:17:55,976
Just one question:
where are you going with those?

203
00:17:56,256 --> 00:17:58,096
Let us get past!

204
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,336
It's heavy!
You can't stay there like that.

205
00:18:01,576 --> 00:18:02,856
Let us get past.

206
00:18:03,496 --> 00:18:04,536
We're wiped out.

207
00:18:04,696 --> 00:18:07,016
- You don't have a teacher?
- No.

208
00:18:07,576 --> 00:18:08,936
There's no teachers here.

209
00:18:09,056 --> 00:18:11,376
- Where are you going?
- I don't know.

210
00:18:11,656 --> 00:18:12,656
You don't know?

211
00:18:13,536 --> 00:18:15,896
Let us pass,
we're wiped out.

212
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:17,936
Look.

213
00:18:18,576 --> 00:18:20,736
You're holding us all up.

214
00:18:22,096 --> 00:18:23,136
Let us pass.

215
00:18:55,456 --> 00:18:57,936
I'm a teacher

216
00:18:58,616 --> 00:19:02,016
and I've come to teach you
to read and write.

217
00:19:02,336 --> 00:19:04,536
I've come a long way.

218
00:19:04,976 --> 00:19:07,776
I've been looking for you
for a long time!

219
00:19:08,976 --> 00:19:13,176
I want to teach you
to read and write,

220
00:19:14,136 --> 00:19:17,656
to add up and multiply.

221
00:19:18,816 --> 00:19:21,336
I don't want a lot of money

222
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:22,696
if you don't have any,

223
00:19:23,456 --> 00:19:26,856
you could just give me
something to eat.

224
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:30,776
We carry contraband, stolen goods.

225
00:19:31,016 --> 00:19:33,656
We take it

226
00:19:34,736 --> 00:19:38,976
over the border

227
00:19:39,296 --> 00:19:41,576
between Iran and Iraq.

228
00:19:41,696 --> 00:19:44,256
We're always on the run.

229
00:19:45,696 --> 00:19:47,256
Listen, my child.

230
00:19:47,416 --> 00:19:49,216
With education,

231
00:19:49,376 --> 00:19:51,976
you will be able to read a book

232
00:19:52,456 --> 00:19:55,896
or, even better, a newspaper

233
00:19:56,016 --> 00:19:58,576
when you're travelling.

234
00:19:58,696 --> 00:20:00,576
Learn to read and write!

235
00:20:00,696 --> 00:20:03,736
You'll know what's going on
in the world.

236
00:20:04,856 --> 00:20:08,256
You can learn to add up,

237
00:20:08,736 --> 00:20:12,096
to substract, to do your accounts
without being swindled.

238
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:16,096
What good is it, all that?

239
00:20:16,576 --> 00:20:19,296
You could study or find work

240
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,416
Doing the accounts,

241
00:20:25,536 --> 00:20:27,456
that's great for the Boss.

242
00:20:27,576 --> 00:20:29,456
Us, we're mules.

243
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:32,136
Always on the move.

244
00:20:32,296 --> 00:20:34,856
How do you expect us to read?

245
00:20:34,976 --> 00:20:38,256
To read a book,

246
00:20:38,456 --> 00:20:40,256
you have to sit down.

247
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:43,056
Us, we never stop moving.

248
00:20:56,016 --> 00:20:59,776
Listen, I want to talk to you.

249
00:21:00,736 --> 00:21:02,256
Stop! Wait!

250
00:21:02,656 --> 00:21:04,896
Wait!

251
00:21:17,176 --> 00:21:18,656
Hello.

252
00:21:19,456 --> 00:21:21,616
Do you know how to read and write?

253
00:21:22,336 --> 00:21:24,656
- Do you?
- No.

254
00:21:24,856 --> 00:21:27,416
- Do you want to learn?
- No.

255
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,256
- You don't?
- No.

256
00:21:30,616 --> 00:21:32,016
Hello.

257
00:21:33,256 --> 00:21:35,176
Do you know how to read and write?

258
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,576
- Do you?
- No.

259
00:21:44,656 --> 00:21:46,176
Hello, sir!

260
00:21:47,016 --> 00:21:49,096
- I'm talking to you.
- What?

261
00:21:49,416 --> 00:21:50,976
You wouldn't have a scrap of bread?

262
00:21:51,296 --> 00:21:53,456
It's freezing!

263
00:21:53,736 --> 00:21:55,816
Where are you going?

264
00:21:56,736 --> 00:21:59,456
I don't have a job,
can I come with you?

265
00:21:59,576 --> 00:22:01,536
We don't need you.

266
00:22:10,136 --> 00:22:12,816
Hello. How's it going?

267
00:22:13,896 --> 00:22:16,016
It's freezing!

268
00:22:18,256 --> 00:22:19,896
Hello, sir.

269
00:22:20,456 --> 00:22:21,936
Sir!

270
00:22:25,376 --> 00:22:26,816
I'm talking to you.

271
00:22:27,016 --> 00:22:30,896
Why won't you answer me?

272
00:22:32,096 --> 00:22:34,936
Haven't you got any work for me?

273
00:22:35,056 --> 00:22:36,496
No.

274
00:22:36,616 --> 00:22:38,776
I'll do anything.

275
00:22:39,736 --> 00:22:42,856
We don't have any work ourselves.

276
00:22:43,176 --> 00:22:47,016
I could herd goats, sweep up.
Just give me something to eat.

277
00:22:47,136 --> 00:22:53,056
We haven't got anything
to eat either.

278
00:22:53,216 --> 00:22:54,256
How do you survive?

279
00:22:55,016 --> 00:22:56,216
We're nomads.

280
00:22:56,336 --> 00:22:57,216
I'm hungry.

281
00:22:58,096 --> 00:23:01,856
Give me a piece of bread.

282
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:08,616
Where are you going?
Can I come with you?

283
00:23:09,776 --> 00:23:12,296
We have strayed. We're old.

284
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:14,416
We are lost,

285
00:23:14,536 --> 00:23:16,856
we don't know how
to get back to Iraq.

286
00:23:16,976 --> 00:23:21,496
Can you show us the way,
just as far as the border?

287
00:23:22,296 --> 00:23:24,136
Fine, let's go.

288
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:28,856
I can show you,

289
00:23:28,976 --> 00:23:31,016
but it won't be easy.

290
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:35,216
Halaleh! Bring your father
something to drink.

291
00:23:35,336 --> 00:23:38,336
Bring some water!

292
00:23:39,096 --> 00:23:42,336
What do I get if I take you?

293
00:23:42,536 --> 00:23:45,296
We have nothing to give you!

294
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:47,856
I have to guide you for nothing?

295
00:23:47,976 --> 00:23:51,056
We have nothing to give you.

296
00:23:51,456 --> 00:23:52,936
You must have something!

297
00:23:53,096 --> 00:23:54,976
There is nothing.

298
00:23:56,336 --> 00:23:57,656
Not even a piece of bread?

299
00:23:57,776 --> 00:23:59,736
Not even bread.

300
00:24:00,016 --> 00:24:02,536
It's a hard road.
You must give me something.

301
00:24:02,656 --> 00:24:04,416
We don't have anything.

302
00:24:04,616 --> 00:24:07,296
How can I lead you with no reward?

303
00:24:07,416 --> 00:24:09,056
We have nothing.

304
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:10,856
Not even a scrap?

305
00:24:10,976 --> 00:24:13,456
I can give you forty walnuts.

306
00:24:13,576 --> 00:24:16,336
Only forty?

307
00:24:18,336 --> 00:24:21,816
Forty isn't enough!
Give me fifty.

308
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:26,816
- The route is hard.
- You won't get more than forty.

309
00:24:26,936 --> 00:24:29,016
It's a long hard road.

310
00:24:31,056 --> 00:24:32,416
I accept.

311
00:24:33,856 --> 00:24:35,456
OK.

312
00:24:35,816 --> 00:24:38,576
- What's wrong with him?
- He's sick.

313
00:24:39,136 --> 00:24:40,576
Give him some water!

314
00:24:40,696 --> 00:24:42,416
Drink, drink.

315
00:24:43,096 --> 00:24:45,896
Drink, drink. You won't drink?

316
00:24:47,256 --> 00:24:49,056
Drink!

317
00:24:59,056 --> 00:25:00,536
Dear lady,

318
00:25:02,056 --> 00:25:05,616
give me a little water too.
Madam, I'm thristy.

319
00:25:07,816 --> 00:25:10,176
I'm parched!

320
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:14,376
Give me something to drink.

321
00:25:16,736 --> 00:25:19,056
I'm thirsty.

322
00:25:19,256 --> 00:25:22,136
- Where are you going?
- I'm going on.

323
00:25:22,256 --> 00:25:26,096
For five nuts, will you carry
the sick boy on your blackboard?

324
00:25:26,216 --> 00:25:27,256
Five nuts?

325
00:25:27,376 --> 00:25:28,696
OK.

326
00:25:34,176 --> 00:25:36,016
God help us!

327
00:26:08,856 --> 00:26:11,096
What's wrong with the old man?

328
00:26:13,176 --> 00:26:16,936
He can't piss.

329
00:26:17,296 --> 00:26:18,896
He's sick.

330
00:26:19,056 --> 00:26:20,296
Sick?

331
00:26:21,336 --> 00:26:22,536
Where are you taking him?

332
00:26:22,656 --> 00:26:24,696
To the border.

333
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:25,896
To the border?

334
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:28,336
Who is that woman?

335
00:26:28,696 --> 00:26:31,536
That's the old man's daughter.

336
00:26:33,976 --> 00:26:36,416
He wants to marry her off.

337
00:26:36,616 --> 00:26:41,376
Once it's done,

338
00:26:41,776 --> 00:26:43,816
he'll go to his grave in peace.

339
00:26:43,936 --> 00:26:45,656
How much does he want
for her dowry?

340
00:26:45,816 --> 00:26:46,776
Nothing.

341
00:26:48,136 --> 00:26:51,616
What do you mean, nothing?
She's poor?

342
00:26:52,976 --> 00:26:54,736
If you want her hand,

343
00:26:55,136 --> 00:26:58,016
give him a walnut tree.

344
00:26:58,696 --> 00:27:03,416
I don't have one. I'm a teacher.
I only have this blackboard.

345
00:27:03,696 --> 00:27:06,576
- Only this blackboard?
- Yes.

346
00:27:06,776 --> 00:27:10,296
I must ask her father
if he will allow it...

347
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:17,456
Sure you won't regret it?

348
00:27:17,696 --> 00:27:19,856
No, I won't regret it.

349
00:27:23,136 --> 00:27:24,736
Get him down there

350
00:27:33,976 --> 00:27:34,936
What about me?

351
00:27:35,056 --> 00:27:40,816
Let's go and ask for her hand
right away.

352
00:27:44,376 --> 00:27:48,296
Force yourself, my brother. Piss.

353
00:27:48,856 --> 00:27:52,416
Hurry up. Don't be afraid.

354
00:28:05,656 --> 00:28:09,496
Don't look at her!
You haven't been introduced.

355
00:28:13,296 --> 00:28:14,536
Said!

356
00:28:14,656 --> 00:28:19,056
You wish to marry Halaleh?

357
00:28:19,176 --> 00:28:20,136
Yes.

358
00:28:20,336 --> 00:28:21,896
- You agree?
- Yes.

359
00:28:32,456 --> 00:28:35,536
Come on.

360
00:28:38,136 --> 00:28:40,136
Come on... piss.

361
00:28:56,856 --> 00:28:58,776
Are you sure?

362
00:28:59,776 --> 00:29:01,176
Yes.

363
00:29:01,496 --> 00:29:03,616
- You will shield her from hunger?
- Yes.

364
00:29:03,736 --> 00:29:06,616
- And from thirst?
- I will shield her from hunger.

365
00:29:06,776 --> 00:29:10,696
- You swear not to abandon her?
- I promise.

366
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,336
Halaleh?

367
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,936
Yes?

368
00:29:15,056 --> 00:29:19,256
Do you accept Said as your husband
with this blackboard for a dowry?

369
00:29:21,616 --> 00:29:23,256
Are you agreed?

370
00:29:23,656 --> 00:29:25,856
You wish to marry him?

371
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:27,336
With the blackboard?

372
00:29:28,336 --> 00:29:30,176
The blackboard? Yes.

373
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:32,176
Yes.

374
00:29:38,336 --> 00:29:38,816
You are truly agreed?

375
00:29:49,416 --> 00:29:50,736
Halaleh!

376
00:29:53,456 --> 00:29:56,656
And you, do you take him?

377
00:29:58,096 --> 00:29:59,096
Yes.

378
00:30:03,416 --> 00:30:05,776
You are now husband and wife.

379
00:31:25,816 --> 00:31:28,896
Let's rest here.

380
00:31:29,496 --> 00:31:31,536
You want to stop here?

381
00:31:40,176 --> 00:31:42,216
You want to be stuck here forever?

382
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,936
Won't you get sick of it?

383
00:31:47,336 --> 00:31:48,696
What's your name?

384
00:31:52,136 --> 00:31:53,576
Have you got any toothache?

385
00:31:53,736 --> 00:31:55,336
Open your mouth.

386
00:31:56,016 --> 00:31:57,496
Open your mouth.

387
00:31:58,056 --> 00:31:59,376
Which tooth is it?

388
00:32:05,096 --> 00:32:07,576
Do you know how to read and write?

389
00:32:09,456 --> 00:32:11,256
Do you want to learn?

390
00:32:13,256 --> 00:32:14,896
As you wish.

391
00:32:20,296 --> 00:32:22,096
What's your name?

392
00:32:23,736 --> 00:32:25,376
- Your name?
- Hayyaz.

393
00:32:26,976 --> 00:32:27,896
Hayyaz?

394
00:32:28,616 --> 00:32:31,336
You do this journey all the time?

395
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:34,136
Aren't you tired?

396
00:32:35,776 --> 00:32:37,896
- You know how to read and write?
- No.

397
00:32:38,976 --> 00:32:40,896
- You don't want to?
- No.

398
00:32:42,016 --> 00:32:44,656
Do you know
what it would allow you to do?

399
00:32:44,856 --> 00:32:46,256
To read a book

400
00:32:46,456 --> 00:32:50,056
or a newspaper,
to work, to listen, to speak...

401
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:53,016
When you can read a book,

402
00:32:53,176 --> 00:32:56,416
you discover stories...

403
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:00,656
Stories?
I've got a hundred.

404
00:33:01,816 --> 00:33:06,376
It was spring. I climbed to the peak
with your friends,

405
00:33:06,496 --> 00:33:09,096
to the top of the mountain.

406
00:33:09,216 --> 00:33:11,976
The goats were grazing peacefully.

407
00:33:12,496 --> 00:33:16,696
We chased a rabbit.

408
00:33:17,136 --> 00:33:20,896
It ran out of breath.
We caught it.

409
00:33:21,456 --> 00:33:24,176
My friend tortured it.

410
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:26,576
He wanted to cut its head off.

411
00:33:26,896 --> 00:33:29,296
I told him it was a sin.

412
00:33:29,416 --> 00:33:32,256
But he continued to torment it,

413
00:33:32,456 --> 00:33:34,976
he still wanted to cut its head off.

414
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,896
He tortured it

415
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,736
and tried to cut its head off.

416
00:33:40,856 --> 00:33:45,456
I said that it was a sin.

417
00:33:46,016 --> 00:33:49,376
I told him to stop

418
00:33:49,496 --> 00:33:51,896
and I grabbed his hand,
to try stop him.

419
00:33:52,016 --> 00:33:54,656
He insulted me

420
00:33:55,056 --> 00:33:57,856
and cut the rabbit's head off.

421
00:33:58,056 --> 00:34:02,176
They washed it and split it up

422
00:34:02,456 --> 00:34:05,416
without giving me my share.

423
00:34:06,016 --> 00:34:09,976
That upset me.

424
00:34:10,096 --> 00:34:14,296
I went off and cried.

425
00:34:14,696 --> 00:34:18,216
I led my goats away

426
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:20,856
and then we fought.

427
00:34:21,336 --> 00:34:24,296
Then, as it was late,

428
00:34:24,416 --> 00:34:27,216
we went our separate ways

429
00:34:27,336 --> 00:34:29,616
to our homes.

430
00:34:30,056 --> 00:34:33,736
Drop it!
I don't need your stories.

431
00:34:34,576 --> 00:34:36,656
I want to teach you.

432
00:34:36,776 --> 00:34:40,736
Sir, your honour,
please come here a minute.

433
00:34:53,016 --> 00:34:54,776
- What's your name?
- Reeboir.

434
00:34:54,896 --> 00:34:57,576
Reeboir? Me too.

435
00:34:57,816 --> 00:34:58,896
No kidding?

436
00:35:00,856 --> 00:35:03,296
Do you know what that says, Reeboit?

437
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:04,896
No idea.

438
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:09,656
That says "he who walks".
The traveller.

439
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:13,096
- Do you know how to read and write?
- No.

440
00:35:13,656 --> 00:35:16,336
- Do you want me to teach you?
- Yes!

441
00:35:16,576 --> 00:35:18,456
- You really do?
- Yes.

442
00:35:21,496 --> 00:35:24,056
- Shall we begin?
- OK.

443
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,176
Take it, eat.

444
00:35:26,296 --> 00:35:28,736
- No, thank you.
- Please, eat.

445
00:35:29,376 --> 00:35:32,136
Thank you.

446
00:35:33,576 --> 00:35:36,496
- What do you do?
- I'm a teacher.

447
00:35:37,816 --> 00:35:41,016
You're joking? You're a teacher?

448
00:35:41,816 --> 00:35:46,376
Can you teach me to write my name?

449
00:35:46,576 --> 00:35:48,776
- Do you want to learn?
- Yes. Really.

450
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:51,976
- You've never written your name?
- No.

451
00:36:49,336 --> 00:36:50,696
Hello.

452
00:36:57,056 --> 00:36:59,016
Where are you going with the kid?

453
00:37:01,416 --> 00:37:04,096
Go and play.

454
00:37:05,616 --> 00:37:07,096
Are you OK?

455
00:37:22,296 --> 00:37:25,496
Go and play!

456
00:37:34,536 --> 00:37:38,376
Don't cry, your mother's coming.

457
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,616
Come and play with the nuts.

458
00:38:08,696 --> 00:38:12,496
Stay here, little one.
Mummy's coming.

459
00:38:12,616 --> 00:38:16,576
Sit down and play.

460
00:38:19,776 --> 00:38:22,536
Don't move. Come on. Sit down.

461
00:38:26,016 --> 00:38:29,016
Hold the walnut in your hand.

462
00:38:29,136 --> 00:38:31,816
That's right... like that.

463
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:47,136
That's it... just like that.

464
00:38:51,816 --> 00:38:53,736
Lift your hand.

465
00:38:57,776 --> 00:38:59,256
Throw it!

466
00:39:15,376 --> 00:39:18,816
"I love you".
Now spell it.

467
00:39:18,976 --> 00:39:21,656
Lift your hand, like that.
Watch me.

468
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:24,816
I... love... you.

469
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,976
Look at me...

470
00:39:28,896 --> 00:39:32,296
"I love you"

471
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:33,936
You won't answer?

472
00:39:34,056 --> 00:39:36,216
Fine, I'll give you a zero

473
00:39:36,336 --> 00:39:39,376
because you wouldn't answer me.

474
00:39:52,616 --> 00:39:56,296
You cheated.
You stretched out your arm.

475
00:39:57,536 --> 00:39:59,856
You cheated!

476
00:40:11,256 --> 00:40:14,256
We'll have a return game!

477
00:40:59,496 --> 00:41:02,376
As you refuse to answer me,

478
00:41:03,336 --> 00:41:06,656
I'll give you zero.

479
00:41:14,136 --> 00:41:19,136
But because you're a good girl,
I'll give you eighteen.

480
00:41:19,576 --> 00:41:21,456
"Eighteen".

481
00:41:25,416 --> 00:41:26,536
Come.

482
00:41:29,736 --> 00:41:32,816
Why do you refuse to learn?

483
00:41:32,936 --> 00:41:35,656
I'm the best teacher around.

484
00:41:35,776 --> 00:41:38,776
All my pupils get... twenty

485
00:41:40,416 --> 00:41:41,896
out of twenty!

486
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:49,856
You deserve zero, but you're
a good girl. I'll give you eighteen.

487
00:41:58,776 --> 00:42:01,936
I want to piss.

488
00:42:04,816 --> 00:42:08,496
Help me, God...

489
00:42:10,336 --> 00:42:12,016
Spare me, God...

490
00:42:21,216 --> 00:42:23,656
Help me, God...

491
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:39,056
Spare me, God...

492
00:42:39,176 --> 00:42:43,096
Come here
and try and relieve yourself.

493
00:42:43,216 --> 00:42:46,616
If you don't squeeze it out,
you'll die.

494
00:42:46,736 --> 00:42:51,176
You've been suffering
for three days now.

495
00:42:51,296 --> 00:42:53,616
Hurry up.

496
00:42:55,176 --> 00:42:58,656
Piss... Piss... Piss.

497
00:43:13,376 --> 00:43:16,376
Hurry up...

498
00:43:16,496 --> 00:43:18,856
Relieve yourself. Quick.

499
00:43:18,976 --> 00:43:20,936
If you don't,
you're as good as dead.

500
00:43:21,056 --> 00:43:24,056
Hurry up.

501
00:43:29,416 --> 00:43:31,296
Let's help him!

502
00:44:24,616 --> 00:44:28,296
Couldn't manage it?

503
00:44:30,336 --> 00:44:32,576
I love you.

504
00:44:39,776 --> 00:44:43,016
You, Blackboard! Move...

505
00:45:19,016 --> 00:45:22,456
- You still couldn't piss?
- No.

506
00:45:27,336 --> 00:45:29,016
God help me!

507
00:45:29,136 --> 00:45:31,536
- You didn't piss?
- No.

508
00:45:37,216 --> 00:45:41,616
I swear to you, Satan himself

509
00:45:41,736 --> 00:45:45,536
could piss in that water.

510
00:45:47,136 --> 00:45:49,576
I have pissed in that water,

511
00:45:49,696 --> 00:45:52,296
but not him.

512
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:55,896
He must have committed
some terrible sin

513
00:45:56,656 --> 00:45:58,896
and now he can't piss!

514
00:46:01,736 --> 00:46:03,896
- You didn't piss?
- No.

515
00:46:09,856 --> 00:46:13,376
My God, have mercy on me!

516
00:46:13,816 --> 00:46:16,536
Have mercy on me.

517
00:46:18,456 --> 00:46:19,896
You didn't piss?

518
00:46:20,016 --> 00:46:21,416
No.

519
00:46:26,456 --> 00:46:29,056
That's it. Yes, R.

520
00:46:30,616 --> 00:46:32,056
Well done.

521
00:46:41,656 --> 00:46:43,136
B like Bread.

522
00:46:51,616 --> 00:46:52,776
B like Bread...

523
00:46:55,056 --> 00:46:56,136
O like Oil...

524
00:46:57,056 --> 00:47:00,496
See how easy it is: Reeboir...

525
00:47:04,096 --> 00:47:06,496
Run, quick.

526
00:47:06,656 --> 00:47:09,136
Run!

527
00:47:16,056 --> 00:47:17,976
Quick!

528
00:47:45,296 --> 00:47:49,016
Repeat: R like Reeboir.

529
00:48:06,616 --> 00:48:07,736
Reeboir.

530
00:48:48,016 --> 00:48:49,696
He's fallen down!

531
00:48:49,856 --> 00:48:50,576
Shakak!

532
00:48:51,936 --> 00:48:53,576
- Who's fallen?
- Hayyaz.

533
00:49:36,656 --> 00:49:40,576
Don't cry, Hayyaz.
Tell the story of the rabbit.

534
00:49:42,336 --> 00:49:46,856
It was spring.
Me and four friends

535
00:49:47,296 --> 00:49:50,176
we climbed up high,
to the top of the mountain.

536
00:49:50,296 --> 00:49:54,136
The sheep were feeding happily.

537
00:49:54,256 --> 00:49:57,256
We saw a rabbit and we caught it.

538
00:49:59,376 --> 00:50:02,856
- You can read and write, boy?
- Yes.

539
00:50:03,336 --> 00:50:05,616
- You can?
- Yes.

540
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:07,496
But you told me you couldn't!

541
00:50:07,616 --> 00:50:10,336
I don't trust strangers.

542
00:50:10,456 --> 00:50:11,376
Why?

543
00:50:11,496 --> 00:50:13,536
My mother warned me not to.

544
00:50:14,816 --> 00:50:16,336
Your friends can read?

545
00:50:16,456 --> 00:50:19,336
Most of them, yes.

546
00:50:19,456 --> 00:50:23,776
But their mothers told them
never to trust strangers.

547
00:50:29,256 --> 00:50:33,056
Children. Listen to me a minute.

548
00:50:33,176 --> 00:50:37,696
Sit down.
Don't waste what time you have.

549
00:50:40,056 --> 00:50:43,176
Let me teach you.

550
00:50:43,296 --> 00:50:45,296
Look at my blackboard!

551
00:50:45,416 --> 00:50:49,416
I want ot teach you
to read and write.

552
00:50:49,536 --> 00:50:52,096
Watch me! Listen to me!

553
00:50:53,096 --> 00:50:54,576
Don't listen to him.

554
00:50:54,696 --> 00:50:56,696
Let's get out of here!

555
00:50:56,816 --> 00:50:59,416
Let's go! Carry him.

556
00:50:59,536 --> 00:51:01,576
Children! Where are you going?

557
00:51:04,216 --> 00:51:05,296
Stop!

558
00:51:06,816 --> 00:51:08,696
Listen to me!

559
00:51:11,256 --> 00:51:13,056
Don't go!

560
00:51:14,016 --> 00:51:17,096
It's your fault, all this!

561
00:51:19,216 --> 00:51:20,656
Children!

562
00:51:47,016 --> 00:51:49,456
- Repeat.
- Did I say it right?

563
00:51:49,576 --> 00:51:51,096
Well done.

564
00:51:55,656 --> 00:51:56,816
Very good.

565
00:51:58,776 --> 00:52:00,456
Stretch out the R...

566
00:52:01,896 --> 00:52:04,576
R like Reeboir.

567
00:52:05,496 --> 00:52:07,496
Listen, friend.

568
00:52:09,736 --> 00:52:13,536
What happened:
we chased the rabbit,

569
00:52:13,656 --> 00:52:16,536
we caught it

570
00:52:16,656 --> 00:52:19,696
and we ate it.

571
00:52:19,816 --> 00:52:21,856
It was tasty!

572
00:52:21,976 --> 00:52:23,376
Delicious!

573
00:53:38,376 --> 00:53:39,656
A like Apple...

574
00:53:42,296 --> 00:53:46,616
Be quiet.
They're behind us.

575
00:53:46,736 --> 00:53:50,576
Reeboir and his group, this way.

576
00:53:50,696 --> 00:53:53,896
Group two, take the other path.

577
00:53:56,256 --> 00:53:57,816
The rest of you, follow me.

578
00:53:58,256 --> 00:54:00,456
Be careful. It's dangerous.

579
00:54:15,496 --> 00:54:20,016
Not this way!
There are landmines everywhere!

580
00:54:20,416 --> 00:54:25,016
Take the other path.

581
00:54:25,536 --> 00:54:29,656
Look out!

582
00:54:29,776 --> 00:54:33,256
Don't get yourselves killed.

583
00:54:34,176 --> 00:54:37,696
Go round the other side!

584
00:55:13,096 --> 00:55:14,736
Two times two?

585
00:55:15,776 --> 00:55:17,176
Four.

586
00:55:17,656 --> 00:55:19,376
Reply!

587
00:55:19,936 --> 00:55:22,216
Reply swiftly, learn swiftly.

588
00:55:22,896 --> 00:55:24,536
Two times three?

589
00:55:25,576 --> 00:55:27,216
Six.

590
00:55:29,176 --> 00:55:30,856
Four times two?

591
00:55:33,936 --> 00:55:37,216
Come on, answer!

592
00:55:38,616 --> 00:55:40,216
Two times five?

593
00:55:41,576 --> 00:55:44,096
Come on: ten!

594
00:55:44,256 --> 00:55:47,456
To learn quickly
you must answer quickly.

595
00:55:48,576 --> 00:55:50,096
One times two?

596
00:55:50,336 --> 00:55:52,256
Two.

597
00:55:53,096 --> 00:55:54,696
Two times two? Four.

598
00:55:55,016 --> 00:55:58,456
One times two? Two.

599
00:56:08,656 --> 00:56:10,536
Mother, a rabbit!

600
00:56:30,736 --> 00:56:32,056
Chuan!

601
00:56:32,176 --> 00:56:35,416
What are you doing?
The Devil take you!

602
00:56:37,816 --> 00:56:39,216
Halaleh!

603
00:56:41,536 --> 00:56:44,416
Where is she gone?

604
00:56:59,696 --> 00:57:02,016
The Devil take you!

605
00:57:07,096 --> 00:57:08,336
Halaleh!

606
00:57:10,656 --> 00:57:13,416
Where are you?

607
00:57:24,416 --> 00:57:28,296
Please, sir,
have you seen my wife?

608
00:57:47,176 --> 00:57:49,856
Where are you going?

609
00:57:50,176 --> 00:57:51,896
Stop...

610
00:58:01,976 --> 00:58:03,656
You want some walnuts?

611
00:58:11,456 --> 00:58:13,496
One times two is two!

612
00:58:19,176 --> 00:58:21,456
Why are you running away?

613
00:58:22,456 --> 00:58:25,576
Have I done something wrong?

614
00:58:25,936 --> 00:58:27,856
If maths is too difficult,

615
00:58:27,976 --> 00:58:31,816
I'll teach you to read.

616
00:58:31,936 --> 00:58:35,056
Repeat after me...

617
00:58:36,336 --> 00:58:39,616
"I love you"

618
00:58:39,736 --> 00:58:41,656
See, it's easy.

619
00:58:44,256 --> 00:58:45,656
Say it!

620
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:49,496
Come on, say it!

621
00:58:49,616 --> 00:58:53,376
Say "I love you".

622
00:58:53,496 --> 00:58:54,416
Look at me.

623
00:59:00,056 --> 00:59:03,656
What sort of student are you?

624
00:59:03,776 --> 00:59:06,216
I'll give you eight.

625
00:59:08,856 --> 00:59:11,536
No, not eight.

626
00:59:11,656 --> 00:59:13,176
That would fail you.

627
00:59:13,296 --> 00:59:17,056
I'll give you ten,

628
00:59:20,136 --> 00:59:22,016
so you pass.

629
00:59:22,216 --> 00:59:23,816
Say it!

630
00:59:24,536 --> 00:59:26,736
Say "I love you".

631
00:59:26,856 --> 00:59:28,416
You don't want to?

632
00:59:29,376 --> 00:59:30,936
What sort of student are you?

633
00:59:32,856 --> 00:59:35,536
I'm giving you zero.

634
00:59:39,096 --> 00:59:41,616
At least say that you don't love me.

635
00:59:43,896 --> 00:59:45,576
What's wrong?

636
00:59:47,656 --> 00:59:49,776
You won't say that either?

637
00:59:51,976 --> 00:59:53,736
Here comes another zero.

638
00:59:55,616 --> 00:59:57,216
Happy now?

639
00:59:58,296 --> 01:00:00,856
Now a zero for your son.

640
01:00:02,616 --> 01:00:04,416
Here's a zero for your son.

641
01:00:06,056 --> 01:00:07,216
What?

642
01:00:08,536 --> 01:00:13,336
You still won't answer?
I'll give you a zero for your father.

643
01:00:14,936 --> 01:00:16,096
Here.

644
01:00:23,656 --> 01:00:26,536
Still got nothing to say?

645
01:00:26,656 --> 01:00:30,496
I'll give myself a zero.

646
01:00:31,216 --> 01:00:33,816
For having been stupid enough
to follow you.

647
01:00:33,936 --> 01:00:36,496
What kind of a life is this?

648
01:00:36,856 --> 01:00:39,216
Goodbye.

649
01:00:43,736 --> 01:00:45,616
How could I have loved you?

650
01:00:45,856 --> 01:00:47,416
You're not listening to me!

651
01:00:52,376 --> 01:00:54,176
Blackboard!

652
01:00:55,656 --> 01:00:57,056
Stop!

653
01:00:57,416 --> 01:00:59,336
Blackboard!

654
01:01:02,576 --> 01:01:03,976
Stop.

655
01:01:15,856 --> 01:01:19,296
Listen!

656
01:01:32,416 --> 01:01:35,496
My heart is like a train.

657
01:01:35,616 --> 01:01:40,056
At every station,
someone gets on or off.

658
01:01:40,176 --> 01:01:43,896
But there is someone
who never gets off.

659
01:01:45,376 --> 01:01:46,616
My son.

660
01:01:51,216 --> 01:01:52,496
Halaleh...

661
01:01:54,296 --> 01:01:56,176
What's happening?

662
01:02:14,816 --> 01:02:16,816
Escape! Hurry up!

663
01:02:17,456 --> 01:02:19,056
What's going on?

664
01:02:27,616 --> 01:02:32,256
The soldiers at the border
have opened fire!

665
01:04:04,616 --> 01:04:05,976
A like Apple.

666
01:04:07,976 --> 01:04:10,216
Break the syllables up.

667
01:04:32,336 --> 01:04:35,896
Excuse me, Sir. I'm sorry.

668
01:04:36,256 --> 01:04:39,936
We're in danger.
I'll come back later.

669
01:06:29,336 --> 01:06:30,816
Halt!

670
01:06:31,176 --> 01:06:33,696
Who goes there?

671
01:07:06,336 --> 01:07:08,016
What's your name?

672
01:07:09,096 --> 01:07:11,416
- You don't want to tell me?
- Ghazal.

673
01:07:13,656 --> 01:07:16,376
Do you know how to read and write?

674
01:07:18,176 --> 01:07:20,336
- Do you?
No.

675
01:07:21,496 --> 01:07:23,976
- Where is your village?
- Down there.

676
01:07:24,096 --> 01:07:26,736
- That's Dezl?
- Yes.

677
01:07:26,856 --> 01:07:29,696
- Is there a school?
- No.

678
01:07:30,856 --> 01:07:32,856
- Do you want a teacher?
- No.

679
01:08:03,616 --> 01:08:06,376
- Will we have to wait long?
- Who knows.

680
01:08:06,496 --> 01:08:07,776
Where are your friends?

681
01:08:07,896 --> 01:08:10,576
We're meeting up by the river.

682
01:08:10,696 --> 01:08:13,736
No, it was near the goats.

683
01:08:13,856 --> 01:08:16,816
- They're not coming.
- They've been caught.

684
01:08:25,856 --> 01:08:29,936
Thanks for the milk. Excellent.

685
01:08:57,616 --> 01:09:00,576
Sir, I've written something.
- What?

686
01:09:03,496 --> 01:09:05,256
- I wrote something.
- What?

687
01:09:05,376 --> 01:09:07,456
- I wrote my name.
- Well done.

688
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:09,016
I wrote Reeboir.

689
01:09:11,216 --> 01:09:13,456
Run for your life!

690
01:09:40,096 --> 01:09:41,376
Take him.

691
01:09:41,496 --> 01:09:42,696
Come.

692
01:09:44,816 --> 01:09:46,136
Quick.

693
01:09:49,536 --> 01:09:51,176
It's just like at Halebtcheh...

694
01:09:57,576 --> 01:10:00,536
I built a wall to protect us

695
01:10:01,776 --> 01:10:03,416
from chemical weapons.

696
01:10:08,696 --> 01:10:10,056
Father!

697
01:10:15,936 --> 01:10:18,536
Chemical weapons...

698
01:10:24,296 --> 01:10:25,656
Father!

699
01:10:41,136 --> 01:10:42,456
Look after him.

700
01:10:57,896 --> 01:10:59,136
Chemical weapons...

701
01:10:59,416 --> 01:11:00,656
What's happened?

702
01:11:02,016 --> 01:11:04,136
I pissed.

703
01:11:08,496 --> 01:11:10,256
Hide under the blackboard.

704
01:11:14,816 --> 01:11:17,176
My daughter!

705
01:11:27,336 --> 01:11:30,936
Your brother is dead. Let's go.
He wanted to die in his homeland.

706
01:11:31,056 --> 01:11:35,416
He isn't dead.

707
01:11:37,096 --> 01:11:39,376
Come on. He is dead.

708
01:12:04,656 --> 01:12:07,136
- Just like at Halebtcheh.
- It's rifle fire.

709
01:12:08,016 --> 01:12:11,336
It's not chemical weapons.

710
01:12:11,456 --> 01:12:14,896
Don't worry.

711
01:12:15,016 --> 01:12:19,096
It's the soldiers
from over the border

712
01:12:19,576 --> 01:12:22,376
who were firing.

713
01:12:23,696 --> 01:12:26,776
It's not chemical weapons.

714
01:12:28,536 --> 01:12:32,856
Don't be afraid, my darling.

715
01:12:36,336 --> 01:12:38,096
The women...

716
01:12:38,256 --> 01:12:40,216
The children...

717
01:12:46,456 --> 01:12:49,336
We're not going to die.

718
01:12:50,176 --> 01:12:52,936
It's not chemical weapons.

719
01:12:53,056 --> 01:12:54,976
It's the soldiers, over the border.

720
01:12:55,096 --> 01:12:58,976
If you hear us, they'll fire.

721
01:12:59,216 --> 01:13:01,056
I swear, it's not chemical weapons.

722
01:13:05,856 --> 01:13:07,576
The women...

723
01:13:07,856 --> 01:13:09,536
The men...

724
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:29,816
Hide under the blackboard.

725
01:13:36,936 --> 01:13:39,696
I'll protect you.

726
01:14:31,376 --> 01:14:33,096
Strop!

727
01:14:37,016 --> 01:14:40,856
There. The border.

728
01:14:40,976 --> 01:14:42,656
The land of your fathers,

729
01:14:42,776 --> 01:14:44,856
of your ancestors.

730
01:14:44,976 --> 01:14:46,816
Your homeland!

731
01:14:46,936 --> 01:14:49,536
You're lying!

732
01:14:49,656 --> 01:14:52,256
I swear I'm not.

733
01:14:52,416 --> 01:14:55,616
It's the truth. Take a good look.

734
01:14:55,736 --> 01:14:57,816
Don't you recognise Halebtcheh?

735
01:14:57,936 --> 01:15:00,136
No. It's not the border.

736
01:15:00,256 --> 01:15:03,336
He's tricked us, I know it.

737
01:15:03,456 --> 01:15:07,376
He's lying.
It's not the border.

738
01:15:07,496 --> 01:15:12,216
We are lost.

739
01:15:12,456 --> 01:15:15,336
I know our border very well.
This isn't it.

740
01:15:15,456 --> 01:15:17,896
I'm not lying.

741
01:15:18,016 --> 01:15:20,056
I swear to you this is it.

742
01:15:20,176 --> 01:15:23,176
This is your homeland.

743
01:15:23,296 --> 01:15:26,936
This isn't the border!
We are lost!

744
01:15:27,056 --> 01:15:29,616
Can't you understand?

745
01:15:36,496 --> 01:15:37,496
Don't you believe me?

746
01:15:37,656 --> 01:15:41,536
You're lying.
You've tricked us, Blackboard!

747
01:15:42,136 --> 01:15:43,856
I swear to you, I'm not lying.

748
01:15:43,976 --> 01:15:46,536
It's been like this
since the bombing.

749
01:15:49,816 --> 01:15:52,176
It's not true!

750
01:15:52,296 --> 01:15:55,296
I swear to you, this is the border.

751
01:15:58,536 --> 01:16:01,776
You're looking at Halebtcheh.

752
01:16:02,256 --> 01:16:06,216
It's because of the bombing...

753
01:16:44,216 --> 01:16:46,456
God be praised!

754
01:17:30,256 --> 01:17:33,736
We are grateful to you.
Here are the nuts.

755
01:17:34,256 --> 01:17:36,376
What will you do now?

756
01:17:36,496 --> 01:17:38,776
Will you cross the border with us?

757
01:17:38,896 --> 01:17:40,816
No, I can't.

758
01:17:40,936 --> 01:17:45,056
but your wife wants to cross over.
She won't stay with you.

759
01:17:45,176 --> 01:17:46,576
What's your decision?

760
01:17:46,696 --> 01:17:50,496
If she doesn't want me,
what can I do?

761
01:17:50,616 --> 01:17:52,936
I don't know. You must decide.

762
01:17:53,056 --> 01:17:54,256
A divorce?

763
01:17:54,376 --> 01:17:56,496
Yes, if that's what she wants.

764
01:17:56,616 --> 01:17:58,696
Let's find out.

765
01:18:00,136 --> 01:18:03,696
Are you coming with us, Blackboard?

766
01:18:03,816 --> 01:18:06,496
I can't.
I belong here, in this land.

767
01:18:07,056 --> 01:18:10,576
Your wife wants to return
to her country. She doesn't want you.

768
01:18:10,696 --> 01:18:12,456
Did she tell you that?

769
01:18:15,856 --> 01:18:19,136
There's nothing I can do.
I'll divorce her.

770
01:18:19,256 --> 01:18:21,616
- You will divorce her?
- Yes.

771
01:18:22,216 --> 01:18:24,816
Go and find her.

772
01:18:32,456 --> 01:18:34,256
Put it down here.

773
01:18:37,336 --> 01:18:40,536
Do you agree to a divorce?

774
01:18:40,736 --> 01:18:44,696
And that you will take
the blackboard?

775
01:18:44,816 --> 01:18:46,656
The blackboard? Yes.

776
01:18:46,776 --> 01:18:49,856
You may look at each other

777
01:18:49,976 --> 01:18:52,016
one last time.

778
01:18:52,136 --> 01:18:53,976
Lift your hand.

779
01:18:54,936 --> 01:18:56,656
Take that stick.

780
01:18:57,856 --> 01:18:59,376
Halaleh,

781
01:18:59,496 --> 01:19:01,176
you are now divorced,

782
01:19:01,456 --> 01:19:05,976
and the blackboard is yours.

783
01:19:06,696 --> 01:19:10,056
May God keep you from hunger!

784
01:19:10,176 --> 01:19:12,536
May God keep you from thirst!

785
01:19:12,656 --> 01:19:15,496
May God keep you from solitude!

786
01:19:19,576 --> 01:19:22,016
Take your blackboard.

787
01:19:22,736 --> 01:19:25,816
And give me my stick.

788
01:19:25,936 --> 01:19:27,536
Goodbye.

789
01:19:34,336 --> 01:19:37,456
I love you.

790
01:19:44,296 --> 01:19:46,936
Chuan! What are you doing?

791
01:19:47,056 --> 01:19:50,176
Hurry up. Come on.

792
01:19:54,176 --> 01:19:56,696
