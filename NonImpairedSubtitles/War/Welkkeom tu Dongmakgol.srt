September 1950,
in the thick of the Korean War,

4
00:00:55,021 --> 00:01:00,288
Allied Forces led by WWII hero
MacArthur succeed in Incheon Landing.

5
00:01:01,027 --> 00:01:03,791
Most of the Communist People's
Army soldiers

6
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,196
were isolated by this operation
died or hid deep in the mountains.

7
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:12,903
Allied Forces carried out
indiscriminate bombings

8
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,008
to clear out
the People's Army everywhere.

9
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:21,510
Some of these places were
civilian areas, too.

10
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:41,492
Welcome to Dongmakgol

11
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,973
Contact the general.

12
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,085
Yes, sir.

13
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,697
High Comrade.

14
00:03:57,837 --> 00:03:59,805
We can't go on like this.

15
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,288
Give the order, comrade.

16
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,191
High Comrade, let us live!
Let us live!

17
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,199
Let us live, please!

18
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:33,499
High Comrade,
please take me with you.

19
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:38,408
Why aren't you following
orders from Command?

20
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,710
Please take me with you.

21
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:42,305
Comrades!

22
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:43,972
You can't keep doing this.

23
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,483
I can go, I can make it!

24
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:47,608
Look

25
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:49,510
Look!

26
00:04:50,323 --> 00:04:51,915
I can make it alone.

27
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:54,488
I can make it alone.

28
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,056
High Comrade!

29
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,694
One more word out of
you and you're dead.

30
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:19,475
We are taking all of them with us.

31
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,154
Watch out!

32
00:06:03,129 --> 00:06:04,391
Get up!

33
00:06:11,738 --> 00:06:13,296
Comrades!

34
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:32,877
What's your problem?

35
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:35,478
What are you doing? Huh?

36
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:37,782
Mister?

37
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:45,190
Please...

38
00:07:46,732 --> 00:07:48,666
Don't kill me

39
00:07:49,802 --> 00:07:50,996
Please!

40
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:37,776
How will we ever get to
Pyongyang like this?

41
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:41,182
Unless you want to get caught
and killed, follow me.

42
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:46,087
Are you sure we'll make it?

43
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,192
Don't worry.

44
00:08:49,729 --> 00:08:52,095
I'll protect you, no matter...

45
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:06,409
Damn it!

46
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:39,102
We'll move after sunset,
so get some sleep.

47
00:09:55,928 --> 00:09:58,590
I'm Moon Sang-sang.

48
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:01,597
I don't know your story, but, still...

49
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,703
you shouldn't just go and do that!

50
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:10,202
What unit are you from?

51
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,603
I'm real glad to
meet up with you here.

52
00:10:14,647 --> 00:10:16,205
Ex-excuse me?

53
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,586
It's dangerous to go off by yourself!

54
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,790
What was that?

55
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:35,192
- I think it was a person.
- Hey! What is it?

56
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:56,782
There are snakes!

57
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,685
Snakes here.

58
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:05,997
This is a Snake Rock.

59
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:12,001
Was that you just now,
swished past?

60
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,500
You saw?

61
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,200
You saw me!

62
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:16,908
I'm kinda fast.

63
00:11:17,043 --> 00:11:20,206
I'm real strange.
I don't run out of breath...

64
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:23,975
And I swing my arms like this
And my legs get faster,

65
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:28,177
and then
my arms get faster, and then...

66
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:31,982
The ground rushes past, and...

67
00:11:32,124 --> 00:11:37,994
- I'm real fast
- What are you talking about?

68
00:11:38,731 --> 00:11:40,596
Your arms go like that,

69
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,699
- and then your legs get...?
- High Comrade!

70
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:46,700
She has a flower in her hair.

71
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,208
Don't lie here.

72
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:56,405
Snake bites hurt big.

73
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:58,879
They hurt really big!

74
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,079
Don't move!

75
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,688
Still there?

76
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:07,417
Come out of there.

77
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,654
Come on!

78
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,897
Idiots!

79
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,892
Wow! What was that noise?

80
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:46,594
How wonderful!

81
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:51,498
Flowers!

82
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,304
Pretty?

83
00:13:03,115 --> 00:13:04,776
Dumb bitch...

84
00:13:04,917 --> 00:13:07,477
High Comrade!

85
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,087
- Let go! Let go of me!
- Please be calm

86
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,883
I'll kill you too
Let go of me!

87
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:13,582
- Let go of me!
- Calm down, sir!

88
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,284
Where's she going?

89
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,893
Give it here, comrade!

90
00:13:26,539 --> 00:13:29,508
Must be a village here.

91
00:13:30,042 --> 00:13:35,810
Then, maybe the Puppet Army, too?

92
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,375
No way there's any army here.

93
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,881
Shouted with a gun,
but she didn't even blink...

94
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,288
Never seen this kinda thing before.

95
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:50,889
No way there's any army here.

96
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,393
Come over here.

97
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,005
First, we need find the village.

98
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,401
We'll get there and eat

99
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,606
- And get somee food...
- High Comrade!

100
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,976
There might be snakes,
so let's go elsewhere and talk

101
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:26,388
Where are you going?

102
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,000
Didn't you hear there
are snakes?

103
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:31,500
But, we're the People's Army!

104
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,798
People's Army can't get bit and die?

105
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:37,102
We have no bullets.
You wanna pull a grenade?

106
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:41,907
- Look, even High Comrade is going.
- I'm not going for fear of snakes.

107
00:14:43,716 --> 00:14:45,877
Then why are you, sir?

108
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:16,505
What kind of greeting is that?

109
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,981
Thrusting a stick in a man's face

110
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:25,186
Is there really a village
up this way?

111
00:15:25,324 --> 00:15:27,485
You think I'd take you
if there weren't?

112
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:30,095
Geez, this is one tough climb!

113
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,693
We could take
an easier road if you want.

114
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,500
But we'd get there tomorrow.

115
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:51,883
Do you always use that route?

116
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:55,082
We don't come out often.

117
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,778
But a while ago,

118
00:15:56,922 --> 00:16:00,289
this big guy drop down...

119
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,987
He's real sick so I came out
to pick some medicinal herbs.

120
00:16:17,843 --> 00:16:20,107
A village way up here!

121
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,181
This is our village, Dongmakgol.

122
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:33,882
Dongmakgol?

123
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:38,792
They say it's named that so
we'd live carefree, like children.

124
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,696
Live carefree?

125
00:16:44,336 --> 00:16:46,497
I don't know
what's behind it.

126
00:16:46,638 --> 00:16:50,506
Just always been called like that,
since way back.

127
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,987
How are you?

128
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,988
What?

129
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,583
How are you?

130
00:17:42,327 --> 00:17:45,296
How do you think I am?
Uh?

131
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,757
How do you think I am?
Look at me!

132
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,630
I mean, look at me.

133
00:17:54,039 --> 00:17:57,338
I'm tied up with sticks

134
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:00,037
You know I feel like shit!

135
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,612
- Shit!
- Not going well?

136
00:18:03,715 --> 00:18:06,684
It's strange...

137
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,788
You can see,
like it says here, sir...

138
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:13,289
- I can't read that.
- Yes, sir.

139
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:17,256
Well, if I say,
'How are you? '

140
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:22,992
He should say,
'Fine, and you? '

141
00:18:23,135 --> 00:18:25,194
That's the right
American answer...

142
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:29,398
So then I can say,
'I'm fine'

143
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:33,307
Only then is this a completed thing,

144
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,810
but he's a bit...

145
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,474
Why isn't he doing as he should?

146
00:18:40,119 --> 00:18:42,178
Is he picking a fight?

147
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:45,590
Let's try a bit more.

148
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,282
Do you...
Do you speak english?

149
00:18:47,426 --> 00:18:48,791
Village Chief!

150
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,388
Dal-soo's bringing some folks!

151
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,000
From the mountain below!

152
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:59,298
- Where they from?
- Come see!

153
00:18:59,438 --> 00:19:01,599
They've got gourds
on their heads,

154
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:05,198
and real long sticks
in their hands!

155
00:19:06,245 --> 00:19:07,803
Village Chief, come quick!

156
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:21,658
Thank you.

157
00:19:22,027 --> 00:19:23,289
No, no. Wait, wait!

158
00:19:23,428 --> 00:19:27,694
Wait a second, come back here.
Hey come back here, man!

159
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:28,800
Wait, don't go anywhere.
Come back!

160
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:29,901
O... Ok, Ok, Ok.

161
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:33,004
Wait, come back!
Come back!

162
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,577
They got lost, sir.

163
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,879
They're gonna sleep over.

164
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:53,291
We'll just stay a night, sir.

165
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,586
We're good people.

166
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,090
Welcome!

167
00:20:00,132 --> 00:20:02,692
You've come far.

168
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,098
This is our Village Chief.

169
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,904
Have you had something to eat?

170
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,275
How're you feeling?

171
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:22,785
With these herbs,
you'll be up in no time.

172
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:29,287
He's UN, sir.

173
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:43,305
I knew it!

174
00:20:43,442 --> 00:20:45,307
I knew it! I knew you guys would
come to get me.

175
00:20:45,444 --> 00:20:49,210
Thank you so much you guys.
Thank god you guys are here.

176
00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:50,178
Thank god.

177
00:20:50,315 --> 00:20:55,844
My name is Captain Neal Smith
Captain Neal Smith of US Navy

178
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,648
Thank god you guys have come.

179
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:10,259
How come there's only two of you?

180
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,033
Where's the rest of you guys?

181
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:15,806
Do you guys understand me?

182
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:19,508
Hey, where you goin?

183
00:21:19,645 --> 00:21:21,704
Wait, wait! Where you goin?
Come back! Get back here!

184
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:23,280
How did he...?

185
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:27,282
Dropped from the sky,
three or four days ago.

186
00:21:29,154 --> 00:21:30,849
He almost died...

187
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:44,993
How do I look?

188
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:49,338
It's sleeping.
Don't make noise.

189
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:52,899
Be quiet!

190
00:21:53,045 --> 00:21:57,277
My fault, asking a crazy girl.

191
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:08,082
Dong-goo, am I
one of those crazy girls?

192
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:12,059
Is there more than
one crazy girl in our village?

193
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:15,290
You put flowers
in your hair, don't you?

194
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:21,403
- Do lots know beside you?
- Sure.

195
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,673
Just as long as
Teacher Kim doesn't know.

196
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:30,508
He says so,
that you're crazy.

197
00:22:46,131 --> 00:22:47,393
Walk faster!

198
00:22:54,139 --> 00:22:57,802
Snakes not bite
while I was away?

199
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:03,474
Guess not.
You look fine.

200
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,119
It's Teacher Kim!

201
00:23:11,923 --> 00:23:14,483
Well, who's this?

202
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:34,803
It's too noisy.
Shut up, kids!

203
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:38,812
Be quiet!

204
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:43,087
Seems this song never ends.

205
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:46,323
Teacher Kim, why are your hands up?

206
00:23:54,065 --> 00:23:57,193
Something good must be about to
happen in our village.

207
00:23:57,335 --> 00:23:59,735
So many folks from
down the mountain.

208
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,904
How do you know it'll be good?

209
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:09,212
A war?

210
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:13,078
- You say a war's started?
- Yes!

211
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:17,881
Where'd they invade from?
Are they Japs or Chinks?

212
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:21,481
Well, it isn't another country
that invaded...

213
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,788
Wait a minute,
is it another country?

214
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,831
Well the thing is,
our National Army is fighting

215
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:32,895
the Puppet Army from the North!

216
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:41,904
Then, whose side is the
big-nosed guy on?

217
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:48,375
Wife, he must be on this side.
They knew him right off.

218
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,578
That's right.

219
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:54,221
Then it's 2 to 1.
That's not fair!

220
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,490
Well the thing is, you shouldn't
look at it that way, ma'am...

221
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,120
It's the kids!

222
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:03,535
They're all up, coming here.
They should be home.

223
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,561
My goodness, Teacher Kim,
you're right on time.

224
00:25:06,638 --> 00:25:10,301
Say hello.
We have guests from outside.

225
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:13,343
We have guests
over here, too, sir.

226
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:30,094
Sons of bitches, I'll kill you!

227
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:32,196
Don't move or you're dead!

228
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:34,657
Put down the gun, jerk!
Or I'll kill you all!

229
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,901
- Put down the gun
- I'll kill you!

230
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,203
- Son of a bitch!
- Don't move!

231
00:25:44,342 --> 00:25:46,401
Don't move!

232
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:50,743
Get inside!
Take the kids and get inside!

233
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:52,244
Take them inside!

234
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,685
Hey, move!

235
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:02,951
It's alright, folks, don't move!

236
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:06,755
- I said don't move!
- Don't move!

237
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:08,259
Don't move!

238
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,963
You son of a bitche, get off!

239
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:27,013
No army here, you said.

240
00:26:27,118 --> 00:26:29,882
What's up with
all the decisions you make?

241
00:26:30,922 --> 00:26:34,983
They're within ten paces.
Three of us, two of them.

242
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:37,594
- Let's take them!
- Just stay put.

243
00:26:41,232 --> 00:26:44,633
Shit! I told you we shouldn't
come way up here!

244
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:45,896
Hey!

245
00:26:49,341 --> 00:26:51,707
He's calling you.

246
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:56,414
Since you put your finger in the trigger,
then you should pull it.

247
00:26:57,515 --> 00:26:59,073
What's there to think about?

248
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:03,987
Have you forgotten
we've no bullets left?

249
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,590
Don't talk too tough.

250
00:27:08,226 --> 00:27:10,592
Let's take this elsewhere!

251
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:14,887
Are you crazy?
There's... there's three of them!

252
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:18,298
Let's leave these innocent villagers
out of it and let's go elsewhere!

253
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:22,934
- Don't mind us. It's okay.
- Suk-yong.

254
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,197
Listen up closely!

255
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:54,201
Puppet Army and villagers alike,
with one false move...

256
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:57,908
...and you're all dead.

257
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:01,303
I'm serious now.

258
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:13,157
You got them all mad!

259
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:19,686
- Is that a rock?
- It's like a lump of metal

260
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:22,299
What's it for?

261
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:28,501
I'll tell you later,
just do as they say, folks.

262
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:31,708
I asked over here,
not there.

263
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:32,810
God damn it!

264
00:28:32,944 --> 00:28:35,606
You turning your back on
me too, Teacher Kim?

265
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:40,175
- Looks like a potato...
- Damn sons of bitches...

266
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:44,284
Think I'm kidding?

267
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,390
Maybe they painted one of these?

268
00:28:46,524 --> 00:28:49,982
If that's a potato, my wife eats
four of those a day?

269
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,289
Everyone put your hands up!

270
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,590
Yes, sir!

271
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:57,800
Hands up, everyone,
before something happens!

272
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:01,702
- Just one hand?
- Which hand?

273
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:05,901
- What do we do with them up?
- Put them both up, folks.

274
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:09,906
- What will happen?
- Everybody hands up

275
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:15,677
Village Chief!

276
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:25,195
Get up there!

277
00:29:26,698 --> 00:29:29,166
Damn it, get up there quick!

278
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,397
- Come. Come on up here!
- Hurry, hurry.

279
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,466
These folks is all riled up!

280
00:29:35,073 --> 00:29:39,169
Hurry up, hurry!
Hurry, up here!

281
00:29:39,511 --> 00:29:43,914
- Yong-bong, what kept you so late?
- Checking the bee hives, sir.

282
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:45,778
But, we've got bigger troubles!

283
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,915
You should talk with your hands up.

284
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:52,685
Yeah, you should put them up!

285
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:56,191
You know the potato field
next to the hives?

286
00:29:56,327 --> 00:29:58,192
- The one we just planted?
- Yeah, there

287
00:29:58,329 --> 00:30:01,594
Wild boars rooted up a path
right through it!

288
00:30:05,036 --> 00:30:08,494
It doesn't look like it was just
one or two boars.

289
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,203
The year before last,
they went into the cornfield and,

290
00:30:14,345 --> 00:30:15,812
- we starved for a whole month in the winter!
- That's right!

291
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:20,884
Now, now, don't get worked up.
Let's talk it over calmly.

292
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,179
Look here.

293
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,084
Do you not see this?

294
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,090
Worried about stupid boars?

295
00:30:30,228 --> 00:30:33,288
If I open this up, this yard will be
strewn with corpses!

296
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:38,800
But, hey...

297
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:42,907
Are you friends with those guys?

298
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,240
- She's making me crazy...
- Have you eaten?

299
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:04,423
Comrade,
this is a weird village...

300
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,190
Shut up, damn it!

301
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,105
Now what's that?

302
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:18,602
It's a Yankee, sir.

303
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,381
Kicking up a ruckus...

304
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:36,589
Yelling so much I can't sleep!

305
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:39,492
Why don't you just yell in my ear...

306
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:46,434
Get up, Grandma, quit sleeping'?
Rotten offspring!

307
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,198
Look, old lady, don't move!

308
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:51,706
Where should I poo, then.

309
00:31:51,843 --> 00:31:53,310
My mother.

310
00:31:57,649 --> 00:31:59,674
- What do we do about the boars?
- Catch'em

311
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:03,012
- How?
- What're you worried about?

312
00:32:03,154 --> 00:32:04,416
Listen

313
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:08,788
A boar shows up, you grab his neck
with your left hand

314
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,192
Hit him in the eye three times
with your right

315
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,491
Then his eye's will turn all black

316
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:15,997
He goes home like that

317
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:18,398
and tells his friends

318
00:32:18,536 --> 00:32:21,699
Don't go to Dongmakgol!
It's an awful place.

319
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:24,808
Then they'll never come back!

320
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:27,605
If it were you,
got hit thrice in the eye,

321
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:28,905
what would you do?

322
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,777
Take all the boys back with me!

323
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:35,480
Then... then we shouldn't hit them!

324
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:38,487
If they all come back,
we can't get all those eyes.

325
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,595
Damn it...
All of you shut up!

326
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:52,397
Everyone sit down.

327
00:32:54,439 --> 00:32:56,737
You hear me?
All of you, sit!

328
00:32:57,742 --> 00:32:58,800
Let's sit down.

329
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:33,406
- Son of a bitch.
- Son uva-bitch!

330
00:33:34,746 --> 00:33:36,873
- Mother fucker
- Mother fucker...!

331
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:40,473
- Son of a bitch.
- Son uva-bitch!

332
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:43,176
What is it?

333
00:33:43,321 --> 00:33:44,879
The outhouse, sir.

334
00:33:45,423 --> 00:33:47,391
Don't move!

335
00:33:48,926 --> 00:33:51,588
Don't pee your pants.
Come back quick.

336
00:33:57,068 --> 00:34:00,333
Stay in your seat, sir.

337
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:04,907
Gonna check the bee hives,
you stay right here, okay?

338
00:34:05,743 --> 00:34:07,711
- See you.
- Yeah

339
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,468
A ring!

340
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:49,970
You crazy fool!

341
00:35:50,114 --> 00:35:52,173
- Secure it safely!
- Comrade!

342
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:55,479
Idiot,
can't take care of a grenade!

343
00:35:55,686 --> 00:35:57,051
hold still, you!

344
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:09,793
Unless you study hard,
you can never speak Engish

345
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,563
Wasn't it inquisitive when
Teacher talked with the American?

346
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:14,002
Yes!

347
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:17,505
Want to hear what I said to him?

348
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:19,507
- Yes!
- Yes!

349
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:28,177
For instance, if I say, 'How are you? ',
they'd say, 'Fine, and you? '

350
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:32,547
And then I say, 'I'm fine.'

351
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:37,524
And that would be the correct
American answer.

352
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,903
Take cover!

353
00:37:00,451 --> 00:37:04,114
Teacher Kim, what's going on?

354
00:37:49,734 --> 00:37:53,295
Think this is a dud, too?

355
00:40:27,158 --> 00:40:28,318
Moon Sang-sang!

356
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:41,232
Gosh~how... how can you sleep so?
Don't your backs ache?

357
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,888
Not again!
Not again... shit...

358
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:14,998
Now, that's enough.
Come eat something.

359
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:19,007
Don't worry,
this man promised

360
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:22,010
...so rest now.
- He promise?

361
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:26,874
Sir, you don't know
these bastards yet!

362
00:41:33,724 --> 00:41:36,784
If you really want blood...

363
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:41,792
get yourself a sharper tool.

364
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,503
You all sure got vigor.

365
00:41:52,643 --> 00:41:54,304
I'll bring out some food.

366
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:57,606
So go wash your faces.

367
00:41:57,982 --> 00:42:00,678
This is horrible.
The storage room is ruined.

368
00:42:01,051 --> 00:42:04,509
At least the potatoes got well baked.

369
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:07,955
- Are we starving from today?
- Something will happen

370
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:09,786
Don't mind, something will...

371
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:26,307
Sorry there's not much to eat.

372
00:42:26,443 --> 00:42:30,072
They blew up a whole year's
village provisions and you give them our food!

373
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,875
What's taking you?

374
00:42:32,016 --> 00:42:34,484
Just curb your hunger a bit.

375
00:42:34,618 --> 00:42:37,382
Go on, now.
Eat.

376
00:42:37,521 --> 00:42:39,682
What do we live on
when it gets cold?

377
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,089
The storage's empty.

378
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:44,385
Is there really
nothing at all left?

379
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:54,493
- Comrades.
- What?

380
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:09,779
Shouldn't we have gone
with them to the field?

381
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:16,259
What were you thinking,
tossing it there?

382
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:37,575
It's strange...

383
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:40,081
They're just working.

384
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:44,876
High Comrade, how about we just
dig potatoes for a while...

385
00:43:45,155 --> 00:43:48,124
And join up with the main unit
when they come back south?

386
00:43:51,595 --> 00:43:54,462
The bastards might be
up to something.

387
00:43:54,565 --> 00:43:58,023
We can't just dig
potatoes in peace.

388
00:43:58,102 --> 00:43:59,569
High Comrade...

389
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,830
Let's attack first!

390
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:05,570
Just do your work.

391
00:44:10,514 --> 00:44:13,347
They all look like
good folks to me.

392
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:18,951
You don't know anything
about reading people, do you?

393
00:44:19,123 --> 00:44:24,493
Yeah, don't mind about what I say.

394
00:45:13,610 --> 00:45:17,239
We'll fill the storage house.
You can leave the mountain.

395
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:21,284
No good in staying together, is there?

396
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:29,088
Cut the funny talk.
You leave!

397
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,285
Why don't you wanna leave?

398
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:36,593
Take that Yankee down
and you'd get a medal.

399
00:45:36,767 --> 00:45:39,930
Careful on your way, comrade.

400
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:44,303
Down the mountain, People's Army
must be covering the area.

401
00:45:46,577 --> 00:45:52,538
You three are probably the only commie reds
on this entire mountain.

402
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,984
Allied Forces have landed at Incheon.

403
00:45:59,356 --> 00:46:04,487
They've probably pushed up
to Pyongyang by now.

404
00:46:05,129 --> 00:46:09,498
South of that, nothing but
commie corpses scattered below...

405
00:46:09,633 --> 00:46:13,694
- All red!
- Son of a bitch! Quit your crap!

406
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:22,112
You're the ones should be careful.

407
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:31,680
If they've taken Pyongyang...
we're in big trouble.

408
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:37,958
Sergeant, you believe that shit?

409
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:42,392
Then what are those jerks doing
in these rough mountains?

410
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:46,230
It's nonsense.
Don't be taken in by it.

411
00:46:50,941 --> 00:46:55,002
They might've run off from their unit.

412
00:47:01,718 --> 00:47:03,777
Aren't you gonna sleep?

413
00:47:04,521 --> 00:47:06,989
Let's get some sleep.

414
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,519
You wanna get killed in your sleep?

415
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:15,487
If they wanted to, they woulda done it
when we were sleeping before.

416
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,299
Wait a minute!

417
00:47:19,436 --> 00:47:21,961
So why didn't they?

418
00:47:26,977 --> 00:47:29,411
Now the area that
the C8O2 transport plane

419
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,776
went missing is
less than 10 kilometers

420
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:34,577
from where the C520
transport plane went missing.

421
00:47:35,018 --> 00:47:37,077
Now the reconaissance plane that
we sent to the area

422
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:38,882
has disappeard as well.

423
00:47:39,022 --> 00:47:43,083
We can't be sure but we assume
that the remnants of the KPA

424
00:47:43,227 --> 00:47:47,220
with the small anti-aircraft base
is stationed there.

425
00:47:47,598 --> 00:47:51,500
Sir, this is
nothing but an assumption.

426
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:54,729
We need to investigate
the situation further.

427
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:01,406
The problem is geographical.

428
00:48:01,945 --> 00:48:05,073
This is a position
we cannot move or abandon.

429
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:07,274
This is a supply route that
we must secure

430
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:12,150
for amphibious approach
from Ganglion to Wonsan and Changin

431
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:37,575
Gee-whiz... We shouldn't have said
we'd do the work for them.

432
00:48:37,714 --> 00:48:39,375
It'll never be done!

433
00:49:04,741 --> 00:49:06,470
Look here.

434
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:11,080
- How come your face turned all red...
- No way!

435
00:49:12,249 --> 00:49:15,616
I'm just mad we have to be
with those dogs!

436
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:18,183
Hey, jerk...

437
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:21,883
You're bad luck for us, too!

438
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:24,821
- You little jerk...
- Forget about him.

439
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:29,092
It'd just be embarrassing
to take on a little brat like him.

440
00:49:30,934 --> 00:49:34,097
What, a little brat?!

441
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,505
You son of a bitch.

442
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,407
You want to fight?

443
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:45,874
Scared?

444
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:49,410
Yeah... you ought to be scared...

445
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:52,244
That's why you ran away
from your unit.

446
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:58,890
You little bastard...

447
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,862
Let's not make trouble in the village.

448
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:10,506
You wanted it that way.

449
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,946
Taek-gi, go in the room.

450
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:28,691
Son of a bitch...

451
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:32,592
I'll kill you!

452
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,191
Just be calm

453
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:36,897
Son of a...

454
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:39,231
Have you forgotten your promise?

455
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:56,448
Sparrow A1.
Do you copy, over?

456
00:50:59,423 --> 00:51:01,914
Nest, this is Sparrow A1

457
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:05,323
Sparrow A1 down
do you copy over?

458
00:51:05,429 --> 00:51:09,490
What's you name, mister?
I'm Dong-goo. Lee Dong-goo.

459
00:51:18,141 --> 00:51:19,506
Copy, that

460
00:51:20,343 --> 00:51:21,708
Sparrow A1?

461
00:51:21,845 --> 00:51:22,812
You're still alive?

462
00:51:22,946 --> 00:51:25,073
I said I'm Dong-goo!

463
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:29,174
Answer a person
when they talk to you!

464
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,586
Why are you yelling like that?

465
00:51:36,726 --> 00:51:38,387
What's your name?

466
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:43,392
Wanna go some place interesting?

467
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:49,867
Sparrow A1, Sparrow A1?
Sparrow A1!

468
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:53,407
What a strange name!

469
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:57,172
Then your family name is Seu?

470
00:52:05,322 --> 00:52:07,916
- Mr. Seu Miss, run!
- Oh shit!

471
00:52:20,437 --> 00:52:24,100
What happened to your face?

472
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:26,008
Dong-goo?

473
00:52:26,143 --> 00:52:29,408
This big nosed mister,
you know his name?

474
00:52:29,546 --> 00:52:33,573
His name is Seu?
Seu...

475
00:52:33,717 --> 00:52:35,582
That's right!
Seu Miss!

476
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:39,482
Family name's Seu, and
his name is Miss.

477
00:52:39,756 --> 00:52:41,883
Seu Miss?

478
00:52:42,926 --> 00:52:45,895
Seu Miss?

479
00:52:46,029 --> 00:52:47,894
What did you tell them, kid?

480
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:52,991
- Seu Miss?
- yeah, I'm Smith. Yeah, my name.

481
00:52:54,037 --> 00:52:57,200
- Seu Miss!
- What?

482
00:52:57,641 --> 00:53:00,303
- Seu Miss?
- Seu Miss...

483
00:53:03,613 --> 00:53:04,978
What?

484
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:08,284
What's so fun, kid?

485
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:11,785
Make them stop.
Make them stop call my name like that.

486
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:14,681
Seu Miss

487
00:53:15,258 --> 00:53:16,725
Me, Dal-soo!

488
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:19,255
Na... what?

489
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:22,696
His name's Seu Miss?

490
00:53:31,841 --> 00:53:37,780
It's almost 9 years since
Dong-goo's pa left home.

491
00:53:37,914 --> 00:53:42,078
Sure, he wanted to see
the outside world, but...

492
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:46,087
I'm worried sick
Dong-goo will leave, too.

493
00:53:46,223 --> 00:53:52,492
We have to send the outsiders away
before something happens.

494
00:53:52,629 --> 00:53:57,498
If Dong-goo ends up leaving, too,
I'll die!

495
00:54:00,337 --> 00:54:01,702
Fermented bean curd!

496
00:54:18,421 --> 00:54:24,121
I'd be in Jongno
looking good right now...

497
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:29,588
But those fools had to invade.
Now look at me!

498
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,792
Who invaded who?

499
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,869
You're the oneswho put the U.S. up front
and invaded us!

500
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:38,897
Shut up, you don't know anything.

501
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:42,102
You mean we invaded South?

502
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:45,375
Taeki-gi!
That's enough.

503
00:54:45,515 --> 00:54:48,075
That fool keeps telling lies.

504
00:54:48,385 --> 00:54:50,148
Did we invade the South?

505
00:54:51,755 --> 00:54:53,916
We invaded the South.

506
00:54:55,058 --> 00:54:59,154
We did?

507
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:01,861
See, you jerk?

508
00:55:04,167 --> 00:55:09,730
I just went south
because they told me to.

509
00:55:15,345 --> 00:55:20,442
Sparrow A1 down! Sparrow A1 down!
Sparrow A1 down!

510
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:07,395
- Quick, get it!
- Tie it up!

511
01:00:11,708 --> 01:00:12,970
Mother!

512
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:43,801
Thank you so much.

513
01:00:48,945 --> 01:00:50,572
Are you alright?

514
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:52,374
Not a scratch!

515
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:54,444
You're a brave boy!

516
01:01:21,944 --> 01:01:23,309
Second Lieutenant Pyo?

517
01:01:28,017 --> 01:01:32,181
How come these villagers
don't eat meat?

518
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:34,585
It is because it caused them
so much nuisances?

519
01:01:34,724 --> 01:01:36,783
Why did they bury
such a great thing?

520
01:01:37,427 --> 01:01:38,985
Isn't that right,
Second Lieutenant Pyo?

521
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,463
Back on base, they'd call me whenever
there were any pigs to butcher...

522
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,092
Like that one, I would...

523
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:16,698
Have a bite!

524
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:00,766
Good, uh?

525
01:04:20,723 --> 01:04:22,691
Have some more, sir.

526
01:04:22,992 --> 01:04:24,892
This tastes great!

527
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:45,811
Hey, hey, let get inside quick.

528
01:04:52,601 --> 01:04:54,471
Looks good on you.

529
01:06:00,471 --> 01:06:06,241
Been so long since I had fat,
it just shoots right through me.

530
01:06:08,281 --> 01:06:09,941
What's your name?

531
01:06:11,381 --> 01:06:13,541
I'm called Lee Soo-hwa.

532
01:06:23,891 --> 01:06:27,421
The medic comrade calls you
Second Lieutenant Pyo?

533
01:06:34,171 --> 01:06:36,731
Thanks for helping
our comrade before.

534
01:06:47,081 --> 01:06:50,211
How about we just pretend
to be comfortable and friendly?

535
01:07:10,771 --> 01:07:12,431
Let me ask you one thing.

536
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:18,041
When we were sleeping...
why did you let us be?

537
01:07:40,171 --> 01:07:43,631
These are the coordinates
of Captain Smith's last radio transmission.

538
01:07:43,771 --> 01:07:46,041
Now that we can
verify the KPA unit,

539
01:07:46,171 --> 01:07:48,731
there is no reason
to delay the operation.

540
01:07:51,381 --> 01:07:52,641
He's guessing, sir.

541
01:07:52,781 --> 01:07:55,341
I don't think we can make quick
decision based on ambiguous data.

542
01:07:55,481 --> 01:07:57,351
The allied forces
are moving north.

543
01:07:57,491 --> 01:08:00,451
We have to consider the fact that
our winning or loosing depends on

544
01:08:00,521 --> 01:08:02,851
the ability to move
weapons and supplies.

545
01:08:02,991 --> 01:08:04,651
We are over-reacting.

546
01:08:04,791 --> 01:08:06,621
We need more time to investigate

547
01:08:08,861 --> 01:08:11,921
How can you say that.
Obviously, the enemy is there.

548
01:08:13,171 --> 01:08:14,931
There's a chance of
civilian casualty.

549
01:08:15,071 --> 01:08:17,831
We don't have the option
of being sympathetic

550
01:08:17,971 --> 01:08:20,131
And right now,
we don't have the time either.

551
01:08:27,381 --> 01:08:29,351
That is irresponsible.

552
01:08:31,891 --> 01:08:37,451
If we lose this passage, this war will last
much longer than we expected.

553
01:08:37,891 --> 01:08:40,221
China is on the way

554
01:08:46,701 --> 01:08:48,071
You ready man?

555
01:09:03,321 --> 01:09:04,881
You stay here

556
01:09:05,321 --> 01:09:06,581
We run

557
01:09:11,661 --> 01:09:13,391
Hey, stop there!

558
01:09:35,081 --> 01:09:36,551
Where did you get back?

559
01:10:11,291 --> 01:10:14,351
Look here.
There are many curious things.

560
01:10:15,691 --> 01:10:17,751
What is that cloud?

561
01:10:21,331 --> 01:10:23,631
I was big in the U.S. Army Club.

562
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,931
The girls loved me!

563
01:10:29,471 --> 01:10:32,031
Second Lieutenant Pyo, join us!

564
01:10:43,681 --> 01:10:45,241
How is it that...

565
01:10:48,491 --> 01:10:54,221
you have such a hold on the villagers
without ever raising your voice.

566
01:10:57,771 --> 01:11:02,431
What's the secret to
your great leadership?

567
01:11:07,171 --> 01:11:09,641
You just gotta feed them a lot.

568
01:11:11,381 --> 01:11:12,541
Sir?

569
01:12:29,991 --> 01:12:32,651
I can't do it now.
Not now!

570
01:12:35,161 --> 01:12:37,631
You can't make that decision
so easily, sir!

571
01:12:37,771 --> 01:12:40,931
Are you kidding?
You know what needs to be done!

572
01:12:41,071 --> 01:12:43,731
The bridge is full of refugees!

573
01:12:43,871 --> 01:12:47,641
- Shut up and take it down!
- No, I tell you, no!

574
01:12:47,781 --> 01:12:51,541
You son of a bitch!
You want to kill all these people?

575
01:12:51,681 --> 01:12:53,841
- I can't!
- It's an order!

576
01:12:53,981 --> 01:12:55,951
Do it or I'll have you executed!

577
01:12:56,081 --> 01:13:00,651
How am I supposed to
kill all those... all those people?

578
01:13:00,791 --> 01:13:03,851
No! I can't!
How can I kill all of them!

579
01:13:03,991 --> 01:13:07,521
It's over if their tanks get over the Han River!
It's the end, you son of a bitch!

580
01:13:07,901 --> 01:13:10,231
- No way!
- Take it down! Now!

581
01:13:11,431 --> 01:13:13,991
This is an order!
Right now!

582
01:13:51,671 --> 01:13:58,041
Your mission is to rescue
Captain Neel Smith at all costs.

583
01:14:02,381 --> 01:14:06,151
An order is in place
to begin bombing your location,

584
01:14:06,291 --> 01:14:09,551
24 hours after
the mission has begun.

585
01:14:12,891 --> 01:14:17,331
So keep this in mind and
get out of there as soon as possible.

586
01:14:18,171 --> 01:14:20,031
May the lord be with you all.

587
01:14:21,471 --> 01:14:23,131
Dismissed!

588
01:14:23,271 --> 01:14:25,241
Attention!

589
01:14:25,371 --> 01:14:26,531
Salute!

590
01:14:41,291 --> 01:14:45,051
There's a U.S. Army Club
in Jongno...

591
01:14:45,991 --> 01:14:48,331
It's my dream to become
the manager there...

592
01:14:50,361 --> 01:14:54,431
With a girl on each arm.

593
01:14:54,571 --> 01:14:55,931
Wouldn't that be great?

594
01:14:57,171 --> 01:15:00,331
But my father doesn't understand.

595
01:15:00,471 --> 01:15:03,931
You'll know how he feels
when you're a father, too.

596
01:15:04,081 --> 01:15:06,951
You sound just like him.

597
01:15:12,391 --> 01:15:14,351
Can I call you elder brother?

598
01:15:14,491 --> 01:15:17,151
You're too young.
Call me uncle.

599
01:15:17,291 --> 01:15:19,161
Elder brother's better!

600
01:15:19,291 --> 01:15:20,821
You little pup!

601
01:15:20,961 --> 01:15:22,521
Really, it sounds more friendly.

602
01:15:22,661 --> 01:15:25,131
Do as you like~gosh!

603
01:15:25,271 --> 01:15:26,231
- Elder brother?
- What?

604
01:15:26,371 --> 01:15:28,431
I'm curious...

605
01:15:33,771 --> 01:15:35,541
The first day you saw us...

606
01:15:36,481 --> 01:15:38,641
Were you really gonna shoot me?

607
01:15:39,481 --> 01:15:43,041
Yeah, but the truth is,
I didn't have any bullets!

608
01:15:43,181 --> 01:15:45,951
- Fooled you!
- What? What? What did you say?

609
01:15:46,491 --> 01:15:49,251
No wonder you were
shaking like that!

610
01:15:49,391 --> 01:15:52,051
How could I shoot you
without any bullets?

611
01:16:11,551 --> 01:16:13,211
High Comrade!

612
01:16:16,251 --> 01:16:20,411
Once the storage house is full...
are we to leave?

613
01:16:27,361 --> 01:16:28,921
I guess we'd have to.

614
01:16:31,271 --> 01:16:32,931
Where would we go?

615
01:16:34,071 --> 01:16:37,631
If Pyongyang's taken and
the Allies are moving north...

616
01:16:37,771 --> 01:16:39,531
We have no place to go.

617
01:16:42,181 --> 01:16:44,671
Neither do we.

618
01:17:47,571 --> 01:17:49,441
Alright... here comes lunch!

619
01:17:50,281 --> 01:17:51,971
- It's here! It's finally here.
- Yeah!

620
01:17:54,681 --> 01:17:55,841
Oh, you've come

621
01:17:56,051 --> 01:17:58,351
- Be careful now.
- Give it to me!

622
01:17:58,491 --> 01:18:00,451
It's fine, give it here.

623
01:18:05,591 --> 01:18:06,821
Give that to me, ma'am!

624
01:18:14,471 --> 01:18:16,331
They've done so much so soon!

625
01:18:16,471 --> 01:18:19,841
Yes, they're strong.

626
01:18:20,071 --> 01:18:21,941
That's not a good thing...

627
01:18:22,081 --> 01:18:25,841
Now that the storage is full,
they'll say they're leaving.

628
01:18:31,491 --> 01:18:32,851
Thank you very much.

629
01:18:41,261 --> 01:18:43,921
The storage is full,
but we've nowhere to go...

630
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:48,831
Maybe we should find
another grenade.

631
01:18:48,971 --> 01:18:52,431
A good toss into the storage house and
we'd be set for another few months.

632
01:18:52,871 --> 01:18:55,431
It's your fault
for working so hard.

633
01:18:55,581 --> 01:18:58,941
We're supposed to be soldiers, not farmers.
It doesn't look good.

634
01:18:59,481 --> 01:19:03,351
That storage house is too small.

635
01:19:03,481 --> 01:19:06,041
Let's rebuild it bigger.

636
01:19:06,191 --> 01:19:07,741
It's all bullshit.

637
01:19:07,891 --> 01:19:09,551
You're mocking me?

638
01:19:15,261 --> 01:19:17,531
Why don't you sing us a song?

639
01:19:18,071 --> 01:19:20,231
What? A song?

640
01:19:20,401 --> 01:19:22,061
- Yeah, come on.
- Nah!

641
01:19:22,271 --> 01:19:23,671
- Come on, sing us something.
- Come on!

642
01:19:23,941 --> 01:19:26,031
You put him on the spot, now he won't sing!
We shouldn't have put him on it

643
01:19:26,171 --> 01:19:27,331
Right!

644
01:19:27,671 --> 01:19:29,141
Maybe just once.

645
01:19:35,081 --> 01:19:42,651
# A rolling rhythm...
And a sweet melody...

646
01:19:42,791 --> 01:19:50,131
# A boogie song is...
a song of hope.

647
01:19:50,261 --> 01:19:58,231
# Wipe away those sad tears...
Let's move ahead smiling.

648
01:19:58,371 --> 01:20:05,541
# Stop looking surprised...
Let's sing a happy song.

649
01:20:05,681 --> 01:20:09,451
# Let's sing...

650
01:20:09,581 --> 01:20:12,951
# Boogie woogie...

651
01:20:36,081 --> 01:20:39,941
# Let's sing...

652
01:20:40,081 --> 01:20:43,451
# Boogie woogie...

653
01:20:45,751 --> 01:20:47,851
- Seu Miss!
- Seu Miss!

654
01:20:48,091 --> 01:20:50,351
Try this on.

655
01:20:50,491 --> 01:20:53,121
- Will it fit?
- It'll fit.

656
01:20:53,961 --> 01:20:55,721
What if it doesn't?

657
01:20:55,861 --> 01:20:57,191
It's for me?

658
01:20:59,301 --> 01:21:01,561
It fits well!

659
01:21:01,771 --> 01:21:07,041
# I'll move on singing my heart out!

660
01:21:08,581 --> 01:21:10,441
That was great!

661
01:21:13,981 --> 01:21:15,451
Here some drink

662
01:21:15,981 --> 01:21:18,851
What a good voice!

663
01:21:19,021 --> 01:21:22,681
- That's good. More, please!
- Yo, you are a drinker!

664
01:21:55,291 --> 01:21:56,451
Here some drink

665
01:21:57,621 --> 01:22:01,921
I guess we'll have to go
our separate ways.

666
01:22:03,161 --> 01:22:07,071
Although if we were to meet again in
another war we'd have to use our guns again.

667
01:22:11,271 --> 01:22:13,241
We won't meet again.

668
01:22:19,081 --> 01:22:20,741
I deserted.

669
01:22:23,281 --> 01:22:25,551
If I go back,
it's the firing squad for me.

670
01:22:27,391 --> 01:22:29,451
Since I can't go back to my unit...

671
01:22:30,191 --> 01:22:32,351
we won't be using guns
on each other.

672
01:22:52,381 --> 01:22:53,571
Look at them.

673
01:22:55,881 --> 01:22:57,851
Such a good time.

674
01:22:57,981 --> 01:22:59,351
That's life.

675
01:23:31,691 --> 01:23:34,551
OK, listen up! It's time.

676
01:23:35,691 --> 01:23:37,851
Four minutes before drop.

677
01:23:39,191 --> 01:23:41,631
Now we will be landing
on the hot zone

678
01:23:41,761 --> 01:23:44,031
and the enemy will
outnumber us.

679
01:23:44,161 --> 01:23:47,621
They will not hesitate
to kill us violently.

680
01:23:47,871 --> 01:23:52,601
So let's be prepared
to land on the ground with the rifles firing.

681
01:23:54,211 --> 01:23:57,041
All right gentlemen, good luck.

682
01:23:59,781 --> 01:24:01,751
I'll see you on the ground.

683
01:24:03,881 --> 01:24:07,651
Go! Go! Go!

684
01:24:08,521 --> 01:24:11,081
Get your rifle.
Go! Go!

685
01:25:45,091 --> 01:25:47,451
Nest 1, this is Macpie A2

686
01:25:47,591 --> 01:25:50,561
After drop zone,
only five survived.

687
01:25:50,691 --> 01:25:53,521
Current coordinates,
Delta Hotel 4045

688
01:25:53,661 --> 01:25:57,321
We found the wild dog,
we found the wild dog.

689
01:27:37,361 --> 01:27:40,731
- He's looking at us.
- Then greet him!

690
01:27:40,871 --> 01:27:42,601
I don't think that's it.

691
01:27:42,741 --> 01:27:48,111
If you meet a man's eyes,
you greet them!

692
01:27:48,241 --> 01:27:49,301
Come on, let's!

693
01:27:50,681 --> 01:27:52,441
Welcome!

694
01:27:55,421 --> 01:27:56,641
He's smiling.

695
01:27:56,921 --> 01:27:58,881
You think I'm fucking around.

696
01:28:00,591 --> 01:28:02,491
You think I'm fucking around?

697
01:28:02,921 --> 01:28:04,651
You think I'm playing games?

698
01:28:15,171 --> 01:28:18,431
Your fuck'n communist bastards
are driving my patience thin.

699
01:28:19,071 --> 01:28:22,131
I told you we shouldn't!

700
01:28:22,941 --> 01:28:24,411
Damn it!

701
01:28:52,611 --> 01:28:54,001
You bitch!

702
01:28:54,341 --> 01:28:56,331
You know what happens
when you get shot in the head?

703
01:28:56,541 --> 01:28:57,871
Spill it!

704
01:28:58,081 --> 01:29:00,051
Where are all the commie reds hiding?

705
01:29:04,621 --> 01:29:06,411
Damn girl, I'll kill you!

706
01:29:06,591 --> 01:29:07,991
She's crazy!

707
01:29:08,251 --> 01:29:10,311
You don't treat
a crazy girl like that!

708
01:29:25,871 --> 01:29:29,771
You sound like a Northerner.

709
01:29:31,581 --> 01:29:32,741
Uh?

710
01:29:35,481 --> 01:29:37,351
Sure you're from this village?

711
01:29:42,491 --> 01:29:44,151
Who are your parents?

712
01:29:49,061 --> 01:29:51,121
Has this kid no parents?

713
01:29:56,871 --> 01:29:58,531
- He's my son!
- He's mine!

714
01:30:12,391 --> 01:30:13,911
Why you...!

715
01:30:50,861 --> 01:30:52,521
He's this boy's father!

716
01:30:52,891 --> 01:30:53,721
Father!

717
01:30:53,861 --> 01:30:55,051
What do you want?

718
01:30:55,191 --> 01:30:56,751
fuck are they saying?

719
01:30:57,401 --> 01:30:58,891
It's father

720
01:31:07,671 --> 01:31:11,131
What are you so upset about?

721
01:31:11,581 --> 01:31:13,241
Why don't you calm down?

722
01:31:13,381 --> 01:31:15,941
Who do you think you are, bastard?

723
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:19,241
Seat your fucking as down

724
01:31:21,491 --> 01:31:24,551
Are you bastards playing with us?

725
01:31:25,891 --> 01:31:29,731
Has anyone among you seen any
commie reds or anti-aircraft guns?

726
01:31:32,471 --> 01:31:34,431
Come forward!

727
01:31:35,371 --> 01:31:37,131
No one?

728
01:31:56,491 --> 01:31:59,051
Still no one?
Damned dogs...

729
01:32:01,461 --> 01:32:05,121
Listen up and watch closely...

730
01:32:07,071 --> 01:32:13,131
Until someone comes forward,
one by one, I'm gonna kill you all!

731
01:32:56,581 --> 01:32:57,641
Back off!

732
01:32:57,781 --> 01:33:00,151
No, wait, don't!
Please...

733
01:33:00,351 --> 01:33:01,821
Don't move!

734
01:33:03,291 --> 01:33:05,151
Don't move, asshole!

735
01:33:11,561 --> 01:33:13,231
Wait, just a second.

736
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:24,641
Come on!

737
01:33:24,781 --> 01:33:26,751
Tie that bastard up!

738
01:33:28,481 --> 01:33:31,041
Village Chief, are you alright?

739
01:33:34,391 --> 01:33:35,851
Yeo-il!

740
01:33:38,191 --> 01:33:40,021
Yeo-il!
Yeo-il!

741
01:33:40,831 --> 01:33:42,291
What do we do?

742
01:33:44,131 --> 01:33:45,791
Dear, what do we do?

743
01:33:45,971 --> 01:33:47,231
Yeo-il!

744
01:33:48,631 --> 01:33:49,731
Hey, hey?

745
01:33:51,971 --> 01:33:53,841
It's hot...

746
01:33:54,571 --> 01:33:55,941
Yeo-il!

747
01:33:56,381 --> 01:33:58,041
Hot here.

748
01:34:00,151 --> 01:34:02,341
Yeo-il, Yeo-il!

749
01:34:08,051 --> 01:34:09,851
Hurts big...

750
01:34:12,261 --> 01:34:13,421
Yeo-il!

751
01:34:16,661 --> 01:34:17,821
Yeo-il!

752
01:34:20,671 --> 01:34:23,761
Child?

753
01:36:40,271 --> 01:36:41,641
Moon Sang-sang.

754
01:36:41,771 --> 01:36:44,641
- Search him.
- Yes, sir. Hold this, please.

755
01:36:46,281 --> 01:36:46,941
Stay still!

756
01:36:47,081 --> 01:36:50,541
What did you want up
in these mountains?

757
01:36:57,991 --> 01:36:59,251
What's this?

758
01:37:00,361 --> 01:37:02,521
We'll all die together...

759
01:37:02,661 --> 01:37:05,321
How's that?
Alright?

760
01:37:06,971 --> 01:37:10,031
It'll be a sight to see
if they drop it all here.

761
01:37:10,171 --> 01:37:12,541
It's just villagers here!

762
01:37:14,271 --> 01:37:16,241
Tell the truth...

763
01:37:18,081 --> 01:37:19,441
Why'd you come?

764
01:37:20,381 --> 01:37:22,351
Talk, bastard!

765
01:37:22,481 --> 01:37:25,541
Never mind asking him.
Let's just bury him alive.

766
01:37:25,681 --> 01:37:28,451
Smith, hit him again with a rock!

767
01:37:29,391 --> 01:37:32,151
Did you call him Smith?

768
01:37:33,761 --> 01:37:35,621
How the hell do you
know my name?

769
01:37:37,161 --> 01:37:38,821
Are you Smith?

770
01:37:39,831 --> 01:37:40,921
You?

771
01:37:41,871 --> 01:37:45,671
- Is that right?
- Yeah. yeah, how do you know my name?

772
01:37:58,381 --> 01:38:02,651
How in the world did things

773
01:38:07,891 --> 01:38:09,051
Hey, guys.

774
01:38:13,771 --> 01:38:15,321
I found something.

775
01:38:30,981 --> 01:38:37,551
Shouldn't this be enough
to decoy the bomb raid?

776
01:38:41,261 --> 01:38:44,231
It's not enough, but...

777
01:38:44,961 --> 01:38:47,631
If we work altogether,
it wouldn't be totally impossible

778
01:38:48,671 --> 01:38:51,031
What do you mean?

779
01:38:51,171 --> 01:38:52,931
Work together on what?

780
01:38:53,871 --> 01:38:56,841
We know what would happen here,
you can't just sit by.

781
01:38:58,381 --> 01:39:02,141
We're third parties.
Why don't we mind our business...

782
01:39:02,281 --> 01:39:04,251
and just leave the village?

783
01:39:08,391 --> 01:39:10,651
Don't give me any orders.

784
01:39:11,291 --> 01:39:13,521
We're not from the same unit.

785
01:39:14,261 --> 01:39:16,021
I'll do as I want.

786
01:39:19,271 --> 01:39:20,731
High Comrade?

787
01:39:24,371 --> 01:39:26,631
We'd just decoy the bomb attack.

788
01:39:27,771 --> 01:39:30,371
We fire some warning shots and run.

789
01:39:31,281 --> 01:39:32,741
Nothing to it.

790
01:39:37,281 --> 01:39:38,651
Sang-sang, you think...

791
01:39:40,491 --> 01:39:45,951
if you run away now and live,
you'll be at ease?

792
01:39:47,461 --> 01:39:51,231
You'd regret it all your life
and probably go crazy.

793
01:39:51,761 --> 01:39:53,821
I'd rather go crazy.

794
01:39:53,971 --> 01:39:57,631
You want to die like hell,
so it doesn't matter for you.

795
01:39:59,471 --> 01:40:01,941
But I'm not
interested at all!

796
01:40:09,981 --> 01:40:11,351
High Comrade

797
01:40:14,191 --> 01:40:16,751
You know how we got here.

798
01:40:17,691 --> 01:40:20,521
The wounded
and women comrades...

799
01:40:20,661 --> 01:40:23,131
I killed all those
that couldn't keep up.

800
01:40:25,861 --> 01:40:28,631
How do I face my family
back home?

801
01:40:28,971 --> 01:40:32,031
That was on orders
from Command.

802
01:40:32,171 --> 01:40:35,331
How many people did we kill
on the way here?

803
01:40:36,281 --> 01:40:38,441
We can repay that debt now.

804
01:40:42,481 --> 01:40:43,951
Moon Sang-sang.

805
01:40:44,981 --> 01:40:47,041
I'm not going!

806
01:40:48,391 --> 01:40:49,851
If my family...

807
01:40:50,991 --> 01:40:53,121
Even if it were my own family
I couldn't do it.

808
01:41:04,371 --> 01:41:06,131
What are you waiting for, guys?

809
01:41:28,561 --> 01:41:30,321
Everything's screwed up!

810
01:41:50,881 --> 01:41:52,151
This operation...

811
01:41:54,091 --> 01:41:56,951
how about Second Lieutenant Pyo
leading it?

812
01:42:01,861 --> 01:42:05,521
These damn weapons are
too new to me.

813
01:42:06,971 --> 01:42:08,731
Which, which is the front?

814
01:42:40,371 --> 01:42:46,241
Wretched offspring... Shouldn't come
if you're gonna leave.

815
01:42:47,271 --> 01:42:50,641
Blowing up all the corn...

816
01:43:32,181 --> 01:43:33,451
Look here!

817
01:43:47,471 --> 01:43:49,631
It'll be cold three or four days.

818
01:44:01,781 --> 01:44:03,541
Are you comin' back?

819
01:44:14,831 --> 01:44:16,731
Mister Seu Miss!

820
01:45:35,571 --> 01:45:36,731
I have a favor to ask...

821
01:45:37,511 --> 01:45:40,411
Go back to your base with Smith.

822
01:45:42,381 --> 01:45:46,941
Smith, he asked me
to go back to the base with you.

823
01:45:48,291 --> 01:45:49,451
What?

824
01:45:50,391 --> 01:45:52,151
The base?

825
01:45:53,861 --> 01:45:57,921
No, I'm going
with you guys.

826
01:45:58,261 --> 01:46:00,321
We can try this once,

827
01:46:00,471 --> 01:46:02,831
but If they attack
the second time, it's over.

828
01:46:03,571 --> 01:46:05,931
Dongmakgol is in your hands.

829
01:46:06,071 --> 01:46:08,041
They'll believe you if you tell them.

830
01:46:09,011 --> 01:46:12,441
If the 2nd attack is hapenning,
there is no turning back.

831
01:46:12,641 --> 01:46:16,381
They're going to believe your word.

832
01:46:28,061 --> 01:46:30,431
I guess I don't have
much of a choice, do I?

833
01:46:37,671 --> 01:46:39,141
Take this.

834
01:46:52,681 --> 01:46:54,281
It's been good luck for me.

835
01:47:01,291 --> 01:47:02,991
Take care, guys!

836
01:47:07,831 --> 01:47:12,241
Their bombers will pass over us
at about 18:00.

837
01:47:14,971 --> 01:47:16,341
When they discover us...

838
01:47:16,481 --> 01:47:21,341
We have to expose ourselves to
look like an anti-aircraft base.

839
01:47:27,391 --> 01:47:29,751
The flight path on the map...

840
01:47:30,291 --> 01:47:33,421
says they'll come
from that area in this direction.

841
01:47:33,861 --> 01:47:36,421
Your holes should be facing
11 o'clock and...

842
01:47:36,561 --> 01:47:41,231
MG50 and MG30 should be placed
here and here.

843
01:47:42,371 --> 01:47:43,561
Next, Sergeant Jang...

844
01:47:44,171 --> 01:47:47,141
Set up the lanterns you brought...

845
01:47:47,271 --> 01:47:50,241
To light up the decoy tents to look
like a village.

846
01:47:50,381 --> 01:47:52,041
They'll believe
it's an anti-aircraft base.

847
01:47:52,681 --> 01:47:57,141
Just in case this place
doesn't get noticed...

848
01:47:59,281 --> 01:48:01,651
wire the TNT underground, too.

849
01:48:15,471 --> 01:48:18,531
No one's gonna care we did this.

850
01:48:19,171 --> 01:48:21,641
It's not too late.
Let's just leave!

851
01:48:21,771 --> 01:48:23,931
That's enough out of you little pup!

852
01:48:32,151 --> 01:48:34,411
You've got good
command capability.

853
01:48:38,091 --> 01:48:40,121
You all helped so well.

854
01:48:42,661 --> 01:48:44,631
Why'd you yield command to me?

855
01:48:53,471 --> 01:48:56,441
I'm not suited to the vanguard.

856
01:48:59,581 --> 01:49:02,241
The war started and
everyone in my unit died...

857
01:49:04,481 --> 01:49:07,751
I got a commanding rank
for surviving alone.

858
01:49:12,591 --> 01:49:14,621
You're a born leader.

859
01:49:18,561 --> 01:49:20,121
Does it look that way?

860
01:49:22,171 --> 01:49:23,531
That's good.

861
01:49:31,481 --> 01:49:33,031
Listen to me!

862
01:49:33,181 --> 01:49:36,641
How can the five of us stop
a plane in the sky?

863
01:49:41,691 --> 01:49:44,451
Everyone to their positions!
We don't have time!

864
01:49:44,591 --> 01:49:47,721
- You said there was time!
- Shut up and get moving!

865
01:50:08,481 --> 01:50:09,951
Until the bomber...

866
01:50:10,881 --> 01:50:15,651
is within shooting range
we must stay put!

867
01:50:17,991 --> 01:50:19,151
Elder brother.

868
01:50:21,161 --> 01:50:22,721
Come on over here!

869
01:50:24,931 --> 01:50:27,691
Little pup, scared?

870
01:50:31,871 --> 01:50:33,571
Stay here.

871
01:50:39,981 --> 01:50:41,741
Moon Sang-sang.

872
01:50:43,051 --> 01:50:46,581
Sing that song again
from yesterday.

873
01:50:47,391 --> 01:50:49,751
You want me to sing here, now?

874
01:50:52,491 --> 01:50:54,521
Come on, try!

875
01:51:01,971 --> 01:51:06,031
# A rolling rhythm...

876
01:51:07,271 --> 01:51:10,641
# And a sweet melody...

877
01:51:13,681 --> 01:51:16,941
# A boogie song is...

878
01:51:19,581 --> 01:51:22,551
# a song of hope.

879
01:51:24,591 --> 01:51:28,921
# Wipe away those sad tears...

880
01:51:35,431 --> 01:51:37,831
Eagle2, Report current status over.

881
01:51:38,041 --> 01:51:39,231
Roger

882
01:51:39,771 --> 01:51:43,231
We don't see any enemy movement
at the current position, over.

883
01:52:08,771 --> 01:52:09,931
By the way...

884
01:52:11,571 --> 01:52:15,131
Aren't we allied forces, too?

885
01:52:18,881 --> 01:52:22,441
We're a North-South Joint Force,
aren't we?

886
01:52:23,381 --> 01:52:25,141
Am I wrong?

887
01:52:25,281 --> 01:52:29,151
You can joke
at a time like this?

888
01:52:29,291 --> 01:52:30,551
That makes sense!

889
01:52:37,761 --> 01:52:39,531
Instead of like this...

890
01:52:41,571 --> 01:52:47,061
If we had met somewhere else
some other way...

891
01:52:47,471 --> 01:52:50,241
We would have had real fun.

892
01:52:51,511 --> 01:52:52,941
Don't you think so?

893
01:53:05,491 --> 01:53:06,921
It's now!

894
01:53:31,281 --> 01:53:33,051
I think that was enough.

895
01:53:33,181 --> 01:53:35,551
Yeah, that should be enough.

896
01:53:35,721 --> 01:53:37,211
Then let's run!

897
01:53:47,171 --> 01:53:49,531
Damn it, they didn't see us!

898
01:53:55,171 --> 01:53:56,641
Nest A-1, Nest A-1

899
01:53:56,781 --> 01:53:58,641
This is Sparrow05

900
01:53:58,781 --> 01:54:02,941
From our current position,
we have detected enemy movements.

901
01:54:03,251 --> 01:54:06,121
I'm on my way down.
Check it out, over.

902
01:54:14,591 --> 01:54:16,061
Gottcha

903
01:55:15,591 --> 01:55:16,851
Taek-gi!

904
01:56:13,281 --> 01:56:14,441
Sang-sang!

905
01:57:29,191 --> 01:57:30,951
Hurry, come on.

906
01:57:36,131 --> 01:57:37,321
Take cover!

907
01:57:50,381 --> 01:57:52,241
Come on, enough already!

908
01:59:42,591 --> 01:59:44,451
Elder brother!
Elder Brother!

909
01:59:47,861 --> 01:59:49,021
Brother!

910
01:59:49,731 --> 01:59:50,891
Brother!

911
01:59:54,571 --> 01:59:55,731
Elder brother!

912
01:59:59,671 --> 02:00:01,231
Little pup!

913
02:00:04,481 --> 02:00:07,141
I'm... fine...

914
02:00:17,391 --> 02:00:18,861
Elder brother...

915
02:00:50,391 --> 02:00:53,021
You damn bastards!

916
02:01:07,211 --> 02:01:10,041
Take cover!
Take cover!

917
02:01:10,171 --> 02:01:11,541
Take cover!

918
02:02:06,561 --> 02:02:08,931
One minute to drop zone, deadline.

919
02:02:13,471 --> 02:02:16,531
Nest A-1, Nest A-1.
We are in hot zone.

920
02:02:16,671 --> 02:02:20,441
Repeat EO 1,2
and 3 are in the hot zone.

921
02:02:20,881 --> 02:02:23,371
Mission has been initiated.

922
02:02:24,181 --> 02:02:26,011
One minute to engage.
