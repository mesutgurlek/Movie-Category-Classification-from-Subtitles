of coral in the Solomon Archipelago.

It is nameless, and the great war
beyond its horizons ignores us,

3
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:05,122
for we are the expendables
of an amphibious landing,

of the Imperial Japanese Army.

Months ago our communicational
equipment was destroyed by storm.

We have no contact with our base.

two enemies at war with each other.

of ancient warriors in his veins

men 's works and not their destruction.

00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:39,025
As the commander
of this platoon of castaways,

11
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,925
I have ordered the construction of a boat,

12
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:45,726
hoping to restore our supply line
from Bougainville.

You think you can stab Yankees like that?

Today I will chew you out until you fall!

Yes, Sergeant. Thank you very much.

(SPEAKING JAPANESE) Sergeant Tamura!

22
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:29,107
I have told you these
rough methods are not permitted here.

23
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:33,112
But, sir, these lazy scum
can't fight a war like this.

24
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,648
We are on the foremost war front.

25
00:03:35,916 --> 00:03:41,377
You are right, but we have
no enemy on this island.

26
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:46,689
What we need here
is not to know how to fight,

27
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,921
but how to stand the long war.

28
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:54,299
But, sir, we have forgotten that we are
the Imperial Army soldiers.

29
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,398
Soldiers?

30
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,804
Tamura, and just what are the soldiers?

31
00:03:58,872 --> 00:04:03,502
The countless varieties of ordinary men
blown together by the big wind called war.

Tokumaru was a Buddhist priest.

I still am, sir.

for three days you can never stop it.

00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:14,015
Is military service hard for you?

36
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,850
No, it isn't, sir, if it is for our country.

37

AII right, keep it up.

38
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:19,614
Yes, sir.

39
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,228
You cannot be like this next time.

40
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:35,240

until you fall. Dismissed!

You are making good progress.

If only we have this boat we can contact
our main force and bring us supplies.

47
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:02,532
I'm really glad
that I can make use of my carpentry work.

48

To be useful is a most important thing.

49

do such fine work with makeshift tools.

-Say, Tamura!
-Yes, sir!

52
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,678
Sergeant, I notice two men here
who are assigned to other duties.

53
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,277
Hirano and Okuda.

54
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:24,846
Yes, sir, but I thought the boat
construction needs are urgent.

55
00:05:25,358 --> 00:05:26,848
You thought!

56
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:30,363
Hirano is busy with potato fields and
Okuda catches fish for us.

57
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,455
Take them off the boat detail.

58
00:05:32,532 --> 00:05:34,466
Yes, sir. As you wish, sir.

59
00:05:36,203 --> 00:05:38,603
And one more thing.

60
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:42,199
Don't overwork the men in this midday
heat. Dismiss them until morning.

Attention! Detail dismissed for the day!

We can launch the boat tomorrow.

Corporal, I understand
you are from Yamagata.

66
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:20,542
Yes, Yamagata is noted for rice and
the Hanagasa 'flower hat' dance song.

67
00:06:20,614 --> 00:06:23,310
Shall we start Bon dance?

the urgency of boat building

while on the other hand
you act as though time is nothing.

That's true.
This place is as timeless as the moon.

No, sir, I have forgotten.

00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:22,239
I only know I am being abandoned
by the main force.

77

moving to distant places northward.

00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:46,045
Looks Like a dislocation.

156
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:02,623
(YELLS)

157
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:03,999
Damn you!

158
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,033
-Okay, pal.
-Thanks.

159
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,502
Searcy, what's the matter?

160
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,045
Oh, I figure I got me
a hunk of packing case in my back, Doc.

161
00:15:15,882 --> 00:15:19,215
Nothing up my sleeve, Hoxie boy.
Deal you a hand?

162
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:22,986
Not now, slicker.
You're already into me for 1,000 bucks.

163
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:26,456
You know that's peanuts to this guy?
Why, his old man owns Rhode Island!

164
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:27,515
(SCREAMS IN PAIN)

165
00:15:28,828 --> 00:15:31,353
We passed over Guadalcanal about 1000.

166
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:37,100
So that should place us right about here.

167
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:40,929
There's no island here on the map.

168
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,506
Corpsman, I presume
the Captain radioed the base?

169
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:47,842
They'd know where to pick us up?

170
00:15:47,914 --> 00:15:51,475
I couldn't say.
But maybe that'll answer your question.

171
00:15:55,154 --> 00:15:58,817
-That's a radio.
-Or what used to be a radio.

172
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,820
-Then the base don't know we're here, huh?
-No, but relax, relax. I'll fix it.

173
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:09,527
Him? That punk's so stupid,
he couldn't fix a busted shoelace.

174
00:16:09,602 --> 00:16:13,163
That's the pilot's responsibility. Captain!

175
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:18,404
Hey, hey, Lieutenant. Nowadays
I wouldn't advise any yelling in any jungle

176
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,571
anywhere west
of the International Date Line.

177
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:25,310
You mean Japs? No.
No such luck around this strip of nowhere.

178
00:16:25,384 --> 00:16:28,478
No strategic value.
Probably not even inhabited.

179
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,454
Captain!

180
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:41,061
-We got company, sir.
-Japanese.

181
00:16:41,534 --> 00:16:44,469
-Point's broken off, but it ain't even rusted.
-No.

182
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:49,333
No, this looks Like a fishing spear.
I found a footpath back in there,

183
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,000
followed it down to a cove.

184
00:16:51,077 --> 00:16:54,945
Join the Jap Army and go fishing.
Is that all them skivvies got to do?

185
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:58,780
Now we bypassed this position Long ago
when we landed on Bougainville.

186
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:01,911
Plumb cut 'em off, huh, sir?
What's the name of the place?

187
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:06,188
Meet the neighbors, you can ask them.

188
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,993
Japanese.

189
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,629
That blade's Japanese, all right.

190
00:17:15,701 --> 00:17:16,929
-You men see it?
-ALL: Yeah.

191
00:17:17,303 --> 00:17:20,397
Well, looks Like we found some action
after all.

192
00:17:20,473 --> 00:17:22,202
-Thank you, men. What I want you to do...
-Lieutenant.

193
00:17:22,275 --> 00:17:24,470
You got any orders
to mop up wayside islands?

194
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,636
Certainly not, sir. It's just a matter...

195
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:27,144
I just wondered.
You said you go by the book.

196
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:29,704
Yes, sir, but this is one of those matters
of judgment. AII right!

197
00:17:30,449 --> 00:17:33,577
Every man in combat condition,
want you to grab your weapons

198
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:34,711
and let's move! On the double!

199
00:17:34,787 --> 00:17:35,811
(MEN MURMURING IN ASSENT)

200
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:38,880
Unless they're in force, there won't
be a dirty Jap around tonight.

201
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,621
Dirty Jap, Lieutenant?
They invented the bathtub.

202
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:48,059
Why... You talk Like a bird
who's gone Asiatic.

203
00:17:48,134 --> 00:17:51,399
You can say that again, sir.
I been close to the top brass, see?

204
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:53,700
And I got the scuttlebutt on this stew bum.

205
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,741
He wouldn't come out of the reserve
till Singapore fell

206
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,901
'cause he was shacked up
with some Malay dame.

207
00:17:57,977 --> 00:18:01,572
Oh, Sergeant, that kind of crude language
will get you nowhere socially.

208
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,012
I was her houseguest.

209
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:07,083
Everybody ready?
Count 'em off, Sergeant. Let's move!

210
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:12,521
-Fall in!
-Now you wait just a second, Captain!

211
00:18:12,959 --> 00:18:14,824
You trying to take over my command?

212
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:17,590
No, I'm just trying to help you keep it alive.
Attention!

213
00:18:18,698 --> 00:18:22,566
Corporal, pick yourself another man
and get out there and keep your eyes open.

214
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:24,262
CRADDOCK: Yes, sir. Searcy!
SEARCY: Yo!

215
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:31,375
Now listen to this!
You, Lieutenant, and you, Sergeant!

216
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,914
I want to tell you
a little something about the enemy.

217
00:18:36,549 --> 00:18:39,882
Aside from the few fanatics,
he's a cool cookie.

218
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,853
And on this island
he's on his home grounds.

219
00:18:43,556 --> 00:18:45,922
He knows the terrain, you don't.

220
00:18:49,395 --> 00:18:53,957
So we give him the courtesy
of making the first move. And get this!

221
00:18:55,835 --> 00:18:59,236
Never start swinging at any enemy in anger
or you’ll wind up getting clobbered.

222
00:19:00,272 --> 00:19:02,069
Now you ought to know that, Sergeant.

223
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:05,372
These gravediggers tell me you're
the heavyweight champ in your division.

224
00:19:05,444 --> 00:19:08,140
Yeah, when I fight, I fight mad.

225
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:12,048
Now you said you were close
to the top brass. Kind of pampered, huh?

226
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:15,087
Yeah, and I got the scuttlebutt on you, too.
You were a scrap pilot.

227
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:19,284
Landed on your head just once too often.
In the hospital for weeks.

228
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:21,849
Well, I was more comfortable there
than you're gonna be in the brig.

229
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:22,951
What brig?

230
00:19:23,029 --> 00:19:24,621
You're gambling we're stuck here
for the duration.

231
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:27,188
Jungle law. No military court to answer to.
Well, I got news for you.

232
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:28,961
-Lieutenant.
-You're the one who'll be held to answer,

233
00:19:29,035 --> 00:19:31,663
sir, if you break the chain of command.

234
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:37,198
Well, Lieutenant, it seems you haven't
read your Bible as well as you claim.

235
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:41,770
Article 9, page 33,
and I quote, "Any military personnel

236
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,077
"assigned to the care and custody
of the commanding officer

237
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:47,711
"of any military transport,
whether seaborne or airborne,

238
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,720
"shall obey all orders
of said commanding officer

239
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,655
"until arrival at destination." Unquote.

240
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:56,183
-I'll look that up in my handbook, sir.
-AII right, understand this, all of you.

241
00:19:57,563 --> 00:19:59,554
The chain of command will remain as is.

242
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,897
Your platoon leader is Lieutenant Blair.

243
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:08,135
He'll consult with his superior officer
on all matters of policy.

244
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,468
Me.

245
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:14,941
AII right, at ease, men.

246
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,312
-Sergeant Bleeker.
-Yes, sir.

247
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:22,044
-See that hill in back of me?
-Yeah, I see it.

248
00:20:22,121 --> 00:20:24,919
That's where we'll locate
our base and defense.

249
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,016
And as of now you're captain of the head,
so start digging.

250
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,088
-Me?
-You!

251
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:36,033
You feel Like gambling, Sergeant?
Go right ahead, go for broke.

252
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,738
You the Ozark mountain boy I talked to?

253
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:45,504
Yes, sir. Corporal Craddock.

254
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:47,944
AII right, Craddock, you're my chief scout.

255
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,481
Tonight I'll go on your first mission
with you.

256
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,176
Much obliged, skipper.

257
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,879
Now, Lieutenant, have your men
pack the supplies up the hill,

258
00:20:54,954 --> 00:20:56,615
start setting up our defense.

259
00:20:56,689 --> 00:21:00,022
And as of now we start conserving
food and water. Our supplies are limited.

260
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:05,927
Sir. Fall out and turn to!
You heard the command.

261
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:09,694
You got any more policy, sir?

262
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,704
You start learning to fight with your brains
instead of your feelings.

263
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,364
I want to whip the enemy
as much as you do.

264
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,238
Not because he's Japanese,
but because he is the enemy.

265
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:21,109
Now that's policy, Lieutenant.
Now one thing more.

266
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,378
In combat you’ll live a lot longer not being
saluted or wearing your insignia of rank.

267
00:21:25,451 --> 00:21:28,045
The enemy likes to kill off the officers
and non-coms first,

268
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,486
breaks up the chain of command.

269
00:21:30,556 --> 00:21:32,114
Thank you, sir.

270
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:44,224
MALONEY: Mmm.

271
00:21:45,871 --> 00:21:47,236
Conserve the water?

272
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,036
That's the best news I've heard
since we whipped the Japanese at Midway.

273
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,610
-Want a drink?
-Go easy on that stuff, Francis.

274
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,203
we'll need whiskey for medicine.

275
00:21:55,281 --> 00:21:58,614
You just saved me
about a dozen future patients over there.

276
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:02,142
Well, I figure we'll have to pay some lives,
but I'm no spendthrift.

277
00:22:03,122 --> 00:22:06,614
AII that stuff that you were spouting
about regulations and all that stuff,

278
00:22:06,692 --> 00:22:08,489
is that really in the book?

279
00:22:09,361 --> 00:22:12,819
Frankly, I don't know.
I figure the Lieutenant will look it up.

280
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:16,265
Not too soon, he won't. 'Cause while you
were indoctrinating the troops,

281
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,633
-I snatched this out of his duffle bag.
-Hey.

282
00:22:19,939 --> 00:22:22,931
Well, what do you know.
Francis, I appreciate that.

283
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,635
Nothing at all, Captain.

284
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:28,009
Very interesting.
Haven't read it since I was a kid.

285
00:22:28,614 --> 00:22:31,515
If you had,
you'd have been a colonel by now.

286
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:43,426
This is mighty peculiar scouting, skipper.

287
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:47,226
Now you just watch. They'll come to us.

288
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:49,460
You can see that light from any hilltop.

289
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,531
Yeah, but that sure is dirty pool.

290
00:22:55,274 --> 00:22:57,834
FUJIMOTO: Sergeant, it's unwise
to disobey our commander.

291
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:00,674
TAMURA: Commander!
He is too tame for this job.

292
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:03,475
HIRANO: They say he was
the top of his class at officer's school.

293
00:23:03,549 --> 00:23:06,109
TAMURA: Shut up!
Theory and practice is different.

294
00:23:06,185 --> 00:23:08,710
FUJIMOTO: But we are ordered to
report to him as soon as we rendezvous.

295
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:11,347
Stop arguing!
We can't depend on such a commander.

296
00:23:11,423 --> 00:23:12,412
(SHUSHING)

297
00:23:12,992 --> 00:23:17,452
Quiet. We are getting close. Follow me.

298
00:23:37,182 --> 00:23:38,945
Wait till the whole detail's in the open.

00:24:28,334 --> 00:24:30,461
(FIRING CONTINUES)

305
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,909
I'm taking no more orders to sit here
on my lard!

306
00:24:38,877 --> 00:24:42,313
Remember Article 9, Lieutenant, Page...
What page did he say?

307
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:44,315
I don't know what the hell happened
to that damn handbook.

308
00:24:44,383 --> 00:24:45,441
I lost it somewhere.

309
00:24:45,517 --> 00:24:48,509
But I'll take my chances he's faking.
Come on.

310
00:25:03,035 --> 00:25:04,024
BOURKE: I smell a grenade.

311
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:21,717
TAMURA: Those Yankees,
slippery as snakes.

312
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:35,129
KUROKI? Of the two men in me,
only the hard-nosed soldier

313
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,260
can be understood by Sergeant Tamura,

314
00:25:38,337 --> 00:25:43,400
defying my order, risking lives
on some crazy night adventure.

315
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:50,147
To him, patience is weakness
and a rational man is a fool.

316
00:25:52,918 --> 00:25:56,581
I was trained for combat, sir,
and no flight officer's got a license

317
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:57,781
to keep me out of action!

318
00:25:58,123 --> 00:25:59,920
I may sound impertinent, sir,

319
00:25:59,992 --> 00:26:02,859
but I have more combat experience
than you have.

320
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,785
Diddly-squat!

321
00:26:04,863 --> 00:26:07,696
What the hell would a pilot know
about infantry tactics?

322
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:11,661
What's wrong with my trying to
destroy the enemy?

323
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:13,902
Corporal Craddock,
you're a witness to armed defiance...

324
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,872
-Armed defiance!
-Yes, sir, they're sure armed.

325
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:17,168
Why, that's crazy! We only came here to...

326
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:19,301
Now you take your gravel crunchers
back up that hill

327
00:26:19,378 --> 00:26:22,939
-and be thankful I'm a lenient man!
-Yes, sir.

328
00:26:23,215 --> 00:26:26,946
And I would do likewise again, sir,
at any sacrifice.

329
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:28,008
(GRUNTS)

330
00:26:31,824 --> 00:26:33,724
You fool!

331
00:26:33,792 --> 00:26:37,922
I had planned to attack them tonight,
but your disobedience ruined the plan.

332
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:41,363
Next time I will
have your head chopped off.

333
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,422
Yes, sir.

334
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:56,114
Who the hell you working for,
us or the Japs?

335
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:07,421
How Long you been cutting hair?

336
00:27:07,493 --> 00:27:09,256
You're my first customer, jughead.

337
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:23,430
I wonder where our big military brain
from the wild blue yonder is.

338
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:26,607
Probably out studying geography.

339
00:27:26,678 --> 00:27:29,772
Yeah? I hope to hell he knows
what he's doing on the ground.

340
00:27:29,848 --> 00:27:33,750
He does, pal. Didn't he tell you
he used to be a ground pounder?

341
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:35,475
(EXCLAIMING IN SURPRISE)

342
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:38,749
Yeah, so he didn't Like fighting
and took to the air.

343
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:41,520
Me? I don't recognize no C.O.,
except Lieutenant Blair, here.

344
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:44,619
Mouth-fighters.

345
00:27:46,098 --> 00:27:50,296
-What do you want us to be, scared?
-Yeah. Better you should be, boot.

346
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:53,827
They transferred me to this nursery
to learn you that.

347
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,308
Say, I hear you killed your share at Guadal.

348
00:27:58,377 --> 00:28:04,179
Yeah. And I was scared all the time.
That's why I'm still here, kiddies.

349
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:08,980
-Halt! Who goes there?
-CRADDOCK: Daniel Boone.

350
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:15,383
Lieutenant, the captain was right, sir.

351
00:28:15,727 --> 00:28:17,786
We'd have been real dead
trying to get at that camp.

352
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,387
How big is their outfit, Craddock?

353
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:22,797
Well, I can't say for sure, sir.
I was too busy ducking their outposts.

354
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:25,166
But they got a smart location
with a supply wharf

355
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,637
that don't look
Like it's been used much lately.

356
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:30,072
You have to swim to get at 'em
on the bay side

357
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,667
and they got a big old lookout hill
over on the east.

358
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:35,304
Brambles at the other approaches
are worse than poison ivy.

359
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:36,369
Ah.

360
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:38,040
There's something else
mighty interesting, sir.

361
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,641
-What's that?
-They're building a boat.

362
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:48,552
Well, that is interesting.
Maybe they're building it for us.

363
00:28:49,127 --> 00:28:50,219
MALONEY: Yeah.

364
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:53,490
They can keep it.
The kind of boat I'm looking for

365
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:57,831
is one of those gray buckets
with a big fat stars and stripes on it.

366
00:29:01,873 --> 00:29:06,037
Now listen. Our lookout has just reported
that he had seen an enemy ship.

367
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:10,174
We will go into the emergency
operation immediately. Ando?

368
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,114
-Yes, sir?
-You know your orders.

369
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:15,051
-I do, sir.
-Carry on.

370
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,324
Right face!

371
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:29,155
Well, I ain't been drinking.
It must be your power of suggestion.

372
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:32,761
No, sir, my boy,
that's genuine American Navy.

373
00:29:33,005 --> 00:29:34,029
(EXCLAIMING IN DELIGHT)

374
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,733
Looks mighty good to me, Corpsman.

375
00:29:35,807 --> 00:29:36,831
(LAUGHING)

376
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:38,102
BLAIR: Take a look at that, that's a ship.

377
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,234
What the hell are you doing about it?

378
00:29:39,311 --> 00:29:40,869
Well, we just now identified her as U.S.

379
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,506
-We got to try and signal that ship. Keller.
-Yes, sir.

380
00:29:43,582 --> 00:29:45,550
-Improvise some smoke pots.
-Right away, sir.

381
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,244
She's searching for us
because we're overdue.

382
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,082
Searching the water
because I plowed in that airplane

383
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:50,485
clean out of sight of the ocean.

384
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:52,079
Now, Lieutenant, you pick some men
and come with me.

385
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:53,556
-Yes, sir. Ruffino, Dexter...
-Bleeker, you stay here

386
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,490
and guard the camp
with the rest of the men.

387
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,118
BLAIR: Right. Move out.

388
00:30:14,446 --> 00:30:17,847
BOURKE: Hold it. AII right,
spread out and move slow.

389
00:30:33,265 --> 00:30:35,199
Don't let them get off a signal to the ship.

390
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:46,371
Shoot anyone who pops out of the jungle.

391
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,583
Get in there and light those pots
on the double.

392
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:05,260
(GUN FIRING)

393
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:15,437
-BLAIR: You see anything, Captain?
-No.

394
00:31:15,507 --> 00:31:18,635
MARINE 1: Is it a sniper?
MARINE 2: Must be, I don't see anybody.

395
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,878
Yeah, you learned young, Marine.

396
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:30,781
Now let's go.

397
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:40,992
Now let them come out. Let's go.

398
00:32:06,992 --> 00:32:09,654
Wait a minute. They got to have
something more than that going for 'em.

399
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:11,889
They could have pinned us down
on this beach for a week.

400
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:13,658
(PLANE ENGINE ROARING)

401
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:14,721
Hit the deck!

402
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:35,877
You stupid bums,
you're firing at your friends!

403
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,319
Lieutenant, over here!

404
00:32:37,389 --> 00:32:39,755
They can't see the color of your eyes,
but they can see that.

405
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:13,680
Well, I guess we've had it.

406
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,090
They don't even think
this island's worth much shooting at.

407
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:21,188
-I guess we'll be here forever.
-It'll seem longer than that.

408
00:33:25,103 --> 00:33:26,627
(WHISTLING CHEERFULLY)

409
00:33:26,705 --> 00:33:30,801
KUROKI? So now it appears that we
and our enemy are about even

410
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:32,571
in men and weapons.

411
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:37,877
And bad luck. They, too, are marooned
with no means of communication.

412
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:40,679
It was plain they couldn't radio their ship.

413
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:46,387
To adjust to our stone-age standard
of living will not be easy for them.

414
00:33:46,758 --> 00:33:51,718
Evidently they have no provider
like my good simple-minded Okuda.

415
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,766
I been waiting for you, Mac.
You're sure a slowpoke.

416
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:01,266
I want you to answer me
a few questions, boy.

417
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:05,207
First off, how many men you got
scattered around this island?

418
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:10,876
Come on, boy, you're being interrogated.
Can't you talk a little English?

419
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:20,523
You listen to me.

420
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:23,755
If you're just giving me a dumb act,
I'm gonna ream your belly button.

421
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:33,396
Oh, shucks. I never could stick a guy
when he was smiling at me.

422
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:36,465
Fact is,

423
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:41,171
where I come from we don't shoot nobody
who's got a knack for catfish or sour mash.

424
00:34:44,049 --> 00:34:46,449
How you Like 'em cigarettes, Tojo?

425
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:54,122
The fish?

426
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:09,034
Good hot wampum from PX.

427
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:14,771
See you again, boy,
and we'll talk some more.

428
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:16,370
Hey, this is good.

429
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:18,141
Yeah, baby.

430
00:35:23,088 --> 00:35:25,784
KUROKI? How strange are these barbarians.

431
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:29,156
Ferocious yet capable of human reasoning.

432
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:34,088
"And we don 't shoot nobody
who's got a knack for fish. "

433
00:35:34,165 --> 00:35:38,534
So this afternoon
I undertake an intelligence mission.

434
00:35:56,855 --> 00:36:00,256
Finally I discover
what I am really looking for.

435
00:36:00,325 --> 00:36:04,125
Their commander.
My colleague in the game of death.

436
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:09,064
Oh, yes, I know him at once
by his lonely detachment from the others.

437
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:15,469
Captain, I think it's my duty to tell you

438
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,974
these men are fed up
with your kind of war!

439
00:36:18,043 --> 00:36:19,738
I didn't choose this kind.

440
00:36:19,811 --> 00:36:21,608
-You claim you're in command!
-I'm in command!

441
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,045
Then attack!

442
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:26,539
Sir.

443
00:36:28,687 --> 00:36:32,316
Lieutenant, a frontal attack on their terms
would sure accommodate 'em.

444
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:36,156
Yes, indeedy.
Begging the Lieutenant's pardon, sir.

445
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:38,991
If we hit that camp
they'd chop us up into dog meat.

446
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,397
-Corporal Ruffino.
-Yes, sir?

447
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,366
What is your opinion on that matter?

448
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:46,362
Well, sir, I'd say they're too smart
to attack our hill position,

449
00:36:46,438 --> 00:36:49,032
so I guess it's guerrilla tactics all the way.

450
00:36:51,076 --> 00:36:53,135
They've got the advantage there, too.
Food and water.

451
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:56,669
We're on short rations with very little
to wash 'em down with but coconut milk.

452
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:58,340
Well, I spotted their water supply.

453
00:36:58,416 --> 00:37:00,646
It's a spring well over to the west.

454
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,619
But they sure got it secured.

455
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:04,518
My men could take it, they're Marines!

456
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:07,854
No, they're not Marines
till they start growing some brains!

457
00:37:07,926 --> 00:37:09,587
You tell 'em, Captain.

458
00:37:09,661 --> 00:37:11,754
He was in boot camp
before they invented the airplane.

459
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:17,261
Well, who am I to contradict an old salt
who was with Decatur at Tripoli?

460
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:19,934
Has-beens.

461
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:21,928
Has-beens!

462
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:26,439
What was it he said about jungle law?
Well, we finally got it, ain't we?

463
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,307
Now, you guys
take your orders from the Lieutenant.

464
00:37:32,383 --> 00:37:33,873
I'll handle the fly-boy.

465
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:36,386
You dumb slob!
You're lucky you don't work for a Jap C.O.,

466
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:37,546
he'd put you in that grave!

467
00:37:37,622 --> 00:37:41,183
I'd make sukiyaki out of him.
And that goes for you, too.

468
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:55,968
Anybody else?
Last call for gripers, and I mean Last!

469
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,402
Captain,

470
00:38:00,745 --> 00:38:03,407
I consider it my duty to apologize, sir,

471
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,506
and request a deck court for that man.

472
00:38:05,583 --> 00:38:07,483
Forget it, Lieutenant.

473
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:10,146
We're gonna need every big baboon
we can housebreak.

474
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:12,849
Now let's see if we can't work together

475
00:38:12,924 --> 00:38:15,518
and figure out a way
to get off this worthless scab on the ocean.

476
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:22,231
KUROKI? I could easily kill him now
at the cost of my own life.

477
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:26,331
I have been taught that death is purity,

478
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:31,171
and sometimes the call to die
is a stronger wine than life.

479
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:33,637
He still lives today

480
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:37,841
because in the loneliness of command,
we are brothers.

481
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,928
TAMURA: That's all today.

482
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:25,117
Damn!

483
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,896
Must've made that one at Lockheed.

484
00:39:28,967 --> 00:39:32,630
Yeah, well, I tell you, I take 'em as
a good sign we're getting close to water.

485
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:35,502
Now we'll wait here for Craddock,
then we'll go on to the spring.

486
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:38,737
Hey, Hoxie,

487
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,175
I'll make book with you on who drinks first.

488
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:41,837
AII right, slicker, you're on.

489
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,074
Double what I owe you or nothing
that I beat you to the water.

490
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:45,137
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

491
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:53,155
AII right, we'll advance, but slow.

492
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,318
Wish to hell I'd brought more canteens.

493
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,745
HOXIE: Oh, man, it's a beauty!

494
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:23,220
Yeah, this is as close as we'll get.

495
00:40:23,288 --> 00:40:24,653
What? Sir.

496
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:26,246
I plan to grab the Japanese boat.

497
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:28,724
Our action here is just a feint
to draw them away from it.

498
00:40:28,793 --> 00:40:30,920
But, sir, we gotta have some water!
We were ready...

499
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,486
That spring will be there anytime,
the boat won't.

500
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,863
Figure they built it to contact
their main force, it's our best bet, too.

501
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:38,527
Watch the action, gents.

502
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,230
No, you idiot!

503
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:55,852
-It don't make sense, skipper.
-Yes, it does.

504
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:02,218
Come on, you guys.
The Searcy luck's protecting you. Come on.

505
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:05,894
No! Damn it, come back here!

506
00:41:26,284 --> 00:41:27,546
I'm sorry I jumped the command, sir.

507
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:29,984
Get back to Maloney.
You're no good to me.

508
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:31,453
Yes, sir.

509
00:41:33,591 --> 00:41:35,684
-Craddock!
-Yes, sir.

510
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,923
I want you to make Like a platoon.
Spread 'em thin and encircle Indian style.

511
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,760
Make the enemy C.O. think
there's so many of you

512
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:41,856
He'll send reinforcements.

513
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:44,197
When you get the merry-go-round going,
leave Roth in charge.

514
00:41:44,268 --> 00:41:46,793
You and Bleeker join me
at Rendezvous Tidewater.

515
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:48,133
Yes, sir.

516
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:53,501
Fujimoto.

517
00:41:54,045 --> 00:41:55,808
You will re-enforce the spring immediately.

518
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:56,869
Yes, sir.

519
00:41:56,948 --> 00:41:59,075
But return at once if you hear firing
from this quarter.

520
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:00,310
FUJIMOTO: Yes, sir.

521
00:42:00,385 --> 00:42:04,617
I suspect a decoy maneuver
to get at our camp.

522
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:10,594
Commander, will the boat be all right?
She is Like a wife to me, sir.

523
00:42:10,661 --> 00:42:13,630
Don't worry.
We will defend your wife's honor.

524
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:14,687
Yes, sir.

525
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:19,266
Corporal Fujimoto will take three men
to re-enforce the spring, sir.

526
00:42:20,872 --> 00:42:24,569
Left face, forward on the double.

527
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:21,951
-Don't waste ammunition.
-I saw something moving there.

528
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:24,627
You are impossible.

529
00:44:25,263 --> 00:44:28,664
No Yankee boat thieves can be here
until the full tide covers the reef.

530
00:44:28,733 --> 00:44:30,132
But I am only telling you what I saw.

531
00:44:30,201 --> 00:44:32,135
You fool! Don't be a chicken!

532
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:37,107
You are the worst soldier
in the whole Imperial Army.

533
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:40,042
I believe I share the distinction, Sergeant.

534
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:43,236
I try to make allowances
for a prayer reader.

535
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:47,512
If anything happens to me,
read me a prayer, will you?

536
00:44:47,585 --> 00:44:49,610
Oh, leave it up to me, Sergeant.

HOXIE: Operation Idiot.

541
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:12,700
Ain't nothing holding that boat
but two little old pieces of rope.

542
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:14,472
They can cast her off on the run.

543
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:17,013
Fine. Now get this.

544
00:45:18,082 --> 00:45:21,142
We can't float her over the reef
before the dawn tide.

545
00:45:21,219 --> 00:45:24,120
When the moon goes down,
you’ll wade out and board her.

546
00:45:24,188 --> 00:45:25,348
Keep your powder high and dry.

547
00:45:25,423 --> 00:45:28,586
And remember,
your destination is Santa Isabel.

548

-You got the chart?
-Yes, sir.

549
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,261
-Any questions?
-No, sir.

550
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,359

-The fore cable has been cut.

The cable's been cut off.
Take the boat on the other side of the pier.

Out of his rib, as the story goes.
Ando and his boat.

He loved her like a wife and died with her.

And here lies Arikawa,
who so boldly charged the boat.

And here is the Marine
who traded his life for a drink of water.

00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:36,806
Take heed, you fornicators!

611
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,205
And bridle your lust
for your neighbor's geisha.

612
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:44,643
'Tis the item of the boat I'm speaking of,
my stupid friends.

613
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:47,847
She was a lover to the Japanese.

614
00:54:48,852 --> 00:54:51,218
Men are strongest
when they're protecting their darlings.

615
00:54:52,055 --> 00:54:55,286
Look, what we don't need here
is a drunken Irish poet.

616
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:57,122
I ordered you to lay off the whiskey.

617
00:55:00,230 --> 00:55:01,788
Okay, Captain Bourke.

618
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:07,661
I'm sober enough to say I'm sorry,
and I'm sorry for you, too.

619
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:10,502
So you bums didn't Like my heads enough
to stick around.

You won't find no better in hell.

621
00:55:14,478 --> 00:55:17,174
If they could hear me,
I'd promise each of them a dead Jap.

KUROKI: Captain!

623
00:55:22,286 --> 00:55:25,119
I wish to speak to the American captain.

624
00:55:25,189 --> 00:55:26,554
Can you hear me?

625
00:55:27,925 --> 00:55:30,223
I hear you! Who are you?

626
00:55:30,294 --> 00:55:34,890
Lieutenant Kuroki.
I wish to negotiate with you. Privately.

627
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:38,067
-I'll take care of the creep.
-Now you stay put, shavetail.

628
00:55:42,039 --> 00:55:44,974
-You alone?
-KUROKI: Yes. Of course.

629
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:48,736
-Where?
-KUROKI: 50 meters east will do.

630
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,942
Now you try barging in, Lieutenant,
and I'll kill you.

631
00:55:58,755 --> 00:56:01,087
Damn maniac would, too.

632
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:13,867
Very trusting of you to come unarmed.

633
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,194
My apologies.

634
00:56:18,609 --> 00:56:20,133
You the commanding officer?

635
00:56:20,777 --> 00:56:22,642
Only the Acting C.O.

636
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:26,046
as a result of casualties
in our battalion command.

637
00:56:26,650 --> 00:56:27,639
Battalion?

638
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,948
You must have them well dispersed.

639
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:36,152
You'd need air reconnaissance
to spot all the units.

640
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,955
Yeah, well, I'm fresh out of airplanes.

641
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:40,261
And we are both

642
00:56:41,365 --> 00:56:43,458
out of communicational equipment.

643
00:56:44,968 --> 00:56:46,128
Well, no matter.

644
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:50,496
My transport was carrying
double troop capacity.

00:56:53,777 --> 00:56:55,608
Most of them deployed in the hills.

647
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:58,538
So many and so thirsty, eh?

648
00:57:00,851 --> 00:57:02,341
I wouldn't snow you on that.

649
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:05,415
A little honesty is refreshing.

650
00:57:06,723 --> 00:57:07,712
Yeah.

651
00:57:09,226 --> 00:57:11,524
Pardon me for testing yours.

652
00:57:11,595 --> 00:57:16,498
It's perfectly all right. I was afraid
it was making you uncomfortable in there.

653
00:57:18,068 --> 00:57:20,969
What else is bugging you, Lieutenant?
Why'd you call me out here?

654
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:28,506
I need the services of your doctor
for a soldier with a gangrenous leg.

655
00:57:29,313 --> 00:57:32,578
In return you may fill your canteens
at the spring.

656
00:57:34,685 --> 00:57:35,845
Now that's not much of a fee

657
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:38,547
for a man who's spent half his life
in medical college.

658
00:57:40,424 --> 00:57:43,450
I will add 20 liters of potatoes.

659
00:57:45,395 --> 00:57:48,387
-And fish?
-Ten kilos of dried fish.

660

AII right, it's a deal.

661
00:57:53,337 --> 00:57:57,740
I'll deliver my medic to you at the spring
in about, say, one hour from now?

662
00:57:59,977 --> 00:58:01,137
Right.

for water and food.

666

But in Singapore I got real dough.

667
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:23,989
Yeah, but, they can't deport you here
for practicing without a diploma.

668
00:58:24,067 --> 00:58:25,728
Oh, you got a big mouth.

669
00:58:25,802 --> 00:58:27,497
And They'll probably also stick
a bayonet in my gut

670
00:58:27,571 --> 00:58:29,061
if the patient comes up kaput.

671
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:30,299
Now don't be crass.

672
00:58:30,374 --> 00:58:33,343
I gave him the impression
you're a highly educated M.D.

673
00:58:33,410 --> 00:58:35,139
Oh, you're so good to me, Captain.

674
00:58:35,212 --> 00:58:38,272
I'm also promoting you
to my Chief of Intelligence.

I expect you to scout their camp,

676
00:58:39,649 --> 00:58:41,844
give me a report
on the materials and manpower.

677
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,584
Now you're giving me a chance
to get shot as a spy.

678
00:58:45,922 --> 00:58:47,753
Well, nothing's too good for my boy.

That's what I mean.
Chokes me up right there. Oh, you...

in front of the barracks,

on sand in this box.

to know our real strength here.

is almost draining the well.

Did you find out the enemy strength?
I ordered you to count the canteens.

Yes, sir, I counted, but...

-He fooled me.
-Fooled you?

695
00:59:42,212 --> 00:59:46,444
He brought only one canteen.
It's the world's biggest.

A fuel tank from the plane.

I can't do business with Yankee traders.

698

Maybe he has a lot more soldiers
than we estimated.

699
00:59:59,696 --> 01:00:02,164
So do we here. Look.

Everybody out of the barracks!
We have a visitor.

No, no. Let them rest.

922
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:48,375
Good night, Lieutenant.

923
01:24:48,450 --> 01:24:49,576
Good night, Captain.

924
01:24:49,651 --> 01:24:53,018
Kompai. "Thou shalt not kill."

925

Dennis Bourke has lost a second lover.

926
01:25:00,629 --> 01:25:04,065
One of these days
I'm gonna button your lip for keeps!

927
01:25:11,907 --> 01:25:15,308
What was it you said? Second lover?

928
01:25:15,377 --> 01:25:17,038
Mmm-hmm.

929
01:25:17,846 --> 01:25:20,679
Love ain't always for people, Lieutenant.

930
01:25:22,050 --> 01:25:25,577
Often it's an idea
that keeps pounding at you.

931
01:25:26,355 --> 01:25:27,720
What kind of idea?

932
01:25:27,789 --> 01:25:30,155
Oh, many kinds of ideas.

933
01:25:30,225 --> 01:25:33,991
Do good, do bad,
rob a bank, build a hospital.

934
01:25:34,563 --> 01:25:37,327
Or maybe a real big idea

935
01:25:37,399 --> 01:25:40,061
Like peace on Earth, goodwill toward men.

936
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:44,369
Or maybe an idea that keeps
driving old Dennis.

937
01:25:45,807 --> 01:25:49,766
Win the war.
Smash everything that comes in your way.

938
01:25:51,380 --> 01:25:53,473
Someone did get in his way?

939
01:25:55,250 --> 01:25:57,810
You hit him where he lives.

940
01:25:57,886 --> 01:26:00,252
You gave your girl a fair shake.

941
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:03,514
-Kompai.
-Aw, no more kompai.

942
01:26:04,426 --> 01:26:06,724
Until you've told me about him.

943
01:26:08,430 --> 01:26:10,091
Yeah, where was I?

944
01:26:11,767 --> 01:26:13,325
About his girl.

945
01:26:14,803 --> 01:26:17,601
Well, just before the beginning of the war,

946
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:21,640
he got busted up pretty badly.
Airplane crash.

947
01:26:23,412 --> 01:26:24,640
And she wangled a government job

948
01:26:24,713 --> 01:26:27,841
and got herself to the Philippines
to be near him.

949
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:32,045
Imagine coming all the way from the
United States to help this bum get well.

950
01:26:32,120 --> 01:26:33,519
(CHUCKLING)

951
01:26:34,256 --> 01:26:36,747
And she was some kind of girl, pal.

952
01:26:36,892 --> 01:26:38,723
Some kind of a doll.

953
01:26:40,395 --> 01:26:41,987
Once she kissed me

954
01:26:42,064 --> 01:26:46,501
'cause she found out I got him
to the hospital in time to save his life.

955
01:26:46,802 --> 01:26:47,894
Yeah.

956
01:26:49,171 --> 01:26:50,832
She kissed me right there.

957
01:26:52,040 --> 01:26:54,474
Soft as the wings of a butterfly.

958
01:26:56,778 --> 01:26:59,747
I wasn't the kind of guy who went around
kissing ladies, but,

959
01:26:59,815 --> 01:27:03,046
that little goober stuck there
just Like it was a tattoo.

960
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:06,183
I guess I was kind of mushy about her.

961
01:27:06,254 --> 01:27:08,279
Imagine a tramp Like me.

962
01:27:09,391 --> 01:27:12,121
Maybe that's why I dig at him so much.

963
01:27:12,360 --> 01:27:13,827
Anyway, when he got out of sickbay

964
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:16,887
the flight surgeons
kept him grounded for a while.

965
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:21,033
And finally, just before the fall of Manila,

966
01:27:21,770 --> 01:27:24,796
some of them were already
dancing on the lid of the coffin.

967
01:27:28,477 --> 01:27:32,038
Well, he got his flying papers back
because we were short-handed in the air,

968
01:27:32,114 --> 01:27:35,914
but he kept the secret from her
that he was shoving off the next day.

969
01:27:35,984 --> 01:27:38,316
He briefed me
on what he had to do that night.

970
01:27:38,386 --> 01:27:42,220
Break the news that I was gonna put her
on the next flight stateside.

971
01:27:42,290 --> 01:27:43,848
She didn't fight it much.

972
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:47,088
She knew as well as any of us
that nobody but Dennis ever wins.

973
01:27:47,195 --> 01:27:49,857
All she asked was that they be married,

974
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:53,799
figuring it would give her an excuse
to go on living, even if he was killed.

975
01:27:54,169 --> 01:27:56,797
But he claims he thought
it wouldn't be fair to her,

976
01:27:56,872 --> 01:28:00,103
married to nothing
but the memory of a selfish slob.

977
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:02,267
But I know his breed.

Oh, no. Lorie? Lorie!

01:28:40,048 --> 01:28:42,414
Lorie. Lorie.

983
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:49,989
Don't take no headshrinker to figure out
that he wishes he was dead instead of her.

984
01:28:50,058 --> 01:28:51,423
Conscience.

985
01:28:52,127 --> 01:28:55,654
Exactly. That's the monkey on his back,

986
01:28:55,730 --> 01:28:58,722
eating away at him Like cancer, only worse.

987
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,133
Too slow, too mean to make an end of it.

988
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:06,435
Teaching him the hard way
that Lorie was his only real love.

989
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:09,875
And you are his self-appointed conscience.

990
01:29:09,945 --> 01:29:11,936
She was real to me, too.

that the bomb was his mistress!

Don't! Just play it cool, Lieutenant.

they doubled back that way.

01:37:19,567 --> 01:37:23,162
Until my country advises otherwise,
I remain at war.

1078
01:37:27,975 --> 01:37:31,069
I am sure you understand, Captain.

1079
01:37:33,147 --> 01:37:34,614
I understand.

1080
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:44,753
Goodbye, my friend.

1081
01:37:59,941 --> 01:38:03,240
(SPEAKING JAPANESE)
Left face! Forward march!

1082
01:38:16,624 --> 01:38:17,818
MALONEY: Hirano!

1083
01:38:23,598 --> 01:38:24,963
Stay here.

1084
01:38:40,281 --> 01:38:41,475
Hirano!

1085
01:38:54,162 --> 01:38:58,326
MAN ON RADIO? U.S.S. Walker
to Captain Bourke. Captain Bourke. Over.

1086
01:39:00,635 --> 01:39:02,967
Captain Bourke. Aboard Walker. Over.

1087
01:39:03,037 --> 01:39:06,996
MAN ON RADIO? Verifying previous plan.
Our rendezvous is at north point. Over.

1088
01:39:08,242 --> 01:39:09,766
Roger. We're on our way. Over.

1089
01:39:09,844 --> 01:39:11,243
MAN ON RADIO? We carry no orders
for mop-up,

1090
01:39:11,312 --> 01:39:14,440
but will reinforce evacuation
if necessary. Over.

1091
01:39:14,515 --> 01:39:15,948
Not necessary. Over.

1092
01:39:16,017 --> 01:39:19,953
MAN ON RADIO? You have sufficient arms
to destroy remainder of enemy? Over.

1093
01:39:20,021 --> 01:39:21,989
Have and will do. Over and out.

1094
01:39:22,056 --> 01:39:23,080
-Waller!
-Yes, sir.

1095
01:39:23,157 --> 01:39:26,126
Get that grease gun up here
in front on the double.

1096
01:39:26,260 --> 01:39:29,696
You see any Japanese you start shooting
and shoot to kill.

1097
01:39:29,764 --> 01:39:31,959
I didn't save that kid's life
to see him get shot.

1098
01:39:32,033 --> 01:39:33,330
Why the hell don't we just get on the ship?

1099
01:39:33,401 --> 01:39:34,561
-Yeah. Why not?
-Let's get on the ship.

1100
01:39:34,635 --> 01:39:36,626
-Knock it off!
-Kuroki! If you're in there, keep away!

1101
01:39:36,704 --> 01:39:38,569
-Shut up, Lieutenant!
-Don't try it, do you hear me?

1102
01:39:38,639 --> 01:39:41,870
I said knock it off! Now move out!

1103
01:39:57,492 --> 01:39:59,858
-Look at that! Is that beautiful?
-Man, we're home!

1104
01:39:59,927 --> 01:40:01,554
(GUNS FIRING)

1105
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:23,074
Hold your fire.

1106
01:40:31,225 --> 01:40:32,658
(GUNS FIRING)

1107
01:40:47,008 --> 01:40:49,135
(SCREAMING)

1108
01:41:44,465 --> 01:41:46,262
Keiko.

1109
01:41:48,703 --> 01:41:50,170
Keiko.

1110
01:41:54,175 --> 01:41:55,802
Let me have a look at that.

1111
01:41:55,876 --> 01:41:57,673
Forget it. Take a look at Kuroki.

1112
01:41:57,745 --> 01:42:00,714
If you can do anything for him,
we'll take him along.

1113
01:42:03,517 --> 01:42:05,417
AII right, let's move.

1114
01:43:01,409 --> 01:43:02,899
BOURKE: Ruffino!
RUFFINO: Yes, sir?

1115
01:43:02,977 --> 01:43:05,241
-BOURKE: Bleeker!
-Yo.

1116
01:43:08,749 --> 01:43:11,547
Gather up our dead, we'll bury them at sea.

1117
01:43:11,619 --> 01:43:13,314
Yes, sir.

1118
01:43:30,037 --> 01:43:31,698
Well, he's had it.

1119
01:43:32,473 --> 01:43:34,998
Looks Like you won again, Danny boy.

1120
01:43:37,144 --> 01:43:39,271
He told me to give you this.

1121
01:43:45,252 --> 01:43:47,652
It's written in Japanese.

1122
01:43:47,722 --> 01:43:49,212
What do you make of it?

1123
01:43:49,290 --> 01:43:52,123
What little I can savvy,
it looks Like an address.

1124
01:43:52,259 --> 01:43:56,855
Aw, maybe one of these days I'll be
flying a crate of greenhorns into Japan.

1125
01:43:57,565 --> 01:44:00,056
I'll look into it.

1126
01:44:00,134 --> 01:44:05,834
Captain, his flag's still up there.
You want me to take it down?

1127
01:44:09,477 --> 01:44:11,069
It's his island.

1128
01:44:14,715 --> 01:44:17,548
KUROKI? Yes, and my friend the Captain

1129
01:44:17,618 --> 01:44:22,453
can tell you that my good soldiers
will always defend it.

1130
01:44:22,523 --> 01:44:25,458
For there is no death where the spirit lives.

1131
01:44:26,026 --> 01:44:30,395
So do not grieve, my dear Keiko,
when he brings you my journal.

1132
01:44:30,765 --> 01:44:34,861
This was only another day
and I say good night.

1133
01:45:29,857 --> 01:45:30,881
