1
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,920
It seems as if...

2
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,000
someone were pulling
a mower on the pavement...

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,000
Don't you remember?
It's the caterpillar of the light tank

4
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,920
We used to hear it often
during the manoeuvres.

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,000
There will be a war, Captain?

6
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,920
I know as much as you.

7
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
There was a telephone call from
the German side about an hour ago.

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,920
They asked to cancel this train.

9
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,920
It's an international train!

10
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,920
I can't do it.

11
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Tolek! Tolek!

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,920
Captain, do you know the connection with
the district has been cut.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,000
No telephone, no telegrams!

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,920
Are you sure?
Did you check it well?

15
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:23,920
Quite sure. Everything is
silent like death.

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
It was quite the same on last Tuesday,
when they cut all wires.

17
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
Lieutenant Rogalski with
fourteen men of reinforcement!

18
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,920
Are you crazy, Lieutenant?
Don't you know what is going on here?

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,920
Since a week gangs of saboteur
cut the communication

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
and shoot at
the customs officials...

21
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,920
A transformer has been blown up
yesterday night!

22
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
What the hell shall I do
with your fourteen men?

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,920
The Colonel says it is not wise
to provoke Germans

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,920
by keeping troops
along the frontier.

25
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,920
It is the decision of
the Head Quarters.

26
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,920
Form a line! Count off!

27
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
One, two, three,
four, five, six...

28
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
What the hell!
Who's missing?

29
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,920
Frank Dolas is missing.
Perhaps he took an outing

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:05,920
while we dropped in
for a glass of beer?

31
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Devil takes him! Are you sure
he didn't stay in the train?

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:09,920
Quite sure. We examined
the train before leaving

33
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,920
and he was travelling
in the same compartment.

34
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,920
Such a son...
I'll give him a lesson!

35
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Turn left!

36
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Detachment march!

37
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
- Isn't it as it were a holiday today?
- Because of the few passengers?

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
People are afraid
to travel near the frontier.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
There was no living soul
in the train from Poznan.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Did anybody come from the Office
with money for our salaries?

41
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,920
Is this the end
of the month already?

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
He, he, it is
September the 1 st

43
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,920
since 3 hours...

44
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
The devil! With all which is going on here
I lost the notion of time!

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,920
- Yet, you are sending this train?
- What can I do?

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,920
There is no connection
with the Management

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and I won't stick to
the orders of the Germans.

48
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The Twentieth Regiment of the Armoured
Division has reached the river bank.

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
It is all quiet on the Polish bank.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
The Seventieth Infantry Regiment with
full arms is ready for action!

51
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
The Third Armoured Division waiting
for order. Everything's ready, General!

52
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
The Station Master asked the Poles not
to stop the train. I was there, General.

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,920
Attention! Attention!

54
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,000
To all units of the Wehrmacht,
Navy and Airforces.

55
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I repeat... Start the execution of
the "Plan-Weiss" at 4.45 a.m.!

56
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Signed Adolf Hitler...

57
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Well, Gentlemen,

58
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
we are close to the most important
hour in our history.

59
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,920
All our forces will start the attack...

60
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
within three minutes.

61
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I wish you good luck.

62
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
The last three minutes,

63
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,000
during which Europe can quietly sleep...
- The whole world, General...

64
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Yes.

65
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Yes, Herr Obersturmfuehrer!

66
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,920
Yes, General?

67
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Do your soldiers
watch this train?

68
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,920
Maestro!

69
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,920
What station is this?

70
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I took a short nap...
...in the train and...

71
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
An irregular, as God
is dear to me, an irregular!

72
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Stop! Halt!

73
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Halt, or I fire!

74
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,920
My goodness,

75
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,000
what a mess!

76
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:02,000
HOW I UNLEASHED
THE SECOND WORLD WAR

77
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Part one:
ESCAPE

78
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Your march will be long,
but it is nothing

79
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The sun will dry your face
while you walk

80
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,000
And count your
last three bullets

81
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,000
And you know that
you won't miss the target

82
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,000
The roses are red
the lilac is white

83
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,000
No one complains
though the time is hard

84
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
We shall pass the hills
and drink cold water

85
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,000
For our field kitchen
vanished in fog

86
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Who would worry
that the road is full of dust

87
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Wet from rain or
white from snow

88
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:25,000
We shall pass the hills and
drink cold water

89
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Which after a battle has
the taste of wine

90
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
The roses are red,
the lilac is white

91
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,000
You'll come where you want,
though the time is hard

92
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Lance Corporal Franz Steinhauer reports at
the Watchtower number fourteen...

93
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Corporal Adolf Mueller reports at
the Watchtower number fifteen...

94
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
...so... he took the grass shears and
began to cut, cut and cut...

95
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,920
Regimental Sergeant Major on duty!

96
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,920
Everything is in order?

97
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:28,000
They sing, joke and dance,
like on holidays!

98
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
- Continue!
- Yes, Lieutenant!

99
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
That will be quite enough
for a civilian jacket.

100
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You will cut away the collar, make flaps
and you will make buttons of wood.

101
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
The supply of the current is flowing along
the poles behind the barbed wires.

102
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,920
It is possible to stop it...

103
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,000
but we must find a specialist
among our boys.

104
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,920
- Will add you two onions...
- Look, these are real ink pencils.

105
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,920
Taking three of them
you can paint your pants!

106
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Okay, I can give you three.
That's all I have got.

107
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,000
...a fox near the road
he has neither hand nor leg

108
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,000
have pity for the poor beast
give him a loaf of bread with butter

109
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Look, here's this high chimney with
a tin cock on the top. Have you got it?

110
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:08,920
Yes.

111
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:09,920
Okay. The way to
the Station turns left...

112
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,920
there are two... three...
seven telegraphic poles...

113
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:12,920
about three hundred fifty meters.

114
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,000
- Aren't you exaggerating?
- Shut up, and continue to work, old boy...

115
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,920
Without a map we shall be
lost in he night.

116
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:17,920
Are you crazy?

117
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,920
A tin of canned beef
is worthy thirty cigarettes

118
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,920
and you want to give me instead
a piece of dirty sausage?

119
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,920
But if they seize you with
Polish canned meat you'll be lost,

120
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,920
no matter what documents
you will have...

121
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,920
this is a German sausage,

122
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
genuine German sausage, smell it,
do you feel how it stinks?

123
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,920
The olderman of the camp must be previously
informed about every planned escape.

124
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,000
The problem of the documents
is entrusted to...

125
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,920
...perhaps to me? I've here a friend.
He is a very good draftsman...

126
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,920
Excellent!
Now the most difficult thing is...

127
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,000
- how to get civilian rigs. Perhaps...
- Gentlemen... gentlemen... attention!

128
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
...well, so he took the shears and
began to cut, cut and cut...

129
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,000
...and he went away?
- Well... yes... he went away...

130
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,920
The best trick I ever played in my life
was with that captain...

131
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,920
- What sort of trick?
- This man was boring like hell...

132
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,920
...a perfect nuisance... and
nothing could be done to change it.

133
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
Yet he had a hobby... he liked his garden
and he planted there a hedge...

134
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Once, we slipped in and stuck
there pieces of steel wire... and...

135
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,920
Who is this guy?

136
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,920
He is staying in the same hut with me. But
God knows who is he, where did he fight

137
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,920
and how did he get in this camp...
better be cautious against him...

138
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,000
and whenever you ask him a question,
he does not answer and he runs away...

139
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Go on... go on... make order
with this rubbish.

140
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,000
You are dawdling over
three hour here. Damn you!

141
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,920
Wait a minute!

142
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
Have you got matches?

143
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,920
- No. I don't smoke.
- Wait a moment.

144
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,000
There is a chance to get civvies.
You've to help us!

145
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:53,920
Eee...

146
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,920
Good gracious!

147
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,920
I hope you won't wait
till others win this war?

148
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Eee...

149
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,920
They are organizing in
France new units.

150
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:05,000
We'll get arms and
we'll be soldiers again...

151
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Eee... what for?

152
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Stop your eee, blockhead!

153
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:13,920
- It's your movement or mine?
- If you move...

154
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,920
It's a double...

155
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:19,000
If he moves to
the right corner, but why...

156
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:22,000
listen...
- if he played that way...

157
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:28,000
what will you do now...
- silence, plaese... just a minute...

158
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,000
Who is playing?
He is playing, or me?

159
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,000
One, two, three...

160
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,920
We must pour it
somewhere else.

161
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:45,000
Some guy is watching me...

162
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
Haili! Haili, haila,

163
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,920
a ha, ha, ha, ha.

164
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Okay! You can wind up!

165
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,920
Ja, ja,

166
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:50,920
Andrej!

167
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Good, good. I've heard it!

168
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
- Does it reach further?
- Yes, Yes...

169
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Is it enough?
I can, t any more.

170
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
You bloody fool! What the hell
are you doing?

171
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,000
Oh, God. Instead of helping you stick
your stupid head with silly things!

172
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,000
Go on! Take the pipes!
You idiot!

173
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,000
They don't take into account
that we make our overtime...

174
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:39,920
Ja, ja Andrej

175
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,000
because they don't stop scolding
and blaming us... Damned fools, once again!

176
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
They dawdle for three weeks
with this bathroom

177
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,000
instead of sending for
specialists to town.

178
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,920
Say, say frankly,

179
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,000
- isn't a work for you and me?
- Uhm...

180
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Alarm! The trap door!

181
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,000
The trap door is open!
The prisoner will escape! Alarm!

182
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:31,000
Three weeks will be enough...
this time...

183
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Get out... get out...

184
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,000
but if I catch you once more...
you'll go to the arrest...

185
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,000
Hurry up! Hurry up!

186
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,000
Let him through!

187
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,920
In the name of
all inmates of the camp

188
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,000
I congratulate you for
the exemplary attitude!

189
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,920
Attention!

190
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,920
Long live the lance
corporal Frank Dolas!

191
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,920
Long live the first soldier who
tried to escape!

192
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,920
- Hip, hip, hurray!
- Hurray!

193
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,920
- Hip, hip!
- Hurray!

194
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:23,000
- Hip, hip!
- Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!

195
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,000
There is no entrance to paradise
Without a pass

196
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,000
- Oh, oh, oh! You pierced me!
- It is a wire, my dear, hard, wasn't it?

197
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,000
But since there is no crowd

198
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Let us in Peter,
without a pass

199
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,000
It's a very unpleasant thing, but...

200
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,920
can you tell me...

201
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,000
who is the guy who refused

202
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:16,920
to help the fugitive?

203
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:20,000
Leave him in peace, boys.
I'll settle this matter myself.

204
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:23,000
Leave him in peace, boys.
Don't torment him any more...

205
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:26,000
Yes... yes...

206
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,000
Forgive me... I'm very sorry for
what happened there in the bath...

207
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,000
the two other soldiers
are sorry too...

208
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,000
I'll explain it to you later.

209
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,000
Damned bandits! What
does mean all that! What?

210
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,000
Pigs!

211
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Bloody gang of rascals!

212
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:58,000
Come on, come on...
I need you!

213
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,000
Something is wrong
in your plan...

214
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,920
I found a pole.

215
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:13,000
It's impossible to pass by
because of those bloody pipes!

216
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:16,000
- Where are you? - About seventeen
meters away from the wall.

217
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,920
Look. I've marked it here.

218
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:22,000
...and the old man threw out the gang
which tried to break into the heaven...

219
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:24,920
What is that! One cannot even enter
for a prayer!

220
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,000
Can't you read? Don't you see
what is written there up on the door?

221
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:31,920
Let's continue...

222
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,000
...and the old man
moved his moustache and

223
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,000
moved his beard,
but did not let them enter...

224
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,000
and the poor soldiers waited,
waited and waited...

225
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,000
...and I was sure it would not work,
but... oh... excuse me... wait a minute,

226
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,920
My goodness!

227
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:05,000
Oh, I've seen him,
this guy with a beard...

228
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,000
Will you stop your tricks, or not?
Let me see your hand!

229
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:16,000
It's him, Lieutenant.
I saw a stone in his hand!

230
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Show me your hand!

231
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,000
Impossible! He has swallowed
the stone!

232
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,920
- Are you all right?
- Not quite.

233
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,000
- Want some aspirin?
- No, thanks.

234
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,920
I have the great honour to inform you,
that you have been unanimously elected

235
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,920
as President of our Fellowship
Arbitrary Court. Do you accept?

236
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,000
- Yes, I do.
- Thank you.

237
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,000
Where is this...
this first fugitive?

238
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,000
He is there.
Lying in bed.

239
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,920
Lance Corporal Wachocki

240
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,920
of the Fourth Artillery Regiment
in Tomaszow.

241
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,920
Lance Corporal Woydyllo

242
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,920
of the Nineteenth Cavalry
Regiment in Nowogrodek.

243
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,920
Lance Corporal
Frank Dolas

244
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,920
from Warsaw. Volunteer.

245
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,000
- Better you speak first.
- Well...

246
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,920
We have organized a sort
of fugitives group.

247
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,000
Yes... but it was
Joseph's idea.

248
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,920
And we joined him.

249
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:33,920
Yes... he was arrested
shortly after.

250
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,920
...and we don't know
what shall we do now.

251
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:36,920
- How was he arrested?
- Quite simply.

252
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,920
You speak of the guy
with the beard?

253
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,000
Exactly. They took him straight
from the court yard, devil knows why.

254
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,920
And we already had dug seventeen
meters of underground passage...

255
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,920
The devil!

256
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,000
Right, dear comrade,
we quite agree with you.

257
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,000
- Shall we perhaps fill it up?
- Fill it up?

258
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,000
Look, I began to cut it
with my pen knife,

259
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,920
but I think it will take
a couple of weeks,

260
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,920
unless...

261
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
The war may finish
in a couple of weeks.

262
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:34,920
It will end without our aid.

263
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,000
St. Peter standing at the gate
reads a communique in the gazette...

264
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,920
- What?
- Shut up, for a minute, will you?

265
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,920
Suddenly someone knocked
at the golden gate

266
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:44,920
and St. Peter asked him...

267
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:45,920
...who is there?

268
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,000
Not allowed in the morning,
not allowed in the afternoon...

269
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,920
after all you must finish
at last...

270
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,000
You are quite right,
dear man,

271
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:54,920
we must finish at last...

272
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
and you will be able to pray then
as long as you want...

273
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Come in, come in, dear people,
I need you to prevent...

274
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:08,000
the Nazi to enter the paradise...

275
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,000
It's a pure loss of time
with this lousy knife...

276
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:44,000
...it's a rubbish, junk...

277
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:54,000
we must find something else...

278
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:00,000
And who was the guy
they took from the court yard?

279
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,000
- A blacksmith from Lodz. Mobilized...
- Joseph was our boss.

280
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,000
I am your boss now.

281
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,000
Hold it!

282
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,000
All sing... all sing...

283
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,000
...St. Peter standing at the gate
reads a communique in the gazette

284
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,000
- Suddenly someone knocks at the door...
- Open it!

285
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,000
...and St. Peter asks him:
Who is there... Soldiers...

286
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,920
My Lord...

287
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:45,920
don't you know

288
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:49,000
how to behave
in the heavens?

289
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:52,920
I will remove this pole and you must
continue to dig... you understand?

290
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Yes.

291
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,000
No wonder,

292
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,000
he is from Warsaw...

293
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,000
Achtung...

294
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:16,000
What?

295
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,000
Didn't you hear? Achtung!

296
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:37,000
Oh, I see you're organizing
a music hall here?

297
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,000
Excellent!

298
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,920
May we listen to?

299
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,920
Lieutenant would like to know
what are you singing?

300
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,920
Well... but first
you must release St. Peter...

301
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,920
Sure, we shall not sing
without Joseph.

302
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,000
- Lieutenant, they say that...
- I see...

303
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,920
that means
you won't sing?

304
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,000
No!

305
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,000
...and someone knocks at the gate...

306
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:31,000
Alarm! Alarm! Help! Help!
He tower is breaking!

307
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,000
...and when Peter fell asleep...
the soldier danced with the angels...

308
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:56,000
Help! Help! Help!
Hurry up! Hurry up! Aaa...

309
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:39,920
What?

310
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,920
Where are you taking us?

311
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:45,000
To a place from which
you won't run away!

312
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Here, this you'll ask to stamp,
and that you'll hand over

313
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:53,000
to the Station Commandant.

314
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:58,000
- We'll get along.
- Hurry up! Forward!

315
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:03,000
Try only to run away!

316
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:08,920
There's no camp from which
I wouldn't succeed.

317
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,000
Shut up!

318
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,000
Wacek! They are our men!

319
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:37,000
- Where to are they taking you?
- What are you looking for!

320
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,920
Go on! Quickly!

321
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,000
Halt! Halt!

322
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:16,000
Halt! Halt!

323
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,000
Why do you giggle, idiot?

324
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:32,920
We've neither documents
nor clothes.

325
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
They'll catch us before we have time
to stick our skulls into the window!

326
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,920
Why the devil did you shout: Go on?

327
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,000
Shut up!

328
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:42,920
Here, Regimental Sergeant Major...
they fled here.

329
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:46,000
I've shot at them twice! Twice!

330
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,000
Haven't you seen in which direction?

331
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,000
There must be somewhere there...
Perhaps there behind?

332
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,920
No! There behind is the engine-house.

333
00:37:56,000 --> 00:37:59,000
If they were there
we would have seen them!

334
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,920
Let's search the cars.
They can be in this train only!

335
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,000
Other compartments are locked.

336
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,000
No, no! Not there!
There is a bull!

337
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,000
It roars since noon...

338
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:36,000
In our village one bull
fled through the fence...

339
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:46,000
Look! A bull!
That's a real bull!

340
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,920
I would prefer to be killed
on the battlefield

341
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,920
than with the horns
of this stupid beast!

342
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,000
- Help! Help!
- Shut up!

343
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,920
We must stay here
till the next station.

344
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:00,000
I'm sure the cattle won't go far...

345
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,000
Oh, here's the engine driver!
Ask him!

346
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,000
Herr, Herr, come, come!

347
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,000
Is it far?

348
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,000
Strassberg? Oh, it's very far.
Perhaps seven hundred kilometres.

349
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
Maybe even more.
Eight hundred! Eight!

350
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:31,000
Eight hundred kilometres.

351
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,920
They won't see me,
any more.

352
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,920
You do what you want
but I go back.

353
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:40,000
I take my things and
cheerio!

354
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,920
Hey! Haven't you seen
two fugitives

355
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,000
in Polish uniform?

356
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:50,000
We nichts verstehen, Mr. Soldier.
We are Poles. Polen...

357
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,000
Oh, I see! Poles? Now
everything is clear! Hands up!

358
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,920
But, wait a moment, Mr. Soldier, we are from this
train... watching over the cattle, understand?

359
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:59,000
Shut up! That's you who helped them
to escape! Your documents!

360
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,920
We left our papers and
clothes in the train!

361
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:02,920
- The train is going!
- Halten sie! Halt!

362
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,000
We can't, Mr. Soldier,
the train is going!

363
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,000
I can't any more.
My hands got stiff.

364
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,000
Wait a minute.
I'll help you!

365
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Don't move. Let's pretend
we're dead.

366
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:25,000
You, fool, have you ever
seen a bull?

367
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,000
Mhm...

368
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,920
I'm not a peasant!

369
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:34,000
When I see a black beast
with horns it's a bull to me.

370
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Come on,

371
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,000
come on, blackie...

372
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:45,000
come on...

373
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:53,000
You can always rely on me.

374
00:40:55,000 --> 00:40:58,000
Documents,

375
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,000
rags...

376
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:05,000
I was born
under a lucky star, my dear.

377
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:05,920
Oh, God!

378
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:09,000
That's true. I was born
on Sunday, got it?

379
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:16,000
Andrzej Grzyb,
born in 1923...

380
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,000
in Zawada, near Wojciechow...
- Waclaw Janczak, born in Dabrowa...

381
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,000
I'm sure this Strassberg
is not far from France...

382
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,000
look, don't sleep...
- No. I don't.

383
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:30,920
What's your name?

384
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,920
Joseph.

385
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:35,000
And my name is Frank.

386
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,920
Are you angry with me?

387
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:38,920
- Why?
- You remember what happened in the camp?

388
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:42,000
Better learn by heart your new name.

389
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:45,920
You are a fine guy.

390
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,920
Frank...

391
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:50,000
Andrzej Grzyb,
born in 1923...

392
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,920
- Frank...
- Yes?

393
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,000
And if we succeed,
what you think

394
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,000
will they give us arms in France?
- They must!

395
00:41:58,000 --> 00:42:01,000
And where is
your rifle?

396
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,000
I wrapped it in rags
and I hid it in the ground.

397
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:09,000
And you?

398
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
Oh, I'll find some rifle,

399
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:18,000
even if I had to seek it
at the end of the world!

400
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,000
- Here are the stinking lazybones!
- The cattle starves and they do nothing!

401
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:42,000
Get up and quickly to work!

402
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,000
When the old Gulke will see you,
he'll drive mad! You damned fools!

403
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:01,000
- Strasburg! As God is dear to me!
- Strassberg, not Strasburg!

404
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:06,000
We are in Austria.

405
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,000
Will you stand so long?
Are you waiting for an invitation, eh?

406
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:17,000
You lazybones!

407
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,920
Oh, we had only
to bring this cattle here

408
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:32,920
and then go back to Poland.

409
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,000
Oh, it's written here, look...
Our job is fertig... over...

410
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:41,000
I don't care for your documents.
You have to work here, you lousy idlers!

411
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:46,000
Hurry up to your work or
I will talk with you in another way!

412
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,000
Good morning, Mr. Gulke,
do you need some help?

413
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:55,000
- Who are these guys?
- Workers from Poland.

414
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,920
They arrived with
this transport.

415
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:02,000
They don't look like workers.
Look at their hands.

416
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,920
You know, you are quite right.

417
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
They are too insolent. One of them
even tried to talk back.

418
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,000
I must watch him.

419
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
One has to have a slight idea about
geography before organizing an escape.

420
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,000
Strasburg is in France!

421
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
They are peasants.

422
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,000
Yes, you understand, Mr. Gulke,
I have red edges on the uniform

423
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:01,000
and such a beast won, t respect authority!

424
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,000
Joseph!
Joe!

425
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,000
Don't leave me alone!
I'm so lonely, so sad!

426
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,920
I made a mistake!
It's a human thing.

427
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:19,000
I'll be more careful from now on.
I promise you!

428
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,000
And that is a friend?

429
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:34,000
And you are
against me, too?

430
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:52,000
...gets three cows from Poland,

431
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:58,000
Frantz Winkler gets one cow from Poland,

432
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,000
Arthur Recknagel - two,

433
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,000
Liselotte Spek gets two cows

434
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:10,000
for her two sons in Wehrmacht...

435
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,000
Long live our Fuhrer
Adolf Hitler!

436
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,920
Today we get
Polish cattle,

437
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,000
tomorrow the French one and
after tomorrow that of the whole world!

438
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,920
Hurray!

439
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,000
Help! Help! A bull
from Poland! Help! Help!

440
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,920
Heil Hitler!

441
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,000
This man is suspected
of hostile intentions against the Reich.

442
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
His case is handed over to you.

443
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,000
You state you're a Pole and you came
here to work in the country.

444
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,000
Yes...

445
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:22,000
And your documents?

446
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:25,000
Herr Baron, the gentleman who owns
the bulls, has torn my documents.

447
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,920
Well, your name and
Christian name?

448
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:34,000
Grzegorz Brzechishchkiewicz...

449
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,000
Brzechishchkiewicz...

450
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Grzegorz...

451
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:56,000
Pshe... shchi... bzie...
shch... ps... ps... bzie...

452
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,000
- Brzeshchikiewicz...
- Shut up!

453
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,920
Hans!

454
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:12,920
Hans!

455
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:16,000
Type it at once!

456
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:31,000
- Name and Christian name?
- Grzegorz Brzeshchikiewicz...

457
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:35,920
What?

458
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:39,000
Witness Herbert Gulke.

459
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,000
Have you the documents relating
to this cattle transport from Poland?

460
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,000
Unfortunately not. All documents
have been destroyed by the bull...

461
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,000
Who could remember that. But I have
something which will surely interest you.

462
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:57,000
His personal belongings
which he left on the way.

463
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:10,000
What?

464
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:18,000
D... by... cy... wi... ch...

465
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:21,920
Born?

466
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:25,000
Chshonshchijevoshice.
District Lenkolovy...

467
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:42,000
From which camp
did you fade-out?

468
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Altdorf am See.
Stalag sieben acht.

469
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,000
- Your real name?
- Frantsishek Dolas.

470
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,000
You blockhead!

471
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,000
You wanted to cheat Gestapo?

472
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,920
Helmut!

473
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Take him away!

474
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:21,000
To the Commandant of the P.O. W camp
in Altdorf am See.

475
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:27,000
The Secret Police Office
in Oberbaumburg informs

476
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,000
that the prisoner
Frantsishek Dolas...

477
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:38,000
...was shot down
while he tried to escape.

478
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,000
Please cancel his name
on the list of camp prisoners.

479
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,920
Attention! Attention!

480
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,000
The passengers train
from Steinberg to Ludwigsfelde

481
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:05,000
moves from the platform one,
track two at 21 hours 30.

482
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:10,920
I repeat:

483
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,000
The passengers train
from Steinberg to Ludwigsfelde

484
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:18,000
moves from platform one,
track two at 21 hours 30!

485
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,000
Bandage it!

486
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:37,000
May I?

487
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:09,000
There is no paper.

488
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
And the door?

489
00:53:14,000 --> 00:53:17,000
What? Do you think
I'll shut it for you?

490
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,000
A Polish prisoner of war,
who fled from the camp.

491
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:27,000
Oh, they are all swines. I would put them
all to a concentration camp!

492
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,920
- I must... again...
- Can't you hold out?

493
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,920
It's not my fault...

494
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,920
I eat turnip, turnip and again turnip
since three months...

495
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,000
Oh, I can't hold
any more.

496
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
We won't leave this warm wagon
because of this lousy guy!

497
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:12,000
Enough?

498
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:18,000
Help! Help!

499
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:18,920
Come on, come on, all of you!

500
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,000
The bandit has locked
the door from inside!

501
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,920
Stop the train!

502
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,000
Pull the brakes!

503
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:00,000
Avalanche!

504
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:04,920
Who are you?

505
00:58:05,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Did you flee from the German army,
or you're lost the way in the mountains?

506
00:58:11,000 --> 00:58:14,000
Good gracious!
It is Yugoslavia!

507
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:16,000
A Polish prisoner of war
fled yesterday night from the train.

508
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:20,000
The trails lead to this region.

509
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
- We have got information...
- Your information is false,

510
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,000
Herr Obersturmfuehrer.

511
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:35,000
Herr Obersturmfuehrer, they
have broken the Pact one hour ago...

512
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:45,000
Herr Obersturmfuhrer! Da!

513
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:55,000
We suggest to hasten,

514
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:55,920
They want to close the frontier.

515
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,000
Fir the frontier will
be closed in five minutes.

516
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:39,000
Hurray! Hurray!

517
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,920
This is an original passport,
Lieutenant.

518
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:28,000
Don't worry about control.

519
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:28,920
Thank you, Colonel.

520
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,000
You must only remember
the new name. Please.

521
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,000
When you arrive to Split you must
find the ship "Attica" at once.

522
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,920
It sails off at seven.

523
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:45,000
You will hand these documents

524
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,000
to the Colonel in Cairo.
They are strictly confidental!

525
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,920
I'm sorry,

526
01:01:54,000 --> 01:01:57,000
but I'm not yet familiar with
those underground methods.

527
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:01,000
And will you assure the General
that I am going to keep the transfer unit

528
01:02:01,000 --> 01:02:01,920
up to the time of
the German invasion...

529
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:05,000
...then I'll join the underground
and await orders.

530
01:02:09,000 --> 01:02:12,000
Thank you.

531
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:15,920
I had even no opportunity
to know you better.

532
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:19,000
Service is service, Colonel.

533
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,000
Good bye, Miss Lieutenant.

534
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:34,000
- A demonstration?
- At three o'clock in the night?

535
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,000
Is that... eer, was that
the Polish Embassy?

536
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:39,920
- Good morning!
- Just a moment, gentleman,

537
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:40,920
it must be some mistake...

538
01:02:41,000 --> 01:02:44,000
A Pole... a Pole...

539
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:51,000
What is the matter, gentlemen?

540
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:55,000
Please, please, keep quiet...
please get out of here.

541
01:02:58,000 --> 01:02:59,920
What do they talk of?

542
01:03:00,000 --> 01:03:01,920
They speak about some hero.

543
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:05,000
Here you are.

544
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:15,000
This is for you.

545
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:19,000
Good bye.

546
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:22,000
Long live Poland!

547
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,000
That's too much!
A dead body in this situation?

548
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,000
- Good bye!
- Good. Okay. Good bye.

549
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,000
He probably died on the way.

550
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:46,000
Not of wounds anyway.

551
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,000
Of brandy. Plum brandy. Montenegrian
Slivovic, I recognized the smell.

552
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,920
Attention!

553
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:56,000
Attention!

554
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,920
I report that it's me
who unleashed this war, Colonel.

555
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:08,000
Unwillingly! Quite unwillingly!

556
01:04:26,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Is it far to Beograd,
Mademoiselle? Weiter?

557
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:32,000
Don't make a fool of yourself!

558
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:35,000
What are they going
to think of Poles?

559
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,000
Oh, all these slavish
languages are alike!

560
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:47,000
We haven't much time.

561
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,000
- We are arriVing.
- Where?

562
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:07,920
Let's stop here
for a moment.

563
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,920
I feel terribly thirsty. I would like
to drink something.

564
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:10,920
No, no... It's too dangerous.

565
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:14,000
It may start any moment!

566
01:05:14,000 --> 01:05:15,920
It won't. I promise
I'll never talk as I did today.

567
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:19,000
- Let's drink something.
- You will drink on the ship.

568
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:19,920
What ship?

569
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:20,920
I must go to Beograd!

570
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:21,920
You won't! That's enough!

571
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:25,000
It's you who made the Montenegrian
destroy the German Embassy!

572
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,920
Come on, come on,
don't protest.

573
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:31,000
I promised to the Colonel
that I'll bring you along.

574
01:05:31,000 --> 01:05:34,000
It was an order and
I must execute it.

575
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:34,920
Clear?

576
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,000
- Quite clear. An order...
- Oh...

577
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:41,000
Which Embassy? What
Colonel you are speaking of?

578
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,000
I don't remember anything...
anything at all...

579
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:48,000
I'm not surprised. When they threw you
in the train you were completely drunk.

580
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:49,920
Trava! Trava!

581
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:51,920
Trevora! Trevora!

582
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:55,000
- Hey! Hey! Stop! Stop!
- Polonia di Beogradi.

583
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,000
Dona, Abano, abano
odi glivola, glivola.

584
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:17,920
It's of joy.

585
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,000
Whenever I succeed in escaping
from the Germans I do that.

586
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,000
They must have scared you.
I hope we shan't see them here.

587
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,920
But they will come here too.

588
01:06:26,000 --> 01:06:27,920
When I crossed Hungary,

589
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:29,920
I saw many troops
concentrating at the frontier...

590
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:31,920
Impossible!

591
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:31,920
Quite possible.

592
01:06:32,000 --> 01:06:35,000
We are releasing
our transport unit in Beograd.

593
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,000
Where are you going?
What do you want to do?

594
01:06:49,000 --> 01:06:49,920
What are you doing?

595
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:51,920
You're a soldier and
it's your duty

596
01:06:52,000 --> 01:06:52,920
to join our troops.

597
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,000
My duty is to be there
where I'm neede!

598
01:06:57,000 --> 01:07:00,000
- What's your name?
- Elisabeth!

599
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:03,000
And I'm
Fr... fr... fr... Frank!

600
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:43,920
Silence!

601
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,000
Tisina.

602
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,000
Better get out of here.
He noticed you.

603
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:07,000
I have money...

604
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:12,000
I got it from your soldiers.

605
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:09,000
Take it from her.

606
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:13,000
But who are you?
A Turk?

607
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:14,920
A Pole...

608
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:18,000
Polish soldier... I fled from
the Germans. Understand me?

609
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,000
From a prisoners of war camp
...bu... bu... bu... bum!

610
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,000
...war... bu... bum...

611
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,000
Dimo, it is a Pole.
He is a soldier.

612
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:39,000
He didn't hit anybody today and
therefore looks for a brawl...

613
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
Help me! I want to join your army.

614
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,000
You understand? I want to join
your a-r-m-y! To enlist! To e-n-l-i-s-t!

615
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:50,920
I understand.

616
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:54,000
You want to keep away
from war?

617
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:59,000
I'll try to find for you some job.

618
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:00,920
Why not?

619
01:11:01,000 --> 01:11:04,000
Sixty dollars is not bad.

620
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:11,000
This is a Turkish ship.

621
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:17,000
Yes, sailing to Hamburg.
No kidding.

622
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Sick in other ports.

623
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:26,000
Nobody is willing to sail
to Germany here...

624
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:32,000
This guy will stay on the ship.

625
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:35,000
My name is Dolas, Frank Dolas.

626
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,000
You health!

627
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,000
Damn, how terribly strong!

628
01:11:50,000 --> 01:11:53,000
The waiter told me
you could help me.

629
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:01,920
I would like to enlist. To join
your army. I'm a soldier...

630
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:05,000
I'm sure I might be helpful...

631
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,000
The Germans will be here
any moment...

632
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
To the Navy? No, I want to the Infantry.
You understand? Infantry.

633
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,000
Okay. Let it be Navy.
I'll manage somehow...

634
01:12:31,000 --> 01:12:34,000
Frank Dolas... Do-las...

635
01:12:44,000 --> 01:12:47,000
Long live Yugoslavia!

636
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,000
Where to? A Pole won't go
with you! Get out!

637
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,000
Leave him.
It's not time for quarrels.

638
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,920
How are you?

639
01:15:58,000 --> 01:16:01,000
- Where are you going?
- To Famagusta, Cyprus.

640
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:04,000
You'll be able to join
your army from there.

641
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:08,000
Let him eat, and
give him some work!

642
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:22,000
- Come on! Come on!
- Who is he, Luka?

643
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:32,000
Listen, Drago, this is
a help for you!

644
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
Cheerio!

645
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:51,000
- Oh! I see you're good for this job!
- Sure!

646
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,920
You did you think, that there
are no boilers in Poland?

647
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:56,000
Does not matter.

648
01:16:58,000 --> 01:17:01,000
It's out of work since twelve years.

649
01:17:03,000 --> 01:17:06,000
When the hand of the manometer
drops below the red line

650
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,000
the captain will come here.

651
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:14,000
I see.

652
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:18,000
The best thing then
is to jump in the sea!

653
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:32,000
Funny that you wanted to sail
on board of this washtub!

654
01:17:37,000 --> 01:17:40,000
It was your man with the beard
who brought me here!

655
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,000
I wanted to join your army!

656
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:22,000
Captain! A ship on course!

657
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,920
A commercial steam ship.

658
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
- What distance?
- About five or six miles!

659
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,000
- Action stations!
- Action stations!

660
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:44,920
- Periscopic depth!

661
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:48,000
- Zero, zero five!
- Yes, Sir, zero, zero five!

662
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:51,000
Dive at once!

663
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:03,000
Yugoslavian...

664
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:02,920
small...

665
01:19:03,000 --> 01:19:06,000
- Shall we attack her? With guns?
- We can't come to the surface...

666
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,920
to many British planes...

667
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,000
send the torpedo number 1.

668
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:31,000
Will you manage it?

669
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:34,000
But don't touch it, otherwise
it will blow up... rums... booms...

670
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,000
Good gracious!

671
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,000
No... no!

672
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:17,000
What a bloody mess
I made again!

673
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,920
Let's get away!
Hurry up! Faster!

674
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:30,000
The boiler is going to explode
any moment!

675
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,000
Nobody was left there?

676
01:20:51,000 --> 01:20:52,920
- Are you the last one?
- No...

677
01:20:53,000 --> 01:20:56,000
Where's that Pole?

678
01:20:56,000 --> 01:20:59,000
Come back!

679
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:15,000
Well done!

680
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,000
Shall we send another one?

681
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:21,000
Not necessary.
