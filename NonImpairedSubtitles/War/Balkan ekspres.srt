<i>THE BALKAN EXPRESS</i>

2
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,512
Excuse me sir, do
you have a match?

3
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,870
Of course, I have a lighter.

4
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:20,435
Thank you. - You're welcome.

5
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:55,072
God be with you, soldiers!
- God be with you!

6
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:35,351
There, in that yellow house,
is where I lived with my aunt.

7
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:45,719
See the smoking chimney?
It's coming from her house.

8
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,039
I didn't! I swear on my aunt!

9
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,231
Stop! Police!

10
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,035
He's a thief!
He stole from me!

11
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,635
Leave! Go!

12
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,231
Easy.

13
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,711
Kill the thief!

14
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:45,679
Theif! - Fuck you!
- Take him to jail!

15
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,114
This is a serious business,
just like any other.

16
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,035
I won't stand for improvisations.
Look at you!

17
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,713
I've dressed you from head to toe.

18
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:35,431
You eat, sleep and play
in the best hotels.

19
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,995
And what do I get in return?

20
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,678
Especially you. - You said I
make 300%% % over the norm.

21
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:53,715
You recommended them.
Aces! Champs! Paganini!

22
00:04:54,840 --> 00:05:00,437
Dad said they were.
- Return them to dad.

23
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,230
Don't worry, boss.
My fingers a just a bit rusty.

24
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,512
I haven't practised in 2 yrs.
You know how it is in jail.

25
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,828
No, I don't. I've never been
to jail and I never intend to.

26
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:25,630
<i>When I was a gentle flower,</i>
<i>when life was still new to me,</i>

27
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:33,270
<i>I was given a golden coin,</i>
<i>that shone so brilliantly.</i>

28
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,592
I'd rather listen to this idiot,
at least I don't understand him.

29
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:17,029
The country is falling apart
and they are singing.

30
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,553
HOTEL BRISTOL

31
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:16,276
Come in!

32
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:22,719
Pardon the interruption. It'd be
wise to bring in your instruments.

33
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,430
There are many thieves about.
- Thanks for the warning.

34
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,712
Excuse me and good night.
- Good night.

35
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,190
Did you hear that, kids?
There are thieves about.

36
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:04,354
Put this in your bag and
turn off the light. It's late.

37
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:33,110
Look at all the people on the
streets. Spring has arrived.

38
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:50,910
Hello, reception? Is Mr Stojcic,
from 101 at breakfast?

39
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:55,516
Accompanied by a
lady with wavy hair.

40
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,197
He's left the hotel?
Thank you.

41
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,433
They stole my shoe.

42
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:29,070
What happened? - They stole
my shoe with the money in it!

43
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,318
Why didn't you put
it under your pillow?

44
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,990
Here's your key.

45
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:45,909
Be careful!
Watch out for my leg!

46
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,399
How much? - Apartment 101.
All together, 50.

47
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,829
Thank you. The key, please.

48
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,875
"...the attack was heroically
defended by our anti-aircraft

49
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,230
defence and aviation.

50
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:03,349
The government urges
all citizens not to panic.

51
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:11,357
The army is at full alert and will
not give the enemy an inch..."

52
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:16,276
What happened? - The Germans
have bombed Belgrade.

53
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,511
What did he say? - War.
- What? - War!

54
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,516
I can't hear you!
- The war's started, you deaf idiot!

55
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,829
Oh, war!

56
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:35,635
There's no more time.
Get a move on!

57
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,229
What are you doing, dad?
They'll be here any moment!

58
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:41,273
I have to take my brother.
- Get in the car!

59
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:46,318
Leave everything except
the "Gaugin"! Come on!

60
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,799
Djole, keep to the side roads!

61
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,315
If you use the main roads,
the army might take our car.

62
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,955
Good, the shutters are closed!

63
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,590
Wait! Stop!

64
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,556
The gentlefolk are running scared.

65
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,715
Should we get off here?

66
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:28,314
Thanks, old man.
- Good luck to you!

67
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:12,075
Now, it's your turn.

68
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,550
Cheers!
- Cheers!

69
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,435
You pig!

70
00:15:03,640 --> 00:15:06,871
This war is great, isn't it?

71
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:57,158
Hey count, more champagne!

72
00:15:58,040 --> 00:16:02,318
Come on, old man!

73
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,990
Where's that champagne?

74
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,434
Forget the champagne, you fool!
Get the gold and silver!

75
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:28,198
We have permits for all
directions to the south.

76
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:32,757
Look through the window, you oaf!
You'll see a red BMW.

77
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,077
For us smart people,
there is no war.

78
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:41,631
I'll write to you from Greece,
or maybe even America.

79
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:48,632
Shouldn't we take them along,
boss? They're so helpless.

80
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,079
Scram! I'm not a home for invalids!

81
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,512
Surround them!!

82
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,480
Colonel, allow me to explain.

83
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,070
Our passes are in order.
We're on a special mission.

84
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,789
This is our home. We're packing.
- What?

85
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,150
We're leaving.
- This is my brother's home!

86
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,760
I'll be the judge here!

87
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,757
Put me down,
I can't go any further.

88
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:59,757
I have no vacant apartments.
I hope this will suit you.

89
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:26,071
Where will we go, when this
bloodsucker kicks us out?

90
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,678
Don't you have any
relatives we could go to?

91
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,428
A brother or mother? Someone
must have given birth to you.

92
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:37,355
I don't have a mother.
My aunt gave birth to me.

93
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:45,394
I have an aunt in Stara Varos.
It's 2 hours by train.

94
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,478
We never seem able
to say good-bye.

95
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:52,269
Shall we try there?

96
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,791
You're kind, all of a sudden.
- Why would you invite us?

97
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:04,515
You're a sly one, Lily.
No man is safe with you.

98
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:09,714
We don't need her.
- We'll pass easier as a trio.

99
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,755
You're only men.
- I definitely am.

100
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,429
So, we're going?

101
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,555
Put it there!

102
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,395
Good night.

103
00:20:56,440 --> 00:21:00,319
Do not worry, life takes care,

104
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:04,559
while there are people,
money is there.

105
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,153
What's your aunt like?
Will she take us in?

106
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,994
She's a failed musician.

107
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,390
Now she's a beach keeper,
but still a nice lady.

108
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,436
Who is it?

109
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,710
It's me.
- Which me? Go to hell!

110
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:25,197
Nice lady!
- It's me, Lily!

111
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,553
Here's a present, aunty.
- Stong, excellent, plum brandy.

112
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:44,152
You sound like... lt's you, Lily!
- It's me and I'm really tired.

113
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:50,070
Who are these two?
- They're my friends, musicians.

114
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,716
"...you are the pain in my heart..."
I'm only joking, ma'am.

115
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:58,118
They're from Belgrade, aunty.
- Come inside. Come on!

116
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:11,433
Bon appetite, Popeye.

117
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:17,872
Let's see what you can do.
Come on!

118
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:28,635
Get up, Pik.
- What is it?

119
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,399
Come on!

120
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:37,112
What is it?
- She wants us to play.

121
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,030
Good morning. - Good morning.

122
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:11,276
GERMANY IS VICTORIOUS
ON ALL FRONTS

123
00:24:58,040 --> 00:25:03,353
Be careful, ma'am!
- I'm sorry, I didn't see you.

124
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:09,550
Spinach for this amount.
- There's not enough for 2 kg.

125
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,957
What? - It's not enough.
- That's highway robbery!

126
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,919
Are you buying or not?
- Weigh it first.

127
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,478
By order of the town's
German Commander,

128
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:28,873
we are now recruiting
for compulsary labour.

129
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:35,633
All unemployed men
between 18 and 60,

130
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,511
must report to the
German Command.

131
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,870
He asked if you'll dance with him.
Say you won't.

132
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,596
They're bombing us and we're
supposed to dance with them.

133
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:10,429
I don't want to make trouble.
One dance won't hurt.

134
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,518
What does he want?
- He wants me to sing for them.

135
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:17,437
Which song? - Lily Marlene.
- On one, two, three...

136
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:27,275
I won't sing! - Don't be crazy!
You know the Germans.

137
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:45,077
Well, will you start? - No.

138
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,789
Sing! - I don't know that song.

139
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:54,879
You should have learned it.
- I don't won't to.

140
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,549
I'll sing it for you.

141
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,429
Will you sing, or not?

142
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,997
No.

143
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,269
He's a fool!
They can do whatever they want.

144
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:44,474
Good on him, as long
as he doesn't give in.

145
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:49,909
My friend, in times
like these, heads fly!

146
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:54,199
Why didn't he sing?
He's paid to.

147
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:59,355
It's not that simple.
- There's something called pride.

148
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:04,760
Go and defend him!
They're beating him, go on!

149
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:45,472
Waiter! Are you deaf?

150
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,955
1.8.1940.

151
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:59,038
Aunty, why don't you join us?
- I'll never eat that!

152
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:14,069
Kid, pack your things and leave!

153
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,676
Sit down.

154
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,992
As soon as we finish our meal,
we'll be leaving.

155
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,473
Is it too spicy for you?

156
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,994
Stupid Krauts! They've left
their wagons unlocked.

157
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,917
Get in!

158
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:54,477
Faster!

159
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:26,271
Let's go!

160
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:53,150
Jump! - My leg! - Jump!

161
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:02,118
Jump! What are you waiting for?

162
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:26,315
I told you the town was fenced in,
but you wouldn't listen.

163
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:29,513
I thought... - Don't bullshit!

164
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,034
The only chance you have
is to play until this is over.

165
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:37,198
You'll play at my funeral.

166
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:42,554
I can't even lift my leg.
- That can be fatal.

167
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:29,590
Go on, Lily. He's so cute!

168
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:50,835
You despised her for dancing
with him, now you're forcing her.

169
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,199
I've been thinking about you.
- What do you mean?

170
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:59,871
I'll give Lily the houseboat key.

171
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:06,439
And? - Captain Dietrich can
spend the night with her.

172
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:13,150
What night?
- Night time is our time.

173
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:04,556
They've only just started.
- What? - In bed.

174
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:07,832
What's he been doing
till now? Let's go!

175
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,233
Take it easy, you'll kill him!
Are you crazy?

176
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:32,349
He needs artificial respiration.
He drank half the river.

177
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,109
He'll die because of your oar,
not the river.

178
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:38,517
Give him mouth-to-mouth,
while I massage him.

179
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:48,915
I can't kiss a man, you do it.
- I can't do it, forget it!

180
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:21,279
Do you think he'll remember us?

181
00:45:21,480 --> 00:45:26,270
You don't forget such things.
We saved his life.

182
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:46,950
I expected a thank you note
and canned food.

183
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:53,998
Germans are usually precise.
He must have told someone.

184
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:59,834
All we need are the passes
so that we can leave.

185
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,879
There he is.

186
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,320
By order of the German Command,

187
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:29,309
because of the criminal attack
on a German miltary truck,

188
00:46:29,720 --> 00:46:36,796
and the wounding of a soldier,
10 Serbian civilians will be shot.

189
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:15,234
Is he looking? - Yes.

190
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,996
What do you think?

191
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,438
I know he's talking about us.

192
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,869
Lily's coming this way.

193
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:53,752
He said you're staring at him and
sending strange signals. - Us?

194
00:47:55,080 --> 00:48:01,155
We saved him from drowning,
now he doesn't know us.

195
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,638
He didn't mention it.
I'll ask him.

196
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:11,156
You're insane!

197
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:15,915
What did we do?
- Now I understand everything.

198
00:48:35,840 --> 00:48:38,195
Look, he's smiling.

199
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:48,749
He's smiling.

200
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:03,071
Dietrich remembers you saving
him, but no one must know.

201
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:08,673
Why? - He was on duty that night.
If they find out he left his post,

202
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:12,510
they'll send him
to the Russian Front,

203
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:17,476
and us to the camp.
So, keep your mouths shut!

204
00:49:18,640 --> 00:49:21,393
He already thinks
you're suspicious.

205
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:35,398
Put another brandy on my tab.

206
00:50:57,040 --> 00:50:59,190
He's alive. - Is he?

207
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:15,871
Are you Partisans? - No!

208
00:51:17,200 --> 00:51:20,476
Partisans... attack... you.

209
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:25,599
Partisans... attack... you.
Understand?

210
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,876
We saved you from them.

211
00:51:28,840 --> 00:51:31,035
I'm a Communist!

212
00:51:36,360 --> 00:51:38,555
No, you stupid Kraut!

213
00:51:38,880 --> 00:51:43,829
You're a fascist, we saved
you from the Partisans!

214
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:47,589
I'm a Communist! No, why...?

215
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,520
Wait. I'll try to explain it him.

216
00:51:56,360 --> 00:52:00,558
Wait! Calm down!
Partisans... in woods.

217
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:03,115
How do you say woods
in German?

218
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,760
We... here... friends.

219
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,792
Understand?

220
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:14,913
Yes, my Communist brother.

221
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:18,317
Explain it to him.
- He's crazy!

222
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:28,076
One bandits... you head... bash...
...tell him. - That he knows.

223
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,831
...we helper... you!

224
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:49,350
Hitler is kaput!
Hitler is swine!

225
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,230
Fuck off!

226
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,112
I'm going to beat
the crap out of him!

227
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:21,869
Pik, where's my watch?

228
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,598
Where's my watch?
- It was there last night.

229
00:53:29,440 --> 00:53:33,194
That damned Kraut stole it!

230
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,189
Your Doxa? - You idiot,
it was a Schaffhausen!

231
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:49,397
I can't believe he tricked me!
A soldier, yet scum!

232
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:52,757
A German soldier at that,
known for their discipline.

233
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:02,959
I spent 3 months in jail
because of that watch!

234
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,194
You want to achieve something?

235
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:13,510
They don't want Moscow or London,
all they want is my watch!

236
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,878
A great army, a great power?

237
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:21,199
I'll throw a bomb on your
warehouse or barracks!

238
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:24,831
Be quiet. - I won't,
they stole my watch!

239
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,190
Fuck the watch!
Watch your hide.

240
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,308
You'll remember Popeye!
An eye for an eye!

241
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,390
Shitheads!

242
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:26,036
Only idiots like you would
set fire to a full warehouse.

243
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,316
Who's that?
- A vampire.

244
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,719
Unlike fools, smart
people have 9 lives.

245
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:11,119
Coffee, sugar, flour, lard,
oil, ham and tobacco.

246
00:56:11,720 --> 00:56:14,518
Don't worry, you'll get some.

247
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:20,040
Two more crates
and you're finished.

248
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:28,919
Don't! People are starving and
you want to burn it all down!

249
00:56:29,200 --> 00:56:32,909
We could live a year on this!

250
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,238
These goods are
first class quality.

251
00:56:37,000 --> 00:56:39,912
Get in, Lily!

252
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:47,759
I'm staying. - I'll be back.

253
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,638
Madame, help yourself.

254
00:57:33,080 --> 00:57:36,550
What are you doing here,
enjoying yourselves?

255
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,549
How about helping those who
are fighting the war for you?

256
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:45,868
Dig the mines, instead of robbing
the Reich for the black market.

257
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,675
We're waiting for work
from the employment office.

258
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:54,715
I want you dressed and ready
at the gate in 3 minutes!

259
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:59,874
Go home! Scram!

260
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,036
Hey, you! Yes, you!

261
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,916
Come here!

262
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:25,714
Do you have a work permit?
- I'm the lifeguard here.

263
00:58:26,320 --> 00:58:30,598
While Europe is in flames,
you're lounging in the shade.

264
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:37,914
Actually, I'm a musician.
We'll be playing on the terrace.

265
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:41,631
Are you going to get dressed
or go in those pants?

266
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,112
I can't believe how many
bums there are around here.

267
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,119
Hey, you! - I just have to
give my aunt her medicine.

268
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:57,553
Are you also a musician?
- No, I'm not.

269
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,870
You're not? - I am.

270
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:05,029
You are? - I am.
- So, you are? - No, I'm not.

271
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:09,392
Just let me take...

272
00:59:09,640 --> 00:59:12,552
She can manage without you.
Go to the gate, immediately!

273
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:17,356
Sir, they're musicians,
artists. - Artists?

274
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:21,559
Educated people from Belgrade.
They're not for the mines.

275
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:25,674
Work in the mines will
be invigorating for them.

276
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,076
To the gate! Now!

277
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,755
Tell him it's a mistake!

278
01:00:21,000 --> 01:00:23,275
We have nothing
to do with this!

279
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:27,752
This is not our war!
- Stop shitting in your pants!

280
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:46,792
You, and you, get out!

281
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,916
Over there.

282
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,630
There are rumours...

283
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,953
that the local population is
hostile towards our army.

284
01:01:46,200 --> 01:01:50,239
Can there be a better example
that this is not true?

285
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:58,632
Proof of this, are these
brave Serbian citizens.

286
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:05,439
Once again, I thank them
and congratulate them.

287
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:05,477
"You are the pain in
my heart, all my desires.

288
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:13,914
When I die, your tiny
hand on my shoulder..."

289
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:19,592
Well ma'am,
we're here to stay.

290
01:04:19,880 --> 01:04:23,873
Not only that, we're now
safe from the Germans.

291
01:04:24,080 --> 01:04:28,551
All thanks to you. - I didn't
do anything. - Yes, you did.

292
01:04:28,840 --> 01:04:30,239
Cheers!

293
01:04:32,960 --> 01:04:36,270
A small present for you.

294
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:42,588
What is it?
- Silverware for 6.

295
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:46,072
Is it real silver?
- They're stamped.

296
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:54,036
I think you'll like it here.
- I think I will.

297
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,070
Have you seen the newspaper?

298
01:05:19,960 --> 01:05:23,430
What is it? Let me see.

299
01:05:24,560 --> 01:05:28,872
Hey, it's us! Look at me!

300
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:34,233
"Serbian citizens save German
soldier from bandits."

301
01:05:34,520 --> 01:05:37,717
It turns out that we're with
the Germans, but we're not!

302
01:05:38,000 --> 01:05:42,198
How are we going to explain
this? Look at you grinning!

303
01:05:42,640 --> 01:05:44,790
I've never been
involved in politics.

304
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:47,435
I swore to my aunt
that I never would.

305
01:05:48,040 --> 01:05:52,716
Who would have thought the
Krauts would publicise this?

306
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:56,873
What a pack of lies!
A pack of bandits!

307
01:05:57,360 --> 01:06:00,432
Tears of joy because
we saved the milkman.

308
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:03,558
They say I made a speech.

309
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,030
I wasn't even listening
to their bullshit!

310
01:06:06,320 --> 01:06:09,551
All I did was eat, drink and
think of how to get my watch.

311
01:06:11,120 --> 01:06:13,759
What is it?
- What was that?

312
01:06:28,080 --> 01:06:33,473
"Death to German collaborators!"

313
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,194
Where's your boyfriend?

314
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:01,873
The town is in chaos.
They're chasing allies.

315
01:07:02,200 --> 01:07:03,519
Who?

316
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:10,273
They shot down an American
plane. The pilots parachuted.

317
01:07:10,800 --> 01:07:16,796
The Krauts are raiding the town.
Someone's hiding them.

318
01:07:17,280 --> 01:07:20,590
Dietrich is furious. - Forget
the pilots. Get out the cans.

319
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:26,079
Pilots? It couldn't have
happened at a better time.

320
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:30,719
I know who could... Max!

321
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:35,711
Who's Max?
- Max the Communist, a good man.

322
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,119
I don't know what
you're talking about.

323
01:07:59,320 --> 01:08:04,792
Max, I've lived here 40 years
and I know eveything.

324
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:08,152
Give us one American.
We need to hide him.

325
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:11,830
I know you have them.
Only you can hide them.

326
01:08:12,080 --> 01:08:16,949
Listen, Max. They're accusing
us of being collaborators.

327
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:19,720
We have to prove
that we're not traitors.

328
01:08:19,920 --> 01:08:23,595
No one suspects me. There's
plenty of space at the beach.

329
01:08:23,840 --> 01:08:27,879
I was always for the Americans,
especially the air force.

330
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:32,238
We'll take care of him. - I don't
know what you're talking about.

331
01:08:32,520 --> 01:08:36,433
All right then, I'll go and
get the German patrol.

332
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:39,234
If you're not hiding anyone,
you have nothing to fear.

333
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:43,639
Wait! - Wait! - You're
too late for the Americans.

334
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:47,316
I've already sent them
to a liberated zone.

335
01:08:47,560 --> 01:08:50,393
If you really want
to prove yourselves,

336
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:56,158
I have someone for you.
- Allies? - Jews.

337
01:08:58,280 --> 01:09:00,840
They've already been
sent to the camps.

338
01:09:01,120 --> 01:09:04,510
That's all I have to offer.
You decide.

339
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,191
Go over there!

340
01:10:52,400 --> 01:10:54,436
Sit there and wait!

341
01:11:05,160 --> 01:11:10,632
What's your name? - Lea.
And yours? - Popeye.

342
01:11:13,680 --> 01:11:17,798
Popeye the sailor man,
Lea's looking for him.

343
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,157
Popeye the crazy man,
put Lea into a bin.

344
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:26,674
Okay, go to sleep now.
- Tell me a story about Popeye.

345
01:11:42,080 --> 01:11:45,959
Once upon a time, there
was a man named Popeye...

346
01:12:51,240 --> 01:12:54,630
As a warning to anyone
disobeying orders of the

347
01:12:54,960 --> 01:13:02,150
German Command and hides
Jews, Gypsies or Communists,

348
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:07,833
Maksim Stefanovic will be
executed by firing squad.

349
01:13:08,120 --> 01:13:11,157
The sentence will be
carried out at once.

350
01:13:11,400 --> 01:13:15,916
The 3 Jews found hiding in
the mill at Maksim Stevanovic,

351
01:13:16,240 --> 01:13:23,476
will also be executed.
Colonel Joseph Muller.

352
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,511
May I speak?

353
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:30,514
Only if it concerns the
Jewish girl. - Yes.

354
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,270
He might betray us.

355
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:44,550
Where is she?
- In a safe place.

356
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:32,590
If they find her, we're done for.
They'll look everywhere.

357
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:38,033
Let someone else look after her.
- The girl stays with us.

358
01:14:57,320 --> 01:14:58,958
Run, Pik!

359
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:18,234
We have to leave
as soon as possible.

360
01:15:18,440 --> 01:15:21,238
Where? How?
- I don't know.

361
01:15:21,520 --> 01:15:26,799
Don't worry, you can stay.
We're leaving.

362
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:35,917
Damn you! You're leaving just
as I was getting used to you.

363
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:41,388
I'll be on my own again.

364
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:49,549
Lily went to Captain Dietrich
to ask for the passes.

365
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:53,117
As an orchestra, we can
travel throughout Serbia.

366
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:57,518
Why didn't you say anything?
- Why? The chances are slim.

367
01:16:00,600 --> 01:16:05,037
I'm offering you a chance.
- Here's your vampire again.

368
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:08,558
You brute!
You almost killed me!

369
01:16:09,440 --> 01:16:16,471
What are you staring at?
I have a proposition. - Get lost!

370
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:22,599
Wait! Maybe he can
help us get out of here.

371
01:16:22,960 --> 01:16:27,397
I've seen many Kraut warehouses,
but this one is special.

372
01:16:27,720 --> 01:16:30,917
It's packed to the brim.
- So what?

373
01:16:31,400 --> 01:16:37,873
I can see you want to clear out.
I also have to leave.

374
01:16:38,240 --> 01:16:44,315
We clear out the warehouse, trade
the goods, then straight to Greece.

375
01:16:44,920 --> 01:16:47,229
How do we get out of here?

376
01:16:47,520 --> 01:16:51,672
We trade the goods for gold,
and the gold for documents.

377
01:16:52,520 --> 01:16:55,239
I'm offering you a chance.

378
01:17:02,880 --> 01:17:06,111
What if there's shooting again?

379
01:17:06,440 --> 01:17:10,115
You know I plan
everything in style.

380
01:17:10,360 --> 01:17:14,592
Can I get out of this stove?
Hey, are you listening?

381
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,833
Listen child,
we're going on a trip.

382
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:06,672
What have you got?
- Three of a kind.

383
01:18:07,800 --> 01:18:10,439
You're better!
I've got two pairs.

384
01:18:13,360 --> 01:18:16,272
Someone's coming, hide!

385
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:26,312
Get the instruments!

386
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:29,275
Are you inside? - Yes.

387
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,270
What is it? - Germans!
- We're being chased!

388
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:42,673
I hope they didn't recognise us!

389
01:18:50,720 --> 01:18:54,872
What are we going to play?
- "The Stars Are Echoing".

390
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:10,231
What did he say?

391
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:14,598
He'll give us the passes
after tomorrow's performance.

392
01:21:16,280 --> 01:21:22,992
I don't want to hide anymore!
- Scram! - Don't yell at her!

393
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:26,112
Let's get out of here!

394
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:31,679
Why? Tomorrow at the ball,
we'll play a song or two, then go.

395
01:21:31,880 --> 01:21:35,634
How many guests will there be?
- It's the Commander's birthday.

396
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,310
There'll be officers and those
who are in with the Germans.

397
01:21:39,520 --> 01:21:41,397
Ladies and gentlemen.

398
01:21:41,680 --> 01:21:47,312
That means jewellery, rings,
necklaces. We're staying!

399
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,799
No one has died here
in the last twenty years!

400
01:22:03,080 --> 01:22:04,991
But they might!

401
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:09,478
Whoever moves,
I'll be reading their requiem!

402
01:22:15,520 --> 01:22:16,999
Bosko!

403
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:21,274
You're in with the Germans!
- What are you talking about?

404
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:26,918
Traitors, scum!
- We're not traitors!

405
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,714
You'll have to prove it!

406
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:38,958
Lea, come out!
- No, I'm afraid!

407
01:22:59,960 --> 01:23:02,076
Who's the gentleman?
- He's a waiter.

408
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:05,557
He wasted a German,
then escaped to the woods.

409
01:23:06,160 --> 01:23:11,359
It's worse here than in the corso!
People always going in and out!

410
01:23:14,520 --> 01:23:17,239
Can I speak freely
in front of him?

411
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:22,628
I'm not into politics.
My field is finance.

412
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:27,319
You're playing tomorrow night?
- That's the deal.

413
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:32,550
We get the passes, then leave.
- What do you want to say?

414
01:23:33,680 --> 01:23:38,196
We want to set explosives here,
to make the ball really great.

415
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:44,915
Here? - Where are we to go?
- We're leaving tomorrow.

416
01:23:45,200 --> 01:23:49,318
You're not going anywhere!
Understood?

417
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:55,910
Could you get me across the river?
I'd go to my sister, up north.

418
01:23:56,240 --> 01:24:00,472
If there's space, I'd also go.

419
01:24:00,920 --> 01:24:05,630
We'd help your movement
from the background.

420
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:08,434
Whatever is needed in secret,
we're here.

421
01:24:08,720 --> 01:24:14,431
We are thieves.
- Speak for yourselves!

422
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:18,229
All right.

423
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:22,829
You help me place the
explosives under the terrace,

424
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,790
I'll take you across the river.

425
01:24:26,080 --> 01:24:31,996
How, if you blow us up.
We play on that terrace.

426
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:38,716
When you stop playing,
you'll have 4 minutes to get away.

427
01:24:38,920 --> 01:24:43,596
That's the length of the fuse.
Be careful, only 4 minutes.

428
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:47,793
Go straight to the boat,
I'll be waiting.

429
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:55,678
Bosko, we have to discuss this.
- We'll see.

430
01:26:05,360 --> 01:26:10,718
<i>When I was a gentle flower,</i>
<i>when life was still new to me,</i>

431
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:18,156
<i>I was given a golden coin,</i>
<i>that shone so brilliantly.</i>

432
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:22,558
<i>Don't worry, life takes care,</i>

433
01:26:22,880 --> 01:26:27,032
<i>while there are people,</i>
<i>money is there.</i>

434
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:59,269
<i>Once when I was out alone,</i>
<i>the golden coin lost did I,</i>

435
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:06,113
<i>many a day has passed since then,</i>
<i>till this day I cry.</i>

436
01:27:06,480 --> 01:27:10,996
<i>Don't worry, life takes care,</i>

437
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:15,273
<i>while there are people,</i>
<i>money is there.</i>

438
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:47,550
<i>Now that I am a flower in bloom,</i>
<i>a handsome fellow I did see,</i>

439
01:27:47,960 --> 01:27:54,513
<i>another gold coin, I was given</i>
<i>that shone so brilliantly.</i>

440
01:27:55,000 --> 01:27:59,437
<i>Don't worry, life takes care,</i>

441
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:03,548
<i>while there are people,</i>
<i>money is there.</i>

442
01:32:30,280 --> 01:32:33,431
He wants us to continue playing.

443
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:44,875
Sir, the music is kaput.
Can we have the passes, please?

444
01:33:09,250 --> 01:33:11,559
Nobody move!

445
01:33:53,970 --> 01:33:56,484
Run! Run!

446
01:34:31,690 --> 01:34:36,810
Popeye, push the boat!
Push it now!

447
01:35:49,370 --> 01:35:51,964
Tell me about Popeye again.

448
01:35:57,090 --> 01:36:04,770
Once upon a time,
there was a man named Popeye.

449
01:36:05,050 --> 01:36:07,006
What did he eat?

450
01:36:10,530 --> 01:36:12,441
Spinach.

451
01:36:13,010 --> 01:36:15,683
What was he like?

452
01:36:20,090 --> 01:36:23,878
He was the best and the strongest!

453
01:36:24,770 --> 01:36:27,489
Who did he love?

454
01:36:31,130 --> 01:36:38,206
Who did he love? -You.
-At long last, you said it.

455
01:37:38,351 --> 01:37:41,980
