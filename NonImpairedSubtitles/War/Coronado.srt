00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,036
Yeah, why did you come?

00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:16,747
How much time

9
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,613
Sit down

11
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,218
Okay

12
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:31,022
Do you know my fiance
Will Gallagher?

13
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:33,425
- We heard about him
- We heard him

14
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:36,727
He went to Switzerland on a business trip

15
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,766
He gets to go to
postcard country

16
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:41,030
l get to stay home
You get the picture?

17
00:05:43,476 --> 00:05:46,468
But, he forgot some documents

18
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:48,271
Will!

19
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:49,778
Will!

20
00:05:53,152 --> 00:05:56,053
l was gonna drop them in the mail
but then l thought.

21
00:05:56,556 --> 00:06:00,083
why not make this
our first Christmas together?

22
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,692
Snow- capped mountains

23
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,987
Swiss chocolate
yodelers in the street a.

24
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,893
a cozy fireplace in a chalet

25
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,591
l didnt take long
to convince myself

26
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:41,723
Everything was exactly
as l imagined it.

27
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:44,436
except for Will's office

28
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,967
Excuse me

36
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,097
So much for the cozy fire place

37
00:07:18,337 --> 00:07:19,304
Now l dont know

38
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:21,234
if you've ever been
to Switzerland but.

39
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,738
They've got these computers

40
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,536
for phone books, you know
hi- tech yellow pages

41
00:07:25,745 --> 00:07:27,144
Very impressive

l found nothing

44
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,116
What did you do?

45
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,312
The obvious

46
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:42,423
l ate half a chocolate cake
and called my best friend Rita

47
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,823
Where did you get
the P.O. box address?

48
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,124
From, from the envelope
that Will left at home

49
00:07:47,366 --> 00:07:48,765
the one that he wanted me
to send to him

50
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,435
So whats in the envelope?

51
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:53,168
lm opening it

52
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,976
Claire?

53
00:07:59,178 --> 00:08:00,805
Are you there?

54
00:08:01,013 --> 00:08:01,911
l'm here

55
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,407
- Only Will isn't
- What?

56
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,578
l just found his flight itinerary

57
00:08:08,788 --> 00:08:10,483
and he never even
came to Switzerland

58
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:17,095
- He went to El Coronado?
- Oh my God, he's having an affair

59
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,287
You haul your ass all the way
to the Matterhorn

60
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,990
and he's off screwing someone in

61
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,135
Where did you say he was?

62
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,238
l can't even think right now

63
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,238
Claire, l am so sorry

64
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:32,240
l'm gonna call you later Rita

65
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,441
l was so angry
But l was also worried

66
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:40,017
And then l got more angry
because l was worried

67
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:41,311
Why did he have
to lie to me?

68
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,115
And then he had to go to the most
obscure place on the planet

69
00:08:44,323 --> 00:08:45,517
no offense

70
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:48,125
Coronado?

71
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,225
Where the hell is Coronado?

72
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:16,778
l hadnt really packed for Central America

73
00:09:16,989 --> 00:09:19,389
But nothing was
gonna stop me now

74
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:53,815
- Do you need cupons?
- No, no thank you

75
00:09:54,026 --> 00:09:54,822
- Take a look
- No thank you

76
00:09:55,027 --> 00:09:56,016
- Look, l'll give them to you
- l need a taxi

77
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:58,219
- Look, its valid forthirty days
- No, no

78
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,126
- l'll give it to you at a good price
- No, no, no little boys, no

79
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:01,630
- Move. Please
- No

80
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,425
- Come on move
- Oh, please

81
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:04,328
- Not now. Look, lll give it
- Senor

82
00:10:04,570 --> 00:10:05,366
- No one will give it
- l am not, no, no, no

83
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:06,538
l'm now buying
anything from you

84
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,171
l am not buying
anything from you

85
00:10:08,374 --> 00:10:10,274
- No one will
- Comprende, no, no!

86
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:13,167
Taxi!

87
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:38,361
Hey

88
00:10:40,706 --> 00:10:41,900
Just arrived?

89
00:10:47,213 --> 00:10:49,807
So
how do you like it so far?

90
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:51,975
Paradise

91
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:53,879
Arnet, l got a perfect place
to shoot the stand- up

92
00:10:54,086 --> 00:10:56,179
We've gotta go now
before somebody blows it up

93
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,481
Excuse me

94
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:02,017
The military splinter group
led by General Rafael

95
00:11:02,228 --> 00:11:03,923
is becoming more and more powerful

96
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,360
as witnessed by todays attack

97
00:11:05,531 --> 00:11:09,023
on the governments military
installations at El Coronados airport

98
00:11:09,268 --> 00:11:11,828
Rebel sources say that
these small tactical attacks

99
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,470
are only attempts
to bleed out

100
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:16,767
President Hugo Luis Ramo's
military power

101
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:20,173
a tactic which for now
appears to be working

102
00:11:20,379 --> 00:11:22,279
For C.B.B.
l'm Arnet McClure

103
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:25,077
All right, cut it Renny

104
00:11:25,251 --> 00:11:26,741
Excuse me

105
00:11:26,952 --> 00:11:29,250
Can you please recommend
a decent hotel?

106
00:11:29,455 --> 00:11:30,649
Look, in case you havent noticed

107
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,450
- this isnt exactly a tourist place
- Oh, really?

108
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:35,354
You mean there isn't
good skiing here?

109
00:11:35,561 --> 00:11:36,755
- Come on
- Take the, take the Grand

110
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:38,452
lt's the only one
without cockroaches

111
00:11:38,664 --> 00:11:39,961
Good luck

112
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:42,361
Hey do you wanna
do you wanna share a cab?

113
00:11:42,601 --> 00:11:43,898
Thanks, we're fine

114
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,214

00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:03,410

- Here ya go

by the name of Will Gallagher?

123
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:32,278
- Actually l have a picture
- No, l have never seen this man

124
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:34,146
lf l had

125
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:36,844
Okay, okay

126
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,453
- Welcome to our hotel
- Thank you

127
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,223
What did you say to him?

128
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,924
l said

129
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,425
l said that you were
really a man

130
00:13:23,169 --> 00:13:25,729
- You, you did what?
- l'm kidding

131
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,269
- l said you were my wife
- That's funny

132
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,874
Gosh, that's almost as funny as you
leaving me on the street today

133
00:13:31,076 --> 00:13:33,067
Oh, ow, we're still
angry about that

134
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,076
Well lm sorry
l had to get some footage

135
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,681
of the airport for the
uh, New York feed

136
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:40,148
Look l'll make it up to you
l'll buy you another drink

137
00:13:42,454 --> 00:13:44,445
- Not you, her

00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,555
Well its not gonna

139
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:47,055
Well who says
l wanna get drunk?

140
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:49,159
Well why else would
a tourist wanna be here?

141
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:52,262
Oh, maybe you haven't heard
This isn't exactly a tourist place

142
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:53,453
Touche

143
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,362
- Are you from the states?
- No, l'm a native

144
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,661
- Whats your name?
- Claire

145
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:01,236
- Arnet McClure
- Hello, Arnet

146
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,634
Hello, Claire

147
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:05,235
How long have you been
down here?

148
00:14:05,444 --> 00:14:07,241
About two years
when all hell broke loose

149
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,845
But then you probably
recognize me

150
00:14:09,048 --> 00:14:10,743
l'm the one
who did all the

151
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,316
reports on the attempted
rebel coup about a year ago

152
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,510
- Oh my God
- Yeah

153
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,814
- That was you
- That was me

154
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:19,217
l didn't see it

155
00:14:20,426 --> 00:14:21,222
Well, you know

156
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:22,621
you should really pay better attention cause

157
00:14:22,828 --> 00:14:26,229
it's your tax dollars that keep
the government in power down here

158
00:14:26,432 --> 00:14:28,923
A full- blown revolution
could break out at any minute

159
00:14:29,168 --> 00:14:30,226
You trying to scare me?

160
00:14:30,469 --> 00:14:31,868
No, l'm just saying
you shouldn't be here

161
00:14:32,071 --> 00:14:33,538
unless you have
a damn good reason to be

162
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:35,740
Okay, well first of all
l can take care of myself

163
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,068
And second of all
l do have a damn good reason

164
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:39,676
Would that reasons name be
Will Gallagher?

165
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:42,074
- Do you know him?
- No

166
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:43,771
l heard you say his name
at the front desk

167
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,746
Do you always eavesdrop
on peoples conversations?

168
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:48,146
Yeah l do
l'm a reporter

169
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:50,049
So, why are you
looking for Will?

170
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,250
Fiance

171
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,859
How'd you lose
your fiance?

172
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:59,360
l don't think the story's
good enough for your network

173
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:00,998
Fine, just trying to help

174
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,395
Well, why don't ya help me
find my fiance?

175
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:05,103
You know l'm sorry
l'm gonna be gone tomorrow

176
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:07,532
l got a little expedition
into rebel territory

177
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,832
But you oughtta check with
the uh, American Embassy

178
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,533
They keep pretty
good tabs on the Americans

179
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:15,145
- that come in and out of here
- Thank you very much, Mr. Reporter

180
00:15:15,347 --> 00:15:18,248
- Good luck on your quest
- Good luck on your quest

181
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:25,417
After checking all the hotels
and all the hospitals in town

182
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,319
the Embassy seemed
to be a good idea

183
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:29,619
Your fiance
could be anywhere

184
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:32,524
He arrived on December eleventh
l have him down right here

185
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,427
Look

186
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,128
the U.S. government supports
the Coronado government

187
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:40,668
under President Ramos

188
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,967
So the rebels don't
exactly love U.S. citizens

189
00:15:44,176 --> 00:15:47,077
l don't wanna alarm you
but there have been twenty- two reported cases

190
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,180
of U.S. citizens being
kidnapped by the rebels

191
00:15:50,349 --> 00:15:53,250
l only hope that your fiance
isn't number twenty- three

192
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,647
Well

193
00:15:55,854 --> 00:15:57,549
why would he even be in Coronado?

194
00:15:57,756 --> 00:15:59,656
l mean he never
mentioned it before

195
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,088
You said he had some
documents written in Spanish?

196
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,489
Well obviously he was here
on some sort of business

197
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:07,097
No, no, no, no
No No

198
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:10,393
He uh, he was doing
business in Switzerland

199
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,934
He has a post office box
thats in Zurich

200
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,231
And l have
a time share in Maui

201
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:17,432
Look theres nothing we can do

202
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,042
Right now we're
working frantically

203
00:16:19,244 --> 00:16:21,644
just to establish contact
with the rebel leaders

204
00:16:21,847 --> 00:16:23,144
But so far without any luck

205
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,249
Okay, well that doesn't seem
like an awfully big country

206
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:27,009
- Why don't we just get
- Miss

207
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,719
Roughly a quarter
of this country

208
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:33,915
is now rebel territory

209
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:35,320
and they're expanding

210
00:16:35,527 --> 00:16:40,123
That's thirty thousand square miles
of desert, mountain and jungle

211
00:16:40,332 --> 00:16:42,323
Can you imagine trying
to find somebody in that?

212
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,869
We don't even know
where the main rebel base is

213
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,529
And it dawned on me that
that's exactly what l'd have to find

214
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,472
My God

215
00:16:56,682 --> 00:16:58,172
The Grand Hotel

216
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:37,611
West wing, huh?

217
00:17:37,823 --> 00:17:40,314
Well, least you got your view

218
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:44,227
Why would they do this?

219
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,330
Because the west wing
is full of brass

220
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,228
- Brass?
- Military, high- ranking officials

221
00:17:49,468 --> 00:17:51,231
Listen

222
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,937
Honey, you wanna stay

223
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:56,266
as far away from
the military as possible, nope

224
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:00,508
Could l uh, could l
take you up on your offer?

225
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:02,111
- What offer?
- You, you said

226
00:18:02,314 --> 00:18:04,612
that you were trying to help
Could you take me to the rebels?

227
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:06,182
You wanna fight?

228
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:07,875
Well they have my fiance

229
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,384
What, hostage?

230
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:11,283
- What did he do?
- l don't know

231
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,286
Okay wait

232
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:14,186
You want me
to give you a ride?

233
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:17,387
That would be so very great
Thank you

234
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,790
- Thank you
- To the rebels?

235
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:21,297
Then what?

236
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:23,931
Then l'll, l'll
have to rescue him

237
00:18:24,136 --> 00:18:25,194
Right, by yourself

238
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,496
- Yeah
- ln the jungle?

239
00:18:27,739 --> 00:18:29,707
ln your evening dress?

240
00:18:29,942 --> 00:18:33,434
- You don't even speak Spanish
- Well l speak a little Spanish

241
00:18:33,645 --> 00:18:35,340
My maid speaks
Spanish at home

242
00:18:35,547 --> 00:18:37,538
Whoa, Whoopee
Big deal

243
00:18:37,716 --> 00:18:40,207
What are you gonna do
go politely knock on the rebels door and say

244
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,320
- please release my uh, fiance?
- Now, now, now

245
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:46,218
No one said anything
about politely

246
00:18:50,829 --> 00:18:52,626
Oh man

247
00:18:58,470 --> 00:18:59,960
How's the clutch, Jose?

248
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:01,672
Tip- top boss man

249
00:19:03,308 --> 00:19:05,003
Almost tip- top

250
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,007
Here, take this will ya?

251
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:10,912
- What's your name again?
- Claire Winslow

252
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:12,072
All right, look Claire

253
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:15,879
l need you to know that
this isn't some Barneys Warehouse sale

254
00:19:16,088 --> 00:19:17,680
Roughly one- quarter
of this country

255
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:20,984
is rebel territory
and expanding rapidly

256
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:23,388
That's almost thirty
thousand square miles of

257
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:24,493
jungles and deserts

258
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:25,890
This isn't a scare tactic
all right?

259
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,396
- lt's a fact
- l appreciate the warning

260
00:19:28,634 --> 00:19:31,432
l just, l need a ride
What's the problem?

261
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:33,937
Come here

262
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:38,835
Come here

263
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,616
ln almost two years

264
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,719
l've gotten maybe a couple
of snippets of rebel action

265
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,719
This story is gonna change
everything for me

266
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:53,323
l am betting
my career on it

267
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:55,925
So there is no way
no matter what

268
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,427
that you will be coming
with me, Princess

269
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:01,092
He's stubborn

270
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,029
How did you
change his mind?

271
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,229
What can l say?
l just.

272
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,566
appealed to the most
noble side of his nature

273
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,266
Five hundred bucks

274
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:21,144
Where's the air- conditioning
in this thing?

275
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,843
Don't touch anything, please

276
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,453
Look for Temeagualpa

277
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,352
- lt's a little village
- Found it

278
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,256
Go three miles
on this road

279
00:20:31,463 --> 00:20:33,954
and then make a left
at the crossing

280
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:36,464
How do you know these
people are in Temagulpa?

281
00:20:36,702 --> 00:20:38,260
The rebels are hiding out
in the jungle

282
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:41,301
Temeagualpa
is a rebel- friendly village

283
00:20:41,506 --> 00:20:42,905
When we get there
we'll find out

284
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,099
where their base camp is

285
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,107
The people are
just gonna tell you?

286
00:20:47,312 --> 00:20:49,906
Just let me worry about that
all right?

287
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,412
Okay

288
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:36,549
l'll be back

289
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,059
Not to fear ladies and gentlemen
Arnets gonna get us through this

290
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,462
He knows how to communicate
with these people

291
00:21:44,703 --> 00:21:46,170
He's a gringos gringo

292
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,404
You know

293
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,324
We gotta find
another way

294
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:13,521
- There is no other way
- l know

295
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:40,852
Hey guys, come here!

296
00:22:49,401 --> 00:22:51,301
The enemy! Lets go!

297
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,844
They've got tanks!

298
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:17,119
Told ya l had a plan!

299
00:23:20,632 --> 00:23:22,031
Lets go!

300
00:23:40,652 --> 00:23:42,745
Yeah, nice plan McClure!

301
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,955
This is where
the fun begins

302
00:23:58,303 --> 00:23:59,361
Jeez!

303
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,736
Showtime amigos!

304
00:24:05,343 --> 00:24:08,039
- We're carrying guns?
- l'll explain later!

305
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,268
Son of a bitch!

306
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:39,973
Shoot! Come on!

307
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:44,881
Put your foot on the gas
Come on!

308
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:46,847
All right now
grab the wheel!

309
00:24:47,052 --> 00:24:50,146
- What are you doing?
- l'm saving your butt, Princess!

310
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:55,854
- Slide it over, will ya?
- Don't yell at me!

311
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,297
Come on Renny
what're you doing?

312
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:05,833
Shoot

313
00:25:06,037 --> 00:25:08,005
No not shoot, shoot!

314
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,074
Careful!

315
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:04,692
Well, that takes care of that

316
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,386
Did you call me
Princess back there?

317
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:08,088
- Yeah, l might've
- What is that supposed to mean?

318
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,790
- Oh just relax, will ya?
- And why are we carrying

319
00:26:10,035 --> 00:26:11,832
- Forget about it
- an arsenal of guns back there?

320
00:26:12,037 --> 00:26:15,006
Well how else am l supposed
to get into rebel territory?

321
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,832
You're supplying
the rebels with guns?

322
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,532
No, l'm supplying them
with toilet paper!

323
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,641
This is so insane

324
00:26:19,844 --> 00:26:22,142
You never said anything
about going into battle!

325
00:26:22,347 --> 00:26:24,645
Relax
We just won the battle!

326
00:26:24,816 --> 00:26:26,408
Oh really?
You think so?

327
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:34,317
- l...l gotta go back
- Yeah go, go, go, go!

328
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,539
Jose, hang in there
You're gonna be fine

329
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:50,240
Tip- top, boss man

331
00:27:09,995 --> 00:27:12,486
Hey, there's
a crossing up ahead!

332
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,494
Dont try to make it past!

333
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:16,997
Get past?
l'll never make it!

334
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:18,896
Train is moving too fast!

335
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,934
The trains going too fast!

336
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:23,232
- lt'll crush us
- Rush?

337
00:27:23,441 --> 00:27:26,239
Oh l'm going
as fast as l can!

338
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:27,843
Dont try!

339
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,445
All right, lll try!

340
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,740
What, is she crazy?

341
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,712
He's crazy!

342
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,234
Stop, stop, stop!

343
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:32,034
- Cuidado!
- Okay

344
00:28:34,245 --> 00:28:37,646
- You really study medicine?
- Yes, please, please hold still

345
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,716
l've studied medicine
for three years now, Jose

346
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:42,318
- You studied on real people?
- Yes

347
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:44,215
Well, kind of, sort of

348
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:46,413
l mean they're dead bodies
They're real people

349
00:28:46,624 --> 00:28:49,115
Were they dead before
or after you practiced on them?

350
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,929
Stop it
Don't be a baby

351
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:56,032
lt's a scratch, Jose

352
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:57,928
l got hit by
a thirty- eight caliber bullet

353
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,501
lt didn't even
hit the bone

354
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,904
Dad would not approve of this one
l'll tell ya that right now

355
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,510
Why?

356
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:11,113
Well because with the tools l have
l- lm afraid its gonna leave a scar

357
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,576
lt'll just add to
my collection

358
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,777
Look, My back

359
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,986
Ouch

360
00:29:20,191 --> 00:29:21,283
What happened?

361
00:29:21,493 --> 00:29:23,688
Government wanted to know
where the rebels were

362
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:24,793
Guess what?

363
00:29:24,996 --> 00:29:28,090
They still wanna know
Sons of bitches

364
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,532

365
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,396
- Gracias
- You're welcome

366
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:38,834
Tip- top boss man

367
00:29:41,746 --> 00:29:43,737
- What are you writing?
- Oh nothing

368
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,516
Oh, Sorry

369
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:52,122
l just...
notes...reporter notes

370
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:58,027
l used to dream of this
when l was a little girl

371
00:29:59,430 --> 00:30:01,830
Campfire
coffee out of tin cups

372
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:06,366
underneath a starry night
lt is so Rio Bravo

373
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:10,769
- You've seen Rio Bravo?
- Oh, like a hundred times

374
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,672
l used to spend my summers
with my grandfather

375
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:17,677
up- he had a ranch up near
Cody, in Wyoming

376
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:18,645
l know where Cody is

377
00:30:18,850 --> 00:30:20,044
Oh, well we used to uh

378
00:30:20,251 --> 00:30:22,242
- we used to horseback ride
- Big rodeo in Cody

379
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:23,249
- And we used to milk
- Fourth of July rodeo

380
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:24,352
- the cattle
- l've been to that rodeo

381
00:30:24,556 --> 00:30:27,252
- and husk corn
- And a bar fight in Cody

382
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,447
Never mind

383
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,558
Well l guess
we'd better get some sleep

384
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:35,064
- Big day tomorrow

385
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,059
Okay

386
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:39,270
All right

387
00:30:43,408 --> 00:30:46,400
You got a choice
You can share my tent or uh

388
00:30:47,812 --> 00:30:49,507
shack up with the boys

389
00:31:00,925 --> 00:31:02,620
We need to push!

390
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:07,930
l said we need to push
That means everybody!

391
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:10,566
l paid for this, remember?

392
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:12,736
You we're the one who told me
that l was a passenger!

393
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:15,667
Yeah l did
Now lm tellin' ya to push!

394
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:18,570
Just pretend you're
what's- her- name in Rio Grande!

395
00:31:18,776 --> 00:31:22,371
She didn't have to push a truck
out of the mud in that movie!

396
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,174
Sure she did
Now push!

397
00:31:26,851 --> 00:31:28,045
Push, push!

398
00:31:30,255 --> 00:31:31,745
Come on, come on!

399
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,502
That evening
we arrived in Temagulpa

400
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:47,898
Temeagualpa

401
00:31:48,106 --> 00:31:48,902
That's what l said

402
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:52,599
lt was completely
destroyed and deserted

403
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:55,005
Christ, these people
stop at nothing

404
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,805
Bastards

405
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:59,882
lt's Rafaels birthplace
He's the rebel leader?

406
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:01,417
They burned it down

407
00:32:06,224 --> 00:32:07,020
By the looks of it

408
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:10,319
we weren't gonna find anything
that would lead us to the rebels

409
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:11,324
All right Renny

410
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:12,427
l need some coverage of this

411
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,325
What d'ya say?
Two wide shots of the street

412
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:17,933
and uh, some close- ups inside
the burned out houses

413
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:35,242
l just saw something
move right there

414
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,442
All right Claire
this might be a trap

415
00:32:36,654 --> 00:32:39,054
So l want you to go around
and stay close to Jose

416
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:40,155
Close

417
00:32:51,002 --> 00:32:53,402
Claire
stay close to the truck

418
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:18,727
What the hell?

419
00:33:24,469 --> 00:33:25,868
Thought l heard something

420
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:22,815

424
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:32,830
There ya go

425
00:34:34,272 --> 00:34:37,469
lt looked like we had found
the only survivor of the raid

426
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:40,874
Hello

427

Where are your friends?

428
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,350
Your parents?

429
00:34:57,562 --> 00:34:59,462
They were taken away

430
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,794
Everyone was taken away?

431
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,597
My brother

432
00:35:17,315 --> 00:35:20,113
Your brother is Rafael?

433
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:24,415
Do you know where he is?

434
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,817
Will you show us?

435
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:28,719
- Press!

436
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:31,326
- Journalist!

438
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,028
Who's the kid?

439
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:55,451
No no no no
Can we cross the bridge?

440
00:35:58,356 --> 00:35:59,653
Jose

441
00:36:00,591 --> 00:36:02,786
He says that the bridge
is solid and strong

442
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,087
and that he's seen
many trucks pass

443
00:36:07,198 --> 00:36:08,495
Come forward

444
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:13,895

Slowly

449
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:12,094
That's fine
You're doing good

460
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:17,490

Jose?

472
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:21,282
Yeah boss?

473
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:23,983
What the hell did
that old shepherd tell you?

474
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,095
Honestly...

475

476
00:39:28,599 --> 00:39:29,395
Well then what about

00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:09,169
Hello Pulitzer Prize

484
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:13,465
Come here Anna

485
00:40:13,677 --> 00:40:14,666
Come on

486
00:40:14,879 --> 00:40:16,369
Renny!

487
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,172
Forget the camera!

488
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,646
l wanna catch this

489
00:41:03,461 --> 00:41:05,588
Anna, come to me, please!

490
00:42:26,176 --> 00:42:28,110
Give me your hand, Anna

491
00:42:28,312 --> 00:42:30,143
Come, come here
Come on, come on

492
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:38,551
Reach up

493
00:42:38,756 --> 00:42:40,451
Reach up...my hand!

494
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:57,002
No! Claire!

495
00:43:03,013 --> 00:43:04,275
Two hundred feet?

496
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:07,376
You fell two hundred feet?

497
00:43:07,718 --> 00:43:08,707
Yes

498
00:43:10,421 --> 00:43:12,514
Maybe it was a hundred

499
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:16,022
l must of washed up
on the bank blacked out

500
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:18,524
And when l opened my eyes

501
00:43:18,729 --> 00:43:21,630
l was met by some
friendly locals

502
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,667
Excuse me

503
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,738
Gringa?

504
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:31,971
They fished me
out of the water

505
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,473
l was so scared

506
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:34,371
l thought

507
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:36,671
they were gonna
have me for breakfast

508
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:38,246
And this one guy

509
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,851
took my wallet

510
00:43:44,154 --> 00:43:46,145
And he wasn't
interested in my money

511
00:43:46,357 --> 00:43:47,654
You know this man?

512
00:43:52,863 --> 00:43:55,661
Will Gallagher is delivering
weapons for you guys?

513
00:43:55,899 --> 00:43:56,866
Yeah

514
00:43:57,101 --> 00:44:00,195
From the government
of the United States of America

515
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:03,634
So, but without a doubt
without a doubt this is the guy?

516
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:08,436
He came with the mercenaries
about a week ago

517
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,546
Son of a bitch

518
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,308
Raffke and Partners
what was that?

519
00:44:13,517 --> 00:44:15,610
Son of a bitch

520
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:18,413
Why are you trying
to find the guy?

521
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:20,317
Well because he said
he was going to Switzerland

522
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:21,923
on business as a lawyer

523
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:24,822
and now he's in Central America
as an arms dealer

524
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:27,119
Son of a bitch

525
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,730
You know you can't
trust a man like that

526
00:44:28,932 --> 00:44:29,728
Wait, wait a minute
wait a minute

527
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:32,026
You said he delivers weapons
for the US government?

528
00:44:32,269 --> 00:44:34,169
But that doesn't make sense

529
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:37,670
No, no, because the government
is for Ramos, not the rebels

530
00:44:37,875 --> 00:44:41,242
- Well, that's politics
- So, so?

531
00:44:41,478 --> 00:44:43,673
So, you are a woman

532
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:47,339
This country definitely
needs a revolution

533
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:49,143
Yes, you're right

534
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:19,605
We headed deeper and deeper
into the jungle

535
00:45:19,817 --> 00:45:22,911
With every step l left
more of my world behind me

536
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:26,214
But l was determined to find Will
l needed answers

537
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:27,617
And a shower

538
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:45,141
There

539
00:46:07,998 --> 00:46:11,399
Welcome to our home!

540
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:20,332
Lets go!

541
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,439
What you see is only
part of our equipment

542
00:46:50,674 --> 00:46:54,371
Half our men in our army
are simply waiting for our signal

543
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:56,273
You see those
ospreys over there?

544
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,472
We got them really cheap
from the United States

545
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:03,781
We found this in the jungle
a couple of nights ago

546
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,684
What about, what about
the driver of this truck?

547
00:47:07,891 --> 00:47:09,586
The driver, he's, he's um

548
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:12,193
he's medium build, medium size
He's American

549
00:47:12,396 --> 00:47:14,591
He has blue eyes
very blue eyes, he's uh

550
00:47:14,798 --> 00:47:18,199
he's, he's kind of a mess
He's kind of- -

551
00:47:18,435 --> 00:47:20,835
What do you mean
lm a, a mess?

552
00:47:28,045 --> 00:47:29,945
l'm so glad you're alive

553
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:33,205
Claire

554
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:36,215
Hi, hi

555
00:47:38,622 --> 00:47:41,614
- l thought l'd lost you guys
- Well not yet anyway

556
00:47:43,527 --> 00:47:46,826
- Did you uh, find him?
- Who?

557
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,123
Will, no, not yet

558
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:59,369
For Renny

559
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:01,407
- You light
- Okay

560
00:48:04,081 --> 00:48:04,877
lt's a tradition

561
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:07,073
to always light a candle
for the dead

562
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:15,089
That was very sweet of you

563
00:48:15,292 --> 00:48:15,883
Claire

564
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,392
Thank god
Long time no see

565
00:48:22,699 --> 00:48:24,633
With your permission, sir

566
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:32,632
So you want to see this
other guy too or, or what?

567
00:48:33,543 --> 00:48:34,840
Yes

568
00:48:35,045 --> 00:48:36,535
Are you gonna take me?

569
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:37,736
Yeah

570
00:48:37,915 --> 00:48:38,711
Yeah, okay

571
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:42,307
l'll see you guys soon

572
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,830
Fixed everything boss man

573
00:48:55,032 --> 00:48:56,226
Tip- top, boss man

574
00:48:58,969 --> 00:48:59,867
See?

575
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:09,405
l'll fix that right away

576
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,018
This wasn't your typical
day in the jungle

577
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:22,385
For a moment

578
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:24,584
l even forgot
about finding Will

579
00:49:24,795 --> 00:49:29,095
l felt like an explorer
discovering this place

580
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,234
the grace of thousand year old temples

581
00:49:32,436 --> 00:49:35,132
lt was like the coolest
theme park ever

582
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:41,742
Okay

583
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:42,741
You stay here

584
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,345
- l'll go get him
- Okay

585
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,727
go kids, go

586
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:16,868
So?

587
00:50:18,148 --> 00:50:19,137
So...

588
00:50:20,450 --> 00:50:22,850
So the bread
is uh, not too old, huh?

589
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:26,545
No uh, not the bread
Uh, Will, where is he?

590
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:29,658
Will, he's uh
he's not here

591
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:31,955
What do you mean
he's not here?

592
00:50:32,162 --> 00:50:33,857
Well he's here
but he's, he's not here

593
00:50:34,064 --> 00:50:37,465
He's uh, in the jungle
with Rafael

594
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:40,160
Be back soon

595
00:50:41,605 --> 00:50:43,004
What's- what's soon?

596
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:46,400
Okay

597
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,908
l go find out
for you now, okay?

598
00:50:49,112 --> 00:50:49,908
No- no- no

599
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:52,308
Never mind, never mind
lt's okay, it's okay

600
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:58,582
So uh, what
is this place anyway?

601
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:00,723
lts called Tauxacapa

602
00:51:00,924 --> 00:51:02,619
He was a great chief

603
00:51:02,826 --> 00:51:07,422
He built this um
how do you...? temple

604
00:51:07,631 --> 00:51:09,326
to worship the sun god

605
00:51:09,533 --> 00:51:13,025
This is the only place
the conquistadors never found

606
00:51:13,270 --> 00:51:17,070
And it is from this place
that we lead our revolution

607
00:51:19,976 --> 00:51:23,070
Almost a quarter
of this country is ours

608
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,372
And its expanding

609
00:51:24,548 --> 00:51:26,243
Thirty thousand

610
00:51:26,450 --> 00:51:28,145
l know, l know

611
00:51:30,554 --> 00:51:31,543
Okay

612
00:51:51,608 --> 00:51:55,408
Hi, oh sorry
Did l wake you?

613
00:51:57,981 --> 00:52:01,212
Next, this piece, watch this
you see?

614
00:52:02,919 --> 00:52:05,217
And the this part, over here

615
00:52:05,422 --> 00:52:07,322
l learned a lot
during the days in the camp

616
00:52:07,524 --> 00:52:09,617
l brushed up on my Spanish

617
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:11,817
l got used to
real spicy food

618
00:52:12,028 --> 00:52:15,020
And l was taught by
highly trained professionals

619
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,269
Finished

620
00:52:26,376 --> 00:52:28,173
What, what about
these pieces here?

621
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:31,445
Those?

622
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:36,315
We don't really need those

623
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:53,464
l've been looking for you
Your boyfriend is here now

624
00:53:06,716 --> 00:53:08,616
Claire? What...

625
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:15,017
l mean all of a sudden
l find out that

626
00:53:15,225 --> 00:53:16,624
my boyfriend
is an arms dealer

627
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,123
l know, sweetheart
listen to me

628
00:53:18,328 --> 00:53:19,818
No don't, don't
sweetheart me, no!

629
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,019
- Listen
- l thought that l knew you

630
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:22,220
You do, you know me

631
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:24,366
lt's, it's still me, just...

632
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:26,627
consider it a job change
Claire...

633
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,269
Consider it a fiance change

634
00:53:32,175 --> 00:53:32,971
- lt's not funny
- No, listen to me

635
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:34,074
- This isn't funny
- lm sorry

636
00:53:34,277 --> 00:53:35,073
l know l should've
told you

637
00:53:35,278 --> 00:53:36,575
- from the beginning, but l...l...
- Yeah

638
00:53:36,780 --> 00:53:39,078
l didnt know what it was
the beginning of l...

639
00:53:39,249 --> 00:53:40,045
- Listen to me l...
- l'm listening

640
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:42,343
l worked behind a desk at first

641
00:53:42,552 --> 00:53:45,953
And, and then things just got
a little bit more involved

642
00:53:46,156 --> 00:53:48,750
- More...
- l flew to Switzerland

643
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,556
l'm sorry, l'm sorry
l uh...

644
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:54,752
l, l've never been
to Switzerland

659
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:45,746
Sir

660
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,041
Without you

661
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:48,740
the revolution
would not happen

662
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:49,850
Gracias

663
00:54:50,954 --> 00:54:53,946
Oh and Rafael is making a speech
You shouldn't miss it, Follow me

664
00:54:56,459 --> 00:55:04,924
Rafael! Rafael!

665
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:21,716
A quarter of this country
is now in rebel territory

666
00:55:21,918 --> 00:55:23,613
And it is expanding

667
00:55:25,221 --> 00:55:28,019
About thirty thousand
square miles of desert

668
00:55:28,224 --> 00:55:29,816
mountains and jungle

669
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:32,724
l hold a letter in my hand

670
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:36,328
a document

671
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:38,330
that will become
part of our history

672
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:40,929
the history

673
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,139
of the overcoming of tyranny

674
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:44,772
in El Coronado!

675
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:49,367
ln this document

676
00:55:49,579 --> 00:55:51,274
the final confirmation

677
00:55:51,448 --> 00:55:52,642
of support

678
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,339
by the government

679
00:55:54,551 --> 00:55:56,451
of the United States of America

680
00:55:56,653 --> 00:55:59,247
Welcome our American friends!

681
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:25,142
This earth is the land

682
00:56:25,315 --> 00:56:27,215
that belonged to our fathers

683
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:30,818
and their fathers
before them

684
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:34,717
This land has been
plundered and raped

685
00:56:34,924 --> 00:56:36,915
by the ones
who took it from us!

686
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:41,524
Off the Western Coast

687
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:43,528
a US freighter
with shipment of arms

688
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:45,166
is waiting for us

689
00:56:46,469 --> 00:56:47,629
Tonight

690
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:50,772
our helicopters will head out
to pick them up

691
00:56:50,974 --> 00:56:52,566
ln two days

692
00:56:52,776 --> 00:56:54,573
we will regain our freedom

693
00:56:56,379 --> 00:56:57,869
ln two days

694
00:56:58,047 --> 00:56:59,981
the sun will rise again

695
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:02,083
over our homeland

696
00:57:03,887 --> 00:57:05,286
ln two days

697
00:57:05,488 --> 00:57:08,480
this land
will be ours again!

698
00:57:08,691 --> 00:57:09,783
All of it!

699
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:17,264
Viva El Coronado!

700
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:22,469
Rafael! Rafael!

701
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:27,132
Viva la revolution!

702
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:46,327
lt's a tough one, huh?

703
00:57:49,532 --> 00:57:50,123
What?

704
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:52,266
You now have

705
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:54,767
three great guys
to choose from

706
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:58,941
Well

707
00:58:00,310 --> 00:58:03,507
Ah...the ring

708
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:05,908
Ah so you've already
made your choice

709
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:08,781
l don't know

710
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:13,983
Well l mean l guess l, l have
to give him a second chance, right?

711
00:58:14,190 --> 00:58:17,785
l didn't come ten thousand miles
just to punch him in the face

712
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,490
Ten thousand miles, thats a

713
00:58:25,735 --> 00:58:28,932
that's a long way
to come to find your man

714
00:58:36,913 --> 00:58:39,609
Television will start
our revolution

715
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:41,010
Tomorrow night

716
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:43,117
a group of ours will have
the national TV station

717
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,617
in San Coronado
in their hands

718
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:46,720
From there

719
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:49,016
we will broadcast
a taped speech

720
00:58:49,225 --> 00:58:51,523
which we will record
in here tonight

721
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,628
With the speech
l will mobilize the people

722
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:58,290
The city has to be boiling
We need chaos, momentum

723
00:58:58,635 --> 00:59:02,002
We fly a massive air raid
on the Presidential Palace at 2300hours

724
00:59:02,338 --> 00:59:04,363
By dawn the city...

725
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:07,506
No

726
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:09,803
The country will be ours

727
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:12,780
l need a volunteer
to deliver the tape

728
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:15,177
to the television station

729
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,374
l'll do it

730
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,988
No uh...
l'll do it

731
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:29,196
We'll just...
we'll do it together

732
00:59:34,137 --> 00:59:37,504
A new day has dawned
for El Coronado

733
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,231
The city is in our hands

734
00:59:40,443 --> 00:59:43,435
This is the beginning
of a new era

735
00:59:54,524 --> 00:59:56,617
- Anna
- What?

736
00:59:56,826 --> 00:59:58,726
l will see you in a little while

737
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,623
Okay

738
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:35,260
There is nobody on the ship!

739
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:36,454
The whole ship!

740
01:00:36,666 --> 01:00:38,361
We searched every corner!

741
01:00:43,006 --> 01:00:44,303
They betrayed us!

742
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:45,474
lts a trap!

743
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,603
They betrayed us!
lts a trap!

744
01:00:49,779 --> 01:00:50,768
lts a trap!

745
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,675
The american betrayed us!

746
01:00:52,882 --> 01:00:54,372
lt's a trap!

747
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,681
lt's full of explosives!

748
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,677
We lost three helicoptors

749
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:02,817
No, we lost three men

750
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:06,411
You have to catch up to them

751
01:02:07,323 --> 01:02:08,915
We shouldnt have
trusted the American

752
01:02:09,125 --> 01:02:12,117
Sancho...leave now

753
01:02:12,328 --> 01:02:14,819
All is not lost yet

754
01:02:35,551 --> 01:02:37,348
Stay inside

755
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:39,653
Okay

756

Fix your door

757
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,211
Hey! Amigo!

758
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:15,320
That's okay, hombre

759
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:18,315
Move over

760
01:03:19,729 --> 01:03:21,424
What are you doing?

761
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:22,825
What are you doing?

762
01:03:25,067 --> 01:03:26,625
Your boyfriend is one of em

763
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:28,666
Soldiers, fire!

765
01:03:31,374 --> 01:03:33,171
- Fuego!

766
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:39,740
Jump!

767
01:03:43,953 --> 01:03:44,942
l hit the ground

768
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:48,351
Pieces of debris
falling left and right

769
01:03:48,558 --> 01:03:50,856
l didn't know if l was
dead or alive

770
01:03:51,060 --> 01:03:52,960
Thank God Arnet did

771
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,356
He gave me the tape

772
01:03:55,565 --> 01:03:57,157
with Rafaels speech

773
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:13,109
Take them away!

774
01:04:19,121 --> 01:04:21,112
Watch her Come!

775
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:32,229
Sit down here!

776
01:04:54,357 --> 01:04:55,654
Viva la revolution

777
01:04:58,661 --> 01:04:59,650
Attencion!

778
01:05:03,900 --> 01:05:04,889
At ease

779
01:05:05,935 --> 01:05:07,732
Pomopoconsita

780
01:05:07,937 --> 01:05:09,336
With your permission

781
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:10,937
The old temple...

782
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,631
they're hiding
behind the waterfall

783
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:16,038
Pomopoconsita!

784
01:05:16,245 --> 01:05:18,338
l knew it!
l knew it!

785
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:22,115
Pomopoconsita

786
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:25,915
Actually it's right here, sir

787
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:29,723
Oh that's Pomopoconsita

788
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:34,325
We are going to crush them
like an eggshell

789
01:05:34,530 --> 01:05:36,521
We are going to
slap their faces...

790
01:05:36,732 --> 01:05:38,666
Mr. President
Mr. President

791
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:41,029
Don't forget
they, they know about me

792
01:05:41,270 --> 01:05:43,568
They know l spied on them

793
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:45,570
lm sure they're aware that
l report to you

794
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:47,367
You mean they know
we're going to attack them?

795
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:49,066
Correct
They know that we know...

796
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:50,370
- What!
- Where they are

797
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:54,243
They know that we know
that they know where we are

798
01:05:54,450 --> 01:05:58,147
So, they know that we know
that they will attack

799
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:01,187
We have to be
one step ahead of them

800
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:02,789
We simply have to be
a step ahead

801
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:05,893
We anticipate their next move

802
01:06:06,095 --> 01:06:08,290
and then we counteract it!

803
01:06:08,497 --> 01:06:11,091
What do they think
we think they think?

804
01:06:11,334 --> 01:06:16,636
What do we think
they think?

805
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:18,807
What is the opposite of that?

806
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:21,032
They expect us
to change our plans

807
01:06:21,243 --> 01:06:24,735
They think
that we are going to attack

808
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:27,815
- But
- But, we dont!

809
01:06:29,518 --> 01:06:31,213
At least it will seem that way

810
01:06:31,420 --> 01:06:32,717
Because we know they know

811
01:06:32,922 --> 01:06:36,221
we think they expect us
to change our plans

812
01:06:37,626 --> 01:06:39,526
We do the opposite

813
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,128
and stick to the plans

814
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:45,926
We catch them when they are
at their most vulnerable

815
01:06:46,168 --> 01:06:47,135
ln the air!

816
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,770
Let his jets leave the city

817
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:51,872
We fly our attack
one hour earlier

818
01:06:52,074 --> 01:06:55,066
We attack in two hours!

819
01:06:55,277 --> 01:06:56,767
With your permission!

820
01:07:00,983 --> 01:07:03,178
Uh, President Ramos

821
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:05,183
l've been meaning to speak
with you about something

822
01:07:05,388 --> 01:07:06,878
Anything, anything

823
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,784
The uh...

824
01:07:10,993 --> 01:07:14,292
CBB reporter has become a...

825
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,488
real threat to you, sir

826
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:19,694
Maybe you should...

827
01:07:21,037 --> 01:07:22,436
make a statement

828
01:07:23,739 --> 01:07:25,138
Make a statement?

829
01:07:26,742 --> 01:07:27,731
Statement

830
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:31,941
Oh...a statement

831
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:35,615
l love you my boy

832
01:07:38,421 --> 01:07:40,116
l know you understand
what l am saying

833
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:42,722
Do you understand me?

834
01:07:42,925 --> 01:07:43,721
She's a tourist

835
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:45,826
She doesn't know
anything about this

836
01:07:47,129 --> 01:07:51,429
Just let her go
Just release her, Jesus

837
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:57,030
What do l...
How much?

838
01:08:00,309 --> 01:08:02,504
What do you have?

839
01:08:03,879 --> 01:08:04,971
What?

840
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:11,085
What did you say?
What'd you say?

841
01:08:11,287 --> 01:08:13,380
How much money do you want?

842
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:15,489
What do you want?
Visas?

843
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,486
Do you have any children?
l can get your family out of here

844
01:08:19,695 --> 01:08:21,492
l can get them to
the United States

845
01:08:29,338 --> 01:08:32,432
l, l don't have a family

846
01:08:33,843 --> 01:08:36,334
And l'm gonna stay here
in Coronado

847
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:39,506
No corruption!

848
01:08:39,715 --> 01:08:43,708
This is a civilized country
you ignorant gringo!

849
01:08:43,919 --> 01:08:46,615
Goddamnit!

850
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:51,716
You and your girlfriend
will end at the pole

851
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:00,325
The tape is in Ramo's hands
And so are the Americans

852
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:03,401
There will be no speech
on television

853
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:10,408
Rafael, without the tape

854
01:09:10,613 --> 01:09:13,207
we won't have the people
out on the streets

855
01:09:13,382 --> 01:09:17,580
You always said the revolution
can't be won without the people

856
01:09:17,786 --> 01:09:18,775
Yes l have

857
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,786
But forging forward is
the only thing we can do now

858
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:27,494
lf you have a better idea
please speak

859
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:02,629
Stay away from window

860
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:37,664
l heard you were
single again

861
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:44,864
How did you, how did you
get through to me?

862
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:47,302
Well it wasn't exactly
a walk in the jungle

863
01:10:50,379 --> 01:10:52,176
Yeah, yeah, yeah, don't worry
we'll lose these guys

864
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:53,473
Turn right!

865
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:15,430
Where's Arnet?

866
01:11:15,671 --> 01:11:17,969
- He's at the Presidential Palace
- Okay

867
01:11:18,173 --> 01:11:20,664
l hear he's going to be
shot at daybreak

868
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:21,774
What?

869
01:11:21,977 --> 01:11:23,376
We have to go get him!

870
01:11:23,579 --> 01:11:25,069
The only thing that's
going to be able to save him

871
01:11:25,247 --> 01:11:26,236
is our revolution

872
01:11:26,448 --> 01:11:27,244
Wait!

873
01:11:27,449 --> 01:11:28,939
- l have it!
- What?

874
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:29,947
The tape

875
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:31,642
- The tape?
- Yes!

876
01:11:31,854 --> 01:11:33,344
- Rafaels speech?
- Yes

877
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:35,455
- l love you!
- lt was Arnet's idea

878
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:37,649
Lets go to the television station!

879
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:41,455
- Go!
- Alright!

880
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:48,363
They are airing the speech

881
01:11:53,609 --> 01:11:56,100
A new day has dawned
for El Coronado

882
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,405
The city is in our hands

883
01:11:58,580 --> 01:12:00,912
This is the beginning
of a new era

884
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:04,315
l call on the people
of San Coronado

885
01:12:04,520 --> 01:12:06,317
Go out into the streets

886
01:12:06,522 --> 01:12:09,013
We are expelling Ramos
out of his palace

887
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:11,021
out of our homeland

888
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:14,127
We shall put an end
to our misery, our poverty

889
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,628
You have to join us
in our revolt

890
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:37,747
This is a new beginning

891
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:40,046
Viva Coronado

892
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:43,554
Viva la tierra
de nuestros padres

893
01:12:43,759 --> 01:12:45,454
Viva la revolucion!

894
01:12:45,661 --> 01:12:49,358
That God damn journalist!

895
01:12:49,565 --> 01:12:51,556
l want him dead!

896
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:55,861
gangster

897
01:12:56,105 --> 01:12:57,800
parasite

898
01:12:58,006 --> 01:13:00,770
weed, noxious animal, bastard

899
01:13:14,223 --> 01:13:16,623
l could run faster than this

900
01:13:16,825 --> 01:13:18,622
Yeah but you wouldn't
get very far

901
01:13:18,827 --> 01:13:30,796
Rafael! Rafael!

902
01:15:06,535 --> 01:15:08,594
No need to be scared now

903
01:15:10,239 --> 01:15:12,639
We're gonna be
too late for Arnet

904
01:15:12,841 --> 01:15:14,638
We're gonna be
too late for ourselves

905
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:16,538
ls there any other way in?

906
01:15:16,745 --> 01:15:18,042
l'd have to make a way

907
01:15:18,213 --> 01:15:19,305
How? How?

908
01:15:34,930 --> 01:15:36,124
That's how

909
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:37,414
Execution square's this way

910
01:17:20,235 --> 01:17:22,533
Marktime, march!

911
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:26,439
Right face!

912
01:17:47,329 --> 01:17:55,031
Here they are!
Hold your fire, cease fire!

913
01:18:03,111 --> 01:18:06,103
Mr President
this way, this way

914
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:10,274
- lt's Will and the president
- Yeah, l know

915
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:12,282
- We can't let them get away
- Okay

916
01:18:12,487 --> 01:18:13,579
- Let's split up
- Okay

917
01:18:13,789 --> 01:18:15,484
You go after the man
that you like

918
01:18:15,691 --> 01:18:17,090
and l go after the man
that l don't like

919
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:19,886
- Okay?
- Go, no, go

920
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:21,494
Get ready!

921
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:32,706
Aim!

922
01:18:48,223 --> 01:18:50,316
Viva la revolucion!

923
01:19:27,395 --> 01:19:29,386
Watch out! To the right!

924
01:19:48,316 --> 01:19:49,214
Jose

925
01:19:58,126 --> 01:19:59,024
Tip- top

926
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:03,820
Tip- top

927
01:20:07,169 --> 01:20:08,727
Fly the helicopter!

928
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:11,165
What did l put you
through the school for?

929
01:21:15,670 --> 01:21:17,365
Think we can
make a run for it?

930
01:21:24,045 --> 01:21:25,034
Hello!

931
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:28,043
Anybody?

932
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,047
Look, l could use a hand here

933
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:34,248
Hello?

934
01:21:34,456 --> 01:21:35,548
Who is that?

935
01:21:38,260 --> 01:21:39,249
Hello?

936
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:03,307
Coronado, viva!

937
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:30,874
Very entertaining

938
01:22:31,046 --> 01:22:33,139
Happy ending, huh?

939
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:34,645
But l don't think so

940
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:39,045
- l don't buy your story
- l thought it was good

941
01:22:40,455 --> 01:22:42,548
lt's not possible

942
01:22:42,757 --> 01:22:46,557
A girl from Beverly Hills saves
a revolution in Central America?

943
01:22:46,761 --> 01:22:48,752
- No
- No

944
01:22:52,100 --> 01:22:53,567
Well gentlemen

945
01:22:53,802 --> 01:22:55,360
l have to go

946
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:57,298
l think they're
ready out there

947
01:22:57,505 --> 01:22:59,905
lt was really nice
talking to you

948
01:23:00,942 --> 01:23:02,341
Bye guys

949
01:23:02,544 --> 01:23:03,533
Bye

950
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:09,909
Tip- top boss man
Fixed everything

951
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:12,814
What were you talking to
those guys about for so long?

952
01:23:13,021 --> 01:23:14,318
They wanted to hear my story

953
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:17,013
What, your story?
Hah, You're a tourist

954
01:23:17,225 --> 01:23:18,624
l am not a tourist

955
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,419
Oh, you paid for the trip
didn't ya?

956
01:23:20,628 --> 01:23:22,721
Well, that was
out of pure courtesy

957
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:23,829
Five hundred bucks

958
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,727
- You would've done it for free
- You didn't even bargain

959
01:23:25,967 --> 01:23:27,525
- Girl before was two- fifty
- You were desperate

960
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:29,430
- She wasn't even cute
- l knew that at the very beginning

961
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,231
Besides, would a tourist
save a reporter's life?

962
01:23:32,474 --> 01:23:33,873
You didn't save my life

963
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:35,269
- Oh, l didn't?
- No

964
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:37,877
They just didn't get around
to shooting me in time

965
01:23:39,247 --> 01:23:41,147
Oh, Jose!

966
01:23:42,751 --> 01:23:44,048
Sorry boss

967
01:23:44,252 --> 01:23:45,651
l'll fix that right away
