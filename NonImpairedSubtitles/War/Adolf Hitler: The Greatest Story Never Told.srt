1
00:00:18,335 --> 00:00:20,425
"The victor will never be asked
if he told truth"

2
00:00:20,865 --> 00:00:21,705
Adolf Hitler

3
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,620
Since the mid-20th century,

4
00:00:31,053 --> 00:00:32,292
the world has ever heard of
an incredible story,

5
00:00:32,789 --> 00:00:34,045
the story of a boy from an ordinary
family whose ambition it was

6
00:00:34,404 --> 00:00:35,955
to became an artist, but who
instead became a drifter.

7
00:00:47,854 --> 00:00:49,773
His destiny however was not to drift
into the awaiting oblivion,

8
00:00:50,142 --> 00:00:51,884
but to rise to the greaest heights
of power, eventually to become

9
00:00:52,292 --> 00:00:54,223
one of the most influential men
who ever lived.

10
00:01:03,127 --> 00:01:05,438
Now for the first time, here is
the true and fctual account

11
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:07,839
of a story many believe to be...

12
00:01:08,377 --> 00:01:10,581
The Greatest Story NEVER Told!

13
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:23,470
The Untold Story of Adolf Hitler

14
00:01:40,330 --> 00:01:44,078
ADOLF HITLER
THE GREATEST STORY NEVER TOLD!

15
00:01:48,075 --> 00:01:49,878
April 20, 1889
Braunau am Inn, Austria

16
00:01:49,913 --> 00:01:52,024
The story began here in the
Austrian town of Braunau,

17
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:55,416
with a child born in
this house, Adolf Hitler.

18
00:01:56,351 --> 00:01:59,155
At his peak, the most
popular ruler in Europe.

19
00:01:59,993 --> 00:02:01,529
The child born here in Braunau,

20
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:04,383
belonged to that handful of human
beings,

21
00:02:04,727 --> 00:02:06,403
who have clearly and decisively

22
00:02:06,932 --> 00:02:10,088
changed the history of the 20th
century.

23
00:02:10,123 --> 00:02:13,943
Linz, Austria, the site of the
only memorial to the Hitler family.

24
00:02:13,978 --> 00:02:15,866
The grave of Hitler's parents.

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,269
Nothing about his
parents or Adolf's early life,

26
00:02:21,304 --> 00:02:25,147
gave any hint of the extra
ordinary career that was to come.

27
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,506
His father Alois

28
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,056
was a stern short tempered
custom's official

29
00:02:34,512 --> 00:02:35,393
who beat his son.

30
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,432
His mother Klara
tried to protect him.

31
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,800
When she died young
Adolf was broken by grief.

32
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,334
He kept her portrait with
him for the rest of his life.

33
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,600
The infant Adolf was baptized
and brought up as a Catholic.

34
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:56,400
At the age of 6 he entered the
monastery school at Lambach.

35
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,400
Soon he was top of his class.

36
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:04,800
Hitler was a chorister at the
Great Abby Church of Lumbach.

37
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,854
I used he said,

38
00:03:06,267 --> 00:03:09,959
"to intoxicate myself with the solemn
splendor of the services."

39
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:20,400
Every day when he sang in the choir,
he saw the memorial to an earlier abbot.

40
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:23,097
Above it was an emblem,
which a quarter of a century later,

41
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:27,104
Hitler was to adopt for the
Nazi Party, the Swastika.

42
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,000
In his teens Hitler became
a moody adolescent.

43
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,360
At secondary school in Linz,

44
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:39,877
he lost interest in most of
his work.

45
00:03:40,494 --> 00:03:44,725
His ambition was to go to Vienna
and become an Artist or Architect.

46
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,605
Once there he produced architectural
drawings and water colors like these.

47
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,669
Competent, but not good enough
to win the place he longed for

48
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,900
at the Viennese Academy Of Fine Arts.

49
00:04:07,703 --> 00:04:09,496
Vienna, Austria

50
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:18,050
Little by little all Hitlers early
ambitions in Vienna turned sour.

51
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:20,150
After the shock of
being turned down twice

52
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,450
by the Academy of Fine Arts,
he became a drifter.

53
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:29,150
Hitler later called his period in Vienna
the most miserable time of my life.

54
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:31,350
Vienna 1913
Three of those miserable years,

55
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:33,604
were spent here in a Viennese
back street

56
00:04:34,022 --> 00:04:35,822
at this hostile for homeless men.

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,850
In this depressing hostile, the future
Führer passed much of the day

58
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:47,800
sitting with other inmates churning
out drawings of water colors

59
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,650
which earned him
a modest income.

60
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:52,882
When he drifted from
Vienna to Germany in 1913,

61
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:56,930
he was still dreaming of becoming
a great Artist or famous Architect.

62
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:04,850
Munich, the first of August 1914.

63
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:08,347
A cheering crowd welcomes the
outbreak of the First World War.

64
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,259
On the right is a photographer,

65
00:05:18,804 --> 00:05:20,572
and among the crowd he's
photographing,

66
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,250
is the 25 year old Adolf Hitler.

67
00:05:28,647 --> 00:05:30,510
Adolf Hitler - THE WAR HERO

68
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:39,600
If you look at the tenacity of his
service, I mean he's a fanatic.

69
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,400
And he petitioned King
Ludwig III of Bavaria,

70
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:48,600
to enlist in what is referred to
as the King's own regiment.

71
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,300
That's an elite Bavarian unit.

72
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,200
He was accepted, but put in the
16th Bavarian reserve infantry.

73
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:01,550
And World War One is a
major influence on Hitler's life.

74
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,800
Now he served his basic
training without complaining.

75
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,700
But he was always willing to
offer his fellow comrades help.

76
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:15,000
He spoke about the evil of tobacco
and alcohol to his fellow soldiers,

77
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,800
and they liked him because of
his drawings that he did for them.

78
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,900
He would do
sketches for them.

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,400
Remember he sketched and did a
variety of things you know in his youth,

80
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:28,700
as he was trying to
get into Art school.

81
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,300
So he really got along
with his fellow soldiers.

82
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,200
At one point during the trench
duties, in between 1914- 1918,

83
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,700
he will have a dog, somebody
going to steal from him.

84
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,200
During World War
One Adolf Hitler

85
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:49,000
repeatedly, repeatedly
volunteered for hazardous duty.

86
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:53,700
His first combat was
October the 29th, 1914.

87
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,409
Hitler's unit lost 3.000 of its
3.600 men,

88
00:06:59,714 --> 00:07:02,895
after making 5 assaults on the
enemy position.

89
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,185
Now Hitler had one
of his sleeves shot off.

90
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,900
He walked out of a tent where
he'd been talking with some men,

91
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,530
and a couple of seconds later a shell
hits and blows it to kingdom come.

92
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,538
And for his
fighting in this unit,

93
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,312
he was awarded the Iron Cross, 2nd
Class for Bravery, Bravery Under Fire.

94
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,300
And he was
promoted to Corporal.

95
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,800
So this is a well
deserved award.

96
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:30,676
Later, he became a runner,

97
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:34,366
which meant he moved messages
from the rear to the front,

98
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,600
and it's a very
high mortality job.

99
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,222
And he liked it, he
always liked that job.

100
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Then in December, of 1914, when
you have the famous Christmas truce,

101
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:51,685
on December the 25th, Hitler
wouldn't leave his trench.

102
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:56,594
And his comment was, "such a
thing should not happen in War time".

103
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,309
Then he told his buddies

104
00:07:59,277 --> 00:08:02,307
that participated, that they were
wrong to get involved.

105
00:08:02,709 --> 00:08:07,348
So no fun, while the war goes
on, those are your enemies.

106
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:16,193
Now between 1914- 1916, in the final
stages of the Battle Of The Somme,

107
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:20,600
Adolf Hitler was wounded in
the leg by a shell fragment.

108
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,968
This sent him back to
Germany to recover.

109
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,060
And he's there for about 5 months.

110
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,994
Hitler could have stayed back
in Germany, on light duty

111
00:08:32,776 --> 00:08:33,840
because of his wound,

112
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,000
but demanded to be
sent back to the front.

113
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,503
So this...
he's no shirker.

114
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:42,992
You've got to give the guy some
due here for not being a chicken.

115
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,245
A lot of people, you know, look
for a way to get out of there.

116
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,293
Then you have Hitler
back again on trench duty,

117
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,508
and then he shows up again during
the of course German offensives.

118
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,692
Now, during the
Ludendorff offensives,

119
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,265
he was armed with a pistol and
he captured five French soldiers.

120
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,413
And for that he received
the Iron Cross 1st Class.

121
00:09:05,513 --> 00:09:09,126
You didn't get those at any
time in the war for free.

122
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,165
You can't dismiss
his decorations.

123
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:16,089
He wins the Iron Cross 2nd
Class in 1914, 1st Class in 1918,

124
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:20,878
and then in mid October he got
another battle field decoration.

125
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,926
But he's never promoted because he
had a Captain, Captain Fritz Wiedemann,

126
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,358
said he lacked the
capacity for leadership.

127
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,467
You just can't make
these statements.

128
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:38,606
As the war turned against Germany,
he believed that the pacifists

129
00:09:38,641 --> 00:09:41,113
and the shirkers, which were people
trying to get out of duty,

130
00:09:42,066 --> 00:09:43,712
were losing the war.

131
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:47,189
And the thing that enraged
him even worse is what is

132
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:49,930
referred to as "defeatism" in the ranks.

133
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:56,276
They're actually non-commissioned officers,
who said it was stupid to keep fighting.

134
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,172
He beat one up.

135
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:02,866
So we have a Corporal beating
up a non-commissioned officer,

136
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,407
and he doesn't get into
trouble for it. He's a fanatic.

137
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:13,198
The end of the war Hitler was gassed by
the British forces advancing their Ypres

138
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,662
in mid October 1918.

139
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,996
It bloated his face up,
in particular his eyelids.

140
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:23,006
Constantly watering eyes,
had a hoarse voice.

141
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:31,966
He then had this terrible pain, he referred
to it "piercing pain in my eye socket".

142
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:36,374
He hated leaving the
front to go to the hospital.

143
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,978
He considered it the
happiest chapter in his life.

144
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,410
Being there, being something,
being with people,

145
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,413
you know he had friends, and he had
comrades while he was in the war.

146
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,429
He was not a loner.

147
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:50,835
He had the respect of
his fellow soldiers.

148
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,588
He had purpose.

149
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:58,664
By early November Hitler's spirits
had come back, and it's very common

150
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,795
for people who had been
gassed to plunge into depression,

151
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,200
because they're concerned about
being blind the rest of their lives.

152
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:09,278
On November the 9th, this is
two days before the Armistice,

153
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,867
a local Pastor came to the hospital

154
00:11:12,603 --> 00:11:14,724
and told the patients that
on November the 8th,

155
00:11:15,114 --> 00:11:19,099
that the Kaiser had abdicated,
and Germany was now a Republic.

156
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,196
And he told them
that the war was lost.

157
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,877
Defeat was followed by a
humiliating peace at Versailles.

158
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,261
The injustice of Versailles rankled with
most Germans for the next 20 years.

159
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,929
Unable to accept that the
German army had lost the war,

160
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,564
Hitler convinced himself that the
soldiers had been stabbed in the back

161
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,100
by Communist revolutionaries
and parliamentary Politicians.

162
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:49,573
The stab in the back he believed was
part of a great Jewish conspiracy.

163
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:54,055
Suddenly Hitler discovered the greatest
talent he possessed,

164
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,007
the gift of public speaking.

165
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:05,924
He joined the small group of
fanatical Nationalists in Munich.

166
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:10,465
They became the National Socialist
German Workers Party, or Nazis.

167
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,761
In 1921, Hitler
became their leader.

168
00:12:16,301 --> 00:12:17,895
Munich 1921

169
00:12:23,614 --> 00:12:25,790
The word "Nazi" was used by the Allies
as a derogaory term,

170
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:28,159
popularised by the international media
for propaganda purposes.

171
00:12:28,564 --> 00:12:29,486
After World War One,

172
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:31,476
Germany was in serious danger of
a Communist takeover,

173
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:33,834
with 6 million German Communist Party
members in the country.

174
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,907
Adolf Hitler was only the 55th member
of the NSDAP, and although membership

175
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,744
rapidly grew under his leadership,
the early meetings

176
00:12:39,163 --> 00:12:40,884
were often held under
threats of violence.

177
00:12:41,788 --> 00:12:43,744
Vastly outnumbered, the National
Sociolist would often find

178
00:12:44,216 --> 00:12:46,232
their meetings infiltrated, where
brawls would inevitably break out.

179
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:54,700
The first film of the apprentice
Führer campaigning

180
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,200
shows him as still a
rather awkward figure.

181
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,000
Not yet certain of his roll
as Germany's Messiah.

182
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:05,000
In 1923, Hitler felt strong enough
to try and seize power in Munich.

183
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:10,000
Emil Klein, the only stormtrooper
still alive who marched with Hitler,

184
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,200
now retraces their steps.

185
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,700
Everything went well

186
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,338
until the marchers found armed Police
blocking their exit from a narrow street.

187
00:13:23,265 --> 00:13:29,300
"We were still singing as
we marched down the street.

188
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,200
Suddenly, we heard shots
being fired all around us.

189
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:35,507
Procession started.

190
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,200
We were speechless, we
couldn't explain what had happened,

191
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:46,400
until word came from the front of
the march saying Hitler was dead.

192
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,800
I saw men with
tears in their eyes,

193
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,294
and I myself was very moved to,

194
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:57,429
and had great difficulty keeping
myself under control.

195
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:01,100
Though Hitler in fact
survived the hail of bullets,

196
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:04,600
he was arrested and locked
in a cell in Landsberg prison.

197
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,085
At first he was so depressed,
he refused to eat.

198
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,600
Then his confidence returned,

199
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:13,069
as he discovered that the failed
uprising had made him a local hero.

200
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,542
At the trial Hitler
rounded on his accusers.

201
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,401
He told the Judges, who
gave him a prison sentence,

202
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:23,218
"history will tear to tatters
the verdict of this court!"

203
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:32,227
You have been accused of 'High Treason'
and called 'An Enemy Of The State'!

204
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,132
"If I am guilty of anything,

205
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,817
then I am guilty of fighting to defend
the rights to the German people."

206
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,148
Herr Hitler, the court
finds you Guilty of Treason.

207
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:52,667
You are hereby sentenced
to a fine of 200 Gold Marks,

208
00:14:53,900 --> 00:14:57,182
and 5 years in Landsberg prison.

209
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:06,855
You will... you will be eligible
for parole in 9 months.

210
00:15:08,022 --> 00:15:10,830
Adolf Hitler will serve next
12 moths in Landsberg prison

211
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,278
To be continued

212
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:23,074
Part 2
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

213
00:15:26,154 --> 00:15:28,165
After the propaganda
triumph at his trial,

214
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:31,181
Hitler set out to write the
Bible of National Socialism.

215
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:34,031
He dictated much of the text here

216
00:15:34,407 --> 00:15:36,375
in his cell to his faithful follower,
Rudolph Hoess.

217
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:38,877
On Saturday evenings, the
other prisoners sat around

218
00:15:39,287 --> 00:15:42,796
as Hitler read out the
completed chapters to them.

219
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:46,782
The book as a whole, dwells on the great
obsessions which had come to dominate

220
00:15:47,220 --> 00:15:51,621
Hitler's political thought; the Jews, racism,
living space for the German people,

221
00:15:52,172 --> 00:15:54,605
the evils of communism and
parliamentary democracy.

222
00:15:55,469 --> 00:15:58,086
But it also includes
Hitler's views on a variety

223
00:15:58,535 --> 00:16:01,902
of other topics ranging
from boxing to syphilis.

224
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,814
Mein kampf

225
00:16:04,855 --> 00:16:06,493
Mein Kampf will become one of the
best-selling books of al time,

226
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:08,619
despite being banned in many
countriesfter the war.

227
00:16:13,382 --> 00:16:16,231
The amasing apeal, Hitler was
lated to exercise

228
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:19,145
but he is mastering a spoken word.

229
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:22,842
After prison, the Leader, or Führer
as he now called himself,

230
00:16:23,427 --> 00:16:25,056
had a new political strategy.

231
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:29,587
Instead of planning another coup,
he aimed to win power at the polls.

232
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,195
What was to win him millions
of votes, was instead,

233
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:35,526
his vision of a great national revival.

234
00:16:39,202 --> 00:16:42,951
Hitler's election opportunity came
with the onset of the depression.

235
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:46,761
In a few years, 1 in 3 of the
labor force was out of work.

236
00:16:46,903 --> 00:16:50,286
Ilsa Vemple, was a church social
worker during the depression

237
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:52,907
among the unemployed
in the Berlin slums.

238
00:16:52,942 --> 00:16:58,211
"The despair was so
terrible as I can't describe it.

239
00:16:58,304 --> 00:17:02,834
You had everywhere beggars, wherever
you went in Berlin, you had beggars."

240
00:17:03,205 --> 00:17:06,234
The democratic political
parties offered no solution.

241
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:10,052
To millions of Germans, the
only hope was Adolf Hitler.

242
00:17:12,306 --> 00:17:14,252
Have you been to
the marketplace?

243
00:17:15,707 --> 00:17:18,375
Do you know how much it costs
for a loaf of bread these days?

244
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:20,951
$500.000 marks.

245
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,095
$500.000 marks!

246
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,597
The wheelbarrows aren't big
enough to carry the money in!

247
00:17:29,408 --> 00:17:31,628
He's afraid I'll stir things up.

248
00:17:33,209 --> 00:17:37,860
You tell Commissar Kahr,
this is not a time for silence.

249
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:41,591
"I supported Hitler because he,

250
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:46,204
after having seen all that depravity,
all that poverty here,

251
00:17:46,411 --> 00:17:50,861
was the only one who could do
social justice to the people here."

252
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:55,612
"He had that ability,

253
00:17:55,712 --> 00:18:00,827
the ability derived from his
readiness

254
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:03,979
to throw himself totally open

255
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:10,326
to... to appear as it were,
bare and naked before his audience,

256
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:13,982
to tear open his heart

257
00:18:14,017 --> 00:18:20,013
and display it, to throw
on a few extra generators

258
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:23,901
and suddenly become
absolutely charged with energy."

259
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:26,821
Presidential Elections
26 April 1925

260
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:28,422
Nur
Paul von Hindenburg

261
00:18:33,957 --> 00:18:35,703
Reichstag, Berlin
Nazi Party: 3 seats

262
00:18:35,738 --> 00:18:36,870
April 1925

263
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:42,820
Election Campaign

264
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:45,389
It wasn't as though
he was using words,

265
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:48,787
it's as though the emotions
came direct without words almost.

266
00:18:49,499 --> 00:18:51,580
There was a rawness
about Hitler's power.

267
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:54,303
Reichstag Election
Nazi Party: 107 seats

268
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:03,022
Six and a half Million
votes. 107 seats.

269
00:19:03,122 --> 00:19:04,745
The biggest party
in the Reichstag.

270
00:19:05,322 --> 00:19:06,775
Get me Hitler.

271
00:19:09,502 --> 00:19:11,692
Reich Chancellary, Berlin
30 September 1933

272
00:19:27,226 --> 00:19:31,326
Nobody has ever had this
power to move audiences so easily.

273
00:19:31,426 --> 00:19:34,026
What he says...
it's the way he says it!

274
00:19:39,927 --> 00:19:41,477
Hitler comes to power,

275
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:44,520
not as he had hoped through
outright victory at the polls,

276
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:46,767
but as head of a
coalition government.

277
00:19:46,828 --> 00:19:51,698
As this withering glance suggests,
Hitler despises his coalition partners.

278
00:19:51,929 --> 00:19:56,830
He quickly out maneuvers them,
and establishes his own dictatorship.

279
00:19:58,129 --> 00:20:00,330
A month after he
comes to power,

280
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:04,031
the Reichstag building, the parliament
building, in Berlin is set on fire.

281
00:20:04,131 --> 00:20:05,265
This happens to come
The Reichstag Fire 1933

282
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:08,337
at the time when he is constantly
insisting

283
00:20:08,683 --> 00:20:09,904
that there is a communist plot

284
00:20:10,495 --> 00:20:14,022
to overthrow the new government,
and to scary out a revolution.

285
00:20:14,231 --> 00:20:17,360
And the Reichstag fire goes up
in flames which everybody can see.

286
00:20:18,032 --> 00:20:19,524
Before that night was over,

287
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:23,404
he had got a set of decrees
drawn up,

288
00:20:23,533 --> 00:20:25,760
which transformed
the situation politically.

289
00:20:26,083 --> 00:20:29,228
All the guarantees, in which
people in any democratic state,

290
00:20:29,623 --> 00:20:30,803
the freedom of speech and so on,

291
00:20:31,118 --> 00:20:33,309
freedom from arrest, all of this
is swept away.

292
00:20:44,582 --> 00:20:45,994
In the 1920s, Berlin was known as
the center of sexual perversion,

293
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:47,755
drugs and depravity.

294
00:20:48,219 --> 00:20:50,814
Once in power Hitler ordered the sity
ceansed of these elements.

295
00:20:51,275 --> 00:20:52,072
Obscene books, pornography
and Communist literature

296
00:20:52,457 --> 00:20:54,467
were all burned by the National
Socialist.

297
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,847
The clampdown will fore Jews,
promiscuous liberals and gays such as

298
00:20:59,265 --> 00:21:02,215
Marlene Dietrich - a known bisexual -
to leave for the US.

299
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,185
1933 BERLIN

300
00:21:14,641 --> 00:21:15,600
The burning of pornography
and Communist literature

301
00:21:15,635 --> 00:21:18,346
A majority of Germans tolerate
the burning of books,

302
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:20,335
the banning of other political parties,

303
00:21:20,902 --> 00:21:22,293
and the setting up of a police state,

304
00:21:22,895 --> 00:21:25,206
because Hitler offers a way out
of the depression.

305
00:21:26,842 --> 00:21:30,243
If he's doing things which are
not so good, which happened,

306
00:21:30,343 --> 00:21:34,443
then we said, "well, you have to
take the rough with the smooth."

307
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:38,068
Dictatorship seemed to be the
only way to get out of the mess,

308
00:21:38,644 --> 00:21:41,382
and so, I thought that was
a good thing

309
00:21:41,726 --> 00:21:44,340
that they cut away all this
nonsense and rather

310
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:48,739
did something, really did
something, and that's what Hitler did.

311
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:57,069
He eliminated the crushing
unemployment that Germany suffered.

312
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:04,837
And he gave millions of people
new confidence, and indeed, welfare.

313
00:22:05,048 --> 00:22:09,048
They were doing better;
much better.

314
00:22:19,322 --> 00:22:20,792
When Hitler assumed power
in 1933,

315
00:22:21,265 --> 00:22:22,809
there were 7 million unemployed
Germans,

316
00:22:23,309 --> 00:22:25,302
the highest per capita unemployment
rate in Europe, at the time.

317
00:22:25,923 --> 00:22:26,722
In only is first year in office,

318
00:22:27,148 --> 00:22:29,373
an unprecedented 3.374.000
were helped back to work.

319
00:22:30,723 --> 00:22:32,923
Hitler's brilliant and innovative ideas
included building motorways

320
00:22:33,258 --> 00:22:36,315
the lenght and breadth of the country,
with housing units provided for workers.

321
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:39,337
The worker's familes would then eagerly
spend the newly earned wages,

322
00:22:39,338 --> 00:22:41,307
contributing to a fast-growing
economy.

323
00:22:42,835 --> 00:22:44,463
Priority was given to the health
and fitness of the nation,

324
00:22:44,818 --> 00:22:46,302
especialy for the youth.

325
00:22:46,337 --> 00:22:49,072
Free healthcare and generous financial
support were provided for expectant mothers.

326
00:22:49,605 --> 00:22:54,425
The world's first anti-smoking
campaigns are also introduced.

327
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:54,962
In addition, it was now government
policy

328
00:22:55,404 --> 00:22:57,205
to protect the environment
and wildlife.

329
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:10,893
Crime was virtually eliminated,

330
00:23:11,316 --> 00:23:12,552
with city streets made safe
to walk again.

331
00:23:12,587 --> 00:23:14,760
Workers, subsidised by the government,
would take holidays abroad.

332
00:23:15,445 --> 00:23:17,229
Hitler is the first in Europe to
introduce the 40-hour work week,

333
00:23:17,772 --> 00:23:18,971
with extra pay for overtime.

334
00:23:19,451 --> 00:23:22,268
Factories are now required to provide
workers with restrooms and a cafeteria.

335
00:23:23,076 --> 00:23:25,671
The NSDAP leadership looked upon
the charging of interest on loans as immoral,

336
00:23:26,143 --> 00:23:27,948
and by forsing banks to abolish
the practice of usury,

337
00:23:28,388 --> 00:23:30,164
millions were freed from slavery
of debt.

338
00:23:31,642 --> 00:23:33,674
It was a spectacular financial recovery
not witnessed before or since,

339
00:23:34,257 --> 00:23:36,394
and often reffered to as the
greatest economic miracle of all time.

340
00:23:37,553 --> 00:23:40,322
Meanwhile, most Western countries were
still mired in the Great Depression.

341
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:55,808
THE NUREMBERG RALLIES
The annual celebration of Nacional Socialism

342
00:24:01,264 --> 00:24:03,517
They came in the tens of thousands,

343
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,638
full of youthful idealism to worship
the Führer,

344
00:24:06,865 --> 00:24:09,232
the awesome surroundings
of the Nuremberg stadium.

345
00:24:09,465 --> 00:24:11,562
Among the worshipers in the
Hitler Youth

346
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:14,974
was Alfons Heck, now a writer
of the Nazi period.

347
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:26,268
The decisive turning point in my
life occurred at the age of ten.

348
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:30,395
From that moment on, I would
remain beholden to Adolf Hitler,

349
00:24:30,768 --> 00:24:33,547
long until after our defeat.

350
00:24:33,969 --> 00:24:39,473
I was one of 82.000 members of the
Hitler Youth lined up in Zeppelin's Field.

351
00:24:39,669 --> 00:24:40,864
I stood in the first row.

352
00:24:42,069 --> 00:24:43,662
And when Hitler began to speak,

353
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:48,325
we were just tingling with nervousness,
filing to see our God.

354
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:51,371
Then he appeared
on the podium.

355
00:24:51,471 --> 00:24:53,271
I was afraid to
look at my neighbor,

356
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:56,471
because I didn't want him
to see the tears in my eyes,

357
00:24:56,571 --> 00:24:57,872
my knees were shaking.

358
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:00,174
Then Hitler beamed down on us,

359
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:03,396
he calmed us down by lifting
his hands,

360
00:25:03,472 --> 00:25:04,996
both hands several times.

361
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:09,474
When he began to speak it was
in a very conversational tone,

362
00:25:09,574 --> 00:25:12,374
man to boy, father to son.

363
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:35,977
Then he said how fortunate
we were to live in this new age.

364
00:25:36,178 --> 00:25:38,365
And he said from now on you,

365
00:25:39,506 --> 00:25:43,167
no longer have to fear any class
distinction, you're all one.

366
00:25:43,579 --> 00:25:47,879
But the essence, and the emphasis
occurred in the final sentences.

367
00:25:47,979 --> 00:25:49,212
He leaned over the podium,

368
00:25:50,313 --> 00:25:52,424
and I know he looked straight
into my eyes.

369
00:25:52,880 --> 00:26:00,343
And he said, "You, my boys, the
young of Germany,

370
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,352
live in a fortunate time,

371
00:26:03,781 --> 00:26:08,177
because you are the standard
bearers of the movement.

372
00:26:08,582 --> 00:26:14,095
You will inherit what we
have so far created."

373
00:26:14,283 --> 00:26:17,110
And from that moment on,
without any doubt,

374
00:26:17,838 --> 00:26:19,293
I was bound to Adolf Hitler.

375
00:26:20,084 --> 00:26:22,683
Long until after our defeat.

376
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,113
Before us lies Germany

377
00:26:25,442 --> 00:26:29,390
within us Germany is stirring

378
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:31,818
behind us all Germany is following!

379
00:26:50,288 --> 00:26:54,188
The mid 1930s were the
halcyon years of Hitler's Germany.

380
00:26:54,288 --> 00:26:59,389
Germany was at peace, her prosperity
restored, her national pride recovered.

381
00:26:59,489 --> 00:27:02,618
To those prepared to ignore or justify,
the police state,

382
00:27:03,258 --> 00:27:04,771
it seemed a beautiful Germany.

383
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:08,518
A host of distinguished foreign visitors,

384
00:27:09,089 --> 00:27:11,314
many with impeccable democratic
credentials,

385
00:27:11,791 --> 00:27:15,336
came to call on the Führer at
his mountain retreat, the Berghof.

386
00:27:15,992 --> 00:27:20,992
Among them, was the former British
Prime Minister, David Lloyd George.

387
00:27:21,192 --> 00:27:24,525
With LG, was his
secretary Albert Sylvester.

388
00:27:24,891 --> 00:27:25,682
BERCHTESGADEN
4t SEPTEMBER 1936

389
00:27:25,693 --> 00:27:29,093
Hitler run down
the flight of stairs

390
00:27:29,193 --> 00:27:32,594
to welcome LG as
he got out of his car.

391
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:35,454
Shook hands with him most warmly,

392
00:27:35,836 --> 00:27:39,315
and conducted us into the inside
of the Berghof.

393
00:27:39,894 --> 00:27:44,596
This massive room, the
only light of which came

394
00:27:44,696 --> 00:27:49,140
from a massive window, which was
terrific, I'd never seen such a window.

395
00:27:50,596 --> 00:27:54,548
Lloyd George said, "You have
done great things for Germany.

396
00:27:55,297 --> 00:27:57,159
You have restored her honor,

397
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,532
and you have gained for her
equal rights."

398
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:05,016
To be continued

399
00:28:17,989 --> 00:28:20,824
Part 3
Adolf Hitler - The Greatest Story NEVER Told

400
00:28:34,258 --> 00:28:37,084
I've met a few.
Arm chair Politicians.

401
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:39,865
Care more about their money,
than they do their own country.

402
00:28:40,210 --> 00:28:42,027
Yes, but surely as your
Parties propaganda leader,

403
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:44,213
you must know, that in
order to defend their money

404
00:28:44,564 --> 00:28:45,836
they'll spend it.
A good deal of it.

405
00:28:46,367 --> 00:28:48,419
That is if someone they trust
tells them that it is a safe bet.

406
00:28:48,992 --> 00:28:49,860
That's where I come in.

407
00:28:50,965 --> 00:28:54,965
Herr Hitler, I can make you very popular.
Far more popular than him.

408
00:28:55,417 --> 00:29:03,327
But you have to admit,
the color catches the eye.

409
00:29:06,882 --> 00:29:08,803
Unlike the Soviets with their hammer
and sickle, the Nacional Socialist

410
00:29:09,283 --> 00:29:10,691
had no such flag or amblem.

411
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:13,083
Hitler not only wanted a simbol to
represent the NSDPA,

412
00:29:13,548 --> 00:29:15,450
but one powerful enough
to strikefear into the Communists.

413
00:29:16,093 --> 00:29:18,211
The once failed art student would
now set about to design

414
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,393
the most recognised flag
in history.

415
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:12,013
After 1945, the NSDAP flag will be
banned and portrayed by the

416
00:30:12,531 --> 00:30:13,875
media as a symbol of hate.

417
00:30:14,843 --> 00:30:16,347
It also be hijacked by extreme
political group,

418
00:30:16,889 --> 00:30:19,005
and others such as motocycle gangs,
who have no concept

419
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:21,308
of its oriinal anti-Communist design.

420
00:30:31,043 --> 00:30:33,603
THE BLUTFAHNE SWASTIKA

421
00:30:34,305 --> 00:30:36,603
The Blutfahne displayed at the attempted
Beer Hall Putsch in Munich in 1923

422
00:30:37,092 --> 00:30:38,836
ended up covered in the blood
of National Socialist members

423
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:40,989
either wounded or killed
by munich police.

424
00:30:41,621 --> 00:30:44,429
It was thereafter treated as a sacred object,
used at the Nuremberg Rallies

425
00:30:44,893 --> 00:30:47,205
by Adolf Hitler to "sanctify" new flags.

426
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,559
This most treasured of all NSDAP artefacts
was last seen on 18 October 1944.

427
00:30:51,089 --> 00:30:53,426
To this day its whereabouts
remain unkown.

428
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:15,788
On the morning of the
12th of March 1938,

429
00:31:15,823 --> 00:31:19,118
German soldiers crossed the
border into neighboring Austria.

430
00:31:19,218 --> 00:31:22,379
They were greeted not with bullets
and guns,

431
00:31:23,043 --> 00:31:25,117
but with roses and carnations.

432
00:31:31,416 --> 00:31:35,498
So much so, that the action became
known as the "Blumenkrieg",

433
00:31:36,187 --> 00:31:37,576
the "War of Flowers".

434
00:31:39,714 --> 00:31:41,314
Most of the Austrian people,

435
00:31:41,414 --> 00:31:45,613
envying what they saw as the
economic success and prestige,

436
00:31:45,713 --> 00:31:46,991
that Hitler had brought to Germany,

437
00:31:47,878 --> 00:31:50,254
now welcomed their German
neighbors.

438
00:31:51,312 --> 00:31:53,854
One People, One Reich,
One Leader.

439
00:31:58,910 --> 00:32:01,876
In a demonstration of how central
he was personally

440
00:32:02,285 --> 00:32:03,188
to this whole system,

441
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:06,581
Hitler traveled across
Austria on a campaign tour.

442
00:32:20,123 --> 00:32:25,849
In the future I want to be nothing other
than what I have been in the past:

443
00:32:26,519 --> 00:32:29,845
alerter of my people,
teacher of my people,

444
00:32:30,252 --> 00:32:31,765
and the Führer of my people.

445
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:41,914
As German troops cross the border
of Austria,

446
00:32:42,442 --> 00:32:44,482
Austrian troops simultaneously enter
the German cities of Munich,

447
00:32:44,858 --> 00:32:46,613
Dresden and Berlin, a sign to the
rest of world

448
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:48,690
of a peaceful reunification.

449
00:32:49,503 --> 00:32:51,245
An overhelming 99,7% of Austrian
citizens

450
00:32:51,691 --> 00:32:54,300
will deocratically vote to
reunite with Germany.

451
00:33:01,394 --> 00:33:02,306
... and this people...

452
00:33:03,537 --> 00:33:05,670
... do not come to the Reich...

453
00:33:07,327 --> 00:33:08,603
... with hat in hand.

454
00:33:11,292 --> 00:33:12,481
I myself...

455
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,997
... bring you home!

456
00:33:20,093 --> 00:33:22,993
I think the thing...
some period

457
00:33:23,093 --> 00:33:27,892
around the end of '37- '38,
Hitler feels well this is fine,

458
00:33:27,992 --> 00:33:29,591
but I didn't come to power

459
00:33:29,691 --> 00:33:33,291
just to restore German self
confidence and solve this more,

460
00:33:33,391 --> 00:33:35,090
he changed his gear I think.

461
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:39,243
And then getting rid of a number
of the old guard, and the army,

462
00:33:39,343 --> 00:33:43,397
and the foreign office, and so on.
And he becomes more aggressive.

463
00:33:45,688 --> 00:33:47,828
It was the 12th of March 1938.

464
00:33:48,519 --> 00:33:50,815
Austria was showered with Swastika's.
March 12, 1938

465
00:33:52,087 --> 00:33:55,686
He crossed the border near
his birth place at Braunau.

466
00:33:55,786 --> 00:33:57,686
People rejoiced him, the "Anschluss",

467
00:33:57,786 --> 00:34:01,685
which they saw as the fulfillment of
an old dream of the German nation.

468
00:34:01,785 --> 00:34:04,205
An emphatic display
of self determination.

469
00:34:04,984 --> 00:34:08,083
A right denied to the German
people of the Versailles Treaty,

470
00:34:08,183 --> 00:34:10,653
whose terms were generally considered
unjust.

471
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:14,082
Visibly moved he entered Vienna.

472
00:34:14,182 --> 00:34:19,181
The city that had seen his early
failures, now gave him a hero's reception.

473
00:34:19,281 --> 00:34:21,081
Homage was being
paid to the man

474
00:34:21,181 --> 00:34:24,680
who had achieved the
unification of the German people.

475
00:34:49,275 --> 00:34:53,374
The welcome here was
the most tumultuous yet.

476
00:35:19,629 --> 00:35:20,862
Heil Adolf Hitler!

477
00:35:32,765 --> 00:35:34,397
While in Leonding, Hitler visits
the grave of his parents

478
00:35:34,752 --> 00:35:36,512
situated across the street from
his childhood home.

479
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:10,917
THE BERGHOF - THE BAVARIAN ALPS

480
00:36:12,258 --> 00:36:14,975
It was here, far from the millions
of his followers,

481
00:36:15,584 --> 00:36:17,639
that Hitler felt most able to relax.

482
00:36:18,156 --> 00:36:19,687
The inner circle
at the "Berghof",

483
00:36:20,356 --> 00:36:24,047
saw a quite different man from the
charismatic Führer of the party rallies.

484
00:36:34,653 --> 00:36:38,802
Life at Hitler's retreat, was
both reassuring and agreeable.

485
00:36:38,902 --> 00:36:43,051
And their was an entertaining
side to the off duty Führer

486
00:36:43,151 --> 00:36:46,151
as Ribbentrop's private
secretary discovered.

487
00:36:46,351 --> 00:36:53,449
"I was overwhelmed by the possibility
to meet the Führer personally.

488
00:36:53,549 --> 00:37:00,648
And for instance, for the beginning,
he was a sort of a Messiah for me.

489
00:37:00,748 --> 00:37:05,247
He was a man
who liked to joke.

490
00:37:05,347 --> 00:37:11,445
He could laugh a lot. He
didn't accept two sort of jokes.

491
00:37:11,545 --> 00:37:15,344
Dirty jokes and political
jokes, they were bad.

492
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:19,144
But all the other jokes
he enjoyed terribly."

493
00:37:19,244 --> 00:37:23,443
Hitler had no close friends in whom
to confide his inner most feelings.

494
00:37:23,543 --> 00:37:26,242
He could never admit
human weakness to anyone.

495
00:37:26,442 --> 00:37:30,141
But the inner circle discovered
one secret of his private life,

496
00:37:30,241 --> 00:37:32,759
which was unknown
to ordinary Germans.

497
00:37:32,841 --> 00:37:38,230
"When Hitler was talking for hours and
I was standing near to the wall, waiting,

498
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:41,271
until they want some
papers or something?

499
00:37:42,339 --> 00:37:44,938
And the curtain opened,

500
00:37:45,038 --> 00:37:52,837
Eva Braun appeared and says,
"Adolf, we must to have lunch now."

501
00:38:44,126 --> 00:38:49,625
And she didn't bother him
with political questions.

502
00:38:49,725 --> 00:38:53,224
And he didn't want
to give her influence.

503
00:38:53,324 --> 00:38:57,423
And he thought that as
long as he is a bachelor,

504
00:38:57,523 --> 00:39:01,021
he has the love of
the German women.

505
00:39:01,121 --> 00:39:02,822
Because if he's married,

506
00:39:02,922 --> 00:39:06,291
the impression is not the
same on the other women.

507
00:39:07,121 --> 00:39:10,920
And she gave him a little bit...

508
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:15,234
a home of bourgeois,

509
00:39:15,698 --> 00:39:21,890
a quality with tea, with cake,
and I think with sex."

510
00:39:22,518 --> 00:39:25,217
You think it was a
sexual relationship?

511
00:39:25,317 --> 00:39:26,338
"Certainly."

512
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:58,839
In 1919. the Allies at Versailles formed
a new country called Czechosovakia.

513
00:39:59,518 --> 00:40:00,746
The population will now consists of...

514
00:40:01,339 --> 00:40:02,946
6.7 million Czechs
3.1 million Germans

515
00:40:03,443 --> 00:40:04,715
2.0 million Slovacs
700.000 Hungarians

516
00:40:05,131 --> 00:40:06,343
460.000 Ukrainians

517
00:40:18,773 --> 00:40:21,180
With Czech violence against ethnic
German minorities on the rise,

518
00:40:21,803 --> 00:40:24,841
Sudeten Germans are forced to call
for the reunification with Germany.

519
00:40:55,559 --> 00:40:58,242
Czech President Edvard Benes will
instead order martial law

520
00:40:58,684 --> 00:41:00,957
imposed on the Sudeten provinces,
forcing a furious Adolf Hitler

521
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:03,021
to demand their return.

522
00:41:31,637 --> 00:41:33,181
26 Sept 1938

523
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:43,275
I have put an offer to Herr Benes...

524
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:48,733
an offer that is nothing other
than reaisation of his promises.

525
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:52,897
The decision is his now!
Be it war or peace?

526
00:41:54,456 --> 00:41:56,481
He can either accept my offer
and give the Germans their freedom,

527
00:41:56,977 --> 00:42:02,079
or we Germans will go get
it ourselves!

528
00:42:08,335 --> 00:42:13,436
4 POWER CONFERENCE CALLED BY
HITLER; AVERTS CZECH INVASION

529
00:42:14,876 --> 00:42:19,139
28 Sept 1938, British Prime Minister
Neville Chamberlain departs for Germany

530
00:42:25,635 --> 00:42:27,457
The Munich Peace Conference

531
00:42:34,298 --> 00:42:35,834
"IT IS PEACE WITH HONOUR"
SAYS CHAMBERLAIN

532
00:42:35,869 --> 00:42:38,678
A wave of relief and gratitude
for the Führer swept Germany.

533
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:42,577
His iron nerve had freed the Germans
in Czechoslovakia,

534
00:42:43,136 --> 00:42:44,735
and yet averted war.

535
00:42:47,714 --> 00:42:49,905
You secured us victory...

536
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:54,876
now you secure us peace.

537
00:42:55,514 --> 00:42:58,326
Heil Hitler! Sieg heil!

538
00:42:59,735 --> 00:43:01,102
Sieg heil! Sieg heil!

539
00:43:16,016 --> 00:43:17,639
To be continued

540
00:43:21,577 --> 00:43:24,749
Part 4
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

541
00:43:27,050 --> 00:43:27,927
The US state department

542
00:43:28,303 --> 00:43:32,988
in its 3-volume report on the origins of
Communism in Russia, published in 1931,

543
00:43:33,748 --> 00:43:35,946
reveals how Jewish controlled German
banks

544
00:43:36,355 --> 00:43:37,993
under the leadership of Max Warburg

545
00:43:38,345 --> 00:43:43,036
conspired as early as 1914 to send
large payments to Lenin, Trotsky,

546
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,933
and others in their attempts
to bring down the Tsar.

547
00:43:46,740 --> 00:43:48,318
When the White Russian patriots

548
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,350
heroically attempted to regain
their freedom from the Jews,

549
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:57,031
the Judaica says compact Jewish
masses were utilized by the Bolsheviks

550
00:43:57,384 --> 00:43:59,110
to suppress such counter revolution.

551
00:44:00,289 --> 00:44:03,665
Clearly Jews and native Russians
were engaged in a death struggle

552
00:44:04,046 --> 00:44:05,338
over the destiny of Russia.

553
00:44:07,055 --> 00:44:11,631
Unfortunately, the Jewish masses won...
the Jewish masses won... the Jewish...

554
00:44:14,765 --> 00:44:17,550
"We will survive",
that's what they tell us.

555
00:44:18,451 --> 00:44:21,342
What they mean is,
"THEY will survive!"

556
00:44:22,323 --> 00:44:23,637
We surrendered in November,

557
00:44:24,117 --> 00:44:26,966
at a time when we were perched
on the edge of victory,

558
00:44:27,763 --> 00:44:31,387
betrayed by the cowards
and the traitors within our ranks.

559
00:44:34,064 --> 00:44:35,485
"Lousy Communist pigs!"

560
00:44:36,678 --> 00:44:37,734
How do we fight them?

561
00:44:38,431 --> 00:44:41,920
We unite! We must join together,
for a greater Germany!

562
00:44:43,086 --> 00:44:46,149
We will hang the profiteers,
crush the Communists,

563
00:44:46,614 --> 00:44:49,555
we will disinfect our country
of the Jewish vermin!

564
00:44:51,657 --> 00:44:53,986
We will sacrifice,
we will struggle yes,

565
00:44:54,496 --> 00:44:58,618
but only then will we triumph.
And we will triumph!

566
00:44:59,608 --> 00:45:05,120
We will triumph! We will triumph!
- We will triumph! We will triumph!

567
00:45:05,753 --> 00:45:08,834
We will triumph!
We will triumph...

568
00:45:11,653 --> 00:45:14,027
What exactly was the "great stab
in the back"

569
00:45:14,691 --> 00:45:16,364
that Hitler had always talked about?

570
00:45:24,768 --> 00:45:26,266
In 1961, former Zionist Benjamin
Freedman gave a speech

571
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,257
at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C.

572
00:45:28,728 --> 00:45:30,534
on the World War One betrayal
of the German people.

573
00:45:33,727 --> 00:45:34,432
WORLD WAR ONE

574
00:45:34,752 --> 00:45:38,887
1914 was the year in which
World War I broke out.

575
00:45:39,556 --> 00:45:44,001
Within two years,
Germany had won that war.

576
00:45:44,677 --> 00:45:47,949
The German submarines,
which were a surprise to the world,

577
00:45:48,476 --> 00:45:52,044
had swept all the convoys
from the Atlantic Ocean,

578
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:56,892
and Great Britain stood there
without ammunition for her soldiers,

579
00:45:57,533 --> 00:46:03,021
stood there with one week's food
supply and after that, starvation.

580
00:46:03,689 --> 00:46:06,352
At that time the French
army had mutinied;

581
00:46:06,942 --> 00:46:11,052
they lost 600.000 of the
flower of the French youth.

582
00:46:11,604 --> 00:46:15,719
The Russian army was defecting;
they didn't like the Tsar,

583
00:46:15,877 --> 00:46:18,025
and the Italian Army had collapsed.

584
00:46:18,425 --> 00:46:22,264
Not a shot had been fired
on the German soil.

585
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:25,273
Not an enemy solider had crossed
the border

586
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:27,231
into Germany and yet,

587
00:46:28,224 --> 00:46:32,439
here was Germany offering England
peace terms.

588
00:46:33,425 --> 00:46:39,482
Well, England in the summer of
1916 was considering that, seriously,

589
00:46:40,017 --> 00:46:43,083
they had no choice.
While that was going on,

590
00:46:44,369 --> 00:46:49,124
the Zionists in Germany
went to the British war cabinet,

591
00:46:49,594 --> 00:46:52,892
"Look here, you can win this war,

592
00:46:53,526 --> 00:46:56,504
if the United States will come
in as your Ally.

593
00:46:57,068 --> 00:46:58,461
The price you must pay us,

594
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:01,476
is Palestine after you have
won the war

595
00:47:02,102 --> 00:47:06,325
and defeated Germany,
Austria-Hungary, and Turkey."

596
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:10,366
They made that promise
in October of 1916.

597
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:17,438
Now, that is something that the people in
the United States have never been told.

598
00:47:17,990 --> 00:47:21,550
They never knew why
we went into World War I.

599
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,048
After we got into the war,
Lord Balfour

600
00:47:25,365 --> 00:47:27,869
the Zionists went to Great Britain
and they said,

601
00:47:28,901 --> 00:47:30,723
"Let's have something in writing

602
00:47:31,747 --> 00:47:35,835
that shows that you are
going to keep your bargain

603
00:47:36,236 --> 00:47:38,558
and give us Palestine
after you win the war."

604
00:47:40,211 --> 00:47:43,357
And that was called
"The Balfour Declaration".

605
00:47:43,612 --> 00:47:49,132
The Balfour Declaration was merely
Great Britain's promise to pay the Zionists

606
00:47:49,668 --> 00:47:50,806
what they had agreed upon

607
00:47:51,472 --> 00:47:55,144
as a consideration for getting
the United States into the war.

608
00:47:55,908 --> 00:47:59,481
That is where all
the trouble started."

609
00:47:59,860 --> 00:48:01,757
WAR DECLARED BY UNITED STATES
Resolution passed by both houses of legislature

610
00:48:01,857 --> 00:48:02,867
Army of 2.000.000.

611
00:48:04,895 --> 00:48:06,150
Munich, Germany
April 1919

612
00:48:08,237 --> 00:48:09,470
Down with the Kaiser!

613
00:48:10,261 --> 00:48:12,199
Death to the Kaiser!

614
00:48:14,920 --> 00:48:16,767
The Treaty of Versailles on
28 June 1919

615
00:48:17,287 --> 00:48:18,493
and the Treaty of Saint-Germain
on 20 September

616
00:48:18,593 --> 00:48:21,489
of the same year ensured that German
people would be thoroughly humiliated.

617
00:48:24,361 --> 00:48:26,631
With millions unemployed, revolucionary
Jewish Communist leaders

618
00:48:27,047 --> 00:48:29,479
Karl Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg
will atempt a "red" revolution.

619
00:48:31,087 --> 00:48:32,999
British Prime Minister Lloyd George
wrote:

620
00:48:34,098 --> 00:48:36,258
"The international bankers swept statesman,
politicians and journalists all to one side

621
00:48:36,756 --> 00:48:39,292
and issued their orders with the
imperiousness of absolute monarchs."

622
00:48:49,804 --> 00:48:51,316
The Daily Mail reported 10 July 1933:

623
00:48:52,551 --> 00:48:54,416
"The German Nation was rapily falling
under control of alien elemens.

624
00:48:54,833 --> 00:48:56,672
In the last days of the pre-Hitler regime
there were twenty times more

625
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,886
Jewish gouverment officials in Germany
as had existed before the war."

626
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:01,655
Jews of internationl attachments-
and with Communist persuasions-

627
00:49:02,120 --> 00:49:04,141
had successfully insinuated into
the German administrative sistem.

628
00:49:05,292 --> 00:49:06,962
In 1933, as the new National Socialist
government is removing these Jews

629
00:49:07,370 --> 00:49:09,210
from influential positions, the worldwide
Jewish boycott

630
00:49:09,615 --> 00:49:11,144
of German goods begins.

631
00:49:17,865 --> 00:49:19,985
The German boycott of Jewish business
concerns came in April 1933,

632
00:49:20,377 --> 00:49:22,808
only after the Jewish declaration of war
was announced earlier in March.

633
00:49:29,296 --> 00:49:31,956
JUDEA DECLARES WAR ON GERMANY

634
00:49:38,596 --> 00:49:39,411
Above all,

635
00:49:40,291 --> 00:49:41,940
we must remove the Jews.

636
00:49:43,411 --> 00:49:45,529
They run our banks,
they lost us the war.

637
00:49:46,384 --> 00:49:48,430
They alone are responsible for
the economic disaster we're in.

638
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:53,238
"When you ask, what have
the Germans done to the Jews,

639
00:49:53,607 --> 00:49:56,277
you must always ask, what have
done the Jews to the Germans.

640
00:49:56,839 --> 00:50:04,816
Since 1850, when the Jews became
got all the political rights in Germany,

641
00:50:05,364 --> 00:50:10,212
the German Reich; they have done
3 things which are really dramatic.

642
00:50:10,247 --> 00:50:15,771
Number 1: They were a small
minority of 2% of the population.

643
00:50:16,436 --> 00:50:24,001
At the time when Hitler came to power,
500.000 within 60 million German people.

644
00:50:24,528 --> 00:50:28,456
500.000 among 60 million.
They were a small minority.

645
00:50:28,831 --> 00:50:34,543
This small minority managed to
control of about 50% of the media;

646
00:50:35,360 --> 00:50:39,179
to give about 70% of all judges;

647
00:50:39,824 --> 00:50:44,361
to have a tremendous influence
in movie, and in theater,

648
00:50:44,977 --> 00:50:47,978
and in literature, they
were over-represented.

649
00:50:48,513 --> 00:50:51,489
This is one thing, they were
absolutely overrepresented

650
00:50:51,913 --> 00:50:54,815
as today in England, in
France, and in United States.

651
00:50:55,248 --> 00:50:59,813
Second, Jews were
at the origin of a lot of

652
00:51:00,198 --> 00:51:08,159
catastrophic financial bank crashes
in Germany between 1870 and 1920.

653
00:51:08,813 --> 00:51:12,006
In that time, they made a
lot of crashes, which have...

654
00:51:12,566 --> 00:51:15,187
This is all documented, it's not Nazi
propaganda,

655
00:51:15,523 --> 00:51:17,627
or anti-Semitic, or Arab propaganda.

656
00:51:18,036 --> 00:51:19,336
It's a lot of books have been published,

657
00:51:19,711 --> 00:51:22,112
even by Jewish-Germans,
about this problem.

658
00:51:22,377 --> 00:51:26,776
They have millions of
German fathers have lost

659
00:51:27,275 --> 00:51:32,467
their uh, their uh, their incomes
their uh their fortune, their savings,

660
00:51:32,899 --> 00:51:38,829
because of these Jewish gangsters,
bank gangsters and speculation people.

661
00:51:39,682 --> 00:51:42,563
Then the third point which was
psychologically

662
00:51:42,923 --> 00:51:44,243
the most dangerous of all,

663
00:51:44,682 --> 00:51:50,097
they have introduced into German
art and culture and theater and movie:

664
00:51:50,677 --> 00:51:52,425
decadence - immorality.

665
00:51:52,886 --> 00:51:58,536
The first homosexual theaters, plays
were made in Berlin in the 1920s.

666
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,026
The first adultery theater plays

667
00:52:02,378 --> 00:52:07,266
were made in the 1880s and the 1890s,
a hundred years ago,

668
00:52:07,796 --> 00:52:14,074
by Jewish authors, adultery,
then sexual perversions of all sorts:

669
00:52:14,419 --> 00:52:19,027
sadism, masochism, lot of
homosexuality all these things and

670
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:23,635
then the decadent art you know,
an art which is absolutely ridiculous,

671
00:52:24,018 --> 00:52:27,699
so called modern art, it was
all pushed by Jewish intellectuals

672
00:52:28,108 --> 00:52:34,426
and this created among the
German people, a big, uh, a big revolt.

673
00:52:34,794 --> 00:52:40,168
And they also, they wrote books,
ridiculing Christianity, ridiculing Jesus.

674
00:52:40,679 --> 00:52:42,842
And there were furious reactions
in Germany.

675
00:52:43,257 --> 00:52:45,825
And this is why Adolf Hitler
came to power.

676
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:50,028
And you see then Hitler in
two years, from '33 to '35,

677
00:52:50,726 --> 00:52:54,560
he brought six million unemployed
Germans back into their jobs.

678
00:52:55,070 --> 00:52:57,701
He created 6 million jobs.
It's incredible."

679

KRISTALLNACHT
9-10 november 1938

680
00:53:12,151 --> 00:53:14,384
The November 1938 assassinion of te
German diplomat Ernst von Rath in Paris

681
00:53:15,674 --> 00:53:17,535
by te Jew Herschel Grynszpan was
the pretext for the progoms

682
00:53:17,957 --> 00:53:19,645
agaist the German Jews that followed.

683
00:53:20,097 --> 00:53:21,277
At the time, Joseph Goebbels
was negotiating

684
00:53:21,711 --> 00:53:23,641
to overturn te international Jewish
trade embargo.

685
00:53:23,718 --> 00:53:27,105
He moved quicky to halt the vioence,
fearing it would derail the talks.

686
00:53:33,976 --> 00:53:35,749
NAZIS SMASH, LOOT AND BURN JEWISH
SHOPS AND TEMPLES

687

UNTIL GOEBBELS CALLS HALT

688
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:49,667
THE TRANSFER AGREEMENT

689
00:53:52,562 --> 00:53:56,403
Secret negotiations between the
Nazis and the Zionists in 1933,

690
00:53:56,657 --> 00:53:57,210
22 April 1984- Channel 5 News

691
00:53:57,245 --> 00:54:00,363
which allowed German Jews and
their assets to go to Palestine.

692
00:54:01,349 --> 00:54:03,336
The Transfer Agreement
The Dramatic Sory of the Pact Between

693
00:54:03,726 --> 00:54:05,493
the Third Reich and Jewish Palestine

694
00:54:15,016 --> 00:54:16,520
A group of Zionists,
at the same time,

695
00:54:16,888 --> 00:54:19,096
was quietly negotiating an
agreement with the Nazis,

696
00:54:19,728 --> 00:54:21,389
to allow the immigration
of German Jews

697
00:54:21,711 --> 00:54:23,776
and the transfer of their assets
to Palestine.

698
00:54:24,741 --> 00:54:28,639
That deal, reported in August 1933,
was the Transfer Agreement.

699
00:54:29,351 --> 00:54:31,769
Palestine, sparsely
settled by Jews at the time,

700
00:54:32,093 --> 00:54:33,757
was radically changed as a result.

701
00:54:34,491 --> 00:54:37,532
I lived in Palestine
from 1933 to 1936.

702
00:54:38,429 --> 00:54:43,215
And uh, we saw, every week,
passports of German Jews,

703
00:54:44,318 --> 00:54:45,902
coming to settle in Palestine.

704
00:54:46,534 --> 00:54:50,230
German-Jewish settlement of Palestine
was, for a time, official Nazi policy.

705
00:54:50,967 --> 00:54:53,239
These photos, of Jewish life
in Palestine,

706
00:54:53,566 --> 00:54:56,217
along with a lengthy text,
appeared in 1934,

707
00:54:56,808 --> 00:54:59,513
in the Berlin paper,
Der Angriff, the publisher,

708
00:55:00,037 --> 00:55:02,855
Hitler's propaganda
minister Joseph Goebbels.

709
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:06,863
"A Nazi Visits Palestine", was
the title of the multi-part series.

710
00:55:07,424 --> 00:55:09,600
A medal was struck by
Goebbels in commemoration.

711
00:55:10,199 --> 00:55:14,399
On one side the Swastika,
on the other, The Star Of David.

712
00:55:15,207 --> 00:55:17,639
Hitler demanded one concession
for the transfer agreement.

713
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,704
That the call for a Boycott of the Reich,
raised by Jews here and elsewhere,

714
00:55:22,145 --> 00:55:23,631
be rejected by the Zionists.

715
00:55:24,458 --> 00:55:25,994
The Zionists made that concession.
London, England

716
00:55:26,094 --> 00:55:27,631
Judea declares war on Germany
BOYCOTT ALL GERMAN GOODS

717
00:55:32,388 --> 00:55:33,718
THE TRANSFER AGREEMENT

718
00:55:34,557 --> 00:55:36,094
The Transfer Agreement was a pact
that allowed Jews to emigrate

719
00:55:36,595 --> 00:55:38,011
from Germany to Palestine
with their wealt intact.

720
00:55:38,580 --> 00:55:40,107
This is contrary to all anti-Hitler
propaganda.

721
00:55:41,114 --> 00:55:42,682
The agreement was concluded
in August 1933,

722
00:55:43,157 --> 00:55:44,893
following talks between German
officials

723
00:55:45,484 --> 00:55:47,349
and the Palestine Center of the
World Zionist Organisation.

724
00:55:48,259 --> 00:55:50,225
Each Jew bound for Palestine deposited
money into a special account in Germany.

725
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:52,096
The funds were used to purchase
German goods

726
00:55:52,545 --> 00:55:54,227
which were exported to Palestine
and sold there

727
00:55:54,754 --> 00:55:56,747
by the Jewish-owned Haavara
company in Tel Aviv.

728
00:56:06,273 --> 00:56:08,658
Profits from the sales were then given
to the Jewish emigrant upon his arrival,

729
00:56:09,082 --> 00:56:10,800
an amount corresponding to the
initial deposit in Germany.

730
00:56:15,395 --> 00:56:17,158
Thus, the agreement served the Zionist
aim of bringing Jewish settlers

731
00:56:17,571 --> 00:56:19,028
and development capital to Palestine,

732
00:56:19,539 --> 00:56:21,250
whilst simultaneously advancing
the German goal

733
00:56:21,666 --> 00:56:23,083
of freeing the country of an
unwanted alien group.

734
00:56:23,635 --> 00:56:25,344
As a result, Hitler's government vigorously
supported the emigration

735
00:56:25,793 --> 00:56:27,456
of Jews to Palestine from 1933
until 1940-41,

736
00:56:27,890 --> 00:56:29,358
when the Second World War
prevented futher collaboration.

737
00:56:42,855 --> 00:56:44,766
HITLER'S JEWISH SOLDIERS

738
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:51,397
Approximately 150.000 soldiers with
Jewish blood would eventually fight

739
00:56:51,734 --> 00:56:53,447
for the armed forces on the
Third Reich.

740
00:56:53,909 --> 00:56:54,950
These included:

741
00:56:55,342 --> 00:56:56,414
2 Field Marrshals

742
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:58,054
15 Generals

00:56:58,444 --> 00:56:59,618
8 Lieutenant Generals

744
00:57:00,113 --> 00:57:01,329
5 Major Generals

745
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,656
Together they commanded up
to 100.000 troops.

746
00:57:15,963 --> 00:57:17,860
20 Jews would also win the Reich's
highest military honour,

747
00:57:18,321 --> 00:57:20,033
the Knight's Cross.

748

Emil Maurice was a personal friend
of Hitler's,

754
00:57:41,754 --> 00:57:43,625
and his one-time chauffer
and bodyguard.

755
00:57:44,113 --> 00:57:45,712
He was also an early member
of the NSDAP

756
00:57:46,223 --> 00:57:47,704
and one of the founders
of the SS.

757
00:57:57,735 --> 00:57:59,175
The Führer stood by his old friend

758
00:57:59,658 --> 00:58:01,298
when Maurice's Jewish ancestry
was discovered,

759
00:58:01,815 --> 00:58:03,152
declaring him an "Honorary Aryan".

760
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:10,883
He was allowed to remain
in the SS...

761
00:58:20,667 --> 00:58:22,572
To be continued

762
00:58:27,682 --> 00:58:29,842
Part 5
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

763
00:58:50,203 --> 00:58:51,960
On 28 June 1914 Serbian radical
Gavrilo Princip assassinated

764
00:58:52,506 --> 00:58:54,078
Austrian Archduke Franc Ferdinand
in Sarajevo.

765
00:58:54,566 --> 00:58:56,271
One month later on 28 July 1914
Austria declared war on Serbia,

766
00:58:56,768 --> 00:58:58,536
initiating World War One.

767
00:59:07,479 --> 00:59:08,799
Munich, Germany
May 1914

768
00:59:19,617 --> 00:59:20,441
Come closer!

769
00:59:23,305 --> 00:59:24,231
Let me speak!

770
00:59:25,222 --> 00:59:29,055
England, France and Russia are
joining forces against our ally Austria.

771
00:59:30,231 --> 00:59:33,126
We must stand with her,
united, ready to sacrifice.

772
00:59:38,230 --> 00:59:39,948
Eventually the victorious Allies
would hold Germany alone

773
00:59:40,427 --> 00:59:41,826
for World War One.

774
00:59:42,552 --> 00:59:44,368
The next twenty years would see
the German population suffer terribly

775
00:59:45,028 --> 00:59:46,929
from the consequences of the
Treaty of Versailles.

776
00:59:57,657 --> 00:59:59,185
To understand the causes of World
War Two,

777
00:59:59,658 --> 01:00:03,877
we must first studi the aftermath
of World War One.

778
01:00:14,948 --> 01:00:16,705
The allied leaders were arguing
their way

779
01:00:17,048 --> 01:00:18,816
over the whole future
of the German people.

780
01:00:23,376 --> 01:00:25,577
Under their hands the map of
Europe was drawn,

781
01:00:26,526 --> 01:00:27,574
and re-drawn again.

782
01:00:28,523 --> 01:00:30,899
At last, after more than
three months of discussion,

783
01:00:31,427 --> 01:00:33,663
they presented the terms of
their treaty to the Germans.

784
01:00:35,147 --> 01:00:38,303
Germany lost land in the
East, the West, and the North.

785
01:00:38,707 --> 01:00:42,060
In the East, the most important of those
losses was the wide strip of territory

786
01:00:42,491 --> 01:00:44,271
given to the newly independent
Poland,

787
01:00:44,793 --> 01:00:47,373
separating East Prussia
from the rest of Germany.

788
01:00:50,248 --> 01:00:54,509
While on the West, France took back
the provinces of Alsace and Lorraine.

789
01:00:57,651 --> 01:01:00,435
And was also given the
right to mine coal in the Saar,

790
01:01:00,889 --> 01:01:03,954
an area placed under League
of Nations control for 15 years.

791
01:01:08,366 --> 01:01:12,215
To protect France, Germany was forbidden
to station soldiers in the Rhineland,

792
01:01:12,966 --> 01:01:16,879
an area which was to be
occupied by Allied troops until 1935.

793
01:01:19,344 --> 01:01:22,191
It was not only the loss of
territory which Germany resented,

794
01:01:22,984 --> 01:01:25,600
but also the fact that Czechoslovakia
and Poland,

795
01:01:26,831 --> 01:01:28,293
now contained large numbers
of Germans.

796
01:01:29,035 --> 01:01:30,509
And as if to add insult to injury,

797
01:01:30,981 --> 01:01:32,889
the treaty forbade German
speaking Austria

798
01:01:33,251 --> 01:01:34,665
to unite with Germany.

799
01:01:36,274 --> 01:01:38,043
Her fortifications were to be
destroyed.

800
01:01:38,977 --> 01:01:41,858
Her army was to be
reduced to a 100.000 men.

801
01:01:43,353 --> 01:01:46,504
No Air Force.
No submarines.

802
01:01:46,632 --> 01:01:49,705
And to accept blame for starting
the War and pay reparations.

803
01:01:50,031 --> 01:01:52,275
So, in the high summer of 1919,

804
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:54,557
the German delegates were brought
to the great

805
01:01:54,932 --> 01:01:56,989
Hall of Mirrors of Versailles
to sign the peace treaty.

806
01:01:57,966 --> 01:01:59,196
It was a compromised peace

807
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:02,620
that satisfied not even one
single Allied leader,

808
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:05,455
and predictably the
Germans loathed it.

809
01:02:06,702 --> 01:02:08,548
The Germans argued that
the Germany,

810
01:02:08,868 --> 01:02:10,751
to which they were returning
had suffered poverty

811
01:02:11,290 --> 01:02:13,064
and unemployment in
the years since the war,

812
01:02:14,190 --> 01:02:16,985
and couldn't afford the vast
sums demanded by the Allies.

813
01:02:25,961 --> 01:02:28,089
But these arguments
didn't impress the Allies,

814
01:02:28,488 --> 01:02:32,421
who fixed the sum of 6.600.000.000
pounds for the Germans to pay.

815
01:02:35,568 --> 01:02:38,043
That sum would have to be
paid in goods as well as money.

816
01:02:38,794 --> 01:02:40,630
Most would come from here
in the Ruhr,

817
01:02:41,207 --> 01:02:42,903
the industrial heart of Germany.

818
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:48,045
But at the end of 1922, the Germans
fell behind with their payments,

819
01:02:48,522 --> 01:02:49,842
and Raymond Poincare,

820
01:02:50,256 --> 01:02:52,616
the new French Prime Minister,
decided to act.

821
01:02:53,472 --> 01:02:55,859
If Germany wouldn't pay in full
and on the nail,

822
01:02:56,538 --> 01:02:58,539
then France would help herself.

823
01:02:59,149 --> 01:03:01,523
So, on the 11th of January, 1923,

824
01:03:02,076 --> 01:03:04,197
French and Belgian troops entered
the Ruhr

825
01:03:04,505 --> 01:03:05,808
to force the Germans to pay up.

826
01:03:08,798 --> 01:03:12,354
There was of course, after Versailles,
no German army big enough to stop them.

827
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:16,607
At first, the French believed that they
could make the Germans work for them.

828
01:03:17,101 --> 01:03:21,477
But suddenly, German politicians and
people were united in a common cause;

829
01:03:21,972 --> 01:03:23,172
hatred of the French.

830
01:03:23,850 --> 01:03:26,523
And huge protest meetings
were held all over Germany.

831
01:03:27,312 --> 01:03:30,522
Their attitude towards the
Germans in the Ruhr began to harden.

832
01:03:31,257 --> 01:03:33,640
They tried to cut off the Ruhr
off from the rest of the country.

833
01:03:34,688 --> 01:03:37,768
German visitors were searched as
if they were entering a foreign land.

834
01:03:52,180 --> 01:03:54,665
1923 was disastrous for Germany.

835
01:03:55,228 --> 01:03:57,868
In that year, the great
German inflation reached its peak.

836
01:03:58,643 --> 01:04:00,946
For some time the value of
the Mark had been dropping.

837
01:04:01,569 --> 01:04:03,083
As the value of the notes decreased,

838
01:04:03,482 --> 01:04:06,676
so the amounts of notes needed
to buy things grew.

839
01:04:06,711 --> 01:04:08,251
Banks became more
and more hard pressed,

840
01:04:08,640 --> 01:04:10,625
to meet the ever-increasing
demand for paper money.

841
01:04:10,725 --> 01:04:11,405
Closed

842
01:04:11,545 --> 01:04:14,109
For their customers,
suitcases replaced wallets.

843
01:04:15,161 --> 01:04:16,738
As Germany slipped towards disaster,

844
01:04:17,148 --> 01:04:19,436
Gustav Stresemann was appointed
Chancellor.

845
01:04:20,954 --> 01:04:23,996
The loss of production in the
Ruhr was making inflation even worse,

846
01:04:24,676 --> 01:04:27,924
and Stresemann realized that the only
way to help the economy back to normal,

847
01:04:28,420 --> 01:04:31,836
was to call off resistance there,
and get production going again.

848
01:04:32,626 --> 01:04:33,748
The government also announced

849
01:04:34,069 --> 01:04:36,317
that Germany would resume
the payment of reparations;

850
01:04:36,811 --> 01:04:39,146
it was the only possible
way of getting the French out.

851
01:04:40,048 --> 01:04:41,051
But to the nationalists,

852
01:04:41,387 --> 01:04:44,530
it looked like again another pathetic
surrender to Germany's enemies.

853
01:04:45,299 --> 01:04:47,119
General Ludendorff, who had never
accepted

854
01:04:47,440 --> 01:04:48,481
that Germany had ever been
defeated,

855
01:04:49,327 --> 01:04:51,339
gave his support to Adolf Hitler,

856
01:04:52,005 --> 01:04:54,398
the leader of the new National
Socialist party.

857
01:05:00,435 --> 01:05:01,905
1939 THE POLISH CONFLICT

858
01:05:06,711 --> 01:05:08,104
Problems had arisen in Poland
over access

859
01:05:08,616 --> 01:05:10,935
to the German territory of East Prussia
and coastal city of Danzig.

860
01:05:11,269 --> 01:05:13,029
Hitler on several occasions presented
proposals to try

861
01:05:13,501 --> 01:05:14,730
and resolve both situations peaceably,

862
01:05:15,153 --> 01:05:16,642
but the Poles refused to seriously
negotiate.

863
01:05:17,489 --> 01:05:19,586
Now in Poland, just like in Czechoslovakia,
the safety of ethnic Germans

864
01:05:20,042 --> 01:05:21,729
was again becoming a concern
for Hitler.

865
01:05:31,984 --> 01:05:33,081
DANZIG

866
01:05:33,366 --> 01:05:37,076
Until 1934, conflicts between
Germany and Poland smoldered.

867
01:05:37,588 --> 01:05:39,179
Danzig, next to East Prussia,

868
01:05:39,522 --> 01:05:41,559
had been completely cut off
from the Reich.

869
01:05:45,749 --> 01:05:48,286
Warsaw continued to try to rest
total control

870
01:05:48,774 --> 01:05:50,990
over this strategically important
harbor city.

871
01:05:52,595 --> 01:05:55,254
In West Prussia, the
situation was similar.

872
01:05:55,546 --> 01:05:58,918
East Prussia was now completely
cut off from the German Reich.

873
01:06:04,681 --> 01:06:07,404
Bolstered by English and
French guarantees of war support,

874
01:06:07,722 --> 01:06:11,260
Poland has no further incentive to
negotiate in good faith with Germany,

875
01:06:11,552 --> 01:06:15,042
and in the meantime in Warsaw,
maps are suddenly starting to circulate

876
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,459
which contain a new Western-Polish
border,

877
01:06:17,802 --> 01:06:19,600
extending to just West of Berlin.

878
01:06:20,311 --> 01:06:24,303
All across Poland, the so-called
pogroms against the minorities begin.

879
01:06:25,460 --> 01:06:29,143
Night after night, polish border
officials shot at the fleeing Germans.

880
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:32,703
Shortly before the official outbreak
of war,

881
01:06:33,065 --> 01:06:37,036
there were already 80.000
ethnic Germans in refugee camps

882
01:06:37,178 --> 01:06:38,963
in both Danzig and the German Reich.

883
01:06:45,873 --> 01:06:48,562
The misery of the
minority Germans in Poland

884
01:06:49,089 --> 01:06:51,683
had now developed the third and most
pressing reason

885
01:06:52,109 --> 01:06:54,297
that would lead to the outbreak
of war.

886
01:06:57,609 --> 01:06:59,337
"The democratic states should not be
vain as to think

887
01:06:59,818 --> 01:07:02,927
this state of affairs will last forever."
Adolf Hitler 1939

888
01:07:09,142 --> 01:07:11,852
THE DANZIG MASSACRES

889
01:07:18,017 --> 01:07:21,050
Hitler now has a problem that Britain
and France will declare war on them.

890
01:07:21,321 --> 01:07:23,850
At this point, Poland is actually
committing,

891
01:07:24,257 --> 01:07:26,785
pretty bad atrocities against the

892
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:30,625
German minority in West Prussia,

893
01:07:31,144 --> 01:07:34,096
in the German part of Poland
at that time.

894
01:07:35,301 --> 01:07:37,184
And so given that Poles
are committing atrocities

895
01:07:37,588 --> 01:07:38,828
against the German minority in Poland,

896
01:07:39,663 --> 01:07:42,868
Hitler is now at a
very tough situation.

897
01:07:43,496 --> 01:07:47,252
Basically it's like, alright
if I don't declare war on

898
01:07:47,653 --> 01:07:49,917
Poland, if I don't go in and
help these Germans out,

899
01:07:50,398 --> 01:07:52,986
well then, the German minorities are
just going to keep getting slaughtered.

900
01:07:53,644 --> 01:07:57,662
And it's not an insignificant amount of
Germans in that area who are being killed,

901
01:07:58,090 --> 01:08:01,830
it was pretty bad what was going on,
what the Poles were doing in that area.

902
01:08:02,506 --> 01:08:05,637
And so, he was basically
saying well, if we don't go in,

903
01:08:06,030 --> 01:08:07,886
then those Germans are just
going to keep getting slaughtered.

904
01:08:09,176 --> 01:08:12,972
If we go in, we're going to find
ourselves at war with Poland,

905
01:08:13,504 --> 01:08:17,003
France, and Britain, and
possibly the Soviet Union.

906
01:08:20,305 --> 01:08:21,706
But in a move of brilliant cunning,

907
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:26,142
he astonished the world in the summer
of 1939, by doing a deal with Stalin.

908
01:08:26,627 --> 01:08:27,620
With Stalin on his side,

909
01:08:28,219 --> 01:08:31,598
Hitler was sure nobody else would
interfere, when he attacked the Poles.

910
01:08:32,382 --> 01:08:33,343
German Foreign Minister
Joachim von Ribbentrop

911
01:08:33,394 --> 01:08:35,463
Whilst the military commissions
of the Western powers

912
01:08:35,768 --> 01:08:37,027
are still negotiating in Moscow

913
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:40,236
with a view of enlisting Russia
in their front against Germany,

914
01:08:40,777 --> 01:08:42,148
Reich Foreign Minister Von Ribbentrop

915
01:08:42,489 --> 01:08:45,460
flies to the Soviet capital to
sign a pact of non-aggression

916
01:08:45,847 --> 01:08:49,253
and consultation with Mr. Stalin
and Foreign Commissar Molatov.

917
01:08:52,316 --> 01:08:53,995
1 SEPTEMBER 1939

918
01:08:57,756 --> 01:09:00,018
Applause greets the Führer
who has just arrived

919
01:09:00,452 --> 01:09:02,917
at the Kroll Opera House
to address the Reichstag,

920
01:09:03,365 --> 01:09:04,869
which has been called
in an extraordinary session.

921
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:14,050
"Danzig was and is a German city.

922
01:09:14,658 --> 01:09:17,480
to have only Germany to thank
for their cultural development.

923
01:09:33,236 --> 01:09:35,305
I told the Polish ambassador
three weeks ago,

924
01:09:35,666 --> 01:09:37,754
that if the situation continued
as it was,

925
01:09:38,193 --> 01:09:42,023
if Danzig was persecuted, and if it
were attempted by Poland

926
01:09:42,695 --> 01:09:44,062
to ruin Danzig economically,

927
01:09:44,455 --> 01:09:46,036
the situation could
not be tolerated."

928
01:09:51,503 --> 01:09:54,543
"We interrupt this broadcast of Adolf
Hitler's speech just moments early,

929
01:09:54,904 --> 01:09:58,344
to report a dispatch from Paris, which
says that Premier Daladier of France,

930
01:09:58,718 --> 01:10:02,012
has now called the French Council of
Ministers for an emergency meeting."

931
01:10:12,731 --> 01:10:13,441
Polish troops are mobilised

932
01:10:13,476 --> 01:10:14,984
"I, therefore, resolve
to speak to Poland

933
01:10:15,489 --> 01:10:18,991
in the same language in which Poland
has addressed us for such a long time."

934
01:10:31,334 --> 01:10:32,015
Danzig is liberated the same day

935
01:10:32,050 --> 01:10:33,415
"Once again we interrupt very briefly.

936
01:10:33,944 --> 01:10:36,286
This talk by Chancellor Hitler,
to announce that, in London,

937
01:10:36,764 --> 01:10:39,429
Parliament has been
summoned to meet at 6 pm in London."

938
01:10:51,039 --> 01:10:55,252
"Poland, for the first time, this evening,
has shot at regular soldiers upon our territory.

939
01:11:03,723 --> 01:11:06,268
From now on, bomb will be met
by bomb."

940
01:11:16,421 --> 01:11:18,108
Poland had greatly underestimate the
German armed forces.

941
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:20,778
The tactic of attacking the enemy
with great speed

942
01:11:21,170 --> 01:11:23,127
known as Blitzkrieg, or "lightning war",
is utterly devstating.

943
01:11:23,820 --> 01:11:25,363
The plight of the German minorities
had become clear.

944
01:11:25,828 --> 01:11:27,124
During the last weeks before
the outbreak of war,

945
01:11:27,547 --> 01:11:29,071
racial propaganda in the Polish press
played a major role

946
01:11:29,334 --> 01:11:31,182
in the persecution of Germans
already hounded and harrassed.

947
01:11:31,877 --> 01:11:33,315
Acts of violence against the Germans
continue,

948
01:11:33,753 --> 01:11:36,055
and would eventually include a total
of 58.000 slaughtered.

949
01:11:52,998 --> 01:11:55,439
The worst massacres will take place
between 31August and 6 September.

950
01:11:55,861 --> 01:11:58,108
The climax came on 3 September in Bromberg,
in what is known as "Bloody Sunday".

951
01:11:58,722 --> 01:12:00,547
The mass murders would only end on
18 September

952
01:12:01,099 --> 01:12:02,999
with the arrival of German
troops near Lowitsch.

953
01:12:03,911 --> 01:12:05,592
Those found guilty of taking part
in the brutal killings

954
01:12:05,998 --> 01:12:07,880
now faced dead by firing squad.

955
01:12:22,060 --> 01:12:23,926
LONDON, ENGLAND
3 SEPTEMBER 1939

956
01:12:27,661 --> 01:12:28,850
"I am speaking to you,

957
01:12:30,169 --> 01:12:33,112
from the Cabinet Room,
at 10 Downing Street.

958
01:12:35,172 --> 01:12:38,175
This morning, the British ambassador
in Berlin,

959
01:12:39,376 --> 01:12:42,679
handed the German government,
a final note,

960
01:12:43,823 --> 01:12:48,072
stating that unless we heard from them
by 11 o'clock,

961
01:12:49,215 --> 01:12:50,999
that they were prepared at once,

962
01:12:51,430 --> 01:12:53,528
to withdraw their troops
from Poland,

963
01:12:54,432 --> 01:12:57,200
a state of war would exist
between us.

964
01:12:59,212 --> 01:13:00,526
I have to tell you now,

965
01:13:01,399 --> 01:13:03,872
that no such undertaking
has been received,

966
01:13:05,206 --> 01:13:10,317
and that, consequently, this
country is at war with Germany."

967
01:13:16,663 --> 01:13:18,612
To be continued

968
01:13:24,764 --> 01:13:27,554
Part 6
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

969
01:13:31,033 --> 01:13:33,223
Within two days, the issues involving
the human rights of German minorities,

970
01:13:33,679 --> 01:13:35,351
as well as the disputies over Danzig
and isolated East Prussia,

971
01:13:35,795 --> 01:13:37,455
would turn into World War Tho.

972
01:13:38,888 --> 01:13:41,649
From the beginning the civilian population
feels the jmpact of the invasion.

973
01:13:43,266 --> 01:13:45,249
As casualties mount Polish civilians,
with the full support of their military,

974
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:47,928
hunt down any Germans still
in Poland.

975
01:13:49,367 --> 01:13:51,551
Following the invasion, there is a wave
of house searches;

976
01:13:52,038 --> 01:13:54,501
ethnic Germans are beaten and raped,
with at last 5.000 murdered.

977
01:13:55,447 --> 01:13:57,510
The massacres, especially in the sity
of Bromberg, will be hidden

978
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,118
from the history books.

979
01:13:59,479 --> 01:14:01,486
They will eventually emerge as one
of the most henious of crimes

980
01:14:01,927 --> 01:14:03,582
to be inflicted upon a
civil population.

981
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:42,652
DANZIG
16 SEPTEMBER 1939

982
01:14:49,947 --> 01:14:54,442
As a soldier in the World War
who only fought in the West...

983
01:14:55,553 --> 01:14:59,380
I never had the opportunity to
witness such deeds...

984
01:15:01,827 --> 01:15:04,681
the thousands of slaughtered
Volksgennossen...

985
01:15:06,745 --> 01:15:09,494
the brutally butchered women
and children...

986
01:15:12,910 --> 01:15:16,565
the countless German soldiers and
officers who fell, wounded...

987
01:15:16,940 --> 01:15:19,526
in the hands of the enemy and who
were massacred

988
01:15:20,259 --> 01:15:22,914
and bestially mutilated with their
eyes gouged out...

989
01:15:28,889 --> 01:15:31,546
and worse yet, the Polish government
has

990
01:15:32,545 --> 01:15:35,434
openly admitted this in a
radio broadcast...

991
01:15:36,810 --> 01:15:41,769
the Lufttwaffe soldiers, thet were
forced to parachute,

992
01:15:42,674 --> 01:15:44,714
were to be killed in a cowardly fashion.

993
01:15:52,132 --> 01:15:53,968
THE GERMAN-SOVIET
NON-AGGRESSION PACT

994
01:15:54,799 --> 01:15:56,651
In securing the Molotov-Ribbentrop
Pact with the Soviets

995
01:15:57,132 --> 01:15:58,607
and offering Stalin the Eastern
half of Poland,

996
01:15:59,725 --> 01:16:01,756
Hitler hopes that the Russian presence
there will prevent Britain and France

997
01:16:02,164 --> 01:16:03,540
from declaring war.

998
01:16:03,957 --> 01:16:05,749
This would now allow Hitler to protect
the German minorities,

999
01:16:06,257 --> 01:16:08,012
and at same time reclaim the teritories
lost at Versailles.

1000
01:16:08,661 --> 01:16:10,299
Although both Germany and Soviets
invade Poland,

1001
01:16:10,790 --> 01:16:13,086
war by the Allies is only
declared on Germany.

1002
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,646
On 17 September 1939, Stalin invades
Poland and claims

1003
01:16:25,102 --> 01:16:26,717
the Eastern teritory as agreed.

1004
01:16:28,070 --> 01:16:29,909
Meanwhile, Hitler on three separate
occasions, offers the opportunity

1005
01:16:30,370 --> 01:16:33,560
of uncondicional surrender to
the Polish commander in Warsaw.

1006
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:37,461
Poland refuses all ultimatums und
the German assault begins.

1007
01:16:38,085 --> 01:16:40,957
Warsaw capitulates in just 24 hours
at the cost of 40.000 dead or injured.

1008
01:16:54,180 --> 01:16:55,620
The war with Poland last
just 29 days.

1009
01:16:55,651 --> 01:16:58,147
Hitler didn't want a
general war, what he wanted,

1010
01:16:58,570 --> 01:17:02,818
and I have no doubt about this,
he wanted a war to destroy Poland.

1011
01:17:04,513 --> 01:17:05,847
That he was prepared for.

1012
01:17:06,384 --> 01:17:10,353
For a moment, he was disconcerted
to find that he might be involved in war

1013
01:17:10,737 --> 01:17:14,801
with Britain and France, because,
this had never been his plan.

1014
01:17:15,873 --> 01:17:17,994
He had always regarded
Britain as his natural allien.

1015
01:17:18,821 --> 01:17:20,403
But, in the end, he accepted.

1016
01:17:20,811 --> 01:17:22,332
'Look, I have a
Nazi-Soviet pact,

1017
01:17:22,858 --> 01:17:26,292
which guarantees that this will
not develop into a general war.

1018
01:17:26,603 --> 01:17:29,780
I shall be able to knock Poland out in
three weeks, which he more or less did.

1019
01:17:30,565 --> 01:17:34,804
After that, the West isn't
going to start up a war again.

1020
01:17:43,688 --> 01:17:45,130
PLANS FOR A LONG WAR

1021
01:17:45,230 --> 01:17:47,070
CHURCHILL IS NEW NAVY CHIEF

1022
01:18:00,853 --> 01:18:01,980
MAY 1940

1023
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:05,310
In theirs quests to prevent Germany
from reclaiminig territory

1024
01:18:05,797 --> 01:18:08,686
lost under the Treaty of Versailles,
Britain and France refuse any offers of peace.

1025
01:18:10,277 --> 01:18:12,349
In reality, they are worried about
Germany's rapid economic growth,

1026
01:18:12,766 --> 01:18:14,528
and will not suffer futher
German advancement.

1027
01:18:15,056 --> 01:18:16,647
At stake are the British and French
empires,

1028
01:18:17,376 --> 01:18:20,076
with the British alone ruling
over 480 million people.

1029
01:18:30,885 --> 01:18:32,621
French Empire 1919- 1939

1030
01:18:34,930 --> 01:18:36,779
British Empire 1919- 1939

1031
01:18:40,611 --> 01:18:41,725
10 May 1940

1032
01:18:42,909 --> 01:18:44,776
With French troops mobilising and
more British troops arriving

1033
01:18:45,241 --> 01:18:46,576
on the mainland by the day,

1034
01:18:47,256 --> 01:18:49,072
Germany has no alternative
but to go on the offensive.

1035
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,737
The British Establishment replaced
Nevil Chamberlain as Prime Minister,

1036
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:53,360
shoosing Winston Churchill instead.

1037
01:18:53,864 --> 01:18:55,656
The same day Hitler invades
France trough Belgium.

1038
01:20:16,676 --> 01:20:17,982
The armies of Britain and France
are no much for this

1039
01:20:18,326 --> 01:20:19,389
new German war machine.

1040
01:20:19,846 --> 01:20:21,324
There will be no World War One
trench warfare,

1041
01:20:21,771 --> 01:20:23,323
as the tactic of the Blitzkrieg once
again proves devastating.

1042
01:20:24,180 --> 01:20:25,746
In a matter of weeks the Germans seize
vital territory and resources in Europe,

1043
01:20:26,187 --> 01:20:28,647
and eventually outtlank and trap
the Allies on the coast of France.

1044
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:30,712
With their backs against the
English Channel,

1045
01:20:31,123 --> 01:20:33,458
both the world's leading colonial
armies face total annihilation.

1046
01:20:53,458 --> 01:20:55,737
Hitler delays the attack for two days,
leaving the British time

1047
01:20:56,103 --> 01:20:57,575
for chaotic evacuation
from the Port of Dunkirk.

1048
01:20:58,324 --> 01:20:59,669
Althout most histrians see this
as a gesture of peace,

1049
01:21:00,085 --> 01:21:01,565
others still insist it was
a military blunder.

1050
01:21:02,422 --> 01:21:04,566
Humiliated, the British Empire now has
to rely on civilian sailing vessels

1051
01:21:04,974 --> 01:21:06,581
and merchant fishing boats to help
ferry troops back

1052
01:21:06,965 --> 01:21:08,213
across the English Channel.

1053
01:21:08,854 --> 01:21:10,076
With all their heavy artillery, tenks
and armoured vehicles

1054
01:21:10,428 --> 01:21:11,601
left on the shores of France,
they are a spent force,

1055
01:21:12,003 --> 01:21:13,867
but will look for other means
of continuing the war.

1056
01:21:24,182 --> 01:21:26,707
Six weeks of German
Blitzkrieg defeats France.

1057
01:21:29,508 --> 01:21:30,755
Paris is Hitler's.

1058
01:21:40,226 --> 01:21:41,603
Hitler will have the French authorities
surrender at Compiegne

1059
01:21:41,993 --> 01:21:43,850
using the very same carriage in
which the Germans had been compelled

1060
01:21:44,208 --> 01:21:45,962
to ask for an armistice in
World War One.

1061
01:21:46,937 --> 01:21:48,376
Carriage No. 2149D was rolled out
of its protective building

1062
01:21:48,799 --> 01:21:50,791
to the precise spot it
occupied on 11 Nov 1919.

1063
01:22:00,197 --> 01:22:00,646
1940 FRANCE

1064
01:22:00,681 --> 01:22:02,418
France asked
Hitler for an armistice.

1065
01:22:06,395 --> 01:22:10,124
Shortly before 3 o'clock, on
the afternoon of June 21st, 1940,

1066
01:22:10,971 --> 01:22:12,697
he arrived in the
forest of Compiegne.

1067
01:22:17,104 --> 01:22:20,142
Hitler himself took the seat
where Marshall Foch had sat.

1068
01:22:20,849 --> 01:22:24,544
The French delegation led by General
Huntziger followed closely behind.

1069
01:22:26,777 --> 01:22:28,688
When the French
delegation entered the carriage,

1070
01:22:29,393 --> 01:22:31,965
Hitler could fully relish
the peak of his career.

1071
01:22:33,021 --> 01:22:34,507
Long ago on entering politics,

1072
01:22:35,155 --> 01:22:39,506
he had sworn never to rest until the shame
of November 1918 had been wiped out.

1073
01:22:40,617 --> 01:22:41,646
Now, he had done it.

1074
01:22:42,346 --> 01:22:44,945
But the dream of his lifetime,
he said, had been fulfilled.

1075
01:22:46,153 --> 01:22:47,929
1940 BERLIN

1076
01:23:03,175 --> 01:23:05,710
Berlin greeted him
with flowers of jubilation.

1077
01:23:06,694 --> 01:23:10,840
Hitler's triumphal return to Berlin,
sent a flood of respect and adulation.

1078
01:23:14,413 --> 01:23:15,784
"The church
bells rang all day,

1079
01:23:16,848 --> 01:23:21,295
and the mood of elation really
penetrated throughout the country."

1080
01:23:25,919 --> 01:23:31,064
"My feelings towards Hitler were such
as if he were some super human being

1081
01:23:31,486 --> 01:23:35,211
between man and a
God, sent by Providence."

1082
01:24:01,130 --> 01:24:05,011
This was the man who had obliterated
the humiliation of The First World War.

1083
01:24:09,027 --> 01:24:10,763
The same day in a speech at the Reichstag
Hitler presented Britain

1084
01:24:11,131 --> 01:24:12,426
with yet another offer
of peace.

1085
01:24:18,994 --> 01:24:20,506
LONDON, ENGLAND

1086
01:24:27,508 --> 01:24:29,452
Secret government documents reveal
that a British received

1087
01:24:29,828 --> 01:24:31,796
over a dozen offers of peace
between 1939 and 1941,

1088
01:24:32,260 --> 01:24:34,484
despite their desperate military
straits after the evacuation at Dunkirk.

1089
01:24:36,436 --> 01:24:38,616
Prime Minister Winston Churchill however
would have none of it.

1090
01:24:39,232 --> 01:24:41,165
Because he is aware Britain cannot
defeat Germany alone,

1091
01:24:41,533 --> 01:24:43,670
he will do his utmost to drag
the US into the war.

1092
01:24:59,709 --> 01:25:02,292
It will however mean the eventual
loss of the British Empire.

1093
01:25:07,730 --> 01:25:09,191
1940 BRITAIN

1094
01:25:11,393 --> 01:25:16,618
Germany was absolutely in a
position to direct the course of the war.

1095
01:25:17,128 --> 01:25:20,223
All we had to defeat now,
we believed, was Britain.

1096
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:23,510
The German fighter
ace, Adolf Galland,

1097
01:25:23,971 --> 01:25:26,306
also thinks the next
priority is the Battle of Britain,

1098
01:25:26,897 --> 01:25:30,386
but when he meets Hitler, he discovers
that the Führer's priorities are different.

1099
01:25:33,215 --> 01:25:38,558
Galland: "I told him that our good time
would come, and we could bomb London

1100
01:25:39,036 --> 01:25:41,475
and the fighters could... the
English fighters couldn't take off.

1101
01:25:41,924 --> 01:25:44,372
He said "No, no,
no, no... stop this.

1102
01:25:45,372 --> 01:25:46,243
I don't like this.

1103
01:25:47,148 --> 01:25:50,036
I really don't like the
fight against England.

1104
01:25:50,490 --> 01:25:54,012
The English people are so
similar people to the Germans,

1105
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:59,907
and I have the highest respect for
the English building up an empire.

1106
01:26:01,219 --> 01:26:03,532
So, you must understand,

1107
01:26:03,956 --> 01:26:07,644
I'm forced to fight this fight
against England, but I don't like it."

1108
01:26:11,571 --> 01:26:16,203
I think that he himself had not
got any great wish to engage

1109
01:26:16,619 --> 01:26:21,493
on an invasion of Britain, because
all the time by now we know,

1110
01:26:21,891 --> 01:26:24,761
he was already beginning to get
itchy, and wanting to turn eastwards,

1111
01:26:25,595 --> 01:26:26,681
after defeating France.

1112
01:26:27,806 --> 01:26:28,942
But Göring insisted

1113
01:26:29,357 --> 01:26:32,860
that with the Luftwaffe, with the Air
Force alone, he could knock Britain out.

1114
01:26:33,986 --> 01:26:35,724
So he gave him his head
to try.

1115
01:26:45,437 --> 01:26:47,746
Initially, Hitler had insisted that only
military installations were to be bombed.

1116
01:26:49,938 --> 01:26:51,671
However, on 4 Sept 1940, he explained
in a speech to the Reichstag,

1117
01:26:52,047 --> 01:26:54,589
way after months of British targeting
German civilians in nightly bombing raids,

1118
01:26:55,047 --> 01:26:56,982
he now has no choice but to
retaliate in kind.

1119
01:26:58,430 --> 01:27:00,181
"While the German planes fly over
English land day by day

1120
01:27:00,591 --> 01:27:02,910
no Englishman has managed to so much
as cross the North Sea by daylight.

1121
01:27:04,171 --> 01:27:05,785
That is way they come at night
and drop their bombs,

1122
01:27:06,202 --> 01:27:08,254
you know it well, indiscriminately
and on civilian residents,

1123
01:27:08,583 --> 01:27:09,582
farms and villages.

1124
01:27:10,006 --> 01:27:11,892
Wherever they see a light,
they drop a bomb.

1125
01:27:13,530 --> 01:27:15,299
I did not answer for three months
because I was of an opinion

1126
01:27:15,832 --> 01:27:16,900
they would stop this nonsense.

1127
01:27:17,299 --> 01:27:19,340
Mr. Churchill perceived this as a sign
of our weakness.

1128
01:27:21,588 --> 01:27:24,291
You will surely understand that we are
now giving our answers night after night,

1129
01:27:24,996 --> 01:27:26,748
and this at an increasing rate."

1130
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:27,802
To be continued

1131
01:28:34,215 --> 01:28:36,273
Part 7
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

1132
01:28:37,609 --> 01:28:40,471
Hello America, this is Edward
Murrow speaking from London.

1133
01:28:41,256 --> 01:28:43,342
There were more German planes
over the coast of Britain today

1134
01:28:43,694 --> 01:28:44,934
than at any time
since the war begun.

1135
01:28:49,771 --> 01:28:51,981
Despite the British Empire's vast
resources, and vast the millions of

1136
01:28:52,461 --> 01:28:54,133
men at her disposal, including...

1137
01:28:54,606 --> 01:28:55,599
1 million Australians

1138
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:57,239
2 million Indians

1139
01:28:57,676 --> 01:28:58,845
1 million Canadians

1140
01:28:59,672 --> 01:29:02,169
... Churchill and Roosevelt will push
for the US to enter the war.

1141
01:29:03,762 --> 01:29:05,881
However, polls consistently show
that ordinary Americans have no

1142
01:29:06,290 --> 01:29:09,984
wish to be involved in what to
them is yet another Europian civil war.

1143
01:29:21,423 --> 01:29:23,063
In spite on this, Roosevelt will now
force laws through Congress

1144
01:29:23,455 --> 01:29:25,183
making a mockery of the US's
supposed neutrality.

1145
01:29:27,571 --> 01:29:29,393
in favor of one-sided supply of arms
to Germany's enemies.

1146
01:29:30,288 --> 01:29:32,320
The same year, Roosevelt freezes all
assets of defeated European countries,

1147
01:29:32,702 --> 01:29:34,792
refusing to recognise their
recognise their new governments.

1148
01:29:43,675 --> 01:29:45,475
The "Destroyers for US Bases" agreement
is passed, whereby 50 reconditioned

1149
01:29:45,835 --> 01:29:47,419
US Navy destroyers are transfered to
the Royal Navy

1150
01:29:47,761 --> 01:29:48,890
in exchange for British bases
in the Caribbean.

1151
01:29:49,473 --> 01:29:50,984
Roosevelt will persuade congress to
pass the Lend-Lease Act

1152
01:29:51,385 --> 01:29:53,089
which officially ends his pretense
of being neutral.

1153
01:29:53,480 --> 01:29:55,996
He will also allow American citizens
to enter the British Air Force.

1154
01:29:58,187 --> 01:30:00,601
Roosevelt freezes all German assets in the US,
a violation of international law.

1155
01:30:01,161 --> 01:30:03,425
The US announces an oil embargo
against "aggressor" nations.

1156
01:30:04,053 --> 01:30:05,902
$ 1 billion dollars in Lend-Lease aid
is sent to Britain.

1157
01:30:06,668 --> 01:30:08,547
The US will eventually ship a total of
$ 31.4 billion worth of supplies,

1158
01:30:08,865 --> 01:30:10,871
the equivalent of $ 445 billion
in today's money.

1159
01:30:11,365 --> 01:30:12,724
The loans will take Britain 61 years
to repay,

1160
01:30:13,101 --> 01:30:15,486
with the last installment made
in 2006.

1161
01:30:22,413 --> 01:30:28,085
By an overwhelming majority congress
passed Lend-Lease... bill number 1776.

1162
01:30:29,211 --> 01:30:33,490
I've asked this congress
for authority and for funds,

1163
01:30:34,315 --> 01:30:40,282
sufficient to manufacture additional
munitions and war supplies of many kinds,

1164
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:45,963
to be turned over to those
nations which are now in actual war,

1165
01:30:46,847 --> 01:30:49,104
with aggressor nations.

1166
01:30:50,001 --> 01:30:51,943
Our most useful
and immediate roll,

1167
01:30:52,823 --> 01:30:57,965
is to act as an arsenal for
them as well as for ourselves.

1168
01:30:58,959 --> 01:31:06,167
We shall send in ever increasing
numbers: ships, planes, tanks, guns.

1169
01:31:06,727 --> 01:31:09,693
That is our purpose
and our pledge.

1170
01:31:13,685 --> 01:31:15,460
The enormous amount of US funds,

1171
01:31:15,764 --> 01:31:17,429
along with the covert US operations
in the Atlantic

1172
01:31:17,835 --> 01:31:19,291
help Britain sustain the war
against Germany.

1173
01:31:19,292 --> 01:31:20,292
The quick knockout blow Göring
had hoped for now seemed unlikely,

1174
01:31:20,293 --> 01:31:22,962
and the Battle of Britain will shortly
give way to a more important fight.

1175
01:31:24,087 --> 01:31:26,068
Hitler will now concentrate on the battle
he believes will eventually

1176
01:31:26,541 --> 01:31:28,300
the outcome of World War Two.

1177
01:31:29,259 --> 01:31:31,195
On 11 December 1941, he gives a speech
describing the growing Soviet menace.

1178
01:31:32,385 --> 01:31:34,441
"Already in 1940 it became increasingly
clear from month to month

1179
01:31:34,856 --> 01:31:36,864
that the plans of the Kremlin
were aimed at the domination,

1180
01:31:36,885 --> 01:31:38,738
and thus the destruction of Europe.

1181
01:31:38,868 --> 01:31:40,960
Only a blind person could fail to see
that a military build-up of

1182
01:31:41,304 --> 01:31:43,575
unique world-historical proportions
was being carried out."

1183
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,718
Clearly the Soviet Union had
been expanding West.

1184
01:31:47,744 --> 01:31:49,216
30 November 1939- Finland is atacked.

1185
01:31:49,696 --> 01:31:51,272
21 February 1940- Sweden is bombed.

1186
01:31:52,335 --> 01:31:53,993
18 June 1940- Estonia, Latvia, Lithuaia
are invaded.

1187
01:31:55,921 --> 01:31:58,313
27 June 1940- Romania is forced by Stalin
to surrender Bessarabia.

1188
01:32:12,676 --> 01:32:14,801
Hitler feels that not only is Germany
in grave danger,

1189
01:32:15,049 --> 01:32:16,794
but indeed the whole of Europe.

1190
01:32:16,795 --> 01:32:18,625
He knows the horrors the
Bolsheviks will bring.

1191
01:32:19,463 --> 01:32:21,788
Rather than wait, after meeting with
his generals, Hitler will now plan

1192
01:32:22,227 --> 01:32:23,963
a pre-emptive strike against the
Soviet Union,

1193
01:32:24,402 --> 01:32:26,250
in what will be known as
Operation Barbarossa.

1194
01:32:26,739 --> 01:32:28,402
To understand Hitler's fears for Europe,
we must first look at

1195
01:32:28,914 --> 01:32:30,600
the Bolshevik regime and Stalin,
the man President Roosevelt

1196
01:32:30,992 --> 01:32:33,358
would affectionately call "Uncle Joe".

1197
01:32:43,025 --> 01:32:44,841
STALIN

1198
01:32:48,926 --> 01:32:51,023
Stalin came to power
on the death of Lenin,

1199
01:32:51,464 --> 01:32:53,814
and ruled the Soviet
Union by fear and torture

1200
01:32:54,232 --> 01:32:55,824
for nearly the next 30 years.

1201
01:32:56,670 --> 01:32:57,619
During that time,

1202
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:01,951
he was responsible for some
40 million deaths.

1203
01:33:13,870 --> 01:33:17,319
Stalin spent his first years in
power consolidating his position.

1204
01:33:18,212 --> 01:33:22,332
He managed to sideline Trotsky,
whom he perceived as his major rival.

1205
01:33:32,748 --> 01:33:37,467
In 1929 Stalin implemented a
policy known as collectivization.

1206
01:33:39,611 --> 01:33:43,426
Lenin's experiment in nationalizing
the land had remained half finished,

1207
01:33:44,071 --> 01:33:46,993
and Russian peasants were
still working their own land

1208
01:33:47,367 --> 01:33:49,167
and selling their own
produce in the markets.

1209
01:33:58,920 --> 01:34:00,355
By means of collectivization,

1210
01:34:00,834 --> 01:34:03,027
Stalin meant to complete Lenin's
initiative,

1211
01:34:03,552 --> 01:34:07,815
and to take away all of the peasants
lands and produce in the name of the state.

1212
01:34:09,776 --> 01:34:14,217
In 1930, peasant's produce
began to be collected up.

1213
01:34:15,311 --> 01:34:20,289
The Red Army one-by-one seized
the produce from every single field.

1214
01:34:28,762 --> 01:34:31,938
Some peasants managed to hide
their goods rather than give them up,

1215
01:34:33,041 --> 01:34:36,489
but communist party officials
searched every nook and cranny

1216
01:34:37,039 --> 01:34:39,237
eventually discovering
the hiding places.

1217
01:34:47,556 --> 01:34:50,957
The officials also seized the
peasant's agricultural equipment.

1218
01:34:52,085 --> 01:34:56,709
The peasants were left with nothing to
eat, and nothing to work the soil with.

1219
01:35:04,293 --> 01:35:07,655
Eventually, that catastrophe that
Lenin had described

1220
01:35:07,991 --> 01:35:09,972
as the most useful for communism

1221
01:35:10,291 --> 01:35:12,724
raised its head again... famine.

1222
01:35:18,478 --> 01:35:23,330
In Ukraine alone, 6 million people
starved over the next few years.

1223
01:35:24,074 --> 01:35:28,978
2 million died in Kazakhstan and
1 million in northern Caucasus.

1224
01:35:30,742 --> 01:35:33,681
Children reduced to skin
and bone died in agony.

1225
01:35:36,332 --> 01:35:41,493
There was another ghastly result of the
famine inspired by Stalin - cannibalism.

1226
01:35:42,246 --> 01:35:45,125
Peasants maddened by
hunger began to eat corpses.

1227
01:35:46,981 --> 01:35:48,667
Then an even
worse horror emerged,

1228
01:35:49,587 --> 01:35:52,196
some peasants had kidnapped
children and eaten them.

1229
01:36:01,803 --> 01:36:05,764
In front of these two Russian
peasants caught eating human flesh,

1230
01:36:06,347 --> 01:36:08,954
lay the remains of the
children they had snatched.

1231
01:36:17,145 --> 01:36:20,863
Stalin's regime had turned
human beings into savage animals

1232
01:36:21,351 --> 01:36:23,670
just as communism had intended.

1233
01:36:38,087 --> 01:36:42,392
Everyone who opposed Stalin's
collectivization policy paid with his life.

1234
01:36:44,295 --> 01:36:47,645
Tens of thousands of Kulaks
were detained and shot.

1235
01:36:59,990 --> 01:37:00,885
In actual fact,

1236
01:37:01,485 --> 01:37:06,365
the regime branded everyone it saw
as opposed to its ideology as Kulaks.

1237
01:37:07,845 --> 01:37:11,283
Large numbers of priests and even
members of their congregations,

1238
01:37:11,747 --> 01:37:14,826
who attended church
frequently were arrested as Kulaks.

1239
01:37:15,458 --> 01:37:16,626
Some were executed.

1240
01:37:18,228 --> 01:37:19,945
Others were sent to the labor camps,

1241
01:37:20,583 --> 01:37:23,270
where a slow lingering death
awaited them.

1242
01:37:24,578 --> 01:37:26,506
These camps were
set up all over Russia

1243
01:37:27,050 --> 01:37:30,004
and were simply another
of Stalin's killing machines.

1244
01:37:33,714 --> 01:37:38,156
Millions of people regarded as enemies
of the state were worked to death in them

1245
01:37:38,443 --> 01:37:40,387
under the most
terrible conditions.

1246
01:37:41,425 --> 01:37:44,810
Some were put to work laboring
on canals in the blazing heat,

1247
01:37:45,610 --> 01:37:49,499
others were sent off to break
rocks in the freezing cold of Siberia.

1248
01:37:50,787 --> 01:37:55,331
These people, forced to perform hard
labor under the worst possible conditions,

1249
01:37:56,032 --> 01:37:58,536
soon turned into living skeletons.

1250
01:37:59,368 --> 01:38:01,731
The great majority
never left the camps alive.

1251
01:38:05,698 --> 01:38:11,450
The Soviet Union, like every communist
country, was an economic basket case.

1252
01:38:11,980 --> 01:38:14,750
It could not produce
enough to survive.

1253
01:38:15,367 --> 01:38:20,630
And so, every communist / socialist
state has been dependent upon aid from

1254
01:38:21,901 --> 01:38:23,517
the capitalist producing states.

1255
01:38:23,965 --> 01:38:29,964
So, Russia was desperate for our aid,
both in terms of direct government aid,

1256
01:38:30,474 --> 01:38:34,491
but also in terms of opening up the
spigots for private capital markets,

1257
01:38:35,138 --> 01:38:40,122
particularly New York bankers and corpor-
ations to move into Russia in a big way.

1258
01:38:41,705 --> 01:38:46,892
In 1933 the Roosevelt administration invited
a Soviet representative to Washington

1259
01:38:47,434 --> 01:38:50,331
to negotiate terms of
diplomatic recognition.

1260
01:39:01,157 --> 01:39:02,272
Number of Deaths in Ukraine

1261
01:39:03,354 --> 01:39:05,080
1941 POLAND

1262
01:39:07,748 --> 01:39:10,077
Hans Frank is appointed
governor-general of Poland

1263
01:39:10,484 --> 01:39:13,139
and the country disappears from
the headlines of the world press.

1264
01:39:15,466 --> 01:39:17,949
Jews must wear the Star of David
on their arm,

1265
01:39:18,621 --> 01:39:20,126
not carry it in their pocket.

1266
01:39:21,096 --> 01:39:24,366
In Warsaw there is a
streetcar exclusively for Jews.

1267
01:39:26,777 --> 01:39:30,941
A district a mile and a half
square is transformed into a ghetto.

1268
01:39:31,916 --> 01:39:34,044
There is condemnation from the Allies
over the Jewish ghetto,

1269
01:39:34,418 --> 01:39:36,755
and yet it bears no comparison to
the many black ghettos in Amerika,

1270
01:39:37,090 --> 01:39:39,255
a country where Negroes were still
being lynched, and hanged from trees.

1271
01:39:39,495 --> 01:39:41,215
Britain's record on the "human rights"
of the subjects in her many colonies

1272
01:39:41,576 --> 01:39:43,616
is likewise cruel and racist.

1273
01:39:54,269 --> 01:39:55,686
Winston Churchill served in the Boer War
when thousends of women and children

1274
01:39:56,086 --> 01:39:59,209
were left to starve in British
concentration camps.

1275
01:39:59,310 --> 01:40:01,680
No one was ever brought to account for
the many crimes against humanity in...

1276
01:40:02,241 --> 01:40:02,950
India

1277
01:40:03,389 --> 01:40:04,293
Africa

1278
01:40:04,645 --> 01:40:05,675
Australia

1279
01:40:06,106 --> 01:40:08,146
... or for the mass drugging of the
population of China in the Opium Wars.

1280
01:40:12,181 --> 01:40:13,261
MEXICAN REPATRIATION ACT

1281
01:40:13,741 --> 01:40:15,792
In the US, the years between 1929
and 1939 saw the forced deportation

1282
01:40:16,118 --> 01:40:18,758
of 2 million Mexicans, as first
authorised by Presdent Herbert Hoover.

1283
01:40:19,160 --> 01:40:21,007
Of those, 1.2 million were born
American citizens.

1284
01:40:32,417 --> 01:40:35,248
The final US Army massacre of the "Indians"
occurs, at Wounded Knee, South Dakota.

1285
01:40:35,967 --> 01:40:37,665
By 1924, they are almost completely
wiped out.

1286
01:40:37,700 --> 01:40:38,903
Children that survive are sent to
boarding schools for re-education,

1287
01:40:39,242 --> 01:40:40,516
where teachers are instructed to...

1288
01:40:40,948 --> 01:40:42,793
"kill the Indian in them"

1289
01:40:58,667 --> 01:40:59,996
AMERICAN RACISM

1290
01:41:00,577 --> 01:41:02,014
Throughout World War Two and up
until the 1960's,

1291
01:41:02,404 --> 01:41:04,077
a majority of American States
enforced segregation

1292
01:41:04,445 --> 01:41:05,932
trough the use of "Jim Crow" laws.

1293
01:41:06,491 --> 01:41:08,290
States could impose legal punishment
on those

1294
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:10,373
consorting with members of
different race.

1295
01:41:11,092 --> 01:41:12,851
The most common types of laws
forbade intermarriage,

1296
01:41:13,146 --> 01:41:15,529
and mandated that businesses and
public institutions

1297
01:41:15,814 --> 01:41:16,885
segregate blacks and whites.

1298
01:41:17,423 --> 01:41:18,812
Here is just a sampling of the
various State laws:

1299
01:41:19,517 --> 01:41:20,563
ARIZONA

1300
01:41:20,588 --> 01:41:22,306
Intermarriage:
The marriage of a person with Caucasian

1301
01:41:22,341 --> 01:41:24,935
blood with a Negro, Mongolian, Malaysian,
or Hindu shall be null and void.

1302
01:41:25,996 --> 01:41:27,497
FLORIDA
Cohabitation:

1303
01:41:28,665 --> 01:41:30,457
Any Negroes or White person who are
not married to each other,

1304
01:41:30,977 --> 01:41:32,038
and occupy the nighttime in the
same room, shell be

1305
01:41:32,411 --> 01:41:34,273
punished by imprisonment or fine.

1306
01:41:34,373 --> 01:41:35,171
MISSOURI

1307
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:36,601
Intermarriage:

1308
01:41:37,521 --> 01:41:39,225
All marriages between... White persons
and Negroes or Mongolians

1309
01:41:39,617 --> 01:41:40,873
are prohibited and declared
absolutely void.

1310
01:41:57,170 --> 01:41:59,634
President Franklin D. Roosevelt had time
and time again resisted any

1311
01:42:00,251 --> 01:42:02,250
Republican Party efforts to pass
a Federal law prohibiting lynching.

1312
01:42:12,530 --> 01:42:14,699
In 1922, future President Harry Truman
joined the Ku Klux Klan.

1313
01:42:30,961 --> 01:42:33,568
1936 BERLIN
THE MYTH OF THE OLYMPIC GAMES

1314
01:42:37,911 --> 01:42:39,774
Anti-Germn propaganda in the US
claim that a furious Hitler

1315
01:42:40,183 --> 01:42:42,038
had ignored four-time Olympic gold
medalist Jesse Owens.

1316
01:42:42,694 --> 01:42:44,142
In his 1970 autobiography Owens
wrote:

1317
01:42:44,742 --> 01:42:46,359
"When I passed the Chancellor he arose,
waved his hand at me,

1318
01:42:46,772 --> 01:42:48,076
and I waved back at him.
I think the writers shoved

1319
01:42:48,444 --> 01:42:50,092
bad taste in criticism the man
of the hour in Germany."

1320
01:42:57,482 --> 01:42:59,147
On his return to the US, Owens will
not be invited to the White House.

1321
01:42:59,507 --> 01:43:01,453
He later said, "Hitler didn't snub me -
it was FDR who snubbed me.

1322
01:43:01,852 --> 01:43:03,404
The President didn't even send
me a telegram.

1323
01:43:04,267 --> 01:43:07,030
The Olympic champion later had to
make a living by racing horses.

1324
01:43:17,981 --> 01:43:19,621
In 1960, almost a quarter of a century
later, a young Casius Clay

1325
01:43:20,028 --> 01:43:21,357
threw his Olympic gold medal into
the Ohio river

1326
01:43:21,789 --> 01:43:23,229
after a waitress in a resturant
told him...

1327
01:43:30,839 --> 01:43:32,605
"We don't serve Niggers here."

1328
01:43:39,022 --> 01:43:41,326
To be continued

1329
01:43:45,587 --> 01:43:48,036
Part 8
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

1330
01:43:52,986 --> 01:43:54,728
Italy, which had allied with Germany
in 1940, was now fighting

1331
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:56,802
the British in Greece and in
the Middle East.

1332
01:43:57,786 --> 01:43:59,671
War had broken out in the Balkans,
where the worst atrocites

1333
01:44:00,087 --> 01:44:01,624
of World War Two would
soon take place.

1334
01:44:02,428 --> 01:44:03,896
Before Germany could invade
the Soviet Union,

1335
01:44:04,295 --> 01:44:05,839
Hitler would first have to send
the Vehrmacht

1336
01:44:06,205 --> 01:44:07,677
to help secure these regions.

1337
01:44:08,236 --> 01:44:09,653
Within six weeks, the British would
be forced

1338
01:44:10,093 --> 01:44:11,740
to retreat from both Greece
and the Middle East.

1339
01:44:12,822 --> 01:44:14,493
In Yugoslavia, the British-backed
government is quickly overthrown.

1340
01:44:15,045 --> 01:44:16,724
Croatia is now independent for the
first time in 900 years.

1341
01:44:17,310 --> 01:44:19,769
To this day, many Croats honour
Adolf Hitler as a liberator.

1342
01:44:26,393 --> 01:44:28,409
THE JAPANESE CONFLICT

1343
01:44:33,291 --> 01:44:34,680
Troughout the 1930's Japan has been
at war with China.

1344
01:44:36,656 --> 01:44:38,151
When Japan allied with Germany and
Italy in 1940,

1345
01:44:38,663 --> 01:44:40,166
the new Vichy French government
consented to the

1346
01:44:40,565 --> 01:44:42,165
Japanese occupation of France's
Indochina colonies.

1347
01:44:42,894 --> 01:44:44,574
The British Empire however, which also
had colonies in the region,

1348
01:44:44,966 --> 01:44:47,898
together with the US froze Japan's
assets in July 1941.

1349
01:44:54,649 --> 01:44:56,552
NEW YORK TIMES, 26 JULY 1941

1350
01:44:57,025 --> 01:44:59,072
"The measures, in effect, bring all financial
and import and export trade transactions

1351
01:45:00,409 --> 01:45:02,625
in which Japanese inerests are involved
under the kontrol of the US government."

1352
01:45:11,712 --> 01:45:13,592
On 1 August 1941, Roosevelt -
still looking for a way to enter the war -

1353
01:45:14,039 --> 01:45:16,979
forced an oil embrgo on Japan,
an intentional act of hostility.

1354
01:45:17,642 --> 01:45:20,124
Both these actions were taken before
fateful December 7 Pearl Harbour attack.

1355
01:45:21,068 --> 01:45:22,084
The results:

1356
01:45:23,407 --> 01:45:24,824
Japan lost access to 75 % of her
oversaes trade

1357
01:45:25,237 --> 01:45:26,581
and 88 % of her imported oil.

1358
01:45:26,950 --> 01:45:28,638
Soon there be insufficient resources
to continue war with China.

1359
01:45:30,806 --> 01:45:33,078
To try and resolve this the Japanese
entered into negotiations with US officias,

1360
01:45:33,565 --> 01:45:36,310
who demanded that Japan first withdraw
from China before the embargoes would end.

1361
01:45:38,094 --> 01:45:40,829
The Japanese would never permit themselves
to be humbled in such a way...

1362
01:45:41,692 --> 01:45:43,620
... a fact which Roosevelt must
have known.

1363
01:46:05,921 --> 01:46:08,167
In his book "Icebreaker", Russian historian
Victor Suvorov gives compelling proff

1364
01:46:08,647 --> 01:46:10,511
that Hitler was forced into a reluctant
pre-emptive strike

1365
01:46:10,910 --> 01:46:12,129
against massive Soviet military
machine

1366
01:46:12,537 --> 01:46:14,201
poised to invade whole of
Western Europe.

1367
01:46:15,233 --> 01:46:16,970
Suvorov quotes top secret Soviet
documents which make it crystal clear

1368
01:46:17,368 --> 01:46:19,561
that Soviet military was being built
as an offensive force.

1369
01:46:21,408 --> 01:46:23,225
The collateral damage inflicted on the
eleven Europaan countries

1370
01:46:23,689 --> 01:46:25,495
involved in Hitler's defensive measures
against Britain and France

1371
01:46:25,919 --> 01:46:27,431
had created an unprecedented situation
where their armies,

1372
01:46:27,846 --> 01:46:29,697
governments, and political parties
had been destryed.

1373
01:46:30,743 --> 01:46:32,399
Now with Europe totaly exposed,
Stalin is hoping Germany will

1374
01:46:32,799 --> 01:46:34,380
expand the war by sending
troops to Britain.

1375
01:46:35,989 --> 01:46:37,733
Instead, he is caught completely off
guard as 3 million soldiers

1376
01:46:38,158 --> 01:46:39,955
prepare to invade the atheisti Soviet
Union wearing

1377
01:46:40,331 --> 01:46:42,587
belt buckles engraved with the words...
Gott Mit Uns

1378
01:46:56,874 --> 01:46:58,214
From the Balic to the Black Sea

1379
01:46:58,839 --> 01:47:02,009
three million German soldiers,
are moving into position

1380
01:47:02,073 --> 01:47:02,951
22 JUNE 1941
OPERATION BARBAROSSA

1381
01:47:02,986 --> 01:47:04,549
to launch Operation
Barbarossa.

1382
01:47:06,796 --> 01:47:09,955
It's the most brutal conflict
between two nations in recorded history,

1383
01:47:10,572 --> 01:47:11,528
is about to begin.

1384
01:47:30,761 --> 01:47:34,674
On the first day of Barbarossa
alone, 1.200 Soviet aircraft

1385
01:47:35,009 --> 01:47:37,137
are destroyed in a single strike.

1386
01:47:46,135 --> 01:47:50,771
Panzer units sweeping East, are
already deep inside Soviet territory.

1387
01:47:54,311 --> 01:47:56,572
Chaos multiplies the catastrophe.

1388
01:47:59,950 --> 01:48:01,153
Without orders from the Kremlin,

1389
01:48:01,674 --> 01:48:04,290
Red Army field Commanders lose
control of their units.

1390
01:48:07,440 --> 01:48:11,837
Dazed, cut off, surrounded,
thousands of Soviet soldiers surrender.

1391
01:48:14,780 --> 01:48:17,497
And at the height of the
Wehrmacht's furious onslaught,

1392
01:48:18,299 --> 01:48:20,387
Stalin disappears completely.

1393
01:48:24,445 --> 01:48:27,234
He has every reason
to hide from his people.

1394
01:48:29,496 --> 01:48:31,081
Captured German news real
footage,

1395
01:48:31,800 --> 01:48:34,470
shows Soviet frontier troops
overwhelmed.

1396
01:48:34,964 --> 01:48:37,418
A retreat under fire in total confusion.

1397
01:48:41,591 --> 01:48:43,433
Whole formations surrendering.

1398
01:48:44,546 --> 01:48:48,696
Hundreds of thousands of men
entangled with fleeing civilians

1399
01:48:49,033 --> 01:48:51,456
in scenes of Biblical disorder.

1400
01:48:54,177 --> 01:48:57,928
Yet, there are some Soviet
citizens who welcome the invader.

1401
01:49:00,512 --> 01:49:03,427
To many in the Ukraine,
the arrival of the Germans

1402
01:49:03,519 --> 01:49:06,888
is a heaven sent opportunity
to throw off Stalin's yoke.

1403
01:49:08,168 --> 01:49:10,398
Local women bless the
Germans as they pass.

1404
01:49:21,050 --> 01:49:25,059
Their men folk destroy reminders of
a man who has terrorized them for years.

1405
01:49:35,379 --> 01:49:39,186
Stalin is above all stunned by the
shear speed of the German advance.

1406
01:49:40,978 --> 01:49:42,574
Still the Germans drive East.

1407
01:49:43,239 --> 01:49:46,294
They're at the outskirts of Kiev,
Smolensk, and Leningrad.

1408
01:49:57,598 --> 01:50:01,765
Yet fierce pockets of Red Army
resistance fight on behind enemy lines.

1409
01:50:04,822 --> 01:50:06,046
The fortress city of Brisk.

1410
01:50:11,421 --> 01:50:13,982
The besieged Red Army
garrison fights on and on,

1411
01:50:14,765 --> 01:50:17,781
for more than a month until they
are finally compelled to surrender.

1412
01:50:18,973 --> 01:50:21,676
Hitler is so impressed by the
tenacity of the Russian troops,

1413
01:50:22,228 --> 01:50:27,179
that he exercises rare clemency.
Only one survivor is shot.

1414
01:50:28,188 --> 01:50:31,149
The Political Officer at
the fortress Mikhail Fomin.

1415
01:50:32,380 --> 01:50:35,709
The Führer sights the defense
of Brest as an heroic effort.

1416
01:50:36,365 --> 01:50:38,189
An example to his own soldiers.

1417
01:50:41,477 --> 01:50:43,287
And he visits the fortress
with Mussolini,

1418
01:50:43,936 --> 01:50:45,960
to acknowledge a hard earned victory.

1419
01:50:49,164 --> 01:50:52,012
But for Stalin, the defenders
of Brest are not heroes.

1420
01:50:52,901 --> 01:50:55,613
Years later, after they're
released from German capture,

1421
01:50:56,388 --> 01:50:58,387
he will send
survivors to the Gulag.

1422
01:51:01,009 --> 01:51:04,623
The Wehrmacht's rapid relentless
advance seems unstoppable.

1423
01:51:06,511 --> 01:51:08,226
Traveling at up
to 50 miles a day,

1424
01:51:09,053 --> 01:51:12,323
Panzer divisions are already
approaching the heart of Stalin's empire.

1425
01:51:14,485 --> 01:51:15,585
And in the middle of July,

1426
01:51:16,193 --> 01:51:20,029
Stalin is forced to consider offering
the Germans a negotiated peace.

1427
01:51:21,102 --> 01:51:23,326
While Stalin contemplates
a way out of the war,

1428
01:51:24,082 --> 01:51:27,076
he is drawing up plans to punish
his own troops if they surrender.

1429
01:51:27,995 --> 01:51:32,595
In a desperate attempt to halt
the route, he issues order No. 270.

1430
01:51:33,568 --> 01:51:36,288
All officers and Political Officials
taken prisoner at the front,

1431
01:51:36,881 --> 01:51:38,176
are to be considered traitors.

1432
01:51:38,864 --> 01:51:40,610
If ever they return to the Soviet
Union,

1433
01:51:41,273 --> 01:51:43,593
they will be arrested and executed.

1434
01:51:48,840 --> 01:51:52,151
But the barbarity of order
270 does not stop there.

1435
01:51:54,198 --> 01:51:58,145
The wives of captured troops also
face imprisonment in the Gulag.

1436
01:52:02,777 --> 01:52:04,441
Hitler now forms the Einsatzgruppen
units for the necessry removal

1437
01:52:04,848 --> 01:52:06,465
of the die-hard Bolshevik leadership
and NKVD,

1438
01:52:06,896 --> 01:52:08,222
from all Soviet towns and cities.

1439
01:52:08,718 --> 01:52:09,987
However, on hearing of the German
invasion, many civilians

1440
01:52:10,435 --> 01:52:12,259
refuse to wait and take immediate
revenge on their Communist oppressors

1441
01:52:12,589 --> 01:52:14,066
and associated collaborators.

1442
01:52:46,520 --> 01:52:48,345
Meanwhile, Roosevelt extends the Land-Lease
Act, and sends more financial

1443
01:52:48,821 --> 01:52:50,885
and military aid to the Soviet Union

1444
01:52:51,316 --> 01:52:52,949
to help keep the Communist regime
in the war.

1445
01:52:53,686 --> 01:52:55,789
Stalin is now rumored to have
suffered a breakdown.

1446
01:53:06,508 --> 01:53:08,495
Now with Moscow in
range of the Luftwaffe,

1447
01:53:09,119 --> 01:53:12,743
Stalin's own citadel of power
comes directly under attack.

1448
01:53:13,855 --> 01:53:15,725
German Armies race for the Capital.

1449
01:53:16,957 --> 01:53:19,915
Elsewhere, army group
North heads for Leningrad.

1450
01:53:20,619 --> 01:53:23,546
Army group Center makes a
pincer movement towards Smolensk.

1451
01:53:24,179 --> 01:53:27,611
Army group South strikes
towards Kiev and the Ukraine.

1452
01:53:28,755 --> 01:53:31,307
The suburbs of Kiev,
the beginning of August.

1453
01:53:32,288 --> 01:53:37,904
In a fast pincer movement, German army
group South, threatens to encircle the city.

1454
01:53:39,046 --> 01:53:41,160
During August and the first
two weeks of September,

1455
01:53:41,854 --> 01:53:45,766
the Wehrmacht encircles a vast
area crammed with Red Army troops.

1456
01:53:46,624 --> 01:53:48,205
Four Soviet Armies parish.

1457
01:53:48,930 --> 01:53:51,272
On the 18th of
September the city falls.

1458
01:53:52,907 --> 01:53:55,302
The Führer is now lord
of all he surveys.

1459
01:53:56,134 --> 01:53:58,542
It seems as if he is on
course to meet his objective.

1460
01:53:59,030 --> 01:54:01,839
To crush Stalin's Russia
before winter sets in.

1461
01:54:01,874 --> 01:54:06,054
Leningrad lies ahead of the
Wehrmacht, defenseless.

1462
01:54:07,768 --> 01:54:09,495
As September draws to a close,

1463
01:54:10,430 --> 01:54:15,469
Leningrad is totally cut off with no
land link left to the Soviet Union.

1464
01:54:17,770 --> 01:54:19,271
At the end of September,

1465
01:54:19,371 --> 01:54:22,231
the Führer launches Operation
Typhoon,

1466
01:54:23,136 --> 01:54:25,366
the final drive alone the road
to Moscow.

1467
01:54:26,098 --> 01:54:29,396
14 German tank and 74 infantry
divisions,

1468
01:54:29,980 --> 01:54:32,697
a total of 1.8 million officers and men,

1469
01:54:32,732 --> 01:54:37,082
take part in the offensive.
Stalin has good cause for panic now.

1470
01:54:37,906 --> 01:54:41,002
Facing a disaster that might
sweep away the whole Soviet Union,

1471
01:54:41,569 --> 01:54:44,558
they have one last hope, that
the weather will save them.

1472
01:54:47,982 --> 01:54:51,158
Sleet is turning to snow.

1473
01:54:52,741 --> 01:54:56,452
The ground frozen at night is
now a quagmire during the day,

1474
01:54:56,585 --> 01:54:59,579
paralyzing Hitler's
overstretched war machine.

1475
01:55:00,857 --> 01:55:05,659
On the 2nd of December, German
units reach Krasnaya Polyana,

1476
01:55:05,759 --> 01:55:08,760
17 miles from the
center of Moscow.

1477
01:55:08,860 --> 01:55:13,311
As the weather intensifies
and temperatures plummet,

1478
01:55:13,411 --> 01:55:17,863
the bleak truth is time
turns decisively against them.

1479
01:55:20,215 --> 01:55:21,900
5 DAYS LATER...

1480
01:55:24,924 --> 01:55:27,461
AND AFTER 5 MONTHS OF US SANCTIONS...

1481
01:55:31,596 --> 01:55:32,908
PEARL HARBOUR, HAWAII
7 DECEMBER 1941

1482
01:55:32,943 --> 01:55:35,170
Two Army Privates running
the Opana radar station,

1483
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:37,771
are suddenly startled
by blips on the screen.

1484
01:55:37,871 --> 01:55:39,872
Fifty planes headed for Owahu.

1485
01:55:39,972 --> 01:55:44,574
Immediately they report the sightings
to the Army Operations Center.

1486
01:55:44,674 --> 01:55:47,858
They're dismissed as US planes
coming from the mainland.

1487
01:55:52,777 --> 01:55:55,719
Aircraft designated for the
second wave of the attack take off.

1488
01:55:55,778 --> 01:55:57,979
Messenger boy Tadao Fuchikami,

1489
01:55:58,079 --> 01:56:01,412
picks up General Marshall's urgent
cable for delivery to General Short.

1490
01:56:04,682 --> 01:56:07,860
Commander Fuchida's first
wave armada is on course.

1491
01:56:13,185 --> 01:56:16,586
Sleepy-eyed sailors and Marines,
their breakfast getting cold,

1492
01:56:16,686 --> 01:56:20,388
mistake the attack for some
crazy kind of air raid drill.

1493
01:56:20,488 --> 01:56:23,289
They think the
planes are American.

1494
01:56:24,990 --> 01:56:30,292
At 7:55 AM, dive bombers
hit Hickam and near airfields.

1495
01:56:35,094 --> 01:56:39,896
Two minutes later, torpedo planes
start their bomb on battleship row.

1496
01:56:42,096 --> 01:56:45,098
Three minutes later,
Zero's strafe other airbases.

1497
01:56:45,198 --> 01:56:51,000
It's Fuchida's first wave of aircraft that
hits the Arizona; she erupts like a volcano.

1498
01:56:56,302 --> 01:56:59,603
Flames burst 500 feet in the air.

1499
01:57:02,504 --> 01:57:06,306
Fuchida's deadly first waves
sinks the West Virginia.

1500
01:57:06,606 --> 01:57:07,907
Now, the Oklahoma,

1501
01:57:08,007 --> 01:57:13,008
a battle wagon moored outboard of the
US Maryland shutters with torpedo hits.

1502
01:57:13,108 --> 01:57:15,009
She begins listing...

1503
01:57:15,509 --> 01:57:17,410
and capsizes.

1504
01:57:17,510 --> 01:57:21,412
More torpedo's rip into the
battleships California and Nevada.

1505
01:57:25,713 --> 01:57:27,514
After the last bomb is dropped

1506
01:57:27,614 --> 01:57:31,816
the United States of America
virtually has a Pacific Fleet...

1507
01:57:31,916 --> 01:57:33,717
no longer.

1508
01:57:35,329 --> 01:57:37,552
Japan Attacks Pearl Harbor
And Then Declares War on U.S.

1509
01:57:41,920 --> 01:57:43,721
Yesterday,

1510
01:57:44,521 --> 01:57:49,523
December 7th, 1941,

1511
01:57:50,923 --> 01:57:55,925
A date which will live in infamy,

1512
01:57:56,425 --> 01:57:59,127
the United States of America

1513
01:57:59,327 --> 01:58:02,728
was suddenly and deliberately attacked

1514
01:58:02,828 --> 01:58:08,930
by Naval and Air Forces
of the Empire of Japan.

1515
01:58:11,985 --> 01:58:13,875
On 8 December 1941, the US declares
war on Japan

1516
01:58:14,347 --> 01:58:15,665
and officially enters World War Two.

1517
01:58:16,120 --> 01:58:17,883
Britain will declare war the
same day.

1518
01:58:23,291 --> 01:58:24,932
Was the attack really such a suprise?

1519
01:58:28,179 --> 01:58:29,861
JAPAN MAY STRIKE OVER WEEKEND

1520
01:58:33,564 --> 01:58:35,771
KURUSU BLUNTLY WARNED NATION
READY FOR BATTLE

1521
01:58:47,738 --> 01:58:49,592
To be continued

1522
01:59:01,323 --> 01:59:03,132
Part 9
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

1523
01:59:06,771 --> 01:59:08,619
1941 THE UKRAINE

1524
01:59:14,023 --> 01:59:16,323
We knew there was a war on.

1525
01:59:16,423 --> 01:59:17,723
By that time,

1526
01:59:17,823 --> 01:59:22,925
what was left of us was herded into
the cattle trains and shipped to Siberia.

1527
01:59:23,025 --> 01:59:27,125
That was literally a matter of
hours if not minutes until our turn.

1528
01:59:27,225 --> 01:59:32,227
And we were already sitting at the
railroad station - this was September 1941

1529
01:59:32,327 --> 01:59:35,227
when the German Army
overran the Ukraine,

1530
01:59:35,327 --> 01:59:40,128
and stopped the exiling; stopped
the trains. They stopped the trains.

1531
01:59:40,228 --> 01:59:44,629
And it was to us as if the
Lord had sent us the angels.

1532
01:59:44,729 --> 01:59:50,330
Here were people who stopped the
terror that had been upon us for 25 years.

1533
01:59:50,430 --> 01:59:52,731
Who came and opened
the churches for us

1534
01:59:52,831 --> 01:59:56,032
and said: "You can have
all the services you want".

1535
01:59:56,132 --> 01:59:57,632
It was like heaven.

1536
01:59:57,732 --> 02:00:01,933
My mother, to the day she
died, never stopped talking

1537
02:00:02,033 --> 02:00:06,434
about the wonderful 2 years that she
had when the German Army came.

1538
02:00:06,534 --> 02:00:09,334
They took over the
houses - we gave them gladly!

1539
02:00:09,434 --> 02:00:11,135
It was magnificent!

1540
02:00:11,235 --> 02:00:13,335
And we were absolutely convinced

1541
02:00:13,435 --> 02:00:16,736
that the Germans had come
to save us from Communism.

1542
02:00:16,836 --> 02:00:20,737
And never was there any reason for us
to change our minds - why should we?

1543
02:00:20,837 --> 02:00:23,137
The Germans were
heroes in our eyes.

1544
02:00:23,237 --> 02:00:25,438
We absolutely believed in Adolf Hitler,

1545
02:00:25,538 --> 02:00:31,139
we believed in the, in the nature of his
struggle, in the merits of his struggle.

1546
02:00:31,239 --> 02:00:34,940
We had these magnificent
German soldiers protecting us,

1547
02:00:35,040 --> 02:00:37,740
so the beginning was
not at all unpleasant.

1548
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:40,541
But then it became grim,
then the winter came.

1549
02:00:47,471 --> 02:00:48,823
On 11 December 1941, four days after the
Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour,

1550
02:00:49,203 --> 02:00:51,143
Hitler spoke to the Reichstag in Berlin
and dealt at lenght

1551
02:00:51,634 --> 02:00:53,304
with President Roosevelt hostile
policies toward Germany.

1552
02:00:53,898 --> 02:00:55,631
He detailed the increasingly belligernt
actions of Roosevelt's government,

1553
02:00:56,068 --> 02:00:57,259
and dramatically announced Germany
was now

1554
02:00:57,673 --> 02:00:59,055
joining Japan in the war
against the US.

1555
02:00:59,631 --> 02:01:02,733
Italy and Croatia would soon
follow suit.

1556
02:01:14,344 --> 02:01:15,977
The Independent State of Croatia,
commonly reffered to us the NDH,

1557
02:01:16,491 --> 02:01:17,760
is created 10 April 1941.
Led by Ante Paveliæ,

1558
02:01:18,180 --> 02:01:19,673
several hundred Ustae militia will
travel from training camps

1559
02:01:20,121 --> 02:01:21,918
in Italy to form the new government.

1560
02:01:22,732 --> 02:01:24,433
They will govern most of modern day
Croatia including Bosnia and Herzegovina,

1561
02:01:24,878 --> 02:01:26,819
and will seek to clear out ethnic
Serbs, Jews and Romany gypsies.

1562
02:01:27,481 --> 02:01:29,271
However, one third of all ethnic Serbs
will be spared death or deportation

1563
02:01:29,836 --> 02:01:31,885
by converting from Serbian Orthodox
to Roman Cathoic.

1564
02:01:32,956 --> 02:01:34,369
This is not dissimilar to what English
Protestants offered

1565
02:01:34,809 --> 02:01:36,471
the Catholics during the Middle Ages.

1566
02:01:46,687 --> 02:01:48,875
In Jerusalem, Hitler will ally with the
Grand Mufti Muhammad Haj Amin al-Husseini,

1567
02:01:49,593 --> 02:01:51,002
and together Croat and Muslim in
Bosnia form

1568
02:01:51,404 --> 02:01:53,689
the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of
the SS Handschar.

1569
02:01:55,496 --> 02:01:57,028
Few historians have ever asked
way so many foreigners

1570
02:01:57,433 --> 02:01:58,832
supported a supposedly "racist" Hitler.

1571
02:01:59,273 --> 02:02:00,856
The Arabs and the Japanese would
not be

1572
02:02:01,261 --> 02:02:03,598
the only non-Whites to fight
on the side of the Third Reich.

1573
02:02:05,297 --> 02:02:07,312
Africans, Slavs, Asians, Hindus, Arabs
and numerous other nationalities

1574
02:02:07,759 --> 02:02:09,675
all fought shoulder-to-shoulder
with Germans.

1575
02:02:11,452 --> 02:02:13,330
Hitler's Wehrmacht and Waffen SS
were in reality the most culturally,

1576
02:02:13,764 --> 02:02:15,819
ethnicaly and religiously diverse
military forces in Western history.

1577
02:02:39,978 --> 02:02:41,664
Ustae

1578
02:02:47,510 --> 02:02:49,644
With uncompromising hatred, fanatical
nationalism and die-hard religious beliefs

1579
02:02:50,088 --> 02:02:51,967
all in play, the horrors about to occur
in the Balkans are unparalleled.

1580
02:02:53,765 --> 02:02:55,371
Yugoslavia will become a war zone
of competing political interests

1581
02:02:55,798 --> 02:02:58,048
and disparate ideologies, including Socialism,
Fascism, Commuism, Monarchism,

1582
02:02:58,491 --> 02:03:00,468
and Serbian and Croatian nationalism.

1583
02:03:12,452 --> 02:03:14,481
It is well-documented and undeniable
that the fiercely nationalistic and fanatical

1584
02:03:14,855 --> 02:03:16,274
Croatian Ustae persecuted Jews.

1585
02:03:16,920 --> 02:03:18,340
Communists are perceived enemies
of the state,

1586
02:03:18,771 --> 02:03:20,647
holding them in camps such as
those at Jasenovac.

1587
02:03:21,613 --> 02:03:23,813
The Croats had been victims themselves
however, having suffered terriby

1588
02:03:24,249 --> 02:03:25,705
at the hands of the Serbs and
Bolshevik partisans.

1589
02:03:26,753 --> 02:03:28,425
Indeed, the Ustae's elite unit-
the Black Legion -

1590
02:03:28,881 --> 02:03:30,377
was formed on 3 Sptember 1941
by the Croat and Muslim survivors

1591
02:03:30,777 --> 02:03:32,291
who had fled Sarajevo after seeing
their families

1592
02:03:32,703 --> 02:03:34,405
butchred by Serbs and Chetniks.

1593
02:03:44,217 --> 02:03:45,881
They eventually earned a reputation
as the most brutal and ruthless

1594
02:03:46,794 --> 02:03:48,129
of Ustae units with a motto of...

1595
02:03:48,761 --> 02:03:50,262
"No quarter asked, none given."

1596
02:03:51,044 --> 02:03:52,819
Their finest hour came in the defence
of the town Kupres where,

1597
02:03:53,298 --> 02:03:54,883
although heavily outnumbered, they
and other Ustae units

1598
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:56,925
successfully defended the civilian
population against

1599
02:03:57,408 --> 02:03:59,440
four Communist partisan regiments,
preventing their certain death.

1600
02:04:00,303 --> 02:04:02,097
When the war ends, after successfuly
escaping the Communists,

1601
02:04:02,545 --> 02:04:04,367
hundreds of thousands of Croat soldiers
throw down their weapons

1602
02:04:04,871 --> 02:04:06,923
and surrender to the Western Allies
at the Austrian border town of Bleiburg.

1603
02:04:08,488 --> 02:04:10,136
However, the British Army will trick
the unarmed POWs and their families

1604
02:04:10,616 --> 02:04:12,430
into boarding trains supposedly
heading West.

1605
02:04:14,144 --> 02:04:15,999
The trains will instead trasport them
East, over the border to Yugoslavia,

1606
02:04:16,483 --> 02:04:18,354
and towards certain death at the hands
of the victorious partisans

1607
02:04:18,764 --> 02:04:20,194
led by Marshal Josip Tito.

1608
02:04:21,357 --> 02:04:22,998
On arrival, they are dragged from
the tranis and the men shot.

1609
02:04:23,409 --> 02:04:25,048
The women and children are forced
on foot to prison camps where,

1610
02:04:25,486 --> 02:04:27,853
along the way, many are raped,
beaten or murdered.

1611
02:04:29,065 --> 02:04:30,654
Hidden from the history books,
it is the worst massacre

1612
02:04:31,091 --> 02:04:32,875
of 20th century Europe, and became
known in Croatia as:

1613
02:04:34,528 --> 02:04:35,809
"The Bleiburg Massacre"

1614
02:04:57,978 --> 02:04:59,721
THE BATTLE OF MOSCOW

1615
02:05:01,996 --> 02:05:04,896
In the dark days of Autumn 1941,

1616
02:05:04,996 --> 02:05:08,347
the Summers' defeats have
decimated the Red Army,

1617
02:05:08,447 --> 02:05:11,798
and Hitler's artillery could
strike Moscow itself.

1618
02:05:13,098 --> 02:05:16,599
Soviet Union seems on
the brink of total defeat.

1619
02:05:16,999 --> 02:05:19,599
But Stalin has his back
to the wall

1620
02:05:19,699 --> 02:05:23,100
and he will stop at nothing
to protect his power base.

1621
02:05:26,101 --> 02:05:30,602
Hitler and the Allies, expect the
fall of Moscow at any moment.

1622
02:05:35,403 --> 02:05:38,237
In the capital, an agitated Stalin

1623
02:05:38,612 --> 02:05:40,755
entrusts the defense to general
Zhukov.

1624
02:05:42,904 --> 02:05:45,755
And it is his suggestion
at the end of November,

1625
02:05:45,855 --> 02:05:48,606
of a counter-attack against
the German pincers

1626
02:05:48,706 --> 02:05:53,807
that triggers hurried planning for a
massive Soviet counter-offensive.

1627
02:06:00,808 --> 02:06:07,009
It is a plan made possible by the seemingly
limitless depth of Red Army reserves.

1628
02:06:07,109 --> 02:06:08,915
His agent in Tokyo, Richard Sorge,

1629
02:06:09,439 --> 02:06:12,006
has sent word that Japan will
not as feared,

1630
02:06:12,511 --> 02:06:16,011
attack the USSR from Manchuria.

1631
02:06:18,312 --> 02:06:23,513
And for once, crucially, Stalin
trusts the advice of a minion.

1632
02:06:25,513 --> 02:06:28,700
He authorizes the transfer West
of more than half

1633
02:06:29,213 --> 02:06:31,027
the Soviet strength in the Far East.

1634
02:06:32,715 --> 02:06:38,316
17 fresh divisions, trained regulars
with full armored and artillery support,

1635
02:06:38,416 --> 02:06:41,242
that will form the heart
of the counter-attack.

1636
02:06:46,518 --> 02:06:50,419
The first days of December
are an agony of anticipation,

1637
02:06:50,519 --> 02:06:54,619
but on the 5th Zhukov unleashes
his armies.

1638
02:07:05,922 --> 02:07:10,523
Within 48 hours the Soviet
thrusts are fully underway.

1639
02:07:13,123 --> 02:07:17,924
Hitler's furious order to hold
advanced positions is meaningless.

1640
02:07:19,625 --> 02:07:24,220
The Red Army's new T-34 tanks are
rugged, powerful fighting machines

1641
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:28,916
designed to perform unfailingly in
the bitter cold of deepest Winter.

1642
02:07:29,327 --> 02:07:34,723
And swarms of specialist ski troops
are too fast for the ill-clad Wehrmacht.

1643
02:07:39,429 --> 02:07:43,330
German troops can only fall
back in astonished disarray.

1644
02:07:43,430 --> 02:07:48,793
As army groups enter, the juggernaut that
was to crush Moscow, is smashed apart.

1645
02:07:55,232 --> 02:07:57,879
After 6 months of catastrophic
defeats,

1646
02:07:58,373 --> 02:08:01,524
the Red Army's hard-fought victory
is undeniable.

1647
02:08:03,734 --> 02:08:05,258
And as the year closes,

1648
02:08:05,682 --> 02:08:07,809
Soviet towns and villages
west of the capital

1649
02:08:08,435 --> 02:08:11,542
are being freed from
their brief Nazi occupation.

1650
02:08:15,636 --> 02:08:17,970
There will be more sweeping Soviet
victories,

1651
02:08:18,395 --> 02:08:20,049
but none will burn more brightly

1652
02:08:20,237 --> 02:08:24,388
than this first astounding
recovery from the brink of defeat.

1653
02:08:29,039 --> 02:08:32,000
Convinced now that Germany
is on the brink of collapse,

1654
02:08:32,340 --> 02:08:35,341
Stalin demands attack after attack.

1655
02:08:36,541 --> 02:08:39,341
Every remaining reserve
is thrown into the fray

1656
02:08:39,441 --> 02:08:43,142
as he seeks to drive the
invader from Soviet territory.

1657
02:08:45,843 --> 02:08:47,643
But it is impossible.

1658
02:08:47,743 --> 02:08:50,130
Their superhuman effort has taken
its toll,

1659
02:08:51,614 --> 02:08:53,110
and the armies are exhausted.

1660
02:08:56,445 --> 02:08:59,746
Dissipated by Stalin's
overreaching ambition,

1661
02:08:59,846 --> 02:09:04,495
the offensives make only trivial
gains and at a dreadful cost.

1662
02:09:05,447 --> 02:09:08,848
And by the time its attacks
peter out in February,

1663
02:09:08,948 --> 02:09:13,416
the Red Army has lost almost a
million troops in the battle for Moscow.

1664
02:09:14,149 --> 02:09:18,928
That grim statistic will be hidden from
the Soviet people for half a century.

1665
02:09:25,851 --> 02:09:30,152
The majority of Wehrmacht units
may have escaped encirclement,

1666
02:09:30,252 --> 02:09:32,853
but they could not
save their equipment.

1667
02:09:33,553 --> 02:09:39,354
Now it lies abandoned everywhere;
a gigantic German scrapyard.

1668
02:09:51,457 --> 02:09:55,157
It is a fitting sight to show
British foreign minister Eden

1669
02:09:55,257 --> 02:09:57,587
when he arrives to
survey the battlefields.

1670
02:09:58,558 --> 02:10:01,897
For neither Britain nor Stalin's
new ally the United States

1671
02:10:02,159 --> 02:10:05,710
believed that Moscow could
survive the German onslaught.

1672
02:10:12,061 --> 02:10:17,662
But if the Western Allies are amazed,
this one victory has revealed to Stalin

1673
02:10:17,762 --> 02:10:23,363
a mirage of complete triumph and he
is totally committed to further attack.

1674
02:10:25,364 --> 02:10:27,464
But he has miscalculated.

1675
02:10:27,564 --> 02:10:29,465
The Wehrmacht is not yet beaten

1676
02:10:29,565 --> 02:10:34,066
and a furious Hitler is planning
massive new offensives.

1677
02:10:37,566 --> 02:10:42,667
His folly will again compel the Red
Army to fight in desperate defense.

1678
02:10:46,268 --> 02:10:49,373
And so the Soviet
people must struggle on.

1679
02:10:50,669 --> 02:10:53,403
It will be a long, painful journey

1680
02:10:53,885 --> 02:10:57,673
and many will not survive
to its conclusion.

1681
02:11:02,889 --> 02:11:04,577
RUSSIAN COSSACKS IN THE BALKANS

1682
02:11:08,292 --> 02:11:10,305
After the 1917 Russian Revolution,
the Communist Bolshevik regime brought

1683
02:11:10,690 --> 02:11:11,993
nothing but death and misery
to much of the population,

1684
02:11:12,445 --> 02:11:13,681
especially ethnic minorities.

1685
02:11:14,029 --> 02:11:15,325
One such oppresed group was
to rise up

1686
02:11:15,733 --> 02:11:16,936
and fight alongside the Germans.

1687
02:11:17,492 --> 02:11:19,192
With their reputation for toughness,
mobility and fearles fighting,

1688
02:11:19,535 --> 02:11:21,294
they are well-suited for the rugged
terrain of the Balkans.

1689
02:11:21,744 --> 02:11:23,318
Allocated to clear the region of
Communist partisans,

1690
02:11:23,554 --> 02:11:26,226
they are led by charismatic
German officer...

1691
02:11:28,081 --> 02:11:30,546
General Helmuth von Pannwitz

1692
02:11:48,748 --> 02:11:50,506
During oprations in Serbia and Croatia,
there occured a number of atrocities

1693
02:11:50,926 --> 02:11:52,726
against the civilian popuation, including
mass rapes and executions.

1694
02:11:56,994 --> 02:11:59,273
But an order by General von Panwitz
dated 20 October 1943

1695
02:11:59,649 --> 02:12:01,489
made it absolutey clear to all
under his command

1696
02:12:01,990 --> 02:12:03,371
that any crimes of such a nature
were to be punished by death.

1697
02:12:04,657 --> 02:12:06,664
On 11 May 1945, General von Pannwitz
surrender to the British Army

1698
02:12:07,160 --> 02:12:08,931
in allied-administred Austria,
after the Germans were assured

1699
02:12:09,490 --> 02:12:12,532
they would remain in the custody
of Western powers.

1700
02:12:23,744 --> 02:12:25,861
By mid-May it was becoming clear
that the Cossacks would be

1701
02:12:26,366 --> 02:12:28,918
sent back to the Soviet Union to face
execution of the Gulag prison camps.

1702
02:12:29,481 --> 02:12:31,152
This action will forever become
known as...

1703
02:12:31,864 --> 02:12:33,582
"The Betrayal of the Cossacks"

1704
02:12:43,650 --> 02:12:45,980
As a German national under the proection
of the Geneva Conventios,

1705
02:12:46,460 --> 02:12:49,448
General von Pannwitz was not subject
to banishmet to the Soviet Union.

1706
02:12:51,658 --> 02:12:52,792
Knowing full well the consequences,

1707
02:12:53,175 --> 02:12:54,998
he refused to abandon his Cossacks
comrades, stating:

1708
02:12:55,659 --> 02:12:57,587
"I was with the Cossacks in good times
and I will stay with them in bad times."

1709
02:12:59,111 --> 02:13:01,331
On 26 May, he was relieved of his
command and placed under arrest.

1710
02:13:01,890 --> 02:13:03,918
The British Army then set about
Cossacks onto railway trucks

1711
02:13:04,547 --> 02:13:05,705
by beating them with baseball
bats and rifle butts.

1712
02:13:06,198 --> 02:13:07,386
The fighting lasted for several days.

1713
02:13:08,245 --> 02:13:10,137
Eventually the British would deliver
to the Red Army around 40.000 Cossacks,

1714
02:13:10,527 --> 02:13:11,819
and with them their women and children.

1715
02:13:12,378 --> 02:13:14,193
Many are not even Soviet citizens,
and those who were not sent

1716
02:13:14,588 --> 02:13:16,122
to the Gulag are subequently executed.

1717
02:13:28,361 --> 02:13:31,327
General Helmuth von Pannwitz
was executed in Moscow on 16 January 1947.

1718
02:13:31,783 --> 02:13:33,475
He is to this day known by
the Cossacks as...

1719
02:13:34,097 --> 02:13:35,982
"The Last Knight of Europe"

1720
02:13:47,051 --> 02:13:48,719
"Betrayal of the Cossacks"

1721
02:14:03,467 --> 02:14:05,452
To be continued

1722
02:14:13,208 --> 02:14:15,656
Part 10
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

1723
02:14:19,823 --> 02:14:22,443
THE SOVIET UNION 1942

1724
02:14:23,475 --> 02:14:25,514
As the spring campaigning
season opens,

1725
02:14:26,202 --> 02:14:28,567
the Red Army's victories
of late 1941

1726
02:14:29,221 --> 02:14:31,085
seem suddenly meaningless.

1727
02:14:32,836 --> 02:14:35,156
A hasty Soviet attack in
the south against Kharkov

1728
02:14:35,885 --> 02:14:38,256
is swallowed up by a
German counteroffensive.

1729
02:14:50,712 --> 02:14:53,714
For Soviet soldiers, this
could so easily be the end.

1730
02:14:58,557 --> 02:15:00,581
Even Stalin's son
has been captured.

1731
02:15:01,191 --> 02:15:03,245
And his image on propaganda leaflets
Yakov Dzhugashvili

1732
02:15:03,577 --> 02:15:06,031
adds credence to German
claims of imminent victory.

1733
02:15:07,219 --> 02:15:11,087
And on the brink of catastrophe,
he resorts as always, to terror.

1734
02:15:13,672 --> 02:15:18,952
Stalin's secret order number 227,
issued under his signature in late July 1942.

1735
02:15:22,937 --> 02:15:27,687
This notorious document makes any
unauthorized retreat punishable by death.

1736
02:15:30,637 --> 02:15:34,235
Not one step back.
Stalin means it literally.

1737
02:15:36,160 --> 02:15:40,994
And this unique footage shows NKVD
troops putting his edict into practice.

1738
02:15:43,432 --> 02:15:44,984
They're known
as blocking units.

1739
02:15:46,807 --> 02:15:48,231
Deployed just behind the troops,

1740
02:15:48,714 --> 02:15:52,642
they pass instant sentence
on any who disobey order 227.

1741
02:15:53,702 --> 02:15:57,641
Enforcing the supreme commander's
will without hesitation or mercy.

1742
02:16:01,404 --> 02:16:03,485
Stalin will reject exchanging German
prisoners for the return of his son,

1743
02:16:03,884 --> 02:16:06,133
reportedly stating,
"I have no son named Yakov"

1744
02:16:06,907 --> 02:16:08,946
Yakov died in German captivity,
although the circumstances are unclear.

1745
02:16:09,329 --> 02:16:10,841
One account says he ran into
an electric fence

1746
02:16:11,151 --> 02:16:12,146
surrounding his POW camp.

1747
02:16:12,545 --> 02:16:14,095
Another, that he was shot
whilst trying to ecape.

1748
02:16:24,407 --> 02:16:26,407
The Führer is confident now,

1749
02:16:26,507 --> 02:16:32,310
certain that the Wehrmacht can seize
the vital oil centers of Grozny and Baku.

1750
02:16:32,410 --> 02:16:36,033
Two smaller German armies
have been advancing slowly east

1751
02:16:36,312 --> 02:16:39,613
towards the industrial
city of Stalingrad.

1752
02:16:40,414 --> 02:16:44,615
He sees a chance to cut all links
between Moscow and the Caucasus.

1753
02:16:44,715 --> 02:16:48,234
The city on the Volga
becomes his new prime target.

1754
02:16:52,816 --> 02:16:54,592
JAPAN AT WAR

1755
02:16:59,903 --> 02:17:01,681
After the bombing of Pearl Harbour,
the Japanese will now seek

1756
02:17:02,095 --> 02:17:03,571
to rid from the region the
domineering

1757
02:17:04,016 --> 02:17:05,534
Western powers of Britain
and United States.

1758
02:17:06,276 --> 02:17:07,691
On Christmas Day 1941, they capture
Hong Kong from British.

1759
02:17:08,195 --> 02:17:09,727
The Phiippines, Burma and
British Malaya

1760
02:17:10,120 --> 02:17:11,229
all fall in quick succession.

1761
02:17:11,699 --> 02:17:13,255
However, their greatest prize will be
the taking of the British

1762
02:17:13,694 --> 02:17:14,732
stronghold of Singpore.

1763
02:17:15,517 --> 02:17:17,297
Vastly outnumbered, 30.000 Japanese
troops force over 100.000 British,

1764
02:17:17,635 --> 02:17:19,328
Australian and Indian soldiers
to surrender.

1765
02:17:20,220 --> 02:17:22,238
It will be one of the most humiliating
defeats ever for the British Empire.

1766
02:17:35,963 --> 02:17:37,518
Winston Churchill describe the fall
of Singapore as...

1767
02:17:38,268 --> 02:17:41,231
"The worst disaster and largest
capitulation in British history."

1768
02:17:45,526 --> 02:17:47,043
Later, historians will point the
finger at Churchill himself

1769
02:17:47,425 --> 02:17:49,414
and blunder he made in
underestimating the Japanese.

1770
02:18:03,411 --> 02:18:03,515
Hours after surrendering to the
Japanese,

1771
02:18:03,912 --> 02:18:05,862
Austrlian-born Lieutenant General
Gordon Bennett and several of his officers

1772
02:18:06,301 --> 02:18:08,040
deserted their men and
absconded to Australia.

1773
02:18:09,766 --> 02:18:11,410
He was never given a major
position of command again.

BRITISH ASIA FLEET SMASHED

1778

Japanese Land at Guam:
Nippon Losses Insignificant

1779
02:18:57,503 --> 02:18:58,701
In 1942, at the height of its power,

1780
02:18:59,127 --> 02:19:01,055
the Japanese Empire ruled over an
area spanning 2.847.000 squre miles.

1781
02:19:01,525 --> 02:19:03,315
It was one of the largest maritime
empires in history.

1782
02:19:27,633 --> 02:19:29,571
JULY 1942

1783
02:19:29,987 --> 02:19:31,507
The Wehrmacht are at the gates
of Stalingrad.

1784
02:19:32,008 --> 02:19:33,704
An order from Stalin will prevent
civilians, even women and children,

1785
02:19:34,054 --> 02:19:35,236
from leaving the city.

1786
02:19:35,579 --> 02:19:37,032
His reasoning is that their presence
will encourage

1787
02:19:37,430 --> 02:19:39,205
greater resisance from the
city's defenders.

1788
02:19:45,295 --> 02:19:48,597
Stalingrad seems there
for the taking.

1789
02:19:54,299 --> 02:19:59,201
But this is Stalin's city, the very
symbol of his personal prestige.

1790
02:19:59,301 --> 02:20:04,204
And that is something even women
and children are expected to defend.

1791
02:20:09,806 --> 02:20:12,076
THE BATTLE OF STALINGRAD
23 AUGUST 1942

1792
02:20:49,924 --> 02:20:55,126
But when the thunder finally
abates, 50.000 lay dead.

1793
02:21:13,834 --> 02:21:18,408
Now, the Wehrmacht is moving
in to claim the rubble for its own.

1794
02:21:21,538 --> 02:21:23,639
As they inch through the suburbs,

1795
02:21:23,739 --> 02:21:27,886
German troops surely
expect a rapid conquest.

1796
02:21:31,242 --> 02:21:36,544
Instead, they are entering a savage
killing ground, for a duel to the death

1797
02:21:36,644 --> 02:21:39,860
that will rank among the most
terrible in human experience.

1798
02:21:43,447 --> 02:21:47,849
For at their approach the
ruins spring to furious life.

1799
02:21:54,552 --> 02:21:58,515
Soviet soldiers and citizens do
not even contemplate surrender.

1800
02:21:59,655 --> 02:22:02,602
A thousand desperate
battles erupt on the streets.

1801
02:22:02,856 --> 02:22:07,559
And a wild labyrinth of constantly
shifting front lines swamps the city.

1802
02:22:08,358 --> 02:22:12,773
The front line might be a house,
an alley, a tram line or a wall.

1803
02:22:18,963 --> 02:22:20,794
And every street is a minefield,

1804
02:22:21,218 --> 02:22:24,475
virtually impassible for tanks
or big guns.

1805
02:22:27,367 --> 02:22:30,453
So that soldiers, denied air
and artillery support,

1806
02:22:31,005 --> 02:22:32,479
must fight eyeball to eyeball,

1807
02:22:33,169 --> 02:22:37,660
lives hanging on their wits, their
battle skills and their cunning.

1808
02:22:39,972 --> 02:22:43,053
General Chuikov, in command
of the 62nd Army,

1809
02:22:43,558 --> 02:22:45,125
mounts a skillful campaign,

1810
02:22:45,475 --> 02:22:49,128
but his outnumbered troops
cannot hope to stop the Wehrmacht.

1811
02:22:53,578 --> 02:22:57,280
And by early November it has
cut a swath across Stalingrad,

1812
02:22:57,380 --> 02:23:00,181
splitting the 62nd Army in two.

1813
02:23:01,182 --> 02:23:02,911
In a last desperate gesture,

1814
02:23:03,359 --> 02:23:07,341
Chuikov mounts assault after assault
on the Mamayev ground,

1815
02:23:07,843 --> 02:23:11,611
a vital patch of high ground,
the very hub of the battle zone.

1816
02:23:12,087 --> 02:23:15,488
The hill changes hands
no less than eight times,

1817
02:23:15,588 --> 02:23:18,125
as Chuikov throws
everything into the fray.

1818
02:23:18,589 --> 02:23:24,192
And from the USA's Alaskan airfields,
fighter aircraft fly into Siberia

1819
02:23:24,292 --> 02:23:28,673
to aid a Red Army almost
ready to launch its counterstrike.

1820
02:23:29,194 --> 02:23:31,295
And on the
19th of November,

1821
02:23:31,395 --> 02:23:35,871
a huge artillery barrage by the
southwest front pierces the front.

1822
02:23:43,801 --> 02:23:48,803
And Yeryomenko's southern wing
surges forward on the next day.

1823
02:23:52,404 --> 02:23:56,689
The Wehrmacht, taken utterly
by surprise, cannot stop them.

1824
02:23:57,707 --> 02:24:00,308
And as its allies
collapse on the flanks,

1825
02:24:00,408 --> 02:24:04,188
there are no reserves to
stem the resurgent Red tide.

1826
02:24:05,910 --> 02:24:10,012
Within 3 days the Southwest
Front has taken Kalach,

1827
02:24:10,112 --> 02:24:13,214
some 80 kilometers
West of Stalingrad.

1828
02:24:16,015 --> 02:24:20,117
And on the 23rd of November,
a few miles southwest of Kalach,

1829
02:24:20,217 --> 02:24:23,315
its advanced units meet up
with Yeryomenko's forces.

1830
02:24:32,422 --> 02:24:36,624
Suddenly the German's Sixth
Army and the Fourth Panzer Army,

1831
02:24:36,724 --> 02:24:39,026
perhaps 300.000 of Hitler's finest
troops,

1832
02:24:39,478 --> 02:24:42,102
are surrounded inside Stalingrad.

1833
02:24:45,328 --> 02:24:48,503
The hunter has been
captured by his prey.

1834
02:24:53,631 --> 02:24:59,234
An astonished Hitler summons
Manstein, his troubleshooter, to Stalingrad.

1835
02:24:59,334 --> 02:25:02,335
Two Soviet armies, the
51st and Second guards,

1836
02:25:02,435 --> 02:25:06,517
are rushed to meet Manstein's relief
force and stop it dead in its tracks.

1837
02:25:07,137 --> 02:25:09,996
The guards pay a high
price for stopping Manstein.

1838
02:25:11,539 --> 02:25:14,323
Almost two-thirds of the
army is killed or wounded.

1839
02:25:15,641 --> 02:25:18,927
There will be no relief now
for German troops in Stalingrad.

1840
02:25:20,443 --> 02:25:21,454
The Luftwaffe tries,

1841
02:25:22,107 --> 02:25:24,894
but the Red Army brings up
extra AA batteries.

1842
02:25:25,345 --> 02:25:27,118
And the lumbering German transports

1843
02:25:27,451 --> 02:25:29,569
are blown out of the sky
in their hundreds.

1844
02:25:34,449 --> 02:25:36,846
Yet, like Soviet troops before them,

1845
02:25:37,501 --> 02:25:39,394
they entertain no thought
of surrender.

1846
02:25:40,252 --> 02:25:42,169
For ordinary
soldiers on both sides,

1847
02:25:42,553 --> 02:25:45,771
this is the ghastly climax
to a long, dark journey.

1848
02:25:50,757 --> 02:25:51,967
In the heart of the cauldron,

1849
02:25:52,570 --> 02:25:55,445
Hitler's gladiators know now
that they are doomed.

1850
02:25:59,560 --> 02:26:04,162
They evacuate a few casualties
on the last plane out of Stalingrad.

1851
02:26:05,763 --> 02:26:10,982
And with it go their last words
to families, lovers, friends.

1852
02:26:52,684 --> 02:26:54,055
But though they fight on,

1853
02:26:54,155 --> 02:26:55,527
the bullets are running out,

1854
02:26:56,319 --> 02:26:58,660
and the Red Army is still coming
at them.

1855
02:27:06,490 --> 02:27:09,192
Finally, after five long months,

1856
02:27:09,670 --> 02:27:12,899
a battle that began
almost by accident is over.

1857
02:27:20,330 --> 02:27:21,356
2 Feb 1943

1858
02:27:21,456 --> 02:27:23,812
Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus
surrenders to the Soviets.

1859
02:27:30,701 --> 02:27:32,397
300.000 German, Croatian, Hungarian,
Romanian and Italian soldiers,

1860
02:27:32,839 --> 02:27:34,623
including 35.000 Soviet volunteers
fighting the Communists,

1861
02:27:35,034 --> 02:27:36,435
had been surrouded.

1862
02:27:36,999 --> 02:27:39,453
Over 11.000 would refuse to lay
down their arms at the official surrender,

1863
02:27:39,840 --> 02:27:42,266
preferring instead a fight to
the death with the Bolsheviks.

1864
02:27:52,139 --> 02:27:54,276
By early March all pockets of
resistance had been wiped out.

1865
02:27:55,519 --> 02:27:57,332
Of those who remained, many will
freeze to death

1866
02:27:57,701 --> 02:27:59,085
on the forced marches East.

1867
02:27:59,552 --> 02:28:01,314
Others die from disease or mistreatmet,
or are worked to death

1868
02:28:01,754 --> 02:28:03,229
in the Gulag concenration camps.

1869
02:28:13,249 --> 02:28:14,490
Later, historians would confirm

1870
02:28:14,964 --> 02:28:17,286
that of the 11.237 letters sent by
soldiers in Stalingrad to their families,

1871
02:28:17,784 --> 02:28:19,976
almoust all expresed a willingess
to fight Communism

1872
02:28:20,418 --> 02:28:23,224
and die for National Socialism and
the Führer Adolf Hitler.

1873
02:28:33,837 --> 02:28:37,031
Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus was
held prisoner in the Soviet Union until 1952,

1874
02:28:37,448 --> 02:28:39,030
when he settled in Dresden,
East Germany.

1875
02:28:39,488 --> 02:28:41,031
He would spend the remainder of
his days

1876
02:28:41,417 --> 02:28:43,548
defending his actions at Stalingrad.

1877
02:28:44,326 --> 02:28:45,793
Later he would be quoted as saying...

1878
02:28:46,247 --> 02:28:48,161
Communism was the best hope
for postwar Europe.

1879
02:28:48,947 --> 02:28:50,379
In 1955, only 6.000 of an estimated

1880
02:28:50,732 --> 02:28:52,732
90.000 prisoners or more
would return home.

1881
02:29:01,477 --> 02:29:03,733
Stlingrad would prove to be
a turning point in the war.

1882
02:29:14,468 --> 02:29:15,859
To be continued

1883
02:29:18,795 --> 02:29:20,737
Part 11
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

1884
02:29:26,554 --> 02:29:27,399
From early February,

1885
02:29:27,975 --> 02:29:31,337
Stalin orders new offensives
all along the southern fronts.

1886
02:29:33,459 --> 02:29:35,538
Though they have fought and
survived the Battle of Stalingrad,

1887
02:29:36,244 --> 02:29:38,341
their commanders can
permit them no rest.

1888
02:29:39,824 --> 02:29:42,688
Instead they must struggle on
through the late winter blizzards,

1889
02:29:43,332 --> 02:29:46,519
instruments of their supreme
commander's lust for glory.

1890
02:29:48,467 --> 02:29:52,686
The Red Army drives deep into Nazi
held territories fighting exhaustion,

1891
02:29:52,917 --> 02:29:56,870
cold, mud. Inch by inch
the infantry advances.

1892
02:30:04,836 --> 02:30:07,085
The Führer knows that if his
stretched forces

1893
02:30:07,461 --> 02:30:09,815
are to defeat the Red Army
in 1943,

1894
02:30:10,255 --> 02:30:11,650
they must attack quickly

1895
02:30:12,075 --> 02:30:14,603
before it can recover
from the losses of the winter.

1896
02:30:15,406 --> 02:30:18,338
Hitler's strategy is simple
and optimistic.

1897
02:30:19,718 --> 02:30:21,053
In a two-pronged attack,

1898
02:30:21,463 --> 02:30:24,516
he plans to destroy the Soviet
position around Kursk.

1899
02:30:24,894 --> 02:30:29,102
On the map, a great bulge 130
miles long and 100 miles deep

1900
02:30:29,659 --> 02:30:31,336
at the center of the eastern front.

1901
02:30:35,408 --> 02:30:39,079
And so now, two gigantic
armies are converging.

1902
02:30:39,830 --> 02:30:43,374
The greatest tank battle
of all time is about to begin.

1903
02:30:43,722 --> 02:30:45,320
THE BATTLE OF KURSK

1904
02:33:01,662 --> 02:33:04,036
The great barrage of Katyusha rockets
and artillery

1905
02:33:04,894 --> 02:33:07,991
announces counteroffensives
by 4 more Soviet armies

1906
02:33:08,572 --> 02:33:12,301
sweeping around the rear
of the battered German divisions.

1907
02:34:12,856 --> 02:34:14,551
German offensive operations
are halted.

1908
02:34:15,524 --> 02:34:17,668
The Wehrmacht can only retreat.

1909
02:34:18,402 --> 02:34:20,881
It leaves behind the
mangled debris of war.

1910
02:34:25,156 --> 02:34:28,344
Battle zones littered with
charred and broken tanks,

1911
02:34:28,792 --> 02:34:31,286
and the bodies of hundreds
of thousands of men.

1912
02:34:42,717 --> 02:34:46,707
For survivors of this savage
inferno, shattered, shell-shocked,

1913
02:34:47,123 --> 02:34:50,489
stunned by the horrors they have
witnessed, there can be no joy.

1914
02:34:54,470 --> 02:34:56,038
The Battle of Kursk
5 July 1943- 23 August 1943

1915
02:34:56,690 --> 02:34:58,346
Outnumbered by more that two to one,

1916
02:34:58,711 --> 02:35:00,770
the Germans suffer casualties of
around 203.000. whilst Communist losses

1917
02:35:01,452 --> 02:35:02,597
amount to some 803.000.

1918
02:35:03,117 --> 02:35:04,978
The Germans however failed
to achieve their goal.

1919
02:35:06,060 --> 02:35:08,301
With the US opening a new front
in Italy, after the batle of Kursk,

1920
02:35:08,830 --> 02:35:10,896
never again will Germany regain
the initiative.

1921
02:35:25,685 --> 02:35:27,783
The Germans will now fight a rearguard
action in freezing weather conditions,

1922
02:35:28,263 --> 02:35:30,223
and at the same time offer much-needed
protection to refugees fleeing

1923
02:35:30,674 --> 02:35:32,179
the rampaging Communists.

1924
02:35:49,939 --> 02:35:53,697
"1943 the story changed and
the Germans were pushed back.

1925
02:35:54,361 --> 02:35:59,371
And in the pushback they moved
us with them, and we went willingly.

1926
02:36:01,951 --> 02:36:04,750
There was no moving at gunpoint.

1927
02:36:04,850 --> 02:36:06,250
Had we stayed back

1928
02:36:06,350 --> 02:36:07,922
the Communists would have
taken us and executed us

1929
02:36:08,283 --> 02:36:09,590
or shipped us to Siberia.

1930
02:36:10,061 --> 02:36:13,491
So we very willingly retreated
with the Germans.

1931
02:36:17,872 --> 02:36:19,275
Food was getting short.

1932
02:36:19,594 --> 02:36:20,753
The horses were getting sick.

1933
02:36:21,969 --> 02:36:23,227
The road was getting narrow.

1934
02:36:23,625 --> 02:36:25,026
It was extremely cold.

1935
02:36:25,382 --> 02:36:28,982
When I think of the war, I do not
think of hunger so much as of cold.

1936
02:36:29,514 --> 02:36:31,497
It was always, always cold.

1937
02:36:38,679 --> 02:36:43,237
And then of course once the winter
came, it became harder and harder.

1938
02:36:43,990 --> 02:36:47,585
We had to often stay
overnight in strange houses.

1939
02:36:48,605 --> 02:36:52,063
The army would confiscate houses,
would put the refugees there.

1940
02:36:52,441 --> 02:36:54,154
The army protected
us to the end.

1941
02:36:55,008 --> 02:36:59,865
The army never, ever let us down.
NEVER let us down, to the very end."

1942
02:37:00,246 --> 02:37:06,345
¶ And the snow fell,
covering the dreams and ideals.

1943
02:37:06,826 --> 02:37:13,829
¶ And the snow fell,
freezing the blood and the wheels.

1944
02:37:14,202 --> 02:37:21,583
¶ And the snow fell,
they had to keep warm for survival.

1945
02:37:21,683 --> 02:37:29,065
¶ And the snow fell,
and defeated the beast's only rival.

1946
02:37:31,544 --> 02:37:37,571
¶ They took the old roads that
Napoleon had taken before.

1947
02:37:39,144 --> 02:37:45,985
¶ They fought as the forces of light
against the darkness in a holy war.

1948
02:37:47,088 --> 02:37:53,137
¶ One day they were looking around
at the sun shining on the cold flowers.

1949
02:37:54,317 --> 02:38:00,393
¶ The next day they were freezing to death
in the snow and the ice cold showers.

1950
02:38:00,806 --> 02:38:07,794
¶ And the snow fell,
covering the dreams and ideals.

1951
02:38:08,202 --> 02:38:15,183
¶ And the snow fell,
freezing the blood and the wheels.

1952
02:38:15,645 --> 02:38:22,020
¶ And the snow fell,
they had to keep warm for survival.

1953
02:38:22,651 --> 02:38:29,986
¶ And the snow fell,
and defeated the beast's only rival."

1954
02:38:36,255 --> 02:38:37,884
PARTISANS - THE RED TEROR

1955
02:38:40,940 --> 02:38:45,339
This secret partisan report
declassified for this program

1956
02:38:45,539 --> 02:38:48,739
complains that amongst
one large partisan division.

1957
02:38:48,839 --> 02:38:53,005
Drunkenness, robbery, beatings
and rape are universal occurrences.

1958
02:38:56,639 --> 02:38:58,722
The widespread terror
wrought by the partisans

1959
02:38:59,007 --> 02:39:01,597
was not a story the Communists
wished to tell after the war.

1960
02:39:05,756 --> 02:39:08,266
This rare archive shows a
woman hanged by the partisans

1961
02:39:08,658 --> 02:39:10,888
and displayed to the rest of
the population as a warning.

1962
02:39:19,637 --> 02:39:22,909
These film rushes, never shown
to the German public during the war,

1963
02:39:23,811 --> 02:39:27,084
reveal Soviet mutilation
of German prisoners.

1964
02:39:35,936 --> 02:39:39,739
Actions like these only served to
escalate the level of the German reprisal.

1965
02:39:42,441 --> 02:39:43,641
During our retreat we found
20 soldiers...

1966
02:39:44,736 --> 02:39:46,808
... murderer in the most bestial
manner

1967
02:39:47,545 --> 02:39:51,142
Their ears were cut off, their eyes
gouged out, their genitals cut off

1968
02:39:53,295 --> 02:39:56,466
Naturaly, we felt enormous rage

1969
02:40:15,334 --> 02:40:18,898
The partisans became a growing
problem for the German occupiers.

1970
02:40:18,998 --> 02:40:22,562
If the Germans suspected a village
had been used as a partisan base,

1971
02:40:23,333 --> 02:40:25,702
then it was common practice
to burn it to the ground.

1972
02:40:26,332 --> 02:40:28,433
"And we burned the houses.

1973
02:40:28,533 --> 02:40:30,133
On the one hand I
didn't regret it too much

1974
02:40:30,233 --> 02:40:32,246
because I knew what was
is worth a Russian house?

1975
02:40:33,033 --> 02:40:33,972
They are so primitive anyhow.

1976
02:40:34,633 --> 02:40:38,401
Not comparable to a German house or an
English house or French house, or so on.

1977
02:40:39,233 --> 02:40:43,151
Not at all. But all in all, there's not
much value in it, in such a house.

1978
02:40:43,831 --> 02:40:45,698
They would survive.
That was my feeling."

1979
02:40:57,650 --> 02:40:59,589
In Britain, they have forged
a sword,

1980
02:41:00,300 --> 02:41:03,379
a gift to the victor of Stalingrad
from King George.

1981
02:41:05,030 --> 02:41:06,518
Earlier, in 1943,

1982
02:41:07,150 --> 02:41:11,395
at Katyn forest near Smolensk,
German occupying authorities

1983
02:41:11,694 --> 02:41:15,337
had unearthed the mass graves
of 20.000 Polish officers.

1984
02:41:18,329 --> 02:41:21,730
International observers were
invited to support Berlin's claim

1985
02:41:22,253 --> 02:41:24,841
that the murders were
carried out by the NKVD.

1986
02:41:25,285 --> 02:41:29,690
But Stalin had reacted furiously,
denying any link with the massacres.

1987
02:41:33,388 --> 02:41:35,146
But when Allied leaders meet
in Teheran,

1988
02:41:35,902 --> 02:41:38,991
Churchill and Roosevelt back their
most important ally

1989
02:41:39,430 --> 02:41:42,902
in the face of outraged protest
from exiled Poles.

1990
02:41:45,125 --> 02:41:46,364
His sword is presented,

1991
02:41:46,932 --> 02:41:50,211
and Stalin stands as an undisputed
world leader.

1992
02:41:52,733 --> 02:41:54,301
THE KATYN MASSACRE

1993
02:41:54,427 --> 02:41:57,769
In March 1940, in a forest near
Katyn village,

1994
02:41:58,283 --> 02:42:00,771
eight huge pits were dug.

1995
02:42:01,327 --> 02:42:03,129
Heavy trucks brought in people.

1996
02:42:03,653 --> 02:42:07,628
They were Polish Army
Reservists, Doctors, Engineers.

1997
02:42:08,739 --> 02:42:12,425
The Soviets carried out massacres
on a regular basis.

1998
02:42:12,637 --> 02:42:16,037
Riga, Tartu, Lviv, Minsk.

1999
02:42:17,043 --> 02:42:19,400
Relatives could not identify
many of the corpses.

2000
02:42:20,315 --> 02:42:23,648
Horrific torture had
made them unrecognizable.

2001
02:42:24,668 --> 02:42:27,767
The Soviet Union meanwhile
had become an Allied power.

2002
02:42:28,836 --> 02:42:32,792
The Soviet officers who pulled
out fingernails, cut tongues,

2003
02:42:33,235 --> 02:42:35,979
and perforated the skulls
of their victims with nails...

2004
02:42:37,121 --> 02:42:39,496
WERE PAID WITH WESTERN AID!

2005
02:42:41,324 --> 02:42:45,363
The British War Crimes Act gives them
immunity from prosecution in Britain,

2006
02:42:46,179 --> 02:42:51,165
because war crimes by definition
were committed only by the Germans.

2007
02:42:51,551 --> 02:42:52,615
According to the
1991 BRITISH WAR CRIMECAST

2008
02:42:53,015 --> 02:42:54,807
War crimes by definition were commited
ONLY by the Germans.

2009
02:43:00,439 --> 02:43:02,486
In 2012 the World Press reported their
recent findings on the Katun Massacre.

2010
02:43:03,447 --> 02:43:05,456
According to documets published Sepember
2012 by US National Archives

2011
02:43:06,049 --> 02:43:07,857
and Records Administration, the US
received coded reports in 1943

2012
02:43:08,360 --> 02:43:10,759
from two of its officers taken by
they German captors to the Katyn Forest.

2013
02:43:12,539 --> 02:43:14,306
Though the messeges of the US
officers reached Washigton,

2014
02:43:14,905 --> 02:43:16,714
they disappeared soon thereafter.

2015
02:43:20,050 --> 02:43:21,982
It has long been suspected that President
Roosevelt and Prime Minister Winston Churchill

2016
02:43:22,518 --> 02:43:24,682
knew that Soviet leader Joseph Stalin
has ordered the massacre.

2017
02:43:40,829 --> 02:43:42,828
One thing the World Press forgot
to mention...

2018
02:43:52,523 --> 02:43:54,738
Adolf Hitler is now officially exonerated
of Katyn Massacre.

2019
02:44:04,904 --> 02:44:06,503
To be continued

2020
02:44:11,137 --> 02:44:13,034
Part 12
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

2021
02:44:18,819 --> 02:44:20,522
On 25 July 1943, Italien leader Benito
Mussolini is overthrown and imprisoned.

2022
02:44:20,995 --> 02:44:22,566
Over the next few weeks he will be held
in several top secret locations

2023
02:44:22,950 --> 02:44:24,908
on the orders of the new
Italien government.

2024
02:44:27,342 --> 02:44:28,918
A hand-picked SS squadron, along with
members of Luftwaffe,

2025
02:44:29,684 --> 02:44:30,992
are given the task of finding and
rescuing him

2026
02:44:31,364 --> 02:44:32,719
before he can be handed
over to the US.

2027
02:44:33,197 --> 02:44:34,917
Hitler had personally interviewed three
men to led squadron.

2028
02:44:35,453 --> 02:44:37,072
The men he chose was...
Captain Otto Skorzeny.

2029
02:44:42,907 --> 02:44:45,573
With time runing out, Mussolini's whereabouts
are finaly discovered at Campo Imperatore

2030
02:44:45,949 --> 02:44:47,220
high in the Apennine Mountains
of Italy.

2031
02:44:47,629 --> 02:44:49,629
The plan is to land the commando unit
there and assault it.

2032
02:44:51,220 --> 02:44:53,491
German military expert warn Hitler
of the high probability of failure

2033
02:44:53,835 --> 02:44:55,435
and to expect an 80 % casaulty rate.

2034
02:44:56,092 --> 02:44:57,735
The codename for the mission is
Operation Oak.

2035
02:45:14,141 --> 02:45:17,339
The 12th of September
1943, central Italy.

2036
02:45:18,065 --> 02:45:19,853
High above Mount Gran Sasso.

2037
02:47:48,780 --> 02:47:50,571
The most daring and spectacular raid
of World War Two was completed

2038
02:47:50,979 --> 02:47:52,789
in just 12 minutes without a
single shot being fired.

2039
02:47:55,556 --> 02:47:56,846
Captain Skorzeny greeted Mussolini
with now immortal words...

2040
02:47:57,606 --> 02:47:59,295
"Duce, the Furer has sent me
to set you free!"

2041
02:48:00,806 --> 02:48:01,518
To which Mussolini replied...

2042
02:48:01,898 --> 02:48:03,543
"I knew that my friend would not
forsake me!"

2043
02:48:04,535 --> 02:48:06,081
On his return, Captain Skorzeny was
promoted by Hitler to the rank of Major

2044
02:48:06,482 --> 02:48:08,289
and awarded the Knight's Cross of the
Iron Cross with Oak Leaves,

2045
02:48:09,441 --> 02:48:11,082
the highest order a German military
officer could obtain.

2046
02:48:13,310 --> 02:48:14,930
Mussolini awarded him the
Order of 100 Musketeers.

2047
02:48:16,209 --> 02:48:18,497
The Allies would come to know Skorzeny
as the most dangerous man in Europe.

2048
02:48:32,006 --> 02:48:33,848
At the Nuremberg Trials, Skorzeny was
accused of war crimes but acquitted.

2049
02:48:34,231 --> 02:48:35,543
Whilst awaiting a further trial,
he escaped to Spain.

2050
02:48:37,513 --> 02:48:38,953
He then moved to Argentina but return
to establish a successful

2051
02:48:39,356 --> 02:48:41,426
construction company that would
make him a multi-millionaire.

2052
02:48:42,600 --> 02:48:44,889
Otto Skorzeny finally succumbed to
cancer on 5 July 1975, aged 67 in Madrid.

2053
02:48:46,449 --> 02:48:47,863
His ashes were later flown to Viena,
Austria to be interred

2054
02:48:47,933 --> 02:48:49,899
in the Skorzeny family plot at
Döblinger Friedhof.

2055
02:49:08,864 --> 02:49:10,537
OTTO SKORZENY
The most dangerous man in Europe.

2056
02:49:15,258 --> 02:49:18,180
1943 OPERATION GOMORRAH

2057
02:49:21,988 --> 02:49:29,029
On Saturday, July 24th, 792 RAF bombers
readied for a night attack on Hamburg.

2058
02:49:31,430 --> 02:49:35,259
Each loaded with tons of high
explosives and incendiary bombs.

2059
02:49:38,258 --> 02:49:42,578
It was the first of a series of attacks
that would continue for an entire week,

2060
02:49:43,984 --> 02:49:46,821
codenamed
Operation Gomorrah.

2061
02:49:53,540 --> 02:49:54,719
By 1943, the US had finally rearmed
the British.

2062
02:49:55,172 --> 02:49:57,103
Now the countries of Capitalism and
Communism and those they dominate,

2063
02:49:57,462 --> 02:49:59,235
will combine to seek the total annihilation
one of most advanced civilisation

2064
02:49:59,682 --> 02:50:00,889
the world had ever seen.

2065
02:50:01,559 --> 02:50:03,045
Under National Socialism,

2066
02:50:03,542 --> 02:50:05,276
Germany in a few short years
had arisen

2067
02:50:05,311 --> 02:50:06,843
from financial ruin and social
degradation,

2068
02:50:07,192 --> 02:50:09,082
to lead Europe in science, technology
art and literature.

2069
02:50:09,586 --> 02:50:10,906
It will now be surrounded.

2070
02:50:11,700 --> 02:50:13,586
The Germany wil eventually be attacked
by over 50 countries

2071
02:50:13,995 --> 02:50:15,594
led by the Soviet Union, Britain
and the US.

2072
02:50:17,135 --> 02:50:18,415
Over Hamburg, the Americans will
strategically bomb

2073
02:50:18,838 --> 02:50:20,484
industrial plants during the day,
whilst the British will purposely

2074
02:50:20,890 --> 02:50:22,758
target civilians at night, aiming at
the tighty-knit houses

2075
02:50:23,302 --> 02:50:24,673
of the working class communities.

2076
02:50:26,349 --> 02:50:28,085
In what was a heious and barbaric
war crime of epic proportions,

2077
02:50:28,583 --> 02:50:30,534
insigned by Churchill and RAF Commander
Arthur "Bomber" Harris,

2078
02:50:31,095 --> 02:50:32,981
over 50.000 will be incinerated in the
ensuing firestorm

2079
02:50:33,509 --> 02:50:35,604
that will become known as
Germany's "Hiroshima".

2080
02:50:39,128 --> 02:50:40,636
The Allies exepect the war
to be over by Christmas,

2081
02:50:41,184 --> 02:50:43,186
confident that the firebombing
of other cities will force the Germans

2082
02:50:43,643 --> 02:50:45,667
to turn over Adolf Hitler
and the Third Reich.

2083
02:50:48,545 --> 02:50:50,235
Yet, no matter how many bombs
Allies drop on German cities,

2084
02:50:50,683 --> 02:50:52,935
there will never be a hint of
an upraising against Führer.

2085
02:50:56,408 --> 02:50:59,163
"People were sitting there
in the cellar trembling,

2086
02:50:59,548 --> 02:51:03,658
and we saw the walls shivering.

2087
02:51:04,243 --> 02:51:06,416
As it was, but trembling,
and...

2088
02:51:08,071 --> 02:51:09,999
those nights we can never
forget in our lives.

2089
02:51:10,287 --> 02:51:11,533
I cannot forget it ever.

2090
02:51:13,695 --> 02:51:16,689
We asked ourselves, why are
they doing this to our Führer?

2091
02:51:16,716 --> 02:51:19,131
And we were told by everyone,

2092
02:51:19,523 --> 02:51:21,810
because they hated the Führer.

2093
02:51:22,051 --> 02:51:24,794
Because the Führer wanted
to create a better world.

2094
02:51:26,817 --> 02:51:28,969
Maybe Churchill and Roosevelt

2095
02:51:29,579 --> 02:51:32,517
thought they could demoralize
the German people with bombing?

2096
02:51:33,156 --> 02:51:37,884
And make them surrender?
But he reached the opposite of it."

2097
02:52:12,743 --> 02:52:15,341
In the aftermath of the firestorm,

2098
02:52:15,688 --> 02:52:18,365
almost a million refugees
fled Hamburg

2099
02:52:18,971 --> 02:52:21,112
and took with them stories
of the most terrible

2100
02:52:22,040 --> 02:52:23,517
horror that they'd witnessed.

2101
02:52:24,030 --> 02:52:26,116
This caused a panic across Germany,

2102
02:52:26,627 --> 02:52:29,265
which was unlike anything that
they'd ever experienced before.

2103
02:52:31,774 --> 02:52:35,551
In the aftermath of the Hamburg attacks,
the American and British commanders

2104
02:52:35,966 --> 02:52:38,781
remained committed to their
sharply divergent strategies.

2105
02:52:41,078 --> 02:52:44,342
Eaker continued to press precision
attacks on industrial targets.

2106
02:52:44,853 --> 02:52:45,740
Major General
Ira C. Eaker

2107
02:52:46,870 --> 02:52:49,317
Harris championed the bombing of cities.
Air Chief Marshal Arthur "Bomber" Harris

2108
02:52:49,940 --> 02:52:52,745
And the city he was
focused on - Berlin.

2109
02:52:52,776 --> 02:52:53,453
OPERATION "THUNDERCLAP"

2110
02:52:54,981 --> 02:52:56,509
the total devastation of the
center of Berlin

2111
02:53:01,063 --> 02:53:02,855
THE RED TERROR MOVES WEST

2112
02:53:05,335 --> 02:53:09,112
Stalin's military troikas come in
the wake of the resurgent Red Army.

2113
02:53:10,487 --> 02:53:13,086
They tour a land scorched
by the departing Germans,

2114
02:53:13,717 --> 02:53:15,356
convening kangaroo courts

2115
02:53:15,729 --> 02:53:19,706
to purge partisan units
of nationalists, anti-Communists.

2116
02:53:29,931 --> 02:53:32,477
There is no hiding place for
Nazi collaborators.

2117
02:53:33,107 --> 02:53:35,762
The white card of betrayal hangs
round their necks

2118
02:53:36,107 --> 02:53:37,761
as they pay the price of treason.

2119
02:53:47,322 --> 02:53:50,062
There is no pity for the young boys
who flocked in innocence

2120
02:53:50,392 --> 02:53:51,649
to join the Hitler Youth.

2121
02:53:53,178 --> 02:53:55,571
His desperate plea for clemency
will be in vain.

2122
02:54:12,446 --> 02:54:14,277
THE FLIGHT FROM COMMUNISM

2123
02:54:22,373 --> 02:54:24,140
As the Communists begin to recapture
territories formerly occupied by the Germans,

2124
02:54:24,634 --> 02:54:26,274
more and more refugees flee West
in a desperate bid to rich safety.

2125
02:54:30,737 --> 02:54:33,183
However, the exodus bring with it
poverly, over-crowding and malnutrition.

2126
02:54:33,671 --> 02:54:35,646
These conditions are the perfect breedig
ground for what has become known

2127
02:54:36,204 --> 02:54:38,084
over the centuries as the
"war disease"... typhus.

2128
02:54:41,306 --> 02:54:42,591
A typhus epidemic had already
broken out

2129
02:54:43,096 --> 02:54:44,885
during the summer of 1942
at the Auschwitz-Birkenau POW camp,

2130
02:54:45,357 --> 02:54:47,187
when between 1-19 August, over
4.000 deaths were registered,

2131
02:54:47,682 --> 02:54:49,341
at an average of 216
prisoers a day.

2132
02:54:50,442 --> 02:54:52,197
The Germans managed to save
thousands during the outbreak

2133
02:54:52,646 --> 02:54:54,612
using pesticide Zyklon B,
but the disease is so deadly

2134
02:54:55,021 --> 02:54:56,678
that the victim's clothing had to
be removed after death

2135
02:54:57,155 --> 02:54:59,112
and burned to destroy the
typhus-bearing lice.

2136
02:54:59,297 --> 02:55:01,499
In 1943, potentially devastating epidemics
in Sicily and throughout Italy

2137
02:55:01,908 --> 02:55:03,780
were only averted by cocerted American
delousing campaign

2138
02:55:04,364 --> 02:55:07,128
using the recenty-invented compound
called DDT.

2139
02:55:27,672 --> 02:55:31,542
"Germany at that time already
was besieged by 51 countries,

2140
02:55:31,838 --> 02:55:33,309
they were struggling for their lives.

2141
02:55:33,637 --> 02:55:34,660
And they took us in.

2142
02:55:37,754 --> 02:55:41,761
We were all put into what
looked like a great big bathroom.

2143
02:55:42,171 --> 02:55:45,747
And what happened eventually is
that they rained soap and water on us.

2144
02:55:46,099 --> 02:55:48,908
And the reason for that was
that we had to be deloused.

2145
02:55:49,234 --> 02:55:50,919
We were so full of lice.

2146
02:55:51,935 --> 02:55:55,175
So, when I hear about the shower heads
in the Holocaust, and all of that,

2147
02:55:55,519 --> 02:55:56,429
I know exactly what it was.

2148
02:55:56,755 --> 02:55:59,747
That was soap and water
raining down on us to delouse us.

2149
02:56:00,200 --> 02:56:01,393
To wash us down like dogs.

2150
02:56:04,202 --> 02:56:05,470
The same for the cutting of hair.

2151
02:56:05,816 --> 02:56:10,215
I mean we were all shorn
bald in order to stop the lice.

2152
02:56:10,515 --> 02:56:12,016
Everybody had lice in the war,

2153
02:56:12,377 --> 02:56:14,032
and this was just common
knowledge.

2154
02:56:17,006 --> 02:56:20,699
We considered ourselves lucky
if we could ride those cattle cars.

2155
02:56:21,118 --> 02:56:24,043
And yes, they were crammed full of
people, and yes it was very difficult,

2156
02:56:25,041 --> 02:56:26,607
you know, to travel like that.

2157
02:56:27,009 --> 02:56:28,612
You couldn't...
often you could not sit,

2158
02:56:29,018 --> 02:56:31,320
you had to stand because
they were crammed full.

2159
02:56:31,969 --> 02:56:33,612
This is how it was
in those years.

2160
02:56:33,954 --> 02:56:35,369
People were hanging
on those cattle cars.

2161
02:56:35,743 --> 02:56:37,930
When you see those pictures,
that could have been us.

2162
02:56:38,522 --> 02:56:39,462
We were like that.

2163
02:56:41,300 --> 02:56:42,696
The same when you
see the bunk beds.

2164
02:56:43,092 --> 02:56:46,054
My goodness, we were lucky if we had
bunk beds where you could sleep at night.

2165
02:56:46,495 --> 02:56:49,178
It meant we did not have to
sleep outside in the snow."

SKY TROOPS POUR INTO FRANCE

2174
02:57:53,763 --> 02:57:55,630
On June 5th, 1944,

2175
02:57:56,327 --> 02:57:59,566
as the greatest armada
ever assembled left southern England,

2176
02:57:59,966 --> 02:58:04,990
bound for the coast of France,
history remembers it as D-Day.

2177
02:58:08,031 --> 02:58:12,029
As the ships head towards France,
the men, many of whom will die,

2178
02:58:12,524 --> 02:58:14,758
take care of some
last-minute chores.

2179
02:58:19,335 --> 02:58:23,249
This Hitler impersonator took the
men's mind off the task at hand,

2180
02:58:23,742 --> 02:58:25,209
at least for a few moments.

2181
02:58:28,690 --> 02:58:32,959
The time for fun ends as the
coast of France comes into view.

2182
02:58:33,922 --> 02:58:36,152
The next day on the
morning of June 6th,

2183
02:58:36,636 --> 02:58:40,040
a tremendous barrage strikes
Hitler's fortifications at Normandy

2184
02:58:40,495 --> 02:58:44,000
softening it up for the men
who will soon be in the beaches.

2185
02:58:45,060 --> 02:58:48,087
The night before,
23.000 airborne troops

2186
02:58:48,512 --> 02:58:52,579
parachuted behind enemy lines to
secure the flanks of the landing.

2187
02:58:53,531 --> 02:59:01,013
At Gold, Juno, Sword, Utah and
Omaha beaches, 130.000 Allied troops

2188
02:59:01,475 --> 02:59:04,248
would now attack five heavily
defended areas

2189
02:59:04,624 --> 02:59:06,303
of Hitler's Atlantic wall.

2190
02:59:08,575 --> 02:59:10,136
Both Roosevelt and Churchill, after
years of providing

2191
02:59:10,552 --> 02:59:12,360
the Soviet Union with financial
and military aid,

2192
02:59:12,763 --> 02:59:14,522
finaly send in troops to fight
and die for Stalin

2193
02:59:15,018 --> 02:59:16,491
and murderous Bolshevik regime.

2194
02:59:16,840 --> 02:59:18,536
The ideologies of Capitalism and
Communism will now combine

2195
02:59:19,062 --> 02:59:20,653
to annihilate not only Germany
and her people,

2196
02:59:21,155 --> 02:59:23,146
but the very notion of
Nacional Socialism itself.

2197
02:59:42,166 --> 02:59:43,638

THE BETRAYAL OF POLAND

2200
03:02:11,701 --> 03:02:15,502
The first overt signal that Stalin comes
not as liberator but as conqueror

2201
03:02:15,952 --> 03:02:17,515
is seen in late July,

2202
03:02:18,001 --> 03:02:21,529
as General Rokossovsky takes
the eastern Polish city of Lublin.

2203
03:02:22,831 --> 03:02:25,312
Within hours of the red flag's
appearance over the city,

2204
03:02:25,914 --> 03:02:29,726
Stalin has installed a puppet Communist
government: The Lublin Committee.

2205
03:02:34,116 --> 03:02:36,699
Loud denunciations by
nationalist Poles in London

2206
03:02:37,200 --> 03:02:39,806
bring little response from
the Allied corridors of power.

2207
03:02:40,462 --> 03:02:41,739
And the London Polish government

2208
03:02:42,175 --> 03:02:44,993
is power-less to prevent this theft
of its constituency.

2209
03:02:46,059 --> 03:02:48,402
But its cries will not
long go unheeded.

2210
03:02:49,191 --> 03:02:52,480
"Uncle" Joe Stalin is about
to drop his mask

2211
03:02:52,991 --> 03:02:55,095
and show his true face
to the world.

2212
03:02:57,957 --> 03:02:59,094
On the 29th of July,

2213
03:02:59,900 --> 03:03:03,635
Soviet Radio issues a general plea
to the Polish resistance movement,

2214
03:03:04,306 --> 03:03:05,192
"The Home Army".

2215
03:03:05,955 --> 03:03:10,249
The carefully worded broadcast calls for
active resistance to the occupying forces.

2216
03:03:11,383 --> 03:03:14,257
It gives the impression
without ever directly saying so

2217
03:03:14,863 --> 03:03:17,329
that the Red Army is about
to storm the city.

2218
03:03:21,700 --> 03:03:25,210
But the Red Army does not move
from its positions just east of the city.

2219
03:03:26,178 --> 03:03:29,640
And Stalin, oblivious to mounting
pressure from Western leaders,

2220
03:03:30,271 --> 03:03:32,004
grimly rejects Churchill's request

2221
03:03:32,845 --> 03:03:37,174
for the use of Soviet airfields for RAF
planes dropping supplies.

2222
03:03:37,662 --> 03:03:40,452
Without help, the Poles are doomed.

2223
03:03:42,902 --> 03:03:46,843
The battle for the city rages all
through August and into September.

2224
03:03:48,031 --> 03:03:53,607
But gradually, inevitably, the Polish
resistance movement is decimated.

2225
03:03:56,285 --> 03:03:59,083
Stalin bows to international
criticism only in September,

2226
03:03:59,744 --> 03:04:02,407
when an increase in Soviet aid
comes too late.

2227
03:04:06,845 --> 03:04:09,973
Last Home Army survivors
surrender in early October.

2228
03:04:14,033 --> 03:04:16,167
British Prime Minister Churchill
visits Moscow,

2229
03:04:16,557 --> 03:04:18,857
and he has come to discuss
the fate of Eastern Europe.

2230
03:04:19,321 --> 03:04:21,350
And he knows that there is little
that Britain

2231
03:04:21,695 --> 03:04:23,150
or even the United States can do

2232
03:04:23,791 --> 03:04:27,496
to stop a man whose ambitions are
backed by Red Army occupation.

2233
03:04:28,753 --> 03:04:31,842
And so, the two leaders
reach a pragmatic agreement.

2234
03:04:32,558 --> 03:04:34,433
Jotted down on a piece of
scrap paper,

2235
03:04:34,912 --> 03:04:37,480
he concedes Soviet control
over Bulgaria,

2236
03:04:37,863 --> 03:04:38,868
Hungary and Romania,

2237
03:04:39,404 --> 03:04:42,980
in return for Stalin's guarantee
of nonintervention in Greek politics.

2238
03:04:44,004 --> 03:04:46,220
The future of Yugoslavia
is left open.

2239
03:04:46,923 --> 03:04:49,029
And Stalin refuses even to
discuss Poland.

2240
03:04:58,857 --> 03:05:00,488
THE ENEMY WITHIN

2241
03:05:10,508 --> 03:05:12,056
Although Allied propaganda would
have us believe otherwise,

2242
03:05:12,544 --> 03:05:13,926
Adolf Hitler was one of the
most popular leader

2243
03:05:14,382 --> 03:05:15,702
the world had ever seen.

2244
03:05:17,019 --> 03:05:18,272
However, as in the case of
Julius Caesar,

2245
03:05:18,784 --> 03:05:20,518
the danger to the Führer
would come from withim.

2246
03:05:24,215 --> 03:05:26,458
Hitler had always doubted the loyalty
of some officers from the aristocracy,

2247
03:05:26,936 --> 03:05:28,864
and in 1944 he will be proven
right.

2248
03:06:35,151 --> 03:06:37,804
Only assassination could snap
the bonds of loyalty

2249
03:06:38,169 --> 03:06:39,538
which still bound millions
to Hitler.

2250
03:06:41,925 --> 03:06:45,369
The only plotters with access to
the Führer were army officers.

2251
03:06:45,785 --> 03:06:47,646
The officer who came closest
to killing Hitler

2252
03:06:48,180 --> 03:06:50,089
was Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg.

2253
03:06:50,682 --> 03:06:51,914
Claus von Stauffenberg.

2254
03:06:52,327 --> 03:06:56,713
He had his opportunity at a
briefing on the 20th of July, 1944.

2255
03:06:59,335 --> 03:07:02,947
"This was the time precisely
when we were at a very...

2256
03:07:04,123 --> 03:07:06,659
precarious military situation.

2257
03:07:07,884 --> 03:07:12,188
And the only man who could possibly
stave off disaster was Adolf Hitler.

2258
03:07:12,807 --> 03:07:14,771
That opinion was shared
by many Germans,

2259
03:07:15,235 --> 03:07:17,121
Germans who did not belong
to the Party."

ERWIN VON WITZLEBEN
EXECUTED 8 AUGUST 1944

2263
03:11:05,941 --> 03:11:07,650
At the Wolfschanze,
Hitler's headquarters in East Prussia,

2264
03:11:08,132 --> 03:11:09,698
Claus von Stauffenberg and fellow
conspirators

2265
03:11:10,106 --> 03:11:11,555
fail in their attempt on Hitler's
life

2266
03:11:12,033 --> 03:11:13,761
and the coup d'etet they
wished to effect.

2267
03:11:15,304 --> 03:11:17,965
On 21 July 1944, at 12:30 A.M.,
Stauffenberg is executed by firing squad.

2268
03:11:18,599 --> 03:11:20,622
The other conspirators are
rounded up - judged to be traitors -

2269
03:11:21,196 --> 03:11:23,085
either shot by firing squad
or hung.

2270
03:11:25,392 --> 03:11:27,492
Fearful and deluded, they had tried
to negotiate a separate peace treaty

2271
03:11:27,961 --> 03:11:29,576
with Roosevelt and Churchill,
in the futile hope

2272
03:11:30,111 --> 03:11:31,903
of preventing Stalin from
invading Germany.

2273
03:11:55,678 --> 03:11:57,506

Part 14
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

2277
03:12:19,576 --> 03:12:21,488
"MY HONOUR IS MY LOYALITY"

2278
03:12:23,025 --> 03:12:24,686
The following footage features
the translated words of Léon Degrelle,

2279
03:12:25,079 --> 03:12:26,606
one of the most famous of
the Waffen SS.

2280
03:12:27,193 --> 03:12:28,714
Born in Belgium, he joined
as a private

2281
03:12:29,131 --> 03:12:30,846
and earned all stripes from
corporal to general

2282
03:12:31,229 --> 03:12:32,485
for exceptional bravery in combat

2283
03:12:32,948 --> 03:12:34,421
and was the recipient of
the highest honours.

2284
03:12:35,266 --> 03:12:36,131
the Ritterkreuz

2285
03:12:36,539 --> 03:12:37,619
the Oak Leaves

2286
03:12:38,057 --> 03:12:39,122
the Gold German Cross

2287
03:12:39,629 --> 03:12:40,940
... and numerous other decorations

2288
03:12:41,412 --> 03:12:43,138
for outstanding vaour under
enemy fire.

2289
03:12:44,248 --> 03:12:45,764
One of the last to fight on
the Eastern Front,

2290
03:12:45,987 --> 03:12:47,473
he was engaged in 75 heavy
hand-to-hand combat actions

2291
03:12:47,946 --> 03:12:49,488
and was wounded on several
occasions.

2292
03:12:51,951 --> 03:12:53,217
Léon Degrelle escaped unconditional
surrender

2293
03:12:53,615 --> 03:12:55,112
by flying 1500 miles across Europe,

2294
03:12:55,551 --> 03:12:57,210
surviving constant fire along
the way

2295
03:12:57,633 --> 03:12:59,249
and managing to crash land
on the beach

2296
03:12:59,707 --> 03:13:01,434
of San Sebastian in Spain,
critically wounded.

2297
03:13:01,499 --> 03:13:02,576
Against all odds, he survived

2298
03:13:03,008 --> 03:13:04,592
and lived out the rest of
his life in Spain

2299
03:13:04,808 --> 03:13:06,536
where he eventually died
at the age of 87.

2300
03:13:07,417 --> 03:13:08,744
Adolf Hitler once told him,

2301
03:13:09,208 --> 03:13:11,294
"If I had a son, I would want him
to be just like you."

2302
03:13:21,486 --> 03:13:23,214
General Léon Degrelle

2303
03:13:31,219 --> 03:13:34,059
Young men who joined the SS were
trained like no other army in the world.

2304
03:13:34,990 --> 03:13:37,638
Military and academic instructions
were intensive.

2305
03:13:38,554 --> 03:13:40,889
But it was the physical
training that was most rigorous.

2306
03:13:41,910 --> 03:13:43,552
They practiced sports
with excellence.

2307
03:13:44,423 --> 03:13:47,605
Each of them could have performed
with distinction at the Olympic Games.

2308
03:13:48,596 --> 03:13:51,520
The extraordinary physical endurance
of the SS on the Russian front,

2309
03:13:52,288 --> 03:13:55,309
which so amazed the world, was
due to their intensive training.

2310
03:13:56,322 --> 03:13:58,169
The most striking feature
of the Waffen SS

2311
03:13:59,040 --> 03:14:02,588
was that it was composed of volunteers
from some 30 different countries.

2312
03:14:03,827 --> 03:14:04,853
What cause gathered them,

2313
03:14:05,252 --> 03:14:07,754
and why did they volunteer
their lives?

2314
03:14:08,525 --> 03:14:09,618
Was it a German phenomenon?

2315
03:14:11,113 --> 03:14:12,176
At the beginning, yes.

2316
03:14:13,433 --> 03:14:14,909
In addition to Germans
from Germany,

2317
03:14:15,497 --> 03:14:19,340
northwestern Europeans, descendants of
Germans from all across Europe, enlisted.

2318
03:14:19,961 --> 03:14:23,155
Then in 1941, during the great clash
with the Soviet Union,

2319
03:14:23,728 --> 03:14:25,761
rose the European Waffen SS.

2320
03:14:27,265 --> 03:14:30,084
It was on the front lines that the
results of the SS physical training

2321
03:14:30,429 --> 03:14:31,227
could really be noticed.

2322
03:14:31,857 --> 03:14:34,592
An SS officer had the same
rigorous training as the soldiers.

2323
03:14:35,540 --> 03:14:38,769
A relationship of the equality and mutual
respect between soldiers and officers

2324
03:14:39,463 --> 03:14:40,446
was always present.

2325
03:14:41,277 --> 03:14:44,181
Half of all division commanders
were killed in action - half!

2326
03:14:45,319 --> 03:14:47,232
There is not an army in the
world where this happened.

2327
03:14:48,040 --> 03:14:50,801
The SS officer always
led his troops into battle.

2328
03:14:51,344 --> 03:14:54,247
To them, Hitler was the most
exceptional man ever seen.

2329
03:14:55,316 --> 03:14:56,439
Hitler understood them,

2330
03:14:56,891 --> 03:15:00,251
and had the remarkable idea
to open the doors to the SS.

2331
03:15:01,361 --> 03:15:03,507
The response to Hitler's
offer was overwhelming.

2332
03:15:04,035 --> 03:15:07,430
Legions from Norway, Denmark,
Holland and Flanders were formed.

2333
03:15:08,529 --> 03:15:09,724
Hitler welcomed them home.

2334
03:15:10,961 --> 03:15:13,505
German racialism has been
deliberately distorted.

2335
03:15:14,656 --> 03:15:17,701
It was concerned with making the German
race strong and healthy in every way.

2336
03:15:18,753 --> 03:15:21,690
Hitler was not interested in
having millions of degenerates.

2337
03:15:22,217 --> 03:15:25,303
Today one finds rampant alcohol
and drug addiction everywhere.

2338
03:15:26,175 --> 03:15:28,183
Hitler cared that German
families be healthy,

2339
03:15:28,751 --> 03:15:31,773
cared that they raised healthy children
for the renewal of a healthy nation.

2340
03:15:32,609 --> 03:15:35,953
German racialism meant rediscovering
the creative values of their own race,

2341
03:15:36,566 --> 03:15:37,681
rediscovering their culture.

2342
03:15:38,511 --> 03:15:40,492
It was a search for excellence,
a noble idea.

2343
03:15:41,837 --> 03:15:44,878
National Socialist racialism
was not against the other races.

2344
03:15:45,467 --> 03:15:47,542
It aimed at defending
and improving its race,

2345
03:15:47,996 --> 03:15:50,894
and wished that all other races
did the same for themselves.

2346
03:15:51,482 --> 03:15:53,193
That was demonstrated
when the Waffen SS

2347
03:15:53,588 --> 03:15:57,196
enlarged its rank to include
60.000 Islamic SS.

2348
03:15:58,387 --> 03:16:00,398
The Waffen SS respected their
way of life,

2349
03:16:00,828 --> 03:16:02,997
their customs and their religious
beliefs.

2350
03:16:03,832 --> 03:16:05,954
Each Islamic SS battalion
had an imam.

2351
03:16:06,667 --> 03:16:07,983
Each company had a mullah.

2352
03:16:08,960 --> 03:16:11,888
It was our common wish that their
qualities found their highest expression.

2353
03:16:12,499 --> 03:16:13,814
This was our racialism.

2354
03:16:14,742 --> 03:16:16,725
I was present when each
of my Islamic comrades

2355
03:16:17,114 --> 03:16:19,196
received a personal gift from
Hitler during the new year.

2356
03:16:19,937 --> 03:16:21,550
It was a pendant
with a small Koran.

2357
03:16:22,668 --> 03:16:24,921
Hitler was honoring them
with this small symbolic gift.

2358
03:16:25,713 --> 03:16:27,207
He was honoring
them with what was

2359
03:16:27,541 --> 03:16:30,184
the most important aspect
of their lives and their history.

2360
03:16:31,045 --> 03:16:33,566
National Socialist racialism
was loyal to the German race

2361
03:16:33,901 --> 03:16:35,451
and totally respected
all other races.

2362
03:16:36,240 --> 03:16:38,991
The young European volunteers
had observed two things.

2363
03:16:39,975 --> 03:16:43,366
First, that Hitler was the only leader
who was capable of building Europe,

2364
03:16:43,930 --> 03:16:44,976
and secondly that Hitler,

2365
03:16:45,737 --> 03:16:48,730
and Hitler alone, could defeat
the world threat of Communism.

2366
03:16:49,367 --> 03:16:51,835
The Communists never aimed at
serving the interests of Russia.

2367
03:16:52,752 --> 03:16:55,714
Communism does not limit itself
to acquire chunks of territories,

2368
03:16:56,352 --> 03:16:58,890
but aims at total world domination.

2369
03:16:59,939 --> 03:17:01,750
Alone among all the leaders
of the world,

2370
03:17:02,107 --> 03:17:05,578
Hitler saw this concept as
an equal threat to all nations.

2371
03:17:06,405 --> 03:17:08,700
Right through the war the
Waffen SS never retreated.

2372
03:17:09,280 --> 03:17:10,679
They would rather
die than retreat.

2373
03:17:12,654 --> 03:17:14,172
One cannot forget the figures.

2374
03:17:15,018 --> 03:17:20,967
During the 1941 winter the Waffen SS
lost 43.000 men in front of Moscow.

2375
03:17:22,030 --> 03:17:26,042
The regiment "Der Führer" fought
almost literally to the last man.

2376
03:17:26,305 --> 03:17:28,936
Only 35 men survived out
of the entire regiment.

2377
03:17:30,036 --> 03:17:33,160
The Der Führer men stood fast,
and no Soviet troops got through.

2378
03:17:33,559 --> 03:17:36,098
And that is what Hitler
admired most of all: guts.

2379
03:17:37,034 --> 03:17:39,645
For him it was not enough to have
intelligent or clever associates.

2380
03:17:40,467 --> 03:17:41,944
These people can often fall
to pieces,

2381
03:17:42,693 --> 03:17:45,798
as we will see during the following
winter at the Battle of Stalingrad,

2382
03:17:46,206 --> 03:17:47,365
with General Paulus.

2383
03:17:47,732 --> 03:17:50,253
The defeat there was decided
by a man without courage.

2384
03:17:50,410 --> 03:17:52,926
He was not capable to face
danger with determination.

2385
03:17:53,847 --> 03:17:55,610
To say, "I will not surrender.

2386
03:17:56,529 --> 03:17:58,166
I will stand fast until I win."

2387
03:17:58,843 --> 03:18:01,842
But he was morally and
physically gutless, and he lost.

2388
03:18:02,319 --> 03:18:03,257
Without their heroism,

2389
03:18:03,655 --> 03:18:06,452
Germany would have been annihilated
by December 1941.

2390
03:18:07,005 --> 03:18:11,052
The Roosevelts and the Churchills sold
out Europe in Teheran, Yalta and Potsdam.

2391
03:18:12,833 --> 03:18:14,890
Not since the great religious
orders of the middle ages

2392
03:18:15,575 --> 03:18:18,154
had there been such
selfless idealism and heroism.

2393
03:18:19,104 --> 03:18:20,529
In this century of materialism,

2394
03:18:20,831 --> 03:18:23,481
the SS stand out as shining light
of spirituality.

2395
03:18:24,250 --> 03:18:27,742
"Greatness in adversity'" is
the distinction of the SS.

2396
03:18:28,870 --> 03:18:30,109
THE HOLY OATH OF THE WAFFEN SS

2397
03:18:30,536 --> 03:18:33,050
"I swear to thee Adolf Hitler as Führer
and Chancellor of the German Reih

2398
03:18:33,085 --> 03:18:34,378
loyality and bravery.

2399
03:18:34,439 --> 03:18:36,656
I vow to thee and to the superiors
whom thou shall appoint obedience

2400
03:18:36,662 --> 03:18:38,713
until dead so help me God."

2401
03:18:47,646 --> 03:18:49,484
STALIN'S PURGES

2402
03:18:57,617 --> 03:19:01,177
With the return of the Soviet forces
in 1944, the mountain peoples,

2403
03:19:02,089 --> 03:19:04,288
Ingushe, Balkars, and above all,
Chechens,

2404
03:19:04,774 --> 03:19:07,438
are rounded up in dawn raids
of new horror.

2405
03:19:08,212 --> 03:19:11,291
Mobile NKVD units
are sent into the hills.

2406
03:19:17,615 --> 03:19:20,232
Whole peoples,
uncomprehending of their guilt,

2407
03:19:20,782 --> 03:19:22,924
are marked down for
punitive deportation.

2408
03:19:36,810 --> 03:19:41,267
It is the tragedy of a small nation in
the hands of a vast and ruthless state.

2409
03:19:42,091 --> 03:19:43,411
They're dragged from their homes,

2410
03:19:43,895 --> 03:19:45,265
their lifestyle destroyed,

2411
03:19:45,897 --> 03:19:48,889
leaving whole areas empty
of any inhabitants.

2412
03:19:53,474 --> 03:19:56,295
And when German troops are
driven from the Crimea in May,

2413
03:19:56,835 --> 03:20:01,791
Stalin is convinced the Tartar people had
been guilty of collaboration with the enemy.

2414
03:20:03,809 --> 03:20:06,401
He immediately dissolves the Muslim
autonomous republic

2415
03:20:06,730 --> 03:20:08,154
of the Crimean Tartars,

2416
03:20:08,833 --> 03:20:13,412
and punitively deports 400.000
people, men, women and children.

2417
03:20:17,147 --> 03:20:19,648
And beyond the misery of
shocked and frightened people,

2418
03:20:20,728 --> 03:20:22,846
the disregard for military needs.

2419
03:20:24,020 --> 03:20:28,018
This is a time when the Soviet forces
need all the transport they can get.

2420
03:20:34,690 --> 03:20:36,117
THE GENOCIDE OF GERMANY

2421
03:20:44,325 --> 03:20:44,828
EAST PRUSSIA 1944

2422
03:20:45,219 --> 03:20:46,531
East Prussia, with
its forests and lakes,

2423
03:20:47,138 --> 03:20:50,354
was the first part of prewar German
territory the Red Army entered.

2424
03:20:54,286 --> 03:20:57,389
It is estimated that as many as 2
million German women were raped

2425
03:20:57,710 --> 03:20:59,026
by Red Army soldiers.

2426
03:21:01,355 --> 03:21:03,172
"From 1944 to 1947

2427
03:21:03,665 --> 03:21:07,537
what occurred to Germany,
in the last year of the war

2428
03:21:07,918 --> 03:21:12,839
and the immediate postwar
years was a crime so terrible;

2429
03:21:13,175 --> 03:21:16,008
and the world has never
experienced such a crime like this.

2430
03:21:16,621 --> 03:21:20,957
And the fact that it remains a secret
doesn't mean it is any less of a crime,

2431
03:21:22,227 --> 03:21:27,002
but it probably was the largest,
the darkest and the bloodiest, uh...

2432
03:21:28,051 --> 03:21:30,091
secret in world history.

2433
03:21:30,584 --> 03:21:32,662
The massacres, the rapes,
the starvation,

2434
03:21:33,902 --> 03:21:39,081
the deliberate attempt to
destroy a nation entirely. Entirely!

2435
03:21:39,544 --> 03:21:42,034
Now I'm not talking about
leaving something left.

2436
03:21:42,624 --> 03:21:44,555
Basically, that was the uh...

2437
03:21:45,061 --> 03:21:47,202
uh that's what they were,
the Allies were traveling under

2438
03:21:47,531 --> 03:21:51,186
in the last year of the war and
the immediate postwar years.

2439
03:21:51,401 --> 03:21:55,396
This nightmarish attempt
to destroy Germany.

2440
03:21:55,687 --> 03:21:58,153
A terror bombing toward
the late stages of the war.

2441
03:21:58,605 --> 03:21:59,611
A terror bombing:
there's no other...

2442
03:22:00,147 --> 03:22:04,475
There's no other phrase that says
it quite as well as "terror bombing".

2443
03:22:04,969 --> 03:22:08,527
Long after all military objects
had been blown to bits / splinters,

2444
03:22:09,213 --> 03:22:13,043
the American and British Air Forces
continued to blast German cities,

2445
03:22:13,597 --> 03:22:15,209
blasting the rubble to even
more rubble.

2446
03:22:16,370 --> 03:22:20,004
A lot of folks are still, to this very
day, their bones are still buried

2447
03:22:20,531 --> 03:22:21,647
underneath the rubble in Germany;

2448
03:22:22,031 --> 03:22:23,853
that was built over of course,
after the war.

2449
03:22:24,373 --> 03:22:27,220
What it was like for...
a woman?

2450
03:22:27,618 --> 03:22:32,104
Let us say a... let's say a 45
year old something woman,

2451
03:22:32,463 --> 03:22:37,444
a German who was in a village
when the Russians finally came,

2452
03:22:38,027 --> 03:22:40,129
when they finally burst through
and the fighting had past.

2453
03:22:40,612 --> 03:22:44,163
And then comes the second
echelon of Russian troops,

2454
03:22:44,578 --> 03:22:50,705
for the most part Asiatics and Mongolians
from the Rusk Russian eastern republics.

2455
03:22:51,559 --> 03:22:54,015
And the rapes began... and
what does a woman do?

2456
03:22:54,519 --> 03:22:55,947
How do you deal with rape?

2457
03:22:56,274 --> 03:22:58,367
And I'm not talking
about just one soldier

2458
03:22:59,103 --> 03:23:01,373
perhaps dragging you
into a room and raping you.

2459
03:23:01,818 --> 03:23:04,021
I'm talking about 5 maybe 10
at a time;

2460
03:23:04,658 --> 03:23:06,775
for days, for weeks, this goes on.

2461
03:23:08,227 --> 03:23:12,328
Some women, I mean again we're talking
in the words of the people themselves

2462
03:23:14,875 --> 03:23:16,919
They did all sorts of
things to avoid rapes.

2463
03:23:17,397 --> 03:23:21,107
They become almost indifferent to it...
indifferent to it after a while; almost.

2464
03:23:21,684 --> 03:23:22,672
Some of them lost their minds.

2465
03:23:22,984 --> 03:23:26,560
But some women, who were
actually good looking prior to the rapes,

2466
03:23:27,214 --> 03:23:30,127
actually started trying to
make themselves look uglier.

2467
03:23:31,170 --> 03:23:34,258
They would feign illnesses
and act like they were cripples.

2468
03:23:34,981 --> 03:23:36,060
And it still didn't work.

2469
03:23:37,028 --> 03:23:38,122
The madness for the uh...

2470
03:23:39,002 --> 03:23:43,442
among the Russian soldiers
for rape was incredible,

2471
03:23:43,929 --> 03:23:48,171
and sometimes women were raped 10,
20 times a night, a 100 times a week.

2472
03:23:48,435 --> 03:23:50,272
Sometimes they were raped
to death;

2473
03:23:51,063 --> 03:23:52,466
and then they were raped
some more.

2474
03:23:52,895 --> 03:23:56,436
And of course mothers with
children

2475
03:23:56,780 --> 03:23:59,516
were frantic to try to protect
their little ones.

2476
03:24:00,000 --> 03:24:01,215
They'd do anything they could.

2477
03:24:01,560 --> 03:24:03,074
Of course they would give their
bodies gladly;

2478
03:24:03,658 --> 03:24:05,033
if they could protect their children.

2479
03:24:05,406 --> 03:24:06,310
Mostly it didn't work though.

2480
03:24:06,732 --> 03:24:08,400
There was an old saying,
"from 8 to 88".

2481
03:24:09,717 --> 03:24:12,816
That was the time... that was
the age frame for rapes,

2482
03:24:13,640 --> 03:24:14,565
if you can believe that.

2483
03:24:15,243 --> 03:24:19,084
Even grandmothers were
taken and raped repeatedly.

2484
03:24:19,342 --> 03:24:24,250
Even people that were sick and women who
were on their periods; nothing was sacred.

2485
03:24:24,637 --> 03:24:28,333
And just very nearly extinguished
the German people altogether."

2486
03:24:32,741 --> 03:24:34,303
"Use force and break the racial
pride of these German women.

2487
03:24:34,734 --> 03:24:36,344
Take them as your lawful booty.
Kill! As you storm onward.

2488
03:24:36,774 --> 03:24:38,270
Kill, you gallant soldiers of
the Red Army!"

2489
03:24:38,671 --> 03:24:40,119
Jewish Soviet Commisar
Ilya Ehrenburg

2490
03:24:45,361 --> 03:24:46,655
FYODOR KHROPATIY
27th Soviet Army

2491
03:24:48,229 --> 03:24:50,595
What if you found one of your
fellow soldiers had raped someone?

2492
03:24:51,979 --> 03:24:54,164
Nobody took any notice

2493
03:24:54,675 --> 03:24:57,266
on the conrary, soldiers
told each other everything

2494
03:24:59,595 --> 03:25:03,170
it was almost considered to be
heroic or couageous

2495
03:25:03,732 --> 03:25:09,445
... to sleep with a women -
or several

2496
03:25:14,410 --> 03:25:18,056
Even if someone was murdered -
well, it was war

2497
03:25:21,107 --> 03:25:26,913
So it was no big deal if a soldier
slept with a women or girl.

2498
03:25:34,463 --> 03:25:35,098
Our valint troops continue
their march to the west

2499
03:25:43,865 --> 03:25:46,024
But there were those who had
been glad to see the Red Army.

2500
03:25:47,180 --> 03:25:49,966
First, the population of the
occupied parts of the Soviet Union,

2501
03:25:51,222 --> 03:25:52,908
and now the Soviet prisoners
of war.

2502
03:25:54,466 --> 03:25:57,417
Tatyana Naneva, who had served
in the Red Army as a nurse,

2503
03:25:58,081 --> 03:26:00,480
was one of more than a
million Soviet prisoners of war,

2504
03:26:00,932 --> 03:26:03,740
who had been transported to camps
within the greater German Reich.

2505
03:26:05,908 --> 03:26:07,783
She was overjoyed when
the Red Army arrived,

2506
03:26:08,535 --> 03:26:10,335
a feeling that was not reciprocated.

2507
03:26:15,550 --> 03:26:18,716
Nearly 2 million Soviet prisoners of
war were liberated by the Red Army.

2508
03:26:19,801 --> 03:26:21,690
All were to suffer at
the hands of Stalin.

2509
03:26:23,120 --> 03:26:24,518
For many, like Tatyana Naneva,

2510
03:26:25,269 --> 03:26:28,790
their suffering began here in a
filtration camp run by the secret police.

2511
03:26:30,100 --> 03:26:32,566
Their problem was that Stalin
maintained that the Soviet Union

2512
03:26:32,934 --> 03:26:36,167
had no prisoners of war,
only traitors.

2513
03:26:37,774 --> 03:26:39,684
For the crime of being captured
by the Germans,

2514
03:26:40,522 --> 03:26:42,255
volunteer nurse Tatyana Naneva

2515
03:26:42,566 --> 03:26:44,262
was sentenced to six years
in the gulag

2516
03:26:45,069 --> 03:26:46,926
and lifetime exile in Siberia.

2517
03:26:55,075 --> 03:26:57,139
To be continued

2518
03:27:02,327 --> 03:27:04,375
Part 15
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

2519
03:27:27,985 --> 03:27:29,908
On 7 July 1944, around 57.000
German prisoners

2520
03:27:30,356 --> 03:27:31,940
were marched through the
streets of Moscow

2521
03:27:32,371 --> 03:27:33,741
to be loaded onto cattle trains

2522
03:27:34,181 --> 03:27:35,725
and transported to the other
regions of Siberia.

2523
03:27:39,500 --> 03:27:40,884
After the march ended the streets
were

2524
03:27:41,318 --> 03:27:42,949
symbolicaly disifected of
"fashist" footsteps...

2525
03:27:45,193 --> 03:27:46,784
Between 1939 and 1945, around
7 million German and Axis POWs

2526
03:27:47,257 --> 03:27:48,386
were sent to the Soviet Gulags,

2527
03:27:48,832 --> 03:27:50,408
with estimated German deaths
alone over3 million.

2528
03:27:54,551 --> 03:27:56,427
The majority of prisoners sent here
will never see

2529
03:27:56,884 --> 03:27:58,744
their home and families again.

2530
03:28:28,742 --> 03:28:30,739
However, one German soldier
marching in Moscow

2531
03:28:31,178 --> 03:28:32,855
would defy all odds to see
his family again.

2532
03:28:34,858 --> 03:28:36,741
Sentenced to 25 years hard labour
in the mines

2533
03:28:37,198 --> 03:28:39,661
of the barren eastern reaches of
Siberia, he will eventually escape.

2534
03:28:41,129 --> 03:28:42,750
It will take him 3 years to cross
almost 9.000 miles,

2535
03:28:43,460 --> 03:28:45,836
enduring the most inhospitable
conditions on earth.

2536
03:29:03,376 --> 03:29:04,988
His name was Cornelius Rost,
but to avoid retribution from the KGB

2537
03:29:05,549 --> 03:29:07,460
he would be forced to use
the alias of "Clemens Forell".

2538
03:29:07,890 --> 03:29:09,097
His book will be translated into
15 laguages,

2539
03:29:09,489 --> 03:29:11,096
selling over 12 million copies
worldwide.

2540
03:29:11,516 --> 03:29:13,421
It was the basis for an
award-winning film in 2002.

2541
03:34:12,667 --> 03:34:14,739
October 1949

2542
03:34:44,442 --> 03:34:46,091
Christmas 1952

2543
03:35:18,122 --> 03:35:19,858
DECEMBER 1944

2544
03:35:24,857 --> 03:35:26,773
Setbacks for Germany und the Axis
coutriees accelerated during 1944,

2545
03:35:27,256 --> 03:35:29,065
but in December the same year,
Hitler devised a brilliant plan

2546
03:35:29,546 --> 03:35:31,106
which would take the Allies
completely by suprise

2547
03:35:31,513 --> 03:35:33,090
and almost turn the war
on its head.

2548
03:35:33,314 --> 03:35:34,923
Fought in the densely forested
Ardennes mountain region of Belgium,

2549
03:35:35,323 --> 03:35:37,715
devastating German offensive
would become known as...

2550
03:35:39,358 --> 03:35:40,949
THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE

2551
03:35:53,006 --> 03:35:54,183
In December 1944,

2552
03:35:54,655 --> 03:35:58,948
American forces were pummeled by German
Panzer divisions in the Ardennes forest.

2553
03:35:59,298 --> 03:36:01,293
It was a decisive moment in
World War Two.

2554
03:36:01,984 --> 03:36:04,951
Hitler would either succeed in pushing
back the approaching Allied Armies,

2555
03:36:05,583 --> 03:36:07,428
if he can drive the American's
and the British

2556
03:36:07,755 --> 03:36:09,035
all the way back to the
coast line,

2557
03:36:09,620 --> 03:36:12,680
he may be able to force
them into a negotiated peace?

2558
03:36:13,720 --> 03:36:16,944
Late in October, the Germans
begin secretly moving their units

2559
03:36:17,264 --> 03:36:20,467
to points East of the Ardennes,
without arousing Allied suspicions.

2560
03:36:20,974 --> 03:36:24,293
A quarter million Germans roll
towards the Western Front.

2561
03:36:25,516 --> 03:36:28,150
But officers in Allied
intelligence refuse to believe it.

2562
03:36:28,692 --> 03:36:32,484
They all agree the Germans don't have
the military strength for such an attack.

2563
03:36:32,952 --> 03:36:34,888
Early morning on December 16th,

2564
03:36:35,343 --> 03:36:39,339
a shattering barrage of German
artillery and rocket fire, lights the skies.

2565
03:36:48,427 --> 03:36:50,084
Gloomy weather for
the next several days,

2566
03:36:50,419 --> 03:36:54,307
provides effective cover for the German
might, that churns over the roads.

2567
03:36:55,571 --> 03:36:56,884
Panzer units slash through.

2568
03:36:57,276 --> 03:37:01,637
In the center, the Germans gouge a 12 mile
corridor to the approaches of Bastogne.

2569
03:37:02,350 --> 03:37:04,476
They are ordered to surround
and bypass this town,

2570
03:37:04,994 --> 03:37:06,579
then drive for the Meuse river.

2571
03:37:11,667 --> 03:37:14,697
There is all out confusion.
Communications are sketchy.

2572
03:37:15,223 --> 03:37:18,592
American troops discover
Germans in front and behind them.

2573
03:37:20,167 --> 03:37:22,039
Panzers under
cover of fog and rain,

2574
03:37:22,543 --> 03:37:26,690
slip into American armored columns,
then blast the Americans off the road.

2575
03:37:31,548 --> 03:37:36,193
More than 7.000 soldiers of the 106th
destroy their weapons and give up.

2576
03:37:36,824 --> 03:37:40,992
Next to Bataan, this is the largest
mass surrender in military history.

2577
03:37:43,968 --> 03:37:45,886
Elsewhere, with
communications shattered,

2578
03:37:46,231 --> 03:37:48,583
other Americans fight isolated
holding actions.

2579
03:37:49,515 --> 03:37:52,686
Gradually, small scattered units
slow the German advance.

2580
03:37:53,061 --> 03:37:54,439
Especially around St. Vith.

2581
03:37:55,057 --> 03:37:59,364
The 5th Panzer Army, had good success,
in the Southern part of the invasion.

2582
03:37:59,871 --> 03:38:03,045
However, the effects were not
what the Germans had wanted.

2583
03:38:03,228 --> 03:38:05,588
They were trying to race to
the Meuse river in two days.

2584
03:38:06,403 --> 03:38:08,560
On the third day, General
Dwight Eisenhower,

2585
03:38:08,862 --> 03:38:10,422
orders General Patton's third Army

2586
03:38:10,757 --> 03:38:13,556
to attack the German flank
and relieve Bastogne.

2587
03:38:14,180 --> 03:38:17,740
December 20th, the Battle
of the Bulge, is in its fifth day.

2588
03:38:18,133 --> 03:38:22,020
American forces are reeling under the
impact of the mighty German offensive.

2589
03:38:23,604 --> 03:38:28,109
General Patton and his third Army, are driving
North toward Bastogne, to counter attack.

2590
03:38:29,708 --> 03:38:33,436
December 21st, a wintery snow
falls throughout the Ardennes.

2591
03:38:37,172 --> 03:38:39,118
St. Vith is taken by the Germans.

2592
03:38:39,483 --> 03:38:42,209
Now the center route across
the Ardennes is wide open.

2593
03:38:42,714 --> 03:38:45,316
The Germans flow around Bastogne
on all sides,

2594
03:38:45,645 --> 03:38:47,709
encircling the American forces there.

2595
03:38:52,368 --> 03:38:55,184
They thought the Germans were
beaten, after the race across France.

2596
03:38:55,961 --> 03:38:57,057
The Germans were not beaten.

2597
03:39:01,459 --> 03:39:06,853
December 22nd: the situation in Bastogne,
grows desperate; ammunition is short.

2598
03:39:07,325 --> 03:39:12,652
McAuliffe's artillery battalions are down
to 10 rounds per gun; and it's still snowing.

2599
03:39:13,275 --> 03:39:15,126
The cold causes more casualties.

2600
03:39:15,975 --> 03:39:18,102
Frostbite is rampant
among the troops.

2601
03:39:18,993 --> 03:39:22,095
The Germans send an emissary
to Bastogne, with an ultimatum.

2602
03:39:22,581 --> 03:39:24,213
Since the Americans
are surrounded

2603
03:39:24,422 --> 03:39:28,891
and there is only one possibility to save
them from death: an honorable surrender.

2604
03:39:29,473 --> 03:39:32,401
General McAuliffe's reply
is short and to the point.

2605
03:39:32,809 --> 03:39:36,231
McAuliffe's bravado is based on
the expectation of the third Army.

2606
03:39:36,775 --> 03:39:39,141
General Patton's time table is
a critical factor.

2607
03:39:39,717 --> 03:39:43,636
If the German's move on Bastogne,
they could easily take it at this point.

2608
03:39:44,150 --> 03:39:46,564
The surrounded and
undermanned US Army watches

2609
03:39:46,906 --> 03:39:48,925
and waits anxiously
for reinforcements.

2610
03:39:49,355 --> 03:39:53,022
The freezing cold conditions
don't make it easier for either side.

2611
03:39:53,242 --> 03:39:57,691
The next day, December 23rd, dawns
bright and sunny; perfect flying weather.

2612
03:39:58,141 --> 03:39:59,801
American's in Bastogne cheer

2613
03:40:00,136 --> 03:40:03,061
as Allied planes fly overhead
to bomb and strafe the enemy.

2614
03:40:04,280 --> 03:40:06,643
To drop supplies,
not all that's needed,

2615
03:40:07,035 --> 03:40:09,410
but enough to enable
the American's to hang on.

2616
03:40:14,554 --> 03:40:18,161
On Christmas day, news reaches
Bastogne that the Western spearhead

2617
03:40:18,496 --> 03:40:22,761
of the German 2nd Panzer division has
been stopped, just short of the Meuse.

2618
03:40:23,433 --> 03:40:27,380
When Hitler is told by his Generals,
he orders the expected all out attack.

2619
03:40:36,624 --> 03:40:40,606
The Wehrmacht advances on Bastogne
with 9 divisions, 4 of them armored.

2620
03:40:41,126 --> 03:40:44,977
A great part of this effort is aimed at
closing the American corridor to the South.

2621
03:40:45,466 --> 03:40:49,392
On January 3rd, the Allies
launch a 3 pronged counter attack.

2622
03:40:49,793 --> 03:40:54,677
By January 16th, patrols from the 1st
and 3rd Armies meet North of Bastogne.

2623
03:40:55,372 --> 03:40:59,364
By early February, the German's have
been pushed back to where they started.

2624
03:41:00,531 --> 03:41:03,006
By the end of the Battle of the
Bulge, they knew they couldn't win.

2625
03:41:03,455 --> 03:41:04,524
And from that time on,

2626
03:41:05,029 --> 03:41:06,877
the remains of the Panzer
Wehr division,

2627
03:41:07,588 --> 03:41:10,301
are sent to the Eastern front,
where it was eventually destroyed.

2628
03:41:10,773 --> 03:41:14,285
It became clear the German Army no
longer could fight on the Western Front.

2629
03:41:17,283 --> 03:41:18,649
Due to the Soviet taking the
oilfields in the east,

2630
03:41:19,128 --> 03:41:20,978
lack of fuel prevented the new
German Tiger tanks

2631
03:41:21,419 --> 03:41:22,963
from reaching the Meuse river.

2632
03:41:23,459 --> 03:41:24,933
The Battle of the Bulge was the
bloodiest battle

2633
03:41:25,399 --> 03:41:26,781
US forces fought in World
WarTwo.

2634
03:41:27,249 --> 03:41:28,029
It resulted in:

2635
03:41:28,503 --> 03:41:29,745
19.000 dead

2636
03:41:30,210 --> 03:41:31,361
47.000 wounded

2637
03:41:31,930 --> 03:41:33,098
23.000 captured

2638
03:41:33,888 --> 03:41:35,400
These figures were not surpassed
those of any other battle.

2639
03:41:37,306 --> 03:41:38,335
With official German losses
at 84.834,

2640
03:41:38,767 --> 03:41:40,360
the last of the reserves were
now exhausted.

2641
03:41:40,784 --> 03:41:43,095
The lack of fuel would eventually leave
the Luftwaffe permanently grounded.

2642
03:41:45,273 --> 03:41:46,332
The remaining German forces

2643
03:41:46,820 --> 03:41:48,412
would be bombed incessantly
in their retreat to Berlin.

2644
03:42:01,422 --> 03:42:03,163
To be continued

2645
03:42:10,053 --> 03:42:12,657
Part 16
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

2646
03:42:18,572 --> 03:42:20,330
While the Western Allies were
held up in the Ardennes,

2647
03:42:20,674 --> 03:42:21,818
fighting the Battle of the Bulge,

2648
03:42:23,273 --> 03:42:26,679
on the Eastern Front, the Red
Army was making good progress.

2649
03:42:28,171 --> 03:42:31,363
They entered Warsaw on
the 17th of January, 1945.

2650
03:42:44,249 --> 03:42:47,337
The locals cheered as the Polish
units in the Red Army passed by.

2651
03:42:48,631 --> 03:42:50,780
They did not know that some of
the Officers they applauded

2652
03:42:51,098 --> 03:42:52,186
were from the Soviet Union,

2653
03:42:52,947 --> 03:42:54,812
and were only pretending
to be Poles.

2654
03:43:00,899 --> 03:43:03,241
Stalin hadn't just created
new Polish Officers,

2655
03:43:04,122 --> 03:43:06,410
he'd created an entire
new Polish government.

2656
03:43:07,777 --> 03:43:09,226
Unlike the Polish government in exile,

2657
03:43:09,794 --> 03:43:13,258
this group of tame Poles would
do just what Stalin told them to.

2658
03:43:18,970 --> 03:43:22,227
The Red Army continued to push
forward further into Eastern Europe.

2659
03:43:22,793 --> 03:43:26,588
Capturing Budapest, the Capital
of Hungary, in February, 1945.

2660
03:43:28,217 --> 03:43:29,279
Budapest

2661
03:43:29,616 --> 03:43:31,839
The Hungarians had been Allies
of the Nazi's.

2662
03:43:33,629 --> 03:43:36,566
Together with the German's they had
fought fiercely against the Red Army.

2663
03:43:39,254 --> 03:43:40,524
Now they would pay for it.

2664
03:43:47,885 --> 03:43:49,237
Report by the Direcors of the
Hungarien General Credit Bank

2665
03:43:49,525 --> 03:43:51,342
They opened every safe
and strong box.

2666
03:43:52,588 --> 03:43:55,938
They took away 113
Million Pengoe in cash.

2667
03:43:56,696 --> 03:44:00,863
As well as about 800 suitcases and
other containers deposited by clients.

2668
03:44:01,424 --> 03:44:04,184
And emptied 1.400 safety
deposit boxes.

2669
03:44:13,758 --> 03:44:18,164
Nearby, other Soviets took paintings and
other works of Art worth Millions of pounds.

2670
03:44:18,908 --> 03:44:21,870
Including works by Renoir,
El Greco, and Goya.

2671
03:44:32,814 --> 03:44:36,449
An estimated 99% of these
artworks have never been recovered.

2672
03:44:42,934 --> 03:44:44,062
As well as the wealth
of the city,

2673
03:44:45,028 --> 03:44:48,056
the population was also at the
mercy of the Soviet occupiers.

2674
03:44:50,877 --> 03:44:53,943
But what happened to them in the
aftermath of the Soviet victory in Budapest,

2675
03:44:54,303 --> 03:44:55,478
was to become infamous.

2676
03:44:59,355 --> 03:45:00,872
So bad was the situation
in Hungary,

2677
03:45:01,304 --> 03:45:03,737
that a group of Hungarian Communists
in Kobanya,

2678
03:45:03,984 --> 03:45:06,665
sent a letter of complaint
to the Soviet authorities.

2679
03:45:07,814 --> 03:45:10,373
In January, when the
Red Army arrived,

2680
03:45:10,666 --> 03:45:14,859
they committed a series of sexual
crimes in an outbreak of savage hatred.

2681
03:45:16,225 --> 03:45:19,941
Drunken soldiers raped mothers in
front of their children and husbands.

2682
03:45:21,186 --> 03:45:24,006
Girls as young as 12, were dragged
from their fathers and mothers

2683
03:45:24,765 --> 03:45:28,060
and raped in succession
by 10 to 15 soldiers.

2684
03:45:28,680 --> 03:45:31,204
From whom many of them caught
venereal diseases.

2685
03:45:35,197 --> 03:45:36,710
THE YALTA AGREEMENT

2686
03:45:37,734 --> 03:45:39,867
In February 1945,
Stalin traveled here

2687
03:45:40,659 --> 03:45:43,344
to Yalta, on the Black Sea, in
the South of the Soviet Union,

2688
03:45:44,583 --> 03:45:47,233
to attend what would become
the most famous meeting of the war.

2689
03:45:49,747 --> 03:45:51,947
But the pressures of the war
had clearly taken their toll

2690
03:45:52,305 --> 03:45:53,673
on one of the leaders
of the Alliance.

2691
03:45:54,771 --> 03:45:59,186
Churchill looked at Roosevelt
so very solicitously.

2692
03:45:59,914 --> 03:46:01,736
Churchill, I suppose,
had no surprise,

2693
03:46:02,559 --> 03:46:07,045
as I had, and anyone else who
had seen Roosevelt previously,

2694
03:46:08,034 --> 03:46:12,248
to see this corked very thin figure.

2695
03:46:12,651 --> 03:46:20,747
His face was waxened, to sort of yellow
and waxened, and very drawn, very thin.

2696
03:46:22,248 --> 03:46:25,002
And a lot of the time
he was sort of sitting

2697
03:46:25,664 --> 03:46:28,769
sitting there with his mouth
open, sort of staring ahead.

2698
03:46:29,808 --> 03:46:32,365
So that was quite a shock
to see him in that state.

2699
03:46:32,880 --> 03:46:36,531
The Allies also decided on the formation
of the United Nations after the war.

2700
03:46:37,604 --> 03:46:40,123
The news reel coverage
was decidedly optimistic.

2701
03:46:41,394 --> 03:46:43,167
This meeting crystallizes the
alive resolve

2702
03:46:43,774 --> 03:46:46,142
that Germany shall be beaten
unconditionally,

2703
03:46:46,693 --> 03:46:50,102
and that lasting peace shall
prevail throughout the world.

2704
03:46:52,466 --> 03:46:54,067
The optimism didn't last long.

2705
03:46:56,424 --> 03:46:58,967
Here in Poland, on
the 28th of March, 1945,

2706
03:46:59,519 --> 03:47:01,837
just a few weeks after signing
the Yalta Agreement,

2707
03:47:02,702 --> 03:47:05,093
the Soviets showed how sincere they
really were

2708
03:47:05,446 --> 03:47:07,662
about Polish political independence.

2709
03:47:13,979 --> 03:47:17,074
Sixteen leading independent political
and military figures in Poland,

2710
03:47:17,538 --> 03:47:21,618
arrived for what they had been told was
to be a lunch, with senior Soviet officials.

2711
03:47:23,533 --> 03:47:25,460
We will be meeting for lunch.

2712
03:47:26,032 --> 03:47:27,980
It's not far away, nine
kilometers from here.

2713
03:47:28,536 --> 03:47:31,869
It's more comfortable then these
primitive conditions.

2714
03:47:36,790 --> 03:47:40,861
They weren't just going on a short journey,
and they weren't just going for lunch.

2715
03:47:43,257 --> 03:47:46,469
In fact they were all transported
over 700 miles to here,

2716
03:47:47,740 --> 03:47:49,636
the Butyrka prison in Moscow.

2717
03:47:54,018 --> 03:47:55,724
The Polish leaders had made
a big mistake.

2718
03:47:56,748 --> 03:47:58,732
They'd trusted the
Soviet authorities.

2719
03:48:03,628 --> 03:48:05,560
Each of them was imprisoned
and interrogated.

2720
03:48:06,911 --> 03:48:10,640
And then they waited to see the
final fate Stalin had in store for them.

2721
03:48:17,629 --> 03:48:20,144
Roosevelt was more relaxed
about the whole dispute with Stalin.

2722
03:48:21,256 --> 03:48:24,512
Just before Yalta, he'd even remarked that
apart from matters concerning Germany,

2723
03:48:25,270 --> 03:48:28,086
he wanted to stay out disputes
in Europe, as far as possible.

2724
03:48:31,286 --> 03:48:33,045
He wrote to Churchill
in early April, that...

2725
03:48:34,105 --> 03:48:38,062
"I would minimize the general Soviet problem
as much as possible, because these problems,

2726
03:48:38,470 --> 03:48:39,453
in one form or another,

2727
03:48:39,861 --> 03:48:43,252
seem to arise every day,
and most of them straighten out."

2728
03:48:45,516 --> 03:48:47,444
Roosevelt was still keen
to get on with Stalin.

2729
03:48:49,124 --> 03:48:50,233
Partly because the Soviet leader

2730
03:48:50,560 --> 03:48:52,496
had offered to help with what
was happening here,

2731
03:48:53,565 --> 03:48:56,244
in the far East, in the
war against Japan.

2732
03:49:01,957 --> 03:49:04,085
American's made up the
bulk of the Allied forces

2733
03:49:04,477 --> 03:49:07,493
who were engaged in the Pacific in
what was known as "Island Hopping",

2734
03:49:08,308 --> 03:49:10,916
the struggle to wrest each
island from the Japanese.

2735
03:49:12,479 --> 03:49:13,916
It was a brutal and bloody war.

2736
03:49:15,035 --> 03:49:16,861
Just 8 days after
the Yalta Agreement,

2737
03:49:17,834 --> 03:49:20,554
the Americans had launched
one of their fiercest assaults here,

2738
03:49:21,413 --> 03:49:25,085
on the Island of Iwo Jima,
750 miles South of Tokyo.

2739
03:49:32,581 --> 03:49:35,827
Just after 9 o'clock in the morning,
on the 19th of February, 1945,

2740
03:49:36,778 --> 03:49:39,351
the first wave of US
Marines landed on the island.

2741
03:49:52,366 --> 03:49:56,452
But the battle for this piece of volcanic rock,
less than 8 miles square, would be horrific

2742
03:49:57,332 --> 03:49:58,354
for both sides.

2743
03:50:05,622 --> 03:50:10,633
Of the 21.000 Japanese defenders,
20.000 would die in the struggle.

2744
03:50:18,413 --> 03:50:23,164
The total American causalities on Iwo Jima,
including wounded, were over 25.000,

2745
03:50:24,314 --> 03:50:25,963
more than the Allies suffered
on D-day.

2746
03:50:26,810 --> 03:50:27,797
"The injured are
carried to the rear."

2747
03:50:28,411 --> 03:50:29,859
So Roosevelt was intensely grateful

2748
03:50:30,259 --> 03:50:33,353
that Stalin had promised the Soviet
Union would help the Western Allies,

2749
03:50:34,254 --> 03:50:37,234
and lend to the war against
Japan, once Germany was defeated.

2750
03:50:37,793 --> 03:50:42,605
"The wreckage along the beach was only a
small part of the cost of 26 days of fighting."

2751
03:50:57,456 --> 03:51:01,009
As for the 16 independent Poles tricked
into meeting the Soviet authorities

2752
03:51:01,383 --> 03:51:02,915
by an offer of lunch,

2753
03:51:03,505 --> 03:51:04,587
they were all put on trial.

2754
03:51:09,586 --> 03:51:12,722
The court investigation exposed

2755
03:51:13,027 --> 03:51:16,019
the full extent of the criminal
activities of the Polish separatist.

2756
03:51:16,908 --> 03:51:18,317
They were acting on the orders

2757
03:51:18,939 --> 03:51:20,248
of the Polish government-in-exile
in London.

2758
03:51:24,511 --> 03:51:29,279
as enemies of democracy, of peace
and of the Polish nation.

2759
03:51:30,781 --> 03:51:35,076
Of the 16, 13 were sentenced
to various terms in Soviet prisons.

2760
03:51:42,875 --> 03:51:44,291
The US will now change their
strategy

2761
03:51:44,669 --> 03:51:46,173
of bombing German industrial
and military targets.

2762
03:51:46,637 --> 03:51:48,597
Insteed, the Americans will join
the British in the bombing of civilians.

2763
03:51:52,184 --> 03:51:54,137
THE DESTRUCTION OF BERLIN

2764
03:51:55,767 --> 03:51:58,018
Reversing years of
American strategic policy,

2765
03:51:58,679 --> 03:52:01,522
would be a massive
air assault on Berlin.

2766
03:52:02,376 --> 03:52:03,183
Over 6 months,

2767
03:52:03,590 --> 03:52:08,386
the head of Bomber Command, sent his
planes on 19 mass attacks on the Nazi capital.

2768
03:52:10,548 --> 03:52:13,250
As many as 800 bombers
on a single mission.

2769
03:52:14,138 --> 03:52:16,664
Nearly 11.000 bombing sorties.

2770
03:52:17,869 --> 03:52:22,360
This attack on Berlin would have
significance far beyond causality numbers.

2771
03:52:25,895 --> 03:52:29,805
With this raid, the 8th Air
Force crosses a moral threshold.

2772
03:52:30,235 --> 03:52:33,702
And that moral threshold is, we
will not deliberately bomb civilians.

2773
03:52:35,863 --> 03:52:39,173
Usually the moral divide
for historians

2774
03:52:40,236 --> 03:52:44,644
is the Tokyo raid, which took place
the next month,

2775
03:52:45,169 --> 03:52:48,441
where we incinerate the city
and kill almost 100.000 people.

2776
03:52:49,169 --> 03:52:50,197
And, but I think,

2777
03:52:52,037 --> 03:52:55,726
once we crossed the moral
divide in Berlin, it made everything else,

2778
03:52:56,054 --> 03:52:57,325
including the Atomic Bomb,
a little bit easier.

2779
03:53:05,390 --> 03:53:08,462
The world must understand that
this state will never surrender

2780
03:53:08,964 --> 03:53:13,404
... the German Reich may
encounter setbacks...

2781
03:53:14,157 --> 03:53:19,008
... but never will it stray
from its chosen path

2782
03:53:20,720 --> 03:53:24,526
The German leadership shares
the hardship endured by its people...

2783
03:53:25,029 --> 03:53:27,723
... but never will it surrender
in the face of hardship

2784
03:53:29,818 --> 03:53:34,211
By spring 1945, the situation had
become all but hopeless for the Germans.

2785
03:53:35,383 --> 03:53:36,992
The Red Army had reached
the river Oder,

2786
03:53:38,290 --> 03:53:40,976
the last great natural obstacle
before Berlin.

2787
03:53:55,606 --> 03:53:58,053
12 April 1945, US President Franklin
D. Roosevelt dies from a brain hemorrhage.

2788
03:54:01,292 --> 03:54:02,333
ROOSEVELT IS DEAD!

2789
03:54:02,656 --> 03:54:05,816
Crowds are lining Constitution
Avenue, from here to the White House.

2790
03:54:07,287 --> 03:54:11,205
All the soldiers and service men in
the crowd, stand firmly at attention.

2791
03:54:13,135 --> 03:54:19,460
And now the caisson will start its solemn
sorrowful procession through Washington.

2792
03:54:24,637 --> 03:54:26,234
His Vice-President Henry A. Wallace,
a known Communist,

2793
03:54:26,666 --> 03:54:28,250
had been quickly and quietly
removed from office

2794
03:54:28,683 --> 03:54:30,262
once it was known Roosevelt's
condition was terminal.

2795
03:54:32,199 --> 03:54:33,470
He is replaced by Harry S. Truman.

2796
03:55:03,051 --> 03:55:04,818
28 April 1945, Guilino di Mezzegra,
Italy

2797
03:55:10,936 --> 03:55:12,926
Italian Communist partisans, capure
Mussolini and his lover Clara Pettacci

2798
03:55:13,359 --> 03:55:15,257
along with several of their
comrades in Northern Italy.

2799
03:55:15,931 --> 03:55:17,704
After a sweeping trial
they were quickly executed.

2800
03:55:19,218 --> 03:55:20,617
However, recent forensic medicine
findings,

2801
03:55:21,103 --> 03:55:22,695
supported by modern digital tehology,

2802
03:55:23,183 --> 03:55:25,210
contradict the official version
of Mussolini's death.

2803
03:55:28,073 --> 03:55:29,751
Photographs and films shot in
April 1945 in Piazzale Loreto

2804
03:55:30,295 --> 03:55:32,117
and examinated at the Institut of
Forensic Medicine, Milan

2805
03:55:32,603 --> 03:55:34,739
conducted that the dictator was
undressed prior to being killed.

2806
03:55:38,617 --> 03:55:40,277
It has long been suspected that
during their 24 hours of captivity

2807
03:55:40,702 --> 03:55:41,615
Mussolini was tortured

2808
03:55:42,070 --> 03:55:44,373
and that Clara Pettacci was raped
several times.

2809
03:56:08,039 --> 03:56:09,614
Their bodies will be brought
to Milan the next day

2810
03:56:10,025 --> 03:56:11,687
where before being hanged
upside down

2811
03:56:12,054 --> 03:56:13,620
in a heinous public display,

2812
03:56:14,048 --> 03:56:16,231
a baying crowd will stamp,
spit and urinate on them.

2813
03:56:48,244 --> 03:56:50,200
Adolf Hitler will hear of Musolini's death
whilst in his Berlin bunker.

2814
03:56:50,644 --> 03:56:52,771
By his side is the ever faitful
Eva Braun.

2815
03:56:53,339 --> 03:56:54,915
He has been there since
16 January 1945,

2816
03:56:55,380 --> 03:56:57,236
surronded by his High Command.

2817
03:57:14,281 --> 03:57:15,753
To be contiued

2818
03:57:22,786 --> 03:57:25,209
Part 17
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

2819
03:57:28,661 --> 03:57:31,494
The sky is literally falling in
on the people of Germany.

2820
03:57:32,114 --> 03:57:35,074
Massive fleets of British and
American heavy bombers,

2821
03:57:35,596 --> 03:57:38,307
pound cities to rubble;
Germany is surrounded.

2822
03:57:39,372 --> 03:57:43,321
From every frontier enemies are
marching on the heart of the Fatherland.

2823
03:57:47,518 --> 03:57:49,211
They are twice as many men
as the Wehrmacht,

2824
03:57:49,770 --> 03:57:51,266
four times as many tanks.

2825
03:57:53,305 --> 03:57:54,655
Hitler knows he is surrounded.

2826
03:57:55,329 --> 03:57:57,257
Old men, women and children

2827
03:57:57,603 --> 03:58:00,314
prepare for a desperate fight
against hopeless odds.

2828
03:58:01,282 --> 03:58:02,421
Yet, at the same time,

2829
03:58:02,925 --> 03:58:07,121
a people who remain astonishingly
loyal in the face of certain defeat.

2830
03:58:08,768 --> 03:58:11,745
Boys of the Hitler youth
ready themselves for battle.

2831
03:58:15,818 --> 03:58:18,305
Ordinary people still
cheer Hitler's armies.

2832
03:58:21,644 --> 03:58:25,035
These troops are all that stand
between Germany and Armageddon.

2833
03:58:31,207 --> 03:58:33,434
Stalin claims he has 6 Million men,

2834
03:58:33,902 --> 03:58:35,379
against less than a million

2835
03:58:35,713 --> 03:58:38,394
armed remnants of every unit
the Reich can muster.

2836
03:58:39,226 --> 03:58:43,327
On the 19th of April, Soviet
troops reach the Berlin suburbs.

2837
03:58:44,091 --> 03:58:46,481
Now it is street fighting,
house by house.

2838
03:58:46,964 --> 03:58:50,217
Everyone a natural redoubt
for desperate defenders.

2839
03:58:56,664 --> 03:58:57,700
Casualties mount.

2840
03:58:58,609 --> 03:59:02,466
Resistance stiffens, but the Soviet
Armies cannot be halted now.

2841
03:59:14,259 --> 03:59:16,980
Hitler's Reich has been pierced
to the heart.

2842
03:59:25,488 --> 03:59:29,089
On the 25th of April,
southern units of Konev's front

2843
03:59:29,597 --> 03:59:32,321
make contact with the United
States forces at the Elbe.

2844
03:59:33,504 --> 03:59:34,980
No hint of future
tensions here.

2845
03:59:38,667 --> 03:59:41,192
Now as Soviet forces converge
on the center of Berlin,

2846
03:59:42,053 --> 03:59:45,277
the fighting embraces everything
and everyone in the battle field.

2847
03:59:52,410 --> 03:59:53,442
Adolf Hitler Square

2848
04:01:04,800 --> 04:01:07,433
But even now, Hitler
has one guardian angel.

2849
04:01:07,533 --> 04:01:08,085
HANNA REITSCH

2850
04:01:08,618 --> 04:01:09,962
Fighter Pilot Hanna Reitsch.

2851
04:01:17,824 --> 04:01:20,588
The only woman to receive an Iron
Cross in the Second World War,

2852
04:01:21,250 --> 04:01:22,984
she is utterly devoted to the Führer.

2853
04:01:26,295 --> 04:01:30,734
On the 29th of April, she pilots her
light aircraft into the heart of Berlin.

2854
04:01:49,013 --> 04:01:50,609
Touching down on the
Unter den Linden,

2855
04:01:51,303 --> 04:01:55,250
she makes the perilous journey through
the mayhem of battle, to Hitler's bunker,

2856
04:01:57,121 --> 04:01:58,302
where he waits the end;

2857
04:01:59,260 --> 04:02:01,453
accompanied by a few
treasured possessions.

2858
04:02:04,211 --> 04:02:09,033
Hanna Reitsch is Hitler's last chance
to escape, but he will not leave.

2859
04:02:09,567 --> 04:02:11,605
He chooses to meet
his destiny in Berlin.

2860
04:02:18,651 --> 04:02:20,170
REICHSKANZLEIBUNKER, BERLIN

2861
04:02:23,566 --> 04:02:25,584
His grand chancellery
now severely damaged,

2862
04:02:26,197 --> 04:02:28,346
he admitted for the
first time that all was lost.

2863
04:02:29,758 --> 04:02:32,914
He then stepped into the passage where
Eva and the secretaries were waiting.

2864
04:02:34,678 --> 04:02:37,227
"All of a sudden the door
was opened, Hitler came out.

2865
04:02:38,174 --> 04:02:39,577
He said everything is lost.

2866
04:02:40,312 --> 04:02:41,518
Pack your things and go,

2867
04:02:42,228 --> 04:02:45,927
you have to leave, and within an hour
the last plane will bring you out.

2868
04:02:50,372 --> 04:02:55,146
After a moment of silence, Eva
Braun stepped forward, went to him,

2869
04:02:55,665 --> 04:02:58,492
took his hand and said,
"but you know I stay with you".

2870
04:03:02,923 --> 04:03:07,016
He smiled, I mean he tried to
smile, and he kissed her on the lips.

2871
04:03:07,542 --> 04:03:10,580
At this moment we all said,
"we're staying too".

2872
04:03:11,563 --> 04:03:13,981
She came towards me, embraced me,
and said,

2873
04:03:14,315 --> 04:03:16,810
"try to go home, try to get out
of here.

2874
04:03:17,571 --> 04:03:20,234
And if you are successful, if
you come to Bavaria back

2875
04:03:20,817 --> 04:03:22,425
give my regards to everybody."

2876
04:03:24,197 --> 04:03:29,930
And she was very sad and I think she
tried to be very brave in this moment.

2877
04:03:34,833 --> 04:03:38,368
He knew what happened to
Mussolini, he saw the pictures.

2878
04:03:39,058 --> 04:03:41,357
And he was very very frightened

2879
04:03:42,117 --> 04:03:45,935
to have the same fate,
if he would be captured."

2880
04:04:43,638 --> 04:04:45,528
The last known phoograph of
Adolf Hitler

2881
04:04:58,280 --> 04:05:00,514
Excerpt from Adolf Hitler's
LAST WILL AND TESTAMENT

2882
04:05:06,657 --> 04:05:12,210
After 6 years of struggle, which in spite
of all reversals will go down in history

2883
04:05:12,697 --> 04:05:17,065
as the most glorious and most courageous
manifestation of a people's will to live.

2884
04:05:18,176 --> 04:05:20,740
I cannot separate myself from
the city,

2885
04:05:21,450 --> 04:05:23,072
which is the capital of this Reich.

2886
04:05:24,264 --> 04:05:27,871
Because our forces are too few
to permit any further resistance

2887
04:05:28,461 --> 04:05:29,634
against the enemies assaults,

2888
04:05:30,263 --> 04:05:32,182
I desire to share the fate

2889
04:05:32,797 --> 04:05:35,789
that millions of others have taken
upon themselves.

2890
04:05:36,476 --> 04:05:38,636
Except I shall remain in this city.

2891
04:05:39,791 --> 04:05:43,957
Furthermore, I do not want to fall
into the hands of enemies

2892
04:05:44,477 --> 04:05:47,601
who for the delectation of
the hate-riddled masses

2893
04:05:48,010 --> 04:05:51,363
require a new spectacle promoted
by the Jews.

2894
04:05:52,430 --> 04:05:54,941
I have therefore resolved
to remain in Berlin

2895
04:05:55,878 --> 04:05:58,593
and there to choose death
of my own will

2896
04:05:59,237 --> 04:06:01,361
at the very moment when,
as I believe,

2897
04:06:02,113 --> 04:06:06,121
the seat of the Führer / Chancellor
can no longer be defended.

2898
04:06:08,023 --> 04:06:10,169
I die with a joyful heart

2899
04:06:10,652 --> 04:06:14,096
in the awareness the immeasurable
deeds and achievements

2900
04:06:14,424 --> 04:06:15,511
of our soldiers at the front,

2901
04:06:16,124 --> 04:06:19,428
of our women at home, the
achievements of our workers,

2902
04:06:20,221 --> 04:06:25,581
of the contribution, unique in history,
of our youth, which bears my name.

2903
04:06:27,595 --> 04:06:28,702
It goes without saying,

2904
04:06:29,277 --> 04:06:32,589
that I thank them all from
the bottom of my heart.

2905
04:07:04,711 --> 04:07:07,204
Defiant to the end, Hitler denounced
Field Marshal Hermann Göring

2906
04:07:07,663 --> 04:07:10,096
and SS chief Heinrich Himmler
as traitors for attempting to negotiate

2907
04:07:10,544 --> 04:07:12,208
with the Allies without his
knowledge.

2908
04:07:13,324 --> 04:07:15,047
Stripping them of their positions,
he hands over

2909
04:07:15,567 --> 04:07:17,167
the leadership of the Third Reich
to navy commander Karl Dönitz.

2910
04:07:33,245 --> 04:07:34,697
The Final Days

2911
04:07:40,111 --> 04:07:45,008
On April the 29th, Hitler decided
to marry his mistress Eva Braun.

2912
04:07:45,871 --> 04:07:49,381
After the bridal couple had confirmed
they were of true Aryan decent,

2913
04:07:50,020 --> 04:07:53,265
the ceremony was concluded with
Goebbels and Bormann as the witnesses.

2914
04:07:54,421 --> 04:07:58,010
Hitler signed the wedding certificate,
but when it came to Eva's turn,

2915
04:07:58,501 --> 04:08:00,597
she began to write her
surname as "Braun"

2916
04:08:01,329 --> 04:08:05,304
before crossing out the letter
"B", and writing Eva Hitler.

2917
04:08:09,551 --> 04:08:13,128
Arm in arm, Adolf Hitler led his bride
to the study for the wedding reception.

2918
04:08:14,282 --> 04:08:14,824
Traudl Junge:

2919
04:08:15,135 --> 04:08:20,543
"As a gesture of gratitude for her
love, for her royalty, for her fidelity,

2920
04:08:22,139 --> 04:08:25,992
and I think he wanted to
compensate her for

2921
04:08:27,632 --> 04:08:30,768
to get the figure of history
as his wife."

2922
04:08:32,832 --> 04:08:33,412
30 APRIL 1945, BERLIN

2923
04:08:33,690 --> 04:08:36,108
Less than 2 days after the
wedding on April the 30th,

2924
04:08:36,722 --> 04:08:39,908
Hitler and his bride
retired to his study. Traudl Junge:

2925
04:08:40,252 --> 04:08:46,905
"And there he stood, very quite,
very tired, and then he turned and I,

2926
04:08:47,801 --> 04:08:53,315
I felt somehow's like
frozen, because I knew now

2927
04:08:54,008 --> 04:08:58,679
that this decisive moment where we
were going to see soon he'd end his life."

2928
04:09:00,135 --> 04:09:01,063
They sat on the couch.

2929
04:09:01,726 --> 04:09:03,761
Opposite them was a portrait
of Hitler's mother.

2930
04:09:04,960 --> 04:09:06,549
Eva now took a cyanide capsule

2931
04:09:07,163 --> 04:09:10,291
and popped it into her mouth.
She died instantly.

2932
04:09:13,401 --> 04:09:14,469
Then Hitler picked up his gun,

2933
04:09:15,180 --> 04:09:17,332
put it to his right temple,
and fired.

2934
04:09:19,878 --> 04:09:21,732
Acting in accordance with Hitler's
instructions,

2935
04:09:22,312 --> 04:09:24,749
members of his staff wrapped both
the bodies in blankets,

2936
04:09:25,165 --> 04:09:26,518
and carried them up to
the surface.

2937
04:09:29,505 --> 04:09:31,052
During a pause in
the Russian shelling,

2938
04:09:31,354 --> 04:09:33,893
they doused the bodies with what
petrol they had managed to collect,

2939
04:09:34,476 --> 04:09:35,523
and set them alight.

2940
04:10:34,362 --> 04:10:38,075
The strugle between the people
and hatred between them...

2941
04:10:38,867 --> 04:10:42,395
... is being nurtured by very
specific interested parties.

2942
04:10:43,171 --> 04:10:47,135
It is a small rootless international
clique

2943
04:10:47,927 --> 04:10:49,561
that is turning people against
each other...

2944
04:10:50,509 --> 04:10:52,663
... that does not want them
to have peace!

2945
04:10:54,941 --> 04:10:57,595
It is a people who are at home
nowhere and everywhere!

2946
04:10:58,134 --> 04:11:02,027
Who do not have anywhere a soil
on which they have grown up...

2947
04:11:02,524 --> 04:11:04,532
... but who live in Berlin today...

2948
04:11:05,344 --> 04:11:12,092
... Brussels tomorrow, Paris the day after,
then Prag, Viena or London...

2949
04:11:12,506 --> 04:11:15,123
... and who feel at home everywhere!

2950
04:11:17,707 --> 04:11:22,205
They are the ones who can really
be regarded as international elements...

2951
04:11:22,550 --> 04:11:25,845
... because they conduct their
business everywhere!

2952
04:11:35,441 --> 04:11:37,398
"At the very end of his life,
to be sure, his back had become bent,

2953
04:11:37,855 --> 04:11:39,807
but his mind remained as clear
as a flash of lightning.

2954
04:11:40,282 --> 04:11:41,804
When has history ever vitnessed
so enormous

2955
04:11:42,212 --> 04:11:44,116
a tragedy brought to its end
with such iron self-control?

2956
04:11:44,829 --> 04:11:46,710
General Léon Degrelle

2957
04:12:27,724 --> 04:12:29,779
To be continued

2958
04:12:35,724 --> 04:12:38,732
Part 18
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

2959
04:12:43,123 --> 04:12:45,207
In 73 A.D. a huge Roman army lay
siege to 1000 rebel Jews

2960
04:12:45,621 --> 04:12:46,580
and their families,

2961
04:12:47,075 --> 04:12:48,508
in the mountain hideaway
of Masada.

2962
04:12:50,983 --> 04:12:53,143
On the eve of the batlle, and fearing
the rape of their women

2963
04:12:53,600 --> 04:12:55,464
an enslavement of their children,
the men to avoid surrender

2964
04:12:55,951 --> 04:12:57,374
drew straws to decide

2965
04:12:57,830 --> 04:12:59,574
which of them would kill
their loves ones.

2966
04:13:01,791 --> 04:13:03,670
Once the killigs were completed
the men commited suicide,

2967
04:13:04,325 --> 04:13:06,998
leaving the Romans to find not
a single survivor the following day.

2968
04:13:11,434 --> 04:13:13,978
Today in Israel, they are remembered
as heroic martyrs.

2969
04:13:37,060 --> 04:13:38,459
CENTRAL BERLIN 1945

2970
04:15:01,113 --> 04:15:03,305
April 1945 inside the Reichskanzleibunker,
Joseph Goebbels loyal to the end,

2971
04:15:03,765 --> 04:15:05,246
is fully aware that the Bolsheviks
are raining death

2972
04:15:05,821 --> 04:15:07,362
and destruction on the
population outside.

2973
04:15:08,350 --> 04:15:09,744
With him is his wife Magda
and their six children.

2974
04:15:10,145 --> 04:15:11,313
And although they are safe
for now,

2975
04:15:11,753 --> 04:15:13,076
with the Soviets just hundreds
of yards away,

2976
04:15:13,502 --> 04:15:15,029
he knows that time is
running out.

2977
04:15:15,844 --> 04:15:17,676
They too, will choose death for
themselves and their six children

2978
04:15:18,138 --> 04:15:19,772
rather than risk escaping
brutality of the Commuists.

2979
04:15:21,380 --> 04:15:23,206
Under such circumstances, Magda
cannot trust anyone else

2980
04:15:23,653 --> 04:15:25,252
with the responsibility of
her children's lives.

2981
04:15:25,763 --> 04:15:26,892
Now she must steel herself

2982
04:15:27,387 --> 04:15:29,091
for what must be every mother's
worst nightmare.

2983
04:15:29,792 --> 04:15:31,376
Not once but six times over.

2984
04:16:28,845 --> 04:16:30,785
On 1 May 1945, Joseph and Magda
Goebbels will commit suicide.

2985
04:16:31,193 --> 04:16:32,778
The history books will not
treat them as kindly,

2986
04:16:33,281 --> 04:16:35,185
nor view them as herically,
as the Masada martyrs.

2987
04:16:35,720 --> 04:16:37,355
Magda especially, will be portrayed
by the media

2988
04:16:37,755 --> 04:16:38,858
and in future Hollywood movies

2989
04:16:39,388 --> 04:16:41,001
as a sinister perpetrator
of evil.

2990
04:17:03,121 --> 04:17:05,210
"A mothers love for her child
is like nothing else in the world.

2991
04:17:05,721 --> 04:17:07,137
It knows no law, it knows no pity.
It dares all things

2992
04:17:07,694 --> 04:17:09,645
and crushes down remorselessly
all that stands in its path."

2993
04:17:23,550 --> 04:17:25,058
GERMANY IS DEFEATED

2994
04:19:23,100 --> 04:19:24,548
On 7 May 1945, Germany officially
surrenders.

2995
04:19:25,492 --> 04:19:27,574
Fighting continues in the Balkans
where German soldiers and Croat fighers,

2996
04:19:28,038 --> 04:19:29,846
many with their families, continue
their battle

2997
04:19:30,287 --> 04:19:32,470
against pursuing Communist partisans
in a strugge to reach the Austrian border

2998
04:19:32,938 --> 04:19:34,675
and surrender to the Western
Allies.

2999
04:20:04,679 --> 04:20:05,734
Berlin has Fallen.

3000
04:20:07,363 --> 04:20:10,399
Marshall Stalin has just announced
the complete capture of

3001
04:20:11,029 --> 04:20:12,215
the capital of Germany.

3002
04:20:12,894 --> 04:20:14,690
There are some reports that
Hitler died;

3003
04:20:15,170 --> 04:20:17,210
result of a stroke suffered
several days ago.

3004
04:20:17,857 --> 04:20:20,198
There are other reports that
Hitler was not in Berlin at all.

3005
04:20:20,943 --> 04:20:23,166
That he's been hiding out,
and that he may still be alive.

3006
04:20:23,828 --> 04:20:27,910
That the German story of his death is
only a rouse to permit him to escape.

3007
04:20:29,235 --> 04:20:30,971
Many today believe that Hitler
escaped

3008
04:20:36,113 --> 04:20:37,277
THE AUSTRIAN BORDER 1945

3009
04:20:42,157 --> 04:20:43,500
THE BLEIBURG MASSACRE

3010
04:20:47,396 --> 04:20:51,143
If people are told the truth,
about where they're going,

3011
04:20:51,711 --> 04:20:52,379
Capt. Nigel Nicolson - British 8th Army

3012
04:20:52,663 --> 04:20:56,631
and they refuse to go,
because they will be killed,

3013
04:20:57,608 --> 04:20:59,708
the only way to get them
onto the trains,

3014
04:21:00,629 --> 04:21:02,995
is to lie to them about their
destination.

3015
04:21:18,945 --> 04:21:20,612
And of course if they'd learned
the truth,

3016
04:21:21,043 --> 04:21:24,785
that they were going back to Yugoslavia
where they didn't expect to survive,

3017
04:21:26,035 --> 04:21:28,966
none of them would have
consented to mount the railway tracks.

3018
04:21:32,678 --> 04:21:39,213
Now, I remember asking for...
advice from the division.

3019
04:21:40,606 --> 04:21:43,797
Are we to send the civilians
as well?

3020
04:21:45,084 --> 04:21:46,161
And the answer came back...

3021
04:21:47,167 --> 04:21:47,944
Yes.

3022
04:21:49,322 --> 04:21:50,818
WAR CRIME

3023
04:21:52,949 --> 04:21:57,214
There were women and children,
and old men, and sometimes babies,

3024
04:21:57,721 --> 04:22:01,504
who were in these convoys,
which we organized.

3025
04:22:03,827 --> 04:22:05,136
But did you hear the machine guns?
- Yes.

3026
04:22:06,978 --> 04:22:07,826
Capt. Colin Gunner - British 8th Army

3027
04:22:09,718 --> 04:22:11,176
On the Yugoslav side of the border?

3028
04:22:11,508 --> 04:22:13,144
Oh for Christ sake!

3029
04:22:15,460 --> 04:22:20,697
Do you think I like to talk about
fucking kids being shot down?!

3030
04:22:27,307 --> 04:22:28,633
At Yalta, Churchill, Roosevelt
and Stalin had agreed

3031
04:22:29,033 --> 04:22:30,439
to forced repatriation of
enemy POWs and refugees.

3032
04:22:30,466 --> 04:22:31,914
Although the US signed international
agreemets opposing forced repatriation,

3033
04:22:32,361 --> 04:22:34,051
they inserted fine print
expecting from the ban

3034
04:22:34,463 --> 04:22:35,907
all those who originated from nations

3035
04:22:36,353 --> 04:22:38,049
given over to the Soviets
at the end of the war.

3036
04:22:38,631 --> 04:22:40,496
While claiming to "make the world safe
for Democracy", Roosevelt and Churchill

3037
04:22:40,951 --> 04:22:42,791
condemned millions to slave
labour camps and certain death.

3038
04:22:43,731 --> 04:22:45,289
The Allies even kept secret from
the world fact

3039
04:22:45,735 --> 04:22:47,421
that Stalin was holding over
5.000 Allied soldiers as hostages

3040
04:22:47,853 --> 04:22:49,661
to ensure that the West complied
with his demands for repatriation.

3041
04:23:15,750 --> 04:23:18,587
"And then for the next 5 days,

3042
04:23:19,641 --> 04:23:25,084
we organized trainloads of Croats
to go to Yugoslavia.

3043
04:23:31,513 --> 04:23:38,816
But ah, as they trusted us, when
we were telling them the truth,

3044
04:23:40,368 --> 04:23:43,165
there wasn't much trouble
about loading them on."

3045
04:23:45,011 --> 04:23:45,952
OPERATION KEELHAUL

3046
04:23:47,110 --> 04:23:48,418
Whilst searching through US
military archives

3047
04:23:48,912 --> 04:23:50,688
for the Cogressional investigation of
the State Department cover-up

3048
04:23:51,146 --> 04:23:52,473
of Soviet involvement in the
Katyn Forest massacre,

3049
04:23:52,860 --> 04:23:54,469
researcher Julius Epstein discovered
evidence

3050
04:23:54,925 --> 04:23:56,589
of a top secret program of forced
repatriation known as

3051
04:23:57,037 --> 04:23:58,163
Operation Keelhaul.

3052
04:23:59,989 --> 04:24:01,830
US and British troops had to beat,
drug and drive at gunpoint

3053
04:24:02,246 --> 04:24:03,890
millions of civilians back
to the Communists.

3054
04:24:06,171 --> 04:24:08,094
In spite of this, Stalin never did
release the American and British POWs.

3055
04:24:08,634 --> 04:24:10,475
It is suspected they perished
in the Gulags, as the US still

3056
04:24:11,800 --> 04:24:13,439
refuses to open the archives
revealing their fate.

3057
04:24:27,004 --> 04:24:28,617
THE ALLIES MISTREATMENT OF
GERMAN PRISONERS

3058
04:24:36,960 --> 04:24:38,864
Unlike the Soviets, the Allies
had signed on

3059
04:24:39,368 --> 04:24:40,526
to the Geneva Convention of 1929.

3060
04:24:40,984 --> 04:24:42,680
But by reclassifaing the German
POWs as "disarmed enemy forces",

3061
04:24:43,127 --> 04:24:44,960
they had now found a way
of cicumventing the rules.

3062
04:24:45,764 --> 04:24:47,348
The British, French and Americans
will now block any attempt

3063
04:24:47,802 --> 04:24:49,630
by the International Red Cross
from checking that the prisoners

3064
04:24:50,066 --> 04:24:51,694
are treated according to
international law

3065
04:24:52,206 --> 04:24:53,462
in Allied camps across Germany.

3066
04:24:56,555 --> 04:24:58,673
Eisenhower's mistreatment of prisoners
in the Rhine Meadow concentration camps,

3067
04:24:59,138 --> 04:25:00,717
where they held under appalling
conditions,

3068
04:25:01,205 --> 04:25:03,157
have only recently come to
light.

3069
04:25:04,828 --> 04:25:06,431
It is now estimated that at
least 1.5 million soldiers

3070
04:25:06,942 --> 04:25:09,021
and civilian POWs died whilst
in Allied captivity.

3071
04:25:19,883 --> 04:25:21,316
"This is Deanna Spingola.

3072
04:25:22,170 --> 04:25:25,433
Today I'm going to share some
details about World War 2,

3073
04:25:26,213 --> 04:25:28,918
that many of you might
not have heard before.

3074
04:25:29,522 --> 04:25:33,624
I base this information on the hundreds
of hours of research that I have done.

3075
04:25:34,678 --> 04:25:36,638
Eisenhower's Death Camps.

3076
04:25:37,227 --> 04:25:40,003
In a letter to his wife Eisenhower
said,

3077
04:25:40,413 --> 04:25:42,945
and this is the quote,
"God I hate the Germans!

3078
04:25:43,341 --> 04:25:46,072
Why? Because the
German is a beast", unquote.

3079
04:25:46,993 --> 04:25:51,756
He suggested a new class of
prisoner, Disarmed Enemy Forces,

3080
04:25:52,352 --> 04:25:54,478
prisoners the army would not feed.

3081
04:25:55,640 --> 04:25:59,431
Get that? They would not feed!
after Germany's surrender.

3082
04:26:00,169 --> 04:26:01,428
Food, water and shelter,

3083
04:26:01,975 --> 04:26:05,449
basic human necessities,
were unavailable in the camps;

3084
04:26:06,141 --> 04:26:08,041
per Eisenhower's orders!

3085
04:26:09,258 --> 04:26:09,990
Excuse me.

3086
04:26:11,126 --> 04:26:16,554
On April 22nd, 1945,
the US had in Europe,

3087
04:26:17,119 --> 04:26:23,543
50 days worth of 4.000 calorie
rations to feed 5 million people

3088
04:26:24,419 --> 04:26:26,645
for an additional 50 days!

3089
04:26:27,177 --> 04:26:28,276
They had the food,

3090
04:26:28,673 --> 04:26:31,555
they just chose not to give it!

3091
04:26:32,655 --> 04:26:37,328
On April 26th, 1945, the combined
Chiefs Of Staff in Washington,

3092
04:26:37,977 --> 04:26:42,870
cabled Eisenhower their approval of
the Disarmed Enemy Forces status,

3093
04:26:43,517 --> 04:26:46,165
for ALL German citizens!

3094
04:26:47,041 --> 04:26:49,102
Everybody was considered an enemy!

3095
04:26:50,690 --> 04:26:57,183
By April 30th 1945, there was
an additional 2.062,865

3096
04:26:57,808 --> 04:27:00,103
of these CIVILIAN prisoners.

3097
04:27:00,674 --> 04:27:06,234
Author Giles Macdonogh wrote,
that at least 1.5 million Germans

3098
04:27:06,662 --> 04:27:10,549
died in those camps due to
their ill-treatment and starvation.

3099
04:27:11,268 --> 04:27:19,514
In contrast in 1945 the American Red
Cross said that "99% of the US POWs

3100
04:27:20,154 --> 04:27:25,026
held in German camps had survived
and were soon returning home."

3101
04:27:28,469 --> 04:27:31,587
I was a US Army Guard at a
German Prison Camp in Andernach.

3102
04:27:32,642 --> 04:27:36,365
And I was uh silent
for 45 years because uh

3103
04:27:37,414 --> 04:27:38,478
I was warned

3104
04:27:39,180 --> 04:27:40,620
it would be futile
to say anything,

3105
04:27:41,073 --> 04:27:43,246
and that I would be in
serious trouble if I did.

3106
04:27:51,627 --> 04:27:53,205
To be continued

Part 19
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

3108
04:28:03,302 --> 04:28:05,137
LONDON, ENGLAND
8 MAY 1945

3109
04:28:13,016 --> 04:28:14,077
Victory in Europe.

04:28:14,867 --> 04:28:15,767
V- E Day.

3111
04:28:21,051 --> 04:28:25,720
We may allow ourselves
a brief period of rejoice.

3112
04:28:30,122 --> 04:28:31,702
But let us not forget for
a moment

3113
04:28:32,244 --> 04:28:35,702
the toils and efforts that
lie ahead.

3114
04:28:38,730 --> 04:28:43,829
Japan with all her treachery
and greed remains unsubdued.

3115
04:28:48,402 --> 04:28:51,642
In Asia and the Pacific
the war still raged.

3116
04:30:39,792 --> 04:30:41,659
HIROSHIMA, JAPAN
6 AUGUST 1945

3117
04:30:51,954 --> 04:30:53,464
BERLIN, GERMANY

3118
04:30:57,502 --> 04:31:01,339
In the wake of its unconditional
surrender on the 7th of May, 1945,

3119
04:31:01,864 --> 04:31:03,447
Germany lay vanquished.

3120
04:31:04,116 --> 04:31:05,338
Millions had died.

3121
04:31:06,046 --> 04:31:08,730
Those that survived had
suffered terribly during the conflict,

3122
04:31:09,248 --> 04:31:11,417
both in combat and
on the home front.

3123
04:31:15,996 --> 04:31:18,940
Intensive Allied bombing raids
and the ground battle for Germany,

3124
04:31:19,553 --> 04:31:21,931
had forced millions of Germans
from their homes.

3125
04:31:23,955 --> 04:31:25,800
On the 5th of June, 1945,

3126
04:31:26,461 --> 04:31:30,461
the Allies announced they would govern
Germany through 4 occupation zones.

3127
04:31:31,085 --> 04:31:32,537
One for each of the 4 powers.

3128
04:31:33,473 --> 04:31:38,551
The Soviet Union, Britain, the
United States, and France.

3129
04:31:39,480 --> 04:31:42,230
Following the war, hundreds of
thousands of former soldiers,

3130
04:31:42,660 --> 04:31:45,702
Nazi party members,
were held in POW camps.

3131
04:31:46,229 --> 04:31:50,113
Thousands of officers and members
of the Nazi party remained imprisoned.

3132
04:31:50,692 --> 04:31:53,452
Their fate a trial
for war crimes.

3133
04:31:58,120 --> 04:32:00,113
THE ALLIED LIBERATION OF
POW CAMPS

3134
04:32:14,574 --> 04:32:15,890
BUCHENWALD, GERMANY

3135
04:32:18,609 --> 04:32:20,566
The US army forced the local population
to file through the camp

3136
04:32:21,016 --> 04:32:22,656
to view the horrors they had
ecountered upon arrival.

3137
04:32:23,050 --> 04:32:24,729
The sight and stench of thousands of
emaciated and naked corpes

3138
04:32:25,191 --> 04:32:26,981
will also be experienced by the
British at the Bergen-Belsen camp

3139
04:32:27,454 --> 04:32:29,044
and others across Europe.

3140
04:32:53,662 --> 04:32:55,562
Only months before, the Bolsheviks had
claimed they had discovered

3141
04:32:56,094 --> 04:32:57,954
homicidal gas chambers i camps
across eatern Europe.

3142
04:32:59,367 --> 04:33:01,264
This, as the Germans are purposely
led around camps shocked,

3143
04:33:01,753 --> 04:33:03,404
dazed and bewildered, will mark
the beginning

3144
04:33:03,880 --> 04:33:05,867
of what will become known as
de-Nazifiction.

3145
04:33:18,215 --> 04:33:20,004
The Americans claim they have
even more evidence of atrocities.

3146
04:33:20,504 --> 04:33:22,918
A lampshade made from human
skin, two shrunken Polish prisoer's heads

3147
04:33:23,390 --> 04:33:25,299
and pieces of tattooed skin
are displayed

3148
04:33:25,923 --> 04:33:27,856
for an already sickening crowd.

3149
04:33:29,398 --> 04:33:31,684
There will soon be sories of humans
used for soap,

3150
04:33:32,395 --> 04:33:34,227
and even more homocidal gas
chambers discovered,

3151
04:33:34,804 --> 04:33:36,788
this time in the camps
iberated by the Allies.

3152
04:34:23,917 --> 04:34:26,095
THE DACHAU MASSACRES

3153
04:34:30,946 --> 04:34:31,749
Within the first hour of the
liberaion

3154
04:34:32,221 --> 04:34:33,701
of the Dachau POW camp
Northwest of Munich,

3155
04:34:34,194 --> 04:34:36,077
122 SS guards are shot after
surrendering to the US 45th Division.

3156
04:34:36,511 --> 04:34:38,302
Another 40 SS are beaten to
death by inmates.

3157
04:34:52,053 --> 04:34:53,701
A further 358 SS men will be
rounded up

3158
04:34:54,182 --> 04:34:55,917
and herded into an encosed
coal yard.

3159
04:34:56,547 --> 04:34:58,213
Initially, 12 are machine-gunned.

3160
04:35:13,228 --> 04:35:15,384
The rest are executed shoortly
thereafter.

3161
04:35:26,754 --> 04:35:28,324
In total, 560 SS men who had
surrendered

3162
04:35:28,840 --> 04:35:30,501
were murdered during the
liberation of Dachau.

3163
04:35:31,069 --> 04:35:32,630
The only punishment for the
US soldiers involved in the executions

3164
04:35:33,148 --> 04:35:34,637
was the threat of a court-martial.

3165
04:35:41,322 --> 04:35:43,696
Despit claims from prisoners
and the US soldiers who liberated them,

3166
04:35:44,117 --> 04:35:46,084
a sign at Dachau will later
begrudgingly read...

3167
04:35:46,563 --> 04:35:48,077
No gassing ever took place.

3168
04:36:03,298 --> 04:36:04,921
THE NUREMBERG TRIAL

3169
04:36:10,790 --> 04:36:12,461
Admiral Karl Dönitz and the NSDAP
leaders are arrested

3170
04:36:12,928 --> 04:36:14,632
and placed on trial for alleged
war crimes.

3171
04:36:14,633 --> 04:36:16,363
It is an event unprecendendted
in history.

3172
04:36:16,848 --> 04:36:18,416
For the first time ever, members
of a government defeated in war

3173
04:36:18,847 --> 04:36:19,964
will now stand trial for
their lives.

3174
04:36:20,486 --> 04:36:21,744
In the court room will be four
judges, one each from the

3175
04:36:22,202 --> 04:36:23,801
US, Britain, France and the
Soviet Union.

3176
04:36:29,786 --> 04:36:31,145
Admiral Karl Dönitz

3177
04:36:34,928 --> 04:36:36,551
The wer crimes of Stalin are
covered up,

3178
04:36:37,112 --> 04:36:39,385
and will only come to light
when the Soviet Union colapses

3179
04:36:39,837 --> 04:36:41,170
over half a century later.

3180
04:36:41,859 --> 04:36:43,212
Roosevelt and Churchill deliberate
bombing of German civilians

3181
04:36:43,594 --> 04:36:46,011
in Dresden, Hamburg and Berlin
are never recognised as war crimes.

3182
04:36:49,375 --> 04:36:50,958
You can light a
fag on any of those.

3183
04:36:51,624 --> 04:36:52,376
Bombs doors open.

3184
04:36:52,776 --> 04:36:55,160
Bombs doors open.
Bombs away.

3185
04:36:55,552 --> 04:36:56,912
There goes the cookie.

3186
04:36:57,764 --> 04:36:59,114
There go the incendiaries.

3187
04:37:01,741 --> 04:37:03,419
The Allies will use hanging as
a method of execution, a practice

3188
04:37:03,769 --> 04:37:05,224
usually associated with a common
criminal or murderer

3189
04:37:05,608 --> 04:37:06,785
and not a military tribunal.

3190
04:37:07,805 --> 04:37:09,026
Head of the SS Heinrich Himmler
will escape the hangman

3191
04:37:09,442 --> 04:37:10,850
by swallowing cyanide after
his arrest.

3192
04:37:12,857 --> 04:37:14,520
A capsule is also discovered
on Herman Göring.

3193
04:37:14,947 --> 04:37:16,678
He will stand trial however,
and his commanding presence

3194
04:37:17,173 --> 04:37:18,870
will dominate the proceedings.

3195
04:37:29,169 --> 04:37:32,501
What struck you when you
first met him, was his bearing.

3196
04:37:33,463 --> 04:37:36,321
He was a commanding
personality; you were impressed.

3197
04:37:36,733 --> 04:37:38,602
You knew that somebody
important was there.

3198
04:37:41,357 --> 04:37:44,977
Whenever the prisoners
where in their cells

3199
04:37:45,281 --> 04:37:46,227
H. Göering

3200
04:37:46,262 --> 04:37:51,042
they were constantly under
observation; every minute of it.

3201
04:37:53,170 --> 04:37:54,978
As expected, the majority of verdicts
are announced as guilty,

3202
04:37:55,506 --> 04:37:57,546
and the leading National Socialist
receive either the death penalty

3203
04:37:57,939 --> 04:37:59,233
or long prison sentences.

3204
04:38:00,102 --> 04:38:02,285
After being accused a request for
a "soldier's death" by firing squad,

3205
04:38:02,669 --> 04:38:04,347
Hermann Göering hours away from
his execution,

3206
04:38:04,877 --> 04:38:07,512
will also cheat the hangman.

3207
04:38:08,585 --> 04:38:10,310
To this day, it is a mistery
how he was able

3208
04:38:10,750 --> 04:38:12,214
to obtain the required cyanide.

3209
04:38:25,967 --> 04:38:27,578
The ethnic cleansig of National Socialist
will now commence with a witch-hunt

3210
04:38:28,025 --> 04:38:30,401
against German military leaders,
political officials, industrialist and financiers.

3211
04:38:31,883 --> 04:38:32,966
Many of the hangings go
so horribly wrong,

3212
04:38:33,398 --> 04:38:34,574
with some deaths taking
between 20-30 minutes,

3213
04:38:35,835 --> 04:38:37,035
that the British Army will request
the services

3214
04:38:37,458 --> 04:38:39,530
of Britain's top criminal hangman
Albert Pierrepoint.

3215
04:38:49,849 --> 04:38:51,505
Pierrepiont, good
to see you again.

3216
04:38:52,235 --> 04:38:55,815
We've had the gallows constructed
to home office specifications,

3217
04:38:56,581 --> 04:38:57,814
as you've requested.

3218
04:38:58,627 --> 04:39:02,691
And here's the list of tomorrow's
condemned prisoners.

3219
04:39:06,059 --> 04:39:07,384
13 in one day.

3220
04:39:08,908 --> 04:39:10,660
No Sir. I'm not
with you Sir.

3221
04:39:11,081 --> 04:39:13,123
I thought we had a
week to do this job?

3222
04:39:13,503 --> 04:39:17,228
Well yes, but there are
different batches each day.

3223
04:39:19,045 --> 04:39:21,746
Well, how many
others are there, Sir?

3224
04:39:24,218 --> 04:39:26,490
47 in total.

3225
04:39:27,213 --> 04:39:28,079
47?

3226
04:39:28,575 --> 04:39:29,991
That's just this week.

3227
04:39:30,869 --> 04:39:33,606
I'm afraid you'll find
them coming thicker fast,

3228
04:39:33,713 --> 04:39:35,734
now that the courts have
delivered their verdicts.

3229
04:39:38,318 --> 04:39:39,100
Jolly good.

3230
04:39:43,989 --> 04:39:45,556
196 pounds.

3231
04:39:48,426 --> 04:39:49,467
Irma Grese.

3232
04:39:51,207 --> 04:39:52,899
Keiner unterhaltung.

3233
04:40:00,326 --> 04:40:02,213
Uh... 5' 3"

3234
04:40:04,109 --> 04:40:05,898
You do the Jews work for them.

3235
04:40:10,639 --> 04:40:11,668
Stehen bleiben.

3236
04:40:12,746 --> 04:40:13,726
113 pounds

3237
04:40:18,862 --> 04:40:19,853
That's the last of them.

3238
04:41:52,913 --> 04:41:53,937
Time for a break?

3239
04:41:57,111 --> 04:41:59,703
No, we don't want to fall behind.

3240
04:42:44,076 --> 04:42:45,572
To be continued

3241
04:42:51,666 --> 04:42:54,304
Part 20
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

3242
04:43:00,418 --> 04:43:01,967
CONFESSION BY TORTURE

3243
04:43:10,182 --> 04:43:11,742
Recently released documents disprove
decades of denial, and show

3244
04:43:12,144 --> 04:43:13,929
that the Germans suffered horribly
whilst in British captivity.

3245
04:43:14,739 --> 04:43:16,628
Thousands of Germans passed through
the unit known as the London Cage,

3246
04:43:17,148 --> 04:43:18,770
run by Lieutenant Colonel
Aexander Scotland.

3247
04:43:21,389 --> 04:43:22,897
The London Cage was just one
of a series of nine cages in Britain

3248
04:43:23,289 --> 04:43:25,000
where the torture of Germans
took place.

3249
04:43:40,003 --> 04:43:41,558
At Nuremberg in 1946, the Allie's
"star witness" was Rudof Höss,

3250
04:43:41,983 --> 04:43:43,813
former commandant at Auschwitz,
who they claimed had confessed

3251
04:43:44,239 --> 04:43:45,945
to exterminaing over
3 million Jews.

3252
04:43:47,957 --> 04:43:49,471
Film of emaciated bodies used as
evidence of German atrocities

3253
04:43:49,878 --> 04:43:50,951
is intentionally misleading.

3254
04:43:51,383 --> 04:43:53,669
The Allies know that most of
the inmates perished from typhus...

3255
04:44:01,743 --> 04:44:04,884
Zyklon B dropped into the death
chamber from a small opening.

3256
04:44:06,019 --> 04:44:08,000
It took from 3 to 15 minutes.

3257
04:44:09,476 --> 04:44:10,100
15 DE ABRIL DE 1946

3258
04:44:10,135 --> 04:44:12,965
We knew when the people were
dead because their screaming stopped.

3259
04:44:14,739 --> 04:44:19,084
After the bodies were removed our
special commandos took off the rings

3260
04:44:19,476 --> 04:44:22,240
and extracted the gold
from the teeth of the corpses.

3261
04:44:22,482 --> 04:44:23,565
Jesus

3262
04:44:25,714 --> 04:44:28,759
Children of tender years
were invariably exterminated

3263
04:44:30,867 --> 04:44:33,699
since by reason of their
youth they were unable to work.

3264
04:44:38,475 --> 04:44:40,040
Is that all true and correct
witness?

3265
04:44:42,314 --> 04:44:43,400
Yes.

3266
04:44:46,903 --> 04:44:49,219
It was the British who obtained
by torture

3267
04:44:49,620 --> 04:44:51,500
the confession of Rudolf Hoess,

3268
04:44:51,859 --> 04:44:56,172
Commandant of Auschwitz, before
turning him over to Soviets and Poles.

3269
04:44:56,612 --> 04:44:59,476
This has been confirmed in a book
published in 1983

3270
04:44:59,940 --> 04:45:01,335
titled "Legions of Death",

3271
04:45:01,927 --> 04:45:05,373
which contains the recollections
of British sergeant Bernard Clark,

3272
04:45:06,067 --> 04:45:08,219
who brags about having tortured
Hoess,

3273
04:45:08,572 --> 04:45:09,907
to get a confession out of him,

3274
04:45:10,400 --> 04:45:11,626
and of threatening his family.

3275
04:45:15,011 --> 04:45:17,724
It was here that Hoess was hanged.

3276
04:45:18,216 --> 04:45:19,094
Auschwitz

3277
04:45:28,399 --> 04:45:29,921
Modern science will ultimately
determine the horrific claims

3278
04:45:30,297 --> 04:45:31,987
from Buchenwald and Bergen-Belson
to be Allied propaganda.

3279
04:45:32,466 --> 04:45:34,018
To this day, many believe them
to be true.

3280
04:45:35,569 --> 04:45:37,168
DNA testing proves that the
Dachau lampshade are goatskin.

3281
04:45:37,653 --> 04:45:38,709
And the two shrunken heads?

3282
04:45:39,179 --> 04:45:41,299
They conveniently disappeared
before they could be tested.

3283
04:45:43,461 --> 04:45:44,847
And though other stories -
such as articles made from

3284
04:45:45,279 --> 04:45:46,710
"human tattooed skin" -
are equally false,

3285
04:45:47,187 --> 04:45:48,995
they remain embedded in
Holocaust mythology.

3286
04:46:04,108 --> 04:46:05,763
Only in Eastern Europian camps,
where no invesigation ever occured

3287
04:46:06,244 --> 04:46:08,004
or where alowed, is it
still claimed

3288
04:46:08,507 --> 04:46:10,163
that millions of Jews entered
the gas chambers.

3289
04:46:14,267 --> 04:46:15,738
Perhaps the most dubios piece
of evidence at Nuremberg

3290
04:46:16,163 --> 04:46:17,588
was the story of
"human made into soap".

3291
04:46:21,147 --> 04:46:22,866
Deborah Lipstadt, a cosultant for
the Hoocaust Memorial museum,

3292
04:46:23,281 --> 04:46:25,721
eventually wrote an article confirming
that this was also fabricaion.

3293
04:46:44,220 --> 04:46:45,343
Nazi Soap Rumor During
World War Two

3294
04:46:46,584 --> 04:46:47,896
... The fact is that the Nazis never
used the bodies of Jews,

3295
04:46:48,264 --> 04:46:49,416
or for that matter anyone else,
for the production of soap.

3296
04:46:49,822 --> 04:46:50,999
The soap rumor was prevalent both
during and after the war.

3297
04:46:51,407 --> 04:46:51,910
It may have...

3298
04:46:59,261 --> 04:47:01,407
I rather wished that the Führer
hadn't stood by his followers,

3299
04:47:02,318 --> 04:47:05,925
and taken the responsibility
for his command.

3300
04:47:07,676 --> 04:47:09,123
Think of his position.

3301
04:47:09,870 --> 04:47:13,997
Oh sure. His position as
Chief war criminal, right?

3302
04:47:15,829 --> 04:47:16,915
He was our sovereign.

3303
04:47:19,298 --> 04:47:22,878
It would be intolerable for me to
have him standing before a foreign court.

3304
04:47:25,947 --> 04:47:27,087
You men knew the Führer.

3305
04:47:29,483 --> 04:47:31,034
He would be the first
one to stand up and say,

3306
04:47:32,295 --> 04:47:36,169
"I gave the orders and I
shall take full responsibility!"

3307
04:47:37,427 --> 04:47:40,298
And I would rather
die 10 deaths

3308
04:47:43,325 --> 04:47:46,058
than have the sovereign
subjected to such humiliation.

3309
04:47:55,158 --> 04:47:57,049
GERMAN WAR REPARATION

3310
04:48:04,791 --> 04:48:06,672
Germany finally cleared its
World War One dept in Ocober 2010.

3311
04:48:07,175 --> 04:48:09,091
It amounted to a total of
£22 billion.

3312
04:48:11,028 --> 04:48:12,868
Germany, in 2013, still paying reparation
for World War Two.

3313
04:48:13,323 --> 04:48:15,156
The once-proud nation even has
pending court cases

3314
04:48:15,573 --> 04:48:17,715
at the United Nations for further
reparations concerning Italy and Greece.

3315
04:48:20,519 --> 04:48:21,206
Guilty verdics by the court will
most likely open

3316
04:48:21,615 --> 04:48:23,647
the floodgates for other countries
to follow suit.

3317
04:48:37,486 --> 04:48:39,498
Jews who survived the conceration
camp are known as Holocaust survivors.

3318
04:48:39,998 --> 04:48:41,670
However, other Jews can also
qualify.

3319
04:48:42,157 --> 04:48:44,190
According to AMCHA in Israel,
a Holocaust survivor is any Jew who...

3320
04:48:47,236 --> 04:48:48,443
in 1933... resided anywhere under...

3321
04:48:49,920 --> 04:48:50,904
A Nazi regime

3322
04:48:51,432 --> 04:48:52,848
Nazi occupation

3323
04:48:53,440 --> 04:48:54,894
The regime of Nazi collaborators

3324
04:48:55,849 --> 04:48:57,854
This qualifies any Jew who left
Europe in 1933 for America or elsewhere

3325
04:48:58,296 --> 04:49:00,254
and lived in comfort and safety
whilst the war raget on.

3326
04:49:05,472 --> 04:49:07,437
In 2013, Germany will provide compension
payments to a new category of vicims:

3327
04:49:07,933 --> 04:49:10,102
some 80.000 Jews who fled the German
Army and who eventually resettled

3328
04:49:10,590 --> 04:49:11,918
in former Soviet Union.

3329
04:49:12,539 --> 04:49:14,202
They are eligible for a one-of
payment of $ 3.253

3330
04:49:14,668 --> 04:49:16,754
along whit a monthy Holocaust
pension.

3331
04:49:31,605 --> 04:49:32,875
Despite the seizure by the Allies

3332
04:49:33,267 --> 04:49:34,795
of millions of documents
at the end of the war

3333
04:49:35,284 --> 04:49:36,834
not one single document showing
Adolf Hitler ordered

3334
04:49:37,313 --> 04:49:39,890
systematic exterminatios of the Jews
has ever been found.

3335
04:50:04,888 --> 04:50:06,159
With no photographs, video footage

3336
04:50:06,546 --> 04:50:08,103
or even a single report
of a gassed victim,

3337
04:50:08,644 --> 04:50:10,562
we have had to trust the Soviets
at testimonies of former inmates,

3338
04:50:11,101 --> 04:50:13,059
none of whom were cross-examinated
at Nuremberg.

3339
04:50:16,202 --> 04:50:17,898
However, some inmates tell a
conflicting story

3340
04:50:18,366 --> 04:50:20,596
of their treatment in the Eastern
concentration camps.

3341
04:50:27,043 --> 04:50:33,344
We also had an orchestra where
some of the musicians stands us together

3342
04:50:34,633 --> 04:50:36,555
and one musician was so good

3343
04:50:37,417 --> 04:50:42,190
that he had the instruments
playing and he wrote the notes,

3344
04:50:42,556 --> 04:50:45,316
and later on we had a band
show who played over the weekend.

3345
04:50:47,291 --> 04:50:51,719
And that was of course helping us,
you know we also did plays and stuff.

3346
04:50:52,109 --> 04:50:54,450
Were there any cultural
activities happening in Auschwitz?

3347
04:50:54,961 --> 04:50:59,195
Yes. I told you we
had a piano, put into,

3348
04:50:59,687 --> 04:51:02,955
not just a piano, a grand
piano, was brought into block one.

3349
04:51:03,473 --> 04:51:05,268
Once that was built, that new block,

3350
04:51:05,820 --> 04:51:08,426
the downstairs room was assigned
for theater.

3351
04:51:08,994 --> 04:51:11,878
They said they're going
to build a movie in the camp.

3352
04:51:14,207 --> 04:51:17,120
The prisoners sat down and
, "you must be crazy,

3353
04:51:17,567 --> 04:51:21,180
you cannot make a movie
for us in the camp?"

3354
04:51:21,928 --> 04:51:24,362
But really it happened.
They made a movie in the camp.

3355
04:51:24,880 --> 04:51:29,592
Yeah, and we...
we went in barracks

3356
04:51:30,060 --> 04:51:33,652
after work we... we could
go to see a movie sometimes,

3357
04:51:34,763 --> 04:51:38,233
they brought movies in see.
...in the evenings, and...

3358
04:51:39,296 --> 04:51:41,022
What kind of movies
would they show?

3359
04:51:41,468 --> 04:51:42,611
German movies.

3360
04:51:43,369 --> 04:51:45,198
Once I came to
the main camp,

3361
04:51:45,703 --> 04:51:48,900
we were allowed twice
a month to write home.

3362
04:51:49,466 --> 04:51:51,910
Once a postcard and once a letter.

3363
04:51:53,415 --> 04:51:54,424
They gave you the materials?

3364
04:51:54,833 --> 04:51:58,846
Yeah, they gave us the letter
and the materials... the cost.

3365
04:51:59,128 --> 04:52:00,153
You had money?

3366
04:52:00,495 --> 04:52:04,221
Yeah, we got my ways??...still
got my w??...money we got through the

3367
04:52:04,617 --> 04:52:08,494
Jewish community from
they know who send us...

3368
04:52:09,222 --> 04:52:11,287
everybody some money.

3369
04:52:13,026 --> 04:52:15,742
And in the camp you could
have currency?

3370
04:52:16,126 --> 04:52:18,699
Yeah, we could have money,
because there was in camp loads

3371
04:52:19,044 --> 04:52:20,390
of what they called a "Cantina",

3372
04:52:21,490 --> 04:52:27,782
and not many times, but once in
a while they sold a few cigarettes,

3373
04:52:28,219 --> 04:52:32,460
or they sold something...
whatever they had.

3374
04:52:33,459 --> 04:52:37,079
So if you had money you
could buy, at the Cantina there.

3375
04:52:37,999 --> 04:52:41,853
Redeemable in... in that
Cantina if they had something.

3376
04:52:42,987 --> 04:52:49,413
So, that was their... their
way of distributing money.

3377
04:52:51,270 --> 04:52:54,188
To everybody, everyone got
this money.

3378
04:52:55,091 --> 04:52:58,799
Soccer teams...
were organized very well.

3379
04:52:59,218 --> 04:53:01,860
the event is held in the former
barrack's courtyard

3380
04:53:05,674 --> 04:53:09,222
And one of these uh
enlisted, top enlisted SS men,

3381
04:53:09,897 --> 04:53:12,244
decided he wants to play
for the Polish team.

3382
04:53:13,031 --> 04:53:16,452
So... we say okay,
you can play.

3383
04:53:17,576 --> 04:53:21,543
And then the Commandant...
Commandant... SS Commandant,

3384
04:53:22,414 --> 04:53:24,322
he was uh like...
like a Captain,

3385
04:53:25,474 --> 04:53:28,080
he decided he wanted to
play for the German team.

3386
04:53:28,854 --> 04:53:33,932
So he went in the field. But that's
happened, so... but it was 1944, see?

3387
04:53:34,588 --> 04:53:36,372
Is what you're saying then that um...

3388
04:53:36,754 --> 04:53:38,664
the closer the end
of the war came, uh...

3389
04:53:40,118 --> 04:53:42,492
pressure was let up rather than ah...
- Definitely.

3390
04:53:43,149 --> 04:53:44,811
becoming more cruel or...?

3391
04:53:46,140 --> 04:53:47,249
Freddie Hirsch called me...

3392
04:53:47,831 --> 04:53:50,238
to the children's barracks,
he was heading then,

3393
04:53:50,952 --> 04:53:54,918
and uh... he asked me if I could paint
something on the wall for the children?

3394
04:53:55,294 --> 04:53:57,585
And I said, "well, if you
can get the materials?"

3395
04:53:57,998 --> 04:53:59,128
He said,
"I'll get the materials."

3396
04:53:59,828 --> 04:54:00,699
And I said, "Okay".

3397
04:54:01,194 --> 04:54:03,866
And then a very handsome
young blonde man

3398
04:54:04,198 --> 04:54:06,395
from the man's camp
came over one day,

3399
04:54:07,447 --> 04:54:09,781
and Freddie Hirsch called
me to come and meet him.

3400
04:54:10,597 --> 04:54:12,131
And he asked me what I need?

3401
04:54:12,491 --> 04:54:15,796
So, I said, "well, if I
can get any wall paints,

3402
04:54:16,204 --> 04:54:19,122
so I mean tempera paints,
I would like those,

3403
04:54:19,888 --> 04:54:23,524
if you get me some?"
And he said, "Yes, anything you want."

3404
04:54:25,104 --> 04:54:30,534
So I made a painting of Dopey
standing on another dwarfs head,

3405
04:54:31,069 --> 04:54:33,650
with a cloak around him
so he looked like a tall guy.

3406
04:54:34,601 --> 04:54:36,166
So he would be as tall
as Snow White.

3407
04:54:36,396 --> 04:54:36,852
Theresienstadt Concentration Camp

3408
04:54:36,880 --> 04:54:39,148
I now understand that
there was another painter,

3409
04:54:40,072 --> 04:54:44,059
who continued something
painting on the walls after I'd left.

3410
04:54:44,975 --> 04:54:47,350
What did it do,
not only for... for you,

3411
04:54:47,625 --> 04:54:50,799
but for the...
for the children?

3412
04:54:53,602 --> 04:54:55,524
On, on an emotional level?

3413
04:54:56,051 --> 04:54:59,232
Well it did several things,
not just emotional,

3414
04:54:59,557 --> 04:55:01,581
but the children then wrote a play,

3415
04:55:02,041 --> 04:55:05,348
which was a satire of Snow
White and the Seven Dwarfs.

3416
04:55:05,639 --> 04:55:07,213
The play was very successful.

3417
04:55:07,893 --> 04:55:12,994
Because the little girl,
who was playing Snow White,

3418
04:55:13,043 --> 04:55:14,894
had an incredible voice.

3419
04:55:15,184 --> 04:55:16,317
A gorgeous soprano,

3420
04:55:16,765 --> 04:55:20,098
just like the one that you
hear in the movie.

3421
04:55:23,660 --> 04:55:25,187
Apart from ameniutes we know
of that included...

3422
04:55:26,146 --> 04:55:28,286
An orchesra, movies, camp money,
canteen, postcards, letters,

3423
04:55:28,766 --> 04:55:30,470
theater, musical plays and a
football team...

3424
04:55:31,285 --> 04:55:32,516
Facilities at the Auschwitz "death
camp" also featured...

3425
04:55:35,428 --> 04:55:37,076
A hospial, a library and an
Olimpic size swimming pool

3426
04:55:37,564 --> 04:55:39,173
complete with several diving
boards.

3427
04:55:55,670 --> 04:55:58,365
... AND COMPARED TO STALIN'S GULAGS?

3428
04:56:26,916 --> 04:56:28,547
STALIN'S GULAGS

3429
04:56:37,927 --> 04:56:42,827
Look down, look down,
you'll always be a slave

3430
04:56:43,272 --> 04:56:48,374
Look down, look down,
You're standing in your grave

3431
04:56:48,875 --> 04:56:53,616
Look down, look down,
you'll always be a slave

3432
04:56:54,148 --> 04:56:59,202
Look down, look down,
You're standing in your grave

3433
04:57:20,471 --> 04:57:22,195
To be continued

3434
04:57:29,640 --> 04:57:32,086
Part 21
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

3435
04:57:37,016 --> 04:57:38,553
In1992, a brilliant young Jewish
revisionist named David Cole,

3436
04:57:39,115 --> 04:57:40,532
made a groundbreaking documentary
about the Holocaust.

3437
04:57:41,053 --> 04:57:42,381
This is an edited version of
his work.

3438
04:57:42,805 --> 04:57:44,837
The complete documentary "Cole in
Auschwitz" can be viewed on the internet.

3439
04:57:50,333 --> 04:57:53,474
I know from years of my own
research and the research of others

3440
04:57:54,235 --> 04:57:56,185
that proofs of the Holocaust
are few.

3441
04:57:56,937 --> 04:57:58,612
Literally, all there is

3442
04:57:58,977 --> 04:58:02,592
are the "eyewitness" testimonies
and postwar confessions.

3443
04:58:03,031 --> 04:58:05,790
There's no picture, plan
or wartime document

3444
04:58:06,275 --> 04:58:08,174
dealing with homicidal gas
chambers,

3445
04:58:08,646 --> 04:58:11,040
or a plan to exterminate
the Jews.

3446
04:58:12,664 --> 04:58:16,022
And we can't use the excuse that
the Nazis destroyed all the evidence

3447
04:58:16,468 --> 04:58:18,484
because after we had
broken the German code,

3448
04:58:19,200 --> 04:58:21,965
we were able to intercept
their secret transmissions

3449
04:58:22,260 --> 04:58:24,308
including those that came
from Auschwitz.

3450
04:58:25,027 --> 04:58:27,096
The key to understanding
the Holocaust story

3451
04:58:27,425 --> 04:58:29,520
is understanding the true nature
of the things

3452
04:58:29,950 --> 04:58:31,798
passed off as "proofs".

3453
04:58:32,547 --> 04:58:34,934
Everything that is used as
evidence of the Holocaust

3454
04:58:35,302 --> 04:58:38,590
also can be said to have a
perfectly normal explanation.

3455
04:58:40,505 --> 04:58:41,214
For example,

3456
04:58:41,590 --> 04:58:45,950
these exhibits are said to be
the material "proofs" of exterminations.

3457
04:58:46,564 --> 04:58:50,010
There's the piles of human hair.
But what does that prove?

3458
04:58:50,496 --> 04:58:54,065
It's acknowledged that each inmate
had his or her head shaved

3459
04:58:54,465 --> 04:58:55,966
because of the lice problem.

3460
04:58:56,511 --> 04:58:57,446
That's not denied,

3461
04:58:57,798 --> 04:58:59,829
so why wouldn't there be
piles of human hair?

3462
04:59:00,319 --> 04:59:03,438
What about the piles of shoes
and clothing; is that a proof?

3463
04:59:03,943 --> 04:59:07,196
It's a fact that the prisoners
were issued a uniform upon arrival,

3464
04:59:07,877 --> 04:59:09,124
including shoes.

3465
04:59:09,545 --> 04:59:12,338
So why wouldn't there be piles
of inmates' shoes and clothing?

3466
04:59:12,719 --> 04:59:14,346
It doesn't prove anybody
was killed.

3467
04:59:15,490 --> 04:59:17,427
What about the canisters
of gas?

3468
04:59:17,968 --> 04:59:22,810
No one denies that Zyklon B was used
to disinfect clothes and also buildings.

3469
04:59:23,291 --> 04:59:27,907
Zyklon B was one of the premier pest
control agents in Europe at that time.

3470
04:59:28,474 --> 04:59:31,963
It was present in most of the
concentration camps including those

3471
04:59:32,542 --> 04:59:35,860
that are not said to have had
homicidal gas chambers in them.

3472
04:59:36,308 --> 04:59:39,571
The typhus epidemic that spread
throughout Europe during the war

3473
04:59:40,017 --> 04:59:41,588
and also spread through the camps

3474
04:59:42,053 --> 04:59:44,659
called for stringent lice control
procedures.

3475
04:59:45,813 --> 04:59:47,555
So what other proofs are offered?

3476
04:59:47,962 --> 04:59:50,469
Well, there's the usual
pictures of sick inmates

3477
04:59:50,782 --> 04:59:54,250
which proves the ground-breaking
thesis that people got sick in the camp.

3478
04:59:54,606 --> 04:59:57,162
Once again I'll add that nobody
denies the typhus epidemic

3479
04:59:57,474 --> 04:59:58,874
which resulted in many deaths.

3480
05:00:00,337 --> 05:00:01,206
Then there's the artwork

3481
05:00:02,413 --> 05:00:03,576
and the pictures of children.

3482
05:00:04,190 --> 05:00:07,984
But at this point it's looking pretty bad
for somebody looking for objective proofs

3483
05:00:08,019 --> 05:00:09,190
of the gas chamber.

3484
05:00:09,225 --> 05:00:14,031
And some of the proofs they present
actually work against the concept.

3485
05:00:15,433 --> 05:00:18,613
For example, they have one
of several aerial photographs

3486
05:00:18,989 --> 05:00:22,040
taken at Auschwitz by
the Allies during the war.

3487
05:00:22,270 --> 05:00:24,221
They don't mention, however,
that when blown up,

3488
05:00:24,926 --> 05:00:28,699
these photos don't show people
being gassed or bodies being burned,

3489
05:00:29,312 --> 05:00:32,884
even though they were taken during the
time killings were said to be going on

3490
05:00:33,464 --> 05:00:34,852
almost non-stop.

3491
05:00:35,673 --> 05:00:40,012
Once inside, we can see why revisionists
have had such a field day with this building:

3492
05:00:40,884 --> 05:00:43,260
Obvious marks on the walls
and floors,

3493
05:00:43,677 --> 05:00:45,941
where apparently walls had been
knocked down.

3494
05:00:46,525 --> 05:00:50,195
Equally obvious holes in the floor
where bathroom facilities had been.

3495
05:00:52,218 --> 05:00:53,327
We maintain that,

3496
05:00:53,774 --> 05:00:56,295
unlike the large hollow chamber
we now see,

3497
05:00:56,927 --> 05:01:00,566
this room had once been 5
rooms including a bathroom.

3498
05:01:01,093 --> 05:01:05,270
Yet the building does have what appears
to be evidence of criminal usage;

3499
05:01:05,868 --> 05:01:07,341
4 holes in the ceiling,

3500
05:01:07,845 --> 05:01:11,076
which lead to the roof where
4 little chimneys stand.

3501
05:01:11,668 --> 05:01:15,748
It is said that through these 4 holes,
Zyklon B crystals were dropped.

3502
05:01:16,492 --> 05:01:19,482
And indeed, there seems to be
no other explanation for them.

3503
05:01:20,164 --> 05:01:22,477
Do these holes prove
homicidal gassings?

3504
05:01:23,171 --> 05:01:25,974
Revisionists have claimed in the past
that these holes were added

3505
05:01:26,375 --> 05:01:27,918
after the camp's liberation,

3506
05:01:28,543 --> 05:01:32,293
and that the inside walls were knocked
down and the bathroom facilities removed

3507
05:01:32,597 --> 05:01:35,157
to make the room look
like a big gas chamber.

3508
05:01:36,773 --> 05:01:40,676
Let's start again talking about
this building here. Um this...

3509
05:01:41,804 --> 05:01:43,119
This is a crematorium
/ gas chamber.

3510
05:01:43,445 --> 05:01:44,473
But this is a reconstruction?

3511
05:01:46,208 --> 05:01:49,693
It is in original state.
- Original? -Original state.

3512
05:01:51,006 --> 05:01:52,866
It is an original part. Original.

3513
05:01:53,178 --> 05:01:53,862
Oh, it is original?

3514
05:01:54,206 --> 05:01:57,540
Original, in through this
chimney was thrown Zyklon B.

3515
05:02:00,891 --> 05:02:02,766
Later, a senior official would confirm
that the holes in the roof

3516
05:02:03,197 --> 05:02:04,524
had been built after
the war.

3517
05:02:05,688 --> 05:02:07,373
Are those the original
holes in the ceiling?

3518
05:02:07,627 --> 05:02:08,155
No.

3519
05:02:08,409 --> 05:02:09,397
They've been rebuilt?
- Yes.

3520
05:02:10,763 --> 05:02:12,410
Okay. After the war?
- After the war, yes.

3521
05:02:13,919 --> 05:02:15,770
Dr. Franciszek Piper, the senior curator

3522
05:02:16,185 --> 05:02:18,225
and director or of archives
at the Auschwitz State Museum,

3523
05:02:18,655 --> 05:02:20,767
admitted on camera to David Cole
that "Krema 1", the alleged

3524
05:02:21,191 --> 05:02:23,139
"homocidal gas chamber" at the
Auschwitz main camp was,

3525
05:02:23,555 --> 05:02:25,411
in fact, fabricated after the war
by the Soviet Union,

3526
05:02:25,812 --> 05:02:27,714
under direct orders of Stalin.

3527
05:02:28,179 --> 05:02:30,810
This includes the fake chimney, that
is not even connected with crematorium.

3528
05:02:37,017 --> 05:02:42,907
This is Auschwitz-Birkenau in an Allied
aerial photo from September 1944.

3529
05:02:43,197 --> 05:02:46,310
The train that would come up,
carrying the doomed inmates,

3530
05:02:46,677 --> 05:02:49,647
you would have thousands of
inmates being marched off the trains

3531
05:02:49,971 --> 05:02:54,264
into one of these two gas chambers
in full view of the entire camp.

3532
05:02:54,416 --> 05:02:57,316
This was a spectacle that nobody
in the camp could miss;

3533
05:02:57,647 --> 05:02:59,036
they would see thousands
of people

3534
05:02:59,523 --> 05:03:03,163
marching into those buildings
and nobody coming out.

3535
05:03:03,801 --> 05:03:06,554
These were "gas chambers" that
were not isolated from anyone

3536
05:03:07,129 --> 05:03:10,922
and indeed, when these aerial photo-
graphs were released in the late 70's,

3537
05:03:11,687 --> 05:03:15,479
they contradicted many
supposed eyewitness claims

3538
05:03:15,646 --> 05:03:19,761
about how the Nazis had tried to
camouflage the gas chambers at Birkenau.

3539
05:03:20,853 --> 05:03:22,729
Another question that should
be asked:

3540
05:03:23,449 --> 05:03:27,042
Is there any Zyklon B
residue in the gas chamber,

3541
05:03:27,494 --> 05:03:34,712
knowing that cyanide gas would,
in fact, leave a residue?

3542
05:03:35,303 --> 05:03:38,628
conducted forensic examinations
on the gas chambers at Auschwitz

3543
05:03:39,102 --> 05:03:40,502
to answer that question.

3544
05:03:40,729 --> 05:03:43,469
He took samples from the
4 gas chambers at Birkenau,

3545
05:03:43,852 --> 05:03:44,877
the one at the main camp

3546
05:03:45,485 --> 05:03:46,513
and the control sample

3547
05:03:46,985 --> 05:03:50,551
from one of the disinfestation chambers
that we know did use Zyklon B.

3548
05:03:51,046 --> 05:03:55,150
Now, the gas chamber samples
showed almost no appreciable traces

3549
05:03:55,739 --> 05:04:00,316
whereas the dis-infestation sample
literally went right off the scale.

3550
05:04:01,148 --> 05:04:04,756
In 1990, the Institute of
Forensic Research in Krakow

3551
05:04:05,195 --> 05:04:07,730
decided to conduct
their own forensic tests

3552
05:04:08,113 --> 05:04:10,650
to see if they could refute
Fred Leuchter's findings,

3553
05:04:11,283 --> 05:04:14,107
and their own tests got
back the same results.

3554
05:04:20,796 --> 05:04:21,882
In Canada in 1988, Ernst Zündel
faced charges

3555
05:04:22,265 --> 05:04:23,857
for Holocaust denial in
a second trial.

3556
05:04:24,233 --> 05:04:25,152
He hired American Frederick A.
Leuchter,

3557
05:04:25,536 --> 05:04:26,824
a court-certified expert
in gas execution technology.

3558
05:04:27,153 --> 05:04:28,391
After secrely conducing scientific
experiments

3559
05:04:28,727 --> 05:04:29,879
in camps such as Auschwitz
in Poland,

3560
05:04:30,335 --> 05:04:32,271
on his return he pubished his
findings in the "Leucher Report".

3561
05:04:37,678 --> 05:04:43,159
I told Mr. Zundel and his
defense team prior to my going,

3562
05:04:43,662 --> 05:04:47,830
that if I did in fact find facilities
that could have supported executions,

3563
05:04:48,727 --> 05:04:52,668
not only whether they did,
did support the executions,

3564
05:04:53,182 --> 05:04:56,417
but only whether or not they could
have sustained gas executions,

3565
05:04:56,999 --> 05:04:59,780
I would make that
very clear in my report.

3566
05:05:00,169 --> 05:05:04,199
And that is what I would testify
to, when I testified in court.

3567
05:05:05,476 --> 05:05:07,512
What aside from the samples
convinced you

3568
05:05:07,913 --> 05:05:10,253
that these facilities could not
have been used

3569
05:05:10,508 --> 05:05:12,332
then or now as execution facilities?

3570
05:05:13,566 --> 05:05:17,167
You must have gasketed
doors, no windows.

3571
05:05:17,819 --> 05:05:21,265
Means of getting the gas in,
means of getting the gas out.

3572
05:05:22,612 --> 05:05:26,638
If those persons operating the
facilities didn't gas themselves to death

3573
05:05:27,233 --> 05:05:29,398
at the same time that
the executies died,

3574
05:05:29,845 --> 05:05:32,647
they certainly would have
been blown to bits,

3575
05:05:33,224 --> 05:05:36,974
when the gas exploded from a
switch, the heat of a light bulb,

3576
05:05:37,511 --> 05:05:41,335
or the gas approaching and
getting in to the crematory furnace.

3577
05:05:42,392 --> 05:05:47,862
We're talking about brick and
mortar buildings, without heat,

3578
05:05:49,899 --> 05:05:54,361
with non explosion proof
lighting, without gasketed doors.

3579
05:05:54,786 --> 05:05:56,640
In some cases without doors
at all.

3580
05:05:57,157 --> 05:06:01,625
And with crematories that opened
very close or adjacent to the facility.

3581
05:06:01,946 --> 05:06:05,144
I mean it's just
ludicrous to consider

3582
05:06:05,672 --> 05:06:08,704
that these facilities could have
been used as gas chambers.

3583
05:06:09,148 --> 05:06:11,272
There's no such a thing
as an "eye witness".

3584
05:06:11,942 --> 05:06:14,199
I have never seen a report that
was written,

3585
05:06:14,663 --> 05:06:17,573
by anyone, who had a valid description

3586
05:06:18,202 --> 05:06:21,080
of what could of happened
at a gassing.

3587
05:06:22,508 --> 05:06:26,336
So, the long and the short of it
is, there are no eye witnesses,

3588
05:06:27,821 --> 05:06:29,520
because there were no gassings.

3589
05:06:39,009 --> 05:06:40,863
I think it's necessary to put
this matter

3590
05:06:41,206 --> 05:06:43,126
in its proper historical perspective.

3591
05:06:43,817 --> 05:06:45,765
You see, we live in a time now

3592
05:06:46,171 --> 05:06:48,386
when the old Soviet Union
has fallen apart

3593
05:06:48,934 --> 05:06:51,617
and it's now okay for both liberals
and conservatives,

3594
05:06:51,922 --> 05:06:52,999
as well as everybody else,

3595
05:06:53,464 --> 05:06:55,952
to speak ill of the
departed communist state.

3596
05:06:56,873 --> 05:06:58,514
But it was not always that way.

3597
05:06:59,055 --> 05:07:02,977
During World War 2, the Soviets
were more than just a military ally;

3598
05:07:03,677 --> 05:07:07,803
their anti-Nazi propaganda was
readily accepted by the other Allies

3599
05:07:08,246 --> 05:07:10,339
because it served all of
their purposes.

3600
05:07:10,981 --> 05:07:12,963
The point is, that,
as the victors,

3601
05:07:13,331 --> 05:07:17,643
the Soviets got to commit their
propaganda to the history books as fact.

3602
05:07:19,623 --> 05:07:21,810
With the 20-20 hindsight
we now have,

3603
05:07:22,442 --> 05:07:24,280
the knowledge of Stalin's despotism,

3604
05:07:24,720 --> 05:07:27,852
and the KGB's history of
misinformation and deception,

3605
05:07:28,570 --> 05:07:30,377
as well as the other camps in Poland;

3606
05:07:30,730 --> 05:07:34,041
Majdanek. Belzec, Chelmno, Treblinka
and Sobibor,

3607
05:07:34,659 --> 05:07:38,139
we've had to rely on the Soviets
for most of our information.

3608
05:07:43,410 --> 05:07:46,063
THE RISE AND FALL OF THE
AUSCHWITZ DEATH TOLL

3609
05:07:51,418 --> 05:07:53,854
In Krakov, the trial of the principal
culprits

3610
05:07:54,174 --> 05:07:55,494
for the Auschwitz concentration
camp

3611
05:07:55,989 --> 05:07:58,718
came to an end before a Polish court.
1945- 300.000 dead.

3612
05:07:59,074 --> 05:08:01,650
Altogether nearly 300.000 people
from the most different nations

3613
05:08:02,242 --> 05:08:04,427
died in the Auschwitz concentration
camp.

3614
05:08:10,814 --> 05:08:11,155

AUSCHWITZ - BIRKENAU
1940-1945

3631

Deaths at Auschwitz drop by a
huge 2.5 million,

3632
05:08:29,986 --> 05:08:31,620
but still the total 6.000.000 deaths
remains the same.

THE MEDIA HISTORY OF THE "SIX MILLION"

PIERS MORGAN

05:09:59,652 --> 05:10:00,500
CNN - 2013

3644
05:10:01,256 --> 05:10:02,840
I believe in the inarguable fact,

3645
05:10:03,581 --> 05:10:06,581
that 6 million Jews were killed
in the war by Adolf Hitler Nazis.

3646
05:10:07,100 --> 05:10:08,452
I'm merely asking you,

3647
05:10:08,787 --> 05:10:10,956
as a President of Iran,
and as a scholar,

3648
05:10:11,757 --> 05:10:14,908
do you believe 6 million Jews
were killed by the Nazis,

3649
05:10:15,202 --> 05:10:16,441
or do you think that is
not true?

3650
05:10:17,070 --> 05:10:18,356
In a 2005 speech, Iran's former
president, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad,

3651
05:10:18,853 --> 05:10:20,117
caused an international uproar
by describing the Holocaust

3652
05:10:20,486 --> 05:10:22,104
as a fabricated legend
promoted to protect Israel.

3653
05:10:31,946 --> 05:10:33,481
David Cole disappires after his 1994
appearance on the Phil Donahue show

3654
05:10:33,801 --> 05:10:35,066
after receiving several death threats
from Jewish extremists.

3655
05:10:35,801 --> 05:10:36,802
He recently emerged from hiding
in 2013.

3656
05:10:37,685 --> 05:10:39,109
In Canada in 1988, Ernst Zündel was
convicted

3657
05:10:39,533 --> 05:10:40,718
and sentenced to a nine-month
jail term

3658
05:10:41,158 --> 05:10:42,510
after the court dismissed Leucher's
testimony.

3659
05:10:43,386 --> 05:10:45,410
Later, Ernst Zündel will spent 2 years
in solitary confinement in a Canadian jail

3660
05:10:45,849 --> 05:10:47,305
before being deported to Germany
to stand trial.

3661
05:10:53,105 --> 05:10:54,826
Fred Leuchter asked for a joint
scientific investigation into the Holocust.

3662
05:10:55,194 --> 05:10:55,880
It never happened.

3663
05:10:56,206 --> 05:10:57,773
Insteed he was targeted by Jewish
extremists and his career ruined.

3664
05:10:58,730 --> 05:10:59,880
Since its publication the Leuchter
Report has earned

3665
05:11:00,273 --> 05:11:01,640
legendary status in the world
of Hoocaust Revisionism.

3666
05:11:04,167 --> 05:11:05,366
Denying the Holocaust is a
criminal offence

3667
05:11:05,734 --> 05:11:06,942
and carries a custodial sentence
in several European counries.

3668
05:11:07,684 --> 05:11:09,201
The Holocaust is the ONLY event
in history to be enforced by law.

Jews were gassed.

3691
05:12:16,982 --> 05:12:19,154
Now be... be careful,
I beg of you.

3692
05:12:19,918 --> 05:12:21,601
This is against the law in Germany.

3693
05:12:22,421 --> 05:12:24,700
If there was a German, or
somebody with the German state,

3694
05:12:25,209 --> 05:12:27,212
you could have me thrown in
prison, before I leave Germany.

THE OCEAN OF DEATH

3703

After delivering the first atomic bomb
for the drop over Hiroshima,

3704
05:13:26,421 --> 05:13:27,622
the USS Indianapolis is hit by
two torpedoes

fired from a Japanese submarine.

3706
05:13:30,022 --> 05:13:31,605
The ship with a crew of 1197
sank in only 12 minues.

3707
05:13:32,126 --> 05:13:33,926
It is estimated that 300 sailors
initially perished.

3708
05:13:44,055 --> 05:13:45,725

DAY TWO

3711
05:15:06,682 --> 05:15:08,185
DAY 3

3712
05:15:11,906 --> 05:15:13,353
The terrified sailors are cold,
hungry and thirsty.

3713
05:15:13,733 --> 05:15:15,085
Many are unable to resist
drinking sea water,

3714
05:15:15,467 --> 05:15:16,771
which will not only cause them
to vomit and hallucinate,

3715
05:15:17,114 --> 05:15:18,683
but will eventually be fatal
in less then six hours

3716
05:15:29,484 --> 05:15:30,522
The USS Indianapolis is now
long overdue

3717
05:15:30,929 --> 05:15:32,604
and US officials are still unaware
of the plight of the crew.

3718
05:15:33,059 --> 05:15:35,077
The tragedy will be the largest
maritime disaster in US naval history.

3719
05:15:47,748 --> 05:15:49,315
DAY FOUR

3720
05:15:58,112 --> 05:15:59,735
Out of the almost 900 that survived
the initial torpedo attack

3721
05:16:00,065 --> 05:16:01,295
only 317 are rescued from the
shark-infested waters.

3722
05:16:01,814 --> 05:16:03,336
Captain Charles B. McVay survived
the disaster,

3723
05:16:03,752 --> 05:16:05,168
but was later court-martialed
and find guilty

3724
05:16:05,585 --> 05:16:07,781
of endangering the ship in a
government cover-up in November 1945.

3725
05:16:08,597 --> 05:16:09,804
After years of being plagued by
abusive phone calls

3726
05:16:10,150 --> 05:16:12,397
from family members of the crow,
he commited suicide in 1968.

3727
05:16:13,782 --> 05:16:14,898
He was exoerated of all charges

3728
05:16:15,378 --> 05:16:17,158
by the United States Congress
in October 2000.

3729
05:16:28,941 --> 05:16:31,683
Six days after the bombing of Nagasaki,
hostilities between the US and Japan cease.

3730
05:16:32,209 --> 05:16:33,873
World War Two finaly ends.

3731
05:16:39,042 --> 05:16:40,373
From the Mediterranean to the Baltic,

3732
05:16:40,869 --> 05:16:43,178
the victors were shaping Europe
in their own image.

3733
05:16:45,022 --> 05:16:48,820
Poland, the invader's route
to Russia, obsessed Stalin.

3734
05:16:50,787 --> 05:16:53,239
Eastern Poland had been
annexed by the Soviet Union.

3735
05:16:54,469 --> 05:16:57,639
As compensation the Allies
shifted the whole country westward,

3736
05:16:58,281 --> 05:17:00,293
giving Poland the eastern
territories of Germany.

3737
05:17:01,708 --> 05:17:03,863
The Germans were expelled.

3738
05:17:05,888 --> 05:17:07,184
Soviet zone

3739
05:17:09,349 --> 05:17:11,655
From all over Europe
some 12 million Germans

3740
05:17:12,108 --> 05:17:15,144
were expelled from lands
they had lived in for centuries.

3741
05:17:20,855 --> 05:17:22,977
Today it's called ethnic cleansing.

3742
05:17:23,348 --> 05:17:25,963
Then, the Allies called
it population transfer.

3743
05:17:26,786 --> 05:17:28,885
And the British helped to
move the Germans out.

3744
05:17:32,549 --> 05:17:33,787
The Allies will now strip
factories of machinery

3745
05:17:34,207 --> 05:17:35,215
and plunder German inventions

3746
05:17:35,604 --> 05:17:37,079
50 years or more ahead
of their time.

3747
05:17:37,809 --> 05:17:39,162
In just 12 jears under Adolf Hitler
and National Socialism,

3748
05:17:39,543 --> 05:17:40,911
Germany had become the world
leader in the fields

3749
05:17:41,351 --> 05:17:42,432
of medicine, science and techology.

3750
05:17:43,661 --> 05:17:44,989
It is the greatest theft of nation's
intellect ever,

3751
05:17:45,581 --> 05:17:47,141
with 1554 tons of patented documents
worth billions,

3752
05:17:47,575 --> 05:17:49,446
collected and sent back
to the US alone.

3753
05:17:56,393 --> 05:18:00,332
The Allies had decided that Germany
should compensate them for war damage.

3754
05:18:05,176 --> 05:18:09,492
The German population was forced to help
the Russians seize industrial resources.

3755
05:18:11,733 --> 05:18:12,701
Not just machines,

3756
05:18:13,280 --> 05:18:16,778
thousands of craftsmen and scientists
were kidnapped

3757
05:18:16,878 --> 05:18:18,112
and taken to the Soviet Union.

3758
05:18:23,377 --> 05:18:24,256
THE WONDER OF GERMAN SCIENCE
AND TECHNOLOGY

3759
05:18:24,565 --> 05:18:26,504
This part of the story
is an amazing one.

3760
05:18:26,767 --> 05:18:29,309
And few people even
today know about it.

3761
05:18:29,493 --> 05:18:31,211
Werner von Braun - Leading
German rocket scientist

3762
05:18:40,586 --> 05:18:41,913
Watch it Chuck,
keep your eyes open.

3763
05:18:42,299 --> 05:18:43,553
There's a break at 11, break at 11.

3764
05:18:44,157 --> 05:18:45,569
Planes 9 o'clock coming around.

3765
05:18:55,746 --> 05:18:57,049
Fire at 10:30.
Coming around.

3766
05:18:57,609 --> 05:18:58,862
10:30 upper or lower?

3767
05:19:02,044 --> 05:19:03,802
B-17 out of control at 3 o'clock.

3768
05:19:04,577 --> 05:19:06,496
Come on you guys, get
out of that plane. Bail out.

3769
05:19:07,080 --> 05:19:08,518
There's one, he come out
of the bomb bay.

3770
05:19:10,469 --> 05:19:11,452
What was that?
What the hell was that?

3771
05:19:13,178 --> 05:19:14,544
It went by like we
were standing still.

3772
05:19:16,206 --> 05:19:17,652
Blue leader to grouping.
Get on the air.

3773
05:19:19,596 --> 05:19:21,561
Going by at 2 o'clock.
What the hell is it?

3774
05:19:23,666 --> 05:19:28,506
It was the Messerschmidt 262, the
world's first operational jet fighter.

3775
05:19:29,326 --> 05:19:33,125
It flies a 150 miles an hour
faster than our fastest fighter.

3776
05:19:37,044 --> 05:19:39,783
On becoming airborne, the
undercarriage was jettisoned,

3777
05:19:40,189 --> 05:19:42,822
and the aircraft demonstrated
an amazing rate of climb.

3778
05:19:54,534 --> 05:19:56,767
Later, Dittmar was towed to altitude

3779
05:19:57,149 --> 05:20:01,132
to conserve fuel when he achieved
623 miles per hour,

3780
05:20:01,677 --> 05:20:03,958
easily breaking the
existing world speed record.

3781
05:20:04,819 --> 05:20:07,451
Hanna Reitsch also test
flew one of the early models,

3782
05:20:08,001 --> 05:20:09,712
from the Messerschmidt
airfield in Lechfeld.

3783
05:20:10,336 --> 05:20:12,088
And she later flew a
more powerful version,

3784
05:20:12,560 --> 05:20:15,498
now named Komet, which
made a great impression on her.

3785
05:20:16,325 --> 05:20:17,378
"And I can only tell you,

3786
05:20:17,657 --> 05:20:20,535
it was like thundering
through the skies

3787
05:20:20,895 --> 05:20:22,567
sitting on a cannonball."

3788
05:21:41,967 --> 05:21:44,217
OPERATION PAPERCLIP
The US hunt for Hirler's scientists

3789
05:21:51,154 --> 05:21:55,247
By mid-June 1945,
1000 ex-Nazi scientists

3790
05:21:55,872 --> 05:21:57,384
from various German weapons
programs

3791
05:21:57,599 --> 05:22:00,912
had been hastily moved to the
safety of the American zone.

3792
05:22:04,452 --> 05:22:07,424
There they could be kept away from
anyone who might prosecute them.

3793
05:22:14,030 --> 05:22:16,847
Russia's leader Joseph Stalin
was outraged.

3794
05:22:17,693 --> 05:22:21,155
"We defeated the Nazis.
We occupied Berlin and Peenemunde.

3795
05:22:21,897 --> 05:22:24,061
But the Americans got
the rocket engineers.

3796
05:22:24,425 --> 05:22:25,574
How could this happen?"

3797
05:22:27,700 --> 05:22:31,113
What's more, over a 100 V-2's
were making their way to America

3798
05:22:31,627 --> 05:22:33,267
under Special Mission V-2.

3799
05:22:34,028 --> 05:22:36,129
The Americans had stolen
the V-2 team

3800
05:22:36,458 --> 05:22:40,039
and much of its equipment
from under the Russians' noses.

3801
05:22:46,933 --> 05:22:48,846
TO THE VICTOR THE SPOILS...

3802
05:22:53,367 --> 05:22:55,705
... AND WITH DEFEAT RETRIBUTION

3803
05:22:59,653 --> 05:23:00,496
Even though the war has ended,

3804
05:23:01,030 --> 05:23:02,582
most of Europe is still a violent
and dangerous place.

3805
05:23:03,069 --> 05:23:04,796
Many will seek revenge on Axis
soldiers, ethnic Germans

3806
05:23:05,250 --> 05:23:06,910
and especially any known
"Nazi" collaborators.

3807
05:23:11,854 --> 05:23:14,243
Central Europe was
reverting to the Dark Ages.

3808
05:23:14,637 --> 05:23:15,531
FRANCE

3809
05:23:16,503 --> 05:23:19,887
This was a space without
law, shelter or mercy.

3810
05:24:21,785 --> 05:24:22,847
CZECHOSLOVAKIA

3811
05:24:42,910 --> 05:24:44,389
In Czechoslovakia German soldiers
are beaten to death

3812
05:24:44,775 --> 05:24:47,065
and their bodies spat on

3813
05:25:14,969 --> 05:25:16,665
To be contiued

3814
05:25:18,992 --> 05:25:21,486
Part 23
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

3815
05:25:29,391 --> 05:25:31,114
Of the Soviet's 7 million World War
Two captives,

3816
05:25:31,619 --> 05:25:32,992
more than half were German.

3817
05:25:33,860 --> 05:25:35,283
In 1953, an article in The Pittsburg
Press admitted

3818
05:25:35,764 --> 05:25:37,349
2.8 million German POWs capures by
the Soviet Union had died,

3819
05:25:37,829 --> 05:25:39,524
and that another 700.000
were in slavery.

3820
05:25:41,213 --> 05:25:42,644
Only around 20.000 German POWs
held in the Soviet Union

3821
05:25:43,092 --> 05:25:44,435
would be repariated to Germany.

3822
05:25:44,971 --> 05:25:46,651
The last survivors were not
relesed until 1955.

3823
05:25:48,984 --> 05:25:50,431
Thus, an esimated 3.480.000
German POWs

3824
05:25:50,928 --> 05:25:52,848
perished whilst in Soviet
captivity.

3825
05:26:05,687 --> 05:26:08,549
11/4 Million German POWs
Vanish in Russia

1955 WOCHENSHAU, GERMANY

3827
05:26:24,727 --> 05:26:25,879
Wochenschau
Oktobar 1955

3828
05:26:44,788 --> 05:26:45,653
Heinz Krüger

3829
05:28:32,273 --> 05:28:34,065
Their war was over, but POWs
return to an occupied,

3830
05:28:34,478 --> 05:28:35,962
divided and de-Nazified Germany.

3831
05:28:36,877 --> 05:28:38,753
The Allies had learned their lesson
well after World War One.

3832
05:28:39,185 --> 05:28:40,969
The NSDAP, along with its official
insignia the Swastika,

3833
05:28:41,370 --> 05:28:42,759
had be banned.

3834
05:28:43,524 --> 05:28:44,571
School teachers would be replaced,

3835
05:28:44,645 --> 05:28:46,434
and National Socialist books and
documents burned or taken away.

3836
05:28:46,866 --> 05:28:48,778
Meanwhile, the war trials had served
their intended purpose

3837
05:28:49,190 --> 05:28:50,889
of demonising the NS leadership
and dehumanising the German people.

3838
05:28:51,832 --> 05:28:53,146
This time there was to be
no peace treaty.

3839
05:28:53,555 --> 05:28:55,843
Germany would instead remain occupied,
with the history of World War Two

3840
05:28:55,930 --> 05:28:57,445
to be dictated by the victorious Alien.

3841
05:29:01,457 --> 05:29:03,092
Former Natioal Socialists will be
portrayed as "Evil Nazis"

3842
05:29:03,514 --> 05:29:04,673
with the help of the media,

3843
05:29:05,241 --> 05:29:07,063
future television documentaries
and Hollywood movies.

3844
05:29:09,519 --> 05:29:11,343
In Germany, Adolf Hitler's name is
not to be spoken of.

3845
05:29:11,718 --> 05:29:13,608
I will be instead replaced by those
who still secretly admire the Führer

3846
05:29:14,000 --> 05:29:15,432
with the ironic code word "USA".

3847
05:29:15,870 --> 05:29:17,407
Unser Seeliger Adolf

3848
05:29:18,390 --> 05:29:19,830
This was confirmed by Winifred
Wagner, daugher-in-law

3849
05:29:20,301 --> 05:29:21,973
of German composer Richard Wagner.

3850
05:29:35,612 --> 05:29:38,053
"We old national socialists found
a new pseudonym after the war

3851
05:29:38,354 --> 05:29:39,906
because you couldn't talk about
him in public...

3852
05:29:43,494 --> 05:29:46,430
... if you wanted to talk about him,
we called him USA.

3853
05:29:47,120 --> 05:29:49,530
In German this stands
for "Our Blessed Adolf".

3854
05:31:18,295 --> 05:31:19,845
On 8 May 1945, the High Command of
the German Armed forces,

3855
05:31:20,339 --> 05:31:22,012
General Alfred Jodl, signed a
Deed of Surrender.

3856
05:31:22,513 --> 05:31:23,650
It was not however signed by

3857
05:31:24,094 --> 05:31:26,070
the appointed head of the
Third Reich, Admiral Karl Dönitz.

3858
05:31:27,900 --> 05:31:29,387
Therefore legally, Germany,
as a country

3859
05:31:29,866 --> 05:31:31,619
did not surrender after
World War Two.

3860
05:31:34,986 --> 05:31:36,726
This means that the Federal Republic
of Germany, installed by the Soviets,

3861
05:31:37,231 --> 05:31:39,159
as well as the Democratic Republic
of Germany as estabished by West,

3862
05:31:39,587 --> 05:31:41,200
were both illegal under
international law,

3863
05:31:41,647 --> 05:31:43,543
as each had been constructed
over an existing sovereign State.

3864
05:31:47,009 --> 05:31:48,789
In 1961 after years of tension
between the Soviet Union and West,

3865
05:31:49,307 --> 05:31:51,053
Soviet-controlled Eastern Europe
will close its border,

3866
05:31:51,535 --> 05:31:53,296
inflicting more misery on
the people of Berlin.

3867
05:32:12,728 --> 05:32:14,552
1961 BERLIN

3868
05:32:20,841 --> 05:32:22,680
Freedom to travel to the West
for millions now living

3869
05:32:23,188 --> 05:32:24,889
under Commuist occupation is
forbidden.

3870
05:32:25,538 --> 05:32:27,314
These restrictions and others
become known as the

3871
05:32:27,921 --> 05:32:29,364
"Iron Curtain".

3872
05:32:32,131 --> 05:32:35,020
The pupppet government of East Germany
will build the Berlin Wall,

3873
05:32:35,160 --> 05:32:37,724
subsequently cutting off 19 million
Germans from family and friends.

3874
05:32:43,824 --> 05:32:46,790
Many risk their lives in a desperate
bid to reach West Berlin.

3875
05:35:05,403 --> 05:35:06,881
In 1989, as Communism is collapsing
in Soviet Union,

3876
05:35:07,303 --> 05:35:08,917
many in Eastern Europe will seek
refuge in Western embassies.

3877
05:35:09,764 --> 05:35:11,063
After 28 years of divison,
presure now mount

3878
05:35:11,477 --> 05:35:13,310
on East German authorities
to open their border.

3879
05:35:23,071 --> 05:35:24,284
Astonishing news from East Germany,

3880
05:35:24,706 --> 05:35:26,346
where the East German authorities
have said

3881
05:35:26,446 --> 05:35:28,870
in essence that the Berlin Wall
doesn't mean anything anymore.

3882
05:35:28,989 --> 05:35:29,437
9 NOVEMBER 1989

3883
05:35:29,468 --> 05:35:33,080
The wall that the East Germans
put up in 1961 to keep its people in

3884
05:35:33,519 --> 05:35:35,966
will now be breached by
anybody who wants to leave.

3885
05:35:36,827 --> 05:35:39,186
It is perhaps the most
important announcement made in

3886
05:35:39,679 --> 05:35:42,191
Central Europe since the end
of World War 2 certainly...

3887
05:36:05,618 --> 05:36:08,161
THE GREAT ALLIED
"EAST GERMAN" DECEPTION

3888
05:36:15,696 --> 05:36:17,941
Most outside Germany believe that
the country is once again whole,

3889
05:36:18,366 --> 05:36:19,721
when in fact it was only central
Germany

3890
05:36:20,187 --> 05:36:21,457
that was reunified on
3 Oct 1990.

3891
05:36:22,209 --> 05:36:23,097
The Eastern territories,

3892
05:36:23,567 --> 05:36:25,192
as defined by the Allies at the
Postdam Conference in 1945

3893
05:36:25,679 --> 05:36:27,507
still remain under Polish and
Russian control.

3894
05:36:41,735 --> 05:36:43,622
On 23 May 1949, the Western Allies
ratified a new German constitution

3895
05:36:44,118 --> 05:36:46,015
known as the Basic Law

3896
05:36:49,337 --> 05:36:51,044
However, two days prior,
a secret state treaty

3897
05:36:53,042 --> 05:36:54,216
was also signed.

3898
05:36:54,759 --> 05:36:57,233
It granted complete Allied control
over education and all licensed media

3899
05:36:59,562 --> 05:37:01,112
until the year 2099.

3900
05:37:01,807 --> 05:37:03,415
This was cofirmed by Major-General
Gerd-Helmut Komossa,

3901
05:37:03,871 --> 05:37:05,447
former head of German Millitary
Intelligence in his book

3902
05:37:05,926 --> 05:37:07,743
"Die Deutsche Karte"

3903
05:37:27,583 --> 05:37:29,282
On 19 September 2000, a limited
liability company was formed

3904
05:37:29,680 --> 05:37:31,610
to organise the financial affairs
for the Federal Republic of Germany.

3905
05:37:32,042 --> 05:37:33,058
It was called the:

3906
05:37:33,521 --> 05:37:35,379
"Bundesrepublik Deutschland
Finanzagentur GmbH"

3907
05:37:37,916 --> 05:37:39,380
The German GmbH is an economic
branch of the huge Jewish

3908
05:37:39,836 --> 05:37:41,404
financial conglomerates that incude

3909
05:37:41,870 --> 05:37:44,204
Rothschild, Goldman Sachs
and Federal Reserve.

3910
05:37:44,734 --> 05:37:46,077
These forces of Inernational Jewry
are the very same

3911
05:37:46,542 --> 05:37:48,243
about Adolf Hitler tried to
forewarn the German people.

3912
05:37:50,728 --> 05:37:52,074
All of Germany's gold reserves are
now held

3913
05:37:52,721 --> 05:37:54,545
in the US Federal Reserve Bank
of New York.

3914
05:37:56,802 --> 05:37:58,794
Now as then, the German people find
themselves in the same state of

3915
05:37:59,290 --> 05:38:02,748
economic servitude the Führer
sought to correct.

3916
05:38:29,544 --> 05:38:33,017
THE DECEPTION CONTINUES

3917
05:38:39,700 --> 05:38:41,777
On the 70th anniversary of the
invasion of Poland in 2009,

3918
05:38:42,326 --> 05:38:44,165
German Chancellor Angela Merkel
apologised

3919
05:38:44,529 --> 05:38:46,660
and publicly blamed Germany
alone for starting World War Two.

3920
05:38:49,228 --> 05:38:50,377
"Seventy years ago today,

3921
05:38:53,056 --> 05:38:54,593
with Germany's attack on Poland,

3922
05:38:54,987 --> 05:38:59,080
began the most tragic chapter
in the history of Europe.

3923
05:39:00,808 --> 05:39:02,566
This war instigated by Germany

3924
05:39:03,374 --> 05:39:05,797
brought immeasurable suffering
on many peoples,

3925
05:39:06,603 --> 05:39:10,836
years of disenfranchisement,
humiliation, and destruction.

3926
05:39:12,093 --> 05:39:15,969
I commemorate the many millions of
people who lost their lives in that war,

3927
05:39:16,463 --> 05:39:17,974
and in resistance to Germany.

3928
05:39:18,872 --> 05:39:20,419
I commemorate those 60 million

3929
05:39:20,931 --> 05:39:24,553
who died in this war,
instigated by Germany."

3930
05:39:29,129 --> 05:39:32,361
Was she speaking as the
Chancellor of Germany?

3931
05:39:39,109 --> 05:39:41,987
Or on behalf of a private
non-government Zionist organisation?

3932
05:39:54,935 --> 05:39:56,827
Germany today is still an occupied
country, with 100.000 foreign troops

3933
05:39:57,131 --> 05:39:58,267
stationed on her soil.

3934
05:39:58,555 --> 05:40:00,235
After 68 years there still has
been no peace treaty

3935
05:40:00,676 --> 05:40:02,251
concluded with any of the
Allied powers.

3936
05:40:08,547 --> 05:40:10,008
Boundary of training area
of the US forces

3937
05:40:10,388 --> 05:40:11,827
WARNING

05:40:12,057 --> 05:40:13,350

05:40:19,809 --> 05:40:22,252
To be continued

Part 24
Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

3942
05:40:33,308 --> 05:40:34,580
CENTRAL BANK
So, what is a central bank?

3943
05:40:35,898 --> 05:40:37,281
A central bank is an institution 

3944
05:40:37,567 --> 05:40:39,448
that produces the currency
of an entire nation.

3945
05:40:40,382 --> 05:40:41,746
Based on historical precedent,

3946
05:40:42,114 --> 05:40:45,436
two specific powers are inherent
in central banking practice.

3947
05:40:45,966 --> 05:40:47,488
The control of interest rates,

3948
05:40:47,488 --> 05:40:48,086
INTEREST RATES
INFLATION (MONEY SUPPLY)

3949
05:40:48,121 --> 05:40:50,163
and the control of the money
supply or inflation.

3950
05:40:51,524 --> 05:40:54,500
The central bank does not simply supply
a government's economy with money,

3951
05:40:54,914 --> 05:40:56,927
it loans it to them at interest!

3952
05:40:58,350 --> 05:41:01,152
Then through the use of increasing
and decreasing the supply of money,

3953
05:41:01,684 --> 05:41:05,427
the central bank regulates the
value of the currency being issued.

3954
05:41:06,763 --> 05:41:09,067
It is critical to understand
the entire structure

3955
05:41:09,626 --> 05:41:14,913
of this system can only produce
one thing in the long run: debt.

3956
05:41:15,355 --> 05:41:15,986
DEBT!

3957
05:41:16,065 --> 05:41:18,828
It doesn't take a lot of
ingenuity to figure this scam out.

3958
05:41:19,138 --> 05:41:23,779
For every single dollar produced by
the central bank is loaned at interest.

3959
05:41:24,311 --> 05:41:27,619
That means every single dollar
produced is actually the dollar plus

3960
05:41:28,081 --> 05:41:31,211
a certain percent of
debt based on that dollar.

3961
05:41:31,708 --> 05:41:33,681
And since the central
bank has a monopoly

3962
05:41:34,201 --> 05:41:36,472
of the production of the
currency for the entire country,

3963
05:41:37,296 --> 05:41:41,228
and they loan each dollar out
with immediate debt attached to it,

3964
05:41:42,291 --> 05:41:44,321
where does the money to
pay for the debt come from?

3965
05:41:45,777 --> 05:41:47,351
It can only come from
the central bank again.

3966
05:41:48,155 --> 05:41:51,944
Which means the central bank has to
perpetually increase its money supply

3967
05:41:52,507 --> 05:41:56,062
to temporarily cover the outstanding
debt created, which in turn,

3968
05:41:56,507 --> 05:41:59,166
since that new money is loaned out
at interest as well, 

3969
05:41:59,639 --> 05:42:01,688
creates even more debt.
MORE DEBT

3970
05:42:01,612 --> 05:42:03,128
The end result of this
system without fail, 

3971
05:42:03,577 --> 05:42:04,437
is slavery.
DEBT = SLAVERY

3972
05:42:04,781 --> 05:42:07,230
For it is impossible for the
government, and thus the public,

3973
05:42:07,901 --> 05:42:10,374
to ever come out of the
self-generating debt.

3974
05:42:11,229 --> 05:42:14,168
Now, the control of the economy
and the perpetual robbery of wealth

3975
05:42:14,708 --> 05:42:18,196
is only one side of the Rubik's
cube the bankers hold in their hands.

3976
05:42:18,620 --> 05:42:21,280
The next tool for profit
and control is war.

3977
05:42:21,630 --> 05:42:22,311
WAR!

3978
05:42:22,966 --> 05:42:25,306
It's important to understand
that the most lucrative thing

3979
05:42:25,640 --> 05:42:28,077
that could happen with
international bankers is war,

3980
05:42:28,451 --> 05:42:30,727
for it forces the country to
borrow even more money

3981
05:42:31,147 --> 05:42:34,699
from the Federal Reserve Bank
at interest... at interest... at interest...

3982
05:42:40,657 --> 05:42:44,705
HITLER'S ECONOMIC MIRACLE
The real reason for World War Two?

3983
05:42:49,374 --> 05:42:50,261
"Germany is too strong.

3984
05:42:50,702 --> 05:42:52,736
We must destroy her."
- Winston Churchill Nov 1936

3985
05:43:00,404 --> 05:43:02,292
When Hitler came to power,
Germany was hopelessly bankrupt.

3986
05:43:02,845 --> 05:43:05,083
For years, the Allies had demanded
crushing reparation payments,

3987
05:43:05,593 --> 05:43:07,791
and private currecy speculators
would now cause

3988
05:43:08,256 --> 05:43:09,584
the German Mark to plummet.

3989
05:43:10,107 --> 05:43:11,301
It was a total destruction of
national curency

3990
05:43:11,780 --> 05:43:12,875
and wiped out savings and
businesses,

3991
05:43:13,361 --> 05:43:15,185
leaving ordinary Germans
to starve.

3992
05:43:17,560 --> 05:43:18,765
Hitler devised a national credit
program

3993
05:43:19,356 --> 05:43:20,782
which included the construction
of new roads,

3994
05:43:21,309 --> 05:43:22,779
bridges, canals and port facilities.

3995
05:43:24,193 --> 05:43:26,653
Jews at this point were removed
from prominent financial positions

3996
05:43:27,110 --> 05:43:28,863
and instead of borrowing from
the banks at interest,

3997
05:43:29,391 --> 05:43:31,502
the government issued bills of
exchange called...

3998
05:43:32,063 --> 05:43:33,549
Labour Treasury Certificates.

3999
05:43:36,990 --> 05:43:38,793
This issuance of currency was backed
by the productivity

4000
05:43:39,242 --> 05:43:40,881
and economic of Germany's
labour force,

4001
05:43:41,306 --> 05:43:43,353
and it came on the authority -
not of some privately-owned central bank-

4002
05:43:43,793 --> 05:43:45,970
but that of the National Socialist
government itself.

4003
05:43:48,144 --> 05:43:49,677
Germany even succeeded in exporting
goods

4004
05:43:50,093 --> 05:43:51,885
abroad despite the 1933 international
Jewish boycott,

4005
05:43:52,349 --> 05:43:55,650
using a barter system that again
cut out the banks competely.

4006
05:44:14,571 --> 05:44:16,622
As a result, Germany - despite
the worldwide depression - became

4007
05:44:17,044 --> 05:44:19,160
the most powerful and prosperous
state in Europe in only 5 years.

4008
05:44:23,578 --> 05:44:26,240
According to the 1978 book
"Which Way Western Man?"

4009
05:44:26,822 --> 05:44:28,412
by
William Gayey Simpson

4010
05:44:31,291 --> 05:44:33,079
"The German peasant, who had been
on the verge of utter ruin,

4011
05:44:33,579 --> 05:44:36,226
was given an honored status as the
source of the nation's food supply,

4012
05:44:36,730 --> 05:44:38,936
his land was released from the
grip of the Jewish usurer and measures

4013
05:44:39,419 --> 05:44:42,138
taken to ensure that it should,

4014
05:44:42,139 --> 05:44:43,139
remain permanently in the possession
of one family,

4015
05:44:43,239 --> 05:44:44,323
handed down from father to son."

4016
05:44:45,194 --> 05:44:47,249
The Jews could not let continue
as they knew it would spell the death

4017
05:44:47,750 --> 05:44:49,748
of their dept-driven monetary system.

4018
05:44:50,236 --> 05:44:52,485
World War Tho starts in earnest
that year.

4019
05:44:53,712 --> 05:44:55,928
It was not war between Germany
and the Allies,

4020
05:44:56,351 --> 05:44:58,502
it was a war between Germany
and Jewish powers

4021
05:44:58,909 --> 05:45:00,743
who controled the Allied governmens
and their media,

4022
05:45:01,254 --> 05:45:02,820
using both to propagandize the
Allied populace

4023
05:45:03,324 --> 05:45:05,662
into fearing and hating
German people.

4024
05:45:08,825 --> 05:45:10,831
In the end, it took the entire Capitalist
and Communist world

4025
05:45:11,277 --> 05:45:13,533
to destroy the German revolution,
and bring Europe back

4026
05:45:14,086 --> 05:45:16,990
under the heel of the bankers,
where it remains to this day.

4027
05:45:33,686 --> 05:45:35,377
"If Hitler had not come
to Germany in 1933?

4028
05:45:37,432 --> 05:45:41,239
Germany had 270.000
suicides the year before.

4029
05:45:41,830 --> 05:45:42,809
Germany was, in Berlin,

4030
05:45:43,459 --> 05:45:46,958
the sin capital of the world,
thanks to largely Jewish entrepreneurs,

4031
05:45:47,381 --> 05:45:51,702
who ran the smut films
and the cabarets and so on.

4032
05:45:52,049 --> 05:45:54,414
Germany was
dope capital for Europe.

4033
05:45:54,895 --> 05:45:57,055
German industry was virtually dead.

4034
05:45:58,072 --> 05:46:00,171
Without Adolf Hitler, Germany would
have

4035
05:46:00,731 --> 05:46:04,230
died with a whimper in 1934
or 1935.

4036
05:46:04,543 --> 05:46:07,095
Adolf Hitler saved Germany.

4037
05:46:07,623 --> 05:46:12,688
At least he gave the Germans 12
years of liberation and freedom...

4038
05:46:13,149 --> 05:46:17,931
liberation and freedom... liberation
and freedom... liberation and freedom..."

4039
05:46:32,298 --> 05:46:33,458
MEDIA VENGEANCE

4040
05:46:33,881 --> 05:46:35,794
With the Hollywood movie industry
and majority of US television networks,

4041
05:46:36,266 --> 05:46:38,344
newspapers and publishing houses
Jewish-owned,

4042
05:46:38,401 --> 05:46:40,309
for nearly 70 years the demonization
of Adolf Hitler

4043
05:46:40,344 --> 05:46:41,987
has been almost relentless.

4044
05:46:54,737 --> 05:46:56,167
HITLER
The rise of evil

4045
05:47:00,438 --> 05:47:01,464
You made a fool out of me!

4046
05:47:01,886 --> 05:47:03,956
Tried to humiliate me!

4047
05:47:04,936 --> 05:47:06,796
You must learn to sit down!

4048
05:47:07,355 --> 05:47:08,427
Learn to...
- That's enough.

4049
05:47:14,757 --> 05:47:16,758
Of the many hundreds of anti-"Nazi"
films released since 1945,

4050
05:47:17,244 --> 05:47:18,904
one film more than any other
has influenced

4051
05:47:19,443 --> 05:47:21,115
how millions perceive Germany's
role in World War Two.

4052
05:47:22,068 --> 05:47:23,895
Filmed in black and white for a
claim to authenticity,

4053
05:47:24,332 --> 05:47:26,401
it was then sold to the public
as a true story.

4054
05:47:27,367 --> 05:47:29,096
Despite the scenes of nudity and
violence

4055
05:47:29,606 --> 05:47:32,448
it was shown to children in schools
in the US and Europe as mandatory viewing.

4056
05:47:48,098 --> 05:47:50,221
Schindler's List

4057
05:47:51,554 --> 05:47:55,198
First of all, the film is
based upon this book,

4058
05:47:55,795 --> 05:48:02,326
Schindler's List, which won the
L.A. Times book award for FICTION.

SCHINDLER'S LIST
Tomas Keneally

4060
05:48:08,116 --> 05:48:13,007
Here we have a film that's being
shown to our schoolchildren as truth,

4061
05:48:13,615 --> 05:48:16,702
when it's based on the book
that says this is a work of fiction.

4062
05:48:17,086 --> 05:48:18,284
In other words, it's not true.

4063

"Names, characers, places and
incidents

4064

05:48:27,589 --> 05:48:29,063
or are used ficiously".

7 OSCARS WINNER

4068
05:49:26,478 --> 05:49:29,453
WHAT IF GERMANY HAD WON?

4069
05:49:35,276 --> 05:49:37,152
A war-torn Europe would have been
spectaculary rebuilt,

4070
05:49:37,614 --> 05:49:39,234
supervised by Hitler's architect
Abert Speer.

4071
05:49:39,827 --> 05:49:42,122
Berlin, now renamed Germania,
would be the capital of Europe.

4072
05:49:42,539 --> 05:49:44,531
All Europeans would have benefied
from the German "Economic Miracle".

4073
05:49:44,736 --> 05:49:46,577
No USSR and thus no Cold War
or "Iron Curtain".

4074
05:49:46,708 --> 05:49:48,836
No Red China and the subsequent
killing of 40-60 million Chinese.

4075
05:49:48,875 --> 05:49:50,276
No Communism anywhere.

4076
05:49:50,809 --> 05:49:52,541
The end of the political ideology
known as Zionism.

4077
05:49:53,678 --> 05:49:55,851
A Palestine free from Israeli and the
relocation of Jews to Madagascar.

4078
05:49:56,417 --> 05:49:58,296
Greater stability in a Middle East
without Israel.

4079
05:49:58,917 --> 05:50:00,367
No fictious "War of Terror".

4080
05:50:00,707 --> 05:50:03,054
A ban on usury and privately-owned
central banks.

4081
05:50:03,444 --> 05:50:05,094
Abolishment of Freemasonry.

4082
05:50:05,777 --> 05:50:07,851
No depraved Hollywood movie
industry.

4083
05:50:08,441 --> 05:50:10,121
No "political correctness".

4084
05:50:10,440 --> 05:50:12,698
An emphasis on traditional
family values.

4085
05:50:13,605 --> 05:50:17,759
No Cultural Marxism or Liberalism
and their devastating consequences:

4086
05:50:17,794 --> 05:50:18,622
Drugs

4087
05:50:19,057 --> 05:50:20,081
Abortion

4088
05:50:20,557 --> 05:50:21,524
Pornography

4089
05:50:22,040 --> 05:50:23,125
Open homosexuality

4090
05:50:23,686 --> 05:50:25,024
Radical feminist movement

4091
05:50:25,670 --> 05:50:27,917
No multiculturalism and present Jewish
policy of forced Third World,

non-Western immigration

"It has gotten so bad

in this sick world we
live in,

4097
05:50:44,639 --> 05:50:46,495
that now some leaders
of nations are

4098
05:50:46,903 --> 05:50:51,943
openly promoting genocide
of the European people.

4099

Sarkozy went on to say that...

4100
05:51:11,354 --> 05:51:13,303
"I think there's a resurgence
of anti-Semitism

4101
05:51:13,623 --> 05:51:15,485
because at this point in time

4102
05:51:15,851 --> 05:51:18,514
Europe has not yet learned
how to be multicultural.

4103
05:51:18,973 --> 05:51:21,284
And I think we are going to
be part of the throes of that...

4104
05:51:21,669 --> 05:51:24,429
of that transformation
which must take place.

4105
05:51:24,845 --> 05:51:27,028
Europe is not going to be the
monolithic

4106
05:51:29,077 --> 05:51:31,251
societies that they once were in
the last century.

4107
05:51:31,602 --> 05:51:33,178
Jews are going to be
at the center of that.

4108
05:51:33,554 --> 05:51:35,873
It's a huge transformation
for Europe to make.

4109
05:51:36,528 --> 05:51:38,683
They are now going
into a multicultural mode.

4110
05:51:39,271 --> 05:51:41,743
And Jews will be resented
because of our leading role.

4111
05:51:42,207 --> 05:51:43,660
But without that leading role,

4112
05:51:44,038 --> 05:51:46,527
and without that transformation,
Europe will not survive.

And I'm sure no intelligent
white person watching this show,

4117
05:52:05,782 --> 05:52:09,803
or no intelligent white man
in his or her right white mind,

4118
05:52:10,441 --> 05:52:13,607
want black boys and black girls
marrying their white sons and daughters,

4119
05:52:14,169 --> 05:52:17,006
and in return introducing their
grandchildren as half brown

4120
05:52:17,630 --> 05:52:18,685
kinky haired black people.

4121
05:52:19,053 --> 05:52:19,872
I wouldn't...
- And I am sure...

4122
05:52:20,415 --> 05:52:21,085
I wouldn't object to that.

4123
05:52:21,397 --> 05:52:22,584
Well you wouldn't but
a lot of them would.

4124
05:52:22,792 --> 05:52:24,462
Well, I will tell you you're
sad... that it's... it is sad

4125
05:52:24,532 --> 05:52:25,923
It ain't sad cause I want
my child to look like me.

4126
05:52:26,260 --> 05:52:28,084
Every intelligent person
wants his child to look like him.

4127
05:52:28,611 --> 05:52:31,849
I'm sad because I want to blot out my
race and lose my beautiful identity?

4128
05:52:32,178 --> 05:52:32,905
You can do what you want!

4129
05:52:33,068 --> 05:52:34,997
But it's nature to want
to be with your own.

4130
05:52:35,985 --> 05:52:36,925
I want to be with my own...

Adolf Hitler - The Gretest Story NEVER Told!

4136
05:55:28,646 --> 05:55:31,104
General Otto Ernst Remer - in Conversation
with Adolf Hitler

4137
05:55:36,937 --> 05:55:39,177
In 1944, General Otto Ernst Remer

4138
05:55:39,696 --> 05:55:41,497
commander in charge of the defence
of the Wolfsschanze

4139
05:55:42,159 --> 05:55:44,437
aseked the Führer if he could have
waited before invading Poland?

4140
05:55:45,134 --> 05:55:46,311
Hitler replied:

4141
05:55:46,913 --> 05:55:47,850
"You are mistaken.

4142
05:55:48,384 --> 05:55:50,216
I knew as early as March 1939
that Roosevelt had determined

4143
05:55:50,744 --> 05:55:53,609
to bring about a world war, and I knew
that British were cooperating in this,

4144
05:55:54,127 --> 05:55:55,487
and Churchill was involved.

4145
05:55:56,226 --> 05:55:58,554
God knows that I certainly did not want
a world war.

4146
05:55:59,128 --> 05:56:01,212
That's why I sought to solve the
Polish problem in my own way

4147
05:56:02,104 --> 05:56:04,457
with a kind of punishment expedition,
without a deklaration of war.

4148
05:56:05,688 --> 05:56:07,825
After all, there had been thousend
of murders of ethnic Germans

4149
05:56:08,660 --> 05:56:10,581
and 1.2 million ethnic German refugees.

4150
05:56:11,317 --> 05:56:12,588
What should I have done?

4151
05:56:13,419 --> 05:56:15,561
I had to act. And for that reason,

4152
05:56:16,145 --> 05:56:18,167
four weeks after this campain,
I made the most generous offer

4153
05:56:18,694 --> 05:56:21,213
of peace that any victorious leader
could ever have made.

4154
05:56:22,461 --> 05:56:24,211
Unfortunately, it wasn't successful...

4155
05:56:27,095 --> 05:56:28,974
If I had ot acted as I did with regard
to the Polish question,

4156
05:56:29,790 --> 05:56:32,079
to prevent a second world war,
by the end of 1942 at latest

4157
05:56:32,916 --> 05:56:35,588
we would have experiecing what
we are now experieced in 1944."

4158
05:56:55,290 --> 05:56:56,576
WE DEFEATED THE WRONG ENEMY

4159
05:57:14,609 --> 05:57:16,676
After the war, General George S. Patton,
commander of the US Third Army,

4160
05:57:17,248 --> 05:57:20,124
openly admitted that the Allies had
fought the wrong people.

4161
05:57:21,509 --> 05:57:22,676
He said about Soviets:

4162
05:57:24,328 --> 05:57:26,567
"Let's not give them time to build up
their supplies.

4163
05:57:27,312 --> 05:57:30,079
If we do, then... we have had a victory
over the Germans, and disarmed them,

4164
05:57:30,608 --> 05:57:33,490
but we have failed in the liberation
of Europe; we have lost the war!"

4165
05:57:34,463 --> 05:57:35,800
He wrote to is wife:

4166
05:57:36,694 --> 05:57:38,702
"If we have to fight them,
now is the time.

4167
05:57:39,694 --> 05:57:41,600
From now on we will get weaker
and they stronger."

4168
05:57:56,586 --> 05:57:59,607
The media would now begin a campaign
to discredit General Patton.

4169
05:58:00,438 --> 05:58:01,988
Patton, on 22 September 1945:

4170
05:58:02,801 --> 05:58:04,634
"There is a very apparent Semitic
influence in the press.

4171
05:58:05,305 --> 05:58:07,797
They are traying to do two things:
first, implement Communism.

4172
05:58:08,419 --> 05:58:10,320
And second, see that all businessmen
of German ancestry

4173
05:58:10,855 --> 05:58:12,483
an non-Jewish entcendents are
thrown out of their jobs...

4174
05:58:12,997 --> 05:58:14,933
... in my opinion and most
nonpolitical officers,

4175
05:58:15,557 --> 05:58:17,477
it is vitally necessary for us
to build Germany up now

4176
05:58:18,140 --> 05:58:19,779
as a buffer state against Russia.

4177
05:58:20,296 --> 05:58:21,822
In fact, I am afraid we have waited
too long."

4178
05:58:22,574 --> 05:58:24,625
And in a letter later that night
to his wife:

4179
05:58:25,553 --> 05:58:27,823
"I can't tell them the truth that unless
we restore Germany

4180
05:58:28,447 --> 05:58:30,399
we will ensure that Communism
takes America."

4181
05:58:39,960 --> 05:58:41,867
George S. Patton Jnr. died in a
Heidelberg,

4182
05:58:42,444 --> 05:58:44,507
Germany hospital 21 December 1945,

4183
05:58:45,057 --> 05:58:47,866
do to complications from a broeken neck
he sustained eleven days earlier

4184
05:58:48,530 --> 05:58:50,095
in a minor automobile accident.

4185
05:58:50,929 --> 05:58:53,390
No official report was made of the incident,
and there was to be no autopsy.

4186
05:58:54,318 --> 05:58:56,678
The postmortem findings remain
classified to this day.

4187
05:59:11,699 --> 05:59:14,068
Patton's prophetic warnings
ultimately went unheeded.

4188
05:59:31,745 --> 05:59:34,054
General George S. Patton
1885- 1945

4189
05:59:44,660 --> 05:59:46,972
WE FOUGHT TO SAVE EUROPE

4190
05:59:52,861 --> 05:59:56,061
A group of German Wor War Two
veterans explain to a Dutch journalist

4191
05:59:56,729 --> 05:59:58,905
how they fought to save from te wrath
of the Bolsheviks

4192
05:59:59,425 --> 06:00:01,337
not only Germany, but all of Europe.

4193
06:00:07,242 --> 06:00:10,539
We didn't fight againt you.
- Just against the Russians?

4194
06:00:11,442 --> 06:00:16,446
To be exact, not against the Russians,
but against bolshevism.

4195
06:00:17,862 --> 06:00:22,902
They were people like you and I.
- Against Stalinist bolshevism.

4196
06:00:23,590 --> 06:00:29,022
We defended our country against it,
and more importantly, all of Europe.

4197
06:00:30,110 --> 06:00:35,964
If we hadn't stopped it, it would have
reached your country and France too.

4198
06:00:37,095 --> 06:00:39,591
Right up to the Channel.
Tht was their plan.

4199
06:00:40,064 --> 06:00:43,311
We also had to fight the Americans
when they landed...

4200
06:00:43,825 --> 06:00:46,407
in France, Italy and Africa.

4201
06:00:47,416 --> 06:00:52,623
In the end the Russians sometimes
outnumbred us by twelwe to one.

4202
06:00:53,592 --> 06:00:57,399
And we still tried to keep them away
from the borders of the Reich.

4203
06:01:00,190 --> 06:01:01,673
To defend our people.

4204
06:01:12,311 --> 06:01:15,657
The French Charlemagne SS were the last
defenders of Hitler's bunker, fighting until

4205
06:01:16,402 --> 06:01:18,798
2 May to prevent the Bolscheviks from
capturing it on May Day.

4206
06:01:19,828 --> 06:01:22,417
Reduced from over 7.000 to approximately
30 able men, most of those who made it

4207
06:01:23,056 --> 06:01:25,242
back to France were denounced and
sent to Allied prison camps.

4208
06:01:26,458 --> 06:01:29,437
French General Philippe Leclerc was presented
with a defiant group of 12 captured

4209
06:01:30,036 --> 06:01:31,677
Charlemagne SS men.

4210
06:01:33,506 --> 06:01:35,946
The General immediatrely asked them
way they wore a German uniform,

4211
06:01:36,569 --> 06:01:39,341
to which one of them replied by asking
the General way he wore an American one?

4212
06:01:41,907 --> 06:01:44,657
The 12 French Charlemagne SS men were
later executed without any form of

4213
06:01:45,335 --> 06:01:47,031
due process.

4214
06:02:11,655 --> 06:02:14,023
Henri Joseph Fenet, one of the last
recipiens of the Knight's Cross,

4215
06:02:14,566 --> 06:02:16,521
was sentenced to 20 years hard labour.

4216
06:02:17,009 --> 06:02:17,710
He was released in 1959.

4217
06:02:19,297 --> 06:02:22,070
We didn't think of death at all.

4218
06:02:23,311 --> 06:02:24,575
Henry Frenet, French volonteer

4219
06:02:24,885 --> 06:02:26,042
Not at all.

4220
06:02:26,491 --> 06:02:29,058
Only on fighting, keeping on fighting.

4221
06:02:35,337 --> 06:02:38,476
We lived and fought only to fight.

4222
06:02:44,443 --> 06:02:45,564
Loyal to the end.

4223
06:02:50,427 --> 06:02:52,019
Loyal to the end.

4224
06:03:00,779 --> 06:03:04,818
More French soldiers died fighting
for Germany than for France aiding Communism.

4225
06:03:05,395 --> 06:03:07,962
Many more volunters travelled from
around the world to stand

4226
06:03:08,531 --> 06:03:09,803
alongside the Germans in the
defence of Europe.

4227
06:03:10,307 --> 06:03:12,545
Those captured faced either execution,
enslavement or imprisonment.

4228
06:03:13,193 --> 06:03:15,322
Some would starveand die alongside
the Germans in Eisenhower's death camps.

4229
06:03:16,121 --> 06:03:18,809
Volunteers from the following countries
would fight for the Third Reich:

4230
06:03:19,865 --> 06:03:21,279

06:04:03,122 --> 06:04:04,739
"Now, I have only one regret...

4247
06:04:07,136 --> 06:04:09,744
... I wished an earlier involvement"
Henri Joseph Fenet

4248
06:04:15,963 --> 06:04:18,009
The Freikorps Oberland was a unit in
the early years of Weimar Republic,

4249
06:04:18,601 --> 06:04:20,735
known for their street battles against
Communist and Polish insurgens.

4250
06:04:22,126 --> 06:04:24,129
Fridolin von Spaun, the last living
member, describes meeting

4251
06:04:24,945 --> 06:04:26,550
Adolf Hitler for the first time.

4252
06:04:36,637 --> 06:04:39,170
He was indeed observing me.

4253
06:04:43,082 --> 06:04:47,402
And that was one of the most
curious moment of my life.

4254
06:04:48,873 --> 06:04:52,410
I had the feeling that he was
searching somehow-

4255
06:04:53,201 --> 06:04:56,865
the gaze which at first rested
competely on me

4256
06:04:57,409 --> 06:05:04,421
suddenly went straight through me
and into an unknown distance.

4257
06:05:05,965 --> 06:05:08,223
It was so strange.

4258
06:05:14,585 --> 06:05:18,260
And the long gaze which
he had given me

4259
06:05:19,131 --> 06:05:21,688
convinced me completely

4260
06:05:23,066 --> 06:05:26,568
that he was a man of
honourable intentions.

4261
06:05:28,160 --> 06:05:31,210
I can only say I am glad

4262
06:05:31,553 --> 06:05:38,543
that I saw Hitler's most
beautiful side.

4263
06:05:40,687 --> 06:05:42,743
Surely there must have been
dark sides,

4264
06:05:45,293 --> 06:05:48,193
but I saw his wonderful side.

4265
06:05:49,288 --> 06:05:51,389
And nobody can take that
away from me.

4266
06:06:04,059 --> 06:06:06,717
"Lord God, give us the strength that we
may retain our liberty for our children

4267
06:06:07,341 --> 06:06:09,531
and our children's children, not only
for ourselves, but also

4268
06:06:10,084 --> 06:06:12,486
for the other peoples opf Europe,
for thi is a war which we all wage,

4269
06:06:13,015 --> 06:06:15,552
this time, not for our German people alone,
it is a war for all of Europe and with it

4270
06:06:16,133 --> 06:06:19,314
in the long run, for all of
mankind."... Adolf Hitler 1942

4271
06:06:33,538 --> 06:06:35,698
THE END

4272
06:06:47,170 --> 06:06:49,334
The consequences of Germany's defeat
are still being felt today.

4273
06:06:50,008 --> 06:06:51,815
In the decades since the end
of World War Two,

4274
06:06:52,479 --> 06:06:54,830
the German birth rate has fallen below
the repacement level.

4275
06:06:55,534 --> 06:06:57,716
Millions of racially and culturally alien
migrants have been welcomed as settlers

4276
06:06:58,371 --> 06:06:59,331
in Germany.

4277
06:06:59,923 --> 06:07:01,996
The number of children of mixed ethnicity
has sharply increased.

4278
06:07:02,829 --> 06:07:04,807
As a result, the ethnic and cultural
character of much of the country

4279
06:07:05,328 --> 06:07:06,778
has been drastically altered.

4280
06:07:07,441 --> 06:07:08,991
Germany remains occupied.

4281
06:07:24,696 --> 06:07:25,959
Joseph Stalin

4282
06:07:26,471 --> 06:07:28,257
Real name:
Josif Vissarionovich Dzhgashvili

4283
06:07:29,366 --> 06:07:31,188
Died 5 March 1953, aged 74.

4284
06:07:32,077 --> 06:07:33,826
Stalin had collapsed amids rumours
he had been poisoned.

4285
06:07:35,298 --> 06:07:37,529
After the fall of Communism, document
No. 103202/06, signed by

4286
06:07:38,215 --> 06:07:40,268
Soviet Chief of Staff Kirill Mereskov on
18 September, 1940

4287
06:07:40,938 --> 06:07:42,908
revealed that Stalin was preparing
to invade western Europe on

4288
06:07:43,430 --> 06:07:44,729
10 July, 1941

4289
06:07:45,298 --> 06:07:46,889
in a massive military offensive
operation code-named

4290
06:07:47,616 --> 06:07:49,206
OPERATION THUNDER

4291
06:07:50,269 --> 06:07:52,332
Germany had invaded the Soviet Union
to only 3 weeks to spare.

4292
06:08:01,968 --> 06:08:02,954
Franklin D. Roosevelt

4293
06:08:03,547 --> 06:08:05,556
Died April 12, 1945 aged 63
from a brain hemorrhage.

4294
06:08:07,411 --> 06:08:09,490
Despite funding one of history's most
murderous regimes,

4295
06:08:10,083 --> 06:08:12,097
and despite his knowledge that US
had broken Japanese code

4296
06:08:12,724 --> 06:08:14,673
prior to the strike on Pearl Harbor,
FDR remains one of

4297
06:08:15,225 --> 06:08:17,032
America's most popular president.

4298
06:08:24,154 --> 06:08:25,084
Winston Churchill

4299
06:08:25,593 --> 06:08:27,752
Died 24 January 1965, aged 90 after
suffering a stroke.

4300
06:08:29,406 --> 06:08:31,113
Although he is regarded as Britain's
greatest statesman,

4301
06:08:31,665 --> 06:08:34,479
Winston Churchill has never been forgiven
by the Welsh for sending the British Army

4302
06:08:35,039 --> 06:08:36,688
to break up the 1910 Miners'
strike in South Wales.

4303
06:08:37,225 --> 06:08:39,442
The result was the death of two miners
and a bayonet charge on an unarmed crowd.

4304
06:08:39,943 --> 06:08:42,601
In 1965, the Welsh Valleys celebrated
upon hearing of Churchill's death.

4305
06:08:51,896 --> 06:08:53,072
Harry S. Truman

4306
06:08:53,855 --> 06:08:55,800
Died on 26 December 1972, aged 88
after a complexity of organ failures.

4307
06:08:56,902 --> 06:08:58,741
He will be remembered most for
ending the worst war in history

4308
06:08:59,436 --> 06:09:01,044
by the heinous act of dropping
the atomic bomb

4309
06:09:01,667 --> 06:09:03,569
on civilian targets without
warning... twice.

4310
06:09:10,946 --> 06:09:13,481
According to official reports and
eyewitness testimonies:

4311
06:09:15,914 --> 06:09:17,274
Adolf Hitler

4312
06:09:18,033 --> 06:09:20,482
Died 30 April 1945, aged 56,
defending his beloved Germany.

4313
06:09:24,640 --> 06:09:27,080
"Adolf Hitler, son of the Catholic Church,
died while defending Christianity.

4314
06:09:27,752 --> 06:09:29,799
It is therefore understandable that
words cannot be found

4315
06:09:30,392 --> 06:09:33,294
to lament over his death, when so
many were found to exalt his life.

4316
06:09:34,054 --> 06:09:36,223
Over his mortal remains stands his
victorious figure.

4317
06:09:36,958 --> 06:09:39,078
With the palm of the martyr, God
gives Hitler the laurels of Victory."

4318
06:09:40,413 --> 06:09:42,369
Francisco Franco
Head of Spain

4319
06:09:42,847 --> 06:09:44,166
3 May 1945

4320
06:09:58,229 --> 06:10:00,030
"It is necessary that I should die
for my people;

4321
06:10:00,733 --> 06:10:03,810
but my spirit will rise from the grave
and the world will knowthat I was right."

4322
06:10:04,507 --> 06:10:06,131
Adolf Hitler 1945

4323
06:10:16,299 --> 06:10:19,193
In memory of the many thousands
massacred at Bleiburg...

4324
06:10:23,410 --> 06:10:26,101
... and the millions who fought
for a better world.

4325
06:10:37,111 --> 06:10:38,892
Since the making of this documentary,
in 2012 the headstone overlooking

4326
06:10:39,370 --> 06:10:41,698
the grave of Adolf Hitlers's parents
Alois and Klara was removed.

4327
06:10:55,059 --> 06:10:58,557
No one knows what it's like

4328
06:10:58,657 --> 06:11:01,855
To be the bad man

4329
06:11:02,355 --> 06:11:05,653
To be the sad man

4330
06:11:06,652 --> 06:11:09,950
Behind blue eyes

4331
06:11:10,950 --> 06:11:12,949
No one knows

4332
06:11:13,049 --> 06:11:17,846
What it's like to be hated

4333
06:11:18,845 --> 06:11:26,291
To be faded to telling only lies

4334
06:11:26,391 --> 06:11:33,837
But my dreams they aren't as empty

4335
06:11:33,937 --> 06:11:41,332
As my conscious seems to be

4336
06:11:42,332 --> 06:11:49,827
I have hours, only lonely

4337
06:11:49,927 --> 06:11:53,575
My love is vengeance

4338
06:11:53,675 --> 06:11:57,323
That's never free

4339
06:12:03,020 --> 06:12:06,218
No one knows what it's like

4340
06:12:06,318 --> 06:12:09,916
To feel these feelings

4341
06:12:10,016 --> 06:12:17,411
Like I do, and I blame you!

4342
06:12:19,210 --> 06:12:22,508
No one bites back as hard

4343
06:12:22,608 --> 06:12:26,006
On their anger

4344
06:12:26,106 --> 06:12:29,404
None of my pain woe

4345
06:12:29,504 --> 06:12:32,803
Can show through

4346
06:12:34,102 --> 06:12:41,298
But my dreams they aren't as empty

4347
06:12:42,397 --> 06:12:48,294
As my conscious seems to be

4348
06:12:50,093 --> 06:12:57,288
I have hours, only lonely

4349
06:12:57,788 --> 06:13:01,286
My love is vengeance

4350
06:13:01,786 --> 06:13:05,184
That's never free

4351
06:14:35,732 --> 06:14:39,130
No one knows what it's like

4352
06:14:39,230 --> 06:14:43,277
To be the bad man

4353
06:14:43,377 --> 06:14:46,900
To be the sad man

4354
06:14:47,000 --> 06:14:50,523
Behind blue eyes

4355
06:14:53,421 --> 06:14:55,320
No one knows

4356
06:14:55,420 --> 06:15:00,397
What it's like to feel these feelings

4357
06:15:00,497 --> 06:15:07,313
Like I do, and I blame you!

4358
06:15:07,713 --> 06:15:11,911
But my dreams

4359
06:15:12,011 --> 06:15:15,009
They aren't as empty

4360
06:15:15,608 --> 06:15:22,704
As my conscience seems to be

4361
06:15:23,704 --> 06:15:30,700
I have hours, only lonely

4362
06:15:31,599 --> 06:15:34,598
My love is vengeance

4363
06:15:35,497 --> 06:15:38,995
That's never free

4364
06:16:46,816 --> 06:16:48,270
Without the miracle of the internet

4365
06:16:48,798 --> 06:16:50,140
this documentary could not
have been possible.

4366
06:17:08,998 --> 06:17:10,318
... And the women was arrayed in
purple and scarlet colour,

4367
06:17:10,774 --> 06:17:12,294
and decked with gold and precious
stones and pearls,

4368
06:17:12,683 --> 06:17:13,826
having a golden cup in fer hand

4369
06:17:14,339 --> 06:17:15,710
full of abominations and filthiness
of her fornication:

4370
06:17:16,109 --> 06:17:18,070
And upon her forehead was a name
written, Mystery, Babylon The Great,

4371
06:17:18,517 --> 06:17:19,885
The Mother Of Hurlots
And Abominations Of The Earth.

4372
06:17:20,381 --> 06:17:21,875
Book of Revelation
Chapter 17

4373
06:17:31,668 --> 06:17:33,152
During the1920's, Berlin became known
as the cesspit of Europe,

4374
06:17:33,662 --> 06:17:35,102
a city where any and every depraved
sexual acivity

4375
06:17:35,510 --> 06:17:36,820
could be had at a price.

4376
06:17:37,256 --> 06:17:39,118
With drugs, prostitution, peadophilia
and homosexuality

4377
06:17:39,581 --> 06:17:41,052
and even bestiaity rampant, it was
a place dangerous and unfit

4378
06:17:41,539 --> 06:17:43,003
for any self-respecting German
family to reside.

4379
06:17:43,551 --> 06:17:45,782
Against all odds, in 1933 one man
would drive the "Whore of Babyon" from Berlin

4380
06:17:46,215 --> 06:17:48,551
and out of Germany, restoring
family morals once again.

4381
06:18:00,526 --> 06:18:02,124
BABYLON BEFORE HITLER

4382
06:18:11,611 --> 06:18:15,470
After the armistice, the guns
went silent across Europe,

4383
06:18:15,570 --> 06:18:19,429
but not in Berlin, where
Germans were fighting Germans.

4384
06:18:20,310 --> 06:18:23,690
News of the loss by the Fatherland,
had come as a shock to Berliners,

4385
06:18:24,188 --> 06:18:26,136
and now the old order was gone.

4386
06:18:27,109 --> 06:18:29,200
In its place came chaos.

4387
06:18:31,509 --> 06:18:34,865
The streets of what was once
a quiet conservative town,

4388
06:18:35,314 --> 06:18:36,953
became free fire zones.

4389
06:18:37,908 --> 06:18:39,551
The Nationalists in the extreme right,

4390
06:18:39,904 --> 06:18:42,540
battling it out with the Communists
of the extreme left.

4391
06:18:43,164 --> 06:18:44,086
And out of this struggle,

4392
06:18:44,666 --> 06:18:48,910
emerged a new democratic state,
the Weimar Republic.

4393
06:18:53,534 --> 06:18:56,188
In the 20th century,
after the First World War,

4394
06:18:56,923 --> 06:19:00,419
the world's great metropolis
of vice was Berlin.

4395
06:19:04,859 --> 06:19:08,714
Berlin in the 1920s was
the sex capital of Europe.

4396
06:19:22,204 --> 06:19:25,048
If you knew what to look for
you could find anything,

4397
06:19:25,395 --> 06:19:27,090
anything known to man
David Clay Large - Author

4398
06:19:27,648 --> 06:19:30,960
in the sexual world was
available on the streets of Berlin.

4399
06:19:32,694 --> 06:19:33,754
On any given night,

4400
06:19:34,258 --> 06:19:37,599
as many as a 100.000 prostitutes
walked the streets,

4401
06:19:38,040 --> 06:19:40,175
or worked the sex
clubs across the city.

4402
06:19:41,318 --> 06:19:44,191
There were all different whores
with, um...

4403
06:19:44,512 --> 06:19:45,974
different kinds of make-up
on the street.

4404
06:19:46,591 --> 06:19:48,139
For instance, one
was called "Munzi".

4405
06:19:49,126 --> 06:19:53,669
Munzis, who were prostitutes who hung
out on just one street, munzstrasse,

4406
06:19:54,196 --> 06:19:55,821
and these were
pregnant prostitutes.

4407
06:19:56,601 --> 06:19:58,389
There were prostitutes who looked
horrible,

4408
06:19:58,821 --> 06:20:02,234
who had massive scared faces
or hunched backs or

4409
06:20:02,587 --> 06:20:06,594
were lame or crippled, these
were called "grasshoppers".

4410
06:20:09,307 --> 06:20:12,778
You had mother and daughter teams
on one street, that dressed exactly alike.

4411
06:20:16,177 --> 06:20:16,909
Here in Berlin,

4412
06:20:17,493 --> 06:20:20,570
sex for sale offered every
sort of perversion

4413
06:20:21,018 --> 06:20:22,649
or fetishism imaginable.

4414
06:20:23,264 --> 06:20:24,827
There was not a sexual appetite

4415
06:20:25,298 --> 06:20:27,754
that could not be satisfied;
in the city.

4416
06:20:30,813 --> 06:20:35,860
There were clubs where lesbians
liked to whip school boys

4417
06:20:36,780 --> 06:20:41,436
and you'd find military officers sitting
there with children sitting on their laps.

4418
06:20:42,745 --> 06:20:44,405
So a lot of it was play acting.
Ean Wood - Author

4419
06:20:44,971 --> 06:20:48,170
But there were quite a lot of people
who also indulged in it.

4420
06:20:49,443 --> 06:20:53,637
Berlin in the 1920s was
the sex capital of Europe.

4421
06:20:54,849 --> 06:20:58,018
Its very name became synonymous
with perversion,

4422
06:20:58,466 --> 06:21:01,202
debauchery, and creativity.

4423
06:21:01,302 --> 06:21:05,171
Places that you hadn't noticed
would turn into outrageous strip clubs.

4424
06:21:05,885 --> 06:21:07,263
The basements of the restaurants

4425
06:21:07,571 --> 06:21:11,822
would be homosexual or lesbian
romper rooms and sex clubs.

4426
06:21:12,793 --> 06:21:14,983
Every intellectual was Leftish.

4427
06:21:15,774 --> 06:21:20,500
The whole political right wing,
which basically came from Munich,

4428
06:21:20,960 --> 06:21:22,984
did not play any
roll in the beginning.

4429
06:21:23,470 --> 06:21:26,728
The whole town was in
the hands of Leftist ideas.

4430
06:21:27,918 --> 06:21:29,184
But outside Berlin,

4431
06:21:29,926 --> 06:21:31,719
the right wing Nationalist movement

4432
06:21:31,855 --> 06:21:34,536
was attracting scores of
disillusioned Germans,

4433
06:21:35,099 --> 06:21:38,173
including one obscure Austrian
Corporal

4434
06:21:38,702 --> 06:21:40,694
by the name of Adolf Hitler.

4435
06:21:41,786 --> 06:21:45,716
Hitler, like many of the right
wingers, hated this new Berlin.

4436
06:21:46,338 --> 06:21:51,430
A city bursting with Bolsheviks,
socialists, revolutionaries, and Jews.

4437
06:21:51,989 --> 06:21:53,930
But in the early 1920s,

4438
06:21:54,486 --> 06:21:56,928
Berliners
had more immediate concerns.

4439
06:21:57,689 --> 06:22:02,630
By 1922, inflation was
spiraling wildly out of control.

4440
06:22:03,028 --> 06:22:05,063
People would be paid in the
morning,

4441
06:22:05,435 --> 06:22:07,266
and have suitcase fulls of bank
notes.

4442
06:22:07,743 --> 06:22:09,750
And they would have to then
run to the shops,

4443
06:22:10,120 --> 06:22:11,792
because in the time between
being paid,

4444
06:22:12,158 --> 06:22:14,640
and the time when they bought
their goods, their food,

4445
06:22:14,975 --> 06:22:16,247
the prices would have risen.
Anton Gill - Author

4446
06:22:16,925 --> 06:22:19,770
Berlin was in a state of total,
total chaos.

4447
06:22:20,312 --> 06:22:23,607
Hundreds of thousands of
dispossessed starving in the streets

4448
06:22:24,033 --> 06:22:27,177
and at the same time,
you had very rich people.

4449
06:22:28,280 --> 06:22:31,256
You got on the one hand,
the poor eating turnip soup,

4450
06:22:31,957 --> 06:22:35,150
the Butchers selling
crows, squirrels, even rats.

4451
06:22:35,849 --> 06:22:38,085
And on the other side,
people who could afford it,

4452
06:22:38,499 --> 06:22:42,419
eating the most sumptuous meals,
like they never paused for thought.

4453
06:22:44,051 --> 06:22:48,310
With virtually every currency in the world
more valuable than the German mark,

4454
06:22:49,086 --> 06:22:50,912
foreign tourists flocked into
the city

4455
06:22:51,314 --> 06:22:55,649
to take advance of the cheapest
sex on the continent.

4456
06:22:55,687 --> 06:22:59,344
$10 dollars in American money,
could buy you anything you wanted.

4457
06:23:03,282 --> 06:23:07,866
Every possible sexual
taste was catered for.

4458
06:23:09,372 --> 06:23:11,239
House Fraus became harlots,

4459
06:23:11,750 --> 06:23:15,661
teenagers turned tricks,
and Papa became a pimp.

4460
06:23:18,002 --> 06:23:19,003
When you have unemployed,

4461
06:23:19,693 --> 06:23:22,895
you also have an increase
in sex workers.

4462
06:23:24,680 --> 06:23:26,400
But it wasn't just Berliners.

4463
06:23:27,180 --> 06:23:31,380
It was tens and maybe hundreds of
thousands of young boys and young girls,

4464
06:23:31,480 --> 06:23:32,272
who were coming to Berlin

4465
06:23:32,631 --> 06:23:37,112
to participate
in this hard currency sex traffic.

4466
06:23:38,279 --> 06:23:40,316
It was a city that was
filled with lesbian life.

4467
06:23:40,706 --> 06:23:43,105
There was the idea that every where
you went,

4468
06:23:43,428 --> 06:23:44,880
you didn't have to hide what
you were.

4469
06:23:45,657 --> 06:23:46,977
Marlene
DIETRICH

4470
06:23:58,435 --> 06:24:02,380
When it came to sex Marlene
Dietrich could be omnivorous.

4471
06:24:02,754 --> 06:24:04,176
As long as she found them
attractive,

4472
06:24:04,671 --> 06:24:07,734
she couldn't care less if her
lover was a man or a women.

4473
06:24:08,642 --> 06:24:11,290
Dietrich was an omnipotent
sexual figure.

4474
06:24:11,969 --> 06:24:15,881
She was an icon for gay women
around the world

4475
06:24:16,497 --> 06:24:18,969
at a time when there was no
one else.

4476
06:24:21,261 --> 06:24:23,365
With this new anything goes
attitude,

4477
06:24:23,773 --> 06:24:27,542
Berlin over night replaced Paris
as the center of Hedonism.

4478
06:24:29,974 --> 06:24:35,573
That's why people saw Berlin
as the Babylon of the 20s.

4479
06:24:35,673 --> 06:24:39,573
Things that had been considered
to be immoral amoral whatever,

4480
06:24:39,673 --> 06:24:42,892
were became irrelevant
and anything went.

4481
06:24:44,109 --> 06:24:46,051
Drugs were readily
available in Berlin.

4482
06:24:46,407 --> 06:24:49,588
Every variety of drug.
Morphine, cocaine, opium.

4483
06:24:50,484 --> 06:24:52,447
The morphine and cocaine you could
probably get prescribed

4484
06:24:52,746 --> 06:24:54,529
by your local doctor or pharmacist.

4485
06:24:55,193 --> 06:24:56,753
Opium was widely available,

4486
06:24:57,165 --> 06:25:00,467
and also drugs were used in
sexual science.

4487
06:25:01,010 --> 06:25:03,848
Sexual scientists were very
interested in the effects of for instance

4488
06:25:04,184 --> 06:25:06,994
morphine would have on the
orgasmic rate of a lesbian.

4489
06:25:07,641 --> 06:25:09,394
So there was a
complete scientific culture.

4490
06:25:13,420 --> 06:25:16,545
Berlin had become the center
of sexual experimentation.

4491
06:25:17,255 --> 06:25:20,759
It also became the center of
scientific research into sex,

4492
06:25:21,132 --> 06:25:22,834
led by a pioneering doctor.

4493
06:25:23,554 --> 06:25:24,257
von Dr. Magnus Hirschfeld

4494
06:25:24,292 --> 06:25:28,393
And this was a very funny character
called Papa or the Einstein of sex.

4495
06:25:29,168 --> 06:25:30,874
In Berlin, it was Magnus Hirshfeld.

4496
06:25:31,480 --> 06:25:35,251
Hirshfeld was queer Jewish Social
democrat,

4497
06:25:35,604 --> 06:25:38,147
who really defined the Liberal spirit
of Berlin.

4498
06:25:40,539 --> 06:25:42,667
The crusading doctor for sexual freedom

4499
06:25:43,097 --> 06:25:45,689
was also the founder of the world's
first institute

4500
06:25:46,145 --> 06:25:49,224
devoted to the
scientific study of sex.

4501
06:25:51,466 --> 06:25:54,645
You could go and look at various
fetish items,

4502
06:25:54,967 --> 06:25:56,836
for example he had these trousers.

4503
06:25:57,274 --> 06:25:59,323
Now if you wore a trench coat
you could walk around Berlin,

4504
06:25:59,799 --> 06:26:01,009
and look like you had pants on,

4505
06:26:01,337 --> 06:26:03,549
because the lower parts of
the trousers were there.

4506
06:26:03,878 --> 06:26:07,189
But then you had nothing on above
them, and you could flash this way.

4507
06:26:08,164 --> 06:26:11,371
This was thought to be
very tidily very amusing.

4508
06:26:11,799 --> 06:26:16,795
So it was this sort of thing, you could
see in the institute for sexual research.

4509
06:26:18,111 --> 06:26:20,895
Unlike his fellow doctor
in Vienna, Sigmund Freud,

4510
06:26:21,567 --> 06:26:23,794
Hirshfeld advocated the radical
notion

4511
06:26:24,466 --> 06:26:26,618
that human sexuality could be
studied,

4512
06:26:27,130 --> 06:26:29,440
without imposing moral judgements.

4513
06:26:31,174 --> 06:26:35,189
Hirshfeld's also credited with operations
and surgeries of sex change

4514
06:26:35,499 --> 06:26:36,668
and sexual rejuvenation.

4515
06:26:39,292 --> 06:26:43,069
He had a clinic for people to be
consoled about sexual problems.

4516
06:26:44,661 --> 06:26:48,565
But Berlin's reputation as a
hotbed for the new and risque,

4517
06:26:49,149 --> 06:26:52,461
was not just limited to
its bars and bedrooms.

4518
06:26:55,659 --> 06:26:59,551
They also streamed into the
city streets and clubs of Berlin.

4519
06:27:00,247 --> 06:27:03,694
From all across Europe, artists,
writers, and intellectuals

4520
06:27:03,991 --> 06:27:05,174
with homosexual leanings

4521
06:27:05,975 --> 06:27:07,870
were drawn to this metropolis.

4522
06:27:09,258 --> 06:27:13,062
Berlin was unquestioningly the
most open gay city in the world.

4523
06:27:13,799 --> 06:27:16,941
It attracted first W. H. Auden,
the great British poet,

4524
06:27:17,259 --> 06:27:18,558
and then his friend, Christopher
Isherwood.

4525
06:27:19,657 --> 06:27:20,670
Auden came first,

4526
06:27:21,257 --> 06:27:22,467
was interested in the gay scene there,

4527
06:27:22,835 --> 06:27:25,310
and talked about Berlin being
a bugger's paradise.

4528
06:27:27,057 --> 06:27:29,314
Christopher Isherwood,
fed up with Cambridge,

4529
06:27:29,737 --> 06:27:32,332
and an England openly hostile to
homosexuals,

4530
06:27:33,099 --> 06:27:34,642
chose to move to Berlin.

4531
06:27:35,428 --> 06:27:39,201
His novels about the wild side of
life in the city and its cabarets,

4532
06:27:40,103 --> 06:27:44,520
were eventually turned into a hugely
successful stage play and movie.

4533
06:27:46,754 --> 06:27:50,566
There were about a 160 completely
different

4534
06:27:51,066 --> 06:27:54,171
lesbian and gay male night clubs
and lounges.

4535
06:27:55,527 --> 06:27:59,148
Unlike most cities, with
their one red light district,

4536
06:27:59,582 --> 06:28:03,502
Berlin's erotic clubs were scattered
throughout the vast metropolis.

4537
06:28:08,290 --> 06:28:12,897
Bizarre sexual fantasies of domination,
were turned into works of art.

4538
06:28:13,927 --> 06:28:18,303
While they would indulge in a wide
variety of strange sexual experiments

4539
06:28:18,639 --> 06:28:21,830
involving violence and death;
all in the name of art.

4540
06:28:23,454 --> 06:28:26,517
In 1928, a Nazi propaganda sheet,

4541
06:28:26,916 --> 06:28:31,221
denounced Berlin as a melting
pot of everything that is evil.

4542
06:28:32,003 --> 06:28:34,225
When Goebbels got off the
train in 1926,

4543
06:28:34,792 --> 06:28:35,937
to take over the city,

4544
06:28:36,680 --> 06:28:39,933
he found the Nazis could scrape
together maybe 200 members.

4545
06:28:40,778 --> 06:28:44,077
And the Communists at
that point had about 250.000.

4546
06:28:44,241 --> 06:28:47,552
And they didn't particularly take to a
group of people who came in from outside

4547
06:28:48,193 --> 06:28:49,889
and said that everything
that the city had stood for

4548
06:28:50,526 --> 06:28:52,504
was all of a sudden to be abandoned
or to be considered decadent

4549
06:28:52,874 --> 06:28:54,042
or to be pushed aside.

4550
06:28:55,229 --> 06:28:58,245
Hitler had personally
appointed him to go to Berlin.

4551
06:28:58,894 --> 06:29:01,990
It looked at the time like
an impossible mission.

4552
06:29:02,452 --> 06:29:04,925
He was a good choice for the Nazis
because he understood the city.

4553
06:29:05,647 --> 06:29:09,946
It was he who was designated to turn
the city from a bastion of Communism,

4554
06:29:10,046 --> 06:29:12,851
a red city, into a brown
one, a bastion of the Nazi's.

4555
06:29:13,107 --> 06:29:14,244
This was a difficult proposition.

4556
06:29:14,846 --> 06:29:17,145
Berlin to them was
foreign territory.

4557
06:29:17,245 --> 06:29:19,445
They shared the typical provincial,

4558
06:29:19,545 --> 06:29:24,745
conservative German's notion
about Berlin as a decadent place.

4559
06:29:24,845 --> 06:29:27,445
It was too avant-garde,
they hated the place.

4560
06:29:27,545 --> 06:29:29,894
Berlin was in an upheaval.

4561
06:29:29,994 --> 06:29:32,319
Street fights were common.

4562
06:29:32,419 --> 06:29:35,190
Unemployment was worsening.

4563
06:29:35,290 --> 06:29:38,061
And then on January 30th, 1933,

4564
06:29:38,558 --> 06:29:42,000
Hitler was appointed Chancellor
of Germany.

4565
06:29:42,843 --> 06:29:45,775
He made it clear what
his plans for the city were.

4566
06:29:46,643 --> 06:29:49,399
"What is ugly in Berlin,
we shall remove."

4567
06:29:54,342 --> 06:29:56,425
What happened in '33, especially,

4568
06:29:56,845 --> 06:29:59,600
was that the gay Berlin dime bars
started to be raided.

4569
06:29:59,967 --> 06:30:02,325
Those things were allowed to kind
of exist under the radar,

4570
06:30:02,998 --> 06:30:05,472
for, up until 1933 really.

4571
06:30:05,848 --> 06:30:09,094
The Nazi police started paying
attention to the dime bars.

4572
06:30:09,390 --> 06:30:11,456
They were harassing the customers,
they were closing them down;

4573
06:30:11,910 --> 06:30:12,758
you might get arrested.

4574
06:30:13,440 --> 06:30:17,877
The Eldorado, home for some of the
most famous transvestites in the city,

4575
06:30:18,440 --> 06:30:21,739
was taken over and turned
into Nazi headquarters.

4576
06:30:22,339 --> 06:30:25,164
Goebbels sang out the name
of every book

4577
06:30:25,276 --> 06:30:27,948
as it was consigned to the flames,
legend has it.

4578
06:30:35,338 --> 06:30:38,837
The exodus was almost immediate.

4579
06:30:38,937 --> 06:30:45,459
Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill, George Grosz,
Albert Einstein, Marlene Dietrich,

4580
06:30:45,737 --> 06:30:48,037
just a small number of the
thousands

4581
06:30:48,638 --> 06:30:49,991
who were driven into exile.

4582
06:30:54,536 --> 06:30:59,735
Berlin for a short 14 years,
had been a crucible of history.

4583
06:30:59,835 --> 06:31:04,274
Brimming with a volatile mix
of sex, arts, and politics,

4584
06:31:04,374 --> 06:31:08,814
laced with disillusionment,
and spiked with decadence.

4585
06:31:14,534 --> 06:31:17,568
The Babylon of the river
supreme was no more.
