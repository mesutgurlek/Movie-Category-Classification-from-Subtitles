1
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:36,953
- Janek!
- Here I am, Baron.

2
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:39,185
Come on.

3
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,098
Rub hard.

4
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,462
- Everybody here?
- No, Baron. Not everybody.

5
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:56,564
Who's missing?

6
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,870
Mr. Bruckmann
and <i>Hauptsturmfûhrer</i> Aschenbach...

7
00:02:59,946 --> 00:03:02,414
who still have to arrive from Oberhausen.

8
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,378
And the old man? Baron Joachim.

9
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:10,945
Come on, talk.

10
00:03:11,991 --> 00:03:14,459
Baron Joachim is in his apartment.

11
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:18,185
He's getting dressed for dinner,
and so are the others.

12
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,771
- And my son?
- Can't you hear him?

13
00:03:40,587 --> 00:03:42,851
Gunther.

14
00:03:46,559 --> 00:03:48,891
- What do you want, Thilde?
- Come.

15
00:03:54,834 --> 00:03:56,165
Come.

16
00:03:57,370 --> 00:03:59,065
What do you want?

17
00:03:59,839 --> 00:04:00,897
See.

18
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:04,810
Just like last year, Thilde.
No more, no less.

19
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,172
Yes, but last year
I was part of the audience.

20
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,613
Instead, this evening it will be different.

21
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:13,880
- I hope I don't forget my part.
- It will be a grand debut.

22
00:04:13,953 --> 00:04:17,116
Tomorrow, your name
will be in all the newspapers.

23
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:56,292
All right. Thank you. All right.

24
00:05:11,077 --> 00:05:13,545
A little compromise today and tomorrow...

25
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,844
and one fine day
we won't even be able to find our chairs.

26
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,381
Yes, dear.

27
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,478
I'm almost ready.

28
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,155
You know how Uncle Joachim
insists on punctuality...

29
00:05:26,225 --> 00:05:29,023
- especially this evening.
- Please, help me.

30
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,458
- Darling, stay still.
- Thank you, dear.

31
00:05:34,534 --> 00:05:37,992
You see, one can't always be saying "yes."
They're not reasonable people.

32
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:40,767
The more you give them to eat,
the more ravenous they become.

33
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:44,435
Darling, it's 40 years
that Uncle Joachim's been at the helm...

34
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:47,640
and always with equilibrium and firmness.

35
00:05:47,714 --> 00:05:50,444
Equilibrium. You've used the right word.

36
00:05:53,119 --> 00:05:56,145
A favor to the Liberals,
one to the National Socialists.

37
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:58,349
A favor to me, and one to Konstantin.

38
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:02,758
Herbert, you're not being fair.
Joachim is certainly not soft with that...

39
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:05,593
- particular gentleman.
- Because he's a snob.

40
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,532
If Hitler wasn't the son of a customs agent
and a servant...

41
00:06:08,601 --> 00:06:11,126
Joachim would have already
thrown himself in his arms.

42
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,229
Yes, but you must admit
he took your advice...

43
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,501
and didn't give a mark
to the National Socialists.

44
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:18,100
That's only because he's so miserly.

45
00:06:23,182 --> 00:06:27,050
- The children?
- You'll be hearing them soon enough.

46
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,088
They must be so nervous.

47
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:36,420
- Come on, Herbert. Let's go, we're late.
- Thank you.

48
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,326
- Come, darling.
- Yes.

49
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,227
<i>"Now I can feel</i>

50
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,826
<i>"now I can feel them in my little heart</i>

51
00:06:44,904 --> 00:06:48,704
<i>"But there are too many</i>
<i>and I can't repeat all of them</i>

52
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:51,471
<i>"If you wish to read them</i>

53
00:06:51,544 --> 00:06:53,705
<i>"come closer</i>

54
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,749
<i>"Put your head on my breast</i>
<i>and listen carefully</i>

55
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,875
<i>"listen carefully"</i>

56
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,851
Happy birthday.

57
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,659
Best wishes for your birthday.

58
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:16,291
Come here. I thank you.

59
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,770
I thank you, too, my little dear.

60
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,505
- Happy birthday, sir.
- Janek.

61
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,895
- Listen. Do you hear them?
- Yeah.

62
00:07:55,508 --> 00:07:59,137
Ever since she was born, she was told,
"You are the most intelligent...

63
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:03,239
"you're the richest, the most envied,
you're the Baroness von Essenbeck."

64
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,809
How can I ask her
just to become Mrs. Bruckmann?

65
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,388
The wife of an ordinary executive
of the steelworks which bear her name.

66
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,792
An ordinary executive
is not exactly the right term.

67
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:17,291
You have Uncle Joachim's confidence.

68
00:08:17,363 --> 00:08:21,424
And Herbert and Konstantin
would never make a decision without you.

69
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:25,194
- Doesn't that mean anything to you?
- Something.

70
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:27,569
But it's not enough for Sophie.

71
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:33,278
I've made a career for myself,
but I'll always be one of her employees.

72
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:36,311
If we decided to get married tomorrow...

73
00:08:36,382 --> 00:08:39,510
old Joachim would lose
that confidence and liking for me.

74
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,319
He likes to believe
that she's the inconsolable widow...

75
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:46,922
of the adored son, the hero.

76
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:50,751
Idiot!

77
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,822
He'd probably sack me on the spot,
you know, Wolfe.

78
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,027
No, Frederick, you're wrong.

79
00:08:56,769 --> 00:09:01,001
Today, not even his 10,000 slaves
working in his mines and factories...

80
00:09:01,607 --> 00:09:05,668
not even his money, his castles,
have enough power to put you out...

81
00:09:05,978 --> 00:09:08,105
because we have the power...

82
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:11,649
and we want you to remain where you are.

83
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:14,709
If anything,
we want you to climb even higher.

84
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:21,092
Over whom should I climb? Herbert?

85
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:25,853
Though the fact that Herbert's
got to climb down is no news to anyone.

86
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:29,959
His hostility towards
the National Socialists is too apparent.

87
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:33,964
- But Konstantin...
- Konstantin?

88
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,838
Does he have that much effect on you?

89
00:09:38,444 --> 00:09:40,742
Well, he's a member of the SA.

90
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,107
He has connections with Rõhm.

91
00:09:43,182 --> 00:09:46,083
Our large industries
will need men like you.

92
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:51,683
And our chancellor
has a weakness for big industrialists.

93
00:09:57,296 --> 00:10:01,460
In any case,
it wasn't Konstantin I had in mind.

94
00:10:06,906 --> 00:10:10,672
<i>"Can you feel?</i>
<i>Can you feel how much I love you?</i>

95
00:10:10,743 --> 00:10:13,735
<i>"Then I don't have to write it down</i>
<i>for you"</i>

96
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,510
Do you think they would agree
to an encore?

97
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:24,283
I think even more than one,
so don't risk asking for it.

98
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,087
Then I will give up the idea.

99
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,617
That was beautiful.

100
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:33,529
Wonderful, my dear.
You were perfect, Thilde.

101
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,193
Come, sit down. Thank you so much.

102
00:10:36,268 --> 00:10:38,293
Thank you. Bravo.

103
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,539
Very good.

104
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:10,356
You are the first to hold yourself back.

105
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:24,171
You seem to be ambitious,
but you're only a social climber.

106
00:12:24,243 --> 00:12:26,234
Sophie wouldn't be happy.

107
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:31,642
You worry too much
about Herbert and Konstantin.

108
00:12:31,717 --> 00:12:36,313
And you forget, there's somebody much
more important than they are: Joachim.

109
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:43,986
You must realize that today, in Germany,
anything can happen...

110
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:47,226
even the improbable,
and it's just the beginning.

111
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,162
"Personal morals are dead.

112
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:52,636
"We are an elite society
where everything is permissible."

113
00:12:52,838 --> 00:12:54,703
These are Hitler's words.

114
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:58,403
My dear Frederick,
even you should give them some thought.

115
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:09,178
Tonight, for example.

116
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:45,221
Wonderful, my dear. Perfectly good.

117
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,089
I've so enjoyed it. Thank you so much.

118
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:54,096
I know it doesn't matter to you,
but your son is really talented.

119
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:59,033
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

120
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,971
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

121
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,331
I'm sorry. Telephone.

122
00:16:06,098 --> 00:16:09,465
A little silence, please. Silence, please.

123
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:13,166
In Berlin, the Reichstag is burning.

124
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:29,711
Stop! Did you hear, stop it!

125
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:35,893
The fire started half an hour ago.
A conspiracy, no doubt.

126
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:39,693
But I think
they've already arrested the guilty one.

127
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,526
A Dutchman.
A member of the Communist Party.

128
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:45,263
Communist, of course!

129
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:50,167
A grave Communist crime
against the new government.

130
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,866
<i>Reich scum!</i>

131
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,375
They could've chosen another day
to burn the Reichstag.

132
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,479
Right, Grandfather?
They ruined your birthday.

133
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,771
It was my headquarters in Berlin.

134
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:00,509
They still have not been able
to put out the fire.

135
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:05,047
The Berliners are on the terraces
enjoying the spectacle.

136
00:18:07,853 --> 00:18:09,582
Perhaps I shouldn't be here.

137
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:12,283
The SA have been confined
to their barracks.

138
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,458
Keep calm, Konstantin.
The coup d'état has failed.

139
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,721
Whatever your battleground is,
it's not Berlin...

140
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,165
or at least it never has been until now.

141
00:18:23,235 --> 00:18:27,865
In any case, the fact that we've uncovered
the leaders of this conspiracy proves...

142
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:31,000
What conspiracy?
It's clear it's only a pretext.

143
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,401
That's far-fetched, Herbert.

144
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:38,175
Herbert's theories are always far-fetched.

145
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,846
It's a deliberate provocation.

146
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:46,991
It can only be somebody
who's against the government.

147
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:50,028
If there is anyone who doesn't need
a parliament to govern us...

148
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:51,858
it's your chancellor.

149
00:18:52,764 --> 00:18:54,356
Herbert, please.

150
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,366
All Germany knows
there's a list of proscribed people.

151
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:04,034
Now's the moment to get rid of
all opposition without trial and publicity...

152
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:05,804
with all Europe looking on!

153
00:19:05,878 --> 00:19:08,506
The internal order of Germany
cannot interest Europe.

154
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,013
What internal order?

155
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,983
The kind that allows his friends
to enter homes and kill?

156
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,848
Herbert, please.

157
00:19:16,855 --> 00:19:19,824
Didn't your Gõring
promise the enemies of the Third Reich...

158
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:23,988
- enough rope to hang themselves?
- You're losing your head, Herbert.

159
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:28,529
Gõring refers to the Communists.
Perhaps you're a Communist, too.

160
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,933
Today it's the Communists.
And tomorrow?

161
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:34,100
Don't worry about tomorrow.

162
00:19:34,373 --> 00:19:36,739
At this very moment,
there's someone in Berlin...

163
00:19:36,808 --> 00:19:38,867
who's already doing the worrying.

164
00:19:39,044 --> 00:19:42,480
- Isn't that so?
- Well said, cousin Sophie.

165
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:47,717
Our only worry should be the
celebration of Uncle Joachim's birthday.

166
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:51,481
Even if this is not a night
like all the others.

167
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:10,030
Happy Birthday

168
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:44,905
For a long time...

169
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,375
I have intended telling you...

170
00:20:49,381 --> 00:20:51,645
what I am now about to say.

171
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,681
The dramatic events...

172
00:20:57,389 --> 00:21:00,324
which occurred in these last few hours...

173
00:21:00,959 --> 00:21:04,053
force me to overcome any hesitation...

174
00:21:04,796 --> 00:21:06,627
and uncertainty...

175
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,590
and go ahead.

176
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:12,737
In all these years...

177
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,666
you know that I have had only one object:

178
00:21:19,044 --> 00:21:23,572
To hold on to
the unity and prestige of our firm.

179
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:29,014
For that reason,
I always tried to adjust our work...

180
00:21:29,554 --> 00:21:32,148
and our structure...

181
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:35,352
according to the circumstances.

182
00:21:37,362 --> 00:21:41,321
During the Great War, during peace...

183
00:21:42,534 --> 00:21:43,796
during...

184
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:45,796
crisis.

185
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,130
Now, in the face...

186
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,404
of these recent dramatic events...

187
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,268
I maintain...

188
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:58,112
that it is more than ever necessary...

189
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:02,043
to protect the Essenbeck Steelworks...

190
00:22:02,421 --> 00:22:05,788
from eventual political pressures...

191
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,290
or from...

192
00:22:09,528 --> 00:22:12,622
even greater risks.

193
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:19,729
You must admit
that I never yielded to this regime.

194
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:24,034
And everybody knows I never had...

195
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:30,044
and never will have a rapport
with that... gentleman.

196
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:38,222
Nevertheless, in the interests
of the factory...

197
00:22:40,425 --> 00:22:43,155
our production activity...

198
00:22:43,995 --> 00:22:48,056
compels us to keep in daily contact...

199
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,567
with these people.

200
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,972
This is why I feel an indispensable need...

201
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:58,271
to have at my side a man...

202
00:22:58,477 --> 00:23:01,378
in favor of the regime...

203
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:04,381
- who can guarantee us...
- All right.

204
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:07,509
My resignation
has been ready for some time, Joachim...

205
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:09,816
if this is what you're asking.

206
00:23:10,255 --> 00:23:12,951
I am forced to do it, Herbert...

207
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:16,820
against my will
and without strong conviction.

208
00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:20,021
- But the steelworks...
- Yes.

209
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,726
Right or wrong,
they must always come first.

210
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,631
That has always been your creed.

211
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:27,194
You sent your son to the slaughter,
so you could say:

212
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:31,140
"The Essenbecks put children and cannons
into the world with the same sentiment."

213
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:34,235
And with the same sentiment
they'll be buried.

214
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,680
Forgive me.

215
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,617
I congratulate you, Konstantin.

216
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:47,383
You'll be the vice president
that we deserve.

217
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:53,695
Come, Herbert. Please.

218
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,976
I hope I don't follow in the footsteps...

219
00:24:07,345 --> 00:24:09,006
of my predecessor.

220
00:24:10,715 --> 00:24:12,376
Agreed, Frederick?

221
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,886
<i>"Children, the young ones</i>
<i>are coming out of my ears</i>

222
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,192
<i>"A man, a real man</i>

223
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:26,895
<i>"Children, the young ones</i>
<i>are coming out of my ears</i>

224
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:31,133
<i>"A man, a real man"</i>

225
00:24:33,004 --> 00:24:37,168
If it suited him, Aschenbach
would stab me in the back. I know that.

226
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:41,435
But not this time. He's on my side.

227
00:24:42,581 --> 00:24:44,310
On our side, Sophie.

228
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,177
Herbert was right.

229
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:51,478
They did set the Reichstag on fire.
Coming here in the car tonight...

230
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:56,425
Aschenbach was perfectly clear in his own
mind that it was going to be successful.

231
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:02,491
We talked about you and about me,
about Joachim, about the steelworks.

232
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:06,528
And underneath all that...

233
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,699
he was saying:

234
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,936
"Tonight, you will be
given a special opportunity.

235
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:18,278
"It's up to you to decide
whether to take it or not.

236
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,612
"Whether to be with us or against us."

237
00:25:22,821 --> 00:25:25,312
You understand what that means, Sophie?

238
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:36,793
I can't believe they'd put Joachim's name
on the proscription list.

239
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:39,632
He's much too important
to the steelworks.

240
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,838
For Herbert, perhaps, it's probably over.

241
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,508
Strange things
will happen tonight, probably.

242
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,648
And the only losers will be the onlookers.

243
00:25:50,715 --> 00:25:54,651
I feel as if I've been given
a special mission.

244
00:25:56,388 --> 00:26:00,586
And if I accept it, if I take that chance...

245
00:26:02,327 --> 00:26:04,625
they'll give me all their help.

246
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,198
And there won't any more be a Herbert...

247
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,564
or a Konstantin, or a Joachim.

248
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,501
I will be in command.

249
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:18,474
I will make decisions. You and I, Sophie.

250
00:26:26,918 --> 00:26:28,818
What have you decided?

251
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:36,121
It would be the first decision I'd taken...

252
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:38,458
without consulting you.

253
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,521
You did well, Frederick...

254
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:44,794
even if I will never know
how to push you enough.

255
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:51,868
Go, and go to the limit.

256
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,104
None of them are worth
even half of what you are.

257
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:57,580
You did well to wait,
or to say yes, to thank them.

258
00:26:57,649 --> 00:26:59,844
But now you must make it pay!

259
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,847
All the times
that Herbert tried to push you aside...

260
00:27:02,921 --> 00:27:05,185
that Joachim looked down on you...

261
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:08,919
and Konstantin, with his protective air,
always trying to help you...

262
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,895
to offer you a hand. He's the worst of all.

263
00:27:16,501 --> 00:27:18,401
Don't be afraid, Frederick.

264
00:27:19,871 --> 00:27:21,395
I'm not afraid.

265
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:27,904
All we have to do now
is to convince your son...

266
00:27:29,414 --> 00:27:33,544
- that I can do the job.
- I'll take care of Martin.

267
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:38,453
I know Martin's desires.

268
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,293
He has no sense of values.

269
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:57,032
The steelworks or a Rolls,
it's all the same to him.

270
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:02,178
We will throw him the bait. Leave it to me.

271
00:28:08,119 --> 00:28:10,087
- I've won!
- Yes, you've won.

272
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,986
- Where's Erika?
- Erika, come!

273
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:16,084
- I've won, you can come out now.
- Erika! Where are you?

274
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:22,666
- Here I am.
- There you are, you naughty little thing.

275
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:26,329
Come here. Now it's your turn. Come.

276
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,543
Put your hands over your eyes. Like that.

277
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:37,304
Now count up to 100, out loud.

278
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:41,477
One, two, three...

279
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:43,914
four, five, six...

280
00:28:44,289 --> 00:28:46,382
seven, eight, nine...

281
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,926
ten, eleven, twelve...

282
00:28:48,993 --> 00:28:50,893
thirteen, fourteen...

283
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,474
Erika. Come!

284
00:29:23,895 --> 00:29:28,332
Drink! Let's not talk any more. Drink!

285
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:33,827
- I will not leave my school.
- You'll leave that dirty hole!

286
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:37,139
You'll come with me to the factory.

287
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,800
I'll drag you if necessary.

288
00:29:41,646 --> 00:29:46,583
But I swear, in 10 years,
you will be in a position of command.

289
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:50,213
In a position to even throw me out.

290
00:29:50,822 --> 00:29:54,724
At the cost of breaking
that damn cello over your head.

291
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:01,193
You're getting to be like your mother.
The same delicate stomach!

292
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:06,035
Never wanted to put her foot
inside the factory.

293
00:30:09,741 --> 00:30:13,871
The heat of the ovens made her giddy.

294
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:20,181
- Listen, Papa, I have decided...
- I'll decide for you.

295
00:30:25,390 --> 00:30:27,824
I know. You can't bear me.

296
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:35,065
But even I don't ask that you love me.

297
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:37,561
On the contrary.

298
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,534
I don't intend to leave that seat...

299
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:46,338
to that eager Frederick, neither to Martin.

300
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,108
I'll tie you to it...

301
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:54,008
when your time comes,
and God help me if I don't.

302
00:30:55,987 --> 00:30:58,717
Those bastards have poisoned your mind.

303
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:02,490
But we'll tear
that school of yours to pieces...

304
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:06,328
including all their bloody damned books!

305
00:31:08,466 --> 00:31:09,694
Gunther!

306
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:23,707
- Erika.
- Do you want her to find us quickly?

307
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:47,364
Come in.

308
00:31:57,782 --> 00:31:59,010
Come in.

309
00:32:01,819 --> 00:32:03,116
All right.

310
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:06,955
As I foresaw.

311
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:09,983
Before daybreak, Herbert will be arrested.

312
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:19,230
Poor Herbert! And to think
that we're so close to the border.

313
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:26,671
Will there be a trial?
Is there a specific charge?

314
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,907
I don't believe
such formalities are necessary.

315
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:36,644
We just have to be careful
of their substance...

316
00:32:40,358 --> 00:32:42,519
and the substance is this:

317
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:48,957
Before the flames of the Reichstag
are put out...

318
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:53,362
the men of old Germany
will be reduced to ashes.

319
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:03,338
Nevertheless, a semblance of legality...

320
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,907
can also be useful sometimes.

321
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:13,612
But now you must excuse me.
I'm tired and would like to retire.

322
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,859
If you need me.

323
00:33:39,650 --> 00:33:42,278
But to leave like this, like thieves.

324
00:33:43,087 --> 00:33:45,555
We are not the only ones, Elizabeth.

325
00:33:45,623 --> 00:33:50,356
Every day there are a lot of people who
have to leave for other parts of Europe.

326
00:33:50,428 --> 00:33:54,159
We are among the more fortunate.
At least we know where we're going.

327
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,927
- We have friends.
- But when?

328
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:03,239
The time it takes to get ready
and hand over the office at the factory.

329
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:09,645
It's all over, Gunther.

330
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:16,350
It was our fault. Everyone's, even mine.

331
00:34:16,687 --> 00:34:19,281
It does no good to raise your voice
when it's too late...

332
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:21,450
not even to save your soul.

333
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:24,791
All we have done
is give Germany a sick democracy.

334
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:27,154
The fear of a proletarian revolution...

335
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:30,200
which would have thrown the country
to the Left was too great...

336
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:35,103
and now we can't defend it any longer.
Nazism, Gunther, is our creation.

337
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:38,998
It was born in our factories,
nourished with our money.

338
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:43,405
I know what you're thinking:
That I shouldn't run away...

339
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,779
- and perhaps you're hating me for it.
- No, Uncle Herbert.

340
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:55,386
- We'll keep in contact, won't we?
- Yes.

341
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:59,586
It's so late. What are you doing?

342
00:34:59,831 --> 00:35:02,527
- Where's Thilde? Do you know, Erika?
- I don't know.

343
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:05,263
Thilde!

344
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:18,307
Herbert, they're here.

345
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,174
They've come to take you.
You haven't a moment to lose.

346
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:23,907
- Elizabeth.
- No!

347
00:36:23,981 --> 00:36:26,449
Herbert, you haven't got
a moment to lose. Hurry!

348
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,348
- Don't go.
- Hurry!

349
00:36:57,648 --> 00:36:59,582
- You're mad to take that. Give it to me.
- No!

350
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,244
I'll get rid of it for you. Now hurry.

351
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:09,884
Herbert! Darling, quickly.

352
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:16,028
- Take care of the children.
- Go, my love.

353
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,295
Herbert, don't. This way.

354
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:36,678
Open!

355
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:03,137
You, too, recognize this weapon?

356
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:05,907
Yes.

357
00:38:07,084 --> 00:38:10,520
The weapon apparently
belongs to Mr. Herbert Thallman.

358
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,881
Should we continue
with our investigation?

359
00:38:42,753 --> 00:38:45,483
Let's leave it to the legal authorities.

360
00:38:47,758 --> 00:38:50,454
Mr. Thallman has taken a file
of compromising documents...

361
00:38:50,528 --> 00:38:53,964
concerning the most recent research
in the steelworks.

362
00:38:54,398 --> 00:38:57,196
It could be very useful outside the Reich.

363
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,130
He cannot make any concrete use of it.

364
00:39:19,857 --> 00:39:21,984
"To the prosecuting attorney.

365
00:39:24,128 --> 00:39:26,722
"February 18, 1933.

366
00:39:28,966 --> 00:39:30,194
"Subject:

367
00:39:31,435 --> 00:39:35,064
"The incrimination
of Herbert Thallman, fugitive...

368
00:39:36,741 --> 00:39:38,834
"for the first-degree murder...

369
00:39:39,243 --> 00:39:42,735
"of Baron Joachim von Essenbeck."

370
00:40:09,173 --> 00:40:12,074
I know what you are feeling,
my dear Martin.

371
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:17,410
But you can't, from one day to another...

372
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:25,388
assume such a big responsibility...

373
00:40:25,456 --> 00:40:28,118
without feeling, let's say...

374
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,588
afraid.

375
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:35,098
But neither I nor Frederick
will leave you alone.

376
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,223
We say, however...

377
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:40,759
that you have all the time
to continue your studies...

378
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,970
and to take in hand
the problems of the firm.

379
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,479
They aren't small problems, believe me.

380
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:57,277
Meanwhile, Frederick and I
will keep the business going...

381
00:40:57,822 --> 00:41:00,552
as we have always done in the past.

382
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:05,518
I had really hoped
that you wouldn't have to assume...

383
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:08,387
the presidency of the steelworks...

384
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:12,930
under such tragic circumstances.

385
00:41:16,907 --> 00:41:18,670
But unfortunately...

386
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:22,805
I still wanted to say that...

387
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,148
Grandfather was right.

388
00:41:29,386 --> 00:41:32,514
In these times, our plant...

389
00:41:33,224 --> 00:41:35,658
Yes, after all...

390
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:42,331
either it is in agreement
with the government...

391
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:45,391
or else our business, our advantages...

392
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:55,469
I don't pretend to be a businessman,
not even a politician.

393
00:41:55,746 --> 00:41:57,976
However, this I know, too...

394
00:41:59,683 --> 00:42:02,982
it's a matter of fact of special production.

395
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,320
There are technical problems.

396
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,118
Good.

397
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:13,160
Very good.

398
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,425
You've even made a crowning speech.

399
00:42:18,435 --> 00:42:21,700
Now, however, don't exaggerate.

400
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:25,507
Let's try to give this meeting...

401
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:30,445
a rather more familiar tone?

402
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:36,709
- Joachim's intentions...
- I beg you, Konstantin!

403
00:42:38,088 --> 00:42:41,580
Martin has not finished.
He's still saying something.

404
00:42:41,659 --> 00:42:43,126
Let's listen.

405
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:48,562
Uncle Konstantin,
I will respect all of Grandfather's will.

406
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:57,638
He has nominated you vice president,
and it's fair that it should be so.

407
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:03,576
But I think that in a moment like this...

408
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:07,878
I think, yes, in a moment like this,
the presidency...

409
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,346
above all, needs a technician.

410
00:43:16,627 --> 00:43:18,788
What kind of a joke is this?

411
00:43:18,862 --> 00:43:22,093
It's not a joke.
Enormous interests are at stake.

412
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:27,699
And Martin thinks...

413
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,409
As far as I know, it's the first time...

414
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:35,472
Martin ever used his head to think.

415
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:39,073
I inherit the major stock,
and it's up to me to decide.

416
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:41,313
It is up to me to decide!

417
00:43:48,559 --> 00:43:51,551
I nominate Frederick Bruckmann...

418
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:54,323
president of the administration...

419
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:57,663
and general director
of the Essenbeck Steelworks...

420
00:43:58,402 --> 00:44:01,997
and all its associated member groups.

421
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:09,977
Frederick Bruckmann.

422
00:44:10,547 --> 00:44:15,507
I pulled you up like this
from the nothing that you were.

423
00:44:17,121 --> 00:44:18,816
Herbert's pistol...

424
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:23,225
Aschenbach's testimony,
the arrival of the SS.

425
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:29,759
Too much fantasy, Konstantin.

426
00:44:32,002 --> 00:44:33,629
You come with me.

427
00:44:34,872 --> 00:44:37,363
Today, you, too, learned something.

428
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:41,004
Things you are not taught
in a school like yours.

429
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:43,037
Come.

430
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,415
Don't have any illusions.

431
00:44:56,427 --> 00:44:58,395
This war has just begun.

432
00:45:00,831 --> 00:45:02,765
Gunther, come!

433
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:30,129
To the first model, with the hope
that we will quickly hear its music.

434
00:48:42,386 --> 00:48:45,184
Will this entertainment last much longer?

435
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:49,623
Your place is here, Martin.
You can't leave now.

436
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:51,292
All right, sir.

437
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,067
Mr. Bruckmann.

438
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,500
I don't understand...

439
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:06,064
I knew your father
at the French Front in 1916.

440
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:10,606
A true Essenbeck, and a heroic officer.

441
00:49:11,248 --> 00:49:12,306
I know.

442
00:49:12,382 --> 00:49:16,409
The General Staff is quite firm
on this point. Either Rõhm goes or we go.

443
00:49:16,486 --> 00:49:18,283
It's naked extortion.

444
00:49:18,822 --> 00:49:22,883
The SA is a knife at the throat
of the high finance and the <i>Reichswehr</i>.

445
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,929
Consequently, it'll be necessary
to stop the flow...

446
00:49:25,996 --> 00:49:29,159
of the heavy artillery
into the barracks of the SA.

447
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,061
Is that your personal opinion?

448
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,627
It is the opinion of the general staff.

449
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:40,436
And also of the Chancellor,
if you don't mind my saying so.

450
00:49:40,777 --> 00:49:43,871
The army is the army,
and the SA is the SA.

451
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:46,909
We are not concerned with internal order.

452
00:49:47,050 --> 00:49:50,679
And we will not divide
our traditional duties with others.

453
00:49:50,887 --> 00:49:52,616
Traditional duties?

454
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,687
I'd like to know
where the Prussian generals were...

455
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,957
when we cleaned up Germany
from top to bottom!

456
00:50:00,030 --> 00:50:03,397
- This country will never be clean enough...
- I beg your pardon.

457
00:50:04,234 --> 00:50:05,633
Gentlemen.

458
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:10,829
No one doubts the merits
of the attack formations, dear cousin.

459
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:15,571
We ourselves would not be here
without the work of the SA.

460
00:50:16,213 --> 00:50:19,376
But heavy arms are not needed
for public order.

461
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,149
All you have to do is look around.

462
00:50:23,220 --> 00:50:26,678
Germany is the most orderly country
in the whole world.

463
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:30,393
It's a pleasure
for the American and English tourists.

464
00:50:31,628 --> 00:50:33,493
What more do you want?

465
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:37,926
And so, gentlemen, we're all agreed.

466
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:41,061
Not one single machine gun
leaves this place...

467
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:44,906
unless it is requested by the general staff.

468
00:51:01,591 --> 00:51:04,321
We are close to the elections, Frederick...

469
00:51:04,628 --> 00:51:08,359
and we must win them at all costs
if we want them to be the last.

470
00:51:08,432 --> 00:51:10,866
But you know that takes a lot of money.

471
00:51:11,168 --> 00:51:12,897
Essenbeck is late.

472
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:18,569
Joachim's stubborn hostility has created
this disagreeable state of affairs.

473
00:51:18,708 --> 00:51:21,040
All the other industrialists
have paid their quota...

474
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:25,138
Excuse me. It is difficult to set aside
such a large sum of money...

475
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:27,740
without juggling the balance sheets.

476
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,553
This is a corporation...

477
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:35,357
and as you well know,
Konstantin can be a problem.

478
00:51:37,761 --> 00:51:39,922
If Konstantin wants
to become a problem...

479
00:51:39,996 --> 00:51:44,365
well then, I say that a problem
always can be resolved.

480
00:51:46,069 --> 00:51:47,536
Don't you think so?

481
00:51:47,871 --> 00:51:50,738
"The state cannot but crush
the innocent little flower...

482
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:54,140
- "if the flower obstructs its path."
- I am not the state.

483
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:58,680
I've done everything I was required to do,
and I will involve myself no further.

484
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,147
Come on now!

485
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:03,315
Don't take me up on every word.

486
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:07,313
They are words of Hegel, you know.

487
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,191
He'd turn over in his grave...

488
00:52:11,261 --> 00:52:14,958
at the idea of Konstantin being
compared to his innocent little flower.

489
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:18,958
Don't you think I could go? It's late.

490
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:21,895
Yes, go, Martin.

491
00:52:22,439 --> 00:52:24,430
Thank you. Goodbye.

492
00:52:29,379 --> 00:52:32,712
You will answer for everything
that may happen here.

493
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:35,307
Remember that.

494
00:52:38,622 --> 00:52:43,457
ESSENBECK CAST-STEEL FACTORY
H. ESSENBECK

495
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:17,023
<i>Emmer Street, please. Drive quickly.</i>

496
00:54:09,512 --> 00:54:12,970
- She's not here now. She's gone out.
- Thank you, I know.

497
00:56:13,770 --> 00:56:17,831
Thomas and Heinrich Mann,
Walter Rathenau...

498
00:56:22,879 --> 00:56:25,575
Erich Maria Remarque...

499
00:56:26,883 --> 00:56:29,943
Arnold and Stefan Zweig...

500
00:56:31,988 --> 00:56:33,478
André Gide...

501
00:56:34,958 --> 00:56:36,516
Helen Keller...

502
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:39,222
Margaret Sanger...

503
00:56:40,130 --> 00:56:41,688
Jack London...

504
00:56:42,766 --> 00:56:44,791
George Bernard Shaw...

505
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:47,994
Émile Zola...

506
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,363
Marcel Proust.

507
00:57:58,174 --> 00:57:59,539
Come here.

508
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,676
I had to open it. I'm sorry.

509
00:58:11,554 --> 00:58:15,513
I'm obliged to read the mail,
specially foreign correspondence.

510
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:19,826
Herbert Thallman is my uncle.
It's absurd that I can't receive...

511
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,864
Listen to me, von Essenbeck.

512
00:58:21,931 --> 00:58:25,230
If your uncle had good sense,
he wouldn't write to you here.

513
00:58:25,301 --> 00:58:29,169
Where would you like him to write to me?
He needs help.

514
00:58:29,272 --> 00:58:33,038
- You read that yourself, didn't you?
- I don't want to know anything.

515
00:58:33,142 --> 00:58:35,440
I don't want to be involved in it.

516
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:39,608
I only want you not to drag our institute
in this mess.

517
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:43,785
And then, I can't believe...

518
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:47,754
I refuse to believe what your uncle writes.

519
00:58:51,294 --> 00:58:53,660
- I ask permission to leave.
- Go.

520
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:58,391
And get your hair cut, von Essenbeck.

521
00:58:59,969 --> 00:59:01,231
Yes, sir.

522
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:11,313
Yes, I believe that's all of it.

523
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:15,613
Request for renewal, tax deposit, stamps.

524
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:19,349
- Reason for the trip?
- Vacation.

525
00:59:19,989 --> 00:59:23,618
Vacation. Going alone, Mrs. Thallman?

526
00:59:24,093 --> 00:59:25,720
With my children.

527
00:59:27,096 --> 00:59:30,395
Thilde, age eleven. Erika, eight.
Is that correct?

528
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:32,258
Yes.

529
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,795
Do you intend joining your husband?

530
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:38,664
No.

531
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:42,200
Perhaps you don't know where he is.

532
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:45,139
We are always well-informed, you know.

533
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:48,411
I can't see the difficulty.
We only wish to leave.

534
00:59:48,651 --> 00:59:51,347
Has someone caused you some difficulty?

535
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:54,149
No, not exactly.

536
01:00:01,831 --> 01:00:04,732
Do you know that your husband
has committed murder?

537
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:06,530
That's absurd. A disgrace.

538
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,333
Are you sure? Then why don't you
convince him to come back?

539
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:12,238
- He could prove his innocence.
- But I don't know where he is.

540
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:14,674
What have the children or I
got to do with it?

541
01:00:14,744 --> 01:00:17,542
Is there some charge, perhaps, against us?

542
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:21,014
We don't want to leave, just to get away.

543
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:35,491
- Is someone forcing you to leave?
- No, they're stopping me.

544
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:38,758
Who's stopping you, Mrs...

545
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:41,366
Thallman. Elizabeth Thallman.

546
01:00:41,671 --> 01:00:43,901
Perhaps you mean to insinuate.

547
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:47,776
Answer. Don't be afraid. Answer.

548
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,571
- Good morning.
- Your friend is not at home.

549
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,412
Yes. Okay. Thank you.

550
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,748
She had to go out.
She said she would be back late.

551
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:58,184
All right.

552
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:00,908
Lisa.

553
01:02:03,286 --> 01:02:06,119
Look what I've brought you.
Do you like this little horse?

554
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:09,556
- Yes, thank you.
- You can ride on it. Do you like it?

555
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,794
You can caress it. Try it, Lisa.

556
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:16,926
- It's all yours. Do you like it?
- Yes.

557
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:19,859
You must take care of him.

558
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:23,966
You know, he likes you very much.
He really does.

559
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:14,716
Lisa!

560
01:03:23,499 --> 01:03:25,933
Lisa, why don't you answer me?

561
01:03:50,092 --> 01:03:52,458
- You're a wicked girl, Lisa.
- No!

562
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:59,434
What do you think you're doing?
I've told you not to waste time.

563
01:03:59,669 --> 01:04:01,534
You never do any work.

564
01:04:03,940 --> 01:04:08,604
You stay here and play all day.
Look at the disorder in here.

565
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:13,203
Stop crying, or I'll really give you
something to cry about.

566
01:04:15,518 --> 01:04:18,351
I told you to stop. Didn't you hear me?

567
01:04:19,655 --> 01:04:21,748
Start cleaning up the room.

568
01:04:23,226 --> 01:04:25,353
And the plates need washing.

569
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:28,825
Come on now. Get to work!

570
01:05:25,688 --> 01:05:26,916
Martin.

571
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:33,088
It's you.

572
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:36,461
- I didn't expect to find you here.
- What's the time?

573
01:05:37,366 --> 01:05:40,233
- It's 2:00.
- 2:00.

574
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:44,264
It's so late.
I had a lot of work to do tonight.

575
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:55,542
Help me, I implore you. Help me.

576
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:04,484
I know you're the strongest,
and you can prevent me from going.

577
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,960
But I don't see what's the point.

578
01:06:07,496 --> 01:06:10,090
You can't still be afraid of Herbert.

579
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:14,969
Yes, before maybe, but now!

580
01:06:15,037 --> 01:06:18,598
Now his papers aren't worth anything.
No one's going to listen to him.

581
01:06:18,674 --> 01:06:20,869
Germany can do as she wishes.

582
01:06:21,777 --> 01:06:24,712
You yourselves can do anything you like
in the whole of Europe.

583
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:28,773
Nobody's going to lift a finger
against you. So why keep us here?

584
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:34,214
Oh, yes, because one day
we might remember.

585
01:06:35,124 --> 01:06:38,753
We might say to ourselves what we know
about you, about everyone.

586
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:41,956
But do you think that day
is going to come, Sophie?

587
01:06:42,031 --> 01:06:44,226
No, it's not.

588
01:06:47,770 --> 01:06:51,331
Herbert still deludes himself.
I don't anymore. You never believed it.

589
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:53,568
So why? Why keep us here?

590
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:58,544
Just my presence here
must be unbearable to you...

591
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:01,048
because it makes you remember
when you want to forget.

592
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:03,176
I too, I only want to forget.

593
01:07:03,252 --> 01:07:05,777
So let us go away, Sophie. Let us go.

594
01:07:06,956 --> 01:07:09,322
Just one word, one word from you.

595
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:11,755
One word is enough.

596
01:07:12,194 --> 01:07:16,028
Go. Leave. If this is what you want.

597
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:26,206
Don't fool yourself, however, Elizabeth.

598
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:28,971
Don't dream of coming back one day
to find a Germany...

599
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:33,311
which was so dear to your heart.
It's finished, that Germany. Forever.

600
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:36,617
There will be no other Germany
but this one.

601
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:40,284
And you will not be able to escape it
or avoid it.

602
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:45,450
For it will spread before you know it,
all over Europe, and everywhere.

603
01:08:07,483 --> 01:08:09,576
<i>Hauptsturmfûhrer</i> Aschenbach.

604
01:08:11,987 --> 01:08:13,887
Baroness von Essenbeck.

605
01:08:35,177 --> 01:08:36,269
Lisa.

606
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:38,538
Come.

607
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:47,446
Come, I'll show it to you.

608
01:08:56,832 --> 01:09:00,131
Why were you crying the other day?
I heard you, you know.

609
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:02,466
Did someone hit you?

610
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,205
Your mother?

611
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:09,103
Does she do it often,
on your little tiny ass?

612
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:51,478
Why?

613
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:31,284
Stop it, Martin.

614
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:35,029
Stop it, darling. I've got to go.

615
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:37,930
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to pose.

616
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,494
To pose?

617
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:42,563
No, stay with me.

618
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,270
I'm late.

619
01:10:46,141 --> 01:10:48,109
I've got to go, darling.

620
01:10:49,845 --> 01:10:51,745
Didn't you have enough?

621
01:10:52,648 --> 01:10:55,310
I'm late, darling. I've got to go.

622
01:10:56,218 --> 01:10:58,550
Stop it! Please!

623
01:11:06,295 --> 01:11:08,525
Where the devil is that dress?

624
01:11:13,769 --> 01:11:16,101
Darling, please.

625
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:18,968
Stop it.

626
01:11:20,042 --> 01:11:21,907
That's enough, Martin.

627
01:11:22,444 --> 01:11:26,471
If you want to be of some help,
why don't you tidy up this room a bit?

628
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:28,777
Look what a mess you've made.

629
01:11:30,152 --> 01:11:32,643
And that stupid little girl is ill.

630
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:34,919
- Who?
- Lisa.

631
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,720
I've got to pay for her doctor as well.

632
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:40,559
What's the matter with her?
What's she got?

633
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:43,427
How should I know? Can't understand it.

634
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:47,496
She's got a high temperature.
Last night she was delirious.

635
01:11:48,737 --> 01:11:50,136
I'm so late.

636
01:11:53,275 --> 01:11:55,766
Martin, what's the matter with you?

637
01:11:56,145 --> 01:12:00,081
Why don't you do as I told you?
This room is in such a mess.

638
01:12:03,385 --> 01:12:05,250
Now, I really must go.

639
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:14,653
Darling, when you leave,
lock the door, please.

640
01:12:16,432 --> 01:12:17,660
Goodbye.

641
01:13:24,548 --> 01:13:25,640
Lisa.
