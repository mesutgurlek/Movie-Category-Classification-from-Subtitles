NIKOLAY MELNIK, survivor of the 1932/33
Famine | Potatoes, beets, cabbages.

4
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:42,940
Salted cabbages were taken
by the whole barrel.

5
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,776
All edible goods were taken away.

6
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,652
Everything!

7
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:05,855
VOLODIMIR SERGIYCHUK, Historian, University
of Kiev | When the food was taken away,

8
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,292
peasants were also forbidden
to seek it elsewhere.

9
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:14,698
To buy, exchange or earn.

10
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:42,972
BORISS SOKOLOV, Historian | They were dying.
And they were not allowed into the cities.

11
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:48,254
Special guard-squads prevented these
dying, starving people from

12
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,698
boarding the trains.
Many died right by the railways

13
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:55,090
leading to Kharkov, Kiev...

14
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:45,695
They entered a house and asked:
"where are your dead?"

15
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:49,859
There was only a half-dead
woman laying in the bed.

16
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:54,770
They said:
"Let's take her! She will die anyway."

17
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,211
"Why come after her tomorrow?"

18
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,208
She begged them: "Don't take me.
I am still alive! I want to live!"

19
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:13,177
MARIA ZAGUTS, survivor of the
1932/33 Famine | It was horrible!

20
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:20,536
They were all dumped into the grave.
The ground was moving.

21
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:38,215
This is a sacred place for me.

22
00:08:38,420 --> 00:08:44,052
Because it is the resting
place of the Famine victims,

23
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:49,539
including my close relatives,
my grandmother.

24
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:33,457
PIERRE RIGOULOT, Historian,
Institut d'histoire Sociale, Paris

25
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,495
We must create a new man.

26
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,810
And a new life form
should appear!

27

VLADIMIR BUKOVSKY
Soviet dissident

30
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,052
FRANÇOISE THOM, Professor
of Modern History, Sorbonne

31
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:36,536
You must all know half
a dozen of people at least,

32
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,895
who are of no use in this world.

33
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:41,170
Who are more trouble
than they are worth.

34
00:20:41,380 --> 00:20:44,338
Just put them there and say:
"Now will you be kind enough

35
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:47,737
to justify your existence?"

36
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:53,731
"If you can't justify your existence,

37
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:57,979
if you are not producing as much as
you consume or preferably more,

38
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:06,895
then clearly we cannot use our society
for the purpose of keeping you alive.

39
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,705
Because your life does not benefit us

40
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:13,255
and it can't be of very
much use to yourself.

41
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,811
Let's go and denounce them!

42
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:34,137
Then we can denounce even more
of them, the ones who are left.

43
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:38,612
Don't be afraid to do it.

44
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:04,299
ALEXANDER GURYANOV, "Memorial" society, Moscow | In the 1930s
the technology of murder and executions was introduced.

45
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:09,972
Every administrative region
had a designated area

46
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:13,610
where corpses were to be buried.

47
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,493
A person was taken down
a corridor to the "red corner"

48
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:34,330
There was the final ID check.

49
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:37,691
The victim had to identify himself.

50
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:40,255
Then he was led to that room.

51
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:45,012
When he entered, he was shot.

52
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:54,897
NICOLAS WERTH, co-author of
"The Black Book of Communism"

53
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:40,453
VLADIMIR KARPOV, former Soviet Colonel
Khrushchev asked to increase his quota!

54
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:44,539
He was allowed
to kill 7 or 8 thousand "enemies"

55
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,335
He asked:
"Please increase my quota to 17000."

56
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:06,338
MIKHAIL GORBACHEV, Soviet President | Stalin
was awash in blood! I saw the death sentences,

57
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,656
which he signed in packages.

58
00:28:08,860 --> 00:28:11,932
Together with Molotov,
Voroshilov, Kaganovich and Zhdanov.

59
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:15,252
They were the five most active.
Molotov would always add:

60
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,617
change "10 years" to "execution".
Packages!

61
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,136
NATALIA LEBEDEVA, Historian

62
00:29:10,171 --> 00:29:13,546
As a result, in 1937-1941,
11 million people were repressed.

63
00:29:13,946 --> 00:29:16,256
11 million!

64
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:19,179
Can you imagine

65
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:22,895
the scale of repression
against their own people?!

66
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:58,930
VLADIMIR BUKOVSKY
Soviet dissident

67
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:35,136
SERGEY SLUCH, Historian | According
to all norms of international law,

68
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:42,058
the decision of the Soviet
Government to invade Poland

69
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:45,531
was a clear act of aggression.

70
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:16,054
Red Army in 1939

71
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:46,970
NORMAN DAVIES, Historian,
Cambridge University

72
00:34:33,260 --> 00:34:38,971
Initially, Ribentropp's proposal
did not contain it.

73
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:43,689
However strange it may seem,

74
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:50,772
the initiator of this
secret protocol was Stalin.

75
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:59,735
But we denied it, because
it was so aggressive,

76
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:04,855
the Communist party
could not have signed it.

77
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:09,976
So, we denied it up to the last day!

78
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:28,576
ARI VATANEN, member of
the European Parliament

79
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:35,528
When Berlin made the decision
to stop using this base,

80
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:43,095
German Admiral Raeder

81
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:49,335
sent a letter to the Commander
of the Soviet Navy, Kuznetsov,

82
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:55,774
expressing deep gratitude for services
provided to the German Navy.

84
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:06,893
VIKTOR SUVOROV, former Soviet Secret Agent
A delegation of Gestapo came to the USSR

85
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:13,728
to learn how to build
concentration camps.

86
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:05,130
It is in German...

87
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:07,410
Beria's signature...

88
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,810
Translation from the German:

89
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,809
Reichsführer SS, Chief of
the Security Main Office.

90
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,976
Berlin, Nov. 3, 1938.

91
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,449
With this warrant, my representative

92
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:27,493
Standartenführer SS Mueller is given
the authority to sign an agreement

93
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:30,931
in Moscow on coordinated activities
between the NKVD and

94
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,173
the Security Main Office of Germany,
on which we put high expectations

95
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,211
related to strengthening the peace

96
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:42,329
and security between our countries.

97
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,415
Gruppenführer SS Heydrich.

98
00:49:51,820 --> 00:49:57,292
Attach to the main document.
Lavrenty Beria.

99
00:51:11,500 --> 00:51:20,374
A secret agreement was signed
between KGB and Gestapo.

100
00:51:20,580 --> 00:51:23,174
About collaboration.

101
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:29,013
They accused me of lying,
claiming that it was not true.

102
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:34,055
We could not have signed
such an agreement.

103
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:43,251
NATALIA LEBEDEVA, Historian | This contradiction is
amazing! While it is accepted that Stalin's regime

104
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:49,855
was criminal, exception is
made for the foreign affairs.

105
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:54,458
If a regime is criminal, then
it acts criminally in all areas,

106
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:56,930
including foreign affairs.

107
00:51:57,180 --> 00:51:59,648
This should be accepted once and for all!

108
00:52:33,180 --> 00:52:35,899
The NKVD will propose to
the Soviet Government

109
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,216
a program

110
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:41,776
to reduce the participation
of Jews in State bodies,

111
00:52:41,980 --> 00:52:45,211
and to prohibit Jews

112
00:52:45,420 --> 00:52:48,856
from the areas of culture
and education.

113
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,697
Chief of GUGB of the Commissariat
for Internal Affairs.

114
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:54,689
Beria.

115
00:52:54,900 --> 00:52:58,893
Representative of the Chief of the
Security Main Office of Germany,

116
00:52:59,020 --> 00:53:00,738
Mueller.

117
00:53:21,380 --> 00:53:24,292
This was a real war.

118
00:53:24,620 --> 00:53:28,579
A war against Jewish Fascism
within the country.

119
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:59,489
BORISS SOKOLOV, Historian | Because
being a Jew, Litvinov was not fit

120
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:05,252
for signing any agreement
with Germany.

121
00:54:13,260 --> 00:54:20,008
NORMAN DAVIES, Historian,
Cambridge University

122
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:54,689
Stalin's police, the GPU has fallen
to the level of the Nazi Gestapo.

123
00:57:21,580 --> 00:57:24,851
VLADIMIR BUKOVSKY
Soviet dissident

124
00:57:57,860 --> 00:58:01,137
Politburo CK VKPb
took the decision

125
00:58:01,260 --> 00:58:05,651
to shoot all prisoners of war
from these 3 camps.

126
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:42,412
Major Soprunenko who was
carrying out executions in Katyn

127
01:01:43,220 --> 01:01:50,379
VIKTOR SUVOROV, former Soviet Secret Agent
...was decorated with the Medal of Honor.

128
01:01:51,780 --> 01:01:55,853
But Serov,
the later chief of the KGB,

129
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:59,576
for the shooting of Polish officers,
he was awarded the order of Lenin,

130
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:02,658
the highest State decoration.

131
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:26,413
I swear to obey the orders

132
01:03:26,660 --> 01:03:32,849
of the Commander-in-Chief,
Adolph Hitler.

133
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:49,331
But if among us there will
appear provocateurs,

134
01:03:49,540 --> 01:03:52,418
we ourselves will deal
with them ruthlessly.

135
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:27,776
EMMA KORPA, GULAG survivor | And then
we dragged the sledges to the graveyard.

136
01:05:30,740 --> 01:05:41,259
When my son was dragged,
the guards were not on duty.

137
01:05:41,860 --> 01:05:47,545
Children were not
considered inmates,

138
01:05:47,580 --> 01:05:52,290
so they were buried in
a civilian graveyard.

139
01:05:54,260 --> 01:06:05,137
And when another child died,
I dragged him as well.

140
01:06:05,980 --> 01:06:14,697
Then I got a chance to visit my son's
grave for the last time...

143
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:31,292
RITA PAPINA, survivor of the Soviet terror
We went out. There was a big puddle of blood.

144
01:10:35,420 --> 01:10:44,658
We collected it in a glass jar.
Because it was our fathers blood.

145
01:10:50,340 --> 01:10:52,900
It is hard to speak about it.

146
01:10:54,740 --> 01:11:00,337
It is as if a scar was torn
and is bleeding again.

147

JANIS DZINTARS
Moscow, 2005

148
01:13:37,540 --> 01:13:41,130
VLADIMIR PUTIN, former KGB
Officer One needs to acknowledge,

149
01:13:41,340 --> 01:13:43,137
that the collapse of the Soviet Union

150
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:48,858
was the greatest geopolitical
catastrophe of the century.

151
01:13:51,860 --> 01:13:54,294
Nobody wants to admit

152
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:58,129
that one's ancestors
were simple criminals.

153

ANDRÉ BRIE, member of the
European Parliament, Germany

154
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:02,658
WOJCIECH ROSZKOWSKI, member of
the European Parliament, Poland

155
01:15:03,020 --> 01:15:06,695
There is this feeling of
inferiority, of national humiliation,

156
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,937
which was in Germany after WW1,

157
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:12,011
and we had it after the collapse
of the Soviet Union.

158
01:15:12,220 --> 01:15:17,248
It is fertile soil for
these new Nazis.

159
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:25,611
This is exactly what
led Germany to Fascism.

160
01:15:28,660 --> 01:15:33,609
Moscow, November 4.
"THE DAY OF NATIONAL UNITY"

161
01:15:35,980 --> 01:15:39,609
Since Putin came to power,

162
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:42,095
there has been

163
01:15:42,300 --> 01:15:45,895
a massive xenophobic
propaganda from above.

164
01:15:49,580 --> 01:15:54,176
And people have begun to feel
hatred toward foreigners,

165
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:57,372
to people of other languages,
other religions.

166
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:07,457
The Russian mass media is working
against Russia and its people,

167
01:16:07,660 --> 01:16:11,494
because it is in the hands
of the Jewish mafia.

168
01:16:52,340 --> 01:16:54,774
Pick it up.
And clean up after yourself.

169
01:16:59,260 --> 01:17:01,296
Do you speak Russian?

170
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,298
I am a deputy in the State Duma,
LDPR fraction. My name is

171
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:18,539
Nikolay Kuryanovich. I am a member
of the Security Committee.

172
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:22,892
I would like to greet
the national-patriots of Russia.

173
01:17:23,420 --> 01:17:25,490
Glory to Russia!

174
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:42,775
We were arrested by
the Russian National Socialists.

175
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:47,457
Glory to Russia!

176
01:18:58,940 --> 01:19:08,656
RADKO MLADIC, war criminal,
murderer of 8300 people

177
01:19:26,660 --> 01:19:28,616
Glory to Russia!

178
01:19:38,860 --> 01:19:43,536
Katyn.

179
01:19:44,820 --> 01:19:48,654
Lviv.

180
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:54,733
Vinnica.

181
01:19:55,260 --> 01:19:58,616
Tartu.
