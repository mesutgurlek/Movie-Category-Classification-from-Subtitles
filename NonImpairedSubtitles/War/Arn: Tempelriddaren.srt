00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,638
Based on Jan Guillou's story

3
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,516
The Holy Land 1177

4
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:02,745
War raged between Christian and Muslim
over the city that was sacred to them all:

5
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,800
Jerusalem.

6
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:10,631
Attacks and robberies made it dangerous
to travel in the inhospitable country.

7
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:06,500
In order to protect travellers and pilgrims

8
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,550
the Christian church sent its most
feared warriors: the Knights Templar.

9
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,420
For some, these knights were
God's blessed soldiers;

10
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:30,671
for others, they were 
the Devil's evil demons.

11
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:03,269
That's him.

12
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:06,930
The devil with the red cross: Al Ghouti.

13
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:15,638
Why is he helping us?

14
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,870
Al Ghouti.

15
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:42,760
Arn.

16
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Arn.

17
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:58,100
Many years earlier,
in the frozen north

18
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,715
the boy Arn Magnusson grew up.

19
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:07,637
His fate was to be significant
to many people's life and death.

20
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,598
Arn, where are you?

21
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,433
This isn't fun anymore.

22
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:22,391
Arn, come out now.

23
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,638
You are dead.

24
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,470
What are you doing out here alone?

25
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,260
This is no place for youngsters.

26
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,900
Arn was born on the farm Arnäs
in Västra Götaland,

27
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:08,632
a small divided kingdom in which three 
powerful clans fought over the crown.

28
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:15,068
Arn's parents, who belonged 
to the Folkunga clan,

29
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:19,074
had long managed to keep the peace
with their neighbours.

30
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,715
Have you seen the boys?
- No, Madame Sigrid.

31
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,805
Fetch Master Magnus. His brother is here.

32
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,860
I found these two north of the stream.
- Have you taken leave of your senses?

33
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,295
What were you thinking of?
How many times must I tell you?

34
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:57,555
Never alone in the forest - never!
- No.

35
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,716
So, inside with you both now.

36
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,074
Birger!
- Magnus!

37
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:10,877
What brings you here, brother?
- The King is on his way.

38
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,980
King Erik Jedvardsson rode round his land 
in order to strengthen his power

39
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:22,675
against his most dangerous enemy,
the Sverker clan.

40
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,756
Near Arnäs, he had built a church
that was now to be consecrated in his name.

41
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,220
I'm talking about consolidating our long
friendship and the church's holy realm.

42
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:42,998
Do I have your support, Folkunga people? 
Or must I leave this house your enemy?

43
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,085
Knut! Take that cursed bird 
of ill fortune outside!

44
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:53,060
Choosing the right side could be crucial.

45
00:06:53,160 --> 00:07:00,077
The king's son, Knut, knew from his father 
that those who fought for the crown

46
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,118
could win a great deal, but just as easily lose everything.

47
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,220
Are you also going to be king
when you grow up?

48
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:17,233
Father says so. He says
that God has decreed it.

49
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,980
He says that my son will be king.

50
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,540
And my grandson,
and my great grandson...

51
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:28,839
- ...and your great great great 
great great grandson.

52
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,990
Can I hold him?

53
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,620
Sorry.

54
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,271
It's doesn't matter.
He always comes back.

55
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:49,900
The Folkunga clan decided to
support King Erik Jedvardsson

56
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:52,559
in his consecration of the church.

57
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,793
A house of God, but 
built on Sverker land.

58
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,349
Sverkers - in the forest.

59
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,540
How dare you - before God's house?

60
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
No.

61
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,154
Listen to me, Folkungar.

62
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,740
Right now there is only one rightful king
in Västra Götaland.

63
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:27,435
And I am he: Karl Sverkersson.

64
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,800
Who is he?

65
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,869
Is that his son?

66
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,799
No, he is with me.

67
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:19,705
Knut is not safe here. I will take him
to friends in Norway.

68
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,315
The sword had been unsheathed

69
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:35,514
and the people of Västra Götaland turned, 
trembling, to prayer to God,

70
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,140
for only he could know
what the future would bring

71
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,725
and who would be friend or foe.

72
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:48,278
At Arnäs, they prepared for uncertain times,

73
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:55,471
and Arn would soon find out what
God had in store for him and his family.

74
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:09,275
Will there be war now?
- No, you don't have to worry

75
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,152
We have a new king, that's all.

76
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:20,280
That's the way it is.

77
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,519
Where is Knut?

78
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,520
He is in Norway.

79
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,908
But isn't Knut going to be king?

80
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:40,605
With God's help, they'll retake the throne. 
So we have to be patient.

81
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,751
No, Ingmar. They go to the forge.

82
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,120
Arn! Come!

83
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,037
Look!
- It's Knut's bird.

84
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:18,765
No, Arn! You're not allowed up there.

85
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,314
You are not allowed!

86
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,596
Arn!

87
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,752
Mother. Mother!

88
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:09,630
Mother, come!

89
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,270
Arn, can you hear me?

90
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,230
What happened?
- I said that he shouldn't go up there.

91
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,637
We must not give up hope, Magnus.

92
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,600
Come.

93
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,790
Dear God,

94
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:06,559
give Arn back his life.

95
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,010
If you let him live,

96
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,838
we promise to repay it.

97
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:27,220
We promise that we shall give him
to your holy work.

98
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,198
We give you our promise, God.

99
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,837
He will be your servant on earth.

100
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,600
God,

101
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,753
we give you our promise.

102
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,310
God, we give you our promise.

103
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,318
We give you our promise.

104
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,120
Magnus.

105
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:09,354
Our prayers have been heard.

106
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:20,391
Listen here. I have made up my mind.
- No, you can't mean it.

107
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,028
He's just a child.

108
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:25,880
We promised, Magnus

109
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:32,672
No, Sigrid. I will not send 
my boy to a monastery.

110
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:37,380
Do you think I want this?.
- You can't mean it.

111
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,278
I have put it off, doubted.

112
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,260
I can't close my eyes to my sin anymore.
- He's just a child.

113
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:48,193
We promised, Magnus.

114
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:55,280
We promised God that, if he let Arn live, 
we would give him to His holy work.

115
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,394
God has a purpose for Arn.

116
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:08,010
For something so great, we 
should not stand in the way.

117
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,637
It is God's punishment, Magnus. We have failed him.

118
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,673
This is how He reminds us.

119
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,156
We must keep our promise.

120
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,805
I will take him to Varnhems monastery.

121
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,110
Pater Henri.

122
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,540
Pater...

123
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,111
I need your help.
- What is it, my daughter?

124
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:02,835
[In English] We have an extra blanket 
for him if he gets cold, do we?

125
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,720
Where is mother?

126
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,855
[English] We'll do all we can for her.

127
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,120
[English] The boy.

128
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:42,860
Brother Lucien has examined the mother.

129
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,750
The sores on her face are quite consistent 
with swine fever. That we can cure.

130
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:50,980
Her arm... it's blood poisoning.

131
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:56,156
There's only one cure for that.
- It has to be... removed?

132
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,794
The mother refuses.

133
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:04,752
She says it is the will of God.

134
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:15,590
She and her husband promised the child 
to God. The promise is a sacred trust.

135
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,231
We cannot oppose the will of God.

136
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:24,315
But I am reluctant to raise
a child to become a monk.

137
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,999
To become one of us must be a free choice.

138
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:49,975
Father Henri has promised that 
you can stay here.

139
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,354
It is God's will, Arn.

140
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,909
Do you understand that?

141
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:03,277
Will you stay here too, mother?

142
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:16,357
Be obedient, and do as you are told.

143
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,715
There you have it.

144
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,680
Do you promise me that?

145
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,340
[French] Do you want to try?

146
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,560
Want to try? Hmmm?

147
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,540
OK?

148
00:24:36,037 --> 00:24:38,023
Here...

149
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,829
[English] Hold it tight.

150
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:45,197
And now, aim...

151
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:50,480
and now try to hit the target.

152
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,920
Very good!

153
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,758
Good. Again.
Good. Again.

154
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,234
Very good! Hup! 
Hey look!

155
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:10,370
I told you, always in my eyes.

156
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,280
Vocat.
- Vocat.

157
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,829
Vocamus.
- Vocamus.

158
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,389
Scribo.
- Scribo.

159
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:22,996
Scribis.
- Scribis.

160
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,120
Arn.

161
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:55,140
Arn, wake up.

162
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,240
Come.

163
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,340
(Mutters the last rites)

164
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,639
'Thou hast ravaged my heart, my sister, my spouse;

165
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:37,100
Thou hast ravaged my heart
with one of thine eyes,

166
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,556
with one chain of thy neck.

167
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:47,380
The Song of Solomon is the most beautiful 
text about love ever written.

168
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,074
You'll understand that one day.

169
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,835
But how can you win someone's heart?

170
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,872
It is figuratively meant, Arn.

171
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:10,869
'Alloy est omnis
scientiae fundamentum '.

172
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,228
Write it.

173
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:19,714
[English] 'To read is the foundation of all knowledge'.

174
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,320
What?

175
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:41,713
[English] In which hand does it feel most comfortable?

176
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,870
Both.

177
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:52,160
Again.

178
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,015
You seem to be training him to be a warrior.

179
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:14,035
Is that entirely wise?

180
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:21,513
I am merely strengthening the skills 
that God has already given him.

181
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:33,077
[English] You have a new friend. Look.

182
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,993
What a beautiful horse!

183
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,038
What kind of horse is that?

184
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:50,477
Well, he belongs to the noblest, the fastest,
the most resilient breed there is.

185
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,838
They are war horses.
- Where is he from?

186
00:29:57,840 --> 00:29:59,840
The Holy Land.

187
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:24,316
Can you speak to him?
- I can speak to desert horses.

188
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,269
I think he likes you.

189
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,440
Tell him that I like him too.

190
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,996
What's his name?

191
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:43,713
Chamsiin.
- Chamsiin.

192
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:46,720
It means "Desert Wind".

193
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,159
D'you want to ride him?

194
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:01,519
Good. Can you feel the strength of the horse?

195
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,789
Good!

196
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:11,630
Help me. I don't want to!
- Where is she?

197
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:14,394
There, Gunnar - look.
- I pray you, help me.

198
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:17,450
Come, Gunnar, come!
- I do not want him.

199
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:20,358
Sinner!
- There she is!

200
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:22,560
Bride abduction!

201
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:30,639
No, no! Let go of me!

202
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,718
You thought you could take my bride?
- Leave him be!

203
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,839
He's just as innocent as you, 
running away from the wedding.

204
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:50,120
Do what you must, brother.

205
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,748
God, bear in mind...

206
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:55,753
it's only a boy monk.

207
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,916
Take it, boy.

208
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:09,080
Take it.

209
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,955
Take it up.

210
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:27,080
Take it, then.

211
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:18,110
[English] Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

212
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,839
I have committed the gravest of sins.

213
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,032
I've killed two men.

214
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:36,432
That is the end of your confession,
my son?

215
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:42,359
All thy sins I thee forgive.
Ego te absolvo.

216
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:46,513
In the name of the Father, and of 
the Son and of the Holy Ghost.

217
00:34:47,640 --> 00:34:51,155
I do not understand.
- Sit.

218
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,460
You killed those men in self-defence.
They were sinners trying to

219
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:05,780
force that poor girl to marry against her will.
It may not have been a miracle,

220
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,031
as that simple-minded priest said,

221
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:14,673
but who, if not God, was it
that put them in your way?

222
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:23,156
Arn, it was your mother's will,

223
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,980
and God's, that you be raised here in this monastery;

224
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,820
well, now you are grown up, and 
you must do the Lord's calling.

225
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:35,950
Broder Guilbert and I have discussed this,
and we have reached a decision.

226
00:35:38,120 --> 00:35:41,430
The time has come for you to go home, Arn.

227
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:45,354
You must go back to your family.

228
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,595
'In hoc signo vinces.'

229
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:53,230
'In this sign thou shalt conquer'.

230
00:35:56,880 --> 00:36:01,317
Before I came here,
to this peaceful monastery,

231
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:04,677
I served another order:

232
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,595
God's Holy Army, the Knights Templar.

233
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:17,233
For 12 years, I fought with this sword
in the Holy Land.

234
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,998
With this sword no-one has ever defeated me.

235
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:31,580
You may never draw it in anger
or use it for your own gain.

236
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:34,877
It has to serve God's good cause.

237
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,710
Cecilia.

238
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,460
You let your animals graze my land?
Don't you know where the boundaries are?

239
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,100
Yes, I know where they go.
- It's not your land.

240
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:37,557
Have you no honour in your body? 
You stand there and lie to my face?

241
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:41,508
That land has always belonged to the Folkunga clan.

242
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:48,356
Yeah, there are more than just me that can confirm it.
- Then we shall see what the council has to say.

243
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,154
See you, liar.

244
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:01,118
And who are you?

245
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,630
Eskil.

246
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,480
Father.

247
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,440
Arn.

248
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,040
Well I'll be...

249
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,393
I didn't recognise you.

250
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:53,759
I thought I had lost you
to the monks.

251
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,914
It's good to have you back.

252
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:10,231
"Then fetch the steer instead," she said.
- To him?

253
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,670
Arn, my boy. Stand up.

254
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:20,035
You are Folkunga now.
Bear it it with pride.

255
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,390
Who was the man that was here?

256
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:33,995
Emund Ulvbane.
- You know the snake...

257
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,913
that shot King Erik with an arrow?

258
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:42,585
Now, he claims that we have 
taken land that belongs to him.

259
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:46,955
We'll sort it all out at the council.
Axevalla Council.

260
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,551
There is much that is new to you now.

261
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:30,913
Magnus.
- Brose.

262
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:37,556
Arn. I am happy that you 
have returned to Arnäs.

263
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:45,508
You haven't changed, Brose.
- You've had a few years in the monks' cells.

264
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,796
Have you learned to read?

265
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:52,112
Hmmmm, so you can read now.

266
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,300
Is Knut here, too?
-No, no. He is still in Norway. It's best that way.

267
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:00,740
He knows that time is on his side.

268
00:42:00,840 --> 00:42:04,753
When it comes to the dispute with Ulvbane,
then we shall have to give him silver.

269
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:08,700
Although we have truth on our side,
we have to buy time.

270
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:11,435
I thought to propose a settlement.

271
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:15,100
What worries me is that Ulvbane 
is so close to the Sverker clan.

272
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,637
A troubled king is an erratic king.

273
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,076
We are gathered here in Axevalla,

274
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,435
to hold Council.

275
00:42:48,600 --> 00:42:53,037
We come in peace, and we go in peace.

276
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:58,150
Those who violate the peace of Council,
shall be seen as a villain.

277
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,710
This council is now open.

278
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:17,038
The next issue is the land dispute between
Magnus Folkesson and Emund Ulvbane.

279
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,672
As I have understood it,
Magnus Folkesson is prepared to settle.

280
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:24,580
That is correct.

281
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:30,198
I am prepared to buy out Emund Ulvbane
for thirty pieces of silver.

282
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,440
That is more than any man can demand,

283
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:39,912
for peace between  neighbours
is worth more than silver.

284
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:54,437
This settlement is satisfactory?

285
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,478
As the Council has judged,

286
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:06,791
so must I accept.

287
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:19,340
But it is troublesome that silver
takes precedence over honour and justice.

288
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:25,035
It troubles me to have to settle
with a man without honour.

289
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:28,158
You, Magnus Folkesson,

290
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:31,954
you are no man.

291
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:35,100
And your sons are no better.

292
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,990
Two sons of a bitch, one a nun
and the other a beer barrel.

293
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:52,730
Sverkersson has planned this, and words of conflict
have been whispered in Ulvbanes ear more than once.

294
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:57,100
He knew exactly what to say, word for word.
Sverkersson wants to weaken us.

295
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,540
He knows that Knut might come back from Norway
and fears that he will take the crown with our help.

296
00:45:01,640 --> 00:45:06,900
I wish there were a loophole,
but given the insults between you,

297
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:09,958
the law demands a duel.

298
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:13,237
Is there no other way?

299
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:23,039
Surely there must be another way.
- I shall meet him tomorrow.

300
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,188
May God help me.

301
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,439
Don't despair,

302
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:11,073
I am not buried yet.

303
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,725
Let the combatants come forward.

304
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,570
It's too late.
He has accepted the challenge.

305
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:54,189
Shall I fight a nun?

306
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:06,948
I didn't think your father was such a weakling.

307
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,076
Kill the Sverker.
- Chop him up him, Arn.

308
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,152
Finish him.

309
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:26,112
Kill! Kill!

310
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,629
Welcome, Magnus.

311
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,740
News of Axevalla precedes you.

312
00:50:23,840 --> 00:50:26,900
Thank you for letting us rest here tonight.

313
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:32,233
I see we have a new face here.
- Yes, it is Arn.

314
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:38,749
Arn! The last time I saw you, you were a toddler.
Now it's you everyone is talking about.

315
00:50:39,480 --> 00:50:42,472
You must be a proud father, Magnus.

316
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:34,553
You think I'm ugly?
- No.

317
00:53:05,480 --> 00:53:09,519
Give my regards to mother.
- Don't be sad, Katarina.

318
00:53:10,600 --> 00:53:13,910
Soon, it will be my turn again.

319
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:42,820
Welcome home, Cecilia.
- Thank you.

320
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:46,300
How was Katarina?
She was so sad when she left for the abbey.

321
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,916
That's the way it always is
when it is her turn to be there.

322
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:55,755
I promised that we would visit her.
- That can be arranged.

323
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:56,558
Cecilia.
- Yes, mother.

324
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:34,070
Arn. Algot Pålsson is here.
He has his daughter with him.

325
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:41,029
It isn't Katarina.
It's Cecilia.

326
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,313
Welcome, Algot. 
What brings you here?

327
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:50,870
We were in these parts, so...

328
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:58,588
I just wanted to see what it was like.

329
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:02,395
It's been a long time since I was here.

330
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,520
Father does not like when I ride alone,

331
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:20,438
that's why we have the groom for company.

332
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:24,391
You have met my sister?
- What?

333
00:56:24,560 --> 00:56:27,711
Katarina. You've met her, haven't you?

334
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,740
Katarina, yes.

335
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:36,770
So what did you think of her?
- You are not very alike. I mean...

336
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:40,589
You are quite different.
- You think so?

337
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,351
What a beautiful horse you have.

338
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:52,320
Come.

339
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,749
Catch me if you can.

340
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,429
We nealry lost him.
- Miss Cecilia?

341
00:57:41,560 --> 00:57:44,870
Meet me here at dusk.

342
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:08,000
Cecilia?

343
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,635
Come now.

344
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,040
Cecilia!

345
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:03,360
Arn...

346
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:15,075
Stop!

347
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:30,710
"Thou hast ra...

348
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,320
What did you say?

349
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:37,189
What did you say?

350
00:59:39,720 --> 00:59:45,113
"Thou hast ravanged my heart,
my sister, my bride.

351
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:53,118
Thou hast ravanged my heart
with one of thine eyes."

352
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,060
I think you have ravaged my...

353
01:00:04,160 --> 01:00:06,674
Arn Magnusson.

354
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,468
Don't you greet people?

355
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,989
Do we know each other?

356
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:10,233
It was my jackdaw's fault
that you ended up in the monastery.

357
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,122
