1
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,711
Today's review will be the final
operation of training period two.

2
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,996
Instructions for period three
will be issued tomorrow.

3
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:20,677
Study them. Make your plans.
Stand by for flight quarters.

4
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,877
- First Division ready for flight.
- Second Division ready for flight.

5
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,794
You boys are getting so efficient
you scare me. Come on, they're waiting.

6
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,992
- What course did you get to steer on?
- Course 273 for 15 minutes.

7
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,391
- That's about what I got.
- From this point, we can circle...

8
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,436
Hey, sit down. I can't see the board.

9
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,475
Bombing pilots, attention.

10
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,951
Rendezvous over the carrier
at 2000 feet.

11
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,032
Gold braid's on the field ashore.
Fly past in mass formation.

12
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,034
Then make a dive-bombing attack.
And don't forget to take your shore legs.

13
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,509
Honolulu, here we come!

14
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,956
All right, all right. Relax and stand by,
you bunch of ground lovers.

15
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,759
- Taking care of my gear, Tom?
- We'll move it ashore.

16
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,798
- Thanks.
- Not at all. I'll be glad to get rid of you.

17
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,113
- Oh, have you got a cigarette?
- Yeah.

18
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:21,996
- Say, what is this? Gold?
- Sure. We've got a friend at Fort Knox.

19
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,277
- You guys didn't buy these on Navy pay.
- We found them under a rock.

20
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,637
You ought to wear specs to go
with them, or carry a cane.

21
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,392
These certainly make an impression.

22
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:33,273
Only thing I own that'd make me
welcome in a pawnshop.

23
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,277
They sent them
because Joe rumbled...

24
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,149
...with a governor's wife in Cleveland.
- That probably had a lot to do with it.

25
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,074
With the boys running National Air
Races, thought we'd do better stunts.

26
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,678
Things will be awful tough on Joe
if black cats sprout wings.

27
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:49,877
National Air Races, five times a day
scraping noses on the ground.

28
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,393
It was worth 18 karats.

29
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:54,438
Oh, yeah, but I got the best deal
out of Cleveland.

30
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,239
- 5 feet 2, blue eyes.
- There he goes again.

31
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,915
- Wait till he's washed a million didies.
- And walked with junior's gas pains.

32
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,877
He'll wish he'd taken a cigarette case.

33
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,789
Swede, how'd you get glamour dust in
your eyes? Pilot's a fool to take a wife.

34
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,231
Hazel's broad-minded. She's letting me
off once a week after marriage.

35
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,670
Well, that's better than being
in a penitentiary.

36
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:17,072
I wish you transferred to San Diego with
us instead of here, after the honeymoon.

37
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:19,800
Yeah, it's a crime to break up
the three top hats.

38
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,916
Did a lot of loops together
here and there.

39
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,799
Boy, you're gonna miss those times.
So are we.

40
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,475
I'll have a bride to take care of.
You guys will be playing tag with cadets.

41
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,232
I'll play tag.

42
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,393
Pilots, man your planes.
Pilots, man your planes.

43
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,595
<i>Stand by to start engines.</i>

44
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,475
<i>Stand clear of propellers.</i>

45
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,119
She's sweet as sugar, commander.

46
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,317
Doctor, there's something
sort of morbid about our jobs.

47
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:33,155
Here we sit, day after day,
like buzzards on a rail fence.

48
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,197
Yeah, I guess you're right, Lucky.

49
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,591
We sort of symbolize the uncertainty
of life for those pilots.

50
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:42,355
- No wonder they don't love us.
- Oh, I don't mind them, sir. It's my wife.

51
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,034
She says I have to stop
smelling of iodoform.

52
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,792
Did you ever have complaints on it?

53
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,997
Did I? Only about eight years.
Harvard, Hopkins, Cambridge.

54
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,475
The girls all used to call me
"The lodoform Kid."

55
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,349
- Generally, they called me, "Stinky."
- How did you manage to get rid of it?

56
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,112
I didn't. They just got used to it.

57
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:00,430
Killed a lot of romances for me, Lucky.

58
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,478
I should have been smart like you,
lieutenant, stayed single.

59
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:06,200
Especially if I'd known
I was coming to Honolulu.

60
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,920
Why, that's fine talk
when you're a new bridegroom.

61
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,310
Three weeks and I got marriage
up to here.

62
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,833
Yeah?

63
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,912
Three more and you'll have it
up to here.

64
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,555
Those planes do something to you,
don't they?

65
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,437
Almost as good as the Army.

66
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,599
Look at that formation.

67
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:51,799
Bombing six, stand by to peel off.

68
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:39,598
- It's Swede.
- Blackout again.

69
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:20,196
- You got a cigarette?
- Sure.

70
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:25,709
I can't move. I can't feel anything.

71
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,639
How did I get...?

72
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,357
Here.

73
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,755
That's good.

74
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,952
What happened, chum?
Did you misjudge your altitude?

75
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,356
It was a dive.

76
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,512
I couldn't pull up.

77
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,350
Blacked out.

78
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:03,113
Why don't you doctors
do something about that.

79
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,268
Yeah, why don't we. Here.

80
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:11,352
Here's the pressure
on the spine right here.

81
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,479
That can only be relieved
by an immediate operation.

82
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,234
Well, he's pretty weak
from shock and loss of blood.

83
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,914
There's a chance if we wait for him
to regain strength.

84
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:25,473
Wait? Of course, it's your responsibility,
but did a case ever improve by waiting?

85
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:30,031
He'll never regain consciousness unless
we go in now. I wish I wasn't so certain.

86
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,279
- Who's caring for Larson?
- Commander Martin, Lieutenant Lee.

87
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,270
- You saw him. He's still alive?
- He was, yes, sir.

88
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,356
I'm Larson's squadron commander.
How is he?

89
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:52,431
A concussion, possibly skull fracture.

90
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:56,718
Also, the x-rays showed a dislocated
vertebra pressing on the spinal cord here.

91
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,110
It's a problem of whether
to operate now or wait.

92
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,999
I don't wanna be insistent,
but we're wasting valuable time.

93
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,799
- What'll you do for him?
- Does he have family in Honolulu?

94
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,234
- No.
- We're his friends.

95
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,038
We haven't time to worry about that.

96
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:11,915
Allison's just published a complete
record of over 300 cases of cord injury.

97
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:14,469
Each single case that recovered
was operated at once.

98
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,677
Every minute the pressure was unrelieved
lessened the chances of recovery.

99
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,594
- What more can I say?
- Perhaps you're right. Come along.

100
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,830
Sponge. Sponge.

101
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,394
Scalpel.

102
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,712
Retractor.

103
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:47,472
Breathing has stopped.
Pulse is getting very weak.

104
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,917
- Sticky, isn't it?
- Yeah.

105
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,716
That much injury,
there never was a chance.

106
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:44,519
No. None whatever.

107
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,588
I'm sorry, but your friend
just died on the table.

108
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:11,914
Accident cases are always uncertain.

109
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:16,631
You can never be quite sure of
the extent of shock or internal injuries.

110
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,759
Well, I'm sorry.

111
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:28,156
You were certain enough a while ago.

112
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:31,596
Maybe it would have been better to wait,
as the commander said.

113
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:35,435
No, it wouldn't have made
any difference.

114
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,876
His spinal cord was
almost completely severed.

115
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,474
He said he lost consciousness
pulling out of the dive.

116
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,993
We think he lost it in there.

117
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,035
Everything was done
that could have been done.

118
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,988
I appreciate your feelings, but not your
criticism. It has no sound medical basis.

119
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,676
Are you an example
of sound medical basis?

120
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:14,512
I sent Hazel a cable and a letter.

121
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,148
She'll be going through
the ringer for a while.

122
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,112
Do you think we ought to see her?

123
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,430
No, it would just get her
all stirred up again.

124
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,240
- Linda!
- Doug.

125
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,709
Pal! What are you doing here
in Honolulu?

126
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,871
Of all the nice people.
How nice to see you.

127
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,634
- It's good to see you too.
- Gosh, you look wonderful.

128
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,711
- Thanks.
- Listen...

129
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,471
Come over here.
I want to talk to you.

130
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,029
How many times have I told you
to stop following me?

131
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,318
Who said I was following you around?

132
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,789
I'm with friends and got bored
and went for a walk.

133
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,356
Of course, I was hoping I might run...

134
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:59,556
Okay. I'm following you around.

135
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,153
But in a very refined way.

136
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,031
Darling, why do you waste your time
on me? You're much too nice for me.

137
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,077
- Am I?
- Sure, you are.

138
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,437
I've told you, as far as I'm concerned,
a woman is like an elephant.

139
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:13,478
I like to look at them,
but I don't want to own one. Come on.

140
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,073
- Hey, Peter, a table for two.
- Over there.

141
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:25,838
Now, two of those tall green horrors
of yours.

142
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,399
That will kill us or cure us.

143
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,679
You're a double-dyed, no-good,
cold-hearted wretch, Douglas.

144
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,674
Somehow, I find you very entertaining.

145
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,831
What? Oh, thanks.

146
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,629
Well, how is good old Jack
back there in Washington?

147
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,075
His name is Charlie,
and he lives in Baltimore.

148
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:48,030
Yeah, old Charlie, that's what I said.
Well, how is he? Swell guy.

149
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,270
I always used to get so jealous of him.

150
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,956
Shall I phone and tell him I've caught the
mumps or something and stay a while?

151
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,399
Yeah, sure. Do that.

152
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,957
Did you hear what I said?
I'm offering to stay another week.

153
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:04,953
What? Oh, another week.
Why, darling, that will be wonderful.

154
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,998
I hope you can make it.
Look, will you excuse me just a moment?

155
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:09,513
I must talk to these fellas.

156
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,592
Why do I keep tossing myself at you?
Why am I such a chump?

157
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:16,150
Darling, you're not a chump.
I'll be right back.

158
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:22,437
Say, could I buy you fellas a drink?

159
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,872
No, thanks.

160
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,035
I just... Oh, thanks, I'll have it here.

161
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,229
I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry
for sounding off that way this morning.

162
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,311
I guess we're all wound up
a bit too tight.

163
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,879
Yeah.

164
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,958
You know, this blackout in dive-bombing
is a very interesting medical subject.

165
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,439
I just read a report on it.

166
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:51,956
Seems those German Stuka pilots
have been hit hard.

167
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,151
You find a way to make
pullouts easier?

168
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,955
Sure. Cut down your diving speed with
flaps and just hang up there in the air.

169
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,509
Then you're a pushover
for antiaircraft fire.

170
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:01,999
Yeah, it's tough, all right.

171
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,197
But I still think with proper research,
we'll lick those problems.

172
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,148
It's a cinch. The new German bombers
are coming in at about 38,000 feet.

173
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,915
All RAF fighters have to do is top
that by a few thousand feet to attack.

174
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,514
Trouble is, when you're that high,
you're unconscious.

175
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,875
Say, that brings up
another interesting problem.

176
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,874
Dr. Collins has new work on high-altitude
sickness. What's it doing to your outfit?

177
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:24,875
Three men in the sickbay,
and one funeral.

178
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:28,032
We don't know whether that last one
was high-altitude sickness...

179
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,395
...blackout or just too much
smart surgery.

180
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,878
It must be pretty uncomfortable
up at 30,000 feet, isn't it?

181
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:38,672
Not at all, doc, it's great sport.

182
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:41,513
Freeze, get nutty from no oxygen,
crash, break your neck.

183
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,079
You ought to try it some time.

184
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,075
Thanks. Well, just thought we might
learn something from each other.

185
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,878
I've learned one thing from you.

186
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,679
If you pill rollers flew more,
you might find how to help.

187
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:55,308
- I agree with you.
- How many hops you made this week?

188
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:58,517
Me? None. I'm not a flight surgeon,
just a routine doctor.

189
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,154
Then keep your amateur flying talk
to yourself, doc...

190
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,231
...till you get your feet off the ground.

191
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,710
Pilots like Swede die because
so-called experts can't keep them alive.

192
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:11,396
- You don't even fly, and still you got...
- Wait a minute. Listen, I'm on your side.

193
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,996
I agree. Medical science is far too much
in the dark about these things.

194
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:18,829
Then give the flight surgeons a hand.
Maybe all they need is a genius like you.

195
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,155
Wouldn't it be funny
if that's what they did need?

196
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:26,029
lt'd be more than funny.
It'd be a first-class, full-grown miracle.

197
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:28,111
Give me a check.

198
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:46,679
Remember me?
Linda, the girl you met out there.

199
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:48,671
I'm sorry for staying away so long.

200
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,229
I didn't mean to.
We got on some important subjects.

201
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,473
So I surmised. I also surmise I'm not
one of them, as far as you're concerned.

202
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,358
- Don't be mad.
- Oh, I'm not mad.

203
00:22:57,560 --> 00:23:00,358
I don't mind anything sweet.
That's my chief attraction.

204
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:03,353
- I know.
- We'll have a date if you can remember.

205
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:06,233
- Fine.
- And I decided not to stay for a while.

206
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,118
Good night.

207
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,757
Too much sugar in the bloodstream.

208
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:05,352
Torpedo Squadron 6 from tower.
Wind northwest. Take off when ready.

209
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,229
Thirty years ago, the Navy had
one airplane and two pilots.

210
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,996
Only 20 years ago, a Naval aviator
was the first man to fly the Atlantic.

211
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,032
In those few years, the men who learned
to fly here really built Naval aviation.

212
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,919
And now you're here
to learn to fly and to fight...

213
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,071
...become a part of that heritage.

214
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,276
Soon you'll be looking back
and realizing...

215
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:01,955
...that each of you has shared
in making history as it is made today.

216
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,997
All right. March to ground school.

217
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,714
Attention. Left face.

218
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,110
Forward, march.

219
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:35,349
I know you're trying. Everybody's trying.
In fact, the Navy is famous for trying.

220
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:39,399
But if small planes make you dizzy,
you'd better go back to Philadelphia.

221
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,199
We won't order another transfer
to teach you to fly.

222
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:43,952
- Now, you think it over.
- Yes, sir.

223
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,237
- He's in a bad mood this morning.
- He's in a very good mood for him.

224
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,119
- That's all.
- Yes, sir.

225
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,710
Any of you guys can't find a room,
I'll share my doghouse with you.

226
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:00,031
- You're next, sir.
- Thanks.

227
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,509
- You better stand away from that door.
- Why, sir?

228
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:05,353
I don't want you to get hurt
when I get thrown through it.

229
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,474
- Morning, sir.
- Morning.

230
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,473
Lieutenant Lee, reporting
for flight-surgeon instruction.

231
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:14,757
- Welcome to San Diego, doctor.
- Thank you, sir.

232
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:16,911
- Bachelor, eh?
- Oh, yes, sir.

233
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:20,675
Good. Married officers always want
to go home for lunch.

234
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:25,832
- You did Naval Air Station, Pearl Harbor.
- Right, sir. Pretty much a wasted year.

235
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:30,198
But now I've got some ideas for research
on blackout and high-altitude sickness.

236
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,476
Ideas for research are good
to have around.

237
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:35,395
We've even got a couple here
ourselves, lieutenant.

238
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:38,315
Oh. Well, that's very gratifying, sir.

239
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:46,955
- Analysis of student rejections.
- Thanks. I'll read it later.

240
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,272
Oh. Lieutenant Commander Rogers,
in charge of research...

241
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,310
...Lieutenant Lee,
student flight surgeon.

242
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,799
- How do you do, sir?
- Hello.

243
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,599
Lee tells me he's got ideas for research
along your line.

244
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:01,149
- Look after him, will you?
- Right, sir.

245
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:03,151
Come along.

246
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,760
What's your school?
The diploma mill of Hoosier State?

247
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,512
No. Harvard, Hopkins, Cambridge.

248
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,069
- I can read and write.
- Very impressive.

249
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,913
How'd you offer the Navy so much
for so little in return?

250
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:26,277
- I'm just naturally generous.
- Not to mention your devastating wit.

251
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,189
Now I'd appreciate it
if you'd answer my question.

252
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:32,079
I joined the Navy because it offered
an active medical life.

253
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,151
Then I got interested
in aviation medicine.

254
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,198
I applied for the flight surgeon's course,
and here I am.

255
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,148
- I trust that meets your approval, sir?
- Temporarily, it does.

256
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,828
Go to bachelor quarters
and report at 8 a.m. tomorrow.

257
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,355
- When do I start flying?
- Just leave that to us.

258
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,717
- We'll see you get lots of nice little rides.
- Well, thanks.

259
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:53,270
And don't think I don't appreciate
the one I've just been having.

260
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,155
Put her down and keep her down.

261
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:32,268
Hey, what do you think you're flying,
a kangaroo?

262
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,793
That's tough luck. You missed them.
Now, put her down.

263
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:17,555
- What kind of a landing do you call that?
- I'm sorry, sir. I got confused.

264
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,074
Every time I take you doctors upstairs,
you pat me in the face with a spade.

265
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,593
What have you got against me?

266
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,638
Nothing. The ground's closer
than I thought, that's all.

267
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,109
Slim, you'd never make a flier
in a thousand years.

268
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:31,874
Doctors are dodoes by nature,
all of them.

269
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,196
- One thing I want to thank you for.
- What, sir?

270
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,920
You're the last grasshopper
in this plague of surgeons.

271
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,672
It's an even break to live longer.

272
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,313
- That's all.
- Yes, sir.

273
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:48,510
- Hello.
- Hi.

274
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:51,478
Sorry, but here's another grasshopper.

275
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:56,917
Well, well. What have I done
to deserve this honor?

276
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:59,071
You took the words
right out of my mouth.

277
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:00,878
Tired of Honolulu?
Run out of women?

278
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:04,032
No, no. Things just got a little dull
after you left.

279
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,633
Well, when do I start flying?

280
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:09,031
I can't imagine a nicer job than teaching
you myself, but I'm too busy.

281
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:10,633
That's a tough break for me.

282
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:13,758
We'll try to find an instructor
worthy of your talents.

283
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,592
Hey, Tim.

284
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,318
- How are you, lieutenant?
- I was all right until now.

285
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,995
Tim, the doctor here wants a pair
of wings so he can visit his ex-patients.

286
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,071
See if you can jam his head
into a cockpit.

287
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,878
Well, I'd be delighted.

288
00:30:31,040 --> 00:30:33,634
Get your flight equipment on
and report to plane 17.

289
00:30:33,800 --> 00:30:36,234
- Don't forget your parachute.
- Thank you, gentlemen.

290
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:40,279
I know I can expect the very best
of instruction at your hands.

291
00:30:45,880 --> 00:30:49,395
This is a profanity strainer.
I talk, but you can't talk back.

292
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,596
Very clever.
No home should be without one.

293
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,194
All right. Come on. Get aboard.

294
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,037
You're all set?

295
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,517
All right, you take it.

296
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,431
Fly straight ahead.

297
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,034
Keep your nose on the horizon.
Wings level.

298
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,599
All right. Don't pay any attention to me.

299
00:32:00,760 --> 00:32:03,194
I'm just talking through this thing
for practice.

300
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,639
I said, handle the controls gently,
Dr. Lee.

301
00:32:08,560 --> 00:32:10,755
A Harvard man should know
how to be gentle.

302
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:30,310
I've checked a lot of students
in my time, but you're about the worst.

303
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:33,830
If we weren't officers and gentlemen,
I'd say you stink.

304
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:38,308
Now, to make a quick recovery,
put that stick forward. Now, try it again.

305
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:49,437
Anytime.

306
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,877
Hey, what's the idea?
Flip her over.

307
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:25,439
Let go of the stick!

308
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:53,468
Are you trying to fly
or combine suicide with murder?

309
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,631
Maybe that wouldn't be
such a bad idea.

310
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:57,916
You told me to put the stick forward,
so I did.

311
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,675
Sure, right through the instrument board.
Don't use your surgical touch on me.

312
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,273
I wanna collect my pension.

313
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,477
Don't worry, you'll be a burden
on the taxpayers for many years.

314
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,029
You're no better at flying than you are
with a knife.

315
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:11,270
I'll give you one more chance.
Monday morning.

316
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,477
You flunk that one,
and you're washed-out.

317
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,838
Hey, what's the rush?
You got something lined up in town?

318
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,117
No, it's either get off the station
or get a general court-martial.

319
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,633
General court? What for?

320
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:35,349
For punching that Joe Blake on the nose.
So long. See you later.

321
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:04,358
Why don't you learn how to drive!

322
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,639
Why do you drive in your sleep?

323
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,518
You came around with your
eyes shut.

324
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,917
Yeah, well, you saw me coming.
Why didn't you stop?

325
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,798
You got insurance on that fire truck?

326
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,190
No, they don't write it against
drivers like you.

327
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,351
It'll cost you about 50 bucks
to fix my car.

328
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:21,512
Fifty bucks? You crazy? You can buy
two of those crates for that.

329
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,274
Well, then maybe you'd rather
I take it out of your hide.

330
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,749
Yeah, why don't you try that.

331
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,518
Go get him, boy.

332
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,510
Sorry. I meant that last one for
somebody else. How are you doing?

333
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,477
All right.

334
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,953
- Say, you throw a mean punch there.
- You too. Where'd you learn that right?

335
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:57,839
At Yale. I was captain of
the boxing team last year.

336
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:02,232
Yale? Well, that explains everything.
I'm from Harvard. Put her there.

337
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,471
All right. Take her out alone.

338
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,073
Okay.

339
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,750
Sorry if I made good
and disappointed you.

340
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,831
It's a blow, all right.

341
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,037
Commander, there's just one more
thing I'd like to ask you.

342
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:42,760
- Yeah?
- Why do you dislike me so much?

343
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,878
Because you're a grandstand player,
and a phony on top of it.

344
00:37:46,040 --> 00:37:49,077
If Swede Larson's death makes you
say that, you're being childish.

345
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:51,674
His number was up before we got him
to the hospital.

346
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,115
I'm not responsible for his death
and you know it.

347
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,669
- Maybe so.
- Then why don't you quit riding me.

348
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,478
Our jobs are tough enough as it is.

349
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,114
I'll stay out of your way,
and you stay out of mine.

350
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,152
Now, get going.

351
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,388
Hit your left rudder.
Not your right, your left.

352
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,869
You're losing altitude fast.

353
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,996
You're gonna crash.

354
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,029
All right. Come on out.
You died a beautiful death.

355
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:59,195
This, gentlemen, perfectly sums up
today's discussion of blind flying.

356
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:02,079
This pilot crashed because
he trusted his senses.

357
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:05,471
His semicircular ear canals
lead him to believe, in the darkness...

358
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,154
...he was turning left when he was
turning right.

359
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,839
Never trust your senses.

360
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,309
Trust your instrument board.

361
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:20,240
Did my demonstration bore you,
Lieutenant Lee?

362
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:24,234
Oh, not at all, sir.
It brought up pleasant memories.

363
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,358
I studied the semicircular canals
in second-year medicine.

364
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,591
Did you, now?

365
00:39:29,760 --> 00:39:33,594
You also learned all about blind flying
at Harvard, Hopkins and Cambridge.

366
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:37,594
Oh, yes, I did quite a bit there, sir.
In a hopped-up jalopy, of course.

367
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:40,274
You must've been the pride and joy
of your professors.

368
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,232
You have no idea how they adored me.

369
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,911
Keep that if you like it.

370
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:57,191
Dr. Lee and all of you gentlemen,
a flight surgeon has been described...

371
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,920
...as a combination of Dutch uncle
and father confessor.

372
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:02,715
Because he's more
than the pilot's physician...

373
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:06,350
...he's a judge of their fitness to go on
with the work they've chosen.

374
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,750
For this task,
he must be conscientious...

375
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:12,276
...and above all, humble,
or he has no business being here.

376
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:16,915
Tomorrow, we'll take up the effect of
anoxia on the electrocardiogram.

377
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,832
Class dismissed.

378
00:40:19,160 --> 00:40:21,879
Boy, you sure got guts talking back
to him like that.

379
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,598
Surly character, isn't he?

380
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,834
I bet a blood sample would show gall,
bile, with a good dash of sulfuric acid.

381
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,156
Here's the one I'm working on now.

382
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:38,630
- See that strong bulkhead?
- Yeah.

383
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,349
What are the forces that pull
on a diving pilot when he blacks out?

384
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:43,839
Between 5 and 10 G.

385
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:46,958
Between five and 10 times
as strong as the pull of gravity.

386
00:40:47,120 --> 00:40:49,190
- Will it be more with faster ships?
- Not much.

387
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:52,989
If we lick blackout in our present planes,
the answer will be good a long time.

388
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:59,396
I've gone over these chamber
equipment lists. They seem okay to me.

389
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:01,711
Good evening, commander.

390
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,073
Who threw that knife?

391
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:12,470
I did. Came back pretty fast,
though, didn't it?

392
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:16,679
If he spent less energy being bitter
and more on flying, we might get action.

393
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:18,910
Maybe he has a right to be bitter.

394
00:41:19,080 --> 00:41:22,629
He wrecked his heart using himself
as a guinea pig on high-altitude flights.

395
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,793
Now he can't fly anymore and he's stuck
at a laboratory desk day and night.

396
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,077
- Rogers? Used himself as a guinea pig?
- That's right.

397
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,476
He's also the man who doped out
vitamin A for night blindness...

398
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,119
...optically correct goggles...

399
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,669
...and shoulder safety belts
to stop crash injuries.

400
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,789
As a flight surgeon, he's tops.

401
00:41:42,080 --> 00:41:44,992
Wow. I had no idea.

402
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,355
No, I didn't think you had.

403
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,916
Yes, come in.

404
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,072
Good evening.

405
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,314
I saw your lights,
so I thought I'd stop by.

406
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,436
What can I do for you, lieutenant?

407
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,957
Work seems to be piling up on you here.
I was wondering if I can help you with it.

408
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,476
- You might make those blood counts.
- Sure.

409
00:42:32,920 --> 00:42:34,876
These are mixed.

410
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:43,277
You know, it's...

411
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:46,918
...strange how wrong you can be
about things and people.

412
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:52,593
I suppose that's because everything's
so confused in the world these days.

413
00:42:52,760 --> 00:42:54,751
You need a jolt to bring you
to your senses.

414
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,153
When you stop to contemplate
some of...

415
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,437
...the things you've said and done,
it makes you feel like an idiot.

416
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,598
But I guess it all comes out
in the wash.

417
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,513
It certainly feels good
to be back in a lab.

418
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,479
Cigarette, doctor?

419
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,478
Thanks, doctor.

420
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:24,789
- I was just thinking of another odd thing.
- What's odd?

421
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,272
Of all the tests used for flying aptitude,
no one thought of trying the Rorschach.

422
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,438
What do you know about it?

423
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,431
Well, just enough to suspect
it might be valuable.

424
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:39,831
- Don't you agree?
- I agree that we ought to try it.

425
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,230
- We?
- You and I.

426
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:46,188
You do all the hard work, and I'll take
all the glory, if any. That suit you?

427
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:48,396
Sure. Any way you want it.

428
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:51,474
Doctor, I'm disappointed
in my judgment.

429
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:53,119
I'm beginning to like you.

430
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,394
Doctor, I'm just suffering
a similar disillusionment.

431
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,994
I'm beginning to suspect you're almost
human yourself.

432
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:25,190
Douglas Lee.

433
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:36,436
William Lester Keel.

434
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,559
Good luck to all of you.

435
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:46,439
The commandant's aide will give you
your orders.

436
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:51,038
Gregory? Here you are, Slim.

437
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:57,439
Company commanders, take charge.
Dismissed.

438
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,399
What did you draw?

439
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,597
Aircraft carrier <i>Saratoga</i>, Pearl Harbor.

440
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:17,432
I go to Norfolk for assignment.

441
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,670
Well, soft shoulders and happy landings.

442
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,512
- You too. Norfolk?
- Yeah.

443
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:24,148
Say, I know a cute redhead there
if you get lonesome.

444
00:45:24,320 --> 00:45:27,118
Well, I'm lonesome now.
Is she big or small?

445
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:29,236
Well, she's sort of... She's...

446
00:45:29,400 --> 00:45:31,595
Oh, what's the difference?
She's cute anyway.

447
00:45:31,760 --> 00:45:33,478
You'll have to give me her address.

448
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:46,518
What was your luck?

449
00:45:46,680 --> 00:45:49,353
- Honolulu. The <i>Saratoga.</i>
- Not bad.

450
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,876
Not bad at all, but it's a long way
from my real interest, research.

451
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,759
That's life. Soon as a man gets
warmed up for research...

452
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,115
...he's yanked off for duty.
Never seen it fail.

453
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,511
Yeah, I guess so. Discouraging, though.
Guess it's one of those things.

454
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:05,355
- How'd you like to stay as my assistant?
- I'd like to stand on my head.

455
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:08,671
I asked for you and Washington
okayed it. This just came.

456
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:10,353
I'm gonna work you half to death.

457
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:14,149
Research will be in addition to your other
duties: examining cadets and pilots.

458
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,912
You'll wish you'd gone to Waikiki.

459
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,833
- Never mind that. What's step A?
- Our old friend blackout.

460
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,515
- Doctor, I don't know how to thank you.
- I can't hear a word you're saying.

461
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:25,353
Well, I'll be right with you.

462
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,599
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

463
00:46:27,760 --> 00:46:30,069
- Would you like something to eat?
- No, thanks.

464
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,515
Would you like a drink?

465
00:46:34,760 --> 00:46:36,716
Pardon me.

466
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:39,752
Sorry.

467
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:45,030
- There you are, Mrs. Fisher.
- Thank you. You're so sweet to me.

468
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:47,191
Don't mention it.

469
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:50,280
So you're from Baltimore?

470
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,239
- Where's Mr. Fisher? Is he in Baltimore?
- I just lost him.

471
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,749
- I'm sorry.
- I just lost him in Reno.

472
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:59,195
- I suffered no pain.
- That's different, isn't it?

473
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,238
- It is indeed. Quite different.
- You here all alone?

474
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:05,760
All alone, commander,
until I leave for Honolulu.

475
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,832
- You have friends there?
- Yes. Some very nice friends.

476
00:47:10,240 --> 00:47:13,277
Tell me, don't you ever get lonesome
traveling alone like this?

477
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:14,873
Often.

478
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:19,511
What are you doing for dinner?
Maybe you'd like to have dinner with me.

479
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:22,757
- That might be arranged.
- Fine. Where would you like to eat?

480
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:26,833
Why, I don't know. My hotel is as good
as any place. It's quite convenient.

481
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,639
- Swell, Mrs. Fisher.
- I think you can call me Linda.

482
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,071
- Thanks. I'm Joe.
- Hello, Joe.

483
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,832
Hi, Linda.

484
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,670
- How about another drink?
- I'd love it.

485
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,035
I'll be back in a minute, Linda.

486
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:44,678
- Pardon me.
- Oh, sorry.

487
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:50,351
- Hello, Bill.
- Hello, Doug.

488
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:52,158
- Hello, Dr. Lee.
- Hello, Mrs. Silvers.

489
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,912
- Nice of you to drop in.
- Thank you.

490
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,072
- May I introduce you around?
- No, I think I know almost everyone.

491
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,357
- Circulate. Have fun.
- Thanks. I'll put my hat over here.

492
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,073
- Hello, Tim.
- Why, Doug, how are you?

493
00:48:14,600 --> 00:48:17,637
- Hello, you beast.
- Sugar! No kicking, now.

494
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,678
Not yet. You know, it's strange.
When I woke up this morning...

495
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:22,831
...I knew something nice would
happen today.

496
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,036
- Well, so did I, and this must be it.
- Shake.

497
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,397
- Aren't you going to kiss me?
- Oh, yes. Darling, how are you?

498
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:42,398
- What are you doing here?
- I'm stationed here. How about you?

499
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:45,711
You didn't answer my letters.
I was going to Honolulu to see you.

500
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,952
Darling, I'm divorced.

501
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:50,634
Charlie now belongs to the ages.
Isn't that pleasant?

502
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:53,030
- Oh, that's wonderful.
- Come on, let's sit down.

503
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:56,875
- Oh, Dr. Lee, this is Commander...
- Blake.

504
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,758
- Blake.
- We know each other.

505
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:00,433
Sure, we're old friends.

506
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,950
Then give my precious a drink.
The commander and I were going...

507
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:06,759
...to dine together tonight,
and you must come with us.

508
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,230
Doug and I are old friends too.
But very old friends.

509
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,233
I helped to cheer him up in Honolulu.

510
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:17,109
- You certainly did.
- You're such a beast, but so sweet.

511
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:19,555
And here I go throwing myself
at you again.

512
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,598
Come on. Let's get out of here.

513
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,359
Come on, Commander...

514
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:29,432
Blake. No, you two run along.
I remembered I have watch tonight.

515
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,716
How unpleasant.
Well, I'll go powder my nose...

516
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:35,953
...tell our hostess a customary lie and be
right back. Meet you in the hall, Doug.

517
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:39,396
Why am I such a chump
where you're concerned?

518
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,869
If you had an engagement with the lady,
don't let me stand in your way.

519
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,349
Too bad there are no women on
the selection board.

520
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,750
You'd be an admiral inside of a year.

521
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,394
All right. Come on with the box.

522
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,949
She's got recording instruments
and a movie camera...

523
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,635
...to photograph your faces while you're
unconscious. Just turn the switch.

524
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,438
What? No bathtub? No hostess?

525
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,591
No, you'll have to furnish
your own hostess.

526
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:09,990
From what I hear,
you're the guy who can do it.

527
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,152
Oh, you have, eh?
Well, every knock's a boost, you know.

528
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,551
I understand I'm flying
for you gentlemen.

529
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:22,149
Nice way to spend my time.
I haven't had much to do.

530
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:26,279
Just training the cadets, flying at night
and... Is Casanova in on this?

531
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,352
- Dr. Lee will act as medical observer.
- You gonna be the pilot?

532
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,677
You can't feel worse about it than I do.

533
00:50:31,960 --> 00:50:34,269
If that's so, why not give the job
to someone else?

534
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,635
My group was ordered
to send a pilot for a test.

535
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:39,519
In a good outfit, the skipper does it.
What are the orders?

536
00:50:39,680 --> 00:50:42,399
Service dives to terminal velocity.
Nine-G pullouts.

537
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,120
On the first one,
tense your muscles from head to toe...

538
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:47,714
...pull your bellies in hard,
yell as loud as you can.

539
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,075
We want to see if that slows
or stops blackouts.

540
00:50:50,240 --> 00:50:52,470
- All right. You ready?
- Yeah.

541
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,359
All right, men, pull her out.

542
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,715
Now we're at 15,000 feet
and leveling off.

543
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:57,790
Here's the dive.

544
00:52:05,640 --> 00:52:07,551
Twelve thousand.

545
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:09,519
Nine thousand.

546
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:12,556
Five thousand.

547
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,951
Now we're pulling out.
Still yelling.

548
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,871
Here's the blackout.

549
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,878
Well, there you are.
The yelling didn't help at all.

550
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:43,157
- Your blackout was slower.
- Well, what does that prove?

551
00:52:43,320 --> 00:52:46,153
I think we're on the right track,
but we overlooked something.

552
00:52:46,320 --> 00:52:47,833
Yeah, a way to stop blackouts.

553
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,150
Might as well run a Mickey Mouse
as that stuff.

554
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:52,709
Look, I want to tell you something
about that dive.

555
00:52:52,880 --> 00:52:55,235
When we were pulling out of it,
I was bending over.

556
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:57,516
My camera was stuck
and I was trying to fix it.

557
00:52:57,680 --> 00:53:01,070
- I didn't black out, just went hazy.
- Bending over? What could that do?

558
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,876
I don't know. Maybe it's equalizing
the pull, something like that.

559
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:07,793
- Meeting gravity halfway.
- Possible, but not probable.

560
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,910
Bending over puts the heart
level with the brain.

561
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,991
It might hold the blood above
heart level.

562
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:15,355
Next time, try bending
over low as you can.

563
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,112
First it's yells, then it's bends.

564
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:19,151
Maybe we should try ski jumping next.

565
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:21,880
Wait a minute. It may be a guess,
but it's worth trying.

566
00:53:22,040 --> 00:53:25,112
Sit down. I'll show you
the physiological principle involved.

567
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:31,317
Well, come out of the test tube, men.

568
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:33,755
- Fifty cadets are waiting for examination.
- Right.

569
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,273
Well, back to earth again.

570
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:39,638
Now you know how Einstein feels when
he has to add up the household bills.

571
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:44,468
Take your places for inspection.

572
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:47,995
All right. Come on.
Take them over here.

573
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:58,917
- How many are there?
- About 30, sir.

574
00:53:59,080 --> 00:54:02,072
General physical.
Heart, lungs, height, weight, index.

575
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,515
- Take the ear examination.
- All right. Shirts off!

576
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:07,035
All right, gentlemen, give way, please.

577
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:10,913
- More civilians?
- Yes, sir.

578
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,559
Remember me, sir?

579
00:54:13,720 --> 00:54:16,871
Lucky, Pearl Harbor. I've just been
detailed to be your assistant.

580
00:54:17,040 --> 00:54:19,508
Remember you?
You're a window in the house of my life.

581
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:21,591
Good to see you.
Glad you got transferred.

582
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:24,553
So am I, sir. I'm a new man
since I got away from my wife.

583
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,836
I feel 10 years younger.
I'm putting on weight.

584
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:28,911
Lucky, come over here.

585
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,676
It's sure nice to be back with you again.

586
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:34,353
Thanks, Lucky, right back at you.

587
00:54:34,520 --> 00:54:36,909
There's a babe in the pay office
looking for you.

588
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,833
- A babe?
- Yeah, a blond with a Brooklyn accent.

589
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,195
She's getting an allotment blank
for your pay.

590
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:46,599
My wife! That can't be!
She couldn't have swum from Honolulu.

591
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:50,070
I wouldn't put it past her.
Sir, I gotta hide right away.

592
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:51,832
This can happen to the best of men.

593
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,513
- Go right ahead.
- Thank you, sir.

594
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,955
Head her off. Stop her!
Give me a break, will you?

595
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,633
Where are you going to hide?

596
00:54:57,800 --> 00:54:59,358
How about the Isolation Ward?

597
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,114
Lieutenant, you got genius.
Come on!

598
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:04,316
Yeah, but, Lucky, can't you...?

599
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:17,519
Where is he? Where's my husband?

600
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:18,999
- Mrs. James?
- In person.

601
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:21,754
He's in there, but you can't go in.
He's a very sick man.

602
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:24,195
He'll be a lot sicker
when I get through with him.

603
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:28,672
I hate to tell you this,
but they're afraid he's got:

604
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:32,037
If that ever gets in the arm, the whole:

605
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,474
The neck starts:

606
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:35,471
Comes down the... on the racetrack.

607
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:40,156
And any time you go into... the... and:

608
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:41,639
It's very serious.

609
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:43,950
Whatever that is,
it's too good for him.

610
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,913
Don't get too close.
It's very contagious.

611
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,350
You see, ma'am,
how it comes and goes?

612
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,036
- And so will I.
- And so will I.

613
00:55:58,320 --> 00:56:00,072
Head up.

614
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,997
All right. Down again.
Feel dizzy?

615
00:56:03,160 --> 00:56:05,833
- Yes, sir.
- It's all right, Abbott.

616
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:08,992
- It's a perfectly normal reaction.
- Oh, thank you, sir.

617
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:10,479
- Feel all right?
- Yes, sir.

618
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:13,200
I can see you are.
Report to the training office.

619
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:16,273
- Thank you, sir.
- Who's next? You...?

620
00:56:21,080 --> 00:56:23,116
Well, it's a small world, isn't it?

621
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,599
Yes, sir.

622
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:27,638
- Getting plenty of exercise lately?
- Yes, sir. Too much, sir.

623
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,119
That's good.

624
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:31,555
If one eye sees higher,
which would you land with?

625
00:56:31,720 --> 00:56:33,039
The good one, sir.

626
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:35,873
Better keep your left up,
or you won't have a good one.

627
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:37,758
I won't forget that, sir.

628
00:56:37,920 --> 00:56:40,832
- What's your middle name?
- Thomas. John Thomas Anthony III, sir.

629
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,833
Born Hempstead, New York,
June the 12th, anno Domini 1919.

630
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,436
This is 1941, San Diego, California,
9:30 a.m., sir.

631
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,638
Very good.

632
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:52,431
Make a note. Mentally alert...

633
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,239
...fresh as a new-laid egg.
Well, an egg anyway.

634
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,789
Favorite sports: automobile racing
and boxing. Ready?

635
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,190
- Yes, sir.
- Here you go.

636
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:05,157
Head down! Hold them, Yale!

637
00:57:07,600 --> 00:57:10,398
He says he's practically got the stick
between his teeth now.

638
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:12,516
All right. Cut the motor.

639
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:15,679
Why don't you be practical.

640
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:19,037
You can't use your bending-over routine
without changing the cockpit.

641
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,270
How can a pilot aim with his head
bent down?

642
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:24,034
Well, he might try a periscope
or a Ouija board.

643
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:27,397
Can you design a bomber so the pilot
can lie down and aim the bomb...

644
00:57:27,560 --> 00:57:30,358
...through the nose of the ship?
- Who's it for? Buck Rogers?

645
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:33,432
- Seriously. Can it be done?
- I suppose a pilot could lie down...

646
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,910
...and use auxiliary controls during
the dive, but it sounds silly to me.

647
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:39,873
Things are tough when a pilot
has to fly on his stomach.

648
00:57:40,040 --> 00:57:42,634
I'll ask the design section,
but I'm sure they'll send...

649
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,314
...an order transferring me
to a nut house.

650
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,994
When you two figure out
your next move, let me know.

651
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,479
I'll be down in Squadron 2.

652
00:57:49,680 --> 00:57:51,750
Gentlemen, I have a solution
to your problem.

653
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,992
Provide each dive-bombing pilot
with an old-fashioned stiff collar.

654
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:59,438
That will choke him and keep the blood
from rushing from his brain. So long.

655
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,357
Very funny.
Very funny.

656
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:05,795
"High, tight, old-fashioned stiff collar."

657
00:58:05,960 --> 00:58:10,158
What that guy needs is a high, tight,
old-fashioned whack over the head.

658
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,078
Stiff collar.

659
00:58:12,840 --> 00:58:14,831
- Hey.
- What?

660
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:17,275
What that half-wit just said
about a collar...

661
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:19,829
...except it's not a collar,
it's a belt, understand?

662
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:21,672
- Frankly, no.
- Look, Lance...

663
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:24,832
...you make a belt that fits around here.
It's rubber. Pneumatic.

664
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:26,718
Just before the dive, you inflate it.

665
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:29,440
That will push the stomach up
under the ribs, like this:

666
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:31,636
Compress the whole upper part
of the abdomen.

667
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,268
That will keep the blood
above heart level.

668
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,837
Come on, Lucky, hurry up.

669
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:41,753
What happens if this glorified corset
ain't right, sir?

670
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:45,117
You heard the story about the guy
whose parachute didn't open, right?

671
00:58:45,280 --> 00:58:47,669
- Do you know how to get into it?
- Sure, it's simple.

672
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:49,432
At least it was when I designed it.

673
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:52,034
Here, place me under the bag, will you?

674
00:58:53,320 --> 00:58:56,073
- That's it.
- This makes me feel right at home, sir.

675
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:58,032
How does it work?

676
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:01,715
This hooks up to the pressure flask in
the cockpit. When you start a dive...

677
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:04,792
...you release the valve, it inflates it.
Does that, we hope.

678
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,918
It works the way it has on the ground,
it ought to be a cinch.

679
00:59:08,080 --> 00:59:09,638
Did you tell Blake I was waiting?

680
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:13,628
He said he'd be here when he finishes
lining up the National Defense Program.

681
00:59:13,840 --> 00:59:16,308
Oh, he did, eh?
That's very clever of him.

682
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,358
Pressure belts, pressure chambers.

683
00:59:18,520 --> 00:59:22,399
Flying's getting to be as tough as my
wife. Pressure on you all the time.

684
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,152
Yeah.

685
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,517
Aren't you going to wait
for the commander, sir?

686
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:32,359
You're breaking regulations, doctor.
The commander will be awful sore.

687
00:59:32,520 --> 00:59:35,796
Tell him I'll write him a letter
and explain everything.

688
00:59:49,560 --> 00:59:51,676
Joe, isn't that your test tube
taking off?

689
00:59:54,640 --> 00:59:55,993
Yeah, what's the idea?

690
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:58,037
Looks like you're being stood up, pal.

691
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:02,113
That lamebrain. He can't fly that ship.
There won't be enough left to identify.

692
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:14,952
Don't blame me if anything happens.

693
01:00:15,120 --> 01:00:17,031
He shouldn't have done it.
I told him that.

694
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:20,715
I mean, I was gonna tell him that.
But he got away so fast, I couldn't.

695
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,075
He ain't had enough experience
to fly that ship.

696
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,676
- He's heading for the last roundup.
- Pipe down. What's the matter with you?

697
01:00:26,840 --> 01:00:28,592
Nothing, sir. I'm just neurotic.
