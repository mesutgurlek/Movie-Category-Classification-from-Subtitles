2
00:00:25,931 --> 00:00:29,177
The only thing I know for certain is that
these are bad people.

3
00:00:29,177 --> 00:00:33,559
We look forward to working with the Blair
Governnment to deal with the issue

4
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:41,831
My parents went to Pakistan
and they saw a bride for me.

5
00:00:41,831 --> 00:00:46,617
My mum come back said I 
should go out to Pakistan and get married.

6
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:49,149
So I got a ticket and I went.

7
00:00:50,524 --> 00:00:51,513
Can I help?

8
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:52,801
I'm all right.

8
00:00:52,801 --> 00:00:54,958
Have you got everything?

8
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:57,715
-I'll be ten minutes.
-Okay, hurry up, quickly.

8
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,798
I didn't really wanna go 
because I had a job, I was working.

8
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,759
But she was telling me 
"lt"s time for you to go to Pakistan"

9
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,950
I left from Birmingham Airport.

10
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,191
And from there I went 
straight to Faisalabad.

11
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,194
And then I caught a taxi to my village.

12
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,440
My father was there at the time.

13
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:46,830
- Oh, Salaam. Hello, Asif, how are you? 
- Good. i'm alright.

14
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,069
I was there for about four days.

15
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,754
I saw the girl and I decided 
I would get married.

16
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,393
So I phone Ruhel.

17
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,789
-Hello, Ruhel?

18
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,789
- Asif, what go on? I ain't heard
from you in long, man.

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:04,193
Well, when he asked me to go to his
wedding, I thought "Yeah, why not?"

19
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,303
"End of the day he's my friend
and I should go!"

19
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:09,390
And also, it' be great holiday.

20
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,793
See you later, all right.

21
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,271
- Come back soon.
- All right. I'll come back soon.

22
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,755
Bye.

23
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:30,831
I wanted to go to Asif's wedding,
plus I hadn't been to Pakistan for like 13 years

24
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,469
And I wanted to see
some of my family again.

25
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,109
-You got a passport, yeah? Visa? everything?
- Yeah, i got it, man.

26
00:12:40,011 --> 00:02:41,920
- You all right, Monir, yeah?
- Yeah, i'm good, man. How are you?

27
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,718
oh, Can't believe we're going to Pakistan, man.

28
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,837
It's gonna be mad.

30
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,753
Mlonir was a very nice guy
He was Bengali like me

31
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,515
He would never say anything 
bad against anybody.

32
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,557
We landed at Karachi.

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,514
We didn't want to stay in the hotel
cos we thought it'd be expensive.

34
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,396
So we went to a mosque.

35
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,076
- Salaam alaikum. 
- Alaikum salaam.

36
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:46,392
Crowds marching in the streets 
of Karachi today...

37
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,475
...organised by Pakistan's Islamic parties,
they're supporters of the Taliban.

38
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:55,193
It's one sign of the politcal turmoil that seems...

39
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,790
certain to follow American military
intervention in Afghanistan

40
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:04,755
We spent about a week in Karachi. 
Walked around sightseeing.

41
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,877
Going shopping, just chilling out.

42
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,395
Shafiq went to visit his family...

43
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,473
...so me and Monir had 
a few days to ourselves.

44
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:20,350
They were supposed to come 
to the Village, but, instead...

45
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,431
...I ended up going to Karachi.

46
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,591
When Shafiq came back to Karachi, 
he brought his cousin Zahid with him.

47
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,910
- Where are you from in Pakistan?
- I'm from Multan.

48
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,195
Ruhel was kind of like my best friend, yeah.

49
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:53,034
Even though he was Bengali.

50
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,277
I'Ve known Asif since the day he was born.

51
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:01,117
- What's been going on, man?
- Mainly I've just been shitting.

52
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:05,988
It was Friday prayers and we were 
walking past the mosque.

53
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,357
A lot of people were going in,
so we went in with them

54
00:05:09,724 --> 00:05:14,614
The bombing of Afghanistan!...

54
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:20,275
...the forcible change
of power in Afghanistan...

54
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:28,313
...this can only lead to chaos and terror.

54
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,632
People get hyped. 
Then they start shouting slogans out.

55
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,076
The preacher was saying "You should help
the Afghani people wherever you can".

56
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,189
And also was thinking of going to see what
Afghanistan is really like.

57
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:49,553
If everyone agrees to go, then we go.
Because it's only 250 rupees.

58
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:53,918
If we're going there, we're going, 
One: For experience and Two: To help

59
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,277
You know the food there as well...
You know the naans?

60
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,239
Big naans, you know that. Big naans.

61
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:03,074
I've seen naans this big.

62
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,035
What language do they speak there?
Can I speak Urdu to them or what?

63
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,669
- I think they speak Pushtu there. 
- Pushtu?

64
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,749
We don't know yeah, basically.... 
The only way we know is if we go and see it.

65
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,831
Grab that cushion, man.

66
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,111
Give him the rice and that. 
No-one's even eating it.

67
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:23,830
If that's all we're doing in Afghanistan,
that'll be a good thing, you know what i mean.

68
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,834
Basically, while i was there, the two weeks,
all the people I spoke to in Pakistan...

69
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,719
...they were saying, 
"Oh, Afghanistan's not gonna get attacked".

70
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:43,272
So, we jumped on a bus and off we went.

71
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,670
- Are you all right? 
- No.

71
00:06:54,485 --> 00:06:57,928
In Pakistan many people
have beards.

71
00:06:57,928 --> 00:07:00,714
There are always good
and bad people.

72
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,310
Have you seen the flies up there?

73
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:44,673
In the night, the bus driver hit someone.
An we all got out to look.

74
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,478
The bus driver just ran off.

75
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,951
So we had to find another bus driver 
to drive us to Quetta.

76
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,640
When we got to Quetta, 
we had to change buses.

77
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,949
Just before we got to the border, 
we stopped at a mosque.

78
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,433
That's how I got left behind.

79
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,835
Where's Shaf?

80
00:08:56,946 --> 00:08:59,358
Stop! We've left someone!

80
00:08:59,358 --> 00:09:02,001
Can you take me to the Afghan border?

81
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,833
Border trade continues unimpeded.

82
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,192
Amongst those crossing are 
brave Afghan aid workers.

83
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,070
The people rely on them for food
and health care...

84
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:30,153
...and to explain their needs
to the outside world.

85
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,155
They come on motorbikes and we paid
them, 200 rupees.

86
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,908
An they took us across the border.

87
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:47,076
- We'll come back for you tomorrow.
- Shut up...

88
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,191
I ended up walking across the border.

89
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,390
No-one stopped me.

90
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,996
Where the fuck were you?!

91
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:31,831
You dickheads. How could you fucking
leave without me, man?

92
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,753
You love to shit, dldnt you? 
Next time you can shit in the van

92
00:10:35,318 --> 00:10:36,202
Hurry up.

93
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:39,716
And when we crossed the border,
it looked like "Oh, it's nothing...

94
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:43,793
...you just cross over", it's not even like
going into a different country.

94
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,827
But once we got there, it was
a different situation.

95
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,277
You see that?

96
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:12,833
Soon as we got to Kandahar, that's when
the bombings start happening.

97
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:17,074
Fucking shit.

98
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,312
Look at that.

99
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,635
It's terrifying.

100
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,637
You see something like that
in the movies only.

100
00:11:42,842 --> 00:11:45,989
Please let me sleep.

100
00:11:46,089 --> 00:11:48,089
Why are you making noise?

101
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,751
I feel like shit, man.

102
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,429
Oi...Look at them naans. 
Fucking big.

103
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,636
- Yeah, they're massive. 
- We'll get two.

104
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,031
Give me some.

105
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:14,919
Kandahar in the south of Afghanistan.
The Taliban heartland.

106
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:18,709
These pictures from Al-Jazeera show
support for the Taliban...

107
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,873
...seems still strong here despite 
American bombing.

107
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,096
Long live Osama Bin Laden!

108
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,113
We just spent one day in Kandahar and
then we left for Kabul.

109
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,837
The journey to Kabul was terrible.

110
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,510
Just go to sleep. 
By the time you wake up, we'll be there.

111
00:12:42,721 --> 00:12:45,524
Can we stop? He's really sick.

111
00:12:45,624 --> 00:12:47,806
No, we're not stopping.

111
00:12:52,522 --> 00:12:54,001
How far is it to Kabul?

111
00:12:54,101 --> 00:12:56,670
Ten to twelve hours away.

112
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,317
Are you okay?

112
00:12:58,459 --> 00:13:02,065
You're fine. Don't worry so much.

112
00:13:02,165 --> 00:13:04,805
There's nothing wrong with you.

113
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,956
Tell him to shut up, man, Asif, man

113
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:09,660
Pull yourself together.

114
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:12,596
- Is he hot, man?
- Tell him to shut the fuck up, man.

114
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:14,951
We'll stop a few minutes.

115
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:47,638
US bombing raids continue
around the clock...

116
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,951
...attacking Taliban tanks and trenches
north of Kabul.

117
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:16,630
We stayed in Kabul for about
two and a half weeks.

118
00:14:17,008 --> 00:14:28,880
(RUHEL): Wait, I want to buy some...
- Let's get out of here before we get mobbed.

119
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,110
SHAFIQ: (MUMBLES) - Mad fucking shit, man.

120
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,470
Do you want a bite,man? Do you want a bite?

121
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,273
It stinks.

122
00:14:37,696 --> 00:14:40,331
It's just like spices and shit, man.
(RUHEL) Enough of that shit, yeah?

123
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,908
He went that bad in Afghanistan that I
thought he was gonna die.

124
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,198
- How are you feeling? 
- I'm cold, man.

125
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:20,039
Put your head up, man. Put your head up.

126
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:37,718
- This bread is shit. 
- Better than nothing.

127
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:40,394
You know the stuffed crust pizzas...

128
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,750
...with the melted cheese in the crust,man.

129
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,588
I think the naan's getting to you.

130
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,390
What's wrong? What's wrong?
Go on, eat it like a...

131
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,390
Eye witnesses are describing the latest
American raids on Afghanistan

132
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,234
...as the heaviest bombardment so far.

133
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,074
Once again the capital Kabul is bearing the
brunt of the attacks.

134
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,198
Residents have described wave upon wave
of aircraft...

135
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,914
...an a huge fire out near the city's airport.

136
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,957
We were basically just chilling out.

137
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,833
And we were just getting pissed off because
we're not doing anything.

138
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,235
This is not what we came for.

138
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:40,513
Salam Alecum Do you speak Urdu?

138
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:41,933
Is Sher Khan here?

138
00:16:42,033 --> 00:16:44,386
We want to talk about something.

138
00:16:44,486 --> 00:16:47,996
We want to go back to Pakistan.

138
00:16:48,096 --> 00:16:50,096
Why?

138
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:53,161
We're not doing anything here.

138
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:56,195
We're not helping, just lying around.

138
00:16:56,295 --> 00:17:00,809
Can you arrange something for us?

138
00:17:00,909 --> 00:17:02,391
Okay, I'll sort out a car for you.

138
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:03,247
Really?

138
00:17:03,347 --> 00:17:04,627
Yes, no problem.

139
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:08,390
- What did he say?
- He'll sort out the car into Pakistan.
- Sure. Yeah.

140
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:14,799
For the first time bombs landed in the centre
of the Afghan capital.

141
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,952
This is said to be a residential area.

142
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:21,490
No deaths were claimed here, but the
Taliban say 15 people were killed...

143
00:17:21,497 --> 00:17:25,067
...when a missile struck a mosque in Jalalabad.

143
00:17:30,083 --> 00:17:33,315
-Is this going to Pakistan?
-Yes, let's go.

144
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,631
Come on, let's go.

145
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:39,954
We just got on it, assumed it was taking us
in the right direction.

146
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,515
We're buying these lot drinks now as well.
Jacked us last time.

147
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:39,879
An we ended up in this house in the
middle of nowhere.

148
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,833
That's when we was thinking, 
"Where the hell are we? What's happening?"

149
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,674
This guy used to come to us and we used to
ask him every day.

150
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,999
Then one day he came and 
took us to Kunduz.

151
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,555
The United Front soldiers on the 
road to Kunduz...

152
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:03,796
...were in high spirits this morning.

153
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:06,474
Word was out that
the city was about to fall...

154
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,234
...an these men hoped to be among the
first to drive in.

155
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,155
Everywhere you looked there was foreigners.. 
And you could tell...

156
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:19,874
...they were all fighters because they had
the Kalashnikovs.

157
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,109
Bombs never dropped in town, but they
dropped on the outskirts.

158
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,230
Once we were in Kunduz, we were trapped.

158
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:57,722
Zahid, what's he saying?

158
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,852
He's talking about the war.

158
00:20:01,996 --> 00:20:04,759
Two years ago in Dostum's jail...   

158
00:20:04,859 --> 00:20:07,139
...he had his fingers cut off one by one.
His brother was killed.

158
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:11,160
He was pulled apart by two tanks.

159
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,513
Dostum? Who is it?

160
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,154
Dostum, the guy who is bombing on us.

160
00:20:14,976 --> 00:20:19,056
They shouted: 
"Long life the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan"

160
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:21,265
And 'Death to America'.

161
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,672
Basically, I thought, 
"This is gonna be my last few days".

162
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,956
Northern Alliance Commanders say this...

163
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:33,153
...is the last battle for the Taliban's last
northern stronghold.

164
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:40,991
News came that they have actually broke the
front line in Kunduz...

165
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:44,391
...and had actually entered Kunduz and
everyone started panicking.

166
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,678
Everyone just ran towards the trucks.

166
00:20:53,448 --> 00:20:55,448
What's going on? 

167
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:59,069
We started looking for Monir, 
we couldn't find him.

168
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,351
Wait, Shaf. We gotta get Monir.

168
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:05,125
You've got to leave now. 

168
00:21:09,886 --> 00:21:11,770
Where's my friend Monir?

168
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:13,870
What's happening?

168
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:17,090
Some have already gone. Let's go.

169
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,434
ok, Let's go check in here, Shaf.

170
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,029
Monir?

171
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:22,677
Monir?

172
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,108
Monir?

173
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,229
Monir?

174
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:29,436
Monir?

174
00:21:31,174 --> 00:21:32,193
we have to go now.

174
00:21:32,293 --> 00:21:34,293
Lets go!

174
00:21:35,948 --> 00:21:37,356
He's not here, cousin.

174
00:21:37,456 --> 00:21:39,456
Where's Monir?

175
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,470
Let's just get on, man.

175
00:21:42,569 --> 00:21:44,779
We have safe passage.

176
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,758
Monir! Is he on that one?

177
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,353
Monir, where are you?

178
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,354
An we ended up on the trucks and people
going "Oh, You'll find him, you'll find him".

179
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:58,675
But we never did

180
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:05,109
So that's the last time I seen Monir.

181
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,437
We just literally drove about a good hour, to
the outskirts of Kunduz...

182
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:16,992
...and they dropped us off. They had to go
back and collect the people left.

183
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:22,998
We told each other that we're always 
gonna stick together.

184
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,438
And then all of a sudden 
there was bombing.

185
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,955
Wait there. Wait there, man.

186
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,639
Ruhel. Ruhel!

187
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:02,589
Ruhel!

188
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,957
Fucking hell!

189
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:17,953
Get up!

190
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,794
Run!

191
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,034
All night we went in a big circle and we
came back from where we started off.

192
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:37,748
Salaam.

193
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:40,838
- Salaam alaikum. 
- Alaikum salaam.

194
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,794
Yo Shaf! I'm going this way.

195
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:13,755
Shafiq and Asif were on that truck. 
If I put my shoes on...

196
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:17,714
and got on to the truck, then maybe we
wouldnt be alive

197
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,231
And you could hear people screaming, and
every person I came across...

198
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,519
...basically either his legs or arms were blown away or his
stomach was popping out, his arms come off.

199
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:59,951
When someone's in agony and you can't do
anything for them...

200
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:02,555
...it affects you in a big way.

200
00:26:13,849 --> 00:26:15,849
What's happened?

200
00:26:18,179 --> 00:26:19,696
Bomb blast.

200
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,610
Are you hurt?

200
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:23,679
Are you all right?

200
00:26:23,779 --> 00:26:25,779
Where's Shafiq?

200
00:26:26,905 --> 00:26:27,664
Over there.

200
00:26:27,764 --> 00:26:29,292
Water?

200
00:26:29,392 --> 00:26:31,392
Ok

201
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:39,639
He was basically just covered in blood.

202
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:44,556
Every part of his beard, his face,
everywhere, was covered in blood...

203
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,837
...and you could smell the stench of blood
on him.

204
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:02,269
Ruhel!

205
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,514
-Ruhel and the others were on the 
truck and I just jumped on
- Asif!

206
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,557
We watched as Taliban fighters crossed the
front line...

207
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,115
...in a long stream of Vehicles.

208
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,999
This is the largest single surrender of
Taliban forces...

209
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,600
... that has been witnessed by
outsiders such as ourselves.

210
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:33,877
The United Front knows that the eyes of the
outside world are upon them

211
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:37,231
...and especially on how they treat their
prisoners, Afghans...

212
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,119
...but especially those
from outside the country.

213
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:46,279
We came out with this hope that they are
our brothers, they are Muslims...

214
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,950
...and they would not abuse us or treat us badly, 
and that's also what they promised us.

215
00:27:56,480 --> 00:28:00,519
They did not take us far.  
It must have been about 3 or 4 miles

215
00:28:17,336 --> 00:28:19,336
Come on!

215
00:28:23,494 --> 00:28:25,494
Sit down!

215
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:31,577
Take him.

215
00:28:34,702 --> 00:28:36,702
No talking!

215
00:28:37,523 --> 00:28:39,523
Everybody down.

215
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,530
Silence!

215
00:28:42,279 --> 00:28:44,438
Search them!

216
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,558
I thought the guy's gonna kill me, because
he started pointing his gun at me.

216
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,406
What is this?

216
00:29:01,506 --> 00:29:02,844
Huh? What's this?

216
00:29:02,944 --> 00:29:04,944
This one's Pakistani.

216
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:06,518
That's for you.

216
00:29:06,618 --> 00:29:08,618
Pakistani! Come here!

217
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:26,593
At that time I was thinking, 
they're gonna open fire on everybody.

218
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:36,634
And in the distance they was like, 
they were making mass graves for people...

219
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,877
...and they were throwing bodies in. 
And you could see on the other side...

220
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:44,033
...there were people who had been injured
and you could tell they were still alive...

221
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,270
...and they were throwing them into the
ditch as well.

222
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,397
They tied our hands behind our backs...

223
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:53,871
...really tight, so you'd lose circulation in
your arms.

224
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:19,268
Fuck.

225
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:51,911
There's a massive ditch there.
They sat everybody into the ditch, 
and around that ditch there were gunmen.

226
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:56,552
An everyone thought 
"Yeah, they're gonna shoot everyone in this ditch, and kill us all".

227
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,189
Me and Shaf managed to get on the same
truck.

228
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:26,517
Asif was with us, but because the truck was
full he couldn't get on.

229
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,157
It must have been about a day, 
a day and a half to Mazar-e-Sharif.

230
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,831
Me an Shaf were lucky, we got on to the
canvas container.

231
00:32:14,002 --> 00:32:20,102
It was ram-packed. 

232
00:32:21,802 --> 00:32:26,102
After about five minutes,
it started getting really humid.

233
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:31,637
And it was starting to get difficult to breathe.

234
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:39,035
Some people, they were screaming. Some
were banging, some were praying.

235
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:44,188
I got up and I started screaming.

236
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:47,717
And, like, the guy who was next to me,
he pulled me down.

237
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:51,356
As he brought me down, it was,
like, easier to breathe.

238
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:55,270
All of a sudden I just, just got knocked out.

239
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,909
A few hours later we heard shooting we
didn"t know what it was

239
00:33:04,602 --> 00:33:08,541
It went on for about half an hour.

240
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,159
Then, all of a sudden, it went quiet.

241
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,397
Next time I woke up there was all light
inside the container.

242
00:33:31,106 --> 00:33:36,679
And then I noticed there was a body
next to me, there's a body underneath me.


244
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:39,114
It was wet and really cold.

246
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,595
And I had a, had a cloth.I ripped the cloth
and I start..

247
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,913
...wiping the water off and just squeezing it
and drinking it.

247
00:34:09,963 --> 00:34:11,963
Check them.

247
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:14,352
Get up!

247
00:34:14,609 --> 00:34:16,609
Aquí está.

247
00:34:18,312 --> 00:34:20,312
Get up!

247
00:34:37,227 --> 00:34:39,227
He's dead.

247
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,127
Who's still alive?

247
00:34:41,227 --> 00:34:41,885
This one.

247
00:34:41,985 --> 00:34:43,985
Get up.

248
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,358
They were taking bodies
off the trucks, dead bodies...

249
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:57,354
...and throwing them on to a pile and
searching their pockets.

250
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:18,720
I didn't know what was happening. 
I was just like a zombie.

251
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,914
Asif.

252
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,833
You could smell the stench of, like,
it was death you could smell on him.

253
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,712
Are you all right?

253
00:35:32,806 --> 00:35:34,140
Is Asif okay?

253
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,376
He's got a bullet wound.

254
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,758
Sheberghan Prison, Northern Afghanistan.

255
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:44,599
Hundreds of Afghan and foreign fighters are
being held here...

256
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,910
...in extremely over-crowded conditions.

257
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:50,072
These Taliban fighters are 
presume highly dangerous...

258
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,357
...after the recent riots
in nearby Kalajangi prison...

259
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,312
...where several hundred
Taliban prisoners...

260
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,835
...over-powered their 
Northern Alliance guards.

261
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,315
You'd go for days without food or water.

262
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:05,034
- The bread's here. The bread's here.
- Bread!

263
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:13,354
- I've got some,man. 
- Give me some!

264
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:17,830
- Give some to Asif. 
- Yeah, I got it, I got it.

265
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:24,433
At night it was so crowded that we had to
take turns in sleeping.

266
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:29,309
Once the Red Cross came, 
things started getting better.

267
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:42,838
- Where are you from? 
- I'm from Pakistan.

268
00:36:43,080 --> 00:36:45,640
In the prison everyone told us 
"Just don't say you're British".

269
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:48,189
- Ah, What's your name? 
- Ramesh.

270
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,433
- Ruhel? Where are you from?
- I'm from Pakistan.

270
00:36:52,615 --> 00:36:54,615
Give us one.

271
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,469
(Asif) Here, man.

272
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:58,793
Can I have one, please?

273
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,398
- i think We should tell the journalist man our story.
- Fucking sell him it, you know.

274
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:18,031
Just stick to the story. 
We're from Pakistan. Then we'll get home quicker.

275
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,513
Who speaks English?

276
00:37:32,015 --> 00:37:32,750
What?

277
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:33,934
English?

278
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,237
He needs a person who can speak English.

278
00:37:36,043 --> 00:37:38,043
English.
-Do you speak English? come quickly.

279
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,434
- You want to go? Be careful, huh?
- Probably get free.

280
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,279
What is your name?

281
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,834
Ruhel Ahmed.

282
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:01,299
Age?

282
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:02,752
Twenty.

283
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,713
- Where are you from? 
- I'm from Tipton.

284
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:09,390
- Where in fuck is Tipton?
- Tipton, Birmingham.

285
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,037
- Yeah, Tipton, England, yeah.
- You're from England? You asshole!

286
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:17,037
- What are you doing here? 
- Fuck, man...

287
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,635
- Answer me! 
- We come on a trip, man.

288
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:22,479
- Who's "we"? 
- Me and two of my mates.

289
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,478
Names. What are their names?

290
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,233
Come on!

291
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:31,358
Shafiq Rasul an Asif lqbal.

292
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,192
Okay, thank you.

293
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,829
Listen, you're in US custody now. It's okay.

294
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:38,355
- Take him away and search him.
- Search me?

295
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,989
Bring me Shafiq Rasul an Asif lqbal.

296
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,629
- Get up. 
- Why search me?

297
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,996
We're primarily looking at...

298
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:50,468
...detainees that we can use for collecting
intelligence.

299
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,278
Shafiq Rasul!

300
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:58,709
- Get out! 
- Move it.

301
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:06,112
Because you live in Britain, you got this thing about Americans, 
you think, "yeah, Americans, they're all right".

302
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,630
- Name? 
- Asif lqbal.

303
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,950
I thought, yeah, it's all right now...

304
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,755
...I mean, nothing's gonna happen.
well, I was wrong.

305
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,951
Where are you from?

306
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,759
From Pakistan.

307
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:22,117
Don't lie to me, Shafiq.
Where are you from?

308
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,200
From Pakistan, Karachi.

309
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,908
Don't fucking lie to me!

310
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,078
One more time now. Where are you from?

311
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,590
I live in England, but I came from Pakistan.

312
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:39,273
- Ah Okay. 
- Came here from Pakistan.

313
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,635
Sit up straight!

314
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,396
Put your legs out!

315
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,431
- What the fuck's going on here, mate?
- Shut up! Shut up!

316
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:55,358
I thought they were gonna hang us.

316
00:40:13,532 --> 00:40:16,252
KANDAHAR - AFGHANISTAN

317
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:24,671
-Up, move it!

318
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,033
You, you, you...

319
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,159
Keep your head bent own.

320
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:36,517
In a single file line. 
Straight in front of you.

321
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:49,511
Keep your heads bent down!

322
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,312
When the guy was searching me, he threw
me to the floor, he was kicking me at the same time.

323
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:56,876
Keep your heads down!

324
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:59,873
You, you, you, you, you, up, up!

325
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,271
Move them over there.

326
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:04,912
Keep it moving now. Move it, move it!

327
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,959
Get up!

328
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,630
- Move it! 
- Move, get up, get up!

329
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,478
Come on!

330
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:18,634
- Up, up, up, up.

331
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,553
- Come on.

332
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:23,950
Fucking move! Move it!

333
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,358
Come on, move!

334
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,272
Put your legs down.

335
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,351
I'll break your fucking arm!

336
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,317
I'll break your fucking arm!

336
00:41:37,353 --> 00:41:39,175
Back of the yard!

336
00:41:39,275 --> 00:41:41,275
Now!

337
00:41:43,400 --> 00:41:45,595
Okay, folks, show's over.

338
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,110
Here are your clothes.

339
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,075
Come on!

340
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:54,598
Don't move. Don't move!

341
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,796
Look, look at me, look at me.
See over there?

342
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:00,231
If you move, he's gonna blow your fucking
head off! Don't move!

343
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,396
Don't move!

344
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,193
Kanahar Airbase in southern Afghanistan.

345
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:16,632
It's now a prison for some of Al Queda's
most dangerous fighters.

346
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:21,118
I think we're now down to sorting out the
really bad guys...

347
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:25,512
...so our guard is up, the Marines are ready
for anything.

348
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,634
- Get those prisoners up and back. 
- Yes, sir.

349
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,633
We weren't allowed to talk, 
we weren't allowed to walk...

350
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,519
...you know, you couldn't look up at the
soldiers.

351
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,830
Stand up, that's right.

352
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:46,071
Come here, come here.

353
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,958
Show me your hands.

354
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,394
Prisoner 78! 78!

355
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:57,154
Get back, all the way back. 
You know the drill. Go all the way.

356
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:00,832
- Turn around!
- Face away from us, face away!

357
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,314
Go, go, go!

358
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,078
Get him up!

359
00:43:18,040 --> 00:43:19,268
Put him on his knees.

360
00:43:20,080 --> 00:43:22,594
Get on your knees. On your knees,
there you go.

361
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:24,911
Private, straighten him up.

362
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:25,876
Yes, sir.

363
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:28,270
Take the bag off his head.

364
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:31,873
Thank you.

365
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:34,190
Can you see me? 
Can you see him?

366
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:35,436
See me?

367
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,870
If you move, he'll shoot you.

368
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,719
Thank you, Private.

369
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,235
- What's your name? 
- Shafiq Rasul.

370
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,476
and, er, What's your date of birth?

371
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,154
15th April, 1977.

372
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,759
April, okay.

373
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,230
Who were you travelling with to Pakistan?

374
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,519
I was with my friends, 
one of them was getting married.

375
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,230
And they're here as well. 
Apart from one of them got lost in Kunduz.

376
00:43:58,480 --> 00:44:01,790
Because he got on one of the earlier
convoys to leave.

377
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:03,792
One of the ones that got bombed.

378
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:05,996
You mean he's dead?

379
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,353
I think so.

380
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,868
- What's his name?
- Monir.

381
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,831
- Everyone get back! 
- Get back!

382
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,270
Three, two, one. Stay where you are!

383
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:23,272
- Get back in position. 
- Everyone back!

384
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,391
It was hot in the day and 
it was freezing in the night.

385
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,471
You want one?

386
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:46,870
- Not you! Get back! 
- Over here, man.

387
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,868
- Over here, man. 
- Hey! Over there, go on, get back!

388
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:51,712
Get back. Get back!

389
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,110
You, you. You, you...

390
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,198
Back, back, back, back!

391
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:06,274
Every hour they'd wake us up...

392
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,948
...make us stand in a line and they'd take
everyone's numbers.

393
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,356
Head count, everybody up!

394
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:15,230
Let's see your wristbands, hold them up,
let's see your number.

395
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:20,632
72, 10, 79, 60...

396
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,874
...21, 147, 207...

397
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:28,317
...28, 15, 91...

398
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,391
Move it, go, go.

399
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:33,077
What the fuck, man.

400
00:45:56,560 --> 00:46:00,030
If you move I will shoot you, 
you understand?

401
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,793
Yeah, yeah.

402
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:06,877
- You want some of this?
- Yeah, I wouldn't mind.

403
00:46:07,640 --> 00:46:09,358
Because you can have as much 
as you want.

404
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,030
More than you could possibly eat.

405
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:15,355
If you tell us what the other 
people are saying.

406
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,079
What do you wanna know?

407
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:22,072
Well, let's start with, er, absolutely anything.

408
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:24,589
But I don't speak the language now, do I?

409
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,834
- What do you talk? 
- I talk Bengali.

410
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:31,072
- And them? 
- I don't know. Urdu, Arabic...

411
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:34,158
...something. I don't know. 
- You know what I think?

412
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:39,073
I think you're full of shit! You've been
hanging out with these guys how long?

413
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:42,118
You don't understand one god-damn word?

414
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,392
Well, do you?

415
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,995
Get back! Get up!

416
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:49,834
- Move yourself! 
- On your knees, get down!

417
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,435
Down, face down! Down!

418
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,790
Head down.

419
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,234
Go!

420
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:58,993
Fuck you.

421
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:04,632
If you looked at a guard right,what do they do...
they point...they- they always like to do this ...

422
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,673
...they point at you, in your eyes, 
and say 'look down'...

423
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,751
Used to do it with the hands
all the time.

424
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,916
And if you looked at them, basically,
that was it, you'd get punished.

425
00:47:12,822 --> 00:47:15,495
Hey, you, get your ass down!

425
00:47:21,264 --> 00:47:22,642
You are Al-Queda.

425
00:47:22,742 --> 00:47:24,742
No.

426
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:26,792
Pick that motherfucker up.

427
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,672
Look at me.

428
00:47:28,902 --> 00:47:30,100
You are Al-Queda.

429
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,551
- You're Al Queda. 
- No, I'm not.

430
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,716
Listen, you motherfucker.

430
00:47:44,694 --> 00:47:48,120
Do you know this can stop whenever 
you make the decision..

431
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,758
it can stop or it could go all night, okay?

432
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,316
We could be here all night, we could be
here all day tomorrow.

433
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:54,913
All right, you're Al Queda

434
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:57,429
We've got you with the Taliban.

435
00:47:57,720 --> 00:48:00,314
You were arrested by the Northern Alliance.

436
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,160
All right? 
Now, I wanna know where Bin Laden is.

437
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:06,437
Look at me. Where's Bin Laden?

438
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,228
I don't know. I ain't got a clue.

439
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:12,709
Pick him up.

440
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,230
When he was punching me, 
I was getting knocked to the floor.

441
00:48:15,299 --> 00:48:19,400
and when i come back, my face all bruised up.

442
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,470
...7, 8, 9...

443
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,472
...10, 11, 12...

444
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,029
...13, 14, 15, 16...

445
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,436
...17, 18, 19, 20...

445
00:48:39,819 --> 00:48:42,718
The people that were already there had Korans

446
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:47,154
Shake down! Move it! Everybody up!

447
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,469
Get up!

448
00:48:58,240 --> 00:49:00,708
Look underneath their clothes over there.

449
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,754
They'd grab them and throw them 
where we used to urinate.

450
00:49:07,840 --> 00:49:11,594
Fuck, man.

451
00:49:11,680 --> 00:49:14,353
Gotta do it faster. Trying to beat a minute
thirty. Come on, we can do it.

452
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,397
Move, move, move...

453
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:25,960
Give him a chair, sit him on a chair..

454
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,597
Yeah, uncuff him at the back, cuff him at
the front.

454
00:49:34,793 --> 00:49:36,793
Take this.

454
00:49:44,012 --> 00:49:45,420
So Asif.

455
00:49:45,421 --> 00:49:47,955
Surprised to hear another British voice?

456
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,394
Yes.

457
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,380
That's quite a long way from home, is it?

459
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:58,517
But the difference between you and me is I
can explain why I'm here.

460
00:49:58,840 --> 00:50:02,594
You, however, seem to have a little more
difficulty doing that.

461
00:50:04,240 --> 00:50:06,151
So, shall we start at the beginning?

462
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,635
Everything all right?

463
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,354
I've got your police record here 
and I've got Asif's police records here.

464
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,199
If you don't believe me, 
look at these, these are forms from Interpol.

465
00:50:32,520 --> 00:50:33,714
So?

466
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:36,993
So, I just want to clarify that I'm not
bullshitting you.

467
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,431
And I don't want you to bullshit me 
lt's gonna make both our lives a lot easier

468
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:43,950
Let's just have a look at your police record, shall we?

469
00:50:44,520 --> 00:50:46,351
Fraud, deception...

470
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,790
...handling stolen goods, violent disorder.

471
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,589
- Yeah, but we weren't charged for it.
- But those facts are true then?
- yeah

471
00:50:53,194 --> 00:50:54,920
- So I'm not bull shitting you?
- No.

472
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,388
So you wanna tell me what you were 
doing at Finsbury Park mosque?

473
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,600
I'm nowhere near there, 
I don't know what you're on about!
i wasn't in Finsbury Park Mosque

474
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,080
Perhaps you wanna tell me about how you
become a member of Al-Muhadschirun?

475
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,557
Who?

476
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,592
Get up.

477
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,950
Sit him in a chair..

478
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,597
Are you surprised to hear that 16 hours...

479
00:51:23,840 --> 00:51:25,831
...after you left England, 
your home was raided?

480
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,954
- That's bullshit. 
- No, no, it's not bullshit.

481
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,077
It's the truth.

482
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:35,437
Is it bullshit that you've attended
Birmingham Central Mosque?

483
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,591
No, I've been there.

484
00:51:39,352 --> 00:51:42,984
is it bullshit that you got into a coach 
and went to a march in London?

485
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:45,708
Does that ring true with you?

486
00:51:46,138 --> 00:51:48,880
i find that very hard to believe.

487
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:52,839
I don't supposed you get a lot of news of back
home. Of what's going on.

488
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,913
I'm gonna show you something, it's a little
treat for you.

489
00:51:56,760 --> 00:51:58,591
Have a look at this.

490
00:51:58,654 --> 00:52:02,616
These are copies of papers from the HOME office

490
00:52:02,716 --> 00:52:06,474
See that? INTERPOL, HOME office

492
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:11,151
This is a new law that our Government has
just drawn up...

493
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,637
...allowing the authorities to deport any
families...

494
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:19,190
...with any connection to terrorist cells or
terrorist organisations.

495
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,799
Do you understand the implications of that
for you and your family?

496
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:28,631
Your sister's at Exeter University, isn't she?

497
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:34,071
I wonder how easy it'd be to continue her
university course in Pakistan?

498
00:52:38,003 --> 00:52:40,718
You see how serious this is?

499
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:42,879
78!

500
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:46,553
78! Move it, now!

501
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:48,669
Up!

502
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:52,308
Here, move it!

503
00:52:52,560 --> 00:52:54,391
Hands on your head!

504
00:52:58,360 --> 00:52:59,952
- Don't move. 
- Don't you fucking move!

505
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,196
Up, up. Move it, come on!

506
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,908
Come on, come on.
Move it, move it, move it.

507
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,996
On your knees! On your knees!

508
00:53:09,240 --> 00:53:11,595
Lie down. Put your legs out!

509
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:17,353
Come on.

510
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,671
This isn't a stroll in the park. 
Run, you camel jockey, come on!

511
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,313
That's it, go on, run, you little bastard...

512
00:53:40,520 --> 00:53:42,556
Take the bag off.

513
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:45,434
Move it. What are you? Scared?

514
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,270
Take the bag off.

515
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:54,877
Stand still.

516
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,030
All right, keep moving.

517
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:18,832
Keep the pace up, fuckhead!

518
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:31,111
13 JANUARY 2002

519
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:52,193
More Al Queda and Taliban prisoners
arriving today in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.

520
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,356
Despite international criticism...

521
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:58,752
America insists that the conditions inside
Camp X-Ray are humane.

522
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,515
The fact remains the treatment is proper
and there's no doubt in my mind...

523
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:05,399
...that it is humane and appropriate...

524
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:09,076
...and consistent with the Geneva
Convention for the most part.

525
00:55:10,720 --> 00:55:13,917
Remember, the ones in Guantanamo Bay
are killers.

526
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:15,949
...they're...

527
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:19,873
...they don't share the same Values we
share.

528
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:23,112
On his knees, facing this way.

529
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:25,959
Knees down.

530
00:55:27,880 --> 00:55:31,634
- Third pole. 
- Don't let him look. Don't let him look.

531
00:55:35,120 --> 00:55:38,078
You're now the property of the U.S. Marine
Corp!

532
00:55:38,560 --> 00:55:41,028
This is your final destination.

533
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:44,149
Down.

534
00:55:44,920 --> 00:55:47,832
- Keep your fucking head down! 
- Get your legs crossed.

535
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:49,798
We were sitting like this on our knees...

536
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:55,114
...for ages. It was a really hot day, you
could feel the sun burning your head.

537
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:57,431
Down. Down!

538
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,950
Don't let him come up that far.

539
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,036
Hey, get a medic!

540
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:16,630
Get up. Take him out of here.

541
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:22,078
Let's go.

542
00:56:24,040 --> 00:56:25,917
Shut the fuck up!

543
00:56:29,080 --> 00:56:31,230
My eyes are stinging!

544
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:36,715
Whats that pussy-boy? You got something to say? 
Are you the fucking Brit?

545
00:56:36,960 --> 00:56:39,110
Fucking Brit traitor.

546
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:43,679
Get on your knees! Get on your fucking
knees. I'm not doing it for you.

547
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:54,999
Go. Move!

548
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,437
Get away from the fence.
Get away from the wall.

549
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,231
Get off the fence.

550
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:13,795
That's Your piss bucket, that's your drinking water, right, 
Stay off the fucking fence.

551
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:16,159
Shut up!

552
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:30,800
Shut the fuck up!

553
00:57:35,480 --> 00:57:39,553
For the first month and a half we never
went out of our cells.

554
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,990
What the fuck are you doing?

555
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,040
- Take it down. 
- I'm just putting up some shade.

556
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,713
now, take it down now!
Just sit down and be quiet.

557
00:57:47,920 --> 00:57:52,516
You speak English. 
For Christ's sake, you should know the rules by now.

558
00:57:56,600 --> 00:58:00,354
They wouldn't let us pray. 
You couldn't stand up in your cell.

559
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:06,479
For the first two weeks we weren't allowed
to speak to the guy next to us.

560
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,196
- You all right, man? 
- Shut up. No talking.

561
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:46,392
You know the guy who wears the yellow suit?

562
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:57,234
Hey, fuckstick! Quit praying!

563
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:00,068
Hey! Stop praying!

564
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:03,312
- Wait right there. 
- They called it 'Extreme reaction force

565
00:59:03,560 --> 00:59:07,439
It's five soldiers in riot gear who come into
your cell.

566
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:09,910
Their job is to secure you.

567
00:59:14,240 --> 00:59:16,151
- Take him out. - Go, go, go!

568
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,433
That's it.

569
00:59:28,360 --> 00:59:30,157
No talking!

570
00:59:32,560 --> 00:59:35,313
...take that towel off your head. Now!

571
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:38,277
Go. Back of the cell, now.

572
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:45,758
Don't move.

573
00:59:47,080 --> 00:59:48,957
Come on, move.

574
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,992
What is your name?

575
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:56,198
Asif...Asif lqubal.

576
00:59:56,440 --> 00:59:59,352
- And where you from, Asif? 
- Tipton.

577
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:01,397
I'm from the British Embassy.

578
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,477
How are you?

579
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,035
I don't want to know about
your emotional state.

580
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:14,873
I want to know about the state of your
health.

581
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,716
- What were you doing in Afghanistan?
- Went to get married.

582
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,753
Your friend in Afghanistan...

583
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,389
...has alreay told us you went there for
Jihad.

584
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:33,230
- Tell us the truth, you can go home.
- I'm telling you the truth.

585
01:00:33,400 --> 01:00:35,311
I never went for no Jihad.

586
01:00:35,560 --> 01:00:38,154
I left Tipton to get married.

587
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:40,795
My dad's in Pakistan, you can ask him,
he's waiting for me.

588
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:43,548
Your friends have told us you were there on
a Jihad.

589
01:00:43,760 --> 01:00:45,193
What friend?

590
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,596
How did you end up in Afghanistan?

591
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,116
I can't prove anything...

592
01:00:50,320 --> 01:00:52,959
...and you're not gonna believe me, so...

593
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:55,510
...I'm not gonna say anything else.

594
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,838
Watch it, don't bite you. Look at you,

595
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,752


596
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,869
Stop fucking about, man.

597
01:01:27,440 --> 01:01:31,592
Okay, I'm from Ml5 in England. We're here to ask
you some questions and to help, okay?

598
01:01:31,714 --> 01:01:33,960
...answer my questions the best that you can and we'll do...

599
01:01:33,960 --> 01:01:35,598
...what we can and get you out of here as soon
as we can.

600
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:38,996
Do you know any whereabouts of my mates
Asif and Shaf?

601
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,949
Are these the two friends of yours you
arrived in the country with?

602
01:01:43,520 --> 01:01:46,637
Your two friends, people you describe as
friends...

603
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,877
...have reportedly said that...

604
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,153
...you're with Al Queda. 
- That's bullshit, that is.

605
01:01:52,440 --> 01:01:53,919
so your comment on it?

606
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:56,793
- I don't think you're telling the truth. 
- No, I'm just asking you some questions.

607
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,086
- I thought you were here to help me?
- I'm trying my best to.

608
01:01:59,086 --> 01:02:04,335
you have no reasons to understand 
why your 2 friends would 
say you were linked to Al-Qaeda?

608
01:02:04,560 --> 01:02:06,949
I think that's bullshit what 
you're telling me right there.

609
01:02:06,972 --> 01:02:11,160
How can you imagine that we accused you...
u think of a reason why they would say that about you.

610
01:02:11,161 --> 01:02:14,771
That's the thing, I don't even think they 
have talked and said that about me.

611
01:02:29,600 --> 01:02:31,795
On your knees... Move it!

612
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:38,471
How's it going?

613
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,359
You okay?

614
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,875
- My name's Ruhel. 
- Ruhel?

615
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:44,639
Do you speak Urdu?

616
01:02:44,880 --> 01:02:46,518
- Me? No. 
- No talking!

617
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:48,955
Are you all right?

618
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:53,789
- How long have you been here?
- hey, Cut that out. No talking.

619
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:36,163
I thought I was in a zoo.

620
01:03:38,261 --> 01:03:41,280
I mean, that's what it reminded me of, was
a proper zoo.

621
01:03:49,691 --> 01:03:51,645
What the hell are you doing?

622
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:53,188
Hey.

623
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:57,205
What are you doing?
You're praying like a Muslim?

624
01:03:57,205 --> 01:03:59,753
What the hell are you doing?
I thought you were a Brit.

625
01:03:59,753 --> 01:04:02,310
What about your Queen?

626
01:04:05,230 --> 01:04:08,983
186 captives are now
in Guantanamo Bay...

627
01:04:08,983 --> 01:04:13,040
being question in these wooden huts by CIA,

628
01:04:13,040 --> 01:04:15,674
...FBI and military interrogators.

629
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:18,636
I guess you wanna be in these fucking
things forever.

630
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:20,870
That's what you wanna be? Do you wanna
be in here for fucking ever?

631
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,798
Don't get fucking smart with me, boy!

632
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,396
You're gonna tell me right now, you gonna tell me the truth 
Huh?

633
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,231
You gonna tell me?

634
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,637
- Did you say you were a fighter? 
- No.

635
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,555
I thought I fucking heard it!

636
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,195
Don't waste my time.

637
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:46,110
It either destroys you or it makes you
stronger. I think it made me stronger.

638
01:04:46,280 --> 01:04:49,716
It destroyed me for a few weeks. 
After that I was all right.

639
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:54,431
Dr Dre, Eminem, Tupac. 
Do you know them?

640
01:05:02,440 --> 01:05:04,556
Do you know them?

641
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:07,553
- Say, rude boy... 
- Say, rude boy...

642
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:09,671
-...better watch your back.
-...better watch your back.

643
01:05:09,920 --> 01:05:12,309
-The man them are back.
-The man them are back.

644
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:15,154
-...with the wicked chat.
-...with the wicked chat.

645
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,993
Don't watch how the lyrics attack.

646
01:05:18,200 --> 01:05:19,553
No.

647
01:05:36,120 --> 01:05:37,951
Still awake?

648
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:42,074
Why don't you give me one of these raps I
hear you teaching these guys?

649
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:45,869
- What do you wanna hear me rap about?
- I don't care, man. Anything.

650
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,876
All right, listen, yeah.

651
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:51,991
Ah, listen up, my name's Shafiq Rasul and
I'm from Tipton.

652
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,152
I tell 'em I ain't Taliban, but they don't
wanna listen.

653
01:05:55,400 --> 01:05:58,631
You won't believe I just came out here for
my mate's wedding, do ya?

654
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:01,029
I never thought my arse would be 
heading for Cuba.

655
01:06:01,080 --> 01:06:04,200
And in between, I've been through mad
different shit you couldn't handle

656
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:06,714
...but the worst is having them shackles
slicing up your ankles.

657
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,274
And, yo, between me and you, these guards
are retards.

658
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,159
See him on his knees, they think he's
praying to the Queen...

659
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:14,709
All right, all right, that's enough.

660
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:18,998
Thanks, anyways. Get some sleep.

661
01:06:34,280 --> 01:06:36,157
Hey, sit down.

662
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:39,029
- No walking around. 
- How come?

663
01:06:39,160 --> 01:06:41,594
No exercising. You know the rules.

664
01:06:51,320 --> 01:06:55,108
In Camp X-Ray, we used to walk five
minutes every week.

665
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:57,475
They used to take us out for five minutes.

666
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,277
Move it! Come on!

667
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:05,318
You, let's go. 
Back of the cell, hands on your head. 
Come on.

668
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:07,038
Come on, move it, move it.

669
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:18,569
We found a file in a cave in Afghanistan,
says you're linked to Al Queda.

670
01:08:18,669 --> 01:08:19,671
That's bullshit.

671
01:08:19,771 --> 01:08:22,340
- We found your brother's file as well.
- That is bullshit.

672
01:08:22,440 --> 01:08:24,165
And we also found your passport.

673
01:08:24,265 --> 01:08:28,087
- No, you didn't. It's in my uncle's house.
- No, we found your passport there.

674
01:08:28,187 --> 01:08:30,327
You know you're quite famous?

675
01:08:31,708 --> 01:08:35,475
I put your name into the Internet...

676
01:08:35,575 --> 01:08:38,520
...I got thirteen thousands hits.

677
01:08:39,576 --> 01:08:44,846
Very unlikely... he was guilty of fighting in
Afghanistan.

678
01:08:44,881 --> 01:08:45,451
"Keener on fashion than religion."

679
01:08:52,917 --> 01:08:55,424
What's wrong?

680
01:08:59,892 --> 01:09:02,886
My nephew's died.

681
01:09:02,986 --> 01:09:05,066
You mean, this is the first you've heard?

682
01:09:05,604 --> 01:09:08,492
I'm not answering any more 
questions to you.

683
01:09:10,494 --> 01:09:12,522
What was his name?

684
01:09:25,130 --> 01:09:28,861
Hey... keep the blanket off.
I need to see your hands.

685
01:09:29,596 --> 01:09:31,460
Bitch!

686
01:09:31,699 --> 01:09:33,000
Hey, bitch.

687
01:09:33,099 --> 01:09:37,516
Hey, sit down! Shut the fuck up!

689
01:09:39,794 --> 01:09:41,379
- Hey, bitch. 
- Stupid motherfucker!

690
01:09:43,855 --> 01:09:46,918
Sit the fuck down! Shut the fuck up!

691
01:09:48,253 --> 01:09:50,330
I'll shove this up your ass!

692
01:09:50,798 --> 01:09:52,614
You stupid motherfucker, sit down!

693
01:09:52,700 --> 01:09:55,000
- Come here, bitch! 
- Sit the fuck down!

694
01:09:55,559 --> 01:09:58,217
He's crazy, man, just leave him.

695
01:09:58,912 --> 01:10:00,997
- Sit the fuck down! 
- You shut up.
- You're fucking mother's a bitch.

697
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,756
He was mentally disturbed before he even
came to Cuba.

698
01:10:04,756 --> 01:10:07,154
And he used to shout at everyone all the
time.

699
01:10:08,628 --> 01:10:09,628
You've seen nothing yet, motherfucker.

700
01:10:12,436 --> 01:10:16,645
- Beat the shit out of him!
- Hold him down, hold him down!

701
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:25,000
He's mad okay, so just leave him!

702
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:28,248
Sit the fuck down, you'll be next,
motherfucker!

703
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:29,635
Fucking leave him!

704
01:10:29,700 --> 01:10:30,909
- Get him out!
- You're all fucking crazy monkeys...

705
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:36,033
- Get him the fuck out of here!
- Throw that shit on me, you're next!

706
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,714
Get this shit outta here!

707
01:10:49,931 --> 01:10:52,991
That's only a taste, motherfucker

708
01:10:56,819 --> 01:11:00,390
I've been told we haven't found 
your file in Afghanistan...

709
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:02,409
...it was someone else's.

710
01:11:02,509 --> 01:11:05,632
So, what were you doing in Afghanistan?

711
01:11:10,713 --> 01:11:13,537
Hey, you. Wake up.

712
01:11:13,637 --> 01:11:18,605
There were rats, mice, there was snakes, 
you know scorpions...

713
01:11:18,705 --> 01:11:20,895
Man, don't move.

714
01:11:21,519 --> 01:11:23,650
Wake up. Don't move,
Don't move, I'm coming in.

715
01:11:23,750 --> 01:11:25,130
- Don't move, I'm coming in. - Fuck.

716
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:28,082
Don't move.

717
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:33,200
Fucking hell!

718
01:11:33,255 --> 01:11:35,600
It's dead, it's dead.

719
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:37,533
- It's a big bastard, man. - Yes, it is.

720
01:11:39,738 --> 01:11:43,764
- Fucking hell!
- Okay. Go back to sleep, it's all good now.

721
01:11:43,864 --> 01:11:45,864
- Yeah, well, thanks a lot, man.
- Yeah, all right. No problem.

722
01:11:46,351 --> 01:11:49,003
All right, everybody,
show's over, get back to sleep.

723
01:11:49,103 --> 01:11:52,476
Asif and Shafiq were kept in Camp X-Ray for three months.

724
01:11:52,576 --> 01:11:54,862
Ruhel Spent six weeks there.

725
01:12:02,184 --> 01:12:04,184
No talking

726
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:06,960
The US Government announce today that
prisoners...

727
01:12:07,060 --> 01:12:10,588
...are being transferred to a new 
purpose built facility...

728
01:12:10,688 --> 01:12:13,530
...in Guantanamo Bay, named Camp Delta.

729
01:12:29,784 --> 01:12:31,555
Put him in cell 11.

730
01:12:31,603 --> 01:12:33,583
Were you a member of Al Queda?

731
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,051
No.

732
01:12:36,728 --> 01:12:39,116
How long were you in Afghanistan?

733
01:12:41,151 --> 01:12:43,521
You know I can speak English, yeah?

734
01:12:43,871 --> 01:12:46,752
- I'm British. 
- You speak English, you don't need a translator?

735
01:12:47,509 --> 01:12:49,395
Are you a good Muslim?

736
01:12:53,036 --> 01:12:54,441
I try to be.

737
01:12:55,036 --> 01:12:55,441
Sit down, shut up.

738
01:12:58,604 --> 01:13:01,773
We were in Delta for about a month and
then Ruhel arrived.

739
01:13:02,829 --> 01:13:06,544
- Ruhel! 
- Oh No, Oh No!

740
01:13:08,943 --> 01:13:10,547
- What are you saying, man?
- Two fuckers! - Where the fuck were you,
you fuckface?

742
01:13:12,061 --> 01:13:14,048
Fucking hell, you lot got a five star here.

743
01:13:14,103 --> 01:13:16,713
- They'd still have you in the dog kennel.
- You fucker.

744
01:13:17,870 --> 01:13:20,377
Keep it down, keep it down.

745
01:13:22,249 --> 01:13:24,413
Oh, no, like toothbrush. fucking hell.

746
01:13:25,179 --> 01:13:27,714
We were in Camp Delta for about a year
an nothing happened.

747
01:13:27,814 --> 01:13:35,100
Just the same questions over an over
again, and then it all changed.

748
01:13:35,292 --> 01:13:37,731
I wanna show you something.

749
01:13:42,158 --> 01:13:46,464
You said you were wearing an Adidas
tracksuit?

750
01:13:46,564 --> 01:13:48,137
Adidas tracksuit bottoms, yeah.

750
01:13:48,237 --> 01:13:50,237
That's not what you said.

750
01:13:50,289 --> 01:13:52,289
Why, what is this?

751
01:13:53,106 --> 01:13:56,490
This is your friend Asif lqbal...

752
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:58,853
Who? No, it isn't.

753
01:13:59,171 --> 01:14:02,540
This is you, in your Adidias tracksuit.

755
01:14:02,640 --> 01:14:08,152
that ain't me, man. I've never worn an Adidas Tracksuits, 
I've told you, I wore Adidas bottoms.

756
01:14:09,764 --> 01:14:11,624
That's not what you said.

757
01:14:11,724 --> 01:14:14,855
Recognise him? Mohamed Allah?

758
01:14:15,307 --> 01:14:17,307
Who is that?

759
01:14:17,462 --> 01:14:19,927
He headed the 9/11 attacks.

760
01:14:19,948 --> 01:14:19,700
This is you.

762
01:14:19,948 --> 01:14:23,700
- This is you... right?
- its not me... I've told you...

763
01:14:23,730 --> 01:14:30,437
This is you at a rally in Afghanistan held by Osama
Bin Laden, right?

764
01:14:30,537 --> 01:14:35,812
I told you, that's a fucking good picture but
that ain't me...becos that ain't me...

766
01:14:39,502 --> 01:14:41,502
Cell seven.

767
01:14:49,203 --> 01:14:51,413
Where the fuck did you go for so long?

768
01:14:54,877 --> 01:14:57,632
You must be Shafiq Rasul.

769
01:14:59,685 --> 01:15:02,238
I've come from Washington.

770
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:10,322
This is a rally In Afghanistan.

771
01:15:10,422 --> 01:15:12,332
Do you remember being here?

772
01:15:12,432 --> 01:15:17,531
Watch closely, I want you to tell me 
if you recognise anybody here

773
01:15:19,064 --> 01:15:21,064
This is Osama Bin Laden.

774
01:15:21,348 --> 01:15:23,504
He's addressing the rally.

775
01:15:23,604 --> 01:15:26,601
These people sitting here, you recognised
any of them?

776
01:15:26,701 --> 01:15:30,530
Asif...Ruhel, you...

777
01:15:32,738 --> 01:15:36,164
That says 2000 here. 2000, Is that the date?

778
01:15:36,264 --> 01:15:37,570
That's what is says.

779
01:15:37,670 --> 01:15:39,711
I wasn't even in Afghanistan in 2000.

780
01:15:39,811 --> 01:15:43,425
1st of August - - I was working in Currys.

781
01:15:43,525 --> 01:15:45,618
I was working at Currys all through the summer.

782
01:15:45,718 --> 01:15:49,813
It may not be 1st of August, 
it may be January 8th.

783
01:15:49,913 --> 01:15:53,534
It doesn't matter, I was working at Currys
throughout the whole of 2000. 
I wasn't even in Afghanistan.

784
01:15:53,634 --> 01:16:00,205
I can see you on the tape in Afghanistan... in 2000

785
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:01,672
How can it be me if I wasn't 
even in the country?

786
01:16:01,772 --> 01:16:06,043
because I can see you on a Video with 
your friends Ruhel and Asif...

787
01:16:06,143 --> 01:16:11,197
...listening to Osama Bin Laden in
Afghanistan.

788
01:16:11,297 --> 01:16:14,500
The woman who was in there said to me and...

789
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:18,913
..."We've put people in isolation for years
and eventually they break".

789
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:27,701
I was there about 3, 3 and a half months.

790
01:16:41,174 --> 01:16:43,174
Stand up.

791
01:16:43,335 --> 01:16:45,335
Stick your arms through.

792
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,335
Have a nice day.

793
01:17:00,288 --> 01:17:02,288
Ruhel?

794
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:04,535
- Who's that? 
- Is that you?

795
01:17:04,626 --> 01:17:06,788
- Asif? 
- Is that you?

796
01:17:06,800 --> 01:17:08,200
- What are you doing here? 
- You all right?

797
01:17:08,210 --> 01:17:10,888
Yeah, man... how are you?

798
01:17:10,888 --> 01:17:14,000
All right, man.

799
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,700
It was a whole different story for us now.

800
01:17:19,710 --> 01:17:24,420
It was like we were getting punished, then it
was nice for about two, three months.

801
01:17:30,500 --> 01:17:33,635
There's a hook on the floor... the leg irons
are attached to a hook.

802
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:35,718
Then they put your hands between your...

803
01:17:36,800 --> 01:17:41,351
...ankles at the floor and chain you to the
hook on the floor as well.

804
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:53,505
They keep you there for an hour...

805
01:17:53,566 --> 01:17:56,750
...sometimes two hours,
five hours, six hours.

806
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:06,100
You can't go to the toilet.

807
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:08,953
You have to urinate
and defecate where you are.

808
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:34,194
Help!

809
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,036
Hey, shut the fuck up!

810
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:39,871
Shut the fuck up, okay.

811
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,654
- Have a look at it,man. 
- Fuck off.

812
01:19:07,767 --> 01:19:11,403
Are you a faggot?
You can't handle this stuff?

813
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:13,420
Fucking knob.

814
01:19:13,425 --> 01:19:15,755
Why don't you just sit there and jack-off for
another four hours.

815
01:19:15,755 --> 01:19:17,289
- Do you drink water? 

815
01:19:17,289 --> 01:19:18,134
- Yes.

816
01:19:18,134 --> 01:19:20,805
- Are you a member of Al Queda? 
- No.

817
01:19:20,805 --> 01:19:23,591
- Have you met Osama Bin Laden? 
- No.

818
01:19:23,591 --> 01:19:25,916
- Did you fight with the Taliban? 
- No.

819
01:19:26,599 --> 01:19:29,339
I was put in a room with AC on

820
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:30,709
and then i was put in stress positions

820
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:40,879
Help!

821
01:19:41,462 --> 01:19:43,780
They wanted me to say I was a fighter.

822
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:47,965
Once I said that, the next thing is 
"You a member of Al Queda"?

823
01:19:47,966 --> 01:19:49,966
Once you say you're a member of Al Queda,

823
01:19:50,967 --> 01:19:52,167
that's it.

824
01:19:52,262 --> 01:19:59,560
- Did you say you were a fighter? 
- Yeah. Just get me out of here.
- No, you're fucking staying right there.

826
01:20:03,293 --> 01:20:06,834
Are you admitting to me that you are a
fucking fighter? Is that what you want?

827
01:20:06,834 --> 01:20:09,852
- Yes! - Yes! 
- You are a fighter?

828
01:20:13,357 --> 01:20:15,366
I said it was me.

829
01:20:17,957 --> 01:20:22,004
I said, "If I admit it, what will happen?"
He says, "You will go to Court".

830
01:20:22,005 --> 01:20:26,051
I said, "Give me a pen and paper, I'll write it down for you".
I said, "That's me in that photo and I was there".

832
01:20:35,492 --> 01:20:36,666
Hello, Asif.

833
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:44,808
Your case is gonna be taken to a Tribunal.

834
01:20:44,808 --> 01:20:47,878
- How do you feel about that? 
- That's good.

835
01:20:47,878 --> 01:20:49,761
- Excuse me? 
- I said, "that's good".

836
01:20:49,761 --> 01:20:52,404
that's good? Why do you say that?

837
01:20:52,404 --> 01:20:55,889
January I'm in England.
August I'm in England.

838
01:20:55,889 --> 01:20:59,414
It's not a problem,
I can proved I was in England.

839
01:20:59,414 --> 01:21:02,569
I'm not bullshitting you. Go and check it out.

840
01:21:03,574 --> 01:21:05,836
For me and Asif the police were our alibi.

841
01:21:07,746 --> 01:21:11,457
All that year I was doing Community Service and Probation.

842
01:21:11,457 --> 01:21:17,699
One was for Violent disorder...
and the Second one was for fraud and deception.

844
01:21:17,699 --> 01:21:21,724
So, even if it was January or August...

845
01:21:21,725 --> 01:21:25,749
...I was still covered because the whole
year I was in and out of Court and the police station..

846
01:21:26,830 --> 01:21:28,625
I have some letters for you.

847
01:21:30,327 --> 01:21:32,674
- I'll give them to the Americans to censor.
- Okay.

848
01:21:34,110 --> 01:21:36,439
I'm here about the Video.

849
01:21:36,439 --> 01:21:39,507
How many times do I have to answer these questions?

850
01:21:39,507 --> 01:21:43,434
If you're not here to help, I've got nothing to
say to you, just go.

851
01:21:43,434 --> 01:21:45,114
-i am here to help you. 

851
01:21:45,114 --> 01:21:47,853
- You came before, you did fuck all.

852
01:21:48,391 --> 01:21:49,933
I'm sorry.

853
01:21:51,701 --> 01:21:53,966
Fuck off, man.

854
01:21:54,451 --> 01:21:55,713
Just fuck off.

855
01:21:56,329 --> 01:21:58,707
- You guys fucked up. 
- What?

856
01:21:59,309 --> 01:22:02,947
You were belligerent and uncooperative.

857
01:22:03,792 --> 01:22:07,514
Where are my letters? 
They said they would give them to you.

858
01:22:07,514 --> 01:22:12,386
You're not gonna get your fucking letters back. 
You were uncooperative.

859
01:22:12,740 --> 01:22:14,949
Fuck off, man.

860
01:22:19,489 --> 01:22:24,080
After about three months, they dropped it.
They said, "Okay we made a grave mistake".

862
01:22:25,390 --> 01:22:28,887
Congratulations, you've been cleared.

863
01:22:31,217 --> 01:22:33,621
Then we were all taken out of isolation and
put together...

864
01:22:33,621 --> 01:22:36,849
...and we started being called 'The Three
Kings'...

865
01:22:36,849 --> 01:22:38,947
...because we used to get four meals,
double meals.

866
01:22:38,948 --> 01:22:42,449
Films every Sunday,
McDonald's, Pizza Hut...

867
01:22:47,114 --> 01:22:49,165
I want you to help us.

868
01:22:49,165 --> 01:22:51,435
I want you to come, work for us.

869
01:22:52,061 --> 01:22:55,230
If you work for us, I'll get you out of here in a
couple of weeks.

870
01:22:55,230 --> 01:22:59,855
Fuck that shit.
Working for you. Fuck off.

872
01:22:59,855 --> 01:23:05,756
Ruhel, Shafiq an Asif were kept in
Guantanamo for another 3 months.

873
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,554
- Hello, how are you? 
- Okay.

874
01:23:10,360 --> 01:23:13,918
How are you?

875
01:23:14,200 --> 01:23:16,219
I am well, thank you.

876
01:23:16,219 --> 01:23:20,339
They were still not allowed to see or speak to their family or lawyers.

877
01:23:30,085 --> 01:23:34,074
Sign this piece of paper saying that you
were detained in Guantanamo Bay...

878
01:23:34,075 --> 01:23:36,069
...because you were linked to 
Al Queda and the Taliban.

879
01:23:36,069 --> 01:23:37,328
No.

880
01:23:37,328 --> 01:23:38,643
Go fuck yourself.

881
01:23:38,643 --> 01:23:41,360
Fuck you, I ain't fucking signing that.

882
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:43,493
Then you're never going home.

883
01:23:50,694 --> 01:23:54,639
It was never confirmed. 
They never said "oh, It wasn't you".

884
01:23:54,640 --> 01:23:58,584
They never admitted to them being wrong.

885
01:23:59,474 --> 01:24:03,607
More than 750 people have been 
imprisoned in Guantanamo.

886
01:24:07,051 --> 01:24:14,663
It is estimate 500 are still there.
Only 10 have ever been charged.

888
01:24:18,661 --> 01:24:22,717
None have ever been found 
guilty of any crime.

889
01:24:22,718 --> 01:24:26,718
CAMP DELTA - JTF GUANTANAMO

890
01:24:26,898 --> 01:24:28,734


891
01:24:33,315 --> 01:24:35,733
hey, hey, Don't look out the window!

892
01:24:39,168 --> 01:24:43,354
Hey, princess... You hard of hearing?

893
01:24:43,355 --> 01:24:45,752
- What's your fucking problem? 
- Don't look out the fucking window.

894
01:24:45,752 --> 01:24:48,168
Do you want me to send you back?

895
01:24:48,169 --> 01:24:51,466
- Do you want me to send you right back?!
- Want you to send me back, yeah?.

896
01:24:51,466 --> 01:24:54,271
Boys, this one wants to send me back yeah!

897
01:24:57,466 --> 01:25:02,070
You know one thing? You can't send me back. 
You don't fucking own me!

898
01:25:02,070 --> 01:25:03,834
Move the camera, man.

899
01:25:03,870 --> 01:25:06,100
Fucking move the camera!

900
01:25:20,335 --> 01:25:23,537
British detainees arrived home today from
Guantanamo.

901
01:25:23,537 --> 01:25:25,965
They were flown by the RAF to Northolt
where they were taken...

902
01:25:25,965 --> 01:25:32,342
...by police to Puddington Green Station
before being released.

903
01:25:33,946 --> 01:25:36,046
<i> We went to a hotel. I got there first and I
was waiting there for about...</i>

904
01:25:36,047 --> 01:25:40,146
<i>...five, ten minutes, and then there was a
knock on the door. It was my dad.</i>

905
01:25:40,747 --> 01:25:42,747
<i>We just kinda hugged... 
Didn't really say anything.</i>

906
01:25:44,349 --> 01:25:47,072
<i>It's completely changed my life.</i>

907
01:25:47,072 --> 01:25:51,914
<i>The way i look at things,
the way i look at what's happening in the world</i>

908
01:25:52,332 --> 01:25:54,111
<i>The world's not a nice place.</i>

909
01:25:54,111 --> 01:25:58,145
<i>Looking back on it now, yes,
it was an experience.</i>

910
01:25:58,145 --> 01:26:02,719
<i>And it has change my life for the better, so
I don't really regret it.</i>

911
01:26:02,719 --> 01:26:07,384
<i>I haven't changed a great deal. Just that I
practice my religion more.</i>

912
01:26:07,684 --> 01:26:10,073
<i>I mean, I didn't even practice at all before.</i>

913
01:26:10,073 --> 01:26:14,149
<i>I think it's best for me to like...to move on with my life.</i>

915
01:26:15,406 --> 01:26:21,006
<i>To start stepping forward instead of looking
back. It's time to move on.</i>

916
01:26:32,910 --> 01:26:33,854
Same smell.

917
01:26:36,741 --> 01:26:37,857
It's amazing.

918
01:27:30,780 --> 01:27:34,045
Didn't he say if we went straight from
Lahore, we'd go a different way?

919
01:27:37,315 --> 01:27:40,667
Ask anyone and they'll tell you.

919
01:27:46,487 --> 01:27:48,205
Hello? Who's this?

919
01:27:54,492 --> 01:27:56,156
Is it getting hotter or is it me?

920
01:27:56,805 --> 01:28:01,900
We've reached our hotel in the town centre.

921
01:28:04,565 --> 01:28:07,734
Where's Merchung?

1053
01:28:07,734 --> 01:28:11,704
It's that way.

1054
01:28:11,896 --> 01:28:15,445
Keep going that way for Merchung.

921
01:28:21,951 --> 01:28:23,532
