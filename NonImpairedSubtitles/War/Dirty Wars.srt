being used that you found objectionable?

[Exhales] I did.

393
00:44:54,659 --> 00:45:00,530
There was... A lot of trepidation about...
What we were being

394
00:45:00,532 --> 00:45:08,532
asked to do, and where, and for what purpose.
A lot of it was of

395
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:16,245
questionable legality. And most of it
was outside of any stated battlefield.

396
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:21,818
Kinetic operations, whether it's capture
or kill, in some cases to detain,

399
00:45:32,163 --> 00:45:37,600
U.S. military forces, or even the central
intelligence agency. Because of the extreme secrecy

400
00:45:37,602 --> 00:45:45,602
surrounding the program, there was
a variety of abuses. >> Torture?

401
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:51,748
I would say that, yes. The president
has made a political and military

402
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:56,786
calculation to let the joint special
operations command run wild.

403
00:45:56,788 --> 00:46:00,056
Scahill: So you're saying j-soc is able to
hit harder under president Obama than they

404
00:46:00,058 --> 00:46:04,093
were under president bush. >> Harder,
faster, quicker, with the full support

Anwar was an all-American boy.

488
00:54:16,520 --> 00:54:24,520
This is in Disneyland, you know, in 1984, I think.
This is in San Diego when he was

489
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:29,598
already an <i>imam</i> with big beard, you know.
At that time he was asking

490
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:34,069
muslims to participate in the Democratic process in America.
In fact, during the presidential

491
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:40,142
campaign of George Bush, he thought the
conservative Republicans will be better than

492
00:54:40,144 --> 00:54:46,282
the liberal democrats, and he encouraged
the muslims there to elect George Bush.

493

Scahill: Didn't he even, at one point,

494
00:54:48,986 --> 00:54:54,290
Yes. You see, he liked America.
And he wanted to stay and

really-- his life in America. But things came differently.

497
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:14,977

over shabwah, so, you know, anwar was

498
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:22,718
really concerned, and so we took his family
with us and he left to the mountains.

replace, you know, the role of my
son as he was doing for his family.

502
00:55:46,410 --> 00:55:50,245
From my reading of the history of your
son, from his writing, it seemed as though

503
00:55:50,247 --> 00:55:54,950
there was a transformation that happened
politically for him, from 9/11 to the invasion of

504
00:55:54,952 --> 00:55:59,088
Iraq, something started to
change in his tone. >> Yes.

505
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:06,729
Anwar became popular before September 11 because
his sermons and his tapes, you know, were

506
00:56:06,731 --> 00:56:13,068
very popular all over the English-speaking world.
And then the invasion came in

507
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:21,070
2003 and they invaded Iraq and destroyed Iraq,
so anwar really started to be more vocal in his

508
00:56:23,447 --> 00:56:29,551
speeches against what the Americans were
doing against muslims all over the world.

509
00:56:29,553 --> 00:56:32,755
There's no doubt that your son praised some
of the attacks against the U.S. >> yes.

510
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:35,524
And for many Americans, it was enough
to say anwar Al-awlaki is a terrorist.

511
00:56:35,526 --> 00:56:41,663
But also I want decent American lawyer
to tell me that it is right for the united

512
00:56:41,665 --> 00:56:46,935
states government to kill an American citizen
on the basis that he said something against

513
00:56:46,937 --> 00:56:51,874
the United States or against American soldiers.
I mean, I don't understand.

514
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:57,446
I don't understand 100% the American constitution,
but I don't believe American law will

515
00:56:57,448 --> 00:57:02,351
allow the killing of an American citizen
because he says something against the united

516
00:57:02,353 --> 00:57:05,454
states.
