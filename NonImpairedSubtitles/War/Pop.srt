1
00:02:47,563 --> 00:02:51,365
Behold, the fly, such a shameless creature before the Lord.

2
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:54,006
Whilst me, a church figure,

3
00:02:54,766 --> 00:02:57,568
am deep within thoughts about our worthy staretz (headman)

4
00:02:57,647 --> 00:02:59,248
Zosima the Phoenician,

5
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:03,090
you dare to land on his wonderful icon...

6
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:06,332
you walk on him with your shameless legs,

7
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:09,533
you "wash" yourself there; Lord, forgive me.

8
00:03:16,935 --> 00:03:20,456
This is me, unable to kill a fly, people say about me.

9
00:03:22,376 --> 00:03:24,737
- Who are you speaking with?
- I'm speaking to a fly.

10
00:03:24,816 --> 00:03:26,658
Do you like it?

11
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:30,861
I don't understand why the hens lay so many eggs.

12
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,101
Did you see how much they clucked (sung) today?

13
00:03:33,821 --> 00:03:38,463
What is this? If the hens are not laying eggs 
then it is bad; if they lay too many, it is also bad.

14
00:03:38,582 --> 00:03:40,944
Don't tell me. I know from my mother.

15
00:03:41,505 --> 00:03:45,747
If the hens lay too many eggs or 
there is too much "sponge", it is bad.

16
00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:50,348
I don't like that Moisei has come.

17
00:03:50,748 --> 00:03:53,469
He asked me to call you.
Look, he is there.

18
00:03:56,108 --> 00:03:59,271
Help us Father.
She does not want to agree.

19
00:03:59,352 --> 00:04:03,153
We tried one way or the other to change her mind
but she wants her way.

20
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:04,953
She's does not even get upset anymore.

21
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:07,474
And she is saying terrifying words.

22
00:04:07,553 --> 00:04:10,595
mentality, lack of culture...

23
00:04:10,674 --> 00:04:14,316
About the faith of the ancestors.
- And in what way can I help?

24
00:04:15,002 --> 00:04:17,999
Is there anyone unacquainted with Father Alexander?

25
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:20,599
They all are familiar with your power of preaching.

26
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:22,360
It is said that it is a terrifying power.

27
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,201
I declare about Christ. For Christ.

28
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,641
While you, from what I understand
are asking something different,

29
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,643
to depart your daughter from Christ.

30
00:04:29,722 --> 00:04:33,605
By God, what are the costs?
You will depart one person,

31
00:04:33,685 --> 00:04:36,085
but you will gain another hundred of people.

32
00:04:36,164 --> 00:04:40,806
Think about it yourself, Father.
I have five daughters.

33
00:04:40,887 --> 00:04:43,687
And only one of them is married.

34
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:47,129
If Havocika will fulfill her stupid dreams,

35
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,610
Who will take her as a wife?

36
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:52,371
Our people won't take her, because she's one of you.

37
00:04:52,451 --> 00:04:55,372
And yours will not take her, because she is one of us.

38
00:04:55,452 --> 00:04:59,974
On your knees please.
Such an occasion.

39
00:05:02,455 --> 00:05:06,737
Havocika, daughter, come here,
Father wants to speak with you.

40
00:05:06,816 --> 00:05:09,218
I will go to her.

41
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,942
You must understand that this deed can be decisive,

42
00:05:21,022 --> 00:05:22,982
the most important of your life.

43
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:25,784
- I understand, Father.
- Until the end, are you so sure?

44
00:05:25,863 --> 00:05:28,986
Yes, Father. I've made up my mind.

45
00:05:29,185 --> 00:05:31,186
And nothing can stop me.

46
00:05:31,305 --> 00:05:34,307
Think about what it means for your parents and sisters

47
00:05:34,386 --> 00:05:39,229
to leave their faith and to receive the shining light of Orthodoxy.

48
00:05:39,308 --> 00:05:40,990
It is written in the Scriptures that

49
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:44,551
one should leave his parents and come to Christ.

50
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,671
That relatives are an obstacle for a person.

51
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,431
That is what's said,

52
00:05:49,311 --> 00:05:53,074
but Orthodoxy burdens a person with the weight of responsibility.

53
00:05:53,154 --> 00:05:55,795
Now you are only responsible for your people.

54
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:03,798
God will forgive you, 
if you remain with them.

55
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:07,840
God will forgive you, 
if you remain with them.

56
00:06:08,361 --> 00:06:11,961
You will be a good and loving mother,
a warmhearted wife

57
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,562
An honest neighbor,
and you will not do evil unto anyone in your lifetime.

58
00:06:15,682 --> 00:06:18,083
And if you will receive the mystery of baptism

59
00:06:18,282 --> 00:06:21,324
and then you will not be a good Christian,
this is something terrible and severe.

60
00:06:21,523 --> 00:06:24,086
There are some people who believe that 
if they are baptized they are readily saved.

61
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:25,927
It's not so by far.

62
00:06:26,446 --> 00:06:30,328
Think well about what I told you and
don't be in a hurry.

63
00:06:30,407 --> 00:06:32,168
You promise?

64
00:06:33,129 --> 00:06:34,889
Now I promise.

65
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:38,972
I will think about it. Maybe it's true.

66
00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:43,293
If you don't change your mind,
I will baptize you myself.

67
00:06:45,694 --> 00:06:47,734
Hava, this means Eva (Eve)?

68
00:06:48,054 --> 00:06:49,535
You will be called Eva.

69
00:06:49,654 --> 00:06:53,177
In the honor of the ancestor of the human folk.

70
00:06:54,977 --> 00:06:56,899
Very well, go to your father.

71
00:06:58,978 --> 00:07:00,940
I will think about it very much.

72
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,221
She's like a ladybug.
Come to me, my golden girl.

73
00:07:24,589 --> 00:07:27,310
Father Alexander, it's my fault.
The also the wife's.

74
00:07:27,789 --> 00:07:33,752
She drives me nuts,
Sometimes I feel like there's going to be murder.

75
00:07:33,952 --> 00:07:37,473
It is a sin to have such thoughts, surely,
but I will tell you a secret,

76
00:07:37,992 --> 00:07:41,474
sometimes even I, fear my Alevtina
and she is not close to my heart,

77
00:07:41,553 --> 00:07:43,475
but you can't run from yourself.

78
00:07:43,595 --> 00:07:45,116
Then I think -

79
00:07:45,235 --> 00:07:47,676
She is my sharpener, with her I get sharp.

80
00:07:47,757 --> 00:07:51,439
And if she wouldn't be at times so evil,
would I be as good as I am?

81
00:07:51,519 --> 00:07:52,880
- Good day!
- Good day!

82
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,361
Most of the time, God gives us wives that
are different from us.

83
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,082
As is the case with me and my
Alevtina Andreevna.

84
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:04,284
I am thin, tall and gentle
she is round and roly-poly.

85
00:08:04,683 --> 00:08:08,205
If you look at us from the side,
I look like one and she looks like zero.

86
00:08:08,324 --> 00:08:11,085
But together we form ten.

87
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:14,607
Without me, without one, she would have only been zero.

88
00:08:14,686 --> 00:08:20,090
But also I without her, without zero,
I would remain one only.

89
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:24,972
Kiril, the soldier. Come.
You came on leave? Come to the church.

90
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:31,014
Like that's what I needed...I will only 
go to the cemetery, to visit my father's grave.

91
00:08:31,094 --> 00:08:34,215
In vain. Today is the day of all saints,
it is your celebration (by name) also.

92
00:08:34,334 --> 00:08:38,616
Kiril the Alexandrite and Belozerskii, our neighbor.

93
00:08:39,456 --> 00:08:41,857
With you priests, every day
is a celebration.

94
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:47,180
Kiril...

95
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,982
Blessed is the kingdom of the Father and
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

96
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,143
Now and ever and unto the ages of ages. Amen.

97
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:03,467
With peace, let us pray to the Lord.

98
00:09:03,667 --> 00:09:08,868
Lord, have mercy.

99
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:14,830
For the peace up high and for the 
salvation of our souls, let us pray to the Lord.

100
00:09:20,153 --> 00:09:24,434
For our God protected country, 
for her leaders and her army, 

101
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:27,555
let us pray to the Lord.

102
00:09:31,415 --> 00:09:36,599
For the ones travelling by sea, on land, for the sick,
for the ones who are distressed and worried,

103
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:42,640
for the enslaved ones, for their salvation
let us pray to the Lord.

104
00:09:48,642 --> 00:09:54,645
In order for us to be delivered from all trouble, anger, danger
and need, let us pray to the Lord.

105
00:10:01,927 --> 00:10:05,688
Defend, save, have mercy and protect us, oh God,

106
00:10:05,767 --> 00:10:09,130
with your aptness.

107
00:10:12,652 --> 00:10:17,334
Citizens of the Soviet Union,

108
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:23,377
The soviet government and its leader,
tovarish (comrade) Stalin

109
00:10:23,937 --> 00:10:28,858
have commanded me to make the
following announcement.

110
00:10:28,977 --> 00:10:33,339
What a terrifying voice he is announcing with.
What could it be?

111
00:10:34,899 --> 00:10:37,660
Andriusa and Danilka will be drafted immediately.

112
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:41,543
What about Mitea and Vasea?
What do you think?

113
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,064
Will they send them to fight?

114
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:47,026
After all, they are priests.
Peresvet and Osleabea were monks.

115
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:49,466
But they fought at Kulikovo.

116
00:10:49,745 --> 00:10:51,827
What did you remember?!

117
00:11:11,034 --> 00:11:12,715
Father!

118
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:15,276
Father, bless!

119
00:11:15,356 --> 00:11:18,717
Or at least with holy water.

120
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:21,198
Immediately.

121
00:11:23,239 --> 00:11:24,839
Immediately.

122
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:38,365
- Morozov, we will send you to the military tribunal.
- At the tribunal...

123
00:11:46,127 --> 00:11:47,408
Father Alexander.

124
00:11:49,248 --> 00:11:52,049
Oh Lord, bless the army of these russian boys.

125
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:57,051
You alone know their names.
In the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

126
00:11:59,733 --> 00:12:03,454
unto the kingdom of Christ our God, together
with the Father and the Holy Spirit

127
00:12:03,533 --> 00:12:06,816
now and ever and unto the ages of ages.

128
00:12:44,469 --> 00:12:47,351
"Do you renounce satan and all his works,

129
00:12:47,471 --> 00:12:50,072
and all his servants,
and all his serving,

130
00:12:50,152 --> 00:12:51,952
and all his trickery?”

131
00:12:52,071 --> 00:12:53,712
I renounce.

132
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:15,161
Do you unite yourself with Christ?

133
00:13:15,761 --> 00:13:17,041
Do you unite yourself with Christ?

134
00:13:17,162 --> 00:13:19,243
I unite myself to Christ.

135
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:37,009
It's a Russian tradition.
Bread and salt.

136
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:40,970
Loligager.

137
00:13:41,049 --> 00:13:43,852
The servant of God Eva is
being baptized.

138
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:03,179
There's our trophy.

139
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:06,981
This is their leader - Lenin.

140
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:11,102
No, this is his prize.

141
00:14:11,701 --> 00:14:14,503
This is a bolshevik stallion.

142
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:19,065
Oh, such an odor comes from this animal.

143
00:14:21,667 --> 00:14:23,587
Take pictures faster.

144
00:14:32,109 --> 00:14:34,431
So? did you baptize that girl?

145
00:14:34,551 --> 00:14:37,593
- I cannot not baptize her.
- I won't say anything.

146
00:14:37,992 --> 00:14:39,513
My white-haired rabbit.

147
00:14:39,633 --> 00:14:45,595
You have a reason to be joyful.
A letter from your best friend.

148
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:51,276
From Vladica Serghie.

149
00:15:08,082 --> 00:15:10,445
He is asking me to come to him in Riga.

150
00:15:24,888 --> 00:15:28,692
It means that you, a German, have fought
for the Tsar and Russia against the Germans?

151
00:15:28,771 --> 00:15:32,213
You see, I am a German Russian.

152
00:15:32,612 --> 00:15:35,734
In 1914 I finished Aleksandr military highschool.

153
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:38,495
I left on the austrian front.
- And in 1917?

154
00:15:38,614 --> 00:15:40,776
In the autumn of '17 I was in Moscow.

155
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:43,337
Have you fought with the junkers for Kremlin?

156
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:45,978
For Kerenski, give me a break.

157
00:15:57,782 --> 00:16:00,143
Thank you.

158
00:16:00,783 --> 00:16:01,824
One icecream.

159
00:16:01,903 --> 00:16:06,186
Then the Don River, then Denikin, the defeat, the end.

160
00:16:06,505 --> 00:16:10,467
In the '20s I returned to the home of my ancestors,
in occidental Prussia (Germany),

161
00:16:10,547 --> 00:16:13,989
I have become a colonel,
but I remain orthodox.

162
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:20,030
Very well. So you are saying,
you know Hitler personally?

163
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,471
A few days ago I had lunch with him
and some of his close ones.

164
00:16:23,591 --> 00:16:26,233
And, what about it, does he wish
the rebirth of Orthodoxy in Russia?

165
00:16:26,313 --> 00:16:29,195
You wish for a direct answer? Then - no. 

166
00:16:29,274 --> 00:16:31,795
In this case,
it's a momentary weekness?

167
00:16:32,195 --> 00:16:35,036
And then, like in the time of the Romans,
the persecution,

168
00:16:35,155 --> 00:16:37,317
crucified Christians along the roads?

169
00:16:38,077 --> 00:16:41,399
Or as it is usually with our civilized world...

170
00:16:43,038 --> 00:16:46,961
Generally, the Fuhrer cares little about this.

171
00:16:47,081 --> 00:16:49,842
But the people that take care of our problem

172
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:54,884
are interested in the rebirth 
of the church life in Russia.

173
00:16:55,403 --> 00:16:57,405
Or you have other solutions?

174
00:16:59,524 --> 00:17:01,087
Unfortunately, no.

175
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:05,128
Bless, vlãdica.

176
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,780
Yes, within the land of Pskov

177
00:17:38,980 --> 00:17:42,461
there is not one temple functioning,
they all have been tainted.

178
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:45,062
Wearing away, empty.

179
00:17:45,621 --> 00:17:50,345
And it is meet to transform this desert
in a godly manner.

180
00:17:51,906 --> 00:17:55,947
You, Father Gheorghii,
and you, father Kiril...

181
00:17:56,268 --> 00:17:58,228
We will have to do our best.

182
00:17:58,307 --> 00:18:01,349
Where we would gather so many priests?

183
00:18:02,509 --> 00:18:04,151
We will search everywhere.'

184
00:18:04,271 --> 00:18:05,911
All over Pribaltika.

185
00:18:08,831 --> 00:18:10,512
Vladica, forgive me.

186
00:18:10,591 --> 00:18:14,073
Father Alexander from Tihonie
is looking for you.

187
00:18:14,273 --> 00:18:15,793
Call him.

188
00:18:15,873 --> 00:18:19,555
There is our first priest for our mission.

189
00:18:19,634 --> 00:18:23,717
It's the best example for a Russian priest.

190
00:18:23,837 --> 00:18:27,439
He holds short sermons, but
they touch you straight to the heart.

191
00:18:27,519 --> 00:18:29,120
I know him for a long time.

192
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,841
He had his share of trouble during the 20s.

193
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:35,441
Deportations, concentration camps.
Everything, generally.

194
00:18:36,443 --> 00:18:37,883
May I?

195
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,644
Bless, vladica.

196
00:18:47,806 --> 00:18:51,127
Have a seat father Alexander.
Have some tea.

197
00:18:51,326 --> 00:18:54,329
Good day, fathers. Happy holidays.

198
00:18:55,609 --> 00:18:59,250
As in war times, I am presenting myself
at your command.

199
00:18:59,569 --> 00:19:03,172
We were just talking about you.
- About me?

200
00:19:03,652 --> 00:19:04,933
You have nothing else to talk about?

201
00:19:05,013 --> 00:19:07,133
We were guessing: whoever will enter first,

202
00:19:07,213 --> 00:19:11,415
that one will be the first priest for
the Orthodox mission in Pskov.

203
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:14,456


204
00:19:15,856 --> 00:19:17,498
What's with this mission?

205
00:19:17,577 --> 00:19:20,259
The rebirth of Orthodoxy in Pskov.

206
00:19:20,378 --> 00:19:23,059
With the help of the Germans?

207
00:19:24,221 --> 00:19:26,221
It is not good.

208
00:19:27,261 --> 00:19:29,542
Let us renovate the churches; surely, we must.

209
00:19:29,661 --> 00:19:31,583
And people are kind of lonely without churches.

210
00:19:31,662 --> 00:19:33,223
But with the Germans' help?

211
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:37,625
Even if sometimes I should know
my place and I should be quiet,

212
00:19:37,985 --> 00:19:40,147
I will still ask you, however.

213
00:19:40,346 --> 00:19:42,667
What is this, Fathers, dears...

214
00:19:43,347 --> 00:19:46,869
Doesn't it mean betraying our country?

215
00:19:47,550 --> 00:19:49,870
The Soviets have no God - they 
are not our country.

216
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:51,871
This is so, but think for yourselves.

217
00:19:51,991 --> 00:19:54,791
I was baptized in the honor of Aleksandr Nevski,

218
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,753
I honor him as a protector.
And he defeated the Germans.

219
00:19:57,953 --> 00:20:00,234
We are Russians.

220
00:20:03,113 --> 00:20:08,356
The good shepherd will even offer his own
soul, for the good of the sheep.

221
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:17,201
Our people will suffer a lot under the Germans.

222
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:23,443
Could we - then - deprive the people
of God's caressing?

223
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:27,404
If it is so...

224
00:20:29,005 --> 00:20:30,605
I am ready.

225
00:20:30,684 --> 00:20:33,766
And where will you "dislocate" me?

226
00:20:33,966 --> 00:20:37,047
You say you were named in the 
honor of Aleksandr Nevski?

227
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:44,291
Then leave for the village Zakati.

228
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,373
The church from that village
carries the dedication of your protector.

229
00:20:47,452 --> 00:20:49,173
As you wish to
bless me, Vladica.

230
00:20:55,015 --> 00:20:57,335
Russia is so strange.

231
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:03,418
What a monstrous combination between
life's sorrow and nature's beauty.

232
00:21:05,338 --> 00:21:09,819
Look, this sky, this river,
this beautiful forest, the birds' song.

233
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:16,063
And then this decrepit construction,
- L'Arc de Triumphe.

234
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,864
Yes, Paris, Paris.

235
00:21:20,064 --> 00:21:23,266
Aim higher. Rome, Babylon.

236
00:21:24,145 --> 00:21:26,586
Yeah, right. Let's leave.

237
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:33,029
Be careful.

238
00:21:36,550 --> 00:21:39,191
What beautiful weather.

239
00:21:39,792 --> 00:21:42,112
Hard to believe that there is a war on.

240
00:21:42,431 --> 00:21:44,553
People are killing each other.

241
00:21:45,392 --> 00:21:50,515
You don't believe? Your Lioska is killing. 
If he's not being killed.

242
00:21:50,596 --> 00:21:54,517
O, you parasite.
How is your tongue not drying out?

243
00:22:21,847 --> 00:22:23,408
Children.

244
00:22:25,288 --> 00:22:27,209
Picture...

245
00:22:27,688 --> 00:22:29,769
Don't be scared, children.

246
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:35,573
Come on, the bird
will fly from here. 

247
00:22:37,693 --> 00:22:40,335
Hans, you can verify your theory.

248
00:22:40,454 --> 00:22:44,376
Why not. It's a chance.
You are not asleep.

249
00:22:47,257 --> 00:22:49,417
One more time.

250
00:22:52,819 --> 00:22:54,540
Cursed woman.

251
00:22:54,739 --> 00:22:58,821
Hans, stop it. What is it, you haven't
been slapped by girls before?

252
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,421
Hans, hide the gun.

253
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:05,823
Hans, calm down.
Ready, it's time to leave.

254
00:23:05,902 --> 00:23:07,906
It's only a child.

255
00:23:14,147 --> 00:23:15,908
Are you out of your mind?!

256
00:23:16,548 --> 00:23:19,709
You missed, Big Shooter.
The brandy is mine.

257
00:23:19,829 --> 00:23:21,669
I hope you are convinced.

258
00:23:21,748 --> 00:23:24,031
Your theory is dumb.

259
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:26,512
Russian girls do wear underwear.

260
00:23:26,632 --> 00:23:29,872
Masha...

261
00:23:31,313 --> 00:23:33,593
He killed her!

262
00:23:40,956 --> 00:23:43,719
Well, where is this war of yours?

263
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,760
It looks like they killed a cow.

264
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:51,681
Such good drivers you are.

265
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,803
What am I going to feed
my children with?

266
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:58,324
What are you looking for here, shameless people?
You should have remained in your Germany.

267
00:23:58,404 --> 00:24:02,765
May you die!
Dear sun...

268
00:24:07,327 --> 00:24:09,567
What am I going to feed my children with...

269
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:13,850
Where are you, Lord?!

270
00:24:13,929 --> 00:24:17,250
Let's go.
- My dear child.

271
00:24:52,863 --> 00:24:54,025
Let me have a smoke.

272
00:24:54,105 --> 00:24:56,425
Cigarette?
- Aha.

273
00:24:57,826 --> 00:24:59,467
So I can smoke, yes.

274
00:25:05,949 --> 00:25:07,990
A good German cigarette.

275
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:13,792
Are you going to pour for him, also?

276
00:25:13,872 --> 00:25:15,713
Can't make a joke anymore.

277
00:25:16,673 --> 00:25:18,354
Don't make me laugh.

278
00:25:19,713 --> 00:25:21,715
My camera is shaking.

279
00:25:23,514 --> 00:25:25,876
Comrades.

280
00:25:26,076 --> 00:25:27,716
Comrades.

281
00:25:50,366 --> 00:25:52,446
Look, Walter, what is she doing?

282
00:25:52,565 --> 00:25:54,487
She's milking the dead cow.

283
00:25:59,488 --> 00:26:02,531
Milk. Fresh.

284
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,501
We are going to unknown places.

285
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:35,263
Why unknown? Russia, Pskov,
old city of the Russian country.

286
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,264
I know you from somewhere, Father Alexander.

287
00:26:38,384 --> 00:26:40,946
We met in Riga.
- With icecream.

288
00:26:41,025 --> 00:26:43,866
Exactly.

289
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:44,168
Look what happened here.

290
00:27:45,889 --> 00:27:47,609
Where?

291
00:27:50,651 --> 00:27:53,694
Where the Battle on the Frozen Lake
took place, a few miles from here.

292
00:27:57,135 --> 00:27:59,495
As if you wouldn't know.

293
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:03,816
Such a strange person you are, Lioska.

294
00:28:03,896 --> 00:28:09,819
Do you know that here, where the club is,
used to be a church dedicated to Aleksandr Nevski?

295
00:28:11,618 --> 00:28:13,260
Yes.

296
00:28:27,386 --> 00:28:28,507
Masenka...

297
00:28:28,586 --> 00:28:32,748
All my distress...

298
00:28:32,908 --> 00:28:35,308
untie her...

299
00:28:36,268 --> 00:28:41,591
as you wish...

300
00:28:41,671 --> 00:28:44,632
Boy. Don't be afraid, I'm one of ours.

301
00:28:45,992 --> 00:28:50,594
Do you have something to eat?

302
00:28:50,674 --> 00:28:53,475
I do. Some bread and fish.

303
00:28:54,114 --> 00:28:57,477
Only that I am not a boy. I am Eva.

304
00:28:59,276 --> 00:29:02,359
We are going in order to make the desert reborn.
That is why we are missionaries.

305
00:29:02,479 --> 00:29:04,800
The orthodox mission in Pskov.

306
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:07,000
It is not without meaning that
tomorrow is the celebration of Appearance Changing.

307
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:08,761
Aha, we're going.

308
00:29:09,961 --> 00:29:13,883
Nice words - to be reborn with the Germans.

309
00:29:15,122 --> 00:29:17,724
They will stick them on
your foreheads, afterwards.

310
00:29:18,164 --> 00:29:20,686
Judas. You will never be clean again.

311
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:24,487
Andreevna.
- OK, I'll be quiet.

312
00:29:24,927 --> 00:29:27,928
Don't be upset, mother Alevtina.

313
00:29:28,248 --> 00:29:30,969
It's not the case to give
consideration to the label.

314
00:29:32,609 --> 00:29:34,650
So we start working.

315
00:29:37,532 --> 00:29:41,853
Chief, we could use some cold water.

316
00:29:43,853 --> 00:29:48,537
If it weren't for this war, in 2-3 years
all churches of Russia,

317
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:52,618
all down to the last one, would have been destroyed
by the communists.

318
00:29:54,498 --> 00:29:56,619
And you together with them.

319
00:30:32,911 --> 00:30:34,113
Halt!

320
00:30:39,634 --> 00:30:42,195
Good evening!
Hell, Johann!

321
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:44,597
Hey, Paul!
- Is that you?

322
00:30:45,037 --> 00:30:48,039
I see you're wearing a 
belly now?

323
00:30:48,118 --> 00:30:49,720
They are jolly.

324
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,681
Maybe they are laughing on our
account, too.

325
00:30:53,801 --> 00:30:58,242
Look at their faces...
Even the pig is more modest.

326
00:30:58,321 --> 00:31:01,803
Father Gheorghi, put a lock to your mouth.
Why should we search for trouble?

327
00:31:02,602 --> 00:31:04,644
It will be necessary...

328
00:31:05,285 --> 00:31:09,686
To trick the Germans? It will be hard.

329
00:31:09,966 --> 00:31:14,728
We crushed the Bolsheviks, and now we aren't 
going to be able to fool the sausage-makers (Germans)?

330
00:31:14,808 --> 00:31:19,210
Well you see, as you are saying,
I am the offspring of sausage-makers.

331
00:31:20,250 --> 00:31:23,253
That is why I know it will be hard.

332
00:31:24,172 --> 00:31:27,694
But, do you have a fiancee?
- Sure I do.

333
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:29,974
Masha.

334
00:31:31,694 --> 00:31:33,855
I don't have a fiance.

335
00:31:34,134 --> 00:31:35,976
But I am not even beautiful.

336
00:31:36,576 --> 00:31:39,418
What do you know, a little munchkin
and already requires a fiance.

337
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:47,301
Oh come on don't be upset.

338
00:31:48,981 --> 00:31:51,822
Do you remember the story about
the ugly duckling?

339
00:31:53,182 --> 00:31:55,024
Well, you see.

340
00:31:55,224 --> 00:31:59,226
Who are you visiting in Zakat?
- The Father

341
00:31:59,385 --> 00:32:02,306
The priest, you say? Wonderful.

342
00:32:02,385 --> 00:32:07,108
Although, if I think about it, it was a miracle
that I got out of being surrounded.

343
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:38,800
The German, the German is a sausage,
on top of baked sauerkraut.

344
00:32:38,879 --> 00:32:41,642
Son, be quiet, for the love of God.

345
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:08,371
Well, ready.

346
00:33:08,852 --> 00:33:10,373
Here we are.

347
00:33:11,212 --> 00:33:16,735
Now search for your priest,
I am in a hurry. Bye.

348
00:33:18,255 --> 00:33:20,016
What is your name?

349
00:33:22,016 --> 00:33:25,337
Lioska. Lugotintzev.

350
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:34,100
Be quiet, Hoary, it's me.

351
00:33:37,022 --> 00:33:38,623
Masha...

352
00:33:43,183 --> 00:33:45,026
Lioska.

353
00:33:51,308 --> 00:33:54,709
Welcome in good health, soldier.
- Good health.

354
00:33:55,228 --> 00:33:57,269
Good health. Hello, Kostean.

355
00:33:57,349 --> 00:33:59,710
They killed Masha.

356
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:03,192
Go to bed.

357
00:34:05,313 --> 00:34:10,035
True. The Germans shot her.

358
00:34:38,006 --> 00:34:40,126
Hold this.

359
00:34:41,006 --> 00:34:45,848
I wanted to do it myself, but the family...

360
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:51,890
Indeed, I only have four bullets.

361
00:34:56,771 --> 00:34:58,453
What's this stupid thing?

362
00:34:58,533 --> 00:35:02,495
Russian fashionable entertainment.
I know how it is used.

363
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:04,216
Looks like a hanging tree.

364
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:07,737
There are three ropes, we need three.

365
00:35:12,697 --> 00:35:17,459
Lioska.
- You haven't told me, yes or no?

366
00:35:17,539 --> 00:35:20,941
Well, Lioska, how can I say so fast?

367
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:24,422
Why do you love me?

368
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:29,303
Well, I don't know.
You're not like the others.

369
00:35:29,504 --> 00:35:32,026
How?
- I don't know.

370
00:35:33,146 --> 00:35:34,827
Well, yes or no?

371
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:38,909
Come on, Lugotintzev.

372
00:35:39,029 --> 00:35:42,510
If I say "No"?

373
00:35:45,431 --> 00:35:47,551
Then I will ask you why.

374
00:35:47,631 --> 00:35:53,033
For example, because I got engaged
with somebody else.

375
00:35:54,114 --> 00:35:56,114
With that policeman?

376
00:35:59,555 --> 00:36:03,237
You are lying.
You have no fiance.

377
00:36:03,316 --> 00:36:04,877
I know everything.

378
00:36:04,957 --> 00:36:08,440
Everything, but not all.
What can I say, Know-it-all.

379
00:36:18,922 --> 00:36:21,324
In the end, you will be mine anyway.

380
00:36:22,444 --> 00:36:26,166
Because nobody will love you like I do.

381
00:36:29,047 --> 00:36:33,569
Faster, faster, come on, faster!

382
00:36:34,969 --> 00:36:38,450
More, are you asleep? Come on!

383
00:36:40,651 --> 00:36:42,533
Lioska.

384
00:36:42,892 --> 00:36:44,293
What's with you...

385
00:36:44,412 --> 00:36:46,134
Come on! I want more!

386
00:36:46,733 --> 00:36:50,095
What kind of carousel is this, there's no music!

387
00:36:50,334 --> 00:36:52,455
Music! Come on!

388
00:36:54,375 --> 00:36:57,019
Come on, faster! Comeon!

389
00:37:22,266 --> 00:37:24,147
Lioska.

390
00:39:06,306 --> 00:39:08,988
Attention.

391
00:39:56,485 --> 00:39:58,286
Father Aleksander...

392
00:39:58,405 --> 00:40:04,128
Oh Lord.
Nikolai Toroptzev found a bell.

393
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,972
One second! Don't blink.

394
00:40:14,652 --> 00:40:16,093
One second!

395
00:40:17,614 --> 00:40:21,335
Perfect!
- Isn't it?

396
00:40:22,055 --> 00:40:23,937
OK, ready.

397
00:40:24,336 --> 00:40:27,377
Thank God they haven't thrown it too far.

398
00:40:27,456 --> 00:40:29,618
It only needs some cleaning.
- Father.

399
00:40:29,738 --> 00:40:32,379
The bell will have a voice again.
- Ladybug.

400
00:40:32,458 --> 00:40:34,539
Ladybug! Where are you coming from, heavenly being?

401
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:37,420
There, I came.

402
00:40:40,142 --> 00:40:43,542
What year did they take it down?
- I think it was in the 30s...

403
00:40:55,027 --> 00:40:57,509
Wait here.

404
00:41:16,676 --> 00:41:18,596
Alia.

405
00:41:20,476 --> 00:41:23,558
I'm thinking what to do with the map.
- Leave it alone now.

406
00:41:23,958 --> 00:41:29,761
Alia, I...
My Jew-girl ran away to us.

407
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,201
What Jew-girl?

408
00:41:31,321 --> 00:41:35,002
Daughter of Moisei, the one I baptized
at Tihii, remember?

409
00:41:36,683 --> 00:41:39,003
How can I not remember. I remember.

410
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:43,165
All her relatives were killed by the
fascists, she is the only one remaining.

411
00:41:43,246 --> 00:41:45,767
She was not baptized in vain.

412
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:56,410
You want to say, in fact, that, thank God, our house is big enough?

413
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:02,253
Yes.

414
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,657
Well, wellcome, Eva.

415
00:42:14,937 --> 00:42:17,699
The daughter of Jerusalem...

416
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:27,702
The Germans are coming.

417
00:42:27,742 --> 00:42:29,062
They are bringing a movie.

418
00:42:29,142 --> 00:42:32,264
They are happy to see us?
- It looks so.

419
00:42:35,425 --> 00:42:39,827
Hurray. Film.

420
00:43:01,353 --> 00:43:04,716
The more we advance,
Europe understands better

421
00:43:04,796 --> 00:43:09,477
the danger that 
bolshevism (Russian communism) represents.

422
00:43:10,119 --> 00:43:13,600
On June 22nd, 1941,

423
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:17,561
Germany was constrained to start
the fight against bolshevism...

424
00:43:22,482 --> 00:43:24,964
Fights for extermination in the East.

425
00:43:28,964 --> 00:43:32,606
After intense fighting,
the enemy was pushed back.

426
00:43:42,490 --> 00:43:45,852
This day was transformed into a
great popular celebration.

427
00:43:50,934 --> 00:43:53,495
The irresponsible bolshevik commandment

428
00:43:53,615 --> 00:43:57,256
again and again, is sending
masses of people to certain death.

429
00:43:58,697 --> 00:44:01,497
Why are you showing us these?

430
00:44:02,257 --> 00:44:04,698
You want to trample on us definitively?

431
00:44:05,457 --> 00:44:11,342
What are you talking about, Father Alexander.
This is part of my job.

432
00:44:11,421 --> 00:44:15,703
Certainly, I am very worried with regards
to the fate of the prisoners.

433
00:44:15,783 --> 00:44:20,064
It's madness.
Who will take care of them?

434
00:44:20,144 --> 00:44:24,587
And there are more than two million.

435
00:44:24,667 --> 00:44:27,668
Not far from here,
in Siraia Nizina (Humid Valley),

436
00:44:27,748 --> 00:44:31,149
there is a concentration camp.

437
00:44:31,269 --> 00:44:35,470
I am sincerely compassionate towards the prisoners.
They are suffering above any limit.

438
00:44:36,030 --> 00:44:37,751
Almost without food.

439
00:44:37,951 --> 00:44:39,993
Stalin has not signed the Convention,

440
00:44:40,112 --> 00:44:44,434
and the international Red Cross
cannot intervene.

441
00:45:13,444 --> 00:45:16,086
I love you, Helga. I love you so much.
You believe her? Without a doubt, Rudi.

442
00:45:16,206 --> 00:45:19,727
If it's written "Forever yours",
it means that it is so.

443
00:45:32,652 --> 00:45:35,054
Rudi, wait! Stop, Rudi!

444
00:45:38,134 --> 00:45:39,535
Rudi, no!

445
00:45:39,614 --> 00:45:42,057
Don't shoot!

446
00:46:00,941 --> 00:46:06,305
Don't shoot, no...
Please, no.

447
00:46:49,601 --> 00:46:52,522
Forever yours. Helga.

448
00:46:56,763 --> 00:46:58,604
We are getting ready...

449
00:47:00,444 --> 00:47:02,807
Vasiok, closer.
- Like so?

450
00:47:02,887 --> 00:47:04,967
Pristavkin, where is my face?
And put the hands down.

451
00:47:05,046 --> 00:47:06,608
Look at them taking a picture.

452
00:47:06,688 --> 00:47:09,649
Bravo.

453
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:15,850
Whatch out so you won't fall off the bike.

454
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:20,013
Are we going to "engrave" ourself for 
eternity or not, already?!

455
00:47:21,453 --> 00:47:23,494
Why are you staring?

456
00:47:26,415 --> 00:47:29,097
Atention, picture.

457
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:39,660
Open!

458
00:47:43,701 --> 00:47:44,982
Wait.

459
00:47:45,501 --> 00:47:49,023
He's a priest.
We have order to leave them alone.

460
00:47:56,105 --> 00:47:59,348
What's this?
- I'm dying.

461
00:48:03,309 --> 00:48:07,831
Stefan. It's you?
- Hi.

462
00:48:09,031 --> 00:48:13,273
You're here too.
- It would seem so.

463
00:48:13,393 --> 00:48:16,874
What are they feeding you here?
- Almost nothing.

464
00:48:19,234 --> 00:48:20,554
To the side.

465
00:48:22,980 --> 00:48:26,782
Give me the bucket.
Don't you understand? Work with song!

466
00:48:26,862 --> 00:48:31,224
This is Kolika the crazy.
I take care of him.

467
00:48:35,705 --> 00:48:39,467
Are you hungry?
Do you want to eat or not?

468
00:48:39,987 --> 00:48:41,948
Then sing us something.

469
00:48:43,548 --> 00:48:47,269
Work with a song.
- Come on, sing.

470
00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:51,830
Russians like to sing when they're working.
- Yes, that is so.

471
00:48:59,794 --> 00:49:02,315
Eat till you split open.

472
00:49:07,077 --> 00:49:10,479
You had better leave, Father.

473
00:49:14,760 --> 00:49:19,721
Split. Split.

474
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:40,891
Come on, leave. Do you want in there?

475
00:49:55,775 --> 00:50:01,578
Food, drugs,
clothes...

476
00:50:06,299 --> 00:50:07,979
Lord, have mercy on us, sinners.

477
00:50:08,059 --> 00:50:14,062
Brothers, please leave one little piece for me.

478
00:50:36,791 --> 00:50:39,151
There's the first round of snow in Pokrov.

479
00:50:39,631 --> 00:50:41,392
Glory to Thee, oh Lord.
- Happy Holidays.

480
00:50:41,472 --> 00:50:43,392
What a beauty.

481
00:50:43,472 --> 00:50:46,354
Happy Holidays.

482
00:50:46,554 --> 00:50:48,476
Grandma, why Pokrov?
(Covering)

483
00:50:48,556 --> 00:50:51,998
"Covering" because the Mother of God

484
00:50:52,118 --> 00:50:54,678
takes out her headcover and covers and
defends us all from enemies.

485
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:02,841
What do you know...

486
00:51:11,643 --> 00:51:15,524
Well, Father Alexander,
are you treating me?

487
00:51:15,885 --> 00:51:19,487
- I won it.
- Definitely.

488
00:51:19,607 --> 00:51:21,208
What shall we do, Ivan Fiodorovici,
to bring to the prisoners

489
00:51:21,288 --> 00:51:25,089
from the concentration camp
warm clothes and provisions?

490
00:51:25,170 --> 00:51:26,610
Would it be possible?

491
00:51:28,571 --> 00:51:30,051
It would...

492
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:37,174
But, Father Alexander, do you know how
to decode the USSR abbreviation?

493
00:51:38,574 --> 00:51:41,415

Undo Stalin to Save Russia.

494
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:52,940
This... Father has cut
drawings for the children.

495
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:55,140
Learning material.

496
00:51:55,260 --> 00:51:59,822
The children have grown,
but the little Father is not mature yet.

497
00:51:59,902 --> 00:52:01,903
Cut.

498
00:52:18,109 --> 00:52:20,471
What's this? Ivan Fiodorovici

499
00:52:22,271 --> 00:52:24,232
The people are delighted, Father.

500
00:52:24,632 --> 00:52:27,913
The defense of the Reds has fallen next to Moscow.
With no resistance.

501
00:52:27,993 --> 00:52:32,234
The people from the capital are
enthusiastically welcoming the liberators.

502
00:52:48,921 --> 00:52:51,602
What's going to happen, Sasenka?

503
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:54,483
Nothing, we will see...

504
00:52:54,843 --> 00:52:58,724
Moscow... What's going on with Moscow...

505
00:52:58,924 --> 00:53:02,405
As far as I remember, after the fire
it was rebuilt even more beautifully.

506
00:53:10,048 --> 00:53:13,451
I have two bottles of samogonka.
Russian Schnapps.

507
00:53:13,891 --> 00:53:17,492
What is it called, zamogonka?
-No-no, samogonka.

508
00:53:17,892 --> 00:53:20,853
The best cure for the Russian winter.

509
00:53:30,696 --> 00:53:34,137
Surrender!
- Erkentih.

510
00:53:34,217 --> 00:53:39,660
Come here.
- Her com.

511
00:53:40,060 --> 00:53:42,141
Stay still.

512
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:46,904
We will go crazy if we stay
without doing anything.

513
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,308
Attention.

514
00:54:02,508 --> 00:54:04,749
I see, I hear.

515
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:09,431
Repeat, I didn't understand.

516
00:54:13,313 --> 00:54:15,714
It's like a cadril (dance).
- Quiet, boys.

517
00:54:15,794 --> 00:54:17,914
- Quiet.

518
00:54:17,994 --> 00:54:20,995
Great cadrils we were having at the 
club before the war...

519
00:54:21,075 --> 00:54:23,917
Am I right, Lioska?
- Leave him alone.

520
00:54:50,807 --> 00:54:53,167
Lioska.

521
00:54:53,367 --> 00:54:55,048
Look, the priest.

522
00:54:55,128 --> 00:54:56,888
He is going to church.

523
00:54:57,489 --> 00:55:00,011
What a nice place it was before.
Films, music, dances.

524
00:55:00,091 --> 00:55:02,332
OK, don't stray.

525
00:55:03,812 --> 00:55:07,574
Aleksei, where are you going?
- I'm going to the club, to dance.

526
00:55:07,694 --> 00:55:11,295
That's where the Germans are.
They are celebrating their Christmas.

527
00:55:11,375 --> 00:55:14,656
Leave me alone. Do you understand?

528
00:55:53,430 --> 00:55:57,231
So this is how you have it here.

529
00:56:00,112 --> 00:56:03,435
What are you waiting for? Turn off the light.

530
00:56:03,875 --> 00:56:05,595
Turn off the light.

531
00:56:10,678 --> 00:56:12,358
You wouldn't want to kill me, would you?

532
00:56:12,438 --> 00:56:15,159
I don't know, yet.

533
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:21,521
My legs.
I ran all day.

534
00:56:21,721 --> 00:56:23,722
What have I done wrong to you?

535
00:56:24,242 --> 00:56:27,483
You have rotten the very core of my life.

536
00:56:28,043 --> 00:56:32,485
- When did I manage?
- Listen to me, priest, and don't interrupt.

537
00:56:32,565 --> 00:56:35,727
Who are you,
where did you come from?

538
00:56:36,047 --> 00:56:38,208
Who invited you here, loud-mouth?

539
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,768
Who are you serving?

540
00:56:41,568 --> 00:56:43,770
The Germans, the traitors.

541
00:56:47,051 --> 00:56:52,213
I was born and raised here in Zakati.

542
00:56:52,693 --> 00:56:54,574
I loved here.

543
00:56:56,174 --> 00:57:02,097
My first and my last love.

544
00:57:03,257 --> 00:57:04,377
Masha Toroptzeva.

545
00:57:04,457 --> 00:57:10,420
And look, right here I confessed
my love to her.

546
00:57:12,420 --> 00:57:14,781
The Germans came and killed her.

547
00:57:17,021 --> 00:57:18,022
Now you.

548
00:57:18,102 --> 00:57:20,903
Wait...
- Hold on!

549
00:57:30,828 --> 00:57:33,509
Aren't you afraid of death?

550
00:57:36,749 --> 00:57:38,710
I'm afraid.

551
00:57:40,751 --> 00:57:44,312
But, if my time has come,
then glory to the Lord.

552
00:57:44,512 --> 00:57:49,113
Before finishing what you have in mind,
let me untie you from your sins.

553
00:57:51,074 --> 00:57:54,717
What is you name?
- Lioha.

554
00:57:55,077 --> 00:57:56,677
Are you baptized?

555
00:57:56,757 --> 00:57:59,119
My stupid grandmother baptized me in childhood.

556
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:16,644
Jesus Christ the Exceedingly-merciful and Lover of people

557
00:58:16,724 --> 00:58:19,805
may He forgive you, the servant of God Alexei,
everything that you have done wrong,

558
00:58:19,885 --> 00:58:23,046
and the sin which you have in your mind to murder a priest.

559
00:58:23,126 --> 00:58:25,687
And the unworthy priest which is I,
with the power given to me,

560
00:58:25,767 --> 00:58:28,449
I forgive and untie you of all your sins.

561
00:58:28,569 --> 00:58:30,091
In the name of the Father

562
00:58:30,931 --> 00:58:36,892
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

563
00:58:49,737 --> 00:58:52,217
You know you're something, priest.

564
00:58:59,421 --> 00:59:01,302
Lord and Mother of God.

565
00:59:01,942 --> 00:59:04,944
Thank you for being merciful with
me, the sinner.

566
00:59:05,984 --> 00:59:09,785
And this dumb boy you have delivered from 
eternal death.

567
00:59:18,348 --> 00:59:21,509
Mother, tell me honestly...

568
00:59:22,229 --> 00:59:25,911
Do I look Jewish?
- No, Lord be with you.

569
00:59:26,871 --> 00:59:29,512
Russian 100%

570
00:59:39,115 --> 00:59:41,557
Slower, your trigger will brake.

571
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,439
Our priest is again coming from somewhere.

572
00:59:48,520 --> 00:59:50,880
HE travels the roads, goes through villages,
departs people from this world and baptizes.

573
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,162
Isn't he going to the partisans?

574
00:59:58,403 --> 01:00:01,124
What's going on, Granpa,
are you entering into Jerusalem?

575
01:00:06,566 --> 01:00:08,927
Seed of antichrist...

576
01:00:18,811 --> 01:00:20,572
Eva.

577
01:00:20,652 --> 01:00:22,533
Father is back.
- Play.

578
01:00:22,613 --> 01:00:23,733
Excuse me?

579
01:00:23,813 --> 01:00:27,014
Starting with today you are my legal
daughter, with documents.

580
01:00:27,374 --> 01:00:29,535
Eva Aleksandrovna Ionina.

581
01:00:30,615 --> 01:00:33,896
Pray for the health of the servant of God
Ivan Fiodorici Freihausen.

582
01:00:34,016 --> 01:00:36,097
He has helped us.

583
01:00:39,378 --> 01:00:42,859
Restless child. Like a ladybug.
Wait.

584
01:00:42,979 --> 01:00:44,900
Let us serve lunch.
I don't want to.

585
01:00:45,300 --> 01:00:46,660
Still.

586
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:49,381
He managed to bring the prisoners
from the concentration camp

587
01:00:50,383 --> 01:00:52,505
into our church.

588
01:00:52,625 --> 01:00:54,705
Glory to the Lord.
- Truly.

589
01:01:02,667 --> 01:01:06,749
I'm looking at you, Father,
and I wonder.

590
01:01:07,629 --> 01:01:09,350
Are you for the Germans?

591
01:01:09,830 --> 01:01:12,791
Although it would seem that you are not.

592
01:01:13,351 --> 01:01:15,151
You had better decide,
who are you for.

593
01:01:15,271 --> 01:01:19,193
I am for Jesus Christ, for the Mother of God,
for Seraphim of Sarov.

594
01:01:19,273 --> 01:01:21,074
I understand, the list is long.

595
01:01:21,354 --> 01:01:25,436
We are under the Metropolitan of Pribaltica and Pskov,

596
01:01:25,516 --> 01:01:28,398
Serghie Voskresenski,

597
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:32,479
The Metropolitan of Moscow,
the vicar of the patriarchal throne.

598
01:01:32,599 --> 01:01:35,719
Of Moscow?
And who does Moscow belong to?

599
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,481
It means that you are serving the Germans,
but with the corner of your eye you look towards Moscow.

600
01:01:39,962 --> 01:01:43,442
It will not work for you, pops.

601
01:01:44,323 --> 01:01:47,363
Russians will return, they will hang
us both on the same branch.

602
01:01:49,125 --> 01:01:51,045
What do you say about this?

603
01:01:51,886 --> 01:01:53,606
What can I say.

604
01:01:54,167 --> 01:01:58,488
The same way they crucified Christ,
at the same place with criminals.

605
01:01:58,568 --> 01:02:00,329
But you should not compare yourself to Christ.

606
01:02:01,374 --> 01:02:03,015
Although...

607
01:02:03,696 --> 01:02:09,337
one of the criminals was sorry.

608
01:02:14,499 --> 01:02:16,661
Should I try too?

609
01:02:21,702 --> 01:02:24,583
It is the Week of the Passions,
and he brings vodka.

610
01:02:27,665 --> 01:02:29,185
But what?

611
01:02:29,785 --> 01:02:31,946
You cannot chase me away.

612
01:02:35,106 --> 01:02:38,468
Your job is of such nature,
used for untieing of sins.

613
01:02:38,588 --> 01:02:41,710
Untieing or not - 
it is not your decision.

614
01:02:44,271 --> 01:02:47,473
Then listen, priest.

615
01:03:03,558 --> 01:03:06,158
I was taken a prisoner in June.

616
01:03:08,039 --> 01:03:10,999
They proposed to me to work for the German army.

617
01:03:14,403 --> 01:03:16,844
You want to live.

618
01:03:21,965 --> 01:03:26,326
In august, our platoon was already
involved in a punishment action in Hmelnik.

619
01:03:28,687 --> 01:03:33,929
where I personally killed people
and set houses on fire.

620
01:03:35,650 --> 01:03:38,250
If I wouldn't have killed myself...

621
01:03:38,890 --> 01:03:42,612
What were you thinking when shooting defenseless people?

622
01:03:45,614 --> 01:03:48,456
Nothing.

623
01:03:51,257 --> 01:03:53,457
Keep listening.

624
01:03:57,338 --> 01:04:00,579
Together with the Germans we went
into a house.

625
01:04:01,900 --> 01:04:05,861
In the house I entered first and I found
an old man and and old lady.

626
01:04:08,422 --> 01:04:13,064
Near them there was a boy,
about 15 years old.

627
01:04:15,825 --> 01:04:21,787
The German told me: "Shoot",
and pointed his hand towards them.

628
01:04:24,029 --> 01:04:26,950
I shot three times.

629
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,150
Once for every person.

630
01:04:30,871 --> 01:04:33,071
Going towards the other side of the house,

631
01:04:36,033 --> 01:04:42,035
I saw a cradle hung-up
from the ceiling with a rope.

632
01:04:43,836 --> 01:04:48,477
There was a baby there,
one year old or younger.

633
01:04:50,959 --> 01:04:54,800
If there was a boy or a girl, I did not look.

634
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:03,443
I shot directly into him and killed him.

635
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:13,967
But you, Vladikin,
are not sorry.

636
01:05:15,408 --> 01:05:18,128
What kind of forgiveness can I give you?

637
01:05:27,932 --> 01:05:33,934
I cannot be forgiven?
Very well, we shall see.

638
01:05:41,618 --> 01:05:43,419
Pops.

639
01:05:43,499 --> 01:05:46,940
What about your soul daughter,
or grand-daughter,

640
01:05:47,020 --> 01:05:49,820
isn't she by any chance Jewish?

641
01:05:50,821 --> 01:05:54,383
Watch out, vicar.

642
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:14,911
Coming.

643
01:06:19,072 --> 01:06:23,713
Lord. God, bless.

644
01:06:27,235 --> 01:06:33,196
Stalin refused these weaklings,
and the priest is bringing them

645
01:06:36,998 --> 01:06:39,039
The Red Cross.

646
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:43,721
Go forward!
Come on!

647
01:06:48,283 --> 01:06:51,804
What do you know!
They have married the flea with the dog.

648
01:06:53,004 --> 01:06:56,566
Yes, what a comedy.

649
01:06:59,527 --> 01:07:03,449
We must quickly organize
a punishment action,

650
01:07:05,529 --> 01:07:07,410
to execute the traitor policemen.

651
01:07:07,490 --> 01:07:10,291
They are feeling good here.
They drink and pinch the girls.

652
01:07:35,181 --> 01:07:39,622
Thy resurrection...

653
01:08:45,407 --> 01:08:48,328
Can we get the priest together with them?
- Yes we can.

654
01:08:48,408 --> 01:08:51,089
He seems like a good priest.

655
01:08:51,369 --> 01:08:52,929
Comrade commissionary.

656
01:08:53,490 --> 01:08:57,090
Do not produce a German bustle,
it helps our prisoners.

657
01:08:57,892 --> 01:09:00,092
What is going on here?

658
01:09:00,212 --> 01:09:02,973
Whomever of the enemies we consider, 
they are either not problematic, or a very good person.

659
01:09:04,694 --> 01:09:06,656
The people has been left away.

660
01:09:07,696 --> 01:09:09,056
We must bring the people on the straight path.

661
01:09:40,787 --> 01:09:44,829
- Christ has risen!
- Indeed He has risen!

662
01:09:44,910 --> 01:09:48,670
- Christ has risen!
- Indeed He has risen!

663
01:09:48,750 --> 01:09:53,193
- Christ has risen!
- Indeed He has risen!

664
01:10:07,757 --> 01:10:09,959
Good. So...

665
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,959
Christ has risen!

666
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:14,040
Indeed.

667
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,360
It is meet that we kiss.

668
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:23,404
So...
- Three times.

669
01:10:30,087 --> 01:10:35,768
Look here. Send word to your parent that
he is to be careful.

670
01:10:36,328 --> 01:10:40,170
The commissioner of the platoon has been replaced.
From now on everything will change.

671
01:10:42,611 --> 01:10:47,332
You...
- Now close your eyes and put your hand forward.

672
01:11:03,819 --> 01:11:06,660
”...and there had shown, divided,
fiey tongues

673
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:09,221
that rested on each and everyone of them,

674
01:11:09,301 --> 01:11:14,063
and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit".
- Man, let me spin the earth.

675
01:11:15,303 --> 01:11:19,544
You hear man, let me spin the earth.

676
01:11:22,666 --> 01:11:26,867
What earth?
- Look, it is sitting on your table.

677
01:11:27,067 --> 01:11:31,750
Don't let him spin anything.
Give us something to eat.

678
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:34,031
For Christ.

679
01:11:37,992 --> 01:11:41,753
Where are you from?
- Leningrad, refugees.

680
01:11:41,833 --> 01:11:43,634
And what are your names?
- I am Vitea.

681
01:11:43,714 --> 01:11:45,755
I, Liudocika.
- And family names?

682
01:11:45,835 --> 01:11:47,435
Popadiin.
(Of-the-priests-wife)

683
01:11:47,515 --> 01:11:51,077
This is good, a good
trump for the wife.

684
01:11:51,277 --> 01:11:55,438
And where are you headed to?
- Where there's more bread, to the south.

685
01:11:55,638 --> 01:12:00,081
Consider that you are here.
Enter, now we are having lunch.

686
01:12:00,601 --> 01:12:04,203
What about me? I am Kolia.

687
01:12:05,563 --> 01:12:08,684
Come with us too, Kolia.

688
01:12:13,645 --> 01:12:17,527
And you will start a new life
Stop spinning.

689
01:12:17,607 --> 01:12:20,809
And the requirements will be different.

690
01:12:23,129 --> 01:12:26,330
Liudka, don't scream.
- I'm not screaming, I'm happy.

691
01:12:26,410 --> 01:12:29,131
And I say - don't scream,
it's a sin.

692
01:12:29,251 --> 01:12:32,853
Father, is it a sin to scream?

693
01:12:33,173 --> 01:12:35,413
To scream? Generally, it is not a sin.

694
01:12:35,493 --> 01:12:37,734
But it is better not to scream.

695
01:12:45,777 --> 01:12:49,940
Lord, from now on you will defend me?

696
01:13:44,080 --> 01:13:46,880
What are you waiting for? Inspiration?

697
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:37,059
Where are you going? The private is after the corner.

698
01:14:37,179 --> 01:14:39,020
It's nicer in open air.

699
01:14:39,101 --> 01:14:43,703
Last night, Lastic stepped in your "dirt".
- The pig will always find dirt.

700
01:14:54,706 --> 01:14:56,467
They're killing us!

701
01:14:56,547 --> 01:14:58,067
Sasha.

702
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:02,869
They are coming to kill us!

703
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:05,030
Why the yell?

704
01:15:05,870 --> 01:15:08,711
They are coming to kill us!
- Are you crazy?

705
01:16:09,894 --> 01:16:11,656
Don't move.

706
01:16:12,296 --> 01:16:15,338
Don't move! Stay rested!

707
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,338
Sasha.

708
01:16:22,059 --> 01:16:24,260
Are you all alive?
- Eva...

709
01:16:25,420 --> 01:16:27,341
Ready.
- Ready.

710
01:16:27,421 --> 01:16:29,221
Glory to Thee, oh Lord.

711
01:17:18,321 --> 01:17:21,762
They should be "departed", Father.

712
01:17:22,803 --> 01:17:24,643
After the custom.

713
01:17:24,963 --> 01:17:27,244
"Give them peace among Your saints?"

714
01:17:32,205 --> 01:17:37,408
I understand the pain of the relatives
and of the parents of these people.

715
01:17:37,969 --> 01:17:42,090
But, to speak openly, what have these
people deserved?

716
01:17:42,170 --> 01:17:45,890
Sincere prayers and the singing
"Give them peace among Your saints?"

717
01:17:45,971 --> 01:17:47,491
Unfortunately, no.

718
01:17:47,571 --> 01:17:50,813
Our songs and prayers will
not be sincere.

719
01:17:50,933 --> 01:17:52,813
Therefore, they will be false.

720
01:17:53,293 --> 01:17:57,815
Let us honestly acknowledge who
are the people here, in front of us?

721
01:17:57,896 --> 01:18:03,138
They are the betrayers of the country
and killers of innocent people.

722
01:18:12,341 --> 01:18:18,223
Oh, Sasha, Sasha,
What are you doing?

723
01:18:19,703 --> 01:18:22,865
Why have you gathered a pack of children?

724
01:18:23,185 --> 01:18:25,946
So you will behave like this?

725
01:18:29,106 --> 01:18:31,348
Have you ever thought how

726
01:18:32,069 --> 01:18:35,870
am I going to manage without you?

727
01:18:36,230 --> 01:18:37,310
Don't be afraid, Alivna.

728
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:42,313
Our children are smart, on the contrary,
they will be a support for you.

729
01:18:43,353 --> 01:18:46,874
When I will be no more.
- Don't you dare!

730
01:18:50,915 --> 01:18:54,037
Don't you dare speak so.

731
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:06,201
I will rest in the grave as soon as...
- It's not necessary, Alia.

732
01:19:06,321 --> 01:19:09,603
...as soon as you will not be.
- It's not necessary.

733
01:19:09,724 --> 01:19:12,004
I'm already afraid.

734
01:19:12,724 --> 01:19:17,886
It would have been better to be afraid
when you were saying those unbecoming things.

735
01:19:20,766 --> 01:19:24,207
It would have been worse if I would have
"departed" those policemen.

736
01:19:25,328 --> 01:19:27,049
You didn't need to "depart" them.

737
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:28,890
Or if you would have, it would not make a difference.

738
01:19:28,970 --> 01:19:33,252
Forgive me, Lord.

739
01:19:33,332 --> 01:19:36,572
Why did you have to speak like that.
Everyone heard.

740
01:19:40,653 --> 01:19:45,777
Aliuska, God is merciful.

741
01:19:45,857 --> 01:19:49,057
Maybe He will spare me this time as well.

742
01:20:08,264 --> 01:20:09,945
Faster!

743
01:20:18,149 --> 01:20:23,230
The pedestal did not come up too bad!

744
01:20:23,350 --> 01:20:24,951
Picture!

745
01:20:27,152 --> 01:20:30,914
Left shoulder forward!

746
01:20:44,998 --> 01:20:48,199
Metropolitan Serghie...
- Bless, vladica.

747
01:20:55,843 --> 01:20:58,564
Father Alexander, how come you are here?

748
01:20:58,644 --> 01:21:01,085
Today I wanted to come by.

749
01:21:01,165 --> 01:21:02,926
Bless, vladica.

750
01:21:09,208 --> 01:21:10,328
To be honest...

751
01:21:10,408 --> 01:21:12,368
I was going to Mr. Colonel.

752
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:15,529
It's unpleasant over there, at Siraia Nizina.
In the concentration camp...

753
01:21:16,449 --> 01:21:18,771
About unpleasantness we will speak later.

754
01:21:19,291 --> 01:21:21,412
It is great joy in Moscow.

755
01:21:21,732 --> 01:21:24,133
Metropolitan Serghie Stargorodskii...
- Patriarch?

756
01:21:24,213 --> 01:21:27,694
Yes. He  was elected Patriarch of Moscow 
and of the whole Russia.

757
01:21:27,774 --> 01:21:29,856
God, what joy.

758
01:21:31,256 --> 01:21:32,937
And now?

759
01:21:33,178 --> 01:21:36,378
Now I am being asked to judge him

760
01:21:36,499 --> 01:21:39,499
and not to recognize the choice of the Patriarch in Moscow.

761
01:21:39,619 --> 01:21:42,860
And you?
- What about me?

762
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:49,062
I am managing as I can and I hope in the mercy of the Lord.

763
01:21:49,863 --> 01:21:52,465
Tell him about the letter.

764
01:21:52,905 --> 01:21:56,105
See that you don't let him enjoy it
and spoil it for him.

765
01:21:56,265 --> 01:21:59,906
What to spoil?
It is better that he reads it alone.

766
01:22:06,310 --> 01:22:10,871
A copy.
Mr. Freihausen tried his best.

767
01:22:15,552 --> 01:22:18,313
"The condemnation of the traitors of the Faith and of the Country...

768
01:22:18,473 --> 01:22:22,396
Among the priests there are those,
that, forgetting to be afraid of God,

769
01:22:22,756 --> 01:22:25,917
Like Judas, losing his soul...

770
01:22:27,917 --> 01:22:29,678
The Holy Orthodox Church

771
01:22:30,038 --> 01:22:32,999
established punishment for traitors

772
01:22:34,639 --> 01:22:40,283
and has decided:

773
01:22:40,363 --> 01:22:43,963
whomsoever was found guilty of betrayal
will be excommunicated.

774
01:22:45,764 --> 01:22:49,246
I confirm the original.
The Secretary of the Patriarchy of Moscow."

775
01:22:49,966 --> 01:22:51,366
It follows that we...

776
01:22:51,446 --> 01:22:54,648
You must not take it literally.

777
01:22:55,088 --> 01:22:58,169
I could have not shown you the decision.

778
01:22:58,249 --> 01:23:00,690
Especially since it arrived illegaly to us.

779
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:04,611
I want everyone to understand one thing.

780
01:23:04,731 --> 01:23:08,452
For us, all stays as it was.

781
01:23:08,532 --> 01:23:10,533
To the Lord what's of the Lord,
and to Caesar what belongs to the Caesar.

782
01:23:10,653 --> 01:23:14,134
Vladica, they will only chase us and your mission.

783
01:23:14,214 --> 01:23:16,376
Best case scenario.

784
01:23:16,616 --> 01:23:18,217
The game is over.

785
01:23:18,977 --> 01:23:21,218
The time has come to pay the bills.

786
01:23:21,418 --> 01:23:23,939
But we don't owe anybody anything.

787
01:23:24,019 --> 01:23:27,100
And the bills, dear Mr.
Ivan Fiodorovici,

788
01:23:27,180 --> 01:23:29,621
we will pay them in a totally different place.

789
01:23:30,021 --> 01:23:31,942
What do you say, Father Alexander?

790
01:23:32,062 --> 01:23:34,742
Neither the Germans, nor the bolsheviks
are eternal.

791
01:23:34,862 --> 01:23:37,223
But only one Jesus Christ.
To Him we will give settlement.

792
01:23:37,343 --> 01:23:43,265
This in another life.
But now, what do you command that we do?

793
01:23:43,465 --> 01:23:45,386
Save the children.

794
01:23:57,032 --> 01:24:01,073
Grandfather, where are we going?
- I told you, haven't I?

795
01:24:01,273 --> 01:24:03,473
We will live together in the village Zakati.

796
01:24:03,794 --> 01:24:06,674
A great village,
with good people.

797
01:24:07,114 --> 01:24:10,755
The places are very beautiful.
There is the church were I have my service.

798
01:24:10,875 --> 01:24:12,597
You will all go to the Church.

799
01:24:12,717 --> 01:24:15,919
But isn't the church frightening?
Won't they take our blood over there?

800
01:24:15,999 --> 01:24:17,839
But what, they took blood from you?

801
01:24:17,919 --> 01:24:21,320
Yes. From all of us the Germans took blood.

802
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:25,041
They were saying that the German children
did not have enough blood,

803
01:24:25,121 --> 01:24:28,604
that is why we must give them our blood.

804
01:24:28,804 --> 01:24:30,244
Holy Lord.

805
01:24:30,324 --> 01:24:33,685
Nobody will take your blood.
I will see to it.

806
01:24:33,765 --> 01:24:38,246
- You are not lieing?
- I never lie, because I'm a priest.

807
01:24:42,407 --> 01:24:47,811
Behold, our church.
Behold how high and beautiful she is.

808
01:24:54,532 --> 01:24:57,533
Don't worry, Aliona.
The children are not for us.

809
01:24:57,613 --> 01:24:59,454
We will give them to the parishioners.

810
01:24:59,854 --> 01:25:01,216
Good day.

811
01:25:01,296 --> 01:25:05,257
You try and give away the baby kittens, when the cat has them!
And these are children.

812
01:25:05,377 --> 01:25:07,578
They will take them immediately.

813
01:25:07,698 --> 01:25:10,898
We will see.
- There's nothing to see.

814
01:25:10,978 --> 01:25:13,980
If you would have brought 2 or 3...
but... they are a whole bunch.

815
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:18,502
Heavenly Empress,
where did you gather them from?

816
01:25:18,582 --> 01:25:20,863
The Germans have a children's
concentration camp, at Salaspils.

817
01:25:20,943 --> 01:25:22,583
The Metropolitan Serghie asked the officials,

818
01:25:22,663 --> 01:25:26,984
to send these little ones at the priests
from the orthodox mission in Pskov.

819
01:25:28,665 --> 01:25:31,025
What are you staring at?
Go inside the house.

820
01:25:34,867 --> 01:25:36,228
What a joy.

821
01:25:36,309 --> 01:25:39,190
Vladica told me that in Moscow they
elected a Patriarch


822
01:25:39,270 --> 01:25:41,071
Serghie Starogorodski.

823
01:25:41,871 --> 01:25:46,072
How so? While the soviets are in power?

824
01:25:46,152 --> 01:25:47,673
Just like that...

825
01:25:47,793 --> 01:25:51,715
For the fact that they have elected a
Patriarch I believe it is also our merit.

826
01:25:52,395 --> 01:25:54,435
It is, but not towards your honesty.

827
01:25:55,796 --> 01:25:57,276
What's with you?

828
01:25:57,356 --> 01:26:00,877
Like so. Play.

829
01:26:01,397 --> 01:26:06,279
- A letter. From our sons.

830
01:26:06,599 --> 01:26:09,961
Give it.

831
01:26:12,603 --> 01:26:14,163
Thank vladica Serghie.

832
01:26:14,243 --> 01:26:17,924
Don't be afraid, Mother Alevtina
is severe, but very good.

833
01:26:18,004 --> 01:26:19,805
Let's go.

834
01:26:21,486 --> 01:26:23,127
Come on, come on.

835
01:26:44,054 --> 01:26:47,616
Well, let's meet.

836
01:26:49,016 --> 01:26:53,658
Oh, you hungry wolves.

837
01:26:54,338 --> 01:26:57,579
Me too.
- Me too.

838
01:27:24,430 --> 01:27:27,511
Good day, Father.
- Good day.

839
01:27:34,593 --> 01:27:38,074
Eva, where has Father gone?

840
01:27:38,154 --> 01:27:43,397
To Tiskovo. To baptize the children.
He is the only one in the whole region.

841
01:27:47,998 --> 01:27:52,439
You wanted to ask about Herod.
- Why was he beating children?

842
01:27:52,559 --> 01:27:54,560
Young Herod?

843
01:27:54,640 --> 01:27:56,561
Because he was evil.

844
01:27:57,041 --> 01:28:01,803
Fascist?
- You can call it that.

845
01:28:01,883 --> 01:28:03,084
He was afraid of Christ,

846
01:28:03,164 --> 01:28:05,725
and Christ was among the newly-born.

847
01:28:05,805 --> 01:28:08,526
And he decided to kill all of them.

848
01:28:28,733 --> 01:28:30,534
Mother Alevtina.

849
01:28:30,654 --> 01:28:33,216
Don't be angry with me please,

850
01:28:33,576 --> 01:28:38,018
but it would be better if you don't sing
the Cherub Song (Heruvic) with us in choir.

851
01:28:40,138 --> 01:28:44,020
How so, not to sing?
- Don't get angry, I'm begging you.

852
01:28:44,140 --> 01:28:46,181
You sing everything well,

853
01:28:46,341 --> 01:28:50,942
but the Heruvic does not come good.
And everyone messes up.

854
01:28:54,183 --> 01:28:58,944
How so,
the Heruvic does not come good?

855
01:28:59,985 --> 01:29:01,947
What are you saying?!

856
01:29:03,467 --> 01:29:06,868
One year since you are a Christian,
but you are teaching the priest's wife.

857
01:29:07,188 --> 01:29:08,909
I can't believe it!

858
01:29:09,229 --> 01:29:11,110
Mother...

859
01:29:11,790 --> 01:29:14,151
How to...

860
01:29:21,153 --> 01:29:23,074
Eva.

861
01:29:32,798 --> 01:29:36,879
Verify if it is holding.
- It looks OK.

862
01:29:40,120 --> 01:29:43,121
No, it's very tight.

863
01:30:16,493 --> 01:30:22,497
Father, precious.
There it is bad. There they are preparing for execution.

864
01:30:23,137 --> 01:30:24,577
Hold for a moment.

865
01:30:34,461 --> 01:30:36,382
Lord, bless.

866
01:30:37,863 --> 01:30:42,824
Home, go home.

867
01:30:44,984 --> 01:30:47,025
Sasha, don't go.

868
01:30:51,187 --> 01:30:53,788
Herr oberst. Ivan Fiodorovici.

869
01:30:59,351 --> 01:31:01,312
Father Alexander!

870
01:31:03,232 --> 01:31:05,353
Christians!

871
01:31:06,873 --> 01:31:08,874
And you Germans, and you Russians.

872
01:31:09,475 --> 01:31:13,676
We all are children of our mother the Church.
Be merciful.

873
01:31:13,756 --> 01:31:18,317
Don't execute these young boys,
full of life, and this girl.

874
01:31:18,397 --> 01:31:20,837
After all, Christ is present here, unseen.

875
01:31:20,958 --> 01:31:24,119
He is with the executed,
not with the ones who execute.

876
01:31:24,239 --> 01:31:29,602
Mr. Frehausen, help me.
- Go home, Father Alexander.

877
01:31:30,403 --> 01:31:32,683
Our Lord God, Jesus Christ...

878
01:31:32,964 --> 01:31:36,204
If you want...
- Don't touch him!

879
01:31:36,284 --> 01:31:38,765
He is under the protection of the ReichMinister.

880
01:31:38,846 --> 01:31:40,086
Let him go.

881
01:31:42,407 --> 01:31:44,047
Leave.

882
01:32:01,094 --> 01:32:05,496
Don't look, Father Alexander.

883
01:32:09,937 --> 01:32:14,419
Don't look, go.

884
01:32:14,819 --> 01:32:16,459
Start the car.

885
01:32:27,784 --> 01:32:29,345
Stop them.

886
01:32:32,105 --> 01:32:33,586
Halt!

887
01:32:43,910 --> 01:32:48,271
Push this damn car!

888
01:33:44,612 --> 01:33:48,215
And the little willows are given
from God too?

889
01:33:48,695 --> 01:33:49,815
Surely.

890
01:33:49,895 --> 01:33:51,416
It is said in the Scriptures that
from the beginning

891
01:33:51,496 --> 01:33:56,298
God gave people, as food, all kinds of seeds,

892
01:33:56,778 --> 01:33:58,858
fruits and others.

893
01:33:58,978 --> 01:34:02,260
You should be praying.

894
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:05,461
I'm out of power, Aliuska.
- What happened?

895
01:34:05,661 --> 01:34:10,982
What happened? What happened?

896
01:34:16,344 --> 01:34:18,626
Pay attention here.

897
01:34:19,706 --> 01:34:23,467
I am asking for forgiveness
that I was required...
- Get out.

898
01:34:25,348 --> 01:34:30,670
Believe me, Father Alexander,
It is not easy for me either.

899
01:34:31,150 --> 01:34:36,273
But to fulfill your request was impossible.
And you understand this.

900
01:34:36,353 --> 01:34:38,313
Get out of my house.

901
01:34:42,474 --> 01:34:44,315
Forgive me.

902
01:34:45,316 --> 01:34:47,556
Ivan Fiodorovici...
- Don't you dare!

903
01:34:53,719 --> 01:34:58,640
He pushed. You understand?
He pushed.

904
01:35:02,122 --> 01:35:05,083
Behold, I am bringing some wood. So you may warm up.

905
01:35:12,446 --> 01:35:15,728
Where are the people?
- To work, at coal.

906
01:35:16,528 --> 01:35:18,168
I take.

907
01:35:25,851 --> 01:35:27,251
Halt.

908
01:35:27,652 --> 01:35:29,012
Back.

909
01:35:29,092 --> 01:35:31,212
Turn back.
We will take these.

910
01:35:31,292 --> 01:35:32,733
Leave, I said!

911
01:35:32,853 --> 01:35:35,854
What's going on? Last time they took everything
and gave it to the prisoners.

912
01:35:36,254 --> 01:35:38,056
Mother, ask.

913
01:35:42,818 --> 01:35:44,619
Come here.

914
01:35:45,139 --> 01:35:50,100
Mr. Commander...Why?
- It's not permitted.

915
01:35:50,340 --> 01:35:54,142
You are not following the rules.

916
01:35:54,342 --> 01:35:57,943
Please, Mr. Commander.

917
01:35:58,583 --> 01:36:01,504
You want to step over rules all the time.

918
01:36:01,664 --> 01:36:05,545
It is not permitted, you understand?

919
01:36:05,665 --> 01:36:08,426
The German soldiers are freezing.
Translate.

920
01:36:08,706 --> 01:36:11,149
He is saying that the German army is missing

921
01:36:11,229 --> 01:36:13,270
warm clothes and provisions.

922
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:15,791
They have permitted to leave wood for
warming up the baracks.

923
01:36:15,871 --> 01:36:16,951
How so?

924
01:36:17,031 --> 01:36:20,632
If only would have used the wool socks,
it would have been enough for all the prisoners.

925
01:36:20,712 --> 01:36:21,992
They took everything.

926
01:36:22,112 --> 01:36:26,154
Although, mother, if they've come to rely on our socks...

927
01:36:26,234 --> 01:36:28,755
It means they are not so well.

928
01:36:33,396 --> 01:36:35,517
Where has she gone?

929
01:36:35,597 --> 01:36:38,557
He is neither at Cehovi, nor at Proklovi.

930
01:36:38,837 --> 01:36:40,919
Not at Dorofeevi either.

931
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:45,241
Yesterday she was complaining that her
head was hurting very badly.

932
01:36:45,361 --> 01:36:46,922
All day she has not touched food.

933
01:36:47,002 --> 01:36:50,843
All of the sudden she remembered how often she upset me,
and started asking for forgiveness.

934
01:36:50,924 --> 01:36:54,124
When I wanted to hug her,
she said that there is no reason for hugs.

935
01:36:54,244 --> 01:36:56,405
True. Her head was hurting.

936
01:36:56,485 --> 01:36:59,887
At night she slept alone, in the other room.

937
01:37:03,528 --> 01:37:04,568
Go.

938
01:37:04,648 --> 01:37:07,969
I'm going to check at Zavialovi.
- OK.

939
01:37:16,533 --> 01:37:18,613
We must go search for her again.

940
01:37:19,454 --> 01:37:21,854
We should take some dogs.
- What dogs?

941
01:37:21,974 --> 01:37:23,656
Father, a letter.

942
01:37:23,976 --> 01:37:26,697
A letter from mother.
- From where?

943
01:37:26,777 --> 01:37:28,617
Where was it hidden?

944
01:37:28,737 --> 01:37:31,699
I found it into the Gospel.
It says: Father Alexander.

945
01:37:38,061 --> 01:37:41,382
"My precious and beloved husband Sasha

946
01:37:41,502 --> 01:37:44,543
When I was the last time 
to the concentration camp

947
01:37:44,663 --> 01:37:47,385
I believe I got sick with typhus.

948
01:37:47,465 --> 01:37:51,106
I cannot afford to endanger you
and our children.

949
01:37:54,867 --> 01:37:56,187
Lord, Lord.

950
01:37:56,267 --> 01:37:57,667
"This is not suicide,

951
01:37:57,747 --> 01:38:02,310
because I am not undertaking anything against myself,
I am only leaving.

952
01:38:02,390 --> 01:38:05,792
...because I am not undertaking anything against myself,
I am only leaving.

953
01:38:06,312 --> 01:38:08,393
I am only leaving...

954
01:38:10,794 --> 01:38:15,515
I will reach somewhere,
I will go through with the disease and then be well.

955
01:38:17,316 --> 01:38:22,358
It would be a greater sin to get you
sick with good knowledge.

956
01:38:28,039 --> 01:38:29,919
To you I want to say -

957
01:38:30,039 --> 01:38:32,720
that I haven't loved anyone in my life
as I have loved you,

958
01:38:32,840 --> 01:38:36,484
and I haven't met a better man than yourself.

959
01:38:41,165 --> 01:38:46,527
I have upset you very much with
all kinds of deeds and with my stubbornness.

960
01:38:46,647 --> 01:38:48,767
Please forgive me.

961
01:38:48,847 --> 01:38:50,048
Now...

962
01:38:50,169 --> 01:38:53,129
you must take much care of 
yourself, stay away

963
01:38:53,209 --> 01:38:58,651
from daring and unthought deeds,
because I am no more.

964
01:38:58,731 --> 01:39:02,132
All responsibility is on your shoulders.

965
01:39:08,095 --> 01:39:09,936
To all our children,

966
01:39:10,337 --> 01:39:14,658
to Vasia, Mitia,
Andriusha, Danilushka

967
01:39:14,738 --> 01:39:16,418
and to our soul children,

968
01:39:16,498 --> 01:39:19,979
Eva, Vitea, Ludmila,
and Kolia,

969
01:39:20,179 --> 01:39:25,101
to Vitalik and Lena,
send them my blessing.

970
01:39:25,181 --> 01:39:28,102
To remember me with only nice memories.

971
01:39:32,304 --> 01:39:34,505
Let's go with God.

972
01:39:34,585 --> 01:39:38,867
Elsa, Nocika, come on.

973
01:39:44,268 --> 01:39:48,670
I'm a stupid woman.
Lord, if only I get out of here.

974
01:39:49,070 --> 01:39:52,872
Help me, oh Lord, help me.

975
01:39:52,952 --> 01:39:54,793
I hope that you, Sashenka

976
01:39:54,993 --> 01:39:59,794
will pray so that God will grant you
the forgiveness of all my sins

977
01:39:59,914 --> 01:40:05,797
and to grant rest in peace in a quiet place,
in a clean place...


978
01:40:06,077 --> 01:40:08,677
There we will meet again.

979
01:40:08,798 --> 01:40:14,720
I love you. 
Your sharpener

980
01:42:19,607 --> 01:42:22,248
That's where you want?

981
01:42:25,890 --> 01:42:28,610
Sasha.
- Aliuska.

982
01:42:50,019 --> 01:42:52,299
You want to strengthen me?

983
01:42:54,461 --> 01:42:57,142
Aliuska, I miss you so much.

984
01:42:57,982 --> 01:43:00,583
I have told you so rarely that I love you.

985
01:43:01,303 --> 01:43:05,505
I love you very much,
my Aliuska.

986
01:43:06,065 --> 01:43:09,066
I wish so much to come to you
so fast.

987
01:43:13,347 --> 01:43:16,067
Why have you gone in the forrest?

988
01:43:17,389 --> 01:43:20,631
What have you done, my little sparrow?

989
01:43:23,672 --> 01:43:27,833
This will be the best photograph made
by me in Russia.

990
01:43:35,395 --> 01:43:37,357
Lift the gun a little bit.

991
01:43:37,877 --> 01:43:39,397
That is good.

992
01:43:40,798 --> 01:43:43,118
Hey you, come here.
- Me?

993
01:43:43,718 --> 01:43:45,999
Yes,you.

994
01:43:49,560 --> 01:43:52,122
You are a Father and I am a Father too.

995
01:43:52,363 --> 01:43:54,084
Wait.

996
01:43:58,445 --> 01:44:01,366
This is Mary and Joseph. Do you understand?
- Christmas.

997
01:44:06,527 --> 01:44:08,809
Take a picture of me and him.

998
01:44:20,533 --> 01:44:22,013
Wait.

999
01:44:22,733 --> 01:44:24,695
I brought gifts for the prisoners.

1000
01:44:25,655 --> 01:44:26,655
Go away.

1001
01:44:26,775 --> 01:44:29,577
Mother is no more, there's no one to translate.

1002
01:44:29,937 --> 01:44:32,298
I arrived at the orders of colonel Freihausen.

1003
01:44:32,378 --> 01:44:34,858
Oberst Freihausen.

1004
01:44:34,978 --> 01:44:36,539
You stupid man.

1005
01:44:38,339 --> 01:44:41,981
It's Christmas.

1006
01:44:42,701 --> 01:44:44,462
Do you understand?

1007
01:44:45,262 --> 01:44:49,944
Vaineht, in your language.
- Ja, Vaineht.

1008
01:44:50,144 --> 01:44:52,745
And we're all sitting here like idiots. Leave.

1009
01:44:53,185 --> 01:44:54,905
Leave, old idiot.

1010
01:44:57,707 --> 01:44:59,587
Stepan.

1011
01:45:01,468 --> 01:45:04,590
Stiopa, come so I'll give you the basket.

1012
01:45:04,670 --> 01:45:09,031
Father Alexander, leave. Typhos.

1013
01:45:20,956 --> 01:45:23,717
Lord will help take it, then he will stay alive.

1014
01:45:23,797 --> 01:45:25,717
Lord.

1015
01:45:39,923 --> 01:45:43,043
Silent night, holy night.

1016
01:45:43,645 --> 01:45:46,486
Shepherds quake at the sight.

1017
01:45:46,646 --> 01:45:48,807
Heavenly hosts sing Hallelujah.

1018
01:45:48,887 --> 01:45:51,568
Christ, the Saviour is born.

1019
01:46:41,625 --> 01:46:44,387
It's only me - one...

1020
01:46:46,227 --> 01:46:49,830
Father, let's head home.

1021
01:46:49,910 --> 01:46:52,111
How long have you been here?

1022
01:46:53,151 --> 01:46:57,952
Truly. Not to mention that it was said:
Why do you search Me here?

1023
01:46:59,072 --> 01:47:03,195
She is not in the earth, 
but in unknown realms.

1024
01:47:11,278 --> 01:47:14,638
Who will be my sharpener from now on? You tell me...

1025
01:47:14,758 --> 01:47:16,799
There's no need, Father.

1026
01:47:17,199 --> 01:47:21,001
It's true, my daughter.
The living must live.

1027
01:47:22,401 --> 01:47:26,883
You, I know, you are seeing Aleksei Lugotintev secretly.

1028
01:47:27,724 --> 01:47:31,205
Marry him, ladybug.
He is a good boy.

1029
01:47:31,325 --> 01:47:34,845
There will be new times and
you will be like Adam and Eva.

1030
01:47:37,607 --> 01:47:40,689
The ancestors of a new seed.

1031
01:47:41,369 --> 01:47:45,730
You know that Lioska calls me, like yourself, ladybug.

1032
01:47:46,891 --> 01:47:49,611
What, you arrived and are not coming inside?

1033
01:47:49,691 --> 01:47:52,413
You threw me out last time.

1034
01:47:54,053 --> 01:47:56,254
OK, let's come inside. What need is there to hold the evil.

1035
01:47:56,374 --> 01:48:00,336
I brought you icecream.
As in Riga, do you remember?

1036
01:48:00,536 --> 01:48:02,937
Icecream? We're during fasting.

1037
01:48:03,097 --> 01:48:05,897
Only to bring a little joy, to the children.

1038
01:48:06,497 --> 01:48:08,780
I also brought candles.

1039
01:48:26,425 --> 01:48:28,666
They baptized me.

1040
01:48:29,466 --> 01:48:32,707
He is a Letonian.
- You are a Letonian!

1041
01:48:33,387 --> 01:48:35,949
Vitas, Vitas-bitas-dritas.
It was Vitas.

1042
01:48:36,069 --> 01:48:37,550
Now he is the servant of God Vitalii.

1043
01:48:37,630 --> 01:48:40,272
And I will give icecream to someone.

1044
01:48:45,713 --> 01:48:49,914
When I was active here, they have 
baptized me as well, before everything.


1045
01:48:50,034 --> 01:48:52,075
Listen to him: "when I was active".

1046
01:48:52,875 --> 01:48:54,957
Kolia, you will become a priest.

1047
01:48:59,678 --> 01:49:05,400
Oh Lord, rest the soul of your servant Alevtina.

1048
01:49:06,441 --> 01:49:09,161
You must think about it.

1049
01:49:10,121 --> 01:49:13,084
The campaign of the year 1943 failed.

1050
01:49:14,044 --> 01:49:17,605
The Rosenberg department is making pressures.

1051
01:49:18,486 --> 01:49:23,447
It's decided that the priests of the 
orthodox mission in Pskov

1052
01:49:23,527 --> 01:49:29,129
have the obligation to make daily services
and pray for the victory of the German army.

1053
01:49:29,209 --> 01:49:32,850
They are starting to believe in
the power of our prayer?
- This is not important.

1054
01:49:33,050 --> 01:49:35,332
But in this way it will be better for yourself.

1055
01:49:35,572 --> 01:49:37,532
And you believe I will agree?

1056
01:49:37,612 --> 01:49:40,693
It will be better to ... in the concentration camp 
it is a typhus epidemy.

1057
01:49:40,773 --> 01:49:42,655
They don't let me go in there.

1058
01:49:42,775 --> 01:49:46,417
Forget, Father Alexander.
What kind of concentration camp?

1059
01:49:46,497 --> 01:49:48,257
They will take it down very fast.

1060
01:49:48,337 --> 01:49:50,378
And the Pskov mission.

1061
01:49:52,058 --> 01:49:54,059
Now I understand.

1062
01:49:54,259 --> 01:49:56,819
They want to get us even more dirty, in the end?

1063
01:49:58,060 --> 01:50:01,821
As you were saying? The game is over.

1064
01:50:02,863 --> 01:50:05,143
My dear Father.

1065
01:50:05,623 --> 01:50:08,304
Think about your numerous family.

1066
01:50:09,744 --> 01:50:12,785
My family is under the covering of the
Mother of God.

1067
01:50:15,107 --> 01:50:19,028
It's better for the Germans to shoot me,
instead of ours, when they will come.

1068
01:50:20,068 --> 01:50:22,910
I will take care of everything.

1069
01:50:24,110 --> 01:50:27,031
Your family will be evacuated
in Germany.

1070
01:50:27,151 --> 01:50:29,111
I don't want to leave for Germany.

1071
01:50:30,713 --> 01:50:32,834
The children are not going either.

1072
01:50:33,554 --> 01:50:37,155
The Germans took their blood.

1073
01:50:37,275 --> 01:50:39,436
They said for Germany's children.

1074
01:50:41,356 --> 01:50:43,077
How can one understand something like this?

1075
01:50:45,477 --> 01:50:48,239
One must not understand this in any way.

1076
01:50:50,920 --> 01:50:53,040
Father Alexander.

1077
01:50:55,121 --> 01:50:57,082
Take my confession.

1078
01:51:08,007 --> 01:51:08,007
I am German,

1079
01:51:08,607 --> 01:51:09,688
Father.

1080
01:51:09,808 --> 01:51:12,048
I work for my people.

1081
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:14,729
The fate breaks me in two.

1082
01:51:17,329 --> 01:51:19,411
Forgive my solemn style.

1083
01:51:20,811 --> 01:51:23,132
Let us say farewell like Christians.

1084
01:51:28,974 --> 01:51:30,975
May God save you.

1085
01:51:42,020 --> 01:51:44,900
This is food for our eagles.

1086
01:51:46,301 --> 01:51:50,022
The priest was leaving well.
- Look at how many children he has.

1087
01:51:54,304 --> 01:51:57,786
Sasok, if you would have beaten the German as
you cut wood...

1088
01:51:58,106 --> 01:52:00,106
I did not beat them!

1089
01:52:02,827 --> 01:52:05,268
Vladimir Ilici returns from the forest.

1090
01:52:11,551 --> 01:52:14,632
Where should we take?
- In the nextdoor house.

1091
01:52:15,352 --> 01:52:16,752
Hello, ladybug.

1092
01:52:16,832 --> 01:52:20,113
I see that they are throwing you out.

1093
01:52:21,674 --> 01:52:23,595
Mother says that, in case of something, you can
come stay with us.

1094
01:52:23,915 --> 01:52:26,117
Hello, Liosa.

1095
01:52:26,317 --> 01:52:28,477
Now it's the major state here.

1096
01:52:28,997 --> 01:52:30,958
We'll stay at Vladikini for a while.

1097
01:52:31,078 --> 01:52:33,839
Truly, there, the heater blows out smoke,
but it's OK, cause it's summer.

1098
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:41,282
You look good in uniform.
The horse looks good too.

1099
01:52:41,802 --> 01:52:43,763
It's the commander's horse.

1100
01:52:44,083 --> 01:52:46,964
Where's Father Alexander?
I have great need of him.

1101
01:52:47,044 --> 01:52:50,285
He has not told me, but I believe
he is at Siraia Nizina.

1102
01:52:56,888 --> 01:52:58,569
But you have changed.

1103
01:53:00,249 --> 01:53:02,330
You're like...

1104
01:53:12,453 --> 01:53:18,375
Holy Immortal, have mercy on us.

1105
01:53:19,656 --> 01:53:22,577
Holy God,

1106
01:53:24,298 --> 01:53:27,500
Holy Mighty,

1107
01:53:28,741 --> 01:53:33,302
Holy Immortal,

1108
01:53:33,382 --> 01:53:36,342
have mercy on us.

1109
01:53:38,743 --> 01:53:41,825
Rest oh Lord, the souls of your sleeping ones.

1110
01:53:42,225 --> 01:53:43,985
Father Alexander!

1111
01:53:44,065 --> 01:53:46,626
You must leave, Father Alexander.

1112
01:53:46,906 --> 01:53:51,187
All the priests that held services during
the occupation will be arrested.

1113
01:53:51,307 --> 01:53:55,070
They are lucky if they get sent to concentration camps.
But they can also send them straight in front of the wall.

1114
01:53:58,632 --> 01:54:01,033
Look, you see?

1115
01:54:03,153 --> 01:54:07,994
Lord...
What is happening?

1116
01:54:08,194 --> 01:54:10,875
Where am I going to depart to?

1117
01:54:11,075 --> 01:54:14,957
Haven't run away from the Germans,
will I run away from mine?

1118
01:54:24,761 --> 01:54:28,882
Well, priest? How many people have you taken 
confessions of here?

1119
01:54:29,524 --> 01:54:31,084
I have not counted.

1120
01:54:31,964 --> 01:54:34,885
Now here we will take your confession.

1121
01:54:41,127 --> 01:54:45,409
Too bad, now there seems to be sympathy for you useless breed.

1122
01:54:45,529 --> 01:54:48,330
I can't even touch the church.

1123
01:54:51,411 --> 01:54:56,813
Listen. You sign this
confession.

1124
01:54:57,013 --> 01:54:59,293
That you have collaborated
with the hitlerists,

1125
01:54:59,413 --> 01:55:03,975
It will be simpler for you, and for us...
- This is for sure.

1126
01:55:04,937 --> 01:55:07,697
I want it to be as simple as possible too.

1127
01:55:08,858 --> 01:55:11,938
But think about it,
How could I lie about myself?

1128
01:55:12,018 --> 01:55:16,500
All I did was praying for the deliverance of the land from our enemies.

1129
01:55:16,820 --> 01:55:21,903
I took provisions, clothes
to the concentration camps where our prisoners were.

1130
01:55:21,983 --> 01:55:27,624
It is not my fault that the Germans were taking half.

1131
01:55:28,105 --> 01:55:30,985
I helped ours. As I could...

1132
01:55:55,996 --> 01:55:58,196
Everybody go home.

1133
01:55:58,796 --> 01:56:01,317
Release our Father.

1134
01:56:02,997 --> 01:56:05,119
I don't have the right.
- Please.

1135
01:56:05,199 --> 01:56:06,999
Leave at once.

1136
01:56:07,079 --> 01:56:11,000
- If you want, take my blood.
- What am I going to to with your blood?

1137
01:56:11,080 --> 01:56:14,041
Please.
Take all my blood.

1138
01:56:14,121 --> 01:56:18,404
Go away from here, useless priestly creatures.

1139
01:56:27,007 --> 01:56:32,769
Father...
- Take care of the children, ladybug.

1140
01:56:47,054 --> 01:56:53,018
He won't go much with you.
Up to Tishkov. There they will take him.

1141
01:58:50,661 --> 01:58:53,102
Hell, I forgot the umbrella.

1142
01:58:53,382 --> 01:58:57,023
What umbrella? Yesterday it was sunny.

1143
01:58:58,904 --> 01:59:00,264
Old man.

1144
01:59:02,105 --> 01:59:06,266
Pops, I'm speaking to you.

1145
01:59:07,228 --> 01:59:09,508
Can you eat in your monastery?

1146
01:59:12,110 --> 01:59:16,632
I think it's going to rain.
What about young monks, do you have any?

1147
01:59:16,712 --> 01:59:20,713
What monks!
Can we take shelter?

1148
01:59:21,913 --> 01:59:24,274
Look how it's raining.

1149
01:59:28,595 --> 01:59:31,916
Rain while travelling...it's a good sign.

1150
01:59:33,957 --> 01:59:37,119
Come in children. We shall see.

1151
02:00:22,817 --> 02:00:27,818
Father Aleksandr Ionin finished his sentence in the camps, 
sharing the fate of many priests from the orthodox mission in Pskov.
 
1152
02:00:30,819 --> 02:00:35,821
On April 29th 1944, the Metropolitan Serghie Voskresenski was killed by the fascists
on the way from Vilnius to Kaunas.

1153
02:00:39,823 --> 02:00:45,824
Aleksei Lugotintev and Eva got married and raised all their 
children and the soul children of Father Alexander.

1154
02:00:47,825 --> 02:00:54,828
Kolia Romanov became priest at the church 
Saint Aleksandr Nevski from the village Zacati.

1155
02:00:57,828 --> 02:01:02,832
In the '70s, colonel Freihausen
published his memoirs.

1156
02:01:04,832 --> 02:01:08,834
With regards to Father Alexander he hasn't
mentioned a word.

1157
02:01:15,836 --> 02:01:20,837
After the book of Aleksandr Segeni, The Priest (Pop)
