00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,400
THE SILENCE OF THE SEA

2
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,600
To the memory
of Saint-Paul Roux murdered poet 

3
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:52,000
This film doesn't have the pretense
of contributing a solution to the problem

4
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,800
of the relationships between France and Germany
problems that lasted

5
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,600
I release time for the crimes of the Nazi barbarism

6
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,000
perpetrated with the complicity of the German town

7
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
and that they will be in the memory of the men...

8
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,800
It left,

9
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,400
she/he underwent

10
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,400
as the other ones

11
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,600
as all the other ones

12
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:39,200
as all their unhappy town

13
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,200
it tried to fix in my memory
all that happened during those 6 months

14
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,400
the veiled ones, their words,
and that rebellion that that man didn't have

15
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,200
the anger of not accepting
the orders of their bosses

16
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,200
it preceded it a great unfolding
of military apparatuses

17
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:41,720
later a soldier came
accompanied by another

18
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:07,960
they spoke what they supposed it was French
I didn't understand neither a single word

19
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,200
without embargo,les I showed the free rooms
they seemed happy.

20
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,280
The following morning
a military car entered in the garden

21
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,400
Two soldiers lowered two boxes.

22
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,600
Hours later, I listened noises of horses
three horsemen appeared

23
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:05,200
they armed with my carpenter bank
and a hole that they made in the wall

24
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:09,200
a system with a rope to tie
to the horses before my shop

25
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,400
during two days I didn't see anybody

26
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:21,200
the horsemen left early,
they returned at night.

27
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,400
They slept on the straw of the loft.

28
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,200
In the morning of the third day it returned the car

29
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,400
A couple of sheets, please

30
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,000
My niece had just given me
a coffee as every night

31
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,400
The coffee makes me sleep. It was seated
in the bottom of the piece, in the dimness

32
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,400
Please!

33
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,760
My name is Werner von Ebrennach.
I sit down it a lot, but...

34
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:55,400
Naturally, it was necessary.
If it had been possible, it had avoided it

35
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,480
My ordinance will look after your tranquility.

36
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,600
Me...

37
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:32,320
I have great esteem
for people that loves to their homeland.

38
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:04,320
It would ascend to my piece,
but I don't know the road

39
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:09,640
My niece opened the door
that she/he gives on the stairway and it ascended

40
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,800
without looking at the official,
as if is alone

41
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:19,400
The official followed it,
I saw that she/he had a rigid leg

42
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,800
My niece returned.

43
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,400
For luck it seems to be correct.

44
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,400
The following day
the official lowered when we had breakfast

45
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,600
Not you if German had listened to us
or if for chance she/he had come somewhere around

46
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:48,000
She/he said,

47
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:52,280
I spent a very good night,
I wait that you also

48
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,800
The Mayor wanted to lodge in the castle

49
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,600
my men made a mistake
and I will congratulate them

50
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,800
this it is a lot a castle but beautiful

51
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,000
It returned at night
at the same hour that the eve

52
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,000
We took coffee, it hit,
but she/he didn't hope we opened up.

53
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,000
He opened up same.

54
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:08,720
I fear to bother them...
if they prefer it, I will go by the kitchen

55
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:21,600
they will close this door with key.

56
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,200
I wish them good night

57
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,400
We never close the door with key

58
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,800
I believe that the reason was not very clear neither very pure

59
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:50,400
my niece and I decide
to not change any detail of our life

60
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,400
as if the official didn't exist
as if it was a ghost

61
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,200
Maybe another feeling
she/he mixed with that will

62
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:07,000
I can not offend somebody without suffering
neither to my own enemy

63
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,800
During more than one month the same scene
she/he repeated day after day

64
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:18,000
It hit, she/he entered, she/he spoke
of the time, the temperature

65
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,400
or of topics without importance,
of those that she/he didn't wait answer

66
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,800
She/he stayed a while,
she/he looked around to its

67
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,600
and a smile translated
the pleasure that caused him that exam

68
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,800
the same one every day,
and the same pleasure

69
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:44,400
Their eyes were nailed
in my niece's profile

70
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,400
severe and insensitive siempe
and when it returned their view,

71
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,600
she/he guessed in him a smiling approval

72
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,000
I wish them good night.

73
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,600
The things changed abruptly one night

74
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,600
A very fine snow snowed,
terribly glacial

75
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:36,240
I put in the chimney a very big log
that it conserved this way for days

76
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:40,240
I imagined the official out
and she/he hoped to see it enter full with snow

77
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,000
but she/he didn't come.

78
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,200
The hour of its arrival passed,
and I recognized that he occupied my thought

79
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,800
My niece knitted slowly
it seemed very applied

80
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,800
we hear steps inside the house

81
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,600
I recognized for the unequal sound
walking of the official

82
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I realized that she/he had entered
for the other door that she/he came from their room.

83
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:13,200
Without a doubt, she/he had not wanted to be shown
with their wet uniform and without prestige

84
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:18,280
First it was changed clothes.
We hear it lower for the stairway

85
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,800
The door opened up and the official
dress appeared of civil

86
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,000
Forgive me, I don't have heating it was
very mojado,y my room is very cold

87
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,000
I will warm some minutes
with your fire 

88
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
Well. Well.

89
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,680
Here it is not anything,
the winter in France it is tempered

90
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,400
in my country it is very hard,
there are pines, there are thick forests

91
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,080
they fill with snow.
Here the trees are fine, 

92
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,200
the snow forms a fitting in them

93
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:15,920
there it is thought of a very strong bull,
that she/he needs their force to live.

94
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,600
Here it is the spirit,
the subtle and poetic thought.

95
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,600
I always loved France, always.
In the other war, era a boy. It doesn't count.

96
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:45,160
I always wanted it.
Alone that from a distance, like to a distant princess

97
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,600
for my father...

98
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,800
for my father.

99
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,000
She/he was a great patriot,
the defeat caused him a great pain.

100
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,600
and however, she/he loved France and Briand

101
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:22,560
She/he believed in the Republic of Weimar and in Briand

102
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:29,200
It was very enthusiastic
She/he said: "It will unite us as husband and woman"

103
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:38,400
she/he thought that the sun will come out in Europe
but Briand was conquered

104
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,400
and my father vi?that France continued directed
for cruel bourgeois

105
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:49,600
men like Of Vendel, Henri Bordeaux,
and for your old marshal.

106
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,600
She/he told me: "Don't return to France,
until being able to go with boots and helmet."

107
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:02,400
I should be promised it since it was moribund.

108
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:07,200
When exploding the war all Europe she/he knew
except France

109
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,200
I am a musician, that is to say, composer.
There all my life is

110
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,360
I find strange to see I eat up warrior
and however, this war doesn't weigh me.

111
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,240
I believe that of all this big things will come out.

112
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:46,600
Forgive me if I offended them,
but what I say, thinks it

113
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:53,600
with the best intentions
I have a lot of love for France

114
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:57,760
big things will come out for Germany and France stops

115
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,160
I think as she/he made it my father,
that the sun will shine in Europe

116
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,600
I wish them good night.

117
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:38,920
Maybe be inhuman to not direct him the word.

118
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,800
From that day their visits were this way.

119
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,000
Very rarely she/he went uniformed.

120
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,400
It was to avoid us to do it with the uniform

121
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:02,280
or so that we forgot it and us
did we go accustoming their person?

122
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:04,000
Maybe for both reasons.

123
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:07,200
She/he called and she/he entered without waiting answer

124
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:11,200
she/he knew that she/he would not have it,
she/he made it candidly

125
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:16,760
She/he came to warm,
that was their constant pretext

126
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,400
that she/he didn't deceive him to him, neither to my

127
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,000
and whose conventional character didn't hide

128
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:28,280
She/he didn't come every night but not
I remember none that doesn't speak to us

129
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:30,800
she/he leaned toward the fire

130
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:36,000
and while a part was granted
of the heat of the flame for if same

131
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:40,400
their voice cantarin rose sweetly,
during those veiled ones

132
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,800
speaking of the topics
that their heart harbored

133
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:49,200
the music, France.
It was an endless monologue.

134
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:54,000
She/he never tried to wait an answer,
an approval, a look.

135
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,000
She/he didn't speak a lot of time,
not more than the first night

136
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,400
Some cut sentences
for the silence, they were chained

137
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:12,400
with supreme monotony,
sometimes immobile, against the chimney,

138
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,000
as a caryatid,
and other, coming closer to an object,

139
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,600
to a drawing, then she/he was quiet
and she/he leaned.

140
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,000
I wish them good night.

141
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:33,600
She/he said in one of their first visits

142
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:39,200
Which the difference is among
this fire and that of my country?

143
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:42,520
The wood, the flame, clear,
the chimneys look like each other

144
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,600
but the light not, this depends
of the objects that it illuminates

145
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,000
of the inhabitants.

146
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,600
Does reason love so much this piece?

147
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:05,920
It is not so beautiful, forgive...
I mean that it is not...

148
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,800
a museum, nobody would say
that it is a marvel

149
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:16,400
but here there is a soul,
the whole house has a soul

150
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:23,400
Balzac, Baudelaire,
Corneille, Discard, Hugo

151
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,400
how many geniuses,
and only arrive to the H!

152
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,760
Neither Moliére, neither Racine,
neither Rabelais, neither Pascal, neither Stendhal,

153
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,080
Voltaire or Montaigne,
or all the other ones

154
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,960
The Englishmen think alone in Shakespeare

155
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,280
the Italians in Dante,
the Spaniards in Cervantes

156
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,760
and us in Goethe,
then it is necessary to look for.

157
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:53,920
But if one speaks of France,
at once Moliere arises

158
00:23:56,440 --> 00:24:00,800
Racine, Hugo, Voltaire,
Rabelais, or which another?

159
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,240
They are a crowd,
it is not tasted like the one who to mention first

160
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,800
But in music we are us.
Bach, Haendel

161
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,600
Beethoven, Wagner, Mozart,
which is the first one?

162
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,000
No, we were not born for the war.

163
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,200
It will be the last one, not
we will fight more. We will marry.

164
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,600
If, if.

165
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,400
It will be the most beautiful marriage in the world.

166
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,400
I wish them good night.

167
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,400
I will warm, it follows your.

168
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:44,400
She/he never made allusion to that encounter

169
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:53,200
When we enter to Sainte I was happy.
They received us well.

170
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,600
It was very happy,
I thought: "This will be easy."

171
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:02,160
But then I saw that it was not this way,
it was pure cowardice

172
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:07,920
and I feared for France,
I thought: " Has she/he become this way?"

173
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,800
No, not. I saw it at once.

174
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,800
And now I love to see their severe face.

175
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,400
I love to have found here

176
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,800
a worthy man
and a silent young lady

177
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,720
It will be necessary to conquer that silence

178
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,720
That silence of France.
I like that

179
00:27:57,920 --> 00:27:59,600
And one night

180
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:03,600
If, it is better this way.
Better.

181
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:08,080
That makes solid unions,
in those that each one wins in greatness

182
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:15,200
I read a beautiful story for children

183
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:18,400
You will also have made it

184
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:22,000
I don't know if the title
it is the same one in both countries

185
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,440
In my country it is
"You give Tier und you give Schöne"

186
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:28,440
"The beast and the beautiful one"
Poor beautiful!

187
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,720
The beast has it to her grace,
impotent and prisoner

188
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:38,120
it imposes him at all times
their implacable presence

189
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:44,000
the beautiful one is proud,
worthy, she/he has become hard

190
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,200
the beast is worth more than what seems

191
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,440
If, it is something ordinary,
clumsy, brutal, silly

192
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,600
beside the beautiful one,
so fine, but she/he has heart

193
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:03,680
a soul that aspires to rise,
if the beautiful one wanted.

194
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:11,600
The beautiful one took a lot in wanting

195
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:15,960
and she/he discovered in the eyes
of the hated jailer a light

196
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,800
a reflection in the one that
it was read the prayer and the love

197
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,520
then it felt less
the chains of their prison

198
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,920
She/he stops to hate. Their perseverance
it moves it and it spreads the hand

199
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:34,960
the beast transforms,
she/he becomes a gentleman

200
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,960
very beautiful and very pure,
delicate and well educated

201
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,040
to the one that each kiss of the beautiful one
she/he adorns of qualities

202
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:54,400
their union determines a sublime happiness

203
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,600
their children that add
and the gifts of their parents mix

204
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:02,400
they are the most beautiful in the world

205
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,360
Don't they like that story?
I always liked it to my

206
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:19,640
She/he reread it unceasingly,
she/he made me cry

207
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:25,480
She/he loved the beast mainly,
she/he understood their pain

208
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,800
today it still moves me to speak of her

209
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,800
I wish them good night.

210
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,800
One night I ascended to my room
to look for tobacco

211
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,000
and I listened the song of the harmonium

212
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:05,160
They were the preludes and flights that my
niece studied before the defeat

213
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:10,360
The notebook had been open,
my niece had not played more

214
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:16,400
To hear it caused in my pleasure and surprise

215
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:56,640
What interior necessity
had it impelled it?

216
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:20,000
But not, she/he had not abandoned
neither their armchair, neither their task.

217
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:07,920
There is not nothing else big that this,
and big it is not the word.

218
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,800
Outside of the man,
outside of their meat,

219
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,800
that makes us understand,
to guess?, no...

220
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:20,800
Better,
to foresee what is the nature

221
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:26,400
the divine nature,
of the human soul,

222
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,400
If, it is an inhuman music

223
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:36,800
Bach, it could only be German.

224
00:34:39,880 --> 00:41:22,680
Our earth
she/he has that character of inhuman

225
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,000
pale,
to the man's measure

226
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:54,760
I love this music,
I admit it

227
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:58,760
it is in my as,
the presence of God...

228
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:05,640
But it is not mine,
I want to make music to the man's measure

229
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,400
That is also a road
to reach the truth

230
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,400
It is my road,
it could not follow another

231
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,400
Now I know it,
sure, I know it.

232
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:24,000
From when?
Since I live here.

233
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:38,200
Now I need France,
but I request a lot,

234
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,440
I ask him to receive me.
I won't live in her as a stranger

235
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:46,800
a traveler or a conqueror.

236
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:51,200
In that case, she/he doesn't give anything,
anything can not be removed

237
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:55,600
their wealth, their great wealth
you can not conquer

238
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,400
it is necessary to drink it in their breast

239
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:03,200
she/he should offer it
with a maternal movement

240
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:07,680
I know that it depends on us,
but also of her

241
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:13,600
she/he should accept to understand
our thirst, satiating her

242
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,800
it should accept
to unite with us

243
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,200
I will have to live a lot of time
here, in a house like this

244
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:33,200
as the son of a town,
resemblance to this

245
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:36,000
it will be necessary...

246
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:45,960
I will conquer the obstacles,
for that it serves the sincerity

247
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:00,000
I wish them good night

248
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:08,560
I can not remember all that she/he said 

249
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:12,000
during a hundred o'clock veiled of winter

250
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:14,680
but the topics didn't vary a lot

251
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:18,800
their rhapsody of the discovery of France,
the distant love

252
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:22,040
that it felt for her before knowing it
and the love that grew

253
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,400
to newspaper since she/he lived in her

254
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:42,160
The truth, admired him,
she/he didn't loose heart and never

255
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,280
she/he tried to shake that implacable silence.

256
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,560
with violence in the language.
On the contrary, 

257
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:54,240
when the silence
it invaded the room

258
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,240
and it saturated him
as a heavy and unbreathable gas

259
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:03,600
it was the one that more comfortable
she/he felt of the three

260
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:07,840
my niece looked with approval,
smiling and serious

261
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:13,600
that it had been his,
from the first day.

262
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:18,000
I felt my niece's soul
to become agitated in the prison

263
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:20,000
that herself was built

264
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:24,800
she/he noticed it in certain signs,
in a slight tremor of their fingers

265
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:33,200
and when Werner
it dissipated that silence

266
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,600
smoothly,
for the filter of their voice zumbona, 

267
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:43,200
we seemed to be able to breathe
plus freely

268
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:46,560
The house where nací|estaba in the forest

269
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:52,000
I went to the school of the town,
I didn't leave it until going to Munich

270
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:56,000
for the exams
and to Salzburgo for the music

271
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:00,000
from then on I lived there,
it hated the big cities

272
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:05,200
I met London, Vienna, Rome
and Warsaw and the big ones

273
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,000
German cities naturally.

274
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:12,640
I don't like them to live,
only Praga that has more soul.

275
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:20,200
And mainly Nuremberg,
it is the city that dilates the heart.

276
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,800
a German finds in her
their ghosts, 

277
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,000
the memory of the nobility
of the old Germany

278
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,400
I believe that the French
they should feel the same thing in Chartres

279
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,720
the presence of their ancestors,
the grace of the soul.

280
00:39:41,560 --> 00:39:44,400
the splendor of their faith and their kindness.

281
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,800
The destination led me to Chartres

282
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:36,000
Attention!
950 meters! 10 more!

283
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:41,400
Fire!

284
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,320
And it is true, so many things
moved in the soul of a German

285
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:55,840
even the best of those which
she/he wanted that cures him.

286
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:11,120
In the neighboring castle to house
there is a very beautiful and sweet youth

287
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:18,200
my father had liked it
that I married her

288
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:53,200
when she/he almost died we were boyfriends,
she/he allowed to stroll alone

289
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:48,400
One day, being in the forest...

290
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:27,920
I am so happy Werner!
How sacred it is this creation of God!

291
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,040
I am also happy.

292
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,400
Damned animal!
It chopped me!

293
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,480
Look! I caught it!

294
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:48,000
Now I will punish him.
I will pull up him a paw after another.

295
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:05,600
For luck, she/he had other festejantes...

296
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,000
I didn't have remorses.

297
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,800
But I was always afraid
to the German girls

298
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:22,800
They are this way our politicians,
for that reason never I united to them

299
00:43:23,160 --> 00:43:27,200
to weigh that my friends told me:
Come with us!

300
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:31,800
But not,
I preferred to stay in my house

301
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:44,200
It was not very good for the Music,
but I didn't care it

302
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:49,160
the success is not anything,
a calm conscience is a lot

303
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:54,400
I believe that my friends
and our Führer has ideal noblemen

304
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:59,600
but they would pull up the paws
of the mosquitos some after others

305
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:04,800
that passes the Germans
when they are alone

306
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,800
that always revives and she/he has
more alone than those of the same one

307
00:44:09,720 --> 00:44:12,800
party when they are the masters

308
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:16,800
but they are no longer alone,
they are in France,

309
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:21,520
this will cure them. They know it,
they know that France will teach them

310
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:27,600
to truly be
big and pure

311
00:44:35,400 --> 00:44:39,400
for that she/he makes love,
shared love.

312
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,880
I wish them good night

313
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:46,400
They arrived the spring days

314
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,200
the official returned to the decline

315
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,520
Decisions will be made
historical of an unique reach

316
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:40,400
One night it lowered with a book

317
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,920
Their face was illuminated
with that smile that foresees

318
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,000
the neighbor's pleasure. She/he said:

319
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:55,160
Forgive that it bothers them,
but I lowered this for you

320
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:00,840
It is a page of Macbeth
What greatness!

321
00:46:05,440 --> 00:46:09,440
It is the end, the might of Macbeth
she/he is escaped from the fingers.

322
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:14,360
with the fidelity of those that measure
finally their black ambition.

323
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:19,840
The gentlemen that defend
the honor of Scotland

324
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:23,840
they wait their fall, one of them
it points out the symptoms of the hecatomb.

325
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,600
it feels that their secret crimes
they are hit to their hands

326
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,200
The heart men, indignant,
they reproach him their bad faith.

327
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,800
Those that sends,
they obey for fear, and not for love

328
00:46:46,600 --> 00:47:30,600
And you see their title
hanging around to its

329
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,440
as the suit of a giant
on the hands that she/he stole

330
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:03,360
It is not what perturbs
the nights of your present

331
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:08,400
I pity that man
although I reject him

332
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:11,480
as you they make it
and those that obey

333
00:47:11,480 --> 00:47:13,600
"they make it for fear and not for love"

334
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:22,000
A boss that is not loved,
she/he is a miserable puppet

335
00:47:22,920 --> 00:47:24,800
but could another thing be wanted?

336
00:47:26,960 --> 00:47:27,360
Alone a dark one ambitious
it would have accepted that

337
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:34,800
it was I specify somebody,
that she/he accepted to sell to their homeland

338
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:39,640
because today, neither in a lot
time France, it can not fall

339
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,000
in our open arms,
without losing the dignity

340
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,720
sometimes, the most sordid celestina

341
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:51,600
it is the base of a happy wedding

342
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:54,400
the celestina
it is not for anything worthless

343
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:56,400
neither the less happy union.

344
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,200
The train of Paris.

345
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,440
I should warn to my hosts
that I will leave two weeks

346
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,600
I am glad to go to Paris,
I have permission and I will pass it there,

347
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:14,960
for the first time.
It is a great day for my.

348
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,000
The biggest,
awaiting other, 

349
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:22,000
that I want with all my soul,
and that it will be even bigger.

350
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,480
I will know how to wait for it.
Years... if it is necessary.

351
00:48:28,480 --> 00:48:32,000
My heart has a lot of patience

352
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:36,000
I suppose that in Paris,
I will see my friends.

353
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:39,400
Many business
with the political men of here

354
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:43,200
preparing the wonderful union
of both towns

355
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:45,840
This way, I will be witness of that wedding.

356
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,160
I am happy for France,
their wounds will heal this way quick.

357
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:59,520
But I am happy
even more for Germany and for my.

358
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:05,200
Nobody will take advantage of this good action
as much as she/he will make Germany

359
00:49:06,120 --> 00:49:10,400
returning to France
their greatness and freedom.

360
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,000
I wish them good night.

361
00:50:38,320 --> 00:50:42,000
THE FRENCH ARMY
EMBARKED IN BOULOGNE

362
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:44,800
ENGLAND THREATENS.
A THIRD Coalition

363
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:48,400
It is ALREADY IN THE CONTINENT.
THE FRENCH

364
00:50:48,400 --> 00:50:52,000
They FLY FROM THE OCEAN TO THE DANUBE.
BAVIERA is LIBERATED

365
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:03,800
GOD AND THE KING Send ME
To EXPEL THEM OF ALL FRANCE

366
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:35,720
When it returned we didn't see it.
We didn't know reason.

367
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:40,120
The presence of a guest
it is revealed by diverse signs

368
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,200
Although it is invisible.
During many days, more than one week

369
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:51,960
We didn't see it. I admit that that
absence didn't leave alone me

370
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:59,480
She/he thought of him, and non sé|si it felt to weigh or restlessness for it.

371
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:06,320
My niece and me,
we didn't make any comment

372
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,800
When we sometimes heard up
the unequal steps

373
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,880
to weigh that she/he guessed in her
for their attitude and their face

374
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,800
with the obstinate expression
and it attempts that their thought

375
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:25,600
she/he didn't walk far from mine.

376
00:52:33,600 --> 00:52:37,600
One day I had to go to the Command
for a declaration of rubbers.

377
00:52:58,880 --> 00:52:59,680
Happen.

378
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:15,600
BY A FREE EUROPE.

379
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:48,400
What does she/he want?
If, Boss.

380
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:53,280
Make 5 copies and send a...
and one send to each unit

381
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:55,680
Of agreement, my Lieutenant

382
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:34,160
I didn't count anything to my niece,
but the woman has intuition

383
00:54:36,720 --> 00:54:41,120
Along the veiled one,
she/he didn't stop to lift the eyes 

384
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,960
to look at myself to every minute
trying to read something

385
00:54:44,960 --> 00:54:50,000
in my face that I made an effort
to maintain it impassive.

386
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:52,400
smoking my pipe.

387
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:08,480
Finally,
she/he allowed to fall their hands like tired

388
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,600
and folding the fabric
she/he requested me permission to go to bed

389
00:55:42,520 --> 00:55:46,520
She/he kissed me, I believed to read in their
beautiful gray eyes a reproach

390
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,400
and a deep sadness.
After their departure, 

391
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,600
I felt an absurd rage.

392
00:55:57,120 --> 00:56:01,120
The rage of being absurd
and to have an absurd niece

393
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:05,600
What was all this idiocy?
She/he was not able to mantenemerlo.

394
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:10,520
If it was an idiocy,
she/he seemed to have deep roots

395
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:08,480
They were later 3 days,
hardly emptied our cups

396
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:13,160
we hear without place to doubts
that they approached the family steps

397
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:22,040
I remembered that first night
of winter where those steps

398
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:26,040
6 months they were heard behind.
I thought Today it rains."

399
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,760
My niece had a silk shawl
on the shoulders

400
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:36,920
and I warmed the fingers
in the hornillo of my pipe

401
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:38,920
although we were in summer.

402
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:43,640
I looked like each other to see
to the man behind the door

403
00:57:45,040 --> 00:57:48,080
preparation to hit,
retarding the moment

404
00:57:48,080 --> 00:57:52,080
in that for their expression of hitting,
it would commit the future

405
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,800
Finally, it hit.

406
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:03,200
I don't say with hesitation neither with
the abruptness of the conquered shyness

407
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:08,000
they were 3 sure and slow blows.

408
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:11,600
Dice with that calm
of somebody resolved to everything

409
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:16,800
I hoped the door opened up,
but she/he didn't open up

410
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:22,800
An indescribable agitation invaded me.

411
00:58:31,960 --> 00:58:33,600
She/he will leave. 

412
00:58:38,360 --> 00:58:42,360
Which they were that night,
the commandments of the dignity?

413
00:58:50,080 --> 00:58:52,080
Among, Mr.

414
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,880
That day I knew that a hand
she/he can for a correct observer 

415
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,920
to reflect the emotions
the same as the face

416
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:14,920
until better than him,
since it escapes better to the control.

417
00:59:40,400 --> 00:59:42,400
I should tell them something serious

418
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,000
What I said these 6 months,
all that the walls heard,

419
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:37,080
it is necessary to forget it.

420
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,920
How much light!

421
01:01:07,720 --> 01:01:11,720
I saw those victorious men.
I spoke to them. They laughed at my.

422
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:05,560
It was so happy
of having gone to Paris!

423
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:15,400
Treblinka? Perfect. And what?

424
01:02:16,360 --> 01:02:16,000
What does Treblinka mean?
Anything. Already anything.

425
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,360
How anything?
No. She/he leaves that.

426
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:27,360
That is not for the weak characters.

427
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:42,720
They execute mass
in cameras of gas

428
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:45,960
built for such an end,
with suffocating gases

429
01:02:45,960 --> 01:02:48,880
and crematory ovens.
The yield today in day

430
01:02:48,880 --> 01:02:53,200
it belongs to 500 people.
But the methods are perfected.

431
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:58,560
And in 2 months they will be been able to liquidate
2000 people per day.

432
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:15,000
It begins the spring.
Begin the spring!

433
01:03:18,120 --> 01:02:44,400
These cameras of gas
do they work at the present time?

434
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:31,760
No. Treblinka no longer uses it.
She/he ended. To retirement.

435
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,000
There is no longer the one who to execute.

436
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:23,160
I am surprised their point of view.

437
01:07:23,160 --> 01:07:27,200
She/he doesn't realize
that we deceive them?

438
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:32,480
She/he believes that we are as silly as
to let that France rises?

439
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:36,800
We are not musicians. The politics
it is not any idolatry.

440
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,520
For what reason did we make this war?

441
01:07:39,520 --> 01:07:41,240
To please the marshal?

442
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:45,200
We are not crazy,
neither we are imbecile.

443
01:07:45,200 --> 01:07:50,400
We can destroy France
and we will make it.

444
01:07:50,400 --> 01:07:54,400
We will destroy their force and their soul

445
01:07:54,400 --> 01:07:59,000
there the great danger is.
That is our task,

446
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:03,880
don't make you illusions.
We will keep the smile

447
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:07,280
we will be soft,
but we will make that France

448
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:09,840
be an obedient dog.

449
01:08:09,840 --> 01:08:12,800
You are influenced
for your love to France

450
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:17,240
It is dangerous. We don't go
to cure Europe of that pest.

451
01:08:17,240 --> 01:08:21,000
We will expel the poison.
We will praise their writers

452
01:08:21,000 --> 01:08:24,000
We already take cautions.

453
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:29,200
Any French book
she/he will enter in Belgium and Holland

454
01:08:29,200 --> 01:08:32,400
neither in any busy country,
except for publications

455
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:36,000
on ballistics
or cement production.

456
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,000
You work cultural, none.

457
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,440
We will pull up to the beast,
their poisonous teeth

458
01:08:41,440 --> 01:08:45,560
they begin to be afraid,
they tremble for their money

459
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:47,600
for their stomach,
for their industry and their trade

460
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:49,320
that is their only restlessness.

461
01:08:49,320 --> 01:08:54,280
Clear, there are exceptions, but to those
we will tranquilize them flattering them.

462
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:57,280
Anything is simpler.

463
01:08:57,280 --> 01:08:59,680
for a plate of lentils 

464
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:05,080
do they know what they are making?
Do they measure the reach?

465
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:10,360
Do you believe that we will doubt?
We are of another species.

466
01:09:10,360 --> 01:09:14,200
but the shipwreck of France,
it will be eternal.

467
01:09:14,200 --> 01:09:17,200
It is a matter of life or death.

468
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:21,360
To conquer coarse the force,
but it is not enough.

469
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:25,440
We know that the army
it doesn't reach to reign.

470
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:29,040
But not to expense of the spirit,
not to that price!

471
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:33,040
The spirit already other vi?
the spirit is immortal.

472
01:09:34,760 --> 01:09:38,040
We will create a Reich for a thousand years

473
01:09:38,040 --> 01:09:42,040
and the first thing is to destroy,
it is our right and our duty.

474
01:11:34,400 --> 01:09:36,000
Wait here.

475
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:48,800
A box of matches,
please, Sra,

476
01:12:05,240 --> 01:12:09,200
There are not hopes.
There are not hopes.

477
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,200
Anything. Anything.
Nobody.

478
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:28,160
Not alone the modern ones,
the Peguy, the Proust, the Bergson.

479
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:34,640
The other ones. All the other ones.
All.

480
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:44,280
They will turn off the flame of everything. 

481
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,400
Europe won't be illuminated by that light.

482
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:03,920
One of them was my friend.
She/he was my brother.

483
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:09,960
We study together.
We lived in the same room in Stuttgart

484
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:16,000
3 months we pass together in Nuremberg.

485
01:13:17,640 --> 01:13:21,640
She/he played him my music,
she/he read me their poems.

486
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,480
It was sensitive and romantic.
But she/he abandoned me.

487
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:34,400
And she/he left to read their poems to Munich.

488
01:13:36,320 --> 01:13:40,320
Before other partners. She/he wrote
requesting me that it was with him.

489
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,000
I did it in Paris with their friends.

490
01:13:48,440 --> 01:13:50,440
I saw that they made with him.

491
01:13:52,920 --> 01:13:56,920
It was rabid.
It mixed the rage with the laugh.

492
01:13:58,760 --> 01:14:02,720
I looked at myself inflamed and she/he screamed:

493
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:06,880
It is necessary to empty
the poison of the beast!

494
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,880
I said:
Do they realize that they make?

495
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:16,600
She/he looked at it in the deep thing
of their clear eyes.

496
01:14:17,440 --> 01:14:21,440
It was I am honest.
That is the terrible thing.

497
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:26,520
They will make what they say.
With method and perseverance

498
01:14:28,640 --> 01:14:30,640
I know those beasts!

499
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:41,200
Their lips you entreabieron,
I believed that it would throw us

500
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:45,200
an exhortation for
to induce us to the rebellion.

501
01:14:46,360 --> 01:14:50,240
But it didn't pronounce neither
a single word on that.

502
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:56,880
They told me:
"It is our right and our duty"

503
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,760
Our duty...

504
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:04,840
Blissful the one that finds with so 
simple certainty the one on the way to their duty

505
01:15:10,120 --> 01:15:14,120
In the crossroad, they tell us:
take that road!

506
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:18,800
But that road doesn't go
toward the luminous heights

507
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:24,800
it lowers toward a sinister valley,

508
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:30,000
she/he collapses in the fetid ones
darkness of a forest.

509
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:40,840
God!
Show me where my duty is!

510
01:15:55,080 --> 01:15:58,400
Is the duty maybe to accept a crime?

511
01:16:14,840 --> 01:16:18,840
I made be worth my rights.
I asked to go to the front.

512
01:16:21,520 --> 01:16:25,520
That favor was granted me.
They authorized me to leave tomorrow.

513
01:16:28,840 --> 01:16:32,000
And I will return to the combat, as hell.

514
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:55,600
I wish them good night. Good-bye.

515
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,000
Good-bye.

516
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,000
I hardly heard that word, but I heard it.

517
01:17:18,760 --> 01:18:40,800
von Ebrennach also heard it.

518
01:19:01,280 --> 01:19:02,880
Lower my things.

519
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:54,200
ALIVE THE SOLDIER THAT
DISOBEY A CRIMINAL ORDER!

520
01:20:15,960 --> 01:20:17,200
All clever one is.

521
01:20:25,240 --> 01:20:26,400
Well. I already go.

522
01:21:16,120 --> 01:21:20,000
My niece me preparó|el eats lunch as always

523
01:21:20,480 --> 01:21:24,480
it served me in silence,
we drank in silence.

524
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:40,840
A pale sun shone
through the fog

525
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:46,400
I found that it was very cold.

526
01:21:55,920 --> 01:22:02,240
October 1941

527
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:05,040
This book, published thanks to a patriot

528
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,600
she/he finished printing under the Nazi occupation

529
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:10,600
February 20 1942.

530
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:17,200
Subtitulos Oski!
