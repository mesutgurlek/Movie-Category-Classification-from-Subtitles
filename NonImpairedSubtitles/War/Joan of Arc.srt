JOAN OF ARC
(subtitle by alanchiawc at www.subscene.com)

2
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,114
And so by disposition of the divine mercy,

3
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,669
it was done most opportunely,

4
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,992
that Joan, child of god,

5
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,711
daughter of France, today be placed among the

6
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,911
number of the saints.

7
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:18,555
Saint Joan of Arc
whose history is recorded here,

8
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:21,877
lived only 19 years on this earth.

9
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,792
She was born in 1412
in a village of Domremy,

10
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,316
on the marche of Lorraine.

11
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:33,830
At the time when France,
losing the hundred years war,

12
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,279
was overrun by her enemies,
her cities ruined, her farms stripped bare,

13
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,629
her people hopeless.

14
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:45,316
But the enemies of France did not reckon
on the girl Joan

15
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:50,350
praying in the little ruined
church of her village.

16
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:54,912
As she knelt there, the voices
of the saint spoke to her again and again,

17
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:59,193
urging her to become a soldier,
to lead the armies of France

18
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:01,112
to victory.

19
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:02,993
But how?

20
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,913
How can I?

21
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,594
Save France?
How can I?

22
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,229
Lead the Dauphin to his coronation?

23
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,476
I'm only a poor girl of the farms.
I've never seen a king or an army.

24
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,913
How?

25
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,709
I'm not fitted to speak to
great people or among them.

26
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,717
All this time I have... I have

27
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,794
tried to make a beginning
but I can find no ways

28
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,678
so nothing is done.

29
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,018
I know that everyday now
we lose France. But I

30
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:37,636
still don't how to go about
what is asked of me.

31
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:42,319
So I do nothing.
Forgive me, forgive me.

32
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,958
I am helpless and anguish.

33
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,031
Will a voice come and say that
I am forgiven.

34
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,873
I've tried with all my soul, I've tried.

35
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,876
Then I must go

36
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:21,670
and do what I can without knowing how.

37
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,873
Uncle Durand!

38
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,713
Uncle Durand!

39
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,159
Uncle Durand!

40
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,398
- Jeannette, did I forget something?
- No, only uncle Durand

41
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,710
I must go to Vaucouleurs, take me with you.

42
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,472
- To Vacouleurs?
- Yes.

43
00:06:56,560 --> 00:07:01,031
Your father said nothing about this to me.
Your mother said nothing about it.

44
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,509
No.

45
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,669
Well this is very strange, Jeannette.

46
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:09,235
You want to buy something in the city?

47
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,718
I have to speak to
Sir Robert de Baudricourt.

48
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:18,553
What about? Why would you
speak to the King's captain?

49
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:23,755
- I can't tell you Uncle Durand.
- Then I can't take you.

50
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,071
I shall walk then.

51
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,318
Even if I wear my legs
to the knees, I must go.

52
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,550
It maybe that I do wrong...
but come.

53
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,112
- Next.
- Gerard Morseau, Sir Robert.

54
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,517
- Morseau, you are late for the taxes.
- Uh they burn my house, Sir Robert.

55
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,190
- Stole my grain.
- Give him till next harvest.

56
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,154
Durand Laxart,

57
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,790
- Taxes in your village is not due yet.
- I know, Sir Robert.

58
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,952
- This is uh... this is my niece.
- Hm.

59
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,640
She is the daughter of
Jacques D'Arcde of Domrémy.

60
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:31,592
Yes, yes.

61
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:34,190
She wish to speak with you.

62
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,518
- I... I...
- Yes, yes, go on, go speak up. Tell me.

63
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,228
I... I bring
you a message Sir Robert.

64
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:52,513
You must send me to the Dauphin.
My lord commands it.

65
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,308
Your lord? I am your lord!

66
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,917
- My Lord is the King of Heaven.
- Hm, that's a point. That's a point.

67
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,469
But I am to lead the Dauphin's armies.

68
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,598
To lead his armies?
When did the Dauphin have an army?

69
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,796
And women don't lead
armies girl, they follow!

70
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:15,838
And if you want to become them,
the camp follower can be arranged.

71
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,792
- But I'm to save France.
- To save France?

72
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,598
Go home girl and don't be an idiot!

73
00:09:24,836 --> 00:09:28,076
If it would have been possible to save France,
it would have been done long ago.

74
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:30,357
But you must send me to the Dauphin,
I must save France!

75
00:09:30,358 --> 00:09:32,918
I am sorry, Sir Robert.
I didn't know what she is going to say.

76
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,599
I'll take her home.

77
00:09:37,974 --> 00:09:40,974
What a fool you made out of me, if
I've known what you are going to say...

78
00:09:40,975 --> 00:09:44,055
I didn't want to bring this on you uncle
Durand, but there was no other way.

79
00:09:44,056 --> 00:09:45,096
And I had to speak to him.

80
00:09:45,097 --> 00:09:46,977
You had to? Your father
will never forgive me.

81
00:09:47,225 --> 00:09:48,945
- Never in the world!
- Hush, hush cousin.

82
00:09:48,946 --> 00:09:49,793
Make way!

83
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,036
Attention! Make way!

84
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,993
Jeannette! No, Jeannette, come back!

85
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,792
- Sir Robert has spoken!
- Sir Robert!

86
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:03,628
Sir Robert, you must send me
out to take part in the war!

87
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:07,196
Orleans is in great danger,
and even today a battle is raging.

88
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,798
What? Orleans is 200 leagues from here,
nobody knows what's going on there.

89
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:15,234
Sir Robert!

90
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,188
Sir Robert!

91
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,919
Jeannette!

92
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:25,356
That's a very strange thing you said girl.

93
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,718
Yes, they are strange.

94
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,698
I'm sent here to speak to
Sir Robert, but you saw

95
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,996
that he cares neither for
me nor for my words.

96
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,920
Nevertheless before the middle of Lent
I must be with the Dauphin.

97
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,477
Believe me I rather go home
and spin with my mother.

98
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,512
For this is not my proper place.
But there is not one person in the world,

99
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:52,672
not among Kings, or nobles, or princes
who can bring help to the France we love.

100
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,037
Not once save this maid you see before you.

101
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,558
It's not because of anything in me, but
because the King of heaven wishes it so.

102
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,552
Have you heard of a prophecy?

103
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,436
There is a prophecy that
a maid from Lorraine will save France.

104
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:13,037
- Have you heard it?
- No, I know nothing of a prophecy.

105
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,913
Why are you here again?

106
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:27,795
You know Sir Robert won't see you.
Go home girl and don't come back tomorrow.

107
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,398
That's she, coming now.

108
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:43,158
- Forgive me, but are you the maid?
- I'm Joan, daughter of Jacques D'Arc.

109
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,937
We heard about you in
Lille, we wanted to see you.

110
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:48,434
And to tell you that we believe
in you, we prayed for you.

111
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,509
We held a mass for you last Sunday.

112
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:53,959
Thank you.

113
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,875
I know that your prayers will help.

114
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,715
The gates were locked in my face again.

115
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,313
Mother.

116
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,515
I came to take you home, Jeannette.

117
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,476
You must come home, Jeannette.

118
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,920
A dark dream has crept over you for a little
while, but its done no harm, and soon

119
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:27,592
it will be gone and when it's gone

120
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,592
no one will think of it.

121
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,598
But come home.

122
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,595
I never wanted to hurt you, mother.

123
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,153
For I love you more than
anyone else in the world.

124
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,396
But if I had a
100 fathers and a 100 mothers,

125
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,758
I could not go back.
I must go forward now.

126
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:48,509
Then tell me where, Jeannette?

127
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,871
Toward what would you go?

128
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,035
- Where's the girl?
- Sir Robert.

129
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,159
That's the one.

130
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,993
Exactly 2 weeks ago you came
to see me and spoke of a battle.

131
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,353
Today a courier came with messages.
There was indeed a great battle on that day.

132
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,591
And a heavy defeat for the Dauphin.

133
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:20,273
How did you learnt this?
Have you studied witchcraft?

134
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:25,432
- Oh surely you know I have not.
- That is just what we do not know.

135
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:28,109
Father Fournier, put her to question.

136
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,630
If you are a thing of evil
and sent from Satan, depart from us.

137
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,675
If you are good and from god, come near

138
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,076
I ask your blessing, father.

139
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,914
And I ask of whatever is evil
fly far from you.

140
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:06,636
Whatever is good remain to help
our cause in the course of France.

141
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,791
She is no socerer, Sir Robert.

142
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,679
Whatever you have heard or see,
whether prophecy or not,

143
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,191
the devil has no part in it.

144
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:23,596
Thank you, father.

145
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:29,634
- You still wish to go to the Dauphin.
- My Lord has commanded me to go.

146
00:14:29,955 --> 00:14:32,235
These 2 gentlemen wish me to
send you forth on this wild

147
00:14:32,236 --> 00:14:34,756
mission of yours, they are willing
to ride with you as escort.

148
00:14:34,925 --> 00:14:38,165
To me it seems like a fool's attempt,
but they believe you may help our country.

149
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,435
Now if there is a chance of that,
I don't want to put anything in the way.

150
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,835
Then it shall all come true.

151
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:50,671
Goodbye, my child.

152
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:02,594
Ever since I heard you speak,
I've got a kind of dream.

153
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:05,718
But I never yet seen it
clearly where I must go,

154
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,672
or what I must do with my life.

155
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,029
But suddenly, when I heard your voice,
it seem to me that I knew.

156
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,153
I come to be your follower.

157
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,950
Thank you.
You are the first.

158
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,519
And I'm quite willing to be the second.
When do we set out?

159
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,030
Today rather than tomorrow.
Tomorrow rather than the day after.

160
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,035
Joan, have you ridden before?

161
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,440
By the time we reach Chinon
I should ride well.

162
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,560
Take care that you ride only by night,

163
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,428
the news of your coming will run ahead like

164
00:15:40,429 --> 00:15:42,309
fire and the enemy will
want to watch for you.

165
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,073
I fear them not.

166
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,273
A mother bears children and gives them to the
world and she thinks she knows them well.

167
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,877
But she doesn't know them at all.

168
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,792
And now you must go. Guard her well.

169
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,077
With many leagues to ride
and icy rivers to cross.

170
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,590
Go to the shrine of redeemer,
mother, and pray for us.

171
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:23,349
- Goodbye!
- God be with you!

172
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:28,509
- Godspeed, Joan, come back soon!
- Goodbye, Joan!

173
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,756
- God help you Joan.
- Thank you!

174
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,879
Go then maid of Lorraine,
I expect but little of you,

175
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,355
but go...
and come what may.

176
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,598
Farewell, Joan!

177
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:44,960
- Goodbye!
- Farewell, Joan!

178
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,912
Well, tell us who you are!

179
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,950
Travelers, my friend, just travelers.

180
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,477
- And who may you be?
- I'm the head constable of Clairevaux.

181
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,193
We're honest men.

182
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,274
You may be, but I must look at you.

183
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,108
Are you a lad?

184
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:41,872
- Let me tell you why we meet you here.
- Well, tell us and let us go on.

185
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,993
There is a party of
Burgundy soldiers in our town.

186
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,317
They say that they're here
to lay hands on the maid from Lorraine,

187
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,755
the one that is coming to help the Dauphin.

188
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,670
If one of you should be that maid,

189
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:57,071
- Then go round our village.
- Thank you, constable.

190
00:17:57,320 --> 00:17:58,548
This does not concern us.

191
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,834
My wife send two loaves of bread.

192
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,797
- That was the best we could do.
- Thank you again.

193
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:09,554
I would like to if you would permit me to

194
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,720
lay them in the hands of the lad myself.

195
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,080
If it should be that you're
the maid from Lorraine,

196
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:17,961
I don't say that you are,
but if it should be,

197
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,313
I have a message for you from
the people of Clairevaux.

198
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,594
It's this:

199
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,150
"God go with you."

200
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:30,751
"God go with you and save
France and save us too."

201
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,669
Now we can go to our homes, neighbours,

202
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:45,715
we've seen her and we've
given her the warning.

203
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,118
Those are the towers of Chinon.

204
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,675
Oh we've come through safely.

205
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,032
We're here.

206
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,150
- Did you bring the gold Tremouille?
- Gold?

207
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,555
Gold? No, I did not.

208
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:18,635
You should bow when you come
into the presence, Duke.

209
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,230
Your attitude is... slovenly.

210
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,198
- You owe me money.
- Money?

211
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:27,200
I have definite information that
you plan to abandon your kingdom.

212
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,514
You're leaving us.

213
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,233
You're deserting us.

214
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,120
If I lent you 3,000 crowns,

215
00:19:33,438 --> 00:19:36,318
you dissapear to the North or the
South and I can whistle for my money.

216
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:39,717
Not only this loan in question but the
enormous sums you already owe me.

217
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,473
Then lend me a thousand.

218
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:45,714
It's safer, I can't go very far on that.

219
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,433
I'll need your signature.

220
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,831
I refuse to sign until I have the money.

221
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,110
I'll need your signature first.

222
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,278
- Lacky, a quill for my Lord.
- You robber! You thief! You brigand!

223
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,318
Gentlemen, not before the court.

224
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,720
Before he lends me money he demands my
signature at the bottom of a blank page,

225
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,308
and I know why.

226
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,480
Everytime I borrow from
him he uses my signature

227
00:20:06,481 --> 00:20:08,081
to sell some of my territory to Burgundy

228
00:20:08,082 --> 00:20:09,638
to raise the money he lends me.

229
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,951
A prophet has come from Lorraine.

230
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:15,516
Promising to save France
and crown our Dauphin.

231
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,356
The game is we put the
Count of Clermont on the throne,

232
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:23,472
he will pretend that he is
the illustrious Charles.

233
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,588
When the evening is over, I shall
be Dauphin by popular demand, huh?

234
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,112
Fortunately, that is not enough.

235
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,390
- Now, sit on the throne.
- Please,

236
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:46,710
a little obeisance, my good people.

237
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,119
That's better.

238
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:54,036
Now, let her enter.
Let her enter, I say.

239
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,919
Ah... there are three of you.

240
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,509
And which may I ask
is the maid of Lorraine?

241
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,512
- I am the maid from Lorraine.
- Who are these other maidens with you?

242
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:31,311
This is Jean de Metz and Bertrand de
Poulengy came with me to guard me.

243
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,631
A family of three?

244
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:37,430
Sir if you mean anything against the
maid or doubt our respect for her

245
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,591
I advice to watch what you say.

246
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,270
My apologies.

247
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,917
I'd rather nobody knelt to me.

248
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:51,480
Then nobody will. I assure you, it's not
a position one chooses for comfort.

249
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,676
But come, here's our great Dauphin.

250
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,351
Well, here I sit waiting for the crown
you promised me, maid of Lorraine.

251
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,188
See that I am crowned.

252
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,358
See that I am crowned at once.

253
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,274
Here,

254
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,795
your Dauphin offers you his hand, maiden.

255
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,989
My gentle Dauphin it is you I seek.

256
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:27,678
I've come a long way to find you
and no other can take your place.

257
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:30,952
God has spoken to me thru his messengers.

258
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,918
And it is his will that I come to aid
you and that you'll be King of France.

259
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,036
How did you know me?

260
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,396
I can tell you that when we are alone.

261
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,798
What is your opinion?

262
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:55,919
This girl is dangerous,
there must be a third party.

263
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:59,715
- I could swear she was sent by your enemies.
- My Dauphin, I say to you

264
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:02,510
from this hour the war will change.

265
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,436
And your life will change.

266
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,560
But the truth is, Joan, I'm
not the sort of person

267
00:25:08,561 --> 00:25:10,401
God would be very likely
to be interested in.

268
00:25:10,560 --> 00:25:11,879
Truely, I'm not.

269
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,273
Though I'm no worse than the
others here probably but...

270
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,994
God bothers very little with any
of us if you should ask me.

271
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:22,112
Now, I've been honest with you.
Be honest with me.

272
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,309
What is it you want?
Money?

273
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:26,709
Lands?

274
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,314
Presents?

275
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:31,257
I'm a poor man in spite of being...

276
00:25:31,258 --> 00:25:33,873
It is not true that God
takes no interest in you.

277
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:39,517
You say that to hide yourself from me
as you just now hid among the women.

278
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,837
But God will find you out.
And make you King.

279
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,555
This is an honest voice.
Listen to her, Charles.

280
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,838
I think you've come just in time.

281
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,148
For a moment... I thought
you were the Dauphin.

282
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:57,356
I'm his cousin, the Duke of Ronson.

283
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,676
I'm glad you're here, good Duke.

284
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,590
The more we gather of the
royal blood of France,

285
00:26:04,840 --> 00:26:08,116
- the stronger is our cause.
- Don't trust her my Lord.

286
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,437
I'm trying not to trust her.

287
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,957
But everytime I looked into her eyes,

288
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:19,158
- I believe what she says is true.
- More reason to distrust her.

289
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:26,318
Gentle Dauphin,

290
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:32,878
if I tell you things so secret that
they are known to you and God alone,

291
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,519
will you believe that I am sent by him?

292
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,599
Come with me, Joan.

293
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,559
Nicholas, unhinge from the plow!
Bring your horse!

294
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:15,512
Come and join the maid's army!

295
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,950
Maid?
She has no army!

296
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,549
- Then she will soon have one!
- Come along, Nicholas!

297
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,791
- Come along!
- Join us!

298
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:56,592
Men come flocking by the thousands.

299
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,513
The maid's name is magic.

300
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,109
- My people believe in that.
- Nobody holds back?

301
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,715
Why? Why? Why?
The army gathered.

302
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,319
Men are coming from everywhere.

303
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:09,320
Gold and jewels are dug from the
ground and poured into the treasury.

304
00:28:09,321 --> 00:28:11,759
Grain and cattle we couldn't
buy are sent as gifts.

305
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:14,908
You ordered us to raise
the army, we've done it.

306
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,280
- But you still haven't given us the word to march.
- But I couldn't very well

307
00:28:18,281 --> 00:28:21,641
before the girl had been examined by the
archbishop and the officers of the church.

308
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,597
But the examination has finished.

309
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:29,234
20 learned and loyal priests questioned
her over 3 weeks at Poitiers.

310
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:32,560
They sent to Domremy and Vaoucouieurs
for all the available evidence of allure.

311
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:36,040
The church finds Joan untouched,
religious and pure at heart,

312
00:28:36,041 --> 00:28:37,956
- and says so formally.
- Yes.

313
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:40,914
Although we find nothing except good in her,

314
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:44,271
still we are not certain if it's
wise to send her into battle.

315
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,640
At present you are at least alive, Dauphin,
but if you throw yourself

316
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,598
into this war you may lose not
only your kingdom, but your life.

317
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,719
I'm not going to lead the army.
She's going to lead it.

318
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,798
A green country girl
leading an army of France?

319
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,920
You will be the laughing
stock of Christiandom.

320
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:02,316
I've been there for a long time.
Thanks to you... and you.

321
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,800
For years you've tried to convince me that
I'm a pretender to my father's throne.

322
00:29:05,801 --> 00:29:09,918
A scoundrel, an imbecile.
At times I've been inclined to believe you.

323
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,392
But then she came...
and sort me out.

324
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,551
What did she tell you in the chapel?

325
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:18,959
I can't tell you that.

326
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,748
And I won't.

327
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,636
You'll tell us.
You've never kept a secret in your life.

328
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:26,753
I shall keep this one.

329
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,914
The truth is I don't yet
know what I want to do.

330
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:37,193
It's my own head, mind you.
My own head and my crown.

331
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,510
I don't know whether I want to risk them.

332
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,430
But how long are we to wait?
Are we never to relieve Orleans.

333
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,879
I don't know.

334
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,318
I don't know.

335
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,596
The longer you wait the wiser, your Majesty.

336
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,035
I'm not sure of that either.

337
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,829
- Your majesty, l...
- My Dauphin, forgive my bad manners.

338
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:06,120
For days I've tried to see you but the
guard said no, you were in council...

339
00:30:06,121 --> 00:30:08,361
My dear Joan, that cloak
becomes you, you look radiant!

340
00:30:08,362 --> 00:30:10,998
I thank you for it, my Dauphin,
all preparations are made.

341
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,589
Let us have action.
Men of action and not men of words!

342
00:30:14,040 --> 00:30:16,998
Send me to Orleans, the sign
you asked for will be given.

343
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:19,310
- Now is the time.
- There is always time, Joan.

344
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,829
No, there is not always time, my Dauphin.

345
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,834
Use me well, for I've told you
I shall last a year but a little longer.

346
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,997
Come ride with us to Orleans.

347
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:31,312
If you wish me to say yes, you must
not ask for unreasonable things.

348
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,715
You must not ask me to lead an army.

349
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:38,473
I warn you again, your Majesty.
It's not common sense to trust this girl.

350
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,509
If it be God's will to deliver Orleans,
Why do you need soldiers?

351
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,318
The soldiers will fight
and God will give them victory.

352
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:49,798
I cound be sure...
You see it's myself that I'm not sure of.

353
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,438
- I'm not sure I would make a good King.
- What you need is faith in God.

354
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,560
When you have that
you have faith in yourself.

355
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,189
I'm not sure God wants me to be King.

356
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:07,152
Why should God send me help, when I am...

357
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:10,272
what I am?

358
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,950
Put aside your doubts and fears, my Dauphin.

359
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:20,317
Be noble as I have dream you to be,
be as God requires you to be,

360
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,909
be as France needs you.

361
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:26,590
Your France, your nation and your people,

362
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:31,789
so helpless without you, but unconquerable
as soon as you turn your trust to God.

363
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,075
- Can you look at her face and doubt, my Lord?
- No.

364
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,271
I do not doubt now.

365
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,796
Alenson, take her to the captains.

366
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,791
God is with this girl,

367
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:51,474
and will be with her in battle.

368
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:06,157
Gentlemen, I present you Joan the maid.

369
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,551
This is Antel,

370
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,434
Couvert,

371
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,479
Poulon,

372
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,073
Derrogaux,

373
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,713
Serseraille,

374
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,991
and this is Laire.

375
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:35,240
Hah! By the wild bull of Bujon!
It's a girl... and in harness! Hahaha!

376
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,440
Laire takes pride in being a plain blood
fellow without polish for anybody,

377
00:33:39,441 --> 00:33:42,555
so think nothing of his greeting.
He fights well.

378
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,036
If he fights well, I shall like him.

379
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:51,719
If I'm a fool, God at least
does not held it against me.

380
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,800
Joan I promise you, that
so long as you don't try

381
00:33:54,801 --> 00:33:57,399
to give any commands, we
shall all get along well.

382
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,710
Oh, I shall not try to give any commands?
I wouldn't know what commands to give.

383
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,559
By the rock of Moses, that's the first
sensible word I heard you say, wench!

384
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,400
You stick to that and by the thunders
of God there will be no trouble.

385
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:09,348
Don't swear, Laire.

386
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:10,959
Don't swear?

387
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,259
Now, by the black rock of...

388
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,580
There must be no swearing in
this army among high or low.

389
00:34:15,581 --> 00:34:17,630
Do you want to strike the army dumb?

390
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:21,077
- This must begin with you.
- You said you would give no order, Joan.

391
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,709
Oh, but this is not a military order, sir.

392
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,797
Surely you must see that.

393
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:31,749
But the army that is to march on Orleans
was raised in a holy cause.

394
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,799
I saw the men today,

395
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,429
there were women among them,
they drank and swore.

396
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:40,798
These things must cease and every man
must go to confession before we march.

397
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:44,396
- Before God...
- Don't swear, Laire.

398
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,714
But if you must, swear by my staff.

399
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:50,798
By my staff?
What kind of an oath is that?

400
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,110
No army was ever sent to confession.

401
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:55,356
If we gave such orders, we'll be laughed at.

402
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,119
- I shall give no such command!
- Or any of us, you may be sure of that.

403
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:20,511
By the swords of Lazarus!

404
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:25,715
What war have it's leaders had to sit
in council with a green country girl?

405
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:27,918
A pat on that silly Dauphin of ours.

406
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:31,874
Bad enough when he was a plain coward.
Now he sends children to lead us.

407
00:35:32,120 --> 00:35:33,560
She's not to lead us, you great ark.

408
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,598
She's to ride before us as a
sort of symbol, a figurehead

409
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:39,798
for the soldiers to rally around.

410
00:35:39,799 --> 00:35:43,279
No by the love of Janice and all his 2 face
Janissaries, she will not rally me around.

411
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,120
I don't expect she be
of much help in battle,

412
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:47,799
- Nevertheless I'm grateful to her.
- For what?

413
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:50,152
For giving us another chance.

414
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,438
Do you play this game often?

415
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,358
Every day all day.

416
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,713
That takes it all.

417
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,878
From now on there won't be
much time for games.

418
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:13,549
- It's the maid.
- The maid.

419
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,594
- The maid... the one we follow.
- Is it something we can do perhaps?

420
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:21,319
Yes.
Pick up your dice for a moment.

421
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:23,158
Pick up your dice, my friend.

422
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:26,458
They tell me that armies are
like this, that all armies

423
00:36:26,459 --> 00:36:28,756
are like this and that
there is no changing them.

424
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,919
Yet we cannot have victory
we are not worthy of it.

425
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:34,156
But we came here because
you promised victory.

426
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:37,717
It is true that God has called us
to the work we are to do,

427
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,115
but it is not enough that God is on our side,

428
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,151
we must be on his side.

429
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,993
What are we to do, maid?

430
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,793
There must be no gambling.

431
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,912
- No gambling?
- No, not even in secret.

432
00:36:49,320 --> 00:36:52,118
And you must not swear
and take God's name in vain.

433
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,390
- What was that?
- No swearing the maid said.

434
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,597
And you must send away all your women.

435
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,353
- What? What's that?
- No women.

436
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,672
- There must be no camp followers.
- She means us.

437
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,275
And before we march each
man must go to confession

438
00:37:06,276 --> 00:37:08,630
and clear his soul of all evil he has done.

439
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,360
What does she thinks we are? Monks?

440
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,511
- Be quiet!
- Let her speak!

441
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:14,159
Please hear me.

442
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:15,959
As many as can.

443
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:20,709
You see, there is no strength in me.

444
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,835
And no strength in my hands.

445
00:37:24,560 --> 00:37:29,111
There is no strength in any of our hands
great enough to win against the English.

446
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,512
Our strength is in our faith.

447
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:37,399
And if our faith is eaten away by
little things that God hates then,

448
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:41,599
so there be a million of us,
we shall be beaten back and die.

449
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,753
Yes, come near!

450
00:37:45,080 --> 00:37:46,798
And you men too!

451
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,829
And those who cannot hear!
Give them this message!

452
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,275
We can win only if we become God's army.

453
00:37:57,440 --> 00:38:01,592
It is not easy to stand here before you,
and ask this of you.

454
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,030
Perhaps it will not be easy to do.

455
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,316
But I know that if these things are done

456
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:12,518
then though the English
hang from the clouds

457
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:15,518
and ride on the whirlwind,
we shall beat them.

458
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,717
Though their arrows
fall like hail from the sky

459
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,309
and their spears be a ring of steel

460
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:25,159
and their cannons speak and strike
like the thunderstorm from heaven,

461
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:27,595
yet they shall be ours!

462
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,240
For this, God has promised.

463
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,312
Our father who is in heaven is our leader.

464
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,795
He will be with us,
while we hallow his name.

465
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,636
He will give us all we need.

466
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,072
Our daily bread,

467
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,035
our victory and the land
that is forever free.

468
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,993
Why are we on this side of the
river if that is Orleans?

469
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,396
You've come this way for order of Dunois.

470
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:31,676
- Bastard of Orleans.
- He commands here?

471
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:35,634
Yes, girl. That must be he
riding out to welcome you.

472
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:54,271
- Greetings Dunois.
- Greetings, my Lord.

473
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,400
You're most heartedly welcomed, my friends.

474
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:58,671
More so since you bring the maid with you.

475
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,439
This is the hour.

476
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:04,876
Now is the time.

477
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:10,231
In God's name, strike!
Strike boldly!

478
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:12,318
- Forward!
- Forward!

479
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,194
Forward!

480
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:17,952
- Forward!
- Fire!

481
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,511
Fire!
Fire!

482
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:30,318
Forward! Man the slits!
Get those cannoneers!

483
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:35,078
Fire the catapults!

484
00:41:38,280 --> 00:41:39,508
Fire!

485
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:49,551
Hurry with the meurtriere!

486
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,151
Follow the white banner!

487
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,029
Forward! For God
and our country, forward!

488
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:18,598
Follow the banner!

489
00:42:18,840 --> 00:42:21,638
God is with you all, Lords! All!

490
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,315
Fire!

491
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,791
Break thru the walls! Close with them!

492
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,839
In God's name, forward!

493
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,311
The witch, the witch!

494
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,354
Stay there, coward!

495
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,117
Forward, my friends, forward!

496
00:43:28,040 --> 00:43:29,712
Up and over!

497
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:39,310
France! France!
God is your protector!

498
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:49,956
Forward! Forward!

499
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,751
Brave men, good soldiers, hurry!

500
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:08,152
On the walls!

501
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,435
Archer!

502
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:13,357
Hurry men!
Altogether, to the walls!

503
00:44:17,480 --> 00:44:21,155
I hit the witch!
She's down, she's down!

504
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:26,988
She's down, the witch is down!

505
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,679
Victory, England has won!

506
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:57,919
That must come out, Joan.

507
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,355
Hold my amulet, maid.
It will conjure away your pain.

508
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:20,036
Thank you, my friend.
No, no thanks.

509
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:25,358
I rather die than use sorcery.

510
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:28,240
I'll cleanse your wound with
ointment, dress it with lard.

511
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:31,039
Yes. Bind me.

512
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,998
And I lie here... for a while.

513
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,799
Father Pasquerel, do you hear.

514
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,556
- The Tourre has fallen.
- No, Joan. That's the note for recall.

515
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:04,552
We've been ordered to retreat.

516
00:46:08,920 --> 00:46:11,514
- Help me to my harness.
- Child, you are wounded.

517
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:14,117
I don't feel it.

518
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,873
No! No, men of France!
Do not give up!

519
00:46:25,120 --> 00:46:29,113
Courage men, do not fallback!

520
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:31,515
Laire, Dunois, Alenson, turn back!

521
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,915
Friends, come with me.
We must not give up.

522
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:36,560
We've done all we can this day, Joan,
our men are exhausted.

523
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:40,036
- The English are just as exhausted.
- We held a council and decided to retreat.

524
00:46:40,280 --> 00:46:42,669
You've been with your council
and I've been with mine.

525
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,549
And I say to you, the council of our Lord
is better and stronger than yours.

526
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,156
We need only to go forward
and the fort is ours!

527
00:46:49,157 --> 00:46:51,312
If she wants to attack, we attack.

528
00:46:51,560 --> 00:46:53,391
When my banner touches the wall

529
00:46:53,640 --> 00:46:56,518
- we shall have victory!
- Sound the trumpets, forward men!

530
00:46:56,840 --> 00:46:59,115
Forward!
Follow the banner!

531
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:04,996
On your feet!

532
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,838
Do not give up!

533
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,309
For the glory of France!

534
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,950
To the walls! To the walls!

535
00:47:26,080 --> 00:47:29,277
French men, French men!
There is no turning back!

536
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,593
We shall have victory, God wills it!

537
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:38,590
- To the walls!
- To the walls!

538
00:47:54,200 --> 00:47:55,952
Scale the ladder!

539
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,234
France, rise above!

540
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,313
Death to the enemy!

541
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:43,395
Forward men, this is the victory!

542
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:49,913
Resist!

543
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,997
Enter boldly, victory shall be ours!

544
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,678
God say yield!
God say yield!

545
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:21,516
God say yield!
Yield to redeem your life!

546
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,995
God say yield to redeem your life!

547
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,554
I'll never yield to you, sorceress witch!

548
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:35,591
You call me harlot, but I have great pity
on your soul and the souls of your men!

549
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:37,671
Yield to the King of heaven!

550
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:43,234
I say never!
Not to you, fiend from hell!

551
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,959
No, no, no!

552
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,076
Burn in hell!

553
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:02,513
Death by fire is a horrible thing.

554
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,394
Joan! Joan,
we've been looking for you.

555
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,313
Why are you crying?

556
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:37,359
I thought victory would be beautiful.

557
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:40,099
Look at this so ugly and bloody.

558
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,238
Why it was never a more
beautiful victory than this.

559
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:46,076
And it's your victory.
The whole city is waiting to receive you.

560
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:49,232
- You must lead the army through the streets.
- No!

561
00:51:09,640 --> 00:51:12,029
Our soldiers see her banner and run away.

562
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:15,789
Her victories will be remembered as
the most shameful episode of history.

563
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,912
I quite agree with you.

564
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,999
Mighty England and great Burgundy,

565
00:51:21,240 --> 00:51:25,677
the richest prince in Christendom,
beaten by a green country girl.

566
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:29,550
My Lord, did you come to
me for aid and advice,

567
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:32,479
I have this to say:
Think, Duke.

568
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,513
Think carefully before you reject
the maid and her invitation

569
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:38,075
to the coronation of your dear cousin.

570
00:51:38,360 --> 00:51:41,318
This no moment for jesting,
Count of Luxembourg.

571
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,919
And no subject toyed.

572
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,634
The fact remains that tomorrow
in the Catherdral of Reims

573
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,435
the maid will crown her dancing master,
the Dauphin, King of France.

574
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,831
She's victorious and she has
made no mistakes so far.

575
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:56,191
If she decides to march on París,
and no doubt she will,

576
00:51:56,560 --> 00:51:59,313
Paris will be lost... and we'll fall.

577
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:02,358
This is a grave moment in
the history of Burgundy.

578
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,955
- And of England.
- And of the church.

579
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:09,559
We had to deal with many heretics,
but none as dangerous as this one.

580
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,393
The maid a heretic?

581
00:52:11,800 --> 00:52:15,839
I thought the church had examined her
and found her good, pious and untouched.

582
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:18,236
If I had sat as judge of Poitiers,

583
00:52:18,350 --> 00:52:20,590
I can assure you the verdict
would have been different.

584
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,877
Count Bishop your hatred
for the maid is justified.

585
00:52:24,080 --> 00:52:26,080
Had she chased me from my
castle or I was noticed

586
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:29,317
I would have called her much worst names...
than a heretic.

587
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:32,911
It may be luck for us that
she's exactly where she is.

588
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:36,157
- Luck?
- She's about to make her first error.

589
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,155
Tomorrow she will crown Charles.
She should set the crown on her own head.

590
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:44,636
Charles is a fool, a gull, a knave.
He sold out to us before.

591
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,640
- He may do it again.
- You offer him money?

592
00:52:46,840 --> 00:52:49,195
Not I, you. For a truce.

593
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:51,908
For first time in a 100 years
France is victorious,

594
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:54,793
Why in heaven's name should
Charles grant us a truce?

595
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,396
Dangle gold in front of him and
he might take it, he always has.

596
00:52:58,640 --> 00:53:00,119
Tremouille is with him as usual.

597
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,311
And Tremouille would sell anything.

598
00:53:06,120 --> 00:53:09,351
Very well my Lord,
I'll send the messenger away.

599
00:53:09,960 --> 00:53:12,918
- Messenger? What messenger?
- By Burgundy.

600
00:53:13,120 --> 00:53:16,715
- He's here begging for a truce.
- Truce? What nonsense.

601
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,797
How much will they pay?

602
00:53:20,798 --> 00:53:22,958
50,000 crowns if you give
the order to stop fighting.

603
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:27,279
- And how much do you get?
- I? I... I've nothing to do with it.

604
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:31,076
Your usual share is half, my loving
crocodile and you haven't changed.

605
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,111
I want your share.
I want 100,000 in my hands.

606
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,831
And I'm not even sure that I'll take it.

607
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:39,599
What shall I tell him?

608
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:43,310
You tell him to wait, we are in no hurry.

609
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:47,628
Very well, my Lord.

610
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,593
Sire,

611
00:58:34,680 --> 00:58:38,434
this is the day we fought for
and waited for and it has come.

612
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:42,478
I'm as happy as any mortal has ever been,

613
00:58:43,080 --> 00:58:46,834
for I've watched the anointing
and the coronation of my King.

614
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:50,232
- Hurray!
- Long live the King!

615
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,270
Long live the King!

616
00:59:05,000 --> 00:59:07,355
Joan the Maid!

617
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,513
Joan the maid!
On to Paris!

618
00:59:21,120 --> 00:59:23,793
I'll see the messenger in the robing room.

619
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:43,352
- Oh, they didn't touch, they didn't touch.
- They kissed, they kissed.

620
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:44,999
Just as I kiss you now.

621
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:46,639
Your Majesty...

622
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,160
Only our kissing is a very
different matter isn't it, my dear?

623
00:59:49,161 --> 00:59:52,241
- Oh, your Majesty, you must take care.
- No, that's your part to take care.

624
00:59:52,242 --> 00:59:53,922
Mine is to be bold, careless and reckless.

625
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,989
To win the world I win
and depart when I choose.

626
00:59:56,240 --> 00:59:58,040
For look, the world is mine.
Look about you,

627
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:01,198
this is a real court now
and I'm a King to be reckoned with.

628
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,431
It is lovely, the scent of jasmine.

629
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,790
I could stay here in Sully forever.

630
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:08,315
Yes, well next week we must go to
Lausa to be feasted,

631
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:09,959
And the week after that to Pion.

632
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:11,840
There seems to be no end
to these invitations.

633
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:12,993
And to the tributes!

634
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:16,949
See?

635
01:00:17,200 --> 01:00:19,476
And for the reference, do
you remember that little

636
01:00:19,477 --> 01:00:21,751
tailor at Chinon who wouldn't
trust me for a new coat?

637
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,356
Now...
Nay, here comes that vulture again.

638
01:00:28,240 --> 01:00:30,160
Well Tremouille, do you
come to bring me money?

639
01:00:30,161 --> 01:00:31,281
Or to take it away with you?

640
01:00:31,560 --> 01:00:34,080
Your Majesty, this is a much more
important matter than money.

641
01:00:34,081 --> 01:00:37,510
The man's mad.
Here, take my place. And don't cheat!

642
01:00:39,520 --> 01:00:40,720
- She's here.
- Is she alone?

643
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:42,399
No, she brought Alenson with her.

644
01:00:42,640 --> 01:00:45,720
Remember Sire, it's absolutely imperative
that this time you keep your word.

645
01:00:45,840 --> 01:00:48,070
- When have I not kept my word?
- Yesterday.

646
01:00:48,480 --> 01:00:50,516
Well, that was yesterday.

647
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,152
Greetings, my friends.

648
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,596
Joan, we've asked you
into the presence because

649
01:00:55,597 --> 01:00:57,672
we've missed you, our
most favourite subject.

650
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:03,075
My noble King, for weeks we have waited
outside the walls of Paris for your arrival.

651
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,594
We should have struck in the hour of victory.

652
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,472
But it is not too late now.

653
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:10,911
Keep your promise.
Ride with us and.

654
01:01:11,120 --> 01:01:12,719
Paris shall yet be ours.

655
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:14,800
I'm sorry Joan but you've
to cancel all such plans.

656
01:01:15,323 --> 01:01:17,163
I have just negotiated
a truce with Burgundy.

657
01:01:17,164 --> 01:01:17,484
A truce?

658
01:01:17,600 --> 01:01:19,716
- That's madness.
- It's been too much bloodshed.

659
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,514
The Tourre has been terribly torn,
we need peace.

660
01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:25,553
Our enemies need peace, my King, but not you.

661
01:01:25,720 --> 01:01:29,030
Let them go home to their island and
they can have a good and lasting peace.

662
01:01:29,240 --> 01:01:30,992
We only have to go forward now.

663
01:01:31,240 --> 01:01:35,552
- And their last great stronghold will fall.
- I tell you I have decided upon a truce.

664
01:01:35,800 --> 01:01:37,552
I have decided.

665
01:01:38,800 --> 01:01:40,677
But you cannot do this, my King.

666
01:01:41,080 --> 01:01:43,799
It would mean that you
threw away all the advantages.

667
01:01:44,560 --> 01:01:48,030
We have fought so hard and
have given so much blood to win.

668
01:01:48,360 --> 01:01:50,954
- His Majesty has signed the truce.
- Signed it?

669
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:52,155
Yes.

670
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,158
And our King never repudiates his word.

671
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:57,311
You know how this looks, your Highness?

672
01:01:57,560 --> 01:01:59,790
Like betrayal or stupidity.
Or both!

673
01:02:00,040 --> 01:02:03,749
I never said that I was wise, I never said
I was honest, I never said I was handsome.

674
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,960
I'm not a particularly
good person to be a King,

675
01:02:05,961 --> 01:02:07,834
but as long as I am a
King, I will be a King.

676
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,192
What do you know statecraft?

677
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,360
What do you know of the experience which
the heads of nations must stoop?

678
01:02:13,490 --> 01:02:16,850
A ruler must compromise and bargain with
the lowest sort of people, even the enemy.

679
01:02:16,851 --> 01:02:19,359
Men are governed by corruption, they like it.

680
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,915
Men hate corruption and God hates it.

681
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:24,953
I don't know, but men take
to it very naturally.

682
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,550
Cannot be true.

683
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:41,879
My King,

684
01:02:42,560 --> 01:02:46,758
have you taken...
money from our enemies?

685
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:52,075
That is not a question the King
should answer. Or be asked.

686
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,995
Then you have done it.

687
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,273
You have betrayed us.

688
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,396
All of us.

689
01:03:05,240 --> 01:03:08,277
Your country and even yourself.

690
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:11,360
I shall tell the people of
France what you've done.

691
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,715
I hate war, I don't like battles,

692
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:19,311
everytime I see French blood flowing I can...
I can feel the hair rise on my head.

693
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,277
- With all my soul I prayed for peace.
- We are at peace.

694
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,715
We cannot have peace so till our land is free.

695
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:29,469
It happens that I am the one that decides
what war we fight and what peace we keep.

696
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:33,194
I warn you, make any dirty truce you like.

697
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,320
We'll march on Paris
with or without sanction.

698
01:03:35,321 --> 01:03:36,601
No my dear cousin, you will not.

699
01:03:36,602 --> 01:03:38,397
I ordered the dismissal of the army.

700
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,114
I'm sick of all these warriors
clanking about in armour.

701
01:03:41,320 --> 01:03:44,800
You Alenson, Laire, Dunois, all of you.
Put down your battleaxes, you're ordered home.

702
01:03:44,960 --> 01:03:47,315
And from now on, all commands come from me.

703
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,436
If my captains leave, I shall leave also.

704
01:03:51,640 --> 01:03:53,517
Not your captains, my captains.

705
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:56,553
And you also will do as you are told.
Not as you pleased.

706
01:03:57,240 --> 01:03:58,832
- About the present...
- Ah, yes.

707
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,999
Joan, we've decided to ennoble you
as a token of our gratitude.

708
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,913
And your town of Domremy
will be exempt from taxation.

709
01:04:05,320 --> 01:04:09,393
But you must remain with the court
until you are given permission to leave.

710
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,959
Now come and join us.

711
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,838
We'll meet again, Joan.

712
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:50,391
I was never much for... words, Joan.
Except for profanity.

713
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:52,836
This is beyond swearing.

714
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:56,717
Goodbye, dear friend.

715
01:04:58,360 --> 01:05:00,316
And good soldier.

716
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,675
Did you say your prayers this morning?

717
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:06,952
That's what I forgot.

718
01:05:10,480 --> 01:05:13,153
Remember me when you say them.

719
01:05:37,240 --> 01:05:38,468
Joan,

720
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,591
let me kneel to you this once.

721
01:05:42,120 --> 01:05:45,271
You are more to me than any
King or Queen could ever be.

722
01:05:45,760 --> 01:05:48,228
To me you are France and France is yours.

723
01:05:48,560 --> 01:05:52,109
You lifted her up when she was dying
and set a cup of victory to her lips.

724
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,197
We all drank from that cup.

725
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:58,479
To make a new nation of us.
Made new men of all of us.

726
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,197
Many have fallen and now dead,

727
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:04,832
as I could wish I were
now that this has happened.

728
01:06:22,826 --> 01:06:26,005
King of heaven,

729
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:28,644
I've come to fulfill a vow.

730
01:06:30,251 --> 01:06:33,561
The truce with Burgundy signed.

731
01:06:33,618 --> 01:06:36,894
We're at peace and I shall
wear this white armour no more.

732
01:06:41,290 --> 01:06:46,045
I leave it here, at your altar.

733
01:06:54,227 --> 01:06:56,104
We're at peace, my King.

734
01:06:57,650 --> 01:07:00,722
But not such a peace as we dreamed.

735
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:06,729
No, horribly and evil in armies,
this was much of the war to be fought.

736
01:07:09,772 --> 01:07:11,967
And our enemy is preparing.

737
01:07:13,274 --> 01:07:17,108
And we dwindle here from town to town,

738
01:07:17,535 --> 01:07:19,287
holding court.

739
01:07:19,831 --> 01:07:22,345
Receiving embassies and dismissing soldiers.

740
01:07:22,681 --> 01:07:25,149
From town to town we have feasted.

741
01:07:25,544 --> 01:07:29,537
From city to city I have attended,
doing the King's bidding.

742
01:07:30,891 --> 01:07:34,281
We must feast in many more if the plan holds.

743
01:07:39,980 --> 01:07:42,380
Oh, my sweet God,

744
01:07:42,383 --> 01:07:44,419
the food is bitter.

745
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:50,613
I would rather sleep on the ground again
and chew my handful of bean and rice and to

746
01:07:50,725 --> 01:07:53,805
face the rank of English spears,
for this way we shall lose all we have won.

747
01:07:56,514 --> 01:07:58,630
Even I can see that.

748
01:08:01,054 --> 01:08:03,443
And my voices have said nothing.

749
01:08:09,831 --> 01:08:13,062
If only my voices would speak to me again.

750
01:08:13,167 --> 01:08:16,842
If they would tell me what I should
do then I could sleep at night

751
01:08:17,127 --> 01:08:19,846
and accept what comes to me
but they are silent.

752
01:08:24,008 --> 01:08:26,158
I asked again and again.

753
01:08:27,072 --> 01:08:30,348
Must I remain with the King and his household?

754
01:08:31,033 --> 01:08:34,548
Busy with the nothings that fill these days?

755
01:08:44,328 --> 01:08:46,239
If my voices do not answer,

756
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,036
I cannot stay here.

757
01:08:50,576 --> 01:08:54,171
I must arm again and find the enemy
and fight as before.

758
01:08:56,104 --> 01:08:57,981
Let my voices speak to me if this is wrong.

759
01:09:00,568 --> 01:09:04,766
Let them speak to me now.

760
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,470
There is still no answer.

761
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:32,717
Then I must go.

762
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:37,149
And fight the enemy, King of heaven.

763
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:42,396
I shall find another armour, not this shining
one in which I rode as your messenger.

764
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:46,959
But another dark and humble,
fitting to a common soldier.

765
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:54,590
Long ago my voices told me
that I would be taken prisoner.

766
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,069
When it comes,
at least I shall have arms in my hands.

767
01:10:01,720 --> 01:10:04,359
I think I have courage to die.

768
01:10:05,160 --> 01:10:08,948
But not to die thus in small sick ways.

769
01:10:32,440 --> 01:10:35,591
Inform the master that
we've bring in the witch.

770
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,512
The maid is captured.

771
01:10:37,720 --> 01:10:38,948
Come here, look!

772
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:45,270
There's the witch! The witch!
The witch is a young girl!

773
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:54,996
So you are the maid...

774
01:10:55,240 --> 01:10:57,708
The peasant girl who leads armies,
crowns Kings,

775
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,196
and sets soldiers quaking in their boots.

776
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:04,034
As a French men, your great admirer.

777
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:08,512
As a Burgundian, your fortunate captor.

778
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:11,954
- At the gates of Compiegne?
- Yes, my Lord.

779
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:15,749
The city shut the gates in our faces,
we descended upon her and her few followers.

780
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,599
- We were careful not to wound her.
- Well done, captain.

781
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,229
My dear, look after her good health.

782
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:26,558
- You shall be in good hands, Joan.
- They've taken my ring.

783
01:11:27,200 --> 01:11:29,270
I want it back.

784
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:32,635
His Grace, the Bishop of Beauvals.

785
01:11:34,680 --> 01:11:36,989
- Welcome, your Grace.
- Greetings, Count.

786
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:40,391
A cup of wine?
Wine is always good over a bargain.

787
01:11:40,640 --> 01:11:41,789
Yes, thank you.

788
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,913
Seems to me, I remember this room
under less happy circumstances.

789
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,953
Yes, I remember you were a bit breathless.

790
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:50,912
You were running from the maid.

791
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,596
- Whom you now have.
- Whom I now have.

792
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,715
Shall I have the money sent up?

793
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:01,516
5,000 pounds is not enough, your Grace.

794
01:12:01,800 --> 01:12:04,030
I can do much better elsewhere.

795
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:06,788
5,000 pounds is a great deal of money.

796
01:12:07,040 --> 01:12:08,996
Kings have been ransomed for less.

797
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:11,160
But this is something
different, this is a witch.

798
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:12,675
Witches are expensive.

799
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,748
5,000. Yes or no?

800
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:35,195
I've use 10 bags.

801
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:40,519
The question is does each bag
contains 500 or 1,000 pounds.

802
01:12:41,680 --> 01:12:44,752
Bishop, could it be
possible that you're lying?

803
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,595
It looks to me as if you're authorised
to go as high as 10,000 pounds.

804
01:12:48,840 --> 01:12:51,638
If I said that I were, you would want 15.

805
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,480
If you're a true christain,
you'd give her up for nothing.

806
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:57,757
She's a sorceress, a heretic!
An idolatress!

807
01:12:57,960 --> 01:13:00,110
- She must be burned.
- Oh now, now... wait Bishop.

808
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:05,519
If this is entirely a religious matter,
why do you offer me English coin?

809
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,234
England is a true daughter of our church.

810
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:12,234
She's with us heart and soul,
in the matter of scorching this heresy.

811
01:13:12,840 --> 01:13:17,755
Oh, yes. When the maid beat the English.
Yes of course, that was heresy.

812
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,793
Not to mention her
putting you out of your Bishoping.

813
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,629
- Whose side are you on, my friend?
- This same side we're all on.

814
01:13:25,880 --> 01:13:29,316
The me side, what's in it for me.
That's my side, and that's your side.

815
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:34,270
And the English side, and the French side,
and the Burgundian side. Of course...

816
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,559
this girl, she's the only one
I know who is not on the me side.

817
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,320
And that's why I'm ashamed
when I think I would sell her.

818
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:46,116
- Yes, even for 10,000 gold pounds.
- Very well, 10,000. Will you take it?

819
01:13:50,550 --> 01:13:52,222
If I am not, may God put me there.

820
01:13:57,536 --> 01:14:01,165
If I am me, may he keep me there.

821
01:14:01,464 --> 01:14:03,629
That is a good answer, Joan.

822
01:14:03,630 --> 01:14:07,222
We can do without your comments.

823
01:14:07,230 --> 01:14:10,222
Who council you to throw off
womens clothes and dress like a man?

824
01:14:11,760 --> 01:14:15,594
A thing indecent... and contrary to the
teachings of the holy scriptures.

825
01:14:15,840 --> 01:14:17,910
For that I blame no one.

826
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:22,591
Having lived among soldiers it was more
fitting for me to wear mens clothes.

827
01:14:23,440 --> 01:14:27,592
But give me a woman's dress and I will
wear it if you permit me to hear mass.

828
01:14:28,120 --> 01:14:32,318
Otherwise I will not put it on since it
pleases God that I wear this one.

829
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:36,515
All I have done, I've done by the
command of my Lord.

830
01:14:38,400 --> 01:14:40,277
That is all that I've done well.

831
01:14:41,480 --> 01:14:44,392
How do you know that your
voices come from God?

832
01:14:44,600 --> 01:14:49,276
I knew that they came from God because
what they commanded me to do was only good.

833
01:14:50,640 --> 01:14:54,155
My Lords, I have answered
the same questions at Poitiers.

834
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:58,069
My King charged the Archbishop of Reims
and other loyal and learned priest

835
01:14:58,280 --> 01:15:01,238
to examine me before
I was allowed to lead his army.

836
01:15:01,560 --> 01:15:04,518
Send for the records at Poitiers,
you shall have all my answers.

837
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:08,673
The examination at Poiters by the Archbishop
of Reims has no relevance.

838
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:11,792
We are your judges now and
you must answer us!

839
01:15:12,040 --> 01:15:15,191
But you are not fitted to be my judges.

840
01:15:15,960 --> 01:15:18,190
You are my mortal enemies.

841
01:15:19,560 --> 01:15:22,518
English... and Burgurdians.

842
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:25,591
All of you.

843
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:29,118
And you are not the church.

844
01:15:29,320 --> 01:15:32,995
You are the valets of the enemy King
whose orders you obeyed.

845
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:38,471
If I am being tried by the church,
why am I not in a church prison among women.

846
01:15:38,640 --> 01:15:41,598
I am in a English prison guarded
by English soldiers and chained...

847
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,116
chained to my bed. If I must rise for
any purpose I must ask the guards

848
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:46,912
to unlock the bonds.

849
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:50,908
We, your judges, keep you chained
because you've attempted to escape.

850
01:15:51,120 --> 01:15:54,192
Is it not the right of all prisoners
of war to try to escape?

851
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:01,472
You say that you are my judges.

852
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:05,957
I do not know if you are, but I say this,

853
01:16:07,320 --> 01:16:10,232
take care not to judge me wrongly,

854
01:16:11,360 --> 01:16:16,229
for in truth I am sent by God and
you place yourself in great danger.

855
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,835
Take her back to her cell!

856
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,076
Good day, my Lords.

857
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:31,071
You and your flawless trial.

858
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:33,708
The girl's too clever for you!
She ridicules you!

859
01:16:33,920 --> 01:16:36,560
Yes and threatens you in public.

860
01:16:36,561 --> 01:16:39,199
I can assure you, my dear Warwick.
It won't happen again.

861
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:42,392
No it will not, for there
will be no more public sessions.

862
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:46,070
You will continue behind closed doors
according to my orders.

863
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:57,918
Is that the chapel, Father?

864
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:00,437
- Yes, Joan.
- May I enter?

865
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:03,356
No daughter, it is forbidden.

866
01:17:11,560 --> 01:17:13,118
Do you know why?

867
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:16,193
It is forbidden.

868
01:17:17,040 --> 01:17:18,314
Your Grace,

869
01:17:18,560 --> 01:17:21,035
perhaps we should not say
no so quickly to this

870
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:23,509
child's request concerning
the records of Poitiers.

871
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,879
Since we were not on the maid's side
in the war, we can hardly judge her...

872
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:31,430
- in unbiased fashion.
- This is an ecclesiastical court,

873
01:17:31,640 --> 01:17:34,916
governed solely by the
unbiased laws of the church.

874
01:17:35,160 --> 01:17:36,798
The laws of the church?

875
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:39,508
Do they demand English guards at the doors?

876
01:17:39,720 --> 01:17:42,109
Do they insist that English
gold bears the expense?

877
01:17:42,320 --> 01:17:44,788
- Silence Calleis.
- No, your Grace.

878
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:47,749
Such a procedure contravenes our laws.

879
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:52,229
- I can take no part in this trial.
- Then you may leave.

880
01:17:52,560 --> 01:17:55,518
And any of you who herd his
opinion may leave also.

881
01:17:55,760 --> 01:17:56,954
But remember this,

882
01:17:57,200 --> 01:17:59,998
if you go now,
you carry my enmity with you.

883
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:02,595
And the enmity of the King of England.

884
01:18:02,920 --> 01:18:04,592
The King of France and England.

885
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:08,989
I'm sorry to leave what to your mercy.
Or your lack of mercy.

886
01:18:09,440 --> 01:18:12,256
But for my conscience sake
I cannot witness what

887
01:18:12,257 --> 01:18:15,072
seems to me but a preconceived
and shameful farce.

888
01:18:36,480 --> 01:18:37,799
You will come with us.

889
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,270
- I?
- Yes. You're under arrest.

890
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:05,354
I should be in a church prison,

891
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,991
guarded by women.

892
01:19:08,960 --> 01:19:10,996
Must you leave me here, Father?

893
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:13,590
I'm commanded to leave you here.

894
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,991
God keep you, child.

895
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:42,679
Joan, this is Master Jean Laverne,

896
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:45,758
who has been assigned by the
most revered Inquisitor of France.

897
01:19:46,160 --> 01:19:48,037
To assist us at you trial.

898
01:19:48,280 --> 01:19:51,716
Master Jean has read all the reports
of the preceding sessions.

899
01:19:51,920 --> 01:19:54,514
And is therefore well
acquainted with your case.

900
01:19:54,720 --> 01:19:57,871
I am Jean and I promise you that
we will judge you justly.

901
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,157
But you're an illiterate
girl and need council.

902
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,158
You may choose one of the
judges to advise you.

903
01:20:04,360 --> 01:20:06,078
I thank you.

904
01:20:07,760 --> 01:20:11,514
But I have no intention of departing
from the council of my Lord.

905
01:20:11,720 --> 01:20:14,280
What do your voices tell you?

906
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,958
To answer you boldly.

907
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:22,473
Did they promise to deliver you?

908
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:26,238
Saint Catherine told me
that I would be rescued.

909
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:31,960
I do not know whether this
means that I would be

910
01:20:31,961 --> 01:20:34,559
delivered by a French attack
upon this city Rouen.

911
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:36,799
Or something else,

912
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:39,798
but I was told that I would be
freed by a great victory.

913
01:20:40,680 --> 01:20:44,036
- Can you remember the exact words?
- Yes.

914
01:20:46,200 --> 01:20:48,919
Accept everything with courage.

915
01:20:50,440 --> 01:20:52,749
Do not fear your martyrdom.

916
01:20:53,640 --> 01:20:57,474
For in the end, you shall be
in the kingdom of paradise.

917
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,315
What does the voice mean by...

918
01:21:01,520 --> 01:21:03,431
your martyrdom?

919
01:21:06,120 --> 01:21:07,394
I...

920
01:21:07,680 --> 01:21:09,477
I am not sure.

921
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:15,277
It may mean what I suffer here in prison.

922
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:23,393
Night after night, I have no sleep and still
I must come before you and answer questions.

923
01:21:24,640 --> 01:21:26,631
Same questions.

924
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:31,313
Come before you've met with
what I must endure in my cell.

925
01:21:31,840 --> 01:21:32,989
Without...

926
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:37,358
without rest, without rest, day or night.

927
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:45,670
I do not know how much more
I would have to suffer.

928
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,037
I reave for myself to God.

929
01:21:48,240 --> 01:21:50,157
This harlot mocks our court!

930
01:21:50,158 --> 01:21:52,118
You ask me questions I
have sworn not to answer,

931
01:21:52,320 --> 01:21:54,197
and yet you keep asking them.

932
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,908
What do you wish of me that I perjure myself?

933
01:21:57,120 --> 01:21:59,839
Scriveners, stay your hand.
Don't write that answer.

934
01:22:00,160 --> 01:22:04,358
Joan, if we proof to you that
you have acted against the faith,

935
01:22:04,600 --> 01:22:06,750
are you ready to submit to the church?

936
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,676
I beg you to believe that,

937
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,276
I would never do or say
anything against the church.

938
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:18,435
And if I have done such a thing
I would willingly reject it.

939
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,960
- That is a good answer Joan. Now I...
- If you accept the decision of this court,

940
01:22:22,961 --> 01:22:24,121
you would reject your voices.

941
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:27,480
If you still maintain that your voices
are right, you reject the church.

942
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:29,112
If you do not obey, you are a heretic!

943
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:32,596
I would not reject the voices
of my Lord nor the church!

944
01:22:37,560 --> 01:22:41,394
It seems to me that it is all one.

945
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:44,508
Our Lord and our church.

946
01:22:45,440 --> 01:22:47,795
Why do you make such a difficulty about it?

947
01:22:48,000 --> 01:22:50,673
Why did you display your
banner at the coronation?

948
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:52,518
It had shared in the toil.

949
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:55,395
It was only right that it
should share in the honour.

950
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:58,673
I appeal to the Pope who is at Rome.

951
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:02,832
Take me there and I shall submit to him.

952
01:23:08,520 --> 01:23:10,750
- Silence!
- Silence!

953
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:13,391
This is very serious, my Lord.

954
01:23:13,640 --> 01:23:16,359
- She is within her rights.
- This appeal is expensive.

955
01:23:16,560 --> 01:23:19,120
- We cannot proceed with the trial.
- We shall proceed.

956
01:23:19,760 --> 01:23:24,197
But if we were to continue, the trial
would be illegal and the verdict null.

957
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:28,678
- You're saved, Joan.
- The devil's tail, Priest!

958
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,957
If I see you whisper to her again
I'll have you thrown into the Seine.

959
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:35,112
As for this appeal to the Pope,
I refuse to allow it.

960
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:38,030
The King commands here, not the Pope.

961
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:40,954
He's paid a high price for this witch.

962
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:44,597
And he's also paying for
your services, my Masters,

963
01:23:44,840 --> 01:23:46,671
Doctors and Bishops.

964
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:50,554
That is why I appeal to the Pope,
who takes orders from no King.

965
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:53,913
The appeal is overruled.
Erase it from the record!

966
01:23:54,160 --> 01:23:58,517
Yes, you surely write what is against
me but nothing that is for me.

967
01:23:58,840 --> 01:23:59,989
Take her away!

968
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,796
May I have your attention, my Lords?

969
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:09,758
His Grace, the Bishop of Beauvals,

970
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,912
send me the articles of
accusation of this case,

971
01:24:13,120 --> 01:24:17,079
and ask me to give him my opinion
of the conduct of this trial.

972
01:24:17,400 --> 01:24:19,556
I assure your Grace, but
I would hardly hope that

973
01:24:19,557 --> 01:24:21,712
you would trouble yourself
to appear in person.

974
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:25,629
I fear that my letter might become lost,
as so many others have.

975
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:30,875
However, having witness today's session,
I am ready to render my opinion.

976
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,838
Write this down, Scriveners.

977
01:24:33,520 --> 01:24:38,355
I, Jean, Bishop of Avranche,
declared that this trial is unlawful.

978
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:41,630
That the appeal made by the accused

979
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:46,834
and witnessed by me among others,
is definitely and completely suspensive.

980
01:24:47,080 --> 01:24:49,833
And that all future procedure of this case

981
01:24:50,040 --> 01:24:51,871
must be referred to Rome.

982
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:56,678
- Why don't we go to my apartment...
- If the maid's appeal is overruled,

983
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,459
it is further proof of
the widespread rumours

984
01:24:59,460 --> 01:25:01,518
that circulate throughout
the Christain world

985
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:05,548
that this is not a religious
but a political trial.

986
01:25:06,400 --> 01:25:09,915
I warn you, you the so call judges,

987
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:12,315
you may suceed in sending her to the stake.

988
01:25:12,560 --> 01:25:16,519
But one day, your English King will
be ashamed of these proceedings.

989
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,719
Rome will declare the truth about this girl.

990
01:25:20,120 --> 01:25:24,398
And France will praise the maid
for it's birth as one nation.

991
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:31,513
And as for you, Pierre Cauchon,
Count Bishop of Beauvals,

992
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:37,789
I declare you a traitor, for you have
betrayed your country and you betrayed...

993
01:25:38,240 --> 01:25:39,593
your church.

994
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:45,670
Your Grace, at this time I cannot permit...

995
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,952
I will not permit...

996
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:55,399
Tomorrow morning, in the cemetery of St Ouen,
we've decided to hold our last session.

997
01:25:56,200 --> 01:25:59,192
With your physician's consent,
we are taking Joan there.

998
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:02,313
And if she again refuses to abjure,
we're abandoning her

999
01:26:02,640 --> 01:26:05,074
and handing her over to the civil authorities.

1000
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:07,914
I shall order the execution
under being readiness.

1001
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,312
This Joan, whom you see before you,

1002
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,478
has fallen from error into error,

1003
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:17,234
from crime into crime.

1004
01:26:17,640 --> 01:26:19,880
Never before in France has there
appear such a monster.

1005
01:26:20,720 --> 01:26:22,836
She's a witch, a heretic, a schismatic

1006
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:27,318
even her King himself is a heretic,
because he sort to

1007
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:29,268
regain his throne

1008
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:33,474
with the help of such an apostate,
we brought you here to this

1009
01:26:33,680 --> 01:26:37,719
sacred and divinest cemetary to give
you your last chance in public.

1010
01:26:37,960 --> 01:26:41,589
Will you or will you not revoke all the
acts to which your voices drove you

1011
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,229
and which where your judges have condemned?

1012
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,031
Burn the witch!

1013
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:50,593
Burn the witch!

1014
01:26:52,280 --> 01:26:55,113
I submit to God and our holy Father the Pope.

1015
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,191
The Pope is in Rome, we cannot go so far.

1016
01:26:57,440 --> 01:26:58,839
You must submit to us.

1017
01:26:59,080 --> 01:27:01,833
If you do not, we shall hand you over
to the executioner now.

1018
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:07,274
I submit to God and our
holy Father the Pope.

1019
01:27:07,275 --> 01:27:09,788
You must submit to us or die.

1020
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:17,830
If you submit, we'll send
you to a church prison.

1021
01:27:18,040 --> 01:27:20,040
Do you hear, Joan. If you
submit, you'll be taken

1022
01:27:20,041 --> 01:27:22,121
to a church prison where
there will be women guard.

1023
01:27:32,120 --> 01:27:33,314
Joan,

1024
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:36,348
he's reading the sentence
of your excommunication.

1025
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:38,592
Submit.

1026
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,830
- This means her death.
- Abjure, Joan!

1027
01:27:53,120 --> 01:27:54,519
Abjure!

1028
01:27:54,960 --> 01:27:56,871
Abjure!

1029
01:27:59,640 --> 01:28:01,631
Abjure?

1030
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:04,829
What does it mean to abjure?

1031
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:07,715
It means to submit to your judges.

1032
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:12,069
If you do, you'll escape the fire and you'll
be delivered from the English prison.

1033
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:17,310
Almost, sweet God.

1034
01:28:21,240 --> 01:28:24,152
Submit! Submit!

1035
01:28:29,560 --> 01:28:32,438
- Abjure Joan!
- Abjure!

1036
01:28:36,200 --> 01:28:40,193
- Abjure!
- Please abjure!

1037
01:28:42,360 --> 01:28:44,396
Save yourself! Save yourself, Joan!

1038
01:29:01,880 --> 01:29:03,791
I submit

1039
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:07,153
my words and actions to you.

1040
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:13,191
- I'll abjure than be burned.
- She submits herself! She submits!

1041
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:17,195
Damn!

1042
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,115
No, Joan. You'll sign your name.

1043
01:30:07,560 --> 01:30:09,391
Silence!

1044
01:30:10,240 --> 01:30:11,992
The maid has submitted.

1045
01:30:12,240 --> 01:30:14,356
We must receive her with penitence.

1046
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,269
In the name of our Lord, Amen.

1047
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:23,550
At last, you've come back to the
bosom of our mother church.

1048
01:30:24,160 --> 01:30:26,913
And thus we absolve you
from the excommunication.

1049
01:30:27,440 --> 01:30:29,954
But in order that you
should expiate your crimes.

1050
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:34,113
And to make sure that you
would not fall back into heresy,

1051
01:30:34,600 --> 01:30:36,909
we condemn you to perpetual prison,

1052
01:30:37,120 --> 01:30:40,635
to the bread and sorrow,
and the water of affliction.

1053
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:49,073
Father, take me to your church prison.

1054
01:30:50,560 --> 01:30:52,869
Give me women to guard me.

1055
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:58,158
No! No!

1056
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:01,477
They told me they would
take me to church prison!

1057
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,959
Oh! They lied to me!
They lied to me!

1058
01:31:06,960 --> 01:31:07,915
No!

1059
01:31:44,160 --> 01:31:46,549
Oh, sweet God.

1060
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:51,752
Forgive me. Forgive me.

1061
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,750
I was afraid.

1062
01:32:02,040 --> 01:32:03,393
What I said...

1063
01:32:03,880 --> 01:32:06,348
was for fear of the fire.

1064
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,590
I have damned my soul

1065
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:15,789
to save my life.

1066
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:01,314
You speak to me,

1067
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:06,599
and I denied you.

1068
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:49,830
Exactly as I expected.
She has not kept her word.

1069
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,840
- She meant nothing of what she said.
- She meant all that she said.

1070
01:33:52,841 --> 01:33:56,399
But we have not dealt honestly with her.
The guards are still here, just as before.

1071
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:58,160
She has retained the clothes of a man.

1072
01:33:58,366 --> 01:34:01,726
- She has broken her signed abjuration!
- We made it impossible for her to keep it.

1073
01:34:01,727 --> 01:34:04,247
- You exceed your function here!
- I appeal to the Inquisitor.

1074
01:34:04,480 --> 01:34:06,320
She shall have her
sentence and nothing else.

1075
01:34:06,321 --> 01:34:08,029
One moment, my Lords.

1076
01:34:08,400 --> 01:34:11,437
If this girl has been tricked
into breaking her vow,

1077
01:34:11,640 --> 01:34:14,200
I will not share in a sentence against her.

1078
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,792
If we leave your cell, all of us,

1079
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:20,117
will you put on this dress?

1080
01:34:27,000 --> 01:34:29,195
No, my Lord, I will not.

1081
01:34:31,000 --> 01:34:33,036
I've heard my voices again.

1082
01:34:34,400 --> 01:34:39,235
They told me I did a very wicked thing by
denying them but they have forgiven me.

1083
01:34:41,000 --> 01:34:45,949
I have faith in them.
I have none in you.

1084
01:34:47,680 --> 01:34:49,750
This is a fatal answer.

1085
01:34:50,120 --> 01:34:51,314
Joan,

1086
01:34:52,880 --> 01:34:54,836
Do you know what this means?

1087
01:34:56,520 --> 01:35:01,833
To live without faith is more terrible than
the fire, more terrible than dying young.

1088
01:35:03,880 --> 01:35:06,440
I have nothing more to do here.

1089
01:35:07,360 --> 01:35:09,749
Send me back to God for whom I came.

1090
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:16,352
Only a child!

1091
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:31,792
- Someone save her! Save her!
- Back away!

1092
01:35:45,120 --> 01:35:47,156
Back away! Back away!

1093
01:35:49,813 --> 01:35:52,280
You, the devil Bishop!

1094
01:35:55,780 --> 01:35:58,260
In the name of our Lord, Amen.

1095
01:35:59,400 --> 01:36:02,597
Could I have a cross!

1096
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:04,518
To hold in my hands!

1097
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:08,349
Ah, what shame that after the abjuration
of your errors, the devil of heresy

1098
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:11,751
has once more risen in your heart.

1099
01:36:12,480 --> 01:36:16,632
You've returned to your crimes,
therefore we the judges same decree

1100
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:20,389
that you, Joan, commonly called the maid,

1101
01:36:20,760 --> 01:36:24,070
have been on the subject of your
pretended divine revelations.

1102
01:36:24,640 --> 01:36:26,200
- A relapsed heretic,
- God bless you.

1103
01:36:26,201 --> 01:36:31,008
A sorceress, lying, seducing,
pernicious, presumptuous, seditious,

1104
01:36:31,304 --> 01:36:33,693
cruel, apostate and schismatic.

1105
01:36:34,057 --> 01:36:37,174
And so we abandon you to
the civil authorities,

1106
01:36:37,496 --> 01:36:41,952
requesting the same authority that it
may be pleased to moderate its judgement

1107
01:36:42,698 --> 01:36:45,371
and if true signs of penitence should appear

1108
01:36:46,193 --> 01:36:49,549
that the sacrament of penance
may be administered to you.

1109
01:36:52,640 --> 01:36:54,870
I am a good Christain.

1110
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,479
Executioner!
Do your duty!

1111
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:20,669
Thus the short life of Joan nearing its end.

1112
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:24,992
But the truth will emerge
in the pages of history.

1113
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,992
Her physical death was not a defeat

1114
01:37:29,440 --> 01:37:32,750
but her last and greatest triumph.

1115
01:37:40,200 --> 01:37:42,077
Father, pray for me.

1116
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:46,154
I will be damned forever,
I've burned a Saint!

1117
01:37:49,120 --> 01:37:50,348
Go,

1118
01:37:51,240 --> 01:37:53,037
child of God,

1119
01:37:54,320 --> 01:37:56,197
daughter of France!

1120
01:37:57,520 --> 01:37:58,475
Go.

1121
01:37:59,600 --> 01:38:02,672
- Go!
- Oh, sweet God.

1122
01:38:04,800 --> 01:38:07,268
You've been with me always.

1123
01:38:09,120 --> 01:38:11,270
Be with me now,

1124
01:38:11,680 --> 01:38:13,830
through the darkness.

1125
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:18,439
For I meant to hurt no one.

1126
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:23,354
Let none be hurt for me.

1127
01:38:24,200 --> 01:38:26,555
Come to her assistance, she sings of God.

1128
01:38:27,800 --> 01:38:30,360
Come forth to meet her,
the angels of the Lord.

1129
01:38:31,280 --> 01:38:34,989
Receiving her soul,
offering it in the side of the almighty.

1130
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:40,469
May Christ receive you with chorally
and may the angels lead thee to paradise.

1131
01:38:44,920 --> 01:38:48,151
And... and that the hour

1132
01:38:48,720 --> 01:38:51,837
of our death... amen.

1133
01:38:56,160 --> 01:38:58,390
Jesus.

1134
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:01,995
Jesus!
