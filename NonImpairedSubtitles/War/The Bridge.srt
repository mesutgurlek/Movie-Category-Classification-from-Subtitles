1
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:33,260
THE BRIDGE

2
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:09,860
- Do we get the bombs her too now?
- It won't be that bad.

3
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:13,900
Besides, the war is over soon.

4
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,820
Let's hope so. My son was
else at the medical examination.

5
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:19,620
- Sigi?
-Yes.

6
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:23,280
- But they can't draft him anymore.
- You think so?

7
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:26,380
Doctor, you'll have your
laundry back in 5 days.

8
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,540
The shirts take quite
a lot.

9
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,500
No need to hurry.

10
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,740
- Thank you, dr.
- Goodbye, mrs. Bernhard.

11
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,660
Fru Borchert,
what was that - a bomb?

12
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:40,700
Yes, that was a bomb.

13
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:41,780
The whole house was shaking.

14
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,500
- Do you know where it hit?
-They say it fell in the river.

15
00:01:46,644 --> 00:01:49,309
- Weren't you in the basement?
- With the horse?

16
00:01:51,666 --> 00:01:53,631
- Vent.
- Mange tak, jeg klarer det.

17
00:01:55,485 --> 00:01:57,672
Fabulous, how you
manage alone.

18
00:01:58,211 --> 00:02:01,035
With all the slaveworkers :
aren't you afraid?

19
00:02:01,294 --> 00:02:04,145
Yes, sometimes.
But I have to hide it for the boy.

20
00:02:04,449 --> 00:02:06,784
- Hello, mrs. Borchert!
- Hello, mrs. Bernhard!

21
00:02:06,992 --> 00:02:08,934
- I'll come with laundry later.
- I'll be home then.

22
00:02:09,155 --> 00:02:10,793
Mrs. Borchert, Albert
has told, that...

23
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:13,692
-... your boy has volunteered?
- Yes.

24
00:02:14,372 --> 00:02:17,385
- Do you allow that?
- Borcherts were all officers...

25
00:02:18,922 --> 00:02:21,198
- Thanks for your help.
- Don't mention it.

26
00:02:21,735 --> 00:02:23,040
- Goodbye.

27
00:02:29,489 --> 00:02:32,397
But it's important to know,
where the bomb hit...

28
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:36,111
They say, it hit near the bridge...

29
00:02:36,676 --> 00:02:38,147
Look...!

30
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:45,362
Ah, Mr. Ortsgruppenleiter
is going on a journey?!

31
00:02:46,573 --> 00:02:50,166
Oh, hr. Rendoff, you are
expecting new times!

32
00:02:50,597 --> 00:02:52,287
People, who undermine the party...

33
00:02:52,432 --> 00:02:54,080
... get quickly sentenced.

34
00:02:54,665 --> 00:02:56,458
Remember that, mr. Rendorff.

35
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:04,388
Emma! Now hurry!

36
00:03:05,316 --> 00:03:07,502
- But I can't leave everything behind.

37
00:03:07,718 --> 00:03:09,684
- Do you have the passport?
- Oh, I forgot.

38
00:03:10,118 --> 00:03:11,160
Just what we needed.

39
00:03:15,413 --> 00:03:17,076
- Mr. Forst!
- Yes?

40
00:03:17,244 --> 00:03:20,228
If you must take trees from my
forest, then ask next time.

41
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:22,972
The hell I will! It's
for the final victory!

42
00:03:23,128 --> 00:03:24,798
Don't forget that, mrs. major!

43
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:27,615
- Why do you shout?
- None of your business.

44
00:03:27,873 --> 00:03:29,524
Sit down there.

45
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:31,953
We also have to drive by the school!

46
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:33,828
We don't have time for that.

47
00:03:33,904 --> 00:03:35,636
But I have to say
goodbye to my son.

48
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:37,904
The train leaves in half an hour.
I've explained it to Walter.

49
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,194
Drive!

50
00:03:39,935 --> 00:03:43,567
Walter, Walter! Play me!
The play alone.

51
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:46,220
Hurry, boys!

52
00:03:47,369 --> 00:03:48,541
What are you doing there?

53
00:03:49,993 --> 00:03:52,283
Did you hear the bomb?

54
00:03:54,462 --> 00:03:56,084
It should have fallen
during lessons!

55
00:03:56,292 --> 00:03:57,943
Yeah, in math class.

56
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:01,153
The pilot should have our
schedule!

57
00:04:01,865 --> 00:04:03,415
Back to class.

58
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:06,065
Just ignore him...

59
00:04:07,592 --> 00:04:10,530
What a luck. Only half
a lesson english left...

60
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,399
...and the rest of the
afternoon is off.

61
00:04:17,857 --> 00:04:19,066
- Franziska!
- Yes?

62
00:04:19,295 --> 00:04:22,033
Do you come to the bridge?
The bomb should have fallen there.

63
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:23,721
Yes, but first we have math.

64
00:04:30,683 --> 00:04:31,708
- Hey...
- Yes?

65
00:04:31,894 --> 00:04:33,028
- Do you know what I have here?
- No.

66
00:04:33,792 --> 00:04:35,197
- Really not?
- No.

67
00:04:35,396 --> 00:04:37,022
Just show it then.

68
00:04:37,197 --> 00:04:39,298
- Look.
- Where did you get that from?

69
00:04:39,597 --> 00:04:42,465
- It was in the basement.
- What do you have there?

70
00:04:43,148 --> 00:04:46,087
A mouse. I'll let it run
during class.

71
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:48,410
You don't have the guts.

72
00:04:48,676 --> 00:04:49,953
Wait and see.

73
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,516
- There it is.
- Eew...

74
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:55,688
- Very funny!
- How disgusting!

75
00:04:56,049 --> 00:04:58,201
You're the biggest idiot
at school.

76
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:01,227
According to the latest news
Oberbach has been evacuated.

77
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,841
Oberbach! But then they're
surrounding us from south.

78
00:05:04,629 --> 00:05:05,732
They've forgotten us...

79
00:05:05,996 --> 00:05:07,771
They should come here,
so we can show them!

80
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:10,808
Us kids, huh?
"The hope for the future..."

81
00:05:11,056 --> 00:05:12,048
Let him alone.

82
00:05:12,244 --> 00:05:13,184
Shut up!

83
00:05:13,287 --> 00:05:14,676
The americans made
quite a wedge.

84
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:16,837
The we will get
cut off here.

85
00:05:16,998 --> 00:05:18,168
But we can attack
their flank there.

86
00:05:18,355 --> 00:05:19,645
We'll send in a
division of tanks.

87
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:21,215
Rubbish! That will just
create a hole in the front.

88
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:23,057
Maybe I can ask the generals...

89
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,953
...to join this lesson.

90
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:35,479
-Mutz!
- Sorry. I had to correct the front.

91
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:40,605
You like to play war, right?

92
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:44,293
- You want to become officer?
- No, he still wants to be engine-driver.

93
00:05:44,796 --> 00:05:47,369
- Really?
- Well, previously I wanted to.

94
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:52,820
Good. Soon we'll rather need
engine-drivers than soldiers.

95
00:05:53,488 --> 00:05:54,919
How do you mean,
mr senior-teacher?

96
00:05:58,085 --> 00:06:00,635
Of course first,
when we have peace.

97
00:06:01,018 --> 00:06:04,345
- Are you against peace, Borchert?
- Of course not.

98
00:06:06,411 --> 00:06:08,694
Let's continue the translation.
Hager, you start.

99
00:06:16,865 --> 00:06:20,528
<i>If you... don't
... treasure</i>

100
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:21,874
(love)

101
00:06:22,765 --> 00:06:26,490
<i>If you don't love me...
they shall...</i>

102
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:28,220
(find)

103
00:06:28,591 --> 00:06:30,035
<i>...they shall find me.</i>

104
00:06:31,061 --> 00:06:33,352
<i>If I die in the forest,</i>

105
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:36,682
<i>it would be better,...</i>

106
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:38,834
<i>than that you don't love me.</i>

107
00:06:38,758 --> 00:06:40,403
Yes.

108
00:06:41,345 --> 00:06:42,647
<i> my whole life long.</i>

109
00:06:45,364 --> 00:06:48,286
Thanks for your efforts, Hager.
And thanks to you, Franziska.

110
00:06:50,239 --> 00:06:52,253
Let's hear, how our
romanticists...

111
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:53,747
...translated these verses.

112
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,953
Read, Scholten,
you like them.

113
00:06:59,349 --> 00:07:01,146
<i> Night covers me in her cloak</i>

114
00:07:01,946 --> 00:07:05,919
<i>If you don't want me,
then let them find me.</i>

115
00:07:06,007 --> 00:07:08,300
<i>To die from their hatred,...</i>

116
00:07:08,454 --> 00:07:10,869
<i> is better to live without
your love.</i>

117
00:07:11,835 --> 00:07:13,577
<i>Who showed you this place?</i>

118
00:07:14,281 --> 00:07:17,182
<i>The love, that made
me be an explorer.</i>

119
00:07:17,496 --> 00:07:19,791
<i>It gave me advice -
I gave it my eyes.</i>

120
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:24,231
<i>I am no captain,...</i>

121
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,378
<i>but sail with me
to the farthest beaches,...</i>

122
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,189
<i>touched by the waves.</i>

123
00:07:30,622 --> 00:07:33,747
<i>You know, night now
covers my face...</i>

124
00:07:34,234 --> 00:07:35,790
<i>Else the girls blush
colored my face...</i>

125
00:07:36,069 --> 00:07:38,219
<i>and what you wanted
to ask me before.</i>

126
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:41,623
<i>I'd like to make time
stand still.</i>

127
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,736
<i>I'd like to regret, what
I said... right before...</i>

128
00:07:46,364 --> 00:07:48,138
<i>... and deny my feelings.</i>

129
00:07:48,499 --> 00:07:52,290
<i>Tell me, do you love me?
I know, you will say yes.</i>

130
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:55,762
<i>And I will trust your words.</i>

131
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:58,656
<i>But if you swear...
- Vorst, close the window!</i>

132
00:07:58,893 --> 00:08:00,627
<i> ...you might become treacherous.</i>

133
00:08:01,297 --> 00:08:04,725
<i>Maybe Jupiter is
laughing at us now.</i>

134
00:08:07,798 --> 00:08:10,104
<i>If you love me...</i>

135
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:13,197
<i>...that you quickly...</i>

136
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,020
<i>...will look at you...</i>

137
00:08:21,809 --> 00:08:23,400
Gerhard, close the window.

138
00:08:25,196 --> 00:08:26,263
Continue, Scholten.

139
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:45,983
Move your luggage away.

140
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,353
Can't you see, I have
a heavy suitcase?

141
00:08:49,914 --> 00:08:50,880
Thank you.

142
00:08:51,571 --> 00:08:52,944
Have a nice trip, bye...

143
00:08:53,818 --> 00:08:56,287
When do we drive?
Why are we still here?

144
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,898
Stop crying.

145
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:03,056
Be happy, that
you get out of here.

146
00:09:07,887 --> 00:09:11,955
Walter! Walter!
Be well, my boy!

147
00:09:32,772 --> 00:09:34,256
Well done!

148
00:09:34,602 --> 00:09:37,084
What are you doing here?
Why are you not in school?

149
00:09:37,564 --> 00:09:39,154
I couldn't even say
properly goodbye to her!

150
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,595
That's not so important.

151
00:09:40,734 --> 00:09:42,048
The main thing is, that
your mother is safe.

152
00:09:42,177 --> 00:09:43,975
- You only wanted to get rid of her.
- What do you say?

153
00:09:44,203 --> 00:09:45,089
Isn't it true?

154
00:09:45,311 --> 00:09:47,984
That's none of your business!

155
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:50,213
I want you to be a decent
boy, who...

156
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,248
Hi, mum!

157
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,146
Sigi, there you are!

158
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,500
I worried so much.

159
00:10:07,726 --> 00:10:09,297
Why?
We were in a basement.

160
00:10:12,137 --> 00:10:13,705
The whole english-lesson
came to nothing.

161
00:10:13,909 --> 00:10:16,372
English! What do you need
english for now?

162
00:10:17,807 --> 00:10:19,972
Come. We can eat.

163
00:10:21,679 --> 00:10:23,577
Soon there will be
bombings every day.

164
00:10:25,423 --> 00:10:27,077
You should stay home.

165
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,720
What can I do at home?

166
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:31,149
- What do we have today?
- Cabbage.

167
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,441
- Cabbage again!
- But I don't have anything else.

168
00:10:34,484 --> 00:10:36,073
I'll go to the bridge to see
what has happened.

169
00:10:36,156 --> 00:10:37,586
Do that afterwards.
First we eat.

170
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,712
Sigi! Come now!

171
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:50,297
What is it?

172
00:10:54,836 --> 00:10:56,514
Wait! I have to
feed Alberich first.

173
00:11:02,043 --> 00:11:03,356
Hi, how are you?

174
00:11:03,795 --> 00:11:06,392
- Sigi, I wrote to aunt Wally.
- And?

175
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:09,398
If you maybe could stay
there for some weeks.

176
00:11:10,245 --> 00:11:12,225
What? Should I desert?

177
00:11:12,493 --> 00:11:13,991
What will the others say?

178
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,330
What do you mean: desert?
You're not a soldier yet.

179
00:11:17,989 --> 00:11:19,840
Look! Wotan has again
eaten it all.

180
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:23,006
At aunt Wally you could eat
every day, too.

181
00:11:23,522 --> 00:11:24,238
And you?

182
00:11:24,312 --> 00:11:27,858
Then I could use your rationing-
coupons to buy for.

183
00:11:28,802 --> 00:11:32,110
I don't have anything left to trade.
And you need new shoe soles!

184
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:34,021
I'd rather give you Wotan then.

185
00:11:34,963 --> 00:11:36,177
But you won't get me
away from here.

186
00:11:50,381 --> 00:11:52,195
- Hello Karl!
- Thank you, ms Barbara!

187
00:11:52,376 --> 00:11:53,565
We had supper already.

188
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:57,073
- Oh, it's stuck again.
- Let me.

189
00:11:58,516 --> 00:11:59,613
Oh, how clumsy.

190
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:05,125
What is this?

191
00:12:07,283 --> 00:12:08,433
Give it to me.

192
00:12:10,537 --> 00:12:16,012
- What does this mean?
- Nothing. It means nothing.

193
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:17,973
I would say so, too.

194
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,358
I'm sorry.

195
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:23,889
But there's nothing
to apologize.

196
00:12:25,116 --> 00:12:28,058
- Go. Your father's waiting.
- Yes!

197
00:12:31,823 --> 00:12:33,888
<i>...women have now signed up...</i>

198
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:36,058
<i>... for the party's...</i>

199
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:39,153
- Hello dad!
- Hello, my boy!

200
00:12:39,303 --> 00:12:40,454
- Are you hungry?
- Yes!

201
00:12:45,877 --> 00:12:47,503
- But I have to go again.
- Where?

202
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:49,298
I want to see the bomb crater.

203
00:12:49,446 --> 00:12:50,642
Well, first we eat.

204
00:12:55,985 --> 00:12:59,359
If there is a bomb crater,
it will also be there after supper.

205
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:01,471
Thanks, son.

206
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:06,381
Give me your plate.

207
00:13:11,186 --> 00:13:12,428
- Do you want more?
- No, thanks.

208
00:13:15,059 --> 00:13:16,760
- Taste good?
- Great.

209
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:21,426
- What is Barbara doing?
- She's still busy.

210
00:13:21,723 --> 00:13:23,525
- So you wait for the evening?
- Yes.

211
00:13:23,868 --> 00:13:25,043
Here.

212
00:13:27,242 --> 00:13:28,230
I go downstairs
to look for her.

213
00:13:31,207 --> 00:13:31,894
These have to be
washed and ironed?

214
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:33,510
Yes, but I don't have time
before 6 o'clock.

215
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:34,954
The just come later.

216
00:13:35,331 --> 00:13:36,611
- Good day, mrs Weber
- Good day, mr Horber.

217
00:13:36,686 --> 00:13:39,180
- Mrs Weber will bring the laundry at 6.
- I can't earlier.

218
00:13:39,247 --> 00:13:40,797
My boss says, at the front they
don't get vacation either...

219
00:13:40,874 --> 00:13:41,938
...for a haircut.

220
00:13:42,246 --> 00:13:44,005
- Ha, what rubbish.
- Yes.

221
00:13:44,302 --> 00:13:46,622
How can he know?
He's reported ill all the time.

222
00:13:47,376 --> 00:13:49,161
- Just come after 6.
- Thanks.

223
00:13:49,317 --> 00:13:50,665
Or do you have plans, ms Barbara?

224
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:52,406
- No, mr Horber.
- Then I'll come after 6.

225
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:53,728
- Goodbye
- Goodbye, mrs Weber.

226
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:54,771
Goodbye.

227
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:57,934
Ms Barbara, have you seen...

228
00:13:58,045 --> 00:14:00,553
Have you seen the
soap-coupons?

229
00:14:01,226 --> 00:14:02,362
- Here in the box.
- Ah yes.

230
00:14:02,549 --> 00:14:03,620
- Are you done?
- Yes, dad.

231
00:14:03,719 --> 00:14:05,838
- When will you be back?
- I'll be at the boat.

232
00:14:05,901 --> 00:14:06,788
Bye, Karl.

233
00:14:09,186 --> 00:14:11,755
He's quite occupied
by this boat.

234
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:14,552
I doubt it. He's probably
walking with a nice girl.

235
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,658
I don't think so.

236
00:14:17,013 --> 00:14:19,457
- When I was 16 years old...
- Yeah, you!

237
00:14:20,662 --> 00:14:21,982
Where are those cigarettes from?

238
00:14:22,502 --> 00:14:25,584
Walter Forst. From the personal supplies
of the Ortsgruppenleiter.

239
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:28,041
- You want one?
- No. Not any of those.

240
00:14:28,989 --> 00:14:31,090
What kind of boy is
Walter Forst?

241
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:35,568
He's a great buddy.
But else: poor thing.

242
00:14:36,149 --> 00:14:38,587
- Why?
- He doesn't believe in anything anymore.

243
00:14:39,647 --> 00:14:41,357
And what do you believe in?

244
00:14:42,703 --> 00:14:44,944
Certainly in everything,
that dad had told me.

245
00:14:47,865 --> 00:14:50,502
Dad always said:
Sit straight!

246
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:54,290
Keep the bridles tight
without pulling them.

247
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,593
But back then we
had real horses.

248
00:14:57,306 --> 00:15:00,237
Well, this one shluldn't
suffer from it, right?

249
00:15:07,587 --> 00:15:10,821
That God, you have come, mrs.!
I already thought that...

250
00:15:11,227 --> 00:15:13,373
Trudel, there's no reason
for worrying.

251
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:14,960
Vladimir, come here!

252
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:16,694
On my way!

253
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,662
- Has the mail come?
- No, not yet.

254
00:15:24,955 --> 00:15:27,424
I can't understand, why my
draft hasn't arrived yet.

255
00:15:27,608 --> 00:15:29,916
They probably want to wait
until you've grown some more.

256
00:15:30,902 --> 00:15:32,789
This afternoon I will visit
the Jungleiter again.

257
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:35,208
Children in the war!
Just what we need.

258
00:15:35,386 --> 00:15:36,971
Mum, forbid her to
say these things.

259
00:15:37,175 --> 00:15:38,904
Relax. You know that she
doesn't mean it bad.

260
00:15:39,087 --> 00:15:41,792
- Here's our ration of soap.
- What they call soap.

261
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:45,463
- In the forest they cut trees again.
- Yes, I know.

262
00:15:45,748 --> 00:15:47,073
They need them for
barricades against tanks.

263
00:15:47,241 --> 00:15:49,351
- Our trees?
- I can't do anything either.

264
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:52,302
Let's hope they
leave the firs.

265
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:54,722
But a few firs don't matter.

266
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:56,731
If dad still was alive,
he's probably not mind...

267
00:15:58,121 --> 00:16:00,634
- You are right.
- Sorry.

268
00:16:01,581 --> 00:16:03,371
- Do you unharness them?
- Yes, of course.

269
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:08,219
Get going with
your work!

270
00:16:08,991 --> 00:16:09,681
Do something!

271
00:16:10,198 --> 00:16:12,140
There... Easy...

272
00:16:12,658 --> 00:16:15,223
Did I send wood enough
for your boat?

273
00:16:15,567 --> 00:16:17,632
Yes thanks, mum.
There's enough for two boats.

274
00:16:20,197 --> 00:16:22,587
Stop the noise, Walter.
I can't stand it.

275
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:23,767
I'll be done in a little.

276
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:25,833
Imagine you can read
with that noise!

277
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:27,422
It's alright.

278
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,069
- Good news from home?
- They have alarms now all the time.

279
00:16:30,226 --> 00:16:32,575
Mum writes that they hardly
get out of the basements anymore.

280
00:16:34,516 --> 00:16:36,498
And that she's very happy
that I'm here now.

281
00:16:36,701 --> 00:16:40,178
Me too. Who else has two
strong men in the house?

282
00:16:40,414 --> 00:16:44,280
Didn't you want to repair
the windows' blackouts?

283
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:46,566
- Yeah, I will.
- Then do it also.

284
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,911
- Still no mail from dad?
- No.

285
00:16:52,348 --> 00:16:55,441
- It's been 23 days now.
- Yes.

286
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,135
Mum, it doesn't need to
mean anything.

287
00:17:01,179 --> 00:17:03,866
Suddenly we'll get a
whole bunch of letters again.

288
00:17:04,267 --> 00:17:05,917
You know, during an offensive...

289
00:17:06,098 --> 00:17:10,329
-... they hold back the mail. So no
secrets get disclosed.

290
00:17:10,330 --> 00:17:11,330
You think so?

291
00:17:17,177 --> 00:17:18,671
See? Nothing happened.

292
00:17:19,404 --> 00:17:20,960
Just a little from
the banister.

293
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:22,578
The bomb must have fallen
in the water.

294
00:17:22,714 --> 00:17:24,658
- It was just the airpressure.
- Yes, nothing else.

295
00:17:25,635 --> 00:17:28,125
Stupid boys. Be happy,
that nothing else happened!

296
00:17:28,378 --> 00:17:29,763
He can talk...

297
00:17:31,650 --> 00:17:33,667
- Where is Sigi?
- Don't know.

298
00:17:34,698 --> 00:17:37,638
- Sigi! Sigi!
- What is it?

299
00:17:40,298 --> 00:17:42,265
How's our tree cabin?
Everything alright?

300
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,102
No special
damages or casualties!

301
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:49,744
I go home.

302
00:17:50,124 --> 00:17:52,923
- We go too, right, Franziska?
- Yes, for me it's ok.

303
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:57,916
See you.

304
00:18:03,402 --> 00:18:06,090
- Shall we have a walk?
- If you have time.

305
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,237
- I have time. And you?
- Yes, but only a little.

306
00:18:11,692 --> 00:18:13,146
The come!

307
00:18:15,966 --> 00:18:17,653
Klaus! Klaus!

308
00:18:31,908 --> 00:18:33,824
What was wrong during the
english lesson this morning?

309
00:18:34,407 --> 00:18:36,600
Yesterday you still knew
the text.

310
00:18:36,941 --> 00:18:40,662
Yes, but I can't stand this
sentimental rubbish.

311
00:18:41,355 --> 00:18:43,528
"If you don't love me,
then let them just find me."

312
00:18:45,532 --> 00:18:47,259
When you say it, I find
it funny, too.

313
00:18:52,062 --> 00:18:53,519
I have to go to gym now.

314
00:18:53,917 --> 00:18:56,786
- What's the time?
- 5 minutes to half.

315
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:59,108
But where's your watch?

316
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:01,686
When mum got ill, we
traded it for butter.

317
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:09,764
Here. It's a gift.

318
00:19:11,134 --> 00:19:13,407
- But you can't give me a watch!
- Why not?

319
00:19:13,638 --> 00:19:15,770
You are crazy, Klaus.

320
00:19:15,843 --> 00:19:17,932
The maybe you borrow it?

321
00:19:19,489 --> 00:19:20,991
Why?

322
00:19:21,348 --> 00:19:23,376
So you have something from me.

323
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:26,747
- But when you need it, you'll tell.
- Of course.

324
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:34,730
It's luminous.
Very practical at blackouts.

325
00:20:06,349 --> 00:20:07,826
- Come and help me...

326
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:27,226
- Can we?
- Yes.

327
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:29,921
Wait a second.

328
00:20:32,186 --> 00:20:34,138
- What is it?
- It's flat.

329
00:20:34,871 --> 00:20:37,581
Mum's biking on flat tyres.
Give me your pump, please.

330
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:40,839
- The pump was stolen from her, too.
- Hold it, please.

331
00:20:44,045 --> 00:20:45,286
Say, Hans...

332
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:48,842
- ...during the bombraids...
- Yes, what?

333
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:52,019
- Were you afraid?
- Yes, very.

334
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:55,517
- You were a real wimp?
- Yes, of course.

335
00:20:55,762 --> 00:20:58,652
- You simply admit that?
- Why not?

336
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:00,533
I don't understand that.

337
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:02,396
- Have you finished?
- Yes.

338
00:21:03,646 --> 00:21:05,619
I'm curious, if Walter
got some rope for the boat.

339
00:21:12,012 --> 00:21:13,515
Look, there's little Sigi.

340
00:21:15,294 --> 00:21:18,208
We have rope and wood!
The boat can float already.

341
00:21:18,504 --> 00:21:19,638
- Was it difficult?
- Why?

342
00:21:20,231 --> 00:21:22,523
Someone giving you
glue these days...

343
00:21:22,707 --> 00:21:24,957
There was noone to give it.
It was there all abandoned.

344
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,494
"Wheels must roll for victory!"

345
00:21:29,002 --> 00:21:30,549
Are you crazy?

346
00:21:32,064 --> 00:21:33,006
How mean of you!

347
00:21:33,822 --> 00:21:36,830
- Your a nice hero!
- It was just for fun!

348
00:21:37,124 --> 00:21:38,995
And you had to try this
with the weakest, right?

349
00:21:39,308 --> 00:21:40,169
- Cut it off!
- Look here!

350
00:21:40,944 --> 00:21:42,330
Here! Someone hid something.

351
00:21:42,653 --> 00:21:43,824
- Pull it up.
- It's a net.

352
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,571
- It's a fyke.
- There are bottles in it!

353
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:46,823
Oh boy!

354
00:21:47,077 --> 00:21:48,750
Must have been the
easter bunny!

355
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:50,660
- Easter bunnies don't bring booze!
- How do you know it's booze?

356
00:21:51,057 --> 00:21:54,356
- Real french cognac - 42%.

357
00:21:54,534 --> 00:21:56,765
And egg-liqueur!
So it was the easter bunny.

358
00:21:58,469 --> 00:21:59,711
Wonder who hid this here!

359
00:21:59,947 --> 00:22:01,412
Nobody with good conscience.

360
00:22:03,872 --> 00:22:05,376
We'll sell them.
How many are there?

361
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:07,635
1, 2, 3, 4...

362
00:22:07,977 --> 00:22:09,414
Let's hide them in the pipe!

363
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:10,660
Come on! Quickly

364
00:22:13,614 --> 00:22:15,698
- Sigi, you crawl into the pipe!
- Why me?

365
00:22:16,750 --> 00:22:18,007
You're the smallest.

366
00:22:19,014 --> 00:22:20,409
We have to share with the others.

367
00:22:20,761 --> 00:22:22,373
Why should the others
get any?

368
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:24,874
- Well, we found the bottles.
- No, I found them.

369
00:22:25,064 --> 00:22:26,522
The you'll get two bottles.

370
00:22:26,739 --> 00:22:29,324
"Common well goes before
own well", mr party leader.

371
00:22:30,885 --> 00:22:33,179
- You heard that from your dad!
- Now stop it and let's go!

372
00:22:35,227 --> 00:22:37,427
- And me? Who takes me?
- You can stay here, little one.

373
00:22:37,794 --> 00:22:38,785
Come on, I take you.

374
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:54,382
Throw to me!

375
00:22:54,887 --> 00:22:57,217
- We got booze for you! You want?
- We don't want any.

376
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:08,159
Give it to me.

377
00:23:21,337 --> 00:23:22,744
Where were you, Karl?

378
00:23:23,879 --> 00:23:26,237
- Is something wrong?
- No no.

379
00:23:27,366 --> 00:23:28,904
Then let's continue...

380
00:23:31,983 --> 00:23:34,826
- Hello boys, you got rope?
- Yes, mr senior teacher.

381
00:23:35,868 --> 00:23:38,306
- That was probably difficult.
- Yes, very!

382
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:42,072
Borchert. Tell your mother,...

383
00:23:42,268 --> 00:23:44,183
... that the sawmill sent the
last boards.

384
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:46,287
And I thank her already...

385
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:50,814
Where is Borchert?
Horber, fetch the boards.

386
00:23:51,121 --> 00:23:52,643
You should have fetched
the boards, Karl.

387
00:23:53,116 --> 00:23:54,531
Can you give me the
screwdriver?

388
00:24:05,504 --> 00:24:07,668
- They are all whores.
- What do you say?

389
00:24:08,277 --> 00:24:09,614
The bitches are all whores.

390
00:24:09,736 --> 00:24:11,879
- You're out of your mind.
- Your Franziska, too!

391
00:24:18,946 --> 00:24:20,082
Say that again!

392
00:24:21,341 --> 00:24:22,287
<i>...in three weeks...</i>

393
00:24:22,556 --> 00:24:23,621
<i>...the americans are here...</i>

394
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,653
<i>In Oberwald a group
of Hitlerjugend...</i>

395
00:24:26,804 --> 00:24:29,537
<i>-... defended that station for 2 days.
- And after the 2 days?</i>

396
00:24:30,707 --> 00:24:33,048
Just asking.
What happened afterwards?

397
00:24:33,340 --> 00:24:34,407
Boys! Boys!

398
00:24:34,535 --> 00:24:36,861
Look - here's my draft!

399
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:38,845
We have to be at the barracks
tomorrow morning at 7!

400
00:24:39,119 --> 00:24:39,913
Your draft?

401
00:24:40,042 --> 00:24:42,402
I talked with the Jugendleiter.

402
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:44,199
Whe do you have to be there?

403
00:24:44,379 --> 00:24:45,045
Tomorrow at 7.

404
00:24:45,269 --> 00:24:46,685
Of course! Without us
they cannot win the war!

405
00:24:49,687 --> 00:24:52,987
Private Walter greets private Schorten.

406
00:24:53,432 --> 00:24:55,358
How awesome!

407
00:24:55,629 --> 00:24:56,948
Private Walter, turn right!

408
00:24:58,641 --> 00:25:00,353
It's probably because my
father is fighting at the front...

409
00:25:00,465 --> 00:25:02,558
Mr teacher, don't build on the
boat with another class...

410
00:25:02,774 --> 00:25:03,805
It's our boat.

411
00:25:03,995 --> 00:25:05,943
We'll finish it, when
we're back from the front.

412
00:25:06,146 --> 00:25:07,522
The we'll build it
as a warship.

413
00:25:10,991 --> 00:25:12,681
- Mr teacher.
- Yes yes.

414
00:25:13,776 --> 00:25:15,629
I'll tidy here.

415
00:25:16,872 --> 00:25:19,543
- Let's go home now...
- Yes, goodbye.

416
00:25:24,137 --> 00:25:26,075
I wished it was
tomorrow already!

417
00:25:27,347 --> 00:25:29,521
- Hurry, Mutz.

418
00:25:29,664 --> 00:25:31,392
- And tell your mother.
- I will write her a letter.

419
00:25:31,703 --> 00:25:32,988
It would be easier to
telephone!

420
00:25:35,729 --> 00:25:37,208
Come on, it's late.

421
00:25:37,526 --> 00:25:40,972
- Hurry.
- Have you put the tools back?

422
00:25:41,111 --> 00:25:42,295
- Yes, ms.
- Goodbye.

423
00:26:29,944 --> 00:26:31,054
What are you doing there?

424
00:26:36,648 --> 00:26:39,559
Come up!
And make it fast.

425
00:26:48,176 --> 00:26:49,658
Give me that bottle.

426
00:26:51,189 --> 00:26:53,056
- Liqueur, right?
- I don't know.

427
00:26:53,586 --> 00:26:55,393
- Do you have more of that?
- Not me.

428
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:59,383
And the others?
Where did you steal them?

429
00:26:59,571 --> 00:27:01,303
Steal? We found them.

430
00:27:01,501 --> 00:27:04,911
Come with me. Not reporting a find:
punishment of 3 years.

431
00:27:05,219 --> 00:27:07,144
But I have to go
to the army tomorrow.

432
00:27:09,364 --> 00:27:10,265
You have to what?

433
00:27:10,688 --> 00:27:12,204
Yes, the draft is at home.

434
00:27:13,097 --> 00:27:16,422
Really! Do I still have
to come to the policestation?

435
00:27:17,394 --> 00:27:20,738
Nope! We go home to mum,
so she can dry you first.

436
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:32,127
Sigi!

437
00:27:36,397 --> 00:27:37,580
What has happened?

438
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:39,954
I fell in the water.

439
00:27:41,102 --> 00:27:42,428
Has my draft arrived?

440
00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:44,800
- Yes.
- Where is it?

441
00:27:52,793 --> 00:27:55,483
He... he can't become
a soldier already!

442
00:27:56,118 --> 00:27:58,512
- He's just a child.
- I'm not a child!

443
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,386
And how do you look!
You're all wet!

444
00:28:01,550 --> 00:28:04,674
- That's not important!
- Out of your wet clothes!

445
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:07,342
Else you'll be in bed
tomorrow with pneunomia.

446
00:28:07,415 --> 00:28:09,927
No way!
I have to be at the barracks tomorrow.

447
00:28:12,403 --> 00:28:13,265
Hr. Vorschläger!

448
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:17,950
This must be a mistake!
You must know.

449
00:28:18,498 --> 00:28:20,853
No. They draft everybody now.

450
00:28:22,884 --> 00:28:24,789
Then I'll send you away.
Sit down.

451
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,303
I'll send you to aunt Wally. Yes.

452
00:28:29,097 --> 00:28:30,437
There you can hide.

453
00:28:30,854 --> 00:28:32,417
I'm not a deserter!

454
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:36,506
Hr. Vorschläger,
what shall I do?

455
00:28:37,304 --> 00:28:39,051
I donb't think, you can do anything.

456
00:28:42,046 --> 00:28:46,275
And about this liqueur... I'll
close my eyes this time.

457
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,528
Where is the liqueur from?

458
00:28:49,748 --> 00:28:51,567
You can trade it!
And Wotan, too.

459
00:28:51,888 --> 00:28:53,150
Thank you.

460
00:28:53,464 --> 00:28:56,552
The boys had a secret stock of liqueur -
and that's illegal, of course.

461
00:28:56,889 --> 00:29:01,135
Illegal? But then put Sigi
in jail, until it's all over!

462
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:06,708
Or...
this is insane!

463
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:10,139
I can't say anything about this.

464
00:29:10,295 --> 00:29:12,567
I'm on duty.
You have to understand.

465
00:29:19,206 --> 00:29:20,284
Mum?

466
00:29:20,575 --> 00:29:21,395
Yes, Sigi?

467
00:29:21,556 --> 00:29:23,627
Do you still have the little suitcase?
Can I borrow it?

468
00:29:25,126 --> 00:29:27,140
You want to go to aunt
Wally anyway?

469
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:29,929
I don't want to have a
cardboard box for the barracks...

470
00:29:30,259 --> 00:29:38,841
-... that looks stupid.
- Yes... I understand.

471
00:29:46,399 --> 00:29:49,889
- Hello lad. There you are.
- Yes. Why?

472
00:29:51,613 --> 00:29:54,634
There's something for you.
Your draft.

473
00:30:00,505 --> 00:30:02,531
Karl, it can't become so bad.

474
00:30:03,548 --> 00:30:06,304
First they have to train
you some months,...

475
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:08,964
- ...and then...
- So now you get rid of me!

476
00:30:10,163 --> 00:30:11,689
- What do you mean?
- I've seen you two!

477
00:30:15,778 --> 00:30:19,585
Get out! What do you want?
I don't want to see you here.

478
00:30:19,780 --> 00:30:20,667
Karl!

479
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:23,885
Go! I don't want to see you!
Out!

480
00:30:24,046 --> 00:30:25,161
Are you insane?

481
00:30:30,588 --> 00:30:32,848
Barbara,
let us alone for a minute.

482
00:30:35,895 --> 00:30:37,050
What's up, Karl?

483
00:30:37,176 --> 00:30:39,305
You're happy that I leave!
Then it's just you two here!

484
00:30:40,077 --> 00:30:44,294
Karl ... I don't know...
why you are like this.

485
00:30:45,536 --> 00:30:47,689
When two adult persons
like Barbara and me...

486
00:30:49,879 --> 00:30:51,487
You like Barbara, too...

487
00:30:52,681 --> 00:30:54,769
Would it be so bad, if
she stayed with us?

488
00:30:57,490 --> 00:30:58,980
Stop packing!

489
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:01,550
That can wait until
tomorrow morning.

490
00:31:04,259 --> 00:31:07,141
When you get sensible again,
you can come down to us.

491
00:31:07,293 --> 00:31:08,846
Then we can talk.

492
00:31:10,987 --> 00:31:13,076
<i>No idea what happened
with the boy.</i>

493
00:31:13,043 --> 00:31:15,412
<i>Don't be angry.
He's still a child.</i>

494
00:31:15,564 --> 00:31:18,029
<i>You're right. I thought,
he would be a man already.</i>

495
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:20,600
<i>And they send these kids in the war!</i>

496
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:22,753
<i>They don't belong in barracks,
but in a kindergarten!</i>

497
00:31:22,818 --> 00:31:25,718
<i>- Relax!
- They should be in the kindergarten!</i>

498
00:31:29,437 --> 00:31:31,166
You also have to send the tractor
to the garage, mum.

499
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:36,744
Don't worry, Jürgen, I'll take care
of everything.

500
00:31:40,394 --> 00:31:45,570
- Madam! The slaveworkers have
all disappeared! - What?!

501
00:31:45,939 --> 00:31:47,358
What shall we do now?

502
00:31:47,718 --> 00:31:49,674
We should inform the police...

503
00:31:49,779 --> 00:31:51,601
- ...or the party's...
- No!

504
00:31:51,934 --> 00:31:55,047
I don't want these people
in my house today!

505
00:31:55,769 --> 00:31:57,615
But the laws are so strict!

506
00:31:57,737 --> 00:32:01,360
When two of them disappared at
Letmanns, and they didn't report it...

507
00:32:01,476 --> 00:32:04,323
Yes, I know.
I'll take care of it tomorrow.

508
00:32:06,879 --> 00:32:10,301
- Trudel, would you leave us, please?
- Yes.

509
00:32:11,498 --> 00:32:13,940
How will you manage
without workers?

510
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:16,506
Maybe they will send others.

511
00:32:16,716 --> 00:32:18,807
But ours just got used to it.
Who knows, who they send now?

512
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:21,638
Yes? What can I do about it?

513
00:32:22,253 --> 00:32:25,377
- It's all become so strange.
- You can say that.

514
00:32:25,815 --> 00:32:27,595
And exactly now I have to leave!

515
00:32:27,809 --> 00:32:33,403
Jürgen, you know me.
I can defend myself!

516
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,635
But that's father's pistol!

517
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:39,761
Yes. They sent it after his death.

518
00:32:43,385 --> 00:32:49,224
- Mum. Can I have it?
- Take it.

519
00:32:52,344 --> 00:32:53,329
Thanks, mother.

520
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:02,973
You have no idea,
how glad I am.

521
00:33:03,797 --> 00:33:06,146
Dad taught me to shoot
with it.

522
00:33:08,974 --> 00:33:11,731
As officer-applicant
I am allowed to carry a weapon.

523
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:13,866
When do you have to
get up tomorrow?

524
00:33:13,920 --> 00:33:16,403
- We'll have breakfast together!
- Of course.

525
00:33:17,613 --> 00:33:19,757
I will have us woken
at half past 5.

526
00:33:20,406 --> 00:33:25,355
- Good night, mum.
- Good night, my boy.

527
00:33:27,261 --> 00:33:30,609
You're fantastic!
You're always classy.

528
00:33:33,107 --> 00:33:36,334
Don't pack too much. It has to fit
in a rucksack.

529
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,100
- Here, your cardigan.
- Put it there.

530
00:33:39,239 --> 00:33:41,303
- What do you want with the knife?
- I'll take it with me.

531
00:33:41,654 --> 00:33:42,945
We're not playing
cowboys and indians.

532
00:33:43,570 --> 00:33:45,605
But the Jungführer said, that one
doesn't shoot at night.

533
00:33:45,876 --> 00:33:48,205
- At night you work with a knife.
- Rubbish.

534
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,889
He read too many novels.

535
00:33:51,688 --> 00:33:53,471
Hans, you have to write home also.

536
00:33:54,723 --> 00:33:58,053
- Here are more socks.
- But we'll get them at the army.

537
00:33:58,278 --> 00:33:59,966
You have to have some
to change.

538
00:34:00,314 --> 00:34:02,824
"During the battle the
warriors changed socks!"

539
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:06,686
How mum imagines the war!

540
00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:08,932
I don't want to imagine it at all.

541
00:34:09,405 --> 00:34:12,277
Look! You wear them out so much,
that they can't be mended anymore.

542
00:34:13,453 --> 00:34:15,466
I think, those are mine.
I'll do it.

543
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:18,159
- Do you do it at home too?
- No.

544
00:34:19,288 --> 00:34:20,616
Mum, I also need soap.

545
00:34:20,925 --> 00:34:23,897
There's a piece in the
kitchen drawer.

546
00:34:24,032 --> 00:34:25,501
- You can share that.
- Thank you.

547
00:34:26,788 --> 00:34:28,355
Fabulous: soap!

548
00:34:28,703 --> 00:34:31,040
If I had known that,
I would have taken it long ago.

549
00:34:41,366 --> 00:34:43,989
- Mrs Mutz...
- Yes?

550
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:46,962
I...

551
00:34:48,550 --> 00:34:51,490
I want to thank you
for letting me stay here.

552
00:34:52,529 --> 00:34:57,698
But Hans... Then I have to thank you
for being here.

553
00:34:58,118 --> 00:34:59,791
Why?

554
00:35:01,163 --> 00:35:04,183
It was so good, that you were here.
For Albert and...

555
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,441
You're already so adult.

556
00:35:08,428 --> 00:35:10,202
Ha, if my mother could hear that!

557
00:35:10,343 --> 00:35:11,968
<i>I can't find the soap.</i>

558
00:35:12,670 --> 00:35:14,695
Look in the kitchen closet.

559
00:35:17,222 --> 00:35:19,884
I beg you, Hans, take care of him!

560
00:35:20,068 --> 00:35:25,150
Yes... now you said "du"
for the first time.

561
00:35:28,456 --> 00:35:30,866
I promise.
I'll take care of him.

562
00:35:31,126 --> 00:35:34,396
And take care of
yourself, too.

563
00:35:38,101 --> 00:35:40,223
Tomorrow you'll have lessons
without me.

564
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,520
That's not funny at all.

565
00:35:53,628 --> 00:35:55,425
Hello? Post office 2?

566
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:59,345
No, the mail wagon comes with
the passenger train 12:17. Right.

567
00:35:59,607 --> 00:36:01,632
Yes, that's changed.

568
00:36:02,342 --> 00:36:06,629
Klaus, we have problems
again with 12:17.

569
00:36:09,815 --> 00:36:12,086
What will your parents say,
that you're out so late?

570
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:13,824
They'll get angry.

571
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:16,146
Shouldn't you rather
go home then?

572
00:36:16,310 --> 00:36:20,005
- Today I don't care.
- Really?

573
00:36:30,109 --> 00:36:33,923
- Will it take long?
- If there's an airraid on Berlin...

574
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:36,321
... we won't get any connection.

575
00:36:36,838 --> 00:36:40,310
- Couldn't you try again?
- Ok, I'll try.

576
00:36:43,752 --> 00:36:45,374
Can I have 3-14?

577
00:36:48,744 --> 00:36:51,392
Otto? How is the air situation?

578
00:36:51,969 --> 00:36:53,459
Ah, thanks.

579
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:57,856
Right now there's only a raid
on Hannover-Braunschweig.

580
00:36:58,083 --> 00:36:59,373
Maybe we're lucky.

581
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:06,029
What's the time now?

582
00:37:07,257 --> 00:37:09,750
See! One can see it clearly
with the luminous numbers.

583
00:37:12,784 --> 00:37:14,473
- Franziska?
- Yes?

584
00:37:15,054 --> 00:37:18,074
- I want to ask you something.
- What?

585
00:37:18,578 --> 00:37:20,971
But don't get angry.

586
00:37:21,846 --> 00:37:23,535
Are you sure?

587
00:37:23,690 --> 00:37:27,741
You can ask me everything, Klaus.
It's our last evening together.

588
00:37:28,802 --> 00:37:30,957
Can I have the watch back?

589
00:37:37,354 --> 00:37:41,577
When I'm on patrol at night,
such a luminous watch is practical.

590
00:37:44,398 --> 00:37:47,499
Here post office 2 - is that Bremen?

591
00:37:52,915 --> 00:37:54,896
- Can I talk now?
- Yes.

592
00:37:56,255 --> 00:37:58,445
Hello, mum. Are you there?

593
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:01,770
What? How?
No, I'm fine.

594
00:38:02,885 --> 00:38:04,651
Listen, I'll be drafted
tomorrow!

595
00:38:16,275 --> 00:38:18,548
What do you want?
Did you get lost?

596
00:38:19,381 --> 00:38:21,948
- Here's my draft.
- Draft?

597
00:38:22,086 --> 00:38:23,741
But not at this hour.

598
00:38:23,779 --> 00:38:25,131
Can't you wait until
tomorrow morning?

599
00:38:25,343 --> 00:38:27,082
He's afraid, he'll miss
the free beer.

600
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:28,999
<i>Alarm! Alarm!
- Silent!</i>

601
00:38:29,301 --> 00:38:31,059
<i>The bombraid over
Hannover-Braunschweig...</i>

602
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:32,251
Louder!

603
00:38:32,331 --> 00:38:33,756
<i>...has turned east..</i>

604
00:38:33,873 --> 00:38:35,422
<i>An attack on Berlin is expected.</i>

605
00:38:35,573 --> 00:38:36,932
Sounds nice.

606
00:38:37,203 --> 00:38:39,851
We can't use you here, boy.

607
00:38:40,039 --> 00:38:41,754
Here you come precisely.

608
00:38:46,204 --> 00:38:47,561
I can't go home.

609
00:38:49,204 --> 00:38:51,378
Let him stay, Paul.

610
00:38:52,608 --> 00:38:54,279
Alright. Lie down there.

611
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:06,957
- Here's a blanket.
- Thank you.

612
00:39:18,464 --> 00:39:20,806
Your father tells you to
turn off the negro music.

613
00:39:22,334 --> 00:39:23,548
It bothers him.

614
00:39:25,486 --> 00:39:27,127
- It bothers him? Why?
- I don't know.

615
00:39:31,864 --> 00:39:33,068
<i>Tell him to turn off
that music!</i>

616
00:39:38,937 --> 00:39:42,233
And bring my dark suit.
There's still room here.

617
00:39:42,761 --> 00:39:44,082
Where is...?

618
00:39:49,281 --> 00:39:50,611
Are you going on
vacation?

619
00:39:51,548 --> 00:39:55,366
Walter, I have to leave.
I got...

620
00:39:55,633 --> 00:39:58,524
... a call from the headquarter.
Where are the cigarettes?

621
00:39:59,187 --> 00:40:01,459
Everything in this house
is a mess!

622
00:40:02,295 --> 00:40:05,367
We have an important meeting...

623
00:40:05,513 --> 00:40:07,071
And for that you need
the dark suit?

624
00:40:07,234 --> 00:40:08,400
Don't interfere.

625
00:40:08,601 --> 00:40:09,886
- None of your business.
- Here it is.

626
00:40:10,038 --> 00:40:11,021
Give it to me.

627
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:16,242
Tomorrow I'll become
a soldier, dad.

628
00:40:16,477 --> 00:40:18,073
Yes, I know.

629
00:40:18,756 --> 00:40:20,420
But the party leader
goes on the run!

630
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:22,950
"For Führer, people
fatherland!"

631
00:40:24,245 --> 00:40:25,724
Do you also take ms
Möhlmann with you?

632
00:40:26,033 --> 00:40:28,082
- What?
- Her from the economy office.

633
00:40:28,374 --> 00:40:30,358
- Shut up!
- The whole town knows it!

634
00:40:30,666 --> 00:40:31,945
That you sent mum away...

635
00:40:32,062 --> 00:40:33,666
...so you can have fun
with this whore!

636
00:40:33,977 --> 00:40:36,298
- Have you been drinking?
- Yes, from your bottles.

637
00:40:36,744 --> 00:40:39,713
Those reserved for the
front soldiers.

638
00:40:41,218 --> 00:40:42,453
Shame on you!

639
00:40:45,984 --> 00:40:47,375
When we meet again
after the war...

640
00:40:47,419 --> 00:40:50,513
Trust me. We won't
meet again!

641
00:40:51,082 --> 00:40:54,635
Just see tomorrow:
They'll teach you how to behave!

642
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:56,782
They'll teach you to march!

643
00:40:57,167 --> 00:40:59,548
It's time that
you learn discipline!

644
00:40:59,723 --> 00:41:01,951
Brat! But they'll make
a man out of you!

645
00:41:02,096 --> 00:41:03,131
A man like you?

646
00:41:35,972 --> 00:41:37,855
Have you slept with my
father, too?

647
00:41:38,166 --> 00:41:41,231
Say something! Speak!

648
00:41:42,314 --> 00:41:45,009
Your father shows
much more tenderness!

649
00:41:56,089 --> 00:41:58,459
First group!
Attention - get up!

650
00:41:59,385 --> 00:42:01,701
Turn right! Forward!

651
00:42:04,751 --> 00:42:06,935
Do you think, we can make
soldiers out of these boys?

652
00:42:07,213 --> 00:42:10,909
No. Cover!
Crawl into the soil!

653
00:42:11,154 --> 00:42:15,998
Head down!
Do you want it shot off?

654
00:42:16,503 --> 00:42:18,667
What will you think with then?

655
00:42:19,587 --> 00:42:21,635
Whole group! Back!

656
00:42:24,828 --> 00:42:25,957
Cover!

657
00:42:26,435 --> 00:42:28,611
You don't need to train "Back" -
they can do that already.

658
00:42:28,893 --> 00:42:30,182
What's the idea of this?

659
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:31,589
Ask them up high!

660
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:34,899
Whole group turn right!
Forward!

661
00:42:35,667 --> 00:42:36,929
Cover!

662
00:42:38,094 --> 00:42:39,567
I'm beaten.

663
00:42:39,618 --> 00:42:41,779
Whole group forward!

664
00:42:42,878 --> 00:42:44,355
Cover!

665
00:42:45,685 --> 00:42:49,084
Turn right and forward!

666
00:43:00,468 --> 00:43:02,937
Excuse me, but I have to
finish these papers.

667
00:43:04,759 --> 00:43:06,771
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

668
00:43:08,698 --> 00:43:10,311
Make sure, we won't
be disturbed.

669
00:43:15,679 --> 00:43:16,862
What can I do for you?

670
00:43:18,431 --> 00:43:20,384
The boys from my class...

671
00:43:21,117 --> 00:43:23,491
... are in your division.
- Yes, I know.

672
00:43:25,396 --> 00:43:32,335
Mr Fröhlich... I come to
you as a colleague...

673
00:43:32,905 --> 00:43:34,804
You are teacher, too.

674
00:43:36,158 --> 00:43:37,899
I've been soldier now for 5 years.

675
00:43:38,901 --> 00:43:41,531
- Yo are not in the service?
- No, because of my heart.

676
00:43:44,295 --> 00:43:46,547
What do you teach?

677
00:43:47,005 --> 00:43:48,613
English, history, german...

678
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:52,262
I assume, you've come to
talk about your students.

679
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,189
Yes. I want to ask you a favor.

680
00:43:55,947 --> 00:43:58,450
I can't understand, why
these children...

681
00:43:58,638 --> 00:44:00,281
...have to be sacrificed so
meaningless.

682
00:44:01,119 --> 00:44:03,436
I talked with the boys, mr Stern...

683
00:44:03,536 --> 00:44:06,438
They are idealists.
They believe, that they fight...

684
00:44:06,641 --> 00:44:09,742
... for an ideal.
They want to save the fatherland.

685
00:44:10,102 --> 00:44:12,693
They believe in what
you have been teaching, mr Stern.

686
00:44:12,771 --> 00:44:15,678
Hölderlin! "The battle is ours!"
My life for the fatherland!

687
00:44:15,923 --> 00:44:18,443
"We don't count the deads!
No sacrifice is too small!"

688
00:44:18,682 --> 00:44:21,424
Bt mr Fröhlich,
all these ideals...

689
00:44:21,622 --> 00:44:22,895
...heroism, fatherland, freedom...

690
00:44:23,062 --> 00:44:25,167
...have fallen in the hands
of criminals!

691
00:44:25,377 --> 00:44:27,156
They aren't valid anymore!

692
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:30,170
Some days ago my son died
at the front.

693
00:44:31,117 --> 00:44:32,444
What is not valid anymore?

694
00:44:33,494 --> 00:44:34,968
Forgive me.

695
00:44:36,745 --> 00:44:41,255
I don't think, that I still
can be a teacher after this war.

696
00:44:46,608 --> 00:44:48,164
Mr Fröhlich...

697
00:44:50,085 --> 00:44:52,090
The purpose of my visit was,...

698
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:56,412
...to ask you to do something
for my boys.

699
00:44:57,364 --> 00:44:58,581
How do you mean?

700
00:44:58,675 --> 00:45:01,815
Maybe you as leader of the division
can keep my boys out of this...

701
00:45:01,944 --> 00:45:02,802
Don't talk rubbish!

702
00:45:02,952 --> 00:45:04,582
I'm not even allowed
to listen to this.

703
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:07,009
I have my orders and
have to follow them.

704
00:45:08,728 --> 00:45:09,618
Captain...

705
00:45:20,256 --> 00:45:24,157
-Is it clean now?
- No, it's still dirty.

706
00:45:24,593 --> 00:45:25,720
I can't see anything.

707
00:45:25,882 --> 00:45:27,532
Hi, little one - exhausted?

708
00:45:28,518 --> 00:45:30,457
I feel so bad.
I'm at the end.

709
00:45:30,904 --> 00:45:32,997
Give me your rifle.
We'll do it for you.

710
00:45:37,309 --> 00:45:39,190
Now we should have had biology.

711
00:45:39,433 --> 00:45:41,548
Then I would feel bad, too.

712
00:45:45,090 --> 00:45:46,156
Does the bayonet need to
be cleaned, too?

713
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:47,729
After all we have to clean
our weapons...

714
00:45:47,902 --> 00:45:49,934
... or do you think it's a toothstick?

715
00:45:51,016 --> 00:45:52,341
Why isn't it sharp?

716
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:54,243
- So the hole gets bigger.
- Why?

717
00:45:54,457 --> 00:45:56,482
Obvious: if it was
sharp as a knife...

718
00:45:56,682 --> 00:45:58,218
...it would easily get in and out.

719
00:45:58,584 --> 00:46:00,568
You're finished, when you
get this in your belly.

720
00:46:00,739 --> 00:46:01,884
In the belly?

721
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,061
Where else?

722
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:06,949
Afterwards you have to put your
foot against, to get it out.

723
00:46:07,393 --> 00:46:08,389
How do you know?

724
00:46:08,473 --> 00:46:09,682
I read about it.

725
00:46:09,736 --> 00:46:12,032
That's something different
than flirting with girls, huh?

726
00:46:12,109 --> 00:46:13,379
Shut up!

727
00:46:14,176 --> 00:46:15,522
Attention!

728
00:46:20,127 --> 00:46:21,839
Group three about to
clean weapons.

729
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:25,045
Notice, Forst: when
cleaning weapons...

730
00:46:25,209 --> 00:46:26,780
...there is no "Attention",
understood?

731
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,513
- Yes sir.
- Go on.

732
00:46:35,554 --> 00:46:38,240
You're quite good at
this already.

733
00:46:38,467 --> 00:46:40,877
Learned at the premilitary
education, mr sergeant.

734
00:46:41,077 --> 00:46:42,878
Talk only when asked.

735
00:46:42,976 --> 00:46:44,161
Yes, sergeant.

736
00:46:45,244 --> 00:46:46,990
- You want to become officer, right?
- Yes.

737
00:46:47,802 --> 00:46:48,856
Your rifle.

738
00:46:50,984 --> 00:46:53,581
Keep it still.
Higher.

739
00:46:55,841 --> 00:47:00,709
You haven't learned everything
at this premilitary thing.

740
00:47:00,815 --> 00:47:02,666
- Once more.
- Yes, sergeant.

741
00:47:04,696 --> 00:47:05,599
Go ahead...!

742
00:47:10,895 --> 00:47:13,946
You think, there is
enough oil around, huh?

743
00:47:14,757 --> 00:47:18,068
Oh, oh, oh! You're wasting
public property.

744
00:47:23,431 --> 00:47:24,786
What are you doing there?

745
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:27,086
Private Siegfried cleaning
weapons, sir.

746
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:30,873
I can see, you don't steal apples
What sort of knife is this?

747
00:47:30,950 --> 00:47:34,634
It's pushed in the belly, and you
have to stem the foot against.

748
00:47:36,530 --> 00:47:38,750
Shake before use,
it said on the bottle...

749
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:41,351
...filled with poison.

750
00:47:44,706 --> 00:47:45,739
Continue!

751
00:48:04,071 --> 00:48:04,941
Alarm!

752
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:07,650
Prepare to leave!

753
00:48:08,524 --> 00:48:09,686
Alarm!

754
00:48:10,418 --> 00:48:12,367
Prepare to leave!

755
00:48:13,982 --> 00:48:15,188
Alarm!

756
00:48:15,597 --> 00:48:17,648
Prepare to leave!

757
00:48:18,465 --> 00:48:19,672
Alarm!

758
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:22,005
Prepare to leave!

759
00:48:23,438 --> 00:48:24,554
Alarm!

760
00:48:25,085 --> 00:48:26,964
Prepare to leave!

761
00:48:27,756 --> 00:48:29,080
Alarm!

762
00:48:29,376 --> 00:48:31,037
Prepare to leave!

763
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:33,813
Alarm!

764
00:48:34,007 --> 00:48:35,388
Platoon, get up!

765
00:48:35,634 --> 00:48:37,848
Hurry! Up! Move!

766
00:48:39,580 --> 00:48:40,398
Alarm!

767
00:48:40,808 --> 00:48:42,582
Prepare to leave!

768
00:48:44,766 --> 00:48:45,804
Alarm!

769
00:48:46,056 --> 00:48:47,639
Prepare to leave!

770
00:48:48,961 --> 00:48:49,906
Alarm!

771
00:48:50,596 --> 00:48:52,284
Prepare to leave!

772
00:48:53,288 --> 00:48:54,631
They don't even let us sleep.

773
00:48:55,721 --> 00:48:57,349
I can't close the buckle.

774
00:49:03,925 --> 00:49:04,657
Attention!

775
00:49:05,488 --> 00:49:07,714
- How's it going?
- All ready, sergeant.

776
00:49:07,981 --> 00:49:10,856
Get out! Hurry!
Get that buckle straight.

777
00:49:11,564 --> 00:49:12,976
- Do you have everything?
- Yes, sergeant.

778
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:16,023
- Don't forget your bucket!
- What does the sergeant mean?

779
00:49:16,318 --> 00:49:18,591
Here! Your helmet!

780
00:49:18,919 --> 00:49:20,403
What are you waiting for?
Out! Move!

781
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:23,101
Hurry people, move!

782
00:49:25,130 --> 00:49:26,409
One of them actually
forgot his bride!

783
00:49:28,165 --> 00:49:30,391
Move! Move!

784
00:50:03,549 --> 00:50:04,683
The situation is crap.

785
00:50:05,056 --> 00:50:06,265
Zimmerman! A cigar!

786
00:50:07,153 --> 00:50:09,933
We make a wedge here,
which must stand until tomorrow.

787
00:50:10,272 --> 00:50:11,725
It must hold.

788
00:50:16,228 --> 00:50:17,342
Fire anyone?

789
00:50:20,743 --> 00:50:21,484
Thanks.

790
00:50:22,029 --> 00:50:26,507
This afternoon the americans
reached this line.

791
00:50:27,239 --> 00:50:29,095
Bees, come in.
Bees, come in!

792
00:50:30,303 --> 00:50:31,572
My orders are...

793
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:34,863
...to throw everything to the front,
that can carry a rifle.

794
00:50:35,139 --> 00:50:36,946
Only the wounded stay here.

795
00:50:37,365 --> 00:50:38,639
Zimmermann, read.

796
00:50:38,716 --> 00:50:40,503
Captain Fröhlich leads the
battallion on the march.

797
00:50:40,643 --> 00:50:42,179
The bataillon follows
march-order...

798
00:50:42,342 --> 00:50:45,472
...1, 2, 4, 3, with the ambulances
and supplies at the rear.

799
00:50:45,726 --> 00:50:47,308
The defensepositions must be
reached at sunset.

800
00:50:48,091 --> 00:50:50,303
All units at...

801
00:50:50,479 --> 00:50:51,467
... 4 o'clock in the morning.

802
00:50:51,749 --> 00:50:53,131
Check the watches.

803
00:50:54,984 --> 00:50:56,702
Battallion! Attention!

804
00:50:59,357 --> 00:51:02,469
Battallion ready, lieutenant!

805
00:51:03,170 --> 00:51:05,470
Eyes right!

806
00:51:08,592 --> 00:51:10,847
Grenadierbattallion 463
reports ready.

807
00:51:11,133 --> 00:51:12,159
Thanks. At ease.

808
00:51:12,615 --> 00:51:14,779
At ease!

809
00:51:18,823 --> 00:51:19,609
Soldiers!

810
00:51:19,980 --> 00:51:24,083
Yesterday the americans
started a new offensive.

811
00:51:24,344 --> 00:51:28,788
Our battalion is from now on
part of division 336.

812
00:51:29,221 --> 00:51:30,560
We proceed tonight.

813
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:34,073
I expect from the experienced
soldier of the battalion...

814
00:51:34,401 --> 00:51:38,216
...that they
- as always- ...

815
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:39,798
...do their duty.

816
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,713
We will engage the
enemy tomorrow morning.

817
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:46,656
Every squaremeter,
which we defend,...

818
00:51:46,743 --> 00:51:49,245
... is part of the heart
of our fatherland.

819
00:51:50,194 --> 00:51:54,285
And who defends just
one squaremeter...

820
00:51:54,351 --> 00:51:56,992
...he defends Germany.

821
00:51:57,326 --> 00:52:00,611
We know, that the
situation is bloody serious.

822
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:05,249
But we are soldiers -
whether we live or die.

823
00:52:05,699 --> 00:52:06,938
History will judge,...

824
00:52:07,089 --> 00:52:09,383
... if we did our duty.

825
00:52:10,145 --> 00:52:12,468
The young soldiers on their
first mission shall know...

826
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:16,069
...that our battallion only
knows "Forward"!

827
00:52:16,181 --> 00:52:19,263
Never "Back"!

828
00:52:19,789 --> 00:52:24,448
Our battallion only knows
fight, victory or death!

829
00:52:25,767 --> 00:52:28,342
I expect, that the fatherland
in these serious times...

830
00:52:28,744 --> 00:52:30,463
...can count on you.

831
00:52:30,911 --> 00:52:33,246
The parole also for
this mission is: ...

832
00:52:34,048 --> 00:52:37,568
Forward for Führer,
people and fatherland!

833
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,906
- Let the battallion be dismissed.
- Yes, captain.

834
00:52:41,367 --> 00:52:42,265
- Zimmermann! A cigar.
- Yes, sir.

835
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:44,259
<i>Battallion dismissed!</i>

836
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:46,278
<i>Get ammunition
and supplies.</i>

837
00:52:46,602 --> 00:52:48,843
<i>First platoon...</i>

838
00:52:53,099 --> 00:52:54,700
The new report.

839
00:53:01,751 --> 00:53:03,806
Zimmermann, make sure
there's enough brandy.

840
00:53:04,140 --> 00:53:05,746
This will become a slaughterhouse.

841
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:07,453
Where's my car?
Get it!

842
00:53:07,565 --> 00:53:08,680
Yes, captain.

843
00:53:08,955 --> 00:53:09,919
What is it?

844
00:53:10,024 --> 00:53:11,617
Captain, I have 7 new
privates in my platoon.

845
00:53:11,769 --> 00:53:12,466
And?

846
00:53:12,504 --> 00:53:14,061
They are 16 - untrained.

847
00:53:14,927 --> 00:53:16,468
- Soldiers since when?
- Since this morning.

848
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,579
At the first shooting they will run
- and the platoon with them.

849
00:53:19,997 --> 00:53:21,285
Just what we need.

850
00:53:24,719 --> 00:53:27,259
Zimmermann!
Where are you?

851
00:53:27,433 --> 00:53:28,747
We have to go!

852
00:53:32,057 --> 00:53:33,764
There's this little bridge
at the entry of the town.

853
00:53:33,948 --> 00:53:34,815
It's not important anymore.

854
00:53:34,936 --> 00:53:36,981
The americans already have
a bridgehead in the north.

855
00:53:37,026 --> 00:53:38,900
And the bridge will be
blown up anyway.

856
00:53:39,033 --> 00:53:40,988
But we should secure the bridge.
The boys could do that.

857
00:53:41,026 --> 00:53:42,586
It's ok with me.
Just put them there.

858
00:53:42,741 --> 00:53:44,183
Yes, captain.

859
00:53:47,748 --> 00:53:49,573
Drive!

860
00:53:55,629 --> 00:53:58,260
- Heilmann! The lieutenant calls you.
- I'm coming.

861
00:53:58,407 --> 00:53:59,875
Sorz!

862
00:54:00,012 --> 00:54:01,154
- You are in charge.
- Yes, sir.

863
00:54:04,624 --> 00:54:07,064
- Sergeant Heilmann!
- Yes! I'm coming!

864
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:10,759
Now they make us be cannonfodder
five minutes to twelve.

865
00:54:10,953 --> 00:54:11,861
They don't care.

866
00:54:13,025 --> 00:54:13,942
Let me get through.

867
00:54:16,192 --> 00:54:17,985
No contact with the enemy!
No shootings.

868
00:54:18,149 --> 00:54:19,727
- Understood?
- Yes, sir.

869
00:54:19,826 --> 00:54:21,686
How long have you been soldier?

870
00:54:23,073 --> 00:54:24,138
7 years, sir.

871
00:54:24,214 --> 00:54:27,183
And what did you learn
during those 7 years?

872
00:54:27,412 --> 00:54:28,707
Not to be noticed.

873
00:54:28,804 --> 00:54:30,262
That's exactly what I
expect, Heilmann.

874
00:54:30,391 --> 00:54:32,866
The bridge isn't important.
It will be blown up.

875
00:54:32,954 --> 00:54:36,301
- No meaningless casualties!
- Yes.

876
00:54:37,422 --> 00:54:38,287
Thank you.

877
00:54:41,756 --> 00:54:43,123
Here we have order!

878
00:54:43,513 --> 00:54:45,604
- Wait! You're only allowed one can!
- What?

879
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:48,518
- Put one can back!
- I beg your pardon?

880
00:54:48,893 --> 00:54:51,117
Here they count everything -
all into the massgraves

881
00:54:51,474 --> 00:54:54,040
Then keep your damned cans!

882
00:54:55,180 --> 00:54:56,748
What on...
Pick them up immidiately!

883
00:54:56,999 --> 00:54:59,976
You only have a big mouth,
because you're in uniform!

884
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,481
Shut up or you'll
regret it.

885
00:55:01,716 --> 00:55:03,304
Trust me in this:

886
00:55:03,496 --> 00:55:04,502
I'll survive until the end,...

887
00:55:04,714 --> 00:55:07,817
...just to pay you back!
- I will report you.

888
00:55:08,128 --> 00:55:10,946
If you live long enough!
Coward!

889
00:55:11,545 --> 00:55:13,391
- Verbitsky!
- What?

890
00:55:13,437 --> 00:55:15,496
- Don't delay anything.
- Yes.

891
00:55:17,379 --> 00:55:19,545
- Don't be stupid! Move.
- Yes, sir.

892
00:55:24,069 --> 00:55:26,930
I couldn't know, that this
is a kindergarten.

893
00:55:27,385 --> 00:55:29,588
Hurry and get your weapons...

894
00:55:29,692 --> 00:55:31,013
...and go outside.
Get going.

895
00:55:40,861 --> 00:55:43,748
Get up.

896
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,345
Close the hatch.

897
00:56:06,659 --> 00:56:08,758
Heilmann, here.

898
00:56:34,594 --> 00:56:36,335
Sergent Heilmann!
Get your people off.

899
00:56:39,671 --> 00:56:41,801
- Group 3, off the truck!
- We don't go further?

900
00:56:42,087 --> 00:56:44,163
The rest of the group
goes on.

901
00:56:44,142 --> 00:56:45,506
Are we already at the front?

902
00:56:45,988 --> 00:56:46,889
Rubbish.

903
00:56:49,084 --> 00:56:51,409
But...
but this is our bridge!

904
00:56:51,456 --> 00:56:52,810
What are we doing here?

905
00:56:53,027 --> 00:56:53,952
Be glad, you idiots!

906
00:56:54,131 --> 00:56:56,399
Would you rather be there,
where shit really is boiling?

907
00:56:57,346 --> 00:56:58,619
What a theater!

908
00:57:04,671 --> 00:57:06,702
Those from "Volkssturm" seem
to have gone home already.

909
00:57:06,841 --> 00:57:08,907
Even better. Like this they
can't wreck anything.

910
00:57:09,359 --> 00:57:11,110
Keep them busy.

911
00:57:11,278 --> 00:57:12,514
In the meantime make sure,...

912
00:57:12,619 --> 00:57:14,629
... that the demolition command
arrives in time.

913
00:57:14,839 --> 00:57:17,036
The bridge needs to explode
in the right moment.

914
00:57:17,344 --> 00:57:18,189
Understood.

915
00:57:18,373 --> 00:57:20,027
- I trust you, Heilmann.
- Yes, sir.

916
00:57:33,784 --> 00:57:36,003
- Stupid carrying!
- It's not fun anymore.

917
00:57:36,241 --> 00:57:38,866
Stop complaining and bring
the gear over here.

918
00:57:39,074 --> 00:57:41,365
Do you think,
we're safe here tonight?

919
00:57:41,662 --> 00:57:43,242
Tonight something will
happen everywhere.

920
00:57:45,890 --> 00:57:47,452
Soon the dragging is over.

921
00:57:47,713 --> 00:57:49,380
Then we'll have a nice time, ok?

922
00:57:50,182 --> 00:57:51,948
They put us off far away
from the front.

923
00:57:52,233 --> 00:57:54,233
The backseats are the best -
like in the cinema.

924
00:57:54,351 --> 00:57:56,200
In the frontseats it's flickering.

925
00:57:56,546 --> 00:57:57,984
Let's put the gear here.

926
00:57:59,086 --> 00:58:01,016
Put the tank fists
over there.

927
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,586
Position of the first
machinegun?

928
00:58:04,466 --> 00:58:06,584
At the right side of the road.

929
00:58:06,785 --> 00:58:07,794
And the second?

930
00:58:08,001 --> 00:58:09,323
Here at the left.

931
00:58:10,284 --> 00:58:12,586
We know the bridge. We know
good shooting positions.

932
00:58:13,456 --> 00:58:15,545
You played indians here, right?

933
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:17,794
Yes. Up there is our
recognition post.

934
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:20,553
Can't I take position there?

935
00:58:22,328 --> 00:58:24,523
Ok, climb up and keep
an eye on everything.

936
00:58:24,874 --> 00:58:25,797
Yes, sergeant.

937
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:28,574
Assemble the machinegun,
I said. Get going.

938
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,913
I go forth with this,
sergeant.

939
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:40,434
No, stay here.

940
00:58:40,982 --> 00:58:42,170
And don't play around with it.

941
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:45,252
Better go over there
and help them dig.

942
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:46,694
And what can I do?

943
00:58:48,373 --> 00:58:50,323
You go on the bridge and
keep guard, understood?

944
00:58:50,505 --> 00:58:52,603
- Yes, sir.
- And don't abandon your post.

945
00:58:52,959 --> 00:58:54,681
Keeping guard is the most
important thing in war.

946
00:58:55,018 --> 00:58:56,833
- Yes, sir.
- Now go.

947
00:59:06,296 --> 00:59:07,587
And what are you doing?

948
00:59:08,386 --> 00:59:10,172
I need ammunition on the tree.

949
00:59:10,393 --> 00:59:11,978
What a luck, that we don't
have a cannon also.

950
00:59:12,141 --> 00:59:13,664
You would drag it up, too,
right?

951
00:59:15,222 --> 00:59:17,039
- Isn't it deep enough now?
- Don't be silly.

952
00:59:17,432 --> 00:59:18,881
When they come, they can
still shoot in here.

953
00:59:19,220 --> 00:59:20,850
In this fog they can't
see us anyway.

954
00:59:21,076 --> 00:59:22,215
And when the fog disappears?

955
00:59:31,857 --> 00:59:32,994
Third group, attention!

956
00:59:38,504 --> 00:59:39,519
Listen...

957
00:59:39,864 --> 00:59:42,665
When it gets light, you'd
probably like some coffee, right?

958
00:59:42,988 --> 00:59:45,080
- Yes, sergeant.
- I'll go and organize some.

959
00:59:45,929 --> 00:59:47,714
In the meantime the
command is at...

960
00:59:50,509 --> 00:59:51,968
-... Scholten!
- Understood.

961
00:59:52,113 --> 00:59:53,724
- Yes, sergeant.

962
00:59:56,821 --> 00:59:59,577
- Take my rifle.
- Yes, sir.

963
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:00,932
And carry on.

964
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:08,381
What a guy!

965
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:09,942
Why? He's nice.

966
01:00:10,331 --> 01:00:12,602
Rubbish. A good soldier doesn't
leave his rifle behind.

967
01:00:26,013 --> 01:00:28,428
- Excuse me, do you have fire?
- Yes.

968
01:00:28,753 --> 01:00:30,633
- Cigarette?
- Yes, thanks.

969
01:00:32,499 --> 01:00:35,892
Hide.

970
01:00:39,419 --> 01:00:43,128
- Stop! What did he want?
- Why?

971
01:00:43,949 --> 01:00:45,873
- What did he say?
- Err...

972
01:00:45,781 --> 01:00:47,967
Move on! Quickly!

973
01:00:53,334 --> 01:00:56,904
Stop!
What are you doing here?

974
01:00:56,828 --> 01:00:59,729
- Me?
- Yes, you. Where are your orders?

975
01:01:00,054 --> 01:01:02,200
- I don't have them with me.
- What unit do you belong to?

976
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:05,258
Sergeant Heilmann. 463. battalion,
3. platoon.

977
01:01:05,854 --> 01:01:08,015
- And what are you doing here?
- I...

978
01:01:08,153 --> 01:01:09,403
Your reportbook!

979
01:01:11,609 --> 01:01:14,273
Here. I'm securing the bridge.

980
01:01:14,909 --> 01:01:17,656
Rubbish! That bridge doesn't
need to be secured.

981
01:01:17,991 --> 01:01:18,964
It will be blown up.

982
01:01:19,325 --> 01:01:22,443
- No stories! You're a deserter!
- What do you mean? Deserter?

983
01:01:22,789 --> 01:01:25,431
Follow to the office!
There you'll see, what will happen.

984
01:01:25,675 --> 01:01:29,228
But I have my group at the bridge.
I can't leave them.

985
01:01:29,538 --> 01:01:31,151
Don't talk! Follow me!

986
01:01:31,228 --> 01:01:33,261
They are still kids! They've been
soldiers for only one day.

987
01:01:33,394 --> 01:01:35,171
My orders are to take
care of them.

988
01:01:35,179 --> 01:01:36,409
Then why do you walk around
here at night?

989
01:01:36,539 --> 01:01:38,592
But I'm on duty!

990
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,608
Everyone can say that.

991
01:01:39,648 --> 01:01:42,008
You idiot!
Don't be so stubborn!

992
01:01:42,344 --> 01:01:44,037
Come to the bridge and
have a look yourself!

993
01:01:44,293 --> 01:01:47,013
To send kids in the war and
then abandoning them! It's insane!

994
01:01:47,216 --> 01:01:48,154
It's...

995
01:01:48,889 --> 01:01:51,215
Take that stupid thing away!

996
01:01:52,939 --> 01:01:54,708
Stop! Stay here!

997
01:02:13,147 --> 01:02:15,200
What was that?

998
01:02:17,057 --> 01:02:18,339
It was shots...

999
01:02:21,899 --> 01:02:23,627
Can you see something up there?

1000
01:02:24,025 --> 01:02:25,089
No. Nothing.

1001
01:02:30,613 --> 01:02:31,789
Just come down then.

1002
01:02:35,331 --> 01:02:37,258
With this weather
war should be prohibited.

1003
01:02:39,728 --> 01:02:41,254
When will Heilmann be back?

1004
01:02:41,441 --> 01:02:42,950
He'll come.

1005
01:02:48,516 --> 01:02:50,284
- I'll have a look.
- You stay here.

1006
01:02:50,937 --> 01:02:52,548
Yes, sergeant.

1007
01:02:59,638 --> 01:03:01,833
If only Heilmann doesn't
leave us in the lurch.

1008
01:03:02,091 --> 01:03:02,967
Not him!

1009
01:03:04,655 --> 01:03:06,902
A lot better persons than him
have deserted.

1010
01:03:07,673 --> 01:03:09,943
You have too much imagination.

1011
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:20,871
Did you hear that?

1012
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,781
Just some fish...

1013
01:03:24,766 --> 01:03:28,666
Now we have 10 rolls already.
We'll never need so many.

1014
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:41,816
Listen!

1015
01:03:44,748 --> 01:03:48,669
Artillery. But far away.

1016
01:03:49,282 --> 01:03:51,478
- Everything ok over there?
- Yes.

1017
01:03:52,917 --> 01:03:53,975
Then come.

1018
01:04:13,991 --> 01:04:15,985
Walter, can I borrow your torch?

1019
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:17,663
Are you afraid in the dark?

1020
01:05:17,114 --> 01:05:19,441
Can't we eat soon?

1021
01:05:19,953 --> 01:05:22,946
- Yes!
- Then let's eat.

1022
01:05:27,765 --> 01:05:29,651
Cut some slices.

1023
01:05:31,747 --> 01:05:33,356
And Heilmann had promised
coffee.

1024
01:05:33,899 --> 01:05:35,564
He left us in the lurch.

1025
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:37,765
- Rubbish.
- Can't we talk about something else?

1026
01:05:38,829 --> 01:05:40,875
Sigi, why didn't you send
the sergeant to your mother?

1027
01:05:41,164 --> 01:05:42,330
She makes the best coffee.

1028
01:05:42,595 --> 01:05:45,403
I can'tt ell the sergeant
what to do.

1029
01:05:46,553 --> 01:05:48,381
Don't you have your own?

1030
01:05:48,449 --> 01:05:50,237
Don't make such a scene.

1031
01:05:52,977 --> 01:05:54,963
If my mum knew,
that we are here...

1032
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:58,297
This sausage is fabulous.

1033
01:05:58,379 --> 01:05:59,367
Here, for Sigi.

1034
01:06:00,357 --> 01:06:02,527
- Here, Sigi.
- Can I eat when on guard?

1035
01:06:02,672 --> 01:06:04,225
You have to. You're
still growing.

1036
01:06:09,550 --> 01:06:11,117
Aren't you hungry, Karl?

1037
01:06:11,305 --> 01:06:12,830
No, thanks.

1038
01:06:15,628 --> 01:06:17,234
Not such a bad place.

1039
01:06:17,644 --> 01:06:19,293
We're just missing
something decent to drink.

1040
01:06:19,445 --> 01:06:20,853
We should have some brandy.

1041
01:06:22,788 --> 01:06:23,961
There the sergeant comes.

1042
01:06:27,191 --> 01:06:30,568
No way. He left over there
and comes back here?

1043
01:06:42,436 --> 01:06:43,881
What are you doing here?

1044
01:06:46,805 --> 01:06:47,749
Having breakfast.

1045
01:06:51,855 --> 01:06:52,858
Want some liver pate?

1046
01:06:53,234 --> 01:06:55,182
Do you plan to start
a shooting here?

1047
01:06:55,363 --> 01:06:56,503
We have our orders.

1048
01:06:56,909 --> 01:06:58,466
This bridge is
strategically important.

1049
01:06:59,410 --> 01:07:01,621
- Boys, you better go home.
- What?

1050
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:02,692
Are you insane?

1051
01:07:02,930 --> 01:07:04,532
But what you do here,
is foolish.

1052
01:07:04,877 --> 01:07:06,464
The whole town will be destroyed.
I know it.

1053
01:07:06,893 --> 01:07:08,824
I've been through it,
before I got evacuated.

1054
01:07:09,308 --> 01:07:10,479
Go home.

1055
01:07:11,401 --> 01:07:13,557
You want to persuade
us to desert!

1056
01:07:13,762 --> 01:07:15,381
Bad nerves, huh?

1057
01:07:15,421 --> 01:07:18,315
We're at war, understand?
And we have to secure the bridge.

1058
01:07:18,389 --> 01:07:20,116
You have no idea,
what you are doing!

1059
01:07:20,334 --> 01:07:21,965
You just want to play heroes.

1060
01:07:23,815 --> 01:07:25,332
Move! Go away!

1061
01:07:26,084 --> 01:07:27,335
Don't do anything unreasonable.

1062
01:07:27,669 --> 01:07:29,073
Away! Now!

1063
01:07:32,041 --> 01:07:33,726
You don't know,
what you're doing.

1064
01:07:37,757 --> 01:07:39,729
Look, fast as a rabbit.

1065
01:07:43,374 --> 01:07:44,181
How fast he can run!

1066
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:46,461
What a coward!

1067
01:07:47,414 --> 01:07:50,001
He runs like a girl.

1068
01:07:56,166 --> 01:07:59,826
Maybe he's right. We don't
know, what he's been through.

1069
01:08:02,073 --> 01:08:03,178
Me too!

1070
01:08:04,697 --> 01:08:06,513
Stop fooling around.

1071
01:08:06,690 --> 01:08:09,006
Stop acting like
you're in charge.

1072
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:11,223
Who hits them first?

1073
01:08:17,885 --> 01:08:19,432
- Listen!
- What is it?

1074
01:08:20,550 --> 01:08:23,121
- A truck!
- Quicklt! Pull the barricades out!

1075
01:08:29,204 --> 01:08:30,557
What's going on?
What are you doing?

1076
01:08:38,638 --> 01:08:40,111
Hurry! Take positions!

1077
01:08:41,295 --> 01:08:42,938
Damn it!
What's going on here?

1078
01:08:43,295 --> 01:08:45,059
What idiots are blocking the bridge?

1079
01:08:47,864 --> 01:08:48,919
Are you insane!

1080
01:08:49,302 --> 01:08:50,326
Open the road!

1081
01:08:50,674 --> 01:08:51,582
Get moving!

1082
01:08:51,942 --> 01:08:53,068
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir.

1083
01:08:53,271 --> 01:08:55,449
Get down and help them.
Move.

1084
01:08:55,707 --> 01:08:57,079
It's unbelievable.

1085
01:08:57,242 --> 01:08:59,179
- What happened?
- Don't ask stupid questions.

1086
01:08:59,422 --> 01:09:01,087
Move that away.

1087
01:09:01,447 --> 01:09:03,423
Let's drive now.
Quickly.

1088
01:09:25,133 --> 01:09:26,770
We pull the barricades
back on the road again.

1089
01:09:26,932 --> 01:09:29,574
No, not yet. There will
come more trucks, he said.

1090
01:09:35,208 --> 01:09:37,188
I think, we should wait.

1091
01:09:37,793 --> 01:09:38,769
I go back to my post.

1092
01:09:59,249 --> 01:10:00,286
What happened, Helmer?

1093
01:10:03,716 --> 01:10:05,343
It's finished, lieutenant.

1094
01:10:05,479 --> 01:10:07,111
It's dead.
We have to walk.

1095
01:10:07,406 --> 01:10:10,322
Damn. Get your stuff.
We're changing vehicles.

1096
01:10:10,621 --> 01:10:13,324
Quickly. 
We have to get out of here.

1097
01:10:13,437 --> 01:10:14,815
Look! He has a...

1098
01:10:16,304 --> 01:10:17,005
Watch out!

1099
01:10:23,657 --> 01:10:24,887
Bloody pigs.

1100
01:10:26,016 --> 01:10:27,730
Get your rifles out!
The next who doesn't stop...

1101
01:10:27,997 --> 01:10:29,607
...will get a bullet in his head.

1102
01:10:30,502 --> 01:10:31,886
Come on, what are you waiting for?

1103
01:10:32,273 --> 01:10:33,755
Leave it behind. Or throw
it in the water.

1104
01:10:34,043 --> 01:10:36,719
- But...
- Leave it behind!

1105
01:10:38,036 --> 01:10:40,290
Hurry now!
We have to get out of here.

1106
01:10:50,812 --> 01:10:52,587
There's no more room.

1107
01:10:53,296 --> 01:10:55,131
Drive!
Do you all want to die here?

1108
01:11:05,921 --> 01:11:08,020
- When do we drive?
- I don't know either.

1109
01:11:08,916 --> 01:11:11,627
Why do we stop in the
middle of a bridge?

1110
01:11:12,535 --> 01:11:14,184
- We want to go home.
- Hurry a little!

1111
01:11:14,479 --> 01:11:16,455
Don't be impatient.
I do what I can.

1112
01:11:18,192 --> 01:11:21,204
It's getting light already.
We have to go.

1113
01:11:24,634 --> 01:11:26,065
Wilhelm, look at those kids.

1114
01:11:30,218 --> 01:11:30,882
Here, little fellow,...

1115
01:11:31,070 --> 01:11:33,927
Have some chocolate,
before you get pickled.

1116
01:11:39,187 --> 01:11:40,863
Come on, drive.

1117
01:12:30,188 --> 01:12:32,225
What did he mean
"getting pickled"?

1118
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:37,354
He wanted else to give
you some pickles.

1119
01:12:38,502 --> 01:12:40,516
Be happy, that you
got some chocolate.

1120
01:12:40,669 --> 01:12:41,927
What a coward -
the one with the Iron Cross.

1121
01:12:42,094 --> 01:12:43,144
He was deserting?

1122
01:12:44,327 --> 01:12:45,522
He was very busy, for sure.

1123
01:12:45,965 --> 01:12:49,108
He simply ran away!
They should all be shot.

1124
01:13:00,370 --> 01:13:02,337
Now there's noone left
between us and them!

1125
01:13:03,223 --> 01:13:05,163
- You want to go home maybe?
- Of course not.

1126
01:13:05,830 --> 01:13:09,048
- If everyone is running, it's maybe the best.
- What?

1127
01:13:11,089 --> 01:13:13,410
- Best to go home.
- Are you insane?

1128
01:13:13,594 --> 01:13:14,583
What do you mean?

1129
01:13:14,623 --> 01:13:16,752
We are soldiers, and it's
our order...

1130
01:13:16,841 --> 01:13:18,211
...to secure the bridge!

1131
01:13:18,292 --> 01:13:19,195
We won't win the war,...

1132
01:13:19,262 --> 01:13:21,544
... because we defend
this bridge, Jürgen!

1133
01:13:21,726 --> 01:13:23,353
But with every
squaremeter of land,...

1134
01:13:22,496 --> 01:13:24,775
... we defend Germany!

1135
01:13:24,812 --> 01:13:27,406
Who wants to throw the
weapons and go home?

1136
01:13:28,217 --> 01:13:30,640
- You?
- Why me?

1137
01:13:31,447 --> 01:13:32,886
- And you two?
- No.

1138
01:13:34,984 --> 01:13:36,499
I stay.

1139
01:13:37,691 --> 01:13:40,039
- And you?
- You think, I leave you alone?

1140
01:13:41,619 --> 01:13:43,317
- And you?
- I'm not a coward.

1141
01:13:45,411 --> 01:13:48,173
And you? Are you a coward?

1142
01:13:50,418 --> 01:13:51,808
I stay.

1143
01:13:53,145 --> 01:13:55,950
Great! Well, everyone
on their posts.

1144
01:13:56,569 --> 01:13:58,148
I go over there with my
tank fist.

1145
01:13:58,569 --> 01:14:01,075
Watch out! Airplanes! Down!
Down!

1146
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:06,814
It's still some kilometers away.

1147
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:09,146
They're first dangerous, when
they come right towards you.

1148
01:14:09,365 --> 01:14:10,622
See him!

1149
01:14:11,956 --> 01:14:13,258
Flat like a stamp!

1150
01:14:13,517 --> 01:14:15,105
You want to lie there,
until the war is over?

1151
01:14:15,533 --> 01:14:17,755
Have you peed in your pants?

1152
01:14:20,151 --> 01:14:21,366
Our brave Sigi!

1153
01:14:21,470 --> 01:14:24,520
What will mummy say,
if she sees you like this?

1154
01:14:24,664 --> 01:14:25,969
Watch out, ity's coming back!

1155
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:34,083
Down!

1156
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:06,043
Come on, get up!
It's safe now, Sigi!

1157
01:15:06,458 --> 01:15:13,234
Sigi! Sigi...
Sigi...

1158
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,102
Come here!
Damn it!

1159
01:15:16,665 --> 01:15:19,008
Come here!
Those swine killed him!

1160
01:15:20,588 --> 01:15:23,640
Sigi is dead!
Come here!

1161
01:15:24,088 --> 01:15:26,774
Come here, bloody hell!

1162
01:15:29,965 --> 01:15:30,628
What happened?

1163
01:15:42,651 --> 01:15:43,451
Those criminals...

1164
01:15:45,129 --> 01:15:45,942
What do we do now?

1165
01:15:47,431 --> 01:15:49,227
We have to tell his mother...

1166
01:15:53,901 --> 01:15:56,831
Poor Sigi.
I'll show them!

1167
01:15:59,058 --> 01:16:00,390
Hey, help me.

1168
01:16:02,190 --> 01:16:03,086
What sound is that?

1169
01:16:07,438 --> 01:16:08,494
It's tanks!

1170
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,406
Hurry!

1171
01:16:22,914 --> 01:16:24,036
The barricades on the road!

1172
01:16:48,201 --> 01:16:51,124
Bloody tanks!
Back!

1173
01:16:52,082 --> 01:16:53,975
We let the tanks pass
and blow it up later!

1174
01:17:00,874 --> 01:17:02,339
Into the basement there!

1175
01:20:29,417 --> 01:20:31,998
Walter has hit a tank!

1176
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,965
Shoot now!

1177
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:21,388
Get the boxes
with ammunition!

1178
01:21:26,919 --> 01:21:29,013
Damn! Something's stuck! 
Help me.

1179
01:22:04,560 --> 01:22:05,668
Walter is crazy!

1180
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:09,985
Cover him!

1181
01:22:18,911 --> 01:22:20,186
Are you crazy?
Cover!

1182
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:25,871
Those bloody kids will
have us all killed!

1183
01:23:26,606 --> 01:23:27,506
What a bunch of idiots.

1184
01:23:27,765 --> 01:23:29,524
If they had let the
americans pass,...

1185
01:23:29,717 --> 01:23:30,953
...we would have had blown up
the bridge already!

1186
01:23:31,354 --> 01:23:32,869
Oh God, how shall this end?

1187
01:23:33,052 --> 01:23:35,925
This is nothing.
The real fireworks is at the front.

1188
01:23:36,706 --> 01:23:39,966
My son is soldier, too.
They drafted him yesterday!

1189
01:23:40,428 --> 01:23:42,148
You think, he's at
the front already?

1190
01:23:42,602 --> 01:23:43,685
Yesterday?

1191
01:23:45,073 --> 01:23:46,842
The he can't even hold
a rifle yet.

1192
01:23:46,972 --> 01:23:48,720
What should he do at the front?

1193
01:24:49,317 --> 01:24:51,059
Now show, how brave you are.

1194
01:24:52,751 --> 01:24:54,260
You're not going to
break down now, are you?

1195
01:24:55,790 --> 01:24:58,325
I don't want to die!
I don't want to die!

1196
01:24:58,488 --> 01:25:00,439
Are you only tough
in front of girls?

1197
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:14,077
I want to go! I want to go!
I want out of here!

1198
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:44,809
- Jürgen! Jürgen!
- Stay here!

1199
01:26:45,026 --> 01:26:46,867
- Jürgen!
- Stay here!

1200
01:27:24,140 --> 01:27:26,166
What are you doing?
Are you insane?

1201
01:27:26,372 --> 01:27:27,556
There are americans up there.

1202
01:27:27,794 --> 01:27:28,893
And there are women and 
children in the basement.

1203
01:27:29,022 --> 01:27:30,379
If you don't leave, I'll scream.

1204
01:27:30,496 --> 01:27:31,462
Go away.

1205
01:28:05,885 --> 01:28:08,212
Don't be stupid!
Don't shoot!

1206
01:28:25,452 --> 01:28:27,066
"Bloody kid!
What did you do that for?"

1207
01:29:22,557 --> 01:29:24,804
- There's another one! Watch out!
- Shoot him!

1208
01:29:26,572 --> 01:29:28,715
"Hey, hey! You!
Let's not shoot!"

1209
01:29:28,925 --> 01:29:31,538
- "Come on, give up."
- What's he shouting?

1210
01:29:31,936 --> 01:29:33,956
"We don't fight kids!"

1211
01:29:34,581 --> 01:29:36,896
"Go home! Go to your
kindergarten."

1212
01:29:37,994 --> 01:29:40,534
"Go! Go home!
To the kindergarten."

1213
01:29:41,905 --> 01:29:43,919
Kindergarten? I'll show you!

1214
01:29:44,302 --> 01:29:45,137
Karl!

1215
01:29:58,741 --> 01:30:01,142
Karl! Karl, shoot!

1216
01:30:01,764 --> 01:30:04,338
Kill him, Karl! Shoot!

1217
01:30:04,916 --> 01:30:06,716
Shoot! Finish him, Karl!

1218
01:30:07,420 --> 01:30:08,720
Finish him.

1219
01:30:11,056 --> 01:30:12,704
Karl! Karl!

1220
01:30:16,614 --> 01:30:19,095
Karl, Karl shoot! Karl shoot!

1221
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:25,496
Karl, Karl ...Karl...

1222
01:30:26,851 --> 01:30:27,762
Karl...

1223
01:30:27,926 --> 01:30:29,025
Karl...

1224
01:30:32,732 --> 01:30:33,662
Karl...

1225
01:30:37,060 --> 01:30:40,470
Karl ...I didn't mean to hit you!

1226
01:30:40,986 --> 01:30:43,906
It was only because 
of Franziska, Karl.

1227
01:30:44,305 --> 01:30:45,623
Hit me now, Karl!

1228
01:30:46,072 --> 01:30:47,288
Karl, hit me!

1229
01:30:47,498 --> 01:30:49,259
Hit back, Karl! Help!

1230
01:30:49,593 --> 01:30:51,761
Help! Help!

1231
01:30:52,358 --> 01:30:54,108
I have to go to him!
They're killing him!

1232
01:30:54,176 --> 01:30:55,351
Help...

1233
01:30:58,209 --> 01:31:00,767
Help... help...

1234
01:31:02,534 --> 01:31:03,489
Get down!

1235
01:31:05,732 --> 01:31:08,639
I killed him, Hans.
I killed him!

1236
01:31:10,591 --> 01:31:12,245
I killed him...

1237
01:31:15,824 --> 01:31:16,679
Come, Karl...

1238
01:31:17,405 --> 01:31:20,574
Karl ...Karl ...Karl ...Karl...

1239
01:31:20,797 --> 01:31:21,964
Come with me, Karl...

1240
01:31:22,366 --> 01:31:23,879
Karl ...

1241
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:25,951
Come... Karl...

1242
01:31:26,560 --> 01:31:28,018
Karl ...Karl...

1243
01:31:29,637 --> 01:31:30,750
Klaus, cover!

1244
01:31:31,013 --> 01:31:32,951
I killed him, Hans!
I killed him.

1245
01:31:33,422 --> 01:31:34,800
I killed him!

1246
01:31:34,985 --> 01:31:36,239
Stop it!

1247
01:31:36,378 --> 01:31:38,726
Leave me alone!
Let me be!

1248
01:31:38,925 --> 01:31:41,380
Calm down, Klaus!

1249
01:31:41,559 --> 01:31:43,578
Karl! Karl!

1250
01:33:25,645 --> 01:33:26,926
They are gone.

1251
01:33:28,603 --> 01:33:30,575
- Albert!
- It's not so bad.

1252
01:33:30,852 --> 01:33:33,048
Take the jacket off.
I put a bandage on it.

1253
01:33:36,961 --> 01:33:38,005
I'll help you.

1254
01:33:44,185 --> 01:33:46,983
- They'll fetch reinforcement.
- You think?

1255
01:33:49,213 --> 01:33:50,781
We have to get away.

1256
01:33:59,469 --> 01:34:00,586
Walter!

1257
01:34:03,968 --> 01:34:05,768
Walter!

1258
01:34:09,574 --> 01:34:10,651
Come.

1259
01:34:25,463 --> 01:34:27,360
The dynamite and fuses.

1260
01:34:41,809 --> 01:34:43,346
Put the boxes there.

1261
01:34:46,109 --> 01:34:49,200
Use a lot.
It's a massive bridge.

1262
01:34:49,377 --> 01:34:51,130
Yes, sergeant.

1263
01:34:57,657 --> 01:35:00,533
- What are you doing here?
- We blow up all this mess.

1264
01:35:01,221 --> 01:35:03,581
What a circus you've made here!

1265
01:35:03,682 --> 01:35:04,982
How many have died?

1266
01:35:06,033 --> 01:35:08,345
And now you expect a
medal around your neck, huh?

1267
01:35:08,654 --> 01:35:12,025
Well, go home to mum
and get celebrated!

1268
01:35:12,899 --> 01:35:15,500
This is not true!
This is not true!

1269
01:35:15,942 --> 01:35:18,121
- This is not true!
- You're some nice heroes!

1270
01:35:18,366 --> 01:35:19,890
Be quiet! Shut up!

1271
01:35:20,353 --> 01:35:22,528
Shut up!
It's not true!

1272
01:35:23,448 --> 01:35:27,002
- Get lost! Go away!
- Take it easy, my boy.

1273
01:35:27,766 --> 01:35:31,691
Take your rifle away. Don't be stupid.
We have our orders.

1274
01:35:34,795 --> 01:35:38,048
Move!
Get off the bridge - now!

1275
01:35:42,382 --> 01:35:45,390
I had to do it...
I had to do it!

1276
01:35:51,438 --> 01:35:53,190
Pigs!
Criminals!

1277
01:35:54,211 --> 01:35:57,889
Away! Get lost!

1278
01:35:58,473 --> 01:36:02,143
Get lost! Away with you!

1279
01:36:07,590 --> 01:36:09,637
Hans! Hans! What's up?

1280
01:36:10,161 --> 01:36:12,298
Answer, Hans! Hans!

1281
01:36:14,823 --> 01:36:17,225
Come. I'll take you home.

1282
01:36:17,704 --> 01:36:20,572
Hans, come on. I beg you.

1283
01:36:22,616 --> 01:36:23,702
Hans...

1284
01:36:27,317 --> 01:36:28,393
Hans, come...

1285
01:36:29,501 --> 01:36:31,136
Come with me, Hans...

1286
01:36:34,656 --> 01:36:39,406
Hans ... Come... Hans...

1287
01:36:41,054 --> 01:36:43,108
Hans, Hans!

1288
01:36:45,901 --> 01:36:47,706
Kom, Hans... come...

1289
01:36:50,083 --> 01:36:52,809
Hans, come...

1290
01:37:15,931 --> 01:37:18,197
This happened on april 27th, 1945.

1291
01:37:18,246 --> 01:37:21,356
It was so insignificant,
That it was not mentioned...

1292
01:37:21,571 --> 01:37:23,853
...in any military report.

1293
01:37:26,171 --> 01:37:29,427
THE BRIDGE
