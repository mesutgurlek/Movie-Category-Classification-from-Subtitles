- There's nothing for you to do.
- Isn't there?

- Wait. If you...
- I'm in a hurry.

- Hi, honey.

Lieutenant Billings.
You two are going to work together.

- How do you do, Captain? I was just...

71
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,646

a mutual friend, Alex Brissac.

00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:57,410
- How nice.
- Why, sure. I remember him.

73
00:06:57,483 --> 00:07:00,884

previous missions with Captain Rochard...

74
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:04,320
he just returned some of my things...
perhaps I can be of some help to you.

75
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:08,326
Thank you. I can explain things to Lieutenant
Billings. Don't you have somewhere to go?

76
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,022
- Oh, no. I'm free until 2:30.
- Well, about this here mission...

77
00:07:11,097 --> 00:07:13,088
It's a simple matter.
It's an overnight job.

78
00:07:13,166 --> 00:07:15,760
We have to go to Bad Nauheim,
a pleasant little village, and...

79
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,803
- Or it will be till you get there.
- Oh.

80
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,464
Well, I can explain the whole thing
better to you when we're alone.

81
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:24,499
Better wear side arms, Lieutenant.
He uses maps instead of etchings.

82
00:07:24,577 --> 00:07:27,740
Captain Rochard, I've so looked forward
to going to Bad Nauheim.

83
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:31,682
Billings, the French army shoe is
built on slightly different lines. It...

84
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:34,049
- Ooh.
- Hold the foot, would you, Junior?

85
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,819
- Yes, yes, yes.
- As you can see by Captain Rochard's
foot and my thigh.

86
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:41,553
- For goodness sakes!
- That was purely accidental.

87
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:45,256
- The mark on my chin... May I have my foot?
- Mmm.

88
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,630
Thank you. The mark
under my chin was an accident.

89
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:52,068
- My fault entirely. I tripped
while he was chasing me.
- Chasing you?

90
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,299
- Will you shut up?
- There. You see?

91
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,240
Something I would never have mentioned
if he hadn't shown it. His temper.

92
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,575
But the poor man's probably not to blame.
More like a form of epilepsy.

93
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:02,910
- Will you shut up!
- I tell you this...

94
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:04,916
Will you shh... shh...

95
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:07,145

96
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,154
Yes, you are.

97
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:12,749
I tell you this because we're members
of the same army and the same sex.

98
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:16,386
I think it only fair to warn you Jack the Ripper's
up that alley before you head into it.

99

102
00:08:23,936 --> 00:08:27,235
- You're not?
- I'm goin' to Frankfurt with
Colonel Bliven on that D.P. Job.

- And you're goin' with him.

Come in, please. You too, Captain.

This shouldn't take long, Captain. Gates,
Billings is needed on another assignment.

- You'll have to take her place
along with Captain Rochard.
- Thank you, no.

But, Major, if I may suggest, Lieutenant Perry
is almost finished with her assignment.

No. No experience. And Captain Rochard
wants our best, don't you, Captain?

114
00:09:02,742 --> 00:09:06,303
Well, uh, Major. You see,
this is not an important mission.

115
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:09,507
My government's request for an officer
is only a technicality, so that...

116
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:13,313
Your orders call for our full cooperation.
It's my job to see you get it.

- Your orders are being cut, Gates.

119

- Captain Rochard will brief you
on the mission.
- Yes, Major.

120
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:26,255
Well, Major, this Lieutenant
What's-her-name... Perry, she ought to do.

121
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:29,631
Oh, you're very kind, Captain,
but we're used to being shorthanded.

122
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:34,730
Besides, if I remember, you've had several
assignments with Lieutenant Gates before...

123
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:37,173
and very successfully, apparently.

124

- Wish she were.

- What was that you said, Captain?
- Oh, nothing, Major.

129
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,954
- Is there anything else I can do for you?
- No, thank you, Major.

130
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,589
- You've done more than you realize.
- Good luck then.

131
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,759
- Good-bye, Major.
- Good-bye.

- Thank you.

Oh.

00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:14,445
Thank you, Captain.

135
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:19,279
I wonder what the army would do
if I deserted.

136
00:10:19,352 --> 00:10:22,287
They'd shoot you.
The thought makes my mouth water.

137
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:25,756

- Which way do we go?

Well, let's get the briefing over.

of my assignment in order to know...

from the quartermaster.

144

- And I may as well warn you, bubble mouth...

a finger on me this trip...

147

you're going back to France
minus a lot of parts you probably value.

There you go again, you blistering idiot.
I didn't touch you!

149

Oh, I'm sorry, Henri, but we're stuck.
We've got to be together for a while...

150
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:06,497
so why not make the best of it?

151
00:11:06,565 --> 00:11:09,932
- There is no best.
- Well, I'll go crazy if you...

152
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:14,701
We turn here. I'll go crazy if you keep losing
that maniac temper every ten minutes.

153
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:18,471
Aw, Henri, let's grow up. I'm sorry
about what happened in the wine cellar.

154
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:22,275
I have no temper. No one ever
accused me of having a temper!

155

- They didn't, eh?
- No!

156
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,545
Do you remember what you were
doing the last time I saw you?

157
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,144
You were chasing me down the Hermann
Goring Strasse in Düsseldorf...

158
00:11:29,221 --> 00:11:31,985
swearing you were gonna
tear my head off and make me eat it!

159
00:11:32,058 --> 00:11:35,892
And what color was I? I was blue.
A lovely, robin's egg blue...

160
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:39,897
- You looked so funny!
- On account of having been pushed
into a vat of dye by you!

161
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,763
- I didn't know it was dye.
I thought it was water.
- Water.

162
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,770
- Blue! All over. Blue.
- [Laughing]

163
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:47,806
It's your own fault anyway...

164
00:11:47,873 --> 00:11:51,502
drinking all that free wine and turning
into an octopus with hands.

165
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:55,104
You misunderstood. You flatter yourself.
I was only trying to be friendly.

166
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:57,649
Oh, I'm sorry I misunderstood.

167
00:11:57,717 --> 00:12:00,845
Well, let's forget it. It's all over with,
and the dye's come off.

168
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,854
- No, it hasn't!
- It hasn't?

169
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:05,413
- No!
- [Laughing] Oh, I'm sorry.

170
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:09,188
Oh. That's all right. There's a certain
advantage in being an oddity.

171
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,195
- In here, Henri.
- Oh.

172
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,194
- Hello, Jack.
- Hello, Catherine. What's so funny?

173
00:12:19,271 --> 00:12:21,205
A little bit difficult to describe.

174
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:23,707
Oh, Henri, this is Captain Ramsey.
Captain Rochard.

175

- Have you some orders for me, Jack?
- All ready. Oh, Burns?

179
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:37,622
You know, Cathy, this means
no dance for me Saturday night.

180
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:39,624
Don't be silly.
You can take Kitty.

181
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,957
I'd rather sit alone in my room and
think of you. Wouldn't you, Captain?

182
00:12:43,028 --> 00:12:45,155
Uh-huh. Alone in my room.

183
00:12:45,231 --> 00:12:48,291
- Better take good care of her.
- I'll watch her every moment.

184
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:50,927
- Oh, that's fine.
- Well, we'd better be getting on.

185
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,335
- Bye, Jack.
- How about dinner the night you get back?

186

- Okay. It's a deal.

191
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,950
I think he's stuck on you.
What's the matter with him?

192
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:16,722
- It's only natural that you
wouldn't understand, Henri.
- It certainly is.

193
00:13:16,796 --> 00:13:21,529
You see, you chase after anything in skirts.
Anything. They're all the same to you.

better than the others. That's called love.

you must have read about it somewhere.

- We... I go that way. I have to get my stuff.

198

- Which way do I go? I have to pay off my cab.
- I'll meet you at the motor pool.

199
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,586
- When?
- Twenty minutes.

200
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:45,954
Before you go, why did you say
I run after everything in skirts?

201
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,617
- I didn't.
- You did.

202
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:50,560
- I said "anything."
- Oh, that's different then.

- He did.

Cheshire cat because a job means
being with him for three days.

- If you work at it.

208
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:09,212
What about the dye?
Is it worn off, or is he still blue?

but he's a lot of fun to fight with.

Oh, I'm sorry. I guess you're
all out of luck, Lieutenant.

216

- We'll settle for a jeep.
- All we got available are
motorcycles and sidecars.

217

- Did you look at your
travel orders, Lieutenant?

218
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:53,558
- What about those cars?
- You got priority four, Captain,
and that's bottom.

219
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:57,856
- Well, Captain, what do we do?
- We'll have to take a motorcycle.

220
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,694
- Are you checked out
on motorcycles, Captain?
- I can drive one.

221

If you ain't checked out, you can't,
and I can't check you out.

- Well, sir, I guess that fixes you up.

My brother had one.
We used to go hill climbing.

- I can even ride one standing up.
- What for?

227
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:23,649
Oh, all right. But I can still ride
a motorcycle. Or are you afraid?

228
00:15:23,722 --> 00:15:27,852
We'll take it, Sergeant.
And I am afraid.

229
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:30,760
- Any one of these, Sergeant?
- Sure, Lieutenant. Take your pick.

230

Remember, Captain, she has to drive it.
That's regulations.

Thank you.

intend to ride that thing? Sidesaddle?

No, Captain.

Yes, Captain.
That's right. Of Germany.

582
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:35,095
- Is something wrong, Officer?
- If you please, Lieutenant.

583
00:44:35,169 --> 00:44:37,763
He says he is French officer
and you know him.

584
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:39,807
I never saw him before in my life.

585
00:44:39,874 --> 00:44:44,072
- That's what I thought!
- You shouldn't have done this
to me, Catherine!

586
00:44:44,145 --> 00:44:46,136
I'll get even! I'll get even!

587
00:44:46,214 --> 00:44:48,648
[Laughs]

588
00:44:48,716 --> 00:44:51,184
I'll get even, traitor! I'll get even!

589
00:44:53,154 --> 00:44:57,318
- Catherine, what is going on here?
- I'll tell you later.

590
00:44:57,391 --> 00:45:01,589
Look. By any chance could you fellows help me
find a German lens grinder named Schindler?

591
00:45:01,662 --> 00:45:03,857
- Sure.
- We ought to be able to help you on that.

592
00:45:03,931 --> 00:45:05,865
- Think so?
- Mm-hmm.

593
00:45:14,342 --> 00:45:16,503
- Is this the man?
- Yes. That's Captain Rochard.

594
00:45:16,577 --> 00:45:19,011
- Good morning, Henri.
- I trust the captain will understand.

595
00:45:19,080 --> 00:45:23,250
There was nothing else we could do.
No identity card. It was not really our fault.

596
00:45:23,383 --> 00:45:26,443
Don't worry. I'm entirely
aware whose fault it was.

597
00:45:26,519 --> 00:45:28,612
Henri, I did exactly as you told me.

598
00:45:28,688 --> 00:45:30,883
Well, thank you, Captain.
Thank you.

599
00:45:30,957 --> 00:45:35,155
- One question. Why have you
no beds in this jail?
- Didn't you have a bed, Henri?

600
00:45:35,228 --> 00:45:39,426
Well, you see, Captain, when we had beds,
everyone wished to be arrested.

601
00:45:39,499 --> 00:45:43,333
It was terrible. The people did anything...
everything... just so they could have a bed.

602
00:45:43,403 --> 00:45:46,531
- I know how they felt.
- Oh, you poor dear.
You haven't had a wink of sleep.

603
00:45:46,606 --> 00:45:49,507
Shut up. May I go now?

604
00:45:49,576 --> 00:45:52,044
- Yes. Of course, Captain.
- Thank you very much.

605
00:45:52,112 --> 00:45:54,239
I'd like to have a word or two
with you outside.

606
00:45:54,314 --> 00:45:57,477
- Of course, Henri. I want to talk to you too.
- Mm-hmm.

607
00:46:00,086 --> 00:46:02,213
Now, before you say anything,
I want you to meet...

608
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:04,689
Listen, you little bug-eyed traitor,
I want you to remember this.

609
00:46:04,758 --> 00:46:06,692
I'll get even. I swear I will.

610
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,524
I'll get even if it takes years.
If it takes forever, I'll get even.

611
00:46:09,596 --> 00:46:11,723
- Please. Captain Rochard.
- Go away. I'm busy.

612
00:46:11,798 --> 00:46:14,426
- I'll break you. I'll break you like a dry twig.
- Henri, this is...

613
00:46:14,501 --> 00:46:18,699
I'll turn you into a shaking old woman with
a tin... Didn't you hear me say I was busy?

614
00:46:18,772 --> 00:46:21,206
- With a tin cup!
- I'm trying to tell you this is...

615
00:46:21,274 --> 00:46:25,540
While I can understand how you
can be an utter rat just for the
fun of it, one thing baffles me.

616
00:46:25,612 --> 00:46:28,080
- Oh, there's no pleasing some people.
- And that's your job.

617
00:46:28,148 --> 00:46:31,879
The army gave you an assignment. You took
an oath as an officer... the oath of duty.

618
00:46:31,951 --> 00:46:35,250
- I just followed your orders.
- Now we'll never find Schindler!
Where is Schindler now?

619
00:46:35,322 --> 00:46:38,155
- Well, he's right...
- He's probably heard
I've been looking for him...

620
00:46:38,224 --> 00:46:41,125
and he's gone underground... maybe left
the country... I know how those fellows work!

621
00:46:41,194 --> 00:46:43,128
- But, Henri...
- What do you want? Who are you?

622
00:46:43,196 --> 00:46:47,155
- I am Schindler.
- Well, that's fine.
Will you please stop annoying...

623
00:46:47,233 --> 00:46:49,167
- You're Schindler?
- Yeah. Schindler.

624
00:46:49,235 --> 00:46:53,103
- Well, why didn't you say so?
- Because you wouldn't give
anybody a chance to say a word.

625
00:46:53,173 --> 00:46:56,768
Now if you'll button that big lip of yours so
Herr Schindler can talk to you for a minute...

626
00:46:56,843 --> 00:46:58,777
he hasn't much time
before his train leaves.

627
00:46:58,845 --> 00:47:04,112
Yeah. All I wanted to say is that I'm so glad...
so grateful, so full of happiness. Thank you.

628
00:47:04,184 --> 00:47:06,118
- Well...
- Good-bye.

629
00:47:06,186 --> 00:47:08,120
- Wait! I want to talk to you.
- He'll miss his train.

630
00:47:08,188 --> 00:47:10,918
Yes. I go to Paris.
French Economic Bureau.

631
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:14,084
I've got my passport and documents
and contract here in my pocket.

632
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,594
- I took them out of your briefcase.
- This wonderful young lady...

633
00:47:16,663 --> 00:47:18,927
- is giving and telling me everything.
- Mm-hmm.

634
00:47:18,998 --> 00:47:22,559
So I leave Germany now.

635
00:47:22,635 --> 00:47:25,160
I never wanted to be
in the black market.

636
00:47:25,238 --> 00:47:31,074
I'm a scientist, and now I will work
for science and for France...

637
00:47:31,144 --> 00:47:34,636
and no more like
a thief in the night.

638
00:47:34,714 --> 00:47:37,842
Thank you.
Thank you.

639
00:47:37,917 --> 00:47:39,851
Good-bye.

640
00:47:41,721 --> 00:47:44,155
Thank you again. Good-bye.

641
00:47:45,225 --> 00:47:48,092
Nice little guy.

642
00:47:48,161 --> 00:47:50,095
Mmm.

643
00:47:59,739 --> 00:48:02,207
- So you found him.
- I ran smack into him.

644
00:48:02,275 --> 00:48:06,439
Someone I knew knew him.
He was very anxious to go, as you heard.

645
00:48:06,513 --> 00:48:10,108
- It was easy.
- Yeah. Easy.

646
00:48:10,183 --> 00:48:11,844
Yeah. Easy.

647
00:48:35,575 --> 00:48:38,373

650
00:48:45,652 --> 00:48:50,954
- Sure!
- Good. You know, there's nothing
I've ever really wanted in life.

651
00:48:51,024 --> 00:48:53,652
Fame, money, position... nothing.

652
00:48:53,726 --> 00:48:56,854
Nothing until now.
There's just one thing.

653
00:48:56,930 --> 00:48:59,797
And that is never to see you
again as long as I live.

654
00:48:59,866 --> 00:49:02,801
That was a mean, rotten thing
to say, and l...

655
00:49:02,869 --> 00:49:05,269
Will you get the coffee, please?

656
00:49:05,338 --> 00:49:10,037
- That was mean rotten.
- Maybe it was mean rotten,
but it wasn't accidental.

657
00:49:10,109 --> 00:49:12,236
Fortunately, I'm getting
out of the army soon.

658
00:49:12,312 --> 00:49:16,612
I'm going to be a civilian, so never again
can they order me to associate with you.

659
00:49:16,683 --> 00:49:19,447
What's more, I'm going back
to Heidelberg by train.

660
00:49:19,519 --> 00:49:23,421
You can get some other chump to torture
in that lunatic sidecar of yours.

661
00:49:23,490 --> 00:49:27,620
Aw, Henri, I know why you're mad,
and I don't blame you. I would be too.

662
00:49:27,694 --> 00:49:30,822
I knew it was your last job
in the army, and I just didn't think.

663
00:49:30,897 --> 00:49:34,833
I spoiled it for you. I'd give anything
if I hadn't. I'd cut off my arm, almost.

664
00:49:34,901 --> 00:49:38,029
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I like you, Henri. I can't help it. I do.

665
00:49:38,104 --> 00:49:41,005
You're stubborn, and you don't know
anything, and you're a fathead.

666
00:49:41,074 --> 00:49:44,976
But I don't want you to go away and
just disappear without saying you'll write...

667
00:49:45,044 --> 00:49:47,808
or kick me or use my toothbrush...

668
00:49:47,881 --> 00:49:50,076
- Oh, for heaven's...
- Well, I wouldn't put it past you!

669
00:49:50,149 --> 00:49:53,277
- And after all we've been to each other.
- And all we haven't been.

670
00:49:53,353 --> 00:49:55,344
- And all we've done together.
- And all...

671
00:49:55,421 --> 00:49:59,016
All we haven't done together.
I know that's not your fault.

672
00:49:59,092 --> 00:50:01,526
It's all mine, and I feel like a...

673
00:50:01,594 --> 00:50:06,657
Oh, I'm making a fool of myself. Now,
get outta here, or say something nice!

674
00:50:06,733 --> 00:50:09,634
Oh. Well, I don't know, Catherine. L...

675
00:50:09,702 --> 00:50:13,297
Oh, that was nice, Henri.
That was nice. Please say more.

676
00:50:15,675 --> 00:50:18,371
Well, if we're gonna get back to Heidelberg
before dark, we'd better be going.

677
00:50:18,444 --> 00:50:21,072
- Oh, Henri!
- But, Catherine...

678
00:50:21,147 --> 00:50:23,081
- Yes, Henri?
- Just one thing.

679
00:50:23,149 --> 00:50:25,481
- What?
- Pay for the coffee.

680
00:50:25,552 --> 00:50:27,486
Yes, Henri.

681
00:50:49,876 --> 00:50:51,810
What happened?
What happened?

682
00:50:51,878 --> 00:50:56,247
Well, you went to sleep,
so I pulled off the side of the road.

683
00:50:56,316 --> 00:50:58,682
- I thought this would be better.
- Thank you.

684
00:50:58,751 --> 00:51:02,152
You know, Henri, I've been thinking.
Why do we fight all the time?

685
00:51:02,221 --> 00:51:05,782
- You tell me.
- Oh, just sex antagonism, I guess.

686
00:51:05,858 --> 00:51:08,019
- What does that mean?
- I don't know exactly...

687
00:51:08,094 --> 00:51:10,961
but I think it means just the opposite
of what it sounds like.

688
00:51:11,030 --> 00:51:13,760
- I can't even think what it sounds like.
- Oh, Henri.

689
00:51:13,833 --> 00:51:16,825
I think it means that we really
like each other but won't admit it.

00:51:24,077 --> 00:51:26,011
I will.

693
00:51:43,830 --> 00:51:45,855
- You all right?
- Sure. Go on back to sleep.

694
00:51:45,932 --> 00:51:49,561
- Why are we stopping?
- I want to see a man about a road.
I'll be back in a minute.

00:51:49,636 --> 00:51:51,570

00:53:51,357 --> 00:53:54,258
- Darling? Did I say that?
- I heard you.

726
00:53:54,327 --> 00:53:56,386
It's probably fright.
It's only natural that...

727
00:53:56,462 --> 00:53:58,521
Did you mean me, Henri?

728
00:53:58,598 --> 00:54:01,431
Uh, I think I was
stunned momentarily.

729
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:05,494
Well, maybe you were, but you looked like
you were going to kiss me when you saw me.

730
00:54:05,571 --> 00:54:09,632
- I what?
- I wish you had. I've never
been kissed by a Frenchman.

731
00:54:09,709 --> 00:54:12,906
Well, there's not...
What's so strange about that?

732
00:54:12,979 --> 00:54:15,038
Oh, you know what people say.

733
00:54:15,114 --> 00:54:18,277
- Oh, that's nonsense.
- Well, you just hear people talk.

734
00:54:18,351 --> 00:54:20,410
We're no different
than anybody else.

735
00:54:20,486 --> 00:54:23,717
- Well, I don't know. I've just heard talk.
- That's silly.

736
00:54:23,790 --> 00:54:26,850
Why don't you try it just once,
and let me see?

737
00:54:26,926 --> 00:54:29,861
- Oh, Catherine!
- That's the only way to find out, isn't it?

738
00:54:29,929 --> 00:54:33,888
- But I tell you, it's so silly.
- Well, there's no harm in trying, is there?

739
00:54:33,966 --> 00:54:37,299
- No. I suppose not.
- Well, all right. Go ahead.

740
00:54:38,604 --> 00:54:41,038
- Hmm. Well, are you ready?
- Sure.

741
00:54:46,579 --> 00:54:49,776
- There. You see?
- That was no good. That wasn't
the least bit different.

742
00:54:49,849 --> 00:54:52,215
I told you it wasn't going
to be any different.

743
00:54:52,285 --> 00:54:55,482
But I thought it'd be better than that.

744
00:54:55,555 --> 00:54:58,023
Well, after all, you didn't
give me much of a chance.

745
00:54:58,090 --> 00:55:00,991
- Oh, that wasn't fair, was it?
- What do you expect? Of course it wasn't.

746
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:03,460
- I really should give you another chance.
- Yes, you ought.

747
00:55:03,529 --> 00:55:05,759
Well, all right.
Go ahead. Try again.

748
00:55:05,832 --> 00:55:08,323
All right.

749
00:55:08,401 --> 00:55:10,335
Here. Come here.

750
00:55:14,874 --> 00:55:17,809
Well! That was a little better.

751
00:55:17,877 --> 00:55:21,506
Certainly. You see? It could have been
even better if I'd had some cooperation.

752
00:55:21,581 --> 00:55:24,015
If I'd had a French girl,
it would have been fine.

753
00:55:24,083 --> 00:55:26,210
Wait. What did you mean
by that remark?

754
00:55:26,285 --> 00:55:29,482
Well, you haven't been
giving me much help.

755
00:55:29,555 --> 00:55:32,149
- Oh. And you think a French
girl could do better?
- Yes. I do.

756
00:55:32,225 --> 00:55:34,284
- Do you want to try it again?
- Do you want to try it again?

757
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:38,262
- Yes.
- Well, so do I.

758
00:55:38,331 --> 00:55:41,960
Wait a minute. Lean back.
Are you comfortable?

759
00:55:42,034 --> 00:55:43,968
- Yes.
- Good.

760
00:55:45,438 --> 00:55:48,134
Major, we... we want to get married.

761
00:55:48,207 --> 00:55:50,767
Well! When did you reach
that decision?

762
00:55:50,843 --> 00:55:53,641
- This afternoon, about 2:30.
- In a haystack.

763
00:55:53,713 --> 00:55:55,943
You see, Henri was
on the motorcycle, and l...

764
00:55:56,015 --> 00:55:58,483
Catherine, I don't think the major
would be interested in all the details.

765
00:55:58,551 --> 00:56:01,111
And you two didn't want
to go away together.

766
00:56:01,187 --> 00:56:03,747
It would seem your mission
was very successful.

767
00:56:03,823 --> 00:56:05,882
- Thank you, Major.
- My congratulations.

768
00:56:05,958 --> 00:56:08,654
- You're the very first to know.
- I guessed as much.

769
00:56:08,728 --> 00:56:10,923
Now, as to getting married,
there's one hitch.

770
00:56:10,997 --> 00:56:13,227
- Itch?
- It's probably the haystack. Henri and l...

771
00:56:13,299 --> 00:56:15,494
- I don't... I don't...
- I said "hitch."

772
00:56:15,568 --> 00:56:18,935
All marriages between American
military personnel and aliens...

773
00:56:19,005 --> 00:56:20,996
- and you come under that heading, Captain...
- Ah.

774
00:56:21,073 --> 00:56:23,200
Must be approved
by the commanding general.

775
00:56:23,276 --> 00:56:25,471
- Now, there's a set procedure
for that kind of thing.
- Yes, but...

776
00:56:25,544 --> 00:56:28,172
- It's only red tape, Henri.
- Well, do you itch, Catherine?

777
00:56:28,247 --> 00:56:31,842
The major said "hitch," Henri. She means
we've got to get a lot of things approved.

778
00:56:31,918 --> 00:56:34,250
- Oh.
- Here are the forms
requesting permission to marry.

779
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:36,254
Fill them out in quadruplicate...

780
00:56:36,322 --> 00:56:38,620
and when you've completed them,
send them to Colonel Bliven's office.

781
00:56:38,691 --> 00:56:41,023
- Yes, Major.
- And good luck.

782
00:56:43,396 --> 00:56:46,024
- Good-bye, Captain.
- Yes.

783
00:56:49,502 --> 00:56:53,063
- Is she always so confusing?
- No. But this is going to be.

784
00:56:53,139 --> 00:56:55,437
- What's the matter?
- Look at all this stuff we've got to fill out.

785
00:56:55,508 --> 00:56:59,877
- She said there was four of them.
- You weren't hearing so good.
She said four of each.

786
00:56:59,946 --> 00:57:01,811
- Let's go and get to work.
- Fine.

787
00:57:01,881 --> 00:57:04,008
Wait a minute. Wait. Wait.

788
00:57:07,286 --> 00:57:10,517
- Souvenir.
- You'll end up with a pocketful.

789
00:57:15,194 --> 00:57:17,924
Well, this is impossible.

790
00:57:17,997 --> 00:57:20,124
Don't give up now.
We're halfway through.

791
00:57:20,199 --> 00:57:23,225
My uncle's politics, aunt's religion,
any warts, any...

792
00:57:23,302 --> 00:57:27,068
By the way, my aunt's name is Fanny.
Would you put that down, please?

793
00:57:27,139 --> 00:57:30,734
Any identifying scars
on my second cousin's clavicle?

794
00:57:30,810 --> 00:57:35,509
We'll never get this done. And look at this
silly thing. "Name your father's gender."

795
00:57:35,581 --> 00:57:38,482
- No.
- Yeah. It says so. Look.

796
00:57:38,551 --> 00:57:42,385
No. "Father's birthplace."
Gender belongs to this question over here.

797
00:57:42,455 --> 00:57:45,288
- I thought there was something wrong.
- What an idiot.

798
00:57:45,358 --> 00:57:48,623
- Were you ever captured by Peruvian Indians?
- No. Why?

799
00:57:48,694 --> 00:57:51,663
I understand they do a very good job
of shrinking heads.

800
00:57:51,731 --> 00:57:54,393
Mmm. Come on.

801
00:57:54,467 --> 00:57:56,901
Come on. Let's take time out.

802
00:57:59,672 --> 00:58:03,472
Oh, there are a lot of things
I'd rather do than answer questions.

803
00:58:03,542 --> 00:58:06,943
- This, for instance?
- Mm-hmm.

804
00:58:08,714 --> 00:58:11,410
Maybe I'd better go back
and see another double feature.

805
00:58:11,484 --> 00:58:13,551
<i>[Catherine]</i>
<i>Oh, no. Come on in.</i>

806
00:58:13,684 --> 00:58:15,777
We're still filling out forms.

807
00:58:15,853 --> 00:58:18,788
If you find anyone who wants
to fill out forms with me, let me know.

808
00:58:18,856 --> 00:58:20,790
- I'm gonna get some sleep.
- Good night.

809
00:58:20,858 --> 00:58:22,792
- Good night.
- See you in the morning.

810
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,226
- We gotta get busy.
- Oh.

811
00:58:25,296 --> 00:58:27,594
Why do we have
to go through all this?

812
00:58:27,665 --> 00:58:30,828
It's the army's way of finding out
if you really want to get married.

813
00:58:30,901 --> 00:58:33,335
- Well, I know a much better way.
- Henri.

814
00:59:31,128 --> 00:59:33,119
[Ringing]

815
00:59:34,531 --> 00:59:37,364
Major Prendergast. Yes.

816
00:59:37,434 --> 00:59:41,370
At ease, Gates.
That'll be all right. Well, Gates?

817
00:59:41,438 --> 00:59:45,875
I'm sorry to bother you, Major, but we haven't
heard a word about our application.

818
00:59:45,943 --> 00:59:49,401
- It's been over a week.
- Your papers must've
bogged down somewhere.

819
00:59:49,480 --> 00:59:51,505
Isn't there something you can do
to hurry them up?

820
00:59:51,582 --> 00:59:53,948
He's getting awfully nervous,
and so am I.

821
00:59:54,018 --> 00:59:57,977
- I'll see what I can do. I'll let you know.
- Thank you, Major.

822
00:59:58,055 --> 00:59:59,989
- Oh, Gates.
- Yes, Major?

823
01:00:00,057 --> 01:00:03,458
- He <i>is</i> worth waiting for, isn't he?
- Well, he is now.

824
01:00:03,527 --> 01:00:06,860
I don't know what he'll be like
by the time I get him.

825
01:00:18,475 --> 01:00:22,002
I can't understand an American
marrying a foreigner she hardly knows.

826
01:00:22,079 --> 01:00:24,013
It's ridiculous and disgraceful.

827
01:00:24,081 --> 01:00:28,245
- I just can't see why she wants to.
- You all better get glasses.

828
01:00:28,318 --> 01:00:31,810
Why are you women such pushovers for
this <i>parlez vous</i> hand kissing stuff?

829
01:00:31,889 --> 01:00:34,517
Hand kissing?
Why, he does more than that.

830
01:00:34,591 --> 01:00:36,821
Why, Catherine told me
he was plumb crazy.

831
01:00:36,894 --> 01:00:39,362
Always chasing her
and trying to beat her up.

832
01:00:39,430 --> 01:00:42,024
Why, he left marks
all over her. I saw 'em.

833
01:00:42,099 --> 01:00:46,001
- Leave marks on me any time.
I'll bring the stick.
- Oh, it wasn't a stick.

834
01:00:46,070 --> 01:00:48,470
- He kicked her right in the...
- What?

835
01:00:48,539 --> 01:00:50,564
- Well, he did.
- Hi, Catherine.

836
01:00:50,641 --> 01:00:52,871
- We were just talking about you, honey.
- I'll bet you were.

837
01:00:56,847 --> 01:00:58,838
Oh.

838
01:01:00,884 --> 01:01:03,114
Well, say something.
Did you see her?

839
01:01:03,187 --> 01:01:06,850
- Don't lose your temper.
The papers are stuck somewhere.
- Stuck, how?

840
01:01:06,924 --> 01:01:09,415
Well, bogged down in channels,
lying on someone's desk.

841
01:01:09,493 --> 01:01:12,360
- What for?
- Henri, please. I don't know.

842
01:01:12,429 --> 01:01:15,364
Well, they let other people get married.
What have they got against you?

843
01:01:15,432 --> 01:01:17,992
Against me? It's probably you
they're investigating.

844
01:01:18,068 --> 01:01:20,093
- Nonsense. Why should they?
- Henri, please.

845
01:01:20,170 --> 01:01:22,798
- There are other people in the room.
- Why should they investigate me?

846
01:01:22,873 --> 01:01:25,637
Because the American army
is very careful. That's why.

847
01:01:25,709 --> 01:01:28,974
American army had better be careful,
or they're not gonna have any
American children soon.

848
01:01:29,046 --> 01:01:31,810
- Will you kindly lower your voice?
- I'll do better than that.

849
01:01:31,882 --> 01:01:33,816
I'll take it somewhere else
if it annoys you.

850
01:01:33,884 --> 01:01:36,250
Do that, and while you're about it,
go bag your oars.

851
01:01:36,320 --> 01:01:39,016
- "Bag your oars"?
What's that, more army talk?
- Navy.

852
01:01:39,089 --> 01:01:41,250
Oh, naval talk.
It sounds like it. Charming.

853
01:01:41,325 --> 01:01:43,520
- You make me sick.
- Good.

854
01:01:43,594 --> 01:01:45,585
Henri.

855
01:01:48,866 --> 01:01:50,857
Excuse me.

856
01:01:53,337 --> 01:01:56,397
Catherine, let me ask you something
like a brother.

857
01:01:56,473 --> 01:01:59,203
- Do you really wanna marry that phony joker?
- Certainly not.

858
01:01:59,276 --> 01:02:02,268
- You're kidding.
- I hope he chokes. Slowly, very slowly.

859
01:02:02,346 --> 01:02:06,612
That's what I said all along. A girl like you...
you couldn't make a mistake like that.

860
01:02:06,683 --> 01:02:10,517
- Thank heavens for army red tape.
- Oh, don't thank the army.

861
01:02:10,587 --> 01:02:12,680
- You can thank me personally.
- You? Why?

862
01:02:12,756 --> 01:02:15,691
I hid the papers. I knew it was
a cinch you'd change your mind.

863
01:02:15,759 --> 01:02:18,751
- You hid the papers?
- That's right. I knew I was doing you a favor.

864
01:02:18,829 --> 01:02:21,297
- You hid the papers.
- I put them in the advance file.

865
01:02:21,365 --> 01:02:25,461
Don't mind going out on a limb
for a friend. It was taking a chance, sure...

866
01:02:40,784 --> 01:02:44,413
Now as to your marriage, you, Catherine,
want me to marry you in my church.

867
01:02:44,488 --> 01:02:46,956
- That's right.
- And you, Henri, always promised...

868
01:02:47,024 --> 01:02:49,151
the pastor of your parish
that he'd do the job.

869
01:02:49,226 --> 01:02:51,558
- Yes.
- I think you'd better have both marriages.

There's more to it than that.

Under the German law, which is

- Ah.

876
01:03:08,245 --> 01:03:10,736
And then come to me,
and then go to Henri's pastor.

Chaplain, did you know that in China,
the bride and groom just drink tea...

879
01:03:17,187 --> 01:03:20,350
- out of the same bowl, and that's it?
- Are you Chinese, Henri?

880
01:03:20,424 --> 01:03:23,188
- Of course I'm not Chinese.
- I didn't think you were. I'm not.

881
01:03:23,260 --> 01:03:25,785
- What brought that up?
- You just said something about drinking tea.

882
01:03:25,863 --> 01:03:29,162
- I was telling the chaplain...
- I'll drink tea with you if you want me to.

- You do?
- Stop it. Stop it.

884

go through with this.
- You can still say no, Henri.

885
01:03:35,873 --> 01:03:39,400
- We'll go to the <i>bürgermeister,</i>

We've got a lot of things to do.

1013
01:12:39,514 --> 01:12:42,540
<i>I am hurrying,</i>
<i>just as fast as I can go.</i>

1014
01:12:42,617 --> 01:12:44,847
Well, straighten up.
You look like a question mark.

1015
01:12:44,919 --> 01:12:47,387
- Oh! Thank you.
- There. That's better.

1016
01:12:47,455 --> 01:12:50,322
[Sighs]
What a place to put a faucet.

1017
01:12:50,391 --> 01:12:52,325
- Where?
- In the middle of my back.

1018
01:12:52,393 --> 01:12:54,554
It is unusual.
Well, cheer up, dear.

1019
01:12:54,629 --> 01:12:56,620
At least tonight
you'll have a bed to sleep on.

1020
01:12:56,698 --> 01:13:00,327
Well, that's just it.
Catherine, I don't mean to sound cranky...

1021
01:13:00,401 --> 01:13:03,393
but this situation is so unnatural.

1022
01:13:03,471 --> 01:13:05,803
I'll be at B.O.Q. And you'll be
sleeping miles away...

1023
01:13:05,873 --> 01:13:07,807
all because
the United States Army...

1024
01:13:07,875 --> 01:13:09,809
We haven't got time
to look for another place today.

1025
01:13:09,877 --> 01:13:12,277
We've got to see
the American consul. Come on, silly.

1026
01:13:12,347 --> 01:13:17,182
- What are you doing in the gutter?
- Where else would I be?

1027
01:13:17,251 --> 01:13:20,516
Now, I know it's very important
and you're in a hurry...

1028
01:13:20,588 --> 01:13:22,613
but it's not gonna be easy.

1029
01:13:22,690 --> 01:13:26,456
Take the matter of support. Captain, have
you any money in the United States?

1030
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:28,927
- No.
- And the laws of your country...

1031
01:13:28,997 --> 01:13:31,761
forbid you taking anything
but a nominal amount with you.

1032
01:13:31,833 --> 01:13:33,767
Yes, I'm afraid that's right.

1033
01:13:33,835 --> 01:13:36,326
Then a visitor's visa
would do you no good.

1034
01:13:36,404 --> 01:13:39,771
You couldn't take a job.
And unless your wife can prove...

1035
01:13:39,841 --> 01:13:43,368
that she's able to support you,
you couldn't get a permanent visa.

1036
01:13:43,444 --> 01:13:47,210
Catherine isn't going to support me,
so is there any other kind of visa?

1037
01:13:47,281 --> 01:13:49,215
What about the French quota?

1038
01:13:49,283 --> 01:13:51,774
The French quota's completely
filled up for this year and next.

1039
01:13:51,853 --> 01:13:54,151
- Well, what'll we do?
- I was wondering...

1040
01:13:54,222 --> 01:13:57,658
if public law 271 would apply.

1041
01:13:57,725 --> 01:14:00,592
That's the one regulating
the immigration of war brides.

1042
01:14:00,661 --> 01:14:03,630
Catherine doesn't have to immigrate.
She's an American citizen.

1043
01:14:03,698 --> 01:14:06,064
I was thinking of you as the bride.

1044
01:14:06,134 --> 01:14:10,002
[Chuckles] That's a pretty good
imagination you have there.

1045
01:14:10,071 --> 01:14:12,835
It says spouses.
Doesn't mention sex.

1046
01:14:12,907 --> 01:14:15,603
I'm convinced the American army
doesn't believe in it.

1047
01:14:15,676 --> 01:14:19,168
This is gonna work.
Yes, I think this is gonna work.

1048
01:14:19,247 --> 01:14:22,114
- Well, sure, it will. Say, this is wonderful.
- What's so wonderful?

1049
01:14:22,183 --> 01:14:25,414
It says spouses means mates.
Doesn't say anything about male or female.

1050
01:14:25,486 --> 01:14:28,478
- We're mates, aren't we?
- [Chuckles] I really wouldn't know.

1051
01:14:28,556 --> 01:14:31,821
You're a spouse of a member
of the American expedition forces.

1052
01:14:31,893 --> 01:14:33,861
Therefore, you're eligible to travel...

1053
01:14:33,928 --> 01:14:38,831
- under section 271 as her bride.
- As her bride?

1054
01:14:38,900 --> 01:14:40,834
- No, Henri, please.
- As your bride?

1055
01:14:40,902 --> 01:14:42,836
- Oh, Henri, it'll be fun.
- But isn't it ridic...

1056
01:14:42,904 --> 01:14:46,032
Of course it is, darling, but it'll work.
You'll see. It's the only way.

1057
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:48,234
Here's the application right here.

1058
01:14:48,309 --> 01:14:52,609
I am not going to travel as her bride.
And besides, her name's Rochard.

1059
01:14:52,680 --> 01:14:56,673
Excuse me, Captain Rochard,
but officially, it's still Gates.

1060
01:14:56,751 --> 01:14:59,379
Not at all.
Officially, it is Rochard.

1061
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:02,218
- I have three wedding certificates to prove it.
- Henri.

1062
01:15:02,290 --> 01:15:04,281
I don't care.
Rochard. Rochard.

1063
01:15:04,358 --> 01:15:07,486
Pay no attention to him, Mr. Jones.
What do we have to do?

1064
01:15:07,562 --> 01:15:11,464
Here you fill out your name, rank,
organization, your wife's maiden name.

1065
01:15:11,532 --> 01:15:14,433
- She hasn't got a wife.
- Just for the time being.

1066
01:15:14,502 --> 01:15:17,630
- Have you got a wife?
- No, dear. But it's only a piece of paper.

1067
01:15:17,705 --> 01:15:20,071
- Well, then you...
- Well, obviously these applications...

1068
01:15:20,141 --> 01:15:22,405
are intended for
the husband to fill in.

1069
01:15:22,477 --> 01:15:24,240
Oh, well, I can write.
I can write.

1070
01:15:24,312 --> 01:15:28,009
- Yes, we know, dear. You can write.
- No, this doesn't apply to you.

1071
01:15:28,082 --> 01:15:30,243
You'll just have to make
the proper adjustments.

1072
01:15:30,318 --> 01:15:32,548
- What?
- On these papers.

1073
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:34,611
- You want to go, don't you?
- What?

1074
01:15:34,689 --> 01:15:36,657
I tell you, Henri,
it's the only way.

1075
01:15:36,724 --> 01:15:39,454
Just hand those over to the immigration
officer when you've filled them out.

1076
01:15:39,527 --> 01:15:41,461
- Thank you, Mr. Jones.
- But, Catherine...

1077
01:15:41,529 --> 01:15:43,463
It'll be simple. You'll see.

1078
01:15:43,531 --> 01:15:46,500
On the contrary, the process
of turning a man into a woman...

1079
01:15:46,567 --> 01:15:49,559
is <i>enormously</i> complicated.

1080
01:15:49,637 --> 01:15:53,403
- But I'll do my best. Thank you. Good day.
- Good day.

1081
01:15:53,474 --> 01:15:55,066
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

1082
01:15:55,143 --> 01:15:57,202
Just a moment.
Brides first, please.

1083
01:15:57,278 --> 01:16:00,042
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- That's all right.

1084
01:16:07,588 --> 01:16:09,522
Hello, Henri.

1085
01:16:09,590 --> 01:16:12,650
- Well, nothing happened.
- Hasn't it come yet?

1086
01:16:12,727 --> 01:16:14,661
I wonder if the application
even arrived.

1087
01:16:14,729 --> 01:16:18,358
I handed it to the immigration officer
myself first thing this morning.

1088
01:16:18,432 --> 01:16:21,094
Henri, brace yourself. I'm leaving.

1089
01:16:21,169 --> 01:16:24,832
- Our whole outfit leaves tonight.
- Tonight?

1090
01:16:24,906 --> 01:16:26,840
Oh, well, that does it.
We're cooked.

1091
01:16:26,908 --> 01:16:30,969
- The application will come
this afternoon. It's got to.
- It won't. Oh, you'll see.

1092
01:16:31,045 --> 01:16:33,946
You'll go, and I'll sit here
wondering which sex I am.

1093
01:16:34,015 --> 01:16:36,882
What a marriage. Solitary confinement.
Separate rooms.

1094
01:16:36,951 --> 01:16:38,885
I've never been
so lonely in my life.

1095
01:16:38,953 --> 01:16:41,922
- If I have to leave you, I'll shoot myself.
- Shoot me too. I'm...

1096
01:16:41,989 --> 01:16:45,288
- I think this is it. It came to the office.
- Thank you, Kitty.

1097
01:16:45,359 --> 01:16:48,385
[Muttering]

1098
01:16:48,462 --> 01:16:51,397
At last.

1099
01:16:51,465 --> 01:16:54,662
"Dear madame"?
Oh, yes, that's me.

1100
01:16:54,735 --> 01:16:57,533
"Following application
of your husband..." that's you...

1101
01:16:57,605 --> 01:17:00,005
"you are informed that permission
to enter the United States...

1102
01:17:00,074 --> 01:17:02,304
as a war bride has been granted."

1103
01:17:02,376 --> 01:17:04,310
- I gotta get back. I'll see you later.
- Thanks, Kitty.

1104
01:17:04,378 --> 01:17:07,779
- I'm so happy. Kiss me.
- We've got time now. That can wait.

1105
01:17:07,848 --> 01:17:11,841
- Or maybe it can't.
- Oh, no, darling. No, no, Henri.
Please, the letter.

1106
01:17:11,919 --> 01:17:15,355
"Please fill in attached form
and bring to this..."

1107
01:17:15,423 --> 01:17:18,756
Another form.
Will they ever run out of forms?

1108
01:17:18,826 --> 01:17:21,260
- Hmm. Hmm.
- [Chuckles]

1109
01:17:23,130 --> 01:17:25,360
I won't. I won't answer
those questions.

1110
01:17:25,433 --> 01:17:29,335
- Oh. Well, Henri, this isn't so bad.
- I won't answer those questions.

1111
01:17:29,403 --> 01:17:31,337
- You've got to.
- I won't!

1112
01:17:31,405 --> 01:17:33,339
- You don't wanna stay, do you?
- No.

1113
01:17:33,407 --> 01:17:35,341
- Then you've got to answer them.
- How can I?

1114
01:17:35,409 --> 01:17:38,207
You can, Henri, and perhaps the man
at the office will help you.

1115
01:17:38,279 --> 01:17:40,941
- It wouldn't be possible.
- Now, please, control yourself
for once and be nice.

1116
01:17:41,015 --> 01:17:43,279
- How can you answer a single...
- Everything will be all right.

1117
01:17:43,351 --> 01:17:46,548
Be sure and read them over on the
way down. Good-bye, Henri. Good luck.

1118
01:17:46,921 --> 01:17:50,322
- I tell you, there isn't another form.
- <i>I told you first.</i>

1119
01:17:50,391 --> 01:17:53,326
- This form isn't for a man. It's for a woman.
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

1120
01:17:53,394 --> 01:17:56,955
On the other hand, if you don't get this form
filled out and approved, you can't go.

1121
01:17:57,031 --> 01:18:00,694
- That's right.
- You mean I've got to use this form?

1122
01:18:00,768 --> 01:18:02,599
Sergeant,
I felt the same way you do...

1123
01:18:02,670 --> 01:18:06,606
but if that's the only form,
come on, let's fill it out.

1124
01:18:06,674 --> 01:18:10,667
Well, let's see. Age and birthplace.
We've got all that.

1125
01:18:10,745 --> 01:18:13,145
Well, here's the first one.

1126
01:18:13,214 --> 01:18:15,182
Are you an expectant mother?

1127
01:18:15,249 --> 01:18:17,979
Uh-huh.

1128
01:18:18,052 --> 01:18:21,351
Yes. How many months?

1129
01:18:21,422 --> 01:18:23,652
Twenty.

1130
01:18:23,724 --> 01:18:27,626
Twenty. Twenty months.

1131
01:18:27,695 --> 01:18:31,187
Any... Any female trouble?

1132
01:18:31,265 --> 01:18:34,701
Nothing but, Sergeant.
[Groans]

1133
01:18:36,037 --> 01:18:40,098
And... have you ever had
any children before?

1134
01:18:40,174 --> 01:18:43,905
Oh, my aching back. You know
that awful feeling before breakfast?

1135
01:18:43,978 --> 01:18:46,378
- No, Captain, I don't.
- Oh, Sergeant, you're lucky.

1136
01:18:46,447 --> 01:18:48,347
Captain, this doesn't make any sense.

1137
01:18:48,416 --> 01:18:51,385
I know, but come on. We gotta
fill it out. Ask me another.

1138
01:18:51,452 --> 01:18:53,750
There's some good ones coming up.

1139
01:18:57,858 --> 01:19:00,258
<i>[Woman Over P.A.]</i>
<i>Attention, please. Attention, please.</i>

1140
01:19:00,328 --> 01:19:03,627
<i>Will Mrs. Milton</i>
<i>come to the desk, please.</i>

1141
01:19:06,033 --> 01:19:09,833
You take seat 18
in bus number three.

1142
01:19:13,541 --> 01:19:15,406
All right, Mrs. Rochard...

1143
01:19:15,476 --> 01:19:19,708
- you take seat 19 in bus number three.
- Thank you.

1144
01:19:19,780 --> 01:19:23,978
- Wait a minute! You're not Mrs. Rochard.
- I'm Mr. Rochard.

1145
01:19:24,051 --> 01:19:27,043
It's your wife who must report here
for transportation to Bremerhaven.

1146
01:19:27,121 --> 01:19:30,989
- According to the war department,
I <i>am</i> my wife.
- You can't be your wife!

1147
01:19:31,058 --> 01:19:34,858
If the American army says that I can
be my wife, who am I to dispute them?

1148
01:19:34,929 --> 01:19:39,662
- This is all wrong.
- Major, for your information, I am a war bride.

1149
01:19:39,734 --> 01:19:42,225
- A war bride?
- Yeah.

1150
01:19:42,303 --> 01:19:44,464
- Well, I'm slightly confused.
- I don't blame you...

1151
01:19:44,538 --> 01:19:47,974
but the official wording says
I am "an alien spouse...

1152
01:19:48,042 --> 01:19:51,011
"of female military personnel

01:28:08,343 --> 01:28:12,439
- No, no, no. Not now, thank you.
- <i>What are you doin'here?</i>

1293
01:28:12,513 --> 01:28:14,913
Oh, I had a feeling.

1294
01:28:18,353 --> 01:28:21,186
I am an alien spouse
of female military personnel...

1295
01:28:21,256 --> 01:28:25,124
en route to the United States
under public law 271 of the congress.

1296
01:28:25,193 --> 01:28:28,162
Well, why aren't you
at the dependents' hotel?

1297
01:28:28,229 --> 01:28:30,527
I am writing a book about that.

1298
01:28:30,598 --> 01:28:33,066
You see, I'm not a woman.

1299
01:28:33,134 --> 01:28:35,967
That's too bad.
But I tell you one thing, friend...

1300
01:28:36,037 --> 01:28:38,562
- You can't sleep here.
- Can't sleep here.

1301
01:28:38,640 --> 01:28:42,804
You will note, I have not taken
off my clothes in anticipation of that.

1302
01:28:42,877 --> 01:28:45,869
- Where will I go?
- I don't know, but you...

1303
01:28:45,947 --> 01:28:47,881
- Can't sleep here.
- That's right.

1304
01:28:47,949 --> 01:28:50,008
We're agreed.
Where will I go?

1305
01:28:50,084 --> 01:28:52,814
Well, there's only one place left,
and that's a German hotel.

1306
01:28:52,887 --> 01:28:54,878
- But you're a dependent, aren't you?
- Mm-hmm.

1307
01:28:54,956 --> 01:28:57,288
And as a dependent,
you come under military law...

1308
01:28:57,358 --> 01:29:00,259
and all the German hotels
are out of bounds.

1309
01:29:00,328 --> 01:29:03,126
- Where will I go?
- I don't know, mister.

1310
01:29:03,197 --> 01:29:05,165
I'm sorry,
but there's an army rule.

1311
01:29:05,233 --> 01:29:08,225
- And you can't sleep here.
- Can't sleep here.

1312
01:29:12,340 --> 01:29:14,467
Beg your pardon.

1313
01:29:16,277 --> 01:29:20,475
- Where will you go?
- I don't know.

1314
01:29:20,548 --> 01:29:22,675
It's a shame.
Because if we was in Brooklyn...

1315
01:29:22,750 --> 01:29:25,310
you could've slept
with the old man.

1316
01:29:45,173 --> 01:29:47,107
Hiya.

1317
01:29:48,409 --> 01:29:50,400
Oh. Hi.

1318
01:29:52,847 --> 01:29:55,748
- What can I do for you?
- Well, uh...

1319
01:29:55,817 --> 01:29:58,183
I'm looking for a place to sleep.
Can you help me?

1320
01:29:58,252 --> 01:30:00,516
Afraid not. Nothing but women
sleepin' in there.

1321
01:30:00,588 --> 01:30:03,489
Yeah, I know. Building 11.
My wife's in there.

1322
01:30:03,558 --> 01:30:06,459
- A lot of people's wives are in there.
- Yeah.

1323
01:30:06,527 --> 01:30:10,486
Have you ever noticed that women always get
a place to sleep? I wonder why that is.

1324
01:30:10,565 --> 01:30:13,227
Well, I suppose it's because
they're the weaker sex.

1325
01:30:13,301 --> 01:30:17,032
I don't believe it. I believe
they're stronger. And do you know why?

1326
01:30:17,105 --> 01:30:19,266
Because they get enough sleep,
that's why.

1327
01:30:19,340 --> 01:30:21,934
I am sorry I can't help you.

1328
01:30:22,009 --> 01:30:25,342
[Chuckles]
Well, very kind of you, Corporal.

1329
01:30:25,413 --> 01:30:27,881
Good night. You from Brooklyn?

1330
01:30:27,949 --> 01:30:30,440
Yonkers.

1331
01:30:30,518 --> 01:30:32,543
What are those?

1332
01:30:34,522 --> 01:30:36,820
Good night, buddy.

1333
01:30:46,901 --> 01:30:50,598
I am an alien spouse of female military
personnel en route to the United States...

1334
01:30:50,671 --> 01:30:53,265
under public law 271
of the congress...

1335
01:30:53,341 --> 01:30:55,275
and I've been everywhere in town
looking for a place to sleep.

1336
01:30:55,343 --> 01:30:59,109
You poor man. Well, you can't stay here.
This is a female building.

1337
01:30:59,180 --> 01:31:02,343
It is?
[Mutters]

1338
01:31:02,417 --> 01:31:05,580
Another woman's building.
You know, I've come to the conclusion...

1339
01:31:05,653 --> 01:31:07,712
that American men don't sleep.

1340
01:31:07,789 --> 01:31:10,553
Well, not in this building.

1341
01:31:10,625 --> 01:31:13,788
I was wondering if there'd be any
objection to my sitting here for a while.

1342
01:31:13,861 --> 01:31:16,796
You could sort of imagine
I'm waiting for something.

1343
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:20,425
Well, it all depends on what
you imagine you're waiting for.

1344
01:31:20,501 --> 01:31:23,265
I'm sure I don't want to send you
out on a night like this.

1345
01:31:23,337 --> 01:31:26,500
That's very kind. That's nice.

1346
01:31:26,574 --> 01:31:29,975
Tell me, what part of the United States
do you come from?

1347
01:31:30,044 --> 01:31:34,413
- Boston, up in Massachusetts.
- Massachu-chu-chu...

1348
01:31:34,482 --> 01:31:36,814
Right. Is there a place
called Yonkers?

1349
01:31:36,884 --> 01:31:40,421
- Sure. It's in New York.
- Oh. I was wondering.

1350
01:31:40,554 --> 01:31:43,284
Well, I'm...
I'm a little mixed up.

1351
01:31:43,357 --> 01:31:46,520
- May I hold that for you?
- Oh, thanks.

1352
01:31:46,593 --> 01:31:48,686
[Sighs]
You see, I just got married.

1353
01:31:48,762 --> 01:31:50,753
Well, where's your wife?

1354
01:31:50,831 --> 01:31:54,130
Oh, she's in another female building.
Building 11.

1355
01:31:54,201 --> 01:31:57,693
- And you couldn't find a bed anywhere?
- No... Well, almost.

1356
01:31:57,771 --> 01:31:59,705
There was, uh...
There was one in Brooklyn...

1357
01:31:59,773 --> 01:32:02,071
- and another one with a woman in it.
- A woman?

1358
01:32:02,142 --> 01:32:04,975
- He was a very disagreeable man.
- Who was?

1359
01:32:05,045 --> 01:32:08,674
Her husband. Yeah, it would've been
nicer in Brooklyn.

1360
01:32:08,749 --> 01:32:12,207
- With the husband?
- No. The old man.

1361
01:32:12,286 --> 01:32:14,481
You <i>are</i> tired, aren't you?

1362
01:32:24,832 --> 01:32:27,596
- There he is. I'll see you on the boat.
- Okay.

1363
01:32:27,668 --> 01:32:29,602
Pardon me. Excuse me.

1364
01:32:29,670 --> 01:32:31,729
Pardon me.

1365
01:32:33,707 --> 01:32:36,301
Oh, darling, I was afraid
you'd missed the last bus.

1366
01:32:36,376 --> 01:32:40,005
- Oh, sailor, could you take these bags, please?
- All right.

1367
01:32:40,080 --> 01:32:43,015
Thank you. Henri...
Henri, you look awful.

1368
01:32:43,083 --> 01:32:45,574
- What have you been doing?
- I've been sitting up
all night with a redhead.

1369
01:32:45,652 --> 01:32:47,415
- What?
- Knitting.

1370
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:49,547
- What?
- You ought to see me purl.

1371
01:32:49,623 --> 01:32:52,490
- Oh, you ought to see her purl.
- What are you talking about?

1372
01:32:52,559 --> 01:32:54,493
<i>[Man Over P.A.]</i>
<i>Attention all passengers.</i>

1373
01:32:54,561 --> 01:32:57,428
<i>Please get on board as soon as possible</i>...
<i>as soon as possible, please.</i>

1374
01:32:57,498 --> 01:32:59,989
- I'd like to show you how to do that sometime.
- We gotta go.

1375
01:33:00,067 --> 01:33:01,591
- Got your papers?
- What?

1376
01:33:01,668 --> 01:33:03,602
- Have you got your papers?
- They're right there.

1377
01:33:03,670 --> 01:33:05,900
Listen, darling. All we have to do
is get aboard the ship.

1378
01:33:05,973 --> 01:33:08,965
Remember, no back talk, no argument.
Just keep your temper. Promise?

1379
01:33:09,042 --> 01:33:11,237
- I promise.
- All right. Come on.

1380
01:33:11,311 --> 01:33:14,109
<i>You've been to the navy personnel.</i>
<i>They'll clear you through.</i>

1381
01:33:14,181 --> 01:33:16,081
Here's your boarding card.

1382
01:33:16,149 --> 01:33:19,277
Your orders, please, Lieutenant.
Thank you.

1383
01:33:19,353 --> 01:33:22,550
- Lieutenant Gates.
- Right.

1384
01:33:22,623 --> 01:33:24,716
- Here's your boarding card, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

1385
01:33:24,791 --> 01:33:26,725
- Surely.
- What do you want, mister?

1386
01:33:26,793 --> 01:33:31,253
- I want to go aboard.
- I'm sorry. This ship is
for war brides and a few...

1387
01:33:31,331 --> 01:33:35,461
I know. I know, Sergeant.
Here are my orders.

1388
01:33:35,536 --> 01:33:37,936
Have you got a Rochard
on your list?

1389
01:33:38,005 --> 01:33:40,565
- Yeah, a Mrs. Henri Rochard.
- That's me.

1390
01:33:40,641 --> 01:33:42,836
- You're not a woman.
- We don't want you. We want your wife.

1391
01:33:42,910 --> 01:33:45,743
You can't have my wife.
That's one thing I'm particular about.

1392
01:33:45,812 --> 01:33:48,804
- Henri.
- Oh, yes, Catherine, I'll remember.

1393
01:33:48,882 --> 01:33:52,716
There's been a slight misunderstanding,
gentlemen. My name is Henri Rochard.

1394
01:33:52,786 --> 01:33:55,311
Henri. Have you ever heard
of a woman called Henri?

1395
01:33:55,389 --> 01:33:58,119
I'm tryin' to think.
You know a lot of dames, Sam.

1396
01:33:58,191 --> 01:34:00,989
- I know a Billie.
- I don't know any. Maybe he's right.

1397
01:34:01,061 --> 01:34:03,188
- You see, I am a war bride.
- What?

1398
01:34:03,263 --> 01:34:05,424
- This is my wife.
- [Both] Oh.

1399
01:34:05,499 --> 01:34:08,491
It's a very natural mistake.
You're not the first to have made it.

1400
01:34:08,569 --> 01:34:10,628
Now, if my papers are in order,
may I go aboard?

1401
01:34:10,704 --> 01:34:13,571
I guess we'll have
to let him go on.

1402
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:16,165
- Here's your boarding card.
- Thank you. Good day.

1403
01:34:16,243 --> 01:34:18,006
- Good day.
- Good day.

1404
01:34:18,078 --> 01:34:20,012
You were wonderful, Henri.

1405
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,241
I knew if you kept your temper,
everything would be all right.

1406
01:34:22,316 --> 01:34:24,648
- I thought I behaved quite well.
- Oh, you did.

1407
01:34:24,718 --> 01:34:27,778
May I see your orders, please?

1408
01:34:27,854 --> 01:34:30,948
- Stateroom B-14, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

1409
01:34:33,660 --> 01:34:36,993
How'd you get up here? This ship is
for war brides and military personnel.

1410
01:34:37,064 --> 01:34:39,532
Yes, yes, I know.
My name is Rochard.

1411
01:34:39,600 --> 01:34:42,091
You'll think I'm a bride,
but actually, I'm a husband.

1412
01:34:42,169 --> 01:34:44,103
There'll be a moment
or two of confusion...

1413
01:34:44,171 --> 01:34:48,471
- but if we all keep our heads,
everything will be fine.
- I don't think it will.

1414
01:34:48,542 --> 01:34:51,409
- I've got a Mrs. "Rotcherd" on my list.
- Rochard!

1415
01:34:51,478 --> 01:34:54,345
She's in A-88 with two other brides
and three children.

1416
01:34:54,414 --> 01:34:58,145
- Oh, well, that, of course,
will have to be altered.
- Not by me it won't.

1417
01:34:58,218 --> 01:35:00,482
I have just explained everything
to the army.

1418
01:35:00,554 --> 01:35:02,545
They understood.
They passed me.

1419
01:35:02,623 --> 01:35:04,557
The army understood,
and they passed you.

1420
01:35:04,625 --> 01:35:06,684
Oh, that's fine.
That's just dandy.

1421
01:35:06,760 --> 01:35:09,820
Did you hear that? The army understood,
and they passed him.

1422
01:35:09,896 --> 01:35:11,830
This is the navy, bud.

1423
01:35:11,898 --> 01:35:15,527
- My friend, I have had weeks of
the United States Army, and...
- Henri.

1424
01:35:15,602 --> 01:35:18,833
And I'm quite prepared
to take on the United States Navy.

1425
01:35:18,905 --> 01:35:23,069
And the United States Navy's
quite prepared to take you on, mister.

1426
01:35:23,143 --> 01:35:25,236
Hey, fellas,
get this guy out of here.

1427
01:35:25,312 --> 01:35:27,712
Just a minute. Have you heard
of a woman called Henri?

1428
01:35:27,781 --> 01:35:31,308
Yeah. Henrietta. Powell Street.
San Francisco. Take him.

1429
01:35:31,385 --> 01:35:34,115
- No, no, no. No. Never mind. Never mind.
- Get goin'.

1430
01:35:34,187 --> 01:35:37,281
All right, I'm going.
Just go on about your business.

1431
01:35:43,497 --> 01:35:47,024
Henri, you shouldn't have lost
your temper. Where are you going?

1432
01:35:47,100 --> 01:35:49,295
I'm going someplace to change
back into a man.

1433
01:35:49,369 --> 01:35:53,135
- I'm tired of being my own wife.
- You can't give up now.

1434
01:35:53,206 --> 01:35:55,674
- Well, make them give up. Someone has to.
- Listen, will you?

1435
01:35:55,742 --> 01:35:58,836
Once on board that ship, everything
will be over, and you'll be a man forever.

1436
01:35:58,912 --> 01:36:01,244
- Now, it's worth a try, isn't it, darling?
- How can we?

1437
01:36:01,314 --> 01:36:04,181
- Well, Henri, I don't know...
- Lieutenant, would you take this bag for me?

1438
01:36:04,251 --> 01:36:08,153
- I left something on the bus.
- I'll have someone put it
in the mess hall for you.

1439
01:36:08,221 --> 01:36:10,314
- Now, what were you saying?
- Henri, do you love me?

1440
01:36:10,390 --> 01:36:13,484
- Of course I love you.
- And you'll make one more try
to get aboard that boat?

1441
01:36:13,560 --> 01:36:15,494
- If you say so.
- You promise?

1442
01:36:15,562 --> 01:36:17,496
- I promise.
- And you'll keep it?

1443
01:36:17,564 --> 01:36:19,498
- I promised, didn't I?
- All right. Come on.

1444
01:36:20,767 --> 01:36:22,860
Here. Hold these.

1445
01:36:22,936 --> 01:36:24,767
Whoa, boy. Whoa.

1446
01:36:24,838 --> 01:36:28,934
Nah, that won't do.
Oh, here's a better one here.

1447
01:36:29,009 --> 01:36:31,102
Whoa, boy. Whoa, fella.

1448
01:36:31,178 --> 01:36:33,408
- What are you doing?
- Come on, Henri. Lean down.

1449
01:36:33,480 --> 01:36:36,813
Lean down close. I wanna
see somethin'. Uh-huh. That goes perfect.

1450
01:36:36,883 --> 01:36:38,817
- With what?
- Give me your knife.

1451
01:36:38,885 --> 01:36:40,819
You're not going to...
I won't do it.

1452
01:36:40,887 --> 01:36:43,355
- This will make a perfectly good wig.
- I won't do it.

1453
01:36:43,423 --> 01:36:46,017
- And we've got the clothes right here.
- Catherine, I will not do it.

1454
01:36:46,093 --> 01:36:48,357
- But, Henri, you said you loved me.
- Well, I'm not so sure now.

1455
01:36:48,428 --> 01:36:51,920
- And you promised. Give me your knife.
- <i>[Ship Whistle Blows]</i>

1456
01:36:51,998 --> 01:36:55,092
Come on, Henri.
There's not much time.

1457
01:36:57,471 --> 01:37:00,463
This is ridiculous.

1458
01:37:00,540 --> 01:37:03,407
Catherine, can't you at least
cut it off the mane?

1459
01:37:03,477 --> 01:37:05,604
Henri, you're taking this
much too personally.

1460
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:09,115
Now, stand so no one
can see what I'm doing.

1461
01:37:25,432 --> 01:37:27,627
Mmm, a little tough.

1462
01:37:28,935 --> 01:37:32,393
Hmm. Won't be so bad
when I get your bangs rolled.

1463
01:37:32,472 --> 01:37:34,906
Wanna see what you look like?

1464
01:37:37,077 --> 01:37:39,011
Horrible.

1465
01:37:39,079 --> 01:37:41,547
I don't think I'll be called
upon to defend my honor.

1466
01:37:41,615 --> 01:37:44,106
- I doubt it.
- It's a pity.

1467
01:37:44,184 --> 01:37:47,278
- I wonder if some lipstick would help.
- Oh, no.

1468
01:37:47,354 --> 01:37:50,812
- Well, why not?
- I'm more the outdoor type.

Sea Biscuit. Bang Tail.
You know?

Oh, silly, hold still.
Let me roll these.

1471
01:38:06,706 --> 01:38:09,504
Oh, wait a minute. I forgot somethin'.
Can you talk like a woman?

1472
01:38:09,576 --> 01:38:12,136
- [High-pitched] You mean like this?
- Can't you do better than that?

1473
01:38:12,212 --> 01:38:15,340
- [Own Voice] No.
- Just remember... Keep your
mouth closed. Not a word.

1474
01:38:15,415 --> 01:38:18,748
Leave everything to me.
And keep your head down.

1475

Oh, sailor, would you put this
in the mess hall for me, please?

1476
01:38:24,825 --> 01:38:26,884
- Sure, Lieutenant.
- Thank you.

Hey, did you hear that?
I must look pretty good.

1479
01:38:34,634 --> 01:38:36,761
- Don't be silly. That was for me.
- For you?

1480
01:38:36,837 --> 01:38:38,805
- Of course.
- I ought to punch him in the nose.

1481
01:38:38,872 --> 01:38:42,672
- Henri, remember, you're a lady.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

1482
01:38:47,647 --> 01:38:51,913
- We have our boarding cards.
We've been up before.
- Go ahead.

1483
01:38:55,021 --> 01:38:57,114
I don't remember
that tall one, Sam.

1484
01:38:57,190 --> 01:39:01,092
- It's hard to believe you could
forget a face like that.
- Yeah.

1485
01:39:02,662 --> 01:39:05,153
Lieutenant Gates. B-14.
I was up before.

1486
01:39:05,232 --> 01:39:08,065
Oh, yes. Your orders, please.

1487
01:39:09,669 --> 01:39:12,661
Say, that's funny. Rochard.

1488
01:39:12,739 --> 01:39:15,139
Why aren't you listed among
the military personnel, Lieutenant?

1489
01:39:15,208 --> 01:39:18,143
Save your voice. You'll have to
excuse her. She has laryngitis.

1490
01:39:18,211 --> 01:39:21,203
- Now, what were you saying?
- Why isn't the lieutenant
listed among military personnel?

1491
01:39:21,281 --> 01:39:24,808
- Well, you see, she was just married.
- Married? That may be, but...

1492
01:39:24,885 --> 01:39:27,979
Hey, Red. Come here.

1493
01:39:28,054 --> 01:39:32,753
- What's the trouble?
- This lieutenant is listed as a missus.

1494
01:39:32,826 --> 01:39:35,920
Why'd they put you
down as mi...

1495
01:39:35,996 --> 01:39:38,931
How do you do?

1496
01:39:38,999 --> 01:39:43,129
- Why'd they put you down as
missus instead of lieutenant?
- She has laryngitis.

1497
01:39:43,203 --> 01:39:46,195
They possibly didn't list her
as lieutenant because of her husband.

1498
01:39:46,273 --> 01:39:48,935
- Who'd she marry?
- Admiral Rochard.

1499
01:39:49,009 --> 01:39:51,443
- Who?
- Admiral Rochard.

1500
01:39:51,511 --> 01:39:54,139
The name is familiar, but I don't remember it
connected with an admiral.

1501
01:39:54,214 --> 01:39:56,705
You never heard of her husband?
He won't like that.

1502
01:39:56,783 --> 01:39:58,842
Florence, if I were you,
I wouldn't say a word about this.

1503
01:39:58,919 --> 01:40:01,649
Sure. You heard of him, Red.
Admiral Rochard. Sure.

1504
01:40:01,721 --> 01:40:04,087
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Maybe I have. All right.

1505
01:40:04,157 --> 01:40:07,320
- Stateroom A-88, Lieutenant.
- Get your instructions in the mess hall.

1506
01:40:07,394 --> 01:40:10,192
Thanks so much.
Come, Florence.

1507
01:40:15,068 --> 01:40:17,832
First time I ever felt sorry
for an admiral.

1508
01:40:17,904 --> 01:40:19,997
Gams aren't bad.

1509
01:40:20,073 --> 01:40:23,338
Now I'm beginning
to feel sorry for you.

1510
01:40:26,913 --> 01:40:29,040
- In here, please.
- We were just going...

1511
01:40:29,115 --> 01:40:33,313
- Please, Lieutenant. Your instructions first.
- Come on, Florence.

1512
01:40:34,788 --> 01:40:37,951
- I don't like that name Florence.
- Oh, shut up.

1513
01:40:38,992 --> 01:40:40,926
- Kitty.
- I've been waiting...

1514
01:40:40,994 --> 01:40:43,792
- Shh.
- Oh, no.

1515
01:40:43,863 --> 01:40:46,263
Stand on the other side
so they can't see so well.

1516
01:40:46,333 --> 01:40:49,166
This was the only way.
They wouldn't let him... Henri, duck down.

1517
01:40:49,235 --> 01:40:51,795
- I can hear quite well.
- You're too tall. Duck down.

1518
01:40:51,871 --> 01:40:54,499
- He looks awful.
- I didn't have much to work with.

1519
01:40:54,574 --> 01:40:57,270
I don't see how I could get him aboard.
You got a room where we can put him?

1520
01:40:57,344 --> 01:40:59,437
I've got a room, but they wouldn't
let a thing like that in.

1521
01:40:59,512 --> 01:41:02,208
We gotta hide him somewhere till we can
change his clothes and the boat sails.

1522
01:41:02,282 --> 01:41:04,807
- What about the linen...
- No, and the men's room won't do either.

1523
01:41:04,884 --> 01:41:07,011
- Somebody's spotted him already.
- What?

1524
01:41:07,087 --> 01:41:11,456
We need a nurse. It's an emergency.
Will you come with me, please?

1525
01:41:11,524 --> 01:41:14,493
- I'm a nurse?
- Come along, please.

1526
01:41:14,561 --> 01:41:16,495
I hadn't counted on this.

1530
01:41:35,915 --> 01:41:40,579
- No. It isn't a very convenient time, is it?
- You can say that again.

1531
01:41:40,653 --> 01:41:43,520
- It isn't a very convenient time, is it?
- No. No, it isn't.

01:41:43,590 --> 01:41:46,889
No. Oh, gee. I wonder if the baby
will be a girl.

Oh, you're very kind.

Gosh, l... I wish I knew
what was going on in there.

Mr. Rochard, may we come in?

I don't see how I can stop you.

Thank you. Henri, this is Lieutenant Perkins

The commander's the chaplain.

01:43:31,064 --> 01:43:34,227
Chaplain? Oh, no, no.
No, nothin' doing. I'm sorry, Chaplain.

1556
01:43:34,300 --> 01:43:37,064
- Nothing doing what?
- No more marriages. It isn't worth it.

1557
01:43:37,137 --> 01:43:39,628
- I'm not gonna marry her again, Chaplain.
- Why, Henri.

1558
01:43:39,706 --> 01:43:43,540
I don't think that'll be necessary.
We've got the whole thing straightened out.

I'm sorry about the mix-up, sir,

- Yes, and under the circumstances...

You're free. You can go now.

- Anywhere on the ship.

We've got you bunked in with one
of the officers. He doesn't mind.

01:44:06,499 --> 01:44:09,559
I think he would mind.
He wouldn't like that at all.

- You see, I snore terribly.
- Why, Henri, you don't snore.

1569
01:44:12,839 --> 01:44:14,773
- How would you know I don't?
- Oh.

01:44:14,841 --> 01:44:18,902
Couldn't we do something simple?
Couldn't I just stay here?

Well, thank you. That's very nice.

01:44:28,021 --> 01:44:30,216
All right.

1575
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:35,551
Mm-hmm.

1576
01:44:43,770 --> 01:44:47,331
- You wouldn't.
- Yes, I would.

1577
01:44:47,407 --> 01:44:49,739
I believe you would.

1578
01:44:53,346 --> 01:44:56,509
Henri, how will we ever
get out of here?

1579
01:44:56,583 --> 01:45:01,953
I'm not gonna worry about that until
the Statue of Liberty goes by that porthole.
