25.000

2
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,240
Do not hate a weak child,

3
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,640
it may be the son of a tiger!

00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:43,520
TUNGUS KINGDOM

THE YEAR OF THE BLACK RAT

6
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:31,280
a film by Sergei Bodrov Sr

7
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:38,120
Mongol

8
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,840
The monk you've sent
to find your wife is dead.

9
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,480
Do you hear me?

10
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,040
Tungus steppe,
20 years earlier.

11
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:27,720
When I was 9, my father was taking
me to the merkits to find a bride.

12
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:36,160
Some time ago he stole from them my
mother and they have not forgotten that.

13
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,000
Now my father had
to make peace with them.

14
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,800
So he decided to marry me off to a merkit.

15
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:53,440
I could not refuse.

16
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,480
Here lives my friend Dai-Sechen.
We'll sleep over his place.

17
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,800
Welcome, my friend Esugei!

18
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,040
I am glad to see you.

19
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,440
Your son has grown.
Please come in.

20
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,240
What's your name?
- Temujin.

21
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,600
I should be the one to ask first you know.

22
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,920
How old are you?

23
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,520
Nine.

24
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,480
You're younger than me.

25
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,200
By how much?

26
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,880
By one year.

27
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:11,120
Why have you come?

28
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,200
I'm going over to the merkits to find a bride.
We decided to sleep over here.

29
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,600
Wise people come to
our clan, to choose brides.

30
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
Goodbye Temujin.

31
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,120
Wait! What's your name?
- Borte.

32
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,920
Temujin,
it's me you should chose!

33
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,560
Well Done!

34
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,320
Let’s wrestle Targutay!
I'm drunk and you'll beat me.

35
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,600
You're not only stupid,
but you're weak too!

36
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,680
Mosquitoes here are vicious.

37
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,200
I want to choose a bride from here.

38
00:05:55,800 --> 00:06:01,240
Why would you do that?
This clan is weak.

39
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,920
Wise people come here to find brides.

40
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:10,720
I have to make my peace with the merkits.

41
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,680
I'll just give it a go.

42
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,080
They'll be Insulted if you don’t choose

43
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,240
If their clan is weak,
let them be insulted.

44
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,600
Remember what
I am about to tell you now!

45
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,360
It is important not to go wrong
ànd chose your bride correctly.

46
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,520
Her face should be flat
like the surface of the salt lake.

47
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,760
And the eyes narrow.

48
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,120
Evil spirits dive in
wide eyes and she goes mad.

49
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,800
She will not see
what is for real.

50
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,880
And most important: don't forget
to look at their feet.

51
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,480
The stronger
women’s' feet are,

52
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,640
the bigger the pleasure
the man gets. Got it?

53
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,080
You will be my bride.
- I will.

54
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,320
I've chosen my bride.

55
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,680
For her, I'll give you a sable skin coat.

56
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,440
Your son did the right choice.

57
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:14,800
Right or not, time will tell.
We can go on our way now.

58
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,160
You are right. This is
a great honor for my clan.

59
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:24,520
They can get wed in 5 years.

60
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,040
This is a white crow' bone. If you rub
it any whish of yours comes true.

61
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,560
I'll be back in 5 years.

62
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,080
Why didn't you listen to me?

63
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,960
You're stubborn
and did it all your way.

64
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,000
I saw her and I immediately
knew she is my bride.

65
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,520
What am I to say to the merkits now?
They wont forgive me this.

66
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:03,160
Oh well,
be what it may.

67
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,000
We were going home,

68
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,520
and my father was silent.

69
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:21,400
Finally he told me:
You did right.

70
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,760
A man should choose his bride himself.

71
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:36,160
I didn't know this day
will change my life forever.

72
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,480
Are you afraid?

73
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,440
Yes.

74
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,280
When there's thunder
it means god Tengri is angered.

75
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,600
That's why all Mongols
are afraid of thunder.

76
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,040
Enemies!

77
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:44,240
So what?! Blood should not be
spilled in a resting camp.

78
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:11,760
Please accept this milk from my master
- Thank you. Have a seat

79
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,160
Thank you.

80
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:42,320
Esugei, let the servant drink first.

81
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,200
Look at how they stare at us.

82
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,680
They are our enemies.

83
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:57,520
But if I Knan Esugei
break the custom,

84
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,360
the world will turn up side down.

85
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:31,720
You're not well Esugei,
let’s stop.

86
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,440
Shut your mouth
You can’t decide.

87
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,680
They poisoned our khan!

88
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,320
Scum!

89
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,080
I'm leaving you son.
You are the khan now.

90
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,120
Be strong!

91
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:39,280
And pray to our god, the master
of the blue sky- the almighty Tengri,

92
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,600
and he will help you...

93
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,000
Take everything!

94
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:35,800
Don’t you dare!
That's the khans' stud!

95
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,280
He protected you!
Go away!

96
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:56,640
You're ungrateful

97
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:03,640
Why aren’t you afraid Tarugai?

98
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,800
Khan Esugei is dead.

99
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:11,520
My son is khan now
He'll take his vengeance on you!

100
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,760
You wish for his death?

101
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:27,400
Run! Quick!
- Get him!

102
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:46,720
What madness got
into you Tarugai?!

103
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:54,000
Why do you break our custom?
Mongols don’t kill children!

104
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,280
Be damned Tarugai!
You and the filthy barrows of your dead!

105
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:19,120
Like Esugei used to say:
"Never break the custom,

106
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,200
even if you really want to."

107
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:24,680
I'll kill him when he grows up.

108
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,200
Tarugai!

109
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,640
Tell the people
I don’t want to be khan.

110
00:16:53,200 --> 00:16:56,760
You dog! Everyone
has forgotten you already.

111
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,680
So why kill me?
- So I could sleep easy.

112
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,040
I'll kill you!

113
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:12,160
I'll kill you first.
Scum!

114
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:39,920
You have to be strong!
Eat!

115
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,440
Drink.

116
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,840
Those flies suck your blood.

117
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,080
Temujin!

118
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,360
Your clan left.
Don’t worry about them.

119
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,400
Jamuha, brother,
find my bride.

120
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,560
Tell her to wait for me.

121
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,080
He's still small.

122
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:30,320
Give him more food!
I want him grown when I'm back.

123
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:59,680
Almighty Tengri, master
of the blue sky! I am Temujin.

124
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,560
If you hear me,
help me!

125
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,400
That winter I couldn't
 go back home.

126
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,920
The one who
could help me,

127
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:19,240
was my brother Jamuha.

128
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,680
It was a long way,
but I had no other choice.

129
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:30,520
I knew they were looking for me,
so they could kill me.

130
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,800
1186
the year of the Fiery Horse.

131
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,520
I survived because our
god Tengri didn't abandon me.

132
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:28,480
I was ready now to
face my enemies.

133
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:33,120
But first I had to find
My bride Borte.

134
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:38,600
And then I would take back
what was mine.

135
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,880
I thought you were dead.

136
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,520
I live...
You know why I came.

137
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,720
It's been many years.

138
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,440
I don’t know if she
would agree to be with you.

139
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,680
My Temujin came back.

140
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,200
Father,
I have to leave with Temujin.

141
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,480
Bring the sable skin coat.

142
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:25,560
Why won’t you
touch me Temujin?

143
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,000
I fear suffocating you.

144
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:45,560
My son!
Temujin!

145
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:03,680
I like you.
You're strong like I am.

146
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:09,000
You're good and kind.

147
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:18,760
This is my dowry.

148
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,080
It's too expensive for me.

149
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,480
This is for you.

150
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:58,040
Brother, when will you raise your yurt?

151
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,760
Tomorrow.

152
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,040
It's good my brother came back.
And with a beautiful wife too.

153
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:36,440
Got you!
- Because I wished it.

154
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,960
I will be a good wife.

155
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,680
I know.

156
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,560
Stay here!

157
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,760
Oelun!

158
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,160
Chilidu!

159
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:08,840
You knew my voice?

160
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,520
Women don’t forget the first man.

161
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,840
Hey, come down! 
I want to look at you.

162
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,840
Why would I want to
look at you old crone?

163
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,040
I need your daughter-in-law.

164
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,560
Get lost!

165
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,960
They're not here
Be gone!

166
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,560
Shut up!

167
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,440
Hasar!
Watch out!

168
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:58,440
Where are they?
Speak!

169
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,160
I found their tracks

170
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:15,800
Temujin!
I waited so long for you.

171
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:20,120
Many times
I rubbed this bone.

172
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:23,680
I had one wish only -
your return

173
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,000
I want always to be with you
Temujin.

174
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,160
I promise you that.

175
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,560
Merkits!

176
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,000
Go home!

177
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:18,320
When Temujins' father
stole my bride,

178
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,240
I swore revenge.

179
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,080
Now you're mine!

180
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,000
Take her!

181
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,960
My son!

182
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,480
Brother!

183
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:56,160
What have they done to you?

184
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:23,080
Hello Jamuha, brother!

185
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:33,840
I am glad you're alive brother.

186
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,360
Take this gift my brother.

187
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:05,440
When I learned the
merkits stole your wife,

188
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:08,240
I felt sick in my liver.

189
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:12,360
I want to talk to you.

190
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:24,200
Mongols do not war because of women

191
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,880
I'll tell Taichar
to give two new women.

192
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:34,200
I need Borte.

193
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:42,120
Have you tried
no other besides her?

194
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:47,320
Dou you think
only her legs are strong?

195
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,840
I haven’t got much time.

196
00:34:06,840 --> 00:34:09,040
Greet him!

197
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:18,760
Taichar, the merkits
insulted my brother

198
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,640
How many riders can you rally?

199
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,160
I'll fight and
I'll rally others.

200
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,840
It's not enough, brother.

201
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,640
I know that.
That's why I came to you.

202
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,360
Fine, I'll help you.

203
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:18,760
We'll go next year.

204
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:21,000
Why next year?

205
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:26,680
Next year will be
better for war.

206
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,320
We'll wait.

207
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:40,680
Just don’t tell anyone
you started a war because of a woman.

208
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,640
These are merkits' lands.

209
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:07,240
Who are you?

210
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,640
I knew you would come.

211
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:29,720
Borte, I can’t live without you!

212
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,880
This is my son.

213
00:40:58,480 --> 00:40:59,920
I can see that.

214
00:41:44,720 --> 00:41:47,360
Are you happy you
got your wife back?

215
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,560
I would be afraid
to sleep with such like her

216
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,920
And you're brave.

217
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,200
He is too brave.

218
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:24,400
I would like to thank you brother.

219
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:28,040
You will stay with me.

220
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,720
I'm used to be my own master.

221
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,040
You don’t know the Mongols.
You will perish alone.

222
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,560
I'll make you my second.

223
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:50,360
Temujin, your men await you.

224
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:53,760
I have to go.
- Go.

225
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:09,160
Temujin, this sword is for you.
It's the best one of the lot.

226
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:14,280
Jamuha took for himself
the largest cut of the booty.

227
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,120
How shall we divide the rest?

228
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:24,240
I'll take one tenth,

229
00:43:24,720 --> 00:43:26,720
divide the rest between the solders.

230
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,520
Don’t forget the families of the fallen.

231
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:35,600
You take the sword
- Thank you Temujin.

232
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:41,680
Hey, Temujin shares
the booty with us!

233
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,720
Everyone will get a cut.

234
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,600
Look at him!
He gave the booty away.

235
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:04,440
Next time he'll keep
everything for himself.

236
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,360
He took another' seed
in his own yurt.

237
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:10,760
Don’t talk ill of my brother.

238
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,480
What brother of yours is he?
I'm your brother.

239
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:42,320
One can’t boil two
lamb heads in one couldrum.

240
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,280
So they say.

241
00:45:51,600 --> 00:45:53,080
Get up!

242
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:09,360
My Brother left.
He's stubborn!

243
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,000
Stop rolling on the ground!

244
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:23,680
Daritai!
Altan!

245
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,000
Taichar!

246
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:41,320
Where is Daritai?
where is Altan?

247
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:48,240
They should be
where my boots are.

248
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:51,480
They left with Temujin.

249
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,160
What?

250
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,960
They left with Temujin.

251
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:35,480
Brother,
you didn't say goodbye.

252
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,840
I wanted to,
but you was fast asleep, brother.

253
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:44,920
Why did my men leave with you?

254
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,200
You know the law.

255
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,400
Mongols can change their
master if they wish to.

256
00:47:57,120 --> 00:48:00,240
Daritai, Altan!

257
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:03,880
Why did you abandon me?

258
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:08,240
Temujin is Just.

259
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:10,240
Give us back our horses!

260
00:48:10,520 --> 00:48:13,160
You gave that horse to me,
so now he is mine.

261
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:19,640
Daritai, I am your master.

262
00:48:20,680 --> 00:48:23,520
If I want to, I could
rip your rotten liver out.

263
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,840
Try it!

264
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,400
My liver has a
new master now.

265
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,520
I can’t give them back to you brother.

266
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:49,360
Mongols chose for themselves.

267
00:49:13,680 --> 00:49:16,720
Keep an eye on your horse.
I'll come to take it back.

268
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,720
Daritai, they're taking our horses!

269
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:23,760
Jamuhas' men tried
to take away your herd.

270
00:50:28,560 --> 00:50:31,000
One of them was killed.

271
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:34,680
One thief less !

272
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:42,400
We killed Jamujas'
brother- Taichar.

273
00:50:44,440 --> 00:50:46,320
Who killed him?

274
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:52,320
I did. I didn't recognize him.

275
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:58,480
You saved our horses,
but brought war on us.

276
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:05,640
Forgive me master!
Send my head to Jamuha.

277
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:18,000
He kept watch on the herd.

278
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:22,480
What will people say
if you give him away?

279
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,000
I learned of your sorrow Jamuha.

280
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:13,360
I want to help you
get revenge.

281
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,080
I want to tie Temujin's
head to the tail of my horse.

282
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:29,680
Off you go and do it then!

283
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:38,520
Without you I can't do it.

284
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,480
Afraid, are you Tarugai?

285
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,600
Are you a Khan or not?

286
00:52:59,920 --> 00:53:02,640
There's only two strong
Mongols in the steppe-

287
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:09,040
Me and my brother Temujin.

288
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,920
Do you understand?

289
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:19,040
I'll bring all my warriors.
Will you give Temujin over to me?

290
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:10,240
Temujin, Jamuha is chasing us.

291
00:54:11,280 --> 00:54:15,080
They outnumber us 10 times.
What shall we do?

292
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,000
I will not abandon our families.

293
00:54:18,440 --> 00:54:23,160
If we survive we'll get back for them.
We haven't other choice.

294
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,360
Altan, Daritai,
you entrusted your families to me.

295
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:33,960
Jamuha will not spare their lives.
Are you ready to let them go?

296
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,160
You decide Temujin.

297
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:49,160
Leave us. Save yourself!

298
00:54:52,040 --> 00:54:54,480
Do what Mongols
always do.

299
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,080
Everyone will understand.

300
00:54:57,440 --> 00:54:59,200
I won’t understand it.

301
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,680
Onward, to the mountain!
Quick!

302
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,640
What are you waiting Jamuha?

303
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:26,920
Why should I hurry?

304
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,440
Temujin will get away.
We'll not find him afterwards.

305
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,200
You don’t' know my brother.

306
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,160
Are you ready?
- We're ready.

307
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,120
Hasar!

308
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:19,640
Get some warriors to protect
the women and children.

309
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,120
We will stay with you Temujin.

310
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,880
It is time for you to go.

311
00:57:19,840 --> 00:57:22,480
Take care of yourself and our son.

312
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:25,560
Stay alive Temujin!

313
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:41,320
Remember us!

314
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:48,280
Do you see what my brother is like?

315
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:51,600
You will not take over him easily.

316
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:07,240
Charge!

317
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:58,240
I want him alive!

318
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,880
Me too!

319
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,080
You promised him to me.
He's mine!

320
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:07,120
Everything here is mine Tarugai.
Now you are mine too.

321
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:39,800
You are quiet.

322
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:48,320
You don't beg for mercy.

323
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:54,080
Do you want to die Temujin?

324
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:04,280
I am not in the habit to whimper brother.

325
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:11,880
Beg for mercy!

326
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:16,760
I can not.

327
01:03:21,120 --> 01:03:23,360
I beg you!

328
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,480
Forgive me brother!

329
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:35,320
I am not your brother.

330
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:40,080
I am your Khan now.

331
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:48,200
And you are my slave.

332
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:54,200
Take him!

333
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,200
Hold on!

334
01:04:31,560 --> 01:04:33,080
I can't.

335
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:40,120
I fought badly.

336
01:04:43,160 --> 01:04:45,520
You fought well Temujin.

337
01:04:46,160 --> 01:04:48,160
You saved our families.

338
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:52,800
All Mongols will now
remember you forever.

339
01:05:19,160 --> 01:05:20,920
Get up!

340
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:26,040
Go and lift him up!

341
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,920
That is the end of me.

342
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:50,400
Tunguska border town.
One year later.

343
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:12,240
Good day, Master.

344
01:06:12,520 --> 01:06:14,120
Stop!

345
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,080
Do you want to buy slaves?

346
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,120
How much do you want for them?

347
01:06:21,040 --> 01:06:23,080
One brace of Tungus money.

348
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:25,680
Two for this one.

349
01:06:33,560 --> 01:06:35,920
And five for this one.

350
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:38,680
It's too much!
I'll give you three.

351
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:44,920
Can't do for less.
He killed my best guard.

352
01:06:47,440 --> 01:06:50,440
Don’t buy him!
He will bring us great misfortune.

353
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:54,480
What misfortune could a slave bring?
We have thousands.

354
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:00,080
He is a warrior. He’ll never
forgive you the humiliation.

355
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:01,440
Forget about him!

356
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:03,960
What are you babbling about old man?!

357
01:07:05,120 --> 01:07:07,920
He is a slave, and he will die a slave.

358
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,240
I see thousands Mongol riders,

359
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:16,360
ruining your land.
And death.

360
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:26,800
Hey, Mongol! Do you want
to ruin our kingdom?

361
01:07:34,880 --> 01:07:37,440
I know what to do with him.

362
01:08:16,280 --> 01:08:18,840
We haven't been paid in half a year.

363
01:08:21,760 --> 01:08:24,040
Let’s sell this beast.

364
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,560
Who will buy him?

365
01:09:14,080 --> 01:09:17,360
Hey, Mongol!
Show us your teeth!

366
01:09:19,120 --> 01:09:22,960
The Mongol who wanted to
destroy the Tungus Kingdom.

367
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,800
Forgive us!

368
01:09:59,680 --> 01:10:03,400
I know that
die in a cage.

369
01:10:04,240 --> 01:10:06,320
I live.

370
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:10,920
You have a strong spirit.

371
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:13,800
I came to beg you.

372
01:10:14,720 --> 01:10:20,440
When the time of terror comes,
dont destroy the monastery.

373
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:25,680
Kill the guards during the night...

374
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,840
...and give me the key to the cage.

375
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,400
My faith does not
allow me to kill.

376
01:10:35,400 --> 01:10:37,440
Mine does.

377
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:44,960
There are sacred books in the monastery.
They must be preserved.

378
01:10:47,240 --> 01:10:49,400
I can't read.

379
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:57,720
Go to the Mongol
slave merchants.

380
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:01,800
Let them find Temujins' clan
and give this bone to Borte.

381
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,880
Remember - Borte.

382
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:18,000
I promise!

383
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:24,000
Everyone is being robed in the Mongol steppe.

384
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:28,840
From our merchants only
only the Golden Earring goes there.

385
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:31,040
He is a brigand himself.

386
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,480
And nobody knows
when will he show up.

387
01:11:40,480 --> 01:11:43,840
No one will help you
old monk.

388
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,000
Jochi, Jochi!

389
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:31,120
We have to go.

390
01:14:52,560 --> 01:14:55,280
I know how monks are buried.

391
01:15:02,680 --> 01:15:06,560
And what is it you're waiting for?
- A caravan

392
01:15:07,160 --> 01:15:09,640
This is the last caravan.

393
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,720
I won’t be back soon.

394
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:24,440
Take us with you!

395
01:15:28,120 --> 01:15:31,720
It's a long trip and
I see you haven't got money

396
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:43,560
How will you repay me?
- You know how.

397
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:37,480
It is not enough.
- We had a deal.

398
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:45,360
He wants more or he'll give us away.
- I don’t have more money.

399
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:51,040
You don’t have appearance of a poor woman.

400
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:58,400
Hey, wait!

401
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:02,160
I want to talk.

402
01:19:04,480 --> 01:19:07,000
Move and I'll kill you!

403
01:19:08,560 --> 01:19:10,680
Give me the key!

404
01:20:30,680 --> 01:20:32,480
What's her name?

405
01:20:33,120 --> 01:20:35,040
Mungan.

406
01:20:38,960 --> 01:20:41,960
I am your father Mungan.

407
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:50,440
So where is our other father?

408
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:53,960
Talk of him no more.
He is your father.

409
01:22:12,480 --> 01:22:14,600
Go to sleep already!

410
01:23:36,480 --> 01:23:39,280
Don’t be afraid!
He is our father.

411
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,840
Do you want to play too?

412
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,480
Dad,
why don't you plait your hair?

413
01:25:07,680 --> 01:25:10,360
A Mongol should
plait his hair in braids.

414
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:14,040
I am an exception.

415
01:25:27,720 --> 01:25:30,520
This is meat.
- Meat.

416
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:40,440
Our language is the most beautiful.

417
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:46,680
Everyone will talk
Mongolian one day.

418
01:25:47,880 --> 01:25:50,920
Hear how beautiful it sounds:
Meat!

419
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:10,320
Jochi, how old are you?
- I am 10 dad.

420
01:26:11,040 --> 01:26:13,520
It is time for you to choose a bride.

421
01:26:15,240 --> 01:26:17,000
How should I choose?

422
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:23,280
I'll teach you. Finding
a bride is the most difficult thing.

423
01:26:23,400 --> 01:26:24,840
I agree.

424
01:26:29,280 --> 01:26:34,840
I told you he is not scary.
- Yes, our father is very funny.

425
01:26:43,680 --> 01:26:47,360
I came up with the names of the
sons you will bear to me.

426
01:26:49,920 --> 01:26:52,800
You have forgotten
what Mongols are like.

427
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:57,080
I have not,
I am a Mongol myself.

428
01:26:59,680 --> 01:27:03,200
They are worse now.
They kill, plunder,

429
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,560
and have no mercy on children.

430
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:22,240
I know what to do with the Mongols.

431
01:27:30,400 --> 01:27:33,080
Take the children and go home!

432
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:46,040
When will you be back?
In a year, in two?

433
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:58,160
It will be long before
I see you again Temujin...

434
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:39,440
Almighty Tengri,
master of the blue sky!

435
01:28:40,240 --> 01:28:43,600
Give me the strength
to carry out what I plan.

436
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:09,440
Mongols need laws that
will unite them in a tight knot.

437
01:29:09,720 --> 01:29:13,800
For the pillaging to stop and
mothers to want to bear children.

438
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:18,240
The mongol punishment
will be one - DEATH!

439
01:29:35,760 --> 01:29:40,560
To the one to raise a sword
on children or women - DEATH!

440
01:29:41,400 --> 01:29:46,200
To the one who refuses a traveler
food and shelter - DEATH!

441
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:52,400
To the one who buys stolen goods -
DEATH!

442
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,040
To the one who kills a messenger -
DEATH!

443
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,200
1196
The year of The Red Dragon

444
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:05,280
To the one who throws down his weapon
during a fight - DEATH!

445
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:10,280
Death to him and
ten of his comrades.

446
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:17,400
Should ten run away,
death to one hundred!

447
01:30:23,440 --> 01:30:25,680
Should a thousand run away,

448
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:29,360
death to all Mongols!

449
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:36,640
And the Mongols agreed to
my laws, but Jamuha did not.

450
01:30:57,560 --> 01:31:00,840
Jamuhas' army is more numerous,

451
01:31:01,040 --> 01:31:03,880
but I know how to win the battle.

452
01:31:06,800 --> 01:31:11,160
Tengri, hear my prayer!

453
01:31:12,480 --> 01:31:14,840
But not the one of my enemy.

454
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:42,120
My brothers' soldiers are good shots.

455
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,600
It is time to attack Jamuha.

456
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:58,040
My brother is as cunning as a wolf.

457
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:07,360
Send one squad first.

458
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:18,560
Temujin, we throw at your feet
the body of our khan.

459
01:39:18,680 --> 01:39:21,120
He tried to run,
but we killed him!

460
01:39:22,160 --> 01:39:25,560
Who is he?
- Your enemy Tarugai.

461
01:39:36,000 --> 01:39:38,800
Kill them!
- What for?

462
01:39:42,480 --> 01:39:45,920
Altan, don't kill us!

463
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:50,960
You broke the law.
You betraied your khan!

464
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,480
We didn't know...

465
01:40:04,520 --> 01:40:06,520
Hello, old man!

466
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:12,120
Thank you for remembering
me Khan Temujin.

467
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:19,400
Give him a herd of horses!
And a yurt next to mine.

468
01:40:26,200 --> 01:40:29,680
And accept all those men
into my army.

469
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:34,360
Temujin, we captured him.

470
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:54,680
Temujin...

471
01:40:55,440 --> 01:41:01,200
You are the khan now and I'm
kneeling before you. Are you happy now?

472
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:15,120
I can forget everything brother.
- It is too late.

473
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:24,280
I don’t want to be the
pebble in your boot.

474
01:41:30,280 --> 01:41:35,400
Tell me: All Mongols are
afraid of storms,

475
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:40,560
why aren't you?
Why?

476
01:41:45,680 --> 01:41:48,400
There was no place for me to hide.

477
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:53,960
So I stopped being afraid.

478
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:07,840
What are you going to do with me,
Temujin?

479
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:12,480
What would you do?

480
01:42:15,280 --> 01:42:17,840
I would kill you, brother.

481
01:42:35,120 --> 01:42:37,440
You are free.

482
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:49,880
You are letting your enemy go free!

483
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:55,240
I'm letting my brother free.

484
01:43:04,720 --> 01:43:06,080
Dad,

485
01:43:08,320 --> 01:43:12,280
when do we go to find a bride?
You promised!

486
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:16,200
So I did,
and we'll go.

487
01:43:28,800 --> 01:43:31,880
Look at what a beautiful
mother I chose for you!

488
01:43:32,400 --> 01:43:34,720
I chose you, Temujin...

489
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:43,920
Yes, that's true...

490
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:10,560
I have to finish,
what I started.

491
01:44:20,680 --> 01:44:23,200
You are a good wife, Borte.

492
01:44:35,440 --> 01:44:39,120
You know I will
always keep coming back...

493
01:44:53,160 --> 01:44:57,080
Old man, tell me what will happen!

494
01:44:57,600 --> 01:45:00,240
Don’t fear, I can listen .

495
01:45:14,840 --> 01:45:19,360
You know what will happen,
Great Khan!

496
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,840
1206
The year of The Red Tiger

497
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:33,920
Temujin was acknowledged
as ruler of all Mongols.

498
01:45:38,520 --> 01:45:41,400
Genghis Khan of the great steppe.

499
01:45:41,680 --> 01:45:44,320
He conquered half the world.

500
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:49,640
The Tungus Kingdom was erased
from the face of the earth.

501
01:45:50,400 --> 01:45:54,000
But the monastery was preserved.

502
01:45:57,400 --> 01:46:00,680
