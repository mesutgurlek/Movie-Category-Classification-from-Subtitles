1
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:13,057
(Music)

2
00:00:14,778 --> 00:00:17,278
Anonyma

3
00:00:24,447 --> 00:00:28,338
A Woman in Berlin

4
00:00:33,181 --> 00:00:36,014
(woman's voice)
Who would've thought that?

5
00:00:37,021 --> 00:00:40,616
On April 16th 1945 the time had come.

6
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:45,019
The Russian army had surrounded Berlin

7
00:00:45,119 --> 00:00:47,818
and now they were heading
towards the Reichstag.

8
00:00:49,901 --> 00:00:54,019
On this day,
you could see the sun behind the clouds,

9
00:00:54,141 --> 00:00:58,100
and the smell of lilac
wafted through all the smoke.

10
00:01:02,181 --> 00:01:04,741
How to start?

11
00:01:04,861 --> 00:01:07,819
How to find the right words?

12
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:13,018
I've been a journalist,
I've traveled 12 countries.

13
00:01:13,141 --> 00:01:15,356
Been living in Moscow,
Paris and London.

14
00:01:15,357 --> 00:01:17,737
I really liked to stay
in Paris and London.

15
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:23,976
I decided to come back.
I wanted to be part of it.

16
00:01:28,181 --> 00:01:31,059
My name doesn't matter.

17
00:01:31,181 --> 00:01:35,174
I am one of the many who fervently
believed in our country's future.

18
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:38,899
Doubts?
Only weak persons had doubts.

19
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:41,363
(Gerd) Warsaw, Brussels, Paris.
We're always winning.

20
00:01:41,364 --> 00:01:43,856
The Russians don't have a leader.

21
00:01:43,981 --> 00:01:45,856
When they finally come to their senses,

22
00:01:45,857 --> 00:01:48,452
we are already knocking at
their front door in Moscow.

23
00:01:50,661 --> 00:01:54,540
Pardon our pushiness,
but it's war after all.

24
00:01:54,661 --> 00:01:56,195
Gerd hated railway stations.

25
00:01:56,196 --> 00:01:59,098
When he left, the sound of
his boots filled the house.

26
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:03,415
We were certain to do the right thing,

27
00:02:03,416 --> 00:02:05,467
we breathed the same
air as everybody else.

28
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:06,259
We were part of this.

29
00:02:07,581 --> 00:02:09,326
And then he takes off my coat and says:

30
00:02:09,327 --> 00:02:12,097
The Russians have no idea
what's coming towards them.

31
00:02:13,181 --> 00:02:17,538
So we were heading towards the
Sorbonne and chatting away in French.

32
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:21,540
He thought that I was one
of those tall blond Swedes.

33
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:25,540
Then I made a double step
to match my stride to his.

34
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:29,620
That's when he stopped and said:
"Ah, a daughter of the Fuhrer"

35
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:33,970
That was the end of the acquaintance.
What a pity.

36
00:02:34,941 --> 00:02:38,900
Hold on. I... I'd like to...
Stop the music, please.

37
00:02:41,581 --> 00:02:46,132
I would like for us all
to share this moment,

38
00:02:46,261 --> 00:02:49,810
this wonderful evening,
with our husbands

39
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:53,860
who are stationed
somewhere all over Europe.

40
00:03:01,901 --> 00:03:03,937
(Explosions)

41
00:03:11,061 --> 00:03:12,892
Get lost!

42
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:14,773
Run, run!

43
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:16,250
Get away!

44
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:21,969
(woman) Go away!
(officer) Houses on the right. Fan out.

45
00:03:22,101 --> 00:03:24,057
(honking)

46
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:26,417
(Soldiers singing)

47
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:34,857
Come here, damn it!

48
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:37,815
(child)
Mummy, where are you?

49
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:41,134
Come on. Hurry.

50
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:07,421
(Soldier)
Away. Go away.

51
00:04:09,341 --> 00:04:12,413
Open fire, reload grenade.

52
00:04:13,381 --> 00:04:15,337
...and fire!

53
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:22,969
Fire!

54
00:04:24,221 --> 00:04:25,370
Shit.

55
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:31,570
- Wait for me.
- Watch out! Heads down.

56
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:35,494
- There you are.
- Stop! Wait for me.

57
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:36,610
Watch out!

58
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,850
(woman)
No!

59
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:51,140
No uniforms, no weapons,
or it's martial law.

60
00:04:51,901 --> 00:04:53,857
(Russian)

61
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,254
(woman)
Felix, where are you?

62
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:03,220
Felix?

63
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:08,292
- Where the hell is he? Felix?
- Not a single order.

64
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:12,420
No messages, nothing at all.
Nobody gives a shit about us.

65
00:05:12,901 --> 00:05:16,860
Felix? Lenchen, Lenchen?
Where are you, damn it?

66
00:05:17,821 --> 00:05:21,136
In Wedding district, they are already
showing their toddlers to the Russians.

67
00:05:21,236 --> 00:05:22,451
Russian pigs.

68
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:26,733
That were the book dealers.
They sometimes speak French.

69
00:05:29,181 --> 00:05:32,093
And that's the pharmacist's widow.

70
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:37,011
Her husband once cured Minister
Hindenburg's headache.

71
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:38,018
That's over.

72
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:41,817
Now you step on the face
and the arms of a dead woman

73
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:45,219
only to get a glass of jelly.

74
00:05:48,021 --> 00:05:53,049
That's the quiet Mrs. Binder.
Musician. Her husband is MIA.

75
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:56,537
(Screaming)

76
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:01,659
Can someone help?
She is suffocating.

77
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:06,740
Look at me. Look at me!

78
00:06:07,421 --> 00:06:10,970
I will write all of this down,
I will report it.

79
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:15,019
Gerd, and you shall read it.

80
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:18,174
May I offer you something?

81
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:21,220
Thank you.

82
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:32,699
From Silesia.
She won't make it.

83
00:06:54,661 --> 00:06:56,617
(Music)

84
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,537
Go, go, go!
Go down there, quick!

85
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:26,539
- Mummy?
- Don't be afraid, I am here.

86
00:07:31,061 --> 00:07:32,858
They're coming.

87
00:07:37,501 --> 00:07:39,457
(Russian)

88
00:07:51,021 --> 00:07:52,249
Halt!

89
00:08:22,581 --> 00:08:27,211
(Announcement) Attention, attention.
To all the residents of this street.

90
00:08:28,581 --> 00:08:32,130
All fire arms have to be
turned in immediately.

91
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:36,374
This is the last warning.

92
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:39,301
Attention, attention.

93
00:08:39,621 --> 00:08:42,454
This is the last warning.

94
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:07,457
(Russian)

95
00:09:35,082 --> 00:09:36,582
Attack!

96
00:09:50,078 --> 00:09:51,578
Upstairs!

97
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,968
All the way upstairs!

98
00:10:08,102 --> 00:10:09,602
Go away! Not now!

99
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:10,736
Attention!

100
00:10:26,261 --> 00:10:28,217
(Russian)

101
00:10:40,618 --> 00:10:42,118
I... I have...

102
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:47,919
(whispering in Russian)

103
00:11:01,882 --> 00:11:02,882
Careful!

104
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:05,331
Comrade Colonel.

105
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,623
The troops have almost
reached Potsdam station.

106
00:11:10,072 --> 00:11:13,072
But the order was to go towards
the government district!

107
00:11:16,048 --> 00:11:18,548
Understood,
Comrade Colonel.

108
00:11:22,957 --> 00:11:24,457
We'll stay here.

109
00:11:24,957 --> 00:11:26,457
Major! I thought we were
going to the Reichstag.

110
00:11:27,052 --> 00:11:28,552
No Reichstag? But why not,
we are so close.

111
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:31,626
Screw it,
we are not staying here!

112
00:11:31,886 --> 00:11:33,886
That's an order!

113
00:11:34,936 --> 00:11:37,936
Retreat!
Secure our flank!

114
00:11:40,459 --> 00:11:41,959
Understood?

115
00:11:45,966 --> 00:11:47,966
Soldiers?
Officers?

116
00:11:49,491 --> 00:11:50,991
Weapons?

117
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,510
I said: Soldiers?
Officers?

118
00:11:55,621 --> 00:11:59,057
(woman)
They will see soon enough.

119
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:03,139
Anybody got weapons?
Hand them over.

120
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:05,550
Get out!
One person at a time.

121
00:12:18,803 --> 00:12:19,803
Get out, all of you!
Move it!

122
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:23,009
- Russian filth!
- Up!

123
00:12:27,342 --> 00:12:29,842
What... do you want?

124
00:12:36,301 --> 00:12:37,336
Russian?

125
00:12:39,122 --> 00:12:40,122
Yes.

126
00:12:45,581 --> 00:12:46,855
Russian!

127
00:12:47,861 --> 00:12:49,135
Come.

128
00:12:49,581 --> 00:12:50,536
Come.

129
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:52,970
Eat.

130
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:58,137
War kaput.

131
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:00,016
Woman.

132
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:02,736
Come! Eat.

133
00:13:04,341 --> 00:13:06,297
War kaput, woman.

134
00:13:06,355 --> 00:13:07,355
Come on.

135
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:10,578
No fear.

136
00:13:10,701 --> 00:13:12,692
No fear.

137
00:13:21,861 --> 00:13:24,853
We will not die here.

138
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:47,697
Bravo, come, come.

139
00:13:48,501 --> 00:13:50,014
Don't be afraid.

140
00:13:51,221 --> 00:13:52,176
Come.

141
00:13:53,141 --> 00:13:54,859
Don't shiver!

142
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:57,094
Good! Come.

143
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:02,417
Hey, cuties!
Come over here.

144
00:14:04,621 --> 00:14:07,454
You be nice and you'll
get something to eat.

145
00:14:12,701 --> 00:14:14,817
Potatoes. Very good.

146
00:14:57,501 --> 00:14:59,457
May I?

147
00:15:13,341 --> 00:15:15,377
(soldiers laughing)

148
00:15:18,341 --> 00:15:20,377
(Music)

149
00:15:30,181 --> 00:15:32,649
Does anybody know
how this thing works?

150
00:15:33,021 --> 00:15:34,541
You, Ukrainian,
do you know it?

151
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:38,130
There they are,
our Russian liberators.

152
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:40,138
Full of joy.

153
00:15:40,261 --> 00:15:44,857
It seems they can hardly believe
that they've made it this far.

154
00:15:44,981 --> 00:15:47,453
I know them,
their sandals and villages.

155
00:15:47,454 --> 00:15:50,851
Their rapidly constructed new
buildings they are so proud of.

156
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:52,301
Stop!

157
00:15:52,461 --> 00:15:55,219
They are without any constraints.

158
00:15:55,261 --> 00:15:56,296
Don't move,
asshole!

159
00:15:56,741 --> 00:15:58,459
Leave her.

160
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,974
Get lost.

161
00:16:14,521 --> 00:16:16,781
Urine.
Why don't you use urine?

162
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:20,853
That's enough!

163
00:16:21,101 --> 00:16:22,050
No, seriously...

164
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:24,297
Your urine is much too old.

165
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:28,857
Back in Leningrad, I put my general
back on his feet with urine...

166
00:16:30,461 --> 00:16:32,053
You storyteller!

167
00:16:32,821 --> 00:16:34,049
It's true.

168
00:16:40,141 --> 00:16:41,859
What are they doing?

169
00:16:44,581 --> 00:16:45,536
Please!

170
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:47,376
Please!

171
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:51,011
Have you husband?

172
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:54,217
A husband and two children.

173
00:16:59,221 --> 00:17:01,974
Come anyway.

174
00:17:02,581 --> 00:17:07,211
Quick, quick!
(woman) Let me through! Let me through!

175
00:17:10,781 --> 00:17:13,614
No, no, you pigs.

176
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:16,460
You pigs! No!

177
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:21,620
- You don't belong here.
- I didn't do anything wrong.

178
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,680
Stop.

179
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:26,220
- You filthy pigs, leave me alone!
(man) Come on, don't be so prude.

180
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:30,220
Most fellow countrymen adeptly
saved their own hides.

181
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:33,856
The girl from Silesia was easy prey.

182
00:17:34,281 --> 00:17:35,296
Leave!

183
00:17:36,661 --> 00:17:38,617
Mrs. Hitler.

184
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:44,059
You slut! Where to?

185
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:45,699
To the Fuhrer?

186
00:17:48,861 --> 00:17:52,649
Here. Quick.
Penthouse to the right. Quick! Go!

187
00:17:55,341 --> 00:17:58,060
Take this and go! Go!

188
00:17:58,341 --> 00:17:59,376
Come.

189
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:07,533
You speak Russian.
You can't abandon me like that.

190
00:18:14,581 --> 00:18:15,616
Soldier!

191
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,497
Why are you taking a woman...

192
00:18:25,381 --> 00:18:27,451
who doesn't want you?

193
00:18:28,621 --> 00:18:30,452
Willing women are unclean.

194
00:18:41,741 --> 00:18:43,732
(Door is closed)

195
00:18:50,861 --> 00:18:53,500
Open the door! Open it!

196
00:18:53,621 --> 00:18:56,579
Open the door,
you bastards! Open it!

197
00:19:22,501 --> 00:19:24,457
(Music)

198
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:37,332
Not here.

199
00:20:00,261 --> 00:20:03,219
- Where?
- Almost there.

200
00:20:09,821 --> 00:20:12,733
Stop! Stay where you are!

201
00:20:16,741 --> 00:20:18,015
Hey you.

202
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:19,494
Shoo shoo!

203
00:20:24,901 --> 00:20:26,334
Commander...

204
00:20:26,861 --> 00:20:28,340
I am looking for
the commanding officer.

205
00:20:28,501 --> 00:20:30,093
What's up?

206
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:33,099
Are you in charge here?

207
00:20:33,461 --> 00:20:36,214
I... we need help.

208
00:20:42,541 --> 00:20:44,532
Are you in charge here?

209
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:48,933
There are many in charge here.
Everybody is in charge.

210
00:20:50,421 --> 00:20:51,536
Which one do you want?

211
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:56,300
Major, sir...

212
00:20:57,901 --> 00:21:00,461
We need your help...

213
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,453
Our men are all healthy and clean.

214
00:21:07,981 --> 00:21:10,017
(car departs)

215
00:21:29,781 --> 00:21:31,737
Mrs. Hitler.

216
00:21:32,501 --> 00:21:35,334
Our country is finished.

217
00:21:36,341 --> 00:21:39,936
Gerd, do you remember your first words?

218
00:21:40,061 --> 00:21:45,340
"Give me 30 minutes and you will
never want to leave me again."

219
00:21:47,181 --> 00:21:49,172
God almighty.

220
00:22:49,021 --> 00:22:52,900
- That is the back corridor.
- The widow offered me a place to stay.

221
00:22:53,021 --> 00:22:58,095
She took me by the hand and just led me
inside her undestroyed apartment.

222
00:23:00,101 --> 00:23:06,813
- I gratefully accepted the offer.
- You can stay here for a while.

223
00:23:07,181 --> 00:23:13,017
Moving places was easy: a blouse,
a few books and notebooks.

224
00:23:13,461 --> 00:23:17,340
- You are welcome to stay.
- Thank you, I'll take your offer.

225
00:23:19,021 --> 00:23:21,057
(Russians singing)

226
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:32,334
Take good care of yourself.

227
00:23:37,141 --> 00:23:41,100
In spite of everything, it would have
been good to have a closer look around.

228
00:23:41,661 --> 00:23:46,815
But then, we never know everything,
so that's how the story continued.

229
00:24:01,661 --> 00:24:04,494
I guess it has been
really nice here once.

230
00:24:06,501 --> 00:24:09,891
How did you find me here?

231
00:24:11,341 --> 00:24:14,299
I searched every cellar.

232
00:24:29,941 --> 00:24:31,897
How often?

233
00:24:38,341 --> 00:24:39,410
Often.

234
00:24:45,261 --> 00:24:46,614
The shores are clad in green,

235
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:49,129
the trees are breathing
freely and deeply

236
00:24:49,261 --> 00:24:51,411
We bravely stride on and on,

237
00:24:51,741 --> 00:24:53,771
towards the final assault
in this war!

238
00:24:55,581 --> 00:24:57,492
Our path was long to reach
this day in May.

239
00:24:57,621 --> 00:25:00,010
It has cost us much
strength and courage.

240
00:25:00,181 --> 00:25:02,456
But now we are free again!

241
00:25:02,621 --> 00:25:05,499
We proudly take our positions.

242
00:25:06,621 --> 00:25:07,736
Greetings, May.

243
00:25:09,581 --> 00:25:14,176
Our soldiers and a few American weapons,
and those would be history.

244
00:25:14,177 --> 00:25:14,530
Yeah.

245
00:25:18,861 --> 00:25:20,817
(Russians cheering)

246
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:29,853
Yesterday at the water pump,
it was my turn,

247
00:25:29,854 --> 00:25:31,099
a guy approaches me,

248
00:25:32,301 --> 00:25:36,897
two Iron Crosses and one German
Cross in Gold on his chest,

249
00:25:37,021 --> 00:25:40,980
and he gallantly takes the buckets
out of my hands. And I say:

250
00:25:41,101 --> 00:25:47,097
"How do I deserve this honor?"
and he says "We can't give up now"

251
00:25:47,701 --> 00:25:51,296
"because if the Russian
even remotely does to us

252
00:25:51,421 --> 00:25:55,300
"what we did to them
during the last four years,

253
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:59,570
"in the near future there won't
be any living Germans left."

254
00:26:02,781 --> 00:26:05,739
"In the near future"?
Nobody talks like that.

255
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:18,053
Hey you Slavs!
We're in Berlin! We made it!

256
00:26:30,621 --> 00:26:35,297
How do you say: Excuse me,
do you have a dictionary?

257
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:40,334
I guess he doesn't need a
dictionary for what he wants.

258
00:26:49,781 --> 00:26:51,737
(banging)

259
00:26:54,941 --> 00:26:55,930
Lenchen!

260
00:26:56,061 --> 00:26:58,097
(unintelligible)

261
00:27:07,301 --> 00:27:09,257
Come with us!

262
00:27:09,581 --> 00:27:11,811
Come where?

263
00:27:13,061 --> 00:27:14,050
Lenchen!

264
00:27:14,181 --> 00:27:17,969
During the next few days,
our house was raided day and night.

265
00:27:18,101 --> 00:27:19,853
Lenchen!

266
00:27:20,341 --> 00:27:24,539
One woman hanged herself,
another one was shot to death.

267
00:27:24,661 --> 00:27:26,811
None of us was spared.

268
00:27:26,941 --> 00:27:29,899
Every emotion is dead.

269
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:31,370
Hey, you from Berlin!

270
00:27:31,461 --> 00:27:33,770
Over here! Upstairs.
What kept you so long?

271
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:36,898
Berlin is ours.
Germany is ours.

272
00:27:37,261 --> 00:27:38,694
Forever!

273
00:27:39,181 --> 00:27:40,694
Lenchen.

274
00:27:43,021 --> 00:27:45,979
- What have you got there?
- A map.

275
00:27:53,621 --> 00:27:55,139
Move it! Faster.

276
00:27:55,301 --> 00:27:56,939
You go left,
I go right.

277
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:07,890
Where are you going?
Come to us.

278
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:14,294
Come.

279
00:28:16,181 --> 00:28:20,572
Wake up, damned of the earth,
who are living in hunger and misery.

280
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:24,853
Justice is about to burst through
like glowing magma in a volcano.

281
00:28:42,301 --> 00:28:45,293
You just go away, away!

282
00:28:55,301 --> 00:28:56,700
I!

283
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:12,221
I...

284
00:29:12,321 --> 00:29:13,973
...love...

285
00:29:14,541 --> 00:29:16,497
...you.

286
00:29:48,181 --> 00:29:50,172
Good day.

287
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:05,137
Please, don't!

288
00:30:13,901 --> 00:30:17,211
My pretty one.
I'll be back.

289
00:30:20,341 --> 00:30:22,536
My pretty one...

290
00:31:08,941 --> 00:31:11,216
I am a young man...

291
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:18,296
You scared me.

292
00:31:39,741 --> 00:31:41,732
(Music)

293
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:54,734
We will survive all this,

294
00:31:57,901 --> 00:32:00,131
by any means necessary.

295
00:32:42,701 --> 00:32:44,259
Where to?

296
00:32:45,101 --> 00:32:46,534
We're here.

297
00:32:53,901 --> 00:32:55,095
Who are you looking for?

298
00:32:58,021 --> 00:33:00,854
- Kommandatura?
- Kommandatura.

299
00:33:04,021 --> 00:33:08,572
So where are they now,
our saviors, all the great armies?

300
00:33:09,061 --> 00:33:12,935
In the past, war and dying
was a male exclusive thing.

301
00:33:12,936 --> 00:33:14,977
But those times are long gone.

302
00:33:15,781 --> 00:33:19,569
Damned Russians. Officer, General,
Commander, doesn't matter.

303
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:22,659
I take everyone,
as high in rank as possible.

304
00:33:22,861 --> 00:33:25,819
From now on,
I will decide who gets me.

305
00:33:27,861 --> 00:33:32,491
No, no. Get out of there, will you?
This is still my bed.

306
00:33:33,061 --> 00:33:37,020
You can protect us from over there
on the couch, see? Protect.

307
00:33:37,461 --> 00:33:41,010
Hm? See.
You don't have to get under my blanket.

308
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:45,254
Do you understand?

309
00:33:46,221 --> 00:33:48,212
(Russian)

310
00:34:22,381 --> 00:34:23,450
Where is the Major?

311
00:34:23,501 --> 00:34:25,139
Wait.

312
00:34:30,061 --> 00:34:31,096
Hey, Miss.

313
00:34:31,221 --> 00:34:32,779
Who are you looking for?

314
00:34:35,021 --> 00:34:36,141
You, blondie.

315
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:38,450
Why are you looking so stern?

316
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:47,529
You!

317
00:34:47,621 --> 00:34:50,693
Could you soap my back, huh?

318
00:35:19,701 --> 00:35:22,534
Who do you want to talk to?

319
00:35:24,301 --> 00:35:26,292
You.

320
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:33,129
Dismissed.

321
00:35:48,381 --> 00:35:51,214
May I have a seat?

322
00:35:51,901 --> 00:35:52,970
No.

323
00:36:07,461 --> 00:36:13,616
Yesterday our house has been occupied
and many women have been raped.

324
00:36:17,741 --> 00:36:21,017
I know nothing of that.

325
00:36:23,901 --> 00:36:26,859
It is your duty to help us.

326
00:36:36,301 --> 00:36:37,290
Who?

327
00:36:38,701 --> 00:36:39,816
My people...

328
00:36:39,941 --> 00:36:41,613
...or yours?

329
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:46,570
Me.

330
00:36:57,661 --> 00:37:01,256
That's just a few minutes.
That's nothing to worry about.

331
00:37:09,141 --> 00:37:11,132
(Unintelligible)

332
00:37:12,821 --> 00:37:15,381
It's pointless.

333
00:37:17,981 --> 00:37:21,610
You Russian? Looking what?

334
00:37:22,781 --> 00:37:25,534
Who are you looking for?
Commanding officer?

335
00:37:28,421 --> 00:37:31,219
They are all with their women.
But I can do it too.

336
00:37:31,901 --> 00:37:33,254
Lieutenant, sir.

337
00:37:33,341 --> 00:37:34,740
May I have a word?

338
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:40,099
Some of the balconies in
our house are mined.

339
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:43,209
Could you help?

340
00:37:53,421 --> 00:37:54,570
Pity.

341
00:37:58,381 --> 00:37:59,973
Miss!

342
00:38:05,341 --> 00:38:07,491
You, I, evening?

343
00:38:08,741 --> 00:38:09,730
Hm?

344
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,617
I Anatol.

345
00:38:18,301 --> 00:38:21,532
You, I, simple as that, huh?

346
00:38:23,421 --> 00:38:26,811
At this moment I made a vow,

347
00:38:26,941 --> 00:38:31,492
that nothing and nobody would
touch me, no matter what happened.

348
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:35,773
Come in.
Follow.

349
00:38:36,221 --> 00:38:38,451
That's where I live.

350
00:38:38,541 --> 00:38:40,611
Come on in.

351
00:38:42,581 --> 00:38:46,540
You need to go now, understand?
Go back to your buddies.

352
00:38:51,501 --> 00:38:52,650
Well...

353
00:38:53,941 --> 00:38:56,501
That's my husband.

354
00:38:57,941 --> 00:39:00,774
Don't you understand?

355
00:39:01,861 --> 00:39:04,136
My husband.

356
00:39:05,221 --> 00:39:07,781
You must understand that.

357
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:11,291
All humans are bad.

358
00:39:14,741 --> 00:39:19,132
I never get what he's saying.
He just won't leave.

359
00:39:26,261 --> 00:39:29,219
What are doing?
That is mahogany.

360
00:39:29,581 --> 00:39:32,300
Relax.
Go into the kitchen.

361
00:39:33,301 --> 00:39:37,260
To the 215th Rifles!

362
00:39:40,101 --> 00:39:41,141
To victory!

363
00:39:41,141 --> 00:39:42,540
To us.

364
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:47,657
I Charkov!

365
00:39:47,981 --> 00:39:49,061
He's from Charkov.

366
00:39:49,221 --> 00:39:52,980
Charkov! Ah!
I'm industrial accountant in books.

367
00:39:53,301 --> 00:39:55,132
An accountant?
You're kidding me.

368
00:39:55,301 --> 00:39:59,214
I accountant! You accountant!
We accountant!

369
00:40:03,541 --> 00:40:04,530
Everything fine.

370
00:40:04,581 --> 00:40:07,015
That's life, you see?

371
00:40:07,221 --> 00:40:08,370
You, pretty.

372
00:40:09,061 --> 00:40:13,020
Ain't they great guys, those Russians?
They are full of juice and strength.

373
00:40:13,381 --> 00:40:16,976
The fucking war is really
pissing me off.

374
00:40:17,621 --> 00:40:18,690
True.

375
00:40:19,061 --> 00:40:20,972
When I get back to Charkov,

376
00:40:21,061 --> 00:40:23,211
I'll marry, build a house,

377
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:24,973
get children.
I am working in the kolkhoz.

378
00:40:25,061 --> 00:40:27,370
and you, I will
take you as my accountant.

379
00:40:28,221 --> 00:40:30,371
Are you a professional soldier?

380
00:40:30,981 --> 00:40:32,381
No...

381
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:34,531
I, dairy.

382
00:40:35,301 --> 00:40:37,861
Milk! Milk. Cow.

383
00:40:40,261 --> 00:40:45,972
- How very interesting.
- Interesting! Milk and milk.

384
00:40:48,301 --> 00:40:49,859
That's bullshit.

385
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:51,580
Look at this.

386
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:53,980
My trophies.

387
00:40:54,981 --> 00:40:56,539
That's nothing.

388
00:40:56,581 --> 00:40:57,775
Here.

389
00:40:58,461 --> 00:41:00,770
THAT is a trophy.

390
00:41:01,141 --> 00:41:02,540
That's not a trophy.

391
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:04,732
Have a look at this.

392
00:41:04,881 --> 00:41:06,219
That...

393
00:41:07,461 --> 00:41:09,452
...that is a REAL trophy.

394
00:41:10,381 --> 00:41:11,860
An original.

395
00:41:12,541 --> 00:41:14,213
My present to all the ladies.

396
00:41:14,541 --> 00:41:16,138
To kiss and marvel about.

397
00:41:17,981 --> 00:41:19,301
Where toilet?

398
00:41:19,361 --> 00:41:21,695
- The toilet's on the corridor.
- Thanks.

399
00:41:48,741 --> 00:41:51,574
Would you like something to eat?

400
00:41:55,021 --> 00:41:56,215
You.

401
00:42:18,701 --> 00:42:20,692
(Baby screaming)

402
00:42:30,701 --> 00:42:32,214
You fancy my dick?

403
00:42:32,381 --> 00:42:34,133
Doesn't matter which one.

404
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:35,700
Dick is dick.

405
00:42:41,101 --> 00:42:43,217
Why Russia?

406
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,097
What were you doing there,
you sons of a bitch?

407
00:42:49,741 --> 00:42:51,697
Why Russia?

408
00:43:01,141 --> 00:43:05,100
That is Major...
afraid I forgot his name already.

409
00:43:14,101 --> 00:43:18,538
He is battalion commander. They don't
have commandants, only commanders.

410
00:43:18,821 --> 00:43:23,975
(widow) Did you know that they study
German as first foreign language?

411
00:43:24,621 --> 00:43:29,012
Well, it needs a war for us to
get this bit of information.

412
00:43:29,141 --> 00:43:31,974
Can I do something for you?

413
00:43:32,141 --> 00:43:34,097
(door slamming)

414
00:43:38,261 --> 00:43:41,571
Hey Mongol. Have you come
all the way from Moscow

415
00:43:41,701 --> 00:43:44,693
just to get some water
for a German woman?

416
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:47,932
Or is our major bathing in rose essence?

417
00:43:58,541 --> 00:44:00,497
Made in Germany...

418
00:44:01,461 --> 00:44:03,338
I am taking care of the Major.

419
00:44:06,941 --> 00:44:08,981
Go now.
I'll catch up later.

420
00:44:09,281 --> 00:44:10,812
Go.

421
00:44:10,901 --> 00:44:13,734
Go, Mongol, go!

422
00:44:14,061 --> 00:44:17,974
Move it. Faster!
Go, go, go!

423
00:44:18,181 --> 00:44:20,058
Move it already.
Faster.

424
00:44:26,061 --> 00:44:31,499
A bomb hit the garden of the neighbors
and the whole house was rubble.

425
00:44:31,901 --> 00:44:37,055
And it blasted the fattened
sow up till under the roof.

426
00:44:38,541 --> 00:44:41,499
Well, obviously it was spoiled.

427
00:44:48,621 --> 00:44:50,134
Here.

428
00:44:53,461 --> 00:44:54,780
Give it to me.

429
00:45:04,141 --> 00:45:05,540
My apologies...

430
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,174
for my unsuitable behavior.

431
00:45:07,301 --> 00:45:08,734
Dismissed.

432
00:45:12,261 --> 00:45:14,252
(Music)

433
00:45:33,461 --> 00:45:34,655
Berlin is ours.

434
00:45:35,021 --> 00:45:36,579
There.

435
00:45:48,101 --> 00:45:51,650
I have told everybody
that they needed to go.

436
00:45:55,221 --> 00:45:58,054
May I sit down?

437
00:46:05,661 --> 00:46:08,221
Come here.

438
00:46:09,381 --> 00:46:11,372
As you wish.

439
00:46:45,261 --> 00:46:46,330
No?

440
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:15,771
The raping process continues.
They are everywhere.

441
00:47:16,861 --> 00:47:19,170
In every apartment.

442
00:47:19,301 --> 00:47:22,498
We are Russian property now.
At their service.

443
00:47:22,781 --> 00:47:26,535
But us women, we will need to
keep our mouths shut,

444
00:47:26,661 --> 00:47:30,864
or no man will ever want to touch
us again when this is all over.

445
00:47:30,865 --> 00:47:31,052
Poor Germany.

446
00:47:40,021 --> 00:47:42,933
German fighters: sit!

447
00:48:19,461 --> 00:48:23,374
Four. Four women.

448
00:48:24,781 --> 00:48:27,136
The whole of Berlin is a brothel.

449
00:48:31,941 --> 00:48:33,579
Here.
That's what I've found.

450
00:48:33,901 --> 00:48:35,539
They've got everything.

451
00:48:35,821 --> 00:48:37,573
They've got jewelry
and money and houses.

452
00:48:37,981 --> 00:48:40,176
And yet they go to war!
Scoundrels.

453
00:48:40,901 --> 00:48:42,619
Enough.

454
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:49,454
What do I care about them?

455
00:48:50,701 --> 00:48:55,297
Sometimes I think that from now on
I could endure everything imaginable,

456
00:48:55,421 --> 00:48:57,858
as long as it comes from the outside

457
00:48:57,859 --> 00:49:00,973
and not from deep within
my treacherous heart.

458
00:49:03,181 --> 00:49:08,733
I am swell.
And my Russian is improving.

459
00:49:19,061 --> 00:49:21,894
- Is there anyone?
- Nobody.

460
00:49:41,861 --> 00:49:43,214
A welcome committee.

461
00:49:44,701 --> 00:49:47,454
Madam, I brought you a cavalier.

462
00:49:51,661 --> 00:49:54,494
Anatol is a gypsy.

463
00:49:55,141 --> 00:49:59,100
Comes and goes as he pleases.
No protection.

464
00:49:59,701 --> 00:50:01,851
My sun.

465
00:50:14,821 --> 00:50:16,891
Do you think...

466
00:50:17,221 --> 00:50:20,770
Do you think the Fuhrer has forsaken us?

467
00:50:20,981 --> 00:50:23,211
No. Never.

468
00:50:30,701 --> 00:50:31,816
Here.

469
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:36,341
Is that all?

470
00:50:42,261 --> 00:50:45,094
My head is aching like crazy.

471
00:50:59,221 --> 00:51:03,134
- Where are you going?
- I'll get you some food.

472
00:51:03,261 --> 00:51:06,298
If that's the last thing
I'll do in my life.

473
00:51:14,541 --> 00:51:16,532
What about the Reichstag?
I don't give a shit about it.

474
00:51:16,621 --> 00:51:19,055
Fuck the Reichstag.

475
00:51:21,461 --> 00:51:24,851
Then he grabs me
and throws me on the bed.

476
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:31,376
And suddenly, he gets so boring,
like a lapdog.

477
00:51:33,661 --> 00:51:37,495
Later, he complimented me.

478
00:51:37,621 --> 00:51:41,534
He said:
"Ukrainian women like this."

479
00:51:42,941 --> 00:51:45,501
"You, like this."

480
00:51:51,261 --> 00:51:54,936
He had really bad breath.

481
00:51:55,341 --> 00:51:57,377
(banging)

482
00:52:06,501 --> 00:52:11,291
- Oh. It's you.
- Good morning. We bring breakfast.

483
00:52:12,181 --> 00:52:15,935
The next morning, a few blocks
away the war was still raging,

484
00:52:16,061 --> 00:52:20,020
- the Major came with all his troops.
- Good morning.

485
00:52:21,021 --> 00:52:26,300
The widow, who loved bacon,
was busy as a bee.

486
00:52:27,981 --> 00:52:32,213
Mr. Eckart, our man of the home guard,
was all too happy to surrender.

487
00:52:33,173 --> 00:52:34,173
This way.

488
00:52:35,981 --> 00:52:39,018
- Russian horse.
- What's that?

489
00:52:41,541 --> 00:52:43,190
Sugar. We have sugar!

490
00:52:43,191 --> 00:52:46,410
And bacon and salami
and bread and butter.

491
00:52:46,541 --> 00:52:49,658
Great joy,
but not for everybody.

492
00:52:53,541 --> 00:52:55,179
Then came the cavalry.

493
00:52:55,261 --> 00:52:57,900
Fluttering coats, sabres ahead,
horses snuffling.

494
00:52:57,981 --> 00:52:59,130
When a horse is charging,

495
00:52:59,261 --> 00:53:01,900
that's an incredible force.

496
00:53:02,061 --> 00:53:05,098
The whole avalanche is
charging against the tank,

497
00:53:05,301 --> 00:53:08,418
against the artillery,
against all the machine guns -

498
00:53:08,581 --> 00:53:10,731
All kaput.

499
00:53:12,301 --> 00:53:13,529
You've had much more troops,

500
00:53:13,661 --> 00:53:15,379
but they just couldn't stand it.

501
00:53:15,501 --> 00:53:17,696
They dropped their weapons and fled.

502
00:53:17,797 --> 00:53:19,697
German soldiers, bah!

503
00:53:21,541 --> 00:53:22,974
Don't be so insensitive.

504
00:53:23,061 --> 00:53:24,050
We didn't start this war!

505
00:53:24,181 --> 00:53:25,541
Sit down.

506
00:53:25,641 --> 00:53:27,213
And stop insulting our host.

507
00:53:27,341 --> 00:53:28,820
Enough.

508
00:53:29,101 --> 00:53:31,057
I Caucasus.

509
00:53:31,301 --> 00:53:32,859
Caucasus, understand?

510
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:35,617
Big mountain, so beautiful!

511
00:53:36,301 --> 00:53:38,940
Sun, blue sky.

512
00:53:39,821 --> 00:53:42,540
Nice dancing with women.

513
00:53:43,301 --> 00:53:46,691
As sweet as grapes.

514
00:53:47,541 --> 00:53:50,055
And Pushkin.
He had to live there in exile.

515
00:53:50,901 --> 00:53:53,574
Pushkin? Doesn't matter.
I want to go home.

516
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:56,017
Go home, understand?

517
00:53:56,781 --> 00:53:58,931
I want to see my children
and my wife.

518
00:53:59,181 --> 00:54:01,137
(Singing)

519
00:54:14,421 --> 00:54:16,139
See?
And all you can think of is "Pushkin."

520
00:54:18,461 --> 00:54:20,770
I want my wife.

521
00:54:20,781 --> 00:54:23,739
My wife. Understand?

522
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:31,014
What do you know about fascism?

523
00:54:31,861 --> 00:54:33,419
Fascism?

524
00:54:39,941 --> 00:54:44,492
From ancient Rome, Latin "fascio", means a
"bundle of sticks", figuratively a league.

525
00:54:47,661 --> 00:54:48,730
To our host.

526
00:54:48,821 --> 00:54:49,741
Right.

527
00:54:49,841 --> 00:54:52,050
To a woman who is
quite obviously very bright.

528
00:54:52,381 --> 00:54:54,815
Just like you right now.
Very bright.

529
00:54:55,701 --> 00:54:57,180
But I am not a woman!

530
00:54:57,421 --> 00:55:00,379
To German-Russian friendship!

531
00:55:02,261 --> 00:55:03,979
Hurray!

532
00:55:07,221 --> 00:55:08,859
Everybody upstairs, quick!

533
00:55:09,141 --> 00:55:11,655
Hurry! Quick!

534
00:55:15,861 --> 00:55:18,136
Search all the apartments.

535
00:55:30,541 --> 00:55:32,611
Out. Out!

536
00:55:35,981 --> 00:55:40,736
You goddamn bastard!
You dick! You fucking dick!

537
00:55:43,101 --> 00:55:44,580
Stop it.

538
00:55:45,421 --> 00:55:46,695
Enough!

539
00:55:49,181 --> 00:55:50,170
You know Stalin's orders.

540
00:55:51,061 --> 00:55:52,460
Get lost.

541
00:55:52,741 --> 00:55:54,299
Really? What if I don't?

542
00:55:54,481 --> 00:55:56,417
Are you gonna shoot me?

543
00:55:59,421 --> 00:56:02,060
I'll kill you if I have to.

544
00:56:05,701 --> 00:56:07,976
He is acting on my orders.

545
00:56:08,901 --> 00:56:10,050
Stop!

546
00:56:10,141 --> 00:56:12,860
A young soldier has stolen food.

547
00:56:14,261 --> 00:56:15,614
He is armed.

548
00:56:18,381 --> 00:56:19,814
Who is living up there?

549
00:56:23,101 --> 00:56:24,898
Who is living there?

550
00:56:29,061 --> 00:56:30,972
Anybody living there?

551
00:56:32,461 --> 00:56:33,610
No.

552
00:56:34,701 --> 00:56:36,054
She's lying.

553
00:56:36,421 --> 00:56:37,979
Lying bitch.

554
00:56:38,501 --> 00:56:40,253
I spit on Germany.

555
00:56:40,861 --> 00:56:42,977
And on Berlin.

556
00:56:43,301 --> 00:56:46,373
We conquered it,
and I spit on it!

557
00:56:47,781 --> 00:56:49,772
Get out of my way.

558
00:57:13,581 --> 00:57:14,900
Don't move.

559
00:57:20,421 --> 00:57:22,412
(screaming)

560
00:57:24,781 --> 00:57:27,853
I'll kill you, punk!

561
00:57:39,421 --> 00:57:45,815
Everyone in possession of fire
arms or hiding someone with guns

562
00:57:46,381 --> 00:57:50,056
will be executed immediately,
their houses destroyed.

563
00:57:57,701 --> 00:57:59,737
(footsteps)

564
00:58:09,581 --> 00:58:12,539
They will not forget this.

565
00:58:25,701 --> 00:58:28,659
Can I have something to drink?

566
00:58:46,221 --> 00:58:48,177
(Russian)

567
00:59:15,181 --> 00:59:17,217
(door opening)

568
00:59:27,381 --> 00:59:29,690
You need to get away from here.

569
00:59:45,061 --> 00:59:50,135
- What are you doing here?
- I won't go to Siberia.

570
01:00:09,501 --> 01:00:11,457
(Mongol singing)

571
01:01:24,461 --> 01:01:27,820
During the next few days,
the Major was here often.

572
01:01:27,821 --> 01:01:29,694
Great protection for everyone.

573
01:01:33,501 --> 01:01:38,131
In his coat he had tucked away candles
and cigars and plenty of gifts

574
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:42,573
that the widow stashed away in her
kitchen cupboard as quickly as possible.

575
01:01:42,701 --> 01:01:45,659
On the whole,
the times were changing.

576
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:47,937
(Russian)

577
01:01:53,061 --> 01:01:58,010
Russians love to play Santa Claus.
We don't want to spoil it for them, do we?

578
01:01:58,501 --> 01:02:01,413
That is way too much.

579
01:02:05,261 --> 01:02:09,857
The major speaks sophisticated Russian
and told me more than I wanted to know.

580
01:02:10,381 --> 01:02:12,308
Now I know about his bank account,

581
01:02:12,509 --> 01:02:15,136
his parents and the
names of his brothers.

582
01:02:15,261 --> 01:02:20,016
Today you are our guest.
Please, take a seat.

583
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:25,652
Such an old school cavalier.
I really like to touch him.

584
01:02:27,421 --> 01:02:29,412
(Russian)

585
01:02:30,941 --> 01:02:33,774
The war continued.

586
01:02:33,901 --> 01:02:37,280
While our men and husbands
were sent to Siberia,

587
01:02:37,501 --> 01:02:40,035
many of the women found protectors

588
01:02:40,136 --> 01:02:42,133
which made them a taboo
for the rest of the pack.

589
01:02:42,941 --> 01:02:46,171
Please hold it up.
That's a Singer.

590
01:02:46,172 --> 01:02:48,573
Almost there.
Hold it up. Up.

591
01:02:53,301 --> 01:02:54,746
In and out, in and out.

592
01:02:54,747 --> 01:02:57,260
It's like Grand Central Station in here.

593
01:02:59,541 --> 01:03:01,771
Mussolini is dead. Hanged.

594
01:03:01,861 --> 01:03:04,295
He deserved it.
One asshole less.

595
01:03:05,701 --> 01:03:07,054
Cheers!

596
01:03:20,941 --> 01:03:25,890
As soon as Andrej had left the house,
Anatol claimed his visiting rights.

597
01:03:26,021 --> 01:03:31,857
I was afraid that the two top dogs
would meet and kill me one day.

598
01:03:37,421 --> 01:03:42,415
It's not that I could claim
that this Major is raping me.

599
01:03:42,541 --> 01:03:45,374
I am at his service.

600
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:48,260
A whore? Maybe.

601
01:03:48,381 --> 01:03:50,258
(snoring)

602
01:03:50,381 --> 01:03:54,090
I have met that kind of
woman only once in my life.

603
01:03:54,221 --> 01:03:58,100
People told me not to talk to
her because she was unsound.

604
01:03:58,221 --> 01:04:01,258
Whatever that means: unsound.

605
01:04:02,781 --> 01:04:04,737
Young woman!

606
01:04:11,941 --> 01:04:13,932
No way.

607
01:04:15,981 --> 01:04:17,937
Incredible.

608
01:04:18,701 --> 01:04:22,250
There she comes prancing
along as if nothing happened.

609
01:04:27,381 --> 01:04:30,293
- How often?
- Four times. You?

610
01:04:34,101 --> 01:04:36,057
Come on.

611
01:04:38,021 --> 01:04:41,151
I can't believe I see you again.
You look well.

612
01:04:41,252 --> 01:04:42,194
So do you.

613
01:04:42,381 --> 01:04:44,990
Here. Quince jelly.
Real Bordeaux. Take it.

614
01:04:44,991 --> 01:04:46,294
You take that with you.

615
01:04:46,501 --> 01:04:49,146
Seems you are having
a good life here.

616
01:04:49,147 --> 01:04:51,655
That's one way to put it.
Come on.

617
01:04:52,861 --> 01:04:55,739
- I'm glad you're here.
- Me too.

618
01:04:55,861 --> 01:04:58,350
Elke's visit had cheered us all up.

619
01:04:58,351 --> 01:05:00,412
The Major is guarding us well

620
01:05:00,541 --> 01:05:02,831
so that we can drink his tea
without any disturbances.

621
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:04,031
That feels so good.

622
01:05:04,101 --> 01:05:05,614
Where to?

623
01:05:06,381 --> 01:05:07,780
What do you care?

624
01:05:08,021 --> 01:05:09,215
You can't go in there.

625
01:05:09,461 --> 01:05:11,019
Who's in there?

626
01:05:15,901 --> 01:05:18,379
What a nice and yummy bloke that was.

627
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,053
So I tell him:"Young man,

628
01:05:20,181 --> 01:05:24,652
"that gun there over your shoulder,
that might go off."

629
01:05:25,701 --> 01:05:28,534
And when I go up the stairs,

630
01:05:28,741 --> 01:05:32,450
on the second floor someone
rushes out of the apartment,

631
01:05:32,581 --> 01:05:35,373
grabs my hair and asks:
"You syphilis?"

632
01:05:35,374 --> 01:05:37,257
And I am in shock and I say:

633
01:05:37,381 --> 01:05:40,839
- "No, surely not."
- How dumb of you.

634
01:05:46,241 --> 01:05:47,547
How's your husband?

635
01:05:47,648 --> 01:05:49,229
He was there when it
happened the first time.

636
01:05:49,230 --> 01:05:50,500
He's been a bit confused ever since.

637
01:05:50,621 --> 01:05:54,455
- What do you say about our cavaliers?
- Pitiful.

638
01:05:54,781 --> 01:05:56,861
They are pretty unimaginative.

639
01:05:56,862 --> 01:05:58,456
It may be that at home,

640
01:05:58,581 --> 01:06:02,369
they have the latest and greatest
socialist planned economy,

641
01:06:02,501 --> 01:06:05,500
...but their sex life
is that of Adam and Eve.

642
01:06:05,501 --> 01:06:07,734
That's what I told my husband, too.

643
01:06:08,581 --> 01:06:13,735
With all the food shortage,
a good husband isn't worth that much.

644
01:06:14,221 --> 01:06:18,737
I guess a satisfactory sex
life depends on regular meals.

645
01:06:19,261 --> 01:06:22,208
For me, it's all
about a full stomach.

646
01:06:22,209 --> 01:06:23,720
No gifts, no sex!

647
01:06:27,941 --> 01:06:30,265
Heart, Pain, Love,
Sex Drive. To us!

648
01:06:30,266 --> 01:06:32,651
Who knows when we'll be
together again.

649
01:06:33,461 --> 01:06:36,294
All right, careful.
Hot, hot!

650
01:06:37,261 --> 01:06:39,241
That is apple streusel cake.

651
01:06:39,242 --> 01:06:42,210
Yeah, with crumbles,
and it's still steaming hot.

652
01:06:44,541 --> 01:06:47,453
(Singing)
# You, you are in my heart. #

653
01:06:47,701 --> 01:06:50,977
# You, you are on my mind. #

654
01:06:51,541 --> 01:06:54,482
# You, you cause me great pains, #

655
01:06:54,483 --> 01:06:57,855
# you don't know how much I love you. #

656
01:06:58,101 --> 01:06:59,630
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

657
01:06:59,631 --> 01:07:04,495
# don't know how much I love you. #

658
01:07:08,541 --> 01:07:12,295
Not too much going on with our
Russian men right now, am I right?

659
01:07:12,421 --> 01:07:17,449
- They are so puny and powerless.
- The weak sex.

660
01:07:19,181 --> 01:07:22,139
Have you heard anything from Gerd?

661
01:07:23,421 --> 01:07:26,370
I've got a question concerning Syphilis.

662
01:07:26,371 --> 01:07:27,255
Oh my God.

663
01:07:28,261 --> 01:07:30,565
How do you know you've got it?

664
01:07:30,566 --> 01:07:33,176
(Book seller) Itching and burning.

665
01:07:33,301 --> 01:07:37,135
- And enlarged lymph nodes.
- But that comes later.

666
01:07:38,581 --> 01:07:41,414
I've read it in a lexicon.

667
01:07:48,621 --> 01:07:50,691
A lexicon...

668
01:07:53,181 --> 01:07:53,981
Here.

669
01:07:54,181 --> 01:07:56,017
An American gave that to me.

670
01:07:58,221 --> 01:07:59,859
Chew it.

671
01:08:02,101 --> 01:08:03,773
Good, isn't it?

672
01:08:05,101 --> 01:08:06,978
Americans...

673
01:08:09,021 --> 01:08:11,694
They all look like film stars.

674
01:08:22,461 --> 01:08:24,895
I'm leaving.

675
01:08:26,141 --> 01:08:27,460
And tell her...

676
01:08:28,501 --> 01:08:30,412
that I'll be back.

677
01:08:32,221 --> 01:08:34,212
You got that?

678
01:08:42,541 --> 01:08:43,974
What's that?

679
01:08:58,661 --> 01:09:01,494
Can you protect us?

680
01:09:04,661 --> 01:09:07,221
Just this one day?

681
01:09:08,861 --> 01:09:10,897
I'll be here.

682
01:09:26,221 --> 01:09:29,372
Where will you go...
later?

683
01:09:31,101 --> 01:09:33,535
To where I am needed.

684
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:39,259
A special evening with the Major.

685
01:09:39,381 --> 01:09:41,656
Good conversation.

686
01:09:41,781 --> 01:09:43,583
He told me that he adores me.

687
01:09:43,584 --> 01:09:45,820
And that he doesn't care
about anything else.

688
01:09:47,381 --> 01:09:51,579
Other than the Germans, the Russian
men really appreciate educated women.

689
01:09:54,581 --> 01:09:57,812
But the war hasn't ended yet.

690
01:09:58,181 --> 01:09:59,205
Excuse me.

691
01:09:59,206 --> 01:10:04,734
Have you got a minute to spare?
We could use your help.

692
01:10:10,101 --> 01:10:12,141
Come on, kiddos,
let's get out of here.

693
01:10:12,142 --> 01:10:14,333
We will finish building
this tower of yours.

694
01:10:20,021 --> 01:10:22,057
That's him.

695
01:10:29,181 --> 01:10:30,216
Good day.

696
01:10:32,541 --> 01:10:34,657
You Russian?

697
01:10:36,661 --> 01:10:37,810
Translate.

698
01:10:55,021 --> 01:10:58,491
The German army came to my village

699
01:11:09,421 --> 01:11:11,730
and killed all the children.

700
01:11:16,261 --> 01:11:18,821
They have...

701
01:11:22,061 --> 01:11:23,289
...stabbed them to death,

702
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:34,294
took their bodies at the ankles...

703
01:11:41,221 --> 01:11:42,290
Continue!

704
01:11:43,381 --> 01:11:45,292
...and smashed their skulls...

705
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:02,579
...on the walls...

706
01:12:10,581 --> 01:12:11,980
...of the houses.

707
01:12:20,581 --> 01:12:22,617
Have you heard that?

708
01:12:22,781 --> 01:12:24,100
Or did you see it with your own eyes?

709
01:12:28,701 --> 01:12:30,692
I saw it.

710
01:12:40,701 --> 01:12:42,771
Hey! Why so fast?

711
01:12:42,861 --> 01:12:45,659
Have you forgotten your panties?

712
01:12:55,221 --> 01:12:57,177
(Russian)

713
01:13:02,381 --> 01:13:07,296
(woman) You speak Russian,
so tell him he needs to stop that.

714
01:13:09,181 --> 01:13:12,014
You speak Russian, right?

715
01:13:21,621 --> 01:13:25,819
Move it, you slut!
Go.

716
01:13:39,021 --> 01:13:41,012
(Music)

717
01:13:50,621 --> 01:13:52,577
(Russian)

718
01:14:03,381 --> 01:14:05,941
Where are you going?

719
01:14:07,501 --> 01:14:10,334
I've been waiting for you.

720
01:14:13,861 --> 01:14:16,819
What's wrong with you?

721
01:14:17,381 --> 01:14:19,849
Comrade Major!

722
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:31,339
The old Germany is coming to an end.

723
01:14:38,461 --> 01:14:40,656
Stay away from him!

724
01:14:41,061 --> 01:14:42,619
He is coming to me,

725
01:14:42,901 --> 01:14:44,539
not the other way round.

726
01:14:45,501 --> 01:14:47,173
Go away.

727
01:14:47,421 --> 01:14:49,377
Why?

728
01:14:52,981 --> 01:14:55,779
You Germans have hanged his wife.

729
01:15:04,621 --> 01:15:06,577
(Music)

730
01:15:17,101 --> 01:15:24,098
(Announcement) Attention! On April 30th,
1945, the Fuhrer committed suicide.

731
01:15:25,661 --> 01:15:30,894
He deserted all of us who have
pledged allegiance to him.

732
01:15:32,461 --> 01:15:36,010
Following the orders of the Fuhrer,
you still believe it's your duty

733
01:15:36,581 --> 01:15:40,654
to defend Berlin although
the supply of heavy armory,

734
01:15:41,341 --> 01:15:46,335
ammunition and your position make
this fight utterly pointless.

735
01:15:47,541 --> 01:15:49,657
With every hour you continue to fight,

736
01:15:49,781 --> 01:15:54,935
you prolong the horrible suffering
of the civil population of Berlin...

737
01:15:55,141 --> 01:15:56,658
and our wounded soldiers.

738
01:15:56,659 --> 01:16:00,056
From now on, everybody who
dies in the battle for Berlin

739
01:16:01,021 --> 01:16:03,854
will have sacrificed
their lives in vain.

740
01:16:04,621 --> 01:16:09,456
In accordance with the leaders
of the Soviet army I prompt you

741
01:16:10,381 --> 01:16:13,532
to cease all fighting immediately.

742
01:16:15,261 --> 01:16:22,372
Breitling, Artillery General and
commanding officer of the Berlin defense.

743
01:16:33,621 --> 01:16:38,092
Fellow soldiers and officers
of the 8th guard army.

744
01:16:39,061 --> 01:16:40,779
This morning,

745
01:16:40,901 --> 01:16:42,698
the Berlin garrison...

746
01:16:42,741 --> 01:16:45,255
...has capitulated.

747
01:16:46,381 --> 01:16:47,939
Berlin...

748
01:16:49,781 --> 01:16:52,011
is defeated.

749
01:16:53,901 --> 01:16:55,459
I've told you we would make it!

750
01:16:59,421 --> 01:17:01,696
(Russian national anthem)

751
01:17:16,461 --> 01:17:18,417
(Undiscernible)

752
01:17:56,741 --> 01:17:58,697
(Soldiers singing the
Russian national anthem)

753
01:18:26,621 --> 01:18:29,579
I'll join my fellow Germans.

754
01:18:31,101 --> 01:18:33,057
Go to Siberia?

755
01:18:36,461 --> 01:18:38,417
What about us?

756
01:18:53,381 --> 01:18:57,090
Talk to me, Friedrich, please!

757
01:18:58,141 --> 01:19:00,701
Talk to me.

758
01:19:03,021 --> 01:19:05,854
I've been waiting for you.

759
01:19:06,701 --> 01:19:09,534
I have prayed and hoped,

760
01:19:11,621 --> 01:19:14,852
prayed and hoped.

761
01:19:16,141 --> 01:19:18,701
No I want you to fulfill

762
01:19:19,221 --> 01:19:24,056
some of those hopes for me.

763
01:19:45,701 --> 01:19:47,737
(cheering)

764
01:19:59,941 --> 01:20:04,969
Hurray, comrades!
To our victory!

765
01:20:05,261 --> 01:20:08,094
Berlin is defeated!

766
01:20:08,301 --> 01:20:11,338
To our home country!

767
01:20:15,421 --> 01:20:17,730
Long live the Red Army!

768
01:20:18,301 --> 01:20:22,692
Long live Stalin!

769
01:20:49,021 --> 01:20:51,979
(Lieutenant)
Hold on, wait a second.

770
01:20:55,741 --> 01:20:58,699
What have we here?
Two halibuts.

771
01:21:01,221 --> 01:21:06,375
- That's incredible.
- Hitler, Goebbels, kaput.

772
01:21:09,621 --> 01:21:11,577
That's great!
Let's drink.

773
01:21:15,261 --> 01:21:17,252
(piano music)

774
01:22:08,261 --> 01:22:10,616
Capitulation.

775
01:22:10,741 --> 01:22:13,574
The time has come.

776
01:22:13,781 --> 01:22:16,614
The war is over.

777
01:22:16,781 --> 01:22:20,757
Us women have been looking
forward to this day so much.

778
01:22:20,758 --> 01:22:20,899
So how does it feel?

779
01:22:21,021 --> 01:22:23,979
Bitter, bitter defeat.

780
01:22:26,621 --> 01:22:31,172
More and more people report
gruesome things.

781
01:22:31,701 --> 01:22:36,252
I sense an alien, hard-to-grasp
something in the air,

782
01:22:38,021 --> 01:22:40,854
mean and threatening.

783
01:22:43,741 --> 01:22:46,938
I don't want to think
about that right now.

784
01:22:47,901 --> 01:22:49,892
(Russian)

785
01:22:52,701 --> 01:22:54,657
It's over.

786
01:22:54,901 --> 01:22:56,619
I don't know...

787
01:22:57,341 --> 01:23:00,777
I'm afraid misfortune has still
some tricks up its sleeves.

788
01:23:07,461 --> 01:23:09,497
(Russian)

789
01:23:15,261 --> 01:23:17,013
Do you hear that?

790
01:23:17,341 --> 01:23:20,299
They drink and smoke like men.

791
01:23:24,061 --> 01:23:27,610
There are 1 million women
in the Russian army.

792
01:23:29,221 --> 01:23:33,180
They come from everywhere.
We don't have uniforms for them.

793
01:23:33,981 --> 01:23:38,293
Boots are too big.
Shirts and jackets, a disaster.

794
01:23:39,861 --> 01:23:43,820
Once a woman came to me,
Ljuba was her name I think.

795
01:23:43,941 --> 01:23:48,571
She says: "Comrade Major,
I believe I will fall today.

796
01:23:49,061 --> 01:23:53,896
"I want new clothes." I say:
"No, you are with us a long time.

797
01:23:54,021 --> 01:23:58,412
"Bullets just avoid you."
Two hours later, she comes again.

798
01:23:58,541 --> 01:24:01,374
And again. Then I tell her:

799
01:24:02,381 --> 01:24:08,013
"Then the new shirt,
with ties white as snow,

800
01:24:09,261 --> 01:24:11,821
it would be spoiled by the blood."

801
01:24:13,501 --> 01:24:18,060
All female soldiers fear that when
they die, they don't look pretty.

802
01:24:22,527 --> 01:24:25,087
Are you a fascist?

803
01:24:34,687 --> 01:24:36,996
What are you looking for?

804
01:24:37,127 --> 01:24:38,879
All occupied.

805
01:24:45,927 --> 01:24:48,680
And the battalion commander?

806
01:24:54,887 --> 01:24:57,355
That's what I like
about you Mongols.

807
01:24:59,007 --> 01:25:02,397
Not a single unnecessary word.

808
01:25:09,247 --> 01:25:11,283
1678 days...

809
01:25:11,367 --> 01:25:14,086
since I've been in this war.

810
01:25:19,847 --> 01:25:21,963
And now...

811
01:25:28,727 --> 01:25:30,638
And she...

812
01:25:31,687 --> 01:25:33,678
she's a whore.

813
01:25:33,847 --> 01:25:35,644
Am I right?

814
01:25:37,807 --> 01:25:39,365
This whole place...

815
01:25:39,447 --> 01:25:42,041
is a brothel!

816
01:25:55,887 --> 01:25:57,843
(door opening)

817
01:26:30,887 --> 01:26:33,959
You come with me.
Move it, you pig.

818
01:26:36,847 --> 01:26:39,494
A pistol, huh? Bastard!

819
01:26:39,495 --> 01:26:40,760
Peace, huh?

820
01:26:41,007 --> 01:26:42,076
Don't!

821
01:26:45,207 --> 01:26:47,163
War kaput!

822
01:26:51,567 --> 01:26:52,920
I said, move it!

823
01:26:53,607 --> 01:26:54,596
Everybody downstairs.

824
01:26:56,207 --> 01:26:57,162
Hurry!

825
01:27:03,727 --> 01:27:05,046
All of you, downstairs.

826
01:27:05,647 --> 01:27:06,841
Hurry!

827
01:27:07,047 --> 01:27:08,560
Faster.

828
01:27:10,127 --> 01:27:11,116
Quick!

829
01:27:14,247 --> 01:27:16,158
Don't move.

830
01:27:18,487 --> 01:27:20,443
Where you get weapons?

831
01:27:26,007 --> 01:27:28,840
Whose apartment is that?

832
01:27:32,967 --> 01:27:33,922
Who?

833
01:27:35,367 --> 01:27:36,322
It's mine.

834
01:27:45,567 --> 01:27:46,841
Is that hers?

835
01:27:47,567 --> 01:27:48,886
It's hers.

836
01:27:49,727 --> 01:27:53,436
That is crime against
decree of Red Army.

837
01:27:54,367 --> 01:27:56,403
Long live the Fuhrer.

838
01:27:57,287 --> 01:27:58,879
Eliminate her.

839
01:27:59,767 --> 01:28:02,327
You can all go to hell.

840
01:28:05,567 --> 01:28:08,400
Did you know about weapons?

841
01:28:11,447 --> 01:28:14,723
- No.
- Go back to apartment.

842
01:28:15,287 --> 01:28:16,347
Shoot them all!

843
01:28:16,687 --> 01:28:17,743
Go now.

844
01:28:17,887 --> 01:28:18,807
Stop.

845
01:28:18,907 --> 01:28:20,525
They're liars, all of them!

846
01:28:20,726 --> 01:28:21,696
Shoot them.

847
01:28:25,087 --> 01:28:26,267
Leave this woman.

848
01:28:26,567 --> 01:28:27,647
She is a Hitler broad.

849
01:28:27,887 --> 01:28:29,615
Do you understand?

850
01:28:29,716 --> 01:28:29,920
No.

851
01:28:30,927 --> 01:28:33,316
First she will be interrogated.

852
01:28:34,167 --> 01:28:36,100
Do you understand?

853
01:28:36,327 --> 01:28:37,567
What are you doing, brother?

854
01:28:38,567 --> 01:28:41,320
This woman has sheltered
an armed soldier.

855
01:28:41,367 --> 01:28:42,807
The punishment for that is death.

856
01:28:42,947 --> 01:28:44,138
Go, now!

857
01:28:50,927 --> 01:28:53,680
I'll have to report this.

858
01:28:54,367 --> 01:28:57,279
Burn them alive!

859
01:29:04,647 --> 01:29:09,516
How could you risk our lives like that?
Now we are sold down the river.

860
01:29:09,967 --> 01:29:12,003
(Russian)

861
01:29:36,807 --> 01:29:38,479
Traitor!

862
01:29:52,407 --> 01:29:57,686
I own whole Berlin! Hotel Adlon,
Wedding, Kaiserdamm!

863
01:29:58,167 --> 01:30:00,886
Red flags everywhere.

864
01:30:01,087 --> 01:30:04,363
Red flags.
Pretty flags, good quality.

865
01:30:06,927 --> 01:30:08,963
What is it?

866
01:30:12,687 --> 01:30:13,802
Quarrel?

867
01:30:25,287 --> 01:30:26,436
What are you looking at?

868
01:30:26,887 --> 01:30:28,718
Get out of my sight.

869
01:30:33,047 --> 01:30:34,082
Hey, what's up?

870
01:30:35,047 --> 01:30:36,116
To victory, Commander.

871
01:30:36,807 --> 01:30:38,479
To Stalin and our victory.

872
01:30:39,047 --> 01:30:40,366
Wait.
You should stay with your people.

873
01:30:40,647 --> 01:30:42,558
The war is over.

874
01:30:44,367 --> 01:30:46,562
Here! I get it.

875
01:30:47,327 --> 01:30:48,727
Look...

876
01:30:48,927 --> 01:30:50,797
Lyoba, Marina, Olga.

877
01:30:53,327 --> 01:30:54,476
They love me,

878
01:30:55,327 --> 01:30:56,726
all of them.

879
01:30:58,007 --> 01:30:59,963
Everything all right?

880
01:31:02,407 --> 01:31:04,363
Do you want something to eat?

881
01:31:16,127 --> 01:31:22,282
Here. What's better? You tell me.
His dick or my bicycle?

882
01:31:24,367 --> 01:31:25,402
And you, get out of here...

883
01:31:25,527 --> 01:31:27,245
before I shoot your nuts off!

884
01:31:29,287 --> 01:31:30,327
You, listen!

885
01:31:30,767 --> 01:31:31,948
We celebrate.

886
01:31:32,149 --> 01:31:34,291
Everybody come, whole house.

887
01:31:34,292 --> 01:31:35,036
Order!

888
01:31:37,127 --> 01:31:41,325
Your Hitler is not human.
He is a stinking pile of turd.

889
01:31:43,487 --> 01:31:44,556
Not human.

890
01:31:45,167 --> 01:31:46,361
Turd!

891
01:31:47,767 --> 01:31:50,174
Lenchen, Lenchen!
Trouble upstairs!

892
01:31:50,175 --> 01:31:52,238
(Andrey) Everyone, come now.

893
01:31:53,327 --> 01:31:54,316
Order!

894
01:31:56,287 --> 01:31:57,515
Fill the glasses.

895
01:31:58,087 --> 01:31:59,315
What are you standing there?

896
01:31:59,407 --> 01:32:00,999
We've got guests.

897
01:32:11,847 --> 01:32:13,803
Why fear?

898
01:32:19,007 --> 01:32:20,963
(Music)

899
01:32:25,087 --> 01:32:28,238
Look down there.
What do you see?

900
01:32:30,647 --> 01:32:32,000
Soldiers.

901
01:32:33,567 --> 01:32:37,116
Russians! Beasts.
Or animals, like you call us.

902
01:32:38,247 --> 01:32:40,203
And you're right.

903
01:32:40,327 --> 01:32:46,402
None of us is hesitating a single
second if we can shoot a German.

904
01:32:47,527 --> 01:32:50,758
Your blood is on our uniforms.

905
01:32:51,127 --> 01:32:54,199
Is good as it is.
None of them wanted war!

906
01:32:55,527 --> 01:32:59,315
Most of them didn't even
know what that is, Germany.

907
01:33:02,887 --> 01:33:05,799
Now come with me.

908
01:33:10,167 --> 01:33:12,157
What is happening here?

909
01:33:12,158 --> 01:33:14,319
Careful, that's mahogany.

910
01:33:15,167 --> 01:33:17,601
Let me go!

911
01:33:17,727 --> 01:33:19,683
(Russian)

912
01:33:21,807 --> 01:33:25,243
- You dance. Dance!
- How dare you?

913
01:33:25,367 --> 01:33:28,630
This is my living room
and not a dance hall.

914
01:33:28,631 --> 01:33:29,645
You understand?

915
01:33:29,807 --> 01:33:32,765
- That is fantastic.
- No dance hall!

916
01:33:33,047 --> 01:33:36,596
Drink Schnapps, Vodka.
Schnapps good.

917
01:33:39,967 --> 01:33:41,036
You.

918
01:33:48,847 --> 01:33:52,681
Sing? Now he wants me to sing.
I won't sing now.

919
01:33:54,367 --> 01:33:57,325
- What does he want?
- Well, have a guess.

920
01:33:57,887 --> 01:33:58,842
No.

921
01:33:59,047 --> 01:34:00,480
What does that mean, "no"?

922
01:34:02,807 --> 01:34:05,719
That is Europe!
That is Europe!

923
01:34:06,367 --> 01:34:07,720
Drink, drink.

924
01:34:09,647 --> 01:34:10,687
Why not?

925
01:34:10,887 --> 01:34:12,757
I'm looking at you.

926
01:34:12,807 --> 01:34:14,877
And you?
Nothing.

927
01:34:21,047 --> 01:34:22,560
Well, maybe next time.

928
01:34:23,487 --> 01:34:24,636
To you.

929
01:34:39,687 --> 01:34:41,678
I Anatol.

930
01:34:43,367 --> 01:34:46,200
- I know.
- Brbel.

931
01:34:47,127 --> 01:34:51,803
My heart calls Brbel.

932
01:34:53,087 --> 01:34:56,124
Brbel, Brbel, Brbel.

933
01:34:56,847 --> 01:34:58,803
(Music)

934
01:35:08,007 --> 01:35:10,123
I play the fiddle.

935
01:35:10,247 --> 01:35:12,283
Violin. Violin?

936
01:35:12,927 --> 01:35:14,519
You play the piano?

937
01:35:14,607 --> 01:35:16,833
In an orchestra,
but not any more.

938
01:35:16,834 --> 01:35:18,077
The violin is lost.

939
01:35:18,647 --> 01:35:21,480
That's good.
I'd like to play the piano, too.

940
01:35:27,647 --> 01:35:30,480
Why don't you go upstairs?

941
01:35:31,167 --> 01:35:35,638
- Should I?
- Yes, have some fun.

942
01:35:38,647 --> 01:35:41,480
We all need that.

943
01:35:42,127 --> 01:35:44,687
Do you come with me?

944
01:35:44,847 --> 01:35:46,075
Later.

945
01:35:47,567 --> 01:35:49,558
- Sure?
- Yes.

946
01:35:55,727 --> 01:35:58,560
It's good that you are here.

947
01:36:05,807 --> 01:36:07,843
(undiscernible)

948
01:36:17,167 --> 01:36:19,635
I want to embrace you

949
01:36:19,767 --> 01:36:22,327
my whole life.

950
01:36:25,047 --> 01:36:27,880
I am here, you're in Moscow.

951
01:36:29,967 --> 01:36:32,800
Nobody has arms that long.

952
01:36:33,487 --> 01:36:35,443
Try it.

953
01:36:42,207 --> 01:36:47,235
The Major asked me to call him Andrej.
"Why not?", I said.

954
01:36:47,367 --> 01:36:51,326
"The war is over."
He looked at me for a long while.

955
01:36:52,567 --> 01:36:56,526
"Every newborn child
cries for war," he said.

956
01:36:57,207 --> 01:37:01,758
Nothing and nobody, no man,
no nation, will stop this vicious circle.

957
01:37:02,727 --> 01:37:04,683
Only death.

958
01:37:12,607 --> 01:37:15,565
Not so fast,
I am getting sick.

959
01:37:21,327 --> 01:37:23,045
Gee.

960
01:37:25,887 --> 01:37:27,320
Attention.

961
01:37:29,527 --> 01:37:31,722
And now for everybody...

962
01:37:32,087 --> 01:37:35,318
"I in love with you."

963
01:37:37,527 --> 01:37:38,755
Brbel.

964
01:37:43,487 --> 01:37:45,478
(Music)

965
01:38:00,687 --> 01:38:02,643
(humming)

966
01:38:08,807 --> 01:38:10,320
Dance.

967
01:38:15,487 --> 01:38:17,717
Come on, let's go.

968
01:38:25,007 --> 01:38:28,886
We are not a people any more,
we're only "the population".

969
01:38:29,007 --> 01:38:32,761
I am talking about individuals
that form within a democracy.

970
01:38:32,887 --> 01:38:36,846
The ones who get the economy going.
Economic upswing.

971
01:39:02,647 --> 01:39:05,480
Dance, dance, you come.

972
01:39:10,007 --> 01:39:12,821
I think we should look at
the greater picture here.

973
01:39:12,822 --> 01:39:15,365
The countries of Europe
will burst their borders.

974
01:39:15,487 --> 01:39:19,400
They will grow into larger areas.
The victorious super powers will,

975
01:39:19,527 --> 01:39:22,485
just like Napoleon did,
re-order the political world map.

976
01:39:22,847 --> 01:39:27,079
So we will become a Soviet republic
with planned economy, huh?

977
01:39:39,527 --> 01:39:40,562
Thanks.

978
01:39:43,127 --> 01:39:47,006
Well, Mr. Hoch, everything all right?
We need to think practical now.

979
01:39:47,127 --> 01:39:50,961
Let's start the every day life again,
and we will soon get into the groove.

980
01:39:54,487 --> 01:39:55,442
Slow down.

981
01:40:17,607 --> 01:40:18,756
Drink.

982
01:40:30,367 --> 01:40:32,801
The Soviet Union is just at
the beginning of its evolution.

983
01:40:34,007 --> 01:40:36,567
The future will prove that.

984
01:40:39,487 --> 01:40:41,876
You love your country.

985
01:40:42,647 --> 01:40:44,922
Just as I love mine.

986
01:40:53,167 --> 01:40:56,000
My mother once said that one day,

987
01:40:56,487 --> 01:41:00,321
I would marry a man
who played the piano.

988
01:41:08,607 --> 01:41:11,997
Everybody has been wondering
what this day would be like.

989
01:41:14,127 --> 01:41:16,322
I haven't.

990
01:41:17,327 --> 01:41:19,682
Never.

991
01:41:27,567 --> 01:41:30,957
I didn't want to experience it.

992
01:41:36,487 --> 01:41:39,524
Why not?

993
01:41:54,167 --> 01:41:58,683
If you don't do it, Andrej,
I will tell you something.

994
01:42:04,167 --> 01:42:08,285
War is changing the words.

995
01:42:12,727 --> 01:42:17,847
"Love" is not what it used to be.

996
01:42:24,327 --> 01:42:26,283
And yet,

997
01:42:29,847 --> 01:42:32,407
in spite of that,

998
01:42:33,567 --> 01:42:37,925
I want that my husband finds the
same wife that he left behind

999
01:42:37,967 --> 01:42:40,400
when he returns.

1000
01:42:45,687 --> 01:42:47,643
Please stay.

1001
01:42:51,527 --> 01:42:53,483
(Music)

1002
01:43:08,407 --> 01:43:12,366
Us women,
we are branded for life.

1003
01:43:13,767 --> 01:43:17,999
But for here and now,
right in this moment,

1004
01:43:19,367 --> 01:43:22,325
I feel fantastic.

1005
01:43:31,127 --> 01:43:34,085
I'll go and get us some tea.
Ilse still has some left.

1006
01:44:04,967 --> 01:44:06,923
(door opening)

1007
01:44:09,567 --> 01:44:13,162
Morning, Lenchen!
Anybody up?

1008
01:44:19,287 --> 01:44:22,245
- Where is your Wanja?
- Working.

1009
01:44:23,447 --> 01:44:25,403
And mummy?

1010
01:44:30,687 --> 01:44:31,722
Ilse?

1011
01:44:33,607 --> 01:44:34,562
Ilse?

1012
01:44:37,767 --> 01:44:39,325
Ilse?

1013
01:44:41,407 --> 01:44:43,363
(Ilse crying)

1014
01:44:56,007 --> 01:44:57,406
Ilse.

1015
01:44:58,727 --> 01:45:01,287
Ilse, get away from him.

1016
01:45:14,367 --> 01:45:16,085
(Screaming)

1017
01:45:16,167 --> 01:45:19,045
Gerd, do you remember?
It was on a Tuesday.

1018
01:45:19,167 --> 01:45:21,601
We went to see Felix.

1019
01:45:21,727 --> 01:45:24,685
You could smell the tree resin.

1020
01:45:25,287 --> 01:45:29,246
We came across a cloud of butterflies.

1021
01:45:31,287 --> 01:45:34,245
And you knew all their names.

1022
01:45:34,687 --> 01:45:40,956
Pea blues, Brimstones, Fire birds,
Swallowtails and many more.

1023
01:45:45,727 --> 01:45:48,413
One was taking a sunbath
right there on the path,

1024
01:45:48,414 --> 01:45:50,562
it was velvety brown and
yellow with a blue hem.

1025
01:45:51,167 --> 01:45:54,125
You called it a Mourning Cloak.

1026
01:46:01,527 --> 01:46:03,483
(Music)

1027
01:46:21,727 --> 01:46:25,285
So many things I've
been given in my life.

1028
01:46:25,286 --> 01:46:26,278
In abundance.

1029
01:46:26,407 --> 01:46:29,365
The Major had lost everything.

1030
01:46:29,647 --> 01:46:32,525
Damn Russian idealist.

1031
01:46:32,647 --> 01:46:36,526
He takes it all like he
wants the world to be.

1032
01:46:36,647 --> 01:46:39,480
Soviet apostle.

1033
01:46:42,087 --> 01:46:43,581
I like him though.

1034
01:46:43,682 --> 01:46:47,400
The less he wants from me,
the more I like him.

1035
01:46:49,007 --> 01:46:50,076
Very much.

1036
01:46:58,247 --> 01:46:59,316
Andrej.

1037
01:47:01,727 --> 01:47:02,716
Andrej.

1038
01:47:32,567 --> 01:47:35,400
Andrej isn't here any more.

1039
01:47:37,127 --> 01:47:38,640
Relocated.

1040
01:47:45,167 --> 01:47:46,236
To where?

1041
01:47:51,047 --> 01:47:52,446
Unknown.

1042
01:47:54,807 --> 01:47:56,081
Good-bye.

1043
01:48:56,687 --> 01:48:59,645
"The birds so quiet,
the bells are silent."

1044
01:49:00,000 --> 01:49:03,000
(from "18 Little Songs of the
Bitter Homeland" by Yiannis Ritsos)

1045
01:49:03,447 --> 01:49:06,007
Isn't that how it goes?

1046
01:49:23,207 --> 01:49:24,481
Please, sit down.

1047
01:49:49,927 --> 01:49:51,963
The studio,

1048
01:49:53,807 --> 01:49:55,763
is that gone?

1049
01:50:08,567 --> 01:50:11,525
- I don't live here alone.
- I know.

1050
01:50:15,367 --> 01:50:17,835
Ukrainians like that.

1051
01:51:08,807 --> 01:51:11,640
Here, that's for you.

1052
01:52:15,887 --> 01:52:18,447
You are shameless.

1053
01:52:18,767 --> 01:52:21,327
Don't you see that?

1054
01:52:24,767 --> 01:52:28,316
It is disgusting
just to look at you.

1055
01:52:39,407 --> 01:52:41,363
(Music)

1056
01:53:17,847 --> 01:53:19,803
(Music)

1057
01:53:26,567 --> 01:53:27,795
Atten-shun!

1058
01:54:01,087 --> 01:54:04,124
- I'd like to thank you.
- For what?

1059
01:54:07,447 --> 01:54:10,405
That I had the chance
to get to know you.

1060
01:54:19,527 --> 01:54:22,360
Take care of yourself.

1061
01:54:38,087 --> 01:54:40,965
How are we supposed to live?

1062
01:55:14,407 --> 01:55:16,398
Eyes front!

1063
01:55:30,207 --> 01:55:33,244
"Relocation," that's what they call it.

1064
01:55:35,007 --> 01:55:37,840
With full honors and merits.

1065
01:55:37,967 --> 01:55:41,437
To Siberia, who knows?

1066
01:56:02,727 --> 01:56:04,080
Gerd.

1067
01:56:05,127 --> 01:56:07,960
My beloved Gerd.

1068
01:56:08,767 --> 01:56:11,565
What shall we do?

1069
01:56:11,687 --> 01:56:14,201
Turn back the wheel of time?

1070
01:56:14,327 --> 01:56:17,285
Back to your very first words?

1071
01:56:18,607 --> 01:56:21,440
"30 minutes", you said.

1072
01:56:25,447 --> 01:56:31,079
"Give me 30 minutes, and you will
never want to leave me again."

1073
01:56:36,647 --> 01:56:38,603
(Music)

1074
01:57:29,567 --> 01:57:31,523
(Music)

1075
01:59:02,607 --> 01:59:03,562
What?

1076
01:59:17,727 --> 01:59:18,796
What?

1077
01:59:25,527 --> 01:59:28,087
No answer.

1078
01:59:28,807 --> 01:59:31,765
Two days later he was gone.

1079
01:59:32,207 --> 01:59:35,085
I don't know if he will come back.

1080
01:59:35,207 --> 01:59:38,649
I am surprised that I am
not suffering more.

1081
01:59:38,650 --> 01:59:39,644
Maybe I am just too busy.

1082
01:59:40,527 --> 01:59:44,076
I need to find a piece of flint stone,

1083
01:59:44,207 --> 01:59:47,193
I need to mop up the
floor of the apartment

1084
01:59:47,194 --> 01:59:50,043
and I am desperately
looking for some flowers.

1085
01:59:50,167 --> 01:59:53,000
Yesterday I found some lilac.

1086
01:59:54,207 --> 01:59:57,040
I wonder if Gerd still thinks about me.

1087
01:59:57,247 --> 01:59:59,203
Who knows?

1088
01:59:59,367 --> 02:00:01,692
Maybe our hearts have
a say in this, too,

1089
02:00:01,893 --> 02:00:05,197
and we'll see each other again,
some day.

1090
02:00:06,567 --> 02:00:07,837
(Music)

1091
02:00:08,207 --> 02:00:12,433
When the diary "A woman in Berlin"
was first released in Germany in 1959,

1092
02:00:12,534 --> 02:00:14,007
it was a huge scandal.

1093
02:00:14,067 --> 02:00:18,237
Many people said that it was a disgrace
and an insult to the German women.

1094
02:00:18,507 --> 02:00:22,105
The author was so shocked by
the rejection and the contempt
that her book received.

1095
02:00:22,606 --> 02:00:26,106
She prohibited any further
releases for as long as she lived.

1096
02:00:26,507 --> 02:00:29,207
And even beyond her death,
here real name was never to be revealed.
