1
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,716
- Good morning, Excellency.
- Good morning, Monsignor.

2
00:04:03,255 --> 00:04:05,780
- Alfeo.
- Stefano.

3
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:11,220
Everyone was shocked at my coming here.

4
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:13,797
They think I'm trying to steal your show.

5
00:04:13,865 --> 00:04:15,457
You've helped make it.

6
00:04:15,534 --> 00:04:18,628
I thought I wouldn't see you
till the ceremony at St. Peter's.

7
00:04:18,703 --> 00:04:19,795
I won't be there.

8
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:23,705
I'm going to Warsaw tonight
to meet with the Cardinals of Vienna...

9
00:04:23,775 --> 00:04:26,676
and I won't be back
till you've left for America.

10
00:04:26,778 --> 00:04:30,339
So I thought I would take this chance
to tell you...

11
00:04:30,549 --> 00:04:33,177
well, nothing really...

12
00:04:33,285 --> 00:04:36,914
just to have a look at you
and our old school...

13
00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:40,656
and slip out of here
as inconspicuously as I can.

14
00:04:41,059 --> 00:04:43,892
I'm glad you decided to forget protocol.

15
00:04:43,962 --> 00:04:46,396
I would have hated not seeing you at all.

16
00:04:46,464 --> 00:04:48,955
- Especially the way things look.
- Yes.

17
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,694
Poland seems to be Hitler's next target.

18
00:04:52,737 --> 00:04:56,138
Once again, we may have a war
to separate us.

19
00:04:58,476 --> 00:05:00,171
God bless you, Stefano.

20
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:57,480
Father Fermoyle.

21
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,349
Your Excellency.

22
00:09:00,618 --> 00:09:02,586
It's a day of glory, Stefano...

23
00:09:02,654 --> 00:09:07,387
though I don't like to think how long
it may be before we see each other again.

24
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:10,090
I don't know when
I'll ever be back in Rome...

25
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:12,891
but perhaps you'll come
to Boston some day, or New York.

26
00:09:12,964 --> 00:09:15,558
It's possible, when this war is over.

27
00:09:15,633 --> 00:09:18,761
I'm more likely to travel
in my new post at the Vatican...

28
00:09:18,837 --> 00:09:21,032
than I was as a seminary lector.

29
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:22,698
But, you'll come back to Rome.

30
00:09:22,774 --> 00:09:25,265
Most parish priests in America
don't get the chance.

31
00:09:25,343 --> 00:09:27,811
You will not be like most parish priests.

32
00:09:29,481 --> 00:09:31,312
I've read your new chapters.

33
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:35,480
And as usual, I think they are splendid.
But as usual...

34
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,788
that hasn't stopped me from writing...

35
00:09:37,856 --> 00:09:41,815
almost as many pages of notes
as there are in the manuscript.

36
00:09:43,394 --> 00:09:46,329
- You must finish this book, Stefano.
- I intend to.

37
00:09:46,731 --> 00:09:50,258
I just hope wherever I'm sent,
it isn't too far from a decent library.

38
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,496
You will manage, even in America.

39
00:09:52,871 --> 00:09:54,338
Over the years...

40
00:09:54,405 --> 00:09:57,499
I had very few students
with your special talents.

41
00:09:58,343 --> 00:10:00,004
Not only scholarship.

42
00:10:00,712 --> 00:10:03,180
I've watched how you handle people.

43
00:10:03,882 --> 00:10:07,909
I have even watched how you handle me.

44
00:10:08,786 --> 00:10:11,050
If you noticed, then it wasn't very skillful.

45
00:10:11,122 --> 00:10:13,647
I am an unusually observant man.

46
00:10:14,125 --> 00:10:17,185
Seriously, Stefano, I expect a lot from you.

47
00:10:17,862 --> 00:10:21,320
You have a fine mind,
and a way of coming to grips with life...

48
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:23,196
that is, well, Roman.

49
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:26,727
Your Excellency couldn't have chosen
a word to flatter me more.

50
00:10:26,804 --> 00:10:30,365
But you also have a drive
that can be described only as American.

51
00:10:30,742 --> 00:10:32,403
It makes a good mixture.

52
00:10:32,911 --> 00:10:34,936
We need that drive over here.

53
00:10:35,013 --> 00:10:37,277
We need it now, in this war...

54
00:10:37,348 --> 00:10:40,374
if the Kaiser and his partners
are ever to be defeated.

55
00:10:40,451 --> 00:10:43,852
Do you think it will happen that way,
America join the Allies?

56
00:10:44,322 --> 00:10:46,552
As an Italian, I hope so, but...

57
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:49,950
what a nation will do is hard to predict.

58
00:10:50,428 --> 00:10:53,056
Even for a member
of the Vatican Diplomatic Corps?

59
00:10:53,131 --> 00:10:55,565
As of today, I'm still a teacher...

60
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:58,693
and I make predictions
only about my students.

61
00:11:00,438 --> 00:11:02,167
You know the ring I wear?

62
00:11:03,508 --> 00:11:06,500
This one also was designed
by Dolcettiano...

63
00:11:06,878 --> 00:11:08,812
in the great days of Florence.

64
00:11:09,881 --> 00:11:12,349
Three times in as many centuries...

65
00:11:12,951 --> 00:11:16,978
there have been two bishops at once
in the Quarenghi family to wear them.

66
00:11:17,822 --> 00:11:19,790
But when my brother died...

67
00:11:20,058 --> 00:11:22,583
that was the end of the tradition.

68
00:11:24,062 --> 00:11:26,326
I want you to have his ring, Stefano.

69
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,426
I couldn't.

70
00:11:31,202 --> 00:11:32,396
A bishop's ring?

71
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,596
Not for now.

72
00:11:34,973 --> 00:11:36,702
For when the day comes.

73
00:11:39,477 --> 00:11:40,842
Keep it for then.

74
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:19,649
There he is! Steve!

75
00:12:19,884 --> 00:12:21,545
- Do you see him?
- Steve!

76
00:12:28,926 --> 00:12:30,723
Okay, Father, go ahead.

77
00:12:36,668 --> 00:12:38,101
Florrie.

78
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:40,999
Hello, Frank.

79
00:12:42,473 --> 00:12:43,997
Monie!

80
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:47,205
Is that really my little sister?

81
00:12:47,278 --> 00:12:48,745
Notice anything different?

82
00:12:48,813 --> 00:12:51,179
As a priest, I guess I should say no...

83
00:12:51,249 --> 00:12:53,740
but I'm not supposed to tell lies, either.

84
00:12:55,553 --> 00:12:56,815
Where's Dad?

85
00:13:16,908 --> 00:13:20,969
I hear the clergy travels free of charge
on Dennis Fermoyle's car.

86
00:13:21,312 --> 00:13:22,802
Is that a fact, now?

87
00:13:22,914 --> 00:13:24,506
The hell, you say!

88
00:13:24,816 --> 00:13:25,805
Steve!

89
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,176
Hello, Dad.

90
00:13:27,251 --> 00:13:29,344
Look at him now, will you?

91
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:32,685
Stiff as a board, he is,
in that fine Italian suit.

92
00:13:32,757 --> 00:13:37,524
But no matter, we'll soon wilt the
Roman starch from that collar of yours.

93
00:13:38,162 --> 00:13:41,256
Dad's already talked to his old buddy,
Monsignor Monaghan.

94
00:13:41,332 --> 00:13:43,766
"Don't make it too easy for my boy,"
Dad said...

95
00:13:43,835 --> 00:13:45,427
"not good for his character."

96
00:13:45,503 --> 00:13:46,765
I said no such thing.

97
00:13:46,838 --> 00:13:49,898
He made him promise not to promote you
to bishop the first day.

98
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:51,805
But you're going to be, aren't you?

99
00:13:51,876 --> 00:13:52,968
He can't avoid it.

100
00:13:53,044 --> 00:13:56,673
It's nearly impossible to make cardinal,
unless you're a bishop first.

101
00:13:57,048 --> 00:13:59,209
Now pay your fares, the lot of you.

102
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:02,345
This is no politician looking after his own.

103
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,947
You get no favors from your father
on the Boston Municipal.

104
00:14:06,557 --> 00:14:09,390
How well the new plaster
and wood matches the old.

105
00:14:09,861 --> 00:14:11,920
They all comment on it, Corny.

106
00:14:11,996 --> 00:14:13,554
And what do you say to that?

107
00:14:13,631 --> 00:14:17,431
The job was done by the Cornelius
J. Deegan Construction Company...

108
00:14:17,502 --> 00:14:20,232
without charge,
as a donation to the parish.

109
00:14:20,705 --> 00:14:22,639
That's telling 'em, Monsignor...

110
00:14:22,707 --> 00:14:26,165
but let me give you some of my cards
for next time it comes up.

111
00:14:27,412 --> 00:14:30,347
They remember the name better
if they see it written.

112
00:14:30,415 --> 00:14:31,347
Thank you.

113
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:33,884
I'll see they find their way
to the right pockets.

114
00:14:33,951 --> 00:14:35,111
You do that.

115
00:14:44,796 --> 00:14:48,698
I was forgetting to mention our drive
for a new heating system.

116
00:14:49,267 --> 00:14:50,598
You mentioned it.

117
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:53,728
You'll be posting a list of the contributors,
no doubt.

118
00:14:53,805 --> 00:14:57,104
So I have to give what people expect
from a Papal Knight.

119
00:14:58,009 --> 00:15:01,968
I don't know if you knew, Stephen,
I was sent a decoration from the Pope.

120
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:03,340
Knights of Malta.

121
00:15:03,414 --> 00:15:05,177
Yes, my father wrote me about it.

122
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:08,047
Did he, now?
And how's old Din coming along?

123
00:15:08,186 --> 00:15:11,451
Bursting out of his britches, I daresay,
with pride over you.

124
00:15:11,522 --> 00:15:12,989
Give him my best, will you?

125
00:15:13,057 --> 00:15:15,890
And tell him it's the old days
I'm missing yet...

126
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:20,090
before I was rich enough to become
the white-headed boy of this parish.

127
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:35,203
Look at the size of it, will you?

128
00:15:36,113 --> 00:15:39,241
Raising money is a necessary part
of running a parish, I guess.

129
00:15:39,317 --> 00:15:43,811
If that fancy training of yours didn't cover
the care in handling of millionaires...

130
00:15:43,888 --> 00:15:45,981
what is it they were teaching you, then?

131
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:48,651
I specialized in ecclesiastical history...

132
00:15:48,726 --> 00:15:51,092
the Reformation period, what led up to it...

133
00:15:51,162 --> 00:15:53,995
which meant learning German,
as well as Italian, of course.

134
00:15:54,065 --> 00:15:55,760
German, as well as Italian, huh?

135
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:59,701
Yes, in fact, I've been working on a book
about the causes of the Reformation...

136
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,796
and the Council of Trent
and the Counter Reformation.

137
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:04,102
Council of Trent?

138
00:16:04,175 --> 00:16:06,439
I feel that the churchmen at the time...

139
00:16:06,511 --> 00:16:09,480
were late in recognizing
both the growth of nationalism...

140
00:16:09,547 --> 00:16:13,540
and the development of scientific thought,
and that hastened the Reformation.

141
00:16:13,618 --> 00:16:17,054
That's the thing that did it, was it?

142
00:16:17,121 --> 00:16:20,613
Of course, nothing is ever quite
that simple or straightforward, but...

143
00:16:20,691 --> 00:16:22,158
I disagree, Father.

144
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,427
Let me give you an example.

145
00:16:24,495 --> 00:16:27,589
The year is 1917,
and this is the city of Boston.

146
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:30,258
Boston, not Rome.

147
00:16:30,568 --> 00:16:32,263
You understand the difference.

148
00:16:32,336 --> 00:16:34,270
That is the church of St. John's...

149
00:16:34,338 --> 00:16:36,306
and you are the new curate here.

150
00:16:36,374 --> 00:16:39,309
All simple, straightforward facts,
are they not?

151
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:40,503
Yes, Monsignor.

152
00:16:40,578 --> 00:16:44,275
I don't suppose during
the course of your elegant education...

153
00:16:44,348 --> 00:16:45,975
you ever drove a milk wagon.

154
00:16:47,151 --> 00:16:48,516
- No.
- I did, as a lad...

155
00:16:49,387 --> 00:16:52,948
and I learned how to tell
a good milk-wagon horse 10 blocks away.

156
00:16:53,824 --> 00:16:55,621
You get my meaning, Father?

157
00:16:56,761 --> 00:16:59,889
She's a milk-wagon horse I'll be wanting
for a curate, Father.

158
00:16:59,964 --> 00:17:02,432
We don't need any racehorses
at St. John's.

159
00:17:05,236 --> 00:17:06,601
The Monsignor...

160
00:17:07,138 --> 00:17:08,662
quite a man, isn't he?

161
00:17:08,739 --> 00:17:10,400
Yes, he is quite a manager.

162
00:17:10,474 --> 00:17:13,443
They don't call him
"Dollar Bill" Monaghan for nothing.

163
00:17:13,678 --> 00:17:16,203
You'll not find the likes of him in Rome.

164
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:19,679
So, which is it that you want to be...

165
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:23,846
a historian or a diplomat,
like your Roman friend...

166
00:17:24,522 --> 00:17:26,114
Bishop Quarenghi.

167
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:28,556
Or a good priest, like Bill Monaghan?

168
00:17:29,961 --> 00:17:31,019
Both.

169
00:17:31,095 --> 00:17:33,825
But if you had to make a choice
between the two?

170
00:17:34,532 --> 00:17:35,794
A good priest.

171
00:17:36,701 --> 00:17:39,568
The very best priest in all the world?

172
00:17:40,438 --> 00:17:42,065
The best priest in the world.

173
00:17:42,139 --> 00:17:44,073
And how do you expect to be that...

174
00:17:44,141 --> 00:17:48,168
when already you are committing
the sin of pride even to think it?

175
00:17:50,781 --> 00:17:53,113
Frank, will you stop that noise?

176
00:17:53,417 --> 00:17:55,112
Don't you get enough of that...

177
00:17:55,186 --> 00:17:58,553
playing in those Scully Square
movie parlors...

178
00:17:58,723 --> 00:18:01,214
till the Lord knows what hour of the night?

179
00:18:01,292 --> 00:18:04,819
Don't worry about me, Dad.
I get plenty of sleep during the day.

180
00:18:05,096 --> 00:18:07,394
Steve, listen to this. It's a new one.

181
00:18:50,174 --> 00:18:51,573
Dinner's ready.

182
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:53,572
Shouldn't we wait for Mona?

183
00:18:53,644 --> 00:18:56,135
She's due back from the library
any minute.

184
00:18:56,313 --> 00:18:57,337
The library?

185
00:18:57,415 --> 00:18:59,883
Is that where she told you she was going?

186
00:19:00,351 --> 00:19:02,342
What you do mean by that, Florrie?

187
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:05,389
I mean, she is more likely out
with lkie Rampbell.

188
00:19:05,956 --> 00:19:08,447
His name's not lkie, it's Benny.

189
00:19:09,093 --> 00:19:10,492
What's the difference?

190
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:12,995
There are enough Catholic boys
in this parish...

191
00:19:13,064 --> 00:19:16,124
without you having to run around
with a rag-picking Jew.

192
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,733
He's not a ragpicker.

193
00:19:17,802 --> 00:19:20,771
He is studying to be a dentist

194
00:19:21,739 --> 00:19:23,138
He's still a Jew.

195
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:26,743
I'm sick and tired of having to do
all the work around here...

196
00:19:26,811 --> 00:19:29,473
while she is out with
that sheeny boyfriend of hers.

197
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:32,414
You like it better not having
any boyfriend at all?

198
00:19:37,188 --> 00:19:38,280
Slut!

199
00:19:58,743 --> 00:20:00,677
Will you go up to Mona, Steve?

200
00:20:00,745 --> 00:20:03,009
You've always had a special way with her.

201
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,980
Yes, you talk to Mona, Steve.

202
00:20:05,683 --> 00:20:07,378
I'll talk to Florrie.

203
00:20:36,914 --> 00:20:38,074
Monie?

204
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:40,874
It's me, Steve.

205
00:20:44,488 --> 00:20:45,853
Monie.

206
00:20:50,761 --> 00:20:52,456
Put your arms around me.

207
00:21:00,204 --> 00:21:02,502
Remember the bear hugs
you used to give me...

208
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:05,337
and I'd take you down Crescent Hill
on my double runner?

209
00:21:05,409 --> 00:21:08,867
Before we'd start, I'd show you
how to put your arms around me...

210
00:21:08,946 --> 00:21:10,106
and I'd say:

211
00:21:10,681 --> 00:21:13,241
"No matter what happens,
just hang on to me."

212
00:21:13,617 --> 00:21:16,142
And you'd say, "I'll hang on, Steve."

213
00:21:21,959 --> 00:21:23,449
What am I gonna do?

214
00:21:24,595 --> 00:21:26,222
I'm in love with Benny.

215
00:21:27,097 --> 00:21:28,587
I want to marry him.

216
00:21:28,933 --> 00:21:30,298
Has he asked you?

217
00:21:31,302 --> 00:21:32,166
Yes.

218
00:21:33,137 --> 00:21:35,162
I asked him to wait.

219
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,701
He won't wait forever.

220
00:21:38,108 --> 00:21:40,702
The difference in faith. It doesn't matter?

221
00:21:40,978 --> 00:21:43,071
Only if it matters to you, Steve.

222
00:21:45,182 --> 00:21:46,672
Does it matter?

223
00:21:47,585 --> 00:21:49,018
I'd like to meet Benny.

224
00:21:49,086 --> 00:21:52,317
Would you bring him over to the rectory
one of these days?

225
00:21:57,161 --> 00:21:59,755
I'm so glad you're back.

226
00:22:00,497 --> 00:22:02,226
You're gonna fix everything.

227
00:22:02,299 --> 00:22:03,994
I'm so glad you're home.

228
00:22:14,245 --> 00:22:16,679
- Father, I've got a bet.
- What about?

229
00:22:16,747 --> 00:22:19,978
Chick, here, says that only Catholics
can get into heaven.

230
00:22:20,417 --> 00:22:22,977
Everyone knows Protestants
can't go to heaven.

231
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:25,214
Why can't Protestants go to heaven?

232
00:22:25,389 --> 00:22:27,254
Does anyone have an answer for that?

233
00:22:27,324 --> 00:22:29,258
- Father!
- Father!

234
00:22:29,326 --> 00:22:30,816
'Cause they ain't Catholics.

235
00:22:30,895 --> 00:22:33,090
How does that strike the rest of you?

236
00:22:33,163 --> 00:22:34,323
He's right!

237
00:22:34,398 --> 00:22:35,763
You're all wrong.

238
00:22:36,367 --> 00:22:39,359
The Catholic Church teaches
that it's possible for anyone...

239
00:22:39,436 --> 00:22:41,370
Protestant, Mohammedan, Jew...

240
00:22:41,605 --> 00:22:45,473
anyone who does God's will according
to his conscience to go to heaven.

241
00:22:45,576 --> 00:22:48,704
Then what's the use of going
to all this trouble to be Catholic?

242
00:22:48,779 --> 00:22:50,610
Yes, Father, what's the use?

243
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:53,082
We'll take that up next Sunday.

244
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,345
I think we've all had enough for today.

245
00:22:55,419 --> 00:22:56,613
Steve.

246
00:22:56,687 --> 00:22:59,087
This is Benny Rampbell.

247
00:22:59,156 --> 00:23:01,488
- How do you do, Benny?
- How do you do, Father?

248
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:04,026
The kid had a point there, don't you think?

249
00:23:04,094 --> 00:23:06,722
Have you ever thought
about becoming Catholic?

250
00:23:07,331 --> 00:23:08,423
You know...

251
00:23:08,499 --> 00:23:12,367
my parents aren't too keen on the idea
of my marrying a Christian, either.

252
00:23:12,436 --> 00:23:15,564
Couldn't we just get married,
and then try to convert each other?

253
00:23:15,639 --> 00:23:16,901
No, you couldn't.

254
00:23:16,974 --> 00:23:20,205
For Mona to marry you at all,
she'd need special dispensation...

255
00:23:20,277 --> 00:23:24,179
and you'd have to pledge not to interfere
with the practice of her religion...

256
00:23:24,248 --> 00:23:26,079
and raise your children as Catholics.

257
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,983
That's not exactly
treating the two things as equal, is it?

258
00:23:29,053 --> 00:23:30,953
It would be hypocritical if we did.

259
00:23:31,021 --> 00:23:33,489
We happen to believe our church
is the only true one.

260
00:23:33,557 --> 00:23:36,219
If you're right,
then your rules make sense.

261
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:37,590
I'm glad you think so.

262
00:23:37,661 --> 00:23:40,892
And, if you're right,
then a guy'd be a fool not to join up.

263
00:23:40,965 --> 00:23:42,330
Would you, Benny?

264
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,425
Steve, I'm in love with your sister.

265
00:23:45,836 --> 00:23:47,201
I want to marry her.

266
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:50,297
So, if my becoming a Catholic
will make that easier...

267
00:23:50,407 --> 00:23:51,601
I'll give it a try.

268
00:23:51,675 --> 00:23:53,074
Benny, I love you.

269
00:23:54,211 --> 00:23:56,338
- Steve, you did it!
- Not yet.

270
00:23:56,413 --> 00:23:58,244
You'll have to work pretty hard.

271
00:23:58,315 --> 00:24:00,442
No Sunday school stuff for me.

272
00:24:00,517 --> 00:24:03,281
I'm up to my neck in what you call
perfidious darkness.

273
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:05,447
We'll do our best to turn on the light.

274
00:24:05,522 --> 00:24:08,252
But hasn't Darwin put
the skids to Genesis?

275
00:24:08,325 --> 00:24:11,692
If he's done it for us,
he's done it for the Jewish faith, too.

276
00:24:11,762 --> 00:24:14,230
Listen, if I was a good Jew,
I wouldn't be here.

277
00:24:14,298 --> 00:24:18,064
I don't see how anyone can square this
Adam-and-Eve business with evolution.

278
00:24:18,135 --> 00:24:19,124
Why not?

279
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:21,603
Good afternoon, Monsignor.

280
00:24:21,672 --> 00:24:23,867
- Father. Benny.
- Good afternoon, sir.

281
00:24:23,941 --> 00:24:26,603
- How're you getting along?
- All right, I guess.

282
00:24:27,011 --> 00:24:28,945
Go ahead, don't let me bother you.

283
00:24:29,013 --> 00:24:31,481
Father Fermoyle was asking you,
"Why not?"

284
00:24:32,383 --> 00:24:34,544
Because they are mutually exclusive.

285
00:24:34,752 --> 00:24:37,585
Not if you separate
what is essential in the Bible.

286
00:24:37,654 --> 00:24:39,849
What affects matters of faith from...

287
00:24:39,923 --> 00:24:43,689
the names and physical details
that don't have to be taken literally.

288
00:24:43,994 --> 00:24:46,827
Dogma is that there is
one pair of first parents...

289
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:49,057
from whom all mankind is descended.

290
00:24:49,233 --> 00:24:50,666
That truth remains...

291
00:24:50,734 --> 00:24:54,295
whether or not evolution was the method
by which God chose to create them.

292
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,202
I've been working on
a similar question that came up when...

293
00:24:58,275 --> 00:24:59,708
Copernicus and Galileo...

294
00:24:59,777 --> 00:25:02,541
made their discoveries
about the mechanics of the universe.

295
00:25:02,613 --> 00:25:03,602
What's that?

296
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,705
It's a book I've been writing...

297
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,615
in my spare time.

298
00:25:08,519 --> 00:25:12,216
I borrowed a quote on the subject
from Bishop Quarenghi, my teacher.

299
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:20,556
Why didn't you say so in the first place?

300
00:25:20,631 --> 00:25:22,724
That makes everything clear.

301
00:25:24,001 --> 00:25:26,492
The Bible teaches not
how the heavens go...

302
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,331
but how to go to heaven.

303
00:25:28,405 --> 00:25:29,872
A pretty phrase, Father...

304
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:33,501
but aren't you getting
a bit away from the usual instruction?

305
00:25:33,577 --> 00:25:36,842
- Benny's a tough nut to crack.
- There's nothing tough about it.

306
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:39,644
What it all amounts to
in the long run, Benny...

307
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:41,239
is faith.

308
00:25:42,519 --> 00:25:44,248
You've got to have faith.

309
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:47,488
Unfortunately, that doesn't seem
to be contagious.

310
00:25:48,258 --> 00:25:49,953
What's going on out there?

311
00:26:00,838 --> 00:26:02,567
What's happened, Father Lyons?

312
00:26:02,639 --> 00:26:04,038
A miracle, it looks like.

313
00:26:04,108 --> 00:26:06,736
There's blood dripping from the statue,
from her heart.

314
00:26:06,810 --> 00:26:10,075
That girl, Elena,
one of the new Italian immigrants...

315
00:26:10,147 --> 00:26:11,944
her husband was stabbed yesterday.

316
00:26:12,015 --> 00:26:14,381
He was dying when they took him
to the hospital.

317
00:26:14,451 --> 00:26:17,011
She prayed to the Blessed Mother
to save him.

318
00:26:17,087 --> 00:26:19,180
She lit a candle in front of the statue.

319
00:26:19,256 --> 00:26:20,951
She went back to the hospital...

320
00:26:21,024 --> 00:26:23,959
and her husband was sitting up in bed,
asking for pasta.

321
00:26:24,027 --> 00:26:25,324
Get over there, quick.

322
00:26:25,395 --> 00:26:29,126
Speak Italian to them, but for heaven's
sake, get them out of the church.

323
00:26:59,496 --> 00:27:02,863
Children of the miraculous Queen
of the heavens...

324
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,867
let us pray.

325
00:27:05,903 --> 00:27:09,395
Let us cover the Blessed Virgin
with flowers.

326
00:27:10,541 --> 00:27:13,032
Let us cover her with the flowers...

327
00:27:13,477 --> 00:27:15,911
of her litanies.

328
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:21,847
Lord, have pity on us.

329
00:27:24,354 --> 00:27:28,654
Lord, have pity on us.
Christ, hear our prayer.

330
00:27:31,295 --> 00:27:33,786
Holy Trinity, one single God.

331
00:27:35,832 --> 00:27:38,960
Son, God, Redeemer of the world.

332
00:27:40,571 --> 00:27:43,165
Holy Spirit, thou art God.

333
00:27:44,508 --> 00:27:46,669
He sure does have a way with them.

334
00:27:46,743 --> 00:27:48,540
Holy Mother of God.

335
00:27:48,779 --> 00:27:50,770
Pray for us.

336
00:27:54,218 --> 00:27:56,618
The miracle of the leaking steam pipe...

337
00:27:56,853 --> 00:28:00,016
courtesy of the Cornelius J.
Deegan Construction Company.

338
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:03,321
And I thought this was a special effort
for my conversion.

339
00:28:03,694 --> 00:28:06,993
It'll be a jolt for those people
when they find out the truth.

340
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:08,759
Maybe they won't have to.

341
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:10,766
You're not gonna tell them?

342
00:28:10,834 --> 00:28:12,563
It's not up to me to tell them.

343
00:28:12,636 --> 00:28:14,001
Come on.

344
00:28:14,071 --> 00:28:16,869
I report what we found
to Monsignor Monaghan.

345
00:28:16,940 --> 00:28:19,238
He reports it to Cardinal Glennon's office.

346
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:22,767
In the end, the Cardinal himself will decide
what to tell them.

347
00:28:22,846 --> 00:28:24,837
What do you suppose that'll be?

348
00:28:25,048 --> 00:28:28,779
He'll probably just fix the steam pipe,
and let the commotion die down.

349
00:28:28,852 --> 00:28:32,253
But if you didn't tell them the truth,
you'd be committing a fraud.

350
00:28:32,322 --> 00:28:33,721
What is the truth?

351
00:28:34,358 --> 00:28:36,019
That the steam pipe leaks.

352
00:28:36,093 --> 00:28:37,822
That's only a fact, Benny.

353
00:28:38,195 --> 00:28:40,686
Like the sun being
the center of the solar system.

354
00:28:40,764 --> 00:28:43,426
Facts are only small parts
of a much larger truth.

355
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,467
Faith?

356
00:28:45,369 --> 00:28:46,336
Faith.

357
00:28:46,903 --> 00:28:49,428
People see blood flowing
from a statue's heart.

358
00:28:49,506 --> 00:28:51,474
They believe God caused it to happen.

359
00:28:51,541 --> 00:28:53,338
- But he didn't.
- But he did.

360
00:28:54,244 --> 00:28:56,508
God is the first cause of everything.

361
00:28:57,748 --> 00:28:59,375
He made that pipe leak.

362
00:29:01,184 --> 00:29:05,985
Judging from all the rust, he must've been
working on that stunt for quite a while.

363
00:29:06,356 --> 00:29:07,914
From all eternity.

364
00:29:21,305 --> 00:29:23,170
- Frank.
- Nice party.

365
00:29:23,974 --> 00:29:25,066
How're you doing?

366
00:29:25,142 --> 00:29:28,441
So far, I've met the Flynns,
the Foleys, the Flahertys...

367
00:29:28,512 --> 00:29:30,707
the Deegans, the Doogans...

368
00:29:30,781 --> 00:29:34,239
the O'Connors, O'Neals, McMahons,
and all the clan O'Toole.

369
00:29:34,318 --> 00:29:36,479
You make it sound like
one of Frank's songs.

370
00:29:36,553 --> 00:29:38,748
After the Irish,
the Germans will be a cinch.

371
00:29:38,822 --> 00:29:40,517
You'll take the war in your stride.

372
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:43,081
Except for one little problem
you can help me with.

373
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,422
Whose side is God on?

374
00:29:44,494 --> 00:29:46,792
Is he an Englishman,
Frenchman, German...

375
00:29:46,863 --> 00:29:48,228
or is he an American?

376
00:29:48,298 --> 00:29:50,858
He certainly could have his pick.
They all claim him.

377
00:29:50,934 --> 00:29:53,767
- Happy?
- I've never been happier in my life.

378
00:29:53,837 --> 00:29:55,964
How'd you like to meet the Rampbells?

379
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,167
I'd like to, very much.

380
00:30:00,077 --> 00:30:01,567
Mom, Dad...

381
00:30:02,012 --> 00:30:04,503
I'd like you to meet Mona's brother,
Father Steve.

382
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:07,846
- How do you do, Mr. and Mrs. Rampbell?
- Hello.

383
00:30:07,918 --> 00:30:12,378
I feel for you both. There's nothing quite
as lonely as being in a crowd of strangers.

384
00:30:12,456 --> 00:30:14,151
Not entirely strangers, Father.

385
00:30:14,224 --> 00:30:17,250
There are several men here
I've done business with for years...

386
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:18,487
including our host.

387
00:30:18,562 --> 00:30:21,326
Of course, I've never been invited
to their homes before.

388
00:30:21,398 --> 00:30:23,127
Or invited them to yours.

389
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,930
Or invited them to ours, it's quite true.

390
00:30:26,002 --> 00:30:28,903
All right, you micks,
let's have a little quiet here.

391
00:30:29,206 --> 00:30:30,833
I want to propose a toast...

392
00:30:30,907 --> 00:30:33,171
to Mona Fermoyle and her soldier boy.

393
00:30:33,243 --> 00:30:34,403
There they are.

394
00:30:34,478 --> 00:30:36,503
In case you haven't already met him...

395
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,048
the lad's name is Benny Rampbell.

396
00:30:39,349 --> 00:30:41,112
But don't let the name throw you.

397
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:43,015
I have it on reliable authority...

398
00:30:43,086 --> 00:30:45,782
that it's soon to become
a good Catholic name.

399
00:30:47,257 --> 00:30:50,624
As soon as that happens,
and I have this on good authority, too...

400
00:30:50,694 --> 00:30:54,027
that same good Catholic name
will become Mona's.

401
00:30:56,032 --> 00:30:57,329
So what do you say?

402
00:30:57,401 --> 00:30:59,665
Let's just tack an "O" in front of it...

403
00:30:59,736 --> 00:31:02,899
and make the whole clan of them
honorary Irishmen.

404
00:31:07,611 --> 00:31:09,238
Now we know the answer.

405
00:31:10,313 --> 00:31:11,780
God is an Irishman.

406
00:31:12,649 --> 00:31:13,638
Come on.

407
00:31:47,951 --> 00:31:49,942
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

408
00:31:50,020 --> 00:31:52,420
It's been one week since
my last confession.

409
00:31:52,489 --> 00:31:53,888
These are my sins.

410
00:31:55,659 --> 00:31:56,648
Yes?

411
00:31:58,028 --> 00:31:59,552
I slept with a man.

412
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:03,162
Are you engaged to this man?

413
00:32:04,534 --> 00:32:05,523
Yes.

414
00:32:07,537 --> 00:32:10,267
Couldn't you have waited
until you were married?

415
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:13,132
Steve, you didn't persuade him.

416
00:32:14,144 --> 00:32:16,510
Benny's not going to become a Catholic.

417
00:32:18,048 --> 00:32:19,208
I thought...

418
00:32:19,950 --> 00:32:21,577
if we made love...

419
00:32:22,819 --> 00:32:25,310
I thought I could make him
change his mind.

420
00:32:28,725 --> 00:32:30,488
Steve, I'm so miserable.

421
00:32:33,096 --> 00:32:34,654
Please help me.

422
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:40,568
Would he agree to let your children
be raised as Catholics?

423
00:32:40,637 --> 00:32:41,626
No.

424
00:32:42,939 --> 00:32:44,634
He says that isn't fair.

425
00:32:45,575 --> 00:32:49,170
He won't marry me at all,
unless I take him just the way he is.

426
00:32:51,948 --> 00:32:53,745
Then you cannot be married.

427
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,685
He says, "Let's leave all religion
out of it and...

428
00:32:57,954 --> 00:32:59,683
"get married by a judge."

429
00:32:59,823 --> 00:33:02,724
That wouldn't be a marriage.
You'd be living in mortal sin.

430
00:33:02,792 --> 00:33:04,350
What else can I do?

431
00:33:04,995 --> 00:33:06,929
Why do you think I came here?

432
00:33:07,063 --> 00:33:09,554
I want you to tell me what to do.

433
00:33:11,701 --> 00:33:14,135
Hard as it may be, you must give him up.

434
00:33:20,343 --> 00:33:22,106
Is that all you can say?

435
00:33:22,646 --> 00:33:25,479
You must stop
these illicit relations immediately.

436
00:33:25,949 --> 00:33:27,541
- Steve.
- Father.

437
00:33:28,051 --> 00:33:29,279
This is me.

438
00:33:29,352 --> 00:33:30,751
And I'm a priest.

439
00:33:31,054 --> 00:33:33,147
What you've done is immoral and cheap.

440
00:33:33,223 --> 00:33:34,588
It wasn't cheap.

441
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:36,323
I'm in love with him.

442
00:33:36,393 --> 00:33:37,655
Is that a sin?

443
00:33:38,361 --> 00:33:42,593
Unless it's subordinated to a higher love,
the love of God, yes.

444
00:33:43,266 --> 00:33:46,463
Steve, you told me to hang on.

445
00:33:47,704 --> 00:33:50,036
I'm just trying to hang on.

446
00:33:51,374 --> 00:33:52,363
Help me.

447
00:33:53,243 --> 00:33:54,540
Please help me.

448
00:33:56,913 --> 00:34:00,644
Benny'll be going overseas soon.
He may be gone for a long time.

449
00:34:01,618 --> 00:34:03,643
There's a saying in Italian:

450
00:34:08,558 --> 00:34:11,118
"Love makes time pass,
time makes love pass."

451
00:34:15,565 --> 00:34:20,298
For these and all other sins
that I have committed, I ask forgiveness.

452
00:34:21,538 --> 00:34:25,702
For your penance, say three rosaries.
Now make a good act of contrition.

453
00:34:28,678 --> 00:34:32,307
My God, I am heartily sorry
I have offended thee.

454
00:34:33,049 --> 00:34:35,074
And a firm resolution to sin no more.

455
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:36,516
I can't do that!

456
00:34:36,686 --> 00:34:37,710
You must.

457
00:34:38,388 --> 00:34:40,185
I shouldn't have come here.

458
00:34:53,903 --> 00:34:56,394
Cardinal Glennon will see you now, Father.

459
00:35:24,367 --> 00:35:26,392
Good afternoon, Father Fermoyle.

460
00:35:27,504 --> 00:35:28,766
Your Eminence.

461
00:35:30,607 --> 00:35:32,472
I take the ring off for Bach.

462
00:35:34,044 --> 00:35:37,480
Everyday I practice for an hour.
My staff encouraged me.

463
00:35:37,714 --> 00:35:41,013
It may be that they hate music
and enjoy hearing what I do to it.

464
00:35:41,084 --> 00:35:44,747
Or perhaps they've learned the more
I pound the piano the less I pound them.

465
00:35:44,821 --> 00:35:46,220
They're probably right.

466
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:49,690
I'd hardly call it pounding, Your Eminence.
You play very well.

467
00:35:49,759 --> 00:35:52,887
The Goldberg Variations
are a great challenge to the amateur.

468
00:35:52,962 --> 00:35:56,762
But wasn't Your Eminence playing
the Chromatic Fantasy?

469
00:35:57,867 --> 00:36:01,564
When you compliment me as a musician,
I must find out whether you know music.

470
00:36:01,638 --> 00:36:04,573
Not that I'm trying to trap you.
That's not my purpose.

471
00:36:04,641 --> 00:36:05,767
It isn't?

472
00:36:05,842 --> 00:36:09,073
No, it's because of my infernal weakness
for flattery.

473
00:36:10,213 --> 00:36:12,773
You see, Fermoyle, I'm incorrigibly vain...

474
00:36:12,849 --> 00:36:14,840
not about my personal charms...

475
00:36:16,286 --> 00:36:18,345
but about certain accomplishments...

476
00:36:18,421 --> 00:36:21,322
that have nothing to do
with my function as a priest.

477
00:36:21,391 --> 00:36:24,918
Because of this flaw in my nature,
I must always be on my guard.

478
00:36:25,161 --> 00:36:28,221
Not only for the sake of my soul,
but for yours.

479
00:36:29,165 --> 00:36:30,928
I've read your book.

480
00:36:32,335 --> 00:36:36,101
I'm no historian, but it seems
a comprehensive treatment of the subject.

481
00:36:36,172 --> 00:36:37,264
Thank you.

482
00:36:37,907 --> 00:36:39,397
Why did you send it to me?

483
00:36:39,476 --> 00:36:42,411
Because Bishop Quarenghi
liked it very much and he felt...

484
00:36:42,479 --> 00:36:45,471
- Quarenghi, of the Vatican.
- Yes.

485
00:36:45,749 --> 00:36:49,412
He felt the next step would be
to get your imprimatur to publish it.

486
00:36:49,519 --> 00:36:51,009
Quarenghi read your book?

487
00:36:51,087 --> 00:36:53,681
Yes. In fact, he helped me
with a great deal of it.

488
00:36:53,757 --> 00:36:56,988
You were close friends
with this Bishop Quarenghi?

489
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:00,223
He was my teacher.
I admire him very much.

490
00:37:00,296 --> 00:37:02,992
He's in the office
of the Secretary of State?

491
00:37:03,066 --> 00:37:05,296
Yes, he is assistant to Cardinal Giacobbi.

492
00:37:05,368 --> 00:37:08,963
Giacobbi, whose main passion in life
is to guard the Holy Father...

493
00:37:09,038 --> 00:37:11,666
from contaminating contacts
with non-ltalians.

494
00:37:13,343 --> 00:37:16,608
Cardinal Giacobbi would have good reason
to like your book.

495
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:19,107
I'm not sure I understand...

496
00:37:19,182 --> 00:37:21,707
It deals with a time
when the Western Hemisphere...

497
00:37:21,785 --> 00:37:24,049
had little or no ecclesiastical significance.

498
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,747
Tell me, why did you write it?

499
00:37:25,822 --> 00:37:27,517
- Why?
- Yes, why? For what reason?

500
00:37:27,590 --> 00:37:30,150
- What did you expect to gain?
- I didn't expect to gain...

501
00:37:30,226 --> 00:37:31,158
Fame?

502
00:37:31,294 --> 00:37:33,592
- No, it was just...
- Admiration in Rome?

503
00:37:33,663 --> 00:37:35,130
The subject interested me...

504
00:37:35,198 --> 00:37:38,065
A job in the Vatican,
with the Secretary of State...

505
00:37:38,134 --> 00:37:39,761
close to your Italian friends?

506
00:37:39,836 --> 00:37:42,134
It was a field
that had been neglected and...

507
00:37:42,205 --> 00:37:45,641
Come, now. Examine your motives.
You are an ambitious priest.

508
00:37:46,142 --> 00:37:48,076
I recognize all the symptoms.

509
00:37:48,411 --> 00:37:50,538
You feel you're too good for parish work.

510
00:37:50,613 --> 00:37:52,171
I have never said that.

511
00:37:52,248 --> 00:37:54,409
Don't you think you're wasted here?

512
00:37:54,751 --> 00:37:56,946
Your gifts for language...

513
00:37:58,087 --> 00:37:59,748
for scholarship, diplomacy...

514
00:37:59,823 --> 00:38:02,621
All these are wasted at St. John's.
Admit it.

515
00:38:02,692 --> 00:38:03,920
No, Your Eminence.

516
00:38:03,993 --> 00:38:06,621
- The truth.
- I will serve wherever I'm sent.

517
00:38:06,930 --> 00:38:10,161
Father Fermoyle,
do you think there's more in you...

518
00:38:10,233 --> 00:38:12,667
than being a mere parish priest?

519
00:38:12,769 --> 00:38:13,861
The truth.

520
00:38:14,904 --> 00:38:16,269
Of course I do.

521
00:38:17,473 --> 00:38:19,668
You wanted the truth, Your Eminence.

522
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:23,702
Ambition is a disease in any man.
In a priest, it can be fatal.

523
00:38:25,448 --> 00:38:27,780
But at your age, it may still be curable.

524
00:38:29,719 --> 00:38:32,017
We shall begin your treatment at once.

525
00:38:33,556 --> 00:38:35,683
Cold climate, simple diet.

526
00:38:38,061 --> 00:38:39,585
Stonebury. Perfect.

527
00:38:41,064 --> 00:38:43,589
Stonebury will be
your spiritual sanitarium.

528
00:38:45,201 --> 00:38:47,226
You are now curate at Stonebury.

529
00:38:47,737 --> 00:38:51,002
The parish church is called St. Peter's,
no irony intended.

530
00:38:52,375 --> 00:38:54,400
You will assist Father Halley.

531
00:38:55,511 --> 00:38:57,138
A truly remarkable man.

532
00:38:58,047 --> 00:39:00,515
As a pastor, he's a total failure, but...

533
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,618
as an individual, he is without vanity...

534
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:06,345
ambition.

535
00:39:08,157 --> 00:39:10,250
From him, you can learn humility.

536
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:14,458
Goodbye, Father Fermoyle.

537
00:39:38,888 --> 00:39:39,912
Steve!

538
00:39:42,325 --> 00:39:44,486
Where've you been?
Where's Dad and the rest?

539
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:47,051
I tried to get you
before you left St. John's.

540
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,961
- What's wrong?
- Have you seen Mona?

541
00:39:49,032 --> 00:39:50,693
- No.
- Any message from her?

542
00:39:50,767 --> 00:39:52,530
- No.
- She's gone.

543
00:39:52,602 --> 00:39:56,094
She didn't come home last night.
We don't know where she is.

544
00:39:56,172 --> 00:39:57,332
With Benny?

545
00:39:57,607 --> 00:40:00,269
No, his regiment went overseas yesterday.

546
00:40:01,144 --> 00:40:03,544
Let me know
the minute you hear anything.

547
00:40:03,646 --> 00:40:05,477
Send me a wire at Stonebury.

548
00:40:06,149 --> 00:40:09,084
Call me. Tell Mom and Dad not to worry.

549
00:40:51,761 --> 00:40:53,922
- Father Fermoyle?
- Yes.

550
00:40:54,163 --> 00:40:55,528
Bonjour, Father.

551
00:40:55,865 --> 00:40:57,230
Jump on.

552
00:40:58,968 --> 00:41:01,835
Father Halley sent me to pick you up.

553
00:41:02,271 --> 00:41:03,795
Me, Hercule Menton.

554
00:41:03,873 --> 00:41:06,034
I'm very glad to meet you, Hercule.

555
00:42:02,231 --> 00:42:03,562
Father Halley.

556
00:43:31,554 --> 00:43:32,919
Father Fermoyle.

557
00:43:34,257 --> 00:43:36,316
Sorry I couldn't meet you myself.

558
00:43:36,392 --> 00:43:38,758
I was glad to be met at all. Thank you.

559
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:44,131
- You make a good fire.
- I was going to make some tea.

560
00:43:44,901 --> 00:43:47,096
Good, I'll just take this off.

561
00:43:47,203 --> 00:43:50,661
- Here, let me help you off with that coat.
- Thank you.

562
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,865
I'm not used to company.

563
00:43:53,209 --> 00:43:55,507
You should ask them to send you a curate.

564
00:43:55,578 --> 00:43:58,604
I'm afraid I've had
too many favors from His Eminence.

565
00:43:59,515 --> 00:44:03,781
Besides, there's hardly enough
revenue here to support one priest...

566
00:44:03,886 --> 00:44:05,376
let alone two.

567
00:44:07,089 --> 00:44:09,785
Things will be looking up
now that you're here.

568
00:44:10,259 --> 00:44:14,696
And a remarkably good collection
this Sunday.

569
00:44:15,531 --> 00:44:17,999
Quite a haul for St. Peter's.

570
00:44:18,100 --> 00:44:20,466
$1.85.

571
00:44:21,204 --> 00:44:23,832
Tomorrow we'll buy some coffee
to celebrate...

572
00:44:23,973 --> 00:44:26,464
your arrival with festivities.

573
00:44:39,422 --> 00:44:40,912
What's the matter?

574
00:44:44,727 --> 00:44:45,716
Nothing.

575
00:44:46,162 --> 00:44:48,027
You should be in bed.

576
00:44:48,464 --> 00:44:50,227
This'll pass, it always does.

577
00:44:50,299 --> 00:44:52,460
- Father, you're sick.
- I'm not sick.

578
00:44:52,902 --> 00:44:53,891
Sit down.

579
00:44:55,171 --> 00:44:57,401
Let's have some bread and tea.
I'll be all right.

580
00:44:58,341 --> 00:45:01,401
- Have some fish.
- No, thank you, it's enough.

581
00:45:03,112 --> 00:45:05,979
I always eat my principal meal at midday.

582
00:45:06,082 --> 00:45:08,915
- Would you like the fish?
- No, thank you.

583
00:45:10,453 --> 00:45:13,684
In the morning,
I'll show you around the parish.

584
00:45:14,223 --> 00:45:16,919
Why don't you rest tomorrow?
I can manage alone.

585
00:45:19,362 --> 00:45:21,023
Bless us...

586
00:45:22,565 --> 00:45:26,524
and these, thy gifts, which we are
about to receive from thy bounty...

587
00:45:27,937 --> 00:45:29,734
through Christ, our Lord...

588
00:45:32,241 --> 00:45:33,230
Amen.

589
00:45:34,844 --> 00:45:38,871
Father, I insist you eat that fish.

590
00:45:40,216 --> 00:45:42,616
You must be hungry after your long trip.

591
00:46:26,128 --> 00:46:27,459
Father Fermoyle.

592
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:32,031
- Good morning, Hercule.
- Good morning, Father.

593
00:46:32,101 --> 00:46:34,092
- How are you?
- Come in, come in.

594
00:46:41,344 --> 00:46:42,572
My daughter, Lalage.

595
00:46:42,645 --> 00:46:44,510
- Hello, Father.
- Hello, Lalage.

596
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:46,605
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

597
00:46:46,716 --> 00:46:49,412
- How is Father Halley?
- Not too well, I'm afraid.

598
00:46:49,485 --> 00:46:51,976
I'm glad they sent someone to help him.

599
00:46:52,455 --> 00:46:55,185
And this is my wife, Adele.

600
00:46:55,758 --> 00:46:58,056
Will you stay and eat with us, Father?

601
00:46:58,427 --> 00:47:00,258
Don't worry, there's plenty.

602
00:47:00,429 --> 00:47:03,296
No, thank you.
I'd better be getting back to Father Halley.

603
00:47:03,366 --> 00:47:04,355
Wait...

604
00:47:05,601 --> 00:47:07,592
Father Halley needs a hot meal.

605
00:47:15,745 --> 00:47:17,645
This'll make you feel better.

606
00:47:31,594 --> 00:47:33,858
How long have you had these spells?

607
00:47:35,831 --> 00:47:37,230
A long time?

608
00:47:37,700 --> 00:47:39,429
What does the doctor say?

609
00:47:39,502 --> 00:47:40,992
Well, he...

610
00:47:41,971 --> 00:47:44,906
- You've seen a doctor, haven't you?
- Yes, no.

611
00:47:45,708 --> 00:47:47,539
He couldn't diagnose it.

612
00:47:48,844 --> 00:47:53,110
He said I'd have to go to the hospital
for a week for a series of tests.

613
00:47:53,182 --> 00:47:54,171
And?

614
00:47:54,417 --> 00:47:55,714
We can't afford it.

615
00:47:55,785 --> 00:47:57,514
The diocesan can afford it.

616
00:47:57,887 --> 00:48:00,014
No, you mustn't ask him.

617
00:48:00,289 --> 00:48:01,654
But you're sick.

618
00:48:02,091 --> 00:48:05,117
His Eminence mustn't know.
He mustn't know that I'm sick.

619
00:48:05,194 --> 00:48:07,594
Cardinal Glennon? Why not?

620
00:48:07,863 --> 00:48:09,228
Well, you see...

621
00:48:10,599 --> 00:48:12,726
he gave me my first parish...

622
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:15,962
St. Anselm's in Stowe.

623
00:48:17,273 --> 00:48:20,606
It was a small church with a big mortgage.

624
00:48:23,546 --> 00:48:25,537
I couldn't lift it.

625
00:48:26,682 --> 00:48:28,445
He sent me to Needham.

626
00:48:29,018 --> 00:48:31,748
It was a prosperous parish.

627
00:48:33,022 --> 00:48:34,853
There was money in the bank.

628
00:48:36,091 --> 00:48:38,025
And I ran Needham into debt.

629
00:48:39,462 --> 00:48:41,521
His Eminence warned me.

630
00:48:42,865 --> 00:48:45,060
Then he sent me to...

631
00:48:45,134 --> 00:48:48,228
Malden, lpsfield...

632
00:48:48,838 --> 00:48:52,137
always some place lower in his favor.

633
00:48:53,909 --> 00:48:55,934
There's no more favor left, now.

634
00:49:00,015 --> 00:49:02,381
He's disappointed in me.

635
00:49:03,752 --> 00:49:05,379
He mustn't know...

636
00:49:06,722 --> 00:49:08,690
that I've failed again.

637
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:14,456
Father Fermoyle,
your brother phoned the store...

638
00:49:14,530 --> 00:49:16,498
to come to Boston as quickly as you can.

639
00:51:09,745 --> 00:51:10,734
Mona.

640
00:51:13,649 --> 00:51:15,276
What do you guys want?

641
00:51:16,085 --> 00:51:17,985
We want to talk to our sister.

642
00:51:18,053 --> 00:51:20,851
It sure don't look like
she wants to talk to you.

643
00:51:21,023 --> 00:51:22,251
Mona, please.

644
00:51:22,825 --> 00:51:24,292
What do you want?

645
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:26,689
We want you to come home.

646
00:51:26,929 --> 00:51:27,918
Why?

647
00:51:28,764 --> 00:51:30,959
You're breaking their hearts, Mona.

648
00:51:33,736 --> 00:51:35,328
Please come home.

649
00:51:37,172 --> 00:51:39,902
All right, I'll come home.

650
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:44,876
You don't think Mom will mind
if I bring Ramón home with me, do you?

651
00:51:45,514 --> 00:51:49,473
He spends a lot of his time in jail
and he hasn't really learned to read yet.

652
00:51:49,551 --> 00:51:52,782
You can tell her he's a Catholic.

653
00:51:52,855 --> 00:51:54,345
Mona, listen to me.

654
00:51:54,757 --> 00:51:57,055
- Benny won't be gone...
- Shut up.

655
00:52:05,134 --> 00:52:06,863
We'll start all over again.

656
00:52:06,935 --> 00:52:09,927
We'll try to work out a way
that you and Benny can be married.

657
00:52:10,005 --> 00:52:11,836
I promise I'll do everything I can.

658
00:52:11,907 --> 00:52:15,172
Why don't you leave me alone!
What do you want from me?

659
00:52:16,512 --> 00:52:18,343
I just want you to be happy.

660
00:52:18,414 --> 00:52:19,574
Is that all?

661
00:52:19,982 --> 00:52:21,973
Don't you want to forgive me, too?

662
00:52:22,051 --> 00:52:24,986
Isn't that what you priests
usually like to do the most?

663
00:52:25,054 --> 00:52:27,887
- He's not your enemy, Mona.
- God will forgive you.

664
00:52:28,424 --> 00:52:30,358
Will you hear my confession, Father?

665
00:52:30,426 --> 00:52:33,224
I'll be glad to hear your confession
at the proper time...

666
00:52:33,295 --> 00:52:35,229
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

667
00:52:35,297 --> 00:52:38,289
- Don't do this.
- I'll do anything I damn well please!

668
00:52:40,102 --> 00:52:41,433
I've had it.

669
00:52:42,538 --> 00:52:46,474
I'm through. I'm through with you
and I'm through with your...

670
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:50,775
pious, mealy-mouthed,
hypocritical religion.

671
00:52:52,114 --> 00:52:54,241
And I'm through with your God, too.

672
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:58,208
The next time you talk to him,
you tell him that for me.

673
00:53:00,089 --> 00:53:02,023
Come on, lover, let's dance.

674
00:53:13,602 --> 00:53:15,092
It's not your fault.

675
00:53:15,671 --> 00:53:16,933
Yes, it is.

676
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:50,062
- Lalage.
- Hello, Father.

677
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:51,902
Did you do all this?

678
00:53:52,141 --> 00:53:55,668
You said look after Father Halley
while you were gone. So I did.

679
00:53:55,811 --> 00:53:57,938
- The doctor's with him now.
- What doctor?

680
00:53:58,013 --> 00:54:00,982
Dr. Carter.
I got him to come up from Lynchburgh.

681
00:54:01,283 --> 00:54:03,274
I work in his office sometimes.

682
00:54:04,086 --> 00:54:06,418
Now that you're back,
I better be going home.

683
00:54:06,488 --> 00:54:08,547
It was very kind of you to do so much.

684
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:10,888
It's very little compared to what he's done.

685
00:54:10,959 --> 00:54:12,221
Father Halley?

686
00:54:13,295 --> 00:54:15,627
When I was a child, Grand-mere died.

687
00:54:15,898 --> 00:54:18,298
She was very old, very frightened...

688
00:54:18,634 --> 00:54:19,965
very religious.

689
00:54:20,636 --> 00:54:24,732
Father Halley was sick himself,
but he stayed with her night and day...

690
00:54:25,274 --> 00:54:28,107
prayed with her, helped her die well.

691
00:54:29,745 --> 00:54:31,542
I'll be back to fix supper.

692
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,680
Doctor?

693
00:54:40,622 --> 00:54:41,987
Father Fermoyle?

694
00:54:42,057 --> 00:54:44,389
I'm afraid your pastor's a very sick man.

695
00:54:44,459 --> 00:54:45,517
What is it?

696
00:54:45,594 --> 00:54:49,690
The name of the disease? I can tell you,
but very little else about it.

697
00:54:50,132 --> 00:54:52,498
It's called multiple sclerosis.

698
00:54:52,835 --> 00:54:55,702
We don't know its cause,
and there's no cure for it.

699
00:54:55,771 --> 00:54:58,399
It's a breakdown
of the entire nervous system.

700
00:54:58,574 --> 00:55:00,701
It can develop quickly or slowly.

701
00:55:01,243 --> 00:55:03,234
But always in the same direction.

702
00:55:03,312 --> 00:55:05,405
How far has it gone with Father Halley?

703
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:06,708
Near the end.

704
00:55:06,849 --> 00:55:09,249
Has he always had this lack of energy?

705
00:55:09,918 --> 00:55:12,409
I think so. I'm not sure how long.

706
00:55:13,288 --> 00:55:16,416
Chances are he's been slowly dying
all his adult life.

707
00:55:17,259 --> 00:55:19,784
It's amazing he was able to function at all.

708
00:55:19,928 --> 00:55:23,022
- What can we do for him now?
- He'll need full-time care.

709
00:55:23,098 --> 00:55:25,623
He ought to be in a hospital
or a nursing home.

710
00:55:26,301 --> 00:55:30,829
If he's going to die, he'll die as a pastor
in his own bed, in his own parish.

711
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:34,634
That's liable to be harder on you
than it is on him.

712
00:55:35,110 --> 00:55:36,202
Thank you.

713
00:55:36,345 --> 00:55:38,745
You give him this as directed.

714
00:55:40,749 --> 00:55:44,310
- Is this medicine very expensive?
- Yes.

715
00:55:44,553 --> 00:55:47,579
The longer he lasts, the more it will cost.

716
00:56:29,831 --> 00:56:32,391
It's never agreeable to watch someone go.

717
00:56:33,769 --> 00:56:36,465
Forgive me for the long time I take.

718
00:57:26,621 --> 00:57:28,555
Doesn't any of this bother you?

719
00:57:28,623 --> 00:57:30,750
No, it's only nature.

720
00:57:31,093 --> 00:57:32,082
It's strange.

721
00:57:32,361 --> 00:57:33,521
What is strange?

722
00:57:33,595 --> 00:57:36,428
For a girl who's young, attractive...

723
00:57:36,498 --> 00:57:39,331
to spend her days, her nights like this.

724
00:57:40,202 --> 00:57:41,692
But you are a priest.

725
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:44,671
You must understand
what it is to want to be of use.

726
00:57:44,906 --> 00:57:47,374
You see, I have my vocation, too.

727
00:57:47,676 --> 00:57:50,008
I have been accepted by the Geraldines.

728
00:57:50,078 --> 00:57:51,375
The Geraldines?

729
00:57:51,546 --> 00:57:53,104
The nursing sisterhood.

730
00:57:53,181 --> 00:57:56,344
Yes, I know.
They take care of the incurable.

731
00:57:56,418 --> 00:57:58,249
The incurable and the dying.

732
00:57:59,021 --> 00:58:00,921
And that's the life you want?

733
00:58:01,823 --> 00:58:04,417
That is the life I was born for.

734
00:58:09,064 --> 00:58:11,191
Did you ever see this ring before?

735
00:58:11,466 --> 00:58:13,331
Yes, it used to be mine.

736
00:58:13,502 --> 00:58:14,730
Where did you get it?

737
00:58:14,803 --> 00:58:16,703
- It was given to me.
- By whom?

738
00:58:16,838 --> 00:58:17,998
By a friend.

739
00:58:18,407 --> 00:58:20,068
Where did you get the ring?

740
00:58:20,142 --> 00:58:24,203
Your fence, I believe, as you say
in the underworld, was pinched.

741
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,848
One of the items recovered was this ring.

742
00:58:27,949 --> 00:58:30,816
The police thought
it might have been stolen from a bishop.

743
00:58:30,886 --> 00:58:34,253
But the Karaghousian twins...

744
00:58:34,489 --> 00:58:37,219
claimed they bought it
from one Father Fermoyle.

745
00:58:38,226 --> 00:58:40,922
We've never had a priest
working with the Mafia before.

746
00:58:40,996 --> 00:58:44,625
But I suppose during your stay in Rome,
you made many interesting contacts.

747
00:58:44,699 --> 00:58:46,360
I had no choice, Your Eminence.

748
00:58:46,435 --> 00:58:48,460
I had to work my way
through the seminary...

749
00:58:48,537 --> 00:58:50,732
selling opium in St. Peter's Square.

750
00:58:54,109 --> 00:58:56,441
- You're not afraid of me, are you?
- No.

751
00:58:57,612 --> 00:58:59,705
Why not? Most people are.

752
00:59:00,215 --> 00:59:02,843
Maybe it's because
you remind me of my father.

753
00:59:02,951 --> 00:59:05,317
He's sometimes called
Din the Downshouter.

754
00:59:05,387 --> 00:59:08,083
But his roar
is the only fierce thing about him.

755
00:59:09,424 --> 00:59:11,790
He's a lucky man to have a son...

756
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:14,554
who's not afraid of him.

757
00:59:14,896 --> 00:59:16,625
But about this ring...

758
00:59:17,632 --> 00:59:19,099
why did you sell it?

759
00:59:19,367 --> 00:59:21,130
- I needed the money.
- What for?

760
00:59:21,203 --> 00:59:23,171
For private reasons, Your Eminence.

761
00:59:23,238 --> 00:59:26,799
There are no private reasons
between a priest and his archbishop.

762
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:31,935
I needed the money to pay
for Father Halley's medical expenses.

763
00:59:32,681 --> 00:59:35,206
- Is he ill?
- He's dying, Your Eminence.

764
00:59:35,817 --> 00:59:38,911
- Why wasn't I told?
- He didn't want you to know.

765
00:59:47,162 --> 00:59:49,756
Father O'Brien,
have the car brought around.

766
01:00:14,856 --> 01:00:15,845
Ned?

767
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:20,022
Your Eminence.

768
01:00:22,330 --> 01:00:24,764
- Larry.
- How are you, Larry?

769
01:00:26,668 --> 01:00:29,228
Giving everybody a bad time, as usual.

770
01:00:29,738 --> 01:00:31,103
You know me, Ned.

771
01:00:31,339 --> 01:00:32,897
I've let you down again.

772
01:00:32,974 --> 01:00:35,238
No, it's I who've let you down.

773
01:00:35,877 --> 01:00:39,335
Who else would have put up so long
with an old muddler like me?

774
01:00:39,414 --> 01:00:40,938
You're no such thing.

775
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:42,978
Now, Larry...

776
01:00:43,652 --> 01:00:46,120
no more of that silver tongue of yours...

777
01:00:46,555 --> 01:00:49,183
that we always said
would talk you to the top.

778
01:00:50,192 --> 01:00:52,592
The top of a mountain of worldly vanity.

779
01:00:53,962 --> 01:00:56,863
I do want to thank you
for giving me this parish.

780
01:00:57,766 --> 01:00:59,859
The poorest in the diocese.

781
01:01:00,168 --> 01:01:01,760
It was rich to me.

782
01:01:03,438 --> 01:01:06,032
And then you sent me Father Fermoyle.

783
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:09,575
Vain, ambitious Roman puppy.

784
01:01:10,312 --> 01:01:12,371
He's rather like you were, Larry.

785
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:14,405
That's a mortal blow.

786
01:01:15,717 --> 01:01:17,378
I mean in his goodness.

787
01:01:18,620 --> 01:01:20,884
Would you let him take my place here?

788
01:01:21,823 --> 01:01:24,314
He'll make a good pastor, I know.

789
01:01:25,660 --> 01:01:27,423
People love him already.

790
01:01:30,665 --> 01:01:32,963
Grand idea. Thank you, Ned.

791
01:01:38,807 --> 01:01:41,071
Would you do me one last favor?

792
01:01:41,876 --> 01:01:42,865
Anything.

793
01:01:44,646 --> 01:01:48,480
Would you give me extreme unction?

794
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:52,579
I'd consider it a great honor, Ned.

795
01:02:22,784 --> 01:02:24,979
It'll be over soon. I hope.

796
01:02:26,855 --> 01:02:29,722
You'll have the job
of shutting down the church.

797
01:02:30,158 --> 01:02:32,422
Send all the records to the dean at Averill.

798
01:02:32,494 --> 01:02:33,756
But, Your Eminence...

799
01:02:33,828 --> 01:02:36,490
I've kept the church open only for his sake.

800
01:02:37,065 --> 01:02:40,660
- But you told him you were going to...
- I thanked him for his idea.

801
01:02:41,503 --> 01:02:43,437
I happen to have another one for you.

802
01:02:43,505 --> 01:02:45,268
But these people need a church.

803
01:02:45,340 --> 01:02:48,935
A priest will come Sundays for Mass.
All else will be done through Averill.

804
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:50,739
Once a week isn't enough.

805
01:02:50,845 --> 01:02:53,211
You must learn
that when I've made up my mind...

806
01:02:53,281 --> 01:02:57,012
I don't like interminable discussion,
otherwise you'll be no use to me...

807
01:02:57,085 --> 01:02:58,552
as my secretary.

808
01:03:16,304 --> 01:03:18,966
- Are you sure it's the same guy?
- Absolutely.

809
01:03:30,218 --> 01:03:32,482
And now, we proudly present...

810
01:03:32,854 --> 01:03:35,823
Bobby and his Adora-Belles.

811
01:06:18,620 --> 01:06:21,851
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I take great pleasure in presenting...

812
01:06:21,923 --> 01:06:24,050
that suave Tiger of the Tango:

813
01:06:24,125 --> 01:06:26,685
Ramón Gongaro and his partner.

814
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:44,177
That isn't Mona.

815
01:06:55,456 --> 01:06:56,445
Let's go.

816
01:07:12,807 --> 01:07:14,832
- Where's Mona?
- I don't know.

817
01:07:14,909 --> 01:07:16,069
Where is she?

818
01:07:16,144 --> 01:07:19,807
- I haven't seen her for five months.
- Where did you see her last?

819
01:07:19,881 --> 01:07:23,476
- In Albany. She left the act there.
- You mean you left her there.

820
01:07:23,551 --> 01:07:26,384
- No, I told her...
- Told her what?

821
01:07:26,454 --> 01:07:27,682
I told her I'd pay.

822
01:07:27,755 --> 01:07:30,952
- Pay for what?
- For an abortion. But she didn't want...

823
01:07:33,695 --> 01:07:36,289
Great, our only lead
and you have to knock him cold.

824
01:07:36,364 --> 01:07:37,956
What's going on there?

825
01:07:40,768 --> 01:07:44,329
It's our friend, Officer.
He's a bit under the weather, I'm afraid.

826
01:07:44,405 --> 01:07:46,270
What with the chilly night...

827
01:07:46,341 --> 01:07:48,400
and the need for a nip to keep one warm.

828
01:07:48,476 --> 01:07:52,810
- Could I be getting your friend a cab?
- That would be most kind of you, Officer.

829
01:07:53,948 --> 01:07:56,883
- Where is she?
- 5 Stanhope Lane, I think.

830
01:07:59,854 --> 01:08:04,257
A noble and lonely task it is, preserving
the law and order on a night like this.

831
01:08:04,359 --> 01:08:05,826
Thank you, Officer.

832
01:08:27,148 --> 01:08:28,240
I'm Ramón.

833
01:08:35,723 --> 01:08:37,850
- What do you want?
- Where's Mona?

834
01:08:37,925 --> 01:08:39,722
Second floor, in the back.

835
01:08:39,894 --> 01:08:41,725
Who are your friends?

836
01:08:41,996 --> 01:08:43,691
Second floor, in the back.

837
01:09:07,021 --> 01:09:09,216
Mona, it's me.

838
01:09:10,992 --> 01:09:13,290
Put your arms around me, just hang on.

839
01:09:23,604 --> 01:09:24,832
I'm Dr. Parks.

840
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:27,674
- Are you the husband?
- No.

841
01:09:28,076 --> 01:09:29,543
She has no husband.

842
01:09:29,711 --> 01:09:30,973
She's our sister.

843
01:09:31,045 --> 01:09:33,673
Your sister's been in labor
for several days.

844
01:09:33,781 --> 01:09:35,772
She's lost a great deal of blood.

845
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:38,341
Why has she received
no medical attention?

846
01:09:38,519 --> 01:09:40,783
Because we didn't know where she was.

847
01:09:40,888 --> 01:09:43,356
Her pelvic structure is abnormally small.

848
01:09:43,424 --> 01:09:47,326
The child's head is unusually large.
Normal delivery is impossible.

849
01:09:47,395 --> 01:09:49,454
You can perform a cesarean, can't you?

850
01:09:49,530 --> 01:09:52,499
It's much too late for that.
But we can save her.

851
01:09:53,034 --> 01:09:56,595
I'll need your permission
as next of kin to do a fetal craniotomy.

852
01:09:57,071 --> 01:09:58,902
- A craniotomy?
- Yes.

853
01:09:59,540 --> 01:10:01,633
We have to crush the child's head.

854
01:10:03,077 --> 01:10:05,204
You want to kill the child?

855
01:10:07,248 --> 01:10:09,341
You can't let Mona die.

856
01:10:09,817 --> 01:10:12,615
I take it this is
some sort of religious scruple?

857
01:10:13,554 --> 01:10:16,751
It's a Commandment. "Thou shalt not kill."

858
01:10:17,592 --> 01:10:19,856
But it's all right to kill Mona?

859
01:10:20,027 --> 01:10:22,052
If Mona dies because we won't...

860
01:10:22,530 --> 01:10:25,863
commit a murder to save her,
she dies a natural death.

861
01:10:26,968 --> 01:10:28,333
But the baby...

862
01:10:28,936 --> 01:10:31,268
We'd be taking a creature of God's...

863
01:10:31,339 --> 01:10:33,466
alive, with a soul.

864
01:10:34,242 --> 01:10:35,834
And deliberately kill it.

865
01:10:35,910 --> 01:10:37,673
I won't permit you to kill Mona.

866
01:10:37,745 --> 01:10:40,873
Excuse me, there's not much time.
Are you a member of this family?

867
01:10:40,948 --> 01:10:41,972
No.

868
01:10:42,049 --> 01:10:44,609
Then which of you has the final say here?

869
01:10:44,685 --> 01:10:45,674
He does.

870
01:10:51,826 --> 01:10:54,795
I can't give you my permission
to commit murder.

871
01:10:56,831 --> 01:10:57,889
Can I see her?

872
01:10:57,965 --> 01:11:01,662
You have to be quick about it,
unless you want to lose both of them.

873
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:10,335
Monie, can you hear me?

874
01:11:12,914 --> 01:11:13,903
Hear.

875
01:11:16,984 --> 01:11:18,451
Say after me...

876
01:11:18,853 --> 01:11:23,051
O, my God, I am heartily sorry
for having offended thee.

877
01:11:28,162 --> 01:11:29,151
O...

878
01:11:35,736 --> 01:11:36,725
thee.

879
01:11:38,906 --> 01:11:40,840
O, my God.

880
01:11:43,811 --> 01:11:44,800
God...

881
01:11:46,981 --> 01:11:48,278
O, my God...

882
01:11:48,349 --> 01:11:50,817
All right, Father, you'll have to go now.

883
01:12:03,264 --> 01:12:04,253
Steve!

884
01:13:14,568 --> 01:13:17,901
Happy birthday to you

885
01:13:18,706 --> 01:13:23,700
Happy birthday, dear Regina

886
01:13:24,478 --> 01:13:27,276
Happy birthday

887
01:13:27,348 --> 01:13:29,748
to you

888
01:13:31,018 --> 01:13:34,146
- Happy birthday. What a big girl!
- Blow out the candles.

889
01:13:35,990 --> 01:13:37,287
Give it a try.

890
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,258
Blow out the other one. Blow it out.

891
01:13:41,896 --> 01:13:43,227
Two, one more.

892
01:13:50,471 --> 01:13:51,768
Get in.

893
01:14:01,415 --> 01:14:05,249
Father Callahan packed a bag for you.
Whatever he forgot, you can buy in Rome.

894
01:14:05,319 --> 01:14:06,308
Rome?

895
01:14:06,387 --> 01:14:08,412
Yes, the Pope died this morning.

896
01:14:33,914 --> 01:14:36,508
What does the Captain say?

897
01:14:36,751 --> 01:14:40,209
We've lost three days.
If it clears tomorrow, we can make up one.

898
01:14:40,287 --> 01:14:42,414
He'll have to do better than that.

899
01:14:42,957 --> 01:14:45,482
The only thing that's keeping me alive...

900
01:14:45,559 --> 01:14:46,753
is the thought of...

901
01:14:46,827 --> 01:14:49,455
being there in time to vote for a new pope.

902
01:14:50,197 --> 01:14:52,688
To go through
what I'm going through now...

903
01:14:52,767 --> 01:14:54,962
would be...

904
01:15:17,758 --> 01:15:21,091
- Where's my trunk?
- They promised to send it right over.

905
01:15:21,362 --> 01:15:23,489
- What's happening?
- Nothing.

906
01:15:39,847 --> 01:15:42,645
There should be smoke soon,
white or dark.

907
01:15:42,917 --> 01:15:45,147
This ballot is taking a long time.

908
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:49,214
Maybe it'll be dark.
Maybe there's still no majority.

909
01:15:49,523 --> 01:15:51,218
Would you prefer that?

910
01:15:51,292 --> 01:15:54,227
What difference does one more ballot
make if it's a deadlock?

911
01:15:54,295 --> 01:15:56,991
The American Church
has a right to participate.

912
01:16:04,238 --> 01:16:06,900
It's white!

913
01:16:47,114 --> 01:16:49,105
Yes, Your Eminence, right away.

914
01:16:52,119 --> 01:16:53,518
It's all wound up.

915
01:16:55,956 --> 01:16:58,948
Stephen, good of you to come down.
Sit yourself.

916
01:16:59,860 --> 01:17:03,227
And how have you been occupied,
this splendid Roman day?

917
01:17:03,297 --> 01:17:05,891
Your private audience
must have gone very well.

918
01:17:05,966 --> 01:17:07,558
What's he like, the new pope?

919
01:17:07,635 --> 01:17:10,069
Amazing, the way he takes it
all in his stride.

920
01:17:10,137 --> 01:17:12,697
The man was made cardinal
only eight months ago.

921
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:16,466
I brought up a point of procedure
for the next conclave.

922
01:17:16,544 --> 01:17:18,774
A procedure for what happens
when he dies?

923
01:17:18,846 --> 01:17:22,873
- That must have been a bit delicate.
- He seemed quite detached about it.

924
01:17:22,950 --> 01:17:25,942
I explained that no matter
how much faster ships they build...

925
01:17:26,020 --> 01:17:29,581
ten days is still too short a time
to get from the United States to Rome.

926
01:17:29,657 --> 01:17:31,284
He agreed to make it 15 days.

927
01:17:31,358 --> 01:17:33,758
Congratulations.
That's quite an accomplishment.

928
01:17:33,827 --> 01:17:35,658
Not my only one today.

929
01:17:36,897 --> 01:17:38,728
Before I forget, your...

930
01:17:39,233 --> 01:17:40,495
bishop's ring.

931
01:17:41,735 --> 01:17:44,101
You'll be needing it one of these days.

932
01:17:45,339 --> 01:17:49,002
The Holy Father, it seems,
is genuinely interested in America.

933
01:17:49,176 --> 01:17:51,906
I called his attention
to the almost complete absence...

934
01:17:51,979 --> 01:17:55,244
of our countrymen
from the ranks of the Secretariat of State.

935
01:17:55,316 --> 01:17:58,012
From there it was
only a step to persuading him...

936
01:17:58,085 --> 01:18:02,317
it'd be difficult for the Vatican to function
in the future without your services.

937
01:18:02,623 --> 01:18:06,650
You'll be a domestic prelate,
Monsignor Fermoyle.

938
01:18:07,428 --> 01:18:10,397
Entitled to wear the violet cassock
and manteletta.

939
01:18:13,234 --> 01:18:14,462
Well, Stephen?

940
01:18:16,770 --> 01:18:18,135
What's the matter?

941
01:18:21,075 --> 01:18:23,202
It isn't an easy thing to explain.

942
01:18:23,844 --> 01:18:24,970
What isn't?

943
01:18:25,946 --> 01:18:27,208
Speak up, man.

944
01:18:27,481 --> 01:18:29,745
I can't accept a post at the Vatican.

945
01:18:29,984 --> 01:18:31,110
Can't accept?

946
01:18:31,552 --> 01:18:34,680
- It's not a matter of choice.
- In this case, it is.

947
01:18:35,789 --> 01:18:37,780
I have to leave the priesthood.

948
01:18:37,891 --> 01:18:39,882
But that's impossible.

949
01:18:40,394 --> 01:18:43,659
- You can't suddenly...
- It isn't sudden.

950
01:18:43,731 --> 01:18:46,063
I've been working up to this for years.

951
01:18:46,133 --> 01:18:48,192
I'm only telling you now because...

952
01:18:48,269 --> 01:18:50,169
What a masterpiece of timing!

953
01:18:50,504 --> 01:18:54,600
An hour ago, at the Pope's request I was
listing your virtues to Cardinal Giacobbi.

954
01:18:54,675 --> 01:18:57,872
What a story he'll make of this,
with his anti-American prejudice.

955
01:18:57,945 --> 01:19:00,140
You set the whole hemisphere
back a decade.

956
01:19:00,214 --> 01:19:04,878
I'm deeply sorry for any embarrassment
this may cause you, but I hardly think...

957
01:19:04,952 --> 01:19:07,443
I don't want to hear what you think.
Now or ever.

958
01:19:07,521 --> 01:19:09,079
Go, do you hear me? Go!

959
01:19:09,189 --> 01:19:11,885
Our conversation is over.
You're dismissed! Go.

960
01:19:19,667 --> 01:19:20,656
Yes?

961
01:19:24,305 --> 01:19:25,567
Your Eminence.

962
01:19:27,141 --> 01:19:30,577
You didn't even explain to me
why you want to leave the priesthood.

963
01:19:30,644 --> 01:19:33,613
I should have.
I didn't get the right opportunity.

964
01:19:33,981 --> 01:19:36,279
It's been in your mind for so long.
May I sit?

965
01:19:36,350 --> 01:19:39,581
- Please do, Your Eminence.
- Why didn't you tell me before?

966
01:19:40,087 --> 01:19:41,315
I don't know.

967
01:19:41,789 --> 01:19:44,622
I wasn't clear enough
about what I really thought.

968
01:19:45,225 --> 01:19:49,161
I must know what's behind
this extraordinary decision of yours.

969
01:19:49,630 --> 01:19:53,088
I'm not sure I could separate
one reason from the others and say:

970
01:19:53,167 --> 01:19:54,794
"That's what did it."

971
01:19:57,705 --> 01:20:00,868
I don't think I was meant to be a priest
to begin with.

972
01:20:01,408 --> 01:20:03,137
It wasn't my idea.

973
01:20:04,545 --> 01:20:06,843
My parents decided it when I was a baby.

974
01:20:07,715 --> 01:20:10,684
I can't remember a time
when it wasn't an established thing.

975
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:13,345
Like Dad being the one to go out
and earn a living...

976
01:20:13,420 --> 01:20:17,220
Mom staying home to care for the house
and kids. Nobody ever questioned it.

977
01:20:17,291 --> 01:20:18,883
I never questioned it.

978
01:20:19,093 --> 01:20:21,823
A dollar a week was put aside
for my education.

979
01:20:21,895 --> 01:20:24,295
A dollar a week out of a motorman's pay.

980
01:20:25,666 --> 01:20:29,762
By the time I was in seventh grade
my brother was calling me "the Cardinal."

981
01:20:30,237 --> 01:20:33,502
This morning I'd have said
he had the makings of a prophet.

982
01:20:34,274 --> 01:20:38,472
The only doubt I had, I wasn't sure
I had the strength to be a good priest...

983
01:20:39,413 --> 01:20:42,109
to deny myself what had to be denied...

984
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:45,650
to live without the softness of a woman.

985
01:20:46,887 --> 01:20:49,321
On the other side,
there was the scholastic part.

986
01:20:49,390 --> 01:20:51,585
I liked my courses, I was good at them.

987
01:20:51,658 --> 01:20:54,525
As long as it was all theory
and no practice...

988
01:20:55,129 --> 01:20:57,029
I felt I was where I belonged.

989
01:20:59,500 --> 01:21:02,196
But then came the time
when I was on my own...

990
01:21:03,003 --> 01:21:05,995
when I had to function
as God's anointed...

991
01:21:07,141 --> 01:21:10,838
answering people's questions about
what was right, what was wrong...

992
01:21:11,011 --> 01:21:12,979
making decisions for them.

993
01:21:15,349 --> 01:21:18,944
And one day,
it was my own sister who needed my help.

994
01:21:21,054 --> 01:21:23,079
And I found I couldn't help her.

995
01:21:23,791 --> 01:21:27,227
Because what she needed was a man,
a friend, a brother.

996
01:21:27,861 --> 01:21:30,830
And all I could be was a judge
with a set of rules.

997
01:21:33,434 --> 01:21:37,700
And finally the time came when
my being a priest meant she had to die.

998
01:21:40,007 --> 01:21:42,202
I did what I had to do, I know that.

999
01:21:42,509 --> 01:21:46,707
What I had to do as a priest,
as an agent of God's law...

1000
01:21:48,315 --> 01:21:51,546
I couldn't do what a layman would do
in the same situation:

1001
01:21:51,618 --> 01:21:54,086
Pretend that he'd never heard of the law.

1002
01:21:54,655 --> 01:21:56,782
I don't challenge the rules.

1003
01:21:57,558 --> 01:22:00,584
I just don't want to be the one
to enforce them.

1004
01:22:00,761 --> 01:22:02,490
Not for anybody's sister.

1005
01:22:03,797 --> 01:22:06,732
I don't want the power
over other people's lives.

1006
01:22:08,068 --> 01:22:10,059
I can't face the responsibility.

1007
01:22:10,771 --> 01:22:12,966
That's what it really comes down to.

1008
01:22:14,541 --> 01:22:18,341
I sit in the confessional,
listening to someone tell his sins...

1009
01:22:19,780 --> 01:22:22,271
and I'm the one who's trembling in terror.

1010
01:22:25,352 --> 01:22:27,547
I don't know what will become of me.

1011
01:22:28,722 --> 01:22:31,850
I must find what else I can do.

1012
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:36,420
But I think, I pray...

1013
01:22:38,198 --> 01:22:40,894
that there may be
another kind of life for me.

1014
01:22:41,535 --> 01:22:43,526
A life I was meant for...

1015
01:22:45,806 --> 01:22:47,740
that will let me sleep nights.

1016
01:22:52,746 --> 01:22:53,735
Steve...

1017
01:22:55,816 --> 01:22:58,444
I'm going to ask you
to do something for me...

1018
01:22:59,152 --> 01:23:01,677
because I think you're wrong
about yourself.

1019
01:23:03,257 --> 01:23:06,749
I think I see your problem
more objectively than you can.

1020
01:23:09,062 --> 01:23:13,260
Regardless of how it came about,
you were meant to be a priest.

1021
01:23:16,503 --> 01:23:18,971
I'm going to ask you
to postpone your decision.

1022
01:23:19,039 --> 01:23:21,507
There's something
I can do as your bishop.

1023
01:23:22,276 --> 01:23:26,610
It's seldom done, but I can grant you
a leave of absence from active priesthood.

1024
01:23:27,147 --> 01:23:28,978
I'll tell Giacobbi...

1025
01:23:29,516 --> 01:23:32,713
it's for reasons of health. And it is.

1026
01:23:33,887 --> 01:23:35,582
The health of your soul.

1027
01:23:37,457 --> 01:23:41,257
Priesthood isn't something
you can put on and take off...

1028
01:23:41,328 --> 01:23:43,091
like the cassock you wear.

1029
01:23:44,531 --> 01:23:45,896
It's part of you.

1030
01:23:48,502 --> 01:23:50,060
Think about it, Steve.

1031
01:23:50,737 --> 01:23:53,399
Take a year, take two years.

1032
01:23:55,642 --> 01:23:58,975
If at the end of that time,
you're still of the same mind...

1033
01:24:00,147 --> 01:24:04,379
I'll do all in my power to get you
a dispensation from your vows.

1034
01:24:05,419 --> 01:24:06,408
But...

1035
01:24:07,821 --> 01:24:10,483
should you wish to remain a priest...

1036
01:24:12,092 --> 01:24:16,495
I'm sure the Holy Father can be persuaded
to keep the position open for you here.

1037
01:24:19,032 --> 01:24:22,160
Will you do this much, Steve...

1038
01:24:23,737 --> 01:24:26,706
for me and for yourself?

1039
01:29:13,906 --> 01:29:17,364
Because of the holiday,
we won't be meeting again for two weeks.

1040
01:29:17,443 --> 01:29:21,880
Before our next class, I would like
you to prepare a conversation in English...

1041
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:25,978
about a trip in an automobile
from Vienna to Salzburg.

1042
01:29:26,819 --> 01:29:28,650
Until then, auf Wiedersehen.

1043
01:29:43,436 --> 01:29:46,166
'Bye, sir.
I hope you have very fine holidays.

1044
01:29:46,272 --> 01:29:48,706
I'm looking forward
to seeing you again in 14 days.

1045
01:29:48,774 --> 01:29:50,708
- Goodbye.
- Thank you very much.

1046
01:29:52,411 --> 01:29:54,038
Thank you, same to you.

1047
01:29:54,246 --> 01:29:56,407
Yes, Miss Lederbohl?

1048
01:29:56,515 --> 01:29:59,109
Nothing. Have a nice holiday.

1049
01:29:59,719 --> 01:30:00,845
Thank you.

1050
01:30:40,726 --> 01:30:44,321
Mr. Fermoyle,
do you mind if I walk with you?

1051
01:30:44,397 --> 01:30:46,797
- No, not at all.
- We go the same way.

1052
01:30:48,167 --> 01:30:49,794
Tell me about America.

1053
01:30:49,902 --> 01:30:52,530
- In 25 words, or less?
- Or more.

1054
01:30:52,705 --> 01:30:55,606
I've got all afternoon and evening
if you need it.

1055
01:30:55,674 --> 01:30:58,006
- I want to be prepared.
- Prepared for what?

1056
01:30:58,077 --> 01:31:00,170
My dream is to go to America someday...

1057
01:31:00,246 --> 01:31:03,773
where people think about the future,
instead of always the past.

1058
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:10,415
Please invite me for a cup of coffee.

1059
01:31:10,956 --> 01:31:12,048
All right.

1060
01:31:37,049 --> 01:31:39,313
Where would you like to go in America?

1061
01:31:39,385 --> 01:31:42,946
First to New York, of course.
Then, I haven't made up my mind yet.

1062
01:31:43,022 --> 01:31:44,717
Where do you think I should go?

1063
01:31:44,790 --> 01:31:47,350
- Where are you from?
- Boston.

1064
01:31:47,426 --> 01:31:49,758
Boston. That's in Massakewsetts.

1065
01:31:49,829 --> 01:31:52,821
Massachusetts.

1066
01:31:53,432 --> 01:31:54,956
Tell me about Boston.

1067
01:31:57,703 --> 01:31:59,830
All of a sudden I don't know what to say.

1068
01:31:59,905 --> 01:32:03,306
I was born in Boston, grew up there,
with my family.

1069
01:32:03,375 --> 01:32:06,105
When I was a boy,
we used to swim in the river...

1070
01:32:06,512 --> 01:32:09,037
I guess that's hardly an inducement
to visit Boston.

1071
01:32:09,115 --> 01:32:10,605
I will go to Boston.

1072
01:32:11,750 --> 01:32:13,877
Tell me, what do you do?

1073
01:32:14,587 --> 01:32:17,522
- I teach.
- I mean when you're not teaching.

1074
01:32:17,623 --> 01:32:20,421
Do you go out to the theater, to parties?

1075
01:32:21,193 --> 01:32:22,683
Who are your friends?

1076
01:32:23,062 --> 01:32:25,622
I tried to find out,
but no one seems to know.

1077
01:32:26,165 --> 01:32:30,499
Sometimes I think all you do is sit
alone in your room in the Stallburggasse.

1078
01:32:31,203 --> 01:32:33,034
How do you know where I live?

1079
01:32:33,105 --> 01:32:34,402
I followed you.

1080
01:32:37,009 --> 01:32:39,102
You're different than other men.

1081
01:32:39,645 --> 01:32:40,976
"From" other men.

1082
01:32:41,046 --> 01:32:43,947
- You know how to wait.
- How to wait for what?

1083
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,542
For "whom."

1084
01:32:47,553 --> 01:32:50,044
What are you going to do
over the holidays?

1085
01:32:50,789 --> 01:32:55,021
I guess I'll just sit all by myself
in my room in the Stallburggasse.

1086
01:32:55,094 --> 01:32:57,085
- You want to know something?
- Yes.

1087
01:32:57,163 --> 01:32:58,892
I won't let you do that.

1088
01:33:26,625 --> 01:33:30,220
Before the war there was no choice
for a girl, only to be married.

1089
01:33:30,729 --> 01:33:32,663
Now there are not enough men.

1090
01:33:32,865 --> 01:33:34,662
Families have lost their money.

1091
01:33:34,733 --> 01:33:37,566
Most of my friends have jobs,
or try to find them.

1092
01:33:38,103 --> 01:33:42,437
So people think I'm lucky to have
a rich young man who wants to marry me.

1093
01:33:42,508 --> 01:33:45,170
Do you? Think you're lucky?

1094
01:33:45,945 --> 01:33:47,173
I'm not sure.

1095
01:33:48,013 --> 01:33:50,880
For me to work at a job,
that is not to be a woman.

1096
01:33:51,817 --> 01:33:54,945
I think there's one thing I could do well.

1097
01:33:55,654 --> 01:33:57,713
One thing I was born for.

1098
01:33:58,757 --> 01:34:00,054
To love a man.

1099
01:34:01,026 --> 01:34:04,325
To love him so much
that my whole life is to make him happy.

1100
01:34:04,897 --> 01:34:07,263
If that's true, then I should think...

1101
01:34:07,766 --> 01:34:11,327
When it is my whole life,
it is important I find the right man.

1102
01:34:14,707 --> 01:34:17,642
- All I do is talk about myself.
- And about Vienna.

1103
01:34:17,810 --> 01:34:19,607
And you talk about America.

1104
01:34:19,712 --> 01:34:21,805
But not about Stephen Fermoyle.

1105
01:34:22,881 --> 01:34:24,508
Not much to talk about.

1106
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:28,351
I've been in Europe about a year and a half.
Teaching, mostly.

1107
01:34:28,420 --> 01:34:31,981
First in Milan, then Munich, now Vienna.

1108
01:34:32,124 --> 01:34:35,525
I just go wherever the
International Language School sends me.

1109
01:34:36,095 --> 01:34:39,428
But what did you do before?
I mean, in Boston. What did you do there?

1110
01:34:39,498 --> 01:34:41,295
Why did you come to Europe?

1111
01:34:43,335 --> 01:34:45,496
Aren't we supposed to get off here?

1112
01:34:51,443 --> 01:34:53,707
The abbey was founded in 1410...

1113
01:34:54,346 --> 01:34:56,940
the church built in a rich Baroque style...

1114
01:34:57,516 --> 01:34:59,814
1721-25.

1115
01:34:59,952 --> 01:35:03,911
It has a tower. Possibly the finest
Baroque tower of Austria.

1116
01:35:04,056 --> 01:35:05,580
You sound like Baedeker.

1117
01:35:05,658 --> 01:35:07,956
I'm just trying to keep it impersonal.

1118
01:35:21,173 --> 01:35:25,269
The chief attractions of the interior
are the stucco reliefs on the ceiling.

1119
01:35:26,145 --> 01:35:28,409
The altar paintings by Schmidt of Krems.

1120
01:35:28,480 --> 01:35:31,472
The pulpit richly carved by his father,
Johann Schmidt.

1121
01:35:31,550 --> 01:35:34,451
- And the choir stalls...
- Yes, I know all about them.

1122
01:35:35,020 --> 01:35:36,612
I've been here before.

1123
01:35:37,222 --> 01:35:39,315
- You have?
- Many times.

1124
01:35:40,225 --> 01:35:41,214
Why?

1125
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:43,552
I come here to pray.

1126
01:35:45,798 --> 01:35:47,493
You're a strange man.

1127
01:35:48,133 --> 01:35:49,828
I'm a priest, Annemarie.

1128
01:35:51,570 --> 01:35:53,265
I'm on a leave of absence.

1129
01:35:54,039 --> 01:35:57,839
Once in a great while,
when a priest is unsure of his vocation...

1130
01:35:57,910 --> 01:36:00,174
he is granted time to think about it.

1131
01:36:00,612 --> 01:36:02,512
What happens when your time is over?

1132
01:36:02,581 --> 01:36:05,448
I must decide whether I want
to go on being a priest...

1133
01:36:05,517 --> 01:36:09,146
or ask for a dispensation from my vows,
if I can get one.

1134
01:36:09,988 --> 01:36:12,616
In the meantime,
those vows are still binding.

1135
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:17,921
Will it be harder for you to be with me,
now that you've told me?

1136
01:36:18,097 --> 01:36:20,088
No harder than before, I think.

1137
01:36:20,466 --> 01:36:22,058
Because if I thought...

1138
01:36:22,768 --> 01:36:26,135
I was having an influence,
directly or not directly...

1139
01:36:26,538 --> 01:36:28,335
on what you will decide...

1140
01:36:28,874 --> 01:36:30,432
Yes, if you did?

1141
01:36:33,178 --> 01:36:35,408
I would make it, how does one say?

1142
01:36:36,415 --> 01:36:38,280
A full-time career.

1143
01:36:49,995 --> 01:36:51,087
Annemarie.

1144
01:36:52,598 --> 01:36:54,759
There will be no arguments about tonight.

1145
01:36:54,833 --> 01:36:58,291
You have to see a Viennese ball,
and this is the last one of the season.

1146
01:36:58,370 --> 01:37:00,167
I rented everything you need.

1147
01:37:00,239 --> 01:37:01,228
Look.

1148
01:37:03,075 --> 01:37:04,406
Tails...

1149
01:37:06,044 --> 01:37:08,274
evening shirt, white tie...

1150
01:37:08,781 --> 01:37:11,306
- west.
- "Vest."

1151
01:37:12,684 --> 01:37:14,447
And a cape.

1152
01:37:17,156 --> 01:37:19,886
And Manschettenknöpfe.
How do you call that?

1153
01:37:20,592 --> 01:37:22,457
- Cufflinks.
- Cufflinks. And this?

1154
01:37:22,528 --> 01:37:23,517
Studs.

1155
01:37:23,729 --> 01:37:25,356
And chapeau claque.

1156
01:37:36,041 --> 01:37:37,770
- Good evening, Kurt.
- Good evening.

1157
01:37:38,577 --> 01:37:41,068
- You look wonderful tonight.
- Thank you.

1158
01:37:41,146 --> 01:37:42,841
I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Fermoyle.

1159
01:37:43,048 --> 01:37:44,879
Stephen, this is Kurt von Hartman.

1160
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:47,350
- Herr von Hartman.
- Mr. Fermoyle, how do you do?

1161
01:37:47,419 --> 01:37:49,353
- You're American, aren't you?
- Yes.

1162
01:37:49,421 --> 01:37:52,652
Then you are used to lending
your treasures to impoverished Europe.

1163
01:37:52,724 --> 01:37:55,420
May I have this dance please? Annemarie?

1164
01:37:55,627 --> 01:37:57,026
Excuse me.

1165
01:38:24,122 --> 01:38:26,454
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

1166
01:38:26,959 --> 01:38:29,257
I heard you say you were from America.

1167
01:38:29,995 --> 01:38:33,260
Is it really true
one is not allowed to drink...

1168
01:38:33,398 --> 01:38:35,127
even beer and wine?

1169
01:38:35,567 --> 01:38:38,297
Are they insane to make this Prohibition?

1170
01:38:38,737 --> 01:38:42,571
The people who voted for it obviously
think that any means is justified...

1171
01:38:42,641 --> 01:38:45,804
to eliminate the evils of drunkenness.
Excuse me.

1172
01:39:15,274 --> 01:39:17,435
You know what that Prohibition is like?

1173
01:39:17,509 --> 01:39:20,376
It's like they want to eliminate
the evils of rape...

1174
01:39:20,445 --> 01:39:23,278
and so they pass a law
against making love.

1175
01:39:23,515 --> 01:39:26,177
Can you imagine a life
without making love?

1176
01:40:07,159 --> 01:40:08,387
Excuse me.

1177
01:40:14,766 --> 01:40:16,961
- I'm sorry, Stephen.
- For what?

1178
01:40:17,336 --> 01:40:18,997
For leaving you alone.

1179
01:40:19,104 --> 01:40:20,935
At a ball you should dance.

1180
01:40:21,440 --> 01:40:22,737
But you can't.

1181
01:40:24,376 --> 01:40:26,469
He seems like a very nice fellow.

1182
01:40:26,745 --> 01:40:29,543
Kurt? Yes, he is.

1183
01:40:30,215 --> 01:40:32,012
He's the one who wants to marry you?

1184
01:40:32,084 --> 01:40:33,711
Yes. Are you jealous?

1185
01:40:35,454 --> 01:40:37,183
I'm a priest, Annemarie.

1186
01:40:37,456 --> 01:40:39,151
But I'm also a man.

1187
01:40:40,325 --> 01:40:44,261
Men can show their feelings,
but a priest has to learn how to hide them.

1188
01:40:45,063 --> 01:40:46,826
I can't hide them anymore.

1189
01:40:48,600 --> 01:40:50,500
I think I'm in love with you.

1190
01:40:51,169 --> 01:40:53,137
I know I'm in love with you.

1191
01:41:01,680 --> 01:41:05,446
I cannot ask you to kiss me
while you're still married to the Church.

1192
01:41:06,718 --> 01:41:09,516
But in Vienna, even for a married man...

1193
01:41:09,688 --> 01:41:12,555
it is a sin not to dance a waltz.

1194
01:46:42,454 --> 01:46:45,014
You answer this letter from Philadelphia.

1195
01:46:45,957 --> 01:46:49,791
Tell them there will be no private
audiences for at least six weeks.

1196
01:46:51,696 --> 01:46:54,062
Welcome to Vatican City, Father Gillis.

1197
01:46:55,834 --> 01:46:57,392
Monsignor Fermoyle.

1198
01:46:57,469 --> 01:47:00,063
Your letter to the Holy Father
was passed on to me...

1199
01:47:00,138 --> 01:47:02,265
as a consultant on American affairs.

1200
01:47:02,540 --> 01:47:05,236
He'll see me?
The Holy Father will really see me?

1201
01:47:05,310 --> 01:47:07,403
I'm afraid I couldn't arrange that.

1202
01:47:07,479 --> 01:47:10,880
But I have arranged for you
to tell your story to Cardinal Giacobbi.

1203
01:47:10,949 --> 01:47:14,407
That's the next best thing
to a private audience with the Pope.

1204
01:47:15,487 --> 01:47:17,387
I didn't know if I'd hear back at all.

1205
01:47:17,455 --> 01:47:19,753
Since I mailed my letter
the day I got to Rome...

1206
01:47:19,824 --> 01:47:22,258
I've been waiting
to be called to the phone.

1207
01:47:22,327 --> 01:47:23,726
Shall we go along?

1208
01:47:35,573 --> 01:47:37,666
His Eminence is expecting us.

1209
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:52,550
Fermoyle, come in, come in.

1210
01:47:53,158 --> 01:47:57,219
So, this is the American priest
you told us about.

1211
01:47:59,798 --> 01:48:01,959
I'll come back when you're finished.

1212
01:48:02,033 --> 01:48:05,833
No, stay. It will not take long, will it?

1213
01:48:06,071 --> 01:48:10,064
Monsignor Fermoyle
and Cardinal Quarenghi are old friends.

1214
01:48:10,508 --> 01:48:13,875
You find yourself
in a nest of diplomats, Father.

1215
01:48:14,279 --> 01:48:18,409
That means that if anyone of us says
exactly what he's thinking...

1216
01:48:18,917 --> 01:48:20,714
it's a slip of the tongue.

1217
01:48:21,252 --> 01:48:24,517
Sit down.
Please, tell us what we can do for you.

1218
01:48:30,228 --> 01:48:34,528
Father Gillis's parish is in the state
of Georgia, in a town called Lamar.

1219
01:48:34,666 --> 01:48:37,328
His congregation raised the money
for him to come here.

1220
01:48:37,402 --> 01:48:39,427
That's very interesting.

1221
01:48:39,537 --> 01:48:43,268
St. Jude, Your Eminence.
It's called St. Jude, my church.

1222
01:48:43,641 --> 01:48:45,506
The saint of lost causes.

1223
01:48:45,710 --> 01:48:48,008
We should like not to lose this cause.

1224
01:48:48,880 --> 01:48:49,972
You see...

1225
01:48:50,415 --> 01:48:53,646
there is only one Catholic school
in that part of Georgia.

1226
01:48:53,952 --> 01:48:55,078
And, well...

1227
01:48:55,286 --> 01:48:59,279
that school will not take the children
of my parish because they're black.

1228
01:48:59,791 --> 01:49:01,691
- Well?
- Well, Your Eminence...

1229
01:49:01,960 --> 01:49:03,825
is that a Christian thing to do?

1230
01:49:03,895 --> 01:49:06,762
It is against Christian principles
for a Catholic school...

1231
01:49:06,831 --> 01:49:09,129
to turn away a Catholic child
because of race.

1232
01:49:09,200 --> 01:49:10,565
Of course it is.

1233
01:49:10,635 --> 01:49:13,001
But we have the most precise machinery...

1234
01:49:13,071 --> 01:49:15,938
for the proper enforcement
of these principles.

1235
01:49:16,074 --> 01:49:17,666
I did what was proper.

1236
01:49:17,976 --> 01:49:21,002
I went to the dean of the district,
Monsignor Whittle.

1237
01:49:21,446 --> 01:49:24,973
He said he would never ever
let colored children in their school.

1238
01:49:25,150 --> 01:49:26,515
And your bishop?

1239
01:49:26,584 --> 01:49:28,609
I wrote him and didn't get an answer.

1240
01:49:28,686 --> 01:49:32,122
Then you decided
that the only recourse left to you...

1241
01:49:32,257 --> 01:49:35,624
was to come to Rome
and tell your troubles to the Pope?

1242
01:49:35,693 --> 01:49:37,126
Your pardon, Eminence.

1243
01:49:37,195 --> 01:49:40,494
But one thing happened
before Father Gillis decided to come.

1244
01:49:41,132 --> 01:49:43,327
His church was burned to the ground.

1245
01:49:43,434 --> 01:49:45,629
Quite a few of the folks in my parish...

1246
01:49:45,703 --> 01:49:48,171
they feel it's time to make some changes.

1247
01:49:48,339 --> 01:49:51,866
So a bunch of them went and threw
a picket line around that white school.

1248
01:49:51,943 --> 01:49:53,205
They threw what?

1249
01:49:53,278 --> 01:49:57,578
They marched in front of the school
with signs, protesting the discrimination.

1250
01:49:57,849 --> 01:50:00,010
Then I got a lot of phone calls...

1251
01:50:00,251 --> 01:50:02,446
and letters with no names signed.

1252
01:50:03,488 --> 01:50:06,924
And then one night,
these men with white hoods...

1253
01:50:07,692 --> 01:50:09,057
they burned my church.

1254
01:50:09,127 --> 01:50:10,822
Barbarians.

1255
01:50:11,162 --> 01:50:14,996
But still it's scarcely a tribute
to your priestly discretion, is it...

1256
01:50:15,433 --> 01:50:19,164
that your concern with
these peculiar local politics...

1257
01:50:19,437 --> 01:50:21,098
has left you without a church?

1258
01:50:21,172 --> 01:50:22,764
Politics, my dear Giacobbi?

1259
01:50:22,840 --> 01:50:26,139
The desecration, of course,
is a moral issue.

1260
01:50:26,844 --> 01:50:29,813
I was speaking of Father Gillis's activities.

1261
01:50:29,881 --> 01:50:32,372
But discrimination is a moral issue, too.

1262
01:50:32,450 --> 01:50:34,941
It is not necessary to tell me...

1263
01:50:35,019 --> 01:50:39,820
that race prejudice is contrary
to the teachings of Christ and his church.

1264
01:50:40,658 --> 01:50:44,492
The question is,
whether it is wise to use methods...

1265
01:50:44,596 --> 01:50:46,325
that tend to be inflammatory.

1266
01:50:46,397 --> 01:50:50,925
I'm not sure that we can afford
to use methods that tend to be glacial.

1267
01:50:51,269 --> 01:50:55,000
The truth of the matter is that
to the non-white majority of the world...

1268
01:50:55,073 --> 01:50:57,507
there is no more critical test
of our democracy...

1269
01:50:57,575 --> 01:51:01,375
Democracy, my dear Fermoyle,
is neither the ultimate...

1270
01:51:01,512 --> 01:51:05,004
nor necessarily
the best form of government.

1271
01:51:05,750 --> 01:51:09,015
It is simply the favorite doctrine
of a country...

1272
01:51:09,187 --> 01:51:12,748
discovered by an Italian, who thought
he was going someplace else.

1273
01:51:12,991 --> 01:51:16,290
Your Eminence suggests
a stimulating topic for discussion...

1274
01:51:16,494 --> 01:51:19,429
but my point is that what happens
to freedom in America...

1275
01:51:19,497 --> 01:51:21,522
is important to the rest of the world.

1276
01:51:21,599 --> 01:51:25,035
But isn't your precious separation
of church and state...

1277
01:51:25,336 --> 01:51:27,201
a part of that freedom?

1278
01:51:27,338 --> 01:51:30,136
Aren't you always telling us
we may not intrude...

1279
01:51:30,408 --> 01:51:33,309
in the domestic affairs
of your country in any way?

1280
01:51:33,845 --> 01:51:36,746
By your own logic, it is foolish...

1281
01:51:36,981 --> 01:51:40,041
to challenge the deepest feelings
and convictions...

1282
01:51:40,451 --> 01:51:43,352
of the people of...
What is the name of the place?

1283
01:51:43,421 --> 01:51:45,981
- Georgia, Your Eminence.
- Georgia.

1284
01:51:47,025 --> 01:51:50,722
Father Gillis, may I suggest that
your primary obligation is not...

1285
01:51:50,795 --> 01:51:52,888
to political and social reform...

1286
01:51:53,364 --> 01:51:56,026
but to the mortal souls of your flock.

1287
01:51:57,201 --> 01:52:00,398
Thank you, Monsignor,
for bringing us Father Gillis.

1288
01:52:00,471 --> 01:52:02,962
We're always happy
to meet a brother in Christ.

1289
01:52:03,041 --> 01:52:05,942
Let's get back to our work now.

1290
01:52:06,077 --> 01:52:09,444
I really don't remember where we left off.

1291
01:52:35,606 --> 01:52:36,698
Is that it?

1292
01:52:36,974 --> 01:52:38,999
I'd hoped we could dissuade him.

1293
01:52:39,644 --> 01:52:41,805
What will you do when you get back?

1294
01:52:45,116 --> 01:52:46,913
Thank you for your support.

1295
01:53:03,000 --> 01:53:04,934
I must go there, Alfeo.

1296
01:53:05,503 --> 01:53:08,768
I told him he could count on my help
and then I failed him.

1297
01:53:09,374 --> 01:53:13,936
You went as far as you possibly could
within the limits of your function.

1298
01:53:14,512 --> 01:53:17,310
There was another time
somebody relied on me for help.

1299
01:53:17,382 --> 01:53:20,647
I did everything within my function for her,
and it wasn't enough.

1300
01:53:20,718 --> 01:53:23,186
If you made a mistake with your sister...

1301
01:53:23,988 --> 01:53:28,152
if you were too young to be
both priest and brother to her...

1302
01:53:29,127 --> 01:53:31,789
you've atoned for that a long time ago.

1303
01:53:32,530 --> 01:53:35,294
You don't have to find new ways
to torture yourself.

1304
01:53:35,366 --> 01:53:39,325
I just don't want to realize again
that it's too late to accomplish something.

1305
01:53:39,404 --> 01:53:42,464
What is there to accomplish
by following Father Gillis?

1306
01:53:42,573 --> 01:53:45,406
I don't know, but I know I have to do it.

1307
01:53:45,710 --> 01:53:48,338
I don't think it will be a surprise if I say...

1308
01:53:48,413 --> 01:53:52,008
the Pope has given some thought
to naming you a bishop.

1309
01:53:52,417 --> 01:53:54,408
I've heard a certain amount of talk.

1310
01:53:54,485 --> 01:53:57,784
- You can't tell me it doesn't matter to you.
- It matters very much.

1311
01:53:57,855 --> 01:54:00,653
But it also matters to me
what happens to Gillis.

1312
01:54:01,225 --> 01:54:03,625
I'll try not to compromise the Holy See.

1313
01:54:03,728 --> 01:54:06,128
I don't have to be an official emissary.

1314
01:54:06,230 --> 01:54:08,755
You still need
the Holy Father's permission...

1315
01:54:08,833 --> 01:54:11,393
which means Giacobbi's, unfortunately.

1316
01:54:12,703 --> 01:54:15,194
Do you suppose
the thought might enter his mind...

1317
01:54:15,273 --> 01:54:17,764
that I could make
a fool of myself in Georgia?

1318
01:54:17,842 --> 01:54:18,900
It might.

1319
01:54:18,976 --> 01:54:21,740
What if you started him thinking
along that line?

1320
01:54:21,813 --> 01:54:24,281
Why would I want to discredit you?

1321
01:54:24,348 --> 01:54:28,682
It might occur to him that this trip could
lessen my chances to become a bishop.

1322
01:54:29,086 --> 01:54:33,022
Which could be just the incentive he needs
to grant me permission to go.

1323
01:54:33,758 --> 01:54:37,717
Heaven forgive me
for starting you off in diplomacy.

1324
01:54:53,444 --> 01:54:54,843
All right, Father.

1325
01:54:56,414 --> 01:54:59,315
Uncle Steve, it's so wonderful to see you.

1326
01:54:59,484 --> 01:55:04,251
Regina, I'd like you to meet a shipboard
friend of mine, Father Eberling.

1327
01:55:04,388 --> 01:55:07,721
Father, I'm sorry. This is awful.

1328
01:55:07,792 --> 01:55:10,659
I don't imagine Father Eberling
found it too painful.

1329
01:55:10,728 --> 01:55:12,958
Nicest welcome home I ever had.

1330
01:55:14,532 --> 01:55:15,521
Now.

1331
01:55:16,334 --> 01:55:17,494
Uncle Steve.

1332
01:55:18,503 --> 01:55:21,301
I'm so glad you're you, I mean, not him.

1333
01:55:21,405 --> 01:55:23,703
You're so much better looking,
and younger.

1334
01:55:23,774 --> 01:55:27,039
With that blarney and your looks,
you'll have your pick of husbands.

1335
01:55:30,348 --> 01:55:32,179
- Anything to declare?
- Nothing.

1336
01:55:32,250 --> 01:55:33,649
Thank you, Father.

1337
01:55:35,453 --> 01:55:37,512
Yeah, I'll get the bags.

1338
01:55:39,524 --> 01:55:40,513
Steve.

1339
01:55:42,393 --> 01:55:46,159
Boy, you look great.
How do you keep the old weight down?

1340
01:55:46,230 --> 01:55:48,494
Prayer, Frank. And a strict calorie count.

1341
01:55:48,566 --> 01:55:50,363
- How's it going?
- Pretty good.

1342
01:55:50,434 --> 01:55:52,800
No money,
but I'm knocking 'em dead every night.

1343
01:55:52,870 --> 01:55:55,202
Singing in one of the best speakeasies
in town.

1344
01:55:55,273 --> 01:55:57,605
I hope to be able to hear you
before I go back.

1345
01:55:57,675 --> 01:55:58,903
What are your plans?

1346
01:55:58,976 --> 01:56:01,774
That's the trouble.
You shouldn't have come to New York.

1347
01:56:01,846 --> 01:56:05,247
Who said I shouldn't?
Am I some sort of an old lady...

1348
01:56:05,316 --> 01:56:09,275
I meant I have to catch a train this
afternoon. We barely have time for lunch.

1349
01:56:09,353 --> 01:56:10,479
But it's worth it.

1350
01:56:10,555 --> 01:56:14,082
I don't like you spending the money.
Round-trip fares for you and Regina?

1351
01:56:14,158 --> 01:56:18,288
- Are you really sorry I brought her?
- She's an absolute delight, ravishing.

1352
01:56:18,629 --> 01:56:22,895
Having her around has made it easier
for me to accept God's will.

1353
01:56:23,134 --> 01:56:25,602
Seeing her now has made it easier for me.

1354
01:57:00,304 --> 01:57:01,396
Excuse me?

1355
01:57:02,139 --> 01:57:03,800
Where does Father Gillis live?

1356
01:57:03,874 --> 01:57:05,774
- Right over there.
- Thank you.

1357
01:57:23,861 --> 01:57:26,728
- Monsignor.
- Father Fermoyle from Boston, for now.

1358
01:57:27,832 --> 01:57:29,060
Do come in.

1359
01:57:33,237 --> 01:57:36,172
Monsignor Whittle,
this is Father Fermoyle.

1360
01:57:36,474 --> 01:57:37,873
- How do you do?
- Hello.

1361
01:57:37,942 --> 01:57:39,204
Sheriff Dubrow.

1362
01:57:39,276 --> 01:57:41,369
What brings you to Lamar, Father?

1363
01:57:41,646 --> 01:57:43,614
I'm a friend of Father Gillis.

1364
01:57:43,681 --> 01:57:45,945
I hope I'm not interrupting anything.

1365
01:57:46,484 --> 01:57:48,748
I've already said what I come to say.

1366
01:57:48,919 --> 01:57:51,410
There's a law against arson in this state.

1367
01:57:51,489 --> 01:57:54,947
So I had to do my job.
When Gillis here, Father Gillis...

1368
01:57:55,660 --> 01:57:58,595
made out a complaint,
I brought the charges.

1369
01:57:59,296 --> 01:58:02,026
Tomorrow he can get up
in the trial and testify.

1370
01:58:02,700 --> 01:58:05,430
That is, unless you can talk
some sense into him.

1371
01:58:05,603 --> 01:58:09,198
He's your boy, not mine.
Know what I mean?

1372
01:58:09,407 --> 01:58:11,034
I don't. What do you mean?

1373
01:58:11,108 --> 01:58:15,306
That there's trouble for everybody,
for him, for me, for the Church.

1374
01:58:16,514 --> 01:58:20,780
- What are you doing here, Father?
- I told you, I'm a friend of Father Gillis.

1375
01:58:21,752 --> 01:58:24,653
As a friend, I wish you'd tell
this hard-headed boy...

1376
01:58:24,722 --> 01:58:27,247
He's not a boy, Monsignor, he's a priest.

1377
01:58:28,859 --> 01:58:31,555
Do you presume
to correct my terminology, Father?

1378
01:58:31,629 --> 01:58:35,087
I simply meant to remind you
that we are all brothers in Christ.

1379
01:58:35,166 --> 01:58:39,296
Then, my Yankee brother,
will you tell this Father Gillis...

1380
01:58:39,470 --> 01:58:41,563
that he must not testify?

1381
01:58:42,907 --> 01:58:47,003
'Cause people around here,
they're in an awful ugly mood.

1382
01:58:47,144 --> 01:58:48,771
Do you want to testify?

1383
01:58:49,280 --> 01:58:50,907
- Yes, Father.
- Good.

1384
01:58:51,749 --> 01:58:54,149
Father Gillis will be at the trial tomorrow.

1385
01:58:54,218 --> 01:58:57,210
That does it.
That just about puts the lid on it.

1386
01:58:58,355 --> 01:59:01,483
Look, you know nothing
of the conditions around here...

1387
01:59:01,592 --> 01:59:03,753
Monsignor, a church has been burned.

1388
01:59:04,028 --> 01:59:06,826
Charges have been brought,
testimony must be given.

1389
01:59:06,897 --> 01:59:09,627
What is so unusual
about due process of law?

1390
01:59:10,668 --> 01:59:13,102
I recognize a Yankee...

1391
01:59:13,170 --> 01:59:16,571
sanctimonious self-righteousness.

1392
01:59:19,143 --> 01:59:21,373
You will not testify, Father.

1393
01:59:22,079 --> 01:59:24,138
You will withdraw your complaint.

1394
01:59:25,382 --> 01:59:26,371
You...

1395
01:59:26,984 --> 01:59:31,045
you will give me the name of your superior
to whom I will report you.

1396
01:59:45,035 --> 01:59:46,730
You were sent here from Rome?

1397
01:59:46,804 --> 01:59:48,396
I'm here unofficially.

1398
01:59:48,939 --> 01:59:52,102
My presence is
a confidential matter between us.

1399
01:59:52,610 --> 01:59:54,635
But it's my strong opinion...

1400
01:59:54,845 --> 01:59:58,076
that we must allow Father Gillis
to act as he sees fit.

1401
01:59:58,582 --> 02:00:00,345
Just as you say, Monsignor.

1402
02:00:00,684 --> 02:00:04,142
I assume that he can count on you
for your support in whatever he does.

1403
02:00:04,221 --> 02:00:06,985
- Yes, but...
- Then perhaps we can discuss the details...

1404
02:00:07,057 --> 02:00:09,321
of that support on the way into town...

1405
02:00:09,426 --> 02:00:10,916
if you can drive me.

1406
02:00:11,362 --> 02:00:13,387
I'd like to find a hotel.

1407
02:00:13,464 --> 02:00:15,625
Of course. I'd be delighted.

1408
02:00:15,699 --> 02:00:17,394
I'll get in touch with you later.

1409
02:00:17,468 --> 02:00:21,097
I can't believe you're here.
I didn't think anybody cared.

1410
02:00:21,338 --> 02:00:23,363
Have you so little faith?

1411
02:00:42,927 --> 02:00:45,953
The hotels are
on the other side of the square.

1412
02:00:59,944 --> 02:01:01,707
Who told you that?

1413
02:01:02,012 --> 02:01:06,142
I don't need anybody to tell me, Father.
It's in the Bible.

1414
02:01:08,419 --> 02:01:11,115
Is it also God's law to burn churches?

1415
02:01:11,188 --> 02:01:14,988
We had nothing to do with that, Father.
I'm a good Catholic.

1416
02:01:16,794 --> 02:01:19,092
They must be members
of your congregation.

1417
02:01:19,163 --> 02:01:23,361
You've got to see the problem, Monsignor.
We're in the minority here, too.

1418
02:01:23,434 --> 02:01:27,427
I'm sure you wouldn't have permitted
this demonstration if you'd known of it.

1419
02:01:27,771 --> 02:01:30,501
I'll see that it's stopped immediately.

1420
02:01:33,711 --> 02:01:37,977
Good people,
can I just talk to you for a minute?

1421
02:01:38,749 --> 02:01:40,842
What's going on there?

1422
02:02:09,680 --> 02:02:11,773
You want something, mister?

1423
02:02:11,849 --> 02:02:14,181
I need a room for a couple of nights.

1424
02:02:14,318 --> 02:02:17,776
It just so happens
we don't have any rooms available.

1425
02:02:17,955 --> 02:02:21,914
I kind of get the impression
you've been meddling, padre.

1426
02:02:22,927 --> 02:02:26,328
Looked to me like it was you
who got that picket line called off.

1427
02:02:26,397 --> 02:02:31,096
For a Catholic priest to offer advice
to members of his faith is not meddling.

1428
02:02:31,168 --> 02:02:34,069
Maybe you don't know
what's going on in this town.

1429
02:02:34,138 --> 02:02:37,596
Some nigger is trying to make trouble
for some white folks.

1430
02:02:37,675 --> 02:02:40,838
- Some nigger priest.
- Some nigger Catholic priest.

1431
02:02:40,911 --> 02:02:43,778
You can't really get much lower than that.

1432
02:02:45,149 --> 02:02:48,277
Perhaps you could recommend
a good tourist home?

1433
02:02:48,552 --> 02:02:52,852
If you're a tourist, get touring before
you've got something to be sorry for.

1434
02:02:52,923 --> 02:02:56,518
You ain't going to find a bed tonight.
Not in this town.

1435
02:02:56,660 --> 02:03:00,790
I don't know, Cecil.
Maybe he could find a bed in niggertown.

1436
02:03:01,231 --> 02:03:02,630
Yeah, that's right.

1437
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:06,796
Maybe some licorice-stick bitch
won't mind squeezing over for you.

1438
02:03:12,977 --> 02:03:14,968
What do you think, Cecil?

1439
02:03:16,714 --> 02:03:19,979
I think we got ourselves
a little job this evening.

1440
02:04:04,762 --> 02:04:06,957
Give me the Sheriff's office.

1441
02:06:15,692 --> 02:06:17,182
All right.

1442
02:06:24,601 --> 02:06:28,298
What do you call this thing?
I mean, the fancy name?

1443
02:06:29,206 --> 02:06:30,571
A crucifix.

1444
02:06:30,641 --> 02:06:34,236
Yeah, that's what the nigger called it
when we took it from him.

1445
02:06:34,311 --> 02:06:36,336
Only he was queer for it.

1446
02:06:37,181 --> 02:06:41,379
He kept wanting to kiss it
while we was strengthening his character.

1447
02:06:42,085 --> 02:06:44,576
We ain't gonna stand for that kind of stuff.

1448
02:06:44,655 --> 02:06:49,251
You know what you're going to have to do
with this little old statue, padre?

1449
02:06:49,326 --> 02:06:51,419
You're going to spit on it.

1450
02:06:51,662 --> 02:06:53,789
And what would that prove...

1451
02:06:53,997 --> 02:06:58,730
except you've been able to scare one
priest into defiling the image of Christ?

1452
02:06:59,269 --> 02:07:01,260
Maybe that's just plenty.

1453
02:07:01,538 --> 02:07:05,804
You'll tell them other nigger-lovers
up north they ain't welcome here.

1454
02:07:05,876 --> 02:07:07,605
Now you spit on it.

1455
02:07:08,378 --> 02:07:10,608
I said for you to spit on it!

1456
02:07:12,382 --> 02:07:16,375
All right, keep going. Give it to him!

1457
02:07:21,758 --> 02:07:25,558
Maybe he needs a little music.
Got your harmonica?

1458
02:10:34,851 --> 02:10:39,584
Guaranteed to heal cuts, ringworm,
harness sores and...

1459
02:10:40,090 --> 02:10:41,819
foot welts.

1460
02:10:44,628 --> 02:10:46,061
Who are you?

1461
02:10:46,596 --> 02:10:48,029
Name's Lafe.

1462
02:10:50,467 --> 02:10:52,196
You live in Lamar?

1463
02:10:52,969 --> 02:10:54,402
All my life.

1464
02:10:57,674 --> 02:10:59,301
Are you Catholic?

1465
02:11:00,043 --> 02:11:01,067
No.

1466
02:11:03,013 --> 02:11:05,140
Then why are you doing this?

1467
02:11:06,216 --> 02:11:07,945
I ain't doing much.

1468
02:11:08,919 --> 02:11:11,012
Do you think you can walk?

1469
02:11:12,756 --> 02:11:14,121
I can try.

1470
02:11:16,426 --> 02:11:20,294
I'll take you to Owassa Junction.
You can get a train north there.

1471
02:11:20,430 --> 02:11:22,398
I'm going back to Lamar.

1472
02:11:22,499 --> 02:11:25,434
There's a trial starting there this morning.

1473
02:11:25,936 --> 02:11:29,372
In a quiet way,
you're kind of a hard man, aren't you?

1474
02:11:29,973 --> 02:11:32,271
My car's just across the field.

1475
02:11:35,846 --> 02:11:37,871
You knew where to find me.

1476
02:11:40,083 --> 02:11:42,415
You were one of them last night.

1477
02:11:53,063 --> 02:11:57,830
When you start something you don't
always know how you'll feel about it later.

1478
02:11:59,603 --> 02:12:02,800
- Last night...
- Don't try to talk. Play.

1479
02:12:44,548 --> 02:12:47,108
- Stefano!
- Alfeo.

1480
02:12:47,183 --> 02:12:49,014
Monsignor Fermoyle.

1481
02:12:49,252 --> 02:12:53,211
We had such a desire to talk to you,
but you couldn't be reached.

1482
02:12:53,356 --> 02:12:56,416
I came back to Europe
on a small ship, Your Eminence.

1483
02:12:56,493 --> 02:12:58,961
I needed time for meditation.

1484
02:12:59,195 --> 02:13:01,789
Your publicity traveled more quickly.

1485
02:13:01,865 --> 02:13:05,494
It served to remind us all
of your flair for the theatrical.

1486
02:13:05,569 --> 02:13:08,834
If I'd chosen the theatricals,
I'd have staged them differently.

1487
02:13:08,905 --> 02:13:12,432
When Quarenghi and I discussed
your trip to America...

1488
02:13:12,809 --> 02:13:16,540
I had the distinct impression
it would be an unofficial one.

1489
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:20,343
There were more than 30 witnesses
to that display of violence.

1490
02:13:20,417 --> 02:13:24,183
Some talked. The reporters at the trial
had the story soon enough.

1491
02:13:24,254 --> 02:13:26,654
What seems important is the result.

1492
02:13:26,723 --> 02:13:30,921
A group of racists convicted
on the testimony of a Negro priest.

1493
02:13:31,261 --> 02:13:35,129
Convicted not of arson,
but of some minor infraction.

1494
02:13:35,265 --> 02:13:37,699
Disorderly conduct. That doesn't matter.

1495
02:13:37,767 --> 02:13:41,726
It's the first conviction of a white man
in that part of the country...

1496
02:13:41,805 --> 02:13:43,432
on the word of a Negro.

1497
02:13:43,506 --> 02:13:46,339
What is the price of victory
in this skirmish?

1498
02:13:46,409 --> 02:13:51,403
You plunge the Vatican into controversy,
which many of your leading prelates...

1499
02:13:51,581 --> 02:13:53,481
have advised us to avoid.

1500
02:13:53,550 --> 02:13:57,077
They're only fooling themselves.
They must face up to it eventually.

1501
02:13:57,153 --> 02:14:00,816
Eventually, by all means.
A slow process of education.

1502
02:14:01,057 --> 02:14:05,585
In the meantime, kids without
decent education now will die of old age...

1503
02:14:05,695 --> 02:14:08,129
before you do anything to help them.

1504
02:14:08,198 --> 02:14:10,428
I didn't mean to involve the Church.

1505
02:14:10,500 --> 02:14:13,901
Now that it's happened,
I'm not sure it isn't a desirable thing.

1506
02:14:13,970 --> 02:14:16,234
Desirable for whom, Monsignor?

1507
02:14:16,740 --> 02:14:19,868
For your private causes
or for the Holy Church?

1508
02:14:19,943 --> 02:14:22,241
Does your concept of desirability...

1509
02:14:22,312 --> 02:14:27,011
include splitting Catholic opinion
in America right down the middle?

1510
02:14:27,083 --> 02:14:29,415
Some of us feel, dear brother...

1511
02:14:29,486 --> 02:14:33,479
that it is precisely
a clear Vatican policy in these matters...

1512
02:14:33,923 --> 02:14:36,050
that might prevent such a split.

1513
02:14:36,126 --> 02:14:38,890
We all have our own opinions,
dear brother.

1514
02:14:38,962 --> 02:14:41,988
We can only place them
before the Holy Father...

1515
02:14:42,766 --> 02:14:46,293
and so discover which of them is correct.

1516
02:15:04,554 --> 02:15:08,217
What do you think, Alfeo?
Will the Pope feel I was indiscreet?

1517
02:15:09,526 --> 02:15:13,690
Well, your job was supposed to be
consulting on American affairs...

1518
02:15:14,397 --> 02:15:17,491
not hurling yourself into the thick of them.

1519
02:15:18,435 --> 02:15:22,098
I wouldn't recommend it
as the ideal way to become a bishop.

1520
02:15:22,205 --> 02:15:26,301
If there was so much commotion here,
he's probably heard about it already.

1521
02:15:26,376 --> 02:15:29,311
If not, you can be sure he will now.

1522
02:15:30,313 --> 02:15:34,272
And it won't be long after that
before you know the result.

1523
02:20:03,453 --> 02:20:05,614
March 13, 1938.

1524
02:20:06,356 --> 02:20:08,187
Hitler enters Vienna...

1525
02:20:08,858 --> 02:20:12,624
at 5:30 p.m.,
welcomed by enthusiastic crowds.

1526
02:20:27,610 --> 02:20:32,138
Cardinal Innitzer, Archbishop of Vienna,
reads a letter signed by him...

1527
02:20:32,648 --> 02:20:36,744
and all the other Austrian bishops,
welcoming Hitler to Austria.

1528
02:20:43,793 --> 02:20:48,594
We acknowledge happily that
the National Socialist movement has...

1529
02:20:49,032 --> 02:20:51,193
for the German Reich and people...

1530
02:20:51,267 --> 02:20:54,464
and especially
for the underprivileged classes...

1531
02:20:54,537 --> 02:20:56,767
achieved outstanding progress.

1532
02:21:01,577 --> 02:21:05,479
The bishops are extending
their blessings and best wishes...

1533
02:21:05,548 --> 02:21:07,914
for the future of these efforts.

1534
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:14,521
On the day of the plebiscite,
it is for us bishops...

1535
02:21:15,224 --> 02:21:17,886
a natural, national obligation...

1536
02:21:18,361 --> 02:21:22,491
to declare ourselves as Germans
and as part of the German Reich.

1537
02:21:23,900 --> 02:21:26,801
We expect of all faithful Catholics...

1538
02:21:27,136 --> 02:21:29,969
that they will know
what they owe to their people.

1539
02:21:35,812 --> 02:21:37,905
That's enough!

1540
02:21:39,182 --> 02:21:42,879
You are familiar with Vienna,
aren't you, Bishop Fermoyle?

1541
02:21:43,152 --> 02:21:44,585
Yes, I am, Your Eminence.

1542
02:21:44,654 --> 02:21:48,112
I'm going to ask the Holy Father
to send you there immediately.

1543
02:21:48,424 --> 02:21:51,689
Your official function will be
to shut down the nunciature.

1544
02:21:51,928 --> 02:21:54,055
And my unofficial function?

1545
02:21:54,163 --> 02:21:56,427
It will be an educational one.

1546
02:21:56,866 --> 02:22:01,394
Instructing a prince of the Church
in the realities of the modern world.

1547
02:22:25,428 --> 02:22:28,693
The first thing we noticed
on the screen, Your Eminence...

1548
02:22:28,764 --> 02:22:31,790
was that all the church bells
rang as Hitler entered Vienna.

1549
02:22:31,868 --> 02:22:33,995
You think they asked me for permission?

1550
02:22:34,070 --> 02:22:37,335
It's a standard courtesy
to distinguished visitors.

1551
02:22:37,406 --> 02:22:39,237
We are great bell-ringers here.

1552
02:22:39,308 --> 02:22:40,605
But this visitor...

1553
02:22:40,676 --> 02:22:44,544
Dr. Seyss-lnquart ordered it
as a friendly gesture.

1554
02:22:44,881 --> 02:22:49,045
He was Interim Chancellor
and is now Hitler's High Commissioner.

1555
02:22:49,418 --> 02:22:52,546
A very devout Catholic. A war hero.

1556
02:22:52,889 --> 02:22:54,720
- Some tea?
- Thank you.

1557
02:22:55,291 --> 02:22:57,759
You understand
I'm not speaking for myself...

1558
02:22:57,827 --> 02:22:59,886
- but for the Holy See.
- Naturally.

1559
02:22:59,996 --> 02:23:01,156
Drop of rum in it?

1560
02:23:01,230 --> 02:23:03,596
- I don't think I'd...
- Just a taste.

1561
02:23:04,333 --> 02:23:06,301
- Sugar?
- Nothing, thank you.

1562
02:23:06,636 --> 02:23:08,536
What disturbed the Vatican most...

1563
02:23:08,604 --> 02:23:12,096
was the declaration urging
people to vote "Yes" in the plebiscite.

1564
02:23:12,175 --> 02:23:13,574
I understand.

1565
02:23:13,643 --> 02:23:17,579
You mustn't leave here
without tasting this strudel.

1566
02:23:17,647 --> 02:23:19,774
I ordered it for you because I know...

1567
02:23:19,849 --> 02:23:23,250
that you Americans
are mostly interested in strudel...

1568
02:23:23,553 --> 02:23:25,817
when you come to Vienna.

1569
02:23:26,322 --> 02:23:29,155
My only concern, of course,
was the Church.

1570
02:23:29,225 --> 02:23:31,455
I've nothing to do with politics.

1571
02:23:31,527 --> 02:23:35,258
- That statement was non-political?
- Quite so.

1572
02:23:35,331 --> 02:23:38,300
On a vote whether Austria
should become part of Germany?

1573
02:23:38,367 --> 02:23:41,598
Austria is part of Germany.
Hitler announced it.

1574
02:23:42,338 --> 02:23:44,272
The plebiscite is a mere formality.

1575
02:23:44,340 --> 02:23:48,003
A formality that Hitler himself
seems to consider very important.

1576
02:23:48,077 --> 02:23:52,411
Precisely. Hitler wants Austria.
A great many Austrians want Hitler.

1577
02:23:53,115 --> 02:23:57,711
If the Church presides at the marriage,
we'll get better treatment than if it didn't.

1578
02:23:57,920 --> 02:24:02,482
But you're doing more than presiding.
You've come out in favor of the union.

1579
02:24:02,558 --> 02:24:05,994
Rome feels the Church
will be stronger in the long run...

1580
02:24:06,062 --> 02:24:09,498
if we take a more critical stand
toward National Socialism...

1581
02:24:09,565 --> 02:24:11,533
than you have taken so far.

1582
02:24:11,601 --> 02:24:15,537
Does Rome have any idea
how Hitler responds to criticism?

1583
02:24:16,239 --> 02:24:19,902
Would you like to see Catholic men
and women scrubbing the sidewalks...

1584
02:24:19,976 --> 02:24:21,307
like so many Jews?

1585
02:24:21,377 --> 02:24:24,039
There are principles
we cannot compromise.

1586
02:24:24,113 --> 02:24:27,640
The rights of the Church over family life,
education of our youth.

1587
02:24:27,717 --> 02:24:30,686
Your Excellency, what do you think
I'm doing here?

1588
02:24:31,153 --> 02:24:33,383
Protecting those very rights.

1589
02:24:34,023 --> 02:24:38,357
I have been given personal assurances
from the very highest sources.

1590
02:24:38,427 --> 02:24:40,861
We have to remember
what happened in Germany.

1591
02:24:40,930 --> 02:24:45,299
Austria is a different matter.
Don't forget this is a Catholic country.

1592
02:24:46,135 --> 02:24:49,263
It's the country where
he himself was born and baptized.

1593
02:24:49,405 --> 02:24:52,533
- Nevertheless, the Vatican feels...
- You see, Fermoyle...

1594
02:24:52,708 --> 02:24:55,370
I know the people who've taken over here.

1595
02:24:55,645 --> 02:24:59,877
You'll meet some
at Dr. Seyss-lnquart's reception tonight.

1596
02:25:01,117 --> 02:25:04,917
We have a civilized tradition in Austria
that the Germans don't have.

1597
02:25:04,987 --> 02:25:08,150
Then why are people here so anxious
to be annexed by them?

1598
02:25:08,224 --> 02:25:10,385
Because our blood is German.

1599
02:25:11,193 --> 02:25:15,653
It's hard for a non-German to understand.
Hardest of all for an American.

1600
02:25:15,798 --> 02:25:17,129
Why do you say that?

1601
02:25:17,199 --> 02:25:19,565
You are used to so much mixture.

1602
02:25:20,836 --> 02:25:24,135
The joining together
of all German people is...

1603
02:25:24,206 --> 02:25:27,539
what we have been dreaming of
for 1,000 years.

1604
02:25:28,277 --> 02:25:31,678
The Germans and we are different
in many ways, yes.

1605
02:25:32,315 --> 02:25:34,476
But our blood is the same.

1606
02:25:34,550 --> 02:25:37,986
I agree with Your Eminence
that it's a hard concept to understand.

1607
02:25:38,054 --> 02:25:40,488
Then why waste our time trying?

1608
02:25:40,556 --> 02:25:44,788
Why don't you tell me, in brief,
what it is the Holy Father expects of me?

1609
02:25:45,261 --> 02:25:48,355
First, he would like you to make it clear...

1610
02:25:48,431 --> 02:25:52,128
that your recommendation to vote "Yes"
was purely personal...

1611
02:25:52,201 --> 02:25:55,170
not binding on Catholics
as a matter of conscience.

1612
02:25:55,304 --> 02:25:59,400
And once that is done, to issue
no further statements on the plebiscite.

1613
02:25:59,942 --> 02:26:02,376
Very simple instructions to obey.

1614
02:26:02,678 --> 02:26:05,238
I have no desire
to make election statements.

1615
02:26:05,981 --> 02:26:07,812
I'm not a politician.

1616
02:26:14,223 --> 02:26:18,956
Your Eminence, Theodor Cardinal Innitzer
and your Excellency, Bishop Fermoyle.

1617
02:26:23,933 --> 02:26:28,165
General Albrecht Kraus. Bishop Fermoyle.

1618
02:26:28,738 --> 02:26:31,673
Frau Walter, may I introduce you
to Bishop Fermoyle?

1619
02:26:31,741 --> 02:26:35,074
Frau Clara Walter. Dr. Seyss-lnquart.

1620
02:26:35,644 --> 02:26:38,044
Your Eminence.

1621
02:26:38,114 --> 02:26:41,106
This is His Excellency Bishop Fermoyle.

1622
02:26:41,183 --> 02:26:43,777
An American who works in the Vatican.

1623
02:26:43,853 --> 02:26:45,218
I am honored.

1624
02:26:45,287 --> 02:26:49,747
I do hope you tell His Holiness
how we esteem His Eminence here.

1625
02:26:50,693 --> 02:26:53,890
I spoke today on the telephone
with the Führer.

1626
02:26:53,963 --> 02:26:55,362
And he said:

1627
02:26:55,431 --> 02:26:58,832
"All Austria must be at your command,
my dear Seyss-lnquart...

1628
02:26:58,934 --> 02:27:01,061
"except Cardinal Innitzer."

1629
02:27:01,437 --> 02:27:05,203
He said, "Remember,
your authority you have from me...

1630
02:27:05,941 --> 02:27:07,636
"his is from God."

1631
02:27:07,810 --> 02:27:11,712
Herr Kurt von Hartman
and Frau Annemarie von Hartman.

1632
02:27:13,416 --> 02:27:15,441
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

1633
02:27:24,894 --> 02:27:27,556
I finally did make my trip to America.

1634
02:27:28,164 --> 02:27:31,224
Kurt went on business two years ago
and took me along.

1635
02:27:31,667 --> 02:27:33,635
But we never saw Boston.

1636
02:27:33,702 --> 02:27:37,604
I'm afraid most people don't.
How did you like what you did see?

1637
02:27:37,673 --> 02:27:39,868
Very much. Most of it.

1638
02:27:39,942 --> 02:27:44,345
There were things our people should have
here to bring them into modern times.

1639
02:27:44,914 --> 02:27:47,178
Now, I think we will begin to get them.

1640
02:27:47,249 --> 02:27:48,944
Because of Hitler?

1641
02:27:49,118 --> 02:27:51,279
Annemarie finds merits in Mr. Hitler...

1642
02:27:51,353 --> 02:27:54,186
not apparent to more detached observers.

1643
02:27:54,356 --> 02:27:55,721
But you don't agree?

1644
02:27:55,791 --> 02:27:58,817
As a banker,
I have to know some economics...

1645
02:27:59,261 --> 02:28:03,960
You have to go up about 1,500 meters
to get good snow this late.

1646
02:28:04,834 --> 02:28:06,597
The Zugspitze.

1647
02:28:07,303 --> 02:28:10,704
St. Christopher above Adelberg...

1648
02:28:10,773 --> 02:28:13,606
This is getting to be
a persecution complex.

1649
02:28:13,676 --> 02:28:17,077
Not to speak in front of Reinhard,
who's been with us 12 years.

1650
02:28:17,146 --> 02:28:19,706
I believe the best rule
is to make no exceptions.

1651
02:28:19,782 --> 02:28:22,546
The great danger about the Nazis,
I believe...

1652
02:28:22,618 --> 02:28:26,520
is they must keep expanding or collapse.
Sooner or later this means war.

1653
02:28:26,589 --> 02:28:29,524
He says peace is
the great dream of his life.

1654
02:28:29,592 --> 02:28:33,187
While he builds tanks and planes
and surrounds himself with gangsters.

1655
02:28:33,262 --> 02:28:37,426
Some of them are crude, I know.
But I think we need their strength.

1656
02:28:37,900 --> 02:28:41,301
Now we have become part
of a great, powerful country.

1657
02:28:42,505 --> 02:28:44,496
- Who could it be?
- I don't know.

1658
02:28:46,175 --> 02:28:47,073
Excuse me.

1659
02:28:55,618 --> 02:28:57,017
Gestapo!

1660
02:28:59,255 --> 02:29:00,415
Excuse me.

1661
02:29:08,430 --> 02:29:09,556
Kurt!

1662
02:30:10,025 --> 02:30:12,084
Do you know why he did it?

1663
02:30:13,429 --> 02:30:16,523
His grandmother
on his father's side was Jewish.

1664
02:30:17,032 --> 02:30:18,522
The Nazis knew.

1665
02:30:19,001 --> 02:30:22,198
Apparently, he was
half out of his mind with fear.

1666
02:30:22,605 --> 02:30:25,597
He couldn't decide whether
to get out of the country or what.

1667
02:30:25,674 --> 02:30:28,700
He discussed all this with his lawyer,
but he never told me.

1668
02:30:28,777 --> 02:30:31,610
- How would you have reacted?
- I'm not sure.

1669
02:30:31,714 --> 02:30:33,511
Perhaps he wasn't either.

1670
02:30:33,582 --> 02:30:37,348
It wasn't fair of him not to tell me.
How could I help him if I didn't know?

1671
02:30:37,419 --> 02:30:39,410
He must have been desperate.

1672
02:30:39,788 --> 02:30:42,450
You don't think what he did
was right, do you?

1673
02:30:42,558 --> 02:30:44,958
Nothing ever can justify suicide.

1674
02:30:45,561 --> 02:30:48,291
But some cases are easier to understand.

1675
02:30:48,831 --> 02:30:53,063
The mental condition of people who feel
persecuted becomes distorted...

1676
02:30:53,435 --> 02:30:56,996
and nothing they do is understandable
to the normal mind.

1677
02:31:10,486 --> 02:31:11,953
Your Eminence.

1678
02:31:14,223 --> 02:31:18,489
Forgive me for breaking in on you like this,
but I was at the opera...

1679
02:31:18,727 --> 02:31:22,754
and it occurred to me you'd want
to read this at the earliest opportunity.

1680
02:31:23,632 --> 02:31:27,500
The correction you asked for
of our statement on the plebiscite.

1681
02:31:27,569 --> 02:31:30,732
You'll probably want
to send it on to the Vatican.

1682
02:31:30,806 --> 02:31:34,071
I think you'll find it covers
all the points we discussed.

1683
02:31:34,143 --> 02:31:37,442
- When will this be published?
- Is Your Excellency joking?

1684
02:31:37,513 --> 02:31:41,472
The Nazis aren't going to let anything
be printed that will lose them votes.

1685
02:31:41,550 --> 02:31:45,213
I suggest you have it read in every church
in the country, Sunday morning.

1686
02:31:45,287 --> 02:31:47,278
That's the day of the plebiscite.

1687
02:31:47,356 --> 02:31:50,052
Won't many people go to Mass
before they vote?

1688
02:31:50,125 --> 02:31:53,652
- It might cause disturbances.
- Then you reject the idea?

1689
02:31:53,962 --> 02:31:58,365
Unless I get a direct order from
the Vatican. That, I'd naturally obey...

1690
02:31:58,434 --> 02:32:00,925
even if I thought it was imprudent.

1691
02:32:01,103 --> 02:32:02,900
Good night, Bishop Fermoyle.

1692
02:32:02,971 --> 02:32:06,498
Don't bother to show me out.
I can see how busy you are.

1693
02:32:06,709 --> 02:32:10,645
We're getting the papers from Archbishop
Cicognani's regime ready for shipment.

1694
02:32:10,813 --> 02:32:15,079
Reminding me that we'll soon have
no direct voice of Rome at our side.

1695
02:32:16,351 --> 02:32:17,682
Good night.

1696
02:32:19,688 --> 02:32:22,748
While His Eminence was here,
this lady came.

1697
02:32:24,760 --> 02:32:28,719
I wouldn't have come here,
but I didn't know where else to turn.

1698
02:32:35,037 --> 02:32:36,664
What's happening?

1699
02:32:37,106 --> 02:32:39,597
They are following me, the Gestapo.

1700
02:32:40,309 --> 02:32:44,575
I think they followed me here.
I don't know what they're after, but...

1701
02:32:45,314 --> 02:32:49,717
if they take me to prison, they can make
me say anything they want to, can't they?

1702
02:32:50,686 --> 02:32:52,586
With drugs and torture.

1703
02:32:54,456 --> 02:32:57,152
I don't think I could stand much pain.

1704
02:32:57,226 --> 02:33:00,855
- I don't know what to do, where to go.
- You can stay here.

1705
02:33:04,433 --> 02:33:07,630
Father Neidermoser?
Is Sister Wilhelmina still up?

1706
02:33:07,703 --> 02:33:10,638
- I believe so.
- Please ask her to come here.

1707
02:33:12,975 --> 02:33:14,875
You'll be safe with us.

1708
02:33:15,010 --> 02:33:18,537
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be. I'm glad I can be of help to you.

1709
02:33:20,249 --> 02:33:21,580
Thank you.

1710
02:33:22,317 --> 02:33:23,545
Come in.

1711
02:33:28,490 --> 02:33:31,288
- You sent for me, Your Excellency?
- Yes, Sister.

1712
02:33:31,360 --> 02:33:34,124
I want you to prepare a room
for Frau von Hartman.

1713
02:33:34,530 --> 02:33:35,519
Certainly.

1714
02:33:35,597 --> 02:33:38,896
Sister Wilhelmina will see to it
that you have everything you need.

1715
02:33:38,967 --> 02:33:41,663
Will you come with me,
Frau von Hartman?

1716
02:33:42,204 --> 02:33:43,831
Thank you again.

1717
02:33:47,176 --> 02:33:50,668
Your Eminence must have been
among the first voters this morning.

1718
02:33:50,746 --> 02:33:52,873
The news was on the radio at 9:00.

1719
02:33:52,948 --> 02:33:56,384
I'm an earlier riser.
I like to say Mass at 6:00.

1720
02:33:56,585 --> 02:33:58,883
You advertised how you had voted.

1721
02:33:58,954 --> 02:34:01,650
I reported to you
the Holy Father's concern for the...

1722
02:34:01,723 --> 02:34:05,955
My dear Bishop, you said I was to issue
no more statements on the plebiscite.

1723
02:34:06,028 --> 02:34:10,260
Last night, at the end of Hitler's campaign
speech, all the church bells rang again.

1724
02:34:10,332 --> 02:34:12,892
You just won't understand about the bells.

1725
02:34:12,968 --> 02:34:15,766
What would attract attention
is not to ring them.

1726
02:34:15,904 --> 02:34:20,500
Radio reports say that priests all over the
country are urging people to vote "Yes."

1727
02:34:20,642 --> 02:34:23,270
And the big news is
that after you cast your vote...

1728
02:34:23,345 --> 02:34:25,245
My purely personal vote.

1729
02:34:25,514 --> 02:34:28,108
You gave the Nazi salute, Heil Hitler.

1730
02:34:28,183 --> 02:34:32,415
That is correct. The words have become
a part of the German language.

1731
02:34:32,588 --> 02:34:35,853
They are used instead of "good morning"
or "good evening"...

1732
02:34:35,924 --> 02:34:38,791
even, I regret to say,
instead of "God bless you."

1733
02:34:38,961 --> 02:34:43,398
Still, under the circumstances,
that salute was a partisan political act.

1734
02:34:43,632 --> 02:34:47,932
I was not issuing a statement.
I have not disobeyed the Holy Father.

1735
02:34:48,537 --> 02:34:50,334
Literally, maybe not.

1736
02:34:51,773 --> 02:34:56,506
What I tried to convey to Your Eminence
was a spirit, a general attitude.

1737
02:34:57,112 --> 02:35:00,172
To that you obviously paid
no attention at all.

1738
02:35:00,449 --> 02:35:04,886
You deliberately decided that your way
was better than the Holy Father's.

1739
02:35:05,153 --> 02:35:08,145
That's how I see it,
and that's how I'll have to report it.

1740
02:35:08,223 --> 02:35:09,952
One moment, Bishop.

1741
02:35:10,459 --> 02:35:14,793
You must understand that I have no wish
to pry into your personal life.

1742
02:35:17,132 --> 02:35:20,033
That was taken
at Kurt von Hartman's funeral.

1743
02:35:21,236 --> 02:35:24,637
May I ask how Your Eminence
happens to have come by this picture?

1744
02:35:24,706 --> 02:35:26,697
The police gave it to me.

1745
02:35:27,609 --> 02:35:30,305
I knew Frau von Hartman
before she was married.

1746
02:35:30,379 --> 02:35:33,678
I was here at the time during
a leave of absence from priesthood.

1747
02:35:33,749 --> 02:35:35,216
A leave of absence?

1748
02:35:35,384 --> 02:35:39,184
My vows naturally remained in force.
That was many years ago.

1749
02:35:39,454 --> 02:35:43,220
And right now, this very same woman
is living with you at the nunciature?

1750
02:35:43,292 --> 02:35:45,988
She's staying with Sister Wilhelmina,
the housekeeper.

1751
02:35:46,061 --> 02:35:48,996
I don't suggest
there's anything improper about it.

1752
02:35:49,064 --> 02:35:52,124
But you must appreciate
what the Nazis might make of it.

1753
02:35:52,200 --> 02:35:54,464
I granted Frau von Hartman sanctuary.

1754
02:35:54,536 --> 02:35:56,197
From the police, I know.

1755
02:35:56,271 --> 02:35:59,707
But does the fact that the police claim
she has committed a crime...

1756
02:35:59,775 --> 02:36:03,074
make the propaganda image
any more favorable to the Church?

1757
02:36:03,145 --> 02:36:07,013
She has not committed a crime.
Nobody has charged her with anything.

1758
02:36:07,082 --> 02:36:09,710
I'd better bring you up to date on that.

1759
02:36:10,052 --> 02:36:13,146
There is clear evidence
that Kurt von Hartman...

1760
02:36:13,221 --> 02:36:16,850
for understandable reasons,
was planning to leave Austria.

1761
02:36:16,959 --> 02:36:18,859
That may be true, but it hardly...

1762
02:36:18,927 --> 02:36:21,657
He wanted to take
a large sum of money with him.

1763
02:36:21,730 --> 02:36:25,860
That's been against the law for years,
long before the Nazis came.

1764
02:36:26,168 --> 02:36:28,432
This in no way involves his wife.

1765
02:36:28,503 --> 02:36:31,267
The fact that her personal jewelry
was included.

1766
02:36:31,340 --> 02:36:32,898
Included in what?

1767
02:36:33,041 --> 02:36:37,603
Sewn, with the money, into the lining
of a suitcase found in the apartment.

1768
02:36:38,547 --> 02:36:41,641
- I didn't know about that.
- She didn't tell you.

1769
02:36:41,750 --> 02:36:45,117
She told me that she knew nothing
about her husband's plans.

1770
02:36:45,253 --> 02:36:48,848
And you accepted that.
I suppose it might even be true.

1771
02:36:48,991 --> 02:36:54,327
If it is, she should want the investigation
to proceed so her name can be cleared.

1772
02:36:54,730 --> 02:36:57,665
Simply tell her to cooperate
with the authorities.

1773
02:36:57,733 --> 02:37:01,897
- When the authorities are the Gestapo...
- I cannot have this scandal.

1774
02:37:02,738 --> 02:37:05,206
Not at a moment when I am completing...

1775
02:37:05,273 --> 02:37:09,471
the most delicate negotiations
for the future of the Church in Austria.

1776
02:37:09,544 --> 02:37:12,911
I have to think about it.
I have to talk to Frau von Hartman.

1777
02:37:12,981 --> 02:37:16,542
But you appreciate the importance
of the problem and the urgency?

1778
02:37:16,852 --> 02:37:21,551
You'll find a way that won't embarrass me
or my relations with the new government?

1779
02:37:22,024 --> 02:37:24,049
Yes, I will find a way.

1780
02:37:36,905 --> 02:37:39,465
They've just reported
the totals of the plebiscite.

1781
02:37:39,541 --> 02:37:42,101
11,807 "No" votes.

1782
02:37:42,477 --> 02:37:46,277
4,443,208 "Yes" votes.

1783
02:37:46,681 --> 02:37:50,777
The percentage of "Yes" votes was 99.73.

1784
02:37:50,852 --> 02:37:52,513
Thank you, Father.

1785
02:37:52,754 --> 02:37:54,984
99 and 3/4 percent majority.

1786
02:37:55,791 --> 02:38:00,490
There's a soap in America that's
advertised as 99.44 percent pure.

1787
02:38:00,996 --> 02:38:03,396
But Hitler has to be even purer.

1788
02:38:03,698 --> 02:38:07,065
- You'll close the nunciature.
- Austria doesn't exist anymore.

1789
02:38:07,569 --> 02:38:11,403
Our diplomatic relations are
with Germany, with the nuncio in Berlin.

1790
02:38:13,408 --> 02:38:17,208
The Gestapo said they found
a suitcase hidden in your apartment.

1791
02:38:17,712 --> 02:38:21,079
Jewelry of yours was sewn
into the lining along with cash.

1792
02:38:21,216 --> 02:38:23,582
Kurt always kept my jewelry in his safe.

1793
02:38:23,652 --> 02:38:26,348
I'll find a way to get you
out of the country.

1794
02:38:26,421 --> 02:38:28,616
You don't owe me anything, Stephen.

1795
02:38:28,690 --> 02:38:30,590
I owe you a great deal.

1796
02:38:30,692 --> 02:38:34,628
At a time when I'd forgotten how to love,
you helped me to love again.

1797
02:38:34,696 --> 02:38:37,597
And you gave that love,
not to me, but to God.

1798
02:38:38,233 --> 02:38:41,168
It was his to begin with, it was always his.

1799
02:38:41,570 --> 02:38:43,561
For me it was always you.

1800
02:38:44,272 --> 02:38:46,399
I never loved another man but you.

1801
02:38:48,110 --> 02:38:51,807
Excuse me, Your Excellency, telephone.

1802
02:39:05,460 --> 02:39:08,657
I want a Vatican witness
along with me tonight.

1803
02:39:09,097 --> 02:39:13,727
Not only to keep the record straight,
but it should be an educational experience.

1804
02:39:14,669 --> 02:39:19,129
I want you to report that a non-Roman
can practice successful diplomacy.

1805
02:39:20,142 --> 02:39:23,009
- Where are we going?
- To see Adolf Hitler.

1806
02:39:29,584 --> 02:39:32,917
We've been waiting more than two hours.
Does the Führer know this?

1807
02:39:32,988 --> 02:39:37,482
- I'm sure he knows, Your Eminence.
- Thank you.

1808
02:39:43,064 --> 02:39:46,158
Two hours is a bit long,
no matter how busy he is...

1809
02:39:46,234 --> 02:39:48,759
but at least we should find him
in a good mood.

1810
02:39:48,837 --> 02:39:51,032
Austria is his greatest triumph yet.

1811
02:39:51,106 --> 02:39:53,267
Cardinal Innitzer.

1812
02:39:54,843 --> 02:39:56,174
Not Bishop Fermoyle.

1813
02:39:56,912 --> 02:40:00,712
- The Führer wants to speak to you alone.
- But I specifically asked...

1814
02:40:00,782 --> 02:40:02,909
The Führer gave these orders.

1815
02:40:20,702 --> 02:40:23,296
Excuse me, Your Excellency.

1816
02:40:23,371 --> 02:40:27,330
You will tell people when you are home
in America, about these days of glory...

1817
02:40:27,409 --> 02:40:30,742
how you saw two German countries
peacefully reunited.

1818
02:40:31,680 --> 02:40:33,409
I will tell people what I saw.

1819
02:40:33,481 --> 02:40:36,245
It will be the same
when we free our German brothers...

1820
02:40:36,318 --> 02:40:38,548
in the Sudetenland of Czechoslovakia.

1821
02:40:38,620 --> 02:40:40,611
And also in your country.

1822
02:40:40,755 --> 02:40:43,747
- You're talking about the United States?
- Yes.

1823
02:40:44,326 --> 02:40:47,386
We have no wish to conquer your land
or harm your people.

1824
02:40:47,462 --> 02:40:50,954
Our only purpose is to liberate
the five million Germans there.

1825
02:40:54,436 --> 02:40:56,996
Your friend must have said
something wrong.

1826
02:41:20,262 --> 02:41:23,720
He repudiated all his promises to me,
every one of them.

1827
02:41:24,499 --> 02:41:26,592
There is going to be a war, he says.

1828
02:41:26,668 --> 02:41:29,762
The Church must be drafted
into the service of the Fatherland...

1829
02:41:29,838 --> 02:41:31,635
the same as the Army.

1830
02:41:32,007 --> 02:41:35,465
In Austria, there must be
even more control than in Germany...

1831
02:41:35,543 --> 02:41:38,341
because we have such a Catholic majority.

1832
02:41:39,848 --> 02:41:44,285
Our schools are to be abolished.
Our youth groups dissolved.

1833
02:41:45,153 --> 02:41:48,850
Catholic marriage will no longer have
the force of law.

1834
02:41:49,257 --> 02:41:51,555
At the very end, he started yelling...

1835
02:41:51,826 --> 02:41:54,920
and asked me if I didn't think
Almighty God...

1836
02:41:55,330 --> 02:41:58,959
had chosen him to lead
the German people to their destiny.

1837
02:42:00,235 --> 02:42:02,328
He didn't wait for an answer.

1838
02:42:02,404 --> 02:42:05,237
And I remembered myself
at the plebiscite...

1839
02:42:06,308 --> 02:42:08,936
raising my hand in a heathen salute...

1840
02:42:09,577 --> 02:42:13,775
and saying not, "Praise to the Lord,"
but "Heil Hitler."

1841
02:48:08,936 --> 02:48:11,461
We could save the Blessed Sacrament.

1842
02:48:52,080 --> 02:48:56,176
It leads to the crypt under the cathedral.

1843
02:49:29,951 --> 02:49:31,213
Eminence!

1844
02:49:31,786 --> 02:49:33,913
Oh, no. It's only a scratch.

1845
02:49:34,088 --> 02:49:35,783
We must get you out of here.

1846
02:49:35,857 --> 02:49:39,953
With a Vatican passport, you are one of
the few people who can leave the country.

1847
02:49:40,027 --> 02:49:44,293
At least for the moment. You must
tell the truth about Hitler's promises.

1848
02:49:44,365 --> 02:49:46,925
You can't stay here, Your Eminence.
You're not safe.

1849
02:49:47,001 --> 02:49:51,267
Safety, I'm afraid, is among the illusions
we can no longer depend on.

1850
02:49:51,706 --> 02:49:53,105
Pray for me.

1851
02:50:59,140 --> 02:51:02,234
Your Excellency,
the most extraordinary thing...

1852
02:51:02,743 --> 02:51:04,074
Frau von Hartman.

1853
02:51:04,145 --> 02:51:08,445
The Gestapo came to question her. I told
them they'd no right to enter the building.

1854
02:51:08,516 --> 02:51:11,246
- That it's the soil of a sovereign power.
- What happened?

1855
02:51:11,319 --> 02:51:13,549
Frau von Hartman
went outside to meet them.

1856
02:51:13,621 --> 02:51:16,283
She didn't wish to claim
the right of asylum here.

1857
02:51:16,357 --> 02:51:19,224
I begged her to wait till
Your Excellency returned, but...

1858
02:51:19,293 --> 02:51:20,521
She wouldn't?

1859
02:51:20,595 --> 02:51:24,395
Frau von Hartman said
her character was barely strong enough...

1860
02:51:24,565 --> 02:51:26,430
to do what she was doing right then.

1861
02:51:26,500 --> 02:51:29,833
It wouldn't hold up
if she had to talk to you about it.

1862
02:51:37,612 --> 02:51:38,704
Open up!

1863
02:51:54,595 --> 02:51:58,497
I couldn't believe it, Your Excellency,
when they told me who was here.

1864
02:51:58,566 --> 02:52:00,227
Why did you let them take you?

1865
02:52:00,301 --> 02:52:03,270
Because it suddenly seemed easier
not to fight them.

1866
02:52:03,371 --> 02:52:05,032
It just didn't matter anymore.

1867
02:52:05,106 --> 02:52:08,166
It matters a lot.
We both know you're innocent.

1868
02:52:08,242 --> 02:52:13,043
Of one thing, to escape from Austria with
money and jewels. I'm innocent of that.

1869
02:52:13,514 --> 02:52:17,917
And with the right help, you may prove it.
I have a lawyer coming to see you.

1870
02:52:18,119 --> 02:52:20,713
Is it worth so much effort? I wonder.

1871
02:52:22,290 --> 02:52:25,657
I've had time to think about myself
since Kurt died.

1872
02:52:27,728 --> 02:52:31,357
When I was a spoiled girl,
I fell in love with a young man.

1873
02:52:32,533 --> 02:52:33,795
A priest.

1874
02:52:34,802 --> 02:52:37,635
I loved him. At least, I think I loved him.

1875
02:52:37,772 --> 02:52:40,263
But he was also a challenge to my vanity.

1876
02:52:40,474 --> 02:52:43,136
I wanted to take him away
from his priesthood.

1877
02:52:43,244 --> 02:52:45,542
I wanted to take him away from God.

1878
02:52:45,680 --> 02:52:49,309
- You're not allowing us much time.
- No, let me speak please.

1879
02:52:50,051 --> 02:52:53,487
When I lost that campaign,
I was disappointed...

1880
02:52:54,488 --> 02:52:57,787
and I turned to Kurt,
which might have been all right...

1881
02:52:58,426 --> 02:53:02,658
if I had been able to make myself, for him,
the wife I used to dream about.

1882
02:53:04,065 --> 02:53:06,659
A woman who existed only for her man.

1883
02:53:08,202 --> 02:53:09,533
Poor Kurt.

1884
02:53:09,971 --> 02:53:14,465
He would have been satisfied with less,
much less, but I gave him nothing.

1885
02:53:14,809 --> 02:53:16,902
- Annemarie...
- Let me finish.

1886
02:53:18,612 --> 02:53:21,479
Even when two people
have very little to share...

1887
02:53:21,549 --> 02:53:25,041
it is possible for them to make
some sort of a life together.

1888
02:53:26,654 --> 02:53:31,523
Until one of them has
a very strong need of the other.

1889
02:53:33,828 --> 02:53:37,662
When Kurt felt such a need,
there was nowhere for him to turn.

1890
02:53:38,733 --> 02:53:41,759
He loved me too much
to leave the country without me...

1891
02:53:41,836 --> 02:53:45,567
and he couldn't be sure enough of me
to tell me about his plan.

1892
02:53:46,707 --> 02:53:48,902
I can imagine what he felt...

1893
02:53:48,976 --> 02:53:52,309
when he heard my foolish talk about
the new Greater Germany.

1894
02:53:52,913 --> 02:53:56,041
Because of that alone,
it serves me right that I'm here now.

1895
02:53:56,117 --> 02:53:58,244
Do you think Kurt would feel that way?

1896
02:53:58,319 --> 02:53:59,411
No.

1897
02:54:00,054 --> 02:54:03,251
He was too kind.
He would not want to see me hurt.

1898
02:54:03,324 --> 02:54:06,816
Then that's one reason to try
to clear yourself, for his sake.

1899
02:54:07,128 --> 02:54:10,393
Also for mine,
because I care what happens to you.

1900
02:54:12,033 --> 02:54:14,001
Thank you. I wish I did.

1901
02:54:14,335 --> 02:54:16,530
Let's wrap it up! Your time is up.

1902
02:54:17,938 --> 02:54:22,102
You have to. The most important reason
of all is for your own sake.

1903
02:54:22,743 --> 02:54:24,711
Because of what you are.

1904
02:54:25,446 --> 02:54:28,904
Not an ant in a totalitarian anthill...

1905
02:54:29,583 --> 02:54:31,983
but a human being, an individual...

1906
02:54:32,053 --> 02:54:34,146
with a God-given soul of your own.

1907
02:54:34,221 --> 02:54:35,552
Come.

1908
02:54:37,691 --> 02:54:39,784
Thank you, Your Excellency.

1909
02:54:40,795 --> 02:54:42,194
And goodbye.

1910
02:54:54,742 --> 02:54:57,438
I have the honor to inform
Your Eminence...

1911
02:54:57,511 --> 02:55:00,742
that the Holy Father will confer
the cardinal's biretta...

1912
02:55:00,848 --> 02:55:04,614
at the semipublic consistory
in the Apostolic Palace of the Vatican...

1913
02:55:04,919 --> 02:55:06,944
Thursday morning, at 10:00.

1914
02:55:07,021 --> 02:55:08,352
Thank you.

1915
02:55:11,225 --> 02:55:12,692
My friends...

1916
02:55:13,427 --> 02:55:15,486
dear brethren in Christ...

1917
02:55:16,230 --> 02:55:17,629
my mother...

1918
02:55:17,965 --> 02:55:22,698
and the other members of my family,
who have traveled so far for this occasion.

1919
02:55:23,304 --> 02:55:25,602
I thank you all for being here.

1920
02:55:26,474 --> 02:55:29,841
And I know you share my gratitude
to the Holy Father...

1921
02:55:30,845 --> 02:55:34,747
for the honor he has done to me
and to America.

1922
02:55:37,051 --> 02:55:40,509
When His Holiness informed me
that he intended to name me...

1923
02:55:40,588 --> 02:55:43,022
to the Sacred College of Cardinals...

1924
02:55:44,692 --> 02:55:49,095
my first reaction was that
I could not live up to his confidence in me.

1925
02:55:51,599 --> 02:55:55,763
I haven't gotten over that fear yet.
I doubt that I ever will.

1926
02:55:57,304 --> 02:56:01,434
But the second thought I had about it
gave me the strength to try.

1927
02:56:02,943 --> 02:56:06,845
What occurred to me was
that there is a special significance...

1928
02:56:07,681 --> 02:56:11,617
in the Holy Father's decision
to send me back to my own country...

1929
02:56:11,685 --> 02:56:13,983
as a cardinal and archbishop...

1930
02:56:15,356 --> 02:56:17,688
at this moment of global crisis.

1931
02:56:19,827 --> 02:56:22,523
America's first bishop, John Carroll...

1932
02:56:23,597 --> 02:56:27,624
was the brother of a signer
of the Declaration of Independence...

1933
02:56:28,602 --> 02:56:30,502
and a living example...

1934
02:56:31,205 --> 02:56:33,833
of that loyalty to church and state...

1935
02:56:35,476 --> 02:56:37,774
to religion and to democracy...

1936
02:56:39,013 --> 02:56:42,107
that this moment in history
demands from us all.

1937
02:56:44,285 --> 02:56:46,480
I have seen at close range...

1938
02:56:47,888 --> 02:56:51,949
the hell on earth that awaits us all
if totalitarianism prevails.

1939
02:56:54,094 --> 02:56:58,326
If the world forgets that all men alike
are the children of God...

1940
02:56:59,667 --> 02:57:01,760
endowed by their Creator...

1941
02:57:02,303 --> 02:57:04,498
with the unalienable right...

1942
02:57:04,572 --> 02:57:05,903
to life...

1943
02:57:05,973 --> 02:57:07,270
liberty...

1944
02:57:07,341 --> 02:57:09,536
and the pursuit of happiness.

1945
02:57:10,110 --> 02:57:13,739
That is America's creed.
That is the Gospel of the Church.

1946
02:57:15,849 --> 02:57:19,114
It is in danger, at this moment,
from men...

1947
02:57:20,020 --> 02:57:23,387
and doctrines that are
the enemies of all freedoms...

1948
02:57:24,425 --> 02:57:26,757
political, as well as religious.

1949
02:57:28,996 --> 02:57:32,159
The defense of freedom
calls for strong voices...

1950
02:57:33,667 --> 02:57:35,259
strong hearts...

1951
02:57:36,370 --> 02:57:37,837
strong hands.

1952
02:57:41,375 --> 02:57:44,242
Pray for me, that I may not falter...

1953
02:57:46,247 --> 02:57:49,444
and for the liberty and exaltation
of our church...

1954
02:57:51,352 --> 02:57:52,683
and our beloved country.

1955
02:57:55,723 --> 02:57:57,213
God bless you.
