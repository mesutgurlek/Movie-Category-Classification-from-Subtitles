1
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:57,031
FOREST OF THE GODS

2
00:00:57,880 --> 00:01:01,873
Once famous for its
decorative Baroque style

3
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,913
Under the motives of Balys Sruoga's
novel "Forest of the Gods"

4
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,076
in the middle of the
20th century Germany

5
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:10,873
could boast of its barracks.

6
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,950
To understand the internal state

7
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,038
of a concentration camp resident

8
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,997
we'd have to change our whole thinking.

9
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,070
First of all, common sense needs

10
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,996
to be sent on limitless vacation.

11
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,957
At least for a while

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,911
our mind should be replaced

13
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,953
with the primitive instincts of
starvation, self-preservation.

14
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:41,873
A clear line should be drawn

15
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,951
between a man and a beast,

16
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,076
between life and death.

17
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,916
Mother of God!

18
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,029
What are you doing here?

19
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,913
What are you doing here, sir?!

20
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,995
Maria!

21
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,916
Maria, who's that man?

22
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,877
Maria!

23
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,876
What's going on?

24
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,876
Who, sir, would you be?

25
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,069
Who would you be, sir?

26
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,871
Take your documents, Professor.

27
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,069
You're coming with us.

28
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:42,076
- What documents? - A passport.

29
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,031
It's a misunderstanding.

30
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,035
I'll be right back.

31
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,913
I'll make herring with
hot potatoes for dinner.

32
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,995
Okay.

33
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,871
I'll be right back.

34
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,072
What have you been doing for
the past two weeks, Professor?

35
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:19,030
- The past two weeks, I... - Sit down.

36
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,871
I've been very busy,

37
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,956
I've been translating a play in verse...

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,035
Please sit.

39
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,913
...in verse, in iamb, for the theatre.

40
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,076
I've been also writing a study

41
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,075
on the Renaissance of Florence.

42
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,918
You give lectures at the university.

43
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,951
You should have noticed there were

44
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,992
less and less students
till finally none left.

45
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,951
What are you talking about?

46
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,958
Yesterday I gave a lecture
on the German romanticism

47
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,037
- and there were enough students.
- Enough? - Yes, enough!

48
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,878
Latvians and Estonians responded

49
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,911
to our invitation to mobilize.

50
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,996
But this country?

51
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,996
Two invalids and a lunatic turned up

52
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,996
at the recruitment office.

53
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,951
What theatre is this?

54
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,873
You are popular among the students.

55
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,070
They don't come because
of your influence.

56
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,916
I'm not popular in my country.

57
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,996
I don't read newspapers,

58
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,872
I'm not interested in politics,
I'm just a professor.

59
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,070
If you wish write down I'm a poet as well.

60
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,998
- Yes, a poet. - A poet
can also be dangerous.

61
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,996
How can I be dangerous?

62
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:27,949
How?

63
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:32,030
You give lectures.

64
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:37,955
Your ironic comments,
your nipping remarks.

65
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:41,878
This you know how to do.

66
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,916
Everything happened so quickly.

67
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,872
A trip in a crammed train to Tilsit,

68
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,110
a drive by truck from Tilsit to Gdansk.

69
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,952
Swamp, forest and then

70
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,877
in front of our eyes

71
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:06,878
a sign on the gates of
the concentration camp:

72
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:09,992
"Everyone gets what one deserves".

73
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,077
Attention! Caps on! Caps off!

74
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,871
Attention!

75
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,989
Fresh air.

76
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,991
A resort.

77
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,874
- What do you mean a resort?
- A seaside resort, pine trees.

78
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:09,916
Hello, Lithuanians.

79
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,950
We knew you're coming.

80
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,956
We've been waiting.

81
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,036
And earlier on, we've been waiting

82
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,071
for the Lithuanian sausage.

83
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,995
Pork fat.

84
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,917
You'll put your suitcases
and coats into the cart.

85
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,997
Golden teeth, watches, rings,

86
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,996
all gold

87
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,878
you must give to the Reich.

88
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,911
Have a watch?

89
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,911
Have a watch?

90
00:07:58,040 --> 00:08:00,076
Get in line, you morons.

91
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,108
Faster.

92
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,110
How many of you stinking pigs are there?

93
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,949
A watch?

94
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,070
One. Two. Three.

95
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,990
I said stand still.

96
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,877
Asshole.

97
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:38,912
I'm here to see Commissar Hinkst.

98
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,070
I was at the educational administration.

99
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,996
I was told my husband should be here.

100
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,951
Madame, I can't help you.

101
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,951
Please.

102
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,951
I don't know if he's alive.

103
00:08:57,080 --> 00:08:58,957
When they took the Professor,

104
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,877
they said not for long.

105
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,035
It's been two weeks.

106
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,951
You are the Professor's wife?

107
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:05,989
Yes.

108
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,873
I was his student.

109
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,991
He's safe and sound.

110
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,989
Can I see him?

111
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,033
Unfortunately, the Professor is not
in Lithuania. They took him away.

112
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,957
Took him away? Where?

113
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,992
I don't know. The Gestapo
doesn't give answers.

114
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,951
Forgive me, Madame.

115
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,911
Christ...

116
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:51,917
Sir...

117
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,918
Please look, officer, how
they've dressed me.

118
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,877
See?

119
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,868
Sir, sir officer, sir officer...

120
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,029
Look...

121
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,957
Be kind, could you find anything better?

122
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,958
Christ, just look how
they've dressed me, huh?

123
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,877
Could you find anything?

124
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,036
You think this is a store?
It's a concentration camp,

125
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,071
you fucking dead meat! Mouth!

126
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,956
Do you have golden teeth?

127
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,990
Of what use are you to the Third Reich?

128
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,029
What can you do?

129
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,876
I can write poems.

130
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,991
I can write plays.

131
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,069
I can type.

132
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,997
I could teach theatre history in the camp,

133
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,996
lecture on Stansilavky method...

134
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,952
Shut up, piece of shit.

135
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,989
Mouth!

136
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,070
You don't have golden teeth either?

137
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:00,995
What can you do?

138
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,996
I can build a house.

139
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,991
I can make good beer.

140
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,990
- I can make schnapps. - Schnapps?

141
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:11,958
The entire neighbourhood
knows Tadas' schnapps.

142
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:13,877
Schnapps good.

143
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,989
Yes, good.

144
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,956
You have syphilis?

145
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,911
Mouth!

146
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:26,873
Eh, sure you have syphilis.

147
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,957
What can you do?

148
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,911
I can herd cows.

149
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:36,076
That means nothing. Son of a bitch.

150
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,916
Andrzej Germinski. Polish.

151
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,959
A former boxer. A former
officer of the Polish Army.

152
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,990
Arranged boxing matches in the camp.

153
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,991
Andrzej had an exemplary fist

154
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,874
while the teeth of the
prisoners weren't that strong.

155
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:01,072
Bruno Monschtet. A
German from Gdansk.

156
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:04,958
Head of the camp's political division.

157
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,996

00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,917
Acting corporal.

159
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,036
To me, a new convict, he advised to put

160
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,957
my conscience in order:

161
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,036
to get rid of my intellectual past

162
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,071
and start the life of a criminal.

163
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,996
- Why were you arrested? - I don't know.

164
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:24,873
Doesn't know why he was arrested.

165
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,951
Are we here for long?

166
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,108
Till the end of the war.

167
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,077
What? Do you want to
ask me something?

168
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,911
This is your passport.

169
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,874
You may lose your head
but never this number.

170
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,038
Red triangle. "Schutzahft - politisch".

171
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,991
"Schutzahft - politisch"?

172
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:05,073
Warning political safety arrest.

173
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,878
You're in the camp for your own safety.

174
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,070
- Our own safety? - Yes,
for your own safety.

175
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,031
You're such kind of criminals

176
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,072
that if you were free, fair
Lithuanians, the society,

177
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,030
outraged by your behaviour
would tear you to pieces.

178
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,991
The German government, worried...

179
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:24,873
- about your welfare, put you.
- We... into the camp.

180
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:25,989
We're the intelligentsia.

181
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,996
You want to protect us from the society?

182
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,996
How? To protect us from the society?

183
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,951
No, no, no, for such criminals

184
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,072
there's another paragraph
- a warning arrest -

185
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,916
so they wouldn't commit more crimes.

186
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:41,077
Those are criminals,
thieves and murders.

187
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,070
They wear green triangles.

188
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,950
We protect the society from them.

189
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,958
And we protect political
ones from the society.

190
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,912
There must be order. Understand?

191
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,956
Photographer of the camp.

192
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,110
Commandant Hoppe's
nephew Friedrich Lege.

193
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,874
He dedicated himself to
Stutthof town's widows

194
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:17,953
and grass-widows, not only
in photographic matters.

195
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,037
For kleptomaniac tendencies
he was reduced to a sergeant.

196
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,992
Only because of the uncle
he was sent from the marine

197
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,918
to the concentration
camp for rehabilitation.

198
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,072
Concentration camp is a
complex mill of the Reaper.

199
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,871
In the camp you have to be both

200
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,876
a psychologist and prophet.

201
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:50,878
In the camp no one ever
tells you what to do,

202
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,036
you have to understand it yourself.

203
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,878
A stick helps to understand.

204
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:59,959
Your worst enemy in the camp
is not the SS, not a Capo,

205
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,912
not the lice. Not even a crematorium.

206
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,070
Your worst enemy is yourself.

207
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,032
If for an instant you give
in to your lower instincts,

208
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,069
forget who you are,

209
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:16,037
and who you are supposed
to be, you're dead.

210
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,029
Get up!

211
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,951
Crawl!

212
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,075
Get up!

213
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,995
Crawl!

214
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:33,112
Ah, lawyers, advocates, prosecutors,

215
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:37,916
your rule is over, eh?

216
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,030
Now you're in my hands.

217
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,876
You shaved asses.

218
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,958
I assign punishments here.

219
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,030
Your new life will begin here, huh?

220
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,036
Wacek Kazlowski. Polish.

221
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:03,951
Amateur executor.

222
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,996
A celebrity of the camp.

223
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,958
Did away with several dozen prisoners.

224
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,912
The old prisoners told that Kazlowski

225
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:16,032
killed his own brother in the camp.

226
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,998
Everyone had to go
through Kazlowski's hell.

227
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,918
It was like quarantine of the newcomers.

228
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,076
The ones who didn't
go to Abraham during

229
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:30,029
these first few months

230
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,992
could consider themselves
to be experienced prisoners.

231
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,958
The Poles hung Wacek after the war.

232
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,917
Who wants to eat?

233
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:54,031
Who wants to eat?

234
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,075
You're the Professor?

235
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:58,916
Franz Bloy. From Cologne.

236
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,916
A thief. The green triangle.

237
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,871
Do you want to eat?

238
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:04,876
I have cutlets, want some?

239
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,110
- Want some cutlets? - I do. - Come.

240
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,075
Come, I'll give you some.

241
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:10,989
Hurry, hurry.

242
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:30,075
Wait here.

243
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,951
Waiting for cutlets, aren't you?

244
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,075
Shit! Shit! Shit!

245
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,996
Franciszek Rozinski. Polish.

246
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,956
Son of the Zakopane mountains.

247
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,871
He was a musician before the war,

248
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,035
played the pipe.

249
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,038
He got into the camp because
of a misunderstanding.

250
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,074
Before the war he was shy, gentle,

251
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,074
wouldn't hurt a fly.

252
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,871
In the camp he became famous for

253
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,876
sadism and alcoholism.

254
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,998
Franz Bloy. A German from Cologne.

255
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,037
Kind hearted and gifted
with various talents.

256
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:29,037
A tailor by profession, thief by vocation.

257
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,076
Ah, the Professor!

258
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,951
Well, did you eat the cutlets?

259
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:44,957
Were they good?

260
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,879
Shit, I didn't eat any cutlets.

261
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,877
Didn't give any?

262
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:52,956
That's how, but I told them to.

263
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,036
So the gutters ate them, huh?

264
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,036
Can't trust anyone.

265
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,036
Come to me tomorrow,

266
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,878
- I'll give you some myself.
- Tomorrow is tomorrow.

267
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,912
We have to live till tomorrow
or see it in a dream.

268
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,997
Listen, what kind of
creatures are biting us, huh?

269
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,958
Pediculus humanus vestimenti.

270
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,951
Bed bugs, you book rat.

271
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,070
But they bite just like the pubic lice.

272
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,996
Once I brought pubic lice from the city.

273
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,075
Tirus pubis.

274
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,915
What?

275
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,951
The pubic lice. Tirus pubis.

276
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,913
Ah, Lithuanians!

277
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:35,036
Caps off, caps on.

278
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,877
Good day.

279
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,916
Look who's come to visit us.

280
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,757
Good day.

281
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,875
Good day.

282
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,753
Here you go, we're trying bit by bit,

283
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,756
will they permit it or not...

284
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,917
- Good day. - Good day,
it's nice to see you.

285
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,958
Well, what do you think, Professor?

286
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:34,877
I think you stand wrong
at "attention", you see.

287
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:38,752
Have you ever seen a samovar, a kettle?

288
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,870
Attention!

289
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:48,957
Caps off!

290
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,759
Caps on!

291
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,757
March!

292
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,951
You see, the common sense rules

293
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,833
do not exist in the concentration camp.

294
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,758
Everything that we've learned in life

295
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,912
has to be tossed away, has to be erased.

296
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:28,959
Common sense is replaced
by the instincts of starvation,

297
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,873
cold, physical pain,

298
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,751
self-preservation.

299
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,752
The most important thing
in the camp is to adjust.

300
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,837
To adjust, to adjust, to
adjust! A human dies.

301
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,796
A beast is born.

302
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,753
A beast. Who doesn't understand this,

303
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,756
does not last long in the camp,

304
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:58,872
goes up in smoke through the
chimney of the crematorium.

305
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:06,952
You can kill a man in the camp.

306
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,838
There will be no questions,
no responsibility,

307
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,916
no court, no consideration.

308
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,838
You can kill a man for your pleasure.

309
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,791
Most importantly, you see,

310
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,798
the fear of death disappears.

311
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:30,955
The fear of cold,

312
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:32,988
the fear of physical pain remains.

313
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:34,909
But not of death.

314
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,997
You today, me tomorrow,
what's the difference?

315
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,877
Everything goes away,
everything goes by.

316
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,918
Yes, but somewhere
deep in the subconscious

317
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,996
there is a whisper that

318
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,799
it's better that you today
and me tomorrow.

319
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,797
I realize that a camp on the stage

320
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,758
and a camp in reality
are two different things.

321
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,916
On the stage you need
to find some artistic

322
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,952
form to unify the whole performance.

323
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,872
But please, refuse all these "Heil Hitler",

324
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,910
these exaggerated moans.

325
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,871
A stick.

326
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,955
It is the most important tool in the camp.

327
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,830
Use the stick wherever it lands.

328
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,756
Wherever it lands, you see.

329
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,791
Turn off the light!

330
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,956
That's why I think there should be

331
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,871
no props in the play.

332
00:23:48,920 --> 00:23:50,831
...no property.

333
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:54,957
Property on the stage
is like a live mouse

334
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,798
in the teeth of a painted cat.

335
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,752
Let's reject it, let's not
eviscerate the subject,

336
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,792
let's refuse all these clichés.
Let in some fresh air.

337
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:53,994
What were you?

338
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,837
Who, me?

339
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:02,799
A professor. A professor
at Munich University.

340
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:05,915
I was a poet.

341
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:10,839
Now, as you see, I'm uprooting a stump.

342
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:13,949
Uprooting a stump.

343
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,836
Want an easier job?

344
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:18,955
Who, me?

345
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,830
Martin. A criminal by profession.

346
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:40,878
Sweat out like this and
you won't last a week.

347
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,955
And remember,

348
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:43,954
moving is what matters in the camp.

349
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,830
Take branches from
here and bring there.

350
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,916
Take branches from
there and bring here.

351
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,918
The same tomorrow. And
the day after tomorrow.

352
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,836
Forest of the Gods.

353
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,911
That's how people called this
place from the ancient times.

354
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,831
Once upon a time,

355
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,871
Gods live in this forest,

356
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,876
not of the German origin

357
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,831
but Lithuanian Gods,

358
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,792
descendants of Perkunas, Patrimpas.

359
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,992
Forest of the Gods, a little known recess

360
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,955
near the Baltic Sea.

361
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,798
After the war between
Poland and Germany,

362
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,752
in the fall of 1939,

363
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,872
the SS men moved into the swamps

364
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:32,832
together with several hundred
ragged prisoners in stripes.

365
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,793
Most of them were Poles from Gdansk

366
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,994
doomed to death.

367
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:39,994
Felling of the forest began,

368
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:41,909
uprooting of the stumps,

369
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:43,951
flattening of the surface.

370
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:47,957
Forest of the Gods turned
into a concentration camp.

371
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,918
The highest authority
in "Forest of the Gods"

372
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,871
was held by Rudolf Hoppe,

373
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:59,833
Commandant of the Stutthof camp.

374
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:03,797
He was a typical head
of the German family.

375
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,758
Maybe at home he wasn't

376
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,836
a bad daddy at all.

377
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,756
The Commandant was very proud

378
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,837
of his extraordinary position
and his SS uniform.

379
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,791
The prisoners nicknamed him

380
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,956
Graf von Stutthof because of his pride.

381
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,797
Commandant Hoppe
wasn't a thug after all.

382
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:24,956
He never hit prisoners himself.

383
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:01,919
I'd like to have this
sakura's branch for a gift.

384
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,916
How beautiful...

385
00:28:19,920 --> 00:28:21,876
Let me call you

386
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,838
sakura's branch.

387
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:40,797
The highest priest accused them,

388
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,837
"We forbid you..."

389
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,758
Jehovah's Witnesses,
researches of the Bible.

390
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,917
A German sect refusing to join the army.

391
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,990
This was also a crime.

392
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,748
The representative of Jehovah's
Witnesses in women barracks

393
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,949
was Frau Belenke.

394
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:02,955
A woman of great energy, very brave.

395
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,796
Commandant Hoppe was less hard

396
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,876
on the German prisoners

397
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,950
Frau Belenke was well aware of that.

398
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,829
Frau Belenke, you're in
the prime of your life.

399
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,876
But you're here in the camp.

400
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:26,876
You are free,

401
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,956
just put a signature.

402
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:31,949
Think of your home.

403
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,955
A woman should bring up her kids.

404
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:36,949
Just sign

405
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:40,838
that you refuse this

406
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,876
Jehovah's Witnesses nonsense.

407
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,911
And off you go.

408
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,910
You Nazis, what right do you have to put

409
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,918
innocent people into
concentration camps?

410
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,838
You should be the
ones to go up in smoke

411
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,950
through the crematorium chimney.

412
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:04,751
I'll wait for the day

413
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,871
when you Nazis all get shot.

414
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,916
I'll leave the camp myself.

415
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,996
Without any signature.

416
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:19,911
Out of here, you old witch!

417
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,875
Out!

418
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:37,909
Nazi pigs.

419
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:45,839
Fugitives were one of the greatest
misfortunes for the whole camp.

420
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,957
Both the SS and
prisoners despised them.

421
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,831
There were reasons for that.

422
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,751
The whole camp had to stand still

423
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,949
till a fugitive was found,

424
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,910
beaten, bloody, ripped by dogs.

425
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,799
One would be returned to
the camp, dead or alive.

426
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,758
The prisoners stand for long hours.

427
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:09,958
What names could a crowd
of thousand prisoners

428
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,751
call such a fugitive?

429
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,796
The entire surrounding of the camp

430
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,752
was full of police and the SS agents.

431
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:21,788
It wasn't a bright idea to
run away from the camp.

432
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,910
And yet people did.

433
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,750
The Ukrainian Stepan was
an incomparable fugitive.

434
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,831
A circus acrobat from Lvov.

435
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,831
Three times escaped,

436
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:35,950
three times was caught.

437
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,916
For one such a loser

438
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,838
thousands of people had to suffer.

439
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,875
So then...

440
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,793
How did you climb over the fence?

441
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,757
With rubber shoes.

442
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,791
Yes, like that, but

443
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,796
what about electricity?

444
00:32:56,840 --> 00:32:58,910
Of course, you wore galoshes.

445
00:32:59,960 --> 00:33:01,916
And your hands?

446
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:04,831
I wrapped them in rubber

447
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,876
and climbed over.

448
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,748
And the guards? Didn't they see you?

449
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,756
Where were the guards?

450
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,798
Maybe in a women barrack?

451
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:22,792
Good... very good.

452
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:28,958
So that's our fences now? Shit!

453
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,878
So that's our guard! Shit!

454
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,876
Do you want to the front?!

455
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,797
Do you?!

456
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,951
A cigarette? Do you smoke?

457
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:59,752
Good boy. Why shouldn't you run?

458
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:00,955
Especially

459
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:02,875
if these idiots

460
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,830
don't guard you. So run.

461
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:10,792
Yes! Good. Run, run.

462
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:23,912
Walter Sauer. A German.

463
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:25,909
According to his documents,

464
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,794
he was sentenced seventeen
times for children torture.

465
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,752
He ended up in the camp
for an innocent thing,

466
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:34,756
for hopeless alcoholism.

467
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,879
After an attempt on Hitler strange
audience turned up in the camp.

468
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:42,753
All of them were nice specimens.

469
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,956
One better than the other.

470
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:47,950
Psychopathologists of most interest.

471
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:53,799
Oskar Belanau, owner of
several hotels in Munich,

472
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,796
a member of the Nazi party.

473
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:58,950
He stole the whole truck of meat.

474
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,756
He didn't work in the camp,

475
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,870
was busy organizing things to eat.

476
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,752
Rainer Nietzsche, a garden architecture.

477
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,753
He loved to say that he got into the camp

478
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,791
because of intimate relations
with the Polish girls.

479
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:17,798
It was rather cocaine
than the Polish girls.

480
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:20,798
Then this perverted
crooked looking citizen

481
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,909
was brought in.

482
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,838
His documents said neither this nor that,

483
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,917
some indefinite relations with a cow.

484
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,837
At the beginning prostitutes

485
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:38,758
were described as the
elements avoiding work.

486
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:40,836
They protested against saying they

487
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,791
weren't avoiding work.

488
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:44,796
They were working, all the time!

489
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,877
Later on the Commandant listed
the prostitutes in a political group.

490
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,832
They were given the
right to wear red triangle.

491
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:54,839
Women with children also got
here, some still breast feeding.

492
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:56,950
An infant is also a human, so the infants

493
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,955
were given red triangles
of the political criminals.

494
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:07,788
Prisoners were killed slowly
in "Forest of the Gods".

495
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:10,917
Hard labour drained out their health.

496
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,792
Several dozen prisoners
managed to survive

497
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,910
from the very first day of the camp.

498
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,996
Those were extraordinary people,

499
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,990
people of great physical strength and will,

500
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,796
protected by the very destiny.

501
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,910
Through the hard work, cruelty,

502
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:28,954
and desire to live they managed

503
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,751
to get into the authorities.

504
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,916
So the true power of the camp was

505
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,838
in the hands of the prisoners.

506
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,837
Hey, shitheads!

507
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,997
Take the corpses from
the block to the hospital!

508
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,797
One, two, three...

509
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,792
Franciszek! Franciszek!

510
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,795
What?

511
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:21,798
Why did you give me the papers
to sign that nine died today?

512
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,798
There's only eight! Can't
you count, you pig?

513
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:27,798
Eight? I counted nine myself.

514
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,752
You go ahead and count
how many are there.

515
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:34,918
Listen, if you don't find the ninth
corpse, beware, I'll put you in its place.

516
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,950
Now where are you
hanging about, shithead?

517
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,830
Where's your place, huh?

518
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:55,838
Sir Straffurer, Sir Straffurer...

519
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:57,871
What are you saying there?

520
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,797
My stomach aches.

521
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,876
What are you saying there, fuck face?

522
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:04,758
Where's your place?

523
00:40:04,840 --> 00:40:07,798
Lie down, I tell you! Lie down!

524
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,955
Well? What did I tell you?

525
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,916
How many? Nine.

526
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:16,829
Nine.

527
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,916
Professor, I wake up in the morning

528
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,952
and I see that my foot
is in Andrzej's mouth.

529
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:55,916
I try to pull it out but
it's fast in his teeth.

530
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,838
I pull it out and I see that he's dead.

531
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,759
Could it be I suffocated the
poor thing with my foot?

532
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:07,916
See how things happen.

533
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,796
Well that's some poetry, huh?

534
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,916
Well that's some poetry, huh?

535
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,838
Momento tu more, momento tu more...

536
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:48,356
Rainer Kliauge. A German.

537
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:53,313
Capo of the belt weaving
workshop. Slimy character.

538
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:56,318
The prisoners called him Fraulein Capo.

539
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:59,318
Before the war he sang,
danced in an operetta

540
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,316
and was considered for a man.

541
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:04,272
Before the Easter he
caught the spotted typhus

542
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:07,198
and gave his sole to the Lord God.

543
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,309
Fraulein Capo,

544
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:22,198
would it be possible to smoke?

545
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:25,193
Where do you think you are,

546
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,196
in a resort, you book rat?

547
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:33,312
A resort? What are you staring at, huh?

548
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,157
Does it hurt?

549
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,231
- Does it hurt? - It does.

550
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,316
Aha. It does...

551
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:46,231
Attention!

552
00:42:57,240 --> 00:43:01,233
- This one? - A professor
from Munich University.

553
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,231
You!

554
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:09,276
Into the office!

555
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:16,196
Change his clothes.

556
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:23,273
Martin Fott. A German
from Düsseldorf, Capo.

557
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:26,158
Got into the camp for a murder.

558
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:30,193
The prisoners called him Capo the
Benefactor. Too bad he hanged himself.

559
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:33,231
- Do you have golden teeth? - No.

560
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,157
Open your mouth.

561
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,316
It's good you don't.

562
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:41,239
After I record your teeth in
the book of registration,

563
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:44,317
you'll have to look after them,
property of the German Treasury.

564
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:47,352
- Do you have golden teeth?
- Ne. - Open your mouth.

565
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:50,311
It's good you don't.

566
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,272
After I record your teeth in
the book of registration,

567
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:58,154
you'll have to look after them,
property of the German Treasury.

568
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,350
What the fuck are you doing
in the camp if you're ill?

569
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:03,196
- Surname? Nationality? - Ukrainian.

570
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,152
- What's your nationality,
swine? - Orthodox.

571
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,196
Your nationality, not religion!

572
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,151
- Russian. - Repeat.

573
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:13,269
Russian!

574
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:16,158
Good boy! So then say you're a Russian.

575
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:18,316
Where was your Ukraine
before the war, asshole?

576
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,196
There is no Ukraine and there won't be!

577
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,389
Poland!

578
00:44:24,360 --> 00:44:26,271
So, shithead,

579
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,354
how do you know

580
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:31,270
there is meat in the soup?

581
00:44:32,360 --> 00:44:36,194
There has to be meat in the
soup, Herr Commandant.

582
00:44:38,360 --> 00:44:41,318
So you refuse to eat the soup?

583
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:46,151
I do, Herr Commandant.

584
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,278
I can't eat meat because of my religion.

585
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:51,191
Okay...

586
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,238
I was told you read English books

587
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,271
in the camp, correct?

588
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:04,158
Yes, Herr Commandant, I do.

589
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,310
So you think England will win this war

590
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:11,238
and you tell this to everyone?

591
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:14,158
Yes, Herr Commandant.

592
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:18,273
I'm convinced the Germans
have already lost the war.

593
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,349
Out!

594
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,191
Shithead!

595
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,355
Out!

596
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,349
Pigs!

597
00:46:03,320 --> 00:46:06,153
Mr. Germinski! Mr. Germinski!

598
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,310
Mr. Germinski, the banker of Liubek

599
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:15,318
went to Abraham but he's still on the list.

600
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,310
- What should I do? - Cross him out.

601
00:46:20,320 --> 00:46:22,356
Why did you beat that Ukrainian?

602
00:46:23,160 --> 00:46:24,309
Give me the soap.

603
00:46:26,280 --> 00:46:29,158
You asked him to tell the truth and he did.

604
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,315
Why to beat him?

605
00:46:30,360 --> 00:46:32,237
Do you know, Mr. Professor,

606
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:36,273
what these Ukrainians did to us,
Polish soldiers, when the war started?

607
00:46:36,320 --> 00:46:38,356
They shot at us from the ambush.

608
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,158
Not this one. He's too stupid.

609
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:45,231
Can't tell a gun from cannon.

610
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,236
And why then do you beat the Poles?

611
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:52,238
It's necessary to beat them.
I do good beating them.

612
00:46:52,280 --> 00:46:54,271
I teach them life. Most importantly,

613
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:59,155
beat them while they're well. If
you don't, they'll weaken and die.

614
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,350
Your theory is very
gloomy, Mr. Germinski.

615
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:05,279
So what, no one beat you
Lithuanians at the beginning?

616
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:08,153
How many of you will be left after a year?

617
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,270
In the best case maybe five.

618
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,356
You know, Mr. Professor,

619
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:15,196
from the whole group of Polish prisoners

620
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:18,152
I came to camp with I
am the sole survivor.

621
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,191
Do you understand what that means?

622
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,277
Son of a whore, you're
so naive, Professor.

623
00:47:23,360 --> 00:47:26,318
You learn from books but not from life.

624
00:47:26,360 --> 00:47:29,272
It's not people' fault, it's the system.

625
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:31,356
The Germans created the system.

626
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:33,311
We execute it.

627
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,354
Try uniting the prisoners

628
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,312
and you won't be able to talk to them.

629
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,236
Everybody is hungry in here.

630
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:46,159
I broke the bones of one
slimeball, you know why?

631
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:49,357
Because he ripped out the
liver of a recently dead man

632
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,311
and stodged it raw!

633
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,236
Now you tell me, Mr. Professor,

634
00:47:59,280 --> 00:48:01,396
was that prisoner born a cannibal?

635
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:05,358
No, he was born like a normal person,

636
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,350
had a father, mother, a motherland.

637
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,312
The camp turned him into
a cannibal, understand?

638
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:15,397
When you go up in smoke through
the crematorium chimney,

639
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:19,152
maybe then you'll understand
that I was telling the truth!

640
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:21,191
Book rat, get the fuck out of here!

641
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,276
Son of a bitch, fucking hell!

642
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:25,390
Piece of shit! You fucking swine...

643
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:15,319
Arno Pliac. A German sergeant.

644
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:18,276
Head of the camp's post office.

645
00:49:18,320 --> 00:49:21,278
Before the war in Gdansk
he scraped horse manure

646
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:24,357
with an iron stick from
the tracks of a trolley-car.

647
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,197
The most pedantic creature
in the whole camp.

648
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,349
"Only devil knows

649
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:59,277
how long I'll be cooped up in the camp".

650
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:02,389
No!

651
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,237
You can't use devil's name in a letter.

652
00:50:09,320 --> 00:50:11,311
In a letter you can write,

653
00:50:13,360 --> 00:50:16,397
"I received the letter
and a package well."

654
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:20,197
"Thank you very much,
please send more".

655
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,158
"I'm safe and sound".

656
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,236
"I feel great, kisses to all".

657
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:27,157
Sir Statführer,

658
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:31,188
but then I shouldn't bother
writing at all, you see.

659
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:36,189
You'll rubber-stamp papers like that,
we'll sign and everything will be fine.

660
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,157
Out!

661
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:24,195
"It's a terribly boring business
to sit behind the rusty wires".

662
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:29,313
How dare you write
"behind the rusty wires"?

663
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:35,352
Don't you see anything else in the camp?

664
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:40,192
Don't you see the birches growing?

665
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:43,355
I told you what to write, you are well.

666
00:51:44,160 --> 00:51:46,151
Sir Statführer,

667
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:50,159
how can I write I'm well
when I'm truly sick?

668
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,356
- Look at my... - Out.

669
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:56,279
Sir, take pity, be merciful,

670
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:58,271
send this letter.

671
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,278
Look, we'll fix everything, look, here,

672
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,357
I'm crossing out this sentence, right?

673
00:52:07,360 --> 00:52:10,272
And this one.

674
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:14,312
Here, send this letter, sir Statführer.

675
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:17,278
And in the next one I'll definitely write

676
00:52:17,320 --> 00:52:20,232
that our electric wire shines like silver,

677
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,352
that, as you say, there are three birches,

678
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:28,159
two stumps, and two mushrooms.

679
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,153
Send this letter and in the next one

680
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:35,158
I will definitely write
that I'm well according

681
00:52:35,200 --> 00:52:37,270
to all the existing rules of the camp.

682
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,198
Be so kind, send this letter.

683
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,191
Out.

684
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,390
Thrash him so that water boils in his ass.

685
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:19,157
How many?

686
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:20,355
Thirty.

687
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:46,158
Mr. Professor, you're a wise man,

688
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:48,191
help me get rid of my doubts.

689
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:50,151
What doubts?

690
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,232
Is my surname, Klawan, truly Germanic?

691
00:53:58,240 --> 00:54:02,279
Are there no Jewish letters in it?

692
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:06,237
Klawan.

693
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,196
Now I could be wrong.

694
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:22,152
According to the theory of racism,

695
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:26,318
all names ending in "an" are Mongolian.

696
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,311
What do you mean?

697
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:36,352
Kaftan, sarafan, hooligan, sultan, moron.

698
00:54:37,360 --> 00:54:40,193
That's Mongolian names and nouns.

699
00:54:40,240 --> 00:54:42,310
But Professor, what you've just named

700
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,316
are the names of things

701
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:48,148
while my surname is a
person's last name. Klawan.

702
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:50,156
But there are plenty of last names.

703
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,158
For example, Kazakhstan, Yerevan,

704
00:54:53,240 --> 00:54:57,153
Afganistan, Gengis Khan. All Mongolian.

705
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:07,279
Professor, my last name
is purely Germanic.

706
00:55:08,160 --> 00:55:11,357
Inflection "an" is a pure inflection
of Germanic language.

707
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:15,192
German, Norman, Japan.

708
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:20,279
So the Japanese also belong to
the Northern Germanic race?

709
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:23,191
Of course! How else the Führer

710
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,310
could make a union with them?

711
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:29,355
Okay then.

712
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:34,199
If the Japanese are Germanic,

713
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:37,357
then in your case the theory
of racism doesn't apply.

714
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:44,357
So, in other words, my
last name is Germanic.

715
00:55:46,320 --> 00:55:48,390
Yes. Klawan.

716
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,151
Yes, Klawan.

717
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:56,231
Thank you, Professor.

718
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,237
Peter Klawan. Sergeant.

719
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,151
A total idiot.

720
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,236
Was born and grew up in Estonia.

721
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:14,350
Served some German baron.

722
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:17,350
Klawan's heart was wide as the sea.

723
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,278
All kind of garbage could fit in.

724
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:24,234
In the camp he became
interested in his family tree.

725
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,191
He never really realised

726
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:29,198
whether he's Estonian,
Mongolian or German.

727
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,354
Oh fuck.

728
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,269
Wacek!

729
00:56:44,160 --> 00:56:46,230
Shit. Come here.

730
00:56:46,280 --> 00:56:47,349
You swine.

731
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:57,191
Come here.

732
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,197
Fuck yourself.

733
00:57:01,320 --> 00:57:04,278
We'll hang Wacek
Kazlowski after the war.

734
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,157
Mr. Professor.

735
00:57:10,320 --> 00:57:12,231
The numbers of two people

736
00:57:12,280 --> 00:57:14,316
need to be changed in the book.

737
00:57:16,280 --> 00:57:18,271
You won't be scared, will you?

738
00:57:18,360 --> 00:57:20,271
August Zagorski.

739
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:23,232
A Pole from Gdansk, used to be a barber.

740
00:57:23,280 --> 00:57:26,272
One of the leaders of the Polish
underground in the camp.

741
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,356
Very honest and respectable man.

742
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,191
Registration book of the prisoners,

743
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:38,198
piece of shit, not a book!
None of the ends meet!

744
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,355
What's that?!

745
00:57:46,200 --> 00:57:47,394
- Wife? - Yes.

746
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,191
This is my family.

747
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,157
A son?

748
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,191
A daughter.

749
00:58:11,160 --> 00:58:14,311
Prisoners are not allowed
to have photographs.

750
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:17,349
Zagorski, twenty five,

751
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:20,276
so that water boils in his ass.

752
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,191
Fucking hell!

753
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,156
Hang both!

754
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,196
What do you think, Professor?

755
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,152
You see, that phrase
has to be said very...

756
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:51,273
...very indifferently, very
simply. You hang every day.

757
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:56,232
By the way, you are similar to...

758
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:01,276
...to Corporal Traugot Mayer.

759
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:06,279
He had right here, under
his lashes, two letters SS.

760
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:11,272
In other words, I won't sell my beliefs.

761
00:59:13,360 --> 00:59:16,238
My play is a creative presumption.

762
00:59:17,360 --> 00:59:20,352
Alas, everything works differently in life.

763
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:26,159
You won't be neither hanged
nor killed on the stage.

764
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:30,276
What I've gone through, believe me,

765
00:59:30,320 --> 00:59:32,356
I remember perfectly.

766
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:37,277
And what I've written is imperfect.

767
00:59:40,320 --> 00:59:43,198
The dialogues are too long,

768
00:59:44,160 --> 00:59:46,310
they lose their strength.

769
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:50,357
Remarks. They have to be
shortened. I don't know.

770
00:59:51,160 --> 00:59:53,151
I don't know.

771
01:00:23,600 --> 01:00:26,558
Excuse me, can I help?

772
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:30,434
Friend, what's the matter?
Stand up, you'll freeze.

773
01:00:30,600 --> 01:00:32,556
You don't feel well?

774
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,556
Let go, let me go...

775
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,436
What did I spit out?

776
01:01:12,480 --> 01:01:13,549
What?

777
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,433
- Maybe it's your tongue. - What?

778
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,516
My tongue is okay.

779
01:01:23,560 --> 01:01:25,516
Maybe teeth?

780
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,398
Teeth are also fine.

781
01:01:31,640 --> 01:01:34,518
It's better to leave your teeth at home

782
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,516
when going to the camp.

783
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:42,393
Listen, what did I spit out?

784
01:01:45,400 --> 01:01:47,391
Maybe my tonsillitis?

785
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:54,597
That's right, tonsillitis.

786
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:59,512
Good, I won't suffer from tonsillitis.

787
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:06,511
Zygfrid Heidel.

788
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:10,394
A pure Bavarian. Obershtürmbamführer,

789
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:12,556
the chief doctor of the camp.

790
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,433
He was a veterinarian in civilian life.

791
01:02:15,480 --> 01:02:18,472
The prisoners called
him "Bocian Bawarski",

792
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,431
"Bavarian stork".

793
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:22,550
He used to fake death certificates.

794
01:02:22,600 --> 01:02:24,511
He would write "frei Tot",

795
01:02:24,560 --> 01:02:27,438
meaning the prisoner died his own death.

796
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,438
No, my eye. My eye, kaput.

797
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,517
Caps on. Show your tongue.

798
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,470
What's with the book rat?

799
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:51,511
Probably pneumonia.

800
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,511
I told him he'd go up in smoke

801
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:56,518
through the chimney of the crematorium.

802
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,596
God damned fleas.

803
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:17,393
And take him to the barrack.

804
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,591
Christmas is soon.

805
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,516
Tomorrow is Thursday.

806
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,550
The day after tomorrow is Friday.

807
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,436
A letter day.

808
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,512
My wife stopped writing
for some reasons.

809
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:22,398
Here, Professor, take the beet.

810
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:25,594
It improves blood.

811
01:04:32,560 --> 01:04:35,518
Tadas Dailide. A brewer from Birzai.

812
01:04:35,560 --> 01:04:38,393
Arrested because of a misunderstanding.

813
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:40,396
He made homebrew in the camp

814
01:04:40,440 --> 01:04:41,634
what helped him to survive.

815
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,516
After the war he emigrated to America.

816
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:16,398
Son of a whore!

817
01:05:20,440 --> 01:05:23,477
Love was strictly forbidden in the camp.

818
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,472
But what is wired fence to love?

819
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,511
Lovers communicated mostly

820
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:33,592
through intermediates, the postmen.

821
01:05:35,480 --> 01:05:38,392
The authorities always caught the letters.

822
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:41,477
Usually they were in Polish or Russian.

823
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:45,632
Our office had to translate
them into German.

824
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:49,517
We would swear translating those letters.

825
01:05:51,400 --> 01:05:54,517
No one else on earth
but the camp prisoners

826
01:05:54,560 --> 01:05:57,518
would ever write such stupid letters.

827
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:15,513
I, Kristina, take you,
Krzysztof, for my husband.

828
01:06:16,400 --> 01:06:18,391
I swear to love you forever,

829
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,510
to be faithful and honest in marriage.

830
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,471
I swear to stay with you,

831
01:06:22,520 --> 01:06:25,512
in sadness and joy, in
health and sickness,

832
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:27,516
in wealth and poverty.

833
01:06:27,560 --> 01:06:30,438
Help me God and all the Saints.

834
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:20,436
Hang both.

835
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,436
The priest as well.

836
01:08:23,400 --> 01:08:25,436
To Wacek's health!

837
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,550
"I still remember, Wacek, your face..."

838
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:49,549
"...your eyes, your lips, your chin..."

839
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:55,558
"It's been ages since I saw you".

840
01:08:56,520 --> 01:08:58,590
"Maybe it's not much left to wait,

841
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:01,516
maybe I'll see you soon?"

842
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:07,519
"I need no one but you, Wacek!"

843
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,432
"When will I see your blue eyes again?"

844
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,398
So that's how my wife writes.

845
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,552
Once I was enlisted in the Polish Army.

846
01:09:34,400 --> 01:09:36,391
And wife loved me.

847
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:41,517
The camp ruined everything.

848
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,596
I lost my health here.

849
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:52,438
My nerves are completely eaten.

850
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,591
When did you get the letter?

851
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:58,551
Three years ago.

852
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:01,516
Three years.

853
01:10:01,560 --> 01:10:03,551
To Wacek's health!

854
01:10:21,400 --> 01:10:22,549
And, Wacek,

855
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,591
my wife wrote to me

856
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,630
that she went to the Gestapo

857
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:32,396
and asked about me.

858
01:10:34,520 --> 01:10:37,592
And they said I was shot.

859
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,476
As if I were a criminal.

860
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,431
Poor thing.

861
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:53,473
Lord, oh Lord, how she's suffered.

862
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:00,517
The newcomers said that
Vilnius has been bombed.

863
01:11:02,520 --> 01:11:05,592
"I need no one but you, Wacek".

864
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:09,436
If I return to freedom

865
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:13,630
they'll put me right back into the camp.

866
01:11:14,600 --> 01:11:17,433
I refused to register as a German.

867
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:19,436
So my wife, little fool,

868
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,392
went and registered herself.

869
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,596
She was trying to help.

870
01:11:29,560 --> 01:11:33,394
If I return to freedom I'll
end up back in the camp

871
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,472
for contamination of the race.

872
01:11:38,520 --> 01:11:41,478
"I need no one but you, Wacek,

873
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,590
no one but you".

874
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:51,476
To Wacek's health!

875
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:05,591
Thank you very much, thank you.

876
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,517
Let me introduce myself. I am
Franz Bloy from Cologne.

877
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:12,476
A prisoner like you.

878
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:18,512
This concentration
camp was built in 1939

879
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,592
not far from Gdansk,
for the Poles to sizzle.

880
01:12:23,480 --> 01:12:25,550
As a part of evacuation plan

881
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,556
on their way to Abraham.

882
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,436
There, a chimney.

883
01:12:32,480 --> 01:12:34,391
That's a crematorium.

884
01:12:34,440 --> 01:12:36,476
This is the chimney through which

885
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:39,478
sooner or later we'll all go up in smoke.

886
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,478
If you have golden watches
you can give them to me...

887
01:12:42,520 --> 01:12:45,557
- Wacek, don't touch the Lithuanians,
understand? - Yes, Mr. Zagorski!

888
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,431
And don't overload them with work.

889
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:49,550
Give them more soup, they're
hungry, do you understand me?

890
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:53,479
- I'm warning you, Wacek. -
I know Mr. Zagorski, I know.

891
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:56,516
Fucking hell!

892
01:12:58,400 --> 01:12:59,628
Do you have syphilis?

893
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:04,438
Do you have feeble-minded relatives?

894
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:07,590
Do you have a tendency to a suicide?

895
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:11,477
Do you smoke?

896
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:13,391
I do.

897
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,516
Sir, you'll have to cut down.

898
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:20,512
The cigarette situation
is poor in the camp.

899
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,437
Do you drink?

900
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:24,516
Excuse me, what did you say?

901
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,596
Sir, do you drink vodka?

902
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:30,628
Do you like drinking?

903
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:32,549
Well yes, a little.

904
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:34,589
You'll have to quit.

905
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:38,428
You'll have to lead a
sober life in the camp.

906
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:43,551
Remember three things:

907
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:48,516
Don't drink water from the well,

908
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,516
you'll get cholera.

909
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:55,390
Watch your legs, illnesses will start.

910
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:59,433
And thirdly, don't get
your kidneys beaten.

911
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:02,516
On the whole...

912
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:06,432
...it's possible to live in the camp.

913
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:08,590
Out! Out! Out!

914
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:15,595
Attention!

915
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:22,549
Who are they?

916
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:24,511
Lithuanians.

917
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:29,473
Lithuanians are our biggest enemies.

918
01:14:30,560 --> 01:14:33,552
We'll find a mine for each of our enemy.

919
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:37,432
Yes, here and now!

920
01:14:42,480 --> 01:14:44,471
Out! Out! Shit...

921
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:38,433
Do you have what I've asked for?

922
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:40,555
No.

923
01:17:49,520 --> 01:17:51,511
Two stamps and an envelope.

924
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:55,396
We don't have stamps.

925
01:17:56,400 --> 01:17:58,436
We have envelopes. Want some?

926
01:17:58,600 --> 01:18:00,477
Maybe not.

927
01:18:04,440 --> 01:18:06,431
- Franciszek... - Well?

928
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:09,438
I need a carrot. But...

929
01:18:10,400 --> 01:18:12,391
...not a frozen carrot.

930
01:18:12,480 --> 01:18:13,595
We don't have carrots.

931
01:18:14,400 --> 01:18:16,516
Want a beet, you old pervert?

932
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:18,391
Do you?

933
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:20,510
Then out, go away, get out of here!

934
01:18:21,480 --> 01:18:23,471
- Mr. Superior. - Well?

935
01:18:23,600 --> 01:18:26,512
- I bought tooth powder
from you. - So be happy!

936
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,518
- But it's not usable. - What
do you mean not usable?

937
01:18:29,560 --> 01:18:31,551
You don't know how to
use that's why, go away.

938
01:18:31,600 --> 01:18:34,398
It hardened, turned into a piece of chalk.

939
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:37,432
- I'm asking you to exchange
it. - We change nothing here!

940
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,629
So what I'm supposed to do now?

941
01:18:39,400 --> 01:18:41,391
What do I care! Eat it!

942
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,511
Give back my money.

943
01:18:44,440 --> 01:18:46,590
Listen you, fucking book rat,

944
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:49,590
It's not a Gdansk market!

945
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:51,628
It's a camp store!

946
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,470
For fuck's sake, give back my money!

947
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:56,556
Motherfucker, I'll show you your teeth,

948
01:18:56,600 --> 01:18:58,591
I'll knock your teeth out, asshole!

949
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:01,473
I'm closing! Everybody out!

950
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:05,513
I'm open only to the officers, out! Shit!

951
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,630
Yesterday I took my mother to hospital,

952
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:16,392
so, I'd like to buy her
fresh cottage cheese.

953
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,516
But everything is so expensive.

954
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,550
Cut it into pieces, the hell with you.

955
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:25,591
Otherwise you fool me

956
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:28,438
and I won't know whose mug to hit.

957
01:19:59,440 --> 01:20:01,476
- Good day, Professor. - Hello.

958
01:20:01,520 --> 01:20:03,397
How are you?

959
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:06,432
- How is your wife and
daughter? - They're away.

960
01:20:07,400 --> 01:20:08,515
For long?

961
01:20:08,560 --> 01:20:10,516
Yes, but they'll come back.

962
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:14,439
Then buy some dresses. New,
pretty. For your daughter.

963
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:15,595
Maybe I will.

964
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,436
You know what, I'll buy this one.

965
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:20,591
And that one.

966
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,396
Yes, yes, editor, yes.

967
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:29,432
That sentence in red must remain.

968
01:20:32,240 --> 01:20:34,390
What are you saying?
A drastic sentence?

969
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:40,313
But we're not talking about
sentimental things here.

970
01:20:43,320 --> 01:20:47,233
It's about a concentration
camp. Such was the reality.

971
01:20:51,240 --> 01:20:53,310
No point to bullshit,

972
01:20:53,400 --> 01:20:56,233
no point to throw dust in the eyes.

973
01:20:57,320 --> 01:21:01,393
Yes, dear editor, yes, I'm
aware of what I write.

974
01:21:06,360 --> 01:21:09,238
Editor, I can't stand clichés.

975
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:12,273
What's wrong with that sentence?

976
01:21:13,400 --> 01:21:15,277
What?

977
01:21:16,240 --> 01:21:18,276
What's wrong with the sentence

978
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,233
"They rushed along to Abraham"?

979
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:24,396
Yes, they were killed!

980
01:21:24,440 --> 01:21:27,238
This is getting disgusting.

981
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:30,272
You can't poison people
with such clichés.

982
01:21:32,240 --> 01:21:35,391
Be kind, my angel,

983
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,439
leave that sentence, it's
absolutely innocent.

984
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,272
My style will be ruined if you take it out.

985
01:21:52,440 --> 01:21:56,399
Yes, yes, the Germans appointed a Pole

986
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:00,432
to be the chief of the
barrack, that's correct.

987
01:22:03,360 --> 01:22:06,397
Who? You don't like the
pregnant Polish woman?

988
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:12,232
Well yes, a pregnant
Polish woman participated

989
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:15,238
in the Warsaw revolt and arrived

990
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:17,271
to the camp in uniform.

991
01:22:20,440 --> 01:22:23,398
But this episode only highlights

992
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:26,310
the heroism of the Polish nation.

993
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:29,430
I know you're the editor in charge.

994
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:36,238
Yes, you have the final word, I know.

995
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:41,392
I'm tired of defending every sentence.

996
01:22:42,280 --> 01:22:45,272
Cross out the entire chapter, if you want!

997
01:22:45,320 --> 01:22:49,279
But I won't let you cross out
separate sentences! Understand?

998
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:51,434
Fucking asshole.

999
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,237
Shit.

1000
01:22:54,280 --> 01:22:55,429
Lithuanians!

1001
01:22:57,320 --> 01:22:59,390
We received an order saying

1002
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:02,231
that from this day on

1003
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:06,273
all you become prisoners of honour.

1004
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:13,236
From this moment

1005
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,430
I, Commandant Hoppe,

1006
01:23:16,280 --> 01:23:18,430
am your direct chief.

1007
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:23,430
You don't have to get your hair cut

1008
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,434
as required in prison.

1009
01:23:26,240 --> 01:23:27,468
If it's still growing!

1010
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:30,429
From now on

1011
01:23:31,280 --> 01:23:33,430
work is not obligatory

1012
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:37,390
but if you wish, you can work.

1013
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:39,351
As a volunteer.

1014
01:23:40,360 --> 01:23:45,354
You can write letters and
receive packages every week.

1015
01:23:46,240 --> 01:23:49,357
But not a word about politics

1016
01:23:50,440 --> 01:23:54,228
nor camp life in your letters.
You're still prisoners.

1017
01:23:54,280 --> 01:23:57,431
Even though prisoners
of honour, yet prisoners.

1018
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:02,357
You are free within the
territory of the camp.

1019
01:24:06,280 --> 01:24:09,352
Only with my permission
you can walk around,

1020
01:24:09,480 --> 01:24:11,311
you can sing,

1021
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:15,432
you can pray, you can laugh.

1022
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,476
You're even allowed to dance!

1023
01:24:25,240 --> 01:24:31,315
S, steward Vladas. The
soul of steward Vladas.

1024
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,271
Maybe cheating?

1025
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:38,233
We invited Julius Caesar.

1026
01:24:43,240 --> 01:24:44,434
Ask.

1027
01:24:47,320 --> 01:24:50,278
Soul of steward Vladas,

1028
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:53,318
tell us, when will the war end?

1029
01:24:54,280 --> 01:24:57,272
You'd better ask when we get out of here.

1030
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,312
We'll get out of here when the war ends.

1031
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:04,395
One...

1032
01:25:22,280 --> 01:25:23,429
...nine...

1033
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:30,393
You know, I also had a suit in Vilnius.

1034
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,396
Of good English wool.

1035
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:36,430
The Jew Levin made it for me.

1036
01:25:39,280 --> 01:25:42,431
I wonder who's wearing it now?

1037
01:25:43,360 --> 01:25:45,271
- Here? - Yes, here.

1038
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,276
Sir, shall we?

1039
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:05,317
We knew the war was coming to an end.

1040
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:09,399
The authorities changed their
position towards the prisoners.

1041
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:13,274
The camp had no eye doctor
so Commandant Hoppe

1042
01:26:13,440 --> 01:26:17,399
allowed me to go to Gdansk
for a specialist to examine.

1043
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:28,352
The head of Gdansk
eye clinics, a professor,

1044
01:26:28,480 --> 01:26:30,471
having found who I was

1045
01:26:31,280 --> 01:26:33,396
examined my eyes for the whole hour.

1046
01:26:33,440 --> 01:26:36,318
Talked friendly as if with a colleague

1047
01:26:36,360 --> 01:26:39,318
and ignored the fact that
Germans were waiting

1048
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:41,430
outside the door for their turn.

1049
01:26:44,320 --> 01:26:46,390
I'd let you walk alone in the town

1050
01:26:47,240 --> 01:26:49,310
but you know, they'll stop you,

1051
01:26:49,360 --> 01:26:51,316
ask for your documents.

1052
01:26:51,480 --> 01:26:54,313
Will suspect you escaped from the camp,

1053
01:26:54,360 --> 01:26:57,318
both you and me would get into trouble.

1054
01:26:59,360 --> 01:27:01,271
Let's better walk together.

1055
01:27:01,320 --> 01:27:03,276
Donate to Hitler.

1056
01:27:07,280 --> 01:27:10,352
Karl Janke, a German from Gdansk.

1057
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:13,432
Who knows why he
ended up in the Gestapo.

1058
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:17,392
Poor Janke, ended his
life in a Siberian camp.

1059
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:22,276
Could we listen to the radio?

1060
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:25,316
You know, they often tell news

1061
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,316
from the front on the radio.

1062
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:29,351
No, no, no, it's politics.

1063
01:27:29,400 --> 01:27:31,311
We fear politics like death.

1064
01:27:31,360 --> 01:27:33,316
You eat, eat.

1065
01:27:33,360 --> 01:27:34,429
Thank you.

1066
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,231
Don't worry, we won't starve.

1067
01:27:37,280 --> 01:27:41,273
- Mother, Gertruda and I will
consider your offer. - Professor.

1068
01:27:43,480 --> 01:27:45,436
Father, are you going to eat?

1069
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,474
How is my son-in-law?

1070
01:27:58,240 --> 01:28:00,390
Doesn't harm you too much, does he?

1071
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:05,396
Karl? A wonderful soldier.

1072
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:11,393
Are you really a professor
from Munich University?

1073
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,317
I was.

1074
01:28:13,360 --> 01:28:15,430
Ah, you're a convict now.

1075
01:28:16,360 --> 01:28:18,316
That is life.

1076
01:28:18,400 --> 01:28:21,233
To everybody one's own.

1077
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,351
The irony of fate,

1078
01:29:08,240 --> 01:29:10,356
from the letters of my wife I found out

1079
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:12,436
that when I was at the eye clinics

1080
01:29:13,240 --> 01:29:16,312
she and my daughter came
to Gdansk at the same time.

1081
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:18,351
They wanted to go to Stutthof.

1082
01:29:18,400 --> 01:29:20,391
But the Germans forbade it.

1083
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,436
The roads were blocked.

1084
01:29:23,400 --> 01:29:26,358
We lived hoping the meet again.

1085
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:30,319
I received her last letter after Christmas.

1086
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:02,352
What happened, sir corporal?

1087
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:06,276
Why aren't the prisoners going to work?

1088
01:30:06,320 --> 01:30:08,390
Sunday, a choir, a symphony.

1089
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:15,269
Is it a seaside resort or
a concentration camp?

1090
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,231
It was my idea.

1091
01:30:17,280 --> 01:30:18,429
- Your idea? - Yes.

1092
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:22,312
I convinced the Commandant

1093
01:30:22,440 --> 01:30:26,433
that at least every second Sunday
prisoners need to have a day off.

1094
01:30:27,240 --> 01:30:29,310
They are criminals, yet humans.

1095
01:30:30,360 --> 01:30:32,476
And Commandant
perfectly understood me.

1096
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:35,390
He says, "Wonderful
idea, so from now on

1097
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:39,274
you'll be on duty each
Sunday without exception".

1098
01:30:39,320 --> 01:30:41,356
He trusts me, Professor.

1099
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:45,312
You know, last Christmas

1100
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:48,273
he gave me a watch, look.

1101
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:50,237
Pure silver.

1102
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:52,356
And then I say to him,

1103
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:57,279
I grew up in a culturally
different country, Estonia.

1104
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:00,432
And, well, I'm against
physical punishments.

1105
01:31:01,440 --> 01:31:03,351
Our Commandant

1106
01:31:04,280 --> 01:31:06,430
is a very well educated man, so he says,

1107
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:10,238
"I'm also against physical punishments".

1108
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,349
Well, but...

1109
01:31:12,320 --> 01:31:14,311
To decorate the gibbet,

1110
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:16,316
it was also your idea, wasn't it?

1111
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:20,239
No, this is Commandant's idea.

1112
01:31:20,320 --> 01:31:21,469
You remember, Professor,

1113
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:23,468
you said to me once...

1114
01:31:24,280 --> 01:31:28,432
"Memento mori" - remember
you might be hanged.

1115
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:34,393
So today we'll perfectly mark
this Commandant's idea.

1116
01:31:34,440 --> 01:31:38,399
We've decided to hang a
Russian pilot, a woman.

1117
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:41,316
Right, if it's such a holiday,

1118
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:44,398
maybe the war is already over?

1119
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:48,318
Yes. The Germans will end the war.

1120
01:31:48,360 --> 01:31:50,316
What are you talking about?

1121
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:53,352
The Russians are already
by Vysla, sir corporal.

1122
01:31:53,400 --> 01:31:55,436
No, the Russians won't win the war.

1123
01:31:56,240 --> 01:31:59,391
And so won't the English.
Even the Americans.

1124
01:32:00,360 --> 01:32:03,432
Yes, maybe we, the
Germans, will lose the war.

1125
01:32:03,480 --> 01:32:06,278
Maybe... Maybe the Russians

1126
01:32:06,320 --> 01:32:08,390
will take over the entire Europe.

1127
01:32:08,480 --> 01:32:11,313
Maybe Europe will be communistic.

1128
01:32:11,360 --> 01:32:13,430
But we, the Germans, her Professor,

1129
01:32:15,240 --> 01:32:18,232
are the nation of talent
and we'll rule Europe.

1130
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:20,430
Maybe via foreign hands, but we will.

1131
01:33:17,280 --> 01:33:19,271
After the war, when a human

1132
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:21,470
gets out of blood and starvation,

1133
01:33:22,240 --> 01:33:25,312
when he looks around
and shakes off the ashes,

1134
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:29,399
when he feels a wish to be
reborn, theatre will help him.

1135
01:33:32,320 --> 01:33:36,359
A human full of blood, dirt and death

1136
01:33:37,480 --> 01:33:42,429
will want to see light in the
theatre, poetry and love.

1137
01:33:43,480 --> 01:33:46,358
The new post-war theatre should be

1138
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:51,399
a theatre of emotions, beauty and love.

1139
01:33:52,480 --> 01:33:58,316
It should portray the truth
that we so much long for.

1140
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:05,349
Okay.

1141
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:10,312
And here I finish my
lecture on the theatre.

1142
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:15,239
If God wishes and one day
we all meet here again

1143
01:34:15,280 --> 01:34:19,273
then I'll tell you about the
great German romantic

1144
01:34:22,240 --> 01:34:25,232
Ernest Teodor Amadeus Hoffman.

1145
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,358
It's been a hundred
years since his death

1146
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:32,430
but he remains a mystery up to this day.

1147
01:34:33,320 --> 01:34:35,231
A phenomenon.

1148
01:34:35,320 --> 01:34:37,311
Literature studies...

1149
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:46,238
Men, let's split up or we get sticks.

1150
01:34:46,360 --> 01:34:48,271
You know, at the end of my life

1151
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,390
I'll probably start going to the theatre.

1152
01:34:54,360 --> 01:34:56,430
How are the rehearsals going?

1153
01:34:59,320 --> 01:35:02,357
- Where are the actors?
- Having lunch. - Sorry?

1154
01:35:02,440 --> 01:35:04,396
Lunch break.

1155
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:08,316
It's cold here.

1156
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,276
I'll ask to bring some firewood.

1157
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:13,356
You know, my eyes are getting weak.

1158
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,311
Go to a doctor.

1159
01:35:18,240 --> 01:35:20,231
I want to talk to you.

1160
01:35:23,320 --> 01:35:26,392
Tomorrow is a conference
of the Writers' Union.

1161
01:35:27,360 --> 01:35:30,477
They will consider the manuscript
of "Forest of the Gods".

1162
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:33,356
They'll consider you, do you understand?

1163
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:35,436
I don't know if they permit to print it.

1164
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,311
It's not up to me.

1165
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:39,316
I know it's not up to you.

1166
01:35:39,360 --> 01:35:42,238
They've been considering
it for twelve months.

1167
01:35:42,280 --> 01:35:45,431
The editor has latched onto
the Polish word "vypirdaliaj".

1168
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:49,232
"Vypirdaliaj" is a common
word in the camp,

1169
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,349
just like "scheisse",

1170
01:35:50,400 --> 01:35:53,392
like "kurwamac". "Vypirdaliaj
litru samogona",

1171
01:35:53,440 --> 01:35:55,351
"Vszhyski zemby vypirdaliaj".

1172
01:35:55,400 --> 01:35:58,278
You have to understand
- it's not the words.

1173
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:01,312
You have your truth.
It's your truth, keep it.

1174
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:04,272
But you have to admit
that an artist's truth

1175
01:36:04,320 --> 01:36:06,311
might be subjective.

1176
01:36:07,320 --> 01:36:11,279
There is another truth. It is categorical.

1177
01:36:12,280 --> 01:36:16,432
It's almost a warning or
maybe even a judgment.

1178
01:36:18,360 --> 01:36:22,353
Your friends from Stutthof
have been sent to Siberia.

1179
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:24,391
By mistake.

1180
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:27,316
You also might be such a mistake.

1181
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,316
Do you understand?

1182
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:36,238
- Let's talk in the car. - What?

1183
01:36:36,360 --> 01:36:38,430
We'll talk in the car.

1184
01:36:39,400 --> 01:36:41,311
Let's go.

1185
01:38:03,440 --> 01:38:06,352
Friends, during the Great
War of Motherland

1186
01:38:06,400 --> 01:38:09,233
the talent of the United Nations' writers

1187
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,236
became a conception weapon

1188
01:38:11,280 --> 01:38:14,272
to defeat fascism that
instigates national hatred.

1189
01:38:14,320 --> 01:38:16,311
Friends, I'm amazed at the position

1190
01:38:16,360 --> 01:38:18,351
of the author of "Forest of the Gods".

1191
01:38:18,400 --> 01:38:21,312
He survived the hell of
fascism concentration camp

1192
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:24,432
but not a word is mentioned
about the resistance fight

1193
01:38:25,240 --> 01:38:27,356
which, as we all know, went on in there.

1194
01:38:27,400 --> 01:38:29,277
No smoking here.

1195
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:33,393
It can be claimed that the author
cynically mocks the German victims.

1196
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,351
The impression is that

1197
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:38,358
the very prisoners are
guilty for all the sufferings

1198
01:38:38,400 --> 01:38:40,356
but not the fascist butchers.

1199
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:43,392
The author hides behind
the apolitical mask,

1200
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:46,273
the so called humour of a hangman.

1201
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:49,357
This book is dangerous,
good for nothing, my friends!

1202
01:38:49,400 --> 01:38:53,279
We would do a favour
to our enemy if printed!

1203
01:39:18,360 --> 01:39:20,351
Hanged himself...

1204
01:39:22,360 --> 01:39:25,238
Son of a cunt.

1205
01:39:46,440 --> 01:39:48,431
Shoot all the Jews.

1206
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:52,354
Then kill Russians and
Poles, as soon as possible.

1207
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:55,517
You have twenty four hours
to eliminate the camp.

1208
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,311
Yes sir Standarterführer!

1209
01:40:56,360 --> 01:40:59,477
I wonder who comes first,
Russians or Americans.

1210
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:04,519
If the Russians, I have
to pin in the red star.

1211
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:08,312
If the Americans, then red doesn't fit.

1212
01:41:25,440 --> 01:41:27,476
Everything's all right.

1213
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,396
Welcome home.

1214
01:45:31,400 --> 01:45:33,516
I'm sorry, this is a front joke.

1215
01:45:58,480 --> 01:46:01,313
- Who's there? - The neighbour.

1216
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:05,357
Hello!

1217
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:10,319
Electricity frequently
goes off in this building.

1218
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:16,392
I want to give you an oil lamp, Professor.

1219
01:46:18,400 --> 01:46:19,549
It could be useful.

1220
01:46:20,320 --> 01:46:22,515
- You probably work a lot. - Thank you.

1221
01:46:44,400 --> 01:46:45,515
Sign.

1222
01:46:49,440 --> 01:46:53,399
I respect all beliefs and disbeliefs.

1223
01:46:54,480 --> 01:46:57,392
I just don't believe in sudden rebaptism.

1224
01:46:57,440 --> 01:47:01,353
Do you know how many change-overs

1225
01:47:01,400 --> 01:47:03,391
I saw in the camp?

1226
01:47:06,520 --> 01:47:09,512
You've announced the
crusade to your past.

1227
01:47:10,440 --> 01:47:12,476
Yes, you're the power people.

1228
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:14,515
I understand.

1229
01:47:15,320 --> 01:47:17,550
You have to agree, fawn upon
and no one will touch you.

1230
01:47:18,320 --> 01:47:21,357
Argue, go against and hell
knows what might happen.

1231
01:47:21,400 --> 01:47:25,439
But I don't believe all these
enthusiastic approvals.

1232
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:29,432
What's the essence of
all these speakers?

1233
01:47:29,480 --> 01:47:32,392
Began with clichés and
finished with clichés.

1234
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:34,431
I believe and let it be!

1235
01:47:35,320 --> 01:47:37,515
A conference of the Writers' Union!

1236
01:47:37,560 --> 01:47:39,516
Not a single creative thought,

1237
01:47:40,320 --> 01:47:43,357
no communication, no
creative discussions!

1238
01:47:45,360 --> 01:47:47,430
Creators have always created

1239
01:47:47,480 --> 01:47:50,517
and always destroyed
theories from the essence.

1240
01:47:50,560 --> 01:47:53,313
Why am I telling you all this?

1241
01:47:54,480 --> 01:47:56,471
You understand it yourself.

1242
01:47:58,360 --> 01:48:00,476
Every creator creates what he saw,

1243
01:48:00,520 --> 01:48:03,512
how he perceived the
world. One's own way!

1244
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:09,393
"Forest of the Gods", it's
such an innocent subject!

1245
01:48:10,480 --> 01:48:12,471
I wrote it in two months.

1246
01:48:14,360 --> 01:48:16,430
The discussion took twelve months!

1247
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:19,313
Discussion, discussion, discussion!

1248
01:48:20,320 --> 01:48:22,311
And it's not the end yet!

1249
01:48:25,400 --> 01:48:27,436
It's clear for me though.

1250
01:48:29,440 --> 01:48:31,510
I'm starting to hate this piece.

1251
01:48:33,440 --> 01:48:37,319
I don't want to see it, I
don't want to hear about it.

1252
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:40,356
"Forest of the Gods".

1253
01:48:40,400 --> 01:48:42,436
You are all looking for politics

1254
01:48:43,360 --> 01:48:45,510
and get angry when you don't find it.

1255
01:48:46,320 --> 01:48:48,311
I didn't write any.

1256
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:53,512
If all these people stayed in the camp

1257
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:56,554
for as long as I'd been,

1258
01:48:57,320 --> 01:49:00,471
with legs swollen, kidneys beaten,

1259
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:06,477
heads smashed, starving,

1260
01:49:08,400 --> 01:49:10,436
scrambling for a piece of bread,

1261
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:14,519
they'd understand that a person in
a camp no longer thinks of politics.

1262
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:17,311
The most important thing is to survive.

1263
01:49:17,400 --> 01:49:19,470
To survive, to survive, to survive!

1264
01:49:21,480 --> 01:49:24,358
To write what never was...

1265
01:49:26,440 --> 01:49:28,396
What I never saw,

1266
01:49:29,520 --> 01:49:33,354
to brag about my sufferings.
...I don't want this.

1267
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:35,470
I don't want to and don't know how.

1268
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:39,354
When the firewood arrives,
give them this note.

1269
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:47,312
Good people!

1270
01:49:49,320 --> 01:49:51,436
Let this old bison die.

1271
01:49:54,320 --> 01:49:56,356
You're an influential man.

1272
01:49:57,320 --> 01:49:59,356
I should be afraid of you.

1273
01:50:01,320 --> 01:50:04,517
You know what, from this same office

1274
01:50:05,440 --> 01:50:09,319
I was sent to the camp,
only by a German officer.

1275
01:50:31,480 --> 01:50:33,357
Who's there?

1276
01:50:34,320 --> 01:50:35,389
Me.

1277
01:50:35,440 --> 01:50:36,509
Who's "me"?

1278
01:50:37,320 --> 01:50:38,469
Me, me.

1279
01:50:40,480 --> 01:50:42,436
Ah, Professor.

1280
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:46,392
Good day. Came to say goodbye?

1281
01:50:48,360 --> 01:50:51,511
Yes, yes, they closed your camp.

1282
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:55,396
Completely closed.

1283
01:50:57,400 --> 01:50:59,470
We'll keep performing, but...

1284
01:51:00,480 --> 01:51:02,516
Will perform something.

1285
01:51:06,480 --> 01:51:09,313
Maybe it's good they've closed it.

1286
01:51:11,480 --> 01:51:14,358
Who needs a performance?

1287
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:19,439
About a live mouse in the
teeth of a painted cat?

1288
01:51:22,480 --> 01:51:25,517
I don't know if it's even
possible to perform.

1289
01:51:39,480 --> 01:51:41,436
Who is he?

1290
01:51:42,480 --> 01:51:44,516
I know him.

1291
01:51:45,480 --> 01:51:49,314
That's Manfred Freiwald.
From Lauenburg.

1292
01:51:50,320 --> 01:51:53,312
A German, the researcher of the Bible.

1293
01:51:54,320 --> 01:51:56,470
Worked in the library of the SS.

1294
01:51:57,400 --> 01:52:00,437
Yes, that's Manferd Freiwald.

1295
01:52:01,400 --> 01:52:03,516
Later transferred to the sawmill.

1296
01:52:07,400 --> 01:52:09,470
Was terribly afraid of death.

1297
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:15,436
He hid in the hospital when he found out

1298
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:17,391
he was to be shot.

1299
01:52:17,480 --> 01:52:19,516
He died when he fell off the scaffolding

1300
01:52:20,320 --> 01:52:22,311
while building a boiler.

1301
01:52:22,480 --> 01:52:25,438
No, that's a Russian from the sixth block.

1302
01:52:25,480 --> 01:52:27,436
He wanted to escape.

1303
01:52:29,360 --> 01:52:34,434
He tried to escape in spring,
they caught and shot him.

1304
01:52:36,360 --> 01:52:37,475
So that's life.

1305
01:52:37,520 --> 01:52:40,353
So why is he walking
here if he was shot?

1306
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:43,392
Gentlemen, this is
Mr. Professor, a Lithuanian.

1307
01:52:43,440 --> 01:52:46,432
A book rat from the administrative office.

1308
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:50,517
They say he wrote a book
about the camp after the war.

1309
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:55,358
But nobody would print it.

1310
01:52:55,480 --> 01:52:57,436
