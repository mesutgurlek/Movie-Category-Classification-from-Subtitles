00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:09,200
I ain't in the mood for a game of grab ass,cowboy.

2
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,000
You hear me?

3
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,800
- put it on my account.
- On your tab.

4
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:38,100
- hey,rox.
- Hey there,handsome.

5
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,800
I thought your leave was over.

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,500
It was.But then I got to thinng
once I got back on post.

7
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,700
- Roxy?
- Thinking, huh?

8
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,000
- Uh-oh.
- I know.

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,800
Did you know it takes
exactly 7 hours and 58 minutes

10
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:55,400
to drive from charleston to tuscaloosa?

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,100
Does it now?

12
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:59,300
Jake,paws off the tap.

13
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,100
Roxy...

14
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,500
you work two jobs, right?

15
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,500
And you got two kids from two different men.

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,100
Now I know I only met you four days ago,

17
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,400
but I think you're my soul mate.

18
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,100
- hey,roxy--
- not now.

19
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:17,900
And I decided I want you to marry me.

20
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,000
Well,are you asking me?

21
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,200
Yes.

22
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:27,000
Then ask me.

23
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,900
Roxy,will you marry me?

24

31
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:12,500
They're flying.

32
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
this is it, baby.
This is our new home.

33
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,400
Come here.

34
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,100
Hi!

35
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:35,700
aw.

36
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,300
Darn it.

37
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:43,800
It's a chit for letting the lawn grow too high.

38
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:46,800
- We haven't even moved in yet.
- I know.

39
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,300
They got strict rules around here.

40
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,500
Hell,where I'm from,the lawn's for car parts.

41
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,900
Look...I'm sorry,
but it's all we gonna get for now.

42
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,700
But I promise you it'S...

43
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,900
- this is more than we have ever had.Okay?
- Yeah?

44
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,400
Thank you.

45
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:31,600
Claudia joy holden...

46
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:35,900
after 17 years of marriage, my heart still
skips a beat every time I look at you.

47
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,100
Michael james holden...

48
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,400
after 17 years of marriage, I can't believe
that tired old line of yours still works.

49
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,300
Tell me.

50
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,800
Well,that promotion should be yours tonight,
not colonel baker'S.

51
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:02,100
Promotions are all about politics,claudia.
You know that.

52
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,400
- Ah.
- They played a better game and they won.

53
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,800
They cheated.

54
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:08,200
That is not playing a better game.That'S...

55
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,100
it's cheating.

56
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,400
There will be other opportunities.

57
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,000
All right,but I don't like it.

58
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:32,600
you know,you could make one that vibrates,
give us a little something to look forward to.

59
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,700
Don't think you're the first one to suggest it.

60
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:39,600
Everything looks good.
The babies are measuring right on target.

61
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,700
- You wanna know gender?
- Uh, no.

62
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,500
Just give me two copies, please.

63
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,000
- see you next week?
- I'll bring the wine.

64
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,400
you're ten minutes late for curfew.

65
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,100
sorry, sir.It won't happen again.

66
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,000
That's not good enough,son.

67
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:18,500
You made a commitment to be home by 1800 hours.
You keep your word.

68
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,300
You stand up when I'm talking to you.

69
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,500
Jeremy,you are 17 years old.

70
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:23,900
It is time to be a man.

71
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,600
Keep your commitments
or you will never become an officer.

72
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,000
You're dismissed.

73
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:40,800
You're leaving tomorrow,and it's hard on him...

74
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,300
obeying you now and then
listening to me when you're gone.

75
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,500
Well,just don't coddle him.

76
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,100
You're just gonna get him
killed somewhere down the line.

77
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,500
Soldiers,please rise for a toast to
the president of the united states.

78
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,700
- Hey,what are you doing?
- I'm looking for the president.

79
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,600
- Baby,he's not coming.
- To the president of the united states.

80
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,400
to the president.

81
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,900
The president of the united
states has reposed special trust and confidence

82
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:27,500
in the abilities of colonel theodore H.Baker.

83
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:31,900
He is therefore promoted to
the rank of brigadier general.

84
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:45,700
how'd you shoot today?

85
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,800
I cleaned up to 600 yards,
but then I pulled a few after that.

86
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:55,500
Good,but I'm not sure if it was good enough.

87
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,400
I told you,honey.You gotta loosen up.

88
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,400
You tend to lock your forearm,
and it throws off your aim.

89
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:03,500
Okay,I know.Can you not do that here,please?

90
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:08,500
- I had an ultrasound today.
- I know.

91
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,600
You could show up to one of them.

92
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,800
Let's not talk about that right now.

93
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:19,700
I'm just saying it looks funny,you know,
my husband never being there.

94
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,400
Well,I have to train,pamela.
I can't do both.

95
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,100
At ease,both of you.

96
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,200
- I wasn't supposed to do that,was I?
- No, ma'am.

97
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,400
- I'm roxy, his wife.
- Mrs. Leblanc.Major sherwood.

98
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,500
Now rumor has it you wanna be a paratrooper.
Is that correct, soldier?

99
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,100
- It is, sir.
- Rumors have a way of coming true.

100
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,100
You start training tomorrow morning at 0600.

101
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,200
Enjoy your evening,both of you.

102
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,600
You,too,sir.

103
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:01,200
Well,if I didn't just serve
up toe jam on an idiot cracker.

104
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,000
Don't worry about it, honey.
You didn't know.

105
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,300
Did you hear what he just said?

106
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,400
I start my paratrooper training tomorrow, 0600.

107
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,700
I didn't even know major sherwood knew who I was.

108
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,100
Now come on.

109
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,000
oh, damn it to hell.

110
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,400
god.

111
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,000
right, right.

112
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,000
All right, you know what?I gotta go back in.

113
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
he's gonna be wondering where we are.

114
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,700
Frank's leaving tomorrow,isn't he?

115
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:39,300
- Mm-hmm, three months.The middle east.
- I know.

116
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,400
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

117
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,300
Oh.

118
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,600
- What?
- N-nothing.It'S...

119
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,000
- denise,did someone hurt you?
- No, of course not.

120
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,700
- It's just a bruise.
- This is more than just a bruise.

121
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:57,100
It's nothing, really.I was a nurse.Remember?

122
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,900
You were in nursing school,
and that was 18 years ago.

123
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,700
What's going on here?

124
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,600
no need for tears,ladies.

125
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:23,900
Got it at the goodwill.

126
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:30,300
mrs. Holden.Mrs. Sherwood.

127
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:47,300
Looks like I got here just
in time for the 8:00 show.

128
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,000
hey.

129
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,900
He hits you once,hit him back.

130
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:58,100
He hits you a second time, shoot him in the balls.

131
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,300
Okay, the men's room...

132
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,200
it's downright boring.

133
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,900
- it's mrs.Baker,isn't it?
- Oh, lenore, please.

134
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:22,700
Lenore, I realize we don't
know each other very well,

135
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,600
but,uh,you spread a rumor that my husband,
michael holden,is racist.

136
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:32,200
My husband lost his promotion
to yours because of it.

137
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,900
Sweetheart,you've made a mistake.

138
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,700
Please think of something
you can do to make it better.

139
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,900
claudia joy,what did you just say
to the brigadier general's wife?

140
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:54,600
You would never stand for someone spreading
a lie to get a promotion,michael james,

141
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:57,500
and neither will I.

142
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,200
You know there'll be consequences,don't you?

143
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,000
I can handle lenore baker.

144
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,900
Let's go get some pie.

145
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,200
Oh!When are they due, honey?

146
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,500
Uh,it's pamela.

147
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,900
Uh, uh, about another month and a half.

148
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,500
- Do you know their sexes?
- We don't wanna say.

149
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,000
Come on now.We won't tell anyone.

150
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,900
Excuse me, ma'am.

151
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:25,600
I never liked her.She always acts like
she's better than the rest of us.

152
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,600
Well,I heard she's dealing percocet.

153
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:30,100
Is that how they got that new truck?

154
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:38,100
Did you know that gossip,because it
enhances our understanding of human nature,

155
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,400
was once considered a virtue?

156
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,700
"Enhances our understanding"?

157
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:47,700
- What are you,a shrink?
- I am.That's a nice call.

158
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:50,300
- So you're not military?
- Oh, no.

159
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,100
My wife joan is.She's a lieutenant colonel.

160
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:56,200
- Is that good?
- It's very good.

161
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,700
How you holding up, burton?

162
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,300
Two years is a long time to be gone.

163
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,300
- It is.A lot of things have changed.
- Yeah.

164
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:07,700
They had me fill out a post-deployment checklist.

165
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,800
we call those the "don't kill your spouse"
questionnaire.

166
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,300
They started after desert storm,you know,

167
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,800
all those domestic violence cases.

168
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,400
Can I ask you something?

169
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:23,100
You bet.

170
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,200
How long before everything feels normal again?

171
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,100
It never does...

172
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,000
not really.

173
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:41,900
Joan?

174
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,900
The place is clearing out.Ready to go?

175
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,900
of course.

176
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:49,400
- Good evening, holden.
- Burton.

177
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,700
My first jump was at night,
free-falling 120 miles per hour.

178
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,900
Man,it was so loud.

179
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,300
You couldn't even hear your own thoughts.
And then...

180
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,400
my parachute rips open, right?

181
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,100
And suddenly it was so quiet,

182
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,900
and I'm floatin' down and I'm thinking to myself,

183
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,600
man,what a great ride my life is.

184
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:19,200
And,rox,the best part about this
is they're paying me to jump now.

185
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,500
Private first class trevor leblanc starts
paratrooper training tomorrow morning, 0600.

186
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:25,500
Yep.

187
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,600
why don't you jump on in here,big boy,
see if you can open my parachute?

188
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:31,600
- Maybe I will.
- Maybe you will.

189
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,100
Maybe I will.

190
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,000
mom?

191
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,700
Mom?

192
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,500
Finn's throwing up.

193
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:43,700
I'm sorry, hon.It's crazy in here.
We're doing everything possible.

194
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,500
Please, as soon as you can?My boy's real sick.

195
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:49,000
Myyes, ma'am.I will.

196
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,400
another U.S.Helicopter was shot down last night,

197
00:14:57,500 --> 00:15:00,400
killing all eight american soldiers on board.

198
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:04,700
The soldiers from the 23rd airborne
division located at fort marshall

199
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:10,500
were responding to the deaths of four american
soldiers by mortar fire that occurred the day before.

200
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,800
The new violence comes days after two other
U.S.Special forces operatives were killed...

201
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,100
hey, baby.

202
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,500
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?

203
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,800
Are you sure?

204
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,400
If you have to jump out of a perfectly
good airplane in a couple of hours,

205
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,000
I want one of us to be awake.

206
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,300
Okay.

207
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:53,500
a c-17 military transport aircraft carrying the
bodies of 14 american soldiers killed in action

208
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,200
in afghanistan landed today at an
american military base in germany.

209
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:01,100
The soldiers were killed by
a rocket-propelled grenade...

210
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,300
go with me.

211
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,800
- He said to go over here.
- Okay.

212
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,500
enlisted management,call tricare office...

213
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,900
- joyce.
- Hi, good morning.

214
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Good morning.

215
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,000
My daughter needs a physical before
her cheerleading practice today.

216
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,300
Now I hate to put you in this position.

217
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,000
Can you possibly fit her in before school starts?

218
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:23,000
Oh, of course, claudia joy.I'd be happy to.

219
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,900
Great.I appreciate it.

220
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:27,200
- Mary, can you take them back with--
- excuse me.

221
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,700
- Hi.
- Hi.

222
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,100
It's me,from last night in the restroom?Thong?

223
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,700
Of course.Good morning.

224
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Good morning, yeah.

225
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,800
I was wondering
if you could help me with something.

226
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,000
See,I'm the new girl around here,

227
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,200
and I don't have my army wives decoder ring yet

228
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:45,100
to sweet-talk my way through
those magic blue doors.

229
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:48,900
Although I definitely don't want your
daughter to miss a single "go, fight, win,"

230
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,400
we've been here since 4:00 in the morning,

231
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,000
and my boy just threw up on the
rolling stones here for the third time.

232
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,400
And I was wondering
if you could tell me who I have to...

233
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,000
who I have to get busy with
around here to see a doctor?

234
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,400
What's your name?

235
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Roxy.Roxy leblanc.

236
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:16,500
Joyce,uh,would you please allow mrs. Leblanc
and her son to take our place?

237
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,600
Mrs. Leblanc,you can go right on in.

238
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,300
Thank you.

239
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,400
- But,mom,I need to--
- emmalin,sit down.

240
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:28,400
Come on,honey.

241
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,300
This way.Hurry.Come on, come on.

242
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,600
I used to be a cop like my dad,my brothers.

243
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:43,900
But I married chase,and soldiers
don't like their wives to work,so I quit.

244
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,100
How'd you feel about that?

245
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,900
Ugh.I hated it at first.

246
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,200
I was a good cop.

247
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,400
Plus we went into debt.

248
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:58,000
So when things got really bad,
I became a surrogate.

249
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:03,400
The plan is to say that the babies died
after we give 'em to their real parents.

250
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:08,200
But how do I just lie to everyone,even my kids?

251
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,600
Maybe you should tell everyone the truth.

252
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,100
I can'T.

253
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:19,400
They'd ruin chase if they found out.

254
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,400
Pamela.

255
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,800
Ask her.

256
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,500
Pamela moran,can I have a word with you?

257
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:42,000
Sorry,I'm all out of percocet,
but I got some vicodin in the trunk.

258
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,300
Drugs.I knew it.

259
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:47,000
- Is that how you seduced our chaplain?
- What the hell,marilyn?

260
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,500
You know me.
We made brownies all year together for the P.T.A.

261
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,000
Does seducing the chaplain sound
like something that I would do?

262
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,300
Oh,I think we all know what you would do,pamela.

263
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,300
The question is,what would jesus do?

264
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,000
Why,he would smack you across the face.

265
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,500
all right,jeremy,I'm gonna be
checkin' my e-mail every chance I get,

266
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:43,400
so let me know about west point
when we get word,all right?

267
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:44,500
Yes, sir.

268
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,400
All right now,
you're the man of the house while I'm gone.

269
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,300
Dad,I've been the man of the house since I was 7.

270
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:51,100
All right.

271
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,200
Well,I expect you to act like it,all right?

272
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,400
Now don't disappoint me.

273
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:01,900
hey, D.

274
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,800
- I get teased about these,you know.
- I know.

275
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,700
But that all stopped
when I actually read one out loud,

276
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,100
and now all the soldiers want
love notes from their wives.

277
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:19,400
Your medication's in your bag,
left side pocket.Twice a day.

278
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,300
There's some--some gum in there,and,uh,

279
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,000
batteries,too,
'cause they never give you enough batteries.

280
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,500
No fear,all right?

281
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,800
It's bad luck.

282
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,000
- all right,let's get 'em on the buses.
- Yes, sir!

283
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,800
All right, head out!

284
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,490
come on, let's go.

285
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,590
No wait, jeremy.
Let's watch his bus leave.

286
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,990
He's gone.Let's go.

287
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:21,190
*For the lead and the dregs of my bed*

288
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:26,890
*I've been sleeping for the later pade*

289
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,590
my god, that's what it says on the door.

290
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:34,690
Come in.

291
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,790
Do you want some fruit cocktail?Juice?

292
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,990
What's this?

293
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,190
It's a tv set, mommy.

294
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,390
I know it's a tv set, katie.

295
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,790
What I want to know is, why is it on my wall?

296
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,090
Well, it's a present.

297
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,890
It's the ferrari of plasma tvs,
mom, and it plays H.D.

298
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:52,390
And it's ours because why?

299
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,290
'cause daddy's in delta force!

300
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,890
I unlocked my forearm like you told me,

301
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:03,190
and I made the kill shot at 780 yards.

302
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:05,090
Okay, mommy needs to talk to daddy for a minute,

303
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,190
so go to your rooms and play, okay?

304
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,290
What is it?

305
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,890
we can't keep spending like this.

306
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,290
I haven't even paid my father back yet.

307
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,790
Didn't you hear what I just said?

308
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,390
I'm in.

309
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,190
Can't you be happy for me for once?

310
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,190
I'm sorry.I am.I'm so proud of you.
It's huge.

311
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,290
But still, we can't be buying plasma tvs.

312
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:28,590
Pull yourself together!

313
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,690
Plus how does that look?

314
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,990
Besides, I-I want to talk about a new plan.

315
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,790
Look, we had an agreement, pamela.

316
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:36,190
- An agreement?
- An agreement.

317
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,590
Now you're trying to change things in

318
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,090
because you're having some kind of moral dilemma?

319
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,690
Don't mess this up for me.

320
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,390
I mean it.

321
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,290
You know, you've taken on a lot here.

322
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,290
The black fact is we're broke.

323
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,190
I need to do my part, get a job.

324
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,290
I told you I'm gonna take care of you.

325
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:00,790
Now come on.D-fac.

326
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,190
A factory?

327
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,390
Mess hall.

328
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,790
Right.Right.

329
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,990
Well, how do you get mess hall out of that, T.J.?

330
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:11,290
"D," dining, "fac," facility, equals mess hall.

331
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,790
A.C.U.

332
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,690
Does everything have to be in initials?

333
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,990
They're called acronyms, mom.

334
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:19,490
Watch that tongue.

335
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,190
Well, you might as well answer, toby jack.

336
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,690
Army combat uniform.

337
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,490
What's a jody?

338
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:29,690
A jody is a bad guy who hooks up
with all the mommies

339
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:31,490
when the daddies are at war.

340
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,290
- No, no, no.
- Hey, hey, hey!

341
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,990
Two words--e-nough.

342
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,690
did you see this?

343
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,890
It's an invitation to an afternoon tea.

344
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,190
I don't wear white gloves and I don't take tea.

345
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:49,090
I'm never gonna fit in here, trevor.

346
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,190
We fit, rox.That's all that matters.

347
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,990
I can't even iron your shirt.

348
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,990
Well, you have to go slow, ease into it.

349
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,990
On the crease...like that.

350
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:18,290
like that.

351
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:32,990
oh, I get it.You're gonna show me how to do it, huh?

352
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:45,590
gonna get rid of 'em, then we're gonna...

353
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,990
iron some more.

354
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,290
Oh, you like that?

355
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,890
I'll just put this on.

356
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,490
Hey.

357
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,790
We're the welcoming committee.

358
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,490
We don't have fruitcakes, but,
uh, we do have ladies' night.

359
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,790
I'm candace, and this here's jamie lynne.

360
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,490
- Hi, there.
- Hi.I'm roxy.

361
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,190
Hey.Well, grab your purse.Come on.

362
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,290
Thank y'all for coming around, but, uh,

363
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,190
I've got my husband and my kids,
so I can't really go out.

364
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,690
Rox.

365
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,990
Go.I got 'em.

366
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,390
You need to go make friends,
especially when I'm gone.

367
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,990
Go on.

368
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,390
- just give me...
- cool.

369
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,190
why'd we leave the base?

370
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,290
Post, honey.

371
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,990
Navy, marines, they have bases.

372
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,990
Army has posts, and, uh, we've got
much better pickings off-post.

373
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,190
My eyes like what they see.

374
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,090
I thought you were married.

375
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,190
I am.

376
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,390
I'm just not a fanatic about it.

377
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,590
Her man's been gone for over a year now.

378
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,990
So y'all come here to hook up?

379
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,790
Rubber and batteries only last you so long.

380
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,290
hold on,

381
00:25:53,300 --> 00:25:54,290
help wanted

382
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,590
Where you going?

383
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,690
I think I belong behind the bar.

384
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,790
Oh, you can't work in a jody bar.

385
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,690
No soldier's gonna go for that.

386
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:05,590
How you gonna keep a marriage?

387
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,190
I'll keep it just fine.

388
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,390
I'm kind of a fanatic about it.

389
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,990
All right I'd like an application.

390
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,290
What's a big hot hooter?

391
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:18,290
Do you mind?

392
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:25,290
big hot hooter--1 ounce tequila,
3/4ths ounce amaretto.

393
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,390
Fill it up with pineapple juice.

394
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:31,090
Top it off with grenadine,
and every hooter needs a nipple,

395
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:34,890
so of course, don't forget your cherry on top.

396
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,390
Big hot hooter.

397
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,690
Are you a drinker?

398
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,590
Don't worry.

399
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,990
Alcoholics, like blue eyes, run in my family.

400
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,390
I'm just lucky I skipped that gene.

401
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,490
Jeremy?

402
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,190
it's from west point.

403
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,290
- I got in.
- That is great, honey.

404
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,890
Wait a minute.

405
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,290
Did dad have anything to do with this?

406
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,590
No.

407
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,890
I-I don't think so.

408
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,790
Wait, you don't think so?

409
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:17,590
You did this on your own, jeremy.

410
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,590
He may have made a call,
but--but in the end, it's all you.

411
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,290
He may have made a call?

412
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,790
I knew it.

413
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:27,690
I chose west point because he didn't go there.

414
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:31,290
I wanted to do one thing by myself, but no.

415
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,590
Honey-- now everyone will know the only reason

416
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,990
I got in is because I'm major
frank sherwood's son.

417
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,790
Jeremy.

418
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,290
jeremy, why do you keep doing this?

419
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,290
I'm sorry.I didn't mean it.

420
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:53,290
If your father knew what you were doing,

421
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,490
yeah, but you know what?

422
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:55,990
You're not gonna tell him,

423
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:00,190
'cause that would just ruin your
image of being the perfect little wife and mother.

424
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,490
when did it start?

425
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:06,890
Six months ago.

426
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:10,790
Every time frank would leave or
was about to return, there was something.

427
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:14,190
Only this ek, it started before he left.

428
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,590
Has frank ever hit you

429
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,190
oh, god, no.He would never hit a woman.

430
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,290
Why didn't you tell frank about it?

431
00:28:20,300 --> 00:28:22,290
I didn't want to upset him.

432
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:29,090
Denise, listen, I hope you're not blaming yourself.

433
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,690
It is not your fault.

434
00:28:30,700 --> 00:28:33,090
How could i not blame myself?

435
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,090
I mean, sometimes I think, how did I even get here?

436
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:40,990
I raised a son who hurts his own mother.

437
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,990
- sweetie.
- no, pace yourself.

438
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:57,390
- Hey, how you doing?
- Not interested...

439
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,990
ma'am.

440
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:07,890
I'd, uh, offer you a refill,
but you being a soldier and all...

441
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:09,990
how'd you know that?

442
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,890
Nobody calls me "ma'am" except soldiers
and boys looking to get laid.

443
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:19,290
I need another drink.

444
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,790
Okay.

445
00:29:22,100 --> 00:29:24,390
So you just get back or shippin' out?

446
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:28,390
Just got back from afghanistan.

447
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,590
Must've been tough, you being a
female soldier and all.

448
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,390
I'm a lieutenant colonel.
I have over 400 men in my command.

449
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,290
You must've seen quite a lot then.

450
00:29:48,400 --> 00:29:50,690
you got into west point.You should be excited.

451
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,090
I'm not.

452
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:55,090
I thought I wanted this,
but the more I think about it...

453
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,890
don't you ever feel like your
whole life is about the military?

454
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,990
You know, 0800 hours, curfews--

455
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,790
oh, yeah, did dad die today?

456
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:04,890
Yeah.

457
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:07,790
Sometimes I feel like my dad's
just some guy I see in a video.

458
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,490
- Exactly.
- Gentlemen.Ladies.

459
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:12,090
Oh, my god, it's my dad.

460
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,590
emmalin, get in the car, please.

461
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,390
I'll be there in a minute.

462
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,290
- Jeremy, can I speak to you privately?
- Yes, sir.

463
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,390
Congratulations on getting into west point.

464
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:25,190
Thank you, sir.

465
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,990
Happy to call on your behalf.

466
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:27,890
Thank you, sir.

467
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,590
I wouldn't have done that if I knew
you were hitting your mother.

468
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:35,290
It's unfortunate that your father isn't
here to handle this himself.

469
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:39,090
The military has a code of honor,
jeremy, and it's nonnegotiable.

470
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,790
You do not hit women.

471
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,490
If it happens again, I won't warn you.

472
00:30:44,500 --> 00:30:45,490
I will find you,

473
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:47,790
and I will treat you like any other
adult man who hit a woman.

474
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,290
Do you understand me?

475
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,890
Yes, sir.

476
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:52,790
Good.

477
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:27,490
Okay, move it, move it!

478
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,290
Back it up!

479
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:29,790
All right.

480
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,790
I think it's time for you to
get down now.Let's go.

481
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,990
Okay.Don't worry about it.Come on.Turn around.

482
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:39,490
Okay, okay.All right.Go.

483
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,190
uh, excuse me.

484
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,390
Someone called about my wife?

485
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,890
- You're roland, joan's husband?
- Yes.

486
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:07,190
And you're a bartender in a jody bar.

487
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,590
Yeah.

488
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:10,790
Good to see you again.

489
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:12,590
She's back there.

490
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,490
Thank you.

491
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:39,090
wake up

492
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,190
come on.

493
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,990
come on

494
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,590
What I did over there...

495
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:02,990
if you knew, you wouldn't love me.

496
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,890
I don't care what you did.

497
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,390
It doesn't matter to me.

498
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,690
I know who you are.

499
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,190
supporting our troops really is a great cause.

500
00:33:24,900 --> 00:33:26,090
Anyway, it's good to see you.

501
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:28,990
- What a wonderful party.
- Thank you, enjoy.

502
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,290
Okay.Enjoy it.Okay.

503
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,890
- I just can't thank you enough for inviting me.
- Hi.

504
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,090
I know this is a fund-raiser,

505
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:37,890
and that's the only reason

506
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:42,190
all the rest of us are invited to one of
your famous tea parties, but whatever.

507
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:45,090
I can't believe I'm meeting claudia joy holden.

508
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,490
Oh, don't be silly.

509
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,390
What's your name again, hon?

510
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,990
Marilyn, and, uh, this is angie.

511
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:49,990
- Hi.
- Hi.

512
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,890
I'm married to a sergeant in the 23rd division.

513
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,390
Thank you so much for inviting me.

514
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,590
Absolutely.

515
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,290
Excellent.

516
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,490
- Enjoy.
- Okay.

517
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,390
These little teas are always
such a good boost for our egos,

518
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,690
aren't they, sweetheart?

519
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,290
I'm so glad you came, lenore.

520
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:10,990
Oh, I wouldn't miss it,

521
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:13,290
not after all I've been learning about you

522
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,690
-- born to upper-class parents,

523
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:21,390
about to graduate harvard law with honors
until you suddenly dropped out.

524
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,690
Now why would you do that?

525
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,790
Waylaid by love, of course.

526
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,390
How quaint.

527
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:29,790
I look forward to learning more.

528
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,290
Denise.

529
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,890
- Oh, honey.
- Thank god you're here.

530
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:41,590
You invited lenore baker?

531
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:43,590
I know.

532
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,690
okay.

533
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,190
Glad you came.

534
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,290
Well, I had to show off my new look.

535
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,990
Thank you for what you and michael did.

536
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,090
Of course.Whatever you need.

537
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,490
How's it going with jeremy?

538
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,390
He's not speaking to me,
but, um, no new incidents so far.

539
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:04,090
- Hey, guys.
- Hey, roland.

540
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:07,690
You are such a good sport to show
up to these wives-only tea parties.

541
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,190
Well, being surrounded by women isn't all that bad.

542
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,190
How's joan?

543
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:15,990
Sometimes it can be hard for
them when they come back.

544
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:21,190
We're still just, um,
getting reacquainted, you know?

545
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,390
- oh, my.
- oh, my gosh.

546
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:31,290
- oh, uh, if, uh, you'll excuse me?
- oh,yeah

547
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,790
roxy, hi.Welcome to my home.

548
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,990
Thank you, but I can't stay.
I have to be at work in half an hour.

549
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,390
That's okay.Come say hi for a minute.

550
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:44,290
They're gonna be talking about my
outfit for weeks, aren't they?

551
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,590
Well...

552
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,090
yes, they are.

553
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,790
- Hey, roland.
- Roxy.

554
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,290
Uh, denise sherwood.
You met at the promotion ceremony.

555
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,390
Somebody better be missing their balls.

556
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,790
Um, pamela moran.I want you to meet her.

557
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,290
Pamela.

558
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,690
Here's a gal I think you should meet.

559
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,390
This is roxy leblanc.

560
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,990
She and her husband have children about
the same age as yours.

561
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,490
- So talk it up.
- Thank you.

562
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,090
of course.

563
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,090
You're sitting next to the antichrist--

564
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:16,290
going to hell by association.

565
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,190
Oh, I reckon I got you beat on the hell front.

566
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,090
Last week, I was a drug dealer,

567
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:27,490
and this week, I'm carrying the chaplain's kids.

568
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,590
you think you can top that?

569
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,190
I can try.

570
00:36:31,600 --> 00:36:33,190
My kids aren't my husband'S.

571
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:36,390
I was married to the first one's daddy
until he sucker-punched me.

572
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:40,790
Second one's dad was just a friend who
came over to comfort me one night.

573
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,390
I've known trevor, my husband,
for all of 17 days now.

574
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,090
How'd I do?

575
00:36:46,300 --> 00:36:48,290
I'm impressed.

576
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,490
What is it?

577
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,790
I think it's the scones.

578
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:58,390
okay.Your water broke, baby.

579
00:36:58,700 --> 00:36:59,790
Yeah, you think?

580
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:00,890
Okay, we gotta call your husband.

581
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,990
No, we can'T.He's in training at delta force.

582
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,090
You're gonna deliver.

583
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,990
Look, I'm in a bit of a mess.
These aren't my kids.

584
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,590
I'm--I'm a paid surrogate.

585
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,590
We can't go to the post hospital.

586
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:12,390
Everybody's gonna gossip.
You gotta get me outta here.

587
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,390
Okay.Okay.

588
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,390
Okay.Stay here.Be right back.

589
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,390
I'll show you when I get a second,
maybe later on today.This...

590
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,790
I need you.Now.

591
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:27,590
Gorgeous, uh, steam shower
with some blue and cream tile...

592
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:33,890
you're dilated about 4 centimeters.

593
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,290
oh, my.

594
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:39,090
Where's the nearest hospital-- off-post?

595
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,990
Off-post?

596
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,290
- st.Luke'S.
- But that's about 40 minutes away.

597
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,990
Then let's go!

598
00:37:48,700 --> 00:37:51,290
Roland!We need a ride.

599
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,290
- Open the door.
- Yeah.

600
00:37:58,300 --> 00:38:00,090
Here you go.

601
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,690
You in?Okay.

602
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,990
Who is that?

603
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:04,890
He's a shrink.

604
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,190
He's a doctor, and he has a big car.

605
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,090
Hi, I'm roland.Where to?

606
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,090
we're going to st.Luke'S.

607
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,590
Looks like we got more women gettin' into my car.

608
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,890
Let's go.We got babies to deliver.

609
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:27,890
- Relax.
- Relax?

610
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:29,690
I know. Try, okay?We're with you.

611
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,790
Oh, mother...

612
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,790
She's about to crown.
We are not gonna make it to st.Luke'S.

613
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,390
Don't push, pamela.Don'T.

614
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,190
Oh, I can't have these
babies in the backseat of a car!

615
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,890
I am not 15 and working at a dairy queen!

616
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,090
Hey, roland, see that fireworks sign?

617
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,690
Pull in right after it.

618
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,390
the bar?I'm giving birth in a bar?

619
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,390
it's better than a dairy queen, baby.

620
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,190
Everybody out.Let's get her up.
Come on.let's go.

621
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:10,290
Keep breathing.Keep breathing.

622
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:13,290
This is not how I agined this day.

623
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,890
Oh, but here we are, sweetheart.

624
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,790
All right, and push, two, three, four...

625
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,090
five, six...

626
00:39:21,100 --> 00:39:23,690
vodka and a hammer!
I need vodka and a hammer.

627
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,290
Got it.Got it.Got it.

628
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,390
I want you to look at me.

629
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,990
No, wait.She shouldn't have that.

630
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:30,690
Hey!

631
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:35,690
push, two, three, four, five!

632
