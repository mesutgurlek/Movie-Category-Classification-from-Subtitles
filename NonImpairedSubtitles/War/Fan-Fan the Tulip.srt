1
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,148
<i>Once upon a time there was
a wonderful land called France.</i>

2
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,672
<i>Through the spyglass,
you see the 18th century in full swing.</i>

3
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,633
<i>The people were happy,
the women easy,</i>

4
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,718
<i>and men indulged
war.</i>

5
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,433
<i>The only sport of kings
which the people could play as well.</i>

6
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,519
<i>But which glorious battle is this?</i>

7
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,236
<i>No matter. Aren't all battles
alike in being warlike?</i>

8
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,079
<i>Battlefields are places of posterity,</i>

9
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,396
<i>providing history for pupils.</i>

10
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,995
<i>"Auvergne, the enemy's coming. "
"My kingdom for a horse. "</i>

11
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,633
<i>"Kiss me, Hardy. "</i>

12
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,068
<i>"Shoot, gentlemen. "</i>

13
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,396
Death but no surrender.

14
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:33,672
<i>Louis XV speaking borrowed words.</i>

15
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:37,316
<i>Louis XV the Beloved,
with his many favourites.</i>

16
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:40,239
<i>He may sometimes lose his hat,</i>

17
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:43,591
<i>but never his head.</i>

18
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,349
<i>With roses on their guns
and smiles on their lips,</i>

19
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,197
<i>the regiments of Picardy, Aquitaine
and Burgundy fought elegantly,</i>

20
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:55,151
<i>killing with grace</i>

21
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,032
<i>and disembowelling with style.</i>

22
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,992
<i>Choreographed like a ballet,</i>

23
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,118
<i>this was the Lace War.</i>

24
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,238
<i>His Majesty's soldiers
found this war so amusing</i>

25
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,510
<i>that they made it last seven years.</i>

26
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,752
<i>When the dead
outnumbered the living,</i>

27
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,474
<i>reinforcement was advisable.</i>

28
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,038
<i>Recruiting sergeants
took to the roads of France</i>

29
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:26,630
<i>to scout the remotest villages
for prospects.</i>

30
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,790
Live without worries,
die without regrets.

31
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,073
No need to think,
the King will do it for you.

32
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,635
Don't hesitate,

33
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,196
enlist and win yourself preference.

34
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,358
Come closer... closer... closer!

35
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,709
Enlist in the glorious regiment
of Aquitaine.

36
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,876
Guillot! Guillot!

37
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,558
What do you want with Guillot?

38
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,513
You daughter's being tumbled.

39
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:01,070
- My daughter?
- No need to ask by whom.

40
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,068
That wretch. If I catch him,
I'll bleed him like a chicken,

41
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,316
gut him like a pig.
God'll forgive me.

42
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:08,635
Let's go.

43
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,552
Ignorant louts!

44
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,078
I talk about war and they run away.

45
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,475
Here it is.

46
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:29,036
Where? I don't see anything.

47
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,198
Behind one of the haystacks,
but I don't know which.

48
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,829
Let's get on with it.
Come on.

49
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,159
I've got them both.

50
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:55,477
Proud of yourself?

51
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,631
- Stay down.
- A man!

52
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,592
At your age, Marion.
Aren't you ashamed?

53
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,758
She's the perfect age, you halfwit.

54
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,075
Oh, God, my father.

55
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,317
There you are, little rascal,
bandit, scoundrel.

56
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,794
You, come here.

57
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:15,591
Will you cover yourself and
stop flaunting what God gave you?

58
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:19,236
You little slut!
I thought you were at confession.

59
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:22,029
She couldn't confess before sinning.

60
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,198
Your Parisian airs
won't get you out of this.

61
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,350
What have I done wrong?
Marion is beautiful and desirable.

62
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,788
She didn't know it.

63
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,879
I showed her she could please.
Right, Marion?

64
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,548
- You're just a fine talker.
- Arrogant.

65
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,230
- A foreigner.
- He's not one of us.

66
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,908
Why did you come here?
Where were you?

67
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,078
In Paris loafing
all day in cabarets?

68
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,398
Your uncle should have had
an accident the day he took you in.

69
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,718
All you do is rattle your sword
and rape girls!

70
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:57,076
- Let me at him.
- Calm down, Guillot.

71
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,590
I'll be respectfully obliged
to tickle your ribs.

72
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:02,518
I'll squash you.

73
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,199
Careful, squashing me may not
be so easy. Keep your distance.

74
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,709
Show some respect
to your future father-in-law.

75
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,070
Future farther-in-law?
Are you joking?

76
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,156
You reap what you sow.

77
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,589
You marry Marion,
or I'm a jackass.

78
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,075
Unfortunately, I won't marry her.

79
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,599
She will be your wife.

80
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,678
Don't worry, Marion.
I won't marry you.

81
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,791
I swear on your father's horns.

82
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,679
Son of a...

83
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:41,390
Gentlemen, I bid you farewell.

84
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,317
- Why have you been arrested?
- To end my adventures.

85
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,557
- What crime did you commit?
- Premeditated love.

86
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,115
That's no crime.

87
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,436
It is when you're a recidivist.

88
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,073
Where are they taking you?

89
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,952
To be tortured. To marry me.

90
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,069
- A good-looking boy like yourself?
- To carry on the line.

91
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,478
- Faster.
- I was happy. I was free.

92
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:49,478
Now my life is over
with what's in store.

93
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:52,717
What's in store? Let me tell you.
Give me your hand.

94
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,992
I've decided he'll be my son-in-law
and he'll obey me.

95
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:01,113
You will not marry tomorrow.
I see wonderful adventures,

96
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,158
signs of fortune and fame,

97
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,431
a resplendent uniform,
a fiery horse,

98
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,959
a wild audacity.

99
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,197
You'll be a glorious soldier.

100
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,870
His Majesty
will name him field marshal.

101
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,638
I'll kick him in the rear.

102
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,878
Here's the love line.

103
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:26,638
Forgive my familiarity
and impertinence, My Lord.

104
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,319
What are you saying?

105
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,916
The King's daughter loves you.

106
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:33,758
The King's daughter loves me?

107
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,952
She does and you'll marry her.

108
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,279
The King's daughter?

109
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:43,158
But... how will I know her?

110
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,276
Intimately.

111
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,678
I didn't know I was king.
Because tomorrow you'll marry Marion.

112
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,758
The King's daughter, why not?

113
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,634
She looks charming.

114
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,150
- Come on, let's go.
- You... Some day...

115
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,554
I'll have you beaten by my lackeys.

116
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,509
No need to think,
the King'll do it for you.

117
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,679
Don't hesitate,
enlist and you'll be considered...

118
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,836
Consider me enlisted.

119
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,190
- Just a minute.
- It'll be too late.

120
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,474
Your bounty.

121
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,558
Now glory, the King
and the Princess.

122
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,239
To the King!

123
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,873
To the King!

124
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,353
Have your friends
come to enlist too?

125
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,393
No, they're after a deserter.

126
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,950
Get ready for a beating, scoundrel.

127
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,149
Get back.

128
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,634
Let me pull his ears.

129
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:05,799
Threats. How dare you insult
a soldier of the King.

130
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,788
I insult no one. But this
good-for-nothing belongs to me.

131
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,355
He signed
in the regiment of Aquitaine.

132
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,755
His signature's worth nothing.

133
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,713
He's committed to marry
my daughter.

134
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:22,594
Let her wait a while.
He'll be back in seven years.

135
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,633
Listen, Fanfan,
if Marion doesn't marry,

136
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,512
I'll break you.

137
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:32,716
Marion is charming enough to marry
without me. Let's find her a suitor.

138
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,316
Hands up anyone who'll marry her.

139
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:41,271
First come, first served.
Hurry up.

140
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:43,994
No offers on the left? On the right?

141
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,633
This is my last word.

142
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:48,638
I'll offer my bounty as dowry.
Who volunteers?

143
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,519
May the best man win.

144
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,155
You didn't expect to find me here.

145
00:12:18,680 --> 00:12:21,990
- What are you doing here?
- Imbecile. Don't you get it?

146
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,589
I'm Sergeant La Franchise's
daughter.

147
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,150
A damned wench she is too.

148
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:31,636
She got me drunk and said
the King would give me land.

149
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,637
Same with him.

150
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,990
She said I'll be the General's aide.

151
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,512
I believed her, of course.
She's a gypsy.

152
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,871
She didn't lie to me.

153
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:44,676
She told me what I already knew.

154
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,673
I know my future
as if I had lived it.

155
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,597
You believed me?

156
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:55,908
My destiny will be as you foretold
and as I've decided.

157
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:58,953
No doubt.
I shall marry the King's daughter.

158
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,354
Poor fool.

159
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,996
Have you no faith in yourself?

160
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,351
Am I not a soldier as you predicted?

161
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,757
But you didn't predict
I would hate the regiment

162
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:11,439
because of you,

163
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,916
and your father would lose
his recruiting money

164
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,680
because I'm off to join Picardy.

165
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,994
No way, little man.
I don't work for my competitors.

166
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,839
- One move and I'll split you.
- Just try it!

167
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,638
What a sad day.

168
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,435
The sky is low, the weather dreary.

169
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:01,875
Oh, it's only you.

170
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,349
Were you asleep?

171
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,195
- I was dreaming.
- Really.

172
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,597
What a dream.
You were being tortured.

173
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,835
Tortured?

174
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:16,352
You were publicly flogged
like a witch.

175
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,071
You were almost naked,

176
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,590
a bit plump for my taste,

177
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:26,997
with amusing dimples
on certain parts of your anatomy.

178
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,475
Shut up. Don't be so vulgar.

179
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,636
You were squirming like an eel.

180
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,992
You were in tears, asking for mercy.
I was there in the front row,

181
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:38,395
with Her Majesty, my wife.

182
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,592
I could have given you mercy,
but I didn't.

183
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,712
Let me go back to sleep
to see the end of my dream.

184
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:49,877
No, get up!
No dreaming around here.

185
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,953
My pleasure.

186
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:54,796
Looks like I'm still tied up.

187
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,589
So free am I
that I don't feel my bonds.

188
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,876
- Thank you, Adeline.
- What?

189
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:07,153
I'm not fooled by your tact.
Thank you, Adeline.

190
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,432
Did you not fear, in loyal deceit,

191
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,313
to leave beside me,
as though by chance,

192
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,158
all accessories for my escape.

193
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:17,874
This sword, knife, pistol.

194
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,228
Thank you, Adeline.

195
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,751
You wished me to believe my escape
to be my own effort.

196
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,395
I have seized the opportunity.
Thank you.

197
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:31,593
Freely I shall remain your prisoner.
Thank you, Adeline.

198
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,438
You see, I trust you.

199
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:36,438
I reveal all my secrets to you.
Thank you, Adeline.

200
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,709
Thank you.

201
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,915
Help! Help!

202
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:13,640
Not that way, there's danger.

203
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,274
Everyone in the bushes.
Come on, let's go.

204
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:20,279
I'll lose my bounty
if you all end up dead.

205
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,917
Hello there, maidens.
Do I have to kick you out?

206
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:31,556
Maidens, if you will,
but to be treated with civility.

207
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,910
Your hand, thank you.

208
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,475
Her Highness, Henriette of France.

209
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,390
Hello, Henriette.
I'll take this and this. Let's move.

210
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:45,512
- You're Madame de Pompadour.
- So I am.

211
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:48,350
You're a despicable coward.

212
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:51,279
Be quiet or
they'll hear us, imbecile.

213
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,674
Imbecile?

214
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:54,755
Here I am!

215
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,393
Go and you'll be a deserter.

216
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,671
Keep away or I'll run you through.

217
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,797
He'll get himself killed.
My bounty.

218
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,276
My bounty! He'll cheat me
out of it, the rogue.

219
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:17,878
Sir, you were wonderful.
Thank you, sir.

220
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,314
Thank you, madam.

221
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,796
You're as bold as you are brave.

222
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,989
And very young.

223
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,955
I've always been young for my age.
That raised a bit of a sweat.

224
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:35,835
For a greenhorn,
that wasn't bad at all, my lad.

225
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:39,839
But you still lack
skill and experience.

226
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,598
He's our scout.

227
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:45,872
If he were in danger,
we would have intervened.

228
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,073
You, you certainly have no fears.
More are coming.

229
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,512
Never fear. I'll handle them.

230
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,676
No, they're our men.

231
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,153
That's too bad.

232
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,192
How handsome they are.
Just look at them.

233
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,753
Well, cowards...

234
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,711
Proud of yourselves?

235
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:05,308
Come, take your places.

236
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,078
I'll deal with you tonight.

237
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,873
We're well protected.

238
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,958
They were brave to return.

239
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,629
- Here, this is yours.
- You keep it, a prize of war.

240
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,558
I beg you, don't mar my pleasure.

241
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:22,797
I've already been greatly rewarded.

242
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,911
Here!

243
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:28,112
For allowing me to earn
the two sweetest kisses ever.

244
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,198
I'm as happy as if
the King's daughter had kissed me.

245
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,231
- Yet...
- And yet...

246
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:35,191
- What's your name?
- Fanfan.

247
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,275
What else?

248
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:38,991
Soldier of the King.

249
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:41,509
I'll be a soldier of the King.

250
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,392
Very well, Fanfan.

251
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:46,275
Take this tulip as a souvenir of me.

252
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,356
May it bring you good luck.

253
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:49,833
But madam...

254
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,554
Goodbye, Fanfan La Tulipe.

255
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:55,078
Goodbye, fairy godmother.

256
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,358
They nabbed Her Highness.
The coach is gone.

257
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,675
Sergeant, have you seen a coach?

258
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,950
- A coach?
- Her Highness's coach.

259
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,630
- Driven by four horses?
- Yes, seen it?

260
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,991
- Her Highness in person?
- With Mme de Pompadour.

261
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,513
Madame de Pompadour
and the King's daughter.

262
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,397
- We saw it. It went that way.
- The bandits?

263
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:38,592
You'll find the bandits
a bit further on.

264
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,870
I've cooled them off.

265
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,071
- What did you say?
- The truth.

266
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,716
We cut them down,
and Her Highness went on her way.

267
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,593
- Take this for the trouble.
- Thank you.

268
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,513
The King's daughter.
The King's daughter kissed me.

269
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,115
Is that so strange?
Isn't she your wife-to-be?

270
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,753
AQUITAINE REGIMENT

271
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,039
<i>We now witness
the moving ceremony of induction.</i>

272
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,312
<i>The new recruits discover</i>

273
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,113
<i>the army to be one big family.</i>

274
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,835
Line up!

275
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:33,951
Come closer.
Who recruited such nitwits?

276
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,116
Just look at these cretins.

277
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:01,594
Come on.

278
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:07,915
I hope your recruits are bright

279
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:11,430
and bursting with life...
and ready to die if need be.

280
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,709
Just look.

281
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,310
- The size seems right.
- Five feet and one inch.

282
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,919
The eye is bright,

283
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:22,113
the hair well-rooted,

284
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,679
the teeth sound.

285
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,870
You, smile. Thank you.

286
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,352
A four-leaf clover.

287
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,835
Luck is at your feet, my friend.

288
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,995
- Your name.
- Fanfan La Tulipe.

289
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:42,430
La Tulipe?
Now, there's a fine nickname.

290
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,791
We have a Larkspur,
a Meadowsweet, a Buttercup.

291
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,832
This isn't a regiment,
it's a flower-bed.

292
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:51,275
What's this?

293
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:54,153
From Madame de Pompadour.

294
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,669
For saving
the King's daughter's life.

295
00:23:56,800 --> 00:24:01,635
- You saved Her Highness?
- Yes, from bandits.

296
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,550
Compliments. Her Highness
allowed you to kiss her?

297
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:08,240
Naturally, I'm to marry her.

298
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,476
Adeline's prediction.

299
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,435
Funny. Very funny.

300
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:17,313
Credulity is the main
strength of an army.

301
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,588
Mirth, Fier a Bras, not irony.

302
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,518
It's the prerogative of superiors.

303
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,958
Do I amuse you?
I can easily kill another rogue.

304
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,557
We're among soldiers here,
not rogues.

305
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,073
Welcome, my lads.

306
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,592
I'm your captain.

307
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:46,077
In short, I'll love to command
and you'll be pleased to obey.

308
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:51,595
You're now soldiers of the King.
Be worthy of the honour.

309
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,192
Swords disengaged.
Swords high!

310
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,518
Swords in place.

311
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,670
Pistols in hand. Pistols ready.

312
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,798
Ready. Fire.

313
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:07,310
Flex. Extend. Down.

314
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,837
Flex. Extend. Extend...

315
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,510
Extend. Down.

316
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:20,112
Flex. Extend. Down.

317
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,352
Swords disengaged.

318
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,312
Swords high.

319
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,472
Swords in place.

320
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:39,275
On your knees. Down.

321
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:40,999
Up!

322
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,033
On your knees. Down. Up!

323
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:10,314
Where do you think you're going,
trooper?

324
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,437
Silly and odious.
That's how I find this exercise.

325
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,630
- Who are you talking to?
- You, sergeant-major.

326
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,592
I'll tame you. Don't forget
I've killed three horses.

327
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,790
Alas, the best always go first.

328
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:29,912
Insubordination, desertion.

329
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,831
Tranche-Montagne, take this man
to the cell immediately.

330
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,678
You'll know my name, cretin!

331
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,836
What a nice name.
Shall we go?

332
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,029
Let's.

333
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:43,792
I'll deal with you later.
You, get up.

334
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:47,354
On your knees. Down. Up.

335
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:02,156
Don't hold it against me.
I'm taking you to prison.

336
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,714
A chance to take a stroll.

337
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,671
The pleasure's all mine.

338
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,234
- I should have pulled his ears.
- Yeah!

339
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:10,509
Be quiet.

340
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,952
You'd be a dead man.
He's a real cutthroat with his sword.

341
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:18,629
- Last year he killed three recruits.
- Damaging the goods.

342
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,550
You're hot-blooded. Take care.

343
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,639
I used to be like that,
couldn't contain myself.

344
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:27,990
Now I have eight kids.

345
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:30,998
The anger gone,
I had another mouth to feed.

346
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,269
Here we are.

347
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,637
I'll tell my wife
to bring you a jug of wine.

348
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,910
You'll sleep just as well here.

349
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:47,317
With the captain, show remorse.

350
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,954
Remorse? Never.

351
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,116
I'm the King's daughter's fiancé.

352
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:53,832
There he goes again.

353
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:57,748
Get some rest, may it wise you up.

354
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,677
Come on kids, let's go.

355
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,395
Well, are you proud of yourself?

356
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,228
That madman could put you
in the galleys for ten years.

357
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,955
I'm better off ten years in the galleys
than seven in the army.

358
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,798
Come here!

359
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,069
Listen to me.

360
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,596
Did they trap you into this?

361
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:24,597
No, I'm wary of Fier a Bras.

362
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,199
Why?

363
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,197
Has he authority over you?

364
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,629
No, but he's courting me.

365
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,272
And you humour him?

366
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,278
I don't want such an enemy.

367
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,949
You fear him? Yet you and men...

368
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:43,310
You want your ears boxed?

369
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:48,560
I was raised in a camp,
but I insist on respect, remember that.

370
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:50,079
Even from you.

371
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:53,670
- I'll always respect you.
- Don't be vulgar.

372
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,633
With your trade...

373
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,795
What trade?

374
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,036
Fake gypsy.

375
00:29:01,160 --> 00:29:03,833
The destiny you foretold
will be mine, anyway.

376
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:07,509
Which of us lied? Which one cheated?
Which one seduced?

377
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:10,200
Your troubles aren't my fault.

378
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:13,790
Even if we hadn't met on the road,
you would've enlisted.

379
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:17,879
You didn't want to marry.
So you took advantage of us.

380
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,948
Now look at me.

381
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:24,153
I'll speak to Fier a Bras.
He does what I ask.

382
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:27,829
I don't need your help.

383
00:29:28,800 --> 00:29:30,870
I'll deal with him myself.

384
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,915
I'll get out without his permission.

385
00:29:34,520 --> 00:29:36,636
I'll cut off his ears.

386
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,159
Don't do that.

387
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,753
Are you afraid to lose him?

388
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,950
There's nothing between us.

389
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,272
Why so hostile?

390
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:49,439
Did I tell on you in the wagon
when you broke loose?

391
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:52,028
I slapped you and I'd do it again.

392
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,550
But I was kind afterwards.

393
00:29:55,680 --> 00:30:00,595
I gave you food and wine.
I stole tobacco from my father for you.

394
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:04,395
So, you're guarding the prisoner.
Good for you.

395
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:06,272
You must keep an eye on the rogue.

396
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:11,554
I'll make sure he's branded
and slaving in the galleys.

397
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,070
I'd be careful if I were you.

398
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,316
- Why?
- I'd forgive him.

399
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,637
- What for?
- He's a terror, a true desperado.

400
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:23,911
It'll be his life or yours.
He'll want to avenge himself.

401
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,155
Avenge himself?

402
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,795
Hell's bells and buckets of blood!

403
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,878
Do you hear me, mongrel?
You, louse.

404
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,516
But... He's gone!

405
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,595
Gone?

406
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:45,512
The door's locked.
Where did he go?

407
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,678
He can't be far.

408
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,280
Guard! Guard!

409
00:30:57,400 --> 00:30:59,960
Sound the alert.
Trumpets! Trumpets!

410
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:02,071
Guard! Captain.

411
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:08,869
Guard! Trumpets!

412
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:15,399
Close all doors.

413
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:18,990
Check all exits!
The prisoner has escaped!

414
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,109
You should come down.

415
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,758
Nice view.

416
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,473
Now there's a pretty valley
between two peaks.

417
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,235
Do you hear me?

418
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,071
Is the fishing good there?

419
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,360
You're really too stupid.

420
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,351
How nice of you!

421
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:59,392
Bringing me wine!
Give me your sword.

422
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:00,873
My sword?

423
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:04,711
What for?

424
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:07,718
A soldier without a sword
is a rose without thorns.

425
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,310
What is he doing?
Is that what all the fuss is about?

426
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:16,468
Captain, I locked him up,
then presto he was gone.

427
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,919
But where?

428
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,032
What's worse, I had locked the door.

429
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,320
But there, he's gone.

430
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,359
Have you lost something?

431
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,119
What are you doing there?

432
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:36,075
Me? I was waiting for you.
Do come up.

433
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,191
Come up so I can tickle your spleen.

434
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:44,757
"So I can tickle your spleen"?
How well put.

435
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:48,111
So I can tickle your spleen!
A ladder!

436
00:32:49,000 --> 00:32:50,752
You asked for it.

437
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:55,792
I'm anxious to see him in action,
I've heard so much.

438
00:32:55,920 --> 00:32:56,875
Aren't you?

439
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,912
Stop them
or they'll kill each other.

440
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,196
At that age, death comes easy.

441
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,713
What's going on?
What a hullabaloo.

442
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,593
- I was doing the wash.
- Be quiet, look.

443
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:16,318
- You couldn't fight like that.
- Listen, I lent him my sword.

444
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:19,514
Keep off those powder-kegs.

445
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:21,631
I hope he kills Fier a Bras.

446
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:23,751
What a thing to say!

447
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,908
Be quiet. They're beginning.

448
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:17,235
Cuckoo!

449
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,233
Are you all right?

450
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:19,552
Be careful. Fire!

451
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,908
It's going to blow up.

452
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,393
Put out the fire.

453
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,758
Where's Fanfan?

454
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,359
He's here.

455
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,278
I'll never forget
what you did for me.

456
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:50,039
We're one big family now.

457
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:52,469
You'll be my brother and I,
your father.

458
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,034
Meanwhile, catch, Papa.

459
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,472
Come, son.

460
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,393
Have you seen my pipe?

461
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,555
No.

462
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,196
Where is Captain de la Houlette?

463
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:14,515
What about him?

464
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,950
I'm here. Where else would I be?

465
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,479
What a stupid question.

466
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,315
How can I help?

467
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,317
Letter from Marshal d'Estrées.

468
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,590
What good news do you bring?

469
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:31,550
This smells of powder.
We'll break camp tonight.

470
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:35,070
We'll take up position
near Vertelune.

471
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:40,718
It seems the hostilities
are at last about to resume.

472
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,636
My swashbucklers,

473
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,239
bless your good fortune.

474
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:48,636
You came close
to spending the night in the cell.

475
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,036
War has spared you the humiliation.

476
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,037
Long live war!

477
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:56,196
Sound the assembly.

478
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:58,754
No, not this way.

479
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,072
<i>As the regiment of Aquitaine
struck camp,</i>

480
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,989
<i>at Vertelune
the King held a Council of War,</i>

481
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:11,036
<i>with Marshal d'Estrées,</i>

482
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,870
<i>and some other great commanders
of the day.</i>

483
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:18,595
<i>There were also some ladies,
Madame de Pompadour.</i>

484
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,638
<i>Her Highness Princess Henriette.</i>

485
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,159
<i>What's that impertinent bugler
interrupting us for?</i>

486
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,869
<i>It's the regiment of Aquitaine.</i>

487
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,390
<i>It followed us to camp nearby.</i>

488
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:41,111
<i>Fortunes of war,
fortunes of love.</i>

489
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:48,919
<i>Fanfan, do not accuse us
of complicity with destiny.</i>

490
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,589
<i>We had no wish to tempt you,
but look...</i>

491
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,189
<i>This is her window and behind it...</i>

492
00:37:57,680 --> 00:37:59,193
The King's daughter.

493
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,470
Forget her. Let's get a drink.

494
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:03,830
- Everywhere I go...
- What?

495
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,559
If I listened...

496
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,911
Don't, you'll end up believing.

497
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,234
Providence...

498
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:14,352
We'll talk at the ale-house.

499
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,835
A drink is a great consoler.

500
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:19,315
Adeline told the truth
unintentionally.

501
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:22,637
A woman tells the truth
to hide a lie.

502
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:26,673
Stop staring at that window.
It's drinking time.

503
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,918
The village is full of Henriettes
just raring to dance.

504
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:32,439
Come on.

505
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,237
One, two, three, four, five...
Friendly.

506
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:44,635
One, two, three, four, five...
Valiant.

507
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:46,910
Attractive

508
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:48,839
and a feared swashbuckler.

509
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,190
- Friendly and valiant?
- Yes.

510
00:38:51,320 --> 00:38:53,629
Pick another card.

511
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,558
And another one. Clubs.

512
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,079
A warm heart.

513
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,236
Indomitable courage.

514
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,272
You'll win
what he has refused others.

515
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:07,632
You'll share a great fortune
as a married couple.

516
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,116
Married? And he's attractive?

517
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:16,750
A great lover,
expert in the art of caresses.

518
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:19,189
Elegant, a pleasing manner,

519
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,392
the most adorable
and fetching moustache.

520
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,432
- Moustache? Are you sure?
- Positive.

521
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,393
That's not quite how I imagined him.

522
00:39:28,520 --> 00:39:29,999
He'll shave,

523
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:32,350
or maybe it hasn't grown yet.

524
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:36,799
Either way,
love is in these three cards.

525
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,353
I'm so happy, father.

526
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,233
You can't know how happy I am.

527
00:39:41,360 --> 00:39:44,636
Poor Fier a Bras.

528
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,113
Did you hear?

529
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,791
Even if I wanted to,
fate would not make me your wife.

530
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,476
Your daughter is no physiognomist.

531
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,034
<i>- Five pistoles.
- Here.</i>

532
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,912
So, did I do it right?

533
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:02,589
Yes, but why didn't
she recognize my description?

534
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:05,234
She dreams of another, but who?

535
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,797
Warm heart,
indomitable courage, a great lover.

536
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:13,633
My description exactly.

537
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,677
To your love life, Fanfan.

538
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:20,119
To Princess Henriette.

539
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:23,278
Again?
You're daydreaming, Fanfan.

540
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,836
Drink up and shut up.

541
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,030
Why are you staring at me?

542
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,478
Are you really going
to grow a moustache?

543
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,233
- I've thought about it, why?
- He has!

544
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:39,318
Tranche-Montagne, I love you.
She was right.

545
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,159
- Who?
- I consulted a fortune-teller.

546
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,475
You consulted a rival?

547
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,158
She's a real one.

548
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:50,077
- And you believed her?
- I believe in cards, horoscopes,

549
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:54,398
stars, palmistry, God,
the Blessed Virgin, and in love.

550
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:58,395
- I do too.
- She said a gallant will love me.

551
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:00,317
Great adventures await me.

552
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,273
Win what he refuses others.

553
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,833
A military career.

554
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,758
As a married couple
we'd have much fortune.

555
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:09,108
I'll find glory.

556
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,390
My secret desires.

557
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,953
The Princess' love.

558
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:16,912
You believed her?

559
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:19,638
She was joking.

560
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,510
Princess Henriette is mine,
such is my destiny.

561
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,639
Well then, go to her.

562
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:28,678
Go to her!

563
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:32,108
Why do you hesitate?

564
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:35,232
What do you fear?
Your lucky star will protect you.

565
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:40,511
Is your warm heart afraid
and indomitable courage fading?

566
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,232
Are you challenging me?

567
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,031
Tonight I'll have her hand.

568
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,389
Tonight. Henriette. Her hand.

569
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,913
God, have mercy on him.

570
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,595
Who's there?

571
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,149
Guards!

572
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,553
Through the window!

573
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:17,390
Surround the castle and take them,
dead or alive.

574
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,988
- Good Lord!
- It's beautiful.

575
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,430
How do I address
the King's daughter?

576
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,516
First you do...

577
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:02,076
- Then...
- Like this?

578
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,320
With 45,000 men,
superiority is vital.

579
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:07,908
Our army is smaller
than the enemy's.

580
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,717
The smaller the force,
the easier it is to deploy unnoticed.

581
00:44:12,840 --> 00:44:17,470
If Your Majesty concurs,
I've decided on the battle here.

582
00:44:18,120 --> 00:44:19,473
Here, marshal?

583
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,397
Here, Your Majesty.

584
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:24,034
What has the enemy decided?

585
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,230
The enemy has consented.

586
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:29,389
Where will your right flank be?

587
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:30,949
On the left.

588
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:34,232
On the left. A charming notion.

589
00:44:34,360 --> 00:44:36,510
And the left flank on the right.

590
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,518
No, Sire, at the centre.

591
00:44:39,640 --> 00:44:42,154
- And the centre on the right.
- As it should be.

592
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:44,956
An astute disposition.

593
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:48,311
Disorientation of the enemy.

594
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:52,949
We're expecting
an estimated 10,000 deaths.

595
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:56,637
The cost would be higher
with Marshal de Saxe.

596
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:01,593
Am I in the habit of haggling
for victory, marshal?

597
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:08,716
Two men, probably spies,
have just entered the castle.

598
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,675
Find them. Capture them.
Hang them

599
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,393
and leave me be.

600
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:57,479
What are you doing?
Where have you come from?

601
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,430
You won't believe me.
I fell down the chimney.

602
00:46:04,360 --> 00:46:05,588
Take him away.

603
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,558
Look!

604
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,035
Your Highness, a man is in here.

605
00:48:18,440 --> 00:48:20,590
Don't touch me.

606
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,278
Do you recognize me?

607
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:25,631
The highway, the brigands,
the tulip?

608
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:27,275
Fanfan?

609
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,994
She recognized me. I knew it!

610
00:48:32,120 --> 00:48:34,395
Our love is pre-ordained.

611
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:39,071
Quick, Henriette,
love me, as fate wills it.

612
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:08,477
No moustache, see?
Do you like me better?

613
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:09,953
- Why?
- What do you mean?

614
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,029
At the request
of His Majesty Louis XV,

615
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,118
the court martial of the army
in the field

616
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:26,473
has sentenced to death Fanfan
La Tulipe and Tranche-Montagne

617
00:49:27,360 --> 00:49:31,717
<i>for desertion, treason,
lese-majesté,</i>

618
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:33,273
trespassing

619
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,436
and disturbing the peace.

620
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,155
Consequently,
they will be hanged

621
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:43,114
tomorrow morning
before their regiment.

622
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,993
The ceremony
will be followed by a ball,

623
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:48,839
which will end with fireworks.

624
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:53,318
The first dance is mine.

625
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,796
What's wrong with her?
Bad news?

626
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,715
She was fond of Tranche-Montagne.

627
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:04,956
Poor Tranche-Montagne.

628
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:07,640
Cheer up, we'll miss him.

629
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,833
Besides, hanging
isn't such a bad death.

630
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:16,397
But he was different
from other men, he hated death.

631
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:18,632
The King's not being fair.

632
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:20,159
Sergeant-major.

633
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,033
- What?
- Will Papa be hung tomorrow?

634
00:50:24,640 --> 00:50:27,279
Forgive us, Your Majesty,

635
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,789
but there's a pressing matter

636
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:32,673
of concern to this young beauty.

637
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:37,592
An affair of state, I warrant.

638
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,757
No, an affair of the heart.

639
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:45,158
That is much more serious.
What do you want of me?

640
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:48,317
- A tiny favour.
- That bodes ill.

641
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,793
A favour.

642
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:53,356
The favour of pardon...
for Fanfan La Tulipe.

643
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:54,993
Such earnestness.

644
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:59,193
He once risked his life
to rescue Henriette and me.

645
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:01,914
Now it's our turn to save him.

646
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:05,157
Save him, Sire. Promise me.

647
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:09,158
Arise, my child. Arise.

648
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,034
Do not waste your tears
on a wretch who doesn't love you.

649
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:19,075
He is obsessed with the idea
of becoming my son-in-law.

650
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:21,998
My son-in-law!

651
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:26,755
It's my fault.
I made him act that way.

652
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,757
With a false prediction.

653
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,474
I dared him to win
Madame Henriette.

654
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,792
How old are you, my child?

655
00:51:35,920 --> 00:51:37,114
Twenty-two.

656
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:39,800
No predictions for you?

657
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,514
I shall marry Fanfan La Tulipe.

658
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,428
Marvellous. Why those tears then?

659
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:49,518
Let fate and justice
take their course.

660
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:51,949
I've decided he'll be hung.

661
00:51:52,080 --> 00:51:55,152
But moved by your beauty,

662
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,430
I shall grant you the favour...

663
00:51:58,640 --> 00:51:59,993
of bidding him farewell.

664
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:05,314
I don't want to say goodbye.
I love you.

665
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:08,830
I'll always love you. Always.

666
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,714
You must say goodbye nicely.
Promise you'll forget me.

667
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:16,355
I'll never forget you.
I'll always love you.

668
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:20,109
But, Adeline, what have I done
to deserve your love?

669
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,390
Nothing. Why do you love me?

670
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:24,192
What do I know?

671
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:29,755
I feel happy when I'm near you,
when you look at me.

672
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:36,431
Don't cry.
I wasn't condemned to see you cry.

673
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,836
Smile. Come on, smile.

674
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:44,395
It's all my fault.
I shouldn't have misled you.

675
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,839
Why did you listen to me?

676
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:48,950
I believed in you.

677
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,433
And now,

678
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:54,473
if I had to love someone else,
it would be you.

679
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,354
Don't leave me. I couldn't go
on living without you.

680
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:02,758
You were told you would live happily.
Forget me.

681
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:08,079
Fanfan will have had the short
life of a rose, of a tulip.

682
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:10,830
May it bring you happiness.

683
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:13,030
My poor Tranche-Montagne.

684
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:14,559
I'm so sad.

685
00:53:14,680 --> 00:53:17,717
How happy do you think I am?

686
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,719
Life is hard,
especially when you have to leave it.

687
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:26,671
Time's up.
Have you nothing more to say?

688
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,231
- I love you!
- Come along.

689
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,078
I love you.

690
00:53:34,440 --> 00:53:36,874
Don't be sad. I don't love you.

691
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:43,068
You could at least have said
you loved her.

692
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,919
I wanted to leave a bad impression.

693
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,916
I don't want her to miss me.

694
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:53,513
Maybe...

695
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,910
I was beginning to love her.

696
00:53:56,040 --> 00:53:58,554
It's about time.

697
00:53:58,680 --> 00:54:00,671
I acted like...

698
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:02,153
A brute.

699
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:05,276
I wanted to fulfil my destiny.

700
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:07,516
Couldn't you look around you?

701
00:54:08,560 --> 00:54:12,792
Adeline is worth more
than any king's daughter.

702
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,876
I believed in my destiny.

703
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:17,472
I still believe in it.

704
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,313
Not for long.

705
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:23,157
Present arms!

706
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:25,593
Attention!

707
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:28,991
Disengage sword!

708
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:31,159
High sword.

709
00:54:33,680 --> 00:54:35,671
Show sword.

710
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:57,391
I'm glad to see an execution
before I die.

711
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,671
My poor wife always said
she'd die first.

712
00:55:00,800 --> 00:55:02,233
Who can you trust?

713
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:06,515
They're walking, they're alive
and an instant later,

714
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,269
they're gone.

715
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:12,279
To them, we'll be dead.
Life hangs...

716
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,634
but by a thread.

717
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,837
Let's wait for each other up there.

718
00:55:35,960 --> 00:55:37,188
See you soon.

719
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:45,354
Is that where they'll hang Papa?

720
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:46,754
Just wait and see.

721
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:48,313
Mom, I have to pee.

722
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,714
Afterwards.

723
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:57,950
Goodbye, Tranche-Montagne.
Chin up!

724
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,395
I'd like to see you in my shoes.

725
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,314
Is it all over?

726
00:56:23,440 --> 00:56:25,396
I didn't feel a thing, did you?

727
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:27,399
There you are.

728
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:30,193
If that's death, why all the fuss?

729
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:33,628
Yes, but we're alive

730
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:36,558
and we're going to go on living.

731
00:56:36,680 --> 00:56:38,033
Wait till I tell my wife.

732
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,673
By order of the King,

733
00:56:50,800 --> 00:56:54,475
since the sentence
failed to be executed,

734
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:56,795
the prisoners are pardoned.

735
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:00,595
May the will of God be done
for His Majesty's pleasure.

736
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:02,676
Long live the King!

737
00:57:09,640 --> 00:57:11,153
Long live the King!

738
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:14,192
Had I known,
I wouldn't have gotten so upset.

739
00:57:14,320 --> 00:57:16,276
Adeline!

740
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:18,875
It's a miracle.

741
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:22,994
It is indeed a miracle
the King decided to pardon.

742
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:27,352
That the King should lend himself
to this charade is another.

743
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,199
Never was a miracle better managed.

744
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,632
His Majesty awaits your gratitude.

745
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:42,472
Come.

746
00:57:42,840 --> 00:57:45,400
Come and do something
with that hair.

747
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:48,114
Get that hair out of your eyes.

748
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,993
There. Much better.

749
00:57:51,800 --> 00:57:54,473
An air of modesty is exciting.

750
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,909
Don't tremble.
What do you fear?

751
00:57:57,040 --> 00:57:59,713
I'm not afraid, not trembling.

752
00:57:59,840 --> 00:58:02,308
The King proved to be
an ordinary man.

753
00:58:02,440 --> 00:58:04,590
A sensitive man, easy to talk to.

754
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,392
He shall listen to you.

755
00:58:06,520 --> 00:58:09,751
Make the most of his goodwill
as he will of yours.

756
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:14,237
Above all, don't forget he's...
your master.

757
00:58:14,360 --> 00:58:17,636
Let yourself be guided by his whims.

758
00:58:18,920 --> 00:58:21,070
There. You're set.

759
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:26,599
You're right,
he's a man like other men.

760
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:39,431
What a graceful curtsey!

761
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:43,192
I see Lebel schools
his recruits well.

762
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,999
Do it again.

763
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:47,394
Very good.

764
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:51,638
Spare me your thanks.
It is enough to see you happy.

765
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:56,436
Your face speaks for you,
and I have not eyes enough to listen.

766
00:58:56,560 --> 00:58:59,757
Do you love your King, my child?

767
00:58:59,880 --> 00:59:01,916
As much as I respect him, Sire.

768
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,952
As a royal subject,

769
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:08,629
you would not wish to displease him?

770
00:59:09,320 --> 00:59:11,754
I should not dream of it, Sire.

771
00:59:12,760 --> 00:59:17,550
So you will be loyally happy
to please him?

772
00:59:17,680 --> 00:59:20,752
Come here, pure beauty,

773
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:25,313
natural grace, charming object.

774
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,319
Come here.

775
00:59:27,880 --> 00:59:30,792
Look at me and let's forget
who we really are.

776
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:34,799
You wish to please me
and pleasure is all I ask.

777
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,273
Have a seat,

778
00:59:37,080 --> 00:59:39,878
give me your pretty little hand.

779
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,956
But my heart belongs to Fanfan.

780
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,439
Who asked for your heart?

781
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:49,711
All I ask for is a trifling matter.

782
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:51,789
I'm a good girl.

783
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,033
You owe me for my affection.

784
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:01,397
If you love Fanfan, thank me.

785
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:06,354
My whims enable you
to offer proof of your love,

786
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:10,917
by betraying in his service
the loyalty you have sworn him.

787
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:16,239
The few moments of pleasure
we'll share will buy him his pardon.

788
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:21,678
After which,
if your conduct has satisfied me,

789
01:00:21,800 --> 01:00:26,157
I shall reward you,
and he will owe you his fortune.

790
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:30,751
But so many other girls
want to take advantage of their beauty.

791
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:34,156
I find your resistance
more stimulating.

792
01:00:34,280 --> 01:00:36,748
I order you to love me unreservedly.

793
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:39,838
No, please, don't touch me.

794
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:01,350
What are you waiting for?
Run after her.

795
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:30,876
What happened with the King?

796
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,150
Nothing. The King wanted...

797
01:01:33,280 --> 01:01:36,397
- And you didn't. So?
- I slapped him.

798
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:38,556
- You didn't!
- I did.

799
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,514
- But if Monsieur Lebel finds me...
- He won't.

800
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:44,232
You slapped the King?

801
01:01:45,240 --> 01:01:46,593
I dream of it.

802
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:50,276
My compliments, Lebel.

803
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:55,028
I ran and ran, but she's gone.
Vanished.

804
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,755
Spare me your explanations.

805
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:00,348
I want that girl, do you hear?

806
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,838
Find out where she is,

807
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,394
but do it discreetly.

808
01:02:08,520 --> 01:02:11,956
Kidnap her
and bring her to me, discreetly.

809
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:15,035
You have 48 hours.

810
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:18,393
If I can't even rely
on your knavery...

811
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:38,429
My friend, all I can say is
long live life!

812
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,391
And I'm being modest.

813
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:44,877
I've seen death from up close
and she's not worth knowing.

814
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,434
She's got a real death's-head!

815
01:02:47,560 --> 01:02:49,312
Cheers, my widow!

816
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,079
Don't drink so much.
You're out of control.

817
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:56,751
If you don't like it,
you can always weep on my grave.

818
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,913
Here's to you, Fanfan.

819
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,080
Don't you see Adeline in my glass?

820
01:03:09,080 --> 01:03:11,913
Adeline, she's smiling at me.

821
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,911
She's telling me to drink her.

822
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,472
I didn't expect to find you there.

823
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:22,431
Come on out now.

824
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:28,352
She's disappeared.

825
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:30,189
Adeline!

826
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,433
We've been looking for you all day!

827
01:03:37,120 --> 01:03:40,510
Come back to Papa!

828
01:03:42,640 --> 01:03:44,949
- You tell her.
- Come back...

829
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:54,359
- Strange she's disappeared like that.
- Indeed.

830
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,277
Let me tell you something.

831
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:59,233
She's fled the resurrection.

832
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,396
She thinks you're dead.

833
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:05,991
You don't tell a girl
you don't love her before dying.

834
01:04:07,080 --> 01:04:10,390
How can you not mind
not being loved?

835
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:14,078
Monsieur Fanfan La Tulipe?

836
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:16,509
That's us, loosely.

837
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:18,232
It's me, specifically.

838
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:21,750
I've come for my mistress.
Madame de Pompadour.

839
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:24,959
Madame de...

840
01:04:25,080 --> 01:04:26,513
Pompadour?

841
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:32,631
I'm to tell you Adeline is safely
hidden at the convent of Mortelame.

842
01:04:32,760 --> 01:04:35,149
Safely hidden? Why?

843
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,429
Is she in danger?

844
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:39,199
The greatest.
She slapped the King.

845
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:40,878
The King?

846
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:44,235
- Of France?
- Of France.

847
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:46,271
She saw the King?

848
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:51,190
Yes, to thank him for the gift
he gave her of your lives.

849
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,595
How is it possible?

850
01:04:53,720 --> 01:04:56,314
She dared to speak
to the King about us.

851
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:58,476
She slapped the King?

852
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,479
But why did she do that?

853
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:07,190
That's my kind of woman.

854
01:05:08,080 --> 01:05:10,753
The King's disrespectful and...

855
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:13,836
You said she's at Mortelame?

856
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,359
She will be tonight.

857
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,708
Fetch Lebel.

858
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:20,799
My mistress urges you
to be wary of Monsieur Lebel.

859
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:24,356
Monsieur Lebel? The chamberlain?

860
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,517
He swore to find Adeline
and bring her to the King.

861
01:05:27,640 --> 01:05:29,437
He may be after you.

862
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,912
Take care, Fanfan La Tulipe.

863
01:05:33,040 --> 01:05:37,477
If you see her, tell her to cheer up
and that I love her.

864
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:42,230
Tranche-Montagne, I'm loved
by a woman worthy to be queen.

865
01:05:43,120 --> 01:05:44,075
La Franchise!

866
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:45,793
My dear La Franchise.

867
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,230
Hug me. We've found her.

868
01:05:51,040 --> 01:05:54,874
Stop worrying,
Adeline is at the convent of Mortelame.

869
01:05:55,600 --> 01:05:59,434
She slapped the King.
She's hiding at Mortelame.

870
01:05:59,560 --> 01:06:02,597
I'll marry her, we love each other.

871
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,551
The coincidence is too great.

872
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:06,910
But watch out for Lebel.

873
01:06:07,040 --> 01:06:09,474
And mum's the word.

874
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,114
Hug your son-in-law, Papa.

875
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:14,708
You too, Fier a Bras.

876
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:18,230
Don't forget, mum's the word.

877
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:30,755
Which of you is Sergeant La Franchise?

878
01:06:30,880 --> 01:06:32,233
He is, sir.

879
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:36,319
My name's Lebel,
the King's chamberlain.

880
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:46,114
The King has entrusted me
with a mission you should keep secret.

881
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:49,592
- You have a daughter?
- Yes, sir.

882
01:06:49,720 --> 01:06:51,631
Where is she at this hour?

883
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:56,312
Lucky he who knows.
I haven't seen her all day.

884
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,954
She'll show up soon?

885
01:06:59,080 --> 01:07:00,559
I hope so.

886
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,314
You're a sergeant.

887
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:05,237
Would you like to be an officer?

888
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:07,832
- An officer!
- An officer?

889
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:12,112
Would you like your daughter to be
the wife of a captain or colonel?

890
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:17,030
With a royal dowry and the King
as godfather to her children?

891
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:21,352
You can make this dream come true.

892
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:24,793
Just inform me of Adeline's return.

893
01:07:27,040 --> 01:07:28,268
One word, sir.

894
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,716
No reason. I couldn't be
that captain or colonel?

895
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:34,398
Why not?

896
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:37,273
I'll be as good a husband.

897
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:39,516
Why not? But first,

898
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:45,351
the King must tire of the charms
of the young person in question.

899
01:07:45,480 --> 01:07:50,235
I'm in no hurry.
With my future assured, I can wait.

900
01:07:52,280 --> 01:07:54,316
She's at the convent of Mortelame.

901
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,271
Why didn't you say so?

902
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,789
At first I doubted your identity,

903
01:07:58,920 --> 01:08:02,071
but your words inspire confidence.

904
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:06,992
I'm happy to be of service
to His Majesty with honour and dignity.

905
01:08:07,120 --> 01:08:11,989
To serve the King is to serve
the glory of the kingdom of France.

906
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:14,236
You're only a sergeant?

907
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:16,351
We shall think of you.

908
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:20,792
For you have all the required faults
to obtain the vilest of honours.

909
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:23,791
If I understand correctly,

910
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:27,230
the King is not immune
to Adeline's charms.

911
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:31,037
I knew there was something
about her.

912
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:35,593
If you become colonel,
I shall be your general.

913
01:08:35,720 --> 01:08:37,278
Why not a field marshal?

914
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:40,073
- Monsieur Lebel.
- Yes?

915
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:46,558
May I draw your attention
to the soldier Fanfan La Tulipe?

916
01:08:46,680 --> 01:08:50,514
If we are to succeed,
he should be taken care of.

917
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:53,359
Adeline will never submit to the King

918
01:08:53,480 --> 01:08:55,072
as long as she loves Fanfan.

919
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:58,112
She'll love him unto death.
Thus...

920
01:08:59,040 --> 01:09:00,996
I like you.

921
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:05,669
You have a noble spirit,
you should be in my service.

922
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:09,393
Be at the Cornette Inn at dawn

923
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,671
to take command of a few stout men.

924
01:09:13,480 --> 01:09:16,438
We shall seize Adeline in her refuge.

925
01:09:17,040 --> 01:09:20,396
As for Fanfan,
we shall deal with him...

926
01:09:21,280 --> 01:09:23,236
in our best interest.

927
01:09:45,840 --> 01:09:48,513
Feeling better? How's life?

928
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:53,714
My head feels as if a chicken
were hatching in it.

929
01:09:53,840 --> 01:09:56,877
- We drank too much last night.
- We did.

930
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:59,992
Good morning, father-in-law!

931
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:04,316
- Why so glum?
- I'm a bastard.

932
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,908
- Why?
- I'm a swine.

933
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:09,918
Judas would spit on me.

934
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:14,793
Monsieur Lebel came last night.
Now he knows where Adeline is.

935
01:10:15,680 --> 01:10:18,353
- You told him?
- Not I, Fier a Bras.

936
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:20,391
But I didn't stop him.

937
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:23,478
Now they're on their way
to kidnap Adeline.

938
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:27,593
- What are you saying?
- Simple, I make myself sick.

939
01:10:27,720 --> 01:10:30,359
- When did they leave?
- Three pipes ago.

940
01:10:30,920 --> 01:10:32,433
One more thing.

941
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,677
They've also decided to kill you.

942
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:39,636
You're not forgetting anything?

943
01:10:40,520 --> 01:10:42,033
There's nothing else?

944
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,071
No, that's it for now.

945
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,714
- I'd like to be five days older.
- Why?

946
01:10:46,840 --> 01:10:52,597
I'll be dead by then,
that's when we attack the enemy.

947
01:10:52,720 --> 01:10:55,951
No one will be sorry, not even me.

948
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:57,195
But why?

949
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:00,356
Tranche-Montagne, come!

950
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:22,633
Help me, sister.
I've been wounded by bandits.

951
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,318
Come in, my child.

952
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,189
This way.

953
01:13:07,040 --> 01:13:08,155
Careful!

954
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:22,911
The brutes!

955
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:26,998
Get back.

956
01:13:57,000 --> 01:13:58,149
Hold on!

957
01:14:31,840 --> 01:14:35,310
It's up to the two of us now,
the four of us.

958
01:14:50,120 --> 01:14:51,473
Through here!

959
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:17,353
Help!

960
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,354
Take that, Fier a Bras!

961
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,232
Where did he go? This way.

962
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:55,349
I'm coming, Fanfan.

963
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,192
Help, La Franchise!

964
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:26,914
I've got you now, Fanfan.
No more tulips.

965
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:28,996
There'll be tulips on your grave.

966
01:16:50,920 --> 01:16:52,114
Let go of me!

967
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:17,430
They've taken Adeline!

968
01:18:24,960 --> 01:18:26,279
Follow me.

969
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:32,712
<i>But is this not a flag?</i>

970
01:19:33,320 --> 01:19:36,915
<i>It belongs to the astonished,
disconcerted enemy.</i>

971
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,388
<i>In the excitement
of pursuing the carriage,</i>

972
01:19:40,520 --> 01:19:43,478
<i>both parties had ventured</i>

973
01:19:43,600 --> 01:19:46,114
<i>behind enemy lines.</i>

974
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:49,118
<i>The enemy thought,
"Is this a manoeuvre?"</i>

975
01:19:49,240 --> 01:19:51,708
<i>"The enemy has deceived us!"</i>

976
01:19:56,280 --> 01:20:00,717
<i>Couriers were instantly dispatched
to Marshal Brandeburg's HQ.</i>

977
01:20:00,840 --> 01:20:04,310
<i>A noted strategist,
this Marshal Brandeburg.</i>

978
01:20:05,720 --> 01:20:09,395
<i>He was given
a coherent report by the couriers.</i>

979
01:20:19,000 --> 01:20:23,073
<i>Aware of the situation,
he took matters in hand.</i>

980
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:34,316
<i>With the genius of improvisation,
he ordered</i>

981
01:20:34,440 --> 01:20:37,273
<i>an attack from a surprise quarter.</i>

982
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:41,678
<i>Moments later, couriers ran
to give out the marshal's orders.</i>

983
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:45,588
<i>Infantry and cavalry about-faced,</i>

984
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:50,635
<i>the artillery
swivelled right behind them.</i>

985
01:20:50,760 --> 01:20:53,877
<i>He had turned the tables completely.</i>

986
01:20:54,200 --> 01:20:55,997
Your Majesty...

987
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:59,749
<i>Louis XV was no less disconcerted</i>

988
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:02,030
<i>by the enemy's behaviour.</i>

989
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:05,709
<i>What was the meaning
of this about-face</i>

990
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:07,796
<i>which upset his plans?</i>

991
01:21:09,200 --> 01:21:11,668
<i>The somewhat troubled Louis XV</i>

992
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,995
<i>tried vainly to understand.</i>

993
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:16,031
<i>He thought:</i>

994
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:20,069
<i>"How very disobliging of them
to turn their backs. "</i>

995
01:21:20,200 --> 01:21:23,476
<i>"Does the enemy
fear another enemy?"</i>

996
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,640
<i>"Or are they letting us down?"</i>

997
01:21:26,880 --> 01:21:28,598
What are they doing?

998
01:21:30,160 --> 01:21:32,594
This manoeuvre escapes me.

999
01:21:33,960 --> 01:21:35,313
<i>Meanwhile...</i>

1000
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,352
Faster, faster!

1001
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:48,749
Faster!

1002
01:24:14,280 --> 01:24:15,918
Adeline, jump!

1003
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,239
Don't be afraid.

1004
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:43,392
So you do love me a little?

1005
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:46,080
I never chased a woman so hard.

1006
01:24:46,600 --> 01:24:49,512
- I adore you.
- You said you didn't love me.

1007
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,756
- You believed me?
- Of course not.

1008
01:24:56,440 --> 01:24:58,396
Tranche-Montagne!
Look out, Fanfan.

1009
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:00,554
We're out of powder.

1010
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:46,510
- Are you wounded?
- I don't know.

1011
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,436
- Where's Adeline?
- They got her.

1012
01:25:49,560 --> 01:25:51,676
- Got her? How?
- Watch out!

1013
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:56,155
Quick!

1014
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,313
It looks like...

1015
01:26:24,720 --> 01:26:26,676
Look, there's a cave.

1016
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:29,075
It must lead somewhere.
What's the risk?

1017
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,156
- To find our way.
- Let's go.

1018
01:28:04,640 --> 01:28:05,868
What are they saying?

1019
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:08,116
<i>That things have gone wrong,</i>

1020
01:28:08,240 --> 01:28:12,028
<i>the French are facing the wrong way.</i>

1021
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:16,073
<i>So open fire, gentlemen,
and close the windows.</i>

1022
01:28:41,560 --> 01:28:45,872
<i>We must advance in the direction
we would normally retreat.</i>

1023
01:28:46,680 --> 01:28:49,831
<i>I don't know what
the French HQ was thinking.</i>

1024
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:52,554
<i>No guards,
no artillery preparation...</i>

1025
01:29:00,800 --> 01:29:01,835
Hands up!

1026
01:29:03,040 --> 01:29:04,439
Close the doors!

1027
01:29:04,840 --> 01:29:06,751
Let's go. Move it.

1028
01:29:07,360 --> 01:29:09,590
Everybody in here.

1029
01:29:13,480 --> 01:29:14,754
Next!

1030
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,239
If you try to escape,
you'll be shot.

1031
01:29:21,440 --> 01:29:22,555
Good work!

1032
01:29:24,520 --> 01:29:26,397
They're loaded. Cock them.

1033
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,194
You go upstairs. Hurry up.

1034
01:29:42,640 --> 01:29:44,631
No one. Barricade the door!

1035
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,589
The table.

1036
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,596
Take the pistols.

1037
01:29:58,080 --> 01:29:59,593
Fire at will.

1038
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:23,513
Bravo, Papa!

1039
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:48,152
<i>The enemy realized
their HQ had been captured.</i>

1040
01:30:48,280 --> 01:30:49,713
<i>Terror-stricken,</i>

1041
01:30:49,840 --> 01:30:52,718
<i>the soldiers fled in all directions.</i>

1042
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:56,713
<i>The rout was all the more complete</i>

1043
01:30:56,840 --> 01:30:58,353
<i>in that Fanfan...</i>

1044
01:31:13,200 --> 01:31:17,193
A white flag?
Is Marshal Brandeburg surrendering?

1045
01:31:17,320 --> 01:31:20,630
Indeed he is, but to whom?
To whom?

1046
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:24,598
Yes, to whom? How very strange.

1047
01:31:24,880 --> 01:31:29,908
I'd like to know who has dared
to dispose of our enemy,

1048
01:31:30,040 --> 01:31:34,113
and rob us of our rightful victory?

1049
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:38,597
But look at them,
they're surrendering to us.

1050
01:31:38,720 --> 01:31:39,914
It's a rout.

1051
01:31:40,040 --> 01:31:44,079
I knew we would win.
I knew we would be lucky.

1052
01:31:44,200 --> 01:31:47,237
Luck has never let me down.

1053
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:51,230
We won without firing
a single shot. Wonderful.

1054
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:54,679
Where are your 10,000 dead?

1055
01:31:54,800 --> 01:31:56,950
There's always next time.

1056
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,118
What's this old carriage?

1057
01:32:11,920 --> 01:32:12,909
Sire...

1058
01:32:14,320 --> 01:32:18,359
Forgive the extraordinary vehicle,
Your Majesty.

1059
01:32:18,480 --> 01:32:22,758
I don't know where I've been,
but it must have been far away.

1060
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:26,637
May Your Majesty forgive me,

1061
01:32:26,760 --> 01:32:28,990
but I've lost Adeline.

1062
01:32:29,120 --> 01:32:33,989
Better than myself, the perils
I have suffered will convince...

1063
01:32:34,120 --> 01:32:37,271
Your Majesty, that I remain...

1064
01:32:37,400 --> 01:32:41,791
your very humble
and devoted servant, Lebel.

1065
01:32:46,520 --> 01:32:50,752
Remove the debris,
but take care of the horses.

1066
01:32:51,960 --> 01:32:55,953
Between us, I'd like to know
to whom we owe this victory,

1067
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:58,389
which history will attribute to us.

1068
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:37,433
My compliments, Monsieur La Tulipe.

1069
01:33:37,560 --> 01:33:42,680
It's true that war is too serious
to be left to soldiers.

1070
01:33:43,840 --> 01:33:47,230
You have nevertheless
shown in your operation,

1071
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:50,830
on your initiative
and without our authority,

1072
01:33:50,960 --> 01:33:52,916
talents worthy of generals.

1073
01:33:53,040 --> 01:33:54,314
I name you captain.

1074
01:33:55,920 --> 01:34:00,869
Your destiny, you say,
is to marry your King's daughter.

1075
01:34:01,840 --> 01:34:05,594
And so you shall.
I offer you my daughter's hand.

1076
01:34:05,720 --> 01:34:09,190
I offer providence a helping hand.

1077
01:34:09,320 --> 01:34:13,199
To you I offer my adopted daughter,
Adeline La Franchise.

1078
01:34:18,640 --> 01:34:20,073
She's worthy of you,

1079
01:34:20,200 --> 01:34:23,795
for she has bravely resisted
all advances.

1080
01:34:23,920 --> 01:34:27,071
You, Tranche-Montagne,
shall be sergeant-major.

1081
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:32,152
You, La Franchise, I name you
father-in-law with triple pay.

1082
01:34:39,200 --> 01:34:40,349
As for us,

1083
01:34:40,480 --> 01:34:42,675
we wish the three of you

1084
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:46,429
joy, happiness and prosperity.
