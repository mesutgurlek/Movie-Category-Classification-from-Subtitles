1
00:00:20,937 --> 00:00:22,427
Seventeen ninety-seven...

2
00:00:22,605 --> 00:00:26,268
...the year of the mutinies
of the fleet at Spithead and at the Nore...

3
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:29,241
...and of the continuing war
with republican France.

4
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:34,676
August the 16th, His Majesty's
frigate, Avenger, on a wartime cruise...

5
00:00:34,851 --> 00:00:39,550
...with orders to reinforce
the British squadron off the coast of Spain.

6
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:45,118
John Claggart, master-at-arms,
royal navy.

7
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,890
Edwin Fairfax Vere,
post captain, royal navy.

8
00:00:49,065 --> 00:00:53,331
The Dansker, sailmaker.

9
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:56,699
Philip Seymour, first lieutenant.

10
00:00:56,873 --> 00:00:59,535
Julian Ratcliffe, second lieutenant.

11
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:02,007
Steven Wyatt, gunnery officer.

12
00:01:02,178 --> 00:01:04,703
Enoch Jenkins, maintopman.

13
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:07,645
Squeak, assistant to Mr. Claggart.

14
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,047
Alan Payne, maintopman.

15
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,848
William O'Daniel, maintopman.

16
00:01:13,022 --> 00:01:15,650
Arnold Talbot, maintopman.

17
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:18,521
Neil Kincaid, maintopman.

18
00:01:18,695 --> 00:01:22,290
Alfred Hallam, captain of marines.

19
00:01:23,867 --> 00:01:26,165
On the same day, at the same hour...

20
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:29,203
...the merchant ship, Rights of Man,
out of Dundee...

21
00:01:29,372 --> 00:01:33,274
...bound for the West Indies
with a cargo of manufactured goods.

22
00:01:35,812 --> 00:01:38,679
Nathaniel Graveling, ship's master.

23
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,009
Amos Leonard, first mate.

24
00:01:41,184 --> 00:01:44,551
Charles Mathews, merchant seaman.

25
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:48,623
Billy Budd, merchant seaman.

26
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:06,299
- Down a little.
- Down a little, sir.

27
00:03:06,469 --> 00:03:10,565
Weren't it better to heave to, sir?
She's a man-of-war.

28
00:03:11,241 --> 00:03:12,936
Not an enemy, is she?

29
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,304
No, sir, she's British.

30
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,142
Her name's the Rights of Man, sir.

31
00:03:19,315 --> 00:03:21,840
It's a dangerous name for a vessel
in this day and age.

32
00:03:22,018 --> 00:03:23,952
- Is she heaving to?
- No, sir.

33
00:03:24,854 --> 00:03:28,051
Aye. It's worse than any enemy.

34
00:03:28,224 --> 00:03:30,692
If she's British, I'll not heave to.

35
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,328
If she's French,
she only wants to sink us.

36
00:03:33,496 --> 00:03:37,091
Every seaman leads his life
in the expectation of being sunk.

37
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:41,601
If she's British, she'll want to take my best
men from me, and I'll not stand for that.

38
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:43,966
Hoist the topgallants.

39
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:46,540
Hoist the topgallants!

40
00:03:46,743 --> 00:03:48,005
Hey, Budd.

41
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,311
Billy Budd, give us a song.

42
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:56,281
They calls me Hanging Johnny

43
00:03:56,452 --> 00:04:00,616
Away, boys, away

44
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:04,954
They says I hangs for money

45
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:09,360
All hang, boys, hang

46
00:04:09,532 --> 00:04:13,628
At first I hanged my Sally

47
00:04:13,803 --> 00:04:17,739
Away, boys, away

48
00:04:17,907 --> 00:04:22,401
And then I hanged my family

49
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,611
She's hoisting more canvas.

50
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:29,916
- They appear to be singing, sir.
- Yes.

51
00:04:30,086 --> 00:04:32,646
Are they so ignorant
they cannot understand our purpose?

52
00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:37,088
Oh, I doubt that it's ignorance
which motivates their actions, Mr. Ratcliffe.

53
00:04:37,527 --> 00:04:39,518
Captain Hallam.

54
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:43,131
- Sir?
- We all envy your word of command.

55
00:04:43,299 --> 00:04:45,859
Tell them to heave to, if you will,
with my compliments.

56
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:47,502
Ta.

57
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:51,431
Away, boys, away

58
00:04:51,607 --> 00:04:53,541
Captain's compliments...

59
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,113
...will you heave to?
- Captain, they're ordering us to heave to.

60
00:04:58,281 --> 00:05:01,114
There can be no mistaking
their meaning now.

61
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:04,980
That don't prevent me
being a bit hard of hearing, do it?

62
00:05:05,288 --> 00:05:07,279
- Fall off.
- Fall off, sir.

63
00:05:07,457 --> 00:05:09,357
I'll get the best I can out of her.

64
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,661
She appears to be falling off
to make a fair wind of it, sir.

65
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,534
You sure she's not a Frenchman
in disguise, sir?

66
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,801
Nothing so adventurous,
I'm afraid, Ratcliffe.

67
00:05:27,977 --> 00:05:30,241
Her refusal to heave to
proves she's one of ours.

68
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,779
But I will be obeyed.

69
00:05:32,949 --> 00:05:35,144
Send a shot across her bows.

70
00:05:35,318 --> 00:05:38,014
We're at war, Mr. Seymour.

71
00:05:38,187 --> 00:05:40,417
Fire the bow chaser!

72
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,132
Well, I can't pretend
to be blind too, can I?

73
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:58,570
Back the main yard, Mr. Mate.

74
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,574
Backing the main yard, sir?

75
00:06:04,747 --> 00:06:08,410
There's no avoiding it, man.
Get up on the focs'le.

76
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:24,164
If I spit now,
I'd get him fair and square, man.

77
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,324
Why do you waste it on him?
He's not so bad.

78
00:06:26,502 --> 00:06:28,732
There's no difference
between any of them.

79
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:41,239
Cast off forward.

80
00:06:41,417 --> 00:06:43,442
And what do you want, then?

81
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:45,553
Down oars.

82
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:48,183
All together.

83
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:02,561
All hands on deck.

84
00:07:02,738 --> 00:07:05,571
All hands right over to the focs'le.

85
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:12,574
Budd. Billy Budd. Get up aloft again.
Maybe they won't see you.

86
00:07:25,161 --> 00:07:27,561
Men lined up already, captain?

87
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:30,255
There's no doubt about your intentions.

88
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,692
Is that why you failed
to obey our order?

89
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,738
I never thought I'd see the day when
I'd pray for a French sail on the horizon.

90
00:07:37,907 --> 00:07:40,034
A French sail? Why?

91
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:42,769
Then the royal navy
could do its duty for a change...

92
00:07:42,945 --> 00:07:45,539
...protect our merchant ships
instead of preying on them.

93
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,183
You have ideas of your own, captain.

94
00:07:48,351 --> 00:07:50,319
I'm not alone in that.

95
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:16,237
What's this man's record?

96
00:08:16,546 --> 00:08:19,674
- Good.
- He looks a likely man.

97
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:22,579
What, with the whole of the Nore
and the mutiny?

98
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,813
Who's the likely man now, lieutenant?
Aye, there was officers killed and all.

99
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:29,885
Where did you hear this?

100
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:31,720
Aye, it's common knowledge.

101
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:34,727
We're not long out of port.
The mainland's buzzing with it.

102
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:38,424
Read the newspapers. They're talking
about reforms in the House of Commons.

103
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:39,829
You know what that means.

104
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:42,732
It means the reforms
are nearly a century overdue.

105
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:58,416
- Who is that?
- Billy. Billy Budd.

106
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:01,385
According to the rights of war...

107
00:09:01,557 --> 00:09:04,321
...a man-of-war can impress a seaman
from any other vessel.

108
00:09:04,493 --> 00:09:06,825
- Do you understand that, Billy?
- Aye, captain.

109
00:09:06,996 --> 00:09:09,123
You also understand
there's nothing I can do?

110
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:10,697
Aye, captain.

111
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:13,868
You understand too much too well.

112
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:15,867
Are you at least sorry to be leaving?

113
00:09:16,038 --> 00:09:19,371
Aye, that I am, captain.
It's a good ship, this.

114
00:09:19,842 --> 00:09:21,639
You helped make it good.

115
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,473
A man-of-war, you'll find, is different.

116
00:09:25,248 --> 00:09:27,443
- Different, sir?
- Aye, Billy.

117
00:09:28,618 --> 00:09:32,179
Do your work well, keep your mouth shut,
except at meal times.

118
00:09:33,356 --> 00:09:35,517
It's not as it is here.

119
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:39,552
Now, there's a good lad.
Go forward and get your gear.

120
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:41,356
Aye, captain.

121
00:09:56,712 --> 00:09:58,270
My compliments to your captain.

122
00:09:58,447 --> 00:10:01,610
Tell him I regret
I do not command a faster ship.

123
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:06,378
Cast off forward.

124
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:09,957
Take that oar.

125
00:10:10,393 --> 00:10:12,327
Up together.

126
00:10:32,081 --> 00:10:34,345
God go with you, Billy Budd...

127
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:37,645
...for it's a fact that you go with God.

128
00:10:38,187 --> 00:10:40,348
Goodbye to you all.

129
00:10:40,990 --> 00:10:44,448
- Goodbye to you too, old Rights of Man.
- What do you mean by that, boy?

130
00:10:47,596 --> 00:10:49,393
Nothing, sir.

131
00:10:57,173 --> 00:11:01,109
- All that trouble for only one man.
- Must be a reason, sir.

132
00:11:01,277 --> 00:11:03,211
Oh, yes, I can imagine the reason...

133
00:11:03,379 --> 00:11:06,644
...knowing the temper
of that vessel's master.

134
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:10,775
- Well, Seymour, our choice better be good.
- Get a rope down.

135
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:28,097
Do you swear to abide
by the Articles of War, to obey orders...

136
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:32,434
...and, if need be, to lay down your life
for king and country?

137
00:11:32,608 --> 00:11:34,371
Aye, sir.

138
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,546
Like that?

139
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:50,815
- Say ''I swear.''
- I swear.

140
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,885
- Age?
- I don't know, sir.

141
00:11:54,663 --> 00:11:59,157
- You don't know your age?
- That is, sir, I'm not quite sure.

142
00:12:00,069 --> 00:12:02,833
I think 17, 19, or...

143
00:12:03,539 --> 00:12:05,234
Or...

144
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,375
Eighteen?

145
00:12:08,811 --> 00:12:11,279
Or 15 or 14?

146
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:16,780
- Place of birth?
- Please, sir, I don't know that either.

147
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:19,647
You don't know your age
or where you were born?

148
00:12:20,189 --> 00:12:23,090
I was found one morning
in a silk-lined basket...

149
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:25,659
...hanging on the knocker
of a man's door in Bristol.

150
00:12:26,028 --> 00:12:28,087
Silk-lined?

151
00:12:30,099 --> 00:12:32,033
I take it then you're...

152
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:34,328
- A bastard, sir?
- Aye.

153
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:35,902
Aye.

154
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:42,333
Sign.

155
00:12:55,524 --> 00:12:56,889
Master-at-arms.

156
00:12:57,793 --> 00:13:00,227
Claggart, our new recruit, William Budd.

157
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,225
I suppose that is your name?

158
00:13:04,066 --> 00:13:05,363
Aye, sir.

159
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:12,030
You look sturdy enough.

160
00:13:12,441 --> 00:13:14,466
What was your station aboard?

161
00:13:14,643 --> 00:13:16,406
I was a merchant seaman, sir.

162
00:13:16,579 --> 00:13:18,604
We took turns at doing everything.

163
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:20,772
You'll have a station here.

164
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:23,885
Maintop, Jenkins' watch.

165
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:26,817
Squeak, take him below,
assign him a hammock...

166
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:28,581
...show him where to stow his gear.

167
00:13:28,757 --> 00:13:31,692
- Aye, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

168
00:13:33,496 --> 00:13:37,933
Well, life's full of surprises,
I always say.

169
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,193
And the better for it, Captain Hallam.

170
00:13:49,445 --> 00:13:51,003
Here, mate.

171
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:54,706
- Back here?
- Yeah.

172
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:56,817
This is your hammock.

173
00:13:57,820 --> 00:14:01,381
All hands on deck
to witness ship's punishment.

174
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:05,382
Best put down your bag, Budd.
It'll only be a matter of minutes.

175
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,226
Dansker, look after Budd.

176
00:15:10,626 --> 00:15:12,150
Boatswain...

177
00:15:13,629 --> 00:15:15,290
...do your duty.

178
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:33,771
Very well, boatswain.

179
00:16:35,678 --> 00:16:37,305
Release the man.

180
00:16:41,316 --> 00:16:42,806
Mr. Ferriman...

181
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:46,049
...you will see him to sick berth.

182
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:51,486
Ship's company, dismiss.

183
00:16:54,596 --> 00:16:56,257
Away there, mate.

184
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:59,995
What was his crime?

185
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:03,502
God only knows, young man.

186
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,505
You mean you don't know what he did?

187
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:11,339
Flogging...

188
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:15,143
...is the only solution to every problem.

189
00:17:17,019 --> 00:17:21,012
I warrant even the culprit himself
doesn't know.

190
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,217
It was just his turn.

191
00:17:44,513 --> 00:17:46,413
What is it, Budd?

192
00:17:47,382 --> 00:17:50,681
Did they not indulge in flogging
on the Rights of Man?

193
00:18:01,130 --> 00:18:02,961
No, sir.

194
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,365
All right, Budd.

195
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,746
You'll keep your hammock
properly lashed in this manner.

196
00:18:26,922 --> 00:18:28,913
Never get caught
with your bag out of order.

197
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:31,753
You wouldn't be wanting
to find yourself on ship's report.

198
00:18:31,927 --> 00:18:34,862
Like the lad who was flogged.

199
00:18:35,097 --> 00:18:39,193
- Why was he flogged?
- It could've been for one of many reasons.

200
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:41,268
You mean you don't know?

201
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:46,070
It's not for the likes of us to know,
just to witness, see?

202
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:49,206
- Hungry?
- Aye.

203
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:53,681
Well, this is the captain
of the maintop, Jenkins.

204
00:18:54,516 --> 00:18:58,008
Right, Budd, this is your table.
Make room for him.

205
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,823
All events, you're welcome here, lad.

206
00:19:02,991 --> 00:19:05,482
Here, boy, take my seat.

207
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:07,686
Here's a plate.

208
00:19:08,297 --> 00:19:11,733
His first day
aboard our happy ship.

209
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,160
What was the ship
they impressed you off?

210
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:16,099
I couldn't read it at that distance.

211
00:19:16,271 --> 00:19:18,205
You can't read at any distance.

212
00:19:18,373 --> 00:19:21,274
Don't take offense,
you're in good company.

213
00:19:21,443 --> 00:19:23,468
I can't read either.

214
00:19:23,812 --> 00:19:28,044
She was called the Rights of Man.

215
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:31,075
You come off a ship called that?

216
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:33,153
Rights of Man?

217
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:35,753
My name's William.

218
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,291
Billy, if you like.

219
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:46,534
Oh, this is Payne, Kincaid,
Jenkins, O'Daniel, and I'm Talbot.

220
00:19:46,702 --> 00:19:49,102
Oh, and that...
That old tar there's called Dansker.

221
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:52,635
He's Danish. Or he thinks he is.

222
00:19:54,243 --> 00:19:57,474
Dansker, have you ever had a real name?

223
00:19:59,381 --> 00:20:01,474
Not for many years.

224
00:20:04,419 --> 00:20:07,013
Why don't you spit in the stew?
It can't taste no worse.

225
00:20:07,189 --> 00:20:10,420
Nobody's making you eat it.
You can wash your feet in it if you like.

226
00:20:10,592 --> 00:20:13,755
It seems the cook already has.
There's a splinter in it anyway.

227
00:20:14,596 --> 00:20:16,962
That's enough of laughing
at my deformity.

228
00:20:17,132 --> 00:20:19,157
Do you ever bring yourself
to eat this dirt?

229
00:20:19,334 --> 00:20:21,302
I can't cook, you know that.

230
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:25,338
They only gave me this employment
because I'm unfit for active service.

231
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:27,304
You ought to be ashamed of yourselves.

232
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:30,538
Well, Billy,
there's the royal navy for you.

233
00:20:30,879 --> 00:20:32,107
Can you cook?

234
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:34,146
I can make a stew.

235
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,784
From now on,
I'll be praying that you lose a leg.

236
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:45,253
Like it, Billy? Taste good?

237
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:48,795
It's hot, and there's a lot of it.

238
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,793
I like everything about it
except the flavor.

239
00:20:56,505 --> 00:20:58,973
And how do you like the company,
Billy boy?

240
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:01,241
Not quite what you're used to?

241
00:21:02,244 --> 00:21:05,270
Ever seen so much ignorance
all dumped together in one place?

242
00:21:05,447 --> 00:21:08,245
Ever heard such a din
as these gentlemen eating?

243
00:21:08,417 --> 00:21:10,044
Let the lad be, Jenkins.

244
00:21:10,218 --> 00:21:11,879
Baby has to learn.

245
00:21:12,454 --> 00:21:16,015
There'll be others to teach him
soon enough.

246
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:17,783
He's in my watch.

247
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:21,794
Would you have him learn lashed to the
grating with his lesson written on his back?

248
00:21:21,964 --> 00:21:23,898
Why was that man flogged?

249
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:29,493
He may have spat against the wind...

250
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:32,864
...or mumbled in his beard.

251
00:21:33,809 --> 00:21:36,471
It may have been a prayer.

252
00:21:37,946 --> 00:21:40,608
To them, it was a protest.

253
00:21:41,483 --> 00:21:43,576
You don't know why.

254
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:51,025
It's wrong to flog a man.

255
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:53,994
I...

256
00:22:13,315 --> 00:22:15,715
It's against his being a man.

257
00:22:16,985 --> 00:22:18,111
Aye.

258
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:19,651
Aye, lad, it is that.

259
00:22:21,223 --> 00:22:24,818
Why do you stammer, boy?

260
00:22:29,798 --> 00:22:33,427
Because I sometimes
can't find the words...

261
00:22:34,302 --> 00:22:36,702
...for what I feel.

262
00:22:38,373 --> 00:22:41,433
Our young bastard's stammering
because he's scared.

263
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,237
Leave him alone.

264
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:47,844
Come on, ba... Ba... Baby.
T... Talk back, why don't you?

265
00:22:48,283 --> 00:22:50,843
- Is it a fight you want, then?
- Aye...

266
00:22:51,253 --> 00:22:54,711
...for your own good,
and my satisfaction.

267
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,859
I want to baptize you
in the ways of our world.

268
00:22:58,527 --> 00:23:02,327
There was a lad on the Rights of Man
who used to like a friendly fight.

269
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,990
Name of Mathews.

270
00:23:21,683 --> 00:23:24,311
- Come on, Jenkins, do something.
- Go on.

271
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:25,919
- Go on.
- Go on, have a go.

272
00:23:26,088 --> 00:23:28,921
Well, you asked for it, didn't you?
Ba... Ba... Baby.

273
00:23:29,858 --> 00:23:31,758
I'll get you in a minute.

274
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:34,920
- Come on.
- Come on.

275
00:23:35,097 --> 00:23:36,655
Come on.

276
00:24:19,141 --> 00:24:20,165
- Hang on.
- Come on, Billy.

277
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:22,810
- Hold him down.
- Come on, Billy.

278
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:24,036
Steady.

279
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:25,645
Jenkins.

280
00:24:25,814 --> 00:24:29,181
- Jenkins. Easy.
- Hold on, Billy.

281
00:24:29,518 --> 00:24:32,385
Turn your head, Billy. Turn your head.

282
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:42,828
All right, I'll let you off this time...

283
00:24:42,998 --> 00:24:45,865
...but don't do it again, boy-o.
I'm warning you.

284
00:24:46,768 --> 00:24:49,066
- Will you shake hands, mate?
- Shake hands, is it?

285
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:52,138
- You're a hell of a peacemaker, Billy.
- Well, you beat me fair.

286
00:24:52,307 --> 00:24:54,707
That's the first time
I ever hear him eat his words.

287
00:24:54,876 --> 00:24:58,539
And what a terrible diet that is.
Worse than the stew.

288
00:24:59,214 --> 00:25:01,682
Don't you be getting any wrong ideas.
I'm warning you.

289
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:04,114
- I'm more than a match for you, boy-o.
- Aye.

290
00:25:04,286 --> 00:25:07,153
- I took you off your guard.
- Aye.

291
00:25:15,030 --> 00:25:17,931
You make friends quickly, Master Budd.

292
00:25:19,768 --> 00:25:21,531
Come here, boy.

293
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:27,000
What was the fight about?

294
00:25:27,809 --> 00:25:29,606
Well, I...

295
00:25:35,417 --> 00:25:37,180
Nothing to say.

296
00:25:39,487 --> 00:25:40,749
And the rest of you?

297
00:25:50,265 --> 00:25:51,493
Mr. Claggart.

298
00:25:53,935 --> 00:25:55,459
Watch what you're doing.

299
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:58,932
Don't you ever touch me.

300
00:25:59,107 --> 00:26:02,076
- I swear...
- You swear.

301
00:26:03,044 --> 00:26:04,375
What?

302
00:26:08,683 --> 00:26:11,311
None of you have anything to say?

303
00:26:16,858 --> 00:26:21,522
It was nothing, master-at-arms.

304
00:26:21,997 --> 00:26:23,862
A test of strength.

305
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:32,265
You'll need your strength
for the fighting to come, boy.

306
00:26:35,777 --> 00:26:37,369
Aye, Budd.

307
00:26:39,247 --> 00:26:42,910
You do indeed make friends quickly.

308
00:26:45,987 --> 00:26:48,148
That's a good quality to have.

309
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,597
Billy...

310
00:27:06,508 --> 00:27:10,342
...be careful of the master-at-arms.

311
00:27:10,512 --> 00:27:13,777
Careful? Why?

312
00:27:14,382 --> 00:27:16,907
He had a pleasant smile for me.

313
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:20,420
That's why.

314
00:27:37,272 --> 00:27:40,833
Make eight bells!

315
00:28:00,028 --> 00:28:03,395
- First watch aboard a man-of-war, Billy?
- Hey, don't fall.

316
00:28:03,565 --> 00:28:05,328
Or jump.

317
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:08,535
Come on, get up there.

318
00:28:17,879 --> 00:28:21,007
Aye, he's quite a hand for jokes.

319
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:23,514
Always cheerful too.

320
00:28:23,685 --> 00:28:26,745
Always smiling, waving at people.

321
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:30,789
Lovely little character. Always...

322
00:28:32,293 --> 00:28:34,352
Afternoon, sir.

323
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:38,156
Wind seems to be freshening a little.
With your permission, sir.

324
00:28:38,333 --> 00:28:41,496
''Freshening'' did you say,
master-at-arms?

325
00:28:41,669 --> 00:28:46,106
Yes, it is indeed,
master-at-arms. Indeed.

326
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,996
Our young newcomer
seems to feel quite at home.

327
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,642
Aye, sir. Indeed he does.

328
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:23,368
Yes.

329
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:35,847
He's even melted
old starry Vere's stone heart.

330
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,888
He'll make the old Avenger
a merchantman yet.

331
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:44,192
The trouble is I just can't find
the distances like I used to.

332
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:47,493
I'll take your turn tomorrow
while you stay below decks.

333
00:29:57,679 --> 00:29:59,306
Who's there?

334
00:30:03,284 --> 00:30:05,878
Well, what's up, then, Squeak?

335
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:08,545
Routine inspection, Jenkins.

336
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,484
What's the matter? Sick, are you?

337
00:30:11,659 --> 00:30:14,321
My health does not concern you.

338
00:30:14,496 --> 00:30:16,726
No need to be uncivil, Jenkins.

339
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:21,460
Is this sickness something
master-at-arms should know about?

340
00:30:21,636 --> 00:30:23,729
He'll know
when I want him to know, boy-o.

341
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:26,772
Well, I hope it's nothing serious.

342
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,075
- Evening.
- Good evening.

343
00:30:34,716 --> 00:30:39,415
Oh, it's on a petty report
you are again, Budd.

344
00:30:39,587 --> 00:30:42,715
Well, I mean, look at it.

345
00:30:43,791 --> 00:30:46,419
It's a pity you will not learn.

346
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:57,132
I don't understand.

347
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:59,967
That's the second time
it's happened like this.

348
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:02,268
Well, next time,
sew yourself up in it...

349
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:06,243
...and then you'll be sure to know
if somebody meddles with it.

350
00:31:15,823 --> 00:31:17,757
Oh, Dansker?

351
00:31:18,726 --> 00:31:20,284
What?

352
00:31:29,904 --> 00:31:31,633
Reading?

353
00:31:39,113 --> 00:31:41,445
How many times
must you be on ship's report...

354
00:31:41,616 --> 00:31:45,143
...before they tie you to the gratings
and flog you?

355
00:31:47,822 --> 00:31:51,451
That's a matter he decides.

356
00:31:52,026 --> 00:31:53,550
He?

357
00:31:54,696 --> 00:31:56,630
Aye...

358
00:31:56,798 --> 00:32:01,360
...the master-at-arms, Mr. Claggart.

359
00:32:19,153 --> 00:32:21,587
Go on. That's all you're gonna get.

360
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:24,518
Fish.

361
00:32:25,293 --> 00:32:27,284
They're serving fish.

362
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:29,225
I can't think why.

363
00:32:29,397 --> 00:32:31,160
It's Wednesday.

364
00:32:31,332 --> 00:32:34,824
However, I hope it's better
than that horsemeat we've been getting.

365
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:37,335
Maybe it's a seahorse.

366
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:41,605
Here, Jenkins,
aren't you eating anything?

367
00:32:41,776 --> 00:32:45,337
Well, you've got to eat something,
you know, or go sick.

368
00:32:45,513 --> 00:32:48,482
Well, at least come in out of the sun.

369
00:33:17,311 --> 00:33:19,609
Handsomely done, lad.

370
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:24,043
But then handsome is
as handsome does.

371
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:30,019
Clean up that mess.

372
00:33:35,029 --> 00:33:38,294
I thought that I said,
''Clean up that mess.''

373
00:33:38,466 --> 00:33:41,264
That's the mess boy's job.

374
00:33:41,436 --> 00:33:44,098
It's yours when I order it so.

375
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:46,934
I'll clean it up.
After all, sir, it was I who spilled it.

376
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,076
Stand back, boy.

377
00:34:06,527 --> 00:34:08,586
Might as well clean that up too.

378
00:34:08,763 --> 00:34:11,664
- Sir, he's sick.
- Sick?

379
00:34:11,999 --> 00:34:14,331
I'm sorry to hear that.

380
00:34:15,937 --> 00:34:18,735
Is that what you'd like to do, Jenkins?

381
00:34:19,841 --> 00:34:21,900
Perhaps you'd do it...

382
00:34:22,076 --> 00:34:24,408
...if you weren't so...

383
00:34:24,712 --> 00:34:26,509
So sick.

384
00:34:28,616 --> 00:34:31,107
You others feel well enough, I hope.

385
00:34:31,285 --> 00:34:33,344
Here I am, unarmed.

386
00:34:33,521 --> 00:34:35,512
Now's the time.

387
00:34:38,593 --> 00:34:40,959
To make it easier...

388
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:45,356
...l'll turn my back on you.

389
00:34:50,138 --> 00:34:52,470
You lack fiber, men.

390
00:34:54,075 --> 00:34:57,704
Or have you some more
devious plan for me?

391
00:34:58,546 --> 00:35:01,743
- Some night when there's no moon.
- Don't be a fool.

392
00:35:05,019 --> 00:35:08,182
That's a very good plan indeed.

393
00:35:11,125 --> 00:35:14,652
A plan worthy of pigs like you.

394
00:35:17,965 --> 00:35:20,593
You'll soon feel better, Jenkins.

395
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:26,099
Just keep your hate for me alive
until that time.

396
00:35:33,281 --> 00:35:36,273
Damn his flaming soul.

397
00:35:38,352 --> 00:35:40,047
I can't stand it no more.

398
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:42,121
What are you gonna do about it, mate?

399
00:35:42,290 --> 00:35:45,453
Stick him. Stick him
one of these nights like he said.

400
00:35:46,194 --> 00:35:47,661
He's waiting for it.

401
00:35:47,829 --> 00:35:51,560
Don't do nothing foolish, mate. You can
get hung for no more than an angry look.

402
00:35:51,732 --> 00:35:55,793
Oh, I'm sick of the taste of blood, boy-o.

403
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:57,801
Why is he so friendly to me?

404
00:35:57,972 --> 00:35:59,439
It was I who spilled the food.

405
00:35:59,607 --> 00:36:00,938
Don't you believe it.

406
00:36:01,108 --> 00:36:03,235
It was him lurched into you. I saw it.

407
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,673
I'll ask him why.

408
00:36:04,846 --> 00:36:06,438
No, you don't, Billy.

409
00:36:06,614 --> 00:36:08,241
Not a word, you hear?

410
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:12,477
Just thank your stars he's still
smiling at you, lad, and leave it at that.

411
00:36:12,954 --> 00:36:15,047
He never did smile at me. Never.

412
00:36:15,223 --> 00:36:16,588
Not even the first day.

413
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:20,090
It's all right for you to give advice,
you've had your food. I'm hungry.

414
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:24,061
That don't mean much.
I ate mine, I'm hungry too.

415
00:36:24,365 --> 00:36:26,629
I'll ask him when I get a chance.

416
00:36:26,801 --> 00:36:28,530
I will.

417
00:36:35,643 --> 00:36:38,168
You recommend Budd
for a post of more responsibility...

418
00:36:38,346 --> 00:36:40,439
...yet here's his name
on ship's report again.

419
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,640
These are just misdemeanors.
Nothing serious.

420
00:36:42,817 --> 00:36:44,944
An infraction of any rule is serious.

421
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,019
- Mr. Ratcliffe.
- Sir.

422
00:36:47,188 --> 00:36:48,849
You took him off that merchant ship.

423
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:50,251
When he cried out:

424
00:36:50,424 --> 00:36:54,087
''Goodbye, old Rights of Man,''
what did you take it he meant?

425
00:36:54,528 --> 00:36:56,621
At the time, sir, I wasn't sure.

426
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:59,391
Now I'm sure he meant nothing.

427
00:36:59,567 --> 00:37:02,798
He knew of the shameful mutinies
at the Nore and at Spithead.

428
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,302
It was common gossip
aboard that merchantman.

429
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:07,600
I charged him to keep
the knowledge to himself.

430
00:37:07,775 --> 00:37:10,938
As far as I can ascertain,
he's kept his secret well.

431
00:37:11,112 --> 00:37:13,046
- Must be a hard one to keep.
- Yes.

432
00:37:13,214 --> 00:37:16,615
He was the only man I dared impress,
if you remember, sir.

433
00:37:16,784 --> 00:37:19,014
The boy has a quality of trust.

434
00:37:21,589 --> 00:37:24,080
Thank you, Ratcliffe, that'll be all.

435
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:30,428
- Claggart. What does he recommend?
- I've not discussed it with him, sir.

436
00:37:30,598 --> 00:37:33,795
- Well, why not, pray? The boy has sworn...
- With your permission, sir.

437
00:37:33,968 --> 00:37:36,436
In this matter,
I didn't think it necessary.

438
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:42,675
What do you know about Claggart?

439
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:45,004
Before he came aboard this ship,
I mean.

440
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,012
Not much, sir. Nobody does.

441
00:37:48,182 --> 00:37:49,706
- There are rumors.
- Rumors?

442
00:37:49,884 --> 00:37:52,785
- But then there always are in any ship.
- What rumors?

443
00:37:52,954 --> 00:37:55,218
That he was once arraigned
at the King's Bench...

444
00:37:55,389 --> 00:37:57,323
...on some mysterious charge...

445
00:37:57,491 --> 00:37:59,891
...then volunteered with the king's navy
as payment.

446
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:01,392
How flattering for us.

447
00:38:01,562 --> 00:38:04,497
Too much of the navy
is made up of debtors...

448
00:38:04,665 --> 00:38:08,362
...murderers and drunkards without
the steady legs to escape impressment.

449
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:10,333
If it were not true in his case...

450
00:38:10,504 --> 00:38:14,463
...then why would a man of his intellect
have accepted life aboard ship...

451
00:38:14,642 --> 00:38:18,476
...on such a lowly station?
- Aye. Aye.

452
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:22,275
He's a good master-at-arms, mark you.
He's the best I've ever sailed with.

453
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:23,678
The ship is yours, sir.

454
00:38:23,851 --> 00:38:26,251
- The choice of men to man her too.
- Choice.

455
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:28,615
What master-at-arms
is ever loved by the crew?

456
00:38:28,789 --> 00:38:30,051
Loved?

457
00:38:31,158 --> 00:38:32,147
They hate him, sir.

458
00:38:32,326 --> 00:38:35,318
That may be better than indifference,
Seymour. Who knows?

459
00:38:36,197 --> 00:38:38,859
The fact that I command
does not relieve me from doubts.

460
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:41,433
On the contrary, it magnifies them.

461
00:38:41,602 --> 00:38:44,901
A man-of-war does not come to life
until it's in action.

462
00:38:45,072 --> 00:38:47,438
Will we acquit ourselves well...

463
00:38:47,608 --> 00:38:48,836
...or badly?

464
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:51,945
What kind of a weapon
have we forged?

465
00:38:52,113 --> 00:38:56,174
Or when the time comes,
will I know how to use it?

466
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:01,112
Claggart is a force for order, Mr. Seymour.
A force for order I must have.

467
00:39:01,288 --> 00:39:02,846
Sir...

468
00:39:03,524 --> 00:39:06,584
...if he should be opposed
to Budd's promotion...

469
00:39:07,495 --> 00:39:12,023
You know, Seymour, there are some men
who cannot stand too much perfection.

470
00:39:12,199 --> 00:39:15,225
They see it as a disease...

471
00:39:15,403 --> 00:39:19,464
...which must be stamped out
at its first rash showing.

472
00:39:21,709 --> 00:39:25,736
I will think over
the matter of Budd's promotion.

473
00:39:39,593 --> 00:39:41,788
- What's the matter with him?
- What is it, mate?

474
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:44,795
Oh, it's no good, boy-o. I feel sick.

475
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:46,626
Sick and dizzy.

476
00:39:46,801 --> 00:39:49,292
- Come on, let's get aloft.
- No, wait.

477
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,738
Get him down below.

478
00:39:57,545 --> 00:39:59,775
Where are you taking him?

479
00:40:00,214 --> 00:40:01,681
Sick berth.

480
00:40:04,618 --> 00:40:08,520
This sickness
begins to grow tedious, Jenkins.

481
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:10,689
How does it strike you?
In the head?

482
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:12,621
In the limbs?

483
00:40:12,793 --> 00:40:14,761
Maybe in the gut.

484
00:40:14,929 --> 00:40:16,692
Does it exist at all?

485
00:40:17,264 --> 00:40:20,631
- Can't you see?
- We're undermanned.

486
00:40:20,801 --> 00:40:22,735
- Get aloft.
- You can't let a sick man...

487
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:24,666
...hang from a spar like that.

488
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,306
He'll fall, sure.

489
00:40:27,274 --> 00:40:29,572
We're in French waters.

490
00:40:30,077 --> 00:40:33,376
Orders are a man on every spar.
Now, get aloft.

491
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:36,880
- You think I'm shirking?
- Yes, I do.

492
00:40:37,051 --> 00:40:39,144
Then be damned to you.
I'll stand my watch.

493
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:42,448
- At least let the ship's doctor...
- I said I'll stand my watch.

494
00:40:42,623 --> 00:40:43,920
French waters...

495
00:40:44,091 --> 00:40:46,025
...undermanned.

496
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:50,892
That's not why you're sending me aloft,
Mr. Claggart.

497
00:42:09,843 --> 00:42:13,074
A sail one mile off the starboard bow.

498
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,448
A Frenchman. Beat to quarters.
Clear for action.

499
00:42:22,923 --> 00:42:25,153
Beat to quarters! Clear for action!

500
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:32,858
Mr. Seymour, sir.

501
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:42,565
Here, get ahold of that!

502
00:42:42,743 --> 00:42:46,577
Go on, you lazy landlubbers there!
Go on, get ahold of this.

503
00:42:47,615 --> 00:42:50,516
- Move on there, move on.
- Keep moving!

504
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:54,947
Battle stations fully manned, sir.

505
00:42:55,122 --> 00:42:59,354
- Set more sail and give chase.
- We'll never catch her, sir.

506
00:43:02,029 --> 00:43:04,554
- She may not have seen us.
- Aye, aye, sir.

507
00:43:04,732 --> 00:43:07,496
- Set more sail, Mr. Leverett.
- Set more sail, Mr. Seymour.

508
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,693
- Steer close to the wind, sir?
- Aye.

509
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:13,169
- Quartermaster, steer by the wind.
- By the wind it is, sir.

510
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:25,751
Why is that man leaving his post?

511
00:43:27,054 --> 00:43:28,715
Who is it?

512
00:43:29,390 --> 00:43:31,824
- Budd, sir.
- Budd?

513
00:43:48,175 --> 00:43:50,666
For the love of God, Billy...

514
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,172
...look to yourself.

515
00:44:25,279 --> 00:44:27,042
Claggart!

516
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,783
Damn your bloody eyes!

517
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:48,731
The man is dead, Mr. Ratcliffe.

518
00:44:52,005 --> 00:44:55,566
- Take the body below.
- Aye, sir.

519
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:03,874
You, you. Thompson, Ridley.

520
00:45:04,051 --> 00:45:05,951
Bear him below.

521
00:45:11,859 --> 00:45:15,761
- The Frenchman's drawing ahead, sir.
- Commence firing, Mr. Seymour.

522
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:20,423
- But, sir, it's hopeless. It's out of range.
- Yes, Mr. Seymour.

523
00:45:20,768 --> 00:45:23,532
- We can attract other enemy ships...
- I know your objection.

524
00:45:23,704 --> 00:45:27,504
We can't sink the Frenchman. All I can do
is to lessen the tension aboard my ship.

525
00:45:27,674 --> 00:45:29,301
Commence firing, Mr. Seymour.

526
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,842
- Starboard battery, open fire!
- Open fire, sir.

527
00:45:32,012 --> 00:45:34,276
- Fire at will.
- Fire at will!

528
00:45:34,448 --> 00:45:36,473
Fire at will.

529
00:45:39,253 --> 00:45:41,653
- Fire at will!
- What are we firing at?

530
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:45,690
Don't question the commands,
obey them! Fire!

531
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,359
Look out!

532
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:54,862
- Mr. Seymour.
- Sir.

533
00:45:55,035 --> 00:45:59,734
Officers will wear swords all the time
from now on.

534
00:46:13,954 --> 00:46:15,888
We've lost her, sir.

535
00:46:18,225 --> 00:46:21,285
- Give up the chase, Mr. Seymour.
- Aye, aye, sir.

536
00:46:22,262 --> 00:46:24,822
What else do you expect me
to tell you?

537
00:46:25,766 --> 00:46:27,859
Hand in your arms.

538
00:46:34,908 --> 00:46:37,376
Oh, Kincaid.

539
00:46:41,048 --> 00:46:44,609
You're under ship's arrest.
Take him below.

540
00:46:55,662 --> 00:46:57,721
Hand in your arms.

541
00:47:03,837 --> 00:47:06,397
Hand in your arms.

542
00:47:12,546 --> 00:47:14,878
What's the matter, master-at-arms?

543
00:47:16,283 --> 00:47:18,148
These dogs are out of temper, sir.

544
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,546
- Why?
- I don't know, sir.

545
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,118
What is this about?

546
00:47:31,331 --> 00:47:33,891
You will come to attention
when I address you!

547
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:43,243
May I remind you
that this ship is at war?

548
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:47,904
This is a wartime cruise.
We sail under the Articles of War.

549
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:54,046
Volunteer or impressed man,
veteran, seaman, or recruit...

550
00:47:54,221 --> 00:47:56,781
...you are no longer civilians but sailors.

551
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:00,688
A crew that I shall mold into a weapon.

552
00:48:01,228 --> 00:48:03,890
One lawless act...

553
00:48:04,431 --> 00:48:08,299
...one spurt of rebel temper
from any one of you...

554
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:11,995
...high or low...

555
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:16,108
...I shall pay you out
in coin you know of.

556
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,402
You have only two duties here:

557
00:48:18,579 --> 00:48:22,481
To fight and to obey.

558
00:48:23,150 --> 00:48:26,745
And I will bend
each contumacious spirit...

559
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,879
...each stiff-neck,
prideful soul of you...

560
00:48:31,058 --> 00:48:33,583
...or crush you...

561
00:48:35,929 --> 00:48:37,863
...if I must.

562
00:48:39,132 --> 00:48:42,898
Abide by the Articles of War
and my commands...

563
00:48:43,971 --> 00:48:46,963
...or they will cut you down.

564
00:48:50,277 --> 00:48:53,804
Now choose.

565
00:48:59,219 --> 00:49:02,484
Kincaid, you shouted. Why?

566
00:49:05,826 --> 00:49:08,386
Why did Jenkins fall, sir?

567
00:49:12,132 --> 00:49:17,195
Master-at-arms, that accident, the man
who fell upon the deck from the yardarm...

568
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:21,603
...do you know how this occurred?
- I do not, sir.

569
00:49:22,442 --> 00:49:24,034
You were his messmates.

570
00:49:24,211 --> 00:49:27,840
Does any man here
know how this occurred?

571
00:49:38,025 --> 00:49:39,515
You?

572
00:49:47,534 --> 00:49:48,762
No, sir.

573
00:49:54,408 --> 00:49:57,309
Boy, you left your post. Why?

574
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:02,446
I knew that Jenkins was sick, sir.
I saw him sway.

575
00:50:02,616 --> 00:50:04,516
You knew he was sick?

576
00:50:07,721 --> 00:50:10,713
Mr. Claggart,
did you send a sick man aloft?

577
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:12,786
He said he was.

578
00:50:12,959 --> 00:50:15,189
But when I questioned him,
he changed his mind...

579
00:50:15,362 --> 00:50:17,523
...and went to stand his watch.

580
00:50:19,466 --> 00:50:22,663
But that's not the way it happened,
Mr. Claggart. Don't you remember?

581
00:50:30,077 --> 00:50:32,671
That is the way it happened, sir.

582
00:50:43,657 --> 00:50:45,318
I see.

583
00:50:47,227 --> 00:50:48,922
Hand in your arms.

584
00:50:56,703 --> 00:50:58,864
Take him below.

585
00:51:13,553 --> 00:51:17,683
We therefore commit his body
to the deep...

586
00:51:18,391 --> 00:51:22,054
...to be turned into corruption.

587
00:51:22,229 --> 00:51:25,255
Looking for the resurrection
of the body...

588
00:51:25,432 --> 00:51:28,993
...when the sea shall give up her dead.
- The sea shall give up her dead.

589
00:51:29,803 --> 00:51:32,601
- And the corruptible bodies...
- And the corruptible bodies...

590
00:51:32,773 --> 00:51:35,901
...of those who sleep in him...
...of those who sleep in him...

591
00:51:36,076 --> 00:51:38,203
...shall be changed...
...shall be changed...

592
00:51:38,378 --> 00:51:42,075
...and...
...and made like unto his glorious body...

593
00:51:42,716 --> 00:51:45,048
...according to the mighty working...

594
00:51:45,786 --> 00:51:47,754
...whereby he is able...

595
00:51:49,055 --> 00:51:52,821
...to subdue all things...

596
00:51:54,127 --> 00:51:56,288
...unto himself.

597
00:51:59,566 --> 00:52:02,126
- Amen.
- Amen.

598
00:52:15,882 --> 00:52:19,249
Ship's company, dismiss!

599
00:52:44,344 --> 00:52:46,778
Well, that's the end of Enoch Jenkins.

600
00:52:46,947 --> 00:52:51,611
Over the side he goes
and his mates soon forget him.

601
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:55,517
They'll not forget him so soon,
I'm thinking.

602
00:52:57,557 --> 00:53:01,186
Whatever's happened to Jenkins,
he ain't worried none.

603
00:53:01,361 --> 00:53:04,626
He's got a hundred fathoms
between him...

604
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:07,460
...and the troubles of this life.

605
00:53:08,068 --> 00:53:10,298
I'd rather be buried at sea
than on the shore...

606
00:53:10,470 --> 00:53:12,700
...when I come to die.

607
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,670
Will you stand by the plank, mates...

608
00:53:16,843 --> 00:53:19,710
...so I can shake a friendly hand
before I sink?

609
00:53:30,190 --> 00:53:31,714
Budd...

610
00:53:32,525 --> 00:53:35,221
...Captain Vere wishes to see you.

611
00:53:42,903 --> 00:53:44,632
Come in.

612
00:53:46,439 --> 00:53:48,464
Seaman Budd, sir.

613
00:53:51,511 --> 00:53:54,344
- You sent for me, sir?
- Yes, Budd.

614
00:53:54,514 --> 00:53:58,473
Your divisional officer recommends you
for a post of more responsibility.

615
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:02,281
He thinks you can perform duties
of a higher station, and so do I.

616
00:54:02,455 --> 00:54:06,482
The spirit you showed last night
warrants it.

617
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:11,293
From now on,
you're captain of the foretop.

618
00:54:17,437 --> 00:54:21,066
Yes, that's a real honor
for a man so new aboard.

619
00:54:21,641 --> 00:54:23,734
You can trust me, sir.

620
00:54:23,910 --> 00:54:25,639
I do.

621
00:54:25,979 --> 00:54:28,413
Very well. That's all.

622
00:54:29,616 --> 00:54:31,982
Aye, aye, sir. Thanks.

623
00:54:49,402 --> 00:54:51,199
Captain Vere, sir...

624
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,066
...with your permission.
- Yes?

625
00:54:55,041 --> 00:55:00,377
You must be aware, sir,
that Budd is...

626
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:01,638
Well...

627
00:55:01,815 --> 00:55:04,249
It's unlike you to falter, Mr. Claggart.

628
00:55:05,318 --> 00:55:07,411
He has been aboard such a short time.

629
00:55:07,587 --> 00:55:10,317
Long enough to prove himself to me.

630
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:11,923
He left his station last night.

631
00:55:13,526 --> 00:55:16,757
In a good cause no doubt, master-at-arms.

632
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:21,367
He showed initiative.
The captaincy of the foretop is his reward.

633
00:55:22,969 --> 00:55:25,335
With your permission, sir.

634
00:55:25,505 --> 00:55:28,167
Will there not be some dissatisfaction
among those...

635
00:55:28,341 --> 00:55:30,639
...who've been aboard
much longer than Budd?

636
00:55:30,810 --> 00:55:33,745
Oh, master-at-arms,
I concern myself with these matters.

637
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:36,780
They're really none of your function.

638
00:55:40,353 --> 00:55:46,223
Until such a time as the senior topmen
formally object to Budd for incapacity...

639
00:55:46,393 --> 00:55:49,726
...and for no other reason whatsoever...

640
00:55:49,896 --> 00:55:51,693
...he is captain of the foretop.

641
00:55:51,865 --> 00:55:53,958
Make it so on the bill.

642
00:55:55,869 --> 00:55:58,463
- Captain Vere, sir, with your permission.
- What?

643
00:55:58,638 --> 00:56:01,903
In the matter of Kincaid,
the man who shouted from the mast.

644
00:56:02,175 --> 00:56:06,612
It was a serious breach of ship's discipline
while engaging the enemy.

645
00:56:07,313 --> 00:56:09,577
What punishment do you recommend?

646
00:56:22,062 --> 00:56:23,427
Ten lashes.

647
00:56:24,197 --> 00:56:26,961
It was while engaging the enemy.

648
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:37,670
Ten lashes.

649
00:56:41,848 --> 00:56:45,147
- Mr. Claggart.
- Aye, sir.

650
00:56:49,889 --> 00:56:52,790
Do you consider the sentence just?

651
00:56:55,228 --> 00:56:57,287
May I speak freely, sir?

652
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:01,031
I do not ask questions
in order to get insincere answers.

653
00:57:02,302 --> 00:57:04,930
Ten lashes would seem to me
a mild sentence...

654
00:57:05,105 --> 00:57:07,505
...under peacetime conditions.

655
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:12,103
A hundred would, to my mind,
be appropriate.

656
00:57:13,046 --> 00:57:14,513
A hundred?

657
00:57:14,681 --> 00:57:16,979
We must serve the law, sir...

658
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:20,244
...or give up the right
and privilege of service.

659
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:24,584
It is only within that law that we may
use our discretions according to our rank.

660
00:57:25,325 --> 00:57:29,056
You are so lucid and so intelligent
for the rank you hold, master-at-arms.

661
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:30,685
I thank you, sir.

662
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:33,697
Yes. That's no flattery, Mr. Claggart,
it's a melancholy fact.

663
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:38,799
It's sad to see such qualities of mind
bent to such a sorry purpose.

664
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,864
What's the reason for it?

665
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:46,401
I am what I am, sir...

666
00:57:47,413 --> 00:57:50,814
...and what the world has made me.
- The world?

667
00:57:51,151 --> 00:57:53,984
The world demands
that behind every peacemaker...

668
00:57:54,154 --> 00:57:58,921
...there be the gun,
the gallows, the jail.

669
00:57:59,259 --> 00:58:00,954
Do you think it will always be so?

670
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:05,391
- I have no reason not to, sir.
- You live without hope.

671
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:07,666
I live.

672
00:58:10,136 --> 00:58:12,468
But remember, Mr. Claggart...

673
00:58:12,639 --> 00:58:14,869
...that even the man
who wields the whip...

674
00:58:15,041 --> 00:58:18,704
...cannot defy the code we must obey...

675
00:58:19,045 --> 00:58:20,808
...and not be broken by it.

676
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:25,812
- That'll be all.
- Aye, sir.

677
00:58:26,252 --> 00:58:28,447
With your permission, sir.

678
00:58:29,956 --> 00:58:33,323
Is it still to be 10 lashes?

679
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:38,290
It is.

680
00:58:47,937 --> 00:58:49,495
One...

681
00:58:50,506 --> 00:58:52,030
...two...

682
00:58:52,508 --> 00:58:54,271
...three...

683
00:58:55,111 --> 00:58:57,102
...four...

684
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,713
...five...

685
00:58:58,881 --> 00:59:00,405
...six...

686
00:59:00,817 --> 00:59:02,341
...seven...

687
00:59:02,518 --> 00:59:04,145
...eight...

688
00:59:04,320 --> 00:59:06,288
...nine...

689
00:59:06,456 --> 00:59:08,287
...10.

690
00:59:23,239 --> 00:59:25,833
Release the prisoner.

691
00:59:43,259 --> 00:59:46,194
Dismiss ship's company, please,
Mr. Seymour.

692
00:59:46,362 --> 00:59:49,092
Ship's company, dismiss.

693
01:00:09,652 --> 01:00:12,621
I expect the French will be putting us
to our stations any hour now.

694
01:00:12,789 --> 01:00:14,154
Aye.

695
01:00:19,696 --> 01:00:22,130
In the question of Jenkins...

696
01:00:22,298 --> 01:00:25,529
...Budd was telling the truth.
- I know, sir.

697
01:00:26,869 --> 01:00:28,666
What are you going to do
about Claggart?

698
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:30,396
What can I do but watch and wait?

699
01:00:30,573 --> 01:00:34,168
No court-martial would do more than
strip him of his rank for such misconduct.

700
01:00:34,343 --> 01:00:37,506
And then what? As a rating,
he'd be slaughtered by the other men.

701
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,841
And who would replace him?

702
01:00:40,016 --> 01:00:43,782
Would the French refrain from attacking us
while we settled our petty differences?

703
01:00:43,953 --> 01:00:45,386
No, l...

704
01:00:45,555 --> 01:00:50,492
I must give him his head until some act
puts him squarely counter to the law...

705
01:00:50,660 --> 01:00:52,594
...and then let the law consume him.

706
01:01:01,370 --> 01:01:05,602
What would you do
if you were captain of this ship?

707
01:01:10,413 --> 01:01:12,347
I'm not captain of this ship, sir.

708
01:01:13,382 --> 01:01:16,078
One day you may be, Philip.

709
01:01:17,019 --> 01:01:18,577
And then?

710
01:01:19,989 --> 01:01:21,820
Remember.

711
01:02:14,043 --> 01:02:15,943
Good evening, sir.

712
01:02:18,781 --> 01:02:20,544
Good evening.

713
01:02:20,883 --> 01:02:24,785
Will it be all right if I stay topside a bit
to watch the water?

714
01:02:26,055 --> 01:02:30,788
I suppose the handsome sailor may do
many things forbidden to his messmates.

715
01:02:36,732 --> 01:02:39,292
The sea's calm by night, isn't it?

716
01:02:39,468 --> 01:02:41,834
Calm and peaceful.

717
01:02:43,339 --> 01:02:46,604
You've made a good impression
on the captain, Billy Budd.

718
01:02:46,776 --> 01:02:48,937
You have a pleasant way with you.

719
01:02:50,146 --> 01:02:51,875
Thank you, sir.

720
01:02:52,048 --> 01:02:55,347
If you wish to make a good impression
on me too, however...

721
01:02:55,518 --> 01:02:59,284
...you will need to curb your tongue.
- Now, sir?

722
01:02:59,956 --> 01:03:01,890
Not now.

723
01:03:02,925 --> 01:03:06,588
Can it be that you really don't
understand my words?

724
01:03:07,163 --> 01:03:10,860
Is it ignorance or irony...

725
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,930
...that makes you speak so simply?

726
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:18,598
It must be ignorance, sir...

727
01:03:18,774 --> 01:03:21,470
...because I don't understand
the other word.

728
01:03:22,078 --> 01:03:23,739
Let us see which it is.

729
01:03:24,647 --> 01:03:28,139
Tell me, without fear, if you can...

730
01:03:28,584 --> 01:03:30,484
...what do you think of me?

731
01:03:35,091 --> 01:03:37,218
I never met a man like you before.

732
01:03:38,060 --> 01:03:40,324
You blame me for Jenkins' death.

733
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:44,393
You must have had a reason
for doing what you did.

734
01:03:44,567 --> 01:03:46,364
If you thought I had a reason...

735
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:49,360
...why did you contradict my words
before the captain?

736
01:03:52,008 --> 01:03:54,977
In my ignorance, sir,
I could not guess the reason.

737
01:03:55,144 --> 01:03:57,442
I only knew the truth and told it.

738
01:03:59,882 --> 01:04:02,817
The sea is calm, you said...

739
01:04:02,985 --> 01:04:04,782
...peaceful.

740
01:04:06,722 --> 01:04:08,747
Calm above...

741
01:04:09,759 --> 01:04:13,490
...but below,
a world of gliding monsters...

742
01:04:13,663 --> 01:04:16,325
...preying on their fellows.

743
01:04:16,499 --> 01:04:18,626
Murderers, all of them.

744
01:04:19,502 --> 01:04:22,869
Only the strongest teeth survive.

745
01:04:24,307 --> 01:04:27,538
And who's to tell me it's any different
here onboard, or yonder...

746
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:29,974
...on dry land?

747
01:04:31,847 --> 01:04:34,247
You knew my reputation...

748
01:04:34,417 --> 01:04:37,614
...and yet you dared to speak
what you call the truth. Why?

749
01:04:39,689 --> 01:04:43,455
I know some of the men
are fearful of you, hate you...

750
01:04:43,626 --> 01:04:47,619
...but I told them,
you can't be as they think you are.

751
01:04:48,431 --> 01:04:50,126
Why not, pray?

752
01:04:51,867 --> 01:04:54,301
No man can take pleasure in cruelty.

753
01:04:55,071 --> 01:04:56,698
No?

754
01:04:57,306 --> 01:04:59,706
Tell me, do you fear the lash?

755
01:05:02,445 --> 01:05:03,912
Aye.

756
01:05:05,514 --> 01:05:07,812
And will you speak the truth again?

757
01:05:08,818 --> 01:05:11,685
I'm on my honor, sir,
if the captain asks.

758
01:05:20,062 --> 01:05:22,257
Why are you laughing, boy?

759
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,490
Laughter's good, sir.

760
01:05:25,701 --> 01:05:28,829
And it's good to hear you laugh.

761
01:05:29,005 --> 01:05:30,734
Laughter's good?

762
01:05:30,906 --> 01:05:33,602
Even the laughter of fools,
aimed at nothing?

763
01:05:33,776 --> 01:05:37,303
No, sir. You didn't laugh at nothing.

764
01:05:38,381 --> 01:05:40,008
What did I laugh at, then?

765
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:43,245
I don't know, sir...

766
01:05:43,419 --> 01:05:46,217
...but I think you were laughing
at yourself.

767
01:05:50,526 --> 01:05:52,494
Why should I laugh at myself?

768
01:05:53,095 --> 01:05:57,031
There's times when all men do,
men as you can call men.

769
01:05:57,199 --> 01:05:59,463
They make mistakes...

770
01:06:00,002 --> 01:06:03,494
...behave like fools.
- They do?

771
01:06:04,340 --> 01:06:08,743
Tell me in all ignorance,
do you dare understand me, then?

772
01:06:11,414 --> 01:06:12,642
I think so, sir.

773
01:06:17,086 --> 01:06:18,747
Why did Jenkins die?

774
01:06:18,921 --> 01:06:22,721
- You did not wish his death.
- No, I did not.

775
01:06:22,892 --> 01:06:24,325
You didn't even hate him.

776
01:06:26,062 --> 01:06:29,896
I think that sometimes
you hate yourself.

777
01:06:35,905 --> 01:06:37,998
I was thinking, sir...

778
01:06:38,908 --> 01:06:41,240
...the nights are lonely.

779
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:43,503
Perhaps I could talk to you
between watches...

780
01:06:43,679 --> 01:06:45,670
...when you've nothing else to do.

781
01:06:49,351 --> 01:06:51,046
Loneliness.

782
01:06:54,390 --> 01:06:56,415
What do you know of loneliness?

783
01:06:58,894 --> 01:07:00,862
Them's alone as want to be.

784
01:07:02,064 --> 01:07:04,089
Nights are long...

785
01:07:05,367 --> 01:07:07,858
...conversation helps pass the time.

786
01:07:09,105 --> 01:07:13,098
Can I talk to you again, then?
It would mean a lot to me.

787
01:07:14,677 --> 01:07:16,872
Perhaps to me too.

788
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,378
Oh, no.

789
01:07:31,627 --> 01:07:34,152
You would charm me too, huh?

790
01:07:37,600 --> 01:07:39,158
Get away.

791
01:07:40,469 --> 01:07:41,959
Sir?

792
01:07:42,805 --> 01:07:44,932
Get away.

793
01:08:06,095 --> 01:08:08,063
Master-at-arms.

794
01:08:09,331 --> 01:08:11,162
Mr. Claggart, sir?

795
01:08:11,934 --> 01:08:16,030
What's the ''Get thee behind me'' for?

796
01:08:17,940 --> 01:08:19,908
Which of us is Satan, then?

797
01:08:20,075 --> 01:08:23,511
Why, I'm not ambitious.

798
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:29,075
Well?

799
01:08:29,251 --> 01:08:31,242
I can't find nothing wrong
with Budd's gear.

800
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:32,978
All stowed perfect.

801
01:08:33,155 --> 01:08:35,521
Well, disarrange it, man.
You've done it before.

802
01:08:35,691 --> 01:08:37,784
I was nearly caught.
Two of his mates woke up.

803
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:39,621
Be more careful.

804
01:08:39,929 --> 01:08:42,625
I want him on report,
now more than ever.

805
01:08:42,798 --> 01:08:45,358
- Do as you wish.
- Well, it's not easy.

806
01:08:46,869 --> 01:08:48,837
How's your gear, Squeak?

807
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:51,598
All stowed perfect?

808
01:08:58,881 --> 01:09:01,907
Moon's in and out tonight.

809
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:05,377
There's a storm somewhere.

810
01:09:05,554 --> 01:09:07,613
Aye, old man.

811
01:09:08,791 --> 01:09:11,487
There's a storm somewhere.

812
01:09:14,763 --> 01:09:16,253
Well...

813
01:09:16,599 --> 01:09:19,796
...I have my watch to do.

814
01:09:40,889 --> 01:09:42,413
Billy.

815
01:09:42,925 --> 01:09:44,392
Billy.

816
01:09:44,927 --> 01:09:47,691
Slip into the lee forechains.
There's something in the wind.

817
01:09:47,863 --> 01:09:50,457
- What you...?
- No, no, no. Don't speak here.

818
01:09:50,633 --> 01:09:52,362
I'll meet you there.

819
01:10:33,876 --> 01:10:35,468
We'll have to talk quickish, Billy.

820
01:10:35,644 --> 01:10:38,010
The dawn'll be on us
before you can say ''mutiny.''

821
01:10:38,180 --> 01:10:41,547
What is it you want? It's cold it is
and against the rules to be up here.

822
01:10:41,717 --> 01:10:44,083
I saw you and Claggart talking.

823
01:10:44,253 --> 01:10:47,984
I don't know what was said, not liking
to listen to other folks' conversations...

824
01:10:48,157 --> 01:10:51,649
...but if it's buttering him up you are,
beware.

825
01:10:51,827 --> 01:10:53,761
I tried that.

826
01:10:53,929 --> 01:10:57,763
I was frightened of him.
Well, that's how I began, see?

827
01:10:57,933 --> 01:11:02,563
I talked to him one night,
and after that, I was his slave.

828
01:11:02,738 --> 01:11:04,638
I amused him, see?

829
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:07,240
Something about me amuses him.

830
01:11:07,409 --> 01:11:09,206
There's nothing I can do about it.

831
01:11:09,378 --> 01:11:13,439
Anyway, I started spying on people
for him and the like.

832
01:11:13,615 --> 01:11:14,843
Only to escape the lash.

833
01:11:15,017 --> 01:11:17,850
Well, a man can't help
being frightened, can he?

834
01:11:18,287 --> 01:11:21,620
I mean, it's human in some of us.

835
01:11:21,857 --> 01:11:26,260
Every time he laughs at me,
I know I'm safe.

836
01:11:26,495 --> 01:11:28,793
Until the next time, that is.

837
01:11:32,368 --> 01:11:35,235
It's only old Dansker
passing away his watch.

838
01:11:35,404 --> 01:11:39,465
Hey. You know when you kept
finding yourself on report?

839
01:11:39,708 --> 01:11:40,936
Well, that was my doing.

840
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:44,045
Yeah, but I was only obeying orders.
His orders, Claggart's.

841
01:11:44,680 --> 01:11:46,739
Claggart's?

842
01:11:49,852 --> 01:11:53,015
- I thought it was you, out of spite.
- Me?

843
01:11:53,188 --> 01:11:55,622
But I got no spite in me.

844
01:11:55,791 --> 01:11:59,522
Now, take tonight. I'm supposed to
get you on report again, see?

845
01:11:59,695 --> 01:12:04,257
I was sent by Claggart
to steal your kit while you was asleep.

846
01:12:04,433 --> 01:12:06,765
Instead, I woke you up.

847
01:12:07,770 --> 01:12:09,897
My conscience
wouldn't permit me to obey...

848
01:12:10,072 --> 01:12:12,199
...whatever the consequences.
I said to myself:

849
01:12:12,374 --> 01:12:15,502
''You can't do this to Billy. Not this.''

850
01:12:18,113 --> 01:12:19,774
I ought to thank you, then,
didn't I?

851
01:12:19,948 --> 01:12:23,509
No. No, no, I'm a human being,
that's all. Same as the next man.

852
01:12:23,685 --> 01:12:25,653
I want no thanks.

853
01:12:26,021 --> 01:12:28,546
I can't help being a coward though.
That's my trouble.

854
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:33,484
I hate Claggart.

855
01:12:33,662 --> 01:12:37,655
That's what he don't realize.
I hate him.

856
01:12:37,833 --> 01:12:40,563
- You hate him?
- Yes, I do.

857
01:12:40,736 --> 01:12:42,101
Don't you?

858
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:43,704
No.

859
01:12:43,872 --> 01:12:45,100
- You don't?
- No.

860
01:12:45,307 --> 01:12:47,241
You must do.

861
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:50,640
Why has the old man stopped singing?

862
01:12:52,181 --> 01:12:54,149
Get away, old man.

863
01:12:54,883 --> 01:12:58,910
Aye, I'll leave you in the dark, Kincaid...

864
01:12:59,087 --> 01:13:01,351
...but think again.

865
01:13:08,864 --> 01:13:10,991
Well, even though
you don't hate him, Billy...

866
01:13:11,166 --> 01:13:13,498
...there's many as does,
and they need your help.

867
01:13:13,669 --> 01:13:16,695
They came to me and they said,
''Do you think Billy'll help us? ''

868
01:13:16,872 --> 01:13:19,705
I said, ''Well, I've never known him
not to help them in need.''

869
01:13:21,143 --> 01:13:23,543
What do you want me to do?

870
01:13:25,647 --> 01:13:27,342
Tomorrow night...

871
01:13:27,516 --> 01:13:30,542
...talk to Claggart as you did tonight,
with his back to the deck.

872
01:13:30,719 --> 01:13:32,277
Now, that's important.

873
01:13:32,454 --> 01:13:35,685
- The lads will do the rest.
- The rest?

874
01:13:37,092 --> 01:13:40,960
That's a lovely knife you got there.

875
01:13:43,198 --> 01:13:44,859
What...?

876
01:13:46,268 --> 01:13:48,862
Damn. I don't know what you mean.

877
01:13:49,037 --> 01:13:50,470
Forget I even talked to you.

878
01:13:50,639 --> 01:13:53,164
- You better go back where you belong.
- Yeah, I'm going.

879
01:13:53,342 --> 01:13:56,106
If you don't start,
I'll toss you back over the rail.

880
01:13:56,278 --> 01:13:58,473
I never said nothing.

881
01:14:17,099 --> 01:14:18,464
- Well?
- Well, what?

882
01:14:18,634 --> 01:14:21,102
I heard you muttering with him
down by the forechains.

883
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:24,296
I tried something new,
something you once suggested.

884
01:14:24,473 --> 01:14:28,307
I told him some of the lads was out
to kill you and tried to get him to join in.

885
01:14:28,477 --> 01:14:30,638
- And?
- He wouldn't do it.

886
01:14:30,812 --> 01:14:32,677
Fool. Blithering idiot.

887
01:14:32,848 --> 01:14:34,975
You didn't tempt him right.
You made mistakes.

888
01:14:35,150 --> 01:14:36,447
- No.
- You were too obvious.

889
01:14:36,618 --> 01:14:38,609
- Weren't you?
- No, I did as you suggested.

890
01:14:38,787 --> 01:14:40,152
I tried to be subtle.

891
01:14:40,322 --> 01:14:42,256
I told him
how much I hated you.

892
01:14:42,424 --> 01:14:44,654
He didn't let forth one hint
that he agreed with you?

893
01:14:44,826 --> 01:14:47,522
No, sir. No, master-at-arms.
Not one word.

894
01:14:47,696 --> 01:14:52,065
Mr. Claggart, we done enough to him.
He's a good lad, sir.

895
01:14:52,234 --> 01:14:54,998
Couldn't it be someone else?
Kincaid, maybe?

896
01:14:55,170 --> 01:14:58,162
So he's softened your heart too, huh?

897
01:14:58,340 --> 01:15:00,865
I'll see your back laid raw
with the flogging whip.

898
01:15:01,043 --> 01:15:03,477
- No. No.
- Quiet.

899
01:15:05,614 --> 01:15:07,172
Yeah.

900
01:15:08,016 --> 01:15:10,348
He hates you, does Billy Budd.

901
01:15:11,086 --> 01:15:13,611
He wants your life
like the rest of them.

902
01:15:13,789 --> 01:15:15,518
You swear it?

903
01:15:15,724 --> 01:15:17,123
I swear it...

904
01:15:17,292 --> 01:15:18,987
...on my oath.

905
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:22,458
I knew it.

906
01:15:31,873 --> 01:15:35,536
Why don't you go to Mr. Seymour...

907
01:15:35,711 --> 01:15:38,043
...or to the captain?

908
01:15:38,513 --> 01:15:40,777
Then I'd be an informer.

909
01:15:41,683 --> 01:15:44,277
No, no, Dansker, I can't.

910
01:15:51,393 --> 01:15:53,224
It's Kincaid.

911
01:15:55,230 --> 01:15:57,698
Leave him be.

912
01:15:58,834 --> 01:16:02,531
- No.
- Leave him be, Billy Budd.

913
01:16:08,010 --> 01:16:11,173
Kincaid.
What are you doing topside?

914
01:16:11,346 --> 01:16:12,813
You're after Mr. Claggart.

915
01:16:12,981 --> 01:16:15,347
- Well?
- It's wrong, Kincaid. He knows.

916
01:16:15,517 --> 01:16:19,146
- He's waiting for you.
- No more than I'm waiting for him.

917
01:16:19,321 --> 01:16:21,482
Get out of my way, lad,
and let me do it.

918
01:16:21,657 --> 01:16:23,887
No, I won't let you hang yourself.

919
01:16:24,059 --> 01:16:26,584
I don't give a fiddler's damn
what happens to me.

920
01:16:27,429 --> 01:16:29,454
Out of my way, lad.

921
01:16:31,166 --> 01:16:32,997
Give me that knife.

922
01:16:33,735 --> 01:16:37,865
Billy, you're a nice boy,
but I'm not playing.

923
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:39,837
This is no game for boys.

924
01:16:40,008 --> 01:16:42,533
Damn me, I won't let you hang yourself.

925
01:16:44,012 --> 01:16:45,604
The moon's under now.

926
01:16:45,781 --> 01:16:48,682
Sweet mother of God,
will you let me go?

927
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:50,647
No.

928
01:17:22,484 --> 01:17:24,384
Oh, my back.

929
01:17:33,662 --> 01:17:35,721
Explain this.

930
01:17:39,367 --> 01:17:41,494
It was nothing, sir.

931
01:17:41,870 --> 01:17:44,236
- An argument.
- An argument?

932
01:17:48,977 --> 01:17:51,172
- Whose knife is this?
- Mine, sir.

933
01:17:51,847 --> 01:17:53,474
Truth, boy.

934
01:17:53,648 --> 01:17:55,138
Truth.

935
01:17:55,450 --> 01:17:58,317
Isn't that the course
by which you steer?

936
01:17:58,487 --> 01:18:00,387
Or am I wrong?

937
01:18:00,756 --> 01:18:03,122
That's not the way it happened.

938
01:18:03,558 --> 01:18:06,686
That's what you told captain
when Jenkins slipped from carelessness.

939
01:18:07,162 --> 01:18:09,653
There are many ways to lie,
Mr. Claggart.

940
01:18:09,831 --> 01:18:12,527
But there is only one way
to tell the truth.

941
01:18:12,734 --> 01:18:14,292
Jenkins was unfit.

942
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:16,765
Unfit?

943
01:18:17,572 --> 01:18:21,702
Well, here's another one that's unfit.
Up man. On your feet.

944
01:18:31,686 --> 01:18:34,883
I've been expecting you, Kincaid.

945
01:18:36,191 --> 01:18:37,488
Why did you try to stop him?

946
01:18:37,659 --> 01:18:39,684
Why should I want you...?

947
01:18:40,629 --> 01:18:42,153
Killed?

948
01:18:43,565 --> 01:18:46,090
''Why should I want you killed? ''

949
01:18:46,268 --> 01:18:48,293
What's the disturbance there?

950
01:18:48,470 --> 01:18:50,665
You there, forward.

951
01:18:51,606 --> 01:18:55,975
- Master-at-arms reports all in order, sir.
- Stand where you are.

952
01:18:57,746 --> 01:19:00,146
Say nothing to this officer.

953
01:19:00,615 --> 01:19:03,743
Come on, up. On your feet.

954
01:19:09,024 --> 01:19:11,288
What's the matter, master-at-arms?

955
01:19:11,459 --> 01:19:13,825
It's an odd hour for stargazing.

956
01:19:13,995 --> 01:19:15,986
A slight matter, sir.

957
01:19:16,164 --> 01:19:20,066
I found these men together here on deck,
contrary to captain's orders.

958
01:19:20,235 --> 01:19:22,897
I was sending them below
when you called out.

959
01:19:23,071 --> 01:19:25,096
Surely there's more to it than that.

960
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:28,942
The story's lame, man. What occurred?

961
01:19:30,412 --> 01:19:32,277
Your knife, master-at-arms?

962
01:19:34,983 --> 01:19:37,577
William Budd's, sir, I believe.

963
01:19:37,752 --> 01:19:39,686
Return it to him.

964
01:19:42,691 --> 01:19:45,888
You reported all in order, master-at-arms.
I'll take your word for it.

965
01:19:46,061 --> 01:19:48,757
Consequently, I do not wish to see
either of their names...

966
01:19:48,930 --> 01:19:52,195
...on ship's report tomorrow.
- Sir...

967
01:19:52,367 --> 01:19:56,463
...I feel that l...
- Either all is in order or it is not.

968
01:19:56,638 --> 01:19:59,038
If it is not,
I wish to know about it now.

969
01:20:03,478 --> 01:20:08,541
There is no reason for these men's names
to be on ship's report, sir.

970
01:20:09,251 --> 01:20:10,684
Good.

971
01:20:11,620 --> 01:20:13,645
Thank you. Good night.

972
01:20:20,295 --> 01:20:22,092
Get below.

973
01:20:22,397 --> 01:20:23,989
Both of you.

974
01:20:39,581 --> 01:20:41,674
Get below.

975
01:20:51,326 --> 01:20:54,523
- More sail please, Mr. Ratcliffe.
- The glass is falling, sir.

976
01:20:54,696 --> 01:20:57,426
Our mission is to join the fleet.
More sail, Mr. Ratcliffe.

977
01:20:57,599 --> 01:20:59,191
- Aye, sir.
- Morning, master-at-arms.

978
01:20:59,367 --> 01:21:01,858
- Battle stations fully manned.
- Carry on.

979
01:21:02,037 --> 01:21:06,235
With your permission, sir, I would
like to speak to you in private.

980
01:21:06,408 --> 01:21:08,569
If this is not a matter
of grave concern...

981
01:21:08,743 --> 01:21:11,837
...l'd rather...
- It is of grave concern, sir.

982
01:21:12,714 --> 01:21:15,512
Set the topgallants!

983
01:21:21,256 --> 01:21:22,883
Very well.

984
01:21:24,292 --> 01:21:28,194
- I'll be in my cabin, Mr. Wyatt.
- Aye, aye, sir.

985
01:21:48,316 --> 01:21:53,117
Well, master-at-arms, be brief
if you will. I'm required on deck.

986
01:21:56,091 --> 01:21:58,423
Last night, when on my rounds...

987
01:21:58,593 --> 01:22:00,925
...discovering Budd's hammock
was unused...

988
01:22:01,129 --> 01:22:06,157
...I combed the ship and found him
in conclave with several growlers.

989
01:22:06,334 --> 01:22:10,998
Men who, like himself, spread unrest
and rebellion among the crew.

990
01:22:11,172 --> 01:22:12,867
- Budd spreads rebellion?
- Aye, sir.

991
01:22:13,041 --> 01:22:16,067
- An accusation, I take it.
- Aye, sir.

992
01:22:17,746 --> 01:22:18,838
Ratcliffe.

993
01:22:19,014 --> 01:22:20,413
- Oh, Captain Hallam.
- Sir.

994
01:22:20,582 --> 01:22:22,982
Would you bring Budd,
the captain of the foretop?

995
01:22:23,151 --> 01:22:25,244
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

996
01:22:28,923 --> 01:22:31,915
They were collected here,
near the lee forechains...

997
01:22:32,093 --> 01:22:36,029
...and when I ordered them below,
young Budd and others threatened me...

998
01:22:36,197 --> 01:22:39,098
...and swore they'd drop me
and officers they hate overboard...

999
01:22:39,267 --> 01:22:40,894
...on some misty night.

1000
01:22:41,069 --> 01:22:44,527
Should you desire substantial proof, sir,
it is not far.

1001
01:22:44,706 --> 01:22:45,968
Weigh what you speak.

1002
01:22:46,141 --> 01:22:50,134
There is the rope and the yardarm
for false witness, in peace as in war.

1003
01:22:50,311 --> 01:22:52,575
- I understand, sir.
- I am glad to hear it.

1004
01:22:57,252 --> 01:22:58,879
- Budd, sir.
- Bring him in.

1005
01:22:59,054 --> 01:23:00,715
Very good, sir.

1006
01:23:04,659 --> 01:23:05,887
Come in, Budd.

1007
01:23:06,061 --> 01:23:08,393
Captain, see that we're not disturbed,
if you will.

1008
01:23:08,563 --> 01:23:10,622
- Very good, sir.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1009
01:23:15,336 --> 01:23:17,304
Tell this man to his face
what you told me.

1010
01:23:17,472 --> 01:23:19,064
Certainly, sir.

1011
01:23:21,609 --> 01:23:25,511
I said this man, this William Budd...

1012
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:29,946
...acting so out of angry resentment against
impressment and against his officers...

1013
01:23:30,118 --> 01:23:34,179
...against this ship,
this service, and the king...

1014
01:23:34,355 --> 01:23:38,291
...heads in the crew a spirit of rebellion
against the officers, the mates and me.

1015
01:23:38,660 --> 01:23:41,458
And urges them
to the outrage of mutiny.

1016
01:23:43,498 --> 01:23:45,966
This very night,
I surprised him in the forechain...

1017
01:23:46,134 --> 01:23:49,934
...and both saw and heard him
conspire with known malingerers...

1018
01:23:50,105 --> 01:23:53,438
...and men who continually growl
about unfair pay...

1019
01:23:53,608 --> 01:23:56,668
...mistreatment, the lack of shore leave,
and similar complaints.

1020
01:23:57,745 --> 01:24:02,808
I have the names of the others involved
in this sinister plot. The man Kincaid...

1021
01:24:02,984 --> 01:24:05,782
...the old sailor
who goes by the name of Dansker...

1022
01:24:05,954 --> 01:24:09,890
...and regrettably,
my own hitherto trusted corporal.

1023
01:24:10,058 --> 01:24:11,787
But there is no doubt in my mind...

1024
01:24:11,960 --> 01:24:14,360
...that Budd is their ringleader.

1025
01:24:15,296 --> 01:24:19,027
I say this man
threatened his officers with murder...

1026
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:23,364
...and was bent tonight in urging
other men to act concertedly in mutiny.

1027
01:24:25,640 --> 01:24:28,006
I have nothing further to say
at this time, sir.

1028
01:24:31,246 --> 01:24:32,873
Speak, Budd.

1029
01:24:37,552 --> 01:24:41,318
- Defend yourself, Budd.
- I'm...

1030
01:24:45,260 --> 01:24:47,660
Take your time.
Take your time, there's no hurry.

1031
01:24:48,029 --> 01:24:49,826
May I add, sir...

1032
01:24:49,998 --> 01:24:53,229
...I am as surprised as you seem to be
at Budd's complicity in this...

1033
01:24:53,401 --> 01:24:55,801
...as I'd hitherto shared
your high opinion of him.

1034
01:24:55,970 --> 01:24:58,734
Give the lad his chance.
You've made your accusation.

1035
01:24:58,907 --> 01:25:00,135
It's up to him to defend himself.

1036
01:25:02,243 --> 01:25:04,473
- With all due respect, sir...
- Mr. Claggart.

1037
01:25:04,646 --> 01:25:07,137
- I don't think he can.

1038
01:25:08,249 --> 01:25:11,082
It's not so much
that he can't find the words...

1039
01:25:11,252 --> 01:25:15,348
...as that there are no words to find.
- Mr. Claggart, I told you...!

1040
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:40,541
Ca... Captain.

1041
01:25:55,897 --> 01:25:57,330
Seymour?

1042
01:25:57,599 --> 01:26:00,193
Go in there until I call you.

1043
01:26:02,036 --> 01:26:04,402
- Captain Hallam.
- Yes, sir?

1044
01:26:04,572 --> 01:26:06,836
Forgive me for imposing
upon you again.

1045
01:26:07,008 --> 01:26:09,203
Do you think you could
call the surgeon to come?

1046
01:26:09,510 --> 01:26:10,738
The surgeon, sir?

1047
01:26:10,912 --> 01:26:13,540
- I do hope, sir, that you are not...
- No, no.

1048
01:26:13,748 --> 01:26:16,308
- Nothing.
- Very good, sir.

1049
01:26:35,870 --> 01:26:38,270
Good morning, sir.
I trust I find you in good health.

1050
01:26:38,439 --> 01:26:40,236
How is it with this man?

1051
01:26:55,757 --> 01:26:57,554
Is it so, then?

1052
01:26:57,959 --> 01:26:59,654
I thought it.

1053
01:27:00,361 --> 01:27:03,626
- Verify it.
- The man is dead, sir.

1054
01:27:04,165 --> 01:27:07,657
- But is that possible? One blow?
- Temple.

1055
01:27:07,835 --> 01:27:10,565
I've known the largest men
to have thin skulls.

1056
01:27:10,738 --> 01:27:13,901
This might have happened at any time
and for any reason.

1057
01:27:18,946 --> 01:27:20,504
Ratcliffe.

1058
01:27:22,917 --> 01:27:24,350
What?

1059
01:27:29,724 --> 01:27:31,988
Why the drumhead court-martial?

1060
01:27:32,160 --> 01:27:33,684
Couldn't the prisoner be guarded?

1061
01:27:33,861 --> 01:27:36,421
The matter referred to the Admiralty
when we reach port?

1062
01:27:36,597 --> 01:27:39,862
When we reach port? We do not
sail to port, we sail into battle...

1063
01:27:40,034 --> 01:27:42,127
...and battle makes a mockery of justice.

1064
01:27:42,303 --> 01:27:45,272
No, we must cling to what
vestiges of order we can.

1065
01:27:45,440 --> 01:27:47,032
- It must be done quickly.
- Quickly?

1066
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:49,199
Since when is justice
compatible with speed?

1067
01:27:49,377 --> 01:27:52,039
You realize that we were spared mutiny
aboard this ship...

1068
01:27:52,213 --> 01:27:55,376
...simply because we were not in port.
But the men know. They know.

1069
01:27:55,550 --> 01:27:57,677
Rumors fly over the empty sea
and with them...

1070
01:27:57,852 --> 01:27:59,683
...the temper of the times we live in.

1071
01:27:59,854 --> 01:28:01,378
And so we are afraid?

1072
01:28:01,556 --> 01:28:03,854
Justice must be not only quick
but also expedient.

1073
01:28:04,025 --> 01:28:05,856
What did you say?

1074
01:28:06,160 --> 01:28:09,493
I apologize, sir, for the manner,
not for the matter.

1075
01:28:09,664 --> 01:28:12,861
Claggart would've hung for false witness
if Billy hadn't killed him.

1076
01:28:13,034 --> 01:28:16,060
Yes, he would have done,
but by fair process of law.

1077
01:28:16,237 --> 01:28:19,502
Budd has prevented that,
and he's turned the law against himself.

1078
01:28:19,674 --> 01:28:23,576
You can't condemn the boy for answering
with his arm for lack of words.

1079
01:28:23,745 --> 01:28:25,940
He was tempted beyond endurance.

1080
01:28:26,114 --> 01:28:29,914
- The motive was clearly justified.
- Aye, but was the act?

1081
01:28:34,055 --> 01:28:37,149
This master-at-arms,
you know him for a liar, a vicious dog.

1082
01:28:37,325 --> 01:28:40,954
A dog's obeyed in office.
Claggart was authority.

1083
01:28:41,796 --> 01:28:44,697
Seymour, a trial there must be.

1084
01:28:44,866 --> 01:28:48,358
And you cannot make the dead
stand trial.

1085
01:28:49,537 --> 01:28:54,440
So the living must stand trial
for a dead man's crimes.

1086
01:28:54,942 --> 01:28:57,968
It's more than any man
can have to answer for, captain...

1087
01:28:58,146 --> 01:29:00,808
...to his God, or even to his king.

1088
01:29:08,222 --> 01:29:09,917
Come in!

1089
01:29:16,130 --> 01:29:18,098
You all know why
you've been summoned here?

1090
01:29:18,266 --> 01:29:20,461
Aye, sir, in a general sort of way.

1091
01:29:20,635 --> 01:29:23,001
- Ratcliffe.
- You took all precautions, gentlemen?

1092
01:29:23,204 --> 01:29:25,764
No man aboard knows
why you are here?

1093
01:29:25,940 --> 01:29:27,237
No, sir.

1094
01:29:27,408 --> 01:29:30,070
Oh, Captain Hallam, the body?

1095
01:29:30,344 --> 01:29:32,574
It still lies
in the compartment below, sir.

1096
01:29:33,514 --> 01:29:36,005
Nobody saw the men
who put it there?

1097
01:29:36,184 --> 01:29:38,550
No, sir, I made sure of that.

1098
01:29:38,719 --> 01:29:40,516
Thank you, captain.

1099
01:29:54,435 --> 01:29:56,835
I've never seen him so disturbed.

1100
01:29:57,572 --> 01:29:59,039
Aye.

1101
01:29:59,907 --> 01:30:01,966
I give him cause.

1102
01:30:11,385 --> 01:30:13,683
Very well, Mr. Seymour.

1103
01:30:15,289 --> 01:30:16,517
You may proceed.

1104
01:30:17,658 --> 01:30:19,250
Gentlemen.

1105
01:30:26,234 --> 01:30:28,964
You are appointed members
of a court-martial...

1106
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:34,100
...convened by Captain Vere
in extraordinary circumstances.

1107
01:30:34,475 --> 01:30:36,602
I am senior member...

1108
01:30:37,545 --> 01:30:40,173
...and I declare these proceedings open.

1109
01:30:41,182 --> 01:30:43,013
As you know...

1110
01:30:43,184 --> 01:30:46,347
...the master-at-arms has been killed
by the foretopman, Budd.

1111
01:30:46,521 --> 01:30:49,547
Whether by accident or by design...

1112
01:30:49,724 --> 01:30:53,285
...and whether the act
shall carry the penalty of death or no...

1113
01:30:53,461 --> 01:30:55,691
...you are to decide.

1114
01:30:56,831 --> 01:30:58,423
- Sentry.
- Sir.

1115
01:30:58,599 --> 01:31:00,658
Bring the prisoner in.

1116
01:31:01,702 --> 01:31:05,536
There is only one witness,
Captain Vere.

1117
01:31:05,940 --> 01:31:10,400
I shall call on him to give his deposition
as soon as the sentry brings in the prisoner.

1118
01:31:17,985 --> 01:31:20,351
- Sentry, stand outside.
- Sir.

1119
01:31:24,058 --> 01:31:26,390
You may sit down, Billy.

1120
01:31:26,694 --> 01:31:28,321
Thank you, sir.

1121
01:31:33,034 --> 01:31:36,060
Captain, will you be good enough
to give us your account.

1122
01:31:40,775 --> 01:31:44,336
I speak to you not as your captain,
but as a witness before this court.

1123
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:47,174
The master-at-arms, early this morning,
detailed to me...

1124
01:31:47,348 --> 01:31:50,249
...an account of mutinous sentiments
expressed by Budd...

1125
01:31:50,418 --> 01:31:54,354
...and spoke of overhearing a specific
conversation last night during mid-watch.

1126
01:31:54,522 --> 01:31:56,513
- Budd a mutineer? That's absurd.
- Lt. Wyatt.

1127
01:31:56,691 --> 01:31:59,956
- He's one of the best liked...
- Lt. Wyatt, do not interrupt the witness.

1128
01:32:00,127 --> 01:32:01,992
And now, sir, with your permission.

1129
01:32:02,697 --> 01:32:04,028
Budd...

1130
01:32:04,198 --> 01:32:08,066
...did you speak with anyone
in the master-at-arms' hearing last night?

1131
01:32:12,506 --> 01:32:15,031
I spoke a little with the Dansker, sir.

1132
01:32:15,209 --> 01:32:17,677
- The sailmaker?
- Sentry.

1133
01:32:20,548 --> 01:32:21,981
Sir.

1134
01:32:22,183 --> 01:32:24,378
Do you know a seaman
referred to as the Dansker?

1135
01:32:24,552 --> 01:32:25,746
Sir.

1136
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:28,889
Go on deck and find him.
Let him know apart he is wanted here.

1137
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:32,548
And arrange it so that none of
the other people notice his withdrawing.

1138
01:32:32,727 --> 01:32:34,627
See you do it tactfully.

1139
01:32:34,795 --> 01:32:37,821
I want no curiosity aroused
among the men.

1140
01:32:37,999 --> 01:32:39,364
Sir.

1141
01:32:44,839 --> 01:32:46,431
Will you go on, sir, please?

1142
01:32:46,641 --> 01:32:48,700
I sent at once for Budd.

1143
01:32:48,876 --> 01:32:51,936
I ordered the master-at-arms
to be present at this interview...

1144
01:32:52,113 --> 01:32:54,445
...and to repeat his accusations
to Budd's face.

1145
01:32:54,949 --> 01:32:59,579
May I ask what was the prisoner's reaction
on being confronted by the master-at-arms?

1146
01:33:00,221 --> 01:33:04,658
I perceived no uneasiness in his demeanor.
I believe he smiled.

1147
01:33:06,927 --> 01:33:08,895
And for the master-at-arms?

1148
01:33:09,063 --> 01:33:13,864
When I told him to make his accusations
to Budd's face, he faced Budd and did so.

1149
01:33:14,035 --> 01:33:15,263
Did Budd reply?

1150
01:33:15,636 --> 01:33:19,766
He tried to,
but could not frame his words.

1151
01:33:20,307 --> 01:33:21,501
And then, sir?

1152
01:33:23,044 --> 01:33:26,275
He answered with a blow.
The accuser fell.

1153
01:33:26,447 --> 01:33:28,642
It was evident at once
the blow was fatal...

1154
01:33:28,816 --> 01:33:31,876
...but I summoned the surgeon
to verify the fact.

1155
01:33:33,421 --> 01:33:34,979
That's all.

1156
01:33:39,060 --> 01:33:42,029
You've heard Captain Vere's account.

1157
01:33:43,030 --> 01:33:47,126
Is it or is it not as he has said?

1158
01:33:47,368 --> 01:33:49,734
Captain Vere speaks the truth.

1159
01:33:49,904 --> 01:33:51,997
It's just as Captain Vere says.

1160
01:33:52,506 --> 01:33:54,565
But it is not as the master-at-arms said.

1161
01:33:54,742 --> 01:33:56,903
I've eaten the king's bread
and I'm true to him.

1162
01:33:57,078 --> 01:34:00,172
- I believe you, boy.
- God knows, l...

1163
01:34:05,553 --> 01:34:07,020
Thank you, sir.

1164
01:34:08,322 --> 01:34:10,017
Was there malice...

1165
01:34:10,191 --> 01:34:12,386
...between you and the master-at-arms?

1166
01:34:14,095 --> 01:34:16,962
I bore no malice
against the master-at-arms.

1167
01:34:17,131 --> 01:34:21,124
I'm sorry that he's dead.
I did not mean to kill him.

1168
01:34:22,336 --> 01:34:25,794
If I'd have found my tongue,
I would not have struck him.

1169
01:34:26,240 --> 01:34:31,769
But he lied foully to my face, and I had...
Well, I had to say something.

1170
01:34:34,281 --> 01:34:38,308
I could only say it with a blow.

1171
01:34:41,288 --> 01:34:42,812
God help me.

1172
01:34:55,736 --> 01:34:58,227
Anybody seen Mr. Claggart about?

1173
01:35:00,074 --> 01:35:02,599
Well, he was not at the inspection.

1174
01:35:03,511 --> 01:35:06,241
You'd better not let him catch you
lying around like this.

1175
01:35:07,047 --> 01:35:09,709
You have been summoned
in secrecy...

1176
01:35:09,884 --> 01:35:12,580
...to appear before this court
as a witness...

1177
01:35:12,753 --> 01:35:14,914
...of which I am senior member.

1178
01:35:15,089 --> 01:35:20,152
I may not, at this time, disclose to you
the nature of the offense being tried.

1179
01:35:20,327 --> 01:35:23,592
However, the offender
is William Budd, foretopman.

1180
01:35:24,031 --> 01:35:27,228
Do you consent to give this court
your testimony...

1181
01:35:27,401 --> 01:35:30,234
...though ignorant of the case at trial,
and further...

1182
01:35:30,404 --> 01:35:33,737
...to keep in strictest confidence
all that passes here?

1183
01:35:35,342 --> 01:35:36,639
Aye.

1184
01:35:37,211 --> 01:35:39,179
Do you so swear?

1185
01:35:42,683 --> 01:35:44,241
I do.

1186
01:35:45,319 --> 01:35:47,310
Then this is my question:

1187
01:35:48,222 --> 01:35:49,746
In your opinion...

1188
01:35:49,924 --> 01:35:52,757
...is there malice
between the master-at-arms and Budd?

1189
01:35:53,127 --> 01:35:54,151
Aye.

1190
01:35:55,696 --> 01:35:57,561
Explain your statement.

1191
01:35:59,433 --> 01:36:02,368
Master-at-arms bore malice...

1192
01:36:02,536 --> 01:36:04,902
...towards a grace...

1193
01:36:05,406 --> 01:36:07,567
...he could not have.

1194
01:36:08,175 --> 01:36:10,166
There was no reason for it...

1195
01:36:11,312 --> 01:36:13,906
...that ordinary men could understand.

1196
01:36:15,182 --> 01:36:18,811
Pride was his demon.

1197
01:36:19,220 --> 01:36:22,951
And he kept it strong
by others' fear of him.

1198
01:36:25,726 --> 01:36:30,026
He was a Pharisee among the lepers.

1199
01:36:30,431 --> 01:36:33,628
Billy could not understand
such a nature.

1200
01:36:33,801 --> 01:36:38,135
He saw only a lonely man, strange...

1201
01:36:38,305 --> 01:36:40,330
...but a man still.

1202
01:36:40,507 --> 01:36:42,998
Nothing to be feared.

1203
01:36:43,744 --> 01:36:45,735
So Claggart...

1204
01:36:45,913 --> 01:36:49,747
...lest his world be proven false...

1205
01:36:50,784 --> 01:36:52,718
...planned Billy's death.

1206
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:57,557
I notice in your testimony
you've been using the past tense.

1207
01:36:57,725 --> 01:36:59,192
Why?

1208
01:37:01,896 --> 01:37:04,057
I look around...

1209
01:37:05,299 --> 01:37:08,496
...and sense finality here.

1210
01:37:11,872 --> 01:37:14,670
- Have you any more questions?
- One thing more.

1211
01:37:15,209 --> 01:37:19,475
Ever since this master-at-arms
came aboard...

1212
01:37:19,847 --> 01:37:22,407
...from God knows where...

1213
01:37:23,050 --> 01:37:27,680
...I have seen his shadow
lengthen along the deck.

1214
01:37:28,923 --> 01:37:31,084
And being under it...

1215
01:37:31,258 --> 01:37:33,351
...I was afraid.

1216
01:37:35,195 --> 01:37:37,663
Whatever happened here...

1217
01:37:39,266 --> 01:37:42,258
...I am in part to blame.

1218
01:37:49,777 --> 01:37:52,610
Have you any further questions
to put to the accused?

1219
01:37:52,780 --> 01:37:55,112
- None.
- No.

1220
01:37:55,282 --> 01:37:56,977
William Budd...

1221
01:37:57,618 --> 01:38:00,485
...if you have anything further
to say for yourself...

1222
01:38:00,654 --> 01:38:02,417
...say it now.

1223
01:38:10,731 --> 01:38:12,562
I've said all, sir.

1224
01:38:14,001 --> 01:38:15,628
Sentry.

1225
01:38:19,206 --> 01:38:22,232
- Sir.
- Remove the prisoner to my compartment.

1226
01:38:38,325 --> 01:38:40,520
Have you anything to say, Ratcliffe?

1227
01:38:41,061 --> 01:38:42,585
Yes, sir.

1228
01:38:42,930 --> 01:38:46,491
Claggart was killed
because Budd couldn't speak.

1229
01:38:46,667 --> 01:38:49,465
In that sense, that he stammers,
he's a cripple.

1230
01:38:49,636 --> 01:38:53,402
You don't hang a man for that,
for speaking the only way he could.

1231
01:38:55,609 --> 01:38:57,304
If you condemn him, it's the same...

1232
01:38:57,478 --> 01:39:00,709
...as condoning the lie
the master-at-arms clearly told.

1233
01:39:01,348 --> 01:39:03,543
I'd have struck him myself.

1234
01:39:04,551 --> 01:39:06,985
The boy is clearly innocent,
struck in self-defense.

1235
01:39:07,154 --> 01:39:12,057
- Aye. I'm ready to acquit him now.
- Good, then we can reach a verdict at once.

1236
01:39:15,562 --> 01:39:16,824
One moment, gentlemen.

1237
01:39:17,331 --> 01:39:20,494
With your pardon, sir,
as senior member of this court...

1238
01:39:20,667 --> 01:39:23,932
...I must ask if you speak now
as our commanding officer...

1239
01:39:24,104 --> 01:39:25,503
...or as a private individual.

1240
01:39:25,672 --> 01:39:28,835
As convening authority, Seymour,
I summoned this court.

1241
01:39:29,009 --> 01:39:32,001
I must review its findings and approve them
before passing them to the Admiralty.

1242
01:39:32,179 --> 01:39:34,272
- Aye, sir, that is your right.
- No right.

1243
01:39:34,448 --> 01:39:38,214
Which one of us here has rights?
It's my duty, and I must perform it.

1244
01:39:38,385 --> 01:39:41,843
Budd killed a man, his superior officer.

1245
01:39:42,022 --> 01:39:43,250
We've found a verdict, sir.

1246
01:39:43,424 --> 01:39:47,690
I know you have, and your verdict
sets him free, and so would I wish to do.

1247
01:39:47,861 --> 01:39:52,321
But are we free to choose
as we would if we were private citizens?

1248
01:39:52,499 --> 01:39:54,524
The Admiralty has its code.

1249
01:39:54,701 --> 01:39:57,829
Do you think it cares who Budd is?
Who you and I are?

1250
01:39:58,172 --> 01:40:04,133
We don't forget that, sir, but surely even
within that code, each crime is different.

1251
01:40:04,311 --> 01:40:06,040
We can't ignore the facts.

1252
01:40:06,213 --> 01:40:09,808
The facts. Come, you know the facts,
which are the Mutiny Act's provisions.

1253
01:40:09,983 --> 01:40:12,042
At sea, in time of war,
an impressed man...

1254
01:40:12,219 --> 01:40:14,687
...strikes his superior officer
and the blow is fatal.

1255
01:40:14,855 --> 01:40:16,447
Now, according to the Act...

1256
01:40:16,623 --> 01:40:19,524
...the mere fact of the blow
would be enough to hang him...

1257
01:40:19,693 --> 01:40:21,786
...be it fatal or no.

1258
01:40:22,062 --> 01:40:25,122
Now, the men know this
as well as you and I.

1259
01:40:25,632 --> 01:40:27,930
They know the penalty
for Budd's action.

1260
01:40:28,635 --> 01:40:30,569
But they know Budd, sir.

1261
01:40:30,737 --> 01:40:32,932
Claggart too, I dare say.

1262
01:40:33,107 --> 01:40:36,076
As well as any dry letter of the law.

1263
01:40:36,477 --> 01:40:38,638
They would applaud
the decision that frees Budd.

1264
01:40:38,812 --> 01:40:41,610
They'd thank us for it.
Fight the better when the time comes.

1265
01:40:41,782 --> 01:40:44,342
String him to a yard,
they'll turn round and rescue him.

1266
01:40:44,518 --> 01:40:46,918
- And string us up instead.
- Aye, that's the point.

1267
01:40:47,087 --> 01:40:49,681
It's twice as dangerous to hang the boy
as to let him go.

1268
01:40:49,857 --> 01:40:51,381
Yes, that's possible, Ratcliffe.

1269
01:40:51,825 --> 01:40:56,159
Whatever step we take,
the risk is great, but it is ours.

1270
01:40:56,330 --> 01:40:58,457
That is what makes us officers.

1271
01:40:58,632 --> 01:41:02,659
If by our lawful rigor mutiny comes,
there is no blame for us.

1272
01:41:02,836 --> 01:41:06,397
But if in fear,
miscalled a kind of mercy...

1273
01:41:06,573 --> 01:41:10,737
...we pardon Budd against specific order
and then the men revolt...

1274
01:41:10,911 --> 01:41:14,472
...how culpable and weak
our verdict will appear.

1275
01:41:17,117 --> 01:41:21,850
I can see that, sir.
But this case is exceptional.

1276
01:41:22,022 --> 01:41:24,991
And pity, if we are men,
must move us, captain.

1277
01:41:25,159 --> 01:41:27,024
So am I moved, Ratcliffe.

1278
01:41:27,194 --> 01:41:31,460
But we cannot have warm hearts
betraying heads which should be cool.

1279
01:41:32,132 --> 01:41:34,794
Officers are only men in uniform.

1280
01:41:34,968 --> 01:41:39,428
We have our standards,
ethics, scruples.

1281
01:41:39,606 --> 01:41:41,733
Challenge your scruples.

1282
01:41:42,276 --> 01:41:44,801
Come, do they mean something like this?

1283
01:41:45,345 --> 01:41:48,872
Can we adjudge to summary
and shameful death...

1284
01:41:49,049 --> 01:41:52,541
...a fellow creature
we believe to be innocent before God?

1285
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:55,779
- Does that state your case rightly?
- That is my feeling, sir.

1286
01:41:55,956 --> 01:41:59,323
- Acquit him, then you say, as innocent.
- Yes.

1287
01:41:59,493 --> 01:42:02,519
Oh, I know the Articles prescribe death
for what Budd has done...

1288
01:42:02,696 --> 01:42:06,894
Stow the Articles. They don't account
for such a case as this.

1289
01:42:07,801 --> 01:42:11,965
You've said yourself, sir,
Budd is innocent.

1290
01:42:12,139 --> 01:42:16,235
In a court more merciful than a martial one,
our views might count.

1291
01:42:16,410 --> 01:42:20,403
- They might even set him free.
- Sir, when Claggart told you his lies...

1292
01:42:20,581 --> 01:42:23,175
...the case immediately went beyond
military justice.

1293
01:42:23,617 --> 01:42:26,677
There, Seymour, you reveal
the whole weakness of your argument.

1294
01:42:26,853 --> 01:42:29,981
Here, nothing is beyond the scope
of military justice.

1295
01:42:30,157 --> 01:42:33,183
When we first put this on,
we resigned our freedom.

1296
01:42:33,360 --> 01:42:36,727
The gold we wear
shows that we serve the king...

1297
01:42:36,897 --> 01:42:38,558
...the law.

1298
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:42,863
For the term of my active life,
I am bound by an oath I took...

1299
01:42:43,036 --> 01:42:46,096
...when I was half the age
of any of you here.

1300
01:42:46,273 --> 01:42:49,936
And now, for the first time in my life,
I feel the weight of those words...

1301
01:42:50,110 --> 01:42:54,547
...I spoke so solemnly as a midshipman,
ignorant of their meaning...

1302
01:42:54,715 --> 01:42:58,344
...with nothing but dreams of glory
in my mind.

1303
01:42:58,585 --> 01:43:00,177
Yes, but...

1304
01:43:00,554 --> 01:43:03,785
...gentlemen, you took that oath as well.

1305
01:43:07,327 --> 01:43:09,261
There's no escape.

1306
01:43:11,398 --> 01:43:15,596
All I know is that I can't sit by
and see an innocent man hanged.

1307
01:43:15,769 --> 01:43:19,569
- Who'd gain by Budd's death? Admiralty?
- You want to make us murderers.

1308
01:43:19,740 --> 01:43:23,141
What is this ship you serve in?
An ark of peace? Go count her guns...

1309
01:43:23,310 --> 01:43:26,074
...then tell your conscience to lie quiet,
if you can.

1310
01:43:26,246 --> 01:43:29,374
But that is war.
This will be downright killing.

1311
01:43:29,549 --> 01:43:33,110
It's all war, Ratcliffe.
War to the death for all of us.

1312
01:43:35,355 --> 01:43:37,619
Oh, you see that, Seymour?

1313
01:43:38,091 --> 01:43:40,719
That this war...

1314
01:43:40,894 --> 01:43:43,294
...began before our time?

1315
01:43:45,032 --> 01:43:48,126
- And will end long after it.
- Aye...

1316
01:43:49,503 --> 01:43:52,700
...if ever men deserve to be at peace.

1317
01:43:56,610 --> 01:43:58,305
Couldn't we...

1318
01:43:58,478 --> 01:44:01,606
...mitigate the penalty
if we find him guilty?

1319
01:44:01,782 --> 01:44:04,751
No, Ratcliffe,
the penalty is prescribed.

1320
01:44:08,922 --> 01:44:13,586
I'd like to think about it, captain.

1321
01:44:15,962 --> 01:44:17,896
I'm not sure.

1322
01:44:19,333 --> 01:44:21,494
The French are not far off.

1323
01:44:22,202 --> 01:44:25,000
Soon the men will know what happened.

1324
01:44:25,539 --> 01:44:30,670
Our consciences are private matters,
Ratcliffe, but we are public men.

1325
01:44:31,845 --> 01:44:37,078
Dare we give our consciences precedence
over the code that made us officers?

1326
01:44:37,250 --> 01:44:40,845
And which called this case to trial?

1327
01:44:41,855 --> 01:44:43,618
Dare we?

1328
01:44:52,632 --> 01:44:54,259
No, sir.

1329
01:45:00,540 --> 01:45:03,475
Can you stand Budd's murder
on your conscience?

1330
01:45:03,643 --> 01:45:05,611
Wyatt, hold your tongue.

1331
01:45:12,185 --> 01:45:14,585
- I say let him go.
- Sit down, sir.

1332
01:45:14,755 --> 01:45:16,882
I won't bear a hand
to hang an innocent man.

1333
01:45:17,057 --> 01:45:19,389
My blood's not cold enough for that.

1334
01:45:21,027 --> 01:45:24,758
I cannot give the kind of judgment
that you wish to force upon us.

1335
01:45:26,299 --> 01:45:28,995
I beg to be excused
from sitting upon this court-martial.

1336
01:45:29,236 --> 01:45:30,828
Wyatt...

1337
01:45:31,705 --> 01:45:35,163
...we do not deal with justice here,
but with the law.

1338
01:45:38,645 --> 01:45:42,240
Was not the one conceived
to serve the other?

1339
01:45:42,716 --> 01:45:46,345
Wyatt, can't you see that you must
first strip off the uniform you wear...

1340
01:45:46,520 --> 01:45:50,581
...and then your flesh before you can
escape the case at issue here?

1341
01:45:50,924 --> 01:45:53,392
Decide you must, Wyatt...

1342
01:45:53,827 --> 01:45:56,625
...or else reason with us.

1343
01:45:57,364 --> 01:46:01,767
Show us how to save the boy
without setting aside our function.

1344
01:46:02,369 --> 01:46:05,099
You think Seymour, Ratcliffe and I
wouldn't save the boy...

1345
01:46:05,272 --> 01:46:08,105
...if we could find a way
consistent with our duty?

1346
01:46:08,742 --> 01:46:11,040
Well, perhaps you can do this.

1347
01:46:12,179 --> 01:46:13,908
Can you do this?

1348
01:46:15,315 --> 01:46:16,942
Speak, man.

1349
01:46:17,217 --> 01:46:18,684
Speak.

1350
01:46:20,187 --> 01:46:22,155
Show us how.

1351
01:46:25,225 --> 01:46:29,423
Save him, Wyatt, and you save us all.

1352
01:47:02,195 --> 01:47:06,256
Do not think me pitiless
in thus demanding sentence...

1353
01:47:06,566 --> 01:47:08,761
...on a luckless boy.

1354
01:47:11,538 --> 01:47:13,768
I feel as you do for him.

1355
01:47:15,475 --> 01:47:17,375
And for myself...

1356
01:47:17,677 --> 01:47:19,474
...revulsion...

1357
01:47:20,146 --> 01:47:21,807
...shame...

1358
01:47:23,717 --> 01:47:25,617
...and rage.

1359
01:47:31,424 --> 01:47:33,221
Is there hope for me, captain?

1360
01:47:36,696 --> 01:47:38,129
Billy...

1361
01:47:38,865 --> 01:47:43,564
...what hope is there for any of us?

1362
01:47:53,847 --> 01:47:55,576
Tell me why.

1363
01:47:55,749 --> 01:47:58,479
I only want to understand.

1364
01:48:02,122 --> 01:48:04,750
A child, with his endless ''whys.''

1365
01:48:04,925 --> 01:48:06,222
''Why are there wars?

1366
01:48:06,393 --> 01:48:08,918
Why must men kill each other? ''
A child will ask...

1367
01:48:09,095 --> 01:48:13,191
...and the parent will grow impatient
believing these questions to be foolish.

1368
01:48:13,633 --> 01:48:15,533
They're not foolish,
they're questions...

1369
01:48:15,702 --> 01:48:19,604
...to which grown men
have lost the answer.

1370
01:48:21,041 --> 01:48:23,134
The answer went with innocence.

1371
01:48:23,310 --> 01:48:24,800
Why?

1372
01:48:26,046 --> 01:48:28,537
I cannot tell you why.

1373
01:48:31,251 --> 01:48:34,482
I feel sorry, captain, but not guilty.

1374
01:48:34,654 --> 01:48:39,023
Nor should you. Claggart killed you
the moment you killed him.

1375
01:48:39,192 --> 01:48:41,217
But I'm still alive.

1376
01:48:42,128 --> 01:48:47,430
You, in your goodness,
are as inhuman...

1377
01:48:47,601 --> 01:48:50,229
...as was Claggart in his evil.

1378
01:48:51,338 --> 01:48:54,671
Well, at least be human now, Billy.
Give in to anger for once.

1379
01:48:54,841 --> 01:48:56,900
Hate me for what I do to you. No...

1380
01:48:57,077 --> 01:48:58,772
Please, Billy.

1381
01:48:59,179 --> 01:49:02,546
Promise me your fury and resentment.

1382
01:49:04,818 --> 01:49:06,581
Hatred will make you
conquer your fear.

1383
01:49:07,120 --> 01:49:09,088
I'm not afraid, sir.

1384
01:49:09,589 --> 01:49:11,853
I did my duty. You're doing yours.

1385
01:49:15,862 --> 01:49:17,295
Sentry.

1386
01:49:18,231 --> 01:49:20,665
Take Budd into your charge.

1387
01:49:42,822 --> 01:49:44,380
Merryweather.

1388
01:49:56,536 --> 01:49:58,561
Time to get up, Budd.

1389
01:50:21,761 --> 01:50:25,128
Marine detachment. Attention!

1390
01:50:30,336 --> 01:50:34,067
- Marine detachment present and correct, sir.
- Thank you.

1391
01:50:45,919 --> 01:50:49,821
Over there. Mr. Seymour.

1392
01:51:01,334 --> 01:51:04,565
Ship's company, form ranks!

1393
01:51:05,138 --> 01:51:07,265
Come on, move up there.

1394
01:51:07,741 --> 01:51:12,144
Attention! Division commander's report.

1395
01:51:12,479 --> 01:51:14,845
Afterguard present or accounted for, sir.

1396
01:51:15,014 --> 01:51:18,177
Starboard battery
present or accounted for, sir.

1397
01:51:18,351 --> 01:51:20,581
Larboard battery
present and accounted for, sir.

1398
01:51:20,754 --> 01:51:24,212
Fore-, main-, and mizzentopmen,
five working party...

1399
01:51:24,390 --> 01:51:25,914
...one absentee, sir.

1400
01:51:26,693 --> 01:51:29,161
One absentee.

1401
01:51:29,696 --> 01:51:32,563
All hands will stand by
to witness punishment.

1402
01:51:32,732 --> 01:51:34,063
Stand easy.

1403
01:51:35,368 --> 01:51:37,302
Who could they be punishing?

1404
01:51:37,971 --> 01:51:39,802
And what for?

1405
01:51:39,973 --> 01:51:42,635
It's got to be a flogging.
I ought to know.

1406
01:51:42,809 --> 01:51:44,902
But why have they kept us
off the catwalks?

1407
01:51:45,345 --> 01:51:48,314
They flog men at noon.

1408
01:51:48,515 --> 01:51:50,642
The early morning...

1409
01:51:51,284 --> 01:51:53,582
...is for a hanging.

1410
01:51:54,154 --> 01:51:55,985
- Hanging?
- Hanging.

1411
01:51:56,156 --> 01:51:57,748
Hanging?

1412
01:52:03,329 --> 01:52:06,730
Where's Ferguson? Where's Billy?

1413
01:52:06,900 --> 01:52:08,868
And Turner.

1414
01:52:09,035 --> 01:52:11,230
Aye, Morrison too.

1415
01:52:12,272 --> 01:52:15,332
There were four hammocks
empty last night.

1416
01:52:15,809 --> 01:52:19,768
- That will be the working party.
- But there's five in the working party.

1417
01:52:19,946 --> 01:52:21,937
One absentee.

1418
01:52:24,951 --> 01:52:26,816
Hey...

1419
01:52:26,986 --> 01:52:30,513
...where's Claggart?
- Well, you don't suppose it's him, do you?

1420
01:52:30,690 --> 01:52:33,386
- Oh, Judas, let it be that fish-blooded...
- Not him.

1421
01:52:33,560 --> 01:52:37,257
He's too smart, he is.
Where's Squeak, come to that?

1422
01:52:37,430 --> 01:52:40,695
Well, he'll be with Claggart.
Why isn't Claggart here?

1423
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:42,727
He is here.

1424
01:52:43,169 --> 01:52:45,535
Where? I don't see him.

1425
01:52:46,339 --> 01:52:48,136
He is here.

1426
01:52:50,443 --> 01:52:52,206
You're barmy, old man.

1427
01:53:19,706 --> 01:53:23,198
Ship's company, attention!

1428
01:53:24,377 --> 01:53:27,676
Marine detachment, attention!

1429
01:53:29,782 --> 01:53:32,979
Ship's company
present to witness execution, sir.

1430
01:53:33,152 --> 01:53:34,642
Very well.

1431
01:53:36,689 --> 01:53:39,783
Ship's company
ready to witness execution, sir.

1432
01:53:41,527 --> 01:53:42,653
Captain Hallam.

1433
01:53:43,796 --> 01:53:47,698
Escort, bring forward the prisoner.

1434
01:54:08,254 --> 01:54:09,414
- Billy!
- Billy.

1435
01:54:09,589 --> 01:54:11,648
- They can't, Bill.
- They've got old Billy.

1436
01:54:11,824 --> 01:54:13,382
No talking in the ranks.

1437
01:54:13,559 --> 01:54:16,084
- They'll pay for this.
- Steady, mate. Steady.

1438
01:54:16,262 --> 01:54:17,854
Form up.

1439
01:54:19,198 --> 01:54:21,029
Do you hear me? Silence in ranks.

1440
01:54:26,506 --> 01:54:28,133
Escort.

1441
01:55:19,425 --> 01:55:21,188
I'm sorry, Billy.

1442
01:55:22,562 --> 01:55:24,689
Come on, keep moving.

1443
01:55:25,765 --> 01:55:27,892
Keep silent there.

1444
01:55:44,317 --> 01:55:47,844
Proceedings of the court-martial
held aboard HMS Avenger...

1445
01:55:48,021 --> 01:55:52,014
...on the 28th August, 1797...

1446
01:55:52,191 --> 01:55:53,852
...convened under the authority...

1447
01:55:54,027 --> 01:55:57,463
...of Edwin Fairfax Vere,
post captain, royal navy...

1448
01:55:57,630 --> 01:56:01,498
...and composed of the first, second
and third lieutenants of said vessel.

1449
01:56:02,201 --> 01:56:06,297
The case of William Budd,
foretopman, royal navy.

1450
01:56:06,706 --> 01:56:09,698
While attached and so serving
the aforesaid vessel...

1451
01:56:09,876 --> 01:56:14,245
...he did, on the 28th day
of August, 1797...

1452
01:56:14,414 --> 01:56:17,212
...strike and kill his superior officer...

1453
01:56:17,383 --> 01:56:20,875
...one John Claggart, master-at-arms...
- Did you, Billy?

1454
01:56:22,555 --> 01:56:24,182
Quiet!

1455
01:56:25,258 --> 01:56:26,816
Silence, you men! Form up!

1456
01:56:26,993 --> 01:56:30,087
Stand to attention there, hang you!
Silence in the ranks!

1457
01:56:30,263 --> 01:56:34,199
You will be silent and remain
at strict attention until dismissed!

1458
01:56:40,873 --> 01:56:43,068
- Master-at-arms, royal navy.

1459
01:56:43,843 --> 01:56:46,243
Therefore, the court sentences
the aforementioned...

1460
01:56:46,412 --> 01:56:48,744
...William Budd, foretopman,
royal navy...

1461
01:56:48,915 --> 01:56:52,214
...to die by hanging on the first watch
following these proceedings.

1462
01:56:52,385 --> 01:56:54,012
Don't worry, Billy.

1463
01:56:54,187 --> 01:56:55,518
Do you hear, sir?

1464
01:56:59,225 --> 01:57:02,353
By authority of His gracious
Majesty George Rex...

1465
01:57:03,129 --> 01:57:07,031
...and Alan Napier, Viscount Kelsey,
First Sea Lord.

1466
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,895
Signed...

1467
01:57:10,403 --> 01:57:13,497
...Philip Seymour, senior member.

1468
01:57:20,413 --> 01:57:23,246
Let them dance on a rope's end!

1469
01:57:23,416 --> 01:57:25,850
You're not hanging Billy Budd!

1470
01:57:26,052 --> 01:57:27,542
Silence!

1471
01:57:27,720 --> 01:57:30,450
You will resume discipline instantly!
Be warned!

1472
01:57:30,623 --> 01:57:33,786
For the last time, you scum,
will you obey orders?

1473
01:57:33,960 --> 01:57:36,326
Stand back into ranks.

1474
01:57:48,107 --> 01:57:50,632
Resume your ranks there
and be quick about it!

1475
01:58:35,521 --> 01:58:36,954
Prisoner...

1476
01:58:37,623 --> 01:58:39,682
...have you anything to say?

1477
01:58:48,668 --> 01:58:52,468
If you have nothing to say,
the sentence of the court will be carried out.

1478
01:59:09,555 --> 01:59:11,113
God bless Captain Vere.

1479
01:59:14,760 --> 01:59:16,557
Sound off!

1480
01:59:16,729 --> 01:59:18,822
Marines, cover the hanging party!

1481
01:59:18,998 --> 01:59:20,295
No, Billy!

1482
01:59:50,930 --> 01:59:53,364
Permission to dismiss the men, sir.

1483
01:59:55,001 --> 01:59:57,595
Permission to dismiss the men, sir.

1484
02:00:00,706 --> 02:00:02,264
Sir?

1485
02:00:02,808 --> 02:00:07,268
You may do as you wish, Mr. Seymour.
It's of no further concern to me.

1486
02:00:07,446 --> 02:00:09,914
Sir, a decision must be made.

1487
02:00:10,082 --> 02:00:13,779
A decision has been made,
Mr. Ratcliffe.

1488
02:00:15,388 --> 02:00:20,553
I'm only a man,
not fit to do the work of God...

1489
02:00:21,227 --> 02:00:22,956
...or the devil.

1490
02:00:31,971 --> 02:00:33,438
Ship's company.

1491
02:00:33,606 --> 02:00:38,043
Ship's company, by divisions, dismiss!

1492
02:00:38,244 --> 02:00:40,508
Afterguard dismissed.

1493
02:00:40,680 --> 02:00:42,841
Starboard battery dismissed.

1494
02:00:43,015 --> 02:00:45,245
Larboard battery dismissed.

1495
02:00:45,451 --> 02:00:49,353
Fore-, main-, and mizzentopmen dismissed.

1496
02:00:56,529 --> 02:00:57,826
Repeat the order!

1497
02:01:15,848 --> 02:01:18,681
Captain Hallam, fire into their ranks.

1498
02:01:19,151 --> 02:01:21,676
Marines, take aim.

1499
02:01:29,161 --> 02:01:30,492
Beat to quarters!

1500
02:01:30,663 --> 02:01:32,961
Clear decks for action!

1501
02:01:47,947 --> 02:01:51,439
Come on, lads, let's punish the French
for turning up late!

1502
02:02:31,557 --> 02:02:34,253
The rest belongs to naval history.

1503
02:02:34,427 --> 02:02:36,918
But if the sacrifice of Billy Budd...

1504
02:02:37,096 --> 02:02:40,930
...has served to make men
more conscious of justice...

1505
02:02:41,100 --> 02:02:44,399
...then he will not have died in vain.

1506
02:02:44,637 --> 02:02:47,470
Men are perishable things...

1507
02:02:47,640 --> 02:02:51,599
...but justice will live
as long as the human soul...

1508
02:02:52,344 --> 02:02:55,836
...and the law,
as long as the human mind.
