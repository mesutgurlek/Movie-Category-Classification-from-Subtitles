1
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,649
Halt! Where are you going?

2
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,207
Go on! Move along!

3
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,201
No!

4
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,091
Belorussians!

5
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,088
Each of you has a mission

6
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:16,080
to assist in the reconstruction
of your region.

7
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,851
You must be aware

8
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:22,728
that this cannot be accomplished
without support from the Germans.

9
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,970
Any resistance to German orders

10
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,283
will be considered sabotage,

11
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,563
in the same way as
incitement to riot.

12
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,963
There are still individuals

13
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,369
who do not understand
the path to follow.

14
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,642
These partisans

15
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,891
who attacked the German Wehrmacht

16
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,886
shall be justly punished.

17
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,605
Look at what happens
to enemies of the German Reich.

18
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,601
Do not support the partisans.

19
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:55,928
Their situation is hopeless.

20
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,609
All those who rally with the partisans

21
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,087
will meet the same fate.

22
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,245
Now is the time for grand solutions.

23
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,047
Take an active part

24
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:13,087
in the reconstruction
of the Belorussian state

25
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
for the Belorussian people.

26
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,321
Hang them!

27
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,604
IN THE FOG

28
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,371
from the novel by Vassil BYKOV

29
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,851
Come on!

30
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,287
Damn!

31
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,245
Don't just stay there!

32
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:59,283
Move on. It's not very deep.

33
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,684
The last thing I need!

34
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,446
What a pain!

35
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,006
See it?

36
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,446
Over there.

37
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,566
I see it.

38
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,570
We'll wait.

39
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,403
We'll go at nightfall.

40
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,804
You think he expects us?

41
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,245
Probably not.

42
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,723
Maybe he ran off already.

43
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,523
To join the German police.

44
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,405
Wait here.

45
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,285
Anything wrong,

46
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,451
I'll shoot.

47
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,730
Don't be long.

48
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,923
I won't be. Not long.

49
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,081
Nice little paws...

50
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:42,489
We need to give her eyes,
then some ears.

51
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,242
Pointed ears, like a fox.

52
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,205
What do we call her?

53
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,841
Belka.

54
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:53,521
We'll make her little ears
very pointy.

55
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,930
Hello.

56
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,047
Look at the horse that my daddy made.

57
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,290
It's a nice horse.

58
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,370
He also made me this doggy with a tail.

59
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,810
With a tail?

60
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:44,686
That's nice.
What's your name?

61
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:47,087
Grisha. My father is Sushenya.

62
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:50,880
So you're Grigorij Sushenya.

63
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,010
How's life?

64
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:59,648
Sit down, don't stand.

65
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,884
I didn't recognize you.

66
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,806
You've changed.

67
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,207
You seem different, too.

68
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,246
My friend plays with a bullet.

69
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:28,967
Really?

70
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,362
That's not for children to play with.

71
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,328
It's not a real cartridge,
only the casing.

72
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,124
The casing...

73
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,080
I've really come for you, Sushenya.

74
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:11,284
Where's your wife?

75
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,650
Milking the cow.

76
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,442
I heated up bathwater.

77
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,290
We were going to wash up.

78
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,091
To wash...

79
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,564
That's nice.

80
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,770
I knew you would come.

81
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,441
You did?

82
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,685
That's good.

83
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,888
You recognize your guilt.

84
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,569
There's nothing to recognize.

85
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:54,969
I am guilty of nothing.

86
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,530
That's the thing.

87
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:00,447
Nothing?

88
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,521
Nothing.

89
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,610
And those men?

90
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,329
The ones that were hanged?

91
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,531
They were hanged.

92
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,566
Hello.

93
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,771
Hello...

94
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:34,601
Anelya.

95
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,165
Well...

96
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,889
I'll prepare some food.

97
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,649
You must be hungry.

98
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,684
There's no time, Anelya.

99
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:11,524
Do you have cloth wraps
for my feet?

100
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,211
Mine need replacing.

101
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,642
Your mother, is she still alive?

102
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,565
She died.

103
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:54,651
Six months ago.

104
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,924
And your sister Nyura?

105
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,725
She's dead, too.

106
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:07,489
Killed last spring
in Lisichansky forest.

107
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,162
Let's have a drink.

108
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,441
No.

109
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:13,805
I don't want to.

110
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:16,486
What a pity.

111
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,765
I will.

112
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:21,491
May I?

113
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,566
Go on.

114
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,245
But make it quick.

115
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:51,728
This is not what people do.

116
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,764
And it's just not true.

117
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,204
It's not true!

118
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,164
What's not true?

119
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:13,447
We didn't wish this. We didn't want it!

120
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:19,165
I was so afraid when they arrested him.

121
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,045
I couldn't sleep.
I cried my eyes out.

122
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,129
Then they released him.

123
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:27,243
And what were we to do then?

124
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,408
He didn't ask for any of this!

125
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,806
He didn't do anything wrong to them.
He tried to protect them!

126
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,762
But they were hanged.

127
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,130
And he was freed.

128
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,081
Why?

129
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,249
Who knows why!

130
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,081
No.

131
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,001
There's a reason.

132
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,804
Go on, Anelya.

133
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,489
There's nothing to discuss.

134
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,406
It's fate.

135
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,648
Come on, let's go.

136
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,569
Where are you taking him?

137
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,367
I must go. Not for long.

138
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:35,369
Don't cry. Calm down.

139
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,160
We have...

140
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,208
something to take care of.

141
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,807
- He'll be back soon.
- That's right.

142
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:47,250
Fine but it's still...

143
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:49,681
Why not take something with you?

144
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,009
At least take some lard.

145
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,243
You need something to eat.

146
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,128
Don't leave without food.

147
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,087
- Let me give you an onion.
- No, it's okay.

148
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,481
You like onion with lard.

149
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:18,211
Go ahead and take it, if you like it.

150
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,162
Fine, give me one.

151
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,764
Everything tastes better with onion.

152
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,130
Especially lard.

153
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,123
It will be good with a drink.

154
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,927
In case I'm late, wash up without me.

155
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,447
Which way?

156
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,161
Over there.

157
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,563
Should I take a shovel?

158
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,081
Yes.

159
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:35,762
Go on.

160
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,370
You know what happens.

161
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,442
If you betray...

162
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:42,926
I betrayed no one!

163
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:45,043
- Then who did it?
- I don't know.

164
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,689
You were freed, right?

165
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,803
Yes, those bastards.

166
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,921
I wish they would have hanged me.

167
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,122
Move along!

168
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,645
How could you, brothers?

169
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,928
This river floods in springtime.

170
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,690
It's like a swamp.

171
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:28,529
What were you expecting? Sand?

172
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,370
Well, not this.

173
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,168
Sand would be better.

174
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:38,809
You might face this someday, too.

175
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,690
Sand?

176
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:50,766
Fine.

177
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,651
Let's move on.

178
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:56,081
There's sand amongst the pines.

179
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,369
There's higher ground up ahead.

180
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,805
Go on, move!

181
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,326
Stop.

182
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:45,486
So?

183
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,083
As good a place as any, right?
For any occasion.

184
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:50,645
Occasion?

185
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,888
If you had told me...

186
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:56,130
Anything can happen in this kind of war.

187
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:58,288
- This is savagery!
- Shut up!

188
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,209
Voitik, stand guard over there
while we take care of this.

189
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,561
Go.

190
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:50,369
It would be better
not to tell Anelya about this.

191
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:56,044
About what?

192
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,890
That you shot me.

193
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,328
Tell her the Germans killed me.

194
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,204
Of course, later,

195
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,964
she'll find out.

196
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,684
Keep digging...

197
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:13,844
We'll see.

198
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,646
Maybe that's enough.

199
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,802
It will take too long to fill it back up.

200
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:21,728
Do it, as a favor to me.

201
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,731
This coat...

202
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,961
You must give it to Anelya.

203
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,166
Your coat?

204
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:39,326
Fine.

205
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,603
I'll take care of it.

206
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,684
It's a good coat.

207
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,607
She's not likely
to find one like it.

208
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,166
A widow...

209
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:25,291
Voitik, is that you?

210
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,766
Don't move!

211
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,767
Halt!

212
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:48,966
Missed!

213
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,645
Stop, bastard!

214
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,285
Take him from the right!

215
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,805
Are you alive?

216
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,764
Where are you wounded?

217
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:29,481
What? What do you want?

218
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:35,561
Where...

219
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,327
Where are you taking me?

220
00:33:42,280 --> 00:33:43,964
I don't know.

221
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,211
Voitik...

222
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,125
I'm not Voitik. I'm Sushenya.

223
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,250
L...

224
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:09,530
am...

225
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,403
hurt badly?

226
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,364
Who knows.

227
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,729
But you were shot.

228
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,882
And I didn't

229
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,365
kill you in time.

230
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,050
No time.

231
00:34:32,160 --> 00:34:35,482
The police appeared suddenly
out of nowhere.

232
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,961
Take me to Zubrovka.

233
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,681
I must go to Zubrovka.

234
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,925
Over there,

235
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,330
look for Kienya.

236
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,800
Kienya? Fine.

237
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,201
Bu rov?

238
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,450
Comrade Voitik?

239
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,764
What happened to Burov?

240
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,761
Well...

241
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,811
they shot him.

242
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:03,208
This is what you get!

243
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,201
Into the barn!

244
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,649
What were you doing?

245
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:31,800
Nothing.

246
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,410
What are you plotting?

247
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:40,886
Nothing!

248
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,964
What are you plotting?

249
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,449
I didn't build this truck
with my own hands

250
00:41:57,640 --> 00:41:59,802
so that those bastards could drive it!

251
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,331
Don't be foolish!

252
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,244
Haven't I had enough grief?

253
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,249
- Haven't I had enough?
- Go to sleep, Mother.

254
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,170
I know you're plotting.

255
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:25,728
You want justice!

256
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,931
I've suffered enough.

257
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,770
I'm sleeping.

258
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,171
You sleep?

259
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:38,123
I know how you sleep.

260
00:42:43,760 --> 00:42:48,084
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
deliver us from evil.

261
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:52,724
O Lord, Jesus Christ, deliver us
from evil and forgive us, our sins.

262
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,810
Lord have mercy. Lord have mercy.

263
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,364
Save and protect us. "

264
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:39,483
Aunt Anisya, is Kolya home?

265
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:46,324
- Is Kolya home?
- Don't shout. I'm not deaf.

266
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,724
You're dressed fancy!

267
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,165
Hello, Kolya.

268
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,480
What do you want?

269
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:18,963
Mikitionok sent me.

270
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:20,851
We need your help.

271
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,844
We can't manage
with that troublesome truck.

272
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:28,010
It won't start.
But you can get it running.

273
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,962
Come and give us a hand.

274
00:44:34,240 --> 00:44:37,323
Mirokha, I once knocked
one of your teeth out.

275
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:39,047
And?

276
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:42,289
Looking at you now,
I should have knocked them all out.

277
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:47,285
You fool!

278
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:49,880
So?

279
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,286
Are you coming?

280
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,410
Get the hell out!

281
00:44:57,880 --> 00:44:59,530
That's how you want it?

282
00:45:00,520 --> 00:45:02,363
I could order you to do it.

283
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,370
You're asking for it.

284
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,689
Come closer and I'll spit in your face.

285
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:11,042
I've had it with you! Get out!

286
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,164
I'll get you one day! Count on it!

287
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,128
He's upset
because they took his truck.

288
00:45:17,320 --> 00:45:20,130
I'll have your backs
to the wall someday!

289
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:22,928
You'll regret this, Kolya!

290
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,289
You were a fool before
and you're still a fool today.

291
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,001
Say I went to my aunt's.

292
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,600
Where are you going?

293
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:01,489
I'll hide out until this mess settles.

294
00:51:17,800 --> 00:51:19,529
You shouldn't have done it.

295
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:08,525
Idiot...

296
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,725
I sent you to stand guard.

297
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:16,965
And you...

298
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:19,930
I did stand guard.

299
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,085
But they sneaked in from the other side.

300
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:28,205
The other side...

301
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:33,927
You're so sly.

302
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:35,765
Oh, yeah.

303
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:37,450
Sly. yourself!

304
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:40,007
Why did we go into the pines?

305
00:52:45,680 --> 00:52:48,650
You really don't understand anything.

306
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:54,289
Where is Sushenya?

307
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:58,806
Sitting over there.

308
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,129
Don't harm him.

309
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:06,686
As you want.

310
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:08,685
What do I care?

311
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:15,767
What will the Commander say?

312
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:55,809
What do we do now?

313
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:58,123
Just sit here?

314
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,364
Wait to be shot like rabbits?

315
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,250
From where?

316
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:29,651
Babichi?

317
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,970
Probably.

318
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,448
There's no way I'll make it.

319
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,724
You can't carry me.

320
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,210
We need a cart.

321
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:39,084
If not, then he's...

322
00:56:48,520 --> 00:56:50,488
Where are they shooting?

323
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,769
Who knows.

324
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:56,969
Over there.

325
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:00,925
Babichi?

326
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,770
Probably.

327
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:09,610
Stay here.

328
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,490
We'll go and find a cart.

329
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:18,128
Hurry and do your best.

330
00:57:23,760 --> 00:57:25,285
Sushenya...

331
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:28,448
You know your way around here.

332
00:57:29,400 --> 00:57:31,448
You know where a village is?

333
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,048
Babichi is over there.

334
00:57:39,360 --> 00:57:40,771
Near the virgin woods.

335
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:44,081
- Near the gunfire?
- Yes.

336
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,048
Go and find a cart.

337
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,046
Wait.

338
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:11,760
I'll go.

339
00:58:28,200 --> 00:58:30,009
You stay here.

340
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:33,730
Stand guard.

341
00:58:34,920 --> 00:58:36,922
Give me my gun.

342
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:40,201
Your gun?

343
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,324
Here.

344
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:57,888
I'll try to be quick,

345
00:58:58,920 --> 00:59:00,649
if it's not far.

346
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:52,242
Why didn't I...

347
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,887
kill you at the house?

348
00:59:58,240 --> 01:00:00,322
If I had done it

349
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:03,690
there,

350
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:06,842
I wouldn't be dying now.

351
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,323
In my own home?

352
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:15,644
My boy was there.

353
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,605
The boy...

354
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:23,966
Yes...

355
01:00:32,600 --> 01:00:34,523
And why...

356
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,127
haven't you escaped, Sushenya?

357
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:42,201
Escape to where?

358
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:46,929
To the Germans?

359
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,802
I've been with the Germans.

360
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,126
Here.

361
01:00:59,200 --> 01:01:00,440
Look.

362
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,250
It was you...

363
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:25,004
You betrayed them,

364
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,164
those three men.

365
01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:32,004
I betrayed no one.

366
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,004
Then why...

367
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:42,168
didn't they hang you

368
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,561
with the others?

369
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:49,043
If they had hanged me,

370
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:51,728
I would be grateful.

371
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:54,691
But no...

372
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:57,564
they freed me.

373
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:01,727
I thought they'd come back for me.

374
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:04,125
But no.

375
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:08,922
I sat at home for two weeks.

376
01:02:09,120 --> 01:02:11,088
Where should I have gone?

377
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:14,770
Then little by little,

378
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:18,451
I began to understand
why they freed me.

379
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:22,648
They used me as bait.

380
01:02:24,040 --> 01:02:26,042
You fell into their trap.

381
01:02:31,400 --> 01:02:34,244
I was a rail road worker
for 13 years.

382
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:37,008
Surely you know that already.

383
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,041
I almost quit when the Germans arrived.

384
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,408
But the station master came by.

385
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,967
You must know Tereshkov.

386
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,927
He told us to go to work

387
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,241
or the Germans would kill him.

388
01:02:57,960 --> 01:02:59,724
What could I do?

389
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:02,801
I went.

390
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:51,764
What a bastard!

391
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:54,361
He was a bastard under the Soviets, too.

392
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,321
His kind adapts to any regime.

393
01:04:57,800 --> 01:05:00,371
If ever I cross him in a dark alley...

394
01:05:01,040 --> 01:05:02,246
Bastard!

395
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:08,765
Give him a punch during inspection.

396
01:05:09,560 --> 01:05:10,891
Surprise him!

397
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:14,929
That's it! And I'll say it was your idea.

398
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,646
I won't be alone before the firing squad.

399
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:21,120
That's it. Don't say a word.

400
01:05:21,760 --> 01:05:24,366
Keep your mouth shut and take it.

401
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:27,608
Until the right moment comes.

402
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:31,925
The right moment?

403
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:35,402
Well...

404
01:05:36,080 --> 01:05:39,209
We can loosen ajoint
and send everything flying.

405
01:05:39,480 --> 01:05:41,528
We can do it on a curve.

406
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:44,530
Who is responsible for maintenance?
That bastard.

407
01:05:44,720 --> 01:05:46,882
The Germans would execute him.

408
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,444
A joint, you said?

409
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:54,050
Good idea!

410
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:02,251
The Germans are not stupid.

411
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:04,404
They would figure it out.

412
01:06:04,600 --> 01:06:07,809
They would discover
that the joint had been sabotaged.

413
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:09,161
Not at all!

414
01:06:09,360 --> 01:06:13,206
When a train goes off the tracks,
not one joint will resist.

415
01:06:13,400 --> 01:06:15,084
Everything is destroyed.

416
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,007
Remember last month?

417
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,441
Not far from the Lemeshev post,

418
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:23,570
there was an accident or some sabotage.

419
01:06:23,960 --> 01:06:27,282
A total mess. Impossible to detect.

420
01:06:27,480 --> 01:06:30,609
If anyone, the partisans
would be suspected.

421
01:06:31,560 --> 01:06:33,085
Nothing to do with us.

422
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,883
We just do our job.

423
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:38,845
We go back, put away our tools,

424
01:06:39,040 --> 01:06:40,644
and then go home.

425
01:06:40,840 --> 01:06:42,569
Why suspect us?

426
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:44,808
And the nearby village?

427
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:48,323
If partisans are suspected,
they'll raze the village.

428
01:06:48,840 --> 01:06:52,526
They'll shoot everyone.
All those innocents.

429
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,443
It has happened many times.

430
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,449
Which village?

431
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,563
Only a few old women there.

432
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:01,728
And are they not human beings?

433
01:07:02,560 --> 01:07:04,289
You must not do this.

434
01:07:05,840 --> 01:07:07,569
So you're afraid?

435
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:11,364
The train runs at night.
We won't even be there.

436
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,768
Or maybe he likes

437
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:16,324
being punched around.

438
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:21,170
Will you help us?

439
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,370
You must not do this.

440
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,323
You want to call the Germans?

441
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,564
Let's speak like friends,
with open hearts.

442
01:11:56,840 --> 01:11:59,127
You seem like a reasonable person.

443
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:05,121
Yes.

444
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:08,042
And we want to help you.

445
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:11,001
Tomorrow, we will hang the others.

446
01:12:11,200 --> 01:12:14,090
But we are offering you life.

447
01:12:15,880 --> 01:12:17,086
Except...

448
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:21,646
Yes?

449
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:24,604
You will live.

450
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:28,201
Except...

451
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,850
You must sign a collaboration agreement.

452
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:38,443
What collaboration?

453
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,125
A secret collaboration, of course.

454
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:50,201
With the German authorities.

455
01:12:52,760 --> 01:12:54,842
Then we'll organize your release.

456
01:12:55,560 --> 01:12:57,642
You will return to your people,

457
01:12:58,120 --> 01:13:01,090
the ones who dispatched you
on this mission.

458
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,761
We will stay in close contact.

459
01:13:06,640 --> 01:13:09,883
Secretly, of course.

460
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,645
No.

461
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,450
You know...

462
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,610
I can't.

463
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,170
I can't do that.

464
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:32,086
What?

465
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:35,605
What did you say?

466
01:13:38,000 --> 01:13:39,604
I can't do that.

467
01:13:41,200 --> 01:13:42,964
Are you an idiot?

468
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,368
You're refusing to live?

469
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:52,004
You want to die?

470
01:13:55,280 --> 01:13:57,009
Of course not, but...

471
01:13:58,040 --> 01:13:59,804
Then sign the agreement.

472
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:03,288
We will take every precaution.

473
01:14:03,480 --> 01:14:05,642
No one will suspect a thing.

474
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:12,045
I can't do it.

475
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,840
So...

476
01:14:18,520 --> 01:14:20,249
you want to die.

477
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:28,528
The hanging is tomorrow.

478
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:32,364
Give it some thought.

479
01:14:34,560 --> 01:14:35,971
You have until tomorrow.

480
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:03,524
Move it!

481
01:15:07,200 --> 01:15:08,281
Let's go...

482
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:15,529
Not Sushenya.

483
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:18,726
Why not?

484
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,001
Get up.

485
01:15:58,280 --> 01:16:00,760
Did you think about my proposal?

486
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:18,087
You still want to dangle from a rope
with your friends?

487
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:25,567
I mistook you for a clever fellow.

488
01:16:26,560 --> 01:16:28,085
But you're an idiot.

489
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,047
You want a noble death?

490
01:16:32,640 --> 01:16:34,802
Want everyone to honor your memory?

491
01:16:35,240 --> 01:16:37,561
Want them to write pamphlets about you?

492
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:40,921
No...

493
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:44,364
That's not going to happen.

494
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:49,090
I will arrange another sort
of death for you.

495
01:16:52,440 --> 01:16:54,488
For the last time:

496
01:16:55,800 --> 01:16:56,801
<i>Yes</i>

497
01:16:57,520 --> 01:16:59,010
or no?

498
01:17:07,880 --> 01:17:09,211
I can't do it.

499
01:17:11,080 --> 01:17:12,206
Fine.

500
01:17:14,800 --> 01:17:16,450
You can't.

501
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:21,728
Get out of here.

502
01:17:26,320 --> 01:17:27,560
Go away.

503
01:17:45,880 --> 01:17:46,961
Go.

504
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,043
What could I do?

505
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:47,968
I envied them immediately.

506
01:20:50,160 --> 01:20:52,083
Everyone honored them.

507
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:55,968
Their children were proud.

508
01:20:57,720 --> 01:21:01,520
Neighbors helped their families.
But I was hated.

509
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,650
I sensed

510
01:21:07,160 --> 01:21:09,845
that even the person who loved me most,

511
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:12,810
my wife Anelya,

512
01:21:14,200 --> 01:21:16,567
no longer looked at me

513
01:21:17,760 --> 01:21:19,205
like before.

514
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:25,447
One day, she burst into tears and said:

515
01:21:27,480 --> 01:21:29,960
Hanging you would have been better!

516
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:35,729
I started to wonder

517
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,527
if I might even hang myself.

518
01:21:41,400 --> 01:21:43,243
But even that...

519
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,211
People would say: "His guilty conscience.

520
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,768
He was a traitor.

521
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,642
How could I live like that, Kolya?

522
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,361
Kolya...

523
01:22:03,640 --> 01:22:04,971
Do you hear me?

524
01:22:05,960 --> 01:22:07,041
Kolyag

525
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:09,366
Don't forget to ask about the tobacco!

526
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:12,004
He promised.

527
01:29:12,200 --> 01:29:13,804
I won't forget.

528
01:31:11,080 --> 01:31:12,525
How is he?

529
01:31:13,640 --> 01:31:16,405
He's resting. He has very high fever.

530
01:31:30,760 --> 01:31:33,047
The guys asked about tobacco.

531
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:34,927
Halt!

532
01:34:45,080 --> 01:34:46,320
Come here!

533
01:35:12,520 --> 01:35:13,760
Where are you going?

534
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,046
Where are you from?

535
01:35:45,480 --> 01:35:46,845
Where did you get this?

536
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:52,085
I don't know.
I stopped by some guy's house.

537
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:54,089
He gave it to me.

538
01:35:57,360 --> 01:35:58,725
Where?

539
01:36:00,600 --> 01:36:01,761
I don't know.

540
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:12,681
Take us there.

541
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:35,761
Damn!

542
01:39:01,640 --> 01:39:03,085
You still here?

543
01:39:04,760 --> 01:39:06,000
But him...

544
01:39:08,240 --> 01:39:10,083
I knew it.

545
01:39:12,200 --> 01:39:13,611
When?

546
01:39:13,800 --> 01:39:15,564
Yesterday afternoon.

547
01:39:16,360 --> 01:39:17,725
Well...

548
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:21,923
No need for a cart.

549
01:39:27,720 --> 01:39:30,803
They're all there, waiting.

550
01:39:33,160 --> 01:39:35,242
Since yesterday.

551
01:39:37,880 --> 01:39:39,166
So?

552
01:39:40,080 --> 01:39:41,605
There's no cart?

553
01:39:42,840 --> 01:39:44,604
No cart.

554
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,123
The Germans are in Babichi.

555
01:39:47,800 --> 01:39:49,131
The Germans?

556
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,970
So what now?

557
01:39:53,040 --> 01:39:54,849
What now?

558
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:57,088
We hide the body and leave.

559
01:39:57,840 --> 01:39:59,729
We might get through.

560
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:01,280
To go where?

561
01:40:02,480 --> 01:40:04,005
Each goes his own way.

562
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:06,450
I'll go to my platoon.

563
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:10,240
You'll probably go back to the Germans.

564
01:40:11,360 --> 01:40:13,089
I'm not going to the Germans.

565
01:40:14,080 --> 01:40:16,082
Take me with you.

566
01:40:17,240 --> 01:40:18,810
To my platoon?

567
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,243
Yeah, they're waiting for you.

568
01:40:37,440 --> 01:40:39,124
We must take Burov.

569
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:42,282
We can't just leave him here.

570
01:40:42,840 --> 01:40:44,922
Did you see all those crows?

571
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:51,322
But you carry him.

572
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:54,969
Yes, I will.

573
01:40:55,480 --> 01:40:56,845
Understood.

574
01:41:01,280 --> 01:41:03,089
Then get up.

575
01:41:50,120 --> 01:41:51,724
You know where to go?

576
01:41:53,960 --> 01:41:56,008
If we want to avoid Babichi,

577
01:41:56,200 --> 01:41:58,248
then we must head left.

578
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:02,485
Lead the way.

579
01:42:03,840 --> 01:42:05,649
Be careful!

580
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:07,770
Steer clear of Germans.

581
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:51,005
Where's that coming from?

582
01:43:54,320 --> 01:43:55,970
The main road, I think.

583
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:58,850
The main road?

584
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:00,201
Yes.

585
01:44:01,680 --> 01:44:03,364
Where are you taking us?

586
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:06,324
Where else can I go?

587
01:44:07,080 --> 01:44:09,731
You said the Germans are in Babichi.

588
01:44:11,080 --> 01:44:12,491
They are.

589
01:44:15,120 --> 01:44:17,361
Then this is the only option.

590
01:44:17,560 --> 01:44:19,130
We have to cross the main road.

591
01:44:59,640 --> 01:45:01,290
What do we do now?

592
01:45:02,240 --> 01:45:03,685
Do we cross?

593
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:08,129
We should wait
until the darkness of night.

594
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:12,450
That's along wait.

595
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:15,084
But it's better.

596
01:45:32,120 --> 01:45:34,009
You knew each other well?

597
01:45:37,080 --> 01:45:38,650
Since childhood.

598
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:41,448
We lived on the same street.

599
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:44,288
He was younger than me.

600
01:45:44,480 --> 01:45:46,687
He always loved cars.

601
01:45:48,480 --> 01:45:49,811
Yes...

602
01:45:51,320 --> 01:45:53,129
That was his downfall.

603
01:45:54,360 --> 01:45:56,010
And you, with him.

604
01:45:57,600 --> 01:45:59,170
Him, maybe.

605
01:46:00,160 --> 01:46:02,288
Mine was something else.

606
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:04,850
What?

607
01:46:06,120 --> 01:46:08,168
That I didn't die back there,

608
01:46:08,360 --> 01:46:10,761
in the police station. That's what.

609
01:46:13,760 --> 01:46:15,842
Why the hurry to die?

610
01:46:17,480 --> 01:46:21,007
Burov was in a hurry.
He couldn't wait.

611
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:24,002
His foolishness is to blame.

612
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:26,126
Yes...

613
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:29,649
He died too soon.

614
01:46:31,560 --> 01:46:34,530
He was still young. A pity.

615
01:46:36,240 --> 01:46:38,208
What do you care?

616
01:46:41,080 --> 01:46:43,287
It was kind of my fault.

617
01:46:44,280 --> 01:46:46,044
Except not at all.

618
01:46:48,120 --> 01:46:49,804
I didn't Wish it.

619
01:46:51,040 --> 01:46:53,850
I just didn't want to die in that swamp.

620
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:57,930
If you had,
Burov would still be alive.

621
01:46:58,560 --> 01:46:59,971
Isn't that right?

622
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:03,524
Yes, probably.

623
01:47:07,480 --> 01:47:09,767
You'll tell everything to your commander?

624
01:47:11,440 --> 01:47:13,204
Tell what?

625
01:47:14,800 --> 01:47:16,529
Everything about me.

626
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:19,210
If I don't make it.

627
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,763
After all, I have a wife,

628
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:24,560
a son..

629
01:47:25,120 --> 01:47:26,884
Oh, that!

630
01:47:27,840 --> 01:47:29,524
Yes, I'll tell them.

631
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:33,521
I better write it down.

632
01:47:33,840 --> 01:47:35,649
Writing it would be good.

633
01:47:36,640 --> 01:47:38,369
It would be documented.

634
01:47:39,680 --> 01:47:41,808
You rely on documents?

635
01:47:42,680 --> 01:47:43,761
Well, yes.

636
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:47,166
Maybe they'll sort it all out someday.

637
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:56,366
But they did enlist you, didn't they?

638
01:47:56,960 --> 01:47:59,361
Go on, confess.

639
01:48:02,840 --> 01:48:04,569
If Only!

640
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:06,451
But no.

641
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:08,843
They tried.

642
01:48:09,560 --> 01:48:11,164
But I couldn't.

643
01:48:11,880 --> 01:48:13,689
I just couldn't do it.

644
01:48:14,920 --> 01:48:16,729
You really couldn't?

645
01:48:17,640 --> 01:48:19,483
You must be lying!

646
01:48:23,320 --> 01:48:26,085
You know that's impossible.

647
01:48:26,280 --> 01:48:28,169
Not this situation.

648
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:31,042
We cause our own ruin,

649
01:48:32,000 --> 01:48:33,889
but also our family's.

650
01:48:35,080 --> 01:48:36,809
What kind of life would they have?

651
01:48:37,920 --> 01:48:40,890
If they remained alive...

652
01:48:43,920 --> 01:48:46,161
Anything can happen.

653
01:48:48,640 --> 01:48:50,563
This is wartime, of course...

654
01:48:54,560 --> 01:48:56,369
You refer to war,

655
01:48:57,640 --> 01:48:59,483
how anything can happen...

656
01:49:01,000 --> 01:49:03,970
But did everything change
in a year-and-a-half?

657
01:49:05,680 --> 01:49:08,126
Do people really change so quickly?

658
01:49:08,600 --> 01:49:11,809
Does war really transform us
to that extent?

659
01:49:17,200 --> 01:49:19,487
I've lived here for 37 years.

660
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:22,004
Everyone knows me.

661
01:49:22,760 --> 01:49:24,649
I was always respected.

662
01:49:25,480 --> 01:49:27,767
I never had troubles with anyone.

663
01:49:29,480 --> 01:49:31,960
So why not trust me anymore?

664
01:49:33,440 --> 01:49:35,841
Why do we trust the Germans,

665
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:37,849
but no longer our neighbors?

666
01:49:38,840 --> 01:49:40,842
No one believes me. Not you...

667
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:43,850
Not even my wife...

668
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:46,084
She has doubts.

669
01:49:48,000 --> 01:49:49,684
Did I change?

670
01:49:50,640 --> 01:49:53,644
How, if I was born with this character?

671
01:49:57,560 --> 01:49:59,767
People can change a lot.

672
01:50:01,200 --> 01:50:03,521
They are unstable by nature.

673
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:07,247
Especially if they want to survive.

674
01:50:07,840 --> 01:50:09,205
Exactly.

675
01:50:10,000 --> 01:50:13,083
If you want to live,
why choose to betray?

676
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:17,443
In the face of death,
everything looks the same.

677
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:21,004
But when you want to live,

678
01:50:21,560 --> 01:50:23,562
you live with hope.

679
01:50:25,120 --> 01:50:26,690
If not for yourself,

680
01:50:27,720 --> 01:50:29,927
then maybe for your children.

681
01:50:31,600 --> 01:50:32,965
Maybe they

682
01:50:34,040 --> 01:50:35,849
will be lucky to survive.

683
01:50:40,720 --> 01:50:42,563
So, you go first.

684
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:45,361
Wait for me on the other side.

685
01:52:46,160 --> 01:52:47,366
Halt!

686
01:52:48,680 --> 01:52:49,727
Halt!

687
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:08,489
I suddenly saw him.

688
01:53:08,680 --> 01:53:10,523
Damn it to hell!

689
01:53:10,720 --> 01:53:12,404
No way I missed him!

690
01:53:13,760 --> 01:53:16,127
- Where is he?
- Hold on.

691
01:53:19,240 --> 01:53:20,844
There he is.

692
01:53:26,200 --> 01:53:27,645
He has rifles.

693
01:53:28,760 --> 01:53:31,604
- I knew he was a bandit.
- Is he dead?

694
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:35,811
Seems that way.

695
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:38,806
The holster...

696
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:44,650
It's empty.
So where's his pistol?

697
01:53:44,880 --> 01:53:46,325
Search him.

698
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:53,810
Look at those boots.

699
01:54:56,160 --> 01:54:57,650
Hurry UP...

700
01:55:17,560 --> 01:55:18,846
Damn!

701
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:21,010
He's still alive.

702
01:55:22,880 --> 01:55:24,848
Finish him and let's go.

703
02:02:47,320 --> 02:02:50,244
