00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,883
<i>The Red Badge Of Courage was written
by Stephen Crane in 1894.</i>

2
00:01:09,552 --> 00:01:11,417
<i>From the moment it was published...</i>

3
00:01:11,654 --> 00:01:14,452
<i>it was accepted by critics
and public alike...</i>

4
00:01:14,524 --> 00:01:16,549
<i>as a classic story of war.</i>

5
00:01:16,626 --> 00:01:19,060
<i>And of the boys and men who fought war.</i>

6
00:01:19,295 --> 00:01:22,787
<i>Stephen Crane wrote this book
when he was a boy of 22.</i>

7
00:01:23,566 --> 00:01:26,091
<i>Its publication made him a man.</i>

8
00:01:26,836 --> 00:01:29,771
<i>His story is of a boy who, frightened...</i>

9
00:01:29,973 --> 00:01:32,407
<i>went into a battle and came out of it...</i>

10
00:01:32,475 --> 00:01:34,272
<i>a man with courage.</i>

11
00:01:34,344 --> 00:01:37,643
<i>More than that, it is a story
of many frightened boys...</i>

12
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:39,511
<i>who went into a great Civil War...</i>

13
00:01:39,582 --> 00:01:41,914
<i>and came out as a nation...</i>

14
00:01:42,385 --> 00:01:44,979
<i>of united, strong and free men.</i>

15
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:50,891
<i>The narration you will hear spoken
consists of quotes...</i>

16
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,360
<i>from the text of the book itself.</i>

17
00:01:56,232 --> 00:01:59,099
<i>Spring, 1862.</i>

18
00:01:59,435 --> 00:02:01,801
<i>The bloody war between the states.</i>

19
00:02:01,905 --> 00:02:04,237
<i>Tales of great movement shook the land.</i>

20
00:02:04,307 --> 00:02:06,400
<i>Marches, sieges, conflicts.</i>

21
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:09,743
<i>But for the untried army
on the Rappahannock...</i>

22
00:02:09,813 --> 00:02:12,873
<i>war was simply a matter of waiting...</i>

23
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:14,741
<i>waiting...</i>

24
00:02:14,818 --> 00:02:16,809
<i>and endless drilling.</i>

25
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:21,314
Regiment, march!

26
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:34,069
Right, march!

27
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,965
Left, march!

28
00:02:46,549 --> 00:02:47,880
Dismissed!

29
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:50,516
Dismissed!

30
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:55,757
I reckon I'll dig some worms
and go fishing.

31
00:02:55,825 --> 00:02:57,486
Yeah? The fish ain't biting.

32
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,121
But there's nothing else to do.
Now that my tent's got a plank floor...

33
00:03:01,197 --> 00:03:03,825
it's comfortable as home.
I only need a rocking chair.

34
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,027
I just like to sit and rock.

35
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:08,626
How's things?

36
00:03:08,705 --> 00:03:12,573
Just like they was yesterday,
and the day before, and will be tomorrow.

37
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:15,907
I wouldn't be too sure about tomorrow,
if I was you.

38
00:03:15,979 --> 00:03:17,844
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

39
00:03:17,914 --> 00:03:18,710
Nothing.

40
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,875
Sure you mean something.
Come on. Tell me like a good feller.

41
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:24,351
- Can you keep it to yourself?
- Of course I can.

42
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,650
I know a fellow that's got a brother...

43
00:03:26,723 --> 00:03:28,987
who's an orderly
up at división headquarters.

44
00:03:29,058 --> 00:03:31,822
This fellow's brother
saw some orders last night.

45
00:03:31,895 --> 00:03:35,228
The orders said this here army
is going up the river, cut across...

46
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,459
and coming around in behind the Rebs.

47
00:03:37,533 --> 00:03:40,263
- Thunderation!
- Yeah, you just wait.

48
00:03:40,336 --> 00:03:43,328
Tomorrow you're going to see
the biggest battle you ever saw.

49
00:03:43,406 --> 00:03:44,896
You just wait.

50
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,147
Fellers!

51
00:03:58,588 --> 00:03:59,816
Fellers!

52
00:03:59,956 --> 00:04:01,389
The army's going to march.

53
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:04,858
We're going up the river. Cut across,
and come around in behind the Rebs.

54
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:08,887
It's a lie. A thundering lie! I don't believe
this old army is ever going to move.

55
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:11,160
You believe it or not, I don't give a hang.

56
00:04:11,234 --> 00:04:14,965
I believe you. I'll tell you why.
I finished laying a plank floor for my tent.

57
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:17,506
I held off all winter,
because I thought we'd move.

58
00:04:17,573 --> 00:04:19,768
Come spring,
I decided we're here for good.

59
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:23,073
So I started the plank floor.
That's probably what got things going.

60
00:04:23,146 --> 00:04:25,114
- What's that, Wilson?
- No more drilling.

61
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:27,172
It's going to be out-and-out fighting.

62
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,717
What are you talking about?

63
00:04:28,785 --> 00:04:30,980
A feller I know saw the orders.

64
00:04:31,054 --> 00:04:34,046
We'll go up the river, cut across,
and come around in behind them.

65
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:36,819
But why are we going up the river
instead of down...

66
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:38,588
where the land's flat and clear?

67
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:41,596
We could stand up to each other
and have a proper fight.

68
00:04:41,664 --> 00:04:44,929
This way, it's all hills.
We'll be climbing more than fighting.

69
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:47,595
<i>You don't understand, Bill Porter...</i>

70
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:50,266
<i>There was a youthful private...</i>

71
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,639
<i>who was deeply troubled
by the talk of his comrades.</i>

72
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,534
<i>They were so sure of their courage.</i>

73
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,270
Have you heard the news, Henry?

74
00:05:32,348 --> 00:05:33,838
You mean about the battle?

75
00:05:33,916 --> 00:05:38,182
Yeah. We're going up the river, cut across,
and come around in behind them.

76
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,690
Likely as not, this story will turn out
just like all them others did.

77
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:45,785
You just wait till tomorrow.
You'll see real out-and-out fighting.

78
00:05:45,862 --> 00:05:47,261
What do you think, Jim?

79
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,798
I can't believe
they'll keep drilling us forever...

80
00:05:49,866 --> 00:05:52,699
- and it's getting nigh onto that.
- Jim?

81
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:54,896
How do you think the regiment will do?

82
00:05:54,971 --> 00:05:57,030
They'll fight all right, once they get into it.

83
00:05:57,106 --> 00:06:00,075
We'll be on them like wildcats.
They won't know what hit them.

84
00:06:00,143 --> 00:06:01,838
Think any of the boys will run?

85
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:05,108
There may be a few,
but there's their kind in every regiment...

86
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:07,775
especially when they first go under fire.

87
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:10,080
But the boys come of good stock mostly.

88
00:06:10,186 --> 00:06:13,349
I figure they'll do better than some.
Worse than others.

89
00:06:13,423 --> 00:06:16,187
We'll chew them up
and spit them out in little pieces.

90
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:18,784
Did you ever think you might run,
too, Jim?

91
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:21,329
I thought it might
get too hot for Jim Conklin...

92
00:06:21,397 --> 00:06:23,160
in some of them scrimmages.

93
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:27,498
If a whole lot of the boys started to run,
I suppose I'd start and run.

94
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,404
If I once started to run,
I'd run like the mischief, and no mistake.

95
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:33,999
But if everybody
was standing and fighting...

96
00:06:34,077 --> 00:06:35,840
I'd stand and fight.

97
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:38,574
By Jiminy, I would. I'll bet on it.

98
00:06:40,016 --> 00:06:42,849
- What's wrong, Henry? Scared?
- Scared? Me?

99
00:06:43,619 --> 00:06:46,417
Of course not. What a dumbfool question!

100
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:49,251
I am, a mite.

101
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:59,091
<i>So they were at last going to fight.</i>

102
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:02,700
<i>Tomorrow, perhaps,
there would be a battle...</i>

103
00:07:03,239 --> 00:07:05,002
<i>and he would be in it.</i>

104
00:07:05,074 --> 00:07:09,511
<i>Was it possible that he would be
a part of a great battle in a great war?</i>

105
00:07:10,279 --> 00:07:14,010
<i>In the darkness he saw visions
of a thousand-tongued fear...</i>

106
00:07:14,884 --> 00:07:18,183
<i>who would babble at his back,
and cause him to flee.</i>

107
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:22,053
Who goes there?

108
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,025
It's me, Yank. Just me.

109
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:27,193
Move back into the shadows, Yank.

110
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:30,522
Unless you want
one of them little red badges.

111
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,592
I couldn't miss you,
standing there in the moonlight.

112
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:35,159
Are you a Reb?

113
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:36,637
That's right.

114
00:07:36,806 --> 00:07:40,537
I don't see much point
in us sentries shooting each other...

115
00:07:40,776 --> 00:07:43,677
especially when
we ain't fighting no battle.

116
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:46,304
So, if you'll just get out of the moonlight...

117
00:07:46,382 --> 00:07:48,509
I'll be much obliged to you.

118
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:50,276
Thanks, Reb.

119
00:07:50,353 --> 00:07:53,618
That's mighty polite of you, Yank,
to thank me.

120
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:57,926
I take it most kindly.
You're a right dumb good feller.

121
00:07:58,528 --> 00:08:00,428
So, take care of yourself.

122
00:08:00,496 --> 00:08:04,296
Don't go getting one of them
little red badges pinned on you.

123
00:08:13,676 --> 00:08:15,075
Left, march!

124
00:08:17,513 --> 00:08:19,413
Move. Halt!

125
00:08:23,286 --> 00:08:25,254
Forward arms!

126
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:29,755
Shoulder shift!

127
00:08:33,362 --> 00:08:34,886
"No more drilling," he says.

128
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:36,955
"That's all behind us now.

129
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,335
"From now on it's going to be
out-and-out fighting," he says.

130
00:08:40,403 --> 00:08:41,631
Forward!

131
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:43,602
Who says?

132
00:08:43,739 --> 00:08:46,333
- Why, Tom Wilson.
- What Tom Wilson?

133
00:08:46,409 --> 00:08:48,104
Arms out! Forward!

134
00:08:48,177 --> 00:08:50,475
The one who knows
everything in the worid.

135
00:08:50,546 --> 00:08:53,515
<i>- That Tom Wilson.
- You can all go...</i>

136
00:08:53,716 --> 00:08:57,447
We can all go up the river, cut across,
and come around in behind them.

137
00:08:57,553 --> 00:08:59,987
Wait till we fall out.
I'll learn you something.

138
00:09:00,056 --> 00:09:02,251
Private Wilson, step forward.

139
00:09:03,926 --> 00:09:06,224
Was that you talking in ranks? Speak up!

140
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,490
- Darn it all, Lieutenant.
- Answer yes or no.

141
00:09:08,564 --> 00:09:09,360
Yes, sir.

142
00:09:09,432 --> 00:09:12,128
Private Wilson, six hours extra duty.

143
00:09:12,935 --> 00:09:14,266
Fall back.

144
00:09:14,837 --> 00:09:16,998
Arms out! Forward!

145
00:09:18,574 --> 00:09:20,701
Two! Dismissed!

146
00:09:20,776 --> 00:09:23,006
I want a word with you, Porter.

147
00:09:24,714 --> 00:09:26,409
All we ever do is drill.

148
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,177
I'm getting mighty sick of it.

149
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,547
Thunder, I joined up to fight!

150
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,554
I want to smell gun smoke for once.

151
00:09:32,622 --> 00:09:35,489
What are these guns for, anyway,
to shoot or to drill with?

152
00:09:35,558 --> 00:09:37,150
Might as well be broomsticks.

153
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:41,356
We'll get our orders one of these days.
I reckon that day will come soon enough.

154
00:09:41,430 --> 00:09:42,829
Not for me, it won't.

155
00:09:42,898 --> 00:09:46,061
I wish I was as full of fight
as some of you fellas.

156
00:09:46,135 --> 00:09:49,070
Guess I just ain't high-spirited enough
to be a good soldier.

157
00:09:49,138 --> 00:09:50,105
Hey, fellas!

158
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:53,733
Tom Wilson and Bill Porter
are going to have a fistfight!

159
00:09:56,979 --> 00:09:59,880
- Hit him on the nose, Porter.
- Give it to him, Wilson!

160
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:02,144
Looks like they're scared of each other.

161
00:10:02,218 --> 00:10:05,915
How about a little action?
What is this, a fistfight or a round dance?

162
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,651
- Can I have the next waltz?
- Come on, let's see something!

163
00:10:17,099 --> 00:10:20,466
Grab your knapsacks! We're marching!

164
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,972
We're going!

165
00:10:25,174 --> 00:10:26,573
Here we go, boys!

166
00:10:26,976 --> 00:10:28,876
<i>He felt alone in space.</i>

167
00:10:29,945 --> 00:10:34,382
<i>No one else seemed to be wrestling
with such a terrific personal problem.</i>

168
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:37,319
<i>He was a mental outcast.</i>

169
00:11:16,826 --> 00:11:18,054
What did I tell you?

170
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:21,221
Are we going up the river or ain't we?
Who was right?

171
00:11:21,297 --> 00:11:23,629
Go on. Answer me,
you fellas who were laughing.

172
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:25,860
You was right. Nobody can deny that.

173
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:29,666
I heard some officers saying that
we had the Rebs where we want them.

174
00:11:29,739 --> 00:11:31,832
We'll give them a darned good thumping.

175
00:11:31,907 --> 00:11:33,875
They'll wish they'd stayed to home.

176
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:36,468
I hope this here gun shoots straight.

177
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:40,538
Wouldn't worry about it if I was you.
More about how steady I was holding it.

178
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,641
I wish I had my dog along.

179
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:45,946
First time I ever went hunting
without my old dog.

180
00:11:47,089 --> 00:11:50,217
I wonder what the name of
this here battle's going to be.

181
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:51,855
Company, halt!

182
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:54,423
At rest!

183
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,534
Go on, miss!
Catch him, hit him with your stick!

184
00:12:07,877 --> 00:12:10,539
How can you tell which one is the pig?

185
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,907
The pig's the cleanest, that's how.

186
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,007
The pig's better-looking, too.

187
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:18,520
We'll trade you the clean one
for the one in uniform.

188
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:23,858
Before you say yes, miss,
you better ask the pig.

189
00:12:23,926 --> 00:12:25,723
He might not like it.

190
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:30,494
And you'd better run!

191
00:13:00,229 --> 00:13:01,389
Henry?

192
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:06,535
What are you doing here?

193
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:07,960
Thinking.

194
00:13:08,037 --> 00:13:10,767
You're getting blue.
You're looking thundering peaked.

195
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:13,832
- What the dickens is wrong with you?
- Nothing.

196
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:16,704
We're going after them now.

197
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:19,543
By the eternal thunders,
we're going to lick them good.

198
00:13:19,615 --> 00:13:23,051
This time we're in for a big battle,
and we got the best end of it.

199
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,943
How we'll thump them.

200
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,554
You're going to do great things, I suppose.

201
00:13:27,623 --> 00:13:29,090
Great things?

202
00:13:29,992 --> 00:13:31,357
I don't know.

203
00:13:31,427 --> 00:13:35,386
My grandpappy fought with Washington.
It's in my blood, I reckon.

204
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,564
How do you know you won't run
when the time comes?

205
00:13:38,634 --> 00:13:40,568
Run? Me?

206
00:13:42,104 --> 00:13:44,095
Well, plenty of good-enough men...

207
00:13:44,173 --> 00:13:47,267
thought they'd do great things
before the fight...

208
00:13:47,343 --> 00:13:49,903
but when the time come, they skedaddled.

209
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:53,380
That's all true, I suppose.
But I'll do my share of the fighting.

210
00:13:53,449 --> 00:13:57,783
The man that bets on my running
is going to lose his money, that's all.

211
00:13:58,020 --> 00:14:00,488
You ain't the bravest man in the worid,
are you?

212
00:14:00,556 --> 00:14:03,992
No, I ain't. I didn't say
I was the bravest man in the worid, either.

213
00:14:04,059 --> 00:14:06,619
I said I was going to do
my share of the fighting.

214
00:14:06,695 --> 00:14:08,185
And I am, too.

215
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,068
Who are you, anyhow?
You talk like you was Napoleon Bonaparte.

216
00:14:15,671 --> 00:14:17,866
You needn't get mad about it.

217
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:35,249
All right, young man.
Get back in the ranks. No lagging behind.

218
00:15:37,286 --> 00:15:38,776
Forward march!

219
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,012
Forward march!

220
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:14,017
Form a line here!

221
00:16:14,089 --> 00:16:16,683
Everybody in the line by fours. March!

222
00:17:02,538 --> 00:17:05,735
I don't hold to laying down
and shooting from behind a hill.

223
00:17:05,808 --> 00:17:07,867
Wouldn't feel a bit proud doing it.

224
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:11,538
- Going to do my fighting standing up.
- Go ahead. Fight any way you please.

225
00:17:11,613 --> 00:17:15,413
What kind of a battle is this,
where fellers lay down to fight?

226
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:18,248
I'll fight standing up,
or I ain't going to fight at all.

227
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:20,481
You want to get shot,
that's your business.

228
00:17:20,556 --> 00:17:24,617
I ain't going to lay down before I'm shot,
and that's all there is to it.

229
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:31,627
Form your company and move on! Fall in!

230
00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:38,101
Right face!

231
00:17:38,173 --> 00:17:39,970
Turn left, march!

232
00:17:48,751 --> 00:17:50,719
Why are they marching us out of here?

233
00:17:50,786 --> 00:17:53,687
I can't stand this much longer.
I don't see any point to it.

234
00:17:53,756 --> 00:17:55,951
Me neither.
I'd like to know what's going on.

235
00:17:56,024 --> 00:17:59,619
We're being reconnoitered around
the center, to keep the Rebs from nearing.

236
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:01,219
Envelope them or something.

237
00:18:01,296 --> 00:18:03,662
I'd rather do anything
than tramping around...

238
00:18:03,732 --> 00:18:06,826
doing no good to anybody
and just wearing your legs out.

239
00:18:06,902 --> 00:18:08,392
So would I. It ain't right.

240
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:10,301
If anyone with sense was running...

241
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:12,932
Shut up, you darn little cuss!
You little fool!

242
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,738
You ain't had that coat and pants on
for six months.

243
00:18:15,811 --> 00:18:18,177
Yet you talk
as if you was George Washington.

244
00:18:18,247 --> 00:18:19,714
On the double!

245
00:18:49,745 --> 00:18:52,077
Captain, the Rebs
are on that hill over there.

246
00:18:52,147 --> 00:18:54,911
We'll to try to push them off.
Maybe we will, maybe not.

247
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:59,215
Take your positions on that road there,
and hold it whatever happens.

248
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:01,154
Fix bayonets!

249
00:19:10,465 --> 00:19:12,330
Here come our lancers.

250
00:20:27,209 --> 00:20:29,336
I thought
you were going to do your fighting...

251
00:20:33,382 --> 00:20:35,714
Do your fighting standing up.

252
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,184
Shut your dadburn mouth.

253
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,842
Henry, listen.

254
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:04,606
Something tells me
it's my first and last battle.

255
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,545
I'm a gone goose. I just know it.

256
00:21:06,615 --> 00:21:11,075
I want you to send this to my folks. They
gave it to me last year when I turned 21.

257
00:21:20,028 --> 00:21:22,758
Looks like we're getting a good licking.

258
00:21:36,878 --> 00:21:38,675
Go back! You cowards!

259
00:21:39,448 --> 00:21:41,473
Go back, you cowards!

260
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,677
Get back in there and fight!

261
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:46,017
Get back in there and fight!

262
00:21:46,588 --> 00:21:48,078
Go back, you cowards!

263
00:21:48,156 --> 00:21:50,386
I'm hit! I'm killed!

264
00:22:10,145 --> 00:22:12,136
The Rebs, they're coming.

265
00:22:12,647 --> 00:22:14,171
Hold your fire.

266
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:18,743
Hold your fire.

267
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:45,441
You've got to hold them back, Captain!
You've got to hold them back.

268
00:22:45,514 --> 00:22:47,505
All right, we'll do our best, sir.

269
00:22:47,582 --> 00:22:50,745
Lieutenant, you mind me.
We got to hold, no matter what happens.

270
00:22:50,819 --> 00:22:53,049
Yes, Captain. You men mind me.

271
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:55,620
We've got to hold! Can you hear me?

272
00:23:10,705 --> 00:23:12,036
Get ready.

273
00:23:16,978 --> 00:23:18,502
Hold your fire.

274
00:23:26,054 --> 00:23:27,146
Fire!

275
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,154
Give me this!

276
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,955
Here, fire!

277
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:19,005
Keep firing!

278
00:24:57,312 --> 00:25:00,304
The men look much bigger
through the powder smoke.

279
00:25:00,382 --> 00:25:02,646
Bayonets as thick as a spiked iron fence.

280
00:25:02,717 --> 00:25:05,242
I was so scared, my feet was frozen.

281
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,379
I never seen a man killed before.

282
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,885
Lost a pile of men, they did.

283
00:25:12,561 --> 00:25:14,222
We lost some, too.

284
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,793
Who's that?

285
00:25:15,897 --> 00:25:17,865
Gosh, it's Tim Foster.

286
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,766
It was him.

287
00:25:26,107 --> 00:25:28,541
They're carrying in the hurt Rebs.

288
00:25:30,512 --> 00:25:33,777
I hope there won't be no more fighting
till a week from Monday.

289
00:25:33,848 --> 00:25:36,874
Unless I miss my guess,
them Rebs got their bellies full.

290
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,887
We showed them
some real fighting, all right.

291
00:25:41,523 --> 00:25:43,650
<i>So it was all over at last.</i>

292
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:46,793
<i>The supreme trial had been passed.</i>

293
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:50,989
<i>The red, formidable difficulties of war
had been vanquished.</i>

294
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:58,161
<i>He felt that he was a fine fellow.</i>

295
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:01,671
<i>He saw himself even, with those ideals...</i>

296
00:26:01,743 --> 00:26:04,541
<i>which he had considered
as far beyond him.</i>

297
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,653
A ball shot off my kneecap.

298
00:26:21,062 --> 00:26:22,927
Somebody come help me.

299
00:26:23,064 --> 00:26:24,531
Help me, somebody.

300
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:26,726
I can't let go of this tree.

301
00:26:26,835 --> 00:26:29,167
Look, a ball shot off my kneecap.

302
00:26:29,237 --> 00:26:30,898
Help me, somebody.

303
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:33,739
<i>- A ball shot off...
- Bleeding like a cow.</i>

304
00:26:33,808 --> 00:26:36,242
Bleeding like a darned cow, it is.

305
00:26:37,412 --> 00:26:39,903
Here, let me bind that leg for you.

306
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:42,139
Bleeding like a cow, it is.

307
00:26:42,217 --> 00:26:44,811
Can't seem to stop her from bleeding.

308
00:27:04,039 --> 00:27:05,836
Here they come again!

309
00:27:10,945 --> 00:27:12,742
They're coming at us.

310
00:27:22,324 --> 00:27:23,791
<i>The youth stared.</i>

311
00:27:23,858 --> 00:27:27,726
<i>Surely, he thought, this impossible thing
was not about to happen.</i>

312
00:27:27,796 --> 00:27:30,959
<i>He waited as if he expected
the enemy to suddenly stop...</i>

313
00:27:31,032 --> 00:27:33,159
<i>apologize, and retire bowing.</i>

314
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:35,699
<i>It was all a mistake.</i>

315
00:28:12,006 --> 00:28:13,268
Get back!

316
00:28:14,476 --> 00:28:15,738
Get back!

317
00:28:16,811 --> 00:28:19,245
I'll have you shot for a deserter!

318
00:29:35,256 --> 00:29:38,783
Taylor's rushing his men.
They'll reach the woods before we know it.

319
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:40,088
We can't have that.

320
00:29:40,161 --> 00:29:42,493
They'll be worn out
before they're committed.

321
00:29:42,564 --> 00:29:45,658
I'd give my shoulder straps
for a fresh brigade.

322
00:29:46,501 --> 00:29:48,435
Tompkins, go over and see Taylor.

323
00:29:48,503 --> 00:29:50,437
Tell him not to be in such a hurry...

324
00:29:50,505 --> 00:29:54,271
to stop his brigade on the edge
of the woods, come to detach a regiment.

325
00:29:54,342 --> 00:29:57,470
The center will break unless we help it.
And tell him to hurry up.

326
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,807
Yes, sir.

327
00:30:02,517 --> 00:30:03,984
We've held them, General.

328
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,853
Held them, have they?
We'll wallop them now!

329
00:30:06,921 --> 00:30:08,354
We've got them sure!

330
00:30:08,423 --> 00:30:09,981
Jons, ride after Tompkins.

331
00:30:10,058 --> 00:30:13,050
- See Taylor, and tell him to go in.
- Yes, sir.

332
00:30:13,661 --> 00:30:16,562
- Colonel, you inform Whiterside.
- Yes, sir!

333
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:18,394
They've held them, by heavens!

334
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:41,245
<i>The youth cringed,
as if discovered in a crime.</i>

335
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,424
<i>So his regiment had won after all.</i>

336
00:30:45,493 --> 00:30:47,984
<i>His imbecile comrades had remained.</i>

337
00:30:48,796 --> 00:30:51,993
<i>And their very ignorance
had brought them victory.</i>

338
00:30:52,634 --> 00:30:54,261
<i>He felt betrayed.</i>

339
00:30:55,069 --> 00:30:59,233
<i>He wondered what they would remark,
when later he appeared in camp.</i>

340
00:30:59,374 --> 00:31:01,774
<i>His mind heard howls of derisión.</i>

341
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:28,699
Don't jostle so, Johnson, you fool!
You think my leg's made of iron?

342
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:31,364
If you can't carry me decent,
let someone else do it.

343
00:31:31,439 --> 00:31:33,464
Make way there, can't you?

344
00:31:34,275 --> 00:31:37,005
Who does he think he is?
Some lunkhead of a general?

345
00:31:37,078 --> 00:31:40,309
There's the kind that get the privileges.
Small wounds, big talk.

346
00:31:40,381 --> 00:31:42,872
You just wait,
you won't get by with your insults.

347
00:31:42,951 --> 00:31:45,317
I'll have you all court-martialed!

348
00:31:45,386 --> 00:31:48,651
<i>He regarded the wounded soldiers
in an envious way.</i>

349
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:52,082
<i>He conceived persons
with torn bodies to be...</i>

350
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,252
<i>peculiarly happy.</i>

351
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,854
<i>He wished that he, too, had a wound.</i>

352
00:31:57,098 --> 00:31:59,089
<i>A red badge of courage.</i>

353
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,239
Pretty good fight, wasn't it?

354
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:47,806
Pretty good fight, wasn't it?

355
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:50,316
Darn me, if I ever seen fellas fight so.

356
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:52,376
Lord, how they did fight.

357
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:56,212
I knew the boys would be all right
once they got square at it.

358
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,850
They ain't had no fair chance up to now.

359
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:00,917
This time they showed what they was.

360
00:33:00,995 --> 00:33:03,327
I knew they'd turn out this way.

361
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:05,832
You can't lick them boys. No, sir.

362
00:33:06,467 --> 00:33:08,492
They're fighters, they be.

363
00:33:09,003 --> 00:33:11,096
Where are you hit, old boy?

364
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:13,701
Where are you hit?

365
00:33:17,045 --> 00:33:18,307
Make way!

366
00:33:40,735 --> 00:33:41,759
Jim.

367
00:33:42,236 --> 00:33:43,635
Jim Conklin.

368
00:33:48,009 --> 00:33:49,476
Hello, Henry.

369
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:51,468
Where you been?

370
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:54,905
I thought maybe you got keeled over.

371
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,484
There's been thunder to pay today.

372
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:01,511
I was wondering about it a good eon.

373
00:34:06,294 --> 00:34:09,024
You know, I was out there...

374
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:11,693
and, what a circus.

375
00:34:12,700 --> 00:34:14,031
By Jiminy.

376
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:15,934
I got shot.

377
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,069
I got shot.

378
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:24,068
I'll tell you what I'm scared of.

379
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,545
I'll tell you what I'm afraid of.

380
00:34:26,681 --> 00:34:31,084
I'm afraid I'll fall down, and then you
know them darned artillery wagons...

381
00:34:31,786 --> 00:34:33,913
they're like to run over me.

382
00:34:34,088 --> 00:34:36,113
That's what I'm afraid of.

383
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:40,156
You don't have to worry, Jim.

384
00:34:40,228 --> 00:34:44,562
- I'll take care of you. I swear I will.
- Sure? Will you, Henry?

385
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:45,825
Sure, Jim.

386
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,358
I've always been a good friend to you,
wasn't I, Henry?

387
00:34:49,637 --> 00:34:53,801
I've always been a pretty good fella.
It ain't much to ask, is it...

388
00:34:54,442 --> 00:34:57,036
just to pull me along out of the road?

389
00:34:57,111 --> 00:34:59,739
I'd do it for you, wouldn't I?

390
00:35:03,951 --> 00:35:04,975
No.

391
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:13,893
Better get him out of the road.
There's a battery coming.

392
00:35:13,961 --> 00:35:15,952
He'll get run over for sure.

393
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:18,260
He's a goner anyhow,
in about five minutes.

394
00:35:18,332 --> 00:35:22,234
- We'd better get him out of the road.
- Jim, come out of the road.

395
00:35:22,603 --> 00:35:24,264
Move off the road!

396
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,347
Look where he's running.

397
00:35:43,658 --> 00:35:44,750
Jim.

398
00:35:45,827 --> 00:35:47,818
Jim, what are you doing?

399
00:35:58,005 --> 00:35:59,063
No.

400
00:36:01,809 --> 00:36:03,367
Don't touch me.

401
00:36:03,945 --> 00:36:05,344
Leave me be...

402
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,345
can't you? For a minute?

403
00:36:11,652 --> 00:36:14,712
Jim, what are you doing?
What made you do this?

404
00:36:15,957 --> 00:36:17,015
No.

405
00:36:20,061 --> 00:36:21,460
Leave me be.

406
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,241
He were a regular jim-dandy, weren't he?

407
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,076
A regular jim-dandy.

408
00:37:17,585 --> 00:37:19,985
I wonder where he got his strength from.

409
00:37:20,054 --> 00:37:22,887
I've never seen a man do like that before.

410
00:37:24,458 --> 00:37:26,585
He were a regular jim-dandy.

411
00:38:35,129 --> 00:38:37,791
What's happening over there?
What's the matter?

412
00:38:37,865 --> 00:38:40,356
- What are you running from?
- Let go!

413
00:38:40,935 --> 00:38:43,529
- What's happening over there?
- Let go.

414
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:16,360
You're in a pretty bad fix, son.
Well, I'm going your way.

415
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:18,667
Come on. I'll give you a lift.

416
00:39:19,507 --> 00:39:21,304
What's your regiment?

417
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:23,241
Volunteers?

418
00:39:23,844 --> 00:39:27,439
- 304th, I'll betcha.
- Maybe there ain't none of us left.

419
00:39:27,515 --> 00:39:31,212
You'd be surprised at how many of you
is still alive and kicking.

420
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:34,618
Always seems like more of you
is getting killed than there are.

421
00:39:35,423 --> 00:39:38,119
- I don't think we're going right.
- Just stick with me.

422
00:39:38,192 --> 00:39:42,595
I'll find your regiment for you.
I wonder who won today, us or the Rebs?

423
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:45,092
Reckon nobody knows,
not even the General.

424
00:39:45,166 --> 00:39:49,296
'Course, they'll say we won a big victory.
Got to keep the people's spirits up...

425
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:50,860
especially the womenfolk.

426
00:39:50,938 --> 00:39:54,772
They're mighty apt to get discouraged
with their husbands and sons away.

427
00:39:54,842 --> 00:39:58,403
Corporal, that the 304th down there?

428
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,970
I just passed it in that clearing, behind me.

429
00:40:01,048 --> 00:40:03,573
You see? I knew we was going right.

430
00:40:04,418 --> 00:40:07,353
I gave myself up for dead
any number of times.

431
00:40:07,421 --> 00:40:09,651
There was so much
shooting and hollering...

432
00:40:09,723 --> 00:40:12,851
you couldn't tell, to save your soul,
which side you was on.

433
00:40:12,927 --> 00:40:15,487
It was the most mixed-up thing
you ever did see.

434
00:40:15,563 --> 00:40:18,430
When I saw what I did today,
I said, "There ain't no use...

435
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:20,228
"worrying about yourself.

436
00:40:20,301 --> 00:40:23,634
"Just turn your affairs over to the Lord,
and go on and do your duty.

437
00:40:23,704 --> 00:40:25,934
"Then, if you get killed, it's his concern.

438
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,133
"Anyway, dying is only dying.

439
00:40:28,209 --> 00:40:30,700
"Supposing you don't hear
the birds sing tomorrow...

440
00:40:30,778 --> 00:40:33,542
"or see the sun go down,
it's going to happen anyway."

441
00:40:33,614 --> 00:40:36,777
And you know, son,
that thought gave me peace of mind.

442
00:40:37,118 --> 00:40:40,576
You ought to write your folks a letter,
and tell them you ain't killed.

443
00:40:40,654 --> 00:40:42,281
There's your regiment.

444
00:40:42,356 --> 00:40:45,814
Goodbye and good luck,
and may the good Lord watch after you.

445
00:40:45,893 --> 00:40:49,693
<i>Oh, happy am I. Oh, happy am I</i>

446
00:40:55,169 --> 00:40:56,693
Who goes there?

447
00:41:00,174 --> 00:41:01,664
Hello, Wilson.

448
00:41:05,479 --> 00:41:06,969
Henry Fleming.

449
00:41:07,448 --> 00:41:11,214
- Yeah, it's me.
- Well, by ginger, I'm glad to see you.

450
00:41:11,285 --> 00:41:14,345
I gave you up for a goner.
I thought you was dead, sure enough.

451
00:41:14,421 --> 00:41:17,982
I've had an awful time.
I've been way over on the right.

452
00:41:18,159 --> 00:41:21,356
I got separated from the regiment.
Terrible fighting over there.

453
00:41:21,428 --> 00:41:23,259
- And I got shot.
- Got shot?

454
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,163
- I got shot in the head.
- Why didn't you say so right off?

455
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:29,066
- Wait, I'll call the corporal.
- Who are you talking to?

456
00:41:29,136 --> 00:41:31,331
You're the darndest sentinel.

457
00:41:31,438 --> 00:41:33,668
Why, hello, Fleming. You here?

458
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,369
I thought you was dead hours ago.
Where was you?

459
00:41:36,443 --> 00:41:39,412
- Over on the right. I got separated.
- He got shot in the head.

460
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:41,948
He's in a terrible fix.
I ought to look after him.

461
00:41:42,016 --> 00:41:44,541
All right. Better take care of him.

462
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:49,446
It hurts. It hurts like blazes.

463
00:41:50,124 --> 00:41:53,924
It's been bleeding all the way here,
but it's stopped now, I guess.

464
00:41:53,994 --> 00:41:56,189
Terrible pain when I got hit.

465
00:41:56,564 --> 00:41:58,759
I must have been unconscious
for a long time.

466
00:41:58,832 --> 00:42:02,063
When I come to, I thought I'd keel over
from the hurt it gave me...

467
00:42:02,136 --> 00:42:04,036
when I started walking.

468
00:42:06,407 --> 00:42:09,308
You know,
I might have a bullet in the head.

469
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:12,806
A wound like that's likely to be fatal.

470
00:42:12,913 --> 00:42:16,314
Let's have a look at your head.
Maybe it's a bad one.

471
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,619
You're mighty lucky.
It ain't as bad as you feared.

472
00:42:22,756 --> 00:42:24,451
You've been grazed by a ball.

473
00:42:24,525 --> 00:42:26,220
Raised a queer sort of a lump...

474
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:29,160
as if some fella
had lammed you on the head with a club.

475
00:42:29,897 --> 00:42:33,924
The most of it is that in the morning
you'll feel a number 10 hat wouldn't fit.

476
00:42:34,568 --> 00:42:37,935
Might get some other ailments, too.
You can't never tell.

477
00:42:38,005 --> 00:42:39,597
Still, I don't much think so.

478
00:42:39,673 --> 00:42:42,801
It's just a dang good belt on the head,
nothing more.

479
00:42:42,876 --> 00:42:45,367
I'll have you fixed up in about a minute.

480
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,441
You don't holler or say nothing.

481
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:52,150
I'm a blacksmith
at taking care of ailing folks.

482
00:42:52,219 --> 00:42:55,347
And you never even squeaked.
You're a brave one.

483
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:58,253
Most men would have been
in the hospital long ago.

484
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,690
- Tom.
- Yeah?

485
00:43:03,364 --> 00:43:05,093
Jim Conklin's dead.

486
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:07,497
What? Jim Conklin's dead?

487
00:43:09,003 --> 00:43:10,595
Yeah, he's dead.

488
00:43:11,372 --> 00:43:13,772
You don't say. Jim Conklin.

489
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:16,540
Poor cuss.

490
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,643
Come on, we'll put you to bed
and get you a night's sleep.

491
00:43:24,285 --> 00:43:26,913
Just lie down there and get some rest.

492
00:43:31,992 --> 00:43:33,619
- Tom.
- Yes, Henry?

493
00:43:35,129 --> 00:43:38,758
Did the Lieutenant or anyone
say anything about me being missing?

494
00:43:38,832 --> 00:43:39,856
No.

495
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:43,399
The regiment lost over half its men,
and I thought they was all dead.

496
00:43:43,470 --> 00:43:46,997
But they keep coming back.
Seems we didn't lose but a few.

497
00:43:47,074 --> 00:43:48,666
They were scattered all over.

498
00:43:48,742 --> 00:43:52,041
Meandering around, and fighting
with other regiments, just like you.

499
00:43:58,585 --> 00:44:00,610
I brought your watch back.

500
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:05,619
Thanks.

501
00:45:45,225 --> 00:45:48,126
<i>He had performed his mistakes
in the dark...</i>

502
00:45:48,762 --> 00:45:50,627
<i>so he was still a man.</i>

503
00:46:10,217 --> 00:46:14,119
What do you think the chances are?
You think we'll wallop them?

504
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:17,351
Not if we don't do a lot better
than we done yesterday.

505
00:46:17,424 --> 00:46:19,858
Where I was, over on the right...

506
00:46:20,327 --> 00:46:22,693
I'd say that we was getting
a good pounding.

507
00:46:22,763 --> 00:46:24,822
I thought we handled them pretty rough.

508
00:46:24,898 --> 00:46:28,095
Not at all.
Why, you didn't see none of the fight.

509
00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,898
None compared to what you saw, I guess.

510
00:46:31,138 --> 00:46:33,368
Maybe we are in for a licking.

511
00:46:34,508 --> 00:46:37,306
What's got into you?
Day before yesterday...

512
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,471
you was going to lick
the whole caboodle, all by yourself.

513
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:41,707
Was I?

514
00:46:42,282 --> 00:46:43,772
Perhaps I was.

515
00:46:44,318 --> 00:46:47,082
- No, you wasn't, neither.
- You needn't mind, Henry.

516
00:46:47,154 --> 00:46:49,952
I reckon I was a pretty big fool
in those days.

517
00:46:50,023 --> 00:46:53,982
You talk like it was years ago,
instead of day before yesterday.

518
00:46:54,695 --> 00:46:56,322
Seems like years.

519
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:02,998
Company, fall in!

520
00:47:15,015 --> 00:47:17,483
We're always being
pushed around like rats.

521
00:47:17,551 --> 00:47:18,916
Makes me sick.

522
00:47:18,986 --> 00:47:21,921
Nobody seems to know
where we're going or why we're going.

523
00:47:21,989 --> 00:47:24,583
We're kicked around from pillar to post.

524
00:47:24,658 --> 00:47:26,853
Why were we marched into these woods...

525
00:47:26,927 --> 00:47:29,657
except to give the Rebs
a regular potshot at us?

526
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:32,290
Come in here and
get our legs tangled in briers.

527
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:35,301
Then we fight, and the Rebs
have an easy time whipping us.

528
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:38,202
- It'll turn out all right.
- The devil it will.

529
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:40,433
Our generals are a bunch of lunkheads.

530
00:47:40,507 --> 00:47:43,772
You think you fit the battle
by yourself yesterday.

531
00:47:44,011 --> 00:47:47,003
No, I don't think I fit
the whole battle myself.

532
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:48,138
You boys shut up.

533
00:47:48,215 --> 00:47:50,877
Don't waste your breath
in long-winded arguments.

534
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:54,751
You been squawking like old hens.
No need to do anything but fight.

535
00:47:54,821 --> 00:47:57,949
You'll get plenty of that in 10 minutes.
I've never seen such fools.

536
00:47:58,025 --> 00:48:01,927
Lieutenant, there's your position.
Get in quick, and fight like everything!

537
00:48:01,995 --> 00:48:05,226
- We may be attacked at any minute.
- Come along, men!

538
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:08,826
<i>Hop on your bellies against that bank!
The first rule is fire...</i>

539
00:48:23,617 --> 00:48:24,709
Fire!

540
00:48:50,978 --> 00:48:52,843
By diddy, here we are.

541
00:48:53,246 --> 00:48:56,079
Everybody fighting. Blood and destruction.

542
00:49:07,294 --> 00:49:08,386
Fire!

543
00:49:41,294 --> 00:49:43,956
- They're coming right at us.
- They'd better watch out.

544
00:49:44,031 --> 00:49:47,797
If they keep on hitting at us
they just better watch out!

545
00:49:47,868 --> 00:49:48,994
That's all I say.

546
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,970
They keep on hitting at us,
they'll knock us into the river.

547
00:49:52,039 --> 00:49:53,836
The devil they will!

548
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:20,858
Fire!

549
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:29,003
<i>The youth was not conscious
that he was erect upon his feet.</i>

550
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:31,510
<i>He lost every sense but his hate.</i>

551
00:50:32,479 --> 00:50:36,006
<i>For the first time in his life,
he was possessed by a great passión:</i>

552
00:50:36,083 --> 00:50:38,483
<i>The passión to destroy the enemy.</i>

553
00:50:39,319 --> 00:50:42,083
<i>He felt the power of an army in himself.</i>

554
00:50:42,556 --> 00:50:45,787
<i>He was a battle cry, a bullet, a sword.</i>

555
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:48,460
Fleming, you fool!

556
00:50:48,729 --> 00:50:51,960
Don't you know enough to quit
when there ain't nothing to shoot at?

557
00:50:52,032 --> 00:50:53,659
Get back in here!

558
00:51:10,484 --> 00:51:14,250
If I had 10,000 wildcats like you,
I could tear the stomach out of this war...

559
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,881
in less than a week, that's what I could do.

560
00:51:16,957 --> 00:51:19,983
- Did you ever see such a wildcat?
- You all right?

561
00:51:20,060 --> 00:51:24,326
You feel all right? There ain't nothing
wrong with you, is there?

562
00:51:24,798 --> 00:51:28,962
Get mad, that's all you got to do.
And get this war over in a hurry.

563
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:32,999
By thunder, I bet this army
ain't got another regiment like us.

564
00:51:33,073 --> 00:51:34,301
You bet.

565
00:51:34,407 --> 00:51:36,500
"A woman, a dog and a walnut tree.

566
00:51:36,576 --> 00:51:38,806
"The more you beat them,
the better they be."

567
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,541
- I'm just dying of thirst.
- Me, too.

568
00:51:42,649 --> 00:51:46,107
I figure there ought to be a creek
over in those woods.

569
00:51:49,322 --> 00:51:51,517
Sir, can me and Fleming
go after some water?

570
00:51:51,591 --> 00:51:54,583
- I think I know where there's a creek.
- Okay, but come back.

571
00:51:54,661 --> 00:51:56,788
- Take my canteen.
- Take mine.

572
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,879
Enemy's forming for another charge.
It'll be directed against Whiterside.

573
00:52:23,957 --> 00:52:26,255
They'll break through
unless we can stop them.

574
00:52:26,326 --> 00:52:29,659
- It'll be the dickens to pay stopping them.
- What troops can we spare?

575
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:33,825
The 12th was ordered in to help the 76th.
We haven't really got any.

576
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,494
There's the 304th.
They fight like mule drivers.

577
00:52:36,570 --> 00:52:38,970
- We can spare them best of any.
- Get them ready.

578
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,564
I'll send word when to start,
be about five minutes.

579
00:52:41,641 --> 00:52:42,505
Yes, sir.

580
00:52:44,211 --> 00:52:47,112
Not many of your mule drivers
will get back.

581
00:52:51,318 --> 00:52:54,151
That was the General, the General himself.

582
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,619
He's talking about us.

583
00:53:01,561 --> 00:53:04,758
How long does it take to get water?
Where you been to?

584
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:07,459
- Well, speak up!
- We're going to attack.

585
00:53:07,534 --> 00:53:12,096
- Attack? Who said so? How do you know?
- We heard the General say so himself.

586
00:53:12,172 --> 00:53:15,733
He said the enemy's forming
for another charge against Whiterside.

587
00:53:15,809 --> 00:53:20,439
- The officer said he could spare the 304th...
- We'll be attacking any minute.

588
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,842
Attack?

589
00:53:23,049 --> 00:53:25,745
By Jiminy, this is what I call real fighting.

590
00:53:25,819 --> 00:53:28,811
- Attack. By Jiminy!
- Well, I'll be darned.

591
00:53:28,889 --> 00:53:31,187
- Attack? What for?
- Wonder why they picked us.

592
00:53:31,258 --> 00:53:33,385
Get your men set. We're going to attack.

593
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:36,258
Let's see a good, straight line now, men.

594
00:53:36,897 --> 00:53:38,228
Attention!

595
00:53:39,399 --> 00:53:40,388
At ease.

596
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,095
- Good afternoon, boys.
- Good afternoon, General.

597
00:53:43,169 --> 00:53:46,605
We're going to give the Rebs
a darn good licking today.

598
00:53:46,673 --> 00:53:49,733
- What are you having for supper tonight?
- Hardtack and sowbelly.

599
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:52,334
- I'll be around if you fix an extra plate.
- Be an honor.

600
00:53:52,412 --> 00:53:54,744
- Good luck.
- Thank you, General.

601
00:54:01,554 --> 00:54:02,782
At ease.

602
00:54:02,856 --> 00:54:05,120
- Good afternoon, boys.
- Afternoon, General.

603
00:54:05,191 --> 00:54:08,285
We'll give the Rebs
a good licking today, won't we?

604
00:54:08,361 --> 00:54:11,228
- What are you having for supper?
- Hardtack and sowbelly.

605
00:54:11,298 --> 00:54:15,029
- I'll be around if you fix an extra plate.
- It would be a great honor.

606
00:54:16,202 --> 00:54:17,567
Attention!

607
00:54:18,038 --> 00:54:21,098
- At ease, boys. At ease.
- Attention!

608
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:24,738
Good afternoon, Captain.
What are you having for supper tonight?

609
00:54:24,811 --> 00:54:27,939
- Hardtack and sowbelly, sir.
- Mind if I eat with you tonight?

610
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:32,178
All right. After you've licked the Rebs,
we'll all have supper together.

611
00:54:32,252 --> 00:54:33,583
Good luck.

612
00:54:33,887 --> 00:54:36,185
- At ease, boys.
- Attention!

613
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:38,715
- Howdy, boys.
- Howdy, General.

614
00:54:38,792 --> 00:54:40,783
Good afternoon, General.

615
00:54:42,195 --> 00:54:44,459
At ease. Howdy, Jim.

616
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:46,761
- Howdy, General.
- How are those wounds?

617
00:54:46,833 --> 00:54:49,028
Stinging some, General,
but they're mending.

618
00:54:49,102 --> 00:54:51,127
Fine. Anybody want a chaw?

619
00:54:52,105 --> 00:54:55,199
- Thank you, General.
- You've got a hole in your cap, Lieutenant.

620
00:54:55,275 --> 00:54:56,936
Bullet hole, sir.

621
00:54:57,911 --> 00:55:00,106
- Well, good luck, boys.
- Thank you, sir.

622
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:04,173
- Having supper with us tonight, General?
- Go to blazes, Corporal!

623
00:55:16,763 --> 00:55:18,560
I hear the gamecocks.

624
00:55:24,838 --> 00:55:26,465
Sound the attack.

625
00:55:35,382 --> 00:55:37,247
Thy will be done, sir.

626
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:48,944
On the double!

627
00:57:33,533 --> 00:57:37,731
You fellas! Come on!
All we got to do is cross this here field.

628
00:57:37,804 --> 00:57:41,001
What are you,
soldiers or a bunch of mule drivers?

629
00:57:41,141 --> 00:57:42,403
Come on!

630
00:58:18,945 --> 00:58:21,413
- Here they come.
- They're right on us, by Jiminy!

631
00:58:21,481 --> 00:58:23,915
Pull them quick and take good aim.

632
00:58:52,212 --> 00:58:55,272
Come on, men! Follow them!
We've got them now.

633
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:58,812
After them. Forward, men, forward!

634
00:58:58,885 --> 00:59:00,512
- Come on.
- Forward!

635
00:59:01,454 --> 00:59:02,614
Charge!

636
00:59:53,606 --> 00:59:54,834
Charge!

637
01:01:20,893 --> 01:01:23,225
Don't take it too hard, old boy.

638
01:01:24,163 --> 01:01:25,858
I wish I was dead.

639
01:01:25,965 --> 01:01:28,456
I just wish I was dead, that's all.

640
01:01:29,802 --> 01:01:31,827
I'd a heap rather be dead.

641
01:01:33,072 --> 01:01:34,300
I run out of powder.

642
01:01:34,374 --> 01:01:37,104
I'd have killed another Yankee
if I'd had powder.

643
01:01:37,176 --> 01:01:40,339
- You're lucky you weren't killed yourself.
- Want a drink of water?

644
01:01:40,413 --> 01:01:42,608
- Not Yankee water.
- It's Reb water.

645
01:01:42,682 --> 01:01:44,707
My canteen, but it's Reb water.

646
01:01:45,418 --> 01:01:48,751
- What state are you fellers from?
- We're all from Tennessee.

647
01:01:49,822 --> 01:01:51,915
- How about y'all?
- We're from Ohio.

648
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,793
I never spoke to nobody from Ohio before.

649
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:58,689
I never spoke to nobody from Tennessee.
What's your name?

650
01:02:00,566 --> 01:02:03,228
- Lucius M. Pettigrew.
- I'm Bill Porter.

651
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:06,864
- You just oughta heard.
- Heard what?

652
01:02:06,939 --> 01:02:10,705
The Colonel and the Captain was talking,
and the Colonel says:

653
01:02:10,777 --> 01:02:14,713
"Captain Allworth, by the way,
who was the lad that carried the flag?"

654
01:02:14,781 --> 01:02:16,544
What do you think of that?

655
01:02:16,616 --> 01:02:19,107
"Who was the lad that carried the flag?"
He says.

656
01:02:19,185 --> 01:02:23,053
And the Captain says,
"That's Fleming, and he's a jim-hickey."

657
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:27,450
It happened right by us.
And the Colonel, he says:

658
01:02:27,527 --> 01:02:30,018
"He is, indeed.
He kept the flag way to the front.

659
01:02:30,096 --> 01:02:32,326
"I saw him. He's a good one."

660
01:02:32,565 --> 01:02:35,261
"Yes," says the Captain.
"He and a feller named Wilson.

661
01:02:35,334 --> 01:02:38,929
"They was at the head of the charge,
howling like Indians all the time.

662
01:02:39,005 --> 01:02:43,203
- "A feller named Wilson," he said.
- Go to blazes. He never said that.

663
01:02:43,276 --> 01:02:46,006
He did, too. And then the Colonel says:

664
01:02:46,579 --> 01:02:49,776
"Were they indeed?
My sakes, those two babies?"

665
01:02:49,849 --> 01:02:53,376
"They were," says the Captain.
"Well," says the Colonel...

666
01:02:53,453 --> 01:02:56,616
- "they deserve to be major generals."
- What a lie.

667
01:02:56,689 --> 01:02:58,554
That's the truth. I heard it myself.

668
01:02:58,624 --> 01:03:01,525
We was there, Fleming,
and it's just as Thompson told you.

669
01:03:19,212 --> 01:03:21,908
That old Colonel's a right smart feller.

670
01:03:23,983 --> 01:03:27,419
Tom, there's something
I just got to get off my chest.

671
01:03:27,954 --> 01:03:29,353
What's that?

672
01:03:30,389 --> 01:03:33,256
Yesterday,
when things started getting hot...

673
01:03:33,326 --> 01:03:34,554
I was mighty scared.

674
01:03:34,627 --> 01:03:36,458
- We all was.
- Yeah.

675
01:03:37,730 --> 01:03:39,254
But I lit out.

676
01:03:39,932 --> 01:03:42,127
You mean you ran away, Henry?

677
01:03:45,104 --> 01:03:48,039
Not very far. I was only scared
for a minute, you understand.

678
01:03:48,107 --> 01:03:50,098
Just a minute.

679
01:03:50,176 --> 01:03:51,939
After that, I was that ashamed...

680
01:03:52,011 --> 01:03:54,571
that I couldn't get back
in the fight soon enough.

681
01:03:55,348 --> 01:03:58,749
Instead of looking for you fellas,
I just threw in over on the right...

682
01:03:58,818 --> 01:04:00,615
and went to fighting.

683
01:04:03,155 --> 01:04:05,919
There, now, I told you all there is.

684
01:04:06,792 --> 01:04:09,727
I'm glad you did,
because it makes me feel a sight better.

685
01:04:09,795 --> 01:04:13,891
I skedaddled myself yesterday,
when about half the other fellas did.

686
01:04:13,966 --> 01:04:16,662
Only, the Captain caught me
and made me stay.

687
01:04:16,736 --> 01:04:19,466
Reckon I was more scared of him
than I was of the Rebs.

688
01:04:25,011 --> 01:04:28,003
I guess confessión's good for a fella, Tom.

689
01:04:30,249 --> 01:04:33,275
What I mean is, it's good for the soul.

690
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,613
Look! They're our fellas.

691
01:04:38,858 --> 01:04:40,325
I'll be doggoned.

692
01:04:40,393 --> 01:04:43,157
I didn't know any of our fellas
was over that way.

693
01:04:43,229 --> 01:04:44,287
Howdy!

694
01:04:44,363 --> 01:04:47,264
Howdy, boys. Seen any Rebs?
We're hunting them.

695
01:04:47,333 --> 01:04:50,063
There was a whole passel of Rebs here
a minute ago.

696
01:04:50,136 --> 01:04:51,660
We chased them off the wall.

697
01:04:51,737 --> 01:04:55,173
Do tell. We heard you fellers
shooting down this way...

698
01:04:55,274 --> 01:04:58,038
but we figured you was shooting at crows.

699
01:04:58,144 --> 01:05:00,704
Crows? We was fighting a battle!

700
01:05:01,013 --> 01:05:02,742
- You hear that?
- What was that?

701
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:05,682
You darned fools,
the battle was over that hill...

702
01:05:05,751 --> 01:05:07,582
where we was with Whiterside.

703
01:05:07,653 --> 01:05:10,121
Whiterside? Who's Whiterside?

704
01:05:10,756 --> 01:05:14,817
Why, just the best darned general
in the whole Northern Army.

705
01:05:15,227 --> 01:05:16,956
Never heard of him.

706
01:05:21,267 --> 01:05:23,895
- Go to the rear and assemble.
- Fall in!

707
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:31,066
Right, march!

708
01:06:02,208 --> 01:06:05,200
After all the trouble we went to
getting that wall...

709
01:06:05,277 --> 01:06:07,404
I'd like to set by it a little while.

710
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:10,347
Is it a fact?
Is the credit for winning this battle...

711
01:06:10,416 --> 01:06:13,214
going to old what's-his-name? Whiterside?

712
01:06:13,586 --> 01:06:14,951
I allow it is.

713
01:06:15,021 --> 01:06:18,047
If I'd have known that,
I wouldn't have charged nohow.

714
01:06:18,124 --> 01:06:21,787
Anyway, the Rebs didn't win.
That's something to be thankful for.

715
01:06:21,861 --> 01:06:24,056
I'm thankful I'm all in one piece.

716
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:27,827
Me, too. I got holes in my cap,
holes in my pants...

717
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:32,127
but there ain't no holes in me,
except the ones that was intended.

718
01:06:33,739 --> 01:06:36,799
You know,
it's mighty pretty country around here.

719
01:06:36,876 --> 01:06:40,835
I mean, it would be
if they wasn't fighting battles all over it.

720
01:06:44,784 --> 01:06:48,413
- Sun's going down.
- Days are getting shorter all the time.

721
01:06:48,487 --> 01:06:51,320
Reckon we'll be home for spring planting?

722
01:06:55,995 --> 01:06:58,020
Just listen to them birds.

723
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:10,468
They don't take no time
to tune up and start singing.

724
01:07:10,543 --> 01:07:13,011
Soon as the shooting stops
and the smoke clears...

725
01:07:13,079 --> 01:07:15,070
they're right back at it.

726
01:07:19,885 --> 01:07:22,285
<i>So it came to pass, that as he trudged...</i>

727
01:07:22,354 --> 01:07:24,584
<i>from the place of blood and wrath...</i>

728
01:07:24,657 --> 01:07:26,284
<i>his soul changed.</i>

729
01:07:26,525 --> 01:07:29,221
<i>He had been to touch the great death...</i>

730
01:07:29,862 --> 01:07:33,730
<i>and found that after all,
it was but the great death.</i>

731
01:07:34,734 --> 01:07:36,759
<i>Scars faded as flowers...</i>

732
01:07:37,503 --> 01:07:40,939
<i>and the youth saw that the worid
was a worid for him.</i>

733
01:07:41,807 --> 01:07:45,004
<i>He had rid himself
of the red sickness of battle.</i>

734
01:07:45,444 --> 01:07:48,072
<i>The sultry nightmare was in the past.</i>

735
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:51,677
<i>He turned now, with a lover's thirst...</i>

736
01:07:52,017 --> 01:07:54,247
<i>to images of tranquil skies...</i>

737
01:07:54,453 --> 01:07:57,013
<i>fresh meadows, cool brooks.</i>

738
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:01,050
<i>An existence of soft and eternal peace.</i>

739
01:08:53,546 --> 01:08:55,571
English
