-Stop!
-Don't tell me what to do.

609
00:44:56,735 --> 00:44:58,736
-I'm giving orders.
-I don't like pushing.

610
00:44:58,904 --> 00:45:00,947
Give it to him, Pose! Come on!

611
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,615
POSEY:
I don't like to be shoved.

612
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,120
Stop pushing!

613
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:17,714
Posey. Posey!

614
00:45:20,676 --> 00:45:22,427
-Posey.
-Yes, sir?

615
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,387
Are you all right?

616
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:27,223
Yeah.

617
00:45:28,016 --> 00:45:29,559
All right, now. Relax.

618
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:32,520
Come on, get up.

619
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,777
You know, you learn how to take care
of that temper of yours...

620
00:45:39,945 --> 00:45:42,447
...ain't nobody gonna take
this knife away from you.

621
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,948
You're right. I'm sorry.

622
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:46,242
Okay, major. We're all set.

623
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,620
All right, you go in
and see Captain Kinder.

624
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:52,790
-What's he gonna do?
-He's just gonna talk to you, Posey.

625
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,544
-Brush yourself off and go on in.
-Yes, sir.

626
00:45:59,047 --> 00:46:01,591
REISMAN: All right, which
of you gentlemen is next?

627
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,135
Come on. I'm looking for a volunteer.

628
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:08,347
REISMAN:
All right, Maggott. You're next.

629
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,643
JEFFERSON: Speed it up, men.
Come on, speed it up.

630
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,775
They're looking good.

631
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:21,611
I hope they don't forget
what they're getting in shape for.

632
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,654
-Yeah.
POSEY: Major?

633
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:29,619
Captain Kinder figures
maybe he can teach me letters.

634
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,079
Folks back home would be proud
if I could write.

635
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:35,792
Well, that would put you way ahead
of most of the guys around here.

636
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:38,961
-Better fall in and join them.
-Yes, sir.

637
00:46:39,379 --> 00:46:41,839
It's true that I've been blessed...

638
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:45,343
...with an insight into women
that others don't have.

639
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:49,806
And sometimes...
Well, sometimes I'm called upon...

640
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,099
...to use it in our beloved master's will.

641
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:56,312
If women are your special province, why
do you hate Major Reisman so much?

642
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:02,485
There are 1 1 evil men out there...

643
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,320
...and...

644
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,698
...and they must be punished
for their wickedness.

645
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:10,326
And this Major Reisman,
he just snatched them up...

646
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:14,247
...from the brink of the pit, and he
cheated the master of his vengeance.

647
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:17,333
And you think that's what God wants?
To punish these men?

648
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:22,380
Oh, he will, captain. He will.
And Major Reisman too.

649
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:25,675
-So, what does that give you?
-It doesn't give me anything.

650
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,511
But along with these other results,
it gives you...

651
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,723
...about the most twisted, anti-social
bunch of psychopathic deformities ever.

652
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:36,686
And the worst, the most dangerous
of the bunch is Maggott.

653
00:47:37,187 --> 00:47:41,524
You've got one religious maniac,
one malignant dwarf, two near-idiots...

654
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,943
And the rest, I don't even want
to think about.

655
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,529
Well, I can't think of a better way
to fight a war.

656
00:47:46,697 --> 00:47:50,324
Very funny. The results of these tests
point to the fact that each man...

657
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:55,371
... has a built-in resentment against
any kind of authority. Any kind.

658
00:47:56,039 --> 00:47:58,416
-Don't you?
-But this is different.

659
00:47:58,584 --> 00:48:01,586
These guys think the U.S. Army
is their enemy, not the Germans.

660
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,254
Well, they know the U.S. Army.

661
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:06,215
But the Krauts haven't done
anything to them yet.

662
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,884
Very sophisticated.

663
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:12,555
Well, at least they know the U.S. Army.

664
00:48:12,973 --> 00:48:16,058
You can twist it any way you want.
But the point is...

665
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:17,977
...you are their main enemy.

666
00:48:18,145 --> 00:48:20,855
And when the time comes,
you'll be the number one target.

667
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,566
Well, at least it gives them
something in common.

668
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:24,817
What do you mean?

669
00:48:25,027 --> 00:48:28,696
They've come a long way individually,
further than we have a right to expect.

670
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,907
But not as a unit. Not as a group.

671
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:34,076
They've gotta function as a team.
And that's what's lacking.

672
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,537
You think putting them
on guard duty will help?

673
00:48:36,705 --> 00:48:39,081
Well, it might give them
a sense of participation.

674
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:44,295
Why don't you let me weed out
the real morons? Especially Maggot.

675
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:48,591
I didn't pick these men, the Army did.
And I didn't pick the assignment either.

676
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:52,261
This is one time the Army's going
with a starting lineup all the way.

00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,472
-Including Maggott?
-Including Maggott.

You planning to save your mother?

Why don't you lay off?

Want me to show you
how to do it, huh?

All right.

That's what I tried to tell him.

I'm going to say a word,

...as fast as you can
with whatever comes to mind.

697

For instance, if I were to say
"happiness," you might say "children."

698
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:56,826
I wouldn't say that.

Well, that was just an example.

But if I said "ambition,"
what would you say?

I wouldn't say anything.
