1
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,648
All right?

2
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:16,429
- I want a word with you.
- All right, Victor. All right, doll.

3
00:01:18,735 --> 00:01:20,443
All right, doll.

4
00:01:20,529 --> 00:01:23,150
Oh, my,
that step's awful high.

5
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:31,035
- What are you having? - I'm going
to the Victoria to visit my sister.

6
00:01:31,121 --> 00:01:35,072
- You want a long ticket or a short one?
- I've only got 25 pence.

7
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:40,162
I think you'll be cheaper with a
long ticket. Stick your money in there.

8
00:01:40,798 --> 00:01:43,915
You hold onto that and take a walk
down to that first seat there. OK?

9
00:01:45,594 --> 00:01:47,634
Nice and steady now.

10
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:01,310
I'll get this nice inspector here
to roll it up nice and tight for you.

11
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:03,643
All right, Victor?

12
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:06,358
There you go.

13
00:02:06,447 --> 00:02:07,776
All right, pal.

14
00:02:07,865 --> 00:02:10,071
That seems correct.

15
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,697
I don't know.

16
00:02:16,124 --> 00:02:19,147
What the fuck's that?
I hope you're going to pay for that.

17
00:02:19,335 --> 00:02:21,374
I'll make it up later.

18
00:02:21,462 --> 00:02:23,501
- And what's this?
- What about it?

19
00:02:24,756 --> 00:02:29,917
McGurk. He's down the road and he's
after your blood. Just give me that poster.

20
00:02:30,012 --> 00:02:32,004
Be careful.
That's a work of art.

21
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:35,762
A work of art?
McGurk scratching his balls?

22
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:41,436
You've already got one suspension
under your belt, Picasso.

23
00:02:42,128 --> 00:02:43,209
You just watch yourself.

24
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:46,437
I don't know.
I'm trying to keep you in a job.

25
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:02,663
All right, pal.

26
00:03:03,439 --> 00:03:04,332
35, please.

27
00:03:38,494 --> 00:03:40,949
All right, Inspector McGurk.

28
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:53,208
Tickets, please.

29
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:56,838
Ticket, please.
Your ticket.

30
00:03:57,929 --> 00:04:00,087
I must see your ticket, please.

31
00:04:01,579 --> 00:04:03,216
You show me ticket.

32
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:07,015
- You have no money?
- No money, no ticket.

33
00:04:07,104 --> 00:04:11,232
No money. Look, it's an offence.
I can get the police here, you know.

34
00:04:11,316 --> 00:04:14,651
- You understand police?
- No.

35
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:17,358
There must be something
that you have...

36
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:20,200
- I have nothing.
- You have no identification?

37
00:04:20,617 --> 00:04:26,370
You're telling me you've got on the bus
with no money, no ticket, no identification?

38
00:04:26,456 --> 00:04:28,496
This is ridiculous.

39
00:04:28,584 --> 00:04:32,996
You must have some means of showing
me who you are, where you're...

40
00:04:33,275 --> 00:04:35,081
Shylock, it's only 45 pence.
Leave the lassie alone.

41
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,479
- No, no.
- You take it, doll.

42
00:04:38,092 --> 00:04:41,544
- No. I've got you this time, smartarse.
- Don't take it out on her.

43
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:45,338
- What's your name, Miss?
- She doesn't understand English.

44
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:48,466
- You listening? She doesn't understand.
- Get back to your cabin.

45
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:52,306
I'm not going to any fuck all cabin.
She doesn't understand.

46
00:04:52,752 --> 00:04:56,477
I'll ask you one more time. What is your
full name? Give me your full name.

47
00:04:57,236 --> 00:04:59,359
She can't even understand.

48
00:04:59,446 --> 00:05:04,072
I'm telling you. You've got nothing to do
with this. Just you get back in your cabin.

49
00:05:04,159 --> 00:05:06,068
Are you enjoying this?
Are you?

50
00:05:06,452 --> 00:05:07,944
If you don't get back...
You're in trouble, son.

51
00:05:08,956 --> 00:05:12,205
I'm in trouble?
I thought she was in trouble.

52
00:05:12,292 --> 00:05:15,209
- Are you going to throw us a laugh?
- You're in trouble.

53
00:05:15,837 --> 00:05:17,711
This is embarrassing.
These people know this.

54
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:20,746
- I think it's terrible.
- It is terrible, "hen".

55
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:22,728
Are you listening?
It's terrible.

56
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:26,481
- Just you get back in your cabin!
- It's only fucking 45 pence.

57
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:30,631
- You fucking miserable prick, you!
- Leave her alone.

58
00:05:31,101 --> 00:05:32,144
It's disgusting.

59
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:34,179
Hey, darling, come on.

60
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:36,891
Thank you.

61
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:42,029
- Hey, calm down.
- Open that fucking door!

62
00:05:42,113 --> 00:05:46,525
Please calm... Watch your language
in front of the passengers, Mr McGurk.

63
00:05:46,617 --> 00:05:49,868
Ho!
You fucking baldy bastard, you!

64
00:06:01,214 --> 00:06:02,380
- George.
- All right, Sammy boy.

65
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,214
What you been up to? He's waiting for you.
You going in like that?

66
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,299
- Fucking really.
- Catch a grip of yourself.

67
00:06:09,014 --> 00:06:13,260
- Just get a wee bit smartened up.
- Who the fuck are you? Coco Chanel?

68
00:06:13,351 --> 00:06:15,344
It'll be OK.
Thanks, Sammy.

69
00:06:15,437 --> 00:06:20,063
- What the fuck? Give us my...
- Hey! No smart answers, all right?

70
00:06:20,149 --> 00:06:23,981
- Sammy, come on.
- Keep the trap shut, George.

71
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:36,119
Come in.

72
00:06:42,003 --> 00:06:45,005
So the scratcher
got you at last.

73
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,210
"You big, constipated
miserable prick, you. "

74
00:06:49,094 --> 00:06:51,382
I don't remember
saying constipated.

75
00:06:51,909 --> 00:06:53,050
You don't want this job, do you?

76
00:06:54,015 --> 00:06:55,973
I need it.

77
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:58,182
Like a hole in the head,
you need it.

78
00:06:58,269 --> 00:07:02,349
Right, a week's suspension.
Next time you're out.

79
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:15,988
Why don't you give me
a shot on the motorbike?

80
00:07:16,078 --> 00:07:20,324
- I'm fixing it the noo.
- That's what you said the last time.

81
00:07:20,415 --> 00:07:23,037
I know, but it was
broke last Saturday.

82
00:07:23,127 --> 00:07:25,748
But you told me I should
come last Saturday.

83
00:07:25,837 --> 00:07:28,209
Once I've fixed it,
you can get on it.

84
00:07:45,648 --> 00:07:48,565
- How are you doing?
- George Lennox?

85
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,023
- I remember you on the bus.
- Yeah, hi.

86
00:07:51,112 --> 00:07:55,191
- How are you doing?
- Well, I got your address from the bus.

87
00:07:55,282 --> 00:07:58,485
And I just want
to say thank you.

88
00:07:58,577 --> 00:08:01,281
No, not at all.
It was a pleasure.

89
00:08:02,226 --> 00:08:04,827
- And did you lose your job?
- No. Short sabbatical we call it.

90
00:08:05,709 --> 00:08:09,409
- I'm very sorry.
- Don't worry about it. It's no problem.

91
00:08:09,775 --> 00:08:13,758
I brought... This is for you.
This is present for you.

92
00:08:14,967 --> 00:08:18,218
That's really nice of you.
Thank you very much.

93
00:08:18,304 --> 00:08:20,546
Better stick it in my pocket.

94
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,344
Thank you very much.
That's really nice of you.

95
00:08:24,185 --> 00:08:25,325
Listen, do you want
a wee cup of coffee?

96
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:28,890
- I can't. - I need to say
thank you for the present.

97
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:34,355
Please. Just two minutes. Yeah?
You make sure she stays here, right?

98
00:08:34,445 --> 00:08:37,445
You stay there. OK?

99
00:08:38,823 --> 00:08:39,843
What's your name?

100
00:08:55,506 --> 00:08:57,048
- Where'd she go?
- She ran away.

101
00:08:57,759 --> 00:08:59,835
I thought I told you
to look after her.

102
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:02,714
- She ran away up there.
- That way?

103
00:09:03,055 --> 00:09:04,799
- Aye.
- You watch my stuff, OK?

104
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,180
See you later.

105
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,406
- Thanks very much.
- Keep the change.

106
00:09:29,497 --> 00:09:33,329
- Two coffees.
- Two coffees, OK. Sorted that.

107
00:09:33,417 --> 00:09:37,878
It's cold. Are you cold?
It's always cold here.

108
00:09:38,965 --> 00:09:41,965
Listen, erm... George.

109
00:09:43,052 --> 00:09:45,459
- Carla.
- Carla.

110
00:09:45,554 --> 00:09:48,258
- Very nice to meet you, Carla.
- You, too.

111
00:09:48,348 --> 00:09:50,591
So where is it you come from?

112
00:09:50,685 --> 00:09:53,934
Don't ask me question.
No question, please.

113
00:09:54,021 --> 00:09:56,060
- No questions?
- No.

114
00:09:56,148 --> 00:10:00,394
Fair enough, no questions.
It's a really nice name, Carla.

115
00:10:00,485 --> 00:10:02,726
Thank you.

116
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,526
- I don't suppose you've got a second name.
- I'm sorry, I have to go.

117
00:10:09,619 --> 00:10:12,406
No, you don't need to go.
Don't go.

118
00:10:12,747 --> 00:10:15,533
I'm sorry about your job.
I have to go.

119
00:10:15,874 --> 00:10:18,349
Why do you need to go?

120
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:21,452
I have to go.

121
00:10:22,173 --> 00:10:24,580
Carla, you give me
your phone number?

122
00:10:26,343 --> 00:10:29,509
Come on.
I'm amazing company, really.

123
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,636
I'll even let you drive my bus.

124
00:10:34,226 --> 00:10:37,096
9540119.

125
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:40,224
9540119.
I'll phone you.

126
00:11:08,946 --> 00:11:10,458
- You want the change, Sammy?
- Aye.

127
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:21,263
All right, girls?

128
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:40,454
What's up with yo u, man?
You've hardly said a word all night.

129
00:11:41,707 --> 00:11:44,791
- Nothing.
- Nothing, aye.

130
00:11:44,877 --> 00:11:47,747
- Come on, tell your Uncle Sam.
- Get off, Sam.

131
00:11:47,838 --> 00:11:50,922
Is it McGurk?
Is it something to do with the work?

132
00:11:52,009 --> 00:11:54,363
It's nothing to do
with the work, Sammy.

133
00:11:55,762 --> 00:11:58,467
You playing hard to
get with this man, eh?

134
00:11:58,556 --> 00:12:02,969
- What you saying to him?
- Tell him to shut up. He's nipping my head.

135
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,469
- Shut up.
- Nothing like a good night out!

136
00:12:05,564 --> 00:12:08,398
I would like to do one of
my favourite songs.

137
00:12:08,483 --> 00:12:12,017
Let's see all the couples on
the dance floor for Miss You Nights.

138
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:14,862
George, come on.
Come on, George.

139
00:12:19,368 --> 00:12:21,408
Is he steaming?

140
00:12:33,048 --> 00:12:36,915
Oh, listen, Rosemary can get us
a great discount with flowers.

141
00:12:37,010 --> 00:12:39,251
- Good, good.
- Aye.

142
00:12:39,345 --> 00:12:42,050
And I don't give a toss
about a fancy car.

143
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:44,381
Well, we'll not
get you one, then.

144
00:12:45,518 --> 00:12:47,558
Are you OK?

145
00:12:47,645 --> 00:12:49,519
Aye.

146
00:12:49,605 --> 00:12:51,598
Kiss me.

147
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:22,211
For fuck's sake, driver,
what's the matter?

148
00:13:22,586 --> 00:13:25,155
Give us a shot of that wheel.

149
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:28,172
For fuck's sake!

150
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:31,930
Come on, driver!
You're going the wrong way.

151
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:34,015
- God Almighty.
- Aye, right.

152
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,399
Will this be happening every second before
we get off at our stop? Fucking nut job...

153
00:14:56,811 --> 00:14:59,729
Thank you.
Thank you.

154
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:03,190
Thank you.
Thank you.

155
00:15:04,902 --> 00:15:08,686
Thank you.
Thank you.

156
00:15:08,781 --> 00:15:11,022
That was really good.

157
00:15:11,116 --> 00:15:13,156
Thank you.

158
00:15:16,831 --> 00:15:21,457
So how come you gave me the
bum telephone number, Carla?

159
00:15:23,128 --> 00:15:25,167
Sorry.
I'm going.

160
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:27,497
You keep running
away all the time.

161
00:15:28,592 --> 00:15:30,501
Carla?

162
00:15:42,188 --> 00:15:44,430
Fuck you, you again?

163
00:15:44,524 --> 00:15:46,765
Yeah.

164
00:15:48,068 --> 00:15:49,716
Carla, why did you give me
the bum telephone number?

165
00:15:49,945 --> 00:15:52,436
- Why did you ask me?
- Because I'm fucking concerned about you.

166
00:15:54,784 --> 00:15:57,571
Jesus Christ,
you don't live in here?

167
00:15:57,661 --> 00:16:00,662
- This is my home.
- It's a fucking terrible place.

168
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,790
Listen, you can't come in here, OK?
You can't.

169
00:16:04,542 --> 00:16:06,605
- OK, then.
- Go!

170
00:16:07,212 --> 00:16:09,288
- OK.
- Go now!

171
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:20,513
- Carla, Jesus Christ, this place is a dump.
- Stop following me.

172
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,300
I don't even know why
you're staying here.

173
00:16:24,395 --> 00:16:27,182
Just five minutes, darling,
and I'll be away.

174
00:16:27,273 --> 00:16:30,973
- Are you OK?
- Will you open this door?

175
00:16:31,068 --> 00:16:33,107
Carla.

176
00:16:33,195 --> 00:16:35,235
Who do you think you are?

177
00:16:35,322 --> 00:16:37,362
Talk to me.

178
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:40,450
Jesus, what a dump this is.

179
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:51,999
- You don't understand what get out means.
- Carla, calm down, it's OK.

180
00:16:52,088 --> 00:16:54,128
- Carla.
- Get out!

181
00:16:54,215 --> 00:16:57,915
- Carla, come here, come here.
- Get out. Get out. Get out.

182
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:01,095
It's OK.

183
00:17:02,182 --> 00:17:04,968
It's OK.
It's all right.

184
00:17:06,435 --> 00:17:08,475
I'm sorry.

185
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:15,523
Look, I'm sorry, I...

186
00:17:18,614 --> 00:17:21,187
What the hell's
going on in there?

187
00:17:23,201 --> 00:17:27,115
Open this door or I'm
gonna boot the fucker down.

188
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,494
- Who the hell are you?
- Spiritual advisor.

189
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:35,586
- Corporation supplying them nowadays?
- Very good.

190
00:17:35,671 --> 00:17:37,913
- Right, you, out.
- It's not her fault.

191
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:41,708
Out. You, too because
you knew the golden rule.

192
00:17:41,803 --> 00:17:45,717
- It's not her fault. I barged my way in.
- Barged your way in?

193
00:17:45,806 --> 00:17:47,964
Nobody,
but nobody barges past me.

194
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:50,300
You fucking listening
to what I'm saying?

195
00:17:50,394 --> 00:17:53,513
I want you two out in five minutes
or I'm phoning the police.

196
00:17:53,605 --> 00:17:55,729
- You're no' listening.
- Quiet!

197
00:17:55,816 --> 00:17:59,516
You've got four minutes now
and I'm phoning the police.

198
00:18:09,538 --> 00:18:13,202
Carla, look, you couldn't
stay here anyway, darling.

199
00:18:14,292 --> 00:18:18,206
Look, come with me.
I'll take you someplace better than this.

200
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:20,806
I've got a pal and
he's got a flat,

201
00:18:21,031 --> 00:18:23,959
and there's a room in his flat
and you can stay there.

202
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:28,256
It's a fucking huge flat and he's got a big
room and you can have that, no rent.

203
00:18:28,347 --> 00:18:30,588
I'll sort that out with Sammy.

204
00:18:30,682 --> 00:18:33,552
You don't have to pay
any rent or anything.

205
00:18:41,943 --> 00:18:44,564
Listen, it's a nice place, Carla,
you know?

206
00:18:45,571 --> 00:18:47,611
Much better than here.

207
00:18:48,492 --> 00:18:52,738
And we can go tonight.
Get you sorted out.

208
00:18:53,788 --> 00:18:55,247
OK.

209
00:18:55,331 --> 00:18:56,955
Aye, OK.

210
00:19:08,010 --> 00:19:10,417
Right, just go up the stairs.

211
00:19:10,512 --> 00:19:12,551
I hope Sammy's got milk.

212
00:19:22,357 --> 00:19:24,978
- All right, man.
- All right, Sammy.

213
00:19:25,068 --> 00:19:29,196
Er... Sammy, this is Carla.
Carla, Sammy.

214
00:19:30,323 --> 00:19:32,363
In you go.

215
00:19:34,952 --> 00:19:38,036
- What the fuck are you playing at?
- Not now.

216
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:44,499
Coast clear?

217
00:19:44,587 --> 00:19:47,208
- What do you mean?
- Empty.

218
00:19:47,298 --> 00:19:50,002
- Yeah.
- Good. Come on, Carla.

219
00:20:00,727 --> 00:20:05,139
- I tell you what, sack your cleaner.
- Just can't get the staff.

220
00:20:06,774 --> 00:20:10,274
Don't you worry, Carla.
We'll soon have this place tidied up.

221
00:20:10,362 --> 00:20:12,401
You sit there, darling.
Sit there.

222
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:16,363
Get this fire on, heat you up.

223
00:20:22,165 --> 00:20:24,240
I'll be back in a minute.

224
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,160
Come on.

225
00:20:31,506 --> 00:20:36,050
- That'll be breakfast for three, then, aye?
- Don't jump to conclusions.

226
00:20:36,136 --> 00:20:39,369
I'm not jumping to conclusions.
It's just...

227
00:20:39,872 --> 00:20:42,736
You're auditioning bridesmaids?

228
00:20:42,771 --> 00:20:46,342
Just thought you'd let the best man
have a wee say who's who.

229
00:20:46,437 --> 00:20:51,064
No, it's Maureen's pen
pal just flown in, aye?

230
00:20:52,151 --> 00:20:56,564
Who did she see? The groom to be,
number 72. There you are.

231
00:20:57,448 --> 00:21:00,073
Oh, far be it for me
to jump to any...

232
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:03,016
For fuck's sake, Sammy.
It's no' like that. Ok?

233
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,035
It's just...

234
00:21:07,082 --> 00:21:12,324
I don't know what the fuck it's about.
I'm just trying to help a lassie out.

235
00:21:12,420 --> 00:21:14,460
That's all right.

236
00:21:25,224 --> 00:21:27,466
There's some tea, Carla.

237
00:21:28,561 --> 00:21:30,601
Thank you.

238
00:21:30,688 --> 00:21:35,314
Listen, I had a word with Sammy and
you can stay here as long as you like.

239
00:21:35,401 --> 00:21:37,642
Sammy's a good man.

240
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:43,074
Nicaragua...
is where I come from.

241
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:46,408
Nicaragua?
Right.

242
00:21:48,914 --> 00:21:51,321
Did I hurt you?

243
00:21:51,416 --> 00:21:53,823
Did you hurt me?

244
00:21:53,918 --> 00:21:56,161
No, I've had a lot
worse than that.

245
00:21:56,255 --> 00:21:58,496
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure.

246
00:22:01,301 --> 00:22:02,711
Crazy guy.

247
00:22:05,888 --> 00:22:07,051
Crazy dancer.

248
00:22:23,093 --> 00:22:24,151
All right, doll.

249
00:22:34,457 --> 00:22:35,515
Fucking stupid...

250
00:22:40,713 --> 00:22:41,772
That's fucking clever, mate.

251
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:47,459
Did you see that there?
See the way he pulled in like that?

252
00:22:47,553 --> 00:22:50,341
- Are you blind?
- I had a fucking indicator on!

253
00:22:50,431 --> 00:22:53,136
Do you not use your mirrors?
I'm drivin' the fuckin' bus!

254
00:22:53,282 --> 00:22:55,013
You shouldn't pull into
a bus stop like that.

255
00:22:55,096 --> 00:22:57,217
Check your bloody mirrors!

256
00:22:57,252 --> 00:22:59,018
Why pull in?
The taxi's there.

257
00:22:59,106 --> 00:23:02,605
I was pulling in past the bus stop.
Do you not use your mirrors?

258
00:23:02,651 --> 00:23:06,359
I'm driving the fucking bus.
Passengers could be walking off there.

259
00:23:06,697 --> 00:23:09,650
- Never mind your passengers!
- Fucking sorry.

260
00:23:09,741 --> 00:23:12,991
I'm asking for a bit of
professional courtesy.

261
00:23:13,077 --> 00:23:17,325
- Passengers could walk in front.
- Never mind them. Look at my back light.

262
00:23:17,416 --> 00:23:21,116
- Away to fuck. You use your mirrors.
- Your punter's fucked off.

263
00:23:21,211 --> 00:23:23,452
You wee shite, get back here!

264
00:23:23,546 --> 00:23:27,330
- You're paying for my back light.
- Let's try and catch him up.

265
00:23:27,425 --> 00:23:30,046
Open this door!
Where are you going?

266
00:23:30,554 --> 00:23:32,445
- Let's just go for a wee run.
- Open this door!

267
00:23:32,848 --> 00:23:37,094
Get this door open! My money's in
that taxi! Open this door up!

268
00:23:37,748 --> 00:23:40,222
- We'll try and find him for you.
- Are you off your head?

269
00:23:40,605 --> 00:23:43,178
My money's in that fuckin' taxi!

270
00:23:43,942 --> 00:23:45,055
Calm down.
Calm down.

271
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:47,558
Shit.
My money's in that taxi!

272
00:23:49,405 --> 00:23:53,070
- Right, stop this bus right now!
- I'm taking you on a wee tour.

273
00:23:53,158 --> 00:23:55,566
Open this door!
I want off this bus right now.

274
00:23:56,286 --> 00:23:58,173
- A magical mystery tour.
- Open this fucking door!

275
00:23:58,581 --> 00:24:03,622
Look, I'll tell everybody it's my fault.
Just pull the fuckin' bus in, will you?

276
00:24:05,796 --> 00:24:08,037
- Want off?
- Aye, I want off.

277
00:24:12,886 --> 00:24:16,930
- Sure you want off?
- Aye, I want off. Now, open the doors!

278
00:24:17,015 --> 00:24:20,099
You want to see a doctor.
You're off your fuckin' head.

279
00:24:20,184 --> 00:24:22,224
Aye, so people tell me.

280
00:24:22,478 --> 00:24:23,996
What are you waiting for now?

281
00:24:25,648 --> 00:24:28,898
You need to all get off the bus.
It's out of service.

282
00:24:30,861 --> 00:24:32,339
I'm not joking.
You need to get off.

283
00:24:34,615 --> 00:24:36,509
- The guy's a pot head.
- We could have all been killed.

284
00:24:53,341 --> 00:24:55,334
Ho.

285
00:24:56,365 --> 00:24:58,670
- Ho! Off the bus.
- What's the bus doing here?

286
00:24:58,888 --> 00:25:00,927
Just fuck off.

287
00:25:01,015 --> 00:25:03,932
OK, OK.

288
00:25:04,018 --> 00:25:07,518
- Where are we going?
- Please don't ask me questions.

289
00:25:07,605 --> 00:25:10,226
- Why?
- No questions.

290
00:26:14,294 --> 00:26:16,452
"Better by bus. "

291
00:27:06,344 --> 00:27:08,585
There we are.

292
00:27:12,683 --> 00:27:14,722
- Eh?
- Beautiful.

293
00:27:14,810 --> 00:27:16,849
Yeah.

294
00:27:18,981 --> 00:27:22,063
This mountain over here
is called Ben Lomond.

295
00:27:22,818 --> 00:27:27,775
And this is Loch Lomond.
It goes on for miles and miles.

296
00:27:27,864 --> 00:27:30,319
- It's really beautiful.
- Yeah.

297
00:27:30,408 --> 00:27:32,650
I've been here hundreds of times.

298
00:27:33,536 --> 00:27:35,882
First I came here with my grandfather,
my grandpa.

299
00:27:37,290 --> 00:27:39,863
I was just a wee, wee boy.

300
00:27:40,522 --> 00:27:41,948
He loved it here.

301
00:27:42,836 --> 00:27:48,079
The thing I like about it is it's always
changing all the time, you know?

302
00:27:48,175 --> 00:27:53,252
The sky, the water, the ferns.

303
00:27:55,182 --> 00:27:58,846
I don't know. When I'm pissed off,
it makes me peaceful.

304
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:01,768
And then when I'm happy...

305
00:28:03,273 --> 00:28:06,523
it makes me more happy.
I don't know. I can't explain it.

306
00:28:08,611 --> 00:28:12,027
Anyway, let's have a seat.

307
00:28:17,954 --> 00:28:19,993
There we go.

308
00:28:22,124 --> 00:28:25,824
I've got a wee surprise.
You like surprises?

309
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,959
- Yes.
- Good.

310
00:28:30,507 --> 00:28:33,128
A special treat.

311
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,796
Da-da.

312
00:28:37,764 --> 00:28:39,804
- You like this?
- Yes.

313
00:28:39,892 --> 00:28:42,382
I love this.

314
00:28:43,311 --> 00:28:45,351
Get it off.

315
00:28:48,441 --> 00:28:50,268
Yes!

316
00:28:52,528 --> 00:28:54,355
Here.

317
00:28:58,701 --> 00:29:00,943
OK, toast.

318
00:29:01,036 --> 00:29:04,286
Make a toast and you're
bound to get good luck.

319
00:29:07,335 --> 00:29:11,035
To all my family,
to all my friends,

320
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:16,585
to all the world,
to the band I play with,

321
00:29:16,676 --> 00:29:20,377
to the music, to the drinks.

322
00:29:21,682 --> 00:29:23,721
That's lovely.

323
00:29:23,808 --> 00:29:27,509
And... to Antonio.

324
00:29:27,603 --> 00:29:29,643
Wherever he is.

325
00:29:32,191 --> 00:29:34,683
Your... boyfriend?

326
00:29:34,777 --> 00:29:37,185
He was.

327
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:41,941
And to Nicaragua libre.
Free Nicaragua.

328
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,281
Nicaragua libre.

329
00:29:46,789 --> 00:29:48,263
In a oner.
In a oner.

330
00:30:07,183 --> 00:30:09,222
Oh, fuck.

331
00:30:15,858 --> 00:30:19,025
Ya... fuckin' bastard.

332
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:34,705
Go on, you bastard!

333
00:30:39,255 --> 00:30:41,877
Fuck it.

334
00:30:42,071 --> 00:30:43,232
Fuck it, it's no' working.

335
00:30:45,762 --> 00:30:50,008
It's freezing. Come up the back.
It's warmer up here.

336
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:54,053
Oh, that's better.

337
00:30:54,145 --> 00:30:55,639
Oh!

338
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,981
Oh.

339
00:30:59,066 --> 00:31:03,811
Oh, your hands are cold.
Cold.

340
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:05,896
Yeah.

341
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,405
OK?

342
00:31:50,747 --> 00:31:53,444
It only happened a couple of times,
sweethart.

343
00:31:53,743 --> 00:31:56,151
And have you slept with her?

344
00:31:56,246 --> 00:31:57,953
No.

345
00:31:58,039 --> 00:32:00,078
Did you want to?

346
00:32:00,166 --> 00:32:02,408
For fuck's sake, Maureen.

347
00:32:02,502 --> 00:32:04,909
You've never ever
lied to me before.

348
00:32:06,631 --> 00:32:09,252
Probably. I don't know.
I hardly know her.

349
00:32:10,092 --> 00:32:12,131
What am I gonna do?

350
00:32:16,474 --> 00:32:19,178
Look, Maureen,
you're my best pal, but...

351
00:32:21,479 --> 00:32:24,100
I just don't want to marry you.

352
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,860
I tried to kid myself on.
I just can't do it.

353
00:32:32,573 --> 00:32:34,400
My God, you mean it.

354
00:32:34,492 --> 00:32:36,899
I wish I didn't but it's true.

355
00:32:36,994 --> 00:32:40,409
Maureen.
Maureen. Maureen.

356
00:32:40,497 --> 00:32:43,582
Maureen.

357
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:45,707
Come here, please.

358
00:33:11,277 --> 00:33:13,316
Carla?

359
00:33:33,423 --> 00:33:35,250
Carla?

360
00:33:44,517 --> 00:33:46,343
Carla?

361
00:34:22,053 --> 00:34:24,460
For God's sake.

362
00:34:24,555 --> 00:34:26,594
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

363
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,640
Fuck!

364
00:34:29,727 --> 00:34:32,183
God.
Fuck.

365
00:34:33,481 --> 00:34:35,936
Get up, for fuck's sake.

366
00:34:37,276 --> 00:34:39,067
Fuck!

367
00:34:39,152 --> 00:34:42,853
Oh, fucking Jesus fucking Christ.

368
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:45,653
Oh, Carla.

369
00:34:45,742 --> 00:34:47,984
Come on.

370
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:55,328
Shit.
Fucking shit.

371
00:35:19,274 --> 00:35:21,978
Excuse me.
How's the lassie?

372
00:35:22,068 --> 00:35:25,319
Well, erm, she's just been
seen by the consultant

373
00:35:25,405 --> 00:35:28,988
and... well, she's not responding
as well as we'd hoped,

374
00:35:29,075 --> 00:35:33,238
so we're just going to give her a
wee bit of help with her blood pressure.

375
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:37,114
So erm, it'll be an hour
or so before we know.

376
00:35:37,209 --> 00:35:39,000
Any chance I can sit in there?

377
00:35:39,085 --> 00:35:43,462
I'll check with the doctor. If you want
to take a seat and I'll get back to you.

378
00:35:43,547 --> 00:35:45,587
No problem.

379
00:35:53,307 --> 00:35:55,346
How's she doing?

380
00:35:55,434 --> 00:35:58,434
It's close.
Too close for comfort really.

381
00:35:59,083 --> 00:36:00,937
- Jesus Christ.
- She's been through a lot.

382
00:36:01,231 --> 00:36:03,639
Twice in six weeks is
more than most people...

383
00:36:03,734 --> 00:36:05,109
What?

384
00:36:05,194 --> 00:36:07,945
- I'm sorry. I thought you knew.
- Knew what?

385
00:36:08,029 --> 00:36:12,157
Well, she went through much
the same thing six weeks ago.

386
00:36:12,241 --> 00:36:14,862
I was on call at the time,
took her in.

387
00:36:14,952 --> 00:36:17,408
She's... I'm afraid to say.

388
00:36:18,415 --> 00:36:22,542
- I'm sorry. I'm going to have to dash.
- It's all right. Thanks a lot. Cheers.

389
00:36:26,839 --> 00:36:28,878
Fucking hell, Carla.

390
00:36:52,363 --> 00:36:56,990
"Carla's symptoms suggest
post-traumatic stress.. "

391
00:36:57,077 --> 00:36:59,994
"Dancer with group
in Nicaragua.. "

392
00:37:00,621 --> 00:37:03,643
"Said country in state of war.. "

393
00:37:06,377 --> 00:37:09,745
"Her group toured areas
of extreme danger.. "

394
00:37:09,838 --> 00:37:13,373
"Involved in some sort of
incident to do with that.. "

395
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:17,796
"Patient becomes confused on being
questioned about it and can't... "

396
00:37:17,888 --> 00:37:20,841
"won't give account of
what actually happened. "

397
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:23,100
Jesus.

398
00:37:23,936 --> 00:37:25,499
"Came to Europe seven
months ago with group.. "

399
00:37:26,146 --> 00:37:29,846
"intention to promote
support for cause. "

400
00:37:29,941 --> 00:37:33,606
"Stayed in UK when group
returned to Nicaragua. "

401
00:37:33,694 --> 00:37:37,645
"Joined up with Salvadorian refugees
in London for two months.. "

402
00:37:37,741 --> 00:37:39,780
"Chaotic existence.. "

403
00:37:40,764 --> 00:37:43,944
"Knew Glasgow only as
their first venue in UK.. "

404
00:37:45,539 --> 00:37:47,366
"No friends here. "

405
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:53,871
- I'm fucking sorry, Sammy.
- It's all right.

406
00:37:53,964 --> 00:37:57,214
- Is she all right?
- I don't know if she's... She's all right.

407
00:38:05,142 --> 00:38:08,391
There was a lot of letters
lying about the floor.

408
00:38:08,582 --> 00:38:12,145
- Where'd you put 'em?
- Hung 'em up in the kitchen to dry out.

409
00:38:12,815 --> 00:38:15,270
I'm just gonna take
this wee photo.

410
00:38:15,526 --> 00:38:18,191
I don't know what the fuck it is.
It means something to her, anyway.

411
00:38:30,665 --> 00:38:32,706
What'll we do with 'em?

412
00:38:33,794 --> 00:38:35,786
Don't know.

413
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,122
Get every one of them.

414
00:38:44,095 --> 00:38:46,717
These two look the best.

415
00:39:24,425 --> 00:39:26,465
Carla.

416
00:39:30,431 --> 00:39:32,258
Carla.

417
00:39:51,744 --> 00:39:54,910
- All right, darlin'?
- Fine, sweetheart. You?

418
00:39:55,289 --> 00:39:57,829
I'm OK to you.
How are you, Carla?

419
00:39:58,124 --> 00:40:00,995
- Bien.
- Bien. That's the three of us all right.

420
00:40:01,085 --> 00:40:03,790
- Come on. Up you come.
- You look lovely, Sammy.

421
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:08,589
Aye, so do you.
Real men wear pinnies, do you not know?

422
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:11,926
Good to see you, darlin'.
In you come. In you come.

423
00:40:12,013 --> 00:40:13,922
I'll whip that off
you later on.

424
00:40:14,014 --> 00:40:15,923
Hold on there.
Wait a minute.

425
00:40:16,016 --> 00:40:18,055
Just a wee minute.

426
00:40:20,688 --> 00:40:26,311
- Now is the time.
- Now is the time. Da-da!

427
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:33,071
It's beautiful.

428
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:35,777
Thank you.

429
00:40:35,869 --> 00:40:39,783
- It's nothing, darlin'.
- That's nice, Sammy boy.

430
00:40:39,873 --> 00:40:42,659
- You'd never do this for me.
- I'd do this for you.

431
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,493
- Would you fuck.
- I would.

432
00:40:44,585 --> 00:40:49,793
It's really beautiful...
but there is one mistake.

433
00:40:51,342 --> 00:40:55,042
This one is A, not O.

434
00:40:55,137 --> 00:40:57,924
- You fucked it up.
- I got a wee dictionary.

435
00:40:58,015 --> 00:41:02,760
Spanish-English dictionary. Oh, well,
you can't get the grammar in everything.

436
00:41:02,853 --> 00:41:04,810
- Thank you.
- Hey, ho, ho.

437
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:06,391
Ho, ho, ho, enough.

438
00:41:19,954 --> 00:41:23,654
No... no hands.

439
00:41:25,835 --> 00:41:27,874
Get out of that.

440
00:41:32,132 --> 00:41:34,171
Well done.

441
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:37,633
Come here.

442
00:41:39,389 --> 00:41:42,888
- Have to cheat a wee bit.
- No hands.

443
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,633
These tights are gonna be
a bit of a problem.

444
00:42:26,059 --> 00:42:28,680
Oh, fucking hell.

445
00:42:34,442 --> 00:42:37,692
My teeth are going to
go fuckin' flying out.

446
00:42:48,539 --> 00:42:50,780
- OK?
- Mm-hm.

447
00:42:50,874 --> 00:42:53,116
You need to kiss it better,
though.

448
00:43:01,718 --> 00:43:03,757
Stand up.

449
00:43:23,321 --> 00:43:25,195
Stand up.

450
00:43:26,199 --> 00:43:28,027
OK.

451
00:43:33,206 --> 00:43:35,993
Oh, no, no.
Fuck it, fuck it.

452
00:43:36,084 --> 00:43:38,954
Enough of that.
Come here.

453
00:44:00,941 --> 00:44:04,191
Fucking hell, Carla,
what happened to your back?

454
00:44:05,737 --> 00:44:08,145
I'm sorry.

455
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:12,284
Carla... Carla, I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.

456
00:44:12,369 --> 00:44:15,286
I'm sorry, darling, OK?
It's just a shock, OK?

457
00:44:15,371 --> 00:44:17,779
Just hold me.

458
00:44:26,007 --> 00:44:27,833
I'm sorry, Carla.

459
00:44:28,884 --> 00:44:30,711
I'm sorry, baby.

460
00:44:38,018 --> 00:44:43,012
Can... can you tell me
about the letters?

461
00:44:44,691 --> 00:44:47,098
- The letters?
- The letters.

462
00:44:48,195 --> 00:44:51,694
From Antonio...
Mi companero.

463
00:44:53,116 --> 00:44:55,820
He was... hurt.

464
00:44:57,161 --> 00:45:00,446
- Really hurt.
- He was hurt?

465
00:45:01,583 --> 00:45:03,908
Too hurt.
Too hurt.

466
00:45:04,002 --> 00:45:06,041
It's OK.
It's OK.

467
00:45:06,128 --> 00:45:08,168
Please don't cry.

468
00:45:09,214 --> 00:45:13,675
More than one letter,
I never opened them.

469
00:45:14,637 --> 00:45:17,482
After the day in
the mountain...

470
00:45:17,938 --> 00:45:21,122
I feel very strong.

471
00:45:21,831 --> 00:45:24,072
And I opened the letters.

472
00:45:25,897 --> 00:45:27,937
What did they say?

473
00:45:28,025 --> 00:45:31,274
Nothing.
And everything.

474
00:45:34,113 --> 00:45:36,900
I don't understand, darlin'.
What do you mean?

475
00:45:37,992 --> 00:45:40,068
Song.

476
00:45:40,598 --> 00:45:44,452
A simple song that
we wrote together,

477
00:45:44,487 --> 00:45:47,456
until the...
We just played.

478
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:50,211
What happened to him?

479
00:45:54,488 --> 00:45:56,704
Carla,
what happened to Antonio?

480
00:45:58,908 --> 00:46:01,115
Promise not to ask.

481
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:04,179
Not to ask.

482
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:09,559
- Promise me.
- OK, OK, I promise. I promise.

483
00:46:10,815 --> 00:46:13,223
On the life of your mother.

484
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,937
Say it.

485
00:46:17,134 --> 00:46:19,690
On the life of my mother,
I promise I'll never ask.

486
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,867
For you, to Nicaragua?

487
00:46:33,962 --> 00:46:35,457
For me.

488
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:42,167
- For me?
- For you.

489
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:50,060
Listen, you can't imagine
the situation at my home.

490
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:51,937
It's too dangerous for you.

491
00:46:53,314 --> 00:46:58,193
But listen, Carla, we can't keep running
away from this. We can't bury this.

492
00:46:59,069 --> 00:47:00,896
Am I right or am I wrong?

493
00:47:03,762 --> 00:47:06,110
- You are right.
- I scared you when I said that.

494
00:47:08,662 --> 00:47:12,157
But I don't know
where Antonio is.

495
00:47:12,833 --> 00:47:18,413
Carla, you have nightmares about this guy.
You dream about this guy.

496
00:47:19,172 --> 00:47:22,420
You don't know where he is,
whether he's hurt or he's alive,

497
00:47:22,547 --> 00:47:24,756
whether he's dead.

498
00:47:25,386 --> 00:47:27,426
We have to find him.

499
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,409
- This is my mum.
- Your mum?

500
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:54,907
Yes.

501
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:58,451
And this is my sister...

502
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:02,767
Lisa and Francisca.

503
00:48:02,802 --> 00:48:04,540
Goodness.

504
00:48:06,154 --> 00:48:07,717
- Who's that?
- Bradley.

505
00:48:08,636 --> 00:48:11,258
We'll find him the first.

506
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:14,846
- Before your family?
- Yes.

507
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:17,974
He'll help us find Antonio.

508
00:48:19,709 --> 00:48:20,789
So what does he do?

509
00:48:21,794 --> 00:48:25,482
Now he work for Acción Cristiana
Permanente por la Paz.

510
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:29,026
A US voluntary group.

511
00:48:29,114 --> 00:48:31,272
So he's a human
rights campaigner?

512
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,990
Yes.

513
00:48:35,703 --> 00:48:37,546
Who's that?

514
00:48:38,624 --> 00:48:40,331
Antonio.

515
00:49:18,662 --> 00:49:21,069
Hey, Carla, any of these?

516
00:49:21,164 --> 00:49:23,203
No, we can't.

517
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:30,506
- Carla, I need a drink.
- No good for you.

518
00:49:30,590 --> 00:49:33,674
Carla, I need it.
I need it.

519
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,167
You want to live in
the toilet one week?

520
00:49:36,262 --> 00:49:38,503
- No.
- No good for you. Come on.

521
00:49:38,597 --> 00:49:40,839
Fuck it.
Yeah, yeah.

522
00:49:41,558 --> 00:49:42,924
George, come on.

523
00:49:48,336 --> 00:49:49,389
Carry on, carry on.

524
00:49:49,941 --> 00:49:52,776
Carry on.

525
00:49:53,736 --> 00:49:55,528
Come on!

526
00:50:19,804 --> 00:50:23,885
George! George,
do you have money?

527
00:50:23,975 --> 00:50:25,802
- Money?
- Yeah.

528
00:50:25,894 --> 00:50:28,847
You have ticket,
you have to pay.

529
00:50:29,543 --> 00:50:33,018
- I've no' got any money.
- No money, no ticket.

530
00:50:33,984 --> 00:50:36,689
- You've got the money.
- Yeah, I know.

531
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:40,318
Skip on for nothing.

532
00:51:02,386 --> 00:51:04,508
George?

533
00:51:07,079 --> 00:51:08,678
Let her see it.

534
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:15,141
Carla,
tell her she can keep it.

535
00:51:15,232 --> 00:51:17,688
This is for my family.

536
00:51:17,777 --> 00:51:20,019
The bag's too heavy anyway.

537
00:51:20,696 --> 00:51:22,523
You like it?

538
00:51:26,868 --> 00:51:28,695
Here.

539
00:51:38,713 --> 00:51:40,587
OK.

540
00:51:40,673 --> 00:51:42,381
Jesus.

541
00:51:47,013 --> 00:51:49,052
- Buenas.
- Buenos días..

542
00:51:58,107 --> 00:52:02,354
OK. We have good luck.
He is here.

543
00:52:02,444 --> 00:52:05,065
- Bradley?
- Yeah. We have to wait.

544
00:52:05,155 --> 00:52:07,147
OK.

545
00:52:09,033 --> 00:52:12,948
The delegation that we
have coming down now...

546
00:52:13,038 --> 00:52:14,865
- Sit.
- OK.

547
00:52:14,956 --> 00:52:18,954
From Vermont we have the March 8th
National Women's Delegation.

548
00:52:19,043 --> 00:52:22,708
They're bringing down a pattern
for this woman from Colorado.

549
00:52:22,797 --> 00:52:26,131
They need to decide where they're
going to go. Women's places.

550
00:52:26,342 --> 00:52:27,799
That's him there, isn't it?

551
00:52:28,344 --> 00:52:30,087
Mm-hm.
This is Bradley.

552
00:52:30,179 --> 00:52:33,429
They were there in '84 and want
to go back and visit a family.

553
00:52:33,515 --> 00:52:35,923
- Press coverage?
- No press coverage.

554
00:52:36,018 --> 00:52:40,347
I don't think there'll be any outcome.
It's Bradley's turn to pick up reports.

555
00:52:40,439 --> 00:52:43,060
Everybody needs to turn
your reports over to him.

556
00:52:43,150 --> 00:52:45,557
- Let me have them.
- Here's my report.

557
00:52:45,652 --> 00:52:48,107
- That's mine.
- That's mine.

558
00:52:49,906 --> 00:52:54,403
- Photographs?
- Yup. Watch out, this one's...

559
00:52:57,101 --> 00:52:59,615
- So, are you going to go through 'em?
- What's this?

560
00:52:59,832 --> 00:53:01,872
I don't know which one it is.

561
00:53:01,959 --> 00:53:05,210
Uh... "An eerie silence
hangs over the scene,

562
00:53:05,296 --> 00:53:08,546
as we view the charred remains
of the house and farm

563
00:53:08,633 --> 00:53:11,882
that was once the
Enrique Schmitt Cooperative.

564
00:53:11,969 --> 00:53:16,714
Vultures fly overhead. My eyes fill with
tears as I examine the burnt-out remnants

565
00:53:16,807 --> 00:53:18,847
of their humble homes. "

566
00:53:18,934 --> 00:53:23,477
Jesus, Laura, this is Witness For Peace,
not War And Peace.

567
00:53:24,356 --> 00:53:28,982
You know, Laura, we really need specific...
specific information.

568
00:53:29,068 --> 00:53:31,310
- It's there.
- No, it's not there.

569
00:53:31,404 --> 00:53:34,987
- Did you read the rest of it?
- Tomas? Where's his last name?

570
00:53:35,075 --> 00:53:38,657
All right, now I've read it.
His name isn't there. It's Tomas who?

571
00:53:38,745 --> 00:53:40,784
How many Contras...

572
00:53:40,872 --> 00:53:42,911
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

573
00:53:43,478 --> 00:53:49,167
Laura, we need time, date, location,
fatalities, civilian or otherwise.

574
00:54:03,977 --> 00:54:06,931
- You want drink?
- Is the beer OK?

575
00:54:07,022 --> 00:54:11,434
Yes, it's OK.
Victoria is really good.

576
00:54:11,609 --> 00:54:13,416
I could murder a pint.

577
00:54:18,449 --> 00:54:20,489
- Carla.
- Gracias.

578
00:54:20,576 --> 00:54:22,154
Thank you.

579
00:54:22,244 --> 00:54:25,495
- Have you seen people
from the Brigadista? - No.

580
00:54:25,582 --> 00:54:27,788
- Vicky, Santiago, Ramon?
- No.

581
00:54:27,875 --> 00:54:32,204
- Rafael? - Yeah, I hear
from Rafael now and then.

582
00:54:32,296 --> 00:54:35,996
The last I heard is he's up in Esteli,
being worked to death by Norma.

583
00:54:36,258 --> 00:54:37,768
Trying to get away from her.

584
00:54:39,261 --> 00:54:42,345
I'd talk to her if she'd
give you 30 seconds.

585
00:54:43,599 --> 00:54:47,643
Rafael, he teaches literacy,
you know?

586
00:54:47,727 --> 00:54:49,720
- Reading and writing?
- Yeah.

587
00:54:49,812 --> 00:54:54,933
People from the country, campesinos,
old people, young people. Well...

588
00:55:00,323 --> 00:55:01,982
Look.

589
00:55:02,074 --> 00:55:04,695
Here we'll find Norma.

590
00:55:04,785 --> 00:55:07,656
And here is where
my family live now.

591
00:55:07,747 --> 00:55:11,246
Who has to move
out from Estelí.

592
00:55:11,333 --> 00:55:13,160
How come?

593
00:55:13,252 --> 00:55:18,246
Well, this is where my sister
went after my brothers.

594
00:55:18,569 --> 00:55:20,645
They killed one.
Mauricio.

595
00:55:21,593 --> 00:55:26,006
This is Esperanza,
where they live.

596
00:55:26,097 --> 00:55:29,513
And here the
biggest Contra camp.

597
00:55:30,163 --> 00:55:31,494
Jesus, it's tricky.

598
00:55:33,813 --> 00:55:38,522
- Hey, do that. Yeah, that.
- What do you do?

599
00:55:38,609 --> 00:55:42,310
Hang on. That's your sphincter.
The muscles around your orifice.

600
00:55:42,404 --> 00:55:43,649
- Don't.
- Hang on.

601
00:55:44,385 --> 00:55:47,848
What was the last time you were
so scared, so fucking paralysed...

602
00:55:47,952 --> 00:55:51,367
- Shut up! Bradley!
- ... you were taken over by your asshole.

603
00:55:51,455 --> 00:55:54,160
Hence the reflexive
verb to shit oneself.

604
00:55:54,249 --> 00:55:57,784
- Tricky, very tricky.
- OK. Fair enough. I get it.

605
00:56:01,381 --> 00:56:04,501
Bradley,
have you seen Antonio?

606
00:56:04,593 --> 00:56:08,839
- No, I already told you. Don't ask
me again. - Fucking callous bastard.

607
00:56:08,930 --> 00:56:11,883
You're an ignoramus.
What the fuck are you doing here?

608
00:56:11,974 --> 00:56:14,382
- Fuck you, man.
- What was that?

609
00:56:14,477 --> 00:56:17,395
I said fuck you.
Is there a fucking problem?

610
00:56:17,480 --> 00:56:19,556
Bradley!

611
00:56:26,864 --> 00:56:31,547
I'm going up north tomorrow,
in case you're still here.

612
00:56:40,002 --> 00:56:41,452
Fucking wank.

613
00:56:46,841 --> 00:56:51,467
- Forget him. He's an old friend.
- He's a fucking headcase.

614
00:56:55,808 --> 00:57:01,051
Listen,
we'll find Norma and Rafael.

615
00:57:01,147 --> 00:57:03,637
They know where Antonio is.

616
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:21,997
Uh, he say, what do you
grow in your country?

617
00:57:22,084 --> 00:57:25,001
- What do I grow?
- Yes.

618
00:57:25,837 --> 00:57:27,712
Er... nothing.

619
00:57:29,298 --> 00:57:31,338
Any corn?

620
00:57:31,425 --> 00:57:33,668
No.

621
00:57:35,889 --> 00:57:37,680
Any beans?

622
00:57:37,765 --> 00:57:39,140
No.

623
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:41,121
Melons?

624
00:57:41,977 --> 00:57:44,729
No melons either.

625
00:57:44,813 --> 00:57:47,731
I've got something, actually.

626
00:57:47,817 --> 00:57:50,058
Tell him.

627
00:57:50,152 --> 00:57:52,524
We grow...
It takes a long time to grow.

628
00:57:52,613 --> 00:57:55,483
It takes ten years to grow.

629
00:57:57,325 --> 00:57:59,567
In a bottle.

630
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,903
Whisky.

631
00:58:04,457 --> 00:58:06,284
Try it.

632
00:58:12,006 --> 00:58:16,798
He say, "What a fucking
wonderful country. "

633
00:58:16,886 --> 00:58:19,555
A fucking wonderful country.

634
00:58:39,094 --> 00:58:40,826
Refreshments!

635
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:44,058
Wait 10 minutes, please!

636
00:58:51,293 --> 00:58:54,380
We run a co-operative.
Show your friend.

637
00:58:55,777 --> 00:58:57,300
He'll see how title
deeds work here.

638
00:58:59,927 --> 00:59:04,174
He want that you see
these deeds for the land.

639
00:59:04,265 --> 00:59:05,973
- Deeds for the land?
- Yes.

640
00:59:06,767 --> 00:59:08,268
How did he get the land?

641
00:59:13,399 --> 00:59:16,269
The revolution gave the people
from the country...

642
00:59:24,076 --> 00:59:29,450
500 acres of land.
Now there are 40 families there.

643
00:59:35,462 --> 00:59:38,961
And he say that before
this is only for one man

644
00:59:39,049 --> 00:59:40,840
and now it's for 40 men.

645
00:59:40,925 --> 00:59:44,709
- One rich bastard owned the whole thing?
- Yes, 500 only for one people.

646
00:59:44,804 --> 00:59:49,051
Yes and now 40
families lives and...

647
00:59:49,142 --> 00:59:51,847
- So 500 for one before,
500 for 40 now. - Yes.

648
00:59:51,936 --> 00:59:55,720
What happens if the rich bastard
comes back? The one guy.

649
00:59:57,775 --> 01:00:00,391
If the owner comes back,
we're all united.

650
01:00:00,485 --> 01:00:04,562
We'll fight him with rifles
and we'll beat him off again.

651
01:00:05,032 --> 01:00:08,282
I think I know what he's saying.
Tell him to fuck off.

652
01:00:10,349 --> 01:00:14,537
- Yes, he can fuck off!
- Free country or death!

653
01:00:22,465 --> 01:00:25,357
And she... say that...

654
01:00:25,466 --> 01:00:28,982
now everybody's
happy because...

655
01:00:29,139 --> 01:00:31,756
because everybody...

656
01:00:32,011 --> 01:00:34,643
the companero...

657
01:00:35,227 --> 01:00:39,355
give the sangre,
give the blood for the revolution

658
01:00:39,439 --> 01:00:43,023
and now everybody
is in this revolution.

659
01:00:44,278 --> 01:00:48,524
We'll resist because it's our revolution
and nobody can take it away from us.

660
01:00:54,078 --> 01:00:58,326
And the revolution is new
and we defend the revolution.

661
01:00:58,417 --> 01:01:00,644
And anybody...

662
01:01:00,908 --> 01:01:03,620
come back
to Nicaragua...

663
01:01:05,715 --> 01:01:10,958
Now everybody's free
and the people from the USA,

664
01:01:11,033 --> 01:01:12,939
you know, gringos,
don't come back here.

665
01:01:23,649 --> 01:01:28,357
And she say now everybody different,
this revolution,

666
01:01:28,445 --> 01:01:31,766
because this revolution
is for people,

667
01:01:31,923 --> 01:01:34,879
young people,
children, old people,

668
01:01:34,914 --> 01:01:39,261
and everybody can't
forget everybody,

669
01:01:39,426 --> 01:01:41,690
todos los companeros.

670
01:01:41,725 --> 01:01:46,042
All the companeros that give
the life for this revolution.

671
01:01:46,316 --> 01:01:47,814
And everybody together.

672
01:01:55,054 --> 01:01:56,845
Sorry.

673
01:01:56,930 --> 01:01:58,970
- Where's the bag?
- I don't know.

674
01:01:59,057 --> 01:02:02,058
- The big bag.
- Hey!

675
01:02:02,143 --> 01:02:06,094
Hey!
Hey!

676
01:02:06,190 --> 01:02:09,724
- George, where is my bag?
- It's only a few bottles of shampoo.

677
01:02:09,818 --> 01:02:12,439
- My presents.
- I know, but the bus is away.

678
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:17,524
You don't understand. This is people
living in the middle of the war.

679
01:02:17,617 --> 01:02:21,318
Give me my other bag.
You don't understand anything.

680
01:02:29,963 --> 01:02:32,584
- Not too bad, eh?
- No.

681
01:02:32,673 --> 01:02:35,294
Could be worse.

682
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:38,005
Seems all right.
Mm.

683
01:02:40,764 --> 01:02:42,804
So the lights have gone down.

684
01:02:43,809 --> 01:02:48,352
- What's happening?
- Don't worry. Happens all the time.

685
01:02:49,481 --> 01:02:52,398
Ach, well, who needs lights, eh?

686
01:02:52,483 --> 01:02:55,603
Nice wee comfy bed.
We can give that a wee test.

687
01:02:55,695 --> 01:02:58,400
A wee tryout.

688
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:01,194
- You're mad.
- Aye, it's OK, isn't it?

689
01:03:01,284 --> 01:03:03,075
Yes.

690
01:04:31,495 --> 01:04:33,535
Corre, Antonio.

691
01:05:15,204 --> 01:05:19,664
Asesinos, hijos de la gran puta!

692
01:05:30,969 --> 01:05:33,590
What's the matter?
It's OK.

693
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:35,921
It's OK.
It's OK.

694
01:05:47,526 --> 01:05:50,526
Combatant Ronald Lopez...

695
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,281
...fell in defence
of this country.

696
01:05:54,721 --> 01:05:59,077
His family and the Sandanista
National Liberation Front...

697
01:05:59,308 --> 01:06:01,683
...invite you to the
wake tonight...

698
01:06:03,166 --> 01:06:08,161
- How long have you known Norma?
- Well, we met three years ago.

699
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:14,043
She very strong. She work with women.
Very strong.

700
01:06:22,310 --> 01:06:25,725
- I ask is... is Norma here.
- OK.

701
01:06:32,945 --> 01:06:36,152
- Can you tell me if Norma is here?
- Yes, but she's in a meeting.

702
01:06:38,617 --> 01:06:41,024
- She's here.
- OK.

703
01:06:46,249 --> 01:06:48,657
- Norma.
- Carla.

704
01:07:20,782 --> 01:07:22,490
Me?

705
01:07:22,575 --> 01:07:24,781
Sí.

706
01:07:33,044 --> 01:07:35,083
All right.
For me?

707
01:07:35,546 --> 01:07:37,585
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

708
01:07:38,090 --> 01:07:42,005
Er... I'm George.
George, aye, aye.

709
01:07:42,094 --> 01:07:45,048
- Mi nombre es Carina.
- Carina. Carina.

710
01:07:45,139 --> 01:07:47,594
- Maricella.
- Maricella.

711
01:07:48,475 --> 01:07:49,992
- Jara.
- Jara. Nice names.

712
01:07:50,393 --> 01:07:52,221
- Soweta.
- Soweta.

713
01:07:52,313 --> 01:07:55,562
Mm. That's good, that.
Great. It's nice.

714
01:07:55,649 --> 01:07:58,769
- Novia? Girlfriend?
- Girlfriend?

715
01:08:00,342 --> 01:08:02,106
Er... tricky question.

716
01:08:02,364 --> 01:08:05,615
Erm... it's a long story.
Maybe, so kind of.

717
01:08:09,205 --> 01:08:11,530
Open to offers, you know.

718
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:14,136
- George.
- Companero there.

719
01:08:14,876 --> 01:08:17,367
- Ah.
- There you go.

720
01:08:18,839 --> 01:08:19,870
He's my friend.

721
01:08:20,090 --> 01:08:22,164
- He came with you?
- Yes, from Scotland.

722
01:08:22,259 --> 01:08:24,500
Bye. Bye. Bye.

723
01:08:25,678 --> 01:08:27,256
- Hi.
- Are you OK?

724
01:08:27,347 --> 01:08:30,431
- I'm fine.
- Norma, George. George, Norma.

725
01:08:30,579 --> 01:08:32,517
- Hi, Norma.
- Nice to meat you.

726
01:08:32,665 --> 01:08:34,185
Very nice to meat you, too.
Yes.

727
01:08:34,646 --> 01:08:38,061
- Do you like our place?
- Yeah, it's very friendly.

728
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:41,398
Many little friends,
but one big enemy.

729
01:08:41,485 --> 01:08:43,727
- You know.
- Yeah.

730
01:08:43,820 --> 01:08:45,861
So do you have
news of Antonio?

731
01:08:46,949 --> 01:08:48,823
I saw Antonio six months ago.

732
01:08:50,035 --> 01:08:53,036
Just before he left hospital.

733
01:08:53,121 --> 01:08:57,368
I've tried to make contact,
but it's difficult.

734
01:08:57,458 --> 01:08:58,834
I understand.

735
01:08:59,022 --> 01:09:03,318
- Rafael doesn't know where he is?
- No, yes, he might know.

736
01:09:03,611 --> 01:09:06,237
You can ask him,
he lives nearby.

737
01:09:07,218 --> 01:09:09,625
We could do whatever.

738
01:09:14,621 --> 01:09:17,029
Yeah, good idea.

739
01:09:18,270 --> 01:09:21,929
- What do you think?
- Yeah, I've got some new pals.

740
01:09:26,091 --> 01:09:29,228
A bus hit a mine... an ambush..

741
01:10:19,245 --> 01:10:21,653
I want you to go home, George.

742
01:10:26,753 --> 01:10:29,290
Do you mean that?

743
01:10:29,586 --> 01:10:31,592
I mean it.

744
01:10:31,902 --> 01:10:36,878
I want you to think about this,
and be honest with me.

745
01:10:39,723 --> 01:10:42,131
I'm not going to
leave you now, Carla.

746
01:10:43,789 --> 01:10:45,884
There are many
things to tell you.

747
01:10:50,234 --> 01:10:52,938
We'll see this
through together, OK?

748
01:10:53,361 --> 01:10:54,502
- Together?
- Together.

749
01:11:41,637 --> 01:11:43,716
Terrific! Great!
Keep going. That's it.

750
01:11:45,286 --> 01:11:47,626
What dou you think,
Don Tarnsito?

751
01:11:48,205 --> 01:11:48,981
Could be better.

752
01:11:51,333 --> 01:11:52,109
Your turn's coming.

753
01:11:53,001 --> 01:11:53,987
That's great, Dona Elisenda!

754
01:11:55,087 --> 01:11:57,214
Let's hear it for Dona Elisenda!

755
01:11:57,590 --> 01:11:59,300
She's the women's
representative.

756
01:12:00,092 --> 01:12:03,470
And now, let's see...
You! Don Purificacion.

757
01:12:04,575 --> 01:12:07,641
- My name's too long!
- No, come on, I'll help you.

758
01:12:08,121 --> 01:12:10,769
Like I did last time.
Step up!

759
01:12:11,874 --> 01:12:14,939
Let's write it on the board.

760
01:12:16,044 --> 01:12:18,067
Higher so we can all read it.

761
01:12:18,964 --> 01:12:20,152
- How do we start... "Puri"?
- With a "P".

762
01:12:21,154 --> 01:12:22,447
- With a "P", and then?
- "U"...

763
01:12:25,429 --> 01:12:27,660
"R"...

764
01:12:28,557 --> 01:12:29,745
- And then?
- "I".

765
01:12:35,856 --> 01:12:39,129
Now the "I"...
That's it. Terrific!

766
01:12:41,069 --> 01:12:43,300
Let's hear it for
Don Purificacion!

767
01:12:46,281 --> 01:12:48,514
Good, we'll stop there.

768
01:12:49,410 --> 01:12:51,641
You can go,
that'll be all for today.

769
01:12:53,581 --> 01:12:56,854
I'll see you all next...?
Thursday.

770
01:12:57,542 --> 01:13:03,111
Right. Thank you all for comming.
Don't forget: Thursday. Be on time, OK?

771
01:13:05,050 --> 01:13:07,281
Don't forget your notebooks.

772
01:13:09,220 --> 01:13:10,409
And don't be late.

773
01:13:18,083 --> 01:13:19,585
Hey, Skinny!
It's so great to see you.

774
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:22,712
- Where'd you vanish to?
- It's a long story.

775
01:13:23,296 --> 01:13:24,798
So good to see you again.

776
01:13:25,381 --> 01:13:27,926
Nice to see you working
with the peasants.

777
01:13:29,032 --> 01:13:31,054
- I stayed to teach.
- That's great.

778
01:13:31,429 --> 01:13:36,267
Any news of my family?
My mum, Itza, my brother...

779
01:13:37,372 --> 01:13:41,481
Itza's just fine.
Your mother's well, but sick with worry.

780
01:13:43,107 --> 01:13:45,130
- But they're all well?
- Yes.

781
01:13:45,714 --> 01:13:47,737
They're all in San Cristobal,
don't worry.

782
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:49,822
That's good.
And the others from the brigade?

783
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,992
- Vicky, Santiago...
- All working, as usual.

784
01:13:58,747 --> 01:14:00,249
And Antonio?

785
01:14:00,978 --> 01:14:04,419
- Hey, you got real skinny..
- Cut the "skinny" stuff. And Antonio?

786
01:14:07,547 --> 01:14:09,320
Forget that, Carla.

787
01:14:09,633 --> 01:14:12,761
Fuck! How can I forget?
What happened to Antonio?

788
01:14:14,324 --> 01:14:17,974
Don't know. Ask Bradley.
He may know more than me.

789
01:14:19,016 --> 01:14:21,101
You all give me the same shit!

790
01:14:21,936 --> 01:14:24,751
"Ask Rafael".
Rafael says "Ask Bradley".

791
01:14:25,794 --> 01:14:28,922
Where are they? My friends?
Or my so-called friends?

792
01:14:29,443 --> 01:14:31,528
- We're all with you.
- What is it, then?

793
01:14:32,049 --> 01:14:33,405
I want to know about Antonio.

794
01:14:34,656 --> 01:14:37,785
What's the mystery?
He's dead?

795
01:14:40,912 --> 01:14:42,998
He's alive, he's alive.

796
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,083
But he's not well.

797
01:14:46,125 --> 01:14:48,211
Where is he? What's he up to?
Who's he with?

798
01:14:49,254 --> 01:14:50,297
I saw him four months ago.

799
01:14:52,382 --> 01:14:55,510
He didn't want to know about us.
Not you or me or anyone.

800
01:14:57,595 --> 01:14:59,680
Just worry about your family.

801
01:15:00,723 --> 01:15:03,851
I'm going to see them,
but I must know how Antonio is.

802
01:15:04,894 --> 01:15:10,107
You'll see him later. Go to your mother.
They need you more.

803
01:15:17,406 --> 01:15:18,837
Nose...

804
01:15:19,266 --> 01:15:21,144
Smell... nose...

805
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:24,354
Mouth.

806
01:15:28,874 --> 01:15:32,003
"Hands up!
This is a stick-up!"

807
01:15:35,131 --> 01:15:37,216
Yul Brynner, Magnificent Seven.

808
01:15:38,259 --> 01:15:41,386
Yul Brynner? He's crazy!
The guy's crazy, he's lying!

809
01:15:43,473 --> 01:15:46,600
It's Paul Newman that said it
in Butch Cassidy.

810
01:15:47,726 --> 01:15:48,841
Butch Cassidy?

811
01:15:49,603 --> 01:15:52,803
Paul Newman said it,
not Yul Brynner.

812
01:15:53,440 --> 01:15:54,720
No.

813
01:15:54,816 --> 01:15:58,067
Yul Brynner said that.

814
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:00,777
Impossible!
I saw the movie.

815
01:16:01,177 --> 01:16:04,114
It was Paul Newman
in Butch Cassidy.

816
01:16:04,659 --> 01:16:06,698
He thinks I'm fucking crazy, man.

817
01:16:07,787 --> 01:16:09,827
Crazy, crazy!
Lies worse than a goat!

818
01:16:16,837 --> 01:16:19,210
- What does "corre, corre" mean?
- What?

819
01:16:19,923 --> 01:16:24,550
- "Corre, corre. "
- It means "run, run. " Why?

820
01:16:24,637 --> 01:16:26,464
Nothing.

821
01:16:30,767 --> 01:16:34,183
Fucking bastard.

822
01:16:56,251 --> 01:16:58,956
- It's OK. It's OK.
- No, no.

823
01:16:59,045 --> 01:17:01,287
Carla, come here.
It's OK. It's OK.

824
01:17:01,381 --> 01:17:04,086
No!

825
01:17:04,176 --> 01:17:05,800
Carla!

826
01:17:07,596 --> 01:17:10,845
- Jesus Christ.
- Carla! Carla! Carla!

827
01:17:10,932 --> 01:17:15,558
- For fuck's sake, man, what's happening?
- Carla, Carla, Carla, Carla.

828
01:17:19,565 --> 01:17:21,807
No!

829
01:17:24,778 --> 01:17:25,977
Can you give me a hand?

830
01:17:29,699 --> 01:17:32,950
- Bradley, is she OK, man?
- George, give me a hand, kid.

831
01:17:33,037 --> 01:17:34,946
Come on.

832
01:17:35,038 --> 01:17:37,161
- Come on.
- Got her, got her.

833
01:17:37,249 --> 01:17:40,036
- You got her?
- Yeah. Got her, got her.

834
01:17:41,127 --> 01:17:43,166
It's OK.
It's OK.

835
01:17:43,254 --> 01:17:46,505
It's OK. You're going to be OK.
You're going to be OK.

836
01:17:47,425 --> 01:17:49,465
You're going to be OK.

837
01:17:49,552 --> 01:17:52,802
No, she won't.
She won't fucking be OK.

838
01:18:59,515 --> 01:19:01,096
Why did you lie to me?

839
01:19:03,685 --> 01:19:05,268
You said you knew nothing
about Antonio.

840
01:19:09,629 --> 01:19:11,002
How is he?

841
01:19:11,629 --> 01:19:15,223
They killed... his brother.

842
01:19:15,565 --> 01:19:17,645
- José?
- No, no.

843
01:19:17,762 --> 01:19:20,386
He went over to the Contras.

844
01:19:21,655 --> 01:19:23,578
The kid brother, Pedro.

845
01:19:23,613 --> 01:19:24,517
- Pedro?
- Sí.

846
01:19:27,646 --> 01:19:30,878
Why'd you come back? Why?

847
01:19:32,860 --> 01:19:35,569
- Because of George.
- Shit!

848
01:19:37,760 --> 01:19:40,365
No, Bradley.
No, Bradley, he was right.

849
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,286
He saved my life.

850
01:19:44,329 --> 01:19:45,372
And I love him.

851
01:19:46,936 --> 01:19:47,978
And Antonio?

852
01:19:51,106 --> 01:19:52,149
I couldn't bear it any more.

853
01:19:53,191 --> 01:19:54,755
But I can't forget him.

854
01:19:55,276 --> 01:19:56,319
It's too much, Carla.

855
01:19:57,361 --> 01:20:00,490
I have to face up to my past!
So do you.

856
01:20:01,533 --> 01:20:04,661
Don't talk to me
about the past.

857
01:20:05,703 --> 01:20:08,831
Stop running away
and face up to it.

858
01:20:13,002 --> 01:20:14,045
Where's Antonio?

859
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:16,651
- Living with me.
- What?!

860
01:20:17,173 --> 01:20:19,779
He's living with me.
With me.

861
01:20:21,343 --> 01:20:24,471
- I'm going with you.
- No, never!

862
01:20:24,993 --> 01:20:27,078
- I must see Antonio, Bradley.
- No, never!

863
01:20:28,642 --> 01:20:33,334
I'll take you to your family.
And that's it. Nothing more!

864
01:22:25,942 --> 01:22:29,070
- What's going on?
- She's just praying.

865
01:22:29,591 --> 01:22:31,676
Move on.
Contras!

866
01:22:32,198 --> 01:22:33,761
- He's with you?
- Yes, he's with me.

867
01:22:34,283 --> 01:22:37,932
- Well, now move!
- Yes. Thanks, man.

868
01:22:48,880 --> 01:22:49,923
The petrol is leaking.

869
01:22:50,923 --> 01:22:52,964
Ah, shit.

870
01:22:53,844 --> 01:22:55,883
Piece of shit.

871
01:23:01,225 --> 01:23:03,264
Give us a look.

872
01:23:10,693 --> 01:23:12,519
Oh, Jesus Christ.

873
01:23:12,861 --> 01:23:13,904
Fuck.

874
01:23:14,321 --> 01:23:16,230
- Have you any soap?
- Soap?

875
01:23:16,323 --> 01:23:18,362
Aye, soap.

876
01:23:21,203 --> 01:23:22,533
Good.

877
01:23:28,751 --> 01:23:30,791
Ah, it's fucking pissing out.

878
01:23:30,878 --> 01:23:33,287
Ah, fuck.

879
01:23:33,382 --> 01:23:35,706
- Try starting her up.
- Yeah?

880
01:23:35,800 --> 01:23:37,840
Aye.

881
01:23:46,853 --> 01:23:48,892
How's that?

882
01:23:51,273 --> 01:23:53,313
Yes.

883
01:23:53,400 --> 01:23:55,642
Are you sure?

884
01:23:55,736 --> 01:23:57,693
Yeah, yeah, yes.

885
01:23:57,779 --> 01:24:01,480
Well, that's what a good university
education does for you.

886
01:24:29,602 --> 01:24:31,428
Hey!

887
01:25:08,764 --> 01:25:11,848
Hi!

888
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,907
George.

889
01:25:35,999 --> 01:25:37,825
Come on.

890
01:25:37,917 --> 01:25:39,708
My family...

891
01:26:48,068 --> 01:26:50,524
Carla?
Nice bird.

892
01:26:52,155 --> 01:26:53,982
Aye.
Aye.

893
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:57,779
- Mi nombre es Harry.
- Harry?

894
01:26:57,870 --> 01:26:59,494
Harry.

895
01:26:59,579 --> 01:27:03,826
Harry's a real... See, Glasgow.
It's a real Glasgow name.

896
01:27:03,917 --> 01:27:09,457
Aye. I tell you and you'll probably no'
understand this, but I fancy her. See her?

897
01:27:10,340 --> 01:27:13,652
I fancy her and, like,
she's got a big...

898
01:27:13,716 --> 01:27:17,564
mystery in her
head and her heart.

899
01:27:18,159 --> 01:27:23,179
I also wanted to tell you, I love your
T - shirt. Let's make a trade.

900
01:27:24,145 --> 01:27:28,391
What, you fancy her an' all?
Fuckin' no chance by the way, wee man.

901
01:27:29,358 --> 01:27:32,040
Let's swap T-shirts.
I really love yours.

902
01:27:32,485 --> 01:27:34,542
Take mine.
You take my Sandino T-shirt.

903
01:27:34,947 --> 01:27:37,307
You want this T-shirt?
You want my...

904
01:27:37,448 --> 01:27:40,466
Fucking no problem.
Take the T-shirt.

905
01:27:41,870 --> 01:27:44,657
You wear this with pride, son.

906
01:27:44,747 --> 01:27:47,618
- You give me this?
- Sí. Mi camiseta.

907
01:27:47,708 --> 01:27:50,959
I'll fuckin' wear that wi' pride,
I'm telling you. Sandino.

908
01:27:51,045 --> 01:27:53,287
Sandino.
I know Sandino.

909
01:28:07,770 --> 01:28:12,016
That's... oh, great.
Just watch.

910
01:29:48,282 --> 01:29:49,907
Fuck.

911
01:30:30,448 --> 01:30:32,156
Harry!

912
01:30:35,995 --> 01:30:37,559
George, no!
Come back!

913
01:32:17,425 --> 01:32:20,047
Listen, I'm erm...

914
01:32:20,553 --> 01:32:24,738
You wanted me to be honest
with you and erm...

915
01:32:31,272 --> 01:32:33,311
I have to go back.

916
01:32:35,964 --> 01:32:40,609
But I want you to come with me, you know,
and we can take the baby.

917
01:32:40,864 --> 01:32:42,173
The three of us can go back.
I don't care.

918
01:32:45,348 --> 01:32:46,345
Antonio's kid?

919
01:32:48,476 --> 01:32:49,472
Yes.

920
01:32:52,041 --> 01:32:54,081
Do you know where he is?

921
01:32:56,545 --> 01:32:58,373
I do now.

922
01:32:59,466 --> 01:33:02,834
He live with Bradley
in Esperanza.

923
01:33:03,219 --> 01:33:05,649
Look, Carla,
I don't understand, you know.

924
01:33:10,017 --> 01:33:12,306
I don't understand.
I mean...

925
01:33:14,480 --> 01:33:16,581
Do you want to be with Antonio?
Do you love him?

926
01:33:17,608 --> 01:33:18,666
I don't know.

927
01:33:22,529 --> 01:33:24,569
I have to go back.

928
01:33:26,408 --> 01:33:30,505
I'm going to go to Estelí,
to the hostel.

929
01:33:31,096 --> 01:33:34,929
And I'll stay there
for one day. OK?

930
01:33:35,958 --> 01:33:38,210
I want you to
come because...

931
01:33:40,874 --> 01:33:43,668
I just can't take all
this killing, you know?

932
01:33:44,592 --> 01:33:46,631
It's fucking chaos.

933
01:34:16,914 --> 01:34:18,224
I wish the baby eas mine.

934
01:34:24,046 --> 01:34:26,085
George.

935
01:34:37,914 --> 01:34:40,057
Carla.
How are you?

936
01:34:43,128 --> 01:34:45,272
Did you tell him everything?

937
01:34:47,278 --> 01:34:48,327
No.

938
01:34:51,782 --> 01:34:55,658
- En media hora en Estelí.
- Later. To Estelí?

939
01:34:57,162 --> 01:34:59,570
George,
let me buy you a drink!

940
01:34:59,665 --> 01:35:01,492
I don't want fuck
all off of you.

941
01:35:01,583 --> 01:35:04,952
Come on, my Jeep's busted.
I'm stuck here and we need to talk.

942
01:35:05,045 --> 01:35:07,749
- Why the fuck did you lie about Antonio?
- Come on!

943
01:35:07,839 --> 01:35:11,539
- You fucking lied to me.
- Please, just come on.

944
01:35:28,984 --> 01:35:32,393
So what am I gonna get this time,
Goldilocks and the three fucking bears?

945
01:35:38,034 --> 01:35:40,656
Come on.
Why can't you just tell me the truth?

946
01:35:40,746 --> 01:35:44,114
- Say when.
- When, when. Tell me the truth.

947
01:35:44,398 --> 01:35:46,882
Ok.
Plain and simple.

948
01:35:47,253 --> 01:35:50,660
They caught Antonio in an ambush,
tied his hands behind his back

949
01:35:50,695 --> 01:35:52,331
and cut out his tongue
with a knife.

950
01:35:52,424 --> 01:35:57,418
And then when he was lying there,
they smashed his spine with rifle butts.

951
01:35:57,512 --> 01:35:59,551
Plain and simple.

952
01:36:00,723 --> 01:36:03,130
- Fuckin' animals.
- Animals, no, no.

953
01:36:03,225 --> 01:36:07,555
They're all fuckin' animals. The ones that
came here last night are fuckin' scum.

954
01:36:07,647 --> 01:36:10,731
Do you think they make this up
as they go along? Kid, grow up.

955
01:36:10,816 --> 01:36:12,855
It all came out from Langley.

956
01:36:12,943 --> 01:36:16,312
It was worked out ahead of time
from Langley fuckin' Virginia.

957
01:36:16,404 --> 01:36:19,738
Know where that is?
It's the headquarters for the CIA.

958
01:36:19,825 --> 01:36:24,451
Central Intelligence Agency. American.
Jesus Christ, look at this.

959
01:36:24,537 --> 01:36:28,321
- The fuckin' Nicaraguans came last night.
- Kid, that's right.

960
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:31,037
One of those Contras
had this in his pocket.

961
01:36:31,335 --> 01:36:33,749
You tell me how he got this.
A satellite photo.

962
01:36:34,464 --> 01:36:39,090
Taken by US planes. All right, look at this.
School, school, school.

963
01:36:39,176 --> 01:36:42,462
That is, I think,
a healthcare centre for sure.

964
01:36:42,554 --> 01:36:44,796
That's a farm co-op, OK.

965
01:36:44,890 --> 01:36:49,517
Now, wait a minute. Now, these are
attack plans those fucks had for last night.

966
01:36:49,603 --> 01:36:51,596
They're right here, OK?

967
01:36:51,688 --> 01:36:53,515
This is here, all right?

968
01:36:54,399 --> 01:36:57,649
They came in here right over
there between those sandbags.

969
01:36:58,361 --> 01:37:00,673
These are the two targets.
Shit, you don't need to look at this.

970
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:04,111
It's right in front of you,
what's left of the school,

971
01:37:04,377 --> 01:37:07,098
what's left of the
healthcare centre.

972
01:37:07,133 --> 01:37:08,784
Military targets...

973
01:37:10,665 --> 01:37:13,666
The CIA, kid,
runs this whole show.

974
01:37:14,315 --> 01:37:15,647
They run the whole
fuckin' thing.

975
01:37:15,837 --> 01:37:19,585
There is no Contras,
there is no war without 'em.

976
01:37:19,673 --> 01:37:23,920
You tell me what happened to Carla.
Did they rape her?

977
01:37:24,011 --> 01:37:26,050
- No.
- Did they?

978
01:37:26,137 --> 01:37:28,261
No.

979
01:37:29,058 --> 01:37:31,912
When he was lying there...

980
01:37:32,057 --> 01:37:35,659
paralysed and choking on
what was left of his tongue...

981
01:37:35,694 --> 01:37:37,768
We're talking about Antonio, OK?

982
01:37:38,274 --> 01:37:40,896
They poured acid
all over his face.

983
01:37:41,153 --> 01:37:43,857
- Oh, Jesus.
- George, George, George, George.

984
01:37:43,947 --> 01:37:45,986
George, listen to me.

985
01:37:48,076 --> 01:37:51,444
You know who watched
all of this, don't you?

986
01:37:51,537 --> 01:37:54,823
Oh, fuck.
God.

987
01:37:55,187 --> 01:37:58,159
Oh, Jesus, fuck.

988
01:38:15,935 --> 01:38:17,975
Is, er, Carla...?

989
01:38:19,063 --> 01:38:21,833
Carla's left for Esperanza,
to see Antonio.

990
01:38:22,088 --> 01:38:24,231
Carla?
She's here?

991
01:38:25,215 --> 01:38:28,402
I was surprised to see you,
I thought you'd left already.

992
01:38:30,282 --> 01:38:32,489
- Fuck, she's no' here, Carla?
- She's gone.

993
01:38:33,661 --> 01:38:35,488
- Antonio?
- Antonio.

994
01:38:35,580 --> 01:38:37,288
Oh, shit.

995
01:38:37,290 --> 01:38:39,658
Anyway,
she left a letter for you.

996
01:38:40,209 --> 01:38:42,616
- Carla?
- Sí. In case you come back.

997
01:38:42,711 --> 01:38:45,712
OK.
OK.

998
01:38:47,383 --> 01:38:48,877
Oh, shit.

999
01:38:49,259 --> 01:38:54,090
I'm really sorry about what
happened between you two...

1000
01:38:54,139 --> 01:38:58,385
She's not right. She's no' well.
I need to find her. Thank you.

1001
01:38:58,622 --> 01:39:00,680
I hope it all goes well for you.

1002
01:39:05,817 --> 01:39:08,058
Hey, Bradley!
Bradley!

1003
01:39:09,153 --> 01:39:12,403
You need to help me, man.
She's in Esperanza.

1004
01:39:12,489 --> 01:39:15,111
She's gonna fuckin'
do herself in.

1005
01:39:15,201 --> 01:39:18,652
- George, what is this?
- Carla went to Esperanza to see Antonio.

1006
01:39:18,746 --> 01:39:22,334
- She's gonna kill herself. I need
your Jeep. - It's busted. I told you.

1007
01:39:22,833 --> 01:39:24,493
Piss!

1008
01:39:24,584 --> 01:39:26,624
Fuckin' bus...

1009
01:39:27,755 --> 01:39:31,337
- Jesus.
- Hey, George! George!

1010
01:39:35,011 --> 01:39:38,711
George, what the fuck are you doing?
What are you doing?

1011
01:39:38,806 --> 01:39:40,847
Kid!
Hey, hold on!

1012
01:39:40,934 --> 01:39:42,973
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1013
01:39:47,815 --> 01:39:49,854
Come on, you fucker, move.

1014
01:40:30,439 --> 01:40:34,687
George, second house on the left. My place
is at the end, that's where Antonio is.

1015
01:40:34,777 --> 01:40:36,355
- OK.
- OK.

1016
01:41:03,430 --> 01:41:05,194
Hi.

1017
01:41:05,348 --> 01:41:07,174
Hi.

1018
01:41:19,153 --> 01:41:20,979
Are you OK?

1019
01:41:26,868 --> 01:41:29,276
Do you remember these?

1020
01:41:39,213 --> 01:41:44,208
"This song... is special to us.

1021
01:41:45,678 --> 01:41:49,592
Altogether ask what's that.

1022
01:41:52,601 --> 01:41:55,686
I touch him once.

1023
01:41:56,897 --> 01:41:58,937
Just once. "

1024
01:42:01,485 --> 01:42:03,311
OK.

1025
01:42:07,073 --> 01:42:08,901
Come on.

1026
01:43:04,504 --> 01:43:06,543
Come with me.

1027
01:43:07,631 --> 01:43:10,965
- Please.
- You have to go yourself.

1028
01:43:13,095 --> 01:43:15,134
Come on.

1029
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:58,551
Hey, wee man.
Perfecto-fucking-mente.

1030
01:46:59,813 --> 01:47:02,599
Uh, she wanted
you to have this.

1031
01:47:16,203 --> 01:47:17,746
Aye.

1032
01:47:18,748 --> 01:47:23,160
So er... what did you do?

1033
01:47:23,252 --> 01:47:28,957
CIA, Juticalpa, '81 to '84,
Honduras. You?

1034
01:47:29,924 --> 01:47:33,175
Bus driver, double-deckers,
number 72, Glasgow.

1035
01:47:37,807 --> 01:47:42,801
All this stuff, man,
it's hard to believe, eh?

1036
01:47:43,771 --> 01:47:45,811
Hard to believe, George.

1037
01:47:51,320 --> 01:47:54,404
Ah, parting gift.

1038
01:48:02,541 --> 01:48:04,392
Hey, Bradley.

1039
01:48:25,846 --> 01:48:31,286
