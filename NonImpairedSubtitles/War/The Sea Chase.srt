1
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:17,202
<i>I remember when it began,</i>
<i>and where:</i>

2
00:01:17,373 --> 00:01:19,489
<i>Sydney, Australia...</i>

3
00:01:19,653 --> 00:01:23,771
<i>... the day Hitler rejected our ultimatum</i>
<i>to stay out of Poland.</i>

4
00:01:24,373 --> 00:01:28,571
<i>I remember the ancient German freighter,</i>
<i>brooding at her moorings...</i>

5
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:32,248
<i>... coal bunkers and provision rooms</i>
<i>more than half empty...</i>

6
00:01:32,453 --> 00:01:36,241
<i>... with the unsafe waters of two oceans</i>
<i>between her and home.</i>

7
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:40,845
<i>It wasn 't as though her rusty carcass</i>
<i>was worth much...</i>

8
00:01:41,013 --> 00:01:43,083
<i>... or her men unexpendable.</i>

9
00:01:43,253 --> 00:01:46,211
<i>She was an old lady</i>
<i>of the ocean backstreets...</i>

10
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:49,888
<i>... who should have drowned herself</i>
<i>gracefully long before.</i>

11
00:01:50,053 --> 00:01:53,250
<i>So this is the story</i>
<i>of a German tramp steamer...</i>

12
00:01:53,413 --> 00:01:58,487
<i>... and a salute to a man for whom</i>
<i>the sea was a changeless way of life.</i>

13
00:01:58,653 --> 00:02:00,769
<i>The story of a ship and a man...</i>

14
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:03,322
<i>... who became so much</i>
<i>a part of one another...</i>

15
00:02:03,493 --> 00:02:05,290
<i>... that his heart was her power...</i>

16
00:02:05,453 --> 00:02:07,330
<i>... his breath, her life...</i>

17
00:02:07,493 --> 00:02:11,122
<i>... his stubbornness,</i>
<i>the steel of her sides.</i>

18
00:02:11,293 --> 00:02:14,285
<i>I am Jeff Napier,</i>
<i>and I knew them both...</i>

19
00:02:14,453 --> 00:02:17,490
<i>... back in the days before the world</i>
<i>took notice of them.</i>

20
00:02:17,653 --> 00:02:19,564
<i>Before there was a story.</i>

21
00:02:19,733 --> 00:02:23,442
<i>Her crew was of no credit</i>
<i>to any sea or land.</i>

22
00:02:23,613 --> 00:02:26,252
<i>Their captain realized that, of course.</i>

23
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,643
<i>In later years, I sometimes</i>
<i>blamed myself...</i>

24
00:02:28,813 --> 00:02:32,010
<i>... for making a challenge</i>
<i>of his problems.</i>

25
00:02:32,373 --> 00:02:36,048
<i>But then, I knew that wasn 't</i>
<i>the force that drove him.</i>

26
00:02:36,213 --> 00:02:38,932
<i>I knew it was something much deeper.</i>

27
00:02:39,093 --> 00:02:43,564
<i>Not loyalty, which is what one may owe</i>
<i>to others, but integrity.</i>

28
00:02:43,733 --> 00:02:45,928
<i>A man 's supreme obligation to himself.</i>

29
00:03:10,093 --> 00:03:14,723
<i>That was a recording of Berlin 's reaction</i>
<i>to Herr Hitler's defiant rejection of...</i>

30
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:17,088
Turn off that wireless!

31
00:03:21,733 --> 00:03:25,692
On the well deck! Get back to work!

32
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:31,569
- Jeff.
- Karl.

33
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:34,088
- Good to see you again.
- Good to see you too.

34
00:03:34,253 --> 00:03:36,562
Let's go up to my quarters.

35
00:03:37,213 --> 00:03:40,569
- Make yourself at home, Jeff.
- Thanks.

36
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:54,762
From the heavy cruiser <i>von Moltke</i>
to the tramp steamer <i>Ergenstrasse</i>.

37
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:57,886
How's your father?
I heard he was made vice admiral.

38
00:03:58,053 --> 00:03:59,691
Oh, he's as fit as a youngster.

39
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:01,650
Bellowing for a sea command.

40
00:04:01,813 --> 00:04:05,010
I'm afraid he's slated for a desk
at the admiralty this war.

41
00:04:05,173 --> 00:04:08,802
- And there's going to be war, Karl.
- There is.

42
00:04:09,053 --> 00:04:13,171
And I'm slated for internment,
is that what you're trying to say?

43
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,483
Well, that's one thing.

44
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:18,333
I see you still carry
the old imperial flag.

45
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:19,812
I do.

46
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:21,884
Quite different from the one astern.

47
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:25,250
You won't get an argument
out of me on that.

48
00:04:25,493 --> 00:04:28,291
Look, I'm Number One
of the <i>Rockhampton</i>.

49
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:31,684
We received orders this morning
to make ready to sail.

50
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:34,686
- On a war footing?
- Yes.

51
00:04:34,853 --> 00:04:37,321
Within the week,
we'll be fighting Nazism.

52
00:04:37,493 --> 00:04:41,850
Now, you've been fighting it since its
inception, and there are plenty like you.

53
00:04:42,293 --> 00:04:46,809
Karl, before this thing breaks,
why don't you establish yourself as...

54
00:04:47,013 --> 00:04:48,890
A traitor?

55
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:52,643
They took away my command.
Would you take away my homeland?

56
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:54,971
Sorry.

57
00:04:55,293 --> 00:04:58,126
Well, don't think
I haven't considered it.

58
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:02,603
But the <i>Rockhampton</i>,
a crack vessel of the Royal Navy...

59
00:05:02,773 --> 00:05:05,845
...certainly isn't wasting
its executive officer...

60
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:10,245
...to make a survey of the harmless old
<i>Ergenstrasse</i>, without cargo or coal...

61
00:05:10,773 --> 00:05:12,445
...unable to sail.

62
00:05:12,613 --> 00:05:14,490
No. It's Elsa.

63
00:05:14,893 --> 00:05:16,963
- Elsa who?
- Elsa Keller.

64
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:19,767
I met her in Hamburg.
She's waiting in the car.

65
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:22,811
- I'd like you to meet her, Karl.
- Gladly.

66
00:05:22,973 --> 00:05:26,443
Didn't I read sometime back
you were engaged to a girl in England?

67
00:05:27,093 --> 00:05:30,369
And I suppose there will be
the deuce to pay when I get back...

68
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:31,886
...but it'll have to be.

69
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:35,204
And this isn't just another girl
in Australia?

70
00:05:35,373 --> 00:05:36,647
I'm gonna marry her.

71
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:40,444
Let's don't keep her waiting.

72
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,368
I still keep something
for special occasions.

73
00:05:48,493 --> 00:05:50,882
Good. Don't bother
to come any further.

74
00:05:51,053 --> 00:05:52,486
Thank you.

75
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,803
You sent for me, sir?

76
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:58,808
Go over to our consulate fast.
Clear us for Yokohama just as we are.

77
00:05:58,973 --> 00:06:01,123
Yokohama?
We can't make Yokohama, sir.

78
00:06:01,293 --> 00:06:03,727
Go to our consulate.
Get into plain clothes.

79
00:06:03,893 --> 00:06:06,088
With news the way it is,
I want no brawls.

80
00:06:06,253 --> 00:06:08,084
Aye, aye, sir.

81
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,692
That's all right, Brounck. That's fine.

82
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:53,642
- Karl.
- Come in, come in.

83
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,371
Putting a chill on this.

84
00:06:55,533 --> 00:06:57,922
Elsa, this is Captain Karl Ehrlich.

85
00:06:58,093 --> 00:07:00,448
Karl, Miss Keller.

86
00:07:03,213 --> 00:07:04,965
Miss Keller.

87
00:07:06,413 --> 00:07:07,926
Haven't we met before?

88
00:07:08,613 --> 00:07:12,731
I can't quite recall, but the navy
seems to be mixed up in it somehow.

89
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:14,008
No.

90
00:07:14,213 --> 00:07:18,286
- He wouldn't have forgotten you.
- But I was in the navy.

91
00:07:19,493 --> 00:07:22,132
- Won't you sit down.
- Thank you.

92
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,524
I recall now.

93
00:07:25,773 --> 00:07:28,731
I was on the Riviera
when I heard the captain was...

94
00:07:28,893 --> 00:07:31,088
Relieved of his command.

95
00:07:31,253 --> 00:07:32,652
Yes.

96
00:07:32,813 --> 00:07:36,601
He spoke out quite boldly
against the new regime.

97
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:39,845
Until now, I didn't know
what happened to you, captain.

98
00:07:40,013 --> 00:07:41,366
They didn't shoot me.

99
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:47,091
You know, my friendship with Karl
is a family matter...

100
00:07:47,253 --> 00:07:48,971
...dating back a generation.

101
00:07:50,173 --> 00:07:54,007
- Champagne, or should I freshen this?
- No, that'll do fine, thanks.

102
00:07:55,093 --> 00:07:57,846
I have to report every four hours
to headquarters.

103
00:07:58,013 --> 00:08:00,447
- Is there a phone aboard?
- Not aboard the ship.

104
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,207
- There's one on the next wharf.
- That'll do fine.

105
00:08:03,373 --> 00:08:05,841
Do you mind if Elsa waits here
till I get back?

106
00:08:06,013 --> 00:08:09,005
- Delighted.
- Well, don't be too delighted.

107
00:08:09,173 --> 00:08:12,643
- I'll show you to the gangway.
- That's all right, I know the way.

108
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:28,646
It's as Jeff said.

109
00:08:28,813 --> 00:08:33,933
I've known him since he was a boy,
which he still is, in some ways.

110
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,885
I don't know your entire history,
but I know enough.

111
00:08:38,653 --> 00:08:39,927
So one of two things:

112
00:08:40,093 --> 00:08:44,928
When he returns, either you tell him in
front of me or I tell him in front of you.

113
00:08:45,413 --> 00:08:48,644
- Tell him what?
- About the Monte Carlo affair.

114
00:08:49,133 --> 00:08:53,729
Jack Cavanaugh never knew
any attractive woman slightly.

115
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:57,243
There was the famous, or infamous,
cruise with Billy Norton.

116
00:08:58,453 --> 00:09:03,686
Or the fact that Eric Carson shot himself
20 minutes before he was to marry you.

117
00:09:04,973 --> 00:09:06,247
Merely gossip, captain.

118
00:09:06,413 --> 00:09:09,849
Did you ever see a man
with his brains blown out?

119
00:09:11,013 --> 00:09:14,972
You don't come into this one way
or the other, except for plain meddling.

120
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:16,771
Keep out of it.

121
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:18,366
There's a third alternate.

122
00:09:18,533 --> 00:09:22,572
You can leave, never see Jeff again.
Just fade out with no explanation.

123
00:09:25,813 --> 00:09:27,405
I'm not going to forget this.

124
00:09:27,573 --> 00:09:30,246
No matter how long it takes,
I shall pay you back.

125
00:09:30,413 --> 00:09:31,766
You have nothing now...

126
00:09:31,933 --> 00:09:34,572
...but when I'm finished,
you won't even have this!

127
00:09:34,733 --> 00:09:36,803
To what I promise you!

128
00:09:57,133 --> 00:09:59,852
- Mr. Bachman.
- Yes, sir?

129
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,649
- What have you there?
- Explosives, sir.

130
00:10:02,813 --> 00:10:04,087
- Explosives?
- Yes, sir.

131
00:10:04,253 --> 00:10:06,084
Mr. Kirchner told me to plant them.

132
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:09,131
I was just coming to report.
They thought up a new one.

133
00:10:09,293 --> 00:10:13,002
Crews of foreign ships are to be
medically examined before a clearance.

134
00:10:13,173 --> 00:10:17,007
Our consul passed orders for us to
scuttle the minute we get news of war.

135
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:20,006
Take that stuff back
to the chief engineer.

136
00:10:20,173 --> 00:10:22,607
- And don't go by the gangway.
- Yes, sir.

137
00:10:22,773 --> 00:10:25,241
Get out of that shore gear,
get ready for sea.

138
00:10:25,413 --> 00:10:28,485
I believe you're aware of my status
in Naval Intelligence.

139
00:10:28,653 --> 00:10:32,646
I took the opportunity to ask the consul
to wireless home for further orders.

140
00:10:32,813 --> 00:10:35,008
Possibly to fly me home.

141
00:10:35,173 --> 00:10:38,961
Mr. Kirchner, we have not abandoned
this ship yet.

142
00:10:39,133 --> 00:10:40,566
- Stemme.
- Sir.

143
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,485
You will go to the consul at once.

144
00:10:42,653 --> 00:10:45,292
Pay him my respects
and inform him personally...

145
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:48,251
...that the weather forecast
for tonight is heavy fog.

146
00:10:48,413 --> 00:10:52,884
Tell him I'll attempt to get out of Sydney
harbor tonight on my own responsibility...

147
00:10:53,053 --> 00:10:56,090
...and shall so log it for his protection.
- Aye, aye, sir.

148
00:10:56,253 --> 00:10:58,403
- Hurry it up.
- Yes, sir.

149
00:10:58,573 --> 00:11:01,292
Your orders come through,
you'll be relieved of duty.

150
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:04,490
- Otherwise, you sail.
- We haven't a chance of getting out.

151
00:11:04,653 --> 00:11:08,851
- You'll have to scuttle.
- You're mistaken, Mr. Kirchner.

152
00:11:09,733 --> 00:11:13,043
That British officer
is in your quarters, sir.

153
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:23,932
Well. What happened?

154
00:11:24,613 --> 00:11:27,810
- A little accident.
- What sort of an accident?

155
00:11:27,973 --> 00:11:30,487
- Where's Elsa?
- She isn't here.

156
00:11:30,653 --> 00:11:35,568
- What do you mean, she isn't here?
- I'm sorry, Jeff, but I can't help you out.

157
00:11:35,733 --> 00:11:38,850
She just left and didn't say
where she was going.

158
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:43,131
- You mean to say she just walked off?
- You know women.

159
00:11:43,573 --> 00:11:46,133
What are you trying to tell me?

160
00:11:48,853 --> 00:11:51,890
I don't think she's gonna marry you.

161
00:11:52,653 --> 00:11:56,612
You didn't tell her anything to make her
change her mind, I suppose?

162
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:02,363
All right, I'll find out for myself.

163
00:12:02,533 --> 00:12:05,366
But if she's not at the hotel,
I'll be right back...

164
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:08,093
...because you'll be here
for the duration.

165
00:12:08,253 --> 00:12:10,483
Are you sure?

166
00:12:10,973 --> 00:12:13,328
Yes, I'm sure.

167
00:12:24,893 --> 00:12:26,565
Fog won't get much heavier now.

168
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:29,201
Where do you propose to take
your first bearing?

169
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,762
- Here, sir.
- We won't be able to see it.

170
00:12:31,933 --> 00:12:34,242
Perhaps we can hear it.

171
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:37,211
Five minutes to slack tide.
The men at their stations?

172
00:12:37,373 --> 00:12:40,206
Yes, sir. Standing by fore and aft.
Also in the waist.

173
00:12:54,893 --> 00:12:56,326
- Well?
- Charge has been set.

174
00:12:56,493 --> 00:13:00,964
- Where do you want the detonator?
- Put it near the telegraph.

175
00:13:05,013 --> 00:13:07,243
Cadet Stemme, are you still curious...

176
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:10,291
...about what happens to us
in case we're caught?

177
00:13:10,453 --> 00:13:12,523
- You make it clear.
- Go to your station.

178
00:13:12,693 --> 00:13:14,411
Yes, sir.

179
00:13:20,573 --> 00:13:22,564
- Bridge.
- Bridge.

180
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:24,052
All ready below.

181
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,972
Engine room reports
all ready below, sir.

182
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:29,445
Wesser.

183
00:14:19,613 --> 00:14:21,569
- It's a car, sir.
- Police?

184
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:23,803
Whoever it is, they're coming aboard.

185
00:14:23,973 --> 00:14:26,203
Get back out of sight.

186
00:14:58,973 --> 00:15:01,123
I must see the captain at once.

187
00:15:01,293 --> 00:15:04,205
- Urgent.
- All right, sir.

188
00:15:04,693 --> 00:15:08,049
Follow me. We'd better go up
on the other side.

189
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:12,049
It's the consul general, sir.

190
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:15,251
Our brilliant consulate service.
What does he...?

191
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:17,881
Get back to your station.

192
00:15:23,933 --> 00:15:26,208
Captain Ehrlich, sir. Gentlemen.

193
00:15:26,853 --> 00:15:29,970
As you know, I cannot condone
this mad venture, but if...

194
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:32,693
- What do you want, Mr. Consul?
- Consul general.

195
00:15:32,853 --> 00:15:34,332
Mr. Consul General.

196
00:15:34,493 --> 00:15:36,723
I have someone here
you must take with you.

197
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:39,453
I ask for coal and provisions
and get a passenger?

198
00:15:39,613 --> 00:15:42,571
Sir, this is official.

199
00:15:43,373 --> 00:15:45,967
Intelligence agent.
Must be out of the country...

200
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:48,328
...before the authorities make an arrest.

201
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:54,966
Cadet Wesser, bring the consul's...
The consul general's passenger aboard.

202
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:56,646
Yes, sir.

203
00:15:57,013 --> 00:15:59,891
And you, sir, unless you wish
to sail with us...

204
00:16:00,053 --> 00:16:01,645
...get yourself off this ship.

205
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:04,532
With pleasure. <i>Heil Hitler</i>.

206
00:16:15,613 --> 00:16:17,888
The gangway's aboard
and the springs are in.

207
00:16:18,053 --> 00:16:21,250
Make the signal
to let go the bowline.

208
00:16:30,013 --> 00:16:31,810
Let go aft.

209
00:16:37,733 --> 00:16:39,644
- Slow ahead.
- Slow ahead.

210
00:16:40,093 --> 00:16:41,367
Slow ahead.

211
00:16:41,573 --> 00:16:43,484
Slow ahead.

212
00:17:08,493 --> 00:17:10,290
<i>- Engine room.</i>
- Schmitt...

213
00:17:10,453 --> 00:17:15,083
...if we run aground or ram anything,
as is likely, let go with that charge.

214
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,325
- Ten degrees left.
- Ten degrees left, sir.

215
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:31,330
And hold her there.

216
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:38,206
<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>, Sydney.

217
00:18:00,933 --> 00:18:04,005
- Wesser, more coffee.
- Yes, sir.

218
00:18:05,093 --> 00:18:07,846
If you don't mind my saying so, sir...

219
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:12,092
...well, you've been on your feet
over 11 hours now...

220
00:18:12,253 --> 00:18:15,928
Are you suggesting that I go
to my quarters, Mr. Wesser?

221
00:18:16,093 --> 00:18:18,732
Well, yes, sir.

222
00:18:19,693 --> 00:18:21,888
Maybe you're right.

223
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:29,486
- Stemme.
- Sir?

224
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:32,964
That passenger, I'll see him now.
Show him to my quarters.

225
00:18:33,133 --> 00:18:34,805
She's in your quarters, sir.

226
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,289
She?

227
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:07,091
I had a premonition.

228
00:19:08,453 --> 00:19:11,570
Believe me, I don't want this
any more than you do.

229
00:19:12,093 --> 00:19:15,130
You certainly haven't lessened
my problems any.

230
00:19:15,293 --> 00:19:18,012
I don't know,
you might find me very useful.

231
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,972
The destroyer <i>Cressy</i> is north of you.

232
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:23,733
She left Brisbane late yesterday.

233
00:19:24,773 --> 00:19:28,402
And two days ago...
Do you mind giving me a light?

234
00:19:36,973 --> 00:19:39,646
- The destroyer <i>Eden</i>
left Melbourne on patrol.

235
00:19:39,813 --> 00:19:43,328
The <i>Rockhampton</i> has been on
maneuvers with the Australian squadron.

236
00:19:43,493 --> 00:19:46,849
Our friend Napier's
doubtless at sea again by this time.

237
00:19:47,013 --> 00:19:50,972
Our friend Napier has doubtlessly
been at sea for the last six months...

238
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:53,283
...or you wouldn't have
this information.

239
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:56,013
- Are you sure?
- Quite.

240
00:19:56,173 --> 00:19:58,767
I have to be, in my work.

241
00:19:59,133 --> 00:20:01,488
The <i>Eden</i> and <i>Cressy</i> are old ships.

242
00:20:01,653 --> 00:20:03,962
I wonder when they were
last overhauled.

243
00:20:04,133 --> 00:20:05,964
That I don't know.

244
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:08,524
You see, I didn't go in for details.

245
00:20:09,613 --> 00:20:11,569
No, I suppose not.

246
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:14,964
You were just in the business
of making men talk.

247
00:20:15,893 --> 00:20:17,451
And they usually did.

248
00:20:19,613 --> 00:20:23,083
But why marriage?
Wouldn't Jeff talk without it?

249
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:27,212
Or at this stage, did you want to add
a wedding ring to your trophies?

250
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:31,332
I had orders to acquire
British nationality by marriage...

251
00:20:31,493 --> 00:20:34,132
...preferably into a naval family.

252
00:20:35,173 --> 00:20:38,165
But I shall see that my failure
to comply is reported...

253
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,689
...completely, and with reasons.

254
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:44,931
So long as you had
to hurt Jeff so badly...

255
00:20:45,093 --> 00:20:48,529
...I'm sorry it was
cold-blooded duty with you.

256
00:20:50,493 --> 00:20:53,724
- Did you bring any baggage aboard?
- Only one case.

257
00:20:53,933 --> 00:20:57,892
If you need any extra clothing,
we can outfit you from the slop chest.

258
00:20:59,013 --> 00:21:01,083
Where do I sleep?

259
00:21:08,773 --> 00:21:10,604
Right in here.

260
00:21:10,773 --> 00:21:13,571
You'll find fresh bed linen in that closet.

261
00:21:13,733 --> 00:21:15,849
- Here's the bath...
- I found it.

262
00:21:16,013 --> 00:21:18,891
...which connects with
my sleeping quarters.

263
00:21:19,293 --> 00:21:23,684
- There's a lock on both sides of the door.
- I found that too.

264
00:21:23,853 --> 00:21:26,925
So we now share a wonderful bond:

265
00:21:27,093 --> 00:21:28,890
Mutual self-preservation.

266
00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:31,692
I don't want prison,
and you don't want internment.

267
00:21:31,893 --> 00:21:34,930
You'd have been lucky
to get away with a prison sentence...

268
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:39,644
...so I don't think you'll complain if you
find this ship slightly similar to a prison.

269
00:21:40,013 --> 00:21:41,810
Prison is only a state of mind.

270
00:21:42,733 --> 00:21:46,362
Well, I'm in a tired state of mind
right now.

271
00:21:54,253 --> 00:21:55,242
<i>Bridge.</i>

272
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:59,247
Have all officers report to the bridge
at the change of watch, and call me.

273
00:21:59,453 --> 00:22:01,171
<i>Aye, aye, sir.</i>

274
00:22:04,173 --> 00:22:06,767
And now, if you don't mind...

275
00:22:33,533 --> 00:22:36,411
Your invitation to the wardroom
is accepted, gentlemen.

276
00:22:36,573 --> 00:22:39,883
And I have not come empty-handed.
I have two signals here.

277
00:22:40,053 --> 00:22:43,284
Number one, we have
declared war on Germany.

278
00:22:43,453 --> 00:22:44,852
Finally.

279
00:22:45,013 --> 00:22:47,766
Number two, a German freighter,
the <i>Ergenstrasse</i>...

280
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:50,003
...slipped out of Sydney last night.

281
00:22:50,173 --> 00:22:54,007
Ours is the not-too-glorious task
of making a sweep and intercepting her.

282
00:22:54,173 --> 00:22:57,370
Sit down, gentlemen.
There goes your leave, Napier.

283
00:22:57,533 --> 00:22:59,922
- What will you have to drink?
- Beer, thank you.

284
00:23:00,093 --> 00:23:03,722
It'd seem they'd find us something
more important to do.

285
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:06,684
This is our position.

286
00:23:06,853 --> 00:23:11,165
One of the destroyers is somewhere
along this arc, about here.

287
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:14,052
I expect it to pass inshore of us.

288
00:23:14,213 --> 00:23:16,010
The other one is about here.

289
00:23:16,173 --> 00:23:20,086
I'm reducing speed shortly
so it'll pass offshore.

290
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:23,603
I hope. The <i>Rockhampton</i>,
I think we can discount at present.

291
00:23:23,773 --> 00:23:26,333
- It'll be a tight squeeze, sir.
- And a chance.

292
00:23:26,493 --> 00:23:29,610
Double the lookouts and turn tail
at every shadow of smoke.

293
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:32,241
- Keep ours at a minimum.
- But that destroyer...

294
00:23:32,413 --> 00:23:34,529
...she can cut us off, sir.

295
00:23:34,693 --> 00:23:36,923
That is no longer our course,
Mr. Bachman.

296
00:23:37,093 --> 00:23:41,405
We're not attempting
to make Yokohama. That is all.

297
00:23:43,653 --> 00:23:46,565
Sir, if we're turning south,
what will we burn for coal?

298
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:48,803
What will we eat?
There are no ports.

299
00:23:48,973 --> 00:23:53,046
I'll appropriate food at the shipwreck
relief station on Auckland Island.

300
00:23:53,213 --> 00:23:56,285
- But fuel...
- One thing at a time, Mr. Kirchner.

301
00:23:56,453 --> 00:24:00,082
I think you're well indoctrinated
in the game of follow-the-leader.

302
00:24:00,253 --> 00:24:03,643
- Yes, but I was under the impression...
- Muster all hands.

303
00:24:06,893 --> 00:24:08,645
You're to keep all ports covered.

304
00:24:08,813 --> 00:24:11,486
Smoking lamp is out
except on specific order.

305
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:13,769
And nothing to be thrown overboard.

306
00:24:13,973 --> 00:24:17,932
- Nothing, from now on.
- I believe I have made it quite obvious...

307
00:24:18,093 --> 00:24:22,450
...to everyone onboard this ship
what my political views are.

308
00:24:22,653 --> 00:24:26,089
But now, for better or for worse,
we are at war.

309
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:29,649
This ship is halfway
around the world from its home.

310
00:24:30,173 --> 00:24:34,325
I intend to bring it under the safety
of the flag stead light.

311
00:24:36,213 --> 00:24:38,488
That is all.

312
00:24:43,333 --> 00:24:45,847
What about pay?
He's gonna work us navy-fashion.

313
00:24:46,013 --> 00:24:48,481
What's wrong with that?
I was in the old war.

314
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,121
- He talks well.
- Dishwasher third class?

315
00:24:51,293 --> 00:24:54,683
Sergeant. I'll show you my medals.

316
00:24:55,373 --> 00:24:57,170
Hey...

317
00:25:16,973 --> 00:25:20,852
All right, down there.
Get on with the work.

318
00:25:23,693 --> 00:25:27,322
Down there. Come on, break it up.

319
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:44,645
You might have asked me to the muster.
Is there a reason I should be in the dark?

320
00:25:44,813 --> 00:25:47,646
- There is.
- What?

321
00:25:48,013 --> 00:25:50,322
I'll tell you forward.

322
00:25:51,933 --> 00:25:55,482
Find something to keep you busy
on the well deck.

323
00:25:58,053 --> 00:26:00,806
You will keep off the main decks,
night and day...

324
00:26:00,973 --> 00:26:04,443
...and off the bridge
unless specifically ordered there.

325
00:26:04,613 --> 00:26:07,969
You can take your exercise
on the after part of the boat deck...

326
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:12,365
...and keep out of the inboard passage
to the officers' quarters.

327
00:26:13,413 --> 00:26:15,973
Just where are we going?

328
00:26:16,133 --> 00:26:21,207
I would also suggest you wear something
a little more suitable for the ship.

329
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:22,362
Why?

330
00:26:22,773 --> 00:26:27,608
The officers and men aboard this ship
haven't had shore leave since Singapore.

331
00:26:29,493 --> 00:26:33,042
Are you speaking entirely
for the officers and men, captain?

332
00:26:33,853 --> 00:26:35,684
Not entirely.

333
00:26:35,853 --> 00:26:37,366
We're all human.

334
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:42,243
But, unfortunately, at sea there's
no chance to enjoy our humanity.

335
00:26:43,653 --> 00:26:47,168
Your meals will be served in your cabin.
I think that does it.

336
00:26:47,853 --> 00:26:50,287
If there's anything else you need,
let me know.

337
00:26:51,453 --> 00:26:53,091
Thanks.

338
00:27:00,173 --> 00:27:04,963
By estimate, the <i>Ergenstrasse</i>
was carrying less than 600 tons of coal.

339
00:27:05,133 --> 00:27:09,923
He has to go north, reaching for Truk
or other of the Japanese mandates.

340
00:27:10,093 --> 00:27:13,927
With the <i>Cressy</i> in his path and ourselves
and <i>Eden</i> closing in, that's it.

341
00:27:14,093 --> 00:27:15,811
Yes, that should be it.

342
00:27:15,973 --> 00:27:19,045
Let's not be so pessimistic, Napier.

343
00:27:21,293 --> 00:27:22,612
- Bosun.
- Yes, sir?

344
00:27:22,773 --> 00:27:26,732
- Make sure the deadlights are closed.
- Right, sir.

345
00:27:32,653 --> 00:27:34,723
So we play fox and hounds, captain?

346
00:27:34,893 --> 00:27:36,770
Successfully so far, chief.

347
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:39,731
But from now on
it's an engineer's operation.

348
00:27:39,893 --> 00:27:42,009
Let's take a look at the books.

349
00:27:42,173 --> 00:27:45,802
See how much coal we have,
how much we're gonna need.

350
00:27:45,973 --> 00:27:47,292
It's bad.

351
00:27:47,453 --> 00:27:49,683
- You can burn wood, can't you?
- Sure, but...

352
00:27:49,853 --> 00:27:52,128
Well, I'm getting you wood.

353
00:27:52,293 --> 00:27:55,410
Figure out how many cords
you'll need for the 2600 miles...

354
00:27:55,573 --> 00:27:58,963
...between Pom Pom Galli
and Valparaiso.

355
00:27:59,173 --> 00:28:00,447
Pom Pom Galli?

356
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:02,808
Now to Auckland,
then to Pom Pom Galli?

357
00:28:03,293 --> 00:28:06,410
On what coal we have and a prayer.

358
00:28:06,573 --> 00:28:07,847
- Mr. Kruger.
- Yes, sir.

359
00:28:08,013 --> 00:28:10,368
- Keep that headset glued to your ears.
- Aye.

360
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:13,127
To Valparaiso, one-third
the way around the world.

361
00:28:13,293 --> 00:28:15,523
- That's right.
- You need saws and axes...

362
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:17,126
...to cut your wood.

363
00:28:17,413 --> 00:28:19,847
- I'll make them for you.
- Good man.

364
00:28:20,013 --> 00:28:23,972
We'll need double-bitted axes
and two-man saws.

365
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:27,170
But the next time home, I retire.

366
00:28:27,333 --> 00:28:28,812
No more.

367
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:31,726
The years have run
their journey over me.

368
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:36,330
From now on, it's my little farm
and my grandchildren.

369
00:28:36,493 --> 00:28:39,530
You know, it's funny
about grandchildren:

370
00:28:39,693 --> 00:28:42,127
They seem closer to you...

371
00:28:42,293 --> 00:28:44,124
You don't have any children.

372
00:28:44,293 --> 00:28:45,612
No, I have no family.

373
00:28:45,773 --> 00:28:49,971
But you get me to Valparaiso,
and I'll promise you yours.

374
00:28:51,053 --> 00:28:54,602
The dreams, eh, captain?
The old days?

375
00:28:55,333 --> 00:28:58,723
A man has weakness or strength,
Schmitt.

376
00:28:58,893 --> 00:29:03,091
Weakness, you can hide,
like red lead over a sprung rivet...

377
00:29:03,253 --> 00:29:05,164
...but it'll give under strain.

378
00:29:05,333 --> 00:29:08,848
Strength, you cannot defeat. Ever.

379
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,447
Don't worry about me, captain.

380
00:29:11,613 --> 00:29:13,604
I'll shovel you to Valparaiso.

381
00:29:13,773 --> 00:29:16,685
I'll shovel you all the way home.

382
00:29:20,173 --> 00:29:23,848
<i>Tomorrow came, and the next day,</i>
<i>and the next...</i>

383
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:26,129
<i>... the</i> Ergenstrasse <i>still unreported.</i>

384
00:29:26,333 --> 00:29:30,087
<i>We'd been hoping she'd break</i>
<i>wireless silence, but she never did.</i>

385
00:29:30,253 --> 00:29:34,804
<i>Ehrlich was like a fox, choosing his</i>
<i>secret places and listening to us.</i>

386
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:37,851
<i>All we needed was one clue.</i>
<i>Then, with our speed...</i>

387
00:29:38,013 --> 00:29:41,892
<i>... the search would end with</i>
<i>a flash of pursuit and a burst of guns.</i>

388
00:29:42,053 --> 00:29:46,331
<i>With Ehrlich 's fuel range, we could rule</i>
<i>out the vast Pacific toward the west.</i>

389
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:51,203
<i>Eastward, he could reach the Indian</i>
<i>Ocean, but he'd be even worse off there.</i>

390
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:54,171
<i>And south? That didn 't seem probable...</i>

391
00:29:54,333 --> 00:29:57,848
<i>... because nothing was there</i>
<i>except the Antarctic.</i>

392
00:30:56,533 --> 00:30:59,684
Careful, I'm afraid you're showing
a light here.

393
00:31:00,253 --> 00:31:02,403
It seems to be stuck.

394
00:31:03,493 --> 00:31:05,882
You'll have to keep it closed.

395
00:31:06,093 --> 00:31:09,165
You know our captain's orders.

396
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:16,048
I think I'm going slightly mad,
day in and day out.

397
00:31:16,213 --> 00:31:17,646
I've read until I'm blind.

398
00:31:17,813 --> 00:31:20,646
I've walked my 10 feet
of private deck until I'm numb.

399
00:31:20,813 --> 00:31:24,203
This is going to be an unpleasant trip
for a woman.

400
00:31:24,573 --> 00:31:27,087
For anyone with no work to do.

401
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:29,892
Think the captain has a chance
of getting anywhere?

402
00:31:30,053 --> 00:31:34,092
I don't know.
He has irritatingly good judgment.

403
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:36,932
At sea, he knows all the answers.

404
00:31:37,253 --> 00:31:39,972
But if and when we ever get home...

405
00:31:41,413 --> 00:31:43,131
What?

406
00:31:43,293 --> 00:31:46,046
My uncle is very high in the party,
you know.

407
00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:51,489
Then why are you on this ship?
Why not a more important job?

408
00:31:51,653 --> 00:31:53,132
Don't judge by appearances.

409
00:31:53,293 --> 00:31:56,171
As an agent, you should know better.
I'm Intelligence.

410
00:31:56,373 --> 00:31:59,649
Navy reserve. Harbor survey.

411
00:32:00,093 --> 00:32:02,482
And it seems that
I stayed at it too long.

412
00:32:03,613 --> 00:32:05,888
I stayed in Australia too long.

413
00:32:07,053 --> 00:32:09,726
What about my gramophone?
Would that help the mood?

414
00:32:10,253 --> 00:32:12,767
I've got some wonderful recordings
of Wagner.

415
00:32:12,933 --> 00:32:14,412
How cheerful.

416
00:32:14,573 --> 00:32:18,088
Well, l... I've got some
popular things too.

417
00:32:18,253 --> 00:32:20,483
Quite an excellent collection.

418
00:32:22,093 --> 00:32:25,130
- Will you wait?
- Oh, I'll be at home all evening.

419
00:32:36,773 --> 00:32:38,604
Memories...

420
00:32:39,533 --> 00:32:41,524
Pleasant memories?

421
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:43,729
Exciting ones.

422
00:32:44,853 --> 00:32:46,889
How long ago?

423
00:32:49,253 --> 00:32:51,608
A thousand years.

424
00:32:54,053 --> 00:32:56,772
Let's you and I go into partnership.

425
00:32:57,693 --> 00:32:59,331
What kind of partnership?

426
00:32:59,493 --> 00:33:01,802
We're in the same game,
let's play together.

427
00:33:01,973 --> 00:33:04,407
You tell me your troubles,
I'll tell you mine.

428
00:33:04,573 --> 00:33:08,486
And if we get a chance,
we'll haul out together.

429
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:12,328
That's fair enough.
What are your troubles?

430
00:33:16,373 --> 00:33:18,807
Mr. Kirchner.

431
00:33:20,093 --> 00:33:23,130
May I remind you
that you're not on a cruise ship...

432
00:33:23,293 --> 00:33:26,285
...and this is technically still my cabin.

433
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,404
Yes, sir.

434
00:33:33,453 --> 00:33:36,047
- I asked him to come in.
- I daresay you did.

435
00:33:36,213 --> 00:33:38,488
I asked him to leave.

436
00:33:40,173 --> 00:33:42,607
My officers' quarters
are off-limits to you...

437
00:33:42,773 --> 00:33:45,765
...and this cabin is off-limits
to my officers.

438
00:33:45,933 --> 00:33:47,730
Do I make myself clear?

439
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,165
Quite.

440
00:34:02,893 --> 00:34:05,202
They're short of ships
in the North Atlantic.

441
00:34:05,373 --> 00:34:07,568
That's probably where we'll be sent.

442
00:34:07,733 --> 00:34:10,201
I wish they'd get on with it.

443
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:16,249
This fellow's short of stores and fuel.
He can't cause much trouble.

444
00:34:16,893 --> 00:34:19,407
He has a genius for it.

445
00:34:42,093 --> 00:34:44,129
Land ho!

446
00:34:44,293 --> 00:34:46,409
Land ho!

447
00:34:46,573 --> 00:34:50,612
- Where away?
- A point off the starboard bow.

448
00:34:54,733 --> 00:34:57,930
- That'll be Auckland Island.
- I think it will be, Mr. Stemme.

449
00:34:58,093 --> 00:34:59,162
- Log it.
- Yes, sir.

450
00:34:59,333 --> 00:35:01,483
- Mr. Kirchner.
- Sir?

451
00:35:01,653 --> 00:35:04,451
- Prepare to launch your boat.
- Aye, aye, sir.

452
00:35:09,573 --> 00:35:12,167
- Mr. Kirchner.
- Sir?

453
00:35:12,493 --> 00:35:16,168
I am forced to commandeer food
from the shipwreck station...

454
00:35:16,333 --> 00:35:20,008
...but make sure that you leave
enough rations for any emergency...

455
00:35:20,173 --> 00:35:22,323
...until the next relief ship arrives.

456
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:24,091
Aye, aye, sir.

457
00:36:02,853 --> 00:36:05,287
Looks like we have company.

458
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:31,367
- Are there any more of you?
- No.

459
00:36:31,533 --> 00:36:34,206
We're the only survivors
of the trawler <i>Bermagui</i>.

460
00:36:34,373 --> 00:36:38,048
You can put that gun down,
whoever ye are. We are fishermen.

461
00:36:38,213 --> 00:36:39,248
What ship are you?

462
00:36:39,413 --> 00:36:41,643
The freighter <i>Joanna</i>,
Dutch East India line.

463
00:36:41,813 --> 00:36:44,281
But we can't take you aboard.
Smallpox.

464
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:47,491
We can't touch any ports.
We have to tap your provisions.

465
00:36:47,653 --> 00:36:51,407
Bosun, start loading those provisions
into the boat.

466
00:37:01,093 --> 00:37:04,324
Do you think you're doing right?
Robbing a shipwreck station?

467
00:37:04,493 --> 00:37:07,132
I'll leave enough till
another ship calls for you.

468
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:10,683
That's all well and good,
if we get the wireless working.

469
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:14,209
Don't worry.
We'll send out your SOS.

470
00:38:06,653 --> 00:38:10,202
Mr. Kirchner, have you seen
the charts on the Chatham Islands?

471
00:38:10,373 --> 00:38:13,843
Second officer corrected them, sir.
Took them to your day cabin.

472
00:38:14,053 --> 00:38:16,123
Thank you.

473
00:38:26,333 --> 00:38:29,882
- Yes?
- I have to look at a couple of charts.

474
00:38:33,053 --> 00:38:35,089
Sorry to have bothered you.

475
00:38:35,253 --> 00:38:38,086
I hope I haven't
bothered you too much.

476
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:45,409
You've got enough of that stuff
to keep you busy the whole trip.

477
00:38:45,573 --> 00:38:49,282
Fortunately. What else is there to do?

478
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:54,447
- Have a drink, perhaps. Would that help?
- It never hurts.

479
00:39:00,373 --> 00:39:02,682
Suppose you do get all the way home.

480
00:39:02,853 --> 00:39:07,165
There's no place there for you,
under the present government.

481
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:11,451
What else could I do?
Certainly not default to the enemy.

482
00:39:11,613 --> 00:39:16,482
Have you ever in your life made
a compromise with a conviction?

483
00:39:17,653 --> 00:39:22,807
I was always afraid that if I started,
it wouldn't be easy to stop.

484
00:39:23,093 --> 00:39:27,769
I suppose you're referring to me.
Intending an insult.

485
00:39:28,013 --> 00:39:30,447
I think you should know
one thing, captain:

486
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:32,171
You can't insult me...

487
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:34,927
...because I hold no value
for the way you think.

488
00:39:35,093 --> 00:39:37,448
And I know the way you think.

489
00:39:37,613 --> 00:39:40,252
- Ideals and gallantries...
- That's right.

490
00:39:40,413 --> 00:39:41,926
The officer's code.

491
00:39:42,253 --> 00:39:44,562
That's the way my father thought.

492
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:46,212
He was a general.

493
00:39:46,373 --> 00:39:48,967
A very great gentleman
of the old school.

494
00:39:49,133 --> 00:39:51,249
But after the war,
when things changed...

495
00:39:51,413 --> 00:39:54,291
...and he discovered that
uniforms, medals and honor...

496
00:39:54,453 --> 00:39:57,889
...couldn't buy food and medicine
for his family, what did he do?

497
00:39:58,053 --> 00:40:01,090
He couldn't beg
or violate the code, no.

498
00:40:01,253 --> 00:40:03,403
So he shot himself.

499
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:06,970
Leaving me and my sisters
and my mother to survive.

500
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:09,044
That was his way...

501
00:40:09,213 --> 00:40:10,487
...and your way.

502
00:40:10,693 --> 00:40:12,331
But it's not my way.

503
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,812
I survived, all right.

504
00:40:13,973 --> 00:40:16,533
I made my own life, my own code.

505
00:40:16,693 --> 00:40:20,811
You have your medals and your trophies.
Well, I have my trophies too.

506
00:40:20,973 --> 00:40:23,203
You see, I have succeeded,
Captain Ehrlich.

507
00:40:23,373 --> 00:40:27,082
Did anyone ever tell you that
you're beautiful when you're angry?

508
00:40:27,533 --> 00:40:30,843
The captain hasn't had shore leave
since Singapore.

509
00:40:33,573 --> 00:40:36,406
You're quite a woman, Elsa.

510
00:41:20,493 --> 00:41:22,723
He was in your room.

511
00:41:22,893 --> 00:41:24,884
He came to get some charts.

512
00:41:25,053 --> 00:41:27,283
Took him quite a while.

513
00:41:27,813 --> 00:41:30,532
His only interest is his ship.

514
00:41:30,693 --> 00:41:32,490
He's a strange man.

515
00:41:32,653 --> 00:41:35,292
In anyone else,
his beliefs would be a pose.

516
00:41:35,453 --> 00:41:37,762
Not Ehrlich. They're his life.

517
00:41:37,933 --> 00:41:41,130
You sound as if you're losing
your dislike for him.

518
00:41:41,293 --> 00:41:43,409
I don't think that will happen.

519
00:41:43,573 --> 00:41:45,609
Anyway, what difference
does it make?

520
00:41:45,773 --> 00:41:48,765
We're gonna be a long time
tied down on this ship.

521
00:41:48,933 --> 00:41:51,652
A long, dreary time.

522
00:41:52,293 --> 00:41:53,612
I expect we'll survive.

523
00:41:53,773 --> 00:41:58,563
Well, with certain
compensating moments, perhaps.

524
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:00,724
Elsa...

525
00:42:01,693 --> 00:42:04,526
...I find you a very
fascinating woman.

526
00:42:04,693 --> 00:42:05,887
Do you?

527
00:42:08,813 --> 00:42:11,168
I don't like impatient men.

528
00:42:11,333 --> 00:42:14,962
I can be very, very patient,
as long as I know he isn't...

529
00:42:15,093 --> 00:42:17,653
He isn't.
And he won't be.

530
00:42:24,253 --> 00:42:25,891
Chief.

531
00:42:26,133 --> 00:42:28,203
Chief, you're cutting down
on my speed.

532
00:42:28,413 --> 00:42:32,167
We're gonna need every day and minute
when we get to Pom Pom Galli...

533
00:42:32,333 --> 00:42:35,643
...when the <i>Rockhampton</i> starts making
its sweep to the north.

534
00:42:35,813 --> 00:42:39,931
- What's the matter with you?
- Headwinds, captain.

535
00:42:41,173 --> 00:42:42,447
It's the headwinds.

536
00:42:42,613 --> 00:42:45,002
I didn't wanna tell you
until I was positive...

537
00:42:45,173 --> 00:42:48,927
...but we don't have enough coal
to run to Pom Pom Galli.

538
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:52,530
- Are you sure?
- That's the story.

539
00:42:53,773 --> 00:42:55,968
No coal, eh?

540
00:42:56,133 --> 00:42:57,771
No coal.

541
00:42:57,933 --> 00:42:59,252
Well, we got wood.

542
00:42:59,413 --> 00:43:02,883
We'll burn this ship in her own fires.

543
00:43:23,733 --> 00:43:26,452
Ask the engine room,
how does it look.

544
00:43:27,973 --> 00:43:30,248
<i>- Engine room.</i>
- How's the wood lasting?

545
00:43:30,413 --> 00:43:32,085
<i>Four more hours, I can give you.</i>

546
00:43:32,253 --> 00:43:34,972
Chief engineer says he can
only give four more hours.

547
00:43:40,173 --> 00:43:43,051
Then we'll start on the lifeboats.

548
00:43:43,373 --> 00:43:45,329
And if that isn't enough...

549
00:43:45,493 --> 00:43:48,291
...we'll tear out the hatches
and the doors...

550
00:43:48,453 --> 00:43:50,648
...take our chances on the weather.

551
00:43:50,813 --> 00:43:52,246
- Winkler.
- Yes, sir?

552
00:43:52,733 --> 00:43:54,564
My sextant.

553
00:44:01,893 --> 00:44:04,805
- Captain, sir.
- Yes?

554
00:44:04,973 --> 00:44:08,648
I'm no informer, but I think there's
something you're entitled to know.

555
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,531
Know what?

556
00:44:10,693 --> 00:44:12,524
From the forecastle...

557
00:44:12,973 --> 00:44:15,567
...they're saying a ship
belongs to her captain...

558
00:44:15,733 --> 00:44:18,042
...but the lifeboats belong to her crew.

559
00:44:22,333 --> 00:44:24,289
How do you feel about it, Winkler?

560
00:44:24,493 --> 00:44:28,771
I don't know, sir.
I haven't made up my mind.

561
00:44:29,813 --> 00:44:31,769
- Stemme.
- Yes, sir?

562
00:44:31,933 --> 00:44:35,687
- Have the chief meet me in my cabin.
- Right, sir.

563
00:44:36,293 --> 00:44:38,363
Thanks for telling me.

564
00:44:48,653 --> 00:44:50,769
All hands, turn to.

565
00:44:51,813 --> 00:44:53,485
Trouble?

566
00:44:53,653 --> 00:44:55,689
Perhaps not.

567
00:44:56,973 --> 00:44:58,486
Chief.

568
00:44:58,933 --> 00:45:01,163
Down to the lifeboats, huh?

569
00:45:01,333 --> 00:45:03,130
Right.

570
00:45:09,933 --> 00:45:12,242
- Bosun.
- Aye, sir?

571
00:45:12,613 --> 00:45:16,208
Let go of the lashings on number three
and number four boats...

572
00:45:16,413 --> 00:45:19,211
...and smash them for fuel.

573
00:45:20,653 --> 00:45:22,006
All right, sir.

574
00:45:23,293 --> 00:45:28,162
Schlieter, you other men, swing in
number one and number two boats.

575
00:45:39,293 --> 00:45:41,966
All right, start working.

576
00:45:50,733 --> 00:45:52,689
They're breaking up the boats, chief.

577
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:57,085
Yes. There are two more,
and we'll have to use those too.

578
00:46:11,253 --> 00:46:16,122
Will you kindly stay off the bridge
and in your cabin.

579
00:46:25,693 --> 00:46:28,765
Engine room reports
pressure still dropping, sir.

580
00:46:35,413 --> 00:46:37,244
All right...

581
00:46:38,173 --> 00:46:40,004
...break up boat number two.

582
00:47:52,733 --> 00:47:55,725
Land ho! Land ho!

583
00:47:55,933 --> 00:47:58,891
- Where away?
- A point off starboard bow, sir.

584
00:48:01,213 --> 00:48:03,681
Log it, Mr. Kirchner.

585
00:48:04,373 --> 00:48:08,651
Schlieter, don't let
there be a next time.

586
00:48:48,333 --> 00:48:52,372
Ease your helm. Midship.

587
00:48:58,333 --> 00:49:00,449
Row bottom at 20 fathoms, sir.

588
00:49:00,893 --> 00:49:02,884
Let go!

589
00:49:12,613 --> 00:49:14,968
Tell Mr. Schmitt...

590
00:49:15,613 --> 00:49:17,922
...we're finished with the engine.

591
00:49:18,933 --> 00:49:21,367
Present!

592
00:49:21,533 --> 00:49:23,125
Fire!

593
00:49:23,333 --> 00:49:26,166
Firing party, present!

594
00:49:30,013 --> 00:49:33,244
Firing party, general salute.
Present.

595
00:49:40,133 --> 00:49:43,125
<i>We were instructed to continue</i>
<i>the search...</i>

596
00:49:43,293 --> 00:49:46,171
<i>... and in order that the German ship</i>
<i>not be alerted...</i>

597
00:49:46,333 --> 00:49:48,483
<i>... to make no mention</i>
<i>of the atrocity...</i>

598
00:49:48,653 --> 00:49:51,565
<i>... until the authorities decided</i>
<i>to release the news.</i>

599
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:53,644
<i>But what the world would think...</i>

600
00:49:53,813 --> 00:49:56,247
<i>... didn 't matter to the men</i>
<i>of the</i> Rockhampton.

601
00:49:56,413 --> 00:50:00,088
<i>This was no longer the mere pursuit</i>
<i>of a freighter by a naval vessel...</i>

602
00:50:00,293 --> 00:50:03,842
<i>... but a crusade against</i>
<i>the criminals of the</i> Ergenstrasse.

603
00:50:04,013 --> 00:50:05,651
<i>And to me...</i>

604
00:50:05,813 --> 00:50:09,806
<i>... henceforth, a hateful vendetta</i>
<i>against the friend I'd lost...</i>

605
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:11,804
<i>... somewhere back there.</i>

606
00:50:11,973 --> 00:50:17,411
<i>Karl Ehrlich, a man I had</i>
<i>ceased to know.</i>

607
00:50:21,813 --> 00:50:25,249
From here to Valparaiso,
it's a 14-day run.

608
00:50:25,373 --> 00:50:29,730
To get there, the <i>Ergenstrasse</i> will burn
30 cords of wood a day.

609
00:50:29,893 --> 00:50:32,168
Mr. Schmitt will tell you
what that means.

610
00:50:32,573 --> 00:50:36,248
It means we work 14 hours a day.
Full hours.

611
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:38,688
We get moonlight in four days.

612
00:50:38,893 --> 00:50:41,965
When it comes,
we work 18 hours a day.

613
00:50:42,173 --> 00:50:47,042
We know it's going to be hard
and difficult, but it's the only way home.

614
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:50,768
And for your further information,
this is an uninhabited island.

615
00:50:50,973 --> 00:50:53,612
I repeat, an uninhabited island.

616
00:50:53,773 --> 00:50:55,570
Now, we're short of provisions.

617
00:50:55,773 --> 00:50:57,968
There's fresh water ashore,
but no food...

618
00:50:58,133 --> 00:51:00,886
...except a few coconut palms
and breadfruit trees.

619
00:51:01,053 --> 00:51:03,283
And I intend to ration them.

620
00:51:05,414 --> 00:51:07,769
As for recreation, you'll have
little time for it.

621
00:51:08,134 --> 00:51:12,685
However, there will be swimming parties
morning, midday and evening.

622
00:51:12,894 --> 00:51:15,533
As we all know,
there is a woman onboard...

623
00:51:15,694 --> 00:51:18,128
...so it will be necessary
for me to ask you...

624
00:51:18,294 --> 00:51:23,049
...to wear some kind of clothing
during your morning and evening swims.

625
00:51:23,334 --> 00:51:29,443
During the midday break, our passenger
will cooperate and remain in her quarters.

626
00:51:29,654 --> 00:51:33,806
That is all. Bosun, turn them to.

627
00:51:52,854 --> 00:51:54,412
Heinz.

628
00:51:55,614 --> 00:51:57,047
I'm all right, sir.

629
00:51:57,214 --> 00:52:00,251
Of course you are, but we got
more important work for you.

630
00:52:00,414 --> 00:52:04,407
- You're an old soldier, aren't you?
- Yes, sir. Sergeant in the signal corps.

631
00:52:04,574 --> 00:52:07,725
- So I've heard. You see that peak?
- Yes, sir.

632
00:52:07,894 --> 00:52:09,122
You'll be our lookout.

633
00:52:09,294 --> 00:52:11,603
You go up there and watch for smoke.

634
00:52:11,774 --> 00:52:15,130
All points of the compass,
every daylight hour.

635
00:52:15,294 --> 00:52:17,046
And no daydreaming.

636
00:52:17,214 --> 00:52:21,287
We're all in your hands.
The ship, all of us.

637
00:52:21,774 --> 00:52:27,053
- Yes, sir.
- Here. Wear my glasses.

638
00:52:28,454 --> 00:52:30,365
Yes, sir.

639
00:52:34,014 --> 00:52:36,608
Back to your pots and pans,
huh, soldier?

640
00:52:36,774 --> 00:52:41,643
I am the lookout.
You are all in my hands.

641
00:52:44,414 --> 00:52:46,644
Very thoughtful of you.

642
00:52:47,694 --> 00:52:50,970
But don't you think that climb
is a little hard for him?

643
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,011
It is.

644
00:52:53,614 --> 00:52:57,004
And it is also near midday,
if you don't mind my reminding you.

645
00:52:57,134 --> 00:52:59,489
Mr. Bachman will see you
to your quarters.

646
00:53:10,694 --> 00:53:14,403
Everybody up the boat deck
before you go below.

647
00:53:15,614 --> 00:53:19,573
Both hands up to the elbows.
Nothing like brine for a toughener.

648
00:53:19,734 --> 00:53:22,168
Won't help the rat bites.

649
00:53:23,894 --> 00:53:25,725
- When did you get that?
- Last night.

650
00:53:25,894 --> 00:53:28,533
Me too. On the leg.

651
00:53:28,774 --> 00:53:31,925
Well, we'll see what we can
do about it.

652
00:53:32,454 --> 00:53:36,447
- How are your people doing, chief?
- Keeping ahead of you, captain.

653
00:53:36,614 --> 00:53:38,366
Good.

654
00:53:41,254 --> 00:53:45,293
Brounck? Pack some food for Heinz.
I'll take it up to him tomorrow.

655
00:53:46,294 --> 00:53:47,886
What have you there?

656
00:53:48,054 --> 00:53:51,490
Some of the meat is rotten.
I was going to throw it over the side.

657
00:53:51,694 --> 00:53:55,653
You'll keep it. We'll use
everything aboard this ship.

658
00:54:22,894 --> 00:54:25,488
A lonely place for a grave.

659
00:54:25,654 --> 00:54:30,569
We'll have to get it cleaned up
before we leave.

660
00:54:30,734 --> 00:54:32,133
I wonder who it is.

661
00:54:32,294 --> 00:54:36,253
Schaffner and Becht.
Fever got them.

662
00:54:36,654 --> 00:54:41,284
I was young Stemme's age then,
in charge of the burial party.

663
00:54:41,454 --> 00:54:43,490
Yes, we'll have to get it cleaned up.

664
00:54:44,134 --> 00:54:46,773
And you remember their names
after all this time?

665
00:54:47,654 --> 00:54:50,930
The Greeks believed that a man
was immortal...

666
00:54:51,094 --> 00:54:54,166
...as long as his name
was remembered on earth.

667
00:54:54,854 --> 00:54:56,572
These two were good men.

668
00:54:59,214 --> 00:55:01,011
Seamen.

669
00:55:01,934 --> 00:55:05,768
You wanna see the island,
I'm taking this food up to the peak.

670
00:55:06,734 --> 00:55:08,452
Thank you.

671
00:55:32,934 --> 00:55:35,846
You'd better take a little rest.

672
00:55:41,854 --> 00:55:44,607
I hope the old soldier is all right.

673
00:55:45,574 --> 00:55:48,088
Tougher climb than I thought.

674
00:55:49,094 --> 00:55:51,927
In all your life,
you've never done very much...

675
00:55:52,094 --> 00:55:55,166
...except for your men and your ships,
have you?

676
00:55:55,334 --> 00:55:59,964
When I was a cadet, they taught us
that was a way of life.

677
00:56:00,134 --> 00:56:04,730
Pretty hard to change what you learn
in your youth and believe.

678
00:56:05,374 --> 00:56:08,446
And that's what this whole
fantastic voyage is, really:

679
00:56:08,614 --> 00:56:11,731
A habit of life,
stubbornness of the soul.

680
00:56:11,894 --> 00:56:15,489
Not entirely. This is a part of the war.

681
00:56:15,654 --> 00:56:18,043
I'm still beating the enemy at it.

682
00:56:19,774 --> 00:56:23,210
You've never really been
in love, have you?

683
00:56:23,734 --> 00:56:27,170
Once or twice I've had
charming illusions.

684
00:56:28,334 --> 00:56:31,724
But never strong enough
to chance marriage?

685
00:56:32,214 --> 00:56:37,208
To put it another way,
I'm a practical man, a realist.

686
00:56:38,854 --> 00:56:42,483
With only one love, the sea.

687
00:56:42,654 --> 00:56:45,691
I never quite looked at it that way.

688
00:56:46,454 --> 00:56:49,605
I'm beginning to understand
why men go to sea.

689
00:56:49,774 --> 00:56:51,446
I've been watching it.

690
00:56:51,614 --> 00:56:53,411
It's never the same.

691
00:56:53,574 --> 00:56:55,644
One moment calm...

692
00:56:55,814 --> 00:56:57,850
...then stormy.

693
00:56:58,014 --> 00:57:01,211
Darkness, light...

694
00:57:01,374 --> 00:57:04,013
- It's always changing.
- Like a woman.

695
00:57:08,094 --> 00:57:10,085
A mystery.

696
00:57:11,374 --> 00:57:14,093
Part of a great mystery.

697
00:57:16,814 --> 00:57:18,486
When I first met you...

698
00:57:18,654 --> 00:57:22,203
...I never thought I could sit here
trying to understand you.

699
00:57:24,694 --> 00:57:26,810
Or even liking you.

700
00:57:54,654 --> 00:57:57,646
I'll give you a hand, Mr. Kirchner.

701
00:58:15,134 --> 00:58:17,602
That should stop you.

702
00:58:17,774 --> 00:58:21,813
- Teaching her chess, chief?
- No, she's teaching me.

703
00:58:21,974 --> 00:58:25,649
- Everything go well today, captain?
- Wonderful.

704
00:58:27,254 --> 00:58:29,484
I'm glad to hear it.

705
00:58:30,414 --> 00:58:33,008
I hear you've asked for
a work party for tonight.

706
00:58:33,174 --> 00:58:34,163
That's the order.

707
00:58:34,334 --> 00:58:37,451
Don't you think you're pushing
them beyond their capacities?

708
00:58:37,614 --> 00:58:38,933
These men aren't you.

709
00:58:39,094 --> 00:58:42,609
A man's capacity is
usually relative to his goal.

710
00:58:42,774 --> 00:58:44,924
You've got them working
incredible hours.

711
00:58:45,094 --> 00:58:47,483
While there's a full moon,
they'll work nights.

712
00:58:47,654 --> 00:58:50,612
They won't be able to go on
if you persist in driving...

713
00:58:52,014 --> 00:58:55,973
Elsa, in there.

714
00:59:02,214 --> 00:59:05,889
I forgot to mention a highly probable
reason why I've never married:

715
00:59:06,054 --> 00:59:08,124
I like to run my own ship.

716
00:59:08,294 --> 00:59:10,171
Excuse me, sir, Miss Elsa.

717
00:59:10,334 --> 00:59:12,689
Everything will be ready,
as you ordered.

718
00:59:12,854 --> 00:59:15,414
Won't be able to give you
anything special to eat.

719
00:59:15,574 --> 00:59:18,327
But this is the last bottle,
as cold as I can get it.

720
00:59:18,494 --> 00:59:21,611
I found your navy buttons
and put them in your white jacket.

721
00:59:21,774 --> 00:59:24,242
Special dinner tonight, Elsa.
Captain's orders.

722
00:59:24,414 --> 00:59:27,451
Our best tablecloth.
Haven't used it since Singapore.

723
00:59:27,614 --> 00:59:29,366
Brounck.

724
00:59:33,574 --> 00:59:36,486
So not since Singapore?

725
00:59:44,734 --> 00:59:48,204
- Did you remove the rat guard?
- Right now, sir.

726
00:59:49,414 --> 00:59:53,123
- How's it going ashore?
- Nearly finished, sir.

727
00:59:55,094 --> 01:00:00,612
Smear it as far out as you can.
That ought to do it in reverse.

728
01:00:01,334 --> 01:00:05,532
I got to admit, I was wrong this time.
I thought he was gonna feed it to us.

729
01:00:05,694 --> 01:00:08,652
Let's get back to the ship
and get clean.

730
01:00:24,814 --> 01:00:27,374
- What's the matter?
- Rats!

731
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:33,771
Getting rid of some of our
more unwelcome passengers.

732
01:00:34,094 --> 01:00:35,766
Don't worry...

733
01:00:35,934 --> 01:00:38,050
...it's according to plan.

734
01:00:53,294 --> 01:00:54,568
How's it working?

735
01:00:54,774 --> 01:00:56,969
It's working.

736
01:00:57,494 --> 01:01:01,373
I'd hate to come back to this island
20 years from now.

737
01:01:07,454 --> 01:01:10,332
<i>Ours was the desperation</i>
<i>of groping in the dark.</i>

738
01:01:10,494 --> 01:01:14,453
<i>And then I began to remember an island</i>
<i>I'd once heard Ehrlich talk about:</i>

739
01:01:14,614 --> 01:01:16,093
<i>Pom Pom Galli.</i>

740
01:01:16,254 --> 01:01:19,087
<i>And our search was leading us</i>
<i>in its direction.</i>

741
01:01:19,254 --> 01:01:21,609
<i>I knew he was fighting</i>
<i>the laws of nature...</i>

742
01:01:21,774 --> 01:01:25,369
<i>... with survival hanging on the human</i>
<i>endurance of weary, driven men.</i>

743
01:01:25,534 --> 01:01:28,685
<i>If we could overtake him,</i>
<i>he would hang.</i>

744
01:01:28,854 --> 01:01:31,129
<i>He and his criminals.</i>

745
01:01:31,694 --> 01:01:34,572
We've scoured the Chathams,
Samoa, Fiji and the Tongas.

746
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:37,453
And it's very doubtful
he could make Pitcairn.

747
01:01:37,614 --> 01:01:40,128
It almost has to be
one of the Tuamotus.

748
01:01:40,294 --> 01:01:44,082
Some island with a deep harbor,
good water and a good stand of timber.

749
01:01:44,254 --> 01:01:47,690
He has some idea about an island
in one of the more remote groups.

750
01:01:47,854 --> 01:01:49,287
That's right, Pom Pom Galli.

751
01:01:49,454 --> 01:01:52,730
A place Ehrlich said the German raider
went in the last war.

752
01:01:52,894 --> 01:01:54,930
A reason why they
might not go there.

753
01:01:55,094 --> 01:01:58,086
I can't bypass
all islands in between.

754
01:01:58,254 --> 01:02:02,850
Unfortunately, I can name 50 such
islands over 1000 miles of ocean...

755
01:02:03,014 --> 01:02:05,482
...but search parties will be organized.

756
01:02:05,654 --> 01:02:07,326
- Thank you.
- This will take time.

757
01:02:07,494 --> 01:02:09,644
It'll take Ehrlich time
to chop his wood.

758
01:02:09,814 --> 01:02:13,204
The ax against the hangman's noose.

759
01:03:05,174 --> 01:03:07,563
I got a system working for me
on these trees.

760
01:03:07,734 --> 01:03:10,294
I pretend they're all named
Captain Ehrlich.

761
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:13,969
First I give him this!
Then I give him this!

762
01:03:14,174 --> 01:03:17,962
And then I slice him port to starboard!

763
01:03:24,534 --> 01:03:26,684
- How did it happen?
- It was an accident.

764
01:03:26,854 --> 01:03:29,322
No, it wasn't. It was my fault.
Sorry, Winkler.

765
01:03:29,494 --> 01:03:33,009
Get him aboard ship. Not you.

766
01:03:33,214 --> 01:03:36,251
All right, the rest of you,
get back to work.

767
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:40,973
Schlieter, from now on, you're gonna
do the work of two men.

768
01:03:41,134 --> 01:03:44,251
Not two like you, but two like him.

769
01:03:44,414 --> 01:03:46,644
Best man in our crew.

770
01:03:46,814 --> 01:03:49,567
And I don't think you can do it.

771
01:03:54,734 --> 01:03:58,044
Like I've been telling you,
there's one lifeboat left.

772
01:03:58,214 --> 01:04:00,409
Tahiti looks pretty good now, huh?

773
01:04:00,574 --> 01:04:05,523
Oh, shut up! I'll show him who's
the best man in this crew!

774
01:04:23,134 --> 01:04:25,967
Better hurry up with swimming.
You'll miss breakfast.

775
01:04:26,134 --> 01:04:27,408
That'd be a great loss.

776
01:04:27,574 --> 01:04:31,169
He means we might miss the pleasure
of our little excursion ashore.

777
01:04:50,094 --> 01:04:52,369
Shark! Shark out there!

778
01:04:53,174 --> 01:04:54,892
Shark!

779
01:05:05,574 --> 01:05:07,326
Help!

780
01:05:08,614 --> 01:05:11,003
Help!

781
01:05:15,134 --> 01:05:17,364
Help! Help! A shark!

782
01:05:46,654 --> 01:05:49,293
Woolrich, give me your shirt
for a tourniquet!

783
01:06:05,214 --> 01:06:07,284
- Brounck.
- Yes, sir.

784
01:06:07,454 --> 01:06:10,890
Clear a table
and boil all the water you can.

785
01:06:11,054 --> 01:06:13,807
Break out some clean sheets.

786
01:06:16,694 --> 01:06:18,252
Mr. Bachman.

787
01:06:21,254 --> 01:06:23,893
- Sir?
- Get him into the mess hall.

788
01:06:24,054 --> 01:06:25,533
Anything I can do, captain?

789
01:06:25,694 --> 01:06:28,492
Looks like we're gonna have to...

790
01:06:28,654 --> 01:06:32,442
- You better put an edge on that.
- I know, I know.

791
01:06:33,014 --> 01:06:37,405
You can be of some help
in the mess hall.

792
01:07:06,574 --> 01:07:08,530
Take this to shore and get rid of it.

793
01:07:08,694 --> 01:07:11,003
You'd better get on
with your working party.

794
01:07:11,174 --> 01:07:13,244
He's still alive.

795
01:07:37,334 --> 01:07:38,926
Give her one.

796
01:10:56,494 --> 01:10:59,213
It's awful nice of you
to do this, Miss Keller.

797
01:10:59,374 --> 01:11:01,934
No trouble at all.
I'll have them for you tonight.

798
01:11:02,094 --> 01:11:03,413
Thank you.

799
01:11:06,854 --> 01:11:10,563
- I'll give you a hand with that line.
- Well, thank you.

800
01:11:10,734 --> 01:11:13,965
You know, for the past
three or four days...

801
01:11:14,254 --> 01:11:16,927
My leg! My leg!

802
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:20,366
My leg!

803
01:11:21,574 --> 01:11:25,010
- My leg!
- Brounck! You know we need... Walter!

804
01:11:27,254 --> 01:11:28,972
Hurry!

805
01:11:29,134 --> 01:11:31,329
Walter.

806
01:11:46,214 --> 01:11:48,569
He'd be more comfortable in my cabin.

807
01:11:48,734 --> 01:11:51,009
- Get it ready, Brounck.
- Yes, sir.

808
01:11:52,854 --> 01:11:54,845
Take it away!

809
01:12:08,494 --> 01:12:10,325
Captain.

810
01:12:10,614 --> 01:12:11,888
What is it?

811
01:12:12,054 --> 01:12:14,773
I'm sorry to interrupt your work...

812
01:12:14,934 --> 01:12:18,051
...and I have no intention of telling you
how to run your ship.

813
01:12:18,494 --> 01:12:21,452
The only important thing now
is the condition of Stemme.

814
01:12:21,654 --> 01:12:23,372
We're doing the best we can.

815
01:12:23,574 --> 01:12:26,327
The <i>Rockhampton</i>
has a doctor onboard.

816
01:12:26,934 --> 01:12:29,607
Captain. A signal, sir.

817
01:12:33,454 --> 01:12:37,606
Elsa, if I were to call the <i>Rockhampton...</i>
First, let me explain about gangrene...

818
01:12:37,774 --> 01:12:41,449
This ship or 10 more like her
isn't worth this boy's life.

819
01:12:45,934 --> 01:12:50,007
Ashore there! Have Kirchner
report aboard immediately!

820
01:12:50,174 --> 01:12:53,564
Pardon me.
Kruger, join me in my cabin.

821
01:12:59,574 --> 01:13:00,973
You sent for me?

822
01:13:06,374 --> 01:13:10,890
At Auckland Island, Mr. Kirchner,
you committed murder.

823
01:13:12,534 --> 01:13:14,365
That word hardly applies in war.

824
01:13:14,534 --> 01:13:16,968
You slaughtered those fishermen
without cause.

825
01:13:17,134 --> 01:13:21,127
- I did what was necessary, expedient.
- Log it as it happened.

826
01:13:22,174 --> 01:13:24,734
I'm waiting, Mr. Kirchner.

827
01:13:36,054 --> 01:13:37,851
Did they attack you?

828
01:13:38,014 --> 01:13:41,404
I don't give my enemies
the opportunity to attack me.

829
01:13:48,654 --> 01:13:50,565
Were they armed?

830
01:13:50,894 --> 01:13:52,725
I didn't waste time searching them.

831
01:13:54,774 --> 01:13:56,765
So stated.

832
01:14:07,414 --> 01:14:09,245
Sign it!

833
01:14:23,014 --> 01:14:26,927
Ehrlich, I promise you,
you're gonna live to regret this.

834
01:14:30,374 --> 01:14:32,683
You'll continue to
address me as "captain"...

835
01:14:32,854 --> 01:14:35,243
...or spend the rest of this trip
in irons.

836
01:14:35,654 --> 01:14:40,887
I consider you a filthy murderer, unfit
to grace the company of decent men.

837
01:14:41,334 --> 01:14:43,211
You've dishonored a ship.

838
01:14:43,374 --> 01:14:46,889
Were we to be captured now,
we'd be tried and hanged as criminals...

839
01:14:47,054 --> 01:14:48,851
...and deservedly so.

840
01:14:49,054 --> 01:14:52,729
There are good men aboard this ship,
Kirchner, and dark nights.

841
01:14:52,894 --> 01:14:56,125
So for your own sake, say nothing
till we get to Valparaiso.

842
01:14:56,454 --> 01:14:58,524
Now, crawl out of here.

843
01:15:11,654 --> 01:15:14,373
Schlieter, you're doing all right.

844
01:15:14,894 --> 01:15:18,773
- I got a system.
- I heard about it.

845
01:15:19,414 --> 01:15:20,847
It works.

846
01:15:21,014 --> 01:15:25,212
Probably never be any love lost
between us, but I was wrong about you.

847
01:15:25,374 --> 01:15:27,763
You're doing a good job.

848
01:15:36,614 --> 01:15:38,411
Heinz!

849
01:15:44,174 --> 01:15:45,971
My heart...

850
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:49,773
You won't tell the captain?

851
01:15:49,974 --> 01:15:52,613
Well, I'm afraid I must.
You're not fit to be here.

852
01:15:52,814 --> 01:15:54,691
No, no, please.

853
01:15:55,014 --> 01:15:59,087
Down there, I'm only Heinz,
the cook's mate.

854
01:15:59,254 --> 01:16:01,927
Washing pots and pans.

855
01:16:02,894 --> 01:16:06,489
- Up here, I'm the lookout.
- And we all depend on you.

856
01:16:06,654 --> 01:16:10,647
- Yes, even Captain Ehrlich.
- Even the captain.

857
01:16:10,814 --> 01:16:13,965
- I'm important now.
- Yes, you are.

858
01:16:14,134 --> 01:16:17,729
But since we do depend on you,
you better get down and get some rest.

859
01:16:18,214 --> 01:16:23,083
Of course. Of course.
They'll need somebody always alert.

860
01:16:24,014 --> 01:16:26,972
Anyhow, I haven't missed everything.

861
01:16:27,134 --> 01:16:31,525
At least once, a beautiful lady
had her arm around me.

862
01:16:32,014 --> 01:16:34,926
Thank you, miss. Thank you.

863
01:16:42,694 --> 01:16:46,289
Napier, I looked at those charts again.
There are many, many islands.

864
01:16:46,454 --> 01:16:48,092
Needle-in-the-haystack stuff.

865
01:16:48,254 --> 01:16:52,372
The more I think about it, the more
certain I am he's gone to Pom Pom Galli.

866
01:16:52,854 --> 01:16:55,243
You may be right.
That's where we'll head for.

867
01:16:55,414 --> 01:16:56,972
Right, sir.

868
01:17:07,414 --> 01:17:10,770
Kruger tells me he has
a bearing on the <i>Rockhampton</i>.

869
01:17:10,934 --> 01:17:12,652
She's getting closer, chief.

870
01:17:12,814 --> 01:17:17,251
Captain, I've been going over my figures,
and with what wood we have cut...

871
01:17:17,414 --> 01:17:19,086
Wesser.

872
01:17:22,574 --> 01:17:24,451
Is he resting?

873
01:17:26,174 --> 01:17:28,324
Didn't you hear me?

874
01:17:29,694 --> 01:17:31,764
Is he resting?

875
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:35,245
What's it to you?
Do you wanna log it?

876
01:17:35,414 --> 01:17:37,644
You wanna make it look good
in your reports?

877
01:17:37,814 --> 01:17:39,566
You think of everything.

878
01:17:39,774 --> 01:17:42,493
Pulling the strings on all of us
like we're puppets.

879
01:17:42,654 --> 01:17:46,169
He's in there dying, understand?
You're getting your wood chopped.

880
01:17:46,374 --> 01:17:48,604
- You're gonna be a famous...
- Wesser...

881
01:17:52,694 --> 01:17:54,446
Nothing.

882
01:17:55,774 --> 01:17:57,048
You young fool!

883
01:17:57,214 --> 01:18:00,809
You know what the captain has been
doing for both you and Stemme?

884
01:18:00,974 --> 01:18:03,932
Making you sailors!
Trying to make men out of you!

885
01:18:04,094 --> 01:18:06,130
You realize how he feels
about Stemme?

886
01:18:06,334 --> 01:18:08,484
What he would do for Stemme
if he could?

887
01:18:08,654 --> 01:18:10,804
That boy isn't dying. He's dead!

888
01:18:10,974 --> 01:18:13,932
He's been dead since eight hours
after that shark bite.

889
01:18:14,134 --> 01:18:17,570
- When gangrene set in, he was...
- That'll do, chief.

890
01:18:18,134 --> 01:18:20,250
Wesser, go below.

891
01:18:32,774 --> 01:18:35,129
He's only a boy, captain.

892
01:18:35,614 --> 01:18:37,570
He was overwrought.

893
01:18:38,294 --> 01:18:41,411
- What he said...
- What he said was that...

894
01:18:41,574 --> 01:18:44,407
...I've been trying to play God.

895
01:18:46,254 --> 01:18:49,246
Perhaps he's right,
perhaps I have been.

896
01:18:49,454 --> 01:18:52,173
Working them, driving them,
starving them, for what?

897
01:18:52,334 --> 01:18:53,449
Integrity.

898
01:18:53,614 --> 01:18:57,163
Integrity or vanity?

899
01:18:57,334 --> 01:18:59,052
I don't know.

900
01:18:59,654 --> 01:19:02,726
- I'm gonna signal the <i>Rockhampton</i>.
- Why?

901
01:19:02,894 --> 01:19:07,092
If there was one chance in a million of
saving that boy, I would agree with you.

902
01:19:07,254 --> 01:19:10,087
But there isn't, and you know it!

903
01:19:10,254 --> 01:19:13,246
If you notify the <i>Rockhampton</i>
of our position...

904
01:19:13,694 --> 01:19:18,165
...it means every man, including Wesser,
will be stamped a war criminal.

905
01:19:18,774 --> 01:19:20,685
I tried to tell you before, captain.

906
01:19:20,854 --> 01:19:25,450
I'm fairly certain, if we clear the wood on
the beach, I can get you to Valparaiso.

907
01:19:25,614 --> 01:19:29,084
Don't make a decision tonight, captain.
Wait until morning.

908
01:19:33,214 --> 01:19:35,250
All right, chief.

909
01:20:49,174 --> 01:20:51,972
Prepare to get underway
in the morning.

910
01:20:58,414 --> 01:21:01,247
We'll bury him at sea.

911
01:21:32,374 --> 01:21:34,092
Bosun!

912
01:21:35,494 --> 01:21:37,803
Stop that work.
There will be no burial.

913
01:21:44,574 --> 01:21:48,647
Schlieter, take those men with you
and lower the boat again.

914
01:21:49,574 --> 01:21:50,848
Yes, sir.

915
01:21:51,014 --> 01:21:54,927
- That's the last boat.
- You heard the order, move.

916
01:21:57,214 --> 01:22:00,763
Captain, I've got Winkler and Heinz
on the boat deck.

917
01:22:02,454 --> 01:22:04,763
He can't mean that!

918
01:22:05,014 --> 01:22:06,811
I don't know.

919
01:22:19,614 --> 01:22:22,333
It'll mean medical attention
for you, Heinz.

920
01:22:22,494 --> 01:22:24,769
And you'll walk again.

921
01:22:25,214 --> 01:22:28,968
- I'm willing, sir.
- So am I, sir.

922
01:22:29,134 --> 01:22:32,763
I knew you would be.
Thank you both.

923
01:22:34,214 --> 01:22:36,409
Start heaving.

924
01:23:21,174 --> 01:23:22,448
That's their story, sir.

925
01:23:22,614 --> 01:23:25,128
They were carrying a charge
of explosives.

926
01:23:25,294 --> 01:23:27,967
When they hit the reef,
it blew the keel wide open.

927
01:23:32,174 --> 01:23:33,732
They had only one lifeboat.

928
01:23:33,894 --> 01:23:38,092
Ehrlich got some of the injured into it,
and then there was a second explosion.

929
01:23:38,574 --> 01:23:40,804
Anything to say about
the Auckland murders?

930
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,453
They denied it, of course.

931
01:23:42,614 --> 01:23:45,686
- Have the surgeon take a look at them.
- Right, sir.

932
01:23:48,294 --> 01:23:51,331
<i>When a search disclosed no wreckage</i>
<i>or other survivors...</i>

933
01:23:51,494 --> 01:23:53,485
<i>... we knew he'd slipped</i>
<i>from our grasp.</i>

934
01:23:53,654 --> 01:23:56,532
<i>The</i> Ergenstrasse<i>,</i>
<i>that tired old woman of the sea...</i>

935
01:23:56,694 --> 01:24:00,653
<i>... had gained the slight margin of time</i>
<i>necessary to reach Valparaiso.</i>

936
01:24:00,814 --> 01:24:03,612
<i>She was fast becoming</i>
<i>an international heroine...</i>

937
01:24:03,774 --> 01:24:07,210
<i>... and German propaganda</i>
<i>was smothering the Auckland incident...</i>

938
01:24:07,374 --> 01:24:09,251
<i>... to make a legend of her.</i>

939
01:24:49,494 --> 01:24:51,962
Make her fast where she is.

940
01:24:56,574 --> 01:25:00,283
Tell Mr. Kirchner to wait in
the mess room until I've seen the consul.

941
01:25:00,454 --> 01:25:01,933
Yes, sir.

942
01:25:03,094 --> 01:25:05,050
The consul's in your cabin, sir.

943
01:25:05,214 --> 01:25:08,092
I'll see the port authorities
after I've talked to him.

944
01:25:08,254 --> 01:25:09,812
Yes, sir.

945
01:25:15,934 --> 01:25:18,573
Elsa, I wanna talk to you
before we go ashore.

946
01:25:18,734 --> 01:25:20,884
About this great glory you've won?

947
01:25:21,054 --> 01:25:22,646
Well, it's all yours.

948
01:25:22,814 --> 01:25:24,532
Enjoy it.

949
01:25:24,694 --> 01:25:26,889
But enjoy it alone.

950
01:25:36,334 --> 01:25:37,562
Hepke, consul general.

951
01:25:37,734 --> 01:25:40,123
Ehrlich, you've established
a great tradition.

952
01:25:40,294 --> 01:25:42,728
Thank you, consul general.
Have a chair.

953
01:25:42,894 --> 01:25:45,852
An accomplishment to be written
in the annals of the sea.

954
01:25:46,014 --> 01:25:49,450
- The voyage isn't completed yet, sir.
- You achieved your purpose.

955
01:25:49,614 --> 01:25:52,003
To risk capture again
might destroy everything.

956
01:25:52,174 --> 01:25:56,770
You are proof that the great
Royal Navy is not, after all, invincible.

957
01:25:56,934 --> 01:26:01,166
Now, give me the straight story on this
propaganda the British are putting out...

958
01:26:01,334 --> 01:26:03,768
...those so-called murders
at Auckland Island.

959
01:26:03,974 --> 01:26:05,805
It's not propaganda.

960
01:26:05,974 --> 01:26:08,408
They were murders.
There's the proof.

961
01:26:08,614 --> 01:26:12,368
I prefer to believe they were armed
belligerents erecting a wireless station.

962
01:26:12,534 --> 01:26:14,525
That they were killed
in open combat.

963
01:26:14,694 --> 01:26:18,209
The first land action in the Pacific,
and a gallant victory for us.

964
01:26:18,374 --> 01:26:22,128
That story, with the news of your arrival,
has flashed around the world.

965
01:26:22,654 --> 01:26:26,772
By what right do you compound murder
with a bald-faced lie?

966
01:26:26,934 --> 01:26:30,813
By whose authority do you compromise
this ship and my personal honor?

967
01:26:32,214 --> 01:26:35,206
Think of your crew.
Haven't they a right to a good name?

968
01:26:35,414 --> 01:26:37,325
I intend they'll keep that right...

969
01:26:37,494 --> 01:26:40,531
...not have it dragged through the mud
for one man's crime.

970
01:26:40,694 --> 01:26:45,165
I plan to take the man responsible,
my chief officer, Mr. Kirchner...

971
01:26:45,334 --> 01:26:48,724
...before a naval court-martial
as soon as we're home.

972
01:26:48,934 --> 01:26:51,528
That's your privilege,
and it's quite correct...

973
01:26:51,694 --> 01:26:53,605
...but for the sake of our country...

974
01:26:53,774 --> 01:26:57,369
...let's not air our dirty linen here,
before an often hostile press.

975
01:26:57,534 --> 01:26:59,684
What do you suggest that I do?

976
01:26:59,854 --> 01:27:03,164
The <i>Rockhampton</i> is due in Valparaiso
tomorrow. You can't leave.

977
01:27:03,334 --> 01:27:05,564
I'll take my chances with the British.

978
01:27:05,734 --> 01:27:09,443
They won't waste a warship
watching this harbor for long.

979
01:27:10,174 --> 01:27:12,290
Very well, captain, if you insist.

980
01:27:12,454 --> 01:27:16,129
Seamanship is your forte. But I beg
to remind you, propaganda is mine.

981
01:27:16,294 --> 01:27:19,331
- Lf I assist you, you must help me.
- I won't lie for you.

982
01:27:19,494 --> 01:27:23,885
I wouldn't think of asking you to lie.
You haven't had the diplomatic training.

983
01:27:24,054 --> 01:27:26,045
Just let me handle the press releases.

984
01:27:26,214 --> 01:27:29,889
In exchange, I'll get you your clearance
papers, everything you need.

985
01:27:30,054 --> 01:27:32,966
Kirchner will ask for a passport
and passage home.

986
01:27:33,134 --> 01:27:35,648
I insist that he return
on this ship with me.

987
01:27:35,814 --> 01:27:38,533
If that's your wish, of course, captain.

988
01:27:38,694 --> 01:27:42,528
Don't forget, tomorrow you'll be guest
of honor at a banquet, Hotel Astur.

989
01:27:42,694 --> 01:27:46,687
I've arranged quarters for you there,
and my aides will be at your disposal.

990
01:27:46,854 --> 01:27:49,163
So for now, good day, captain.

991
01:27:49,894 --> 01:27:51,532
Good day.

992
01:28:12,134 --> 01:28:17,447
Must have been exciting, one woman
on a ship, alone, with so many men.

993
01:28:18,814 --> 01:28:21,567
Especially with the great
Captain Ehrlich.

994
01:28:22,654 --> 01:28:25,532
- He is so, so...
- I know.

995
01:28:35,134 --> 01:28:36,931
Good evening.

996
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,850
- How perfect.
- Thank you.

997
01:28:41,014 --> 01:28:44,165
You know, for once,
I'm actually sorry for Ehrlich.

998
01:28:45,414 --> 01:28:48,565
Why? After all, he's achieved
everything he's wanted.

999
01:28:48,734 --> 01:28:51,407
Well, every man to his own desires.

1000
01:28:52,734 --> 01:28:55,123
- Where are we dining?
- A little caf.

1001
01:28:55,294 --> 01:28:57,489
- Do they have music?
- Oh, yes.

1002
01:28:57,654 --> 01:29:01,329
- Exciting?
- With you, yes.

1003
01:29:09,094 --> 01:29:10,652
Stand up straight, please.

1004
01:29:10,814 --> 01:29:12,930
Lean closer, please.

1005
01:29:13,174 --> 01:29:16,325
Easy, man.
She's enough for both of us.

1006
01:29:17,014 --> 01:29:20,051
- Take another picture.
- Thank you.

1007
01:29:21,414 --> 01:29:23,848
Here comes our captain now.

1008
01:29:36,534 --> 01:29:40,243
- Tell us how you evaded the English.
- No, Auckland Island, captain.

1009
01:29:40,414 --> 01:29:42,166
Now, I've covered that for you.

1010
01:29:42,334 --> 01:29:45,770
Have your pictures, but the captain's
too weary to be interviewed.

1011
01:29:45,934 --> 01:29:48,892
- Even about Auckland Island?
- Take your pictures, sir.

1012
01:29:49,054 --> 01:29:50,373
All right.

1013
01:30:07,814 --> 01:30:11,363
Again we must emphasize,
photographs, but no interviews.

1014
01:30:14,174 --> 01:30:16,813
It's been a long chase, Karl.

1015
01:30:17,054 --> 01:30:19,693
I wish I could say
it had been a good one.

1016
01:30:20,654 --> 01:30:25,091
All I care to hear is a retraction of these
German lies about Auckland Island.

1017
01:30:26,174 --> 01:30:28,688
Do you say those men were armed?

1018
01:30:29,174 --> 01:30:33,167
Do you say they were building a
military wireless on a shipwreck station?

1019
01:30:33,334 --> 01:30:38,169
Do you say they opened fire, these
helpless, unarmed men I found dead?

1020
01:30:38,574 --> 01:30:39,643
Do you?

1021
01:30:39,814 --> 01:30:41,930
You were in command
of that shore party.

1022
01:30:42,094 --> 01:30:44,767
- And you were the last to leave.
- British lies.

1023
01:30:44,934 --> 01:30:46,367
Not from Jeff Napier.

1024
01:30:46,574 --> 01:30:48,132
Do you?

1025
01:30:51,374 --> 01:30:55,606
Whatever my ship is charged with,
I am charged with.

1026
01:30:55,774 --> 01:30:59,653
The truth is set down in my log
for you or anyone else to read...

1027
01:30:59,814 --> 01:31:02,169
...the day you take my ship.

1028
01:31:03,214 --> 01:31:06,889
I never wanted to believe
you sanctioned those murders...

1029
01:31:07,374 --> 01:31:09,888
...but now I call you what you are:

1030
01:31:10,054 --> 01:31:14,332
A murderer, a liar and a coward!

1031
01:31:14,494 --> 01:31:17,566
Napier! You're forgetting
who and where you are.

1032
01:31:17,734 --> 01:31:19,531
Wait outside.

1033
01:31:23,334 --> 01:31:26,610
Captain Ehrlich, the <i>Rockhampton</i>
will be waiting for you.

1034
01:31:26,774 --> 01:31:30,608
Nothing would give me greater pleasure
than to have you attempt to leave.

1035
01:31:30,774 --> 01:31:32,332
Good night, sir.

1036
01:31:34,294 --> 01:31:38,048
- Elsa, please.
- Don't touch me!

1037
01:31:39,294 --> 01:31:42,604
The English are bad losers
and flaunters of international law.

1038
01:31:42,774 --> 01:31:45,652
Proceed with the banquet.
I'll join you later.

1039
01:31:45,814 --> 01:31:48,886
I'll soon have a statement ready
on this barbaric incident.

1040
01:31:49,054 --> 01:31:51,363
- Get the people to the banquet.
- Yes, sir.

1041
01:31:51,534 --> 01:31:53,126
Captain.

1042
01:32:08,974 --> 01:32:12,933
Your restraint was admirable, captain.
The courage of silence.

1043
01:32:13,094 --> 01:32:15,972
It made the English appear
all the more the aggressors.

1044
01:32:16,134 --> 01:32:17,726
Get out.

1045
01:32:18,654 --> 01:32:20,372
Oh, this has upset you.

1046
01:32:20,534 --> 01:32:25,483
- You shouldn't be alone.
- Perhaps not, but I can do without you.

1047
01:32:25,974 --> 01:32:29,444
You're tired. I'll see you
after you've had some rest.

1048
01:32:48,974 --> 01:32:50,965
- <i>Operator.</i>
- Miss Keller's room, please.

1049
01:32:51,134 --> 01:32:52,806
<i>One moment, please.</i>

1050
01:32:54,014 --> 01:32:56,005
- She's not?
- <i>Shall I try later?</i>

1051
01:32:56,174 --> 01:32:58,893
- Did she leave word where she'd be?
- <i>I'm sorry, sir.</i>

1052
01:32:59,054 --> 01:33:00,965
- <i>Shall I try later?</i>
- Thank you.

1053
01:33:01,134 --> 01:33:02,772
<i>Thank you.</i>

1054
01:33:13,494 --> 01:33:14,973
Elsa.

1055
01:33:18,574 --> 01:33:20,485
Oh, Karl!

1056
01:33:30,694 --> 01:33:35,722
That night aboard the ship,
I told you my way of thinking.

1057
01:33:36,534 --> 01:33:39,446
Yet I didn't tell you
the complete truth...

1058
01:33:40,254 --> 01:33:43,326
...because I never even
admitted it to myself.

1059
01:33:44,694 --> 01:33:46,650
Still, it was there.

1060
01:33:47,374 --> 01:33:50,571
You had your illusions and ideals.

1061
01:33:51,374 --> 01:33:53,968
I never had any illusions...

1062
01:33:54,654 --> 01:33:56,849
...but I had an ideal.

1063
01:33:58,694 --> 01:34:01,162
I've known many men, Karl.

1064
01:34:01,934 --> 01:34:04,050
I won't deny that.

1065
01:34:04,694 --> 01:34:09,643
But I never thought I would meet one
that I could be proud of.

1066
01:34:11,214 --> 01:34:13,444
Now I've found him.

1067
01:34:14,574 --> 01:34:19,853
Don't confuse sincerity of purpose
with success.

1068
01:34:20,694 --> 01:34:24,846
There's still 15,000 miles
to the flag stead light.

1069
01:34:25,014 --> 01:34:27,448
That's what I'm trying
to tell you, darling.

1070
01:34:27,614 --> 01:34:30,572
The consul has orders
that I should stay here.

1071
01:34:30,734 --> 01:34:32,964
But why must you try to go on?

1072
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:35,125
You've done the impossible.

1073
01:34:35,294 --> 01:34:40,163
No one would think less of you now
if you accepted internment.

1074
01:34:40,774 --> 01:34:43,288
Oh, please, Karl, give it up.

1075
01:34:46,694 --> 01:34:48,366
Elsa...

1076
01:34:49,254 --> 01:34:51,245
...you call it an illusion.

1077
01:34:51,414 --> 01:34:55,123
Perhaps it is, but it's part of me.

1078
01:34:55,294 --> 01:34:59,048
I may fail, but I can't quit.

1079
01:35:01,094 --> 01:35:02,812
Hold me.

1080
01:35:04,494 --> 01:35:06,246
Tell me.

1081
01:35:07,894 --> 01:35:09,532
Tell me.

1082
01:35:11,454 --> 01:35:13,649
I love you.

1083
01:35:23,334 --> 01:35:25,643
With the scarcity of shipping
in this area...

1084
01:35:25,814 --> 01:35:28,851
...I don't think we can get in trouble
until we reach here.

1085
01:35:29,014 --> 01:35:31,369
You've said nothing about Elsa.

1086
01:35:32,094 --> 01:35:34,813
Elsa remains ashore.
How about supplies?

1087
01:35:34,974 --> 01:35:37,966
Everything's onboard, sir,
including ample fuel.

1088
01:35:38,134 --> 01:35:41,444
- Of course, our main worry...
- Is the men.

1089
01:35:41,614 --> 01:35:45,163
Some of them won't return to the ship,
and I can't say I blame them.

1090
01:35:45,334 --> 01:35:46,608
They'll all be here, sir.

1091
01:35:46,774 --> 01:35:49,242
- Everybody's onboard, sir.
- Everybody, sir.

1092
01:35:49,414 --> 01:35:53,009
Good. Thank them for me, will you?

1093
01:35:53,174 --> 01:35:55,483
No, I'll go below
and thank them myself.

1094
01:35:55,694 --> 01:35:57,525
- Captain.
- We've got a problem, sir.

1095
01:35:57,694 --> 01:35:59,207
- Trouble ashore?
- Yes, sir.

1096
01:35:59,374 --> 01:36:03,287
Last night we're in the bars and we
run up against some British sailors.

1097
01:36:03,454 --> 01:36:04,728
- A fight?
- No, sir.

1098
01:36:04,894 --> 01:36:06,805
- They seemed decent.
- A lot like us.

1099
01:36:06,974 --> 01:36:08,805
So we decided to have a contest.

1100
01:36:08,974 --> 01:36:10,566
- Drinking?
- Well, sort of, sir.

1101
01:36:10,734 --> 01:36:12,725
They promised to bring us back, sir.

1102
01:36:12,894 --> 01:36:14,850
And that's the last thing I remember.

1103
01:36:15,014 --> 01:36:16,493
But the problem is, sir:

1104
01:36:16,654 --> 01:36:19,532
How do you get rid of a tattoo?

1105
01:36:20,174 --> 01:36:23,291
- Looks like it's been there a long time.
- Not that one, sir.

1106
01:36:23,454 --> 01:36:25,285
Turn around.

1107
01:36:28,974 --> 01:36:30,123
This one, sir.

1108
01:36:32,374 --> 01:36:35,491
"Britannia rules the waves."

1109
01:36:37,334 --> 01:36:39,768
<i>We maintained our blockade</i>
<i>at the harbor...</i>

1110
01:36:39,934 --> 01:36:43,449
<i>... and no cat ever watched</i>
<i>a mouse hole more intently.</i>

1111
01:36:43,614 --> 01:36:46,082
<i>Would Ehrlich chance it</i>
<i>or wouldn 't he?</i>

1112
01:36:46,254 --> 01:36:48,484
<i>It was becoming</i>
<i>an international thriller...</i>

1113
01:36:48,654 --> 01:36:52,010
<i>... with sympathy running,</i>
<i>as it always does, to the underdog.</i>

1114
01:36:52,214 --> 01:36:55,251
<i>And the dog</i>
<i>was about to have his day.</i>

1115
01:36:55,414 --> 01:36:56,813
Number One!

1116
01:36:56,974 --> 01:36:59,852
- Sir?
- We're going to have more exciting duty.

1117
01:37:00,014 --> 01:37:03,893
Our cruisers <i>Ajax</i>, <i>Achilles</i> and <i>Exeter</i>
are in action off of Uruguay...

1118
01:37:04,054 --> 01:37:07,524
...against the <i>Graf Spee</i>.
We are ordered to proceed at once.

1119
01:37:07,694 --> 01:37:09,332
What about the <i>Ergenstrasse</i>?

1120
01:37:09,814 --> 01:37:14,171
Where's your sense of proportion, man?
A battleship is worth 10 tramp steamers.

1121
01:37:14,334 --> 01:37:16,086
Yes, but not 10 Ehrlichs, sir.

1122
01:37:16,254 --> 01:37:19,963
Napier, you're making this altogether
too much of a personal vendetta.

1123
01:37:20,134 --> 01:37:23,046
Then perhaps you'd endorse
my request for a transfer...

1124
01:37:23,214 --> 01:37:25,011
...to the North Sea patrol.

1125
01:37:25,174 --> 01:37:28,723
- He's gotta come through there.
- I'll see that you are accommodated.

1126
01:37:28,894 --> 01:37:32,125
Now, if you don't mind,
I have my ship to look after.

1127
01:37:42,174 --> 01:37:46,133
The lights of Valparaiso
are still astern, Mr. Bachman.

1128
01:37:47,094 --> 01:37:50,723
Any further instructions
for the night-order book, sir?

1129
01:37:50,894 --> 01:37:54,807
No further instructions
for the night-order book, Mr. Kirchner.

1130
01:37:54,974 --> 01:37:57,966
Just keep to your quarters
when not on duty.

1131
01:38:21,334 --> 01:38:23,325
No premonition this time?

1132
01:38:27,534 --> 01:38:29,650
For better or for worse.

1133
01:38:34,614 --> 01:38:37,333
<i>While the</i> Rockhampton <i>headed</i>
<i>for the</i> Graf Spee...

1134
01:38:37,494 --> 01:38:40,167
<i>... I was in an airplane</i>
<i>bound for England.</i>

1135
01:38:40,334 --> 01:38:42,973
<i>But Karl Ehrlich,</i>
<i>through the fortunes of war...</i>

1136
01:38:43,134 --> 01:38:45,523
<i>... had once more gained valuable time.</i>

1137
01:38:45,694 --> 01:38:47,924
<i>He was still beating the sea and us.</i>

1138
01:38:48,094 --> 01:38:52,053
<i>Still sailing homeward</i>
<i>against almost impossible odds.</i>

1139
01:38:52,214 --> 01:38:55,570
<i>His obsession had made a new crew</i>
<i>of the men of the</i> Ergenstrasse.

1140
01:38:55,734 --> 01:38:59,852
<i>And in spite of my hatred for the man,</i>
<i>I felt a certain ironic admiration...</i>

1141
01:39:00,014 --> 01:39:03,529
<i>... for the captain who had welded</i>
<i>the steel of his own character...</i>

1142
01:39:03,694 --> 01:39:06,162
<i>... into that plodding heap</i>
<i>of scrap iron.</i>

1143
01:39:06,854 --> 01:39:09,891
<i>Fed and rested,</i>
<i>she beat her way up the Atlantic.</i>

1144
01:39:10,054 --> 01:39:14,013
<i>Her belly was full now of all</i>
<i>necessary coal and provisions...</i>

1145
01:39:14,174 --> 01:39:17,211
<i>... and new lifeboats</i>
<i>hung from her davits.</i>

1146
01:39:17,374 --> 01:39:21,083
<i>The storms threatened her,</i>
<i>yet in a way they aided her...</i>

1147
01:39:21,254 --> 01:39:23,893
<i>... by hiding her in their turbulence.</i>

1148
01:39:24,134 --> 01:39:26,932
<i>A little ship unnoticed</i>
<i>in a big ocean...</i>

1149
01:39:27,094 --> 01:39:30,973
<i>... battling and staggering</i>
<i>under the fury of the elements.</i>

1150
01:39:35,974 --> 01:39:40,126
<i>As I waited for her in the North Sea</i>
<i>at the crossroads of the war...</i>

1151
01:39:40,294 --> 01:39:44,526
<i>... I hoped desperately that no other force</i>
<i>would rob me of my quarry.</i>

1152
01:39:44,734 --> 01:39:47,692
<i>And I was alert day and night</i>
<i>for any report...</i>

1153
01:39:47,854 --> 01:39:50,687
<i>... which might be received in London.</i>

1154
01:39:52,654 --> 01:39:54,053
<i>This is Berlin calling...</i>

1155
01:39:54,214 --> 01:39:58,366
<i>... and here again is Lord Haw-Haw at the</i>
<i>microphone of our shortwave station...</i>

1156
01:39:58,534 --> 01:40:00,286
<i>... speaking to England.</i>

1157
01:40:00,454 --> 01:40:03,764
<i>We've all heard of the</i> Ergenstrasse <i>'s</i>
<i>game of hide-and-seek...</i>

1158
01:40:03,934 --> 01:40:05,526
<i>... with the Royal Navy.</i>

1159
01:40:05,694 --> 01:40:09,926
<i>It's been most amusing to report the</i>
<i>bungling British attempts to capture her.</i>

1160
01:40:10,094 --> 01:40:12,767
<i>We're therefore going to lend them</i>
<i>a helping hand.</i>

1161
01:40:12,934 --> 01:40:17,052
<i>Some enlightening clues to the evasive</i>
Ergenstrasse <i>'s whereabouts.</i>

1162
01:40:17,214 --> 01:40:20,524
<i>Of course, from their former record,</i>
<i>it'll do them little good.</i>

1163
01:40:20,694 --> 01:40:22,810
<i>Are you ready, admiralty?</i>

1164
01:40:23,014 --> 01:40:26,609
<i>The</i> Ergenstrasse <i>is now proceeding</i>
<i>along the coast of Norway...</i>

1165
01:40:26,774 --> 01:40:29,493
<i>... at a present speed</i>
<i>of about 5 knots.</i>

1166
01:40:29,654 --> 01:40:34,011
<i>At this moment, she should be</i>
<i>off the mouth of Korsfjord.</i>

1167
01:40:38,774 --> 01:40:40,571
Captain!

1168
01:40:45,894 --> 01:40:49,170
<i>The Nazis had made a decoy</i>
<i>of the</i> Ergenstrasse.

1169
01:40:49,334 --> 01:40:51,564
<i>Karl Ehrlich, on the brink</i>
<i>of fulfillment...</i>

1170
01:40:51,734 --> 01:40:55,613
<i>... had been betrayed by the new party</i>
<i>to which everything was expendable.</i>

1171
01:40:55,774 --> 01:40:58,527
<i>It must have been a shock,</i>
<i>but no surprise to him...</i>

1172
01:40:58,694 --> 01:41:01,128
<i>... because it didn 't alter</i>
<i>his determination.</i>

1173
01:41:01,294 --> 01:41:04,331
Tell the engine room to cut down
on the smoke, Mr. Bachman.

1174
01:41:04,494 --> 01:41:06,007
Aye, aye, sir.

1175
01:41:06,214 --> 01:41:09,968
Yes, I've read that monitored report
of Lord Haw-Haw's broadcast.

1176
01:41:10,134 --> 01:41:12,364
They're inviting us
to send out heavy ships.

1177
01:41:12,534 --> 01:41:14,650
Ships that we need badly.

1178
01:41:14,814 --> 01:41:17,328
Give their air force a field day.

1179
01:41:17,494 --> 01:41:21,806
- A stupid invitation we won't accept.
- Thank you, sir.

1180
01:41:21,974 --> 01:41:24,852
I know I'm violating procedure,
coming directly to you...

1181
01:41:25,014 --> 01:41:27,892
...but this has become an issue
that I can't put aside.

1182
01:41:28,054 --> 01:41:29,851
How does your crew feel about it?

1183
01:41:30,014 --> 01:41:33,051
Same as I do, sir.
They're all volunteers.

1184
01:41:33,894 --> 01:41:38,251
If I consent, where do you propose
intercepting your friend?

1185
01:41:38,974 --> 01:41:40,851
Thank you, sir.

1186
01:41:44,654 --> 01:41:47,851
I believe somewhere in here.

1187
01:42:03,454 --> 01:42:07,447
Elsa, how long
have we known each other?

1188
01:42:07,614 --> 01:42:10,367
I've known you since that day
on the island.

1189
01:42:10,534 --> 01:42:14,686
When I was driving this crew
24 hours a day?

1190
01:42:14,974 --> 01:42:16,885
At the grave.

1191
01:42:18,374 --> 01:42:20,808
That's a long time ago.

1192
01:42:21,094 --> 01:42:25,451
When you said,
"They were good men. Seamen."

1193
01:42:26,014 --> 01:42:28,130
That they were.

1194
01:42:28,854 --> 01:42:32,324
Well, it's a poor reward,
a forgotten grave.

1195
01:42:32,494 --> 01:42:34,371
Not forgotten.

1196
01:42:34,534 --> 01:42:37,810
Immortality has nothing
to do with fame.

1197
01:42:37,974 --> 01:42:41,887
Come on outside,
I have a present for you.

1198
01:42:55,454 --> 01:42:57,922
That's the Norwegian coast.

1199
01:42:58,494 --> 01:43:01,645
Karl, you've kept another promise.

1200
01:43:01,814 --> 01:43:05,204
Perhaps your greatest.
You brought your men home.

1201
01:43:05,374 --> 01:43:09,845
- And to all that it means to them.
- And all that it means to them.

1202
01:43:11,054 --> 01:43:13,443
We'd better get out of the weather.

1203
01:43:22,534 --> 01:43:25,492
It means happiness and home
for everyone else onboard...

1204
01:43:25,654 --> 01:43:27,087
...but what about us?

1205
01:43:27,254 --> 01:43:30,690
What about you?
Arrest, imprisonment?

1206
01:43:30,854 --> 01:43:33,527
Probably. But we'll face that
when we come to it.

1207
01:43:33,694 --> 01:43:36,970
Let's face it now.
This is a neutral coast.

1208
01:43:37,134 --> 01:43:39,887
Why can't we land here
and let the men go on?

1209
01:43:40,054 --> 01:43:42,614
Elsa, you're asking the captain
to leave his ship?

1210
01:43:42,774 --> 01:43:45,208
Captain! Captain!

1211
01:43:47,614 --> 01:43:51,448
Ship off the starboard quarter, sir,
showing no lights.

1212
01:44:05,254 --> 01:44:08,212
Bearing red 10, sir.

1213
01:44:14,374 --> 01:44:15,966
Put a shot across her bows.

1214
01:44:16,534 --> 01:44:18,013
Let this go over her.

1215
01:44:25,334 --> 01:44:27,370
Stop engine.

1216
01:44:29,894 --> 01:44:32,931
Pass the word to abandon ship.

1217
01:44:34,614 --> 01:44:36,286
Move!

1218
01:44:44,414 --> 01:44:47,167
- <i>Engine room.</i>
- Schmitt, we will follow the plan.

1219
01:44:54,454 --> 01:44:56,649
Everybody out!

1220
01:44:57,094 --> 01:44:59,324
Clear the bridge.

1221
01:45:00,454 --> 01:45:02,729
When she loses steerageway,
get to the boat.

1222
01:45:02,894 --> 01:45:04,009
Aye, aye, sir.

1223
01:45:14,094 --> 01:45:16,528
She's losing headway, sir.

1224
01:45:17,094 --> 01:45:20,450
Lot of activity on the boat deck.
Might be some sort of trick.

1225
01:45:20,614 --> 01:45:22,650
Well, we'll see.

1226
01:45:25,054 --> 01:45:30,174
Elsa, this is our log.
Make sure it gets to Jeff Napier.

1227
01:45:30,334 --> 01:45:32,609
Schlieter! Hang onto this
for Miss Keller.

1228
01:45:32,774 --> 01:45:35,811
But aren't you coming
on the same boat?

1229
01:45:36,014 --> 01:45:37,766
No.

1230
01:45:39,734 --> 01:45:43,443
- Everything rigged below?
- Yes, but I'm staying with you.

1231
01:45:43,654 --> 01:45:46,930
Chief, I promised you
your grandchildren. Get in that boat.

1232
01:45:47,094 --> 01:45:49,403
- But...
- That's an order!

1233
01:45:49,894 --> 01:45:51,964
All right, everyone aboard!

1234
01:45:56,494 --> 01:45:59,964
Mr. Kirchner, report to the bridge.

1235
01:46:11,414 --> 01:46:13,769
Kirchner, you're staying
aboard with me.

1236
01:46:13,934 --> 01:46:16,164
- What?
- You're such a loyal party member...

1237
01:46:16,334 --> 01:46:19,132
...you'll fight for your cause,
while I defend my ship.

1238
01:46:19,294 --> 01:46:20,966
Your ship? You're a lunatic!

1239
01:46:21,134 --> 01:46:23,125
You have no crew,
no armament, no guns.

1240
01:46:23,294 --> 01:46:26,764
- But a propeller. One.
- Now...

1241
01:46:44,534 --> 01:46:46,843
There's no activity onboard
at all now, sir.

1242
01:46:47,014 --> 01:46:48,606
Boats are approaching us, sir.

1243
01:47:01,734 --> 01:47:04,771
Are we going to pick them up?
I don't like the look of it.

1244
01:47:05,054 --> 01:47:08,012
Throw a net over the side.
Prepare to take them onboard.

1245
01:47:08,174 --> 01:47:10,927
- Yes, sir.
- Bring the captain to me.

1246
01:48:11,454 --> 01:48:14,605
Here's our log.
Take it to your captain.

1247
01:48:21,734 --> 01:48:24,851
We have the survivors onboard.
The captain isn't with them.

1248
01:48:25,014 --> 01:48:26,686
This is their log.

1249
01:48:28,214 --> 01:48:30,364
They're changing course, sir.

1250
01:48:31,414 --> 01:48:33,882
Shall we commence firing, sir?

1251
01:48:34,054 --> 01:48:37,364
- No. Put a star shell over her.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1252
01:48:37,534 --> 01:48:40,128
Put a star shell over her!

1253
01:49:00,614 --> 01:49:02,445
He's making a hoist
from the bridge.

1254
01:49:02,614 --> 01:49:07,051
- What flag is that? It has no swastika.
- The imperial battle flag.

1255
01:49:07,214 --> 01:49:10,365
- He can't be going to engage us, sir?
- He is.

1256
01:49:10,534 --> 01:49:12,604
I think he's gonna try and ram us, sir.

1257
01:49:12,774 --> 01:49:15,413
- Commence firing.
- Aye, aye, sir.

1258
01:49:17,294 --> 01:49:19,649
Commence firing!

1259
01:49:25,134 --> 01:49:27,773
- Up 200.
- Up 200.

1260
01:49:35,414 --> 01:49:37,484
Hit on the well deck, sir.

1261
01:49:50,494 --> 01:49:51,973
Hit on the boat deck, sir.

1262
01:50:05,014 --> 01:50:07,084
You maniac!

1263
01:50:12,334 --> 01:50:16,088
Elsa. Strike that flag!

1264
01:50:35,694 --> 01:50:38,367
Elsa, the lifeboat.

1265
01:50:46,134 --> 01:50:48,568
The boilers are gone, sir.

1266
01:50:54,814 --> 01:50:56,850
Cease fire.

1267
01:50:57,894 --> 01:50:59,009
Cease fire.

1268
01:51:04,294 --> 01:51:08,845
Shall we break radio silence, sir?
Report the taking of the <i>Ergenstrasse</i>?

1269
01:51:11,294 --> 01:51:12,932
No.

1270
01:51:13,734 --> 01:51:16,168
I'll report this in person.

1271
01:51:20,214 --> 01:51:22,728
We'll search for survivors.

1272
01:51:23,454 --> 01:51:26,491
- Slow ahead.
- Slow ahead, sir.

1273
01:51:30,694 --> 01:51:32,332
<i>We searched for survivors...</i>

1274
01:51:32,494 --> 01:51:35,645
<i>... but all that we found</i>
<i>was a riddle of the sea...</i>

1275
01:51:35,814 --> 01:51:39,329
<i>... some tide-swept wreckage</i>
<i>on the nearby beach.</i>

1276
01:51:39,494 --> 01:51:41,689
<i>Had the sea taken them...</i>

1277
01:51:41,854 --> 01:51:46,450
<i>... or had they reached the nearby shore</i>
<i>where the fjords could hide a secret?</i>

1278
01:51:46,614 --> 01:51:48,445
<i>Who can say?</i>

1279
01:51:48,694 --> 01:51:52,403
<i>There are only two people who can</i>
<i>answer that, wherever they are.</i>

1280
01:51:52,574 --> 01:51:57,284
<i>But knowing Karl Ehrlich as I did,</i>
<i>I have my own opinion.</i>

1281
