1
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:23,272
(theme music playing)

2
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:59,928
- (elevator dings)
- (doors open)

3
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:04,057
"And the people went their ways,
each to his own ship.

4
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,394
Then bethought them of the blessed
boon of sleep;

5
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:11,481
But Achilles still wept for thinking
of his dear comrade,

6
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:14,985
And sleep, before whom
all things bow,

7
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:17,279
Could take
no hold upon him.

8
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:19,531
This way
and that did he turn

9
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,658
As he thought of all
they had done together,

10
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:24,244
And all
they had gone through"...

11
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:27,706
hey, you're not
listening to me.

12
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,167
Oh, no, sure we are.

13
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:33,629
"...thought of all
they had done together,

14
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:36,006
And all they had
gone through

15
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,508
Both on the fields
of battle

16
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,137
And the waves
of the weary seas."

17
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,974
How about
a comic, Amos?

18
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:49,811
I've got "Snookums,"
"Phantom, "Blondie."

19
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:52,397
- (door opens)
- What's your favorite?

20
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:55,442
- The Japs surrendered.
- Man: What?

21
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:57,486
- What did he say?
- The war is over.

22
00:03:57,654 --> 00:03:59,279
Man #2:
Did you hear that?

23
00:03:59,447 --> 00:04:01,114
Definite.
On the radio.

24
00:04:01,282 --> 00:04:04,117
- Man #3: The war's over!
- The war's over.

25
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,911
- It's over.
- (people chatting)

26
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:08,413
- It's over.
- (elevator dings)

27
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:10,165
(people laughing)

28
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,334
- Can you believe it?
- Yes!

29
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,002
(people cheering)

30
00:04:16,464 --> 00:04:20,008
- Man: It's over! It's over!
- (crying)

31
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,810
- (booms)
- (men cheering)

32
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,354
- (music playing)
- Man: I need a drink!

33
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,656
- Man #2: What do you got?
- Come on now.

34
00:04:42,824 --> 00:04:46,201
- Here, open wide.
- You're wasting it.

35
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,962
You see that?
Line of stars angling up?

36
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:59,715
- Yup.
- That's Snafu's pecker.

37
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:03,051
- (gun fires)
- Hey, boys.

38
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:07,889
You've got a nice little party going on
down there, Lieutenant.

39
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:11,476
Ah. A little
victory party.

40
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,314
Can't believe
it's over, huh?

41
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:19,735
Sort of a "What do
you do now?"

42
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:25,073
Here.

43
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,995
Have a little V-J Day
party of your own.

44
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:35,667
Thanks, Lieutenant.

45
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,426
"What do
we do now?"

46
00:05:46,262 --> 00:05:48,930
What an idiot.

47
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:53,101
Well, I'll show you
what I'm doing now.

48
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,196
Well, there it is:

49
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:06,907
My first official act
of peacetime.

50
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,284
Snaf.

51
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,806
- (birds chirping)
- (dog barking)

52
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,248
- Jesus. Nothing's changed.
- (coins clink)

53
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,500
Man: I thought the same thing
when I got back.

54
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,002
Funny. Here.

55
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,672
There. You can
keep the change.

56
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,258
I ain't touching that.
I might've jumped into Normandy,

57
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,635
but at least I got some liberties
in London and Paris.

58
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:13,640
You Gl-rines, you got nothing
but jungle rot and malaria.

59
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:15,684
Welcome home.

60
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:32,701
Marion: If you'd just
given us some warning...

61
00:07:32,869 --> 00:07:36,288
a phone call,
a telegram or something.

62
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:48,216
There. Ah.

63
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:50,844
We'll get this stuff
out of here first thing.

64
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,804
I don't know where
we're gonna put it all.

65
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,764
John: Well, half this junk
we can throw away.

66
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:57,267
That's not what you said
when we lugged it all up here.

67
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,019
Oh, that was
four years ago.

68
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:01,438
I'll clear a corner
and make do.

69
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:05,817
Absolutely not. We will have this place
spic and span as always.

70
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:09,070
This whole box can
go to the junk man.

71
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,369
(whispers)
Let's give him a moment.

72
00:08:42,563 --> 00:08:44,856
(train rattling)

73
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,325
Can we have three Cokes?

74
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:56,952
I could stand for some
whiskey instead of that.

75
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,120
- Coming up.
- (people chatting)

76
00:09:00,748 --> 00:09:02,457
Bartender:
There you go.

77
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,544
- Burgin: Thanks, Snaf.
- Snafu: My pleasure.

78
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,218
Hiya.
I'm Merriell Shelton.

79
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,554
How about I take you
to the back of the train

80
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:17,806
and you can show me
your caboose?

81
00:09:17,974 --> 00:09:19,975
- Man: Ouch.
- Did I tell you?

82
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,815
Feisty.

83
00:09:26,983 --> 00:09:29,359
Snafu just got pinked
on the train home.

84
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:31,486
If we'd had been here
six months ago,

85
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:32,988
that broad would've
given us all blowjobs.

86
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:36,116
- (guys laugh)
- Lied to again.

87
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:37,534
This entire division
didn't do

88
00:09:37,702 --> 00:09:39,494
that "plus six months"
horseshit we did.

89
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:42,497
They got home a week after V-J Day...
parades, pretty girls.

90
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,499
1946, the party's
all over.

91
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:48,169
Not so much
as a complimentary beer.

92
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,755
Somebody had
to stay and clean up after the war.

93
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,510
I suppose I'm gonna
have to get a job too.

94
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:57,679
- Doing what?
- I don't know.

95
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,099
Anything between digging ditches
and owning a bank.

96
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,602
- (chuckles)
- Nah.

97
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:05,812
First I've got to
get Florence home.

98
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,522
- Wait. Florence from Melbourne?
- Mm-hmm.

99
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:09,190
You're shipping her
all the way over here

100
00:10:09,358 --> 00:10:10,483
and this is the first
we hear about it?

101
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:12,027
Come on, Snaf.
That was in Okinawa.

102
00:10:12,194 --> 00:10:14,529
Figured it'd be bad luck
to talk about it then.

103
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,281
- Well, when is she coming?
- I don't know.

104
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:19,367
I cabled her,
but we've been at sea.

105
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,203
I guess I'm gonna
find out soon enough

106
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,122
whether I'm getting
married or not.

107
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,082
What about you,
Sledgehammer?

108
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:31,963
I'm just hoping this Florence girl
comes to her senses.

109
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,840
(guys laugh)

110
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,842
You got a job
lined up in Mobile?

111
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,220
No. No job, no girl,

112
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,555
no plans.

113
00:10:40,723 --> 00:10:42,474
How long do you
think that's gonna last?

114
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,019
- As long as the sheriff lets me.
- (Snafu chuckles)

115
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,857
I'm gonna get
that girl.

116
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:55,403
- Oh, leave her alone.
- You boys watch.

117
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,073
- I'm gonna get that girl.
- You've been saying that

118
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,076
- about every girl since San Diego.
- (guys laugh)

119
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,774
(knocker thuds)

120
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,776
(footsteps)

121
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,444
(door opens)

122
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,532
Mrs. Basilone,

123
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,368
I'm Lena.

124
00:11:46,288 --> 00:11:49,958
I recognize you
from the photos Johnny sent.

125
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:58,758
Well, come in.

126
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:03,888
(door closes)

127
00:12:08,144 --> 00:12:10,645
(speaking Italian)

128
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,111
Lena...

129
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:21,114
he says
you're beautiful.

130
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,032
George.

131
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,994
I heard
so much about you.

132
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,747
The last time
I saw him in Honolulu,

133
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:32,625
he couldn't stop
talking about you.

134
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:36,463
He was just about
to ship out.

135
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,011
Would you like
a coffee?

136
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,555
No. Thank you.
I'm fine.

137
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:47,515
(Salvatore speaking)

138
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,771
Please sit down.

139
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,939
Thank you.

140
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,291
You have
a very nice home.

141
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,877
Thank you.

142
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,424
The 4th Marines
are mustered out.

143
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,426
How about you?

144
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,970
I'm waiting
for orders.

145
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:28,014
Hurry up and wait.

146
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,978
Do you...
do you need anything?

147
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:36,648
No. No, I'm not
here for...

148
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,733
John's insurance money

149
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,236
is gonna help you out,
right, Lena?

150
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,573
Actually, he never
signed the papers.

151
00:13:45,741 --> 00:13:49,828
George: He never signed?
That's $10,000.

152
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:52,831
It's okay.
I'm all right.

153
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,758
George:
I saw his grave on lwo.

154
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:07,345
He's got lots of good marines
on all sides of him.

155
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,975
He...

156
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:14,435
he would've
appreciated that.

157
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,816
Are you sure
about that coffee?

158
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,235
Maybe something stiffer?

159
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,529
No.

160
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,448
(sniffles)
I came by because

161
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:31,953
I thought
you should have this.

162
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,160
(crying)

163
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,333
- There's my little brother.
- Porter: Jewett!

164
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:02,377
Jewett, Texas!

165
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:04,629
No sign of Florence.

166
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:10,051
Melbourne's a hell
of a long way, Burgie.

167
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:15,223
It'll take Florence a while to get
from Australia to here.

168
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,191
Thanks...

169
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:32,407
for doing all you did to keep us from
getting our fool heads shot off.

170
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:36,911
You're good marines.

171
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:34,594
(phones ringing)

172
00:17:37,973 --> 00:17:39,932
- It's him.
- It is?

173
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,435
- It's Robert.
- (chatting)

174
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,563
You made quite
an entrance, Bob.

175
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,775
(chuckles)
The whole room is buzzing.

176
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,696
I hope they meet
their deadlines.

177
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,408
We're all
mighty proud of you,

178
00:17:57,576 --> 00:17:59,160
proud of all
you soldiers.

179
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,996
I was a marine.

180
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,334
We're proud
of all of you.

181
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,962
So now you're back.

182
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,006
I'm guessing
you're here for a job.

183
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:14,092
That's why
they made you the editor.

184
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,802
I'll take
my former position.

185
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,804
Well, you still want
to cover local sports?

186
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:20,098
Yup... to start with.

187
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,142
Here's why:

188
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,479
That guy you've got writing
the column right now...

189
00:18:26,647 --> 00:18:28,481
he's got no snap,
no style.

190
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,484
The prose just lays there like
spilled ink on newsprint.

191
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:33,820
You need to send him to obits
and give me his desk.

192
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,824
- I do?
- For the sake of the paper.

193
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:41,369
And when did you
see me demoting him and hiring you?

194
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:43,871
- Today is good.
- Today?

195
00:18:44,039 --> 00:18:46,290
Bergen Catholic plays
Don Bosco Prep this afternoon.

196
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,751
The kickoff is
at 3:00, so...

197
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:53,214
- I'd better get going.
- (clears throat)

198
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,300
Shouldn't we talk
about salary?

199
00:18:56,468 --> 00:18:58,719
$10 a week raise
will do it.

200
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:02,098
- I will give you $7.
- I'd have taken $5.

201
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:06,894
(typewriter clicking)

202
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,573
- (sighs)
- (car approaches)

203
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:22,201
(brakes squeak)

204
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,704
(Vera laughs)

205
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:08,539
What are
you looking at?

206
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,125
Are you a Jap?

207
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,045
Honestly, 'cause you
sneak up like one.

208
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:15,463
(sniffles)

209
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,348
You are spying
on Vera Keller.

210
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,433
- My God.
- Ma.

211
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,186
She never gave you
the time of day.

212
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:33,481
And she's dating
an officer, of course.

213
00:20:33,649 --> 00:20:36,234
- (door closes)
- Look at that fancy car.

214
00:20:36,401 --> 00:20:37,860
Did you come up here
for a reason?

215
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:40,571
To get you to stop banging
on that typewriter.

216
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,114
It's called working, Ma.

217
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,158
Not sitting there
like that, it isn't.

218
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,751
(chuckles)
Look at this mess.

219
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,762
Mmm, your dress blues.

220
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,475
You've never
even worn them.

221
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:25,032
I think you would've
looked nice in them.

222
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,047
(train rattling)

223
00:21:45,762 --> 00:21:48,306
Porter:
New Orleans Crescent City,

224
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,891
home to the Delta Blues
and the French Quarter.

225
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:53,644
Watch your wallets,
pockets and watches.

226
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,855
This is New Orleans.

227
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,797
Man:
Hot links!

228
00:22:21,965 --> 00:22:24,300
Get your
hot links here!

229
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,218
Hey, how about
a hot link?

230
00:22:26,386 --> 00:22:28,387
(people chatting)

231
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:50,076
(knocks)

232
00:22:51,912 --> 00:22:53,913
(footsteps approach)

233
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:59,502
- Yes?
- Mrs. Keller.

234
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,462
Yes.

235
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,631
I'd like to speak
to Vera, please.

236
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:05,633
And who shall
I say is calling?

237
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:07,635
Robert Leckie,
Mrs. Keller.

238
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:11,097
I've lived across the street from you
for the last 20 years.

239
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:14,642
Of course.

240
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:16,560
Welcome home, Robert.

241
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:19,438
Let me just see
if she can come to the door.

242
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,582
Bob Leckie.

243
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,293
You're back.

244
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:44,004
I was afraid you wouldn't
remember me either.

245
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:46,841
Oh, I remember you.
The last time I saw you was

246
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:49,135
in church right before
you shipped out.

247
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:51,095
So...

248
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,305
you look well.

249
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,183
Nice uniform.

250
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:58,602
(chuckles)
Thank you.

251
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,525
I've been wondering
if you would grant me

252
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,610
the pleasure
of taking you out.

253
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,446
You want
to take me out?

254
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,198
- Yes, I do.
- (chuckles)

255
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,201
Uh, I have
a date tonight.

256
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:16,996
When the doorbell rang,
I thought you were him.

257
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:22,960
- Well, there he is.
- (engine stops)

258
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:25,129
(car door opens)

259
00:24:28,383 --> 00:24:30,217
Nice car.

260
00:24:38,768 --> 00:24:41,770
Hey. Robert Leckie.

261
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,397
Charles Dunworthy.

262
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:45,566
- Vera.
- Mmm. Army, huh, Charlie?

263
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,193
Where'd you serve?

264
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,320
I just graduated
from West Point.

265
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,906
Lieutenant.
Congratulations.

266
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:55,409
Too bad you missed
the whole show.

267
00:24:57,204 --> 00:24:58,913
Vera...

268
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:02,666
how about
another time?

269
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,668
Maybe tomorrow night?

270
00:25:04,836 --> 00:25:06,587
What's going on here?

271
00:25:06,755 --> 00:25:08,506
I just asked Vera if she'd like
to have dinner.

272
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,591
Huh. Nice try.

273
00:25:10,759 --> 00:25:12,384
She's not interested.

274
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:19,099
Actually, I don't have any plans
for tomorrow night.

275
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:23,812
Oh, is that right?
Really?

276
00:25:27,901 --> 00:25:30,361
Obviously I've been wasting
a lot of gasoline.

277
00:25:32,906 --> 00:25:35,115
Good night, Vera.

278
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,415
Well, it looks like I am free
for dinner tonight.

279
00:25:43,583 --> 00:25:45,125
(car door opens, closes)

280
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,294
(people chatting)

281
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:54,134
So what are you gonna do
now that you're home?

282
00:25:54,302 --> 00:25:57,721
Oh, I'm back writing for
"The Bergen County Record."

283
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,307
Oh, we don't get
"The Record."

284
00:26:02,143 --> 00:26:04,061
I'll talk
to subscriptions.

285
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:14,321
(giggles)
You're staring.

286
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,323
Oh. I'm sorry.

287
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,620
No.

288
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,665
Actually, I'm not.

289
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:29,128
Three years ago
in a miserable part of the Pacific,

290
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:31,338
I was laying
in the mud,

291
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:33,674
dreaming about a moment
like this with you.

292
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:39,680
You get right to it,
don't you?

293
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:44,101
In the mud?

294
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,521
Afraid so.

295
00:26:48,648 --> 00:26:50,983
You must've been
through a lot.

296
00:26:58,074 --> 00:26:59,575
Well, here we are.

297
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:02,077
- Mm-hmm.
- So what's next?

298
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,246
I don't know.
I didn't get that far.

299
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,541
And why me?

300
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:11,629
Why not Rita Hayworth
or Betty Grable?

301
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:14,923
Because I know you.

302
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,967
Bob, you don't...

303
00:27:19,012 --> 00:27:21,305
you don't
really know me.

304
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,891
You're right.

305
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,143
Yeah.

306
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:27,770
I think...
I don't...

307
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,730
I don't know
how to do this.

308
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:32,358
Bob, you're doing fine.
This is fine.

309
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,487
It's a start.

310
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:48,499
You know, I wrote you
a lot of letters while I was over there.

311
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:51,919
You did?
I didn't get any.

312
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,338
- I never sent 'em.
- Why?

313
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,340
(laughs)

314
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,217
I thought...

315
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,429
I didn't think
I was gonna make it,

316
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:04,765
so it didn't matter
if I sent 'em or not.

317
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:10,270
Can I read them now?

318
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,814
I don't
have 'em anymore.

319
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:14,608
Rain on Cape Gloucester
erased every word.

320
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,697
What were they like,
these letters?

321
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:24,118
Best stuff
I ever wrote.

322
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,750
- (bell clanging)
- (train rattling)

323
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,754
(whistle tweets)

324
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:45,806
(people chatting)

325
00:28:53,148 --> 00:28:55,149
Hey, buddy.
I appreciate you coming.

326
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,775
Man: Thanks so much
for picking me up.

327
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:05,659
- Hi, fella. How are you?
- Good to see you.

328
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,999
You gonna take this
for me or what?

329
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,961
Good to see you, Eugene.

330
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,756
We'll just
drive up to Chickasaw.

331
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:20,841
So good
to see you.

332
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:28,390
What's with
the MacArthur bit?

333
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,850
- Huh?
- The Mammy Yokum.

334
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:32,227
Popeye the sailor.

335
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,356
It calms me down.

336
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:38,484
Packing it,
cleaning it...

337
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,611
I always have
something to do.

338
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:45,199
What do you remember
about Mary Houston?

339
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:48,786
- Mary Houston?
- Yeah.

340
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:50,829
The Mary Houston?

341
00:29:50,997 --> 00:29:53,040
Well, like everybody
else in Mobile,

342
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:55,834
- I was in love with Mary Houston.
- That's too bad for you.

343
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,337
- She's marrying me.
- Yeah, sure she will...

344
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,964
- the minute she goes blind.
- Well, I asked her.

345
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,551
She said yes, so you're just gonna have
to deal with it, brother.

346
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:08,806
You're saying
that Mary Houston

347
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,058
is gonna be
Mary Houston Phillips?

348
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,393
In the eyes of God
and the law.

349
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,020
(chuckles)

350
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,022
Well, what am
I gonna hear next?

351
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,566
That Martians landed downtown?
They're setting up a hotel?

352
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:22,194
I want you
to be my best man.

353
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:27,199
If you think that I'm gonna
stand at the altar

354
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:29,243
and lose Mary Houston
to the likes of you...

355
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,661
(chuckles)

356
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,750
- Well, hell yes!
- Come on, Eugene!

357
00:30:36,918 --> 00:30:38,710
- (honking)
- Sid: Hey, come on!

358
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,879
(both laughing)

359
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,560
Right here is
fine, Sid.

360
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,438
Are you sure
this is good?

361
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,943
Yup.

362
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,461
See you later.

363
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,298
Welcome home, Eugene.

364
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,872
(dishes clinking)

365
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,370
(footsteps)

366
00:33:21,624 --> 00:33:23,500
(laughs)

367
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,109
Oh!
(crying)

368
00:33:52,947 --> 00:33:54,781
(chatting)

369
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:57,075
Hand me your plate
right there, will you?

370
00:33:57,243 --> 00:34:00,412
- Mary: Yes, give him a big slice.
- A nice big slice.

371
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,123
Edward:
How many would you like?

372
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:04,791
Thank you.

373
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,585
Honey, would you
like some corn?

374
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:09,254
- Yes, thank you.
- I'll get you some corn.

375
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,886
I can help you set.
Eat up, sweetheart.

376
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,971
Now are you sure
you don't want anymore?

377
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:21,141
- Dr. Sledge: We should have a little toast.
- Oh, that's lovely, yes.

378
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:22,726
To Edward's new wife
and the boys being home.

379
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:26,271
Here's a little souvenir that I brought
back from Prague.

380
00:34:26,439 --> 00:34:29,941
- My lord.
- Edward, it's extraordinary.

381
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,569
Edward: It was floating along
the ground in this forest

382
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:34,696
that me and my buddy
Jack were sitting in.

383
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,782
I ran over
and I picked it up...

384
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:38,950
(conversation fades)

385
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,582
(mumbling)

386
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:57,677
Stop! No!

387
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:25,497
(birds chirping)

388
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,574
Edward: I didn't get any sleep
for the longest time.

389
00:36:01,742 --> 00:36:03,743
I still can't,
really.

390
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:07,372
I toss and turn
like crazy.

391
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,876
Martha doesn't complain,

392
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:13,670
but I know I keep
waking her up.

393
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,345
Give me your coffee.

394
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,695
I like Martha.

395
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:42,574
You're a lucky man.

396
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,576
You'll be married...

397
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,453
someday.

398
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:54,377
And just how did my little brother
do during his time in the service?

399
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:58,715
There weren't any women
in my corner of the Pacific.

400
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,469
Only nurses
and they were off-limits.

401
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:05,430
Jesus H. You went
through the entire war

402
00:37:05,598 --> 00:37:07,265
and retained
your virginity?

403
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:10,894
Well, your lonely nights
are numbered, Gene.

404
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:14,272
Every single girl in Mobile is out
to land a fighting man.

405
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,107
At the OOM Ball,

406
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:18,735
you'll have a leg up
on all those desk pilots.

407
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:20,528
Who says I want
a leg up on anybody?

408
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,698
You show up at that ball decked out
in your uniform

409
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:27,994
and all the ripe fruit will fall off the tree
right at your feet.

410
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:29,829
You know, Edward,
I don't believe I will.

411
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:33,375
You're gonna pass
on the OOM Ball?

412
00:37:33,542 --> 00:37:37,837
No. I don't believe
I will ever put on a uniform again.

413
00:37:42,635 --> 00:37:44,302
Ever.

414
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:50,976
Not a lick
of sense in you.

415
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:08,159
- (chatting)
- Registration?

416
00:38:10,913 --> 00:38:12,539
Man: That's right,
'cause if you don't do it,

417
00:38:12,707 --> 00:38:14,791
they're gonna make
you get back in line again.

418
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:16,793
Service number right here.

419
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:26,219
If you could just
head up back there,

420
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,722
that'd be great.
Thank you.

421
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:33,476
You're looking to register
for classes, Mr. Sledge?

422
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:35,687
- I'm thinking about it.
- Good choice.

423
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:38,231
Alabama Polytechnic
is the best.

424
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:40,400
Which branch did
you serve in?

425
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:42,527
I was
in the Marine Corps, miss.

426
00:38:43,571 --> 00:38:46,072
"U.S.M.C."

427
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,492
And did you attend any special schools
while in the Marine Corps?

428
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:52,579
Just boot camp.

429
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,539
Weapons school.

430
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,083
I was
in a mortar squad.

431
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:00,211
Okay. Did you
do any accounting?

432
00:39:00,379 --> 00:39:01,838
No, miss.

433
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,382
Any journalism?

434
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,217
None at all.

435
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:08,261
Any engineering,
technical skills?

436
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:10,555
I had to handle
explosives.

437
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,766
Okay.

438
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:17,270
Isn't there anything
the Marine Corps taught you

439
00:39:17,438 --> 00:39:19,606
that you can continue
at 'Bama Poly?

440
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:26,988
They taught me
how to kill Japs.

441
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:31,117
I got pretty
damn good at it.

442
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,965
- (swing music playing)
- (people laughing, chatting)

443
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:49,469
- Oh, I just love this song.
- I know.

444
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,778
Uh, excuse me.

445
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:47,277
Sid:
I saw you making a break for it.

446
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:51,364
I thought you could use
a punch properly spiked.

447
00:40:51,532 --> 00:40:53,366
Thank you.

448
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,536
Drink fast.
If Mary catches us,

449
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:59,038
she'll have me back inside
dancing all night.

450
00:40:59,206 --> 00:41:00,832
(chuckles)
You see that?

451
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,417
That's why
I'm still a bachelor.

452
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:06,379
I don't dance until Eugene Sledge
wants to dance.

453
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,431
How did all this happen?

454
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,893
I mean look at us, Sid,

455
00:41:22,062 --> 00:41:24,147
sitting here at a dance,
drinking punch.

456
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,649
Not a scratch
on either of us.

457
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,945
I mean what the hell
are we doing here?

458
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,242
And why... why did
I end up back here

459
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:38,411
when all those
other fellas didn't?

460
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,957
I thought that.

461
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:46,628
Every guy back
has thought that.

462
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:53,468
But you've just got to pull yourself out
of bed in the morning

463
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:55,261
and get on with the day.

464
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,973
You do that
enough times in a row,

465
00:41:59,141 --> 00:42:02,101
you forget some things.

466
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,981
For a while, anyway.

467
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:13,112
- Sidney Phillips.
- Yeah.

468
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,699
Will you get back in here and dance
with the woman who loves you?

469
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:18,535
I'm coming, boss lady.

470
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:21,704
Why don't you come on in?
I'll wrangle you a partner.

471
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:27,126
No.

472
00:42:48,816 --> 00:42:51,276
- (crickets chirping)
- (dog barks)

473
00:42:52,361 --> 00:42:53,987
Look at these televisions.

474
00:42:54,154 --> 00:42:57,448
There isn't
but two hours of programs

475
00:42:57,616 --> 00:43:00,118
and they're asking
$300 a set.

476
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:01,661
Sounds like
the future to me.

477
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:03,079
I'm gonna run down
to Murphy's and buy one

478
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,581
as soon as I have
the money for a down payment.

479
00:43:04,748 --> 00:43:05,957
On a reporter's salary?

480
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:07,500
John: And how about
this railroad strike?

481
00:43:07,668 --> 00:43:09,669
It's crippled traffic
across the country.

482
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:12,505
Marion:
Room on the table, please.

483
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:15,592
- Well, how do they work?
- Is that creamed spinach?

484
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:17,135
The waves are
collected by a receiver,

485
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:19,220
shot through an electron gun
onto a vacuum screen.

486
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:21,431
Always with the answers.

487
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,017
It's called
a cathode ray tube.

488
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,185
- Man: Those things heat up, you know...
- Thank you.

489
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,688
...catch on fire.
- John: So you think you're going down

490
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,857
to Murphy's to get
yourself a television set?

491
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:33,192
Well, there aren't any.
Nothing's being delivered.

492
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:35,361
Why creamed spinach?

493
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,405
Man #2: I think the army should
take over the railroads.

494
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:39,449
That'll teach 'em.
Right, Bob?

495
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:42,243
You know they transmit from the top
of the Empire State Building?

496
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:45,330
I bet in five years
everyone's gonna want one.

497
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:47,790
Steel workers and electrical workers
are also on strike.

498
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,543
Who's next?
We just won the war

499
00:43:50,711 --> 00:43:52,503
and now they're
holding us hostage.

500
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:55,173
We didn't fight for a bunch
of greedy strikers.

501
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:59,010
What did we fight for? I thought it was
to beat the Japs and the Nazis.

502
00:43:59,178 --> 00:44:01,804
I'm just saying the country
won't survive these strikes.

503
00:44:01,972 --> 00:44:03,181
Too bad we didn't lose the war.

504
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:04,557
Then the Japs would
have all these problems.

505
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:07,894
- Very funny.
- Man: Bob, we all appreciate

506
00:44:08,062 --> 00:44:10,605
the sacrifice you made
on our account.

507
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:12,523
You know what
I fought for?

508
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,238
Television.

509
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,370
Foddy, ask the blessings,
please.

510
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:29,374
(clears throat)
Our Father

511
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:33,086
Who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

512
00:44:33,253 --> 00:44:36,339
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done

513
00:44:36,507 --> 00:44:38,383
on earth
as it is in heaven.

514
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:41,678
Give us this day
our daily bread

515
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,930
and forgive us
our trespasses

516
00:44:44,098 --> 00:44:45,682
as we forgive those
that trespass against us.

517
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,602
Lead us not
into temptation

518
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:52,438
but deliver us
from evil.

519
00:44:52,606 --> 00:44:54,399
- Amen.
- Amen.

520
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:57,110
- Leckie: Amen.
- Amen.

521
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:00,196
Amen.

522
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,143
(birds chirping)

523
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:48,161
I thought we'd start at what's left of that
old fence down by the creek.

524
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:10,725
I've been looking forward
to this morning for a long time.

525
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:14,061
Just the two of us
and a grand morning.

526
00:46:14,229 --> 00:46:16,230
(breathing hard)

527
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,784
(crying)

528
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,038
Eugene?

529
00:46:40,714 --> 00:46:42,548
I'm sorry.

530
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:47,261
I can't.

531
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:49,597
It's all right.

532
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:58,231
You don't have to
apologize to me, Eugene.

533
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:09,826
I reckon the dove population is gonna be
mighty happy this morning.

534
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,932
Honestly, Eugene,

535
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,601
you look like a gangster
with those glasses on.

536
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:43,985
Your brother's coming
for supper this evening.

537
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:47,613
Evidently, he's been named
some kind of supervisor at the bank.

538
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,159
Better get our money
out of that bank.

539
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,415
I'm sure Edward
could arrange

540
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:59,250
a starting
position for you

541
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:01,627
at the bank.

542
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:04,130
I'm never going to work
in a bank, Mother.

543
00:48:06,967 --> 00:48:09,594
Well, you need to make

544
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,637
a plan for the future.

545
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:15,224
My plan is to do
nothing for a while.

546
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,269
How long is
"a while," Eugene?

547
00:48:18,437 --> 00:48:21,147
Leave him alone,
Mary Frank.

548
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:25,902
The boy is idle, Edward.

549
00:48:26,069 --> 00:48:29,071
- He is not a boy.
- Well, he's acting like one.

550
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:32,950
Mary Frank,
you have no idea

551
00:48:33,118 --> 00:48:35,453
what men like him
have been through.

552
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:40,458
Now go on.
Let him be.

553
00:48:47,674 --> 00:48:49,175
(sighs)

554
00:49:46,358 --> 00:57:00,541
(theme music playing)
