1
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:27,156
<i>"Thou shalt not kill"</i>

2
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,199
THE MESSENGER

3
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,672
<i>Henry V of England and Charles VI</i>
<i>of France sign the treaty of Troyes.</i>

4
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,032
<i>It says that the Kingdom of France shall</i>
<i>belong to England upon the King's death.</i>

5
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,073
<i>But both kings die</i>
<i>within months of each other.</i>

6
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,511
<i>Henry VI, but a baby, is the new king</i>
<i>of England and France.</i>

7
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:56,871
<i>Charles VII, Dauphin of France,</i>
<i>will not abandon his kingdom to a child,</i>

8
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:59,036
<i>nor to his tutor, the Duke of Bedford.</i>

9
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,679
<i>Bloody war breaks out,</i>

10
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,394
<i>the English and their Burgundy allies</i>
<i>invade France.</i>

11
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,676
Is anybody there?

12
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:10,670
Jeanne...

13
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,074
I'm always happy to see you

14
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,960
but to keep coming 3 times a day...

15
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,115
I need to confess.

16
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,992
You already did this morning.

17
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,753
I need to confess again.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,434
What is this terrible sin
that can't wait till tomorrow?

19
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,474
I saw a poor monk without shoes...
so I gave him some.

20
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,750
There is no sin in charity.

21
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,999
They weren't mine.

22
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:37,916
Whose were they?

23
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,635
My father's.

24
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:41,155
He'll forgive you.

25
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,194
He already did,
but I want Jesus to forgive me too.

26
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,753
If we were to ask forgiveness
all the time

27
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,518
we'd spend our life in church.

28
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,790
Is that bad?

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:53,877
Well no, but...

30
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,394
Are you happy at home?

31
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,313
Yes... very.

32
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,591
Everything's fine with your mother?

33
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,031
Yes, she's... wonderful.

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,038
You sister Catherine
is still your best friend?

35
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:10,915
My sister's just...
She's wonderful!

36
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,680
And your other friends?
You don't like

37
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,279
playing with them?

38
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:17,598
I play with them.
Lots!

39
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,392
So everything sounds "wonderful".

40
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:23,518
Yes, it is.

41
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,793
Why do you come so often?

42
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:30,591
I feel safe here,
where I can talk to him.

43
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,029
"Him"?

44
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:39,232
I try to talk to him,
but he does most of the talking.

45
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,998
Who is this...

46
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,995
"he"?

47
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,599
He never says his name.

48
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,669
What...

49
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,358
does he... look like?

50
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,039
Beautiful.

51
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,239
What does he say to you?

52
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,634
He says...

53
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,716
He says I must be good,

54
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,678
and help everyone,

55
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,950
and take care of myself.

56
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,038
Is he coming from the sky?

57
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,548
Perhaps.

58
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,232
Wherever he's coming from,
I think you should

59
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,031
listen to him. It sounds like
he's giving you very good advice.

60
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,671
It's... wonderful!

61
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,231
<i>Jeanne...</i>

62
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,759
Mother!

63
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,830
Catherine!

64
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:42,076
Jeanne!
Did they hurt you?

65
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,828
No, I'm fine.

66
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,275
Where were you?
The English are everywhere!

67
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,238
I was with the priest.

68
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,590
You know what he said to me?

69
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,956
Tell me later. Hide in here!

70
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,037
Where'll you be?

71
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,119
Right here... I promise.

72
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,438
Well, that's what I call booty!

73
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,552
A woman with a sword!

74
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,428
Look at this!

75
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,914
Frenchmen are such cowards
they have women fight!

76
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,797
If that's God's will,
then so be it.

77
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:19,513
Fine with me. I love women.

78
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,559
Hold still, bitch!

79
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,751
Stop wriggling about!

80
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:36,675
Your turn now.

81
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:11,073
God bless the soul of this departed.

82
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,433
Keep us safe
from fear and sin.

83
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,596
Listen, Jeanne.

84
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:06,153
You will stay with your aunt
and uncle for a while.

85
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,715
Just to give us time
to rebuild things.

86
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,359
You understand?

87
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:29,599
Lord, teach us always
to love this land and to save it

88
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,430
from those who seek to destroy it.

89
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,235
Goodnight.

90
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,394
What'll happen to her?

91
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,757
She'll be fine.

92
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:11,833
She'll grow up, find a man,
have children.

93
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,439
Don't worry.

94
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,153
She'll survive.

95
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,114
Tomorrow,
she'll be as right as rain.

96
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,634
You'll see.

97
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:26,072
I want to see a priest.

98
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,353
Why did she have to die?

99
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,996
Only God can answer that.

100
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,556
Jesus says to love your enemies

101
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:55,476
but I can't.

102
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:57,990
I want the English to burn in hell

103
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,519
for ever and ever!

104
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:04,069
I realise your anger,
but we must learn

105
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:05,429
to forgive.

106
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,031
Revenge will never
bring about peace.

107
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,595
Then what will?
What will bring her back?

108
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,598
Why did she have to die

109
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,518
instead of me?

110
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,990
Why didn't he take my life?

111
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:23,036
It's my fault. I was late,
she gave me her hiding place.

112
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,952
Why did He save me?

113
00:17:25,240 --> 00:17:28,312
Calm down, Jeanne.

114
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:33,832
I don't pretend to know God's will,

115
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,310
but one thing I am sure of:

116
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,279
The Lord always

117
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,311
has a good reason.

118
00:17:41,040 --> 00:17:44,157
Perhaps he chose you
because he needs you

119
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,836
for some higher calling.

120
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,713
So, as long as you answer that call,

121
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,037
your sister will not have died in vain.

122
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,797
I don't want to wait for His call.

123
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,713
Be patient.

124
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,196
I want to be with Him always!

125
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,551
Soon you'll be able
to take part in the Holy Mass.

126
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,792
When you eat of His flesh
and drink of His blood,

127
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,831
you will be at one with Him.

128
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:12,073
I want to be at one with Him now!

129
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,433
So what did he say?

130
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,280
We must bring her to church
whenever she wants.

131
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:26,711
Easy for him...
He's not doing the bringing!

132
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,879
This is important.
We mustn't let her out of our sight.

133
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,314
Don't worry.

134
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,909
I'll watch her
like my own shadow.

135
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:25,633
I want to be at one with You now!

136
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,076
A message for the Dauphin of France.

137
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,395
Captain,
a message for the Dauphin.

138
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:21,948
I'll take it.

139
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:29,911
The Dauphin!

140
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,275
Louis!

141
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,998
Shouldn't you be studying?

142
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,031
No, I want to fight!

143
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,868
You will.
But first, learn to wipe your nose.

144
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,354
A letter for His Majesty.

145
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:09,148
Another one from this
"Maiden of Lorraine"!

146
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,396
I can read, you know.

147
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,477
She pretends to be sent by God.

148
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,911
Charlatans! And not enough
wood to burn them all...

149
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,599
She'll be here tomorrow.

150
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:23,271
Don't see her, my Lord.
Who knows if she's really from Lorraine?

151
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,357
What difference would it make?

152
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:28,472
If she comes from Burgundy,
it might be a trap.

153
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,638
"Signed X".
What sort of a name is "X"?

154
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,718
A messenger of God
can't even write her own name?

155
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,912
Trémoïlle is right.
She says she hears voices.

156
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,435
She may be a witch!

157
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:43,393
Regnault!
You see witches everywhere.

158
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,592
She's just a peasant.

159
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:49,031
A peasant who... cares about her king.

160
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:53,074
All she wants is to see me crowned
and to fight for me.

161
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,955
No. She wants you to give her
an army at your expense.

162
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,072
Since your mother stole
most of the Treasury,

163
00:22:00,280 --> 00:22:02,236
I fail to see
how you can afford this.

164
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,192
I can see her if I want to.

165
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:11,390
As the English hold half of France,
what have I to lose?

166
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,149
The other half.

167
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,478
You mustn't see her.

168
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,551
She may be an instrument of the Devil.

169
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,392
I think you should.

170
00:22:26,160 --> 00:22:28,469
How amusing! I'd love to know

171
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,553
why my devoted
mother-in-law thinks one thing

172
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:36,629
and my two most loyal advisors
think precisely the opposite.

173
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,076
Because I care about you.

174
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:40,597
Come here.

175
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,913
Your health and happiness
have been my priority

176
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,992
ever since you were a little boy.

177
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,878
I know you better than your mother.

178
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,035
You think so?

179
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,832
I know the sickness
that plagues your heart,

180
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:10,238
how painful it is to have loved
a father, without knowing

181
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,839
if he was really yours.

182
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,918
Do I know you enough?

183
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,751
What's that got to do
with this Maiden?

184
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:24,789
Who better than a messenger from God
to give you answers?

185
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,793
You think she was sent from God?

186
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,831
You're a fine judge of character.

187
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,548
You'll soon expose her
if she's a fake.

188
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,189
But... if she's not,

189
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,636
she'll give you your answers

190
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:44,954
and your crown.

191
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:52,076
I think it's going
to take more than a peasant...

192
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:54,316
I don't care what you think

193
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:57,796
or even what I think
but what simple people think!

194
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:02,915
Up and down the country
they are already talking about her.

195
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:06,236
Simple people are always ready

196
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:09,238
to believe any old prophecy.

197
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,473
Like this one.

198
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,913
About a virgin from Lorraine

199
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,918
saving France.

200
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,034
And now,

201
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,436
this girl comes along...

202
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,952
from Lorraine.

203
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:36,596
And there's a spark of hope
in their simple minds.

204
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:46,597
We shouldn't disappoint them.

205
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,236
If they believe in her

206
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,913
to put back the fire in our army,

207
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,916
then I believe in her too.

208
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,598
Stop, Louis!

209
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,711
Be quiet for once!

210
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,150
- She's coming, your Majesty.
- Alright.

211
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,799
Calm yourself.

212
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:43,514
I urge you not to see her.
It reeks of a Burgundian trap.

213
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,396
For my astrologers, the timing is good:
Leo, with Virgo rising.

214
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:53,628
On the astrological chart,
the virgin is next to the lion.

215
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,831
Supposing she's an assassin?

216
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:01,110
My dear Trémoïlle,
I'm not even king yet.

217
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,356
Who would want to kill me?

218
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:55,635
She's in the guards' room!

219
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:56,915
Fine.

220
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,752
I suppose
I'll have to make a decision.

221
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,070
Why is life so complicated?

222
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:19,712
Sometimes I wish
I were someone else.

223
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,432
Good idea, Sire.

224
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,639
What do you mean?

225
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,713
Let someone else pretend
to be you, and see if...

226
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,354
If she can find me?
Brilliant idea!

227
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,279
If she's sent by God,
she will guess.

228
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:40,472
If not, she will kill the wrong man.
Brilliant!

229
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,314
Please!

230
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,991
We're going to play a little game.

231
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:58,672
Now, let us pretend
that my throne is empty.

232
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,393
Just pretend!

233
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,793
Who wants to be king?

234
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,276
There's a heart-warming sight!

235
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:13,839
Now let us see...

236
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,594
Which one of you
could possibly pass

237
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,270
as the King of France?

238
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,468
Alençon...

239
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,755
My noble duke, my royal cousin,
so fine, so rich...

240
00:28:26,280 --> 00:28:29,113
Far too rich
to be the King of France.

241
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:32,915
Everyone knows
I'm the poorest in my kingdom.

242
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,873
Gilles de Rais, Marshal of France...

243
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:43,751
Formidable to men,
fascinating to women,

244
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:45,554
feared by all.

245
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:49,309
You'd be perfect to sit on my throne.

246
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:50,835
So perfect,

247
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,436
that you might like it too much
and disturb

248
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,677
my fragile peace of mind.

249
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,040
La Hire, my angry captain...

250
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,072
The bravest in France.

251
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:09,916
Scarred by 12 wars,
but with a heart for 12 more.

252
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,394
You could pass for the king.

253
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,794
Damn bloody right!

254
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,152
But no one with a tongue like that
could pass for King of France.

255
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:30,519
Seems it'll have to be me after all.

256
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,278
Why not you?

257
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,913
Jean d'Aulon!

258
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,478
The only man
who's poorer than I,

259
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,990
so the only man I can trust.

260
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:46,671
Dignified, honourable, wise...

261
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,190
What more can we ask of a king?

262
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,118
I'm not sure that...

263
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,594
You're not ready to die
for me?

264
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,755
Of course I am.

265
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,913
Until then, live like a king!
Bring her up!

266
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,718
Sire,
I am bad at this sort of game.

267
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,638
Pretend it's not a game.

268
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,678
- Mother...
- Not now!

269
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,071
I've come to see the Dauphin.

270
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,516
Who are you?

271
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,069
I'm...

272
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,517
His most gracious Majesty
Charles de Valois,

273
00:32:23,720 --> 00:32:24,994
Dauphin of France.

274
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,996
I can see you are a good man,

275
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,199
but you're not the Dauphin.

276
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:54,555
Sorry to insist,

277
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:59,470
but I must see him.
We've no time to lose, where is he?

278
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,599
He's here.

279
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,030
Find him yourself.

280
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,715
Now you'll see
who'll pass for a king.

281
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,394
There's no need to be afraid, Sire.

282
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:50,190
I'm not the King.

283
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:52,916
I know you're not yet,

284
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,918
but you will be soon.

285
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:06,597
Out!

286
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,033
How did you know?

287
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,037
- Her "voices"!
- They said:

288
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,708
"The one in the corner
with a big nose."

289
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,712
Oh, my gentle Dauphin!

290
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,589
I have a message

291
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,555
from the King of Heaven.

292
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,519
For you!

293
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,956
You only.

294
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:01,349
Follow me.

295
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,473
Trémoïlle,
I know I can count on you...

296
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,039
As always, Majesty.

297
00:36:09,560 --> 00:36:13,075
...to ensure our privacy,
I need to talk to her alone.

298
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,269
He needs to talk to her alone.

299
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,155
Fine.

300
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:41,993
I was about ten.

301
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:47,079
On a sunny spring day,
I was walking home

302
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,432
when a strange wind

303
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,279
began to blow.

304
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,074
It was such a strange sound,
almost like words,

305
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,959
calling me.

306
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,512
The second time

307
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,678
was many years later.

308
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:34,716
I was coming back from church,
when suddenly,

309
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:36,359
the same...

310
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:40,038
violent wind...

311
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,635
Then,

312
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:50,394
a shape

313
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:52,553
appeared

314
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,031
in the middle of the sky.

315
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,554
The shape...

316
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,715
of a man.

317
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,717
Everything was moving so fast.

318
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,674
The wind, the clouds...

319
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,073
I couldn't move, I couldn't breathe.

320
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:34,039
I was so... afraid.

321
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:36,759
He was...

322
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:39,076
so...

323
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:43,634
here!

324
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:55,471
Then I knew God had chosen me,

325
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,631
but I didn't understand

326
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:59,990
what my mission was.

327
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,595
What could I do?

328
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:05,759
Help my country but how?
I was just a poor girl!

329
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:08,030
I didn't know anything

330
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,755
about making war or riding.

331
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,758
So I decided to wait

332
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,234
and not to speak of it

333
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:18,510
- to anybody.
- You did well.

334
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,189
I didn't wait long.

335
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,591
I was going to Mass,

336
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,277
like I do every day,

337
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,913
when the same...

338
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:34,119
strange wind...

339
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,276
Everything was made clear.

340
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,556
God had given me a message.

341
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,836
A message to deliver.

342
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:19,193
What was the message?

343
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,673
He said,

344
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,318
I must save France
from her enemies

345
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,428
and bring her back
to the hands of God.

346
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:39,714
And He told me that I...

347
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:41,479
Jeanne,

348
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,709
will lead you to the altar at Rheims,

349
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,112
where you will be crowned

350
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,430
the King...

351
00:40:57,840 --> 00:40:59,239
of France.

352
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:23,991
- Sire...
- I'm fine.

353
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,029
Jean d'Aulon,
my loyal friend and finest archer.

354
00:41:30,520 --> 00:41:34,433
Jean, I put her in your care.
Find her suitable lodgings

355
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:37,791
in the castle
and guard her with your life.

356
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,992
No lodgings
if we're to march on Orléans.

357
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:42,953
It has held out for 6 months,

358
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:47,039
a few days won't make a difference.
Take some rest.

359
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:56,269
Put the bags here.

360
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:02,229
Forgive me for pretending to be...

361
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,878
May I have some water?

362
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,151
Water? Yes, of course.

363
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,233
- Anything else?
- A priest.

364
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:12,632
Now?

365
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:15,952
Yes. I didn't confess today.

366
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:21,837
Anything else?

367
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:25,794
I shall also be needing
a new war horse, a sword,

368
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,879
armour and an artist to make a banner

369
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,519
- for me.
- Now?

370
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:32,673
Better today than tomorrow.

371
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:36,078
This might take a little time.

372
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,432
I'll see what I can do.

373
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,195
And someone who can

374
00:42:41,440 --> 00:42:42,589
read and write.

375
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:47,477
I can. I was studying in Paris
until the English invaded it.

376
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:48,829
Aren't you an archer?

377
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,109
Yes, I am.

378
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:54,597
Who can read and write.
Who is the letter for?

379
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,634
The King of England.

380
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,832
To give him the chance
to leave in peace,

381
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,671
before I get to Orléans.

382
00:43:15,920 --> 00:43:19,435
The Archbishop and I are negotiating
to bring the Burgundians

383
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:21,153
over to our side.

384
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,830
Negotiate,
but from a position of strength.

385
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:29,352
If the English take Orléans,
the whole country will be theirs.

386
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,635
My Lady,

387
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:34,037
it would be folly to let this... child

388
00:43:34,240 --> 00:43:36,993
lead our army in the King's name

389
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,316
without verifying her true motives.

390
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:40,794
Trémoïlle is right.

391
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:42,598
We must be certain

392
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,075
that she isn't
an instrument of the Devil.

393
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:46,156
How can anyone

394
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,352
be absolutely certain about anything?

395
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,157
Intuitions may be our best counsellors.

396
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,511
We must listen to our Church

397
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:58,517
before our intuitions.

398
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:04,872
Wait!

399
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:08,917
She claims to be a virgin.

400
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:12,555
That we can examine

401
00:44:12,880 --> 00:44:15,917
and be absolutely certain about.

402
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,639
Let's find out.

403
00:47:00,800 --> 00:47:02,392
What if she's not?

404
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:04,313
If she's not,

405
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,552
I'll kill her myself.

406
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:17,350
There is no sign

407
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:19,755
of corruption or violation.

408
00:47:20,320 --> 00:47:21,799
She is intact.

409
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,037
What exactly was this "vision" wearing?

410
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,353
I don't remember.

411
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,074
Did it give you anything,

412
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,909
an object, a ring, a rosary,

413
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,510
anything by which
we can verify your claim?

414
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,233
He gave me good advice.

415
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:43,350
As a child,

416
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:45,835
did you have any military experience?

417
00:47:47,240 --> 00:47:49,515
Can you wield the sword?

418
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,475
No, but I'm good with a stick.

419
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,031
Do you know what a Dijon Culverin is?

420
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:00,952
No.

421
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:02,639
An item of artillery.

422
00:48:02,840 --> 00:48:06,310
How do you expect to free Orléans
if you don't know?

423
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,036
The road to Orléans is long.

424
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:13,632
I have good captains with me.
I'll learn fast, believe me.

425
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:15,717
We would like to, Jeanne.

426
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:20,630
But if God wanted us to believe you,
he would have sent a sign

427
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,428
with you...

428
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:26,114
So, can you do something?

429
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:30,151
Show us something?

430
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,113
A sign

431
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:36,796
to prove that you are sent by God?

432
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:42,078
I didn't come here to perform tricks.

433
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,914
You are all much cleverer than I am.

434
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,440
Me, I don't know A from B,

435
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:52,517
but this much I do know:

436
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:56,715
While the people in France
lie bleeding,

437
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,109
you sit around in fine clothes,
trying to deceive me,

438
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:04,119
when you're only deceiving yourselves.

439
00:49:05,080 --> 00:49:07,230
You say you are men of God,

440
00:49:09,120 --> 00:49:11,873
yet you do not see
His hand guided me

441
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:14,753
through 500 leagues
of enemy country

442
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,757
to bring you His help.

443
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,516
Is that not proof enough?

444
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,116
Do you still need more signs?

445
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,878
Give me an army.

446
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:39,516
Take me to Orléans.

447
00:49:43,360 --> 00:49:46,033
There you'll see the sign
I was sent to make.

448
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:15,591
Dunois!

449
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:16,557
What?

450
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,274
A big one! Straight at us!

451
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:22,950
What side?

452
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:24,269
Window side.

453
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:39,509
Dunois!

454
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:40,670
What?

455
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,509
Good news!

456
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,956
Finally he's sending her to us.

457
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,230
Thanks be to God, we're saved!

458
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,111
It's wonderful!

459
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:52,040
Calm down, Xaintrailles.
Who's done what?

460
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,437
The Dauphin is sending us
supplies and an army,

461
00:50:55,640 --> 00:50:57,631
led by Jeanne,
the Maiden from Lorraine.

462
00:50:57,840 --> 00:50:59,398
Isn't it wonderful?

463
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,277
Yes, it's a miracle.

464
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:08,629
They're sending a woman!

465
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,590
What colour dress will she wear?

466
00:51:14,360 --> 00:51:14,872
Blue.

467
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,510
With a ribbon to tie up Talbot.

468
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,909
Does she even know how to ride

469
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:24,950
a horse?

470
00:51:25,600 --> 00:51:26,191
She knows.

471
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:40,955
Were you sent by Lord Dunois?

472
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:43,397
Yes, they were.

473
00:51:43,760 --> 00:51:44,431
Where are the English?

474
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:46,039
Everywhere. The food?

475
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,708
It's coming. I rode on ahead.

476
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:51,639
I have a message
for the English Captain.

477
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,114
- His name's Talbot.
- I know.

478
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:54,588
Can you take me to him?

479
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,711
He's on the other side of the river.

480
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:00,072
Who ordered
my being brought to this side?

481
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:05,115
My friend!
Good to see your ugly damn face again!

482
00:52:05,600 --> 00:52:08,273
- La Hire, don't swear!
- Sorry, Jeanne.

483
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:12,712
Let me introduce the King's
half brother, Lord Dunois.

484
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,157
Will you show me to the other side?

485
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:18,589
Wait...

486
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,912
Go now if you want, but not with me!

487
00:52:26,120 --> 00:52:27,314
You serve God,

488
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:30,637
but I serve my people,
who are starving!

489
00:52:32,080 --> 00:52:34,674
I'm taking the food back to the city.

490
00:52:34,880 --> 00:52:38,031
Calm down,
come with me to Orléans,

491
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,753
and I will welcome you.

492
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,552
Jesus Christ!

493
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:42,835
- The goddamn English will pay for this.
- They will.

494
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,600
So will you, if you go on swearing.

495
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:05,394
Welcome to my tavern.
Come on in.

496
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:10,390
La Hire,

497
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,159
Gilles, come and see!

498
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,838
The Tourelles are here...

499
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:28,909
Calm down!

500
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,111
You can't blame them.

501
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:34,114
- They've heard about you.
- There's nothing to hear.

502
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,435
Because I haven't done anything.
And why?

503
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,711
Because no one listens to me!

504
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,752
Why don't you join us.
We're about to discuss the campaign.

505
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:55,474
So from here, Talbot

506
00:54:55,680 --> 00:54:58,478
has spread his forces
between these forts.

507
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:02,673
But our scouts saw some troops
deployed to this fort.

508
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,237
What about this huge pile?

509
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:06,634
That's the Tourelle.

510
00:55:06,840 --> 00:55:10,196
They planned to attack from it,
but we destroyed the bridge.

511
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:11,674
I did!

512
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,996
It should keep them quiet for a while.

513
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:17,912
Now my hunch is:

514
00:55:18,640 --> 00:55:20,358
The attack will come from St Loup.

515
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,554
And what does Jeanne think?

516
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,152
I don't think.
I leave that to God.

517
00:55:27,360 --> 00:55:28,554
I'm nothing in all this,

518
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:30,194
I'm just a messenger.

519
00:55:30,520 --> 00:55:33,671
So?
What is the message?

520
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,275
We give the English...
a last chance to go home

521
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,431
- in peace.
- If they refuse?

522
00:55:41,160 --> 00:55:42,593
If they refuse...

523
00:55:45,080 --> 00:55:46,877
we recross the river

524
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:48,871
and attack

525
00:55:49,080 --> 00:55:50,195
here!

526
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:53,039
At the Tourelle.

527
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,512
That makes no sense!

528
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,077
The Tourelle is impregnable.
And if we are on the other side,

529
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:02,271
who will stop Talbot attacking

530
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:04,311
- from the north?
- God.

531
00:56:04,960 --> 00:56:07,076
God! Why, of course!

532
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:08,989
We'd forgotten about him.

533
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,549
I feel great sorrow for you.

534
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:20,190
You laugh, but by tomorrow,
some of you will be dead.

535
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,198
We can't just attack the Tourelle
like that.

536
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,472
- It's a complicated matter.
- Why?

537
00:56:26,840 --> 00:56:30,958
You only need to do what you're told.
What could be simpler?

538
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:33,198
I'm the drum on which

539
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,311
God is beating out his message.

540
00:56:35,520 --> 00:56:37,476
So hard it's bursting my ears!

541
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,789
Jeanne, it's not easy for us,
for our pride,

542
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,877
to suddenly be usurped by...

543
00:56:48,480 --> 00:56:50,789
with all due respect, by a...

544
00:56:52,960 --> 00:56:53,915
by a girl.

545
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:00,079
So, that's it.

546
00:57:01,280 --> 00:57:03,669
To you, I'm just...

547
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:05,630
a girl.

548
00:57:06,920 --> 00:57:09,229
Put yourself in my shoes.

549
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:11,269
How would you feel?

550
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:13,558
Knowing what I know?

551
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,239
Enormous gratitude.

552
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:23,277
One hell of a girl!

553
00:57:29,080 --> 00:57:30,513
I warned you!

554
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:38,389
I do love her
when her fire gets well and truly

555
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,158
- stoked.
- Me too.

556
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,996
Hello, my friends!

557
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:46,668
What a journey!

558
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:48,919
But we made it.

559
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:51,798
Let's have some fun.

560
00:57:56,080 --> 00:57:58,275
Fine. Let's look like a man.

561
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:05,836
Stop it!

562
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,829
How dare you stop God's will!

563
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:10,234
He never said cut your hair!

564
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:13,718
How dare you tell me
what God tells me to do!

565
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,911
Since He won't cut it Himself,

566
00:58:16,120 --> 00:58:17,997
let someone do it properly!

567
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:24,079
Raymond, bring the scissors.
Louis, fetch

568
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:25,190
the mirror.

569
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:30,075
Stop getting so angry.

570
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,874
- Calm down.
- I am calm!

571
00:58:33,080 --> 00:58:35,753
But God is angry.
I need to send a letter.

572
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:37,029
Now!

573
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,795
Fine.

574
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,757
<i>To you, Henry, King of England,</i>

575
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,635
<i>and you, Duke of Bedford,</i>
<i>who call yourself Regent of France,</i>

576
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:49,196
<i>obey the King of Heaven,</i>
<i>abandon your siege.</i>

577
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:54,315
<i>Give back the keys to the other towns</i>
<i>and go back to your island.</i>

578
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:58,069
<i>To you, Lord Talbot,</i>
<i>I beg you as humbly as I can,</i>

579
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:00,475
<i>for the sake of your soldiers' lives.</i>

580
00:59:00,680 --> 00:59:03,831
<i>Do not bring about your destruction.</i>
<i>Surrender to me,</i>

581
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:06,351
<i>Jeanne the Maiden,</i>
<i>sent here by God.</i>

582
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:11,159
Message!

583
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,874
<i>But if you refuse, we shall raise</i>

584
00:59:15,080 --> 00:59:16,479
<i>such a battle cry as there</i>

585
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:18,511
<i>hasn't been in France for 1000 years.</i>

586
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,911
Sire, a message.

587
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:32,029
<i>This is my third and last letter to you.</i>

588
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:35,152
<i>If still here at noon,</i>
<i>you will hear from me,</i>

589
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,351
<i>to your very great destruction.</i>

590
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,755
<i>Please, reply speedily.</i>

591
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,188
Go fuck yourself!

592
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,033
What did they say?

593
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:50,430
They will think about it.

594
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,075
Good.

595
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:56,154
But I don't think
they'll leave tomorrow.

596
01:00:00,320 --> 01:00:02,550
I can't wait for tomorrow!

597
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:31,032
French blood is spilling!

598
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:36,149
Wake up!

599
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:37,597
Hurry!

600
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:42,072
They've started without me!

601
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:51,352
There's a battle to fight
and a war to be won!

602
01:01:00,320 --> 01:01:01,753
Sound the retreat!

603
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:04,635
My banner!

604
01:01:12,640 --> 01:01:13,311
Open the gate!

605
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,719
What happened?

606
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:29,868
- Who ordered the attack?
- God knows.

607
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:32,111
- Bad idea.
- Were the men confessed?

608
01:01:32,320 --> 01:01:35,949
- Where are the priests?
- Left behind, to gain speed.

609
01:01:36,480 --> 01:01:38,277
Dunois, was it your order?

610
01:01:40,040 --> 01:01:40,950
Answer me!

611
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,628
- Later.
- Sooner is better than later.

612
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:48,317
Wait!

613
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:49,669
You'll be killed!

614
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:05,350
Follow me
and I will give you victory!

615
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,270
Close it!

616
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,153
Close the drawbridge!

617
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,878
To the drawbridge!

618
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,471
What is she doing?

619
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:45,069
To the drawbridge!

620
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,475
- It's closed!
- Not for long.

621
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:56,869
Let's go!

622
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:25,353
That's mine!

623
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,913
It's a great victory, Jeanne.
Your victory.

624
01:04:38,360 --> 01:04:39,110
But we must

625
01:04:39,320 --> 01:04:41,276
pursue the English
back to Talbot's camp.

626
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,038
Unless you have a better idea.

627
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,676
We find the biggest army we can
and return

628
01:04:47,080 --> 01:04:48,957
- to Orléans.
- The bridge was pulled down.

629
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:51,196
The English are rebuilding it.

630
01:04:51,400 --> 01:04:52,389
How do you know?

631
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:56,555
You've been with your council,
I've been with mine.

632
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,597
Come on, hurry up!

633
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,714
Careful with my baby!

634
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:03,839
That's the Tourelle.

635
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,270
Wonderful!

636
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:06,794
Captain!

637
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,558
The froggie whore's paying us a visit.

638
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,159
I'd better tell Glasdale.

639
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:23,753
Put the horses there!

640
01:06:28,360 --> 01:06:29,509
Fathers,

641
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,833
please bless them.
Bless them all.

642
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,995
Let's plan this attack more carefully.

643
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:53,519
Good idea.

644
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,469
Sire.

645
01:07:01,400 --> 01:07:03,834
We've got... visitors.

646
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:24,310
Glasdale!

647
01:07:26,440 --> 01:07:27,998
Do you hear me?

648
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:30,837
You call me a "whore",

649
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:34,432
I feel pity for you, for your soul,

650
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:36,676
and the souls of your men.

651
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:41,234
Yield!
Yield now to the King of Heaven!

652
01:07:42,440 --> 01:07:43,873
Or go back to your island!

653
01:07:44,520 --> 01:07:47,318
And you, go back to your pigsty!

654
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,473
Man the walls.

655
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:17,479
This morning,

656
01:08:18,720 --> 01:08:20,915
God gave us a great victory.

657
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:27,759
But it's nothing
compared to what He'll give us now.

658
01:08:28,880 --> 01:08:31,599
I know you are all tired and hungry.

659
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,071
But I swear to you

660
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:38,791
that even if the English were hanging
from the clouds by their fingertips,

661
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:41,230
we will pull them down by nightfall!

662
01:08:45,400 --> 01:08:47,391
