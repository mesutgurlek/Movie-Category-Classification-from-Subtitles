Tonight, I asked George Fitch
how the day went,

446
00:58:17,861 --> 00:58:19,556
and what progress they had made,

447
00:58:19,662 --> 00:58:22,324
and his reply was,

448
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:25,663
"It was hell today.
The blackest day of my life."

449
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:29,903
Certainly it was the same for me.

450
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:35,368
Tonight, a truck passed
in which there were eight or ten girls.

451
00:58:35,478 --> 00:58:38,743
<i>And as it passed,
they called, "Jo ming! Jo ming!"</i>

452
00:58:39,716 --> 00:58:41,445
"Save our lives!"

453
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,677
<i>RABE: Six Japanese
climb over my garden wall</i>

454
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:48,348
<i>and attempt
to open my gates from the inside.</i>

455
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:51,621
When I arrive and shine my flashlight
on the face of one of them,

456
00:58:51,728 --> 00:58:53,628
he reaches for his pistol.

457
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:56,722
But his hand drops quickly enough
when I yell at him

458
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:59,927
and hold my swastika armband
under his nose.

459
00:59:00,036 --> 00:59:04,405
Then, on my orders,
all six have to scramble back over the wall.

460
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:07,169
My gates will never be opened
to a riffraff like that!

461

494

<i>A moving picture was taken of this kind act.</i>

At the same time, a bunch of soldiers

climbed the back wall of the compound

<i>and would protect the good, of course</i>

<i>meant no more
than most of their statements.</i>

523
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:39,570
And to show their sincerity,
they raped, looted, and killed at will.

524
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:43,945
In these hard times,
it is certainly a life-saver to be in a gang.

525
01:03:45,121 --> 01:03:47,885
<i>The thing about the whole situation
that startles us all</i>

526
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:49,685
<i>is how we, unarmed handful of foreigners,</i>

527
01:03:49,792 --> 01:03:52,920
<i>can chase the Japanese soldiers
out of rooms in school buildings,</i>

528
01:03:53,029 --> 01:03:56,362
<i>rooms in foreign houses,
and rooms in Chinese homes.</i>

529
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,763
<i>And still, no one gets hurt.</i>

530
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:01,530
<i>The soldiers often actually run away.</i>

531
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,400
<i>Part of it is pure bluff.</i>

532
01:04:03,506 --> 01:04:06,441
If we batted an eye, we'd be done for.

533
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:09,239
Our group here at the house
drafted a message

534
01:04:09,345 --> 01:04:11,540
to the American Consulate General
in Shanghai,

535
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:14,514
asking that diplomatic representatives
be sent here immediately,

536
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,141
as the situation was urgent,

537
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:19,415
then asked the Japanese
to send it via Navy radio.

538
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:22,719
Needless to say, it was never sent.

539
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:26,522
<i>SMYTHE: When things were at their worst,
the fellows at our house remarked at supper,</i>

540
01:04:26,629 --> 01:04:27,789
<i>" The first fellow that gets killed,</i>

541

<i>" we're going to carry his body over
and put it in the Japanese Embassy."</i>

542
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:35,529
<i>Each night, the eight of us wonder
who would be missing the next night.</i>

543
01:04:35,638 --> 01:04:38,869
We said,
"We just can't all get through this alive."

544
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:43,543
At noon, a man was led to headquarters
with head burned cinder-black,

545
01:04:43,646 --> 01:04:46,206
eyes and ears gone, nose partly gone...

546
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,042
<i>A ghastly sight.</i>

547
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:53,781
I took him to the hospital in my car,
where he died a few hours later.

548
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,188
His story was
that he was one of the gang of some 100,

549
01:04:56,292 --> 01:04:57,759
who had been tied together,

550
01:04:57,860 --> 01:05:00,829
then gasoline thrown over them,
and set afire.

551
01:05:05,234 --> 01:05:09,102
December 24th, the day before Christmas.

552
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:13,699
About 10:00, I was called to my office
by a high military advisor.

553
01:05:14,377 --> 01:05:18,837
Miss Minnie Vautrin, our American Minnie,
a proper lady to the core...

554
01:05:19,715 --> 01:05:24,345
<i>She believes in her girls and guards them
the way a hen guards her chicks.</i>

555
01:05:24,453 --> 01:05:25,715
<i>I shall never forget her</i>

556
01:05:25,821 --> 01:05:28,881
<i>marching at the head of some
400 female refugees through the town,</i>

557
01:05:28,991 --> 01:05:32,324
<i>right past groups of vagabonding
Japanese soldiers,</i>

558
01:05:32,428 --> 01:05:36,626
to guide the refugees to the safety
of her girls' camp in Ginling College.

559
01:05:37,833 --> 01:05:40,301
And now, something terrible
has happened to our Minnie.

560
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:42,098
The request was

561
01:05:42,204 --> 01:05:46,766
that they be allowed to pick out
prostitute women from our 10,000 refugees.

562
01:05:46,876 --> 01:05:49,242
They said they wanted 100.

563
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:52,610
They feel that if they can start a regular,
licensed place for the soldiers,

564
01:05:52,715 --> 01:05:55,946
then they will not molest innocent
or decent women.

565
01:05:56,552 --> 01:05:59,612
And, with hands clenched in horror,
Minnie is forced to watch

566
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:04,216
as authorized underlings force their way
into her girls' assembly hall,

567
01:06:04,327 --> 01:06:06,795
filled with hundreds of good girls.

568
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:10,296
<i>She's not going to hand over
even one of them willingly.</i>

569
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:14,392
But then, a number of young refugee girls
step forward.

570
01:06:15,338 --> 01:06:17,533
Evidently, former prostitutes.

571
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:20,504
Minnie is speechless.

572
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:23,305
They finally secured 21.

573
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:26,313
But group after group of women
have asked me

574
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:30,579
if they will select the other 79
from the decent women and girls.

575
01:06:31,854 --> 01:06:33,651
And all I can answer is,

576
01:06:33,756 --> 01:06:37,385
"They will not do so
if it is in my power to prevent it."

577
01:06:40,463 --> 01:06:43,864
<i>SMYTHE: Bob Wilson helped out
at our house last night.</i>

578
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:46,833
<i>He got home early
for the first time in two weeks.</i>

579
01:06:46,936 --> 01:06:49,131
<i>So he went to the university gardens,</i>

580
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:53,265
brought six big poinsettias,
and put them around our living room.

581
01:06:53,376 --> 01:06:54,934
So we look like Christmas, anyway.

582
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:59,145
<i>RABE: Everyone is competing to make this
a happy Christmas for me.</i>

583
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,113
It's really touching.

584
01:07:01,217 --> 01:07:05,153
Chang brought some Christmas roses
and has decorated the house with them.

585
01:07:05,254 --> 01:07:08,485
He even managed to find a little fir tree
that he wants to decorate.

586
01:07:08,591 --> 01:07:10,559
And he just came in grinning with joy

587
01:07:10,659 --> 01:07:14,151
and carrying six very long candles
that he rounded up somewhere.

588
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:16,964
Everybody likes me, suddenly.

589
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:19,261
And it used to be, or so I thought,

590
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,394
that no one wanted
to have much to do with me.

591
01:07:22,905 --> 01:07:25,271
Or might I have been wrong there?

592
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:29,135
How strange, my dear Dora,
my dear children and grandchildren.

593
01:07:29,245 --> 01:07:31,907
I know you're all praying for me today.

594
01:07:33,249 --> 01:07:36,377
<i>I feel as if I'm surrounded
by loving thoughts.</i>

595
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:39,318
<i>Believe me,</i>

596
01:07:39,422 --> 01:07:42,755
I have a prayer in my heart
for all of you, as well.

597
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:46,123
<i>WILSON: It seems like anything
but Christmas Eve.</i>

598
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:49,890
<i>It is sort of tough to keep
Japanese soldiers from looting a hospital</i>

599
01:07:49,999 --> 01:07:53,594
<i>in the center of what was,
a few weeks ago, a great city,</i>

600
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:58,338
<i>while the rest of the family
is scattered all over the globe.</i>

601
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:01,001
<i>My baby will be six months old in four days,</i>

602
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:04,637
<i>and I have only seen her
for seven weeks of that time.</i>

603
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:06,738
<i>It would be pleasant to close the year</i>

604
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:09,113
<i>with some sort of
brighter outlook for the next,</i>

605
01:08:09,218 --> 01:08:12,483
<i>but we seem to be closing
on a note of deepest gloom,</i>

606
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,988
<i>without a glimmer of light ahead.</i>

607
01:08:15,691 --> 01:08:18,717
<i>The only consolation is that
it can't be worse.</i>

608
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:23,254
They can't kill as many people,
as there aren't any more to kill.

609
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:32,997
Christmas Eve, Nanking, China, 1937.

610
01:08:34,310 --> 01:08:37,677
What I am about to relate
is a story which I feel must be told,

611
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,214
even if it is seen by only a few.

612
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:43,107
<i>In these two short weeks,</i>

613
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:45,710
<i>we here in Nanking
have been through a siege.</i>

614
01:08:45,821 --> 01:08:49,917
<i>The Chinese army has left, defeated,
and the Japanese have come in.</i>

615
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:53,026
On that day, Nanking was still

616
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:57,691
<i>the beautiful city we were so proud of,
with law and order still prevailing.</i>

617
01:08:58,367 --> 01:09:03,532
<i>Today, it is a city laid waste, ravaged,
completely looted, much of it burned.</i>

618
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:07,404
<i>Complete anarchy has reigned for 10 days.</i>

619
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,470
<i>It has been a hell on earth.</i>

620
01:09:12,915 --> 01:09:16,146
Not that my life has been
in serious danger at any time,

621
01:09:16,252 --> 01:09:18,686
though turning lust-mad, drunken soldiers
out of houses

622
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:23,190
where they were raping the women
is not altogether a safe occupation.

623
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:25,226
Nor does one feel
perhaps too sure of himself

624
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:29,320
when he finds a bayonet at his chest
or a revolver at his head,

625
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:34,692
and knows it is handled by someone
who heartily wishes him out of the way.

626
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:39,333
<i>The Japanese army is anything but pleased
at our being here.</i>

627
01:09:39,441 --> 01:09:41,409
<i>They wanted no observers.</i>

628
01:09:42,178 --> 01:09:44,271
But to have to stand by,

629
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:47,816
while even the very poor are having
their last possessions taken from them,

630
01:09:47,917 --> 01:09:50,385
their last coin, their last bit of bedding,

631
01:09:50,486 --> 01:09:54,650
<i>while thousands of disarmed soldiers
who had sought sanctuary within,</i>

632
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:57,248
<i>together with many hundreds
of innocent civilians,</i>

633
01:09:57,359 --> 01:10:01,659
<i>are taken out before your eyes to be shot
or used for bayonet practice.</i>

634
01:10:02,431 --> 01:10:06,663
<i>And we have to listen to the sounds
of the guns that are killing them.</i>

635
01:10:07,803 --> 01:10:11,569
Over a thousand women kneel before you,
crying hysterically,

636
01:10:11,674 --> 01:10:16,111
begging you to save them
from the beasts who are preying on them.

637
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:19,909
To stand by and do nothing,
while your flag is taken down and insulted?

638
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:21,880
Not once, but a dozen times.

639
01:10:21,984 --> 01:10:24,452
And your own house is being looted?

640
01:10:25,421 --> 01:10:28,117
<i>And then to watch
the city you have come to love</i>

641
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:31,584
<i>and the institutions
to which you'd planned to devote your best</i>

642
01:10:31,694 --> 01:10:35,357
<i>deliberately and systematically
burned by fire?</i>

643
01:10:37,466 --> 01:10:40,367
This is a hell I had never before envisaged.

644
01:10:42,004 --> 01:10:44,529
And we keep asking ourselves,
"How long can this last?"

645
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,132
Day by day, we are assured by the officials
that things will be better soon,

646
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,303
that "we will do our best."

647
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:54,314
But each day
has been worse than the day before.

648
01:11:00,789 --> 01:11:04,325
(BELL TOLLING)

649
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,420
January 1st, a new year filled with hope.

650
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:14,699
(SINGING IN JAPANESE)

651
01:11:19,241 --> 01:11:21,903
There was a worship ceremony
at 8:30 this morning.

652
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:26,778
In the solemn air, the trumpets sounded,
and the Japanese flag was raised.

653
01:11:26,882 --> 01:11:31,251
<i>It is moving beyond words,
with the swords sparkling in the rising sun.</i>

654
01:11:33,155 --> 01:11:34,520
<i>We saluted the military flag,</i>

655
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:37,649
<i>gave three cheers
for our Emperor and Empress.</i>

656
01:11:38,627 --> 01:11:42,495
January 4. It is just three weeks
since Nanking was taken,

657
01:11:42,598 --> 01:11:46,625
and, as yet, there has been no foreigner
allowed in or out.

658
01:11:46,735 --> 01:11:50,637
The Japanese try to cover things up
wherever it's even vaguely feasible.

659
01:11:50,739 --> 01:11:52,934
And the ban on anyone entering or leaving

660
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:57,411
<i>is one of their ways of keeping the world
ignorant of Nanking's present state.</i>

661
01:11:58,580 --> 01:11:59,979
We have now received news

662
01:12:00,082 --> 01:12:04,109
that the Japanese want to close
all refugee camps on February 4th.

663
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:08,519
<i>The refugees are supposed to return
to the devastated city.</i>

664
01:12:08,624 --> 01:12:11,855
<i>And it doesn't matter
where they live amid the ruins.</i>

665
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:16,056
<i>This could be awful, but we don't know
how to avert this calamity.</i>

666
01:12:16,165 --> 01:12:18,599
The military has all the power.

667
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:25,968
At 3:00 p.m., two embassy police came
and asked us to get all the refugees together

668
01:12:26,075 --> 01:12:30,171
so they could explain to them
the plan of returning to their homes.

669
01:12:30,713 --> 01:12:35,412
A Chinese man was with them who
used to be a low-level Chinese army officer.

670
01:12:35,517 --> 01:12:39,317
In order not to be killed,
he became a Japanese collaborator.

671
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:45,092
When he was alone with Miss Vautrin,
he told her not to let the young girls go.

672
01:12:45,794 --> 01:12:47,591
He wept as he spoke.

673
01:12:47,996 --> 01:12:51,591
Their real object
is to get these people away from us,

674
01:12:51,700 --> 01:12:54,635
who have been their protection
during these terrible weeks.

675
01:12:55,104 --> 01:12:56,867
If they do not go back,

676
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:59,998
the refugees in camps
will be driven out by soldiers.

677
01:13:00,109 --> 01:13:02,600
<i>CHANG YU ZHENG: Some of the refugees
have registered and gone home,</i>

678
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,679
<i>hoping to live there peacefully.</i>

679
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,510
<i>But, unexpectedly,
when the refugees arrived home,</i>

680
01:13:07,616 --> 01:13:10,983
Japanese soldiers were seen,
hunting for women.

681
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:13,984
<i>VAUTRIN: I shall never bring pressure
on women to leave again.</i>

682
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:16,853
My experience on that was too bitter.

683
01:13:16,959 --> 01:13:21,862
One woman of 27, whom we urged
to go back to her husband,

684
01:13:21,964 --> 01:13:25,923
was raped by three soldiers
within three hours after she left us.

685
01:13:26,568 --> 01:13:28,331
I learned my lesson,

686
01:13:29,471 --> 01:13:31,803
and shall not easily forget it.

687
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:35,234
We have the possibility of a massacre.

688
01:13:35,344 --> 01:13:38,177
But I don't see myself staying out of sight
while soldiers use bayonets

689
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:40,248
on women and children who trusted us.

690
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,681
I scolded two Japanese soldiers.

691
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:47,618
The fellow in front was taking it all right,
but the one in back was a surly fellow.

692
01:13:47,723 --> 01:13:51,250
He drew his bayonet,
and then he made a pass at my middle.

693
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:53,328
I stood my ground.

694
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:55,294
But since his first pass was unsuccessful,

695
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:58,730
he took his bayonet
and held it to my neck for a moment.

696
01:13:58,834 --> 01:14:02,895
He muttered something in Japanese,
and jerked his bayonet forward.

697
01:14:03,005 --> 01:14:06,031
When I ducked my head back, it drew blood.

698
01:14:07,810 --> 01:14:11,507
<i>RABE: I fear that the military
intends to clear the Zone by force.</i>

699
01:14:13,182 --> 01:14:16,640
The middle paths are the only open spot
left in the garden.

700
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:18,947
As they come outside,
they all fall to their knees,

701
01:14:19,054 --> 01:14:21,887
and cannot be persuaded to get up
from the cold cement path

702
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:24,390
until I give the following speech.

703
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:27,729
"The Japanese have publicly announced

704
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:31,527
"that you must leave the refugee camps
in the Zone today.

705
01:14:32,568 --> 01:14:37,301
"I personally shall not chase you away,
but what can I, a single foreigner, do?

706
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:41,431
"Nonetheless, I'll try
to prevent the Japanese from entering."

707
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:57,521
When I return home in my car today,
I am received with a royal salute.

708
01:14:57,626 --> 01:15:00,595
My poor refugees
have formed two long lines.

709
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:05,429
Then all my 600 parishioners surround me
and give me a greeting written on a banner.

710
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:10,164
They all bow three times, and are very happy
when I bow my head in gratitude.

711
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:13,700
Then one of my Chinese friends
translates the greeting.

712
01:15:13,809 --> 01:15:18,303
You are the living Buddha
for 100,000 people.

713
01:15:18,413 --> 01:15:22,474
You have saved thousands of people
from danger and want.

714
01:15:22,584 --> 01:15:28,045
May the favor of heaven be granted to you.
May God's blessing rest upon you.

715
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:36,995
<i>RABE: As is obvious from the letters
that arrived for me yesterday</i>

716
01:15:37,099 --> 01:15:39,192
<i>from Shanghai via the German Embassy,</i>

717
01:15:39,301 --> 01:15:43,135
people there have not the vaguest notion
of current conditions here.

718
01:15:43,238 --> 01:15:45,172
And what do we do next?

719
01:15:45,274 --> 01:15:47,504
We've about shot our bolts.

720
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,772
<i>FITCH: At 6:40, I took the Japanese military
train to Shanghai.</i>

721
01:15:55,717 --> 01:15:59,483
<i>I was crowded in with about as unsavory
a crowd of soldiers as one could imagine</i>

722
01:15:59,588 --> 01:16:00,850
<i>in a third-class coach.</i>

723
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:04,949
Nervous, because sewed into the lining
of my camel's hair greatcoat

724
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:08,826
were eight reels of 16 mm movie film
of atrocity cases,

725
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:12,731
most of which were taken
at the university hospital by John Magee.

726
01:16:12,834 --> 01:16:16,565
They were so terrible
that they had to be seen to be believed.

727
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:19,903
My baggage would undoubtedly
be carefully examined by the military

728
01:16:20,008 --> 01:16:22,408
when we got to Shanghai.

729
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:25,105
What might happen,
if they discovered these films?

730
01:17:56,838 --> 01:17:57,998
The pictures shown herewith

731
01:17:58,106 --> 01:18:00,734
give but a fragmentary glimpse
of the unspeakable things that happened

732
01:18:00,842 --> 01:18:05,040
following the Japanese occupation
of Nanking on December 13, 1937.

733
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:08,976
<i>One must remember
that of the thousands injured,</i>

734
01:18:09,084 --> 01:18:13,248
<i>only a small percentage got to the hospital
or were even heard of.</i>

735
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:18,056
<i>These pictures have been taken
with no thought</i>

736
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:20,822
<i>of stirring up a spirit of hatred
against the Japanese,</i>

737
01:18:20,929 --> 01:18:26,458
<i>but only with the desire to make
all people realize how horrible war is.</i>

738
01:18:28,470 --> 01:18:31,906
Great care had to be exercised
not to be seen while taking pictures.

739
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:35,807
Otherwise, the camera
would have been smashed or confiscated.

740
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:40,143
Fortunately, the reels weren't discovered.

<i>Washington.</i>

742
01:18:42,718 --> 01:18:45,744
I was the guest of Undersecretary of State,
Dr. Stanley Hornbeck,

743
01:18:45,854 --> 01:18:47,185
whom I had known in China,

744
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:50,053
and I was given the opportunity
to see many people of importance.

745
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:52,649
And I also showed my films
to newspapermen

746
01:18:52,761 --> 01:18:54,956
and the Foreign Affairs Committee
of the House.

747
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:57,793
In Los Angeles,
a couple of speeches were lined up for me,

748
01:18:57,899 --> 01:19:01,027
<i>and one, where I showed my films,
caused something of a sensation,</i>

749
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:03,331
<i>even illness
on the part of a couple of the audience.</i>

750
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:07,506
And, following the meeting,
a Japanese gentleman approached me

751
01:19:07,642 --> 01:19:11,476
and said that my statements about
the atrocities in Nanking were not true.

752
01:19:11,580 --> 01:19:17,348
They could not be true,
for Japanese were incapable of such acts.

753
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:20,250
He asked me to retract
some of the things I had said,

754
01:19:20,355 --> 01:19:23,791
and intimated that it would be best for me
if I did so.

755
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:27,317
I told him that I had many Japanese friends

756
01:19:27,429 --> 01:19:31,024
and knew that most Japanese were
incapable of such acts as I had described.

757
01:19:31,133 --> 01:19:37,436
But, I said, unfortunately,
everything I said was true,

758
01:19:37,539 --> 01:19:39,973
and hence, I could retract nothing.

759
01:19:58,059 --> 01:20:01,460
The war has rolled on
to engulf a thousand other towns like ours.

760
01:20:01,563 --> 01:20:06,296
This story of invasion, massacre,
rape and oppression

761
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:09,767
will be reenacted among countless
communities in China.

762
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:14,736
<i>Nanking looks like a garden
that's been devoured by locusts.</i>

763
01:20:15,377 --> 01:20:18,346
The enemy creates a desert
and calls it peace.

At the conclusion of World War II,

765
01:20:24,719 --> 01:20:28,348
the Allies convened
a War Crimes Tribunal in Tokyo.

766
01:20:28,456 --> 01:20:30,117
<i>From the summary judgment,</i>

767
01:20:30,225 --> 01:20:33,285
<i>approximately 20,000 cases of rape
occurred in Nanking</i>

768
01:20:33,395 --> 01:20:36,296
