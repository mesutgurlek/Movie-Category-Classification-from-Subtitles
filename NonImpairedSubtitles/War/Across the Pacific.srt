is open.

00:01:30,824 --> 00:01:32,434
Yes, sir.

3
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:42,865
Captain Leland,

4
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:44,706
this court has carefully
considered your case

5
00:01:44,772 --> 00:01:46,922
and has reached its conclusions
based solely upon the evidence

6
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,210
introduced in open court
while you were present.

7
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:51,017
At the close of the evidence,
the court was closed,

8
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,514
and by secret written ballot

9
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,790
in which at least 2/3 of the
members of the court concurred,

10
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:56,475
the court has reached
its findings,

11
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,990
which are, of all specifications
and of all charges, guilty.

12
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,373
And again by
secret written ballot

13
00:02:01,389 --> 00:02:02,789
in which at least
2/3 of the members

14
00:02:02,823 --> 00:02:03,923
of the court concurred,

15
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:06,291
the court has decided upon
your punishment,

16
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:08,040
which is that you be
sentenced to dismissal

17
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,261
from the United States army

18
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:10,900
and to forfeit all pay
and allowances

19
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,434
now due or to become due,

20
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,580
this subject to the approval
of the reviewing authority.

21
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,082
Any further business
before the court?

22
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,306
Man: No, sir.

23
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:19,111
Do I hear a motion
for adjournment?

24
00:02:19,173 --> 00:02:20,573
Man: I move that
the court adjourn.

25
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:21,821
Second man:
I second the motion.

26
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,712
Any objections?
Apparently not.

27
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:26,207
Court is adjourned to meet
at the call of the president.

28

How about a game?

29
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:50,639
All right, Hansen,
but you and me

Man: I'll take a cue.

32
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:06,889
Well, captain...
Anything bothering you?

33
00:03:06,954 --> 00:03:08,604
There used to be a custom
in the British army

34
00:03:08,622 --> 00:03:10,822
when a man disgraced
his uniform.

35
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:12,461
Too bad we can't do it.

Well, Rick...

39
00:03:37,485 --> 00:03:38,925
An officer shouldn't
associate with one

40
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:41,292
who's been
dishonorably dismissed.

41
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,755
The regulations say so.

42
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:45,834
The adjutant gave
his permission.

43
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:53,634
In spite of the evidence,
I just can't believe.

44
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:56,671
Or if you did do it,
you must have had a reason--

45
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,937
well, one that you thought
was important.

46
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,536
Tell me.
I'm your friend.

47
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:03,009
It's all in the testimony.

48
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,646
Rick, I could have loaned you
the money, or part of it,

49

and there were others
who would have been glad.

You, of everybody I know.

52
00:04:17,725 --> 00:04:22,025
Well, I guess nobody ever
really knows anybody.

53
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,095
What are you going to do, Rick?

54
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,804
I'll probably go up to Canada.

55
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,366
They need artillerymen there.

56
00:04:27,435 --> 00:04:28,595
But, Rick...

57
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,075
Well, anyway, good luck.

58

00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:24,994

of both fixed and mobile
coastal guns,

including one year
in an antiaircraft battery.

68
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:31,808
Now, where were you stationed?

69
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,172
Two years at fort MacArthur,

That's right, sir.

Why, I'm sorry,
Mr. Leland,

78
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:49,164
but I believe at this time
we have a full complement

of coast artillery
officers of all ranks.

80

I thought the Canadian army
needed men of experience.

Oh, regardless of
his qualifications,

82
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:58,757
no one man is indispensable.

83

Maybe Chiang Kai-Shek
won't be so particular.

is to feel the deepest

moments when a blow comes on.

329
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:47,756
I wonder if it will
really get rough.

330
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:48,587
This is rough.

331
00:19:48,655 --> 00:19:49,755
Not nearly rough enough.

332
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,092
I want to go through something

333
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,657
I can talk about afterwards.

334
00:19:52,725 --> 00:19:53,655
You probably will,

335
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:56,656
but you may not want
to talk about it.

336
00:19:56,729 --> 00:19:58,869
I think there's something
elemental in a storm.

337
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,231
It appeals more
to women than to men.

338
00:20:01,301 --> 00:20:02,131
They're more
elemental--

339
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:02,941
than what?

340
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:05,202
Than women--men.

341
00:20:05,272 --> 00:20:07,172
I hope so, honey.
I'm your friend.

342
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,340
Ha ha ha.

343
00:20:08,408 --> 00:20:10,678
Ha! Some joke.

344
00:20:10,743 --> 00:20:13,213
I suppose I shouldn't smoke
my cigar right now.

345
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,980
No. Let her be happy
for a little while...

346
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:17,318
A little while.

347
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:18,564
Do you know what I'd like to do?

348
00:20:18,585 --> 00:20:19,665
I'd like to go up in the bow

349
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:21,519
if I had a man to hang on to.

350
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:25,058
I'm your man anyplace, even
the crow's-nest. Let's go.

351
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,664
Marlow: Excuse me,
gentlemen.

352
00:20:26,726 --> 00:20:28,226
Leland: Mmm.

353
00:20:28,295 --> 00:20:31,255
Better bring your coat.
Gentlemen.

354
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:38,569
[Speaking Japanese]

355
00:20:39,439 --> 00:20:41,769
[Speaking Japanese]

356
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,565
Whoo!
This is wonderful!

357
00:21:08,635 --> 00:21:10,965
What a figurehead you'd make.

358
00:21:11,037 --> 00:21:13,507
Look at the stern, the way
it goes up and down.

359
00:21:13,573 --> 00:21:15,983
It goes down so far you'd think
it would never come up again.

360
00:21:16,042 --> 00:21:18,082
And look at the way
the masts are going.

361
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:19,714
Don't look too long.

362
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,479
Keep your eyes off
the water below.

363
00:21:21,548 --> 00:21:23,078
Oh, I feel wonderful.

364
00:21:23,149 --> 00:21:24,679
You are wonderful.

365
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:27,191
I wish I had a better suit.

366
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:28,363
It doesn't matter
about the suit.

367
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:29,888
You have a kind face.

368
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:30,886
You think so?

369
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:32,787
Yes, I do, Rick.

370
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:35,529
That's the first time
you ever called me Rick.

371
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:37,095
Is it?

372
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,873
Yes.

373
00:21:46,639 --> 00:21:48,609
What's the matter?

374
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:51,212
Look, I didn't mean that.

375
00:21:51,277 --> 00:21:53,977
I did. Why didn't you?

376
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:56,781
A fella with a suit like mine

377
00:21:56,849 --> 00:21:59,849
shouldn't go around
kissing girls.

378
00:22:08,595 --> 00:22:11,425
See, I--
are you getting sick?

379
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,828
I don't know.

380
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:15,839
How do girls usually act
when you kiss them?

381
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:18,242
They don't turn green.

382
00:22:18,304 --> 00:22:19,714
Then I'm sick.
Get me out of here.

383
00:22:19,772 --> 00:22:21,572
Everything was going
so beautifully.

384
00:22:21,641 --> 00:22:24,811
Why did you have to eat
that bread pudding?

385
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,748
Oh, shoulda be,

386
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:31,275
the lady's been stabbed
by a bread pudding.

387
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,390
Do what you can for her.

388
00:22:32,452 --> 00:22:35,052
Bread pudding?
Too bad.

389
00:22:36,255 --> 00:22:37,885
Shoulda be.

390
00:22:41,494 --> 00:22:42,734
Ah, Mr. Leland.

391
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:48,599
Beating it?

392
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:50,998
Patience is a game one
only plays out of boredom,

393
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:54,670
which condition of mind
it does nothing to relieve.

394
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,011
Will you have a drink with me?

395
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:58,035
Thanks. I will.

396
00:23:15,194 --> 00:23:16,534
Have another.

397
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,466
I shouldn't.
I'm strapped.

398
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:19,871
Sorry to hear that,
Mr. Leland,

399
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:21,902
but what possible
bearing can that have?

400
00:23:21,968 --> 00:23:23,378
If the fella I'm
counting on in New York

401
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,572
doesn't kick through,

402
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:26,467
I won't be able
to buy you a drink.

403
00:23:26,539 --> 00:23:28,909
That doesn't alarm me greatly.

404
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:34,751
Miss Marlow dying.
Want to see Rick.

405
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,693
Excuse me.
I'll be right back.

406
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,930
I understand you're dying.

407
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:53,829
Yes.

408
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,940
You want to be buried at sea?

409
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:56,637
They have a very nice service.

410
00:23:56,703 --> 00:23:58,613
They stitch you up in a bag,
and you wouldn't like that.

411
00:23:58,638 --> 00:24:00,508
I'll have shoulda be
put you on ice.

412
00:24:00,573 --> 00:24:02,713
Very amusing.
A woman suffering.

413
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,535
Stop being such a baby.

414
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:05,781
Even if I do live,

415
00:24:05,845 --> 00:24:07,805
I'll never be the same again.

416
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,590
It happens to everybody
that eats bread pudding

417
00:24:09,616 --> 00:24:10,846
and looks at a mast.

418
00:24:10,917 --> 00:24:12,687
The mistake I made
was in kissing you.

419
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:14,522
I was all right till then.

420
00:24:14,587 --> 00:24:15,957
I resent that.

421
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:17,522
I'll never let you
kiss me again.

422
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,060
We won't argue.
You're not well,

423
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,985
and you don't know
what you're saying.

424
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:22,930
I do too.

425
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:23,895
Stop that!

426
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,073
Don't tell me you're the kind

427
00:24:25,097 --> 00:24:26,827
that goes to bed
with your shoes on.

428
00:24:26,899 --> 00:24:31,739
I need them on for suddenly
have to run down the hall.

429
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:34,974
All right, darling.
I'll humor you.

430
00:24:35,041 --> 00:24:37,481
Humor me?! Ha!

431
00:24:37,544 --> 00:24:38,854
When you're sitting
at the table tonight

432
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:40,308
eating your head off,

433
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:43,079
think of the girl whose
happiness you wrecked.

434
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:44,079
Yes, darling.

435
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,350
I pity the woman you ever marry.

436
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:47,718
I'll never get married.

437
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:50,187
The kind of a lover I am,
it wouldn't be fair.

438
00:24:50,256 --> 00:24:53,426
Any wife of mine would spend
her life running down hallways.

439
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,702
You aren't married,
are you, Rick?

440
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:57,097
No. Does that
make you feel better?

441
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:58,233
You make me sick.

442
00:24:58,297 --> 00:25:00,397
And if you stay here
one minute longer,

443
00:25:00,466 --> 00:25:01,996
I'll prove it to you.

444
00:25:05,772 --> 00:25:07,812
I take it our lovely
traveling companion

445
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,314
has a touch of mal de mer.

446
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,635
It was only a matter of time.

447
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:13,210
She speeded things up
by looking at the mast.

448
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,649
What a pity.

449
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:18,024
Yes. She doesn't look too
well with a green face.

450
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:40,865
From certain remarks
you dropped on deck

451
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:42,210
this morning,
Mr. Leland,

452
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,884
I gather you're
quite well-informed

453
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:47,313
in matters pertaining to
the United States Navy.

454
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,079
Yes, I know
a little bit about it.

455
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:51,448
You were perhaps in the Navy?

456
00:25:51,517 --> 00:25:54,287
No, coast artillery.
Army.

457
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:56,163
How interesting.

458
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:57,722
Not so interesting.

459
00:25:57,790 --> 00:26:00,460
Were you ever
stationed in Panama?

460
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:01,956
Part of the time.

461
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:05,358
I hope you don't think
I am too inquisitive.

462
00:26:05,431 --> 00:26:06,701
Not at all.
Not at all.

463
00:26:06,766 --> 00:26:08,396
You're furnishing the liquor.

464
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,597
It's hardly an excuse

465
00:26:09,669 --> 00:26:11,439
for asking a man his history.

466
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,643
I haven't got any history.

467
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:16,706
I was in the army.
I got kicked out.

468
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:18,476
I went up to Canada
and tried to enlist,

469
00:26:18,544 --> 00:26:19,484
and they wouldn't have me.

470
00:26:19,545 --> 00:26:21,005
I can't understand that.

471
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,080
It's perfectly simple.
They don't want men that--

472
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,879
have been kicked out
of another army.

473
00:26:24,951 --> 00:26:27,151
You're Frank, anyhow.

474
00:26:27,219 --> 00:26:28,149
I admire that quality.

475
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,590
Why shouldn't I be?
So-called facts.

476
00:26:32,659 --> 00:26:35,129
I'm known on every army post
in this hemisphere.

477
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:36,904
I understand how you feel,

478
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:38,403
but you can't afford
to be bitter

479
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,704
against your own countrymen,

480
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,626
particularly in
these troubled times.

481
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:42,901
Can't I?

482
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:45,299
How do you know
what I can afford?

483
00:26:45,371 --> 00:26:46,811
I'm sorry.

484
00:26:46,873 --> 00:26:49,913
I didn't mean to intrude
an unwanted opinion.

485
00:26:51,577 --> 00:26:53,847
OK, doc.

486
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:57,023
I'll hire out to whoever
will pay for my services.

487
00:26:57,083 --> 00:27:00,423
Chiang Kai-shek,
Hirohito...

488
00:27:00,486 --> 00:27:02,186
Anybody that will pay.

489
00:27:02,254 --> 00:27:04,394
I can't tell you how
I sympathize with you.

490
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,256
Were you stationed long
in the canal zone?

491
00:27:06,325 --> 00:27:08,085
Quite a while.

492
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,330
I served at Fort Amador
and fort Sherman.

493
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:12,226
I was attached to staff.

494
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:16,038
Amador guards the pacific
approach, doesn't it?

495
00:27:16,102 --> 00:27:17,302
Yeah.

496
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,471
I think I've had
too much to drink.

497
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:23,510
Have you?

498
00:27:23,575 --> 00:27:25,335
Can I help you,
Mr. Leland?

499
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,450
Sick. Need help.

500
00:27:33,519 --> 00:27:34,849
Go away.

501
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,487
Tea? Hold head?

502
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:39,756
Beat it.

503
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:44,130
Too much whiskey.
Very sick. Shoulda be.

504
00:27:44,196 --> 00:27:45,196
Beat it.

505
00:27:59,445 --> 00:28:00,845
Ha ha ha ha!

506
00:28:00,913 --> 00:28:03,553
This is the happiest
moment of my life.

507
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:04,875
My prayers have been answered.

508
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:07,521
Close the door when you leave.

509
00:28:07,586 --> 00:28:09,856
They have a nice burial at sea.

510
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:11,022
Go away, will you?

511
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:12,660
I want to die alone,
without a friend.

512
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:15,155
You will. Is there
anything I can do--

513
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:16,797
something to make you sicker?

514
00:28:16,863 --> 00:28:19,503
Just hang around.

515
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:20,995
Keep your shoes on.

516
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:23,097
I hope you'll need them.

517
00:28:23,169 --> 00:28:24,399
Ha ha ha ha!

518
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:05,114
Rick, before I get off
the gangplank,

519
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:08,107
are there any stray
hayseeds in my hair?

520
00:29:16,989 --> 00:29:19,059
Now, look, angel, I've got
to see a friend of mine.

521
00:29:19,125 --> 00:29:21,585
I think I can borrow some money.

522
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:23,430
You wait here for me.

523
00:29:33,472 --> 00:29:34,242
Only be a few minutes.

524
00:29:34,306 --> 00:29:35,306
Ok.

525
00:29:43,916 --> 00:29:45,476
Man: Here you are, folks,

526
00:29:45,551 --> 00:29:46,891
the collected ingenuity

527
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:48,993
of the 4 corners of
the earth for a quarter.

528
00:29:49,055 --> 00:29:50,555
25 cents apiece.

529
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,532
Each and every article is
unconditionally guaranteed.

530
00:29:52,558 --> 00:29:53,998
If you get them home
and they don't work,

531
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:55,996
bring them back.
I won't be here.

532
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:57,262
Here's something nice.

533
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,569
Take it home
to scare your friends.

534
00:29:58,597 --> 00:30:00,067
You won't have many friends.

535
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,742
What's the matter, Buddy?
You taking root there?

536
00:30:01,767 --> 00:30:05,537
Step right up, folks.
25 cents. 1/4 of a dollar.

537
00:30:05,604 --> 00:30:08,444
It amuses the kiddies.
It amazes the old folks...

538
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,493
Eighth floor.

539
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,000
Eight, please.

540
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:26,093
[Telephone rings]

541
00:31:26,152 --> 00:31:29,962
Atlas finance company.
One moment, please. Yes, sir?

542
00:31:30,022 --> 00:31:31,592
I'd like to see
Mr. hart.

543
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:32,667
May I have your name, please?

544
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:33,861
Leland.

545
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:37,456
He's expecting you.
Go right in. Yes.

546
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:46,473
Well, glad to see you,
captain Leland.

547
00:31:46,538 --> 00:31:47,268
Colonel hart.

548
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:49,309
Sit down.
Thank you.

549
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:51,875
Say, I had to duck a fellow
on the way up here--

550
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:54,254
white man, tall, thin,

551
00:31:54,313 --> 00:31:56,953
wore a long black
overcoat, derby hat.

552
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:58,076
I think I know the man.

553
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,920
We may soon pay him a visit.

554
00:31:59,986 --> 00:32:01,016
How did it go up north?

555
00:32:01,087 --> 00:32:02,817
Everything went
about as expected,

556
00:32:02,888 --> 00:32:04,958
but I must say
that their rejection

557
00:32:05,024 --> 00:32:06,234
of my army application

558
00:32:06,292 --> 00:32:09,202
was just a little bit
on the insulting side.

559
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,341
By the way, how did you manage
to get me on the boat?

560
00:32:11,363 --> 00:32:13,573
Your story was told
in the right quarters.

561
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:15,772
Dr. Lorenz was
well informed about you

562
00:32:15,834 --> 00:32:17,574
before you even came aboard.

563
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:18,966
Now, there's a girl--

564
00:32:19,038 --> 00:32:20,668
yes, I know. We've been
checking on her,

565
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:22,869
but from what I hear, I
don't think she's the type.

566
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,341
Would she be there
if she weren't?

567
00:32:24,410 --> 00:32:26,380
Possibly, but I doubt it,

568
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:28,175
however, that's up
to you to find out.

569
00:32:28,247 --> 00:32:30,917
What's she like, captain?

570
00:32:30,983 --> 00:32:32,423
Well, uh...

571
00:32:32,484 --> 00:32:33,904
Remember the girl you
used to dream about

572
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,689
when you were 19?

573
00:32:35,754 --> 00:32:37,524
Why, very well.

574
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,229
This is her in the flesh.

575
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,861
I see.

576
00:32:40,926 --> 00:32:42,426
How are you
and the genial doctor

577
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:43,064
getting along?

578
00:32:43,129 --> 00:32:44,499
Famously, I'd say.

579
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,633
Well, don't take
too much for granted.

580
00:32:46,698 --> 00:32:47,998
Lorenz is no chump,

581
00:32:48,067 --> 00:32:49,377
or he wouldn't
have lasted so long.

582
00:32:49,401 --> 00:32:52,201
He may be just
giving you enough rope.

583
00:32:52,271 --> 00:32:54,021
Another thing, captain,
remember, on shipboard,

584
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:55,970
anything
can happen to a man--

585
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:58,042
a box drops on your skull,

586
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,150
a wave washes you overboard.

587
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:00,578
I'll be careful.

588
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:02,056
You're going to have
a new shipmate tonight.

589
00:33:02,081 --> 00:33:03,321
Getting aboard is a young man

590
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:06,552
by the name of Totsuiko,
Joe Totsuiko,

591
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:09,458
a member of the
Kokuryu-Kai, and tough.

592
00:33:09,521 --> 00:33:10,521
A jap gunsel,

593
00:33:10,556 --> 00:33:12,656
so watch out
if you bump into him.

594
00:33:12,724 --> 00:33:13,894
Yeah, I'll do that.

595
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,259
There's one other item.

596
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,527
The details of your disgrace

597
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:17,995
have been widely circulated

598
00:33:18,064 --> 00:33:19,534
in Panama and
across the pacific,

599
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:21,568
so you won't be
welcomed, exactly,

600
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:22,473
with open arms.

601
00:33:22,534 --> 00:33:24,104
I'll be on my own down there?

602
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:27,340
Smith is expecting you.
No one else knows.

603
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:28,906
Some big things
are brewing, captain.

604
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:31,184
We have reason to believe
they'll boil over soon.

605
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:33,453
We don't know how soon
or what side of the pot,

606
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,312
but they're sure
to involve the canal,

607
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:36,751
and that's where you come in

608
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,845
because Lorenz may or
may not be the key man.

609
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:41,618
It's up to you to find out.

610
00:33:41,687 --> 00:33:42,347
Success.

611
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:43,821
Thank you.

612
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:45,459
I hope you and the girl

613
00:33:45,524 --> 00:33:47,464
I wanted to marry when I was 19

614
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:51,156
have a nice lunch together.

615
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,160
Good-bye, sir.

616
00:33:52,231 --> 00:33:53,401
Good-bye.

617
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:14,194
Who's your friend?
I don't know.

618
00:34:14,253 --> 00:34:16,893
I hate to complain, but
he's been pretty nasty.

619
00:34:16,955 --> 00:34:17,955
Yeah? About what?

620
00:34:18,023 --> 00:34:20,393
The usual thing.

621
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,098
Do you want to meet this lady?

622
00:34:28,167 --> 00:34:29,097
No.

623
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:30,068
She was under the impression

624
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:31,666
you wanted to talk to her.

625
00:34:31,737 --> 00:34:34,607
Not me. I guess I was just
reciting something to myself.

626
00:34:34,673 --> 00:34:36,813
Why don't you recite
something to me?

627
00:34:36,875 --> 00:34:38,805
I don't know what
you're talking about.

628
00:34:38,877 --> 00:34:41,377
I got to get going.

629
00:34:41,447 --> 00:34:42,877
It's not polite to walk out

630
00:34:42,948 --> 00:34:44,548
on a lady like that.

631
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:45,876
First you say you're sorry,

632
00:34:45,951 --> 00:34:47,851
then
you say good-bye.

633
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,659
I beg your pardon, lady.
I guess I mistook you

634
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,072
for a girl who
used to come in here

635
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,660
and sit all the time.

636
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:54,855
It won't happen again.

637
00:34:58,897 --> 00:34:59,727
Why didn't you really hit him?

638
00:34:59,798 --> 00:35:00,798
Were you afraid of him?

639
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,002
No. He had my number.

640
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:03,397
Did you get your money?

641
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:05,639
Yeah. More than I expected.
Did I talk fast!

642
00:35:05,704 --> 00:35:08,814
In that case, you're going
to get yourself a new suit.

643
00:35:11,510 --> 00:35:14,010
This has been
some day for a girl
from medicine hat.

644
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,309
Is that a gag, or do you really

645
00:35:15,381 --> 00:35:16,491
come from a place
called medicine hat?

646
00:35:16,515 --> 00:35:18,615
What's wrong with medicine hat

647
00:35:18,684 --> 00:35:20,634
it's hot in summer
and cold in winter,
nothing ever happens there.

648
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:22,822
You happened there.
That's good enough for me.

649
00:35:22,888 --> 00:35:24,458
By any chance, are you
a woman of means,

650
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:25,963
by any chance, I hope?

651
00:35:26,024 --> 00:35:27,294
My father's a farmer.

652
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:32,159
I work in a 10-cent store.
I sell peanut brittle.

653
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,595
Oh, I see, you whipped up
the gaudy garments you wear

654
00:35:36,668 --> 00:35:37,998
on the family sewing machine.

655
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:39,209
I suppose I'm on
your blacklist now.

656
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:40,608
Oh, no. I'm used
to bad luck.

657
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,342
It'll probably end up
with captain higoto

658
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:43,438
marrying us on the boat.

659
00:35:43,509 --> 00:35:45,379
Oh, no. I want
a church wedding

660
00:35:45,444 --> 00:35:47,854
and a groom who has
more than two suits.

661
00:35:49,815 --> 00:35:53,115
How long were you
in Panama, Rick?

662
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:54,315
About 4 years.

663
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:55,586
Did you ever hear of a man

664
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:58,794
by the name of Morton--
Dan Morton?

665
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:02,287
Yeah. Yeah. He's
a planter, isn't he?

666
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:03,961
Lot of dough. Why?

667
00:36:04,029 --> 00:36:06,269
He's related to some
friends of mine.

668
00:36:06,332 --> 00:36:07,402
You'd better look him up.

669
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:08,546
He might take a fancy to you

670
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:11,300
and leave you all his money.

671
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,850
I'm not so obsessed with
money as you seem to be.

672
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:13,871
I can do without it.

673
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,339
You stick around with me,

674
00:36:15,407 --> 00:36:17,807
and you're going to get
plenty of practice.

675
00:36:19,345 --> 00:36:21,545
We can walk to the pier.
You ought to
save your money.

676
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:25,623
This is no time to
be a pinchpenny.
I'm wooing a girl.

677
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,654
Pier 16.

678
00:36:31,657 --> 00:36:33,427
Someone should tell
our little friend

679
00:36:33,492 --> 00:36:36,192
that tight overcoats
and guns
don't go together.

680
00:36:36,262 --> 00:36:38,262
He's liable to get
picked up by a cop.

681
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,867
Pier 16.

682
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:15,813
If we'd known
he was coming here,

683
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:18,674
we could have given him a lift.

684
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:26,712
What's up, Rick?

685
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,545
You stay here.

686
00:37:31,617 --> 00:37:33,557
You can't dump me
like this. Something's
going to happen.

687
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:38,715
Now, go back. Don't be
an innocent bystander.
They always get hurt.

688
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:10,991
You all right, doc?

689
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:12,516
Yes.

690
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:28,342
You know him?

691
00:38:28,407 --> 00:38:30,277
I don't think so.

692
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:31,942
At any rate, he isn't
a close friend.

693
00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,050
OK, then, we better
send for the police.

694
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:38,622
If you don't mind,
I'd prefer that you
didn't. Miyuma.

695
00:38:38,684 --> 00:38:41,024
[Speaking Japanese]

696
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,087
If the police were
called in, there might
be an investigation.

697
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,000
Might not be able to sail.

698
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:53,202
It's none of
my business what
you do with him.

699
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,704
He wasn't shooting at me.

700
00:38:54,766 --> 00:38:56,566
I can never
thank you enough,
Mr. Leland.

701
00:38:56,635 --> 00:38:58,345
Oh, skip it, doctor.
I was just coming on board

702
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,870
and practically
stumbled over the guy.

703
00:39:00,939 --> 00:39:02,539
How you doing, angel?

704
00:39:02,608 --> 00:39:06,208
I think I got pushed
in the face by somebody.
My lipstick smeared.

705
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,907
Aw, you look cute.

706
00:39:07,979 --> 00:39:11,449
And now if you'll excuse me,
I'll go to my cabin...

707
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:13,077
And faint.

708
00:39:14,986 --> 00:39:18,416
I hope no more of
your homicidal friends
are on the pier.

709
00:39:18,490 --> 00:39:20,660
Standing so close to you
might be bad luck.

710
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:24,496
First officer miyuma
is taking care of that.

711
00:39:38,410 --> 00:39:41,550
[Gunshot]

712
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,083
You weren't kidding.

713
00:39:43,148 --> 00:39:44,378
I suppose you're wondering

714
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:45,630
about this
little incident,
Mr. Leland.

715
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:47,221
No, not particularly.

716
00:39:47,285 --> 00:39:49,085
As you know,
I'm a resident of
the Philippines.

717
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:51,820
In fact, I consider
myself a Philippine
national.

718
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,790
And what do the Filipinos
consider you?

719
00:39:53,859 --> 00:39:55,859
It's unfortunate
that some of
my fellow citizens

720
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:58,857
resent my
realistic attitude
toward Japan.

721
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,830
A few of them
even go so far as
to call me traitor.

722
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,970
That misguided
little man in
the long overcoat

723
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:08,565
undoubtedly believed
he was acting on
patriotic principles.

724
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:18,248
Whatever he believed,

725
00:40:18,316 --> 00:40:20,346
he believed pretty strongly.

726
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:22,418
If I were you,
just from a health
standpoint,

727
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:24,218
I think I'd give up the japs.

728
00:40:24,289 --> 00:40:27,189
I'm afraid my ties with
the Japanese are rather
too close for that:

729
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,258
Financially, spiritually,
ideologically,
and otherwise.

730
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:32,698
If those ties involve
some personal danger,
I don't mind,

731
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,574
considering the ultimate reward.

732
00:40:34,633 --> 00:40:36,513
Well, then,
if you don't mind,
I shouldn't mind either.

733
00:40:36,535 --> 00:40:39,535
I'm being Frank with
you, Mr. Leland, because
you saved my life.

734
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:42,205
Naturally, anything I say
is in confidence.

735
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,083
Naturally.

736
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:54,658
All that worries me
is that I came
on this trip

737
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:56,116
for my health and pleasure,

738
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:57,957
but I seem
to have come to
the wrong place.

739
00:40:58,023 --> 00:41:00,363
I never saw such
a gunned-up boat
in my life.

740
00:41:00,425 --> 00:41:01,855
Really?

741
00:41:01,927 --> 00:41:03,857
Yes. Your little
Filipino friend
had a gun.

742
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:05,859
Sugi's got a gun,
and that wasn't
an apple

743
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:08,531
the first officer
was holding
in his pocket.

744
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,370
You got a gun?

745
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:11,765
Even I, Mr. Leland.

746
00:41:14,873 --> 00:41:16,583
Mine's bigger than yours.

747
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:19,312
I usually like
to keep this locked
up in my suitcase,

748
00:41:19,377 --> 00:41:22,747
but with all these
guns around, what's
a fella going to do?

749
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:24,584
I wouldn't worry
about it if I were you.

750
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:26,090
In fact, I wouldn't even
think about it.

751
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:27,347
Thanks for the tip.

752
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,498
Did you and miss Marlow
have a good time in New York?

753
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,520
Wonderful.

754
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:30,955
Saw your man, got your money?

755
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:34,492
I got it. Miss Marlow
made me spend it
on a new suit.

756
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:35,860
It's very handsome.

757
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:38,427
Yes. She seemed to think
it made some improvement.

758
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,866
Well, I'll be hitting the hay.

759
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:41,381
If anybody else
starts throwing
slugs at you, doc,

760
00:41:41,399 --> 00:41:43,099
don't forget to duck.

761
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:46,368
I believe I'll be
a little better
prepared. Thank you.

762
00:41:46,437 --> 00:41:47,237
Good night.

763
00:41:47,305 --> 00:41:48,305
Good night.

764
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:55,151
Hey.

765
00:41:56,815 --> 00:41:59,475
Am I nuts, or did I
hear some shooting
a few minutes ago?

766
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,791
Did I miss anything?

767
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,822
Firecrackers.
Chinese new year's.

768
00:42:02,888 --> 00:42:04,758
Maybe I am nuts,
but it sounded to me

769
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:07,133
like those firecrackers
were shot from a muzzle.

770
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:10,232
My name's Joe Totsuiko.
Rick Leland.

771
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:13,155
I'm sure glad
there's someone around
that speaks my language.

772
00:42:13,231 --> 00:42:15,501
I'm rooming with
that dope named T. Oki.

773
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:19,367
He's got his lip
buttoned up for good
as far as I can figure out.

774
00:42:19,437 --> 00:42:21,567
Where you bound for?
The orient.

775
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:23,340
Me, too. My old man's
sending me down there

776
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:25,208
to work for one of my uncles.

777
00:42:25,276 --> 00:42:28,676
Say, I wonder if those
Panamanian mamas are all
they're cracked up to be.

778
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:30,617
Terrific, Joe, simply terrific.

779
00:42:30,682 --> 00:42:31,832
Well, I'll see you
around, Ricky.

780
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,250
Yeah. Take it
easy, Joe.

781
00:42:53,972 --> 00:42:55,642
Without knocking.
Where's your modesty?

782
00:42:55,707 --> 00:42:56,907
What's going on on this boat?

783
00:42:56,975 --> 00:42:57,675
Nothing's going on on this boat.

784
00:42:57,743 --> 00:42:59,413
Shh! Not so loud.

785
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:02,607
Well, that is, nothing
except an attempted
assassination.

786
00:43:02,681 --> 00:43:05,421
But why get so excited
about a little thing
like that?

787
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:08,093
Who are you after?
Are you a g-man
or something?

788
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:09,223
What if I was?

789
00:43:09,287 --> 00:43:11,057
I just wondered.

790
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:13,222
Look, I'm just
a private citizen,

791
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:14,891
and I happened
to be passing a room

792
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:17,460
where one guy was trying
to bump off another guy,

793
00:43:17,528 --> 00:43:19,698
which, as you know,
happens to be
against the law.

794
00:43:19,765 --> 00:43:21,165
Happened to be passing.

795
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:23,112
You followed
our little friend
in the tight overcoat,

796
00:43:23,134 --> 00:43:24,914
and then you lied to
Dr. Lorenz about happening
to stumble over him,

797
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,106
you can't do that to me.

798

If it'll make you happy,
I'm J. Edgar hoover.
Here's my badge.

799
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,141
Some joke. Mr. Leland,
I believe that a man

800
00:43:32,210 --> 00:43:34,710
should tell the woman
he's going to marry
everything.

801
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,750
Oh, in that case,
I'll come clean.

802
00:43:36,815 --> 00:43:38,445
[Bell ringing]

803
00:43:38,516 --> 00:43:40,446
I look old,
but that's because
I've worried a lot.

804

I think it's time you began

1118
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,861
to earn your money.

1119
01:01:14,438 --> 01:01:15,868
Ah, hot!

1120
01:01:18,542 --> 01:01:21,482
Ok, doc, where do we begin?

1121
01:01:21,545 --> 01:01:22,705
Pedro Miguel locks

1122
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:24,650
will be a good place
for a starter.

1123
01:01:24,715 --> 01:01:25,835
How many batteries are there?

1124
01:01:25,883 --> 01:01:27,283
What are their caliber?

1125
01:01:28,753 --> 01:01:30,523
Antiaircraft or heavy stuff?

1126
01:01:30,587 --> 01:01:32,317
Begin with
the 16-inch guns.

1127
01:01:32,389 --> 01:01:33,689
Now, let's see.

1128
01:01:33,758 --> 01:01:35,858
The last time I was
down here 2 years ago,

1129
01:01:35,926 --> 01:01:36,826
there were double railway guns

1130
01:01:36,894 --> 01:01:38,504
east and west,

1131
01:01:38,562 --> 01:01:40,802
two twin concrete
embrasures half a mile
to the north,

1132
01:01:40,865 --> 01:01:43,365
one 4-gun turret of
shore-mounted navies

1133
01:01:43,433 --> 01:01:44,333
back of hill 14.

1134
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:45,241
But what's the idea?

1135
01:01:45,302 --> 01:01:47,272
You know all that already.

1136
01:01:47,337 --> 01:01:48,507
Testing me, eh?

1137
01:01:48,572 --> 01:01:49,942
You examined the money
I gave you?

1138
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:52,377
That's right.
Do we go on?

1139
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:53,512
We go on.

1140
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:55,007
What specific knowledge have you

1141
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:57,409
of the military plane patrol
over the canal area?

1142
01:01:59,683 --> 01:02:02,323
Well...2 years ago--

1143
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:04,546
what happened 2 years ago
doesn't interest me.

1144
01:02:04,621 --> 01:02:07,221
What I want is the current
schedule of the patrol planes.

1145
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:10,861
When the flights take off,
exactly what areas they cover,

1146
01:02:10,928 --> 01:02:12,708
what altitude they conduct
their reconnaissance,

1147
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:14,629
and the precise time
of their return.

1148
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:15,868
[Knock on door]

1149
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:18,266
Ice water, sir.

1150
01:02:37,922 --> 01:02:40,022
That's going
to take some getting.

1151
01:02:40,090 --> 01:02:41,690
I'll pay generously for it.

1152
01:02:41,758 --> 01:02:44,558
How much?
Shall we say $500?

1153
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:46,728
Shall we say $1,500?

1154
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:48,227
I said I'll pay generously,

1155
01:02:48,298 --> 01:02:49,028
not foolishly.

1156
01:02:49,099 --> 01:02:50,229
Now, just a minute.

1157
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,580
The only place I can
get that information

1158
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:52,541
is air force headquarters,

1159
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,772
and that won't be easy.

1160
01:02:53,838 --> 01:02:55,268
It may take almost
a week of trying

1161
01:02:55,339 --> 01:02:56,899
before things begin
to break just right.

1162
01:02:56,941 --> 01:02:58,111
I'll make you a deal--

1163
01:02:58,175 --> 01:03:01,445
1,500 if you get it
by 5:00 today.

1164
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,651
5:00? Why all the rush?

1165
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:04,713
There's no rush.

1166
01:03:04,748 --> 01:03:06,378
Just $1,000 worth, eh?

1167
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:07,890
Remember, Mr. Leland,

1168
01:03:07,952 --> 01:03:10,192
it's your place to answer
questions, not to ask them.

1169
01:03:10,254 --> 01:03:11,664
Sorry. I--I'm
a little new

1170
01:03:11,721 --> 01:03:12,661
at this game.

1171
01:03:12,722 --> 01:03:15,032
Of course, of course.

1172
01:03:15,092 --> 01:03:16,762
Oh, and by the way,

1173
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:19,097
don't get the ingenious
idea of selling me out

1174
01:03:19,163 --> 01:03:21,473
to the American authorities.

1175
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,531
It wouldn't pay...

1176
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:24,900
In the long run.

1177
01:03:49,093 --> 01:03:51,033
Marlow: Wait a minute!

1178
01:03:53,397 --> 01:03:54,127
Who is it?

1179
01:03:54,198 --> 01:03:56,168
It's me.

1180
01:03:56,233 --> 01:03:57,873
How you doing?
All right.

1181
01:03:57,935 --> 01:03:58,865
You happy?
Very.

1182
01:03:58,936 --> 01:03:59,736
What's the program?

1183
01:03:59,803 --> 01:04:01,143
I'm free as a bird.

1184
01:04:01,205 --> 01:04:02,615
I've got a couple of
things to attend to.

1185
01:04:02,639 --> 01:04:04,019
I'll meet you at
the international bar

1186
01:04:04,041 --> 01:04:05,281
at 1:00.
How do I get there?

1187
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:08,252
Tell any cab driver.
Come as you are.

1188
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:37,746
What can I do for you, sir?

1189
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,137
I want to open an account.

1190
01:04:39,209 --> 01:04:41,079
Sit down, please.
Thank you.

1191
01:04:41,145 --> 01:04:42,345
Savings or checking?

1192
01:04:42,412 --> 01:04:43,612
Savings.

1193
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,680
And, uh, what is the name?

1194
01:04:45,749 --> 01:04:48,149
Leland.
Richard Leland.

1195
01:04:48,218 --> 01:04:50,788
Will you sign there, please?

1196
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:52,194
Mm-hmm.

1197
01:04:59,163 --> 01:05:02,403
There you are.

1198
01:05:02,466 --> 01:05:04,936
How much did you wish
to deposit?

1199
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:08,242
$1,241.00

1200
01:05:08,305 --> 01:05:11,035
no one can get close
enough to hear us
without our seeing them.

1201
01:05:11,108 --> 01:05:13,108
Go ahead with your report,
captain Leland.

1202
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:18,351
Lorenz is hooked.
I'm on his payroll--
$350 worth.

1203
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:20,345
He must think
you're very valuable.

1204
01:05:20,417 --> 01:05:21,917
What have you got?
Not much.

1205
01:05:21,986 --> 01:05:23,186
Lorenz seems to be head man.

1206
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,193
They switched his valet
in New York.

1207
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:27,515
The new T. Oki could
be a naval officer.

1208
01:05:27,591 --> 01:05:28,831
He is.

1209
01:05:28,892 --> 01:05:30,372
Have you any idea
what Lorenz is up to?

1210
01:05:30,394 --> 01:05:31,864
No, but I've got a hunch

1211
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:32,968
that whatever is going to happen

1212
01:05:32,997 --> 01:05:34,297
will happen soon.

1213
01:05:34,364 --> 01:05:35,934
He offered me the family jewels

1214
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,340
for the canal patrol
flight schedule,

1215
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:38,367
and he wants it quick.

1216
01:05:38,402 --> 01:05:39,772
Well, we could
hardly afford--

1217
01:05:39,836 --> 01:05:40,876
I think it's worth the gamble

1218
01:05:40,904 --> 01:05:42,014
to keep his confidence.

1219
01:05:42,072 --> 01:05:44,012
Hmm. We could make up
a fake schedule.

1220
01:05:44,074 --> 01:05:45,584
Yes, we could,
but all he'd have to do

1221
01:05:45,642 --> 01:05:47,412
would be to get
a pair of binoculars

1222
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:49,547
and a watch to find out
he'd been tricked.

1223
01:05:49,613 --> 01:05:51,523
No. I think we'd better
give him the real dope.

1224
01:05:51,581 --> 01:05:53,261
I'll phone you if things
get to looking dirty,

1225
01:05:53,283 --> 01:05:56,453
and you can always
change the schedule.

1226
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:57,920
Very well.

1227
01:05:57,988 --> 01:05:59,158
Under the circumstances,

1228
01:05:59,223 --> 01:06:01,493
I suppose it wouldn't be
too dangerous.

1229
01:06:01,558 --> 01:06:02,558
We hardly think

1230
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:04,066
they'd keep those two men
in Washington

1231
01:06:04,094 --> 01:06:06,104
I they intended
to pull a fast one.

1232
01:06:08,698 --> 01:06:10,068
Shoulda be.

1233
01:06:10,134 --> 01:06:11,174
I beg your pardon?

1234
01:06:11,235 --> 01:06:12,465
Now, about the schedule.

1235
01:06:12,536 --> 01:06:14,076
Oh, yes. I'll have
a copy of the schedule

1236
01:06:14,104 --> 01:06:16,344
at your hotel this afternoon.

1237
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:18,736
Any more dope about the
girl from medicine hat?

1238
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:20,778
Yes. She never
lived there.
She's a new yorker,

1239
01:06:20,844 --> 01:06:22,654
a buyer for Rogers fifth Avenue.

1240
01:06:22,712 --> 01:06:25,152
She's made 8 trips abroad
in the last 2 years.

1241
01:06:25,215 --> 01:06:27,275
Of course, that could
be part of her work.

1242
01:06:27,351 --> 01:06:28,751
Hmm.

1243
01:06:28,818 --> 01:06:31,358
Well...

1244
01:06:31,421 --> 01:06:35,091
I guess that slams
the door on miss Marlow.

1245
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:36,529
Funny thing, though.

1246
01:06:36,593 --> 01:06:38,303
She pointed out
the oki switch to me.

1247
01:06:38,362 --> 01:06:41,772
Sometimes the best way
to gain a confidence
is to give one.

1248
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,481
What have you got
on a fella
named Dan Morton?

1249
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:47,300
Owns a plantation here
called "bountiful."

1250
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:49,041
Morton.

1251
01:06:51,041 --> 01:06:54,811
Age: 55 to 60.
Came here in '31.

1252
01:06:54,878 --> 01:06:56,808
Heavy drinker.
Bit of a dipsomaniac.

1253
01:06:56,880 --> 01:06:58,350
May be a little cracked.

1254
01:06:58,415 --> 01:07:00,445
His plantation
has been profitable.

1255
01:07:00,517 --> 01:07:03,087
Has substantial accounts
in 3 banks.

1256
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:04,823
Apparently no entanglements,

1257
01:07:04,888 --> 01:07:06,318
either political or feminine.

1258
01:07:06,390 --> 01:07:07,860
Seems all right.
Why do you ask?

1259
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:08,964
She asked me about him.

1260
01:07:09,025 --> 01:07:10,065
Said some people in Halifax

1261
01:07:10,094 --> 01:07:11,304
told her to look him up.

1262
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:12,841
Personally, I don't
believe that anyone

1263
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:14,662
with as much money as Dan Morton

1264
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:16,511
would bother with the small
profit that treason pays,

1265
01:07:16,533 --> 01:07:18,903
and he's hardly the type
to go in for the excitement.

1266
01:07:18,968 --> 01:07:20,398
However, you never can tell.

1267
01:07:20,470 --> 01:07:23,110
And now I think you've
been here long enough, captain.

1268
01:07:24,141 --> 01:07:25,481
I'll check with you later.

1269
01:07:25,542 --> 01:07:28,412
You send a schedule over
to my hotel at 5:00.

1270
01:07:28,478 --> 01:07:29,808
Of course you'll phone me

1271
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:30,909
at the first suspicion

1272
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:31,920
that they're making use of it.

1273
01:07:31,981 --> 01:07:34,181
And, uh, your book, captain.

1274
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:35,421
Of course.

1275
01:07:38,522 --> 01:07:40,192
Thank you very much,
Mr. Smith.

1276
01:07:40,257 --> 01:07:41,457
Good day, sir.

1277
01:07:47,764 --> 01:07:50,174
I'm sorry to be late,
angel. I was held up.

1278
01:07:50,234 --> 01:07:51,544
I like waiting for you, Ricky.

1279
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:54,041
Wouldn't I make a splendid wife?

1280
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:55,244
What'll it be?

1281
01:07:55,305 --> 01:07:57,265
Something cool and long.

1282
01:07:57,341 --> 01:07:58,711
Something cool and long.

1283
01:07:58,775 --> 01:08:00,475
How about a couple
of planter's punches?

1284
01:08:00,544 --> 01:08:01,454
Fine.

1285
01:08:01,511 --> 01:08:02,511
Si, señor.

1286
01:08:04,248 --> 01:08:07,048
Rick, I had
the funniest feeling
coming over here.

1287
01:08:07,117 --> 01:08:09,047
I felt as though
I were being followed.

1288
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,419
A cab stayed right behind mine

1289
01:08:10,487 --> 01:08:12,287
all the way over from the hotel.

1290
01:08:12,356 --> 01:08:14,816
I may be imagining things,
but I don't think so.

1291
01:08:14,891 --> 01:08:16,731
Who do you think
would be following you?

1292
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:19,203
I wouldn't know.
Would you?

1293
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:21,633
All that funny business
on the boat.

1294
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:22,698
What did it mean, Rick?

1295
01:08:22,766 --> 01:08:26,866
Who is Dr. Lorenz,
and what is he up to?

1296
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:30,436
You're good, angel.
You're very, very good.

1297
01:08:30,507 --> 01:08:31,707
Don't you think it's about time

1298
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:33,411
we got together on a few things?

1299
01:08:33,477 --> 01:08:34,307
Such as?

1300
01:08:34,378 --> 01:08:36,048
Who we are and what we are.

1301
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:37,222
I've told you
everything about me.

1302
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,617
Now, look, angel,

1303
01:08:38,682 --> 01:08:40,292
we can play this dumb,
or we can play it smart.

1304
01:08:40,317 --> 01:08:41,917
I'm in this for what
I can get out of it,

1305
01:08:41,985 --> 01:08:43,625
and I don't think
I'm getting half enough,

1306
01:08:43,687 --> 01:08:45,407
and we can really make
Lorenz pay off plenty

1307
01:08:45,455 --> 01:08:46,715
if we throw in together.

1308
01:08:46,790 --> 01:08:47,830
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1309
01:08:47,857 --> 01:08:49,387
Come off it, angel.

1310
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:50,899
I don't know how you got
in with Lorenz's crowd,

1311
01:08:50,927 --> 01:08:53,097
but you're in it up
to your beautiful neck.

1312
01:08:53,163 --> 01:08:54,933
I didn't know Lorenz
had a crowd.

1313
01:08:54,998 --> 01:08:56,868
Oh, yes. I forgot.

1314
01:08:56,933 --> 01:08:58,973
You're the little lady
from medicine hat.

1315
01:08:59,035 --> 01:09:02,105
It was your twin sister
who was the buyer for
Rogers fifth Avenue.

1316
01:09:02,172 --> 01:09:04,212
Couldn't be that
she held that job

1317
01:09:04,274 --> 01:09:05,514
so that she could conveniently

1318
01:09:05,575 --> 01:09:07,105
take trips abroad, could it?

1319
01:09:07,177 --> 01:09:08,747
Let's see.

1320
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:10,812
How many did she make
2 years ago?

1321
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,420
3, wasn't it?

1322
01:09:12,482 --> 01:09:14,662
You must have gone
to a lot of trouble
to find out all this.

1323
01:09:14,684 --> 01:09:17,154
Sometimes it pays to go
to a lot of trouble.

1324
01:09:22,626 --> 01:09:24,256
Rick, I don't know
what you're thinking,

1325
01:09:24,328 --> 01:09:25,668
but whatever it is,
you're mistaken.

1326
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:29,095
Yes? In what way
am I mistaken?

1327
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,565
All right, Rick.
I'll tell you.

1328
01:09:30,634 --> 01:09:32,374
Well, well, well.
Look who's here--

1329
01:09:32,436 --> 01:09:33,366
the happiness kids.

1330
01:09:33,437 --> 01:09:34,697
Hello, Joe.
Hello, Joe.

1331
01:09:34,771 --> 01:09:37,241
Pull up a chair, Joe.
Thanks, I will.

1332
01:09:37,307 --> 01:09:39,047
What's that you're knocking
yourselves out with?

1333
01:09:39,075 --> 01:09:41,375
Hey, waiter! I'll have
one of those.

1334
01:09:41,445 --> 01:09:44,105
Well, how are we doing?

1335
01:09:44,180 --> 01:09:46,020
All right until this moment.

1336
01:09:46,082 --> 01:09:47,082
Waiter:
Miss Marlow?

1337
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:48,016
I'm miss Marlow.

1338
01:09:48,084 --> 01:09:49,254
A telephone call.

1339
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:50,949
That's funny.
Who could it be?

1340
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:53,790
It's easy enough to find out.

1341
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:55,287
This way, please.

1342
01:09:55,359 --> 01:09:57,229
You know what
I think I'll do, Rick?

1343
01:09:57,294 --> 01:09:58,544
I think I'll take
the train into Panama City,

1344
01:09:58,562 --> 01:09:59,962
and catch a coastline freighter.

1345
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:01,869
The next boat through here
is 3 or 4 days from now.

1346
01:10:01,898 --> 01:10:03,198
It's a Chinese boat,

1347
01:10:03,267 --> 01:10:05,167
and I'm not so keen
on taking a Chinese boat.

1348
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:07,095
So I figure I'll be saving
time in the long run

1349
01:10:07,170 --> 01:10:08,510
if I catch a coastline freighter

1350
01:10:08,572 --> 01:10:09,972
to Los Angeles or San Francisco

1351
01:10:10,039 --> 01:10:11,579
and make new connections there.

1352
01:10:11,641 --> 01:10:12,581
What do you figure on doing?

1353
01:10:12,642 --> 01:10:14,442
Me? I--I
don't know yet.

1354
01:10:14,511 --> 01:10:15,861
Why don't you string
along with me?

1355
01:10:15,879 --> 01:10:17,449
We could share a cabin.

1356
01:10:17,514 --> 01:10:19,224
That's not
a bad idea, except--

1357
01:10:19,283 --> 01:10:20,983
oh, I get it--
the little lady.

1358
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,890
Can't say that I blame you.
She sure is a swell dish.

1359
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:28,190
It's too bad about
the Genoa Maru

1360
01:10:28,258 --> 01:10:29,128
not being let through.

1361
01:10:29,192 --> 01:10:30,462
She wasn't a bad ship,

1362
01:10:30,527 --> 01:10:32,927
even though you did grab
the only dame on board.

1363
01:10:32,996 --> 01:10:34,296
I got to hand it to you, Rick.

1364
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:37,334
You sure are a fast worker,
if there ever was one.

1365
01:10:43,340 --> 01:10:45,140
Miss Marlow--
did she go?

1366
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:46,838
Si, señor.
Just now.

1367
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,550
The party that called--
any name?

1368
01:10:48,612 --> 01:10:49,482
No, señor.

1369
01:10:49,546 --> 01:10:51,476
Anything the matter?
No, not a thing.

1370
01:10:51,548 --> 01:10:53,148
Where did she go?

1371
01:10:53,216 --> 01:10:54,376
Oh, I get it.

1372
01:10:54,451 --> 01:10:56,351
Do me a favor.

1373
01:10:56,420 --> 01:10:57,760
If she comes back within
the next 10 minutes,

1374
01:10:57,787 --> 01:10:59,117
ask her to phone the hotel.

1375
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:00,418
Let me know where she'll be.

1376
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:01,530
You take care of the check.

1377
01:11:01,558 --> 01:11:03,358
Sure thing, Rick.

1378
01:11:06,330 --> 01:11:07,760
Mr. Leland.

1379
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:09,501
Has miss Marlow come back?

1380
01:11:09,566 --> 01:11:11,736
No. There's
something for you.

1381
01:11:11,801 --> 01:11:12,741
Dr. Lorenz?

1382
01:11:12,802 --> 01:11:13,972
Upstairs.

1383
01:11:14,037 --> 01:11:14,967
Any calls for him?

1384
01:11:15,038 --> 01:11:16,268
No call.

1385
01:11:16,340 --> 01:11:18,140
Hey, Sam. Give me
a passkey, will you?

1386
01:11:18,207 --> 01:11:20,677
Can do.

1387
01:11:20,744 --> 01:11:22,884
When she gets back,
ring twice, her room.

1388
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:23,946
Will do.

1389
01:12:22,772 --> 01:12:25,042
Sorry to disturb you,
Mr. Leland.

1390
01:12:25,108 --> 01:12:26,638
Oh, that's all right.

1391
01:12:26,710 --> 01:12:28,380
Has your search
revealed anything?

1392
01:12:28,445 --> 01:12:31,445
Yes.
You'd be surprised

1393
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:33,345
how little
girls wear these days.

1394
01:12:33,417 --> 01:12:34,717
I was shocked.

1395
01:12:34,784 --> 01:12:36,524
It's 5:05,
Mr. Leland.

1396
01:12:36,586 --> 01:12:38,986
I believe
you said 5:00.

1397
01:12:39,055 --> 01:12:40,985
You're a little fast.

1398
01:12:41,057 --> 01:12:43,287
But anyway.

1399
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,599
I would consider it
prudent of you,

1400
01:12:44,628 --> 01:12:45,788
Mr. Leland,
if you would cease

1401
01:12:45,829 --> 01:12:47,029
your attentions to miss Marlow.

1402
01:12:47,096 --> 01:12:48,256
Why so, doc?

1403
01:12:48,331 --> 01:12:49,531
Your interest in her

1404
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:52,039
is unqualifiedly
romantic, is it not?

1405
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:55,771
Between the two of us,
I'm nuts about the lady.

1406
01:12:55,839 --> 01:12:59,309
I suggest that you find
a safer romance,

1407
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,375
something more permanent.

1408
01:13:01,445 --> 01:13:04,705
And now, Mr. Leland,
the schedule.

1409
01:13:04,781 --> 01:13:05,651
Look, doc--

1410
01:13:05,715 --> 01:13:07,515
that is it in the envelope,

1411
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:08,624
isn't it,
Mr. Leland?

1412
01:13:08,685 --> 01:13:10,715
Oh, yes. That's it,
all right.

1413
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,418
1,500.

1414
01:13:13,490 --> 01:13:15,560
Now, hold on.
I know I said 1,500,

1415
01:13:15,625 --> 01:13:16,985
but it cost me that much.

1416
01:13:17,060 --> 01:13:18,460
Almost, anyways.

1417
01:13:18,528 --> 01:13:20,158
I'll only get
a few bucks out of it.

1418
01:13:20,229 --> 01:13:21,399
That's your business.

1419
01:13:21,465 --> 01:13:23,125
My business is
to take care of myself.

1420
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,199
How much more do you want?

1421
01:13:24,267 --> 01:13:25,497
Let's say 500.

1422
01:13:25,569 --> 01:13:26,669
Very well.

1423
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,536
But bear in mind,
Mr. Leland,

1424
01:13:28,605 --> 01:13:29,965
that such
extraordinary procedure

1425
01:13:30,039 --> 01:13:31,439
doesn't dispose me

1426
01:13:31,508 --> 01:13:33,138
towards further dealings
with you.

1427
01:13:33,209 --> 01:13:34,979
You got me all wrong, doc.

1428
01:13:35,044 --> 01:13:36,394
It isn't that I don't
want to play ball.

1429
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:37,652
I do, but for all I know,

1430
01:13:37,714 --> 01:13:39,824
you'll hand me the 1,500
and wave good-bye.

1431
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:41,183
I'll be left out in the cold

1432
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:42,350

how you got the plane
and torpedo parts

1599
01:27:36,952 --> 01:27:38,122
into the canal-zone area?

1600

Not at all--
piece by piece

and bit by bit.

1602
01:27:41,023 --> 01:27:42,123
We brought them in cases

of otherwise-innocent
farm equipment,

1604
01:27:43,926 --> 01:27:47,596
addressed to "D. Morton,
bountiful plantation."

1605
01:27:47,663 --> 01:27:48,463
D. Morton?

1606
01:27:48,531 --> 01:27:50,871
Mr. Marlow,
alias D. Morton.

1607
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:52,643
Her father.

1608
01:27:52,701 --> 01:27:54,741
Where do you figure in all this?

1609
01:27:54,803 --> 01:27:57,213
I don't, Rick.
I never did.

1610
01:27:57,272 --> 01:27:58,672
I told you that, remember?

1611
01:27:58,741 --> 01:28:00,541
I didn't know what
was going on down here.

1612
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:01,849
I felt that something was wrong.

1613
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:03,280
His letters were so strange.

1614
01:28:03,346 --> 01:28:04,906
I wrote him that
I would come down.

1615
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:07,280
He said that I shouldn't,
that I might be followed.

1616
01:28:07,350 --> 01:28:09,390
Then I got a telegram
to go to Halifax

1617
01:28:09,452 --> 01:28:11,252
and take the Genoa mar...

1618
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:12,600
I was going to tell you
this afternoon

1619
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:13,961
when I got the telephone call.

1620
01:28:14,022 --> 01:28:15,722
It was father.
He said to come quickly

1621
01:28:15,791 --> 01:28:18,161
and to make sure
that I wasn't followed.

1622
01:28:18,226 --> 01:28:20,056
That's why I left the way I did.

1623
01:28:21,464 --> 01:28:22,804
Nice timing, doc.

1624
01:28:22,865 --> 01:28:24,495
I take my hat off to you.

1625
01:28:24,567 --> 01:28:25,897
Thank you, sir.

Americans are famous
for good sportsmanship.

Tell me, captain,

1628
01:28:30,673 --> 01:28:32,173
would your attitude
remain the same--

1629
01:28:32,240 --> 01:28:33,580
impersonal, objective--

1630
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:36,512
were you to know that Smith,
Mr. a.V. Smith,

1631
01:28:36,579 --> 01:28:38,949
was unable to act
on your last words?

1632
01:28:39,014 --> 01:28:40,024
Stay put, Rick.

1633
01:28:40,082 --> 01:28:41,482
I see the knowledge
does affect you.

[Airplane engines starting]

1635
01:28:42,951 --> 01:28:44,551
It's nothing, captain.
Nothing at all.

1636
01:28:44,620 --> 01:28:45,990
They're only tuning up
the motors.

1637
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:48,194
We have a few minutes yet.

1638
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:50,456
You better sit down, Rick.

1639
01:28:54,262 --> 01:28:56,772
What do you want?

1640
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:59,102
I want--

1641
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:01,668
pathetic, is he not, sir?

1642
01:29:01,737 --> 01:29:04,467
There's a rugged individual.
Look at him!

1643
01:29:04,540 --> 01:29:08,110
Eyes without focus.
Flesh without feeling.

1644
01:29:08,176 --> 01:29:10,906
Lips with no tongue.
Utter decay.

1645
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:13,019
He stinks.

1646
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:14,321
Mr. Marlow is a thief--

1647
01:29:14,383 --> 01:29:16,693
a lazy, comfortable,
drunken thief.

1648
01:29:16,752 --> 01:29:18,552
He absconded with
his company's funds,

1649

escaped to Panama with his loot,

assumed another identity,
felt conscience-stricken.

1651
01:29:22,925 --> 01:29:25,385
Mr. Marlow's dipsomania
enabled us

1652
01:29:25,461 --> 01:29:27,901
to introduce our nationals
into his employ

1653

under the guise of workers
and servants.

1654
01:29:30,466 --> 01:29:32,436
In due time,
he became a prisoner on

1655

rather than the master
of this plantation.

from the emperor himself
