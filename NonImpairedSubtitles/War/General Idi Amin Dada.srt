1
00:00:28,728 --> 00:00:31,196
<i>Where the Nile rises on the equator...</i>

2
00:00:31,297 --> 00:00:33,629
<i>is the Africa of the great lakes.</i>

3
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:36,429
<i>Uganda is half the size of France.</i>

4
00:00:36,536 --> 00:00:39,835
<i>Her ten million inhabitants
have never known famine.</i>

5
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:43,102
<i>Her agricultural wealth,
her exports of coffee,</i>

6
00:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,144
<i>cotton, copper
and to developing industry...</i>

7
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:49,306
<i>allow her, for the most part,
to be less and less dependent...</i>

8
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,316
<i>on the outside world.</i>

9
00:00:51,418 --> 00:00:53,943
<i>It was shortly after
the independence...</i>

10
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,217
<i>of this former British colony
in 1962...</i>

11
00:00:57,323 --> 00:01:01,089
<i>that Lieutenant Idi Amin Dada
became interested in politics.</i>

12
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,526
<i>He rapidly became chief of staff...</i>

13
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:06,030
<i>and the right-hand man
of President Obote,</i>

14
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:10,296
<i>whom he overthrew in 1971
by a coup ïetat.</i>

15
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,133
<i>Obote was unpopular,</i>

16
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:15,503
<i>and his fall was welcomed
by the population.</i>

17
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:18,634
<i>He fled to Tanzania and
a reward was offered for him,</i>

18
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:21,270
<i>dead or alive.</i>

19
00:01:21,381 --> 00:01:25,147
<i>General Amin soon attracted attention
on the international scene...</i>

20
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:28,345
<i>with his numerous telegrams
to other heads of state.</i>

21
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:31,015
<i>He called Nixon
"my dear brother"...</i>

22
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:34,423
<i>and wished him a quick recovery
from the Watergate affair.</i>

23
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:38,156
<i>He congratulated the Chilean junta
when it took power.</i>

24
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,994
<i>He ordered the queen of England
to send the Scottish guard...</i>

25
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,467
<i>to accompany him
to the Commonwealth Conference.</i>

26
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:48,401
<i>Eighty-thousand Asians
installed by the British in Uganda...</i>

27
00:01:48,508 --> 00:01:50,908
<i>at the beginning of the century...</i>

28
00:01:51,010 --> 00:01:54,002
<i>controlled 80% of the country's economy.</i>

29
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,014
<i>In 1972, after a dream,</i>

30
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,051
<i>General Amin declared the economic war,</i>

31
00:01:59,152 --> 00:02:01,052
<i>which meant, on one hand,</i>

32
00:02:01,154 --> 00:02:03,179
<i>giving 90 days to the Asians
to leave the country,</i>

33
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,189
<i>taking with them the strict minimum,</i>

34
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:09,921
<i>and, on the other hand,
distributing their business to Ugandans.</i>

35
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:13,226
<i>Today, the economic war
has not yet been won.</i>

36
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:17,360
<i>Distribution chains and imports
have been disrupted.</i>

37
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,166
<i>The country's foreign reserves
are at their lowest.</i>

38
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:27,009
<i>In the capital,
it is almost impossible...</i>

39
00:02:27,113 --> 00:02:30,344
<i>to find sugar, flour,
imported industrial products,</i>

40
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,510
<i>spare parts or matches.</i>

41
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,589
<i>Uganda holds the record
for inflation in Africa.</i>

42
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:40,750
<i>In one year, prices have risen
from 20 to 50%.</i>

43
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:48,030
<i>On February 10th, 1972,</i>

44
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,763
<i>to set an example and to combat
budding guerilla warfare,</i>

45
00:02:51,871 --> 00:02:54,840
<i>General Amin organized
12 public executions...</i>

46
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,432
<i>at the same time
in the country's main towns.</i>

47
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:59,978
<i>Most observers agree...</i>

48
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:02,070
<i>that several thousand
Ugandans have disappeared...</i>

49
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:04,980
<i>since General Amin seized power.</i>

50
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,951
<i>Among the missing. '
The vice dean of the university,</i>

51
00:03:08,054 --> 00:03:12,582
<i>the president of the high court,
doctors and former ministers.</i>

52
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,962
<i>In 1973, the International
Commission ofjurists...</i>

53
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:24,400
<i>published a report denouncing
Uganda as a lawless country,</i>

54
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:27,667
<i>and it wrote about
the missing personalities. '</i>

55
00:03:27,774 --> 00:03:30,709
<i>"There is every reason to think
that they have been assassinated...</i>

56
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,007
<i>by members of the army
immediately after their arrest. "</i>

57
00:04:01,374 --> 00:04:05,902
The whole worlds
are looking at General Amin...

58
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,776
and at Uganda as a whole.

59
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:13,409
What will be the future
of Uganda?

60
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:16,682
The people are looking at this.

61
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:07,765
<i>I would like to speak as the heavyweight
champion here in Uganda.</i>

62
00:06:10,203 --> 00:06:12,103
Um...

63
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:17,666
I am sure I will be in position
even to defeat or defend myself.

64
00:06:17,777 --> 00:06:21,110
But I wanted to tell you this:
As a boxer,

65
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,947
also I am very happy to receive
this as a rugby player...

66
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,748
because I've been a member...

67
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:31,187
of the rugby team in Uganda.

68
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:34,384
And I used to play second row.

69
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:38,123
You know, pushing is very hard
and also wing three quarter.

70
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:42,895
You should know that
I used to run 9.8 second hundred yards.

71
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,699
This is...
With my speed, with my weight...

72
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,900
of, of getting the ball...

73
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:54,605
and when you tackle me,
you can harm yourself.

74
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:58,047
I think you should know this.
But I wanted to tell the boxers...

75
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:02,485
that the only chance
to defeat the referee...

76
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:05,614
who are against you...

77
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:09,661
or against the country,
is to win by knockout.

78
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,287
<i>This is the only thing.</i>

79
00:07:12,398 --> 00:07:14,832
And this is the most important.

80
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:19,462
<i>You must do everything possible...</i>

81
00:07:19,572 --> 00:07:21,802
<i>to win by knockout.</i>

82
00:07:21,908 --> 00:07:26,607
<i>You must knock anybody who is sparring
with you in the boxing ring.</i>

83
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:30,808
<i>This is my last. Thank you very much.</i>

84
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:54,765
<i>Fire!</i>

85
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:09,215
<i>- All the man in.
- Excellent.</i>

86
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,989
All in the heart.

87
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:15,559
Very good.

88
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,561
I come from very poor family.

89
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,569
I wanted to tell you this.

90
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:29,129
And when I became bigger,

91
00:08:29,242 --> 00:08:31,267
my father has no money.

92
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,777
I am to work,

93
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:38,442
digging, and then people
give me some money for food.

94
00:08:38,551 --> 00:08:42,851
And some money I keep it
and I pay my school fees.

95
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,753
And I study through hardship,

96
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:47,758
not just comfort.

97
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,920
And also I used to...

98
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:56,195
Then I was taken by force
into the army...

99
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,601
here in Kampala during the war.

100
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:03,106
And... I went there.
I did not want.

101
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:07,202
But later on, because of force,

102
00:09:07,313 --> 00:09:09,611
during the second World War,

103
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,706
I was taken to Burma.

104
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:15,844
And I work there until now.

105
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:19,152
I went through difficulty.

106
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,318
I go to the rank, from my rank,

107
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:26,057
from the rank of lance corporal...

108
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,827
up to general now... I became general.

109
00:10:02,401 --> 00:10:04,995
Your Excellence, guard all warmed up.

110
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:11,372
Formed up in two ranks,
ready for inspection, Your Excellence.

111
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:51,374
And if they found that what
you are saying, it is not truth,

112
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:55,045
then they will never listen
for you again.

113
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,146
And that, you will lose
confidence to the people.

114
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,248
But the people likes me very much.

115
00:11:00,359 --> 00:11:04,261
The reason why I am very popular
because I always speak to them truth.

116
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:08,629
And if I don't have anything
to tell them, I keep quiet.

117
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:23,948
We see the paratrooper school.

118
00:11:25,451 --> 00:11:28,045
<i>On March 10th, 1974,</i>

119
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,317
<i>the general announced,
"With the help of friendly countries,</i>

120
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,756
<i>"Uganda is going to arm
to the teeth to reach...</i>

121
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:35,827
<i>an international combat level. "</i>

122
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:02,852
As a paratrooper, they know exactly
to jump and be into sections.

123
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:13,893
<i>This song they do before they jump.</i>

124
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,229
<i>It warm them completely.</i>

125
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:25,700
I can't tell you, because
it is confidential in any country...

126
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:29,008
cannot tell you the strength
of the army.

127
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:38,315
Since I came in power,

128
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:41,018
automatically Uganda become
revolutionary...

129
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:43,857
not only the armed forces,

130
00:12:43,963 --> 00:12:47,729
but the whole police, prisons,
the whole public.

131
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:18,797
You see, lion...

132
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:23,426
Um, lion...
if you don't disturb lion,

133
00:13:23,536 --> 00:13:26,096
it can't do any harm.

134
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:29,504
And also I like very much elephants...

135
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:34,375
because it is a sign of liberty...

136
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,280
freedom and it moves freely.

137
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:42,377
It wants a big space.
This is the elephant.

138
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,389
And this is a sign
you can see in Africa.

139
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:49,587
There is plenty of land
where it can move freely.

140
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,859
It can eat completely
without being disturbed.

141
00:13:53,966 --> 00:13:56,833
And you find this only in Africa.

142
00:13:56,936 --> 00:14:01,964
And that is why you find
that the wild animal...

143
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:05,168
have got freedom mostly in Africa.

144
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:07,575
And, um...

145
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,912
And, uh, this is actually
what I am trying to do...

146
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:14,042
here in Africa.

147
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:16,951
The reason why I am very popular,

148
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:21,288
my policy all over Africa
and every African peoples...

149
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:26,057
wants freedom for their people.

150
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:29,862
They have requested me
to tell their leaders...

151
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,836
to give them this freedom...

152
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:37,307
and same policy as I did
here in Uganda.

153
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:40,401
<i>Because here I gave...</i>

154
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:43,879
<i>a completely full
economical independence...</i>

155
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,975
<i>to the people of Uganda.</i>

156
00:14:47,086 --> 00:14:48,986
<i>How many crocodiles here?</i>

157
00:14:49,088 --> 00:14:50,988
<i>Very many, yes.</i>

158
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:55,390
<i>And this is a very good area
of the crocodiles.</i>

159
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,554
<i>It is a headquarter
of the crocodile, you can see.</i>

160
00:14:58,664 --> 00:15:00,962
<i>You see as it is running very fast.</i>

161
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:06,530
<i>I think this might be captain
of crocodiles.</i>

162
00:15:08,507 --> 00:15:11,635
<i>Yes. He understand me now.
He's moving.</i>

163
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:17,382
<i>Very big. Yes.</i>

164
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:20,452
<i>Yes, very good. Yes.</i>

165
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:24,420
And we are now going, actually,
to the headquarters of crocodile,

166
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:29,017
where they lay more eggs...
they produce more children.

167
00:15:29,128 --> 00:15:32,529
We are going now.
And it is very attractive.

168
00:15:32,631 --> 00:15:37,000
And you can see here...
hundreds of crocodiles.

169
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:40,299
<i>Thousands of hippo, you see?</i>

170
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:54,944
<i>Guinea fowls,
in there at the edge. You see?</i>

171
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,954
<i>Guinea fowls.</i>

172
00:15:58,691 --> 00:16:01,319
<i>And this elephant is very big.</i>

173
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:03,327
<i>You see?</i>

174
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,920
And here it is a place
where you can found...

175
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:10,593
there is more crocodile
than anywhere in the world.

176
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,603
This place.

177
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,603
We say, "How are you?"

178
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,108
<i>Very good.</i>

179
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,377
He is eating.

180
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:34,425
He is greeting me also.

181
00:16:34,526 --> 00:16:37,552
And even this crocodile
is looking at us.

182
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:39,893
<i>Can I ask you to move?</i>

183
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:43,127
<i>Uh? Oh, we still want to watch it.</i>

184
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,580
<i>- You want me to ask it to move?
- Yes.</i>

185
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,719
Hey!

186
00:17:03,822 --> 00:17:05,847
You see, it open this...

187
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,984
so that the... ants...

188
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:12,086
can go into the mouth
and then it eats.

189
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:16,466
That's why it doesn't want
to be disturbed.

190
00:17:24,143 --> 00:17:26,043
He is sleeping.

191
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:38,655
<i>And most of them, they lay
their eggs under this places.</i>

192
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,657
Down there.

193
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:43,455
<i>You was telling us
that you think the Nile...</i>

194
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:47,396
<i>is a link between your country,
Sudan and Egypt.</i>

195
00:17:47,499 --> 00:17:52,334
<i>But for ages, it has been the problem
between the Arabs and the Africans.</i>

196
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:55,430
<i>The negros.
What do you think of that?</i>

197
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:59,875
Yes. It has been because
the leaders of Arabs...

198
00:17:59,978 --> 00:18:04,176
before, they were not
revolutionary leaders.

199
00:18:04,283 --> 00:18:06,376
But today,

200
00:18:06,485 --> 00:18:09,943
during my time
as a revolutionary leader,

201
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:13,354
I want to bring everybody...

202
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:17,452
in Africa and Arab worlds very closely,

203
00:18:17,563 --> 00:18:20,054
and Asia and Europe.

204
00:18:20,165 --> 00:18:23,430
And, therefore, we,
the revolutionary leaders,

205
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:27,232
we want to be friendly with all
peace-loving people in the world.

206
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:30,604
And this is highly appreciated
very much...

207
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:34,839
by most revolutionary leader in Arab.

208
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:38,110
That's why you find that, today,
there is more unity...

209
00:18:38,217 --> 00:18:41,186
between Africa and Arab than before,

210
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:44,949
especially during my tour
of Middle East.

211
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,048
I have toured very many countries,

212
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:49,389
and I have brought them together
as one family.

213
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:52,555
You see?
Elephant is dragged into water.

214
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:57,228
I think it can't get out.

215
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:03,001
<i>This is a very, very good
picture you can get.</i>

216
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,804
<i>This is the most beautiful part...</i>

217
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:09,972
in the continent of Africa.

218
00:19:10,082 --> 00:19:12,744
Used to be called Madison Falls.

219
00:19:12,851 --> 00:19:17,015
But it is now
Kabalega Falls National Park.

220
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:20,057
<i>That is the one.</i>

221
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,627
<i>And it is a tourist attraction.</i>

222
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,168
I came so close to the Arab...

223
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:36,230
because Arab found that I am
most influencing leader...

224
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,502
in Africa... in the continent.

225
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,545
And also I am a leader
who speaks the truth.

226
00:19:41,647 --> 00:19:44,115
<i>Did your Muslim religion take part...</i>

227
00:19:44,216 --> 00:19:46,980
<i>into your choice of the Arabs?</i>

228
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:50,782
It is not because of the Muslim...

229
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:53,858
because the people who broke
relationship with Israel...

230
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:57,019
they are not only Muslims,
they are Christians.

231
00:19:57,129 --> 00:20:01,463
But they have seen the truth.
And everybody listen for me.

232
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,196
And even in O.A.U.,
if I don't speak,

233
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,364
every leader try to ask why,
and I must speak.

234
00:20:08,473 --> 00:20:12,341
Like in a nonaligned conference
in Algeria...

235
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,538
I was not feeling well.
I did not speak.

236
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,445
But 15 minutes
before the conference closed,

237
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,882
<i>I was brought to come and give a speech.</i>

238
00:20:20,986 --> 00:20:22,886
<i>I gave very good speech,</i>

239
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:28,119
<i>including Castro broke relationship
with Israel after my speech.</i>

240
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:31,060
<i>Telegram sent to Mr. Kurt Waldheim,</i>

241
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:34,963
<i>permanent secretary
of the United Nations. '</i>

242
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:36,967
<i>"Hitler
and all the German people...</i>

243
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:41,938
<i>"knew that the Israelis are not people
who work in the interest of the world,</i>

244
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,498
<i>"and that is why they burnt
six millionjews alive with gas...</i>

245
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:47,738
<i>on the soil of Germany. "</i>

246
00:20:47,846 --> 00:20:51,714
<i>This telegram was sent the day
after the Munich killings.</i>

247
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:54,650
<i>Some years before,
General Amin had undergone,</i>

248
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:58,189
<i>as had other Ugandans,
paratroop training in Israel.</i>

249
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:01,088
But I'm trained
as a paratrooper in Israel.

250
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,286
But I have got a very good brain.

251
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:08,389
And even General Dayan knows
that I am very good field officer.

252
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,400
<i>You knew Dayan very well?</i>

253
00:21:10,502 --> 00:21:12,402
I know him and...

254
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,438
I know him.
He has been my friend.

255
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:17,440
He has been giving me dinner,
lunch in his house.

256
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:20,909
If I go to Israel,
I used to stay with Dayan.

257
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,914
He brings air force,
band playing for me.

258
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:28,646
We stay together.
But I must make absolutely truth.

259
00:21:28,754 --> 00:21:31,655
The reason why
I chased them from Uganda...

260
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:34,123
was because of the economy of Uganda.

261
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,456
Uganda was going to be bankrupt.

262
00:21:36,561 --> 00:21:39,587
That is the reason why
I chased away the Israelis.

263
00:21:39,698 --> 00:21:42,724
<i>- You were friends with Golda Meir?
- Yes.</i>

264
00:21:42,834 --> 00:21:47,328
<i>Because she used to give me
very good entertainment...</i>

265
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:49,339
<i>when I go to Israel.</i>

266
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:51,773
<i>Then you changed completely...</i>

267
00:21:51,877 --> 00:21:55,904
<i>from an Israeli alliance
to the Arab alliance.</i>

268
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:58,915
I changed from Israeli alliance...

269
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:02,418
because Israeli are criminals...

270
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:04,989
and they are not trusted people.

271
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,820
They don't tell the world the truth.

272
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:12,386
They were taken to Palestine
as refugees.

273
00:22:12,497 --> 00:22:15,898
And then they changed Palestine
to became the State of Israel...

274
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:17,992
by force of arms...

275
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:21,869
given to them by Americans
and the British.

276
00:22:21,973 --> 00:22:23,873
<i>But is it true that you said...</i>

277
00:22:23,975 --> 00:22:26,739
<i>Hitler didn't kill enough jews
during the war?</i>

278
00:22:34,419 --> 00:22:36,853
Why do you ask me about Hitler?

279
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:41,119
The Hitler's problem is now past tense.

280
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:43,126
Now we are looking forward...

281
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:47,255
for the future generations
and a future plan.

282
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,301
We are no longer going back to Hitler's.

283
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:52,336
You see, the war of Hitler...

284
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:55,565
it was a different war
than the war today.

285
00:22:55,674 --> 00:23:00,509
If I am to prepare the war
against Israel completely,

286
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:03,706
no, I don't want very many...

287
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:07,478
army, air force and navy...
just very few.

288
00:23:07,586 --> 00:23:11,249
And I strike inside Israel...

289
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:15,656
and move people from
the whole border towards Israel.

290
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,594
I think the situation
would be very difficult...

291
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:20,597
and very different.

292
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:24,157
<i>Strike from inside with paratrooper?</i>

293
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:26,965
With the paratrooper,
with everything, completely.

294
00:23:27,072 --> 00:23:29,939
Yes, because you got to
get there by paratrooper...

295
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,236
and also bombing by airplanes...

296
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,643
and having few squadron of suicide...

297
00:23:35,747 --> 00:23:37,806
these who are determined to be suicide.

298
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:41,044
And I think
that is already in progress...

299
00:23:41,153 --> 00:23:43,178
and they are practicing.

300
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:47,315
The suicide squadrons are
already in practicing progress.

301
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:51,419
I think very many delegations
meeting me now, preparing for this.

302
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,226
And they come to conclusion.
It is true.

303
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,493
You'll find it here.

304
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:59,729
<i>And this will change the type of battle.</i>

305
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:03,899
And we can command from here,
not from the battlefield,

306
00:24:04,009 --> 00:24:06,068
but through communication.

307
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:08,408
<i>And will there be Ugandans
in those battalions?</i>

308
00:24:08,513 --> 00:24:10,845
I don't know, but any volunteer.

309
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,349
Even France...

310
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,979
French volunteer...
they are welcome also.

311
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:20,990
But I welcome, I welcome
any volunteer all over the world.

312
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:24,892
Even Japanese, even Vietnamese...

313
00:24:24,996 --> 00:24:28,124
are there in these squadrons.

314
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:30,133
But they are now in training.

315
00:24:30,235 --> 00:24:32,863
They are undergoing training now
three months.

316
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,804
This is the pilot.

317
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,820
Then go to the Middle East
and visit the war...

318
00:24:52,924 --> 00:24:57,623
see how they are fighting
and encourage them to fight.

319
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,629
This was my decision.

320
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,466
And I enjoy it very much...

321
00:25:03,568 --> 00:25:09,302
having breakfast with
some Syrians and Iraqi...

322
00:25:09,407 --> 00:25:11,375
breakfast in the tanks.

323
00:25:11,476 --> 00:25:13,376
I was very happy.

324
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:17,938
<i>In October, while I was there,
I was visiting troops. I had my troops.</i>

325
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,949
<i>You had some soldiers up there?</i>

326
00:25:20,051 --> 00:25:22,451
<i>- I had the navy, yes.
- Navy?</i>

327
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,784
<i>- Yes. In Alexandria.
- Navy?</i>

328
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,916
<i>- But you don't have navy...
- We have trained.</i>

329
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:31,052
<i>- Ah, really?
- Yes.</i>

330
00:25:31,162 --> 00:25:35,997
<i>This is our secret weapon
in Lake Victoria.</i>

331
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:43,804
Marine. Frogmen I think is very good.

332
00:25:51,783 --> 00:25:53,683
Yes.

333
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:55,719
<i>In '67,you were on the Suez Canal?</i>

334
00:25:55,820 --> 00:26:00,519
Yes, yes. But you see, I am only one
who has been in both sides.

335
00:26:00,625 --> 00:26:05,494
During the '67 war,
I was in Suez Canal, on the other side.

336
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:10,364
And now I am in the Suez Canal
in the other side. I like very much.

337
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:14,971
First, the armored,

338
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,873
after crossing the Lake Galilee,

339
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:23,676
reaching the foot
of the Golan Heights,

340
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:28,378
they are engaged by the enemy...

341
00:26:28,486 --> 00:26:31,387
and the officer...

342
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:33,514
commanding mechanized battalion...

343
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:37,117
ask for the support...

344
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:40,322
by paratroopers and air support.

345
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,832
<i>You understand?</i>

346
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,834
I'm just explaining to you.

347
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,895
And while the armored...

348
00:26:49,007 --> 00:26:52,033
and the mechanized regiment
are being engaged,

349
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:54,270
the air force gave support...

350
00:26:54,379 --> 00:26:58,179
so that the paratrooper land
by helicopter...

351
00:26:58,283 --> 00:27:01,878
on the Golan Heights
and captured Golan Height.

352
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,847
<i>- We go because helicopter coming.
- Okay.</i>

353
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,156
You film. Film helicopter.

354
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:30,605
Right now the armored regiment...

355
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:34,406
they have been engaged
below the Golan Heights.

356
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:37,948
And the commander
of the mechanized regiment...

357
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,609
requested for the support.

358
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:44,314
And, therefore, the paratrooper
have been landing,

359
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:47,448
fighting to capture the objectives.

360
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:50,426
But air will come
and give them support.

361
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:53,964
They will be...
To capture completely the Golan Heights.

362
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,601
Another one is behind you.

363
00:29:06,711 --> 00:29:08,611
<i>Here, here, here.</i>

364
00:29:13,017 --> 00:29:16,145
<i>Left. Now advance.</i>

365
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:19,553
<i>- Advance!
- Advance!</i>

366
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,339
Here, here.

367
00:29:39,144 --> 00:29:43,171
<i>Victory over Golan Heights.</i>

368
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:13,235
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

369
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:28,613
The meeting is nonconfidential...

370
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,588
because I think that is why
you see here...

371
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,853
there is... the press people.

372
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:38,622
They are taping
and they wants to make a film...

373
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:40,721
about the cabinet.

374
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:44,962
But I have about seven points
which I think...

375
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:48,232
I should brief you completely...

376
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,364
and tell you to know...

377
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:54,206
exactly what is going on.

378
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:58,248
One is this:

379
00:31:58,349 --> 00:32:00,249
All of you,

380
00:32:00,351 --> 00:32:04,720
you are in very high-ranking
governmental positions.

381
00:32:06,057 --> 00:32:10,016
Your duty is not to be very weak.

382
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:13,461
You must not be like a woman...

383
00:32:13,564 --> 00:32:15,464
who is just weak,

384
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,592
and he can't speak, even talk.

385
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:24,198
You must be a person who...
to approach everybody as a minister.

386
00:32:24,309 --> 00:32:28,803
You want to know. You must be
concerned to know the problems...

387
00:32:28,913 --> 00:32:31,040
as a minister, as a governor,

388
00:32:31,149 --> 00:32:34,516
as any high-ranking
governmental officer.

389
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,814
This is the one point
which I must tell you.

390
00:32:36,921 --> 00:32:42,052
<i>You must be concerned
in planning ahead for your ministry.</i>

391
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:44,219
<i>Nobody is to plan for you,</i>

392
00:32:44,329 --> 00:32:47,992
<i>but it is you,
with your permanent secretary...</i>

393
00:32:48,099 --> 00:32:51,193
and the whole officer
under your command,

394
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:55,898
to plan for you,
for your minister, in advance.

395
00:32:56,007 --> 00:32:58,271
Not General Amin to tell you...

396
00:32:58,376 --> 00:33:02,836
that you go and plan this
and this for your ministry.

397
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:06,747
<i>You should not be like
a ministry of foreign affairs.</i>

398
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:11,413
I'm speaking not even now
when Otiang was there.

399
00:33:11,522 --> 00:33:14,423
Because some people
who are rotten...

400
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:18,325
they are there since Otiang
was there and also he's there.

401
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:22,889
These people are never been informed
since the former regimes.

402
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:27,870
What they know is to educate
people in common man's chatter only,

403
00:33:27,972 --> 00:33:31,669
but not proper educating people...

404
00:33:31,776 --> 00:33:34,074
of the worlïs
the policy of the government.

405
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:39,377
This I know direct from international
people whom I've been sending.

406
00:33:39,484 --> 00:33:43,682
They have been informing me that people
have not been educated outside...

407
00:33:43,788 --> 00:33:47,849
to know what actually
is happening here in Uganda.

408
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:51,417
And this is the ministry
of foreign affair.

409
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:55,431
This is the weakness
of the minister of foreign affair.

410
00:33:55,533 --> 00:33:56,727
<i>Two weeks later,</i>

411
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,893
<i>the body of Michael Ondoga,
Minister of Foreign Affairs,</i>

412
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,971
<i>was found in the Nile.</i>

413
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:04,603
<i>He was replaced by a former model,
Princess Bagaya,</i>

414
00:34:04,709 --> 00:34:06,677
<i>who holds a law degree
from Oxford.</i>

415
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,413
And everybody must be removed...

416
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:14,485
who have got the ideology...

417
00:34:14,585 --> 00:34:17,213
or the mentality...

418
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,221
of the capitalist...

419
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:21,689
who are no revolutionaries.

420
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,489
I've been informed
by the minister of foreign affair...

421
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:27,462
before even Ondoga came
that this is good,

422
00:34:27,565 --> 00:34:29,465
this is good, must remain there.

423
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:33,128
But I found they are rotten completely.

424
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,263
They are the one who have been
putting even "shameful,"

425
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,638
but while our position is very good.

426
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,644
We are not bankrupt
completely in Uganda.

427
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,180
We are very rich.

428
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:47,615
<i>I don't want somebody...
any minister...</i>

429
00:34:47,718 --> 00:34:49,948
<i>make me good report.</i>

430
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:52,488
<i>You must only tell me the truth.</i>

431
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:57,050
<i>This I've been telling you,
and now the truth is coming out.</i>

432
00:34:57,161 --> 00:35:01,791
<i>The false report you have been
reporting to me is now coming out.</i>

433
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:06,063
<i>Now I am going to second point.</i>

434
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:08,070
<i>As a minister,</i>

435
00:35:08,172 --> 00:35:12,165
<i>governor, high-ranking peoples...</i>

436
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:14,369
<i>and the people of the country,</i>

437
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,004
<i>they must love their leader.</i>

438
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,015
<i>This is the point number one.</i>

439
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:23,417
<i>If you go to any country,
you will find...</i>

440
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:27,480
<i>that everybody must love his leader.</i>

441
00:35:29,093 --> 00:35:31,857
They must love their ministers.

442
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:34,761
They must love their governors.

443
00:35:34,866 --> 00:35:37,562
They must love
their district commissioners,

444
00:35:37,668 --> 00:35:40,193
their teachers, their chiefs.

445
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,636
Everybody must be loved.

446
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:46,403
This...
It is an education to the people.

447
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,945
This is the duty of the minister.

448
00:35:54,685 --> 00:35:57,848
If I see the minister is a coward,

449
00:35:57,955 --> 00:36:02,358
automatically
I kick you out of my office...

450
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:05,759
because I know that you have got
something wrong with you.

451
00:36:05,863 --> 00:36:09,094
I will put some
another person straight...

452
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,532
or any governor or anybody.

453
00:36:11,636 --> 00:36:14,196
This I must make it absolutely clear.

454
00:36:14,305 --> 00:36:20,175
And even whether you hide, you
will be known in the light, completely.

455
00:36:20,278 --> 00:36:22,473
This I must make it absolutely clear.

456
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,812
Whether you hide, you go away,
you will be known, completely.

457
00:36:28,619 --> 00:36:31,884
But this particular second point
is very important.

458
00:36:31,989 --> 00:36:35,288
You must teach people
to love their leader.

459
00:36:35,393 --> 00:36:37,452
This is the only most important.

460
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,190
Like any country.

461
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:43,734
And the people also
must love their ministers.

462
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:48,396
But loving...
it is well known in Uganda.

463
00:36:48,506 --> 00:36:50,872
You can't change as a minister.

464
00:36:57,381 --> 00:37:00,714
Number three: Determinations.

465
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:05,152
You people must work
with determinations.

466
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:07,918
And all other peoples...

467
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:11,688
<i>you must teach them
to work with determinations.</i>

468
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,424
If I go sometime
even in the ministry of defense,

469
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:18,491
I will not find even
some commanders there in their offices.

470
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,731
I know this.
I been telephoning several time,

471
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:23,807
checking with them, I can't find.

472
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:28,470
They are in their business
in Kawempe, somewhere in Kampala, what.

473
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:30,479
<i>You must put your contribution.</i>

474
00:37:30,581 --> 00:37:36,417
If I find you not attend cabinet
three times without reason,

475
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,681
<i>you are out of government.</i>

476
00:39:01,672 --> 00:39:04,835
Now, chiefs... Number four.

477
00:39:04,942 --> 00:39:08,810
Chiefs and town agents.

478
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:13,213
The most important of the chiefs
and the town agents,

479
00:39:13,317 --> 00:39:15,877
if they are to work very hard,

480
00:39:15,986 --> 00:39:20,616
they will help the police, the prison,

481
00:39:20,725 --> 00:39:23,785
the air force, the army.

482
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,590
This include the military police.

483
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,461
They will help you, the ministers.

484
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:33,264
<i>They will not make even police
very busy...</i>

485
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:38,331
<i>because they know who is
actually good in the towns,</i>

486
00:39:38,442 --> 00:39:41,934
<i>who is not very good in the town.</i>

487
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:45,675
If you are to use these people
properly... even the police...

488
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:47,808
use these town agent properly...

489
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:50,352
They are being paid by the government.

490
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,945
They are not just working for nothing.

491
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:56,989
<i>And marketing here in Kampala...</i>

492
00:39:57,094 --> 00:40:02,327
<i>You must tell our womens in
Uganda to pull up their socks.</i>

493
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:06,426
<i>I want to see that Ugandans
work very hard.</i>

494
00:40:06,537 --> 00:40:11,907
You must not make the womens
of Uganda very weak.

495
00:40:12,009 --> 00:40:15,137
They must get up quickly in the morning.

496
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:18,238
<i>At about 5:00,
they are already in nakassero,</i>

497
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:22,877
preparing ready to sell
vegetable and everything in the shop.

498
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,888
If you go to Ghana,
if you go to Nigeria,

499
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:30,154
you will see that
the whole shops, market, everything.

500
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,525
Is Nigeria.
I think you agree with me.

501
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:36,691
Everybody agree.
Why not here in Uganda?

502
00:40:38,602 --> 00:40:41,662
You must tell our women I said...

503
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:47,267
that the duty of the woman
is the house woman.

504
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:50,609
He knows how to keep house very well.

505
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:54,673
If he can do that,
let me make first examinations,

506
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:59,586
appoint women to be the managers
of hotel, which is done.

507
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:03,888
Because this is a part
of the woman's job.

508
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:07,623
If they can keep house very well,

509
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:12,225
it is exactly like their duty
as a housewife.

510
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:16,531
If he's well-educated,
he has got that brain,

511
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,803
he is determined,
he can look after the hotel very well.

512
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:24,438
I want to see a woman
international hotel... very big one.

513
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:28,109
Must be woman Ugandans,
and I know they can do it.

514
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,882
And you as a minister,
you must back them completely.

515
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:36,892
If you find any man trying to not
to obey the order and everything,

516
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,894
you can punish that person.

517
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:40,896
You can remove that person.

518
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:45,332
You can put loyal people to her
to see that we keep up standard.

519
00:41:45,436 --> 00:41:49,668
I think we are the first
in our country, in Africa today,

520
00:41:49,773 --> 00:41:53,470
who have got many woman managers
than other countries.

521
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,912
We have got how many?

522
00:41:59,283 --> 00:42:02,047
<i>- Manager woman.
- Four.</i>

523
00:42:02,152 --> 00:42:04,450
We have got four manager,

524
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:08,491
<i>and we have got another two
assistant manager.</i>

525
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:11,425
<i>And another point here
I wanted to say.</i>

526
00:42:12,563 --> 00:42:17,899
<i>There is C.I.A. Agents
through Africa...</i>

527
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:21,665
<i>African, black Africans...
who are coming here.</i>

528
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:26,505
And you should know
that spy is criminal.

529
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,374
To be an spy is very bad.

530
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:34,611
And your case is death,
completely... sentence.

531
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,016
This I must make it absolutely clear.

532
00:42:37,121 --> 00:42:39,715
If I found anybody is a spy,

533
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:44,419
and any spy is found
and anybody he is coming in this cover...

534
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:48,624
See, I want you to see
that everybody must be checked...

535
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,326
his poll-tax...

536
00:42:51,435 --> 00:42:53,995
for about three or five years.

537
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,664
<i>And if he is found to be spy,</i>

538
00:42:56,774 --> 00:42:59,766
his case is firing squad.

539
00:42:59,877 --> 00:43:03,677
He must be handed
straight to military police,

540
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:06,306
must be dealt
with the military tribunal...

541
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:10,319
because the case of spying
is very serious.

542
00:43:11,722 --> 00:43:13,622
Anybody found is a spy,

543
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:18,218
his case must be dealt
with military tribunals.

544
00:43:18,329 --> 00:43:20,229
Once he is confirmed,

545
00:43:20,331 --> 00:43:23,164
even military tribunals
should not waste time...

546
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:26,862
of making law all day,

547
00:43:26,971 --> 00:43:30,031
discussing about one person
who is a spy.

548
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:32,040
Must be shortcut.

549
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,736
<i>If minister find him,</i>

550
00:43:35,846 --> 00:43:38,679
<i>don't even report it to me completely...</i>

551
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,580
<i>I don't want the ministers...</i>

552
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:45,985
<i>should wait anything which he thinks
it is good for his ministry.</i>

553
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:48,354
<i>He is still
waiting authority from me.</i>

554
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,451
I don't want.
Then if that, you are not minister.

555
00:43:51,562 --> 00:43:54,531
You are not making decisions.

556
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:58,932
A minister is a person who must
make a decision himself,

557
00:43:59,036 --> 00:44:01,004
not wait for General Amin.

558
00:44:02,539 --> 00:44:07,135
You can only inform me what you
are doing, what has happened.

559
00:44:07,244 --> 00:44:09,838
I feel very happy.

560
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:14,407
Because if I am to make a decision
all the time, I will be very annoyed.

561
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:17,783
<i>If you are not well-briefed,
come back to me.</i>

562
00:44:17,888 --> 00:44:22,825
<i>Telephone me at 5.'00
or midnight. You telephone me.</i>

563
00:44:22,926 --> 00:44:24,826
Some minister been telephoning me.

564
00:44:24,928 --> 00:44:26,828
I been answering them.

565
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:30,525
My telephone is simple.
If you telephone me at 2241,

566
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:32,727
whether at 3:00 in the morning,

567
00:44:32,836 --> 00:44:36,067
I get your telephone, I speak to you.

568
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:38,073
And if you want a briefing,

569
00:44:38,175 --> 00:44:41,838
I can brief you completely
until you understand.

570
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:43,845
And when you go there,

571
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,313
any reporters wants to ask you
about Uganda,

572
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:50,410
I think you are well-equipped
with all informations.

573
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,581
You can brief them.
You should not fear.

574
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:55,955
You should not say,
"No, it is not my duty. "

575
00:44:56,060 --> 00:44:58,858
If you are that,
you are not Ugandans.

576
00:44:58,962 --> 00:45:02,898
And if I am to get this,
you are not minister at all.

577
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:30,781
<i>As with many other scenes in this film,</i>

578
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:33,618
<i>the people's welcome
in a small garrison town...</i>

579
00:46:33,724 --> 00:46:36,249
<i>was specially-organized
for the film.</i>

580
00:48:13,857 --> 00:48:16,155
I am not completely communism,

581
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:19,787
and I am not capitalism because I...

582
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:24,061
Even very many leaders ask me
to join that part.

583
00:48:24,167 --> 00:48:26,067
That part I don't want.

584
00:48:26,169 --> 00:48:29,036
I am only leader
who is alone completely...

585
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:32,040
and following on only Uganda.

586
00:48:32,142 --> 00:48:34,042
And this is how we want.

587
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:37,443
We want just to be free
and also friendly...

588
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:39,981
to the capitalism people,

589
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:43,644
friendly to the socialism people.

590
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:46,348
But we are not going to adopt anything.

591
00:48:46,456 --> 00:48:51,519
But we only choose what
is the best from capitalism,

592
00:48:51,628 --> 00:48:55,530
from communism, we put in our,

593
00:48:55,632 --> 00:49:00,069
our policy of the country.

594
00:49:00,170 --> 00:49:02,070
And this is what we found better.

595
00:49:02,172 --> 00:49:04,072
We are not following
any policy at all.

596
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:08,291
<i>Seven, eight, two, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight!</i>

597
00:51:08,398 --> 00:51:11,925
<i>One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.</i>

598
00:51:28,385 --> 00:51:31,115
Very... Very new gun.

599
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:33,553
<i>- From guerillas.
- Guerillas?</i>

600
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:36,148
This captured when we were invaded.

601
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:39,854
<i>The general has already reviewed
these arms several times.</i>

602
00:51:39,963 --> 00:51:44,297
<i>They were captured during an attack
in the autumn of 1972 from Tanzania,</i>

603
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:46,665
<i>organized
by former President Obote...</i>

604
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:49,967
<i>- accompanied by a few hundred men.
- This submachine gun.</i>

605
00:51:50,073 --> 00:51:54,339
<i>Relations with Tanzania have been uneasy
since Amin seized power.</i>

606
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,469
<i>He dreamt of getting,
by force of arms,</i>

607
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,708
<i>an outlet to the sea
taken from Tanzania.</i>

608
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,146
Your Excellence,
all these were captured...

609
00:52:06,256 --> 00:52:10,249
by our chiefs as our troops
were being trained.

610
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:12,351
These are homemade.

611
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:16,762
So I think that's how you can
explain about that. Your Excellence.

612
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:21,668
<i>Telegram sent to Julius Nyerere,
President of Tanzania.</i>

613
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:24,239
<i>"I want to assure you
that I love you very much,</i>

614
00:52:24,341 --> 00:52:27,105
<i>"and if you had been a woman,
I would have considered marrying you,</i>

615
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:29,974
<i>"although your head
is full of grey hairs.</i>

616
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:34,039
<i>But, as you are a man,
that possibility does not arise. "</i>

617
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:37,712
<i>It was then that you sent
this telegram to Nyerere?</i>

618
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,721
<i>What was this?</i>

619
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:48,331
<i>- I think you read my telegram.
- Yes, what was it?</i>

620
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:51,195
<i>Was it to make fun of him?</i>

621
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:56,566
Because I love him very much. Yes.

622
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,801
<i>He did not reply me.</i>

623
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:01,810
<i>He kept quiet.</i>

624
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:37,402
I lead the country on my best way,

625
00:53:37,514 --> 00:53:40,108
how I want them to be lead...

626
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:42,242
according to my democracy,

627
00:53:42,352 --> 00:53:44,286
according to my knowledge...

628
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,685
and according to my thinking...

629
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:50,248
what is the best way of leading them.

630
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:53,557
And then I lead them
according to that way.

631
00:53:53,663 --> 00:53:57,360
<i>- There's direct contact between you
and the people? - Yes, and the people. Yes.</i>

632
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:59,628
No middle man.

633
00:54:31,101 --> 00:54:32,864
<i>I have 18 children.</i>

634
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:36,166
<i>Idi Amin
had four wives and has 18 children.</i>

635
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:40,937
<i>He has just repudiated three of his
wives for not being revolutionary enough.</i>

636
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,709
Ah, you see?
This one is very rough.

637
00:54:47,817 --> 00:54:50,980
<i>- Yes.
- How old, this one?</i>

638
00:54:51,087 --> 00:54:55,751
<i>- This one?
- Uh? This one and a half year old.</i>

639
00:54:55,859 --> 00:54:58,521
And this...

640
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:02,765
<i>- And Omonga.
- We have no preference.</i>

641
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:06,962
This has been to Paris.
He has been to Soviet Union.

642
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:10,403
And this is still not yet
in school, and this and that.

643
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:18,909
<i>It's difficult to educate 18 children?</i>

644
00:55:19,015 --> 00:55:21,916
<i>- Not very difficult.
- Not difficult?</i>

645
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,205
<i>I have 12 boys...</i>

646
00:55:49,312 --> 00:55:51,576
and six girls.

647
00:55:53,683 --> 00:55:56,675
This the one girl and six boys.

648
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:01,791
I am very good marksman.

649
00:56:06,563 --> 00:56:10,795
But I like children very much.
Yes, they are very happy.

650
00:56:18,174 --> 00:56:22,201
<i>- That's very good.
- Maybe we could sit down there.</i>

651
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:25,679
With you?

652
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,887
But you can't see the sun proper.

653
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:38,950
<i>- You want interview me? Yes.
- Yes.</i>

654
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,998
<i>Every evening,
there is a news broadcast...</i>

655
00:56:43,099 --> 00:56:45,033
<i>in four languages on television.</i>

656
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:48,161
<i>The slightest event concerning
the president is reported.</i>

657
00:56:57,547 --> 00:57:00,607
<i>During a press conference with French
journalists held at the Entebbe Palace,</i>

658
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:03,379
<i>His Excellency President Amin
announced that he was in possession...</i>

659
00:57:03,486 --> 00:57:06,614
<i>of a manual detailing
all of the Israeli plans.</i>

660
00:57:10,126 --> 00:57:14,119
Mecca and Medina should be today...

661
00:57:14,230 --> 00:57:16,664
under the control of the Israelis.

662
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:21,135
But because they lost the war
in first five days,

663
00:57:21,237 --> 00:57:23,933
they couldn't continue even further.

664
00:57:24,040 --> 00:57:25,940
And that is why it stopped.

665
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:28,943
But their aim
is to capture Mecca and Medina.

666
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:32,014
All the holy places
all over the world...

667
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:35,084
should be controlled by the Israelis.

668
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:39,144
This is their aim.
I have got these books with me.

669
00:57:39,255 --> 00:57:43,021
And I am sure, after we finish here,

670
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,026
I will give you the copy of the book.

671
00:57:45,128 --> 00:57:47,688
But you reading my copy today, here,

672
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,697
and you give it back to me...

673
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:54,099
because, if Israeli find it,
they will buy the whole copy.

674
00:57:54,204 --> 00:57:57,605
And they don't want the people
in the world to see this book.

675
00:57:57,707 --> 00:58:00,141
I will give you. It is here.

676
00:58:00,243 --> 00:58:02,677
<i>Uh, it is a book of the Israelis...</i>

677
00:58:02,779 --> 00:58:08,445
<i>which is the teaching of the elders
of the Israelis... of the Zionists.</i>

678
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:10,451
<i>The book is a fake,</i>

679
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:13,488
<i>published in 1901
by the Russian secret police.</i>

680
00:58:13,590 --> 00:58:15,490
<i>Millions of copies were printed.</i>

681
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:18,527
<i>It was required reading in
the schools of the Third Reich.</i>

682
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:24,058
<i>When asked if it was true that
the Israelis wanted to poison the Nile,</i>

683
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,067
<i>General Amin replied that
they had indeed wanted...</i>

684
00:58:26,169 --> 00:58:28,296
<i>to do so while they were still
in Uganda.</i>

685
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:37,369
They can poison the water...
River Nile... from Uganda...

686
00:58:37,480 --> 00:58:40,972
so that the people who will be drinking
in the other end, they will die.

687
00:58:41,084 --> 00:58:43,518
<i>General Amin remarked that
the plans of the Israelis...</i>

688
00:58:43,620 --> 00:58:46,214
<i>were even more disgusting
than Hitler's against thejews.</i>

689
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:54,594
Dreaming...
it has been the true on my side.

690
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:57,427
Because some people dream
which is not the truth.

691
00:58:57,534 --> 00:58:59,502
But I dream the truth.

692
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:02,571
I dream, when I was still...

693
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:05,505
just none, nothing, completely,

694
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:07,508
I will be the army commander.

695
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:11,137
I am commander of the highest man...

696
00:59:11,247 --> 00:59:13,647
commander in chief of the armed forces.

697
00:59:13,750 --> 00:59:16,776
I dream I will be the head of state...

698
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:21,186
and the most highest
head of state in the world...

699
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:25,091
when I was just none...
and it became truth.

700
00:59:25,194 --> 00:59:28,595
I dream completely in Karamonja,

701
00:59:28,698 --> 00:59:31,895
in August the fourth,

702
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:34,936
at about 5:00 in the morning,

703
00:59:35,038 --> 00:59:39,372
that, if you take decision now...

704
00:59:39,475 --> 00:59:44,105
and remove the whole noncitizens...

705
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:47,614
who are being milking
the economy of Uganda,

706
00:59:47,717 --> 00:59:50,948
this is the only chance Uganda will get.

707
00:59:51,054 --> 00:59:53,022
You must take immediate actions.

708
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:56,319
I left the place without breakfast,

709
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:59,122
and I went and declare economic war.

710
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,128
And it is true.

711
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,596
Today, the people
in Uganda are enjoying.

712
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:07,033
This is the truth. I dream about,

713
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:10,299
before end of 1975,

714
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:15,373
Arabs will win the war.

715
01:00:15,478 --> 01:00:19,039
<i>I think I read did you dream
people were trying to kill you?</i>

716
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:22,140
I dream, but it was impossible.
They couldn't do it.

717
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:26,950
Because I know exactly...
I dream that in...

718
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:32,221
I know exactly when, how,
what time I am going to die.

719
01:00:32,328 --> 01:00:36,025
This I know.
And which year and which date.

720
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:38,760
All this I know already,
and it is a secret.

721
01:00:38,868 --> 01:00:41,268
I have said this clear.

722
01:00:41,371 --> 01:00:45,171
Yes, I know. That is why
you find me, I am not a coward...

723
01:00:45,274 --> 01:00:48,732
because I know exactly
how I am going to die,

724
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:51,541
following all
what has been happening.

725
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:54,947
And I know exactly.
And I can know, sometime,

726
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:59,647
what will happen
in the country or to me...

727
01:00:59,756 --> 01:01:02,850
in the next few hours or few days.

728
01:01:02,959 --> 01:01:05,689
I know this exactly.

729
01:01:05,795 --> 01:01:09,788
And I know exactly that
who will be making something...

730
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:12,129
against me very soon.

731
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:14,533
I can notice him straight.

732
01:01:14,637 --> 01:01:17,606
And he can get punishment
from God straight.

733
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:22,735
Because I work only according
to the Goïs instruction.

734
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:26,872
And I know exactly that
who will be making something...

735
01:01:26,983 --> 01:01:29,417
against me very soon.

736
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,919
I can notice him straight.

737
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:34,922
And he can get punishment
from God straight.

738
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:40,223
Because I work only according
to the Goïs instruction.

739
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:42,229
It is voice of God,

740
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:44,231
and it is not me just speaking,

741
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,530
but it is the truth
and it is meaningful.

742
01:01:47,637 --> 01:01:50,606
And if you are to follow de Gaulle,

743
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,505
he was a very great leader.

744
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:56,772
Napoleon... very great leader.

745
01:01:56,879 --> 01:02:00,042
Mao Tse-tung is very great leader.

746
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:03,516
And... this leader whom I'm saying...

747
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:06,087
<i>- Very great. Who is another you said?
- Qaddafi?</i>

748
01:02:06,189 --> 01:02:08,316
Qaddafi is very popular,

749
01:02:08,424 --> 01:02:13,054
whether the people in the Arab
worlds in some way against him.

750
01:02:13,162 --> 01:02:15,494
It is impossible, like me.

751
01:02:15,598 --> 01:02:17,532
Here it is impossible.

752
01:02:17,633 --> 01:02:22,400
We already put foundation
stone of our...

753
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:25,440
how strong we are in the worlds.

754
01:02:25,541 --> 01:02:27,441
And the people understand.

755
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,443
And even I am still fighting...

756
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:34,141
for the whole black people
all over the worlds...

757
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,411
in Caribbeans,

758
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:39,750
in Negro Americans,
all over the world,

759
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:42,347
which I am still fighting for them.

760
01:02:42,458 --> 01:02:45,723
And they respect me very much
and very highly.

761
01:02:45,828 --> 01:02:50,925
And they were taken to America
as slaves... those people.

762
01:02:51,033 --> 01:02:53,831
They did not want to go there.

763
01:02:53,936 --> 01:02:57,804
And this is their country,
but they were taken by force.

764
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:00,102
Therefore, nobody should
remove them from there.

765
01:03:00,209 --> 01:03:02,939
They must get independent in America,

766
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:05,570
and they must control the Americans.

767
01:03:05,681 --> 01:03:09,117
The black people in America...

768
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:12,881
must be the president of
the United States of America...

769
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:16,015
must be the secretary of state,
like Kissinger.

770
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,559
They are more brilliant...

771
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:21,027
than the Dr. Kissinger.

772
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,291
Kissinger is not very intelligent.

773
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:26,493
Kissinger always go
to the weakest leaders.

774
01:03:26,602 --> 01:03:30,003
He never go to Qaddafi.
He never come to General Amin.

775
01:03:30,106 --> 01:03:32,404
He fears us. You see?

776
01:03:32,508 --> 01:03:34,408
This is what Kissinger is going.

777
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:36,842
He goes only
to the weakest leaders.

778
01:03:36,946 --> 01:03:42,077
Because he know there is
the strongest leaders in Uganda.

779
01:03:42,185 --> 01:03:44,676
And he will never go to Uganda.

780
01:03:44,787 --> 01:03:47,051
<i>- They are afraid of you?
- Yes.</i>

781
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:50,853
Because I speak the truth,
and I know their mistake.

782
01:03:52,461 --> 01:03:54,361
I know their mistake,

783
01:03:54,463 --> 01:03:57,398
and I know how to teach
the America their mistake.

784
01:03:57,500 --> 01:03:59,627
<i>On speaking of the Americans,
the general said...</i>

785
01:03:59,735 --> 01:04:01,965
<i>that he had in his possession
certain equipment they used...</i>

786
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:04,471
<i>to spy on the Russian
and Chinese embassies.</i>

787
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:14,576
<i>He noted that President Nixon
wanted to export Watergate to Uganda.</i>

788
01:04:14,684 --> 01:04:19,519
And you see, this is the mistake
of Nixon... of Watergate.

789
01:04:19,622 --> 01:04:21,852
He was bringing in Uganda,

790
01:04:21,958 --> 01:04:24,620
taping all embassies...

791
01:04:24,727 --> 01:04:28,128
Chinese embassies, Russian embassies.

792
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:30,995
All this problem was brought by...

793
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:33,193
<i>And thas why they left...</i>

794
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:35,668
<i>because they got afraid
when you discovered the thing?</i>

795
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:37,671
That is why they run away from me.

796
01:04:37,773 --> 01:04:42,107
And I say that how can 250 million...

797
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:44,907
run away from only General Amin?

798
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:47,881
That I am very powerful than Americans.

799
01:04:47,984 --> 01:04:51,545
I have no Phantoms.

800
01:04:54,223 --> 01:04:57,283
<i>- But you have MIGs.
- Hmm?</i>

801
01:04:57,393 --> 01:04:59,861
I have a brain.

802
01:04:59,962 --> 01:05:04,661
Because I discover
their mistake in advance.

803
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:08,931
Because my brain work
in advance than them.

804
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:12,666
When I come out,
we have to capture this port.

805
01:05:12,775 --> 01:05:16,939
Eh? Everyone must reach this port.

806
01:05:17,046 --> 01:05:20,504
<i>- We are diving.
- I am not diving.</i>

807
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:22,948
<i>- just a jump.
- If you dive down, we cut you.</i>

808
01:05:23,052 --> 01:05:26,283
You must jump here
and then start this straight.

809
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,686
Ready? You do now.
You give us green light.

810
01:05:33,796 --> 01:05:37,960
<i>Give us the time too. Ready? Go.</i>

811
01:05:49,145 --> 01:05:51,773
Very good.

812
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:07,394
I won.

813
01:06:35,891 --> 01:06:39,793
I have seen the whole African...
how they suffered,

814
01:06:39,895 --> 01:06:41,795
including my father and everybody.

815
01:06:41,897 --> 01:06:45,162
<i>- I know this very well.
- Can you tell a story?</i>

816
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,792
<i>- Hmm?
- Can you tell a story with that?</i>

817
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:50,804
<i>- I will just give you simple.
- An example.</i>

818
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:54,637
People used to carry British
on their heads.

819
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:59,306
British used to send...
They make something like a stretcher...

820
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:01,315
and put chair on top.

821
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:06,480
And then they used to carry
British for miles and miles.

822
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:08,819
This is African carry.

823
01:07:08,924 --> 01:07:12,655
And they used to dig holes
and everything.

824
01:07:12,762 --> 01:07:15,492
They used to carry
when the British was here.

825
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:18,624
And the Africans,
when they make a mistake,

826
01:07:18,734 --> 01:07:21,066
they used to be beaten by canes,

827
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,070
completely, by the British.

828
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:25,504
<i>You should like to see Mr. Heath?</i>

829
01:07:25,608 --> 01:07:30,238
I would be... I will never talk
to anybody from Britain...

830
01:07:30,346 --> 01:07:34,282
if Mr. Heath himself
does not come to me here.

831
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,283
Yes, here in Uganda,

832
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,479
because I declared economic war
here in Uganda.

833
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:43,820
And I will see him
in command post. Not anybody.

834
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:47,760
If Mr. Heath does not come,
then it is not my problem.

835
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:51,629
It is up to him.
It is up to him now to beg me.

836
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,895
If he doesn't beg me, it is up to him.

837
01:07:54,003 --> 01:07:57,200
Because I am the one
who has got the money.

838
01:07:57,306 --> 01:07:59,467
I am not going to borrow money from him.

839
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:02,976
Even I don't want, I am getting
millions of shillings.

840
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:06,810
Uganda is getting
from selling their crops...

841
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:09,646
and everything every years.

842
01:08:09,752 --> 01:08:14,280
British now, actually...
They are in chaos, as you know.

843
01:08:14,390 --> 01:08:17,359
Their economic is in chaos, completely.

844
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:21,260
I think if I am really British,
I could run to France...

845
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:26,027
and ask the financial
and assistant in France.

846
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,399
It is just your neighbor there.

847
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:32,838
You should help them.
Like, I am very far away from London.

848
01:08:32,942 --> 01:08:35,342
<i>But I am helping them. I am collecting.</i>

849
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:39,972
<i>I am appealing for everybody
in the world to assist the British.</i>

850
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:43,984
We made a collect
of over 43,000 shilling.

851
01:08:44,086 --> 01:08:47,078
<i>And what Mr. Heath said?</i>

852
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:50,215
<i>- Mr. Heath?
- About this collect.</i>

853
01:08:50,326 --> 01:08:52,453
Uh, he said...

854
01:08:52,561 --> 01:08:55,223
He hasn't replied me yet.

855
01:08:55,331 --> 01:08:57,231
<i>- He hasn't?
- Yes.</i>

856
01:08:57,333 --> 01:09:00,131
I am very annoyed.
I am waiting for his reply so that...

857
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:03,103
I have requested him for airplane...

858
01:09:03,205 --> 01:09:05,105
so that I can send the food.

859
01:09:05,207 --> 01:09:09,871
Because some people donated
food lorry of vegetable.

860
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:14,541
Three tons to be given
to the friends in Britain.

861
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,845
But he hasn't send airplane yet.

862
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:19,546
<i>But maybe it will be deteriorated?</i>

863
01:09:19,655 --> 01:09:21,782
I don't know. It is up to him...

864
01:09:21,891 --> 01:09:27,295
because I had sent on the very
day they donated the food.

865
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:30,923
<i>I have very many friends in Britain.</i>

866
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:33,968
It is only the problem
I had to put to them.

867
01:09:34,069 --> 01:09:37,505
That is why they have more problem.

868
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,972
You see there? I'm trying to help.

869
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:43,306
<i>Even myself,
I donated 10,000 shilling...</i>

870
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:48,475
<i>from my own saving
to Save the British Fund.</i>

871
01:09:48,584 --> 01:09:52,918
<i>We have opened the fund here...
Save the British Fund.</i>

872
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,922
<i>Yes.</i>

873
01:09:55,157 --> 01:09:58,991
I wanted to... make...

874
01:09:59,094 --> 01:10:02,461
special language
in black America of African...

875
01:10:02,565 --> 01:10:06,126
because I wanted to...

876
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:09,636
brainwash them
from British colonials.

877
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:14,038
And I wanted to make them
understand one language in America.

878
01:10:14,143 --> 01:10:16,373
I might introduce Swahili...

879
01:10:16,478 --> 01:10:18,378
to all black American...

880
01:10:18,480 --> 01:10:21,278
to understand this language in America.

881
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:24,511
<i>You laid the stone of a foundation...</i>

882
01:10:24,620 --> 01:10:27,145
<i>of a new broadcasting station.</i>

883
01:10:27,256 --> 01:10:29,156
<i>Which country will it cover?</i>

884
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:31,249
<i>It will cover including France.</i>

885
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,090
Including everybody,
I think, in Europe,

886
01:10:34,196 --> 01:10:37,529
in America, in Soviet Union,
China, everywhere.

887
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:39,999
It will cover...
So that in all Africa...

888
01:10:40,102 --> 01:10:42,502
people will listen
for radio broadcast...

889
01:10:42,605 --> 01:10:45,199
from Uganda, direct.

890
01:10:45,307 --> 01:10:47,207
This is very important.

891
01:10:47,309 --> 01:10:49,209
<i>Will you speak in English or...</i>

892
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:54,681
No, it is going to be Swahili,
English, French, Arabic.

893
01:10:54,783 --> 01:10:57,616
This is four official language
will be spoken.

894
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:02,316
<i>English, French, Arabic and Swahili.</i>

895
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:22,871
<i>Would you accept
some Palestinian hijackers...</i>

896
01:11:22,978 --> 01:11:25,446
<i>with their hostages in Uganda?</i>

897
01:11:25,547 --> 01:11:28,209
<i>- The Palestinians?
- Yes, I read in the papers...</i>

898
01:11:28,317 --> 01:11:30,979
<i>they were asking to be sent
to Uganda or to Libya.</i>

899
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:33,953
If they are sent here,
I would welcome them.

900
01:11:37,126 --> 01:11:41,324
Because we believe in peace.

901
01:11:41,430 --> 01:11:43,864
And that is why
in the United Nations...

902
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:47,265
they have already passed...

903
01:11:47,369 --> 01:11:50,099
one of the agenda...

904
01:11:50,205 --> 01:11:54,198
that the Black September
should be treated...

905
01:11:54,310 --> 01:11:57,802
as prisoner of war,
but not as the criminal...

906
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:00,882
because they are fighting
for their cause.

907
01:12:00,983 --> 01:12:03,816
<i>So you will put them in prison
if they come here?</i>

908
01:12:03,919 --> 01:12:07,184
I don't know whether
I will put them in prison,

909
01:12:07,289 --> 01:12:09,849
but I know how I will keep them.

910
01:12:09,958 --> 01:12:12,449
But they are welcome.

911
01:12:12,561 --> 01:12:15,291
<i>- In Uganda?
- Yes.</i>

912
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:19,595
If they want to come to Uganda,
they are welcomed in Uganda.

913
01:12:19,702 --> 01:12:21,863
They have got representative.

914
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:23,904
<i>Having expelled the Israelis,</i>

915
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:26,031
<i>General Amin installed
the Palestinians...</i>

916
01:12:26,141 --> 01:12:28,200
<i>in the former Israeli embassy.</i>

917
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:33,748
<i>But the people
in some planes are innocent.</i>

918
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:35,749
But you must not go in the airplane...

919
01:12:35,851 --> 01:12:38,786
which is belonging to Israelis,

920
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:41,185
to Portuguese, to South Africa.

921
01:12:41,290 --> 01:12:44,282
If you use these airplane,
then it is up to you.

922
01:12:44,393 --> 01:12:48,329
You must choose because the airplane
is booked in advance.

923
01:12:48,430 --> 01:12:50,398
You must know this.

924
01:12:50,499 --> 01:12:52,990
It is not
Black September's mistake.

925
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:55,730
It is the people's mistake...

926
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:59,774
because they are the one who choose
what airplane they should fly in.

927
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:03,242
You must fly in Air France.

928
01:13:03,345 --> 01:13:05,643
You must fly in East African Airway.

929
01:13:05,748 --> 01:13:08,740
This is very good.

930
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:36,770
<i>Faced with fines or imprisonment,</i>

931
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:38,847
<i>the naked tribesmen of Karamonja...</i>

932
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:40,847
<i>are forced to wear clothes.</i>

933
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:46,385
<i>Women are forbidden to wear wigs,</i>

934
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:49,457
<i>trousers or miniskirts.</i>

935
01:13:49,558 --> 01:13:51,856
<i>General Amin has planned
to group together...</i>

936
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:55,862
<i>the idle and unemployed and
make them work in cooperatives.</i>

937
01:14:07,843 --> 01:14:12,246
You can actually educate people
through traditional dance...

938
01:14:14,349 --> 01:14:17,682
how to make very good garden like this.

939
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:20,277
It will be in the song.

940
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:22,687
When you are singing,
people are watching.

941
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:28,093
You talk about the flower. You must
make very good garden in your house.

942
01:14:28,197 --> 01:14:31,724
You must have house with big latrines.

943
01:14:31,834 --> 01:14:34,462
Make it clean. People will understand.

944
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:37,130
"Oh, this song has got meaning.

945
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:39,230
I must go and make this. "

946
01:14:39,341 --> 01:14:44,074
And you must boil the water
before you drink...

947
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:46,909
because you might have disease
in the stomach.

948
01:14:47,015 --> 01:14:49,882
You are helping doctor.
You understand?

949
01:14:49,985 --> 01:14:54,445
You must work hard.
You must produce more foods...

950
01:14:54,556 --> 01:14:57,753
for export, for selling
to get more money...

951
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:03,662
and for your self reserve
in case of dry season.

952
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:05,995
Hot sun.

953
01:15:06,101 --> 01:15:09,696
You will have a reserve food
in your store.

954
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:11,705
You will not die from hunger.

955
01:16:53,275 --> 01:16:55,539
You are all right
for your communication?

956
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:57,612
Yes, sir.

957
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:07,679
That's very good.

958
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:18,387
As a pilot, you must know...

959
01:18:18,493 --> 01:18:23,226
your all techniques within the aircraft.

960
01:18:23,331 --> 01:18:27,427
You must know map reading
very well, completely.

961
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:30,528
<i>You must be ready to go and fight...</i>

962
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:32,539
<i>in any part of Africa...</i>

963
01:18:32,641 --> 01:18:35,974
<i>which is still under
imperialist domination...</i>

964
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:37,978
<i>if you have been directed to go...</i>

965
01:18:38,080 --> 01:18:41,948
with other forces
of the O.A.U. Members.

966
01:18:42,050 --> 01:18:43,950
This is the one of the things.

967
01:18:44,052 --> 01:18:47,818
But you are still to go
for another intensive training.

968
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:51,359
You are to go for another...

969
01:18:51,460 --> 01:18:54,190
fastest airplane than this one.

970
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:56,196
You are to go.

971
01:18:56,298 --> 01:19:00,359
<i>Only one pilot,
if he is to do his duty properly,</i>

972
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:04,599
<i>he can really make a big destructions.</i>

973
01:19:04,706 --> 01:19:08,802
And also, as a pilot,
when you are going to fight,

974
01:19:08,910 --> 01:19:10,810
you must not think...

975
01:19:10,912 --> 01:19:13,881
that you are going back to the base.

976
01:19:13,982 --> 01:19:17,645
<i>But you must fly while knowing...</i>

977
01:19:17,753 --> 01:19:21,712
<i>that you are going
to complete your mission.</i>

978
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:25,759
<i>But if, God bless you,
you go back... back to the base.</i>

979
01:20:31,693 --> 01:20:33,627
<i>Amin gets ready to face...</i>

980
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:37,164
<i>a much more critical audience
than his usual audiences.</i>

981
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:40,792
<i>It is a gathering of the capital's
eminent physicians.</i>

982
01:20:41,903 --> 01:20:45,236
<i>Indulge a private practice...</i>

983
01:20:45,340 --> 01:20:48,673
<i>and to fight the economic war.</i>

984
01:20:48,777 --> 01:20:52,440
<i>There has been growing concern
in the public...</i>

985
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:56,313
<i>about some doctors
who have located surgeries...</i>

986
01:20:56,418 --> 01:21:00,115
<i>and others who have located
private businesses...</i>

987
01:21:00,222 --> 01:21:04,181
<i>have been spending most
or a lot of their time...</i>

988
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:06,283
<i>and much of their attention...</i>

989
01:21:06,394 --> 01:21:08,692
<i>was increasingly being drawn...</i>

990
01:21:08,797 --> 01:21:12,733
<i>to their businesses
in their private surgeries.</i>

991
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:17,498
<i>First, I would like to
thank you for what you have been doing.</i>

992
01:21:17,606 --> 01:21:20,131
<i>You have been doing very well.</i>

993
01:21:20,242 --> 01:21:24,941
And to be a doctor
is not very easy thing,

994
01:21:25,046 --> 01:21:30,074
right from the time you have been born.

995
01:21:30,185 --> 01:21:33,416
Because you went through difficult...

996
01:21:33,521 --> 01:21:36,081
through primary schools.

997
01:21:36,191 --> 01:21:39,319
And you have been very intelligence.

998
01:21:39,427 --> 01:21:43,523
You pass your primary school.
You went to secondary schools.

999
01:21:43,632 --> 01:21:47,124
You pass.
You went into higher school.

1000
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:50,830
You pass.
You proved to be very intelligent.

1001
01:21:50,939 --> 01:21:54,466
And that is why
you have been selected...

1002
01:21:54,576 --> 01:21:57,136
to be a doctor.

1003
01:21:57,245 --> 01:22:01,545
I know this very well because
I come from very poor family.

1004
01:22:01,650 --> 01:22:03,618
I know how...

1005
01:22:03,718 --> 01:22:05,845
the person can come...

1006
01:22:05,954 --> 01:22:08,582
right from the village level...

1007
01:22:08,690 --> 01:22:11,181
up to the top standard of the doctor.

1008
01:22:11,293 --> 01:22:13,193
It is very difficult.

1009
01:22:13,295 --> 01:22:15,422
And don't spoil that chance.

1010
01:22:15,530 --> 01:22:18,192
When you have reached this standard,

1011
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:21,292
what you should do...
you should practice more.

1012
01:22:21,403 --> 01:22:23,371
You should specialize...

1013
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:28,170
in some more fields...

1014
01:22:28,276 --> 01:22:30,574
so that you will be able to help...

1015
01:22:30,679 --> 01:22:32,579
and assist the people in the country.

1016
01:22:32,681 --> 01:22:37,983
<i>And, as a doctor,
you must be very clean, very smart.</i>

1017
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:41,715
You behave very well like a person.

1018
01:22:41,823 --> 01:22:45,315
And also, you are not too drunk.

1019
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:50,091
You are the one
who should advise the public.

1020
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:53,793
You should advise General Amin
not to drink.

1021
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:56,928
This is very important.

1022
01:22:57,038 --> 01:22:59,006
This is the most important,

1023
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:02,736
because if a public learn...

1024
01:23:02,844 --> 01:23:04,869
that you are drunkard,

1025
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:08,245
<i>automatically they lose confidence.</i>

1026
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:10,409
And even they can say that,

1027
01:23:10,518 --> 01:23:13,453
if I am going to get operation
by that doctor,

1028
01:23:13,555 --> 01:23:16,456
he is a drunkard,
he will not do anything good for me.

1029
01:23:16,558 --> 01:23:21,359
And they will completely refuse.
I am telling you sincerely.

1030
01:23:21,463 --> 01:23:25,331
And it is true. I must be frank
to you and tell you this.

1031
01:23:25,433 --> 01:23:30,769
Because, also, to drink
and overdrunk... it is not very good.

1032
01:23:30,872 --> 01:23:34,569
<i>You will not even enjoy more.</i>

1033
01:23:34,676 --> 01:23:38,612
Because you will not even have sense.

1034
01:23:38,713 --> 01:23:42,149
But if you drink very little,
you feel very happy,

1035
01:23:42,250 --> 01:23:45,413
very proud, and you talk to the people.

1036
01:23:45,520 --> 01:23:48,318
That will be... I'm just advising you.

1037
01:23:55,263 --> 01:23:59,063
<i>If I am a commander of operations...</i>

1038
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:01,567
I wanted to fight...

1039
01:24:02,837 --> 01:24:05,101
in Lugasi sugar factory.

1040
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:07,197
<i>I just giving you this.</i>

1041
01:24:07,308 --> 01:24:09,469
Okay. There is enemy there.

1042
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:12,307
What I want to use... air force.

1043
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:14,382
What I will ask...

1044
01:24:14,482 --> 01:24:17,110
I will call the engineers.

1045
01:24:17,218 --> 01:24:19,652
I will call the pilots...

1046
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:21,949
and talk to them.

1047
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:25,151
Can you, from this base and this base...

1048
01:24:25,260 --> 01:24:29,390
can you reach Lugasi,
come back without refilling?

1049
01:24:29,497 --> 01:24:32,591
Yes. How long can you fight there?

1050
01:24:32,700 --> 01:24:34,600
Give me timing.

1051
01:24:34,702 --> 01:24:36,602
This technicians will be in position,

1052
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:40,071
advising before I give any order.

1053
01:24:40,175 --> 01:24:43,076
And they tells me completely
everything...

1054
01:24:43,178 --> 01:24:46,079
how long they will be there
and how long they will fight...

1055
01:24:46,181 --> 01:24:48,877
and what is the number
of the enemy and all this.

1056
01:24:48,983 --> 01:24:50,883
Then I write all this,

1057
01:24:50,985 --> 01:24:52,885
discussing with the technician.

1058
01:24:52,987 --> 01:24:57,014
This is like
a public service commission.

1059
01:24:57,125 --> 01:25:00,652
When they want to recruit the doctors,

1060
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:02,855
they come to you, you advise them.

1061
01:25:02,964 --> 01:25:05,762
But it is your duty as a doctor...

1062
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:08,301
to advise them properly...

1063
01:25:08,403 --> 01:25:10,837
and your duty as a doctor...

1064
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:14,773
to advise your representative...

1065
01:25:14,876 --> 01:25:18,573
who can represent you
or myself or him properly...

1066
01:25:18,680 --> 01:25:23,276
so that when he takes,
he brings the points...

1067
01:25:23,384 --> 01:25:28,219
concerning the medical field
in the cabinet to me,

1068
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:33,522
I have a full report...

1069
01:25:33,628 --> 01:25:35,619
submitted to me,

1070
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:38,130
not only by him,

1071
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:41,794
but by you, the technicians.

1072
01:25:41,903 --> 01:25:44,531
Because you know
the whole technical problem.

1073
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:46,834
Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen.

1074
01:25:53,615 --> 01:25:56,243
You have any points to tell me?

1075
01:25:58,386 --> 01:26:00,286
Yes?

1076
01:26:00,388 --> 01:26:03,482
<i>Your Excellence,
I'm quite happy to have heard...</i>

1077
01:26:03,591 --> 01:26:06,856
<i>that you are quite ready...</i>

1078
01:26:06,961 --> 01:26:09,293
<i>to be listening
to the senior doctors.</i>

1079
01:26:09,397 --> 01:26:13,857
Not only the senior doctors,
but the young doctors,

1080
01:26:13,968 --> 01:26:18,996
for the lives of the citizens
are in their hands.

1081
01:26:19,107 --> 01:26:22,736
In Uganda,
the Uganda Medical Association...

1082
01:26:22,844 --> 01:26:25,642
seems to be the main spokesman...

1083
01:26:25,747 --> 01:26:27,977
<i>for every doctor all over the country.</i>

1084
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:29,982
<i>The president of our association...</i>

1085
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:33,247
<i>In Uganda, only Amin
is allowed to be called president.</i>

1086
01:26:36,824 --> 01:26:38,724
You leave him to speak.

1087
01:26:40,061 --> 01:26:43,724
<i>- I withdraw the title...
- I am... I...</i>

1088
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:45,731
I am General Amin.

1089
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:51,537
<i>The chairman of our association,</i>

1090
01:26:51,639 --> 01:26:54,039
<i>who is a very active person,</i>

1091
01:26:54,142 --> 01:26:57,543
<i>who I am sure was not concerted
about these rumors...</i>

1092
01:26:57,645 --> 01:26:59,704
<i>which have been floating around...</i>

1093
01:26:59,814 --> 01:27:04,012
<i>about the private surgeries in town.</i>

1094
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:06,609
<i>So much so that he was...</i>

1095
01:27:06,721 --> 01:27:09,019
<i>and ourselves seriously caught unaware...</i>

1096
01:27:09,123 --> 01:27:11,614
<i>of what is happening.</i>

1097
01:27:11,726 --> 01:27:15,389
<i>With due respect to the minister,
Your Excellency,</i>

1098
01:27:15,496 --> 01:27:18,693
<i>and your technicians in Entebbe,</i>

1099
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:21,462
<i>I would like to tell you
that our chairman...</i>

1100
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:25,972
<i>is quite fluent with the problems
affecting the doctors...</i>

1101
01:27:26,074 --> 01:27:27,974
<i>on public health.</i>

1102
01:27:28,076 --> 01:27:30,340
<i>I would, therefore,</i>

1103
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:33,312
<i>request you, kindly and humbly,</i>

1104
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,439
<i>to keep him in mind...</i>

1105
01:27:35,550 --> 01:27:37,780
<i>that,
whenever there is any big problem...</i>

1106
01:27:37,885 --> 01:27:40,319
<i>that concerns a doctor,</i>

1107
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:43,584
<i>if you take off
your permanent secretary...</i>

1108
01:27:43,691 --> 01:27:46,558
<i>and if you are assistant
immediate to him,</i>

1109
01:27:46,661 --> 01:27:48,561
<i>the next man to consult...</i>

1110
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:52,292
<i>should be the chairman of
the Uganda Medical Association.</i>

1111
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:56,636
Thank you very much.

1112
01:27:56,738 --> 01:28:00,071
I like this type
of frank discussions.

1113
01:28:00,174 --> 01:28:02,074
And it is very good.

1114
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:04,076
Um, I am sure...

1115
01:28:04,178 --> 01:28:08,808
that I informed
the permanent secretary...

1116
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:11,407
I will be addressing...

1117
01:28:11,519 --> 01:28:13,783
the senior doctors...

1118
01:28:13,888 --> 01:28:16,254
within three days.
