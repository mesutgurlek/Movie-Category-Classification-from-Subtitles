00:00:06,906 --> 00:00:10,808
This film has been made possible by
the contribution of the Ministry of Culture,

2
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:15,708
which recognized this film
as a subject of Cultural Interest.

3
00:00:47,781 --> 00:00:50,807
a film by ENZO MONTELEONE

4
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,560
EL ALAMEIN - The Line of Fire

5
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,676
Okay, get off.

6
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,436
Nice here.

7
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:32,708
Sure is.

8
00:03:32,845 --> 00:03:34,210
What are you doing?

9
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:40,246
You never know, might find something.

10
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,455
If I'm lucky, this backwash
will be enough to get back.

11
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,862
How much longer?

12
00:03:54,033 --> 00:03:55,466
Are you in a hurry?

13
00:03:58,738 --> 00:03:59,932
We're almost there.

14
00:04:42,982 --> 00:04:46,383
Egypt - October 1942

15
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,919
This is it.

16
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,083
You're here.

17
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:55,021
Report over there.

18
00:04:56,663 --> 00:04:58,927
Okay, thanks.

19
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,626
Is that good water from El Daba?

20
00:05:03,703 --> 00:05:07,571
-Yes, a two-liter canteen.
-Don't let them steal it.

21
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:46,978
Pvt. Serra, reporting. I just got here.

22
00:05:48,147 --> 00:05:49,341
I've been posted here.

23
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:53,846
Lt. Fiore.

24
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:58,453
-Are you alone?
-What do you mean, sir?

25
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:02,123
I asked for substitutes,
I expected at least 10 men.

26
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:04,095
-Are you alone?
-Yes, sir.

27
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,101
Are you an urban vigilante?

28
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:14,629
I'm a University Volunteer.

29
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:18,074
I know what it stands for. It was a joke.

30
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,071
What do you study?

31
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,582
Literature and philosophy, third year.

32
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,878
Why didn't you finish?

33
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:30,616
I heard soldiers were needed
on the front, I'd be a coward not to go.

34
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:34,522
They said they'd send us to Africa,
so I signed up.

35
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:38,356
-Where are you from?
-Palermo.

36
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,893
What's being said in Italy?

37
00:06:41,267 --> 00:06:45,260
We'll arrive in Alexandria
and drive the British out of Egypt.

38
00:06:50,276 --> 00:06:51,834
How's the weather there?

39
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:59,251
Fall has begun,
but we're still swimming in Palermo.

40
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:05,218
-Is that good water?
-Yes.

41
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,315
Let me have a sip.

42
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,021
Come on.

43
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,375
Good.

44
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,813
Sorry, water's an issue here.

45
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:38,813
You'll join S. Sgt. Rizzo's Unit.

46
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:39,949
Corporal.

47
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,426
Take our student to Rizzo.

48
00:07:46,866 --> 00:07:49,699
Serra, some advice:

49
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,734
Take off that patch. It's useless here.

50
00:07:53,506 --> 00:07:54,734
Yes, sir.

51
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,777
Why did he tell me to remove it?

52
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,845
Some people have been in Africa
for two years now.

53
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:14,215
They've earned repatriation,
but can't get back home.

54
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,987
When they see someone
who could have stayed home...

55
00:08:19,065 --> 00:08:20,896
but decided to volunteer...

56
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,101
they get ticked off.

57
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:53,257
What was that?

58
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,665
British 88's.

59
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,495
They always shoot four at a time...

60
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,474
but the ones that hit you sound different.

61
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:06,302
It's the first thing you need to know.

62
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,576
If you want to get out alive,
perk up your ears.

63
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,517
Give me some of your water.

64
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,630
Excuse me...

65
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:35,170
I haven't had real water in so long.

66
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:40,340
Get down, this'll hit us!

67
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:55,357
Corporal!

68
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,110
Who are you? What happened?

69
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:26,614
Pvt. Serra.
I have to join Sergeant Rizzo's Unit.

70
00:10:27,193 --> 00:10:31,527
They shot at me and the Corporal,
but I can't find him anymore.

71
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:35,599
I'm Rizzo. De Vita and Spagna.

72
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:41,303
-Who was the Corporal?
-Part of the command company.

73
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,476
Boys, take a look around.

74
00:10:55,021 --> 00:10:56,215
I found this.

75
00:11:03,095 --> 00:11:05,859
He became sand. It happens.

76
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:07,723
We'll report it.

77
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,768
You used up your first miracle.

78
00:11:09,969 --> 00:11:12,199
Just got here and already used up a miracle.

79
00:11:12,271 --> 00:11:13,260
What miracle?

80
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:14,533
That's enough. Let's go.

81
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,736
-Is that good water?
-Yes.

82
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,619
Stay low.

83
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,560
Set yourself up there,
a guy from Padua used to be here...

84
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,833
he got hit by a grenade splinter.
It literally pierced his stomach.

85
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:56,470
-Is he dead?
-The war is over for him.

86
00:12:56,876 --> 00:13:01,176
He's in a hospital in Bengasi.
They will send him home soon.

87
00:13:02,214 --> 00:13:03,647
Come, I'll brief you.

88
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,681
To the right, the Qattara Depression.

89
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:13,788
Not much to worry about.

90
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:19,025
There's a minefield past the barbed wire,
then no man's land.

91
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:23,726
The British are over there,
you can't see them.

92
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:28,939
But they see us clearly
and send their 88's here.

93
00:13:30,242 --> 00:13:33,211
Keep low during the day, we move at night.

94
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,707
Our artillery?

95
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:40,677
The remaining cannons are in the north.

96
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:46,351
We're in the south sector,
abandoned by God.

97
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:50,153
First rule: keep your head low.

98
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:54,992
Second: if you get dysentery
don't report sick, we all have it.

99
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,223
Just cope with it.

100
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,294
Third: vipers and scorpions.

101
00:13:59,705 --> 00:14:02,196
Watch where you put your hands
and when you put on your shoes...

102
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:05,072
because scorpions look for warm places
at night.

103
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,309
A quarter liter of water a day.

104
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,008
If you're used to washing up,
learn how to do it with sand.

105
00:14:11,817 --> 00:14:14,911
Rations arrive after dusk,
but often don't show up.

106
00:14:14,987 --> 00:14:17,478
You'll have to make do
with canned goods and biscuits.

107
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:22,349
Cigarettes in abundance,
but matches are scarce.

108
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:26,264
-Got that?
-Yes.

109
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:27,791
Any questions?

110
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:31,399
-The mail?
-On and off.

111
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:52,482
<i>Beloved Mom, Dear Father...</i>

112
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:55,927
<i>I've finally arrived on the front line.</i>

113
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,961
<i>My unit is posted</i>
<i>in the southernmost point of the front...</i>

114
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,330
<i>near the Qattara Depression.</i>

115
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:08,573
<i>I'm the youngest.</i>
<i>The others are veterans of Africa.</i>

116
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,572
<i>Everything is empty, immense.</i>

117
00:15:14,847 --> 00:15:16,815
<i>I've yet to see real war.</i>

118
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:22,312
<i>It's not what I expected.</i>
<i>I imagined something else.:</i>

119
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:25,556
<i>clashes, battles, gunfights.</i>

120
00:15:27,059 --> 00:15:30,290
<i>Our real enemies now</i>
<i>are thirst and dysentery.</i>

121
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:33,795
<i>We must be careful...</i>

122
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:38,727
<i>because we can die suddenly,</i>
<i>unexpectedly...</i>

123
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,899
<i>without ever seeing the enemy.</i>

124
00:15:42,007 --> 00:15:45,943
<i>I hope I'll distinguish myself</i>
<i>and make you proud of me.</i>

125
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,420
Spagna, where the fuck are you?

126
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,844
-Everything okay?
-Yes, Lieutenant.

127
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:43,063
If that had hit our pit, goodbye homeland.

128
00:16:46,872 --> 00:16:48,703
-Lieutenant.
-How's it going?

129
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:49,763
Fine.

130
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,371
Well, they keep getting closer.

131
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:56,847
Lieutenant, two wounded
in the connection zone.

132
00:16:56,915 --> 00:16:59,213
-Hit by 88's?
-No, by a sniper.

133
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,243
What?

134
00:17:04,156 --> 00:17:05,214
Let's go.

135
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:09,058
What happened?

136
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:13,724
The two linemen were adjusting
the telephone cables...

137
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:15,733
and they were shot by a sniper.

138
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:18,326
-How did he get there?
-We don't know.

139
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:20,834
He must have arrived last night.
He wasn't there yesterday.

140
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,378
Stretcher bearers!

141
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:36,751
-Where is he?
-Perhaps behind those wrecks.

142
00:17:40,826 --> 00:17:42,123
Lieutenant, sir.

143
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:46,256
-Do you feel like going?
-Yes.

144
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:52,594
Be careful.
He may disregard your armbands.

145
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:54,498
We'll go anyway.

146
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:07,318
Run! Hide!

147
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,382
He got him.

148
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:16,222
Did you see where he's shooting from?

149
00:18:16,295 --> 00:18:19,230
I saw a spark from behind that truck.

150
00:18:20,232 --> 00:18:21,221
Are you sure?

151
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,791
-Yes. I saw him clearly.
-We need the mortar.

152
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:26,166
-Who'll go call Tarozzi?
-Me.

153
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:30,331
Go to the command post,
get him, and bring him here.

154
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:32,103
He needs to bring his 81, hurry.

155
00:18:33,912 --> 00:18:35,402
Stay low and always run for cover!

156
00:18:53,098 --> 00:18:55,498
-Where's Tarozzi?
-Over there.

157
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:02,633
-Who's Tarozzi?
-Me.

158
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,199
Lt. Fiore needs you, hurry.

159
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,179
You called for me?

160
00:19:19,925 --> 00:19:21,688
Set up the mortar.

161
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,863
-Ready.
-Come here.

162
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,635
-See that wreck?
-Yes.

163
00:19:39,311 --> 00:19:42,769
There's a sniper in there, blow it to pieces.

164
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,077
Yes, sir.

165
00:19:57,796 --> 00:19:58,785
Cover!

166
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:22,711
You son of a bitch!

167
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:26,884
Go to hell!

168
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:29,617
Don't shoot!

169
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,729
Damn you! To hell!

170
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,063
Don't waste ammunition!

171
00:20:36,802 --> 00:20:37,791
Bastards!

172
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,339
Listen...

173
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:46,971
shall we blow up this son of a bitch?

174
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:48,069
Yes, sir.

175
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,342
-See what he did to our boys?
-Yes, sir.

176
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:58,420
Then concentrate
and send him straight to hell.

177
00:20:58,490 --> 00:20:59,718
Got it?

178
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:02,450
I'll get him, I swear.

179
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:17,332
Cover!

180
00:21:31,356 --> 00:21:34,951
Get the wounded man
and take him to the infirmary.

181
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,525
Fix the cables. Good job, Tarozzi.

182
00:21:39,498 --> 00:21:40,590
Let's go.

183
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:45,793
You're a champ.

184
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:17,925
What a sight.

185
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,135
They remind me of my town's fireworks.

186
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,908
The rations arrived today.

187
00:22:36,955 --> 00:22:39,048
Tasty sand and rice mush.

188
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:49,799
Know why rations arrive at night?

189
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,695
So we can't see all the flies in the food.

190
00:22:57,409 --> 00:22:58,967
When do you think we'll attack?

191
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:03,171
When will we get to Alexandria, to Cairo?

192
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:06,144
Maybe you don't get it.

193
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,685
We've been here four months
and haven't advanced a meter.

194
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:15,518
Cairo, the pyramids,
we can forget about them.

195
00:23:17,696 --> 00:23:20,062
You've become an expert
on military strategies?

196
00:23:20,866 --> 00:23:21,992
It's common sense.

197
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:25,761
Our provisions are in Libya,
Bengasi and Derna.

198
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,264
That's 1,000 kilometers from here.

199
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:35,470
We're far from everything
that's why nothing arrives on the front line.

200
00:23:36,681 --> 00:23:38,512
But the British bases are nearby.

201
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,816
They switch off every 15 days.

202
00:23:43,388 --> 00:23:45,322
They take leave and go have fun.

203
00:23:45,991 --> 00:23:48,255
Rommel isn't just any guy...

204
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,362
he whipped the British pretty badly.

205
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:54,498
If he made it this far,
why can't he advance some more?

206
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,231
If he stopped,
something must have happened.

207
00:23:58,670 --> 00:24:02,538
Supplies and ammunition haven't arrived.

208
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,540
Gas hasn't arrived and neither has water.

209
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,881
I think the British will attack soon.

210
00:24:11,883 --> 00:24:13,908
Even if they do, they won't get through here.

211
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:18,347
They won't kick us out.

212
00:24:20,091 --> 00:24:21,285
We're like boulders:

213
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,127
firm, solid, immovable...

214
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:27,391
neither forward...

215
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,624
nor backward.

216
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:38,771
-Sergeant, what do you think?
-That you talk too much.

217
00:24:39,711 --> 00:24:43,579
Once you start thinking, you're dead.

218
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:47,416
Just do as you're told.

219
00:24:48,587 --> 00:24:49,849
And if I have to die...

220
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,350
I'll die.

221
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:59,462
I'm sure of one thing: that I won't surrender.

222
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,693
They won't take me...

223
00:25:03,902 --> 00:25:06,769
not alive.

224
00:25:12,878 --> 00:25:14,368
What is it?

225
00:25:14,446 --> 00:25:17,904
A British truck. It drove over a mine.

226
00:25:17,983 --> 00:25:19,883
-Let's go.
-Where?

227
00:25:19,951 --> 00:25:21,213
To do some shopping.

228
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:05,195
There are mines here.

229
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:07,689
Stay in line behind me.

230
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:12,563
I don't want to have to scrape you
off the ground.

231
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:45,565
-Sergeant.
-What?

232
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:49,972
I stepped on something.

233
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,667
Don't move.

234
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,506
Stay still.

235
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,677
You lucked out.

236
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:31,875
Move.

237
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,042
Slowly.

238
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:40,220
It's an anti-tank mine.
They're calibrated for 300 kilos.

239
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,686
If it was an anti-personnel mine,
you'd be gone.

240
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:48,989
Christ, be careful.

241
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:55,963
You used up your second miracle.

242
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:57,230
Damn.

243
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,451
What do we have here?

244
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,838
Look.

245
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:41,343
These British have it all.

246
00:28:41,853 --> 00:28:44,253
Chocolate, whiskey, jam...

247
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:47,719
Everything, even canned fruit.

248
00:29:13,985 --> 00:29:17,113
Sergeant, he's alive!

249
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:19,217
What'll we do?

250
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:23,186
The British will come get him,
they'll handle it.

251
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:24,623
Let's hurry up.

252
00:29:26,297 --> 00:29:28,026
Come on, let's go.

253
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:30,798
Serra, move it.

254
00:29:54,492 --> 00:29:55,550
Good stuff.

255
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:00,655
Want some?

256
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:02,091
British vitamins.

257
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:12,132
All this talk about miracles...

258
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:15,670
what is it?

259
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:21,475
Look at this.

260
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:25,048
It was on my head.

261
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:30,255
A bullet entered here and exited here.

262
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,094
I could have died.

263
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:36,193
But I didn't...

264
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:38,526
I felt...

265
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:42,065
a breeze through my hair.

266
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:45,637
What would you call that?

267
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,480
When you step on a mine
that doesn't explode...

268
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,541
grenade splinters hit the pit...

269
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:56,715
and the guy next to you dies...

270
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,456
these are miracles.

271
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:12,326
The Corporal turned to sand,
you didn't even get a scratch.

272
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,466
That was your first miracle.

273
00:31:17,775 --> 00:31:20,835
Here, we are each allotted three miracles.

274
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,014
You've only got one left.

275
00:31:26,684 --> 00:31:28,481
Afterwards all you can do is pray.

276
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:35,118
And you, how many do you have left?

277
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:42,800
We used them up long ago.

278
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:45,195
Don't worry...

279
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,939
if you're going to die,
it shows the day before.

280
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,807
How can you tell?

281
00:31:52,377 --> 00:31:55,904
Your nose becomes thin and long...

282
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:01,979
and your ears, transparent like tissue paper.

283
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,852
You're pulling my leg, right?

284
00:32:35,253 --> 00:32:36,720
Good morning, Lieutenant.

285
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:40,723
-What have you got there?
-Where are we?

286
00:32:42,060 --> 00:32:46,394
-Naqb Rala, south sector, why?
-I knew I'd get lost. Damn!

287
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:50,925
These trails are all alike,
nothing but fucking sand.

288
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:55,395
-These aren't supply trucks?
-No, special transport.

289
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,206
I'm supposed to go to El Daba...

290
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,402
but I had to change route
because of a bombardment.

291
00:32:59,711 --> 00:33:02,976
El Daba is on the northern coast,
at least 80 kilometers away.

292
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:09,781
-It's full of shoe polish.
-What?

293
00:33:13,424 --> 00:33:15,790
For the parade, when we reach Alexandria.

294
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:20,327
What's in this truck?

295
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:24,490
A horse. Mussolini's, for the parade.

296
00:33:25,203 --> 00:33:26,864
We could roast it with potatoes.

297
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:30,869
You can't touch it, I have to bring it back.

298
00:33:31,275 --> 00:33:33,300
Then say the British took it as a prisoner.

299
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:37,206
Do something, you tell them.

300
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:42,019
You keep this. I'm confiscating the horse.

301
00:33:42,086 --> 00:33:45,146
-Pull it out.
-You can't, it's Mussolini's horse.

302
00:33:45,223 --> 00:33:47,691
If anything happens, they'll shoot me.

303
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:52,054
Bullshit. Tell them I took it,
they can come to me.

304
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:53,790
Open up.

305
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,251
It really is Mussolini's personal horse...

306
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:25,789
I swear.

307
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:28,890
You don't get it.

308
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:35,268
Tell Mussolini we've been eating sand
and drinking piss for months.

309
00:34:35,606 --> 00:34:38,632
If he wants to march in Alexandria
with his horse and shiny boots...

310
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:41,837
he's got to send us arms, uniforms...

311
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:46,873
water, shoes, food, medicine,
and fresh troops to replace us.

312
00:34:47,952 --> 00:34:50,819
He has to send the air force
to bomb the British.

313
00:34:53,224 --> 00:34:56,523
Forget about shoe shines.

314
00:34:57,128 --> 00:34:58,220
Got it?

315
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:05,962
Who's going to kill it?

316
00:35:09,574 --> 00:35:10,700
Who's going to kill it?

317
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:24,844
Sorry, you're a beauty
but we're in bad shape.

318
00:35:50,081 --> 00:35:53,676
Take it, get lost.

319
00:36:31,255 --> 00:36:35,157
<i>Beloved Mom, Dear Father,</i>
<i>today we're moving.</i>

320
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:39,754
<i>The Lieutenant is sending us</i>
<i>behind the front to get bins of water.</i>

321
00:36:40,298 --> 00:36:42,823
<i>After weeks of being stuck in the pits...</i>

322
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:45,391
<i>riding in the desert tastes like freedom.</i>

323
00:36:47,104 --> 00:36:48,833
<i>We seem to smell the sea.</i>

324
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:51,805
<i>It's 60 kilometers away...</i>

325
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,704
<i>but for us, it's more unreachable</i>
<i>than a mirage.</i>

326
00:36:57,481 --> 00:36:59,540
<i>The names here</i>
<i>are straight out of</i> The Arabian Nights:

327
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:03,448
<i>Camel Plains, Dove Hills...</i>

328
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,545
<i>Gazelle Cliff.</i>

329
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:10,851
<i>But they are mere dots on the map</i>
<i>that only the Bedouins can recognize.</i>

330
00:37:14,365 --> 00:37:17,425
-Are we lost?
-No.

331
00:37:18,369 --> 00:37:19,700
Know where we are?

332
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,998
More or less.

333
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:23,835
It's all the same here...

334
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:26,607
even the names...

335
00:37:27,111 --> 00:37:30,080
Qaret el Khadim, Qattaret el Diyura...

336
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:33,848
Qaret el Yidma. All the same.

337
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:39,281
They said there were palm trees,
but I don't see any.

338
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:44,160
We should be near, try that way.

339
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,103
There they are.

340
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:27,428
No one's here.

341
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:45,381
-Are you from the Pavia Division?
-Yes, that's us.

342
00:38:46,390 --> 00:38:47,652
I thought you got lost.

343
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:53,922
It's all yours.

344
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,573
Tastes like diesel!

345
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:16,219
Tanks we stole from the Germans.

346
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,278
We have to drink diesel-tainted water?

347
00:39:19,156 --> 00:39:21,124
You should thank God I brought them.

348
00:39:21,726 --> 00:39:23,717
How long since you've gotten
a water supply?

349
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,463
Seems you're not doing well.

350
00:39:27,798 --> 00:39:31,359
We can't drink this water, we're not animals!

351
00:39:31,602 --> 00:39:33,661
Enough, let's unload it.

352
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,841
All wasted water.

353
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:48,279
Know how many I've transported
through this desert?

354
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:52,180
Thousands of tanks, and what for?

355
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:55,588
To rinse the generals' underwear.

356
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,955
Then they complain
we don't move forward or backward.

357
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:01,923
Bullshit!

358
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,090
I've got a solution.

359
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:05,926
What?

360
00:40:06,103 --> 00:40:09,504
If I transported grappa...

361
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,564
we'd be at the pyramids by now.

362
00:40:11,976 --> 00:40:14,604
In WW1, we Italians along the Piave River...

363
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:18,446
were all drunk, otherwise,
like hell would we have won.

364
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:21,183
I feel generous today.

365
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:29,585
Drink, men are supposed to drink wine.

366
00:40:30,494 --> 00:40:33,361
Use the water for the truck radiators.

367
00:40:41,038 --> 00:40:42,733
Spagna, how long since you've had a bath?

368
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:45,934
Do I smell?

369
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,137
Sure, we all stink!

370
00:40:48,212 --> 00:40:49,509
I asked because...

371
00:40:50,514 --> 00:40:52,675
about 40 kilometers from here...

372
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,944
is the sea.

373
00:40:56,153 --> 00:41:00,146
-How would you feel about a swim?
-Are you crazy?

374
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:05,050
-We'll dive in and leave.
-Then they'll court-martial us all.

375
00:41:05,729 --> 00:41:08,562
Let's vote. Shall we go or not?

376
00:41:10,234 --> 00:41:11,360
Let's go.

377
00:41:12,336 --> 00:41:14,600
-Shall we go?
-Yes!

378
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,505
Sure, fuck it!

379
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,841
Why don't we stay here?

380
00:44:12,216 --> 00:44:14,707
We'll hide away and wait here
for the end of the war.

381
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,585
Hey, what are you doing?

382
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,292
Who are you?

383
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:27,624
Pavia Division, we're on a mission.

384
00:44:27,898 --> 00:44:31,425
That's a mined area. Get out of there!

385
00:44:50,287 --> 00:44:53,814
Sergeant, is what they say true?

386
00:44:55,993 --> 00:44:57,153
What do they say?

387
00:44:58,028 --> 00:45:01,930
That the British took you as prisoner
and you managed to flee.

388
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:08,502
They caught me when Bengasi fell.

389
00:45:10,974 --> 00:45:14,466
They brought us to a POW camp in Egypt.

390
00:45:15,746 --> 00:45:17,236
Some were glad...

391
00:45:18,282 --> 00:45:21,911
because they figured
the war was over for them.

392
00:45:23,987 --> 00:45:27,548
Being a prisoner is horrible for a soldier.

393
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,254
It's humiliating...

394
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:34,922
it's a non-life.

395
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:40,602
A soldier's duty is to fight,
a prisoner's is to flee.

396
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:43,572
I didn't want to rot away in Kenya or India.

397
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,434
I managed to go back to Bengasi.

398
00:45:50,481 --> 00:45:51,539
The British were still there.

399
00:45:51,782 --> 00:45:55,343
For three months I hid out
at a friend's place...

400
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:57,878
in a brothel.

401
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,121
It was the best time of my life.

402
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:08,956
Then when we liberated Bengasi...

403
00:46:09,266 --> 00:46:10,631
I went back to my troop.

404
00:46:11,335 --> 00:46:13,599
-How long have you been in Africa?
-Two years.

405
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:16,205
-You never went back to Italy?
-No.

406
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:26,143
This is a cursed place.
You boil in the day, and freeze at night.

407
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,046
But what a sky.

408
00:46:33,323 --> 00:46:35,348
I'd never seen a sky like this.

409
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,523
The desert plays with you...

410
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:46,860
makes you think strange things.

411
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:52,098
I'm sure of one thing.

412
00:46:53,210 --> 00:46:54,199
When we go home...

413
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,842
if we save our hides...

414
00:47:00,384 --> 00:47:02,909
we'll miss this wretched place.

415
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:08,088
The minefields, the sand, the pits...

416
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:12,654
Everything.

417
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:18,732
We'll miss hunger and thirst.

418
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:41,708
-It's cooked.
-A brush of oil and rosemary.

419
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:47,482
Lieutenant, want some?

420
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:49,519
Fire up two steaks!

421
00:48:49,893 --> 00:48:52,293
-What is this stuff?
-Camel steaks.

422
00:48:52,696 --> 00:48:55,392
-Where did they come from?
-Serra did it.

423
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:00,930
Wait.

424
00:49:01,405 --> 00:49:02,929
What does that mean?

425
00:49:04,107 --> 00:49:07,304
-Weren't you on lookout today?
-Yes, sir.

426
00:49:09,012 --> 00:49:12,175
Tell me exactly where you found the camel.

427
00:49:12,582 --> 00:49:13,947
Right in front of me.

428
00:49:14,418 --> 00:49:18,081
-At the lookout point?
-Yes, near there.

429
00:49:18,422 --> 00:49:19,480
Christ.

430
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,249
Show me.

431
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:33,735
-Here?
-There, see the blood?

432
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:43,512
-How was it killed?
-I shot it.

433
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:47,574
Isn't this supposed to be a mined area?

434
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:49,078
I believe so.

435
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:53,316
How did the camel get here
without blowing up?

436
00:49:53,590 --> 00:49:54,648
I don't know.

437
00:49:55,625 --> 00:49:58,116
The camel didn't come here by chance.

438
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:00,755
The British sent it into the minefield.

439
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:05,291
If it doesn't blow up, that means it's safe.

440
00:50:08,271 --> 00:50:09,738
We have to check the area.

441
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,157
What's the situation?

442
00:50:34,931 --> 00:50:36,455
It's all de-mined here.

443
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:39,726
There's a clear path
of at least five meters here.

444
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:42,728
-Can you close the gap?
-We'll try.

445
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:59,414
Any news from command?

446
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:02,057
We've been cut off, we know nothing.

447
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:06,261
They say the British are preparing an attack.

448
00:51:06,696 --> 00:51:07,856
It's a matter of days.

449
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:09,330
They're waiting for the full moon.

450
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:12,193
This time, it'll be a major attack.

451
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:17,935
We keep finding de-mined areas
along the front.

452
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:23,770
-Which sector will they attack?
-They say to be on guard.

453
00:51:24,581 --> 00:51:27,345
They saw heavy movement
of vehicles and troops.

454
00:51:28,718 --> 00:51:31,448
Our command is moving
the Ariete tanks toward the north.

455
00:51:33,790 --> 00:51:35,815
But that'll leave our rear uncovered.

456
00:51:36,393 --> 00:51:38,623
If they attack with tanks,
how will we stop them?

457
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:40,686
That's what I heard.

458
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:43,294
Call us if you need us.

459
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,524
Thanks.

460
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:49,656
You called for me, sir?

461
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:52,699
Rizzo, sit down.

462
00:52:58,575 --> 00:52:59,837
This arrived.

463
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:03,001
We're on general alert.

464
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:06,008
After that de-mined area...

465
00:53:06,116 --> 00:53:09,574
they asked me to send a unit
to check the Depression.

466
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,051
The Depression?

467
00:53:13,423 --> 00:53:17,450
They want to be sure the enemy
won't attack through the Depression.

468
00:53:18,862 --> 00:53:20,591
That's impossible.

469
00:53:21,665 --> 00:53:24,998
The Depression is impassable,
even for Bedouins.

470
00:53:25,235 --> 00:53:29,831
It says here to send some men to verify.

471
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:33,606
You must find out what happened
to the Bersaglieri Unit...

472
00:53:34,344 --> 00:53:36,369
which was posted on look-out.

473
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:39,514
They haven't reported back in days. Got it?

474
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:42,177
Good.

475
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,916
Get one of your men and leave right away.

476
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:47,917
All right.

477
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:55,831
-lf we encounter the enemy?
-Leave immediately.

478
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:59,058
Units are only useful if they return.

479
00:54:01,204 --> 00:54:03,001
Yes, Lieutenant.

480
00:54:05,875 --> 00:54:07,240
Good luck.

481
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:22,715
Know why I chose you?

482
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:27,411
Because you're the youngest,
you're a volunteer...

483
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:30,218
and the last to arrive.

484
00:55:47,777 --> 00:55:50,746
We're below sea level here, right?

485
00:55:52,749 --> 00:55:55,718
<i>According to the map we're at 70 below.</i>

486
00:55:57,454 --> 00:56:01,720
<i>It's an oven,</i>
<i>it must be at least 50 degrees Celsius.</i>

487
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:07,228
<i>Don't think about it. The more you think</i>
<i>about it, the hotter it feels.</i>

488
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,425
<i>How far have we gone?</i>

489
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,905
<i>About 12 kilometers.</i>

490
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:21,033
<i>Sergeant, what is it?</i>

491
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,376
<i>It's a mirage.</i>

492
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:27,508
<i>They call it Morgan le Fay.</i>

493
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,419
What shitty shoes. I got blisters all over.

494
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:26,132
What is it?

495
00:57:36,886 --> 00:57:39,150
I wonder who drew these.

496
00:57:41,758 --> 00:57:43,316
Once, this area was all green.

497
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:49,456
There was water, trees, animals...

498
00:57:50,934 --> 00:57:54,563
When the ancient Romans were here?

499
00:57:56,239 --> 00:57:57,763
Long before that...

500
00:58:00,009 --> 00:58:04,241
at least 10,000 years ago.

501
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:05,712
10,000?

502
00:58:07,283 --> 00:58:09,308
I can't even imagine a number like that.

503
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:16,819
Studying teaches you lots of things.

504
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:22,998
I finished elementary school,
I can read and write...

505
00:58:24,434 --> 00:58:25,526
but that's it.

506
00:58:27,470 --> 00:58:30,234
At age 10, I was in the hills with the cows.

507
00:58:35,178 --> 00:58:37,112
Know what I miss most?

508
00:58:38,248 --> 00:58:40,739
The green fields behind my house.

509
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:45,581
There's a plum tree.

510
00:58:46,656 --> 00:58:48,521
I sit under it...

511
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:51,749
and look up.

512
00:58:58,568 --> 00:59:01,503
-Know how to ski?
-No.

513
00:59:04,774 --> 00:59:07,072
Back home,
the first snow has already fallen.

514
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:46,541
See anyone?

515
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:52,044
No, no one.

516
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:54,186
Nothing.

517
00:59:55,858 --> 00:59:57,291
What if the British are there?

518
00:59:59,395 --> 01:00:01,260
They'll shoot at us.

519
01:02:01,884 --> 01:02:06,218
If the British made it here,
they can make it anywhere.

520
01:02:08,357 --> 01:02:10,018
They're more Bedouin than the Bedouins.

521
01:02:12,161 --> 01:02:13,992
What will we do now?

522
01:02:16,799 --> 01:02:18,061
We'll go back.

523
01:02:58,541 --> 01:03:00,532
-Is today the 23rd?
-What?

524
01:03:03,012 --> 01:03:04,343
Is it October 23rd?

525
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:06,773
Yes.

526
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:08,675
Why?

527
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:10,583
It's my wife's birthday.

528
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:14,249
How old is she?

529
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:17,487
30.

530
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:21,996
I haven't seen her in two years.

531
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,799
I wonder if she'd recognize me.

532
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:35,335
That's the north.

533
01:03:36,646 --> 01:03:38,136
Those are our posts.

534
01:03:38,247 --> 01:03:41,307
These aren't the usual 88's. Let's go.

535
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:33,227
De Vita.

536
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:41,104
What are you doing?

537
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,274
Fixing the case.

538
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:48,916
It's all broken.

539
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:52,178
How are you?

540
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:54,381
Fine.

541
01:04:55,825 --> 01:04:57,190
What happened to you?

542
01:04:59,562 --> 01:05:00,824
Nothing, why?

543
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:05,663
-Your hair turned white.
-Really?

544
01:05:08,504 --> 01:05:10,768
-Where's Spagna?
-Spagna...

545
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,130
Spagna, how are you?

546
01:05:40,403 --> 01:05:44,305
It came down like hail.

547
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:46,440
What happened to De Vita?

548
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:51,706
A grenade landed three meters from him,
made a huge hole, but he's fine.

549
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:54,511
Not a scratch, just his hair.

550
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:58,544
How many boys did we lose?

551
01:06:00,022 --> 01:06:03,423
At least 20, between dead and injured.

552
01:06:20,576 --> 01:06:23,875
What we expected has happened,
the battle has begun.

553
01:06:25,147 --> 01:06:27,081
The British attacked the entire front.

554
01:06:28,951 --> 01:06:33,012
They bombed us, but they didn't attack
with tanks and infantry.

555
01:06:35,491 --> 01:06:38,187
They tried to break through
the Folgore sector.

556
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:43,331
They suffered great losses there...

557
01:06:45,534 --> 01:06:47,024
entire companies destroyed...

558
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,631
but they held their position.

559
01:06:51,107 --> 01:06:54,167
They stopped the tanks
with incendiary bottles.

560
01:06:56,445 --> 01:07:00,438
An attack is expected tonight,
with the full moon.

561
01:07:02,985 --> 01:07:06,352
Our 28th is with Ruspoli's group
at point 105.

562
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,990
They want us to go there.

563
01:07:10,292 --> 01:07:12,351
A gap has opened, they want us to patch it.

564
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:17,565
Are they sending us to croak, sir?

565
01:08:36,679 --> 01:08:38,909
-Who are you?
-Pavia Division.

566
01:08:41,217 --> 01:08:42,479
I'm Lt. Fiore.

567
01:08:43,052 --> 01:08:45,919
Lt. Sforza of Folgore,
we were waiting for you.

568
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:47,779
How's your situation here?

569
01:08:48,591 --> 01:08:53,085
Last night was a nightmare.
The British bashed us.

570
01:08:53,362 --> 01:08:57,731
The 19th is gone, the 22nd
has few remaining defense posts...

571
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,028
and the 6th is surrounded.

572
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:01,363
We don't know how long they'll hold up.

573
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:05,435
We stopped them
by burning about 30 British tanks.

574
01:09:07,610 --> 01:09:10,807
They told us to reinforce Ruspoli's group
at point 105.

575
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:16,009
Ruspoli's gone, he died this afternoon.

576
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:21,218
An 88 hit his truck, three officers died.
One from the Pavia Division.

577
01:09:25,694 --> 01:09:26,718
What should we do?

578
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:30,557
Take post at point 1 15,
between the 24th and 20th.

579
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,824
One of my soldiers will bring you there.

580
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:34,896
Are there tanks?

581
01:09:35,471 --> 01:09:38,201
They promised us the Ariete tanks
and the German Panzers...

582
01:09:38,307 --> 01:09:41,834
but we can only count on our forces now.

583
01:10:10,005 --> 01:10:13,133
You three with the Breda, in here.

584
01:10:15,344 --> 01:10:18,336
Tarozzi, there with the mortar.

585
01:10:19,748 --> 01:10:21,272
Three more in there.

586
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:24,517
Serra, De Vita, in here.

587
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:27,681
Find some sacks and rebuild the wall.

588
01:10:28,891 --> 01:10:30,552
You two, in here.

589
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,427
Rizzo, there.

590
01:10:35,130 --> 01:10:38,122
You two, in here, set up the pit.

591
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:41,668
Spagna, get three men and stay here.

592
01:10:45,674 --> 01:10:49,235
Boys, come here. Three more with me.

593
01:10:49,411 --> 01:10:50,844
Take these sandbags.

594
01:10:52,881 --> 01:10:53,939
You two, in here.

595
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:01,012
De Vita, here.

596
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:05,853
You all, in here.

597
01:11:05,928 --> 01:11:07,190
You three, over here.

598
01:11:12,735 --> 01:11:14,930
Remove what you don't need from the pits.

599
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:18,534
Distribute the ammunition.

600
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:29,413
-De Vita, knock it off!
-I'm fixing it.

601
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:30,918
Fix it some other time.

602
01:11:33,722 --> 01:11:35,189
Fine.

603
01:11:59,048 --> 01:12:00,948
I brought some amphetamines.

604
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:04,718
So you'll stay awake.

605
01:13:12,788 --> 01:13:14,881
Get down!

606
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:05,373
De Vita! Where the fuck are you going?

607
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:07,473
Come back here!

608
01:20:23,018 --> 01:20:27,182
<i>Finally, war, the real kind, has arrived.</i>

609
01:20:29,524 --> 01:20:33,153
<i>I kept an eye on it,</i>
<i>like a bus on the corner of a street.</i>

610
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:36,964
<i>The British broke through the first line...</i>

611
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,725
<i>but they were stopped by the artillery.</i>

612
01:20:41,036 --> 01:20:45,132
<i>They got stuck in the minefields</i>
<i>and had to turn back.</i>

613
01:20:46,408 --> 01:20:48,273
<i>Maybe this was the third miracle.</i>

614
01:20:52,514 --> 01:20:54,243
<i>Today I looked horror in the face.</i>

615
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:58,041
<i>At school they teach us.:</i>

616
01:20:59,321 --> 01:21:01,346
<i>"Lucky is he who dies a hero. "</i>

617
01:21:02,924 --> 01:21:04,755
<i>I've seen many of these heroes.</i>

618
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:08,860
<i>Those who die are neither lucky</i>
<i>nor unlucky.</i>

619
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:12,030
<i>They are just dead.</i>

620
01:21:14,169 --> 01:21:16,069
<i>They rot at the bottom of a pit...</i>

621
01:21:16,905 --> 01:21:18,338
<i>without a shred of poetry.</i>

622
01:21:21,309 --> 01:21:23,368
<i>Death is beautiful only in school books.</i>

623
01:21:24,579 --> 01:21:27,309
<i>In real life it's pitiful, horrendous...</i>

624
01:21:27,949 --> 01:21:28,973
<i>and it stinks.</i>

625
01:22:11,793 --> 01:22:13,260
This time, I'm going home.

626
01:22:14,262 --> 01:22:15,820
Of course.

627
01:22:17,432 --> 01:22:19,127
They'll even give you a medal.

628
01:22:20,335 --> 01:22:22,530
If you're lucky, it'll happen to you, too.

629
01:22:29,511 --> 01:22:30,569
See you back in Italy.

630
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:34,877
See you in Italy.

631
01:22:48,797 --> 01:22:50,287
Write to me, Sergeant.

632
01:22:51,132 --> 01:22:53,225
Got it? Write to me.

633
01:23:44,619 --> 01:23:45,847
What do they say?

634
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:50,017
Il Duce deems it necessary
to maintain the front at all costs.

635
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:53,155
Win or die.

636
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,167
<i>The big battle moved up north.</i>

637
01:24:08,376 --> 01:24:10,344
<i>It overthrew us like a flooded river.</i>

638
01:24:10,845 --> 01:24:12,836
<i>Then, once the flood passed...</i>

639
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:15,241
<i>it all went back to normal.</i>

640
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:18,515
<i>It seems they've all forgotten about us.</i>

641
01:24:19,054 --> 01:24:21,682
<i>Our enemies and our command.</i>

642
01:24:46,481 --> 01:24:48,813
<i>The days pass, always the same.</i>

643
01:24:49,951 --> 01:24:51,942
<i>We don't know what will happen to us.</i>

644
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:55,182
<i>We've become rocks, boulders...</i>

645
01:24:56,124 --> 01:24:58,024
<i>immobile, hard.</i>

646
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:03,522
<i>Fear no longer exists,</i>
<i>because life no longer exists.</i>

647
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:07,797
<i>We know we can't win.</i>

648
01:25:08,870 --> 01:25:12,306
<i>We're alone, in the middle of the desert.</i>

649
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:15,105
<i>Alone with our sins.</i>

650
01:25:16,911 --> 01:25:21,177
<i>It's all one great light</i>
<i>with no dimensions, no size.</i>

651
01:25:22,917 --> 01:25:25,852
<i>It's all a blinding light...</i>

652
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:29,484
<i>immense, infinite.</i>

653
01:25:40,535 --> 01:25:44,096
The British broke through up north,
the Ariete Division was destroyed.

654
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:45,903
And the Germans?

655
01:25:46,774 --> 01:25:49,299
They lost almost all
of their Armored Divisions.

656
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:52,838
Rommel decided to retreat,
he wants to save the Afrika Korps.

657
01:25:54,149 --> 01:25:56,515
What are our orders? What'll we do?

658
01:25:56,784 --> 01:25:59,753
Disengage and establish
a new line of defense...

659
01:26:00,622 --> 01:26:03,090
30 kilometers from here, at Qaret el Khadim.

660
01:26:03,358 --> 01:26:04,848
-The Folgore Division, too?
-No.

661
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:09,055
We're at Gebel Kalakh.
They stationed us as rearguards.

662
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:14,033
Let's hope for the best. They say
"disengagement" but they mean "retreat."

663
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:16,595
Maybe we'll get our hides home safely.

664
01:26:17,472 --> 01:26:18,871
Are they sending trucks?

665
01:26:19,407 --> 01:26:22,274
No, there are none.

666
01:26:23,311 --> 01:26:24,801
We'll have to make do.

667
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:29,416
May God help us.

668
01:27:48,229 --> 01:27:49,924
Look! The Germans!

669
01:27:56,537 --> 01:27:57,663
Stop!

670
01:28:15,056 --> 01:28:17,354
Italians, you'll die here!

671
01:28:20,194 --> 01:28:21,627
Damn Germans!

672
01:28:36,744 --> 01:28:37,733
Italians!

673
01:28:52,226 --> 01:28:54,786
Stop. Stop, for God's sake!

674
01:28:57,265 --> 01:28:59,495
Not even the Holy Spirit could fit in here!

675
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:02,627
-There's plenty of room!
-We're full!

676
01:29:04,472 --> 01:29:06,337
Let us in!

677
01:29:08,576 --> 01:29:09,565
Son of a bitch!

678
01:29:55,957 --> 01:29:59,723
General. Lt. Fiore, 27th Pavia Infantry...

679
01:29:59,894 --> 01:30:00,918
at your orders.

680
01:30:02,196 --> 01:30:03,458
At ease.

681
01:30:05,099 --> 01:30:06,657
Can we be of help?

682
01:30:07,068 --> 01:30:09,093
No, I don't need anything.

683
01:30:09,170 --> 01:30:10,364
We can dig.

684
01:30:12,740 --> 01:30:16,369
He was my orderly for 15 years,
I want to bury him myself.

685
01:30:18,079 --> 01:30:20,741
-You're not wounded?
-No.

686
01:30:23,017 --> 01:30:25,110
We're retreating to Qaret el Khadim.

687
01:30:25,586 --> 01:30:29,078
Want us to send a vehicle for you?

688
01:30:30,391 --> 01:30:31,722
Thank you.

689
01:30:32,326 --> 01:30:36,092
Take cover with your men,
don't worry about me.

690
01:30:37,398 --> 01:30:38,660
Yes, sir.

691
01:30:40,368 --> 01:30:43,132
Whom did I have the honor of speaking to?

692
01:30:45,473 --> 01:30:48,909
It doesn't matter anymore.

693
01:30:50,311 --> 01:30:51,676
Good luck.

694
01:30:52,747 --> 01:30:54,044
Thanks, Your Excellency.

695
01:32:42,456 --> 01:32:45,721
I want my shoe back!

696
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:52,130
Here it is!

697
01:32:54,702 --> 01:32:57,000
It's all over, you can go home.

698
01:32:57,371 --> 01:32:59,362
You're going home.

699
01:33:35,876 --> 01:33:37,468
Good evening, Lieutenant.

700
01:33:38,312 --> 01:33:39,779
Where are you going?

701
01:33:41,749 --> 01:33:43,376
To Qaret el Khadim.

702
01:33:43,884 --> 01:33:45,078
This is it.

703
01:33:46,053 --> 01:33:47,486
Where's command?

704
01:33:47,555 --> 01:33:50,820
There isn't one, it's a hospital.

705
01:33:52,293 --> 01:33:53,988
They told us to come here.

706
01:33:54,261 --> 01:33:58,197
The British are everywhere,
we've been ordered to retreat to Fuka.

707
01:34:02,503 --> 01:34:03,800
How will we get to Fuka?

708
01:34:03,971 --> 01:34:05,165
That truck is leaving soon.

709
01:34:05,239 --> 01:34:08,174
Get on and leave the injured behind.

710
01:34:09,377 --> 01:34:12,244
-What will you do?
-I'm staying here.

711
01:34:13,047 --> 01:34:16,574
We're waiting for the British.
They'll take better care of them.

712
01:34:17,385 --> 01:34:18,443
Good luck.

713
01:34:39,006 --> 01:34:40,940
-Tarozzi!
-Hello, Serra.

714
01:34:42,209 --> 01:34:43,574
Lieutenant.

715
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:46,577
How are you?

716
01:34:50,317 --> 01:34:51,409
Here's how I am.

717
01:35:36,330 --> 01:35:37,319
Stop!

718
01:35:51,512 --> 01:35:53,980
Calm down, there's a shelter!

719
01:35:54,048 --> 01:35:56,380
There it is. We're there.

720
01:36:13,434 --> 01:36:15,231
Stop, you can't enter!

721
01:36:16,170 --> 01:36:18,297
They're shooting, we've got injured men.

722
01:36:18,372 --> 01:36:20,840
You can't go in! Understand?

723
01:36:20,908 --> 01:36:24,867
You don't understand,
we won't stay out in this bullet storm.

724
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:41,784
-Look!
-What a mess!

725
01:37:45,392 --> 01:37:46,552
Christ!

726
01:37:50,698 --> 01:37:52,825
-Lieutenant?
-Yes, sir.

727
01:37:53,267 --> 01:37:54,564
Where are you going?

728
01:37:55,236 --> 01:37:58,501
Retreating to Fuka,
taking the injured to the hospital.

729
01:37:58,572 --> 01:38:01,473
Good. Make sure they get better soon...

730
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:03,902
and go back to the front line
as soon as possible.

731
01:38:04,945 --> 01:38:07,072
Aren't we retreating?

732
01:38:07,548 --> 01:38:10,312
This is an active war, sometimes
we go forward, sometimes we go back.

733
01:38:11,018 --> 01:38:13,248
It's a strategic retreat, temporary.

734
01:38:14,088 --> 01:38:15,646
Reinforcements are arriving.

735
01:38:21,528 --> 01:38:22,517
Colonel!

736
01:38:23,631 --> 01:38:26,600
We don't have a vehicle.
Will you send one for the injured men?

737
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:28,199
Sure, will do.

738
01:38:29,203 --> 01:38:31,797
An Italian soldier never loses hope.

739
01:38:31,906 --> 01:38:34,739
If he's willing, he'll always find a way.

740
01:38:37,044 --> 01:38:38,136
Shall we go?

741
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:27,406
Stop!

742
01:41:27,948 --> 01:41:30,781
We've come from Qaret el Khadim.
They told us to go to Fuka.

743
01:41:30,851 --> 01:41:32,443
The British are in Fuka.

744
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:36,211
The 10th Army Corps
should gather at Marsa Matruh.

745
01:41:36,857 --> 01:41:39,985
But that's 100 kilometers away!

746
01:41:40,761 --> 01:41:42,956
We don't have a vehicle,
we've got injured men.

747
01:41:43,030 --> 01:41:46,193
Those are the orders.
I'll go look for the rest of the column.

748
01:42:18,031 --> 01:42:19,828
<i>We proceed haphazardly.</i>

749
01:42:20,334 --> 01:42:22,131
<i>Commands and countermands.</i>

750
01:42:22,569 --> 01:42:25,970
<i>No one knows what's happening,</i>
<i>what to do.</i>

751
01:42:29,176 --> 01:42:31,576
<i>We wander through the desert</i>
<i>fending for ourselves.</i>

752
01:42:32,412 --> 01:42:34,880
<i>We can only hope something will happen...</i>

753
01:42:35,849 --> 01:42:38,613
<i>anything that will put an end...</i>

754
01:42:38,685 --> 01:42:41,210
<i>to the humiliation of this endless end.</i>

755
01:42:53,500 --> 01:42:55,229
Lieutenant, how's the wound?

756
01:42:57,337 --> 01:42:58,429
Fine.

757
01:43:01,909 --> 01:43:03,001
Want to eat something?

758
01:43:04,545 --> 01:43:06,274
We have some extra canned goods.

759
01:43:07,447 --> 01:43:08,471
No, thanks.

760
01:43:13,053 --> 01:43:14,111
Serra.

761
01:43:23,597 --> 01:43:26,327
-It's the last one?
-Eat.

762
01:43:32,472 --> 01:43:34,838
I don't sleep near corpses. It's not right.

763
01:43:38,679 --> 01:43:39,907
It's not right.

764
01:43:42,983 --> 01:43:44,416
This is a cemetery.

765
01:44:35,035 --> 01:44:38,630
Will we make it back home?

766
01:44:44,444 --> 01:44:45,934
We'll make it.

767
01:45:48,008 --> 01:45:52,342
<i>Italian soldiers,</i>
<i>command has abandoned you.</i>

768
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:55,978
<i>The war is over for you, surrender!</i>

769
01:45:56,049 --> 01:45:57,778
<i>Put down your weapons.</i>

770
01:45:58,418 --> 01:46:00,409
<i>Don't resist.</i>

771
01:47:39,853 --> 01:47:40,877
Lieutenant!

772
01:47:45,525 --> 01:47:46,583
I'll help you.

773
01:47:56,903 --> 01:47:59,963
Look! Maybe they're ours.

774
01:49:04,704 --> 01:49:05,864
Start.

775
01:49:10,210 --> 01:49:11,234
Start!

776
01:49:30,931 --> 01:49:33,866
Lieutenant, there's water.

777
01:49:41,341 --> 01:49:42,865
Seems to work.

778
01:49:46,279 --> 01:49:47,576
There's gasoline!

779
01:49:51,318 --> 01:49:53,912
Sergeant, help me pull it out!

780
01:50:15,141 --> 01:50:16,699
It won't start.

781
01:50:22,215 --> 01:50:24,080
-Start!
-It's pointless.

782
01:50:26,953 --> 01:50:27,942
Start!

783
01:50:52,812 --> 01:50:55,975
It started! I told you so!

784
01:50:56,549 --> 01:50:59,848
-Maybe we'll make it.
-We won't make it.

785
01:51:01,855 --> 01:51:03,117
I won't make it.

786
01:51:05,625 --> 01:51:06,785
You go.

787
01:51:08,361 --> 01:51:12,354
Find a vehicle and come back for me.
I'll wait here.

788
01:51:13,667 --> 01:51:16,192
Sergeant, let's go!

789
01:51:17,137 --> 01:51:18,229
I'll help you.

790
01:51:20,707 --> 01:51:22,140
Get on that bike.

791
01:51:24,544 --> 01:51:26,136
Get on that bike.

792
01:51:42,328 --> 01:51:43,386
I'll stay here.

793
01:51:44,898 --> 01:51:46,798
The Lieutenant can't stand up.
You go without me.

794
01:51:47,400 --> 01:51:50,028
I won't leave you here. Let's try, Lieutenant!

795
01:51:51,738 --> 01:51:54,866
Too much sand,
we won't even move two meters. Go.

796
01:51:55,241 --> 01:51:57,641
Let's try anyway!
We've got to get out of here.

797
01:51:57,711 --> 01:52:01,772
You have more chance alone,
to find the column, a trail.

798
01:52:01,848 --> 01:52:03,338
We have to go!

799
01:52:05,952 --> 01:52:06,941
Go.

800
01:52:10,890 --> 01:52:13,017
Fine, but I'll come back.

801
01:52:14,060 --> 01:52:15,186
I swear!

802
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:18,688
I know you will.

803
01:52:20,333 --> 01:52:24,463
Lieutenant, hold on.
I'll get a vehicle and come back!

804
01:53:38,645 --> 01:53:43,548
The battle of El Alamein was fought
from October 23 to November 4, 1942.

805
01:53:46,352 --> 01:53:49,844
104,000 men of the Italian and German Army

806
01:53:49,923 --> 01:53:53,381
faced 195,000 men of the 8th British Army.

807
01:53:55,261 --> 01:53:57,627
The Italians and Germans suffered

808
01:53:57,697 --> 01:54:00,996
9,000 dead and 15,000 wounded,
and 35,000 prisoners.

809
01:54:01,067 --> 01:54:04,264
The British suffered 4,600 dead
and 8,500 wounded.

810
01:54:05,939 --> 01:54:07,804
The 10th Italian Army Corps,

811
01:54:07,874 --> 01:54:10,900
