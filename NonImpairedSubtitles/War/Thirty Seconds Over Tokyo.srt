1
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:54,429
Yes? Just a minute. Your call, Colonel.

2
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:56,028
Thank you.

3
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,268
Hello. Captain York, please.

4
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:03,005
You know, if this thing works out,

5
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,671
it might give our boys all the way
from Bataan to Singapore a big lift.

6
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:10,577
And it may pull a lot of
Japs back to their islands.

7
00:02:10,647 --> 00:02:13,582
- It'll work out, General.
- I'm sure it will.

8
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,182
Hello. Hello, York? Doolittle.

9
00:02:17,787 --> 00:02:21,416
York, I want you to get 24
B-25s with volunteer crews

10
00:02:21,491 --> 00:02:24,187
down to Eglin Field as soon as you can.

11
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:28,224
The job will take them out of the
country for about three months.

12
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:30,198
Tell them it's a secret mission.

13
00:02:30,266 --> 00:02:33,167
They won't know where they're
going until they get there.

14
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,261
That's right, volunteers.

15
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:39,735
Tell them they're not to talk
to anybody. That's an order.

16
00:02:40,343 --> 00:02:42,470
I'll join you in a few days. Right.

17
00:02:48,484 --> 00:02:50,509
Zero-two-two-four-one
to Eglin Tower.

18
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,055
Three B-25s request traffic
and landing instructions.

19
00:02:53,122 --> 00:02:54,180
Go ahead.

20
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,225
<i>Army four-one. The
left-hand pattern.</i>

21
00:02:56,292 --> 00:02:58,226
<i>Wind direction north by northeast.</i>

22
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:00,455
<i>Land on runway number three.</i>

23
00:03:01,097 --> 00:03:02,462
There's the field all right.

24
00:03:02,532 --> 00:03:05,023
Boy, did you ever see such a wide runway?

25
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:06,090
She's big all right.

26
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:07,727
You could almost close your eyes and get in.

27
00:03:07,804 --> 00:03:09,863
And I'd give plenty to
know where we go from here.

28
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,031
Yeah, so would I.

29
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:14,008
Hey, don't do anything till I get my camera.

30
00:03:15,311 --> 00:03:17,279
How does she look from the nose, Clever?

31
00:03:17,347 --> 00:03:22,444
Great. Florida, palm trees,
alligators, bathing beauties.

32
00:03:22,919 --> 00:03:26,013
Hey, Thatcher, have a
look at some real country.

33
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:28,523
It's not as pretty as Billings, sir.

34
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:30,559
Did you keep the cookies this trip, Thatcher?

35
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:35,121
Yes, sir. I had a little trouble coming
over the mountains, but I hung on.

36
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:37,626
<i>- Zero-two-two-four-one to
flight. - Hey, wait a minute.</i>

37
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,497
We'll go around, make an echelon right

38
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:43,266
<i>once over the field, then break
away. Let's make it pretty.</i>

39
00:03:44,207 --> 00:03:45,799
Here's for luck.

40
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,500
Switch is off!

41
00:04:26,549 --> 00:04:30,076
- 5:25. Not bad time.
- Yeah, we moved.

42
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:32,553
Better write that left engine
up. She sounded a little rough.

43
00:04:32,622 --> 00:04:34,419
Boy, I got some swell shots, Lawson.

44
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:37,550
You really made a nice break away.
Gave me kind of an artistic angle.

45
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,925
Some day I'll do a crash landing
so you can get a real movie.

46
00:04:39,996 --> 00:04:42,521
Thatcher says that Florida
can't compare to Billings.

47
00:04:42,598 --> 00:04:45,192
Trouble with Thatcher is he thinks
that any place with more than 300 people

48
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:47,532
- is overcrowded.
- Oh, according to the last census, sir,

49
00:04:47,603 --> 00:04:50,697
Billings has a population of 16,380.

50
00:04:50,773 --> 00:04:54,732
16,000! Oh, no, Thatcher, you must
be thinking of Greater Billings.

51
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:58,542
No, he's right, Clever. They
count the cows up in that country.

52
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,808
- Sorry, sir.
- Yes.

53
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:03,715
- Cameras aren't allowed on the field.
- What?

54
00:05:03,786 --> 00:05:04,912
That's right, sir.

55
00:05:04,988 --> 00:05:08,219
A lot of secret work goes on here,
and they're very strict about it.

56
00:05:08,291 --> 00:05:09,986
Well, I can't see anything secret from here.

57
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:11,924
Then I'll have to report you
to the Commanding Officer, sir.

58
00:05:11,995 --> 00:05:13,189
Those are my orders.

59
00:05:13,262 --> 00:05:14,820
Okay. Okay.

60
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:17,764
Hey, look, Brick Holstrom's still with us.

61
00:05:17,834 --> 00:05:20,166
We were afraid you wouldn't get
that turkey in till tomorrow.

62
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:21,567
Why, that baby flies so pretty

63
00:05:21,637 --> 00:05:23,901
we floated the last 200 miles.

64
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:26,737
- Are you guys ready?
- Yeah. Come on, Brick.

65
00:05:26,809 --> 00:05:29,505
Oh, Thatcher, I'll be right back
and tell you where your quarters are.

66
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:30,841
Yes, sir.

67
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:33,612
Come on, Davey, you've got
an idea. What's the dope?

68
00:05:33,683 --> 00:05:36,049
- Where do we go from here?
- I already told you.

69
00:05:36,119 --> 00:05:38,349
All they said was that it'd
take us out of the country,

70
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,787
we'd be gone about three months
and that it'd be dangerous.

71
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:43,621
Look, I got the real dope from Joe Randall.

72
00:05:43,726 --> 00:05:46,524
He says they're forming patrol
squadrons to guard the Canal.

73
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:49,087
What's dangerous about Canal patrol?

74
00:05:49,165 --> 00:05:50,462
Well, what are we worrying about?

75
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:53,058
Ski will give us all the
dope when we check in anyhow.

76
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,607
Three ships in, sir.
Holstrom, Lawson, and myself.

77
00:05:58,674 --> 00:06:01,074
- Good. Your ships okay?
- Yes, sir.

78
00:06:01,144 --> 00:06:02,406
Sit down.

79
00:06:03,212 --> 00:06:04,804
Where we staying, Ski?

80
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:06,576
The government's leased a hotel near here.

81
00:06:06,649 --> 00:06:08,549
They call it the Officers' Club.

82
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,882
The men whose wives are
coming can stay there.

83
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:13,080
The other officers'
quarters are in Barracks 5.

84
00:06:13,156 --> 00:06:14,248
Is Emmy coming down?

85
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,787
- She'll be here in a couple of days.
- Where'll I put Thatcher, Ski?

86
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,919
The enlisted men are assigned to Barracks 12.

87
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:21,355
Okay.

88
00:06:22,732 --> 00:06:24,427
- Anything else?
- Nope?

89
00:06:25,168 --> 00:06:27,033
At least, not until tomorrow morning.

90
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:30,034
Well, we'll be seeing you.

91
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:38,910
Say, Ski, the guys are all
crazy to know what's up.

92
00:06:39,015 --> 00:06:40,983
You know as much about it as I do.

93
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:43,917
We may be given more
information in the morning.

94
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:02,836
Well, beat me, daddy! Look who's coming!

95
00:07:02,905 --> 00:07:05,931
Well, well, well, plant
me now and dig me later,

96
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,636
if it isn't the pride of
Randolph Field. How are you, boy?

97
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:10,702
Great, Shorty. The minute
we heard that razzmatazz,

98
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:12,577
we knew you must be somewhere around.

99
00:07:12,648 --> 00:07:14,946
- You volunteer for this deal, too?
- Sure enough.

100
00:07:15,017 --> 00:07:18,783
They had me stationed up in Minneapolis.
Coldest country I ever did see.

101
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:21,653
I'd have volunteered for anything
to get back in the sunshine.

102
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:24,454
- Where you been?
- Columbia, South Carolina.

103
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,084
- Bob!
- Hello, Ted.

104
00:07:26,162 --> 00:07:27,390
You guys know each other?

105
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:29,260
Oh, we just went through
Kelly together, that's all.

106
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:32,028
- Sure. Bob was bridesmaid at my wedding.
- Wedding?

107
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:34,069
Nobody tells me anything anymore.

108
00:07:34,137 --> 00:07:36,264
How long you been balled up and chained down?

109
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:38,739
Six months, in five more days.

110
00:07:38,808 --> 00:07:41,709
Well, blow my foot off. Skin me again, boy.

111
00:07:41,777 --> 00:07:43,404
Hey, Davey, what are you doing down here?

112
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:45,071
- Brick!
- Hi, Don.

113
00:07:45,148 --> 00:07:48,015
- I thought you were hunting subs.
- Was. Got me one, too.

114
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:50,109
- You in on this deal?
- Sure. I've got a swell crew

115
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:53,212
and it looked like it was going
to be something, so why not?

116
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:57,624
- Any ideas what we might be up to?
- Oh, just a hunch.

117
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,521
Yeah? Well, give.

118
00:07:59,962 --> 00:08:03,159
South Seas. Knock ourselves
off a few meatballs.

119
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,659
Yeah?

120
00:08:18,981 --> 00:08:20,141
Three.

121
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:23,651
Honest man. Dealer takes two.

122
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,645
- You know, I just got an idea.
- About what?

123
00:08:26,722 --> 00:08:28,553
About where we might be going.

124
00:08:28,624 --> 00:08:32,151
The way it looks to... No,
that's not right. Forget it.

125
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:33,690
Says two.

126
00:08:33,863 --> 00:08:36,491
- You know, I've got an idea too.
- Yeah?

127
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:38,700
I've got an idea you're pretty much of a dope

128
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:41,032
to have come in on this
deal in the first place.

129
00:08:41,103 --> 00:08:43,298
What kind of a crack is that?

130
00:08:43,639 --> 00:08:47,268
Oh, I don't know. You're
married. You've got a swell girl.

131
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,377
I never would have stuck my
neck out if I were in your boots.

132
00:08:50,446 --> 00:08:52,243
Go away. You say two?

133
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,181
And up two.

134
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,610
Those guys are off again.

135
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,857
Hey, stand up there.
Who do you think you are?

136
00:09:10,866 --> 00:09:14,700
Have you ever carried a navigator
in your ship before, Spike?

137
00:09:15,004 --> 00:09:17,598
Neither have I, until I
volunteered for this job.

138
00:09:17,673 --> 00:09:20,767
Oh, we're going to see some fancy stuff,
all right. I kind of got a feeling.

139
00:09:20,843 --> 00:09:22,310
Shoot me for a pole cat.

140
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:25,472
Do I see two red-blooded
citizens lying on their backsides

141
00:09:25,548 --> 00:09:27,539
while the Texas anthem is being rendered?

142
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:29,380
On your feet, men.

143
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:31,778
What are you beefing about,
Shorty? You're from Virginia.

144
00:09:31,854 --> 00:09:33,151
That's right, sharp cat,

145
00:09:33,222 --> 00:09:36,123
but my pal here, he's from
Texas, and he takes offense easy.

146
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:38,922
- Hello, Joe.
- Hello, Joyce. I've got some news.

147
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:40,860
Hey, you guys, shut up!

148
00:09:41,764 --> 00:09:44,289
Quiet, fellows. Listen.
Jimmy Doolittle's down here

149
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,034
and he's a Lieutenant Colonel now.

150
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:50,766
Jimmy Doolittle! A southern
boy from Southern California.

151
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:54,435
<i>Let's have Eyes of Texas for
Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle.</i>

152
00:09:58,981 --> 00:10:00,448
Attention!

153
00:10:02,485 --> 00:10:05,181
Gentlemen, Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle.

154
00:10:06,489 --> 00:10:07,888
As you were.

155
00:10:16,499 --> 00:10:19,525
You men are here because you've volunteered.

156
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:22,503
You have been told it's a dangerous mission.

157
00:10:22,571 --> 00:10:26,598
I can't tell you any more than that
now, but I want to emphasize the danger.

158
00:10:28,311 --> 00:10:31,542
The most important thing
at the moment is secrecy.

159
00:10:31,781 --> 00:10:35,740
I don't want you to even tell
your wives what you see down here.

160
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:37,785
And if you think you've
guessed where you're going,

161
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:40,219
you're probably wrong. But
don't even talk about your guess.

162
00:10:40,289 --> 00:10:42,587
If the slightest word about
this mission gets around,

163
00:10:42,658 --> 00:10:47,652
you will endanger not only your own lives,
but the lives of thousands of other men.

164
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:51,264
Now I want to ask you a question.

165
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,870
Has anybody tried to talk to you about this?

166
00:10:56,038 --> 00:10:58,802
Good. If anybody on the
field or off the field

167
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:00,569
tries to engage you in conversation

168
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:03,510
as to why you're here,
no matter how innocently,

169
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:05,103
I want you to get his name and give it to me

170
00:11:05,181 --> 00:11:07,547
and I'll turn it over to the FBI.

171
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:18,792
This is going to be the toughest
training you've ever had.

172
00:11:20,162 --> 00:11:24,292
You will have the same crew all
the way through and the same ship.

173
00:11:25,901 --> 00:11:29,200
And the man or the ship
that fails will be dropped.

174
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:34,333
You're going to do things with a
B-25 you thought were impossible.

175
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:38,635
Now, if any of you have any doubts,
I'd like you to drop out right now

176
00:11:38,714 --> 00:11:41,706
and I promise you that no one
will ever think the worse of you.

177
00:11:41,784 --> 00:11:44,116
If you have wives or children
or any other considerations

178
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:47,485
that might get on your nerves in
a crisis, it's perfectly all right.

179
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:50,650
As a matter of fact, it's
your duty to drop out.

180
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:58,093
Very well. We'll have these talks
as often as possible. That's all.

181
00:12:01,337 --> 00:12:03,703
We're going up this morning
for an orientation flight.

182
00:12:03,773 --> 00:12:08,301
There are four auxiliary
fields. One, two, three, four.

183
00:12:09,412 --> 00:12:11,812
Line them up and locate them all.

184
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,043
We don't know which we're going to
use for our confidential experiments,

185
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:18,052
so familiarize yourselves with all of them.

186
00:12:18,387 --> 00:12:20,321
Look over the countryside,
and we'll meet here again

187
00:12:20,389 --> 00:12:23,483
at 3:30 this afternoon.
Are there any questions?

188
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,652
Sir, the plugs are being
changed in my engines.

189
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:30,062
To save time, may I go along in Jones' ship?

190
00:12:30,132 --> 00:12:33,431
Right, Smith. All right.
You can go to your ship now.

191
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:36,966
It looks to me like it's
going to be a long time

192
00:12:37,039 --> 00:12:39,405
before you swing down Main Street
of Billings again, Thatcher.

193
00:12:39,475 --> 00:12:42,171
In Billings, sir, the main
street is Minnesota Avenue.

194
00:12:44,647 --> 00:12:46,308
You know, that guy really means business.

195
00:12:46,382 --> 00:12:49,317
- He had me sweating a little.
- Yeah, me too.

196
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,046
- Lieutenant Lawson?
- Yes.

197
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,554
Someone to see you out in front
of the PX at J Street, sir.

198
00:12:53,622 --> 00:12:56,284
Thanks. I wonder who would...

199
00:12:57,059 --> 00:12:58,788
I'll be right back.

200
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:04,359
Ellen!

201
00:13:08,471 --> 00:13:10,996
- Where did you come from?
- I drove to Carolina to surprise you.

202
00:13:11,073 --> 00:13:15,476
- And then they told me you're down here.
- Well, how are you?

203
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:17,876
I'm just fine, thank you.
And how are you bearing up?

204
00:13:17,947 --> 00:13:20,245
Oh, great. You look just the same.

205
00:13:20,316 --> 00:13:24,047
Well, of course I do. You can't
expect any change this soon.

206
00:13:25,354 --> 00:13:26,912
- What's the joke?
- Nothing.

207
00:13:26,989 --> 00:13:28,354
Except you're so funny.

208
00:13:28,424 --> 00:13:30,324
Tell me, honey, were you surprised?

209
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:34,192
Oh, I couldn't believe my eyes.
Here, let me buy you a drink.

210
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:36,293
Gee, I'm glad to see you.

211
00:13:48,611 --> 00:13:50,841
Come on, let's go around here.

212
00:14:06,362 --> 00:14:08,728
Tell me, honey, how come you're so cute?

213
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:12,631
I had to be if I were going to
get such a good looking fellow.

214
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,631
You know, there's a lot of things
I want to talk over with you.

215
00:14:16,705 --> 00:14:20,266
Go ahead. Were you really surprised?

216
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,142
Well, no, not exactly.

217
00:14:23,712 --> 00:14:26,237
You know, you go into something
like this with your eyes open.

218
00:14:26,315 --> 00:14:29,580
- Naturally you've got to take your chances.
- I see.

219
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:33,245
Isn't that kind of a
cold-blooded way to look at it?

220
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:36,189
Oh, now, don't get mad. You've
got to be cold-blooded about it.

221
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:38,453
This is the most important
thing that's ever happened to me.

222
00:14:38,527 --> 00:14:40,495
- What about me?
- Well, you're in on it, too.

223
00:14:40,563 --> 00:14:44,397
- That's why I want to talk it over.
- That's very generous. Go on, Ted.

224
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,798
Well, in the first place,
we've got to keep it a secret.

225
00:14:46,869 --> 00:14:50,066
- I don't want you to tell a soul.
- You're not, I mean, you...

226
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,868
You don't wish it hadn't happened, do you?

227
00:14:51,941 --> 00:14:53,238
Oh, no, of course not.

228
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:55,573
But it's a military
secret, I've got my orders.

229
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:58,408
Military... Say, what are you talking about?

230
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,040
Well, this job I volunteered
for. Didn't you get my letter?

231
00:15:01,116 --> 00:15:04,347
- No. Didn't you get mine?
- No.

232
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,880
Well, I suppose it's very funny, but...

233
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:10,357
- Hey, Lawson! Ted Lawson!
- Here.

234
00:15:10,426 --> 00:15:12,291
What are you hiding out...

235
00:15:12,361 --> 00:15:15,694
- Ellen, when did you get here?
- Five minutes ago. How's my bridesmaid?

236
00:15:15,764 --> 00:15:18,164
Great. Only I'm going
to have to break this up.

237
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,599
Doolittle came out to watch us take off.

238
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,229
Okay. I'll see you for dinner.

239
00:15:23,305 --> 00:15:25,637
There's a hotel about a mile
and a half down the road.

240
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:29,200
I haven't seen it yet, but
they tell me you can't miss it.

241
00:15:29,278 --> 00:15:32,770
- I'll find it.
- I'm sorry to have to rush off like this.

242
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:41,786
Don't forget dinner.

243
00:15:54,637 --> 00:15:57,435
Say, did anybody pick up a letter for me?

244
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:02,473
Yes, sir. I did this morning.
I forgot all about it.

245
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:04,873
<i>- Well, bring it up.
- Yes, sir.</i>

246
00:16:19,528 --> 00:16:20,654
I'm sorry, sir.

247
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:22,890
Okay. Thanks. Take over, will you, Davenport.

248
00:16:22,965 --> 00:16:24,091
Sure.

249
00:16:32,307 --> 00:16:35,470
Hey! I'm going to have a baby!

250
00:16:35,544 --> 00:16:36,533
Hey, it's from Ellen.

251
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:40,070
She's going to be... I mean,
I'm going to be a father.

252
00:17:26,361 --> 00:17:27,828
Hello, flyer.

253
00:17:29,765 --> 00:17:31,392
Oh, I'm sorry I woke you up.

254
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:35,665
I wasn't sleeping, really. I
was just dozing and thinking.

255
00:17:36,105 --> 00:17:40,439
I'm sorry I didn't get back for
dinner. We had a lot of checking to do.

256
00:17:41,944 --> 00:17:45,004
You must've thought I was
an awful dope this morning.

257
00:17:45,948 --> 00:17:49,315
But I didn't get your letter
until later, so I didn't know.

258
00:17:49,384 --> 00:17:51,579
I know. Sit down.

259
00:18:00,763 --> 00:18:05,496
- I think it's swell about the baby.
- I knew you would. I wasn't a bit worried.

260
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:08,528
You know, it's going to seem funny.

261
00:18:08,604 --> 00:18:12,165
I don't care whether it's a
boy or a girl. Not that much.

262
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:15,668
I just want you to be
okay. It's pretty serious.

263
00:18:17,146 --> 00:18:20,115
- Well, what's so funny?
- I was just thinking.

264
00:18:21,216 --> 00:18:25,016
Here you're getting ready to go
off on something really tough,

265
00:18:25,721 --> 00:18:27,348
and you're worrying about me.

266
00:18:29,558 --> 00:18:32,823
If I were in your spot,
I'd be scared to death.

267
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:37,063
- But I guess I am anyhow.
- Purely routine stuff, flyer.

268
00:18:37,132 --> 00:18:41,193
The kind of job every girl takes
on once or twice in her life.

269
00:18:42,471 --> 00:18:44,371
Why don't you lie down?

270
00:18:53,849 --> 00:18:55,476
You know, Ellen,

271
00:18:56,084 --> 00:18:58,211
I'm kind of glad I got you.

272
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:02,081
I guess that's what I was
thinking about in my sleep.

273
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:04,348
It almost frightened me.

274
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:07,987
It seemed that I was thinking,
"What if I'd never met him?"

275
00:19:10,165 --> 00:19:11,325
Well, for one thing

276
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,992
you wouldn't be traipsing around the country

277
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:15,730
from one airfield to another
trying to catch up with me.

278
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:18,532
And for another,

279
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,174
you wouldn't be having a baby
right in the middle of a war.

280
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,211
Oh, no, it wasn't that.

281
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:25,337
I was thinking that if I hadn't met you,

282
00:19:26,215 --> 00:19:30,914
I'd never have felt really close
to anybody, never in my whole life.

283
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:38,388
Married six months and
together less than two weeks.

284
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,894
That's not being as close as I'd figured on.

285
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:43,431
Don't you see, Ted, that's just it.

286
00:19:43,532 --> 00:19:47,366
If people can be close when
they're far away from each other,

287
00:19:47,736 --> 00:19:50,034
well, that's what it should be.

288
00:19:50,138 --> 00:19:52,368
Yeah, yeah, I guess so.

289
00:19:54,076 --> 00:19:55,407
Cuddle me.

290
00:20:01,149 --> 00:20:03,515
I was thinking about last Christmas.

291
00:20:03,585 --> 00:20:06,281
The tree we set up in
that Portland auto court.

292
00:20:06,355 --> 00:20:08,880
- Wasn't it an awful little room?
- Yeah.

293
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:11,517
And the Christmas dinner we were planning on.

294
00:20:11,593 --> 00:20:15,324
And then you ran out of gas and
landed in the mud up in lllwaco,

295
00:20:15,397 --> 00:20:19,390
Christmas Eve and Christmas were
all over before I saw you again.

296
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:23,631
Yeah, that was tough. But I
got a scarf out of it, anyhow.

297
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:26,330
Well, it wasn't exactly as we'd planned it.

298
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:29,605
It was our first Christmas,
and somewhere way off,

299
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,472
it didn't matter where,

300
00:20:31,546 --> 00:20:36,347
I knew I had you. Oh, Ted, it was
the nicest Christmas of my life.

301
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:42,987
You were born to marry a flyer, Ellen.
I knew that the minute I first saw you.

302
00:20:43,659 --> 00:20:45,718
As a matter of fact that's why I married you.

303
00:20:45,861 --> 00:20:48,887
- You know, I've got a confession to make.
- What?

304
00:20:48,964 --> 00:20:52,798
The truth is, you didn't
marry me. I married you.

305
00:20:53,869 --> 00:20:56,463
Oh, you did, eh?

306
00:20:56,905 --> 00:20:59,567
The first time I saw you
in the library at LACC,

307
00:20:59,641 --> 00:21:02,474
I said to myself, "Oh, oh, that's for me. "

308
00:21:02,778 --> 00:21:03,904
And from then on,

309
00:21:03,979 --> 00:21:07,380
clear up to the night we got the judge
out of bed in that little Idaho town,

310
00:21:07,449 --> 00:21:09,314
nothing was an accident, Ted.

311
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:11,750
I planned it that way.

312
00:21:12,154 --> 00:21:16,386
- You think you're pretty smart, don't you?
-  I'm not sure whether I do or not.

313
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,458
You see, you didn't put up much of a fight.

314
00:21:20,095 --> 00:21:22,723
I suppose you figured out on that baby, too?

315
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:26,598
That's something you'll never
know, flyer, you'll never know.

316
00:21:38,213 --> 00:21:40,773
Boys are working late these nights.

317
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:46,048
Yes. Do you have any idea
how long you'll be gone?

318
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,820
But as soon as this job is over,
I'm going to ask for a leave.

319
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,792
Two, maybe three weeks.

320
00:21:52,861 --> 00:21:55,125
We'll have that honeymoon
you're always talking about.

321
00:21:55,197 --> 00:21:57,427
Yes, just the three of us.

322
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:02,863
Ted.

323
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:08,807
I do hope I don't get big and
fat like that lady in Chicago.

324
00:22:14,216 --> 00:22:17,617
I want each one of you to know
something about the other man's job.

325
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:20,416
The pilots will practice
every job on the plane.

326
00:22:20,489 --> 00:22:23,856
Navigators will learn the work
of bombardiers and so forth.

327
00:22:23,992 --> 00:22:26,358
That's in case any of you get shot up.

328
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,362
There's one thing more.

329
00:22:28,530 --> 00:22:29,963
It is inevitable that some of your planes

330
00:22:30,032 --> 00:22:31,659
are going to fall into
the hands of the enemy.

331
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:35,134
For this reason, I have ordered
your Norden bombsights removed.

332
00:22:35,203 --> 00:22:39,606
Captain Greening has designed a sight
which will be perfect for our job.

333
00:22:40,042 --> 00:22:42,442
If there are no questions, I'll
ask Captain York to take over.

334
00:22:44,012 --> 00:22:46,674
Just like I said, we patrol off Brazil.

335
00:22:46,748 --> 00:22:49,239
Yeah, but what about taking
the Norden Bombsight out?

336
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:52,514
There's no chance of falling into the
hands of the enemy if you're hunting subs.

337
00:22:52,587 --> 00:22:56,717
- I hadn't thought of that.
- That Doolittle's a cheerful cuss, isn't he?

338
00:22:56,792 --> 00:23:00,523
"Just in case any of us are
shot up," a bundle of sunshine.

339
00:23:06,768 --> 00:23:08,668
Oh, it's Ted, it's Ted!

340
00:23:08,904 --> 00:23:11,532
George used to buzz me
when we were first married.

341
00:23:11,606 --> 00:23:14,575
He doesn't do it any more.
They're not supposed to.

342
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:17,803
- I wonder if he still loves me.
- I wouldn't worry about that.

343
00:23:17,879 --> 00:23:21,144
Every time Ski gets a new ship he
has a terrible love affair with it,

344
00:23:21,216 --> 00:23:22,774
but he always comes back to me,

345
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:24,375
especially when he's hungry.

346
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:27,286
Just think, they'll be gone three months.

347
00:23:27,355 --> 00:23:29,653
I think I'll get a job in a defense factory.

348
00:23:29,724 --> 00:23:32,921
I couldn't stand just sitting around
in some little apartment and waiting.

349
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:34,188
What are you going to do, Ellen?

350
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:37,527
Oh, I'm just going to sit
around and have a baby.

351
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:39,061
- A baby!
- A baby!

352
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:40,658
Ellen, why didn't you tell us?

353
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:43,898
I don't know. I guess I just
never thought of a way till now.

354
00:23:43,972 --> 00:23:46,532
As it turns out, it
wasn't hard to tell at all.

355
00:23:46,608 --> 00:23:48,701
Well, I'm going to have one, too.

356
00:23:48,777 --> 00:23:50,210
- What?
- Really?

357
00:23:50,312 --> 00:23:52,405
Gee, I think it's wonderful.

358
00:23:52,647 --> 00:23:56,083
George and I have talked about it,
but, well, with him away and all,

359
00:23:56,151 --> 00:23:59,245
- I guess I'm just too scared.
- I thought I would be too, but...

360
00:23:59,321 --> 00:24:01,915
Well, Ted and I figured that
everything since Pearl Harbor

361
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:03,981
has just been so much velvet.

362
00:24:04,059 --> 00:24:07,290
And then I guessed that if
anything should happen to him,

363
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,387
only I know nothing will,

364
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:13,696
I'd have the baby, and that would
be a little bit of Ted still living.

365
00:24:13,768 --> 00:24:16,635
I sometimes wonder how we'll
feel when it's all over.

366
00:24:16,705 --> 00:24:20,106
Just think, being able to settle
down in a little house somewhere

367
00:24:20,175 --> 00:24:23,542
and raise your children and
never be in doubt about anything.

368
00:24:23,612 --> 00:24:25,239
We'll probably have exactly the same doubts

369
00:24:25,313 --> 00:24:26,439
that we have right now.

370
00:24:26,515 --> 00:24:29,678
For example, will he or will
he not be home for dinner?

371
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:33,487
We're about to enter the most
secret part of our training.

372
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:37,889
This field is patrolled on all sides
so no one can disturb you at your work.

373
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:40,223
Gentlemen, this is
Lieutenant Miller of the Navy.

374
00:24:40,295 --> 00:24:42,559
He's going to instruct you in takeoffs.

375
00:24:42,631 --> 00:24:47,330
Instead of the normal B-25 takeoff
in 1,500 feet at 90 miles an hour,

376
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,801
he's going to show you how to do it

377
00:24:48,870 --> 00:24:52,931
with a full load of bombs and gas
in 500 feet at 50 miles an hour.

378
00:24:55,477 --> 00:24:57,274
You will attempt no short takeoffs

379
00:24:57,345 --> 00:25:00,178
from Eglin Field, where people can see you.

380
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:04,882
Lieutenant Miller will also give you
a few short talks on naval etiquette.

381
00:25:04,953 --> 00:25:07,353
Now, if this gives you any
hints as to your destination

382
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,084
or as to what kind of
work you're going to do,

383
00:25:10,158 --> 00:25:12,854
don't even discuss it among yourselves.

384
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:16,397
I'll ask Lieutenant Miller to take over now.

385
00:25:19,868 --> 00:25:21,233
Gentlemen,

386
00:25:21,303 --> 00:25:27,867
those flags out there are at
100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 feet

387
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:29,570
from the starting line.

388
00:25:29,644 --> 00:25:33,102
The line down the center of the
field is to guide you in your takeoff.

389
00:25:33,181 --> 00:25:37,015
The kind of work you're going to
do won't permit any deviations.

390
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:40,521
Now, the whole idea is to get up full
power before you release your brakes.

391
00:25:40,589 --> 00:25:43,683
Then start, at maximum r.
p. m., manifold pressure

392
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:46,025
and with your wing flaps all the way down.

393
00:25:46,094 --> 00:25:48,961
You'll have to rev your motors until
you think they're going to burn up.

394
00:25:49,030 --> 00:25:50,793
And then, when they reach the right pitch,

395
00:25:50,865 --> 00:25:53,834
and that's a matter of sound
and feel more than instruments,

396
00:25:53,902 --> 00:25:55,767
release your brakes and hunt for heaven.

397
00:25:55,837 --> 00:25:58,601
I don't expect any of you
to do it the first time.

398
00:25:58,673 --> 00:26:00,106
- Gray.
- Yes, sir.

399
00:26:00,175 --> 00:26:01,733
Suppose you and Manch try it first?

400
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,836
The rest of us will stay on the ground,
mark your takeoff and check the wind.

401
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:05,902
Yes, sir.

402
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,279
I think at first we can learn
as much by watching trial runs

403
00:26:08,350 --> 00:26:10,113
as by actually flying the ships.

404
00:26:10,185 --> 00:26:13,450
So let's all line up over
here and see how he does.

405
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:48,085
- What kind of surface wind, Ski?
- Eight miles an hour.

406
00:26:48,156 --> 00:26:51,148
He didn't have his engines revved up enough.

407
00:26:51,226 --> 00:26:53,023
Lawson, you go next.

408
00:26:53,094 --> 00:26:54,322
Now remember, for our purposes,

409
00:26:54,396 --> 00:26:56,455
if you get your wheels a foot off
the ground, that's good enough.

410
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,396
You don't need height, but
you've got to get your wheels off

411
00:26:58,466 --> 00:26:59,933
before you hit the last flag.

412
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:02,868
A little later we'll try retracting
the wheels at around 450 feet

413
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:04,564
and relying on your motors to float the ship.

414
00:27:04,639 --> 00:27:07,233
- Don't try that just yet, though.
- Right, sir.

415
00:27:07,309 --> 00:27:10,676
Now, grab the column and pull her until
you feel the inside of your backbone.

416
00:27:10,745 --> 00:27:12,042
Yes, sir.

417
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:31,764
Did you ever take off
a B-25 at 500 feet, sir?

418
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:34,766
No. But you men will. Don't worry about it.

419
00:27:34,836 --> 00:27:36,133
Watch Lawson there.

420
00:27:36,204 --> 00:27:40,368
You'll have to rev your motors at
least that high and maybe higher.

421
00:27:52,487 --> 00:27:57,652
About 700 feet. He burned his tailskid.
Didn't pull his wheels up soon enough.

422
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:13,239
Brother, that takeoff
was strictly on the cob.

423
00:28:13,308 --> 00:28:17,005
That airplane of yours looked
exactly like a ruptured duck.

424
00:28:17,078 --> 00:28:18,477
How do you like this guy?

425
00:28:18,546 --> 00:28:20,946
He takes off like an old lady in a high wind,

426
00:28:21,015 --> 00:28:23,040
and then he's got the nerve
to talk about a real ship.

427
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,144
It's lucky you didn't have a muddy
field, or you'd still be there.

428
00:28:26,221 --> 00:28:30,590
If I were you I'd worry about that turkey
you and Gray are pushing around the sky.

429
00:28:30,658 --> 00:28:35,595
- The ruptured duck will get along okay.
- Oh, I'm insulted. Come on, fellows.

430
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:41,198
That won't take long to fix, sir.

431
00:28:41,269 --> 00:28:42,759
Ruptured duck.

432
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,913
Ted.

433
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:57,281
Don't you think Linda's a
good name, if it's a girl?

434
00:28:58,553 --> 00:29:00,544
Oh, yes, yes, it's fine.

435
00:29:02,023 --> 00:29:04,583
No, maybe Nichola. Nichola?

436
00:29:05,093 --> 00:29:07,789
That has a nice sound, don't you think?

437
00:29:08,596 --> 00:29:11,827
What's that? Oh, yes.

438
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,858
Look, honey, we don't have to
decide that right now, do we?

439
00:29:15,937 --> 00:29:16,995
No.

440
00:29:22,644 --> 00:29:23,736
Ted.

441
00:29:25,146 --> 00:29:27,341
He wasn't badly hurt, was he?

442
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:30,175
- Who?
- Johnny Adams.

443
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:33,049
- How'd you hear about Johnny?
- Those things get around.

444
00:29:33,121 --> 00:29:35,783
- He wasn't hurt, was he?
- Of course not.

445
00:29:35,857 --> 00:29:37,722
I don't know how those things get started.

446
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:40,556
Every time a guy does a noseover
on this field, it's a crack-up.

447
00:29:40,628 --> 00:29:41,686
Ted.

448
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:47,361
You've been working ever since
dinner. Come on, let's get some air.

449
00:29:47,769 --> 00:29:49,236
It's a deal.

450
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:58,103
Nice.

451
00:30:02,083 --> 00:30:05,382
I'm sorry we haven't had
more time together, Ellen.

452
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:09,350
We can spare a little. We've
got all the rest of our lives.

453
00:30:10,925 --> 00:30:12,392
That's right.

454
00:30:15,663 --> 00:30:18,723
Something blooming? It
smells good, doesn't it?

455
00:30:19,033 --> 00:30:20,625
- Ted.
- What?

456
00:30:20,702 --> 00:30:22,727
Please, don't worry about anything.

457
00:30:22,804 --> 00:30:26,103
I'm not worrying, just working, that's all.

458
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,835
You know, this is going to be quite a deal.

459
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,539
You're not worried about the deal.
You're worried because you've got a wife.

460
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:34,479
And that's wrong, Ted.

461
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:38,412
Say, Bob Gray hasn't been
trying to scare you, has he?

462
00:30:38,486 --> 00:30:40,283
- Of course not.
- Okay.

463
00:30:40,421 --> 00:30:42,446
Because there's nothing
to worry about, nothing.

464
00:30:42,524 --> 00:30:44,219
Silly, as if I didn't know that.

465
00:30:44,292 --> 00:30:46,988
Besides, if anything did happen, you've
got all that government insurance,

466
00:30:47,061 --> 00:30:50,519
that'll take care of you and
the baby for a long while.

467
00:30:51,799 --> 00:30:55,633
Oh, what am I talking about?
Nothing's going to happen anyhow.

468
00:30:55,737 --> 00:30:58,638
Ted, look at me.

469
00:30:59,507 --> 00:31:03,341
That baby and I, we won't
ever need anything but you.

470
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:06,780
We mustn't either of us
be scared about it, Ted.

471
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:11,308
Because the baby, the baby's why
I know you're coming back to us.

472
00:31:55,863 --> 00:31:59,026
We'd better make this one, or Shorty'll
never let us hear the last of it.

473
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:00,192
Yeah.

474
00:32:32,734 --> 00:32:35,100
- Hear those engines?
- Like music.

475
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,323
Come on, you hopped up bus drivers.

476
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:08,301
It's been 10 weeks work and
one night's fun. Let's go.

477
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:10,894
- I got my flaps up, brother.
- Heat it up there, Smitty boy.

478
00:33:10,972 --> 00:33:14,601
Steam and sizzle. Where you're
going, no one's gonna hold you tight.

479
00:33:14,676 --> 00:33:16,735
Hey there, Doc, don't you know how to dance?

480
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:18,745
When they start picking
flak out of your feet,

481
00:33:18,813 --> 00:33:20,644
you'll wish you'd put them to better use.

482
00:33:20,715 --> 00:33:23,343
I'm a doctor, not a jitterbug, Shorty.

483
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:41,301
- Hey, what gives?
- Shorty's throwing a party.

484
00:33:41,369 --> 00:33:42,427
A party? What for?

485
00:33:42,503 --> 00:33:45,836
Somebody said he's celebrating
Texas Constitution Day.

486
00:33:45,907 --> 00:33:49,866
- Texas Constitution Day?
- Say, I'm gonna sample this.

487
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:01,877
Grab your gal, Lawson.

488
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,651
Don't you know it's Sam Houston's birthday?

489
00:34:03,725 --> 00:34:04,714
Sam Houston?

490
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,818
For a guy that never saw Texas,
that Manch is really sold.

491
00:34:07,895 --> 00:34:10,591
- Hi, Lawson.
- Hi. How did this riot get started?

492
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:12,155
It's Texas Admission Day.

493
00:34:12,233 --> 00:34:15,327
And that ain't no riot, mister,
that's a full-fledged war.

494
00:34:15,403 --> 00:34:17,837
- Seen Ellen?
- I've seen everybody.

495
00:34:30,952 --> 00:34:32,886
- Hello, flyer.
- My dance?

496
00:34:32,954 --> 00:34:34,046
All of them, my boy.

497
00:34:34,122 --> 00:34:37,455
Every dance from now on
out, including the last one.

498
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:13,087
And I love you, Ski. I love
you, I love you, I love you.

499
00:35:25,339 --> 00:35:28,001
You know, it's a funny thing. That
Lawson used to be about as graceful

500
00:35:28,075 --> 00:35:30,236
as a Texas steer. Now, look at him.

501
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:32,302
Maybe the girl's got something to do with it.

502
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,041
Ah, you said it that time, Clever.

503
00:35:38,619 --> 00:35:41,110
You know, there's something
I mean to tell you more often,

504
00:35:41,355 --> 00:35:43,846
- but I never seem to get the chance.
- What is it?

505
00:35:43,925 --> 00:35:46,416
Just that I love you.

506
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:57,260
I got a letter from your mother
this morning. Forgot to tell you.

507
00:35:57,338 --> 00:35:59,829
She said to take good care of you.

508
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:04,067
- How am I doing?
- Better than mother ever dreamed of.

509
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,656
Here. Here.

510
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:28,551
Now smile and sing.

511
00:37:52,219 --> 00:37:53,550
Ted.

512
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,118
Telephone's ringing.

513
00:37:57,558 --> 00:38:00,994
- Telephone, Ted.
- Oh, sure.

514
00:38:09,603 --> 00:38:13,164
Yeah? Right now? Okay.

515
00:38:13,741 --> 00:38:15,333
Okay.

516
00:38:16,077 --> 00:38:17,874
Okay.

517
00:38:17,945 --> 00:38:19,344
What was it?

518
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,207
Oh, just another night
call. But what a night.

519
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:25,249
I'm sorry.

520
00:38:25,353 --> 00:38:26,945
What time is it?

521
00:38:28,289 --> 00:38:29,381
3:10.

522
00:38:30,658 --> 00:38:33,786
- Hung-over maybe a little?
- Oh, just a headache.

523
00:38:34,428 --> 00:38:37,158
- I'm not used to party life.
- Poor baby.

524
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:42,327
You go to sleep. I'll be
back by breakfast time.

525
00:38:43,104 --> 00:38:46,972
I'm so sleepy. Goodnight, darling.

526
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:50,377
Or rather, good morning.

527
00:38:51,712 --> 00:38:55,739
Boy, if I ever get a leave, I'm
going to sleep for six days solid.

528
00:38:55,816 --> 00:38:57,716
I wonder what this is.

529
00:39:10,431 --> 00:39:14,390
Well, men, your ships are all
serviced, gassed, and ready to go.

530
00:39:14,835 --> 00:39:16,928
You will take off in shifts,

531
00:39:17,138 --> 00:39:19,936
the first shift taking off in 45 minutes.

532
00:39:20,174 --> 00:39:23,041
Captain York will give you your clearances.

533
00:39:23,844 --> 00:39:27,245
Now there's one thing that
must be thoroughly understood.

534
00:39:27,314 --> 00:39:28,576
After you take off this morning,

535
00:39:28,649 --> 00:39:34,110
you are to see no one, speak to no one,
telephone no one, not even your wife.

536
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:37,457
There are no exceptions.

537
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:41,152
Continue your gas consumption
tests to your destination.

538
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:46,964
Now, the work you will be asked to do
will require a little low altitude flying,

539
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:50,228
so hedge-hopping on this
trip is perfectly okay.

540
00:39:51,105 --> 00:39:54,097
Only bear in mind that
cowboys wear pretty tall hats,

541
00:39:54,175 --> 00:39:57,906
so watch your step, men. That's all.

542
00:39:58,913 --> 00:40:03,543
I think you're very well prepared
for what you volunteered to do

543
00:40:05,286 --> 00:40:08,619
and I want to thank you
for a lot of good hard work.

544
00:40:09,123 --> 00:40:11,751
I'll see you in a few days. Good luck.

545
00:40:13,327 --> 00:40:15,420
I hope I get a chance to tell Ellen goodbye.

546
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:16,520
Yeah, you will.

547
00:40:16,597 --> 00:40:19,031
Your destination is Alameda field.

548
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,831
Take the southern route,
refuel at San Antonio and march.

549
00:40:23,904 --> 00:40:28,500
As your names are called you can
start. First flight, Holstrom,

550
00:40:29,210 --> 00:40:32,111
Jones, Lawson. Second flight...

551
00:40:42,389 --> 00:40:46,189
- Ted.
- Well, this is it, honey. We're off.

552
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,454
- How soon?
- Just got time to pack.

553
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:48,927
Where's my B-4 bag?

554
00:40:48,996 --> 00:40:51,464
- In the closet. I'll get it.
- Good.

555
00:40:54,034 --> 00:40:58,300
Socks, shirts.

556
00:41:01,442 --> 00:41:03,342
- My ties in the closet?
- Yes, I have them.

557
00:41:03,410 --> 00:41:04,502
Good.

558
00:41:11,185 --> 00:41:15,087
Wow! Don't go in there in your
bare feet, I broke a glass.

559
00:41:15,189 --> 00:41:16,520
All right.

560
00:41:16,924 --> 00:41:19,916
- You forgot your toothbrush.
- Oh, doggone it.

561
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:27,592
- We got everything?
- I think so.

562
00:41:27,668 --> 00:41:28,828
Swell.

563
00:41:38,779 --> 00:41:45,184
Well, be a good girl and
take good care of that baby.

564
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,247
- I will, Ted.
- Yourself, too.

565
00:41:51,258 --> 00:41:55,092
Oh, Ted, I'm going to write you
a letter every day you're gone,

566
00:41:55,162 --> 00:41:57,062
I know they won't deliver
them. I won't even mail them.

567
00:41:57,131 --> 00:42:00,931
But I'm going to write just the same.
That way, we'll kind of be in touch.

568
00:42:01,402 --> 00:42:03,495
That way, we'll feel close.

569
00:42:11,212 --> 00:42:12,440
Goodbye.

570
00:42:14,615 --> 00:42:16,014
Bye, flyer.

571
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:21,479
Tell me, honey. How come you're so cute?

572
00:42:22,623 --> 00:42:27,026
I had to be if I was gonna
get such a good looking fellow.

573
00:42:28,596 --> 00:42:30,564
I'll be back.

574
00:43:41,101 --> 00:43:43,501
Hey, the Bay Bridge is off to our right.

575
00:43:43,570 --> 00:43:46,095
The Bay Bridge is off to our right.

576
00:43:47,841 --> 00:43:49,809
The Bay Bridge? How about flying under it?

577
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,175
- For why?
- Well, so I can get some pictures.

578
00:43:52,246 --> 00:43:54,271
You know, shooting up at the superstructure.

579
00:43:54,348 --> 00:43:56,282
- Come on, Lawson.
- Do you want to?

580
00:43:56,350 --> 00:43:59,547
- Sure. Go ahead, if it'll make him happy.
- Thanks.

581
00:43:59,787 --> 00:44:02,347
I hope there are no cables
hanging under that span.

582
00:44:02,423 --> 00:44:03,822
Here we go.

583
00:44:21,508 --> 00:44:24,568
Let's take a turn and go it
again. I forgot to put film in.

584
00:44:24,645 --> 00:44:26,442
We're due at the field. Forget it.

585
00:44:26,513 --> 00:44:28,208
Oh, I may never get another crack at it.

586
00:44:28,282 --> 00:44:29,647
Hey, look.

587
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:35,147
McClure, take a look down there.

588
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:39,324
- It's a carrier.
- Yeah. And look at her deck.

589
00:44:39,693 --> 00:44:43,652
B-25's. Holy Smoke. Then this is it.

590
00:44:44,331 --> 00:44:45,798
Kind of small, isn't she?

591
00:44:45,866 --> 00:44:50,360
Pilot to bombardier. Pilot
to gunner. Pilot to gunner.

592
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:52,200
Thatcher. Thatcher.

593
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,300
It's dead again.

594
00:44:54,375 --> 00:44:56,775
We'd better report it to
Doolittle when we get in.

595
00:44:56,844 --> 00:45:01,178
Yeah, that left engine along with
it. Still seem a little rough to you?

596
00:45:01,715 --> 00:45:03,580
I can't tell anymore.

597
00:45:11,992 --> 00:45:16,122
- Is everything okay on your ship?
- Why, yes, sir, yes, sir.

598
00:45:16,597 --> 00:45:19,896
Taxi over to the edge of the carrier's
wharf. They'll take care of you there.

599
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:21,229
Yes, sir.

600
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,679
They don't even wait until a fellow gets out.

601
00:45:38,752 --> 00:45:42,017
- All Navy guys are cocky.
- Miller's a Navy guy.

602
00:45:42,089 --> 00:45:45,081
Well, Miller isn't
exactly Navy. He's a pilot.

603
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,037
Hey, Spike.

604
00:46:05,646 --> 00:46:07,341
- Spike.
- Spike, what's the matter?

605
00:46:07,414 --> 00:46:09,439
Oh, I put in a beef about my fuel pump

606
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:11,245
and Doolittle told me to
take her to the hangar.

607
00:46:11,318 --> 00:46:12,808
Well, then you're not going?

608
00:46:12,886 --> 00:46:14,877
No, and there's nothing
really wrong with that plane.

609
00:46:14,955 --> 00:46:17,753
- It's the best ship in the squad.
- Boy, that's rough.

610
00:46:17,825 --> 00:46:19,793
And I nearly told him about our interphone.

611
00:46:19,860 --> 00:46:21,350
You would've been a cooked goose.

612
00:46:21,428 --> 00:46:23,396
I think, sir, I'll go
and watch those Navy guys.

613
00:46:23,464 --> 00:46:27,127
- They might bang her up or something.
- That's a good idea.

614
00:46:31,805 --> 00:46:33,602
How do you like that?

615
00:46:40,013 --> 00:46:42,675
They're going to break the Duck's back sure.

616
00:46:42,749 --> 00:46:46,310
How did we get in the clutches
of these Navy guys anyhow?

617
00:46:52,659 --> 00:46:57,221
- Boy, that's an awful big ship.
- Yeah, let's take a look at her.

618
00:46:58,699 --> 00:47:00,166
- So long, Spike.
- So long, Spike.

619
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:02,964
- Be seeing you, Spike.
- Goodbye, fellows.

620
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:09,075
Lieutenant Lawson, reporting aboard, sir.

621
00:47:09,142 --> 00:47:12,669
- Bettinger, take Lieutenant Lawson to...
- 306, sir.

622
00:47:12,779 --> 00:47:14,576
- 306.
- This way, sir.

623
00:47:15,516 --> 00:47:17,245
See you guys later.

624
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,711
Lieutenant McClure, reporting aboard, sir.

625
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:54,678
These are your quarters, sir.

626
00:47:54,755 --> 00:47:56,689
Mr. White and Mr. Felton are on shore leave.

627
00:47:56,757 --> 00:47:58,088
Thank you.

628
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:02,654
Are you sure you'll be able to find
your way back up to the deck, sir?

629
00:48:02,729 --> 00:48:04,390
Oh, sure. Thanks.

630
00:49:07,294 --> 00:49:08,488
What are you doing down here?

631
00:49:08,562 --> 00:49:11,725
Oh, just looking around.
What are you doing here?

632
00:49:11,798 --> 00:49:13,561
Just looking around.

633
00:49:15,736 --> 00:49:19,263
- Are you lost too?
- Am I lost? I'm trapped like a rat.

634
00:49:19,339 --> 00:49:21,500
I've been walking for miles.

635
00:49:22,442 --> 00:49:24,569
This is the biggest
cockeyed ship I've ever seen.

636
00:49:24,645 --> 00:49:26,613
Yeah. And I wish the deck was twice as big.

637
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,843
<i>The smoking lamp is out.
The smoking lamp is out.</i>

638
00:49:34,154 --> 00:49:37,351
Sir, "The smoking lamp is out" means
no smoking anywhere on the ship.

639
00:49:37,424 --> 00:49:38,982
- Okay.
- Why is that?

640
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:42,620
Because they're refueling, sir. They'll
let us know when they're through.

641
00:49:45,198 --> 00:49:46,222
Hello.

642
00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:48,130
Well, you guys finally got on, huh?

643
00:49:48,201 --> 00:49:50,499
Yeah, we've just been looking the tub over.

644
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:52,037
- How are your quarters?
- Perfect.

645
00:49:52,105 --> 00:49:53,834
Nice room with two bunks and a cot.

646
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:57,900
A cot? Follow me, brothers. I'm
gonna show you real quarters.

647
00:49:57,978 --> 00:49:59,741
And I mean quarters.

648
00:50:02,215 --> 00:50:03,580
Hats. Hats.

649
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,716
- Well, look at what's here.
- Well, we have guests.

650
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:12,987
What's the idea of bringing people
up here from the tenement district?

651
00:50:14,628 --> 00:50:17,688
This is jocularly known
as the admiral's cabin.

652
00:50:18,031 --> 00:50:20,124
Looks like you guys are going
to have to start bathing.

653
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:23,192
This isn't all. There's
something else. Follow me.

654
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,897
I'd be glad to.

655
00:50:26,339 --> 00:50:28,500
Careful of the rugs, please.

656
00:50:31,044 --> 00:50:35,344
Now just inside, gentlemen, is something
to really feast your peepers on.

657
00:50:35,415 --> 00:50:39,146
The first guy turns in after
dinner gets this bed for the trip.

658
00:50:39,219 --> 00:50:41,517
You know who that'll be. Enter.

659
00:50:46,693 --> 00:50:49,924
What dirty, lowlife... Come
out of there, you boll weevil!

660
00:50:49,996 --> 00:50:52,829
Well, feed me corn and watch me grow.

661
00:50:53,100 --> 00:50:54,965
How did all this scum get in?

662
00:50:55,068 --> 00:50:56,365
And me in an Army cot.

663
00:50:56,436 --> 00:50:58,996
That's where he'll end up,
before the night's over.

664
00:50:59,072 --> 00:51:00,767
- Let's get out of here.
- Oh, Lieutenant!

665
00:51:00,841 --> 00:51:02,172
When you guys go down to dinner,

666
00:51:02,242 --> 00:51:04,608
would you mind bringing back
a roast beef sandwich, rare,

667
00:51:04,678 --> 00:51:07,579
and a piece of huckleberry pie, Lieutenant.

668
00:51:17,691 --> 00:51:20,956
- Well, are you still glad you came along?
- Sure. Aren't you?

669
00:51:21,027 --> 00:51:24,292
- I've got a funny feeling about this job.
- Yeah?

670
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:28,392
I think maybe it isn't going to be
as much of a cinch as we figured on.

671
00:51:28,468 --> 00:51:31,062
Yeah, I've been thinking the same thing.

672
00:51:31,138 --> 00:51:33,971
Well, my ship's over there. I
think I'll go take a look at it.

673
00:51:34,040 --> 00:51:35,530
Well, the Duck's up ahead.
I'll see you in the morning.

674
00:51:35,609 --> 00:51:37,474
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

675
00:51:46,052 --> 00:51:47,417
Who's that?

676
00:51:49,256 --> 00:51:50,985
- That you, Thatcher?
- Oh, yes, sir.

677
00:51:51,057 --> 00:51:53,025
Oh, forget it, Thatcher.

678
00:51:56,196 --> 00:51:58,255
Got her pretty well
lashed down, haven't they?

679
00:51:58,331 --> 00:52:00,561
Yes, sir. They did a good job.

680
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,960
I was kind of worried about her,

681
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:06,164
so I thought I'd better
come up and have a look.

682
00:52:07,007 --> 00:52:08,474
You lonesome?

683
00:52:09,276 --> 00:52:11,642
I guess everybody is a little, sir.

684
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:15,340
Don't bother with the sirs,
Dave. Your quarters all right?

685
00:52:15,782 --> 00:52:18,046
- Yeah. Fine.
- Grub's good, too, isn't it?

686
00:52:18,118 --> 00:52:20,780
The best I've had in a long time, sir.

687
00:52:22,155 --> 00:52:25,522
What are you going to do when
we get back home, Thatcher?

688
00:52:25,592 --> 00:52:30,188
Oh, I have a girl in Billings, sir.
I'm going to marry her, if we get back.

689
00:52:30,463 --> 00:52:32,658
Oh, we'll get back all right.

690
00:52:35,468 --> 00:52:36,935
Oh, hello.

691
00:52:37,337 --> 00:52:38,827
- Hello.
- Hello.

692
00:52:39,706 --> 00:52:45,440
I thought I'd come up and shoot the stars for
a little while, but I guess it's too foggy.

693
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,571
Pretty foggy, all right.

694
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:59,957
- What are you guys doing here?
- Oh, just getting a little air.

695
00:53:00,894 --> 00:53:04,455
- Yeah, it's pretty stuffy down below.
- Yeah, it sure is.

696
00:53:05,999 --> 00:53:09,526
You guys worry over the ruptured
duck like a bunch of old maids.

697
00:53:09,636 --> 00:53:11,433
Me, I'm going to bed.

698
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:13,569
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

699
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,164
Goodnight, Ted.

700
00:53:15,675 --> 00:53:17,643
Wonderful air, isn't it?

701
00:53:18,545 --> 00:53:21,981
<i>The smoking lamp is lit.
The smoking lamp is lit.</i>

702
00:53:39,366 --> 00:53:41,960
- What's wrong? What happened?
- Just battle stations.

703
00:53:42,035 --> 00:53:44,697
Around sunup and sundown the pig
boats give us a little trouble

704
00:53:44,771 --> 00:53:45,931
so we always lay for them.

705
00:53:46,006 --> 00:53:47,598
This is Jig White and I'm Bud Felton.

706
00:53:47,674 --> 00:53:49,733
- Glad to see you.
- Glad to see you.

707
00:53:49,809 --> 00:53:51,936
- How are you?
- See you later.

708
00:53:52,012 --> 00:53:54,810
- Are we underway?
- For the last five hours.

709
00:53:54,881 --> 00:53:57,111
Glad to have you aboard, Army.

710
00:53:57,284 --> 00:53:59,582
<i>General Quarters, man your battle stations.</i>

711
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:01,985
<i>Army personnel, man your planes.</i>

712
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:29,681
Boy, the only way you're going to get
that thing off of here is with a crane.

713
00:54:29,749 --> 00:54:33,742
Maybe so. But we kind of think
we can take off on our own power.

714
00:54:34,087 --> 00:54:36,214
Hey, where'd they come from?

715
00:54:37,557 --> 00:54:39,149
That's what's known as an escort.

716
00:54:39,225 --> 00:54:41,125
They just slipped up on us during the night.

717
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:43,458
The Navy likes to do things quietly.

718
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:46,556
Looks like it's really going
to be a show, doesn't it?

719
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,237
Boy, did I hate to part skin from
sheet this morning. What a bed.

720
00:54:52,172 --> 00:54:54,333
Oh, this is Shorty Manch.
Jig White and Bud Felton.

721
00:54:54,407 --> 00:54:55,772
- Hello.
- Hi y'all.

722
00:54:55,842 --> 00:54:58,834
This lucky stiff is sleeping in
the bedroom off the admiral's cabin.

723
00:54:58,912 --> 00:55:02,404
Yeah. Wonderful accommodations,
but nothing much to do.

724
00:55:02,782 --> 00:55:05,307
I thought there'd at least be a
poker game or something going on.

725
00:55:05,385 --> 00:55:07,250
Oh, I guess they have
them every once in a while.

726
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,381
How about Seven-Toed Pete? Do you
ever play much of that around here?

727
00:55:11,458 --> 00:55:12,789
What's Seven-Toed Pete?

728
00:55:12,859 --> 00:55:15,919
Well, it's a kind of seven-card poker.

729
00:55:15,996 --> 00:55:18,829
- I'd be glad to teach it to you some time.
- Never heard of it.

730
00:55:18,898 --> 00:55:20,798
<i>Attention, Army personnel!</i>

731
00:55:20,867 --> 00:55:24,325
<i>Attention, Army personnel!
Assemble in Ward Room.</i>

732
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:26,065
<i>- See you later, fellows.
- Assemble in Ward Room.</i>

733
00:55:26,139 --> 00:55:29,267
Well, it's been a great pleasure, fellows.
We'll certainly have to get together soon.

734
00:55:29,342 --> 00:55:32,004
Maybe we can get up that
little game of poker.

735
00:55:32,779 --> 00:55:34,269
See you later.

736
00:55:37,217 --> 00:55:40,345
You know, I believe that
boy wants to play poker.

737
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,878
I wonder if they got their
pay before they came aboard.

738
00:55:45,458 --> 00:55:46,857
As you were.

739
00:55:51,498 --> 00:55:54,490
For the benefit of those
who haven't already guessed,

740
00:55:54,567 --> 00:55:56,797
we're going straight to Japan.

741
00:55:57,637 --> 00:56:01,471
The Navy will take us within 400
miles of the Japanese mainland.

742
00:56:01,541 --> 00:56:04,772
We're going to bomb Tokyo, Yokohama,

743
00:56:05,645 --> 00:56:09,046
Kobe, Osaka, Nagoya.

744
00:56:11,551 --> 00:56:12,575
It'll be a night job and

745
00:56:12,652 --> 00:56:16,452
you will be given the opportunity
of choosing the city you prefer.

746
00:56:18,491 --> 00:56:21,324
Now, this is going to be a tight squeeze.

747
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:26,588
The Chinese have prepared small fields
just outside of Japanese occupied territory

748
00:56:26,666 --> 00:56:28,691
for us to land on after the raid.

749
00:56:28,768 --> 00:56:31,362
They'll gas us up and we'll
take off for Chungking.

750
00:56:31,438 --> 00:56:34,805
From now on we're in constant
danger of enemy attack.

751
00:56:35,708 --> 00:56:37,733
If there should be a surface attack,

752
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,802
stand by your planes with fire extinguishers

753
00:56:39,879 --> 00:56:41,972
and let the Navy handle it.

754
00:56:42,549 --> 00:56:47,111
If there should be an attack by air,
take off and make for the nearest land.

755
00:56:47,854 --> 00:56:51,688
The Navy will give all navigators
their bearings twice a day.

756
00:56:53,426 --> 00:56:56,224
Now once more, I want to emphasize that if...

757
00:56:56,296 --> 00:57:01,256
If any of you feel you're not up to this job,
it's perfectly all right for you to drop out.

758
00:57:01,734 --> 00:57:05,465
We have a few spare men and I
think we can fill your place.

759
00:57:08,374 --> 00:57:11,309
Get together with Captain York and
find out what to do with your planes.

760
00:57:11,377 --> 00:57:13,402
We'll meet here tomorrow afternoon at 2:30.

761
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:15,505
Are there any questions?

762
00:57:17,383 --> 00:57:20,978
Colonel, do you mind if we
smoke during these assemblies?

763
00:57:25,425 --> 00:57:28,861
I have no objection to that if
the Navy hasn't. Anything else?

764
00:57:28,928 --> 00:57:30,156
Dismissed.

765
00:57:33,099 --> 00:57:35,260
48, 49, 50.

766
00:57:35,335 --> 00:57:39,169
51, 52, 53, 54,

767
00:57:39,239 --> 00:57:42,970
55, 56... Oh, sorry, Manch.

768
00:57:43,042 --> 00:57:46,170
- Just getting a little exercise.
- Yeah? Well, I wasn't.

769
00:57:46,246 --> 00:57:48,874
I'm measuring off this cockeyed deck.

770
00:57:49,115 --> 00:57:50,139
Nine...

771
00:57:50,216 --> 00:57:54,118
<i>Attention, all personnel. You have been
wondering about the mission we are on.</i>

772
00:57:54,187 --> 00:57:55,313
<i>I think you might like to know</i>

773
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:58,755
<i>that the Army personnel on the
Hornet are going to bomb Japan.</i>

774
00:57:58,825 --> 00:58:02,386
<i>We of the Navy are going to take them
in as close to the enemy as possible.</i>

775
00:58:02,462 --> 00:58:03,861
<i>This is a chance for all of us</i>

776
00:58:03,930 --> 00:58:06,421
<i>to give the Japs a dose
of their own medicine.</i>

777
00:58:06,499 --> 00:58:08,399
<i>It's an Army-Navy show.</i>

778
00:58:08,635 --> 00:58:11,536
<i>Let's extend every courtesy
to the Army men on the Hornet</i>

779
00:58:11,604 --> 00:58:13,731
<i>who are going to do the job.</i>

780
00:58:14,374 --> 00:58:16,808
<i>Good luck, good hunting</i>

781
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,304
<i>and may God speed us on our mission.</i>

782
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:21,711
Have some?

783
00:58:22,515 --> 00:58:24,005
Thanks, buddy.

784
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:32,915
You're awfully lucky for guys who
never heard of Seven-Toed Pete.

785
00:58:33,860 --> 00:58:36,590
They tell me Virginia's a
great hunting country, too.

786
00:58:36,663 --> 00:58:39,894
What's that? Oh, yeah. Let's play, fellows.

787
00:58:39,966 --> 00:58:42,264
- What's the bet?
- It's up to you, Manch.

788
00:58:42,335 --> 00:58:44,565
Don't they call Virginia
the Mother of Presidents?

789
00:58:44,637 --> 00:58:47,105
Yeah. I mean... Bet five.

790
00:58:47,674 --> 00:58:48,698
Up ten.

791
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,470
Thomas Jefferson lived there, too, didn't he?

792
00:58:50,543 --> 00:58:51,601
I drop.

793
00:58:51,678 --> 00:58:53,703
A lot of guys lived there.

794
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:56,806
Are you sure you never
played Seven-Toed Pete before?

795
00:58:56,883 --> 00:58:58,407
Makes it ten to you, Manch.

796
00:58:58,484 --> 00:59:02,045
Have they finally gotten that hookworm
situation under control down there?

797
00:59:02,121 --> 00:59:04,954
There never has been a case
of hookworm in Virginia.

798
00:59:05,024 --> 00:59:07,822
- I've got a small straight.
- Mine's seven to the jack.

799
00:59:07,894 --> 00:59:09,156
All pink.

800
00:59:09,662 --> 00:59:12,358
Well, that beats. I think I'll turn in.

801
00:59:12,465 --> 00:59:14,558
- Somebody's won a lot of dough.
- A little.

802
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:16,795
- You just had a run of bad cards, Manch.
- Yeah.

803
00:59:16,869 --> 00:59:18,302
What say we get together again pretty soon?

804
00:59:18,371 --> 00:59:19,804
Oh, sure. See you later.

805
00:59:19,872 --> 00:59:23,603
Say, you haven't got any books
on Virginia, have you, Manch?

806
00:59:24,477 --> 00:59:28,106
You Army guys are real pigeons.
I wish you were in the Navy.

807
00:59:30,116 --> 00:59:33,517
You take the bunk, Lawson. I'll
sleep here, if you don't mind.

808
00:59:33,586 --> 00:59:36,612
- What's the idea?
- That thing's as soft as a feather bed.

809
00:59:36,689 --> 00:59:38,714
I never could sleep in it.

810
00:59:45,231 --> 00:59:48,792
Yeah. It's not bad. Thanks. Thanks a lot.

811
00:59:49,402 --> 00:59:53,304
Lieutenant Randall is going to tell
us something about a carrier takeoff.

812
00:59:53,373 --> 00:59:54,772
Mr. Randall.

813
00:59:58,177 --> 01:00:01,510
From the minute you're in your
planes, I'm the man to watch.

814
01:00:01,581 --> 01:00:06,245
Have your engines turning over as soon
as the man in front of you starts taxiing.

815
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:09,311
When I want you to rev
up, I'll give you this.

816
01:00:10,156 --> 01:00:11,783
Now, if your engines don't sound right to me,

817
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,986
I may have to keep you revved up
longer than you think necessary,

818
01:00:15,061 --> 01:00:18,030
I can hear your engines and tell when
they're missing better than you can.

819
01:00:18,097 --> 01:00:21,328
When I want you to start
taxiing, I'll give you this.

820
01:00:21,401 --> 01:00:24,996
Now you're in position.
I give you a final rev.

821
01:00:25,972 --> 01:00:29,772
And when I drop it, you're off.

822
01:00:31,311 --> 01:00:34,109
We'll aim you straight
for Japan. One more thing.

823
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:36,739
Once we're lined up for the takeoffs,

824
01:00:36,816 --> 01:00:38,647
there can be no delays.

825
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,812
If your plane stalls, if it
doesn't start immediately,

826
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:43,048
if you have any trouble of any kind,

827
01:00:43,122 --> 01:00:45,488
we won't have time to do anything about it.

828
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:48,823
The Navy crew has orders
to push the ship overboard

829
01:00:48,895 --> 01:00:51,125
and make way for the next one.

830
01:00:52,365 --> 01:00:55,061
Lieutenant Jurika has
detailed maps and pictures

831
01:00:55,134 --> 01:00:57,432
of cities and specified targets.

832
01:00:57,503 --> 01:01:00,438
Mr. Jurika spent a great many years in Japan.

833
01:01:01,207 --> 01:01:03,471
I think it might be a good
idea if he gave you some idea

834
01:01:03,543 --> 01:01:05,477
of what kind of people
you're going to run up against

835
01:01:05,545 --> 01:01:07,342
in case you're forced down.

836
01:01:07,980 --> 01:01:09,379
Mr. Jurika.

837
01:01:12,385 --> 01:01:15,786
I was Assistant Naval Attach
at our embassy in Japan,

838
01:01:16,122 --> 01:01:19,421
long enough to learn a few
things about the Orient.

839
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,994
Just what should we do, Mr. Jurika?

840
01:01:23,062 --> 01:01:27,362
How should we conduct ourselves in
case we are forced down over Japan?

841
01:01:28,568 --> 01:01:32,163
My advice is, see that you're
not forced down over Japan.

842
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,937
The run I've got figured
out for you starts here.

843
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:40,044
The smokestacks are bright red
brick, and you can't miss them.

844
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,637
One of the largest smelters in Japan.

845
01:01:41,714 --> 01:01:45,775
Then, following the line of the bay
and allowing 10 seconds between bombs

846
01:01:45,852 --> 01:01:48,412
you should take out this and this.

847
01:01:48,488 --> 01:01:50,888
Both of them are machine
shops owned by brothers,

848
01:01:50,957 --> 01:01:54,415
I forget their names but I
remember I didn't like them.

849
01:01:55,461 --> 01:02:00,228
Then on out here to drop your incendiary.
How does this line up for you, Lawson?

850
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,199
Well, you're going to drop them, Clever.

851
01:02:02,268 --> 01:02:05,567
The run seems all right
for me if it's okay for you.

852
01:02:06,038 --> 01:02:07,733
- We can take them out.
- Fine.

853
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:09,866
Jones, have you got the
course laid out for this run?

854
01:02:09,942 --> 01:02:11,933
Yes. Over here, fellows.

855
01:02:14,514 --> 01:02:17,415
Now you'll take off about
here. You go due west to Tokyo

856
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:20,475
at minimum cruising speed,
flying at about 50 feet.

857
01:02:20,553 --> 01:02:22,748
When you hit the bay, get up to about 1,500

858
01:02:22,822 --> 01:02:25,620
complete your bombing run,
then down again and out to sea,

859
01:02:25,691 --> 01:02:29,354
- south by southeast to Yakushima.
- Can we take the maps with us?

860
01:02:29,429 --> 01:02:30,760
All you need.

861
01:02:30,830 --> 01:02:32,229
Be sure there are no marks on them though,

862
01:02:32,298 --> 01:02:33,856
which might show the Japs where you came from

863
01:02:33,933 --> 01:02:35,833
in case you're captured.

864
01:02:35,902 --> 01:02:39,065
By the way, I'm taking off
first with four incendiaries.

865
01:02:39,138 --> 01:02:41,129
That should light up
Tokyo pretty well for you.

866
01:02:41,207 --> 01:02:44,370
Suppose by the time we get to China, the
Japs have taken over the landing field?

867
01:02:44,444 --> 01:02:47,038
The Chinese will arrange a signal
for you when you get to the field

868
01:02:47,113 --> 01:02:48,774
if the Japs have captured it.

869
01:02:48,848 --> 01:02:52,011
If that's the case you've got to keep
right on going until you've run out of gas

870
01:02:52,084 --> 01:02:54,780
then bail out and destroy your planes.

871
01:02:55,655 --> 01:02:56,713
Yes.

872
01:02:56,823 --> 01:02:58,313
There's just been a change in the disposition

873
01:02:58,391 --> 01:03:00,882
of the barrage balloons over Tokyo.

874
01:03:01,093 --> 01:03:02,890
This balloon and this one

875
01:03:02,962 --> 01:03:07,456
were moved this morning to here and here.

876
01:03:14,807 --> 01:03:17,970
You know, the changes in
those balloons threw me.

877
01:03:18,978 --> 01:03:22,209
Just think, a bunch of guys
sweating all day in a sub

878
01:03:22,281 --> 01:03:25,114
down under Tokyo bay, guys just like us

879
01:03:25,518 --> 01:03:28,612
sneaking up at night to
radio balloon positions.

880
01:03:29,021 --> 01:03:31,421
Just let me hear anybody
talk about the Navy again.

881
01:03:31,491 --> 01:03:33,049
Boy, they're good.

882
01:03:33,125 --> 01:03:36,652
Plenty. They're not bad at poker either.

883
01:03:36,762 --> 01:03:38,992
Oh, you're not kidding.

884
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:42,330
I kind of figured on getting Ellen
a present in Chungking, you know,

885
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:43,993
a kimono or something.

886
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:46,231
But these Navy guys have cleaned me.

887
01:03:46,305 --> 01:03:49,172
Believe it or not, I've only got 14 bucks.

888
01:03:49,642 --> 01:03:51,405
Well, I got $8 or $10 I could let you have.

889
01:03:51,477 --> 01:03:53,911
Oh, no. No. I've been thinking,

890
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:56,710
cigarettes sell for 60 cents
a carton on the boat here.

891
01:03:56,782 --> 01:03:59,046
But in Chungking, I hear the
boys will pay seven bucks.

892
01:03:59,118 --> 01:04:00,107
Yeah?

893
01:04:00,186 --> 01:04:02,416
So I figure I may load
the duck with coffin nails.

894
01:04:02,488 --> 01:04:04,251
Hey, that's an idea.

895
01:04:08,661 --> 01:04:11,129
- It's a good night for subs.
- Yeah.

896
01:04:13,032 --> 01:04:14,556
You know, it's funny.

897
01:04:14,634 --> 01:04:18,730
When I was a kid I used to dream
about going someplace on a ship.

898
01:04:19,906 --> 01:04:21,498
Well, here I am.

899
01:04:22,008 --> 01:04:23,908
And out there is Japan.

900
01:04:24,243 --> 01:04:26,677
My mother had a Jap gardener once.

901
01:04:27,046 --> 01:04:29,446
He seemed like a nice little guy.

902
01:04:30,550 --> 01:04:32,984
You know, I don't hate Japs, yet.

903
01:04:34,287 --> 01:04:38,747
It's a funny thing. I don't
like them, but I don't hate them.

904
01:04:39,559 --> 01:04:41,493
I guess I don't either.
You get kind of mixed up.

905
01:04:41,561 --> 01:04:42,619
Yeah.

906
01:04:42,695 --> 01:04:45,789
It's hard to figure. Yet here we are.

907
01:04:45,865 --> 01:04:49,164
All I ever wanted to be was
an aeronautical engineer.

908
01:04:49,235 --> 01:04:52,170
I joined the Army in '40 because I
figured it was the best way to learn.

909
01:04:52,238 --> 01:04:54,934
I wasn't sore at anybody.

910
01:04:55,007 --> 01:04:57,066
But here you suddenly
realize you're going to drop

911
01:04:57,143 --> 01:05:00,306
a ton of high explosives on one
of the biggest cities in the world.

912
01:05:00,379 --> 01:05:02,347
You're not getting squeamish, are you?

913
01:05:02,415 --> 01:05:03,575
Oh, no, of course not.

914
01:05:03,649 --> 01:05:07,141
I don't pretend to like the
idea of killing a bunch of people

915
01:05:07,219 --> 01:05:08,880
but it's the case of drop a bomb on them

916
01:05:08,955 --> 01:05:12,049
or pretty soon they'll
be dropping one on Ellen.

917
01:05:13,192 --> 01:05:14,921
Yeah, that's right.

918
01:05:15,561 --> 01:05:17,859
I wonder how many of us will pull through.

919
01:05:17,930 --> 01:05:20,228
Oh, they figure about half.

920
01:05:20,433 --> 01:05:23,459
- And everybody thinks he'll be in that half.
- Yeah.

921
01:05:23,536 --> 01:05:28,200
- When are you going to get married, Bob?
- Oh, when I find somebody like Ellen.

922
01:05:28,274 --> 01:05:30,834
It'd be swell, you know. The four of us.

923
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:33,845
You know, when this is over I'd
like to get me a small ranch.

924
01:05:33,913 --> 01:05:37,212
Something that'd run about
40 or 50 head of cattle.

925
01:05:38,150 --> 01:05:41,677
A nice well and a house.
It'd be wonderful for kids.

926
01:05:41,754 --> 01:05:44,348
I've always been kind of
nuts about ranches myself.

927
01:05:44,423 --> 01:05:45,913
You know, in a decent year
you can make real dough

928
01:05:45,992 --> 01:05:47,926
out of 40 head of cattle, if you've got feed.

929
01:05:48,327 --> 01:05:51,353
- Why don't we do something like that?
- Well, I'm game if you are.

930
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:54,228
- Okay, it's a deal.
- Good.

931
01:05:56,135 --> 01:06:00,333
Of course, now if we had 80 head of
cattle we'd really have ourselves a layout.

932
01:06:00,406 --> 01:06:03,341
- Yeah, and our own meat too.
- Oh, yeah, milk, butter, eggs,

933
01:06:03,409 --> 01:06:05,001
the whole works.

934
01:06:05,511 --> 01:06:06,603
You know, a guy who's got himself a place,

935
01:06:06,679 --> 01:06:08,044
he doesn't have to worry about anything.

936
01:06:08,447 --> 01:06:12,110
- And with a little hunting near.
- Oh, sure, that's easy.

937
01:06:13,152 --> 01:06:14,813
Gosh, I'll be glad when this war ends.

938
01:06:16,489 --> 01:06:19,219
In the event of an emergency
there will be no assembly.

939
01:06:19,291 --> 01:06:23,557
No last minute instructions.
We'll just take off.

940
01:06:23,629 --> 01:06:26,496
<i>If you should develop motor trouble within
a half hour after leaving the Hornet,</i>

941
01:06:26,565 --> 01:06:28,726
fly back to the ship and land in the water.

942
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:31,536
The Navy will try to fish you out.

943
01:06:32,038 --> 01:06:35,371
If trouble should develop after that
time, you'll have to keep right on going.

944
01:06:35,441 --> 01:06:38,808
Because by that time the fleet will
have to fire on any craft overhead.

945
01:06:38,878 --> 01:06:41,870
I don't want you to throw out the
extra cans of gas as you use them.

946
01:06:41,947 --> 01:06:44,882
<i>That would leave a perfect trail for
the Japs to follow back to the Hornet.</i>

947
01:06:44,950 --> 01:06:48,147
Save the cans and throw
them all out at one time.

948
01:06:49,455 --> 01:06:52,652
Now let me repeat something
I've said previously.

949
01:06:53,292 --> 01:06:57,558
You are to bomb the military targets
assigned to you and nothing else.

950
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:04,194
Of course, in an operation of this
kind you cannot avoid killing civilians.

951
01:07:04,303 --> 01:07:07,170
Because war plants are manned by civilians.

952
01:07:08,474 --> 01:07:11,637
If any of you have any moral
feelings about this necessary killing,

953
01:07:11,711 --> 01:07:15,772
if you feel that you might think
of yourself afterward as a murderer,

954
01:07:15,848 --> 01:07:18,908
I want you to drop out. We'll
find someone to take your place.

955
01:07:18,984 --> 01:07:21,919
And I promise you that no one
will blame you for your feelings.

956
01:07:21,987 --> 01:07:27,118
Barring any sudden switch in plans,
we'll take off tomorrow night.

957
01:07:31,330 --> 01:07:33,230
There's one thing more.

958
01:07:35,501 --> 01:07:37,696
When we meet in Chungking
I'm going to throw you a party

959
01:07:37,770 --> 01:07:40,671
that you can tell your grandchildren about.

960
01:07:44,606 --> 01:07:50,545
You're a great bunch of guys. I'm
proud to be associated with you.

961
01:07:52,648 --> 01:07:54,013
Good luck.

962
01:07:56,885 --> 01:07:59,080
- 12 cartons of cigarettes.
- 12 cartons?

963
01:07:59,154 --> 01:08:00,143
Say, what gives with the Army?

964
01:08:00,222 --> 01:08:02,019
I've never sold so many
cigarettes in my life.

965
01:08:02,091 --> 01:08:04,992
- We're chain smokers.
- You must eat them. What kind will it be?

966
01:08:05,060 --> 01:08:06,186
Oh, any kind.

967
01:08:06,261 --> 01:08:08,729
- You just want lots of cigarettes.
- You hit it right on the head.

968
01:08:08,797 --> 01:08:10,162
All right.

969
01:08:13,435 --> 01:08:14,561
That'll be $7.20.

970
01:08:27,483 --> 01:08:31,920
<i>Now hear this. Our carrier task force
has been sighted by enemy surface vessels.</i>

971
01:08:31,987 --> 01:08:35,946
<i>All Army pilots and crews, man
your planes for immediate takeoff.</i>

972
01:08:36,425 --> 01:08:39,292
There goes a Jap just three
minutes after we sighted her.

973
01:08:39,361 --> 01:08:42,797
Yeah. That means she had two
minutes to tell Tokyo what she saw.

974
01:08:42,865 --> 01:08:46,062
<i>Now hear this. Get all
bombs loaded on the double.</i>

975
01:08:46,135 --> 01:08:48,729
- Are you all packed?
- Have been for five days, sir.

976
01:08:48,804 --> 01:08:50,829
Good. Better watch how
those guys handle the Duck.

977
01:08:50,906 --> 01:08:51,895
I will, sir.

978
01:08:51,974 --> 01:08:53,464
And don't tell anybody
about that bumped turret.

979
01:08:53,542 --> 01:08:55,009
I won't, sir.

980
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,110
- Hey, we're off, aren't we?
- Yeah!

981
01:08:59,181 --> 01:09:01,843
Oh, bomb me, daddy!

982
01:09:03,585 --> 01:09:05,519
I think I've got everything packed.

983
01:09:05,587 --> 01:09:06,747
- Swell, thanks.
- I'm sorry we couldn't have

984
01:09:06,822 --> 01:09:08,289
picked out a little better weather for you.

985
01:09:08,357 --> 01:09:11,190
- We'll make it. So long, Felton.
- Give them a pasting they'll never forget.

986
01:09:11,260 --> 01:09:14,127
We will. Look, thanks for everything.

987
01:09:14,196 --> 01:09:17,962
You guys in the Navy, well,
you're okay. Be seeing you.

988
01:09:19,435 --> 01:09:23,201
<i>Now hear this. Clear the
flight deck to start engines.</i>

989
01:09:29,044 --> 01:09:30,978
Hey, how about my change?

990
01:09:49,164 --> 01:09:51,792
They're giving us fifteen
extra cans instead of ten.

991
01:09:51,867 --> 01:09:55,826
Good. At least getting off now
will put us over Tokyo in daylight.

992
01:09:55,904 --> 01:09:57,895
Don't forget about the barrage
balloons in daylight too.

993
01:09:57,973 --> 01:09:59,270
Oh, next you'll be telling me it's good

994
01:09:59,341 --> 01:10:00,808
because you can get better
pictures in the daytime.

995
01:10:00,876 --> 01:10:04,642
- You're not kidding about that, either.
- Let's give her a final check.

996
01:10:09,952 --> 01:10:11,544
Hey, Bob.

997
01:10:11,787 --> 01:10:14,153
- What?
- Are you up ahead?

998
01:10:14,223 --> 01:10:15,383
Fourth spot.

999
01:10:15,457 --> 01:10:16,890
See you in Chungking.

1000
01:10:17,025 --> 01:10:18,549
You said it, brother.

1001
01:10:32,441 --> 01:10:35,171
- How they doing?
- Doolittle will be off any second.

1002
01:10:35,244 --> 01:10:38,702
Then Hoover, Holstrom, Gray
and Davey Jones, we're seventh.

1003
01:10:38,814 --> 01:10:39,906
Seven's a lucky number.

1004
01:10:39,982 --> 01:10:45,443
Ted, Ted. Hey, Ted, Ted, hey.
Put these some place, will you?

1005
01:10:45,521 --> 01:10:47,250
- What are they?
- Sizzle platters.

1006
01:10:47,322 --> 01:10:50,223
I've got the phonograph in my ship.
But I haven't got room for the records.

1007
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:53,557
We'll meet in Chungking
and cut a Chinese rug.

1008
01:10:53,629 --> 01:10:55,096
Okay, Shorty.

1009
01:10:57,466 --> 01:11:00,162
- Take care of these, will you, McClure?
- Right.

1010
01:11:01,837 --> 01:11:04,169
<i>- Pilot to gunner.
- Gunner to pilot. Go ahead, sir.</i>

1011
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:06,173
<i>Take a look at the turret
if you get a chance.</i>

1012
01:11:06,241 --> 01:11:08,573
I've been working on that,
sir. She's still jammed.

1013
01:11:08,644 --> 01:11:10,305
We'll use the auxiliary power if we have to.

1014
01:11:10,379 --> 01:11:11,505
<i>Right, sir.</i>

1015
01:11:12,114 --> 01:11:14,514
We've got ourselves in a
fine jam, haven't we, Lawson?

1016
01:11:14,583 --> 01:11:16,608
Well, this is a great time to think of that.

1017
01:11:16,685 --> 01:11:18,710
Oh, no, I mean having to
take off ahead of schedule.

1018
01:11:19,388 --> 01:11:22,482
Oh, I'm sorry, Davenport. I
guess maybe I'm a little on edge.

1019
01:11:22,558 --> 01:11:25,391
- Bomb bay clear?
- Bomb bays clear.

1020
01:11:28,263 --> 01:11:30,629
- Clear on right?
- Clear on right.

1021
01:11:34,536 --> 01:11:36,800
- Clear on left?
- Clear on left.

1022
01:12:37,165 --> 01:12:38,860
He made it. He made it.

1023
01:12:39,968 --> 01:12:41,367
Get your flaps up.
