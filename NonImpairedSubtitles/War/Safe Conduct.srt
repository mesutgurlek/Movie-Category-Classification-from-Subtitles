1
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:20,646
Dedicated to those
who lived through these events

2
00:00:31,197 --> 00:00:34,997
SAFE CONDUCT

3
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,830
She's coming. Hop to it!

4
00:00:39,205 --> 00:00:40,331
Got the flowers?

5
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,666
I was taking them up.

6
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,511
Clear the whole floor.

7
00:00:45,712 --> 00:00:47,680
Everybody out of sight! Move it!

8
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,849
Come back in 5 minutes!

9
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:53,849
Just one minute.

10
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,521
Like last Tuesday.

11
00:00:57,557 --> 00:01:00,025
Carnations? Not for an actress!
I told you!

12
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:02,623
She'll murder me! Marcel, help me!

13
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:11,296
She's here, ladies!
To your rooms, please!

14
00:01:11,504 --> 00:01:13,972
Him and his dame!
What a fuss he makes!

15
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:16,472
You don't know who this "dame" is!

16
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:19,804
Everyone knows. It's Suzanne Raymond.
I saw her movies...

17
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:23,308
Please, out of sight, all of you!
Shoo!

18
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,644
If you need cigs...

19
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:28,650
Maybe later. In you go.
Take care of that cough.

20
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:30,649
Out of sight! Thanks!
Shoo!

21
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:37,994
Not again!

22
00:01:38,364 --> 00:01:39,661
Got the champagne?

23
00:01:40,366 --> 00:01:41,993
Snap to it!

24
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:57,008
What a mess!
What did I do to deserve this?

25
00:02:27,013 --> 00:02:29,481
See him? The Kraut in room 25.

26
00:02:29,682 --> 00:02:30,808
Get in here.

27
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:33,979
He threatened me again.

28
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,318
Someday I'll sock him.

29
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,150
Aren't you gorgeous!

30
00:02:38,858 --> 00:02:42,157
These things...
always happen to you.

31
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,830
Gorgeous, gorgeous...

32
00:02:45,698 --> 00:02:47,495
You smell so sweet.

33
00:02:48,034 --> 00:02:50,662
What a pretty little puppy nose,
nice and cold.

34
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,336
True, I'm freezing.

35
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,508
God, what a winter!

36
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:56,834
What a winter!

37
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:59,000
Think so?

38
00:03:00,046 --> 00:03:01,604
See how I slipped in?

39
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:04,446
Nobody saw me.

40
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:06,275
But still,

41
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:08,446
I felt so sad.

42
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:10,956
So sad.

43
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:15,127
- I didn't get the part.
- What part? Why?

44
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,455
The Cayatte movie. The False Mistress.

45
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:20,966
Can I have some tea?
Steaming hot tea?

46
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,464
Better than tea...

47
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,137
Champagne!

48
00:03:25,672 --> 00:03:27,469
Champagne's too cold.

49
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,967
But it's a cold that warms.

50
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:31,806
Tea.

51
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,305
Tea?

52
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:35,973
Then tea it is.

53
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:40,641
Darrieux will get it.
They said it's either her or me.

54
00:03:41,187 --> 00:03:43,485
Nonsense! I shouldn't have bothered.

55
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:45,488
It was made for Darrieux.

56
00:03:45,858 --> 00:03:48,656
Everything's made for her.
She's perfect from take one.

57
00:03:48,861 --> 00:03:53,321
I'm never sure of myself.
Nothing comes easy.

58
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,334
I'm fed up. Fed up!

59
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,101
I'm such a goose!

60
00:04:02,308 --> 00:04:05,436
How can you say that?

61
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,945
Would I write for a goose?

62
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:10,775
Hold on...

63
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:14,286
Your passionate lover
- It'll be little Francois Perier -

64
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,286
recites a letter about your frolics.

65
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:20,117
Your husband may have intercepted it.

66
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,291
You: "You really wrote all that?"

67
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,294
Him: "Yes, my love."

68
00:04:24,497 --> 00:04:28,627
You: "Must you always go on
about things we did together?"

69
00:04:28,835 --> 00:04:31,303
"What's the point? I was there!"

70
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:32,801
That's nice!

71
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,974
That's me all over.

72
00:04:35,174 --> 00:04:36,801
I just love it.

73
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:38,807
I adore you!

74
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:42,978
Put this outside the door.

75
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:45,309
You knock, then scoot!

76
00:04:45,518 --> 00:04:47,315
Come on, now!

77
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,487
The champagne.

78
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,993
Stay.

79
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,766
Go on, then.

80
00:05:05,705 --> 00:05:07,434
But be careful. And the tea!

81
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,767
Ask for tea.

82
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,103
Do you have any tea?
Yes, tea.

83
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,776
Don't have any?
That's okay. Thanks.

84
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:18,945
They have none... Tea, coffee.
Why not real sugar?

85
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,289
Where do I put this?

86
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,288
Damn!

87
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:28,785
What's the matter?

88
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,292
I've made a mess!

89
00:05:30,496 --> 00:05:33,294
The script for Roland Tual,
Love Letters.

90
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,467
He's expecting it tomorrow.

91
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,796
It soaks up like a blotter!
Look at that!

92
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,466
Hear that?

93
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,642
Rumbling.

94
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,901
It's thunder.

95
00:05:46,546 --> 00:05:47,570
Come over here!

96
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:50,647
Not thunder, planes.
Lots of them.

97
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,311
Only the Germans have planes.

98
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:56,488
They wouldn't bomb Paris,
they're in it!

99
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,491
No, it's freezing out!

100
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,592
I have to see!

101
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,759
They're far away, over the suburbs...

102
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:06,926
What is it?

103
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,930
It's coming from above.

104
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:11,269
What a sight!

105
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:15,538
What's that light? It's beautiful.

106
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:18,269
It's an air raid, all right.

107
00:06:18,478 --> 00:06:21,276
- Close it! It's freezing!
- They're bombing!

108
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,948
Close your window, Mr. Jean!

109
00:06:23,149 --> 00:06:24,616
The Brits are bombing Renault!

110
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,114
Close it, Jean!

111
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,617
Down we go!

112
00:06:30,323 --> 00:06:31,620
Never any privacy!

113
00:06:31,824 --> 00:06:34,952
First the champagne,
then the phone, and now planes!

114
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:38,460
I refuse to be seen in a shelter!

115
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:40,461
We're calmly going to do
what I came for.

116
00:06:40,666 --> 00:06:43,635
Calmly? We're being bombed!

117
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:46,304
And if we're being bombed,
I can't do a thing.

118
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,303
Let me handle this.

119
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,763
To the shelters!

120
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:24,776
Is there a doctor?

121
00:07:34,987 --> 00:07:37,114
Shut off the mains!

122
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:52,304
No, Mr. Devaivre!
To the shelters!

123
00:07:52,505 --> 00:07:53,972
I'm getting my son.

124
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,641
He's safe. Your wife's here.

125
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,640
It's you! Got a flashlight?

126
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:00,478
- I'll get one?
- C'mon!

127
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,755
Find something to cover them.
Sheets and blankets.

128
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,613
Simone!

129
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,785
You okay?

130
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:48,953
I'm okay.

131
00:08:57,737 --> 00:08:59,295
Seen Dr. Pelletier?

132
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,914
The raid's over.

133
00:09:16,122 --> 00:09:17,020
I'm not so sure.

134
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,109
The flares looked like fireworks
at first.

135
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,957
- What're you doing?
- Taking him.

136
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:03,791
It's 60¢´ here with the windows closed.
At home, it's 34¢´.

137
00:10:04,003 --> 00:10:05,630
You sure?

138
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:51,843
Take the kid!

139
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,793
Please, can you help me?

140
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,383
Not the small ones, Roger!

141
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,992
The big ones, under your nose!

142
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:43,491
The Brits' bombs
work better than worms!

143
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,390
What're you doing?

144
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,827
Fishing! "The miracle of the fishes!"

145
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,165
We have to finish the scene tonight.

146
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:53,497
We'll be right in. The power's out.

147
00:12:53,706 --> 00:12:54,832
We'll save you one.

148
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,945
We're already behind.

149
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:06,618
We'll be here till 6 a.m. again.

150
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,116
How is it outside?

151
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,948
Not a pretty sight. Bodies everywhere.

152
00:13:11,157 --> 00:13:13,284
They were really popping!
And real close!

153
00:13:16,996 --> 00:13:19,965
The phone's busy. George sent a cyclist
to the power station.

154
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:22,464
The bridges are out.

155
00:13:22,835 --> 00:13:25,963
How do I get home?
My husband'll be worried sick.

156
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:28,966
Fish, you guys!
There's plenty for everyone!

157
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:30,142
Fish?

158
00:13:30,342 --> 00:13:34,301
If the cables are damaged,
we're in for a long wait.

159
00:13:34,513 --> 00:13:37,482
Check them. If it comes back on,
we don't wait.

160
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,317
It will be a while.

161
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,985
We'd do the same.

162
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:45,487
Renault makes trucks and motors...
They come and bomb, it's fair play.

163
00:13:45,691 --> 00:13:48,990
Fair play, no!
There are the rules of war.

164
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:52,164
You don't bomb the wounded,
priests, or artists!

165
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:54,992
Boulogne's full of artists,
and movie studios.

166
00:13:55,201 --> 00:13:58,500
Everyone knows it.
The civilized world, anyway.

167
00:13:58,704 --> 00:14:01,002
As if the civilized world still existed.

168
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:02,937
I've got a theater gig next.

169
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,608
Ladies and gentlemen,

170
00:14:05,144 --> 00:14:07,271
we have to finish this long scene.

171
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,947
We have very little film left.

172
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,614
They're striking the set tomorrow.

173
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,954
So give it all you've got. Thanks!

174
00:14:17,456 --> 00:14:21,119
Spare the candles!
They have to match.

175
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,464
Mr. Le Chanois is waiting upstairs.

176
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:28,633
I'm going up.

177
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:30,631
How's your baby? Not too scared...?

178
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,304
Don't waste your breath.
He never stops.

179
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:35,473
I call him Speedy.

180
00:14:37,743 --> 00:14:39,472
I was about to leave.

181
00:14:40,346 --> 00:14:41,313
Sandwich.

182
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:45,813
I also brought you carbon paper.

183
00:14:46,852 --> 00:14:48,820
This is an epic!

184
00:14:49,021 --> 00:14:50,488
Read it later.

185
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:53,317
What if my wife can't decipher it?

186
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:57,154
Here's the dialogue for Salou...

187
00:14:58,697 --> 00:15:00,995
The power! I have to get back.

188
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:02,031
Hold on!

189
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:05,763
Comrades are getting nabbed.
There are informers everywhere.

190
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:08,098
- I know them.
- Not all of them!

191
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:11,105
Nicolas Hayer beat it
before the Fritz came knocking.

192
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,108
Mickey Bouladoux got pinched.
It stinks!

193
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:15,609
Mickey?

194
00:15:16,315 --> 00:15:17,282
So?

195
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,117
Clouzot offered me a job.

196
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,280
Aurenche gave up adapting
a Nerval story.

197
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,955
Clouzot put me on it.

198
00:15:24,323 --> 00:15:26,791
Tourneur needs an assistant.
You!

199
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:29,620
But Clouzot's Continental,
and Continental's German!

200
00:15:29,828 --> 00:15:33,286
Exactly! When you're in
the lion's jaws, he can't bite.

201
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:36,794
Even the French police
can't snoop at Continental.

202
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,469
That's 50% less hassle.

203
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,635
And the other 50%?
I'll think it over.

204
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:43,467
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- I'll call you.

205
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:45,473
You can't. I moved.

206
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:46,640
Again?

207
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,972
Bretons are great travelers.

208
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,983
We dolly in on the table.

209
00:15:52,184 --> 00:15:54,311
The table for two.

210
00:16:00,359 --> 00:16:01,917
The 103 on the table for two!

211
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:13,268
Quiet on the set!
We're back to work and glad of it!

212
00:16:13,973 --> 00:16:17,431
Places, everyone!
Off with your overcoats!

213
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,770
I'm cramped. I need to pull back.

214
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:23,779
Mr. Arrignon needs room.
Push back the sound booth.

215
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:27,445
- Buy some chocolate?
- We're rehearsing!

216
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:28,779
I'm interested.

217
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:34,955
What's that funny smell?

218
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,788
Fish. In the sound booth.
Not much left.

219
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,965
Move me back, please.

220
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:42,463
A little more.

221
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,630
- Mark it.
- Done, sir.

222
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:49,474
Tench is no better or worse than carp.

223
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,142
It tastes like whatever it's cooked in.

224
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:53,140
Cook it in sauce, it tastes good.

225
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:55,813
Cook it in muck, it tastes like muck.

226
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:01,751
Stop the hammers!

227
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:03,748
The hammers!

228
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,924
Silence!

229
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:09,094
Miss Gautier's shawl, please.

230
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:12,593
This wait had too many minutes.

231
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,592
Try to be not too dumb!

232
00:17:15,968 --> 00:17:17,435
Camera!

233
00:17:19,138 --> 00:17:21,936
8 Men in a Chateau.
Scene 82, take 1!

234
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:24,601
Action!

235
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:02,078
Punish the Vichy Torturers

236
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:07,073
The grips had a good catch.
Here's our share.

237
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:10,414
Good. Jacques's coming for dinner.
He just called.

238
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:13,087
I was at the nursery. It's quiet.

239
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,423
There's a card from your brother Louis.
From Germany.

240
00:18:17,296 --> 00:18:19,093
Awful handwriting!

241
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,595
Is it the cold?

242
00:18:21,366 --> 00:18:22,594
What kind of fish?

243
00:18:22,801 --> 00:18:25,304
- Tench.
- Any good?

244
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:28,102
Better than barbel
and not as good as carp.

245
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,436
I brought you some carbon paper.

246
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:33,778
Almost new.

247
00:18:33,979 --> 00:18:36,277
And a new tract to type in 7 copies?

248
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:41,286
It's not "traiter," it's "traitor."

249
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:48,790
"Someday soon Berlin and Tokyo
may burn under Allied bombs."

250
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:51,119
You believe that?

251
00:18:52,831 --> 00:18:56,631
Cleaned, scaled and chopped,
we could make soup.

252
00:18:56,835 --> 00:18:58,803
If we have gas to cook.

253
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:02,064
You know Nerval's The Magic Hand?

254
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:05,243
Jean-Paul backed me as assistant.
He's scripting it.

255
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,072
I can't decide.

256
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:10,908
You two get along well.

257
00:19:11,116 --> 00:19:13,914
The producer's the hitch. Continental.

258
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,417
The Fritz?

259
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,426
Do what you think is best...

260
00:19:32,137 --> 00:19:35,265
The elevator's off limits.
For those gentlemen only.

261
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,278
Mr. Tourneur's expecting us.

262
00:19:44,149 --> 00:19:47,448
The glass door at the back: Greven.
The big cheese.

263
00:19:47,653 --> 00:19:50,622
On the right, Bauermeister.
Watch your step with him.

264
00:19:50,822 --> 00:19:53,120
Clouzot's there.
He runs the script department.

265
00:19:56,662 --> 00:19:58,960
Greetings, Aurenche. No regrets?

266
00:19:59,164 --> 00:20:01,962
For The Magic Hand? None.
But you'll do fine.

267
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:05,295
Updating Nerval stumped me.
But you'll find a way.

268
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:09,295
As I told Greven
Either you can or you can't.

269
00:20:09,675 --> 00:20:13,475
Or, you will or you won't.
Did Herr Doktor understand you?

270
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,477
He acted like it.
He pesters the hell out of me!

271
00:20:17,182 --> 00:20:18,649
I'm running late.

272
00:20:25,257 --> 00:20:26,315
What's Clouzot like?

273
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:28,493
A tough nut, but he plays straight.

274
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,341
Here, here and here... our offices.

275
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,505
At the end, a minefield!

276
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:56,517
Mr. Tourneur... Jean Devaivre.

277
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:00,357
You have a fine reputation.

278
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:03,786
I know you finished
Mediterranean Alert.

279
00:21:05,163 --> 00:21:08,792
How would you describe
an assistant director's job?

280
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:13,304
The director's in charge.
He bears full responsibility,

281
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,308
but only has 2 eyes.
An extra pair comes in handy.

282
00:21:19,745 --> 00:21:21,144
Have you read
Le Chanois's script?

283
00:21:21,346 --> 00:21:23,974
The treatment. It's not finished.

284
00:21:31,857 --> 00:21:33,825
Bryau's always cold.

285
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:38,428
Von Schertel... SD.

286
00:21:39,031 --> 00:21:39,827
SD?

287
00:21:40,032 --> 00:21:41,329
Controls the SS.

288
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:44,726
- What's he doing at Continental?
- Renting space.

289
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:48,839
Understand German?

290
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,839
My wife gets by.
Me, not a word.

291
00:21:52,044 --> 00:21:54,342
Many speak excellent French.

292
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,848
My rule is simple: make good films.

293
00:21:57,049 --> 00:22:00,018
Artistic and script matters
see Mr. Clouzot.

294
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:03,115
For administrative issues
Mr. Bauermeister.

295
00:22:03,655 --> 00:22:05,782
Like all directors, actors
and key technicians,

296
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:07,286
you'll be given a pass.

297
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:16,464
You must be ready for an August shoot.
You'll have 28 days.

298
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,307
Come, Tourneur, let's have lunch.

299
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:29,480
Spaak told me about A Shady Business.

300
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,645
Balzac. Fine.

301
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,153
I won't work for Continental. Period!

302
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,156
I can't keep turning Greven down.

303
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,655
You must help me.
When you won't, you won't.

304
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:45,660
Sure, sure. Stop kicking the mahogany.
It scratches, too.

305
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,495
Hold on...

306
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:49,500
Don't move.

307
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:52,329
There. Sure I'll help you.

308
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,506
But stop kicking the furniture.
It's distracting.

309
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:59,332
Helping a friend like you
will be easy. How?

310
00:22:59,811 --> 00:23:00,743
Put me under contract.

311
00:23:01,313 --> 00:23:02,109
Fabulous!

312
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:05,943
Avoid the rock and the soft spot.
I'll have a project next month.

313
00:23:06,485 --> 00:23:10,444
I need a contract today. Predated.
I signed one 2 weeks ago.

314
00:23:11,656 --> 00:23:12,623
With whom?

315
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:16,282
With you. In this office.
It's easy enough to understand.

316
00:23:16,928 --> 00:23:20,295
I won't work for the Jerries,
or end up in Berlin or in prison.

317
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,795
I keep turning Greven down,
I need an excuse. You must save me.

318
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,138
First finish Three-Way Romance.

319
00:23:27,506 --> 00:23:30,304
It's finished.
We need something else,

320
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,133
for 3, 6 months. 10 years!

321
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:34,304
Something else...

322
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:35,480
I have it.

323
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,478
Double Six. The play. Read it.

324
00:23:38,850 --> 00:23:41,148
- A play? By whom?
- Achard.

325
00:23:41,953 --> 00:23:44,148
- You mean Domino.
- I wanted The Lover from Borneo.

326
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:48,325
It's a dream title...
Borneo, Africa, tigers...

327
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:52,823
There are no tigers in Africa.
And Borneo's in Asia.

328
00:23:53,465 --> 00:23:56,332
Movies are made of dreams,
and dreams can't be mapped out.

329
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:01,763
I have something else.

330
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:04,608
Roland Tual will produce
if you distribute.

331
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:06,437
- The title?
- Love Letters. Listen...

332
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:08,613
No, no, I'll take it!

333
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:12,773
I'm sobbing already. Love Letters.
It's worth its weight.

334
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,282
We'll fool Greven.

335
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:18,490
I have Gravey.
His contract is a plague!

336
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:22,119
- He asking a lot?
- Yes, and a pound of butter a week.

337
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:24,124
- What for?
- For bartering.

338
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:26,297
To work! I'm head over heels in work.

339
00:24:26,832 --> 00:24:31,633
Find me pre-war subjects.
Passion, gaslamps, backstairs...

340
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,806
- Back-streets.
- Back-streets. With peepholes.

341
00:24:35,006 --> 00:24:36,974
I can never keep up with you.

342
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:38,142
So my wife says.

343
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:41,312
She's a great bridge player.
She costs me.

344
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,806
She play for money?

345
00:24:43,682 --> 00:24:45,650
But if she plays well, she wins?

346
00:24:45,851 --> 00:24:46,818
All the time.

347
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,542
So why does she cost you?

348
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:49,817
It's beyond me.

349
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,649
Why are we talking about this?

350
00:24:52,858 --> 00:24:55,326
Tell Greven
we have a 3-picture contract.

351
00:24:55,694 --> 00:24:57,992
Strange man! Seen his office chest?

352
00:24:58,363 --> 00:24:59,660
- The what?
- The chest.

353
00:24:59,865 --> 00:25:00,490
Storage chest?

354
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:04,760
No, man's chest.
The head... like on statues!

355
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,601
Like buster.

356
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:09,933
He hangs his coat and hat on it.

357
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:11,935
So I saw. And?

358
00:25:13,478 --> 00:25:15,446
Mussolini with a hat on his head!

359
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:18,445
You mean Hitler.
Logical for a German dignitary.

360
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:22,116
The thing has a forelock: Mussolini!

361
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:27,792
Mussolini's forelock!

362
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:32,789
The guy starts a sentence,
but you never know...

363
00:25:33,665 --> 00:25:35,292
Did I sign a contract or not?

364
00:26:02,794 --> 00:26:04,091
Why does he keep doing that?

365
00:26:04,462 --> 00:26:05,759
He had a lobotomy.

366
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,591
But he must do it for a reason.

367
00:26:08,133 --> 00:26:10,431
He thinks you're a Jew.

368
00:26:48,506 --> 00:26:50,303
Tomorrow, I'll have lettuce.

369
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,095
What brings you here?

370
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,602
I was in the neighborhood.

371
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,270
For you.

372
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,107
Shall I get Olga?

373
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,276
Good timing. She's free at this hour.

374
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,606
A Comedie Francaise actor
mentioned you.

375
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,782
One who often plays priests.

376
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,281
Can I take those?

377
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,112
Oh, Jeannot!

378
00:27:38,390 --> 00:27:40,119
My fingers are numb.

379
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,293
Goddamned suitcases!

380
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,625
The handles cut through your fingers.

381
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,626
I hate 'em!

382
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:49,299
A wheelbarrow's better.

383
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:51,628
Maybe not on a staircase...

384
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,308
They say it's very nice in French.
Very sad.

385
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,907
Not too heavy?

386
00:28:02,113 --> 00:28:04,081
This place has become total chaos!

387
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:06,481
A new table?

388
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:08,412
A gift from Paul.

389
00:28:08,787 --> 00:28:10,414
He deals in hot furniture.

390
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,590
Madame knows him
from his vice squad days.

391
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,757
He rents space upstairs
and pays in services.

392
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,757
It's just for a day or two.
Until I find...

393
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,932
There's no hurry.

394
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,435
Make yourself at home.

395
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:27,931
- You want a bath?
- Still have hot water?

396
00:28:28,139 --> 00:28:30,107
Sure! For the Germans.

397
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,104
Put those in the closet.

398
00:28:34,646 --> 00:28:36,614
They'll wrinkle in your suitcase.

399
00:28:45,757 --> 00:28:47,122
This all the same story?

400
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,122
No. I wish it was.

401
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:52,294
- How do you keep track?
- I manage.

402
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:55,125
If not, I start over.
It's better sometimes.

403
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:58,300
Besides, clutter has a certain charm.

404
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,070
Honeysuckle vines are lot more fun

405
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:04,070
than matches in a box,
or a military parade.

406
00:29:04,442 --> 00:29:06,569
I keep track very easily.

407
00:29:06,778 --> 00:29:08,746
You don't look like it.

408
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:12,909
My life's a mess, not my papers.

409
00:29:13,618 --> 00:29:16,416
It's my own fault. I always say yes.

410
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,915
- Because you're nice.
- Maybe so, but...

411
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:22,093
I say yes to producers,
hucksters, and women.

412
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:25,922
So I'm broke, I have 4 scripts
and 3 women on my hands.

413
00:29:26,131 --> 00:29:28,099
No, 4 women and 3 scripts.

414
00:29:29,467 --> 00:29:30,661
Come on. It's cold.

415
00:29:33,972 --> 00:29:36,941
Those handbags in the closet...
You collect them?

416
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:40,004
That's for later.

417
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,609
When I open a shop.

418
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,613
I won't end up in a sailor's brothel.

419
00:29:47,986 --> 00:29:50,454
I'll have my own business.

420
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:54,450
A leather goods shop.

421
00:29:55,493 --> 00:29:56,960
Luxury stuff.

422
00:30:03,501 --> 00:30:05,469
Handbags are so pretty.

423
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:09,306
Even empty, they're pretty.

424
00:30:13,178 --> 00:30:15,476
It's fine, but...

425
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:18,144
The set's too big.

426
00:30:18,683 --> 00:30:21,652
Too wide for Stage 4.
Two yards too long.

427
00:30:23,021 --> 00:30:25,819
With a 35, we won't frame it all.

428
00:30:26,691 --> 00:30:27,988
If I place it diagonally on A...

429
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,726
But on the A there's the gallery.

430
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,158
We have to cut it down.
Or take out this wall.

431
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,167
I noted the camera angles
on the floorplan.

432
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:39,998
I'll work it out.

433
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:42,336
Cut this, maybe.

434
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,843
Add arch. Gives volume.

435
00:30:46,044 --> 00:30:48,672
And the paintings there?

436
00:30:51,282 --> 00:30:53,682
They're for the painter's studio.

437
00:30:54,719 --> 00:30:57,187
I painted two, small ones.

438
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,187
Good. Arches, cats...

439
00:31:01,492 --> 00:31:04,290
Clouzot doesn't like
Le Chanois's dialogue.

440
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:07,293
He says it lacks "punch."
That's the word he used.

441
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,466
Here are both versions.
You decide.

442
00:31:09,667 --> 00:31:10,793
I'll read them tonight, sir.

443
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:16,467
For the historical explanation
of the severed hand,

444
00:31:16,674 --> 00:31:18,801
we have to simplify. Too long.

445
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,478
Or we ask for an extra day or two.

446
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:23,907
We said 28 days. 28!

447
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:26,976
If there is an extension,

448
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:29,813
it will be an extension of 600 miles.

449
00:31:30,021 --> 00:31:34,651
We'll send you to Babelsberg
to study German production methods.

450
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:45,992
And if we sent you to Stalingrad,
to study crawling methods.

451
00:31:47,872 --> 00:31:49,169
Here's your pass.

452
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,343
Mr. Greven just signed Palau.

453
00:31:52,543 --> 00:31:54,841
Good. You won't be sorry.

454
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:57,340
And your contract? Bring it in signed.

455
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:01,280
He'll be great as the Devil. Palau...

456
00:32:03,221 --> 00:32:05,621
He's got funny eyes, like a duck.

457
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:06,854
Palau... No?

458
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:10,958
Talk him into it. It's Dad's birthday.
Make an effort.

459
00:32:11,162 --> 00:32:13,289
You realize the work load he has?

460
00:32:13,498 --> 00:32:16,797
That's just it. He needs a break,
and it's Sunday. So come...

461
00:32:17,402 --> 00:32:19,802
"People of Paris, the French must fight!

462
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:22,131
"Turn out in force and demonstrate!

463
00:32:22,340 --> 00:32:24,308
"The gas is on only 4 hours a day!"

464
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:27,144
The union must be joking!
Go and fight...

465
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:29,973
With what? And why? For gas?

466
00:32:30,181 --> 00:32:31,307
Jacques, please!

467
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:32,813
C'mon, this is a riot.

468
00:32:33,017 --> 00:32:36,316
He has you type Communist tracts
but he was on the other side.

469
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:39,484
He fights a war, great!
But he works for the Germans.

470
00:32:39,757 --> 00:32:41,816
Not for. Under the Germans.

471
00:32:46,364 --> 00:32:48,332
So how's Clouzot's dialogue?

472
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:51,501
Your brother's getting...

473
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:54,331
You slave weekends, for them!

474
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:59,002
I work on films. For Tourneur,
Clouzot and myself.

475
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:01,607
To learn. And I'm always learning.

476
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:05,341
Then shoot. Direct your first film.

477
00:33:06,317 --> 00:33:08,785
Not now.
Not until we've kicked them out.

478
00:33:08,987 --> 00:33:12,616
And I haven't signed a contract.
I never will.

479
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:16,285
So how about Sunday?
Are you coming?

480
00:33:16,494 --> 00:33:18,621
Can't we put it back a week?

481
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:21,124
We'll celebrate Christmas
on Bastille Day.

482
00:33:21,332 --> 00:33:23,300
Mom found a duck and turnips.

483
00:33:23,501 --> 00:33:24,468
We can set it back.

484
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,968
But the duck's plucked.
It's this Sunday or never.

485
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:29,799
I'll come with the baby.

486
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:33,310
Jean will drop by.

487
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:35,138
I took two tracts.

488
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,484
I'll come for lunch.

489
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,982
I love duck!

490
00:33:43,254 --> 00:33:44,653
Devaivre?

491
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,824
This is Didot. Marc Valbel's friend.

492
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:48,651
Hold on.

493
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:56,165
Last year you had some apples.
Got any left?

494
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,669
I need two.
Remember where we met with Marc?

495
00:34:00,204 --> 00:34:01,102
Sure, I do.

496
00:34:01,305 --> 00:34:02,772
I'll meet you there.

497
00:34:02,974 --> 00:34:04,441
- Now?
- Now.

498
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:11,945
I have to run. I won't be long.

499
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,977
- You know, I'm going...
- You said the less we know...

500
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:48,142
I'll put the baby to bed.

501
00:34:48,686 --> 00:34:50,483
I'll do the ironing.
I'll wait up for you.

502
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,154
I have a pass.

503
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:27,121
You're getting thin.

504
00:35:30,761 --> 00:35:32,058
Over there.

505
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,370
Let's see them.

506
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:55,976
Good.

507
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,318
Let's go.

508
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:02,250
- Where they from?
- I stole them the day of the Armistice.

509
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,090
I took them home.

510
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:08,428
You got a head start.

511
00:36:09,133 --> 00:36:14,935
"A gray duck, a blue duck, a white duck

512
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:21,945
"The white duck walks behind
the blue duck walks ahead

513
00:36:22,313 --> 00:36:25,282
"The white duck is fattest,

514
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,616
"I'll sell it for 20 francs...

515
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,612
Would you have fired?

516
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,967
You picked up some coal.
Very clever.

517
00:38:59,503 --> 00:39:01,232
You don't talk much.

518
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:04,907
Usually, the guys I take along
run off at the mouth.

519
00:39:08,012 --> 00:39:09,570
In three minutes, bang!

520
00:39:11,382 --> 00:39:13,577
Any special reason
for going after the Fritz?

521
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,244
I just want them out, that's all.

522
00:39:19,123 --> 00:39:20,420
Let's go.

523
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:37,607
And the van?

524
00:39:37,808 --> 00:39:39,275
I don't know whose it is.

525
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,671
So long!

526
00:39:55,826 --> 00:39:57,293
Polish it good!

527
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:04,126
Activate the work!

528
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,734
You really pulled it off.

529
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:11,633
The statue... A great idea!

530
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:13,373
It adds to the scene.

531
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,306
Every camera angle is a good one.

532
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:18,539
And the paintings, great!

533
00:40:19,183 --> 00:40:21,151
It can all be dismantled.

534
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:23,820
The Krauts won't believe their eyes.

535
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:26,483
"In Babelsberg we do this, we do that."

536
00:40:27,124 --> 00:40:30,651
But look what we can do
with the little they give us.

537
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:33,425
Nice work, Mr. Andrejew!

538
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:39,594
This one.

539
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:43,837
The latest tract. Make 8 copies.
For the art department.

540
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:46,839
"I hear the sound
of boots, boots, boots!"

541
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:49,342
"It's the first carabinier!"

542
00:40:53,717 --> 00:40:54,684
Greetings!

543
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:57,518
- How are your trotters?
- We manage!

544
00:40:58,556 --> 00:41:02,117
It's dumb losing your toes in Russia
when your name's Softi.

545
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,954
How many was it?
Frostbitten toes?

546
00:41:05,162 --> 00:41:08,620
3 left toes, 2 right.
You bet, it was 40 below!

547
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,630
No time to go out for a pee.

548
00:41:17,241 --> 00:41:19,300
I got some liquid butter. Want some?

549
00:41:19,510 --> 00:41:21,307
No, thanks.

550
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:31,981
You can tell there's a war on.
Even in June it's freezing!

551
00:41:35,693 --> 00:41:37,490
War shakes up the skies, too.

552
00:41:38,128 --> 00:41:40,824
I got you darlings lung
from the butcher's.

553
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:44,835
They gave it to me in a shoebox
to avoid jealousy.

554
00:41:45,035 --> 00:41:47,663
Then getting it by the concierge,
a fortune!

555
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:50,506
You're rich folks' cats!

556
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,173
But you know,

557
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:56,004
the poor are the same.
They go hungry to feed their pets.

558
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,243
Crumbs for birds, birds for cats!

559
00:41:59,550 --> 00:42:01,108
If only they'd eat them!

560
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:06,286
You might say, if they're poor,
it's because they're not too bright.

561
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:08,782
I got us some calf liver!

562
00:42:10,327 --> 00:42:12,955
- Taking down what she says?
- It's automatic.

563
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:15,131
Read me something you wrote?

564
00:42:16,867 --> 00:42:20,132
It's been a bad day.
No, wait...

565
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,635
Here's something I like...

566
00:42:28,345 --> 00:42:30,973
A scene between the count,
Douce's father,

567
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,646
- And the beautiful young woman.
- The teacher? Like your mom?

568
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,481
She was a governess.

569
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:37,153
The count says something funny.

570
00:42:37,354 --> 00:42:39,822
She laughs. That makes him happy.

571
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:43,216
He: "I love to see you laugh.
You don't laugh enough."

572
00:42:43,794 --> 00:42:46,820
She: "But, sir,
I've never been so happy."

573
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,499
He's very moved.

574
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:53,334
"Truly? How I wish
to see you carefree!"

575
00:42:53,537 --> 00:42:54,834
I like that: "carefree."

576
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:57,605
I tried "happy" but it's too dull.

577
00:42:58,442 --> 00:43:00,000
"Easy-going" didn't fit.

578
00:43:00,210 --> 00:43:02,110
That's more like us girls.

579
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:05,441
"Easy women," like they say.
Carefree is better.

580
00:43:05,983 --> 00:43:08,952
I love to see you laugh.
You don't laugh enough.

581
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:12,951
I fear this house is too gloomy,
too austere for you.

582
00:43:15,159 --> 00:43:16,456
I've never been so happy.

583
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:20,619
Truly? How I wish to see you carefree.

584
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:24,961
You even write on death notices?

585
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,466
Whatever comes to hand.

586
00:43:26,670 --> 00:43:28,035
- A relative?
- An uncle.

587
00:43:28,238 --> 00:43:29,466
Was he rich?

588
00:43:29,673 --> 00:43:31,470
He was old and blew every cent.

589
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:38,477
You come from a weird family! Books!

590
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:40,813
I'm getting nowhere!

591
00:43:41,418 --> 00:43:44,319
And when you get nowhere,
you repeat yourself. You ramble.

592
00:43:45,022 --> 00:43:46,489
So that's why you were sighing.

593
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:49,491
Luckily, Bost will fix it.

594
00:43:49,693 --> 00:43:50,990
The man you work with?

595
00:43:52,196 --> 00:43:54,323
Pierre Bost is gifted. He's a writer.

596
00:43:54,865 --> 00:43:55,661
And you aren't?

597
00:43:55,866 --> 00:43:57,993
I'm a juggler, a pied piper.

598
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,501
- A poet.
That's sweet

599
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:10,276
Known this Mr. Bost long?

600
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:16,446
We worked on a film 5 years ago,
but not at the same time.

601
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:18,281
We only just met.

602
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,949
He was released recently
for excessive thinness.

603
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,129
His release form read

604
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:28,124
"Displays a pathetic look."

605
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:30,031
Bost is terrific.

606
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,632
I want to dazzle him. It inspires me.

607
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:37,129
It forces me to...
Yes, I want to dazzle Bost.

608
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:41,638
If I didn't know you, I might wonder
Does he like women or men?

609
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:44,310
Women, naturally. Too much!

610
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:47,143
The girls' mail. Take it up.

611
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,319
Checkups are on Friday.

612
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:52,822
Do they mean
next Friday or every Friday?

613
00:44:53,857 --> 00:44:56,155
At least the Germans write in French.

614
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:59,655
That one's fine.
Now the 112 on the statue.

615
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:05,101
Say, Thirard, for the street scene...

616
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:07,770
Walking my dog this morning,
I noticed long shadows.

617
00:45:07,971 --> 00:45:11,099
It produced quite a terrific,
mysterious effect.

618
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:13,936
That's what I want: very long shadows!

619
00:45:14,144 --> 00:45:16,112
You'll have them, sir.

620
00:45:16,313 --> 00:45:18,611
I need a hand here.

621
00:45:19,316 --> 00:45:21,284
I told you, no smoking.

622
00:45:21,485 --> 00:45:22,952
What cig?

623
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:26,779
Stand in for Mr. Fresnay.
The camera will follow you.

624
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:38,801
- Your butts are gross!
- Not at all!

625
00:45:39,169 --> 00:45:41,467
If you were as well groomed
as my cigs...

626
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:45,130
I steam 'em, dry 'em, comb 'em,
mix 'em with endive,

627
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:48,971
and I add corn silk.
A real treat!

628
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,810
"...so I think life is short,
and hell eternal."

629
00:45:53,350 --> 00:45:55,648
- 48 secs. 79 feet.
- We have the film?

630
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:56,979
No, sir.

631
00:45:57,187 --> 00:45:59,985
I'll cut the shot in two.
I need 55 feet.

632
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,750
With a short end of 65 feet
and a quick clap, it'll do.

633
00:46:03,627 --> 00:46:06,755
Hear that, men?
The first take has to be right.

634
00:46:06,964 --> 00:46:09,762
Our first takes
have been right for weeks!

635
00:46:17,641 --> 00:46:19,108
They're coming!

636
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:21,274
They're coming!

637
00:46:26,817 --> 00:46:27,841
Butts!

638
00:46:35,826 --> 00:46:36,952
My extinguisher!

639
00:46:37,161 --> 00:46:38,287
Just checking!

640
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,457
Arthur, watch the sound booth!

641
00:46:52,009 --> 00:46:53,977
A swivel stool for Mr. Fresnay!

642
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:56,646
How long, Mr. Thirard?
Problems, Mr. Nee?

643
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:58,144
None, fella.

644
00:46:58,348 --> 00:47:00,145
Get that tattle filter out of the way.

645
00:47:03,787 --> 00:47:05,254
Mr. Bauermeister!

646
00:47:06,623 --> 00:47:08,090
I'm glad to see you.

647
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:16,762
Shooting only with short ends
is a juggling act.

648
00:47:17,134 --> 00:47:19,102
We need extra film stock.

649
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:24,599
Not a foot. You ate up too much film
for the early scenes.

650
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:29,602
The mountain inn set...
Too many angles, too many takes.

651
00:47:29,980 --> 00:47:33,438
You went too far,
so you're punished: B1497short ends.

652
00:47:34,318 --> 00:47:36,946
I know you'll do just fine.

653
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:41,389
Your hair's too long.
A matter of dignity.

654
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:48,787
They won't provide longer short ends,
so they shorten the hair.

655
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:51,794
Besides, long hair is filthy.

656
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:57,303
Gentlemen, to work!

657
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:07,079
- Hello, Mr. Manuel.
- Is Mr. Tourneur still here?

658
00:48:07,618 --> 00:48:08,915
He's in his office.

659
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:12,247
I came to tell him
I won't be scoring his film.

660
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:13,787
You're quitting?

661
00:48:22,966 --> 00:48:24,934
Look after yourself, sir.

662
00:48:29,373 --> 00:48:30,931
The wind has to change someday.

663
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:43,114
Children, Paul needs the table.

664
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:46,448
Relax, he'll replace it.

665
00:48:46,657 --> 00:48:50,457
Sorry. I sold this one.
That's business!

666
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:54,119
No hurry. My boys won't be here
for half an hour.

667
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:55,965
They'll have another one.

668
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:00,633
So, you're in the movies?

669
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:05,730
Quite a world! You're lucky.
I love artists!

670
00:49:06,276 --> 00:49:07,743
She can tell you.

671
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:10,243
Especially famous artists.

672
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:13,917
I had Raimu over for dinner here.
I live upstairs.

673
00:49:15,619 --> 00:49:16,745
Raimu!

674
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:19,422
A quart of olive oil got him here!

675
00:49:20,524 --> 00:49:22,924
You know any stars? I'll invite them.

676
00:49:23,126 --> 00:49:24,923
Name one, I'll see to it.

677
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:26,425
Not everyone likes olive oil.

678
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:27,756
Anything!

679
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,756
I can get anything. I have connections.

680
00:49:32,302 --> 00:49:34,270
Give me some names.

681
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:37,106
- Off the top of my head?
- Let's hear it.

682
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,434
Alerme.

683
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,270
Debucourt.

684
00:49:42,479 --> 00:49:43,776
Gravey.

685
00:49:45,148 --> 00:49:47,275
Sorry, I don't know him...

686
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,120
Women, rather. Women are pretty.

687
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,957
I have perfume.

688
00:49:54,157 --> 00:49:56,284
Stockings.

689
00:49:58,128 --> 00:49:59,789
Moreno.

690
00:50:00,330 --> 00:50:01,957
Marguerite Moreno.

691
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:04,463
That old bag? He pulling my leg?

692
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:08,468
He's a fan. He's seen your films.
He can talk about them.

693
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:11,467
It's just a lunch.
Anything more is your business.

694
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,636
What's this guy do?

695
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:15,641
He's in business. Like everyone.

696
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:17,973
Business, business! What kind?

697
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:22,315
Property, I think.
He deals in furniture.

698
00:50:22,519 --> 00:50:24,646
He's an antique dealer?

699
00:50:24,921 --> 00:50:27,651
Yes... I don't know. Maybe.

700
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:30,152
He may not know gothic
from Louis Seize,

701
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:33,989
but he trades furniture
on the black market.

702
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:36,995
We're his guests.
You'll get a gift of your choice.

703
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,827
Nothing to it!

704
00:50:39,202 --> 00:50:42,330
Except it's in a shady place.

705
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:45,674
You'll like the Madame.

706
00:50:46,476 --> 00:50:48,671
Will I like your doll?

707
00:50:51,381 --> 00:50:54,509
Olga's like a little sister to me.

708
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:55,844
Okay, okay, I'll come.

709
00:50:56,787 --> 00:51:00,018
I want oysters, foie gras...

710
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,282
And for the gift: coffee.

711
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,786
Coffee beans... Watch my makeup!

712
00:51:04,995 --> 00:51:06,622
Real coffee.

713
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:09,628
But I warn you: no Germans.
Not at the table.

714
00:51:13,437 --> 00:51:16,634
- It's so Chinese!
- It's oriental.

715
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,469
I asked Reine to accompany me.

716
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:23,305
My seamstress and friend.
Reine Sorignal.

717
00:51:23,513 --> 00:51:26,482
Why, of course.
A friend, Marinette Burguiere.

718
00:51:26,683 --> 00:51:28,480
Come this way...

719
00:51:29,519 --> 00:51:31,817
I'm delighted to have you here, children.

720
00:51:32,022 --> 00:51:33,489
They're just passing through!

721
00:51:40,197 --> 00:51:42,165
We'll go upstairs.

722
00:51:42,365 --> 00:51:43,491
Your Suzanne's a looker.

723
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:45,330
You're quite a couple!

724
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:46,995
Watch the steps.

725
00:51:47,204 --> 00:51:49,331
It's waxed Prussian-style.

726
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,342
Nice!

727
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:57,001
Sorry, it's like a junk shop here.
There's no room.

728
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,176
The table, the statue...

729
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:03,284
I've seen this before... It's magnificent!

730
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:06,281
Oysters! I must be dreaming.

731
00:52:06,990 --> 00:52:08,787
Never too old!

732
00:52:13,997 --> 00:52:17,626
A promise is a promise.
Abyssinian. A good pound.

733
00:52:18,335 --> 00:52:19,962
Thanks so much.

734
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:21,637
Nothing like pre-war coffee.

735
00:52:24,508 --> 00:52:26,476
For you...

736
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,978
They're autographed.

737
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:35,647
Why do you always do period films?
For the gowns?

738
00:52:36,353 --> 00:52:39,151
I don't write my roles. Fortunately.

739
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:42,150
People are scrambling for fabric.

740
00:52:42,359 --> 00:52:45,487
True, fabric is hard to come by.

741
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:49,324
Designers don't have that problem.
They just have to pay.

742
00:52:49,533 --> 00:52:51,000
Money buys everything.

743
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:54,830
A period film's a good medium
for putting ideas across.

744
00:52:55,705 --> 00:53:00,506
Nowadays, any critical allusion to
the army, the church, the family...

745
00:53:00,710 --> 00:53:01,608
The police.

746
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:04,279
The police... It's censored!

747
00:53:05,482 --> 00:53:07,609
In suit and tie, you're a public threat.

748
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:10,445
But say it in a period costume...

749
00:53:10,654 --> 00:53:12,952
Other times, other ways.

750
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:14,054
Cheers!

751
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:14,885
To us!

752
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:17,626
Mouton-Rothschild 1929.
It's not dishwater!

753
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:19,124
You make a lot?

754
00:53:19,496 --> 00:53:21,623
Goodness, yes.

755
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:23,298
How much?

756
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,467
Excuse me?

757
00:53:28,138 --> 00:53:29,571
Sorry. I'm nosey.

758
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:31,297
It's no secret.

759
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:35,634
In a play, I get 4,000 francs
per performance.

760
00:53:35,845 --> 00:53:36,812
Really?

761
00:53:37,013 --> 00:53:41,143
But in a movie, I make up for it.
I can earn 30,000.

762
00:53:41,685 --> 00:53:43,312
That's more like it.

763
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:44,817
How about you?

764
00:53:45,021 --> 00:53:49,151
It's pretty unpredictable with us.
There are ups and downs.

765
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,327
But it takes stamina.

766
00:53:53,363 --> 00:53:56,332
Do you know Mr. Giraudoux?
Jean Giraudoux?

767
00:53:57,033 --> 00:53:59,001
Sure, I know him. By name.

768
00:53:59,202 --> 00:53:59,998
I mean in person.

769
00:54:00,203 --> 00:54:03,434
No. But I think I might, some day.

770
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,107
Juliette, more chestnuts!

771
00:54:05,308 --> 00:54:06,605
I know him.

772
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:11,603
Jean used to take me
to lunch with him at Louvre Hotel.

773
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:13,783
He's really got manners.

774
00:54:13,984 --> 00:54:15,076
And education.

775
00:54:15,652 --> 00:54:16,949
And goodness.

776
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:19,118
He's not paid what he's worth, either.

777
00:54:20,624 --> 00:54:22,114
Some more pheasant, darling?

778
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,126
You look lovely.

779
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,961
Every man for himself and God for me!

780
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:38,341
Juliette will bring cigars and coffee.

781
00:54:38,341 --> 00:54:40,138
You're having fun.

782
00:54:40,343 --> 00:54:42,311
The kid's a gas!
She asked what I earn

783
00:54:42,512 --> 00:54:44,639
on dresses per month. She totted it up

784
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:48,807
and said I'd earn more
with a leather goods shop.

785
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:51,150
You pushing me?

786
00:54:51,855 --> 00:54:53,823
No, you're the one who's pushing.

787
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:58,324
You ask me: "Is Max Ernst is a Jew?"
I answer: "Who gives a damn!"

788
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:00,325
"A great artist?"
Absolutely.

789
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:03,931
"Can one be an artist and a Jew?"
Certainly.

790
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:06,932
"But I won't denounce any."
Then: "Is Celine a great writer?" "Yes!"

791
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:08,931
"You approve his anti-Semitic work?"

792
00:55:09,472 --> 00:55:11,940
"I don't read the rags he writes for."

793
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:16,101
"So, you're a Jew-lover."
Mostly, I've been a Jewess-lover!

794
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,438
I may be drunk, but it won't stop me
from speaking my mind!

795
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,117
He's back again!

796
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:23,445
With his net!

797
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:26,785
- You sure?
- I saw him.

798
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:27,957
Take a look.

799
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,455
He's a bit thick!

800
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:30,626
Dirty creep!

801
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:32,291
Who?

802
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,460
What's this about?

803
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:36,791
It's just Camille.
A guy who catches cats.

804
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:37,728
Cats?

805
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:41,296
What's he do with all those cats?

806
00:55:41,604 --> 00:55:45,131
He skins them or sells them
for food, who knows?

807
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,968
Maybe they served us cat.

808
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:50,146
No, it had feathers.

809
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:52,142
- Calm down.
- I'll punch him out!

810
00:55:52,349 --> 00:55:54,476
I'd warned him.

811
00:55:54,684 --> 00:55:55,981
Nothing's dumber than an anti-Semite!

812
00:55:56,186 --> 00:55:57,813
Listen to yourself!

813
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:05,921
What are they doing?

814
00:56:08,298 --> 00:56:09,424
They're hitting him!

815
00:56:09,966 --> 00:56:11,092
Oh, my God!

816
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,616
Take him away!

817
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,618
Shit, split it again!

818
00:56:33,490 --> 00:56:37,620
You're crazy! He's dangerous.
He's a cop for the Germans.

819
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:40,796
I've wrangled with cops before.

820
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:43,795
Please, Jean, calm down.
Do it for me.

821
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,627
He started, I'll finish.

822
00:56:46,002 --> 00:56:48,630
He's good for the prison infirmary.

823
00:56:48,838 --> 00:56:51,136
I fixed him good.

824
00:56:51,508 --> 00:56:53,635
Beating up a tramp in his 60s...!

825
00:57:00,683 --> 00:57:02,412
He gets this way.

826
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:05,247
He's overworked.
So when he drinks, he collapses.

827
00:57:07,123 --> 00:57:09,591
Mr. Tourneur, could I add...?

828
00:57:15,465 --> 00:57:17,933
- How much time?
- Three minutes.

829
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:20,098
Sure, they're real pearls.

830
00:57:20,470 --> 00:57:22,438
Move the table closer.

831
00:57:28,478 --> 00:57:29,945
There was an extra here.

832
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:31,280
Hear that, Jacques?

833
00:57:31,481 --> 00:57:32,448
Hop to it!

834
00:57:33,650 --> 00:57:35,277
This is take 59?

835
00:57:41,157 --> 00:57:43,455
Don't touch what's on your plate.

836
00:57:43,827 --> 00:57:46,125
- Not even the lettuce.
- The chicken looks yummy.

837
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:48,956
It's not chicken, it's rutabaga.
Like the rest.

838
00:57:49,165 --> 00:57:50,462
Carved. And raw.

839
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:56,468
But we have to look like we're eating.

840
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:59,468
So look like it, without eating.

841
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:00,574
Character acting, right?

842
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:03,238
How low are you framing?

843
00:58:03,446 --> 00:58:04,913
Just under her treasure chest.

844
00:58:05,181 --> 00:58:07,911
- A lot of chest! Get a shawl.
- It's my endowment!

845
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,085
A shawl for the young lady!

846
00:58:13,289 --> 00:58:17,248
You'll be on Ladies' Delight next.

847
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:19,087
- So what?
- I want a part.

848
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:22,093
A real role. No more extra work.

849
00:58:22,298 --> 00:58:24,425
- What's a real role?
- You know.

850
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:27,432
Three scenes with three lines.
For a dozen eggs.

851
00:58:27,637 --> 00:58:30,606
- Eggs aren't rare.
- A rabbit, then.

852
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:32,434
Okay, but with six eggs.

853
00:58:32,642 --> 00:58:35,110
- 6 eggs and half a rabbit.
- The liver included.

854
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:38,772
For tomorrow. I have guests.

855
00:58:40,817 --> 00:58:42,614
Mr. Fresnay, on the set!

856
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:43,786
Mr. Fresnay's right here!

857
00:58:43,987 --> 00:58:47,616
Mr. Fresnay's on the set, always ready!

858
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:51,961
Lift your boom when the kid exits.

859
00:58:52,395 --> 00:58:54,454
You bet! We'll lift it.

860
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,458
Ready, ladies and gents?

861
00:59:02,105 --> 00:59:04,232
Care to see the set-up, sir?

862
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:07,737
What's with gramps?

863
00:59:10,680 --> 00:59:13,080
We're going to shoot!

864
00:59:21,791 --> 00:59:25,750
My wife's been incarcerated
by the police in Vittel.

865
00:59:26,596 --> 00:59:29,588
She still has a US passport.
She's American. I'm worried.

866
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:31,432
I understand, sir.

867
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:35,434
My mind's not on this.
So if you'd fill in for me...

868
00:59:35,638 --> 00:59:37,435
Count on me, sir.

869
00:59:48,985 --> 00:59:51,112
Go to it, fella. We're behind you.

870
00:59:51,988 --> 00:59:54,786
Okay. The camera goes here, with a 35.

871
00:59:57,827 --> 01:00:01,285
At first, we don't see Mr. Larquey,
only his shadow.

872
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,458
His name is Angel.
I want a strange, eerie effect.

873
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:11,803
You'll have it, sir.

874
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:20,311
Rehearsal. Silence.

875
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:54,072
Don't wrinkle my tie!

876
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:56,348
It's a bad idea.

877
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:00,852
- It's like a wax museum.
- No, you'll see.

878
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:08,793
There's no mystery.
We have to imagine the hand.

879
01:01:09,232 --> 01:01:11,132
If it doesn't work, we cut it.

880
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,131
This will go great guns, fellas!

881
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,803
We'll see!

882
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:18,470
Thanks for my script.

883
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,972
What about it?

884
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:22,974
For backing it against Clouzot's.
Thanks!

885
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,806
Yours was shorter.

886
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:29,811
I'm not a philanthropist.

887
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:31,714
So we'll make a little deal.

888
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:34,323
Today, one cent.
Tomorrow, two cents...

889
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:36,992
It gives you time to make a decision.

890
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,487
8 cents, 16 cents, 32, 64, 128,

891
01:01:39,762 --> 01:01:41,491
256, 512, 1024...

892
01:01:41,698 --> 01:01:42,995
Doubling it to infinity.

893
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,161
You know what infinity's like?

894
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:49,433
I know. I've been there.
It's quite nice.

895
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:51,669
Cut!

896
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:56,675
Not only great guns, but howitzers!

897
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:15,790
I'll lead the way.

898
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:19,631
Don't buy it, mister, don't buy it!

899
01:02:20,169 --> 01:02:21,796
Quiet! You sorcerer!

900
01:02:23,172 --> 01:02:24,469
And the shadows, sir?

901
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:27,802
His name's Angel so he thinks
he's everyone's guardian.

902
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,004
It's very good.

903
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:33,978
I couldn't have done better.

904
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:35,309
Thank you.

905
01:02:40,022 --> 01:02:42,320
- You believe in that?
- Why shouldn't I?

906
01:02:44,861 --> 01:02:46,488
But it's impossible.

907
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:49,824
You have no valid reason to refuse.

908
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:53,669
I do! I'm under contract.
I'm tied up until Jan. '43.

909
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:57,829
Predated contracts
which arrived just in time!

910
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:00,166
That's all right. Eat! Drink!

911
01:03:01,144 --> 01:03:03,612
I choose good subjects,
3 times out of 5.

912
01:03:03,813 --> 01:03:07,772
I don't make films in Germany.
I leave our propaganda to the French.

913
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:11,283
Vichy censorship can't touch us
and I pay the best.

914
01:03:11,654 --> 01:03:14,452
- What more do you want?
- I don't know.

915
01:03:14,824 --> 01:03:16,451
Isn't it a bit too salty?

916
01:03:16,826 --> 01:03:19,124
Salt always hides something.

917
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:21,125
Ever since the Middle Ages.

918
01:03:21,497 --> 01:03:22,691
Forget the Middle Ages, Aurenche.

919
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:24,958
It's salted just right.

920
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:28,137
Hire Prevert.
Hire Jeanson, Very, Laroche...

921
01:03:29,172 --> 01:03:31,140
Jeanson was denounced by the French.

922
01:03:31,674 --> 01:03:33,972
And the others tell me, "Hire Aurenche."

923
01:03:38,014 --> 01:03:39,311
Spaak!

924
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:43,750
Hello, Dr. Greven.

925
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:45,987
Tell him to work for me, Spaak.

926
01:03:46,189 --> 01:03:47,486
Tell him I'm no ogre.

927
01:03:49,692 --> 01:03:52,661
Odette Joyeux is raving
about Love Letters.

928
01:03:52,862 --> 01:03:54,329
Thanks. How about you?

929
01:03:54,597 --> 01:03:56,656
I have my ups and downs.

930
01:03:58,367 --> 01:04:01,598
He's not afraid to work for me.
He's finishing a film

931
01:04:01,804 --> 01:04:04,432
and he's signed to do
a Simenon, a Maigret.

932
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:07,442
Give him my two films then.

933
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:11,945
He doesn't have that French light touch.

934
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:15,443
You have it. I want to make
lots of good films.

935
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:18,787
Better than the Americans.
So I need good scripts,

936
01:04:19,488 --> 01:04:22,286
- Hence, good scriptwriters.
- Take your pick.

937
01:04:22,558 --> 01:04:25,118
There's nothing to pick.
And you know why?

938
01:04:25,561 --> 01:04:30,123
No more Jews. Not in Germany,
not here. The best writers

939
01:04:30,333 --> 01:04:32,961
were Jews. Natanson, Andre Lang,
Pierre Wolff. All gone!

940
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:36,470
If you know any, send them over.

941
01:04:38,341 --> 01:04:39,808
Mr. Greven,

942
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:42,136
even if I knew any, think I'd tell you?

943
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:45,304
Know what you risk
talking to me like that?

944
01:04:45,848 --> 01:04:47,975
I could send you to Germany tomorrow.

945
01:04:48,517 --> 01:04:51,315
Sure... If I were a laborer

946
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:53,647
or maitre d', I'd answer differently.

947
01:04:54,023 --> 01:04:57,481
But we're 2 bourgeois. I'm poorer,
but still a bourgeois.

948
01:04:57,860 --> 01:04:59,327
We're two of a kind.

949
01:05:02,798 --> 01:05:05,767
I have a Jew at Continental.
And communist, too.

950
01:05:05,968 --> 01:05:08,061
I know it. He doesn't know I know.

951
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:12,270
Just one film, Aurenche. A comedy.

952
01:05:12,642 --> 01:05:13,768
You know how to write gags.

953
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:18,109
I'll have Fernandel in 3 months.
He'll direct.

954
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,775
It's called Adrien.
A Jean de Letraz hit.

955
01:05:21,817 --> 01:05:24,945
But those kind of plays...

956
01:05:25,955 --> 01:05:27,786
Just what I loathe.

957
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:30,285
As for Fernandel...

958
01:05:30,493 --> 01:05:33,291
He's a gag factory, a walking gag.

959
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:36,965
Where would I fit in? I'd ruin it all.

960
01:05:58,187 --> 01:05:59,313
Rene!

961
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,413
Rene Wheeler!

962
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,586
Selling shoelaces?

963
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:09,424
Not by choice. I have to eat.

964
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:12,259
I don't sell any so I don't eat.

965
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:19,604
I just turned down a film.
A piece of crap.

966
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:22,937
I can accept it for you.
You write and collect.

967
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,773
There are bad points.
Director and star: Fernandel.

968
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:28,610
For Continental, the Fritz.

969
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:30,950
Eat with the devil, at least you eat.

970
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:35,620
Is that cop here to monitor the gags?

971
01:06:37,326 --> 01:06:40,625
I've had this idea
I wanted to do with you.

972
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:43,298
A story about river poachers.

973
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:45,630
A totally free narrative.

974
01:06:46,435 --> 01:06:48,801
- Shot entirely on location.
- Which region?

975
01:06:49,105 --> 01:06:50,970
The Rhone. Simple people.

976
01:06:51,173 --> 01:06:53,801
Anarchists, extravagant as we like them.

977
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:56,641
Well, Aurenche!

978
01:06:57,246 --> 01:07:00,147
I'm not fickle, but when I left...

979
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,074
You know what Napoleon said?

980
01:07:02,284 --> 01:07:06,744
Rene Wheeler, a first-class writer.
Take him and we'll be a team.

981
01:07:07,289 --> 01:07:09,257
What did our friend Napoleon say?

982
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:13,083
It'll come back to me.
Rene's free as of now...

983
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:16,594
He knows it's Fernandel in front
and behind the camera.

984
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:19,927
Fernandel's ideas, gags, the works.

985
01:07:20,469 --> 01:07:23,097
He talks so I'll say yes
without thinking.

986
01:07:23,305 --> 01:07:25,273
But still, I'm thinking.

987
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,436
And I say yes anyway.

988
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:30,438
Go up and see Marcel Bryau,

989
01:07:30,646 --> 01:07:31,943
who's in charge of contracts.

990
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:34,875
Don't go. I'll see you in a minute.

991
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:40,945
"Patience and time
accomplish more than force and rage."

992
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:42,283
That's it.

993
01:07:42,491 --> 01:07:43,458
Have a good day.

994
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:45,286
Come along.

995
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:50,624
So it's Fernandel.

996
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,301
Your timing of the Tourneur film
was perfect!

997
01:07:55,037 --> 01:07:57,631
Only a 17-second difference
with the final cut.

998
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:02,068
Do the same on Ladies' Delight.
You'll work with Cayatte.

999
01:08:05,614 --> 01:08:08,310
The Military Cross?
And the stars are citations?

1000
01:08:09,452 --> 01:08:10,749
You were an officer?

1001
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:14,252
Cavalry lieutenant, transferred
to a reconnaissance group.

1002
01:08:16,625 --> 01:08:19,753
But what happened to you French?
This whole debacle!

1003
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:23,420
In '14 you held firm.
I fought you, you had courage!

1004
01:08:23,632 --> 01:08:26,260
But now, why this beating? Why so fast?

1005
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:32,596
Fine. I have one, too.
I was a fighter pilot.

1006
01:08:36,145 --> 01:08:38,113
Power shortage.
Take 2 extra nights.

1007
01:08:38,314 --> 01:08:40,441
Cayatte lacks experience. You have it.

1008
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:44,152
Show him where the camera goes.

1009
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:45,517
It's freezing!

1010
01:08:48,657 --> 01:08:50,625
The young lady there...

1011
01:08:50,993 --> 01:08:52,961
That's a projector, not a foot-warmer.

1012
01:08:58,167 --> 01:09:00,135
Put a scrim on that projector.

1013
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:07,576
The two girls on the left...

1014
01:09:07,943 --> 01:09:09,570
The lady in the brown coat,

1015
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:12,713
move to the left. The other lady, too.
My left.

1016
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:13,906
Not your left.

1017
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:16,911
You're holding me up.
I'm going to work.

1018
01:09:17,119 --> 01:09:18,916
- Ausweiss, please!
- What ausweiss?

1019
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:20,418
Your pass.

1020
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:24,915
You have my ID. My papers are in order.
Tell them!

1021
01:09:25,127 --> 01:09:27,186
It's curfew. You need ausweiss.

1022
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:30,763
I'm an extra! Over there.
Ladies' Delight! Extra!

1023
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:36,437
Me, movies, Continental, studio!

1024
01:09:36,972 --> 01:09:39,270
Continental is you! It's German!

1025
01:09:41,610 --> 01:09:43,771
- Tract!
- That's nothing...

1026
01:09:44,146 --> 01:09:45,613
I found it on the ground!

1027
01:09:47,483 --> 01:09:50,782
I'm gonna make a stink!
I know the director!

1028
01:09:51,153 --> 01:09:54,782
And I work for you!
Continental is German, it's you!

1029
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:58,953
I'm cold and hungry!

1030
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:00,991
I have fish bone paste.

1031
01:10:02,398 --> 01:10:03,626
They're coming!

1032
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:05,993
- Butts!
- What a waste!

1033
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:15,709
Quiet on the set!

1034
01:10:18,180 --> 01:10:19,977
Ready, everybody?

1035
01:10:20,182 --> 01:10:21,479
Ready, Michel?

1036
01:10:22,251 --> 01:10:23,309
Let's do it.

1037
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,316
- A chair?
- No, thank you.

1038
01:10:25,521 --> 01:10:27,148
Do you need anything?

1039
01:10:32,294 --> 01:10:34,819
Ladies' Delight. Scene 248, take 1!

1040
01:10:35,364 --> 01:10:36,331
Action!

1041
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:40,826
Take your money back.
Baudu doesn't accept charity.

1042
01:10:41,203 --> 01:10:43,000
You ruined me,

1043
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:45,673
but you won't last. You've created

1044
01:10:45,874 --> 01:10:48,502
a mastrous monchine... Shit!

1045
01:10:48,711 --> 01:10:49,507
Cut!

1046
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:52,010
"A monstrous machine"!

1047
01:10:52,815 --> 01:10:55,010
This was written by a mindless midget.

1048
01:10:56,719 --> 01:10:59,017
- Stay in your places.
- I'm in my place!

1049
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:02,623
- It's okay, Michel.
- Bug off!

1050
01:11:03,325 --> 01:11:04,792
Silence!

1051
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,462
Hammers!

1052
01:11:09,498 --> 01:11:11,295
Maybe there's no director!

1053
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:14,629
Watch your manners!

1054
01:11:16,839 --> 01:11:18,636
- Water for Mr. Simon.
- Which take?

1055
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:20,968
- Sixth.
- Bad times in Billancourt!

1056
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:25,146
In 20 years, trade will be
one big battlefield,

1057
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:28,809
on which quality,
probity and confidence

1058
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:31,316
will be sacrificed. Beware, Mouret!

1059
01:11:31,687 --> 01:11:34,656
You're inaugurating a reign
of junk and razzle-dazzle.

1060
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,988
There's a price that you, too...

1061
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:40,828
that you too, one day...

1062
01:11:41,297 --> 01:11:43,162
What? "You, too, one day..." What!

1063
01:11:43,532 --> 01:11:44,829
I can't do it!

1064
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:47,502
I can't go on playing
with watchdogs around.

1065
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:58,679
Take a 3-minute break.

1066
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,449
Reload!

1067
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:08,123
Michel's a pain, but what balls!

1068
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,293
Swiss balls! Safer than Gallic ones.
Neutral balls!

1069
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:35,150
It's going to be hell!

1070
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:38,812
Machine guns and anti-aircraft guns.
We'll go nuts!

1071
01:12:39,955 --> 01:12:42,822
- Go to my godmother.
- They won't shoot all day.

1072
01:12:43,192 --> 01:12:44,489
Where'd you get this?

1073
01:12:45,194 --> 01:12:48,493
The dairywoman.
I hired her daughter as an extra.

1074
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:49,994
Can the baby eat it?

1075
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:53,327
Sure, sure.

1076
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,842
As for us... the crust is good.

1077
01:13:03,479 --> 01:13:04,605
Your brother gets my goat.

1078
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:08,450
He only comes to pick up girls.

1079
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:10,611
But tonight, absent for duty.

1080
01:13:11,153 --> 01:13:12,279
What do you mean?

1081
01:13:12,654 --> 01:13:13,951
He never showed up.

1082
01:13:14,156 --> 01:13:17,785
I found him work as an extra.
But him...

1083
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:21,959
He'll get packed off to Germany,
like my brother.

1084
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:24,799
Except that he got squealed on.

1085
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,636
It's been a while.

1086
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:49,483
It's every day now.

1087
01:13:49,691 --> 01:13:51,818
Air raids all the time!
Your Brits are a pain!

1088
01:13:52,027 --> 01:13:54,996
And always the same targets
Renault, Salmson, Sauter.

1089
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:58,325
So long, Billancourt!
I'm moving to Rue St. Charles.

1090
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:02,930
But that's right where Citroen is!

1091
01:14:03,138 --> 01:14:06,266
So? They'd never bomb Citroen.
Citroen is all Jews.

1092
01:14:09,311 --> 01:14:11,279
- Mr. Raoul!
- This isn't bad.

1093
01:14:16,151 --> 01:14:19,120
More of that gutless literature.
My hat's no trash can!

1094
01:14:19,488 --> 01:14:21,615
Rehearsal, gentlemen!

1095
01:14:21,990 --> 01:14:23,617
I dare you to repeat that.

1096
01:14:23,992 --> 01:14:28,497
What you call my tomahawk pin
is Petain's francisque. I'm proud of it!

1097
01:14:28,497 --> 01:14:30,465
But you still kiss Kraut ass!

1098
01:14:30,666 --> 01:14:33,965
I fought them but I respect
the victors.

1099
01:14:34,336 --> 01:14:36,304
- "And I inform."
- What nerve!

1100
01:14:36,839 --> 01:14:39,137
Hands off! I'll denounce you!

1101
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:41,967
Mr. Aimable!

1102
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:46,643
You're behind on the set construction.

1103
01:14:46,849 --> 01:14:48,817
Let me show you why.

1104
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:01,261
Coffins?

1105
01:15:01,463 --> 01:15:03,431
The wood for our sets. Requisitioned.

1106
01:15:04,132 --> 01:15:06,259
It's in great demand
on the Russian front.

1107
01:15:06,969 --> 01:15:09,437
That's furniture for the Atlantic Wall.

1108
01:15:09,805 --> 01:15:11,773
The studio head sells to the Krauts.

1109
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:14,442
No profit is too small.

1110
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:18,947
To make household savings,
use everything.

1111
01:15:19,815 --> 01:15:22,113
Let nothing go to waste...

1112
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:26,949
Mom, what're you doing here?

1113
01:15:27,155 --> 01:15:28,622
Simone got a summons.

1114
01:15:29,992 --> 01:15:32,460
- Summons?
- I came to watch the baby.

1115
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:35,964
- Summoned by whom?
- How should I know?

1116
01:15:36,164 --> 01:15:38,962
You know Simone. She called,
showed me a paper when I got here,

1117
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:43,126
- And said: "I'm going to Fresnes."
- The prison! I'm going.

1118
01:15:43,338 --> 01:15:44,965
You're crazy!

1119
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:47,301
Try the police first.

1120
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:51,645
It must be those shoe coupons.
They looked shady to me.

1121
01:15:52,114 --> 01:15:54,480
She got them from her father.

1122
01:15:56,685 --> 01:15:58,585
Those shoes were trash...

1123
01:15:59,187 --> 01:16:00,814
Wood and cardboard.

1124
01:16:01,023 --> 01:16:03,253
Let the time go by

1125
01:16:04,793 --> 01:16:06,920
Let the days go past

1126
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:10,931
Let the wind blow high

1127
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:14,762
but make sure love stands fast...

1128
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:34,615
Strange place to meet.

1129
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:36,951
There's safety in numbers.

1130
01:16:38,327 --> 01:16:39,453
You wanted to see me?

1131
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:41,458
I'm worried.

1132
01:16:41,930 --> 01:16:45,127
Simone got a summons.
I asked the police. No news.

1133
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:46,966
Who summoned her? Where?

1134
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:49,634
I don't know. But she's at Fresnes.

1135
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:51,804
I'll ask around.

1136
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:54,976
Continental's no protection.
This proves it.

1137
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:58,146
That's irrelevant.
She works at Sirius Distribution.

1138
01:16:59,681 --> 01:17:01,410
If we got her out...

1139
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:05,082
Our job is intelligence, infiltration,
not playing commandos.
