1
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,232
Forasmuch as it has pleased
Almighty God of his great mercy,

2
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:23,559
to take unto himself the soul
of our dear brother here departed...

3
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:27,353
...we therefore commit his body
to the ground...

4
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:30,271
...earth to earth,

5
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,271
ashes to ashes...

6
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,152
...dust to dust.

8
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,309
So sorry, my dear Mrs Henderson.

9
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,113
Your husband
was a great friend to my country.

10
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,673
<i>That's so kind of you.</i>

11
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,871
Please join us at the house
for a small luncheon in his honour.

12
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:18,595
Thank you so much, Leslie...
but I think I'll take my own car.

13
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,791
Madam.

14
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:16,033
I know that Robert would want me to be
available to help you in any way.

15
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,991
Thank you so much.

16
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:25,194
- He was an estimable man.
- Yes. Yes.

17
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:27,435
And a very dangerous
business competitor.

18
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,833
Yes.

19
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,751
Oh. Please.

20
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,431
Excuse me.

21
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,751
I am bored with widowhood.

22
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,870
My dear,
you've just scratched the surface.

23
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,388
I have to smile at everybody.
I've never had to do that.

24
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,749
In India, there were always people
to look down on.

25
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:50,519
People are simply being sympathetic.

26
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,835
After all, you have lost your husband.

27
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,154
<i>I didn't mislay him.</i>

28
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,668
It was most inconsiderate
of Robert to die.

29
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,314
What on earth
am I supposed to do now?

30
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,351
The first rule of widowhood, my dear -

31
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,597
important conversations occur at lunch.

32
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,437
<i>It's really not so bad.</i>

33
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,755
Widows are allowed hobbies.

34
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,472
- Hobbies?
- Yes.

35
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,353
- Embroidery. Things like that.
- Are you mad?

36
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,152
I graduated to weaving.

37
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,237
<i>- Would you care to see my tapestries?
- I'd rather drink ink.</i>

38
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,555
Committees are good, of course.

39
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,039
I serve on quite a few.

40
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:24,195
Charities.

41
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,552
<i>Once your husband dies,
it's quite permissible to help the poor.</i>

42
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,079
<i>And now there's no-one
to stop you buying things.</i>

43
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,438
<i>Also, of course, there's
a great deal of time for lovers.</i>

44
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:41,552
<i>- Margot, I'm nearly 70.
- That's true.</i>

45
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,636
But you're also very rich.

46
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,438
The one cancels out the other.

47
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,319
<i>I don't know anything
about embroidery.</i>

48
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,997
Ow! Oh!

49
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:10,352
Now, I believe we may call it a refuge.

50
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,837
Certainly we do not want any term
alluding to unwed mothers in the title.

51
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:19,393
Nor do we wish for the public to know
the purpose of the house.

52
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,795
<i>But I've told all my friends I'm helping
to build a home for future bastards.</i>

53
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,399
Sorry.

54
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,351
<i>- Home, madam?
- I need some fresh air. Let's drive.</i>

55
00:09:10,452 --> 00:09:12,952
Yes, madam.

56
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,552
I think I should see Alec.

57
00:09:22,653 --> 00:09:27,253
Hello, Alec.

58
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,231
<i>Let's return to London, please.</i>

59
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,391
<i>I'd rather like to visit
old Windmill Street again.</i>

60
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,798
Good day, madam.

61
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,071
Oh.

62
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:45,871
- Mind your back.
- Oh!

63
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,189
- Oh, Laura, what on earth?
- Margo.

64
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,117
Renovations, dear.

65
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,515
<i>- But it's a...
- Theatre.</i>

66
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:57,676
<i>It's a theatre. Isn't it delicious?</i>

67
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:58,914
- I own it.
- Own it?

68
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,753
You told me now there was no-one
to stop me from buying things,

69
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,119
so I bought a theatre.

70
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,311
I meant bracelets and earrings.

71
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,989
What on earth are you going to do
with a theatre?

72
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:14,670
Well, I thought music hall, or - what do
they call it in America - vaudeville?

73
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,356
<i>Actually, I haven't thought about it.</i>

74
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,118
Oh, dear.
What am I going to do with it?

75
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,515
Clearly you need someone
to run it for you.

76
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,794
Oh, you think?

77
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:26,070
<i>Oh, I knew you'd give me
sensible advice.</i>

78
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,675
But who?

79
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,437
<i>Well, that's an easy assignment.
I know just the man.</i>

80
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,271
<i>He's out of work at the moment,
but he's very good at running theatres.</i>

81
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,151
<i>I can't imagine where she is.</i>

82
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,310
She was meant to be here
20 minutes ago.

83
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,871
Well...

84
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,279
<i>...that's that, then.</i>

85
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,676
<i>I can't hang around here all morning.
I've an important meeting to go to.</i>

86
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,639
<i>- I'm sorry, old chum...
- Oh, he was terribly ill in the car.</i>

87
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,955
Nerves, I imagine. Little sweet!

88
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,230
Hello, Leslie.
- Hello.

89
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,479
Whoon earth are you?

90
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,398
<i>- This is Vivian Van Damm.
- Don't be silly.</i>

91
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,158
<i>That's not a British name.</i>

92
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,590
<i>In actual fact,
my father's a lawyer in Bishopsgate.</i>

93
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,837
Although some of his ancestors
are from Holland.

94
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,394
<i>- Oh, dear God, you're Jewish!
- As it happens, I'm not.</i>

95
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,908
Well, of course you are, dear.
Just look at yourself.

96
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:23,919
<i>The show business is filled with Jewish
people, isn't it? One must make do.</i>

97
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,837
<i>We haven't met. I'm Laura Henderson.</i>

98
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:27,757
Yes, I imagined you were.

99
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,792
You're 20 minutes late,
and you're rude.

100
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,710
<i>- Perhaps he's the wrong man.
- No, I don't think so.</i>

101
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,671
Where are you going?

102
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,880
Leslie, where is he off to? Do stop him.

103
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,831
<i>I'm here tooffer you a position!</i>

104
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:46,872
<i>You can't offer me a position
if I'm walking out on you.</i>

105
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,876
<i>But that's why I'm offering it, dear.</i>

106
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,558
You've got gumption.

107
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:52,272
<i>Oh, don't you adore that word?</i>

108
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,197
And you're smoking a cigar.

109
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,674
Anyone who runs my theatre
must smoke a cigar.

110
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,392
<i>It's so manly. And so...</i>

111
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,589
What?

112
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,555
Jewish.

113
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,631
I have a theatre.

114
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:10,990
I have a theatre.

115
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:16,835
<i>It's just sitting there,
waiting for a brilliant manager</i>

116
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,394
to come and turn it into
a commercial proposition.

117
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,954
A manager who might bring
some enjoyment and amusement

118
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,553
back into the West End.

119
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,909
A manager with vision and courage.

120
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,039
<i>And if that isn't you,
then my intuition has failed me.</i>

121
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,789
So, by all means, hurry off,
Mr Damm Van.

122
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,159
Van Damm.

123
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,273
Oh, if you insist, dear. If you insist.

124
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,871
Whose idea was it to gut the building?

125
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,429
- Mine.
- Well, well.

126
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,754
There should be a sign saying
Windmill Theatre. Up there. See?

127
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,279
You're going to retain the name?

128
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,716
Well, I find it helps your driver
if the theatre is named after the street.

129
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,149
What do you know
about the theatre business?

130
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,189
Almost nothing.

131
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,990
I have to have total control
of the production side. Is that clear?

132
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,753
All artistic decisions are mine.

133
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,429
You may voice an opinion, if you must,
but I have the final say.

134
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,391
- Understood?
- Of course.

135
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,079
I think we'll make a splendid team.

136
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,315
<i>Let's go and sit down
in that charming little café.</i>

137
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,909
<i>I'm sure its business will improve
when our musical revue opens.</i>

138
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,074
Who said we were doing
a musical revue?

139
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,473
Well, I assumed.

140
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:37,353
All those decisions are mine.
Remember?

141
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,994
<i>That's perfect. Just there.</i>

142
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,951
Higher.

143
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,958
No. No, no, no. Come back.
Come back to the middle.

144
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,433
Higher.

145
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,269
Higher.

146
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,118
<i>Fine. I've had an idea. Let's go inside.</i>

147
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:02,751
It is a radical idea.

148
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,557
Oh, jolly good. What is it?

149
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,591
Non-stop performances.

150
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,656
- Non-stop?
- Yes.

151
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,396
Instead of two shows a day,
we run our show all day long.

152
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,210
Five or six performances a day,
one after another.

153
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:20,872
<i>It's never been done in England before.</i>

154
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,275
Every theatre here
is exactly like every other theatre.

155
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:25,709
No-one is attempting anything new.

156
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,438
<i>It's good to stir things up,
don't you think?</i>

157
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:29,954
<i>We'd be a sensation.</i>

158
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:33,117
I've no idea what you're on about,
but I do admire passion.

159
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:36,031
Yes, well... what else is there?

160
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:39,868
How much will this experiment cost?

161
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,274
I mean,
what do I stand to lose if it fails?

162
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:45,533
Well, anything up to er... £10,000.

163
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:50,312
What fun!

164
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,633
<i>I'm in a sporting mood today,
Mr Van Damm. It must be the weather.</i>

165
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,233
- And what'll we do?
- A musical revue.

166
00:15:59,080 --> 00:16:00,353
What will we call it?

167
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,311
Well, I thought Revudeville.

168
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,271
Oh, yes!

169
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,173
<i>That's lovely.</i>

170
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,313
Ladies and gentlemen...

171
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,794
...I've invited you here this evening
to sip a bit of sherry -

172
00:16:18,340 --> 00:16:20,991
<i>I'm told cocktail parties
are out-of-date -</i>

173
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:24,578
and to announce
the most amusing news.

174
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:28,813
The Windmill Theatre
will open on February 3rd,

175
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,288
with the most revolutionary programme
ever seen in England.

176
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:37,889
In this enterprise, I shall be carrying on
the work of my late husband,

177
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:41,979
who spent a great deal of time
and money helping stage people,

178
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,470
especially those in the field of variety.

179
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,094
<i>- Is that true?
- She's making it up.</i>

180
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,829
Oh.

181
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,652
As you well know,
these are difficult times,

182
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,370
so many of our delightful
variety performers

183
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,423
have been forced onto the milk line.

184
00:16:54,570 --> 00:16:56,645
<i>- Bread line.
- Bread line. Bread line.</i>

185
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,349
Revudeville is an attempt to create...

186
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,389
- Employment.
... employment.

187
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,761
Employment...
for these delightful creatures.

188
00:17:06,210 --> 00:17:09,826
Our productions will be guided
and overseen by our resident genius,

189
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:14,320
Our brilliant general manager,
who comes to us from Central Europe,

190
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:16,567
Mr Vivian Van Damm.

191
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:24,582
<i>We won't be able to work together,
you know that.</i>

192
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:26,469
You're a perfect match.

193
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:32,818
So, you found yourself a continental.

194
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:36,545
<i>Nonsense. He's as English as you or I.</i>

195
00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:38,825
<i>But he's terribly alive, don't you think?
It's just something one can sense.</i>

196
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:43,219
<i>- Laura, you have an infatuation.
- Oh, don't be ridiculous.</i>

197
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,242
<i>It's the show business I'm attracted to.</i>

198
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:49,385
<i>Tomorrow we have auditions!
Isn't that exciting?</i>

199
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,298
People come in and entertain us

200
00:17:51,490 --> 00:17:53,429
and we say either
"stick around" or "buzz off. "

201
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,766
- Thank you, that'll do.
Poor thing.

202
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:05,482
- Next!
- My dear, would you wait over there?

203
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:11,146
Mr Van Damm, I spent many years
in the Far East with my husband

204
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:13,765
witnessing what one might call
pagan rituals,

205
00:19:13,110 --> 00:19:15,409
but I've never seen anything
as barbaric as this.

206
00:19:15,550 --> 00:19:16,962
Welcome to the theatre.

207
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,888
Next!
Very nice, dear.

208
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:22,649
Buy yourself a decent meal.

209
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,126
<i>Who's the young man at the back?</i>

210
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,188
Ssh! Concentrate on the auditions.

211
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,632
We'll have him.

212
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,749
We will?

213
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,235
We will.

214
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,393
Next!

215
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,031
Why do you keep looking at that boy?

216
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:10,516
That boy, as you call him,
was the featured performer at the Pavilion.

217
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,073
We snatched him away.

218
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:16,033
<i>He can be a big help to me.
He's got excellent taste.</i>

219
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,514
He seems to agree
with all of my choices.

220
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:20,278
Including these
demented pharaohs?

221
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,912
- Book them.
- Right, VD.

222
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,109
Are you mad?

223
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,037
They're not in the least authentic.

224
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:44,953
And over, over,
step, shuffle, change. Riff, pick up, toe.

225
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,514
Pick up and five, six, seven, eight.

226
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,835
Pick up, pick up, pick up, pick up again.

227
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,393
Maxie Ford and heads up.

228
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:54,398
Thank you,
ladies. Change over. Quickly, girls!

229
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,829
See what they're like
from the back of the stalls.

230
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,672
Pay attention to their height.

231
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:02,390
And over. Step, shuffle and change.

232
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,799
Riff, pick up, toe.

233
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,673
Tap, tap, change, pick up, step,
and round, two, three, four.

234
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,075
Pick up, step, pick up, step,
pick up and change.

235
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,838
Maxie Ford and heads up.

236
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,552
Do you find these women attractive?

237
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,478
- Some of them are very pretty.
- Oh, yes, I can certainly see that.

238
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,637
But... do they intrigue you as a man?

239
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,353
- I have other inclinations.
- Oh.

240
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,278
Oh! Oh, how delicious!

241
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,431
And use your backs.

242
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,835
Yes, girls. Next group.

243
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,031
And use your back, girls.

244
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,712
Yes! Last group.

245
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:45,594
<i>But Mr Van Damm seems to have
an intense appreciation, doesn't he?</i>

246
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:48,240
Other girls, ready. And!

247
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,231
<i>He's practically sniffing them.</i>

248
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,872
And last group.

249
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:58,034
- Some of these girls are very good.
- Indeed.

250
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:01,231
<i>I'm going to call our chorus
The Millerettes.</i>

251
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,510
- Millerettes?
- Mill, as in Windmill.

252
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,913
<i>- What's the "er" for?
- What?</i>

253
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,076
Millerettes. It should be Millettes.

254
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,314
<i>The "er" clogs it up.</i>

255
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,510
<i>- Millettes doesn't scan.
- But it's accurate.</i>

256
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:11,879
<i>It doesn't sound right.</i>

257
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,718
Millerettes sounds like a man
named Miller has a chorus line.

258
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:16,751
We're doing a vaudeville,
not a dictionary.

259
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:17,994
<i>It isn't correct English!</i>

260
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,634
<i>Millerettes is a good name.
And it's not your decision.</i>

261
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:22,477
<i>In fact, it's got nothing to do with you.</i>

262
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:25,358
<i>In fact, you shouldn't be in the theatre
until dress rehearsal.</i>

263
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,556
<i>- In fact, I'm going to ban you!
- Don't you dare!</i>

264
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,273
<i>- I'm banning you from all auditions.
- You haven't the right.</i>

265
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:32,834
- I can do anything I please.
- I shall cancel the opening.

266
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,909
Fine!

267
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,190
- This show will not goon!
- Indeed.

268
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,356
They're ready to start again, VD.

269
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,557
My dear, you must never interrupt
a perfectly good argument.

270
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,590
- I've lost my train of thought.
- So have I.

271
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,153
<i>Come on.
Mustn't keep The Millerettes waiting.</i>

272
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,753
<i>Oh, that name's intolerable.</i>

273
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,916
It suggests midgets
working in a factory.

274
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,394
Millettes sounds like
a medical condition.

275
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:53,476
Thank you, Mr Van Damm.

276
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,074
Thank you, Mrs Henderson.

277
00:23:57,040 --> 00:24:00,191
<i>Stop thanking each other.
Let's find some champagne.</i>

278
00:24:01,160 --> 00:24:03,071
Oh, what a wonderful hobby, my dear.

279
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,720
I wonder if there are
any more theatres for sale.

280
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:26,710
<i>I don't understand.
We were such a success.</i>

281
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,751
And then everyone copied us.

282
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,473
<i>- You're telling me we're a disaster?
- Here's the accounts.</i>

283
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:33,192
You're losing a fortune.

284
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:36,232
You mean you can be a triumph
one week and a disaster the next?

285
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:38,271
<i>I'm not certain it's worth going on.</i>

286
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,595
Oh, you people make me weary!

287
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,198
You've no courage.

288
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,834
What I say is, stick a thing out
and it will come right.

289
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,871
<i>I'm trying to save your finances.</i>

290
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:49,753
<i>I don't need your protection,
thank you very much.</i>

291
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,712
We've put on good shows, but they're
obviously not daring enough.

292
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,352
<i>Why don't we get rid of the clothes?</i>

293
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,515
Pardon?

294
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,471
<i>Let's have naked girls.</i>

295
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,073
<i>Don't you think?</i>

296
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,190
Now, this has been on my mind
for some time.

297
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:07,198
I never dared mention it.
I too lack courage, it seems.

298
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:10,238
Now, what I propose is that we have
nude women in Revudeville.

299
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,679
As they do in Paris.

300
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,915
At our namesake, the Moulin Rouge,
for instance.

301
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,798
Oh, Baby, we'll find you some milk.

302
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:21,191
Paris, after all, is just filled with
naked women wearing bananas,

303
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:23,879
and dare I say, making everyone else
go bananas in return.

304
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,354
- Do keep up, Mr Van Damm.
- Yes.

305
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,436
It would be innovative
and draw the crowds.

306
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,118
I would make back all of my money.

307
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,630
You, I imagine, would enjoy yourself,
being surrounded by countless breasts,

308
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,557
<i>and we'd all be happy.</i>

309
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,711
<i>What you're suggesting
isn't possible.</i>

310
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,671
<i>That kind of thing
isn't done here.</i>

311
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:42,153
Nudity? In England?

312
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,800
You tend towards safety sometimes,
Mr Van Damm.

313
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,512
You're rather bourgeois.

314
00:25:46,560 --> 00:25:47,993
I do mean that in a kind way.

315
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:50,793
<i>But I suspect it's not advisable
in the show business.</i>

316
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:55,150
What you're forgetting is we need
a licence from the Lord Chamberlain

317
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:57,760
for whatever we put on the stage.
He'll never approve it.

318
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,189
- The Lord Chamberlain?
- Yes, The Lord Chamberlain.

319
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:03,431
<i>What, Tommy? Little Tommy Baring?
Oh, don't be silly!</i>

320
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,596
I have, of course,
taken that into account.

321
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:07,039
<i>He's a very sweet man.</i>

322
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:09,719
He and his rather dreary wife
are on holiday in France,

323
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:12,035
but as soon as he returns,
I'll throw a fly at him.

324
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,069
Pardon?

325
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,157
<i>That's a fisherman's term, dear.
It has to do with hooking a trout.</i>

326
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,713
You do lead a narrow life.

327
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,274
Meanwhile, do begin work
on our marvellous new idea.

328
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:21,753
Without permission?

329
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,189
Oh! We've found your milk!

330
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:29,715
<i>Mrs Henderson's request is,
of course, entirely out of order.</i>

331
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,671
<i>Of course. I'm well aware of that.</i>

332
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,039
- Oh, Tommy!
- Laura, how wonderful to see you.

333
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,152
<i>- You don't look a day older.
- What a touching little lie.</i>

334
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,078
I do know a bit about why you're here,
you know.

335
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,031
- Oh?
- Hm.

336
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:48,949
I find that lines have to be drawn
somewhere, my dear Laura,

337
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:52,589
and nudity
is on the wrong side of the divide.

338
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:55,473
I have problems enough
with the length of skirts.

339
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,798
I've had to have inches added to them
for the new Offenbach production.

340
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:02,559
<i>Well, we won't have that problem
as we won't have skirts.</i>

341
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,557
Sir? If I may?

342
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,797
We have very strict rules
in these areas, Mrs Henderson.

343
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:11,638
Oh, this office is so stuffy.

344
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,113
<i>Why don't we take a bit of a walk?</i>

345
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:16,630
- Sir?
- A walk. Yes. Lovely.

346
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,796
<i>Why didn't you return to India?</i>

347
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,559
<i>I was only ever Robert's wife in India.</i>

348
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,160
It seemed a bit absurd
without a Robert.

349
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,113
Now I find it most amusing to run
a variety show, and I'll tell you why.

350
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:31,798
Robert took me to music hall
quite often - he was fond of them -

351
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:35,594
On condition that I stayed behind the
curtain in a box and was never visible.

352
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:38,029
In those days, it was considered
terribly improper

353
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,469
for a married woman
to be seen at a music hall.

354
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,231
But times have moved on.

355
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:46,071
<i>And we must move with them,
mustn't we?</i>

356
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,631
Oh, look! A tent!

357
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,476
<i>It's unusual to see a tent in the park.</i>

358
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:52,714
Quite so.

359
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,358
I had it constructed this morning.

360
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:56,673
Did you obtain a licence?

361
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:58,517
Oh, come inside, you old fogey.

362
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:00,471
I've prepared lunch.

363
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,033
But the be-all and end-all, finally,
is that they are naked.

364
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,593
Like paintings. In a museum.

365
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,676
These sandwiches
are particularly good.

366
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,836
<i>It's an excellent season for salmon.</i>

367
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,996
<i>We haven't exactly reached
salmon season yet.</i>

368
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,156
Tommy, you're so literal.

369
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,919
<i>You're thinking bosoms,
but I'm thinking breasts.</i>

370
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:23,111
- What is the difference?
- The difference is in your soul.

371
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,071
- Cheese?
- Thank you.

372
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,957
Of course, paintings in a museum
are still, are they not?

373
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:30,675
Still?

374
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:33,792
<i>The figures do not move.
I suppose there's something in that.</i>

375
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:36,671
Mm, this cheese is very good indeed.

376
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,637
If the girls did not move...

377
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,669
Tableaux?

378
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,908
Precisely.

379
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,589
Then one might make a direct corollary
with an art gallery.

380
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,996
I can perhaps see the possibility
of some artistic merit.

381
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,711
- They never move?
- Never.

382
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,512
Yes, that would be like a museum.

383
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,518
Which was, my dear, your suggestion,
so you must be very pleased.

384
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,153
<i>I'm warming to the idea.</i>

385
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,350
- My secretary would be appalled...
- More wine?

386
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,992
Ah, yes, thank you.

387
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,712
Now, what about...

388
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,478
forgive me... the foliage?

389
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:08,839
Foliage?

390
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,438
You know... beneath the...

391
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:12,755
- Beneath what? Try the brie.
- Thank you.

392
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,472
- Beneath...
- Flown in from France.

393
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:17,910
- Excellent. The foliage beneath the...
- My husband was very fond of it.

394
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:19,757
- Of what?
- This particular cheese.

395
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,556
My dear, I am attempting to address

396
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:25,712
the disagreeable and somewhat
sordid topic of the pudendum.

397
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:27,751
- What on earth is that?
- Good heavens, woman!

398
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,956
- Have some more wine.
- The female part.

399
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,194
Oh! The pussy!

400
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,797
<i>Why didn't you say?</i>

401
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:36,798
I had not expected you, of all people,
to use such language.

402
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,274
That word was popular
in the mid-nineteenth century.

403
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,430
Not everyone speaks Latin, you know.

404
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,155
<i>Then I'd prefer you refer to it as...
the midlands.</i>

405
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,111
Oh, dear.

406
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:50,869
<i>You men do get into such a state
about the midlands, don't you?</i>

407
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,399
<i>Well, you needn't worry.</i>

408
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,275
Our lighting will be so subtle,
the disputed area will be barely visible.

409
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,399
Anyway, we'll have a barber.

410
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:06,876
You are the most exasperating woman!
You always were.

411
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:09,115
I take that to mean
you'll permit us to have a go.

412
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,390
As long as no-one moves, yes.

413
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,559
Perhaps.

414
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,070
I reserve final judgment...
until opening night.

415
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:23,637
<i>I'm delighted, dear ladies, that you all
wish to be a part of our endeavour.</i>

416
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,591
Thank you very much.

417
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,476
- Saliva.
- Behave!

418
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,957
I've never realised
how similar breasts are to shoes.

419
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,955
- What do you mean?
- They come in so many sizes.

420
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,468
I've always found them
rather overrated, myself.

421
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:45,033
Well, you're not a man.

422
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,479
Alas.

423
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:49,715
All right, ladies. Off you go.

424
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:03,191
What do you make of her?

425
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:05,390
<i>- She's beautiful.
- Yes.</i>

426
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,590
But the nipples...
Too large?

427
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,750
They're not British.
Could be Italian.

428
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:12,471
We must have British nipples.

429
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,791
And how about her?

430
00:31:19,760 --> 00:31:21,591
<i>The right one's bigger than the left.</i>

431
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,150
Her.

432
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:30,839
Fried eggs.

433
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:31,869
Sorry.

434
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:37,069
Thank you very much. Could you all
please wait in the wings? Thank you.

435
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,912
- What, basically, are you looking for?
- Personality.

436
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,076
Something in their smile, their eyes.

437
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:45,953
Well, I suggest you start looking
in their faces.

438
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,119
Yes, of course!

439
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,196
We're looking at the wrong kind of girl.

440
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,037
<i>We shouldn't have theatricals.</i>

441
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,435
- Maggie, make a note.
- My dear?

442
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,914
Bertie and I
are going to tour the countryside

443
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,518
and discover some English roses.

444
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,552
Oh, good!
Now you're getting the hang of it.

445
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,595
<i>It's been an unsuccessful trip,
my friend.</i>

446
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,592
<i>What I'm looking for is... personality.</i>

447
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:15,234
Youth. Beauty.

448
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,191
Certainly not talent.

449
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,798
Anyone can have talent.

450
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,756
And they must be well brought up.

451
00:32:21,800 --> 00:32:24,837
I think many of the young women
we've been seeing

452
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,348
come from
rather awkward backgrounds.

453
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:38,396
Shine the light on the water!

454
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,833
<i>Don't panic! The young fellow's
a dancer. Excellent coordination.</i>

455
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:54,910
<i>That's it. Pull her... That's it.</i>

456
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,629
Come on. There we go. There you are.

457
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:01,274
- You're all right.
- Let me see.

458
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,231
Oh, my God!

459
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:07,915
<i>I'm so sorry. I'm so embarrassed.</i>

460
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,678
<i>I didn't mean to cause any trouble.</i>

461
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,317
No need to be embarrassed.
You've found a knight.

462
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:16,955
Two knights, in shining armour.

463
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:22,072
My God! What a beautiful smile!

464
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:23,519
Exquisite.

465
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:29,432
Have you ever considered
going on the stage?

466
00:33:53,678 --> 00:33:55,397
You moved.

467
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,431
<i>- She mustn't move!
- I'm sorry, Mr Van Damm.</i>

468
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:02,478
The law insists
that you be absolutely still.

469
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:05,512
<i>- Why don't we take a break?
- Yes, good idea.</i>

470
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:08,791
Rest your arms, girls.
Get the circulation going.

471
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:16,559
<i>- There's er... teacups and...
- Tea.</i>

472
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,795
...tea just downstairs.

473
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:23,914
<i>Oh! Oh, it's so sweet!</i>

474
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,958
You're perched in the orchestra pit
like little birds.

475
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:28,911
It feels safe down here.

476
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,031
- Are you all right?
- Yes, thank you. My arm went numb.

477
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:36,868
I would sometimes see people in India
standing still for hours on end, my dear.

478
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,434
They were called fakirs.
It was all rather spiritual.

479
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,629
Oh, I see.

480
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:43,035
You must think yourself
onto a higher plane.

481
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,674
<i>We'd all like to be on a higher plane
now, Mrs Henderson.</i>

482
00:34:45,720 --> 00:34:48,553
Preferably flying over the Channel.

483
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,000
- Oh, you're the one that was...
- Drowning.

484
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,674
- Come on.
- I like that girl you ran over.

485
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,096
<i>Why don't you and the dog have a look
at the programme proofs in the office?</i>

486
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:03,874
<i>- You're trying to get rid of us.
- It's a delicate time.</i>

487
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,316
All the more reason for
a motherly presence.

488
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,669
Maggie!
Take Mrs Henderson to the office.

489
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:09,438
- Out!
- Well, of course.

490
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:11,633
You're in charge.

491
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,398
Right.

492
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:18,715
Time for you to disrobe.

493
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,273
Do we have to do it now,
Mr Van Damm?

494
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,754
- Well, when else?
- I was just asking.

495
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,190
<i>- Should have left you in the water.
- Come on, girls, let's do it.</i>

496
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,759
I can't!

497
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:45,249
<i>Where's she going?
- She can't face it.</i>

498
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,072
<i>What's wrong with everybody?</i>

499
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,071
<i>I'm sorry, Mr Van Damm.</i>

500
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,072
<i>There's no work outside.</i>

501
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,315
<i>I just thought, well it's a job.
All of my friends are starving.</i>

502
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:03,674
I was... lucky to have employment.
But...

503
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:06,553
<i>You can't imagine what it feels like,
just standing there.</i>

504
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,431
Not even my boyfriend
has seen me naked.

505
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,232
And we've been to bed and everything.

506
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:13,158
<i>It's like it's... medical.</i>

507
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,119
Do you think... I would ever subject you

508
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,628
to anything improper or tawdry?

509
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:25,594
I am enabling you to earn an honest
salary in this most difficult of times.

510
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,110
<i>After a hard week's work, you can take
home enough to maintain your home,</i>

511
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,516
help out your parents
and even save a little bit for the future.

512
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,994
And all you have to do

513
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:38,191
is display certain blessings
you received from the Lord.

514
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:42,917
Why do you think God gave you
all your bits and pieces?

515
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:47,036
So that you might be
ashamed of them?

516
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,991
So that you might hide them away?

517
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:54,316
<i>Isn't great art, after all,
a celebration of nature?</i>

518
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,999
<i>- That's what this is.
- Art?</i>

519
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,553
Absolutely.

520
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:01,478
You are the Venus de Milo,
the Mona Lisa...

521
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,192
The Mona Lisa wore a dress.

522
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,151
Some do, some don't.

523
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:10,048
Tomorrow, we'll go to the museum
and look at some paintings.

524
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:11,909
Botticelli.

525
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,911
Now, he was inspired.

526
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,428
Inspired by God.

527
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:19,199
<i>If I'm placing a weighty burden
on your shoulders,</i>

528
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:22,835
then I know you have
the moral strength to carry it.

529
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,233
<i>Why don't we try it again?</i>

530
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,111
All right?

531
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,391
I'll see you on the stage.

532
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,831
<i>Come on, girls,
let's give it a go.</i>

533
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:37,889
<i>I don't fancy working
in my father's chemist.</i>

534
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,118
Art. Art.

535
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:47,229
Sorry.

536
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,595
Actually, there is a draught in here,
Mr Van Damm.

537
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,154
You expect that in a theatre.
You expect draughts.

538
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,668
- But what happens if we catch cold?
- Bertie!

539
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,996
Get someone to close the doors
and check all the windows, will you?

540
00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:00,594
Thank you. All right?
- Yes, thank you.

541
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,073
Does everyone have to watch us?

542
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,634
- Who?
- Well, them.

543
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,228
You're going to have
an entire audience watching you.

544
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,872
Yes, but they'll be strangers.

545
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,356
<i>And they won't be standing so close...
will they?</i>

546
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,834
- We can hear them breathing.
- A man has to breathe.

547
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,108
Heavy breathing.

548
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:22,272
<i>After all, it doesn't seem fair for them
to be dressed when we're not.</i>

549
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,629
Okey-doke. I know what to do.

550
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,954
Come on, gentlemen. Come on.
You too.

551
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,752
- What?
- Fair is fair.

552
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,956
<i>Let's make the ladies comfortable.</i>

553
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:37,437
Come on.

554
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,674
Strip.

555
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,711
You too, Mr Van Damm.

556
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:47,877
<i>Don't be ridiculous. Someone has to
maintain authority here.</i>

557
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:49,956
- Take your clothes off, please.
- No.

558
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,150
Off! Off! Off!

559
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:56,239
Off! Off! Off! Off! Off! Off!

560
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,192
Off! Off! Off! Off!

561
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,629
All right! All right!

562
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,152
Bloody childish!

563
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,556
Mrs Henderson. Mrs Henderson!

564
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:22,833
Why, Mr Van Damm...

565
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:25,638
<i>...you are Jewish!</i>

566
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,076
- I think I saw a priest in the audience.
- Oh, stop it! You're hallucinating!

567
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:40,554
- Everyone looked so rich.
- Oh, I hope so.

568
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,079
When I take off my clothes,

569
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,634
<i>I close my eyes and think,
"This will bring me champagne. "</i>

570
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:47,148
<i>I think, "One more day
and it hasn't happened yet. "</i>

571
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,193
Oh, my God!

572
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,878
I've brought
the Lord Chamberlain.

573
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,388
He felt he had to say a few words
of encouragement to you.

574
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:56,078
<i>Isn't that delicious?</i>

575
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:59,031
Well done.

576
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,991
Well done. I...

577
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:06,429
May I be... permitted to say...

578
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:10,557
...that... Oh, good heavens!

579
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,591
Good heavens! I...

580
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,232
I...

581
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,750
What an artistic enterprise er...

582
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,792
you have um...

583
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:23,877
A testament, really, to the British p...

584
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,839
<i>- It's a magical evening.
- Hm?</i>

585
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,029
I quite understand
what you were feeling.

586
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:34,672
I myself have exhibited my breasts.

587
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,836
I was at a party in Antibes

588
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,030
with The Duchess of Denby
and Countess Volpe,

589
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:43,198
and we took off our blouses -
in private, of course -

590
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,800
<i>and looked at each other's titties.</i>

591
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,951
My, how we laughed!

592
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,793
The Lord Chamberlain
was very taken with you, my dear.

593
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,754
- Mrs Henderson.
- Mr Van Damm. Quite an evening.

594
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,631
The Lord Chamberlain
was very pleased.

595
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,591
I wanted you to meet Natalie.

596
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,993
- Natalie?
- My wife.

597
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,191
<i>Vivian's spoken about you sooften,
I just feel that I know you.</i>

598
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,350
<i>Well... I certainly don't know you!</i>

599
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,311
Excuse me.

600
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:34,396
You can be rude to me,
but not to my wife!

601
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:36,874
What wife?
When did you acquire a wife?

602
00:42:36,920 --> 00:42:39,878
<i>- Why haven't you told us?
- What do you mean?</i>

603
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,399
You never mentioned her.

604
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,278
I believe a figure of authority
must maintain a sense of privacy.

605
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,191
Good heavens! A wife!

606
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:47,599
What exactly is the problem?

607
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:49,358
Whoon earth said
there was a problem?

608
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,516
Fine. Have a wife, if you insist.

609
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:54,199
<i>Just don't let her interfere
with any of your duties.</i>

610
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,310
<i>- Why would she do that?
- That's what wives do.</i>

611
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,635
<i>That's their purpose. I know.
I was a wife.</i>

612
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:00,113
I interfered all the time.

613
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,275
So sack me, then!

614
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:04,517
If you're unhappy with me,
just say it and I'll leave!

615
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:08,792
<i>But don't you dare ever, ever
talk to my wife like that again!</i>

616
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,035
<i>Oh, don't you worry.
I'll keep my eye on you.</i>

617
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,433
You do that.

618
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:18,312
I hope you realise I will never, ever,
ever set foot in this theatre again!

619
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,789
You two behave
like an old married couple.

620
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:27,388
Well, it seems
that would make him a bigamist.

621
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,311
Champagne, then?

622
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,711
It is rather as I thought.

623
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,671
Your heart has stirred.

624
00:43:37,720 --> 00:43:39,631
Then I must consult a physician.

625
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,914
This should have been
such a pleasant night.

626
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:34,470
- I want you to flank her.
- Flank her?

627
00:44:34,560 --> 00:44:37,279
- Stand either side of her.
- Oh.

628
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:39,470
<i>Aren't I in silhouette, like in the picture?</i>

629
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,516
- Silhouette.
- Silhouette, Harry!

630
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:44,757
- And the sun must rise behind you.
- Orange.

631
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:48,475
We see the rays of the sun,
like in the picture.

632
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,878
A new dawn over the New World.

633
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,508
Goody, goody.

634
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:10,871
Goody, goody.

635
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:13,953
Goody, goody.

636
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,075
And now...

637
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:18,429
- How...
... do you do?

638
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:19,233
Do something!

639
00:46:23,480 --> 00:46:25,835
How will I explain this
to the Lord Chamberlain?

640
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:20,235
Coming through!
Excuse me, Mr Van Damm. Sorry.

641
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,511
I forgot my fin.

642
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,516
It'll have to be tighter than that.

643
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:27,357
- Good afternoon, Doris.
- Afternoon.

644
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,516
<i>- How's your mother?
- She's fine, thank you.</i>

645
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:31,437
Have you been writing
to her every week?

646
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:34,631
<i>Yes. She told me to tell you
she's very disappointed I'm a starfish.</i>

647
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:37,831
- She thinks I should be a mermaid.
- Ah. I'll send her a note.

648
00:47:39,480 --> 00:47:41,550
- And who have we here?
- Catherine the Great.

649
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,556
Have you forgotten
the tableau of the wars?

650
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,431
Come along, Mr Van Damm.
Wakey-wakey.

651
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,391
You might show a bit more respect.

652
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:50,716
- I think I should have...
... left you in the water.

653
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,513
- Afternoon, girls. How are you?
- Better now, Mr Van Damm.

654
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,790
- Was something wrong?
- My bum cheeks went numb.

655
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:59,116
She was leaning arse over backwards.
In the Alaskan tableau, of course.

656
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,354
All that ice.

657
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,436
But Rupert soon got
the blood flowing!

658
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,152
<i>- Who's Rupert?
- Well you might ask.</i>

659
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,269
Behave yourself!

660
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,272
We must be cautious
about too much frivolity.

661
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,231
The Windmill
is a very serious business!

662
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,231
Yes, Mr Van Damm.

663
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,078
- Do I give it to the students again, sir?
- Mr Van Damm.

664
00:48:25,080 --> 00:48:26,991
At your own discretion, dear boy.

665
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:30,277
<i>It's beastly.</i>

666
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:33,157
<i>I can't walk into my own theatre.</i>

667
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,035
I hear wonderful things
about the new performances

668
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:37,433
<i>and I'm missing all the fun.</i>

669
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:40,472
You did say you would never set foot
in the The Windmill again.

670
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:42,590
<i>Quite right.
The man's a monster.</i>

671
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:44,358
I want nothing to do with him.

672
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:46,356
You're very much like
my granddaughter

673
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,278
who moans about the boy
she has her eye on.

674
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:54,110
Adolescents and women in their
eighth decade are strikingly similar.

675
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,513
You obviously require a battle plan.

676
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,752
My second husband, the General,

677
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,439
always advocated
attacking from the rear,

678
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:09,109
which, although it did nothing
to enhance our marriage,

679
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:11,390
did bring him some success
on the field.

680
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,516
Just slip in there, as it were,

681
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:17,551
and establish your beachhead.

682
00:49:22,760 --> 00:49:24,796
Excuse us!
This is a private dressing room.

683
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,717
<i>It's only me.</i>

684
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:30,196
<i>I'm sorry, but I did not want to be seen
in the theatre.</i>

685
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:33,515
Oh, I have missed your company.

686
00:49:33,560 --> 00:49:36,950
<i>I thought I'd just drop by
to see if you needed anything.</i>

687
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,672
Actually, if this may be our secret -

688
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:41,598
<i>Mr um... Whatshisname
doesn't know I'm here.</i>

689
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,358
We're fine, thank you, Mrs Henderson.

690
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:45,630
<i>My poor dear, I'm having some cheese
sent up to you.</i>

691
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,075
<i>- Cheese?
- I'm not convinced you eat enough.</i>

692
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:50,429
<i>Yes, it's terribly sad.
She's just skin and bones.</i>

693
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,796
Shut up! I weigh exactly what I weighed
the day I started this job, no less.

694
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,479
<i>Something's wrong.
She won't eat chocolate truffles.</i>

695
00:49:56,520 --> 00:49:59,637
<i>- She's so very, very head-girl.
- So sensible!</i>

696
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:02,319
<i>You see, it's unanimous.
You're positively scrawny!</i>

697
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,271
You may laugh, but I know men.

698
00:50:04,360 --> 00:50:06,828
Men look at bosoms, my dear,
but I notice bones.

699
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:08,359
What?

700
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:10,356
Spots!

701
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:11,879
No-one will notice.

702
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,672
Now, you must promise to let me know

703
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,557
if you have any complaints
or problems.

704
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:19,070
I mean, does Mr Van Damm treat...
Oh, my dear!

705
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:21,554
I wore a similar wig to a ball in Delhi.

706
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,313
<i>Didn't look nearly as becoming
as it does on you.</i>

707
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:25,679
Thank you, Mrs Henderson.

708
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,517
You remind me a bit of myself
at that time.

709
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,755
<i>- Not too thin?
- Oh, you'd be surprised.</i>

710
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:31,916
Now, remember not to tell anyone
I've been here.

711
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:33,831
<i>Of course not. It's just between us girls.</i>

712
00:50:33,920 --> 00:50:36,718
<i>- You all get on rather well, don't you?
- Yes, we're like a family.</i>

713
00:50:36,800 --> 00:50:38,756
<i>There hasn't been
any improper behaviour?</i>

714
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:42,475
<i>- From Mr Van Damm, that is.
- He's very good to us, Mrs Henderson.</i>

715
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:45,074
<i>He's like a father.
If fathers were nice.</i>

716
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:47,156
- He treats us as what we are.
- And what is that?

717
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,713
Artists.

718
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:51,228
I have seemingly handed him
a kingdom.

719
00:50:51,280 --> 00:50:53,032
Complete with harem.

720
00:50:53,120 --> 00:50:55,714
Then, my dear,
you must infiltrate.

721
00:50:55,800 --> 00:50:59,076
Like a delicious,
if overripe, Mata Hari.

722
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:04,277
Might I propose subterfuge?

723
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:07,151
Good afternoon.

724
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,274
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

725
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,271
Good afternoon.

726
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:16,512
Amazing. We get all kinds.

727
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,835
I have a very odd feeling, VD.

728
00:51:21,560 --> 00:51:24,836
What I really need
is a rubber trumpet. Yes.

729
00:51:24,880 --> 00:51:26,916
I've had an offer to join a rubber band!

730
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:28,916
<i>Please don't do this!</i>

731
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,871
Mrs Henderson, you are a fraud!

732
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,831
Oh. Oh!

733
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,948
<i>Don't you dare manhandle me!</i>

734
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:39,514
- Make a fool of yourself, if you must...
- Mr Van Damm!

735
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,074
...but not of me!
- No! Argh!

736
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,111
What on earth do you think
you were doing?

737
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,760
I simply want to make sure
you are doing your job properly.

738
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:49,633
It was most unpleasant of you
to grab my hairpiece.

739
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:53,120
<i>That's made of authentic
Chinese hair!</i>

740
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,116
Well, now you'll have some time

741
00:51:55,160 --> 00:51:58,038
to calm down
and examine your behaviour.

742
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:02,038
My husband put me
on top of a cupboard once.

743
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,311
You have so much in common.

744
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:08,031
<i>I'd like you to behave.</i>

745
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:11,436
No doubt your husband said that to you
as well.

746
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:12,799
Oh, Mr Van Damm...

747
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:15,239
<i>...I just can't help myself.</i>

748
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:18,236
Well... cheerio, then.

749
00:52:18,280 --> 00:52:21,477
<i>No! Don't you dare leave me here!
No, don't you dare!</i>

750
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,909
<i>Don't you dare leave me!</i>

751
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:36,512
<i>This act's not half bad.</i>

752
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:47,988
Thank you... very much.

753
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,034
<i>You can't have an animal on stage
with naked women.</i>

754
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,553
Yes, I see that.

755
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:55,999
<i>It's a shame.</i>

756
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:58,600
<i>- I've got the new song.
Let's hear it.</i>

757
00:53:04,360 --> 00:53:06,191
Slower.

758
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,631
- What?
# The girl in the little green hat

759
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,591
You better see for yourself.

760
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,311
Hi, Mrs Henderson!

761
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:09,912
<i>Try the river. It's Tuesday.</i>

762
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:11,871
- Get me a taxi.
- Yes, VD.

763
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:17,275
- Tea?
- Yes, please. To take away.

764
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:19,390
We need a lot of caffeine.
We're exhausted.

765
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:21,476
You're exhausted?

766
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,034
All you girls do is just stand there.

767
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:27,518
And that, I am told,
is the definition of a star.

768
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,718
This has got to stop!

769
00:54:38,760 --> 00:54:41,228
We're running a serious theatre.

770
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,430
The entire West End is laughing at us.

771
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:46,956
<i>I haven't worked for years
to achieve a position of respect</i>

772
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,911
Only to be perceived as a joke!

773
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,229
If all you want to be is a dilettante,
take your money and go someplace else!

774
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,436
I can't... hear you!

775
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:02,791
<i>I'm not simply frivolous, you know.</i>

776
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,638
<i>And I don't ever, ever
want to be taken for granted.</i>

777
00:55:06,600 --> 00:55:09,512
Actually, I wished to ascertain
that artists who audition for us

778
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:11,630
are being treated
with the proper respect.

779
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:14,274
It turns out they are.
I am perfectly satisfied.

780
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:21,393
On another matter entirely,
I was thinking about billing.

781
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:24,034
<i>The programme says
"Mrs Henderson Presents Revudeville. "</i>

782
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:26,389
<i>It's absolutely charming,
but perhaps unfair.</i>

783
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,989
<i>Shouldn't it be
"Mrs Henderson Presents Revudeville -</i>

784
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:32,190
<i>a Vivian Van Damm production"?</i>

785
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,319
<i>I rather like that, don't you?</i>

786
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,758
<i>I'm going to have a joyride now.
Isn't that exciting?</i>

787
00:55:50,840 --> 00:55:52,990
I am not a servant!

788
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,191
<i>You can't buy me off
with a piece of billing!</i>

789
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,316
Do you hear? Bloody woman!

790
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:16,511
Is it well stocked with petrol?

791
00:56:17,320 --> 00:56:19,197
What do you mean?

792
00:56:19,240 --> 00:56:21,356
Do you think
we might make it to France?

793
00:57:07,160 --> 00:57:09,151
<i>I don't think I'll be back for a while.</i>

794
00:57:33,352 --> 00:57:35,852
Hitler invades France

795
00:58:14,840 --> 00:58:16,751
- Mr Van Damm.
Mrs Henderson.

796
00:58:16,840 --> 00:58:18,796
Welcome back.
- Thank you.

797
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:59,796
Do you mind if I sit here for a while?

798
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,751
Suit yourself.

799
01:00:18,560 --> 01:00:20,471
<i>I'm so sorry, Mr Van Damm.</i>

800
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,671
I imagine...

801
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,191
...you have family.

802
01:00:33,320 --> 01:00:34,719
Yes.

803
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,671
<i>I can't bear feeling helpless.</i>

804
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,715
<i>I always think
there's something I can do.</i>

805
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:46,037
<i>But sometimes, of course...
there's nothing.</i>

806
01:01:05,880 --> 01:01:07,791
Champagne, madam?

807
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,994
Attention!

808
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,951
<i>Don't you feel a bit over-safe?</i>

809
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,911
Caution, my dear, caution.

810
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:32,636
You know, we're not certain what to do
about the theatres.

811
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,877
- Whatever do you mean?
- They're a frivolous distraction.

812
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:38,992
<i>Exactly what young soldiers need.
Wouldn't you say?</i>

813
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:46,679
There are other considerations.

814
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,439
Our intelligence tells us
the Luftwaffe will bomb London.

815
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,357
<i>My dear, my intelligence tells me that.</i>

816
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:54,233
<i>Then it will be dangerous
for people to congregate, won't it?</i>

817
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:56,794
<i>Oh, Tommy! Don't be silly!</i>

818
01:01:57,640 --> 01:01:59,073
Congregate underground?

819
01:01:59,160 --> 01:02:01,355
Remember,
my theatre is beneath street level.

820
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,231
<i>It's the safest place to be.</i>

821
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:05,874
<i>Now, let's have no more
of these foolish ideas.</i>

822
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,791
Oh, Tommy!

823
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,871
<i>Flres were started agaln last nlght
In the East End.</i>

824
01:04:19,920 --> 01:04:23,913
<i>Londoners awoke after the tenth
consecutlve nlght of bombardment</i>

825
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:25,871
<i>by the German alr force.</i>

826
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:30,349
We have a huge challenge before us.

827
01:04:31,240 --> 01:04:33,993
<i>It's up to us, Revudeville,</i>

828
01:04:34,040 --> 01:04:38,989
to fortify London in a way that
sandbags and anti-aircraft cannot do.

829
01:04:39,960 --> 01:04:42,269
They may bomb our city,

830
01:04:42,320 --> 01:04:44,276
destroy our homes,

831
01:04:44,360 --> 01:04:45,873
kill our friends and neighbours,

832
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,469
but through it all,
our show will continue.

833
01:04:50,840 --> 01:04:54,894
We will never stop performing,
and we will never close!

834
01:04:55,680 --> 01:04:59,074
<i>He thinks
he's bloody Winston Churchill.</i>

835
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:01,628
Some of our family are going.

836
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,432
Called up.

837
01:05:03,480 --> 01:05:04,833
Yes.

838
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:07,471
Thank God our Bertie
has a heart murmur.

839
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:13,194
It may be wise for some of you
to move into the theatre.

840
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:17,472
We have room,
and because we're underground, we're safe.

841
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,911
Of course, we'll all have our war duties
as well as theatrical ones.

842
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,439
But...

843
01:05:23,480 --> 01:05:27,792
<i>we wlll pitch in and we wlll doour bit.</i>

844
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:30,673
That was beautifully put,
Mr Van Damm.

845
01:05:30,720 --> 01:05:33,314
<i>I'm sure we will all make
the necessary sacrifices.</i>

846
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:37,589
Yesterday I wanted to buy a new hat.
I desisted.

847
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:40,154
I put the money
in National Savings instead.

848
01:05:41,980 --> 01:05:43,599
We shall come through.

849
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,557
<i>Ken said you were up here.
I didn't believe him.</i>

850
01:08:30,600 --> 01:08:31,874
Why ever not?

851
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:35,071
<i>It's bloody dangerous, that's why!
Come on down.</i>

852
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:36,798
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

853
01:08:37,560 --> 01:08:39,357
The aircraft have passed.

854
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:41,550
Look, you can see them
over the East End.

855
01:08:42,680 --> 01:08:45,194
You're ever so cautious,
Mr Van Damm.

856
01:08:46,360 --> 01:08:49,830
<i>One shouldn't be overly so
at times like these.</i>

857
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,472
Everyone should be cautious.

858
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:03,595
<i>You don't seem to take war
too seriously, Mrs Henderson.</i>

859
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,997
I wonder what you were like
when you were young.

860
01:09:10,040 --> 01:09:11,951
Rather dashing, I dare say.

861
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,631
And filled with hope.

862
01:09:16,280 --> 01:09:19,340
My mind turns towards young men
these days.

863
01:09:21,400 --> 01:09:22,799
You see, Mr Van Damm,

864
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:26,874
I take war far more seriously
than you can ever dare imagine.

865
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:39,278
No, you'll have to cover her
faster than that.

866
01:10:39,320 --> 01:10:43,108
- You need to be a lot faster.
- Those things weigh a ton, Bertie.

867
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,071
Goon. Take five minutes.

868
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:50,519
No, no, no... get it up.

869
01:10:50,560 --> 01:10:52,073
<i>I just can't lift it higher.</i>

870
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,351
Oh, my dear, how generous.

871
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:02,155
- My goodness!
- Gin.

872
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,316
Help steel our nerves for the air raids.

873
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,909
It does seem they're no longer bombing
during the tableaux.

874
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:10,952
<i>Well, that's because Mr Van Damm
sent Hitler our programme.</i>

875
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:13,550
Professional courtesy between Führers.

876
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,715
You're all so energetic and courageous.

877
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:21,639
We're the only theatre
still playing in the West End.

878
01:11:21,680 --> 01:11:24,558
<i>Then you all goout with the soldiers
after the show. It's admirable.</i>

879
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,353
Oh, but I don't. Well, I never goout.

880
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:29,311
My dear, why ever not?

881
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,999
Before I started stripping off
for a living, I was always falling in love.

882
01:11:35,440 --> 01:11:37,351
I was hopeless.

883
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:40,111
Never again.

884
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:42,991
So I've become a right little priss.

885
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,439
A naked spinster.

886
01:11:46,480 --> 01:11:48,391
<i>And that's the way I like it.</i>

887
01:11:49,480 --> 01:11:52,392
Who would have dreamed
that standing on a stage

888
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:56,032
without any clothes on
would be the safest place to be?

889
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:43,238
Could you er... come this way, sir?

890
01:12:44,600 --> 01:12:46,830
Mrs Henderson
would like to speak to you.

891
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:56,955
<i>Who's the flower for?</i>

892
01:12:57,000 --> 01:12:58,591
The girl inside the fan.

893
01:12:58,640 --> 01:13:01,114
Speak up, dear.
- The girl in the fan.

894
01:13:01,240 --> 01:13:03,151
Oh. Yes.

895
01:13:04,760 --> 01:13:07,035
- How old are you?
- 21.

896
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:10,195
21?

897
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:13,349
Too young for her, I suppose.

898
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,311
Come back tomorrow night.

899
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:20,594
Sweet.

900
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,552
<i>I was always afraid that someday
I'd end up working in a florist shop.</i>

901
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,830
<i>- And now you are.
- I'm getting hay fever.</i>

902
01:13:31,880 --> 01:13:33,233
And who is Paul?

903
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:34,594
I have no idea.

904
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:36,636
Are you girls decent?

905
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:37,829
Oh, good.

906
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,791
I've brought someone.

907
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:42,149
This is Paul.

908
01:13:42,200 --> 01:13:44,350
Oh. I see. Erm...

909
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:45,879
Girls, can you er...

910
01:13:58,720 --> 01:14:01,234
- I was... looking forward to...
- Speak up, dear.

911
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,316
Would you mind
if I had a moment alone?

912
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:05,271
Thank you.

913
01:14:07,800 --> 01:14:10,394
<i>- You've sent all these flowers.
- Don't be foolish, my dear.</i>

914
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:13,557
<i>I recognised the name of your florist.
He can't afford this sort of thing.</i>

915
01:14:13,640 --> 01:14:15,551
He comes from
a very distinguished family.

916
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,511
- Mrs Henderson!
- Well...

917
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,676
Truth is so prosaic.

918
01:14:19,720 --> 01:14:21,790
<i>He's young. That's all.</i>

919
01:14:21,840 --> 01:14:24,070
<i>And rather well put together,
wouldn't you say?</i>

920
01:14:24,120 --> 01:14:25,553
That face.

921
01:14:28,360 --> 01:14:30,078
<i>He's young.</i>

922
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:32,851
And in five days he goes to the front.

923
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,591
And he may not come back.

924
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,915
<i>- And it's so lonely out there in the...
- Trenches.</i>

925
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:40,030
Yes, I know the word.

926
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,355
Books have been written
about the last war,

927
01:14:42,440 --> 01:14:44,431
and I have actually read some of them.

928
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:48,735
And I suppose he saw me on stage
and fell in love.

929
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:54,835
Mrs Henderson,
one night my bicycle went off the road

930
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,832
and the next thing I knew,
I was an illusion.

931
01:14:57,880 --> 01:15:00,269
<i>Because that's all we are up there.</i>

932
01:15:00,320 --> 01:15:03,471
<i>But the odd thing is I'm still in
that river, and I want to be rescued.</i>

933
01:15:03,560 --> 01:15:07,439
<i>But not by some drum roll
or applause or a soldier's fantasy.</i>

934
01:15:08,200 --> 01:15:10,156
Oh, dear,

935
01:15:10,200 --> 01:15:12,873
you're such a tiresome generation.

936
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,115
You all want love.

937
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:18,436
We got along very nicely without it,
thank you very much.

938
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,029
<i>I don't see why that boy's fantasy
is any more foolish than yours.</i>

939
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:30,951
Oh, damn.

940
01:15:32,080 --> 01:15:33,991
She loved your flowers, dear.

941
01:15:34,680 --> 01:15:36,591
What flowers?

942
01:18:14,120 --> 01:18:16,031
Trouble, boss.

943
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,909
- Is it that bloody woman again?
- No, not this time, VD.

944
01:18:23,960 --> 01:18:25,552
Open up!

945
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,716
Do you want me to
knock the door down?

946
01:18:28,720 --> 01:18:30,153
You'll hurt your shoulder.

947
01:18:30,200 --> 01:18:32,111
Get inside.

948
01:18:34,200 --> 01:18:35,428
<i>You can't do this.</i>

949
01:18:35,480 --> 01:18:37,118
- Why not?
- You're part of our family.

950
01:18:37,160 --> 01:18:38,559
A terrible choice of words.

951
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:41,273
<i>- What are you talking about?
- I don't want to discuss it.</i>

952
01:18:41,320 --> 01:18:43,959
<i>But you have to tell me what's
behind this. You owe it to me.</i>

953
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:46,150
My concern for
the aesthetics of Revudeville.

954
01:18:46,200 --> 01:18:47,758
What?

955
01:18:47,800 --> 01:18:51,309
<i>I don't think you want a nude on stage
who is pregnant!</i>

956
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,198
<i>- Oh, Christ!
- 'Scuse me, Mr Van Damm.</i>

957
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:55,310
We were having
a private discussion.

958
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,271
- We have a quick change.
- Yes.

959
01:19:04,360 --> 01:19:06,920
That was a particularly fine
programme, Mr Van Damm.

960
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:09,833
- I am pleased I recognised your talent.
- Go back into the theatre.

961
01:19:09,880 --> 01:19:12,371
I do have a few notes
about the comedy routine.

962
01:19:12,420 --> 01:19:14,150
<i>We don't have time for nonsense.
We have a crisis.</i>

963
01:19:14,200 --> 01:19:16,270
<i>Why? Whatever's wrong?</i>

964
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:19,073
Maureen has just sent me
a letter of resignation.

965
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,758
<i>Don't be ridiculous.
Why would she?</i>

966
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:21,949
<i>Because she's pregnant.</i>

967
01:19:22,000 --> 01:19:24,070
Two minutes, girls!

968
01:19:24,120 --> 01:19:26,299
- Oh, my dear...
- I need some air.

969
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:28,950
Look... You can work in the show
as a singer for the next few months.

970
01:19:29,000 --> 01:19:30,956
We'll keep you on salary,
until you...

971
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,018
<i>I can't think clearly. I need some air.</i>

972
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:34,888
<i>I'm so sorry. Was it?</i>

973
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:36,951
Well, who else would it be?

974
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:39,069
He sent me a letter.

975
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,288
<i>After he's demobbed,
he's going back to his girlfriend.</i>

976
01:19:42,340 --> 01:19:44,174
His girlfriend!
They all have girlfriends.

977
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,595
The crazy thing is, I fell for him.

978
01:19:47,640 --> 01:19:51,030
<i>Oh, it's not your fault. I'm a grown girl.
I knew what I was doing.</i>

979
01:19:51,080 --> 01:19:52,559
But he had such a sweet face...

980
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:54,352
They all have sweet faces.

981
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,680
You live in your own world,
Mrs Henderson.

982
01:19:58,640 --> 01:20:00,153
<i>I'm sorry. Excuse me.</i>

983
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:02,350
<i>I don't want to say something
I shouldn't.</i>

984
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,433
I need some tea. And some air.

985
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:06,432
<i>She said, "It's not your fault. "</i>

986
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:07,794
That can only mean one thing.

987
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:09,319
<i>- Which is?
- That it Is your fault!</i>

988
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:10,958
- What have you been up to?
- Nothing.

989
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:13,673
<i>- Have you been giving advice?
- I don't like these questions.</i>

990
01:20:13,720 --> 01:20:16,409
Excuse me, Mr Van Damm.
I want to take some air as well.

991
01:20:16,560 --> 01:20:18,674
<i>You can't goout, Mrs Henderson.
The sirens went.</i>

992
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,789
<i>We didn't hear anything.</i>

993
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:22,070
<i>- A few minutes ago.
- Maureen's gone out.</i>

994
01:20:22,120 --> 01:20:23,394
- When?
- Just now.

995
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,510
<i>Why didn't you stop her?</i>

996
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:26,709
<i>Where's she going?</i>

997
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,798
- For some air.
- No, to tea, she said.

998
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:37,052
You foolish, foolish woman.
Look what you've done.

999
01:21:37,640 --> 01:21:39,358
I thought, "Yes, well,

1000
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:41,556
<i>she's selfish and rude and eccentric,</i>

1001
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,230
<i>but that goes with her class.
I can live with that. "</i>

1002
01:21:44,280 --> 01:21:45,633
I was a fool.

1003
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:49,638
<i>You don't know anything
about the real world, do you?</i>

1004
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:11,354
<i>It's not the same.</i>

1005
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:13,351
The boys love it, boss.

1006
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:17,953
<i>I'm from the Lord Chamberlain's office.
This is for you.</i>

1007
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,434
We have to close your theatre.

1008
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,733
What?

1009
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:25,993
<i>It's causing too many people
to congregate in front of it.</i>

1010
01:23:28,480 --> 01:23:31,438
Telephone the newspapers.
Get them down here.

1011
01:23:31,480 --> 01:23:33,072
Yes, boss.

1012
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:35,031
Maggie...

1013
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,592
I know where to find her.

1014
01:23:37,640 --> 01:23:40,074
Tell her to come to the theatre
immediately.

1015
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:48,614
Mrs Henderson would like to see
Lord Cromer as soon as possible.

1016
01:23:48,660 --> 01:23:50,271
Here, at the theatre.

1017
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,788
<i>I don't think
the Lord Chamberlain is available...</i>

1018
01:23:52,880 --> 01:23:55,735
Nonsense.
Mrs Henderson wishes to see him.

1019
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:58,311
Pray, pass the message.

1020
01:24:01,560 --> 01:24:04,633
<i>There's nothing I can do.
The theatre is closed.</i>

1021
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,192
Manners, manners.
Clear a path, please.

1022
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,759
Please, clear a path.

1023
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,791
We need to see the girls.

1024
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:13,354
<i>We ain't moving
until you open up the theatre.</i>

1025
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:15,152
<i>- Open up!
- There's nothing I can do.</i>

1026
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,475
I see the press are here, Van Damm.

1027
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:20,329
<i>Yes.
I don't know how they got hold of it, sir.</i>

1028
01:24:26,680 --> 01:24:29,069
- Good afternoon, Mrs Henderson.
- Maggie.

1029
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,478
This way.

1030
01:24:36,120 --> 01:24:39,590
There seems to be a nationwide desire
to keep this theatre open.

1031
01:24:39,640 --> 01:24:41,437
Nationwide?

1032
01:24:41,480 --> 01:24:43,436
<i>Please don't be delusional.</i>

1033
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:46,517
I have learnt in these many years
of dealing with artists

1034
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:48,471
to detest imagination.

1035
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:52,593
Excuse me.

1036
01:24:52,640 --> 01:24:54,039
Sorry.

1037
01:24:54,120 --> 01:24:56,750
This street must be clear.

1038
01:24:56,800 --> 01:24:59,872
It presents a very clear public danger.

1039
01:24:59,920 --> 01:25:02,450
I may have to ask the police
to interfere.

1040
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,270
I'll talk to them.

1041
01:25:05,080 --> 01:25:06,638
What a commotion.

1042
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:10,434
They think the theatre encourages
what they call overcongregating.

1043
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:12,072
It seems that we're too popular.

1044
01:25:12,120 --> 01:25:15,271
<i>What, you mean we'd stay open
if we were a failure? How ridiculous!</i>

1045
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,788
Listen, everybody.

1046
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,319
We have no choice.

1047
01:25:19,360 --> 01:25:21,316
The government is forcing us to close.

1048
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:25,510
One more light...
dimming in the heart of London.

1049
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,198
<i>He's turning into Winston again.</i>

1050
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:28,912
What Herr Hitler

1051
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,678
was unable to do,

1052
01:25:30,720 --> 01:25:33,759
Our own leaders
are determined to accomplish.

1053
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:36,992
They are going to close the Windmill!

1054
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:38,151
Oh, really.

1055
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:40,714
Excuse me, excuse me,
would you please let me through?

1056
01:25:40,760 --> 01:25:42,318
Excuse me.

1057
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:44,635
<i>Excuse me.
Oh, that's so kind of you. Thank you.</i>

1058
01:25:44,680 --> 01:25:46,955
<i>Thank you.
Oh, that's most kind, thank you.</i>

1059
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:47,955
Thank you.

1060
01:25:48,000 --> 01:25:49,797
Excuse me. Mr Van Damm.

1061
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:52,429
Hello, everybody.

1062
01:25:52,480 --> 01:25:54,311
Um, may I intro... Oh, hello, Tom.

1063
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:56,112
May I introduce myself?

1064
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:57,673
<i>I'm Mrs Henderson.</i>

1065
01:25:57,720 --> 01:26:01,076
You might see my name
on the billboard there.

1066
01:26:01,080 --> 01:26:02,991
Well, I am that Mrs Henderson,

1067
01:26:03,040 --> 01:26:06,396
and I have presented the Windmill
for four years now.

1068
01:26:06,440 --> 01:26:08,715
Now, let me tell you why.

1069
01:26:08,760 --> 01:26:10,671
Oh, dear, are you able to see me?

1070
01:26:10,760 --> 01:26:12,398
No...

1071
01:26:13,240 --> 01:26:14,468
Here you are, ma'am.

1072
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:15,635
<i>Oh, that's so sweet.</i>

1073
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,514
- Are you American?
- Yes.

1074
01:26:17,920 --> 01:26:19,433
Strange people, lovely manners.

1075
01:26:19,480 --> 01:26:20,708
...there was a war before this one.

1076
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:24,956
It was meant to end all wars.

1077
01:26:25,760 --> 01:26:27,971
I lost my son in that war.

1078
01:26:29,040 --> 01:26:32,378
My only son. Alec.

1079
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,031
He was 21.

1080
01:26:35,920 --> 01:26:39,435
He perished from poison gas,
I believe,

1081
01:26:39,480 --> 01:26:41,391
On a field in France.

1082
01:26:44,960 --> 01:26:50,193
After - some time after - I went to
his room to clear away his things

1083
01:26:50,280 --> 01:26:52,475
and I discovered
the most amazing thing.

1084
01:26:53,400 --> 01:26:55,989
What I believe you call
a French postcard.

1085
01:26:57,320 --> 01:26:58,958
A photograph of a naked woman.

1086
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:00,911
<i>He'd been hiding it.</i>

1087
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:05,190
And I realised that Alec
had probably gone to his death

1088
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:10,270
without ever seeing...
a woman naked in real life.

1089
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:15,639
Well, I thought
that was the most... awful thing.

1090
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,156
When you lose a son in a war,

1091
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:23,949
you do know,
no matter what anyone might say,

1092
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,911
that his death has been in vain.

1093
01:27:28,160 --> 01:27:31,736
<i>It won't stop others from following.
Other wars, other young men.</i>

1094
01:27:32,440 --> 01:27:35,156
Years later,
after my husband had died,

1095
01:27:35,240 --> 01:27:37,029
and I was on my own,
I decided to buy a theatre...

1096
01:27:37,080 --> 01:27:38,354
and put on a nude revue,

1097
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,118
so that boys like Alec...

1098
01:27:40,960 --> 01:27:43,355
...would never be
in the same predicament.

1099
01:27:44,840 --> 01:27:47,195
As long as the Windmill exists,

1100
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:52,591
<i>there's no need for a sad little postcard
stashed underneath a bed, is there?</i>

1101
01:27:55,160 --> 01:27:59,612
Sometimes... my feelings
towards our young men in uniform...

1102
01:28:01,040 --> 01:28:04,191
...have led me to foolish actions,

1103
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:07,297
which I do, in my very soul, regret.

1104
01:28:08,480 --> 01:28:10,391
But I do know this:

1105
01:28:11,160 --> 01:28:16,215
That my desire to present this gift to
our young men has not been wrong.

1106
01:28:18,200 --> 01:28:22,318
If we are to ask our youth
to surrender their lives,

1107
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:26,399
then we should not ask them
to surrender joy,

1108
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:28,359
Or the possibility of joy.

1109
01:28:29,680 --> 01:28:31,716
And if, along the way,

1110
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:35,013
we cause too many people
to congregate in the street,

1111
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:38,191
<i>who gives a fiddler's fuck?</i>

1112
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:44,892
There. I've said it.

1113
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:48,996
Oh, dear, another air raid.

1114
01:28:49,880 --> 01:28:53,031
<i>Don't you think everyone
would be so much safer inside?</i>

1115
01:28:53,080 --> 01:28:54,308
Yes!

1116
01:28:54,360 --> 01:28:56,237
<i>Oh, for Christ's sake, Van Damm,</i>

1117
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:59,294
take down that stupid sign
and let your public in.

1118
01:29:13,795 --> 01:29:16,295
Closed

1119
01:29:16,896 --> 01:29:19,896
We Never

1120
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,431
I thought so.

1121
01:30:35,920 --> 01:30:38,070
<i>You're going to ask me
to come down, aren't you?</i>

1122
01:30:38,120 --> 01:30:40,031
<i>I wouldn't dream of it.</i>

1123
01:30:42,880 --> 01:30:45,391
Now you know my secrets.

1124
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:46,829
Yes.

1125
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:49,558
And I know none of yours.

1126
01:30:49,600 --> 01:30:50,919
No.

1127
01:30:50,960 --> 01:30:52,518
Well...

1128
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,498
Actually, I think you do.

1129
01:30:58,760 --> 01:31:00,637
<i>We have made rather a goof it,
haven't we?</i>

1130
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:02,352
Yes.

1131
01:31:02,400 --> 01:31:05,949
<i>You're a very irritating woman but I
wouldn't have missed this for the world.</i>

1132
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:08,713
- I feel quite the same.
- Mm.

1133
01:31:09,200 --> 01:31:12,710
Even though you're
a very irritating man.

1134
01:31:15,440 --> 01:31:17,158
So, we'll continue?

1135
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:20,519
<i>I'm game if you are.
- Oh Yes</i>

1136
01:31:20,840 --> 01:31:24,056
It passes the time of day.

1137
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,070
<i>Let's watch the rest of the show.</i>

1138
01:31:29,120 --> 01:31:30,473
You go inside.

1139
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:32,556
I'll stand here for a while.

1140
01:31:32,600 --> 01:31:34,511
As you wish.

1141
01:31:36,920 --> 01:31:38,499
Would you fancy a dance?

1142
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:40,115
A dance? Where?

1143
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:41,875
Here.

1144
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:43,672
<i>Won't it be dangerous?</i>

1145
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:46,518
<i>You're quite right.
I'm a very cautious man. But...</i>

1146
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:50,012
<i>it won't be dangerous. Not Tonight</i>

1147
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:51,229
Just one dance.

1148
01:31:52,040 --> 01:31:54,315
- Mr Van Damm.
- Mrs Henderson.

1149
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:20,151
Ow! You've severed my toe.

1150
01:33:20,240 --> 01:33:22,595
<i>- Nonsense. I didn't touch it.
- You're rather clumsy.</i>

1151
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:24,870
<i>That's not something
you say to a dancing partner.</i>

1152
01:33:24,920 --> 01:33:27,354
You should take lessons
before issuing an invitation.

1153
01:33:27,400 --> 01:33:29,709
<i>I'm a very good dancer,
thank you very much.</i>

1154
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:41,035
In India only delicate men
are good dancers.

1155
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:42,991
The ungainly are not so.

1156
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:44,991
Listen, you old battleaxe...

1157
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,951
<i>Don't you dare speak to me like that.</i>

1158
01:33:46,952 --> 01:34:09,551
Laura Henderson died in 1944. In Her will
she left Windmill Theatre to Vivian Van Damn.
