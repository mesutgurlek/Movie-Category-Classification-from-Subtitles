1
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:28,916
Remove the scaffolds!

2
00:03:02,249 --> 00:03:02,950
And this one!

3
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:15,863
Andrea!

4
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,130
Nicola!

5
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:25,138
Those two are always
something special.

6
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:40,053
It's finished.

7
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,756
Let's get down.

8
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:52,099
To jump down?

9
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:04,945
A chair!

10
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,829
I'm sure those who built this,
after completing their job

11
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,599
they would have stood here to
admire it like I'm doing now.

12
00:04:28,468 --> 00:04:30,304
Those were great!

13
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,741
A miracle!

14
00:04:42,216 --> 00:04:45,152
Here's to you,
Church of the Miracles,

15
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:50,800
and to our ancestors who
built it a thousand years ago

16
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,127
and to those who transmitted
to us this craft of ours,

17
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:58,398
made by our hands
and by our imagination.

18
00:05:02,469 --> 00:05:04,771
Of course, I also drink
to your health

19
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:08,775
because you have restored
the facade to its former glory.

20
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:12,880
Please allow me to thank
my seven sons

21
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,082
who have been working with you

22
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:21,455
but, especially,
to raise my glass

23
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,892
to these two little rascals
over there

24
00:05:25,425 --> 00:05:26,827
the two youngest

25
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:30,364
who have hands of gold,
of real masters.

26
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:38,205
Yet all you have proved skilled
so you should not feel offended

27
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,440
If I praise those two too much.

28
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:43,510
That's fine, father...

29
00:05:44,244 --> 00:05:47,881
but you wanted us to reunite
in order to tell us something else

30
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,716
more important...

31
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:52,286
less pleasant...

32
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,326
Take it easy.

33
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:04,798
A son ought not to
upset his father.

34
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,636
I've decided to speak later

35
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:11,572
after the last dish.

36
00:06:27,688 --> 00:06:28,589
Father.

37
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:34,661
You have started
and I have to finish.

38
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,101
Duccio is right.

39
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:45,005
This is a farewell dinner.

40
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:49,610
The work we have just accomplished

41
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,112
will be the last.

42
00:06:55,349 --> 00:06:56,917
We are seriously struck by crisis.

43
00:06:57,117 --> 00:07:00,521
The firm is in so much debt
I have to shut it.

44
00:07:00,888 --> 00:07:04,358
My seven sons will decide
what to do, I will retire

45
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,027
in the countryside,
in the house where I was born.

46
00:07:08,195 --> 00:07:09,596
You do know all the rest, don't you?

47
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,267
Those things were up in the air.

48
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:18,772
No!
I didn't know fuck anything!

49
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,674
I am flabbergasted!

50
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:23,343
This was supposed to be a feast!

51
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,547
And to think that
I even bought a gift!

52
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,752
This is a funeral!

53
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:34,321
And for me, isn't it?

54
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,846
Forgive me.

55
00:08:12,493 --> 00:08:14,461
To our master!

56
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,100
So the brothers have decided
to sell off everything.

57
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,003
Yes, everything.
They'll open a great store.

58
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,471
And you, the children?

59
00:08:24,671 --> 00:08:26,073
Yes, the "children" too.

60
00:08:26,273 --> 00:08:29,009
We are to be vendors.
That will be enough.

61
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:32,746
This means you're going
to change profession?

62
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:38,185
All seven? Even the little
brothers with the hands of gold?

63
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:40,454
Yes. All seven.

64
00:08:47,794 --> 00:08:48,996
We're about to recheck the accounts.

65
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:51,031
Not so loud,
you'll wake up dad.

66
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:54,001
- We shouldn't give up.
- We have both thought it well.

67
00:08:56,036 --> 00:08:58,105
It's not in our interest to sell off.

68
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:01,175
The company can do without any workers.

69
00:09:01,408 --> 00:09:03,210
The seven of us are enough.

70
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:09,917
Let's clear the table.

71
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:14,054
For a year...
For a year, we won't take any pay.

72
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:17,157
You, Pietro!
Don't get married right away.

73
00:09:17,357 --> 00:09:20,861
And those who have family,
no more children!

74
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,230
Explain this to your wives!

75
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,064
Quiet!

76
00:09:26,366 --> 00:09:28,068
Are you afraid that father
may hear us?

77
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,074
Leave it to me.

78
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:34,908
Duccio!

79
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:37,644
Explain yourself!

80
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:40,781
You're worried because
today father retired.

81
00:09:41,014 --> 00:09:43,717
But we are both not!

82
00:10:05,572 --> 00:10:07,107
<i>Nicola and I went to see</i>

83
00:10:07,307 --> 00:10:09,092
<i>our father in his house
in the country,</i>

84
00:10:09,393 --> 00:10:10,677
<i>to say good buy...</i>

85
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:13,046
<i>We had decided to leave Italy</i>

86
00:10:13,547 --> 00:10:15,282
<i>and go to America.</i>

87
00:10:20,087 --> 00:10:23,157
We won't return until we earn enough dollars

88
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:25,893
to buy our company back.

89
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:29,429
One day we'll work together again
in our cathedrals.

90
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,664
- I swear to you!
- Me too!

91
00:10:34,334 --> 00:10:35,302
But you have to wait for us, father.

92
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:37,304
Do not die!

93
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,141
I will not.

94
00:10:42,809 --> 00:10:46,113
They say if want to stay young,
live like the young.

95
00:10:47,114 --> 00:10:48,448
So, I will stay a young man.

96
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,051
I swear to you!

97
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:57,357
What time is it in America?

98
00:10:57,558 --> 00:10:58,592
It is morning.

99
00:11:01,361 --> 00:11:03,730
Then, before going to sleep,

100
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:07,701
I will say to you: "Good morning
Andrea, good morning Nicola".

101
00:11:07,935 --> 00:11:08,969
And then in the evening

102
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,705
I will say: "Good morning
Andrea, good morning Nicola"

103
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:13,607
because it will make no difference.

104
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:17,878
You are two of you
and that's your force.

105
00:11:18,612 --> 00:11:20,547
On the condition that
you will always remain equal.

106
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,319
Otherwise, you will become enemies.

107
00:11:28,155 --> 00:11:29,556
Keep this in mind.

108
00:11:30,324 --> 00:11:32,259
Forever and ever be equal
to each other.

109
00:11:34,495 --> 00:11:36,129
This is your secret.

110
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:39,166
A secret known only by two,
is a secret kept by God.

111
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:45,072
Father, we are a little scared.

112
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,751
Good bye Italy!

113
00:12:31,485 --> 00:12:33,187
Fuck Italy!

114
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:29,543
- It seems we arrived.
- We're in America.

115
00:13:29,743 --> 00:13:31,178
Who said that?

116
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,649
We salute you, America!

117
00:14:09,116 --> 00:14:11,785
Bloody America, you'll become ours.

118
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,938
<i>Instead, America did not become ours.</i>

119
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:34,241
<i>Time past.
We moved from state to state</i>

120
00:14:34,608 --> 00:14:38,145
<i>while our jobs were getting more
temporary and more humiliating.</i>

121
00:14:50,524 --> 00:14:52,426
I miss four pigs!

122
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,495
Are they with yours, Andrea?

123
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:01,301
Ask me in English or I won't answer!

124
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,679
I'm going look for them.

125
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:16,950
Wait!

126
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:23,390
Where did you see them last?

127
00:15:25,526 --> 00:15:26,860
On "rich".

128
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,000
Not "rich", Nicola! "Ridge"!

129
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,003
It's no use, Andrea.

130
00:15:36,637 --> 00:15:38,138
It's not use at all.

131
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:41,408
No! If we only had
a better understanding

132
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,477
we would not end up here.

133
00:15:45,512 --> 00:15:47,481
And we shall end up here forever!

134
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:03,897
No, Nicola! Repeat after me!

135
00:16:04,598 --> 00:16:06,600
One, two, buckle the shoe!

136
00:16:10,571 --> 00:16:13,140
Three, four,
knock at the door!

137
00:16:13,373 --> 00:16:16,009
Five, six, pick up sticks!

138
00:16:38,198 --> 00:16:40,400
- They fell off the cliff!
- They eat each other!

139
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:42,002
Take the others away!

140
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:07,361
This is horrible!
Horrible!

141
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:50,838
Good morning, Andrea.

142
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:54,408
Good morning, Nicola.

143
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:59,072
What the hell they think they do?

144
00:18:59,673 --> 00:19:02,442
- Can you believe this?!
- The brakes are blocked, Jeff!

145
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:09,082
Just one moment!
One moment!

146
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:11,485
Sounds like foreigners to me.

147
00:19:13,954 --> 00:19:16,323
Just take it easy.
There's no point...

148
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:20,427
It's Okay, folks, we'll be off in
no time. Just get back and sit tight.

149
00:19:24,198 --> 00:19:27,467
It'll take some time to cool off.

150
00:21:24,985 --> 00:21:27,454
No, we're not choristers in the opera.

151
00:21:27,688 --> 00:21:29,490
Just a moment of nostalgia.

152
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:33,794
We are all craftsmen,
sculptors, plasterers, masons,

153
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:34,728
carpenters,

154
00:21:34,928 --> 00:21:36,230
and painters.

155
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:40,234
We're going to San Francisco,
to the Great International Expo

156
00:21:40,434 --> 00:21:42,202
to mount the Italian flag.

157
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:44,972
He and me are foremen.

158
00:21:45,172 --> 00:21:49,376
We came directly from Italy.
The others were already here.

159
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:56,383
- What about the two of you?
- We are craftsmen like you.

160
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:57,751
From Tuscany.

161
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:00,587
We are the ones who restored

162
00:22:00,787 --> 00:22:02,322
the Church of the Miracles.

163
00:22:02,523 --> 00:22:03,190
Well, then...

164
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,425
what are you doing here?

165
00:22:06,727 --> 00:22:07,861
We...

166
00:22:08,962 --> 00:22:09,930
We...

167
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,100
I can't hear you well...

168
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:14,968
But what are you doing here?

169
00:22:52,372 --> 00:22:53,240
Boys!

170
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,441
Come and see!

171
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:37,551
<i>We did ourselves proud.</i>

172
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:39,953
<i>All the Italians did themselves proud</i>

173
00:23:40,154 --> 00:23:41,121
<i>that year in San Francisco.</i>

174
00:23:41,321 --> 00:23:43,624
<i>We were the heroes of the hour.
Nobody talked of anything</i>

175
00:23:43,824 --> 00:23:47,027
<i>but us and our "Tower of Jewels"</i>

176
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:56,303
Italian Foremen With Their Workers

177
00:23:59,006 --> 00:24:01,975
<i>We worked there as their laborers.
We made some money</i>

178
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:04,711
<i>and bought ourselves
some fancy new suits.</i>

179
00:24:07,247 --> 00:24:09,283
<i>At the Expo, they were showing</i>

180
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:13,320
<i>the motion picture "Cabiria",
another great Italian success!</i>

181
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:18,158
<i>There was one man in the crowd wanted
to see the picture again at once.</i>

182
00:24:18,826 --> 00:24:22,729
<i>By himself.
He paid for the theatre and orchestra.</i>

183
00:24:28,535 --> 00:24:32,639
<i>That man, destined to have
a great influence over our lives,</i>

184
00:24:32,873 --> 00:24:35,108
<i>was the most famous
film-director in all of America.</i>

185
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:38,111
<i>D.W. Griffith.</i>

186
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:45,719
Send a wire:

187
00:24:48,489 --> 00:24:52,826
"To Pastrone, director
of 'Cabiria', Italy.

188
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:57,865
Your picture

189
00:24:59,533 --> 00:25:02,669
is greater than all of mine.

190
00:25:14,748 --> 00:25:17,484
"Tonight,
you made me realize

191
00:25:17,684 --> 00:25:22,222
the film I am shooting
is taking me off course.

192
00:25:22,956 --> 00:25:24,424
I am cancelling it."

193
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:28,996
He said "cancel", Mr. Grass?

194
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:32,966
We already... we already
made the calls for Monday.

195
00:25:33,167 --> 00:25:34,735
That's right! A hundred
extras, six automobiles...

196
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:37,171
- Won't we rehearse the actors?
- Wait a minute, just shut up.

197
00:25:38,172 --> 00:25:39,373
Enough!

198
00:25:46,674 --> 00:25:51,574
"And I don't know whether to
be grateful or... I hate you.

199
00:25:52,252 --> 00:25:53,787
D.W. Griffith."

200
00:26:04,565 --> 00:26:05,666
Never mind.

201
00:26:07,568 --> 00:26:10,237
Artists communicate through their work.

202
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:11,538
There he is!

203
00:26:12,506 --> 00:26:14,541
- Have the Italians done it again?
- How does it compare?

204
00:26:14,641 --> 00:26:16,910
What impressed you most
about "Cabiria"?

205
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:20,180
Everything!

206
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:22,883
Everything? Could you be
a little more specific?

207
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,118
A sequence? Or an image?

208
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,021
The elephant.

209
00:26:29,623 --> 00:26:31,291
The black elephant!

210
00:26:31,558 --> 00:26:34,127
Thompson, will you bring Mrs. Griffith?

211
00:26:34,328 --> 00:26:37,998
Is it true that you plan to stop
production of your present film?

212
00:26:41,201 --> 00:26:42,236
It is!

213
00:26:49,843 --> 00:26:50,511
A disaster!

214
00:26:52,312 --> 00:26:54,615
- Stroke of luck!
- How's that, sir?

215
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:58,819
I shall transform it!
You write this down!

216
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:02,189
It will become part of a fresco.

217
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,011
Then you resume production...

218
00:27:04,259 --> 00:27:06,051
...along the lines of the
Italian "Cabiria", sir?

219
00:27:06,219 --> 00:27:08,722
Three hundred times
greater than "Cabiria"!

220
00:27:18,272 --> 00:27:21,175
Are you thinking about your old idea?

221
00:27:25,112 --> 00:27:28,816
"Intolerance", I can always tell
when it crops up in your head.

222
00:27:51,104 --> 00:27:52,339
Get closer!

223
00:27:57,311 --> 00:28:00,714
David, what are you doing?
It's pouring!

224
00:28:09,089 --> 00:28:10,390
Who built this?

225
00:28:10,591 --> 00:28:11,625
The Italians!

226
00:28:11,925 --> 00:28:14,127
It's the Italian pavilion,
Mr. Griffith!

227
00:28:14,361 --> 00:28:18,065
Italians, M. Griffith!
It's always the Italians!

228
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:20,701
Those endowed Italians!

229
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:23,504
I want them.

230
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:35,115
They must be gone
by now, Mr. Griffith!

231
00:28:35,315 --> 00:28:37,084
They finished build
the expo a month or so!

232
00:28:37,284 --> 00:28:39,423
I want the man who built this!

233
00:28:39,644 --> 00:28:41,502
He'll have to go to work for me!

234
00:28:42,123 --> 00:28:45,021
I want the construction
foreman, Mr. Grass!

235
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:51,331
"Intolerance!"

236
00:28:56,804 --> 00:28:58,949
The two artists you want
they're leaving for Italy today

237
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,574
with most of their workers!

238
00:29:00,841 --> 00:29:02,759
I know because they are
members of this Italian club.

239
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,077
The two foremen who worked in the expo!

240
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:07,781
Look! If you leave your number
I will try to get in touch.

241
00:29:09,684 --> 00:29:12,152
You are calling from where?
Hollywood?

242
00:29:12,352 --> 00:29:14,721
To make elephants?
For whom?

243
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:16,824
Griffith?

244
00:29:19,026 --> 00:29:20,727
One moment, hold on.

245
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:23,700
No good! They got as many
workers as they need.

246
00:29:23,831 --> 00:29:25,432
They just want the two foremen!

247
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:30,037
Alright, if I happen to find anything,
who should I call?

248
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:33,474
Ah, sent them to Frisco...

249
00:29:33,674 --> 00:29:35,509
- And then?
- They want Teodoro and Amilcare.

250
00:29:38,479 --> 00:29:39,847
We can find them!

251
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:42,282
They sail for Seattle in an hour.

252
00:29:43,183 --> 00:29:44,585
Maybe we can stop them.

253
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:05,038
We'll be too late.

254
00:30:08,041 --> 00:30:08,876
Better.

255
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:16,016
If they've left,
we can try ourselves.

256
00:30:18,051 --> 00:30:19,686
Then my shoe came untied...

257
00:30:24,491 --> 00:30:25,993
Both mine are too.

258
00:30:59,359 --> 00:31:01,028
God, I'm sorry!

259
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:13,207
But I'm glad too!

260
00:31:17,244 --> 00:31:20,113
- Well, you guys are...
- The foremen the director wants!

261
00:31:20,314 --> 00:31:22,216
The director's name is Griffith, right?

262
00:31:23,684 --> 00:31:24,785
Your names?

263
00:31:27,721 --> 00:31:29,323
Amilcare Martini.

264
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:30,824
Teodoro Benvenuti.

265
00:31:31,391 --> 00:31:32,893
Okay, hop in "paisans"!

266
00:31:33,093 --> 00:31:34,828
The day after tomorrow
you'll be in Hollywood.

267
00:31:35,028 --> 00:31:38,098
Don't forget to fill up in Salinas!

268
00:32:08,829 --> 00:32:12,533
I leave you here. The tram will take
you straight to Mr. Grass's office.

269
00:32:12,766 --> 00:32:16,003
He's the production manager
of Mr. Griffith. See you around!

270
00:32:30,184 --> 00:32:31,785
My sons, oh my sons!

271
00:32:37,324 --> 00:32:40,561
Yes, my sons I awaked you.

272
00:32:54,408 --> 00:32:55,609
Where are we?

273
00:33:09,523 --> 00:33:12,259
Alright, all the dead get down!

274
00:33:15,395 --> 00:33:16,597
Perfectly still!

275
00:33:17,397 --> 00:33:19,166
The King to the throne!

276
00:33:20,534 --> 00:33:22,202
Slowly, slowly!

277
00:33:22,803 --> 00:33:24,671
Get the sons on horseback!

278
00:33:26,573 --> 00:33:28,075
Alright, roll it!

279
00:33:29,042 --> 00:33:30,377
Action!

280
00:34:12,853 --> 00:34:14,488
Go, my sons!

281
00:34:15,055 --> 00:34:16,990
I shall wait for you here.

282
00:34:19,993 --> 00:34:22,262
We have been defeated

283
00:34:25,532 --> 00:34:27,100
but when you return

284
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,170
you will win back my kingdom.

285
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,184
Look, Andrea.

286
00:34:45,285 --> 00:34:46,720
The old king is crying.

287
00:35:19,853 --> 00:35:21,021
You kids new?

288
00:35:23,922 --> 00:35:25,522
- Have a piece!
- Thank you!

289
00:35:25,692 --> 00:35:28,962
Please, listen, give us a chance!
We're dancers.

290
00:35:29,163 --> 00:35:30,397
Yes, and very good ones.

291
00:35:31,198 --> 00:35:33,300
We can't be extras all our lives!

292
00:35:33,534 --> 00:35:35,169
Look girls, it's not up to me.

293
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:37,304
Even you don't believe us.

294
00:35:38,205 --> 00:35:39,506
Well, can you do a split?

295
00:36:17,711 --> 00:36:20,180
It's Griffith!
He's trying a new machine.

296
00:36:26,453 --> 00:36:27,020
Where's Griffith?

297
00:36:27,955 --> 00:36:29,990
It's the man upon the crane
with the big white hat.

298
00:36:31,625 --> 00:36:33,327
Good morning to you, Mr. Thompson.

299
00:36:43,637 --> 00:36:44,872
We are the Italians!

300
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:13,033
Destroy it! Mr. Griffith says he
doesn't even want the tail!

301
00:37:17,704 --> 00:37:19,139
So you two are the
famous Italian builders?

302
00:37:22,209 --> 00:37:24,745
You're here to make elephants
for "Intolerance".

303
00:37:27,114 --> 00:37:30,284
Not one of our drawings has met with
the approval of Mr. Griffith.

304
00:37:31,084 --> 00:37:34,354
But you Italians think
you can do better.

305
00:37:34,788 --> 00:37:35,622
Great.

306
00:37:36,123 --> 00:37:37,191
Remember what they did
up in Frisco!

307
00:37:37,825 --> 00:37:38,992
I know, I know.

308
00:38:01,248 --> 00:38:04,451
I see Hollywood agrees with you
my dear architects.

309
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:07,087
You look thirty years younger...

310
00:38:10,157 --> 00:38:11,558
We thought we...

311
00:38:14,027 --> 00:38:15,429
Can we sit down?

312
00:38:20,367 --> 00:38:21,869
Have you been in the service?

313
00:38:26,173 --> 00:38:31,245
Then on your feet. About face!
Forward, march!

314
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:52,166
Actors and extras on set!
Take your positions!

315
00:38:52,833 --> 00:38:56,503
No, enough! Come on!
Hurry up, please!

316
00:38:57,971 --> 00:39:00,708
You two, girls!
Aren't you extras?

317
00:39:01,675 --> 00:39:03,911
Extras! Extras!

318
00:39:15,889 --> 00:39:17,691
I'm sorry I got you in trouble!

319
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:20,727
I always go and open my big mouth.

320
00:39:41,281 --> 00:39:44,418
Steve, finish up here by tonight.
Tomorrow I'm pulling it.

321
00:39:44,651 --> 00:39:46,920
I got to get the new
sets for Griffith ready.

322
00:39:50,357 --> 00:39:50,991
You're still here.

323
00:39:52,993 --> 00:39:55,762
We were wrong, Mr. Grass.
We have to pay.

324
00:39:57,197 --> 00:39:58,432
We need the job!

325
00:39:59,766 --> 00:40:00,968
Any kind of job.

326
00:40:02,302 --> 00:40:03,137
Sure.

327
00:40:05,772 --> 00:40:08,275
No, no!
I know you "wops"!

328
00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:13,046
Liars, swindlers,
allergic to work...

329
00:40:15,516 --> 00:40:19,186
Belly in the sun
and hands on your belly!

330
00:40:32,432 --> 00:40:35,903
These hands have restored the cathedrals of Pisa,

331
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:38,105
Lucca and Florence!

332
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:43,010
Whose son are you...

333
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:44,745
We are the sons
of the sons of the sons

334
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:47,247
of Michelangelo and Leonardo!

335
00:40:48,348 --> 00:40:50,017
Whose son are you?

336
00:41:01,795 --> 00:41:03,163
No, excuse us!

337
00:41:03,997 --> 00:41:06,099
We're only here to ask for jobs.

338
00:41:07,768 --> 00:41:09,069
Viva Firenze!

339
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:18,045
Viva Firenze!

340
00:41:20,881 --> 00:41:22,850
We were in Florence once!

341
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,885
It's the most beautiful place
in the world!

342
00:41:26,086 --> 00:41:27,321
Viva Firenze!

343
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:31,925
- The sun's going!
- Will you take your places?

344
00:42:08,695 --> 00:42:10,030
You go by the train station?

345
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:12,399
No, next car!
After midnight.

346
00:42:20,774 --> 00:42:22,309
There those two boys again.

347
00:42:26,013 --> 00:42:27,047
It's them.

348
00:44:12,753 --> 00:44:14,321
Do you guys take care birds?

349
00:44:15,622 --> 00:44:16,423
Birds?

350
00:44:22,429 --> 00:44:23,630
Then I got a job for you!
Hop in!

351
00:44:30,037 --> 00:44:32,639
We got a hundred birds for a scene
we're shooting in a couple of weeks.

352
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,342
Just feed them and clean
the cages, morning and night.

353
00:44:35,576 --> 00:44:38,245
During the day I'll try to find you
some more jobs around the set.

354
00:44:39,346 --> 00:44:42,316
On night you can sleep
in the birdhouse.

355
00:44:45,752 --> 00:44:49,223
This is it. You can get out.
The door is open.

356
00:44:59,933 --> 00:45:01,635
What's the matter?
You're scared?

357
00:45:12,479 --> 00:45:14,047
We ain't even
the time to thanks!

358
00:45:35,169 --> 00:45:36,737
What the stink!

359
00:46:05,365 --> 00:46:09,036
I'd die of pity for
somebody like you and me.

360
00:46:17,511 --> 00:46:19,379
Good morning, father.

361
00:46:33,293 --> 00:46:36,430
Movies are light.
You're not on a stage.

362
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:38,465
When the light hits your face

363
00:46:38,665 --> 00:46:41,568
not from a light bulb
but natural, true sunlight,

364
00:46:42,236 --> 00:46:45,906
when you feel it, the audience
has to feel it with you.

365
00:46:46,373 --> 00:46:47,508
Now, get up.

366
00:46:50,410 --> 00:46:52,246
And take your places.

367
00:46:55,749 --> 00:46:58,786
- The sun? Where's going to be coming from?
- I don't know.

368
00:46:59,453 --> 00:47:02,656
From up above. There are two
people in front of those panels.

369
00:47:16,637 --> 00:47:17,371
Is it time?

370
00:47:31,285 --> 00:47:33,086
Roll it!

371
00:49:08,549 --> 00:49:11,752
"Air is the thing around
your head that...

372
00:49:13,487 --> 00:49:14,955
"becomes...

373
00:49:21,595 --> 00:49:24,064
lighter when you laugh."

374
00:49:31,605 --> 00:49:32,739
Shut up!

375
00:49:35,075 --> 00:49:36,677
For you, it's night!

376
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:40,114
"You're as beautiful...

377
00:49:43,383 --> 00:49:45,319
as a snowy mountain."

378
00:49:49,389 --> 00:49:51,859
"Beautiful as a snowy mountain."

379
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,062
"I'll put you in my shadow,

380
00:49:55,295 --> 00:49:56,930
to keep you from melting."

381
00:50:04,271 --> 00:50:06,106
How're we going to deliver them?

382
00:50:47,881 --> 00:50:49,283
"Sometimes I fall in...

383
00:50:52,519 --> 00:50:55,389
"Sometimes I fall in to your eyes...

384
00:50:56,824 --> 00:50:58,659
who knows where I end up."

385
00:51:03,030 --> 00:51:07,234
Oh, we're all friends...
Edna!

386
00:51:09,903 --> 00:51:11,071
Oh, read another one!

387
00:51:11,939 --> 00:51:16,743
"I should like to be the
petal of a giant flower

388
00:51:17,111 --> 00:51:19,012
where you rest your head."

389
00:51:23,517 --> 00:51:24,718
"You are as beautiful...

390
00:51:25,686 --> 00:51:27,588
as a snowy mountain."

391
00:51:28,822 --> 00:51:31,458
"I should put you
in my shadow...

392
00:51:31,658 --> 00:51:33,827
to keep from melting."

393
00:51:34,461 --> 00:51:35,662
Shakespeare!

394
00:51:42,035 --> 00:51:44,271
Two snowy mountains,
coming up!

395
00:51:47,207 --> 00:51:48,842
Not the wrong color!
Get them out of here!

396
00:51:49,910 --> 00:51:51,912
I said white horses!

397
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,250
White!
Like two snowy mountains!

398
00:51:56,784 --> 00:51:57,985
It's Okay?

399
00:51:58,185 --> 00:52:01,622
Yeah, now get down here,
we will shoot it!

400
00:52:12,534 --> 00:52:16,219
David, watch out!
You'll melt like a snowy mountain!

401
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,784
Come here!

402
00:52:20,641 --> 00:52:23,944
Stay close where I am,
let me keep in my shadow!

403
00:52:24,545 --> 00:52:26,847
"Keep you in my shadow"?

404
00:52:27,347 --> 00:52:29,783
Are we speaking in verse today?
Eh, my dear?

405
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,908
"Andrea and Nicola invite Edna
and Mabel to lunch tomorrow

406
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:56,743
in the birdhouse."

407
00:52:59,179 --> 00:53:01,515
Remember what we promised
each other...

408
00:53:02,149 --> 00:53:03,150
We only go out with...

409
00:53:03,350 --> 00:53:05,719
directors or producers.

410
00:53:09,323 --> 00:53:11,125
What a lot of laughs!

411
00:53:14,228 --> 00:53:15,629
They're here.

412
00:53:18,565 --> 00:53:21,735
Mr. Grass and company,
rather on the dot.

413
00:53:22,069 --> 00:53:24,638
Listen, what if we asked
them for a rain check?

414
00:53:24,838 --> 00:53:26,807
We can still get to
the woods some time...

415
00:53:27,074 --> 00:53:28,075
Oh, forget it Mabel.

416
00:53:28,308 --> 00:53:30,811
Getting involved with Nicola
and Andrea would be like...

417
00:53:31,512 --> 00:53:33,947
like building houses on quicksand.

418
00:53:34,481 --> 00:53:38,552
Those two are losers!
Poor guys.

419
00:53:41,522 --> 00:53:44,858
- We're late.
- Oh, let them wait!

420
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:49,863
Oh, just look at those lips!

421
00:53:50,564 --> 00:53:51,802
Whenever they chap like that,

422
00:53:51,953 --> 00:53:54,401
I just know something
is going to go wrong.

423
00:53:55,936 --> 00:54:00,140
Let me tell you,
the best medicine is to laugh!

424
00:54:33,307 --> 00:54:34,708
I wish I wasn't here!

425
00:54:44,118 --> 00:54:45,819
We have the money to go back.

426
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:49,089
Yes, but just enough to go back.

427
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:51,291
What will we tell father?

428
00:55:08,342 --> 00:55:10,978
I wish I was back home
in the square playing in the bands.

429
00:55:30,898 --> 00:55:32,800
What we do now, huh?

430
00:56:33,994 --> 00:56:36,797
G. Rossini
"The Thieving Magpie"

431
00:58:40,754 --> 00:58:43,157
This is the elephant
Griffith has been waiting for.

432
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:46,727
We will build one for him,
standing up, life-size!

433
01:01:35,896 --> 01:01:37,331
They build that?

434
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,003
No, I can't believe it.
It's too beautiful!

435
01:02:38,392 --> 01:02:41,862
What are you doing?
Are you not going undress?

436
01:02:42,863 --> 01:02:44,398
I took off my vest.

437
01:02:46,266 --> 01:02:49,736
A person wants to smell skin...

438
01:02:53,841 --> 01:02:54,975
I know but...

439
01:02:56,877 --> 01:02:58,011
I'm ashamed.

440
01:02:58,545 --> 01:03:00,414
What about me, then?

441
01:03:04,885 --> 01:03:07,054
A woman's body
is always beautiful!

442
01:03:12,760 --> 01:03:13,627
At least your boots!

443
01:03:19,566 --> 01:03:20,868
I told you!

444
01:03:49,897 --> 01:03:52,065
It's good to be with you, Andrea!

445
01:03:54,668 --> 01:03:58,472
You know some times I feel
like I am with two people.

446
01:03:59,106 --> 01:04:02,643
You know, Edna and me, we're
friends too, but it's different.

447
01:04:02,876 --> 01:04:06,246
But with you there's something more.
You two always together,

448
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,514
same,

449
01:04:08,782 --> 01:04:10,617
always equal to each-other.

450
01:04:11,151 --> 01:04:13,187
No...

451
01:04:22,863 --> 01:04:25,385
Now tell me what
you were about to say.

452
01:04:25,516 --> 01:04:26,767
Please tell me!

453
01:04:28,435 --> 01:04:33,173
I was thinking about a time that
Nicola and I were not equal as you say.

454
01:04:34,741 --> 01:04:38,512
We were about nine and ten,
and both had

455
01:04:39,246 --> 01:04:41,014
two cents in our pockets.

456
01:04:42,916 --> 01:04:44,952
We bought a ticket apiece.

457
01:04:45,552 --> 01:04:47,688
Nicola got number 18.

458
01:04:48,655 --> 01:04:50,023
I got 50.

459
01:04:54,328 --> 01:04:55,963
18 came out!

460
01:04:57,364 --> 01:05:00,000
Nicola got his beautiful Spanish knife.

461
01:05:03,137 --> 01:05:04,905
Chance has favored just one of us.

462
01:05:05,105 --> 01:05:09,676
Our strength, our equality
had been destroyed.

463
01:05:29,563 --> 01:05:31,498
Why did you tell my this story?

464
01:05:32,299 --> 01:05:33,467
To scare me?

465
01:05:34,234 --> 01:05:35,035
No!

466
01:05:37,137 --> 01:05:39,907
To make you realize
how much you mean to me.

467
01:05:41,208 --> 01:05:43,577
You're the first person I told it to.

468
01:05:51,552 --> 01:05:53,220
The scar's over here!

469
01:05:57,524 --> 01:05:59,259
This is the scar?

470
01:06:06,100 --> 01:06:09,736
Yes, but don't tell Andrea that
I told you this story, my love.

471
01:06:10,237 --> 01:06:12,439
He'll never forgive me.

472
01:06:17,778 --> 01:06:19,847
<i>Those were happy days.</i>

473
01:06:20,080 --> 01:06:22,916
<i>Edna and Mabel introduced
us to their friends</i>

474
01:06:23,117 --> 01:06:26,220
<i>people from all over the world,
who had come to work in the movies.</i>

475
01:06:26,487 --> 01:06:28,222
<i>One evening they came to see us</i>

476
01:06:28,353 --> 01:06:30,758
<i>and we took them to see our elephant.</i>

477
01:06:31,225 --> 01:06:33,194
<i>Was it worthy to be
shown to Griffith?</i>

478
01:06:37,698 --> 01:06:39,700
It's a little gray,
isn't it?

479
01:06:40,200 --> 01:06:41,268
An elephant is gray.

480
01:06:41,468 --> 01:06:44,238
It's true to reality,
but it won't stand on a film.

481
01:06:44,438 --> 01:06:46,506
If it was lightened, Andrea,
I'd shoot some test of it.

482
01:06:46,637 --> 01:06:47,874
- Then, we'll see.
- Yeah, right.

483
01:06:48,876 --> 01:06:52,079
It'll be day soon,
in a couple of hours.

484
01:06:52,746 --> 01:06:53,747
Why are we not waiting for dawn?

485
01:06:54,148 --> 01:06:57,050
Oh, yeah!
Let's wait. Please, Sean!

486
01:06:57,284 --> 01:06:59,119
I've never saw the sunrise
up in the woods!

487
01:06:59,319 --> 01:07:01,655
If I'm going to shoot this thing,
I want it perfect

488
01:07:01,889 --> 01:07:03,924
So who's going to give me a hand
to whitewash this monster?

489
01:07:06,660 --> 01:07:09,797
Listen, let's make a circle
of candles all around it.

490
01:07:11,098 --> 01:07:13,867
A circle of candles
around the elephant!

491
01:07:54,942 --> 01:07:58,178
- How's the light, Okay?
- Yeah, just about.

492
01:08:04,818 --> 01:08:06,954
I'm sorry, folks.

493
01:08:08,188 --> 01:08:10,691
I guess I [...] to drink a little.

494
01:08:15,996 --> 01:08:18,899
Just what I wanted to say is...

495
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:21,802
Oh, anyhow!

496
01:08:22,003 --> 01:08:23,704
Who knows where we'll be

497
01:08:23,972 --> 01:08:26,604
in ten, twenty years from now?

498
01:08:32,179 --> 01:08:35,349
Let's just promise

499
01:08:36,483 --> 01:08:39,820
never to forget the way we are now.

500
01:08:40,487 --> 01:08:41,955
Together,

501
01:08:43,857 --> 01:08:46,293
and how we are helping each other.

502
01:08:46,627 --> 01:08:48,262
Oh dear, I...

503
01:08:49,296 --> 01:08:52,699
What I mean
is that's why...

504
01:08:53,066 --> 01:08:55,369
the movies for me

505
01:08:57,938 --> 01:09:02,076
this Hollywood of ours

506
01:09:02,476 --> 01:09:03,777
it's so wonderful...

507
01:09:04,044 --> 01:09:05,712
because you...

508
01:09:05,946 --> 01:09:08,849
I mean we...

509
01:09:10,784 --> 01:09:13,020
Isn't it lightened enough yet?

510
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:17,758
Is it time?

511
01:10:16,150 --> 01:10:17,785
Those two degos!

512
01:10:18,552 --> 01:10:20,120
A real flop!

513
01:10:24,591 --> 01:10:25,292
It's a masterpiece.

514
01:10:36,336 --> 01:10:38,238
A masterpiece.

515
01:10:38,439 --> 01:10:40,574
Should we take it to Mr. Griffith?

516
01:12:29,981 --> 01:12:31,251
Stop it!

517
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:35,055
You're going to leave
from here for good!

518
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:37,578
Hey you guys
give me a hand!

519
01:12:49,303 --> 01:12:51,538
- We need to do something!
- Don't worry.

520
01:12:54,274 --> 01:12:56,076
You wanted to work in
the movies, didn't you?

521
01:12:56,944 --> 01:12:59,079
Well, we didn't test
these chains before!

522
01:13:49,463 --> 01:13:50,697
Is he looking at it?

523
01:14:22,963 --> 01:14:26,100
I want eight of those elephants.
They're wonderful!

524
01:14:26,300 --> 01:14:29,503
But the two Italian guys
made it they have... gone away.

525
01:14:30,037 --> 01:14:31,071
Gone where?

526
01:14:32,539 --> 01:14:33,474
To jail.

527
01:14:34,141 --> 01:14:35,309
You're kidding!

528
01:14:37,644 --> 01:14:40,481
- What did they do?
- They got in a fight.

529
01:14:42,716 --> 01:14:45,419
- With who?
- Ask me!

530
01:14:46,820 --> 01:14:48,355
With your production man!

531
01:14:58,265 --> 01:15:01,869
Get those two delinquents out of
bail at once and bring them to me.

532
01:15:49,550 --> 01:15:51,752
This is mine.
That's yours.

533
01:15:52,286 --> 01:15:54,621
Sure.
They are the same.

534
01:15:58,392 --> 01:16:01,495
I'll look funny sitting
behind a desk like this.

535
01:16:03,997 --> 01:16:04,865
Me too.

536
01:16:11,805 --> 01:16:14,141
If our father could see us now...

537
01:16:21,248 --> 01:16:23,751
Now, we can bring him over.

538
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:27,921
In a moment!

539
01:16:40,567 --> 01:16:41,835
Who told you to come in?

540
01:16:43,237 --> 01:16:44,271
I knocked!

541
01:16:47,674 --> 01:16:49,076
Were you on the service?

542
01:16:50,043 --> 01:16:50,778
Sure!

543
01:16:51,044 --> 01:16:54,915
Then, about face!
Forward, march!

544
01:17:10,097 --> 01:17:11,899
About face!

545
01:17:12,499 --> 01:17:14,501
Forward, march!

546
01:18:03,383 --> 01:18:05,152
Are these for the bride and groom?

547
01:18:05,352 --> 01:18:08,255
- No, for Mr. Griffith and Bonani!
- Mr. Bonani, right.

548
01:18:08,789 --> 01:18:11,458
They wanted their father
to be here too.

549
01:18:11,658 --> 01:18:12,726
We got important guests, today!

550
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:16,864
Oh, Mr. Griffith loves these
boys like the apple of his eye.

551
01:18:17,831 --> 01:18:20,100
Who is this Italian father, anyway?

552
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:23,337
- Oh, some great artist from Tuscany.
- What’s his name?

553
01:18:23,537 --> 01:18:26,740
Michael-Angelo, or, Raphael!

554
01:18:26,940 --> 01:18:29,576
Raphael?
Yeah, I have heard of him.

555
01:18:29,777 --> 01:18:31,211
I thought he was dead.

556
01:18:34,548 --> 01:18:35,949
Here they come.

557
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,268
Do you like it?

558
01:18:54,468 --> 01:18:55,602
Yes, it's beautiful.

559
01:18:55,803 --> 01:18:58,305
This is our theater.

560
01:18:58,505 --> 01:18:59,640
Let's move on.

561
01:19:00,941 --> 01:19:01,875
Come on!

562
01:19:03,977 --> 01:19:07,181
This banquet of ours
is offered by our boss.

563
01:19:07,381 --> 01:19:08,882
Mr. Griffith.

564
01:19:10,617 --> 01:19:11,652
There he is.

565
01:19:17,858 --> 01:19:19,526
He is coming to welcome you.

566
01:19:29,336 --> 01:19:30,938
Hand me this stick.

567
01:19:39,246 --> 01:19:40,681
I'll go alone.

568
01:19:49,423 --> 01:19:51,058
I've never noticed he limped.

569
01:19:51,258 --> 01:19:52,626
He does it on purpose.

570
01:19:52,826 --> 01:19:54,027
On purpose?

571
01:19:54,995 --> 01:19:56,864
He wants to seem even older.

572
01:20:04,838 --> 01:20:07,107
Who's going to greet the other first?

573
01:20:32,299 --> 01:20:34,935
Good morning, maestro.

574
01:20:55,089 --> 01:20:58,625
May I make the boldest
and ask your age, sir?

575
01:20:59,626 --> 01:21:01,462
How old are you?

576
01:21:03,831 --> 01:21:05,733
Ninety.

577
01:21:08,469 --> 01:21:10,637
Ninety? seventy!

578
01:21:28,638 --> 01:21:30,238
What's he doing?

579
01:21:30,867 --> 01:21:33,625
This is the sign of blessing
of our ancestors.

580
01:21:36,363 --> 01:21:37,264
For you, Mabel.

581
01:21:38,298 --> 01:21:39,867
And for you, Edna.

582
01:21:41,502 --> 01:21:44,405
And for you, my sons.

583
01:21:45,706 --> 01:21:47,606
It's a traditional blessing.

584
01:21:47,841 --> 01:21:51,945
It's for Mabel and Edna
and, of course, for the sons.

585
01:21:59,887 --> 01:22:01,688
Maybe I am a bad person

586
01:22:02,823 --> 01:22:04,224
but I want to tell the truth.

587
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,429
I blessed my two sons.

588
01:22:09,196 --> 01:22:10,998
I should have not.

589
01:22:12,166 --> 01:22:14,101
You have not honored your promise

590
01:22:17,538 --> 01:22:19,473
to depart in order to return,

591
01:22:21,642 --> 01:22:24,078
to work in a foreign land

592
01:22:25,946 --> 01:22:29,950
but your earnings to help
a new start in your own country

593
01:22:31,285 --> 01:22:33,320
in the profession of your father

594
01:22:34,788 --> 01:22:36,557
and your grandfather

595
01:22:37,991 --> 01:22:41,829
and your other ancestors
who built our cathedrals.

596
01:22:45,299 --> 01:22:46,934
But this old man waited in vain

597
01:22:47,968 --> 01:22:50,704
for his sons to honor their promise.

598
01:23:03,784 --> 01:23:04,985
Say something.

599
01:23:30,544 --> 01:23:33,313
Maybe it's not my place to speak.

600
01:23:34,381 --> 01:23:37,584
I'm not a son or a relative

601
01:23:38,919 --> 01:23:42,222
nor have I ninety summers on my head

602
01:23:42,423 --> 01:23:44,725
like you've seen, Bonani.

603
01:23:47,394 --> 01:23:48,629
But like you

604
01:23:49,763 --> 01:23:52,066
I'm used to say what I think.

605
01:23:53,267 --> 01:23:56,904
I don't know whether our work,

606
01:23:57,104 --> 01:24:00,274
that of your sons and mine

607
01:24:01,008 --> 01:24:03,210
is as fine as that of those

608
01:24:03,444 --> 01:24:05,779
who built your Romanesque cathedrals.

609
01:24:07,314 --> 01:24:11,418
I do know that those works were born

610
01:24:12,086 --> 01:24:14,221
as these are born today

611
01:24:15,322 --> 01:24:18,992
of the same collective dream.

612
01:24:21,028 --> 01:24:24,565
I believe that your sons, Bonani,

613
01:24:25,432 --> 01:24:26,934
are like those obscure stonecutters

614
01:24:27,167 --> 01:24:30,137
who carved their masterpieces

615
01:24:30,337 --> 01:24:33,040
on the cathedrals you honor,

616
01:24:34,208 --> 01:24:37,511
who contributed and make
them famous with their art

617
01:24:39,146 --> 01:24:42,683
and who helped their
neighbor to believe

618
01:24:43,784 --> 01:24:45,853
and to live better.

619
01:24:46,954 --> 01:24:48,355
This is why

620
01:24:48,789 --> 01:24:51,058
I love movie-making...

621
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,629
and I respect it, Bonani.

622
01:25:06,473 --> 01:25:08,375
You can tell I used to be an actor.

623
01:25:10,043 --> 01:25:13,514
I've done a little of everything
in my life

624
01:25:13,714 --> 01:25:16,817
but I've never given a
better performance than today.

625
01:25:19,153 --> 01:25:20,721
Ladies and gentlemen...

626
01:26:31,759 --> 01:26:33,093
The elephants!

627
01:26:47,241 --> 01:26:49,443
- How tall you think they are?
- The elephants?

628
01:26:49,643 --> 01:26:53,180
The columns are 90 feet high,
the elephants 50!

629
01:26:53,781 --> 01:26:55,682
They weigh 5 tons each!

630
01:27:16,804 --> 01:27:18,872
Thank you, Mr. Griffith!

631
01:27:21,542 --> 01:27:22,810
Stop the war!

632
01:27:25,179 --> 01:27:26,780
We want peace!

633
01:28:47,027 --> 01:28:48,762
I'm fine.

634
01:29:18,125 --> 01:29:20,494
- Where to?
- Home, please!

635
01:29:20,728 --> 01:29:21,695
Where's that?

636
01:29:24,098 --> 01:29:26,133
- The address?
- No, to the hospital!

637
01:29:27,634 --> 01:29:28,936
Don't lose them!

638
01:29:32,005 --> 01:29:33,107
Go faster!

639
01:29:37,778 --> 01:29:41,782
Don't laugh but I don't
feel too well either...

640
01:29:43,083 --> 01:29:44,118
What is?

641
01:30:35,035 --> 01:30:36,987
Doctor, I'm the one
with the other lady.

642
01:30:37,118 --> 01:30:38,539
How much long I have to wait?

643
01:30:38,739 --> 01:30:40,340
- The other?
- Edna, yes.

644
01:30:40,541 --> 01:30:43,077
The other lady isn't in labor,
not for the moment.

645
01:30:43,277 --> 01:30:44,912
Why not?
She has pains!

646
01:30:45,112 --> 01:30:47,381
Maybe, sympathy...

647
01:30:49,083 --> 01:30:50,517
What do you mean "sympathy"?

648
01:30:50,718 --> 01:30:52,953
They could be sympathy
pains, it happens.

649
01:30:53,084 --> 01:30:55,589
You saw a friend and
consequently... you understand.

650
01:30:57,157 --> 01:30:58,459
What should I do?
Take her home?

651
01:30:58,659 --> 01:31:01,144
No, it's that I want to
be certain that's sympathy.

652
01:31:01,145 --> 01:31:03,630
Otherwise it could be
at the most serious...

653
01:31:08,535 --> 01:31:10,037
Nicola, you know
how I'm going to call him?

654
01:31:10,237 --> 01:31:12,973
Father's name: Bonnano!

655
01:31:13,874 --> 01:31:15,909
No wait! I thought it first!

656
01:31:16,110 --> 01:31:17,211
Mine's already born.

657
01:31:17,444 --> 01:31:18,412
Mine will be here in a few days.

658
01:31:18,645 --> 01:31:21,081
- You can take grandfather's name.
- I prefer father's.

659
01:31:22,816 --> 01:31:23,851
We draw for it.

660
01:31:25,753 --> 01:31:28,555
Oh, Nicky, I'm so stupid.

661
01:31:29,123 --> 01:31:30,991
What people will think of me?

662
01:31:34,228 --> 01:31:37,731
They're maybe just sympathy pains
but they really hurt!

663
01:31:39,700 --> 01:31:42,603
My Edna, always the actress.

664
01:31:48,776 --> 01:31:50,210
I hurt so bad.

665
01:31:51,979 --> 01:31:53,047
How bad?

666
01:32:02,756 --> 01:32:03,857
Where's Mabel?

667
01:32:04,191 --> 01:32:06,126
Your friend is in next room.

668
01:32:06,227 --> 01:32:08,262
Her bed is right to the
other side of the wall.

669
01:32:13,901 --> 01:32:15,102
Any news?

670
01:32:15,636 --> 01:32:17,738
- No, nothing yet!
- So, come on.

671
01:32:17,739 --> 01:32:19,840
Get to Mabel's room.
Let's celebrate!

672
01:32:22,242 --> 01:32:23,977
No, later I will.

673
01:32:24,278 --> 01:32:26,780
I'm going to get a breath of fresh air.

674
01:32:27,047 --> 01:32:29,249
You're settled but not me.

675
01:32:30,484 --> 01:32:32,619
Tomorrow, it's Edna's turn.

676
01:33:01,648 --> 01:33:03,984
Bonnano Bonani.

677
01:34:35,642 --> 01:34:37,111
I'm dying!

678
01:35:02,403 --> 01:35:04,271
What a pretty picture!

679
01:35:42,643 --> 01:35:44,812
What have you done?

680
01:35:56,790 --> 01:35:58,692
Don't touch me!

681
01:36:12,039 --> 01:36:14,108
And what is this to me?

682
01:36:17,644 --> 01:36:19,480
He's your son, Nicola.

683
01:36:36,196 --> 01:36:37,831
Don't worry about him.

684
01:36:38,031 --> 01:36:40,801
Mabel will just have
two sons instead of one.

685
01:36:42,936 --> 01:36:45,072
She will nurse yours too.

686
01:36:46,273 --> 01:36:48,776
She'll take care of you as she does me.

687
01:36:50,477 --> 01:36:53,147
You really think you're
something, don't you?

688
01:37:18,072 --> 01:37:20,641
Don't! I'm leaving!

689
01:37:23,143 --> 01:37:24,044
Just sorrow.

690
01:37:24,645 --> 01:37:25,579
I know.

691
01:37:26,647 --> 01:37:28,215
I don't want to take it
away from you.

692
01:37:31,618 --> 01:37:33,187
You're the lucky one.

693
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:39,226
I don't want to end up
being jealous of you.

694
01:37:41,862 --> 01:37:43,263
It's not my fault.

695
01:37:44,231 --> 01:37:46,800
But you are luckier.
It's true, yes?

696
01:37:48,469 --> 01:37:50,671
What are you talking about?

697
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:54,475
Not behaving like a brother.

698
01:38:02,015 --> 01:38:03,517
What does "brother" mean?

699
01:38:09,957 --> 01:38:11,225
I don't know.

700
01:38:16,964 --> 01:38:19,400
Let us take care of you
and your son!

701
01:38:24,638 --> 01:38:26,440
I'm not leaving him with you!

702
01:38:30,310 --> 01:38:31,145
Why not?

703
01:38:31,912 --> 01:38:33,614
Not on your life!

704
01:38:48,162 --> 01:38:50,230
We're not equal any more.

705
01:38:59,273 --> 01:39:01,942
- Let's go and get him.
- Are you out of your mind?

706
01:39:02,376 --> 01:39:03,777
My wife is nursing him.

707
01:39:06,547 --> 01:39:08,348
We're not equal any more.

708
01:39:16,156 --> 01:39:19,760
Go by yourself!
I don't want to see you ever again.

709
01:39:21,962 --> 01:39:23,997
You don't? Imagine me!

710
01:39:42,716 --> 01:39:45,519
Well, when does he plan
to go back to work?

711
01:39:45,719 --> 01:39:49,156
I don't know, he tries.

712
01:39:49,356 --> 01:39:51,191
He draws and draws.

713
01:39:51,458 --> 01:39:56,096
He's unhappy.
He tears it all up.

714
01:39:58,298 --> 01:40:00,634
I try to help.

715
01:40:04,805 --> 01:40:06,840
And his brother Nicola?

716
01:40:07,408 --> 01:40:10,044
He's entrusted the baby
to Marga, our old friend.

717
01:40:11,078 --> 01:40:12,813
He's sailing for Italy today.

718
01:40:13,113 --> 01:40:15,983
He's decided to join the army.
To go fight.

719
01:41:49,710 --> 01:41:52,012
Let's go! Stand up!

720
01:42:03,924 --> 01:42:07,795
Lieutenant!
The cameraman is dead!

721
01:42:09,630 --> 01:42:11,381
Where's the soldier
who was in America?

722
01:42:11,382 --> 01:42:13,133
- What was the name? Hollywood?
- Hollywood!

723
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:24,912
Is it you, Hollywood?
Do you know how it operates?

724
01:42:28,449 --> 01:42:31,952
It was not my job
but I'll try.

725
01:42:48,268 --> 01:42:52,339
A FEW MONTHS LATER

726
01:43:08,088 --> 01:43:09,223
Slow down!

727
01:43:13,394 --> 01:43:17,297
My lieutenant excuse me,
where's Tuscany’s battalion?

728
01:43:18,198 --> 01:43:21,835
Farther up,
near the Basilica.

729
01:43:23,437 --> 01:43:24,338
That's what I think...

730
01:43:25,806 --> 01:43:27,074
Who are there?

731
01:43:27,274 --> 01:43:30,010
Americans.
They fight with us.

732
01:43:45,526 --> 01:43:48,495
You're Italian, do you
know what is this church?

733
01:43:56,804 --> 01:43:59,106
I don't know how it's called.
I'm not from around here.

734
01:44:06,513 --> 01:44:08,182
It's a beautiful Romanesque.

735
01:45:54,621 --> 01:45:55,789
Lieutenant!

736
01:46:15,309 --> 01:46:16,710
Nicola, attention!

737
01:47:06,660 --> 01:47:10,297
You know what I regret
most in having to dye, Andrea?

738
01:47:10,497 --> 01:47:13,701
Our children will never see our faces.

739
01:47:34,988 --> 01:47:37,558
I know what you're thinking of
and I'm in accord.

740
01:47:39,426 --> 01:47:42,863
When they'll be passing by here
again, they're going to reclaim this.

741
01:47:43,764 --> 01:47:47,134
And so our children will
learn how we looked like.

742
01:48:08,022 --> 01:48:10,457
Clean your face, Nicola.

743
01:48:10,657 --> 01:48:12,893
Do you want your son
see you like that?

744
01:48:27,841 --> 01:48:29,076
And now...

745
01:48:29,977 --> 01:48:31,812
make an effort to smile.

746
01:48:37,418 --> 01:48:39,153
I smile at you.
