Leng Feng Male Rank
Sergeant Role Sniper.

3
00:00:58,893 --> 00:01:00,933
Because of his unauthorized
action during a mission,

4
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:02,229
the person above shall be given
a penalty of confinement,

5
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:04,076
in accordance with discipline regulations.

6
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,665
7th August 2008.

7
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,918
According to a tip-off,
a criminal gang

8
00:01:24,085 --> 00:01:25,086
near the southern border

9
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:25,586
is running a massive operation

10
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,353
smuggling drugs inside carriers' bodies.

11
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:28,547
Their means are cruel

12
00:01:28,714 --> 00:01:29,757
and this is badly effecting the population.

13
00:01:29,924 --> 00:01:31,764
The authorities decided
to sent a special force

14
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:32,927
to co-operate

15
00:01:33,094 --> 00:01:34,374
with the local anti-drug police.

16
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,388
In tracking down the criminal gang.

17
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,370
Operational preparations complete.

18
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,123
Ready to attack.

19
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,773
Action.

20
00:03:06,395 --> 00:03:07,563
Attack with frontal assault.

21
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:41,513
Brother. Help me, brother.

22
00:03:42,348 --> 00:03:43,557
Help me.

23
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,227
You are surrounded.

24
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,394
All people in the building,

25
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,229
drop your weapons now.

26
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,146
Don't shoot. Don't shoot.

27
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,231
Don't shoot. I'm coming out now.

28
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,397
I'm coming out.

29
00:03:51,857 --> 00:03:52,937
It's nothing to do with me.

30
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,109
Don't shoot.

31
00:03:54,276 --> 00:03:55,819
Ar!

32
00:03:56,237 --> 00:03:57,446
Get me a car!

33
00:03:57,738 --> 00:03:59,114
I want a car now!

34
00:03:59,406 --> 00:04:00,991
Back off!

35
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,954
This building was built in the 60s.

36
00:04:05,704 --> 00:04:07,304
It was used to keep hazardous materials.

37
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,126
The whole building has
been specially reinforced.

38
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:12,836
The walls are made of ferroconcrete.

39
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:14,338
Its Mohs hardness scale is 8.

40
00:04:14,505 --> 00:04:16,757
The weapons of ours
cannot penetrate it.

41
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:17,924
It would be a massacre

42
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,635
if we use heavy calibre
anti-materiel weapons

43
00:04:19,802 --> 00:04:21,202
in an urban anti-terrorist mission,

44
00:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,806
so we didn't carry.

45
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,308
Cease fire.

46
00:04:26,475 --> 00:04:27,518
Everyone stop attacking.

47
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:29,103
Go back!

48
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,939
Why did you shoot without authorization?

49
00:04:32,147 --> 00:04:34,400
Sir, comrades were down.

50
00:04:34,566 --> 00:04:35,609
Cannot wait.

51
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,653
Your request is negotiable.

52
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:39,655
First, release the hostage.

53
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,542
You are trying to win
more time, aren't you?

54
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:44,159
I want a car.

55
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,301
If it happens again,

56
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:02,344
will you do the same?

57
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:06,889
What was that?

58
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,434
Who did that?

59
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,600
Who?

60
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:12,646
Sniper, Don't shoot
without order.

61
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:14,148
Don't shoot without order.

62
00:05:14,315 --> 00:05:15,649
I can shoot his head, right now.

63
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,096
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

64
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,485
What was your feeling?

65
00:05:20,612 --> 00:05:22,197
I'm the hostage.

66
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:24,908
Why did you fucking shoot me again?

67
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:27,618
Accident, accident.

68
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:28,495
It was really an accident.

69
00:05:28,662 --> 00:05:30,497
I can shoot his fucking head right now!

70
00:05:32,916 --> 00:05:34,168
Calm down.

71
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:50,976
Leng Feng, wait for
your confinement!

72
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:53,187
I wasn't thinking about killing people,

73
00:05:53,354 --> 00:05:54,772
but saving people,

74
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,482
saving my comrades.

75
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,317
It felt good.

76
00:05:58,525 --> 00:05:59,818
Were you feeling good?

77
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,031
Yes.

78
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:06,617
Killing enemies in
battle is my duty.

79
00:06:06,784 --> 00:06:08,160
How confident were you with your shooting?

80
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:09,661
50%.

81
00:06:09,828 --> 00:06:11,288
What about the other 50%?

82
00:06:13,624 --> 00:06:16,001
There was no other 50% in my case.

83
00:06:16,168 --> 00:06:17,378
I won.

84
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:18,711
OK.

85
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,380
You can go back now.

86
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:21,340
Excuse me, Sir!

87
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:22,216
Yes.

88
00:06:22,383 --> 00:06:23,675
Am I going back to my old troop?

89
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:25,427
What old troop?

90
00:06:25,594 --> 00:06:26,637
Confinement room.

91
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:34,395
"Somewhere Southeast Asia."

92
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,032
Min Deng,

93
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,200
you are under arrest.

94
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,495
For drug trafficking, human trafficking

95
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,748
weapon smuggling and aiding
terrorist activities.

96
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:57,084
You have the right to remain silent.

97
00:06:57,418 --> 00:06:58,418
Anything you say

98
00:06:58,419 --> 00:07:01,255
can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

99
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:50,257
Brother,

100
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,384
Finally, I did something big for you.

101
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:53,594
Come back. Now!

102
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,428
Brother, come on.

103
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:56,638
I was always so sure that I can help you.

104
00:09:56,805 --> 00:09:57,805
Wu Ji, run!

105
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,601
You may have already been surrounded
by the Chinese Police.

106
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,268
Brother,

107
00:10:02,561 --> 00:10:03,561
don't try to scare me.

108
00:10:03,604 --> 00:10:04,938
What Chinese Police?

109
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,272
Police!

110
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:06,982
Where?

111
00:10:07,149 --> 00:10:08,149
Police!

112
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:09,443
Police is here!

113
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,487
Brother, help me! Brother!

114
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:13,529
Help me.

115
00:10:14,698 --> 00:10:15,782
Who did the shooting?

116
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,034
I'm the hostage.

117
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Who did the shooting?

118
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,078
How could you shoot at the hostage?

119
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,295
My brother was just a child
could never grew up.

120
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,340
So eager to prove himself

121
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,345
so he rashly ran into China,

122
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:40,349
trying to prove himself to me.

123
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,309
He never thought

124
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,647
that he would die in China.

125
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,988
A Chinese guy?

126
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:57,366
Don't look down upon China.

127
00:10:58,659 --> 00:11:00,577
When you meet them,

128
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,455
you will know what you are up against.

129
00:11:03,705 --> 00:11:04,705
China.

130
00:11:05,499 --> 00:11:07,793
That is the red zone of you mercenaries.

131
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:09,836
When they meet me,

132
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:13,423
they will know what they are up against.

133
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:39,658
Some people think.

134
00:11:39,825 --> 00:11:40,951
A soldier could never disobeys his order,

135
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,452
other wise he should take off his uniform

136
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:43,787
and go home.

137
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:45,539
Some others think

138
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,541
that you should be promoted exceptionally

139
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,292
and make you an elite in the army.

140
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:53,713
I think

141
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:56,049
you have 50% chance

142
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:57,551
to be kick out of the army,

143
00:11:57,718 --> 00:11:59,469
I think I have 50% chance

144
00:11:59,636 --> 00:12:00,637
to stay in the army.

145
00:12:01,138 --> 00:12:03,098
There is no other 50% in my case.

146
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:12,274
Ever heard of wolf warrior detachment.

147
00:12:18,155 --> 00:12:19,155
Yes.

148
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:23,201
It is the blue force in the
Special Forces of PLA.

149
00:12:24,453 --> 00:12:25,453
And?

150
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:26,746
Walf warrior detachment

151
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,499
is formed by the elite of
the PLA Special Forces.

152
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,350
They are equipped with the best weapons,

153
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,253
simulate tactics of foreign special forces

154
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,505
and constantly challenge our elite troops.

155
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:37,799
They do whatever they
can to smash them

156
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:39,092
and temper them.

157
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:41,261
They are the special
force in special forces.

158
00:12:50,312 --> 00:12:51,312
Report!

159
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,086
Drinking is not allowed in the army.

160
00:12:53,523 --> 00:12:55,163
Do you think you are still a soldier now?

161
00:12:56,193 --> 00:12:57,486
Am I if I drink?

162
00:12:57,861 --> 00:12:58,861
Maybe.

163
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:00,322
May I ask who you are?

164
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:01,782
I'm Long Xiaoyun,

165
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:04,005
the current commander of Warwolf Company.

166
00:13:19,966 --> 00:13:20,967
Why choose the army?

167
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,469
Choosing the army, I have
regretted for two years,

168
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,396
but I would regret my
whole life if I didn't.

169
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,307
Truth?

170
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:30,434
Truth!

171
00:13:31,186 --> 00:13:32,186
Drink more.

172
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,407
More.

173
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,205
Are you trying to make me drunk
and tell you the truth?

174
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:51,998
Will you tell the truth?

175
00:13:52,999 --> 00:13:53,999
Yes.

176
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,292
Good.

177
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:00,382
What do you want to know?

178
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:10,392
I want to know what you will be like
when you get drunk.

179
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,603
I've never been drunk.

180
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:15,210
I started drinking when I was three.

181
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:18,567
At 5,made two boys six years older
than me drunk before I do.

182
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:20,694
At 12, I peeped at girls in showers

183
00:14:21,236 --> 00:14:22,320
with some Dutch courage.

184
00:14:22,487 --> 00:14:23,697
At 17,

185
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:29,035
What happened when you were 17?

186
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,668
Has your father disciplined you?

187
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,381
Before I was born,

188
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:45,093
my father left our current home.

189
00:14:45,343 --> 00:14:47,304
My mum wanted a baby,

190
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:51,433
so she invited my father
over for a drink.

191
00:14:51,641 --> 00:14:54,728
Dad got drunk, and here I am.

192
00:14:55,186 --> 00:14:56,605
Stop laughing.

193
00:14:58,315 --> 00:15:00,235
Leng Feng, How could you
fight with others again?

194
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:39,647
Platoon Commander,

195
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:40,941
take the intelligence and go.

196
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:42,859
Don't come over any more.

197
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:45,986
Platoon Commander,

198
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:48,782
send the intelligence back!

199
00:15:50,909 --> 00:15:52,035
Platoon Commander.

200
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,042
Do your brother a favour.

201
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:01,127
Make it quick.

202
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:03,588
Shoot me.

203
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:56,641
That is a tough one.

204
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:58,018
Everyone in Wolf detachment is tough.

205
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,728
We don't want weak ones.

206
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:07,943
Well.

207
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:09,154
See you tomorrow.

208
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,697
See you, Sir.

209
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:36,556
Ar!

210
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:34,506
My name is Shao Bing,

211
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,472
the Deputy Commander of
Wolf Warrior detahment.

212
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,386
My honor to see you, sir.

213
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,183
I don't like you.

214
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,186
Do you know why we are called Wolf warrior?

215
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:47,519
Wolves

216
00:19:48,146 --> 00:19:49,230
are social animals.

217
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,357
One wolf

218
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,235
cannot defeat a lion or a tiger,

219
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,029
but a wolf pack

220
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,031
can be invincible.

221
00:19:58,865 --> 00:19:59,865
We need teamwork

222
00:20:00,617 --> 00:20:02,160
not lone wolf.

223
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,142
Or showing off individual abilities.

224
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,370
Yes, sir.

225
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,025
Speaking of individual abilities,

226
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:08,708
my commander told me

227
00:20:09,209 --> 00:20:11,502
that she found a marvelous sniper,

228
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:14,923
but I really can't see

229
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:16,591
what so marvelous about you.

230
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,134
What have you seen?

231
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:19,626
If we were on the battlefield,

232
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:21,721
you would have been surrounded.

233
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,891
If you don't have such alertness,

234
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,605
how can you be a sniper?

235
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:32,815
If this is the real battlefield,

236
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,944
what would be your last words?

237
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:37,653
Sir!

238
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:38,696
That won't happened to me.

239
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:40,572
Why?

240
00:20:42,242 --> 00:20:43,962
Here is a barrier-free open isolation zone,

241
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:45,787
with armoured cars and tanks.

242
00:20:45,954 --> 00:20:46,954
With such a defence,

243
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,581
if dozens of special
soldiers from the enemy

244
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:50,250
could have successfully dug trenches
and conceal themselves,

245
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:51,459
and I just landed

246
00:20:51,626 --> 00:20:53,461
in the middle of the enemy's ambush trap,

247
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,076
there could only be one reason,

248
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:57,924
which is you have committed treason
with all your men.

249
00:20:58,216 --> 00:20:59,384
To traitors,

250
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,512
we usually damn all their ancestors.

251
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,473
This is a tough one,

252
00:21:06,182 --> 00:21:07,767
like our style.

253
00:21:11,271 --> 00:21:12,522
So close to his face,

254
00:21:12,772 --> 00:21:14,983
they either begin to
flight or begin to kiss.

255
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:19,904
What do you want to say, sir?

256
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,199
Yu Fei.

257
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:24,366
Yes, sir.

258
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,493
He is all yours now.

259
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:27,452
Yes, Sir.

260
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:31,624
I'm your Squad Commander.

261
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:32,791
My name is Yu Fei.

262
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:34,210
Hello, Commander.

263
00:21:35,169 --> 00:21:36,713
I like you.

264
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:39,299
Welcome to Wolves.

265
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:40,799
How is this?

266
00:21:40,925 --> 00:21:42,468
The welcome ceremony into Wolves.

267
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:43,969
Is awesome, isn't it?

268
00:21:44,345 --> 00:21:45,471
Do you know why?

269
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:47,806
Why?

270
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,976
We are the fucking best.

271
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:51,519
Tell this new guy

272
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,479
what the motto of our detachment is.

273
00:21:53,646 --> 00:21:55,148
Be humble!

274
00:21:57,984 --> 00:21:59,485
I really didn't see.

275
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,264
How is everything going now?

276
00:22:28,431 --> 00:22:29,640
All goes well.

277
00:22:29,891 --> 00:22:30,891
Shi,

278
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:32,685
you gave up your operation room

279
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,687
to that girl, Long Xiaoyun

280
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:37,899
and running around with us in the van.

281
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,192
Shi,

282
00:22:39,609 --> 00:22:40,818
you have been working hard.

283
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,446
Four old fellows

284
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:45,365
have been knocked out by her raid.

285
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,700
I don't want to be the fifth.

286
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,371
I need to make my headquarters mobile.

287
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,373
I want to see

288
00:22:53,581 --> 00:22:54,957
that there is no Achilles heel,

289
00:22:55,124 --> 00:22:57,043
how Long Xiaoyun can make her deadly blow.

290
00:23:03,841 --> 00:23:06,552
Leng Feng, tell us your
three-shoots story.

291
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:12,767
Be careful with your words.

292
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:14,934
Shit Rubberneck,
you just can't leave things alone.

293
00:23:15,269 --> 00:23:18,231
I'm Shi Rubberneck, not Shit Rubberneck.

294
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,734
That idiot, on the
very first day he came.

295
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,403
Questioned in front of everyone.

296
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,071
"Why is such a tough troop"

297
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:27,240
"led by a broad?"

298
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:28,991
He had been tricked for more than 17 times,

299
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:29,951
then he behaved.

300
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:31,198
Be careful with your words.

301
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,412
Commander Long is a woman.

302
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:33,788
A woman is a broad.

303
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:35,289
Am I wrong?

304
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:36,621
What's the big deal being?

305
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,292
Can't a woman be a commander?

306
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:39,918
In my opinion,

307
00:23:40,086 --> 00:23:41,926
there will be no wolves
without Commander Long,

308
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:42,797
right?

309
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:43,964
Yes,

310
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,258
Rubberneck is right.

311
00:23:45,425 --> 00:23:46,425
Eh?

312
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:49,020
You should have already
been taught a lesson.

313
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:52,056
In my opinion,

314
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,383
what this kind of woman needs

315
00:23:53,683 --> 00:23:55,351
is to be conquered by a man.

316
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:58,271
By which kind of man?

317
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:00,022
A man like me.

318
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:01,441
How?

319
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,109
How?

320
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,445
Ah, ah!

321
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:35,475
Ma'am.

322
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:37,201
We are running into anti-aircraft fire.

323
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:44,525
Return to base!

324
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:46,444
Drop the bait.

325
00:24:53,576 --> 00:24:53,993
Parachute.

326
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,280
Opening altitude 300 metres.

327
00:24:55,328 --> 00:24:55,912
Be careful.

328
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:56,662
New man just joined in.

329
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:57,497
Run him in as soon as possible.

330
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,915
Yes, Ma'am.

331
00:24:59,624 --> 00:25:00,333
Sir!

332
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,335
Find massive air-drop
of enemy paratroopers.

333
00:25:05,338 --> 00:25:06,088
Commander,

334
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,089
this is a tactic used by large formations

335
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:09,175
during World War II.

336
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:11,177
They are obviously bait.

337
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,806
If there are high-explosive bombs

338
00:25:15,973 --> 00:25:17,225
and drop on our position,

339
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,101
we will have serious casualties.

340
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:45,002
If we fire back,

341
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:47,755
our anti-aircraft fire will be exposed.

342
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:49,757
Then expose all to them.

343
00:25:52,385 --> 00:25:53,625
Command the anti-aircraft force

344
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:54,470
to fire all weapons.

345
00:25:54,845 --> 00:25:55,845
Yes, Sir.

346
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:00,851
Sir!

347
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,900
We got the command authority
of the blue force.

348
00:26:03,854 --> 00:26:05,189
Ma'am The red force
has penetrated

349
00:26:05,356 --> 00:26:06,899
our operational command system.

350
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:07,733
And?

351
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:08,568
We have lost

352
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:10,528
the command authority to the combat troops.

353
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,252
Contact the artillery regiment now.

354
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:26,794
Yes, Sir.

355
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:27,961
Wait.

356
00:26:29,255 --> 00:26:31,882
When we were trying to
penetrate the system,

357
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:32,758
and set up a temporary
virtual communication

358
00:26:32,925 --> 00:26:34,635
with the enemy,

359
00:26:35,261 --> 00:26:36,581
Long Xiaoyun used the same method

360
00:26:36,596 --> 00:26:38,639
and sent commands to the
artillery regiment.

361
00:26:39,765 --> 00:26:41,642
One of our mechanised infantry regiments

362
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,854
has been destroyed by our
own artillery regiment.

363
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:44,729
Interesting.

364
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:46,939
Yun, well done.

365
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,347
What's more interesting is that

366
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:51,527
this girl also has installed a virus

367
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,054
in our operational command system.

368
00:26:53,112 --> 00:26:54,947
If we made the call just now,

369
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,239
we would be bombed

370
00:26:56,324 --> 00:26:58,242
within three minutes.

371
00:26:58,409 --> 00:26:59,952
The game has just begun.

372
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:10,629
Shi,

373
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:13,299
you can directly command
the blue force now.

374
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:17,595
Copy the operation mode of
foreign special forces.

375
00:27:17,928 --> 00:27:18,929
I have been studying how to deal
with foreign forces

376
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:21,057
for the last twenty years.

377
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:31,442
Ma'am.

378
00:27:31,609 --> 00:27:32,943
Find a military unit the
same size as a regiment.

379
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:33,527
Ma'am.

380
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:36,014
Find another two military units
the same size as regiments.

381
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:39,575
Fake.

382
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:40,742
Ma'am.

383
00:27:40,785 --> 00:27:42,828
We lost contact with the Deputy Commander.

384
00:28:17,738 --> 00:28:18,738
Commander Long,

385
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,064
please reply if you hear this.

386
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:21,274
Please reply if you hear this.

387
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,038
It looks really fake.

388
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,874
They want us to think this is a fake one,

389
00:28:29,625 --> 00:28:30,876
so they left the real one here.

390
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:32,503
Let's check it out.

391
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,003
Attention, all units.

392
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:36,382
Move fast.

393
00:28:36,549 --> 00:28:37,216
When your missions is done,

394
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,217
muster at the assigned place.

395
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:38,884
Yes, Sir.

396
00:28:39,051 --> 00:28:40,051
Wait.

397
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,722
What if they want us to think

398
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:45,057
they would put the real
one in the fake one?

399
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,936
Are you doubting Commander Long's order?

400
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:51,564
I know the red force's commander.

401
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,358
I think it's probably a trap.

402
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,736
Follow the orders.

403
00:28:57,737 --> 00:28:58,737
Eh,

404
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:01,741
if this is a fake one,

405
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:04,034
The wolf will be lost.

406
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,747
The wolf never loses.

407
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:12,126
I had just begun to like you,

408
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,004
but now I'm really disappointed with you.

409
00:29:15,671 --> 00:29:16,881
Follow the orders,

410
00:29:17,590 --> 00:29:18,590
soldier.

411
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:23,641
Leng Feng has just come
over from the red force.

412
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:24,930
He must be more familiar
with the way they fight

413
00:29:25,097 --> 00:29:26,599
than us.

414
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,727
Shall I take Leng Feng and Rubberneck

415
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:31,437
and support from the perimeter?

416
00:29:31,854 --> 00:29:32,854
Eh.

417
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:34,774
When the exercise finishes,

418
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,485
you better leave the Wolf.

419
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:03,344
We are so over.

420
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:05,137
I told you it's fake.

421
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:07,848
Armoured cars, tanks.

422
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,475
Dozens of soldiers from our special force

423
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:10,100
have successfully sneaked

424
00:30:10,267 --> 00:30:12,228
into the centre of enemy's ambush trap.

425
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:13,312
Commander Shao,

426
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:16,106
you are taking your men to die
for our country together.

427
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,921
He is good.

428
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:40,506
Make him one of us.

429
00:30:40,673 --> 00:30:42,508
He is the Deputy Commander of
Wolf warrior detachment.

430
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,176
You must get him for me.

431
00:30:44,677 --> 00:30:45,553
Withdraw the exploring birds.

432
00:30:45,719 --> 00:30:46,387
Yes, Sir.

433
00:30:46,554 --> 00:30:48,305
We won't be a thing to them

434
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,474
even if we rush down now.

435
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,737
It seems like the wolf will lose this time.

436
00:31:21,380 --> 00:31:22,548
Shit.

437
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:25,009
Is this a fake one too?

438
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:28,304
Let's check it out.

439
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:44,612
Three, two, one.

440
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:45,821
Arrive.

441
00:31:51,327 --> 00:31:52,327
All gone.

442
00:32:12,056 --> 00:32:13,098
Keep watching.

443
00:32:22,232 --> 00:32:23,233
Brigade Commander,

444
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:25,110
Hello, Sir.

445
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:34,702
Brigade Commander.

446
00:32:34,828 --> 00:32:36,080
Don't ask me.

447
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,082
I'm already dead.

448
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:44,838
Report!

449
00:32:45,005 --> 00:32:46,131
The exercise umpire team has judged

450
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:47,299
that the red force's commander

451
00:32:47,466 --> 00:32:49,635
has been shot to death by our sniper.

452
00:32:50,094 --> 00:32:50,511
Li Zhijun.

453
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:51,678
Yes, sir.

454
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:52,679
Find them out.

455
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:53,430
Yes, Sir.

456
00:32:53,597 --> 00:32:54,139
Guard Company, follow me.

457
00:32:54,306 --> 00:32:55,015
Yes, Sir.

458
00:32:55,182 --> 00:32:55,808
Switch on the video.

459
00:32:55,975 --> 00:32:56,975
Cut off the line.

460
00:32:57,226 --> 00:32:58,394
I want Long Xiaoyun to see

461
00:32:58,560 --> 00:33:00,020
her men disappear one by one.

462
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:01,187
Yes, Sir.

463
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:06,944
Report!

464
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,471
The video communication with
the operating force is back on,

465
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:11,615
but cannot send instructions.

466
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:16,578
Leng Feng,

467
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,164
let me interview you.

468
00:33:19,748 --> 00:33:22,543
What did you feel when you defeated
your old commander?

469
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:26,547
Will you do the same thing to us?

470
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:29,967
The old commander said

471
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:32,553
exercises are actual combats.

472
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,846
Yo,

473
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,141
tell the truth, No one
is listening now.

474
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:38,809
We won't trick you again.

475
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:44,815
Exercises are actual combats.

476
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:46,065
Bull shit.

477
00:33:46,275 --> 00:33:48,277
Do actual combats fire empty bombs?

478
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:50,167
The reason I joined the army is to fight,

479
00:33:50,446 --> 00:33:51,446
What

480
00:33:51,488 --> 00:33:52,488
we fight over and over,

481
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:54,575
as through we are playing a game.

482
00:33:54,742 --> 00:33:56,201
Why fight?

483
00:33:56,493 --> 00:33:58,829
Nothing is better than staying
with family at home.

484
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:00,701
This is my little princess.

485
00:34:00,998 --> 00:34:01,998
Beautiful?

486
00:34:04,168 --> 00:34:05,502
Not again. Don't show my fiancme's photo

487
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,337
to others.

488
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,632
My girl is only two.

489
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:11,842
Leave her alone.

490
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:13,177
Call me dad.

491
00:34:18,766 --> 00:34:19,850
Dad.

492
00:34:21,769 --> 00:34:23,437
You little bastard.

493
00:34:30,027 --> 00:34:31,070
Commander Shao is coming.

494
00:34:38,410 --> 00:34:39,161
What's happened?

495
00:34:39,328 --> 00:34:40,996
Wolves, wolves are coming.

496
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:42,163
Where are the others?

497
00:34:42,164 --> 00:34:43,164
All dead.

498
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:55,928
Yo, it's just a few wolves.

499
00:35:27,709 --> 00:35:29,002
Call the nearest helicopter.

500
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,629
All the helicopters are controlled
by the red force.

501
00:35:30,671 --> 00:35:32,381
Our force is engaging with the red force.

502
00:35:32,548 --> 00:35:33,590
Use the public channel

503
00:35:33,757 --> 00:35:35,557
to call the red force's
commander immediately.

504
00:35:38,762 --> 00:35:40,322
Combat-ready helicopters have taken off

505
00:35:40,681 --> 00:35:42,201
and will arrive within thirty minutes.

506
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:43,392
Li Zhijun. Li Zhijun.

507
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,686
Support the wolf detachment immediately.

508
00:35:45,853 --> 00:35:47,229
They are in big trouble.

509
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:51,150
Ready to fight.

510
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:08,375
Fix bayonets.

511
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:25,118
Listen up,

512
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:27,662
We found the target.

513
00:37:27,788 --> 00:37:29,039
Yeah.

514
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:33,043
However, he is surrounded

515
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:37,172
by the entire army of the PLA.

516
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:44,554
Every Wolf warrior wants a wife,

517
00:37:45,222 --> 00:37:48,809
but we don't have enough girls.

518
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:53,146
You can get a Long Xiaoyun with discipline.

519
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:57,067
You can have a Shi Qingsong with misbehare.

520
00:38:08,161 --> 00:38:10,247
Their commander has been shot to death.

521
00:38:10,414 --> 00:38:11,614
Why are they still chasing us?

522
00:38:11,623 --> 00:38:12,749
Is it fair?

523
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:14,516
Isn't it a revenge for personal reasons?

524
00:38:14,668 --> 00:38:16,336
That's not right. I'm going to report
this to the officer.

525
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:17,583
You shot your old commander

526
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:19,172
right after you left your old troop.

527
00:38:19,339 --> 00:38:20,257
If I were your Company Commander,

528
00:38:20,424 --> 00:38:21,508
I would kill you.

529
00:38:22,259 --> 00:38:23,343
The old commander said

530
00:38:23,552 --> 00:38:25,012
exercises are actual combats.

531
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,848
Feng, you bad ass.

532
00:38:38,358 --> 00:38:39,358
Guys,

533
00:38:39,443 --> 00:38:40,443
Let's move faster.

534
00:38:41,278 --> 00:38:42,863
I feel strange.

535
00:38:43,989 --> 00:38:45,869
My old Company Commander
is really black handed.

536
00:38:59,421 --> 00:39:00,047
Watch out!

537
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:01,506
Live shell!

538
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:02,716
This is not an exercise.

539
00:39:02,924 --> 00:39:03,925
Call the headquarters.

540
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:45,759
Freeze.

541
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,959
Inform the force to be
at combat readiness.

542
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,487
Foreign force crossed the border.

543
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,910
Request for armed helicopters.

544
00:40:22,045 --> 00:40:23,085
Live shell support needed.

545
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:47,696
Fall back.

546
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:49,322
Their reinforcement is coming.

547
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,542
My little princess.

548
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,211
Beautiful?

549
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:40,600
They are back.

550
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:43,103
Mount up. Let's roll.

551
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,280
So.

552
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:55,990
How was he?

553
00:42:56,408 --> 00:42:58,285
He's as faulty as his weapon.

554
00:42:58,451 --> 00:43:00,120
Ha ha ha ha.

555
00:43:00,745 --> 00:43:01,788
That was easy.

556
00:43:01,955 --> 00:43:03,623
I'm sure their sewer will kill me

557
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:05,417
before they actually do.

558
00:43:05,750 --> 00:43:07,294
Do not underestimate them.

559
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,379
Remember, they are unarmed.

560
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,339
A simple snatch and grab, man.

561
00:43:11,715 --> 00:43:13,049
You should've just killed him.

562
00:43:13,258 --> 00:43:14,843
Now we just kicked the hornets' nest.

563
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:16,803
Exactly what I want it.

564
00:43:17,137 --> 00:43:18,930
Monkey, How is E&E looking?

565
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:20,849
Everything is good to go, man.

566
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:24,603
Report to No. 1.

567
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,146
Eagle spots the target.

568
00:43:31,192 --> 00:43:33,486
This is the territory of
the People's Republic of China.

569
00:43:33,653 --> 00:43:35,530
You are trespassing.

570
00:43:35,697 --> 00:43:37,741
I am ordering you
stop the vehicle

571
00:43:37,907 --> 00:43:39,326
and surrender immediately.

572
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:42,162
Things about to get real.

573
00:43:42,704 --> 00:43:44,331
Is this a part of your plan, too?

574
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:47,917
Gentlemen, the show
is about to begin.

575
00:43:54,841 --> 00:43:56,217
That was interesting.

576
00:43:56,676 --> 00:43:57,719
Let's go. Let's go.

577
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:44,557
You have invaded the territory

578
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:46,084
of the People's Republic of China.

579
00:44:46,226 --> 00:44:48,561
Stop the vehicle and give up resistance.

580
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:54,776
This is the territory of
the People's Republic of China.

581
00:44:54,943 --> 00:44:56,903
You are trespassing.

582
00:44:57,070 --> 00:44:57,737
I am ordering you

583
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:00,198
stop the vehicle and give up resistance.

584
00:45:00,824 --> 00:45:03,034
This is your last warning.

585
00:45:03,201 --> 00:45:04,744
Last warning.

586
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:10,250
Move.

587
00:45:10,417 --> 00:45:11,710
Let's move. Let's move.

588
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:23,096
Report! All the devices and
instruments in the helicopter

589
00:45:23,388 --> 00:45:25,181
are down, all down.

590
00:45:34,023 --> 00:45:35,984
This is a well-plotted and
targeted armed invasion

591
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:38,319
started by foreign mercenaries.

592
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:40,697
We are commanded

593
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:42,829
to stop the exercise and
turn to actual combat,

594
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:44,951
co-operating with the armed police force

595
00:45:45,118 --> 00:45:46,358
to completely block the border.

596
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:47,662
Comrade Long Xiaoyun,

597
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:49,349
you are taking a part of this mission.

598
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:50,123
Yes, Sir.

599
00:45:50,290 --> 00:45:52,330
We captured a piece of
a call from a satellite phone

600
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:54,135
proves that foreign
mercenaries have invaded.

601
00:45:54,294 --> 00:45:55,734
The mastermind behind is very likely

602
00:45:55,754 --> 00:45:57,589
to be an international
broker called Min Deng.

603
00:45:58,715 --> 00:45:59,715
Min Deng.

604
00:46:00,759 --> 00:46:01,839
He is the brother of Wu Ji,

605
00:46:01,885 --> 00:46:02,969
who was shot to death by Leng Feng.

606
00:46:03,219 --> 00:46:04,219
What's strange is

607
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:05,930
according to the signal we captured,

608
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,459
he has already crossed the border

609
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:09,309
and was not far from the border.

610
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:17,317
Where is Tomcat?

611
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:18,735
Where is he?

612
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:21,196
Tomcat is busy.

613
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,643
I was told he would be
the escort himself in this mission.

614
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:25,241
What is he doing?

615
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:28,161
Tomcat is busy getting to know

616
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:29,454
each other with the mouse.

617
00:46:30,413 --> 00:46:32,832
Tomcat, Former Seal member.

618
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:35,335
He has been in the Gulf War
and in Afghanistan twice.

619
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:36,044
After his retirement,

620
00:46:36,211 --> 00:46:37,796
he has joint in an international
mercenary organisation

621
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:39,339
and is the most expensive
one at the moment.

622
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:40,840
He never failed before.

623
00:46:41,007 --> 00:46:41,508
All his members are also retired soldiers

624
00:46:41,674 --> 00:46:43,843
from special forces of different countries.

625
00:46:49,432 --> 00:46:51,768
"Chinese Boy Scouts."

626
00:46:52,352 --> 00:46:54,604
Min Deng sent such elite mercenaries here

627
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:57,115
just because he wants
to revenge his brother,

628
00:46:57,857 --> 00:46:59,734
just because he wants a Chinese soldier.

629
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:01,528
Min Deng is a businessman.

630
00:47:01,694 --> 00:47:03,014
He came across the border himself

631
00:47:03,029 --> 00:47:04,669
and show up at the same time with Tomcat.

632
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:07,492
This is not as simple as that.

633
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:33,393
Hurry up!

634
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,644
Faster Move.

635
00:47:37,146 --> 00:47:38,146
Stretcher.

636
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,189
Move.

637
00:47:39,232 --> 00:47:41,651
Be careful More careful Report!

638
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:44,099
This is a circuit board that
the plot risked his life for.

639
00:47:49,742 --> 00:47:50,742
Graphite powder.

640
00:47:50,910 --> 00:47:51,661
They added massive amounts
of graphite powder

641
00:47:51,828 --> 00:47:53,079
into the rocket bomb.

642
00:47:53,288 --> 00:47:55,039
This kind of thing is only
a thousandth of a millimetre big.

643
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:55,790
Once the bomb explodes,

644
00:47:55,957 --> 00:47:57,083
the powder will get into
the electric instruments.

645
00:47:57,333 --> 00:47:57,876
And make them short circuit,

646
00:47:58,042 --> 00:47:59,085
even cause arc burning.

647
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:02,046
It won't be disappeared
in the air in a short time,

648
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:03,573
so aircraft cannot enter the area.

649
00:48:05,425 --> 00:48:06,759
Notify the relevant department.

650
00:48:06,926 --> 00:48:09,095
Make artificial
rain in the forest.

651
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:09,971
Use heavy rain

652
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:11,306
to wash out all the graphite powder

653
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:12,472
within one hour.

654
00:48:12,599 --> 00:48:13,099
Yes, Sir.

655
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:14,266
As we surmised,

656
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:15,852
Tomcat killed one of our soldiers.

657
00:48:16,060 --> 00:48:18,146
He should know that we are going
to block the border,

658
00:48:18,438 --> 00:48:20,273
so the only way he could escape

659
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,524
is just this one.

660
00:48:21,691 --> 00:48:23,531
This forest was a mine
field in former battles,

661
00:48:23,693 --> 00:48:25,133
and is still covered with landmines,

662
00:48:25,194 --> 00:48:26,779
unexploded ordnance and
anti-paratrooper hooks.

663
00:48:26,946 --> 00:48:28,323
To avoid casualties from our side,

664
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:30,867
I suggest that we use carpet bombing.

665
00:50:47,587 --> 00:50:48,587
Comrades,

666
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:50,339
look at the comrade who
died in front of you

667
00:50:50,506 --> 00:50:51,506
and tell me,

668
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:53,926
what is this?

669
00:50:55,053 --> 00:50:56,253
This is a letter of challenge.

670
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:58,681
The provocation to Chinese soldiers.

671
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,767
Six hours later,

672
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:02,769
the enemies will possibly cross the border

673
00:51:02,935 --> 00:51:04,145
and escape from China.

674
00:51:05,021 --> 00:51:06,397
Now, I am giving you the order

675
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,357
to take our lost honour back.

676
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,010
If you cannot complete your mission

677
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,279
within the time,

678
00:51:13,654 --> 00:51:14,781
I will call for air support

679
00:51:15,448 --> 00:51:18,201
and carpet bomb the whole area.

680
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:21,496
The place we are going to protect

681
00:51:21,954 --> 00:51:23,498
is always desolate and uninhabited.

682
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,042
If this battle had not happened,

683
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:28,503
we might never come here in our life.

684
00:51:28,961 --> 00:51:30,797
There is no pretty views here,

685
00:51:30,963 --> 00:51:32,590
and there is no treasures here,

686
00:51:33,049 --> 00:51:34,884
but in our soldiers' eyes,

687
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:36,803
here is the most beautiful place,

688
00:51:37,303 --> 00:51:40,181
because it is the border of
the People's Republic of China,

689
00:51:40,515 --> 00:51:42,683
It is the place that we must fight for

690
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:44,519
with our lives and blood.

691
00:52:03,121 --> 00:52:04,121
Now,

692
00:52:04,122 --> 00:52:06,040
let's make a vow for the
honour of our soldiers.

693
00:52:07,083 --> 00:52:08,668
Those who challenge China's resolve

694
00:52:08,876 --> 00:52:11,462
will have no safe
place to hide Salute!

695
00:52:48,875 --> 00:52:50,209
Spread into three teams,

696
00:54:01,322 --> 00:54:02,490
Alpha, hold one.

697
00:54:03,449 --> 00:54:05,076
Bravo, bound back.

698
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,700
Stop!

699
00:55:34,874 --> 00:55:35,499
Mine field.

700
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:36,666
Back off.

701
00:55:36,751 --> 00:55:37,751
Change route.

702
00:56:00,358 --> 00:56:01,776
You got eyes on the brass?

703
00:56:03,652 --> 00:56:05,905
Put him down, just wound him.

704
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:13,579
They have snipers.

705
00:56:13,746 --> 00:56:14,747
Fire suppression.

706
00:56:25,383 --> 00:56:26,050
Lie down.

707
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:27,426
One o'clock.

708
00:56:35,267 --> 00:56:36,685
The enemy is out of fire range.

709
00:56:36,852 --> 00:56:37,645
Sniper.

710
00:56:37,812 --> 00:56:39,105
Where is our sniper?

711
00:56:39,271 --> 00:56:40,439
Here.

712
00:56:49,156 --> 00:56:50,366
Come back.

713
00:56:54,829 --> 00:56:57,373
Don't come again.

714
00:56:59,583 --> 00:57:01,085
This is the order.

715
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:15,808
Commander, no! Commander.

716
00:57:17,101 --> 00:57:18,727
Company commander. No.

717
00:57:20,229 --> 00:57:22,898
Company commander, no!

718
00:57:42,418 --> 00:57:44,003
What are you doing?

719
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,297
Who told you to come over?

720
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:49,175
Haven't you heard my order?

721
00:57:49,758 --> 00:57:51,177
Stop coming.

722
00:57:52,052 --> 00:57:53,387
Have you heard me?

723
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:11,030
Brothers.

724
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:13,616
I beg you.

725
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:17,161
Do your brother a favour.

726
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:20,831
Make it quick.

727
00:58:28,672 --> 00:58:30,049
Platoon Commander.

728
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,010
Help your little brother.

729
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:35,471
Please.

730
00:58:38,849 --> 00:58:40,601
Make it quick.

731
00:58:41,435 --> 00:58:43,270
Shoot me.

732
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:54,657
Thank you.

733
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:08,879
Thank you.

734
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:39,201
Stop!

735
01:00:19,325 --> 01:00:20,492
Leng Feng,

736
01:00:21,035 --> 01:00:22,035
You.

737
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:23,787
Confine me if you can come back alive.

738
01:00:30,669 --> 01:00:31,669
How about him?

739
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:32,921
Won't die.

740
01:00:37,843 --> 01:00:39,678
Continue to outflank I will take care him.

741
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:50,480
What is he doing?

742
01:00:50,814 --> 01:00:53,108
A good sniper need 2.5 seconds at least.

743
01:00:53,651 --> 01:00:54,652
Only 2.3 seconds for me.

744
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,338
Are you sure you are going to do this?

745
01:00:56,362 --> 01:00:57,362
Report!

746
01:00:57,738 --> 01:00:58,738
Action request!

747
01:01:05,496 --> 01:01:06,496
Action!

748
01:01:08,374 --> 01:01:10,376
Change position. Move to high ground.

749
01:01:12,378 --> 01:01:13,378
Go!

750
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:28,686
Target, ten o'clock, moving fast.

751
01:01:28,852 --> 01:01:29,895
Take him!

752
01:01:31,230 --> 01:01:32,398
Take him out! Now.

753
01:01:34,483 --> 01:01:35,483
Arrived.

754
01:01:42,408 --> 01:01:43,408
Arrived.

755
01:01:52,126 --> 01:01:53,126
Arrived.

756
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,880
Leng Feng,

757
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:02,385
Leng Feng,

758
01:02:03,137 --> 01:02:04,346
Are you OK?

759
01:02:06,432 --> 01:02:07,432
Fuck.

760
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:08,600
Missed my head.

761
01:02:09,268 --> 01:02:10,728
Shot my clothes.

762
01:02:52,686 --> 01:02:53,686
Arrived.

763
01:03:05,157 --> 01:03:06,157
Arrived.

764
01:03:09,411 --> 01:03:10,411
Arrived.

765
01:03:30,891 --> 01:03:31,891
Ar.

766
01:03:32,267 --> 01:03:33,907
What do you look like when you are drunk?

767
01:03:34,686 --> 01:03:36,438
Come back alive first.

768
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:35,283
Shit!

769
01:06:56,722 --> 01:06:57,722
Go!

770
01:06:58,682 --> 01:06:59,682
Go!

771
01:07:00,225 --> 01:07:01,226
Move!

772
01:07:38,430 --> 01:07:40,599
Shit Rubberneck!

773
01:07:40,932 --> 01:07:41,975
Are you really dead?

774
01:07:42,309 --> 01:07:43,351
Wake up!

775
01:07:43,894 --> 01:07:44,894
Rubberneck!

776
01:07:52,778 --> 01:07:54,780
I will be dead if you keep shaking.

777
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:56,990
Blame your rubbish marksmanship.

778
01:07:57,574 --> 01:07:59,367
It hurts. It hurts.

779
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:00,744
Don't you feel hurt?

780
01:08:00,911 --> 01:08:02,496
I can hold.

781
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:05,665
Police sent photos of Min Deng.

782
01:08:06,124 --> 01:08:06,666
He was meeting with

783
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:09,044
the head of a bio-pharmaceutical company.

784
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:10,211
Bio-pharmaceutical?

785
01:08:10,420 --> 01:08:11,046
One month ago,

786
01:08:11,213 --> 01:08:13,133
one of our disease prevention
and control centres

787
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:14,758
was broken by commercial spies.

788
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,050
They successfully stole

789
01:08:16,093 --> 01:08:17,853
a huge number of blood
samples of volunteers,

790
01:08:18,095 --> 01:08:19,930
and genetic data of variant viruses.

791
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:21,473
If these samples and data

792
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:22,800
finished up at this so called

793
01:08:22,808 --> 01:08:24,851
international bio-pharmaceutical company,

794
01:08:25,143 --> 01:08:27,270
They would make disease with Chinese genes

795
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:30,023
that can only infect Chinese people.

796
01:08:30,816 --> 01:08:33,819
Or even increase the
malformation rate of new-borns

797
01:08:34,027 --> 01:08:35,487
by over ten thousand times.

798
01:08:35,904 --> 01:08:37,447
Genetic weapon.

799
01:09:57,319 --> 01:09:58,319
This is from Tomcat.

800
01:09:58,361 --> 01:09:59,905
The border deployment
map of China Military.

801
01:10:00,071 --> 01:10:01,911
He said the border has
been completely blocked,

802
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:03,366
and let us think of a way out ourselves

803
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:04,910
to do what we really want to do.

804
01:10:32,646 --> 01:10:34,481
This is the MD-82-B Antipersonnel Mine.

805
01:10:34,648 --> 01:10:35,648
Burst direction 180,

806
01:10:35,690 --> 01:10:36,930
explosion area 30 cubic metres,

807
01:10:36,942 --> 01:10:38,109
probability of kill 98%,

808
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:39,903
with 100 steel shots inside the mine.

809
01:10:40,070 --> 01:10:41,446
Successful manual disarming
rate is very low.

810
01:10:41,613 --> 01:10:42,614
The changing pressure

811
01:10:42,781 --> 01:10:45,700
cannot exceed 0.5 kilograms if....
Quiet!

812
01:10:51,164 --> 01:10:52,164
Leng Feng,

813
01:10:53,124 --> 01:10:54,124
Listen to me.

814
01:10:55,293 --> 01:10:56,294
Be careful.

815
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:58,797
You must be very careful.

816
01:11:00,632 --> 01:11:02,342
I'll wait for you back to buy me a drink.

817
01:11:45,343 --> 01:11:47,095
Leng Feng, Leng Feng.

818
01:11:56,813 --> 01:11:57,939
Leng Feng.

819
01:11:59,065 --> 01:12:00,065
Answer me.

820
01:12:00,233 --> 01:12:02,110
Leng Feng, are you OK?

821
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:04,279
Leng Feng, Leng Feng.

822
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:07,824
Yeah.

823
01:12:08,908 --> 01:12:10,702
Yeah.

824
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:15,457
That's hurt.

825
01:12:17,125 --> 01:12:18,543
Long Xiaoyun,

826
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:21,087
do you have a boyfriend?

827
01:12:27,093 --> 01:12:29,471
He is asking you if you have a boyfriend.

828
01:12:44,944 --> 01:12:46,237
No.

829
01:12:48,031 --> 01:12:49,157
What?

830
01:12:49,824 --> 01:12:51,117
What, what?

831
01:12:51,993 --> 01:12:53,244
She said she doesn't have one.

832
01:13:07,759 --> 01:13:08,760
Shit Rubberneck!

833
01:13:09,886 --> 01:13:12,097
I would have long killed
that big guy without you.

834
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:13,890
I'm Shi Rubberneck,

835
01:13:15,016 --> 01:13:16,267
Not Shit Rubberneck.

836
01:13:16,601 --> 01:13:17,601
Ar.

837
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:18,936
Comrade,

838
01:13:19,896 --> 01:13:22,107
you have to find Leng Feng.

839
01:13:23,066 --> 01:13:24,192
Don't worry.

840
01:13:25,652 --> 01:13:27,237
I will find him.

841
01:14:01,312 --> 01:14:02,312
Freeze.

842
01:16:11,609 --> 01:16:12,986
Are you kicking legs with me?

843
01:16:24,247 --> 01:16:25,456
You know I'll go admit

844
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,710
you may not be the smartest soldier
I have ever seen, but

845
01:16:28,876 --> 01:16:30,378
you are the bravest.

846
01:16:31,379 --> 01:16:32,859
Can you son of a bitch speak Chinese?

847
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:33,840
What?

848
01:16:34,007 --> 01:16:35,007
Fuck!

849
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:50,982
You call yourself the mercenary red zone.

850
01:16:52,400 --> 01:16:54,611
You are not but a bunch of boy scouts.

851
01:16:54,861 --> 01:16:55,945
Listen,

852
01:16:56,613 --> 01:16:59,157
don't even think of going back
when you break into China.

853
01:17:34,400 --> 01:17:35,693
Look at you.

854
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:38,905
You are willing to die for your country,

855
01:17:41,324 --> 01:17:43,368
but I got news for you, bucko.

856
01:17:43,826 --> 01:17:45,328
Doesn't make a difference.

857
01:17:49,999 --> 01:17:51,542
Doesn't make a difference.

858
01:17:54,045 --> 01:17:55,880
Wanna know what I fight for?

859
01:17:58,383 --> 01:17:59,384
Money.

860
01:18:09,268 --> 01:18:10,520
You are fucking...

861
01:18:22,573 --> 01:18:24,617
You want to die for your country.

862
01:19:10,163 --> 01:19:11,330
Leng Feng,

863
01:19:16,544 --> 01:19:17,962
Hold on.

864
01:20:24,403 --> 01:20:31,202
Kill!

865
01:20:35,456 --> 01:20:37,124
Kill!

866
01:20:44,048 --> 01:20:45,049
Come.

867
01:20:47,552 --> 01:20:48,845
Now what.

868
01:20:54,225 --> 01:20:55,560
What.

869
01:22:55,513 --> 01:22:56,514
Take away.

870
01:23:08,025 --> 01:23:10,152
Every beautiful place has stories.

871
01:23:11,737 --> 01:23:13,531
Those who challenge China's resolve

872
01:23:14,949 --> 01:23:16,784
will have no safe place to hide.

873
01:23:35,761 --> 01:23:37,722
Leng Feng asked me to give you this.

874
01:23:41,142 --> 01:23:42,622
He met the same situation as you did.

875
01:23:43,394 --> 01:23:45,521
He went ahead and
saved his comrade.

876
01:23:50,067 --> 01:23:51,068
He wants me to tell you

877
01:23:51,902 --> 01:23:53,362
it is easy to get killed.

878
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:57,033
But living with

879
01:23:57,199 --> 01:23:58,839
the guilt and the responsibility is hard.

880
01:24:23,726 --> 01:24:25,269
Platoon Commander,

881
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,313
I beg you.

882
01:24:28,189 --> 01:24:29,732
Do your brother a favour.

883
01:24:31,067 --> 01:24:32,943
Make it quick.

884
01:24:36,072 --> 01:24:37,448
Thanks.

885
01:24:58,469 --> 01:24:59,720
Commander, hard work for you.

886
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:02,098
Serve the people.

887
01:25:03,557 --> 01:25:05,267
I have met your father.

888
01:25:07,311 --> 01:25:08,604
Happy?

889
01:25:14,110 --> 01:25:15,986
I'll be more handsome when I get old.

890
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:25,996
How did you clear the mine you were on?

891
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:29,333
I can't remember.

892
01:25:30,543 --> 01:25:33,462
How about you buy my some drink.

893
01:25:34,213 --> 01:25:36,173
Wait for your confinement.

894
01:25:50,187 --> 01:25:52,439
"Chinese Boy Scouts"

895
