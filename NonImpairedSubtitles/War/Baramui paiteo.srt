Aviation school?

00:06:57,550 --> 00:07:03,455
You want to go there?
What for?

50
00:07:05,057 --> 00:07:05,546
To be a pilot

51
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:10,652
Well, well You have no idea
what the world is like

52
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:12,458
It ' s no use being a pilot

53
00:07:12,565 --> 00:07:15,363
or whatever

54
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:19,871
You'll just die in the war

55
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:23,066
I don 't care about
dying or living

56
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:25,474

A VIA TION SCHOOL

61
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:45,856

62
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:08,853

00:08:27,773 --> 00:08:31,368
Hey, why do you keep beating me?
I ' m not your punching bag

END OF THE PACIFIC WAR - 1945

68
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,674
A
Stop!

69
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:38,944
That ' s how I began to dream
of being a pilot

70
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,541
But the end of the Pacific War

71
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:43,247
ended my dream
Stop!

72
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,756
You'll be dead

73
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:50,352
The end of the war
was driving people mad

74
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,661
Who are they?

75
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:13,177
They ' re Koreans who refused
to fly in the Kamikaze

76
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,974
Let them go!

77
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,549
But

78
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:18,947
Y es, sir!

79
00:10:21,554 --> 00:10:24,148
The Kamikaze is a sacred ceremony

80
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:26,554
We can 't stain it
with the blood of Koreans

81
00:10:32,164 --> 00:10:34,860
You bastards!

82
00:10:35,768 --> 00:10:38,362
You ' re just using us
as human shields

83
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:42,271
When did you teach us
how to fly?

84
00:10:49,782 --> 00:10:50,942
Shit!

85
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:55,443
Who the hell are you?

86
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,461
What insolence
you Korean!

87
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,760
How dare you defy
His Majesty's rule?

88
00:11:07,867 --> 00:11:12,361
Fine, shoot me

89
00:11:14,373 --> 00:11:22,678
Pilot? Aviation school?
I don 't give a damn anymore

90
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,448
Go ahead, you bastards!

91
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,353
Stop it

92
00:11:37,563 --> 00:11:39,258
Not bad for a greenhorn
What's that silly skill?

93
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,560
It's called Taekkyeon
a Korean martial art

94
00:11:41,667 --> 00:11:44,761
Korean martial arts?

95
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:50,365
Let me make an offer

96
00:11:50,476 --> 00:11:57,939
If you defeat me in a fight, I ' ll
let you and your friends live

97
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:03,955
But if you lose, I 'll
only kill you Gruesomely

98
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,250
What do you think?

99
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,670
It seems you care
about your life indeed

100
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,266
Baedal!

101
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,459
Are you scared?

102
00:14:22,561 --> 00:14:28,158
Showing your back in a fight
you certainly are Korean

103
00:14:28,267 --> 00:14:30,667
You don ' t have enough honor
to learn martial arts

104
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:49,948
Baedal, Baedal!
Wake up!

105
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,354
And so that year passed...

106
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:57,156
Japan surrendered unconditionally
because of the atomic bomb

107
00:14:57,263 --> 00:14:59,060
And my country was liberated

108
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:05,867
However, only devastation was left
after the war ended

109
00:15:07,573 --> 00:15:11,976
Similarly, my courage was left
in ruins after that defeat

110
00:15:15,781 --> 00:15:17,248
Give me a chocolate

111
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,047
Give me a chocolate

112
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,345
Give me a chocolate

113
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,961

Oh, hello, sir!
How are you?

135
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:26,977
I was just about to pay
my tax to you

136
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:33,743
You've already been working here
for days without permission

137
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:37,049
You want to pay your taxes now?

138
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:44,460
That machine, the ' pachinko'
or whatever, is very interesting

139
00:17:44,563 --> 00:17:48,659
Give it to me!

140
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,962
Oh please, not my machine!

141

I ' m going to kill you!

146
00:19:29,968 --> 00:19:34,166
Is that urine?

147
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:41,674

The bed-wetter of Ikebukuro!

150

You should pay with your life

151

You eat what you spilt

152
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:09,969
Then crawl between my legs saying
I 'm the bed-wetter of Ikebukuro'

153
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:16,742
If you don 't...

Baedal!

No! Don ' t!
Please don ' t, Baedal!

00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,958
You want to die?

158
00:21:14,373 --> 00:21:25,341
I, Choi Baedal
am the bed-wetter of Ikebukuro

159
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,543
Louder, you Korean!

160
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:29,746
Look at that HAHA

161
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:43,567
I, Choi Baedal
am the bed-wetter of Ikebukuro

162
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,846
Baedal

163
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:11,661
What you did was very wrong

164
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:15,358
Well, well, look who's here

165
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,866
You still have the habit of
getting into people ' s business

166
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,372
You want to lose
your other hand, too?

167
00:22:47,265 --> 00:22:49,256
Bastard!

168
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:22,752
Bumsoo

169
00:24:24,763 --> 00:24:26,253
Baedal

170
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:37,967
Bumsoo, I 'm sorry to show myself
to you like this

171
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,946
greatest circus!

172
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:55,459
Can you have ti see it

173
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,152
Man on the fly

174
00:24:57,262 --> 00:24:59,355
beautiful women on the swing

175
00:24:59,464 --> 00:25:01,557
A man walking on the rope

176
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:09,072
Here, have some soup

177
00:25:09,174 --> 00:25:14,077
Oh, kimchi Great!
It ' s been quite long

178
00:25:22,153 --> 00:25:25,748
By the way, those yakuzas
do you know them?

179
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:31,154
You cannot avoid dealing with them
when you' re the guard for a circus

180
00:25:31,263 --> 00:25:33,959
They ' re extra trouble for a troupe

181
00:25:34,065 --> 00:25:36,158
Iike ours, with lots of Koreans

182
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:41,862
Aren 't those ration tickets?
They' re as good as money

183
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:44,066
Why don 't you use them
instead of just collecting them?

184
00:25:45,677 --> 00:25:48,771
We are planning to build a school
for the Korean kids in this area

185
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:53,444
They shouldn ' t forget our language
even though they've left Korea

186
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,349
I see

187
00:25:56,354 --> 00:26:00,450
Baedal, how are your parents?

188
00:26:04,162 --> 00:26:05,356
Bumsoo!

189
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:14,063
Teach me
how to be a fighter

190
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:28,849
Bumsoo wouldn ' t give up his will

191
00:26:29,354 --> 00:26:30,651
Baedal must be very cold

192
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,053
You, poor thing!

193
00:27:08,159 --> 00:27:09,148
Baedal!

194
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,249
Bumsoo!

195
00:27:12,764 --> 00:27:18,760
Baedal, if you make a fist
you can ' t grasp anything

196
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:23,969
not friends, not earth
nor sky

197
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:30,339
But if you unclench your fist
you can hold the whole world

198
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:06,044
Baedal, practice martial arts hard
to protect yourself

199
00:28:06,151 --> 00:28:08,949
Bumsoo, why are you saying that?

200
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:10,851
You understand what I mean?

201
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:15,255
Get him!

202
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,760
Follow him!

203
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,955
Get him!

204
00:28:32,277 --> 00:28:33,471
Shoot!

205
00:28:37,449 --> 00:28:38,746
Get him!

206
00:29:02,474 --> 00:29:09,937
Little master, use your abilities
to protect yourself and others

207
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:14,150
Live fairly, and protect

208
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:18,052
the things you care about

209
00:29:19,057 --> 00:29:21,855
What ' s he doing?

210
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:26,056
I remember he said he would never
teach the martial arts as they can be
as deadly as poison

211
00:29:26,564 --> 00:29:32,867
Well, he must be different
from someone

212
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:35,066
Damn

213
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:38,574
What? How rude you are
to an old lady like me!

214
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:40,473
Bastard!

215
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,739
BOOK OF FIVE RINGS
BY MIYAMOTO MUSASHI

216
00:29:48,052 --> 00:29:53,149
Justice without power is empty but
power without justice is only
violence

217
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:59,756
A warrior always keeps
his sword sharp but he never
draws it without a cause

218
00:30:00,865 --> 00:30:06,360
Miyamoto Musashi
the best swordsman ever
will be a good teacher for you

219
00:30:12,977 --> 00:30:19,940
Pachinko!

220
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:22,246
Pachinko!

221
00:30:25,957 --> 00:30:27,151
I ' m sorry

222
00:30:27,258 --> 00:30:29,453
You stupid bastards!

223
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,857
Go away!
You bastard!

224
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,664
What ' s happening?

225
00:30:40,772 --> 00:30:45,675
Ahem, it's your fault
Don 't be rude

226
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,074
Apologize now

227
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:56,952
I ' m sorry

228
00:31:11,069 --> 00:31:14,766
Japan Karate Association

229
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,273
The bed-wetter of Ikebukuro!

230
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,574
That's what people call you
these days

231
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:26,047
Is that why you begged
for your life? To live like that?

232
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,742
You are shameless!

233
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:44,160
What made Miyamoto Musashi
different from other warriors

234
00:31:44,269 --> 00:31:48,171
as that he dreamed of being
the best fighter in the world

235
00:31:50,174 --> 00:31:53,974
The best, the strongest man
in the world!

236
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:03,947
That is what you should dream of
to be as strong as your name
Baedal, 'the Korean people'

237
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:39,045
If you practice for
a thousand days
you' re still a beginner

238
00:32:39,157 --> 00:32:43,253
But if you practice for
ten thousand days
you can become a master

239
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:45,454
This is kyokushin
or ' pure truth '

240
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:51,661
The spirit of kyokushin means to do
your best, until the last moment

241
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:02,869
Today, I ' m still walking
aimlessly

242
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:07,247
Help our lady!

243
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,650
Please help!

244
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,646
Stop it!

245
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,562
Let's go!
We shouldn 't have seen it

246
00:33:20,064 --> 00:33:21,053
- What the fuck up bitch
- Help, please help the lady!

247
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,565
Officer! help!

248
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:33,971
Those bastards are worse
than the police or yakuzas!

249
00:33:34,078 --> 00:33:36,569
Let's go, hurry!

250
00:33:36,647 --> 00:33:43,246
Please, help!
Please!

251
00:33:43,354 --> 00:33:46,551
Please, don ' t do this!

252
00:33:46,657 --> 00:33:49,148
Somebody help!

253
00:33:52,063 --> 00:33:55,055
The Japs don ' t protect
their own girls

254
00:33:55,166 --> 00:33:57,259
Why are you getting involved?
Shit!

255
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:00,863
Help
please help

256
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:06,768
Help!

257
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,971
Somebody help!

258
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:20,648
Do you speak Korean?
No?

259
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:24,159
How about Gyeongsang dialect?
Bastards

260
00:35:53,951 --> 00:35:55,441
Baedal!

261
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,650
What are you doing? Let ' s go

262
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:17,965
Baedal, Baedal

263
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:29,843
Hey, you stupid fool
Are you crazy?

264
00:36:29,954 --> 00:36:32,252
You have no idea what kind
of bastards they are

265
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:35,553
My goodness you idiot

266
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:43,163
And why are you smiling like?

267
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,758
You got a crush on her?

268
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:49,666
What?

269
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:55,872
You want me to teach you
something nice?
Catch birds at once

270
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:57,743
That girl

271
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:02,847
Oh, well, what am I doing now

272
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:06,254
What is it?

273
00:37:17,468 --> 00:37:18,662
What is it?

274
00:37:26,877 --> 00:37:28,276
It ' s getting cold

275
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:33,642
Hey, what are you waiting for?

276
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,946
Go out and work
You came here to sightsee?

277
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:37,850
Why? Too embarrassing?

278
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:42,654
You' re a rickshaw-man

279
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:47,961
what do you worry about?

280
00:37:48,065 --> 00:37:49,862
Wear a hat

281
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,867
then no one will recognize you

282
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:52,867
Hey!

283
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:54,164
What?

284
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,172
Is that what you meant
by something nice?

285
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,367
Why, you don ' t like?

286
00:37:58,409 --> 00:38:01,901
idiot it

287
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:06,948
Crazy bastard
don ' t complain Go!

288
00:38:16,060 --> 00:38:18,858
Youko! You ' ve got a crush
on him, don 't you?

289
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,362
Setsu!

290
00:38:25,169 --> 00:38:27,467
Setsu! Have you heard
of the brave tiger?

291
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:30,972
The brave tiger?
The mythical hero?

292
00:38:31,075 --> 00:38:33,373
No, I mean, recently

293
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:38,244
Ah, the man who saves girls
from American soldiers?

294
00:38:38,349 --> 00:38:41,944
That's just a story

295
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:45,853
That man who helped me
maybe he was the brave tiger?

296
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:46,945
Heck, no!

297
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:51,256
I ' m sure he was the brave tiger

298
00:38:51,362 --> 00:38:59,667
If not, how come he would risk
his life to save me?

299
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:06,073
Then you think the guy who saved
you is a hero? The brave tiger?

300
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:10,341
A hero is protecting girls
in this neighborhood?

301
00:40:28,959 --> 00:40:32,952

Don ' t worry
I won ' t tell the police

309
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:58,661
You saved me the other day

310
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:03,172
Oh, well, that is

It must ' ve been very painful

313

You seem about my age

318
00:45:02,066 --> 00:45:07,561
Baedal! Let's be friends!

319
00:45:08,772 --> 00:45:10,763

Baedal, slow down

329
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,563
Are you Ok?

330
00:46:58,949 --> 00:47:00,644
Follow me

331
00:47:39,957 --> 00:47:41,754
Long time no see, brave tiger?

332
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:47,252
I don 't understand

333
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:55,066
Don 't you know what we did
to Korean women?

334
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,766
Why are you helping
Japanese women?

335
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:01,872
Is that why you called me here?

336
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:12,354
I have been practicing karate
since I was five

337
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:15,050
and I have never been beaten
by anyone in a fight

338
00:48:16,860 --> 00:48:23,561
You ' re the first one to hit me

339
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:31,169
In that sense, I acknowledge
your fighting spirit

340
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,867
But that ' s all

341
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:41,145
Don 't ever talk of the brave tiger
or pretend to have
a noble samurai spirit!

342
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:50,157
Next time I see you
you ' ll be dead!

343
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:56,460
Have some fun here!

344
00:48:56,566 --> 00:48:58,966
It ' s pachinko!

345
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:00,358
Get out of my lane

346
00:49:00,470 --> 00:49:03,064
Pachinko!
Louder! Louder!

347
00:49:04,374 --> 00:49:05,466
Go away!

348
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:27,154
Find the rationing tickets!

349
00:49:28,765 --> 00:49:31,461
Find them! Check everywhere!

350
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:37,366
Pachinko, ah, I ' m hungry

351
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:43,544
Hey, why so glum?

352
00:49:43,947 --> 00:49:45,141
Why are you so happy?

353
00:49:45,248 --> 00:49:48,547
The yakuzas came here a while ago
so I was really worried

354
00:49:48,652 --> 00:49:52,349
But they just passed by

355
00:49:52,456 --> 00:49:55,948
They seemed to be going
somewhere else

356
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:57,253
Where?

357
00:49:57,361 --> 00:50:01,263
Over there,
near the railway that way

358
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:08,567
Where?

359
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,867
Where are the ration tickets?

360
00:50:10,974 --> 00:50:13,374
Here! Come this way!

361
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:33,760
Are the ration tickets
more important than your life?

362
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:56,484
Baedal, Baedal! Wake up!
Baedal, Baedal!

363
00:55:59,689 --> 00:56:04,888
Justice without power is empty but
power without justice is only
violence

364
00:56:05,695 --> 00:56:09,597
Be strong to protect yourself
and others

365
00:56:17,273 --> 00:56:18,763
Baedal!

366
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,775
Youko

367
00:56:22,479 --> 00:56:25,937
Justice without power is empty
but power without justice
is only violence

368
00:56:30,253 --> 00:56:32,050
Be strong to protect yourself
and others

369
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,364
Baedal!

370
00:56:55,278 --> 00:56:56,836
Take care
