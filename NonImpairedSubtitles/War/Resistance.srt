1
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,250
Tom!

2
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:35,250
Tom!

3
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,250
Tom!

4
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,250
The boys in "The Court" too?

5
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,250
The men all left Olchon.

6
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:20,250
Just the dogs.

7
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:24,850
So, what are we going to do then?

8
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,050
Wait for them to come back.

9
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:29,050
From where?

10
00:03:29,750 --> 00:03:32,050
Do we even know where they've gone?

11
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:36,050
And the sad thing is...

12
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,150
...there must be a reason.

13
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,550
So, what are you saying Maggie?

14
00:03:43,450 --> 00:03:46,550
They wouldn't be so stupid.
They're farmers!

15
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:52,550
Sarah?

16
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:57,550
Maggie's right. We should wait.

17
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:24,750
Got them all?

18
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,550
What is it, George?

19
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:39,950
My father.

20
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,550
It won't be just him.

21
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,550
You'll be doing more here, then
you ever could at the front.

22
00:04:57,550 --> 00:04:59,550
How long before they get here?

23
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,550
A week...

24
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,550
...maybe two.

25
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,550
We won't be meeting like this again.

26
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:13,550
From now on, everything goes
to the drop point.

27
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,750
(sighs)

28
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,750
This is it, George.

29
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:24,050
You're on your own now.

30
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:45,050
Did you hear Will leave?

31
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:47,250
No.

32
00:05:52,050 --> 00:05:54,050
What if they're not back today?

33
00:05:55,050 --> 00:05:57,050
Then he'll be back tomorrow.

34
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,050
Radio: "The German invasion continues
to advance north and west.

35
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:31,050
"Reinforcements are being mobilized

36

"Reports indicate Swindon, Oxford, and
Bristol are all occupied by enemy forces.

"Stand fast, and on no account,
leave your homes."

39
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,750
Jesus, George... Stop bloody creeping
around, will you?

40
00:06:51,150 --> 00:06:51,850
Sorry, Dad.

41
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,850
"And the counter offensives in Coventry,

BAM!

48
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:15,100
(Baby crying)

49
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,800
I know, Clare.

50
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,800
Mommy's coming... mommy's coming.

51
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,800
(Explosions in the distance)

52
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,800
It's coming closer.

53
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,800
If they're not back by tomorrow,
I'm going into town.

54
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:52,500
The Fisher Market. We're going then.

55
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,500
Writing: "20th of October...

"Why didn't any of you say something?

"You should have talked to me."

59
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,200
Tom?

60
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,000
You're Sarah Lewis?

61
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:07,800
Sit down.

62
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,600
My name is Capt. Wolfram.

63
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,100
We have established an observation
post in this valley...

64
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:20,100
I... ah, take it you weren't aware that
this area is under military control.

65
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,300
No.

66
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:30,100
From now on, no one is to leave
or enter this valley.

67
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,800
We'll be here for a week, perhaps two.

68
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:42,100
Is your husband at home, Mrs. Lewis?

69
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,300
No.

70
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,500
He's up on the hill.

71
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,500
One of the sheep sick.

72
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,600
I see.

73
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:02,100
If you would tell him of my visit and
instructions, I would be eternally grateful.

74
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:05,100
Evening, Mrs. Lewis.

75
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,700
(A gun cocks)

76
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,100
Is there a problem?

77
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,900
Can't give you anything.

78
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,500
"The civilian must do nothing...

79
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,900
which would be of the slightest
help to the enemy."

80
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,100
I ah... appreciate your concerns.

81
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:49,100
I would however, like to
remind you that...

82
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,100
whether your government forbids your
cooperation or not, is entirely irrelevant.

83
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,100
This valley is now under German control.

84
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,300
Now...

85
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,100
We must get on with our work.

86
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,100
Do you think it is any easier for me?

87
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,100
I've got a flock to look after. The pigs.
The slats on the barn to fix.

88
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:31,200
And you've got Bethan to help you.

89
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,100
Oh, she's inside the house.

90
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,100
I'll help you with the barn.

91
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:40,100
No, you've got enough, as it is.

92
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:42,100
Bethan isn't going anywhere.

93
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,300
I have anxieties about the man.

94
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,800
He knows...

95
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:53,800
...enough.

96
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,200
We don't even know where they are.

97
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:55,200
(Hears noise from outside)

98
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,800
(Knocking on a door)

99
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:57,800
I'm sorry.

100
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,200
It was prodded when I found him.

101
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:27,200
It was his idea to come.

102
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:30,200
My men have gone to
the other farms too.

103
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,400
I wrote notes for them to
give to the women.

104
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,200
This will make it hard for you.

105
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,200
Are you cold?

106
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:19,400
When did they leave you?

107
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,200
Your husband, and the others?

108
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,200
You can go now.

109
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,200
Mom!

110
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,700
Mrs. Jones?

111
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,700
They didn't tell you of their
plans, did they?

112
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,100
I... ah, have no interest in
bringing your husbands

113
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:30,700
absence to the attention
of my superiors.

114
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:32,700
I know what they will do.

115
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:35,700
Neither of us want the
Gestapo in this valley.

116
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:38,700
The Gestapo isn't all we
have to worry about.

117
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,700
Without the men it was much improved
to our happiness, that is.

118
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:45,700
We've come to talk to you.

119
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,100
You know what happens to
collaborators, Maggie, do you?

120
00:27:14,150 --> 00:27:15,700
They'd be helping us, Ruth.

121
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,700
What if they're waiting for the
Germans to leave?

122
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,000
We'd be asking them to stay for longer.

123
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,100
With this weather?

124
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:23,500
They're stuck here whatever.

125
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,500
You do what you have to, Maggie.

126
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,500
I don't want their help.

127
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:31,500
"December 5th...

128
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,500
"Your all I've got, Tom.

129
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:47,700
"Let me know you're still here."

130
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:13,500
(Dogs barking)

131
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,100
Bless thee, oh Lord, for these,
they gifts...

132
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,100
...for which we are about to receive.

133
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,100
And look after our loved ones...

134
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:01,100
...Wherever they may be.

135
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,100
In Christ, our Lord. Amen.

(No audible dialog)

(Gunshot)

138
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,600
(Multiple gunfire all around)

139
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:51,600
(Men screaming in agony)

140
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,600
Mrs. Lewis!

141
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:22,100
I...

142
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,100
wanted to apologize.

143
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,100
The day of the snow skirmish, I shouldn't
have asked about your husband like that.

144
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,100
It wasn't my intention to upset you.

145
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:43,100
Anyway...

146
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,100
I'm sorry.

147
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:46,600
Good day, Mrs.Lewis.

148
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:47,900
I never thanked you...

149
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,900
...for helping me.

150
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,800
You shouldn't thank me.

151
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:07,000
You should hate me, I understand this.

152
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,500
What are you doing here?

153
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,300
Delivering messages to the valley.

154
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,000
I help out sometimes.

155
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,800
There's a backlog after winter.

156
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,800
The usual postman is not here anymore.

157
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:55,800
The letters.

158
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,800
There's no one in the in that valley now.

159
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,300
I thought about what you asked.

160
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,300
No one's to go into town.

161
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,300
It would be too dangerous.

162
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,300
We're done here, then?

163
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,300
Yeah...

164
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,300
our uniforms are wearing out.

165
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,300
There was a floordrobe left
at The Court, and...

166
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:55,300
Do what you like.

167
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:57,300
They're only clothes and things.

168
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:11,300
"March, 10th...

"I'll only be 27 when this is done.

170
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,300
"And you aren't here.

171
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,300
"It's weeks now since the thaw.

172
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,300
"No one has come into the valley.

173
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:29,300
"I had to moan about bales of precious
crops I manage to leave."

174
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,300
(Knock on door)

175
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:51,300
(Dog barking wildly)

176
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,300
Good morning.

177
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,300
May I come in?

178
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,300
I wanted to bring you this.

179
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:20,300
Why?

180
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:24,300
For your birthday.

181
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:30,300
When I was here before, I read
the date in your Bible.

182
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,300
You have no music here. I thought
you might like some.

183
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:56,300
(Song Without Words, Op19 No. 6 in
G Minor, by Felix Mendelssohn)

184
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,300
What are you doing here?

185
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:15,800
You've won this war, you can just leave.

186
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,500
I read you now.

187
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,500
I know what you did.

188
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:40,500
Don't come here and cover yourself
with your music, because I see.

189
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,500
I see you.

190
00:46:07,010 --> 00:46:09,500
You really think they'll
come back if we go?

191
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:13,000
You think he's dead, don't you?

192
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,100
Maybe not.

193
00:46:23,100 --> 00:46:25,100
If Tom was dead, I'd know.

194
00:46:41,600 --> 00:46:43,100
Why did you come here?

195
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,100
To look for them?

196
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,100
No, we were looking for
something quite different.

197
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,100
Did you find it?

198
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,100
Will you let me show you?

199
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:37,100
What is it?

200
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,100
The World.

201
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,100
One idea of it.

202
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,100
It would had have more color, originally.

203
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:53,100
The rivers were blue. The seas, green.

204
00:48:54,100 --> 00:48:56,100
It must have been beautiful.

205
00:48:57,600 --> 00:48:59,300
Why is it here?

206
00:49:01,500 --> 00:49:03,100
It's been hidden.

207
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:04,100
From you?

208
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:05,300
Yes.

209
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,100
Well, at least, from the SS, Himmler.

210
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,100
Why do they want it?

211
00:49:14,100 --> 00:49:17,100
They use artifacts like this
to justify what they do.

212
00:49:24,600 --> 00:49:26,100
What are these?

213
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,100
These letters?

214
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,100
"M, O, R, S."

215
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,100
They represent "death."

216
00:49:36,100 --> 00:49:38,100
Which dwells outside God's creation.

217
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,100
How do you know all of this?

218
00:49:48,500 --> 00:49:50,100
It's what I studied before the war.

219
00:49:50,600 --> 00:49:51,600
Medieval History.

220
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,100
What if Tom came here?

221
00:49:58,100 --> 00:50:00,600
This map, what it represents...

222
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,600
...it's more important then any of us.

223
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,600
I haven't told my men.

224
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,600
You're the only other person
who knows it's here.

225
00:50:15,400 --> 00:50:17,600
Brawkk... brawk, brawk... brawkk-AWK!

226
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,600
Hello, there!

227
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:37,100
I have to go.

228
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,100
Look, I don't know what I've...

229
00:52:22,400 --> 00:52:24,100
...disturbed here, but...

230
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,100
Why are you not wearing uniforms?

231
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:03,100
(Gunshots fired)

232
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:14,100
What will you do,...

233
00:54:14,750 --> 00:54:16,100
...when it is over?

234
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:21,100
Stay here.

235
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:29,100
You going home?

236
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,100
I have no home.

237
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,100
It was destroyed in a air raid.

238
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:37,100
The same one that took my wife.

239
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,300
I'm sorry.

240
00:55:07,100 --> 00:55:09,100
Do you kill people?

241
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:13,800
Yes.

242
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:22,600
You wouldn’t think it.

243
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,300
What are you doing?

244
00:56:22,600 --> 00:56:23,600
Sarah!

245
00:56:24,100 --> 00:56:25,600
I'm not in uniform.

246
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,600
Did you see anyone?

247
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:16,600
No.

248
00:58:24,600 --> 00:58:27,600
Everyone will be at the show.

249
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,600
Anyone who knows about Tom will
know about it.

250
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,600
He won't let us go.

251
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:35,600
The captain.

252
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,600
He will.

253
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:41,600
He'll have to.

254
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:50,600
I'll run the colt.

255
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,600
It's what Will would have wanted.

256
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:01,100
Isn't it better we leave the valley
before someone comes in?

257
00:59:01,500 --> 00:59:03,100
Somebody is bound to, soon enough.

258
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:05,100
Why not wait?

259
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:08,100
A couple of weeks and it
will maybe over.

260
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:10,100
We've got no milk.

261
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,100
On top of that, the cows are sick.

262
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:16,100
We'll be out of oil soon.

263
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:17,500
And then the heating coal.

264
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,550
The slaughtering, the sheering,
the hay.

265
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:21,600
We can manage.

266
00:59:21,700 --> 00:59:23,600
No we can't.

267
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,200
There is no need for you both to go.

268
00:59:42,100 --> 00:59:43,600
Gernot can go with you instead.

269
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,300
He handles the horses well, doesn't he?

270
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:50,600
Yes, but he doesn't speak English.

271
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,600
Have you ever seen a man
go mute with shell shock?

272
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:56,600
Say he is a cousin, from the front.

273
01:01:41,600 --> 01:01:44,600
Capt. Tooley for the 2 year old colt class.

274
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:45,500
Name?

275
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:46,600
Margaret Jones.

276
01:01:55,100 --> 01:01:58,100
Fine, that will be "124" then. Good luck.

277
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,100
Thank you.

278
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,300
Maggie?

279
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,300
Maggie!

280
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:10,100
Oh! I'm so pleased to see you.

281
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:12,100
Is Willis here?

282
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:15,100
No, he stayed on the farm.

283
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:17,100
Lots to catch up on after last winter.

284
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:21,100
Oh Maggie, you have no idea how
pleased I'm to hear that.

285
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,100
We don't know what to
believe these days.

286
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:26,100
They've got some of them on
the railway, see?

287
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,500
Just outside the depot.

288
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:30,500
Well, I feel silly saying this now,

289
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:34,000
but ah, someone said, one
of them was Will.

290
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,000
Felt ridiculous.

291
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:37,000
I said as much to my John.

292
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:41,000
"There is no way William Jones is mixed
up in all that."

293
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,000
I don't know why they're carrying on.

294
01:02:43,100 --> 01:02:44,500
They earned their troubles.

295
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:47,900
You know Vera's youngest was
in that lot they took

296
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:49,500
away after the bridge was blown.

297
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,500
Hung them all, they did.

298
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,600
Oh Maggie, it's so good to see you again.

299
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,600
How have you been keeping?

300
01:02:57,600 --> 01:03:00,000
Oh, you know, managing.

301
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:02,000
And Ruth? Reg, and the boys?

302
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:03,000
Doing fine.

303
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,500
Ah... Glad to hear it.

304
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,000
And do come around when you're
next in town, won't you?

305
01:03:08,500 --> 01:03:09,200
Yes.

306
01:04:46,400 --> 01:04:47,200
Maggie?

307
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,200
Cut himself on the way down.

308
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:53,000
Got a medal.

309
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,500
Played well.

310
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,700
Judges brought him in third.

311
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:02,200
What happened, Maggie?

312
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,400
Nothing different, really.

313
01:05:08,400 --> 01:05:13,700
There was some soldiers there, but
other than that, it doesn't matter.

314
01:05:13,700 --> 01:05:15,200
More or less.

315
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:19,700
Think most folk thought we’d
 copped it over the winter.

316
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,200
We'll talk in the morning, eh?

317
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:37,200
Then stay, Maggie.

318
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,200
There's something else
you might have to do.

319
01:07:25,700 --> 01:07:28,000
Something you will find difficult.

320
01:07:30,200 --> 01:07:32,200
Because collaboration...

321
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:35,200
...cannot be tolerated.

322
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:02,000
One thousand, two thousand,
three thousand...

323
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:06,500
BANG!

324
01:09:47,300 --> 01:09:48,000
Maggie?

325
01:09:56,200 --> 01:09:57,200
Maggie!

326
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:11,200
Maggie.

327
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:53,000
There will come a time, when people
will just want this to stop.

328
01:11:56,500 --> 01:11:58,000
And more than anything...

329
01:11:59,000 --> 01:12:01,000
they'll just want to survive.

330
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:09,000
But, what we have to ask ourselves is...

331
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:11,000
"How do we want to survive?"

332
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:17,000
"What... is worth surviving for?"

333
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
These are questions that cannot
be answered in words.

334
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:25,000
We'll need choices.

335
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:31,000
It is the choices that we make...

336
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,000
that will decide the nature
of our resistance.

337
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:39,000
The nature of our survival.

338
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,000
Our choices...

339
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,500
will be the mark...

340
01:12:44,850 --> 01:12:47,000
of who we are.

341
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Understand what I'm saying, George?

342
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:54,000
George?

343
01:12:58,500 --> 01:12:59,000
Yes.

344
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:14,000
George.

345
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:22,000
STEINER!

346
01:15:09,500 --> 01:15:11,000
Sarah, we must leave.

347
01:15:11,500 --> 01:15:14,000
Steiner has taken the radio. He
will contact local command.

348
01:15:16,000 --> 01:15:18,000
Do you understand what that means?

349
01:15:21,000 --> 01:15:23,000
Did they find out who shot the colt?

350
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:27,000
He'll report me, defense soldiers, and
staff will come with him.

351
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:40,000
You know I can't leave.

352
01:15:41,500 --> 01:15:44,000
Would you really rather
stay here and die?

353
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:54,000
Who are you making this sacrifice for?

354
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:07,000
This, will all stop one day.

355
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:11,000
And when it does, then you can
live as you wish.

356
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,000
Maybe even come back to the valley.

357
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:16,000
But if you stay now...

358
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,000
...then you die.

359
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
Where would we go?

360
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:44,000
West, to the coast, And then to Ireland.
And then if we need, to America.

361
01:16:48,000 --> 01:16:50,000
What about the other women?

362
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:55,300
It's too late.

363
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:58,500
I'm sorry.

364
01:17:12,300 --> 01:17:14,300
We don't have much time.

365
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:23,600
Alright.

366
01:17:27,100 --> 01:17:29,600
It is the right thing to do.

367
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:32,600
We must leave, now.

368
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:47,100
Maybe we'll need some clothes.

369
01:17:49,500 --> 01:17:51,100
I’ll get you some of Tom’s.

370
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:53,100
- I'll come with you.
- No.

371
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:57,700
They'll come for you first.

372
01:17:58,700 --> 01:18:00,700
It won't take long.

373
01:18:00,900 --> 01:18:02,700
- But I can't...
- Please.

374
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:23,700
Thank you, Sarah.

375
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:27,700
I know how hard this is.

376
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:32,700
Where should I met you?

377
01:18:35,700 --> 01:18:37,700
Behind Landor’s ruin.

378
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,300
Wait for me there.

379
01:18:46,700 --> 01:18:47,700
No.

380
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:48,100
"I can't stay here.

381
01:24:05,700 --> 01:24:08,100
"I have to come, and look for you.

382
01:24:19,100 --> 01:24:21,100
"Whatever that might mean.

383
01:24:39,300 --> 01:24:41,300
"I hope you understand."

384
01:30:41,300 --> 01:31:18,300
