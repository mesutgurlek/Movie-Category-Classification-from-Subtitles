1
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:16,135
Monday, august 2, 1907.

2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,893
It's six o'clock in the morning.

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:23,056
Today, my youngest son is going
to leave our home.

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,892
3 years of military Academy, and
he enters His Majesty'a Army.

5
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:33,292
I hoped his first assignment
would have been in town...

6
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,368
... or in a near village.

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:38,739
Instead, he leaves for
a loneIy fort...

8
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:41,136
... on the most distant border
of the empire...

9
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,295
Come on, wake up... it's six.

10
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:46,298
I'd like to be as happy as you...

11
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,253
... it's not your fault.

12
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,219
But I don't want to leave
with this memory of you.

13
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,658
I know what it all
means to you.

14
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,379
It's sad forthose who
are left behind.

15
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:26,657
Go now!

16
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,615
You're lucky...

17
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:54,610
You'll be hearing the famous
trumpets of Fort Bastiano every day!

18
00:04:55,460 --> 00:05:00,580
I don't even know what the fort
looks like, but it's very distant.

19
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,491
You'll be the one who is going
to live the most exciting adventure.

20
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,573
Do you see that grove there?

21
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:38,251
... when I'm gone beyond them,
you won't see me anymore.

22
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:56,170
Hey there... Hey!
Sir!

23
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,896
What is it?

24
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,211
Nothing, Sir... nothing... I just
wanted to salute you, that's all.

25
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:04,977
Who are you?

26
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:08,177
Lieutenant Drogo, Sir.

27
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:15,249
Go on! Go on... Our paths
will meet farther down.

28
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,938
- Captain Hortiz.
- Lieutenant Drogo.

29
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,169
I suppose on the way to Bastiano?

30
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,050
I'd given up hope of ever
finding the fort.

31
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:34,092
Why?

32
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,492
I must have taken
the wrong way, Sir, and...

33
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:38,936
If you're coming from that
direction, you certainly did.

34
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,770
Those mountains are the border
with the North Kingdom.

35
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,775
No Army could cross them from
either side.

36
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:48,336
There's never been a fort of
any kind around here. No need for it.

37
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:52,296
Bastiano is farther on...
to the north.

38
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:56,460
A messenger? And you don't know
the roads? Amazing!

39
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:00,609
I'm not, Sir. I'm reporting there
for duty. My first assignment.

40
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,415
Congratulations, Lieutenant. You
couldn't have made a better choice.

41
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,890
- Two years, I suppose.
- Sir?

42
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:14,410
That's the rule. Two years on the
border count double for seniority.

43
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:17,295
I didn't know that, Sir.
But I didn't choose Bastiano.

44
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:20,171
- No?
- I was ordered there.

45
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,334
Odd! Usually...

46
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,053
- Give me a drink, Strauss.
- Sir...

47
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,732
What's odd, Captain?

48
00:09:31,180 --> 00:09:33,569
There aren't many volunteers
for Bastiano these days...

49
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,214
That must explain
your orders.

50
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,288
- WouId you like a drink?
- Yes, please.

51
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:47,419
- Strauss!
- Thank you, Captain.

52
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,614
Bastiano is a dead border
station...

53
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,938
- ... as you will see.
- Thanks...

54
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,888
Only a pebble, Sir.

55
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,931
A splinter in the hoof.

56
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,899
What did the Captain mean by a
''dead border station''?

57
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:48,413
A border with nothing on the
other side of it. AbsoluteIy nothing.

58
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:55,174
Beyond the fort there is
a desert, Lieutenant Drogo...

59
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,132
And then... nothing.

60
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,298
- The Desert of the Tartars.
- The Tartars?

61
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,851
They may even have crossed the
desert once, a long time ago.

62
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:12,452
But they vanished, after
destroying the ancient city.

63
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:16,177
The desert has kept
their name.

64
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,138
The older a nation's history is,
the more legends spring up.

65
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:26,292
In the end, we don't know what's
true and what isn't.

66
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:34,456
I've been at Bastiano
for eighteen years.

67
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:38,093
I admit the place looks much more
beautiful inside than from out there.

68
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:45,817
I see you are in a hurry
to report.

69
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:47,656
Ride ahead.

70
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,177
Go... go ahead, Lieutenant.

71
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:05,810
Halt!

72
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:08,575
Advance and be recognized!

73
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:12,056
Lieutenant Drogo.
Assigned to Fort Bastiano.

74
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,817
I've come to take up my post.

75
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,294
Simeon.

76
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,170
Drogo, Sir.

77
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:50,493
Welcome to Bastiano.

78
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,090
Thank you.

79
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,855
Lazare!

80
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,575
First Sergent Tronk.

81
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,818
Take the Lieutenant's horse.

82
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,731
Come, I'll take you to meet
Major Matti.

83
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:12,648
- Take over, Tronk.
- But, that was a general aIarm!

84
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,330
What of it?

85
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:18,811
In case of alarm, the commissioned
officer on duty takes command.

86
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,895
That's regulation, Sir.

87
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:24,578
Paragraph 3 of the regulations,
Tronk. But paragraph 12 says:

88
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:29,975
''Guard posts not immediately
exposed to attack, which is this case...

89
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,099
may be placed underthe command of
a high-ranking non-commissioned officer''.

90
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,056
Any objections?

91
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,174
None, Sir.

92
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,010
Fine. Come with me,
Lieutenant Drogo.

93
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:47,018
It's not your fault, but you've
arrived at the worst possible moment.

94
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,375
I'm sorry, Sir.

95
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:51,538
Colonel, this is
Lieutenant Drogo.

96
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,618
I'm delighted to welcome you
to Bastiano.

97
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:05,734
The King himself has called us
''the noblest guardian of His Crown''.

98
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,730
Our garrison is an enviable assignment
for an ambitious young officer.

99
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:12,329
You'll soon see for yourself.

100
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:17,333
I'm listening, Lieutenant...

101
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,899
All positions ready to open fire on
the enemy 6 minutes after the aIarm.

102
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,652
Six minutes, you say?

103
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,414
Five minutes and 42 seconds.

104
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:38,096
A pity you're leaving us, Lieutenant...
As a soldier... I'll miss you.

105
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:43,172
If I may say so... I'll miss you too,
Sir... as a soldier.

106
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,688
You may go, Lieutenant.

107
00:16:55,660 --> 00:16:59,494
Good riddance! A fine efficer, but...
aII the same, good riddance!

108
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:06,738
WouId you Iike to be introduced to
His ExceIIency right now, or at mess?

109
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:10,380
This evening at mess, Sir.
It wiII be an honor.

110
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:39,335
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
My name's Rovine. I'm the doctor here.

111
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,414
Your medicaI fiIe arrived here
before you did. WeIcome to Bastiano.

112
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,416
Thanks, Sir.

113
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:02,570
Excuse me, CoIoneI. This is
Lieutenant Drogo.

114
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:07,334
- Sir...
- No, thank you.

115
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,732
Don't insist, I toId you.

116
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,538
Make up your mind. I can easiIy
wait anotherthree days.

117
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,893
I'm steaIing him from you.
Come, Drogo.

118
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,976
What's wrong with the
Lieutenant CoIoneI?

119
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,095
A gIorious battIe wound... when
there were stiII wars...

120
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,338
Broken back... SteeI corset...

121
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,129
He's the onIy one who's actuaIIy
been under fire.

122
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,729
I onIy suggested you'd be better
off stationed in town.

123
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,418
You've just come from the city...

124
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,979
... heIp me convince him!

125
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,337
- Keep out of this, Lieutenant.
- Be carefuI, pIease.

126
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:58,772
Getting invoIved in Rathenau's and
AmerIing's bickering can be dangerous!

127
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,052
Sirs! His ExceIIency!

128
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:24,738
WeIcome back, Hortiz. I hope
the traveI was fine.

129
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,128
Thanks, Sir.

130
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:31,729
Dear Nathanson, GeneraI Conrad
greets you.

131
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:35,575
He wouId Iike to have you for
the Army manoeuvres in the south.

132
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:38,129
WouId you... pIease...

133
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,133
Go on...

134
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:05,775
PIease, Sirs...

135
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:26,019
Lieutenant Drogo, Sir.
He has arrived this morning.

136
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:31,459
The Adjudant has my papers.

137
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,537
I request the honor of
introducing myseIf to you.

138
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:37,930
Jean Baptiste Drogo,

139
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:41,092
Infantry Lieutenant,
at your orders.

140
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,494
Good evening, your ExceIIency.

141
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,055
Good evening, gentIemen.

142
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:50,736
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.

143
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:53,489
His ExceIency, CoIoneI,
Count of FiIimore...

144
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,140
... commander in chief of the
garrison, invites you to join us.

145
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:57,649
CoIoneI Nathanson.

146
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,738
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
I am in command of your company.

147
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,339
Captain Hortiz.

148
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:13,250
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
I am in command of the garrison cannon.

149
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:14,973
Captain Von Sern.

150
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:19,211
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
I am the garrison physician.

151
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,569
Major doctor Rovine.

152
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,734
I am Simeon, senior subordinate
officer of the garrison.

153
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:27,329
Lieutenant Simeon.

154
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:31,496
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
I'm AmerIing.

155
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:32,935
Lieutenant Von AmerIing...

156
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:36,740
- Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
- Lieutenant Von Rathenau.

157
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:39,855
I'm Maude. Good evening,
Lieutenant Drogo.

158
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,209
Lieutenant Maude...

159
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:46,139
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
My name's Von Arnim.

160
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,133
Lieutenant Von Arnim.

161
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,935
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
I'm Sarteris.

162
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,139
Lieutenant Sarteris.

163
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,698
- Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
- Lieutenant Gothard...

164
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,377
Second Lieutenant MoreI.
- Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.

165
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,649
Second Lieutenant MoreI.

166
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:09,532
Good evening, Lieutenant Drogo.
WiII you dine with us?

167
00:22:10,020 --> 00:22:13,535
Thank you, ExceIIency. Thanks, Sirs.
I am honored.

168
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:56,374
You can't reaIIy see the desert untiI
you're at the advance post overthere.

169
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,259
What can you see from there?

170
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:05,931
Stones... sand... dust...

171
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:09,132
And aImost aIways, mist.

172
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:13,172
But further, to the north...
You must be abIe to see something?

173
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,976
Nothing but mist, winter
and summer.

174
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,174
StiII... there are some who insist...

175
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:38,809
... that they've seen riders
on white horses.

176
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,733
PatroIs from the North Kingdom?

177
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,498
Not necessariIy.

178
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,573
Where eIse wouId they come from?

179
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,454
From the desert.

180
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:09,132
If it were true, the GeneraI Staff
wouId know abouti it... peopIe wouId know.

181
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:12,935
There are things they prefer not
to taIk about, officiaIIy.

182
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:15,933
CoIoneI FiIimore
never mentions them.

183
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:21,209
- As for Hortiz...
- Captain Hortiz?

184
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,408
It was shortIy after
he got to Bastiano.

185
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,169
He was in charge of the outpost.

186
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,652
He saw them...

187
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,497
... just at the edge of the mist...

188
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,178
Hortiz saw the riders?

189
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,738
He even gave the aIarm...

190
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,771
He had a cannon shot fired.

191
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:55,332
A serious decision.

192
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:00,692
An officer Iike Hortiz
wouId never have done it.

193
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:03,812
... without being sure.

194
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:12,092
When dawn came, the riders
had disappeared.

195
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,854
So he was the onIy one
who saw them.

196
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,132
This morning he toId me Bastiano
was a dead border station...

197
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:24,130
... overIooking nothing.
He spoke of Iegends...

198
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,334
But aII the same he's stayed
on here, waiting...

199
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,733
Waiting for what?

200
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:38,896
The enemy. From the North Kingdom
or from the desert...

201
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,409
Hortiz may not beIieve
so strongIy, now...

202
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,733
... but he's waiting,
Iike the others...

203
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:04,571
CaIm down, CoIoneI... try to stay
caIm for a moment...

204
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,777
I'II heIp you, don't worry!

205
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:13,135
How can I make you an injection?

206
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,171
CaIm!

207
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,929
Give me a hand!

208
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,129
HoId him! Hurry!

209
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,289
Keep him stiII!

210
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:29,655
What is he saying?

211
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,136
He wants you to put your
hand ovre his mouth.

212
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,293
Keep him stiII!

213
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,652
You can Iet him go, Lieutenant.

214
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:57,649
The drug acts aImost
immediateIy.

215
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:30,131
- Ijust can't beIieve it, you know...
- What?

216
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,733
That I'II be back in town...
in two days...

217
00:29:34,500 --> 00:29:38,015
... and I won't see this
fort anymore... but you...

218
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,731
You'II be seeing my famiIy?

219
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:48,011
There's stiII time. I'II wait
for you... Why don't you?

220
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,331
No...

221
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,700
I toId you, I Iike Bastiano,
and I feeI fine.

222
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,530
Anyway, that's what you're
to teII my mother.

223
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:16,249
Promise me.

224
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:19,011
What eIse can I teII her, the truth?

225
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,096
That everyday, you are cIosest
to the suicide, here at Bastiano?

226
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:33,496
You mustn't be Iate.

227
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,739
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

228
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:12,892
Very weII! You've been frank with
me, and I'II be frank with you.

229
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:22,139
Twice a year, we aII have a
medicaI examination.

230
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:26,373
Me... Lieutenant CoIoneI Nathanson...
the CoIoneI himseIf.

231
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:28,651
Everybody. It's reguIation.

232
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:36,738
When yourturn comes, I promise to
get you a negative report.

233
00:31:39,140 --> 00:31:41,734
You can count on me.
Is that cIear, Lieutenant?

234
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:45,012
Yes, Sir. I don't know
how to thank you.

235
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:55,859
The next examination wiII be
in four months' time.

236
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,217
Four months?

237
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,537
That's the best I can do, Lieutenant.

238
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:05,369
What if I wouId send in an appIication?

239
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:08,778
There's your careerto think of.

240
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:14,211
AppIying for a transfer at your
first assignment couId harm you.

241
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:20,252
According to my suggestion, you'II
have time to show what you can do.

242
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:23,659
Four months... that's not so bad!

243
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:26,820
I beIieve you're right, Sir...

244
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,009
I'm going to take your advice.

245
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:36,051
Good! Keep it a secret!
Just between you and me.

246
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,695
Good morning, Sir.

247
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:07,935
Lieutenant Drogo...

248
00:33:08,540 --> 00:33:12,215
Your pIatoon moved in ahead of
Lieutenant Sartoris' at roII caII.

249
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,092
He's your senior, here.

250
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:16,814
Lieutenant Sarteris' pIatoon
was Iate, Sir...

251
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,135
Stay in your pIace!

252
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,898
Your men are weII discipIined,
Lieutenant, congratuIations.

253
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:32,137
So I'm aII the more sorry you
made the decision to Ieave us.

254
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,128
Don't be surprised...

255
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:37,858
Everybody knows about your
agreement with Major Matti.

256
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:49,017
You know, many young officers
have come to Bastiano just Iike you.

257
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:54,699
And those who have chosen to
stay, don't feeI inferior.

258
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,417
I neverthought anything
Iike that, Sir.

259
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,290
I wanted a different assignment.

260
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:02,656
It was mere chance that I was
sent here.

261
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:05,493
And if the chance wants
you to stay?

262
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,011
Maybe that's what happened to me.

263
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,533
It's more probabIe that chance
had nothing to do with any of it.

264
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,689
CIose ranks, Lazare!
Get a move on!

265
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:56,210
- Come on, you stupid muIe!
- Lazare! Move on!

266
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,217
- March!
- Come on, move!

267
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:11,170
Coming off Guard... Be carefuI!

268
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,499
Present arms!

269
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:39,973
PIatoon, haIt!

270
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,338
Ground arms!

271
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:50,653
Coming off guard, ground arms!
Stand at ease!

272
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,730
- Is this your first duty out here?
- Yes.

273
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:55,499
Rather boring, but you get used
to it. You'II see.

274
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:09,650
Night faIIs earIy, this time
of year...

275
00:36:10,180 --> 00:36:13,377
Sooner or Iater, in this darkness,
something's going to happen.

276
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:17,292
The CoIoneI shouId be warned
of the danger.

277
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,138
What danger?

278
00:36:21,620 --> 00:36:24,134
You see Lieutenant AmerIing's
unit?

279
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:28,135
It'II be dark when they get back
to the fort.

280
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:33,378
Lieutenant AmerIing, Iike you,
Sir, has three different passwords.

281
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,778
The one who was vaIid when he
Ieft, the one he used here...

282
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:39,730
... and the one he wiII need
to reenterthe fort.

283
00:36:39,980 --> 00:36:43,017
Because, meanwhiIe, the guards
wouId have come off duty.

284
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:45,539
- What of it?
- WeII...

285
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:50,736
Suppose that the onIy officer who
knows the password faIIs sick...

286
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:54,410
In that case, the guard coming off
duty wouIdn't be Iet into the fort.

287
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:58,215
Beacuse onIy that officer must
give the password.

288
00:36:58,860 --> 00:37:02,535
- The sentries wouId recognize them.
- In the dark?

289
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:06,418
And what if the returning guard
was attacked by surprise...

290
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,617
... and wiped out by an enemy
patroI between here and the fort?

291
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:13,929
The enemy soIdiers couId
put on our uniforms.

292
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,489
True.

293
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:20,136
Without the password, Sir,
nobody coming from the North VaIIey,

294
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:23,417
... and I mean nobody, can
enterthe front.

295
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,136
Tronk!

296
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:10,058
- Tronk!
- At your orders, Sir.

297
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:16,738
Tronk... I may be mistaken...
But it seems to me... out there...

298
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,333
- Look! Look!
- What is it?

299
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,975
Something out there, straight!

300
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:24,933
Everybody back to your posts!
CIam down the horses!

301
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,774
It's coming this way!

302
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:29,812
No, it's moving, not toward us.

303
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,732
Back to your posts, not a sound!

304
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,697
- DoubIe the guard, CorporaI.
- Yes, Sir.

305
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:38,257
- You! Up to the pIatform!
- Yes, Sir!

306
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,370
- Ready at the cannons!
- Yes, Sir.

307
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:44,378
- Everybody on position!
- It vanished, now.

308
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:47,054
- I can't see nothing, now.
- Machinegun ready to fire!

309
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,928
They can teII...

310
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:54,729
What do you mean?

311
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,817
The horses, they can feeI
them coming.

312
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,694
Them who? Shut up!

313
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,334
From where?

314
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:16,736
And who...

315
00:39:20,940 --> 00:39:25,775
There's onIy desert...
miIes of desert...

316
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:37,735
Tronk...

317
00:39:40,740 --> 00:39:41,809
WouId you give the aIarm?

318
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:51,970
Fire the cannon is an
heavy decision.

319
00:39:53,380 --> 00:39:56,133
In a coupIe of minutes, the
fort wiII be on war.

320
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:02,215
I'd wait tiII dawn, Sir.

321
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,093
What do you think of that, Tronk?

322
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:24,292
Nothing yet, Sir.

323
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,937
Ask the corporaI to come here.
Then get back to your cannon.

324
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:30,135
Yes, Sir.

325
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,976
AII right.

326
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:37,499
Now teII me what you think.

327
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,294
That horse isn't from Bastiano,
Sir.

328
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:46,617
Maybe you haven't noticed. At
Bastiano aII the horses are bIack or bay.

329
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,815
Where wouId it come from?

330
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:56,455
ReIieve the night guard,
CorporaI.

331
00:40:56,700 --> 00:41:01,216
Put three gunners at the cannon,
ready to fire.

332
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,536
Tronk...

333
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:10,651
WouId you advise me to give
the aIarm, now?

334
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:12,932
No Sir, not yet...

335
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:16,453
But we shouId be prepared to,
any moment.

336
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:22,299
That horse. What is the danger
of a Ione horse?

337
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:24,933
Might mean danger is on the way.

338
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,412
From the North Kingdom?

339
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,652
Their horsemen have never
ventured into the desert...

340
00:41:33,660 --> 00:41:34,615
At Ieast, not untiI now...

341
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:39,978
Then speak out, Tronk! I want
to hear you say the word!

342
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,254
Tartars, Sir...
It's a Tartar horse.

343
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,818
Nothing's going to happen.

344
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,133
No one's coming.

345
00:42:10,980 --> 00:42:14,939
We spent our whoIe day
staring at that horse.

346
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:19,011
Lazare, on your post!

347
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:21,134
I know how you feeI, Sir...

348
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:25,739
But the border is just
beIow us...

349
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,609
- ReguIations are reguIations.
- What of it?

350
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,694
Bet that horse out there never
heard of your reguIations!

351
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,334
AII right, Tronk...

352
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:44,372
I won't send anyone to bring
the horse in...

353
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:48,052
... since it's against reguIations.

354
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:51,856
Our reIief wiII be here
in an hour.

355
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:01,609
And it wiII soon be dark...

356
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,619
- Who goes there?
- Guard returning from the out post.

357
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:18,738
- Give the password!
- Sword and banner.

358
00:43:19,020 --> 00:43:20,135
Open the door!

359
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:51,449
Guards, haIt! Stay at ease.

360
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,655
- CaII the roII Tronk, and dismiss.
- Yes, Sir.

361
00:43:56,500 --> 00:43:59,014
- CorporaI, caII the roII.
- Yes, Sir.

362
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:02,339
- Merru...
- Present.

363
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:03,734
- Sveta...
- Present.

364
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,254
- Vinovich...
- Present.

365
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:06,739
- FiIey...
- Present.

366
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,333
- Fritz...
- Present.

367
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:09,813
- Haus...
- Present.

368
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:11,055
Lazare...

369
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,210
- Lazare!
- Present.

370
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:18,172
That horse shouId have been
captured.

371
00:44:19,580 --> 00:44:21,411
But, reguIations, Sir?

372
00:44:21,580 --> 00:44:26,051
An officer must take
responsibiIity, sometimes.

373
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:27,335
You may go now, Major.

374
00:44:34,780 --> 00:44:35,815
Stay, Lieutenant.

375
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,137
You behaved wiseIy, Lieutenant.

376
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:46,215
First, not by aIerting the fort.
Am I right, ExceIIency?

377
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:50,857
It was just a horse without
an horseman.

378
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:55,730
SecondIy, you foIIowed reguIations
to the Ietter.

379
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,294
I congratuIate you, Lieutenant.

380
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:01,216
A border is a border...

381
00:45:02,020 --> 00:45:07,174
OnIy His ExceIIency couId have taken
the initiative to capture the horse.

382
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,616
Do you think that horse beIonged
to a miIitary unit?

383
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,251
- Answer me, Captain.
- No, I don't think so.

384
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:25,138
StiII, you admit the incident is
suspect from an army standpoint.

385
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,090
Yes, Sir.

386
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:29,417
Then why haven't you
doubIed the guard?

387
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,448
Those are the times when the
reguIations shouId be appIied strictIy.

388
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:44,135
Come, Lieutenant.

389
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:55,735
- A white horse, you say?
- Yes, ExceIIency.

390
00:45:56,660 --> 00:45:57,854
CoIoneI, pIease.

391
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,338
I'm honored, CoIoneI.

392
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:04,092
- No speciaI marks?
- No, Sir. Nothing.

393
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,174
No saddIe.

394
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:10,849
- It must have gone away by now.
- No doubt, your ExceIIency.

395
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:18,811
Do you think I shouId have
trespass the borderto catch it?

396
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,660
ReguIation is reguIation,
Lieutenant.

397
00:46:21,860 --> 00:46:24,374
It's certainIy His ExceIIency's
opinion.

398
00:46:25,580 --> 00:46:26,899
You may go now, Major!

399
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:42,334
You must not bIame yourseIf
Lieutenant.

400
00:46:42,820 --> 00:46:47,530
The Major is unfortunateIy
right. We can do nothing about it.

401
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:03,535
- Who goes there?
- Private Lazare, muIe driver.

402
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:07,893
Listen, friend. I've broken
reguIations, try to keep it quiet.

403
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,332
I've got a horse, here.

404
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:13,340
Advance and give the password!

405
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,299
The password?
How shouId I know it?

406
00:47:18,260 --> 00:47:22,890
Didn't you hear about the horse?
Look, I'm bringing it in.

407
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:26,929
Are you going to open up or not?

408
00:47:27,260 --> 00:47:30,809
- The password!
- I toId you... I don't know it!

409
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:36,413
My name's Lazare. You must
recognize me. I can't make out your face.

410
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:43,379
What are you doing? You're not
going to shoot!

411
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:45,976
No! Don't shoot! No!

412
00:47:48,820 --> 00:47:50,412
- AIert!
- AIert!

413
00:47:50,540 --> 00:47:52,974
- AIert!
- Everybody on his posts!

414
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:02,812
- Open the door.
- You can't get out, Sir.

415
00:48:03,020 --> 00:48:04,135
Get off!

416
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:12,735
Lazare!

417
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:29,256
Right in the middIe of
the forehead. Who fired?

418
00:49:30,620 --> 00:49:32,133
Private Kupka, Sir.

419
00:49:35,700 --> 00:49:38,498
First rate shot.
I trained him myseIf.

420
00:49:40,020 --> 00:49:43,251
- And what's this one's name?
- Private Lazare, Sir.

421
00:49:43,780 --> 00:49:44,735
A diserter...

422
00:49:44,900 --> 00:49:49,690
As weekIy duty officer, it's my
job to find out how the tragedy occurred.

423
00:49:50,100 --> 00:49:55,777
Tragedy? Stop being dramatic,
Captain!

424
00:49:56,380 --> 00:50:00,737
Lazare tried to bring the horse
back to the fort.

425
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:02,777
The sentry can testify.

426
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:07,974
He'II testify! He'II prove this
soIdier was a traitor!

427
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:16,572
You aIso have a few things
to expIain, Lieutenant.

428
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,736
This soIdier was one of
your guard, wasn't he?

429
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:20,049
Yes, Sir.

430
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:23,490
His disobedience couId be the
cause of a serious incident.

431
00:50:23,780 --> 00:50:27,739
The North Kingdom might protest
for border vioIation!

432
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:29,413
You can't be serious.

433
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,416
DeaI with this, Tronk.

434
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:40,578
Have him buried...
Without honors!

435
00:50:40,860 --> 00:50:41,815
Yes, Sir.

436
00:51:23,660 --> 00:51:24,615
Sir!

437
00:51:29,380 --> 00:51:32,452
- Order... arms.
- Yes, Sir.

438
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:39,819
Order... arms!

439
00:51:41,220 --> 00:51:43,814
Order... arms!

440
00:52:05,260 --> 00:52:08,332
Order... arms!

441
00:52:17,380 --> 00:52:20,019
Order... arms!

442
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,212
Order... arms!

443
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:57,974
What's going on?

444
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:06,140
Tronk, what's going on!

445
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,653
The third pIatoon refuses to obey
orders, Sir...

446
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,452
It's private Lazare's section.

447
00:53:12,220 --> 00:53:14,780
Refused to present arms
before the fIag.

448
00:53:18,060 --> 00:53:19,129
Refusing to obey...

449
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:36,171
These men beIong to your
company, Captain...

450
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,378
And to your section, Lieutenant!

451
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:45,699
I demand a report,
immediateIy!

452
00:53:59,140 --> 00:54:01,495
Order... arms!

453
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:18,614
You bastards...

454
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:40,135
Let them stand there. Without
food and water...

455
00:54:40,380 --> 00:54:42,132
... As Iong as they refuse to obey!

456
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,412
At ease!

457
00:55:05,140 --> 00:55:06,812
My report, your ExceIIency.

458
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:15,530
What do you want from them,
Major?

459
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:20,497
First, their submission.
Then, I want them severeIy punished.

460
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:32,171
The dead soIdier was one
of them, wasn't he?

461
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:35,055
That's no excuse, ExceIIency.

462
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:40,055
Those men refused to present arms
before their officers and the fIag!

463
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,940
And they didn't obey,
insuIting me.

464
00:56:08,340 --> 00:56:11,138
Order... arms!

465
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,818
Present'arm!

466
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:30,417
Excort these men to their
ceIIs, Sergeant.

467
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:32,611
Four days of bread and water.

468
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:57,452
You have heart condition, this
aItitude is bad for your system.

469
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,538
WiII that do?

470
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,818
Perfect. Thank you.

471
00:57:04,260 --> 00:57:08,048
Bastiano is probabIy bad
for everyone.

472
00:57:08,260 --> 00:57:10,330
I'm not sure God himseIf
couId survive here.

473
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:12,451
You're thinking of
AmerIing's iIIness?

474
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:15,649
Yes... he's not the onIy one.

475
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:24,736
Some nasty germs have been
trapped in these waIIs for centuries...

476
00:57:24,940 --> 00:57:26,896
There's no cure.

477
00:57:27,140 --> 00:57:30,815
And it's impossibIe
to diagnose.

478
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:33,818
Even the speciaIists in the
capitaI are at a Ioss.

479
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:42,648
- You're wise to Ieave.
- That's not the reason...

480
00:57:42,780 --> 00:57:44,293
I was sent here by mistake.

481
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:49,135
Here, eIsewhere... we're aII
somewhere by mistake.

482
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:52,730
You're wise.
If I couId, I myseIf...

483
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:54,931
CouIdn't you ask for
a transfer?

484
00:57:55,620 --> 00:58:01,138
I couId, of course... but
I'd feeI Iike a deserter...

485
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:09,132
With that certificate, you can
Ieave whenever you Iike.

486
00:58:09,740 --> 00:58:11,696
AII you need is the
GeneraI's signature...

487
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:15,539
You're Iucky, he'II be
here in two weeks.

488
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:19,614
Quickerthan sending it to town
and waiting for an answer.

489
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:22,335
Thank you.

490
00:58:22,860 --> 00:58:25,135
- Goodbye, Lieutenant.
- Goodbye.

491
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:18,095
Touched!

492
00:59:23,540 --> 00:59:28,534
You're first rate, AmerIing, but
I'm not as young as you are.

493
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:31,732
You're not even
out of breathe.

494
00:59:32,660 --> 00:59:35,413
You think I can't Iast
to the end?

495
00:59:36,180 --> 00:59:40,059
I reaIIy wouId Iike to stop,
but if you want to continue...

496
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:42,055
Thank you, Sir.

497
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:49,655
Thank you.

498
01:01:20,180 --> 01:01:24,253
Garrison!

499
01:01:32,420 --> 01:01:34,012
On your knees!

500
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:41,658
Lord, I'm afraid, and I pIace my
trust in Thee, Father...

501
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,215
O Lord, grant us peace!

502
01:01:44,580 --> 01:01:48,334
Turn not Thy face away.

503
01:01:49,180 --> 01:01:52,331
BIess my souI and wash away
my sins.

504
01:01:52,580 --> 01:01:55,492
Jesus, have mercy upon us.

505
01:01:55,780 --> 01:02:00,296
Saturday night, as the first day
of the week was dawning...

506
01:02:00,460 --> 01:02:04,214
Mary MagdaIene and
the other Maria, after bought some essences...

507
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:07,929
... came to see Jesus' sepuIchre
to embaIm him.

508
01:02:08,940 --> 01:02:11,693
And then an angeI came, it
descended from up above...

509
01:02:12,500 --> 01:02:14,616
It knocked overthe stone,
and sat on it.

510
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:18,729
It seemed Iike a thunder,
and with a dress so shining...

511
01:02:19,020 --> 01:02:23,650
The guards, frightened, faIIen
on the ground as they were dead.

512
01:02:23,780 --> 01:02:26,738
The AngeI smiIed to the
women and said:

513
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:31,650
''Don't be afraid, the man you
are Iooking for, isn't here.''

514
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:37,056
He rose again from the death,
on the third day, as he had foretoId...

515
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:42,653
... and has gone to GaIiIea.
Go, and meet him there.

516
01:02:56,380 --> 01:02:58,098
They have swords, and shieIds.

517
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:03,454
Who, Sir?

518
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:06,816
The horsemen in the desert.

519
01:03:06,980 --> 01:03:08,857
The men I saw once, a Iong
time ago.

520
01:03:09,780 --> 01:03:11,179
They ride white horses.

521
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:15,616
They don't want anyone to see
their swords gIeaming in the sun.

522
01:03:16,500 --> 01:03:21,415
They Iet them tarnish.
An oId warriors' trick.

523
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:24,772
Is that what you
wanted to know?

524
01:03:25,900 --> 01:03:27,219
Why I stayed here?

525
01:03:31,020 --> 01:03:32,009
To wait forthem.

526
01:04:37,620 --> 01:04:40,532
- Captain Hortiz.
- Good evening, Captain.

527
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:41,935
Your ExceIIency...

528
01:04:42,620 --> 01:04:43,655
Our dear Nathanson...

529
01:04:43,820 --> 01:04:47,699
- I'm happy to see you, how is it?
- Good, ExceIIency, better.

530
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:51,373
- Lieutenants Von AmerIing...
- Sir.

531
01:04:53,100 --> 01:04:55,250
- ... Von Arnim...
- ExceIIency...

532
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,418
- ... Maude.
- Sir.

533
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:01,492
Lieutenant Gothard,
- Honored.

534
01:05:02,660 --> 01:05:03,615
GIad to see you, ExceIIency.

535
01:05:06,780 --> 01:05:08,657
- Lieutenant Sarteris.
- Your ExceIIency.

536
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:14,178
Your mother is my wife' s friend.
They meet often.

537
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:18,779
She aIways asks me about
you, I'II teII herthat we have met.

538
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,299
Thank you very much, Sir.

539
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:24,574
- Lieutenant MoreI.
- Good evening.

540
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:26,453
Good evening, Lieutenant.

541
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:32,130
- Major Mattis.
- Nice to see you.

542
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,455
Honored.

543
01:05:34,580 --> 01:05:36,775
- Captain Von Sern...
- Captain...

544
01:05:39,260 --> 01:05:41,728
- Lieutenant Simeon.
- Ah, Simeon...

545
01:05:42,580 --> 01:05:45,333
I know your father, we were
together in the academy.

546
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:46,415
ExceIIency, I know...

547
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:51,536
- This is Lieutenant Drogo.
- Lieutenant...

548
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,736
... you're new at Bastiano,
aren't you...

549
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,649
I've been here four months, Sir.

550
01:05:55,780 --> 01:05:58,658
Lieutenant Drogo is one of the
garrison's best officer.

551
01:05:58,860 --> 01:06:02,330
I'm not surprised, Bastiano
attracts aII of our best young men.

552
01:06:02,540 --> 01:06:05,338
- I'm happy to see you here.
- Dinner is served.

553
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:06,655
This way, ExceIIency.

554
01:06:08,140 --> 01:06:11,132
Let's have dinner! The ceremony
has given me appetite.

555
01:06:11,340 --> 01:06:14,332
I envy you: the finest parades,
the finest officers...

556
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:19,090
... the finest cook. What's
Bastiano's weak spot?

557
01:06:46,580 --> 01:06:50,050
- Is something going wrong?
- No doctor, nothing.

558
01:06:51,580 --> 01:06:53,810
ShaII I have the GeneraI sign
your certificate for you?

559
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:55,015
No, Sir. Thank you.

560
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,136
WeII, then come and sit.
Don't just stand there.

561
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:24,339
There he is!

562
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:26,575
In there!

563
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:31,932
- Missed him that time.
- You missed it, not me.

564
01:09:05,800 --> 01:09:10,828
Don't provoke me with
this kind of games.

565
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:13,993
Neither with others.
You wouId Iose in any case.

566
01:09:16,320 --> 01:09:17,389
Yes, untiI it's a game.

567
01:09:20,560 --> 01:09:22,915
Look! Overthere...

568
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:43,349
- How many did you say?
- One company, I shouId say.

569
01:09:46,960 --> 01:09:52,637
That soIdier... who brought the
horse back to Bastiano...

570
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,315
... you remember, Drogo?

571
01:09:57,000 --> 01:09:58,513
Yes Sir, I remember.

572
01:10:03,040 --> 01:10:07,795
It's too bad we never found where
that horse was from... Come in, pIease.

573
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:14,149
Your ExceIIency...

574
01:10:17,240 --> 01:10:22,268
The enemy wiII be in sight of
Bastiano in a few minutes.

575
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,032
- Did you say ''the enemy'', Major?
- Yes, your ExceIIency.

576
01:10:28,200 --> 01:10:32,034
They are advancing armed,
according to the ruIes of war.

577
01:10:32,360 --> 01:10:36,831
They hope to take us by surprise,
after skirting the desert...

578
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,076
Thank you, Major.

579
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:46,229
Your ExceIIency, aren't you going
to order a generaI aIarm?

580
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:53,029
As aIways, I appreciate your
sense of duty, Major.

581
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:58,115
Inform the officers to report
to me here, as usuaI, in 10 minutes.

582
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:01,319
- But, Your ExceIIency...
- You may go now, Major.

583
01:11:10,120 --> 01:11:11,633
Stay Lieutenant, pIease...

584
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:20,432
Stay, pIease.

585
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:31,077
What's the meaning of aII this
confusion? Go back to your pIaces!

586
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:35,314
You've no business here!
CIearthe parapet! Move!

587
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:44,195
CoIoneI, here are the
officiaIs.

588
01:12:01,840 --> 01:12:03,876
Sit down, pIease, CoIoneI
Nathanson.

589
01:12:13,120 --> 01:12:14,439
Sit down, gentIemen.

590
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,876
Did you want to say something,
Major?

591
01:12:21,040 --> 01:12:24,112
There are more on the way, Your
ExceIIency, more aII the time.

592
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:28,199
They're spreading out aIong the
border. You can see them from the window.

593
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:29,719
I don't think so.

594
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:33,433
Stay where you are, Major.

595
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:40,635
I'II ask you to Iook out, if
I feeI it necessary.

596
01:12:53,840 --> 01:12:57,879
I'm sorry to have to say this:

597
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:00,194
I have noticed more than once...

598
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:11,392
... that, during the changing
of the guard, some units arrive...

599
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,511
... without their commanding
officers...

600
01:13:13,640 --> 01:13:16,837
Your ExceIIency, we're
wasting vaIuabIe time!

601
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:28,358
Lieutenant MaIevic, ExceIIency.

602
01:13:28,480 --> 01:13:32,439
I bring a message from the Chief
of the GeneraI Staff.

603
01:13:37,400 --> 01:13:39,118
Excuse me, gentIemen.

604
01:14:09,960 --> 01:14:13,270
Thank you, Lieutenant. You
must be exhausted.

605
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,034
Lieutenant Von Arnim
wiII Iook after you.

606
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:25,518
GentIemen...

607
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:31,031
This morning, our soIdiers
and you too...

608
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,519
... were troubIed...

609
01:14:33,160 --> 01:14:38,712
... by the presence of foreign
troops in the North VaIIey.

610
01:14:40,480 --> 01:14:44,155
The troops are from
the North Kingdom,

611
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,633
sent here simpIy to survey
the border Iine,

612
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,399
as we did ourseIves a
few years ago.

613
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:55,035
Good...

614
01:14:55,840 --> 01:15:00,436
The units in question wiII not
come to Bastiano.

615
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:04,638
They won't.

616
01:15:05,160 --> 01:15:11,156
They'II break up in smaII groups,
to carry on the mission in the mountains.

617
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:18,035
That is the message sent from
the Chief of the GeneraI Staff.

618
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:23,675
He aIso asks me to organize an
expedition without deIay...

619
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:29,434
... to estabIish the border Iine on
our side in one mountain area...

620
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:33,390
... where it hasn't yet been
surveyed.

621
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:42,950
I need hardIy add that it wouId
be best we reached first...

622
01:15:43,240 --> 01:15:48,234
to take possession without
incident.

623
01:15:51,360 --> 01:15:55,035
ExceIIency, I'm the onIy
Engineer co-officer, here.

624
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:57,913
WiII you authorize me to
command the expedition?

625
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:02,632
Yes, of course. Pick the men
you need and Ieave at dawn.

626
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,833
Have them take warm cIothing.

627
01:16:10,520 --> 01:16:12,829
You can Ieave.

628
01:17:16,117 --> 01:17:18,108
You're going to have a hard time
waIking in those things.

629
01:17:19,117 --> 01:17:21,187
I don't want any deIays.

630
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:22,956
And they're going to hurt.

631
01:19:03,277 --> 01:19:04,790
- Sergeant!
- Yes, Sir.

632
01:19:07,717 --> 01:19:10,914
- We'II camp here.
- PIatoon, haIt!

633
01:19:11,237 --> 01:19:13,114
Have the first unit set up
theirtents here?

634
01:19:14,757 --> 01:19:16,987
The men who wiII go on top
can rest.

635
01:19:17,277 --> 01:19:18,312
Yes, Sir.

636
01:19:20,877 --> 01:19:23,232
Sergeant, set up the tents,
and discharge the muIes...

637
01:19:23,357 --> 01:19:24,107
Hey, you...

638
01:19:24,237 --> 01:19:27,388
... Iight the fire, and
distribute the meaIs.

639
01:19:29,637 --> 01:19:31,514
I see you're in exceIIent form.

640
01:19:31,957 --> 01:19:34,107
Thank you, Sir.

641
01:19:34,597 --> 01:19:37,748
A pity we don't come up here
more often. Magnificent view!

642
01:19:37,917 --> 01:19:40,909
In that case, you can come with
me on the cIimb.

643
01:19:41,197 --> 01:19:43,108
That's what you want,
isn't it?

644
01:19:44,477 --> 01:19:45,956
I wasn't expecting such an honor.

645
01:19:46,237 --> 01:19:50,708
Don't ever Ioose the contact
with the person that's towards you.

646
01:19:53,557 --> 01:19:57,106
If you get Iost, fire 3 shots.

647
01:19:57,677 --> 01:20:00,510
We'II stop and fire. So you
can reach us.

648
01:20:01,037 --> 01:20:06,111
Don't put off your gIoves!

649
01:20:07,997 --> 01:20:09,112
You, cover up your head!

650
01:20:21,877 --> 01:20:24,391
PIatoon!

651
01:20:32,837 --> 01:20:35,351
Twenty soIdiers,
two non commissioned officer.

652
01:20:37,397 --> 01:20:39,706
- WeII, Lieutenant.
- Goodbye, Captain.

653
01:21:04,237 --> 01:21:05,192
Goodbye, Drogo.

654
01:21:07,077 --> 01:21:08,032
Goodbye.

655
01:21:23,557 --> 01:21:26,913
- With God's heIp... Iet's go.
- PIatoon, ready!

656
01:21:27,157 --> 01:21:29,512
Go, ahead!

657
01:23:12,477 --> 01:23:16,789
I wish I couId go with you, Drogo.
To AmerIing's famiIy, teII his mother...

658
01:23:18,637 --> 01:23:20,514
You'II know what to say, I'm sure.

659
01:23:23,677 --> 01:23:25,633
WiII you be coming back, Drogo?

660
01:23:27,397 --> 01:23:28,512
I don't know, Sir.

661
01:23:30,997 --> 01:23:33,591
I'II go see the GeneraI.

662
01:23:59,077 --> 01:23:59,907
See you...

663
01:25:04,517 --> 01:25:07,509
You're asking me to Ieave
Bastiano? This is impossibIe!

664
01:25:08,317 --> 01:25:11,115
I'm not asking you, Major.
I have made my decision.

665
01:25:11,277 --> 01:25:14,110
It's not reguIation... onIy
the GeneraI...

666
01:25:14,237 --> 01:25:18,833
The GeneraI promised me that
he'd give you a spIendid assignment,

667
01:25:19,637 --> 01:25:25,906
... where your remarkabIe abiIity
to command, wiII be appreciated.

668
01:25:26,437 --> 01:25:29,713
Your sudden interest in me
is surprising, Your ExceIIency.

669
01:25:31,357 --> 01:25:36,556
No surprise! I've aIways
appreciated your devotion to duty...

670
01:25:36,957 --> 01:25:38,515
But I don't beIong to your worId!

671
01:25:38,997 --> 01:25:39,986
That's the probIem, isn't it?

672
01:25:40,157 --> 01:25:44,196
You've never considered me the
equaI of officers of your cIass.

673
01:25:44,957 --> 01:25:49,508
You put up with me...

674
01:25:49,997 --> 01:25:54,070
Let me handIe the jobs you didn't
want to touch yourseIf.

675
01:25:56,037 --> 01:25:58,392
But you never had anything
but contempt for me!

676
01:25:59,957 --> 01:26:03,472
Now, because of AmerIing, you
insist on my Ieaving.

677
01:26:06,437 --> 01:26:08,587
You hoId me responsibIe
for his death!

678
01:26:15,517 --> 01:26:19,066
You're the one who feeIs Iike
that, and you're aImost pIeased.

679
01:26:20,357 --> 01:26:21,312
You're quite mistaken!

680
01:26:26,997 --> 01:26:29,750
You had nothing to do with
the death of AmerIing.

681
01:26:31,637 --> 01:26:32,592
AbsoIuteIy nothing!

682
01:26:34,397 --> 01:26:39,596
It's something you can't
understand. Beyond anything you are...

683
01:26:42,077 --> 01:26:44,545
... or ever can be!

684
01:26:52,037 --> 01:26:54,505
Here is your promotion to the
rank of Lieutenant-CoIoneI.

685
01:26:55,637 --> 01:26:56,592
My congratuIations.

686
01:27:44,197 --> 01:27:46,028
Lieutenant, the GeneraI's
right arm?

687
01:27:56,917 --> 01:27:58,111
Lieutenant, the GeneraI.

688
01:28:03,317 --> 01:28:05,990
... Bastiano! Yes...

689
01:28:06,637 --> 01:28:07,831
PIease, come in.

690
01:28:09,757 --> 01:28:14,069
Ah... You at Bastiano gave us
pIenty of troubIes...

691
01:28:14,397 --> 01:28:16,115
... overthe border matter.

692
01:28:16,237 --> 01:28:20,389
His Highness accept no compromise
where a piece of empire is envoIved.

693
01:28:21,037 --> 01:28:24,393
A mountain peak is a mountain
peak. What's his name?

694
01:28:24,677 --> 01:28:26,030
Von AmerIing, Sir.

695
01:28:27,117 --> 01:28:28,106
Count Peter Von AmerIing.

696
01:28:29,437 --> 01:28:33,794
Hard headed deviI! His stubborness
Iost us a mountain peak.

697
01:28:34,437 --> 01:28:36,997
Sir, AmerIing is the one
who died.

698
01:28:37,997 --> 01:28:39,794
Ah, is that so?

699
01:28:41,957 --> 01:28:42,946
PIease, stay down.

700
01:28:44,557 --> 01:28:51,315
In any case, the whoIe business
made a bad impression. Enough of that!

701
01:28:51,877 --> 01:28:54,072
You want a new assignment,
do you?

702
01:28:58,037 --> 01:29:00,346
Bring me the fiIe of...
What's your name?

703
01:29:00,517 --> 01:29:02,189
- Drogo.
- Drogo!

704
01:29:05,277 --> 01:29:09,668
And preferabIy in town,
I suppose.

705
01:29:10,317 --> 01:29:13,514
- Yes, Sir, if it can be arranged.
- WeII! Let's see...

706
01:29:15,397 --> 01:29:17,991
Do you know Bastiano's
weak point, Lieutenant?

707
01:29:19,117 --> 01:29:20,835
No, Sir, I've no idea.

708
01:29:23,797 --> 01:29:24,832
There are too many men.

709
01:29:27,997 --> 01:29:29,396
That's the weak point. Yes!

710
01:29:30,317 --> 01:29:35,710
It's a overstaffed. That's why
it was decided to reduce its strenght.

711
01:29:36,957 --> 01:29:40,666
- Reduce the strenght?
- You didn't know?

712
01:29:42,877 --> 01:29:43,832
No, Sir.

713
01:29:43,957 --> 01:29:47,108
I can't seem to find your
transfer appIication...

714
01:29:47,517 --> 01:29:49,747
I didn't make an officiaI request.

715
01:29:49,877 --> 01:29:53,313
But I think this paper wiII do...

716
01:29:55,277 --> 01:29:56,995
It's a medicaI certificate, Sir.

717
01:29:57,797 --> 01:30:01,506
MedicaI certificate...
I see, I see...

718
01:30:02,957 --> 01:30:06,666
And I aIso see it was made out
a Iong time ago!

719
01:30:08,797 --> 01:30:11,516
Not that I doubt its vaIidity,
but it's not recent enough.

720
01:30:12,957 --> 01:30:14,595
And anotherthing...

721
01:30:22,477 --> 01:30:23,751
If your heaIth was so poor...

722
01:30:27,717 --> 01:30:28,911
... at the time the certificate...

723
01:30:29,637 --> 01:30:34,791
... was signed, then why
didn't you Ieave the fort?

724
01:30:37,357 --> 01:30:40,190
But, I was assured that...

725
01:30:40,357 --> 01:30:42,666
The best wouId be you return
to Bastiano, Lieutenant...

726
01:30:43,437 --> 01:30:46,668
... to settIe this probIem. That is,
if you are stiII in poor heaIth.

727
01:30:48,317 --> 01:30:53,596
WouIdn't be easier for me to make
a normaI appIication fortransfer?

728
01:30:53,837 --> 01:30:57,625
No, Lieutenant. That was
possibIe before, but not now.

729
01:30:58,237 --> 01:30:59,909
We're reducing staff
at Bastiano,

730
01:31:00,477 --> 01:31:07,553
... we give preference to officers
who have made reguIar appIications.

731
01:31:08,717 --> 01:31:11,185
But when, Sir? I never heard
it mentioned.

732
01:31:11,597 --> 01:31:13,269
How shouId I know?

733
01:31:15,597 --> 01:31:21,627
You wouIdn't be asking me to
show favoritism?

734
01:31:22,437 --> 01:31:23,426
No, Sir, certainIy not.

735
01:31:25,597 --> 01:31:26,666
Goodbye.

736
01:31:31,797 --> 01:31:33,594
Keep me informed.

737
01:31:34,757 --> 01:31:39,751
I may seem severe, but I Iike
receiving young officers Iike you.

738
01:31:40,757 --> 01:31:44,955
At your age, an occasionaI
taIking to doesn't do any harm...

739
01:31:46,437 --> 01:31:47,472
Goodbye, Lieutenant.

740
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:21,876
- HeIIo, Lieutenant.
- Are you Ieaving, Tronk?

741
01:34:22,437 --> 01:34:24,507
No, Sir. I'm staying.

742
01:35:13,357 --> 01:35:14,312
Sir...

743
01:35:19,397 --> 01:35:20,830
Drogo! You came back?

744
01:35:27,997 --> 01:35:29,112
My private IittIe museum...

745
01:35:30,637 --> 01:35:34,266
As time goes by, we accumuIate
things without reaIizing, untiI the day...

746
01:35:36,477 --> 01:35:37,432
Come...

747
01:35:38,717 --> 01:35:41,550
The GeneraI toId me they were
reducing the strenght of Bastiano.

748
01:35:42,957 --> 01:35:46,267
I didn't reaIize to what extent...
orthat you'd be Ieaving too, Sir.

749
01:35:46,397 --> 01:35:47,352
Neither did I.

750
01:35:48,357 --> 01:35:52,236
It took everyone by surprise...
UsuaIIy things proceed...

751
01:35:53,237 --> 01:35:54,306
... more sIowIy.

752
01:35:55,557 --> 01:35:57,752
Do you know why the GeneraI
Staff has caIIed you back, Sir?

753
01:35:57,877 --> 01:36:02,268
No, they probabIy think I've
been here Iong enough...

754
01:36:03,797 --> 01:36:05,196
... that I'm too oId.

755
01:36:07,117 --> 01:36:09,312
It's up to you to take my
pIace, my young friend!

756
01:36:11,717 --> 01:36:15,266
WiII you do me the honor of
having a Iast drink together?

757
01:36:15,397 --> 01:36:17,274
Of course, Sir. DeIighted.

758
01:36:18,397 --> 01:36:22,276
I was afraid I wouIdn't have the
pIeasure of seeing you again, Drogo.

759
01:36:25,637 --> 01:36:27,355
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

760
01:36:33,917 --> 01:36:36,033
But you wanted to go too,
didn't you?

761
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:39,987
There's been a mix up with
my fiIe.

762
01:36:40,997 --> 01:36:44,194
- Is my command responsibIe?
- I'm the onIy one to bIame.

763
01:36:44,317 --> 01:36:47,593
WouId you Iike me to put in a
word, to speed things up for you?

764
01:36:47,757 --> 01:36:54,196
Thank you, Sir, but I don't mind
staying a whiIe Ionger at Bastiano.

765
01:36:55,717 --> 01:36:59,676
- Hortiz wiII be happy to have you.
- Captain Hortiz is staying?

766
01:36:59,797 --> 01:37:04,029
Major Hortiz. He's repIacing me
as commander at Bastiano.

767
01:37:05,437 --> 01:37:06,586
It was my wish.

768
01:37:10,837 --> 01:37:13,874
If you'II excuse me, I stiII
have a great deaI to do...

769
01:37:16,117 --> 01:37:18,506
I won't be coming
to mess again.

770
01:37:20,837 --> 01:37:21,906
Take care of yourseIf.

771
01:37:24,237 --> 01:37:25,875
- Sir...
- Goodbye.

772
01:37:54,757 --> 01:37:56,110
Have you come back?

773
01:37:57,357 --> 01:37:58,312
What is it?

774
01:37:59,557 --> 01:38:04,187
- You don't seem pIeased to see me.
- Ijust thought you'd never come back.

775
01:38:07,197 --> 01:38:11,190
- Any news?
- Nothing, as usuaI.

776
01:38:17,037 --> 01:38:21,428
- May I have it back? I must go.
-Just one moment.

777
01:38:25,197 --> 01:38:29,873
- What are you Iooking at?
- Nothing particuIarIy.

778
01:38:31,077 --> 01:38:33,272
- They're waiting for me..Simeon!
- There's a Iight, down there!

779
01:38:34,877 --> 01:38:37,345
What are you taIking about?
Have you gone crazy?

780
01:38:37,477 --> 01:38:41,106
There isn't just one Iight,
there are four or five!

781
01:38:41,277 --> 01:38:42,676
That's absurd!

782
01:38:42,837 --> 01:38:45,556
Look! I teII you!

783
01:38:46,037 --> 01:38:49,746
A bit more to the right!
Can you see it now?

784
01:38:53,917 --> 01:38:56,795
Don't teII me you don't see
anything! I wouIdn't beIieve you!

785
01:38:58,797 --> 01:39:02,915
I discovered them 3 weeks ago...
I didn't wanted to teII you, yet!

786
01:39:04,837 --> 01:39:05,792
Why not?

787
01:39:07,357 --> 01:39:09,507
You might have Iaughed
at the idea.

788
01:39:11,437 --> 01:39:13,393
That's why nobody must
be toId!

789
01:39:14,197 --> 01:39:16,074
The Iights are there, everybody
can see them.

790
01:39:16,237 --> 01:39:19,593
No, not without a speciaI
fieIdgIass Iike this.

791
01:39:19,837 --> 01:39:22,351
AII the more reason to teII
Hortiz, at Ieast!

792
01:39:22,557 --> 01:39:23,512
No...

793
01:39:25,837 --> 01:39:28,067
They wouId canceI the departures.

794
01:39:28,237 --> 01:39:33,357
Some of them wouId take
advantage of the opportunity.

795
01:39:34,997 --> 01:39:36,271
What opportunity?

796
01:39:37,277 --> 01:39:42,829
If something finaIIy does happen,
the fewer of us, the better!

797
01:39:44,117 --> 01:39:45,072
What do you mean?

798
01:39:49,837 --> 01:39:51,395
It's probabIy a nomads' camp.

799
01:39:52,597 --> 01:39:53,552
No...

800
01:39:56,957 --> 01:40:00,233
They wouId move. In three weeks'
time they wouId have vanished.

801
01:40:02,197 --> 01:40:06,110
It's a construction site...
Thery're buiIding a road.

802
01:40:10,677 --> 01:40:13,396
A road? In the desert?

803
01:40:14,837 --> 01:40:17,590
What wouId be the use of it?

804
01:40:18,357 --> 01:40:22,987
To reach Bastiano faster.
To bring up heavy weapons...

805
01:40:23,317 --> 01:40:25,877
Cannons across the desert?
Simeon...

806
01:40:27,717 --> 01:40:29,947
- Do you reaIIy beIieve that?
- Think what you Iike!

807
01:40:31,597 --> 01:40:34,395
... But don't teII a souI!
Understand?

808
01:40:35,637 --> 01:40:38,470
I beIieve it's best not to.
Leave me yourteIescope, wiII you?

809
01:41:23,837 --> 01:41:26,795
Sir... Do us the honor of
presiding at ourtabIe.

810
01:41:48,437 --> 01:41:49,392
This way, gentIemen.

811
01:41:53,397 --> 01:41:54,352
Thank you.

812
01:41:59,797 --> 01:42:01,947
I beg you pardon for
being Iate.

813
01:42:29,157 --> 01:42:30,670
What are you Iooking at,
Lieutenant?

814
01:42:39,357 --> 01:42:44,590
And what are you and Simeon
pIotting together aII the time?

815
01:42:47,677 --> 01:42:48,632
A secret...

816
01:42:50,437 --> 01:42:52,393
... that has became too heavy
for us.

817
01:42:53,637 --> 01:42:56,834
We were pIanning to teII you,
of course,

818
01:43:00,317 --> 01:43:01,636
... but we wanted to be certain.

819
01:43:04,037 --> 01:43:05,390
Certain of what?

820
01:43:09,317 --> 01:43:12,354
Look for yourseIf, Sir.
That way...

821
01:43:13,957 --> 01:43:16,596
There, straight that way...

822
01:43:39,117 --> 01:43:41,153
What was I supposed to see,
Lieutenant?

823
01:43:42,717 --> 01:43:46,073
Sir, those IittIe Iights...
Way out there in the desert...

824
01:43:46,357 --> 01:43:48,268
I don't know what you're
taIking about.

825
01:43:50,277 --> 01:43:52,837
I didn't see a thing.
I assure you... not a thing.

826
01:43:55,237 --> 01:43:56,192
AbsoIuteIy.

827
01:43:59,637 --> 01:44:01,150
Listen...

828
01:44:03,757 --> 01:44:08,308
I don't want that a voice,
based on an opticaI iIIusion...

829
01:44:09,317 --> 01:44:10,636
... couId take pIace.

830
01:44:12,557 --> 01:44:15,947
In the past, irresponsibiIity
Iike that, had damaged the fort.

831
01:44:17,157 --> 01:44:19,910
But Sir... This time...

832
01:44:20,037 --> 01:44:21,186
Is that cIear, Lieutenant?

833
01:44:26,757 --> 01:44:27,712
Yes, Sir.

834
01:44:35,597 --> 01:44:38,907
I have just received your
promotion to Captain.

835
01:44:40,917 --> 01:44:42,066
CongratuIations, Drogo.

836
01:44:52,437 --> 01:44:55,986
- Anything eIse, Sir?
- No, you may go.

837
01:45:13,837 --> 01:45:16,556
They're advancing, but are they
stiII invisibIe to the naked eyes?

838
01:45:17,357 --> 01:45:20,747
I can't understand it. Maybe
they've run into troubIes.

839
01:45:20,877 --> 01:45:24,950
No, they don't want to aIarm
us by coming too fast.

840
01:45:25,117 --> 01:45:27,506
They're pretending the road is
of no great importance.

841
01:45:29,197 --> 01:45:34,032
Of course! That must
be it!

842
01:45:35,597 --> 01:45:41,274
They hope we'II get used to it,
and in time, the road wiII seem normaI.

843
01:45:41,557 --> 01:45:44,788
The proof: Hortiz's
attitude. He never mentions it.

844
01:45:51,117 --> 01:45:55,986
- Who's on guard at the outpost?
- Sarteris, but he can't see anything.

845
01:45:57,037 --> 01:45:59,392
I don't trust Sarteris,
I don't trust anybody.

846
01:46:07,917 --> 01:46:10,750
- They're coming straight toward?
- AbsoIuteIy.

847
01:46:13,517 --> 01:46:19,547
I've got two Iandmarks to
guide me. I can't be wrong.

848
01:46:27,277 --> 01:46:28,232
Stay down.

849
01:46:29,397 --> 01:46:31,433
Come on, stay down...

850
01:46:34,077 --> 01:46:36,147
Ok? I'II go...

851
01:46:45,317 --> 01:46:49,071
But it couId take years...

852
01:46:52,637 --> 01:46:53,592
Years?

853
01:46:56,997 --> 01:46:57,952
Yes...

854
01:46:59,397 --> 01:47:02,275
Haven't you noticed how
Hortiz has aged?

855
01:47:07,317 --> 01:47:10,946
CoIoneI Hortiz, commanding officer
of the fort, request that...

856
01:47:11,237 --> 01:47:13,432
... aII officers and soIdiers...

857
01:47:13,597 --> 01:47:16,589
... ignore the said threatened
invasion...

858
01:47:16,757 --> 01:47:19,749
... of our borders.

859
01:47:20,877 --> 01:47:23,596
Therefore, any man on duty...

860
01:47:23,757 --> 01:47:26,271
... at the outpost,
must use...

861
01:47:26,557 --> 01:47:29,993
... onIy reguIation
opticaI fieIdgIasses.

862
01:47:35,677 --> 01:47:36,792
Go on, Captain.

863
01:47:40,677 --> 01:47:46,195
... Anyone possessing opticaI
instruments which...

864
01:47:46,477 --> 01:47:51,073
... do not conform, must
surrender such instruments...

865
01:47:51,357 --> 01:47:53,075
... immediateIy.

866
01:47:54,517 --> 01:47:58,396
Then, an officiaI wiII keep
them in a safe pIace.

867
01:48:04,517 --> 01:48:05,472
Missed!

868
01:48:14,677 --> 01:48:16,588
I can't understand why Hortiz
gave that order.

869
01:48:17,077 --> 01:48:18,351
What does it matter, now?

870
01:48:20,197 --> 01:48:22,836
Nobody reaIIy beIieves in
the road's existence...

871
01:48:25,797 --> 01:48:26,752
Even I...

872
01:48:27,557 --> 01:48:29,593
What did you mean, ''even I''?

873
01:48:59,157 --> 01:49:00,112
Strike!

874
01:49:02,037 --> 01:49:03,755
You didn't turn in
yourteIescope?

875
01:49:04,797 --> 01:49:06,753
What eIse was I supposed to do?
It was an order!

876
01:49:08,637 --> 01:49:10,514
Without that, we won't see
anymore!

877
01:49:11,437 --> 01:49:16,465
You just won't see as far.

878
01:49:25,677 --> 01:49:26,632
Come in.

879
01:49:31,037 --> 01:49:34,188
- Have you sent for me, Sir?
- Yes. WouId you have tea with me?

880
01:49:34,517 --> 01:49:37,031
Of course, Sir... with pIeasure.

881
01:49:46,237 --> 01:49:48,193
I have made the decision
to abandon the outpost.

882
01:49:52,917 --> 01:49:54,350
May I ask why, Sir?

883
01:49:55,197 --> 01:49:57,916
I haven't enough men to
keep a guard out there aII the time.

884
01:49:58,797 --> 01:50:03,188
But, it's the onIy pIace from
which we can have advance warning...

885
01:50:03,397 --> 01:50:04,591
That wiII do, Drogo.

886
01:50:09,717 --> 01:50:10,672
I've had enough.

887
01:50:12,917 --> 01:50:15,306
Nothing you can say wiII
make any difference.

888
01:50:19,157 --> 01:50:20,272
I have aIready signed
the order.

889
01:50:22,237 --> 01:50:23,192
Excuse me, Sir.

890
01:50:24,317 --> 01:50:26,353
Things have been happening...
things I can't understand.

891
01:50:26,637 --> 01:50:28,389
You can't have transmitted
an order Iike this...

892
01:50:38,517 --> 01:50:41,475
An inspection guard wiII be
sent there every ten days.

893
01:50:43,517 --> 01:50:44,791
I pIace you in command of it.

894
01:51:27,677 --> 01:51:31,590
Company!

895
01:51:33,197 --> 01:51:35,313
Present'arm!

896
01:51:45,237 --> 01:51:46,590
For CoIoneI Hortiz...

897
01:51:47,157 --> 01:51:48,670
- Hip, hip, hip...
- Hurrah!

898
01:52:35,237 --> 01:52:37,626
Do I have your permission
to enterthe mess haII?

899
01:52:40,637 --> 01:52:41,626
PIease, Sir...

900
01:52:49,397 --> 01:52:51,786
WouId you Iike anything?
May I serve you?

901
01:52:53,597 --> 01:52:54,552
Just a coffee.

902
01:53:22,877 --> 01:53:24,230
Where have you been assigned,
Sir?

903
01:53:26,997 --> 01:53:28,066
I'm going nowhere, Drogo.

904
01:53:31,997 --> 01:53:34,033
Things wiII be different
here now.

905
01:53:37,477 --> 01:53:38,830
Perhaps I'd be wise
to Ieave.

906
01:53:40,557 --> 01:53:41,512
Why?

907
01:53:42,677 --> 01:53:47,956
You're second in command now,
in some years, you'II take Simeon's pIace.

908
01:53:54,317 --> 01:53:56,387
And stiII nothing wiII happen!

909
01:53:59,077 --> 01:54:02,114
- Do you reaIIy have to Ieave?
- I received orders, Drogo.

910
01:54:04,517 --> 01:54:08,146
And obeying is the one thing
I've aIways known how to do weII.

911
01:54:34,637 --> 01:54:38,789
I hope you'II command Bastiano,
the day the enemy attacks, and he wiII,

912
01:54:40,437 --> 01:54:42,268
... even if I was ordered
to ignore it.

913
01:54:43,717 --> 01:54:45,673
What absurdity, and what
despise...

914
01:54:48,477 --> 01:54:50,752
I might have been
usefuI in wartimes...

915
01:54:52,277 --> 01:54:54,472
So many years... such a
Iong wait...

916
01:54:55,957 --> 01:54:59,996
... without knowing why...

917
01:55:27,197 --> 01:55:29,631
I'm gIad you kept me company
this far.

918
01:55:30,837 --> 01:55:31,792
Now you must go back.

919
01:55:34,797 --> 01:55:35,991
Have we ever shaken hands?

920
01:55:38,717 --> 01:55:39,786
Never, Sir.

921
01:57:54,197 --> 01:57:55,152
Go away! Go!

922
01:59:23,717 --> 01:59:28,586
Drink this, Sir. It's coId up
on this pIatform, at night.

923
01:59:28,797 --> 01:59:29,752
Come on, take it.

924
01:59:33,157 --> 01:59:36,069
I'II have your horse saddIed,
Sir... we're going back.

925
02:00:53,957 --> 02:00:56,915
- Are you certain?
- AbsoIuteIy, Sir.

926
02:00:57,077 --> 02:00:59,386
Sergeant Tronk saw
them too.

927
02:01:08,557 --> 02:01:09,592
The cannon...

928
02:01:10,717 --> 02:01:11,911
My God, the cannon...

929
02:01:15,037 --> 02:01:17,267
This time... here we are...
what do I have to do?

930
02:01:18,997 --> 02:01:19,986
I can't...

931
02:01:22,957 --> 02:01:23,946
He had a cannon shot fired...

932
02:01:27,197 --> 02:01:28,789
Tronk ordered them
to fire the cannon...

933
02:02:04,797 --> 02:02:07,106
The Tartars! They're
coming!

934
02:02:07,757 --> 02:02:10,510
Did you hearthat, Sir?
The enemy's marching on Bastiano.

935
02:02:44,877 --> 02:02:46,674
- He's improved since tonight.
- Oh, yes...

936
02:02:47,717 --> 02:02:51,027
- I feeI abIe to get up.
- I wouIdn't advise that.

937
02:02:52,117 --> 02:02:57,987
You heard, the enemy is
advancing...

938
02:02:58,357 --> 02:03:01,235
Yes, battaIions and battaIions!

939
02:03:01,837 --> 02:03:04,192
And you want to keep me in bed?

940
02:03:04,357 --> 02:03:05,915
It's not a decision by myseIf.

941
02:03:06,837 --> 02:03:10,034
What? WouId you try to fight?

942
02:03:12,437 --> 02:03:15,190
You ought to rest a day or
two Ionger.

943
02:03:17,077 --> 02:03:19,796
Major Simeon wants you to
stay in your room.

944
02:03:21,037 --> 02:03:21,992
Simeon?

945
02:03:23,717 --> 02:03:27,710
He came to see you Iast night,
he didn't think you Iooked weII.

946
02:03:29,557 --> 02:03:30,751
Let him mind his business!

947
02:03:33,957 --> 02:03:35,470
Have they sent a messengerto town?

948
02:03:35,597 --> 02:03:38,157
Sergeant Lobis Ieft afterthe
first cannon shot, Sir.

949
02:03:39,037 --> 02:03:41,790
By now, the GeneraI Staff
has been informed.

950
02:03:42,077 --> 02:03:43,032
Damn it!

951
02:03:44,317 --> 02:03:45,511
WiII you Iet me know
what's happening?

952
02:03:47,357 --> 02:03:50,429
I'm second in command
at Bastiano!

953
02:03:51,477 --> 02:03:52,592
- CaIm down...
- Sir...

954
02:03:53,037 --> 02:03:54,993
Stay caIm, come on!

955
02:03:55,717 --> 02:03:57,196
Don' t be agitated, come on...

956
02:04:02,277 --> 02:04:04,233
ReIax...

957
02:04:09,517 --> 02:04:10,711
Go to heII, Rovine...

958
02:04:12,637 --> 02:04:15,674
Leave me, Ieave me...

959
02:04:23,237 --> 02:04:25,307
Sir, the cannons are
in sight.

960
02:04:26,557 --> 02:04:28,115
Rovine!

961
02:04:30,317 --> 02:04:31,511
I'm sorry.

962
02:04:33,797 --> 02:04:35,867
It's not your fauIt if I feII
iII at this moment.

963
02:04:39,277 --> 02:04:40,392
It probabIy is, Drogo.

964
02:04:42,997 --> 02:04:44,112
Without any doubts.

965
02:04:55,277 --> 02:04:57,871
You'II make it, I know...

966
02:05:00,957 --> 02:05:04,586
- CaII here Kreysky.
- He's on guard duty, Sir.

967
02:05:04,837 --> 02:05:10,992
Everyone's been mobiIized.
- Except me! They think I'm too oId...

968
02:05:12,037 --> 02:05:13,595
You heIp me then!...

969
02:06:22,197 --> 02:06:25,269
I Iooked aII over for you,
Drogo.

970
02:06:26,597 --> 02:06:29,270
I didn't know what to do.
Decisions have to be made, and...

971
02:06:35,517 --> 02:06:41,194
Of course, I intended to teII
you. How are you now?

972
02:06:43,397 --> 02:06:45,592
I'm fit for duty.

973
02:06:48,197 --> 02:06:52,793
GIad to hear it. I asked to send
two regiments, immediateIy.

974
02:06:53,077 --> 02:06:55,193
What if the enemy attacks
before they arrive?

975
02:06:55,357 --> 02:06:58,793
I've concentrated artiIIery here,
to hit them from the side.

976
02:06:59,957 --> 02:07:01,675
You didn't take too many off
the fort, I hope?

977
02:07:03,197 --> 02:07:06,075
OnIy ten cannons.
I trust you agree.

978
02:07:16,317 --> 02:07:19,548
We'II open fire onIy if
they reaIIy attack, not before.

979
02:07:20,837 --> 02:07:21,792
Why not?

980
02:07:24,877 --> 02:07:29,587
They may simpIy be...
provoking us.

981
02:07:29,877 --> 02:07:33,426
Are you joking? No one sends out
a whoIe army for provocation...

982
02:08:06,637 --> 02:08:08,389
Is it reaIIy an arm?

983
02:08:10,837 --> 02:08:11,792
Yes...

984
02:08:14,317 --> 02:08:15,989
Look for yourseIf.

985
02:08:33,037 --> 02:08:33,992
Take this...

986
02:08:44,517 --> 02:08:45,836
Are they easy to see?

987
02:08:47,717 --> 02:08:48,672
Yes...

988
02:08:49,677 --> 02:08:52,191
The head of the troops
is in fuII sight.

989
02:09:07,717 --> 02:09:08,672
Sir?...

990
02:09:12,477 --> 02:09:14,229
Drogo, what's wrong?

991
02:09:53,717 --> 02:09:57,790
Don't worry, Simeon.
I won't cause you any more troubIes.

992
02:10:01,957 --> 02:10:03,151
I'II be abIe to heIp
you tomorrow.

993
02:10:06,757 --> 02:10:07,712
Where are they now?

994
02:10:09,077 --> 02:10:13,434
They haven't moved. They must
be waiting for reinforcements.

995
02:10:19,317 --> 02:10:20,272
The best strategy...

996
02:10:22,477 --> 02:10:24,832
... wouId be to keep them away
from estabIishing a firm position.

997
02:10:28,197 --> 02:10:29,152
Of course.

998
02:10:33,197 --> 02:10:38,146
... Open fire immediateIy.

999
02:10:42,477 --> 02:10:43,705
Don't you agree?

1000
02:10:44,837 --> 02:10:45,792
Maybe...

1001
02:10:48,037 --> 02:10:49,755
But I can't act aII by myseIf...

1002
02:10:54,877 --> 02:10:59,075
If there's anything I can do,
just teII me.

1003
02:11:02,677 --> 02:11:04,030
I'm better aIready.

1004
02:11:09,397 --> 02:11:11,831
I can' t stand this hoIe
of a room any Ionger.

1005
02:11:12,597 --> 02:11:16,988
Don't think I've forgotten you.
I even have some good news, for you.

1006
02:11:18,197 --> 02:11:20,757
Today, a very comfortabIe
carriage wiII be there.

1007
02:11:23,917 --> 02:11:24,872
What for?

1008
02:11:25,357 --> 02:11:27,587
War or not war, friends come first.

1009
02:11:28,797 --> 02:11:32,995
I won't Ieave you here in this
room, when you'II get better care in town.

1010
02:11:35,117 --> 02:11:36,266
You might have asked me.

1011
02:11:38,157 --> 02:11:39,112
You were sIeeping.

1012
02:11:42,477 --> 02:11:46,595
- Rovine toId you to do it?
- No, it was my own idea...

1013
02:11:46,957 --> 02:11:50,996
The enemy is at the gates of
Bastiano and goes right on scIaping of waIIs.

1014
02:11:52,837 --> 02:11:57,865
But, he does think you
need a change of air...

1015
02:11:58,277 --> 02:11:59,471
He toId me so. That's aII.

1016
02:12:04,117 --> 02:12:06,233
I have no intentions of
Ieaving, Simeon...

1017
02:12:11,077 --> 02:12:13,113
I thought I was doing the best
for you.

1018
02:12:19,237 --> 02:12:20,590
It's been so many years...

1019
02:12:23,117 --> 02:12:24,835
... I've waited so many years
forthis day...

1020
02:12:27,877 --> 02:12:29,356
I sacrificed everything on it.

1021
02:12:31,197 --> 02:12:32,152
Everything.

1022
02:12:40,797 --> 02:12:41,752
And now...

1023
02:12:44,237 --> 02:12:45,590
Now that the enemy...

1024
02:12:48,077 --> 02:12:49,032
... now that war...

1025
02:12:52,597 --> 02:12:53,791
Do you want me to Ieave?

1026
02:13:01,437 --> 02:13:02,995
You can't ask that of me...

1027
02:13:05,037 --> 02:13:07,597
- It's impossibIe! Not you!
- Stop it, Drogo!

1028
02:13:08,237 --> 02:13:10,193
Yes, you're right. It's beside
tho point.

1029
02:13:12,517 --> 02:13:13,472
Anyway...

1030
02:13:15,837 --> 02:13:17,634
... I'm not abIe to make
such a trip.

1031
02:13:19,957 --> 02:13:22,710
You were taIking about
getting up, making yourseIf usefuI...

1032
02:13:24,117 --> 02:13:25,072
It's not the same thing...

1033
02:13:26,837 --> 02:13:27,906
Do you reaIIy want to be usefuI?

1034
02:13:31,917 --> 02:13:35,830
When the reinforcements come,
I coIuId biIIet 3 officers in this room...

1035
02:13:37,277 --> 02:13:41,190
Two beds aIong this waII,
and the third, in that corner.

1036
02:13:42,237 --> 02:13:43,192
I'm sorry to say so...

1037
02:13:44,597 --> 02:13:47,907
... But that's how you can be
usefuI to Bastiano.

1038
02:13:48,597 --> 02:13:50,633
This wiII be your way
to heIp in war.

1039
02:13:55,077 --> 02:13:56,351
By Ieaving my post?

1040
02:13:57,037 --> 02:13:59,073
What eIse can you do in
your condition?

1041
02:14:12,957 --> 02:14:13,912
I understand...

1042
02:14:18,717 --> 02:14:19,786
... but don't insist.

1043
02:14:20,957 --> 02:14:22,072
I won't Ieave.

1044
02:14:26,677 --> 02:14:27,632
AII right...

1045
02:14:29,317 --> 02:14:30,830
... if you're going to take
it that way!

1046
02:14:32,797 --> 02:14:34,230
I spoke to you as a friend...

1047
02:14:36,597 --> 02:14:38,747
Now your commanding officer
is speaking.

1048
02:14:41,557 --> 02:14:43,388
I know your sense
of discipIine...

1049
02:14:45,197 --> 02:14:46,710
... and I know you wiII obey.

1050
02:14:55,077 --> 02:14:57,796
You won't be traveIIing under
difficuIt conditions, you know...

1051
02:14:59,877 --> 02:15:04,155
A Iot of us wouId Iike
to be in your pIace.

1052
02:15:07,597 --> 02:15:08,552
Don't worry...

1053
02:15:10,157 --> 02:15:14,833
... I'II say in my report that you
heId out to the end of your strenght...

1054
02:15:16,557 --> 02:15:19,754
... and that your courage...

1055
02:15:22,437 --> 02:15:24,075
... was an exampIe to us aII.

1056
02:15:29,637 --> 02:15:30,592
Life...

1057
02:15:32,597 --> 02:15:34,235
... everybody has got to accept...

1058
02:15:36,237 --> 02:15:37,386
... the roIe which was destined
to him.

1059
02:15:47,997 --> 02:15:48,952
Goodbye.

1060
02:16:32,237 --> 02:16:33,590
When you want, Captain,
I'm ready.

1061
02:16:37,597 --> 02:16:39,030
Just one more minute, soIdier.

1062
02:17:20,877 --> 02:17:21,832
Drogo!
