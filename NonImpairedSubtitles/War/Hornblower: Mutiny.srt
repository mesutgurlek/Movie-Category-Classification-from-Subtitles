1
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,860
Fire!

2
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:15,777
Sir Edward Pellew himself to
see you, sir.

3
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,180
-Very well, you can leave us.
-Your Honour...

4
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:25,885
-I shall have to lock you in.
-Then do it!

5
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,760
That it should come to this...

6
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:41,060
...you of all people.

7
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:44,079
It's good of you to come
and see me, sir.

8
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,641
This is not a social call, man!
Good God, sir! In a few hours-

9
00:02:48,642 --> 00:02:51,340
you'll be on trial for your life,

10
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:55,282
and unless there are extenuating
circumstances, you'll hang.

11
00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:58,200
-Hang in front of the entire squadron
-I believe it was-

12
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:01,205
our duty to restore order and
discipline aboard ship, sir.

13
00:03:01,206 --> 00:03:05,701
Order and discipline.
Black, bloody mutiny, sir.

14
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,348
That's what the charge is.

15
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,870
and against a captain who was a hero
of the Nile and-

16
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:16,299
the Battle of Cape St. Vincent.

17
00:03:16,499 --> 00:03:20,380
One of Nelson's own...
Dear God!

18
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,972
It was for the good of
the Service, sir.

19
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:29,400
Hero or not, we were headed
for disaster.

20
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:35,889
The English Channel
Six months earlier.

21
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:16,855
We're carrying too much sail, Archie.

22
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,815
Mr. Buckland, we should take
another reef.

23
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,500
You're the officer of
the watch, Mr. Hornblower.

24
00:04:23,801 --> 00:04:26,200
It's your decision.

25
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,300
If this keeps up we'll be aloft
before long, I'll warrant ya.

26
00:04:33,301 --> 00:04:35,900
-That'll sort out the men from
the boys.
-Oh, God!

27
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,500
Don't worry, Kid. Stick with me,
you'll grow up as bitter-

28
00:04:38,501 --> 00:04:40,701
-as the rest of us.
-Mr. Wellard,

29
00:04:40,802 --> 00:04:43,900
my respects to Captain Sawyer.
Please inform him-

30
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:46,561
-we are about to shorten sail.
-Aye, aye, sir.

31
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,487
Matthews, hands aloft to double
reef that mail tops'l.

32
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,163
Told ya.  Come on, lads.
Come on, Randall.

33
00:05:00,482 --> 00:05:03,148
Come on, you little runt,
get up there.

34
00:05:13,700 --> 00:05:15,740
Come.

35
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,060
What brings you to interrupt
my fruit, Mr. Wellard?

36
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:29,260
-Captain Sawyer, sir…
-Come on, boy.  We won't eat you.

37
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:31,800
I don't believe Dr. Clive and
I have enough room left-

38
00:05:31,801 --> 00:05:35,000
-for a young midshipman.
-'Couldn't manage another thing.

39
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,700
Mr. Hornblower sends his respects,
sir, and-

40
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:40,119
to inform you he's shortening sail.

41
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,260
-Watch what you're doing, Styles.
-Just watch yourself,Randall.

42
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:50,938
Keep your little friend out
of my way.

43
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,580
Where do you think you're going?

44
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,000
Captain Sawyer, sir, I've
ordered another reef in-

45
00:06:01,001 --> 00:06:04,518
-the main tops'l, sir.
-So I hear, Mr. Hornblower.

46
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,101
-Your decision alone?
-Indeed, sir.

47
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:11,140
Mr. Buckland, you're
the first lieutenant.

48
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:14,500
Do my standing orders require
the officer of the watch-

49
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:17,997
to inform me before
shortening sail, or not?

50
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:21,540
"Sir"?  What kind of answer is that?
Do they or do they not?

51
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,940
Yes, sir; they do, sir.

52
00:06:23,941 --> 00:06:26,740
-Mr. Hornblower?
-With respect, sir;

53
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:30,040
your orders require us to inform
you when shortening sail, sir.

54
00:06:30,041 --> 00:06:33,023
Don't come the sea lawyer
with me, sir.

55
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,015
Ahoy, there!  Gunner, Mr. Hobbs!

56
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,940
Have you ever had difficulty
interpreting my orders?

57
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:45,000
-Indeed I have not, sir.
-There you are, then.

58
00:06:45,001 --> 00:06:47,377
A gunner has no trouble
understanding my orders,

59
00:06:47,378 --> 00:06:49,319
what do you say to that,
Mr. Hornblower?

60
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,600
My apologies, sir; I must
have misunderstood.

61
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:58,420
The excellent men of your
own division, are they not?

62
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:02,270
Perhaps by teaching them a lesson,

63
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:04,499
you'll learn something of your own.

64
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,310
But sir, it was I who made
the mistake.

65
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,760
Get to it, you lubbers!

66
00:07:10,761 --> 00:07:13,971
The last man off the yardarm
gets a flogging.

67
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:17,788
A dozen at the gratings for
the last man on deck.

68
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,400
Out 'my way, Laddie.

69
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,060
Come here, boy!

70
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,660
Pass the word for the doctor!

71
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,000
He's dead, sir.

72
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,960
-Well?!  Well?!
-He's dead!

73
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,490
Dr. Clive will be the judge of that.
Doctor?

74
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,260
Dead, sir.

75
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,350
What are you waiting for,
Mr. Hornblower?

76
00:07:54,351 --> 00:07:56,760
Have the lubber thrown over the side.

77
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:59,707
Do you hear, Mr. Hornblower?

78
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,200
For God sake, Horatio.

79
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:07,540
The lad's dead, sir.

80
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,400
Nothin'll bring him back.
Is that right, Mr. Kennedy?

81
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:13,937
-Yes, Styles, that's right.
-We can read over him later, sir.

82
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,215
Mr. Hornblower, get that man
off my quarterdeck.

83
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,060
Aye, aye, sir.

84
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,960
Plymouth Sound.

85
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,197
Stow those barrels forward
on the gun deck.

86
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:31,456
'Morning.
Bush, second lieutenant.

87
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,060
-Look out, there!
-Look out.

88
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,890
Hornblower, third lieutenant.

89
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:44,360
An interesting welcoming ceremony,
Mr. Hornblower.

90
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:47,326
My apologies, Mr. Bush.
Are you quite all right?

91
00:09:47,327 --> 00:09:49,760
Nothing damaged but my pride,
I think.

92
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:52,050
Hey there, you at the stay tackles!
Mind what you're doing!

93
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:55,767
-Mr. Hobbs, keep an eye on
your men, there.
-Aye, aye, sir.

94
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,080
Mr. Hobbs, lay aft here.

95
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,300
Mr. Hobbs, your recklessness nearly
injured one of the ships-

96
00:10:08,301 --> 00:10:11,660
senior officers; not to mention
damaging vital supplies.

97
00:10:11,661 --> 00:10:14,814
Don't use that tone of voice
when replying to an order.

98
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,500
Aye, aye, sir.

99
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,520
Perhaps if the men were better
supervised, these accidents-

100
00:10:20,521 --> 00:10:22,860
wouldn't happen, Mr. Hornblower.

101
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,547
Captain's coming off, sir!

102
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,732
Quite right.
Run for'ard and tell Mr. Buckland.

103
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,320
Boswain's mates, sideboys,
lively now!

104
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,049
Marine guard, present arms!

105
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,915
Shoulder...arms!

106
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,260
-Lieutenant Bush come aboard,sir
-You came in my absense,did you?

107
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,760
-I did, sir.
-Did you report to the
first lieutenant?

108
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:12,015
-No,sir
-In my absense,you should have
reported to Mr. Buckland.

109
00:11:12,016 --> 00:11:15,561
Mr. Buckland, why did Mr. Bush
not report to you?

110
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,360
I'm very sorry,sir. I was unaware
that Mr.Bush had come aboard.

111
00:11:19,364 --> 00:11:21,800
He should have made himself
known, sir.

112
00:11:21,801 --> 00:11:24,560
I was forward, inspecting
the anchor cables.

113
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:27,499
-Mr. Bush?
-I arrived only a few minutes
before you, sir.

114
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,750
I wished to present myself
personally.

115
00:11:29,751 --> 00:11:31,800
And may I say, sir, what an honour
it is to serve-

116
00:11:31,801 --> 00:11:33,899
under a captain with so
distinguished a record?

117
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:36,110
-Well, Mr. Bush, you are welcome.
-Thank-you, sir.

118
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:39,512
In time, you may indeed thank me.
Very well.

119
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,260
You don't know Captain Sawyer, then?

120
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,860
I know his reputation.

121
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,972
As a fighting captain, or as a man?

122
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,460
-What are you implying, Mr…?
-Kennedy, sir; fourth lieutenant.

123
00:11:57,461 --> 00:12:00,078
Well, Mr.Kennedy, I don't think
I much care for your tone, sir.

124
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:02,800
Mr. Kennedy was merely
making conversation,

125
00:12:02,801 --> 00:12:05,350
weren't you, Mr. Kennedy?

126
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,841
-Now, let me show you the wardroom.
-Very good of you.

127
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:19,360
I don't think I much care
for your tone, sir.

128
00:12:19,461 --> 00:12:22,481
What an honour to serve under
a captain with such a record,sir.

129
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,904
That's enough, Mr. Wellard.

130
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,900
Now, get below and find out what
that hullabaloo is all about,

131
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:30,701
before it brings the captain
down on us again.

132
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,462
Yeah, I pushed the little devil
off the yardarm. Who cares?

133
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,954
Silence!!  Do you hear me?

134
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,560
Silence!

135
00:12:55,437 --> 00:12:57,520
Mr. Matthews, you're the boatswain.
Will you-

136
00:12:57,521 --> 00:12:59,800
get them to stop
this blinkin' racket?

137
00:12:59,801 --> 00:13:02,600
Silence!

138
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,630
Right.  What's going on here?
You, Randall, what's all this?

139
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:10,760
Just settling a little difference
of opinion, you might say.

140
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:13,181
Captain Sawyer loves a little bit of
bare knuckle between-

141
00:13:13,182 --> 00:13:15,960
the men. It keeps them ready
for the real thing, he says

142
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:18,114
Come on, Mr. Matthews, get them
to break this up.

143
00:13:18,115 --> 00:13:20,385
Aye, aye, Mr. Wellard.
Come on now.

144
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,800
Hold hard there, Mr. Matthews.
This hasn't been settled, yet.

145
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:25,900
The captain wouldn't like it if he
knew we were interfering-

146
00:13:25,901 --> 00:13:27,930
-with the men's sport,would he?
-The captain doesn't need-

147
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:31,349
-to know does he,Mr.Hobbs?
-Yeah, not unless some little toady…

148
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,071
-Randall, break it up, now.
-Make me, little boy.

149
00:13:35,072 --> 00:13:38,466
Sir!  Randall, you call him sir!

150
00:13:38,467 --> 00:13:41,860
Any man, any man, Mr. Hobbs, who
thinks differently had better

151
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:45,460
remember the punishment for
disobeying a superior officer.

152
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,060
-Tell them, Matthews.
-Death, sir.

153
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,900
Indeed, death.

154
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,552
And best you all remember it.

155
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,412
Get the ship underway,
if you please, Mr. Buckland.

156
00:14:11,413 --> 00:14:15,090
Aye, aye, sir.
Loose the heads'ls!

157
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,458
Hands aloft to loose the tops'ls!

158
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,760
-Carry on, Mr. Bush.
-Heave!

159
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,180
Heave!

160
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:31,081
Put your backs into it!

161
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:04,196
-Mr. Hornblower.
-Sir.

162
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,499
Set a course to weather The Lizard
and then southwest, sir.

163
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:10,266
Weather The Lizard and
southwest, it is, sir.

164
00:15:10,267 --> 00:15:12,867
South by west a quarter west.

165
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,560
Well, gentlemen,...

166
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,519
it's the West Indies
for us.  Santo Domingo.

167
00:15:25,525 --> 00:15:27,860
The blacks are in rebellion there.

168
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,050
Very good Mr.Hornblower,very good.
Gentlemen, we can certainly-

169
00:15:32,051 --> 00:15:36,900
rely on Mr. Hornblower to keep us
abreast of current events.

170
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,283
Yes, a slave rebellion.
They're uprising-

171
00:15:40,284 --> 00:15:43,460
against their Spanish masters,
started by that darned

172
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,060
dangerous French revolutionary
nonsense.

173
00:15:46,061 --> 00:15:48,497
Liberty, fraternity, stupidity.

174
00:15:48,598 --> 00:15:51,137
You're not a revolutionary,
are you, Mr. Hornblower?

175
00:15:51,138 --> 00:15:53,367
-Indeed I am not, sir.
-No.

176
00:15:53,368 --> 00:15:57,473
We know how to deal with them
in His Majesty's ships, don't we?

177
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:02,267
Santo Domingo, gentlemen.There is
a nest of Spanish privateers-

178
00:16:02,268 --> 00:16:05,399
right here in Samana Bay menacing
our trade-

179
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,625
through the Mona Strait. It's
our task to clear the vermin out.

180
00:16:09,626 --> 00:16:12,052
It's a far cry from Napoleon,
sir, but we've ten times-

181
00:16:12,053 --> 00:16:14,767
more chance of action than
with the Channel Fleet.

182
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,228
That so, Mr. Bush?

183
00:16:20,390 --> 00:16:22,329
That's so.

184
00:16:22,330 --> 00:16:25,860
Now there's a man after my own heart.

185
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:29,474
And plenty of action you shall have,
Mr. Bush; along with-

186
00:16:29,475 --> 00:16:32,419
an abundance of yellow fever
and ague, eh, Dr. Clive?

187
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:34,815
Putrid fever and poisonous
serpents, sir.

188
00:16:34,816 --> 00:16:38,921
-Tropical heat, bad water.
-Hurricanes and shipworm.

189
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:44,160
When were you last in the West
Indies, Mr. Buckland?

190
00:16:44,161 --> 00:16:46,263
-Sir?
-Answer the question. When were you-

191
00:16:46,264 --> 00:16:48,750
-in the West Indies, Mr. Buckland?
-I regret to say…

192
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:51,437
Never, you were never in the
West Indies. That's when you were-

193
00:16:51,438 --> 00:16:54,037
in the West Indies, Mr. Buckland.

194
00:16:54,923 --> 00:16:57,592
"Hurricanes and shipworm."

195
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,925
Not a day's sail from Plymouth
and you're out-

196
00:16:59,926 --> 00:17:02,564
of your depth already.

197
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:06,020
Am I not right, Mr. Bush?

198
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:11,060
I said, "Isn't that right?"

199
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,578
Sir, I protest.

200
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,662
We all have much to learn, sir,
from your example.

201
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:30,370
Quite right, Dr. Clive.

202
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:36,860
"Hurricanes and ship worm."

203
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,280
Gentlemen.

204
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,460
Then how would you describe
such unsound behaviour?

205
00:18:01,461 --> 00:18:04,219
-Captain Sawyer's just weary, Archie.
-Weary?

206
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:06,290
The man's bedeviled, Horatio.

207
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:08,560
Do you think Bush would agree
with you?

208
00:18:08,561 --> 00:18:11,089
-Well, no.
-Or Buckland?

209
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,278
-Each captain has his own way,Archie.
-Tell that to the poor-

210
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,772
young seaman of yours that
we scraped off the deck-

211
00:18:16,773 --> 00:18:19,770
-and threw over the side.
-May I remind you-

212
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,880
that when we first heard we were
to transfer to Captain-

213
00:18:22,881 --> 00:18:26,092
Sawyer's command, we
drank Portsmouth dry in celebration.

214
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,375
The man's a national hero.
He's earned his place in history.

215
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,860
It's not history that concerns me,
Horatio, it's the future.

216
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,720
It's far more uncertain.

217
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:00,797
-She sails well.
-Yes, she loves a stiff breeze.

218
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,000
This is a bit more than a
stiff breeze.

219
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,160
We'll have to get some sail off her.

220
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,433
The captain has to be informed first,
sir. Standing orders.

221
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,213
Very well.  Mr. Kennedy,
if you would, please.

222
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:37,143
-You want to take a reef, Mr. Bush?
-Yes, sir.

223
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,508
With your permission, sir.

224
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,612
Very good, Mr. Bush.
Call all hands.

225
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,160
All hands! All hands to reef topsail.

226
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,623
Man the halyards and reef tackle.

227
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,364
Reef tackles - haul!

228
00:20:03,365 --> 00:20:05,732
Put your backs into it!

229
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:23,777
'Vast hauling there!
'Vast hauling!

230
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,299
Who is that countermanding my orders?

231
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,860
-It's me, sir, Wellard.
-You'll be sorry for this, Mr.Wellard

232
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,460
Get down here immediately, sir.

233
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:36,988
There's a reef point caught in
the block sir, weather side.

234
00:20:36,989 --> 00:20:39,214
-The sail was starting to tear.
-What do you mean,-

235
00:20:39,215 --> 00:20:42,634
coming between me and
a man who disobeys me?

236
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,622
Mr. Wellard is on my station, sir.
He was only doing his duty.

237
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:49,940
Get down immediately, both of you!

238
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:03,922
Mr.Bush, be so good as to send
a hand to clear that reef tackle

239
00:21:03,923 --> 00:21:07,145
Aye, aye, sir.  You there, lay aloft
to clear that tackle.

240
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,551
Get below, Mr. Wellard.
You too, Mr. Hornblower.

241
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,743
I'll teach you to conspire.
Trying to make me a laughing-stock-

242
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:21,727
in front of the men.
Do you hear me?  Get below.

243
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:30,080
Mr. Buckland, call the hands
aft here, if you please.

244
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,876
All hands lay aft here.

245
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:46,819
I know where loyalty is to
be found, men.

246
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:49,560
I've seen it.  I see it now.

247
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:52,860
I see your loyal hearts.  I watch-

248
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:56,160
your unremitting labours, as
I watch everything-

249
00:21:56,161 --> 00:21:58,818
that goes on in this ship.

250
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:03,660
Traitors meet their just desserts

251
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:07,100
and loyal hearts get their rewards.

252
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,524
We'll splice the main brace!

253
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,930
A tun of rum to every man!

254
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,192
And to every boy!

255
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,560
Rum, on the forenoon watch.

256
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:28,040
They'll be drunk as lords.

257
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,122
Come on, close up, close up.

258
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:44,964
Mr. Matthews, lay aft here and
bring your mate with you.

259
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,185
Give me your rattan, Mr. Matthews.

260
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,180
Mr. Wellard's presence is required
by the captain, sir.

261
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,808
You too, Mr. Hornblower.

262
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,497
-Very well.
-I don't like it, sir.

263
00:23:17,498 --> 00:23:20,506
-The lad were only doing his duty.
-No way out of it, Matthews.

264
00:23:20,507 --> 00:23:22,834
-I could go a bit easier...
-Don't even think it.

265
00:23:22,835 --> 00:23:26,356
He'll notice, sure as sin.
It'll only make things worse.

266
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,160
No hard feelings, Mr. Wellard.

267
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:34,860
I've seen a beating, sir.I believe
I will stand it well enough.

268
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,637
-Good man.
-Come on then,let's get it over with.

269
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,488
And sir, thank-you
for speaking up for me.

270
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:54,560
It's an injustice, Horatio.

271
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,460
It's discipline, Archie.

272
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,060
One...

273
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:04,060
Two...

274
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,480
Three!

275
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:11,020
Four...

276
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:15,040
Five...

277
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,260
Six.

278
00:24:19,900 --> 00:24:22,320
Well, doctor?

279
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:26,580
The full dozen, if you please,
Mr. Matthews.

280
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,960
-Aye, aye, sir.
-Come on.

281
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,440
Seven.

282
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,560
Eight.

283
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:39,220
Nine.

284
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:43,220
Ten!

285
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,180
Eleven.

286
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:49,832
-Twelve.
-That's it, twelve.

287
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,660
Serves the little bugger right.

288
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,740
Very well.

289
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,272
The dishonourable part of
Mr. Wellard has paid-

290
00:25:06,273 --> 00:25:08,773
the price for his dishonour.

291
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:12,100
May that be a lesson to you,
young man.

292
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,617
Now, Mr.Hornblower,your punishment.
You think to be a colluder-

293
00:25:18,618 --> 00:25:21,520
and corrupter of your juniours
and to walk away scott-free.

294
00:25:21,521 --> 00:25:24,717
-Were that the case, sir…
-No quibbling with me, sir!

295
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,319
Were you still a midshipmen,
I would flog you like-

296
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,322
we have Mr. Wellard.
Your position, however,-

297
00:25:30,323 --> 00:25:33,315
dictates a more imaginative approach.

298
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:39,660
You are on continuous watch for
the next 36 hours, and I would-

299
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,691
remind you that an officer
caught sleeping on duty

300
00:25:42,692 --> 00:25:47,760
is subject to the most rigorous
penalty of the Articles of War.

301
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,460
-And you know what that is.
-Yes, sir.

302
00:25:50,461 --> 00:25:53,588
Then God help you if
you're found asleep.

303
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,260
Continuous watch, then,
Mr. Hornblower.

304
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:31,242
Yes, sir.  Thirty-six hours, sir.

305
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,820
It's a long time.

306
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:38,260
-Are you up to it?
-It is Captain Sawyer's wish, sir.

307
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:41,160
It doesn't do to cross the captain.

308
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:45,555
-It's a lesson we all learn.
-That was never my intention, sir.

309
00:26:45,556 --> 00:26:48,178
´Glad to hear it.  'Glad to hear it.

310
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:52,830
Stand firm.  Accept your
punishment and-

311
00:26:52,831 --> 00:26:56,960
-we'll near no more about it.
-Yes, Mr. Buckland.

312
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,860
Carry on.

313
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,580
-Reporting for duty, sir.
-Very good, Mr. Wellard.

314
00:27:26,688 --> 00:27:28,740
Mr. Wellard,

315
00:27:29,227 --> 00:27:32,100
those sandglasses need to
be run against each other.

316
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:34,420
Aye, aye, sir.

317
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:41,095
Mark off each minute on a slate
or you might lose your reckoning

318
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:46,260
Concentrate on the task in hand.

319
00:27:46,754 --> 00:27:49,840
It will help you to keep your
mind off the pain.

320
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,540
Thank-you, sir.

321
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,560
Mr. Wellard at work.

322
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:10,360
-Aye, aye, sir.
-"Aye, aye, sir."

323
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,293
Mr. Wellard has learned better now,
perhaps, than to conspire-

324
00:28:16,294 --> 00:28:21,250
against his captain…
against his lawful superior-

325
00:28:21,251 --> 00:28:25,320
set in authority over him by act
of His Most Gracious Majesty-

326
00:28:25,321 --> 00:28:30,489
King George II… has learned
that it is the painful duty…

327
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,266
Picking on Wellard again.

328
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,240
Yes.

329
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:39,660
Is that reasonable, do you think?

330
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,601
I don't see where reason
comes into it.

331
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,340
Mr. Wellard is sulking.

332
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:12,791
So,you decided to hold me up in
derision in front of the hands?

333
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:16,860
You and that cub, Mr. Hornblower.

334
00:29:16,861 --> 00:29:19,628
You plotted and planned so
that my lawful authority-

335
00:29:19,629 --> 00:29:22,794
-should be set at naught.
-No, not at all, sir.

336
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:25,247
Why attempt to deny it?

337
00:29:25,350 --> 00:29:28,660
Which one of you was it planned
to snag that reef point?

338
00:29:28,661 --> 00:29:31,813
-No one, sir.
-"No one, sir." How can that be?

339
00:29:31,815 --> 00:29:34,366
No one.  It was a plot.

340
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,888
So you pretend to be busy
to hide your face-

341
00:29:37,889 --> 00:29:40,600
because of the guilt that is
written upon it.

342
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,740
You think to deceive me.

343
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,940
I gave orders that Mr. Wellard should
test the glasses-

344
00:29:47,941 --> 00:29:50,779
-against each other, sir.
-You are sadly mistaken, Mr. Kennedy,

345
00:29:50,780 --> 00:29:54,348
if you believe there is any good
in this young fellow…

346
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:57,485
unless, of course, you are part and
parcel-

347
00:29:57,486 --> 00:30:00,845
-of this infamous affair.
-I was merely observing, sir,

348
00:30:00,846 --> 00:30:04,542
that he was busy only because
I told him to be so.

349
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,760
What do you say, Mr. Bush?

350
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,209
We can rely on your
judgment, I'm sure.

351
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:14,388
The boy knows nothing, sir.
He doesn't know the bobstay-

352
00:30:14,389 --> 00:30:18,346
-from the spanker boom.
-Oh no, Mr. Bush. You're too honest.

353
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,865
I knew it the moment I first saw you.
You don't understand-

354
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:25,060
these...poisonous young reptiles.

355
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:30,062
We must dredge the truth out of him.

356
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:35,002
Oh yes.  Get below, Mr. Wellard.

357
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:41,080
I'll have it out of you, by George,
I will.

358
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:45,160
Quartermaster, run for'ard and
get Mr. Matthews-

359
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:48,478
-to lay aft here, and his mate.
-Aye, aye, sir.

360
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:52,960
Another dozen and
he'll coo like a dove.

361
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,860
We must intervene.

362
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,620
-The captain is master of the ship.
-And he sought-

363
00:30:59,621 --> 00:31:03,200
your opinion sir,which I note
contained nothing to dissuade him

364
00:31:03,201 --> 00:31:05,664
from this beating upon which
he is now embarked.

365
00:31:05,665 --> 00:31:08,562
Mr. Hornblower, may I suggest you
take the time to remind-

366
00:31:08,563 --> 00:31:13,260
Mr.Kennedy that he is merely
fourth lieutenant aboard this ship?

367
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,713
He has the captain's ear,
why did he not speak-

368
00:31:17,714 --> 00:31:20,260
-when he had the chance?
-To say what?

369
00:31:20,500 --> 00:31:23,547
The captain's blood was up.
For Mr. Bush to have spoken up-

370
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:26,437
for Mr. Wellard would only
have provoked him further.

371
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,360
You think I should have
held my tongue?

372
00:31:29,361 --> 00:31:33,282
-You think I made it worse.
-You acted for the best.

373
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:37,151
Oh, well, there's precious
sop for my conscience.

374
00:31:37,152 --> 00:31:40,860
All on deck, there!
Sail-ho!

375
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:45,809
-Where away?
-Four points abaft the beam, sir!

376
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,036
Run aloft with your glass,Mr.Kennedy.
See what you make of it.

377
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,766
-Matthews!
-Hello.

378
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:07,860
-We're wanted aft.
-What now?

379
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:10,600
Bring your cane.

380
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,758
Oh no, not another one.
Who is it this time?

381
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,200
Young Wellard again.

382
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,666
There, sir, just for'ard
of the backstay.

383
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,408
French frigate!  Thirty-six guns,
she's cleared for action!

384
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,526
-Thirty-six, eh?
-Should we inform the captain, sir?

385
00:32:41,527 --> 00:32:44,427
-She's catching us fast.
-Disturb the lion on his prey?

386
00:32:44,528 --> 00:32:46,857
-Rather you than me, Mr. Bush.
-I'll go, sir.

387
00:32:46,858 --> 00:32:50,317
No… no need, Mr. Hornblower.
36 guns to our 74.

388
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:53,540
They'd never dare.

389
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:59,220
There's two of them.
Two Frigates!

390
00:32:59,221 --> 00:33:02,580
-Darn.
-That's changed the odds a bit.

391
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,508
-Sir!
-Mr. Hornblower, you'd better have-

392
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:11,874
-a good reason for this interruption.
-Yes, sir,-

393
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:13,931
Mr. Buckland's respects, sir and
there are two French frigates

394
00:33:13,932 --> 00:33:16,177
-on the starboard quarter.
-Tell Mr. Buckland I shall be-

395
00:33:16,178 --> 00:33:19,091
-on deck directly. Boswain…
-Sir, they're cleared for action-

396
00:33:19,092 --> 00:33:21,355
-and coming up fast.
-Thank-you, Mr. Hornblower.

397
00:33:21,356 --> 00:33:23,698
-That will be all.
-They'll be up with us in minutes,sir

398
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:26,450
Darn it, man, we can blow them
to pieces long before-

399
00:33:26,451 --> 00:33:29,020
we come into range of their
piddling little popguns.

400
00:33:29,021 --> 00:33:32,200
Not if we're not cleared
for action, sir.

401
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:35,748
You will answer for this later.

402
00:33:41,900 --> 00:33:44,461
We thought perhaps, sir, that...

403
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:54,520
Clear for action. Clear for action,
darn you! Beat to quarters!

404
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:04,717
Come on, men, look lively!

405
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:09,400
Open the stern port.

406
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:14,568
-By God, they're fast.
-Mr. Hobbs, you will oblige me-

407
00:34:14,569 --> 00:34:17,660
by taking a rope's end to those men
if they don't bestir

408
00:34:17,661 --> 00:34:20,860
their miserable selves.
What's wrong with them?

409
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:25,252
-Aye, aye, sir. Come on!
-Smarten yourselves up, men!

410
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,460
They're drunk. That's what's
wrong with them.

411
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,780
Beware a loose tongue, Mr. Matthews.
You never know-

412
00:34:30,781 --> 00:34:33,497
-where it might lead.
-Me tongue may be loose, Mr. Hobbs,

413
00:34:33,977 --> 00:34:37,360
but at least it's not raw from
licking the captain's ass.

414
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,642
Come on, put your backs into her!

415
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:49,100
My God, she'll be across our stern
any moment. God help us.

416
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:52,165
I'll have no muttering on my deck.

417
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,360
-Where are those damned powder
monkeys?
-Right here!

418
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,531
First powder monkey to stern chaser,
please, Mr. Wellard.

419
00:35:08,532 --> 00:35:10,625
-Put it on the side.
-Mind that tackle!

420
00:35:11,426 --> 00:35:13,499
Do you think we'll be cleared
in time?

421
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,631
God knows.  If this crew weren't
such an ill-disciplined,

422
00:35:15,632 --> 00:35:17,730
-drunken rabble, we would.
-That's not what I asked.

423
00:35:17,731 --> 00:35:21,425
Nevertheless, it's the point
at issue.  Mind that, damned it!

424
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:24,744
´Way for powder!  'Way for powder!

425
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,480
Mr. Wellard, here!

426
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,283
-Sir.
-If she shows any signs of bringing-

427
00:35:35,284 --> 00:35:37,788
her guns to bear, you're to
shout it out immediately.

428
00:35:37,996 --> 00:35:40,480
Come away, look lively!

429
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:42,938
Load!

430
00:35:44,684 --> 00:35:46,888
Pass it along, pass it along.

431
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,131
They're running out the guns on
the starboard side, sir!

432
00:35:52,132 --> 00:35:54,734
-Shot!
-Sir,I think she's about to open fire

433
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,924
Belay that shot. Run her
out as she is, darn it!

434
00:35:57,425 --> 00:36:00,199
-We're firing wadding, Mr. Bush.
-Wadding? What the devil?

435
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,760
She has to see our smoke.
None of our guns is ready.

436
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,466
-Very well.  Shot.
-Fire!

437
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:07,367
Sir?

438
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:09,720
Stand clear!

439
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,100
Reload!

440
00:36:14,300 --> 00:36:17,572
-Frenchman bearing further away, sir.
-Very good, Mr. Wellard.

441
00:36:18,873 --> 00:36:21,300
-Look lively, lads.
-Run her out!

442
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:26,660
Fire!

443
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,860
Fire!

444
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,120
She's running off now, sir.

445
00:36:41,300 --> 00:36:45,509
-We've frightened her off, sir.
-Very good. Very good.

446
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,052
An original concept, Horatio,

447
00:36:50,053 --> 00:36:52,340
to fire the contents of your
cot at him.

448
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:54,670
It would certainly have put
me off my aim.

449
00:36:54,671 --> 00:36:57,608
The Frenchman fell off the wind
at the first whiff of it.

450
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,460
Well, Mr. Hornblower.

451
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,860
Sir.

452
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:09,057
I'm informed that you fired your
stern chaser with no shot in it.

453
00:37:09,058 --> 00:37:11,650
-Is that true?
-The Frenchman was bearing away-

454
00:37:11,651 --> 00:37:15,165
preparatory to firing, sir.
I thought it of capital importance-

455
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:19,591
to make him think again, however
briefly,so as to give Mr.Bush-

456
00:37:19,592 --> 00:37:22,459
time to fire properly before we
received the full broadside,sir

457
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:25,122
Subtle, Mr. Hornblower, subtle.

458
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:27,525
How long did it take you to cook up
that story?

459
00:37:27,526 --> 00:37:30,024
Is this to be your career,
Mr. Hornblower, covering up-

460
00:37:30,025 --> 00:37:32,882
your incompetence with
ingenious fairy stories?

461
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:35,668
I submit, sir, that the ploy caused
the Frenchman to…

462
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:40,799
You submit?  Good.  Submit
to just criticism and in time-

463
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,947
-you might make a seaman.
-Sir, with respect,

464
00:37:44,248 --> 00:37:47,480
Mr. Hornblower and I agreed upon
a course of action, that-

465
00:37:47,481 --> 00:37:50,283
-his stern chaser should fire
its wadding.
-You too, Mr. Bush.

466
00:37:50,284 --> 00:37:52,971
-Are you joining Mr. Hornblower?
-No, no, sir; it might-

467
00:37:52,972 --> 00:37:55,583
have been the wrong course
of action,but I agreed to it.

468
00:37:55,585 --> 00:37:58,487
Mr.Hornblower posted Mr.Wellard
to observe the French frigate.

469
00:37:58,488 --> 00:38:02,974
Mr. Wellard… ah, yes.  I'm obliged,
Mr. Bush, much obliged.

470
00:38:03,075 --> 00:38:06,294
Mr. Hornblower and I have some
unfinished business-

471
00:38:06,395 --> 00:38:08,900
with regard to Mr. Wellard.

472
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,040
One.

473
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,940
Two.

474
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:23,420
Three.

475
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,240
Four.

476
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,320
Well?

477
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,160
-Sir, do I proceed?
-Well…

478
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:48,035
It's quite straight forward,Dr.Clive.
Mr. Matthews had beaten-

479
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:50,989
Mr. Wellard insensible.
Does he continue?

480
00:38:51,988 --> 00:38:54,740
Punishment, ended.

481
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:00,689
-Bring him to the sick-bay
-Then get back on watch,Mr.Hornblower

482
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:09,560
Mr. Hornblower.

483
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,820
Nasty business, that,
nasty business.

484
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,636
But then again, boys have been
beaten since history began.

485
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:21,250
It would be a bad thing for
the world if ever boys-

486
00:39:21,251 --> 00:39:23,299
should cease to be beaten.

487
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,160
That may well be your medical
opinion, Dr. Clive,

488
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:30,045
but I can see no useful purpose
served by thrashing a young boy

489
00:39:30,046 --> 00:39:33,132
-within an inch of his life.
-Come, come, Mr. Hornblower.

490
00:39:35,686 --> 00:39:38,399
A little tincture of laudanum
for the pain...

491
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:41,383
and all will soon be forgotten.

492
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,808
Forgotten, maybe, Dr. Clive.
But, forgiven?

493
00:39:47,908 --> 00:39:50,980
Careful, Mr. Hornblower.
I've had the good fortune-

494
00:39:50,985 --> 00:39:53,519
to serve the captain for over
15 years, and he has inspired-

495
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,799
nothing but loyalty in the men
under his command.

496
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:00,864
And that, too, is your medical
opinion, is it, Dr. Clive?

497
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:09,962
Article 19: "If any person in or
belonging to the fleet-

498
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:13,085
shall make, or endeavor to make,
any mutinous assembly-

499
00:40:13,090 --> 00:40:16,416
upon any pretense whatsoever,
every person-

500
00:40:16,417 --> 00:40:19,748
offending herein and being convicted
thereof by the sentence-

501
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:23,286
of the court martial shall
suffer death.

502
00:40:23,521 --> 00:40:27,471
And if any person shall utter
any words of sedition or mutiny,-

503
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:30,329
they shall suffer death.

504
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:36,304
And if any officer, mariner or
soldier shall behave himself-

505
00:40:36,305 --> 00:40:39,621
with contempt to his
superior officer...

506
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:43,406
or shall disobey any lawful command,

507
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:48,300
every such person
shall suffer death."

508
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:52,081
And I'll have you all know that
these articles apply-

509
00:40:52,082 --> 00:40:55,291
to my officers as much as
to anyone else.

510
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:59,540
-Carry on, Mr. Buckland.
-Aye, aye, sir.

511
00:40:59,841 --> 00:41:04,247
Division officers,
dismiss your divisions.

512
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,620
Dismiss!

513
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,424
-Mr. Buckland.
-Sir.

514
00:41:14,425 --> 00:41:19,252
Half-duty Sunday, today.
Double rum for all these good men.

515
00:41:25,656 --> 00:41:27,556
Sir.

516
00:41:35,686 --> 00:41:38,381
"Extra rum for the crew."

517
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,707
"This rule applies to my officers."

518
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:44,060
Yes.

519
00:41:46,200 --> 00:41:49,660
It's an interesting method of
fostering cooperation in the crew

520
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,560
Have you ever come across it before?

521
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:55,160
No, I most certainly have not.

522
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,742
Perhaps Captain Sawyer's methods
will prove consistent-

523
00:41:57,743 --> 00:42:01,036
in the end.
Perhaps it's only an impression.

524
00:42:01,237 --> 00:42:03,337
What?

525
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,660
The erratic nature of his command…

526
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,720
How do you find it?

527
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:15,815
Erratic.
Most erratic, to say the least.

528
00:42:15,816 --> 00:42:19,400
Thank-you, sir. I needed reassurance
that I was not misjudging-

529
00:42:19,401 --> 00:42:22,680
-the captain's mental powers.
-Not at all.

530
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:25,680
That is to say, probably not.

531
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:28,560
I suppose it's a matter for
Dr. Clive to pronounce him.

532
00:42:28,561 --> 00:42:31,560
That would be the appropriate
course, yes.

533
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:34,000
Good evening, gentlemen.

534
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:42,729
You are the officer of the watch,
are you not, Mr. Hornblower?

535
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,602
If you'll excuse me, sir,
I'm needed up on deck.

536
00:42:58,540 --> 00:43:01,180
Well, waste not, want not.

537
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,220
Put that back.

538
00:43:13,100 --> 00:43:15,520
Put that back.

539
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,098
Or do you want me to smarten
up that big ugly face of yours?

540
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:22,876
Randall, put it back.

541
00:43:56,700 --> 00:43:58,800
Mr. Hornblower.

542
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:03,970
-Well-rested, I trust.
-Sir, I'm…

543
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,753
Asleep on watch, you're as
good as dead already.

544
00:44:09,300 --> 00:44:12,190
I'll take you out and hang you
by the neck,

545
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:14,540
unless…

546
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:20,941
I do believe your life is in my hands

547
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,860
You fear me, sir?

548
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:28,760
I've always held you in
the highest regard, sir.

549
00:44:28,761 --> 00:44:32,982
Indeed.
I was once like you,...young,

550
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:36,440
intemperate,...

551
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,362
a danger to fellow officers.

552
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:44,096
-You would shoot me where I stand.
-Sir…

553
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,340
Here.

554
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,563
-Captain Sawyer, please.
-Don't trifle with me, sir.

555
00:44:55,564 --> 00:44:58,487
-Shoot me.
-Stop that!

556
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,760
You, too, Dr. Clive?

557
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:07,660
-Is there no one I can trust?
-You should be in bed, sir.

558
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,420
Give it to me.

559
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,220
You could do yourself an injury, sir.

560
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:23,332
Come, I shall give you something
to help you sleep, sir.

561
00:45:30,287 --> 00:45:33,300
Your life is in my hands.

562
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,255
Don't forget.

563
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:41,023
-Your life is in my hands.
-He won't forget sir.

564
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,260
Will you, Mr. Hornblower?

565
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,340
I will not, sir.

566
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,560
You'd do well not to let
Randall get to you.

567
00:46:03,561 --> 00:46:06,660
-But, he's so…
-Hey…You're boatswain's mate now.

568
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:09,020
It's your job to keep order.

569
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,760
Message from Mr. Hornblower.
Could you attend to him on deck?

570
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:16,040
-Is that all he said?
-No, he said, "Look lively."

571
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,620
Archie...

572
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,200
Ah, long night.

573
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:43,809
Oh, time is only the half of it.

574
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,580
I feared you were
the captain returning.

575
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,820
Oh, why?  What new madness
has he embarked upon?

576
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:56,911
What can we do for you, Mr. Hobbs?

577
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,228
Captain Sawyer...I've never seen
a man so unstable in his mind.

578
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:13,100
He wants to die, Archie.

579
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,100
Then, let him.

580
00:47:16,740 --> 00:47:19,300
My fear is that in doing so,
he'll delight-

581
00:47:19,301 --> 00:47:21,660
in all of us dying with him.

582
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:25,160
What now, Hobbs?

583
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,560
It's Matthews, sir.

584
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,672
You wanted to see, me, sir?

585
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:38,180
I think I'll call her, "Bessy."

586
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:47,162
Sir…

587
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:52,680
We have unfinished business, Styles.

588
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,480
You're not so tough without your mate
Matthews around, are you?

589
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:12,620
I don't need any help to teach
you some manners.

590
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,305
You don't need no knife, neither.

591
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,259
Get off me, bastard!
Get off!

592
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:46,818
'Should have realized I'd been
sent on a wild goose chase, sir.

593
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,460
Get off him, darn you!

594
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,460
By God, you'll pay for this.
Now, put him in irons.

595
00:49:00,663 --> 00:49:02,815
I was winning.

596
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:07,435
-What?
-He says he was winning, sir.

597
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:16,423
-Now, take him to the sick bay.
-All right.

598
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,960
-What the devil do you want?
-I heard there was some sort of-

599
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:26,186
an argument going on.

600
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:30,014
Natural high spirits below decks,
I dare say, sir.

601
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:35,353
I therefore ordered Randall to
be placed in irons;

602
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:38,560
Styles, who they'd kicked
almost to death…

603
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:42,700
You exaggerate, Mr. Hornblower.
There he stands, large as life.

604
00:49:43,200 --> 00:49:46,742
You're too squeamish.
I've noticed that about you.

605
00:49:47,200 --> 00:49:50,887
I daresay, sir.  Styles,
if you would, please.

606
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,499
Nevertheless, there he stands.
As I say, your squeamishness-

607
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,290
clouds your judgment.
I advise you to conquer it.

608
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:11,020
It does not bode well for your
conduct under fire,Mr.Hornblower

609
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:15,240
-With respect, sir, I find…
-Respect?

610
00:50:15,800 --> 00:50:18,387
What do you know of respect?

611
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,382
You come before me with these
men whose-

612
00:50:21,383 --> 00:50:23,941
boisterous high spirits led them
to knock each other-

613
00:50:23,942 --> 00:50:26,721
about a bit, and you expect
me to punish them.

614
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:31,445
I like high spirits in my men,
do you hear? What I do not like-

615
00:50:32,046 --> 00:50:37,391
are weak-kneed officers who do
not know how to keep order.

616
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:40,366
-Do you understand?
-I understand, sir.

617
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:44,460
Charges dismissed.

618
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:02,685
-Well?
-Charges dismissed.

619
00:51:02,985 --> 00:51:05,380
Believe me now, do you?

620
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:12,462
-What the devil is he up to?
-I suspect the evidence was before

621
00:51:12,463 --> 00:51:14,860
the captain before I opened
my mouth, the evidence-

622
00:51:14,900 --> 00:51:17,899
-he wanted to hear, that is.
-By God, I believe you're right.

623
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,300
"Weak-kneed officers who do not
know how to keep order."

624
00:51:20,301 --> 00:51:22,551
I've never heard the like.
Order?

625
00:51:22,552 --> 00:51:24,760
He doesn't know the meaning
of the word.

626
00:51:24,761 --> 00:51:27,217
Stay where you are, gentlemen.

627
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:32,400
There, every sign of guilt.
Bear witness to it, Mr. Hobbs.

628
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,820
Stand still.

629
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:44,180
-A mutinous assembly, I believe.
-No, sir.

630
00:51:44,181 --> 00:51:47,230
Do you give me the lie on
my own quarterdeck? Plotting,...

631
00:51:47,231 --> 00:51:51,860
whispering, scheming… now treating
me with gross disrespect?

632
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:54,460
I'll see that you regret this,
Mr. Buckland.

633
00:51:54,461 --> 00:51:58,060
-I intended no disrespect, sir.
-Again you give me the lie.

634
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,760
Mr. Bush, I'm disappointed in you.

635
00:52:02,761 --> 00:52:05,960
Why did you not see fit to report
this mutinous assembly to me?

636
00:52:05,961 --> 00:52:08,335
I wasn't aware of them, sir.
I was helping Mr. Wellard-

637
00:52:08,336 --> 00:52:10,636
take a noon site.

638
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,655
Mr. Wellard. Of course.

639
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:21,121
He will be in this, too.
You will be in trouble-

640
00:52:21,122 --> 00:52:24,188
with these gentlemen, Mr. Wellard.

641
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:28,700
You didn't keep a sharp enough
lookout, did you, boy?

642
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:31,661
I doubt if you have a friend left
on the ship.

643
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,255
But, later for you.
The lieutenants first,-

644
00:52:34,256 --> 00:52:37,350
as their lofty rank decrees.

645
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:42,840
You…

646
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:46,660
Mr. Hornblower,

647
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:50,959
you will resume your continuous
watch for a further 36 hours

648
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,542
and these three gentlemen
can report to you-

649
00:52:53,543 --> 00:52:55,828
-when every watch is called.
-Aye, aye, sir.

650
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:01,667
And, at every hour of every watch,
two, four, and six bells.

651
00:53:01,668 --> 00:53:04,555
Every watch, day and night,
every hour.

652
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:08,899
And, they're to be properly dressed,
that there be-

653
00:53:08,900 --> 00:53:12,517
no slackness in the execution
of this order. None!

654
00:53:12,900 --> 00:53:16,774
I will have means of knowing if
I am obeyed or not.

655
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,227
-Dr. Clive.
-Mr. Buckland.

656
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,362
-Mr. Buckland?
-May I rely on your confidentiality?

657
00:53:32,700 --> 00:53:35,164
Good, good.  Good.

658
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:38,531
-The captain...
-The captain?

659
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,595
Do you think…

660
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:45,112
How would you describe his mental…

661
00:53:45,113 --> 00:53:48,475
-powers, his mental state?
-I would not presume to describe-

662
00:53:48,476 --> 00:53:50,860
-my commanding officer's mental state
-You can't have failed-

663
00:53:50,861 --> 00:53:53,020
to notice his management of the ship.

664
00:53:53,021 --> 00:53:57,405
I would not presume,Mr.Buckland.
I advise you not to,either,sir

665
00:53:57,706 --> 00:54:00,594
-Ambition is one thing…
-Ambition?  What do you mean?

666
00:54:00,595 --> 00:54:02,599
I'm talking about the indiscipline
of the crew.

667
00:54:02,600 --> 00:54:05,550
-The ship is barely manageable.
-Hasn't it occurred to you-

668
00:54:05,551 --> 00:54:08,160
-that you would be captain?
-What? What are you talking about?

669
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:11,549
For God's sake, man, if the captain
were declared unfit,

670
00:54:11,550 --> 00:54:13,880
you would be acting captain,

671
00:54:13,881 --> 00:54:16,553
Master under God and all
the rest of it;

672
00:54:16,554 --> 00:54:20,140
sole arbiter of all lives aboard.

673
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,360
Sir.

674
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:20,520
Matthews.

675
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,195
How many hours is it now, sir?

676
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,239
-Thirty-five.
-Well done, sir.

677
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:52,332
'Managed 19 hours meself, once,
before I collapsed,-

678
00:55:52,333 --> 00:55:55,310
-dead on me face, sir.
-What happened then?

679
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,044
The captain was a kind man, sir.

680
00:55:58,045 --> 00:56:01,425
He gave me a dozen lashes and
let the whole matter drop.

681
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:04,760
-Pray God I'm as fortunate.
-Indeed, sir.

682
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:09,017
-Not that it'll…
-Let us hope not, Matthews.

683
00:56:12,800 --> 00:56:15,360
A lively crew.

684
00:56:15,800 --> 00:56:18,160
Not all, sir.

685
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,760
Some of the men don't like it
any more than I do.

686
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:25,068
-Watch your tongue, Matthews.
-Sorry, sir.

687
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:29,287
I speak for a third of the men, sir.

688
00:56:34,500 --> 00:56:38,366
-Carry on, Mr. Matthews.
-Aye, aye, sir. Mr. Wellard.

689
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:50,260
-You understand you duty, Mr.Wellard?
-I do sir.  Good luck.

690
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,524
I didn't know you were
a dancing man, sir.

691
00:57:28,525 --> 00:57:30,940
Just keep it down, would you?

692
00:57:36,787 --> 00:57:39,187
Who threw that?

693
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:44,540
The captain will hear of this.

694
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:49,956
He'll have a right laugh
when he does!

695
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,660
Suppose we declare him unfit
for command?

696
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,260
Suppose we put him in irons?

697
00:58:08,261 --> 00:58:11,695
We'd have to be quick and sharp
about it… if we do it at all.

698
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,060
He'll call on the hands and
they might follow him.

699
00:58:14,061 --> 00:58:16,297
But, suppose we were quick
and sharp about it?

700
00:58:16,298 --> 00:58:18,741
-Surely there must be some chance…
-Sir.

701
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,113
-Horatio?
-Listen.

702
00:58:34,600 --> 00:58:37,220
I thought I'd find you here.

703
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:42,020
Did you, indeed?

704
00:58:44,300 --> 00:58:48,841
The wardroom is deserted.I thought
you might be up to something

705
00:58:49,300 --> 00:58:52,023
I thought you might feel that
something had to be done...

706
00:58:52,024 --> 00:58:54,320
I'm not sure I follow you, Mr. Bush.

707
00:58:54,321 --> 00:58:56,799
...About the captain.

708
00:58:57,300 --> 00:59:01,285
-What?
-I thought you might feel...

709
00:59:01,286 --> 00:59:03,960
that the captain
wasn't fit for command…

710
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,460
-Mr. Bush…
-…as I do.

711
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:11,964
I think we're all of one mind,
Mr. Bush.

712
00:59:12,750 --> 00:59:16,656
Well, in that case,I'd be very glad
if you allow me to join you

713
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:24,920
Mr. Wellard!

714
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:31,090
I was expecting to see
Mr. Hornblower on watch.

715
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,700
Call of nature, Mr. Hobbs.

716
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:39,814
Well, I'll just wait a moment
for his return.

717
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:48,699
He's made a mockery of us.
Officers on continuous watch,

718
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:51,260
that's as good as a death sentence.

719
00:59:51,261 --> 00:59:54,660
And Mr. Hornblower, here,
how many hours has it been?

720
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:57,460
It's certainly a novel
approach to captaincy.

721
00:59:57,461 --> 01:00:00,182
-Novel? What about Wellard?
-I like it no more than you,

722
01:00:00,183 --> 01:00:03,143
-Mr. Kennedy.
-So, do we act now?

723
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:06,860
Do we take a chance…
and declare him unfit?

724
01:00:06,900 --> 01:00:10,546
And in Kingston, sir…
what will await us there?

725
01:00:10,547 --> 01:00:14,060
-A court-martial.
-Why?  Why?  What on earth for?

726
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:17,520
Well, this is mutiny, Mr. Buckland.

727
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,420
Mutiny.

728
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,985
Well, perhaps I should check
the wardroom-

729
01:00:25,986 --> 01:00:28,300
to see that Mr. Hornblower
is all right.

730
01:00:28,550 --> 01:00:31,309
I hardly think that necessary,
Mr. Hobbs.

731
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:34,700
Well, we wouldn't want anything
untoward to have happened,-

732
01:00:34,701 --> 01:00:37,160
would we, sir?

733
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,900
Where are they, Mr. Wellard?

734
01:00:39,901 --> 01:00:43,929
And this is the point.
It'll sound different in court.

735
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,040
We've been punished;
that could happen to anyone.

736
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:51,460
-It's no grounds for mutiny.
-And the crew?

737
01:00:51,461 --> 01:00:54,194
Double rum, make and mend.
It's not for us to criticize-

738
01:00:54,195 --> 01:00:57,326
the captain,
so the court will think.

739
01:00:57,900 --> 01:01:00,635
But when they see him, Horatio…

740
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:04,829
He's cunning.
And we all know he can talk...

741
01:01:05,164 --> 01:01:08,960
and find a reason for anything.
And he's plausible.

742
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:12,725
Wellard? A midshipman, no friends,
no family.

743
01:01:12,926 --> 01:01:15,460
What will the court say when
they hear the captain had-

744
01:01:15,461 --> 01:01:17,370
a boy beaten a couple of times?

745
01:01:17,371 --> 01:01:19,899
-They will laugh.
-And so would we...

746
01:01:19,900 --> 01:01:22,359
-if we didn't know.
-We will hang for it.

747
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:25,960
Twenty-two years,
I've held my commission.

748
01:01:26,900 --> 01:01:29,460
And now he'll break me.

749
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,380
He'll break the whole bloody ship.

750
01:01:36,400 --> 01:01:38,735
Sir…  Sir…

751
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:44,937
-Hobbs.
-You said to tell you, sir.

752
01:01:44,938 --> 01:01:48,960
-Yes, who?
-Lieutenants Hornblower, Bush,
Kennedy and Buckland…

753
01:01:49,300 --> 01:01:51,960
-Yes?
-Not on watch, sir;

754
01:01:52,300 --> 01:01:55,680
nor in the wardroom; and I thought…

755
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:58,660
Yes, by God, so do I.

756
01:01:58,661 --> 01:02:00,665
-Call out the guard!
-Sir?

757
01:02:00,666 --> 01:02:03,297
You heard me, Sergeant,
there's mutiny brewing,-

758
01:02:03,298 --> 01:02:05,499
black, bloody mutiny.

759
01:02:05,500 --> 01:02:07,740
Call out the guards!

760
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,300
If you find two or more of
these gentlemen together,

761
01:02:10,301 --> 01:02:13,456
you will tell them to stay
exactly where they are.

762
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:17,143
Forward you go, Mr. Hobbs,
to the hold and midship.

763
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,313
Flush them out, the verminous scum!

764
01:02:35,400 --> 01:02:38,699
-Mr.Wellard,why aren't you on watch?
-The captain,sir,he's coming

765
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,855
-Oh God, holly God!
-Anyone else?

766
01:02:40,856 --> 01:02:43,201
He sent Hobbs to cover
the midship  section.

767
01:02:43,202 --> 01:02:45,788
He's turned out the marine guard.

768
01:03:35,400 --> 01:03:37,590
Mr. Wellard, come with me!
You three get for'ard-

769
01:03:37,591 --> 01:03:40,203
and scatter when you're on deck.
Quickly now!

770
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:54,200
You two, go forward.

771
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:22,340
Come on!

772
01:04:23,650 --> 01:04:26,140
It's the captain.

773
01:04:58,300 --> 01:05:00,602
Help me, help me here.

774
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,720
Thank-you.
Let's get the grating.

775
01:05:12,200 --> 01:05:14,620
Mr. Wellard, this way.

776
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:23,860
-Who's there?
-It's me, Hobbs, sir.

777
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:27,620
-Where are they?
-They're around here somewhere.

778
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:33,080
Let's split up, here.

779
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:40,200
Over there.

780
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:44,724
Down there!  After them!
Hurry!

781
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:56,600
I hear you.

782
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:01,131
Out!  Out!

783
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:07,971
-Or do I shoot you where you stand?
-Run, go on, get out.

784
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,620
Stay where you are!

785
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,780
They've abandoned me.

786
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:22,513
Universal treachery.

787
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,960
Universal desertion.

788
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,772
My men, where are my true men?

789
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,960
Keep away!

790
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,339
-Sir…
-Keep your distance.

791
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:54,808
Sir...

792
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:21,560
Hold on , what was that?
Come on.

793
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:50,560
-Is he dead?
-Dr. Clive is with him now, sir.

794
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,500
What happened?

795
01:07:54,501 --> 01:07:58,860
-It would appear he fell, Mr. Bush.
-Fell?

796
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:01,660
-So it would seem, sir.
-Are you all right, Mr. Wellard?

797
01:08:01,661 --> 01:08:04,820
-You're shaking.
-Quite well, sir, considering.

798
01:08:04,821 --> 01:08:08,760
Mr. Wellard, would you kindly
retrieve the captain's pistols?

799
01:08:10,100 --> 01:08:12,460
They could be vital evidence, sir.

800
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:14,800
Ah, yes, indeed.

801
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:19,809
Sir, Captain was talking
about mutiny, sir.

802
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:22,860
"We've got to catch the mutineers,"
he says.

803
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:26,262
Did he give you any indication
as to the identity-

804
01:08:26,263 --> 01:08:28,983
-of these mutineers?
-No, sir. But, sir,

805
01:08:29,384 --> 01:08:33,056
Mr. Hobbs was with him.
'Might have confided in him, sir.

806
01:08:33,900 --> 01:08:36,762
Yes, thank-you.
Dismissed.

807
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:55,260
-We need to sway him up.
-Yes, very well.  Ah, Mr. Bush,

808
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,328
-get a tackle rigged.
-Aye, aye, sir.

809
01:08:57,329 --> 01:08:59,833
Mr. Hornblower!
Mr. Kennedy!

810
01:09:01,700 --> 01:09:03,760
Mr. Hornblower,

811
01:09:03,761 --> 01:09:06,760
about this… accident…

812
01:09:07,000 --> 01:09:09,180
Sir?

813
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:12,140
Never mind.  No, never mind.
It'll keep.

814
01:09:12,500 --> 01:09:15,712
-Sir?
-Thank-you, Mr. Wellard.

815
01:09:18,900 --> 01:09:21,540
Lift him together now, steady.

816
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:32,230
-The pistols, sir.
-Very well.  Over there.

817
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:38,420
-Will he survive?
-I think so.

818
01:09:39,900 --> 01:09:43,272
-Will he recover?
-Depends on what you mean by"recover"

819
01:09:43,273 --> 01:09:45,760
He's very severely concussed.

820
01:09:45,770 --> 01:09:48,290
I think what Mr. Buckland means
is will he recover sufficiently

821
01:09:48,291 --> 01:09:51,228
-to resume command?
-Impossible to say.

822
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:55,169
His skull's intact.
That's all I can tell you.

823
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:02,460
I will be on continuous watch, sir.

824
01:10:02,461 --> 01:10:06,032
We'll go with the captain's orders
until we know more.

825
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,127
Well, what else can I do?
He might wake up this afternoon,

826
01:10:11,128 --> 01:10:13,766
for God's sake.
Then what?

827
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:29,499
Out of my way, please, Mr. Hobbs.

828
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,860
I don't seem able to move.

829
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:34,860
Awkward, isn't it?

830
01:10:34,900 --> 01:10:38,060
It can't be helped.
Though, uh…

831
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:41,366
-you can help me, sir.
-In what way?

832
01:10:41,867 --> 01:10:45,377
Well, I was wondering what
happened to the captain.

833
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:48,836
And I fancy you know exactly
what happened.

834
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,440
Get out of my way or
I shall report you.

835
01:11:00,700 --> 01:11:03,199
How can I help you with that?
I wasn't there.

836
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:06,729
Oh, I think you can, sir.
For when the captain's recovered,

837
01:11:06,730 --> 01:11:09,497
there'll be shootings and
hangings aboard this ship.

838
01:11:09,600 --> 01:11:12,964
And you won't want to fall foul
of those. So, I think-

839
01:11:12,965 --> 01:11:16,570
you'll tell me. Afterall,
we wouldn't want to see-

840
01:11:16,571 --> 01:11:20,590
your young neck stretched
like a chicken… sir.

841
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:42,564
I don't like it.
I don't like it at all.

842
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:45,099
-Mr. Buckland, we didn't do anything.
-Perhaps not.

843
01:11:45,100 --> 01:11:47,511
-We all know what was said.
-Yes, but to no effect.

844
01:11:47,812 --> 01:11:50,371
-The events overtook us.
-That does not mean that-

845
01:11:50,372 --> 01:11:52,870
-I am comfortable with it.
-We did nothing other than consider

846
01:11:52,871 --> 01:11:56,660
-our options in those circumstances
-Fate intervened,Mr.Buckland

847
01:11:57,500 --> 01:12:00,272
And the air smells all
the better for it.

848
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:05,260
The captain's incapacity is not
a matter for celebration,Mr.Kennedy

849
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:08,373
Unless and until Dr. Clive pronounces
otherwise,

850
01:12:08,374 --> 01:12:12,002
I would remind you that he is still
in charge of this ship.

851
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:19,460
You want me to wake him, sir?

852
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,500
He hasn't slept for days.
Let him have a little longer.

853
01:12:29,820 --> 01:12:32,223
I don't envy his position.

854
01:12:33,120 --> 01:12:36,280
He's the one that would have
to assume command.

855
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:39,263
I bet the responsibility
weighs heavy.

856
01:12:40,700 --> 01:12:43,174
Why don't you get some sleep,
Mr. Kennedy?

857
01:12:43,175 --> 01:12:45,475
I'll stand watch for you.

858
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,899
Thank-you, Mr. Bush,

859
01:12:47,900 --> 01:12:51,980
-but I will share the watch with you.
-Very well.

860
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,260
Two days' sail from Santo Domingo.

861
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:37,660
Not long to whip this crew
into fighting shape.

862
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:41,710
No, Mr. Bush, but I am sure the task
will not prove beyond us.

863
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:45,860
-How did it happen?
-How did what?

864
01:13:46,300 --> 01:13:49,121
How did the captain fall down
the hatchway?

865
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,121
-He must have overbalanced.
-Is that all?

866
01:13:52,122 --> 01:13:56,168
-All? What do you mean"all"?
-You know what I mean.You were there

867
01:13:57,720 --> 01:14:00,171
Mr. Buckland's compliments and
can you both attend him-

868
01:14:00,172 --> 01:14:02,399
in the captain's cabin immediately?

869
01:14:02,400 --> 01:14:05,360
-He's lost his memory, you say?
-Yes, he does not remember-

870
01:14:05,361 --> 01:14:08,760
his accident at all,
or the hours preceding it.

871
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:11,760
Is he capable at present
of commanding this ship?

872
01:14:12,200 --> 01:14:14,599
It needs to be established,
Dr. Clive.

873
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:18,160
-At present, no.
-Then we all know where we stand.

874
01:14:18,300 --> 01:14:21,560
-For the present, we do.
-How do you propose to treat him?

875
01:14:21,700 --> 01:14:24,356
Well,  bleeding him.
I may purge him later.

876
01:14:24,357 --> 01:14:28,322
I've yet to refine a regime.
He's certainly calmer.

877
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:33,550
Calmer?
In what way has he not been calm?

878
01:14:33,651 --> 01:14:37,120
-He looks comatose.
-That may be a natural reaction-

879
01:14:37,121 --> 01:14:40,560
to his memory loss and so on…
to his injuries.

880
01:14:40,561 --> 01:14:43,190
What was this quite
"natural reaction"?

881
01:14:43,191 --> 01:14:45,760
He became a little agitated,
that is all.

882
01:14:45,761 --> 01:14:48,912
-How?  In what way, "agitated"?
-He showed symptoms,

883
01:14:49,013 --> 01:14:54,260
not extreme, of a certain
paraphronesis with occasional-

884
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,100
-phrenetical impulses.
-And in plain English?

885
01:14:57,201 --> 01:15:00,025
I could perceive certain symptoms
as I say…

886
01:15:00,326 --> 01:15:03,663
tendencies which led me
to suppose some irritation-

887
01:15:03,664 --> 01:15:07,456
of the meninges, the brain lining,
in plain English,

888
01:15:07,700 --> 01:15:11,130
-which caused me to think…
-In plain English, Dr. Clive,

889
01:15:11,131 --> 01:15:14,190
is the captain capable
of resuming command?

890
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:16,400
-No.
-Thank-you.

891
01:15:16,401 --> 01:15:20,556
-For the time being.
-Oh, we're back there again, are we?

892
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:24,886
And we won't know, will we,
if you keep him in this condition?

893
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,090
-What do you mean?
-You're giving him laudanum,
aren't you?

894
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:30,760
What business is it of yours?
I'm his doctor.

895
01:15:30,761 --> 01:15:33,790
One does not need to be a doctor
to know the effects of opiate.

896
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:36,860
What, you're dosing him with
laudanum, Dr. Clive?

897
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:40,199
-Well, are you?
-A certain dosage seems to be
appropriate.

898
01:15:40,200 --> 01:15:42,809
How will we ever know if the captain
is capable of running this

899
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:45,560
ship if you're keeping him in
a constant state of sedation?

900
01:15:45,561 --> 01:15:47,736
You will oblige me, Dr. Clive,
by leaving off-

901
01:15:47,737 --> 01:15:50,142
your drugging of the captain.

902
01:15:59,900 --> 01:16:02,159
I do believe a bit of bruising
about the face-

903
01:16:02,160 --> 01:16:04,460
improves your looks.

904
01:16:04,561 --> 01:16:07,149
I've had worse beatings at
the hands of me father…

905
01:16:07,150 --> 01:16:09,450
if he was me father.

906
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:13,380
Next time, I'm going to do you
for good, Styles.

907
01:16:13,420 --> 01:16:15,980
It's you we'll be tossing to
the crabs, Randall.

908
01:16:15,981 --> 01:16:19,016
'Cept they'd spit him out.
Because they're very particular-

909
01:16:19,017 --> 01:16:21,317
about what they eat, are crabs.

910
01:16:21,318 --> 01:16:23,655
It's more likely when the captain
comes back, you two-

911
01:16:23,656 --> 01:16:26,156
will be dancing from the end
of a rope.

912
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:28,899
You and whoever it was who pushed
the captain into the hold.

913
01:16:28,900 --> 01:16:31,860
Save it Styles.  He's all mouth.

914
01:16:32,100 --> 01:16:34,460
Oh no, that's a promise.

915
01:16:34,461 --> 01:16:37,160
I've got a nice bit of yardarm
for you two,

916
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,620
and an extra bit for Mr. Wellard.

917
01:16:41,200 --> 01:16:43,989
The captain fell; we all know that.

918
01:16:44,000 --> 01:16:47,742
-'Course he did.
-Anyway, you two won't be so leery-

919
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:50,500
if the captain doesn't come back,
I can tell you.

920
01:16:50,501 --> 01:16:54,560
-Why not?
-Because Lieutenant Buckland is
a born fool.

921
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,774
He couldn't command a trip
around the bay,

922
01:16:56,775 --> 01:16:59,175
never mind a seventy-four.

923
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:04,075
Dr. Clive, it is necessary
for me formally-

924
01:17:04,176 --> 01:17:06,510
to assume command of this ship.

925
01:17:06,517 --> 01:17:10,022
-What's preventing you?
-You are, Dr. Clive.

926
01:17:11,700 --> 01:17:13,947
You will not declare the captain
unfit for command.

927
01:17:13,948 --> 01:17:15,899
You keep prevaricating.

928
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:19,660
Until you declare him unfit,
it would be a usurpation of power.

929
01:17:19,661 --> 01:17:23,753
"Mutiny" in other words! Why are
you so frightened of the word?

930
01:17:23,754 --> 01:17:25,941
You don't seem frightened of
the fact that someone-

931
01:17:25,942 --> 01:17:28,303
may have shoved him down that ladder,
nearly killed him.

932
01:17:28,304 --> 01:17:30,495
That's what you should be concerning
yourselves with,

933
01:17:30,496 --> 01:17:32,860
not the niceties of taking over!

934
01:17:32,861 --> 01:17:36,560
-Dr. Clive, this is hardly helpful.
-Helpful be darned.

935
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,860
I served with him on 3 ships.
I know him!

936
01:17:39,900 --> 01:17:43,620
-The man's a hero.
-You're drunk, darn it, drunk.

937
01:17:43,621 --> 01:17:48,032
Dr. Clive, we are less than
2 days' sail away from Samana Bay,

938
01:17:48,033 --> 01:17:51,120
where we are to see action.
It is vital that you declare-

939
01:17:51,121 --> 01:17:54,572
the captain unfit to command
this ship and for it to be noted.

940
01:17:54,573 --> 01:17:57,700
You will please satisfy us as
to this point.

941
01:17:57,801 --> 01:18:01,760
Darned if I will.
There he is, you decide.

942
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,714
Satisfy yourselves!

943
01:18:05,800 --> 01:18:09,256
It may be a useful, cautionary
measure, sir, if Mr. Kennedy-

944
01:18:09,257 --> 01:18:13,483
were to note Dr. Clive's inebriated
condition.

945
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:15,913
It may be that he is
incapable himself-

946
01:18:15,914 --> 01:18:18,361
of carrying out his duties.

947
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,678
Too slow, gentlemen.
And we need to be faster-

948
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:43,154
-when we engage the enemy!
-Call yourselves a gun crew?

949
01:18:43,155 --> 01:18:45,399
We'll be blown out of the water!

950
01:18:45,400 --> 01:18:49,000
Right, let's show these bastards
how it should be done, eh?

951
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:53,420
Reload!

952
01:18:54,300 --> 01:18:57,568
-Gun ready, Mr. Hornblower.
-Run her out!

953
01:18:59,900 --> 01:19:02,860
-Gun ready, Mr. Bush!
-Run her out!

954
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:07,060
Fire!

955
01:19:12,100 --> 01:19:15,060
One minute, 35, Mr Bush,
to my one minute 28.

956
01:19:15,300 --> 01:19:18,160
-Better.
-But not good enough.

957
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,460
Reload!

958
01:19:20,900 --> 01:19:23,300
You're a real taskmaster,
Mr. Hornblower.

959
01:19:23,301 --> 01:19:25,565
We'll make a crew out of them,
yet, Mr. Bush.

960
01:19:25,566 --> 01:19:28,861
-Much better, gentlemen.
-We're getting there, sir.

961
01:19:28,998 --> 01:19:31,462
You unwell, Mr. Hornblower?

962
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:33,660
No, sir...

963
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:37,260
but I have a request, sir.

964
01:19:37,700 --> 01:19:40,700
-He wants to do what?
-That's what he said.

965
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:43,500
Well, whoever heard of that?

966
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,260
Come and look at this.

967
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,720
Could you do that?

968
01:20:09,200 --> 01:20:12,811
Hey, stop that Styles!
Pump, you sons of sea cooks, pump!

969
01:20:12,812 --> 01:20:16,200
They're pumping as hard
as they can, sir.

970
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:31,040
Styles!

971
01:20:34,300 --> 01:20:38,554
This is my ship, not a public
bath house!

972
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:42,560
Mr. Buckland, you will arrest
lieutenants-

973
01:20:42,561 --> 01:20:44,727
-Bush, Hornblower and Kennedy.
-Sir!

974
01:20:44,900 --> 01:20:47,817
Arrest them!  Unless you care
to join them!

975
01:20:51,500 --> 01:20:54,144
Very well.  Sergeant Whiting.

976
01:20:54,150 --> 01:20:56,676
Sir!  Come along, gentlemen.

977
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:11,557
And clap them in arms like
the mutinous dogs they are.

978
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:19,193
Santo Domingo
Samaná Bay

979
01:21:19,194 --> 01:21:21,894
By the mark...Five!

980
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:35,260
And a quarter less five!

981
01:21:48,820 --> 01:21:51,256
Deep four!

982
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:05,380
And a half four!

983
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:07,920
Heave!

984
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:12,020
Belay.

985
01:22:12,220 --> 01:22:14,410
It's no good, sir.

986
01:22:14,420 --> 01:22:16,980
We'll never bring the guns to bear.

987
01:22:17,320 --> 01:22:19,820
The fort's too high up.

988
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:22,680
-Sir…
-Get away!  Get away!

989
01:22:22,681 --> 01:22:25,153
Sir, I beg you.  We are standing
in to terrible danger.

990
01:22:25,154 --> 01:22:26,987
By the mark three!

991
01:22:26,988 --> 01:22:29,033
There is only a few feet
of water under us, sir.

992
01:22:29,034 --> 01:22:31,318
We must turn now,
before it's too late.

993
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:33,673
No, no, I don't want to.
I want to fight them.

994
01:22:33,675 --> 01:22:35,985
Then at least let me release
the other lieutenants.

995
01:22:35,986 --> 01:22:38,987
Without them there will be no one
to command the guns.

996
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:43,980
Oh, no, you don't, Mr. Buckland.

997
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:46,780
I know what you want.

998
01:22:46,781 --> 01:22:49,562
They'll stay just where they are.

999
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:56,260
We're going to come under
fire at any minute.

1000
01:22:56,261 --> 01:22:58,456
Why doesn't Buckland do something?
Most of the hands-

1001
01:22:58,457 --> 01:23:01,138
would back him up.
They're not stupid.

1002
01:23:01,339 --> 01:23:03,736
Hobbs, come here now!

1003
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:07,860
For God sake, man, this is madness.
Get us out of here.

1004
01:23:08,000 --> 01:23:11,267
'Can't do that sir. You know I can't.

1005
01:23:11,900 --> 01:23:14,286
You can't work the guns
on your own, Hobbs.

1006
01:23:14,287 --> 01:23:17,304
-You need us, Hobbs.
-I can't.

1007
01:23:18,500 --> 01:23:21,560
Hobbs, get us out of here now.
That's an order.

1008
01:23:23,600 --> 01:23:25,640
No.

1009
01:23:25,741 --> 01:23:29,151
-Darn, I thought we had him there.
-We did.

1010
01:23:38,120 --> 01:23:41,380
That's it!  That's more like it!

1011
01:23:41,800 --> 01:23:43,860
Return fire, Mr. Buckland.

1012
01:23:43,861 --> 01:23:46,372
We cannot elevate the guns
enough, sir.

1013
01:23:46,373 --> 01:23:49,369
I said, "Return fire" or by God
I will!

1014
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:57,220
-Engage the enemy, Mister.
-Sir…

1015
01:23:57,421 --> 01:23:59,946
A quarter less three!

1016
01:24:00,700 --> 01:24:03,161
This is my ship!

1017
01:24:09,100 --> 01:24:11,360
Fire!

1018
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:24,320
What the devil?

1019
01:24:27,000 --> 01:24:29,760
We're aground. God help us.

1020
01:24:30,300 --> 01:24:32,720
We're aground.

1021
01:24:32,800 --> 01:24:35,212
Styles.  Come on!

1022
01:24:44,700 --> 01:24:47,151
Heated shot!
They're using heated shot!

1023
01:24:47,152 --> 01:24:50,518
I wouldn't worry, Mr. Kennedy.
We'll drown long before we burn.

1024
01:24:50,519 --> 01:24:53,323
Ahoy there!  Ahoy there!

1025
01:24:54,127 --> 01:24:56,127
Here!

1026
01:24:57,533 --> 01:25:00,433
Go, grab ahold.   Hold tight.

1027
01:25:06,500 --> 01:25:09,524
Why is it I can never find you
when I need you?

1028
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:28,060
Get Clive.  Get the doctor.

1029
01:25:29,100 --> 01:25:31,727
And tell him to bring
a straight jacket.

1030
01:25:42,900 --> 01:25:46,047
-Where do you think you're going?
-No, you don't!

1031
01:25:48,600 --> 01:25:52,349
-Oh Randall, get out of my way.
-Make me.

1032
01:26:04,700 --> 01:26:07,520
Two, six, heave!

1033
01:26:09,500 --> 01:26:12,848
-Hold him down.
-Mr. Buckland's compliments
and will you-

1034
01:26:12,849 --> 01:26:15,129
-please come to the quarterdeck?
-My respects to-

1035
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:18,373
the first lieutenant,but no,
it's impossible.You see why,surely

1036
01:26:18,374 --> 01:26:22,055
-The captain, sir, he's not himself.
-Is he wounded?

1037
01:26:24,200 --> 01:26:27,885
-No, sir, but…
-Well, these men are!
Now pass me that sword.

1038
01:26:33,600 --> 01:26:36,160
Stand back, gents.
We'll soon have you out of there.

1039
01:26:36,161 --> 01:26:38,520
Do your stuff, Styles.

1040
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:44,250
Thank-you, Matthews.  Now, find
the carpenter and get that hole

1041
01:26:44,251 --> 01:26:47,586
-plugged up, then meet us up on deck.
-Aye, aye, sir.

1042
01:26:51,500 --> 01:26:55,180
-Mr. Buckland, you all right,sir?
-We're aground.

1043
01:26:55,900 --> 01:26:59,060
-Fast aground.
-We'll have to get her off with
the anchors.

1044
01:26:59,300 --> 01:27:03,146
-Where is the captain, sir?
-He's gone to earth somewhere.

1045
01:27:03,347 --> 01:27:06,060
I've sent young Wellard to
look for the doctor.

1046
01:27:06,300 --> 01:27:08,860
Where the hell is he?

1047
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:11,360
We'll need to get a cable out
through a stern port.

1048
01:27:11,361 --> 01:27:13,673
Well, Matthews can do that, sir.
I'll take a boat, and stand by

1049
01:27:13,674 --> 01:27:15,930
under the stern to take the cable
if you'll bring the anchor

1050
01:27:15,931 --> 01:27:18,313
round in the launch.  Mr. Kennedy
can man the capstan.

1051
01:27:18,314 --> 01:27:21,015
-Very good.
-Styles, you come with me.

1052
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,997
-Give us plenty of slack, Matthews.
-Aye, aye, sir.

1053
01:27:28,998 --> 01:27:31,756
-More slack!
-Come on, men!

1054
01:27:37,700 --> 01:27:40,099
Now give way together.

1055
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:42,540
Sir, if you please, the captain
was in a very bad way.

1056
01:27:42,541 --> 01:27:45,864
-I do beg you to go to him.
-In a minute.  In a minute.

1057
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:49,480
More ligatures.

1058
01:27:57,300 --> 01:28:00,054
Stretch out, Mr. Hornblower.
Stretch out.

1059
01:28:12,100 --> 01:28:14,455
Row, darn you, row!

1060
01:28:14,900 --> 01:28:19,449
Come on, quickly. We're going to lose
the anchor, come on!

1061
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,422
She's ready to go, come on.

1062
01:28:25,615 --> 01:28:27,715
Quickly, men!

1063
01:28:28,700 --> 01:28:31,240
Feed it through the anchor ring!

1064
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:36,244
Quickly, she's going to go down!

1065
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:42,141
-Quick, she' gonna go! She's going.
-Pull it over the stock.

1066
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:45,125
She's going down!  Quickly!

1067
01:28:46,720 --> 01:28:50,365
I'm drowning!  Mr. Hornblower,
my arm's trapped!

1068
01:29:42,600 --> 01:29:47,192
-Anchor's let go, sir!
-Heave away, there!  Heave away, men!

1069
01:30:00,296 --> 01:30:02,926
Powder monkeys!
Where are the powder monkeys?

1070
01:30:02,927 --> 01:30:04,940
Mr. Bush.

1071
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:18,242
They pushed me, that's what they did.

1072
01:30:18,700 --> 01:30:21,776
Pushed me.  Mutiny.

1073
01:30:21,900 --> 01:30:25,335
By God.  It is mutiny.

1074
01:30:28,100 --> 01:30:31,202
-Come on men, the ship's at stake!
-Heave, men!

1075
01:30:31,403 --> 01:30:33,818
Heave and wake the dead!

1076
01:30:50,500 --> 01:30:52,760
Move those bodies there.

1077
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:55,482
Stay to your post.  Get up!

1078
01:30:55,483 --> 01:30:57,583
Move the capstan back!

1079
01:31:07,800 --> 01:31:11,040
Where is he?  Where is he?

1080
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:15,274
He's over there somewhere.
Mr. Wellard, find Sergeant Whiting.

1081
01:31:15,275 --> 01:31:18,277
Bring him here with four of his men.
Quickly, now.

1082
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:28,863
Captain Sawyer, sir, it's me…

1083
01:31:30,100 --> 01:31:32,460
Dr. Clive.

1084
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:35,160
I was right.

1085
01:31:35,161 --> 01:31:37,732
Heave, darn it! Heave!
Do you want to sit here-

1086
01:31:37,733 --> 01:31:41,259
till the next tide while they shoot
us to pieces?  Heave!

1087
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:52,360
-Did you feel it?
-When the guns fired.

1088
01:31:52,361 --> 01:31:55,266
It must have broken the suction.
Double shot the guns.

1089
01:31:55,267 --> 01:31:57,875
-I'll tell Buckland.
-Double shot the guns!

1090
01:31:58,400 --> 01:32:00,449
Mr.Hornblower,what's happening below?

1091
01:32:00,450 --> 01:32:02,824
-If we miss this tide we're finished
-Mr.Bush's compliments,sir

1092
01:32:02,825 --> 01:32:05,360
We're about to fire every
gun double-shotted.

1093
01:32:05,361 --> 01:32:08,760
But, we can't elevate the guns
enough even to hit the fort.

1094
01:32:08,761 --> 01:32:11,560
Recoil may shake us free, sir.

1095
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,760
There, there he is.
He's one of them.

1096
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:17,608
Mutineers, all of them.
You're under arrest-

1097
01:32:17,609 --> 01:32:22,079
for mutiny and treason!
Now, Sergeant Whiting, do your duty.

1098
01:32:22,600 --> 01:32:25,360
The priority is to refloat
the ship, sir.

1099
01:32:25,361 --> 01:32:28,060
What?  So we should, yes.

1100
01:32:28,200 --> 01:32:31,321
Mr. Wellard, my respects to Mr. Bush.
Tell him to carry on.

1101
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:35,160
Stay there, you puppy!
I give the orders here!

1102
01:32:36,240 --> 01:32:38,827
-Mr. Wellard, if you please.
-Aye, aye, sir.

1103
01:32:39,227 --> 01:32:41,660
Do your duty, Sergeant.

1104
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:44,880
Darn your eyes, do your duty
or by God, I will.

1105
01:32:44,881 --> 01:32:47,520
Dr. Clive, is the captain fit
to command this vessel?

1106
01:32:47,521 --> 01:32:50,180
-You know it's not as simple as that.
-Arrest him!

1107
01:32:50,200 --> 01:32:53,760
Dr.Clive,if you continue to
prevaricate, we shall all die here.

1108
01:32:53,761 --> 01:32:55,716
-I'll count to three…
-Sir, I beg you.

1109
01:32:55,717 --> 01:32:57,456
One, Two!

1110
01:32:57,457 --> 01:33:00,668
-You're endangering the ship, sir.
Dr. Clive!
-All right, yes!

1111
01:33:00,668 --> 01:33:02,601
Three!

1112
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:08,940
Keep it going now, heave!

1113
01:33:14,400 --> 01:33:16,580
-What happened?
-Sergeant Whiting,

1114
01:33:16,581 --> 01:33:18,807
the captain has been declared
unfit for command.

1115
01:33:18,808 --> 01:33:21,560
Please disarm him and
escort him below.

1116
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:25,560
We're coming off!
Stand by the sheets!

1117
01:33:26,200 --> 01:33:28,413
Horatio, what's going on?

1118
01:33:28,414 --> 01:33:30,393
The doctor has finally decided
that the captain-

1119
01:33:30,394 --> 01:33:32,310
-is unfit to command.
-It was under duress.

1120
01:33:32,311 --> 01:33:34,690
Did you or did you not declare
the captain unfit for command?

1121
01:33:34,691 --> 01:33:36,931
You were being threatened with
a pistol, for God's sake!

1122
01:33:36,932 --> 01:33:39,520
-By whom?
-By the captain.

1123
01:33:42,700 --> 01:33:46,902
-Take him to his cabin.
-You'll swing for this. You all will.

1124
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:52,180
Tell me, Mr. Hornblower,
did you know that the captain-

1125
01:33:52,181 --> 01:33:54,681
-had fired his pistol?
-No, sir.

1126
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:57,700
Oh, I see.

1127
01:33:57,740 --> 01:34:00,480
We were hard aground, sir.
We were as good as dead already.

1128
01:34:00,481 --> 01:34:04,741
-You just took a gamble
-They seemed reasonable
enough odds,sir.

1129
01:34:05,500 --> 01:34:09,360
-Ready when you are, sir.
-Mr. Bush?

1130
01:34:09,361 --> 01:34:12,424
You're in command of
the Renown now, sir.

1131
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:16,120
Yes.  Very well.

1132
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:20,405
Let's get this ship underway
before the Dons sink us.

1133
01:34:20,406 --> 01:34:23,752
-Raise sheets and tack!
-Home, mails'l home!

1134
01:34:23,753 --> 01:34:26,163
Helm hard a larboard!

1135
01:34:46,531 --> 01:34:49,313
And so the ship was saved.

1136
01:34:49,514 --> 01:34:51,314
Yes, sir.

1137
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:56,025
It was Dr. Clive's opinion
that Captain Sawyer-

1138
01:34:56,026 --> 01:34:58,385
was unfit to command?

1139
01:34:58,386 --> 01:35:02,093
Reluctantly, yes;
that was his opinion.

1140
01:35:02,994 --> 01:35:05,420
Well, that's something, at least.

1141
01:35:05,800 --> 01:35:08,528
But, you do realize, sir,
it's your word against his.

1142
01:35:08,530 --> 01:35:10,850
It was for the good of
the Service, sir;

1143
01:35:10,851 --> 01:35:14,139
-and for the safety of the ship.
-By God, Mr. Hornblower,-

1144
01:35:14,540 --> 01:35:17,288
I hope you can back that up with
solid evidence because from-

1145
01:35:17,289 --> 01:35:20,668
where I'm standing, I wouldn't lay
great odds on an acquittal.

1146
01:35:20,969 --> 01:35:22,969
No, sir.

1147
01:35:24,500 --> 01:35:27,032
-I'm afraid you're right
-So, you say Captain Sawyer's
condition

1148
01:35:27,033 --> 01:35:29,396
-was due to falling down the hatchway
-That's what seemed-

1149
01:35:29,397 --> 01:35:31,250
to push him over the edge, sir.

1150
01:35:31,251 --> 01:35:34,495
That's a very interesting choice
of words, Mr. Hornblower.

1151
01:35:36,940 --> 01:35:40,420
How did the captain come to fall?

1152
01:35:41,420 --> 01:35:51,420
