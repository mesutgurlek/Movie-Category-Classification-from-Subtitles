Helsinki-Filmi presents

1
00:00:08,527 --> 00:00:12,679
in co-production with
Two Thirty Five-2 35 & Mogador Film

2
00:00:28,767 --> 00:00:31,440
an Aku Louhimies film

3
00:00:48,087 --> 00:00:51,636
Finnish Civil War, end of April 1 9 1 8

4
00:00:52,847 --> 00:00:56,044
The victorious Whites hunt down
the remaining Red Guards.

5
00:00:56,207 --> 00:00:59,643
2,000 female soldiers fought
amongst the Red ranks.

6
00:01:21,167 --> 00:01:22,759
Ready? -Yes.

7
00:01:27,007 --> 00:01:28,406
Let's go.

8
00:01:47,527 --> 00:01:49,119
Cross the river!

9
00:02:12,567 --> 00:02:14,159
To the shore!

10
00:02:41,847 --> 00:02:43,439
Let go of me!

11
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:47,886
There!

12
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:50,486
From the flank!

13
00:03:37,847 --> 00:03:42,238
TEARS OF APRIL

14
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:08,956
Will mother come soon?

15
00:04:44,327 --> 00:04:47,080
Dig, and you'll soon
see your father.

16
00:04:48,487 --> 00:04:50,284
Dig, damn you!

17
00:05:23,207 --> 00:05:24,959
Miina...

18
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:38,686
If I don't make it,
you'll look after him.

19
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:43,162
Promise me.

20
00:05:44,767 --> 00:05:46,359
I promise.

21
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:53,276
On your feet, whores!

22
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:15,843
Kajander, Svan, Virta!

23
00:07:20,127 --> 00:07:22,687
Why did the music stop?

24
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:19,481
Detachment - halt!

25
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:25,204
They have to be sentenced first,
Sergeant Major.

26
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:30,123
Sergeant Major, sir.
-Get in line.

27
00:08:30,287 --> 00:08:32,278
They have to be taken
to be court-martialed.

28
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:35,837
Red whores, be gone with you.
-This is unlawful!

29
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:37,679
Go.

30
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:40,277
You're free to go.

31
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:45,285
Go home. Go on.

32
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:50,922
Go! Get out of here!
-This is unlawful I tell you.

33
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:53,282
Go, red whores!

34
00:08:55,567 --> 00:08:57,683
Go on now.

35
00:09:02,807 --> 00:09:06,083
The prisoners are escaping! Fire!

36
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:09,679
Don't shoot, damn it!

37
00:09:40,807 --> 00:09:47,076
That's that.
Now lads, let us drink!

38
00:09:52,687 --> 00:09:55,485
Harjula, secure the area.

39
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:36,123
Take it easy now!

40
00:11:44,087 --> 00:11:46,920
Damn it, Harjula!

41
00:11:47,367 --> 00:11:52,122
You were to secure the area!
The men are celebrating!

42
00:11:53,287 --> 00:11:57,519
This is war.
Escaping prisoners are shot.

43
00:11:57,687 --> 00:12:00,759
There's no war here.

44
00:12:06,327 --> 00:12:09,364
Who do you think you are?

45
00:12:11,807 --> 00:12:17,643
I won't awaken
the Jaeger Lieutenant. He's tired.

46
00:12:18,087 --> 00:12:21,796
Very tired.
He's very tired!

47
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:26,279
I need to take the prisoner
to be court-martialed.

48
00:12:29,687 --> 00:12:31,678
Damn it, Harjula!

49
00:12:33,207 --> 00:12:38,486
I won't do anything illegal. I'll
have this woman court-martialed.

50
00:12:40,367 --> 00:12:42,835
I need a horse.

51
00:12:43,527 --> 00:12:47,042
You need a horse!

52
00:12:55,727 --> 00:12:59,197
Take a boat.

53
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,206
Fucking Russian whore!

54
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:08,040
Go! Get out!

55
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:18,087
Put these on.

56
00:13:35,887 --> 00:13:41,041
My name is Aaro.
What's yours?

57
00:13:51,687 --> 00:13:58,126
It was curious,
intercepting your troop.

58
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:02,724
You all spoke Finnish.

59
00:14:04,527 --> 00:14:08,122
We thought
we were chasing Russians.

60
00:14:34,647 --> 00:14:38,117
We'll get there before dark.

61
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:46,879
We once taught the boy next door
to swim.

62
00:14:47,047 --> 00:14:51,086
We tied him with a rope
to a boat like this -

63
00:14:51,287 --> 00:14:54,085
and dragged him across the lake.

64
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:57,919
He screamed like hell,
but learned to swim nevertheless.

65
00:14:58,087 --> 00:15:00,476
You row like shit.

66
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:06,886
Well, well. You can speak.

67
00:15:09,247 --> 00:15:13,035
Here's a coat if you're cold.

68
00:15:15,687 --> 00:15:18,247
Bloody weather.

69
00:15:24,127 --> 00:15:27,881
Judge Hallenberg
is a sophisticated man.

70
00:15:28,167 --> 00:15:30,203
A writer and a humanist.

71
00:15:30,367 --> 00:15:33,996
He's fair,
the best judge you can have.

72
00:15:36,127 --> 00:15:37,924
Give me a cigarette.
-What?

73
00:15:38,087 --> 00:15:39,839
A cigarette!

74
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:51,602
Sit down, no standing
in the boat. That's the rule.

75
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:39,358
Damn it!

76
00:21:19,687 --> 00:21:23,680
Poor Finnish people
Starting to break free

77
00:21:24,527 --> 00:21:28,520
They've had enough of suffering

78
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:32,675
The White oppressors...

79
00:21:46,007 --> 00:21:48,567
Tell me your name.

80
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:55,886
Then I'd know who
I'm taking to be court-martialed.

81
00:21:57,647 --> 00:22:02,482
If you got a good fuck, would you
forget about the court-martial?

82
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:56,279
What?

83
00:24:32,127 --> 00:24:35,164
This isn't too bad.

84
00:24:39,207 --> 00:24:42,358
A hungry person
will eat anything.

85
00:24:46,687 --> 00:24:49,076
Another person, if necessary.

86
00:24:57,607 --> 00:25:00,724
What they did to you
when you were caught...

87
00:25:01,607 --> 00:25:03,723
It was wrong.

88
00:26:48,967 --> 00:26:51,037
There's a boat.

89
00:26:51,207 --> 00:26:52,640
Get dressed.

90
00:27:28,647 --> 00:27:34,279
We had to swim to shore.
-These waters are treacherous.

91
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:04,640
I guess you can take these off now.

92
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:13,283
Let's just go.

93
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:52,084
Here you are.

94
00:29:05,607 --> 00:29:11,284
Sir, Jaeger Harjula
reporting for court-martial...

95
00:29:11,447 --> 00:29:14,086
Thank you.
Paasonen, knife.

96
00:29:15,367 --> 00:29:19,918
I've heard about you, Harjula.
Your unit wondered about you.

97
00:29:20,087 --> 00:29:23,238
It took you a week to get here.

98
00:29:25,967 --> 00:29:29,357
Our boat capsized in high winds.
We were shipwrecked on an island.

99
00:29:29,527 --> 00:29:36,000
At ease, Jaeger. We're taking
the last prisoners to Tammisaari.

100
00:29:51,407 --> 00:29:55,559
What's the name of your prisoner?
-I don't know.

101
00:29:56,327 --> 00:30:00,240
I've asked several times,
but she refuses to answer.

102
00:30:00,407 --> 00:30:03,604
You've had a rough time
with that she-wolf. -No...

103
00:30:03,767 --> 00:30:06,759
Paasonen,
take care of Jaeger Harjula.

104
00:30:06,927 --> 00:30:09,282
You're quite a hero.

105
00:30:29,247 --> 00:30:32,762
You've had the best
military training in the world.

106
00:30:32,927 --> 00:30:35,122
The saviours of the fatherland.

107
00:30:35,607 --> 00:30:41,079
You're top quality, Harjula, just
like this wine. Excellent bouquet.

108
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:46,326
This used to be a mental hospital,
a sanatorium.

109
00:30:46,487 --> 00:30:49,081
For upper-class loonies.

110
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:55,795
Doctor Carpelan was a reformist.
He wanted to treat patients -

111
00:30:56,447 --> 00:30:59,245
according to
a Tolstoian ideology.

112
00:31:00,247 --> 00:31:02,761
Carpelan had a vision.

113
00:31:05,367 --> 00:31:08,962
Patients used to fish
and do gardening.

114
00:31:10,207 --> 00:31:15,440
They could meditate in tree huts,
naked if they liked.

115
00:31:17,527 --> 00:31:21,805
Carpelan was interested in the
effect of light on the human mind.

116
00:31:25,327 --> 00:31:30,355
I, too, have studied ways
to repair the mind.

117
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:34,558
Fascinating business.

118
00:31:36,007 --> 00:31:37,759
Paasonen.

119
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:43,840
Set out the coffee and cognac.
Then you may leave. -Thank you.

120
00:31:44,007 --> 00:31:46,965
Shall I serve the port as well?
-Yes.

121
00:31:52,167 --> 00:31:54,886
Don't get me wrong.

122
00:31:55,247 --> 00:31:59,160
My interest in the human mind
is purely professional.

123
00:31:59,807 --> 00:32:03,595
In civilian life, I'm an author.
-We have your book.

124
00:32:03,767 --> 00:32:06,918
I see. Which one?

125
00:32:09,887 --> 00:32:14,244
A poetry book.
I haven't had the time to read it.

126
00:32:15,127 --> 00:32:20,201
I did read your articles
before my training.

127
00:32:20,447 --> 00:32:24,076
They inspired many people to leave.
-You're flattering me.

128
00:32:24,487 --> 00:32:28,036
Everybody wanted to get rid
of the Russians. -Jaeger.

129
00:32:28,527 --> 00:32:32,839
Judge Advocate, sir.
-To the fatherland.

130
00:32:40,047 --> 00:32:48,603
Child of Finland, thou shalt never
Abandon the greatest country of all

131
00:33:00,607 --> 00:33:05,158
They say you're an excellent judge,
honest and just. -Jaeger.

132
00:33:06,287 --> 00:33:12,362
They're scum, with blood on their
hands. Do they deserve mercy?

133
00:33:13,607 --> 00:33:17,077
I clear up things
if they need to be cleared up.

134
00:33:17,407 --> 00:33:21,685
The prisoner is not well.
-You don't even know her name.

135
00:33:22,007 --> 00:33:24,521
Even these savages
have human dignity.

136
00:33:24,687 --> 00:33:28,362
And humans always have a name.

137
00:33:39,327 --> 00:33:43,161
Fear not.
Justice will be done.

138
00:33:46,487 --> 00:33:49,524
Can you imagine -

139
00:33:50,407 --> 00:33:56,562
that at first,
my firing squad were all sheep.

140
00:33:59,167 --> 00:34:03,445
For God's sake.
I am a literary man -

141
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:08,526
and I had to show them
how to kill a man.

142
00:34:09,287 --> 00:34:11,278
How ironic is that?

143
00:34:11,447 --> 00:34:17,158
An author and a humanist
teaching people to act like animals.

144
00:34:22,887 --> 00:34:26,641
Killing without remorse.

145
00:34:35,487 --> 00:34:39,560
It seems we can learn
to love anything.

146
00:35:02,007 --> 00:35:05,443
You look tired. Get some sleep.

147
00:35:06,287 --> 00:35:09,484
Tomorrow we'll start
solving the mystery.

148
00:35:10,967 --> 00:35:14,562
Good night.
-Good night.

149
00:35:22,447 --> 00:35:26,122
Soldier boy, soldier boy...

150
00:35:52,967 --> 00:35:55,162
Load.

151
00:35:56,047 --> 00:35:58,163
Aim.

152
00:36:10,967 --> 00:36:12,878
Fire!

153
00:36:40,767 --> 00:36:42,405
There.

154
00:36:45,727 --> 00:36:47,763
Stand still.

155
00:37:03,447 --> 00:37:04,880
Move.

156
00:37:24,047 --> 00:37:25,321
Name.

157
00:37:27,007 --> 00:37:28,281
Name.

158
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:32,998
Profession.

159
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:38,357
Place of residence.

160
00:37:50,527 --> 00:37:53,439
When did you join the Red Guard?

161
00:37:54,967 --> 00:37:57,527
What was your mission?

162
00:37:59,247 --> 00:38:03,684
Were you forced
or did you volunteer?

163
00:38:13,687 --> 00:38:14,915
Take her away.

164
00:38:25,447 --> 00:38:28,280
What's this? -Sit still.

165
00:38:30,847 --> 00:38:34,522
Ghosts.
-What ghosts?

166
00:38:45,247 --> 00:38:49,479
Doctor Carpelan.
He hanged himself.

167
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,560
His life's work was taken away.

168
00:38:52,727 --> 00:38:55,958
Konsta was the only patient
who survived. -I've finished.

169
00:38:56,127 --> 00:38:59,802
The others died of thirst.
-Water, water.

170
00:39:01,287 --> 00:39:05,280
At ease.
Tragic, if not horrific.

171
00:39:06,207 --> 00:39:09,358
You've slept like a baby
while I've been working.

172
00:39:09,527 --> 00:39:14,681
People have been condemned to Hell.
I've questioned your prisoner.

173
00:40:08,687 --> 00:40:12,566
Hallenberg.
The West Uusimaa HQ, please.

174
00:40:51,127 --> 00:40:54,915
You don't seem too timid.

175
00:41:03,247 --> 00:41:05,477
What did you do on the island?

176
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:14,164
Have you studied the human mind?

177
00:41:14,687 --> 00:41:21,240
You can read, can't you?
And not only propaganda.

178
00:41:31,207 --> 00:41:34,597
Spit out your name
and you'll get food.

179
00:42:02,407 --> 00:42:05,240
Have you ever had a dream -

180
00:42:08,327 --> 00:42:12,957
in which you were young?
You didn't know it was dream.

181
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,242
Your name.

182
00:42:56,807 --> 00:42:58,798
Now then.

183
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:16,046
Do you hunt, Aaro?
-Not really, no.

184
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:22,523
Neither do I, but I love
the taste of wild game.

185
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:28,525
Now we know
the name of that woman.

186
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,677
Miina Malin.

187
00:43:33,847 --> 00:43:38,637
Now we know her name.
-Something happened on the island.

188
00:43:52,687 --> 00:43:55,679
Paasonen.
-Judge Advocate, sir.

189
00:44:01,527 --> 00:44:05,725
I know she survived an execution.

190
00:44:08,047 --> 00:44:09,719
I wasn't involved in...

191
00:44:10,047 --> 00:44:14,962
Do I have to arrest you
for assisting the Reds?

192
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:22,364
No. -She stays confined,
but I assume she's guilty.

193
00:44:24,327 --> 00:44:25,760
Paasonen.

194
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:32,559
Let's get drunk.

195
00:44:37,447 --> 00:44:41,565
The ends of our swords
Hold the key to our happiness

196
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:45,601
We shall not give in

197
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:54,876
We go to war for our country
That wants to break free

198
00:44:58,727 --> 00:45:02,800
Paasonen!
Where's Paasonen?

199
00:45:07,807 --> 00:45:12,358
He's in the kitchen again,
drinking our booze.

200
00:45:15,727 --> 00:45:17,160
Aaro.

201
00:45:18,127 --> 00:45:24,157
To meet one's own wife,
after all these executions...

202
00:45:25,327 --> 00:45:30,082
After having waded in blood up to
one's knees, it feels repulsive.

203
00:45:38,327 --> 00:45:43,526
Aaro, do you have a wife?

204
00:45:44,647 --> 00:45:49,163
Waiting for you
to return from the war.

205
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,880
I guessed you're a bachelor.

206
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:40,080
Thank you.

207
00:47:49,407 --> 00:47:52,922
Miina. Was it Miina?

208
00:47:57,087 --> 00:47:58,679
Miina.

209
00:48:00,847 --> 00:48:02,758
Give me a cigarette.

210
00:48:12,407 --> 00:48:15,444
I came to say goodbye.

211
00:48:18,967 --> 00:48:25,122
I've been away for so long
that it's better for me to go back.

212
00:48:37,927 --> 00:48:41,522
Help yourself and tell them
what you've done.

213
00:48:41,687 --> 00:48:46,283
Tell them you didn't fight
and didn't use a gun.

214
00:48:48,247 --> 00:48:51,364
And don't say anything about us.

215
00:49:01,847 --> 00:49:05,522
If there's anything I can do...

216
00:49:13,887 --> 00:49:16,242
Wait.

217
00:49:17,087 --> 00:49:19,521
The boy is called Eino.

218
00:49:20,247 --> 00:49:23,557
He's in Tammistonkylä.
At the house of Rapola.

219
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:29,085
Go and see if he's alright.
Promise me.

220
00:49:34,007 --> 00:49:35,884
I promise.

221
00:50:01,127 --> 00:50:04,278
You got out of there alive.
-I did.

222
00:50:04,807 --> 00:50:07,844
You deserve a drink.
-No, thank you.

223
00:50:09,847 --> 00:50:13,203
Did Miss Malin talk?
-Not much.

224
00:50:14,487 --> 00:50:16,876
Never mind.
We're having roast for dinner.

225
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:19,515
I have to return to my unit.

226
00:50:21,967 --> 00:50:23,685
Your unit...

227
00:50:28,167 --> 00:50:30,158
Pity.

228
00:50:34,527 --> 00:50:38,076
I could have used
sophisticated company.

229
00:52:13,087 --> 00:52:15,078
Good day.

230
00:52:15,607 --> 00:52:18,883
Is this the house of Rapola?

231
00:52:31,767 --> 00:52:33,837
Are you Eino?
-Yes, I am.

232
00:52:34,007 --> 00:52:38,876
He's Eikka the Bastard.
-I see.

233
00:52:39,647 --> 00:52:42,559
What's your business?

234
00:52:43,287 --> 00:52:47,166
I came to see the boy.
-To collect him?

235
00:52:47,367 --> 00:52:52,157
He's all yours.
We can't feed them all. -No...

236
00:52:53,527 --> 00:52:56,837
The court-martial in Ruukkio
sent me to see how he's doing.

237
00:52:57,007 --> 00:53:01,285
He's starving
like all the other children here.

238
00:53:03,127 --> 00:53:05,197
Are his parents dead?

239
00:53:08,527 --> 00:53:11,564
His father is, at least.

240
00:53:17,767 --> 00:53:24,161
Do you know about his mother,
Miina Malin?

241
00:53:25,207 --> 00:53:31,680
Her name is Martta Kivelä.
She followed our son to war.

242
00:53:32,087 --> 00:53:34,920
We haven't heard
from that whore since.

243
00:53:35,887 --> 00:53:38,720
She left her bastard son here.
-Do you know my mother?

244
00:53:38,887 --> 00:53:42,243
His mother is a whore.
-Shut up, Vieno.

245
00:53:42,567 --> 00:53:44,603
Eikka the Bastard.

246
00:53:47,607 --> 00:53:49,882
Get inside! Eino, too.

247
00:53:50,367 --> 00:53:51,880
Is my mother alive?

248
00:53:52,047 --> 00:53:55,926
What the hell are you looking at?
Get back to work!

249
00:53:56,287 --> 00:54:01,486
She fucked them all,
that fucking socialist.

250
00:54:01,967 --> 00:54:05,482
The biggest whore there ever was.

251
00:54:05,647 --> 00:54:10,004
Put the axe down.
-Fucking butcher. Be gone with you.

252
00:54:11,927 --> 00:54:13,918
She was a whore alright!

253
00:55:01,687 --> 00:55:03,439
Did you run away?

254
00:55:06,927 --> 00:55:11,364
Mr. Soldier, can I come with you?
-Go home.

255
00:55:11,687 --> 00:55:14,520
Is my mother dead?
-Yes.

256
00:55:17,327 --> 00:55:20,763
Go home.
-Did she love me?

257
00:55:25,047 --> 00:55:27,356
Go home!

258
00:56:09,327 --> 00:56:15,004
As death is upon us,
Lord Jesus, look after me.

259
00:56:17,127 --> 00:56:22,155
Strengthen my hope and my faith,
be with me.

260
00:56:22,727 --> 00:56:25,560
I give myself to Thee.

261
00:56:26,327 --> 00:56:28,238
Have mercy!

262
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,917
Can I shoot?

263
00:58:30,207 --> 00:58:33,085
I'm sure mother will come back.

264
00:58:40,847 --> 00:58:42,041
Give me that.

265
00:59:15,727 --> 00:59:17,922
Where are we going?

266
00:59:18,607 --> 00:59:24,477
The oppressors whipping our backs

267
00:59:24,647 --> 00:59:29,402
We must fight the White Army

268
00:59:30,367 --> 00:59:35,805
We must die or win

269
00:59:35,967 --> 00:59:41,280
The result remains to be seen

270
00:59:45,487 --> 00:59:47,603
Thank you.

271
00:59:57,407 --> 01:00:00,205
The oppressors...

272
01:00:03,607 --> 01:00:06,041
...whipping our backs

273
01:00:06,247 --> 01:00:09,762
We must fight the White Army

274
01:00:37,007 --> 01:00:39,601
You'll be better off in town.

275
01:00:42,087 --> 01:00:45,079
It won't be long.

276
01:00:51,847 --> 01:00:57,126
Come now, don't fret.
You'll be better off there.

277
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:59,960
Will someone come for me?

278
01:01:04,967 --> 01:01:08,755
Of course. I'll come.

279
01:01:19,007 --> 01:01:20,884
Promise me.

280
01:02:12,887 --> 01:02:15,276
You can get washed, Miss.

281
01:02:15,447 --> 01:02:18,166
From the Judge Advocate.

282
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,437
And some clothes.

283
01:03:34,207 --> 01:03:36,357
Dismissed.

284
01:03:51,007 --> 01:03:54,124
How's the food?

285
01:03:59,367 --> 01:04:01,164
How about the wine?

286
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:07,605
I agree.

287
01:04:07,767 --> 01:04:11,237
It's from Doctor Carpelan's cellar.

288
01:04:14,247 --> 01:04:16,886
What happened on the island?

289
01:04:27,927 --> 01:04:30,157
Not much.

290
01:04:31,687 --> 01:04:33,757
We froze.

291
01:04:36,727 --> 01:04:40,003
Did Jaeger Harjula treat you well?

292
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:46,126
A Finnish freedom fighter
is a gentleman.

293
01:04:47,687 --> 01:04:52,158
Did I sleep with Harjula,
is that what you want to know?

294
01:05:04,367 --> 01:05:06,597
Sit down.

295
01:05:26,607 --> 01:05:28,598
What do you think?

296
01:05:39,247 --> 01:05:41,397
Have a good look.

297
01:05:53,087 --> 01:05:55,840
You must be very lonely.

298
01:06:31,327 --> 01:06:34,205
Fine, shoot me yourself.

299
01:06:41,887 --> 01:06:44,799
Aim for the womb.

300
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:48,321
Shoot the butcher's child as well.

301
01:06:53,327 --> 01:06:55,522
Why am I still alive?

302
01:06:58,527 --> 01:07:01,963
Is it because of Jaeger Harjula?

303
01:07:02,127 --> 01:07:04,960
Mr. Hallenberg sir,
you have visitors!

304
01:07:11,687 --> 01:07:14,042
Take her away.

305
01:08:52,727 --> 01:08:57,642
Good day. I'm to visit the prisoner.
-The judge forbade visitors.

306
01:08:57,807 --> 01:09:01,846
He doesn't mean me.
-The judge forbade...

307
01:09:02,007 --> 01:09:04,646
What's the trouble here?

308
01:09:41,447 --> 01:09:43,244
Stand still.

309
01:09:48,607 --> 01:09:50,404
Good day.

310
01:09:52,167 --> 01:09:56,126
Harjula, by the devil.
I didn't think you'd come back.

311
01:09:56,287 --> 01:09:59,802
I was posted back here.
-It's good to see you.

312
01:10:07,727 --> 01:10:11,720
Aaro, isn't she beautiful?
-Very beautiful.

313
01:10:11,887 --> 01:10:16,597
It's our anniversary today.
-I decided to surprise my husband.

314
01:10:16,767 --> 01:10:19,759
Congratulations.
-I thought I married a writer -

315
01:10:19,927 --> 01:10:23,681
instead he's a vicious man
judging savages.

316
01:10:26,287 --> 01:10:29,438
This will be something
to write about, right?

317
01:10:29,607 --> 01:10:32,883
These are extraordinary times.
-Really!

318
01:10:33,047 --> 01:10:36,403
I've been bored to death
in the city.

319
01:10:37,447 --> 01:10:41,281
Misery is everywhere,
and so little beauty.

320
01:10:47,487 --> 01:10:51,685
Luckily it's beautiful here.
-Let's drink to that.

321
01:10:55,047 --> 01:10:56,799
To beauty.

322
01:11:04,127 --> 01:11:09,201
Paasonen!
Why can't I hear music?

323
01:11:29,367 --> 01:11:32,040
Vyborg was conquered.
This will soon be over.

324
01:11:32,207 --> 01:11:35,643
All prisoners have been condemned,
there's no-one alive.

325
01:11:35,807 --> 01:11:40,437
Except that woman of yours,
she's a special case.

326
01:11:44,167 --> 01:11:48,524
Did you finish questioning her?
-She's guilty.

327
01:11:48,687 --> 01:11:51,645
I have to give her
the maximum sentence.

328
01:11:52,247 --> 01:11:54,158
She has a son.

329
01:11:54,327 --> 01:11:57,683
Her name is Martta Kivelä,
not Miina Malin.

330
01:11:57,847 --> 01:12:01,726
She became a Red Guard escort girl
almost by chance.

331
01:12:01,887 --> 01:12:04,799
She whored for the cause.
-She didn't fight...

332
01:12:04,967 --> 01:12:10,200
She whored. I'm sure she was in
the female platoon of the Red Guard.

333
01:12:10,527 --> 01:12:13,485
As a commander,
out of her own free will.

334
01:12:14,207 --> 01:12:17,165
I guess you know that.

335
01:12:19,767 --> 01:12:22,440
She even offered herself to me.

336
01:12:25,807 --> 01:12:28,321
That she-wolf.

337
01:12:35,407 --> 01:12:38,160
To Finland!

338
01:12:38,607 --> 01:12:41,121
To the fatherland!

339
01:12:43,287 --> 01:12:46,359
Fly, Aaro, fly!

340
01:12:46,687 --> 01:12:53,240
You're evil, Emil. Helpless
creatures should be protected.

341
01:12:53,767 --> 01:12:59,922
What's your opinion, Jaeger Harjula?
-All God's creatures have rights.

342
01:13:00,087 --> 01:13:05,286
Jaeger Harjula is more human
than you, Emil!

343
01:13:09,247 --> 01:13:15,402
Stand up straight, guard! Don't let
the cancer of socialism infect you!

344
01:13:16,007 --> 01:13:19,397
Harjula, let's go!

345
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:34,043
That's the way it is, Aaro.
I get to do the dirty work.

346
01:13:34,167 --> 01:13:36,556
To kill these good-for-nothings.

347
01:13:36,727 --> 01:13:43,075
The big wigs in Helsinki don't even
want to hear about the executions.

348
01:13:43,567 --> 01:13:47,242
They'd rather fuck their maids
like there's no tomorrow. -Emil!

349
01:13:47,407 --> 01:13:49,204
That's the truth!

350
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:58,405
Men will do anything to get laid.
-You're coarse.

351
01:13:58,567 --> 01:14:02,526
Aaro is a soldier.
He understands.

352
01:14:03,207 --> 01:14:08,201
He's sophisticated, different,
like me.

353
01:14:11,367 --> 01:14:14,803
Emil, recite something.

354
01:14:15,927 --> 01:14:19,363
In honour of our anniversary,
or our guest.

355
01:14:28,527 --> 01:14:36,036
O who rides by night
thro' the woodland so wild?

356
01:14:38,167 --> 01:14:41,045
You're good, Emil.
-Stop it, Bea.

357
01:14:42,087 --> 01:14:46,000
You know full well
that was Goethe's verse.

358
01:14:46,167 --> 01:14:50,638
O who rides by night
thro' the woodland so wild?

359
01:14:52,367 --> 01:14:55,006
It's about you, Jaeger Harjula.

360
01:14:55,167 --> 01:14:59,479
It is the fond father
embracing his child; -

361
01:14:59,767 --> 01:15:03,043
And close the boy nestles
within his loved arm, -

362
01:15:03,207 --> 01:15:08,361
To hold himself fast,
and to keep himself warm.

363
01:15:11,887 --> 01:15:14,276
Is it about a father?

364
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:23,077
It's dialogue between a father
and his ill son.

365
01:15:23,807 --> 01:15:26,765
They ride through a forest at night.

366
01:15:27,047 --> 01:15:32,519
''My boy, upon what
dost thou fearfully gaze?''

367
01:15:33,287 --> 01:15:37,758
''O father, see yonder! see yonder!''
he says.

368
01:15:40,007 --> 01:15:45,479
In the forest, the son sees
some sort of elf king -

369
01:15:45,647 --> 01:15:48,320
that the father cannot see.

370
01:15:48,567 --> 01:15:51,559
The king wants the boy for himself.

371
01:15:59,047 --> 01:16:01,720
To the kingdom of ghosts.

372
01:16:02,567 --> 01:16:09,245
The king offers the boy his daughter
and wife to play with.

373
01:16:10,207 --> 01:16:15,281
The father rides through the night,
but his son dies.

374
01:16:31,807 --> 01:16:37,404
He joins the Elf King.
Isn't that so, Jaeger Harjula?

375
01:16:37,687 --> 01:16:39,405
Bullshit.

376
01:16:40,167 --> 01:16:43,796
Beautiful words,
feverish hallucinations.

377
01:16:45,847 --> 01:16:49,237
What kind of an author
are you, Emil?

378
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:54,963
There's not an ounce of poetry
in your soul.

379
01:16:55,127 --> 01:16:59,643
You've become a savage
among savages.

380
01:17:08,487 --> 01:17:13,800
I think that Beethoven
had that poem in mind -

381
01:17:14,167 --> 01:17:18,843
when he composed the Allegretto
of his Symphony No. 7.

382
01:17:19,007 --> 01:17:21,396
Do you know that one?

383
01:17:21,967 --> 01:17:28,406
Bea, be so kind as to play
the Allegretto of Symphony No. 7.

384
01:17:32,727 --> 01:17:38,199
I think you know this one.
I hear you play the piano very well.

385
01:17:43,327 --> 01:17:47,400
I can imagine the son
pining after the elf king.

386
01:17:47,847 --> 01:17:50,202
A masked death.

387
01:17:51,087 --> 01:17:55,842
''O, 'tis the Erl-King
with his crown and his shroud. "

388
01:17:56,167 --> 01:18:00,843
''No, my son, it is
but a dark wreath of the cloud.''

389
01:18:06,967 --> 01:18:11,961
Did you know that they play this
at childrens' funerals?

390
01:18:15,367 --> 01:18:17,403
I did.

391
01:20:50,287 --> 01:20:52,164
Take me, Aaro.

392
01:22:08,647 --> 01:22:11,798
Thank you.
-You're welcome.

393
01:22:16,327 --> 01:22:19,797
And the prisoner. What about her?

394
01:22:22,007 --> 01:22:24,202
Move.

395
01:22:28,567 --> 01:22:33,641
Come with me.
You'll be freed.

396
01:22:35,847 --> 01:22:39,283
Tell him that you're Martta Kivelä.

397
01:22:39,447 --> 01:22:42,405
You were an escort girl
in the Red Guard -

398
01:22:42,567 --> 01:22:45,400
but you weren't
involved in fighting.

399
01:22:45,567 --> 01:22:48,798
And you have a son
who misses his mother.

400
01:23:00,647 --> 01:23:06,404
Jaeger Harjula tells me that you're
not Miina Malin, but Martta Kivelä.

401
01:23:07,367 --> 01:23:11,963
He also thinks
that you should be set free.

402
01:23:12,287 --> 01:23:15,245
To take care of your fatherless son.

403
01:23:16,647 --> 01:23:20,799
Are you Martta Kivelä?

404
01:23:25,607 --> 01:23:27,359
Are you?

405
01:23:29,847 --> 01:23:34,398
Miina Malin.
-No. She's Martta Kivelä.

406
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:36,406
Martta Kivelä!

407
01:23:40,087 --> 01:23:45,241
Miina Malin of the Red Guard.
You're guilty of military action -

408
01:23:45,407 --> 01:23:47,921
as leader of a female platoon.

409
01:23:48,087 --> 01:23:50,760
You have murdered civilians
and civil guards.

410
01:23:50,927 --> 01:23:55,159
According to Finnish martial law,
I sentence you to death.

411
01:23:55,327 --> 01:23:58,205
The sentence will be carried out
tomorrow.

412
01:24:04,327 --> 01:24:09,401
This case is closed.
Take the prisoner away.

413
01:24:11,447 --> 01:24:15,201
Paasonen, you may leave.
Take the men with you.

414
01:24:27,047 --> 01:24:33,361
Aaro, future generations
will remember us as heroes.

415
01:24:46,527 --> 01:24:51,123
Tell me you didn't really think
I'd pardon her.

416
01:24:55,087 --> 01:24:59,603
Your superior, Lieutenant Manner
told me on the phone -

417
01:25:00,047 --> 01:25:03,244
that you haven't
reported back to your unit.

418
01:25:03,407 --> 01:25:06,205
That you're a wanted man.

419
01:25:07,847 --> 01:25:13,126
And that those women weren't raped.
They wanted it.

420
01:25:14,127 --> 01:25:19,042
That woman of yours copulates
like a beast, she doesn't know love.

421
01:25:19,207 --> 01:25:23,280
Right, Aaro?
-If you say so.

422
01:25:24,887 --> 01:25:30,086
I'm not a monster.
I'll let you say goodbye to her.

423
01:25:51,527 --> 01:25:54,519
Why didn't you defend yourself?

424
01:25:56,767 --> 01:26:01,761
Martta is dead and her son needs
a mother. You could have survived.

425
01:26:12,767 --> 01:26:15,281
He sees us.

426
01:26:15,527 --> 01:26:19,600
He wants you. Fullfill your promise.
Get me out of here.

427
01:26:33,287 --> 01:26:35,084
Emil.

428
01:26:41,607 --> 01:26:44,075
You can go home.

429
01:26:52,887 --> 01:26:55,117
I feel like dancing.

430
01:27:09,927 --> 01:27:13,681
Did you enjoy my wife's company?

431
01:27:14,367 --> 01:27:16,278
Did you?

432
01:27:21,767 --> 01:27:24,918
I don't much enjoy her company.

433
01:27:27,047 --> 01:27:30,517
I think she's more your type.

434
01:27:34,767 --> 01:27:37,361
What about that prisoner of yours?

435
01:27:39,567 --> 01:27:44,243
Is she your type?
-How do you mean?

436
01:27:46,247 --> 01:27:49,398
Tell me something.
-What?

437
01:27:51,127 --> 01:27:56,679
Do you promise to tell me the truth?
No tales.

438
01:28:00,487 --> 01:28:02,921
Just the truth.

439
01:28:05,607 --> 01:28:07,757
I promise.

440
01:28:08,207 --> 01:28:12,280
Did you and that Malin...

441
01:28:13,607 --> 01:28:16,599
Or whatever her name is...

442
01:28:16,847 --> 01:28:21,716
Did you two fornicate
on that island?

443
01:28:23,647 --> 01:28:25,797
No.

444
01:28:27,447 --> 01:28:30,405
I didn't touch that woman.

445
01:28:32,287 --> 01:28:34,517
I knew it, Aaro.

446
01:28:36,167 --> 01:28:39,637
You're different, just like I am.

447
01:28:41,647 --> 01:28:44,923
We're special. -Yes.

448
01:28:48,087 --> 01:28:49,918
Aaro.

449
01:28:53,127 --> 01:28:59,999
Will you dance with me?
Like two soldiers dance together.

450
01:30:05,727 --> 01:30:09,356
Do you ask clemency
for your prisoner?

451
01:30:11,447 --> 01:30:13,358
I do.

452
01:30:17,487 --> 01:30:21,036
You want to free the she-wolf.

453
01:30:27,087 --> 01:30:29,282
Aaro.

454
01:30:30,447 --> 01:30:34,156
In that case,
will you grant one wish for me?

455
01:30:35,727 --> 01:30:38,241
I will.

456
01:30:40,127 --> 01:30:43,005
You're a good soldier.

457
01:30:48,567 --> 01:30:51,240
What's your wish?

458
01:30:54,927 --> 01:30:58,158
Will you lie next to me tonight?

459
01:30:58,407 --> 01:31:02,400
But not as two soldiers would lie.

460
01:33:20,767 --> 01:33:25,124
You will do your duty, won't you?
-I will.

461
01:33:32,967 --> 01:33:37,438
You will be back, won't you?
-I will.

462
01:34:00,247 --> 01:34:02,124
Get up.

463
01:34:13,727 --> 01:34:19,199
Water, water. Water, water!

464
01:34:22,287 --> 01:34:24,357
Water, water!

465
01:34:52,447 --> 01:34:54,802
Water, water!

466
01:34:56,727 --> 01:34:59,002
Go and get Jaeger Harjula.
-Water, water!

467
01:35:00,367 --> 01:35:02,801
Harjula!

468
01:35:03,367 --> 01:35:06,404
Jaeger Harjula
took the prisoner and...

469
01:35:16,247 --> 01:35:17,965
Wait.

470
01:35:29,927 --> 01:35:31,997
Hold this.

471
01:36:04,127 --> 01:36:08,040
Just in case.
Put it on if you need to.

472
01:36:16,727 --> 01:36:19,195
Come with me.

473
01:36:20,887 --> 01:36:24,436
Would we be good together?

474
01:37:01,527 --> 01:37:03,802
Go. Go.

475
01:37:09,647 --> 01:37:13,606
Harjula! God damn you!
You're letting the prisoner escape!

476
01:37:13,767 --> 01:37:15,883
She's been set free.
-Liar!

477
01:37:16,047 --> 01:37:18,800
Hallenberg pardoned her.

478
01:37:21,607 --> 01:37:23,643
Judge Hallenberg pardoned her.

479
01:37:23,807 --> 01:37:27,595
Jaeger Harjula seems to have taken
the law into his own hands.

480
01:37:30,287 --> 01:37:34,917
That woman won't be shot.
She's been set free. -Liar!

481
01:37:41,567 --> 01:37:42,841
Alright, so we won't shoot.

482
01:39:06,527 --> 01:39:11,806
Judge, this gun belongs to you.

483
01:39:15,967 --> 01:39:21,041
The Red got away, but I'm sure
she's been caught by now.

484
01:40:28,167 --> 01:40:30,203
Konsta.

485
01:41:08,207 --> 01:41:15,557
Finland, my home country so lovely
The dearest of them all

486
01:41:16,607 --> 01:41:24,287
Where the white-crowned trees
Surround the meadows so green

487
01:41:24,967 --> 01:41:32,726
Where the white-crowned trees
Surround the meadows so green

488
01:41:34,007 --> 01:41:42,119
That is where I heard the birds sing
For the first time in my life

489
01:41:42,767 --> 01:41:47,557
That is where my mother
Rocked my cradle

490
01:41:47,727 --> 01:41:51,117
With a loving smile

491
01:42:00,887 --> 01:42:02,764
Hands.

492
01:42:10,207 --> 01:42:12,118
Come here.

493
01:42:13,807 --> 01:42:15,525
Come now.

494
01:42:16,167 --> 01:42:19,876
You didn't tell me you have an aunt.

495
01:42:23,447 --> 01:42:26,359
It's wonderful to see you, Eino.

496
01:42:27,087 --> 01:42:29,885
Now you get to go home with me.

497
01:42:30,247 --> 01:42:33,159
A terrible tragedy,
what happened to Hallenberg.

498
01:42:33,327 --> 01:42:37,115
We lost a great author.
How well did you know him?

499
01:42:38,287 --> 01:42:40,039
Very well.

500
01:42:40,767 --> 01:42:42,758
That's what I thought.

501
01:42:43,887 --> 01:42:48,722
I feel sorry for his widow.
I hear she's pregnant too.

502
01:42:53,607 --> 01:42:55,598
You've grown so much.

503
01:42:59,327 --> 01:43:01,966
Do you remember your aunt, Eino?

504
01:43:05,487 --> 01:43:07,443
Do you?

505
01:43:17,967 --> 01:43:20,083
My name is Miina.

506
01:43:20,647 --> 01:43:24,640
You're not my aunt.
-No, I'm not.

507
01:43:25,047 --> 01:43:28,596
I guess we fooled them proper.

508
01:43:29,447 --> 01:43:33,804
Can I call you Eikka?
-Can I call you mother?

509
01:49:00,727 --> 01:49:04,037
