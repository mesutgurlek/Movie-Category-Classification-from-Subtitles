who died in the Valley of Death

00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:13,804
Maybe in June of 1954,

when the Army first realised a new kind
of war was coming its way.

The Sioux raised their children that way.

and all of us are new to this post,

194
00:19:36,788 --> 00:19:41,200
so I thought we could pool our resources
and cover whatever questions we might have.

195
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,293
Why don't we start
with item number one - food?

196
00:19:44,462 --> 00:19:48,460
If the commissary is out of something,
where's the best place to shop?

197
00:19:49,092 --> 00:19:51,333
I tried Big Star and it's OK.

198
00:19:51,510 --> 00:19:55,590

at the check-out aisle!

That takes care of food shopping.
So item number two - laundry.

200
00:20:01,979 --> 00:20:05,846
The washing machines don't work.
They're full of sand.

201
00:20:06,025 --> 00:20:08,480
- I'll take care of that.
- I've complained.

Well, we'll just go to the General.

203
00:20:11,946 --> 00:20:17,071
The laundromat in town's OK, but they
won't let you wash coloured things.

204
00:20:17,243 --> 00:20:19,995
- In a public laundromat?
- It doesn't make sense,

205
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:23,413
but they have a sign in the window saying
"Whites Only".

206
00:20:26,961 --> 00:20:30,330
- What?
- Honey, they mean white people only.

207
00:20:32,634 --> 00:20:37,627
That's awful. Your husband is wearing
the uniform of a country that allows a place

when he could die for...

- That's all right, honey.

00:20:50,692 --> 00:20:54,477
I know what my husband's fighting for
and that's why I can smile.

211
00:20:54,654 --> 00:20:57,062
My husband will never ask for respect,

212
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:00,609
and he'll give respect to no man
who hasn't earned it.

The rest of his family's the same way.

anyway.

Don't you take that off. That's an order.

will ask for protection and for victory.

00:54:36,303 --> 00:54:38,591
There's close to a hundred more, sir!

467
00:54:46,771 --> 00:54:49,642
They're right on top of us, sir!
Bring it in close!

468
00:55:53,418 --> 00:55:57,250
It's a hot LZ. We'll be jumping.
We will not touch down!

469
00:56:10,393 --> 00:56:15,102
They're trying to break right through us.
I want you to reinforce Alpha Company there.

470
00:56:15,273 --> 00:56:19,222
Yes, sir! Follow me!
Charlie Company up on the ridge!

471
00:56:19,402 --> 00:56:23,019
Doc, the wounded
are over by that termite mound. Go!

472
00:56:23,197 --> 00:56:28,357
If you don't find some cover, you'll go down.
If you go down, we all go down. Come on!

473
00:56:43,549 --> 00:56:45,044
Cobain!

474
00:56:45,218 --> 00:56:47,755
I want the M-60 right here!

475
00:56:55,395 --> 00:56:57,054
Radio!

476
00:56:59,273 --> 00:57:01,978
Sir, it's Captain Edwards on the ridge, sir!

477
00:57:02,777 --> 00:57:05,445
- Bob.
- Colonel, these guys are regulars.

478
00:57:05,612 --> 00:57:09,148
Heavily armed.
AK-47s and pouches of grenades!

479
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:12,326
Heavy machine-guns
and shoulder-fired rockets!

480
00:57:30,470 --> 00:57:33,921
Captain Nadal. That creek bed is vital.

481
00:57:34,099 --> 00:57:38,048
Vital! Now, they'll be coming right at you.
Do not let them flank.

482
00:57:38,227 --> 00:57:40,303
(RADlO) I repeat, do not let them flank!

483
00:57:40,855 --> 00:57:43,311
Secure the creek bed!

484
00:57:59,915 --> 00:58:02,832
Tom, keep trying to raise
those Medevac boys.

485
00:58:12,886 --> 00:58:15,127
Tom? Tom?

486
00:58:15,763 --> 00:58:19,048
- I'm all right.
- Charlie, come here.

487
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:24,311
I want you to get me all the air support
you can get me on that mountain. Now!

488
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:28,560
Requesting immediate air support.
I need you to burn them out on hill top.

489
00:58:28,734 --> 00:58:35,448
Alpha, shift to Alpha Bravo.
Co-ordinates - Golf 4-5-2...

490
00:58:51,339 --> 00:58:58,088
- Give me something higher up!
- Shifting to hilltop, Bravo. Golf 4-5-7-2.

491
00:58:59,472 --> 00:59:02,887
I'll say again. 4-5-7-2.

492
00:59:14,487 --> 00:59:19,907
- Medevac Commander, are you inbound?
- Looks pretty hot down there.

493
00:59:20,075 --> 00:59:23,491
Yeah. You can make it.
Watch our approach. Follow us in.

494
00:59:23,662 --> 00:59:26,995
Copy that, Seventh Cav.
We will follow your approach.

495
00:59:45,808 --> 00:59:48,216
Get over there. Reinforce Charlie Company.

496
00:59:54,816 --> 00:59:58,861
The Medevac guys are bugging out
and leaving the wounded!

497
01:00:12,166 --> 01:00:15,084
- Snake, get out of here!
- Bring in the wounded!

498
01:00:15,253 --> 01:00:16,830
Get the wounded!

499
01:00:17,004 --> 01:00:18,713
Come on! Come on!

500
01:00:24,053 --> 01:00:28,680
Come here. They're still trying to flank us.
Stretch out along the line.

501
01:00:33,312 --> 01:00:34,854
Radio!

502
01:00:38,149 --> 01:00:42,895
Trojan Six, we're in heavy contact.
In danger of being overrun!

503
01:00:43,071 --> 01:00:45,278
If they get the LZ, we've had it. Can you hold?

504
01:00:45,449 --> 01:00:47,856
We're spread thin, sir, but we'll give 'em hell.

505
01:00:48,034 --> 01:00:50,490
(WHISTLES BLOW)

506
01:00:55,666 --> 01:01:00,162
Crandall, this is Troajan Six. It's too hot
down here. I'm closing the LZ.

507
01:01:00,338 --> 01:01:03,541
- You copy that, Too Tall?
- Copy that, Snake.

508
01:01:03,717 --> 01:01:06,670
All Seventh Cavalry units,
LZ X-Ray is closed.

509
01:01:06,844 --> 01:01:11,471
- I don't li ke it. A whole battalion massacred.
- You think this is a massacre?

510
01:01:11,641 --> 01:01:15,424
Losing a lot of draftees is a bad week.
Losing a colonel is a massacre.

511
01:01:15,603 --> 01:01:17,262
Moore is still fighting.

512
01:01:17,437 --> 01:01:20,723
He's against more men than he can count.
A platoon is lost.

513
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:24,103
They're not lost.
They're cut off and surrounded.

514
01:01:26,988 --> 01:01:28,898
Then they're lost.

515
01:01:29,074 --> 01:01:31,280
- Sergeant Major!
- Sir!

516
01:01:33,537 --> 01:01:36,905
We need to carve out an emergency LZ
right over there.

517
01:01:37,082 --> 01:01:38,908
- Sir.
- Blow the trees down.

518
01:01:48,342 --> 01:01:50,382
Fire in the hole!

519
01:01:56,224 --> 01:01:58,383
Colonel, this is Snakeshit and Too Tall.

520
01:01:58,561 --> 01:02:02,475
- We're coming in with two loads of ammo.
- We've blown a new LZ.

521
01:02:02,648 --> 01:02:05,138
Come in from the east. Out.

522
01:02:09,445 --> 01:02:12,364
It's Brigade Headquarters, they want you out.

523
01:02:12,533 --> 01:02:15,616
- We can't get out, damnit!
- Not all of us, just you.

524
01:02:15,785 --> 01:02:17,943
Saigon wants to debrief you.

525
01:02:18,329 --> 01:02:20,369
That doesn't make any sense.

526
01:02:20,540 --> 01:02:22,947
Say again. Will you repeat that order?

527
01:02:28,256 --> 01:02:31,291
Too Tall, follow the Colonel to the new LZ.

528
01:02:31,467 --> 01:02:33,590
I see him, Snake.

529
01:02:38,724 --> 01:02:41,262
Let's go! Move!

530
01:02:45,188 --> 01:02:46,813
Shit!

531
01:02:46,982 --> 01:02:49,307
Come on, we'll give you a hand.

532
01:02:49,484 --> 01:02:53,398
All right, get that ammo off
and get the wounded on!

533
01:02:53,571 --> 01:02:55,979
Bring them on. Get them on, boys.

534
01:03:02,705 --> 01:03:05,113
No, no! We're overloaded. Leave him.

535
01:03:05,292 --> 01:03:08,625
No. I'll get out. It's Ray.
He's hurt worse than me.

536
01:03:10,004 --> 01:03:12,542
You hang on. I'll see you back there, Ray.

537
01:03:27,812 --> 01:03:30,304
(AGONISED SCREAMING)

538
01:03:37,697 --> 01:03:40,188
You, me and Oulette are all we have
in reserve.

539
01:03:40,366 --> 01:03:42,608
Yeah. We're slacking up a little.

540
01:03:42,786 --> 01:03:45,620
No. We're just regrouping for another assault.

541
01:03:46,706 --> 01:03:48,746
Distribute that ammo.

542
01:03:48,916 --> 01:03:50,375
- Oulette!
- Sir.

543
01:03:50,543 --> 01:03:53,793
Tell Crandall he's got time
for one more flight in here.

544
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,754
Agent Serpent, this is Trojan Six...

545
01:03:57,925 --> 01:04:00,498
Doc, get this water to the wounded.

546
01:04:02,345 --> 01:04:05,513
Everybody's out of water.
It must be terrible for them.

547
01:04:06,433 --> 01:04:08,805
And those guys are cut off out there.

548
01:04:14,483 --> 01:04:19,523
- Running low on ammo, Sarge!
- Pick your target. One shot, one kill. OK?

549
01:04:19,695 --> 01:04:22,269
- Roger that, Sarge.
- How are we doing, Doc?

550
01:04:22,449 --> 01:04:27,360
- Ernie, we're out of water.
- That's the last of it.

551
01:04:42,384 --> 01:04:46,761
- My face is on fire!
- Phosphorus! Hold still! Hold still!

552
01:04:46,930 --> 01:04:49,765
Don't touch your face. Hold still.

553
01:05:03,112 --> 01:05:06,482
- Doc! Doc! It's phosphorus.
- OK.

554
01:05:08,534 --> 01:05:10,907
Does anybody have any more bandages?!

555
01:05:26,009 --> 01:05:27,552
Ernie!

556
01:05:27,720 --> 01:05:30,969
- Ernie, you hit too? You hit?
- No. I'm OK.

557
01:05:31,139 --> 01:05:33,297
Our guys are gonna come for us?

558
01:05:35,894 --> 01:05:38,848
- Yeah.
- When?

559
01:05:40,691 --> 01:05:42,564
Plug his wound.

560
01:05:45,320 --> 01:05:48,237
That's the main LZ, but it's closed.

561
01:06:04,546 --> 01:06:06,504
This is Too Tall. I'm clear.

562
01:06:06,674 --> 01:06:08,915
Crandall's clear.

563
01:06:14,431 --> 01:06:15,926
- Colonel.
- Geoghegan.

564
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:19,599
I want you to go and reinforce the company
on that ridge.

565
01:06:19,770 --> 01:06:22,177
- Yes, sir!
- OK. Keep your head down.

566
01:06:24,566 --> 01:06:26,891
To the top of the ridge! Move it!

567
01:06:40,122 --> 01:06:44,202
Captain Nadal? We've got to break through
to that cut-off platoon.

568
01:06:45,211 --> 01:06:47,618
We got an American platoon out there.

569
01:06:47,796 --> 01:06:51,081
We've got an Air Cav platoon cut off
out there!

570
01:06:51,257 --> 01:06:54,841
Air Cav! Air Cav! Going over!

571
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:17,528
I said, "I know. Your mom asked me
to give you $600!"

572
01:07:20,369 --> 01:07:22,445
Good luck to you.

573
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:31,912
- You got enough room for one more?
- If you're crazy enough, get in.

574
01:07:32,089 --> 01:07:33,998
Yes, sir.

575
01:07:49,939 --> 01:07:52,512
Hey, what are those lights down there?

576
01:07:52,692 --> 01:07:57,437
Enemy soldiers.
They use candles on the trail.

577
01:07:57,613 --> 01:08:00,898
They're moving into position to attack.

578
01:08:01,575 --> 01:08:03,901
(BULLETS PING)

579
01:08:04,078 --> 01:08:06,319
Here we go!

580
01:08:27,892 --> 01:08:32,803
Help them unload that shit!
OK, let's go! Let's go!

581
01:08:38,027 --> 01:08:40,897
Your boys have done a helluva job
today, Snake.

582
01:08:41,071 --> 01:08:46,066
That's the last flight for tonight, Colonel,
but you need us, you call us.

583
01:08:50,038 --> 01:08:52,909
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm a reporter, sir.

584
01:08:53,917 --> 01:08:57,617
- Hell.
- Joe Galloway, UPI. How's it going, sir?

585
01:08:57,796 --> 01:09:01,165
We've been flat to the boards.
We're greatly outnumbered.

586
01:09:02,676 --> 01:09:06,127
We got more enemy coming, sir.
Saw a chain of lights coming in.

587
01:09:06,304 --> 01:09:08,096
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir.

588
01:09:08,265 --> 01:09:11,847
- Well, I can't guarantee your safety.
- Yes, sir. I know.

589
01:09:12,018 --> 01:09:15,434
- Where are you from, son?
- Rufugio, Texas, sir.

590
01:09:16,063 --> 01:09:19,562
That's the first thing I heard all day
that makes any sense.

591
01:09:19,733 --> 01:09:21,193
- Captain Dillon!
- Sir!

592
01:09:21,360 --> 01:09:24,195
- Did you see those lights?
- We're on it now, sir.

593
01:09:24,363 --> 01:09:27,862
- You fry those sons-of-bitches.
- This is Trojan Three.

594
01:09:28,033 --> 01:09:32,410
Fire emissions. Tango Foxtrot 4-9-6-5-6-9.

595
01:09:32,579 --> 01:09:34,738
Repeat, Tango Foxtrot...

596
01:09:38,961 --> 01:09:42,579
(TANNOY) All operations are suspended
for the evening.

597
01:09:42,756 --> 01:09:46,089
Morning operations are scheduled
for 0530 hours.

598
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:20,368
- Where's Crandall?
- He's right there, sir.

599
01:10:20,542 --> 01:10:25,370
- Crandall! You led my men into a hot LZ.
- Somebody had to fly out the wounded.

600
01:10:25,547 --> 01:10:29,675
Don't you play hotshot with me!
You suckered us in there.

601
01:10:29,843 --> 01:10:31,966
Do it again, I'll have you busted!

602
01:10:32,137 --> 01:10:35,137
You got the balls to face me,
but not the enemy!

603
01:10:35,306 --> 01:10:37,133
Whoa! Hey! Whoa!

604
01:10:38,309 --> 01:10:40,931
If I ever see you again, I'll kill you.

605
01:10:44,816 --> 01:10:46,689
That's right.

606
01:10:47,526 --> 01:10:49,353
Hey.

607
01:10:54,699 --> 01:10:56,823
What a day, huh?

608
01:11:02,499 --> 01:11:04,575
Tomorrow will be worse.

609
01:11:07,211 --> 01:11:09,454
If they make it to tomorrow.

610
01:11:12,258 --> 01:11:15,094
(SILENCE)

611
01:11:19,766 --> 01:11:22,470
(WHISPERS) Ernie, I can smell them.

612
01:11:23,728 --> 01:11:26,515
- Dead bodies stink.
- It's not the dead ones.

613
01:11:26,689 --> 01:11:31,066
I can smell them crawling up on us.
I'm telling you.

614
01:11:36,365 --> 01:11:41,572
I need illumination. 6-5-0-1-5-0-1.

615
01:11:47,459 --> 01:11:49,582
(ROCKET ROARS)

616

Two of my great grand-daddies were soldiers.
Hell, that's how I came to be.

and my great grand-daddy Reid lost his right.

They met in a shoe store in Galveston.

692

Every year after that, the same date,
the same store,

693
01:22:45,215 --> 01:22:48,382
they'd get together
and pick out a new pair of shoes.

- No, sir. I swear to God.

my grandparents.

I didn't think I could stop the war.

I just thought maybe I might try
and understand one.

702
01:23:25,129 --> 01:23:28,295
Maybe help the folks back home understand.

shooting a camera than shooting a rifle.

02:08:16,002 --> 02:08:18,754
- Kids, go to bed.
- Someone's at the door.

931
02:08:18,922 --> 02:08:20,914
Go to bed!

932
02:09:01,254 --> 02:09:03,828
Children! Your daddy's home!

933
02:09:04,007 --> 02:09:06,295
Daddy! Daddy!

934
02:09:10,554 --> 02:09:13,009
Some had families waiting...

935
02:09:13,515 --> 02:09:17,560
for others, their only family would be the men
they had bled beside.

936
02:09:17,728 --> 02:09:23,268
There were no bands, no flags,
no armed guards to welcome them home.

937
02:09:25,277 --> 02:09:28,728
They went to war because their country
ordered them to,

938
02:09:28,906 --> 02:09:33,033
but, in the end, they fought
not for their country or their flag.

939
02:09:33,201 --> 02:09:35,443
They fought for each other.

940
02:09:39,040 --> 02:09:41,116
(MOORE) "Dear Barbara,

941
02:09:41,292 --> 02:09:46,203
"l have no words to express to you
my sadness at the loss of Jack.

942
02:09:47,632 --> 02:09:53,717
"The world is a lesser place without him.
But I know he is with God and the angels,

943
02:09:53,888 --> 02:09:57,802
"and even Heaven is improved
by his presence there.

944
02:09:58,684 --> 02:10:01,435
"l know you too are sure of this,

945
02:10:01,603 --> 02:10:06,229
"and yet this knowledge can 't diminish
his loss and your grief.

946
02:10:07,693 --> 02:10:11,311
"With abiding respect and affection,
Hal Moore. "

947
02:10:24,167 --> 02:10:28,627
(GALLOWA Y) We who have seen war
never stop seeing it.

948
02:10:31,382 --> 02:10:35,297
In the silence of the night,
we will always hear the screams.

949
02:10:39,307 --> 02:10:41,548
So this is our story.

950
02:10:43,060 --> 02:10:46,511
For we were soldiers once...and young.

951
02:11:51,834 --> 02:12:02,926
(CHOI R) # To fallen soldiers let us sing

952
02:12:03,720 --> 02:12:15,856
# Where no rockets fly nor bullets wing

953
02:12:16,191 --> 02:12:26,405
# Our broken brothers let us bring

954
02:12:26,576 --> 02:12:36,742
# To the Mansions of the Lord

955
02:12:38,420 --> 02:12:49,133
# No more bleeding, no more fight

956
02:12:50,640 --> 02:13:01,435
# No prayers pleading through the night

957
02:13:01,610 --> 02:13:11,905
# Just divine embrace, eternal light

958
02:13:12,536 --> 02:13:22,204
# In the Mansions of the Lord

959
02:13:22,630 --> 02:13:34,255
# Where no mothers cry
and no children weep

960
02:13:34,891 --> 02:13:46,813
# We shall stand and guard
though the angels sleep

961
02:13:47,236 --> 02:13:57,320
# While through the ages safely keep

962
02:13:57,872 --> 02:14:07,707
# The Mansions of the Lord #

963

(MOURNFUL SCOTTISH FOLK SONG)
