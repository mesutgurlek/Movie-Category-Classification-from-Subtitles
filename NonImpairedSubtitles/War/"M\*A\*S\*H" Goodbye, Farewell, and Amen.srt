00:38:08,784 --> 00:38:10,305
What happened next?

581
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:13,345

<i>[Clucking Stops]</i>

583
00:38:20,946 --> 00:38:24,386
There's something wrong with it.
It stopped making noise.

584
00:38:24,466 --> 00:38:27,707
[Breathing Heavily]
It just... just stopped.

585
00:38:30,227 --> 00:38:34,267
<i>[Quiet Crying]</i>

586
00:38:38,548 --> 00:38:42,308
Sh... She killed it!
She killed it!

587
00:38:42,388 --> 00:38:44,109
She killed the chicken?

588
00:38:48,629 --> 00:38:50,869
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

589
00:38:57,230 --> 00:38:59,950
[Sobbing]
I didn't mean for her to kill it.

590
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:03,311
<i>[Sobbing Continues]
I did not!</i>

591
00:39:03,391 --> 00:39:07,631
I... I just wanted it
to be quiet!

592
00:39:07,711 --> 00:39:10,832
It was...
It was a baby!

593
00:39:10,952 --> 00:39:14,272
She... She smothered
her own baby!

594
00:39:14,392 --> 00:39:16,352
<i>[Panting]</i>

595
00:39:22,713 --> 00:39:25,753
You son of a bitch.
Why did you make me remember that?

596
00:39:25,873 --> 00:39:29,514
You had to get it
out in the open.

597
00:39:29,594 --> 00:39:31,714
Now we're halfway home.

598
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:44,596
And then I started thinking.
It's like my Uncle Jameel used to say:

599
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:47,316
If you wanna hide in the desert,
you gotta look like sand.

600
00:39:47,436 --> 00:39:51,036
I was already asleep. I don't need to hear
a bunch of Lebanese fairy tales.

601
00:39:51,156 --> 00:39:54,197
Sorry to wake you, Colonel, but we could
only do this under the cover of darkness.

602
00:39:54,317 --> 00:39:58,357
Wait a minute, what's this tent doing here
where the... tank used to be?

603
00:39:58,477 --> 00:40:01,798
And to make extra sure,
there's a big red cross on the roof too.

604
00:40:01,918 --> 00:40:04,318
You know, we may just
fool 'em with this.

605
00:40:04,438 --> 00:40:08,839
It's an old Bedouin trick. Back in the old
country, my Uncle Jameel was a camel rustler.

606
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:16,119
[Thinking] Dear Dad. Sorry I haven't
written for a while...

607
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:18,840
but I've been on R & R
at this wonderful resort.

608
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,920
We're planning to have
a bridge tournament here...

609
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,560
as soon as we can find somebody
with a full deck.

610
00:40:28,321 --> 00:40:30,121
Dear Dad.

611
00:40:30,241 --> 00:40:32,041
Remember when I was a kid,
you always told me...

612
00:40:32,161 --> 00:40:34,042
if my head wasn't attached
to my shoulders, I'd lose it?

613
00:40:34,122 --> 00:40:36,002
Well...

614
00:40:39,362 --> 00:40:43,363
Dear Dad. For the first time,
I understand what a nervous disorder is...

615
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:45,363
because it seems
I've got one.

616
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,603
I guess I'll be seeing you soon
since I doubt if they'll let a surgeon operate...

617
00:40:48,723 --> 00:40:51,084
whose cheese has
slipped off his cracker.

618
00:40:52,604 --> 00:40:56,444
- Time to hit the couch?
- Actually, it may be time to hit the road.

619
00:40:56,564 --> 00:40:59,165
How would you feel
about moving on?

620
00:40:59,285 --> 00:41:02,845
You just have the bellhop
bring me my pants, I'll be on my way.

621
00:41:02,925 --> 00:41:05,725
Sidney, it's been a pleasure.
Soon as I get back to Maine...

622
00:41:05,845 --> 00:41:08,726
I'm gonna have a memorial
lobster in your honor, cracked, of course.

623
00:41:09,926 --> 00:41:11,806
How about a little hug
for the road?

624
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:16,127
I hate to break this to you, but you're not
going home. You're going back to the 4077.

625
00:41:17,847 --> 00:41:19,807
Does this mean
I'm not getting the hug?

626
00:41:19,927 --> 00:41:22,847
You're sending a crazy man back to the place
where he got crazy in the first place?

627
00:41:22,967 --> 00:41:26,448
- Are you out of your mind?
- Look, you know, when a soldier
reacts to the stress of combat...

628
00:41:26,568 --> 00:41:28,848
we get him back to his foxhole
as soon as we can.

629
00:41:28,968 --> 00:41:32,208
We have to get you
right back to the O.R.

630
00:41:32,328 --> 00:41:35,089
Listen, a couple of days ago,
I fell all to pieces in there.

631
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:39,929
- I thought we had to have more sessions.
- We've had them.

632
00:41:40,009 --> 00:41:41,890
So now you're just
dumping me back there again?

633
00:41:41,970 --> 00:41:45,570
Well, I'm going to drop in on you from time
to time, see how you're doing.

634
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:50,331
Why don't we compromise? Send me to a foxhole
in Crabapple Cove. You can drop in on me there.

635
00:41:50,411 --> 00:41:53,731
I'm afraid of lobsters.

636
00:41:53,811 --> 00:41:56,451
I'll have the bellhop
bring you your pants.

637
00:42:08,213 --> 00:42:11,293
[Engine Stops]

638
00:42:14,413 --> 00:42:18,534
Hi. Uh, g-good morning. I wonder if I could
lighten your mailbag by one letter.

639
00:42:18,654 --> 00:42:20,534
The name is Winchester,
Charles E.

640
00:42:20,654 --> 00:42:24,575
Sorry, Major. Nobody opens this sack
till I get a receipt from your company clerk.

641
00:42:24,655 --> 00:42:27,455
Oh, now, well, see,
this is a letter from a hospital.

642
00:42:27,535 --> 00:42:29,855
I don't care if it's from Dr. Pepper.
I need a receipt.

643
00:42:29,935 --> 00:42:32,096
<i>[Chuckles]
Dr... Pepper.</i>

644
00:42:32,176 --> 00:42:35,816
Uh-huh. I can get you on a flight
out ofTokyo to Guam.

645
00:42:35,896 --> 00:42:37,736
From there,
a steamer to Seattle.

646
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:40,937
Can you get me to Honolulu?
I can hitch a flight from there to San Francisco.

647
00:42:41,017 --> 00:42:45,097
What about that boat from,
uh, Okinawa to Honolulu?

648
00:42:45,177 --> 00:42:50,818
Yeah? Yeah? Kimpo, Okinawa,
Honolulu, San Francisco.

649
00:42:50,898 --> 00:42:53,098
That's it! That's it!
That's the one I want!

650
00:42:53,178 --> 00:42:55,298
But the plane leaves
Kimpo in 40 minutes.

651
00:42:55,378 --> 00:42:57,218
- Got anything else?
- Oh, come on! What is this?

652
00:42:57,299 --> 00:42:59,859
<i>- [Klinger] I don't care! Be creative!
- There is your company clerk.</i>

653
00:42:59,979 --> 00:43:01,779
- Now can I please have my mail?
- Sign here.

654
00:43:01,899 --> 00:43:03,939
- One second. One second.
- Can you get me to Midway?

655
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:05,900
Wait a minute.
I'm still working on Honolulu.

656
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,020
Sergeant, come on.
I'm due in Kimpo in 20 minutes.

657
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:10,020
Kimpo? Wait a minute.
You got room for a passenger?

658
00:43:10,140 --> 00:43:12,260
Yeah, I got room,
but I gotta leave right away.

659
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,821
- You give me 10 minutes,
I'll meet you on the chopper pad.
- Five.

660
00:43:14,941 --> 00:43:16,621
- You got it. Klinger?
- You got it. Kimpo.

661
00:43:16,741 --> 00:43:21,101
- Klinger, sign.
- Corporal, get me that flight from Kimpo.

662
00:43:21,221 --> 00:43:23,142
- Thank you.

This is the only connection I could get.

666
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:34,383
Oh, what the heck.

667
00:43:34,463 --> 00:43:37,063
Send me a piece
of birthday cake.

Thank you.

669
00:43:39,223 --> 00:43:43,984

- Go! You're fighting the clock.

670
00:43:44,064 --> 00:43:47,945
- Captain, you're on the flight.
I even got you a window seat.
- Oh, Klinger, you're...

671
00:43:48,065 --> 00:43:50,225
- I'm really gonna...
- That's how I feel, sir.

Captain, I'm leaving here at
10 after with or without you.

00:43:52,825 --> 00:43:55,065
- Whoo-hoo!
- I gotta leave a note for Hawkeye.

674
00:43:55,185 --> 00:43:57,626
- Give me a piece of paper and a pencil. Charles...
- [Mumbling]

- Charles...
- Here you are, sir. Better hurry.

676
00:43:59,666 --> 00:44:04,066
I got the job! Someone on the board
gave me a rousing endorsement.

677
00:44:04,186 --> 00:44:07,267
- Charles, I've got to go.
- Fine, fine. Yes, you do that.

Here, uh, throw some of
this stuff in that suitcase for me, will ya?

00:44:36,990 --> 00:44:38,911
Get everything in that bag
that you can.

689
00:44:39,031 --> 00:44:40,911
I'll try not to
wrinkle your shorts.

690
00:44:41,031 --> 00:44:42,911
You're leaving
and you didn't say good-bye?

691
00:44:43,031 --> 00:44:44,911
Well, you know how
insensitive I can be.

692
00:44:44,991 --> 00:44:50,432
Hunnicutt, when people share a tent for such
a long time, they can become quite close.

693
00:44:50,552 --> 00:44:53,032
Of course, that didn't
happen in our case.

694
00:44:53,152 --> 00:44:54,952
But there is such a thing
as common courtesy.

695
00:44:55,072 --> 00:44:57,713
Charles, there's a kid in post-op
with a perforated descending colon.

696
00:44:57,793 --> 00:45:00,433
- Check him for fever, okay?
- Certainly. Anything else?

697
00:45:00,513 --> 00:45:04,954
Oh, yeah. Yeah, there is.
But I better handle it myself.

698
00:45:07,714 --> 00:45:11,954
- Father! Father! I'm leaving now.
- What? You're leaving?

699
00:45:12,034 --> 00:45:14,995
I've just got a minute.
I want to check your ears before I go.

700
00:45:15,115 --> 00:45:17,755
- What do you hear?
- I hear your watch ticking.

701
00:45:17,835 --> 00:45:19,915
- What do you hear in that ear?
- Same thing, your watch.

702
00:45:20,035 --> 00:45:22,076
Really? I just put it
in my pocket.

703
00:45:22,156 --> 00:45:24,636
Well, in that case, I couldn't hear it
in the other ear, either.

704
00:45:24,756 --> 00:45:27,076
Your hearing is not improving.
I think it's getting worse.

705
00:45:27,196 --> 00:45:30,477
In a few weeks, you may not be able to hear
at all. You gotta go home.

You're going home to your child.

[Pierpoint On P.A.]
It is now 2:00 p.m.

<i>The war also killed
400,000 Korean civilians.</i>

Can I ask you something
of a personal nature?

1197

Well, in another minute,

Oh, what I understand about women
will take a lot less than a minute.

1200
01:21:20,611 --> 01:21:24,252
I thought when the war was over,
it'd be the happiest day of my life.

But everything's

Listen, when you're in love,
you're always in trouble.

1204

There's only two things
you can do about it.

1205

Either stop lovin' 'em
or love 'em a whole lot more.

1206

But if you love 'em
a whole lot more...

1207
01:21:39,774 --> 01:21:41,854
won't that just get you
a lot more trouble?

1208
01:21:41,974 --> 01:21:44,614
Yup. Then you
love 'em even more.

Boy, that sounds tough.

It's murder.

[All]

For me, a banana.
And, of course...

1214
01:21:59,696 --> 01:22:01,896

when you get home?
- Well, I like fresh corn.

1219
01:22:12,738 --> 01:22:14,658
I mean, real fresh corn.

1220
01:22:14,778 --> 01:22:19,458
So I think maybe I'll just take a hot plate out
to the garden, make a pot of boiling water.

1221
01:22:19,578 --> 01:22:21,539
Then I won't even
pick that corn.

1222
01:22:21,659 --> 01:22:24,739
I'll bend that stalk,
till the ear dips into the water...

1223
01:22:24,859 --> 01:22:26,939
and I'll eat it
right there standin' up.

How about you, Charles?
What are you looking forward to?

1226
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:33,700
I am looking forward
to a hemostat.

1227

try to help them.

1231

- I think a person is lucky if
somebody cares enough to help.

1232
01:22:50,502 --> 01:22:53,062
Where would I be without
my father's help?

[Chuckles] Where indeed? He's pulling you
in three different directions.

a piece of you in every corner of the world.

1235
01:23:00,623 --> 01:23:04,424
Maybe some people
just can't feel gratitude.

1236
01:23:04,504 --> 01:23:07,624
Maybe some people like having
other people run their lives.

1237
01:23:07,704 --> 01:23:09,664
But some people don't.

pretty much as I expected.

1446
01:35:38,153 --> 01:35:41,113
With one exception.

1447
01:35:41,233 --> 01:35:45,674
For me, music was
always a refuge...

1448
01:35:45,794 --> 01:35:49,114
from this
miserable experience.

1449
01:35:49,234 --> 01:35:52,995
And now it will
always be a reminder.

1450
01:35:55,795 --> 01:35:57,635
So I'm going to
stay in nursing...

1451
01:35:57,715 --> 01:36:00,316
but I wanna be in maternity
or pediatrics.

1452
01:36:00,396 --> 01:36:05,116
After all this, I think it would be nice to help
bring people into the world.

1453
01:36:05,196 --> 01:36:08,157
I wanna be an officer,
so I'm gonna try and get into O.C.S.

1454
01:36:08,277 --> 01:36:11,077
Then I'm gonna be the best darn
nurse Oklahoma's ever seen.

1455
01:36:11,197 --> 01:36:13,277
Well,
for the next few days...

1456
01:36:13,357 --> 01:36:17,318
I'll be helping with the consolidation
of the 8063rd.

1457
01:36:17,438 --> 01:36:19,598
And then after
a little furlough...

1458
01:36:19,718 --> 01:36:21,598
I'll be going on
to my next assignment.

You're both wrong.

1461
01:36:26,399 --> 01:36:28,879
I've always looked
to my father for guidance.

1462
01:36:28,999 --> 01:36:30,999
When he makes up his mind
about something...

1463
01:36:31,079 --> 01:36:33,520
he does it no matter
what anybody says.

1464
01:36:33,640 --> 01:36:35,440
And that's
what I'm gonna do.

01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:37,360

to do all along...

There's a lot of
my father in me.

1469
01:36:45,161 --> 01:36:50,842
It's never been his way to tell
people how he feels about them.

1470
01:36:50,922 --> 01:36:53,602
So I guess that's why...

1471
01:36:53,682 --> 01:36:57,202
I never told
my nursing staff...

1472
01:36:57,322 --> 01:36:59,563
what I told other people
about you.

1594
01:44:45,738 --> 01:44:48,378
I've done mine."

1596
01:44:51,659 --> 01:44:54,019
Father, I may never see you
again, and before you go...

1597
01:44:54,139 --> 01:44:56,939
there's something I've been
meaning to tell you for a long time.

1598
01:44:57,059 --> 01:44:59,620
- Your shirt's on backwards.
- Uh.

1599
01:44:59,740 --> 01:45:03,020

[Engine Starts]

1601
01:45:09,141 --> 01:45:12,421
Good-bye, everybody.
I'll pray for you.

1602
01:45:22,902 --> 01:45:26,503
- Okay, Major, pile on.
- As what? A hood ornament?

1603
01:45:27,583 --> 01:45:29,423
I'm sorry, Major.

1604
01:45:29,543 --> 01:45:32,864
The rest of this stuff can go on the truck.
I'll catch up with it.

1605
01:45:32,944 --> 01:45:35,744
No, Margaret. Margaret,
you stay with your belongings.

1606
01:45:35,824 --> 01:45:38,624
If you leave them with the army,
you'll never see them again.

1607
01:45:38,704 --> 01:45:40,584
You go ahead.
Go in the jeep.

1608
01:45:40,704 --> 01:45:44,225
I'm sure Sergeant Rizzo
will find me another mode.

1609
01:45:44,305 --> 01:45:49,065
<i>Well, I'll go take a look, but we ain't got
too many modes left, Major.</i>

1610
01:45:49,185 --> 01:45:53,426
Hmm. Actually, uh, Margaret,
I'm taking too many things myself.

1611
01:45:53,546 --> 01:45:57,306
I wonder if you would tuck
one more item in with you.

1612
01:46:07,948 --> 01:46:09,748
Thank you, Charles.

1613
01:46:09,868 --> 01:46:11,748
Thank you, Margaret.

1614
01:46:13,708 --> 01:46:17,669
<i>Hold on to that arm, Charles.
We want to kiss it too.</i>

1615
01:46:17,789 --> 01:46:20,269
You take the arm.
I got dibs on what's left.

1616
01:46:23,790 --> 01:46:27,630
- So long, Margaret.
- I hope someday I find someone like you.

1617
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:30,630
I hope so too.
You deserve the best.

1618
01:46:30,710 --> 01:46:32,591
[Laughing]

1619
01:46:37,671 --> 01:46:39,471
Good-bye, Margaret.

1620
01:46:39,591 --> 01:46:41,912
I know you've got
your career in order...

1621
01:46:42,032 --> 01:46:44,112
but don't forget to have
a happy life too.

1622
01:46:45,712 --> 01:46:47,952
You're a dear, sweet man.

1623
01:46:48,032 --> 01:46:49,993
I'll never forget you.

1624
01:47:06,435 --> 01:47:08,315
So, uh, listen...

1625
01:47:09,395 --> 01:47:11,275
Yeah.

1626
01:47:52,000 --> 01:47:54,520
- Well, so long.
- See you.

<i>[Man]
Timber!</i>

1629
01:48:14,203 --> 01:48:16,923
How I wish I could
have swung the ax.

1630
01:48:17,043 --> 01:48:19,443
Just think of all the rats
who are homeless now.

1631
01:48:19,563 --> 01:48:21,724
Oh, don't worry. You'll find somewhere to go.
[Chuckles]

1632
01:48:21,844 --> 01:48:24,084
Excuse me, Major.
I got some transportation for you...

1633
01:48:24,164 --> 01:48:26,004
but it ain't
exactly a sedan.

1634
01:48:26,084 --> 01:48:29,764
- As long as it's got wheels.
- Oh, what a sport.

1635
01:48:31,005 --> 01:48:32,965
So long, Major.

1636
01:48:33,085 --> 01:48:36,605
You can be proud of the work you've done here.
You're a fine surgeon.

1637
01:48:36,725 --> 01:48:39,126
Well, thank you, sir.
As are you.

1638
01:48:39,246 --> 01:48:42,766
Shortly, I will be in a position of authority
over other surgeons...

1639
01:48:42,846 --> 01:48:46,206
and I hope I will be guided
by the memory of your wisdom...

1640
01:48:46,326 --> 01:48:48,127
and your gentle good humor.

1641
01:48:48,247 --> 01:48:51,207
Well, that's very
kind of you, Charles.

1642
01:48:53,287 --> 01:48:55,808
I'm sure you've got an even
bigger compliment for me, Charles...

1643
01:48:55,928 --> 01:48:59,048
- but let's not get gooey.
- I want to thank you both.

1644
01:48:59,168 --> 01:49:03,008
You have made me realize what
going home is all about.

1645
01:49:03,128 --> 01:49:06,969
<i>Major, I hope you don't mind
ridin'in a garbage truck...</i>

1646
01:49:07,049 --> 01:49:09,209
but it's the last
vehicle I got.

1647
01:49:09,289 --> 01:49:13,570
Not at all. What better way to
leave a garbage dump?

1648
01:49:13,690 --> 01:49:16,530
Don't slip. There's gunk on
these runnin' boards.

1649
01:49:20,290 --> 01:49:22,211
Gentlemen.

1650
01:49:32,572 --> 01:49:34,652
So, how are you gettin'
out of here, Colonel?

1651
01:49:34,772 --> 01:49:38,333
Oh, I've got my transportation
over yonder.

1652
01:49:38,453 --> 01:49:41,413
There's a jeep meeting me
at the orphanage.

1653
01:49:41,533 --> 01:49:44,093
I'll take one last
ride on Sophie.

1654
01:49:44,173 --> 01:49:48,454
Then, at the padre's request,
I'm givin' her to the orphans.

1655
01:49:48,534 --> 01:49:52,334
They can use her for farming
and maybe take her for a ride now and then.

1656
01:49:52,454 --> 01:49:54,415
She's real good with kids.

1657
01:49:59,815 --> 01:50:04,456
<i>Well, boys, it would be hard to call
what we've been through fun...</i>

1658
01:50:04,576 --> 01:50:07,896
but I'm sure glad we went
through it together.

1659
01:50:07,976 --> 01:50:12,817
You boys always managed to give me a good
laugh right when I needed it most.

1660
01:50:12,937 --> 01:50:17,017
Never forget the time you dropped
Winchester's drawers in the O.R.

1661
01:50:17,097 --> 01:50:20,418
Of course I had to pretend
I was mad at you, but...

1662
01:50:20,538 --> 01:50:24,938
inside I was laughin'
to beat all hell.

1663
01:50:26,098 --> 01:50:27,978
Yeah, I'm laughing
just thinking about it.

1664
01:50:28,099 --> 01:50:30,179
I love a good laugh
like this.

1665
01:50:30,259 --> 01:50:32,339
I better get out of here.

1666
01:50:35,299 --> 01:50:37,100
Colonel, before you go...

1667
01:50:37,220 --> 01:50:40,380
We've been thinking about it, and there's
a little something we'd like to give you.

1668
01:50:40,460 --> 01:50:42,700
It's not much,
but it comes from the heart.

for you to say good-bye, so I'll say it.

Maybe you're right.
Maybe we will see each other again.

1675

But just in case we don't...

1676
01:52:17,792 --> 01:52:20,312
I want you to know how much
you've meant to me.

I'll never be able
to shake you.

1678
01:52:27,393 --> 01:52:31,593
Whenever I see a big pair of feet
or a cheesy mustache, I'll think of you.

1679
01:52:31,673 --> 01:52:34,834
Whenever I smell month-old socks,
I'll think of you.

nails my shoe to the floor.

a martini that tastes like lighter fluid.

1682
01:52:45,595 --> 01:52:47,635
I'll miss you.

1683
01:52:47,715 --> 01:52:49,795
I'll miss you... a lot.

1684
01:52:51,716 --> 01:52:55,316
I can't imagine what this place would have
been like if I hadn't found you here.

1685
01:53:23,599 --> 01:53:26,880
I'll see you back in the states.
I promise.

1686
01:53:27,000 --> 01:53:29,400
But, just in case,
I left you a note.

1687
01:53:29,480 --> 01:53:31,040
What?
