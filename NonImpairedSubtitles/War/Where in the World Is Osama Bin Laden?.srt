Maybe he's on dialysis.

X-ray vision and the power of flight.

All I know is that
in the last six years,

00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:41,620
there've been more acts
of terrorism, worldwide,

37
00:02:41,694 --> 00:02:45,425
than in 20 years leading up to it.
Today, there are known terrorist cells

in more than 100 countries
around the world.

OK. [laughs]
You'll probably find him.

Um, you're going to need a whole

- Diphtheria, tetanus, polio.

Typhoid, meningitis, hepatitis A and B.

This one I must tell you about.
This is your yellow fever.

About one in one million people

The first thing you want to do

78

is turn away from the grenade and dive.

If a gunman came, where is he
most likely to hit? You're dead here.

89
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:46,530
This is what we call the "fatal funnel."

You want to stay behind that line,
you want to stay off the wall.

You're dead here.
You're dead here.

92

Any time you leave your vehicle,
you gotta assume, in dangerous places,

93
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:02,010
someone could plant a bomb
on your vehicle. You're dead here.

Here's what I recommend,
you go around the corner,

96
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,925
and then you can pull it open,

97
00:07:10,997 --> 00:07:14,057

you can go check it out.

Because if I'm going to find Osama,

100
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:24,132
I'm traveling to scary places. In the
last year, the State Department issued

over 100 warnings about
traveling to the Middle East.

102
00:07:27,046 --> 00:07:31,278
Mainly because Americans are now bigger

Don't have a harsh tone of voice.
Don't be argumentative.

Don't have an attitude.

113

00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:25,586
what drives an Osama bin Laden to begin
with. I know just the place to start.

152
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:29,094

[ Malik Audouane: Theme from Shaft]

154
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,748
Egypt is the birthplace
of one of the heaviest hitters

155
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,053
in the world of terrorism.
Ayman Al-Zawahiri.

156
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:04,688
He's Al-Qaeda's Team Manager
and Osama's personal mentor.

157
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:06,629
His stats are pretty impressive.

158
00:11:06,699 --> 00:11:09,600
He was a member of the
Muslim Brotherhood at the age of 14.

159
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,830
He's a life-long follower
of Sayyid Qutb,

160
00:11:11,904 --> 00:11:15,533
the man credited with creating
modern day Islamic fundamentalism,

161
00:11:15,608 --> 00:11:18,133
is currently the number two
of Al-Qaeda, and...

162
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:19,871
...he's a Gemini.

163
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,937
And I got a tip where
to find his uncle, Mahfouz Azzam.

164
00:11:23,015 --> 00:11:27,679
If he can tell me where the A-man is,
odds are Osama won't be too far away.

165
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,520
- Hello.
- Hello. Mahfouz? [speaks Arabic]

166
00:11:30,589 --> 00:11:33,490
- It's nice to see you. Welcome.
- Nice to see you.

167
00:11:33,559 --> 00:11:34,992
- Thank you.
- Please.

168
00:11:35,061 --> 00:11:38,053
- It's a beautiful day today. Very nice.
- Yeah.

169
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,626
- [Morgan] So do you know where he is?
- [man in Arabic] No.

170
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:43,066
Where do you think he is?

171
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:48,198
[in Arabic] If you learn where
he is, I beg you, let me know.

172
00:11:49,575 --> 00:11:53,341
I just want to make sure he is OK.

173
00:11:53,412 --> 00:11:59,146
He won't let me know by phone
because you kill people with the phone.

174
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:03,917
The Russians killed the president
of Chechnya with the phone,

175
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:10,421
and you Americans have killed
people with the phone.

176
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:15,661
This, a telephone,
has become a lethal weapon!

177
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:18,670
And every month my bank account
gets killed by my phone.

178
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,901
- [laughing]
- Which makes it even worse.

179
00:12:23,008 --> 00:12:25,238
So, if you knew where he was,

180
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:27,836
you wouldn't turn him in
for the $25,000,000?

181
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,041
[laughs]

182
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:34,450
I would like to tell you something,

183
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,954
the hungry

184
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:41,015
who cannot find bread to eat

185
00:12:41,093 --> 00:12:43,960
in Afghanistan

186
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,055
they wouldn't accept
these $25 million of yours

187
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:51,467
to turn in a Muslim they know
is waging jihad for them.

188
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:53,562
So he's in Afghanistan?

189
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,404
- You say so.
- You said so. You just told me.

190
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:00,104
America says so. America says so.

191
00:13:00,179 --> 00:13:02,875
- Do you think he's in Afghanistan?
- America says.

192
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:08,511
So if Al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden
just disappeared tomorrow,

193
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,054
would things change?

194
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:15,115
The seed that was sown by America,

195
00:13:15,194 --> 00:13:18,493
a seed of spitefulness, hate,

196
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:21,328
aggression and killing,

197
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:26,337
cannot disappear in the short term.

198
00:13:28,407 --> 00:13:32,969
There has to be another foreign
policy to uproot this seed.

199
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:36,446
[Morgan] It's easy to criticize
American foreign policy,

200
00:13:36,515 --> 00:13:39,177
with the second most wanted
terrorist in the family.

201
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,277
I should find regular folks
who might be more objective.

202
00:13:42,354 --> 00:13:44,845
What do you guys hear about Americans?

203
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:48,883
[in Arabic] The Americans
are known to be fighting

204
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:52,021
the Egyptians, Palestinians and lraqis.

205
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,657
- We're fighting you?
- [laughing]

206
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,293
- Yes.
- Really? I didn't even know that.

207
00:13:57,369 --> 00:13:59,462
What are we fighting the Egyptians for?

208
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,802
[speaking Arabic]

209
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:04,633
You want to occupy Egypt.

210
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:05,972
[Morgan] Do we? Why?

211
00:14:06,045 --> 00:14:08,878
We're not that well versed in politics

212
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,815
but that's what we hear on TV and stuff.

213
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:13,215
What do you think about America?

214
00:14:13,285 --> 00:14:16,982
[in Arabic] They are good people, but
we reject the American foreign policy.

215
00:14:17,056 --> 00:14:19,854
[Morgan] How can he be against
American foreign policy?

216
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:24,225
Egypt is one of our best friends in the
region and in the global war on terror.

217
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:28,528
At the same time, it was home to five
of the founding fathers of Al-Qaeda.

218
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:31,764
The guy who tried to blow up
the World Trade Center in '93,

219
00:14:31,837 --> 00:14:34,704
and the ringleader
of the 9/1 1 hijackings.

220
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:39,210
Maybe university students could tell me
why Osama's making so many friends here.

221
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,543
It's about oppression, because
Egypt is a developing country,

222
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:45,550
so, like, the people who are
oppressed are kind of more...

223
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:48,678
So it develops more terrorists,
and that's it.

224
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:54,090
[in Arabic] These would be
the minority, the rotten type.

225
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,990
Every society has the same.

226
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,256
Every society has good and bad.

227
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,561
In Egypt, people have no freedom.

228
00:15:01,634 --> 00:15:06,264
And they try and prove to the government
that they have freedom, deserve freedom,

229
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:08,238
by committing terrorist attacks.

230
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,775
Did you vote in the last
presidential election?

231
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,743
- No.
- No.

232
00:15:12,811 --> 00:15:15,371
- You weren't old enough yet?
- It's not that.

233
00:15:15,447 --> 00:15:18,416
I don't believe in it.
I know it's rigged.

234
00:15:18,484 --> 00:15:22,580
I know that Hosni Mubarak
would have won anyway.

235
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:26,421
They call this a democratic country,
but it's not.

236
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:30,019
In Egypt, if a president wants
to stay in power, he'll stay in power.

237
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:31,096
[applause]

238
00:15:31,163 --> 00:15:34,860
[Morgan] And Hosni Mubarak has
been in power for more than 26 years.

239
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:40,934
The United States has got a close
and meaningful relationship with Egypt.

240
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:42,439
[cheering]

241
00:15:42,508 --> 00:15:46,376
This relationship is a cornerstone
for our policy in the Middle East.

242
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,539
[Morgan] Policy that includes
giving Mubarak an aid package,

243
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:52,948
while looking the other way
as he uses riot police and hired thugs

244
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:56,351
armed with sticks, knives,
swords and Molotov cocktails

245
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:59,152
to keep the opposition
from voting on election day.

246
00:15:59,224 --> 00:16:03,888
You might say about Mubarak the same
thing FDR said about another dictator.

247
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:08,229
He may be a son of a bitch,
but he's our son of a bitch.

248
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:11,064
[Morgan] See, we've had a policy
of propping up dictators

249
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:14,401
for more than 50 years now.
When the Cold War started heating up,

250
00:16:14,473 --> 00:16:18,000
we decided to do what it took
to stop communism from taking over.

251
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,569
And the United States started mixing
with a rougher crowd.

252
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:23,239
Hmm!

253
00:16:23,315 --> 00:16:27,308
In 1 953, the CIA helped the Shah of
Iran overthrow the Iranian government,

254
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:29,286
to become their supreme ruler.

255
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:33,348
Sure, the Shah tortured or killed
anyone who publicly disagreed with him.

256
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:37,225
Even went as far as shoving broken glass
up the nether regions of critics.

257
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,696
But he totally hated Communism.

258
00:16:39,765 --> 00:16:43,428
Now, he was a son of a bitch,
but he was our son of a bitch.

259
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,528
The Shah kept Iran
in our corner until 1 979,

260
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:49,972
when Ayatollah Khomeini's
Islamic revolution swept to power,

261
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:52,374
and held 52 Americans hostage
for 15 months.

262
00:16:52,444 --> 00:16:55,743
That's when we made friends
with Saddam Hussein over in Iraq.

263
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:58,180
Now, he was an SOB too,
but for ten years,

264
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,777
while he was fighting the Iranians,
he was our SOB.

265
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:06,450
In fact, by the mid-'80s, we had sons of
bitches all the way from Latin America

266
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:10,427
to the Middle East, but, hey,
pimping freedom ain't easy.

267
00:17:10,496 --> 00:17:13,488
[hip-hop music plays]

268
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:16,867
[Morgan] We needed to keep
our SOBs happy and on our side.

269
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:20,871
So we provided them with tanks,
guns, planes and more money.

270
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,670
Today we give Egypt more than 2 billion
dollars a year in weapons and aid.

271
00:17:24,743 --> 00:17:28,270
Sure, there's torture, murder
and rampant political corruption,

272
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,747
but somewhere along the way
we decided that,

273
00:17:30,816 --> 00:17:32,784
in order to protect our own freedom,

274
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,649
it was all right to sacrifice
the freedom of others.

275
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:40,723
Does lack of democracy, human rights,
in countries like Egypt

276
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:44,729
encourage people to get involved
in extremist radical groups?

277
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,561
Of course. There's no doubt about this.

278
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:51,899
It's the one thing that
I agree with George W. Bush about.

279
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:54,268
That people join terrorist organizations

280
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:56,705
because there is
no other way to be active.

281
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:01,474
The threat of terrorism created the
climate of fear that is being exploited

282
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:05,176
by the Mubarak regime
and by George Bush.

283
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,151
We're going through
a very difficult time now.

284
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,552
I mean, we have terrorists on one side,

285
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:15,389
and opportunist, exploitative regimes
on the other side.

286
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,895
The U.S. can no longer
claim the moral ground.

287
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:23,196
People have learned to expect a lot
less from the U.S. than they used to.

288
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,726
[Arabic music plays]

289
00:18:37,483 --> 00:18:39,815
[man in Arabic] The United States is
the main problem in the region, frankly.

290
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:44,584
We love the American people, but
we hate the American government.

291
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:47,489
[in Arabic] We pray to God
to destroy you

292
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:50,722
because of what's happening.

293
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:54,459
[Morgan] America's filled with people
who want people to live peacefully,

294
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:56,296
to co-exist together, just like me.

295
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:59,633
OK, I don't want you to be there
when it happens.

296
00:18:59,705 --> 00:19:01,138
Have a smell.

297
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:04,107
[Morgan] You know, being in the States,
all we get on the news

298
00:19:04,176 --> 00:19:07,145
are the crazy nuts
that like to scream, "Death to you!"

299
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:09,373
And so you're like,
"Oh, man. Go get them."

300
00:19:10,282 --> 00:19:12,682
But we've been in Egypt for a week now,

301
00:19:12,751 --> 00:19:16,016
talking to people, who are real people,
just like you and me.

302
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,983
One after another after another
everybody said,

303
00:19:20,058 --> 00:19:23,755
"This government's corrupt
and it's backed by the U. S. "

304
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:28,528
- [chanting]
- It's hard for me to see how damaged

305
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:33,162
the image of the country that
I love and care about has become.

306
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:40,069
[phone rings]

307
00:19:40,145 --> 00:19:43,842
- [Morgan] Hello?
- I got your postcard from Egypt today.

308
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:46,646
Oh, nice. You sound good.

309
00:19:46,718 --> 00:19:51,178
I am good. Just promise you'll be here
when it's really important. OK?

310
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:52,985
I promise.

311
00:19:53,058 --> 00:19:57,620
[woman] He has to be back by the
first week of November, because I'm due

312
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,426
the end of November, early December.

313
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,832
And, if he misses that,
I'm going to be so upset.

314
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:05,597
And he's going to be upset.

315
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:10,131
But, also, he's going to these places
that are so dangerous.

316
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:14,709
And I don't want him to miss anything.
And I don't want him to get hurt.

317
00:20:15,247 --> 00:20:16,874
[man singing in Arabic]

318
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:20,350
[man in Arabic] While we are
living in these troubled times,

319
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:24,919
we need to be merciful.

320
00:20:24,990 --> 00:20:28,926
So get mercy through praises
and prayers upon Him...

321
00:20:30,495 --> 00:20:33,658
...because He is mercy.

322
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,691
And He puts compassion in your heart.

323
00:20:41,773 --> 00:20:45,573
As a Muslim I am taught
that God has honored humankind.

324
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:49,671
He did not say he honored Muslims and
everyone else is a second class citizen.

325
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,683
[speaking Arabic]
We have honored the children of heaven.

326
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,744
[singing in Arabic]

327
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:05,763
[man] Your average Egyptian's struggling
like your average American

328
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:06,923
to make ends meet,

329
00:21:06,999 --> 00:21:10,196
to get a decent job, provide
for his family, educate his kids.

330
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:11,930
The same concerns all over.

331
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:17,232
[Morgan] Torek is an Egyptian-American
studying law at Al Azhar University.

332
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,005
He's a new dad and wants
the world's view of Islam

333
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,103
to change for the sake
of his young son.

334
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,807
[Torek] We need to rectify this,

335
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,783
Muslims are over one fifth
of the world population.

336
00:21:26,852 --> 00:21:31,050
That's a lot of people. It's not
some Polynesian island somewhere.

337
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:33,421
- [Morgan laughs]
- That's a lot of people!

338
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,290
If four-fifths of the world
are scared of one-fifth,

339
00:21:36,361 --> 00:21:39,330
what kind of civilization and humanity
are we gonna have?

340
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:42,799
- [laughing]
- [speaking Arabic]

341
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,464
Now they're going to think
all we do is pray.

342
00:21:52,878 --> 00:21:55,403
- Even the kids!
- I'm working on the voice-over.

343
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,109
From a very young age,
they start manipulating the children.

344
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:00,173
[laughing]

345
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:04,621
[Torek] We need to differentiate between
extreme factions in a population,

346
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:07,090
and the regular,
vast majority of people.

347
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,684
What do you think of the War on Terror?

348
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:12,389
It's a bogus term.
I don't think it means anything.

349
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:13,829
I think some guy

350
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:17,596
that had too much to drink in the
Pentagon, one night, came up with that.

351
00:22:17,669 --> 00:22:20,035
- Dude, I got a great idea.
- A war on terrorism.

352
00:22:20,105 --> 00:22:22,596
We had a war on drugs.
We didn't win that, either.

353
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,472
[Torek] But is it really
a war on terror?

354
00:22:25,544 --> 00:22:28,479
Have we eradicated terror?
Or are we exporting terror?

355
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:33,879
I think that... Unfortunately,
I think that we're exporting it.

356
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:38,719
I think that we lit the flame on a bomb.

357
00:22:40,258 --> 00:22:42,089
[Morgan] The bomb Torek is speaking of

358
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:44,253
is the explosive rise
in terrorist attacks

359
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,887
during the last seven years.

360
00:22:45,964 --> 00:22:48,398
Al-Qaeda has now become
a global franchise,

361
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:52,164
serving up an unhealthy dose of j ihad
to more and more people each year.

362
00:22:52,237 --> 00:22:55,104
Ooh! Can I help you?

363
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:59,576
[Morgan] Despite the U. S. spending over
$500 billion fighting the war on terror,

364
00:22:59,644 --> 00:23:02,909
Al-Qaeda continues to find
new markets to expand into.

365
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:07,475
Thanks to heavy worldwide recruitment,
which included having interested people

366
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:12,251
filling out job applications,
AQ is now back to its pre-9/1 1 strength.

367
00:23:12,724 --> 00:23:15,488
Two of the U. S. 's closest allies,
Spain and England,

368
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,120
were both attacked
by homegrown Al-Qaeda cells.

369
00:23:18,196 --> 00:23:21,893
Even Muslim countries are finding
they are in Al-Qaeda's crosshairs,

370
00:23:21,967 --> 00:23:24,128
often becoming the victims of terrorism

371
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:27,330
and feeling the influence
of Osama bin Laden firsthand.

372
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:29,397
[Arabic music plays]

373
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,521
[Morgan] Where is Osama bin Laden?

374
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,962
[in Arabic] He might be
somewhere here in Morocco.

375
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,601
[in Arabic] How should I know?

376
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,807
- Bin Laden? I am not a politic man.
- Yeah.

377
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:08,243
I don't know nothing about...
I'm a carpet dealer. I sell carpet.

378
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,474
[Morgan] How many years
has this tannery been here?

379
00:24:10,549 --> 00:24:12,176
[in Arabic] Centuries.

380
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:15,583
What do you think about people
who cause violence in the name of lslam?

381
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:20,648
[in Arabic] It is not from lslam
to kill innocent people

382
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:25,355
or to blow yourself up.

383
00:24:26,731 --> 00:24:28,699
I'm disgusted by that.

384
00:24:28,767 --> 00:24:32,100
[Morgan] Do you ever worry that your
sons may get involved with terrorists?

385
00:24:32,170 --> 00:24:33,535
We worry about that.

386
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:37,939
We don't want them to get involved
with that kind of crowd.

387
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:42,105
That's why we have to take care
of them financially.

388
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,413
[man in Arabic] Americans are
causing all the trouble in the world.

389
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,581
But... Were the...

390
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,352
But this is my opinion
of the American government,

391
00:24:54,426 --> 00:24:55,757
not the American people.

392
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:58,455
[in Arabic] These are all
the problems that Bush created.

393
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,395
I heard that they want
to eradicate lslam.

394
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,636
[Morgan] What do you think
about Osama bin Laden?

395
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,697
[speaking Arabic]

396
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:13,835
[Morgan laughs] He's crazy?

397
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,103
[in Arabic] Osama bin Laden,
look how many people he's killed,

398
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,513
how many have died.
And what has he accomplished?

399
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:22,246
He's accomplished a wave
of suicide bombings in Morocco

400
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,585
killing more than 50 people
over the last four years.

401
00:25:25,657 --> 00:25:27,818
The first attack was in May of 2003,

402
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:31,989
when recruiters outside the country came
to town and convinced 14 young men

403
00:25:32,063 --> 00:25:36,090
to blow themselves up in exchange
for money and the rewards of paradise.

404
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:39,864
They all grew up on the exact same
street in the desperately poor ghetto

405
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:42,133
of Sidi Moumen.

406
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,470
I met journalist Aboubakr Jamai,

407
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,774
to find out what'd drive young men
to cause such destruction.

408
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,045
[Jamai] I think it's
a mix of ingredients.

409
00:25:51,116 --> 00:25:53,414
And, depending on the situation,

410
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,750
one of the ingredients
is more important than the others.

411
00:25:56,821 --> 00:25:59,654
And, these ingredients,
I think in the case of Morocco,

412
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,784
the socio-economic ingredient
is the most important one.

413
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:08,299
It's not a coincidence that all
of the guys who blew themselves up

414
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:13,497
in the 1 6th of May, uh, 2003,
came from this shantytown.

415
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:17,133
They were either unemployed
or had menial jobs.

416
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:20,769
And they were completely outcast
in their own society.

417
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,904
[Morgan] What do you think
is the solution?

418
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:25,575
[Jamai] The problem in Morocco,
with the people here,

419
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,915
is that we fail to give them
an economic voice and a political voice.

420
00:26:28,987 --> 00:26:33,083
To me, that's the solution. Need to
give opportunity, economically speaking,

421
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,922
because extremism
nourishes itself from darkness.

422

[ Ernest Ranglin
and Baaba Maal: Haayo]

423
00:26:48,673 --> 00:26:51,904
[Morgan] That evening I was invited
to dinner with Ahmed and his family,

424
00:26:51,977 --> 00:26:54,411
in the same 200 square-foot house
he grew up in.

425
00:26:54,479 --> 00:26:58,973
Ahmed doesn't want his children to fall
prey to the same people the bombers did.

426
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,678
But with a poor education system
and little money,

427
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,653
he fears they could be exploited.

428
00:27:03,722 --> 00:27:06,782
Thank you for letting us come here.
This is a great thing.

429
00:27:06,858 --> 00:27:10,350
[in Arabic] lslam obligates us to be
this way, to be brothers with everyone.

430
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:14,626
[Morgan] I'm about to have a baby in
December. Give me some fatherly advice.

431
00:27:14,699 --> 00:27:18,931
You should take care of your wife.

432
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,869
I've got a good wife, so that's good.

433
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:24,133
If your relationship is based
on love and good values,

434
00:27:24,209 --> 00:27:26,939
you will have good children.

435
00:27:27,012 --> 00:27:28,274
[Morgan] Wow.

436
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,206
What kind of fish is that?

437
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:32,472
It's like a sardine.

438
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,574
It's delicious.

439
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,517
I'm glad. Eat with good health.

440
00:27:36,755 --> 00:27:40,191
So, I want you to tell me,
what do you hope for your kids?

441
00:27:40,258 --> 00:27:43,284
I want my kids to get an education.

442
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:47,127
The people who aren't educated won't
accomplish anything in their life.

443
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:48,460
How did you do in school?

444
00:27:48,533 --> 00:27:51,331
- [laughter]
- She's laughing!

445
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,671
She teases me. Sometimes
she and the kids gang up on me.

446
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:01,871
So do I have that to look forward to?

447
00:28:01,946 --> 00:28:04,244
When you have your child
they will do the same to you.

448
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:09,487
How hard is it to get
a good education living in this area?

449
00:28:09,554 --> 00:28:12,523
You can't get well educated living here,

450
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:14,080
because of the poverty.

451
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,925
I'd like to hear your opinion. When we
hear about all these people who...

452
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:21,261
...commit acts of violence
in the name of lslam,

453
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:24,233
what are your thoughts on those people?

454
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:27,827
Those people do not belong to lslam.

455
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:32,138
Even the terrorism that happened
here was masterminded abroad.

456
00:28:32,210 --> 00:28:35,805
The people who blew themselves
up were tempted,

457
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:38,974
some tempted by money
and some by Paradise.

458
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:43,783
It is much harder for this generation
than it was for my generation.

459
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,869
[woman in French] Violence is birthed
by the economic dead ends

460
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:01,530
that confront our youth

461
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:05,599
who happen to be Muslim
with an lslamic outlook.

462
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:10,512
How do you feel that we, as Americans,
or how do we as a world culture...

463
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:12,607
...start to end the fighting?

464
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:17,018
I believe that there is an enormous
anger with American policy.

465
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:20,785
It's too bad it's the American people
who have to pay for that anger.

466
00:29:20,859 --> 00:29:25,626
And so we have the obligation
not to fail our future,

467
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:28,996
we have to reach out
to each other,

468
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,366
ignore official political lines

469
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:37,204
and create unofficial bridges
between civilian societies

470
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:38,572
in order to bring about change.

471
00:29:38,643 --> 00:29:42,670
What were your thoughts
after 9/1 1 happened?

472
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:45,816
If it were truly
Osama bin Laden, who did that,

473
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,715
then he dealt us a bad hand.

474
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,916
He legitimized the American
presence in the Middle East.

475
00:29:51,990 --> 00:29:55,653
He was the reason for the adoption
of all the anti-terrorist laws

476
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:59,128
that have pushed us further
under the yoke

477
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:02,166
of our own local political leaders.

478
00:30:02,233 --> 00:30:07,364
I was astonished on many levels.
It's horrible.

479
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:20,185
[beeping]

480
00:30:20,185 --> 00:30:22,847
[beeping]

481
00:30:28,593 --> 00:30:31,960
[Morgan] Osama bin Laden says one
reason for the creation of Al-Qaeda

482
00:30:32,030 --> 00:30:35,022
and attacks against the West,
is the existence of Israel,

483
00:30:35,099 --> 00:30:38,933
America's support of her and the
treatment of the Palestinian people.

484
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,471
If Osama cares
about the Palestinians so much,

485
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,167
I wanted to see if the feeling
was mutual. If it is,

486
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:47,541
I'm sure someone
can help me narrow in on it.

487
00:30:47,612 --> 00:30:50,775
[Morgan] How do you feel about
Al-Qaeda causing acts of terrorism

488
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:54,182
- in the name of the Palestinian people?
- I don't agree with Al-Qaeda.

489
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,310
Yeah.

490
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,911
I'll leave that alone.
I don't agree with them at all.

491
00:30:57,989 --> 00:31:01,186
It is none of their business
to do anything for us.

492
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:03,022
We can do for ourselves.

493
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:07,690
We are fighting to make our homeland
free. It's none of their business.

494
00:31:10,201 --> 00:31:13,728
[Morgan] I was wondering if you
could help? Looking for Osama bin Laden.

495
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:16,171
- [man] Go to Tora Bora. No.
- Not here in Ramallah?

496
00:31:16,241 --> 00:31:18,232
- No?
- They hate Osama bin Laden.

497
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:20,106
- Palestinians?
- Palestinians.

498
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,442
- And you know, if...
- Why do they hate him?

499
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:26,112
Because he likes blood. You know?

500
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:29,915
He is a ridiculous Muslim.
He gives a bad picture about lslam.

501
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,980
[Arabic hip-hop plays]

502
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:43,594
We've heard Hamas is on the
same level as Al-Qaeda. Is that true?

503
00:31:43,668 --> 00:31:47,502
[in Arabic] Ours is
not a religious conflict.

504
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,565
We don't fight the Jews
because they are Jews.

505
00:31:51,643 --> 00:31:54,703
No, we fight them
because they occupy our lands.

506
00:31:54,779 --> 00:31:58,875
And Al-Qaeda, it holds
all of the West as an enemy.

507
00:31:58,950 --> 00:32:01,145
But the number one reason
they say they do it

508
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:05,087
is because of the Palestinian conflict.
Because of what's happening here.

509
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:11,061
Any Arab leader, all Arab movements
have adopted the Palestinian issue

510
00:32:11,129 --> 00:32:16,431
because they know the Palestinian issue
is what triggers the emotions and

511
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:19,197
nationalistic feelings
in all Arab and Muslim people.

512
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:23,138
But, at the same point, they're using
you guys as, like, this battle cry,

513
00:32:23,207 --> 00:32:27,143
but they're doing nothing to help you.
That's the reality.

514
00:32:27,345 --> 00:32:28,972
Without the Palestinian issue,

515
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:33,711
they won't get any attention

516
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:37,118
on the global level.

517
00:32:37,188 --> 00:32:40,351
It is strategic on their part
to adopt the Palestinian issue.

518
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:57,804
[Morgan] Unbelievable how many
walls are here, the separation.

519
00:32:57,875 --> 00:33:00,901
Everywhere you go there's a wall,
a fence, barbed wire.

520
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,948
It's not for a human being.
It's good for a zoo.

521
00:33:04,182 --> 00:33:05,979
[in Arabic] If this
was happening in lsrael,

522
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,280
America and all the other
countries would protest it.

523
00:33:08,353 --> 00:33:10,878
- The peace of life, we don't have it.
- Yeah.

524
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:14,789
And we are living in very big prison.

525
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:19,262
[in Arabic] I wish we had somebody
like Osama bin Laden in Palestine.

526
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,857
Just to destroy the state of lsrael.

527
00:33:22,934 --> 00:33:27,769
It's a political struggle, a military
struggle. But the biggest thing is this.

528
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,466
All of this is about land.

529
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:33,202
Scattered through the hills
of the Palestinian West Bank,

530
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:37,304
are Israeli settlements, built to expand
the Jewish presence in the region.

531
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,515
How does it feel,
being overlooked by settlements?

532
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:44,544
It's not only overlooking us,
but we are always under their foot.

533
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,617
[in Arabic] They can come and take over
my home, where I live, by force.

534
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,184
What can I do? I can't do anything.

535
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:56,357
[man] Tears and blood were shed today
as Israel began the forced evacuation

536
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:58,698
of Jewish settlers from their homes.

537
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,269
[Morgan] The settlements
are a cause of violence

538
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:04,331
between settlers and Palestinians,

539
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,606
they are also a contentious issue
within Israeli politics.

540
00:34:07,678 --> 00:34:11,808
With one side seeing the settlements
as another obstacle in achieving peace,

541
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,477
while the other sees it
as a divine right.

542
00:34:14,552 --> 00:34:17,919
We Jews are the rightful owner
of this land.

543
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,957
- Mm-hmm.
- It was a land that was promised

544
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:24,324
to them by the Almighty, who kept
his promise and brought us back.

545
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:28,195
After we realized
there's going to be a struggle

546
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:31,565
about every centimeter of the land,

547
00:34:31,636 --> 00:34:35,003
we realized we have to
settle on the outposts

548
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:38,474
to enlarge the area.

549
00:34:38,543 --> 00:34:40,477
This outpost, for instance, it's...

550
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:43,673
- So is that legal to do that?
- It's illegal in the moment,

551
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:46,876
as it is in the process
of being legalized.

552
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,592
[Morgan] What is your thought
on the Palestinian conflict?

553
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:03,361
When we were kids, there was
this game where you play music

554
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,335
- and there's a circle of chairs.
- Yeah. Musical chairs.

555
00:35:06,404 --> 00:35:10,033
Musical chairs. This is a bit
like a musical chair tragedy.

556
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,440
Somebody is left without a chair.

557
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,104
But everybody needs to sit somewhere.

558
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:19,346
[Morgan] Should lsraelis
move out of the settlements?

559
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:22,875
IsraeI'll have to let go
of the territories.

560
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:26,515
We are not holding the territories,
the territories are holding us.

561
00:35:27,091 --> 00:35:29,286
The tragedy of this place

562
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:33,854
is that everybody knows exactly
what would be the solution in the end,

563
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:38,334
the end of the story. Two countries
that are connected, but separated.

564
00:35:38,402 --> 00:35:40,461
And this is the way it's going to end.

565
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:44,770
Every person in his right mind knows
this is the way it's going to end.

566
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:47,902
One thing we don't know is
how many people are going to die,

567
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:51,210
and how much time is going to pass.
But the end is very clear.

568
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:53,011
- Yeah.
- That's tragic.

569
00:35:53,084 --> 00:35:55,951
Are there politicians
working towards a solution?

570
00:35:56,020 --> 00:35:59,786
Yes, there are politicians
who are working for peace.

571
00:35:59,857 --> 00:36:04,521
The problem is, if you have
three buses exploding in Tel Aviv,

572
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:06,028
- it will stop.
- Yeah.

573
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,895
And we can progress
the peace process once again,

574
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:13,994
and then if a settler in the territories

575
00:36:14,071 --> 00:36:16,198
will kill somebody, it will stop again.

576
00:36:16,274 --> 00:36:20,608
And so, we're being held hostage
by the extremists from both sides.

577
00:36:32,056 --> 00:36:35,822
So this is basically lsrael,
and that's the Gaza Strip.

578
00:36:35,893 --> 00:36:37,724
And...

579
00:36:39,297 --> 00:36:42,198
It's pretty... It's pretty scary.

580
00:36:42,767 --> 00:36:47,898
It is really scary. Imagine that rolling
up over your hill, coming at your house.

581
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:53,842
Imagine living like this. Imagine
this is how you live every single day.

582
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:55,902
[explosion]

583
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,943
Oh, shit.

584
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:05,088
[woman] A Qassam touched down next to
a daycare center in Sderot this morning.

585
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:06,817
No one was wounded in the attack,

586
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:11,555
but the Hamas chief warned the
rocket attacks on Israel will continue.

587
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:27,842
[Morgan] So this classroom was blown up
about eight and a half hours ago.

588
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:32,042
Luckily, there were no kids in it.
Rocket came from the Gaza Strip.

589
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:35,947
If there had been kids in here,
half of them would be dead.

590
00:37:37,054 --> 00:37:39,784
You see this and get a sense
of how wrong things are.

591
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:42,690
I can't imagine raising my kid
up in a place like this.

592
00:37:42,760 --> 00:37:46,093
I couldn't imagine living in a place
where my kid went to school,

593
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:48,631
and this is something
that can happen every day.

594
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:58,105
[woman] I think everything's going
pretty good with the pregnancy.

595
00:37:58,175 --> 00:38:01,076
Thirty weeks, it's very active,

596
00:38:01,145 --> 00:38:06,276
and it's positioned the right way,
and everything's good.

597
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:08,875
Take deep, full breaths into the belly.

598
00:38:08,953 --> 00:38:11,854
I never imagined I would
spend my pregnancy like this,

599
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:14,948
separated from my partner,
but, then again,

600
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:19,690
before Morgan, I never thought
I would have kids, so... [laughs]

601
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:22,324
You just never can tell, can you?

602
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,369
[siren wails]

603
00:38:26,437 --> 00:38:29,429
Here with the lsraeli Police
Bomb Squad, they got a call.

604
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:31,998
Two calls, actually.
Going to check them out.

605
00:38:32,076 --> 00:38:34,044
[siren wails]

606
00:38:36,881 --> 00:38:40,248
- Is it right here?
- Yeah. Right, few feet of us.

607
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,785
Let's go!

608
00:38:41,852 --> 00:38:45,117
[in Hebrew] The suspicious object
is here, past the garbage can.

609
00:38:45,189 --> 00:38:47,248
[man in Hebrew] Listen up.
Good evening to everyone.

610
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,986
There is
a suspicious object there.

611
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,359
I am asking everyone
who is in this area of Allenby

612
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:55,092
and the area of the boardwalk
to move away from the area.

613
00:39:03,107 --> 00:39:06,634
The man on the hotel balcony,
get inside.

614
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:13,409
Everyone is requested to be
behind the police gates.

615
00:39:14,552 --> 00:39:17,453
Pay attention. This is the bomb squad.

616
00:39:17,521 --> 00:39:20,251
I am about to conduct a controlled
explosion on the suspicious object.

617
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:24,624
[Morgan] It's so scary.
And this happens every day.

618
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:27,425
Eight to ten times a day,
he said, sometimes up to 1 8.

619
00:39:27,498 --> 00:39:30,524
Don't stand near the windows.

620
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:51,217
[man] Three... two... one. Go.

621
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:59,028
There's a bikini inside.

622
00:39:59,096 --> 00:40:01,257
[laughs] Check it out.

623
00:40:04,702 --> 00:40:07,933
Well, my heart's pounding
and it's a bikini. [laughs]

624
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:14,904
Nice job, pal. You did good.

625
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,104
- [beeps]
- Good job, buddy.

626
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:20,975
No, come on.
Don't be so hard on yourself.

627
00:40:21,051 --> 00:40:24,509
- [beeping]
- There'll be plenty more chances.

628
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,628
- [Morgan] Can we ask you questions?
- [man] About what?

629
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:40,363
- About....
- Political?

630
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:42,269
- A little bit. [laughs]
- No, no.

631
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:47,767
I'd love to hear your thoughts on the
current conflict. It's all an illusion?

632
00:40:47,845 --> 00:40:49,005
Yes.

633
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:53,379
Wow. That guy is one of the
greatest optimists I've ever seen.

634
00:40:54,652 --> 00:40:57,212
How you doing?
Can I ask you a couple of questions?

635
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:59,119
[splashing]

636
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:01,158
So somebody just threw
a water balloon at us.

637
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,056
[man in Hebrew]
Get the hell out of here!

638
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:06,324
And now there's
a crowd gathering because

639
00:41:06,397 --> 00:41:09,833
they're going to chase us away.
They're gathering numbers now.

640
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,801
There's a big flock of people
that's going to chase us.

641
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:14,667
- Go off!
- [man in Hebrew] Get out of here!

642
00:41:14,738 --> 00:41:15,727
This is not your land.

643
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:18,070
I'm not allowed to talk
to anybody in the country?

644
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:20,633
[man in Hebrew]
Get the hell out of here!

645
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:23,612
- I'd say...
- Get out of here!

646
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:26,115
...we're not very wanted around here.

647
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,785
[in Hebrew] I'm going to break this.

648
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,953
This place is no joke. We were down
there just trying to talk to people.

649
00:41:40,030 --> 00:41:45,263
So what you see here, majority
of people here don't think like them.

650
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:49,329
Yeah, I think we've found
enough peace here today.

651
00:41:49,406 --> 00:41:52,933
Out of here, get out of here,
get out of here!

652
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,444
It is... It's no joke.

653
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,008
Go off! Go off!

654
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,414
- I'm going to my car.
- Go off!

655
00:42:02,486 --> 00:42:03,851
Dude.

656
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:05,980
- Yeah.
- Jewish?

657
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:08,251
I'm going to my car.

658
00:42:08,325 --> 00:42:11,692
- No Jewish.
- [shouting]

659
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:16,261
There's so many things
that are wrong on both sides.

660
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:20,869
If this was solved tomorrow,
if, suddenly, there were two states,

661
00:42:20,938 --> 00:42:24,374
and people were living in peace,
would bin Laden go away?

662
00:42:24,441 --> 00:42:26,033
I don't think it would happen.

663
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:29,011
What you're doing,
is you're taking an argument away.

664
00:42:29,413 --> 00:42:31,677
It isn't. It's messed up.

665
00:42:31,916 --> 00:42:33,213
[shouting]

666
00:42:33,284 --> 00:42:36,845
There goes my friend. See you.

667
00:42:55,205 --> 00:42:58,470
[Morgan] How hard is it for you
to be in the minority in this region,

668
00:42:58,542 --> 00:43:00,271
a Christian in a Muslim country?

669
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:05,247
I have no problem whatsoever,
living with the Muslims.

670
00:43:05,316 --> 00:43:06,806
We are worshipping Allah.

671
00:43:07,518 --> 00:43:12,080
And, uh, I am worshipping the same God,

672
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:16,991
that the Christians and the Muslims
and the Jews are worshipping.

673
00:43:17,061 --> 00:43:18,619
The one God.

674
00:43:18,696 --> 00:43:24,635
Religion is being used as a mask
to hide the cruelty...

675
00:43:25,369 --> 00:43:28,600
...the ugliness of violence.

676
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:34,508
Moderates, they are the majority,
but their voices are not loud enough.

677
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:37,479
[Morgan] What are your thoughts
on the global war on terror?

678
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:41,644
9/1 1 breaks the hearts
of every human being,

679
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:45,553
but I think the best way
is not to fight only.

680
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:50,322
You have to look for
the root of the problem.

681
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:55,764
What our American brothers
and friends need is a cultural strategy.

682
00:43:56,867 --> 00:44:01,270
Without understanding each other,
without this mutual respect,

683
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:04,171
there's no peace. It's impossible.

684
00:44:04,775 --> 00:44:07,369
Mission is impossible.

685
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:12,182
[Morgan] Not only is it impossible,
it's downright scary.

686
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,274
Just ask journalist Fouad Hussein.

687
00:44:14,351 --> 00:44:18,412
Ten years ago while he was jailed for
criticizing Jordan's economic policies,

688
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:22,084
he met Abu Musab al-Zarqawi,
leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.

689
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:26,027
They remained pen pals
up until Zarqawi was killed in 2006.

690
00:44:26,096 --> 00:44:28,121
According to what Zarqawi told him,

691
00:44:28,198 --> 00:44:30,996
America is playing
right into Al-Qaeda's hands.

692
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:35,672
[in Arabic] Al-Qaeda attacked New York
and Washington on September 1 1th.

693
00:44:35,739 --> 00:44:40,972
Because Al-Qaeda can't fight the U.S. on
its soil, they drew them to Arabic land

694
00:44:41,045 --> 00:44:42,945
so that they will fight them here.

695
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,709
[Morgan] Had we left Afghanistan
and said "That's it."

696
00:44:45,783 --> 00:44:48,809
You know, "We're done."
What would have happened?

697
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:54,483
After Afghanistan, Al-Qaeda
didn't have anywhere to operate.

698
00:44:54,558 --> 00:44:56,048
If the United States
hadn't entered lraq,

699
00:44:56,126 --> 00:44:58,993
Al-Qaeda wouldn't be
the same as they are now.

700
00:44:59,063 --> 00:45:01,258
It would have ended
by the end of Afghanistan.

701
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:03,561
The psychology of the Arabs and Muslims

702
00:45:03,634 --> 00:45:06,432
is to side
with whoever fights the occupier.

703
00:45:08,572 --> 00:45:11,473
If bin Laden would be
caught or killed right now,

704
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:13,737
- would it make any difference?
- Nothing.

705
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:15,142
Nothing whatsoever.

706
00:45:15,212 --> 00:45:18,477
Zarqawi was killed
and nothing happened.

707
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:21,814
And if bin Laden and Zawahiri
got killed, nothing will happen.

708
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:25,412
Because Al-Qaeda has become
an intercontinental idea,

709
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:27,719
the same as globalization.

710
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:32,520
[Morgan] And that idea is reaching
more and more people each day.

711
00:45:32,596 --> 00:45:35,531
With Operation Special Delivery
only seven weeks away,

712
00:45:35,599 --> 00:45:37,328
I need to go back to the beginning.

713
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,564
And the beginning for Osama
is Saudi Arabia.

714
00:45:41,638 --> 00:45:43,970
Saudi Arabia is a country
ruled by one family,

715
00:45:44,041 --> 00:45:48,444
and governed by one brand
of fundamental Islam, Wahhabism.

716
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:51,345
Osama was born here.
He went to school here.

717
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:54,543
And, in the late '70s,
he was radicalized here.

718
00:45:54,985 --> 00:45:58,944
[man in Arabic] O God, one leader
to lead jihad for your sake.

719
00:45:59,022 --> 00:46:01,047
To liberate the land of Palestine.

720
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,059
And the land of lraq
from the Christians.

721
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,560
O God, the strong and noble one.

722
00:46:04,628 --> 00:46:07,028
O God, go after the Christians.

723
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,088
O God, make wars in their homes.

724
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,760
O God, release your armies upon them.

725
00:46:11,835 --> 00:46:15,066
O God, make the land of Palestine
a graveyard for the Jews.

726
00:46:15,139 --> 00:46:18,802
O God, make the land of lraq
a graveyard for the Christians.

727
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:21,401
[Morgan] Do you feel America
is trying to fight a war

728
00:46:21,478 --> 00:46:23,002
against the religion of lslam?

729
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:28,250
[in Arabic] Well, look at what
you did in lraq and Afghanistan.

730
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:31,884
Well, they went to Afghanistan
to get Osama bin Laden.

731
00:46:31,955 --> 00:46:34,287
And the Taliban wouldn't give him up.

732
00:46:34,358 --> 00:46:36,451
Was it an act of aggression or not?

733
00:46:36,527 --> 00:46:38,586
We were seeking peace in Afghanistan.

734
00:46:38,662 --> 00:46:41,324
You went there with an ambulance
or with a tank?

735
00:46:41,398 --> 00:46:43,229
[laughter]

736
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,792
That's a good question. Do you think
Osama bin Laden caused 9/1 1?

737
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:51,432
If one man in a cave
was able to do this...

738
00:46:51,508 --> 00:46:53,999
What if all Muslims were
to resist against America

739
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:55,840
under the leadership of one man?

740
00:46:55,913 --> 00:46:59,644
See, but I don't think 1.2 billion
Muslims think the same way you think.

741
00:46:59,716 --> 00:47:02,241
One single verse from the Koran
and they will come.

742
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:04,480
So why has no one said that verse yet?

743
00:47:04,555 --> 00:47:07,023
These things get planned.
Don't disregard it as unlikely.

744
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:10,992
What if we were to burn the refineries,
just to deprive you of the oil?

745
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:20,563
[Morgan] You said Saudi Arabia
is a country divided.

746
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:21,865
What do you mean by that?

747
00:47:21,939 --> 00:47:27,502
Not divided, but not yet building
the national unity we are looking for.

748
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:31,241
One important issue in the Kingdom,
is to organize the relation between

749
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:34,773
the religious establishment
and the political establishment.

750
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:38,185
This issue hasn't been resolved yet,
and it must be resolved.

751
00:47:38,255 --> 00:47:43,659
Otherwise, extremists, terrorists, may
dictate some of their ideologies on us.

752
00:47:43,727 --> 00:47:47,754
And we still have so many people,
who are refusing to accept the reality.

753
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:50,197
Are there still radicals
within the country?

754
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:53,794
We still have a lot.
And they are dangerous, by the way.

755
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:58,205
We should not underestimate
the ability of the extremists.

756
00:47:58,275 --> 00:48:02,143
Those people are ready to die.
Those people are ready to destroy.

757
00:48:02,646 --> 00:48:06,047
Those people are ready
to kill themselves, kill their families,

758
00:48:06,116 --> 00:48:08,482
they don't care about life.

759
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,113
Therefore, I think they are
a threat us, in Saudi Arabia,

760
00:48:12,189 --> 00:48:14,714
then to other countries,
then to the world.

761
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:18,660
[man] In an unprecedented
nine month operation

762
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:22,221
netting more than
170 Al-Qaeda suspects,

763
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:24,233
and more than five million dollars,

764
00:48:24,301 --> 00:48:27,293
Saudi intelligence officials
say they thwarted plans

765
00:48:27,371 --> 00:48:31,705
to fly aircraft into oil facilities,
attack security installations,

766
00:48:31,775 --> 00:48:36,337
kill senior officials
and send money to Al-Qaeda in Iraq.

767
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:40,372
But the raids reveal a far more
worrying trend for the Saudis.

768
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:44,477
The war in Iraq is spilling over
into Saudi Arabia.

769
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:53,660
Right in front of the head office
of the Mutawwa'un, the religious police,

770
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:56,563
is Chop Chop Square.
I'm standing right on the drain

771
00:48:56,633 --> 00:48:58,430
where they...
[makes slicing noises]

772
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:01,835
...cut people's heads off,
and the blood goes into that drain.

773
00:49:01,905 --> 00:49:04,373
Everybody stands around and watches.

774
00:49:04,441 --> 00:49:06,636
They kill people
in the morning and then

775
00:49:06,710 --> 00:49:09,736
play soccer in the afternoons.

776
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,246
What a place.

777
00:49:12,616 --> 00:49:16,279
[Morgan] It's complete culture shock
for me to be in Saudi Arabia.

778
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:19,789
An absolute other world,
from anything I've ever experienced,

779
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:21,153
any place I've ever been.

780
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:26,389
We've been to Egypt and Morocco and
Jordan, and the Palestinian territories,

781
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:30,331
and these places are
so progressive by comparison.

782
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,595
There is no separation
of church and state.

783
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:34,933
Church is the state,
state is the church.

784
00:49:35,005 --> 00:49:38,133
The religion and the ideology
is what runs everything.

785
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:43,002
Boys and girls separated
from the time they're ten.

786
00:49:44,581 --> 00:49:47,141
You can't see La Perla's brassiere ad.

787
00:49:47,217 --> 00:49:51,085
That's wrong. Oh, you can't
see Posh Spice's shoulder.

788
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,349
You can't see the knee or the thigh.

789
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:56,017
- Can't I police my own thoughts?
- No.

790
00:49:56,093 --> 00:49:59,153
[Morgan] That's the problem
when a country's built entirely on

791
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:02,756
marriage between church and state.
There isn't much room for moderates.

792
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,427
There's no freedom of speech
or freedom of the press,

793
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:09,131
speaking or writing anything
critical of the royal family is illegal.

794
00:50:09,206 --> 00:50:11,572
Public protest is actually forbidden.

795
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:15,372
The Ministry of Information monitors
the Web for any immoral content,

796
00:50:15,445 --> 00:50:19,313
but websites supporting Al-Qaeda
seem to get through just fine.

797
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,851
[Morgan] What do fundamentalists
hope to achieve?

798
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:24,978
Power in the name of God.
That's where I don't like it.

799
00:50:25,055 --> 00:50:27,319
They manipulate the lslamic teachings

800
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:30,326
to fit different situations,
different conditions,

801
00:50:30,394 --> 00:50:32,760
- to, ultimately, lead them to power.
- Yeah.

802
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:37,266
I don't think a religious person,
be it Christian, Jewish or Muslim,

803
00:50:37,334 --> 00:50:42,237
by his own upbringing and teaching,
is qualified to be a public official.

804
00:50:42,305 --> 00:50:47,743
He's just not. Politics is
completely different from religion.

805
00:50:48,512 --> 00:50:52,380
I don't think any religious person
is qualified to be a public official.

806
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:58,445
A good amount of secularism in every
Arab political system is badly needed.

807
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:02,151
Drawing clear lines
between where an lmam,

808
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,853
a priest role, a responsibility ends,

809
00:51:04,928 --> 00:51:08,830
and a politician, or a
public official's responsibility begins.

810
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,628
We need it for stability.

811
00:51:11,535 --> 00:51:14,834
I'd love to hear your thoughts
on Osama bin Laden.

812
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,033
Osama bin Laden, per se,
is not the problem.

813
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,235
The school of thought, the followers,

814
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:24,110
the teaching that he has planted
in lslamic countries,

815
00:51:24,181 --> 00:51:25,614
in the Muslim world,

816
00:51:25,682 --> 00:51:28,879
is where the restructuring
and the fight should begin.

817
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:32,820
It's unfortunate, but he is a product
of the system, the establishment.

818
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:36,052
There's no denying that.
We have to accept that.

819
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:39,721
[Morgan] I went to a school to find what
kids are being taught about the west.

820
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:42,492
[ Jon Spurney: School Days]

821
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:48,199
[Morgan] These two young,
open-minded, free-thinking students,

822
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,729
picked by the administration,
are the two I'm allowed to speak to.

823
00:51:51,808 --> 00:51:56,074
Understanding that their teacher and
principal be present the whole time.

824
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:57,408
[Morgan] How old are you guys?

825
00:51:57,481 --> 00:51:58,539
[man in Arabic] Eighteen.

826
00:51:58,615 --> 00:51:59,912
Eighteen, yeah.

827
00:51:59,983 --> 00:52:03,111
So how is it being 1 8 in Saudi Arabia?

828
00:52:03,186 --> 00:52:05,586
[in Arabic] Great.

829
00:52:05,655 --> 00:52:08,886
We have no worries or troubles.

830
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:12,554
What did you learn about the
United States while you were in school?

831
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,765
Actually, we did not study

832
00:52:15,832 --> 00:52:19,632
the United States specifically.

833
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:23,662
What's your opinion
of the United States?

834
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:29,571
I have no definite opinion...
no specific opinion.

835
00:52:29,646 --> 00:52:32,114
I'm just curious
what you think about the U.S.

836
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:36,915
In the United States we hear
one idea about Muslim countries,

837
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:40,388
Saudi Arabia is where
the hijackers came from.

838
00:52:40,457 --> 00:52:43,824
Saudi Arabia is the country
that...

839
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:45,862
...makes a lot of money off of oil.

840
00:52:45,929 --> 00:52:49,421
So I'm curious what you guys
hear about the United States.

841
00:52:50,267 --> 00:52:51,291
No answer.

842
00:52:51,368 --> 00:52:53,666
You have no answer? No? How about you?

843
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:58,335
Their view is...

844
00:52:58,408 --> 00:53:04,404
Americans always want to dominate...

845
00:53:05,715 --> 00:53:10,345
No, that was the wrong answer...

846
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:17,189
One of the things we hear a lot
in the United States,

847
00:53:17,260 --> 00:53:22,027
is that there's a lot of anti-Western,
or anti-Semitic things taught in school.

848
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:24,589
What are you taught about lsrael?

849
00:53:25,135 --> 00:53:27,000
[man in Arabic] Stop your cameras.

850
00:53:27,070 --> 00:53:29,630
- What's wrong? I'm sorry?
- They want to stop.

851
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:32,140
- They want to stop the whole thing?
- Yes.

852
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:33,870
OK. [laughs]

853
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:43,276
How are you to have a discussion,
if he can't talk about things?

854
00:53:43,353 --> 00:53:46,516
How are things supposed to change
if you can't address them?

855
00:54:10,914 --> 00:54:13,906
Excuse me, I was wondering
if we could ask you a question?

856

Excuse me, I was wondering
if you guys could help me?

No?

858
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:24,888
Could I ask you guys a question? No?

859
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:30,866
Do you know anybody who could
get me in touch with Osama bin Laden?

860
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:34,131
Osama bin Laden?
[in Arabic] No, I have no leads.

861
00:54:35,805 --> 00:54:39,639
It's becoming more obvious,
Osama never went to the mall.

862
00:54:42,946 --> 00:54:45,210
- So this is a good moisturizer?
- [woman] Yeah.

- Yeah.

- Where can I find Osama bin Laden?
- What?

865

- You saw him?
- Yes.

- [laughing]
- Was he down past the Nutella?

868

Is he in Saudi Arabia?

- Maybe.
- Maybe. OK.

870

Maybe you can ask his family.
Maybe they can help you.

871
00:55:08,438 --> 00:55:10,338
- OK. All right.
- Yeah.

872

- Cool, I'll do that. Thanks. Bye.
- OK. Bye.

00:56:50,473 --> 00:56:53,135
Why is that funny?
What's wrong with that?

899
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,235
- Where is your car?
- Where is my car?

900
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:59,076
Why, you going to blow it up
or something?

901
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:00,309
You want to see it?

902
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:10,925
[Morgan] We're going up
to bin Laden's farm.

903
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:15,563
We're going to go to his place, this
house that he built with his own hands.

904
00:57:15,632 --> 00:57:20,296
We're going to talk to people in the
village, see if somebody can get me in.

905
00:57:20,637 --> 00:57:23,265
[speaking Arabic]

906
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:26,340
- [Morgan] That guy said this was it.
- [man] Yeah.

907
00:57:26,409 --> 00:57:29,139
- Not much of a farm. Look at this.
- Yeah.

908
00:57:30,246 --> 00:57:32,976
It's like a trailer park.

909
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,482
This must be the house.

910
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,855
Let's go. Let's get out of here.

911
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,863
Man, I should have bought some sandals.

912
00:57:57,440 --> 00:57:58,964
[Morgan] Well, I didn't find OBL,

913
00:57:59,042 --> 00:58:01,306
or any good clues in
the desert of Saudi Arabia.

914
00:58:01,377 --> 00:58:03,777
But that night I did find
Othman Ya al Bari,

915
00:58:03,847 --> 00:58:06,042
who's related to
one of the 9/1 1 hijackers.

916
00:58:06,115 --> 00:58:08,777
Hopefully, he could point me
in the right direction.

917
00:58:08,852 --> 00:58:12,379
He's got professional wrestling on TV,
he knows what's good, see?

918
00:58:12,455 --> 00:58:15,185
One of your relatives
was said to be one of the hijackers.

919
00:58:15,258 --> 00:58:17,852
- [in Arabic] Yes.
- Yeah. Was he?

920
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:20,422
No.

921
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:24,692
After 9/1 1, there was video

922
00:58:24,767 --> 00:58:28,863
of a lot of the hijackers.
A lot of them released video statements.

923
00:58:28,938 --> 00:58:33,568
Do you not think that connects them
in some way to what happened?

924
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:38,511
I don't believe that is solid proof.
America wins all the Oscar awards.

925
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:42,347
It owns the best studios
and technologies in the world.

926
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:46,354
We've seen the animals,
the lion, the dog and the pig,

927
00:58:46,422 --> 00:58:49,585
we've seen them in many movies
talking like humans.

928
00:58:50,293 --> 00:58:53,820
I feel very uncomfortable
with this conversation.

929
00:58:53,897 --> 00:58:57,697
What do you think
would drive some people

930
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:00,327
towards wanting to join
a group like Al-Qaeda?

931
00:59:00,403 --> 00:59:04,703
What would make them want to go off
and fight, possibly lose their lives?

932
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:09,267
They go because they feel
like America...

933
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:11,506
you feel like...

934
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:13,742
She's trying all kinds
of ways to dominate

935
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:16,148
and impose her dominance
on the entire world,

936
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:18,210
especially on the Muslim world.

937
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:22,349
Have you had friends who
have gone off to wage jihad?

938
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:23,983
Yes, of course.

939
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,352
Where did they go?

940
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:29,057
These youth went first to Afghanistan.

941
00:59:29,132 --> 00:59:33,034
Then America went into lraq,
and they followed.

942
00:59:33,102 --> 00:59:35,002
How many people do you know that went?

943
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,164
- A lot.
- [man] A lot.

944
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:41,072
And how many have come back?

945
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,309
Unfortunately, nobody came back.

946
00:59:46,783 --> 00:59:48,751
[beeping]

947
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:04,533
[Morgan] Afghanistan is a country at war
for more than 30 years,

948
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,727
and it feels like it.

949
01:00:12,208 --> 01:00:15,541
From when the Soviet Union invaded,
to civil war, to the Taliban,

950
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,046
and now the arrival
of U. S. and NATO forces,

951
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:20,105
its impact is everywhere.

952
01:00:20,183 --> 01:00:23,778
Wherever you go there's barricades,
barbed wire, people with guns,

953
01:00:23,853 --> 01:00:25,844
checkpoints, more people with guns.

954
01:00:28,658 --> 01:00:32,219
And, in the middle of all this,
is just this incredible poverty.

955
01:00:34,597 --> 01:00:37,657
I thought the first place to look
in Afghanistan for Osama

956
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:41,602
was the last place that he was seen.
So we're heading out to Tora Bora.

957
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:49,210
They say, "No, no,
it's not dangerous at all,"

958
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:53,942
yet there's 21 guys here with guns...
[laughs] taking us to Tora Bora.

959
01:00:54,017 --> 01:00:57,214
"No, it's fine. You're not gonna
need to worry about it at all."

960
01:00:57,286 --> 01:00:59,686
[Arabic music plays]

961
01:01:11,367 --> 01:01:14,165
Are there a lot of landmines
in this area?

962
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:16,000
[in foreign language]
No, not on the path...

963
01:01:16,072 --> 01:01:17,972
- Really?
- Really.

964
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:19,664
OK.

965
01:01:22,645 --> 01:01:26,342
[Morgan] So, this area here, this
was the beginning of Al-Qaeda's base?

966
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:30,978
[man in Arabic] This is where
Osama's headquarters was.

967
01:01:31,054 --> 01:01:33,887
There are large caves on this
side and the other side too.

968
01:01:33,956 --> 01:01:39,826
They were full of ammunition, weapons,
and food such as tea, sugar and rice.

969
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:42,524
Look, up there, should we go?

970
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:45,696
One of our soldiers
is shaking the nuts off the tree,

971
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:48,703
'cause, apparently,,
if you eat 20 of these nuts...

972
01:01:49,672 --> 01:01:51,731
All night long.

973
01:01:51,808 --> 01:01:55,107
It's the word on the street.
You can rock and roll all night.

974
01:01:56,079 --> 01:02:00,106
Look at that, we got a guy
up in the tree to get the magic nuts.

975
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,115
Dude, look at that.

976
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:07,213
While these guys are playing with their
nuts, I think I'll head out on my own.

977
01:02:27,376 --> 01:02:31,403
President Bush said that he wanted to
capture Osama bin Laden dead or alive.

978
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:34,575
The U. S. had its best chance
in late November of 2001,

979
01:02:34,650 --> 01:02:37,175
when elements of both
Afghan and American forces

980
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,778
closed in on Osama's mountain hideout.

981
01:02:39,856 --> 01:02:43,587
The following days saw some of the
heaviest fighting in all of the war.

982
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:47,390
Yoo-hoo! Osama!

983
01:02:47,463 --> 01:02:50,296
And, rather than commit
additional U. S. ground forces,

984
01:02:50,366 --> 01:02:53,927
the U. S. chose to rely on local
Afghan fighters to bring in OBL.

985
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:56,995
When the dust had settled,
Osama was gone.

986
01:02:57,073 --> 01:03:00,770
The governor of the province has
ideas how to bring the excitement back.

987
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:03,903
[in foreign language] Our plan
and goal is that Tora Bora

988
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:06,710
should become an international
tourism center.

989
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:10,742
So we want to build a grand
amusement park in Tora Bora.

990
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:11,878
What kind of rides?

991
01:03:11,988 --> 01:03:12,977
Everything will be built.

992
01:03:13,055 --> 01:03:14,044
Maybe a roller coaster.

993
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:15,112
Everything will be built.

994
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:16,954
- Water slides?
- Absolutely.

995
01:03:17,026 --> 01:03:20,086
- Ferris wheels? All of it?
- Yes. Yes.

996
01:03:20,163 --> 01:03:22,597
You could say,
"Tora Bora. It's the bomb."

997
01:03:22,665 --> 01:03:25,896
[crickets chirping]

998
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:28,960
[Morgan] I'm not sure how much fun
Afghanistan is ready for.

999
01:03:30,506 --> 01:03:34,499
Seems to me they could use a lot more
than just roller coasters around here.

1000
01:03:38,748 --> 01:03:42,081
[in foreign language] No one
has done anything for us.

1001
01:03:42,151 --> 01:03:45,951
All the international aid
goes to those at the top.

1002
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:47,011
It never makes its way down to us.

1003
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,886
You got a tent from the UN.

1004
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:50,653
No, we bought it
in the black market!

1005
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:54,162
- No, we buy it in the black market.
- [laughing]

1006
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:59,497
They haven't helped us with land,
money or to fix our tent or anything.

1007
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:04,264
Look at this troublemaker!
When we're traveling at night,

1008
01:04:04,340 --> 01:04:08,504
we have to constantly check the camel to
make sure we didn't leave him somewhere.

1009
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:09,875
Have you left him behind before?

1010
01:04:09,946 --> 01:04:12,847
Yeah, all the time!

1011
01:04:12,915 --> 01:04:14,439
We've lost them many times!

1012
01:04:14,517 --> 01:04:17,452
Our lives already passed. We are
concerned about our children.

1013
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,318
They should be able
to have a better life.

1014
01:04:22,825 --> 01:04:24,554
[man] The international community

1015
01:04:24,627 --> 01:04:27,061
is failing to help this country
get on its feet.

1016
01:04:27,129 --> 01:04:31,657
Organizations such as USA gauge success
by how much money they spend.

1017
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:33,759
Not by what it achieves.

1018
01:04:33,836 --> 01:04:36,896
The bigger budget they have,
the more impressed they are.

1019
01:04:36,973 --> 01:04:40,670
The fact that it doesn't achieve
anything, all the clinics don't exist,

1020
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:44,770
no one seems to care back in the States,
that information doesn't get there.

1021
01:04:47,483 --> 01:04:49,576
[in foreign language]
No one is helping this place,

1022
01:04:49,652 --> 01:04:51,415
and if there is,
no one is distributing it.

1023
01:04:53,956 --> 01:04:59,417
There are more than 800 houses
here but no school or hospital.

1024
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:04,762
We are living the same now
as we were under the Taliban.

1025
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:07,894
America must hold
our government accountable.

1026
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:12,634
America must ask why didn't you pave
the streets with the money we gave you.

1027
01:05:14,944 --> 01:05:18,072
All those houses were destroyed
by foreign countries.

1028
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:21,014
Why don't they rebuild those houses?

1029
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:23,551
They haven't done
anything positive here.

1030
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,831
Two years ago, the U.S. Ambassador
came here and said,

1031
01:05:38,901 --> 01:05:42,530
"We're going to make a pledge to rebuild
the school." It's been two years.

1032
01:05:42,605 --> 01:05:45,267
Look at this place.
This is hearts and minds.

1033
01:05:45,341 --> 01:05:47,366
It looks like a bomb went off yesterday.

1034
01:05:48,110 --> 01:05:52,274
There's bullet holes. The front of the
building is riddled with bullet holes.

1035
01:05:52,348 --> 01:05:53,940
Blast holes.

1036
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:57,713
Nothing's being done.

1037
01:05:58,788 --> 01:06:00,949
We've got to do something
for these kids.

1038
01:06:01,023 --> 01:06:04,925
We've gotta do something for these kids
to say, "Somebody cares about us.

1039
01:06:04,994 --> 01:06:07,292
Somebody cares about
us getting educated.

1040
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:10,059
Somebody wants us
to be in a safe environment."

1041
01:06:14,503 --> 01:06:17,631
[Morgan] As somebody about to
become a father for the first time,

1042
01:06:17,707 --> 01:06:22,110
it's so instilling in me, reminding me,
of the things that I want for my family.

1043
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:26,848
I don't ever want my child to be in
a position where they can't be educated.

1044
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:30,909
Or can't feel like they can better
themselves, like that this is it.

1045
01:06:30,987 --> 01:06:33,387
That this is as good
as it gets for their life,

1046
01:06:33,456 --> 01:06:36,550
and to not have hope
that tomorrow is going to be better.

1047
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:46,702
- [phone ringing]
- Ow.

1048
01:06:46,702 --> 01:06:48,897
- [phone ringing]
- Ow.

1049
01:06:48,971 --> 01:06:52,065
Man, this baby starts kicking
as soon as your phone rings.

1050
01:06:52,908 --> 01:06:55,035
- Baby knew I was calling.
- We miss you.

1051
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:57,204
Baby knew. Ow!

1052
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:59,975
- Oh, I miss you so much.
- Yeah. Me, too.

1053
01:07:00,816 --> 01:07:02,807
[Morgan] I dreamt we had
a girl last night.

1054
01:07:02,885 --> 01:07:04,477
[woman] That's cute.

1055
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:16,491
[Morgan] Ever see
Osama bin Laden around here?

1056
01:07:16,565 --> 01:07:18,999
[in foreign language] God know,
if we catch him, we will tear him apart.

1057
01:07:19,068 --> 01:07:22,196
Osama bin Laden's Afghan's enemies.

1058
01:07:24,874 --> 01:07:26,341
[in foreign language] Who is Osama?

1059
01:07:26,409 --> 01:07:29,640
He is the one who destroyed
those buildings in America.

1060
01:07:29,712 --> 01:07:31,873
Fuck him.
And fuck America.

1061
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,918
I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.

1062
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:39,887
- Pakistan.
- Pakistan?

1063
01:07:39,955 --> 01:07:41,718
- Pakistan.
- OK!

1064
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:44,355
Pakistan? Pakistan.

1065
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:46,418
[in foreign language]
It is very obvious to the world

1066
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:47,587
that he is hiding in Pakistan.

1067
01:07:47,663 --> 01:07:50,928
You should find him
so we have peace in the world.

1068
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,995
[Morgan] I'm looking for
Osama bin Laden.

1069
01:07:55,104 --> 01:07:57,163
[in foreign language] Tribal area.

1070
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,399
Near Peshawar?

1071
01:07:58,474 --> 01:08:01,500
[heart beat on speaker]

1072
01:08:01,577 --> 01:08:03,704
That is so cool.
I love you so much.

1073
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:05,747
I love you too, baby.

1074
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,016
[imitating heartbeat]

1075
01:08:08,084 --> 01:08:10,382
That was my baby's
little disco heartbeat.

1076
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:17,025
What will happen if I go
to Pakistan to look for him?

1077
01:08:17,093 --> 01:08:18,720
[in foreign language]
You will find him.

1078
01:08:18,794 --> 01:08:19,783
I will find him?

1079
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:23,731
You want to come look for him with me?

1080
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,502
No? [laughing]

1081
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:30,129
Why not?

1082
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:34,298
I'll miss my family.

1083
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:37,072
- [man] I'm gonna miss my family.
- You'll miss your family.

1084
01:08:37,146 --> 01:08:38,511
I miss my family very much.

1085
01:08:40,182 --> 01:08:42,650
If I went into the tribal area,
you think I'd be OK?

1086
01:08:42,718 --> 01:08:46,085
[in foreign language] God knows
what will happen if you go there.

1087
01:08:46,155 --> 01:08:48,988
Something terrible will happen to you.

1088
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:52,051
You're finished.

1089
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:54,153
The Taliban will cut your head.

1090
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:56,460
- They'll cut my head? Yeah.
- Yeah.

1091
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:58,530
Ugh!

1092
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:03,034
So Alex started getting
contractions last night.

1093
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:07,474
Braxton Hicks contractions,
which aren't real contractions,

1094
01:09:07,543 --> 01:09:10,637
but it's your body
preparing for a contraction.

1095
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:12,348
And, here I am, missing it all.

1096
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:14,248
And, here I am, missing it all.

1097
01:09:14,316 --> 01:09:17,410
Missing it all, man, missing it all.

1098
01:09:17,486 --> 01:09:19,454
[man singing in Arabic]

1099
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,593
[Morgan] We just found out from U.S.
military that we can go out on an embed.

1100
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:40,199
And it's frightening. But the most
important thing, for me, is to try and,

1101
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:43,245
hopefully, just narrow down the path

1102
01:09:43,312 --> 01:09:47,305
to finding the most wanted man
on the planet.

1103
01:09:47,383 --> 01:09:51,547
How much they're actually looking for
this guy, who knows? But we'll find out.

1104
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:54,584
This stuff is so heavy.

1105
01:09:59,728 --> 01:10:04,131
Everything in your body tells you
you shouldn't be going to a job,

1106
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,499
or doing something where you
gotta wear a bulletproof vest.

1107
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:14,331
[man] The next thing
you'll see here in America...

1108
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,774
...you'll see terrorism.

1109
01:10:20,249 --> 01:10:23,548
If you don't think you'll see,
you're blinding yourself to the

1110
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:28,113
historic development of everything
taking place on this earth.

1111
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:37,860
Terrorism.

1112
01:10:39,969 --> 01:10:41,231
Terrorism.

1113
01:10:41,303 --> 01:10:45,535
[man] First of all, I'd like to welcome
all of you guys to Firebase Apache.

1114
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:48,668
- What questions do you have?
- Will we be able to speak

1115
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:52,703
to any of the people in the area
who actually live in the local villages?

1116
01:10:53,115 --> 01:10:56,243
Um, when you go out to 4-2, yeah.

1117
01:10:56,318 --> 01:10:58,809
- There's a village right next to them.
- OK.

1118
01:10:58,887 --> 01:11:02,345
And that village also happens
to be full of Taliban.

1119
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:06,053
[woman] I'd like to remind you, while
talking about going outside the wire.

1120
01:11:06,128 --> 01:11:09,564
When whoever we're with, whoever's
escorting us says, "Let's go,"

1121
01:11:09,632 --> 01:11:12,897
get in the vehicle and go.
It doesn't mean finish your question.

1122
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:14,526
It means go now.

1123
01:11:14,603 --> 01:11:17,731
[Leppert] This is hardcore
Taliban country, let me tell you.

1124
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:21,874
Over those mountains,
that's Afghanistan.

1125
01:11:21,944 --> 01:11:25,004
If you go over those mountains,
that's Pakistan.

1126
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:28,140
We're centrally located
with a lot of activity around us.

1127
01:11:28,217 --> 01:11:30,344
[Morgan] Will we stop
in a village tomorrow?

1128
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:33,252
- Yes, we will.
- What's the plan for the afternoon?

1129
01:11:33,322 --> 01:11:36,780
We're fogbound, we'll test fire
weapons, talk, whatever you want.

1130
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:37,951
You've got free rein.

1131
01:11:50,539 --> 01:11:52,837
I had a lot of grouping
right beside the guy.

1132
01:11:53,676 --> 01:11:56,406
Well, if nothing else,
it scared the hell out of him.

1133
01:11:57,746 --> 01:11:59,611
Can I try a rocket launcher?

1134
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,696
[laughing] That was awesome.

1135
01:12:15,764 --> 01:12:18,790
You've been here six months.
You might be able to tell me.

1136
01:12:18,867 --> 01:12:20,095
Where is Osama bin Laden?

1137
01:12:20,169 --> 01:12:22,433
[Leppert] We ask that
every time we go out.

1138
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:28,204
"Hey? You guys know where Osama's at?"
They always point up to the mountains.

1139
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:29,938
[in foreign language] Where's Osama?

1140
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,809
[laughter]

1141
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:34,872
- [Morgan] Where's Osama bin Laden?
- I have no clue.

1142
01:12:34,950 --> 01:12:35,939
Is he alive?

1143
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:38,077
Even if he was,
I don't think we'd know.

1144
01:12:44,727 --> 01:12:49,687
We are going to stop
and speak to villagers.

1145
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:53,030
They said I should
write my blood type on

1146
01:12:53,102 --> 01:12:57,436
anything that'd be attached to me.

1147
01:12:58,974 --> 01:13:01,067
Scary as shit, man.

1148
01:13:01,877 --> 01:13:05,779
What we're concentrating on
is your security. That's it.

1149
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:08,408
In a firefight I'm going to come in.

1150
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:11,942
Come to this effect, bring you in
and we'll grab you to here.

1151
01:13:12,020 --> 01:13:14,853
As soon as I do,
I'm going to try to grab you again.

1152
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:17,585
As soon as it's safe,
then we're going to move out.

1153
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:21,925
When we go out, we expect to have
contact. We expect to get shot at.

1154
01:13:21,997 --> 01:13:25,558
Anything goes out there. We always
got to be ready for everything.

1155
01:13:42,184 --> 01:13:44,652
[man] This is what we call
a "friendly village."

1156
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,848
[laughter]

1157
01:13:47,923 --> 01:13:51,086
[man] Once they understand
it's their choice to talk,

1158
01:13:51,160 --> 01:13:52,718
the forces will stand back.

1159
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:56,128
And then whoever wants to talk to you
will talk to you.

1160
01:13:56,198 --> 01:13:58,325
[man] Morgan, come up,
let's introduce you.

1161
01:13:58,400 --> 01:13:59,867
Yes, sir.

1162
01:13:59,935 --> 01:14:01,732
[in foreign language]
This person is a civilian

1163
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:03,772
from America and wants
to ask you some questions.

1164
01:14:03,839 --> 01:14:06,899
His name is Morgan.

1165
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,443
[Morgan] I was hoping you could
tell me your thoughts

1166
01:14:09,511 --> 01:14:11,979
on the Taliban and
the current conflict happening.

1167
01:14:12,047 --> 01:14:13,446
[in foreign language]
What do you think,

1168
01:14:13,515 --> 01:14:14,914
who is happy with battles?
No one is happy with battles.

1169
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:17,952
We are not happy.

1170
01:14:18,020 --> 01:14:21,217
We don't like the war.
We want a peaceful life.

1171
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:24,555
We are neither your friends nor the
Taliban's. We just want a simple life.

1172
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:28,062
What are things, when you look
at your village, you need the most?

1173
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:29,324
In terms of assistance.

1174
01:14:29,398 --> 01:14:34,233
The most important problem
is the lack of water.

1175
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:37,431
Before the base drilled their well

1176
01:14:37,506 --> 01:14:40,566
we didn't have any water problems.

1177
01:14:40,642 --> 01:14:43,167
- What do you think of Osama bin Laden?
- [man] Morgan!

1178
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:45,713
Let's go now! Now!

1179
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:49,407
- Come on!
- Let's go now!

1180
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:58,751
[man on radio] Be advised, I've
just been informed of an ambush,

1181
01:14:58,827 --> 01:15:01,193
possibly the governor's convoy.

1182
01:15:01,263 --> 01:15:04,790
[man 2] And we are in pursuit
of two individuals on foot.

1183
01:15:10,272 --> 01:15:15,266
Jedi-1, we're at 2-0-6. That village to
our left is where the Taliban went to.

1184
01:15:21,483 --> 01:15:23,314
We have one downed Taliban.

1185
01:15:23,385 --> 01:15:26,013
We have their motorcycle
in our possession. Over.

1186
01:15:34,329 --> 01:15:38,789
[Morgan] People have said Afghanistan is
a winnable war. What are your thoughts?

1187
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:41,358
In counter-insurgency,
killing doesn't work.

1188
01:15:41,436 --> 01:15:45,133
Got to work on the center of gravity,
the people.

1189
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:48,005
They like having clean water,
having a medical clinic.

1190
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:50,544
They like seeing
their kids go to school.

1191
01:15:50,612 --> 01:15:53,672
It just makes it more difficult
for the Taliban to change the tide

1192
01:15:53,749 --> 01:15:55,239
and get the people
to go to the other side.

1193
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,785
[in foreign language] Thank you
and please tell your commander

1194
01:15:57,853 --> 01:15:58,911
the father of Taza Gui
says peace.

1195
01:15:58,987 --> 01:16:02,980
[Morgan] What would have happened if
we had sent more troops here in 2002?

1196
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:05,788
You would have killed more Taliban,

1197
01:16:05,861 --> 01:16:08,694
but, I mean, we're killing
a lot of Taliban right now.

1198
01:16:08,764 --> 01:16:12,860
And they've got the open sieve
from the madrassas of Pakistan

1199
01:16:12,935 --> 01:16:17,338
in the refugee camps that go to
these young kids who don't have a job,

1200
01:16:17,406 --> 01:16:21,672
who have no positive outlook in life.
They sell them with a lot of propaganda.

1201
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:25,406
Tell them they're going to give
their family money, bring them here.

1202
01:16:25,480 --> 01:16:27,846
- Where is Osama?
- I think he's in Pakistan.

1203
01:16:27,950 --> 01:16:29,941
[beeping]

1204
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:40,184
I think it's quite likely
that Osama bin Laden is in Pakistan.

1205
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:43,322
[woman] The latest intelligence
has always seemed to indicate

1206
01:16:43,398 --> 01:16:45,025
that he is in Pakistan.

1207
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:47,864
[man] He's probably somewhere
along that border region.

1208
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:50,404
- Pakistan.
- Along that border.

1209
01:16:50,472 --> 01:16:52,133
Tribal areas of Pakistan.

1210
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:55,074
Senior leadership,
number one and two are there.

1211
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:59,375
On the Pakistan border it's particularly
dangerous, a region where terror rules.

1212
01:16:59,448 --> 01:17:02,747
And where many believe
Osama bin Laden could be hiding.

1213
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:07,018
Everyone I've spoken to
said this is where Osama's hiding out.

1214
01:17:07,089 --> 01:17:09,785
[Morgan] Everyone, that is,
except for Pakistanis.

1215
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:11,553
- Where is Osama?
- [Morgan] You tell me.

1216
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,790
- Where is Osama?
- I'm looking for him. You tell me.

1217
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:16,387
[in foreign language]
He's in Afghanistan.

1218
01:17:16,465 --> 01:17:18,160
Osama bin Laden is here.

1219
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:19,222
Afghanistan.

1220
01:17:19,301 --> 01:17:21,394
Osama bin Laden...

1221
01:17:21,470 --> 01:17:23,301
Which animal is that?

1222
01:17:23,372 --> 01:17:27,331
I don't where he is, but it's also
a question if he's alive or dead.

1223
01:17:27,409 --> 01:17:30,845
But, um, his influence is here.

1224
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:33,444
[in foreign language] He is
a great soldier of the Muslims.

1225
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:36,177
He is fighting for righteousness.

1226
01:17:36,251 --> 01:17:38,082
He's a diamond.

1227
01:17:38,153 --> 01:17:40,144
Osama is exploiting the root causes.

1228
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:44,090
If we find the root causes,
we'll solve everything.

1229
01:17:44,159 --> 01:17:47,822
- Osama bin Laden is nothing, sir.
- He is only one! One person!

1230
01:17:49,031 --> 01:17:53,161
Dude, look at that.
Even in Pakistan they love wrestling.

1231
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:56,966
- All the people like the wrestling.
- Tell me why you like wrestling.

1232
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:01,305
- Because wrestling is fair.
- Can I let you in on a little secret?

1233
01:18:01,376 --> 01:18:02,570
- It's fixed.
- Fixed?

1234
01:18:02,644 --> 01:18:04,908
- Fixed. It's not real.
- Maybe.

1235
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,710
- You are right. I know. You are right.
- OK. Good.

1236
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:11,719
But when it is for a belt,

1237
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:13,379
then it is not fixed.

1238
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:19,585
I'm looking, uh... How are you?

1239
01:18:20,162 --> 01:18:22,096
How are you? Hi.

1240
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:23,688
I'm just looking...

1241
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:28,864
[Morgan] Just based on what everybody
has said, I got to think we're within

1242
01:18:28,937 --> 01:18:32,236
a couple hundred miles of where he is.
Maybe even less.

1243
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:34,571
Yeah, OK. OK. Thank you.

1244
01:18:44,019 --> 01:18:47,887
Tomorrow we're heading into
this area of the tribal regions,

1245
01:18:47,956 --> 01:18:53,053
just past Peshawar, where everyone
has told me Osama bin Laden is.

1246
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:58,360
I mean, I have no idea
what to expect when I get there.

1247
01:19:02,337 --> 01:19:06,205
I've been traveling for months
to try and find this person

1248
01:19:06,274 --> 01:19:11,871
that everybody we talk to...
You know, they all say,

1249
01:19:11,947 --> 01:19:16,350
"Why are you looking for this person?
What is he? He's one man?"

1250
01:19:18,787 --> 01:19:21,551
The thing that I've realized
is that this whole trip

1251
01:19:21,623 --> 01:19:27,186
is a chance to actually go out
and see and talk to those people

1252
01:19:27,262 --> 01:19:30,060
that we're told to be
so scared of all the time.

1253
01:19:30,699 --> 01:19:33,668
I'm not somebody who thinks we can
sit around the campfire

1254
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:36,932
and sing Kumbaya, you know?
That's ridiculous.

1255
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:38,996
[laughing]

1256
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:44,273
But I believe that we create
these demons within ourselves.

1257
01:19:44,346 --> 01:19:46,746
And we create these demons
within the media.

1258
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:51,514
And we create these visions
that are so beyond reality.

1259
01:19:52,187 --> 01:19:54,621
They start feeding themselves
after a while.

1260
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:58,250
Our fear just becomes exponential.

1261
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:17,210
They say when you go
looking for trouble, you'll find it.

1262
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:20,976
It's not that I'm looking for trouble.
I'm just looking for answers.

1263
01:20:21,049 --> 01:20:23,040
And I think I've found a lot.

1264
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:26,286
I think I've found a lot on this trip.

1265
01:20:27,022 --> 01:20:30,514
"Attention. Entry of foreigners
is prohibited beyond this point."

1266
01:20:32,961 --> 01:20:35,589
Even if I go over the border
to find Osama,

1267
01:20:35,664 --> 01:20:38,895
it's not going to, suddenly,
make the world safer for my kid.

1268
01:20:38,967 --> 01:20:42,266
The things that are pushing people
to follow him and his ideas

1269
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:45,738
are still going to be there.
And that's what we have to change.

1270
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:50,041
I think that we need
to take a step back...

1271
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:55,510
...and really ask ourselves, "What kind
of a world do we want to live in?

1272
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:58,216
What do we want that world to be?"

1273
01:21:04,059 --> 01:21:06,254
It's not worth it.

1274
01:21:17,839 --> 01:21:20,637
So her water just broke,
which is very exciting.

1275
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:23,109
So, I'm that much closer.

1276
01:21:27,582 --> 01:21:29,914
- OK.
- OK? You want to get up?

01:21:50,438 --> 01:21:53,669

- [laughter]

1283
01:22:00,815 --> 01:22:02,874
[Morgan] So,
I didn't end up finding Osama.

1284
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:06,079
What I did find, is that there
are a lot more people out there

1285
01:22:06,154 --> 01:22:09,123
who are just like us,
than there are who are just like him.

1286
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:13,388
I'll always bet on the billions of
regular people to win over the crazies.

1287
01:22:13,461 --> 01:22:16,589
After all, we all want
the same things for our families.

1288
01:22:16,665 --> 01:22:20,294
We want the world to be a place
where we can raise and love our kids.

1289
01:22:20,368 --> 01:22:23,701
Where they can have everything
they need to be happy, healthy,

1290
01:22:23,772 --> 01:22:25,763
without it blowing up around them.

1291
01:22:26,074 --> 01:22:30,238
It's not going to be easy. And all that
reward money sure would have helped but,

1292
01:22:30,312 --> 01:22:34,339
