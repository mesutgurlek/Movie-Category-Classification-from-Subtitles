1
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:41,233
<i>And in accordance with my
orders to remain undetected,</i>

2
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:44,303
<i>stayed on bottom additional six hours</i>

3
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:47,907
<i>after sonar reported convoy had passed</i>

4
00:02:47,984 --> 00:02:51,249
<i>in order to ensure not
being sighted or detected</i>

5
00:02:51,321 --> 00:02:54,188
<i>by possible trailing destroyer.</i>

6
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,954
<i>Ford, James A, Seaman First Class,</i>

7
00:02:58,027 --> 00:03:01,258
<i>badly injured by accident
in forward torpedo room.</i>

8
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:06,496
<i>Paul Stevenson. Commander, US Navy.</i>

9
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:54,115
That water's cold.

10
00:03:54,951 --> 00:03:57,749
Cold. Cold water, warm heart.

11
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:05,524
Who said warm? It's a fire.

12
00:04:07,030 --> 00:04:09,931
That's a pure chemical reaction, lady.

13
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,593
One part you, one part me.

14
00:04:13,503 --> 00:04:15,596
You put the two together...

15
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:30,415
I see what you mean.

16
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:38,826
Is that what they train you for
at Underwater Demolition School?

17
00:04:38,895 --> 00:04:41,125
That's classified information.

18
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,894
Let's you and I get back to
tactical maneuvers on dry land.

19
00:04:53,977 --> 00:04:57,640
What's the matter, don't you
want to learn about strategy?

20
00:04:58,448 --> 00:05:01,417
No, Ken, it isn't that. It's just that...

21
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,519
Well, something just happens

22
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:11,324
and suddenly I feel all
the fight going out of me.

23
00:05:11,394 --> 00:05:12,861
That's good.

24
00:05:15,631 --> 00:05:17,496
Ken, we've only known each other a week.

25
00:05:17,567 --> 00:05:19,057
And two days.

26
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:22,928
All right. A week and two days.

27
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:30,144
And yet I feel I really don't
know anything about you at all.

28
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:34,214
I'm classified information, too.

29
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:38,576
Kenneth M. Braden, Lieutenant
JG, United States Navy.

30
00:05:38,654 --> 00:05:42,750
246772. Name, rank and serial number.

31
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,323
And where have you been
all my young, lonely life?

32
00:05:54,704 --> 00:05:56,695
I'm beginning to wonder.

33
00:05:58,174 --> 00:06:00,404
It isn't like there wasn't a war.

34
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:04,207
Other people make up your mind
for you. You're being trained.

35
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:09,648
But for what? Where do you go and when?

36
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,318
Questions, questions, questions.

37
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:15,818
- You know what I think?
- What?

38
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:17,587
You talk too much.

39
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:39,404
You don't mind that song
following us, do you?

40
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:47,079
- Have enough to eat?
- It was delicious.

41
00:06:47,156 --> 00:06:49,283
- Like the wine?
- Delicious.

42
00:06:51,928 --> 00:06:53,589
- Sally.
- Yes, Ken.

43
00:06:55,598 --> 00:06:57,589
You had enough to eat?

44
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:03,234
Delicious. And so was the
wine and I love that song.

45
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,566
Good.

46
00:07:08,077 --> 00:07:11,740
You know the beach maneuvers
I was using this afternoon?

47
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:17,646
Well, I wasn't trying to
establish just any old beachhead.

48
00:07:18,955 --> 00:07:21,287
What are you trying to say, Ken?

49
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:24,458
Well, I guess I don't say it very well.

50
00:07:26,629 --> 00:07:30,360
Well, you spend a lot of sleepless nights

51
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,224
rehearsing the words

52
00:07:32,301 --> 00:07:35,759
and picking just the right
time and the right place,

53
00:07:35,838 --> 00:07:38,568
then when you get there it's...

54
00:07:42,345 --> 00:07:44,540
Well, all I'm trying to say is

55
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:49,682
I love you. I want to marry you.

56
00:07:54,991 --> 00:07:56,891
I say something wrong?

57
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,486
No.

58
00:07:59,695 --> 00:08:01,959
You didn't say anything wrong.

59
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:06,265
I just don't know what to think.

60
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,500
You're not supposed to
think at a time like this.

61
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:11,904
You're just supposed to say yes.

62
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:20,678
- Dance with me, Ken, before I start to cry.
- Sure.

63
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:24,085
I just didn't know you
were gonna be so upset.

64
00:08:24,554 --> 00:08:27,682
Well, it isn't every day
a girl gets proposed to.

65
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:31,993
It isn't every day I ask a girl to marry me.

66
00:08:48,711 --> 00:08:51,271
And maybe I'm kidding myself.

67
00:08:51,347 --> 00:08:54,180
Maybe I'm the only one who feels this way.

68
00:08:54,884 --> 00:08:58,047
- Don't say that.
- What else can I say?

69
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,560
You see? I don't have to say anything.

70
00:09:10,499 --> 00:09:13,991
You say it all yourself without
ever having to speak a word.

71
00:09:15,705 --> 00:09:17,696
It isn't what you think.

72
00:09:19,442 --> 00:09:21,876
You don't tell me what you think.

73
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:30,208
If I told you that I loved you, too?

74
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:34,556
That isn't saying you'll marry me.

75
00:10:05,388 --> 00:10:08,084
- What's going on?
- Are you Lieutenant Braden?

76
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:11,024
- That's right.
- I'm getting your gear out.

77
00:10:12,128 --> 00:10:14,961
Got orders to get you packed
and out to the airport.

78
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:17,295
You sure you got the right Braden?

79
00:10:19,602 --> 00:10:21,297
One "N" in Braden?

80
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:24,664
- Two "N's" in Kenneth?
- That's right.

81
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:28,542
Narrows the field considerably, doesn't it?

82
00:10:28,611 --> 00:10:31,808
- Hey, I got time for a phone call?
- I'm sorry, sir.

83
00:10:32,014 --> 00:10:34,141
No calls. Skipper's orders.

84
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:03,804
<i>No smoking.</i>

85
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:07,076
<i>Pearl Harbor in five
minutes. Fasten safety belts.</i>

86
00:11:10,019 --> 00:11:11,008
Hey.

87
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:12,716
Seatbelt.

88
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,876
Lieutenant JG Kenneth Braden, reporting.

89
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:36,775
Just a moment, Lieutenant.

90
00:11:36,846 --> 00:11:39,508
<i>- Yes.
- Lieutenant Braden is here, Captain.</i>

91
00:11:39,582 --> 00:11:41,413
<i>- Send him in, please.
- Yes, sir.</i>

92
00:11:41,484 --> 00:11:43,952
- All right, you can go in.
- Thanks.

93
00:11:46,922 --> 00:11:48,822
Lieutenant. Sit down.

94
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:50,318
Thank you, sir.

95
00:11:50,393 --> 00:11:53,851
- How was your flight from California?
- Very good, sir.

96
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,962
Do you have any idea why you're here?

97
00:11:57,032 --> 00:11:59,262
Well, the duty officer at
Underwater Demolition School

98
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:00,529
tapped me on the shoulder

99
00:12:00,603 --> 00:12:02,434
and next thing I know
I'm on a plane to Pearl.

100
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:03,836
Surprised?

101
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,204
It's a volunteer outfit, sir.

102
00:12:07,777 --> 00:12:11,269
I realize they were gonna
call on me sooner or later.

103
00:12:11,347 --> 00:12:13,406
I just wish it had been later.

104
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:15,449
On account of the girl?

105
00:12:16,185 --> 00:12:17,482
The girl?

106
00:12:17,787 --> 00:12:19,277
Sally Johnson.

107
00:12:19,789 --> 00:12:21,620
- You know her?
- No.

108
00:12:22,425 --> 00:12:25,861
You met her about a week
ago. "A week and two days. "

109
00:12:26,462 --> 00:12:29,625
- Give or take an hour or two.
- "It started out routine.

110
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:33,998
"Dinner, a couple of drinks, dancing.
Took her to the beach, swimming.

111
00:12:35,137 --> 00:12:38,334
"Then the usual beach maneuvers. Proposed. "

112
00:12:38,407 --> 00:12:41,205
You proposed again. You got tapped.

113
00:12:41,277 --> 00:12:42,904
Now you're here.

114
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:47,537
- You look confused, Lieutenant.
- I am, sir.

115
00:12:48,517 --> 00:12:50,644
Simple. Security screening.

116
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:54,752
Miss Johnson works for the
Office of Naval Intelligence.

117
00:12:54,824 --> 00:12:56,758
You were her assignment.

118
00:12:56,826 --> 00:12:58,259
Coffee?

119
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:00,090
No, thank you, sir.

120
00:13:00,296 --> 00:13:02,423
Other members of your
class were screened, too,

121
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:05,524
but Miss Johnson's report made you top man.

122
00:13:06,402 --> 00:13:09,735
- She classified me 1A?
- You might say that.

123
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,700
That's fine.

124
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:16,267
I've fallen in love with a
girl and she's sending in a...

125
00:13:16,912 --> 00:13:18,345
Must've had a lot of fun.

126
00:13:18,414 --> 00:13:20,814
I don't think so. She fell in love, too.

127
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:23,908
Was that in the report?

128
00:13:24,286 --> 00:13:27,221
Reports are pretty complete, Lieutenant.

129
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:29,849
Nobody in this war has an easy job.

130
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,987
Supply has all your gear
ready. You pick it up.

131
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,554
Be at Pier 5 tomorrow and
report to Captain Stevenson

132
00:13:36,632 --> 00:13:37,963
<i>aboard the Barracuda.</i>

133
00:13:38,033 --> 00:13:39,660
- Is that all, sir?
- Yes.

134
00:13:40,102 --> 00:13:43,162
- Good luck.
- Thank you very much, sir.

135
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:54,683
<i>- Glenn.
- Yes, sir.</i>

136
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,514
<i>- Is Captain Stevenson still here?
- No, sir.</i>

137
00:13:57,586 --> 00:14:00,453
<i>He went over to Naval Hospital
with Seaman Ford's wife, sir.</i>

138
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:16,035
He's dead.

139
00:14:26,048 --> 00:14:28,312
Oh, no.

140
00:14:30,553 --> 00:14:32,020
Oh, no.

141
00:14:32,087 --> 00:14:33,884
No, no, no.

142
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:42,923
Oh, no.

143
00:14:42,998 --> 00:14:44,932
No, no.

144
00:15:11,427 --> 00:15:12,826
Yeah!

145
00:15:13,696 --> 00:15:17,097
Oh, brother, that Malone
sure swings a mean rudder.

146
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:19,691
- Come on, Peck, drink it up.
- Sure. I'll drink to Ford.

147
00:15:19,768 --> 00:15:22,464
- Why don't you knock it off?
- Easy.

148
00:15:22,871 --> 00:15:24,532
Shove off, Floyd.

149
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:29,004
I still say you don't sit
your tail on the bottom

150
00:15:29,078 --> 00:15:31,103
as long as we did after that convoy passed.

151
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:33,341
I say if we left, Ford would still be living.

152
00:15:33,415 --> 00:15:34,643
So the skipper played it safe.

153
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:36,207
What are you worrying about? You got back.

154
00:15:36,285 --> 00:15:38,753
I might be Ford some day.

155
00:15:38,821 --> 00:15:39,879
You all might.

156
00:15:39,955 --> 00:15:41,752
Go ahead, drink your drink. Forget it.

157
00:15:41,824 --> 00:15:44,122
- Maybe you can. I can't.
- Me, neither.

158
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:46,957
And I got news for you, Chief, a lot
of the other guys feel the same way.

159
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:49,691
You know, argue, argue. That's
all you guys do is argue.

160
00:15:49,765 --> 00:15:52,290
- You all blame it on the skipper?
- Who else?

161
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,598
You don't think laying there
breathing in all that stinking air

162
00:15:54,670 --> 00:15:56,194
did Ford any good, do you?

163
00:15:56,271 --> 00:15:57,397
Right, Ash?

164
00:15:58,340 --> 00:15:59,864
Maybe. I don't know.

165
00:15:59,942 --> 00:16:02,342
You mean, not bringing him up
topside sooner wouldn't have helped?

166
00:16:02,411 --> 00:16:03,605
Might have.

167
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:06,113
Well, putting him on a plane
and getting him back to Pearl

168
00:16:06,181 --> 00:16:07,876
wouldn't have helped save his life?

169
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:09,747
Look, how do I know?

170
00:16:10,285 --> 00:16:12,515
I'm only a pharmacist mate,

171
00:16:12,888 --> 00:16:14,321
not God.

172
00:16:19,828 --> 00:16:21,819
Oh, come on, Billy. Let's have some fun here.

173
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,455
Come on, drink it up.

174
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:26,899
That Malone sure swings a mean rudder.

175
00:16:40,716 --> 00:16:41,842
<i>Long distance.</i>

176
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,317
Long distance, I want to
place a person-to- person call

177
00:16:44,386 --> 00:16:47,355
to Miss Sally Johnson in San
Diego, California, please.

178
00:16:47,423 --> 00:16:49,891
<i>I'm sorry, sir. Unless you
have a military priority,</i>

179
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,324
<i>there are no long distance
calls going through to the States</i>

180
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:55,090
<i>- for the next 24 hours.
- 24 hours?</i>

181
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:58,162
<i>- Operator, there's a war on.
- Do tell.</i>

182
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:00,599
<i>There's nothing I can do about it.</i>

183
00:17:00,669 --> 00:17:02,068
Yeah, yeah.

184
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:19,111
Scotch, please.

185
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:25,819
- Encore!
- Encore!

186
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:30,027
- You promised to dance with me next.
- No, sweethearts.

187
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:32,499
No argument. It shall be
as I said, but not now.

188
00:17:32,568 --> 00:17:35,128
Bartender, give me a beer with a rum chaser.

189
00:17:35,204 --> 00:17:38,196
Lieutenant, your money's
not any good in here tonight.

190
00:17:38,273 --> 00:17:40,002
This is my welcome home party.

191
00:17:40,075 --> 00:17:42,339
- Thanks, mister, but...
- Not Mr. But.

192
00:17:42,411 --> 00:17:45,812
Malone. Pat Malone. Been an ensign
in the navy for fifteen years.

193
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:47,906
- Ken Braden. Welcome home, Ensign.
- Thank you.

194
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,247
Yes, welcome home. Be it ever so humble.

195
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:54,415
And I believe in sharing my
blessings. Lieutenant Braden, girls.

196
00:17:55,124 --> 00:17:57,183
This is
Mui-Mui, Moy-Moy

197
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,159
and Oi-Oi.

198
00:17:59,228 --> 00:18:00,855
How are you doing?

199
00:18:00,929 --> 00:18:02,624
Well, come on, girls.
Now run along and relax.

200
00:18:02,698 --> 00:18:04,222
Oh, no, sweethearts,

201
00:18:04,299 --> 00:18:05,493
there's enough of Malone for everybody.

202
00:18:05,567 --> 00:18:08,502
Go on, now. Patience. Patience, sweetheart.

203
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:09,730
Bye.

204
00:18:11,807 --> 00:18:15,004
A man of ambition, Mr. Malone.
I'll predict you'll go far.

205
00:18:15,110 --> 00:18:16,577
Already have been.

206
00:18:16,979 --> 00:18:20,380
Fifty-seven days out and
most of it underwater.

207
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:21,677
Ambitious?

208
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:25,086
I've hardly got a conscience left.

209
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,846
To the remnants of your
conscience, Mr. Malone.

210
00:18:31,059 --> 00:18:32,356
Our exec.

211
00:18:36,965 --> 00:18:40,992
Oh, Mr. Carney, have we got some
nice fish and poi here tonight.

212
00:18:41,069 --> 00:18:44,561
Better start learning
to like navy chow again.

213
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:46,431
Your attention, men!

214
00:18:47,176 --> 00:18:49,269
Mr. Carney. Welcome aboard!

215
00:18:49,378 --> 00:18:51,175
Come on and join the party.

216
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:53,114
Simmer down.

217
00:18:53,649 --> 00:18:56,140
Drink up. All leaves and liberty canceled.

218
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,445
Oh, no.

219
00:18:59,521 --> 00:19:01,250
Report back to the boat immediately.

220
00:19:01,323 --> 00:19:03,223
Now, of course, sir. Phil, sir.

221
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:05,351
You and I know this is
just a pleasant little joke.

222
00:19:05,427 --> 00:19:07,691
We will end up on land tomorrow,
each in our own little wiki

223
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:10,027
with our own gorgeous little hangover.

224
00:19:10,265 --> 00:19:12,062
Oh, well, come on. Say we will.

225
00:19:12,134 --> 00:19:14,864
I wish that's how it was, Pat,
but that's not how it's gonna be.

226
00:19:14,937 --> 00:19:16,370
Let's move it, men!

227
00:19:17,439 --> 00:19:20,237
- You're not gonna do this to me again.
- Let's go!

228
00:19:21,276 --> 00:19:22,709
Malone, do you really have to go?

229
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,143
- Please don't leave us.
- What about our dance?

230
00:19:24,213 --> 00:19:26,374
- Now, girls, girls.
- Oh, no.

231
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:29,349
Let's face this situation
with a brave little smile.

232
00:19:29,685 --> 00:19:32,711
- Come, children.
- But, Mr. Malone, you promised.

233
00:19:32,821 --> 00:19:36,279
Patrick Malone always keeps his
promises, one way or the other.

234
00:19:39,795 --> 00:19:42,127
And now I've saved these up.

235
00:19:43,699 --> 00:19:46,930
Lieutenant, sir, be my
guest. They're all paid for.

236
00:19:47,002 --> 00:19:49,664
- Well, thank you, Ensign.
- You're welcome.

237
00:19:50,205 --> 00:19:52,264
Well, girls, goodbye.

238
00:19:53,609 --> 00:19:54,871
Mui-Mui.

239
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,039
Oi-Oi.

240
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,642
Moy-Moy.

241
00:20:00,849 --> 00:20:02,339
Well, goodbye.

242
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:05,014
<i>- Aloha, Mr. Malone.
- Aloha, Mr. Malone.</i>

243
00:20:05,087 --> 00:20:06,520
<i>Yeah, aloha.</i>

244
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,318
<i>- Aloha.
- Aloha.</i>

245
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:23,035
Well, now, girls, gather around.

246
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:26,768
That's better, isn't it?

247
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:29,844
Let me see.

248
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:33,207
- Moy-Moy.
- Oi-Oi.

249
00:20:33,282 --> 00:20:35,944
- Now, well, that doesn't matter, does it?
- No.

250
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:37,642
Well, now.

251
00:20:41,924 --> 00:20:44,392
Can I have another Scotch, please?

252
00:20:49,698 --> 00:20:51,256
Easy.

253
00:20:55,237 --> 00:20:56,568
Mr. Malone!

254
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,567
- Yeah!
- Last one!

255
00:21:01,143 --> 00:21:04,635
- Secure all the loading hatches, York!
- Aye, aye, sir.

256
00:21:09,851 --> 00:21:12,752
Torpedoes are all loaded. Food,
fuel, and supplies are all checked in.

257
00:21:12,821 --> 00:21:13,879
Good.

258
00:21:13,956 --> 00:21:16,424
Now we sit and wait for
our passenger to show.

259
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:21,258
Yeah, if this passenger service works out,
you suppose we'll get the mail contracts?

260
00:21:23,765 --> 00:21:25,096
Wow.

261
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:27,158
There's a sewer pipe I'd
give up a month's leave

262
00:21:27,235 --> 00:21:29,669
and a little black book full of
telephone numbers to serve on.

263
00:21:29,738 --> 00:21:33,071
<i>Well, you could do worse
than the Barracuda, Pat.</i>

264
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:37,077
<i>Sure, Phil. I could get a transfer
to the Monitor or the Merrimack, too.</i>

265
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:42,477
It must be a sweet feeling
coming home with your

266
00:21:43,118 --> 00:21:45,450
keel chalked up and tubes empty

267
00:21:45,988 --> 00:21:48,889
and letting them know that you
swept a lot of dirt to the bottom.

268
00:21:48,957 --> 00:21:52,085
Now, us. Wouldn't hurt a fly, us wouldn't.

269
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,720
We'll be waving a broomstick
of our own one of these days.

270
00:21:54,796 --> 00:21:56,821
Yeah, and I can tell you from where.

271
00:21:56,898 --> 00:21:58,661
I think you made your
point clear, Mr. Malone.

272
00:21:58,734 --> 00:22:01,897
Yes, sir. I'd better double-check
those water lines, sir.

273
00:22:04,106 --> 00:22:07,598
Hey, Peck, Gruber! Give him a
hand on that number four line!

274
00:22:12,381 --> 00:22:15,214
Well, well, well. Lieutenant,
so you're our passenger.

275
00:22:15,283 --> 00:22:16,545
Hello, Malone.

276
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:19,879
And what did you do with
my wine, women and leis?

277
00:22:19,955 --> 00:22:22,981
- They were expendable.
- They were what?

278
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:24,753
Expendable.

279
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:26,657
I'm looking for the duty officer.

280
00:22:26,728 --> 00:22:29,196
Lieutenant, sir, you're
looking at the duty officer.

281
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,858
I'm also the assistant
communications and sound officer,

282
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,424
the assistant to the
assistant approach officer,

283
00:22:34,503 --> 00:22:36,869
the assistant engineering officer,
the assistant diving officer,

284
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,133
the assistant gunnery and torpedo officer.

285
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:41,539
I'm also a mess treasurer without assistant

286
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,874
and a cold hand poker player without peer.

287
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,971
- You're late, Lieutenant.
- I had to wait for my gear, sir.

288
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:49,244
- Where is your gear?
- On the jeep, sir.

289
00:22:49,317 --> 00:22:52,218
- Better see that it gets stowed.
- Yes, sir.

290
00:22:52,287 --> 00:22:54,517
Prepare to get underway in
five minutes, Mr. Carney.

291
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:55,681
Five minutes. Yes, sir.

292
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:57,850
Malone, get a couple of hands
to help you with that gear.

293
00:22:57,926 --> 00:23:00,394
Then station the maneuvering
watch and stand by the lines.

294
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:01,724
Aye, aye, sir.

295
00:23:02,197 --> 00:23:04,631
Captain Bligh has got
quite a bark, hasn't he?

296
00:23:04,699 --> 00:23:06,724
Got all his own teeth, too.

297
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:08,292
Here, Lieutenant, I'll
help you aboard with that.

298
00:23:08,370 --> 00:23:09,701
Thank you.

299
00:23:09,771 --> 00:23:13,172
Lieutenant, did you say they were expendable?

300
00:23:13,842 --> 00:23:14,968
Yeah.

301
00:23:18,513 --> 00:23:22,210
Jerry, Hodins, Gunner, get up here
and get this gear out of the jeep.

302
00:23:47,642 --> 00:23:49,974
Watch your step now, Lieutenant.

303
00:23:54,282 --> 00:23:55,943
This way.

304
00:23:57,185 --> 00:23:59,949
- Mr. Braden, Mr. Doherty.
- Hi.

305
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,687
Now watch your head.

306
00:24:03,758 --> 00:24:05,555
Easy now.

307
00:24:07,496 --> 00:24:10,056
Oh, you're doing fine, Lieutenant, just fine.

308
00:24:10,132 --> 00:24:13,033
Another three or four more
times, you'll hardly even feel it.

309
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,537
- Hey, what's going on? -
Checking the night-lights.

310
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:21,131
- We always run with a red light at night.
- Why?

311
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:24,838
Condition our eyes to the darkness, in
case we have to get topsides in a hurry.

312
00:24:24,913 --> 00:24:26,346
Here we are.

313
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,349
Home.

314
00:24:30,919 --> 00:24:33,888
Note the lavish furnishings and the decor

315
00:24:34,322 --> 00:24:35,755
and the latest plumbing.

316
00:24:35,824 --> 00:24:37,724
Pardon me, Lieutenant.

317
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:42,393
Kind of a gracious, spacious,
spread out type of living.

318
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:44,056
And the comfort, sir.

319
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:48,834
Inner springs. This is where you'll bunk.

320
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,371
Supine, sir?

321
00:24:51,273 --> 00:24:53,571
Good. Here, you may as well try it.

322
00:24:57,345 --> 00:25:00,872
Well, you see, it only costs a
little more to go first class.

323
00:25:01,049 --> 00:25:02,949
Oh, before I forget.

324
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:06,146
The air down here is rationed. We're
supposed to take turns breathing.

325
00:25:06,221 --> 00:25:08,382
- After you, sir.
- Thank you.

326
00:25:14,062 --> 00:25:16,496
- Comfy?
- Yeah, fine.

327
00:25:16,765 --> 00:25:17,891
Good.

328
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:24,232
- Say, Lieutenant.
- Yeah.

329
00:25:24,306 --> 00:25:28,766
Would you mind if we spoke briefly again
about that wine, women and expendables?

330
00:25:28,843 --> 00:25:31,277
Mr. Malone, we're members
of the silent service

331
00:25:31,346 --> 00:25:33,814
and gentlemen don't speak of those things.

332
00:25:33,915 --> 00:25:36,008
Of course not. Sorry, sir.

333
00:25:41,590 --> 00:25:43,490
It's on the right, Lieutenant.

334
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,853
Sit down, Braden.

335
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,130
All right, here's the set-up.

336
00:25:53,201 --> 00:25:56,762
There's a buildup on for an offensive
in the Gilbert and Marshall Islands.

337
00:25:56,838 --> 00:26:01,172
Now, the Japanese have air bases,
sea bases and submarine bases

338
00:26:01,409 --> 00:26:06,403
at Tarawa, Majuro,
Kwajalein, Eniwetok and Truk.

339
00:26:07,315 --> 00:26:09,579
Orders of their local forces,

340
00:26:09,651 --> 00:26:12,313
and right now our particular
interest is submarines,

341
00:26:12,387 --> 00:26:14,287
are beamed to them from a radio transmitter

342
00:26:14,356 --> 00:26:16,449
situated on the island of Kusaie.

343
00:26:16,791 --> 00:26:18,656
We can't break that code.

344
00:26:18,727 --> 00:26:21,719
Our cryptanalysts doubt we
can break it under six months.

345
00:26:21,796 --> 00:26:24,959
That radio station on
Kusaie. That's our mission.

346
00:26:25,634 --> 00:26:26,828
We knock it off?

347
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:29,301
No, we don't want the
island. We just want the code.

348
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:31,464
We need it to know when they're gonna start

349
00:26:31,539 --> 00:26:33,029
and where they're gonna go,

350
00:26:33,108 --> 00:26:36,339
where the submarines are, so we can
feed them information of our own.

351
00:26:36,411 --> 00:26:39,903
Set up decoys, lead them
into traps. Our traps.

352
00:26:40,382 --> 00:26:41,542
When?

353
00:26:42,217 --> 00:26:44,549
- When what?
- The invasion.

354
00:26:46,821 --> 00:26:48,015
Soon.

355
00:26:48,123 --> 00:26:51,251
If we can break that code first,
we're gonna save a lot of ships

356
00:26:51,326 --> 00:26:53,385
and a lot of men.

357
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:56,692
Or is talk of this mission
boring you, Mr. Braden?

358
00:26:56,765 --> 00:27:00,223
- Are we keeping you up, sir?
- Oh, no, sir. I was just thinking.

359
00:27:01,102 --> 00:27:05,334
Now I know why the navy had me
playing commando these last few weeks.

360
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:09,266
Me, I had to go to college
to learn Japanese on my own.

361
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:14,212
Well, school's out, Mr. Braden. My
job is to get you to that island.

362
00:27:14,282 --> 00:27:16,682
Get you on it, get you off and get you back.

363
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:18,844
Here are your instructions.

364
00:27:19,254 --> 00:27:23,520
You're to go ashore unseen. Locate
that radio transmitter, undetected.

365
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:26,887
Leave no evidence, get
the code and photograph it.

366
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:29,759
Come back to your own ship, undiscovered.

367
00:27:30,832 --> 00:27:33,323
There's not much to that
at all, is there, sir?

368
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:35,426
Here's some Japanese language books.

369
00:27:35,503 --> 00:27:39,439
There's a dictionary in there with a
special list of Japanese ideographs.

370
00:27:39,507 --> 00:27:42,943
Noting time, location, ship
types, movement, and geography.

371
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:45,445
There's also a chart made
up by our own cryptanalysts

372
00:27:45,513 --> 00:27:48,676
on what to look for and how to
recognize it when you see it.

373
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:51,378
- Commit that to memory and burn it.
- Yes, sir.

374
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:54,154
Make up an OP plan as soon as possible.

375
00:27:54,222 --> 00:27:56,520
- Submit it to me for approval.
- Yes, sir.

376
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,025
The orders said that you
were picked for this job

377
00:27:59,094 --> 00:28:01,392
because you're the best, Mr. Braden.

378
00:28:01,463 --> 00:28:03,556
I'm to work with you as close as I can.

379
00:28:03,631 --> 00:28:06,191
- Thank you very much, sir.
- What about the crew?

380
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,792
Well, the orders also state
that except for Mr. Braden,

381
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:11,304
nobody except the Captain
and his Executive Officer

382
00:28:11,373 --> 00:28:12,635
shall know the mission.

383
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:16,666
If any word of this plan whatsoever
were to leak to the enemy,

384
00:28:16,745 --> 00:28:19,543
he'd change his code and
set up defensive measures.

385
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,777
It would take twice the blood
this invasion should cost.

386
00:28:23,151 --> 00:28:25,278
All right. That's all, Mr. Braden.

387
00:28:27,155 --> 00:28:29,646
One thing more, Mr. Braden.

388
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:31,724
You don't get captured.

389
00:28:33,595 --> 00:28:35,722
I wouldn't think of it, sir.

390
00:28:41,903 --> 00:28:44,303
Looks like they slipped you
a real hot one this time.

391
00:28:44,372 --> 00:28:45,669
Yeah.

392
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,973
Now, I got a 90-day wonder on my back.

393
00:28:49,244 --> 00:28:52,736
- His job is pretty tough, too.
- Oh, sure, sure.

394
00:28:53,948 --> 00:28:57,440
I'll explain it to the crew. At
beat, they'll owe they hate my guts.

395
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,977
Perfect set-up for a successful
patrol. Just like the last one.

396
00:29:02,757 --> 00:29:04,918
You couldn't help yourself on that one.

397
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:09,362
Somebody else might have said the hell
with secrecy and shot their way out.

398
00:29:09,631 --> 00:29:13,123
- Well, you're not somebody else.
- Yeah, I know. I sat it out.

399
00:29:15,036 --> 00:29:16,765
That's the way you saw it.

400
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,608
One man lost his life.

401
00:29:21,242 --> 00:29:23,005
I lost an entire crew.

402
00:29:24,045 --> 00:29:27,537
And we had to be the one lousy
boat to be around for this mission.

403
00:29:27,615 --> 00:29:29,947
Oh, you know that isn't so, Paul.

404
00:29:30,251 --> 00:29:33,448
You gotta be the one man
that does it by the book.

405
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:35,318
Even when it hurts.

406
00:29:36,458 --> 00:29:38,619
That's why you got picked.

407
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:41,088
Let me ask you something.

408
00:29:41,162 --> 00:29:43,460
If you had been in my shoes,
and you were calling the signals,

409
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:45,692
how would you have played it?

410
00:29:46,568 --> 00:29:48,092
Played it safe.

411
00:29:48,169 --> 00:29:50,831
I didn't ask you that.
Come on, now. Level with me.

412
00:29:50,905 --> 00:29:53,100
What would you have done?

413
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:58,345
I think I would've pulled out sooner.

414
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:03,307
You, the crew and Mrs. Ford.

415
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:05,944
- I'm sorry, Paul. You asked me.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

416
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,750
Look, you better explain to the
men this is another recon mission.

417
00:30:08,823 --> 00:30:12,418
Even if they see a hot target,
it's fingers off the trigger, right?

418
00:30:24,138 --> 00:30:26,766
Sure is a real bright day up here.

419
00:30:26,975 --> 00:30:29,808
Looks like you could see a million miles.

420
00:30:31,613 --> 00:30:35,105
Yes, sir. Real bright day.

421
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:38,580
You figure the Japanese can see us, sir?

422
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,245
That's a good question.

423
00:30:41,456 --> 00:30:45,552
- Sure is a bright day, all right.
- Weary, you've got a broken record.

424
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,422
Yes, sir.

425
00:30:47,629 --> 00:30:50,530
- How come they call you Weary?
- That's my name.

426
00:30:50,832 --> 00:30:52,094
Nickname?

427
00:30:52,233 --> 00:30:54,133
No, sir. My real name.

428
00:30:54,602 --> 00:30:56,763
I'm the youngest of 13 children.

429
00:30:56,838 --> 00:31:00,274
I guess when I was born, my mother
couldn't think of another name.

430
00:31:00,341 --> 00:31:01,865
Anything else for you, gentlemen?

431
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:04,241
- Not a thing. Thank you.
- No, thank you.

432
00:31:04,579 --> 00:31:07,707
Captain say he was gonna
run surfaced all day?

433
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:09,682
That's what he said.

434
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:13,587
Don't worry, you can dive awful
fast if you're scared enough.

435
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:16,488
It isn't that. It just isn't in the book.

436
00:31:16,558 --> 00:31:18,492
It is in his.

437
00:31:18,726 --> 00:31:21,217
You've been sailing with him long?

438
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:23,457
I've been his exec over three years.

439
00:31:24,065 --> 00:31:27,296
Not the friendliest type I ever met.

440
00:31:27,402 --> 00:31:29,165
What's eating him?

441
00:31:29,237 --> 00:31:32,729
- He lost a kid last time out.
- I heard about that.

442
00:31:32,807 --> 00:31:34,331
A real nice kid.

443
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:37,102
- Just married.
- All right, Cy, lets cut it.

444
00:31:37,178 --> 00:31:40,238
Let's bury that last
patrol and keep it buried.

445
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:43,640
Don't you have a little gardening to do?

446
00:31:45,086 --> 00:31:46,383
Oh, yeah.

447
00:31:46,721 --> 00:31:48,712
Thanks for reminding me.

448
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:54,022
What's the matter? He say something wrong?

449
00:31:54,295 --> 00:31:56,456
Good weather. Hope it holds.

450
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,858
How did the Captain take it?

451
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,569
- Take what?
- Losing the kid.

452
00:32:05,907 --> 00:32:07,772
How would you take it?

453
00:32:08,209 --> 00:32:10,643
I don't think I'd sleep very well.

454
00:32:11,746 --> 00:32:13,873
Don't think he does either.

455
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:33,731
Any further orders you want
in the night order book, sir?

456
00:32:33,801 --> 00:32:35,428
Nothing else, Pat.

457
00:32:36,571 --> 00:32:38,971
Nothing about submerging at dawn?

458
00:32:41,476 --> 00:32:43,842
Nothing, Mr. Malone.

459
00:32:43,945 --> 00:32:45,503
Aye, aye, sir.

460
00:32:51,653 --> 00:32:53,678
- Ready to relieve you.
- It's a pleasure.

461
00:32:53,755 --> 00:32:56,588
Standard speed. Three main
engines. Course 2- 0-0.

462
00:32:56,658 --> 00:32:59,286
Right. Anything else I ought to know?

463
00:32:59,594 --> 00:33:01,289
Look at the last page.

464
00:33:33,161 --> 00:33:36,790
How you doing, Lieutenant?
Still cramming for final exams?

465
00:33:36,864 --> 00:33:39,094
I hadn't looked at it quite that way.

466
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:42,568
You know, all that homework,
it's liable to kill you.

467
00:33:42,637 --> 00:33:44,537
These days, what isn't?

468
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:49,140
Well, everybody waiting up for daddy?

469
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,872
- That's nice.
- What's topsides?

470
00:33:51,946 --> 00:33:53,675
Still on the surface.

471
00:33:54,148 --> 00:33:58,380
There's nothing in the Captain's night
order book about submerging at dawn.

472
00:33:59,987 --> 00:34:01,978
Say, Lieutenant.

473
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,021
- May I ask you a personal question?
- Why not?

474
00:34:07,862 --> 00:34:09,853
Are you important people?

475
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,031
Only to my mother.

476
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:16,967
Then how come the skipper is in such
a hurry to get you where you're going?

477
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:18,732
Is he?

478
00:34:19,140 --> 00:34:22,576
He's got to be. You ride
surface during the daylight,

479
00:34:22,744 --> 00:34:25,406
you're just begging for a little
brown bird to fly over and lay an egg

480
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:27,380
right down your conning tower.

481
00:34:27,448 --> 00:34:31,248
And I know I'll be just the happy
slob standing there waiting for him.

482
00:34:31,986 --> 00:34:34,352
You sure you're not important people?

483
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,459
Yeah, I'm sure.

484
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,998
Mui-Mui.

485
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,189
- Night, Mount.
- Yeah.

486
00:35:16,430 --> 00:35:17,829
Night, Lieutenant.

487
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:20,229
Good night, Malone.

488
00:35:22,336 --> 00:35:23,803
Good night, girls.

489
00:35:51,165 --> 00:35:54,657
- You looking for me, Braden?
- About my OP plan, sir.

490
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:57,962
- Is that it?
- Yes, sir.

491
00:35:59,207 --> 00:36:00,640
Come on in.

492
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,446
No, I will not enter the lagoon.

493
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:15,286
Fifteen fathoms.

494
00:36:15,823 --> 00:36:17,484
Not in that water.

495
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:23,326
These back and forth trips are too
risky. I'm sorry, Braden, this won't work.

496
00:36:25,366 --> 00:36:27,698
Do you mind telling me why, sir?

497
00:36:31,372 --> 00:36:32,896
Here's Kusaie Island.

498
00:36:34,141 --> 00:36:36,473
Here's the lagoon you
want me to bring you into.

499
00:36:36,544 --> 00:36:39,012
The entrance could be mined or netted.

500
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:41,344
They could let us in and then
slam the door in our face.

501
00:36:41,415 --> 00:36:43,542
And on that water, a plane
flying over could spot us

502
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,586
maybe a 100, 150 feet down.

503
00:36:45,653 --> 00:36:46,950
We'd be a nice fat duck in a pond.

504
00:36:47,021 --> 00:36:49,854
They'd have us for
breakfast, lunch and dinner.

505
00:36:49,924 --> 00:36:53,155
That means I'd have to swim
in from the seaward side.

506
00:36:53,227 --> 00:36:55,787
Those coral reefs can
chop a man up pretty bad.

507
00:36:55,863 --> 00:36:58,331
They can chop a submarine up pretty bad, too.

508
00:36:58,399 --> 00:37:01,095
So far, you got me taking all the risks.

509
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,762
How close to the reefs
will you bring me, sir?

510
00:37:08,876 --> 00:37:10,309
2000 yards.

511
00:37:10,845 --> 00:37:13,507
I won't take my boat in
less than 60 feet of water.

512
00:37:13,581 --> 00:37:15,674
- 2000 yards...
- That's right, you heard me.

513
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:18,310
Captain, that's a pretty good swim.

514
00:37:18,386 --> 00:37:21,583
With all the gear I have to carry,
distance is the kiss of death.

515
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,557
Mr. Braden, I'm concerned
about a $10 million submarine

516
00:37:24,625 --> 00:37:26,092
and the lives of 80 men.

517
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,526
Navy regulations direct
court-martial proceedings

518
00:37:28,596 --> 00:37:30,689
against any commanding officer

519
00:37:30,765 --> 00:37:34,826
who recklessly exposes his ship
or his men to unwarranted danger.

520
00:37:34,902 --> 00:37:37,132
Now, what would you have me do?

521
00:37:38,706 --> 00:37:41,038
Do you mind if we took off the bar, sir,

522
00:37:41,108 --> 00:37:44,305
and just lay this on the
table between you and me?

523
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:49,312
Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

524
00:37:53,821 --> 00:37:57,416
What do navy regulations say
about a commanding officer

525
00:37:57,491 --> 00:37:58,719
not giving a man proper support

526
00:37:58,793 --> 00:38:01,921
and killing off a mission
before you even start?

527
00:38:02,263 --> 00:38:04,322
I thought you were trained
for this mission, Mr. Braden?

528
00:38:04,398 --> 00:38:07,526
I was trained to do it, not
kill myself on the way in.

529
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:11,365
You went by the book on your last
trip. You wound up burying a man.

530
00:38:11,739 --> 00:38:13,832
You out for the same record this trip?

531
00:38:13,908 --> 00:38:16,399
You can put the bars back on now, Lieutenant.

532
00:38:16,477 --> 00:38:18,877
Work over that plan and bring
it back to me for approval.

533
00:38:18,946 --> 00:38:21,437
- I'm telling you...
- I'm telling you, Braden!

534
00:38:21,782 --> 00:38:23,545
That'll be all.

535
00:38:26,020 --> 00:38:27,282
Yes, sir.

536
00:38:37,098 --> 00:38:38,861
Phil, what's his bearing?

537
00:38:38,966 --> 00:38:41,400
<i>Radar, what's his bearing?</i>

538
00:38:41,469 --> 00:38:44,700
- Off the port quarter.
- Off the port quarter, sir.

539
00:38:44,772 --> 00:38:46,763
He's off the port quarter, sir!

540
00:38:48,676 --> 00:38:50,610
I've got him now, sir.

541
00:38:50,678 --> 00:38:52,043
Stand by to dive.

542
00:38:52,346 --> 00:38:53,973
Stand by to dive.

543
00:38:54,615 --> 00:38:57,778
Can you make out what type he is, Johnny?

544
00:38:57,852 --> 00:38:59,547
No, sir. He's too far.

545
00:39:00,121 --> 00:39:03,613
<i>- How about you, Sloane?
- Me neither, sir.</i>

546
00:39:07,361 --> 00:39:08,885
Moving off.

547
00:39:09,430 --> 00:39:12,263
- He's moving off, sir.
- He's moving off, now, sir.

548
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:14,361
Going.

549
00:39:15,403 --> 00:39:16,768
All clear.

550
00:39:16,971 --> 00:39:18,097
All clear, sir.

551
00:39:18,172 --> 00:39:19,867
All clear, now, sir.

552
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:21,999
Hold the dive. Belay the dive.

553
00:39:22,076 --> 00:39:23,407
Belay the dive.

554
00:39:23,644 --> 00:39:26,238
How long are you gonna keep running surfaced?

555
00:39:26,313 --> 00:39:27,974
Until we get there.

556
00:39:30,017 --> 00:39:34,215
- Crew's getting kind of jumpy.
- I'm sorry, but it's gotta be that way.

557
00:39:34,588 --> 00:39:36,749
Anything else on your mind?

558
00:39:36,991 --> 00:39:38,219
Braden.

559
00:39:38,526 --> 00:39:40,221
What about Braden?

560
00:39:40,694 --> 00:39:43,686
Two thousand yards, Paul, that's a long swim.

561
00:39:43,764 --> 00:39:46,358
It's a hell of a long swim, but
there's nothing else I can do.

562
00:39:46,434 --> 00:39:48,595
Don't you think I'd like to set
my tail right up on the beach

563
00:39:48,669 --> 00:39:52,002
and wait there till he got back?
But I can't, Phil, I just can't.

564
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:55,006
Even if it was you making
that swim, I wouldn't...

565
00:39:55,076 --> 00:39:57,374
I couldn't do it any other way.

566
00:39:58,145 --> 00:40:01,637
No, I guess you couldn't, Paul.

567
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:07,112
It's like I said. You gotta play
it by the book even when it hurts.

568
00:40:07,188 --> 00:40:09,122
Yeah, that's right.

569
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:10,748
Take over, will you?

570
00:40:21,902 --> 00:40:24,894
- How's everything back here, Adams?
- Fine, Captain.

571
00:40:24,972 --> 00:40:27,805
- Smoother than a baby lass.
- What?

572
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:30,469
We're making a good 15 knots, sir.

573
00:40:30,544 --> 00:40:33,672
Hey, Ron, tell Esparge to send
up a 12 SN 7 on the double.

574
00:40:33,747 --> 00:40:37,478
Control Room, send up
a 12 SN 7 on the double.

575
00:40:37,685 --> 00:40:40,153
Come on, baby, make with
the eye. Make with the eye.

576
00:40:40,221 --> 00:40:41,779
Deader than that.

577
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:48,653
I'll take that.

578
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:07,275
We got company.

579
00:41:11,152 --> 00:41:14,349
- Jap plane in the sun.
- Get below. Lookouts, get below!

580
00:41:14,421 --> 00:41:17,913
- Dive the boat. Dive the boat!
- Dive! Dive! Dive!

581
00:41:17,992 --> 00:41:19,892
<i>- Dive!
- Dive!</i>

582
00:41:20,094 --> 00:41:21,186
Get below.

583
00:41:21,962 --> 00:41:25,898
Malone, take her down. Take her down fast!

584
00:41:26,300 --> 00:41:28,734
Murphy, get him below. Get him below.

585
00:41:28,802 --> 00:41:31,396
Easy, easy. Go along.
Keep close to the bulkhead.

586
00:41:31,472 --> 00:41:34,134
Sloane! Sloane! Sloane!

587
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,143
Come on, Murphy. Help me get him down.

588
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,497
I can't make it. Get below,
Murphy. Close the hatch!

589
00:42:05,573 --> 00:42:07,131
- Please, sir...
- Get below!

590
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:08,641
I said get below!

591
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,680
Where's Carney?

592
00:42:24,058 --> 00:42:26,322
- Where's Carney?
- Topside.

593
00:42:26,794 --> 00:42:28,921
Hit. Ordered me to close the hatch.

594
00:42:39,073 --> 00:42:41,871
- Catch her at 55 feet.
- Catch her at 55 feet.

595
00:42:52,586 --> 00:42:54,417
Down periscope.

596
00:42:57,891 --> 00:42:59,791
Continue the dive.

597
00:43:00,461 --> 00:43:03,521
Take her down to 150
feet. Steer course 0-9- 0.

598
00:43:03,597 --> 00:43:05,258
Continue to dive.

599
00:43:06,233 --> 00:43:08,428
Course 0-9-0.
Aye, sir.

600
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:12,131
I watched him as long as I could.

601
00:43:12,206 --> 00:43:14,231
He was floating face down.

602
00:43:14,808 --> 00:43:17,777
He didn't move. That's the last I saw of him.

603
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,509
All right, come on. Give me a hand here.

604
00:43:23,584 --> 00:43:25,211
- Mr. Doherty.
- Yes, sir.

605
00:43:25,953 --> 00:43:28,513
You are now executive officer of the boat.

606
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:32,855
Phil has just been killed.
Hold it steady on course.

607
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:36,458
Steady on course.

608
00:43:40,901 --> 00:43:42,368
<i>This is the Captain speaking.</i>

609
00:43:42,436 --> 00:43:44,734
<i>Lieutenant Carney, our
executive officer, is dead.</i>

610
00:43:44,805 --> 00:43:48,297
<i>I'd like all hands to join me
in a moment of silent prayer.</i>

611
00:44:11,665 --> 00:44:12,654
Oh, my leg.

612
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,132
- All right, take it easy.
- My leg.

613
00:44:14,201 --> 00:44:16,499
- I'm gonna give you a shot.
- That's the navy for you.

614
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,731
When in doubt, give all hands a shot.

615
00:44:20,708 --> 00:44:22,266
How are they, Ash?

616
00:44:22,776 --> 00:44:25,506
Sloane's got a hunk of
shrapnel in his shoulder.

617
00:44:25,679 --> 00:44:29,240
Mr. Mount's got it good. 50-caliber
slug went through his leg.

618
00:44:29,316 --> 00:44:32,149
- Didn't hit the bone, though.
- Stay with it, Cy.

619
00:44:32,219 --> 00:44:35,188
Murphy had a flap of skin
on his head peeled back.

620
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:38,452
- It's not too serious.
- Captain, my fault.

621
00:44:38,992 --> 00:44:42,291
- I shouldn't have left him there.
- No, no, it's not your fault, Murphy.

622
00:44:42,363 --> 00:44:45,526
- I should've dragged him down.
- No, no, he ordered you to go below.

623
00:44:45,599 --> 00:44:48,124
I shouldn't have listened.
I should've gone to him.

624
00:44:48,202 --> 00:44:49,692
- Take it easy.
- It's my fault!

625
00:44:49,770 --> 00:44:51,738
I let him die. I let him die.

626
00:44:51,805 --> 00:44:55,639
The morphine's getting to him,
sir. He'll sleep in some time.

627
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:12,281
<i>Captain, we're heavy, sir.
I can't maintain depth.</i>

628
00:45:13,293 --> 00:45:16,319
<i>- Conning tower, all ahead full.
- All ahead full, sir.</i>

629
00:45:22,236 --> 00:45:23,863
Trouble in the engine room, Captain.

630
00:45:23,937 --> 00:45:26,963
Adams says main air induction
line pouring full stream of water

631
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,371
into engine room bilges.

632
00:45:28,442 --> 00:45:31,070
Cannon shell must have holed the pipe.

633
00:45:31,678 --> 00:45:33,270
Too deep here to sit
around the bottom all night

634
00:45:33,347 --> 00:45:35,372
and bring her up then for repairs.

635
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:39,681
And we don't know what other damage
we may have. Got to find out now.

636
00:45:40,654 --> 00:45:42,087
<i>- Adams?
- Aye, aye, sir.</i>

637
00:45:42,156 --> 00:45:44,090
Close drains. Put the pump in the bilges.

638
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:45,887
<i>- Aye, aye, sir.
- Blow safety tank.</i>

639
00:45:45,959 --> 00:45:47,551
Blow safety tank.

640
00:45:49,863 --> 00:45:52,024
Engine room reports bilges being pumped, sir.

641
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:53,123
Safety blown.

642
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:54,565
Doherty, when you get the command of service,

643
00:45:54,635 --> 00:45:57,001
you better come up fast. We
may have a fight on our hands.

644
00:45:57,070 --> 00:45:58,628
- Sound the general alarm.
- Aye, aye, sir.

645
00:45:58,705 --> 00:46:00,764
Tell the damage control party to stand by.

646
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,502
Damage control party, stand by.

647
00:46:02,576 --> 00:46:04,407
Pass the word. Battle stations, surface.

648
00:46:04,478 --> 00:46:06,070
Battle stations, surface.

649
00:46:06,146 --> 00:46:07,875
All right, surface.

650
00:46:35,142 --> 00:46:36,700
Crack the hatch.

651
00:46:45,986 --> 00:46:48,181
Doherty, take the list off her.

652
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:52,248
Doherty, did you hear
me? Take the list off her!

653
00:46:52,326 --> 00:46:53,486
Can't get it off, Captain.

654
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:56,358
Shell bursts have holed
us on the starboard side.

655
00:46:57,064 --> 00:46:59,794
- Secure blowing number two and vent it.
- Aye, aye, sir.

656
00:46:59,867 --> 00:47:00,959
What's wrong?

657
00:47:01,034 --> 00:47:03,696
Well, try a little prayer
we've only got one tank hit.

658
00:47:07,441 --> 00:47:09,409
Number two flooded, sir.

659
00:47:11,712 --> 00:47:14,112
Well, you must have a direct line.

660
00:47:30,397 --> 00:47:31,921
Radar, what do you see?

661
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,631
All clear.

662
00:47:34,968 --> 00:47:36,526
<i>All clear, sir.</i>

663
00:47:37,538 --> 00:47:40,666
- Mind if I go down on deck, sir?
- Yeah, go ahead.

664
00:47:42,042 --> 00:47:43,976
Adams, how does it look?

665
00:47:44,244 --> 00:47:46,474
Captain, we got some of the damage spotted.

666
00:47:46,547 --> 00:47:49,607
We can plug those main induction
holes with wooden plugs,

667
00:47:49,683 --> 00:47:52,413
but I don't know what it's
like below the water line.

668
00:47:52,486 --> 00:47:54,283
Go ahead, plug it up.

669
00:47:54,655 --> 00:47:58,147
Clint. Go below and get a
couple of BARs up on deck.

670
00:47:58,225 --> 00:48:00,125
They'll be around again.

671
00:48:00,193 --> 00:48:04,653
Nothing they'd like better than a little
cold turkey limping back to Midway.

672
00:48:05,365 --> 00:48:08,198
You think Thanksgiving will be a
little early this year, Captain?

673
00:48:08,268 --> 00:48:09,701
Yeah, maybe.

674
00:48:11,505 --> 00:48:14,099
All right, gun crews, look sharp now!

675
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:17,737
- Lieutenant Braden.
- Yes, sir.

676
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:19,574
I wanna talk to you.

677
00:48:22,049 --> 00:48:24,244
I still got that boat ride to make with you,

678
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:26,411
but I couldn't outrun a dead fish if I had to

679
00:48:26,486 --> 00:48:28,545
and I can't take the risk
of going back to Midway.

680
00:48:28,622 --> 00:48:30,715
That leaves just one choice.

681
00:48:30,824 --> 00:48:34,089
Somebody's gotta go underneath the
boat, see how bad the damage is.

682
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:36,254
I've been trained for that, sir.

683
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,525
- If we're attacked...
- Yes, sir.

684
00:48:38,599 --> 00:48:41,796
You save the boat and the
men. I understand that.

685
00:48:42,469 --> 00:48:43,458
Do you?

686
00:48:43,537 --> 00:48:45,027
The way you read me the book the other night,

687
00:48:45,105 --> 00:48:47,266
I think I can recite it from memory.

688
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:49,434
I assume nothing's changed.

689
00:48:49,743 --> 00:48:52,644
That's right, Lieutenant. Nothing's changed.

690
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:55,380
I'll get my gear, sir.

691
00:49:07,461 --> 00:49:10,658
- How's it coming?
- This is the last one here, sir.

692
00:49:11,098 --> 00:49:12,531
Let's still keep everything crossed

693
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:14,533
they don't write this one
up as Stevenson's folly.

694
00:49:14,601 --> 00:49:15,829
Yes, sir.

695
00:49:36,823 --> 00:49:38,290
Bogey. Bogey.

696
00:49:39,026 --> 00:49:40,357
Bogey, Captain.

697
00:49:40,794 --> 00:49:43,661
<i>- Any identification signals?
- No, Captain.</i>

698
00:49:43,830 --> 00:49:45,161
Sound general quarters.

699
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,928
All hands except the gun crews
clear the decks and bridge.

700
00:49:48,001 --> 00:49:49,298
Sound general quarters.

701
00:49:49,369 --> 00:49:52,770
All hands except the gun
crews clear bridge and decks.

702
00:49:52,873 --> 00:49:54,465
Get down below. On the double.

703
00:50:04,017 --> 00:50:06,577
<i>Radio reports plane
transmitting voice, Captain.</i>

704
00:50:06,653 --> 00:50:09,281
<i>Only word he can make out is Hinoshi.</i>

705
00:50:09,456 --> 00:50:10,616
Radio Bridge, aye.

706
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:13,023
That's a Japanese destroyer class.

707
00:50:17,831 --> 00:50:20,129
Got him off the port bow, sir.

708
00:51:31,138 --> 00:51:35,040
<i>Pharmacist mate, Pharmacist mate.
To the bridge, on the double.</i>

709
00:51:35,642 --> 00:51:37,507
A nervous way to make a living.

710
00:52:10,577 --> 00:52:12,841
- I'm proud of you, Malone.
- All right. Get him below.

711
00:52:12,913 --> 00:52:14,437
- Nice shooting, Pat.
- Thank you, sir.

712
00:52:14,514 --> 00:52:16,414
Give me a hand here.

713
00:52:18,952 --> 00:52:21,182
That Japanese flyboy
never would have died happy

714
00:52:21,254 --> 00:52:23,484
unless he got the full word out on us.

715
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:26,788
We're too close to our destination to
chance discovery by a destroyer now.

716
00:52:26,860 --> 00:52:29,522
We gotta move out of here and move out fast.

717
00:52:29,596 --> 00:52:31,860
- Lieutenant?
- Yes, sir.

718
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:34,724
- How did you make out below?
- I finished.

719
00:52:34,935 --> 00:52:36,562
Will those patches hold?

720
00:52:36,636 --> 00:52:39,867
You're gonna worry yourself
into an early grave, Doherty.

721
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:44,138
Captain to engine room. All ahead
full. Lookouts, keep your eyes open.

722
00:52:59,492 --> 00:53:00,720
Contact.

723
00:53:00,894 --> 00:53:04,455
Range 1, 5000. Must be a ship.

724
00:53:04,598 --> 00:53:05,758
Contact, Captain.

725
00:53:05,832 --> 00:53:07,322
<i>Range 1, 5000.</i>

726
00:53:09,903 --> 00:53:14,431
<i>High speeds cruise,
Captain. Bearing 2-5-9.</i>

727
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:17,475
<i>Sounds like a destroyer. Closing in fast.</i>

728
00:53:18,144 --> 00:53:20,772
Clear the deck! Clear the
bridge! Clear the bridge!

729
00:53:20,847 --> 00:53:22,439
- Come on! Come on!
- Guide the boat.

730
00:53:22,515 --> 00:53:25,075
Take her down fast, catch her at 60 feet.

731
00:53:25,318 --> 00:53:26,979
<i>Dive! Dive! Dive!</i>

732
00:54:00,687 --> 00:54:02,780
- Keep the squawk box open.
- Aye, aye, sir.

733
00:54:02,856 --> 00:54:04,187
Hold her at 60 feet.

734
00:54:04,257 --> 00:54:05,417
Hold her at 60 feet.

735
00:54:05,492 --> 00:54:08,256
- Left full rudder.
- Left full rudder. Aye, sir.

736
00:54:14,167 --> 00:54:16,727
- Rudder is left full, sir.
- Very well.

737
00:54:26,146 --> 00:54:27,977
Keep the periscope up.

738
00:54:29,649 --> 00:54:31,310
Keep periscope up.

739
00:54:31,584 --> 00:54:33,677
<i>- What's your bearing
mark? - Twenty-two.</i>

740
00:54:33,753 --> 00:54:34,845
<i>Range mark?</i>

741
00:54:34,921 --> 00:54:37,253
When we should run, we sit.

742
00:54:37,324 --> 00:54:38,655
<i>Ten thousand.</i>

743
00:54:38,725 --> 00:54:41,751
When we should sit, what
do we do, huh? We play tag.

744
00:54:41,828 --> 00:54:43,159
Gruber, you writing again?

745
00:54:43,229 --> 00:54:46,164
I was only writing my girl how lousy I feel.

746
00:54:46,232 --> 00:54:47,324
Yeah, pretty good.

747
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:50,301
What are you laughing at? You doing
all right with that eating routine, too.

748
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,167
Yeah, I don't do bad.

749
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:05,180
Adams, drain all the
diesel oil into the bilges.

750
00:55:05,251 --> 00:55:07,617
Stand by to pump it overboard
when I give you the word.

751
00:55:07,687 --> 00:55:08,915
<i>Pump bilges?</i>

752
00:55:09,189 --> 00:55:11,987
<i>- You heard right, Mr. Adams.
- Aye, aye, sir.</i>

753
00:55:23,536 --> 00:55:26,403
- Rudder at midships.
- Rudder at midship, aye, sir.

754
00:55:27,774 --> 00:55:30,265
<i>- Rudder is midship, sir.
- Very well...</i>

755
00:55:31,378 --> 00:55:33,278
<i>Adams, pump the bilges.</i>

756
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,730
It's heading right for our periscope.

757
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:58,135
That's it. Keep coming at us, little man.

758
00:55:59,005 --> 00:56:03,203
Come on. Keep coming. Don't lose us.

759
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,880
Have Mr. Adams keep pouring out that oil.

760
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,416
- Tell him, keep pumping it out.
- Aye, aye, sir.

761
00:56:11,484 --> 00:56:13,816
<i>Mr. Adams, keep pumping bilges.</i>

762
00:56:13,887 --> 00:56:15,411
We're doing great, we are.

763
00:56:15,488 --> 00:56:17,217
Gushing oil like we owned all of Texas.

764
00:56:17,290 --> 00:56:20,487
What are you worrying about?
Maybe we'll wind up millionaires.

765
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:22,187
Yeah, rich, dead millionaires.

766
00:56:22,262 --> 00:56:24,162
<i>Make ready all tubes. Set depth eight feet.</i>

767
00:56:24,230 --> 00:56:26,528
<i>Stand by to fire a spread of three torpedoes.</i>

768
00:56:26,599 --> 00:56:28,624
What did I tell you, fellows?
Nothing to worry about.

769
00:56:28,701 --> 00:56:31,397
Okay, girls, stand by
on tubes. On the double.

770
00:56:39,345 --> 00:56:41,939
- Rig for depth charge attack.
- Aye, aye, sir.

771
00:56:42,048 --> 00:56:43,743
Rig for depth charge attack.

772
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,182
Down scope.

773
00:56:47,187 --> 00:56:49,087
- Right full rudder.
- Right full rudder.

774
00:56:49,155 --> 00:56:50,679
- Secure the bilge pumps.
- Aye, aye, sir.

775
00:56:50,757 --> 00:56:52,657
Secure the bilge pumps.

776
00:56:53,226 --> 00:56:54,625
Rudder is right full, sir.

777
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:03,594
Call the torpedo room,
fire false target shell.

778
00:57:04,104 --> 00:57:05,696
What's a false target shell?

779
00:57:05,772 --> 00:57:07,239
An explosion of bubbles.

780
00:57:07,307 --> 00:57:11,403
Sends out an echo to where he's pinging.
He'll pick it up and think it's us.

781
00:57:11,578 --> 00:57:12,806
We hope.

782
00:57:26,126 --> 00:57:28,424
Lowest creeping speed,
rig for silent running.

783
00:57:28,495 --> 00:57:29,587
Aye, aye, sir.

784

Answers up. All ahead full, sir.

790
00:58:39,832 --> 00:58:42,733
Any of you guys know how to pray, do it now.

00:59:37,890 --> 00:59:39,653
Very well. Up scope.

<i>Range mark, 300 yards.</i>

Steady as you go, Dalton. Steady as you go.

800
01:00:02,548 --> 01:00:04,482
Steady as she goes, sir.

Fire at any time, Captain.

802
01:00:13,092 --> 01:00:14,855
Thanks, Mr. Malone.

01:00:24,771 --> 01:00:26,068
Up scope.

Fire one.

806
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:52,389
Number one torpedo, fired electrically.

807
01:00:52,465 --> 01:00:53,454
<i>Fire two.</i>

All torpedoes running
hot, straight and normal.

813
01:01:08,514 --> 01:01:10,812
Eight seconds, seven seconds...

814
01:01:13,853 --> 01:01:16,117
Two seconds, one second, zero.

815
01:01:16,189 --> 01:01:18,157
First one should be there, Captain.

816
01:01:18,224 --> 01:01:21,455
Number one still running
hot, straight and normal.

817
01:01:21,527 --> 01:01:23,927
- Sound fading.
- We've missed.

01:01:24,030 --> 01:01:27,056
Three seconds, two seconds, one second, zero.

819
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:38,403

Right full rudder. All ahead flank.

01:01:45,418 --> 01:01:46,442
Right full rudder. All ahead flank.

822
01:01:46,519 --> 01:01:48,043
Sound, what do you hear?

823
01:01:48,121 --> 01:01:51,090
We're too close to make it out,
sir. Its screws have stopped.

824
01:01:51,157 --> 01:01:54,092
- Is he on top of us?
- No, sir, just abeam now.

825
01:01:54,160 --> 01:01:56,355
All ahead one third. Up scope.

All ahead one-third.

827
01:02:04,504 --> 01:02:06,631
- She's hit.
- Yeah!

828
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:10,370
That's right! I knew she'd change our luck.

829
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:29,454
Hey there, laughing boy, what do
you think about the skipper now, huh?

830
01:02:29,529 --> 01:02:33,363
You celebrate if you want to, I'm
not. We're still a long way from home.

831
01:02:33,433 --> 01:02:35,924
What are you worried about?
We got food, ain't we?

832
01:02:36,002 --> 01:02:37,765
We got lots of food.

833
01:02:56,322 --> 01:02:57,949
- Hi.
- Lieutenant.

834
01:03:13,606 --> 01:03:15,437
- Hi, Lieutenant.
- Hi.

835
01:03:16,075 --> 01:03:19,044
<i>What you got there,
Shelton, Milkman's Matinee?</i>

836
01:03:19,111 --> 01:03:22,603
Tokyo Rose. She kind of gets
you right here, doesn't she?

837
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,974
Yeah, she does.

838
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:28,115
Little Fox schedule coming in.

839
01:03:29,822 --> 01:03:32,313
"Promotions. All Navy.

840
01:03:34,327 --> 01:03:40,789
"All ensigns, 25,000 to 30,000 to JG."

841
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:50,534
Well, what do you know? 26.

842
01:03:50,610 --> 01:03:52,510
That ALNAV caught Mr. Malone.

843
01:03:52,912 --> 01:03:55,847
Now, that's one promotion
that I can approve of.

844
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,644
It's gonna be good news to Pat.

845
01:03:57,717 --> 01:04:00,584
Sure is. Now he's got nothing to worry about.

846
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:02,009
Yeah, well, I don't know.

847
01:04:03,256 --> 01:04:06,555
A few promotions in Pearl
he's a little worried about.

848
01:04:06,626 --> 01:04:07,752
What?

849
01:04:08,528 --> 01:04:10,257
Nothing. Forget it.

850
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:35,681
Lieutenant Malone.

851
01:04:36,656 --> 01:04:38,248
As you were, men.

852
01:04:39,992 --> 01:04:41,789
Take it easy, Willie.

853
01:04:45,665 --> 01:04:46,996
Attention.

854
01:04:47,567 --> 01:04:49,432
- Hey!
- Lieutenant Malone!

855
01:04:49,569 --> 01:04:51,230
Lieutenant Malone!

856
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:54,405
Thanks, Weary.

857
01:04:56,909 --> 01:04:58,672
Well, say something.

858
01:05:00,012 --> 01:05:02,480
Well, there's not much I can say,

859
01:05:02,582 --> 01:05:06,416
but I can tell you guys that I've
waited for this for a long time.

860
01:05:06,485 --> 01:05:08,976
You've made me feel good. Real good.

861
01:05:09,455 --> 01:05:10,513
Congratulations.

862
01:05:10,590 --> 01:05:12,888
Hey, Lieutenant. Come on. Cut the cake.

863
01:05:13,826 --> 01:05:16,556
Lieutenant, will you autograph this? I
wrote my girl in Mission all about you.

864
01:05:16,629 --> 01:05:18,790
- Yeah, sure. Here, give me that pen.
- Come on, Lieutenant.

865
01:05:18,864 --> 01:05:20,525
- When you gonna cut that cake?
- I'm happy.

866
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:22,898
I have an extra pair of bars,
Lieutenant. I wish you'd use them.

867
01:05:22,969 --> 01:05:24,596
Thanks, Lieutenant. Say,
can I talk to you a minute?

868
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:25,932
- Sure.
- When you gonna cut the cake?

869
01:05:26,005 --> 01:05:30,066
Look, you guys cut the cake, and I'll
be right with you. Save me a piece.

870
01:05:33,179 --> 01:05:37,741
Now that we're brother Lieutenants,
well, we share the same rank and all,

871
01:05:38,551 --> 01:05:40,985
we shouldn't have any secrets
from each other, should we?

872
01:05:41,053 --> 01:05:42,179
No.

873
01:05:43,122 --> 01:05:45,249
Well, you know what I mean.

874
01:05:45,625 --> 01:05:49,322
Well, remember what we were talking
about the day you came aboard?

875
01:05:49,428 --> 01:05:51,396
- Yeah.
- Well...

876
01:05:53,132 --> 01:05:57,330
Well, Lieutenant Malone, if I told
you the truth, you wouldn't believe it.

877
01:05:57,403 --> 01:05:59,030
Come on, test me.

878
01:06:04,276 --> 01:06:05,937
No.

879
01:06:45,383 --> 01:06:46,873
Escape hatch check out okay, Lieutenant?

880
01:06:46,951 --> 01:06:48,612
Yeah, it's fine, Chief.

881
01:06:52,723 --> 01:06:53,849
Lung?

882
01:06:55,993 --> 01:06:57,551
- Lung okay.
- Watch?

883
01:06:59,163 --> 01:07:00,323
Okay.

884
01:07:00,998 --> 01:07:02,226
Camera?

885
01:07:05,636 --> 01:07:07,001
Camera okay.

886
01:07:07,438 --> 01:07:08,871
Survival kit?

887
01:07:11,609 --> 01:07:13,304
Survival kit okay.

888
01:07:14,712 --> 01:07:17,306
- Rig for silent running.
- Aye, aye, sir.

889
01:07:18,249 --> 01:07:20,114
<i>Rig for silent running.</i>

890
01:07:20,885 --> 01:07:22,785
<i>Rig for silent running.</i>

891
01:07:31,829 --> 01:07:33,194
Down scope.

892
01:07:37,702 --> 01:07:40,671
- Sonar, what do you hear?
- Nothing, sir.

893
01:07:44,241 --> 01:07:46,971
- All ahead creeping speed.
- Aye, aye, sir.

894
01:07:47,044 --> 01:07:49,706
Maneuvering room, all ahead creeping speed.

895
01:07:49,780 --> 01:07:51,771
All ahead creeping speed.

896
01:07:56,487 --> 01:07:58,079
This is the Captain.

897
01:07:58,155 --> 01:08:00,487
There's been a change in plans.

898
01:08:00,958 --> 01:08:03,119
<i>We are now entering the lagoon.</i>

899
01:08:03,728 --> 01:08:05,491
So the ice is melted.

900
01:08:05,663 --> 01:08:06,755
What did you say?

901
01:08:06,831 --> 01:08:09,527
<i>There is an enemy ship directly above us.</i>

902
01:08:11,702 --> 01:08:12,964
I didn't say anything.

903
01:08:13,037 --> 01:08:15,528
<i>I want absolute silence in the boat.</i>

904
01:08:16,006 --> 01:08:17,837
Yeah, like a morgue.

905
01:08:23,948 --> 01:08:26,542
Reef 10 degrees on starboard bow, sir.

906
01:08:36,293 --> 01:08:37,760
Left standard rudder.

907
01:08:37,828 --> 01:08:39,887
Left standard rudder. Aye, aye, sir.

908
01:08:39,964 --> 01:08:42,933
- Steady as you go.
- Steady as she goes, sir.

909
01:08:51,942 --> 01:08:54,137
<i>Steady as you go, Dalton. Steady as you go.</i>

910
01:08:54,211 --> 01:08:56,111
<i>Steady as she goes, sir.</i>

911
01:09:25,576 --> 01:09:28,568
- Steady as you go.
- Steady as she goes, sir.

912
01:10:29,673 --> 01:10:32,005
- Rig in sound heads.
- Aye, aye, sir.

913
01:10:32,076 --> 01:10:34,067
Rig in the sound heads.

914
01:10:34,278 --> 01:10:36,906
All stop. Let her settle to the bottom.

915
01:10:37,047 --> 01:10:38,514
All stop, sir.

916
01:11:29,166 --> 01:11:31,293
- All checked out?
- Yes, sir.

917
01:11:32,536 --> 01:11:34,436
Take a walk for a minute, huh, Pat?

918
01:11:34,505 --> 01:11:35,972
Aye, aye, sir.

919
01:11:37,641 --> 01:11:39,871
You're in 500 yards offshore.

920
01:11:40,077 --> 01:11:41,567
Thank you, sir.

921
01:11:41,645 --> 01:11:43,738
Don't thank me, thank them.

922
01:11:44,114 --> 01:11:47,413
At 2000 yards you'd have to
surface to make that swim.

923
01:11:48,152 --> 01:11:51,713
If you surface in this light
with them there, they'd spot you.

924
01:11:51,855 --> 01:11:53,948
If they spot you, they get me.

925
01:11:54,024 --> 01:11:55,616
And the mission.

926
01:11:55,693 --> 01:11:57,285
And the mission.

927
01:11:57,561 --> 01:11:59,927
This way you go all the way underwater.

928
01:11:59,997 --> 01:12:01,589
No problem, sir.

929
01:12:01,699 --> 01:12:04,497
Get this through your head,
Lieutenant. Nothing's changed.

930
01:12:04,568 --> 01:12:06,331
There is a problem.

931
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:10,199
Today we've been running submerged.
Our oxygen supply is limited.

932
01:12:10,274 --> 01:12:12,742
Now, I could try to sneak out
the same way I came in here.

933
01:12:12,810 --> 01:12:15,108
I could surface, recharge, pump in fresh air,

934
01:12:15,179 --> 01:12:17,670
come back, and sit and wait for you.

935
01:12:17,748 --> 01:12:20,342
I do it the first time,
maybe I can get away with it.

936
01:12:20,417 --> 01:12:23,045
I do it twice, I could get clobbered.

937
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:26,487
- You know what I'm gonna do?
- No, sir.

938
01:12:27,524 --> 01:12:29,856
I'm gonna sit and wait for you.

939
01:12:30,494 --> 01:12:32,485
Not three days, not two,

940
01:12:32,730 --> 01:12:34,220
not even one.

941
01:12:35,032 --> 01:12:36,363
No RSVP?

942
01:12:36,734 --> 01:12:37,860
Oh, sure.

943
01:12:37,935 --> 01:12:42,395
You'll answer in 18 hours. We can't
breathe long on carbon dioxide.

944
01:12:47,077 --> 01:12:50,569
Eighteen hours? That's 10:00 tonight, sir.

945
01:12:50,881 --> 01:12:53,406
That's right. That's your deadline.

946
01:12:53,951 --> 01:12:58,217
If you're not back by
then, I go one way, out.

947
01:12:59,223 --> 01:13:01,885
And I don't come back. You understand?

948
01:13:03,627 --> 01:13:05,857
That couldn't be clearer, sir.

949
01:13:10,701 --> 01:13:12,328
- Braden.
- Yes, sir.

950
01:13:12,669 --> 01:13:14,569
I hope you make it.

951
01:13:15,939 --> 01:13:17,201
Thanks.

952
01:24:39,355 --> 01:24:41,323
<i>It isn't what you think.</i>

953
01:24:42,292 --> 01:24:44,283
<i>It isn't what you think.</i>

954
01:24:44,761 --> 01:24:46,729
<i>It isn't what you think.</i>

955
01:24:48,064 --> 01:24:50,589
If I told you that I loved you, too?

956
01:24:52,368 --> 01:24:54,859
That isn't saying you'll marry me.

957
01:25:18,595 --> 01:25:19,960
- Thank you.
- Good night.

958
01:25:46,256 --> 01:25:48,121
At your service, ma'am.

959
01:25:48,958 --> 01:25:50,289
Thank you.

960
01:25:55,598 --> 01:25:58,089
I'm sorry I got so female just now.

961
01:25:59,169 --> 01:26:01,899
Why do you think I asked you to marry me?

962
01:26:03,973 --> 01:26:05,338
Look, lady,

963
01:26:05,408 --> 01:26:08,502
you marry me and I'll
make it worth your while.

964
01:26:09,245 --> 01:26:10,644
Yes, I know.

965
01:26:12,148 --> 01:26:15,311
You don't give a girl a
chance to enjoy your proposal.

966
01:26:15,385 --> 01:26:17,615
That's because I'm not a girl.

967
01:26:18,688 --> 01:26:22,556
But don't you know that a girl
likes to dream about these things?

968
01:26:22,625 --> 01:26:27,062
Well, half the fun is to walk around
in a daze and imagine what it's like.

969
01:26:28,064 --> 01:26:29,827
Brag to her friends.

970
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,561
That's such a waste of time.

971
01:26:33,736 --> 01:26:35,727
- I got an idea.
- What?

972
01:26:37,273 --> 01:26:39,707
<i>Why don't we go on the
post and wake up the padre?</i>

973
01:26:39,776 --> 01:26:43,974
He's a real great guy and likes
nothing better than to marry people.

974
01:26:45,014 --> 01:26:46,242
No.

975
01:26:48,551 --> 01:26:49,984
No license.

976
01:26:52,222 --> 01:26:55,453
I got an even better one. We go to Tijuana.

977
01:26:56,793 --> 01:26:58,317
Well, what do you say?

978
01:27:00,029 --> 01:27:03,362
I would love nothing better, Ken. Honest.

979
01:27:05,668 --> 01:27:08,831
But please, do it my way.

980
01:27:08,905 --> 01:27:12,397
- Give it just a little more time.
- Sure. Till tomorrow.

981
01:27:13,276 --> 01:27:16,404
No, Ken. You don't understand.

982
01:27:17,580 --> 01:27:19,309
Yes, I understand.

983
01:27:20,516 --> 01:27:21,983
I can wait.

984
01:27:23,319 --> 01:27:27,153
It will make me nervous, but I can wait.

985
01:33:52,041 --> 01:33:53,338
How's the oxygen?

986
01:33:53,409 --> 01:33:55,809
Down to about 20 minutes, sir.

987
01:33:55,878 --> 01:33:58,073
Ash ran a test on the CO2.

988
01:33:58,147 --> 01:34:00,581
Nearly at the fatal mark, Captain.

989
01:41:01,336 --> 01:41:02,564
Hold it.

990
01:41:18,487 --> 01:41:20,785
Hey, I'm sorry, Peck.

991
01:41:23,392 --> 01:41:25,223
Yeah, Kovak, me, too.

992
01:41:26,829 --> 01:41:28,387
What happened?

993
01:42:45,007 --> 01:42:47,271
Tell the engine room to stand by.

994
01:42:47,342 --> 01:42:50,106
- Prepare to get under way.
- Aye, aye, sir.

995
01:42:50,579 --> 01:42:53,241
<i>Engine room, prepare to get under way.</i>

996
01:42:53,882 --> 01:42:55,873
<i>Prepare to get under way.</i>

997
01:46:16,918 --> 01:46:19,284
<i>- Captain to the conning tower.
- Yes, sir.</i>

998
01:46:19,421 --> 01:46:20,820
He's back.

999
01:46:20,889 --> 01:46:22,550
Let's get out of here, Mr. Doherty.

1000
01:46:22,624 --> 01:46:25,388
<i>- Pass the word to all hands.
- Aye, aye, sir.</i>

1001
01:46:25,861 --> 01:46:28,625
<i>Engine room, all ahead tripping speed.</i>

1002
01:46:28,697 --> 01:46:32,463
Please, Lieutenant, sir. Get
your wet clammy hands off of me.

1003
01:46:32,601 --> 01:46:35,195
- Did you get it?
- Yes, sir, I got it.

1004
01:46:36,271 --> 01:46:38,239
Thanks for waiting, sir.

1005
01:47:22,818 --> 01:47:25,480
Murphy, the yeoman's on the sick
list. You wanna take a letter for me?

1006
01:47:25,554 --> 01:47:26,851
Yes, sir.

1007
01:47:30,692 --> 01:47:33,320
From Commander Paul Stevenson of the US Navy

1008
01:47:33,795 --> 01:47:36,593
to Commander Submarine Force Pacific.

1009
01:47:37,165 --> 01:47:40,760
Subject: Articles for the
Government of the Navy,

1010
01:47:41,736 --> 01:47:43,203
violation of.

1011
01:47:45,707 --> 01:47:49,837
On the 17th of this month, in order
to accomplish assigned mission,

1012
01:47:50,479 --> 01:47:53,937
I entered Lele Lagoon,
submerged without proper charts,

1013
01:47:54,049 --> 01:47:58,952
and remained there in absolute silence
on the bottom for a period of 18 hours.

1014
01:47:59,054 --> 01:48:00,544
Paragraph two.

1015
01:48:01,923 --> 01:48:03,481
Thereafter,

1016
01:48:03,692 --> 01:48:07,423
in violation of my own
strict orders for silence,

1017
01:48:08,130 --> 01:48:13,158
I caused breaking of said silence
by sending out tapping signals

1018
01:48:13,235 --> 01:48:17,604
to guide Lieutenant JG Kenneth Braden

1019
01:48:19,207 --> 01:48:21,141
<i>back to the Barracuda.</i>

1020
01:48:22,377 --> 01:48:23,969
Paragraph three.

1021
01:48:25,680 --> 01:48:28,046
I am guilty, therefore,

1022
01:48:29,184 --> 01:48:32,881
of violation of Article 4, Section 10

1023
01:48:32,954 --> 01:48:34,888
of the subject AGN

1024
01:48:36,958 --> 01:48:40,826
in that I knowingly and improperly

1025
01:48:42,597 --> 01:48:45,498
hazarded the vessel under my command

1026
01:48:46,468 --> 01:48:49,437
and exposed the lives of the crew.

1027
01:48:50,138 --> 01:48:51,662
Paragraph four.

1028
01:48:52,874 --> 01:48:55,570
It is respectfully requested, therefore,

1029
01:48:56,645 --> 01:49:01,514
that a Board of Investigation
be convened to inquire

1030
01:49:02,350 --> 01:49:06,650
into my conduct during the present mission.

1031
01:49:07,155 --> 01:49:08,349
Signed.

1032
01:49:08,857 --> 01:49:11,189
Type that out for me, right away.

1033
01:49:52,601 --> 01:49:56,264
If you're looking for the
letter you wrote, sir, it's lost.

1034
01:49:57,906 --> 01:49:58,998
Lost?

1035
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:01,599
Yes, sir. The...

1036
01:50:02,077 --> 01:50:03,738
Well, the crew...

1037
01:50:05,313 --> 01:50:07,110
Well, sir, it's lost.

1038
01:50:33,708 --> 01:50:35,073
Expendable.

1039
01:51:15,684 --> 01:51:16,673
English
