1
00:02:14,184 --> 00:02:19,144
When we locked this file back in 1945,
I hoped we'd never open it again.

2
00:02:24,594 --> 00:02:27,563
Can't we mark it "Rest in Peace"?

3
00:02:27,764 --> 00:02:33,225
Not as long as scientists try to prove
porpoises have brains rivaling man's.

4
00:02:33,436 --> 00:02:36,837
Tests are proving
these sea creatures possess...

5
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,340
...such amaing faculties
that they seem almost human.

6
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:43,705
Even superhuman.

7
00:02:44,347 --> 00:02:48,215
And they think that he might
be teaching them?

8
00:02:49,152 --> 00:02:52,178
- That's right, lieutenant.
- But admiral...

9
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:55,590
Do you think we can find him
after so long?

10
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:58,283
That's our assignment, to find him.

11
00:02:58,494 --> 00:03:03,898
And to try to get him to coordinate
his work with our scientists.

12
00:03:21,584 --> 00:03:25,918
"September, 1941."
That's when it first started.

13
00:03:27,991 --> 00:03:30,459
Yeah, that's when it started.

14
00:03:35,331 --> 00:03:39,563
I never knew him,
you know, until after...

15
00:03:45,008 --> 00:03:47,772
- Is that a good likeness?
- Perfect.

16
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:52,381
Yes. At least that's the way
he looked before...

17
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,507
Well, you know...

18
00:03:55,685 --> 00:03:58,620
How he was when...

19
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:04,487
In September '41 before...

20
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:10,898
And this...

21
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:14,195
...taken by one of our divers.

22
00:04:17,674 --> 00:04:20,199
Is there any doubt in your mind?

23
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,004
No, that's him.

24
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:29,844
Just when I almost managed
to forget...

25
00:04:30,053 --> 00:04:35,013
...it all comes back like a nightmare.

26
00:04:38,628 --> 00:04:42,291
- Skipper!
- We have no choice, lieutenant.

27
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:47,663
Orders from the very top.
They're recalling him to active duty.

28
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:51,699
And we must stay with it until
we complete our mission:

29
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,364
To find...

30
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:56,739
...Henry Limpet.

31
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:01,976
I don't know. Henry always lived
in a world of his own.

32
00:05:02,185 --> 00:05:07,213
I remember way back when he was
working as a bookkeeper in Brooklyn.

33
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,750
There you are, Mr. Limpet.

34
00:06:14,357 --> 00:06:16,052
Thank you, Miss Barnes.

35
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,922
I know what it is to be
without your glasses.

36
00:06:21,197 --> 00:06:25,065
Well, did you have your physical
this morning?

37
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:29,398
I suppose we'll be losing you
to the Navy soon, then?

38
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:32,299
- I'm afraid not.
- Really?

39
00:06:32,508 --> 00:06:38,640
No, my eyesight. And a few other
things. I'm classified 4-F.

40
00:06:38,848 --> 00:06:44,013
Everybody can't be a hero, Mr. Limpet.
We need men like you at home too.

41
00:06:45,054 --> 00:06:49,923
- Why?
- To give to the blood bank, of course.

42
00:06:50,126 --> 00:06:52,026
They don't want my blood.

43
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:58,528
- There's always your job at the office.
- Miss Barnes, my job isn't important.

44
00:06:58,935 --> 00:07:01,563
They could hire anybody to replace me.

45
00:07:01,771 --> 00:07:06,231
I'm sure your wife will be happy
to know you'll never be called.

46
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:11,346
Well, I hope so.
But Bessie's very patriotic.

47
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:15,779
And very healthy. They may take her.

48
00:07:22,058 --> 00:07:24,652
- Henry Limpet.
- Henry?

49
00:07:24,861 --> 00:07:28,194
- Hello, Bessie.
- Henry, George is here...

50
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:31,298
- George Stickle?
- Yes. Now, Henry...

51
00:07:31,467 --> 00:07:34,436
- He's back on liberty?
- Yes, he is.

52
00:07:34,604 --> 00:07:37,767
- That's nice.
- Did you go to the draft board?

53
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:41,774
- Yes, I did, Bessie. They rejected me.
- Rejected? Again?

54
00:07:42,578 --> 00:07:46,207
Let's not say too much
about this in front of George.

55
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:52,785
You come straight home from work.
Don't hang around that pet shop.

56
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:57,723
Don't be upset, Miss Barnes.

57
00:07:57,927 --> 00:08:00,953
There's a fish in the water cooler.

58
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,721
I know. It's mine.

59
00:08:13,543 --> 00:08:15,568
Hi there.

60
00:09:24,547 --> 00:09:27,141
Hi, Hen old boy!

61
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:32,515
- George, good to see you.
- Good to see you, little buddy.

62
00:09:32,722 --> 00:09:38,456
Don't you look important? That uniform
and all those doodads on your sleeve.

63
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,892
- Just a couple of hash marks.
- Don't apologie.

64
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:47,263
For your information, Henry, I am now
a machinist's mate second class.

65
00:09:47,470 --> 00:09:52,237
Machinist's mate second class.
You look first-class to me, George.

66
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:55,774
What kind of a machine
are you mated to?

67
00:09:56,712 --> 00:09:59,510
That's a little bit of humor.

68
00:10:00,449 --> 00:10:04,283
Hey, Bess! Time to take over.
Lover-boy's here.

69
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:07,754
- Hello, dear.
- Hello, Henry.

70
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:17,526
Control yourself, Henry.
We have a guest.

71
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,433
- I'm sorry, George.
- I forgive you, Casanova.

72
00:10:21,637 --> 00:10:22,899
Isn't it wonderful?

73
00:10:23,105 --> 00:10:28,008
George has liberty the whole weekend,
and he wants to spend it with us.

74
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:32,943
The whole weekend?
Oh, well, that's great.

75
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:38,586
Well, little buddy,
I hear you missed the boat, huh?

76
00:10:39,522 --> 00:10:44,016
The boat? No, I missed
the subway train, but l...

77
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:48,526
No, no, Hanky pal,
down at the draft board.

78
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,790
Washed out completely, I hear.

79
00:10:51,434 --> 00:10:56,997
Oh, that. You can't
win them all, George.

80
00:10:58,641 --> 00:10:59,630
Bessie?

81
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,503
Yes, George. What is it?

82
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:06,010
What say we clear the decks
for action, go dancing?

83
00:11:06,215 --> 00:11:10,174
- Feel like shaking a leg, Henry?
- No thanks, George.

84
00:11:10,353 --> 00:11:14,153
I can't. I have faulty equilibrium
due to poor vision.

85
00:11:14,357 --> 00:11:18,885
How many times must I tell you,
you do not rumba with your eyes!

86
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:24,123
Now, don't worry.
We'll think of something exciting.

87
00:11:24,333 --> 00:11:26,995
Say, listen, I have an idea.

88
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:32,573
Why don't we go to the university
for Professor Hoffmeyer's lecture?

89
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:37,503
- Lecture?
- On decapods of the genera Pagurus.

90
00:11:37,713 --> 00:11:43,674
You know, he's gonna talk about
the mating habits of the shellfish.

91
00:11:43,886 --> 00:11:49,256
It's a little risqué.
Sort of for adults only, you know.

92
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:54,419
I'll just pass on that action.
I've got a weak heart.

93
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,802
I've got it! Why don't we run out
to Coney Island tomorrow morning?

94
00:12:01,003 --> 00:12:03,369
- Well, I don't know...
- Henry!

95
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:09,267
You do not have to eat clam chowder
because it's Coney Island! We'll go!

96
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:13,471
I hate to miss that lecture,
but I do like the water.

97
00:12:14,216 --> 00:12:15,308
Water and fish.

98
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:20,455
If you paid half as much attention
to me as those fish, I'd be happy!

99
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:26,856
It's just that fish are so bright
and cheerful. And so beautiful.

100
00:12:28,597 --> 00:12:34,900
Look at him. Always drawing into his
shell, going off into his fish world!

101
00:12:36,272 --> 00:12:40,572
Say, old boy, if you just stand
there staring down...

102
00:12:40,743 --> 00:12:46,181
...at that cup of sardines,
you're liable to go off your nut.

103
00:12:50,886 --> 00:12:53,081
George, come here.

104
00:12:58,294 --> 00:13:01,661
Have you given much thought
to the Devonian Period?

105
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:05,800
- The what?
- Devonian Period of the Paleooic Era.

106
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:11,064
You know, it followed the Silurian
and preceded the Carboniferous Eras.

107
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:17,073
- I try not to think of things like that.
- I've given it a lot of thought.

108
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:19,580
A lot of thought.

109
00:13:19,782 --> 00:13:22,808
Do you realie our ancestors
were fish?

110
00:13:23,018 --> 00:13:27,580
Maybe your ancestors, Henry, not mine.

111
00:13:30,726 --> 00:13:36,096
Maybe you ought to try to find a new
hobby. Maybe go in for parakeets.

112
00:13:36,298 --> 00:13:40,826
- I'm not joking. I can explain.
- He sure can.

113
00:13:41,036 --> 00:13:43,698
He's read many books on the subject.

114
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:47,865
He claims years ago there
was nothing but fish in the world.

115
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:52,207
That's right. Then some of those
creatures became amphibians...

116
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:57,613
...they crawled out on land. Millions
of years later they became men.

117
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:04,188
- I know some who ought to crawl back.
- Doesn't it give you a thrill of hope?

118
00:14:04,393 --> 00:14:06,054
Hope for what, Henry?

119
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:10,494
With the war in Europe
and new weapons being invented...

120
00:14:10,699 --> 00:14:14,692
...what if men were foolish enough
to destroy themselves?

121
00:14:14,904 --> 00:14:18,635
Then the fish would develop
into a new race of men...

122
00:14:18,807 --> 00:14:21,298
...and this time they might
turn out better.

123
00:14:21,844 --> 00:14:25,439
How would you like a cocktail, George?

124
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:28,272
Fine, fine.

125
00:14:28,851 --> 00:14:31,081
Excuse me.

126
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,120
I wish I were a fish.

127
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:42,487
Fish have a better life than people.

128
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:36,574
Henry! The water!

129
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:38,116
What a mess!

130
00:15:42,891 --> 00:15:48,625
- Just look at my rug!
- I've got it stopped now, Bessie.

131
00:15:48,831 --> 00:15:53,097
You are floating yourself
out of your home with this hobby!

132
00:15:53,302 --> 00:15:58,399
I'm gonna run down to the store and
get a regulator for the intake hose.

133
00:15:58,607 --> 00:16:03,510
Take all of this junk with you!
The fish, tank, bowl, the whole works!

134
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:07,978
- You mean get rid of them?!
- You bet I do! Everything out!

135
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:13,086
- But Bessie!
- Either those fish go or I do!

136
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:17,122
Which is it to be?

137
00:16:55,364 --> 00:16:59,391
I keep remembering how hurt
they looked when I left them.

138
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:06,667
- Who looked hurt?
- My fish. When I left them at the shop.

139
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:09,867
For heaven's sake, forget that.

140
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,640
We're out to enjoy ourselves.
For once.

141
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:17,683
Say, did I tell you about
my patrol duty near Bermuda?

142
00:17:17,886 --> 00:17:23,153
- You wrote us all about that.
- I left out the most exciting details.

143
00:17:23,358 --> 00:17:27,454
See, I don't like to brag
but, I tell you, that one morning...

144
00:17:27,663 --> 00:17:33,101
- It was at night, wasn't it?
- Right. Good memory.

145
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:36,169
We went out with me
in the engine room...

146
00:17:36,371 --> 00:17:40,068
I thought you were on the bridge
with the admiral?

147
00:17:40,275 --> 00:17:43,608
Was it you or George
who made that voyage?

148
00:17:44,012 --> 00:17:45,536
I'm sorry, George.

149
00:17:45,714 --> 00:17:48,877
There are things you don't mention
in the open.

150
00:17:49,084 --> 00:17:53,418
We're not in the war. Why can't
you tell us about your destroyer?

151
00:17:53,622 --> 00:17:57,058
The USS Elias J. Starbright,
isn't it?

152
00:17:57,259 --> 00:17:59,727
Keep it down about my ship,
will you?

153
00:17:59,928 --> 00:18:04,262
There's things you don't understand,
not being in the service.

154
00:18:04,466 --> 00:18:08,197
- I tried.
- I can tell you this, though.

155
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:13,864
There are so many Nai subs below
the surface you could walk to Europe.

156
00:18:15,144 --> 00:18:20,707
The ocean's jumping with U-boats ready
to go if Uncle Sam gets in the fight.

157
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:26,554
I don't want to start a panic, so you
keep all this under your hat, right?

158
00:18:26,755 --> 00:18:28,484
Right, Bessie?

159
00:18:52,681 --> 00:18:56,617
Old boy, did I ever tell you
about the Caribbean?

160
00:18:56,819 --> 00:19:00,255
What a liberty we had
in a port near Trinidad!

161
00:19:00,455 --> 00:19:04,357
And Miami. Wow.

162
00:19:04,593 --> 00:19:09,997
- Did you ever do the rumba, Henry?
- Huh? No, I have faulty equilibrium.

163
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:14,135
Yes, sir. Join the Navy
and have a whirl!

164
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:18,466
Barbados, Kingston,
the Virgin Islands!

165
00:19:29,785 --> 00:19:32,117
Lunch is almost ready.

166
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:55,103
It must be wonderful
down there in your world.

167
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:58,442
Not a 4-F in the bunch.

168
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,544
Come along, Henry!

169
00:20:13,395 --> 00:20:16,796
I don't wanna wait a million years
to go back again.

170
00:20:17,499 --> 00:20:22,732
More than anything, I wish
I could be one of you right now.

171
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:25,504
I wish...

172
00:20:25,674 --> 00:20:28,438
I wish I were a fish.

173
00:20:54,069 --> 00:20:58,438
Henry! George, Henry can't swim.
Save him!

174
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,904
What will we do?

175
00:21:01,109 --> 00:21:02,940
Save him!

176
00:21:03,145 --> 00:21:07,104
Get some help! Call the lifeguards!
Get the police!

177
00:21:07,582 --> 00:21:11,279
Police! Lifeguard! Help!

178
00:21:31,106 --> 00:21:33,199
You all right, son?

179
00:21:56,264 --> 00:21:59,791
Come on. All right, move out.
It's all over.

180
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:03,631
Sorry, Bessie. I'll try again.

181
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:17,281
He doesn't even know how to swim.

182
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,615
And Bessie thought I couldn't swim.

183
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:28,489
He doesn't know how to swim!

184
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:54,985
Keep it clear here!

185
00:22:59,227 --> 00:23:00,854
Let me help you, son.

186
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,233
Bessie! What's gonna happen
to poor Bessie?

187
00:23:09,004 --> 00:23:14,567
- Did you see any sign of him at all?
- Afraid he's gone.

188
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:20,109
Guess he must have lost his glasses
during the fall.

189
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:24,513
- I saw a fish wearing them.
- Fish?

190
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:32,584
- Oh, no. Oh, George!
- Now, now.

191
00:23:32,794 --> 00:23:37,254
There Bessie, we'd better
get going home now.

192
00:23:37,466 --> 00:23:41,493
There we go.

193
00:23:41,703 --> 00:23:46,970
All right, folks, back up, please.
Let us through.

194
00:24:08,797 --> 00:24:12,563
And I thought it all
would be so beautiful.

195
00:24:13,001 --> 00:24:15,526
Wish I were home with Bessie.

196
00:24:50,272 --> 00:24:52,968
What am I gonna do now?

197
00:24:54,176 --> 00:24:56,576
Bessie won't like it at all.

198
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,805
I've never stayed out
all night before.

199
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,976
Maybe I should have
listened to Bessie.

200
00:25:26,474 --> 00:25:29,238
I got this back from the pet shop.

201
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:32,346
It didn't seem right leaving it,
with Henry...

202
00:25:33,415 --> 00:25:35,940
Well, he was so cray about it.

203
00:25:36,351 --> 00:25:40,082
Don't you think it would
make a nice planter?

204
00:25:40,889 --> 00:25:46,350
Sure. And you could fix it up
with dried seaweed and stuff.

205
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:52,727
- Make sort of a memorial for old Hen.
- That's sweet.

206
00:25:57,505 --> 00:26:03,375
- And I think he would appreciate that.
- Here's the notice:

207
00:26:03,578 --> 00:26:09,710
"Henry Limpet, a bookkeeper, residing
at 1313 Pleasant Avenue, Flatbush...

208
00:26:09,918 --> 00:26:15,117
...fell or jumped from a pier at Coney
Island. The body was not recovered.

209
00:26:15,323 --> 00:26:19,157
Limpet is survived by his widow,
Bessie Limpet."

210
00:26:19,361 --> 00:26:21,454
Poor Henry.

211
00:26:34,442 --> 00:26:36,103
Hi!

212
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:45,780
Gee, I must be nearing Florida.
Parrotfish live in southern waters.

213
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:51,390
Hi! I'm Henry Limpet. I'm...

214
00:27:46,915 --> 00:27:52,478
Jumping St. Elmo's fire! Who in blue
blaes invited you in here?

215
00:27:55,724 --> 00:27:59,387
- What is it?
- Slamming into my private quarters.

216
00:27:59,594 --> 00:28:03,997
Come about and stand by for action,
you four-eyed flounder!

217
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:07,527
Say, you're talking to me.

218
00:28:07,702 --> 00:28:10,398
You bet your binnacle
I'm talking to you!

219
00:28:10,572 --> 00:28:12,699
Now, hoist your tail and get!

220
00:28:12,974 --> 00:28:17,070
Why, you're a splendid specimen
of a Pagurus pollicaris.

221
00:28:17,245 --> 00:28:21,011
In common terminology,
you're a crustacean, a hermit crab.

222
00:28:21,182 --> 00:28:26,745
- I'm glad to meet you, Crusty.
- Crusty! That does it!

223
00:28:26,921 --> 00:28:32,188
Put up your fins! I'm gonna swab
the ocean floor with you.

224
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,193
Hey! Take it easy.
I don't wanna fight!

225
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:40,423
Let that be a lesson to you,
you confounded, four-eyed...

226
00:28:40,602 --> 00:28:43,196
Say, what are you, anyway?

227
00:28:43,371 --> 00:28:46,033
You related to the porpoise family?

228
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:51,668
No, I'm a Limpet. Henry Limpet from
Brooklyn. You know, Flatbush.

229
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:57,515
I've seen flat fish, but I've never
seen no four-eyed flat bush.

230
00:28:57,685 --> 00:28:58,982
Well, you see, l...

231
00:28:59,187 --> 00:29:03,385
Well, I'm not really a fish,
I'm a man.

232
00:29:03,558 --> 00:29:06,493
Or I was a man until quite recently.

233
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:12,429
Listen, Flatbush, anything I hate,
it's a smart-aleck fish.

234
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,661
I didn't mean to barge in on you,
but a shark was chasing me.

235
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,636
Shark! Jumping jellyfish!

236
00:29:19,808 --> 00:29:25,769
Just swing about and let that shark
chase you full speed away from here!

237
00:29:41,963 --> 00:29:44,932
Golly! Did that come out of me?

238
00:29:45,333 --> 00:29:49,360
Hurricane! Typhoon!
Stand by for a blow!

239
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,596
There's no hurricane.

240
00:29:51,906 --> 00:29:53,305
It was just me.

241
00:29:53,641 --> 00:29:58,476
Just you? You mean to say
that blast came out of you?

242
00:30:01,015 --> 00:30:04,382
Why, you loudmouth
son of a bellerin' barracuda!

243
00:30:04,552 --> 00:30:08,386
That belch of yours could capsie
me in the backwash.

244
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:11,616
If you sound off like that again,
I swear...

245
00:30:11,793 --> 00:30:15,160
...I'll batten your gills
and lower the boom on you.

246
00:30:15,330 --> 00:30:17,491
And furthermore...

247
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:35,479
Crusty?

248
00:30:35,683 --> 00:30:38,880
Crusty? You all right, Crusty?

249
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:44,956
Gotta hand it to you.

250
00:30:45,126 --> 00:30:48,653
That whale-busting noise of yours
is really something.

251
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:54,166
That blob of shrimp bait'll think
twice before he fools with us again.

252
00:30:54,569 --> 00:30:56,935
Well, guess I'll be off.

253
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:59,505
Off? Where are you going?

254
00:30:59,674 --> 00:31:03,075
I'd like to see if I can
locate others of my kind.

255
00:31:03,745 --> 00:31:07,704
I figure I'd better go along
to keep you out of trouble.

256
00:31:08,016 --> 00:31:11,383
Hey, great! Climb aboard, Crusty.

257
00:31:11,553 --> 00:31:16,252
I'll bet I'm gonna be busier
than a one-armed octopus with hives.

258
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:17,753
We're off!

259
00:31:17,926 --> 00:31:20,952
All right, Flatbush, let her rip.

260
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:36,610
Look! A freighter!

261
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:39,872
Hey, let's not get too close
to the critter.

262
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:42,374
Don't worry, it's not alive.

263
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,644
Not alive? Suffering swordfish!

264
00:31:45,820 --> 00:31:49,347
What kind of sea monster
killed a whopper like that?

265
00:31:49,524 --> 00:31:50,855
A torpedo did it.

266
00:31:51,025 --> 00:31:53,323
A torpedo?

267
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:57,590
Full speed away before
that blasted torpedo comes back.

268
00:31:57,765 --> 00:32:01,394
Oh, they won't attack us,
they're just after ships.

269
00:32:07,342 --> 00:32:12,541
Hey, don't go moseying around
in this thing's innards.

270
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:20,353
No wonder this thing died!
Look at the kind of stuff it ate.

271
00:32:41,075 --> 00:32:44,067
Here's the captain's logbook.

272
00:32:44,245 --> 00:32:46,475
Hey, listen to what it says.

273
00:32:46,681 --> 00:32:50,913
This ship was carrying
important cargo for the Allies.

274
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:54,919
Listen to what it says?
I didn't hear it say anything.

275
00:32:55,423 --> 00:32:58,586
There must be a way to stop
the Nai submarines.

276
00:32:58,926 --> 00:33:00,587
If only I could help.

277
00:33:00,862 --> 00:33:06,425
Quit mumbling to yourself, Flatbush.
Come on, let's shove off.

278
00:33:12,707 --> 00:33:15,608
This must be the captain's cabin.

279
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:26,987
Crusty, there's another fish in here!
A vicious-Iooking brute!

280
00:33:27,155 --> 00:33:33,116
Ugliest critter I've ever seen.
Gangway, get me out of here!

281
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:44,161
It's only a mirror. It's me.

282
00:33:44,706 --> 00:33:48,005
That's what I look like.

283
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:53,406
Well, swab my scuppers.
Another Flatbush.

284
00:33:53,581 --> 00:33:57,017
I'm not a bad-Iooking fish at that.

285
00:33:57,185 --> 00:34:00,746
Really, a pretty unique specimen.

286
00:34:01,489 --> 00:34:05,482
You've got some good points,
but beauty ain't one of them.

287
00:34:06,994 --> 00:34:10,054
Look at that strong gill structure.

288
00:34:10,498 --> 00:34:13,558
Did you ever see
such a fine dorsal formation?

289
00:34:13,735 --> 00:34:15,862
But maybe I'm a freak!

290
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:20,905
Am I gonna be like this
for just a little while or always?

291
00:34:21,075 --> 00:34:24,067
I'm probably the only one of my kind.

292
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:28,614
If only there was another
fish like me. Even just one.

293
00:34:28,783 --> 00:34:31,718
Someone who would understand me.

294
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:44,927
- Listen. Don't you hear that sound?
- What sound?

295
00:34:45,099 --> 00:34:48,193
I better go up topside
and have a look.

296
00:34:58,379 --> 00:34:59,505
How awful!

297
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:11,724
Did you see that?
They're trained to save each other!

298
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:25,868
Are you all right?

299
00:35:27,408 --> 00:35:31,071
Oh, yes. Thank you.

300
00:35:31,245 --> 00:35:33,509
Well, gosh...

301
00:35:34,649 --> 00:35:38,608
That was nothing at all.
I mean, nothing.

302
00:35:38,786 --> 00:35:41,983
Oh, yes, it was.
It was very nice of you.

303
00:35:42,156 --> 00:35:44,488
And very clever.

304
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,120
It was just a simple thing, really.
I mean, anyone could have done it.

305
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:53,494
Well, I think you're wonderful.

306
00:35:56,204 --> 00:36:00,038
Say, does that mean that you...

307
00:36:00,208 --> 00:36:03,405
...like me?
- Oh, yes, I like you very...

308
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:07,036
...very much.
- Is that right?

309
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:11,151
Well, golly, I mean...

310
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:14,510
- What's your name?
- Name?

311
00:36:15,356 --> 00:36:18,325
- I don't know what you mean.
- What people...

312
00:36:18,492 --> 00:36:23,156
- I mean, what fish call you by.
- I've never heard of such a thing.

313
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:26,426
Well, let's see.

314
00:36:26,601 --> 00:36:29,593
I'll call you Ladyfish.

315
00:36:30,238 --> 00:36:31,865
Do you like that?

316
00:36:32,039 --> 00:36:35,202
Yeah, Ladyfish!

317
00:36:35,376 --> 00:36:39,335
By the way, my name is Limpet.
Henry...

318
00:36:42,683 --> 00:36:44,708
Limpet.

319
00:36:46,988 --> 00:36:51,357
- All right, Limpet, shall we go?
- Go? Go where?

320
00:36:51,525 --> 00:36:56,121
Why, to the spawning grounds.
After what you did for me, l...

321
00:36:56,697 --> 00:37:01,327
Now, wait!
You don't know what you're saying.

322
00:37:01,502 --> 00:37:03,663
Oh, but I do.

323
00:37:04,805 --> 00:37:06,830
All I can say is:

324
00:37:07,008 --> 00:37:09,909
Mush and bilge water!

325
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:18,742
Well? Do you like it?

326
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,854
Wow!

327
00:37:21,188 --> 00:37:24,351
Bessie, you're a knockout!

328
00:37:28,796 --> 00:37:34,063
Know what that dress reminds me of?
The first time I saw you. Remember?

329
00:37:34,235 --> 00:37:36,533
Your pop brought me for dinner.

330
00:37:36,704 --> 00:37:42,506
Oh, George, imagine your remembering
after all these years.

331
00:37:42,677 --> 00:37:47,011
Thank you.
That was even before Henry...

332
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:52,549
Limpet, what is that on your nose?

333
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,847
On my nose?

334
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:58,887
Those are my eyeglasses.

335
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:04,623
- You see, I have a little astigmatism.
- Tigma-tism.

336
00:38:05,132 --> 00:38:08,295
Astigmatisms must be very nice.

337
00:38:08,469 --> 00:38:14,305
They make you look so distinguished.

338
00:38:14,942 --> 00:38:18,742
Well, they help me to see
a long way off.

339
00:38:20,848 --> 00:38:23,408
Do you see that barracuda
coming at us?

340
00:38:24,752 --> 00:38:28,586
Oh, Limpet, Limpet, we'll be killed!

341
00:38:28,956 --> 00:38:30,548
Just watch this!

342
00:38:37,598 --> 00:38:40,032
You're very wonderful.

343
00:38:40,201 --> 00:38:42,635
Shall we go?

344
00:40:45,326 --> 00:40:47,351
Ladyfish...?

345
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:49,928
You see, you don't understand.

346
00:40:50,131 --> 00:40:52,565
See, I have to tell you that...

347
00:40:52,733 --> 00:40:54,496
Well, I'm married.

348
00:40:54,668 --> 00:40:57,136
Married? What is that?

349
00:40:57,304 --> 00:41:00,068
Well, I have a wife.

350
00:41:01,342 --> 00:41:03,071
Is that like astigmatism?

351
00:41:03,277 --> 00:41:07,077
Oh, no, I mean, I already have
another lady fish.

352
00:41:07,248 --> 00:41:10,342
Oh, that! Shall we go?

353
00:41:10,518 --> 00:41:15,080
- It doesn't make a difference to you?
- I don't see why it should.

354
00:41:15,456 --> 00:41:18,016
Well, it's just not done.

355
00:41:18,192 --> 00:41:23,494
Do you spawn with every Tom,
Dick and fish that comes along?

356
00:41:23,697 --> 00:41:28,566
Oh, no. You see, up until now
I've been too young.

357
00:41:28,769 --> 00:41:30,862
Yes, of course. I understand.

358
00:41:31,038 --> 00:41:32,869
Now shall we go?

359
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:36,237
Now, look, Ladyfish, l...

360
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:39,106
I'd sure like...
Well, that is to say...

361
00:41:40,181 --> 00:41:43,344
Do you suppose that
we could just be...

362
00:41:43,517 --> 00:41:46,452
...well, more or less friends?

363
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:48,517
Friends?

364
00:41:48,689 --> 00:41:53,217
Wouldn't that be more or less
nothing, Limpet?

365
00:41:55,462 --> 00:41:57,828
Goodbye.

366
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,729
Goodbye.

367
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:03,259
But...
I mean, it wouldn't be proper.

368
00:42:03,437 --> 00:42:07,339
Gosh, I can't.

369
00:42:18,185 --> 00:42:21,814
But, Ladyfish! I didn't mean it!

370
00:42:35,769 --> 00:42:37,396
Ladyfish!

371
00:42:39,073 --> 00:42:40,700
Ladyfish!

372
00:42:41,508 --> 00:42:45,171
Oh, Ladyfish!

373
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:51,175
Oh, Ladyfish!

374
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:51,106
It's no use. I've searched everywhere.

375
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:08,619
Sunday, December 7, 1941.

376
00:44:08,796 --> 00:44:13,426
The nation was stunned
to hear the news this morning...

377
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:17,468
...of the unprovoked attack
that has led to a state of war.

378
00:44:18,806 --> 00:44:20,774
The rest is a mere formality.

379
00:44:20,941 --> 00:44:23,933
Sources say the president
will ask Congress...

380
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:28,176
Our country at war?

381
00:44:32,419 --> 00:44:34,216
Technically...

382
00:44:34,388 --> 00:44:36,720
...I'm not 4-F anymore.

383
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:42,487
I know, I'll go back to Brooklyn,
I'll find George Stickle and I'II...

384
00:44:42,663 --> 00:44:45,097
...I'll do something!

385
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:57,342
What's all this blabberdash about war
and 4-F, and Stickle and like that?

386
00:44:57,511 --> 00:45:01,675
Look, Flatbush, if you're in trouble,
you can count on me.

387
00:45:02,015 --> 00:45:06,145
If you'd stay here and look out
for Ladyfish, I'd be grateful.

388
00:45:06,353 --> 00:45:08,480
Not me, I'm going with you!

389
00:45:08,856 --> 00:45:11,188
Oh, please, it's important, Crusty.

390
00:45:11,358 --> 00:45:14,191
Tell her I love her
and I'll be back soon.

391
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:18,029
Well, all right. If you don't need me.

392
00:45:18,198 --> 00:45:21,031
Oh, I need you more
than ever, old fellow.

393
00:45:21,201 --> 00:45:23,863
To look after her while I'm gone.

394
00:45:24,271 --> 00:45:27,206
Flatbush, take it easy, huh?

395
00:45:27,374 --> 00:45:29,308
I will, Crusty.

396
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,535
Thanks.

397
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:35,373
So long, Flatbush!

398
00:46:03,944 --> 00:46:06,674
They're missing the U-boat!

399
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:17,487
Ahoy there!

400
00:46:18,158 --> 00:46:20,092
Ship ahoy!

401
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:23,295
Ahoy! Ship ahoy!

402
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:26,522
- Who's out there?
- A friend.

403
00:46:27,067 --> 00:46:28,967
Ahoy there!

404
00:46:29,136 --> 00:46:30,569
Ship ahoy!

405
00:46:31,138 --> 00:46:34,801
Don't be alarmed. Please don't!

406
00:46:36,376 --> 00:46:38,105
Are you on a raft?

407
00:46:38,312 --> 00:46:42,009
No, I'm swimming. I'm a fish!

408
00:46:44,351 --> 00:46:47,252
Good lord, a comedian!

409
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,783
Ahoy there!

410
00:46:58,565 --> 00:47:02,467
- What are you doing?
- We've got an unidentified contact.

411
00:47:02,636 --> 00:47:06,732
Why didn't you identify it?
There's a war going on!

412
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,898
Give the recognition signal!

413
00:47:09,109 --> 00:47:12,203
- I can't!
- Give the recognition signal!

414
00:47:12,379 --> 00:47:17,339
I'm Henry Limpet.
I fell in the ocean and was drowned.

415
00:47:17,518 --> 00:47:19,713
Only I wasn't drowned, exactly.

416
00:47:19,887 --> 00:47:23,220
- Hit him with the light.
- Hit him with the light!

417
00:47:23,390 --> 00:47:26,018
Give the recognition signal!

418
00:47:28,328 --> 00:47:31,456
- Commence firing!
- Commence firing!

419
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,834
Activate sonar dome.

420
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:55,820
Must be the ship's underwater
listening device.

421
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,357
Now hear this!

422
00:48:03,564 --> 00:48:08,126
This is Henry Limpet speaking.
This is Henry Limpet.

423
00:48:08,302 --> 00:48:10,668
You missed the sub.

424
00:48:11,071 --> 00:48:15,132
All engines ahead full.
Left standard rudder.

425
00:48:15,375 --> 00:48:19,778
The old man should hear this.
Pipe it to the bridge!

426
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:23,408
All engines ahead full.
Left standard rudder.

427
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:27,120
All engines ahead full,
left standard rudder?

428
00:48:27,387 --> 00:48:30,049
All engines ahead full, sir.

429
00:48:47,407 --> 00:48:51,434
The enemy's hiding on the bottom.
400 yards...

430
00:48:51,645 --> 00:48:56,014
...straight ahead.
Set your charges for 200 feet.

431
00:49:12,299 --> 00:49:16,133
Oil slick on the starboard beam, sir.
A direct hit.

432
00:49:18,572 --> 00:49:21,632
Keep scanning. Could be a Nai trick.

433
00:49:22,309 --> 00:49:26,302
Cut that light! I'm the friend
who guided you to the U-boat.

434
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:29,847
If you're friendly,
give the recognition signal!

435
00:49:30,017 --> 00:49:35,819
How can I convince you I'm a plain
American trying to serve my country?

436
00:49:36,356 --> 00:49:41,384
Give the recognition signal at once or
we'll commence firing depth charges.

437
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:46,294
Now, look! You were trying to locate
a submarine, weren't you?

438
00:49:46,466 --> 00:49:49,060
You couldn't find it, could you?

439
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,966
And I told you where it was, didn't I?

440
00:49:52,139 --> 00:49:55,165
And then you got it, didn't you?

441
00:49:57,044 --> 00:50:02,812
We cannot see you!
How are you staying afloat?

442
00:50:03,350 --> 00:50:07,309
I'd rather not say at the moment,
you wouldn't believe me.

443
00:50:07,521 --> 00:50:10,513
What the blasted blaes is this?

444
00:50:10,691 --> 00:50:15,685
If you wanna know who I am and what
I can do, bring George Stickle...

445
00:50:15,862 --> 00:50:20,231
...machinist mate second class,
and you'll learn the answer.

446
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,228
What do you make of it?

447
00:50:23,403 --> 00:50:26,395
Probably a Nai trick,
just as you said, sir.

448
00:50:26,573 --> 00:50:29,542
You want to meet
with somebody called Pickle?

449
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:32,702
Not Pickle! Stickle!

450
00:50:33,013 --> 00:50:37,973
Machinist Mate Second Class
George Stickle!

451
00:50:38,151 --> 00:50:41,348
On the USS Elias J. Starbright!

452
00:50:41,955 --> 00:50:46,619
I'll do what I can. I'll send
a full report of this meeting in...

453
00:50:46,793 --> 00:50:49,125
...but I can't guarantee Pickle.

454
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,490
Stickle!

455
00:50:50,697 --> 00:50:55,031
Good. I'll be at this same spot
three days from now.

456
00:50:59,706 --> 00:51:03,369
Left full rudder,
all engines ahead full.

457
00:51:04,511 --> 00:51:07,537
Wait till this hits the Navy department.

458
00:51:09,583 --> 00:51:14,350
Harlock, you've either been drinking
or you've got combat fatigue!

459
00:51:14,788 --> 00:51:20,226
Believe me, admiral, this voice
seemed to come right out of the water!

460
00:51:20,827 --> 00:51:24,263
We haven't time for nonsense.
We've got a war here.

461
00:51:24,431 --> 00:51:26,729
- That's just it, admiral.
- What is?

462
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:30,927
The voice... Whatever it is.
It seems to be most efficient.

463
00:51:31,104 --> 00:51:35,006
It led us to a Nai sub
and directed our charges accurately.

464
00:51:37,277 --> 00:51:38,938
All right, Harlock.

465
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:43,506
Let's say you heard this voice.
And it did what you say.

466
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:46,880
What's your explanation
for this phenomenon?

467
00:51:47,521 --> 00:51:52,823
I don't know, sir. I only know
that it's friendly and cooperative.

468
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:55,995
It wants to work with us.

469
00:51:56,296 --> 00:51:59,231
Blast it, Harlock!
We can't enlist a voice!

470
00:51:59,399 --> 00:52:02,334
Why? It directed our depth charges
correctly.

471
00:52:02,702 --> 00:52:06,570
I'm not going on record as the admiral
who was sent away...

472
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:10,107
...because he believed in voices
from the ocean.

473
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:13,802
Why not delegate the responsibility
to someone else?

474
00:52:14,281 --> 00:52:18,342
There's nobody else cray enough
to take it. Except yourself.

475
00:52:20,921 --> 00:52:23,913
Oh, not me, admiral, l...

476
00:52:24,424 --> 00:52:27,791
Maybe Machinist Mate Second
Class Pickle... Stickle.

477
00:52:27,961 --> 00:52:29,223
Who is he?

478
00:52:29,496 --> 00:52:33,227
The voice asked us to bring Stickle
out to meet with him.

479
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,694
Or it.

480
00:52:36,036 --> 00:52:40,939
I think we can arrange a leave for you
immediately. Take a good long rest.

481
00:52:41,141 --> 00:52:44,907
Think what this means.
It could spot submarines all over.

482
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:48,445
Within a year we could break
the Nai U-boat threat.

483
00:52:50,717 --> 00:52:55,518
All right, Harlock. We'll arrange
for Stickle to meet with this voice.

484
00:52:55,689 --> 00:53:00,251
Until we learn the nature of this
device, it will remain top-secret.

485
00:53:00,427 --> 00:53:04,523
- No discussion of it beyond this room.
- Certainly, admiral.

486
00:53:04,798 --> 00:53:07,460
Except between Stickle and yourself.

487
00:53:07,634 --> 00:53:12,799
You're to shoulder complete
responsibility for this secret weapon.

488
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:25,979
Commander, you've got to believe me!
I know nothing of this.

489
00:53:26,152 --> 00:53:28,712
I'm just a machinist mate
second class...

490
00:53:28,889 --> 00:53:32,188
I know all about you, Pickle.
Uh, Stickle.

491
00:53:32,359 --> 00:53:35,157
I hunted through half the Navy
to find you.

492
00:53:35,328 --> 00:53:40,493
- Yes, sir, but may I ask...?
- You may not! I'll ask.

493
00:53:44,337 --> 00:53:48,603
You have been summoned here
by a voice from the sea.

494
00:53:50,944 --> 00:53:53,208
- I have, sir?
- Yes.

495
00:53:53,380 --> 00:53:58,079
It claims to be your friend. Who do
you know that might be down there?

496
00:53:58,251 --> 00:54:02,620
I don't know anyone down there, sir.
Maybe a buddy on a submarine.

497
00:54:02,789 --> 00:54:04,984
It did not come from a submarine.

498
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:08,753
So help me, sir,
I don't know anything about this!

499
00:54:08,929 --> 00:54:13,366
When the voice hails us, you'll
talk to it until we get a fix on it.

500
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,502
And destroy it if necessary.
Do you understand?

501
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,333
Yes, sir. Yes.

502
00:54:26,813 --> 00:54:29,304
Ahoy there!

503
00:54:34,654 --> 00:54:37,248
Ahoy out there!

504
00:54:37,424 --> 00:54:39,722
Did you hail us three days ago?

505
00:54:39,893 --> 00:54:41,383
I did!

506
00:54:47,867 --> 00:54:52,133
- Did you bring George Stickle?
- He's here.

507
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,403
Say something, quick!

508
00:54:58,812 --> 00:55:00,871
Talk, sailor!

509
00:55:03,016 --> 00:55:06,577
Ahoy... Ahoy there!

510
00:55:07,754 --> 00:55:09,949
This is George.

511
00:55:12,192 --> 00:55:14,387
George Stickle.

512
00:55:14,561 --> 00:55:18,827
Hi, George. This is Henry Limpet.

513
00:55:37,617 --> 00:55:42,179
George! Did you hear me?
This is Henry!

514
00:55:42,355 --> 00:55:44,687
How are you, George?

515
00:55:46,459 --> 00:55:51,522
Come on, sailor! For heaven's sake, get
a grip on yourself! Keep him occupied.

516
00:55:55,402 --> 00:56:01,341
Hello, Henry. It's good to hear you.

517
00:56:01,508 --> 00:56:05,239
- It's impossible! Limpet is dead!
- Just keep him talking.

518
00:56:05,412 --> 00:56:08,347
We've got four other ships
closing in on him.

519
00:56:11,484 --> 00:56:16,581
This is a real surprise, Henry.
Real!

520
00:56:17,023 --> 00:56:19,821
Everybody thinks you're dead.

521
00:56:19,993 --> 00:56:25,522
I'm not, George. I'm just...
Well, a little different.

522
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:30,827
- Sure sounds like Henry's voice.
- Sir?

523
00:56:31,004 --> 00:56:34,599
Radar can't detect anything.
There's no engine vibrations.

524
00:56:34,774 --> 00:56:37,436
We do have a hydrophone
fix on the voice.

525
00:56:37,610 --> 00:56:41,102
- Hit him with light.
- I've got to talk to you, George.

526
00:56:41,281 --> 00:56:43,374
It's awful urgent!

527
00:56:43,550 --> 00:56:47,611
George! George, why don't
you answer me?

528
00:56:47,787 --> 00:56:51,279
Turn that light off or I'll go away
right now!

529
00:56:51,458 --> 00:56:53,949
Secure that light!

530
00:56:54,494 --> 00:56:57,327
That's better.
Now, listen to me, George.

531
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:02,833
Have them put you in a little boat all
alone, and come out here to meet me.

532
00:57:03,002 --> 00:57:06,199
Break out a rubber life raft.

533
00:57:08,141 --> 00:57:10,837
Rubber...?

534
00:57:12,045 --> 00:57:13,034
Oh, no!

535
00:57:13,580 --> 00:57:14,842
You can't make me...

536
00:57:15,014 --> 00:57:18,916
You're the key to this mystery,
Stickle. You have to go.

537
00:57:19,085 --> 00:57:23,988
Don't worry, we'll give you a strong
flashlight. Put him in the boat.

538
00:57:47,213 --> 00:57:52,776
Henry, it's me. George Stickle.

539
00:57:52,952 --> 00:57:55,512
I'm right here, George!

540
00:57:55,688 --> 00:58:00,182
Where? Where, I don't see you.

541
00:58:03,696 --> 00:58:09,760
- Don't turn that flashlight on.
- No, no, no, certainly not, Henry.

542
00:58:09,936 --> 00:58:13,531
You don't know how glad
I am to see you, George.

543
00:58:13,706 --> 00:58:19,201
Look, if you're really Henry, what are
you doing out here in the ocean?

544
00:58:19,379 --> 00:58:23,509
Remember when you jumped in the
water after me at Coney Island?

545
00:58:23,683 --> 00:58:25,480
I sure do.

546
00:58:25,652 --> 00:58:29,053
Didn't you see a fish?
A rather strange fish?

547
00:58:29,222 --> 00:58:31,884
Well, no. No, I don't think...

548
00:58:32,458 --> 00:58:35,586
Hey, wait. I did!

549
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,993
And I thought it was wearing
glasses like yours...

550
00:58:39,165 --> 00:58:42,396
...only I was so upset,
it was just my imagination.

551
00:58:42,569 --> 00:58:44,901
No, George, that was me.

552
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:49,303
You?! You, a fish!

553
00:58:50,243 --> 00:58:56,512
If you were a fish, you certainly would
need to wear your glasses, Henry.

554
00:58:56,749 --> 00:58:59,684
If you'll pardon me now,
I gotta get going.

555
00:58:59,852 --> 00:59:03,151
All right, I suppose
you have to see to believe.

556
00:59:03,323 --> 00:59:05,883
You can turn the light on me.

557
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,371
Now do you believe me, George?

558
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:29,612
Excuse me a minute. Gotta go down
for air. You know, a fish out of water.

559
00:59:31,484 --> 00:59:33,349
No!

560
00:59:35,221 --> 00:59:37,746
Oh, it's impossible!

561
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:42,818
Remember how you'd
come over on Friday nights?

562
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:47,296
You and Bessie would play poker
while I read myself to sleep?

563
00:59:47,634 --> 00:59:52,094
That's right. Regular as clockwork,
every Friday night.

564
00:59:52,272 --> 00:59:55,673
How about the time the three of us
went to the oo?

565
00:59:55,842 --> 01:00:01,303
I got separated from you two. I had
to walk home. Bessie had my cash.

566
01:00:02,148 --> 01:00:05,879
Oh, yes, I'll never forget that.

567
01:00:06,185 --> 01:00:08,346
Hey, wait a minute!

568
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:12,821
Only Henry Limpet would know all that!

569
01:00:15,962 --> 01:00:20,661
- You are Henry!
- Yes, George.

570
01:00:20,933 --> 01:00:25,836
Is there...? Is there anything
I can do for you, Henry?

571
01:00:26,005 --> 01:00:30,442
Well, I wanted to talk to you about
my helping the Navy.

572
01:00:30,610 --> 01:00:34,046
- You, in the Navy?!
- Yeah, I want to help.

573
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:38,047
I can help spot Nai subs
or guide destroyers to them.

574
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:43,120
Maybe scouting around as an underseas
patrol, or doens of things.

575
01:00:43,289 --> 01:00:48,454
Sure, Henry. I see where
you'd be quite a help to the Navy.

576
01:00:48,961 --> 01:00:51,156
Speak to the Navy right away.

577
01:00:51,331 --> 01:00:55,267
Go right to the top. I don't want
to waste time on red tape.

578
01:00:55,435 --> 01:00:59,201
Well, I want to know about Bessie.
Is she all right?

579
01:01:01,708 --> 01:01:05,474
She's still in a state of shock
about your being drowned.

580
01:01:05,778 --> 01:01:08,440
You can tell her now
I wasn't drowned.

581
01:01:08,614 --> 01:01:12,277
Gosh, Henry, you certainly
do sound different.

582
01:01:12,452 --> 01:01:16,218
- You really have changed!
- You don't know the half of it.

583
01:01:16,389 --> 01:01:20,325
Nothing like realiing your value
to make a man out of you.

584
01:01:20,493 --> 01:01:24,486
Even if that man is a fish. Tell me
when there's word from the Navy.

585
01:01:25,098 --> 01:01:28,397
Yes, I'll certainly
do the best I can, Henry.

586
01:01:28,568 --> 01:01:32,265
If we ever need you, we'll just
use the oscillator gear.

587
01:01:32,438 --> 01:01:35,373
- You think you can hear it?
- I'll hear it.

588
01:01:35,541 --> 01:01:39,807
I've stayed above too long.
Wonderful talking to you. See you!

589
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:46,513
Goodbye, Henry.

590
01:01:51,157 --> 01:01:53,148
A fish!

591
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:55,224
Harlock, you're cracking up.

592
01:01:55,395 --> 01:01:58,296
We have to admit
there's something out there.

593
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:02,264
Call it a fish, or a secret weapon,
or whatever you wish...

594
01:02:02,468 --> 01:02:05,767
...but it's there!
Pickle, Stickle saw it.

595
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:08,702
Talked to it.
And it's offered to help.

596
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:17,049
All right, Harlock. We'll assign
this secret weapon to your ship.

597
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:20,481
- Let it help you if you think it can.
- Thank you.

598
01:02:20,686 --> 01:02:24,315
But please stop bringing
these fantastic reports to me.

599
01:02:24,524 --> 01:02:29,291
I'm gonna have a hard enough time
explaining this to the Pentagon.

600
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:32,953
- I understand.
- And this is still top-secret.

601
01:02:33,132 --> 01:02:34,690
Your secret, Harlock!

602
01:02:35,201 --> 01:02:40,867
Yes, admiral. I was at the point of
calling you about that secret weapon.

603
01:02:41,073 --> 01:02:43,837
Oh, wonderful progress, sir,
wonderful.

604
01:02:44,043 --> 01:02:48,002
Research phase accomplished,
operational testing underway.

605
01:02:48,214 --> 01:02:50,978
Oh, one little thing, sir.

606
01:02:51,150 --> 01:02:55,246
This mission merits our pushing through
a rating for Stickle...

607
01:02:55,421 --> 01:02:59,619
...and a promotion for Harlock.
No, no, sir.

608
01:02:59,826 --> 01:03:04,729
I wasn't expecting anything
for myself. No, just doing my duty.

609
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:10,927
Of course, if you insist.

610
01:03:14,373 --> 01:03:15,863
Vice admiral.

611
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:25,143
Hello, George. I heard the oscillator
and got here as fast as I could.

612
01:03:25,351 --> 01:03:28,445
- Good news?
- Very good news, Henry.

613
01:03:28,654 --> 01:03:31,817
The Navy has agreed
to accept your services.

614
01:03:32,024 --> 01:03:35,687
We've been assigned
to Commander Harlock's destroyer.

615
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:39,490
- That's wonderful.
- That's quite an honor, Henry.

616
01:03:39,699 --> 01:03:43,897
- Very unusual for a civilian.
- Very unusual for a fish too.

617
01:03:44,103 --> 01:03:46,298
Here's the hydrophone.

618
01:03:46,506 --> 01:03:51,000
Oh, a water-talkie. Thanks.

619
01:04:06,092 --> 01:04:07,559
Limpet to Stickle.

620
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:09,057
Okay.

621
01:04:09,228 --> 01:04:12,629
Henry. Now, hear this.

622
01:04:12,832 --> 01:04:17,235
They'd like you to give the Navy
a little assist.

623
01:04:17,436 --> 01:04:21,668
Just hunt down Nai U-boats
and lead us to them.

624
01:04:21,874 --> 01:04:24,308
You'll be under my direct command.

625
01:04:24,510 --> 01:04:28,606
- I'm your liaison with the fleet.
- I like that, George.

626
01:04:28,814 --> 01:04:33,649
It won't be necessary for you to
salute me or address me as "sir"...

627
01:04:33,853 --> 01:04:39,291
...even though I've been promoted
to piscatorial specialist first class.

628
01:04:39,492 --> 01:04:44,725
- Fine. Now, what's the first order?
- They go on the prowl at 1:00.

629
01:04:44,931 --> 01:04:48,992
- How do we keep in contact?
- Signal me through the oscillator...

630
01:04:49,201 --> 01:04:52,568
...and I'll signal you with my thrum.
- Your what?

631
01:04:52,772 --> 01:04:57,971
It's a remarkable sound I make now.
Goes over big underwater. Like this:

632
01:05:07,086 --> 01:05:09,054
Did you hear it?

633
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:14,721
Sure did. I'll pick that up, all right.

634
01:05:16,062 --> 01:05:20,431
Good luck, Henry.
And full speed ahead.

635
01:05:20,633 --> 01:05:22,760
Aye, aye, George.

636
01:05:40,753 --> 01:05:43,551
Drop your charges! Hurry!

637
01:07:39,705 --> 01:07:42,606
The answer to Das Limpet.

638
01:07:45,111 --> 01:07:48,911
With the thrum sound-maker.

639
01:07:53,419 --> 01:07:57,515
The führer's super-secret weapon!

640
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:11,133
The perfect Nai counter-weapon to
blit the American underwater secret.

641
01:08:17,510 --> 01:08:23,676
Our new beeper torpedoes will react
to the thrum, and boom!

642
01:08:38,164 --> 01:08:41,964
You're doing a very nice job.
Captain Harlock is pleased.

643
01:08:42,168 --> 01:08:44,329
I'm glad, George.

644
01:08:45,137 --> 01:08:47,901
Isn't that a new rating
you're sporting?

645
01:08:49,775 --> 01:08:55,179
Yeah, they gave me
this little promotion here.

646
01:08:55,381 --> 01:08:57,440
Chief petty officer, you know.

647
01:08:57,650 --> 01:09:03,953
Skipper too. He's a four-striper now.
And Admiral Spewter, our big boss...

648
01:09:04,156 --> 01:09:06,624
...he's moving right up there.

649
01:09:06,826 --> 01:09:11,126
Congratulations.
I suppose I'm in all the papers.

650
01:09:11,330 --> 01:09:13,025
You? Well...

651
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:19,004
Well, no, you're not, Henry.

652
01:09:19,205 --> 01:09:20,968
Why not?

653
01:09:22,641 --> 01:09:24,575
You're top-secret.

654
01:09:24,777 --> 01:09:29,476
- We can't let a thing like this out.
- Yeah, I suppose not.

655
01:09:29,682 --> 01:09:34,813
There's a couple of things I must talk
to you about. Very important.

656
01:09:36,622 --> 01:09:41,059
Gentlemen, this is the rendevous
point for the mammoth convoy.

657
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:45,993
Captain Harlock's destroyer will
assume a vanguard position there.

658
01:09:46,198 --> 01:09:52,660
And the Limpet will be out
in front of Harlock.

659
01:09:56,108 --> 01:10:00,511
This convoy must get through safely.
On its safe voyage depends...

660
01:10:00,679 --> 01:10:03,113
...the Allies' greatest effort:

661
01:10:03,515 --> 01:10:06,348
The invasion of Europe!

662
01:10:13,826 --> 01:10:18,559
I'm Captain Harlock. I'm sorry
to interrupt, but it's rather urgent.

663
01:10:18,764 --> 01:10:21,494
- It may change plans for the convoy.
- Yes.

664
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:26,160
May I speak with Admiral Spewter?
It concerns the liaison problem...

665
01:10:26,372 --> 01:10:30,308
...with the secret weapon.
- Yes, certainly.

666
01:10:33,412 --> 01:10:34,902
Excuse me, sir.

667
01:10:35,114 --> 01:10:38,277
The cruiser Los Angeles
will be the guide.

668
01:10:38,484 --> 01:10:42,978
Vice Admiral Jones will be the OTC
and will fly his flag...

669
01:10:43,188 --> 01:10:47,921
All right, Harlock. What is it?
You interrupted an important briefing.

670
01:10:48,127 --> 01:10:52,257
Stickle has relayed a request
from the secret weapon.

671
01:10:52,464 --> 01:10:55,524
I told you that was
your responsibility.

672
01:10:55,701 --> 01:10:58,499
I know, but I don't
have the authority...

673
01:10:58,671 --> 01:11:02,402
...to act on this unusual request.

674
01:11:03,742 --> 01:11:06,609
- Now what?
- He wants to be paid.

675
01:11:06,979 --> 01:11:07,968
What?

676
01:11:11,383 --> 01:11:16,013
Are you out of your mind, Harlock?
How can we pay a fish?

677
01:11:16,221 --> 01:11:19,418
He wants the pay sent
to his wife in Brooklyn.

678
01:11:20,526 --> 01:11:23,893
The fish has a wife in Brooklyn?

679
01:11:24,063 --> 01:11:26,497
She's not a fish. She's a real woman.

680
01:11:26,699 --> 01:11:30,999
I should've thrown you out
when you came to me with this story.

681
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:34,104
All right, I suppose
we can find some way...

682
01:11:34,306 --> 01:11:37,537
...to push this through
the paymaster's office.

683
01:11:37,743 --> 01:11:42,203
- British screening units will deploy
to their assigned ports...

684
01:11:42,381 --> 01:11:44,406
There's more?

685
01:11:45,584 --> 01:11:48,382
He also wants
a lieutenant's commission.

686
01:11:48,587 --> 01:11:51,750
No. Absolutely, no!

687
01:11:55,694 --> 01:12:01,098
It's impossible to hold two meetings
here at once. May I join yours?

688
01:12:01,300 --> 01:12:04,736
I'm sorry. The news Harlock
brought is disturbing.

689
01:12:04,937 --> 01:12:07,838
If it concerns the weapon,
I'd like to hear.

690
01:12:08,040 --> 01:12:14,377
Our secret weapon wants to be paid.
He wants a lieutenant's commission.

691
01:12:14,580 --> 01:12:20,849
Then Admiral Spewter, I suggest you
pay and commission him. Immediately!

692
01:12:21,053 --> 01:12:24,079
Commission?
But, sir, you don't understand.

693
01:12:24,289 --> 01:12:30,023
I understand the secret weapon is the
key to the safe conduct of our convoy.

694
01:12:30,229 --> 01:12:34,256
I order you to commission
the secret weapon personally!

695
01:12:49,415 --> 01:12:53,408
Henry's here now, sir.
You ready to begin the ceremonies?

696
01:13:01,960 --> 01:13:04,690
Henry Limpet,
this is to inform you that...

697
01:13:04,897 --> 01:13:09,596
Sir. No, sir.
He's over that way, sir.

698
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:14,865
I think you can see him out there.
Port beam. You can see him, can't you?

699
01:13:15,074 --> 01:13:17,634
I might if I cared to look.

700
01:13:18,544 --> 01:13:24,779
- Limpet, raise your right hand.
- Sir, sir...

701
01:13:28,921 --> 01:13:34,951
Raise your right fin
and I will now swear you in...

702
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:38,323
...Lieutenant Limpet.

703
01:13:39,798 --> 01:13:44,030
A check for me? From the Navy?

704
01:13:44,870 --> 01:13:46,599
What does it mean, George?

705
01:13:46,805 --> 01:13:50,366
It's made out to you,
but it's for Henry's services.

706
01:13:50,576 --> 01:13:53,909
Henry? When was Henry
ever in the Navy?

707
01:13:54,113 --> 01:13:57,514
You better get a grip
on yourself, Bessie.

708
01:13:57,716 --> 01:14:00,480
He's in the Navy right now.

709
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:05,554
- Henry's alive?
- Yes, but you see that...

710
01:14:05,757 --> 01:14:08,726
I'm going to him.
I'm going this minute.

711
01:14:08,927 --> 01:14:11,589
- Now, Bessie.
- Take me to him.

712
01:14:11,797 --> 01:14:15,426
- Now, Bessie.
- Why wasn't I told this before?

713
01:14:15,634 --> 01:14:19,798
How long has he been alive?
I mean, when did he...?

714
01:14:20,005 --> 01:14:22,098
- He didn't drown?
- No.

715
01:14:22,307 --> 01:14:26,710
No, but brace yourself, Bessie.

716
01:14:26,879 --> 01:14:28,779
He's changed.

717
01:14:28,981 --> 01:14:32,781
You can't see him.
You wouldn't want to.

718
01:14:32,985 --> 01:14:37,820
I do want to. How can you say a thing
like that? Why can't I see him?

719
01:14:38,023 --> 01:14:42,050
It's impossible.
His work for the Navy is top-secret.

720
01:14:42,261 --> 01:14:48,063
Just be happy with his paycheck.
Don't even mention his name to anyone.

721
01:14:48,467 --> 01:14:53,632
- There's something fishy about this.
- You said it.

722
01:14:54,006 --> 01:14:57,271
A Mrs. Fish? What about a Mrs. Fish?

723
01:14:57,476 --> 01:15:01,378
No. Not a Mrs. Fish, sir.
Mrs. Limpet.

724
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:04,140
- The wife of the fish.
- Spewter...

725
01:15:04,349 --> 01:15:07,750
She's a forceful woman,
headstrong and determined.

726
01:15:07,953 --> 01:15:12,185
She demands that we change
her husband back into a man.

727
01:15:12,391 --> 01:15:17,886
Sounds like a most humane
and reasonable request. Do it!

728
01:15:18,497 --> 01:15:20,192
Do it.

729
01:15:21,700 --> 01:15:24,828
I beg your pardon, sir.
How do we do it?

730
01:15:25,037 --> 01:15:28,564
- You claim he turned into a fish.
- So I understand.

731
01:15:28,774 --> 01:15:32,904
Then it's simple.
Just reverse the process.

732
01:15:34,146 --> 01:15:36,137
Reverse?

733
01:15:38,517 --> 01:15:41,645
- We'll try, sir.
- You'll do nothing of the sort.

734
01:15:41,853 --> 01:15:44,253
We have a weapon of effectiveness.

735
01:15:44,423 --> 01:15:48,154
Guard it with your life.
Don't even touch it, understand?

736
01:15:48,594 --> 01:15:52,462
Now, never come to me again
with a request like that.

737
01:15:52,664 --> 01:15:56,498
At a time like this.
When we have a convoy on our hands...

738
01:15:56,702 --> 01:15:59,296
...ready for the biggest push
of the war.

739
01:16:30,936 --> 01:16:36,465
If Bessie could see me now.
Not bad for a 4-F fish.

740
01:16:36,675 --> 01:16:40,509
The spearhead of the spearhead.

741
01:16:40,979 --> 01:16:46,349
Imagine! This might make me
a national hero.

742
01:18:39,431 --> 01:18:43,993
My glasses. I must find my glasses.

743
01:18:44,202 --> 01:18:48,866
The convoy. I'm losing the convoy.

744
01:18:49,074 --> 01:18:51,668
Without my glasses, we're sunk.

745
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:56,508
Sunk? Just when the Navy
needs me most.

746
01:19:33,718 --> 01:19:38,417
Himmel and Blitels!
It's that female Flatbush.

747
01:19:40,625 --> 01:19:44,117
Ladyfish, got a message
for you from Limpet.

748
01:19:45,096 --> 01:19:49,123
He said he loves you
and other such mush like that.

749
01:19:49,768 --> 01:19:51,463
He loves me?

750
01:19:51,636 --> 01:19:54,537
Oh, he loves me!

751
01:19:56,842 --> 01:20:01,939
I don't love you, he does.
Silly female.

752
01:20:46,892 --> 01:20:51,261
Oh, Crusty, do you think
he'll ever come back?

753
01:20:51,463 --> 01:20:54,660
Don't get yourself into
a tiy now, Ladyfish.

754
01:20:54,866 --> 01:20:58,302
If I know Flatbush, he'll be back.

755
01:20:58,703 --> 01:21:00,330
Listen!

756
01:21:01,172 --> 01:21:03,402
Listen! It's him.

757
01:21:04,409 --> 01:21:06,274
It's Limpet!

758
01:21:19,858 --> 01:21:21,621
Ladyfish.

759
01:21:21,826 --> 01:21:26,991
Limpet, I've never heard anything more
beautiful than that noise you make.

760
01:21:27,198 --> 01:21:32,795
Ladyfish, I'm in terrible trouble.
I can't see.

761
01:21:33,004 --> 01:21:35,097
Come along.

762
01:21:35,507 --> 01:21:36,906
Any sign of him yet?

763
01:21:38,176 --> 01:21:40,144
Not yet, sir.

764
01:21:40,345 --> 01:21:44,748
He better show up soon or the whole
operation will be snafued.

765
01:21:48,520 --> 01:21:52,581
I'm not completely blind,
but things are awful fuy.

766
01:21:52,791 --> 01:21:55,487
Flatbush, what in tarnation...?

767
01:21:55,694 --> 01:21:59,255
I'm in an awful predicament.
I need some glasses, and...

768
01:21:59,464 --> 01:22:01,932
I noticed you were missing
some eyes.

769
01:22:02,133 --> 01:22:06,263
I've got to get back to my convoy!
But how will I find it?

770
01:22:06,471 --> 01:22:12,933
I'll be your eyes. I'll climb
topside and serve as your navigator.

771
01:22:13,144 --> 01:22:18,309
The sound of the convoy will guide
me, and with you navigating, why...

772
01:22:18,883 --> 01:22:22,182
- I can't ask you to risk your life.
- Risk my life?

773
01:22:22,387 --> 01:22:23,945
Hold everything.

774
01:22:25,290 --> 01:22:29,454
Maybe I ought to put on something
more torpedo-proof.

775
01:22:41,306 --> 01:22:44,434
- Ladyfish...
- Limpet.

776
01:22:44,643 --> 01:22:49,910
- I've got to go now. I'm on duty.
- Does that mean you'll be leaving me?

777
01:22:50,115 --> 01:22:52,879
Don't you care for me at all, Limpet?

778
01:22:53,084 --> 01:22:58,112
But I have an important job to do
before we can talk about that anymore.

779
01:22:58,323 --> 01:23:00,848
Let's shove off.

780
01:23:02,060 --> 01:23:04,790
- Then I'm going with you too.
- You can't.

781
01:23:04,963 --> 01:23:08,364
It's a very dangerous mission.
Wait for me here.

782
01:23:08,566 --> 01:23:12,366
All right, cast off. Full speed ahead.

783
01:23:12,904 --> 01:23:16,533
No, hard aport. Full reverse.

784
01:23:16,741 --> 01:23:20,233
Come about full,
then steady as she goes.

785
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:25,579
I'll always wait for you, Limpet.

786
01:23:36,695 --> 01:23:41,632
Slow down, gosh darn it. I ain't got
the hang of steering you yet.

787
01:23:43,702 --> 01:23:45,192
Haul up your keel!

788
01:23:47,539 --> 01:23:50,531
Darned near shivered your timbers
that time.

789
01:23:51,943 --> 01:23:56,380
Dagnab it. Hey, Flatbush, wait!

790
01:23:56,581 --> 01:23:59,550
Hold it! Wait!

791
01:24:04,422 --> 01:24:06,253
He makes a...

792
01:24:07,392 --> 01:24:09,417
A thrum.

793
01:24:09,627 --> 01:24:12,187
Sorry, chief, no thrums.

794
01:24:12,397 --> 01:24:13,887
Stickle!

795
01:24:14,566 --> 01:24:18,195
Any contact with that
piscatorial lieutenant pal?

796
01:24:18,403 --> 01:24:22,965
- We're nearing enemy water, Stickle.
- Sir, it's not my fault.

797
01:24:23,408 --> 01:24:25,603
Maybe Henry has laryngitis.

798
01:24:25,810 --> 01:24:28,074
Me and my secret weapon!

799
01:24:30,248 --> 01:24:35,049
We've come quite a way. I still can't
pick up any sound of the convoy.

800
01:24:35,253 --> 01:24:37,187
Do you see anything?

801
01:24:37,388 --> 01:24:42,485
No. Say, why don't you make that
whale-busting noise of yours again?

802
01:24:42,694 --> 01:24:47,290
- Let them know you're on your way.
- I should've thought of that.

803
01:24:47,499 --> 01:24:50,935
Just hold up a minute
till I get inside.

804
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:24,126
I hear the convoy now. Dead ahead.

805
01:25:33,978 --> 01:25:39,075
- Hooray, we finally made it!
- Stop. Hold it. Hold it.

806
01:25:39,651 --> 01:25:42,677
Whole school of big ones,
coming dead at us.

807
01:25:57,602 --> 01:26:00,969
Hard right rudder. Hard right.

808
01:26:01,139 --> 01:26:02,936
They're attacking our convoy!

809
01:26:19,924 --> 01:26:22,392
They're coming at us!

810
01:26:23,628 --> 01:26:28,531
Stop making that whale-busting thrum
of yours. Those things go for it.

811
01:26:28,733 --> 01:26:32,635
Yeah, how about that?
Then I'll just keep it up.

812
01:26:32,837 --> 01:26:36,000
Follow me, you beeping devil.

813
01:26:39,978 --> 01:26:43,709
We'll take it right back
where it came from.

814
01:26:56,461 --> 01:27:01,364
- What's happening below?
- I don't know, sir. Might be Henry.

815
01:27:01,566 --> 01:27:04,296
Something big is going on down there.

816
01:27:09,474 --> 01:27:12,238
Them torpedoes pack
a walloping thrum too.

817
01:27:12,844 --> 01:27:15,142
Great! They hit their own boats.

818
01:27:23,755 --> 01:27:29,387
We've got the system now. We'll just
let them knock themselves out.

819
01:28:03,127 --> 01:28:05,721
We gonna drop depth charges, skipper?

820
01:28:05,930 --> 01:28:07,158
No, we don't dare.

821
01:28:10,335 --> 01:28:12,826
Crash dive!

822
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:16,671
Help!

823
01:28:28,720 --> 01:28:30,984
It's about time you showed up.

824
01:29:22,874 --> 01:29:23,863
George.

825
01:29:24,075 --> 01:29:28,808
I gotta talk to George Stickle.

826
01:29:29,013 --> 01:29:31,573
George Stickle.

827
01:29:43,394 --> 01:29:44,452
Henry!

828
01:29:45,897 --> 01:29:51,426
Where have you been? You put me in
a terrible spot when we lost contact.

829
01:29:51,636 --> 01:29:55,333
I'm sorry, George.
I had a little accident.

830
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:57,565
I lost my glasses.

831
01:29:57,775 --> 01:29:59,902
Nice work anyhow, Henry.

832
01:30:00,111 --> 01:30:04,571
I'll see Bessie when we get back
and have her get you a new pair.

833
01:30:04,782 --> 01:30:07,842
We'll meet at Coney Island
when this is over.

834
01:30:08,052 --> 01:30:14,389
Aye, aye, George. See you at Coney
when it's all over. Carry on.

835
01:30:44,989 --> 01:30:48,948
Limpet, you did come back.

836
01:30:49,160 --> 01:30:53,392
Yes, Ladyfish. And you did wait.

837
01:30:53,598 --> 01:30:57,500
- You're coming with me now?
- No, but you're coming with me.

838
01:30:57,702 --> 01:31:03,504
You see, I love you, but I don't know
if I have any right to.

839
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:06,836
I've got to talk to my wife first.

840
01:31:07,311 --> 01:31:11,111
You and I have to make
a trip to Coney Island.

841
01:31:12,083 --> 01:31:14,950
I can be your other eyes now.

842
01:31:15,153 --> 01:31:20,591
Take over. I'm not going.
I'd probably drown in all the slush.

843
01:31:20,791 --> 01:31:23,919
Thanks for all your
wonderful help, Crusty.

844
01:31:24,128 --> 01:31:27,495
Forget it. I like the bachelor life.

845
01:31:27,698 --> 01:31:30,690
So long, Flatbush.

846
01:31:31,669 --> 01:31:34,467
Hate to admit it,
but I'm gonna miss him.

847
01:31:34,672 --> 01:31:38,938
Had to lose my best buddy
to a frilly female.

848
01:31:39,710 --> 01:31:44,010
Better get rid of this battle gear
and get back to my civvies.

849
01:31:44,815 --> 01:31:48,216
What if I told you I was
once a human being?

850
01:31:48,419 --> 01:31:52,116
I don't care how terrible
your past was, Limpet.

851
01:31:52,290 --> 01:31:54,850
I'll help you forget.

852
01:31:55,059 --> 01:31:57,823
I've forgotten an awful lot already.

853
01:31:58,029 --> 01:32:00,896
So long, Flatbush.

854
01:32:07,805 --> 01:32:11,536
I'll never leave you,
and I hope you'll never leave me.

855
01:32:11,742 --> 01:32:14,973
It's always the males
who leave in our species.

856
01:32:15,179 --> 01:32:18,273
That's why there's so few of us.

857
01:32:18,649 --> 01:32:23,848
In that case, there might
be more before long.

858
01:32:25,189 --> 01:32:29,853
You and I could be the beginning
of a whole new and better world.

859
01:32:41,739 --> 01:32:45,971
I know where we are now. Follow me.

860
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:58,215
There, that's my wife.

861
01:32:58,422 --> 01:33:00,947
Not much to look at, is she?

862
01:33:01,158 --> 01:33:04,218
Actually, for a human,
she's quite lovely.

863
01:33:04,428 --> 01:33:10,298
Let's get this over with, Limpet.
The water here is very cold.

864
01:33:13,037 --> 01:33:14,197
Hello, Bessie.

865
01:33:18,342 --> 01:33:20,105
Henry, is that you?

866
01:33:20,311 --> 01:33:22,939
Don't you recognie me, Bessie?

867
01:33:30,221 --> 01:33:34,624
Henry, you really are...

868
01:33:34,825 --> 01:33:37,692
A fish? Yes, Bessie, you can say it.

869
01:33:38,429 --> 01:33:44,493
To think you're actually still alive,
and I'm married to a...

870
01:33:45,569 --> 01:33:47,560
A fish. Is that so terrible?

871
01:33:48,105 --> 01:33:50,801
It doesn't happen every day.

872
01:33:51,008 --> 01:33:56,708
Well, what's new? I mean,
how have you been, Bessie?

873
01:33:57,281 --> 01:33:58,771
Well, I'm...

874
01:34:00,184 --> 01:34:02,982
I'm bewildered, Henry.

875
01:34:03,521 --> 01:34:06,649
Henry, am I the widow of a man...

876
01:34:06,857 --> 01:34:10,293
...or the wife of a fish?

877
01:34:10,561 --> 01:34:14,930
Let's be logical. You couldn't
keep me in a tub, could you?

878
01:34:15,166 --> 01:34:17,896
I suppose not. No.

879
01:34:18,069 --> 01:34:22,472
- I mean, what would the neighbors say?
- I shudder to think.

880
01:34:22,673 --> 01:34:27,076
You know how that Miss Harris objects
every time I fry fish. Why...

881
01:34:27,278 --> 01:34:28,905
Oh, good heavens.

882
01:34:29,113 --> 01:34:30,580
Well, there you are.

883
01:34:32,717 --> 01:34:36,084
Are you really happier
down there, Henry?

884
01:34:36,287 --> 01:34:38,255
If you only knew, Bessie.

885
01:34:48,065 --> 01:34:52,729
I guess this is goodbye, Henry.

886
01:34:56,841 --> 01:35:01,471
If you'll come up to the steps,
I have something for you.

887
01:35:36,580 --> 01:35:39,606
Take care of yourself, Henry.

888
01:35:41,585 --> 01:35:45,316
Remember how you catch cold
when you get your feet wet.

889
01:35:45,523 --> 01:35:49,459
Don't break up, Bessie. I'm just fine.

890
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:55,621
Maybe I was meant to be a fish.
Maybe nature just corrected her error.

891
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:57,790
Maybe.

892
01:36:04,909 --> 01:36:06,467
Goodbye, Henry.

893
01:36:06,677 --> 01:36:12,843
Goodbye, Bessie. And thanks for being
sensible about this. And understanding.

894
01:36:13,717 --> 01:36:16,880
- Goodbye, Henry.
- So long, George.

895
01:36:17,087 --> 01:36:19,078
Take good care of Bessie.

896
01:36:19,256 --> 01:36:22,453
Tell them not to look for me.
They won't find me.

897
01:36:41,245 --> 01:36:45,477
"Goodbye, Henry," I said.
And I saluted.

898
01:36:45,649 --> 01:36:48,174
I thought that was it.

899
01:36:49,286 --> 01:36:53,188
Bessie and I have been happy.
Why stir this thing up again?

900
01:36:53,390 --> 01:36:56,223
The chief of naval operations
ordered it.

901
01:36:56,427 --> 01:37:00,329
Do they really think that Henry
is teaching porpoises?

902
01:37:00,498 --> 01:37:05,197
That's what we've been assigned to find
out. You and I, Pickle. Stickle.

903
01:37:05,402 --> 01:37:07,336
Where do we start to look?

904
01:37:07,738 --> 01:37:13,608
Maybe that spot off the Florida coast
where Henry first contacted you.

905
01:37:13,878 --> 01:37:17,473
It's worth a try. Get the old man.
He's going with us.

906
01:37:17,681 --> 01:37:22,550
The secretary of defense ordered
him to take command of this mission.

907
01:37:23,621 --> 01:37:29,856
"On behalf of the secretary of defense,
and speaking for a grateful nation...

908
01:37:30,027 --> 01:37:33,895
...I'm empowered to advance you
to the rank of commodore...

909
01:37:34,064 --> 01:37:36,498
...United States Naval Reserve."

910
01:37:39,670 --> 01:37:42,366
And now, commodore...

911
01:37:42,907 --> 01:37:46,240
...regarding porpoise activities...
