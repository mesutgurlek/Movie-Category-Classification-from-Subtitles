1
00:01:01,495 --> 00:01:03,122
August, 1944.

2
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,165
The outcome
of the Second World War appeared

3
00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:08,666
to be no longer in doubt.

4
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,661
Paris was liberated.

5
00:01:14,542 --> 00:01:16,510
After four years of fighting,

6
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,713
victory against
the Gremans seemed assured.

7
00:01:20,949 --> 00:01:23,247
Since the Normandy landings in June,

8
00:01:23,618 --> 00:01:28,146
American and Allied forces had battled
their way across ''Northern Europe,

9
00:01:28,457 --> 00:01:32,393
and pushed the German enemy
to within its own homeland.

10
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:04,720
The City of Light rejoiced as
it welcomed the troops.

11
00:02:14,307 --> 00:02:16,605
Marching down the Champs Elysees,

12
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:21,310
officers and men believed that Berlin
was within *their reach.

13
00:02:22,482 --> 00:02:24,109
And the word was that

14
00:02:24,251 --> 00:02:26,481
they would be home in time
for Christmas.

15
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,525
But when the soldiers left Paris
for the German border

16
00:02:36,197 --> 00:02:37,960
their hopes began to fade.

17
00:02:53,383 --> 00:02:55,442
I'm gonna make it.
You're gonna make it.

18
00:02:55,751 --> 00:02:57,776
I'm gonna make it.
You're gonna make it.

19
00:02:58,521 --> 00:02:59,488
My lucky day.

20
00:02:59,623 --> 00:03:00,590
It's your lucky day.

21
00:03:00,724 --> 00:03:01,418
I got the luck.

22
00:03:01,558 --> 00:03:02,616
You got it, Bobby.

23
00:03:04,228 --> 00:03:05,388
This is nothin' !

24
00:03:05,529 --> 00:03:06,518
It's walk in the park!

25
00:03:07,364 --> 00:03:08,490
Oh!

26
00:03:08,632 --> 00:03:09,326
What's that, partner?

27
00:03:09,467 --> 00:03:10,627
I get to go home.

28
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:11,756
You're goin' home, Bobby!

29
00:03:11,903 --> 00:03:13,029
I'm goin' home!

30
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,260
Goddamn right!

31
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,537
I'm goin' home!

32
00:03:15,673 --> 00:03:17,436
You know it, Bob!

33
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:19,699
Hang in there, Bobby.

34
00:03:20,178 --> 00:03:21,440
Hang in there.

35
00:03:21,646 --> 00:03:22,806
You can do this.

36
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:23,845
I can do this.

37
00:03:23,982 --> 00:03:25,415
You're tough as nails.

38
00:03:26,185 --> 00:03:27,277
Nails.

39
00:03:27,418 --> 00:03:28,715
Not good enough, Bobby.

40
00:03:29,088 --> 00:03:30,419
Nails!

41
00:03:31,023 --> 00:03:32,581
What about nails?

42
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:33,758
Tough!

43
00:03:33,893 --> 00:03:35,793
That's right, they're fuckin' tough!

44
00:03:39,466 --> 00:03:42,663
God damn you! stick with it, Bobby!

45
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:46,567
Fuckin' dig in, Bobby!
Come on, who's tough as nails?

46
00:03:46,707 --> 00:03:47,571
Me's tough.

47
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:50,040
That's right, you tough. Tough as what?

48
00:03:50,211 --> 00:03:50,973
Nails.

49
00:03:51,112 --> 00:03:52,238
That's right, now say it!

50
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:53,506
Tough as nalis!

51
00:03:53,648 --> 00:03:56,082
You're godammned right,
you're tough as nails!

52
00:03:58,687 --> 00:04:00,848
Come on, stay with us, Bobby.

53
00:04:01,123 --> 00:04:02,249
It hurts!

54
00:04:02,524 --> 00:04:04,014
I know, it's less than a mile.

55
00:04:04,393 --> 00:04:05,621
Less than a mile to go.

56
00:04:05,761 --> 00:04:06,489
It's too far.

57
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:08,256
No, it ain't, it ain't too far.

58
00:04:08,397 --> 00:04:09,591
Not gonna make it.

59
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:10,766
Can that shit!

60
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:12,026
Gonna die!

61
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,633
Cut it, you're gonna make it!

62
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,065
I'm gonna...

63
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:16,569
You're gonna make it.

64
00:04:16,773 --> 00:04:17,967
Make it.

65
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:20,672
You're damn right!

66
00:04:27,718 --> 00:04:35,420
Listen Bobby, I gotta rest for a minute
Okay? Okaym, Bob?

67
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:37,855
Shit!

68
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:47,769
Bobby! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

69
00:04:47,907 --> 00:04:52,003
Stop it! Bobby, stop it! Bobby! Bobby!

70
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:59,848
Welcome back, mother fucker!

71
00:05:33,723 --> 00:05:36,851
Promise me you won't pick me up no more

72
00:05:38,328 --> 00:05:43,095
It hurts.
Don't don't pick me up any more.

73
00:05:45,169 --> 00:05:50,402
Listen Bob, if I leave you,
ain't nobody gonna find you.

74
00:05:51,308 --> 00:05:53,299
You're gonna die out here.

75
00:05:53,477 --> 00:05:55,502
Just sit here for a bit.

76
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,645
I am dying.

77
00:06:08,527 --> 00:06:10,392
Bob, we can't sit here.

78
00:06:11,064 --> 00:06:13,123
So, I gotta pick you up,
and I gotta get you out of here.

79
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:14,164
No.

80
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,597
Come on.
No! No!

81
00:06:15,735 --> 00:06:17,862
No more! No more! No more, please
Let's go. let's go, Bob.

82
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:18,936
All right, all right!
All right, all right, all right!

83
00:06:19,072 --> 00:06:21,597
Relax! Relax! Relax!
No more. Please, no more.

84
00:06:21,742 --> 00:06:23,539
Fine, I'm not. I'm not gonna touch ya'.

85
00:06:23,776 --> 00:06:27,109
Okay, just realx. Just relax.

86
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:34,947
Just relax.

87
00:06:41,162 --> 00:06:50,264
No more. No more. No more.

88
00:07:10,962 --> 00:07:13,988
You're not gonna leave, are ya?

89
00:07:30,215 --> 00:07:32,649
Got no choice, Bob.

90
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,152
Okay.

91
00:08:21,572 --> 00:08:25,167
D, David...

92
00:08:26,743 --> 00:08:29,405
Don't leave me here like this.

93
00:08:30,547 --> 00:08:33,573
Please don't leave me here like this.

94
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:35,412
Don't you leave me here!

95
00:08:36,854 --> 00:08:42,815
David!
David, don't leave me here like this!

96
00:08:45,096 --> 00:08:46,791
Stop it!

97
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:50,291
Don't leave me here!

98
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:53,972
David...

99
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,008
All right, get outta here!

100
00:08:59,111 --> 00:09:00,806
Grab my hand, buddy. There you go.

101
00:09:06,519 --> 00:09:08,578
1,2,3, push!

102
00:09:16,897 --> 00:09:18,888
More bandages, hurry it up!

103
00:09:21,336 --> 00:09:22,394
Come on, get up!

104
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:24,629
Move that truck outta there!

105
00:09:28,578 --> 00:09:29,738
Where's C Company?

106
00:09:29,911 --> 00:09:30,843
You kidding?

107
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:40,446
Easy there, buddy. Hang in there.

108
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:43,153
Chamberlain!

109
00:09:43,327 --> 00:09:44,351
Grab an end!

110
00:09:49,366 --> 00:09:51,926
Captain Pritchett's been lookin'
for anybody from your platoon.

111
00:09:53,038 --> 00:09:54,130
Where is he?

112
00:09:54,306 --> 00:09:55,432
Back at HQ.

113
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,771
I'm headin' that direction
if you want a lift.

114
00:10:00,378 --> 00:10:01,845
Get down!

115
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:10,046
Shit!

116
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:12,052
You all right?

117
00:10:13,592 --> 00:10:15,924
Oh, my God! Oh God! Oh...

118
00:10:16,063 --> 00:10:17,655
Why do they leave them there like that?

119
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,694
Fuckin' brass!

120
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:20,458
They don't wanna waste
the trucks on the dead.

121
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,727
They still got more guys to haul in
for the slaughter.

122
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:24,797
No more room in Hell !

123
00:10:25,172 --> 00:10:28,266
What'rya talkin' about?
There's plenty of room.

124
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:30,442
All they gotta do is stack 'em higher.

125
00:10:30,777 --> 00:10:32,301
How many do you think?

126
00:10:32,513 --> 00:10:35,448
Hundreds.
That's just in the last five days.

127
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,551
How can they let this happen
and still pretend to be human beings?!

128
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:41,680
I haven't seen one of those sick fucks
over the rank

129
00:10:41,824 --> 00:10:43,314
of Captain here since I been up here.

130
00:10:43,591 --> 00:10:45,115
They're lookin' at points on a map!

131
00:10:45,561 --> 00:10:48,689
Not one of them has a fuckin' clue
what's goin' on up here.

132
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,494
Shit flows down.

133
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:54,727
Godammed right! Regiment wipes
its ass with Battalion,

134
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:56,565
Battalion wipes
its ass clean with Company,

135
00:10:56,706 --> 00:10:58,333
and we're left
to lick the shit off of them!

136
00:11:00,877 --> 00:11:02,071
Mark my words,

137
00:11:03,012 --> 00:11:06,106
they're gonna keep sendin' us in until
the whole fuckin' division is gone!

138
00:11:08,853 --> 00:11:10,582
Not me, Bedpan.

139
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,851
Captain Pritchett, sir?
You have a Private manning here.

140
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:41,884
All right.

141
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,088
You Manning?

142
00:11:48,762 --> 00:11:50,024
I think so.

143
00:11:50,165 --> 00:11:51,564
Give him a straight answer, Private.

144
00:11:51,699 --> 00:11:53,189
Relax!

145
00:11:56,538 --> 00:11:59,939
You can stop looking for your platoon.
They didn't make it.

146
00:12:01,277 --> 00:12:02,369
What?

147
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,740
Looks like you're the only one
who made it out.

148
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:06,177
Your lucky day.

149
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:08,812
Lucky day?

150
00:12:08,951 --> 00:12:10,009
You're alive!

151
00:12:10,152 --> 00:12:11,084
Am I?

152
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,482
If you don't put a sock in it,
Private...

153
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:13,315
You're gonna, what?

154
00:12:13,457 --> 00:12:17,553
Can it! Both of you!Lukas, take a walk!

155
00:12:21,097 --> 00:12:22,223
Fuckin' Greenie!

156
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,164
You better get used to him,
he's your new platoon leader.

157
00:12:26,304 --> 00:12:28,465
He'll be dead in a week.

158
00:12:29,273 --> 00:12:30,638
Tell me somethin'...

159
00:12:31,642 --> 00:12:33,041
You got your shit together?

160
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:34,642
Somethimes.

161
00:12:34,812 --> 00:12:36,109
What's that mean?

162
00:12:36,849 --> 00:12:39,044
It means that sometimes
I've got it together.

163
00:12:39,183 --> 00:12:40,514
On the line?

164
00:12:40,953 --> 00:12:44,320
Waht do you want...Captain?

165
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:46,287
The entire battalion took
a beating last night.

166
00:12:46,426 --> 00:12:49,725
I've heard seventy percent casualties,
but that's just talk.

167
00:12:50,028 --> 00:12:52,053
Whatever it is,
it must've crippled us bad.

168
00:12:52,464 --> 00:12:55,228
We've been pulled back without reaching
a single objective.

169
00:12:55,401 --> 00:12:57,301
What has this got to do with me?

170
00:12:57,604 --> 00:12:59,128
We're getting replacements
in from the Channel,

171
00:12:59,272 --> 00:13:01,433
tonight you'll be fit in with
a new squad.

172
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:05,505
Congratulations, Private,
you're a Sergeant now.

173
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:10,209
I don't want it.

174
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:10,943
You'll get used to it.

175
00:13:11,086 --> 00:13:13,145
I don't wanna get used to it!

176
00:13:13,522 --> 00:13:16,889
I don't give a damn what you want!

177
00:13:17,993 --> 00:13:19,517
I'll put up with that mouth of yours,

178
00:13:19,661 --> 00:13:22,528
because I figure after surviving
a week up here,

179
00:13:22,664 --> 00:13:24,063
you've earned that right.

180
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:27,032
You have not earned the right
to question my orders!

181
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:29,364
I am absolutely the wrong man!

182
00:13:29,539 --> 00:13:32,303
That may be your opinion, Sergeant,
but it's not mine.

183
00:13:32,508 --> 00:13:34,601
You've managed to stay alive for a week

184
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:36,778
That's something the rest
of your platoon couldn't do.

185
00:13:36,914 --> 00:13:38,779
Call me crazy,
but from where I'm standin',

186
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:40,816
that makes you qualified for the job.

187
00:13:42,485 --> 00:13:43,850
You're making a mistake.

188
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:48,784
Your opinion is duly noted, Sergeant.
Dismissed.

189
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:59,166
Sir...I, in the woods, I've done things

190
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,101
Sergeant.

191
00:14:00,238 --> 00:14:00,704
Yes?

192
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:01,897
Dismissed.

193
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,879
Request permission for a Section 8.

194
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:14,476
I'm fucked up, I can't do this,
I, I, I'm no good.

195
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:21,253
Listen to me, soldier, a week ago,
I had a company of almost 200men.

196
00:14:21,394 --> 00:14:23,123
Now I've got 50.

197
00:14:23,965 --> 00:14:26,490
As hard as this may
be for you to swallow,

198
00:14:26,633 --> 00:14:29,397
your efforts
to stay alive hold very little value

199
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:31,003
at this particular time and place.

200
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:33,402
What does hold value are the objectives

201
00:14:33,574 --> 00:14:34,836
The longer it takes to obtain them,

202
00:14:34,977 --> 00:14:37,309
the more dead we'll be stockpilin'
at the side of the road.

203
00:14:37,812 --> 00:14:39,643
Now it's my job
to obtain those objectives,

204
00:14:39,781 --> 00:14:42,341
and I will utilize anybody
at my disposal to do so.

205
00:14:42,484 --> 00:14:44,008
That includes you, Sergeant.

206
00:14:45,722 --> 00:14:48,247
Now I'm just as sorry as hell
about your bruised nerves,

207
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:49,618
but you are out of your skull

208
00:14:49,758 --> 00:14:52,886
if you think I'm gonna let you bail on
a Section 8. Is that clear?

209
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:54,257
Yes, Sir.

210
00:14:54,397 --> 00:14:57,423
At 1400 hours, you will rendezvous
with your new squad.

211
00:14:57,735 --> 00:14:59,600
You've got until
then to get your shit together.

212
00:14:59,737 --> 00:15:00,465
Is that clear?

213
00:15:00,603 --> 00:15:02,127
Yes, Sir.

214
00:15:02,373 --> 00:15:05,171
Good...Now, get out of my sight.

215
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:19,650
Captain...when I fuck this up,
is it your fault or mine?

216
00:15:33,072 --> 00:15:34,403
Mind if I tag along?

217
00:15:35,007 --> 00:15:36,099
Suppose not.

218
00:15:36,242 --> 00:15:37,732
I heard about your promotion.

219
00:15:38,178 --> 00:15:40,646
Yeah? Where'd you hear that?

220
00:15:41,581 --> 00:15:43,981
Pays to have friends, man.

221
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:44,947
Got a smoke?

222
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:46,109
Yeah.

223
00:16:01,303 --> 00:16:04,272
You know, it's amazing really,
when you stop to think about it.

224
00:16:05,741 --> 00:16:09,177
Whole platoon fingers its way
into the Factory and...

225
00:16:09,311 --> 00:16:10,801
one guy makes it out to talk about it.

226
00:16:12,448 --> 00:16:14,177
You got twentyfive or thirty guys dead

227
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:16,547
or dyin' and you walk out without
a scratch on ya.

228
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,148
It's my lucky day.

229
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:22,415
Yeah, lucky.
Well, that's one way of lookin' at it.

230
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:26,289
But not the only way...Right, Talbot?

231
00:16:27,498 --> 00:16:30,228
There isn't anything sacred with you,
is there, Manning?

232
00:16:30,367 --> 00:16:31,766
Warm, dry feet.

233
00:16:41,213 --> 00:16:42,771
How'd you manage to get out, Manning?

234
00:16:43,715 --> 00:16:46,047
Did you get cut off from
the rest of the platoon?

235
00:16:46,285 --> 00:16:48,879
Trees get pretty thick out there?
Did you get lost?

236
00:16:51,023 --> 00:16:52,388
Come on, what happened?

237
00:16:52,992 --> 00:16:55,620
You got somethin' in that vat of yours,
just spill it.

238
00:16:56,563 --> 00:16:58,497
All right. Look, it's like this.

239
00:16:58,698 --> 00:17:01,098
See, your routine
isn't as seamless as you think it is.

240
00:17:01,368 --> 00:17:04,963
Always hangin' back a little bit,
never volunteering.

241
00:17:05,372 --> 00:17:10,002
Doin just enough to keep outta trouble,
but never enough to really help out.

242
00:17:11,412 --> 00:17:13,471
I'm kind of an emotional guy.

243
00:17:14,849 --> 00:17:19,343
Get one thing fuckin' straight, man.
There is no hangback now.

244
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:22,451
You got a glob of greenies lookin'
at you to keep 'em alive,

245
00:17:22,591 --> 00:17:25,719
and if i find out that one
of them answers the last muster cause

246
00:17:25,861 --> 00:17:27,260
of your yellow streak,

247
00:17:27,396 --> 00:17:30,194
I will personally put a bullet
in your brain.

248
00:17:56,928 --> 00:17:58,259
Hey, Sandy!

249
00:17:59,531 --> 00:18:01,362
Hey, hey, hey! There he is!

250
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:02,125
Hey!

251
00:18:02,267 --> 00:18:04,428
All right! You made it!

252
00:18:04,636 --> 00:18:06,263
Where the hell'd you go,
I looked for you.

253
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:07,497
I got lost.

254
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,664
I thought you chickened out.

255
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:09,797
You thought he chickened out, me,

256
00:18:09,942 --> 00:18:12,342
I know he's just a dumb fuck farmer
from Wisconsin.

257
00:18:13,212 --> 00:18:14,338
Am I in trouble?

258
00:18:14,514 --> 00:18:15,981
Hell no, we're still waitin'
for the sergeant.

259
00:18:16,115 --> 00:18:16,877
How'd you get here?

260
00:18:17,150 --> 00:18:20,677
Guy about a mile back in a jeep
just told me to follow the road.

261
00:18:20,987 --> 00:18:21,954
Still don't know why
they sent us in here,

262
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:24,182
I hear the war's gonna
be over by Christmas.

263
00:18:24,358 --> 00:18:25,325
Who told you that shit?

264
00:18:25,626 --> 00:18:26,320
It's talk.

265
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,088
I heard the Krauts got nothin'
but old men and children on the line.

266
00:18:29,363 --> 00:18:30,387
And you believe that?

267
00:18:30,798 --> 00:18:31,890
I'd like to.

268
00:18:32,800 --> 00:18:33,732
How 'bout you, Sandy,

269
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:35,096
you believe that shit
about old men and kids?

270
00:18:35,236 --> 00:18:36,828
I will if you will.

271
00:18:38,306 --> 00:18:39,967
What are these?

272
00:18:41,443 --> 00:18:42,933
How the fuck should we know?

273
00:18:45,714 --> 00:18:51,812
They're called Dragon's Teeth.
Krauts use 'em to stop our tanks.

274
00:18:52,989 --> 00:18:55,150
You're standing on the Siegfried line.

275
00:18:56,392 --> 00:19:00,829
Over there is Germany.
I suggest your remember that.

276
00:19:06,904 --> 00:19:10,032
Let's go. You're with me.

277
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,040
We're goin' to the front.

278
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:40,165
All right, listen up.
Right over that hill is the front line.

279
00:20:41,707 --> 00:20:43,698
When you're in your foxholes,

280
00:20:43,876 --> 00:20:46,242
the Krauts are gonna be less
than fifty yards away.

281
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:48,705
This is thin line.

282
00:20:49,048 --> 00:20:51,278
Which means
we're gonna be spaced far apart.

283
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:55,853
Because in this fog,
you might not see the guy nearest you.

284
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,921
The Krauts are gonna hear us moving
into position,

285
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:00,526
and they know that you're replacements.

286
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,786
How?

287
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:04,088
This company lost over
a hundred men last night.

288
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:05,898
They know we're hurtin' bad,

289
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:08,763
and they know that we have to try
to bring in replacements today.

290
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:11,597
The only reason
they're not makin' a push,

291
00:21:11,739 --> 00:21:13,604
is because they're hurtin' too.

292
00:21:13,941 --> 00:21:17,934
They know you guys don't know shit.
They're gonna try to use it.

293
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,816
They'll call out to you in English,
they'll try to spook ya.

294
00:21:23,452 --> 00:21:27,445
The main thing you need to do
is keep your shit together.

295
00:21:28,557 --> 00:21:31,025
This is the real fuckin' deal.

296
00:21:33,296 --> 00:21:34,524
Name.

297
00:21:34,664 --> 00:21:35,460
Huh?

298
00:21:35,698 --> 00:21:36,528
Your name.

299
00:21:36,699 --> 00:21:37,393
Warren.

300
00:21:37,534 --> 00:21:38,466
Last name.

301
00:21:38,668 --> 00:21:40,101
Sanderson.

302
00:21:40,703 --> 00:21:46,300
Sanderson, you're first.
You stay right behind me.

303
00:21:46,544 --> 00:21:47,476
Okay.

304
00:21:47,678 --> 00:21:49,543
I'll be back for each of you,
one at time.

305
00:21:50,281 --> 00:21:52,977
Don't go wandering off now.

306
00:21:54,085 --> 00:21:57,384
I mean it. Stay right in my back pocket

307
00:21:58,156 --> 00:21:59,248
Let's go.

308
00:22:42,604 --> 00:22:44,469
Keep your fuckin' head down!

309
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:58,217
Move him out.

310
00:23:03,793 --> 00:23:05,727
Sure took your sweet time gettin' here.

311
00:23:07,565 --> 00:23:09,556
Anything notable?

312
00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:11,266
Those fucking tanks again.

313
00:23:11,936 --> 00:23:13,836
They've been jammin'
their barrels down our throat

314
00:23:13,971 --> 00:23:15,632
from that fuckin' high ground
for a week now.

315
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:18,570
Air Corps can't see 'em,
artillery can't hit 'em.

316
00:23:18,709 --> 00:23:19,869
They better find some way

317
00:23:20,012 --> 00:23:21,843
of knockin' those fuckers out
and I mean fast.

318
00:23:22,447 --> 00:23:23,641
What about the 88s?

319
00:23:23,782 --> 00:23:25,044
They're still out there.

320
00:23:25,317 --> 00:23:29,549
Tanks on our right side,

321
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:36,184
Fuckin' Army.

322
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:42,359
I'll be back, in the morning,
for patrol.

323
00:23:53,581 --> 00:23:54,206
Scared?

324
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:55,281
Huh?

325
00:23:56,283 --> 00:23:57,409
Scared?

326
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,051
Yeah.

327
00:24:01,957 --> 00:24:04,357
I don't know what I'm supposed to do.

328
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:06,319
Want me to tell ya?

329
00:24:06,462 --> 00:24:07,554
Okay.

330
00:24:08,831 --> 00:24:11,391
Basically, you're a lookout.

331
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:12,694
When you're down in here,

332
00:24:12,836 --> 00:24:16,067
you're responsible for holding
this section of the line. Okay?

333
00:24:16,273 --> 00:24:19,299
You got a machine gun nest protecting
you on your right flank,

334
00:24:19,443 --> 00:24:20,637
twentyfive yards away.

335
00:24:20,911 --> 00:24:23,778
You got another rifleman protecting
you on your left flank,

336
00:24:23,914 --> 00:24:26,678
a little closer, maybe fifteen,
twenty yards, okay?

337
00:24:26,817 --> 00:24:27,340
Okay.

338
00:24:27,485 --> 00:24:30,010
Now, in front of you,
you got your Krauts.

339
00:24:30,520 --> 00:24:34,183
They're close.
Thirty yards, maybe a little more.

340
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:36,156
The challenge is ''Hershey.''

341
00:24:36,294 --> 00:24:38,854
The password is ''apple.'' Okay?

342
00:24:39,163 --> 00:24:41,063
You say ''Hershey''
and you don't hear ''apple,''

343
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,792
you open fire, you understand?

344
00:24:42,935 --> 00:24:44,869
You don't think about it,
you don't hesitate,

345
00:24:45,004 --> 00:24:46,596
you just do it, you understand?

346
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:49,774
Otherwise, you're gonna go home
to your mama in a box, all right?

347
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:53,143
Now them Krauts make a push,
you use your grenade.

348
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:55,405
Okay, how do I know
if they're makin' a push?

349
00:24:57,317 --> 00:24:59,114
You hear a whole bunch
of shootin' and screamin',

350
00:24:59,252 --> 00:25:00,617
and a bunch of guys runnin' at ya...

351
00:25:00,954 --> 00:25:02,478
Yeah?

352
00:25:03,057 --> 00:25:05,252
Then you know they're makin' a push.

353
00:25:06,527 --> 00:25:07,687
Oh, yeah.

354
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,696
Oh, yeah, you wanna light up
a cigarette at night,

355
00:25:11,832 --> 00:25:13,129
lay on your back at the bottom
of the hole.

356
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:13,926
I don't smoke.

357
00:25:14,069 --> 00:25:14,831
Huh?

358
00:25:14,970 --> 00:25:16,232
I don't smoke.

359
00:25:17,838 --> 00:25:19,328
You still got your issues?

360
00:25:19,508 --> 00:25:20,668
Yeah?

361
00:25:20,842 --> 00:25:21,968
You will.

362
00:25:29,786 --> 00:25:31,151
What's your name?

363
00:25:31,621 --> 00:25:33,054
Warren.

364
00:25:33,723 --> 00:25:36,055
Welcome to Death Factory, Warren.

365
00:27:36,557 --> 00:27:39,424
You got point.
I've got you on a straight line course.

366
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:42,222
I know this is your first patrol.

367
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:44,724
You've had time
to watch what I've been doin'.

368
00:27:44,866 --> 00:27:45,958
Yeah.

369
00:27:46,501 --> 00:27:48,025
Be alert.

370
00:27:48,235 --> 00:27:51,204
You've been behind Kraut lines
for the last thirty yards or so.

371
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:53,195
You got no friends here.

372
00:27:53,641 --> 00:27:56,542
Our job is to scout the enemy positions

373
00:27:59,515 --> 00:28:02,678
Ease up on the trigger finger.

374
00:28:03,284 --> 00:28:04,308
Yeah, right.

375
00:28:04,452 --> 00:28:06,079
This is your first big chance
to stay alive,

376
00:28:06,222 --> 00:28:07,689
don't fuck it up.

377
00:28:09,024 --> 00:28:10,548
Let's go.

378
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:02,010
Slow down, Sandy, slow down.

379
00:29:04,485 --> 00:29:05,850
Slow down.

380
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:07,817
Sandy!

381
00:29:29,611 --> 00:29:30,168
What's goin' on?

382
00:29:30,313 --> 00:29:31,371
I lost Sandy!

383
00:29:39,656 --> 00:29:40,953
Get down, get down!

384
00:29:48,632 --> 00:29:49,860
What's goin' on?

385
00:29:50,068 --> 00:29:51,057
We lost Sanderson.

386
00:29:51,202 --> 00:29:52,032
What's this ''we'' crap?

387
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:53,194
Shut up!

388
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:55,828
What do we do, Sarge?

389
00:29:55,974 --> 00:29:57,305
We wait.

390
00:29:58,776 --> 00:30:01,176
I hope he's got brains enough
to come straight back.

391
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:03,108
What if he doesn't know he's alone?

392
00:30:03,816 --> 00:30:05,113
He knows.

393
00:32:31,909 --> 00:32:33,706
All right, we're headin' back.

394
00:32:34,078 --> 00:32:35,568
We're just gonna leave him out here?

395
00:32:35,813 --> 00:32:37,906
Can't afford to risk the entire squad.

396
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:39,242
Yeah, but...

397
00:32:39,384 --> 00:32:40,544
What is your name?

398
00:32:41,286 --> 00:32:43,652
Doug...Despin.

399
00:32:44,289 --> 00:32:45,756
Well, Doug Despin,

400
00:32:45,892 --> 00:32:48,986
this is the second time
I'm tellin' you to shut up.

401
00:32:49,495 --> 00:32:51,019
You follow me?

402
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:53,959
Yeah. Then, let's go.

403
00:33:02,676 --> 00:33:04,143
Warren!

404
00:33:43,587 --> 00:33:47,455
Afternoon, gentlemen.
We're gonna make another push.

405
00:33:47,658 --> 00:33:49,455
The objective is to retake the town

406
00:33:49,593 --> 00:33:51,686
of Schmidt four miles east
of our present position.

407
00:33:51,896 --> 00:33:53,158
Not that that's a surprise.

408
00:33:53,631 --> 00:33:58,227
To get there, we have got to secure
the river crossing on the Kall trail.

409
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:01,232
Now we'll approach the river through
this part of the forest.

410
00:34:02,007 --> 00:34:05,170
Roy, your boys are gonna take
the Kall Trail again.

411
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:08,211
You have got to take
and hold Arbaley Bridge.

412
00:34:10,016 --> 00:34:11,313
Yes, sir.

413
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:15,180
Now G-2 said it'll be clear sailing up
to the bridge but once you get there...

414
00:34:15,955 --> 00:34:17,786
it's gonna get pretty hot.

415
00:34:17,957 --> 00:34:19,049
With all due respect, sir,

416
00:34:19,192 --> 00:34:20,216
did G-2 forget about the tanks

417
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,089
the jerries
have been clobbering us with?

418
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:24,823
No. The artillery's gonna take care
of the tanks.

419
00:34:25,032 --> 00:34:26,499
They've been saying that for a week.

420
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:29,726
Well, they're saying it again,
and this time they're right.

421
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:30,359
Bunch of chickenshits...

422
00:34:30,504 --> 00:34:31,232
Do you have a problem, Captain?

423
00:34:31,372 --> 00:34:33,363
What if those tanks
are still firing, sir?

424
00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:35,367
Then we'll deal with it.

425
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,838
No problem.

426
00:34:37,212 --> 00:34:38,236
Captain Pritchett,

427
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,644
if you feel you're unable
to carry out your orders, you let know.

428
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:44,077
And I'll relieve you of your command
and find someboyd who can.

429
00:34:47,122 --> 00:34:49,215
Now the jumpingoff point's
the Siegfried line here,

430
00:34:49,358 --> 00:34:50,416
here and here.

431
00:34:50,559 --> 00:34:52,151
There's not gonna be
an opening barrage this time,

432
00:34:52,295 --> 00:34:53,592
I want surprise.

433
00:34:54,430 --> 00:34:57,024
You men will take
and hold your objectives.

434
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,834
We've been screwing
around too damn long up here.

435
00:35:00,103 --> 00:35:01,627
Any questions?

436
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:07,742
Any questions, Captain?

437
00:35:08,212 --> 00:35:09,736
No, sir.

438
00:35:10,381 --> 00:35:11,575
Thank you.

439
00:35:12,583 --> 00:35:13,880
Good day, gentlemen.

440
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:46,051
Hey, Sandy, you gonna eat that?

441
00:35:47,788 --> 00:35:49,278
Leave it alone!

442
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:52,256
You want more, you go wait in line.

443
00:35:55,029 --> 00:35:56,792
Sanderson, eat your food!

444
00:35:57,232 --> 00:35:58,494
I'm not hungry.

445
00:35:59,601 --> 00:36:01,068
That's not the point.

446
00:36:01,737 --> 00:36:03,295
I'm not hungry.

447
00:36:12,048 --> 00:36:14,414
Last time I had
a hot mealwas five days ago.

448
00:36:15,585 --> 00:36:18,179
Since then,
my entire platoon has been wiped out.

449
00:36:19,655 --> 00:36:21,088
That's why you're here.

450
00:36:21,959 --> 00:36:24,223
You're just a bunch of guys
in line to get shot,

451
00:36:24,428 --> 00:36:26,589
so they can bring in a bunch
of other guys.

452
00:36:27,297 --> 00:36:29,026
See how that works?

453
00:36:30,768 --> 00:36:32,895
Now, once you get
that through your fuckin' head,

454
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:36,034
maybe you'll realize how important
a hot meal could be.

455
00:36:39,677 --> 00:36:41,406
Don't go anywhere.

456
00:36:45,284 --> 00:36:47,275
Stay where I can find you,
we're makin' a push.

457
00:36:47,420 --> 00:36:49,388
We get orders, Sarge?

458
00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:51,147
We will.

459
00:36:51,991 --> 00:36:54,323
Well, if we didn't get orders,
how do you know we're makin' a push?

460
00:36:56,529 --> 00:37:02,900
Hot food, coffee, cigarettes.
We're making a push, sure as shit.

461
00:37:11,012 --> 00:37:12,877
He's full of it!

462
00:37:14,749 --> 00:37:16,910
Do you think he's full of it?

463
00:37:21,123 --> 00:37:22,590
He's full of it!

464
00:37:24,193 --> 00:37:26,127
When'd you start smokin'?

465
00:37:26,662 --> 00:37:27,924
What's it to you?

466
00:37:28,130 --> 00:37:29,529
Sorry I blew up.

467
00:37:30,833 --> 00:37:31,663
Shut up.

468
00:37:31,801 --> 00:37:33,029
Come on, Baxter, relax.

469
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:35,763
Last night for me.
I bet you lit up, Warren.

470
00:37:37,274 --> 00:37:38,332
My first day.

471
00:37:38,475 --> 00:37:39,100
Me, too.

472
00:37:39,242 --> 00:37:40,800
I was freezing.

473
00:37:43,247 --> 00:37:46,739
Hey...check this out.

474
00:37:46,884 --> 00:37:48,112
What the fuck you doin', Lonnie?

475
00:37:48,886 --> 00:37:51,719
You fart, I'm gonna blow your ass off.

476
00:37:56,328 --> 00:37:58,091
Only assholes smoke.

477
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:03,165
Cigarette?

478
00:38:08,207 --> 00:38:10,368
Problem with these issues,
they taste like shit.

479
00:38:15,849 --> 00:38:17,510
Hey, Sanderson.

480
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:25,554
Out there in the woods with the Krauts,
what was it like?

481
00:38:30,298 --> 00:38:36,134
It wsa like...drowning.

482
00:38:44,979 --> 00:38:46,537
You wanted to speak to me?

483
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:49,448
lieutenant?!

484
00:38:54,190 --> 00:38:57,591
I wanna know what happened out
on that patrol yesterday.

485
00:38:59,763 --> 00:39:03,563
I heard your point man got separated
from the squad.

486
00:39:03,701 --> 00:39:04,725
They're still learning.

487
00:39:04,869 --> 00:39:06,131
No shit.

488
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:09,364
What the fuck are you thinkin'
putting replaccment at point

489
00:39:09,507 --> 00:39:10,940
on his first patrol?!

490
00:39:11,075 --> 00:39:12,736
I've got nothing but replacements.

491
00:39:12,877 --> 00:39:15,243
You shoulda stayed at point, Sergeant.

492
00:39:16,747 --> 00:39:18,612
Sergeant!

493
00:39:19,885 --> 00:39:22,854
I thought it would be a perfect chance
for at least one

494
00:39:22,988 --> 00:39:24,421
of them to get some experience.

495
00:39:24,557 --> 00:39:25,546
Bullshit!

496
00:39:25,691 --> 00:39:27,659
You're still trying
to save your own ass!

497
00:39:27,793 --> 00:39:29,454
These kids don't know anything!

498
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:30,923
And you do?

499
00:39:31,798 --> 00:39:35,564
No. I don't.

500
00:39:36,937 --> 00:39:38,268
For four days...

501
00:39:38,404 --> 00:39:41,805
I've been watching
these mangled bodies being carried out

502
00:39:41,942 --> 00:39:42,601
of the woods,

503
00:39:42,743 --> 00:39:46,873
knowing real soon I'm gonna be expected
to lead a platoon in there.

504
00:39:47,114 --> 00:39:48,911
Nobody's telling me a goddammed thing.

505
00:39:49,049 --> 00:39:51,517
I just walk around,
trying to look like a lieutcnant,

506
00:39:51,653 --> 00:39:52,915
so, you're right.

507
00:39:53,153 --> 00:39:54,711
I don't know anything.

508
00:39:54,923 --> 00:39:56,083
In fact,

509
00:39:56,491 --> 00:40:01,087
the only one in this platoon
who does...is you.

510
00:40:03,064 --> 00:40:06,966
Do you get it now?
Is it starting to sink in?

511
00:40:08,104 --> 00:40:09,503
What do you want?

512
00:40:09,705 --> 00:40:12,572
I want your help!

513
00:40:15,911 --> 00:40:20,905
Look, if I can help you in any way
without endangering my own life,

514
00:40:21,151 --> 00:40:22,516
I won't hesitate.

515
00:40:22,753 --> 00:40:25,153
If you want my opinion,
I'll give it to ya.

516
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,789
But I'm not takin' a bullet for anybody

517
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:30,358
that's not good enough.

518
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,118
That's as good as it gets.

519
00:40:40,738 --> 00:40:42,330
I'll tell ya what, Dave.

520
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:45,042
You find yourself out there
in the middle of a fire fight...

521
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:48,440
with your guts hangin' out,
screamin' for a medic.

522
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:52,880
If I can help you in any way
without endangering my own life,

523
00:40:53,385 --> 00:40:54,943
I won't hesitate.

524
00:41:03,863 --> 00:41:05,262
So What do ya think?

525
00:41:06,834 --> 00:41:08,267
About what?

526
00:41:09,603 --> 00:41:13,767
this push that Manning's talking about.
You think we're really gonna do it?

527
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:15,435
Yeah.

528
00:41:19,147 --> 00:41:20,705
We just got here.

529
00:41:21,149 --> 00:41:23,014
Yeah.

530
00:41:27,255 --> 00:41:34,855
Hey, Sandy...Yesterday out in the woods
Manning was just gonna leave you there.

531
00:41:42,873 --> 00:41:44,841
I think we're all gonna die out here.

532
00:42:10,703 --> 00:42:17,006
Lord of my salvation,
that saves me...for He is my shiedld.

533
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:27,679
Saves me from my enemies
and iniquities...

534
00:42:28,089 --> 00:42:28,851
We'll go in two minutes.

535
00:42:29,323 --> 00:42:30,255
Sure.

536
00:42:35,329 --> 00:42:36,591
Two minutes

537
00:42:42,670 --> 00:42:43,728
Two minutes

538
00:42:47,342 --> 00:42:50,243
Two minutes, and nobody dies.

539
00:42:52,115 --> 00:42:54,140
Two minutes. Nobody dies.

540
00:42:56,686 --> 00:42:59,416
Two minutes. Nobody dies.

541
00:42:59,556 --> 00:43:01,854
Say it, Lonnie, you gotta say it!

542
00:43:01,991 --> 00:43:02,889
Nobody dies.

543
00:43:03,027 --> 00:43:04,392
Nobody dies.

544
00:43:05,796 --> 00:43:07,229
Nobody dies.
