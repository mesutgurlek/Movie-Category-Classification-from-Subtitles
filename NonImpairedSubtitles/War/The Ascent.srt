Stay calm!

13
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:36,118
Rybak! You too!

14
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:39,089
Get to cover!
Everyone into the woods!

15
00:02:39,192 --> 00:02:42,355
Into the woods!
Pick her up!

23
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:28,737
I'll cover you!

24
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,452
Move out!

25
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:17,545
I can't —

26
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,486
Rest.

27
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,702
Just a moment. Just a moment, dear.

28
00:04:35,808 --> 00:04:38,208
We'll get you something to drink,
something to eat.

29
00:04:43,416 --> 00:04:44,644
Krotsky —

30
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,086
What?

31
00:04:47,186 --> 00:04:48,653
Get it out.

32
00:04:52,025 --> 00:04:52,992
Get what out?

33
00:04:53,092 --> 00:04:55,219
Whatever there is left to eat.

34
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:20,936
Well, that was good going.

35
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,083
So where are the sleds?

36
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,947
<i>We should move on.</i>
<i>Then we'll be okay.</i>

37
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:37,185
We need to get out of here
and find something to eat.

38
00:06:37,697 --> 00:06:39,255
Then you'll be the one to get it.

39
00:06:41,033 --> 00:06:43,524
We have to stay here a while.

40
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:46,100
You know the Kurgaev farm?

41
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:48,771
Kurgaev? I do.

42
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,172
<i>He's got a woman there.</i>

43
00:06:51,344 --> 00:06:53,369
Hey, you. Watch it.

44
00:06:53,479 --> 00:06:55,208
Make a run over there. Be quick.

45
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,343
This is us.

46
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,055
Here's Dubovoi's camp.

47
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,818
- What about the wounded?
- And the children?

48
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:08,291
The families need to be delivered safely.

49
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,259
And without food, you yourself know —

50
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:13,056
It's still a long ways to Dubovoi.

51
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:15,591
A long way to go.

52
00:07:15,701 --> 00:07:17,191
How about finding a boar?

53
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,135
We could feed everyone.

54
00:07:19,238 --> 00:07:20,500
Pack up.

55
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:21,538
What, alone?

56
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:23,370
Take someone with you.

57
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:25,740
Stoptsov.

58
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:27,979
What kind of help could I be?

59
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:29,172
Right.

60
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,808
Matyushenko.
- They're calling you.

61
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:34,716
What's going on there?

62
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,185
This weapon's jammed.

63
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,118
But I could go.
Whatever you say.

64
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:42,353
No. Fix it so it shoots by morning.

65
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,429
Fine.

66
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:48,600
Is your weapon in order, Artillery?

67
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:49,668
All in order.

68
00:07:52,004 --> 00:07:53,130
Kolya!

69
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:54,706
Say hi to Zosya!

70
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,361
Eat some snow. It helps.

71
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:07,277
Damn! Won't go away.

72
00:09:09,315 --> 00:09:10,782
Can't do anything about it.

73
00:09:11,517 --> 00:09:14,315
Why didn't you stay?
Someone else could've come.

74
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,212
Who?

75
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,991
We're in deep now.

76
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:25,990
Used up the last of the ammo
on some patrollers.

77
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,798
Doesn't matter.
Once we get to Dubovoi, we'll have plenty.

78
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:39,876
You shoot pretty good.

79
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,273
Good eye.

80
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,574
Are you really from the artillery?
- Really.

81
00:09:47,987 --> 00:09:49,955
A regular soldier then.

82
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:51,387
Not quite.

83
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,482
How's that?

84
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,185
I taught math.

85
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:59,565
I graduated from the teacher's college
in Vitebsk.

86
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:02,099
Math? That's good.

87
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:08,472
Walk in my footsteps.
It'll be easier.

88
00:10:13,312 --> 00:10:15,371
I've been meaning to visit her
for a while now —

89
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:17,142
- Who?
- Zosya.

90
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:19,877
My Zosya's there. She's terrific.

91
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:21,476
You've got girls on your mind.

92
00:10:21,587 --> 00:10:23,680
Why not? It's not all just about war.

93
00:10:26,993 --> 00:10:28,221
No, it's not like that.

94
00:10:28,327 --> 00:10:32,286
Zosya and her folks are like family to me.

95
00:10:32,398 --> 00:10:34,889
They hid me when I was wounded,
and with the Germans all about.

96
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,491
You were surrounded?

97
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,093
They saved me, didn't give me away.

98
00:10:39,205 --> 00:10:42,606
They knew who they were hiding —
a company commander, after all.

99
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:45,704
A regular soldier.

100
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:49,579
When we were parting,
Kurgaev gave me his short fur coat.

101
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:53,441
Then they sent me off to the partisans
as if I were their own son.

102
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:57,514
Are you kidding?
No hard feelings at all.

103
00:10:57,623 --> 00:11:00,251
Even though they knew
about Zosya and me.

104
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,855
You know,
she came to me on her own.

105
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,132
I wasn't even thinking about it.

106
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,757
I was sleeping.

107
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,302
And in the morning,
I hear someone breathing heavily.

108
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,336
I felt heat sweeping all over me.

109
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:22,103
Damn. I would've married right away
if it wasn't for the war.

110
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:27,282
Is it still a long way?

111
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,747
We're getting close already.

112
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:36,891
See what I mean?
Talking makes the road shorter.

113
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,759
I don't know about you

114
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:46,702
but I can't stand
these lone assignments.

115
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,330
Even the easiest ones.

116
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:53,071
I'd rather make a hundred attacks,
as long as I'm in the ranks.

117
00:11:53,179 --> 00:11:56,205
But at night, the forest —
It's hard, you know.

118
00:11:57,249 --> 00:11:58,341
Maybe —

119
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:15,091
Maybe they... had time to get out.

120
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:20,622
Tell you what. Go on back.

121
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:24,894
I'll go on
another couple of kilometers.

122
00:13:25,604 --> 00:13:28,095
Can't go back empty-handed.

123
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:27,096
What the hell?
I said I'd go alone.

124
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:33,135
You'll freeze without a hat.
- Hats don't grow in the woods.

125
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,341
In the village, every man has a hat.

126
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,842
So I should snatch it
from someone, you say?

127
00:14:38,944 --> 00:14:42,607
Snatch it?
There's always a way to talk to people.

128
00:14:43,449 --> 00:14:44,746
You just need to know how.

129
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:53,215
Here. It's warmer than nothing.
- No, don't.

130
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:56,393
Cut it out. Don't be fussy.

131
00:14:56,662 --> 00:14:58,186
It's nice and warm.

132
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,603
Want some?

133
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,255
Go ahead, eat.

134
00:15:29,228 --> 00:15:31,093
Actually, thanks for not leaving.

135
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:35,228
When there are two —

136
00:15:37,703 --> 00:15:39,637
Well, let's move on.

137
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:51,347
Where is this damn village?

138
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,259
Are you the headman?

139
00:16:03,128 --> 00:16:04,095
Well?

140
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:09,032
Anyone else here?

141
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,431
Just us.

142
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:12,961
Any Germans in the village?

143
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:16,337
Germans? No.
There's only a policeman left behind.

144
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:17,409
Got a cow?

145
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,539
Yes.

146
00:16:23,682 --> 00:16:24,876
So far.

147
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,880
You should eat something.
I've got something hot here.

148
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,512
Fine, but make it quick.

149
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,857
So you work for the Germans.

150
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,799
Do they pay much?

151
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:49,598
I haven't asked for anything,
and I haven't gotten anything.

152
00:16:49,908 --> 00:16:51,876
He's an old man.

153
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:54,036
He did a stupid thing.
- Keep quiet.

154
00:16:58,484 --> 00:16:59,917
Take your hat off.

155
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:16,499
- Your son?
- Our son. Our Tolya.

156
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:17,933
Is he with the police too?

157
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,996
No, for God's sake!
He's at the front.

158
00:17:22,107 --> 00:17:23,904
We don't know if he's alive or not.

159
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:28,673
Yeah.

160
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:32,812
You're a disgrace to your son.
You sold out.

161
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:37,687
Put your Bible down.

162
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,184
Well!

163
00:17:42,961 --> 00:17:44,861
Gripping like a —
Let's go.

164
00:17:44,963 --> 00:17:47,261
- Son. Son, dear —
- Keep quiet.

165
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,424
Move it.

166
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:50,399
- Our Father.
- Wait!

167
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,801
Don't! Have mercy on the fool!
Son, dear.

168
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:56,397
He's going to shoot him.

169
00:17:56,508 --> 00:17:58,408
You should've thought of that earlier.

170
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:01,707
You think he wanted to be
a German headman?

171
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:05,409
They threaten him every day.
Shouting.

172
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:07,041
Putting a gun to his head!

173
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:09,950
Son, dear, let me out.

174
00:18:10,355 --> 00:18:11,652
Let me see.

175
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:14,021
Let me see what's happening.

176
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:15,593
Son, dear —

177
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,331
Son! What are you —

178
00:18:27,906 --> 00:18:30,170
What's with you?
- Nothing.

179
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:31,970
You're sick with fever.

180
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,440
Your friend's calling you.

181
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:38,943
He's sick.

182
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:44,347
Here's some dry raspberries.
You can make tea someplace.

183
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,549
Something to drink.
- No, thanks.

184
00:18:46,658 --> 00:18:47,647
Why not?

185
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:54,863
Go on.

186
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,195
And shut the door.

187
00:18:58,504 --> 00:19:00,665
What, you're letting him go?

188
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:05,501
The hell with him.

189
00:20:21,353 --> 00:20:22,513
Sorry.

190
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:24,817
I'm no help today.

191
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,119
Why the hell did you come then?

192
00:20:29,461 --> 00:20:30,894
You asked already.

193
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,954
"Asked."

194
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,124
Those other two wouldn't come, and you —

195
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,103
Stop it! Stop it already!

196
00:20:50,749 --> 00:20:52,114
Where are we?

197
00:20:54,119 --> 00:20:56,212
I didn't notice.
Are we going the right way?

198
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,954
I think so.

199
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:22,173
Faster!

200
00:22:54,439 --> 00:22:55,929
So you want to take me alive.

201
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,471
Just a second.

202
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:04,039
Damn it.

203
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,847
There.

204
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,575
Now you won't take me.

205
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,175
Sotnikov.

206
00:24:40,979 --> 00:24:43,209
Where are you hit?
- In the leg.

207
00:25:12,911 --> 00:25:13,673
Let's go.

208
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:22,581
I can't.

209
00:25:26,124 --> 00:25:27,022
Come on.

210
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:30,288
Come on.

211
00:25:38,336 --> 00:25:39,325
What is it?

212
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:43,908
Come on.

213
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,861
Does it hurt?

214
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,325
What's with you? Help.

215
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:16,696
One moment.

216
00:27:18,503 --> 00:27:19,902
One moment.

217
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,473
Grab on.

218
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:32,237
This is the end of it.

219
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:16,687
Where to now?
It's all lake.

220
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,327
Wait here.

221
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,633
I'll look around.

222
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,863
Looks okay.

223
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,802
There's a cabin close by.
It looks empty.

224
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,001
Sotnikov, what's with you?

225
00:31:21,179 --> 00:31:23,340
You'll see.

226
00:31:25,116 --> 00:31:25,980
Maybe —

227
00:31:27,085 --> 00:31:28,575
I'll take you there.

228
00:31:30,355 --> 00:31:31,788
We'll get warm.

229
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,321
And then —

230
00:31:37,195 --> 00:31:38,560
I'll stay here.

231
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:41,355
Yeah. You know, that'll be better.

232
00:31:41,466 --> 00:31:43,696
I need to go. The boys are waiting.

233
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:51,637
I'm frozen.

234
00:31:54,212 --> 00:31:56,908
It's all right.

235
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,711
It's all right, brother.

236
00:31:59,817 --> 00:32:01,341
I'll come back for you.

237
00:32:03,721 --> 00:32:07,589
Then we'll move you.

238
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,054
I'll come back for you.

239
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:23,139
I'll really come back for you.

240
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:26,335
Kolya. Everything's fine.

241
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:34,081
I was only afraid to die
out in the open field.

242
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:39,321
In the night, alone like a dog.

243
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:42,649
In the woods, it's not frightening.

244
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:47,689
The main thing
is to get used to the thought:

245
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,192
Is this to be the end?

246
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,984
Go on in.

247
00:33:54,365 --> 00:33:55,730
Are you alone here?

248
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:58,702
Yeah.

249
00:34:00,972 --> 00:34:02,997
Where's your father?

250
00:34:03,107 --> 00:34:04,335
He's gone.

251
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:08,908
Your mother?

252
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:12,574
She works for old man Yemelyan,
earning money for food.

253
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:14,550
I see.

254
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:18,384
Any Germans in the village?

255
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,116
No.

256
00:34:20,224 --> 00:34:22,886
They came once and took our pig.

257
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:24,552
They took it away in a truck.

258
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,054
What's your mother's name?

259
00:34:27,165 --> 00:34:32,034
- Demchika.
- So you must be Demyan, then, right?

260
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:33,967
They also call Mama "Polgeniya."

261
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,241
Are you partisans too?

262
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,640
What do you need to know for?
You're just a kid.

263
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:47,151
Say, is there any hot water?

264
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,610
There is. Wait.

265
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,550
Bring us some.

266
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:58,759
Maybe you've got some food too?

267
00:34:58,863 --> 00:35:00,194
Mama boiled potatoes.

268
00:35:00,298 --> 00:35:01,560
Do you have any bread?

269
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:03,293
Leonik ate it all yesterday.

270
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:08,504
Here's some, a treat.

271
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:12,005
Thank you.

272
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:26,012
Scram!

273
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:35,731
That's Mama.

274
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,335
Mama! We've got partisans here!

275
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,248
Hello, ma'am.

276
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:06,825
What's this about?

277
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:09,832
We were waiting for you.

278
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,458
What for?

279
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:15,196
There's no bread. There's no butter.

280
00:36:15,306 --> 00:36:17,365
Galya, take Katya.

281
00:36:17,475 --> 00:36:19,875
No hens to lay eggs!

282
00:36:19,977 --> 00:36:22,878
We're being nice to you, woman,
and you're angry with us.

283
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:25,141
If I were angry with you,
you'd be out of here.

284
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:28,245
Galya, I said take Katya!
I'll punish you!

285
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,890
When's the last time you saw Dyomka?

286
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,430
How do you know about Dyomka?

287
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,499
We know him.

288
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,295
He's wounded.

289
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,786
The bullet's still inside him.
We'll have to get it out.

290
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,378
Forget it. You can't get it out.

291
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:08,185
They say there was crying
over by Lesiny all night.

292
00:37:08,926 --> 00:37:10,791
They say a German got shot.

293
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,089
Who says?

294
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:14,394
The old women always talk.

295
00:37:14,865 --> 00:37:18,198
The old women?
The old women know everything.

296
00:37:18,636 --> 00:37:20,263
Get out of there.

297
00:37:24,308 --> 00:37:26,299
All right. That's that.

298
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:31,774
But now what?

299
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:35,209
That's the question.

300
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:40,257
How should I know
what you should do?

301
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:44,122
You see?

302
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:49,991
He can't walk. That's for sure.

303
00:37:54,972 --> 00:37:56,269
You got here, didn't you?

304
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,143
Quit it, Rybak. Let's go.

305
00:38:06,317 --> 00:38:07,375
Hold on!

306
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:09,351
Germans.

307
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:19,953
They're heading this way.

308
00:38:30,341 --> 00:38:32,502
In the attic! In the attic!

309
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:34,768
In the attic! Go!

310
00:39:04,775 --> 00:39:07,437
Hello, Prava. How are things?

311
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,047
See any strangers?

312
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,913
Like I've got nothing better to do
than to look for strangers.

313
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,543
- Seen any or not?
- No.

314
00:39:18,456 --> 00:39:19,616
Invite your guests into the house.

315
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,056
They're inviting everyone to the cemetery,
and you call them "guests".

316
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,524
What did you say?

317
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:26,621
You're gonna get it.

318
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,666
Hurry up! Don't stand there.

319
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:35,664
Can't you see they're cold?

320
00:39:35,773 --> 00:39:37,138
Make up something to eat.

321
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:42,236
Who stole our pig?

322
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:44,405
You shameless bastard!

323
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,415
And you're a Red Army bitch!

324
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,145
Maggot!

325
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:50,880
German scum!

326
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:58,491
<i>Bitte,</i> come inside.

327
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:48,672
I tell you there's no one there!

328
00:40:54,985 --> 00:40:57,545
- Where's the ladder?
- We never had one.

329
00:41:03,093 --> 00:41:05,254
All right, if you don't want to —
Come here!

330
00:41:07,765 --> 00:41:10,791
Come here! Red bitch!
