1
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:45,801
WHEN DID IT ALL BEGIN?

2
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,334
IT IS SAID, "WHEN IMANA
CREATED THIS LAND,

3
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:57,801
HE GREW SO FOND OF IT, HE
RETURNED EVERY NIGHT TO REST.

4
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:06,200
WHEN DID PARADISE
BECOME HELL?

5
00:03:11,434 --> 00:03:14,400
FROM THE START,
EVEN THE CONQUEST

6
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:16,767
WAS A REGRETTABLE
MISUNDERSTANDING.

7
00:03:31,667 --> 00:03:34,300
EUROPE GAVE THE LAND
TO ITS CONQUEROR,

8
00:03:34,367 --> 00:03:36,734
AND THE KING KNEW
NOTHING OF IT.

9
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,601
IT WAS NEVER ABOUT
CIVILIZATION,

10
00:03:43,734 --> 00:03:46,434
NEVER ABOUT TRIBE
OR RACE.

11
00:03:49,934 --> 00:03:52,734
IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT
GREED,

12
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:55,334
ARROGANCE AND POWER.

13
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:59,868
AND WHEN WE FINALLY
GRASPED THE HORROR,

14
00:04:01,767 --> 00:04:03,434
IT WAS TOO LATE.

15
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:15,367
From Kibuye in the west

16
00:04:15,434 --> 00:04:18,200
to Kibungo in the east,

17
00:04:18,267 --> 00:04:21,100
people gathered
seeking refuge

18
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:23,133
in churches
by the thousands,

19
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,567
in hospitals and schools.

20
00:04:25,634 --> 00:04:27,534
And when they were found,

21
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:30,033
the old and the sick,
women and children alike,

22
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,033
they were killed.

23
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,934
Killed because their identity
card said they were Tutsi.

24
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,400
Or because they had
a Tutsi parent.

25
00:04:38,467 --> 00:04:41,067
Or because someone thought
they looked like a Tutsi.

26
00:04:41,133 --> 00:04:43,534
Or slain like
thousands of Hutus

27
00:04:43,601 --> 00:04:46,033
because they
protected Tutsis

28
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,601
or would not
countenance a policy

29
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:50,901
that sought
to wipe out people

30
00:04:50,968 --> 00:04:52,901
who just the day before,

31
00:04:52,968 --> 00:04:56,067
and for years before, had been
their friends and neighbors.

32
00:04:56,133 --> 00:04:58,534
It is important
that the world know

33
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:03,167
that these killings were not
spontaneous or accidental.

34
00:05:03,234 --> 00:05:05,968
It is not an
African phenomenon

35
00:05:06,033 --> 00:05:07,968
and must never
be viewed as such.

36
00:05:08,033 --> 00:05:10,467
We have seen it
in industrialized Europe.

37
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:12,901
We have seen it in Asia.

38
00:05:12,968 --> 00:05:15,234
We must have
global vigilance

39
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:18,300
and never again
must we be shy

40
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:20,567
in the face
of the evidence.

41
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,167
OKAY, I'M SURE SOME OF YOU
HAVE QUESTIONS.

42
00:05:57,634 --> 00:05:59,534
YES, VENANCIA?

43
00:05:59,601 --> 00:06:02,734
MR. AUGUSTIN, WEREN'T YOU IN
THE ARMY BEFORE THE GENOCIDE?

44
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:07,601
COULD IT HAVE BEEN STOPPED,
ALL THE DYING?

45
00:06:07,667 --> 00:06:11,400
THAT'S THE PAST. THOSE
BAD THINGS ARE IN THE PAST.

46
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:14,434
MAYBE IF SOME
OF US WERE MORE COURAGEOUS.

47
00:06:14,501 --> 00:06:18,100
MAYBE IF THE WORLD
HAD PAID MORE ATTENTION.

48
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:20,834
I DON'T KNOW.

49
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:25,200
YES, ALBERT?

50
00:06:25,267 --> 00:06:27,133
WHAT KIND OF SOLDIER
WERE YOU?

51
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,033
A VERY BAD ONE.

52
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,100
I'M SORRY, VENANCIA.

53
00:06:39,334 --> 00:06:41,300
I DIDN'T ANSWER
YOUR QUESTION.

54
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,734
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE
WE COULD HAVE DONE.

55
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:53,534
OKAY.

56
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:50,033
YES, IT'S APRIL AGAIN.

57
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:55,367
EVERY YEAR IN APRIL
THE RAINY SEASON STARTS.

58
00:07:57,067 --> 00:07:59,667
AND EVERY YEAR,
EVERY DAY IN APRIL,

59
00:07:59,734 --> 00:08:04,467
A HAUNTING EMPTINESS
DESCENDS OVER OUR HEARTS.

60
00:08:08,734 --> 00:08:12,400
EVERY YEAR IN APRIL

61
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:15,300
I REMEMBER HOW
QUICKLY LIFE ENDS.

62
00:08:17,734 --> 00:08:20,434
EVERY YEAR
I REMEMBER HOW LUCKY

63
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,033
I SHOULD FEEL
TO BE ALIVE.

64
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,567
EVERY YEAR IN APRIL,

65
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:34,133
I REMEMBER.

66
00:09:19,534 --> 00:09:21,534
"MY DEAR BROTHER,

67
00:09:21,601 --> 00:09:23,534
THE RAINS ARE HERE.

68
00:09:23,601 --> 00:09:26,167
IT IS APRIL AGAIN.

69
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:28,567
HOW MANY YEARS
SINCE WE HAVE SPOKEN?

70
00:09:30,234 --> 00:09:33,701
FROM MY PRISON, I AM WRITING
YOU THIS LONG DUE LETTER.

71
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:40,634
I DON'T EXPECT
PITY OR LOVE.

72
00:09:40,701 --> 00:09:43,467
I KNOW THAT DESPITE ALL
THE GRIEF IN YOUR LIFE,

73
00:09:43,534 --> 00:09:46,334
YOU HAVE FOUND
SOMETHING TO LIVE FOR.

74
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:50,567
IT WAS NOT SUPPOSED
TO HAPPEN THIS WAY...

75
00:09:50,634 --> 00:09:53,334
THE WAR,
THE KILLINGS.

76
00:09:58,334 --> 00:10:02,367
WHEN I FINALLY REALIZED THAT
I WAS AN ACTOR IN THIS TRAGEDY,

77
00:10:02,434 --> 00:10:05,501
I CHOSE NOT
TO LIVE WITH THAT.

78
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:08,467
I THOUGHT MY DEATH
WOULD BRING ME PEACE.

79
00:10:08,534 --> 00:10:10,767
I WAS WRONG.

80
00:10:10,834 --> 00:10:12,868
ONLY THE TRUTH
CAN EASE MY GUILT.

81
00:10:15,234 --> 00:10:17,167
DEAR AUGUSTIN,

82
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:20,334
I MUST TELL YOU WHAT HAPPENED
TO JEANNE AND THE CHILDREN.

83
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:23,434
COME TO TANZANIA.

84
00:10:23,501 --> 00:10:26,167
DON'T WRITE ME BACK.
JUST COME.

85
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:29,100
YOUR BROTHER,
HONORE."

86
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,467
AUGUSTIN,
YOU SHOULD GO.

87
00:10:33,534 --> 00:10:35,467
NO.

88
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:37,467
IT'S OVER.

89
00:10:37,534 --> 00:10:39,634
WHAT'S THE POINT?

90
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:42,434
- HE'S YOUR BROTHER.
- HE'S NOTHING TO ME.

91
00:10:45,634 --> 00:10:47,801
I JUST WANT TO TAKE
CARE OF YOU.

92
00:10:47,868 --> 00:10:50,400
- OH, REALLY?
- YES.

93
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:53,701
SO, WHERE IS MY
WEDDING RING?

94
00:10:53,767 --> 00:10:56,801
OH!

95
00:10:56,868 --> 00:10:58,801
SO THAT'S IT, HUH?

96
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:00,868
I SEE YOU
STILL HAVE YOURS.

97
00:11:05,767 --> 00:11:07,767
YOU KNOW I CAN'T.

98
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,000
JEANNE IS...

99
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:14,501
WHAT?

100
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:18,734
STOP.

101
00:11:22,534 --> 00:11:24,634
YOU STILL CAN'T
SAY IT, CAN YOU?

102
00:11:28,901 --> 00:11:30,901
YOU MUST GO.

103
00:11:32,501 --> 00:11:34,367
NOT JUST FOR HONORE,

104
00:11:34,434 --> 00:11:36,434
BUT FOR YOU.

105
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:44,133
MR. BUTERA, YOU WERE ARRESTED

106
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,200
IN MAY, 1997 FOR THE CRIME

107
00:11:46,267 --> 00:11:48,868
OF INCITING VIOLENCE
WITH YOUR RADIO PROGRAM.

108
00:11:48,934 --> 00:11:51,434
AT THE TIME, YOU ENTERED
A NOT-GUILTY PLEA.

109
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:53,834
TODAY YOU WISH
TO CHANGE THAT PLEA?

110
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,133
YES.

111
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,133
I NOW RECOGNIZE
THAT THE RADIO PROGRAMS

112
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,300
I DID FOR RTLM
WERE CRIMINAL

113
00:12:01,367 --> 00:12:03,267
AND THAT MANY PEOPLE
WERE KILLED FOR IT.

114
00:12:03,334 --> 00:12:07,200
YOU WERE NOT AWARE OF WHAT
YOU WERE DOING IN APRIL, 1994?

115
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:09,767
NO, NOT AT THAT TIME.

116
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:12,000
COULD YOU
EXPLAIN TO THIS TRIBUNAL

117
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,968
THE REASON
FOR YOUR TURNABOUT?

118
00:12:14,033 --> 00:12:15,701
I HAVE HAD A LOT OF TIME

119
00:12:15,767 --> 00:12:17,567
TO THINK ABOUT MY GUILT
HERE IN PRISON

120
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:19,567
SURROUNDED
BY OTHER RWANDANS

121
00:12:19,634 --> 00:12:22,400
ACCUSED
OF THE SAME CRIME.

122
00:12:22,467 --> 00:12:24,501
I WAS UNDER
A LOT OF PRESSURE.

123
00:12:25,734 --> 00:12:27,667
PRESSURE FROM YOUR
CO-DETAINEES?

124
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:30,968
YES. PRESSURE
TO KEEP SILENT.

125
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:34,000
COULD YOU IDENTIFY
THESE INDIVIDUALS FOR US?

126
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:43,701
I PREFER NOT TO.
IT'S NOT IMPORTANT ANYMORE.

127
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:46,801
WHAT I WANT TO SAY
IS THAT IT TOOK TIME

128
00:12:46,868 --> 00:12:49,100
FOR ME TO REALIZE THAT WHAT
I HAVE BEEN ACCUSED OF

129
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:52,167
MAY HAVE BEEN TRUE AND THAT
WHAT I HAVE PARTICIPATED IN

130
00:12:52,234 --> 00:12:55,000
WAS GENOCIDE.

131
00:12:57,734 --> 00:12:59,868
SO YOU CAME TO ACCEPT
THE FACT OF YOUR GUILT?

132
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:04,634
YES, I BECAME AWARE
I WAS GUILTY.

133
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:07,167
BUT IT TOOK YOU TWO YEARS
TO FINALLY ADMIT THIS GUILT.

134
00:13:07,234 --> 00:13:10,467
- IS THIS CORRECT?
- YES,

135
00:13:10,534 --> 00:13:12,467
THAT IS CORRECT.

136
00:13:12,534 --> 00:13:15,801
WE'LL HAVE TO MAKE
SURE THAT...

137
00:13:15,868 --> 00:13:17,767
WE WILL STOP NOW

138
00:13:17,834 --> 00:13:20,868
AND RESUME AT 9:30 A.M.
ON MONDAY MORNING.

139
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:24,133
I REMIND THE DEFENDANT

140
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,133
THAT HE IS UNDER
A SOLEMN OATH OF SILENCE.

141
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,934
DO NOT DISCUSS YOUR
EVIDENCE WITH ANYONE.

142
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,167
- I WANT TO RETURN
BEFORE WE GO ON...

143
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:42,534
KIGALI, ARE YOU IN THE HOUSE?

144
00:13:43,734 --> 00:13:45,734
COME ON,
LET ME HEAR IT!

145
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:49,701
AND NOW, OUR STAR
SPEAKER IS HERE.

146
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:52,534
COMING TO YOU LIVE
IS MR. HONORE BUTERA,

147
00:13:52,601 --> 00:13:56,167
HERE TO GIVE US ANOTHER OF
HIS POPULAR HISTORICAL REVIEWS.

148
00:13:56,234 --> 00:13:59,100
EXCLUSIVELY FOR
RADIO MILLE COLLINES.

149
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,901
BEFORE I PASS THE MIC
PEOPLE, REMEMBER,

150
00:14:01,968 --> 00:14:04,367
- A COCKROACH CANNOT GIVE BIRTH...
- HEY.

151
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:06,367
TO A BUTTERFLY.

152
00:14:06,434 --> 00:14:09,501
A COCKROACH WILL ALWAYS GIVE
BIRTH TO COCKROACHES 162Habyarimana

153
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:11,501
BE VIGILANT.

154
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:14,834
THEY'RE AMONG US,
THOSE INYENZI.

155
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:17,400
THE DEVILS.
OYE, OYE.

156
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,234
YEGO, YEGO, YEGO.

157
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:28,334
AS ALWAYS,
SPEAKING THE TRUTH.

158
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,734
OYE, OYE, OYE.

159
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:33,667
NOW, MY DEAR LISTENERS...

160
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:39,200
YESTERDAY, WE SPOKE
ABOUT HOW THE BAZUNGU,

161
00:14:39,267 --> 00:14:41,200
THE GERMAN AND BELGIAN
COLONISTS,

162
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:44,934
CHOSE THE TUTSI INVADERS AS
PROXIES FOR THEIR DIRTY JOBS.

163
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,934
FORCED LABOR,

164
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:49,267
RAISING OF HEAVY TAXES
ON THOSE POOR PEASANTS

165
00:14:49,334 --> 00:14:51,267
AND THE WHIPPING.

166
00:14:51,334 --> 00:14:54,300
We Hutu, will we ever
forget the whipping?

167
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:56,300
Will we,
my dear listeners?

168
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:59,100
I think not, for these
scars will never heal.

169
00:14:59,167 --> 00:15:02,234
But the days when
a Tutsi King Umwami

170
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,133
is imposed upon
Hutus is passed.

171
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,501
For we have sworn never to
let them rule over us again.

172
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:10,767
- Never.

173
00:15:10,834 --> 00:15:12,734
Stay tuned,
my dear listeners

174
00:15:12,801 --> 00:15:14,767
for some more music
from Radio Sympa,

175
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:19,234
Power 106FM,
RTLM, Kigali.

176
00:16:02,267 --> 00:16:04,400
HEY, NOT LIKE THAT.

177
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:11,300
CIVIL FORCES
MY FOOT, EH?

178
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,734
IF THE R.P.F. COME
FROM THE HILLS,

179
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:16,067
THEY'RE GOING TO KILL
THESE GUYS. HEY!

180
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:18,067
I DON'T BELIEVE
WE ARE TRAINING

181
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:20,567
THESE INTERAHAMWE
TO FIGHT REBELS.

182
00:16:27,534 --> 00:16:29,467
I HAVE HEARD RUMORS.

183
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:31,467
THERE ARE ASSASSINATIONS,

184
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:34,400
SMALL MASSACRES HERE
AND THERE IN THE PROVINCES.

185
00:16:35,868 --> 00:16:37,767
THINGS ARE ACCELERATING.

186
00:16:37,834 --> 00:16:39,801
THAT'S ALL THEY ARE...

187
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:42,133
RUMORS.

188
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
YOU THINK THIS IS A REHEARSAL?

189
00:16:44,267 --> 00:16:48,000
THESE OFFICIALS ARE HERE
FOR THE DAMNED SHOW, MAN.

190
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,501
HEY, NOT WITH A MACHETE!

191
00:17:01,334 --> 00:17:03,367
GIVE ME THIS.

192
00:17:04,567 --> 00:17:06,434
THAT'S IT FOR TODAY,
CAPTAIN.

193
00:17:06,501 --> 00:17:09,033
VALIANT MEMBERS
OF THE CIVIL DEFENSE FORCE,

194
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,834
GIVE ME YOUR WEAPONS.
SOLDIER!

195
00:17:11,834 --> 00:17:13,767
CAPTAIN MUGANZA,

196
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,734
GIVE THESE
TO THE CHIEF FOR ME.

197
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:19,534
- WHICH CHIEF?
- COLONEL BAGOSORA.

198
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:22,234
- WHAT IS IT?
- LISTS.

199
00:17:46,734 --> 00:17:48,767
THESE ARE EXECUTION LISTS.

200
00:17:55,667 --> 00:17:57,634
IT'S NAMES AND ADDRESSES.

201
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:01,601
TRAITORS.
THAT'S WHAT HE CALLED THEM.

202
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:04,267
THERE ARE LISTS COMING
FROM ALL DISTRICTS.

203
00:18:05,701 --> 00:18:07,634
IT'S TUTSIS.

204
00:18:07,701 --> 00:18:09,601
BUT IT'S ALSO HUTUS.

205
00:18:09,667 --> 00:18:12,501
THERE ARE DOCTORS
ON THAT LIST,

206
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:15,133
PROFESSORS
ON THAT LIST.

207
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,133
ANYBODY THAT MIGHT
NOT BOW DOWN

208
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,167
TO HUTU POWER
IS ON THAT LIST!

209
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,801
TEACHERS, TEACHERS
ARE REGISTERING

210
00:18:22,868 --> 00:18:24,901
THEIR STUDENTS
BY ETHNICITY.

211
00:18:48,734 --> 00:18:50,667
WHAT ARE YOU
TWO PLOTTING?

212
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:53,133
NOTHING. XAVIER
WAS JUST LEAVING.

213
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,100
COME ON, HAVE
A BEER WITH US.

214
00:18:55,167 --> 00:18:56,934
- THE SOCCER MATCH IS ON.
- I CAN'T.

215
00:18:57,033 --> 00:18:58,834
I HAVE
AN APPOINTMENT.

216
00:18:58,901 --> 00:19:01,434
TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF.

217
00:19:01,501 --> 00:19:03,534
BYE, JEANNE.

218
00:19:03,601 --> 00:19:06,601
- PLEASE TELL FELICIE TO COME TO VISIT US. SIBYO?
- YEAH.

219
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,601
AUGUSTIN, WHAT'S
GOING ON?

220
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:10,667
MOM.

221
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,968
HELLO.

222
00:19:16,033 --> 00:19:17,634
- MOM!
- HMM?

223
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:19,534
YVES-ANDRE WAS SAYING
BAD WORDS AGAIN.

224
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:22,234
IT'S NOT TRUE, MOM, I SWEAR.
I WAS JUST TELLING HIM A JOKE.

225
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,934
HE'S LYING.
HE SAID FUCK.

226
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,167
MARCUS, PLEASE.
I HEAR THAT ALL DAY.

227
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
IT'S HAPPENING,
ISN'T IT?

228
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,133
I KNEW I SHOULDN'T
HAVE LISTENED TO YOU.

229
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:43,701
WE SHOULD HAVE GONE A LONG
TIME AGO TO KENYA OR SENEGAL.

230
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,734
I DON'T KNOW, BUT...

231
00:19:45,801 --> 00:19:47,801
I'M IN THE MILITARY.

232
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,634
THIS IS OUR HOME.

233
00:19:51,701 --> 00:19:53,634
SURE, BUT TELL ME

234
00:19:53,701 --> 00:19:55,634
HOW CAN I CALL
THIS HOME

235
00:19:55,701 --> 00:19:57,868
WHEN I'M LIVING IN
CONSTANT FEAR, AUGUSTIN?

236
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:05,868
I LOST ALREADY MOST
OF MY FAMILY IN '92.

237
00:20:05,934 --> 00:20:09,434
- IT'S ONLY US NOW.
- I CAN'T JUST GET UP AND RUN!

238
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:13,100
- ABANDON EVERYTHING, WHAT? - WE SHOULD
HAVE BROUGHT ANNE-MARIE BACK SOONER.

239
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:15,567
ANNE-MARIE IS SAFER IN
THE COUNTRYSIDE THAN HERE.

240
00:20:15,634 --> 00:20:18,033
COME ON, WAKE UP!

241
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,834
NOBODY'S SAFE
IN THIS COUNTRY.

242
00:20:24,701 --> 00:20:26,767
YOU HAVE SEEN THE BAHUTU
TEN COMMANDMENTS?

243
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:32,734
SOMEBODY PUT IT
ON MY DESK

244
00:20:32,801 --> 00:20:34,801
TODAY AT THE HOSPITAL.

245
00:20:37,801 --> 00:20:40,667
THEY EVEN UNDERLINED
NUMBER SEVEN.

246
00:20:41,701 --> 00:20:44,133
"THE RWANDESE ARMED FORCES

247
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,901
SHOULD BE EXCLUSIVELY HUTU.

248
00:20:45,968 --> 00:20:48,634
NO MEMBER OF MILITARY

249
00:20:48,701 --> 00:20:51,234
SHALL MARRY A TUTSI."

250
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,400
JEANNE.

251
00:21:15,701 --> 00:21:18,501
JEANNE.

252
00:21:27,267 --> 00:21:29,801
NOW I'M TALKING ABOUT
OUR CHILDREN'S LIVES.

253
00:21:33,067 --> 00:21:35,834
IF ANYTHING HAPPENS,
THEY WILL LET US ALL DIE.

254
00:21:35,901 --> 00:21:37,701
OKAY, JEANNE.

255
00:21:37,767 --> 00:21:40,334
JUST LET ME FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.

256
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,400
FOR NOW, WHY DON'T YOU CALL
ANNE-MARIE AND TELL HER TO GET READY?

257
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:46,334
- UNCLE!
- HEY, MARCUS!

258
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,467
THIS IS YOUR BROTHER. I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD FOR IT TODAY.

259
00:21:52,534 --> 00:21:55,834
AUGUSTIN, IT'S A SMALL
COUNTRY AND PEOPLE TALK.

260
00:21:55,901 --> 00:21:57,834
SO NOW YOU THINK I
HAVE JOINED THE REBELS?

261
00:21:57,901 --> 00:22:00,767
OF COURSE NOT. BUT YOU MUST
HAVE SAID OR DONE SOMETHING.

262
00:22:00,834 --> 00:22:02,534
I AM DOING WHAT
I HAVE ALWAYS DONE.

263
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:05,033
THAT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH. YOU
NEED TO BE ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

264
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,033
AND WHAT SIDE IS THAT?!

265
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,033
HSST!

266
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,033
"HUTU POWER OVER ALL"?

267
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,400
YOUR PEOPLE WILL DRAG
THIS COUNTRY OVER THE EDGE.

268
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,701
SO YOU THINK THE ARUSHA AGREEMENTS
WILL SOLVE ALL OUR PROBLEMS.

269
00:22:18,767 --> 00:22:22,100
- IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?
- IF THE ARUSHA AGREEMENTS GO INTO EFFECT

270
00:22:22,167 --> 00:22:25,667
I WILL PROBABLY LOSE MY JOB TO A
TUTSI. SO EITHER WAY I AM SCREWED.

271
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:30,434
THAT IS WHY WE ARE
AGAINST THE AGREEMENT.

272
00:22:30,501 --> 00:22:32,400
SO THAT HARD-WORKING
HUTUS LIKE YOURSELF

273
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:34,267
DO NOT HAVE TO STAND
ASIDE FOR ANYBODY.

274
00:22:34,334 --> 00:22:37,467
NO, FOR YOU IT'S ABOUT
POWER! GAINING POWER.

275
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,133
AUGUSTIN,

276
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,167
THE AGREEMENTS ARE DEAD.

277
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:52,801
THE PRESIDENT HAS MADE TOO MANY
CONCESSIONS UNDER FOREIGN PRESSURE.

278
00:22:54,434 --> 00:22:56,367
IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO KNOW, MY DEAR BROTHER,

279
00:22:56,434 --> 00:23:00,133
- THIS IS A FATAL MISTAKE.
- HONORE...

280
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:02,100
ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT A COUP?

281
00:23:02,167 --> 00:23:04,434
AUGUSTIN, THIS IS WAR.

282
00:23:04,501 --> 00:23:06,868
LISTEN, LITTLE BROTHER.

283
00:23:06,934 --> 00:23:08,901
EVEN WARS HAVE RULES.

284
00:23:08,968 --> 00:23:13,100
WE CANNOT JUSTIFY THE
SLAUGHTERING OF INNOCENT PEOPLE.

285
00:23:13,167 --> 00:23:16,200
YOUR EXTREMIST FRIENDS WILL
DRAG THIS COUNTRY INTO HELL.

286
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,434
THANKS TO THE SUPPORT
OF OUR FRENCH FRIENDS,

287
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,901
WE HAVE KALASHNIKOVS
FROM ALBANIA,

288
00:23:24,968 --> 00:23:27,334
ISRAEL UZIS,

289
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,300
CZECH GRENADES,

290
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,667
M-16 RIFLES
FROM THE U.S.A.,

291
00:23:31,734 --> 00:23:33,734
GUNS AND AMMO
FROM EGYPT.

292
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:39,367
CAPTAIN MUGANZA,
GIVE ME A HAND, PLEASE.

293
00:23:55,234 --> 00:23:57,868
- MACHETES?
- MACHETES, CAPTAIN.

294
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,934
FROM CHINA.

295
00:24:02,267 --> 00:24:04,200
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

296
00:24:04,267 --> 00:24:06,300
- IT'S NOT ON OUR MANIFEST.
- SO WHAT?

297
00:24:06,367 --> 00:24:09,467
THEY'RE HERE AND WE HAVE
PLENTY OF FARMERS OUT THERE

298
00:24:09,534 --> 00:24:11,467
WHO NEED TO GO TO WORK.

299
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,100
OUR PEOPLE NEED
TO GO TO WORK.

300
00:24:17,434 --> 00:24:19,367
CAPTAIN...

301
00:24:19,434 --> 00:24:22,000
MON COLONEL.

302
00:24:26,534 --> 00:24:28,801
OUR PRESIDENT HAS BECOME SOFT

303
00:24:28,868 --> 00:24:31,467
PLAYING THE GAME
OF THE INYENZI!

304
00:24:31,534 --> 00:24:33,534
THE AGREEMENTS
WILL BE OUR DEATH!

305
00:24:35,634 --> 00:24:37,534
THEY CALL US HUTU POWER,
EXTREMISTS

306
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,100
BECAUSE WE WON'T
ACCEPT THEIR DICTATES?

307
00:24:42,968 --> 00:24:44,968
SO BE IT!
POWER!

308
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,234
Tension is mounting
in Rwanda despite the presence...

309
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,567
There are
signs that the ceasefire

310
00:24:54,634 --> 00:24:56,968
between the existing Hutu
government of Rwanda

311
00:24:57,033 --> 00:24:59,033
and the mostly
Tutsi rebel forces

312
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:03,000
of the Rwandan Patriotic Front,
or R.P.F., is about to fail.

313
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:06,133
Special envoy,
Assistant Secretary of State

314
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,634
Prudence Bushnell, traveled
to Rwanda two weeks ago

315
00:25:08,701 --> 00:25:11,234
in a last effort to bring
President Habyarimana

316
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:14,400
to implement the agreements.
an agreement they say,

317
00:25:14,467 --> 00:25:17,801
gives too much power
to the Tutsis and the R.P.F.

318
00:25:17,868 --> 00:25:20,767
This may also well be
the last chance for peace.

319
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:29,167
AND SO...

320
00:25:29,234 --> 00:25:31,534
BEDTIME.

321
00:25:35,701 --> 00:25:37,634
ALL RIGHT, COME ON,
BOYS, LIGHTS OUT.

322
00:25:37,701 --> 00:25:40,234
MOM?

323
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,701
WHY DO THEY CALL
US COCKROACHES?

324
00:25:47,834 --> 00:25:50,100
'CAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW
ANY BETTER, SWEETHEART.

325
00:25:59,634 --> 00:26:02,534
DAD, WHAT ARE WE?

326
00:26:02,601 --> 00:26:06,234
- HUTU OR TUTSI?
- DON'T YOU KNOW ANYTHING?

327
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,200
PAPA'S A HUTU.
MOM'S A TUTSI.

328
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:11,801
IT'S OKAY, YVES-ANDRE.
HE CAN ASK.

329
00:26:12,934 --> 00:26:14,601
I AM A HUTU,

330
00:26:14,667 --> 00:26:17,534
SO YOU ARE A HUTU.

331
00:26:17,601 --> 00:26:19,801
IN OUR TRADITION,
THE FATHER'S ORIGIN DECIDES.

332
00:26:19,868 --> 00:26:21,767
SO WHEN I GROW UP,

333
00:26:21,834 --> 00:26:24,000
MY I.D. CARD
WILL SAY HUTU?

334
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:26,834
YES, BUT ONE DAY,

335
00:26:26,901 --> 00:26:29,501
I HOPE IT WILL JUST
SAY RWANDAN.

336
00:26:31,534 --> 00:26:33,634
OKAY, BEDTIME.

337
00:26:33,701 --> 00:26:35,534
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

338
00:26:36,501 --> 00:26:39,167
SWEET DREAMS.

339
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:43,334
I CAN'T SEE ANYTHING.

340
00:27:44,868 --> 00:27:46,601
AUGUSTIN.

341
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:51,701
THEY'VE JUST ANNOUNCED THAT THE
PRESIDENT'S PLANE WAS SHOT DOWN.

342
00:28:12,834 --> 00:28:14,801
PACK A FEW THINGS
FOR THE KIDS.

343
00:28:14,868 --> 00:28:17,234
WE HAVE TO LEAVE
KIGALI TONIGHT.

344
00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:43,300
We ask all
Rwandese people

345
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:46,267
not to sucmb to this
terrible tragedy.

346
00:28:46,334 --> 00:28:48,968
We ask the armed forces
to stay vigilant

347
00:28:49,033 --> 00:28:51,200
- and ensure
security for all.

348
00:29:23,467 --> 00:29:25,367
AUGUSTIN,

349
00:29:25,434 --> 00:29:27,467
I CAN'T GET ANNE-MARIE
ON THE PHONE.

350
00:29:29,534 --> 00:29:31,701
KEEP TRYING.

351
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:50,300
- WHO'S THERE?
- IT'S ME, XAVIER.

352
00:29:54,968 --> 00:29:56,901
AUGUSTIN,
IT'S TERRIBLE.

353
00:29:56,968 --> 00:30:00,000
THEY'RE SHOOTING EVERYBODY.
THERE'S DEAD PEOPLE IN THE STREET.

354
00:30:00,067 --> 00:30:02,501
- FELICIE AND I WERE
PICKING UP SOME FOOD

355
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:05,968
FROM LANDO'S RESTAURANT
WHEN WE HEARD THE EXPLOSION.

356
00:30:06,033 --> 00:30:08,901
THEY ARE GOING HOUSE BY HOUSE
PULLING PEOPLE OUT.

357
00:30:08,968 --> 00:30:12,367
- AUGUSTIN, LET'S GO.
- NO. THERE ARE ROADBLOCKS ALL OVER.

358
00:30:12,434 --> 00:30:15,801
- WE LEAVE, WE WALK INTO THE MOUTH OF THE LION.
- WHERE DO YOU THINK WE ARE?

359
00:30:15,868 --> 00:30:17,467
WE CAN'T GET TRAPPED
IN KIGALI!

360
00:30:17,534 --> 00:30:19,234
AT LEAST THE U.N.
IS HERE. MAYBE...

361
00:30:21,267 --> 00:30:23,467
- WE'RE SITTING IN THE MIDDLE.
- OKAY, GO! GO.

362
00:30:34,567 --> 00:30:36,601
MR. VILBUR,
MY WIFE AND CHILDREN

363
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,634
WOULD FEEL SO MUCH SAFER
IN YOUR HOUSE.

364
00:30:38,701 --> 00:30:41,567
I WOULD BE RISKING THE
LIVES OF MY OWN FAMILY.

365
00:30:41,634 --> 00:30:45,501
- I MUST ASK YOU TO LEAVE.
- MR. VILBUR, PLEASE.

366
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:47,634
JUST ONE NIGHT.

367
00:30:47,701 --> 00:30:50,567
NO.

368
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,234
AT LEAST...

369
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,300
AT LEAST TAKE THE WOMEN
AND THE CHILDREN.

370
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:08,901
JUST THE WOMEN
AND CHILDREN.

371
00:31:08,968 --> 00:31:10,968
ONE NIGHT.

372
00:31:25,601 --> 00:31:28,501
THIS IS ALL YOU HAVE?

373
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:30,501
HELLO?

374
00:31:30,567 --> 00:31:32,667
YES, YOU MUST HELP ME.

375
00:31:32,734 --> 00:31:34,701
IT'S THE FIFTH TIME
I'VE CALLED.

376
00:31:34,767 --> 00:31:36,434
I MUST REACH ANNE-MARIE.

377
00:31:36,501 --> 00:31:38,434
YES, I'M HER FATHER.

378
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:42,067
THEN CAN I SPEAK
TO THE HEAD PRIEST?

379
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:44,100
Sorry, I can't help you.

380
00:31:50,567 --> 00:31:52,634
THEY HUNG UP.

381
00:31:52,701 --> 00:31:55,901
Kurt Cobain's body was
found inside a garage apartment

382
00:31:55,968 --> 00:31:57,968
adjacent to his
Seattle home,

383
00:31:58,033 --> 00:32:00,934
dead of an apparently
self-inflicted shotgun wound.

384
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,968
...gave back to
back homeruns in the 6th inning

385
00:32:04,033 --> 00:32:06,934
to turn a one-run deficit
into a one-run lead.

386
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,868
...Wednesday's sharp gains.

387
00:32:08,934 --> 00:32:11,200
Dow Jones Industrial
average closed up...

388
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:13,467
- LIONEL, THANKS FOR COMING. I'M SORRY.
- SURE.

389
00:32:13,534 --> 00:32:16,801
WHAT ARE YOU GETTING THROUGH YOUR
CHANNELS? OUR INTEL IS PRACTICALLY NIL.

390
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:19,434
WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
EITHER. IT'S NIGHT OVER THERE,

391
00:32:19,501 --> 00:32:21,267
SO NO ONE KNOWS WHAT'S
REALLY GOING ON.

392
00:32:21,334 --> 00:32:23,534
ALL WE KNOW FOR SURE IS
THAT A PLANE WAS SHOT DOWN

393
00:32:23,601 --> 00:32:25,367
AND THE PRESIDENT
OF RWANDA IS DEAD.

394
00:32:25,434 --> 00:32:28,467
SO IS THE PRESIDENT OF BURUNDI
WHO WAS ALONG FOR THE RIDE.

395
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:30,634
WHAT'S YOUR BEST GUESS AS TO
WHO SHOT THE PLANE DOWN?

396
00:32:30,701 --> 00:32:34,567
COULD BE ANYBODY, REALLY. REBELS,
HUTU EXTREMISTS, FRENCH MERCENARIES.

397
00:32:34,634 --> 00:32:37,701
BUT THE PRESIDENTIAL GUARD WON'T
LET ANYBODY NEAR THE CRASH SITE.

398
00:32:37,767 --> 00:32:39,767
WELL, THEY'RE PROBABLY
THE ONES WHO SHOT IT.

399
00:32:39,834 --> 00:32:41,801
This is NBC Nightly News

400
00:32:41,868 --> 00:32:44,767
reported by Brian Williams.

401
00:32:44,834 --> 00:32:47,534
Good evening. Fighting
is going on tonight

402
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:50,067
in the small African
nation of Rwanda,

403
00:32:50,133 --> 00:32:51,968
and there
is growing concern

404
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:54,934
about getting the Americans and
other foreigners there out...

405
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,400
Killings and looting
have been reported

406
00:32:57,467 --> 00:32:59,434
following a suspicious
plane crash...

407
00:32:59,501 --> 00:33:02,801
...government ministers opposed to
the late president have been kidnapped.

408
00:33:02,868 --> 00:33:06,133
...that both the United Nations and
the press keep well away from their war.

409
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,334
Which leaves the U.N.
in an impossible position.

410
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:11,501
WE ARE TAKING OVER
THE PRIME MINISTER'S SECURITY.

411
00:33:11,567 --> 00:33:14,434
- FIVE MEN DOWN!
- WE WILL ESCORT YOU BACK TO U.N. HEADQUARTERS.

412
00:33:14,501 --> 00:33:16,901
OUT OF THE QUESTION. I NEED TO
TALK TO THE COMMANDING OFFICER.

413
00:33:16,968 --> 00:33:20,234
I AM THE COMMANDING OFFICER! PUT
DOWN YOUR GUNS OR WE FINISH YOU.

414
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,400
WE'VE GOT FIVE MEN DOWN.
I REPEAT, FIVE MEN DOWN.

415
00:33:22,467 --> 00:33:24,234
WE DON'T KNOW WHERE
THEY'RE GOING TO TAKE US.

416
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:26,267
WE NEED REINFORCEMENTS NOW!

417
00:33:26,334 --> 00:33:28,267
AM I CLEAR ENOUGH?

418
00:33:28,334 --> 00:33:30,667
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND?
WE'RE GONNA BE LYNCHED!

419
00:33:30,734 --> 00:33:32,734
OVER!

420
00:34:01,467 --> 00:34:03,467
WE KNOW THE PRIME MINISTER
IS HERE!

421
00:34:24,701 --> 00:34:26,701
HERE I AM.

422
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:40,467
COME WITH US, MADAME.

423
00:34:40,534 --> 00:34:42,400
TAKE ME TO YOUR
COMMANDING OFFICER.

424
00:34:42,467 --> 00:34:45,200
BUT PLEASE, LEAVE MY
CHILDREN IN PEACE.

425
00:34:46,267 --> 00:34:48,667
CUT THE BULLSHIT!

426
00:35:16,434 --> 00:35:18,434
IT'S HERE, I'M TELLING YOU #82.

427
00:35:32,434 --> 00:35:34,367
WHO IS IT?

428
00:35:34,434 --> 00:35:36,767
- CAPTAIN MUGANZA?
- WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

429
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,634
GOOD MORNING, CAPTAIN. WE'RE
SECURING THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

430
00:35:39,701 --> 00:35:42,634
- THIS NEIGHBORHOOD IS SECURE.
- OF COURSE.

431
00:35:42,701 --> 00:35:45,534
WOULD YOU OPEN THE GATE? IF YOU
WOULD JUST SHOW US YOUR I.D. CARD

432
00:35:45,601 --> 00:35:48,434
AND THE CARDS OF EVERYONE IN
THE HOUSE, WE WILL BE ON OUR WAY.

433
00:35:55,501 --> 00:35:57,434
I JUST HAVE MY
SERVICE PASS.

434
00:35:57,501 --> 00:35:59,467
THIS WON'T DO, CAPTAIN.

435
00:35:59,534 --> 00:36:01,467
WE NEED TO SEE YOUR
NATIONAL I.D. CARD.

436
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,601
- WELL, LET ME JUST GO IN THE HOUSE...
- WAIT.

437
00:36:04,634 --> 00:36:06,667
SEARCH THE HOUSE.

438
00:36:28,834 --> 00:36:30,767
LISTEN, MUGANZA.

439
00:36:30,834 --> 00:36:32,834
YOU'RE FROM GITARAMA?

440
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:36,000
MY FATHER WAS
A BUSINESSMAN.

441
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,200
- A HUTU BUSINESSMAN.
- I KNOW.

442
00:36:40,367 --> 00:36:42,434
I WENT TO SCHOOL
WITH YOUR COUSIN FRANCOIS.

443
00:36:43,467 --> 00:36:45,200
AND I ALSO KNOW

444
00:36:45,267 --> 00:36:48,000
YOU MARRIED
A TUTSI WOMAN.

445
00:36:52,467 --> 00:36:55,567
YOU CAN KEEP PLAYING A DIRTY LITTLE
GAME FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

446
00:36:55,634 --> 00:36:57,567
BUT IF I COME BACK

447
00:36:57,634 --> 00:36:59,634
AND YOU'RE STILL HERE,

448
00:37:01,601 --> 00:37:03,601
I'LL HAVE NO CHOICE.

449
00:37:07,234 --> 00:37:09,167
LET'S GO.

450
00:37:09,234 --> 00:37:11,234
CHECK THE LIST AGAIN.

451
00:37:48,801 --> 00:37:50,801
THIS WAY.

452
00:38:16,334 --> 00:38:18,367
ANNE-MARIE?

453
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:21,400
ANNE-MARIE,
CAN YOU HEAR ME?

454
00:38:21,467 --> 00:38:23,234
YES, HOW ARE YOU, PAPA?

455
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,167
I AM FINE.

456
00:38:26,234 --> 00:38:29,367
- AND MAMA?
- SHE'S, UM, AT THE NEIGHBORS

457
00:38:29,434 --> 00:38:31,067
with your brothers.

458
00:38:31,133 --> 00:38:33,400
I'M SCARED.

459
00:38:33,467 --> 00:38:35,400
WE CAN HEAR THE GUNS.

460
00:38:35,467 --> 00:38:38,234
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
YOU ARE SAFE THERE.

461
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:40,167
YOU ARE IN
A CATHOLIC SCHOOL.

462
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,400
Nobody can go in there.

463
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:44,167
PAPA, I HAVE TO GO.

464
00:38:44,234 --> 00:38:47,200
- THE OTHER GIRLS ARE WAITING FOR THE PHONE.
- OKAY, OKAY.

465
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,033
YOU KNOW I LOVE YOU.

466
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:53,901
I LOVE YOU TOO, PAPA.

467
00:38:55,534 --> 00:38:57,901
- Bye.
- BYE BYE.

468
00:39:21,267 --> 00:39:23,200
GIRLS.

469
00:39:23,267 --> 00:39:25,167
YOU MUST CALM DOWN.

470
00:39:25,234 --> 00:39:27,734
PLEASE, ALL OF YOU,
GO TO YOUR DORMITORY.

471
00:39:27,801 --> 00:39:30,234
I NEED ALL OF YOU TO GO
TO YOUR DORMITORIES NOW.

472
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,267
PLEASE, QUICKLY.

473
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:34,234
- MARTINE...
- QUICKLY.

474
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:36,400
- I NEED TO SPEAK WITH YOU.
- I'M SORRY, FATHER.

475
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:38,434
WE HAVE A SCHOOL
FULL OF TERRIFIED GIRLS.

476
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:40,501
MARTINE.

477
00:39:43,868 --> 00:39:45,801
THIS IS A VERY
DIFFICULT SITUATION,

478
00:39:45,868 --> 00:39:48,534
BUT WE MUST DO OUR DUTY.

479
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:51,601
WE CANNOT HARBOR REBELS.

480
00:39:51,667 --> 00:39:53,667
- WE'LL HAVE TO HAND THEM OVER.
- FATHER!

481
00:39:53,734 --> 00:39:56,734
THESE ARE NOT REBELS.

482
00:39:56,801 --> 00:39:59,901
THESE ARE GIRLS. GIRLS YOU HAVE
BROUGHT UP AS YOUR OWN DAUGHTERS.

483
00:39:59,968 --> 00:40:03,067
- NOW YOU WOULD PUT THEM OUT?
- WHAT CAN I DO, MY CHILD?

484
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:05,834
WE CANNOT PROTECT
ALL OF THEM.

485
00:40:05,901 --> 00:40:09,167
I DO NOT HAVE THE POWER
TO CHANGE THIS SITUATION.

486
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,100
WE MUST PRAY.

487
00:40:21,167 --> 00:40:23,067
WE DO NOT WANT ANOTHER MOGADISHU.

488
00:40:23,133 --> 00:40:25,501
WE DON'T WANT OUR BOYS
DRAGGED NAKED IN THE STREETS.

489
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:27,968
CONGRESS WON'T HAVE IT.
THE PENTAGON WON'T HAVE IT.

490
00:40:28,033 --> 00:40:31,300
- THE PRESIDENT WON'T...
- SIR, WE'RE ONLY 48 HOURS INTO THIS

491
00:40:31,367 --> 00:40:35,033
AND WE ALREADY HAVE REPORTS OF OVER
10,000 WOMEN AND CHILDREN ALREADY KILLED.

492
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:38,434
THEY'RE NOT JUST KILLING TUTSIS,
THEY'RE TARGETING MODERATE HUTUS.

493
00:40:38,501 --> 00:40:40,734
PRUDENCE, WHAT IS OUR
VITAL INTEREST IN RWANDA?

494
00:40:40,801 --> 00:40:43,667
IF THERE IS A CRISIS, IT COULD
DESTABILIZE THE ENTIRE REGION.

495
00:40:43,734 --> 00:40:45,234
MAY I?

496
00:40:46,334 --> 00:40:48,334
I APPRECIATE
THE HUMAN TRAGEDY.

497
00:40:49,834 --> 00:40:51,767
HERE. IF THE KILLING
IN RWANDA STARTS

498
00:40:51,834 --> 00:40:55,033
THE BEST-CASE SCENARIO
ESTIMATES 20,000 DEAD.

499
00:40:55,100 --> 00:40:57,767
THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO
COULD EXCEED 500,000.

500
00:40:57,834 --> 00:41:00,634
IT'S JANUARY 25th, 1994
C.I.A. REPORT.

501
00:41:00,701 --> 00:41:02,734
THAT'S JUST NINE
WEEKS AGO, SIR.

502
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:07,434
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT
ANY C.I.A. REPORT AGAIN.

503
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:09,767
SINCE THE CRASH
OF THE PRESIDENT'S PLANE

504
00:41:09,834 --> 00:41:13,400
THE SITUATION IN RWANDA HAS
VERY QUICKLY BECOME UNSTABLE.

505
00:41:13,467 --> 00:41:15,667
I JUST SPOKE
WITH THE AMBASSADOR,

506
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:17,667
AND HE REPORTS
THAT THE FIGHTING

507
00:41:17,734 --> 00:41:20,767
IS LARGELY BETWEEN
THE RWANDAN MILITARY FORCES

508
00:41:20,834 --> 00:41:22,634
AND THE RWANDAN
PATRIOTIC FRONT.

509
00:41:22,701 --> 00:41:25,834
HAVE ANY AMERICANS BEEN HURT
OR ARE THEY BEING TARGETED?

510
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:29,200
NO, AMERICANS ARE NOT
BEING TARGETED AT THIS TIME.

511
00:41:29,267 --> 00:41:31,200
AND CLEARLY, WE ARE
VERY CONCERNED

512
00:41:31,267 --> 00:41:34,634
WITH THE APPROXIMATELY 255
AMERICANS THAT ARE IN THE REGION.

513
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:37,901
WHAT ABOUT THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY? THE BELGIANS, THE FRENCH?

514
00:41:37,968 --> 00:41:40,701
- HOW MANY COULD YOU GET OUT?
- LET ME PUT THIS IN CONTEXT.

515
00:41:40,767 --> 00:41:42,534
THERE IS FIGHTING
AND THERE IS CHAOS.

516
00:41:42,601 --> 00:41:45,100
THERE IS NO DATE.
THERE'S NO TIME.

517
00:41:45,167 --> 00:41:48,934
WE ARE LOOKING INTO ENSURING THE
SAFETY OF ALL AMERICAN CITIZENS.

518
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,901
ARE YOU SATISFIED
WITH THE PROTECTION

519
00:41:50,968 --> 00:41:53,534
THE RWANDAN MILITARY IS GIVING
TO THE U.S. CITIZENS?

520
00:41:53,601 --> 00:41:57,434
AGAIN, THE RWANDAN MILITARY FORCES
ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF FIREFIGHTS

521
00:41:57,501 --> 00:42:00,200
WITH THE RWANDAN
PATRIOTIC FRONT OR THE R.P.F.

522
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:02,133
IT IS NOT HIGH ON THEIR
LIST OF PRIORITIES

523
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:04,534
TO TAKE CARE OF THE AMERICAN
CITIZENS AT THIS POINT.

524
00:42:06,634 --> 00:42:09,667
THE REBEL FORCES,
ARE THEY "TUTU" OR "HUTSI"?

525
00:42:09,734 --> 00:42:12,801
- HUTU AND TUTSI.
- WHICH ONES ARE THE GOOD GUYS?

526
00:42:51,767 --> 00:42:53,734
HELLO, IT'S ME.

527
00:42:53,801 --> 00:42:55,734
AUGUSTIN.

528
00:42:55,801 --> 00:42:57,701
CHRIST, I'VE BEEN
TRYING TO CALL YOU.

529
00:42:57,767 --> 00:43:00,267
THE LINES ARE JAMMED.
I CAN'T GET THROUGH.

530
00:43:00,334 --> 00:43:03,300
LISTEN, I NEED YOUR HELP.
I AM STUCK HERE WITH XAVIER.

531
00:43:03,367 --> 00:43:05,901
JEANNE AND THE KIDS ARE NEXT
DOOR WITH THE BELGIAN GUY.

532
00:43:05,968 --> 00:43:07,868
I need to get them
out of the city.

533
00:43:07,934 --> 00:43:10,634
YOU NEED TO WORRY ABOUT
YOURSELF, BROTHER.

534
00:43:11,868 --> 00:43:13,934
DO YOU KNOW THAT I FOUND
YOUR NAME ON THE LIST

535
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,067
as a Tutsi
sympathizer?

536
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:18,067
I buried it,

537
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:20,434
but it won't stay
that way for long.

538
00:43:20,501 --> 00:43:23,234
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY.
I'M SAVING YOUR NECK.

539
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,901
AND MY FAMILY?

540
00:43:24,968 --> 00:43:27,567
I AM YOUR FAMILY.

541
00:43:27,634 --> 00:43:29,868
Can't do no more.
I warned you.

542
00:43:29,934 --> 00:43:33,100
I KNOW. I KNOW.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

543
00:43:33,167 --> 00:43:35,934
DAMN RIGHT I WAS.

544
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,133
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT?

545
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:41,767
- TAKE CARE OF YOUR OWN TUTSIS, MAN.
- HONORE...

546
00:43:41,834 --> 00:43:43,767
LISTEN, I BEG YOU,

547
00:43:43,834 --> 00:43:46,100
TAKE MY FAMILY...
JEANNE...

548
00:43:46,167 --> 00:43:48,434
JEANNE AND THE BOYS
TO THE HOTEL MILLE COLLINES.

549
00:43:48,501 --> 00:43:50,000
THEY WILL BE PROTECTED.

550
00:43:50,067 --> 00:43:52,968
YOU CAN GET THROUGH THE
ROADBLOCKS. PEOPLE KNOW YOU.

551
00:43:58,634 --> 00:44:00,601
I DON'T LIKE IT.
I DON'T TRUST HIM.

552
00:44:00,667 --> 00:44:03,267
- WE'RE NOT EVEN SURE IF HE'S COMING.
- HE'S MY BROTHER.

553
00:44:07,601 --> 00:44:09,467
IF I CAN GET YOU
AND THE BOYS

554
00:44:09,534 --> 00:44:11,701
TO THE HOTEL MILLE COLLINES,
YOU WILL BE SAFE.

555
00:44:11,767 --> 00:44:14,367
AND ANNE-MARIE, WELL SHE
WILL BE SAFE AT HER SCHOOL.

556
00:44:14,434 --> 00:44:16,501
WE WILL ALL BE SAFE.

557
00:44:19,934 --> 00:44:21,767
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT ELSE WE CAN DO.

558
00:44:41,367 --> 00:44:44,167
- WHERE ARE THEY? WE NEED TO LEAVE NOW.
- BROTHER.

559
00:44:44,234 --> 00:44:47,467
LISTEN, THE GUARDS ARE GETTING
SERIOUSLY DRUNK AT THE ROADBLOCKS.

560
00:44:48,934 --> 00:44:51,501
- WHO IS THIS?
- FELICIE, XAVIER'S FIANCEE.

561
00:44:51,567 --> 00:44:54,968
- YOU SAID WIFE AND CHILDREN.
- SHE IS FAMILY.

562
00:44:55,033 --> 00:44:58,033
OH, I PRESUME
SHE'S A TUTSI, TOO.

563
00:44:58,100 --> 00:44:59,667
COME ON, BOYS, GET IN THE CAR.

564
00:44:59,734 --> 00:45:02,100
- I NEVER ASKED.
- WHAT?

565
00:45:05,901 --> 00:45:07,968
HONORE WON'T TAKE FELICIE.

566
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:13,767
- IF I'M A PROBLEM...
- EVERYBODY GOES.

567
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:17,834
- LISTEN, AUGUSTIN...
- FELICIE, GET IN THIS CAR.

568
00:45:28,868 --> 00:45:30,734
YOU TOO, AUGUSTIN.
LET'S GO.

569
00:45:30,801 --> 00:45:32,734
HONEY, I'M STAYING.

570
00:45:32,801 --> 00:45:35,434
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- I'M GOING TO JOIN YOU LATER.

571
00:45:35,501 --> 00:45:37,701
- WE HAVE TO GO.
- AUGUSTIN, GET IN THIS CAR.

572
00:45:37,767 --> 00:45:39,534
I CAN'T.

573
00:45:40,968 --> 00:45:43,367
AUGUSTIN, TELL HER.

574
00:45:43,434 --> 00:45:45,334
JEANNE, LISTEN TO ME.

575
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:48,067
- I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE WITHOUT...
- LISTEN TO ME.

576
00:45:48,133 --> 00:45:50,534
JEANNE, HIS NAME
WAS ON A LIST.

577
00:45:53,501 --> 00:45:55,934
- OH MY GOD.
- JEANNE. JEANNE...

578
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:57,968
- JEANNE.
- NO.

579
00:45:58,033 --> 00:46:00,167
- JEANNE, JEANNE, JEANNE, JEANNE.
- NO!

580
00:46:00,234 --> 00:46:02,167
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

581
00:46:02,234 --> 00:46:05,100
AUGUSTIN, THEY NEED
TO GO NOW.

582
00:46:05,167 --> 00:46:08,501
- PLEASE, AUGUSTIN.
- NO, NO, NO, YOU NEED TO GET BACK IN THE CAR.

583
00:46:10,033 --> 00:46:11,968
- IF SOMETHING HAPPENS...
- NO.

584
00:46:12,067 --> 00:46:14,567
IT'S GOING TO BE FINE.

585
00:46:14,634 --> 00:46:17,033
PAPA, WE DON'T WANT TO GO.

586
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:19,033
LOOK, GO BACK
IN THE CAR, EH?

587
00:46:19,100 --> 00:46:21,033
COME ON, DO IT.
DO IT!

588
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:22,834
AUGUSTIN, WE NEED TO GO.

589
00:46:25,133 --> 00:46:27,133
JEANNE.

590
00:46:30,334 --> 00:46:32,334
YOU NEED TO GET
IN THE CAR.

591
00:46:37,367 --> 00:46:39,367
COME ON, BOYS.
GET IN THE CAR.

592
00:46:44,434 --> 00:46:46,400
I KNOW, I KNOW.

593
00:47:29,334 --> 00:47:31,334
OKAY. GO.

594
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:39,868
OKAY.

595
00:47:39,934 --> 00:47:41,634
PAPA WILL BE FINE, EH?

596
00:47:41,701 --> 00:47:44,734
I'M A SOLDIER.

597
00:49:01,234 --> 00:49:04,734
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- WE DON'T TEMPT THE DEVIL.

598
00:49:07,501 --> 00:49:11,067
- I THOUGHT EVERYONE KNEW YOU.
- I AM NOT ALONE.

599
00:49:18,033 --> 00:49:20,167
- SHIT.
- WHAT?

600
00:49:20,234 --> 00:49:22,200
THAT WAS NOT THERE BEFORE.

601
00:49:33,300 --> 00:49:35,133
HEY, STOP THE CAR.

602
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:54,834
YES.

603
00:49:54,901 --> 00:49:56,767
I WORK FOR RADIO RTLM.

604
00:50:04,634 --> 00:50:06,634
HEY!

605
00:50:06,701 --> 00:50:08,601
YES?

606
00:50:26,701 --> 00:50:28,601
OH, I'M SO SILLY.
WE'RE JUST GOING

607
00:50:28,667 --> 00:50:30,667
TO THE SUPERMARKET
AND I LEFT THEM HOME.

608
00:50:30,734 --> 00:50:33,634
WE WERE IN SUCH A HURRY WITH
THE CHILDREN AND THE NEW CURFEW.

609
00:50:33,701 --> 00:50:35,901
LISTEN, BROTHER,
JUST GIVE US A BREAK?

610
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,868
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

611
00:50:42,934 --> 00:50:44,901
EVERYBODY OUT.

612
00:50:51,601 --> 00:50:53,534
LISTEN...

613
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:55,667
I AM A PARTY MEMBER.

614
00:50:55,734 --> 00:50:58,200
I AM AUTHORIZED TO TAKE THIS
WOMAN TO RUN SOME ERRANDS.

615
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:02,367
LISTEN, I... LET ME
CALL COLONEL SENTORE.

616
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,434
HE CAN SORT THIS OUT, OKAY?
CLEAR THIS UP.

617
00:51:04,501 --> 00:51:07,400
- THIS IS NOT GOOD.
- WHAT'S NOT GOOD, MOMMY?

618
00:51:07,467 --> 00:51:10,901
NOTHING, I JUST WANT
YOUR UNCLE TO HURRY UP.

619
00:51:15,367 --> 00:51:17,300
HEY, AMAKURU.

620
00:51:17,367 --> 00:51:19,300
THIS IS HONORE BUTERA.

621
00:51:19,367 --> 00:51:22,200
I'M HERE AT THE ROADBLOCK
ON RUE DE L'HOPITAL.

622
00:51:22,267 --> 00:51:24,767
NO, SIR. THEY WON'T LET ME PASS.

623
00:51:27,601 --> 00:51:29,601
YES, SIR.

624
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:34,968
YES, SIR.

625
00:51:41,534 --> 00:51:43,501
THEY ARE MY FAMILY.

626
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:50,734
YES, SIR.

627
00:51:50,801 --> 00:51:52,901
OF COURSE, SIR. YOU KNOW
I WORK FOR THE PARTY.

628
00:51:52,968 --> 00:51:55,234
OF COURSE.
FOR THE CAUSE, ALWAYS.

629
00:52:01,067 --> 00:52:03,000
HE WANTS
TO TALK TO YOU.

630
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,234
YES, SIR?
OKAY, SIR.

631
00:52:23,334 --> 00:52:25,234
OKAY,
LOCK THE DOORS!

632
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,133
OH MY GOD.

633
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,434
STAY DOWN!

634
00:52:32,501 --> 00:52:34,133
STOP IT.

635
00:53:00,234 --> 00:53:02,734
- NAME?
- AUGUSTIN MUGANZA.

636
00:53:02,801 --> 00:53:05,100
- NAME OF DETAINEE?
- BUTERA.

637
00:53:31,968 --> 00:53:33,968
HE'LL BE RIGHT
WITH YOU.

638
00:53:36,634 --> 00:53:38,534
- NO, I CAN'T.
- I'M SORRY?

639
00:53:38,601 --> 00:53:41,067
I THOUGHT THAT...

640
00:53:41,133 --> 00:53:43,501
- NO, I CAN'T.
- HE'S ON HIS WAY.

641
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:45,534
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL HIM YOURSELF?

642
00:53:45,601 --> 00:53:47,534
THE VISIT WOULD
DO HIM GOOD.

643
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:49,534
NO.

644
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:52,200
PLEASE TELL HIM I HAD
TO LEAVE ON EMERGENCY.

645
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,400
I'M SORRY.

646
00:56:02,868 --> 00:56:04,901
DAMN.

647
00:56:31,901 --> 00:56:33,901
YOU GET THAT THING
TO WORK?

648
00:56:35,601 --> 00:56:37,601
YEAH.

649
00:56:42,834 --> 00:56:44,834
SO WHAT'S WRONG?

650
00:56:48,601 --> 00:56:52,934
I SAW A MILITARY TRUCK
HEADING TO THE FRENCH SCHOOL.

651
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:54,968
THEY MUST BE
ROUNDING PEOPLE UP

652
00:56:55,033 --> 00:56:56,634
FOR AN EVACUATION
LIKE IN '92.

653
00:56:56,701 --> 00:56:58,601
I MEAN...

654
00:56:58,667 --> 00:57:02,200
IF WE CAN GET THERE,
WE HAVE A CHANCE.

655
00:57:02,267 --> 00:57:05,234
- THERE ARE TOO MANY ROADBLOCKS.
- NO, IT'S NOT THAT FAR.

656
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,067
IT'S A MILLION MILES,
AUGUSTIN.

657
00:57:08,901 --> 00:57:10,901
I SAY WE JUST LAY LOW.

658
00:57:12,234 --> 00:57:14,200
THIS...

659
00:57:14,267 --> 00:57:16,434
THING CAN'T
LAST FOREVER.

660
00:57:20,267 --> 00:57:22,200
SHE SAID YOUR NAME
ON THE RADIO.

661
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,033
YOU HEARD MY NAME
ON THE RADIO?

662
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,033
LOOK, WE CAN GET
THROUGH THE ROADBLOCKS.

663
00:57:54,033 --> 00:57:56,067
THEY'RE NOT TRAINED
SOLDIERS.

664
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:00,100
WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

665
00:58:55,033 --> 00:58:57,067
THE ROADBLOCK
ON THE LEFT.

666
00:58:58,734 --> 00:59:00,734
THEY SEEM DRUNKEST.

667
00:59:05,634 --> 00:59:07,634
SHALL WE?

668
00:59:10,601 --> 00:59:12,601
LET'S DO IT.

669
00:59:20,501 --> 00:59:22,501
LET'S PUSH IT.

670
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:24,367
- SHOOT ME!
- BACK OFF. YOU CANNOT GO!

671
01:00:24,434 --> 01:00:27,167
SHOOT ME! I DON'T WANT
TO DIE WITH THE MACHETE.

672
01:00:27,234 --> 01:00:29,100
PLEASE, SHOOT ME
WITH U.N. BULLET!

673
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:31,133
PLEASE! PLEASE!

674
01:00:38,467 --> 01:00:41,200
WHY? WHY CAN'T WE
GET IN THERE?

675
01:00:41,267 --> 01:00:43,167
PLEASE TAKE THE CHILDREN WITH YOU.

676
01:00:43,234 --> 01:00:45,667
WE HAVE...
WE HAVE ORDERS!

677
01:00:45,734 --> 01:00:47,801
TAKE THE CHILDREN
WITH YOU!

678
01:00:47,868 --> 01:00:49,901
PLEASE?!

679
01:01:06,567 --> 01:01:08,267
XAVIER!

680
01:01:12,901 --> 01:01:14,868
MOVE IT!
MOVE!

681
01:01:14,934 --> 01:01:17,634
GET IN THE CAR!

682
01:02:16,467 --> 01:02:18,834
- OUT OF THE CAR.
- WE'RE WITH THE CONVOY.

683
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:20,868
EVERYBY OUT!
EVERYBODY OUT!

684
01:02:20,934 --> 01:02:23,334
- SHOW ME YOUR PAPERS.
- HEY, HEY, HEY...

685
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:28,601
WE ARE WITH THE CONVOY.

686
01:02:28,667 --> 01:02:31,467
ASK THE OFFICER
AND HE WILL TELL YOU.

687
01:02:32,934 --> 01:02:35,801
MOVE THESE OBSTACLES AWAY.
WE HAVE TO GO.

688
01:02:35,868 --> 01:02:37,868
HEY LIEUTENANT!

689
01:02:41,567 --> 01:02:44,267
S'IL VOUS PLAIT,
LIEUTENANT.

690
01:02:44,334 --> 01:02:48,000
HE DOESN'T BELIEVE I AM WITH
YOU. WE ARE IN THE SAME CONVOY.

691
01:02:48,067 --> 01:02:50,300
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- IS HE WITH YOU?

692
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,467
- THE SAME CONVOY!
- SHUT UP...

693
01:02:54,534 --> 01:02:56,033
AND LET
THE WHITE MAN TALK.

694
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:04,400
- ARE THESE PEOPLE WITH YOU?
- OUR CONVOY IS THE JEEPS AND THE TRUCKS.

695
01:03:04,467 --> 01:03:06,434
I'M SORRY.
I'VE ORDERS...

696
01:03:06,501 --> 01:03:08,467
ONLY EXPATRIATES.

697
01:03:15,601 --> 01:03:18,334
GO! GO!
REMOVE THAT THING!

698
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:19,934
GO!

699
01:03:49,033 --> 01:03:51,033
XAVIER MUYANGO?

700
01:03:55,033 --> 01:03:57,601
WHO IS XAVIER MUYANGO?

701
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:01,100
I AM.

702
01:04:07,901 --> 01:04:09,901
AREN'T YOU THE TRAITOR

703
01:04:09,968 --> 01:04:12,567
XAVIER MUYANGO WE'VE HEARD
ABOUT ON THE RADIO?

704
01:04:16,234 --> 01:04:17,834
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU MEAN.

705
01:04:17,901 --> 01:04:19,834
MOVE OVER WITH THAT GROUP.

706
01:04:19,901 --> 01:04:22,601
EVERYBODY ELSE,
GET OFF. GET OFF!

707
01:04:22,667 --> 01:04:25,434
GET OVER, GET OVER!

708
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:31,167
WHAT'S WRONG
WITH YOU, EH?

709
01:04:31,234 --> 01:04:34,234
- MOVE OVER! FORGET SOMETHING?
- I CAN SPEAK FOR THIS MAN!

710
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:36,567
HE IS LOYAL.
HE IS A GOOD SOLDIER.

711
01:04:36,634 --> 01:04:38,634
THE ARMY IS FILLED
WITH TRAITORS.

712
01:04:38,701 --> 01:04:40,901
THEN I WILL TAKE HIM
TO THE HEADQUARTERS MYSELF.

713
01:04:40,968 --> 01:04:43,200
- I'LL TAKE...
- YOU WANT TO HELP?

714
01:04:43,267 --> 01:04:46,467
YOU WANT TO HELP?

715
01:04:46,534 --> 01:04:48,534
- GIVE HIM A MACHETE.
- NO.

716
01:04:58,901 --> 01:05:02,634
WE DON'T WASTE BULLETS
ON COCKROACH TRAITORS.

717
01:05:07,934 --> 01:05:09,501
AUGUSTIN,

718
01:05:35,801 --> 01:05:37,834
XAVIER... XAVIER...

719
01:05:39,901 --> 01:05:41,968
MUYANGO.

720
01:05:47,667 --> 01:05:50,000
MUYANGO,
STAND UP!

721
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:05,934
COME ON,
LET'S GO.

722
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,133
LET'S GO.
IT'S NOT GONNA HELP.

723
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:10,434
- SH... HEY, HEY! HEY!
- LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

724
01:06:13,334 --> 01:06:15,734
- HEY!
- IT'S NOT GONNA HELP. HE'S DEAD.

725
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:48,200
- OUl?
- Colonel Bagosora,

726
01:06:48,267 --> 01:06:50,334
THIS IS ASSISTANT
SECRETARY BUSHNELL.

727
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,834
MRS. BUSHNELL,
WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE.

728
01:06:52,901 --> 01:06:56,467
I REGRET WE DIDN'T MEET DURING
YOUR LAST VISIT IN KIGALI.

729
01:06:56,534 --> 01:06:58,634
SIR, I'M CALLING TO ADVISE YOU

730
01:06:58,701 --> 01:07:01,267
THAT WE VIEW THE SITUATION
VERY SERIOUSLY.

731
01:07:01,334 --> 01:07:03,534
PRESIDENT CLINTON
IS VERY CONCERNED.

732
01:07:03,601 --> 01:07:05,667
HOW KIND OF THE PRESIDENT
TO BE THINKING OF ME.

733
01:07:05,734 --> 01:07:09,167
WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS
THAT THERE HAS BEEN...

734
01:07:09,234 --> 01:07:12,601
THE U.N. REPORTS ARE VERY EXAGGERATED.
THERE HAS BEEN SOME TROUBLE.

735
01:07:12,667 --> 01:07:14,734
AND NATURALLY, WE HAVE
TO DEFEND OUR PEOPLE.

736
01:07:14,801 --> 01:07:18,567
YOU MUST TAKE ACTION TO
CHANGE THE COURSE OF EVENTS.

737
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,767
BUT IT'S THE REBELS,
THEY ATTACKED US.

738
01:07:20,834 --> 01:07:23,367
AND NOW THE PEOPLE HAVE
RISEN UP TO DEFEND THEMSELVES.

739
01:07:23,434 --> 01:07:26,367
COLONEL, WE KNOW WHO'S
PERPETRATING THESE KILLINGS.

740
01:07:26,434 --> 01:07:28,467
YOU CAN SEE ALL THE WAY
FROM WASHINGTON?

741
01:07:28,534 --> 01:07:30,300
MRS. BUSHNELL,

742
01:07:30,367 --> 01:07:33,100
IF THERE WAS A CSEFIRE WE
MIGHT BE ABLE TO DO SOMETHING,

743
01:07:33,167 --> 01:07:35,300
but now the situation
is very difficult.

744
01:07:35,367 --> 01:07:37,801
VERY DIFFICULT, MADAME.
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE.

745
01:07:37,868 --> 01:07:40,634
NO, YOU DO NOT NEED
A CEASEFIRE

746
01:07:40,701 --> 01:07:44,501
TO STOP THIS
HATE RADIO BROADCAST.

747
01:07:44,567 --> 01:07:46,501
MONSIEUR BAGOSORA,

748
01:07:46,567 --> 01:07:49,467
IF YOU DO NOT STOP THE KILLING,
THERE WILL BE CONSEQUENCES.

749
01:07:49,534 --> 01:07:51,467
REALLY?

750
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:53,300
YOU WILL SEND
THE MARINES?

751
01:07:53,367 --> 01:07:55,234
WE HAVE NO OIL HERE.
WE HAVE NO DIAMONDS.

752
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:57,834
WE HAVE NOTHING YOU NEED IN
RWANDA. WHY WOULD YOU COME?

753
01:07:57,901 --> 01:08:00,234
IF YOU DO NOT
CEASE THE KILLINGS,

754
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:02,000
I PROMISE YOU,

755
01:08:02,067 --> 01:08:05,000
YOU WILL BE HELD
PERSONALLY RESPONSIBLE.

756
01:08:06,868 --> 01:08:08,868
I WILL SEE
WHAT WE CAN DO.

757
01:08:20,801 --> 01:08:23,167
MAMA, MAMA!
