1
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,827
Three, two, one, take two.

2
00:00:56,877 --> 00:00:59,792
Good morning.
Welcome to Erin Mills town centre.

3
00:00:59,836 --> 00:01:03,669
Home of the world's largest, permanent,
point-of-purchase video wall installation.

4
00:01:03,716 --> 00:01:08,376
My name is Kelvin Flook
and I'm your video host all day here at EMTV.

5
00:01:08,427 --> 00:01:11,546
I want to take this opportunity to extend
a special and warm welcome

6
00:01:11,596 --> 00:01:13,590
to the film crew from Necessary Illusions.

7
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:16,889
We've got an excellent line-up
of television programming today,

8
00:01:16,934 --> 00:01:19,010
so... let's get on with it.

9
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:25,013
So, how long have they been working
on this documentary?

10
00:01:25,066 --> 00:01:29,608
Gosh, they've been working on it
I don't know how long.

11
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:32,569
Every country I show up, they're always there.

12
00:01:32,613 --> 00:01:35,400
They're in England, they're in Japan.

13
00:01:35,449 --> 00:01:36,943
All over the place.

14
00:01:36,993 --> 00:01:41,203
Jesus.
They must have 500 hours of tape.

15
00:01:41,246 --> 00:01:44,495
Bet they put together a really doozy
when they're done, huh?

16
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:48,122
I can't imagine who's going to want
to hear somebody talk for an hour.

17
00:01:48,168 --> 00:01:50,456
But I guess they know what they're doing.

18
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:54,040
So, where are you all from?

19
00:01:54,089 --> 00:01:55,997
Florida.
- Florida?

20
00:01:56,048 --> 00:01:57,757
Yeah, Gulf Coast.

21
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:59,460
You all talk like in chorus.

22
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:04,088
We're making a film about Noam Chomsky.
Does anybody know who Noam Chomsky is?

23
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:05,384
No!

24
00:02:59,517 --> 00:03:02,186
Good aternoon and welcome
to Wyoming Talks.

25
00:03:02,228 --> 00:03:05,974
My guest today is well-known intellectual
Noam Chomsky.

26
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:08,642
Thank you for being on our programme today.

27
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:10,149
Very glad to be here.

28
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:13,809
I know probably the main purpose for your trip
to Wyoming

29
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:17,728
is to discuss thought control
in a democratic society.

30
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:22,822
Now, all right, say I'm just Jane USA.

31
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:28,492
And I say, "Well, gee, this is a democratic
society, what do you mean - thought control?"

32
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:31,706
"I make up my own mind.
I create my own destiny".

33
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:33,375
What would you say to her?

34
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:40,131
Well, I would suggest that Jane take
a close look at the way the media operate,

35
00:03:40,174 --> 00:03:43,009
the way the public relations industry operates.

36
00:03:43,052 --> 00:03:49,848
The extensive thinking that's been going on
for a long, long period,

37
00:03:49,891 --> 00:03:52,381
about the necessity for finding ways

38
00:03:52,434 --> 00:03:56,513
to marginalise and control the public
in a democratic society.

39
00:04:00,565 --> 00:04:04,183
But particularly to look at the evidence
that's been accumulated,

40
00:04:04,235 --> 00:04:07,486
about the way the major media,

41
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,863
The agenda-setting media,
I mean, the national press,

42
00:04:10,908 --> 00:04:12,401
and the television and so on,

43
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,992
the way that they shape and control
the kinds of opinions that appear.

44
00:04:17,037 --> 00:04:20,820
The kinds of information that comes through,
the sources to which they go.

45
00:04:20,874 --> 00:04:25,499
I think Jane will find some very surprising things
about the democratic system.

46
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:40,262
I'd like to welcome all of you
to this lecture today.

47
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:43,674
Several years ago,
Professor Chomsky was described

48
00:04:43,725 --> 00:04:46,512
in The New York Times Book Review
as follows:

49
00:04:47,769 --> 00:04:50,177
"Judged in terms of the power, range, novelty

50
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:55,650
and influence of this thought, Noam Chomsky is
arguably the most important intellectual alive."

51
00:04:56,693 --> 00:04:58,354
Professor Noam Chomsky.

52
00:05:07,662 --> 00:05:12,156
I gather there are some people
behind that blackness there.

53
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:17,248
But if I don't look you in the eye, it's because
I don't see you, all I see is the blackness.

54
00:05:18,378 --> 00:05:22,126
Perhaps I ought to begin
by reporting something that's never read.

55
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:27,546
The line about "arguably the most important
intellectual in the world," and so on

56
00:05:27,594 --> 00:05:30,345
comes from a publisher's blurb
and you got to watch those.

57
00:05:30,388 --> 00:05:34,682
If you go back to the original,
you'll find that that sentence is actually there.

58
00:05:34,726 --> 00:05:36,467
This is in The New York Times.

59
00:05:36,517 --> 00:05:38,426
But the next sentence is,

60
00:05:38,477 --> 00:05:44,846
"Since that's the case, how can he write such
terrible things about American foreign policy?"

61
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:46,690
They never quote that part.

62
00:05:46,734 --> 00:05:50,944
If it wasn't for that second sentence, I'd begin
to think that I'm doing something wrong.

63
00:05:50,987 --> 00:05:52,944
And I'm not joking about that.

64
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:57,816
It's true that the Emperor doesn't have
any clothes but he doesn't like to be told it.

65
00:05:57,868 --> 00:06:03,905
The Emperor's lap dogs, like The New York
Times, will not enjoy the experience if you do.

66
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:06,452
Good evening. I'm Bill Moyers.

67
00:06:06,501 --> 00:06:09,335
What's more dangerous:
The big stick of the big lie?

68
00:06:09,378 --> 00:06:11,999
Governments have used both
against their own people.

69
00:06:12,047 --> 00:06:15,248
Tonight I'll be talking with a man
who has been thinking about

70
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:17,125
how we can see the developing lie.

71
00:06:17,175 --> 00:06:22,002
He says that propaganda is to democracy
what violence is to a dictatorship.

72
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:26,716
But he hasn't lost faith in the power of
common people to speak up for the truth.

73
00:06:27,809 --> 00:06:33,348
You have said that we live
entangled in webs of endless deceit,

74
00:06:33,397 --> 00:06:39,350
that we live in a highly indoctrinated society,
where elementary truths are easily buried.

75
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:41,061
Elementary truths such as...

76
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:43,863
Such as the fact
that we invaded South Vietnam.

77
00:06:43,906 --> 00:06:48,447
Or that we're standing in the way of significant,
and have for years,

78
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:51,327
of significant moves towards arms negotiation.

79
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,873
Or the fact that the military system
is to a substantial extent,

80
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,158
not totally, but to a substantial extent,

81
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:03,835
a mechanism by which the general population
is compelled to provide a subsidy

82
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,788
to high-technology industry.

83
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,963
Since they're not going to do it if you ask them
to, you have to deceive them into doing it.

84
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:13,298
There are many truths like that.
We don't face them.

85
00:07:13,345 --> 00:07:15,587
Do you believe in common sense?

86
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:18,888
Absolutely.
I believe in Cartesian common sense.

87
00:07:18,933 --> 00:07:25,053
I think people have the capacities to see
through the deceit in which they're ensnared.

88
00:07:25,105 --> 00:07:26,729
But you got to make the effort.

89
00:07:26,773 --> 00:07:30,022
It seems a little incongruous
to hear a man from the ivory tower

90
00:07:30,067 --> 00:07:37,232
of Massachusetts Institute of Technology,
a scholar... a distinguished linguistics scholar,

91
00:07:37,282 --> 00:07:40,317
talk about common people
with such appreciation.

92
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:46,535
I think scholarship, at least the field I work in,
has the opposite consequences.

93
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:52,783
My own studies in language and human
cognition demonstrate to me, at least,

94
00:07:52,835 --> 00:07:56,620
what remarkable creativity
ordinary people have.

95
00:07:56,673 --> 00:08:03,504
The very fact that people talk to one another
just in a normal way, nothing particularly fancy,

96
00:08:03,553 --> 00:08:08,380
reflects deep-seated features
of human creativity,

97
00:08:08,432 --> 00:08:12,096
which separate human beings
from any other biological system we know.

98
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:16,222
Tonight, scientists talk to the animals.
But are they talking back?

99
00:08:20,858 --> 00:08:24,772
The Journal with Barbara Frum
and Mary Lou Finlay.

100
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,567
Communicating with animals
is a serious scientific pursuit.

101
00:08:28,614 --> 00:08:30,523
This is Nim Chimpsky.

102
00:08:30,574 --> 00:08:34,025
Nim, jokingly named ater
the great linguist Noam Chomsky,

103
00:08:34,078 --> 00:08:37,659
was the great hope of animal communication
in the 1970s.

104
00:08:37,704 --> 00:08:41,654
For four years Pettito and others coached him
in sign language,

105
00:08:41,709 --> 00:08:44,791
but in the end they decided it was a lost cause.

106
00:08:44,835 --> 00:08:47,504
Nim could ask for things, but not much more.

107
00:08:47,546 --> 00:08:51,496
I would have loved
to have a conversation with Nim

108
00:08:51,549 --> 00:08:54,004
and understand how he looked at the universe.

109
00:08:54,051 --> 00:08:58,962
He failed to communicate that information to
me, and we gave him every opportunity.

110
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:06,843
Noam Chomsky,
theorist of language and political activist,

111
00:09:06,895 --> 00:09:08,934
has had an extraordinary career.

112
00:09:08,979 --> 00:09:12,847
I can think of none like it in recent American
history and few anywhere any time.

113
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:17,642
He has literally transformed
the subject of linguistics.

114
00:09:17,696 --> 00:09:22,440
He also has become one of the most consistent
critics of power politics in all its protean guises.

115
00:09:23,326 --> 00:09:29,113
Scholar and propagandist, his two careers
apparently reinforce each other.

116
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:32,247
In 1957, he published his Syntactic Structures,

117
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:36,702
which began what has frequently been called
the Chomskyan Revolution in Linguistics.

118
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,588
Like a latter-day Copernicus,

119
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:45,463
Chomsky proposed a radically new way
of looking at the theory of grammar.

120
00:09:46,427 --> 00:09:49,961
Chomsky worked out the formal rules
of the universal grammar

121
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:54,224
which had generated the specific rules
of actual or natural languages.

122
00:09:57,186 --> 00:10:03,104
The general approach I'm taking seems to me
rather simple minded and unsophisticated,

123
00:10:03,148 --> 00:10:05,817
but, nevertheless, correct.

124
00:10:12,406 --> 00:10:16,403
Later he came to argue that such systems
are innate features of human beings.

125
00:10:16,451 --> 00:10:19,487
They belong to the characteristics
of the species

126
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:21,825
and have been, in effect, programmed

127
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:25,656
into the genetic equipment of the mind
like the machine language in a computer.

128
00:10:25,709 --> 00:10:28,625
One needn't be interested in this question.

129
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:30,994
Of course, I am interested in it.

130
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:35,292
The interesting question from this point of view
is what is the nature of the initial state?

131
00:10:35,341 --> 00:10:38,093
That is, what is human nature in this respect?

132
00:10:38,135 --> 00:10:43,839
That in turn explains the...

133
00:10:43,889 --> 00:10:45,965
...astonishing.

134
00:10:47,601 --> 00:10:49,594
Try the next one.

135
00:10:49,645 --> 00:10:53,178
Fa-cki-li-ty

136
00:10:53,231 --> 00:10:54,689
- Facility.
- Facility.

137
00:10:54,732 --> 00:10:58,101
That in turn explains the
astonishing facility children have

138
00:10:58,152 --> 00:11:02,362
in learning the rules of natural language,
no matter how complicated, incredibly quickly,

139
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:06,069
from what are imperfect
and oten degenerate samples.

140
00:11:06,116 --> 00:11:09,152
- Compli...
- Complicated.

141
00:11:09,202 --> 00:11:10,780
It's a complicated word.

142
00:11:10,828 --> 00:11:14,777
Do you know what "complicated" means?
It means it's complicated.

143
00:11:19,711 --> 00:11:22,081
If in fact our minds were a blank slate

144
00:11:22,128 --> 00:11:27,004
and experience wrote on them, we would be
very impoverished creatures indeed,

145
00:11:27,050 --> 00:11:29,919
so the obvious hypothesis is that our language

146
00:11:29,968 --> 00:11:34,012
is the result of the unfolding
of a genetically determined programme.

147
00:11:34,055 --> 00:11:36,676
Well, plainly there are different languages.

148
00:11:36,724 --> 00:11:41,017
In fact, the apparent variation of languages
is quite superficial.

149
00:11:41,061 --> 00:11:43,896
It's certain - as certain as anything else is -

150
00:11:43,939 --> 00:11:48,230
that humans are not genetically programmed
to learn one or another language.

151
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:52,853
So, you bring up a Japanese baby in Boston,
and it'll speak Boston English.

152
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:55,774
You bring up my child in Japan,
it'll speak Japanese.

153
00:11:56,656 --> 00:12:00,903
And that means that... From that it fol...
from that it simply follows by logic

154
00:12:00,952 --> 00:12:04,735
that the basic structure of the languages
must be essentially the same.

155
00:12:04,789 --> 00:12:11,785
Our task as scientists is to try to determine
exactly what those fundamental principles are

156
00:12:11,835 --> 00:12:16,462
that cause the knowledge of language to unfold
in the manner in which it does

157
00:12:16,507 --> 00:12:18,582
under particular circumstances.

158
00:12:18,633 --> 00:12:21,633
Incidentally,
I think there is no doubt the same must be true

159
00:12:21,677 --> 00:12:24,049
of other aspects of human intelligence,

160
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:27,678
and systems of understanding
and interpretation,

161
00:12:27,723 --> 00:12:31,009
and moral and aesthetic judgement, and so on.

162
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:35,270
The implications of these views
have washed over the fields of psychology,

163
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:39,227
education, sociology, philosophy,
literary criticism, and logic.

164
00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:45,858
In the '50s and '60s
the bridge between your theoretical work

165
00:12:45,904 --> 00:12:49,319
and your political work seems to have been
the attack on behaviourism,

166
00:12:49,365 --> 00:12:53,149
but now behaviourism is no longer an issue,
or so it seems,

167
00:12:53,202 --> 00:12:57,246
so how does this leave the link
between your linguistics and your politics?

168
00:12:57,288 --> 00:13:01,535
Well, I've always regarded the link... I've never...

169
00:13:01,584 --> 00:13:04,336
really perceived much of a link,
to tell you the truth.

170
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:10,794
Again, I would be very pleased to be able to
discover intellectually convincing connections

171
00:13:11,843 --> 00:13:15,293
between my own anarchist convictions
on the one hand,

172
00:13:15,345 --> 00:13:19,294
and what I think I can demonstrate,
or at least begin to see

173
00:13:19,348 --> 00:13:22,384
about the nature of human intelligence
on the other.

174
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:28,637
But I simply can't find intellectually satisfying
connections between those two domains.

175
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:32,187
I can discover some tenuous points of contact.

176
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:36,100
FOUCAULT

177
00:14:13,308 --> 00:14:18,384
If it is correct, as I believe it is,
that a fundamental element of human nature

178
00:14:18,437 --> 00:14:26,728
is the need for creative work,
or creative inquiry for...

179
00:14:27,778 --> 00:14:32,522
...for free creation without the...

180
00:14:32,573 --> 00:14:35,942
...arbitrary, limiting effects of coercive
institutions,

181
00:14:35,993 --> 00:14:43,122
then of course it will follow that a decent society
should maximise the possibilities

182
00:14:43,165 --> 00:14:47,873
for this fundamental human characteristic
to be realised.

183
00:14:47,919 --> 00:14:53,375
Now, a federated, decentralised...

184
00:14:54,425 --> 00:15:00,592
...system of free associations incorporating
economic as well as social institutions

185
00:15:00,638 --> 00:15:04,006
would be what I refer to as
anarcho-syndicalism,

186
00:15:04,057 --> 00:15:08,932
and it seems to me that
it is the appropriate form of social organisation

187
00:15:08,978 --> 00:15:11,729
for an advanced technological society

188
00:15:11,772 --> 00:15:17,892
in which human beings do not have to be forced
into the position of tools, of cogs in a machine.

189
00:15:19,278 --> 00:15:22,232
Since the 1960s
Noam Chomsky has been the voice

190
00:15:22,281 --> 00:15:26,360
of a very characteristic brand
of rationalist libertarian socialism.

191
00:15:27,451 --> 00:15:30,202
He's attacked the abuses of power
wherever he saw them,

192
00:15:30,245 --> 00:15:34,621
he's made himself deeply unpopular
by his criticism of American policy,

193
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:38,876
the subservience of the intelligentsia,
the degradation of Zionism,

194
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:42,416
the distortions of media,
and self-delusions of prevailing ideologies.

195
00:15:50,886 --> 00:15:54,136
Under the liberal administration of the 1960s

196
00:15:54,180 --> 00:16:00,847
the club of academic intellectuals
designed and implemented the Vietnam war,

197
00:16:00,895 --> 00:16:06,314
and other similar, though smaller, actions.

198
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:10,983
This particular community is a very relevant one
to consider at a place like MIT

199
00:16:11,028 --> 00:16:14,727
because of course you're all free
to enter into this community.

200
00:16:14,781 --> 00:16:17,402
In fact,
you're invited and encouraged to enter it.

201
00:16:17,450 --> 00:16:20,949
The community of technical intelligentsia,

202
00:16:20,995 --> 00:16:25,121
and weapons designers,
and counter-insurgency experts,

203
00:16:25,164 --> 00:16:27,655
and pragmatic planners of an American empire,

204
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:33,827
is one that you have a great deal of inducement
to become associated with.

205
00:16:33,879 --> 00:16:36,086
The inducements, in fact, are very real.

206
00:16:36,132 --> 00:16:41,670
The rewards in power, and affluence,
and prestige, and authority...

207
00:16:44,722 --> 00:16:46,797
Jamie?

208
00:16:48,016 --> 00:16:50,092
This came with the mail.

209
00:16:51,685 --> 00:16:53,760
Be with you in a second.

210
00:17:02,777 --> 00:17:04,853
Oh, God, they've still got their cameras.

211
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:06,482
OK?

212
00:17:11,868 --> 00:17:13,695
We'll start.

213
00:17:13,745 --> 00:17:16,450
In your essay Language and Freedom,

214
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:20,625
you write, "Social action must be animated
by a vision of a future society".

215
00:17:20,667 --> 00:17:25,375
I was wondering what vision of a future society
animates you?

216
00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:30,122
I have my own ideas
as to what a future society should look like.

217
00:17:31,635 --> 00:17:35,049
I've written about them.
I mean, I think that we should...

218
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:43,557
At the most general level, we should be
seeking out forms of authority and domination,

219
00:17:43,602 --> 00:17:45,927
and challenging their legitimacy.

220
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:50,726
Sometimes they are legitimate -
that is, let's say they're needed for survival.

221
00:17:50,774 --> 00:17:57,310
So, for example, I wouldn't suggest
that during the Second World War...

222
00:17:57,363 --> 00:18:00,779
the forms of authority...
We had a totalitarian society, basically.

223
00:18:00,825 --> 00:18:04,323
I thought there was some justification for that
under wartime conditions.

224
00:18:04,369 --> 00:18:06,445
And there are other forms of...

225
00:18:06,495 --> 00:18:10,872
Relations between parents and children,
for example, involve forms of coercion

226
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,991
which are sometimes justifiable.

227
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:18,036
But any such... Any form of coercion and...

228
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:22,251
control requires justification,
and most of them are completely unjustifiable.

229
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:28,052
Now, at various stages of human civilisation
it's been possible to challenge some of them,

230
00:18:28,095 --> 00:18:29,506
but not others.

231
00:18:29,555 --> 00:18:32,924
Others are too deep-seated,
or you don't see them, or whatever,

232
00:18:32,975 --> 00:18:39,142
so at any particular point you try to
detect those forms of authority and domination

233
00:18:40,189 --> 00:18:44,482
which are subject to change, and which...

234
00:18:44,526 --> 00:18:46,150
do not have any legitimacy,

235
00:18:46,194 --> 00:18:48,898
in fact which oten
strike at fundamental human rights,

236
00:18:48,946 --> 00:18:52,729
and your understanding
of fundamental human nature and rights.

237
00:18:52,783 --> 00:18:55,024
Well, what are the major things, say today?

238
00:18:55,076 --> 00:18:57,780
There are some
that are being addressed in a way.

239
00:18:59,163 --> 00:19:03,491
The feminist movement is addressing some.
The civil rights movement is addressing others.

240
00:19:03,541 --> 00:19:06,162
The one major one
that is not being seriously addressed

241
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:09,246
is the one that's really
at the core of the system of domination,

242
00:19:09,296 --> 00:19:12,415
and that's private control over resources.

243
00:19:12,465 --> 00:19:17,007
And that means an attack
on the fundamental structure of state capitalism.

244
00:19:17,052 --> 00:19:20,752
I think that's in order.
That's not something far off in the future.

245
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:23,381
Your life work.

246
00:19:24,975 --> 00:19:27,679
The alphabet has only 26 letters.

247
00:19:28,311 --> 00:19:31,228
With these 26 magic symbols, however,

248
00:19:31,271 --> 00:19:33,644
millions of words are written every day.

249
00:19:35,525 --> 00:19:37,601
Nowhere else are people so addicted

250
00:19:37,653 --> 00:19:40,854
to information and entertainment
via the printed word.

251
00:19:41,947 --> 00:19:45,150
Every day the world comes thumping
on the American doorstep,

252
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,525
and nothing that happens anywhere

253
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:51,324
remains long a secret
from the American newspaper reader.

254
00:19:52,415 --> 00:19:55,414
It comes to us pretty casually, the daily paper,

255
00:19:55,457 --> 00:19:57,616
but behind its arrival on your doorstep

256
00:19:57,668 --> 00:20:00,158
is one ofjournalism's major stories.

257
00:20:00,212 --> 00:20:01,670
How it got there.

258
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:12,714
There is a standard view about democratic
societies, and the role of the media within them.

259
00:20:12,763 --> 00:20:16,713
It's expressed for example
by Supreme Court Justice Powell

260
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,265
when he spoke of the crucial role of the media

261
00:20:20,311 --> 00:20:24,059
in effecting the societal purpose
of the First Amendment,

262
00:20:24,106 --> 00:20:30,226
namely enabling the public to assert
meaningful control over the political process.

263
00:20:32,071 --> 00:20:35,438
That kind of formulation
expresses the understanding that

264
00:20:35,489 --> 00:20:42,404
democracy requires free access
to information, and ideas, and opinion,

265
00:20:42,453 --> 00:20:48,207
and the same conceptions hold
not only with regard to the media,

266
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:54,418
but with regard to educational institutions,
publishing, the intellectual community generally.

267
00:20:57,342 --> 00:20:59,748
It is basic to the health of a democracy

268
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:03,929
that no phase of government activity
escape the scrutiny of the press.

269
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:09,724
Here reporters are assigned to stories
fateful not only to our nation, but to all nations.

270
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:12,093
"Congress", says the First Amendment,

271
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:14,849
"shall pass no law
abridging the freedom of the press".

272
00:21:14,897 --> 00:21:19,190
And the Chief Executive himself
throws open the doors of the White House

273
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:23,100
to journalists representing papers
of all shades of political opinion.

274
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:33,110
But is worth bearing in mind
that there is a contrary view,

275
00:21:33,161 --> 00:21:37,621
and in fact the contrary view is very widely held,
and deeply rooted

276
00:21:37,665 --> 00:21:39,741
in our own civilisation.

277
00:21:40,793 --> 00:21:44,541
It goes back to
the origins of modern democracy,

278
00:21:44,588 --> 00:21:47,753
to the 17th-century English revolution

279
00:21:47,798 --> 00:21:51,878
which was a complicated affair
like most popular revolutions.

280
00:21:51,927 --> 00:21:54,416
There was a struggle between Parliament

281
00:21:54,470 --> 00:21:58,420
representing largely
elements of the gentry and the merchants,

282
00:21:58,474 --> 00:22:01,509
and the Royalists
representing other elite groups,

283
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:03,386
and they fought it out.

284
00:22:03,435 --> 00:22:05,263
But like many popular revolutions,

285
00:22:05,313 --> 00:22:09,688
there was also a lot of popular ferment going
that was opposed to all of them.

286
00:22:09,732 --> 00:22:13,231
There were popular movements
that were questioning everything -

287
00:22:13,277 --> 00:22:18,187
the relations between master and servant,
the right of authority altogether...

288
00:22:18,239 --> 00:22:20,528
All kinds of things were being questioned.

289
00:22:20,575 --> 00:22:25,034
There was a lot of radical publishing - the
printing presses had just come into existence -

290
00:22:25,078 --> 00:22:28,862
and this disturbed all the elites
on both sides of the Civil War.

291
00:22:28,915 --> 00:22:34,204
So as one historian pointed out at the time
in 1660...

292
00:22:34,252 --> 00:22:36,375
He criticised the radical democrats,

293
00:22:36,421 --> 00:22:39,338
the ones who were calling for
what we would call democracy, because...

294
00:22:50,223 --> 00:22:54,801
Now, underlying these doctrines
which were very widely held

295
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:57,058
is a certain conception of democracy.

296
00:22:57,104 --> 00:22:59,429
It's a game for elites.

297
00:22:59,481 --> 00:23:01,769
It's not for the ignorant masses

298
00:23:01,816 --> 00:23:06,062
who have to be marginalised,
diverted and controlled

299
00:23:06,111 --> 00:23:08,187
of course, for their own good.

300
00:23:08,238 --> 00:23:13,314
The same principles were upheld
in the American colonies.

301
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:18,029
The dictum of the founding fathers
of American democracy that:

302
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,530
"People who own the country
ought to govern it",

303
00:23:21,582 --> 00:23:23,658
quoting John Jay.

304
00:23:23,709 --> 00:23:26,116
Fire!

305
00:23:33,008 --> 00:23:35,416
Now, in modern times for elites,

306
00:23:35,468 --> 00:23:40,544
this contrary view about the intellectual life,
and the media, and so on,

307
00:23:40,597 --> 00:23:46,136
this contrary view in fact is the standard one,
I think, apart from rhetorical flourishes.

308
00:23:48,896 --> 00:23:53,521
From Washington DC,
he is intellectual, author and linguist

309
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:55,642
Professor Noam Chomsky.

310
00:23:55,692 --> 00:24:00,484
Manufacturing Consent -
what is that title meant to describe?

311
00:24:00,529 --> 00:24:07,943
Well, the title is actually borrowed from a book
by Walter Lippmann written back around 1921

312
00:24:07,994 --> 00:24:11,825
in which he described
what he called the manufacture of consent

313
00:24:11,872 --> 00:24:15,704
as a revolution in the practice of democracy.

314
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:19,084
What it amounts to is a technique of control,

315
00:24:19,129 --> 00:24:22,414
and he said this was useful and necessary

316
00:24:22,465 --> 00:24:28,134
because the common interests, the general
concerns of all people, elude the public.

317
00:24:28,178 --> 00:24:30,633
The public just isn't up to dealing with them,

318
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:34,546
and they have to be the domain
of what he called a specialized class.

319
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:40,767
Notice that that's the opposite
of the standard view about democracy.

320
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:47,689
There's a version of this expressed
by the highly respected moralist and theologian

321
00:24:47,734 --> 00:24:49,276
Reinhold Niebuhr

322
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:53,897
who was very influential
on contemporary policy makers.

323
00:24:53,948 --> 00:24:58,027
His view was
that rationality belongs to the cool observer,

324
00:24:58,910 --> 00:25:04,864
but because of the stupidity of the average
man, he follows not reason but faith,

325
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:11,169
and this naïve faith
requires necessary illusion

326
00:25:12,129 --> 00:25:15,296
and emotionally potent over-simplifications

327
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:19,918
which are provided by the myth maker
to keep the ordinary person on course.

328
00:25:28,184 --> 00:25:30,853
It's not the case, as the naïve might think,

329
00:25:30,894 --> 00:25:34,014
that indoctrination
is inconsistent with democracy.

330
00:25:34,063 --> 00:25:37,266
Rather, as this whole line of thinkers observes,

331
00:25:37,316 --> 00:25:39,107
it's the essence of democracy.

332
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:44,566
The point is that in a military state,
or a feudal state,

333
00:25:44,613 --> 00:25:47,282
or what we would nowadays
call a totalitarian state,

334
00:25:47,324 --> 00:25:49,731
it doesn't much matter what people think,

335
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:54,362
because you've got a bludgeon over their head,
and you can control what they do.

336
00:25:55,915 --> 00:26:00,492
But when the state loses the bludgeon,
when you can't control people by force,

337
00:26:00,543 --> 00:26:03,212
and when the voice of the people can be heard,

338
00:26:03,254 --> 00:26:07,499
you have this problem -
it may make people so curious and so arrogant

339
00:26:07,548 --> 00:26:11,249
that they don't have the humility
to submit to a civil rule,

340
00:26:11,302 --> 00:26:14,385
and therefore you have to
control what people think.

341
00:26:16,264 --> 00:26:17,972
And the standard way to do this

342
00:26:18,016 --> 00:26:22,640
is to resort to what in more honest days
used to be called propaganda.

343
00:26:22,685 --> 00:26:24,180
Manufacture of consent.

344
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:27,982
The creation of necessary illusions.

345
00:26:28,024 --> 00:26:30,810
Various ways of
either marginalising the general public,

346
00:26:30,858 --> 00:26:33,350
or reducing them to apathy in some fashion.

347
00:27:14,019 --> 00:27:15,928
The oldest of two boys,

348
00:27:15,979 --> 00:27:21,138
Avram Noam Chomsky was born in
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1928.

349
00:27:22,234 --> 00:27:26,147
As a Jewish child,
the anti-Semitism of the time affected him.

350
00:27:27,238 --> 00:27:31,151
Both parents taught Hebrew,
and he became fascinated by literature,

351
00:27:31,199 --> 00:27:35,149
reading translations
of French and Russian classics.

352
00:27:35,203 --> 00:27:39,152
He also took an interest
in a grammar book written by his father

353
00:27:39,206 --> 00:27:41,032
on Hebrew of the Middle Ages.

354
00:27:42,083 --> 00:27:46,459
He recalls a childhood
absorbed in reading curled up on the sofa,

355
00:27:46,503 --> 00:27:50,251
oten borrowing up to 12 books at once
from the library.

356
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:54,046
He is married to Carol,
and they have three children.

357
00:27:54,093 --> 00:27:57,295
I don't like to
impose on my wife and children a form of life

358
00:27:57,345 --> 00:27:59,800
that they certainly
haven't selected for themselves,

359
00:27:59,847 --> 00:28:03,263
namely one of public exposure,
exposure to the public media.

360
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:07,973
That's their choice, and I don't believe
they themselves have selected this.

361
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,064
I don't impose it on them,
and I would like to protect them from it, frankly.

362
00:28:12,106 --> 00:28:18,145
The second sort of perhaps principled point
is that I'm rather against the whole notion

363
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:23,071
of developing public personalities...

364
00:28:24,492 --> 00:28:26,983
...who are treated as stars
of one kind or another,

365
00:28:27,037 --> 00:28:30,700
where aspects of their personal life
are supposed to have some significance.

366
00:28:30,747 --> 00:28:32,574
Take one in the reception room.

367
00:28:33,625 --> 00:28:38,036
You said you were just like us -
you went to school, got good grades.

368
00:28:38,086 --> 00:28:40,659
What made you start being critical, you know,

369
00:28:40,714 --> 00:28:42,622
and seeing the different...

370
00:28:42,674 --> 00:28:44,749
What started the change?

371
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:48,667
Well, you know, there are all kinds
of personal factors in anybody's life.

372
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,961
Don't forget I grew up in the Depression.

373
00:29:09,528 --> 00:29:14,190
My parents actually happened to have jobs,
which was kind of unusual.

374
00:29:14,241 --> 00:29:17,904
They were Hebrew school teachers,
so lower middle class.

375
00:29:17,951 --> 00:29:21,819
For them,
everything revolved around being Jewish.

376
00:29:21,872 --> 00:29:25,323
Hebrew, and Palestine in those days,
and so on.

377
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:29,417
I grew up in that milieu, so I learned Hebrew,
went to Hebrew school,

378
00:29:29,462 --> 00:29:34,087
became a Hebrew school teacher,
went to Hebrew college, led youth groups,

379
00:29:34,131 --> 00:29:35,626
summer camp, Hebrew camps...

380
00:29:35,675 --> 00:29:37,050
The whole business.

381
00:29:38,385 --> 00:29:42,678
The branch of Zionist movement
that I was part of

382
00:29:42,722 --> 00:29:46,849
was all involved in socialist bi-nationalism,
and Arab-Jewish cooperation,

383
00:29:46,892 --> 00:29:49,097
and all sorts of nice stuff.

384
00:30:02,654 --> 00:30:06,070
What did they think of you
hopping on a train, going up to New York,

385
00:30:06,116 --> 00:30:10,491
and hanging out at anarchist book stores
on Fourth Avenue, and talking to...

386
00:30:10,535 --> 00:30:12,658
They didn't mind, because...

387
00:30:12,704 --> 00:30:15,990
I don't want to totally trust
my childhood memories, obviously,

388
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:17,913
but the family was split up.

389
00:30:17,958 --> 00:30:21,161
Like a lot of Jewish families,
it went in all sorts of directions.

390
00:30:21,211 --> 00:30:23,915
There were sectors that were super-Orthodox.

391
00:30:23,963 --> 00:30:28,540
There were other sectors
that were very radical, and very assimilated,

392
00:30:28,591 --> 00:30:30,466
and working-class intellectuals,

393
00:30:30,511 --> 00:30:34,886
and that's the sector
that I naturally gravitated towards.

394
00:30:34,930 --> 00:30:37,634
It was a very lively intellectual culture.

395
00:30:37,682 --> 00:30:41,347
For one thing, it was a working-class culture,
had working-class values.

396
00:30:41,393 --> 00:30:46,055
Values of solidarity, socialist values, and so on.

397
00:30:46,106 --> 00:30:48,514
There was a sense
somehow things would get better.

398
00:30:48,567 --> 00:30:53,358
An institutional structure was around, a method
of fighting, of organising, of doing things

399
00:30:53,404 --> 00:30:55,147
which had some hope.

400
00:30:55,197 --> 00:31:01,150
And I also had the advantage of having gone
to an experimental progressive school,

401
00:31:01,201 --> 00:31:03,277
to a Deweyite school which was quite good,

402
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:07,906
run by a university there, and you know,
there was no such thing as competition.

403
00:31:07,957 --> 00:31:10,282
There was no such thing
as being a good student.

404
00:31:12,086 --> 00:31:16,378
Literally, the concept of being a good student
didn't even arise until I got to high school.

405
00:31:16,422 --> 00:31:20,466
I went to the academic high school,
and suddenly discovered I'm a good student.

406
00:31:20,509 --> 00:31:24,588
I hated high school, because I had to do
all the things you have to do to get into college.

407
00:31:24,636 --> 00:31:28,681
But until then,
it was kind of a free, pretty open system,

408
00:31:28,724 --> 00:31:30,514
and lots of other things as well.

409
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:32,183
Maybe I was just cantankerous.

410
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:35,932
As a historian,
I have read with interest and amazement

411
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:39,264
your long review article
of Gabriel Jackson's Spanish Civil War.

412
00:31:39,315 --> 00:31:43,147
It's a very respectable piece of history.
I appreciate how much work goes into it.

413
00:31:43,194 --> 00:31:44,900
You know when I did that work?

414
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:48,563
I did that work in the early 1940s
when I was about 12 years old.

415
00:31:55,704 --> 00:32:00,578
The first article I wrote was right
ater the fall of Barcelona in the school paper,

416
00:32:00,623 --> 00:32:04,835
and it was a lament
about the rise of Fascism in 1939.

417
00:32:08,923 --> 00:32:12,421
I guess one of the people who was
the biggest influence in my life was an uncle

418
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:18,255
who had never gone past fourth grade,
had a background in crime,

419
00:32:18,305 --> 00:32:20,677
and let-wing politics, and all sorts of things.

420
00:32:21,725 --> 00:32:23,882
But he was a hunchback,

421
00:32:23,934 --> 00:32:26,970
and as a result
he could get a newsstand in New York.

422
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:31,018
They had some programme
for people with physical disabilities.

423
00:32:31,066 --> 00:32:35,275
Some of you are from New York, I guess.
Well, you know the 72nd Street kiosk?

424
00:32:35,318 --> 00:32:36,896
Yes!

425
00:32:36,945 --> 00:32:39,649
That's where I got my political education.

426
00:32:39,697 --> 00:32:44,274
At 72nd Street - where you come out of the
subway, everybody goes towards 72nd Street.

427
00:32:44,326 --> 00:32:47,943
There were two newsstands on that side
which were doing fine,

428
00:32:47,995 --> 00:32:49,370
and there's two on the back.

429
00:32:49,413 --> 00:32:52,367
Nobody comes out the back,
and that's where his newsstand...

430
00:32:55,751 --> 00:32:58,954
But it was a very lively place.
He was a very bright guy.

431
00:32:59,004 --> 00:33:01,922
It was the '30s. There were a lot of émigrés.

432
00:33:01,966 --> 00:33:05,630
A lot of people were hanging around there,
and in the evenings especially

433
00:33:05,677 --> 00:33:08,760
it was sort of a literary-political salon.

434
00:33:08,804 --> 00:33:12,088
There were, kind of, guys
hanging around arguing and talking, and...

435
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:14,808
as a kid, like 11, 12 years old,

436
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:17,851
the biggest excitement
was to work the newsstand.

437
00:33:21,981 --> 00:33:24,139
You write in Manufacturing Consent

438
00:33:24,192 --> 00:33:27,642
that it's the primary function of the mass media
in the United States

439
00:33:27,694 --> 00:33:30,611
to mobilise public support
for the special interests

440
00:33:30,655 --> 00:33:33,228
that dominate the government
and the private sector.

441
00:33:33,283 --> 00:33:35,274
What are those interests?

442
00:33:35,325 --> 00:33:38,196
Well, if you want to understand
the way any society works,

443
00:33:38,245 --> 00:33:39,620
ours or any other,

444
00:33:39,663 --> 00:33:43,326
the first place to look is who makes...
who is in a position

445
00:33:43,373 --> 00:33:46,824
to make the decisions
that determine the way the society functions.

446
00:33:46,876 --> 00:33:48,999
Societies differ, but in ours

447
00:33:49,045 --> 00:33:52,793
the major decisions
over what happens in the society -

448
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,338
decisions over investment, and production,
and distribution and so on -

449
00:33:56,384 --> 00:34:00,463
are in the hands of
a relatively concentrated network

450
00:34:00,511 --> 00:34:04,675
of major corporations and conglomerates,
and investment firms, and so on.

451
00:34:04,724 --> 00:34:10,227
They are also the ones who staff the major
executive positions in the government,

452
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,642
and they are the ones who own the media,

453
00:34:12,689 --> 00:34:16,389
and they are the ones who have to be
in a position to make the decisions.

454
00:34:16,441 --> 00:34:20,770
They have an overwhelmingly dominant role
in the way life happens,

455
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,026
you know, what's done in the society.

456
00:34:23,072 --> 00:34:27,614
Within the economic system,
by law and in principle, they dominate.

457
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:31,987
The control over resources,
and the need to satisfy their interests

458
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:34,160
imposes very sharp constraints

459
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:37,906
on the political system
and the ideological system.

460
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:46,415
When we talk about manufacturing of consent,
whose consent is being manufactured?

461
00:34:46,465 --> 00:34:48,838
To start with, there are two different groups.

462
00:34:48,885 --> 00:34:52,882
We can get into more detail,
but at the first level of approximation,

463
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:55,005
there's two targets for propaganda.

464
00:34:56,056 --> 00:34:58,595
One is what is sometimes called
the political class.

465
00:35:02,645 --> 00:35:05,314
There's maybe 20 per cent of the population

466
00:35:05,356 --> 00:35:08,891
which is relatively educated,
more or less articulate.

467
00:35:08,943 --> 00:35:12,108
They'll play some kind of role
in decision making.

468
00:35:12,153 --> 00:35:15,486
They're supposed to sort of participate
in social life,

469
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:21,817
either as managers, or cultural managers,
like, say, teachers, and writers, and so on.

470
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,862
They're supposed to vote.

471
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:29,914
They're supposed to play some role in the way
economic and political and cultural life goes on.

472
00:35:29,959 --> 00:35:32,082
Now, their consent is crucial.

473
00:35:32,128 --> 00:35:35,626
That's one group that has to be
deeply indoctrinated.

474
00:35:35,672 --> 00:35:38,756
Then there's maybe 80 per cent
of the population

475
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:41,716
whose main function is to follow orders,

476
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:43,302
and not to think, you know.

477
00:35:43,345 --> 00:35:45,587
Not to pay attention to anything,

478
00:35:45,639 --> 00:35:49,006
and they're the ones who usually pay the costs.

479
00:35:49,058 --> 00:35:51,464
All right, Professor Chomsky, Noam,

480
00:35:53,019 --> 00:35:59,388
you outlined a model - filters propaganda
is sent through on its way to the public.

481
00:35:59,441 --> 00:36:01,517
Will you briefly outline those?

482
00:36:01,568 --> 00:36:04,983
It's basically an institutional
analysis of the major media,

483
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:07,105
what we call a propaganda model.

484
00:36:07,156 --> 00:36:12,778
We're talking primarily about the national
media, those media that set a general agenda

485
00:36:12,826 --> 00:36:15,068
that others more or less adhere to,

486
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:20,908
to the extent that they even pay much attention
to national or international affairs.

487
00:36:20,958 --> 00:36:24,243
Now, the elite media are the sort of
agenda-setting media.

488
00:36:24,294 --> 00:36:26,370
The New York Times, The Washington Post,

489
00:36:26,422 --> 00:36:28,993
the major television channels, and so on.

490
00:36:30,049 --> 00:36:32,125
They set the general framework.

491
00:36:32,968 --> 00:36:36,501
Local media more or less adapt
to their structure.

492
00:36:39,264 --> 00:36:40,344
World news.

493
00:36:42,059 --> 00:36:45,059
It's a sound bite,
that says there's a beach head...

494
00:36:45,103 --> 00:36:47,178
I think 628 is a good one.

495
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:51,603
This is the operative sound bite for us.

496
00:36:53,276 --> 00:36:54,936
Got a minute for all the times.

497
00:36:55,819 --> 00:36:57,278
I love this sound bite.

498
00:36:57,321 --> 00:37:00,237
And they do this in all sorts of ways, by...

499
00:37:10,832 --> 00:37:13,453
Two and a half minutes to air.

500
00:37:15,377 --> 00:37:17,250
45 seconds.

501
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:31,548
There is an unusual amount of attention today
on the five nations of Central America.

502
00:37:31,598 --> 00:37:34,219
This is democracy's diary.

503
00:37:34,267 --> 00:37:37,517
Here, for our instruction,
are triumphs and disasters,

504
00:37:37,562 --> 00:37:40,597
the pattern of life's changing fabric.

505
00:37:40,647 --> 00:37:45,439
Here is great journalism,
a revelation of the past, a guide to the present,

506
00:37:45,485 --> 00:37:47,228
and a clue to the future.

507
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:09,495
The New York Times is certainly the most
important newspaper in the United States,

508
00:38:09,546 --> 00:38:13,210
and one could argue,
the most important newspaper in the world.

509
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:20,260
The New York Times plays an enormous role
in shaping the perception of the current world

510
00:38:20,304 --> 00:38:24,004
on the part of
the politically active, educated classes.

511
00:38:24,057 --> 00:38:26,548
Also, The New York Times has a special role,

512
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:30,301
and I believe its editors probably feel
that they bear a heavy burden

513
00:38:30,354 --> 00:38:34,814
in the sense that
The New York Times creates history.

514
00:38:34,857 --> 00:38:38,439
What happened years ago may
have a bearing on what happens tomorrow.

515
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:42,353
Millions of clippings
are preserved in the Times'library,

516
00:38:42,406 --> 00:38:44,481
all indexed for instant use.

517
00:38:44,531 --> 00:38:47,866
A priceless archive of events,
and the men who make them.

518
00:38:49,078 --> 00:38:52,410
That is, history is what appears in
The New York Times archives.

519
00:38:52,455 --> 00:38:56,073
The place where people will go to find out
what happened is The New York Times.

520
00:38:56,125 --> 00:39:00,869
Therefore it's extremely important,
if history is to be shaped in an appropriate way,

521
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:06,209
that certain things appear, certain things do not,
certain questions be asked, others be ignored,

522
00:39:06,257 --> 00:39:09,626
and that issues be framed
in a particular fashion.

523
00:39:09,677 --> 00:39:13,888
Now, in whose interests
is history being so shaped?

524
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:17,096
Well, I think that's not very difficult to answer.

525
00:39:17,141 --> 00:39:20,676
The process by which
people make up their minds on this

526
00:39:20,728 --> 00:39:23,099
is a much more mysterious process

527
00:39:23,146 --> 00:39:27,096
than you would ever guess
from reading Manufacturing Consent.

528
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:29,273
There is a saying about legislation,

529
00:39:29,319 --> 00:39:31,725
that legislation is like making sausage.

530
00:39:32,946 --> 00:39:37,856
The less you know about how it's done,
the better for your appetite.

531
00:39:37,907 --> 00:39:39,532
The same is true of this business.

532
00:39:39,576 --> 00:39:43,277
If you're in a conference
in which decisions are being made

533
00:39:43,330 --> 00:39:45,534
on what to put on page one, or what not,

534
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:51,914
you would get, I think, the impression
that important decisions were being made

535
00:39:51,961 --> 00:39:54,119
in a flippant and frivolous way,

536
00:39:54,171 --> 00:39:58,299
but in fact, given the pressures of time
to try to get things out,

537
00:39:58,342 --> 00:40:00,417
you resort to a kind of a shorthand,

538
00:40:00,469 --> 00:40:04,417
and you have to fill that paper up every day.

539
00:40:05,305 --> 00:40:08,260
It's curious in a kind of a mirror image way that

540
00:40:08,309 --> 00:40:12,684
Professor Chomsky is in total accord
with Reed Irvine

541
00:40:12,728 --> 00:40:17,934
who at the right-wing end of the spectrum
says exactly what Chomsky does

542
00:40:17,982 --> 00:40:23,604
about the insinuating influence of the press,
of the big media

543
00:40:23,653 --> 00:40:29,488
as "agenda setters", to use
one of the great buzz words of the time,

544
00:40:29,533 --> 00:40:33,862
and, of course,
Reed Irvine sees this as a let-wing conspiracy,

545
00:40:33,912 --> 00:40:38,704
of foisting liberal ideas in both domestic
and foreign affairs on the American people.

546
00:40:38,750 --> 00:40:42,283
But in both cases,
I think that the premise really is an insult

547
00:40:42,334 --> 00:40:45,288
to the intelligence of the people
who consume news.

548
00:40:45,337 --> 00:40:51,873
Now, to eliminate confusion, all of this has
nothing to do with liberal or conservative bias.

549
00:40:51,926 --> 00:40:56,670
According to the propaganda model, both
liberal and conservative wings of the media,

550
00:40:56,722 --> 00:40:58,797
whatever those terms are supposed to mean,

551
00:40:58,849 --> 00:41:02,430
fall within the same framework of assumptions.

552
00:41:02,476 --> 00:41:08,679
In fact, if the system functions well, it ought
to have a liberal bias, or at least appear to,

553
00:41:08,731 --> 00:41:11,649
because if it appears to have a liberal bias,

554
00:41:11,692 --> 00:41:14,894
that will serve to bound thought
even more effectively.

555
00:41:14,944 --> 00:41:20,365
In other words, if the press is indeed adversarial
and liberal, and all these bad things,

556
00:41:20,407 --> 00:41:22,483
then how can I go beyond it?

557
00:41:22,533 --> 00:41:26,911
They're already so extreme in their opposition
to power that to go beyond it

558
00:41:26,955 --> 00:41:29,030
would be to take off from the planet,

559
00:41:29,081 --> 00:41:32,082
so therefore it must be that the presuppositions

560
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:36,336
that are accepted in the liberal media
are sacrosanct.

561
00:41:36,378 --> 00:41:38,086
Can't go beyond them.

562
00:41:38,130 --> 00:41:41,913
And a well-functioning system
would in fact have a bias of that kind.

563
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:47,505
The media would then serve to say, in effect:
Thus far and no further.

564
00:41:47,554 --> 00:41:50,638
We ask what would you expect of those media

565
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:57,395
on just relatively uncontroversial,
guided-free market assumptions?

566
00:41:57,437 --> 00:42:00,721
And when you look at them,
you find a number of major factors

567
00:42:00,773 --> 00:42:03,442
entering into
determining what their products are.

568
00:42:03,483 --> 00:42:07,895
These are what we call the filters -
so one of them, for example, is ownership.

569
00:42:07,945 --> 00:42:10,317
Who owns them?

570
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:13,863
The major agenda-setting media,
ater all, what are they?

571
00:42:13,909 --> 00:42:16,399
As institutions in the society, what are they?

572
00:42:16,452 --> 00:42:19,073
Well, in the first place
they are major corporations.

573
00:42:19,121 --> 00:42:21,280
In fact, huge corporations.

574
00:42:21,332 --> 00:42:26,076
Furthermore, they're integrated with, and
sometimes owned by, even larger corporations,

575
00:42:26,127 --> 00:42:30,374
conglomerates, so, for example,
by Westinghouse, GE and so on.

576
00:42:35,885 --> 00:42:41,803
What I wanted to know was
how specifically the elites control the media.

577
00:42:41,848 --> 00:42:45,050
That's like asking,
"How do the elites control General Motors"?

578
00:42:46,477 --> 00:42:48,552
Why isn't that a question?

579
00:42:48,603 --> 00:42:53,099
I mean, General Motors is an institution of the
elites. They don't have to control it. They own it.

580
00:42:53,149 --> 00:42:55,639
Except I guess, at a certain level I think...

581
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:02,151
Like, I guess... I work with student press,
so I know, like, reporters and stuff...

582
00:43:02,198 --> 00:43:05,482
Elites don't control the student press,
but I'll tell you something -

583
00:43:05,534 --> 00:43:10,195
you try in the student press
to do anything that breaks out of conventions,

584
00:43:10,246 --> 00:43:14,159
and you're going to have the whole business
community around here down on your neck,

585
00:43:14,207 --> 00:43:17,291
and the university's going to get threatened,
and you know...

586
00:43:17,335 --> 00:43:20,169
Maybe nobody'll pay any attention to you.
That's possible.

587
00:43:20,212 --> 00:43:23,462
If you get to the point
where they don't stop paying attention to you,

588
00:43:23,507 --> 00:43:25,249
the pressures'll start coming.

589
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:28,999
Because there are people with power,
there are people who own the country,

590
00:43:29,052 --> 00:43:31,721
and they're not going to
let the country get out of control.

591
00:43:31,763 --> 00:43:33,970
What do you think about that?

592
00:43:34,016 --> 00:43:42,022
This is the old cabal theory that somewhere
there's a room with a baize-covered desk,

593
00:43:42,063 --> 00:43:45,347
and there are a bunch of capitalists
sitting around pulling strings.

594
00:43:45,399 --> 00:43:48,850
These rooms don't exist.
I hate to tell Noam Chomsky this.

595
00:43:48,902 --> 00:43:52,650
- You don't share that view?
- It's the most absolute rubbish I've ever heard.

596
00:43:52,697 --> 00:43:54,523
It's the fashion in the universities.

597
00:43:54,573 --> 00:43:58,901
It's patent nonsense,
and I think it's nothing but a fashion.

598
00:43:58,951 --> 00:44:01,157
It's a way that...

599
00:44:01,912 --> 00:44:04,913
intellectuals have of... of feeling like a clergy.

600
00:44:04,957 --> 00:44:07,198
There has to be something wrong.

601
00:44:59,251 --> 00:45:01,325
So, what we have in the first place

602
00:45:01,377 --> 00:45:05,160
is major corporations
which are parts of even bigger conglomerates.

603
00:45:05,213 --> 00:45:11,001
Now, like any other corporation, they...
they have a product which they sell to a market.

604
00:45:12,177 --> 00:45:15,878
The market is advertisers,
that is, other businesses.

605
00:45:15,931 --> 00:45:19,463
What keeps the media functioning
is not the audience.

606
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:23,928
They make money from their advertisers, and
remember, we're talking about the elite media,

607
00:45:23,979 --> 00:45:30,062
so they're trying to sell a good product,
a product which raises advertising rates.

608
00:45:30,108 --> 00:45:32,516
And ask your friends in the advertising industry.

609
00:45:32,568 --> 00:45:35,521
That means
that they want to adjust their audience

610
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:37,693
to the more elite and affluent audience.

611
00:45:37,739 --> 00:45:39,483
That raises advertising rates.

612
00:45:39,532 --> 00:45:43,660
So what you have is institutions, corporations -
big corporations -

613
00:45:43,702 --> 00:45:48,163
that are selling relatively privileged audiences
to other businesses.

614
00:45:48,206 --> 00:45:51,740
Well, what point of view
would you expect to come out of this?

615
00:45:52,376 --> 00:45:55,413
Without any further assumptions,
what you'd predict is

616
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:58,913
that what comes out is a picture of the world,
a perception of the world,

617
00:45:58,964 --> 00:46:02,582
that satisfies the needs,
and the interests, and the perceptions

618
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:06,252
of the sellers, the buyers, and the product.

619
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:12,133
Now, there are many other factors
that press in the same direction.

620
00:46:12,183 --> 00:46:16,097
If people try to enter the system
who don't have that point of view,

621
00:46:16,145 --> 00:46:18,932
they're likely to be excluded
somewhere along the way.

622
00:46:18,982 --> 00:46:23,606
Ater all, no institution is going to
happily design a mechanism to self-destruct.

623
00:46:23,651 --> 00:46:28,312
That's not the way institutions function,
so they all work to exclude, or marginalise,

624
00:46:28,363 --> 00:46:32,063
or eliminate dissenting voices,
or alternative perspectives and so on

625
00:46:32,117 --> 00:46:33,740
because they're dysfunctional.

626
00:46:33,784 --> 00:46:36,239
They're dysfunctional to the institution itself.

627
00:46:36,286 --> 00:46:40,615
Do you think you've escaped
the ideological indoctrination

628
00:46:40,665 --> 00:46:43,121
of the media and society that you grew up in?

629
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:45,491
Have I? Oten not.

630
00:46:45,543 --> 00:46:47,121
I mean, when I look back,

631
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:52,080
and think of the things that I haven't done
that I should have done, it's...

632
00:46:52,132 --> 00:46:54,208
it's very...

633
00:46:55,051 --> 00:46:56,462
it's...

634
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,219
not a pleasant experience.

635
00:46:58,263 --> 00:47:01,345
So, what's the story
of young Noam in the school yard?

636
00:47:01,389 --> 00:47:02,588
Yeah, another...

637
00:47:02,641 --> 00:47:04,514
I mean, that was a personal thing for me.

638
00:47:04,559 --> 00:47:07,724
I don't know why it should interest anyone else,
but I do remember...

639
00:47:07,769 --> 00:47:11,185
- You drew certain conclusions.
- It had a big influence on me.

640
00:47:11,231 --> 00:47:14,018
I remember when I was about six, I guess,

641
00:47:14,067 --> 00:47:18,858
first grade, there was the standard fat kid
who everybody made fun of,

642
00:47:18,904 --> 00:47:23,529
and I remember in the school yard,
he was on a...

643
00:47:24,575 --> 00:47:28,442
you know, standing right outside
the school classroom,

644
00:47:28,495 --> 00:47:32,159
and a bunch of kids outside sort of taunting him,
and... you know, and so on,

645
00:47:32,206 --> 00:47:34,993
and one of the kids actually brought over
his older brother

646
00:47:35,042 --> 00:47:37,118
from third grade instead of first grade.

647
00:47:37,169 --> 00:47:38,544
Big kid.

648
00:47:38,587 --> 00:47:40,745
And he was going to beat him up or something,

649
00:47:40,796 --> 00:47:43,466
and I remember going up to stand next to him,

650
00:47:43,508 --> 00:47:46,626
feeling somebody ought to... help him,

651
00:47:46,676 --> 00:47:49,297
and I did for a while, and then I got scared,

652
00:47:49,345 --> 00:47:53,389
and I went away,
and I was very much ashamed of it aterwards,

653
00:47:53,432 --> 00:47:56,930
and sort of felt, you know...
"I'm not going to do that again."

654
00:47:59,019 --> 00:48:03,929
That's a feeling that's stuck with me -
you should stick with the underdog.

655
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:08,018
And the shame remained.
I should have stayed there.

656
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:14,567
You were already established, you were a
professor at MIT, you'd made a reputation,

657
00:48:14,616 --> 00:48:16,407
you had a terrific career ahead of you.

658
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:20,150
You decided to become a political activist.

659
00:48:20,203 --> 00:48:24,746
Now, here is a classic case of somebody the
institution does not seem to have filtered out.

660
00:48:24,791 --> 00:48:27,115
I mean, you were a good boy up until then,
were you?

661
00:48:27,167 --> 00:48:29,373
Or you'd always been a slight rebel?

662
00:48:29,418 --> 00:48:32,205
Pretty much. I had been pretty much outside.

663
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:36,298
You felt isolated and out of
sympathy with the currents of American life,

664
00:48:36,341 --> 00:48:37,621
but a lot of people do that.

665
00:48:37,675 --> 00:48:40,842
Suddenly, in 1964,
you decide, "I have to do something about this".

666
00:48:40,887 --> 00:48:42,214
What made you do that?

667
00:48:42,262 --> 00:48:45,761
That was a very conscious,
and a very uncomfortable, decision,

668
00:48:45,807 --> 00:48:48,345
because I knew
what the consequences would be.

669
00:48:48,393 --> 00:48:50,468
I was in a very favourable position.

670
00:48:50,519 --> 00:48:52,595
I had the kind of work I liked,

671
00:48:52,646 --> 00:48:54,852
we had a lively, exciting department,

672
00:48:54,897 --> 00:48:57,389
the field was going well, personal life was fine,

673
00:48:57,442 --> 00:48:59,812
I was living in a nice place, children growing up.

674
00:48:59,859 --> 00:49:02,528
Everything looked perfect,
and I knew I was giving it up,

675
00:49:02,570 --> 00:49:05,240
and at that time, remember,
it was not just giving talks.

676
00:49:05,281 --> 00:49:07,605
I became involved right away in resistance,

677
00:49:07,658 --> 00:49:11,323
and I expected to spend years in jail,
and came very close to it.

678
00:49:11,370 --> 00:49:14,322
In fact,
my wife went back to graduate school in part

679
00:49:14,371 --> 00:49:16,993
as we assumed
she would have to support the children.

680
00:49:17,041 --> 00:49:18,618
These were the expectations.

681
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:28,171
And I recognised
that if I returned to these interests

682
00:49:28,216 --> 00:49:30,623
which were the dominant interests
of my own youth,

683
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,965
life would become very uncomfortable.

684
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:36,926
Because I know that in the United States
you don't get sent to psychiatric prison,

685
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:39,428
and they don't send a death squad ater you
and so on,

686
00:49:39,475 --> 00:49:43,472
but there are definite penalties
for breaking the rules.

687
00:49:44,521 --> 00:49:46,228
So these were real decisions,

688
00:49:46,272 --> 00:49:52,310
and it simply seemed at that point
that it was just hopelessly immoral not to.

689
00:49:54,946 --> 00:49:57,733
I'm Noam Chomsky, I'm on the faculty at MIT,

690
00:49:57,782 --> 00:50:01,232
and I've been getting
more and more heavily involved

691
00:50:01,284 --> 00:50:03,739
in anti-war activities for the last few years.

692
00:50:16,422 --> 00:50:20,418
Beginning with writing articles,
and making speeches,

693
00:50:20,466 --> 00:50:22,755
speaking to congressmen
and that sort of thing,

694
00:50:22,802 --> 00:50:29,717
and gradually getting involved more and more
directly in resistance activities of various sorts.

695
00:50:29,766 --> 00:50:33,714
I've come to the feeling myself
that the most effective form of political action

696
00:50:33,769 --> 00:50:39,439
that is open to a responsible
and concerned citizen at the moment

697
00:50:39,483 --> 00:50:43,727
is action that really involves direct resistance,

698
00:50:43,776 --> 00:50:48,272
refusal to take part in
what I think are war crimes,

699
00:50:48,322 --> 00:50:52,616
to raise the domestic cost
of American aggression overseas

700
00:50:52,660 --> 00:50:58,530
through non-participation, and support
for those who are refusing to take part,

701
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:01,415
in particular,
drat resistance throughout the country.

702
00:51:10,924 --> 00:51:16,000
I think that we can see quite clearly
some very, very serious defects and flaws

703
00:51:16,053 --> 00:51:19,006
in our society,
our level of culture, our institutions

704
00:51:19,055 --> 00:51:20,882
which are going to have to be corrected

705
00:51:20,932 --> 00:51:24,265
by operating outside of the framework
that is commonly accepted.

706
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:28,175
I think we're going to have to
find new ways of political action.

707
00:51:54,458 --> 00:51:58,705
I rejoice in your disposition
to argue the Vietnam question,

708
00:51:58,754 --> 00:52:03,214
especially when I recognise
what an act of self-control this must involve.

709
00:52:03,258 --> 00:52:05,582
It really does.
- You're doing very well.

710
00:52:05,634 --> 00:52:09,002
- You're doing very well.
- I lose my temper. Maybe not tonight.

711
00:52:09,053 --> 00:52:11,129
Maybe not tonight...

712
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:13,885
because if you would
I'd smash you in the goddamn face.

713
00:52:16,268 --> 00:52:18,675
That's a good reason for not losing your temper.

714
00:52:18,728 --> 00:52:25,441
You say, "The war is simply an obscenity,
a depraved act by weak and miserable men."

715
00:52:25,484 --> 00:52:27,808
Including all of us.

716
00:52:27,861 --> 00:52:30,530
Including myself. That's the next sentence.

717
00:52:30,570 --> 00:52:32,693
Oh, sure, sure, sure.

718
00:52:32,739 --> 00:52:35,859
Because you count everybody
in the company of the guilty.

719
00:52:35,908 --> 00:52:39,442
- I think that's true in this case.
- It's a theological observation.

720
00:52:39,494 --> 00:52:40,740
No, I don't think so.

721
00:52:40,787 --> 00:52:44,785
If everybody's guilty of everything,
then nobody's guilty of anything.

722
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:46,208
No, I don't believe that.

723
00:52:46,251 --> 00:52:49,749
I think the point that I'm trying to make,
and I think ought to be made,

724
00:52:49,794 --> 00:52:52,250
is that the real...

725
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:55,546
at least to me -
I say this elsewhere in the book -

726
00:52:55,591 --> 00:53:02,126
what seems to me a very, in a sense, terrifying
aspect of our society and other societies

727
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:08,182
is the equanimity and the detachment
with which sane, reasonable, sensible people

728
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:09,969
can observe such events.

729
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:14,976
I think that's more terrifying than
the occasional Hitler or LeMay that crops up.

730
00:53:15,023 --> 00:53:18,474
These people would not be able
to operate were it not for the...

731
00:53:18,526 --> 00:53:20,068
this apathy and equanimity,

732
00:53:20,111 --> 00:53:22,316
and therefore I think that it's in some sense

733
00:53:22,362 --> 00:53:29,740
the sane, and reasonable, and tolerant people
who share a very serious burden of guilt

734
00:53:29,786 --> 00:53:33,154
that they very easily
throw on the shoulders of others

735
00:53:33,205 --> 00:53:35,956
who seem more extreme and more violent.

736
00:53:38,959 --> 00:53:44,878
12 million pounds of confetti dropped into
New York City's so-called Canyon of Heroes.

737
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:49,464
Americans were officially welcoming
the troops home from the Persian Gulf war.

738
00:53:49,509 --> 00:53:51,715
It worked out really great for us.

739
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:59,387
It just goes to show that we're a mighty nation,
and we'll be there no matter what comes along.

740
00:53:59,434 --> 00:54:03,894
It's the strongest country in the world,
and you got to be glad to live here.

741
00:54:03,938 --> 00:54:08,100
So, tell me what you feel
about media coverage of the war.

742
00:54:08,149 --> 00:54:13,189
It was good. It got to be a bit much ater a while,
but I guess it was good to know everything.

743
00:54:13,236 --> 00:54:15,809
In Vietnam you didn't know a lot
that was going on,

744
00:54:15,864 --> 00:54:19,363
but here you're pretty much
up to the moment on everything,

745
00:54:19,409 --> 00:54:22,029
so... I guess it was good to be informed.

746
00:54:23,787 --> 00:54:27,831
For the first time,
because of technology, we have the ability

747
00:54:27,874 --> 00:54:31,574
to be live from many locations
around the globe,

748
00:54:31,626 --> 00:54:35,754
and because of the format -
an all-news network -

749
00:54:35,797 --> 00:54:40,458
we can spend whatever time is necessary
to bring the viewer

750
00:54:40,509 --> 00:54:44,920
the complete context
of that day's portion of the story.

751
00:54:48,264 --> 00:54:55,511
And by context, I mean the institutional memory
that is critical to understand why and how,

752
00:54:55,562 --> 00:55:00,603
and that's those who are analysts,
and do commentary,

753
00:55:00,650 --> 00:55:03,105
and those who can explain.

754
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,395
Slug that last piece...

755
00:55:08,531 --> 00:55:12,860
...lTN-lsrael Post War.

756
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:16,657
David Brinkley once said
that you step in front of the camera,

757
00:55:16,704 --> 00:55:19,374
and you get out of news business,
and into show business,

758
00:55:19,414 --> 00:55:24,656
but nonetheless
that should not in any way subtract or obscure

759
00:55:24,711 --> 00:55:27,711
the need for the basic standards
of good journalism.

760
00:55:27,755 --> 00:55:31,289
Hang tight. Let me
give you a lead for Salinger right now, OK?

761
00:55:32,175 --> 00:55:36,671
President Bush
and Prime Minister Major have...

762
00:55:37,722 --> 00:55:41,634
...closed, or have almost rejected...

763
00:55:41,682 --> 00:55:46,095
the Soviet peace talk...
peace efforts in Saudi Arabia.

764
00:55:46,145 --> 00:55:48,765
The door is being let open.

765
00:55:48,813 --> 00:55:52,514
Rick Salinger is standing by live in Riyad.

766
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:54,974
- All but closed.
- Yeah. All but closed.

767
00:55:55,027 --> 00:55:56,402
Right.

768
00:55:56,444 --> 00:56:01,984
Accuracy, speed, a fair approach,
honesty and integrity within the reporter

769
00:56:02,033 --> 00:56:05,151
to try and bring the truth,
whatever the truth may be.

770
00:56:05,994 --> 00:56:07,950
Going to war is a serious business.

771
00:56:07,995 --> 00:56:13,237
In a totalitarian society, the dictator just says,
"We're going to war", and everybody marches.

772
00:56:13,292 --> 00:56:16,458
And with this weapon
of human brotherhood in our hands

773
00:56:16,503 --> 00:56:21,922
we are seeing the war for men's minds
not as a battle of truth against lies,

774
00:56:21,965 --> 00:56:26,259
but as a lasting alliance pledged in faith
with all those millions driving forward

775
00:56:26,303 --> 00:56:31,093
to create the true new order-
the world order of the people first,

776
00:56:31,139 --> 00:56:33,262
the people before all.

777
00:56:33,308 --> 00:56:38,763
3In a democratic society, the theory
is, if the political leadership is committed to war

778
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:42,856
they present reasons, and they've got
a very heavy burden of proof to meet.

779
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:46,563
Because a war is a very catastrophic affair,
as it's been proved to be.

780
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:49,315
Now, the role of the media at that point is to...

781
00:56:49,363 --> 00:56:52,778
is to present the relevant background.

782
00:56:52,824 --> 00:56:55,943
For example,
the possibilities of peaceful settlement,

783
00:56:55,993 --> 00:56:58,401
such as what they may be,
have to be presented,

784
00:56:58,454 --> 00:57:06,080
and then to offer a forum... in fact encourage
a forum of debate over this very dread decision

785
00:57:06,126 --> 00:57:09,541
to go to war, and in this case
kill hundreds of thousands of people,

786
00:57:09,586 --> 00:57:11,662
and leave two countries wrecked, and so on.

787
00:57:11,713 --> 00:57:13,623
That never happened.

788
00:57:13,674 --> 00:57:15,215
There was never...

789
00:57:15,257 --> 00:57:16,800
Well, you know, when I say never,

790
00:57:16,843 --> 00:57:22,962
I mean 99.9 per cent of the discussion
excluded the option of a peaceful settlement.

791
00:57:23,014 --> 00:57:25,635
To Washington's Office of War Information

792
00:57:25,683 --> 00:57:29,727
falls one of the most vital and constructive tasks
of this war.

793
00:57:29,770 --> 00:57:31,845
This is a people's war,

794
00:57:31,896 --> 00:57:36,475
and to win it, the people ought to
know as much about it as they can.

795
00:57:36,526 --> 00:57:40,985
This office will do its best to tell the truth,
and nothing but the truth,

796
00:57:41,029 --> 00:57:42,772
both at home and abroad.

797
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:46,024
The first weapon
in this worldwide strategy of proof

798
00:57:46,074 --> 00:57:49,193
is the great machine of information
represented by the free press

799
00:57:49,243 --> 00:57:53,407
with its powers of moulding public thought,
and leading public action,

800
00:57:53,456 --> 00:57:56,704
with all its lifelines
for the exchange of new ideas

801
00:57:56,749 --> 00:57:59,786
between fighting nations
spread across the earth.

802
00:58:02,129 --> 00:58:05,793
Every time Bush would appear
and say, "There will be no negotiations",

803
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:08,960
there would be a hundred editorials
the next day

804
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:12,259
lauding him
for going the last mile for diplomacy.

805
00:58:12,304 --> 00:58:16,681
If he said, "You can't reward an aggressor",
instead of cracking up in ridicule

806
00:58:16,725 --> 00:58:20,804
the way people did in civilised sectors
of the world like the whole Third World,

807
00:58:20,853 --> 00:58:24,684
the media still...
"man of fantastic principle", you know.

808
00:58:24,731 --> 00:58:27,648
The invader of Panama, the only head of state

809
00:58:27,691 --> 00:58:30,941
who stands condemned
for aggression in the world,

810
00:58:30,986 --> 00:58:33,902
the guy who was head of the CIA
during the Timor aggression,

811
00:58:33,946 --> 00:58:37,196
he says, "Aggressors can't be rewarded",
the media just applaud it.

812
00:58:37,241 --> 00:58:42,446
The motion picture industry with
its worldwide organisation of newsreel crews,

813
00:58:42,494 --> 00:58:45,661
invaluable for bringing into vivid focus

814
00:58:45,706 --> 00:58:48,706
the background drama
and perspectives of the war.

815
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:53,794
Mobilised too in this all-out struggle
for men's minds are the radio networks,

816
00:58:53,837 --> 00:58:58,297
with all their experience in the swift reporting
of great occasions and events.

817
00:59:00,176 --> 00:59:03,509
From every strategic centre
and frontline stronghold

818
00:59:03,554 --> 00:59:06,507
their reporters are sending back
the lessons of new tactics,

819
00:59:06,556 --> 00:59:08,632
new ways of war.

820
00:59:08,683 --> 00:59:13,177
The result was it's a media war.
There's tremendous fakery all along the line.

821
00:59:13,227 --> 00:59:15,848
The UN is finally living up to its mission.

822
00:59:16,397 --> 00:59:18,935
"A wondrous sea change",
The New York Times told us.

823
00:59:18,983 --> 00:59:21,270
The only wondrous sea change
was that for once

824
00:59:21,317 --> 00:59:25,397
the United States didn't veto a Security Council
Resolution against aggression.

825
00:59:27,156 --> 00:59:29,907
People don't want a war
unless you have to have one,

826
00:59:29,949 --> 00:59:32,108
and would've known
you don't have to have one.

827
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:34,283
The media kept people from knowing that,

828
00:59:34,329 --> 00:59:37,826
and that means we went to war
very much in the manner of a totalitarian state,

829
00:59:37,872 --> 00:59:39,746
thanks to the media subservience.

830
00:59:39,791 --> 00:59:41,534
That's the big story.

831
00:59:48,214 --> 00:59:51,748
Now, remember I'm not talking about
a small radio station in Laramie.

832
00:59:51,801 --> 00:59:55,879
I'm talking about
the national agenda-setting media.

833
00:59:55,928 --> 00:59:58,502
If you run a radio news show in Laramie,

834
00:59:58,557 --> 01:00:02,932
chances are very strong that you pick up
what was in The Times that morning,

835
01:00:02,976 --> 01:00:04,518
and you decide that's the news.

836
01:00:04,561 --> 01:00:07,562
In fact, if you follow the AP wires,
you find it in the aternoon.

837
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:11,305
They send across tomorrow's front page
of The New York Times.

838
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:13,647
That's so that everybody knows
what the news is.

839
01:00:13,694 --> 01:00:18,235
The perceptions and perspectives
and so on are sort of transmitted down,

840
01:00:18,280 --> 01:00:23,072
not to the precise detail, but the general picture
is pretty much transmitted elsewhere.

841
01:00:25,202 --> 01:00:28,322
The foreign news comes here
to the Foreign News desk.

842
01:00:28,372 --> 01:00:30,448
The editor is Bob Hanley.

843
01:00:31,374 --> 01:00:35,418
Bob, I suppose you get far more foreign news
than you can possibly use in the paper.

844
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:39,587
Yes, we do. We get a great deal more
than we can accommodate in a day.

845
01:00:39,630 --> 01:00:41,540
Your job is to weed it out, I suppose.

846
01:00:41,590 --> 01:00:44,626
This is the selection centre, as it were,

847
01:00:44,677 --> 01:00:47,346
and when I have selected it

848
01:00:47,387 --> 01:00:52,547
I pass it across the desk
to one or the other of the sub-editors.

849
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:57,675
It comes back to me,
and on this chart I design the page.

850
01:00:57,728 --> 01:00:59,804
That is page one and page two.

851
01:00:59,855 --> 01:01:01,646
Fine, Bob. Thank you very much.

852
01:01:06,903 --> 01:01:09,738
- Why do you want to make a film about Media?
- Well...

853
01:01:09,780 --> 01:01:11,487
Such a nice, quiet town.

854
01:01:11,531 --> 01:01:13,405
It's a beautiful town.

855
01:01:13,449 --> 01:01:17,198
We're making a film about the mass media,
so we thought what a good place to come.

856
01:01:17,245 --> 01:01:18,869
Want to know where they got the name?

857
01:01:18,913 --> 01:01:21,403
Maybe you could start
by introducing yourself.

858
01:01:21,456 --> 01:01:23,329
Yes, I'm Bodhon Senkow.

859
01:01:23,374 --> 01:01:27,322
I'm the main street manager and executive
director of the Media Business Authority,

860
01:01:27,377 --> 01:01:30,461
and we are in Media, Delaware County,

861
01:01:30,505 --> 01:01:32,912
in the southeastern part of Pennsylvania.

862
01:01:32,965 --> 01:01:36,215
Media is called "Everybody's hometown".

863
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:40,505
The motto was developed
as a way to promote the community.

864
01:01:40,555 --> 01:01:43,092
We're a very high
promotion-conscious community.

865
01:01:44,641 --> 01:01:48,223
When you walk through Media,
you'll be treated very well,

866
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:52,847
and you find that people have taken the idea
of being everybody's hometown to heart.

867
01:01:52,898 --> 01:01:55,567
The local paper, The Talk of the Town...

868
01:01:55,609 --> 01:01:57,186
The Town Talk.

869
01:01:57,818 --> 01:01:59,940
- Do you read that?
- Yes, I read The Town Talk.

870
01:01:59,986 --> 01:02:03,771
What do you think the difference is between
The Wall Street Journal and The Talk?

871
01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:06,492
Well, I mean, The Town Talk
is completely local news,

872
01:02:06,534 --> 01:02:09,321
and it's fun, it's nice to read, it's interesting.

873
01:02:09,370 --> 01:02:13,533
You read about your neighbours, see what's
going on in the district, and things like that.

874
01:02:13,582 --> 01:02:17,364
We're in business to make bucks,
just like the big daily newspapers,

875
01:02:17,417 --> 01:02:19,909
and like the big radio stations,
and we do quite well,

876
01:02:19,961 --> 01:02:22,416
and rightfully so, cos we work very hard at it.

877
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:25,998
I just wanna show you a copy of the paper here,
the way it is this week.

878
01:02:26,050 --> 01:02:28,801
It's plastic-wrapped on all four sides.

879
01:02:28,844 --> 01:02:32,840
Weatherproof,
and hung on everybody's front door.

880
01:02:32,888 --> 01:02:38,011
And many times you'll find this paper runs
well over 100 pages a week.

881
01:02:38,058 --> 01:02:40,265
You have to remember there are five editions.

882
01:02:40,311 --> 01:02:42,980
This happens to be
the Central Delaware County edition,

883
01:02:43,021 --> 01:02:45,807
which is the edition
that covers Media, Pennsylvania.

884
01:02:45,857 --> 01:02:48,977
What you see here
is the advertising and composition department.

885
01:02:49,027 --> 01:02:51,103
- Say hello, guys, will you?
- Hi.

886
01:02:52,154 --> 01:02:56,447
And what we're doing now is we're putting
red dots, green dots, and yellow dots

887
01:02:56,491 --> 01:03:00,155
up on the map wherever there is a store.

888
01:03:00,202 --> 01:03:03,202
The red dots are the stores
that don't advertise with us at all.

889
01:03:03,246 --> 01:03:06,163
The green dots are the ones
that advertise with us every week,

890
01:03:06,207 --> 01:03:09,870
and the yellow dots
are the ones that run sporadically.

891
01:03:09,917 --> 01:03:13,037
Now, we have computer print-outs
of every one of these stores,

892
01:03:13,088 --> 01:03:17,215
and what we do is we take the print-outs
of all the red dots which are the bad guys,

893
01:03:17,257 --> 01:03:21,752
and our idea is to turn these red dots into yellow
dots, and turn the yellow dots into green dots,

894
01:03:21,803 --> 01:03:25,053
and eventually make them all green dots,
so 100 per cent of the stores

895
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:29,141
and 100 per cent of the merchants and service
people advertise in our paper every week.

896
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:31,093
That way, we won't have any more red dots.

897
01:03:31,144 --> 01:03:33,633
I guess there'll always be a few,
but I have high hopes

898
01:03:33,687 --> 01:03:36,641
there'll be a lot more green ones
than red when we're finished.

899
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:38,101
Hi, I'm Jim Morgan.

900
01:03:38,150 --> 01:03:41,315
I'm with the Corporate Relations Department
of The New York Times,

901
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:45,060
and I'm here to take you on a tour
of The New York Times, so... let's begin.

902
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:51,444
So, they're just taking audio in here, yeah.

903
01:03:51,493 --> 01:03:53,569
They're taking audio in here.

904
01:03:53,620 --> 01:03:57,486
Audio. No cameras, no still.
We went over this quite thoroughly.

905
01:03:57,540 --> 01:04:00,030
They don't even take a still camera in here.

906
01:04:01,918 --> 01:04:05,037
We're in the composing room.
This is where the pages are composed.

907
01:04:05,087 --> 01:04:06,830
This is the typographical area.

908
01:04:14,302 --> 01:04:19,807
This might seem big, but it is average.
In fact, below average.

909
01:04:19,849 --> 01:04:25,270
Our 60 per cent might include on some days
maybe...

910
01:04:25,313 --> 01:04:29,475
20 pages of classified advertising all to itself,

911
01:04:29,523 --> 01:04:33,473
where the rest of the newspaper
is weighted much heavier news to advertising,

912
01:04:33,527 --> 01:04:37,310
but the paper in its entirety every day,
large or small,

913
01:04:37,363 --> 01:04:39,854
is 60 ads, 40 news.

914
01:04:41,742 --> 01:04:44,493
Well, that completes our tour
of The New York Times,

915
01:04:44,536 --> 01:04:47,785
and I hope you found it informative, and...

916
01:04:48,831 --> 01:04:53,706
...I hope that you read The New York Times
every day of your life from now on.

917
01:04:57,546 --> 01:05:01,958
There are other media too
whose basic social role is quite different.

918
01:05:02,008 --> 01:05:03,835
It's diversion.

919
01:05:03,885 --> 01:05:10,004
There's the real mass media, the kinds
that are aimed at the guys who... Joe Six-pack.

920
01:05:10,056 --> 01:05:14,682
That kind. The purpose of those media
is just to dull people's brains.

921
01:05:14,727 --> 01:05:18,973
This is an over-simplification,
but for the 80 per cent or whatever they are,

922
01:05:19,022 --> 01:05:21,512
the main thing for them is to divert them,

923
01:05:21,565 --> 01:05:27,151
to get them to watch National Football League,
and to worry about the... you know...

924
01:05:27,195 --> 01:05:32,319
mother with child with six heads,
or whatever you pick up in the... you know...

925
01:05:32,366 --> 01:05:36,280
in the thing that you pick
up on the supermarket stands, and so on.

926
01:05:36,328 --> 01:05:41,452
Or, you know, look at astrology, or get involved
in fundamentalist stuff, or something.

927
01:05:41,499 --> 01:05:46,705
Just get them away, you know.
Get them away from things that matter.

928
01:05:46,753 --> 01:05:51,213
And for that,
it's important to reduce their capacity to think.

929
01:05:51,256 --> 01:05:55,169
The sports section is handled
in another special department.

930
01:05:55,217 --> 01:05:58,551
The sports reporter must be a specialist
in his knowledge of sports.

931
01:05:58,595 --> 01:06:04,050
He gets his story right at the sporting event,
and often sends it in to his paper play by play.

932
01:06:04,099 --> 01:06:05,807
Sports.

933
01:06:05,851 --> 01:06:10,347
That's another crucial example
of the indoctrination system in my view.

934
01:06:10,397 --> 01:06:15,057
For one thing, because it... you know,
it offers people something to pay attention to

935
01:06:15,109 --> 01:06:17,434
that's of no importance.

936
01:06:17,486 --> 01:06:20,604
- That keeps them from worrying about...

937
01:06:22,281 --> 01:06:25,447
...keeps them from worrying
about things that matter to their lives

938
01:06:25,492 --> 01:06:28,112
they might have some idea
about doing something about.

939
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:35,823
And in fact, it's striking to see the intelligence
that's used by ordinary people in sports.

940
01:06:35,875 --> 01:06:39,160
You listen to radio stations where people call in.

941
01:06:39,211 --> 01:06:41,584
They have the most exotic information

942
01:06:41,631 --> 01:06:44,334
and understanding
about all kinds of arcane issues,

943
01:06:44,382 --> 01:06:46,458
and the press undoubtedly does a lot with this.

944
01:06:46,509 --> 01:06:48,668
I remember in high school - I was pretty old -

945
01:06:48,720 --> 01:06:51,174
I suddenly asked myself at one point,

946
01:06:51,221 --> 01:06:55,004
"Why do I care
if my high school team wins the football game?"

947
01:06:55,057 --> 01:06:58,639
I mean, I don't know anybody on the team,
you know.

948
01:07:00,103 --> 01:07:03,223
It had nothing to do with me.
I mean, why am I cheering for my team?

949
01:07:03,273 --> 01:07:04,980
It doesn't make any sense.

950
01:07:06,024 --> 01:07:08,100
But the point is, it does make sense.

951
01:07:08,151 --> 01:07:12,018
It's a way of building up irrational attitudes
of submission to authority,

952
01:07:13,072 --> 01:07:18,029
and, you know, group cohesion behind...
you know, leadership elements.

953
01:07:18,076 --> 01:07:20,863
In fact, it's training in irrational jingoism.

954
01:07:20,912 --> 01:07:24,529
That's also a feature of competitive sports.
I think...

955
01:07:24,581 --> 01:07:29,207
If you look closely at these things,
I think, typically, they do have functions,

956
01:07:29,252 --> 01:07:33,000
and that's why
energy is devoted to supporting them,

957
01:07:33,047 --> 01:07:36,545
and creating a basis for them,
and advertisers are willing to pay for them.

958
01:07:40,469 --> 01:07:42,378
I'd like to ask you a question

959
01:07:42,429 --> 01:07:45,346
about the methodology
and study in the propaganda model,

960
01:07:45,390 --> 01:07:47,796
and how would one go about doing that?

961
01:07:47,849 --> 01:07:50,341
Well, there are a number of ways to proceed.

962
01:07:51,395 --> 01:07:56,601
One obvious way is to try to find
more or less paired examples.

963
01:07:57,649 --> 01:08:00,484
History doesn't offer true controlled
experiments,

964
01:08:00,527 --> 01:08:02,435
but it oten comes pretty close.

965
01:08:02,486 --> 01:08:07,942
So one can find atrocities or abuses of one sort

966
01:08:07,991 --> 01:08:12,487
that on the one hand are committed
by official enemies, and on the other hand

967
01:08:12,537 --> 01:08:17,493
are committed by friends and allies,
or by the favoured state itself.

968
01:08:17,540 --> 01:08:19,698
By the United States, in the US' case.

969
01:08:19,750 --> 01:08:23,000
The question is whether the media
accept the government framework,

970
01:08:23,045 --> 01:08:25,831
or whether they use the same agenda,
same set of questions,

971
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:29,047
the same criteria for dealing with the two cases

972
01:08:29,092 --> 01:08:31,665
as any honest outside observer would do.

973
01:08:31,719 --> 01:08:33,876
If you think America's involvement

974
01:08:33,928 --> 01:08:36,964
in the war in Southeast Asia is over, think again.

975
01:08:37,014 --> 01:08:41,474
The Khmer Rouge are the
most genocidal people on the face of the earth.

976
01:08:41,518 --> 01:08:44,187
Peter Jennings
Reporting From The Killing Fields.

977
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:46,055
Thursday.

978
01:08:46,105 --> 01:08:51,347
I mean, the great act of genocide
in the modern period is Pol Pot.

979
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:55,101
1975 to... through 1978.

980
01:08:55,154 --> 01:08:58,569
That atrocity...
I think it would be hard to find any example

981
01:08:58,615 --> 01:09:04,284
of a comparable outrage and outpouring of fury,
and so on and so forth,

982
01:09:04,328 --> 01:09:05,987
so that's one atrocity.

983
01:09:06,037 --> 01:09:10,165
It just happens that in that case,
history did set up a controlled experiment.

984
01:09:10,208 --> 01:09:12,698
Ever heard of a place called East Timor?

985
01:09:12,751 --> 01:09:14,827
- I can't say that I have.
- Where?

986
01:09:14,878 --> 01:09:16,954
- East Timor.
- No.

987
01:09:17,004 --> 01:09:20,503
Well, it happens that right at that time
there was another atrocity.

988
01:09:20,548 --> 01:09:23,669
Very similar in character,
but differing in one respect -

989
01:09:23,719 --> 01:09:26,506
we were responsible for it, not Pol Pot.

990
01:09:26,555 --> 01:09:29,223
Hello. I'm Louise Penney,
and this is Radio Noon.

991
01:09:29,265 --> 01:09:33,262
If you've been listening to the programme
fairly regularly over the last few months,

992
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:37,140
you'll know East Timor has come
into the conversation more than once,

993
01:09:37,187 --> 01:09:42,430
particularly when we were talking about foreign
aid, and also the war, and a new world order.

994
01:09:42,484 --> 01:09:46,147
People wondered why,
if the UN was serious about a new world order,

995
01:09:46,194 --> 01:09:48,650
no-one was doing anything to help East Timor.

996
01:09:48,697 --> 01:09:51,981
The area was invaded by Indonesia in 1975.

997
01:09:52,033 --> 01:09:55,781
There are reports of atrocities
against the Timorese people,

998
01:09:55,827 --> 01:09:58,662
and yet Canada and other nations
have consistently

999
01:09:58,705 --> 01:10:02,037
voted against UN Resolutions
to end the occupation.

1000
01:10:02,082 --> 01:10:04,788
Today, we're going to take a closer look
at East Timor,

1001
01:10:04,835 --> 01:10:09,080
what's happened to it, and why the international
community is doing nothing to help.

1002
01:10:10,047 --> 01:10:12,965
One of the people who have been most active
is Elaine Briére,

1003
01:10:13,009 --> 01:10:15,296
a photojournalist from British Columbia.

1004
01:10:15,343 --> 01:10:17,917
She's the founder of
the East Timor Alert Network,

1005
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:20,046
and she joins me in the studio now.

1006
01:10:20,097 --> 01:10:21,757
- Hello.
- Hi.

1007
01:10:21,807 --> 01:10:23,882
One tragedy compounding a tragedy

1008
01:10:23,933 --> 01:10:27,183
is that a lot of people
don't know much about East Timor.

1009
01:10:28,104 --> 01:10:31,305
- Where is it?
- East Timor is just north of Australia.

1010
01:10:31,356 --> 01:10:35,816
About 420 km, and it's right between
the Indian and Pacific oceans.

1011
01:10:35,860 --> 01:10:42,146
Just south of East Timor is a deep-water sea
lane perfect for US submarines to pass through.

1012
01:10:42,199 --> 01:10:44,404
There's also huge oil reserves there.

1013
01:10:48,036 --> 01:10:50,492
One of the unique things
about East Timor is that

1014
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:55,448
it's truly one of the last surviving
ancient civilisations in that part of the world.

1015
01:10:57,669 --> 01:11:01,583
The Timorese spoke
30 different languages and dialects

1016
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:04,168
amongst a group of 700,000 people.

1017
01:11:06,134 --> 01:11:11,044
Today less than five per cent of the world's
people live like the East Timorese.

1018
01:11:11,096 --> 01:11:16,470
Basically self-reliant, they live really outside
of the global economic system.

1019
01:11:20,854 --> 01:11:26,856
Small societies like the East Timorese are much
more democratic and much more egalitarian,

1020
01:11:26,900 --> 01:11:29,937
and there's much more sharing
of power and wealth.

1021
01:11:32,614 --> 01:11:36,741
Before the Indonesians invaded,
most people lived in small rural villages.

1022
01:11:42,955 --> 01:11:45,576
The old people in the village
were like the university.

1023
01:11:45,624 --> 01:11:49,242
They passed on tribal wisdom
from generation to generation.

1024
01:11:50,294 --> 01:11:55,419
Children grew up
in a safe, stimulating, nurturing environment.

1025
01:12:09,394 --> 01:12:14,220
A year ater I let East Timor, I was appalled
when I heard Indonesia had invaded.

1026
01:12:14,272 --> 01:12:18,732
It didn't want a small, independent country
setting an example for the region.

1027
01:12:21,320 --> 01:12:24,024
East Timor was a Portuguese colony.

1028
01:12:24,071 --> 01:12:28,484
Indonesia had no claim to it,
and in fact stated that they had no claim to it.

1029
01:12:29,534 --> 01:12:34,030
During the period of colonisation,
there was a good deal of politicisation

1030
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:36,156
that different groups developed.

1031
01:12:37,833 --> 01:12:40,999
A civil war broke out in August '75.

1032
01:12:56,055 --> 01:13:01,594
It ended up in a victory for Fretilin,
which was one of the groupings,

1033
01:13:01,643 --> 01:13:08,262
described as populist Catholic in character,
with some typical letist rhetoric.

1034
01:13:09,566 --> 01:13:12,566
Indonesia at once started intervening.

1035
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:16,311
What's the situation?
When did those ships come in?

1036
01:13:16,364 --> 01:13:18,771
They start arriving since Monday.

1037
01:13:18,823 --> 01:13:22,240
Six, seven boats together,
very close to our border.

1038
01:13:22,285 --> 01:13:26,365
They're not there just for fun.
They're preparing a massive operation.

1039
01:13:27,414 --> 01:13:31,875
Something happened here
last night that moved us very deeply.

1040
01:13:31,919 --> 01:13:34,491
It was so far outside our experience
as Australians

1041
01:13:34,545 --> 01:13:38,376
that we'll find it very difficult
to convey to you, but we'll try.

1042
01:13:39,716 --> 01:13:44,590
Sitting on woven mats under a thatched roof
in a hut with no walls

1043
01:13:44,636 --> 01:13:49,677
we were the target of a barrage of questioning
from men who know they may die tomorrow,

1044
01:13:49,724 --> 01:13:53,768
and cannot understand
why the rest of the world does not care.

1045
01:13:53,811 --> 01:13:55,353
That's all they want -

1046
01:13:55,396 --> 01:13:58,680
for the United Nations to care about
what is happening here.

1047
01:13:59,649 --> 01:14:02,435
The emotion here last night was so strong

1048
01:14:02,484 --> 01:14:06,694
that we, all three of us, felt we should
be able to reach out into the warm night air

1049
01:14:06,737 --> 01:14:08,315
and touch it.

1050
01:14:08,364 --> 01:14:12,526
Greg Shackleton, at an unnamed village
which we will remember forever

1051
01:14:12,575 --> 01:14:14,651
in Portuguese Timor.

1052
01:14:29,297 --> 01:14:32,713
Ford and Kissinger visited Jakarta,
I think it was December 5th.

1053
01:14:32,759 --> 01:14:37,752
We know that they had requested that
Indonesia delay the invasion until ater they let

1054
01:14:37,804 --> 01:14:39,761
because it would be too embarrassing.

1055
01:14:40,848 --> 01:14:45,344
And within hours, I think, ater they let,
the invasion took place on December 7th.

1056
01:14:45,393 --> 01:14:52,688
What happened on December 7th in 1975,
is just one of the great evil deeds of history.

1057
01:14:52,733 --> 01:14:56,777
Early in the morning
bombs begin dropping on Dili.

1058
01:14:56,820 --> 01:14:59,274
The number of troops that invaded Dili that day

1059
01:14:59,321 --> 01:15:02,607
almost outnumbered
the entire population of the town.

1060
01:15:02,658 --> 01:15:07,069
And for two or three weeks,
they just killed people.

1061
01:15:30,680 --> 01:15:35,674
This Council must consider Indonesian
aggression against East Timor

1062
01:15:35,726 --> 01:15:38,181
as the main issue of the discussion.

1063
01:15:38,228 --> 01:15:43,019
When the Indonesians invaded,
the UN reacted as it always does,

1064
01:15:43,065 --> 01:15:46,729
calling for sanctions and condemnation
and so on.

1065
01:15:46,776 --> 01:15:49,777
Various watered-down resolutions
were passed,

1066
01:15:49,820 --> 01:15:54,031
but the US were very clearly
not going to allow anything to work.

1067
01:16:04,749 --> 01:16:08,829
So the Timorese were fleeing into the jungles
by the thousands.

1068
01:16:08,878 --> 01:16:13,954
By late 1977, '78
Indonesia set up receiving centres

1069
01:16:14,007 --> 01:16:17,838
for those Timorese
who came out of the jungle waving white flags.

1070
01:16:17,885 --> 01:16:20,043
Those the Indonesians thought more educated,

1071
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:26,381
or suspected of belonging to Fretilin or other
opposition parties were immediately killed.

1072
01:16:26,433 --> 01:16:29,433
They took women aside,
and flew them off to Dili in helicopters

1073
01:16:29,477 --> 01:16:31,221
for use by the Indonesian soldiers.

1074
01:16:31,271 --> 01:16:33,843
They killed children and babies.

1075
01:16:35,273 --> 01:16:39,935
But in those days their main strategy
and their main weapon was starvation.

1076
01:16:43,321 --> 01:16:47,568
By 1978,
it was approaching really genocidal levels.

1077
01:16:47,617 --> 01:16:52,242
The church and other sources
estimated about 200,000 people killed.

1078
01:16:52,287 --> 01:16:56,285
The US backed it all the way.
The US provided 90 per cent of the arms.

1079
01:16:56,332 --> 01:17:00,708
Right ater the invasion,
arms shipments were stepped up.

1080
01:17:00,752 --> 01:17:04,536
When the Indonesians
actually began to run out of arms in 1978,

1081
01:17:04,590 --> 01:17:08,336
the Carter administration moved in
and increased arms sales,

1082
01:17:08,759 --> 01:17:10,881
and other western countries did the same.

1083
01:17:10,927 --> 01:17:13,252
Canada, England... Holland...

1084
01:17:13,304 --> 01:17:15,593
Everybody who could make a buck
was in there,

1085
01:17:15,640 --> 01:17:18,261
trying to make sure
they could kill more Timorese.

1086
01:17:19,309 --> 01:17:22,309
There is no western concern
for issues of aggression,

1087
01:17:22,353 --> 01:17:24,429
atrocities, human rights abuses and so on

1088
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:26,556
if there's a profit to be made from them.

1089
01:17:26,607 --> 01:17:30,141
Nothing could show it more clearly
than this case.

1090
01:17:32,611 --> 01:17:34,770
It wasn't that nobody had heard of East Timor.

1091
01:17:34,822 --> 01:17:36,898
Remember there was plenty of coverage

1092
01:17:36,948 --> 01:17:39,617
in The New York Times and elsewhere
before the invasion.

1093
01:17:40,660 --> 01:17:44,360
The reason was there was concern
over the break-up of the Portuguese empire

1094
01:17:44,413 --> 01:17:45,954
and what that would mean.

1095
01:17:45,997 --> 01:17:50,539
There was fear it would lead to independence,
or Russian influence, or whatever.

1096
01:17:50,584 --> 01:17:53,501
Ater the Indonesians invaded,
the coverage dropped.

1097
01:17:53,545 --> 01:17:56,380
There was some,
but it was strictly from the point of view

1098
01:17:56,422 --> 01:17:58,829
of the State Department
and Indonesian generals.

1099
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:00,957
Never a Timorese refugee.

1100
01:18:04,595 --> 01:18:08,639
As the atrocities reached their maximum peak
in 1978,

1101
01:18:08,682 --> 01:18:10,757
when it really was becoming genocidal,

1102
01:18:10,809 --> 01:18:13,763
coverage dropped to zero
in the United States and Canada,

1103
01:18:13,812 --> 01:18:15,888
the two countries I've looked at closely.

1104
01:18:15,939 --> 01:18:17,515
Literally dropped to zero.

1105
01:18:19,441 --> 01:18:26,106
All this was going on at exactly the same time
as the great protest of outrage over Cambodia.

1106
01:18:26,154 --> 01:18:28,989
The level of atrocities was comparable.

1107
01:18:29,032 --> 01:18:33,075
In relative terms
it was probably considerably higher in Timor.

1108
01:18:35,411 --> 01:18:40,867
It turns out that right in Cambodia in the
preceding years, 1970 through 1975,

1109
01:18:40,916 --> 01:18:44,450
there was also a comparable atrocity
for which we were responsible.

1110
01:18:49,381 --> 01:18:52,050
The major US attack against Cambodia

1111
01:18:52,092 --> 01:18:54,962
started with the bombings of the early 1970s.

1112
01:18:55,011 --> 01:18:57,762
They reached a peak in 1973,

1113
01:18:57,804 --> 01:19:00,011
and they continued up till 1975.

1114
01:19:00,057 --> 01:19:02,844
They were directed against inner Cambodia.

1115
01:19:02,893 --> 01:19:06,557
Very little is known about them,
because the media wanted it to be secret.

1116
01:19:06,603 --> 01:19:10,102
They knew it was going on. They just
didn't want to know what was happening.

1117
01:19:12,274 --> 01:19:16,437
The CIA estimates about 600,000 killed
during that five-year period,

1118
01:19:16,486 --> 01:19:20,779
which is mostly either US bombing,
or a US-sponsored war.

1119
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:24,441
So that's pretty significant killing.

1120
01:19:24,494 --> 01:19:27,328
Also, the conditions
in which it let Cambodia were such

1121
01:19:27,369 --> 01:19:32,162
that high US officials predicted that about
a million people would die in the atermath

1122
01:19:32,208 --> 01:19:36,453
just from hunger and disease
because of the wreckage of the country.

1123
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:41,253
Pretty good evidence
from US government and scholarly sources

1124
01:19:41,298 --> 01:19:45,710
that the intense bombardment
was a significant force - maybe a critical force -

1125
01:19:45,760 --> 01:19:50,421
in building up peasant support for the Khmer
Rouge who were a pretty marginal element.

1126
01:19:50,472 --> 01:19:52,547
Well, that's just the wrong story.

1127
01:19:53,516 --> 01:19:55,390
Ater 1975,

1128
01:19:55,435 --> 01:19:58,104
atrocities continued,
and that became the right story -

1129
01:19:58,145 --> 01:20:00,433
now they're being carried out by the bad guys.

1130
01:20:01,481 --> 01:20:03,308
Well, it was bad enough.

1131
01:20:03,358 --> 01:20:07,437
In fact, current estimates are... well, they vary.

1132
01:20:07,486 --> 01:20:10,819
The CIA claim 50,000 to 100,000 people killed,

1133
01:20:10,864 --> 01:20:15,110
and maybe another million or so
who died one way or another.

1134
01:20:17,035 --> 01:20:20,902
Michael Vickery is the one person
who's given a really close, detailed analysis.

1135
01:20:20,955 --> 01:20:24,868
His figure is maybe
750,000 deaths above the normal.

1136
01:20:24,916 --> 01:20:29,910
Others like Ben Kiernan suggest higher figures,
but so far without a detailed analysis.

1137
01:20:29,963 --> 01:20:31,456
Anyway, it was terrible.

1138
01:20:31,505 --> 01:20:32,833
No doubt about it.

1139
01:20:32,881 --> 01:20:35,965
Although the atrocities - the real atrocities -
were bad enough,

1140
01:20:36,009 --> 01:20:39,459
they weren't quite good enough
for the purposes needed.

1141
01:20:39,511 --> 01:20:42,678
Within a few weeks
ater the Khmer Rouge takeover,

1142
01:20:42,723 --> 01:20:45,474
The New York Times
was already accusing them of genocide.

1143
01:20:46,600 --> 01:20:50,763
At that point, maybe a couple of hundred
or a few thousand people had been killed.

1144
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:55,389
And from then on,
it was a drum beat, a chorus of genocide.

1145
01:21:02,488 --> 01:21:08,857
The big bestseller on Cambodia and Pol Pot
is called Murder of a Gentle Land.

1146
01:21:08,911 --> 01:21:14,116
Up until April 17th, 1975,
it was a gentle land of peaceful, smiling people,

1147
01:21:14,164 --> 01:21:17,201
and ater that some horrible holocaust
took place.

1148
01:21:18,668 --> 01:21:23,163
Very quickly,
a figure of two million killed was hit upon.

1149
01:21:24,048 --> 01:21:26,834
In fact,
what was claimed was that the Khmer Rouge

1150
01:21:26,883 --> 01:21:29,291
boast of having murdered two million people.

1151
01:21:30,511 --> 01:21:31,887
Facts are very dramatic.

1152
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:35,712
In the case of
atrocities committed by the official enemy,

1153
01:21:35,765 --> 01:21:41,388
extraordinary show of outrage,
exaggeration, no evidence required.

1154
01:21:41,436 --> 01:21:44,555
Faked photographs are fine, anything goes.

1155
01:21:44,605 --> 01:21:46,681
Also a vast amount of lying.

1156
01:21:47,566 --> 01:21:51,398
I mean, an amount of lying
that would have made Stalin cringe.

1157
01:21:52,862 --> 01:21:55,353
It was fraudulent,
and we know that it was fraudulent

1158
01:21:55,406 --> 01:21:58,359
by looking at the response
to comparable atrocities

1159
01:21:58,408 --> 01:22:00,614
for which the United States was responsible.

1160
01:22:03,454 --> 01:22:08,080
Early '70s Cambodia, and Timor too -
very closely paired examples.

1161
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:11,491
Well, the media response was quite dramatic.
