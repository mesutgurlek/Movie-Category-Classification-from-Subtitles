1
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:50,153
Nice shot, Ham.

2
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,750
I drew it a little to the left.

3
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:54,637
It's 15 feet from the goddamn hole.

4
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,630
I miscalculated the wind
by a couple knots.

5
00:00:57,720 --> 00:00:59,278
Give me a break.

6
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,873
Well, you know,
it's all a matter of degrees.

7
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,033
Difference between the big money
and not making the cut is razor-thin.

8
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,237
Well, I wasn't thinking about
qualifying for the Masters, you know.

9
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,470
Kind of had my sights set on the NBA.

11
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:25,795
Well, your hook shot's working, Scotty.

12
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,269
Nice shot.

13
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,596
What do you think I'm doing wrong here?

14
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,838
I think you're standing
too close to the ball.

15
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,313
Yeah, pretty bad, huh?

16
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,630
After you hit it. Yeah?

17
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,551
They want you at Ops right away, sir.

18
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,792
Russian tanks,
8-inch guns, and APCs.

19
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,958
Seventh Air Force intelligence
has been indicating the possibility

20
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,713
of a North Vietnamese VC offensive.

21
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,074
Now these photos confirm it.

22
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,675
NVA troops moving down
the Ho Chi Minh Trail,

23
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:40,639
south of the DMZ near Quang Tri.

24
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,759
Now they'll combine with Charlie
and try to hit us hard,

25
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,910
probably in several places at once.

26
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,558
-Glad you could make it, Colonel.
-Sorry, sir.

27
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:56,635
Strategic Air Command
is putting everything it's got in the air

28
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,553
two days from now, and is just gonna
clobber the hell out of them.

29
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,758
If we don't stop their movement,
or at least slow it down to a trickle,

30
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,437
our ground troops
are going to take heavy casualties.

31
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,198
Now, our job remains the same.

32
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,750
Fly alongside the bombers, throw down
your electronic smoke screens,

33
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,068
jam the missile radars.

34
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,039
Sir? Why don't we put
our surveillance aircraft up there first, sir?

35
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:23,476
Have them fly the same route the big boys
are gonna fly on their scheduled run.

36
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,235
Missile reaction can be recorded,
launch sites plotted.

37
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,710
Send the fighter jocks in there,
just knock the hell out of them.

38
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,917
I really appreciate you volunteering us
for this flight, Ham.

39
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,639
I didn't think you had your sights set
on being a full bird.

40
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,996
I got my sights set on a condo
on the seventh fairway

41
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,355
at Tucson National.

42
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,398
Six months from now,
that's where the old lady and me will be.

43
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,233
That sounds awfully exciting.

44
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,437
You think that's exciting?
You should see the deck furniture.

46
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,958
Mark, start your music.

48
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,754
I've got a solid growl.

49
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,400
SAM on scope. I confirm a launch.

50
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,708
I got him.

51
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:35,230
Damn it, I didn't think they had SAMs
this far south.

52
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:37,072
Well, that's why we're here.

53
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,632
Go back and give them the bad news.

54
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,869
I've got another one.

55
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,110
SAM on scope, two salvo three.

56
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,672
I'm changing frequencies.

57
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,876
I got one. Hold steady.

58
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,112
-Got two.
-Got one visual.

59
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:52,269
Break left! Break left!

61
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,879
It's tracking us!

62
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:01,671
We're hit!

63
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:04,228
-We're hit! We're hit!
-Going down!

64
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:05,799
Fuck, we're going down!

65
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,438
We're burning up!

66
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,919
Son of a bitch!

67
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,958
Victor 1. Hit by SAM. Mayday, mayday!

68
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,349
I've lost it. Crew eject! Crew eject!

69
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,078
-I can't get out!
-Get out of here, Scott!

70
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,151
Victor 1, I'm hit in the tail!

71
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,708
-Punch out, Ham. Punch out!
-Come on, Scotty, let's get out!

72
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,438
-Right behind you!
-Come on!

73
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,748
Mayday, mayday!

74
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,838
Punch out, Scotty! Somebody punch out!

75
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:53,478
Recon pilots in quadrant Lima Charlie Six,

76
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,916
mayday transmitted by Red Scout EB-66.

77
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,194
Look for smoke and chutes.

78
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:01,716
-Repeat, look for smoke and chutes.
-Roger.

79
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,276
02-FA C. 02, come in.

80
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:12,671
This is FAC-02. Call sign, Birddog.

81
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,638
-Identify yourself.
-Bat 21.

82
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,075
I'm the parachute above you, 1 o'clock.

83
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,999
Have you in sight.

84
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,752
Turn off your beeper, Bat 21,

85
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,479
or Charlie will get to you
before the Jolly Greens.

86
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,710
Will advise. Happy landings.

87
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,915
Roger.

88
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,514
Bat 21, get out of that paddy.

89
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,194
Hoochers to the south.
Head north to the tree line.

90
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,714
Repeat, head north to the tree line.

91
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,718
Repeat, tree line north. Roger that?

92
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:32,232
Negative. I want to wait
for the choppers. Negative.

93
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,754
Let's get the basic relationship down here.

94
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,877
I'm the lifeguard,
you're the drowning man.

95
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,235
If you relax, I can bring you to shore.

96
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,709
If you fight me,
then I'll have to slap you around.

97
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,279
Now, get your ass in gear, mister.

98
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:56,520
Bat 21, Charlie firing mortars
from the south.

99
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,114
Advise the tree line.
Repeat, advise the tree line.

100
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,597
Birddog, this is Bat 21.
I can't go any further.

101
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:59,752
-Good vantage from this position.
-Copy, Bat 21.

102
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,478
What about the others,
anybody else make it out?

103
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:06,513
None reported. We're still looking.
Just stay calm.

104
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:09,068
I'll try.

105
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,235
Don't worry, Bat 21. We'll get you out.

106
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,753
But it's not gonna happen today.

107
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,913
All choppers busy
evacing fire base at Quang Tri.

108
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,560
Company of grunts overrun by Charlie.

109
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,074
Jolly Greens will pick you up
in the morning.

110
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,351
Say again your last transmission.

111
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,830
Repeat, Jolly Greens will pick you up
in the morning.

112
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:42,037
There will be no pickup today.
Copy, Bat 21?

113
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,278
I copy, Birddog.

114
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,316
Okay, listen, Bat 21.

115
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:53,392
I'm running low on juice,
have to return to base.

116
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,715
Birddog, thanks for your help.

117
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,438
That's what I'm here for.

118
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,118
-Birddog, are you gonna be back?
-That's the plan.

119
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,829
Birddog signing off.
Keep your head down. See you later.

120
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,119
Bat 21 out.

123
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:44,917
-How was your flight, sir?
-Same old shit.

124
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,796
Bad movies and terrible food.

125
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,753
Don't you... Don't you think
you're pushing it a little, Captain?

126
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,479
You've almost doubled the base record.

127
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,835
Doubled the base record? Gee.

128
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,516
I'll pin a medal on my chest.

129
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:04,915
Could you check my right aileron?
It's sticking a bit, okay?

131
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:12,310
-Yeah, I gotta replace it, sir.
-How long will that take?

132
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:16,476
Well, I can borrow one from 453.

133
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,952
Man, that's Anderson's ship.

134
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,793
The way he flies, Captain,
he'll never miss it, sir.

135
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,836
I like your initiative, Sergeant.

136
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,469
Keep it up.

137
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:33,670
Well, we've pulled
our share of pilots out of there,

138
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,433
but never a 53-year-old
Lieutenant Colonel.

139
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:40,757
-53-year-old Lieutenant Colonel?
-That's right.

140
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:42,558
Navigator on that EB.

141
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:48,711
Well, they just gave me crew codes
and no names and ranks.

142
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:52,471
Well, I am told that Hambleton
is one of our top people.

143
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,791
He's an electronics
countermeasure expert.

144
00:14:55,880 --> 00:15:00,112
I am told that the communists
will have a dossier on him that thick.

145
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,192
So, in the morning, when we get our birds
back, we're gonna go in and get him.

146
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,750
Seventh Air Force does not want
Charlie getting their hands on him.

147
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,070
We'll get him tomorrow then, sir.

148
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,515
In the meantime,
I want you to go back out there tonight.

149
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,033
He's not going anywhere, Colonel.

150
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:16,476
I know, because I'm gonna
make damn certain he's secure.

151
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,996
Then why don't you send Anderson?
Didn't he just get his pilot's license?

152
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,354
You better watch it, Captain.

153
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,592
Look, sir, I'm tired, I'm two weeks short,
and that area's pretty hot.

154
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:32,590
And I don't want to get shot down
on some public relations mission, okay?

155
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,670
All right, then I'll make it easy
for you, Captain.

156
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:43,673
It's an order, and you damn well
will carry it out, is that clear?

157
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,674
Yes, sir.

158
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,118
Thank you for the ride, sir.

161
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:33,634
Okay, 50 piaster.

162
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,790
-Oh, come on.
-Come on, chicken shits.

163
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:37,996
-Chicken shits.
-I'm out. No way.

164
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:40,469
-Okay.
-Hey, Clarky, pull up a chair

165
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,232
before these pigeons are totally penniless.

166
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,629
Another time.
I gotta go back up again tonight.

167
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,678
Going back up again?
Damn, you're putting in the hours.

168
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,398
Yeah, tell Walker.

169
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,199
I gotta start carrying
my sleeping bag with me.

170
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,748
Okay. I got two pair.

171
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,911
-Three sixes.
-Jesus!

172
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,035
I got two pairs of sevens,

173
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,473
and your other six.

174
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,829
Damn.

175
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:05,354
I thought you newspaper boys
would be a bit sharper than that.

176
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,510
-What rag do you write for again?
-New York Times.

177
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:09,192
Oh, yeah. I picked one up once.

178
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,633
You read, Ross?

179
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,870
He probably stole it
from some derelict in the park

180
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,075
who was using it as a blanket.

181
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,071
-I gave him a nickel.
-That's true. That's true.

182
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:18,549
I couldn't find the comics, so I returned it.

183
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,834
You get your money back?

184
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,275
Yeah, I ended up finishing a pint
of radiator fluid with the guy.

185
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,715
It was about then
I figured it was time to enlist.

186
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,872
And here I am,
the best goddamn evac pilot in Nam.

187
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,552
Tell it, Ross.

188
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,790
Flying those choppers every day
scrambles up your brains.

189
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,869
You get facts confused.

190
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,837
Ross here thinks that it takes some skill

191
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,672
to keep one of those eggbeaters
up in the air.

192
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,194
Typical FAC pilot, he labors
under the misapprehension

193
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,078
that he's the most Sierra Hotel cowboy
in the Air Force.

194
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,833
Real truth is, he flies
a fucking VW Microbus with wings.

196
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,231
Well, this VW pilot
flies 10 feet off the deck,

197
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,719
draws fire from SAMS,

198
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,997
down to 8-year-olds
with slingshots with pebbles.

199
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,517
A confirmation on that.

200
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:59,512
A lot of times, I've seen
Clarky return here... You want one?

201
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:01,591
With leaves in his teeth.

202
00:21:01,680 --> 00:21:03,193
-Of course...
-Two.

203
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,350
...us black folks ain't got
no depth perception,

204
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,556
so we gotta fly what we gets.

205
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:11,357
They won't
let us fly fast airplanes.

207
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,200
You gotta be particular
in this man's Air Force.

208
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,909
Now, right here, you are looking at
a perfect flyboy profile.

209
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,636
The kind of guy you can trust
when the shit hits the fan.

210
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,709
Yeah, right.

212
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,399
He's hit the fan, man.

213
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:27,471
-He's right.
-He's got that.

214
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,639
-See you later, Clarky.
-Later, Clarky.

215
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,516
Don't wait up for me, okay?

216
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,114
Take care.

217
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:55,037
Birddog, Bat 21. Is that you?

218
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,277
Roger, Bat 21. It's me.

219
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,437
I need a visual reference
so I can stay in range.

220
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:04,108
Wait one.

221
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,399
Got you, Bat 21.

222
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,038
Positive contact.

223
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:40,438
I appreciate you dropping by, Birddog.

224
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:42,431
That's what I'm here for.

225
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,633
Charlie walked by my hole
about an hour ago.

226
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,390
-How many?
-10 or 12.

227
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,112
Seems to be quiet now.

228
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:55,839
Just stay calm.

229
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:59,194
You'll be out of there in the morning.

230
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:03,398
Birddog, could you do me
a personal favor?

231
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,674
Shoot.

232
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:09,955
Get in touch with my wife.
I was supposed to call her tonight.

233
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:11,189
She'll be scared to death.

234
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,838
Her name is Gwen.

235
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,794
I know, I pulled your personal file.

236
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,759
I got her address and number.
But I think you should let it ride for a day.

237
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:23,469
She may not be too excited about
where you decided to spend the night.

238
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,833
Yeah, we'll do it your way.

239
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,831
I'm glad somebody's thinking clearly.

240
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,835
How long you been flying Oscar Deuces?

241
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:35,909
Too long. Due to rotate soon.

242
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:40,229
You know, I'm probably the oldest captain
in the Air Force.

243
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:43,710
-How old are you?
-Would you believe 35 in June?

244
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,718
That's not very old.

245
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,117
Shit, sometimes it is.

246
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,598
Are you married, Birddog?

247
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,158
Yeah.

248
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,310
Got a wife and kid back home.

249
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,510
I've been thinking about my old lady
a lot since I've been down here.

250
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,472
Funny how that works.

251
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:21,949
She keeps bugging me that my mind
is someplace else when I'm with her.

252
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,469
Yeah, yeah, I know what you mean.

253
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,389
Any news on the other crew members?

254
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,234
No, no other chutes were spotted.
We're still searching for the wreckage.

255
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,548
The jungle is hot.

256
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:39,154
Has anyone contacted Scott's wife?

257
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,629
Yeah, that's been taken care of.

259
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,637
I feel like a real jerk.

260
00:24:50,120 --> 00:24:53,476
I'm the big expert on this deal
and I get us shot down.

261
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:57,591
Don't beat yourself up, Bat 21.
It happens.

262
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:02,311
You okay for the night, Bat 21?

263
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,995
Yeah, no problem. Thanks for checking in.

264
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,319
Then I'm RTB.

265
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,152
Tuck yourself in.

266
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:14,515
Carpool will pick you up at first light.

267
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:19,195
This is Birddog signing off, Bat 21.

269
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,352
Birddog, Birddog, this is Bat 21.

270
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,317
Are you in the vicinity?

271
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,757
Roger, Bat 21.

272
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:38,755
Just about to give you a wake-up call.

273
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,709
Birddog, take a look at the intersection
of Hollywood and Vine, rush-hour traffic.

274
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:46,360
Could be a problem for our Jolly Greens.

275
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,476
Roger, Bat 21. Stand by.

276
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:53,634
Let's put some hits on these
guys. I got a good visual. I'll call them.

277
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,315
You sure? You're pretty close
to the action. You might get nicked.

278
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:58,992
I can see the crossroads from here.

279
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,595
About half a klick south of the rice paddy.
Mark it.

280
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,352
You pulling rank on me, Bat 21?

281
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:09,318
-I'll take my chances.
-You got it.

282
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,470
Here you go. Enjoy the show.

285
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,514
Birddog to Crabtree, I marked my targets,
what are you hauling?

286
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:35,751
Roger, Birddog, this is Crabtree,
coming in from the south

287
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,274
with a full load of snake and nape.

288
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,113
Roger, Crabtree. You see my smoke?

289
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,111
Affirmative, Birddog.

290
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,758
Waste the area.

291
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,035
But, remember, we have a friendly
in the vicinity.

292
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:50,112
Try not to ruin his day with a stray frag.

293
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,113
Don't worry, Birddog,
we can thread a needle if we have to.

294
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,316
Thread a needle, my ass. Shit.

297
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:50,317
Birddog, on your next pass,
move just east of the intersection.

298
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,516
You've got camouflaged tanks.

299
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,953
Roger, Bat 21.

300
00:29:57,040 --> 00:30:01,670
Crabtree, tanks just east of intersection.
Missed on first pass.

301
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,357
That's a roger, Birddog.

302
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,232
We're Winchester, Birddog,
please assess damage.

303
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,749
Additional targets still appear active.

304
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:42,638
Copy, Crabtree.
Return to base, will advise.

307
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,236
Bat 21, from Birddog.

308
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,515
Bat 21.

309
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,196
Bat 21, from Birddog.

310
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:28,070
Do you copy, Bat 21?

311
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,428
-Go, Birddog.
-You intact?

312
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,919
Affirmative.

313
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,479
Nice quarterbacking.

314
00:31:38,560 --> 00:31:40,994
Maybe we ought to leave you in
for the second half.

315
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,638
Negative. I've seen enough.

316
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,348
I guess it's different on the ground.

317
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,555
It's too damn close.

318
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:56,031
Bat 21, your pickup may be delayed.
The area is still too hot.

319
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,919
Negative, negative.
It's gotta be today, God damn it!

320
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,911
I repeat, area is still too hot.

321
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,034
It's a war zone, God damn it.
What do you expect?

322
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,394
Relax, Bat 21.

323
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:10,631
-We'll get you out at first light.
-Jesus Christ!

324
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,951
Just stay calm. Birddog will deliver.

325
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,273
Negative, Birddog.

326
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:19,318
Bat 21 has a plan.
I worked it out last night.

327
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:23,279
Birddog would like to RTB, refuel,
and confer before you move.

328
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,430
Negative, Birddog. Not enough time.

329
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,593
Bat 21. Bat 21.

330
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,194
Birddog would like to confer
before you move.

331
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,275
Negative, Bat's on the move.

332
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,749
-Heading for the Swanee.
-Swanee?

333
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,672
Repeat, heading for the Swanee,
like in the song.

334
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,115
"Swanee, Swanee.
How I love you. How I love you."

335
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,758
Yeah, yeah, I know the song.

336
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:56,796
"Swanee, how I love you."

337
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,309
Uh-huh.

338
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,870
I think I broke the code, Bat 21.

339
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,109
I still do not advise.

340
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,350
Route takes you through
too many unfriendlies.

341
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,237
Birddog has no way to track you.

342
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:11,437
I worked out a front nine
to avoid the hazards.

343
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:14,239
Copy this, add zero to yardage.

344
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:17,359
Holes three, six, and eight at Shaw.

345
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:21,676
South 1 and 17 at MacDill.

346
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:26,029
Coming in on 2, 12, 14, and 18 at Hickam.

347
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,473
How do you copy?

348
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,028
Copy, but I still don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

349
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:37,195
Contact Colonel Douglass
at Korat Air Base for instructions.

350
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,673
I'm not sure this is a good idea, Bat 21.

351
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,275
Bat 21 is teeing off
from the blue markers now, out.

352
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,834
Bat 21, from Birddog.

353
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,431
Bat 21. Bat 21, from Birddog.

354
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,512
Bat... Oh, shit!

357
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:19,434
You wanna tell me about it?

358
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,192
Amateur's moving on me.

359
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,589
-Where's he going?
-I don't know.

360
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,117
He gave me some kind of goddamn code

361
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,031
after I decided it was too hot
to pick him up.

362
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:30,475
Yeah, I heard you brought in the flyboys.

363
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,314
Mmm-mmm.

364
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,749
That was his idea.

365
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:37,877
That's some kind of tough bastard. Shit.

366
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:41,032
I mean, he must realize
they aren't always that accurate.

367
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:44,635
No shit. I've seen frags drop 30 feet
in front of my windscreen.

369
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,635
Wait, wait, wait. Where you going?

370
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,995
Sit down and finish your beer. Sit down.

371
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,594
Man, I gotta go up again. I gotta find him.

372
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:56,877
Geez, you're spending more time
in the air than on mother earth.

373
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,313
You look like hell.

374
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,838
Well, I need the overtime.

375
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:06,753
Jesus, you are going for a DFFC,
aren't you?

376
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,991
A Distinguished Fucking Flying Cross.

377
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:12,674
Man, I must have
vapor-locked or something.

378
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:14,876
"FAC pilot saves Colonel."

379
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,757
You're gearing up for the ceremony.

380
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:19,912
A full dress parade, a nice shiny medal
to show the folks back home,

381
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:23,037
and a newfound respect
in the military community. Shit.

382
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:25,755
Clarky, stick around. Come on.

383
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:27,478
We'll take a chopper up,
we'll shoot a few cows,

384
00:35:27,560 --> 00:35:28,959
we'll have a barbeque. What do you say?

385
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:31,996
No, sir. Not tonight, yeah?

386
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,196
Don't you think you've got
a little obsessive behavior going here?

387
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:40,511
Obsessive behavior?
I mean, me, obsessive behavior?

388
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,229
Man, I recall some of the crazy lunatic shit
that you've done in your machine.

389
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,880
Yeah, well, maybe I like hauling
those sorry dudes out of the bush.

390
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:50,157
Maybe I like to see their big sloppy smiles
when I drag them into the chopper.

391
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,912
Because you just know
they thought they were going to spend

392
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:54,878
the rest of the war dodging Punji sticks,
snakes, and gooks,

393
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,269
and I hand them a Camel and a candy bar,

394
00:35:57,360 --> 00:36:00,158
and they smile like
when they got laid for the first time.

395
00:36:00,240 --> 00:36:03,038
You know, I'm not into
this death and destruction bullshit, either,

396
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,872
or flying fucking medals.

397
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:08,589
You know, all I want to do
is bring the old man back.

398
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:14,670
Okay. Go on, get him through the night.

399
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:18,948
I'll haul his ass out in the morning.
Okay, Birddog?

404
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:41,160
No, no, no. Look. Friend.

406
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,871
Friend. Friend.

411
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:49,555
Pa.

412
00:39:53,720 --> 00:39:54,994
I'm sorry.

417
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,515
No, no, no. Number 14 at Hickam.

418
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:06,193
Right, Hickam.

419
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,196
Yeah, the par four across the water.

420
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,593
That's the one.
Hold the phone a minute. Captain.

421
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,313
Number 14 at Hickam, 390 yards.
Draw it in.

422
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,915
Don't forget to add the zero.
Come in, Clark.

423
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:25,232
Colonel, that puts our puzzle together.
Now, let's hope the damn thing works.

424
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:29,954
Right. Yeah,
I will keep you abreast of everything.

425
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:33,358
Right, I will, and thank you.

426
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,033
What have we got, sir?

427
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:41,554
Well, I got a lot to tell you about your boy.

428
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,193
It seems like Hambleton was flying
a Pave Penny mission

429
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:47,350
for a major bombing strike, Captain.

430
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,911
Came up with the idea himself,
and then he volunteers to go.

431
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:53,879
Right man for the job and all that.

432
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:56,428
Sounds likely to me
he must have written the damn manuals.

433
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:58,238
And Charlie would like to
get their hands on him.

434
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,038
Open him up and shit.

435
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:03,149
It doesn't get any better.

436
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,959
The strike was scheduled
for 0700 hours tomorrow.

437
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:09,919
Their objective, to carpet-bomb
this crossroad where Hambleton is

438
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,389
and everything around it
for eight kilometers.

439
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:19,835
That's what he was talking about.

440
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:21,035
Exactly.

441
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:29,629
He won't make it. They're gonna blast
the whole goddamn area.

442
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:32,711
I'm fucking blowing my brains out

443
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:35,234
trying to get this motherfucker home and
they're talking about carpet-bombing.

444
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,355
God damn it, Captain.

445
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:37,839
No, no, wait a minute.
Now, I'm not gonna...

446
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,399
Shut up, God damn it!

447
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,073
I bought us 24 hours.

448
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,478
That's the best I could do.

449
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,269
I had to put my ass on the line to get that.

450
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,315
I told Seventh Air
we'd get him out of there.

451
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,030
That's exactly what we're gonna do.

452
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:04,997
Nice work, Colonel.

453
00:44:05,080 --> 00:44:06,513
Well, let's don't start
jumping up and down,

454
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:09,160
throwing babies in the air yet, Captain.

455
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,074
Better wait and see
if Hambleton's code works.

456
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:15,393
You got any ideas?

457
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:19,753
Douglass knew what Hambleton
was talking about right away.

458
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:22,957
I mean, they're both golf fanatics.
They play three times a week.

459
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:24,553
Hambleton's got a four handicap.

460
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:27,552
Now, with all that in mind,
come here, I wanna show you something.

461
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,959
Thank you, Howard.

462
00:44:31,280 --> 00:44:33,840
Now, stay with me, Captain.

463
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,831
This gets pretty wild.

464
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,957
Hambleton wants to get here to the river,
to the Swanee, right?

465
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:41,156
Well, how's he gonna do that?

466
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,596
I mean, he's not about to just tear ass out
through there and lose contact with you.

467
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,193
Hell, he's dead meat.

468
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,748
On the other hand, he can't get on
the radio and tell you where he's going,

469
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:49,955
Charlie's got VHF, too.

470
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:52,679
So he gives you
an imaginary nine holes of golf.

471
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,638
When you lay those nine holes
over our map, Captain,

472
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,878
that's what they look like.

473
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:03,034
Now we can track him.
Now we know where he is.

474
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:04,917
We know exactly
where he comes out at the end

475
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,992
because he didn't pick those holes
at random.

476
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,390
They come off three Air Force golf courses
he's played 100 times.

477
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,550
Knows them like the back of his hand.

478
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:14,675
Now, let's take these three,

479
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,877
they come off Shaw Air Force Base.
First hole,

480
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,793
410-yard, par four dogleg.

481
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:22,711
We add that zero
Hambleton's talking about,

482
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:24,119
it reads 4,100 yards,

483
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,795
and the first green puts him right there.
Next green, here and here.

484
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:30,952
These two holes come off the front
and back of MacDill.

485
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,838
These four finishing holes here,
according to Douglass,

486
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:36,639
are the holes Hambleton birdied
the last time he played Hickam

487
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,395
to shoot a one-under-par 71.
Pretty good score, huh?

489
00:45:41,600 --> 00:45:43,875
Clever son of a bitch.

490
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:46,679
-You play golf, Captain?
-No, sir.

491
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,591
Golf wasn't big in my neighborhood.

492
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:51,148
All right. Well,
all these holes are on these cards,

493
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,312
and this is a glossary of golf terminology.

494
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,312
Now, you're gonna communicate
with Hambleton using these terms,

495
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,789
because Charlie won't know
what in the hell you're talking about

496
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:02,438
until it's too late anyway.

497
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:04,431
So get busy. Learn this.

498
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:07,430
It's the key to Hambleton's code.

499
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:14,353
"Doglegs. Doglegs..."

501
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,718
Does Anderson know
you borrowed his prop?

502
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,518
No, sir.

503
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:29,670
I'd love to be there
when he tries to take off.

504
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,478
He's gonna need
a hell of a long runway, Captain.

505
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:33,073
Yeah.

506
00:47:33,160 --> 00:47:38,154
Look, at the risk of being out of line, sir,
I think you look a bit overextended.

507
00:47:38,240 --> 00:47:40,356
Now, in the best interests of the mission
and your personal safety,

508
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,032
I've put together this tape.

509
00:47:42,120 --> 00:47:45,874
Some serious sounds, Captain.
They're guaranteed to keep you alert.

510
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:48,432
Quite a man, Rumbaugh.

511
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:52,999
You just have a good flight, all right, sir?

512
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,354
All right.

514
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,635
Fuck!

515
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:16,312
Son of a bitch!

516
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:18,995
God! Wake up, wake up, wake up.

517
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,515
Fuck!

518
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:27,794
God...

520
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,796
Yes, thank you, Rumbaugh. Shit.

521
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:59,393
Bat 21, this is Birddog. Come in, come in.
Where the hell are you?

522
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:05,512
Birddog, this is Bat 21.
I read you loud and clear.

523
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,318
Copy, Bat 21.

524
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:09,516
It's good to hear from you.
I thought I lost you.

525
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,519
It's good to hear your voice, Birddog.

526
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,229
I'm at the third fairway.
I'm trying to get a fix on your position.

527
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:19,435
You broke the code?

528
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:22,671
I'm working on it.
This is not an easy game to play.

529
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:24,193
What is your

530
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:28,435
lie?

531
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:33,075
Birddog, I'm 150 yards northwest
of the third green.

532
00:50:34,160 --> 00:50:36,196
I'll give you a signal. Wait one.

533
00:50:45,400 --> 00:50:46,833
Got you marked.

534
00:50:53,200 --> 00:50:54,633
Any problems?

535
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:59,359
I ran into an unfriendly a while back.
I had to do some backtracking.

536
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:00,953
You all right?

537
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:04,953
The landing gear is a little damaged,
but it's still serviceable.

538
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:07,953
Sorry to hear about that.

539
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:13,799
Listen, Birddog.

540
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:17,513
-You gotta get me out of here.
-Affirmative.

541
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:22,114
I'm here to tell you the good news.
We bought 24 hours, copy that?

542
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:25,558
You bet I copy.

543
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:28,950
You must have friends in high places
who want to see your face again.

544
00:51:29,720 --> 00:51:31,438
That's nice to know.

545
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:34,352
Bat 21,

546
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:38,035
stay put and don't transmit.
I have business to take care of.

547
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:45,676
This is Birddog. This is Birddog.

548
00:51:45,760 --> 00:51:47,796
Anyone on station at Pleiku?

549
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,119
Copy, Cupcake.

550
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,078
If it's not too much trouble,
I'd enjoy your company at coordinates

551
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:02,835
Zulu Zulu Five Lima Hotel Seven.

552
00:52:02,920 --> 00:52:05,718
-Cupcake on the way.
-Copy, Cupcake.

553
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,714
Back to you, Bat 21. This is Birddog.

554
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:13,154
Birddog,

555
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,192
I killed a man today.

556
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,039
Roger that.

557
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:27,278
He wasn't even a soldier.

558
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,638
He just kept coming.

559
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,998
I couldn't stop him.

560
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:38,434
I understand.

561
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,472
I didn't want to do it.

562
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:46,558
I never had to do anything like that
before in my life.

563
00:52:49,240 --> 00:52:51,276
I've been sitting in an airplane
at 30,000 feet

564
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:53,191
with a cup of coffee in front of me.

565
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,358
Look here, Bat 21. I've never met you,
but you don't sound like a killer.

566
00:53:00,440 --> 00:53:02,476
I'm sure you couldn't stop it
from happening.

567
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,279
Now, the important thing is to
put it behind you.

569
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,830
What the hell's going on, Birddog?

570
00:53:13,920 --> 00:53:16,593
There's too many unfriendly foursomes
in your vicinity.

Fireworks, courtesy of WolfPack.

573
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,396
Jesus Christ. Does it ever stop?

574
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,550
Are you with me, Bat 21?

575
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,918
Yeah, Birddog, I'm here.

576
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:37,157
All right. I want you to listen real hard.

577
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,548
I know you're hurting, but we have to deal
with getting you back to the clubhouse.

578
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:43,915
We're gonna pick you up at first light.

579
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,593
Damn, I'm ready.

580
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:50,513
I want you to play the fourth hole tonight.

581
00:53:50,600 --> 00:53:52,511
The green will be our LZ.

582
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,237
It's a long goddamn hole.

583
00:53:58,200 --> 00:54:00,919
Yeah, it's a few hazards,
but the green is safe.

585
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:06,350
Think you can make it, Bat 21?

586
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:10,315
Yeah, I should be able to play through.

587
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:13,352
Looking forward to buying you a drink.

588
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,798
I'll start the tab.

589
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,033
Roger that.

590
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,157
Birddog signing off.
I'll see you in the morning.

591
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:19,919
Bat 21, this is Birddog. Come in.

592
00:56:24,360 --> 00:56:26,351
Birddog, Bat 21, go ahead.

593
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:28,832
Are you still on course?

594
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:35,029
Birddog, yeah, I'm on an easy chip shot
from the green.

595
00:56:35,120 --> 00:56:38,112
Except that there's a village right here
in front of me.

596
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:42,869
Reconed yesterday. Area's safe.
We'll take another look.

597
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,033
Okay, Birddog.

598
00:56:57,560 --> 00:57:00,313
Shine up your medal, Clarky.
I'm bringing back your boy.

599
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:03,790
I'll personally alert Bat 21.

600
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:08,273
Bat 21, this is Birddog again. Come in.

601
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:11,598
Yeah, Birddog. I'm still here.

602
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:14,035
Not for long. I'm sending in my best man.

603
00:57:14,120 --> 00:57:15,633
Get your flares ready
and don't pop the smoke

604
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,188
until you hear from
Jolly Greens, understand?

605
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,913
Roger, Birddog.

606
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,716
Bat 21, this is Cobra Leader, do you copy?

607
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:38,628
Go ahead.

608
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:41,154
We'll come over your position
from the north.

609
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,231
Be ready to pop those flares.

610
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,877
I've been ready for two days.

611
00:58:05,480 --> 00:58:07,550
Well, what you got, Big Sky?

612
00:58:07,640 --> 00:58:10,029
Going to send Birddog in to take a look.

613
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:11,995
Roger.

614
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:28,470
Talk to me, Birddog.

615
00:58:28,560 --> 00:58:29,959
Looks quiet.

616
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:32,597
I'm going in
for a closer look.

617
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,038
Here we go. Be right back.

618
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:59,077
It don't look like anybody's home.

619
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:17,350
All right, Big Sky. Go get him.
I'll cover your tail.

620
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:32,915
Jolly Green from Birddog.
You're looking good, looking good.

621
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,558
Coming in on your LZ.

623
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:54,198
Shit, we're taking hits!

625
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:58,671
The village is hot! The village is hot!

626
00:59:58,760 --> 01:00:02,639
Birddog, there's at least
two machine guns in the village.

627
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:05,680
I thought you said
the goddamn LZ was secured!

628
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:08,354
Get back in the trees, Bat 21.
Back in the trees!

629
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,716
Stevie, open up!

633
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,955
Get those mines ready. We're gonna
drop them right here in this paddy.

634
01:00:43,040 --> 01:00:44,792
Keep away from Bat 21.

635
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:02,194
Drop those mines.

636
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:13,554
Son of a bitch!

637
01:01:18,440 --> 01:01:20,431
Big Sky, get the hell out of there.

638
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,034
I'm coming back. Open up, Steven.

639
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:27,795
Get on those guns and give them hell.

641
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:40,752
Son of a bitch! He's hit!

642
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,959
Take care of him.
Hendricks, get on the gun!

643
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,196
Big Sky, abort mission.

644
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,748
Repeat, abort! Abort!

645
01:01:53,040 --> 01:01:55,508
Boys, they're not gonna
stick a fork in me till I'm done.

646
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,874
We're gonna get that boy.

647
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,633
Abort mission, Big Sky.
Get the hell out of there, Ross.

648
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:02,075
Sorry, transmission is breaking up.

649
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,957
Repeat, abort!

650
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:06,474
Sorry, transmission is breaking up.

651
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:10,439
That's bullshit! You heard me.
I said, abort!

653
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:20,351
Fuck it. Let's go in.

654
01:02:25,560 --> 01:02:27,152
Come on, you...

655
01:02:35,320 --> 01:02:36,878
Ross, get out of there!

656
01:02:41,880 --> 01:02:43,359
Son of a bitch!

657
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,154
He's hit!

658
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,314
Birddog, he's hit!

659
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:49,149
Shit!

660
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:53,712
Shit, I'm losing it.

661
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:08,599
Big Sky, Big Ross, pull out!

662
01:03:08,680 --> 01:03:10,671
Shit, we're going down.

663
01:03:10,760 --> 01:03:12,910
We're going down. Mayday! Mayday!

664
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,992
I can't see a goddamn thing, God damn it!

665
01:03:23,080 --> 01:03:24,752
We're going down. Mayday!

667
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:53,594
Start, motherfucker!

668
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:56,433
-Open up, for Christ's sake!
-For God's sake!

669
01:03:56,520 --> 01:03:57,794
Let's get out of here, Ross.

670
01:03:57,880 --> 01:03:59,677
Fuck, they're coming for us!

671
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,591
Fuck, the gun's jammed!

672
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:03,671
Let's go, Ross! Come on!

673
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:06,593
God damn it all! Those fucking gooks!

674
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:07,715
Start!

675
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:10,715
Shit! Start!

676
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:13,597
-Come on! Let's go, Ross!
-Shit!

677
01:04:13,680 --> 01:04:16,148
Come on, seriously,
we gotta get out of here.

678
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:18,356
Come on, Ross, get this thing going!

679
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:21,830
Come on, we gotta get out of here,
God damn it! Come on!

681
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,156
Take it up, man, we gotta go!

682
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:31,839
Ross, come on!

683
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,549
-Damn it, he's down.
-Come on!

684
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,756
Ridley, God damn it, give me the gun!

686
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:42,039
Shit! Give me the gun, Ridley.

687
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:44,873
Give me the goddamn...
Steven, God damn it!

688
01:04:45,240 --> 01:04:46,673
Jesus Christ!

689
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:47,989
Don't shoot!

691
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:50,838
Don't shoot!

692
01:04:50,920 --> 01:04:52,319
Don't shoot!

693
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:53,879
Holy shit!

694
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:56,433
I'm fucking hit, man.

695
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:57,999
Jesus Christ!

696
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,790
Steve, stay alive. Someone will be back.

697
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,677
Don't fucking leave us, Ross.

698
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:09,877
Steve, stay alive, God damn it!

700
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:21,231
-Don't leave us, Ross.
-Don't worry, I'll be back.

701
01:05:22,200 --> 01:05:23,519
All right.

702
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:31,151
Ross, don't leave us!

703
01:05:31,240 --> 01:05:32,434
Ross!

705
01:05:34,040 --> 01:05:35,951
Goddamn motherfuckers!

707
01:06:26,200 --> 01:06:28,634
Birddog, they've got two of our men.

708
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,676
I think the rest of the crew is dead.

709
01:06:31,320 --> 01:06:33,595
Copy, Bat 21. Stand by.

710
01:06:33,680 --> 01:06:36,240
Cobra Leader,
Charlie has two of my airmen.

711
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:37,719
Can you identify?

712
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,438
Negative, Birddog.

713
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:41,238
Can't make out from here.

714
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:43,151
We're holding our fire.

715
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,075
They shot my damn hydraulics out!

716
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:49,513
I'm not gonna be able
to put this thing down here.

717
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:51,594
I'm going down for a closer look.

718
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:52,908
Not advisable, Birddog.

719
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:54,353
It will be a quick pass.

721
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:08,790
Confirm, two airmen. One is the pilot.

723
01:07:24,680 --> 01:07:26,671
You know what, Charlie,
I don't follow your fucking drift.

724
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:27,829
I took Spanish in school.

727
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,516
Get your fucking slimy fucking hands
off me!

728
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,118
I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about!

729
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:44,480
I don't understand, Charlie.
I don't understand.

730
01:07:45,120 --> 01:07:47,759
Birddog, they're trying to get him
to tell where I am.

731
01:07:48,640 --> 01:07:50,710
Copy, Bat 21. Just stay low.

733
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:06,311
Bastard! Motherfucker!

735
01:08:20,680 --> 01:08:22,557
They just killed one of our men.

736
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:24,471
Was it the pilot, Bat 21?

737
01:08:25,600 --> 01:08:26,874
I don't think so.

738
01:08:27,480 --> 01:08:29,914
It's me they want.
I'm gonna give myself up.

739
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,833
Keep your ass down, Bat 21.
Charlie doesn't bargain.

740
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:33,989
There's nothing you can do about it.

741
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:36,992
Now, retreat, double-time.
Back into the trees.

743
01:09:00,960 --> 01:09:02,439
Come on, fellow, don't bullshit.

744
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,909
Come on, come on, you motherfucker.
Come on.

747
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:12,669
Come on.

748
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:15,909
They're walking him out
into the mine field.

749
01:09:16,240 --> 01:09:17,389
Oh, Jesus.

750
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,108
Come on.

751
01:09:21,840 --> 01:09:23,193
Come on!

753
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,631
Hey, come on.

755
01:10:14,160 --> 01:10:15,673
God damn it!

759
01:10:41,120 --> 01:10:43,031
Motherfucker!

760
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:47,479
You lowlife...

763
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,112
I've got enough
dead heroes for one day, Clark.

764
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,517
Get your ass out of there!

765
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:11,953
Oh, fuck!

768
01:11:18,560 --> 01:11:21,074
You get Bat 21 back on the course!

769
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:25,393
Then rendezvous with me
at Helo One Eight Five!

770
01:11:25,480 --> 01:11:28,074
I'm gonna waste
this whole goddamned area.

772
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:42,915
Foursquare leader,
hustle your ass over here.

773
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:47,391
One klick north of Helo One Niner Six.

774
01:11:47,480 --> 01:11:49,675
Gun emplacement in village.

775
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:52,638
Jolly Green down. Crew is dead.

776
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,833
Look for the smoke.

777
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:04,670
People still in the village.
Charlie's using them for cover.

778
01:12:04,760 --> 01:12:06,830
Stay off frequency, Bat 21.

779
01:12:06,920 --> 01:12:08,831
Wait instructions from Birddog.

780
01:12:16,280 --> 01:12:19,477
Birddog, Birddog, people are in the village.

781
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,151
Repeat, civilians,
women and children in the village.

782
01:12:23,240 --> 01:12:25,435
That's a confirmation. Will advise.

783
01:12:28,240 --> 01:12:30,515
Cobra Leader, this is Birddog.

784
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:34,149
Village is still not clear.
Civilians still in the area.

785
01:12:34,240 --> 01:12:36,037
Stay off frequency.

786
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,793
Delay the strike. Repeat, delay strike.

787
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:43,034
Bat 21, get back on course.
We'll connect with you at Swanee.

788
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:45,880
Fuck the goddamn Swanee!
Delay the strike!

789
01:12:45,960 --> 01:12:49,157
That was my friend laying in the mud
with his fucking head blown off!

790
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:52,869
Now, get back on course!
Now, do as I say! Back on course!

791
01:13:54,040 --> 01:13:56,235
People keep dying all around me.

792
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:03,471
I'm through killing.

793
01:14:05,320 --> 01:14:07,276
I'm through God damn...

794
01:14:58,080 --> 01:14:59,672
You called for me, sir?

796
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,030
We lost six people today, Clark.

797
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:09,795
Kids, all of them. Just kids.

798
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,993
I couldn't guarantee
we'd get him out of there

799
01:15:14,080 --> 01:15:16,469
if we had another week, damn it.
It's too hot.

800
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,352
So, the strike is a go.

801
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:25,717
0700 hours tomorrow.

802
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,551
They're gonna level the whole area.

803
01:15:29,600 --> 01:15:32,831
All we can do is hope and pray to God
Hambleton makes it to the river.

804
01:15:34,600 --> 01:15:37,637
I... I called the Navy,

805
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:42,513
and they're gonna send a patrol boat
up there.

806
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:47,112
Where are you headed?

807
01:15:48,240 --> 01:15:50,356
I'm gonna help him make it
to the river, sir.

808
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,277
Planes are grounded, Clark.

809
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:58,558
We are not to go back in there
until the strike is over.

810
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,319
Our hands are tied.

811
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,154
Yes, sir.

812
01:17:03,800 --> 01:17:05,358
Birddog, Bat 21. Over.

813
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:11,035
Birddog, Bat 21. How do you read? Over.

814
01:17:12,640 --> 01:17:14,710
Birddog, this is Bat 21. Come in.

815
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,708
I'm on the sixth hole, Birddog.
Do you copy?

816
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:20,318
Birddog, this is Bat 21.

817
01:17:21,840 --> 01:17:23,193
Come in, Birddog.

818
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,195
Thank you.

819
01:18:44,120 --> 01:18:45,394
For me?

822
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,275
Definitely not a good idea, sir.
It's a bad idea.

823
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:09,396
I trained in one of these things
15 years ago,

824
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:11,869
so just refresh my memory.
You got three minutes.

825
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:18,072
Let's go, Rumbaugh.

826
01:21:19,040 --> 01:21:20,678
-All right.
-Okay.

827
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:23,228
This is your rotor speed.
Keep it in the green.

828
01:21:23,320 --> 01:21:25,311
This is your engine speed.
Keep it also in the green.

829
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:27,038
Red line, and you crash and burn.

830
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:28,314
All right, pedals.

831
01:21:28,400 --> 01:21:32,313
Pedals work the same as your ship.
The stick does not. It's cyclic.

832
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,516
Controls the angle of your blades,
all right?

833
01:21:34,600 --> 01:21:36,318
I can't believe
you're taking the old man's ship.

834
01:21:36,400 --> 01:21:37,469
All right, power.

835
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,118
Power is controlled by your collective.

836
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:42,112
One thing you may have forgotten
is when you increase power,

837
01:21:42,200 --> 01:21:46,352
you increase left pedal
to compensate for increased torque.

838
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,716
-Got it?
-Yeah.

839
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:52,679
It's coming back to me.
What about auto rotation?

840
01:21:52,760 --> 01:21:54,671
Why, you planning
on not coming back, sir?

841
01:21:54,760 --> 01:21:56,193
Tell me anyway.

842
01:21:58,120 --> 01:21:59,394
All right.

843
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:02,429
Your engine quits,
you're falling out of the sky,

844
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:06,991
now all you've got left
is the energy stored in your blades, okay?

845
01:22:07,080 --> 01:22:09,150
Push the left... No, push the right,

846
01:22:09,240 --> 01:22:12,516
the right pedal to the floor,
collective down.

847
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:16,556
Keep you rotor speed in the green.
Keep it at about 80 knots

848
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:19,837
and about 100 feet off the deck.
You begin to flare,

849
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:22,115
and then push it on down
with the collective.

850
01:22:22,200 --> 01:22:26,034
Now, you may start to spin,
but that's cool, don't panic.

851
01:22:26,120 --> 01:22:28,554
Key point being, he who hesitates...

852
01:22:28,640 --> 01:22:31,029
-You don't want to hesitate, all right?
-All right.

853
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:34,715
Here's your checklist,
your maps, all your golf shit.

854
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:36,709
All right.

855
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:38,597
Now, you got everything, right?
You understand all this?

856
01:22:38,680 --> 01:22:40,716
-Yeah.
-All right.

857
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,438
Thanks for the lesson.

858
01:22:42,520 --> 01:22:44,397
-Just come back, all right?
-Yeah.

859
01:23:00,040 --> 01:23:01,758
Pedals! Pedals!

860
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:07,357
Collective! Shit!

861
01:23:08,440 --> 01:23:10,670
Up! Up! Up!

862
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,309
Okay, all right.

863
01:23:15,400 --> 01:23:17,038
Torque, torque, torque.

864
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:20,714
Get it up!

865
01:23:21,440 --> 01:23:23,829
You got it! You got it! Up!

867
01:23:36,800 --> 01:23:39,792
Who's that crazy son of a bitch?
Is that Clark?

868
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:41,518
I believe it is, sir.

869
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:45,158
All right, Captain,

870
01:23:45,240 --> 01:23:47,834
we're looking at a court-martial now.

871
01:23:47,920 --> 01:23:49,399
Rotor speed up.

872
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:51,959
Proper friction.

874
01:23:57,600 --> 01:24:01,798
When he gets back here, Sergeant,
I'm throwing his ass in the stockade.

875
01:24:01,880 --> 01:24:04,678
-We don't have a stockade, sir.
-I'll build one!

876
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,553
Son of a bitch!

877
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,275
Well...

878
01:24:16,720 --> 01:24:17,869
Good luck, Captain.

879
01:24:32,280 --> 01:24:35,397
All right, all right, all right. Here I come.

880
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:17,989
Chopper Pilot, this is Bat 21.

881
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:21,789
This is Chopper Pilot,
above your signal on the ninth hole.

882
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:24,440
-Is that you, Birddog?
-Yeah, it's me.

883
01:25:24,520 --> 01:25:26,192
Now, let's get you out of here.

884
01:25:26,280 --> 01:25:28,748
Fifty meters east to you
there's a small field.

885
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:31,400
If I can get into it, I can make it happen.

886
01:25:31,480 --> 01:25:33,550
Copy that, Bat 21?

887
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:35,471
I'm on my way, Birddog.

889
01:26:53,240 --> 01:26:54,958
Down!

891
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:13,113
-Let's go!
-Okay.

894
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:26,551
-Hey!
-Hang on!

896
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:41,115
I'm in.

897
01:27:49,240 --> 01:27:50,309
All right.

898
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:57,872
I'm glad to see you, Birddog.

899
01:28:01,600 --> 01:28:03,033
Have a seat, Bat 21.

900
01:28:10,200 --> 01:28:14,239
You'd better check the charts.
I had a hell of a time navigating here.

902
01:28:19,640 --> 01:28:20,868
Jesus!

903
01:28:25,440 --> 01:28:26,509
Shit!

904
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,756
You're losing oil pressure.

905
01:28:33,840 --> 01:28:35,114
Jesus.

906
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:44,070
There's the river!
We gotta make it from here.

907
01:28:44,160 --> 01:28:46,720
I'm gonna have to
put this baby down, okay?

908
01:28:49,720 --> 01:28:51,790
There's a clearing at 9 o'clock.

909
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,358
Charlie's in the woods.

910
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,868
Let's go!

911
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:02,716
It's the air strike.

912
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:04,950
It's right on time.

913
01:30:05,040 --> 01:30:06,473
Jesus. Come on!

915
01:30:16,640 --> 01:30:18,073
Go! Let's move!

918
01:31:28,160 --> 01:31:29,752
Oh, shit, Captain!

921
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:43,195
Shit.

922
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,835
You know, I've been in the service

923
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,157
most of my adult life.

924
01:34:22,120 --> 01:34:24,714
It's the first time I ever saw any war.

925
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:29,675
I guess I was a little closer to the action.

926
01:34:31,760 --> 01:34:34,433
I wanted to be a fighter pilot
since I was a kid,

927
01:34:36,400 --> 01:34:38,709
but they wouldn't let me out of the O-2.

928
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:42,238
That's lucky for me.

929
01:34:48,200 --> 01:34:49,918
You could've quit anytime.

930
01:34:52,000 --> 01:34:53,399
Why did you keep coming back?

931
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:57,830
Guess it's the stubborn side of me.

932
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,912
I started out just doing my job,
no different from you.

933
01:35:04,640 --> 01:35:07,029
I hate being told I can't do something.

934
01:35:08,000 --> 01:35:10,468
I guess that's why I'm still a captain.

935
01:35:13,520 --> 01:35:15,317
Besides,

936
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:18,073
I started feeling
what you were going through.

937
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:21,231
Heard it in your voice.

938
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,837
We home free, Colonel?

939
01:35:48,600 --> 01:35:50,716
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

940
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:56,277
Cut the "colonel" crap, okay, Birddog?

941
01:35:56,360 --> 01:35:58,157
It's Iceal Hambleton.

942
01:35:59,280 --> 01:36:00,474
"Iceal"?

943
01:36:03,680 --> 01:36:04,908
It's Ham.

944
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:09,031
Clark, Bartholomew.

945
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:11,312
"Bartholomew"?

946
01:36:11,400 --> 01:36:12,753
-Clark.
-Okay.

947
01:36:31,200 --> 01:36:33,077
This is U.S. Navy Niner-Six.

948
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,958
We have your boys aboard.
Injuries have been treated.

949
01:36:36,040 --> 01:36:38,634
We'll rendezvous with you
at base Victor 4.

950
01:36:38,720 --> 01:36:40,551
This is Niner-Six, out.

951
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:43,117
Welcome home, Bat 21.

952
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:45,948
Why don't you and the Captain
meet me at the 19th hole?

953
01:36:46,040 --> 01:36:47,758
The drinks are on me.

954
01:36:47,840 --> 01:36:49,831
Cobra Leader, over and out.
