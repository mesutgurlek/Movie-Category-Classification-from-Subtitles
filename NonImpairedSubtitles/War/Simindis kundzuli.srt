1
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,700
Are they Georgians?
(Abkhazian language)

2
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,800
Grandpa, does this land
belong to Georgians?

3
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,050
There, that land belongs to them.

4
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:31,050
Then, to whom this land belongs?

5
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:36,850
This land belongs to its creator.

6
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:14,500
Hey, sweety, what's your name?

7
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:21,450
Let's go... motherfucker...

8
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:56,100
Are you finished with your school?

9
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,850
And the diploma?

10
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,550
It'll be ready next year.

11
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:13,430
Your parents couldn't
see you graduating.

12
00:56:15,200 --> 00:56:21,850
May the god allow me
to live up to that day.

13
01:02:22,350 --> 01:02:24,250
Good day, grandpa!

14
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:29,050
You chose a quite dangerous place
to dwell on.

15
01:02:32,750 --> 01:02:35,096
Haven't you seen anyone
around this place?

16
01:02:39,100 --> 01:02:41,250
Are you sure?

17
01:02:48,050 --> 01:02:50,650
If you spot someone, tell me!

18
01:12:24,150 --> 01:12:27,350
Rest a little bit,
aren't you tired?

19
01:12:31,515 --> 01:12:33,800
You feel hot, don't you?

20
01:12:36,150 --> 01:12:38,700
But I don't understand
your Abkhazian...

21
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:47,000
Get in the boat!

22
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:48,162
Hey! How are you grandpa?

23
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:54,250
What happened? You don't seem
to be happy to see us.

24
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:57,715
It's enough, Boria,

25
01:16:57,921 --> 01:16:59,721
don't bother this old man.

26
01:17:01,704 --> 01:17:05,250
Grandpa, have you got anything to drink?

27
01:17:09,516 --> 01:17:12,000
I have some wine...

28
01:17:13,097 --> 01:17:15,150
God bless you!

29
01:18:50,209 --> 01:18:52,150
Here's to us.

30
01:19:08,346 --> 01:19:09,750
To us!

31
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,250
You are a good man, grandpa!

32
01:19:19,504 --> 01:19:22,054
The wine is good, 
but there isn't much.

33
01:19:42,103 --> 01:19:43,000
Enough.

34
01:19:45,536 --> 01:19:47,250
God bless us.

35
01:19:48,384 --> 01:19:50,350
A toast to you grandpa.

36
01:20:15,550 --> 01:20:18,350
You accommodated here very well,
you know?

37
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:37,750
Won't you tell what 
you are looking for?

38
01:20:38,150 --> 01:20:40,750
The dog escaped from us,
the dog!

39
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:45,050
But, he's wounded, he can't run away,
be attentive, we'll be back soon.

40
01:23:27,450 --> 01:23:29,000
Hello (in Russian)

41
01:23:31,350 --> 01:23:33,150
We're looking for a friend

42
01:23:34,650 --> 01:23:38,750
If you are not looking for us,
then you are not in the right place.

43
01:23:40,150 --> 01:23:42,950
It means you haven't seen
anyone around here?

44
01:23:52,150 --> 01:23:53,980
Ok, I understood, goodbye.

45
01:25:09,350 --> 01:25:10,650
Come here, come!
