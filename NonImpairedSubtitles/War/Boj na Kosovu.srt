00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,390
AT THE END OF THE 14TH CENTURY

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:18,234
TURKS FROM ASIA MINOR
STARTED TO CONQUER EUROPE.

3
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,352
THE SERBIAN MEDIEVAL STATE
RESISTED THIS INVASION.

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,593
THE BATTLE OF KOSOVO

5
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,115
Based on the novel of
Ljubomir Simovic

6
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,957
Prince Lazar
Milos Zutic

7
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,595
Princess Milica
Gorica Popovic

8
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,468
Vuk Brankovic
Vojislav Brajovic

Miloc Obilic
Zarko Lausevic

10
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,599
Big Danube fish!
Sterlets! Pike perches!

11
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:00,230
Directed by
Zdravko Sotra

12
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,112
Hey, monk!

13
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,198
Does this path lead to Kosovo?
-Yes. And that one too

14
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,748
and the one from which you came.
What are you wondering?

15
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,874
Every path leads there.

16
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:23,913
There is no other path today in Serbia
then the one leading to Kosovo or from Kosovo.

17
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:43,555
In the time of prince Dusan, Serbia
was reflecting in the water of 3 seas.

18
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,118
After his death it shrunk to
3 river alleys.

19
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,559
From the 3 seas we have only
Pomoravje left and Murat wants that as well

20
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:00,831
It would be best, if we could tear 
up this Murat letter

21
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,558
and forget about it.
-No, Spiridon.

22
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:09,272
This letter
isn't our only problem.

23
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:12,434
The best thing would be if we 
were unanimous.

24
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,679
Then we wouldn't fear Murat,
Murat would fear us.

25
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,639
If we were unanimous, the sultan
wouldn't dare demand from us

26
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:31,519
that we were obedient, give him
the army and pay for the haradj.

27
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:37,270
You can't demand this from a state,
a country can't accept this.

28
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,076
Did you decline his demands?
-What else would I do?

29
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,195
Did Murat get your answer already?
-Yes.

30
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,599
And he's responding. The Turkish army
already broke into the territory of

31
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:58,558
Vuk Brankovic and headed 
towards Lab in Sitnica.

32
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,709
To Kosovo. -To Kosovo.

33
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,230
The armies will clash on Kosovo
at Vid's day.

34
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,799
Is Murat coming with a large army?

35
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:24,315
They say it's so big,
you can hear it from 2 hours of walk away.

36
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:28,874
Toplica and Kosancic will inform us
about the army strength.

37
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,469
Who do you count on Lazar?

38
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,798
Our son-in-law Vuk Brankovic
is with us.

39
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,436
You're gonna fight a pack of lions
with one wolf?

40
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:43,356
Where is our other son-in-law?
Where is Djuradj II Balsic,

41
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,917
the master of Zeta and Pomoravje?
Will Djuradj come?

42
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,631
You know that because of Trebinje,
Konavlja and god knows what else,

43
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:56,919
he's in conflict with Bosnia. He attacked Bosnia
together with the Turks.

44
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:59,839
How could he defend Serbia
from the Turks?

45
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,278
Will at least king
Tvrtko I. Kotromanic come?

46
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:09,475
He sent the detachment under the command
of duke Vlatko Vukovic.

47
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,038
He's sending a duke instead of coming himself.
Why did he crown himself

48
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:19,792
with the Nemanjici crown,
if he doesn't have time to defend the Serbs?

49
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:34,596
Trouts, eels,
big Danube fish!

50
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,718
Carps, pikes, sheatfish!

51
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:42,836
Trouts, sheatfish, pike perches!

52
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,834
Fresh Danube fish!

53
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:57,598
Kosovo, Kosovo!
All you talk about is Kosovo.

54
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,392
They say our destiny is at stake
on Kosovo.

55
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,108
It's Kosovo for me each day.

56
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,996
Why are they so afraid of the Turks?

57
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,353
They're not grasshoppers.
- They're the cruelest army.

58
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:20,798
They steal wool, cloth, cattle.
They burn down houses. They burn down clouds.

59
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,911
Supposedly they don't eat pork.
-They rape girls and boys.

60
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:30,234
They turn churches into
stables and mosques.

61
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,671
Do they eat fish?
-They impale people alive.

62
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:38,909
Are you deaf? Do they eat fish?
-What? -Do Turks eat fish?

63
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:44,280
I think so. Why do you ask?
-Why do I ask?

64
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,912
Trouts, eels, carps,
sterlets! Fresh Danube fish!

65
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,231
When you sent Murat 
the responding letter,

66
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:01,232
you surely took thought before replying.
-You think I don't know what I have?

67
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,033
I know I'm not Emperor Dusan the Mighty.

68
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:12,995
We have nowhere to run. We must defend
what we have left.

69
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:19,029
Look how divided Serbia is
and what Serbian magnates are doing.

70
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,992
To preserve power,
they would rather turn Turks

71
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:27,990
then attack them with you.
Who will you gather when everything is falling to pieces?

72
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:33,278
Everyone would like to be some kind
of king and crown their

73
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,519
empty head. Even as small as
a thimble as long as it's a crown.

74
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:43,318
As small as it is, as long as it's
a kingdom.

75
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:49,514
Every village is a capital,
every cottage a palace.

76
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,113
Murat isn't coming with such an 
army to negotiate.

77
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,878
He wants more then he said.
Even if he made an agreement with me,

78
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,754
the army would rip him to pieces

79
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,749
if he wanted to send it back home without
a fight and prey.

80
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,113
I have nothing left to do then gather
as much strength as I have left.

81
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,439
I will gather the army, you assemble the
metropolitans and vladikas,

82
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:24,552
archimandrites, monks,
priests and deacons

83
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,000
from all the churches and cloisters
from all over Serbia,

84
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:34,513
so they give communion to our army 
before the battle.

85
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,953
This will be our great suffering.
-I know.

86
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,108
We will suffer one way or the other.
But we can choose.

87
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:18,116
Either we die crawling like
Turkish slaves or turned Turks

88
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,273
or we die honorably.
There is no other alternative.

89
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,069
You will not return alive from Kosovo.
 - Better to be remembered by our grandchildren

90
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,630
as dead then be forgotten 
while still alive.

91
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,713
Of all the black clouds
above Serbia

92
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,959
this one is neither the first nor the
blackest. -Are you returning to Zica?

93
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,597
There is no time.
I'll go to Mojsinje since it's closer.

94
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,952
I'll send the messages to the monks 
from there.

95
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,193
We'll reach Kosovo in time.
 -Are you coming?

96
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:55,549
I also want to earn my divine grace.

97
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,919
May God be with you.

98
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,596
May God bestow us with his
mercy

99
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:12,277
not only with the suffering but also with
a victory in Kosovo.

100
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:16,034
God bless you.

101
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:38,033
Find me a fat carp.

102
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:44,677
Will this one do? -Hit him on the
head with a mallet.

103
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,992
This one would be an ornament even on
a princely table. -Tonight it will be an ornament on mine.

104
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,789
If I have to die tomorrow
like a dog

105
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:58,719
I'll be at least eating today as
prince.

106
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,794
Are you going to Kosovo too?
-This calamity concerns us all.

107
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,238
They really must be in trouble 
if they're calling for you. -Oh, yeah.

108
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:12,468
Like never before. -There were wars
and battles, but nothing like this.

109
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,112
All the blacksmith's workshops and smelteries
are working. Yesterday an iron wheel

110
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:23,395
broke, today a silver one snapped.
 -Where? -In the mine.

111
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:28,271
Because of overweight.
-They have to forge so many swords,

112
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:32,354
there won't be a spoonful of iron left.

113
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,552
Nobody ask themselves who pays for
all those swords.

114
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:38,593
It's common knowledge. The prince.
-I'm paying.

115
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,471
You're supplying his army?
-Of course. -Tomorrow on Kosovo

116
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,037
we'll be paying with lives.

117
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:53,914
What kind of D is this? Even a literate
person wouldn't know if it's a D or A.

118
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,229
Mr. Vuk Brankovic...
-Am I intruding?

119
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,194
No. We have finished.

120
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:10,119
Until I order otherwise no one should see
these dinars.

121
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:15,992
Not even for the price of a life.
They won't be put in circulation for now.

122
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:20,796
Dinars with moulds are locked up
in 7 iron boxes,

123
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:26,473
and those are in the chest of your
treasury. The keys are...

124
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:33,473
You should shut your moth.
I know where they're locked.

125
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,789
Get lost.

126
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,868
Are you coining new dinars?

127
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,996
The summer has only started and it's
already hot at night.

128
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:55,239
Kosovo will obviously cost you
dear. -More then that.

129
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,912
Equipping such an army with 
men at arm, horses and infantrymen

130
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,755
can nowadays reduce a country to
poverty.

131
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:07,953
As always it's my concern.
What concern brought you?

132
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,873
I have come to warn you
to support Lazar

133
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,873
with everything you have got.
-Why should I support him?

134
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,756
Because Serbia never was in bigger danger
then today.

135
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:30,113
And with her all the Christian world,
not just the Orthodox.

136
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:34,878
Lazar is the only one that can
save Serbia and Christianity.

137
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,756
So Krusevac doesn't become the new
Constantinople.

138
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,317
You can see Cviljan and Kaljaja
from your window

139
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,279
and Jerusalem from his.

140
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,716
You talk as though you were
Lazar's brother and not my own.

141
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:57,069
You think there is no other head
then Lazar's,

142
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:02,355
no other way for the existence of
Serbia, except Lazar's way?

143
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:09,275
Among the weak magnates, only Lazar is
the one with the vision.

144
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,034
I have no vision?
-You? What vision do you have?

145
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:21,837
This room measures
6 x 10 meters.

146
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,199
That pine tree is 30 meters high.

147
00:16:31,400 --> 00:16:36,030
This barrel can carry 200 liters.
This bull weighs 700 kg.

148
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:45,153
The bell strikes 4 times at 4 o'clock,
and 7 times at 7 o'clock.

149
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:52,118
That is my vision. The snake is poisonous,
the peach is sweet

150
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:56,837
and wormwood is bitter.
Serbs are few, Turks are many.

151
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,918
Why are you looking at me?
-You call that a vision?

152
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,714
What vision does Lazar have?
-Vision of Serbia.

153
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:11,237
And Serbian unity.
-What?

154
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:14,557
He's smart enough to know that he could
hardly unite the Serbs,

155
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:18,036
if he wanted to subordinate all the
Serbian magnates

156
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:22,990
and proclaim himself as the Tsar,
as many wanted.

157
00:17:25,680 --> 00:17:28,035
I most certainly didn't.

158
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:37,555
Who chose Kosovo as the
battlefield? You or Murat?

159
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:42,312
Neither Murat or me.
Kosovo chose itself.

160
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:45,229
Can it be seen from here?

161
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,638
No, but one knows where it is.
-Where?

162
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,199
You see that splendor in the sky?
-I see.

163
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,879
Kosovo is directly underneath it.

164
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,755
That's dusk.

165
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,719
What's your name, you say?
-Makarij.

166
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,518
Brother Makarij?
-That's right.

167
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:20,520
Did you paint all those Lazar's
churches? -Almost all of them.

168
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,637
I was returning from St.Petka
to Vojnovica when they told me

169
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:34,636
that the patriarch is in Mojsinje
and is assembling all the clergy

170
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,795
in Kosovo so that the army gets 
its communion before the battle.

171
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,596
How do you find the way?
-The eyes aren't the only sense of sight.

172
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:49,995
Without my eyes with these old hands
I can see how April dawn

173
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:54,393
is changing to July evening
and November dusk.

174
00:18:55,040 --> 00:19:01,798
Father Teofan, we are lost.
I don't know anymore from where we came

175
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:06,233
and where we're heading.
-Let's follow this way.

176
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,035
You blind man will show me the way?
-The fog is troubling you because you see it

177
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:19,157
and I don't see it so it doesn't 
bother me. Are you coming or not?

178
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,718
Guards! Does this path lead to Kosovo?
-Why are you asking?

179
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,109
Will you fight too? You don't look
like a knight nor a solider.

180
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:52,279
I'm not a soldier. I'm a medicus,
et chirurgico et barberius

181
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,798
de Prezarin. -What are you?
-Doctor, surgeon and barber

182
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:01,352
from Prizren. - How come you don't
know the path to Kosovo?

183
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,628
I know the way from Prizren,
now I'm coming from Resava.

184
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,399
What are you doing in Kosovo if
you're not a soldier? -What am I doing?

185
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:15,076
You know how many punctured
liver, lungs,

186
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:19,677
scattered guts and brains,
broken hands and feet,

187
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:25,319
broken ribs, crushed skulls,
broken fingers and spines,

188
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:30,429
dug out eyes and broken
bones, shot through throats

189
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:35,435
and jaws will there be in Kosovo? There will be
enough blood to sail on it with boats.

190
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:39,190
Is anyone paying you to 
talk this way? - Do you think

191
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:43,399
that the Turks will welcome us with
pilaf and baklavas?

192
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:48,549
Anyone who hears your stories will
never go to Kosovo.

193
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,277
What you do have in the bags?
-Books and medicine.

194
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,677
What kind of books?
-Medical.

195
00:20:56,000 --> 00:21:00,516
Instructions for healing wounds.
-And this? Empty it.

196
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:06,478
These are medicines and balsams.
Don't shake it, you'll break everything.

197
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,590
Who will pick this up?
-Look, you fart.

198
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:17,029
I use it to wash my ears.
I put the nib for the tube over here

199
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:24,596
and extract the liquid from the ears.
-What do you have in this bag? -Cheese

200
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:27,270
Open it.

201
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,589
Close it.

202
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:36,037
He has a mortar.
-To rub medicine in.

203
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,710
Are these medical books too?
-No, those are for prophecy.

204
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:43,475
Can you predict what will happen
in Kosovo from these books?

205
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:46,797
You can see that without the books.
-What can you see?

206
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,396
When everyone takes something from Serbia,
the kingdom, dukedom,

207
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,155
princedom, tyrantdom,
and sums up all the taken

208
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:58,916
we all end up with nothing.
-Tie him up.

209
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,909
What are you doing?

210
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,556
You are neither the first nor the
last Turkish spy that we have caught.

211
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,628
I'm not a spy.
I'm a medicine man. A doctor.

212
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:20,679
Obilic, God himself has sent you!
-Why did you tie him up?

213
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:24,230
Because he's a Turkish spy, sir.
-How do you know that?

214
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,552
He says that Turks will chop off
our heads in Kosovo.

215
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,637
Won't they?

216
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:33,117
He says that the Serbian empire has fallen in ruins.
-Hasn't it?

217
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,239
He says that the magnates are responsible
for it. - Aren't they?

218
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:41,115
You're raising unpleasant sub questions, sir.

219
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,551
His only crimes is that he sees that the
empire has fallen,

220
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:48,874
he knows why it has fallen, because of who it has
fallen and is crazy enough to say it loud.

221
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:52,232
Master do you remember the battle
at Plocnik, when prince Lazar

222
00:22:52,520 --> 00:23:00,108
defeated Murat? -Is that you?
-It's me. -A doctor? -From Prizren.

223
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:04,868
He healed my wound over there.
Untie him.

224
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:08,755
We will when we get the order from
our master Vuk Brankovic,

225
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,635
the master of Kosovo. -My respect to
Vuk Brankovic.

226
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,310
If you have unsheathed the sword,
use it to cut the rope.

227
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:22,875
Be careful not to cut him.
Now sheathe the sword.

228
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:30,439
The rope was too tight.
An idiot is just an idiot.

229
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:34,315
Are you talking about me?
-You better leave your sword put!

230
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:42,794
Be careful with that iron ware of yours.
Obilic is an excellent swordsman.

231
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:51,195
I'll feed you alright,
with wooden pears.

232
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:00,676
How much would Lazar's vision be worth in Kosovo
tomorrow

233
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,833
without my army?
- Lazar also has a large army.

234
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:09,518
Larger then anyone else in Serbia
could assemble.

235
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,913
It is large, but it isn't sufficient enough.

236
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:18,559
You can say that it has Obilic,
the hero of all heroes.

237
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:23,718
He likes him too much. -There is a
reason Obilic has such a good reputation.

238
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:28,119
Is that the reason you came from Atos, so
you can throw Obilic at me?

239
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:36,560
You mentioned him, not me.
You jump when his name is mentioned.

240
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:42,111
What do you hold against Obilic?
What harm has he done you?

241
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:45,479
Why are you so opposed to him?

242
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,591
Is everyone asking you what will
happen in Kosovo?

243
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,350
Only fools don't see what will
happen. -And you see it?

244
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:56,598
Wolf and dog snouts are
snapping at the people,

245
00:24:56,880 --> 00:25:02,273
and the people don't know where to go.
You know what kind of a herd 

246
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,235
the Serbian people are? If it takes
seven sheep to pasture,

247
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,990
it will lose eight of them. -What do
you know about Serbian people

248
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:13,317
and Serbian shepherds ?
-I just know 

249
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:16,990
that Serbia is doomed with
shepherds like that.

250
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:24,994
A raven with a rat could rule Serbia
from a thatch.

251
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,999
My dear Bogoj, you have been reading unwritten
books and forgot about the written ones.

252
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,119
You could have read in these books that

253
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:39,638
the twice baptized great Serbian mayor
Stevan Nemanja was also a shepherd.

254
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,398
And his son Stefan the first-crowned 
and St. Sava.

255
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,515
And Stefan Uros II, king
Milutin, Stefan Dusan the Mighty,

256
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,879
Serbian Tsar.
You could have seen and read,

257
00:25:55,160 --> 00:26:00,393
that these shepherds didn't lose
their sheep. The Serbian people with them

258
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:04,309
weren't a flock of sheep bleatingly going
to the slaughterhouse.

259
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:08,997
Even lions retreated from them. 
With that in your mind

260
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:13,313
you could see what will happen.
What will happen,

261
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,438
is that even today a shepherd will be found in
Kosovo before whom those will

262
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:20,190
retreat that haven't retreated from no one
else before.

263
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:23,955
Even Mura and his son,
that degenerate of a dog.

264
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:29,308
And a sun will, even if after a hundred of
years,

265
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:36,073
chase away the ravens and the rats
and it will warm up and shine on Serbia.

266
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:41,071
If we strike it today.

267
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,510
Master.

268
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,234
What is it?

269
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,517
Why are you bothering me?
-He has to speak with you.

270
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,837
What is this now? Is this a village
crossing or a palace?

271
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:59,316
I have urgent and important news.
-Gerasim, wait for me.

272
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,439
Something happened.
Let the bartender pour you a cup of wine.

273
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,948
White or red?
-Red, half a cup.

274
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:13,236
What is this guard's name?
-This is the commander of Vuk's sentry.

275
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,228
Paramunac. He has his net spread all over
Serbia.

276
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,720
You shouldn't have tried because of
me.

277
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:25,033
One doesn't know here, what someone thinks
and what someone is preparing because of something.

278
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,715
Leave Turks and Kosovo.
Leave them alone and find a doctor.

279
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:34,834
It's like looking for a needle in a haystack.
-I want to know where he was,

280
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:38,914
whom he met and what he did.
-Ok. -Wait.

281
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:43,399
Buy yourself some wine. You've deserved it.
-On command.

282
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,275
I didn't know this doctor was so
important to you.

283
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:52,352
I don't understand something. If you're
coining money for the battle as you say

284
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:56,553
why don't you allow it to go in 
circulation? Why are you locking it up,

285
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,469
when you need it most?
Why can't anyone see it?

286
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:05,038
Not even for the price of a life. And what is of more
importance to you today then Kosovo?

287
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:10,230
What does your silver money mean?
Is it the sun,

288
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:14,195
setting for Lazar
and rising for Vuk?

289
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,353
Too many questions at once.

290
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:24,991
3 by 3 we 
step on flat Kosovo

291
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:32,074
We're going to meet our destiny,
farewell mother, sister...

292
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,229
I'm looking at the cloud above Kopaonik.
It's so big and black

293
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:42,674
as though Judgment Day is coming.
-We live between two frontiers .

294
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:46,874
One is dropping 
deep into the clothy darkness,

295
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:50,755
the other is rising to the 
silky light.

296
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,709
The upper glaring frontier is
constantly avoiding us,

297
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:59,277
the lower one is following us
and lurking.

298
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:04,877
I thought you knew this frontier.
-I hear that for the first time.

299
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:11,595
When one trespasses this frontier, you start to
grow feathers or scales,

300
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:16,510
a shepherd becomes a sheep,
fisherman a fish,

301
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:21,072
people turn into mice,
bugs or snakes.

302
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,116
You see that frontier? -I see it.
-Do you see over it?

303
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,034
I wish I didn't.

304
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:34,469
Could you teach me to look over
that frontier?

305
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,989
Could you teach me?

306
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:47,875
You wouldn't want that once you heard
the price for it.

307
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:55,356
What is it? -Cross yourself.
The price is your eyesight.

308
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:14,877
When my dear heard I was leaving,
she gave me a marigold

309
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:34,429
Farewell, my first unborn son,
farewell rose in rosemary

310
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:42,310
farewell summer, autumn, winter,
we're leaving, but we will not return.

311
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:54,389
I accompany him at the golden doors,
receive at the muddy...

312
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,278
Shut up. Don't bring bad luck.
- He won't return from Kosovo alive.

313
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,949
Shut up. He'll return.

314
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:08,314
What land, what bird...
-Drink a bit of water.

315
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:14,872
what river will be your fiancee
-He doesn't want a drop of water.

316
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,634
You should thank God you're not saying
farewell to your son or brother.

317
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:23,708
What is wrong with her? -Her fiancee
went to Kosovo.

318
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:28,835
And hence such sorrow? -Even you would
long for Milan Toplica.

319
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,595
He went to spy in the Turkish camp.
- I accompanied to Kosovo 

320
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:36,395
my father, son, both husbands
and four brothers

321
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:43,631
and all my uncles and cousins,
yet I am still alive and am not moaning.

322
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:48,154
And she's making such a fuss because
of her fiancee.

323
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:53,309
Then I should die from sadness.
 -You have no idea how she suffers..

324
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,319
She'll forget him soon.

325
00:31:57,760 --> 00:32:02,072
Some gold and five reels of thread
will do it.

326
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:22,591
Why did Lazar assemble us?
-The last consultation before the battle.

327
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:26,032
I fear this battle will cost
us dearly.

328
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:29,477
I would have something to say 
about that. -All has already been said.

329
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,555
It's too late for words.
Words have become an army.

330
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:39,273
Why should Lazar decide in the name
of all of us? Since when does his authority

331
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:47,280
reach into our lands? -Who is he
to decide in my own land?

332
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,910
He was given power with the resolution
of the parliament.

333
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:57,716
And the Church supports him. -Because
the patriarch is Lazar's man.

334
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:03,910
Lazar bribes him by building
churches all over Pomoravje.

335
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,794
Hey, soldier!

336
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,117
Is this the way to Kosovo? -No.

337
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:19,788
Then I am lost. -No.
You have arrived. -Is this Kosovo?

338
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,670
You're loaded as a Dubrovnik
caravan.

339
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:27,396
Do you have silk and spices?
-No, balsams and medicines.

340
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:34,473
Is something bothering you as well?
-Something has been bothering me, for a longer time

341
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:40,028
But it can be cured with a bowl of
lentils.

342
00:33:41,320 --> 00:33:45,552
Why didn't you say before?
Here, take it, eat. -What is this?

343
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,274
Cheese. Just eat.

344
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,557
How come it's hairy ? -Because I have
been carrying it in a bag made of goat skin.

345
00:33:56,760 --> 00:34:01,038
It looks more like a badger then cheese.
-Then leave it if you don't want it.

346
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:08,276
Why are you constantly looking back?
-Me? Why would I?

347
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:13,232
Why do you have the hairy side turned inside
instead out outside?

348
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,958
You're not hungry.
-Of course I am. -Shut up.

349
00:34:25,600 --> 00:34:28,273
What is it? -Keep silent!

350
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:35,233
We musn't tell prince Lazar about this
-Why not?

351
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,398
If we tell him what we saw in the 
Turkish camp,

352
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,552
he might get scared, have his doubts 
and give up on the battle.

353
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:45,036
If he gave up on the battle,
if he surrendered in and submitted,

354
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:50,035
what would be of Serbia when Asia
flood her without any resistance?

355
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,835
And what do you think we should tell him?
-We wont tell him

356
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:57,038
that we saw janissaries, we'll tell him
we saw ripplers and sieve makers.

357
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:01,159
Instead of cavalry we'll mention
combers, saddlers and leather merchants.

358
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,709
We'll tell him the truth.

359
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,476
If you insist on that the prince's dinner will
go down the wrong way.

360
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:11,838
Better then our breakfast going down the
wrong way tomorrow. Hurry up.

361
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:16,473
Why are we hiding from our own people?
-If she saw us,

362
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,797
she wouldn't tell how large
of an army is in Kosovo.

363
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:24,278
I saw her even without them.
If Serbia was on balance

364
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:30,709
with Kosovo, it would rise high in the air,
and Kosovo would sink.

365
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:35,233
That big is the army in Kosovo.
I've been sitting here for 2 days

366
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:40,799
and watching. If only the wind
didn't blow from the Turkish side.

367
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:47,396
I'm feeling sick from all the suet smell.
Even the basilica smells of it.

368
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,236
That's because the Turks prepare
everything with suet.

369
00:35:51,520 --> 00:35:58,710
Baklava's, pilaf, pies.
Even candles. -At least I don't eat candles.

370
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,151
Serbia is ruled by the priests, not Lazar.
It's full of  black frocks .

371
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:19,674
Be careful what you say.
-Only the prince could silence me

372
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:26,399
not his nephew. -If your father
didn't teach you order,

373
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:31,311
this sword would teach you,
if we weren't here.

374
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,876
Are we gonna fight against the Turks
or are fighting among ourselves?

375
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,311
I didn't come to negotiate with the prince's
nephews,

376
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:41,876
I have come to see this man, that signs himself

377
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:46,119
as Christ Lord sovereign of Serbia,

378
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:51,031
Stefan, prince Lazar,
to put some sense into his head.

379
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:55,034
Let him withdraw the army from Kosovo,
let him not fight but negotiate.

380
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:01,313
You can negotiate about the head,
but not the honour.

381
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:06,710
I know why you don't want to go to battle.
You think your lands

382
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,913
are far away from Kosovo. But Kosovo
will be in your lands tomorrow.

383
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:14,396
People stronger then you have 
acknowledged Turkish authority. -Who are you?

384
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,713
King Marko, despot Dejanovic.
-Stronger, you say.

385
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:22,993
And what have they done with this authority?
Did they return the Altamanovic

386
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:27,358
lands or did I? Who turned the defeated
and divided Serbia into

387
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:34,312
a principality which will, if God gives,
become an empire again?

388
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:40,631
When everyone was squandering, who was gathering?
Marko, Konstantin

389
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,435
or Lazar? -They have avoided
the bloodshed

390
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:49,754
preserved the land and the people.
-They preserved their crowns.

391
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:53,315
At least they think so.

392
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,909
When your farmers will be leaving bones
in Kosovo with you

393
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,677
their's will be peacefully harvesting wheat.
-So they pay the Turks for the haradj.

394
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:09,673
So they will starve in peace. We must defend
ourselves from such peace.

395
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:16,110
Don't talk to me about farmers. You
don't care about the farmers not about Serbia.

396
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,315
You don't care if your lands will be tomorrow
under Hungary

397
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,115
or under Turkey. All you care about is
that you have a crown on your head,

398
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,439
gold in your purse and cloth
in the chests . -That's not true.

399
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,997
The truth will be proven in Kosovo,
not here.

400
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:37,074
Did you come to fight or talk?
-We have come to talk about

401
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:40,670
whether it is worth fighting for.
-It's not about

402
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,469
whether we want to fight,
it's about our existence.

403
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,514
Does existence to you mean bowing to
Murat's servants, cooks

404
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,715
and ostlers and kissing 
Murat's shoe?

405
00:38:56,520 --> 00:39:01,275
The Turkish might is too big.
-Your fear is too big.

406
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:06,551
Shall we let fear destroy everything 
we have achieved?

407
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:11,119
If we don't rise in the air like hawks
over the Turks today,

408
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:15,832
we will have chickens cackling in the
palace tomorrow.

409
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:31,991
You were long among the Turks.
-Longer then we expected.

410
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,555
What have you to say?
-Unfortunately nothing good.

411
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:40,310
The Turkish army is all
over Kosovo.

412
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:44,673
With one wing they're holding Lab,
with the other Sitnica.

413
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:50,791
They even have a tent-city with
streets, workshops

414
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:57,110
and stores. There's at least
twice as many of them as us.

415
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:01,999
You aren't exaggerating?
-There's 50.000 of Janissaries.

416
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:06,916
30.000 lancers,
60.000 infantrymen,

417
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:12,030
20.000 troopers.
-There are only 70.000 Serbs.

418
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:16,871
If only we got the promised 
balisters and bombards.

419
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:20,357
The army is big but it's 
assembled from all kinds of places.

420
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:24,559
Quantity instead of strength.
Idlers, not soldiers.

421
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,231
I wouldn't say they are idlers,
nor that they would be from all kinds of places.

422
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,752
The Turkish army is well selected, 
skillful,

423
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:38,113
well armed
and excellently paid.

424
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,235
Your reports are different.
One says white the other black.

425
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:49,869
Does one want to make me happy or
the other scare me?

426
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:54,878
I'd rather believe Kosancic.
-So you would retreat before the Turkish might

427
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,790
and return to your
peaceful lands?

428
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:05,230
I know he wave to attack the Turks
but not blindly.

429
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,351
The Sultan brought the armies
from Rumelia and Anatolia,

430
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:18,753
his sons Jakub and Bajazit
and his best generals.

431
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:24,118
It is not a usual battle for them.
-And it is for us?

432
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:30,434
For them it's a holy war.
-Isn't it for us as well?

433
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:36,229
Anything else important?
-Yes, noble prince.

434
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:39,557
The Turkish army has Serbs
and Greeks from Epir and Tesalia.

435
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:43,628
There is a very influential Serb in Murat's
court. -Hamza?

436
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:47,037
Turkish vassals but Christian
soldiers and knights.

437
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,757
Fear the Christian sword 
more then the Turkish sabre.

438
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:57,871
We heard the report from Kosovo.
The Turks are as they are.

439
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:03,312
Let's see how we stand.
-If it's true as Kosancic says,

440
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:06,672
that there's twice as many of Turks
then us...

441
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,118
Whether or not I go to battle doesn't 
depend on the strength of the enemy

442
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:15,512
but based on the sacred thing
that I defend.

443
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,437
Hey, are you sleeping?
-No, I'm dreaming.

444
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:24,753
I sat on the beach of Morava.
-And what were you doing?

445
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:33,830
I was watching ships loaded with 
fish and watermelons. -Will you have some cheese?

446
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,910
This cheese of yours
is more hairy then a bear.

447
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,472
As though he was eating me.
-As you wish.

448
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:48,712
How do you distinguish them?
-What? -The cheese and fur coat.

449
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:54,520
Do you ever wear the cheese
and have fur coat for dinner?

450
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:59,910
You will wake me at night when you won't
be able to sleep because of hunger.

451
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:04,916
You get fever and hallucinations from hunger.

452
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,994
Sit down, gentlemen.

453
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:39,679
Tonight the table is monastic 
not princely.

454
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:44,431
There is no boar-meat, hare's meat,
venison and chamois meat.

455
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:47,912
Not because we wouldn't have good
hunters and cooks,

456
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,357
but because we have to say hungry
and sober.

457
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,558
This is more of a Holy Communion
then a dinner. We will eat

458
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:58,829
what Christ ate, because tomorrow
we are Christ's soldiers.

459
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,395
Gentlemen, let's pray.

460
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,677
Let us have nothing else
then a grain of salt

461
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:13,830
but let everything be salted with it.
When water and fire

462
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:21,515
take everything from us, let that grain be
our everything. Amen. -Amen.

463
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:40,393
I raise my first cup to the soldiers,
the first toast to the first of them.

464
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:47,272
If I had another Obilic in the army I
would sleep even peacefully.

465
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:53,958
I want to make a toast too, prince.
But I would like to start with the last one.

466
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,069
If you recognize the first one in him,

467
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:02,520
my toast does not disprove
yours. Let me please,

468
00:45:02,800 --> 00:45:06,395
the first to make a toast 
contrary to the usual custom.

469
00:45:06,680 --> 00:45:09,592
What does this mean? -In Kosovo there
won't be just

470
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:13,634
two countries, two nations
and two rulers fighting

471
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:19,632
but two continents, two religions,
two Gods. This will be your battle.

472
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:26,469
The one that betrays you is sitting tonight
behind your table.

473
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:32,796
Obilic, Vuk is looking at you.
-You're just imagining it.

474
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:37,832
I hope you're not joking.
-I'm obliged to say that I see

475
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:42,392
among those that have come on horseback to
Kosovo with us

476
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:47,117
those that eat with us, drink and talk
with us,

477
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:52,749
tomorrow they will rise their sabre against
us.

478
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:59,479
Obilic, Vuk is looking at you.
-Why would he be looking at me?

479
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:07,353
If your son-in-law is converting,
my new brother-in-law ,

480
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:11,238
and so many of Serbian gentlemen,

481
00:46:11,600 --> 00:46:15,878
why wouldn't some of your best soldiers?

482
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:20,319
Levcanin? -What? -Don't do you think that
Vuk is looking at me?

483
00:46:20,520 --> 00:46:22,875
Should he be?

484
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:28,753
Did Judas come to Kosovo
to earn his silver coins?

485
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:33,312
He's not asking me.
-I ask myself.

486
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:39,995
I ask myself, how do we
survive without... -Without what?

487
00:46:41,000 --> 00:46:45,835
If we have no grain, I don't know what else
that wouldn't melt or change nor in the river nor in the sea

488
00:46:46,120 --> 00:46:51,069
nor in the poison nor in the blood.

489
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,438
Which will also stay in heaven
what it was in hell.

490
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:58,434
Olive tree, vine, wheat,
everything would spring up from this grain,

491
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,429
if we had it. -Those that don't
have the grain don't have anything.

492
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:05,519
Some people would give their lives for it

493
00:47:06,920 --> 00:47:11,869
others would give away this holy grain...
For what, Obilic?

494
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:18,878
For pearly grain?
Or for Judas silver coins?

495
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:24,269
Or for a bowl of Murat's pilaf?

496
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:28,758
Vuk Brankovic!
You will swallow this pilaf.

497
00:47:29,000 --> 00:47:32,629
I'll use my sword to press it into
your lying mouth.

498
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:36,196
Don't draw the sword
behind my table.

499
00:47:36,480 --> 00:47:40,519
Do you allow your sons-in-law to

500
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:44,872
accuse honest people without any evidence?
-My word isn't enough?

501
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:49,073
Of course not. You have accused
the best among us

502
00:47:49,320 --> 00:47:53,438
using such words that you'll have
to answer with your head for each of them.

503
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,674
I'm not afraid of any pledge.
-I need evidence.

504
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:04,639
My guards have caught a Turkish spy between Toplico
and Lab.

505
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:10,434
He was scaring the soldiers saying
that the Turks would chop off their heads.

506
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:17,632
The guards tied him up when 
Milos Obilic appeared.

507
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:23,034
To cut a long story short.
As the guards have stated

508
00:48:23,320 --> 00:48:26,835
Obilic confirmed everything that
the spy talked about.

509
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:31,272
He said that the Serbian has
disintegrated

510
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:35,599
that the fight against the Turks is hopeless
and lost in advance.

511
00:48:36,080 --> 00:48:42,633
Then he attacked the guards with his sword
and freed the spy.

512
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:51,758
He wanted to kill the guards.
-He's not a Turkish spy,

513
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:56,069
he's a Serbian medicine man.
In the battle at Plocnik

514
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:59,471
he took care of my wound.
-Obilic wants to remind you

515
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:04,595
that he was wounded in battle. For that
he expects you to pay.

516
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:10,269
I don't sell my wounds. -You can't 
believe one single word more then

517
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:16,715
all of Obilic's battles.
-It is Vuk Brankovic's word.

518
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,833
Obilic also isn't just someone,
he's a Obilic.

519
00:49:22,080 --> 00:49:25,152
Because Vuk suspects Obilic,
I suspect Vuk.

520
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,995
It's not only about treason it's about
conspiracy -You're not saying...

521
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,398
We have spoken enough tonight.
Even a blind man can see the obvious.

522
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:37,597
It won't be hard for you to judge.

523
00:49:39,840 --> 00:49:43,150
How can I judge the one to whom I 
made the first toast?

524
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:47,116
But how can I not judge him,
if he is being accused by the one,

525
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:51,029
to whom I have my first-born daughter?

526
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,114
A detailed investigation would
be necessary

527
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:59,108
to find out the truth.
But there is not time for that.

528
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:02,710
The accuser was counting on that fact.

529
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,389
Do you have any evidence whatsoever
Obilic?

530
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:12,718
I do. Just that my evidence aren't
words

531
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:19,473
and my evidence is not here.
My evidence is in Kosovo.

532
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:26,111
I will prove myself with the evidence.
 -Would you tell us how will you do that?

533
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:31,468
We know how.
So he betrays us to Murat.

534
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:37,396
I swear before this
bread and wine,

535
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:41,548
before this living image of Jesus Christ

536
00:50:44,760 --> 00:50:48,230
that I will kill Murat tomorrow in 
Kosovo.

537
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:53,990
He's crazy.
-Obilic, do you know what you're saying?

538
00:50:54,280 --> 00:50:57,556
Tomorrow we all go to battle
with the fear of dying

539
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:01,150
and the hope of not dying.
If the person that went to the Turks

540
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:04,597
to kill Murat, cherished such a hope
he would be crazy.

541
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:08,549
If he didn't cherish such hope he 
would be crazy if he did go.

542
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:15,995
There is no question about it with Obilic.
Obilic doesn't care about hope,

543
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:21,269
because he knows that he and Murat will
be as alive tomorrow as they are today.

544
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:25,676
Who is that crazy to believe someone who
so easily makes such


545
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:30,829
a difficult oath?
Not me.

546
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:36,674
Vuk Brankovic, tomorrow the trail 
of everyone, of you and me

547
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,917
in Kosovo will be visible as in
snow.

548
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,232
On Vid's day we will see
who is who.

549
00:51:44,040 --> 00:51:46,998
And to you prince Lazar,

550
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:51,671
the one that slandered me at your place
to you, Serbian knights,

551
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:55,113
I will say only one thing.

552
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,000
You, prince Stefan Lazar,

553
00:51:59,840 --> 00:52:02,593
and you, Mr. Vuk Brankovic,

554
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,478
and you two,
brothers Stevan and Lazar Music,

555
00:52:06,760 --> 00:52:10,036
and you, Milan Toplica,
and you, Ivan Kosancic,

556
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:13,477
and you, Tamnavec,
and you, Levcanin,

557
00:52:13,960 --> 00:52:19,557
and all you other Serbian knights,
and me with and among you,

558
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:26,395
as we will be tomorrow,
we will be for all eternity.

559
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:44,638
I should have thrown him in jail.
-Obilic said

560
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:51,632
that he will kill Murat tomorrow,
so you should judge about the oath tomorrow.

561
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,429
Why did you all bow your heads?

562
00:52:56,160 --> 00:53:00,119
If Obilic has abandoned us
God has not.

563
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,789
You intend to go to Kosovo
without Obilic?

564
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:05,873
Whether or not I go to battle doesn't
depend on how

565
00:53:06,160 --> 00:53:09,994
strong my army is, it depends on the
sacred thing I defend.

566
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:16,677
We have no wine left.
I'll fetch another goblet. Here.

567
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:25,311
What kind of money is this?
-Silver dinar of Vuk Brankovic,

568
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:28,990
coined in Prizren. -Instead of
Lazar there's St. Stefan.

569
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,631
Why would Vuk do that?
-Show me.

570
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:44,799
Vuk probably asked himself what
so many marriages meant.

571
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:50,990
You mean Lazar's daughters?
Vuk now has 3 brothers-in-law.

572
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,679
Maybe Vuk asked himself,
whom Lazard would give Olivera.

573
00:53:55,920 --> 00:53:59,469
Maybe he'll give her to Obilic.
Vuk could also ask himself,

574
00:53:59,720 --> 00:54:04,999
who would rule Serbia if Lazar was to
fall in action in Kosovo tomorrow.

575
00:54:05,280 --> 00:54:10,673
Be careful witch, better stick to your
fish. Turn out the candle.

576
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:14,316
You don't want me to fetch the wine?
-Let me sleep.

577
00:54:14,600 --> 00:54:17,068
Who's singing at this time of hour?

578
00:54:19,040 --> 00:54:21,873
The army that is going to Kosovo.

579
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,999
The Communion in Kosovo
will start any minute now.

580
00:54:36,360 --> 00:54:40,512
We'll soon be there.
Promise to help me.

581
00:54:40,720 --> 00:54:44,190
They're already carrying the icons and banners
from the church.

582
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:48,519
I can't paint anything as long
as I don't see with my

583
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:53,874
clerical eyes as you do. -Everyone
is already over there except for us. -No they aren't.

584
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,989
What do you mean they aren't, if the whole of Kosovo
is glaring from the knight arms?

585
00:54:59,360 --> 00:55:02,989
Those aren't knights those are
fireflies and dew.

586
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:07,518
What do you have your eyes for?
Serbian knights are glaring in Kosovo

587
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:14,751
the most glaring of them is Lazar.

588
00:55:15,720 --> 00:55:20,840
Do I, blind man, have to show you
what is what?

589
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:31,191
I want to see the essence 
which is invisible to the human eye.

590
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:37,271
Did you forget that you would have to
sacrifice your bodily eyes,

591
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:42,429
to see with you your clerical eyes?
-I didn't.

592
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:48,636
Are you prepared to pay such price?
-How many times should I tell you?

593
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:55,073
The Patriarch's prayer will
start any minute.

594
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,835
When will I go blind?

595
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:39,352
I call and ask holy 
warriors Jurij and Dimitrij,

596
00:56:39,760 --> 00:56:45,357
St. Prokopij, St. Teodor
Tiron and Teodor Stratilat,

597
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:50,473
St.. Merkurij,
St. Artemij, St. Nikita...

598
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:55,072
Take a good look at all of this,

599
00:56:55,720 --> 00:57:00,669
because you're watching it for the very last time.

600
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:11,475
Support us and take us to
battle like reapers to harvest

601
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:17,676
and that we return from battle like reapers from harvest
with abundant bread.

602
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:26,475
Shine on us today, let heaven be filled 
with icons

603
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:31,635
on the holy banners.
Give us the strength,

604
00:57:32,360 --> 00:57:38,993
so we fight bravely for eternity and 
righteous life.

605
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:10,792
What are the Serbian priests singing?
-The liturgy.

606
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:15,119
You listened to it before the battle
at Plocnik. -I'm not trembling

607
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:22,318
from this singing but because of
the summer coldness.

608
00:58:24,680 --> 00:58:29,549
Do you feel that the moonlight smells of
linden and acacian honey today?

609
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:35,994
It smells to me more like wormwood.
-It doesn't matter anyway.

610
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:43,033
In less then an hour, everything,
from the moonlight and the wind,

611
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:47,872
Europe and Asia, the sky and 
the earth will smell of blood.

612
00:58:48,240 --> 00:58:53,872
I hope it will smell more of 
Serbian then Turkish blood.

613
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,998
You talking as though it weren't
two armies fighting,

614
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:02,635
but two planet.

615
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:13,429
You're not with the army yet, Jakub?
One question has been troubling me. -Again?

616
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:21,432
What question? -There are Serbian
aristocrats among us. -So what?

617
00:59:21,720 --> 00:59:25,759
How much can we trust them? Will
Serbs fight against other Serbs?

618
00:59:26,080 --> 00:59:31,791
How can someone be a brother to a stranger,
who is a stranger to his own brother?

619
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:36,194
If they betrayed their own,
they can betray us too.

620
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,115
The battle will already begin and end
and he'll still be asking questions.

621
00:59:40,440 --> 00:59:42,749
I didn't ask you.

622
00:59:44,440 --> 00:59:47,955
Its the easiest thing to do, to chop
off the defeated King's head,

623
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,199
but it's not the smartest thing to do.
It can still be of some use to you. How?

624
00:59:52,560 --> 00:59:55,757
Who crowned himself, cares more about the crown,

625
00:59:56,000 --> 01:00:00,152
then his head, so he would give his head
his people,

626
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,598
his country and faith for the crown, but he wouldn't
renounce his crown not even for his honour.

627
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:09,032
To retain this royal or princely 
crown

628
01:00:09,320 --> 01:00:13,757
they defend  more eagerly then the aga's
and bey's in their countries


629
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,276
the rights of our Islamic country
and faith.

630
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:22,753
If it is so, shouldn't we get Lazar
this way?

631
01:01:33,520 --> 01:01:36,990
The Serbian Communion has ended.

632
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:42,035
Their knights have gotten on horses.
-Everyone to your respective places.

633
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,551
The first Serbian blow will be the
strongest.

634
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,917
Did prince Lazar gallop before the army? -Yes.

635
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:53,118
His helmet with the horns can be 
seen from far away.

636
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:58,110
So we grab him with both hands by
the horns.

637
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:05,758
Bajazit, you better shut up and hurry.
The Serbian cavalry will attack.

638
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:45,315
Serbian and Turkish banners are mixed up.

639
01:04:45,920 --> 01:04:49,833
It didn't start as it should have.

640
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:31,191
What is happening to our front line?

641
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:35,035
The Serbs are penetrating it like
an iron waterfall.

642
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:38,272
Luckily there's our best infantry.

643
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:43,395
They must hold out the first wave of attacks.
-If it goes on like this, they won't.

644
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:46,595
Is this how you wage war?

645
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:52,398
What is happening there? -Serbian
men at arm have broken the infantry.

646
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:58,790
Where? -On the Jakuba
Celebija wing. -Impossible.

647
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:03,790
Our front line is retreating.
Second line is yielding.

648
01:06:04,200 --> 01:06:07,476
Go find Jakub at once.

649
01:06:47,640 --> 01:06:51,155
Where did those Serbian banners among the
tents come from?

650
01:06:51,520 --> 01:06:55,149
They reached our train.
-This is complete chaos.

651
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:59,109
The Serbs have stopped over there but Jakub
is almost totally battered.

652
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:02,596
Let Balaban transfer the janissaries
as soon as possible,

653
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:07,994
Stop this offensive and go into a
counterattack.

654
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:58,395
Bajazit Ilderim is informing us that he is
beating Vukovic's army,

655
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:03,196
that he separated it from the main body of the army
and is pushing it towards Lab.

656
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:06,552
Tell him to slower the offensive.
Let him wait,

657
01:08:06,800 --> 01:08:09,951
so Jakub pulls himself together
on the left wing.

658
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:14,438
Maybe Vukovic is leading him into a 
trap with the retreat.

659
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,996
His spear is inverted the wrong way.
-So he means to surrender.

660
01:08:29,240 --> 01:08:33,836
And who is that hero?
-Duke Milos Obilic.

661
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:57,715
Does anyone know anything about this Obilic?
-He's Lazar's best duke.

662
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:02,477
If he was the best we wouldn't
invert the spear the wrong way.

663
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,149
Bring him to me.

664
01:09:22,760 --> 01:09:25,832
Be careful, it may be a deception.

665
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,830
Accede and bow to the sultan.

666
01:09:48,080 --> 01:09:50,389
Noble sultan.

667
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,996
Don't you Serbs know how to approach
a Turkish sultan?

668
01:09:54,280 --> 01:09:58,034
How? -Kneel down and kiss
his shoe.

669
01:09:58,280 --> 01:10:01,989
I didn't come as a servant but as
a knight. -Kneel down!

670
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,389
Where is that doctor?
-Call Mustafa.

671
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:44,831
Why didn't you take his knife?
-I thought he only had a spear.

672
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:47,190
Call Bajazit!

673
01:10:50,240 --> 01:10:55,268
Is there any hope? -No way.
His abdomen is rip open.

674
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:59,999
You need a grave digger not a 
doctor. Move out of the way

675
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:02,674
Give him some air.

676
01:11:04,040 --> 01:11:07,271
Padishah opened his eyes.
He regained his consciousness.

677
01:11:07,480 --> 01:11:11,758
Soon he will close them forever.
Don't move, sultan.

678
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:16,837
Is that one alive? -He's alive.
-Say and he'll lose his head.

679
01:11:17,160 --> 01:11:19,435
Bring him to me.

680
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:34,510
Are you mad enough to think that my
death will determine the outcome of this battle?

681
01:11:35,120 --> 01:11:38,954
If it won't determine today's
it will determine tomorrow's.

682
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:44,593
What tomorrow's? You'll die
today. -Let him speak.

683
01:11:45,000 --> 01:11:49,755
Let it be known that Serbia is
a soft rug.

684
01:11:51,320 --> 01:11:54,471
That Kosovo is no silky pillow.

685
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:58,357
Serbs have something more dear to them
then their own life.

686
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:03,031
Dog! -Don't beat him tied up.
-But he's barking.

687
01:12:03,400 --> 01:12:07,552
Serbia isn't a handful of rice
for every crow that the wind brings.

688
01:12:07,840 --> 01:12:12,994
Leave the crow and rice alone.
Tell me, what is so precious

689
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:19,230
more precious then life. What did
you sacrifice your head for today?

690
01:12:19,600 --> 01:12:23,229
I gave my head for my word.

691
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:27,631
I can't laugh.

692
01:12:28,960 --> 01:12:34,034
Because you're paying with your head for
a word doesn't mean,

693
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:39,673
that your word is so precious 
but that your head is so cheap.

694
01:12:40,520 --> 01:12:45,116
If it wasn't for that word, what else would be
left? -Listen, boy.

695
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:49,871
In less then half an hour we'll both
be just worm food,

696
01:12:50,160 --> 01:12:57,430
despite your word and all
of my army.

697
01:13:52,240 --> 01:13:54,435
Is he alive?

698
01:13:54,720 --> 01:13:58,429
Are you badly wounded?
-I can't hold my guts with my hands.

699
01:14:09,080 --> 01:14:12,197
Is this the murderer? -Yes.
-What are you waiting for?

700
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:16,313
We're waiting for your decision, master.
-Chop off his head.

701
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:20,229
Did you notify Jakub?
-Not yet. We have waited for you.

702
01:14:20,480 --> 01:14:25,076
You're smart, Miralem.
I won't forget it.

703
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:32,070
Where are you taking him?
-To the oak tree. -Do it here.

704
01:14:32,320 --> 01:14:35,437
Let sultan see him die.

705
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:41,557
And you send someone for Jakub who still
doesn't know what has happened.

706
01:14:41,800 --> 01:14:45,759
He should tell him ,
that Murat is calling for him, not me.

707
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,390
Bogoje?

708
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,956
I'm no longer Bogoje,
but Mustafa

709
01:14:55,160 --> 01:14:58,516
I'm no longer Christian
but Muslim,

710
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:03,312
I'm no longer a doctor or
a medicus, but a Hakim.

711
01:15:03,720 --> 01:15:08,669
I don't visit a church anymore,
but a mosque. -For God's sake...

712
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:14,194
Don't wonder. Brankovic drove me
to another religion.

713
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,952
They have persecuted you,
so they could get me.

714
01:15:18,240 --> 01:15:22,472
They wanted to destroy me,
so they would take down Lazar.

715
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,718
Who is the hero that hit me?

716
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:32,469
Serb Hamza. -That's why he hits
also when it isn't necessary.

717
01:15:32,760 --> 01:15:36,912
No one trusts a turned Turk.
If a Turk is bleeding down to his elbows,

718
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:42,148
he must bleed to his shoulders. -You have
learned that fast, Mustafa.

719
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:46,832
Well Jaur, are you ready to 
meet your own God?

720
01:15:47,160 --> 01:15:50,994
I am. -Allah is merciful.
Maybe he will help you.

721
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:54,909
God will help me as i have not
renounced him.

722
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:58,112
All your bloodshed is in vain today.

723
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:02,472
I am drawing in borders with my blood.
-What border?

724
01:16:02,720 --> 01:16:06,918
The one between me and you.
-Cut the dog.

725
01:16:19,760 --> 01:16:22,399
Impale him on the spear.

726
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:24,949
Master, the Padishah is dying.

727
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:33,039
Your murderer is dead.
Look at him.

728
01:16:33,320 --> 01:16:37,074
Should I lift your head?
-I'm still alive,

729
01:16:37,440 --> 01:16:42,514
and I hear they're already calling
you master.

730
01:16:44,200 --> 01:16:46,395
Listen, Bajazit.

731
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:51,718
Don't forget that Jakub 
is your brother.

732
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,475
Don't worry. Be at ease.

733
01:16:58,120 --> 01:17:03,911
Does it hurt you much? -No.
But it is degrading.

734
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:12,672
I don't know why a man needs as much
intestine as a ram.

735
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:17,996
Don't let him talk so much.
-When will I talk, if not now?

736
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:25,552
Bajazit, don't forget that a brother
is sacred. Did you hear me?

737
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:32,032
I heard you.
-Save your strength

738
01:17:32,360 --> 01:17:36,876
and don't provoke hatred.
If you want to divide Serbia,

739
01:17:37,840 --> 01:17:43,312
rely only on the Serbs.
They will do a better job then you.

740
01:17:47,080 --> 01:17:52,473
Look, behind Kosovo there are churches
standing one behind another.

741
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:59,794
Studenica, Zica, Ravanica.
Behind these Serbian churches

742
01:18:00,360 --> 01:18:07,755
are German, Roman,
Florentine and Venetian churches.

743
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:15,630
And churches in Paris and Rouen.
Till where you hear the church bell,

744
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:21,630
till there you will have to unlatch the
arrow of Islam.

745
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:28,876
Do you remember Ali's bequest?
-He said:

746
01:18:29,160 --> 01:18:34,951
Torture the Jaurs wherever you can.
Better to look for them with your sabres

747
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:40,075
in their houses, then to wait for them
with the spoons in your own.

748
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:44,439
Your talk is in vain.
He doesn't hear you anymore.

749
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,389
He died.

750
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,278
Close his tent.

751
01:19:03,600 --> 01:19:08,435
The army musn't know about his death till
the end of the battle.

752
01:19:20,240 --> 01:19:22,879
I'm taking over the battle into my own hands.

753
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:41,078
What is happening? Why aren't you on 
the battlefield? Why is father calling for me?

754
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:45,831
He's altering the plan. -Why did he close the
tent? -Because of the heat.

755
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:52,752
Where does all this blood come from? -You're asking where
the blood comes from in the middle of a battle?

756
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:57,198
That's why you aren't doing that well.
-Is he angry because of the retreat?

757
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:02,036
No, he's happy that the Serbs are
advancing. Hurry up.

758
01:20:06,760 --> 01:20:09,274
What are you doing? Leave me alone!

759
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:13,394
Bajazit, where is the sultan?
Leave me!

760
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:18,159
Is the sultan alive? Bajazit,
what have you done to Murat?

761
01:20:18,440 --> 01:20:22,513
What should i do, master?
-They're already calling you master?

762
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:28,239
Traitors.
-Strangle him with a silky string.

763
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:34,039
You'll strangle your brother? Murat
said that a brother is sacred.

764
01:20:35,520 --> 01:20:40,594
He is. But I am a brother too.
Jakub's brother.

765
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:46,840
I am sacred too. -I'll never recognize
you as a master.

766
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:51,799
Do you have the string or not? -I do.
-What are you waiting for?

767
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:55,993
For me to order that they
use it to strangle you?

768
01:21:00,280 --> 01:21:04,796
Murderer! Bajazit! Brother!

769
01:21:15,840 --> 01:21:19,150
Prepare two stretchers for
Murat and Jakub.

770
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,709
We'll bury them in Bursa.

771
01:21:22,080 --> 01:21:25,470
Now we have to end this
battle as soon as possible.

772
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:30,994
Let the buzundzija's shout and wail.
What are we paying them for?

773
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:40,435
Everyone should set out to counterattack.
Let's tip

774
01:21:40,720 --> 01:21:43,917
the balance in our favor.

775
01:21:44,240 --> 01:21:47,118
What are you waiting for?
-I'll fly as an arrow.

776
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:50,671
Fly faster then lightning.
All forces ahead!

777
01:22:36,440 --> 01:22:40,718
Vlatko Vukovic is leaving the battle
and returning to Bosnia.

778
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:55,557
Pasha Sarudza
asks for enforcements.

779
01:22:55,840 --> 01:22:59,116
He's still stronger then the Serbs.
Let him continue the fight .

780
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:02,233
The army is assembling around
prince Lazar.

781
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:05,671
Our forces are swarming around him like bees
swarm around honey.

782
01:23:05,880 --> 01:23:09,589
Attack Lazar with all of your forces.

783
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,831
Serbs are amid chaos. Lazar
fell from a wounded horse,

784
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:24,716
the army thinks he's dead
and is running away.

785
01:23:56,280 --> 01:23:58,840
Don't give the Serbs any time to breathe.

786
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:04,031
Beware of Vuk Brankovic.
-He withdrew from Kosovo.

787
01:24:04,320 --> 01:24:07,118
Withdrew? -Withdrew.

788
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:04,436
News for Padishah.
-Let me here them.

789
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:10,033
The janissaries have captured
a Serbian prince. -What are you saying?

790
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:12,989
And a lot of magnates.

791
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:03,509
Last night in gold and silk,
today muddy and bloody.

792
01:26:04,880 --> 01:26:09,635
Last night on his throne,
today in the bear's hole .

793
01:26:09,960 --> 01:26:13,350
This is also coming from God.
-If you knew last night,

794
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:18,156
what you know today, you wouldn't be here.
-I didn't know last night,

795
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:22,353
that I'm buying myself eternity with this
suffering.

796
01:26:22,640 --> 01:26:27,714
Nonsense. Your head will
fall over here in the dust.

797
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:33,757
Your life isn't worth a nickel.

798
01:26:34,640 --> 01:26:37,916
Life values as much,
as you're willing to pay for it.

799
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:41,635
Never mind these cliches
and face the facts.

800
01:26:41,880 --> 01:26:46,715
Kosovo is full of facts without
heads, hands and legs.

801
01:26:47,320 --> 01:26:51,711
If I  compare our victory and your
defeat... -My defeat?

802
01:26:52,120 --> 01:26:56,272
Your defeat is in the fact that you don't
see our victory. -Victory?

803
01:26:57,640 --> 01:27:02,077
Is this victory? You have lost too much
blood and you haven't come to yourself.

804
01:27:02,320 --> 01:27:06,836
Look around you.
Is this your victory, Lazar?

805
01:27:07,240 --> 01:27:10,755
Are the corpses in Lab and Sitnica
the corpses of victors?

806
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,709
Do these broken hands and legs belong to
victors?

807
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:20,029
Is this head on the spear,
that is looking at its corpse on the ground,

808
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:22,754
a head of a victor?

809
01:27:24,680 --> 01:27:26,989
Yes, Bajazit.

810
01:27:30,520 --> 01:27:33,592
Take a look at it well so you 
remember it.

811
01:27:33,840 --> 01:27:38,550
You don't see a head like this every day.
-If life is really as precious 

812
01:27:38,760 --> 01:27:43,038
as you say why didn't Brakovic pay for
it as much?

813
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:47,717
Vuk's life is not worth it, Obilic's is.
Come closer, Bajazit.

814
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,430
Look, how beautiful this head is

815
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:54,911
with which the heavenly kingdom is being bought.

816
01:27:55,240 --> 01:27:59,358
You wouldn't get an onion for this head.

817
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:03,753
This head doesn't lay into a grave but
into a foundation.

818
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:11,192
This head talks too much.
Chop it off.

819
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:20,836
Allow me, noble sultan.
-Who are you? -Servant Milutin.

820
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:25,398
Don't ask for his life.
-Allow me, noble sultan,

821
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:29,991
to take into this sinful hands Lazar's 
sacred head.

822
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:35,677
Accept it. I don't think he will
feel any more easy about it.

823
01:28:43,360 --> 01:28:46,272
Tell me now Lazar,
who is the victor.

824
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:50,189
You with the head on the scaffold
or me with the crown on my head?

825
01:28:50,440 --> 01:28:55,070
Your scaffold is only a threshold to me.
As far as the victory is concerned,

826
01:28:55,320 --> 01:28:58,437
we have fought in different 
battles.

827
01:28:58,680 --> 01:29:02,070
You have won in yours,
I have won in mine.

828
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:06,315
Thank you, Lord
for allowing me,

829
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:11,276
to be warmed by the evening of a sunny day
on this threshold.

830
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:27,715
Another victorious head.
Last night on throne,

831
01:29:28,040 --> 01:29:32,033
today on the scaffold.
-And in the evening on the cloud.

832
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:36,149
A cap is more worth now then a head.

833
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:41,594
Even if it's not worth a grain of bean
I'll give you a pearl grain for it.

834
01:29:42,160 --> 01:29:46,472
Stretch out your hand. -My hand was
sanctified by this head.

835
01:29:48,720 --> 01:29:54,158
Chop off his sanctified hand,
so it doesn't get greased tomorrow.

836
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:15,478
What about the other Serbian aristocrats?
-Kill them. -All of them? -All.

837
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,714
It seems that the battle is over.

838
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:57,710
The stretchers with Murat  and Jakub
shall be carried with the greatest honour.

839
01:30:58,200 --> 01:31:04,150
Let's hurry to Bursa. -The troops are
restless because of Jakub.

840
01:31:04,520 --> 01:31:10,470
We have to deal with it immediately.
-How? -You know, how.

841
01:31:10,760 --> 01:31:14,992
There are only two ways,
advancement and execution.

842
01:31:15,200 --> 01:31:19,034
Hurry up.
Strangle Kapidza Pasha at once.

843
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:23,678
Those that support me shall advance.

844
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:30,195
Clear up this heads and corpses
it's hot.

845
01:33:13,880 --> 01:33:19,079
Everything splendid and faithful died on Kosovo Polje.

846
01:33:21,560 --> 01:33:24,870
Only the unfaithful survived Kosovo.

847
01:33:25,440 --> 01:33:29,479
Only the unfaithful returned home from Kosovo.

848
01:33:29,760 --> 01:33:34,117
Us unmarried widows are looking at them from
the thresholds.

849
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:42,594
Whom shall we marry, whose children
should we widows give birth to ?

850
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:48,710
Should we continue the treacherous
origin?

851
01:33:56,320 --> 01:34:01,678
Or will each of us go after our dead hero
to no-time,

852
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:09,399
from no-place. A fiancee for a live hero, a
bride for a dead one.

853
01:34:47,160 --> 01:34:51,278
What are you carrying in your bag?
-Just oats.

854
01:34:51,640 --> 01:34:56,714
Something is glistening. -What is it?
Unless they stole the oats and put

855
01:34:57,080 --> 01:35:01,710
a candle into my bag.
-Your bag?

856
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:24,229
Your hay is burning. -Burning?
Probably some firefly.

857
01:35:26,320 --> 01:35:30,154
Let me help you. -I didn't
stop to rest,

858
01:35:30,400 --> 01:35:32,914
but to listen. Do you hear me?

859
01:35:34,640 --> 01:35:39,555
What is this? -Birds barking
From Kosovo, from human flesh

860
01:35:39,760 --> 01:35:43,799
the bark of crows and ravens is 
rising.

861
01:36:07,600 --> 01:36:11,479
They say they're on the threshold of
Pristina. -Move out of the way.

862
01:36:11,760 --> 01:36:15,275
Who are you saying this to?
Him, the martyr and hero?

863
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:18,557
Shall he move away from the prince
with whom he fought along,

864
01:36:18,760 --> 01:36:21,354
from the saint that also,
sanctified him?

865
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,797
Respect his wooden leg, you wooden head.
 -Listen, you...

866
01:36:25,040 --> 01:36:28,350
I have listened enough.
-Shut up. The princess is coming.

867
01:36:34,600 --> 01:36:38,559
Look the princess Milica is coming,
our woman martyr

868
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:43,755
Take off your cap. She has come
to expect her martyr.

869
01:36:46,720 --> 01:36:50,872
I am the only salvation for
Serbia that also suits you.

870
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:53,675
Me? -You.

871
01:36:54,360 --> 01:36:57,557
Lazarj's crown will be succeeded 
after me by my sons,

872
01:36:57,880 --> 01:37:02,271
your grandsons
Grgur, Djuradj, Lazar.

873
01:37:02,600 --> 01:37:06,513
Lazar didn't die in Kosovo so
we quarrel because of the crown


874
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:11,396
but to unite around his head.

875
01:37:12,720 --> 01:37:17,669
Whatever, Mrs Milica,
Lazar is dead, Vuk is alive.

876
01:37:18,680 --> 01:37:21,433
Both is good for Serbia.

877
01:37:22,560 --> 01:37:26,075
For which Serbia,
Vuk Brankovic?

878
01:37:26,360 --> 01:37:29,557
For the Serbia that doesn't defend itself
when being chopped? Which has it's eyes closed

879
01:37:29,800 --> 01:37:33,759
and is silent when it's being burned down
and when others administer it in their own way?

880
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:37,871
When others command her what to
sow and reap.

881
01:37:38,120 --> 01:37:41,874
What and from whom it shall buy and whom it shall
sell. For the Serbia,

882
01:37:42,120 --> 01:37:46,636
which forgets about it's own children,
heroes and martyrs,

883
01:37:47,000 --> 01:37:52,028
dresses, feeds and glorifies those that dream
of burying it.

884
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:57,758
Many times wa have been led by those that we have fed and
watered 

885
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:02,598
and been fooled by them.

886
01:38:03,560 --> 01:38:06,916
Which Serbia will you choose?

887
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:43,716
The Turks have finally destroyed the Serbian empire
in Kosovo.

888
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:47,476
Serbia wasn't defeated by the Turks
in Kosovo

889
01:38:47,760 --> 01:38:53,232
but by its own magnates.
-If Serbia wants to save itself,

890
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:59,118
it must forget about Kosovo as soon as possible.
-What should it remember?

891
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:03,549
Kosovo opens for Serbia the
doors of hell.

892
01:39:04,320 --> 01:39:07,710
Kosovo lifts Serbia to heaven.

893
01:39:56,320 --> 01:39:58,709
Lazar is coming.

894
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:06,791
Until we transfer him to Ravanica,
he will be here in Pristina.

895
01:40:09,040 --> 01:40:13,352
The assembly that has enthroned Lazar,
will with God's blessing 

896
01:40:13,640 --> 01:40:18,475
enthrone Lazar's son upon him.

897
01:40:21,600 --> 01:40:25,798
If you will enthrone this child and
not me,

898
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:30,790
you will not only be in war with the Turks but 
also with me.

899
01:40:49,960 --> 01:40:54,033
Where are you now, Lazar? Where have you gone?
-He has carried our burden with him to the sky.

900
01:40:54,320 --> 01:40:57,915
Where have you gone?
Whom did you leave us to?

901
01:40:58,800 --> 01:41:03,351
In which holy land should we bury you, Lazar's head?

902
01:41:05,680 --> 01:41:08,877
We will not bury Lazar's head.

903
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:13,631
We will lay it in the ground like seed.

904
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:24,832
How should I weep for you,
how should I not mourn for you,

905
01:41:26,600 --> 01:41:30,639
when everything in this world
has ended for me?

906
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:37,439
How should I not rejoice,
when you have returned glittering.

907
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:43,956
You left as a great hero
and returned as a great martyr.

908
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:47,837
You're returning bigger as you were when you left.

909
01:41:49,680 --> 01:41:51,989
How could we not glorify you today,

910
01:41:52,440 --> 01:41:56,115
when you are rising to the clouds with the rain
of our tears,

911
01:41:56,680 --> 01:42:02,118
to accept the upper crown,
and leave us in this blind world,

912
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:04,999
where Stefan will be out eyes?

913
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,630
Help us, oh Lord, that the ruined to
to ashes from ashes it rises,

914
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:21,993
that the disunited unites,
that the blind sees,

915
01:42:22,440 --> 01:42:29,391
that the killed, tortured, burned down,
slaughtered, downtrodden, hung

916
01:42:29,800 --> 01:42:34,112
and torn apart, in known and unknown
graves buried,

917
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:41,551
from all the graves risen, entire Serbia
comes under one crown.

918
01:42:54,360 --> 01:43:00,595
You have lost your bodily eyes,
but you have not seen with the clerical ones.

919
01:43:03,000 --> 01:43:08,836
Are you listening to me? -I think I am
slowly starting to see.

920
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:16,076
A blind can be deceived by a lot of things.
Something is warming you and you're hoping,

921
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,914
it's shining.

922
01:43:19,400 --> 01:43:24,758
I think I see.
-What do you see?

923
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:31,271
A man that is leaving for a path.
-Which path?

924
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:38,876
I can see that he has trespassed a border .
I don't see him anymore.

925
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:45,191
Look more carefully beyond this
border.

926
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:52,278
I only see a spider crawling along the
path.

927
01:43:53,520 --> 01:44:01,837
Look closer at this spider.
-Are you going to say it's a human?

928
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:08,910
Do you know
which human this spider is?

929
01:44:09,200 --> 01:44:13,591
We have to try to
look over the upper border

930
01:44:14,200 --> 01:44:18,955
which is glaringly evading us.
Which we were shown by,

931
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:23,748
towards which he led us
and across which

932
01:44:24,200 --> 01:44:30,036
he left for the golden worlds
Lazar.

933
