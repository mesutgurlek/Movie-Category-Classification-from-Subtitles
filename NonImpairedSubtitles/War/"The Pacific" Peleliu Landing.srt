1
00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:06,706
<i>Hanks: March, 1944...</i>

2
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:09,575
<i>After four months of fierce
jungle combat,</i>

3
00:00:09,609 --> 00:00:11,015
<i>The marines of the 1st division</i>

4
00:00:11,049 --> 00:00:13,518
<i>Were withdrawn from
cape gloucester.</i>

5
00:00:15,956 --> 00:00:18,324
<i>Veteran #1: We were absolutely certain
we were going to go back</i>

6
00:00:18,358 --> 00:00:21,460
<i>To Melbourne to rest again.</i>

7
00:00:21,495 --> 00:00:25,330
But no, we ended up on
an island called pavuvu.

8
00:00:26,832 --> 00:00:30,234
<i>Hanks: Pavuvu, part of the
Solomon island chain,</i>

9
00:00:30,268 --> 00:00:32,435
<i>Is just north of guadalcanal.</i>

10
00:00:34,638 --> 00:00:37,206
<i>Once a thriving coconut
plantation,</i>

11
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,508
<i>It was abandoned when the
war broke out.</i>

12
00:00:41,478 --> 00:00:44,680
The guy that picked that out,
he sure didn't know what he was doing.

13
00:00:44,714 --> 00:00:48,219
It was the nastiest,
dirtiest looking place under the sun.

14
00:00:48,253 --> 00:00:51,623
All kinds of things
just grew in profusion,

15
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:54,227
Especially the rat population.

16
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:56,531
The land crabs would
come out at night

17
00:00:56,565 --> 00:01:00,034
And you could hear them
clackity-clacking and clicking around.

18
00:01:00,068 --> 00:01:02,104
And they would get
into your shoes.

19
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,375
<i>Veteran #5: A lot of
training started.</i>

20
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:08,777
<i>And it seemed to get
heavier and heavier,</i>

21
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:11,913
<i>So you knew we were gonna go
somewhere into combat.</i>

22
00:01:13,715 --> 00:01:15,883
<i>Hanks: In late August, 1944,</i>

23
00:01:15,918 --> 00:01:18,285
<i>The 1st division shipped
out again</i>

24
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:22,357
<i>Headed for a small coral island beten
Guam and the Philippines...</i>

25
00:01:22,392 --> 00:01:24,760
<i>Peleliu.</i>

26
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:27,730
<i>Only six miles long and
two miles wide,</i>

27
00:01:27,764 --> 00:01:29,632
<i>Peleliu held an airstrip</i>

28
00:01:29,666 --> 00:01:31,902
<i>That was close to the
philippine islands.</i>

29
00:01:31,936 --> 00:01:34,638
<i>General Douglas macarthur decided</i>

30
00:01:34,672 --> 00:01:36,239
<i>That the capture of that airstrip</i>

31
00:01:36,274 --> 00:01:38,909
<i>Was critical to retaking
the Philippines</i>

32
00:01:38,943 --> 00:01:41,079
<i>As a stepping stone
to the invasion</i>

33
00:01:41,113 --> 00:01:43,115
<i>Of the Japanese mainland.</i>

34
00:01:43,149 --> 00:01:45,384
( explosions )

35
00:01:45,418 --> 00:01:49,222
<i>The Navy bombarded peleliu
for three days</i>

36
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:52,125
<i>And the marines followed.</i>

37
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,470
<i>The men were told that the fighting
would last only a few days.</i>

38
00:02:01,504 --> 00:02:03,873
<i>But the combat on peleliu</i>

39
00:02:03,907 --> 00:02:06,676
<i>Would last more than two months</i>

40
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,679
<i>And would become as deadly</i>

41
00:02:08,713 --> 00:02:12,216
<i>As any island invasion
of world war ii.</i>

42
00:02:14,053 --> 00:02:17,054
<i>Veteran #4: I don't think you could
train for anything like that.</i>

43
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:20,291
<i>It started when we started in.</i>

44
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:24,629
And it didn't cease.

45
00:02:24,663 --> 00:02:28,599
It was... it was a nightmare.

46
00:02:38,978 --> 00:02:43,048
<i>Puller: For you are about to be
awarded the medal of honor.</i>

47
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:47,453
Selling U.S. War bonds
is just as important

48
00:02:47,487 --> 00:02:51,758
As what you did on guadalcanal.
Now pack your seabag. You're going home.

49
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:53,126
Home?

50
00:02:53,161 --> 00:02:55,028
I'm enlisting tomorrow.

51
00:02:55,063 --> 00:02:57,698
I'd do it tonight
if they were open.

52
00:02:57,733 --> 00:03:00,635
Eugene... - I don't need
your permission, father.

53
00:03:00,669 --> 00:03:03,972
<i>"dear vera, we haven't seen a

54

<i>They got smart and got the hell out
of this godforsaken spot.</i>

55
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:09,879
<i>Now our enemy is the
jungle itself.</i>

56
00:03:09,913 --> 00:03:12,849
<i>The jungle and the rain."</i>

57
00:03:14,786 --> 00:03:15,886
<i>Lebec!</i>

58
00:03:18,723 --> 00:03:21,826
All you need is a week or two.
That should do the trick.

59
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:23,695
<i>They got a hospital
over on banika.</i>

60
00:03:23,729 --> 00:03:27,065
<i>I'm gonna pull some paper and you'll
be on your way in an hour.</i>

61
00:03:27,099 --> 00:03:30,068
Why am I in with guys who need to
have their razor blades taken away?

62
00:03:30,103 --> 00:03:32,438
Most of the guys that come
through here are simply...

63
00:03:32,472 --> 00:03:33,806
Tired.

64
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,108
My guess is you fall
into that category.

65
00:03:36,143 --> 00:03:38,110
Hey, you're a dead man,
you know it!

66
00:03:38,145 --> 00:03:41,481
- ( grunts )
- go get Dr. Grant!

67
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:44,416
This isn't the right place for me.
I'm rested, I'm fit.

68
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:47,519
I want to return to my
unit and my friends.

69
00:03:47,554 --> 00:03:50,189
I hope it's quick and
easy for you, leckie.

70
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:52,324
No worries about
ending up like me.

You, mom, pa, and most of new
Jersey at John Basilone day.

That was crazy.

- He looks familiar.

What you got?

220
00:15:24,953 --> 00:15:27,388
Pens. Tell Santa whether
you been naughty or nice.

221
00:15:27,423 --> 00:15:29,290
Naughty. The naughtiest.

222

- It's June.
- It's the South pacific.

223

Christmas comes in June.

<i>Something for runner's stocking.</i>

Oh, I read this already.

00:16:08,264 --> 00:16:10,799
I don't believe it.

234

Oh!

235
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:20,076
Something's wrong.

236
00:16:20,111 --> 00:16:22,679
Something's very wrong if you
made it through boot camp.

237
00:16:22,713 --> 00:16:24,314
Give me a break, you old greaser!

238

- Sir.

240
00:16:29,187 --> 00:16:32,455
What's this about, marine?
Some rite of greeting new to the corps?

241
00:16:32,489 --> 00:16:35,024
Yes, sir. Um, I mean, no, sir.

242
00:16:35,059 --> 00:16:38,127
- Who are you?
- Private Eugene sledge, sir.

243

<i>You fellas know each other or is this
some kind of conflict resolution?</i>

Mobile, Alabama, sir.

245
00:16:43,901 --> 00:16:46,269
- Mobile?
- Yes, sir.

246
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:49,973
- Old friends, huh?
- That explains it.

247
00:16:50,008 --> 00:16:51,709
As you were.

248
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:54,545
But try not to dislocate a
shoulder or break an arm.

249
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,014
We need both you men healthy.

250
00:16:56,048 --> 00:16:57,215
- Sir.
- Sir.

251
00:16:57,249 --> 00:16:58,816
Carry on.

252
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:10,929
Get me in hot water

253
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:13,365
Yeah, well, you deserve it!

254
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:17,436

258
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:25,378
You should have seen it
when we first got here.

259
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:28,949
It was wall-to-wall rats,
crabs and rotten coconuts.

260
00:17:28,983 --> 00:17:31,585
Thank God I'm rotating home.

261
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:34,455
I can't believe I finally
get here and you go home.

When you leavin'?

263
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:38,226
When the marine corps tells me.

270
00:17:56,009 --> 00:18:00,245
As the health of the
individual marine.

271
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:05,151
Marines will make every effort
to keep themselves clean.

272
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,020
- Hey!
- Ahh!

273
00:18:07,054 --> 00:18:09,322
Hey, don't you quit on me, fucker!

274
00:18:09,357 --> 00:18:11,658

<i>Phillips: They get hot chow

You know, it might
only be crud like this,

277
00:18:16,566 --> 00:18:19,168
But when you been on
the line taking fire,

278
00:18:19,202 --> 00:18:21,470
Hot chow is a miracle.

You know, you laugh... you laugh,

282
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:33,616
But that might be worth its
weight in gold someday.

283
00:18:33,650 --> 00:18:36,485
You get hungry enough,
somebody'll want to trade for it.

284

You do not trade this... Ever.

285

( cocking )

286
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:46,496
.45 will stop a jap better
than a clip of your carbine.

287
00:18:46,530 --> 00:18:49,132
You hit one of the suckers
in the hand with that,

288
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,268
Heh, take his arm right off.

289
00:18:51,302 --> 00:18:54,138
You can write your father a
nice thank-you note for that.

290
00:18:54,172 --> 00:18:57,775
Working party... three of
you boots go with snafu.

291
00:18:57,809 --> 00:18:58,943
Hurry up!

292
00:18:58,978 --> 00:19:02,514
You heard the sergeant... Now!

You don't mind, do you, leyden?

294
00:19:05,118 --> 00:19:08,754
You assholes are gonna miss cleaning
out oil barrels pretty soon.

295
00:19:10,189 --> 00:19:12,925
You're gonna be humping
up some fucking hill...

296
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:17,363
Or across a beach,

297
00:19:17,398 --> 00:19:19,799
Japs pouring shit for fire,

298
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,835
Pissing your pants,
crying "boo hoo,"

299
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:25,638
And wishing you were back
here with nothing asked of you

300
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:27,573
But to scrub oil out of drums.

301
00:19:27,607 --> 00:19:29,974
( panting )

302
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:32,343
Why don't you grab a brush

303
00:19:32,378 --> 00:19:33,744
And give us a hand?

304
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:36,714
Fuck that shit.
I scrub drums for no man.

305
00:19:36,748 --> 00:19:38,649
Can we take a break?

306
00:19:38,684 --> 00:19:41,552
Do whatever you want.
This ain't my detail.

307
00:19:41,587 --> 00:19:46,057
I was supposed to dump you all off here,
then report back to the c.P.

308
00:19:46,092 --> 00:19:48,093
Then why are you still here?

309
00:19:48,127 --> 00:19:52,230
I like to watch the
new guys sweat.

310
00:20:09,749 --> 00:20:12,684
Ahh! Are those the
most butt-ugly creatures

311
00:20:12,719 --> 00:20:15,787
You ever saw before in your life?

312
00:20:20,927 --> 00:20:22,661
( strikes lighter )

313
00:20:22,695 --> 00:20:24,863
Jesus, sid.

314
00:20:26,967 --> 00:20:29,869
When you start pulling them out
of your hooch in the morning,

315
00:20:29,903 --> 00:20:32,606
You won't feel so tenderhearted.

316
00:20:55,528 --> 00:20:58,530
Lost mine in the polk.

317
00:20:58,564 --> 00:21:01,866
Or somebody took it. Maybe one of
the swabbies wanted a souvenir.

318
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:03,301
Yeah?

319
00:21:03,336 --> 00:21:06,371
Some of the guys think
they're good luck.

320
00:21:06,405 --> 00:21:09,574
I don't know.
You can have this one.

321
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:12,210
I got a couple.

322
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,646
Here.

323
00:21:15,681 --> 00:21:18,049
- Thank you.
- Sure.

324
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:25,657

325
00:21:25,691 --> 00:21:28,026
Sid?

326
00:21:29,729 --> 00:21:31,497
What's it like?

327
00:21:39,107 --> 00:21:41,508
I slept with a woman in Melbourne.

328
00:21:41,543 --> 00:21:43,344
I'm not bragging.

329
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:48,783
But that's at one end, right?

330
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:53,055
And then way down there
as far as you can go...

331
00:21:55,158 --> 00:21:58,995
And that's what it's like.

332
00:21:59,029 --> 00:22:01,597
And that...

333
00:22:01,631 --> 00:22:04,166
That you could never imagine.

334
00:22:09,771 --> 00:22:11,539
Okay.

335
00:22:16,444 --> 00:22:19,045
I'm gonna miss you, sid.

336
00:22:27,087 --> 00:22:29,221
You'll be all right.

Fuck her.

346
00:23:30,118 --> 00:23:32,419

I believe the angels

You might catch them

Most of these jokers can't read.

<i>Have you heard the latest

369
00:25:48,460 --> 00:25:49,827
There's another war?

370
00:25:49,862 --> 00:25:53,164
We invaded Europe.
Landed last month in France.

371
00:25:53,198 --> 00:25:56,233
Hell, unless you got a brother over there,
most guys don't give a shit.

372
00:25:56,268 --> 00:25:58,769
My brother landed in Italy,

<i>Tank battalion.</i>

That explains it.
You're a believer.

379
00:26:29,669 --> 00:26:31,937
Yes.

380
00:26:34,073 --> 00:26:36,175
Okay, question:

381
00:26:36,209 --> 00:26:37,943
God created everything, right?

382
00:26:37,977 --> 00:26:42,013
The heavens, the seven seas,
the marine corps...

383
00:26:42,047 --> 00:26:43,847
<i>Sleeping beauty there...</i>

384
00:26:43,882 --> 00:26:45,415
Even him.

385
00:26:45,449 --> 00:26:48,216
...Land crabs, rats, mosquitoes.

386
00:26:48,251 --> 00:26:50,318
The mosquitoes are a little tough
to understand, I guess, but...

387
00:26:50,352 --> 00:26:53,287
God created japs too, right...

388
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:57,256
Yellow slants who have tried
to kill me on many occasions?

389
00:26:57,290 --> 00:26:59,791
Japs come from the
garden of eden too?

390
00:27:01,894 --> 00:27:03,862
Well, what we do is up to us.

391
00:27:03,896 --> 00:27:06,865
<i>He gives the choice.</i>

392
00:27:06,899 --> 00:27:10,101
Free will. Right.

393
00:27:10,135 --> 00:27:14,238
Except he's God, of course, so he knows
what we're gonna do before we do it.

394
00:27:14,272 --> 00:27:16,674
Predestination.

395
00:27:19,277 --> 00:27:22,078
So the whole game is fixed by
the will of gramps on his throne

396
00:27:22,113 --> 00:27:23,880
While we're down here for what?

397
00:27:23,914 --> 00:27:27,316
His entertainment? That makes
us chumps and God's a sadist.

398
00:27:27,351 --> 00:27:31,553
And either way I
got no use for him.

399
00:27:31,588 --> 00:27:33,722
So what do you believe in?

400
00:27:33,757 --> 00:27:35,691
I believe in ammunition.

401
00:27:35,725 --> 00:27:38,860
<i>Tell you what, though.</i>

402
00:27:38,895 --> 00:27:41,529
Since I'm not on speaking
terms with him anymore,

403
00:27:41,563 --> 00:27:44,132
Next time you're having a
chat with the old geezer,

404
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,534
Can you ask him to sink
a few jap transports

405
00:27:46,569 --> 00:27:48,502
And have them all
fall on their bayonets

406
00:27:48,537 --> 00:27:51,938
So I can get the fuck
out of here and go home?

407
00:27:51,973 --> 00:27:55,140
I sure would appreciate it.

408
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:02,480
You go ahead and keep it.

409
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:05,515
I don't know why I have
it in the first place.

410
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:07,117
No, thanks.

411
00:28:09,921 --> 00:28:12,789
