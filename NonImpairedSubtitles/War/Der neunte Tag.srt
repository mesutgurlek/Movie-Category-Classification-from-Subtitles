Here, take it!

10
00:02:16,813 --> 00:02:23,774
We were lying at Madagascar,
got infected with the plague

11
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:25,893
At there, we pray with Latin

12
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:32,014
Everything is soaked by the water,
everyday there is one man passed away

13
00:02:32,175 --> 00:02:36,095
Hey! Hi! My Friends...

14
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:39,696
The priest pray with Latin

15
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:55,616
When captain yelled, yes,
the sailors quiet down immediately

16
00:02:56,257 --> 00:03:00,298
Because everyone missed
their hometown

17
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:03,379
The hometown they dream
to see once again.

18
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:06,860
Attention! Bertram is here

19
00:03:16,621 --> 00:03:19,060
Keep singing

20
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:27,662
We were lying at Madagascar,
got infected with the plague

21
00:03:27,781 --> 00:03:36,583
Everything is soaked by the water,
everyday there is one man passed away

22
00:03:36,822 --> 00:03:41,024
My Friends...

23
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:49,704
Please take care, young lady

24
00:03:49,865 --> 00:03:54,025
Take care, take care!

25
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:58,027
When captain yelled, yes,
the sailors quiet down immediately

26
00:03:58,146 --> 00:04:02,387
Come on!
Come here, you poland priest pig

27
00:04:03,226 --> 00:04:07,267
Can't you be more elegant
when singing Deutsch songs?

28
00:04:07,386 --> 00:04:11,747
Looks like I have to teach you the
tempo sense, start from beginning...

29
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:22,108
We were lying at Madagascar,
got infected with the plague

30
00:04:22,229 --> 00:04:30,710
Everything is soaked by the water,
everyday there is one man passed away

31
00:04:32,551 --> 00:04:35,911
It's you again, you arrogant man!

32
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:42,071
The priest with egg-frying pan

33
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:47,233
I ordered, sing!

34
00:04:47,352 --> 00:04:49,713
Sing quickly!

35
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:11,236
Go, hurry! Move on!

36
00:05:16,636 --> 00:05:19,877
Stupid, listen to the order!

37
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,679
God write down secrets with symbols

38
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,920
We expose it to the world

39
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,881
The sacrifice of Jesus
is because our sin

40
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:55,882
He devoted everything by his death

41
00:05:56,161 --> 00:05:59,122
The blood of Jesus...

42
00:06:16,045 --> 00:06:21,005
Do you really believe the God exists?
Where is he?

43
00:06:23,805 --> 00:06:27,045
You see it around here?

44
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:31,647
Pull him up!

45
00:06:46,529 --> 00:06:50,730
In the Jesus blood, we found...

46
00:06:51,049 --> 00:06:55,850
the best way to escape
from depression

47
00:06:56,130 --> 00:07:00,931
The goddes Maria breeds us

48
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,012
Jesus lets human with equal status

49
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:10,252
He came to search, what we lost...

50
00:07:12,851 --> 00:07:16,813
Who kept singing,
who's the next to be hanged!

51
00:07:16,972 --> 00:07:19,612
...Jesus
Promised with swear:

52
00:07:20,492 --> 00:07:23,973
no matter when I'll always be with you

53
00:07:36,855 --> 00:07:39,816
Is this your mother?

54
00:07:43,336 --> 00:07:47,697
You're so lucky,

55
00:08:08,579 --> 00:08:11,819

71
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:35,558
You're freed.

72
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,521
Have a nice trip!

73
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:06,923
Pig priest.

84
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:28,390
Henry!

85
00:14:31,190 --> 00:14:33,350
Henry...

86
00:14:39,231 --> 00:14:41,392
Oh my god!

87
00:14:45,392 --> 00:14:48,632
How do you find us?

88
00:15:00,594 --> 00:15:03,955
We're knocked out of our own home

89
00:15:04,835 --> 00:15:07,795

Hurry, sit down!

94
00:15:38,359 --> 00:15:41,320
Where is your mother?

95
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,000
No one told you?

96
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:51,361
Our mother has passed away

97
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:45,008
These shoes are too small

98
00:16:46,008 --> 00:16:49,249
but how about this?

99
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:29,494
Credentials!
I'm here for Mr. Gebhardt

100
00:17:32,975 --> 00:17:36,215
Upstair, turn left

101
00:17:48,137 --> 00:17:52,257
Luxembourg Civil Law administration
Charging Leader Gebhardt office

102
00:17:52,376 --> 00:17:56,698
I'm very sorry, he is in the interrogation
hello, Mr. Kremer

103
00:17:56,817 --> 00:17:59,777
Priest!

104
00:18:02,659 --> 00:18:05,898
Priest Kremer
Ok, please come in!

105
00:18:07,699 --> 00:18:10,580
Hellow, Mr. Kremer

106
00:18:10,699 --> 00:18:14,060
So, you don't want to
take off your overcoat?

107
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,141
Good morning.

108
00:18:28,222 --> 00:18:32,182
Have you took enough rest
before coming back?

109
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:38,343
I'm truely sorry about
your mother passed away

110
00:18:38,464 --> 00:18:44,024
She has been here a lot before
and she speaks a lot for you...

111
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:49,265
Yes, Please put the call through
to prison camp commander Mr. Dachau

112
00:18:49,665 --> 00:18:53,905
Dear Mother, I'm here,
and getting used here

113
00:18:54,026 --> 00:18:58,026
To this naughty camp life
I can only answer: Yes

114
00:18:58,145 --> 00:19:02,266
and will soon be a pig of the prison camp,
can't look back, can't have sympathy to others

115
00:19:02,386 --> 00:19:05,387
can only dump into it,
living under darkness silently

116
00:19:05,508 --> 00:19:09,868
This is the last letter for you in the
prison camp - what do you mean?

117
00:19:10,068 --> 00:19:13,588
Why men become the pig
of this prison camp?

118
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:20,628
Long live, Hitler...
Yes, thank you.

119
00:19:20,789 --> 00:19:24,150
This thing is about
the prison 25639.

120
00:19:24,309 --> 00:19:28,390
No, he has arrived but very sad,
there is a big mistake

121
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:32,590
Mr. Kremer is not freed,
he just got the vacation

122
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:35,791
yes, 9 days precisely

123
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:40,071
and only one rule:
if Mr. Kremer tries to escape

124
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:45,152
all the prisoned priest in Luxembourg
will be executed death without exception

125
00:19:45,272 --> 00:19:48,232
Long live! Hitler!

126
00:19:49,192 --> 00:19:53,433
Very sorry, this is
the order from the boss

127
00:19:53,874 --> 00:19:59,194
besides, I do not totally agree
to their decision

128
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:03,675
I think you should be thankful that
I give you this vacation.
I think, I should give you this chance

129
00:20:03,794 --> 00:20:08,155
for you to say goodbye
with your monther

130
00:20:08,915 --> 00:20:11,076
please sit

131
00:20:22,197 --> 00:20:27,277
Because your action opposed German
you're arrested at the French boundary

132
00:20:27,397 --> 00:20:31,478
Please smoke! You had been
working for French government

133
00:20:31,599 --> 00:20:35,719
joined the "French Luxembourg Mission"
which is against the third Empire...

134
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:40,799
and try to destory the German construction
in Luxembourg isn't it?

135
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:51,041
Mr. Kremer

136
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:55,281
You're a very good speaker

137
00:20:55,402 --> 00:20:59,322
this is seen from your
anti-racism speech

138
00:20:59,442 --> 00:21:03,483
Of course you have your reason!
Jesus is also Jewish

139
00:21:03,602 --> 00:21:08,924
But the Jewish keep
depressing themselves

140
00:21:09,043 --> 00:21:13,084
If allowable, I'll start from the story
long time ago, for all these we have
to thank for the Jesus Christ

141
00:21:13,203 --> 00:21:17,525
Because of him,
we know what we have to be aware of

142
00:21:17,645 --> 00:21:22,005
To us,
we have to be aware of Jewish

143
00:21:22,966 --> 00:21:29,006
Even if only myself to defend the Jewish,
I will fight for the Jesus's bible

144
00:21:31,846 --> 00:21:35,207
Don't you want one?
Oh, yes

145
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:48,768
Here, have a chocolate,
this you can't resist!

146
00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:02,691
You skiped!
Absolutely not! You did!

147
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:11,652
You're too slow...

148
00:22:13,012 --> 00:22:16,252
but now I jumped over!

149
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,300
What? is he on time?

150
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:18,501
On time for a few minutes
People can speak to the priest of what they want

151
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:22,701
because they have principals,
you should not under estimate him

152
00:23:22,821 --> 00:23:26,902
He is relied by the Vatican,
there must be some reason. - Yes

153
00:23:27,022 --> 00:23:31,102
He is the Cardinal's famous person,
his family is also very well known

154
00:23:31,222 --> 00:23:35,343
The whole Vatican is a big house, and
Luxembourg is just a brick of a damaged house

155
00:23:35,463 --> 00:23:40,343
if we take off the brick,
the walls will fall

156
00:23:40,463 --> 00:23:44,503
But what if Kremer escape?
- He won't!

157
00:23:44,624 --> 00:23:48,706
He is very clear, what would
this bring to his brothers

158
00:23:48,825 --> 00:23:52,905
but will he cooperate with us? - Province
Political Party Leader, there is rumor saying...

159
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:57,107
the Pope will be soon deciding
the action to the Jewish problem

160
00:23:57,226 --> 00:24:01,307
We should be prepared. The Pope will still come
to congratulate our Leader's birthday every year

161
00:24:01,426 --> 00:24:05,508
and call him the
"Most respectable Mr. Hitler"

162
00:24:05,627 --> 00:24:09,708
Right now he criticize the allize force
to the German's attack

163
00:24:09,827 --> 00:24:14,789
I have no complain to the Vatican,
the Holy See at least for now...

164
00:24:16,909 --> 00:24:21,148
I hope to get the report
everyday goodbye!

165
00:24:21,990 --> 00:24:26,110
Mr. Charging Leader
You're a powerful person

166
00:24:26,231 --> 00:24:30,391
but if your plan failed, even if you
have good relationships with
the top couldn't help you at all

167
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:34,511
We need a lot of talented people
for the East Prison camp

168
00:24:34,632 --> 00:24:38,992
Oh, I remembered.
You were there before.

169
00:25:24,517 --> 00:25:30,078
If this is a vacation, are you
going back to the Dachau's camp?

170
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:36,119
People have to stay
at their position...

171
00:25:36,238 --> 00:25:40,479
stay where he belongs to,
and believe in God.

172
00:25:47,561 --> 00:25:50,481
What's this mean?

173
00:25:50,601 --> 00:25:53,561
I can't...

174
00:25:55,482 --> 00:25:59,843
Nazi treats the priest better
than the others

175
00:26:00,802 --> 00:26:04,003
usually, 4 people have
only one bread

176
00:26:04,123 --> 00:26:07,483
but we can have one
for each 3 priests

177
00:26:08,843 --> 00:26:13,203
they hope, every other
people will hate us

178
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:30,727
are you going back?

179
00:26:35,847 --> 00:26:39,808
if you can't eat now,
then eat it later

180
00:26:49,489 --> 00:26:53,569
if he tried to escape,
we'll also be punished

181
00:26:53,688 --> 00:26:57,770
what the bullshit you're talking about!
His feet is soo big that no shoes can fit in

182
00:26:57,890 --> 00:27:02,251
where can he escape?

183
00:27:08,012 --> 00:27:12,052
All these things were from Raymond,
should fits you

184
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:16,413
I changed the waist
of trousers to be smaller

185
00:27:17,533 --> 00:27:21,894
This shoes is from Roger,
2 sizes bigger than yours

186
00:27:27,974 --> 00:27:32,335
Your book is in that basket,
we can hardly bring you anything

187
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:15,341
Henry Kremer...

188
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:18,701
Jesus Christ bless you

189
00:28:18,821 --> 00:28:21,740
Long live! Amen

190
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:26,101
Gerard Mersch. I'm the new manger
of the church adminstrator

191
00:28:31,263 --> 00:28:35,343
It has never been one priest has granded
for vacation from the camp. - Thanks

192
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:39,823
I'm very sorry,
are you sure you're not wrong?

193
00:28:41,104 --> 00:28:47,665
next week, I have to go back to Dachau's camp
we can let down the hope!

194
00:28:48,065 --> 00:28:53,025
I have to go to see the Gestapo,
I'll be back tomorrow. - Why?

195
00:28:53,946 --> 00:28:56,906
I don't know

196
00:28:57,505 --> 00:29:02,147
Vatican Pope decided to announce
another church policy

197
00:29:02,266 --> 00:29:06,388
we're contacting with Nazi,
this should have advantage

198
00:29:06,507 --> 00:29:10,548
If we do this then the church
will soon have Nazi flag on top

199
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:14,628
Please forgive me,
I have to prepare for a Mass

200
00:29:14,988 --> 00:29:18,348
What's our cardinal say about these?

201
00:29:21,909 --> 00:29:25,270
He does not step out
of his room anymore

202
00:29:25,710 --> 00:29:31,271
He does not want to have any
direct contact with any politics

203
00:29:32,351 --> 00:29:38,672
As the symbol of against and protest,
the church bell has ringed whole day

204
00:29:42,072 --> 00:29:46,152
Hitler accepted the requests
from the Pope

205
00:29:46,272 --> 00:29:49,513
The request to give the special
priority to the priest inside the camp

206
00:29:52,072 --> 00:29:56,433
This decision has sure reducing
the pressure for you right?

207
00:29:58,073 --> 00:30:03,274
that's right! You should thank
the Pope once again

208
00:30:03,395 --> 00:30:08,115
Before celebration today, I want to know
whom am I serving for?

209
00:30:08,236 --> 00:30:10,196
The Name, The Job?

210
00:30:10,316 --> 00:30:13,675
Jozef Weida
Bishop area, Czestochowa

211
00:30:16,716 --> 00:30:18,876
you?

212
00:30:19,837 --> 00:30:23,237
I'm the Cardinal Kozal
of Bruno Church

213
00:30:25,038 --> 00:30:27,358
Next?
Armando Bausch

214
00:30:27,478 --> 00:30:32,438
Priest coming from Luxembourg, editor
Ah, another form Luxembourg

215
00:30:32,598 --> 00:30:37,879
You have a lot of people coming from there
little country but have a lot of mouth

216
00:30:37,998 --> 00:30:40,320
Name?
Nansen clerical

217
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:43,800
Professor from Oslo University

218
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:51,561
Drink off! Drink all!

219
00:30:51,681 --> 00:30:54,921
Drink off! Drink all!

220
00:31:06,164 --> 00:31:10,523
You sure don't like our German's Mossel
grape wine! Get out! Go to the basement!

221
00:31:10,803 --> 00:31:13,763
So? Hurry up!

222
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:21,446
The saint god father
kept praying for his followers

223
00:31:21,565 --> 00:31:24,926
also pray for the priests
in the camp

224
00:31:26,286 --> 00:31:32,446
the Loving Goddess Maria will take care of him
- How many people he saved by this?

225
00:31:32,567 --> 00:31:35,648
but maybe after the Pope
changed his attitude...

226
00:31:35,767 --> 00:31:40,807
we'll have more people died in the prisoner camp
- Henry, no matter what you have experienced

227
00:31:40,927 --> 00:31:45,008
You should not give up
the faith to God

228
00:31:45,129 --> 00:31:49,169
Some people keep silence
is just for help...

229
00:31:49,289 --> 00:31:53,650
Help the followers won't make
the situation become worse

230
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:59,930
They give you a vacation
must be some reason!

231
00:32:00,049 --> 00:32:05,011
one important reason is Your family
have a very famous fame in Luxembourg

232
00:32:05,170 --> 00:32:10,132
Henry, maybe they'll do
some special use to you

233
00:32:12,691 --> 00:32:15,651
what do you mean?

234
00:32:21,574 --> 00:32:25,453
The church is facing
the tough challenge!

235
00:32:25,573 --> 00:32:29,734
our attitude will decide,
if there will be more people's death

236
00:32:29,855 --> 00:32:33,934
If we obey German within
our allowable conscience

237
00:32:34,054 --> 00:32:38,415
we'll get more than we resist them

238
00:32:38,696 --> 00:32:44,256
learn smarter, Henry. Listen carefully
to what Gebhardt spoke to you

239
00:32:57,737 --> 00:33:03,418
our world is a lot more complicated
than your small prisoner camp

240
00:33:03,538 --> 00:33:09,099
there, everything is exposed, have your
own rules everything follow the order

241
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:15,740
This vacation can help you to see
the whole thing by the extensive contacts

242
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:19,900
for an exmaple you familiar,
we're doing a saint and a meanful battle

243
00:33:20,021 --> 00:33:24,061
I think personally

244
00:33:24,182 --> 00:33:28,261
Amount us, all the great things
are being placed by God.

245
00:33:28,382 --> 00:33:32,462
The sacred of yours, has nothing
to do with the Jesus Christ

246
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:36,663
but your Pope thinks further.
- If you see the 1933 agreement,
you'll see the signature from the Pope.

247
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:40,865
1933? He can't predict
the things today.

248
00:33:40,984 --> 00:33:45,065
You attack Poland, then Frence,
Holland, Belgium, Luxembourg

249
00:33:45,184 --> 00:33:49,344
Oh yes? The Pope should knew it at that time
Threats from Bolshevism!

250
00:33:49,464 --> 00:33:53,545
He is very clear, our war is justice
He always sorrow for his own fate

251
00:33:53,666 --> 00:33:59,466
but in the East line of the Battle field,
Jesus Christ decides the future on his own

252
00:33:59,586 --> 00:34:03,947
Please take a look at this artifact!
Please look carefully!

253
00:34:08,708 --> 00:34:11,947
Our soldier saved it.

254
00:34:12,069 --> 00:34:16,989
They discovered that it is being used
by the Russian Moscow.
Area administrator as a stepping-stone.

255
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:21,188
Bolshevik changed the church of Russia
into Factories and Jail.

256
00:34:21,309 --> 00:34:26,869
They have no concern in destroying
the Christian and their precious artifacts.

257
00:34:29,310 --> 00:34:33,671
People serving god has been
tortured, killed, and expelled.

258
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:45,072
All these are Catholic sacrifice
under Bolshevism.

259
00:34:45,192 --> 00:34:50,753
These are your brothers!
Look at the small cross on the corpses.

260
00:34:50,913 --> 00:34:54,273
All these happened
just one year ago.

261
00:34:56,795 --> 00:35:02,355
Can you imagine,
can we make such rude crime?

262
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:08,875
In Dachau's camp, they'll only sentence
the priest into the cremation field

263
00:35:09,155 --> 00:35:14,116
people often see some priest lying
among the corpse and still alive

264
00:35:18,196 --> 00:35:23,758
but they still got executed

265
00:35:27,598 --> 00:35:33,638
Nazi think this is useful, people can
be forgive during the way to the heaven

266
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:45,080
Mr. Kremer

267
00:35:45,199 --> 00:35:49,161
You and I are mentally brothers.

268
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:53,801
Your mother realized this and she is surprised
that sacred statue has been damaged like this

269
00:35:53,921 --> 00:35:57,922
She is a true believer,
she believes you

270
00:35:58,042 --> 00:36:02,122
She believes that the coorpration between
Catholic and the Thrid emporer
is specially important.

271
00:36:02,242 --> 00:36:06,363
You can't resist this!

272
00:36:06,483 --> 00:36:11,324
what do you want from me?
From a priest pig coming from the church!

273
00:36:11,444 --> 00:36:15,364
The German cardinal already
kissed the Hitler's feet.

274
00:36:15,485 --> 00:36:19,525
Catholic will be very important after the battle
in Europe but the disappointed thing is...

275
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:23,766
The Priest League like this
will not exist anymore.

276
00:36:23,886 --> 00:36:28,286
Mr. Gebhardt,
have you ever think once?

277
00:36:28,406 --> 00:36:32,766
What will happen if the war failed?

278
00:36:33,367 --> 00:36:37,728
This is our war, Mr. Kremer.

279
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:42,208
This is a Crusade.

280
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:47,288
We have to keep praying,
use weapon to arm our soldiers.

281
00:36:47,408 --> 00:36:51,529
Otherwise, what covering us will only be chaos
I pray for the brothers of my inside
the prison camps

282
00:36:51,648 --> 00:36:55,730
for my family, for Luxembourg. German has a great
interest in the conversation with Vatican Pope.

283
00:36:55,850 --> 00:36:59,930
Think and respect
to the Luxembourg's wills.

284
00:37:00,049 --> 00:37:04,251
It's just your cardinal pope declined -
you want me to disobey the cardinal pope?

285
00:37:04,371 --> 00:37:08,451
no, we just hope you can make
him regain his rationality
and also the bell from the great church.

286
00:37:08,571 --> 00:37:12,691
He does not do any good things for Luxembourg.
He just holds the abolished policies in hands.

287
00:37:12,812 --> 00:37:17,773
For example: Heydrich.

288
00:37:18,573 --> 00:37:22,693
But there is another activity
going in our party.

289
00:37:22,813 --> 00:37:26,893
Church will be kept as people
wished and find a new way

290
00:37:27,014 --> 00:37:31,894
In Russian, they need missionary,
to preach to the people there

291
00:37:32,014 --> 00:37:36,975
Please sit down, we can have a good talk about
this problem... - This statue is in your office.

292
00:37:37,495 --> 00:37:40,855
It has no single effect on me.

293
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:48,298
Virgin Mary did not know,
the child in her arms...

294
00:37:48,417 --> 00:37:51,656
...would be crucified someday

295
00:37:52,377 --> 00:37:55,337
Where will you end it, priest?

296
00:37:55,458 --> 00:37:58,817
What will your mother say
about all of this?

297
00:37:59,058 --> 00:38:01,218
The martyr?

298
00:38:05,379 --> 00:38:08,339
Read this

299
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:17,421
Please read it out loudly!

300
00:38:19,421 --> 00:38:23,501
We, the conclavists of Luxemburg...

301
00:38:23,621 --> 00:38:26,742
...are advocates
of the Nazi's church policy

302
00:38:26,861 --> 00:38:31,503
We announce this in the name
of our truthful faith

303
00:38:31,622 --> 00:38:37,623
This is for our
holy church's existence

304
00:38:37,743 --> 00:38:42,264
only we stand in the side of the 3rd Reich and
its monarch Adolf Hitler, this can be possible

305
00:38:42,383 --> 00:38:45,624
Please give it to the conclavist

306
00:38:45,945 --> 00:38:50,265
If you don't receive a invitation
go to the parochial purser.

307
00:38:50,385 --> 00:38:56,706
He's a wise man,
he should be affected by this.

308
00:39:04,107 --> 00:39:08,027
Your sis is pregnant,
do you know that?

309
00:39:08,148 --> 00:39:11,507
I don't know.
How do you know it?

310
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:16,307
Goodbye! Take a good consideration.
There's not much days left of your holidays.

311
00:39:27,351 --> 00:39:30,709
Bless us, holy Mary

312
00:39:39,392 --> 00:39:43,752
Sir, I must talk to the conclavist

313
00:39:43,912 --> 00:39:48,272
I'm afraid it can be difficult.
He's in bad health.

314
00:39:48,392 --> 00:39:51,793
It's about all lives
of the priests in Luxemburg!

315
00:39:51,914 --> 00:39:56,274
The conclavist's on your side.
Your pain is his too.

316
00:39:56,394 --> 00:40:00,474
And it's also the whole Vatican's pain.
But excuse me, I can't let you present
yourself before him.

317
00:40:00,594 --> 00:40:05,795
Then which side are you on? The conclavist will
listen to you, won't he? Please don't do this!

318
00:40:05,915 --> 00:40:10,876
I can only give him advice. I have the thing
which Gebhardt'd like to give to the conclavist.

319
00:40:12,396 --> 00:40:17,076
I can deliver it.
No, I must talk to him.

320
00:40:17,196 --> 00:40:23,238
I'll see what I can do to help you.
Henry, I'll try my best.

321
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:46,801
Dear mother,
I don't know who I shall confess to.

322
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:52,601
I didn't know what the thirst's like before.
The sun can be so dreadful.

323
00:40:52,721 --> 00:40:56,681
They didn't give us water in the camp.
This kind of pain is indescribable.

324
00:40:56,801 --> 00:41:00,882
We were holed up in a labor camp...

325
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:04,963
...working for a powder mill.

326
00:41:11,444 --> 00:41:15,404
I don't know how to describe this...

327
00:41:15,604 --> 00:41:18,965
At that moment, my heart halted.

328
00:41:24,206 --> 00:41:30,526
I was dubitative, how can
there be water in that pipe?

329
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:44,568
You must talk to Henry,
he'll listen to you!

330
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:48,048
Tell him that...

331
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,448
Tell him what?

332
00:41:53,770 --> 00:41:58,529
The Gestapo won't compromise.
What on earth do they want from him?

333
00:41:58,650 --> 00:42:03,010
He puts us in grum danger.
You must know this!

334
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:07,011
Maria, talk to him

335
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:16,492
What can I tell him?
Ask him go back to the Dachau camp?

336
00:42:16,612 --> 00:42:20,934
You want he lose his family just because us?
You just want this, don't you?

337
00:42:21,053 --> 00:42:26,413
You're pregnant!
Don't pretend that you don't care.

338
00:42:28,614 --> 00:42:31,615
My late mother always said...

339
00:42:31,735 --> 00:42:34,974
He is our guardian angel.

340
00:42:37,215 --> 00:42:42,175
I really hope you can be like him,
just a little bit like him.

341
00:43:55,626 --> 00:43:58,586
Henry!

342
00:44:00,986 --> 00:44:03,147
Henry!

343
00:44:03,507 --> 00:44:05,667
Henry...

344
00:44:06,787 --> 00:44:10,747
Henry, let go!
It's me, Henry!

345
00:44:11,427 --> 00:44:14,787
What are you doing?
Henry! Let go!

346
00:44:16,469 --> 00:44:19,429
Henry!
Wake up... Henry

347
00:44:20,788 --> 00:44:22,949
Henry

348
00:45:16,036 --> 00:45:17,956
Good morning.

349
00:45:18,076 --> 00:45:23,037
Captain Gebhardt now has an appointment.
You have to wait for a while.

350
00:45:24,957 --> 00:45:26,839
Good morning.

351
00:45:26,958 --> 00:45:31,319
Please take a seat. What a pity,
it's cold in this restaurant.

352
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:40,959
What do you want to taste?
Be my guest.

353
00:45:41,279 --> 00:45:45,800
How about some scrambled eggs?
It's pretty delicious here.

354
00:45:45,921 --> 00:45:50,880
I'm honored that you came,
some coffee? - Okay

355
00:45:52,242 --> 00:45:56,321
I seldom come to Luxemburg.
I've settled in Lorraine.

356
00:45:56,442 --> 00:46:00,802
For better steel supply
to your weaponry production

357
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:06,444
Only prepare breakfast for this mister!
- Yes, sir.

358
00:46:09,843 --> 00:46:15,324
Our consul in France, Otto Abetz, he
collects lots of information about you.

359
00:46:15,444 --> 00:46:19,845
You've been to Paris to attend the economic
conference of the conquered country.

360
00:46:19,966 --> 00:46:24,045
In the meeting, you were asked
to improve productivity

361
00:46:24,166 --> 00:46:28,286
And you said to Abetz: Mr. consul,
this is difficult for me, because my
brother's being imprisoned in a camp prison.

362
00:46:28,405 --> 00:46:32,527
Mr. Kremer, if it was not me, your brother
was still in the Dachau camp.

363
00:46:32,646 --> 00:46:36,887
He'll be sent back there soon.

364
00:46:37,007 --> 00:46:41,047
I'm glad to help your brother.
He can be useful in the church.

365
00:46:41,168 --> 00:46:46,528
Only if he'd like to. I don't know a darned
thing about the church's problem.

366
00:46:46,648 --> 00:46:50,569
I only know something about the
carrying trade. For example...

367
00:46:50,688 --> 00:46:54,970
I know you're lack of construction material,
steel, aviation, fuel...

368
00:46:55,090 --> 00:47:00,050
Berlin lets yourselves solve them.
Perhaps I can give you some help.

369
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:04,330
You get a very high position,
though you're still very young,

370
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:08,532
You have to consider those issues!
Do you want to do business with me?

371
00:47:08,651 --> 00:47:12,611
We come here not for discussing this.
Thanks.

372
00:47:15,693 --> 00:47:20,132
I only hope, this talk will be a secret
just between two sane men.

373
00:47:20,253 --> 00:47:24,293
If I give the chief of the French Economic
Bureau a call, tell him...

374
00:47:24,413 --> 00:47:29,534
...what you said to me just now. Do you
think what consequence it would be?

375
00:47:29,654 --> 00:47:34,014
You'll put your brother right back
into the camp yourself.

376
00:48:01,058 --> 00:48:05,418
You're right, the egg is yum indeed!

377
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:24,181
Hail Hitler, captain, just a moment...

378
00:48:35,263 --> 00:48:40,824
Mr. Kremer, I didn't see you.
Please come in!

379
00:48:47,905 --> 00:48:51,266
Good Morning!
Please take a seat.

380
00:49:05,467 --> 00:49:08,428
What did he say?

381
00:49:08,867 --> 00:49:13,148
I didn't see him.
I don't mean the conclavist.

382
00:49:13,267 --> 00:49:16,228
What's the meaning of the song?

383
00:49:16,469 --> 00:49:23,030
It's my wife's favourite song.
But I don't know its meaning.

384
00:49:23,869 --> 00:49:29,351
You know both languages,
can you translate it?

385
00:49:32,270 --> 00:49:33,711
What?

386
00:49:33,831 --> 00:49:36,951
Beautiful memory...

387
00:49:37,070 --> 00:49:40,431
Please wait a minute!
The night full of bright stars...

388
00:49:41,912 --> 00:49:44,992
I don't understand

389
00:49:45,112 --> 00:49:47,473
Charming memory...

390
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:52,193
Sweet dream...
Sweet dream...

391
00:49:52,474 --> 00:49:58,514
And moonlight shining on the surface of
the ocean. Thanks, my wife's gonna love this

392
00:49:59,475 --> 00:50:03,554
I'm very sorry that you
didn't see the conclavist

393
00:50:03,675 --> 00:50:07,915
He's sick! I don't know
if he's gonna see me or not

394
00:50:08,035 --> 00:50:11,996
But nonetheless
I know just what he'll say

395
00:50:12,116 --> 00:50:15,475
Luxemburg is not
a Judas's country

396
00:50:19,237 --> 00:50:23,317
Do you know what my mentor did to me?

397
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:28,637
Judas... This treacherous action I've been
doing for a long time

398
00:50:29,518 --> 00:50:32,998
It's a fascinating phenomenon!

399
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:37,078
Jesus and Judas,
they're like brothers.

400
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,800
They depend on each other.

401
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,841
But Judas betrayed Jesus
for thirty silver coins.

402
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:49,041
But he didn't take any,
he threw them away into a temple.

403
00:50:49,160 --> 00:50:55,202
It implies that he didn't betray Jesus for money.
Judas is cursed! God forsook him.

404
00:50:55,642 --> 00:51:00,003
That's what we learnt
in our religion course.

405
00:51:01,043 --> 00:51:04,364
I think Judas is devout.

406
00:51:04,483 --> 00:51:09,843
Maybe the devoutest disciple of all time.
Yes, he's also an idealist.

407
00:51:09,964 --> 00:51:13,884
Just like any Jewish liberator.

408
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:18,084
With the help of Jesus, he planned a rebellion
against the king, the country and the bishop.

409
00:51:18,204 --> 00:51:21,405
Please say no more!

410
00:51:21,525 --> 00:51:24,766
What are those theological
discussion for?

411
00:51:24,886 --> 00:51:29,846
I have no interests in discussing
my belief with you.

412
00:51:34,566 --> 00:51:37,807
Your holiday does its job.

413
00:51:38,568 --> 00:51:42,928
You become more direct!
That's great!

414
00:51:43,288 --> 00:51:46,528
It makes your speaking vivid.

415
00:51:51,769 --> 00:51:56,169
My mother wished me
to become a priest.

416
00:51:56,291 --> 00:52:01,531
A priest just like you. She also hoped
I could gain honors for my family.

417
00:52:01,651 --> 00:52:06,011
Her son's serving in church,
which'll make her very pride.

418
00:52:06,891 --> 00:52:12,452
A priest is just a Jack-a-Lent.
She knew this very well.

419
00:52:15,092 --> 00:52:17,772
She was very devout.

420
00:52:17,893 --> 00:52:21,133
But she's also
just a mortal on earth.

421
00:52:22,293 --> 00:52:27,373
She once sent me to
a dance school to study.

422
00:52:27,495 --> 00:52:31,855
I've tried my best to avoid becoming
a priest, not for her.

423
00:52:31,975 --> 00:52:36,015
I always believe that you can become
what you want to become.

424
00:52:36,135 --> 00:52:40,296
It's not vital whether you're
in camp prison or not.

425
00:52:40,416 --> 00:52:45,377
Please go and persuade the conclavist.
Like what Judas did to the bishop?

426
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:50,257
Yes! Judas was an adventurous man.
He wanted to change the world.

427
00:52:50,496 --> 00:52:56,377
He thought Jesus was the king of the world.
But God appointed him other mission.

428
00:52:56,497 --> 00:53:01,378
Betrayal doesn't belong to God's holy plan.
It's just a small step in the plan.

429
00:53:01,498 --> 00:53:05,619
The Holy Bible says, Judas is the strongest
apostle. He can accomplish this errand.

430
00:53:05,738 --> 00:53:09,820
No Judas, no crucifix.

431
00:53:09,940 --> 00:53:15,501
Then there's also no God's salvation.
You mean, "no Judas, no church"?

432
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:21,700
You understand what I mean.

433
00:53:22,702 --> 00:53:28,182
On the contrary, the conclavist
doesn't accept these new thoughts.

434
00:53:28,302 --> 00:53:32,663
What Judas did is an enlightenment.
Please consider it.

435
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:39,864
It will be a helpful
experience for you.

436
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:43,584
It changes me a lot.

437
00:53:52,585 --> 00:53:55,786
May peace be with you...

438
00:53:55,905 --> 00:53:59,266
...forever, amen.
Hail Hitler.

439
00:54:30,630 --> 00:54:33,590
Henry, get in.

440
00:54:42,552 --> 00:54:46,632
You must leave quickly! Come to Paris with me.
You can hide there...

441
00:54:46,752 --> 00:54:51,152
...and continue working for the French.
Or you can go to Genevese, I can help you.

442
00:54:51,274 --> 00:54:55,193
Find the Red Cross!
I can't abandon you.

443
00:54:55,314 --> 00:54:58,673
Listen, you're bluffing now!

444
00:55:01,914 --> 00:55:06,676
You lost your car?
I demand his personal explanation!

445
00:55:06,795 --> 00:55:10,795
Lost? - We tracked them down
all the way to the stronghold.

446
00:55:10,916 --> 00:55:15,036
The army blocked the road, we had to stop.
When the road was opened, it was too late.

447
00:55:15,155 --> 00:55:20,717
I have your personal assurance!

448
00:55:23,597 --> 00:55:28,558
Stop! I'll take you to a safe place in
despite of you like it or not

449
00:55:28,677 --> 00:55:31,639
You must stop.

450
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:41,400
Are you nuts?
Yes, I am!

451
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:47,560
A prisoner of the camp is on his holiday.
A group of Gestapoes with cigars
in their mouths track me down.

452
00:55:48,441 --> 00:55:52,842
Do you know what they want from me?
They want to destroy my belief!

453
00:55:52,961 --> 00:55:58,522
They want me to betray my church.
"No Judas, no Jesus. " Do you understand?

454
00:56:00,563 --> 00:56:04,643
Only the strong one can survive the camp prison.
Only the cunning man can achieve his goal.

455
00:56:04,762 --> 00:56:08,844
Only like this, a man can find a way out for all.
As for you, two weeks at most.

456
00:56:08,964 --> 00:56:13,044
You'll need a linkman in the kitchen.
Only he can feed you.

457
00:56:13,164 --> 00:56:17,245
You will know how people die in
a labor camp after four weeks.

458
00:56:17,365 --> 00:56:21,406
Yes, for surviving,
people must think carefully.

459
00:56:21,525 --> 00:56:25,405
You can, but I can't.

460
00:56:41,447 --> 00:56:44,688
What's up?

461
00:56:45,368 --> 00:56:48,729
You leave from my house, quickly!

462
00:56:49,970 --> 00:56:52,569
What are you looking for?

463
00:56:52,689 --> 00:56:56,049
Who are you?
What do you want?

464
00:56:56,169 --> 00:56:59,410
No other persons.
Now what to do?

465
00:57:02,771 --> 00:57:05,731
Where's your brother?

466
00:57:06,492 --> 00:57:10,852
I warn you, tell us
whatever you know at once

467
00:57:10,972 --> 00:57:15,492
If he gets away, I'll arrest you.
Tell us everything!

468
00:57:15,613 --> 00:57:18,852
I don't know where he is.

469
00:57:20,372 --> 00:57:22,533
Arrest her!

470
00:57:24,573 --> 00:57:27,534
Let me put on my overcoat.

471
00:57:38,935 --> 00:57:41,095
There's no need for you anymore.
Leave.

472
00:57:46,576 --> 00:57:50,657
How can you do this to my sis,
my brother and my sis's husband?

473
00:57:50,777 --> 00:57:55,497
Isn't it enough for just arresting me?
Must our whole family go to camp prison?

474
00:57:55,617 --> 00:58:00,139
What the heck are you worrying about?
Me? My family?

475
00:58:00,259 --> 00:58:03,219
Or the whole Luxemburg?

476
00:58:27,662 --> 00:58:31,902
I'm dreadful sorry for bringing
so much trouble to you.

477
00:58:44,183 --> 00:58:47,424
You're my brother!

478
00:59:02,387 --> 00:59:06,347
I thought you went
to Paris with Irmgard.

479
00:59:07,387 --> 00:59:10,628
He went there alone.

480
00:59:12,427 --> 00:59:15,668
I saw him off.

481
00:59:51,193 --> 00:59:53,993
Dear mother

482
00:59:54,113 --> 01:00:00,433
The next night there's only one single
thing in my mind. And that's water.

483
01:00:02,594 --> 01:00:05,115
Do not move, you filth prisoner!

484
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:08,195
Take off your hat!

485
01:00:08,795 --> 01:00:11,756
Number off!

486
01:00:13,075 --> 01:00:17,477
I keep asking myself whether I should
share this with my brothers.

487
01:00:17,597 --> 01:00:21,958
Or just tell Nansen,
who's the weakest among us.

488
01:00:22,916 --> 01:00:27,838
I pray to God, but the pain of thirst
is stronger than anything.

489
01:00:27,959 --> 01:00:31,119
The next day I come there again.

490
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:35,279
There's not much water.
But it's enough for one person.

491
01:00:35,399 --> 01:00:39,320
Warm, a little bit salt.
It's so wonderful.

492
01:00:39,439 --> 01:00:43,639
It moistens my dry lips,
it's so tasteful. - Kremer?

493
01:00:43,761 --> 01:00:45,920
Kremer?

494
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:51,642
Go back to your row.
The chief warden's looking for you.

495
01:00:53,922 --> 01:00:57,842
At that monment I comprehended
I was a sinner.

496
01:00:57,963 --> 01:01:01,962
I was a greedy selfish sinner.

497
01:01:02,082 --> 01:01:06,003
Water, water!
Don't give up. Listen, don't give up!

498
01:01:06,123 --> 01:01:10,083
I'm not gonna make it!
God is testing us!

499
01:01:10,204 --> 01:01:14,083
God's with us!
It's ok...

500
01:01:14,205 --> 01:01:17,165
It's ok...

501
01:01:18,405 --> 01:01:21,645
God trusts us!

502
01:01:23,726 --> 01:01:25,886
Kremer

503
01:01:39,687 --> 01:01:44,968
Merciful God, forgive me, forgive me.
Only like this, again and again.

504
01:01:45,089 --> 01:01:48,049
Mother, forgive me.

505
01:02:34,415 --> 01:02:37,376
Yes, I survive...

506
01:02:37,495 --> 01:02:39,895
Nansen dies...

507
01:02:40,015 --> 01:02:44,897
The question haunts me all the time.
Those water...

508
01:02:45,016 --> 01:02:48,976
If I shared those water with him,
would he survive?

509
01:02:49,097 --> 01:02:52,058
After that, I saw his face
in my dream every night.

510
01:02:52,177 --> 01:02:56,538
I followed his steps.

511
01:03:05,379 --> 01:03:08,619
Why don't say something?

512
01:03:13,060 --> 01:03:17,020
You're not responsible
for your friend's death.

513
01:03:23,942 --> 01:03:28,622
You just think
you could have saved him.

514
01:03:28,743 --> 01:03:32,103
And he didn't blame you either.

515
01:04:28,630 --> 01:04:32,711
The encyclical says...

516
01:04:32,830 --> 01:04:34,871
All the buring pain will burn out.

517
01:04:34,991 --> 01:04:40,551
The Nazi violently betrayed
Jesus Christ.

518
01:04:41,351 --> 01:04:44,712
Hatred and blood spreads everywhere.

519
01:04:49,713 --> 01:04:52,113
Please believe me.

520
01:04:52,233 --> 01:04:56,313
Since the very first day,
I've just wanted to hug Kremer.

521
01:04:56,435 --> 01:05:01,475
But if Gebhardt asked him to come,
then I cannot see him.

522
01:05:01,594 --> 01:05:04,836
And that's also because of him.

523
01:05:08,635 --> 01:05:12,716
This is an announcement which the Vatican
sends to the Berlin Reich Security Office HQ.

524
01:05:12,836 --> 01:05:16,916
For seeking for building a new type
of European church policy.

525
01:05:17,036 --> 01:05:21,518
The denial of this chance
is a loss to Luxemburg.

526
01:05:21,638 --> 01:05:25,718
If only Luxemburg agreed the bishop's
resolution that day and...

527
01:05:25,838 --> 01:05:29,919
expressed to support Nazi's church policy,
then it would be a trophy to Berlin.

528
01:05:30,039 --> 01:05:34,719
Alienating the relationship between Rome and us.
I told Kremer about this.

529
01:05:34,840 --> 01:05:39,200
But as the conclavist, you should have
much more resource to manipulate.

530
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:48,641
When will Kremer end his
so-called "holiday"?

531
01:05:49,041 --> 01:05:52,002
In three days.

532
01:05:57,762 --> 01:06:02,722
What's your opinion?
Is it just a fate for one single priest?

533
01:06:04,284 --> 01:06:07,523
Or for other reasons?

534
01:06:07,642 --> 01:06:11,604
You can't help me anymore...

535
01:06:11,844 --> 01:06:14,004
Sir.

536
01:07:26,174 --> 01:07:28,334
Please come in.

537
01:07:39,935 --> 01:07:44,296
Do you get any message
from the Bishop?

538
01:07:44,616 --> 01:07:46,776
No?

539
01:07:47,456 --> 01:07:51,737
Then please be more!
You don't come here for relaxation.

540
01:07:51,857 --> 01:07:55,938
You can go back today!
Yes, he's a patient.

541
01:07:56,057 --> 01:08:00,018
I hope he die as soon as possible. It would
settle everything with the parochial purser.

542
01:08:00,138 --> 01:08:04,179
This damn poor sow priest!

543
01:08:04,299 --> 01:08:08,220
Sow priest? - He's the spiritual
mentor of the whole Luxemburg.

544
01:08:08,339 --> 01:08:12,420
In my opinion, he's just a poor worm
who's crimpling in his robe all day.

545
01:08:12,540 --> 01:08:16,499
You and I, we're aboveboard.

546
01:08:16,621 --> 01:08:20,661
Or maybe there're other people?
I think I know what you're thinking.

547
01:08:20,781 --> 01:08:24,142
Say something

548
01:08:26,343 --> 01:08:29,542
I think you know nothing about this!

549
01:08:29,662 --> 01:08:34,143
Under your order, what's going on there
in the camp prison?

550
01:08:34,262 --> 01:08:38,263
You think you would know everything
about the camp prison if you just
had a talk with its commander?

551
01:08:38,383 --> 01:08:42,544
What do you know? Thousands of German soldiers
died in the east line.

552
01:08:42,663 --> 01:08:47,024
This is the monarch's command.
This is God's wish.

553
01:08:52,345 --> 01:08:56,306
Why don't you become a priest?

554
01:08:57,666 --> 01:09:01,626
You finally asked
a good question.

555
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:30,230
A glass of water?

556
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:38,750
I've read your doctorial thesis,
it's really nice.

557
01:09:38,871 --> 01:09:42,952
There are so much proof
to prove God's existence.

558
01:09:43,072 --> 01:09:49,632
The subject is a limelight.
But it felt wonderful to throw a boomerang.

559
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:52,313
Truly.

560
01:09:52,873 --> 01:09:56,234
It's a philosophical sport.

561
01:10:01,874 --> 01:10:06,235
Whatever you throw away,
it'll go back to you.

562
01:10:12,516 --> 01:10:16,557
Mister Gebhardt, the conclavist
doesn't want to see me.

563
01:10:16,676 --> 01:10:20,757
Even if he does, he'll never
agree to sign. Never

564
01:10:20,877 --> 01:10:24,237
We don't care about him!
Follow me!

565
01:10:24,598 --> 01:10:28,559
You write this down:
Luxemburg belongs to the Reich.

566
01:10:28,678 --> 01:10:32,758
One country, one Roman Catholicism.
German church policy...

567
01:10:32,879 --> 01:10:36,960
doesn't violate the Vatican. The Catholic
priests of Luxemburg support this policy.

568
01:10:37,079 --> 01:10:41,160
You, Priest Kremer announce
it publicly.

569
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:47,321
You criticize the conclavist publicly.
You must finish this by tomorrow.

570
01:10:59,682 --> 01:11:04,083
Just two days before
I left the seminary

571
01:11:04,203 --> 01:11:10,244
I denied to wear the black uniform,
this is my own action against God.

572
01:11:11,324 --> 01:11:13,284
Yes.

573
01:11:13,884 --> 01:11:17,125
I was vice officiant at that time.

574
01:11:19,165 --> 01:11:23,885
As a priest, can I change this world?
I can't.

575
01:11:24,005 --> 01:11:28,086
Can I make this world a better place? I can't
either. But in the camp of our monarch...

576
01:11:28,206 --> 01:11:32,286
Under his great lead, I feel like I'm
important.

577
01:11:32,406 --> 01:11:36,527
I drive the wheel of the history to run, and I've
already done it in my heart for a long time.

578
01:11:36,647 --> 01:11:43,208
My faith gives me strength to accomplish
all of my errands.

579
01:11:43,328 --> 01:11:45,488
Judas!

580
01:11:46,009 --> 01:11:49,968
You are it!
- Ah, finally you get it!

581
01:11:50,968 --> 01:11:56,609
I think you just comprehended the
true meaning of Judas.

582
01:11:56,730 --> 01:12:01,129
Why don't you drink up the water? Back
in the camp, you should have drunk it up already.

583
01:12:01,251 --> 01:12:05,651
Although you didn't say it,
but I know.

584
01:12:05,771 --> 01:12:09,692
You betrayed your brothers in arms,
for surviving.

585
01:12:09,811 --> 01:12:13,771
You finally make your life
meaningful.

586
01:12:18,133 --> 01:12:23,653
If I did what you told me, what would happen
to my brothers in the camp prison?

587
01:12:23,773 --> 01:12:27,853
You don't believe
the justice of God?

588
01:12:27,975 --> 01:12:32,054
Everyone cooperate with us
will be set free.

589
01:12:32,175 --> 01:12:35,615
Be set free?
Yes, just get his agreement.

590
01:12:35,735 --> 01:12:39,815
You should write for living,
not for dead.

591
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:44,655
Your fate is on your hand
I am waiting for your compellent report.

592
01:12:44,777 --> 01:12:49,617
Just as the wonderful article
which against law of race.

593
01:13:38,264 --> 01:13:41,504
Sorry, Henry.

594
01:13:41,983 --> 01:13:44,945
Go ahead, I wait here.

595
01:14:04,147 --> 01:14:08,387
We just excrete only once one day
in the concentration camp and finish
it in one minute, if we don't finish it

596
01:14:08,507 --> 01:14:11,748
he will face the menace of death.

597
01:14:11,908 --> 01:14:16,869
Doctor is the best of us,
he can finish it in just 10 sec.

598
01:14:17,148 --> 01:14:20,509
Why didn't you go to Switzerland?

599
01:14:21,029 --> 01:14:23,708
We can help you.

600
01:14:23,830 --> 01:14:28,910
Raymond knew a guy of Germany Railroad,
please try it.

601
01:14:29,750 --> 01:14:33,872
You knew some friends of Bodensee
so you can hide over there for some days

602
01:14:33,991 --> 01:14:39,552
and you can swim to the other bank
so that's Switzerland.

603
01:14:44,913 --> 01:14:49,753
I am sorry to bother so earlier
is the father Kremer here? - Yes.

604
01:14:53,753 --> 01:14:58,114
Henry, do you think
I am a bad man, right?

605
01:14:58,554 --> 01:15:00,114
No

606
01:15:00,234 --> 01:15:02,874
But a caitiff?

607
01:15:02,996 --> 01:15:07,035
Somtimes people have
no choice except recreance.

608
01:15:07,156 --> 01:15:10,515
Trust me, I knew it.

609
01:15:11,756 --> 01:15:15,716
I have been always asking myself
since you are back, why...

610
01:15:15,836 --> 01:15:20,077
You can bring me courage?
But not anyone can do this.

611
01:15:20,196 --> 01:15:24,278
You should be around of exarch. You have
responsibility of the whole church of Luxemburg.

612
01:15:24,397 --> 01:15:30,438
I have no power to criticize you.

613
01:15:30,878 --> 01:15:34,119
Cardinal is waiting for us.

614
01:15:39,399 --> 01:15:42,320
I have family too.

615
01:15:42,439 --> 01:15:46,801
Somtimes I will consider them
more than church.

616
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,241
Me too.

617
01:16:21,965 --> 01:16:25,325
Father, glad to see you.

618
01:16:28,966 --> 01:16:32,966
Glad to see you too.

619
01:16:33,087 --> 01:16:39,408
You look good, that's great.
Now, there are some problems of diplomatism.

620
01:16:39,607 --> 01:16:39,689
Come here, father, sit down.

621
01:16:45,009 --> 01:16:49,609
Sir, I am in a rough situation
I must make a decision.

622
01:16:49,729 --> 01:16:53,169
Mersch has told me,
I have nothing to suggest

623
01:16:53,210 --> 01:16:57,450
but as a father you must know

624
01:16:58,409 --> 01:17:02,770
in the soup,
people should defer conscience.

625
01:17:03,731 --> 01:17:07,691
So, please defer vocation
of conscience, believe god,

626
01:17:08,252 --> 01:17:12,372
let holy belief help you.

627
01:17:13,053 --> 01:17:17,692
Please forgive me, but I have asked
my conscience for million times

628
01:17:18,333 --> 01:17:23,133
I asked for god, but I got nothing.

629
01:17:23,854 --> 01:17:27,894
I come here with full of hope.
Sir, I need your help.

630
01:17:28,535 --> 01:17:32,455
You reject my suggestion?
- Please try to understand me!

631
01:17:32,974 --> 01:17:38,615
My brother of concentration camp was killed on the
cross. It's true! There is a cross on their back.

632
01:17:43,057 --> 01:17:47,417
There is no god in that place
where I came from.

633
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:08,460
I have never been off this house,
since being occupied by Germany.

634
01:18:08,779 --> 01:18:13,061
I have never had conversation with the
chief of staff of the occupied army.

635
01:18:13,180 --> 01:18:17,261
Yes, I made the jow of church loud
all of Luxemburg knew the reason.

636
01:18:17,380 --> 01:18:21,860
The spirit of god
spread everywhere.

637
01:18:21,981 --> 01:18:25,901
Maybe the spirit of god fill with...
- Father...

638
01:18:26,023 --> 01:18:30,462
I don't want to know
what Gebhardt ask you do.

639
01:18:30,582 --> 01:18:33,942
You are imposed by him

640
01:18:34,663 --> 01:18:38,863
but if you have any doubt
of church...

641
01:18:38,983 --> 01:18:44,544
I have never been suspicious of church
but I suspect god sometimes.

642
01:18:46,184 --> 01:18:50,145
Do you know every thing
happened in Holland?

643
01:18:51,185 --> 01:18:55,545
Nazi killed
all Christian of non-Aryan.

644
01:18:56,027 --> 01:19:00,146
Dejong, the local cardinal give up.

645
01:19:00,265 --> 01:19:04,347
He published a cardinal announce

646
01:19:04,466 --> 01:19:08,828
all Christian of non-Aryan in that area
were killed more than 40000 people

647
01:19:10,067 --> 01:19:14,029
What do you think
what did Papacy do?

648
01:19:14,269 --> 01:19:19,228
Just one cardinal announce
kill 40000 people.

649
01:19:20,629 --> 01:19:25,590
How did it work for your demurral?

650
01:19:25,869 --> 01:19:32,151
200000 or 300000 sacrifice?

651
01:19:40,792 --> 01:19:43,752
But I should...

652
01:19:45,273 --> 01:19:48,513
Should I become Judas?

653
01:19:52,273 --> 01:19:56,233
Is this Gebhardt ask you do?

654
01:19:57,354 --> 01:20:00,234
Yes.

655
01:20:04,274 --> 01:20:07,275
There is something you don't know.

656
01:20:07,396 --> 01:20:11,756
I should not tell you there.

657
01:20:12,436 --> 01:20:16,797
Gebhardt made me get into
a big puzzledom of conscience.

658
01:20:18,276 --> 01:20:20,236
Really?

659
01:20:20,597 --> 01:20:26,158
He used work in a concentration camp
in east, he said that's for democracy.

660
01:20:26,358 --> 01:20:30,398
When I asked him what did he do,
he answered,

661
01:20:30,519 --> 01:20:33,878
nothing, but I knew it.

662
01:21:44,489 --> 01:21:47,849
No! No! Stop.

663
01:22:48,056 --> 01:22:52,416
I am so glad, everyone has
the good rhythm today, right?

664
01:22:52,537 --> 01:22:56,657
If there is a litter flute
that will be better.

665
01:22:56,777 --> 01:22:58,938
Gebhardt...

666
01:23:01,299 --> 01:23:04,538
You deal with it.

667
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:10,780
Come on.

668
01:23:19,821 --> 01:23:21,981
How about it?

669
01:23:28,822 --> 01:23:36,303
The people who believe god believe that Jesus
is righteous, so he has to do it, hasn't he?

670
01:23:37,263 --> 01:23:41,383
It seems that you suspect god
more than me, father.

671
01:23:42,944 --> 01:23:47,304
Here you are.

672
01:23:55,025 --> 01:23:58,226
Father, you are a smart guy.

673
01:24:00,386 --> 01:24:04,147
You save your life
and save your family's too.

674
01:24:05,308 --> 01:24:10,228
You also save all priests' lives
of Luxemburg's church.

675
01:24:12,748 --> 01:24:17,749
I always ask during the period, why choose me,
why not choose the chief of main deanery.

676
01:24:17,869 --> 01:24:22,990
You yourself also say
he is a smart guy.

677
01:24:37,270 --> 01:24:39,832
But...

678
01:24:40,511 --> 01:24:43,591
he lacks something.

679
01:24:47,753 --> 01:24:51,274
He never comes into
concentration camp.

680
01:24:51,433 --> 01:24:55,513
How does he know the suffer
in the concentration camp?

681
01:24:55,634 --> 01:24:58,954
Behind the evil?

682
01:25:02,554 --> 01:25:06,635
What do you see in the
east concentration camp?

683
01:27:57,658 --> 01:28:02,059
Prisoner 25639,
Henry Kremer.

684
01:28:03,338 --> 01:28:05,819
I come back.

685
01:28:05,938 --> 01:28:08,540
Get out.

686
01:29:17,629 --> 01:29:23,910
Henry Kremer is name that
really lived among other things.

687
01:29:24,029 --> 01:29:30,310
Several thousand priestess from every country
like him were put in the concentration camp
of Dachau during World War II...

688
01:29:30,710 --> 01:29:40,311
...half of them died. Kremer belonged
to them, that escaped the death.
