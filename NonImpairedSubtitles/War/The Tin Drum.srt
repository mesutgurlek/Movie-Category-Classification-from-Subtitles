1
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,786
I'll begin long before I existed.

2
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,888
When the time came for
my poor mama to be born...

3
00:01:39,966 --> 00:01:43,527
my grandmother Anna Bronski...

4
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:46,094
who was still young
and unsuspecting...

5
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:50,872
was sitting in her four skirts
at the edge of a potato field.

6
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:54,471
That was in 1899...

7
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:57,448
in the heart of Kashubia.

8
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:26,204
Please!

9
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,781
He's gone.

10
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:09,617
Anybody come this way?

11
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:11,584
Name of Koljaiczek?

12
00:03:11,658 --> 00:03:15,458
- A firebug.
- Short with broad shoulders.

13
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:19,192
I seen him! Running like
a bat out of hell!

14
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:20,629
Which way?

15
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:30,109
I don't believe it.

16
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,978
- Doesn't matter. He's gone.
- Must be in Bissau.

17
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,321
If he's not here,
it has to be one or the other.

18
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:49,157
There's no place else.

19
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,627
And besides, it's raining.

20
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,643
All right, Koljaiczek.

21
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,818
My name is Joseph.

22
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:28,323
Joseph and Anna hid
with the raftsmen...

23
00:05:28,361 --> 00:05:30,955
for almost a year.

24
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:36,727
That's how long
it took the police to catch up...

25
00:05:36,769 --> 00:05:38,634
with my grandfather.

26
00:05:50,616 --> 00:05:52,379
Don't shoot!

27
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:59,684
- Don't shoot him!
- Fire at will!

28
00:06:09,802 --> 00:06:12,293
After that dive...

29
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:15,930
Koljaiczek was never seen again.

30
00:06:16,676 --> 00:06:19,941
Some say he was drowned...

31
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:21,840
some that he...

32
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:24,008
escaped to America...

33
00:06:24,083 --> 00:06:28,452
and in Chicago,
under the name of Joe Colchic...

34
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,888
became a millionaire.

35
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:35,319
They say he made his pile in lumber...

36
00:06:35,595 --> 00:06:38,860
in matches...

37
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:43,768
and in fire insurance.

38
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:58,248
As for my grandmother...

39
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:02,917
she sat year after year
in her four skirts...

40
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,958
hawking her wares in the market.

41
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,019
Geese!

42
00:07:10,062 --> 00:07:12,758
Not too fat and not too lean!

43
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:15,131
And she grew older.

44
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,404
The First World War came...

45
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:22,464
and instead of geese...

46
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,604
she had only
turnips to sell.

47
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,656
Turnips!

48
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,890
My poor mother grew older too.

49
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:47,060
She was worried
about her cousin Jan.

50
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,499
Jan had been called up for duty.

51
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,874
- Name!
- Bronski, Jan.

52
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:58,536
- Year?.
- 1898.

53
00:07:59,145 --> 00:08:00,237
Cough.

54
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,579
Rejected!

55
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,521
They've turned me down
for another year!

56
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,026
For the first time, my mother...

57
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:22,329
held her cousin Jan in her arms...

58
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:23,960
and I doubt...

59
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:28,667
if they ever embranced
more happily.

60
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:39,583
Sister Agnes, is there too much paprika?
Or does it need more clove?

61
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,028
What did she say?

62
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,698
She says you're a born cook,
Mr. Matzerath.

63
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,532
You know how to turn
feelings into soup.

64
00:09:15,154 --> 00:09:19,181
The war had spent itself.

65
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,352
Danzig was declared a Free State.

66
00:09:22,495 --> 00:09:23,985
The poles were given...

67
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:25,759
their own post office...

68
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:29,131
where Jan Bronski went to work.

69
00:09:29,302 --> 00:09:32,362
Alfred Matzerath also
stayed in Danzig.

70
00:09:35,608 --> 00:09:39,135
We Kashubians
have always been here.

71
00:09:39,712 --> 00:09:41,577
Long before the Poles...

72
00:09:41,847 --> 00:09:44,338
and naturally
long before the Germans.

73
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,011
Old stuff, Jan.
Now we've got peace!

74
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,178
Germans, Poles, Kashubians--

75
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,052
we'll all live together in peace.

76
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:56,518
I don't know.

77
00:09:58,030 --> 00:09:59,691
Well, you'll see.

78
00:10:08,474 --> 00:10:12,171
The two men, so different despite
their similar feelings for Mama...

79
00:10:12,244 --> 00:10:15,736
liked each other...

80
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:20,275
and in that triunity,
they brought me, Oskar...

81
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,219
into the world.

82
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:27,622
The sun was in the sign of Virgo.

83
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,824
Neptune moved
into the house of middle life...

84
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:35,833
establishing Oskar
between faith and disillusion.

85
00:11:06,532 --> 00:11:09,194
Push, push!

86
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:16,341
Push, Agnes, push!
Push hard!

87
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:24,941
It's coming! It's coming!

88
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:28,753
I first saw the light of this world...

89
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,416
in the form of a 60-watt bulb.

90
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:35,188
Alfred, it's a boy!

91
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,103
I knew it would be a boy...

92
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:50,133
even if I sometimes said
it would be a girl.

93
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:01,116
Let's see how much he weighs.

94
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:08,224
When he's big,
he'll take over the shop.

95
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:11,954
Now we know what
we're slaving for.

96
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:15,233
When little Oskar is
three years old...

97
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:17,826
he shall have a tin drum.

98
00:12:19,505 --> 00:12:24,306
Only the prospect
of the tin drum prevented me...

99
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:27,801
from expressing more
forcefully my desire...

100
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:30,213
to return to the womb.

101
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:32,341
Besides, my umbilical cord
had been cut.

102
00:12:32,384 --> 00:12:35,785
There was nothing
more to be done.

103
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:52,128
As it was, I could hardly wait
'til my third birthday.

104
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,264
What is it?

105
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:30,606
Oh, it's little Oskar!

106
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:32,970
Do you want some more cake?

107
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:36,606
Your mouth's filthy.

108
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,570
Respect the human body. That's--

109
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,870
And with rolls at 3 pfennings--

110
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:08,680
The main thing is a stable currency.

111
00:14:09,281 --> 00:14:11,772
And plenty to drink!

112
00:14:11,984 --> 00:14:16,387
Here's to the stable mark
and the 3-pfenning roll!

113
00:14:19,825 --> 00:14:21,884
To youth!

114
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:23,724
And to beauty!

115
00:14:31,036 --> 00:14:35,268
We won't be so young
when we meet again!

116
00:14:44,984 --> 00:14:49,614
Love, oh love

117
00:14:49,688 --> 00:14:53,818
is a power divine!

118
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,778
September 12...

119
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,814
1927.

120
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:00,654
Next year, you'll be this big!

121
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,491
And then, this big! And this.

122
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,224
And then as big as me!

123
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,253
Gangway!

124
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,429
Fresh from the celler!

125
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:23,213
- Playing, Mr. Scheffler?.
- Heavens, no!

126
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:25,909
Go ahead. I'll just watch.

127
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:27,950
Besides, it's my bedtime.

128
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:31,980
- He's always tired.
- You shouldn't have married a baker.

129
00:16:45,604 --> 00:16:48,630
It's been a long time since Grandma
took anyone under her skirts.

130
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:50,938
Let's have a little game!

131
00:17:14,933 --> 00:17:17,766
Hey, cousin, you're out of diamonds!

132
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:21,439
Don't argue! Play!

133
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,673
I have two diamonds myself.

134
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:32,717
How would I now?

135
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,750
That day...

136
00:17:37,956 --> 00:17:40,754
thinking about the
grown-up world...

137
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:44,752
and my own future...

138
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:47,493
I decided to call a halt...

139
00:17:47,533 --> 00:17:51,629
to stop growing then and there...

140
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,104
and remain a three-year-old...

141
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,505
a gnome, once and for all.

142
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:36,939
One, two, three.

143
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,307
God! There he is!

144
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,370
What happened?

145
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:41,539
He's fallen down the stairs!

146
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,270
Do something!

147
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,680
Why was the trap open?

148
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,017
He's bleeding!

149
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:53,884
Alfred, it's your fault.
You left the door open!

150
00:19:53,959 --> 00:19:56,757
I was only getting beer
for everybody.

151
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:04,561
Run and get the doctor!

152
00:20:05,771 --> 00:20:09,901
- It looks bad.
- You! You! It's your fault.

153
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,172
You left the trap open!

154
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:17,504
Stop! Stop!

155
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:27,323
Calm down!
What's done is done!

156
00:20:44,343 --> 00:20:49,007
Two weeks in bed
and Oskar will be as good as new.

157
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,817
Just a slight concussion.

158
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,883
Plenty of cold compresses.

159
00:20:56,955 --> 00:21:00,584
My fall was a complete success.

160
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:04,390
The family story was:
On his third birthday...

161
00:21:04,463 --> 00:21:07,830
our little Oskar
fell down the cellar stairs.

162
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:11,835
No bones were broken,
but after that, he didn't grow--

163
00:21:11,903 --> 00:21:13,700
not a single centimeter.

164
00:21:16,308 --> 00:21:20,142
That drum again!
So loud!

165
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,318
So there's my little Oskar,
all well again.

166
00:21:41,099 --> 00:21:42,589
Not in the house, I said!

167
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,966
Besides, it's broken.
You'll hurt yourself.

168
00:21:45,037 --> 00:21:47,835
- Staying? There are mushrooms.
- Sorry. Post office time.

169
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:49,534
Leave the drum here.

170
00:21:49,608 --> 00:21:52,202
If you hurt yourself,
it will be my fault again.

171
00:21:53,545 --> 00:21:55,877
See? I told you so.

172
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:02,481
Give me that drum
and I'll give you a candy.

173
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:06,318
Let them have it.
I'll get you a new one.

174
00:22:06,425 --> 00:22:08,256
No! Oskar don't want!

175
00:22:08,293 --> 00:22:09,988
We'll see about that.

176
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:10,990
Alfred, why must you...

177
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:12,496
always use force?

178
00:22:13,198 --> 00:22:15,132
My drum!

179
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:38,746
And so I discovered that my voice
was capable of a scream...

180
00:22:38,824 --> 00:22:40,621
so highly pitched...

181
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:45,892
that no one dared
take my drum away...

182
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:48,089
Shards bring luck!

183
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:53,560
because when my drum was
taken away, I screamed...

184
00:22:53,638 --> 00:22:58,473
and when I screamed,
valuable articles burst into bits.

185
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:03,174
Where's the witch, black as pitch?

186
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,351
Here's the black, wicked witch!

187
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:27,067
There are going to be changes!

188
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:30,107
Scum! Beat it!
I'm coming down!

189
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:05,031
O glorious call of the sun!

190
00:24:25,964 --> 00:24:28,194
I'll take this one.

191
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:35,537
if you please,
at this extraordinary potato:

192
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:40,740
this swelling, luxuriant flesh,
forever...

193
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:43,304
conceiving new shapes...

194
00:24:43,582 --> 00:24:46,517
and yet so chaste.

195
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,084
I love a potato...

196
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,155
because it speaks to me.

197
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:56,024
The spuds are
bigger this year than last.

198
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:57,892
What are you doing?

199
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,628
Oskar learn to write.

200
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:05,496
Stop that.
You'll never learn to write...

201
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:11,008
and read the great classics,
the eternal truths:

202
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,839
''Die unto life!''

203
00:25:31,129 --> 00:25:33,927
Hold it.
Now I've got all of you.

204
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:36,564
A bit more to the right, Alex.

205
00:25:36,601 --> 00:25:39,229
For you on your first day of school.

206
00:25:39,337 --> 00:25:41,066
Eyes this way, please.

207
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:54,382
My name is Spollenhauer,
and I am your teacher.

208
00:25:54,452 --> 00:25:55,578
Be seated.

209
00:25:56,988 --> 00:26:00,253
And now, dear children,
do any of you know a song?

210
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:06,393
You must be little Oskar.

211
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,398
We've heard so much about you!

212
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,262
How well you play!

213
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:13,635
Isn't our Oskar a fine drummer?.

214
00:26:15,473 --> 00:26:18,203
But now we'll put the drum away.

215
00:26:18,643 --> 00:26:21,476
It must be sleepy.

216
00:26:22,614 --> 00:26:26,778
After school,
you can have it back again.

217
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,716
You're a naughty Oskar.

218
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,524
I will now read you the program.

219
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:43,233
Monday: Writing,
Arithmetic, Reading...

220
00:26:43,301 --> 00:26:44,791
Religion.

221
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:48,361
All together: Writing!

222
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,200
Arith-me-tic!

223
00:26:51,676 --> 00:26:53,644
Oskar, stop that!

224
00:26:54,245 --> 00:26:55,610
Religion.

225
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:16,365
Get out!

226
00:27:20,772 --> 00:27:24,299
Strange!
Very strange!

227
00:27:24,342 --> 00:27:26,936
How old is he, did you say?

228
00:27:26,978 --> 00:27:28,445
Six, Doctor.

229
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,005
Inge, kindly undress Oskar.

230
00:27:31,549 --> 00:27:35,212
How long is it since
he fell down the stairs?

231
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:37,846
Three years on September 12.

232
00:27:37,889 --> 00:27:40,449
We'd better examine
the spine again.

233
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:44,326
Be a good boy.
I'll give it right back.

234
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:47,824
Oskar, give me your
drum. I'll hold it.

235
00:27:47,899 --> 00:27:51,198
See, you can't get
out of your shirt.

236
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:55,735
Oskar, if you're not good,
the doctor won't make you well.

237
00:27:55,774 --> 00:28:00,006
Come, child.
Give me your drum!

238
00:28:28,473 --> 00:28:32,466
Amazing! Amazing!

239
00:28:37,115 --> 00:28:39,310
I shall write a paper...

240
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,047
about it for one
of our medical journals...

241
00:28:43,121 --> 00:28:45,851
if you have no objection.

242
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:03,306
The destructive force
of this local phenomenon...

243
00:29:03,808 --> 00:29:07,175
...is such as to suggest...

244
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:12,081
an anomalous formation
of the lower larynx...

245
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:16,620
in little Oskar Matzerath.

246
00:29:16,688 --> 00:29:21,716
Not can we exclude
the hypothesis...

247
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,856
of a concomitant development
of the vocal cords.

248
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,263
Did you hear that?
In a medical journal!

249
00:29:29,334 --> 00:29:32,167
Does the doctor say
why he won't grow?

250
00:29:32,804 --> 00:29:34,965
You'll have to ask him that.

251
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,005
Why he won't grow.

252
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:39,339
Cut it out!

253
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:42,404
He's yours as much as mine.

254
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:43,875
If not more.

255
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:46,382
Who left the trap open,
you or me?

256
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:07,332
Uncle Hailandt,
come spit in the soup.

257
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:11,433
Look what I found in the pond!
Two frogs!

258
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:25,822
What are you doing,
Tom Thumb?

259
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,336
Make Oskar taste the soup!

260
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:09,958
Now it's your turn.

261
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:12,162
You'll love it.

262
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,132
A treat!

263
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,695
Open your mouth!

264
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:22,910
Good, huh?

265
00:31:23,114 --> 00:31:25,844
Just a little more!

266
00:31:58,283 --> 00:32:02,083
Labesweg and its backyards
hemmed me in.

267
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:07,418
I longed for space and
took every opportunity...

268
00:32:07,458 --> 00:32:10,985
to escape the persecutions
of the soup cooks...

269
00:32:11,029 --> 00:32:13,725
by going into town...

270
00:32:13,765 --> 00:32:17,132
alone or with Mama.

271
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:17,151
Drum's busted.

272
00:33:18,196 --> 00:33:20,858
Want me to mend it?

273
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,090
He's getting a new one.

274
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,536
Hello, Uncle Jan.

275
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:57,501
Coming?

276
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:04,265
I must leave you now.

277
00:34:05,376 --> 00:34:07,708
A few little errands.

278
00:34:07,945 --> 00:34:09,435
Good-bye, Agnes.

279
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:13,849
This is for your drum, Oskar.

280
00:34:33,671 --> 00:34:35,969
Who do I see?
Oh, Mrs. Matzerath...

281
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,508
and little Oskar, for a new drum?

282
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:41,342
Yes, Mr. Markus. Again.

283
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,108
He's always at it.

284
00:34:43,147 --> 00:34:46,583
I never know what year it
is or what day...

285
00:34:46,617 --> 00:34:49,177
except when you come in.

286
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,882
Something tells me
it must be Thursday again.

287
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:56,485
You have such beautiful hands.

288
00:34:59,030 --> 00:35:03,126
Oskar, see that box?
Hand it to me.

289
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:05,860
That's it.

290
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:10,101
See, Mrs. Matzerath.
Beautiful stockings. Silk!

291
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:13,235
Pure silk. Fine quality!

292
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:17,175
One, two, three pairs.
Take them.

293
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,706
They'll suit you fine.
A bargain!

294
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,445
Much too dear for me!

295
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:24,546
- They're worth it.
- Maybe later.

296
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:27,854
I'll let them go
for half a gulden.

297
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,858
So cheap?

298
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,326
No, Markus, that's
driving them away.

299
00:35:33,397 --> 00:35:36,161
Take them!
Don't ask questions!

300
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:38,265
And now, Oskar...

301
00:35:38,703 --> 00:35:41,194
what would you like?

302
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:44,672
Oh! A new drum we need?

303
00:35:44,842 --> 00:35:49,336
Just choose one.
You know where they are!

304
00:35:49,380 --> 00:35:52,781
See, Oskar?.
He's so happy!

305
00:35:55,186 --> 00:35:58,383
Mr. Markus, could
little Oskar stay...

306
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:00,686
with you for half an hour?.

307
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,256
I have some
important business.

308
00:36:04,295 --> 00:36:07,458
Yes, yes, I'll watch him
like the apple of my eye.

309
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:10,729
Do your important business
and don't worry.

310
00:36:10,768 --> 00:36:13,259
The little prince
will stay with me...

311
00:36:14,038 --> 00:36:16,734
while you do your
important business...

312
00:36:17,375 --> 00:36:19,434
like every Thursday.

313
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:31,353
We're blocking the street!

314
00:41:56,547 --> 00:42:00,950
Danzig has always
been German!

315
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:05,720
If not for the German people...

316
00:42:06,257 --> 00:42:08,987
these eastern regions
would have succumbed...

317
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:11,651
to total barbarism...

318
00:42:35,419 --> 00:42:37,387
Have a nice walk?

319
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:49,625
The Fuhrer's speaking all over!
Except here!

320
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:41,509
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
the smallest of the small:

321
00:43:41,585 --> 00:43:44,679
Bebra and his midgets!

322
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,940
My word!

323
00:45:55,586 --> 00:45:59,215
Now it's three-year-olds
who choose to stop growing.

324
00:46:01,125 --> 00:46:03,252
My name is Bebra.

325
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:09,761
Directly descended
from Prince Eugene...

326
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:15,664
Whose father was Louis XIV...

327
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:19,005
and not some Savoyard,
as has been claimed.

328
00:46:19,810 --> 00:46:25,180
I stopped my growth
on my tenth birthday.

329
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:29,745
Better late than never.

330
00:46:33,257 --> 00:46:35,191
Tell me, my dear Oskar.

331
00:46:35,259 --> 00:46:37,693
How old are you?
Fourteen? Fifteen?

332
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:39,457
Twelve and a half.

333
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:43,023
No! And how old
do you think I am?

334
00:46:44,935 --> 00:46:46,903
Thirty-five.

335
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:50,699
Flatterer!

336
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:57,777
I shall be 53 in August.

337
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:00,043
I could be your grandfather.

338
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:03,618
- Are you, too, an artist?
- Not really.

339
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:05,121
Although...

340
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:19,663
as you see, I can lay
claim to a certain artistry.

341
00:47:25,042 --> 00:47:28,341
You must join us. You must!

342
00:47:28,912 --> 00:47:31,005
Do you know, Mr. Bebra...

343
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:37,649
to tell the truth...

344
00:47:37,988 --> 00:47:41,287
I prefer to be a
member of the audience...

345
00:47:41,358 --> 00:47:45,454
and let my little art
flower in secret.

346
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,493
My dear Oskar!

347
00:47:48,332 --> 00:47:51,631
Trust an experienced colleague.

348
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:55,035
Our kind must never
sit in the audience.

349
00:47:55,072 --> 00:47:58,473
Our kind must perform
and run the show...

350
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,635
or the others will run us.

351
00:48:02,746 --> 00:48:05,044
The others are coming.

352
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:07,346
They will occupy the fairgrounds.

353
00:48:07,451 --> 00:48:11,182
They will stage torchlight parades,
build rostrums...

354
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:12,882
fill the rostrums...

355
00:48:12,956 --> 00:48:17,017
and from those rostrums,
preach our destruction.

356
00:48:22,599 --> 00:48:26,592
They're looking for you, dear friend.
We'll meet again.

357
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,763
We're too little to
lose each other.

358
00:48:59,736 --> 00:49:01,670
They are coming!

359
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:08,360
These damn puttees always slip!

360
00:50:10,874 --> 00:50:12,739
I need boots.

361
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,504
You know they cost way too much.

362
00:50:14,544 --> 00:50:16,705
Or leather gaiters at least.

363
00:50:17,447 --> 00:50:19,278
How do I look?

364
00:50:20,984 --> 00:50:24,886
- Going to the demonstration?
- Yes, at the fairground.

365
00:50:25,489 --> 00:50:27,013
Big show!

366
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,330
Gauleiter Lobsack is speaking.

367
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:38,296
And what a speaker!

368
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:43,362
I'm telling you,
these are historic days.

369
00:50:43,673 --> 00:50:47,040
A man can't stand aside.
Gotta join in.

370
00:50:49,679 --> 00:50:52,739
You should read
the Danzig Sentinel.

371
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,544
Crazy your opting for Poland.

372
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:58,679
I've told you 20 times.

373
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:00,980
I'm a Pole.

374
00:51:01,491 --> 00:51:03,322
Think it over.

375
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,052
Take your umbrella.
It looks like rain.

376
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:09,156
An umbrella with my uniform?

377
00:51:10,934 --> 00:51:15,769
The stew is on, Stir it now and then.
Be done in 20 minutes.

378
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,329
Bite to eat before you go?

379
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:21,970
No time. Duty is duty
and schnaps is schnaps.

380
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:40,957
National comrades...

381
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:44,556
of Danzig and Langfuhr...

382
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:49,362
of Ohra, Schidlitz
and Praust...

383
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:54,867
from the hills
and from the lowlands...

384
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:58,176
I know you all...

385
00:51:58,215 --> 00:52:02,276
cherish but one wish.

386
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:05,553
It has been our heartfelt wish...

387
00:52:06,156 --> 00:52:10,217
ever since a shameful diktat...

388
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:11,557
separated us...

389
00:52:11,595 --> 00:52:15,156
from our beloved
German fatherland.

390
00:52:15,565 --> 00:52:20,195
That wish is: Home to the Reich!

391
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,914
What is the meaning
of this Free State...

392
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,946
that was so generously
foisted on us?

393
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:44,055
It means that our waterfront...

394
00:52:44,094 --> 00:52:46,119
is crawling with Polacks.

395
00:52:46,530 --> 00:52:49,624
And in the middle of
our beloved Old City...

396
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:53,500
they've stuck a
Polish post office--

397
00:52:53,537 --> 00:52:56,165
something we can do without.

398
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:03,005
We Germans had...

399
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,271
post offices...

400
00:53:05,749 --> 00:53:08,809
before the Poles...

401
00:53:09,419 --> 00:53:11,649
even thought of
writing letters.

402
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:14,819
We taught them the alphabet.

403
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,118
And now, dear
national comrades...

404
00:53:20,163 --> 00:53:23,189
let us welcome our guest
from the Reich.

405
00:53:26,937 --> 00:53:30,031
Party comrade Albert Forster...

406
00:53:30,073 --> 00:53:34,669
has just arrived on the field.

407
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:26,054
What's going on?
I want to know what's going on!

408
00:55:26,089 --> 00:55:27,920
Block all the exits!

409
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:38,303
Can you catch them
with a clothesline?

410
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:44,079
Real fish or just old shoes?

411
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:48,255
Suppose we take a look?

412
00:58:48,291 --> 00:58:50,122
Maybe something's there!

413
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:11,206
The sack!

414
00:59:43,580 --> 00:59:45,172
Call that fat?

415
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:51,177
You should have seen them...

416
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:53,922
after the battle of Jutland...

417
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:56,558
when we and the English--

418
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,991
See what I mean?

419
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:07,101
After the battle...

420
01:00:10,406 --> 01:00:14,570
they were this thick!

421
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:29,121
He wanted one-fifty...

422
01:00:29,392 --> 01:00:31,383
but I gave him a gulden.

423
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:12,162
Don't expect me
to touch your eels!

424
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:14,669
Don't put on airs.

425
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:17,571
I'll never eat fist again.
Certainly not eels.

426
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:22,169
You've always eaten them,
and you knew where they came from.

427
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:24,070
Quiet!

428
01:01:24,947 --> 01:01:27,415
Stop that drumming!

429
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:30,043
- Leave the child alone!
- And sit down!

430
01:01:30,086 --> 01:01:32,577
Who was to blame?
Who left the trap open?

431
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:36,281
Old stuff. Sit down.

432
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,687
See if they're not delicious.

433
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:42,220
Come on. Dig in.

434
01:01:42,498 --> 01:01:46,059
Fresh eels with dill sauce...

435
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:49,961
a bay leaf and
a twist of lemon peel.

436
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:52,998
Don't make her eat
if she doesn't want to.

437
01:01:53,042 --> 01:01:55,442
- keep out of this.
- Leave her alone.

438
01:01:55,478 --> 01:01:57,469
She'll only vomit.

439
01:01:57,513 --> 01:02:01,574
I paid good money for these
eels. Just try them.

440
01:02:02,251 --> 01:02:07,052
They've been well
cleaned and washed.

441
01:02:09,358 --> 01:02:12,850
No gall. Light, healthy liver.

442
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:14,692
And so fresh!

443
01:02:19,669 --> 01:02:21,694
Oskar! Sit down!

444
01:02:24,006 --> 01:02:25,997
For hours I stand at the stove.

445
01:02:26,075 --> 01:02:29,135
Some people would be very
happy to eat my eels.

446
01:02:58,474 --> 01:03:00,032
I don't know what to do.

447
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:01,736
Alfred, calm down!

448
01:03:01,978 --> 01:03:05,379
I can't talk to her.
And the fish is getting cold.

449
01:03:05,414 --> 01:03:07,382
Women are more sensitive.

450
01:03:08,017 --> 01:03:12,386
You talk to her. if
only she'd calm down.

451
01:05:12,041 --> 01:05:14,703
Shouldn't I warm
them up at least?

452
01:05:50,012 --> 01:05:52,537
Don't do it with Bronski...

453
01:05:53,449 --> 01:05:56,850
who picked the Polish post office.

454
01:05:56,886 --> 01:05:58,877
Don't bet on the Poles.

455
01:05:59,088 --> 01:06:01,921
If you must bet,
bet on the Germans.

456
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:05,191
Sooner or later,
they'll take over.

457
01:06:05,561 --> 01:06:09,156
And then you'll be stuck
with Bronski...

458
01:06:09,198 --> 01:06:10,688
that crazy Pole.

459
01:06:10,733 --> 01:06:14,066
You'll be in trouble.

460
01:06:14,403 --> 01:06:17,770
Why not bet on Matzerath?

461
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:27,281
Or if you'd do me great honor...

462
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:28,806
bet on me...

463
01:06:29,452 --> 01:06:31,352
on Sigismund Markus...

464
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:33,616
that was just baptized.

465
01:06:33,656 --> 01:06:35,715
No, Markus. Please!

466
01:06:35,758 --> 01:06:37,453
We could go to London...

467
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:41,428
like everybody else.

468
01:06:45,668 --> 01:06:47,568
Look. There he is!

469
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:50,672
We'll take him with us to London.

470
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:53,936
He'll live like a prince.

471
01:06:54,910 --> 01:06:57,970
Thank you, Markus,
but it's impossible.

472
01:06:58,014 --> 01:07:00,209
And not because of Bronski.

473
01:07:00,249 --> 01:07:03,685
I'm glad to hear that.

474
01:07:03,719 --> 01:07:05,311
Steer clear of Bronski...

475
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,879
and stick to Matzerath!
