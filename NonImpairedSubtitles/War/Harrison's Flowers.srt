1
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:16,121
If you can't run, you're dead.
You're dead. So you run.

2
00:00:16,328 --> 00:00:20,128
Bullets flying every which way, you
are dodging the exploding shells.

3
00:00:20,332 --> 00:00:24,063
You think, ''Where's God? Where are
all these angels they talk about?''

4
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:26,863
You're thinking about your mother
and you're thinking about...

5
00:00:27,072 --> 00:00:30,564
your home address,
a cigarette, about nonsense.

6
00:00:32,010 --> 00:00:37,414
Our work is about ugliness,
idiocy and human nature.

7
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:40,275
About hatred.

8
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:43,919
So, when you're in a situation when
you think you're going to die...

9
00:00:44,256 --> 00:00:47,657
'cause it's natural to think about
something beautiful in life, right?

10
00:00:48,327 --> 00:00:51,023
There are two types of people
in this world.

11
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:54,795
Those who have been to war,
who have seen war up close...

12
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,161
and those who haven't.

13
00:00:58,303 --> 00:00:59,770
It's not the same animal.

14
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:26,483
<i>Rescue squads arriving on the</i>
<i>scene, watched heplessly</i>...

15
00:02:26,692 --> 00:02:30,093
Cesar, if you don't understand,
you have to ask your teacher.

16
00:02:30,295 --> 00:02:32,593
Yes, but it's hard to.
She's always busy.

17
00:02:32,798 --> 00:02:35,426
You need a lot of courage
to talk to the teacher.

18
00:02:37,302 --> 00:02:40,169
So, are we done yet?

19
00:02:40,372 --> 00:02:44,035
-I'm done.
-Done done, or ''kinda sorta'' done?

20
00:02:44,242 --> 00:02:46,836
Done, done.
What's the surprise?

21
00:02:48,914 --> 00:02:52,475
Daddy?
Is it Daddy?

22
00:02:53,785 --> 00:02:56,618
Daddy! Daddy!

23
00:02:56,822 --> 00:02:59,985
Cesar. Cesar.
Come on, come on.

24
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:03,823
Hi, sweetheart!

25
00:03:09,134 --> 00:03:13,764
I'm sparkling done!

26
00:03:13,972 --> 00:03:17,669
Hey, you little man.
Come here!

27
00:03:18,009 --> 00:03:20,637
It's good to see you!

28
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:23,474
Come on, get your brother!
Get your brother!

29
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:26,781
Let me see you.

30
00:03:34,926 --> 00:03:36,951
Love you!
Have a great day!

31
00:04:03,922 --> 00:04:07,289
-What's happened here, Freddy?
-Nothing. It was last night.

32
00:04:07,726 --> 00:04:10,661
They robbed the register.
The fourth time.

33
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,293
-What will it be? Juice oranges?
-Were they armed?

34
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:19,596
A pretty lady like you doesn't have
to worry about things like that.

35

...<i>People's Liberation Army has</i>

Harrison!

43
00:05:52,664 --> 00:05:54,325
Harrison?

44
00:06:07,112 --> 00:06:08,602
Harrison?

45
00:06:09,381 --> 00:06:10,780
Sweetheart.

46
00:06:11,016 --> 00:06:12,506
-Hi.
-Hi.

47
00:06:17,722 --> 00:06:19,553
Oh, God, that's good.

48
00:06:24,596 --> 00:06:27,087
-I'm going to be late.
-No, no. Don't worry.

49
00:06:27,299 --> 00:06:30,427
I'll make out right with Brubeck.
He knows how it is.

50
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:33,263
Don't you dare say
anything to Bru...

51
00:07:00,198 --> 00:07:01,961
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

52
00:07:02,434 --> 00:07:04,026
Good morning!

53
00:07:13,178 --> 00:07:15,009
-Good morning.
-Good morning!

54
00:07:16,548 --> 00:07:19,346
God! You look exhausted.

55
00:07:20,986 --> 00:07:23,147
No really, you got the flu?

56
00:07:26,524 --> 00:07:28,651
Gotta a problem this morning?

57
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:33,397
Excuse me.

58
00:07:38,903 --> 00:07:42,168
Oh, my God, you look terrible.
Are you coming down with something?

59
00:07:42,374 --> 00:07:44,934
You look awful,
maybe you should've called in sick!

60
00:07:45,143 --> 00:07:48,078
How are you doing?
Did Harrison get back to you?

61
00:07:48,279 --> 00:07:50,213
Give me a break!

62
00:07:51,916 --> 00:07:54,248
I had to get out there.
That world wasn't for me.

63
00:07:54,452 --> 00:07:57,785
I came back here to the farm
and I got no regrets.

64
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:02,020
<i>l liked Harrison</i>.
<i>He always wrapped a note for her</i>...

65
00:08:02,227 --> 00:08:07,062
<i>around his film boxes. Beautiful stuff</i>,
<i>l wish l could write like that</i>.

66
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:09,961
From South Sudan, fresh off
the plane. Shot two days ago.

67
00:08:10,168 --> 00:08:13,604
He once wrote, ''They're all insane''.

68
00:08:14,072 --> 00:08:16,472
And I thought,
''This guy is freaking out!''

69
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:21,539
<i>l always ate at this Jewish</i>
<i>restaurant, Katsman's Deli</i>.

70
00:08:21,746 --> 00:08:23,771
<i>Harrison ate there all the time</i>.

71
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:27,315
<i>l heard it all. Brubeck can say</i>
<i>whatever he likes, l heard it</i>.

72
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,510
-Margaux, Sam.
-Margaux.

73
00:08:29,888 --> 00:08:33,415
Just 'had' to recite her
multiplication tables. Twos.

74
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,253
I had fifteen phones ringing off
the hook and she's there...

75
00:08:36,461 --> 00:08:39,430
''One times two is two,
two times two is four.''

76
00:08:39,631 --> 00:08:42,031
You've made some progress
in Math, Sam!

77
00:08:42,734 --> 00:08:46,170
David's pictures aren't bad.
Take a peek when you get upstairs.

78
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:50,668
A little lacking in the impact
department, as usual, but not bad.

79
00:08:51,476 --> 00:08:53,967
-Want a beer?
-No.

80
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:58,382
-I'm giving it up, Sam.
-What, beer?

81
00:08:59,084 --> 00:09:00,915
That's why I wanted to see you.

82
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,578
Right away?

83
00:09:04,355 --> 00:09:05,913
Why?

84
00:09:06,124 --> 00:09:07,751
You'd be bored shitless, Harrison.

85
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:10,860
-You gave it up.
-I didn't have your talent.

86
00:09:11,296 --> 00:09:15,733
-Why now?
-Sam, my luck bank is down to zero.

87
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:19,898
Never used to get clammy hands with
guys going at each other around me.

88
00:09:20,105 --> 00:09:24,838
I took my pictures clear-headed,
even when I was up to neck in shit.

89
00:09:25,143 --> 00:09:29,239
And I was proud. The more it stank,
the more dangerous it was...

90
00:09:29,447 --> 00:09:33,247
I was proud to expose it. I was
conscious of doing my job right.

91
00:09:34,586 --> 00:09:37,282
-I wasn't afraid of anything.
-So?

92
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:40,322
Sam, all I can think about now is
Sarah and the kids.

93
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:43,684
-And I'm sick of it.
-Yes, I'm sick of it, too.

94
00:09:44,028 --> 00:09:47,862
What the hell do you think?
Every damn day I'm sick of it.

95
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,891
But we can't just drop it.
You can't and I can't.

96
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,166
There is a magazine,
for Christ sake...

97
00:09:55,373 --> 00:09:58,001
Look.
Hang on a while.

98
00:09:58,443 --> 00:10:02,072
Just a little while.
Give me time to get organized.

99
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:05,110
Then I'll find you something safe,
cushy and overpaid.

100
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:12,353
Okay, Sam.
I'll stick it out for a while.

101
00:10:12,690 --> 00:10:16,717
But this is just for you. And
I'm warning you it's not for long.

102
00:10:17,295 --> 00:10:19,763
No, no. Not for long.
Not for long.

103
00:10:20,465 --> 00:10:22,262
Anyway,
you're under contract, remember?

104
00:10:24,135 --> 00:10:26,000
You really are a bastard!

105
00:10:28,573 --> 00:10:31,474
-Daddy, watch this!
-Watch what?

106
00:10:31,676 --> 00:10:34,668
-My submarine, please, just once!
-I'm going to be late, pumpkin.

107
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,847
I'm going to be late.
I can't, I'm sorry.

108
00:10:37,048 --> 00:10:40,814
-Please, daddy, please just once!
-Just once. Just once.

109
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:43,146
Please!

110
00:10:43,354 --> 00:10:45,322
What are you going to do?

111
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,225
Where did you go?
Come here!

112
00:10:49,427 --> 00:10:52,294
You are the best submarine
in the whole world.

113
00:11:02,273 --> 00:11:04,400
-What's the matter?
-Nothing.

114
00:11:11,716 --> 00:11:14,776
-What is it, Harrison?
-Nothing.

115
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:16,783
Just Cesar.

116
00:11:17,722 --> 00:11:20,156
I don't know. I can't...

117
00:11:21,426 --> 00:11:24,190
Every time I start talking to him
and he clams up.

118
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:27,125
-I can't figure out why.
-Because you're always away.

119
00:11:27,332 --> 00:11:29,596
-He's not used to having you...
-What's that supposed mean?

120
00:11:29,801 --> 00:11:32,770
Nothing. I want us to have a good
time tonight. I don't want...

121
00:11:32,971 --> 00:11:35,098
No, tell me. What does that mean?
What does that mean?!

122
00:11:35,306 --> 00:11:40,903
-If you showed a little interest...
-Shit! I show interest in him...

123
00:11:41,112 --> 00:11:44,980
in you! In Margaux!
How do you think I spend my time?

124
00:11:45,183 --> 00:11:47,947
Sarah, shit!
Why do you think I do what I do?

125
00:11:48,152 --> 00:11:50,086
For who? It's...

126
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:53,090
-Oh, shit!
-Saying ''shit'' forty times...

127
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:57,318
isn't going to help you with your
relationship with your son. Shit!

128
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:17,615
This student, alone...

129
00:12:17,815 --> 00:12:20,784
has become the symbol for
the forces of freedom...

130
00:12:20,985 --> 00:12:23,920
facing the forces of tyranny.

131
00:12:25,323 --> 00:12:28,486
Television stations from all over
the world covered this event...

132
00:12:28,693 --> 00:12:33,392
but is this image,
this single photography...

133
00:12:34,198 --> 00:12:39,397
which has become synonymous with
the drama of that historic moment.

134
00:12:40,938 --> 00:12:45,272
Yeager Pollack was the man who
captured that magic moment for us.

135
00:12:45,476 --> 00:12:47,376
Wait for it.

136
00:12:48,346 --> 00:12:50,177
Wait for it!

137
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,551
And here tonight,
to introduce him...

138
00:12:54,752 --> 00:13:00,816
his friend and colleague,
Pulitzer Prize winner himself, 1 989...

139
00:13:01,259 --> 00:13:05,389
Newsweek's Harrison Lloyd.

140
00:13:24,549 --> 00:13:29,680
There are very few things that we
can be absolutely certain of...

141
00:13:29,887 --> 00:13:32,617
and never call into question...

142
00:13:32,890 --> 00:13:35,484
no matter how many lives
we live.

143
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:40,455
And it is my pleasure,
my supreme pleasure...

144
00:13:41,432 --> 00:13:43,798
my honor, and...

145
00:13:45,636 --> 00:13:48,799
to share one of those certainties
with you tonight:

146
00:13:49,006 --> 00:13:53,670
and that is that Yeager Pollack
is the best among us.

147
00:14:13,131 --> 00:14:14,860
Hey, buddy.

148
00:14:15,066 --> 00:14:17,557
Thank you.
I love your shoes.

149
00:14:29,981 --> 00:14:31,812
Thank you, thank you.

150
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:38,118
I've made a lot of mistakes...

151
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:42,792
in my life, but I think
the biggest mistake I've made...

152
00:14:42,994 --> 00:14:45,724
was being born in he era
of Harrison Lloyd.

153
00:14:47,999 --> 00:14:49,626
Look up!

154
00:14:50,902 --> 00:14:53,996
All my life, we've been in constant
competition...

155
00:14:54,238 --> 00:14:59,505
over just about everything. So when
I heard that he got this prize...

156
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:03,202
I said to myself,
''I got to get this too.'' So...

157
00:15:07,018 --> 00:15:10,784
but seriously, I...
this prize means a lot to me...

158
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,820
because he gave it to me.

159
00:15:16,661 --> 00:15:19,129
And that his work taught me that...

160
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:23,526
photographs can prize the
communal memory of our time...

161
00:15:24,135 --> 00:15:25,568
And...

162
00:15:27,071 --> 00:15:28,868
I go by that.

163
00:15:29,574 --> 00:15:33,135
Thank you very much.
It's a gift that his work...

164
00:15:34,879 --> 00:15:36,744
Thank you.

165
00:15:43,187 --> 00:15:45,951
We divorced about two
or three years later.

166
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:52,194
Yeager wasn't made for marriage.
He was made to do his job.

167
00:15:53,698 --> 00:15:57,930
No, I mean... it was no secret.
He was in love with Sarah.

168
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:03,807
<i>That's why it was so strange</i>,
<i>because Harrison was his friend</i>.

169
00:16:04,408 --> 00:16:06,467
<i>His one friend</i>.

170
00:16:07,278 --> 00:16:09,576
<i>And when Sarah</i>
<i>went through all that stuff</i>...

171
00:16:10,448 --> 00:16:12,712
<i>he proved that!</i>

172
00:16:14,385 --> 00:16:15,875
Yeah.

173
00:16:16,687 --> 00:16:20,589
Yeah, I think somewhere Yeager
wanted Harrison dead.

174
00:16:20,791 --> 00:16:23,658
-I heard your voice up there...
-Excuse me, I've got to take a leak.

175
00:16:23,861 --> 00:16:26,659
No, no. Wait a second...

176
00:16:27,031 --> 00:16:28,999
-He's taking off.
-Darling, you have nice ears.

177
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:34,502
We're having a little get together
for Yeager at Katzman's...

178
00:16:34,705 --> 00:16:38,163
...and I'd love for you to come.
-I don't think I could make it.

179
00:16:38,643 --> 00:16:42,875
I'm counting on you, even though
you don't like old war stories.

180
00:16:44,215 --> 00:16:46,046
Thanks, Sarah.

181
00:16:56,561 --> 00:16:59,223
-Nice speech, Harrison.
-Thank you, sir.

182
00:17:03,467 --> 00:17:05,230
Nice speech.

183
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:10,700
''Do you know how many guys
died in Bogota..

184
00:17:10,908 --> 00:17:13,376
so you could powder
you nose, Kyle?''

185
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:16,980
Did I say anything?

186
00:17:17,315 --> 00:17:19,613
Not anything.

187
00:17:21,586 --> 00:17:24,214
I know a guy who died, Lloyd.

188
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,024
Yesterday.

189
00:17:32,964 --> 00:17:36,422
My friend Leroy got bumped off
in Yugoslavia.

190
00:17:36,634 --> 00:17:38,431
I know, I heard.

191
00:17:40,104 --> 00:17:43,130
And no one gives a shit
about that, right?

192
00:17:44,909 --> 00:17:49,846
'Cause Leroy was a tiny
little photographer...

193
00:17:50,448 --> 00:17:51,938
Tiny.

194
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:56,215
In a tiny little country,
taking pictures of a tiny little war.

195
00:17:57,288 --> 00:18:00,883
You, you're up there...

196
00:18:01,926 --> 00:18:04,451
you're fancy, you and the others.

197
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,767
Life, Time, Newsweek.

198
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,005
You guys, you travel first class...

199
00:18:18,209 --> 00:18:20,302
with twenty-five cameras...

200
00:18:20,511 --> 00:18:23,378
and your fancy little
hotel rooms...

201
00:18:25,316 --> 00:18:29,377
and then you give
each other prizes.

202
00:18:30,388 --> 00:18:33,152
Don't fucking touch me!
Don't touch me.

203
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,828
Leroy was twenty-five, Harrison.
He was broke.

204
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:42,766
Remember what that's like?

205
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:44,935
-I do.
-You do?

206
00:18:45,136 --> 00:18:50,506
Yet no one gave him an assignment.
So he spent his own money...

207
00:18:50,808 --> 00:18:54,403
he put everything he had into
making something for himself...

208
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:57,612
and still no one would use
his fucking pictures...

209
00:18:57,815 --> 00:19:01,182
and now he's fucking dead
on his own nickel!

210
00:19:01,552 --> 00:19:04,112
-I'm sorry, Kyle...
-Yeah, you're sorry...

211
00:19:04,321 --> 00:19:08,815
...but it happens, okay?
So just calm down, all right?

212
00:19:10,561 --> 00:19:12,654
-Go fuck yourself!
-Come on...

213
00:19:13,164 --> 00:19:15,098
Fuck!

214
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,968
Hey, you want to get funny?

215
00:19:18,269 --> 00:19:22,069
-You wanna get funny?
-Yeager.

216
00:19:22,273 --> 00:19:24,173
I'll fucking break your leg,
come on!

217
00:20:34,178 --> 00:20:37,113
<i>lt's so heavy!</i>

218
00:20:38,749 --> 00:20:42,116
<i>l know. lt's so good!</i>

219
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:47,287
-Harrison?
-Sarah, look. Come here!

220
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,888
Look at this.

221
00:20:50,594 --> 00:20:54,030
Now I know why the only thing
I can shoot in color are flowers.

222
00:20:54,231 --> 00:20:58,190
-And you, of course.
-You must want something.

223
00:20:59,503 --> 00:21:01,562
-Is that from Peter?
-Yep.

224
00:21:02,206 --> 00:21:04,902
Your brother's
a hypocritical son of a bitch.

225
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:08,875
Going around picking flowers
while people kill each other...

226
00:21:09,079 --> 00:21:11,775
-He should be ashamed of himself.
-He doesn't pick... he saves them.

227
00:21:11,982 --> 00:21:14,143
-And he gets paid good money for it.
-I know.

228
00:21:14,351 --> 00:21:18,515
And the St. Louis Botanical Gardens
is a waste of the taxpayer's money.

229
00:21:18,722 --> 00:21:20,713
I'm kidding.

230
00:21:20,925 --> 00:21:23,894
Your brother's a very wise
man and I envy him.

231
00:21:24,728 --> 00:21:26,059
So what is it?

232
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:29,721
''Catharanthus roseus''.
Madagascar pink periwinkle.

233
00:21:29,934 --> 00:21:33,392
Never seen one of these before.
It has some therapeutic uses...

234
00:21:33,604 --> 00:21:36,300
cures certain forms of
infantile leukemia.

235
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:39,941
It's beautiful and a lifesaver.
Just like you.

236
00:21:44,181 --> 00:21:46,775
I was trying to be clever.

237
00:21:47,117 --> 00:21:49,085
-What's the matter?
-No, nothing, nothing. Just...

238
00:21:49,820 --> 00:21:51,811
It's so heavy!

239
00:21:52,022 --> 00:21:54,354
It's so heavy!

240
00:21:56,327 --> 00:22:00,559
Shit! Brubeck has been looking out
for you. Sorry, I completely forgot.

241
00:22:25,256 --> 00:22:26,917
Sam! What's up?

242
00:22:31,896 --> 00:22:34,228
Zagreb, and then...

243
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,591
Where is it? North?
I got it, I got it.

244
00:22:41,038 --> 00:22:42,733
What's happening in Yugoslavia?

245
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,568
Civil war, it's nothing
earth-shattering.

246
00:22:46,744 --> 00:22:49,338
No TV crews, even on CNN,
they don't have anything.

247
00:22:49,546 --> 00:22:52,538
Brubeck wants me to go there
for the international edition.

248
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:57,653
Just about a week. You know,
Time is sending somebody.

249
00:22:57,855 --> 00:23:00,517
Sweetheart, can you give me
that map there on the couch?

250
00:23:04,828 --> 00:23:06,989
Yeager's furious he can't go.

251
00:23:07,298 --> 00:23:10,927
He has to have his knee operated on.
Hope it's nothing serious.

252
00:23:12,036 --> 00:23:14,800
-You'll look in on him, right?
-Sure.

253
00:23:15,005 --> 00:23:17,132
-Promise?
-Promise.

254
00:23:20,878 --> 00:23:23,176
Graz. G-R-A-Z.

255
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:26,110
Make sure there's
an airport there, okay?

256
00:23:26,684 --> 00:23:28,652
Yes, master.

257
00:23:31,488 --> 00:23:33,888
Cesar is going to be
so disappointed.

258
00:23:34,124 --> 00:23:37,924
I promised him you'd be home for
his birthday. You will, won't you?

259
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:44,894
Hi, Lisa. It's Sarah Lloyd,
I'm calling for Harrison.

260
00:23:46,303 --> 00:23:51,070
Yes, he needs a ticket for Graz.
G-R-A-Z.

261
00:23:52,109 --> 00:23:54,873
Yes, I think they have
an airport.

262
00:23:56,246 --> 00:23:58,510
It's in Australia.
Nope.

263
00:23:59,516 --> 00:24:01,006
Austria!

264
00:24:01,385 --> 00:24:02,943
Austria.

265
00:24:09,927 --> 00:24:11,861
She loves me.

266
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:15,589
-She loves me not.
-So what time? 2:45 PM.

267
00:24:15,799 --> 00:24:18,495
Lay over in Zurich. Mom's in Zurich.
You have lunch with her.

268
00:24:18,702 --> 00:24:22,502
-She loves me not.
-Okay, thank you.

269
00:25:42,186 --> 00:25:44,086
Good morning, Lisa.

270
00:25:45,622 --> 00:25:47,556
Nice hat, Sarah.

271
00:25:49,593 --> 00:25:52,562
Thank you. Thank you.

272
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,434
I'm going to get some coffee.
Do you want some?

273
00:25:58,635 --> 00:26:02,799
Yes, decaf. Skinny! Foam!
Vanilla! The works!

274
00:26:13,183 --> 00:26:16,584
-He pulled the trigger.
-No, he just wanted to scare her.

275
00:26:16,787 --> 00:26:19,017
Scare an old woman?
What for?

276
00:26:19,223 --> 00:26:23,353
Harrison's using a 1 35. Odds are the
guy never saw him take the picture.

277
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,585
I'm sure he pulled the trigger.

278
00:26:25,796 --> 00:26:27,286
Fuck!

279
00:26:42,479 --> 00:26:44,572
<i>There is no price</i>...

280
00:26:44,781 --> 00:26:46,510
<i>and no force powerful</i>
<i>enough</i>...

281
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:52,785

-First footage out of Yugoslavia.

282
00:26:53,957 --> 00:26:59,020

-Gonna be another Beirut.
-You can't tell.

285
00:27:06,703 --> 00:27:10,104
All we have is Croatian TV.
It's confusing.

286
00:27:10,307 --> 00:27:12,468
Rival militias settling
old scores.

287
00:27:12,676 --> 00:27:14,644
Add a pinch of religion,
cover and let simmer...

288
00:27:14,845 --> 00:27:18,281
...you got yourself a messy war.
-Could spread a full-scale war.

289
00:27:18,482 --> 00:27:21,610
-No, it's just a...
-What? A police action?

290
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:24,844
No. Just ethnic skirmishes.

291
00:27:25,088 --> 00:27:28,524
The Europeans haven't moved and
it's right in their own backyard.

292
00:27:28,725 --> 00:27:30,818
They know what they're doing,
don't they?

293
00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:33,056
Well...

294
00:27:34,932 --> 00:27:37,992
-What's this?
-Pictures of ''ethnic skirmishes''.

295

00:29:08,292 --> 00:29:09,850
Hello.

308
00:29:10,427 --> 00:29:13,863
Harrison? Harrison?

309
00:29:14,531 --> 00:29:17,193
I can't hear you.
But you can hear me, right?

310
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:24,006
Yes, I miss you, Harrison Lloyd.
If that's why you're calling.

311
00:29:25,075 --> 00:29:29,910
Actually, all I've done is think
about you for the last few days.

312
00:29:31,048 --> 00:29:35,985
You know, I've had these dreams.
You know, those dreams.

313
00:29:36,687 --> 00:29:40,248
Your hands, your mouth!

314
00:29:43,093 --> 00:29:46,028
It's very frustrating, you know!

315
00:29:47,597 --> 00:29:50,623
You're laughing at me.

316
00:29:55,138 --> 00:29:58,904
You know,
I've thought about it, Harrison...

317
00:30:00,477 --> 00:30:03,207
when I turn on the TV
I wish I could watch CNN...

318
00:30:03,413 --> 00:30:06,246
and feel like it doesn't affect
me personally.

319
00:30:07,584 --> 00:30:10,246
You can hear me, I hope.

320
00:30:11,221 --> 00:30:14,850
You know? You could...

321
00:30:15,959 --> 00:30:17,756
Hello?

322
00:30:18,929 --> 00:30:20,726
Hello?

323
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:37,840
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

324
00:30:58,602 --> 00:31:00,194
Good morning.

325
00:31:21,024 --> 00:31:23,288
-Is there anything for me, Lisa?
-Nothing.

326
00:32:20,484 --> 00:32:21,883
Sarah.

327
00:32:24,421 --> 00:32:26,048
Sarah...

328
00:32:30,393 --> 00:32:32,327
Sarah, wait.

329
00:32:33,730 --> 00:32:35,721
Sarah, please.

330
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:37,964
Sarah, I must..

331
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:42,262
Sarah!

332
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:52,781
-Sarah, sweetheart!
-Don't say it.

333
00:32:53,517 --> 00:32:55,348
Please. Just...

334
00:32:56,152 --> 00:32:57,710
don't say it.

335
00:33:00,357 --> 00:33:03,224
The Red Cross sent word yesterday.

336
00:33:03,894 --> 00:33:08,388
We were waiting to be sure
before we told you.

337
00:33:08,598 --> 00:33:11,066
ZDF confirmed.

338
00:33:14,137 --> 00:33:17,004
They lost a cameraman
and a reporter too.

339
00:33:17,774 --> 00:33:21,005
Drink this, it'll do you good.

340
00:33:22,445 --> 00:33:24,310
Where?

341
00:33:24,915 --> 00:33:28,783
Some small town.
I don't know.

342
00:33:33,189 --> 00:33:35,657
Near Osijek.

343
00:33:38,395 --> 00:33:40,625
When do they bring his body back?

344
00:33:41,231 --> 00:33:44,166
Well, it won't be right away.

345
00:33:49,272 --> 00:33:51,763
They won't bring him back.

346
00:33:53,843 --> 00:33:59,110
He was...
in this house and it collapsed.

347
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:05,717
And they buried everyone right away
to protect against epidemics.

348
00:34:11,294 --> 00:34:15,424
They're sending his backpack
with some of his cameras.

349
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:20,994
He went light,
dropped most of his gear off...

350
00:34:21,204 --> 00:34:23,729
with one of our guys in Zagreb.

351
00:34:30,013 --> 00:34:33,346
I won't see him again?

352
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:36,747
I won't see him...

353
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:41,486
It's a filthy fucking war, Sarah.

354
00:34:41,891 --> 00:34:44,985
Just like all the other
filthy fucking wars.

355
00:34:45,862 --> 00:34:47,887
We were wrong.

356
00:34:48,398 --> 00:34:51,094
It's not just skirmishes.

357
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:53,966
We were all wrong.

358
00:35:04,614 --> 00:35:08,448
I'll take you home.
Sarah, I'll take you home.

359
00:35:10,186 --> 00:35:13,986
I'll take you home.
Come on, I'm taking you home.

360
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:16,925
Sarah.

361
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:32,099
She made me promise I wouldn't say
anything to the children.

362
00:35:32,509 --> 00:35:35,535
She said that one thing and
then she didn't talk.

363
00:35:35,979 --> 00:35:40,245
<i>Yes, it was</i>
<i>the Wednesday after, l think</i>.

364
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,577
<i>Her mother came up</i>
<i>from Washington</i>.

365
00:35:42,786 --> 00:35:44,515
<i>lt was in the morning</i>.

366
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,618
<i>Mr. Brubeck was real worried</i>.
<i>He told her</i>...

367
00:36:13,183 --> 00:36:15,344
Sarah, darling!

368
00:36:18,455 --> 00:36:22,255
<i>She never would cry, and she didn't</i>
<i>want anybody else to cry either</i>.

369
00:36:23,793 --> 00:36:26,353
<i>That's Sarah</i>.
<i>That's just the way she is</i>.

370
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:32,091
Then, a few days later, they came
with the bags, Mr. Lloyd's bags.

371
00:36:34,337 --> 00:36:37,534
<i>Thank God the kids were in school</i>
<i>that day, because that was</i>...

372
00:36:52,589 --> 00:36:55,422
Sarah! Sarah!

373
00:37:10,607 --> 00:37:13,474
<i>Sarah, please</i>.
<i>Open this door</i>.

374
00:37:14,944 --> 00:37:17,674
<i>Sarah, you must get hold</i>
<i>of yourself!</i>

375
00:37:21,551 --> 00:37:23,018
Sarah!

376
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:55,413
Sarah!

377
00:38:59,515 --> 00:39:02,746
<i>CNN Weekend continues with</i>
<i>our top story</i>...

378
00:39:02,952 --> 00:39:04,886
<i>a story of immeasurable importance</i>.

379
00:39:05,088 --> 00:39:09,457
<i>Serbian troops are moving through</i>
<i>taking one city after another</i>.

<i>Refugees abound, leading toward</i>

381

<i>After several days of resistance</i>
<i>the village of</i>...

382
00:39:18,935 --> 00:39:22,496
<i>An estimated 1 00 prisoners</i>
<i>were captured by the Serbs</i>...

383
00:39:22,705 --> 00:39:26,163
<i>who may now use them in</i>
<i>exchange with the Croatians</i>.

384
00:39:26,542 --> 00:39:30,808
<i>The important question remains</i>
<i>however for the Serbs to answer</i>.

385
00:39:31,014 --> 00:39:33,539
<i>What has become of</i>
<i>the seven thousand inhabitants?</i>

386
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,929
What is this?

387
00:40:26,135 --> 00:40:29,127
What are you doing?
What are you doing here?

388
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:32,103
-Saying Kaddish, Sarah.
-But no one is dead.

389
00:40:32,308 --> 00:40:35,300
There's no reason for this.
Where are my children?

390
00:40:35,511 --> 00:40:38,810
Sarah. Sarah, we need closure!

391
00:40:39,015 --> 00:40:43,042
Get your hands off of me!
No one is dead!

392
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:49,720
He's not dead, Peter! Okay?
Would you just tell them to leave?

393
00:40:49,926 --> 00:40:52,087
He's not dead.

394
00:40:55,331 --> 00:40:56,855
Sarah?

395
00:40:57,066 --> 00:41:00,524
I'm going to take Cesar and Margaux
with me to St. Louis tomorrow.

396
00:41:00,737 --> 00:41:02,329
They'll be...

397
00:41:03,806 --> 00:41:05,637
They'll be with their cousins.

398
00:41:05,842 --> 00:41:09,175
I think they'll be better off.
Is that all right with you?

399
00:41:11,114 --> 00:41:13,139
Hi, Peter.

400
00:41:13,383 --> 00:41:14,816
Hi, you.

401
00:41:18,287 --> 00:41:20,084
Nina will stay here.

402
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:24,658
Mom wants to stay, too.
If she bothers, you give me a call.

403
00:41:33,903 --> 00:41:38,465
Something would've broken inside
if he were dead.

404
00:41:38,674 --> 00:41:42,610
It's not possible otherwise.
Do you understand, Peter?

405
00:41:45,948 --> 00:41:48,280
Yes, you understand.

406
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:54,056
Do what you have to do.
Take your time.

407
00:41:54,657 --> 00:41:56,818
When you decide...

408
00:41:57,794 --> 00:42:01,423
I'll bring the kids back or you
can come to Saint Louis, all right?

409
00:42:01,864 --> 00:42:03,695
Thank you.

410
00:42:08,638 --> 00:42:10,299
Sarah.

411
00:42:11,541 --> 00:42:14,169
You have two beautiful children.

417
00:42:36,699 --> 00:42:40,032

<i>Why Vukovar?</i>

00:47:22,952 --> 00:47:25,580
-You are a journalist?
-No.

461
00:47:25,988 --> 00:47:29,219
-You not going to Yugoslavia, yes?
-No.

462
00:47:29,425 --> 00:47:30,824
Where are you going?

463
00:47:31,026 --> 00:47:33,654
-I have business in Graz.
-Fine.

464
00:47:33,863 --> 00:47:35,956
Because we had cars returned
with holes in them.

465
00:47:36,165 --> 00:47:38,861
-One gave us just the keys back.
-No kidding.

466
00:47:39,068 --> 00:47:41,366
Here, the car is outside.
There.

467
00:47:41,871 --> 00:47:44,032
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

468
00:47:58,921 --> 00:48:02,186
-Sorry, can you bring me?
-You going to Graz?

469
00:48:02,391 --> 00:48:06,054
No, bring me where you go.
Please. Please.

470
00:48:06,262 --> 00:48:08,822
-I don't understand.
-You go where?

471
00:48:09,265 --> 00:48:11,233
Go where?

472
00:48:11,434 --> 00:48:13,800
-To Vukovar.
-I know road.

473
00:48:14,003 --> 00:48:15,937
I show if you bring me.
Please.

474
00:48:16,138 --> 00:48:17,935
I'll help you.
Really, please.

475
00:48:25,648 --> 00:48:29,641
I'm a student in Paris.
But I'm Croatian.

476
00:48:32,188 --> 00:48:35,521
I go to find family.
Wife and baby.

477
00:48:38,227 --> 00:48:40,286
My baby five months.

478
00:48:41,497 --> 00:48:43,897
I have a picture to show you.

479
00:48:47,636 --> 00:48:49,968
-She's beautiful!
-Thank you.

480
00:48:50,539 --> 00:48:54,999
I want bring them with me in France,
in Montpellier.

481
00:48:59,114 --> 00:49:01,810
-Have you children?
-Yes, two.

482
00:49:02,017 --> 00:49:03,951
Cesar and Margaux.

483
00:49:06,255 --> 00:49:07,984
What is it?

484
00:49:09,291 --> 00:49:12,727
Frontier. Always line.

485
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:34,174
Stop! Stop here.
Stop here.

486
00:49:40,723 --> 00:49:41,951
-Okay.
-Should I go?

487
00:49:42,157 --> 00:49:44,182
It think it's okay.

488
00:49:47,029 --> 00:49:51,932
<i>Right smack in the middle of</i>
<i>all that, there she was</i>.

489
00:49:52,134 --> 00:49:57,663
The only soldiers she'd ever seen
were in movies or photographs...

490
00:49:58,941 --> 00:50:00,533
like everybody else, I suppose.

491
00:50:00,743 --> 00:50:05,771
No, she didn't know the first thing
I don't think, not even that...

492
00:50:05,981 --> 00:50:09,712
you could have fighting to
the dead in a certain zone...

493
00:50:09,919 --> 00:50:15,357
and then a few hundred yards down
the road, life goes on as usual.

494
00:50:17,059 --> 00:50:20,028
We go first to Nasice, okay?

495
00:50:20,262 --> 00:50:22,730
We see war situation.

496
00:50:24,733 --> 00:50:26,724
-Your name?
-Sarah.

497
00:50:29,004 --> 00:50:31,404
-Pretty.
-Thank you.

498
00:50:32,408 --> 00:50:34,239
My name is Chtiomac.

499
00:50:34,443 --> 00:50:36,070
-Stomach?
-No.

500
00:50:37,146 --> 00:50:39,910
No stomach.
Chtiomac.

501
00:50:40,983 --> 00:50:44,783
-Thought that's what I said.
-No, you said stomach.

502
00:50:44,987 --> 00:50:47,455
Stomach it's like tummy!

503
00:50:47,923 --> 00:50:51,154
-Say it, ''Chtiomac''.
-Chtiomac.

504
00:50:52,428 --> 00:50:53,986
It's good.

505
00:50:55,698 --> 00:50:58,895
So, what do you study in Paris?

506
00:50:59,101 --> 00:51:01,968
I want to be teacher.
French teacher in Croatia.

507
00:51:09,478 --> 00:51:14,916
Vukovar is very far and dangerous.
We pass Osijek.

508
00:51:24,460 --> 00:51:26,951
Chetniks! Chetniks!
Come on! Come on!

509
00:52:05,934 --> 00:52:08,698
Press! Press!

510
00:52:20,149 --> 00:52:24,279
Please, please.
He's not a soldier. Please!

511
00:52:24,987 --> 00:52:26,386
Please!

512
00:52:51,513 --> 00:52:53,913
Please! Please!

513
00:52:54,483 --> 00:52:56,280
Please!

514
00:52:59,621 --> 00:53:04,251
Please, please, please...

515
00:54:25,741 --> 00:54:28,073
It got nasty out here.

516
00:54:30,479 --> 00:54:32,674
I don't like it here.

517
00:54:33,549 --> 00:54:36,609
Why?
It's so nice and quiet.

518
00:55:05,514 --> 00:55:08,005
Hey, she's alive!

519
00:55:11,787 --> 00:55:14,153
She's lucky,
they didn't have time to rape her.

520
00:55:14,356 --> 00:55:16,654
Come on, come on.

521
00:55:18,827 --> 00:55:23,491
Serbian? Croatian?
Please, say something.

522
00:55:29,104 --> 00:55:32,232
We're going to bring you back
to Osijek, okay?

523
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:37,736
-You understand me?
-They killed him.

524
00:55:37,946 --> 00:55:39,675
They killed him for no reason.

525
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:45,379
English? American?

526
00:55:45,587 --> 00:55:47,077
What are you doing her?

527
00:55:49,458 --> 00:55:52,052
-She's a photographer.
-You're a photographer?

528
00:55:57,666 --> 00:56:03,161
Don't shoot! We're photographers!
Don't shoot!

529
00:56:03,372 --> 00:56:06,603
Please, go! Go!

530
00:56:32,234 --> 00:56:35,169
I was shitting bricks there,
to be honest.

531
00:56:35,904 --> 00:56:38,168
For the first time
in my career really.

532
00:56:38,373 --> 00:56:41,706
I mean, I'd covered
a dozen wars already...

533
00:56:41,910 --> 00:56:43,810
and I like this...

534
00:56:44,012 --> 00:56:47,573
but there, it was... bad.

535
00:56:48,850 --> 00:56:53,913
I saw snipers shooting down kids,
then scratching marks on the wall.

536
00:57:02,831 --> 00:57:05,698
Here we are.
No problem finding a room.

537
00:57:05,901 --> 00:57:08,461
Tourism is not exactly
booming right now.

538
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:11,264
You'll like it here.
River view suite, a cozy bar...

539
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,666
got one star in it.

540
00:57:15,711 --> 00:57:18,305
-Where have you been this evening?
-Went to an opening.

541
00:57:18,513 --> 00:57:20,481
Oh, yeah?
Big production?

542
00:57:20,682 --> 00:57:24,140
Crucified snipers,
corpse compacting, the works.

543
00:57:25,253 --> 00:57:28,586
No bar at that party though.
I'd kill for a fucking drink.

544
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:31,384
-Me too.
-Do you have a beer?

545
00:57:31,593 --> 00:57:34,061
I'll order something for you, Kyle?

546
00:57:37,466 --> 00:57:40,333
Sarah, it's you!

547
00:57:43,605 --> 00:57:45,766
You're out of your fucking mind?

548
00:57:48,410 --> 00:57:50,503
You're out of your fucking mind?

549
00:57:51,113 --> 00:57:53,138
Are you out of your fucking mind!?

550
00:57:54,349 --> 00:57:55,941
-What's the problem?
-You're out of your fucking mind?

551
00:57:56,151 --> 00:57:58,244
You already said that, didn't you?

552
00:57:58,453 --> 00:58:01,388
-Do you know her?
-Where the fuck did you find her?

553
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:03,785
Near her car.
There was another guy with her.

554
00:58:03,992 --> 00:58:07,325
-He's dead.
-Who is she then? Do you know her?

555
00:58:08,463 --> 00:58:11,296
Well, come on.
Who the hell is she already?

556
00:58:13,802 --> 00:58:15,770
Sarah Lloyd.

557
00:58:16,405 --> 00:58:18,430
I'm going to Vukovar.
I'm not going to Zagreb.

558
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:20,801
Not in your wildest
fucking dreams!

559
00:58:21,243 --> 00:58:24,474
Sarah, you can't stay
in this country.

560
00:58:25,380 --> 00:58:27,507
This country is...

561
00:58:28,784 --> 00:58:31,048
No one knows what
this country is!

562
00:58:31,253 --> 00:58:34,051
So you'd better beat it
out of here and fast!

563
00:58:35,357 --> 00:58:39,316
I didn't ask for anybody's help.
I have a press card, just...

564
00:58:39,528 --> 00:58:42,190
They don't give a shit
about press cards...

565
00:58:42,831 --> 00:58:47,097
or white flags, or their
own fucking mothers!

566
00:58:47,335 --> 00:58:52,864
Listen, Serb, Catholic,
Croatian, Orthodox...

567
00:58:53,075 --> 00:58:56,977
there's no bad guys,
there's no good guys.

568
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:01,347
They're going to shoot you first
and then they'll think about it.

569
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,352
This is no place for you.

570
00:59:07,956 --> 00:59:09,924
This is no place for the living,
all right?

571
00:59:10,725 --> 00:59:14,661
-They are fucking insane!
-Calm down, Kyle.

572
00:59:17,399 --> 00:59:19,026
You tell her!

573
00:59:27,209 --> 00:59:29,905
You can't go into Vukovar.

574
00:59:30,112 --> 00:59:34,173
The Serbs control the roads.
They bomb everything.

575
00:59:34,916 --> 00:59:38,374
We can't,
even if we wanted to, we can't.

576
00:59:39,521 --> 00:59:45,482
-And Sarah, Harrison is...
-Harrison is there...

577
00:59:45,694 --> 00:59:47,355
and I'm going to get him.

578
00:59:47,562 --> 00:59:50,725
He called me. After the date
they said he was dead!

579
00:59:50,966 --> 00:59:54,026
And if you could just tell me
where Osijek is...

580
00:59:54,236 --> 00:59:58,673
and Vincovci, Nustar,
and Vukovar...

581
00:59:58,874 --> 01:00:01,536
I'm going to go to the hospital
in Vukovar, and after that...

582
01:00:01,743 --> 01:00:04,940
Excuse me, are you deaf?
Or you're just not listening?

583
01:00:05,147 --> 01:00:09,675
It's impossible. You think you'd
arrive at the airport and call for a taxi?

584
01:00:10,218 --> 01:00:13,745
''Take me to Vukovar, please.''
This is a war we have here.

585
01:00:14,723 --> 01:00:16,691
Real war with real blood...

586
01:00:16,892 --> 01:00:22,023
real death, real bombs,
mines, bullets.

587
01:00:22,297 --> 01:00:25,323
With real pricks who'd love
to cut your stomach out.

588
01:00:26,334 --> 01:00:28,097
War.

589
01:00:28,904 --> 01:00:31,202
Didn't your husband
ever mention it?

590
01:00:37,913 --> 01:00:40,882
Here, here. Take this.
It'll relax you.

591
01:00:41,082 --> 01:00:43,778
-This woman is a lunatic.
-This is a sucker, isn't it?

592
01:00:59,935 --> 01:01:03,837
Everybody up.
Come on, we've got work to do.

593
01:01:04,039 --> 01:01:07,099
No, it's across the street,
the Croatian TV building.

594
01:01:07,309 --> 01:01:09,869
Who gives what they're shelling?
They're shelling! Let's go!

595
01:01:18,486 --> 01:01:20,579
They're behind us!
Behind us.

596
01:01:20,789 --> 01:01:23,485
On the other side of the river.
Look! Look! See the shell's fire?

597
01:01:27,329 --> 01:01:29,559
I'm moving up.
I'm moving with you.

598
01:01:30,966 --> 01:01:33,833
What's this all about?
Harrison is alive?

599
01:01:34,236 --> 01:01:37,831
Yep, so is Elvis. I saw that fucking
building blow up! I was there.

600
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:41,941
-You saw him dead?
-The house went down!

601
01:01:44,012 --> 01:01:46,139
But what about that phone call?

602
01:02:00,061 --> 01:02:01,756
-You all right?
-Yeah.

603
01:02:04,499 --> 01:02:08,629
If you know something,
please tell her, Kyle. Please!

604
01:02:08,837 --> 01:02:13,331
I made the call! I made the call,
I wanted to tell her.

605
01:02:13,975 --> 01:02:16,443
She couldn't hear me at the other
end of the line.

606
01:02:17,145 --> 01:02:20,114
-She couldn't hear me.
-They're hitting the hotel!

607
01:02:24,452 --> 01:02:25,942
Sarah!

608
01:02:27,455 --> 01:02:30,652
-You get her...
-Sarah!

609
01:02:32,861 --> 01:02:35,830
Sarah! Sarah!

610
01:02:36,131 --> 01:02:39,032
Get the fuck out!
Get up. Get up.

611
01:02:39,234 --> 01:02:42,431
You can't be afraid, let's go.
Let's go, please. Go.

612
01:02:42,671 --> 01:02:43,831
Come on.

613
01:02:45,974 --> 01:02:49,341
-Let me go! Let me go!
-Sarah!

614
01:02:49,778 --> 01:02:50,802
Come on!

615
01:02:51,012 --> 01:02:53,879
What are you doing?
What are you doing, Sarah?

616
01:02:54,082 --> 01:02:55,879
Come on, get out of here.

617
01:02:56,584 --> 01:02:58,142
Let's go or we'll die!

618
01:03:07,796 --> 01:03:10,492
Get outside!
Get outside!

619
01:03:19,708 --> 01:03:21,266
Hide in the basement.

620
01:03:22,243 --> 01:03:25,371
Shit! We're never gonna get down
to that cellar. It's full up!

621
01:03:25,580 --> 01:03:27,946
We're gonna be stuck in there
like mice in a fucking trap!

622
01:03:28,149 --> 01:03:30,845
Don't they have a
bloody wine cellar?

623
01:03:31,052 --> 01:03:35,421
-This isn't a French restaurant!
-Let's get the fuck out of here!

624
01:03:41,429 --> 01:03:43,158
We got nurse!

625
01:04:04,586 --> 01:04:06,076
Fuck!

626
01:04:08,423 --> 01:04:11,119
Shit! Shit!

627
01:04:11,926 --> 01:04:12,915
Fuck!

628
01:04:14,162 --> 01:04:16,323
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

629
01:04:18,299 --> 01:04:20,665
-Get in the fucking car!
-Animals!

630
01:04:20,869 --> 01:04:22,461
Get in, get in!

631
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:25,867
-Get in! Get in!
-My fucking car!

632
01:04:32,013 --> 01:04:33,412
Shit!

633
01:04:33,615 --> 01:04:36,778
I'll be on the Avis
shit list for sure!

634
01:04:36,985 --> 01:04:41,422
Three cars these assholes totaled.
Where you're going?

635
01:04:47,762 --> 01:04:49,889
-Morris!
-We are going to Vukovar.

636
01:04:50,098 --> 01:04:54,034
-You're out of your mind!
-We're going to Vukovar.

637
01:04:54,235 --> 01:04:55,896
Calm down.

638
01:04:56,104 --> 01:04:58,629
I've got an errand
to run for this lady.

639
01:05:23,164 --> 01:05:25,496
He must have tried
to cross through Osijek.

640
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:28,533
And then he tried
to follow the Serbs...

641
01:05:28,736 --> 01:05:31,102
to get as close as
he could to Vukovar.

642
01:05:32,907 --> 01:05:36,673
Or else he went by way
of Vincovsci.

643
01:05:38,446 --> 01:05:43,440
What would you have done if the
Serbs had closed off the roads?

644
01:05:45,286 --> 01:05:49,518
He would've gone to Vukovar. That's
where we have to go to get the shot.

645
01:05:51,826 --> 01:05:53,350
Right.

646
01:05:53,828 --> 01:05:57,491
And once you're in Vukovar,
can you contact anyone outside?

647
01:06:02,470 --> 01:06:04,904
-And if he is injured...
-Checkpoint.

648
01:06:08,243 --> 01:06:12,043
-Here. It's loaded.
-Blink your headlights.

649
01:06:13,581 --> 01:06:17,677
-You're a photographer, remember.
-Jumpy bunch of little brats.

650
01:06:17,886 --> 01:06:20,320
Slow it up, will you?
Got anything white?

651
01:06:20,522 --> 01:06:21,682
-No.
-Have you?

652
01:06:34,168 --> 01:06:36,932
Slow it fucking up!
How many times did I tell you?

653
01:06:37,138 --> 01:06:40,107
-Right down, right down.
-Shut up, shut up.

654
01:06:41,342 --> 01:06:44,436
They're fucking mad!
Don't say a word to them. Don't...

655
01:06:44,646 --> 01:06:46,876
...are you listening to me?
-Cool it.

656
01:06:54,322 --> 01:06:55,812
Shit!

657
01:06:59,294 --> 01:07:01,353
Press. Press.

658
01:07:51,579 --> 01:07:53,240
How you doing?

659
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:56,508
Smoke?

660
01:07:58,219 --> 01:08:01,416
-You speak English?
-So-so.

661
01:08:06,027 --> 01:08:07,892
-So... what's new?
-The war.

662
01:08:09,430 --> 01:08:13,457
Exactly!
Who holds the city?

663
01:08:13,668 --> 01:08:15,966
-Who holds it?
-We took west side...

664
01:08:16,170 --> 01:08:17,694
from the Bokan militia.

665
01:08:17,905 --> 01:08:19,896
East side is still fighting
but we hold.

666
01:08:20,108 --> 01:08:23,737
-The Chetniks have all the rest.
-This road over here, is it safe?

667
01:08:23,945 --> 01:08:26,243
One kilometer, Serb snipers.

668
01:08:26,447 --> 01:08:29,109
After, I don't know. But they'll
attack, probably tonight.

669
01:08:30,451 --> 01:08:33,284
Kyle, the Chetniks
have all the rest.

670
01:08:35,490 --> 01:08:37,651
Risk your own neck, not mine.

671
01:08:57,745 --> 01:09:00,145
Please, please.
I'm looking for this man.

672
01:09:00,348 --> 01:09:03,283
Have you seen this man?
Photographer. American.

673
01:09:03,484 --> 01:09:08,046
He was here taking pictures.
Have you seen this man?

674
01:09:09,924 --> 01:09:13,758
Let her be, Kyle. Let's go to
Graz, put her in a plane...

675
01:09:13,961 --> 01:09:16,521
and the hell with it.
Lloyd's dead, you know he is.

676
01:09:16,731 --> 01:09:19,199
Everybody fucking knows he is.

677
01:09:19,767 --> 01:09:21,735
Did you see his body?

678
01:09:21,936 --> 01:09:24,302
Did you?
No, okay?

679
01:09:24,505 --> 01:09:26,735
I didn't see anything, so...

680
01:09:26,941 --> 01:09:28,738
if she thinks he's alive,
then maybe he is alive.

681
01:09:28,943 --> 01:09:31,138
-Cut the bullshit, Kyle.
-I'm not bullshitting!

682
01:09:31,345 --> 01:09:33,711
You can't fucking go there.

683
01:09:35,016 --> 01:09:36,950
Why are you doing this?

684
01:09:42,323 --> 01:09:44,052
Look around.

685
01:09:44,258 --> 01:09:46,590
Because If you see that
they're killing everybody...

686
01:09:46,794 --> 01:09:48,625
every fucking way you look...

687
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:51,424
than it doesn't matter if I'm in
Vukovar or somewhere else.

688
01:09:51,632 --> 01:09:53,497
Who gives a shit?

689
01:09:54,001 --> 01:09:56,128
Why are you taking her?

690
01:09:57,939 --> 01:09:59,668
Stevenson...

691
01:10:00,475 --> 01:10:04,536
get off my case, all right?
Or go home to mummy.

692
01:10:06,948 --> 01:10:10,440
Shit. I'd love to see my mummy.

693
01:10:27,034 --> 01:10:28,934
Look at her.

694
01:10:32,273 --> 01:10:35,174
I tell you what,
you go over there and you say:

695
01:10:35,376 --> 01:10:39,608
''Sarah, there's really no use hoping
'cause your husband's dead.''

696
01:10:40,047 --> 01:10:43,210
Go ahead, Marc.
You do it if you got the balls.

697
01:10:43,651 --> 01:10:45,619
I don't.

698
01:10:48,389 --> 01:10:51,290
Please. I'm looking for this man.
Have you seen this man in the area?

699
01:10:51,492 --> 01:10:54,484
He takes pictures.
It's an American photographer.

700
01:10:54,695 --> 01:10:58,791
He could be injured. No?
Please, have you seen this man?

701
01:11:59,293 --> 01:12:01,158
You're out of film.

702
01:12:04,298 --> 01:12:06,289
Picturesque, huh?

703
01:12:08,769 --> 01:12:11,761
They're lucky, you know,
they still have their eyes.

704
01:12:15,176 --> 01:12:17,007
You know what they say?

705
01:12:17,411 --> 01:12:21,370
They say certain Chetnik extremists
when they come to town...

706
01:12:21,816 --> 01:12:24,717
not only do they torture
and kill everybody...

707
01:12:24,919 --> 01:12:27,752
they cut out their eyes
to keep score.

708
01:12:29,824 --> 01:12:33,021
You want to make this trip?
Are you sure?

709
01:12:51,913 --> 01:12:54,347
-Well?
-No way.

710
01:12:54,649 --> 01:12:56,412
They can't warn the snipers.

711
01:12:56,617 --> 01:12:59,177
He says they'll see the
TV sing on the window.

712
01:12:59,387 --> 01:13:01,719
There's always hope.
That's the first quarter mile.

713
01:13:01,923 --> 01:13:04,653
-Fantastic.
-After that, they don't know.

714
01:13:05,059 --> 01:13:09,496
After that, if we're still alive,
it's Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills.

715
01:13:09,697 --> 01:13:11,494
Put your hand on the door handle.
You hear one shot...

716
01:13:11,699 --> 01:13:15,795
you hit the door and go down
in the ditch. Ready, Marc?

717
01:13:17,838 --> 01:13:19,066
Come on.

718
01:13:23,044 --> 01:13:25,137
Step on it. Let's go.

719
01:13:49,114 --> 01:13:51,082
I think we made it.

720
01:13:51,783 --> 01:13:53,580
Shit! Don't jump. Don't jump.
Hang on. Hang on.

721
01:14:02,060 --> 01:14:03,789
Get inside!

722
01:14:05,096 --> 01:14:06,927
Get up! Get up!

723
01:14:11,069 --> 01:14:12,764
Get inside!

724
01:14:15,940 --> 01:14:18,374
Sarah!

725
01:14:29,420 --> 01:14:31,684
God! Help me!

726
01:14:33,191 --> 01:14:35,091
Put the head up!

727
01:14:47,806 --> 01:14:49,774
There's nothing we can do.

728
01:14:52,243 --> 01:14:55,440
-What she's saying?
-She's praying.

729
01:15:23,241 --> 01:15:25,471
What the fuck is that?

730
01:15:26,978 --> 01:15:28,172
It's tanks.

731
01:15:28,379 --> 01:15:29,812
Oh shit!

732
01:15:30,548 --> 01:15:33,915
Shit! My car!
They are fucking destroying my car!

733
01:15:34,118 --> 01:15:36,882
Get down!
Get over to the wall! Come on!

734
01:15:37,722 --> 01:15:40,520
Get away from the window, Marc.
Get away from the fucking window!

735
01:15:40,725 --> 01:15:44,491
-I'm shaking like a fucking leaf.
-Get behind the fucking wall!

736
01:15:46,064 --> 01:15:47,053
Fuck it!

737
01:15:47,265 --> 01:15:49,859
-Shit!
-We're fucking dead.

738
01:16:32,644 --> 01:16:35,511
White House, some analysis...

739
01:16:35,713 --> 01:16:38,307
Nelson? What is it?

740
01:16:41,352 --> 01:16:43,843
-What?
-Look at the name, sir.

741
01:16:51,329 --> 01:16:52,626
Excuse-me

742
01:17:11,983 --> 01:17:14,315
Yes, yes. What is it?

743
01:17:17,322 --> 01:17:19,756
There is no note?

744
01:17:20,091 --> 01:17:21,956
-Nothing?
-No.

745
01:17:22,160 --> 01:17:25,459
Well, yes, there was,
but very short.

746
01:17:26,864 --> 01:17:29,094
No, everything's fine...

747
01:17:30,768 --> 01:17:33,202
You know, nothing in particular.

748
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:38,637
No, no, it's quiet there now.
Yeah, relatively quiet.

749
01:17:38,843 --> 01:17:41,107
It's removed from the fighting.

750
01:17:42,680 --> 01:17:47,515
Yes, yes, I know,
but there's no use worrying.

751
01:17:50,521 --> 01:17:52,853
All right, thank you.

752
01:18:03,701 --> 01:18:05,066
How long did it take
for the film to get through?

753
01:18:05,269 --> 01:18:07,669
Three days.
It's getting worse and worse.

754
01:18:11,509 --> 01:18:13,568
Kyle Morris.
Who's he shooting for?

755
01:18:13,778 --> 01:18:15,871
A.F.P.

756
01:18:17,015 --> 01:18:19,483
-Did you call Simon?
-Yes, right away.

757
01:18:19,684 --> 01:18:21,151
They don't know anything.

758
01:18:21,352 --> 01:18:24,014
Just film they get
from time to time.

759
01:18:25,289 --> 01:18:29,749
It looks like Morris left
this town called Binkowski...

760
01:18:30,461 --> 01:18:33,589
and followed the Serbian offensive.
Since then...

761
01:18:34,465 --> 01:18:37,559
He sent his film along with Sarah's,
that's all we know.

762
01:18:40,805 --> 01:18:45,265
-She's looking for Harrison.
-Oh, great! Give the man a cigar.

763
01:18:49,514 --> 01:18:51,505
She's off her rocket,
for God's sake!

764
01:18:51,716 --> 01:18:53,206
Look, look here.

765
01:18:53,418 --> 01:18:56,182
-They're good pictures, though.
-Look at this.

766
01:18:59,657 --> 01:19:01,887
No, there!

767
01:19:54,712 --> 01:19:57,010
The children are
so beautiful here.

768
01:19:58,850 --> 01:20:01,580
I'd love to put them in the
back and take them somewhere else.

769
01:20:02,286 --> 01:20:04,220
Yeah, we should've bought the bus.

770
01:20:05,723 --> 01:20:08,021
Hang on, we're in trouble here.

771
01:20:19,604 --> 01:20:22,596
They're going to the front. Marc,
put a hook in their ass, come on!

772
01:20:30,882 --> 01:20:33,578
-Get out of the street.
-There's Vukovar. To the right!

773
01:20:33,784 --> 01:20:36,048
Now we're gonna get there.

774
01:20:36,387 --> 01:20:38,355
Now we're gonna get there.

775
01:20:41,526 --> 01:20:44,586
-How many miles?
-About fifteen.

776
01:20:44,996 --> 01:20:48,432
But between the checkpoints and the
mines, it'll take us about 3 hours.

777
01:20:48,633 --> 01:20:51,363
We're going to waltz right
through this, right through!

778
01:20:51,669 --> 01:20:53,330
Maybe the last waltz.

779
01:20:56,941 --> 01:20:58,272
Go right! Go right!

780
01:20:59,944 --> 01:21:01,434
Oh, Christ.

781
01:21:07,185 --> 01:21:09,176
Now, where we go?

782
01:21:18,329 --> 01:21:20,820
-What's this?
-Hold on! Hold on!

783
01:21:21,032 --> 01:21:22,761
What's this?

784
01:21:31,142 --> 01:21:32,939
Hang on, hang on!

785
01:21:40,084 --> 01:21:41,551
Fucking mess!

786
01:21:44,855 --> 01:21:49,292
Got to get the fuck out of here,
guys! Fucking Serbs are coming!

787
01:21:51,262 --> 01:21:54,231
-The shit is gonna fly!
-Where you coming from?

788
01:21:54,932 --> 01:21:58,231
The road from Vukovar.
We couldn't get through.

789
01:21:59,770 --> 01:22:02,739
It's a goddamn bloodbath! They
are killing anything that moves.

790
01:22:03,174 --> 01:22:06,632
A fucking conversation?
Move it, move it!

791
01:22:06,844 --> 01:22:09,176
-Didn't you hear what I just said?
-Kyle, maybe he's right.

792
01:22:09,380 --> 01:22:12,042
Get back in the fucking car!
We're going to Vukovar.

793
01:22:12,250 --> 01:22:15,583
-Move the fucking car.
-He's coming from Vukovar!

794
01:22:15,786 --> 01:22:19,813
You listen to your girlfriend.
It's crawling with death back there!

795
01:22:20,024 --> 01:22:23,289
We've got go in a convoy. We gotta
move to the border all the way...

796
01:22:23,494 --> 01:22:27,590
...to the back, in a convoy!
-We're going to Vukovar, understand?

797
01:22:27,965 --> 01:22:30,695
And you are one dead asshole.

798
01:22:30,901 --> 01:22:33,028
Thanks a lot! Have a nice life.
Be safe.

799
01:22:33,237 --> 01:22:37,196
Get back in the car. You want to
take a rip back with this guy?

800
01:22:37,608 --> 01:22:40,304
You want to get a nice hot bath
in Zagreb?

801
01:22:40,511 --> 01:22:43,742
I understand, stay. Why don't
you grab your bag and stay!

802
01:22:44,148 --> 01:22:46,912
And let you get shot, I don't care.
You're joking me?

803
01:22:47,118 --> 01:22:49,643
That's good,
that's what I want to hear.

804
01:22:52,290 --> 01:22:54,315
-Fuck!
-Help me push it out.

805
01:22:56,394 --> 01:22:58,021
All right, go!

806
01:23:02,500 --> 01:23:04,991
Yeah, I see you.
Very funny. Fuck you too.

807
01:23:08,105 --> 01:23:11,199
Shit! Christ!
It's a fucking inferno.

808
01:23:11,575 --> 01:23:13,668
I'm not gonna stand this.

809
01:23:13,878 --> 01:23:15,368
Come on, we gotta go.

810
01:23:15,579 --> 01:23:18,742
-Where are we going?
-There's a basement over here.

811
01:23:34,098 --> 01:23:35,156
Shit!

812
01:23:39,603 --> 01:23:41,161
Get up.

813
01:23:42,473 --> 01:23:44,031
Come on, Marc.

814
01:24:39,797 --> 01:24:41,731
You okay?

815
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:47,034
I'm scared too.

816
01:24:47,238 --> 01:24:48,967
We're all scared.

817
01:24:52,276 --> 01:24:54,676
I really don't like dead bodies.

818
01:25:01,118 --> 01:25:05,987
They know that our photos are going
to tell the story of this war.

819
01:25:06,891 --> 01:25:10,588
You understand that?
They know that's why we're here.

820
01:25:12,096 --> 01:25:15,759
Alright? If we don't take them,
nobody will.

821
01:25:17,535 --> 01:25:20,163
They want us to do what we do.

822
01:25:24,809 --> 01:25:27,801
Maybe I can wake up some guy who's
yelling about a parking ticket!

823
01:25:28,012 --> 01:25:30,913
Show him there are better
things to be upset about.

824
01:25:35,986 --> 01:25:39,649
It's good work your husband does,
you know? Really good.

825
01:25:43,294 --> 01:25:45,660
Why are you doing this?

826
01:25:47,164 --> 01:25:49,997
Doing what? This?

827
01:25:51,235 --> 01:25:56,468
This is for me. 'Cause I haven't
done anything with my life...

828
01:25:58,209 --> 01:26:00,575
and I've always wanted to be
a boy scout.

829
01:26:01,178 --> 01:26:04,113
Just needed an opportunity.

830
01:26:10,221 --> 01:26:12,621
You want to sleep or you want to
stick it out, 'cause I've got...

831
01:26:12,823 --> 01:26:15,656
Phenobarbitol and
I've got Benzedrine.

832
01:26:16,327 --> 01:26:20,320
Come on! Look. If there's even an
excuse to do drugs...

833
01:26:21,065 --> 01:26:23,090
you're looking at it.

834
01:26:24,235 --> 01:26:28,934
Besides, when you sleep,
you forget about food.

835
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:33,332
And I'm starving!
Are you hungry?

836
01:26:33,544 --> 01:26:35,978
-Yes.
-Well, there's your dinner.

837
01:26:50,561 --> 01:26:54,190
Harrison and I got into a fight
the night of the Pulitzer.

838
01:26:54,398 --> 01:26:56,366
I know.

839
01:26:58,002 --> 01:27:00,664
-He told you about it?
-Yes.

840
01:27:05,543 --> 01:27:10,503
Well, I feel bad about it now.
I mean... just stupid.

841
01:27:11,949 --> 01:27:14,713
Don't worry about it,
I'll explain it to him.

842
01:27:26,430 --> 01:27:28,193
Good night.

843
01:27:40,311 --> 01:27:42,711
You think he's dead, right?

844
01:27:44,348 --> 01:27:46,248
Are you kidding?

845
01:27:47,518 --> 01:27:49,748
Harrison's immortal.

846
01:28:06,403 --> 01:28:08,598
Gentleman!

847
01:28:08,806 --> 01:28:11,604
Dumb and dumber, huh?

848
01:28:16,113 --> 01:28:19,014
You're blind as well as ignorant.
Look at them.

849
01:28:23,988 --> 01:28:26,479
I knew you guys were here.
I saw your car outside.

850
01:28:26,690 --> 01:28:30,558
Sorry, you got a parking ticket.
I tried to stop her...

851
01:28:30,761 --> 01:28:33,696
but it was too late.
It had already started to rain.

852
01:28:35,232 --> 01:28:37,200
'Evening, ma'am.

853
01:28:37,401 --> 01:28:39,392
Nice to see you again.

854
01:28:39,603 --> 01:28:41,969
Still kicking around
our neck of the woods?

855
01:28:42,172 --> 01:28:43,469
Sure am.

856
01:28:48,812 --> 01:28:50,609
Where's Cathy?

857
01:28:50,814 --> 01:28:52,179
Died.

858
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:54,613
Yesterday.

859
01:28:54,818 --> 01:28:57,082
Took a sniper's bullet...

860
01:28:58,622 --> 01:29:01,489
right in the head.
Never felt a thing.

861
01:29:04,695 --> 01:29:06,322
Where?

862
01:29:07,665 --> 01:29:10,691
On the road to Vukovar.

863
01:29:52,676 --> 01:29:54,541
Look at this.

864
01:29:58,315 --> 01:29:59,714
Shit!

865
01:29:59,917 --> 01:30:01,646
Shit!

866
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:04,751
Shit.

867
01:30:07,858 --> 01:30:11,350
Put this on your face
for the stink.

868
01:30:20,537 --> 01:30:22,732
It's that girl in the yellow
dress.

869
01:30:23,607 --> 01:30:27,202
They fucking raped her!
Fucking raped her!

870
01:30:52,936 --> 01:30:54,870
Are you okay?

871
01:31:21,965 --> 01:31:23,990
Come on. Come on!

872
01:31:36,980 --> 01:31:39,710
-Slow it up!
-All right, all right.

873
01:31:40,217 --> 01:31:42,378
What is this?

874
01:31:48,525 --> 01:31:50,720
-Slow it.
-All right, all right.

875
01:31:52,563 --> 01:31:56,158
Jesus. What the fuck is that?

876
01:31:58,802 --> 01:32:01,032
-Press.
-Press.

877
01:32:01,705 --> 01:32:04,003
-Come on, buddy.
-God Almighty!

878
01:32:14,751 --> 01:32:16,480
Come on, guys.

879
01:32:17,387 --> 01:32:18,979
Ever get the feeling
you're not welcome?

880
01:32:19,189 --> 01:32:23,125
They're freaking out. They lose
Vukovar, they lose the war.

881
01:32:24,061 --> 01:32:26,052
They lose the war, they're dead.

882
01:32:28,198 --> 01:32:30,359
Oh, God!

883
01:32:32,502 --> 01:32:34,800
Look at that dog.

884
01:32:39,977 --> 01:32:41,467
Look!

885
01:32:42,346 --> 01:32:45,838
Park it up. Looks like
someone got here before us.

886
01:33:17,648 --> 01:33:19,582
Look at that!

887
01:33:20,284 --> 01:33:22,980
Yeager, fuck face, Pollack!

888
01:33:24,354 --> 01:33:27,289
Don't tell me this war
has gone prime time.

889
01:33:30,294 --> 01:33:32,558
It's a miracle you're still alive.

890
01:33:33,130 --> 01:33:36,964
So let's praise God and thank the
Lord and let's get back to Zagred.

891
01:33:37,167 --> 01:33:40,398
-Doesn't anyone thank me?
-Thanks, Kyle.

892
01:33:40,604 --> 01:33:41,593
Yeah. For?

893
01:33:44,474 --> 01:33:46,704
-For taking care of Sarah.
-That's right.

894
01:33:47,544 --> 01:33:50,945
-For taking care of Sarah.
-That's much nicer, you see?

895
01:33:51,148 --> 01:33:53,548
''Thanks, Morris, for taking care
of Sarah Lloyd.''

896
01:33:53,750 --> 01:33:56,878
-Polite and nice.
-What I am not saying?

897
01:33:57,254 --> 01:33:59,654
That's not enough?

898
01:34:00,290 --> 01:34:02,417
-So now what? Vukovar is out?
-That's right!

899
01:34:02,626 --> 01:34:05,094
-Can you let her speak for herself?
-Asshole!

900
01:34:05,295 --> 01:34:08,287
There are Serbian snipers
not a hundred yards away.

901
01:34:08,498 --> 01:34:10,932
They are shooting fish in a barrel.
You can't get through.

902
01:34:13,070 --> 01:34:15,595
What do you think the Croatians are
getting ready for?

903
01:34:15,906 --> 01:34:17,339
A party?

904
01:34:17,541 --> 01:34:20,066
Doesn't that give you some inkling
about what's going to happen here?

905
01:34:23,780 --> 01:34:25,577
I'm going anyway.

906
01:34:25,983 --> 01:34:29,146
You can't get in to Vukocar, man.
Nobody gets in nobody gets out!

907
01:34:29,353 --> 01:34:31,878
All you can do in Vukovar is die.

908
01:34:32,089 --> 01:34:35,957
What the fuck do you know?
Jumping out of an airplane.

909
01:34:36,159 --> 01:34:38,855
What you're fucking looking at me
for? I'm trying to help you, guys!

910
01:34:39,062 --> 01:34:41,530
-What is this with you?
-I got photos to take.

911
01:34:41,932 --> 01:34:45,197
You got photos to take! Take them!
Nobody is telling you not to take!

912
01:34:45,402 --> 01:34:48,098
-That's enough!
-You don't have to take her!

913
01:34:48,305 --> 01:34:50,705
-It's enough.
-I'm going, Yeager. I have to go.

914
01:34:50,907 --> 01:34:52,807
If there's half a chance he's
in that hospital. I have to go.

915
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:57,510
He's dead!
He's dead, Sarah! Please!

916
01:35:11,261 --> 01:35:13,024
Sarah!

917
01:35:15,732 --> 01:35:18,064
You'll run out of film, Stevenson.

918
01:35:19,436 --> 01:35:21,597
What you're doing here, anyway?

919
01:35:22,472 --> 01:35:26,067
Get on with your life,
write a book or something!

920
01:35:27,511 --> 01:35:30,002
-Write a book!
-Well...

921
01:35:35,986 --> 01:35:38,216
I know why you are here.

922
01:35:39,456 --> 01:35:41,890
I know you came for her...

923
01:35:43,226 --> 01:35:46,787
but you're not going to change her
mind from doing what she needs to do.

924
01:35:46,997 --> 01:35:49,465
Not unless you show her
Harrison's body. So...

925
01:35:49,666 --> 01:35:53,158
do what I do. All right?
Help her.

926
01:35:57,074 --> 01:36:00,043
We better both pray that some day
we find somebody...

927
01:36:00,243 --> 01:36:02,803
that loves us the way
she loves him.

928
01:36:05,549 --> 01:36:06,538
Understand?

929
01:36:11,488 --> 01:36:14,719
There was this mercenary,
this Frenchman guy...

930
01:36:16,193 --> 01:36:17,956
Fuck!

931
01:36:18,662 --> 01:36:24,828
He saw a guy, an American
photographer, about 6, 8 days ago.

932
01:36:27,704 --> 01:36:30,832
The Frenchman said he looked
pretty bad, but he was alive...

933
01:36:33,710 --> 01:36:36,440
but he might be in there,
in that hospital.

934
01:36:49,793 --> 01:36:52,421
Well, next stop, Vukovar!

935
01:36:52,629 --> 01:36:55,757
<i>We went to see the base Commander</i>
<i>to ask him to let us leave</i>.

936
01:36:57,567 --> 01:37:00,593
We were exhausted. The fear was
eating through us at that stage.

937
01:37:01,538 --> 01:37:03,904
We knew the horror that was...

938
01:37:04,841 --> 01:37:06,570
waiting for us.

939
01:37:07,377 --> 01:37:10,073
If she had hesitated for one
second, we would've turned back.

940
01:37:11,348 --> 01:37:13,646
She didn't hesitate.

941
01:37:14,985 --> 01:37:16,316
So, we got ready.

942
01:37:17,154 --> 01:37:19,418
We leave at ten-second intervals.

943
01:37:20,490 --> 01:37:25,427
The highway should be about 3/ 4
of a mile behind that wooded area.

944
01:37:26,796 --> 01:37:31,460
We run for one minute,
stop for one minute, then go again.

945
01:37:32,369 --> 01:37:36,362
Any shooting, we stop and count
again from zero.

946
01:37:40,710 --> 01:37:43,838
Any one of us catches up
with anyone else, we wait to...

947
01:37:44,047 --> 01:37:50,646
re-establish the distance. Anybody
gets wounded, no going backwards.

948
01:37:53,290 --> 01:37:55,724
The next one will take care
of it, okay?

949
01:37:57,027 --> 01:37:58,892
What if the last one
gets wounded?

950
01:37:59,095 --> 01:38:01,996
You go first.
Then Kyle, then Sarah.

951
01:38:02,199 --> 01:38:03,894
I'll bring up the rear.

952
01:38:04,100 --> 01:38:07,126
-I'll go first.
-Sarah, please.

953
01:38:09,806 --> 01:38:12,104
-Okay, Stevenson?
-Okay.

954
01:38:14,945 --> 01:38:17,243
Go. Anytime you're ready.

955
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:22,601
Go. Go.

956
01:43:20,316 --> 01:43:22,250
Sarah!

957
01:43:27,323 --> 01:43:29,291
-Where are we?
-Okay, listen.

958
01:43:29,492 --> 01:43:32,154
You gotta take this off.
Take this off.

959
01:43:39,536 --> 01:43:41,299
You're all right?

960
01:43:42,438 --> 01:43:44,429
Smile. Stay cool.

961
01:43:44,641 --> 01:43:46,939
They can't get over us making
it past their snipers.

962
01:43:47,143 --> 01:43:49,668
They admire strength, they hate
weakness. Keep your chin up!

963
01:43:49,879 --> 01:43:52,370
They think we're fabulous.
Your leg is bad?

964
01:43:52,582 --> 01:43:54,743
It's okay.
Will they let us through?

965
01:43:54,951 --> 01:43:57,852
Whatever's going on the other side
they don't want any witness.

966
01:43:58,054 --> 01:44:01,217
Relax. Put a smile on your face.
They love us.

967
01:44:01,424 --> 01:44:04,018
They think we're
hilariously funny.

968
01:44:04,227 --> 01:44:06,923
See that big guy there?
Say hi to the big guy.

969
01:44:09,332 --> 01:44:11,527
Nobody's made it through before us.
What do we do?

970
01:44:11,734 --> 01:44:15,033
-Walk. Walk.
-Thank you.

971
01:44:17,140 --> 01:44:20,007
-They know where the hospital is?
-We'll find it, we'll find it.

972
01:44:21,411 --> 01:44:23,641
Listen! Listen!

973
01:44:23,980 --> 01:44:28,041
-It's time to go back to Zagreb.
-It's so stupid it might work.

974
01:44:28,251 --> 01:44:30,776
Don't turn around!
Don't turn around!

975
01:44:30,987 --> 01:44:32,887
You want a photo?

976
01:44:33,089 --> 01:44:35,353
Keep walking!

977
01:44:52,842 --> 01:44:56,801
<i>We kept walking, l don't know</i>
<i>how far, how long but</i>...

978
01:44:59,315 --> 01:45:01,977
then we were in the streets
of Vukovar.

979
01:46:20,029 --> 01:46:23,726
<i>lt wasn't fighting</i>.
<i>lt was extermination</i>.

980
01:46:24,100 --> 01:46:27,194
<i>They would later call it ''ethnic</i>
<i>cleansing'', we were watching this</i>.

981
01:46:28,037 --> 01:46:30,972
<i>Bayonets, knives, teeth</i>.

982
01:46:31,774 --> 01:46:35,005
<i>Children, they slit the throats</i>
<i>of children</i>.

983
01:46:35,244 --> 01:46:37,474
<i>There were corpses everywhere</i>.

984
01:46:42,652 --> 01:46:47,214
<i>There was one woman. She had a</i>
<i>sign around her neck saying:</i>

985
01:46:47,423 --> 01:46:50,881
<i>''l carry the child of a Serb.''</i>

986
01:46:53,396 --> 01:46:56,888
And I asked myself,
''What are we doing here?''

987
01:47:37,507 --> 01:47:38,940
Get back,
get back.

988
01:47:41,210 --> 01:47:42,734
Bastards!

989
01:47:49,485 --> 01:47:51,316
They're bastards!

990
01:47:54,791 --> 01:47:56,156
You bastards!

991
01:47:56,359 --> 01:48:00,557
<i>lt was unbelievable. l was asking</i>
<i>myself, ''What are we doing here?''</i>

992
01:48:00,763 --> 01:48:06,030
<i>''Have we gone crazy or what?'' We</i>
<i>walked straight into the darkness</i>.

993
01:48:06,235 --> 01:48:08,760
<i>And we weren't gonna</i>
<i>come out again</i>.

994
01:48:18,314 --> 01:48:19,941
Photographers!

995
01:48:21,617 --> 01:48:23,312
Photographers!

996
01:48:45,308 --> 01:48:47,833
That's the fucking hospital.

997
01:48:48,711 --> 01:48:50,303
Come on, come on.
Let's go!

998
01:48:50,680 --> 01:48:52,477
Let's go!

999
01:48:52,682 --> 01:48:54,172
Go! Go! Go!

1000
01:48:54,383 --> 01:48:56,112
Come on, Marc.

1001
01:49:07,396 --> 01:49:08,863
Over here.

1002
01:49:09,765 --> 01:49:11,528
Get inside!

1003
01:49:12,368 --> 01:49:14,336
The fucking Arkan guys!
Man! They're crazy!

1004
01:49:17,773 --> 01:49:19,035
Marc!

1005
01:49:19,242 --> 01:49:20,903
Marc, get over here!

1006
01:49:21,110 --> 01:49:25,274
Come on, come on!
Fuck! Fuck!

1007
01:49:26,282 --> 01:49:27,806
-Come on.
-I don't want to be here.

1008
01:49:28,017 --> 01:49:31,043
-I don't want to stay here.
-Come on.

1009
01:49:34,123 --> 01:49:36,614
My bag! My bag!

1010
01:49:38,394 --> 01:49:40,021
I don't wanna go.

1011
01:49:55,544 --> 01:49:59,241
-It smells! It stinks of death!
-Take it easy, Marc.

1012
01:49:59,448 --> 01:50:01,279
No, no. We gotta go!
We can't stay here.

1013
01:50:01,484 --> 01:50:05,045
-You can't go out there!
-We can't!

1014
01:50:05,254 --> 01:50:07,051
Stay put!

1015
01:50:07,256 --> 01:50:09,224
Just listen to me!
They're going to kill us.

1016
01:50:09,425 --> 01:50:11,655
I'm begging you, Kyle.
Please. I got to go now!

1017
01:50:11,861 --> 01:50:14,659
Get your hands off me!

1018
01:50:14,864 --> 01:50:16,058
Stay over here!

1019
01:50:16,265 --> 01:50:18,495
-You can't go out!
-Get off!

1020
01:50:24,140 --> 01:50:26,904
Hang in there.
Look at me.

1021
01:50:27,109 --> 01:50:31,011
You're looking for a dead man?
There's thousands of them!

1022
01:50:31,213 --> 01:50:33,613
I know, I know.
Marc, come on.

1023
01:50:34,517 --> 01:50:37,645
It's all right. Look, they're gone.
They're gone, Marc.

1024
01:50:37,954 --> 01:50:41,651
Kyle! Kyle!

1025
01:50:45,328 --> 01:50:48,058
I got you! I got you!

1026
01:50:48,931 --> 01:50:52,423
I got you. Don't worry.
You're gonna be all right. Come on.

1027
01:50:52,635 --> 01:50:54,694
Come on!

1028
01:50:54,904 --> 01:50:57,668
Come on, I got you.

1029
01:51:04,013 --> 01:51:06,504
Going to be all right.

1030
01:51:09,418 --> 01:51:11,147
Shit.

1031
01:51:12,321 --> 01:51:14,846
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1032
01:51:16,692 --> 01:51:18,387
I'm sorry.

1033
01:51:22,598 --> 01:51:24,395
Shit!

1034
01:51:37,546 --> 01:51:40,106
It's almost nightfall.

1035
01:51:42,251 --> 01:51:44,515
If the Serbs attack, they are
going to hit the hospital first.

1036
01:51:46,455 --> 01:51:50,414
It there's any hope in getting
Harrison, we got to move now.

1037
01:51:51,827 --> 01:51:56,127
And we'll come back...
This is what we came for, right?

1038
01:51:59,668 --> 01:52:01,795
God-damn it.

1039
01:52:03,506 --> 01:52:05,235
All right, all right.
We better get going.

1040
01:52:05,441 --> 01:52:08,342
All right, all right!

1041
01:52:08,544 --> 01:52:10,535
I'm sorry.

1042
01:52:11,247 --> 01:52:13,374
It's okay. It's okay.

1043
01:52:13,682 --> 01:52:16,082
It's okay.

1044
01:52:29,098 --> 01:52:31,157
I'm sorry.

1045
01:52:32,968 --> 01:52:35,027
Come on, come on.

1046
01:52:37,740 --> 01:52:39,674
God-damn it.

1047
01:52:40,509 --> 01:52:42,977
This way.

1048
01:53:03,199 --> 01:53:06,134
We can't, Sarah. It's too late.
We got to get to shelter! Come on!

1049
01:53:06,335 --> 01:53:07,962
Marc, shelter!

1050
01:53:08,170 --> 01:53:09,762
Sarah!

1051
01:53:10,773 --> 01:53:12,536
Sarah!

1052
01:53:21,717 --> 01:53:23,412
I'm looking for an American man.

1053
01:53:24,620 --> 01:53:27,248
-Help me!
-Take a photo!

1054
01:53:27,490 --> 01:53:31,290
They must know!
They must know!

1055
01:54:09,398 --> 01:54:11,332
Harrison!

1056
01:54:14,470 --> 01:54:16,631
Harrison!

1057
01:55:53,636 --> 01:55:55,365
Harrison!

1058
01:55:55,671 --> 01:55:58,367
Harrison! Harrison!

1059
01:56:04,446 --> 01:56:07,210
It's me, Sarah!

1060
01:56:07,950 --> 01:56:10,578
Harrison. My God!

1061
01:56:10,786 --> 01:56:12,754
My God, Harrison.

1062
01:56:12,955 --> 01:56:14,650
Harrison.

1063
01:56:22,398 --> 01:56:24,559
It's me, Sarah.

1064
01:56:26,802 --> 01:56:28,997
It's me, Sarah.

1065
01:56:29,738 --> 01:56:31,672
Harrison.

1066
01:56:31,974 --> 01:56:34,169
What's wrong with you?

1067
01:56:35,711 --> 01:56:37,372
Harrison!

1068
01:56:51,727 --> 01:56:53,092
Come on!

1069
01:56:53,295 --> 01:56:54,557
Come on!

1070
01:56:54,763 --> 01:56:57,459
<i>No one knows how Harrison</i>
<i>left the hospital</i>.

1071
01:56:57,800 --> 01:57:01,361
He was suffering from what they
call ''bomb blast effect''.

1072
01:57:01,570 --> 01:57:05,370
It's trauma caused by a bomb
exploding in close proximity.

1073
01:57:06,542 --> 01:57:11,479
<i>Harrison was delirious</i>.
<i>Sarah took off his dirty bandages</i>.

1074
01:57:11,680 --> 01:57:16,982
<i>And realized he had burns</i>
<i>over most of his body</i>.

1075
01:57:17,186 --> 01:57:22,886
<i>He was in unbearable, unspeakable</i>
<i>pain, but he said nothing</i>.

1076
01:57:25,561 --> 01:57:27,859
<i>He was somewhere else</i>.

1077
01:57:29,264 --> 01:57:32,324
<i>He couldn't eat. So</i>...

1078
01:57:32,534 --> 01:57:37,198
Sarah would give him little
pieces of bread dipped in water...

1079
01:57:37,406 --> 01:57:39,772
<i>like you would a wounded bird</i>
<i>or something</i>.

1080
01:57:40,509 --> 01:57:42,841
<i>lt was beautiful</i>.

1081
01:57:43,045 --> 01:57:46,742
<i>She kept talking to him</i>,
<i>reassuring him</i>.

1082
01:57:50,552 --> 01:57:54,989
<i>She seemed</i>...
<i>she seemed at peace somehow</i>.

1083
01:57:57,626 --> 01:58:00,561
<i>l know it sounds crazy</i>
<i>to say but</i>...

1084
01:58:01,764 --> 01:58:04,164
<i>she seemed almost happy</i>.

1085
01:58:04,900 --> 01:58:09,803
November the 1 8th, 1 991 ,
silence was restored.

1086
01:58:12,574 --> 01:58:15,668
Ever since that day
I've known that peace is silence.

1087
01:58:33,662 --> 01:58:36,563
<i>Mile Dedakovic had ordered his</i>
<i>Croatian troops to surrender</i>...

1088
01:58:36,765 --> 01:58:39,563
<i>after eighty-seven days of siege</i>.

1089
01:58:41,303 --> 01:58:43,328
<i>And finally Vukovar felt</i>.

1090
01:58:46,108 --> 01:58:48,474
<i>Milosevic had won</i>.

1091
01:58:51,580 --> 01:58:54,549
<i>ln that one battle</i>,
<i>the battle of Vukovar</i>...

1092
01:58:55,250 --> 01:58:58,185
<i>over fifteen thousand</i>
<i>people lost their lives</i>.

1093
01:59:30,819 --> 01:59:32,844
Come on, it's all right.

1094
01:59:47,436 --> 01:59:49,461
It's okay.

1095
02:00:59,341 --> 02:01:02,572
Cesar is enormous.

1096
02:01:02,778 --> 02:01:05,372
They change so much
at this age.

1097
02:01:06,114 --> 02:01:08,548
He's...
In the last few months...

1098
02:01:10,118 --> 02:01:12,245
he's become a young man.

1099
02:01:15,157 --> 02:01:19,685
I think I did the right thing by not
bringing the kids to the hospital.

1100
02:01:20,228 --> 02:01:22,560
I didn't want them to see you.

1101
02:01:24,066 --> 02:01:28,298
I mean, when you weren't well,
you know...

1102
02:02:02,504 --> 02:02:04,233
Daddy!

1103
02:02:07,976 --> 02:02:09,671
Daddy!

1104
02:02:10,646 --> 02:02:12,375
Daddy!

1105
02:02:12,948 --> 02:02:14,939
Hi, daddy.

1106
02:02:17,586 --> 02:02:20,214
Okay. Margaux.
Come on, sweetheart.

1107
02:02:28,063 --> 02:02:29,655
Come on.

1108
02:02:45,981 --> 02:02:48,176
Watch this, daddy.

1109
02:02:49,851 --> 02:02:52,649
Daddy? Watch this.

1110
02:02:52,854 --> 02:02:55,414
I'm going to do the submarine.

1111
02:02:55,724 --> 02:02:57,692
Daddy?

1112
02:03:10,739 --> 02:03:12,604
Come here.

1113
02:03:15,143 --> 02:03:17,134
Sit down. Sit down!

1114
02:03:17,345 --> 02:03:19,176
Sit down.

1115
02:03:21,016 --> 02:03:22,847
Sit down.

1116
02:03:27,322 --> 02:03:29,552
I'm going to do the submarine.

1117
02:04:00,288 --> 02:04:02,916
I took care of your flowers.

1118
02:04:03,592 --> 02:04:06,322
Not one of them got ruined.

1119
02:04:12,534 --> 02:04:14,832
I'm going to do some work.

1120
02:04:17,806 --> 02:04:20,206
I'm going to do
the submarine again.

1121
02:04:51,473 --> 02:04:53,134
Harrison?

1122
02:05:29,477 --> 02:05:31,206
Harrison!

1123
02:05:33,748 --> 02:05:35,579
Sarah.

1124
02:05:45,827 --> 02:05:46,987
Hi, Sarah.

1125
02:05:52,033 --> 02:05:54,433
Cesar took care of the flowers.

1126
02:05:56,338 --> 02:05:59,637
All this time, he told me he took
care of the flowers.

1127
02:06:03,712 --> 02:06:06,681
My little boy took care
of the flowers.

1128
02:06:10,185 --> 02:06:12,585
What happened to me?

1129
02:06:27,936 --> 02:06:29,995
<i>They live in St. Louis now</i>.

1130
02:06:30,605 --> 02:06:33,597
<i>They've got a house there</i> ,
<i>not far from the Botanical Gardens</i>.

1131
02:06:35,010 --> 02:06:38,502
<i>Harrison's doing fine, thank God</i>.

1132
02:06:39,281 --> 02:06:42,341
<i>He never watches the TV news</i>
<i>anymore, that's for sure</i>...

1133
02:06:42,550 --> 02:06:44,814
<i>and he takes pictures of flowers</i>.
