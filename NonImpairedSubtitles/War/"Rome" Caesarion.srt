00:01:35,894 --> 00:01:37,435
Episode 1x08 :
Caesarion*

2
00:01:37,436 --> 00:01:37,436
* "Little Caesar".
He'll be Ptolemy XV
and the last Greek pharaoh.
(cf. note line 311).

3
00:03:11,033 --> 00:03:12,556
"A fine reward is offered

4
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:15,090
for the return of a slave woman

5
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,299
stolen

6
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,347
or absconded

7
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,650
from the house
of Claudius Appius.

8
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:23,934
The following noblemen
returning from Greece

9
00:03:24,034 --> 00:03:29,234
have received pardon of
Caesar and must not be harmed:

10
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,738
Publius Servilius Casca*,

11
00:03:31,739 --> 00:03:31,739
* One of Caesar's murderers.

12
00:03:32,048 --> 00:03:35,186
Marcus Tullius Cicero,

13
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,205
Gaius Cassius Longinus*

14
00:03:38,206 --> 00:03:38,206
* He'll be though one of the leading
conspirators in the plot for murdering Caesar.

15
00:03:38,367 --> 00:03:43,234
and Marcus Junius Brutus*.

16
00:03:43,235 --> 00:03:43,235
* One of Caesar's murderers.

17
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:46,055
The traitor Pompey
has fled to Egypt.

18
00:03:46,074 --> 00:03:48,834
Glorious Caesar follows."

19
00:04:17,934 --> 00:04:20,050
Shoulder arms !

20
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:22,908
Forward !

21
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,585
Forward face !

22
00:04:29,968 --> 00:04:31,925
Forward march !

23
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,401
Behold Ptolemy,

24
00:05:21,467 --> 00:05:23,582
he of the two ladies,

25
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:27,221
he of sedge and bee*.

26
00:05:27,468 --> 00:05:27,468
* The sedge and the bee are symbols
of Upper and Lower Egypt.

27
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,234
Behold Ptolemy,

28
00:05:31,501 --> 00:05:33,434
son of Ra,

29
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:36,800
Ptolemy the divine.

30
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:45,868
Greetings...

31
00:06:14,801 --> 00:06:19,067
How long may we hope for the
blessing of your presence ?

32
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:20,060
Not long.

33
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,772
We are desolated.

34
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,890
If His Glorious Honor cares

35
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,839
to divulge His purpose here,

36
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:30,138
the servants of the Mighty Lion
would be ecstatic

37
00:06:30,073 --> 00:06:33,232
to help you
in any way whatsoever.

38
00:06:33,334 --> 00:06:35,767
That is most kind of you.

39
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,765
How goes your
preparation for war ?

40
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,897
War ?

41
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:46,668
We have no war prepared.

42
00:06:46,767 --> 00:06:48,700
I'm misinformed then.

43
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:50,700
I was told the sister
of the Mighty Lion

44
00:06:50,767 --> 00:06:53,700
disputes his right
to the throne.

45
00:06:53,730 --> 00:06:56,093
Do not speak of her.

46
00:06:56,201 --> 00:06:57,621
I piss on her !

47
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,800
I shit on her !

48
00:06:59,801 --> 00:07:00,760
It is true

49
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,985
our beloved princess

50
00:07:02,034 --> 00:07:03,569
has listened to ill counsel

51
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:06,396
and raised some absurd claim.

52
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,722
But...

53
00:07:07,922 --> 00:07:09,897
she has no support,

54
00:07:09,832 --> 00:07:13,434
None but traitors
and barbarians.

55
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,701
What was that name ?

56
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:18,500
Deilogos of Pergamum.

57
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:21,134
He can raise ten legions.

58
00:07:21,201 --> 00:07:23,134
Deilogos of Pergamum

59
00:07:23,201 --> 00:07:26,334
Can raise
ten legions for her.

60
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,900
A petty bandit.

61
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,545
I assure you, you have no problem,

62
00:07:30,564 --> 00:07:34,001
no fears at all
about Cleopatra.

63
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:35,243
Where is she ?

64
00:07:35,334 --> 00:07:37,060
Well, nobody knows.

65
00:07:37,634 --> 00:07:40,667
Somewhere in the South,
we believe.

66
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,824
He lies.

67
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,620
They have her.

68
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:47,700
This dispute between
you both must end.

69
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:50,867
Rome desires Egypt
to be at peace.

70
00:07:50,934 --> 00:07:53,934
Your grain ships
must keep sailing.

71
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:55,934
We are in absolute
control of the country,

72
00:07:56,001 --> 00:07:58,101
from the lighthouse
to the cataracts.

73
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,700
Good, in that case
you should have no trouble

74
00:08:00,717 --> 00:08:02,894
in handing over Pompey Magnus.

75
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:04,834
I do not like his tone.

76
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,653
He can go.

77
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,684
Master,

78
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:12,680
do you remember
what we spoke of before ?

79
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:15,334
Of crocodile and fox ?

80
00:08:16,667 --> 00:08:18,967
Let us show him our surprise !

81
00:08:19,034 --> 00:08:21,834
All right, go on.
Show him.

82
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:29,201
We have a gift for you,
Glorious Excellency,

83
00:08:29,268 --> 00:08:32,867
that we think you will
be very pleased with.

84
00:09:10,268 --> 00:09:11,967
We were going to
make him a body,

85
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,486
moving arms and legs,

86
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,735
and do a mime show
with real animals and everything...

87
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:17,467
Silence !

88
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:30,001
Shame on the house of Ptolemies

89
00:09:30,010 --> 00:09:32,200
for such barbarity.
Shame.

90
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,112
But...

91
00:09:33,412 --> 00:09:35,269
you are enemies.

92
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:38,026
He was a consul of Rome !

93
00:09:45,268 --> 00:09:47,901
A consul of Rome.

94
00:09:49,101 --> 00:09:51,634
To die in this sordid way...

95
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:55,533
Quartered
like some low thief...

96
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,171
Shame !

97
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,502
Where is the rest of him ?

98
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:05,667
Eh, um, he has been
cremated...

99
00:10:05,734 --> 00:10:08,546
with all proper
funeral rites, of course.

100
00:10:08,822 --> 00:10:10,762
With all decorum.

101
00:10:11,201 --> 00:10:13,231
I shall return tomorrow,

102
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:15,581
at which time

103
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:19,600
you will give me the man
that took Pompey's life.

104
00:11:20,667 --> 00:11:23,500
Captain says the wind is fair.

105
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,476
- Good.
- We can leave

106
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,700
whenever you like.

107
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:31,368
You will take half the men,
return to Rome immediately.

108
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:35,724
You shall have the honor
of announcing Pompey's death.

109
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:39,134
I shall follow you...

110
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:41,734
when I've settled things here.

111
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,854
Settled things ?

112
00:11:49,214 --> 00:11:50,802
Settled what things ?

113
00:11:50,868 --> 00:11:53,469
Civil war is in the air.

114
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,576
It must be prevented.

115
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:57,934
Why ?

116
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:00,907
Let the wretches
fight it out.

117
00:12:02,033 --> 00:12:04,634
War will disrupt
the grain supply.

118
00:12:04,701 --> 00:12:08,534
Without Egyptian grain,
Rome goes hungry.

119
00:12:08,901 --> 00:12:10,416
It would be...

120
00:12:10,616 --> 00:12:13,353
unwise not to intervene.

121
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:17,199
And how will you intervene
with only half a legion ?

122
00:12:17,213 --> 00:12:19,097
I do not intend to fight.

123
00:12:19,867 --> 00:12:23,257
I shall merely arbitrate
the various factions.

124
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,142
You make it
sound so easy.

125
00:12:26,534 --> 00:12:31,491
Those various factions are united
only by their hatred of Rome.

126
00:12:33,434 --> 00:12:35,143
He's right.

127
00:12:35,434 --> 00:12:39,890
Ptolemy might use you to rouse
the people against a common enemy.

128
00:12:39,901 --> 00:12:42,834
I have conquered Gaul.

129
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:45,067
I have defeated Pompey Magnus.

130
00:12:45,133 --> 00:12:48,133
I think I can handle
a small boy and a eunuch.

131
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:51,067
A small boy with 100,000 men.

132
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,000
I am aware of that !

133
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:55,133
He's still a boy nonetheless.

134
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,270
You seem to forget that

135
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:00,785
that our war is not over yet.

136
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,240
Cato and Scipio
are still at large.

137
00:13:03,275 --> 00:13:06,134
Given time, they will
raise another army.

138
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,090
And when they do
I shall crush them.

139
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,400
I'm glad
you're so confident.

140
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:13,934
Some would call it hubris*.

141
00:13:13,935 --> 00:13:13,935
* hubris or hybris.
Greek word often translated by "immoderation",
used to refer to the pride feeling
that lead a man to think he's like a god.
That unforgivable sin is often one
of the motivating forces in Greek tragedies.

142
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,034
It's only hubris
if I fail.

143
00:13:23,534 --> 00:13:27,567
Remember she is a princess
of ancient blood.

144
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:31,167
When you find her you will treat her
with the utmost respect.

145
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,900
You must obey her in all things,

146
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:35,040
within reason.

147
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:36,200
Understood, sir.

148
00:13:36,267 --> 00:13:39,151
I'm counting on you, Vorenus.

149
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:44,150
You have something to say ?

150
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:48,000
Regarding Pompey Magnus,
sir, I wish to apologize.

151
00:13:48,968 --> 00:13:50,324
It was my actions

152
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,351
that brought him
here to this end.

153
00:13:53,567 --> 00:13:56,282
- If I had done my duty...
- Indeed.

154
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,901
Dismissed.

155
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:27,534
Pompey's murderer.

156
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,934
Alas, he has run away.

157
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:33,334
Find him.

158
00:14:34,701 --> 00:14:36,296
In the meantime...

159
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:38,400
these instruments

160
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,568
tabulate the money
that was borrowed

161
00:14:40,634 --> 00:14:44,434
by His Majesty's illustrious father,
Ptolemy XII.

162
00:14:44,501 --> 00:14:46,230
In the name of the republic,

163
00:14:46,231 --> 00:14:48,092
I have come to collect.

164
00:14:48,134 --> 00:14:51,600
17 thousand thousand drachma.

165
00:14:55,633 --> 00:14:57,798
17 ?

166
00:14:58,367 --> 00:15:01,167
Absurd !

167
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,033
Four, perhaps.

168
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,849
The tabulation includes all monies

169
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,995
borrowed from Pompée
and other agents of the republic

170
00:15:09,015 --> 00:15:11,567
now unable to collect.

171
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:13,801
That is not just !

172
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:15,580
Post-mortem interests
of this type are legally

173
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:17,268
entailed
to the presiding consul,

174
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:20,701
i.e.* Gaius Julius Caesar.

175
00:15:20,702 --> 00:15:20,702
* i.e. = id est = that is to say

176
00:15:20,767 --> 00:15:23,334
- It's law.
- Roman law.

177
00:15:23,801 --> 00:15:26,264
Is there some
other form of law*,

178
00:15:26,265 --> 00:15:26,265
* Egypt is not yet a Roman province (30 b.C.)
but in 63 b.C. Ptolemy XII makes allegiance
to Pompey, and in 59 b.C. is called
by Caesar consul
amicus et socius populi Romani,
("friend and ally of the people of Rome"),
that is to say vassal.

179
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,319
you wretched woman ?

180
00:15:30,934 --> 00:15:33,169
A thousand apologies.

181
00:15:33,235 --> 00:15:34,815
Forgive us.

182
00:15:40,201 --> 00:15:42,083
There !

183
00:15:42,268 --> 00:15:44,724
There's for your payment.

184
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,752
So sorry...

185
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:50,316
His Majesty forgets
He is a vassal to Rome.

186
00:15:50,434 --> 00:15:52,241
Vassal ?

187
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,080
Vassal ?
I am no vassal !

188
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:55,890
I am king !
I am...

189
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:57,568
Sit down !

190
00:16:06,067 --> 00:16:08,133
Thank you.

191
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:10,529
When can I expect payment ?

192
00:16:10,501 --> 00:16:15,201
Your Honor, we have little enough
ready coin for our own needs.

193
00:16:15,515 --> 00:16:17,610
Our tax farmers
have not been working

194
00:16:17,611 --> 00:16:18,811
as they should because...

195
00:16:19,901 --> 00:16:21,734
Because ?

196
00:16:22,767 --> 00:16:27,301
Cleopatra's foolishness has stirred
unrest in some parts.

197
00:16:27,667 --> 00:16:30,117
Nothing serious.

198
00:16:31,534 --> 00:16:35,734
Well, I do not wish
to appear unreasonable.

199
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,901
I will accept
10 thousand thousand drachma.

200
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,600
Even that amount will
take many days to collect.

201
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:44,638
In that case,

202
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:47,007
I shall have
ample time to adjudicate

203
00:16:47,042 --> 00:16:50,034
Your dispute with
princess Cleopatra.

204
00:16:50,001 --> 00:16:51,906
Excellent notion.

205
00:16:52,001 --> 00:16:54,994
But alas, who knows where
princess Cleopatra is ?

206
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,967
Do not worry about that.

207
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,900
I shall find her.

208
00:17:09,767 --> 00:17:12,134
Blood and fire !

209
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:14,600
It's as hot as Vulcan*'s dick !

210
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:14,601
* Vulcan is the god of the fire
and of the blacksmiths.
His forge is believed to be
underneath the Aetna.

211
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,934
What a dump !

212
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:25,758
Gyppo gods must be right wasters
to make a place like this.

213
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,634
Don't speak ill of the gods
in their own country.

214
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:30,817
Gerrae*.

215
00:17:30,818 --> 00:17:30,818
* = Bullshit.

216
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,010
I've seen their gods.

217
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:35,480
Titus Pullo isn't scared
of any bastard

218
00:17:35,490 --> 00:17:36,703
with a dog's head on him.

219
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:38,224
More fool you.

220
00:17:38,595 --> 00:17:41,043
These gods are old
and powerful.

221
00:17:41,568 --> 00:17:44,267
Egypt was a great nation
long before Rome.

222
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:45,920
Was it ?

223
00:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,067
Mumped it up now,
then, haven't they ?

224
00:17:54,468 --> 00:17:56,540
Why are we here, anyhow ?

225
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,800
Waiting.

226
00:17:57,851 --> 00:18:00,794
Yeah, I know we're waiting,
but for who ?

227
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:03,501
I'll know
when I see them.

228
00:18:04,034 --> 00:18:07,501
Be like that.

229
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:11,367
"Vassal," he says !

230
00:18:11,434 --> 00:18:13,568
Barbarian scum !

231
00:18:14,733 --> 00:18:16,767
It's simple extortion.

232
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:20,334
If we do not pay him,
he will put Cleopatra on the throne.

233
00:18:20,401 --> 00:18:21,834
If...

234
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,800
If he could find her.

235
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:26,800
He is a resourceful man.

236
00:18:26,867 --> 00:18:29,301
He will find her.

237
00:18:29,367 --> 00:18:32,468
She should have died
when we first caught her.

238
00:18:33,334 --> 00:18:35,277
Now it must be done.

239
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,720
She must die.

240
00:18:36,725 --> 00:18:38,340
I agree.

241
00:18:40,468 --> 00:18:42,634
My men could be
with her by nightfall.

242
00:20:36,234 --> 00:20:38,334
Tell him "wait."

243
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:44,401
Cleopatra.

244
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:46,201
Queen majesty ?

245
00:20:46,267 --> 00:20:49,734
Hutto asks to
speak with you.

246
00:20:59,867 --> 00:21:01,543
Slap me.

247
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:11,334
- Night or day ?
- Night.

248
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:14,834
He may enter.

249
00:21:21,234 --> 00:21:23,067
Majesty...

250
00:21:23,334 --> 00:21:25,733
Fresh word has come
from Alexandria.

251
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,468
Speak, worm !

252
00:21:30,501 --> 00:21:33,034
I am most deeply
sorry to say

253
00:21:33,101 --> 00:21:37,633
Majesty must prepare Herself
for Her journey to the afterlife.

254
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:41,834
When ?

255
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,167
Now.

256
00:22:13,934 --> 00:22:15,967
Say your words.

257
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:30,468
Hello, ladies.

258
00:23:31,034 --> 00:23:32,774
Attack Caesar ?

259
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,934
Are you serious ?

260
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,604
Why not ?

261
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,801
He only has
a few hundred men with him.

262
00:23:42,934 --> 00:23:45,233
How many men could you rally ?

263
00:23:49,434 --> 00:23:52,167
You would be
the liberator of Egypt.

264
00:23:52,234 --> 00:23:54,534
Your name would
live forever.

265
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,034
My mortal flesh should
be less fortunate.

266
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:58,851
Rome does not
forget an injury.

267
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,678
Forget Rome !

268
00:24:01,033 --> 00:24:03,300
Rome is doomed.

269
00:24:03,367 --> 00:24:07,934
Her people tear at
their flesh like mad dogs.

270
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,898
In ten years the city will be

271
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:11,835
a forgotten ruin.

272
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,533
Maybe so, but what
of next year ?

273
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,133
Perhaps you're right.

274
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:20,801
Ergo*,
caution is best, yes.

275
00:24:20,902 --> 00:24:20,902
* = therefore

276
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:25,520
Perhaps...
you don't have enough influence

277
00:24:25,534 --> 00:24:27,668
among the people.

278
00:24:29,701 --> 00:24:32,968
Caesar has so few men.

279
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:37,084
I could raise the whole city
with a word.

280
00:24:38,901 --> 00:24:41,217
Think on it.

281
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:47,177
Do you think I could

282
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,000
borrow Septimius
for a little while ?

283
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,968
I'd be most grateful.

284
00:24:54,433 --> 00:24:56,338
Of course.

285
00:25:05,734 --> 00:25:07,319
Messenger from Ptolemy XIII

286
00:25:07,319 --> 00:25:08,800
begs entry, sir.

287
00:25:29,667 --> 00:25:32,801
"Ptolemy the Water Bringer,
he of the two ladies,

288
00:25:32,867 --> 00:25:35,034
he of sedge and bee,
king of kings, son of Ra,

289
00:25:35,101 --> 00:25:37,535
informs His Most Grand Honor,
et cetera,

290
00:25:38,201 --> 00:25:41,867
that him who bears this message
is him that killed Pompey."

291
00:26:18,234 --> 00:26:21,067
He's handsome enough.

292
00:26:21,134 --> 00:26:24,420
Good, strong chin.

293
00:26:24,450 --> 00:26:27,118
Looks like a mean
old man to me.

294
00:26:29,901 --> 00:26:31,534
More.

295
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,867
Divinity's mortal flesh
turns green.

296
00:26:33,934 --> 00:26:35,220
Give it here.

297
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,567
She will look like a reptile
when she arrives at Alexandria.

298
00:27:18,067 --> 00:27:20,267
Weak, I call it.

299
00:27:28,467 --> 00:27:30,800
Weak, am I ?

300
00:27:30,810 --> 00:27:32,951
She knows how to beat
her slaves well enough,

301
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:33,975
but she cannot

302
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,868
throw away that pipe,

303
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,700
- and she knows it.
- Insolent dwarf.

304
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:42,200
You know nothing.

305
00:27:45,001 --> 00:27:46,634
Throw it out.

306
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,401
Throw... it out.

307
00:28:34,667 --> 00:28:36,850
Weak, am I ?

308
00:28:43,067 --> 00:28:44,788
That Gyppo princess,

309
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:47,144
now that's good cunny.

310
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,930
Her father's people
rode with Alexander*.

311
00:28:48,931 --> 00:28:48,931
* Vorenus talks about Ptolemy Ist Sôter
(367-283 av. J.C.). Lagos' son, the
historian Pausanias wrote he'd be an
illegitimate son of Philip II of Macedon
(therefore Alexander's the Great
half-brother). He grew with Alexander
and was one of his lieutenants. When
Alexander (323 b.C.), he made
several conquest around Egypt that he
had received, and started the Lagid
dynasty from which are descended
the brother-husband and the sister-wife
Ptolemy XIII and Cleopatra VII.

312
00:28:48,945 --> 00:28:50,253
You can't speak of her like that.

313
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,750
She is, though,

314
00:28:51,867 --> 00:28:53,909
and she wants me badly.

315
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,228
Should've seen her
when I done that Nubian.

316
00:28:58,250 --> 00:29:00,450
Wet as October !

317
00:29:01,867 --> 00:29:03,571
Pullo, look at me.

318
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,483
She is a princess
of royal blood.

319
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,934
You touch her,
you die.

320
00:29:07,001 --> 00:29:08,934
I'm not stupid.

321
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:10,767
I'm just saying she wants me.

322
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:50,220
Lovely.

323
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,456
Lovely !

324
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:52,700
Nothing like cold,

325
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:55,371
stinking sweat to seduce a man.

326
00:29:56,334 --> 00:29:57,350
Caesar will think himself

327
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,350
on Olympus with Aphrodite*.

328
00:29:59,351 --> 00:29:59,351
* Greek counterpart of Venus,
goddess of the beauty and love.

329
00:29:59,355 --> 00:30:01,331
Hush, piglet !

330
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:05,600
What do you know of seduction ?

331
00:30:06,667 --> 00:30:09,200
As long as Caesar is a man,

332
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,390
I will have him.

333
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,850
She seems very sure of herself.

334
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,250
I have him...

335
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:18,500
or I die.

336
00:30:20,268 --> 00:30:22,534
So I will have him.

337
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,831
May it be so, Isis.

338
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:46,051
I only wish
he were here today.

339
00:30:46,067 --> 00:30:50,030
My womb is between the flood.

340
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:55,481
A child would come
as sure as spring.

341
00:31:22,968 --> 00:31:24,667
Come.

342
00:31:27,001 --> 00:31:28,500
You, come.

343
00:31:44,634 --> 00:31:46,578
So red !

344
00:31:46,934 --> 00:31:49,020
Your Highness,
how can I be of service ?

345
00:31:53,634 --> 00:31:55,160
Leather.

346
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:57,703
Olives.
Not so bad.

347
00:32:02,634 --> 00:32:05,238
- He will do.
- Majesty commands

348
00:32:05,250 --> 00:32:06,480
you will enter her.

349
00:32:07,534 --> 00:32:08,967
I do not understand.

350
00:32:09,034 --> 00:32:11,678
You have coitus with her.

351
00:32:12,467 --> 00:32:15,534
You have it wrong.
"Coitus" means to make babies.

352
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,556
Exact !
So,

353
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:18,352
make babies.

354
00:32:23,268 --> 00:32:24,750
Don't be scared.

355
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,529
I'm not scared,

356
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:28,995
I just cannot do what you ask !

357
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:32,120
It is not...
It is not in our custom.

358
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:35,969
Roman men are not used
by women in this way.

359
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,720
Come,

360
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,416
you will enjoy it.

361
00:32:39,234 --> 00:32:41,220
My queen is an excellent lover.

362
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:14,267
What is he waiting for ?

363
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,533
He must do as he is told !

364
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:22,300
- Let me give you a hand.
- Get off !

365
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:26,534
I must ask forgiveness of Your Majesty,
but I cannot comply !

366
00:33:26,701 --> 00:33:29,101
I am no slave
to be commanded so !

367
00:33:29,168 --> 00:33:32,834
- With all respect.
- He refuses ?

368
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,522
This...

369
00:33:34,987 --> 00:33:38,642
insect refuses me ?!

370
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:42,334
You dare refuse
the daughter of a sun god ?

371
00:33:45,134 --> 00:33:48,095
Pullo ! Report immediately
to princess Cleopatra

372
00:33:48,100 --> 00:33:49,600
and do as she says !

373
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,423
- Eh ?
- You heard !

374
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:54,800
- What's going on ?
- Just go.

375
00:34:07,334 --> 00:34:10,834
Legionary Titus Pullo
reporting for duty, ma'am.

376
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:30,300
- Gods, that was something, I can tell you.
- I don't want to know.

377
00:35:31,534 --> 00:35:34,980
If you value your life,
you won't speak of it again.

378
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,669
Why ?

379
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,631
I was only obeying orders.

380
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,132
Bloody good orders, too.

381
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:42,898
What do you think Caesar will do
if he hears of it ?

382
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,498
I'm not stupid.

383
00:35:46,934 --> 00:35:49,851
I promised the princess.
I shall not speak of it.

384
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:52,120
You can't keep a secret
to save your life.

385
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,625
You've got a mouth like a drain.

386
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,220
Princess Cleopatra, sir.

387
00:36:44,267 --> 00:36:46,126
Daughter of
the two rams,

388
00:36:46,367 --> 00:36:48,968
mistress of sedge and bee !

389
00:37:32,771 --> 00:37:35,706
Well done, Majesty.

390
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:37,903
Thank you.

391
00:38:24,534 --> 00:38:29,201
Is something wrong,
little husband ?

392
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:47,067
How funny you look
in father's chair.

393
00:38:47,234 --> 00:38:49,070
I never wanted to harm you.

394
00:38:51,334 --> 00:38:53,836
Of course you did not.

395
00:38:54,267 --> 00:38:56,313
It was your gelding

396
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:58,916
led you astray, no doubt.

397
00:38:59,234 --> 00:39:02,308
- Mistress...
- It must not speak.

398
00:39:05,133 --> 00:39:07,067
It must die !

399
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:24,300
It was him...

400
00:39:26,701 --> 00:39:28,567
Not me.

401
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:31,996
He led him astray,

402
00:39:32,701 --> 00:39:34,721
not me.

403
00:39:34,801 --> 00:39:37,834
It was him !

404
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:28,675
Get in formation !

405
00:40:37,167 --> 00:40:38,683
And you, Pullo.

406
00:40:46,767 --> 00:40:48,053
Calpurnia...

407
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:55,333
She's your third wife ?

408
00:40:55,534 --> 00:40:56,941
She is.

409
00:41:02,701 --> 00:41:05,300
Has she given you a son ?

410
00:41:05,367 --> 00:41:07,567
She has not.

411
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:11,634
How sad.

412
00:41:11,701 --> 00:41:15,786
A man without sons is
a man without a future.

413
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:18,867
I never thought
of it that way.

414
00:41:20,867 --> 00:41:22,346
Sad.

415
00:41:23,567 --> 00:41:25,609
Never mind.

416
00:41:27,601 --> 00:41:30,751
Have you secured
the upriver ports ?

417
00:41:30,933 --> 00:41:33,301
You must do so immediately.

418
00:41:33,568 --> 00:41:37,134
Whoever controls
the ports controls Egypt.

419
00:41:39,434 --> 00:41:41,884
Good advice, no doubt,

420
00:41:42,100 --> 00:41:45,134
- if I wanted to control Egypt.
- Of course you do.

421
00:41:46,134 --> 00:41:48,067
Why else are you here ?

422
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:50,072
And why save me

423
00:41:50,085 --> 00:41:52,456
 so heroically from death...

424
00:41:52,501 --> 00:41:54,770
if not to use me

425
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,268
as your...

426
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:58,434
puppet queen ?

427
00:42:02,368 --> 00:42:04,601
Do you dislike the notion ?

428
00:42:04,610 --> 00:42:06,194
My wishes

429
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:07,968
are immaterial.

430
00:42:08,867 --> 00:42:11,997
You redeemed me
from captivity.

431
00:42:12,101 --> 00:42:15,801
I am your slave.

432
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:50,100
Testudo* !

433
00:44:49,901 --> 00:44:49,901
* = the turtle.
A Roman military tactic: soldiers close up
all gaps between each other and grab
their shields at the sides and above
their heads so that the formation seems
to have a shell.

434
00:45:32,494 --> 00:45:33,829
Are you well ?

435
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:34,638
Well enough

436
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:36,111
though I do not sleep.

437
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:39,300
I write very bad poetry
through the night

438
00:45:39,305 --> 00:45:41,295
and in the morning 
I give it to the cook

439
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:42,600
to stoke the kitchen fire.

440
00:45:42,605 --> 00:45:43,920
It's a form of magic.

441
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:47,160
My ill conscience
is transformed into

442
00:45:47,098 --> 00:45:49,490
roast birds and pastries.

443
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,701
You should have
no ill conscience.

444
00:45:52,076 --> 00:45:54,339
We only did what
we had to do.

445
00:45:54,915 --> 00:45:58,895
No doubt Saturn* said something
of the sort after eating his children.

446
00:45:58,896 --> 00:45:58,896
* Saturn is the father of Jupiter,
Juno, Neptun, Pluto, Hestia et Ceres.
As he feared to be dethroned by one
his children, he ate them, except
Jupiter, saved by his mother, who
grew up and made Saturn regurgitate 
his brothers and sisters.

447
00:46:00,378 --> 00:46:02,545
The question is...

448
00:46:03,344 --> 00:46:06,078
If Caesar does not
return from Egypt ?

449
00:46:06,113 --> 00:46:08,493
Caesar has escaped
tighter traps than this.

450
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,900
He has been besieged in Alexandria
the better part of a year.

451
00:46:12,324 --> 00:46:14,562
Perhaps his luck
has run out.

452
00:46:14,597 --> 00:46:17,435
Well, what fools
we shall look

453
00:46:17,964 --> 00:46:19,943
if we have kissed
the feet of a dead man.

454
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:22,200
With Caesar dead,

455
00:46:22,439 --> 00:46:23,835
that bastard Marc Antony

456
00:46:23,901 --> 00:46:26,213
will be unleashed
to do as he wants.

457
00:46:26,250 --> 00:46:27,728
Very likely,

458
00:46:27,835 --> 00:46:29,898
but it isn't a concern of mine.

459
00:46:30,016 --> 00:46:31,720
I am done with politics.

460
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:33,744
Self-pity is all very well.

461
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:36,931
I'm not unashamed myself.

462
00:46:38,067 --> 00:46:41,067
But we are still senators.

463
00:46:41,560 --> 00:46:43,952
We have responsibilities.

464
00:46:43,987 --> 00:46:46,520
I remind you we swore
an oath of loyalty.

465
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:47,787
To Caesar,

466
00:46:47,801 --> 00:46:49,895
not to Antony.

467
00:46:51,212 --> 00:46:54,321
Cato and Scipio have
raised an army in Numidia.

468
00:46:55,178 --> 00:46:57,324
If we were to
communicate with them,

469
00:46:57,359 --> 00:46:59,726
we might...
we might...

470
00:46:59,761 --> 00:47:01,367
If it isn't Cicero ?

471
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:04,311
How strange !

472
00:47:04,312 --> 00:47:07,090
I was just now thinking of you.

473
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,093
I've received some happy news,

474
00:47:10,193 --> 00:47:13,740
and my first thought was
to come and tell you two.

475
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,203
And here you are.

476
00:47:18,567 --> 00:47:20,500
What a coincidence !

477
00:47:20,867 --> 00:47:24,182
It's amusing how often
that happens, eh ?

478
00:47:24,701 --> 00:47:26,234
So I was walking
across the forum

479
00:47:26,251 --> 00:47:28,201
and thinking of
this particular woman,

480
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:30,267
who should arrive
right in front of me

481
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,848
But the thing herself.

482
00:47:33,034 --> 00:47:36,034
Savage little
Spanish creature.

483
00:47:35,600 --> 00:47:38,070
Hair down to her ass.

484
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:45,680
Everyone misjudges me, you know.

485
00:47:46,901 --> 00:47:49,101
I'm a merciful man.

486
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:51,300
I know that's not
my reputation, but

487
00:47:51,931 --> 00:47:53,991
I am.

488
00:47:55,034 --> 00:47:58,392
Now, everyone's entitled
to a few mistakes.

489
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:01,534
Gods know, I made
one or two myself.

490
00:48:03,400 --> 00:48:05,853
I've done things...

491
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,719
things I'm

492
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:10,967
ashamed to think of.

493
00:48:14,134 --> 00:48:18,054
We are, all of us,
imperfect in our way.

494
00:48:18,067 --> 00:48:19,810
Exactly.

495
00:48:19,881 --> 00:48:21,901
We are, all of us,

496
00:48:21,915 --> 00:48:23,768
imperfect.

497
00:48:28,967 --> 00:48:32,401
Give me your hands,
brother Cicero.

498
00:48:36,600 --> 00:48:39,401
With all my heart...

499
00:48:39,767 --> 00:48:41,994
I forgive you.

500
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:44,868
I don't know
what you mean.

501
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:50,558
Nothing escapes me.

502
00:48:51,433 --> 00:48:54,606
If a pigeon dies on the Aventine*,

503
00:48:54,607 --> 00:48:54,607
* One of the seven hills surrounding Rome.

504
00:48:54,620 --> 00:48:56,243
I hear of it.

505
00:48:58,868 --> 00:49:00,700
So be assured, brother,

506
00:49:00,750 --> 00:49:03,230
if I ever,
again,

507
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:05,589
hear your name

508
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:07,085
connected

509
00:49:07,809 --> 00:49:10,735
with murmurs of treachery...

510
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,400
I will cut off

511
00:49:17,467 --> 00:49:21,934
these soft, pink hands,

512
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:26,592
and nail them
to the Senate door.

513
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:45,437
Antony ?

514
00:49:45,734 --> 00:49:48,800
You said you had
happy news to tell us.

515
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:51,433
Yes.
Of course.

516
00:49:52,000 --> 00:49:54,950
A courier came from Alexandria.

517
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,468
Caesar has lifted the siege

518
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:59,825
And massacred
the armies of Ptolemy.

519
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:02,301
He is safe and sound,

520
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,037
and master of all Egypt.

521
00:50:08,434 --> 00:50:12,123
The man is
a damn prodigy, eh ?

522
00:50:29,268 --> 00:50:32,200
Atten-hut* !

523
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,801
Hail Caesar !
