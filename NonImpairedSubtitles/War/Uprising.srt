1
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,640
The bread is for Poles
on the Aryan side. Not Jews!

2
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:14,725
''On the authority
of the commissar's office. . .

3
00:00:14,887 --> 00:00:18,846
. . .23 prisoners were executed
at 1 0 this morning. ''

4
00:00:19,047 --> 00:00:20,958
These were innocent people.

5
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:22,361
I'm sick of it!

6
00:00:22,607 --> 00:00:26,282
Watching, waiting, and standing by
being passive. I won't do it anymore!

7
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:30,679
The largest armies in the world have
not been able to defeat the Nazis.

8
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:32,206
What makes you think. . .

9
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:35,882
. . .a handful of untrained Jewish
citizens with pistols will prevail?

10
00:00:36,047 --> 00:00:39,676
We can and will fight our enemy now!

11
00:00:43,087 --> 00:00:45,043
And action.

12
00:00:46,047 --> 00:00:49,278
The biggest difference between <i>Uprising</i>
and every film about the Holocaust. . .

13
00:00:52,087 --> 00:00:57,480
. . .is that in <i>Uprising,</i> Jews resist.
It's a story of armed resistance.

14
00:00:57,727 --> 00:01:01,083
And that was a story
that I had never seen.

15
00:01:01,287 --> 00:01:05,599
That interested me from
the beginning. It interests me today.

16
00:01:05,807 --> 00:01:11,677
It led me to examine a long period,
seven years now, from when I started. . .

17
00:01:11,927 --> 00:01:14,395
. . .the issue of resistance in general.

18
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:17,320
I'm a veteran of the Polish
armed services.

19
00:01:17,487 --> 00:01:19,603
Then you are a fighter, huh?

20
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:25,844
It created an interesting question:
why were the Jews labeled as passive. . .

21
00:01:26,047 --> 00:01:30,802
. . .when other victims of genocide
were never so labeled?

22
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:35,364
I don't think anybody's heard the
Rwandans described as passive. . .

23
00:01:35,607 --> 00:01:40,362
. . .or the Cambodians who were murdered
by the Khmer Rouge as passive.

24
00:01:40,607 --> 00:01:46,477
Or what happened in Bosnia-Serbia,
''passive'' was not attached.

25
00:01:46,727 --> 00:01:50,356
I kept thinking, ''Why were
Jews considered passive?''

26
00:01:51,847 --> 00:01:57,843
When you take the example of the
Warsaw Ghetto uprising, the largest. . .

27
00:01:58,047 --> 00:02:03,246
. . .single example of resistance on
every level. And you walk backwards. . .

28
00:02:03,487 --> 00:02:08,641
. . .as you get to know the people,
you experience that they all resisted.

29
00:02:08,887 --> 00:02:13,039
They resisted in the means
they had at their disposal.

30
00:02:13,287 --> 00:02:15,243
Take off your hat.

31
00:02:15,527 --> 00:02:17,165
No, thank you.

32
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:20,126
I said take off your hat.

33
00:02:20,327 --> 00:02:25,685
People wondered why more Jews
didn't rebel. That's a big question.

34
00:02:27,487 --> 00:02:32,197
How can they just go so passively into
concentration camps? Why not fight?

35
00:02:32,407 --> 00:02:37,640
There's an anecdote I heard about
thousands of Russian army officers. . .

36
00:02:37,887 --> 00:02:40,117
. . .who were marched to their death.

37
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:45,481
You know how many people were
guarding them? Two armed Germans.

38
00:02:45,727 --> 00:02:49,515
These are professional soldiers.
Why didn't they attack?

39
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:53,879
They could've killed them.
Forty people would die, maybe 50, 1 0?

40
00:02:54,087 --> 00:02:55,645
Why didn't they do it?

41
00:02:55,847 --> 00:03:00,238
You're dealing with a very
interesting psychological situation.

42
00:03:00,487 --> 00:03:05,686
It's an unfair moniker on the Jews.
The final indignity of the Holocaust.

43
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:08,640
That was something
that over time became. . .

44
00:03:08,847 --> 00:03:11,919
. . .a force behind
getting this movie made.

45
00:03:12,127 --> 00:03:15,642
We know that 300,000 Warsaw Jews. . .

46
00:03:15,927 --> 00:03:20,796
. . .have been sent to Treblinka,
a death camp, or simply murdered.

47
00:03:21,447 --> 00:03:23,438
For now, deportations have ceased.

48
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:27,356
When they resume,
we will no longer submit.

49
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:30,678
We're going to respond
with armed resistance!

50
00:03:31,047 --> 00:03:33,242
Mordechai Anielewicz,
and his friends. . .

51
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:39,046
. . .founded this resistance,
an underground movement to undermine. . .

52
00:03:39,247 --> 00:03:45,641
. . .deportations to the death camps and
to pester and kill Nazis in any way.

53
00:03:46,287 --> 00:03:48,562
It was an idealistic organization. . .

54
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:52,959
. . .with a socialist bent.
It was a true collective.

55
00:03:53,127 --> 00:03:57,598
The emphasis was on the group,
and not the individual.

56
00:03:57,807 --> 00:04:02,039
Here. In case you run
into trouble again.

57
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:05,160
We'll put a stop to this, yes?

58
00:04:05,407 --> 00:04:08,763
What moved me when I learned
about the story. . .

59
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:13,159
. . .was that these people
fought for honor.

60
00:04:13,407 --> 00:04:16,717
I felt it was so devoid
from most of our lives.

61
00:04:16,927 --> 00:04:20,886
Recently with the tragedy
at the World Trade Center. . .

62
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:25,917
. . .you saw people there behave
with great honor and great valor.

63
00:04:26,127 --> 00:04:30,518
From the firefighters, to policemen,
to ordinary citizens.

64
00:04:30,727 --> 00:04:36,563
Part of what's coming out of the ashes,
if there is a phoenix rising out. . .

65
00:04:36,807 --> 00:04:42,677
. . .it's a sense of sacrifice and of
recognition of honor on all levels.

66
00:04:42,887 --> 00:04:46,641
From the most mundane,
to the most obviously heroic.

67
00:04:46,847 --> 00:04:53,036
That moved me, that these kids decided
to fight knowing they would die.

68
00:04:53,247 --> 00:04:57,843
Once they organized and decided,
''We're going to fight to the death'' . . .

69
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:01,756
. . .they never thought any of them
would live. They thought. . .

70
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:03,480
. . .they'd go out with a bang.

71
00:05:03,687 --> 00:05:06,918
Mordechai said there's
one thing we can control. . .

72
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:10,881
. . .in this terrible Nazi situation,
and that's how we die.

73
00:05:11,127 --> 00:05:17,236
And so their deaths were all they had.
And how to use it. . .

74
00:05:17,407 --> 00:05:18,601
. . .was all they had.

75
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,235
The spirit of our deaths. . . .

76
00:05:24,527 --> 00:05:26,563
The spirit of our deaths. . .

77
00:05:26,807 --> 00:05:30,243
. . .will shape the soul
of a new generation.

78
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:33,199
A new nation of Jews.

79
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:36,843
They held them out of
the Ghetto for over a month. . .

80
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:40,926
. . .for quite a while.
Some fought for a very long time.

81
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:46,281
What's incredible is that
this young Jewish youth. . .

82
00:05:46,527 --> 00:05:52,921
. . .fought the German army, the Nazis,
longer than the entire Polish army did.

83
00:05:53,447 --> 00:05:55,961
And if other Jews are emboldened. . .

84
00:05:56,127 --> 00:06:00,439
. . .if other sectors initiate uprisings,
it spreads to the Poles--?

85
00:06:00,647 --> 00:06:04,560
You see the implications?
The cause for concern?

86
00:06:04,767 --> 00:06:09,522
An unwritten rule we followed was:
don't dramatize the Holocaust. . .

87
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:13,402
. . .just tell the story.
Let the story tell itself.

88
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:18,397
The difficult thing was finding
where the real characters intersected.

89
00:06:18,607 --> 00:06:25,046
And taking a narrative out of these
historical characters and events.

90
00:06:25,247 --> 00:06:30,321
Paul Brickman's interpretation of Adam
Czerniakow, the Jewish Council head. . .

91
00:06:30,527 --> 00:06:35,442
. . .the <i>Judenrat,</i> which is like being
the mayor of New York, if you will. . .

92
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:41,279
. . .his interpretation was that
this man did everything. . .

93
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:46,840
. . .to mitigate damages being inflicted
upon his people by the Germans.

94
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:52,917
In his hopefulness, Czerniakow tried
to create a negotiating position. . .

95
00:06:53,087 --> 00:06:57,524
. . .where he could bargain to make
the life easier until it was over.

96
00:06:57,727 --> 00:07:03,120
His mistake was that he thought
the people he was bargaining with. . .

97
00:07:03,327 --> 00:07:07,002
. . .exchanging pleasantries,
were people. They weren't.

98
00:07:07,207 --> 00:07:10,244
Strip the women naked.
This won't happen again.

99
00:07:10,647 --> 00:07:16,358
One of the interesting things
was the character Dr. Fritz Hippler. . .

100
00:07:16,607 --> 00:07:19,758
. . .who was a filmmaker
who did <i>The Eternal Jew...</i>

101
00:07:19,967 --> 00:07:23,437
. . .and who was one of the pets
of Goebbels. . .

102
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:28,357
. . .because as I did this research,
almost all of the photos that exist. . .

103
00:07:28,607 --> 00:07:33,283
. . .are actually German propaganda
photos created by Hippler's people.

104
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:38,959
It was incredible. Like I was watching
a <i>Saturday Night Live</i> skit gone awry.

105
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:42,085
But I thought portraying it
would be chilling.

106
00:07:42,287 --> 00:07:45,120
I was assigned by Goebbels to film.

107
00:07:48,727 --> 00:07:54,359
-He says the film will outlast us all.
-Victory will last! This is not it.

108
00:07:54,527 --> 00:07:56,916
Depends where you put the camera.

109
00:07:57,127 --> 00:08:01,643
His debate with General Stroop,
who is played by Jon Voight. . .

110
00:08:01,847 --> 00:08:04,919
. . .especially Stroop himself
in his diary wrote. . .

111
00:08:05,127 --> 00:08:09,120
. . .on May 1 6th, he blew up
the Tlomackie Street temple and said:

112
00:08:09,287 --> 00:08:13,758
''Warsaw is <i>judenrein.</i> Warsaw is free
of Jews. '' Which was not the case.

113
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:18,483
The Jews were living underground
and fought up to December.

114
00:08:18,727 --> 00:08:24,165
My interpretation is that Stroop lost.
If there were a Warsaw Ghetto battle. . .

115
00:08:24,407 --> 00:08:28,195
. . .the purpose was not only
to eradicate it, but get rid of leaders.

116
00:08:28,407 --> 00:08:31,444
And many did escape
and continue to fight.

117
00:08:31,647 --> 00:08:36,118
That was an interesting opportunity
to interpret that I think. . .

118
00:08:36,327 --> 00:08:39,285
. . .will shed a slightly new light,
or at least offer. . .

119
00:08:39,527 --> 00:08:44,442
. . .an opportunity for discussion among
experts about what happened there.

120
00:08:44,847 --> 00:08:45,836
Enough!

121
00:08:52,167 --> 00:08:56,285
The problems you have
to create a movie are infinite.

122
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:06,918
I had to get enough knowledge to
be able to ask people questions. . .

123
00:09:07,127 --> 00:09:10,483
. . .that wouldn't be insulting,
and be able to listen.

124
00:09:10,687 --> 00:09:13,759
And after all the information I got,
I had to. . .

125
00:09:13,967 --> 00:09:17,323
. . .pass that on to different people
making a movie.

126
00:09:17,527 --> 00:09:22,681
I met survivors in Europe,
L.A., Poland, Israel, all over. . .

127
00:09:22,927 --> 00:09:27,523
. . .just scores and scores of them.
And I became quite knowledgeable.

128
00:09:27,727 --> 00:09:34,041
Kazik was very helpful. His influence
was details, factual things. . . .

129
00:09:34,247 --> 00:09:38,479
There were kids running, people
starving, feathers floating. . . .

130
00:09:38,687 --> 00:09:43,681
You say, ''This looks incredible.
So real. All these buildings. ''

131
00:09:43,887 --> 00:09:49,086
Then you see this man standing there
and he's laughing, smiling or staring.

132
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:51,636
And you realize,
wow, he was here.

133
00:09:51,887 --> 00:09:56,881
He looked around and he pointed to
a third floor in the square and said:

134
00:09:57,127 --> 00:10:01,757
''That was my apartment. '' I think
we all had chills down our spine.

135
00:10:01,967 --> 00:10:04,401
I thought for a second or a minute. . .

136
00:10:05,727 --> 00:10:08,639
. . .that I am back in
the Warsaw Ghetto.

137
00:10:08,807 --> 00:10:14,120
It was something unbelievable.
Really, it was shocking.

138
00:10:14,927 --> 00:10:16,838
And action!

139
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:22,075
To create these bodies, these actors,
these characters. . .

140
00:10:22,327 --> 00:10:25,444
. . .was an enormous challenge
as a filmmaker.

141
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:30,562
Much of the cast wasn't Jewish.
It didn't even begin whatever it is. . .

142
00:10:30,807 --> 00:10:35,085
. . .that being a Jew is, just as
being black is or being Spanish is.

143
00:10:35,287 --> 00:10:38,245
I believe actors can play
anything, PC or not. . .

144
00:10:38,447 --> 00:10:40,358
. . .that's what I felt.

145
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:45,357
Jon Avnet was very persistent.
I said, ''I'm not Jewish. ''

146
00:10:45,527 --> 00:10:49,406
When I was in university,
I wished I was Irish or Jewish.

147
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,838
I so regretted my wretched blue eyes.

148
00:10:53,047 --> 00:10:59,202
He convinced me that I could play
that character and that I was Jewish.

149
00:10:59,407 --> 00:11:03,446
I'd say, ''Let's do this scene. ''
And they had to be ready.

150
00:11:03,687 --> 00:11:07,362
They had to be prepared.
They had to have their ideas.

151
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:12,357
If they wanted to say something,
I'd say ''Let's try that, or do this. ''

152
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,205
It was a loose feeling.

153
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:19,276
All I had to do was start them and
say go, because we did the improvs.

154
00:11:19,487 --> 00:11:22,877
They got that movement
that just feels real.

155
00:11:23,127 --> 00:11:27,279
That was so important to me
because I knew from early on. . .

156
00:11:27,487 --> 00:11:30,843
. . .I would shoot this in
a quasi-documentary style.

157
00:11:31,047 --> 00:11:35,484
It was a little frustrating to my
ADs because I wouldn't rehearse.

158
00:11:35,687 --> 00:11:38,804
I wouldn't rehearse
for the camera department.

159
00:11:39,007 --> 00:11:42,124
I'd say, ''You have to hit this.
Get in focus. ''

160
00:11:42,327 --> 00:11:47,606
Denis Lenoir, my French
cinematographer, did a fantastic job.

161
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:57,401
This story hadn't been told, partly
because it was physically difficult.

162
00:11:57,607 --> 00:12:02,920
Raffaella De Laurentiis is the genius
that put all the people together.

163
00:12:03,127 --> 00:12:06,278
It wasn't a set.
They built the Ghetto.

164
00:12:06,487 --> 00:12:10,480
They built acres of buildings
and cobblestone streets.

165
00:12:10,727 --> 00:12:15,437
-Like they were there for centuries.
-It had to be designed.

166
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:18,445
The technical drawings.
And was it feasible?

167
00:12:18,647 --> 00:12:22,765
I came up with the idea of not
building where Raffaella wanted.

168
00:12:22,927 --> 00:12:24,997
I wanted to build it in Bratislava.

169
00:12:25,167 --> 00:12:27,078
It was created for the movie. . .

170
00:12:28,647 --> 00:12:31,320
. . .because the Ghetto
wasn't this layout.

171
00:12:31,487 --> 00:12:36,038
We took one and a half months
to draw the proper building drawings.

172
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:41,486
And it took three months to build,
paint and dress the set.

173
00:12:41,727 --> 00:12:45,686
It was an extraordinary set.
It was living. It was vital.

174
00:12:45,927 --> 00:12:47,883
You saw children marching.

175
00:12:48,087 --> 00:12:52,638
They have no idea even, really,
that they're making a film.

176
00:12:52,847 --> 00:12:54,838
And that innocence. . .

177
00:12:55,087 --> 00:13:00,207
. . .of them being oblivious to what
they're doing, where they're led. . .

178
00:13:00,407 --> 00:13:03,877
. . .was the innocence and naiveté
of the children. . .

179
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,325
. . .being lead happily almost,
to their death.

180
00:13:08,527 --> 00:13:12,725
Dr. Korczak. Why are you here?
You're exempt from this order.

181
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:17,079
-What about the children?
-The children must board.

182
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:18,925
Then I will do as well.

183
00:13:19,327 --> 00:13:20,476
Action!

184
00:13:20,727 --> 00:13:24,686
There's nothing to indicate that
it isn't 1 939 in here. . .

185
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:27,043
. . .including the way I'm dressed.

186
00:13:27,247 --> 00:13:31,638
When you do a period film,
costumes give you your period.

187
00:13:31,807 --> 00:13:34,640
Along with production design
and set dressing.

188
00:13:34,807 --> 00:13:37,480
They're very important.

189
00:13:38,847 --> 00:13:40,405
But we want them to look real,
not like costumes.

190
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:43,798
It's sometimes harder to accomplish
than anything.

191
00:13:44,207 --> 00:13:47,404
Every cobblestone you see,
which we built. . .

192
00:13:47,607 --> 00:13:51,441
. . .300 meters long, four stories high,
was laid by hand.

193
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:55,526
There aren't a lot of cobblestones
in most places.

194
00:13:55,727 --> 00:13:59,436
It's important for me.
We worked under a tight budget.

195
00:13:59,647 --> 00:14:02,400
We had 73 or 74 days
to shoot the film.

196
00:14:02,607 --> 00:14:08,955
I came around a corner and saw
hundreds of people in wardrobe and. . .

197
00:14:09,207 --> 00:14:13,086
. . .horses and dogs.
I was just completely overwhelmed.

198
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:16,080
The whole set came to life.
It's incredible.

199
00:14:16,287 --> 00:14:20,565
To figure out the signage
and what the buildings look like. . . .

200
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:24,885
They had to be practical enough
to put fighters in the windows.

201
00:14:25,127 --> 00:14:27,687
I also wanted to design tie-ins. . .

202
00:14:27,927 --> 00:14:32,557
. . .where you could be in Mordechai's
lookout and see the Germans marching.

203
00:14:32,807 --> 00:14:38,916
The way that they built this set
is amazing. It's absolutely amazing.

204
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:47,880
Some stunt guys getting lit on fire.

205
00:14:48,127 --> 00:14:53,076
The camera's on him, goes to Radha,
to the kids, back to Radha, to Hank.

206
00:14:53,287 --> 00:14:56,359
They're all firing at once.
And that's one piece.

207
00:14:56,567 --> 00:15:01,163
There are four other things going on
at the same time. It's insane.

208
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:06,043
You want to be tight. Lose that one.
Get that camera over there.

209
00:15:06,247 --> 00:15:10,001
Also tight, like on a hundred,
on a flamethrower over here.

210
00:15:18,007 --> 00:15:22,285
I was having some vodka
with Kazik and Marek.

211
00:15:22,527 --> 00:15:27,237
Kazik said, ''Do you think
the Holocaust could happen again?''

212
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:31,241
I said in my typical, hopeful way,
''I hope not. ''

213
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:33,756
He said he thought it could.

214
00:15:36,407 --> 00:15:39,558
Having seen a film
or documentary about it. . .

215
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:43,766
. . .nothing can compare
to being present at it.

216
00:15:44,007 --> 00:15:50,082
It's just overwhelming to know
that this actually happened.

217
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:56,086
Mordechai was a teacher
interested in philosophy and history.

218
00:15:56,327 --> 00:16:02,163
He asked, ''How can a moral man maintain
his moral code in an immoral world?''

219
00:16:02,367 --> 00:16:05,564
Which is a relevant question
in occupied Poland.

220
00:16:05,727 --> 00:16:08,799
In the Jewish Ghetto, especially.
What do you do?

221
00:16:09,007 --> 00:16:15,321
This film must overcome to show
what is impossible to describe. . .

222
00:16:16,327 --> 00:16:21,481
. . .in the human language and
in the human situation. Impossible.

223
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:24,884
I'm not going to give up my hope.

224
00:16:25,127 --> 00:16:27,846
But I feel, unfortunately, that. . .

225
00:16:28,407 --> 00:16:34,676
. . .the question about how you live
morally in an immoral world is. . .

226
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:38,044
. . .more present than
I anticipated it to be.

227
00:16:38,287 --> 00:16:42,485
To remind people to remember
what they have not experienced.

228
00:16:42,727 --> 00:16:44,558
To force them to remember.

229
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:48,476
Jon Avnet's picture
is running parallel to that.

230
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:51,759
To force you to remember. . .

231
00:16:52,007 --> 00:16:54,077
. . .man's inhumanity to man.

232
00:16:54,287 --> 00:16:56,039
In rehearsal. . .

233
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:58,915
. . .when I saw the level
of commitment. . .

234
00:16:59,127 --> 00:17:03,678
. . .the emotional connection of actors
to the material and characters. . .

235
00:17:03,927 --> 00:17:05,679
. . .and to one another. . .

236
00:17:06,487 --> 00:17:12,244
. . .I realized we had something
that was really just special.

237
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:17,441
No matter what, we'd never have
that experience in our lives again.

238
00:17:18,007 --> 00:17:23,035
Confidence is something that's not
carried with you.

239
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:25,278
It's something that you think
you ought to have.

240
00:17:25,527 --> 00:17:29,361
And when you get into rehearsal,
you think, huh?

241
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:32,405
And when I did go into rehearsal. . .

242
00:17:32,567 --> 00:17:35,525
. . .I knew I had a chance
for a great movie.

243
00:17:35,687 --> 00:17:37,405
That's what I cared to do.

244
00:17:37,647 --> 00:17:40,241
In the simplest terms,
my goal was to. . .

245
00:17:40,487 --> 00:17:45,800
. . .be a messenger for millions
of people who had no voices.
