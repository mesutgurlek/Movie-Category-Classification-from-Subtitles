1
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:19,878
Okay, you guys, the Yanks are here.

2
00:03:19,983 --> 00:03:22,315
Don't go! It's a Jap trick!

3
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:26,218
Come on! You've been here three years!
Get out of here! Head for the main gate.

4
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,491
- Yanks!
- Take him.

5
00:03:32,595 --> 00:03:34,062
Come on, guys!

6
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,625
Come on, fellows, get to the main gate.
Get to the main gate, boys.

7
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:42,565
Hurry up. Come on, fellows.

8
00:03:42,672 --> 00:03:46,267
Go the main gate, will you?
Come on, the main gate.

9
00:03:46,376 --> 00:03:49,345
Right this way. Come on, boys.
Get over to the main gate.

10
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:52,004
- Hurry up!
- Get to the main gate, fellows.

11
00:03:52,148 --> 00:03:55,447
Keep the men under cover. Come on.

12
00:03:55,752 --> 00:03:57,743
- Here they come, Captain.
- Hurry.

13
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:19,132
Come on, men. Hurry it up.
Keep moving, men. Hurry it up.

14
00:04:19,242 --> 00:04:21,005
Come on. Hurry it up.

15
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:25,238
We'll send a man back
as soon as we're in the clear.

16
00:04:25,348 --> 00:04:28,044
- Okay, Captain. We'll take care of them.
- Right.

17
00:04:34,057 --> 00:04:36,753
Come on, give that man a hand, will you?

18
00:05:45,495 --> 00:05:48,589
- That's the first round.
- They'll be back.

19
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:01,736
- Captain.
- Yeah?

20
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:04,142
- It's all clear, you can withdraw now.
- Good.

21
00:06:04,247 --> 00:06:05,339
- Jack.
- Yes, sir?

22
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:07,075
We're pulling out.

23
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:08,842
Come on.

24
00:06:28,538 --> 00:06:30,233
<i>The men you are about to see...</i>

25
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:33,137
<i>are actual survivors</i>
<i>of three terrible years...</i>

26
00:06:33,242 --> 00:06:35,802
<i>in the Jap prison camp at Cabanatuan.</i>

27
00:07:36,405 --> 00:07:41,138
<i>For two weeks, Filipino troops have held</i>
<i>their front on Bataan without relief.</i>

28
00:07:41,244 --> 00:07:45,146
<i>And for 10 days and 10 nights, they have</i>
<i>been withstanding the unceasing attacks...</i>

29
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:48,079
<i>of Gen. Homma 's 200,000 men.</i>

30
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:49,276
Don't we know it?

31
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:54,288
<i>Why do you fight? This is not your war.</i>
<i>America brought you into it.</i>

32
00:07:54,857 --> 00:07:59,487
<i>For every American who dies on Bataan,</i>
<i>seven Filipinos shed their blood.</i>

33
00:08:00,196 --> 00:08:01,925
<i>America has abandoned you.</i>

34
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:05,262
General, what do you think
our chances are that...

35
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:08,360
That help is on its way?
Nothing we can bet on.

36
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:10,837
<i>What good is liberty to the dead?</i>

37
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:13,903
Filipinos, why do you fight?

38
00:08:14,377 --> 00:08:16,106
Look toward the sea.

39
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:19,746
Your liberators come to restore
your homes and your loved ones.

40
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,719
<i>Filipinos, look toward the sea.</i>

41
00:08:24,153 --> 00:08:28,146
Scotty, any word
on the concentration on our left?

42
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:32,091
Nothing to indicate one. But there's
time for aerial reconnaissance before dark.

43
00:08:32,195 --> 00:08:36,495
Yes, we got time, all right.
But no air corps. It burned out a bearing.

44
00:08:37,533 --> 00:08:39,728
- Get Col. Madden.
- Yes, sir.

45
00:08:41,304 --> 00:08:44,671
<i>Filipinos, why are you rotting in foxholes?</i>

46
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:49,110
<i>You have no arms.</i>
<i>You're dying by the thousands of malaria.</i>

47
00:08:49,212 --> 00:08:51,339
<i>- Your homes are being destroyed.</i>
- Col. Madden.

48
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,847
- Headquarters on the phone.
<i>- Lay down your guns.</i>

49
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:55,315
<i>Spare your homeland.</i>

50
00:08:57,954 --> 00:08:59,888
Col. Madden speaking.

51
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:03,324
They're attacking about every hour, sir,
as usual.

52
00:09:03,426 --> 00:09:07,556
Joe, something may be pulled
against your end of the line.

53
00:09:07,663 --> 00:09:10,530
Put that company
of Philippine Scouts on alert...

54
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:14,535
but don't commit them to action
unless the situation becomes desperate.

55
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:17,128
<i>- What's up, sir?</i>
- I wish I knew, Joe.

56
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:26,239
- Where's Capt. Bonifacio?
- He went to the cliffs, sir.

57
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:28,177
- Colonel, sir.
- Yes?

58
00:09:28,284 --> 00:09:31,617
That woman on the radio,
she was his sweetheart, sir.

59
00:09:32,188 --> 00:09:33,348
I know.

60
00:09:34,357 --> 00:09:35,415
- Roberts.
- Yes, sir.

61
00:09:35,524 --> 00:09:37,685
I'm going to the cliffs.
I'll be gone 10 minutes.

62
00:09:37,793 --> 00:09:39,454
- Take over.
- Yes, sir.

63
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,407
Hello, Andrés.

64
00:09:56,012 --> 00:09:59,504
- Just passing by, I suppose.
- No, I want to talk to you.

65
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,574
Won't you make yourself at home?

66
00:10:02,685 --> 00:10:05,449
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.

67
00:10:05,554 --> 00:10:09,217
I'm sorry I can't offer anything better
than these crude native cigarettes.

68
00:10:09,325 --> 00:10:10,758
That's all right.

69
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,226
I've been smoking them for years.

70
00:10:15,131 --> 00:10:17,292
- Find them to my taste.
- Good.

71
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,766
You'll forgive me
if I don't pour you a martini...

72
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:22,633
- Stop acting like a schoolboy.
- What do you mean schoolboy?

73
00:10:22,738 --> 00:10:26,367
Only a schoolboy would expose himself
and his men like you did today.

74
00:10:26,475 --> 00:10:29,638
I know it's tough when the woman
you love goes over to the enemy...

75
00:10:29,745 --> 00:10:31,940
- but you can't let...
- It's none of your business.

76
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:35,711
That's right. But risking the lives
of these men is my business.

77
00:10:35,818 --> 00:10:38,446
Keep it up and you'll have
the whole company wiped out.

78
00:10:38,554 --> 00:10:42,320
This is a dirty war we're fighting.
We've got to fight it the right way.

79
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:45,258
- What do you want me to do?
- I want you to act like a soldier.

80
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:47,454
Remember you're in command
of a company of men.

81
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:51,124
You've got the responsibility
of their lives in your hands.

82
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,359
What is it, Bernessa?

83
00:10:52,468 --> 00:10:56,199
Maj. McKinley, sir, battalion reports.
Japs are making mass attack, sir.

84
00:10:56,872 --> 00:10:59,898
Get back to your company.
Hold them on the alert.

85
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:02,807
And don't do anything
until you get orders, understand?

86
00:11:02,912 --> 00:11:04,140
Yes, sir.

87
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:09,609
By the way, for this morning's action,
I'm recommending you for the DSC.

88
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:18,051
- Colonel, sir.
- Yes, Bernessa?

89
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,355
Capt. Bonifacio, how is it with him?

90
00:11:20,463 --> 00:11:23,694
- Okay. We'll have to keep an eye on him.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:44,820
Get McKinley on the wire.

92
00:11:46,489 --> 00:11:48,616
How much ammunition
do they think we've got?

93
00:11:48,724 --> 00:11:50,658
<i>Maj. McKinley speaking.</i>

94
00:11:51,293 --> 00:11:55,286
Madden speaking. What are you guys
celebrating down there, New Year's?

95
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:59,129
- That's real ammunition you're shooting.
<i>- That's real Japs we're shooting at.</i>

96
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:02,693
At the rate you're going, you'll use up
our nine-day supply in two hours.

97
00:12:02,805 --> 00:12:05,968
<i>They're not coming over at the usual rate.</i>
<i>They're coming in waves.</i>

98
00:12:06,075 --> 00:12:08,134
McKinley, there aren't that many Japs.

99
00:12:08,244 --> 00:12:11,407
<i>Sir, I suggest you come down</i>
<i>and see for yourself.</i>

100
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,514
- Take over, Roberts.
- Yes, sir.

101
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:18,179
I am going to see for myself.

102
00:12:55,157 --> 00:12:56,647
See what I mean, sir?

103
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:21,114
They're actually bridging that barbed wire
with their bodies.

104
00:13:22,351 --> 00:13:23,978
A bridge of dead.

105
00:13:56,552 --> 00:13:59,214
- Are you all right, sir?
- I'm all right.

106
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:02,455
Didn't know there were that many Japs.

107
00:14:02,558 --> 00:14:05,152
- Where's McKinley?
- Second one got him, sir.

108
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,361
Let's get out of here!

109
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,628
- How goes it, Felipe?
- Okay, Colonel.

110
00:14:40,729 --> 00:14:42,026
<i>Filipinos.</i>

111
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:45,655
<i>This is your countrywoman</i>
<i>Dolici Dalgado speaking to you.</i>

112
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,928
<i>I speak to you from my heart.</i>

113
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:52,331
<i>Must America have the last drop</i>
<i>of your blood? Lay down your guns.</i>

114
00:14:53,208 --> 00:14:57,167
<i>The empire of Japan is waiting</i>
<i>to welcome you in...</i>

115
00:14:57,313 --> 00:15:01,750
Take it easy! We don't have ammunition
to waste on loudspeakers. Get down.

116
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:07,054
<i>Peace, prosperity, and freedom await you</i>
<i>as soon as this war ends.</i>

117
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:10,957
<i>You must not fight.</i>
<i>The odds are against you.</i>

118
00:15:11,794 --> 00:15:14,490
<i>... send more men than...</i>

119
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,257
- Hello, Carlito.
- Hello, Colonel.

120
00:15:16,398 --> 00:15:20,459
<i>... preparing for this war for years.</i>
<i>They have not yet been...</i>

121
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:23,231
- How's the arm?
- Okay, Colonel, sir.

122
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,807
Take care of it.
I'm keeping an eye on your guitar.

123
00:15:25,941 --> 00:15:26,908
Thank you, sir.

124
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:30,273
<i>The army of Gen. Homma</i>
<i>will join the battle in Bataan.</i>

125
00:15:30,579 --> 00:15:33,707
<i>Filipinos, there is no honor in this fight...</i>

126
00:15:33,849 --> 00:15:36,977
What do they call that DSC
you're getting for today's action?

127
00:15:37,119 --> 00:15:39,986
I'll trade you that medal
for one shot at the loudspeaker.

128
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:44,116
No deal. Can't always do what we like.
I've got orders to report to Corregidor.

129
00:15:44,259 --> 00:15:45,624
- What for?
- I don't know.

130
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:47,695
I'm to turn over my command
to Col. Roberts.

131
00:15:47,763 --> 00:15:51,028
- Can I go with you?
- We lost Maj. McKinley today.

132
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:53,294
You'll take over his battalion.

133
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:59,034
<i>We must work with them.</i>

134
00:15:59,174 --> 00:16:01,836
<i>We must show</i>
<i>that we are worthy of their help.</i>

135
00:16:01,944 --> 00:16:04,674
<i>We must stop this senseless war at once.</i>

136
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:10,510
- Hi, Colonel.
- Did the chow get here?

137
00:16:10,619 --> 00:16:12,280
- Yes, sir, Colonel.
- Good.

138
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,618
Andrés...

139
00:16:18,494 --> 00:16:21,657
I know every man in this outfit
by his first name.

140
00:16:21,997 --> 00:16:26,195
- I've known them since they were kids.
- Don't worry about them, Colonel.

141
00:16:27,002 --> 00:16:29,470
<i>You have your lives and your honor.</i>

142
00:16:30,105 --> 00:16:32,596
<i>Filipinos, lay down your arms.</i>

143
00:16:50,492 --> 00:16:53,154
- Col. Madden reporting, sir.
- Colonel.

144
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:59,801
- Hello, Joe.
- Hello, Skinny. It's good to see you.

145
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,129
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

146
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:05,104
- We're gonna make fast talk.
- Where's Gen. MacArthur?

147
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:08,804
How are things going
down at your end of the line, Joe?

148
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,935
We could use a little more food.

149
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:14,447
We're running out of horses and mules,
but we'll get by.

150
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,040
Sure you will.

151
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,521
- American.
- The last.

152
00:17:50,519 --> 00:17:53,352
You're building me up
for something, Skinny.

153
00:17:54,289 --> 00:17:56,883
- Let's have it.
- You're going out, Joe.

154
00:17:58,193 --> 00:18:01,924
- Where?
- To organize general guerrilla resistance.

155
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:03,791
And leave my Scouts?

156
00:18:03,899 --> 00:18:07,494
You can't do that to me, Skinny.
I've spent most of my life...

157
00:18:08,403 --> 00:18:11,998
The President just ordered
Gen. MacArthur to Australia.

158
00:18:18,313 --> 00:18:21,214
Well, then, I guess I can leave the Scouts.

159
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:26,085
I don't have to tell you what
the boys of Bataan have gone through.

160
00:18:26,221 --> 00:18:28,519
They've been bothered
especially with planes.

161
00:18:28,624 --> 00:18:30,888
They've pinned us down
until we're helpless.

162
00:18:30,993 --> 00:18:33,689
We've been combing them out of our hair.

163
00:18:34,463 --> 00:18:36,727
Anything you can do
to relieve the pressure.

164
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:38,299
We'll do the best we can.

165
00:18:38,433 --> 00:18:40,867
- Haven't got much time.
- What about men?

166
00:18:41,003 --> 00:18:44,564
You'll have to take pot luck.
There're a few men in the hills already.

167
00:18:44,673 --> 00:18:48,439
A scattering of scouts
and Philippine troops who were cut off.

168
00:18:48,610 --> 00:18:52,046
ROTC boys we couldn't equip,
and a few civilians.

169
00:18:52,848 --> 00:18:57,217
Here's a map reference to a small group
near the town of Balintawak.

170
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:00,215
You'll leave by PT boat at midnight.

171
00:19:00,355 --> 00:19:02,915
That doesn't give me time
to get back to my men, does it?

172
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:04,117
No, it doesn't.

173
00:19:04,259 --> 00:19:07,228
- I have my sergeant with me...
- Sure, take him along.

174
00:19:07,362 --> 00:19:09,353
And one thing more.

175
00:19:13,702 --> 00:19:17,035
You have a source of information
you'll have to guard at all costs.

176
00:19:17,172 --> 00:19:20,437
- It comes over Radio Manila.
- Radio Manila?

177
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:22,976
Yes, it's the girl, Dolici Dalgado.

178
00:19:23,078 --> 00:19:27,742
I know the stuff she's broadcast is poison,
but it would've gone on the air anyhow.

179
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:30,750
- She's doing more harm than Jap guns.
- Harm?

180
00:19:30,853 --> 00:19:34,016
It was a tip from her that kept
your reserve company of scouts...

181
00:19:34,122 --> 00:19:36,556
out of action and saved the whole front.

182
00:19:36,658 --> 00:19:39,923
Last night, she warned us
about Yamashita's arrival.

183
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:43,856
- That'll be good news to a friend of hers.
- Joe...

184
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:46,797
nobody knows about this
except you and me...

185
00:19:46,902 --> 00:19:48,426
now that Gen. MacArthur's gone.

186
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,538
- It'll have to stop there.
- Yes, sir.

187
00:19:50,672 --> 00:19:54,164
And the way to make contact with her
is set out in your orders.

188
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:58,144
It's vital that the guerrilla movement
be organized in case...

189
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:00,777
You won't have any trouble.

190
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,407
- They're a great people.
- They are, sir.

191
00:20:04,019 --> 00:20:06,044
- So long.
- So long, Skinny.

192
00:20:10,259 --> 00:20:11,692
Be seeing you.

193
00:20:13,262 --> 00:20:17,198
To His Excellency, Gen. Homma,
soon to be conqueror of Bataan.

194
00:20:17,332 --> 00:20:18,594
Thank you.

195
00:20:18,834 --> 00:20:23,271
If the Chief of Intelligence can spare
his beautiful companion for a moment...

196
00:20:23,372 --> 00:20:25,135
I will talk with her.

197
00:20:34,249 --> 00:20:37,116
I have heard you on the radio,
Miss Dalgado.

198
00:20:37,452 --> 00:20:40,114
I am deeply impressed
by your good sense.

199
00:20:40,255 --> 00:20:41,586
Thank you, Your Excellency.

200
00:20:41,690 --> 00:20:43,157
You may be the instrument...

201
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:46,090
of sparing your people
much unpleasantness.

202
00:20:46,295 --> 00:20:49,628
- I have worked hard for that end.
- You must continue.

203
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:54,629
The liberation of the entire Philippines
is now merely a matter of days.

204
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:58,636
- Let us hope so.
- In all confidence, Miss Dalgado...

205
00:20:59,308 --> 00:21:01,868
we Japanese look upon you Filipinos...

206
00:21:02,144 --> 00:21:04,635
as nephews and nieces.

207
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:08,981
You have been out
of our East Asia family for too long.

208
00:21:09,418 --> 00:21:14,014
We are waiting to embrace you,
to welcome you back into the fold...

209
00:21:15,090 --> 00:21:17,388
providing you behave yourselves.

210
00:21:17,993 --> 00:21:22,487
- We shall be very good, Your Excellency.
- I'm certain you will.

211
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:25,499
But remember, we are kindly...

212
00:21:26,335 --> 00:21:27,962
but not indulgent.

213
00:21:28,670 --> 00:21:32,936
We shall not hesitate
to spank the unruly ones.

214
00:21:35,410 --> 00:21:37,344
Thank you, Miss Dalgado.

215
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:08,600
The third, or American period
of occupation...

216
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:11,144
began with the Battle of Manila Bay...

217
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,248
and will be terminated
by a grant of independence...

218
00:22:14,383 --> 00:22:17,045
July 4, 1946.

219
00:22:18,153 --> 00:22:20,917
These are the main phases of our history.

220
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:24,616
What, then, was Spain's contribution
to the Philippines?

221
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:25,818
Maria?

222
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:31,466
The Spanish brought us the holy faith,
the Blessed Virgin, and the saints.

223
00:22:31,800 --> 00:22:35,236
Quite right, Maria.
The Spaniards brought us Christianity.

224
00:22:35,337 --> 00:22:38,101
And, now, what would you say
America gave the Philippines?

225
00:22:38,206 --> 00:22:39,230
- Soda pop.
- Hot dogs!

226
00:22:39,341 --> 00:22:40,330
- Movies.
- Radio.

227
00:22:40,442 --> 00:22:41,409
Baseball!

228
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,844
Perhaps the first of my pupils
has a better answer.

229
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,815
<i>Senor</i> Bello.

230
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,216
America taught us that men are free,
or they are nothing.

231
00:22:57,192 --> 00:23:00,719
Since then, we have walked
with high heads among all men.

232
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:05,299
Thank you, <i>Senor</i> Bello.
At first, Filipinos did not feel that way.

233
00:23:05,534 --> 00:23:09,868
They resisted the American occupation.
And then what happened? Theresa?

234
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:11,666
- We were beaten.
- We were not.

235
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:13,764
Americans cannot beat Filipinos.

236
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,867
My brother, Ramon
licked every American in the USA...

237
00:23:17,412 --> 00:23:19,073
at 118 pounds.

238
00:23:19,181 --> 00:23:21,775
Facts, Maximo. We must stick to facts.

239
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:25,784
I seem to recall that Ramon lost his fight
for the championship.

240
00:23:25,887 --> 00:23:27,354
We was robbed.

241
00:23:29,191 --> 00:23:32,422
Perhaps, Maximo, I should ask you
about a Filipino who was not beaten.

242
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:34,586
What were the last words
of Gen. Del Pilar...

243
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:36,890
to those who left him behind?

244
00:23:40,869 --> 00:23:42,097
"I am..."

245
00:23:42,504 --> 00:23:45,735
"I am surrounded by fearful odds...

246
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:49,742
"that will overcome me
and my gallant men.

247
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,412
"But I am well pleased with the thought...

248
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:56,746
"that I die fighting for my beloved country.

249
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:02,450
"Go you into the hills
and defend it to the death."

250
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,882
- Is this everybody?
- Yes, sir.

251
00:24:36,825 --> 00:24:40,158
I was told I'd find
some Philippine Scouts among you.

252
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:44,323
Cpl. Cruz, 26th Cavalry,
Philippine Scouts, reporting, sir.

253
00:24:44,432 --> 00:24:46,525
Good, Corporal. Anyone else?

254
00:24:48,837 --> 00:24:52,238
- Where are you men from?
- Mostly from Balintawak, sir.

255
00:24:52,507 --> 00:24:54,099
Ever handle guns?

256
00:24:57,445 --> 00:25:00,642
- Just bolos?
- Our fathers used them well.

257
00:25:00,949 --> 00:25:02,507
How well I know.

258
00:25:03,285 --> 00:25:07,688
I guess you understand we're taking on
a job that would be tough for trained men.

259
00:25:07,822 --> 00:25:10,814
We're gonna blow up a gasoline dump
on a Japanese airfield...

260
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:13,019
50 miles the other side of Balintawak.

261
00:25:14,062 --> 00:25:16,997
There will be from 400 to 500 Japs
on the field.

262
00:25:17,132 --> 00:25:19,600
- How many?
- 400 or 500.

263
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,499
A mere trifle, like we say.

264
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:29,338
We'll start tonight after dark.

265
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:32,413
That ought to put us at the airfield
by dark tomorrow night.

266
00:25:32,514 --> 00:25:36,575
Between now and sundown,
Sgt. Bernessa will give you instructions.

267
00:25:36,685 --> 00:25:39,848
Listen to him carefully
and do exactly as he says.

268
00:25:40,488 --> 00:25:42,183
- Take over, Sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

269
00:25:52,234 --> 00:25:53,861
Things look rough?

270
00:25:54,936 --> 00:25:56,426
A little rough.

271
00:25:57,372 --> 00:25:59,567
In that case, smell this stew.

272
00:26:03,345 --> 00:26:05,040
Go ahead, smell it.

273
00:26:07,749 --> 00:26:10,047
Ever smell anything better than that
in your life?

274
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,243
Never.

275
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:14,285
In that case, taste it.

276
00:26:23,932 --> 00:26:26,093
Why, it's a masterpiece, Bindle.

277
00:26:26,368 --> 00:26:29,030
You taste there
the fruits of two days' panhandling.

278
00:26:29,137 --> 00:26:31,901
All of which goes to prove
that nothing is wasted.

279
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,999
People could look at me and say,
"Bindle Jackson, hobo."

280
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:39,376
But without 20 years' experience on the
road, could I make up a mulligan like that?

281
00:26:39,481 --> 00:26:42,348
- Never.
- Now, if I could only shoot.

282
00:26:48,923 --> 00:26:53,383
Colonel, strictly from a point of view
of scientific curiosity...

283
00:26:53,495 --> 00:26:55,963
what would you say our chances are?

284
00:26:56,498 --> 00:27:01,094
- Of blowing up the dump or getting back?
- Both, especially the latter.

285
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:03,568
- Fair.
- Fair?

286
00:27:03,672 --> 00:27:05,435
You wouldn't say good?

287
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,008
Not if you want me to tell you
what I think.

288
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:10,535
Very interesting, isn't it?

289
00:27:10,645 --> 00:27:15,207
Not, come to think about it, that I have
any seriously pressing engagements.

290
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:20,013
- Colonel, did you have a good life?
- Fine life, Bindle.

291
00:27:22,257 --> 00:27:24,555
Especially here on the islands.

292
00:27:25,327 --> 00:27:27,386
- And you?
- I can't complain.

293
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:31,794
You know,
that's the worst part about war.

294
00:27:31,933 --> 00:27:34,731
You meet somebody,
you get to know them...

295
00:27:35,036 --> 00:27:36,663
wham, you never see them again.

296
00:27:36,771 --> 00:27:39,899
You see something,
but you never know how it ends.

297
00:27:40,275 --> 00:27:43,438
Be nice to know right now
how all this is going to end, wouldn't it?

298
00:27:45,947 --> 00:27:47,346
It certainly would.

299
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:54,784
You will bow to the Japanese officer
as representative of His lmperial Majesty!

300
00:27:56,424 --> 00:27:57,550
Lower!

301
00:27:59,294 --> 00:28:03,321
Fellow Orientals, the hand
of His lmperial Majesty, the Emperor...

302
00:28:04,366 --> 00:28:06,527
has put an end to your domination...

303
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:09,501
by an exploiting and arrogant
American race.

304
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:15,974
It will next put an end
to a system of education...

305
00:28:16,077 --> 00:28:19,342
designed to impress upon you
a sense of inferiority.

306
00:28:22,717 --> 00:28:24,184
<i>Senor</i> Bello...

307
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,383
step forward, please.

308
00:28:29,724 --> 00:28:33,251
As principal of this school,
you will haul down the flag.

309
00:28:55,383 --> 00:28:58,978
Unless you haul down the flag,
you will hang in its place.

310
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:12,724
You contempt...

311
00:29:13,535 --> 00:29:17,699
- For the last time, <i>Senor</i> Bello.
- <i>Senor</i> Bello, haul down the flag.

312
00:29:17,806 --> 00:29:22,243
I speak to you in the name of every man,
woman, and child in the United States.

313
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:45,025
- All right, Bernessa.
- Yes, sir?

314
00:29:45,133 --> 00:29:47,397
- Let's get under way.
- Yes, sir.

315
00:29:54,242 --> 00:29:55,607
Break it up.

316
00:30:05,487 --> 00:30:08,923
He was so little. Not a healthy child.

317
00:30:10,658 --> 00:30:14,719
He hated Americans because his father
had fought with Aguinaldo.

318
00:30:16,331 --> 00:30:17,992
It is Miss Barnes.

319
00:30:18,199 --> 00:30:19,928
I gave him an apple.

320
00:30:20,335 --> 00:30:22,633
It was the first he'd ever seen.

321
00:30:23,771 --> 00:30:25,830
And then we became friends.

322
00:30:31,145 --> 00:30:33,807
- Here, lady, you'd better sit down.
- No.

323
00:30:39,654 --> 00:30:42,680
- What happened?
- The Japs came into Balintawak.

324
00:30:44,025 --> 00:30:45,890
He was not a brave man.

325
00:30:46,961 --> 00:30:49,429
He was too terrified even to speak.

326
00:30:49,731 --> 00:30:52,894
But when they ordered him
to haul down our flag...

327
00:30:53,001 --> 00:30:55,162
he could only shake his head.

328
00:30:57,005 --> 00:30:59,098
And then they hanged him...

329
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:04,505
in the schoolyard,
in the presence of his pupils.

330
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:07,808
It was a bad thing to look at.

331
00:31:15,356 --> 00:31:17,688
I am Miss Barnes, schoolteacher.

332
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:21,822
- Who are you and what is your rank?
- Col. Madden, ma'am.

333
00:31:21,930 --> 00:31:25,297
Colonel, is it? Then I'm sure you'll know
what must be done.

334
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:29,461
When you attack the village, I want you to
attend especially to the Japanese Captain.

335
00:31:29,571 --> 00:31:33,098
- It was he who gave the order.
- We're not attacking the village.

336
00:31:33,207 --> 00:31:35,505
You're an American, are you not?

337
00:31:36,077 --> 00:31:38,944
It was your flag he refused to lower,
not his.

338
00:31:39,047 --> 00:31:40,912
The village isn't much out of our way.

339
00:31:41,015 --> 00:31:43,882
Our only chance of getting to
the gasoline dump is by surprise.

340
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:46,249
- Yes, but...
- The moment we'd attack that village...

341
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:48,618
the whole countryside
would be on the alert.

342
00:31:48,723 --> 00:31:51,317
I'm thinking of 70,000 men on Bataan.

343
00:31:52,894 --> 00:31:55,260
How do you fellows feel about it?

344
00:31:56,197 --> 00:31:57,596
We think you're right.

345
00:31:57,732 --> 00:32:00,530
Are you proposing
to leave this crime unavenged?

346
00:32:00,635 --> 00:32:03,604
We fight for the Philippines,
not for revenge.

347
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:04,967
- Bernessa?
- Yes, sir?

348
00:32:05,073 --> 00:32:07,541
- We're moving out immediately.
- Yes, sir.

349
00:32:07,642 --> 00:32:11,476
You stay here with Miss Barnes.
You'll find food and blankets in the lean-to.

350
00:32:11,579 --> 00:32:14,742
- Take good care of her till we get back.
- Take care of her, indeed.

351
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:18,478
- Do you think I'd stay here for a moment?
- You can't go back to the village.

352
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:20,850
Furthermore, young man,
I am not accustomed...

353
00:32:20,955 --> 00:32:23,856
to being ordered about
by every young popinjay in uniform.

354
00:32:23,958 --> 00:32:26,984
- The men are ready, sir.
- Goodbye, Miss Barnes.

355
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:28,759
Colonel...

356
00:32:29,797 --> 00:32:32,664
you really are not returning to the village?

357
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,165
Really not.

358
00:32:34,636 --> 00:32:37,867
Then I shall give you
Buenaventura Bello's epitaph.

359
00:32:37,972 --> 00:32:41,635
Someday you may come back
into the village of Balintawak again...

360
00:32:41,743 --> 00:32:43,768
and put it over his grave.

361
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:49,775
"The place matters not-
cypress or laurel or lily white

362
00:32:50,618 --> 00:32:52,711
"Scaffold or open plain

363
00:32:53,254 --> 00:32:55,552
"combat or martyrdom's plight"

364
00:32:56,891 --> 00:33:00,520
Those words were written by José Rizal,
the Philippines' greatest hero...

365
00:33:00,628 --> 00:33:03,791
on the night before he was executed
by the Spaniards.

366
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:08,001
Remember those words.
Carry them in your heart...

367
00:33:08,302 --> 00:33:12,204
so that wherever men fight for freedom,
there it may be said:

368
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:15,202
"Here lies Buenaventura Bello...

369
00:33:15,777 --> 00:33:17,938
"schoolteacher of Balintawak."

370
00:33:28,456 --> 00:33:29,821
- Colonel?
- Yes?

371
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:31,892
What would you think
our chances are now?

372
00:33:31,993 --> 00:33:34,257
- Good.
- Funny thing. So would I.

373
00:34:01,222 --> 00:34:04,214
Hold it up. There's Mt. Mariveles ahead.

374
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,654
We ought to be about two hours
from the airfield.

375
00:34:06,761 --> 00:34:09,321
We better split up. Check your watch.

376
00:34:15,269 --> 00:34:18,466
- That is Mt. Mariveles, isn't it?
- Yes, sir.

377
00:34:18,573 --> 00:34:20,768
We should be hearing gunfire from Bataan.

378
00:34:20,875 --> 00:34:22,103
Yes, sir.

379
00:34:23,878 --> 00:34:25,368
- Cruz?
- Yes, sir.

380
00:34:25,713 --> 00:34:28,113
Hold this group here,
and keep them under cover.

381
00:34:28,216 --> 00:34:31,083
Bring along four men.
We'll take a look-see.

382
00:35:49,697 --> 00:35:50,891
Scouts.

383
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:20,083
Give me a hand.

384
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:32,303
- Bernessa.
- Yes, sir?

385
00:36:32,406 --> 00:36:33,998
- Post some guards.
- Yes, sir.

386
00:36:39,513 --> 00:36:41,640
- What happened?
- Bataan has fallen.

387
00:36:43,818 --> 00:36:46,582
Seventy thousand men.
How could it happen?

388
00:36:46,721 --> 00:36:48,348
- We're beaten.
- The Japs have beaten us.

389
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,583
Hunger and sickness beat us, not the Japs.

390
00:36:50,725 --> 00:36:54,786
Then why didn't America send food
and medicine? Why didn't America help?

391
00:36:57,732 --> 00:37:00,758
Maybe you can still get away, sir.
There is no more army here.

392
00:37:00,902 --> 00:37:03,700
Now the fighting will be done in Australia.

393
00:37:04,872 --> 00:37:07,272
Maybe there will be fighting here.

394
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:10,876
- Maybe the people will wanna fight.
- Sure. The people will fight.

395
00:37:11,012 --> 00:37:13,708
Against thousands of Japs,
after they've beaten our armies?

396
00:37:13,814 --> 00:37:16,510
We have fought that way before.
We've never been conquered.

397
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:18,516
With bolos against machine guns?

398
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:21,121
If a schoolteacher
can die for the American flag...

399
00:37:21,255 --> 00:37:23,052
we can fight for the Philippines.

400
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:26,217
We must have a hope.
We cannot die for nothing.

401
00:37:27,094 --> 00:37:29,255
You remember the name
Andrés Bonifacio?

402
00:37:29,363 --> 00:37:30,728
Every Filipino does.

403
00:37:30,865 --> 00:37:33,732
If he were alive and sent out a call,
would the people answer?

404
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:36,860
- Bonifacio's dead.
- But his grandson is alive...

405
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:38,728
among those prisoners.

406
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,610
Maybe we'll be able to find him, sir.

407
00:39:03,524 --> 00:39:05,116
For you, Captain.

408
00:39:47,835 --> 00:39:51,498
- All right, set him down.
- Don't. Take him into the lean-to.

409
00:39:51,605 --> 00:39:54,039
Put him down carefully.
He's a very sick man.

410
00:39:55,609 --> 00:39:57,543
Which one of you men
calls himself the cook?

411
00:39:57,645 --> 00:39:59,977
- Me.
- I shall want some hot water first.

412
00:40:00,081 --> 00:40:02,276
Then some clear broth.
Do you know how to make it?

413
00:40:02,383 --> 00:40:04,180
Don't pretend you do if you don't.

414
00:40:04,285 --> 00:40:07,311
Good. Hurry off.
Maximo, get these men some water.

415
00:40:07,455 --> 00:40:09,685
- Can't you see they're thirsty?
- Yes, ma'am.

416
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:15,322
Cook, that's a petticoat you're gaping at.
You've seen a petticoat before.

417
00:40:15,463 --> 00:40:18,523
- Yes, but not lately.
- Hurry with the broth.

418
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:25,571
- Who is he?
- He's the grandson of Andrés Bonifacio.

419
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:29,202
No wonder you carried him so carefully.

420
00:40:31,245 --> 00:40:33,440
Those men are waiting for you.

421
00:40:39,453 --> 00:40:41,921
- Where are you from?
- From the north. Lingayen.

422
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:44,320
- I've come to fight.
- We come from Batangas.

423
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:48,020
- We've come to fight, too.
- Good. Plenty of fighting to be done.

424
00:40:48,162 --> 00:40:51,131
- Do you bring any news?
- They say the Japs have taken Bataan.

425
00:40:51,265 --> 00:40:55,167
- I know. How about Corregidor?
- They don't say about Corregidor.

426
00:40:56,203 --> 00:40:59,138
You men can do the most good
if you go back to your barrios...

427
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,231
and tell them
that the war hasn't ended yet.

428
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,900
And now the people must fight.
We need men.

429
00:41:04,011 --> 00:41:05,535
We have no arms.

430
00:41:07,148 --> 00:41:09,446
- Where did you get this?
- Killed a Jap.

431
00:41:09,550 --> 00:41:11,916
Kill more Japs and get more guns.

432
00:41:12,353 --> 00:41:15,254
When you have men and arms,
send your leaders to me.

433
00:41:15,356 --> 00:41:16,948
You'll know where we are.

434
00:41:17,458 --> 00:41:18,322
Good luck.

435
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,492
- Thank you.
- Be careful.

436
00:41:21,162 --> 00:41:24,757
We'll drive all the Japs out.
We'll chase them out of Balintawak.

437
00:41:24,865 --> 00:41:26,662
Sure you will, Maximo.

438
00:41:27,001 --> 00:41:31,802
Hurry to the village and try to find eggs.
Don't forget those papers. Hurry now.

439
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:37,669
You know what this will mean
for the people? Reprisals and terror.

440
00:41:37,811 --> 00:41:40,143
It's always been an all-out war.

441
00:41:40,481 --> 00:41:42,244
Now there's no pretense about it.

442
00:41:42,349 --> 00:41:45,250
You can't inflict this on them.
They've suffered too much.

443
00:41:45,352 --> 00:41:48,810
I'm gonna make arrangements
for you to leave the island.

444
00:41:49,290 --> 00:41:53,056
Leave? You can't ask me to leave.
My children are here, my work.

445
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,355
Do you know what they do to guerrillas?

446
00:41:55,462 --> 00:41:57,896
If Filipino women can endure it, I can.

447
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:00,057
- No, I'm afraid...
- Besides...

448
00:42:00,167 --> 00:42:03,762
you need someone to nurse him.
At least until he's better.

449
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:07,170
We'll see.

450
00:42:11,145 --> 00:42:14,876
- You spoke of an epitaph for <i>Senor</i> Bello.
- Yes, I did.

451
00:42:14,982 --> 00:42:18,110
Get it ready.
We're going into Balintawak tonight.

452
00:42:56,390 --> 00:42:58,085
Col. Roberts?

453
00:42:58,859 --> 00:43:01,555
Last time I saw him he was still alive.

454
00:43:02,963 --> 00:43:04,828
How about Delfonso?

455
00:43:05,532 --> 00:43:09,400
He was in pretty bad shape.
He's still going.

456
00:43:11,071 --> 00:43:15,337
There was a rumor about taking
our entire outfit to the same prison camp.

457
00:43:15,442 --> 00:43:18,809
- You haven't eaten a thing.
- Sorry, ma'am, I'm not hungry.

458
00:43:18,912 --> 00:43:21,881
You can't get your strength back
if you don't eat something.

459
00:43:21,982 --> 00:43:25,145
Here's some real chicken broth.
If you knew the trouble we went...

460
00:43:25,252 --> 00:43:26,719
Sorry, ma'am.

461
00:43:29,290 --> 00:43:31,622
I don't know what I'm going to do
with him.

462
00:43:31,725 --> 00:43:34,319
- Have you seen Maximo?
- He hasn't come back yet.

463
00:43:34,428 --> 00:43:36,692
I can't imagine what's happened to him.

464
00:43:36,797 --> 00:43:40,392
And José Lopez and Tomas Rinaldo,
they left for Balintawak yesterday.

465
00:43:40,534 --> 00:43:42,832
And they haven't come back yet.

466
00:43:43,304 --> 00:43:46,137
He just won't eat. I don't understand it.

467
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:48,231
He's been through
a pretty rough experience.

468
00:43:48,342 --> 00:43:52,210
Yes, but his pulse is normal,
his eyes are clear. What is his trouble?

469
00:43:52,313 --> 00:43:55,077
- Among other things, a woman.
- A woman?

470
00:43:55,349 --> 00:43:57,909
This certainly is not the time
for that sort of thing.

471
00:43:58,018 --> 00:44:01,852
- He's got to get her out of his mind.
- Sometimes it isn't that easy.

472
00:44:04,525 --> 00:44:06,789
So we spend the winter in Palm Beach.

473
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:08,987
- Doing what?
- Taking it easy.

474
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:11,796
- Have either of you seen Maximo?
- No, ma'am.

475
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,925
- Or José Lopez, or Tomas Rinaldo?
- No, ma'am.

476
00:44:19,006 --> 00:44:20,871
Let's see. Now where were we?

477
00:44:20,974 --> 00:44:24,239
Taking it easy
in Palm Beach, Florida, U.S.A.

478
00:44:24,345 --> 00:44:27,542
Yes. So we spend the winter in Florida.

479
00:44:27,648 --> 00:44:31,277
Then we hop a train, a streamliner,
mind you. Nothing but the best for us.

480
00:44:31,385 --> 00:44:35,185
- We still don't buy any ticket for this train?
- Who buys tickets?

481
00:44:35,289 --> 00:44:38,622
We hop off at New York
in time for the opening ball game...

482
00:44:38,726 --> 00:44:41,126
- we crash a few shows.
- Say, Joe...

483
00:44:41,562 --> 00:44:43,530
- Yes?
...when do we work?

484
00:44:43,630 --> 00:44:47,760
- Never.
- I sure am going to like the USA.

485
00:44:48,902 --> 00:44:51,735
Say, where you been?
Picklepuss has been looking for you.

486
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,500
Okay.

487
00:44:54,007 --> 00:44:57,101
I know a place in New York
where they make hot dogs a foot long.

488
00:44:57,211 --> 00:44:58,701
- A whole foot long?
- Yeah.

489
00:44:58,812 --> 00:45:01,280
- With relish and mustard?
- The works.

490
00:45:02,182 --> 00:45:05,674
Maybe you're wondering at this point
how we get money to pay for these.

491
00:45:05,786 --> 00:45:10,155
There's ways and means of getting money
without working. Strictly legal, mind you.

492
00:45:10,257 --> 00:45:12,020
Where have you been?

493
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:15,622
The idea of a grown man
talking like that before these boys.

494
00:45:15,729 --> 00:45:17,924
- What have you there?
- A radio.

495
00:45:18,432 --> 00:45:19,592
Radio?

496
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:26,670
Colonel, look, a radio.

497
00:45:27,941 --> 00:45:32,207
- Where'd you pick it up, in Balintawak?
- No, I stole it from the Japs.

498
00:45:33,213 --> 00:45:37,479
<i>... then every man, woman, and child</i>
<i>in the district will be wiped out.</i>

499
00:45:37,584 --> 00:45:39,814
<i>Filipinos, do not resist.</i>

500
00:45:40,387 --> 00:45:44,323
<i>For every Japanese life,</i>
<i>we pay with 10 Filipino lives.</i>

501
00:45:44,458 --> 00:45:49,191
<i>Sixty Filipinos were executed today.</i>
<i>I now read a list of the names...</i>

502
00:45:49,296 --> 00:45:52,629
<i>of those who paid with their lives</i>
<i>for the recent disorders.</i>

503
00:45:52,733 --> 00:45:56,328
<i>In Balintawak, for the murder</i>
<i>of four Japanese officers...</i>

504
00:45:56,437 --> 00:45:58,632
<i>40 Filipinos were executed.</i>

505
00:45:58,739 --> 00:45:59,763
Forty men.

506
00:45:59,873 --> 00:46:02,637
<i>Tomas Rinaldo, age 28.</i>

507
00:46:03,277 --> 00:46:05,905
<i>Felipe Luiz, age 16.</i>

508
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,978
<i>Juan Dios, age 30.</i>

509
00:46:09,783 --> 00:46:12,149
<i>Pablo Quincaro, age 19.</i>

510
00:46:13,086 --> 00:46:15,953
<i>- Ramon Cuenca, age 35...</i>
- That's my father.

511
00:46:16,924 --> 00:46:18,755
They killed my father!

512
00:46:57,764 --> 00:46:59,698
The war hurts everybody.

513
00:47:01,935 --> 00:47:05,371
Rest a while, and then
we'll send you back to Balintawak.

514
00:47:05,472 --> 00:47:07,099
Your mother'll need you.

515
00:47:07,207 --> 00:47:10,142
But I'm coming back. You said I could.

516
00:47:13,881 --> 00:47:15,212
Sure, Maximo.

517
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:23,082
<i>... submarines have been reported</i>
<i>in the Gulf of Mexico...</i>

518
00:47:23,190 --> 00:47:25,249
<i>where they sank two American vessels.</i>

519
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,919
<i>In Burma, British-Chinese forces</i>
<i>continue to withdraw...</i>

520
00:47:28,028 --> 00:47:29,791
<i>up the Irrawaddy river towards Bhamo.</i>

521
00:47:29,897 --> 00:47:33,196
<i>Last night, after six days of</i>
<i>ceaseless cannonading by the Japanese...</i>

522
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:35,200
<i>the fortress of Corregidor in Manila Bay...</i>

523
00:47:35,302 --> 00:47:37,566
<i>and satellite forts,</i>
<i>Hughes, Drum, and Frank...</i>

524
00:47:37,671 --> 00:47:41,437
<i>were surrendered at 11 p.m.</i>
<i>by Lt. Gen. Jonathan Wainwright.</i>

525
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,608
- The news is a little tough.
- Tough?

526
00:48:16,710 --> 00:48:18,337
We're licked, Joe.

527
00:48:18,679 --> 00:48:20,977
Licked? When is a nation licked?

528
00:48:21,582 --> 00:48:25,643
Military textbooks say a war is over
when the objectives are taken.

529
00:48:25,752 --> 00:48:28,585
The United States
fought your grandfather.

530
00:48:28,689 --> 00:48:31,487
- We found the textbooks were wrong.
- Were they?

531
00:48:31,592 --> 00:48:33,787
You fought off the Spaniards
for over 300 years...

532
00:48:33,894 --> 00:48:35,259
Then the American came.

533
00:48:35,362 --> 00:48:38,661
And a handful of revolutionaries,
calling themselves the Katipunan...

534
00:48:38,765 --> 00:48:40,596
took everything we could throw at them.

535
00:48:40,701 --> 00:48:43,169
Fought us to a standstill
with bolos and clubs.

536
00:48:43,270 --> 00:48:45,033
Now the Jap is here.

537
00:48:45,339 --> 00:48:48,570
What would've happened
if we hadn't fought the Spaniard...

538
00:48:48,675 --> 00:48:51,143
if my grandfather
hadn't called out the Katipunan?

539
00:48:51,244 --> 00:48:53,678
- You'd be slaves.
- What are we now?

540
00:48:55,315 --> 00:48:58,580
I've been doing a lot of thinking
these last few days.

541
00:48:58,685 --> 00:49:02,485
I wondered why you saved me
out of all those thousands of prisoners.

542
00:49:02,789 --> 00:49:05,587
- You picked the wrong guy.
- I picked Andrés Bonifacio.

543
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:10,026
I know you did. Now you expect him
to spread the word that Bonifacio's back.

544
00:49:10,130 --> 00:49:12,621
To arms, Filipinos.
Remember the Katipunan.

545
00:49:12,733 --> 00:49:16,430
Kill the Japs, even if it means
you'll be killed 10-to-1, 20-for-1.

546
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:19,505
When there are no more men,
then women and children, uselessly.

547
00:49:19,606 --> 00:49:22,541
- Uselessly?
- You know that alone we're helpless.

548
00:49:22,643 --> 00:49:25,305
Where are all those American warships
we were promised?

549
00:49:25,412 --> 00:49:27,175
Where are those American guns
and planes?

550
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,271
Why didn't they come
to Bataan and Corregidor?

551
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:30,372
I don't know.

552
00:49:30,484 --> 00:49:32,452
- Can you promise they'll come back?
- I can't.

553
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,986
Now you want me to urge them on
to more slaughter!

554
00:49:35,088 --> 00:49:37,955
It's easy for you. They're not your people.

555
00:49:39,459 --> 00:49:41,120
I don't mean that, Joe.

556
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:44,493
I know you're a better Filipino than I am.

557
00:49:46,299 --> 00:49:48,631
Maybe you should've left me prisoner.

558
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:51,397
It's just that we've taken too much
these last few months.

559
00:49:51,505 --> 00:49:52,597
Sure.

560
00:49:52,873 --> 00:49:56,365
A guy can only take so much,
then he loses something.

561
00:49:56,677 --> 00:49:57,974
I know.

562
00:49:58,545 --> 00:50:00,240
I've seen too much.

563
00:50:01,748 --> 00:50:05,775
We really don't know whether
the Americans are coming back or not.

564
00:50:06,453 --> 00:50:10,446
A guy's got to have something he wants
to live for before he can ask others to die.

565
00:50:10,557 --> 00:50:11,615
Sure.

566
00:50:12,659 --> 00:50:16,095
After a while you lose something.

567
00:50:18,799 --> 00:50:21,267
Do you feel strong enough
to go to Manila?

568
00:50:21,368 --> 00:50:23,802
- Trying to get rid of me?
- Yes. You don't belong here.

569
00:50:23,904 --> 00:50:24,962
I'm willing to fight.

570
00:50:25,072 --> 00:50:28,337
In this kind of war, you got to
believe in what you're fighting for.

571
00:50:28,442 --> 00:50:31,275
Maybe if you go to Manila,
you'll find something...

572
00:50:31,378 --> 00:50:34,370
- that'll change your mind. Will you go?
- Sure.

573
00:50:34,848 --> 00:50:37,681
I want to get a message through.
I've got a contact there.

574
00:50:37,784 --> 00:50:39,342
We'll get you a monk's robe.

575
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:43,150
You'll go to the chapter house
of the Dominicans. Ask for the prior.

576
00:50:43,390 --> 00:50:45,290
Tell him you want to hear a confession.

577
00:50:52,099 --> 00:50:55,296
...to intercede for the soul
of Andrés Bonifacio...

578
00:50:55,502 --> 00:50:57,470
who has passed from this world.

579
00:50:57,571 --> 00:51:00,472
May he be set
in a region of peace and light...

580
00:51:00,574 --> 00:51:04,271
through our Lord and Savior,
Jesus Christ. Amen.

581
00:51:44,317 --> 00:51:46,444
You have come from the prior?

582
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,082
- Andrés.
- Dolici?

583
00:51:55,395 --> 00:51:56,760
Is it Dolici?

584
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,799
I thought you were dead.

585
00:52:01,168 --> 00:52:03,261
Andrés, they are watching us.

586
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,998
- Be careful.
- I must look at you.

587
00:52:06,206 --> 00:52:07,400
Don't.

588
00:52:08,041 --> 00:52:11,533
There must be some place
we can talk and see each other.

589
00:52:15,048 --> 00:52:18,279
- Dolici, you haven't gone?
- No. I'm trying to think.

590
00:52:18,919 --> 00:52:21,217
There's a little park behind the church.

591
00:52:21,354 --> 00:52:24,790
Wait a few moments after I'm gone.
I'll meet you there.

592
00:52:47,347 --> 00:52:49,474
- Dolici.
- Darling.

593
00:52:51,785 --> 00:52:55,050
We have only a few moments together,
and I'm crying.

594
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,223
You haven't changed a bit.

595
00:52:57,624 --> 00:53:00,491
You're just as I remembered you
a thousand times.

596
00:53:00,927 --> 00:53:03,521
I can't tell you how much
I wanted this moment.

597
00:53:03,630 --> 00:53:05,097
How I wanted to hold you...

598
00:53:09,302 --> 00:53:11,167
Is there someplace we can be alone?

599
00:53:11,304 --> 00:53:14,330
Where? They cast a long shadow.

600
00:53:15,408 --> 00:53:18,741
I don't care.
I can't leave you now that I've found you.

601
00:53:19,145 --> 00:53:21,113
What good can we do now?

602
00:53:21,615 --> 00:53:24,175
Maybe the Americans
will come back someday.

603
00:53:24,317 --> 00:53:25,944
I'll come back with them then.

604
00:53:26,086 --> 00:53:29,021
No. We're not waiting
for anyone to come back.

605
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,223
We don't want freedom as a gift.

606
00:53:31,324 --> 00:53:35,124
We want it as a right to something
we've fought and died for.

607
00:53:37,230 --> 00:53:40,222
- I'll kill him if he comes back.
- I've got to go now.

608
00:53:40,333 --> 00:53:43,734
You're throwing away our happiness.
Come away with me.

609
00:53:44,037 --> 00:53:46,597
- Are you with Madden?
- Yes, we're on Balintawak.

610
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:49,038
When can I see you again?
When can I come back?

611
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:52,908
Don't come back here ever.
Maybe I'll be able to come to you.

612
00:53:53,446 --> 00:53:55,243
We must fight, Andrés.

613
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:09,926
- So you came back?
- Yeah. I saw Dolici.

614
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:12,191
- Good.
- You've known about her for some time?

615
00:54:12,299 --> 00:54:13,459
- Yes.
- Why didn't you tell me?

616
00:54:13,566 --> 00:54:16,763
Didn't you think I'd like to know
the woman I love was not a traitor?

617
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:18,235
- I was under orders.
- Orders?

618
00:54:18,371 --> 00:54:21,738
Yes, orders that might affect
every American and Filipino on the island.

619
00:54:21,875 --> 00:54:23,399
Don't talk to me about the Filipinos.

620
00:54:23,510 --> 00:54:26,172
Mention freedom around them
and they don't stop to think.

621
00:54:26,279 --> 00:54:28,645
They walk empty-handed
into blazing machine-gun fire.

622
00:54:28,782 --> 00:54:30,306
But you and I should know better.

623
00:54:30,417 --> 00:54:33,215
We should stop to think
if we've got a million-to-one chance.

624
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,016
But no. You and Dolici
have gone out of your heads.

625
00:54:36,156 --> 00:54:40,058
Okay, we're crazy.
We and 17 million Filipinos.

626
00:54:40,660 --> 00:54:43,629
- What'd you come back here for?
- Because I'm crazy, too.

627
00:54:43,730 --> 00:54:47,894
I wanna keep on fighting Japs,
even though I know it's completely mad.

628
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:50,195
Don't get me wrong.
No one's gonna use my name...

629
00:54:50,303 --> 00:54:53,739
to encourage people to kill themselves
faster than the Japs are doing it.

630
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:57,298
I'll stick around and fight,
only until Dolici decides to joins me.

631
00:54:57,410 --> 00:55:00,345
After that, we're getting out of here
as fast as we can.

632
00:55:00,413 --> 00:55:03,439
All right, if that's the way
you feel about it.

633
00:55:03,550 --> 00:55:06,144
We'll do the best we can without you.

634
00:55:06,619 --> 00:55:10,453
But just between us lunatics,
I think we'll win.

635
00:58:03,696 --> 00:58:05,527
But what is being done?

636
00:58:05,632 --> 00:58:08,226
Your Excellency,
we cannot find the enemy.

637
00:58:08,368 --> 00:58:11,064
We send 100 men out,
and they see nothing.

638
00:58:11,204 --> 00:58:13,866
We send 10 men,
and they don't come back.

639
00:58:14,007 --> 00:58:16,771
We have set up severe reprisals,
Your Excellency.

640
00:58:17,377 --> 00:58:19,641
Reprisals.

641
00:58:20,813 --> 00:58:22,974
Your Excellency, you must let me resign.

642
00:58:23,383 --> 00:58:26,648
A dead man cannot serve the Japanese,
no matter how hard he tried.

643
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:29,984
Look, they came into my bedroom
while I was asleep.

644
00:58:30,390 --> 00:58:34,827
They painted this on my pillow.
Right next to my throat.

645
00:58:36,062 --> 00:58:39,031
This is a sign of war.
This is my death warrant.

646
00:58:39,165 --> 00:58:41,531
You're in no danger.
We'll provide sentries.

647
00:58:41,634 --> 00:58:44,467
I'm the Chief of Police.
I had four sentries there all night.

648
00:58:44,571 --> 00:58:47,301
- You're under our protection.
- Protection?

649
00:58:48,908 --> 00:58:53,607
Did you protect the Mayor of Legaspi,
or the Commissioner of Malolos, or...

650
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:57,272
Six whole divisions at your disposal...

651
00:58:57,650 --> 00:59:00,414
and you couldn't even protect our friends.

652
00:59:01,221 --> 00:59:04,213
All you could think about was reprisals.

653
00:59:05,625 --> 00:59:07,388
Send in Miss Dalgado.

654
00:59:08,361 --> 00:59:11,023
You have my personal guarantee of safety.
You may go.

655
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:13,462
Yes, thank you, Your Excellency.

656
00:59:14,534 --> 00:59:17,765
They might have just as easily
slit my throat.

657
00:59:19,872 --> 00:59:22,272
Miss Dalgado, tell Col. Coroki...

658
00:59:22,375 --> 00:59:25,606
why we have failed to win
the Filipino people over.

659
00:59:26,212 --> 00:59:27,474
I was not aware that...

660
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:31,949
The guerrillas obviously have the complete
aid and sympathy of the people.

661
00:59:32,051 --> 00:59:34,815
We are interested only in a frank answer.

662
00:59:35,888 --> 00:59:39,289
There's no advantage
in cooperating with the Japanese.

663
00:59:39,659 --> 00:59:44,028
A man obeys all the Japanese laws.
When he's taken at random and shot...

664
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:48,093
his next-door neighbor will think,
"It does a man no good to obey."

665
00:59:48,201 --> 00:59:49,862
He might as well die fighting.

666
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:53,666
You're a conquered people.
What do you expect, independence?

667
00:59:53,773 --> 00:59:55,968
That's not a bad idea, Coroki.

668
00:59:56,676 --> 01:00:00,134
Miss Dalgado,
Tokyo has graciously consented...

669
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:03,772
to grant full independence
to its little nephews and nieces.

670
01:00:03,916 --> 01:00:07,613
Now your people will see
the advantage of cooperating with us.

671
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:11,781
Why, we will be able to hold these islands
with only two divisions.

672
01:00:12,325 --> 01:00:16,352
The granting of independence
must be an impressive occasion.

673
01:00:16,963 --> 01:00:21,525
- You will help us, Miss Dalgado?
- It will be a great honor, Your Excellency.

674
01:00:22,669 --> 01:00:26,867
Perhaps it would be a good idea
to hold the ceremonies at Balintawak.

675
01:00:27,073 --> 01:00:30,133
It's the birthplace
of Philippine independence.

676
01:00:30,243 --> 01:00:32,211
An intelligent suggestion.

677
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:37,672
The arrangements will be left
in Col. Coroki's hands.

678
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,718
To avoid any possible interference
with the ceremony...

679
01:00:41,821 --> 01:00:44,312
I suggest you keep the place secret.

680
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:47,891
We wish to make that
a memorable occasion, Colonel.

681
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:51,224
It will be a most memorable occasion,
Your Excellency.

682
01:00:51,331 --> 01:00:53,993
Yes. Make it memorable, Colonel.

683
01:00:54,567 --> 01:00:56,034
Most memorable.

684
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:09,839
You can find room for this.

685
01:01:12,118 --> 01:01:15,246
- Captain, everything's okay in Balintawak.
- What did you tell them?

686
01:01:15,355 --> 01:01:17,983
- What you told me to say.
- Tell me exactly what you said.

687
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:21,288
I told them nobody was to do anything
that might tip the Japs off.

688
01:01:21,394 --> 01:01:24,852
Everybody's supposed to do
their business, do what the Japs said...

689
01:01:24,997 --> 01:01:27,465
and when the shooting started,
everybody should scram.

690
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,296
You told them the Japs
have promised us full independence?

691
01:01:30,403 --> 01:01:32,371
- What did they say?
- Nothing.

692
01:01:32,505 --> 01:01:35,201
Bernessa, get the drums going.
Get all the men together.

693
01:01:35,308 --> 01:01:37,037
- Pvt. Cuenca?
- Yes, sir?

694
01:01:37,143 --> 01:01:40,909
You accomplished your mission. I think
he deserves a red star, Miss Barnes.

695
01:01:41,013 --> 01:01:42,241
Red star, indeed.

696
01:01:42,348 --> 01:01:46,114
In his last composition, he spelled
"liberty" with a "U" instead of an "E."

697
01:01:52,024 --> 01:01:56,791
Say, Colonel, it will only take one informer
to tip this whole deal off to the Japs.

698
01:01:56,896 --> 01:01:58,329
That's right.

699
01:01:59,465 --> 01:02:03,231
- What of it?
- Nothing. Just thinking out loud, I guess.

700
01:02:05,505 --> 01:02:08,804
I don't know what I'm standing around for
with so much to be done.

701
01:02:08,908 --> 01:02:12,071
Maximo, I've outlined
a course of study for the children.

702
01:02:12,178 --> 01:02:14,703
You tell them they must
keep up on their studies now.

703
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:16,679
They must brush their teeth twice a day.

704
01:02:16,783 --> 01:02:19,377
Tell them to eat lots of greens
if they can get them.

705
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:21,350
I'm leaving with Col. Madden.

706
01:02:21,454 --> 01:02:24,651
- But I'm going along.
- That's out of the question.

707
01:02:24,791 --> 01:02:27,021
Besides, you must take charge
of the children.

708
01:02:27,126 --> 01:02:29,959
But he promised me.
He said I could be a scout.

709
01:02:30,062 --> 01:02:32,053
Yes, I did, and I have been
meaning to speak...

710
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:35,794
You've done altogether too much
playing at war for your age. I think...

711
01:02:35,902 --> 01:02:38,097
- I'm going to be a scout.
- Maximo, you mustn't...

712
01:02:38,204 --> 01:02:41,173
If you don't mind, Colonel,
Maximo is still my pupil.

713
01:02:43,409 --> 01:02:45,775
Now, you get that nonsense
out of your head.

714
01:02:45,878 --> 01:02:48,642
- I'll get the outline.
- I'm not going back.

715
01:02:48,748 --> 01:02:51,649
Maximo, if you insist
on this stubbornness...

716
01:02:52,418 --> 01:02:56,047
I'm afraid I'm going to have to leave
without saying goodbye.

717
01:02:56,155 --> 01:02:57,850
I'm going with you.

718
01:03:02,829 --> 01:03:04,956
Maximo, come here.

719
01:03:07,633 --> 01:03:08,861
Sit down.

720
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:13,300
Miss Barnes loves you very much.

721
01:03:13,406 --> 01:03:16,102
I know. I'm sorry, but I want to go.

722
01:03:16,209 --> 01:03:19,940
You can't. After tomorrow,
the Japs will be chasing us night and day.

723
01:03:20,046 --> 01:03:21,775
We're going to have to move fast.

724
01:03:21,881 --> 01:03:24,679
We'll be sleeping in swamps.
There'll be days without food.

725
01:03:24,784 --> 01:03:26,012
Sounds okay to me.

726
01:03:26,118 --> 01:03:28,552
But you're much too important
for us to risk.

727
01:03:28,654 --> 01:03:30,986
You're the guy we're fighting this war for.

728
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:32,523
I'd rather be a Scout.

729
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:35,526
This thing isn't going to last forever.
And after it's over...

730
01:03:35,628 --> 01:03:38,392
you're going to have to be the one
to build and plan.

731
01:03:38,498 --> 01:03:41,058
You'll help make the Philippines
a great nation.

732
01:03:41,167 --> 01:03:45,194
You did promise me.
You even called me "Pvt. Cuenca."

733
01:03:47,473 --> 01:03:48,804
All right.

734
01:03:50,076 --> 01:03:52,135
I'll tell you what I'll do.

735
01:03:53,112 --> 01:03:55,307
I'll make you a full colonel.

736
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:04,483
The first thing an officer has to learn is
to take orders and obey them to the letter.

737
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:06,455
Remember what Miss Barnes said.

738
01:04:06,559 --> 01:04:10,051
Take charge of those kids and make sure
they keep up on their studies.

739
01:04:10,162 --> 01:04:12,221
Stay out of trouble. Got it?

740
01:04:13,299 --> 01:04:15,927
- Yes, sir.
- Okay, Colonel.

741
01:04:17,169 --> 01:04:19,364
- I'll be seeing you.
- Yes, sir.

742
01:04:21,173 --> 01:04:23,869
<i>In a few moments, we will be on the air.</i>

743
01:04:24,310 --> 01:04:28,246
<i>In the meantime, here are the instructions</i>
<i>for those gathered in this park.</i>

744
01:04:28,347 --> 01:04:32,044
<i>You are enjoined to obey strictly</i>
<i>the following regulations.</i>

745
01:04:32,618 --> 01:04:36,486
<i>One: Do not show any flag</i>
<i>but the Japanese flag.</i>

746
01:04:36,956 --> 01:04:40,790
<i>Two: At the appropriate times</i>
<i>you will shout "banzai"...</i>

747
01:04:41,227 --> 01:04:44,958
<i>Ioudly, and with enthusiasm, three times.</i>

748
01:04:45,698 --> 01:04:49,259
<i>Three: Do not make</i>
<i>any suspicious movement.</i>

749
01:04:49,368 --> 01:04:50,926
<i>We are about to broadcast.</i>

750
01:04:51,037 --> 01:04:54,598
<i>There will be a complete silence</i>
<i>unless otherwise indicated.</i>

751
01:04:57,510 --> 01:04:59,102
<i>People of the Philippines...</i>

752
01:04:59,211 --> 01:05:03,147
<i>we are broadcasting from Balintawak,</i>
<i>the birthplace of Filipino freedom.</i>

753
01:05:03,249 --> 01:05:07,413
<i>Seventeen million Filipinos are gathered</i>
<i>around their radios all over the islands...</i>

754
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:10,080
<i>at the invitation of</i>
<i>the Japanese government.</i>

755
01:05:10,189 --> 01:05:14,489
<i>Today the seeds of Filipino</i>
<i>and Japanese friendship flower and bloom.</i>

756
01:05:14,594 --> 01:05:18,394
<i>This day will live forever</i>
<i>in the memory of every true Filipino.</i>

757
01:05:18,497 --> 01:05:20,897
<i>People of the Philippines,</i>
<i>we now bring to you...</i>

758
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,400
<i>His lmperial Highness, Prince lto.</i>

759
01:05:25,371 --> 01:05:28,772
Banzai!

760
01:05:33,012 --> 01:05:35,640
<i>The Filipino nation will be included...</i>

761
01:05:35,748 --> 01:05:39,240
<i>in the Greater East Asia,</i>
<i>Co-Prosperity Sphere.</i>

762
01:05:39,685 --> 01:05:42,176
<i>Therefore, by virtue of the authority...</i>

763
01:05:42,288 --> 01:05:45,815
<i>of His lmperial Majesty,</i>
<i>the Emperor of Japan...</i>

764
01:05:53,132 --> 01:05:55,327
<i>I hereby proclaim to the world...</i>

765
01:05:55,434 --> 01:05:59,632
<i>the full and complete independence</i>
<i>of the Republic of the Philippines.</i>

766
01:05:59,739 --> 01:06:03,197
Banzai!

767
01:06:03,309 --> 01:06:05,971
<i>There is lavish cheering</i>
<i>from the people of Balintawak.</i>

768
01:06:06,078 --> 01:06:08,376
<i>His lmperial Highness,</i>
<i>Prince lto, has retired.</i>

769
01:06:08,481 --> 01:06:10,506
<i>Miss Dolici Dalgado's</i>
<i>crossing the platform...</i>

770
01:06:10,616 --> 01:06:13,608
<i>and will now raise the first flag</i>
<i>of the new Philippine Republic.</i>

771
01:06:13,719 --> 01:06:17,746
<i>The guard of honor will fire a volley</i>
<i>to commemorate this historic event.</i>

772
01:06:28,034 --> 01:06:29,365
Take cover!

773
01:06:29,769 --> 01:06:31,066
Follow me!

774
01:06:49,055 --> 01:06:51,023
<i>This is Dolici Dalgado speaking to you.</i>

775
01:06:51,123 --> 01:06:53,182
<i>For the first time</i>
<i>I'm able to speak the truth.</i>

776
01:06:53,292 --> 01:06:56,159
<i>The Japanese have offered us</i>
<i>what they call independence.</i>

777
01:06:56,262 --> 01:06:57,627
<i>Let this be our answer.</i>

778
01:07:01,667 --> 01:07:04,067
Take cover!

779
01:07:08,340 --> 01:07:10,672
Fire at the radio. Destroy it!

780
01:07:16,248 --> 01:07:17,806
Cover Bonifacio.

781
01:07:25,858 --> 01:07:28,190
<i>Resist the Jap invader. Head for the hills.</i>

782
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:29,886
Let's get out of here.

783
01:08:07,933 --> 01:08:10,561
Cease firing!

784
01:08:11,303 --> 01:08:14,636
Lieutenant, assemble the men,
round up the civilians.

785
01:08:14,974 --> 01:08:17,374
This is what we get
for granting them independence.

786
01:08:17,476 --> 01:08:21,242
I told Homma this gesture was foolish.
This is no way to handle Filipinos.

787
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:23,247
I knew the girl wasn't to be trusted.

788
01:08:23,349 --> 01:08:26,716
From now on, we'll smash them
before they resist. Get out after them.

789
01:08:26,819 --> 01:08:28,286
Where do you suggest I look?

790
01:08:28,387 --> 01:08:31,015
Anywhere. But find them,
especially the girl.

791
01:08:31,123 --> 01:08:34,786
I want them hounded until
every one of them is brought back to me.

792
01:08:40,032 --> 01:08:41,329
Let me go.

793
01:08:46,071 --> 01:08:49,802
Your Excellency, I saw this boy
direct a crowd off the field.

794
01:08:49,909 --> 01:08:52,707
I caught him as he was trying to run away.

795
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,625
Where did you get this?

796
01:09:18,804 --> 01:09:22,262
Where are their headquarters? Talk!

797
01:09:30,216 --> 01:09:31,843
Where did they go?

798
01:09:32,852 --> 01:09:33,978
Don't.

799
01:09:34,854 --> 01:09:36,321
I'll show you.

800
01:09:37,022 --> 01:09:39,820
- I'll show you where they went.
- All right.

801
01:10:02,581 --> 01:10:04,515
- You know what I've been thinking?
- What?

802
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:07,085
Wouldn't it be nice
if we were on that road above...

803
01:10:07,152 --> 01:10:09,143
and had a bunch of Japs
caught down here?

804
01:10:09,255 --> 01:10:10,222
It sure would.

805
01:10:10,322 --> 01:10:12,790
We could pick them off like ducks
in a shooting gallery.

806
01:10:12,892 --> 01:10:14,382
We'd murder them.

807
01:10:29,275 --> 01:10:30,640
Hold it up.

808
01:10:31,310 --> 01:10:33,278
Here. Catch your breath.

809
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:49,950
We could come down that road
and catch the Japs like rats in a trap.

810
01:10:50,062 --> 01:10:52,189
They wouldn't have a chance.

811
01:10:57,269 --> 01:10:58,702
I'm all right.

812
01:11:03,542 --> 01:11:05,066
Come on, honey.

813
01:11:29,301 --> 01:11:32,293
There they are.
Stop at the head of the canyon.

814
01:11:32,404 --> 01:11:35,271
- I know what you're thinking.
- You do? How come?

815
01:11:35,374 --> 01:11:36,773
I'm psychic.

816
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:39,075
What's that?

817
01:11:44,183 --> 01:11:45,548
Take cover!

818
01:11:58,430 --> 01:12:00,421
Boy, could we murder them.

819
01:12:11,944 --> 01:12:13,468
Stop it!

820
01:12:56,388 --> 01:12:57,582
Maximo.

821
01:13:00,659 --> 01:13:02,092
I won't tell.

822
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:05,491
- I won't tell.
- It's Miss Barnes, Maximo.

823
01:13:10,903 --> 01:13:14,339
- They didn't get you, did they?
- No, dear, they didn't.

824
01:13:19,078 --> 01:13:20,978
They took my eagle away.

825
01:13:30,923 --> 01:13:33,118
- Miss Barnes.
- Yes, dear?

826
01:13:34,359 --> 01:13:36,623
I'm sorry I didn't say goodbye.

827
01:13:38,931 --> 01:13:41,900
I'm sorry I didn't learn to spell "liberty."

828
01:13:47,039 --> 01:13:48,199
Dear God.

829
01:13:48,841 --> 01:13:51,537
Who ever learned it so well.

830
01:14:54,206 --> 01:14:57,664
Col. Madden,
Australia has been trying to get you, sir.

831
01:14:57,809 --> 01:15:00,573
- Where have you got your radio set up?
- This way, sir.

832
01:15:19,331 --> 01:15:21,094
About two weeks, sir.

833
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:23,129
I think a razor, sir.

834
01:15:23,936 --> 01:15:25,267
Thank you.

835
01:15:32,578 --> 01:15:34,307
Bernessa, we're going on ahead.

836
01:15:34,446 --> 01:15:37,347
We're going to have to leave you.
I got word from headquarters.

837
01:15:37,449 --> 01:15:40,316
- We're going with you, aren't we?
- No. We have to move fast.

838
01:15:40,452 --> 01:15:44,354
You'd better break up into small groups
and head for this spot in northern Leyte.

839
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:46,617
American submarines
have been putting in there.

840
01:15:46,725 --> 01:15:50,320
- What's up, Joe?
- I don't know yet. Maybe something big.

841
01:15:52,064 --> 01:15:53,895
- Well, good luck.
- Goodbye, Colonel.

842
01:15:54,066 --> 01:15:55,055
So long, Colonel.

843
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:57,225
- Joe.
- Yes?

844
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:00,135
Good luck.

845
01:16:00,272 --> 01:16:01,796
Thanks, Andrés.

846
01:16:02,341 --> 01:16:04,036
I'll be seeing you.

847
01:17:03,302 --> 01:17:05,327
- Bernessa.
- Santo.

848
01:17:06,405 --> 01:17:09,135
- Pepe. Captain.
- Bernessa, how are you?

849
01:17:09,241 --> 01:17:11,801
- We had word you were coming.
- Where is Col. Madden?

850
01:17:11,943 --> 01:17:14,434
Headquarters sent for him.
They took him to Australia.

851
01:17:14,579 --> 01:17:16,103
But I think he'll be back soon.

852
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:19,377
There's a camp up ahead.
It's not very far. Come on, let's go.

853
01:17:19,484 --> 01:17:21,076
Thank you, Bernessa.

854
01:17:31,029 --> 01:17:33,657
Glad to see you. I'm Capt. Bonifacio.

855
01:17:33,799 --> 01:17:36,495
Welcome, Captain. We're glad to see you.

856
01:17:39,671 --> 01:17:43,004
- What are these people doing here?
- They're waiting for the submarine.

857
01:17:43,108 --> 01:17:46,737
There are thousands more
with their families all over this area.

858
01:17:48,213 --> 01:17:50,613
These people look like they're starving.

859
01:17:50,716 --> 01:17:53,241
Why don't you break up
and spread over the countryside?

860
01:17:53,385 --> 01:17:56,843
We must stay together. Rumor is,
this is where the action will take place.

861
01:17:56,988 --> 01:17:58,956
You'd risk all these lives on a rumor?

862
01:17:59,057 --> 01:18:01,116
The rumors we hear are true.

863
01:18:01,226 --> 01:18:03,387
How long have you been
waiting for this submarine?

864
01:18:03,528 --> 01:18:05,359
- Two weeks.
- Two weeks?

865
01:18:05,697 --> 01:18:09,565
How much food do you think
a submarine can bring, if it comes?

866
01:18:09,668 --> 01:18:12,068
Not much food maybe, but many guns.

867
01:18:13,171 --> 01:18:14,866
- Have you had any word?
- Not yet.

868
01:18:14,973 --> 01:18:16,804
We've been sending
two men out in a boat.

869
01:18:16,908 --> 01:18:20,867
They fly an American flag and wait.
Maybe a submarine will see them.

870
01:18:20,979 --> 01:18:23,004
What if a Jap plane sees them?

871
01:18:23,148 --> 01:18:25,173
Then we send two other men.

872
01:18:25,951 --> 01:18:28,749
Why are you puzzled?
Aren't you a Filipino?

873
01:18:45,837 --> 01:18:48,567
Whose idea was it
to volunteer for this job?

874
01:18:48,673 --> 01:18:49,833
Yours.

875
01:18:50,942 --> 01:18:53,843
I must have been delirious for lack of food.

876
01:18:56,348 --> 01:18:58,816
Maybe I'll dream me up a nice steak.

877
01:18:59,384 --> 01:19:01,011
Dream me one, too.

878
01:19:01,219 --> 01:19:04,086
- How would you like it?
- Medium rare.

879
01:19:04,756 --> 01:19:06,018
Coming up.

880
01:19:16,301 --> 01:19:17,598
Submarine!

881
01:20:34,412 --> 01:20:35,879
Andrés.

882
01:20:36,448 --> 01:20:38,075
Capt. Bonifacio.

883
01:20:38,383 --> 01:20:41,819
- Hello, Andrés.
- Hiya, Joe. You look naked.

884
01:20:42,621 --> 01:20:44,111
You're all set.

885
01:20:45,023 --> 01:20:46,615
You're going out.

886
01:20:46,858 --> 01:20:48,621
I'm not leaving, Joe.

887
01:20:50,028 --> 01:20:51,427
I belong here.

888
01:20:57,869 --> 01:21:01,066
This is Comdr. Waite
of the United States Navy.

889
01:21:01,873 --> 01:21:03,431
He has good news for you.

890
01:21:03,542 --> 01:21:05,840
I heard so much about
what you're doing here...

891
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:09,038
I finally persuaded headquarters
to let me take on this mission...

892
01:21:09,180 --> 01:21:11,080
so I could see for myself.

893
01:21:11,182 --> 01:21:14,083
I really don't deserve to be the one
to bring you this news...

894
01:21:14,185 --> 01:21:15,482
but I'm proud that I am.

895
01:21:15,587 --> 01:21:19,614
Two and a half years ago, we promised
the Filipino people we'd come back.

896
01:21:19,724 --> 01:21:21,157
We're coming.

897
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:24,354
On October 20, at 10:00 in the morning...

898
01:21:24,462 --> 01:21:27,920
the soldiers of the American Army
will land in force, right here on Leyte.

899
01:21:28,033 --> 01:21:29,796
The Navy will prepare the way.

900
01:21:29,901 --> 01:21:31,664
Two hours before the actual landings...

901
01:21:31,770 --> 01:21:34,568
there'll be heavy navy bombardment
on all the landing areas.

902
01:21:34,673 --> 01:21:38,131
Part of my job is to get word
to all Filipino civilians in those areas...

903
01:21:38,243 --> 01:21:40,609
to evacuate nine days before D-day.

904
01:21:40,712 --> 01:21:43,840
That'll give the Japs a good idea
where to expect the landings.

905
01:21:43,949 --> 01:21:46,713
There's nothing else we can do.
We can't risk civilian lives.

906
01:21:46,818 --> 01:21:49,844
There haven't been any civilians here
since the fall of Bataan.

907
01:21:49,955 --> 01:21:53,391
If it'll save American lives
and help make the landing safe...

908
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:56,392
- our people will not evacuate.
- That's right.

909
01:21:57,462 --> 01:21:59,555
I'm sure glad you guys are on our side.

910
01:21:59,664 --> 01:22:02,428
That won't be necessary.
Headquarters has sent me here...

911
01:22:02,534 --> 01:22:06,095
to help you do a job
that's more important, if we can do it.

912
01:22:06,204 --> 01:22:08,172
The moment naval bombardment begins...

913
01:22:08,273 --> 01:22:11,208
the Japs will know
the exact locations of our landings.

914
01:22:11,343 --> 01:22:14,904
They'll immediately try
to rush reinforcements to those spots.

915
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:18,176
The only road capable
of handling heavy transport...

916
01:22:18,283 --> 01:22:20,376
runs through the village of Bolog.

917
01:22:20,485 --> 01:22:23,215
If we can block that road and hold it...

918
01:22:23,321 --> 01:22:26,779
- the Japs can't get through in time.
- How long do we hold them?

919
01:22:26,891 --> 01:22:30,554
From 8:00 in the morning,
when the bombardment begins until 11:00.

920
01:22:30,662 --> 01:22:33,290
By that time,
MacArthur's beachhead should be secure.

921
01:22:33,398 --> 01:22:34,456
Okay.

922
01:22:34,566 --> 01:22:38,662
But the army doesn't expect to have
forces at Bolog until 2:30...

923
01:22:39,437 --> 01:22:43,237
which means six hours and a half
before we can figure on any help.

924
01:22:43,341 --> 01:22:44,399
Okay.

925
01:22:46,845 --> 01:22:48,836
- Is that all, sir?
- I think so.

926
01:22:48,947 --> 01:22:50,676
You don't seem to have much equipment.

927
01:22:50,782 --> 01:22:53,410
We'll get more at Bolog.
There's a Jap supply depot there.

928
01:22:53,518 --> 01:22:56,282
That's open country,
nothing but rice paddies all around.

929
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:57,616
We know.

930
01:22:57,756 --> 01:23:01,055
What this amounts to
is a surprise attack in broad daylight...

931
01:23:01,159 --> 01:23:04,094
in open country where the Japs
would probably expect something.

932
01:23:04,195 --> 01:23:06,390
That's right, sir. It won't be easy.

933
01:23:06,498 --> 01:23:10,730
I think you can report to headquarters
that the mission will be accomplished.

934
01:23:10,835 --> 01:23:12,097
Yes, sir.

935
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:16,097
- Do you have any idea how it'll be done?
- Sure.

936
01:23:16,207 --> 01:23:19,199
Just so I can tell my grandchildren,
how do you plan to do it?

937
01:23:19,310 --> 01:23:21,608
Trickery, Commander, sheer trickery.

938
01:23:21,713 --> 01:23:26,116
As a matter of fact, an old Filipino trick
that I learned the hard way...

939
01:23:26,217 --> 01:23:28,310
from Capt. Bonifacio's grandfather.

940
01:24:03,621 --> 01:24:05,612
- Any sign of anything?
- No, Your Excellency.

941
01:24:05,724 --> 01:24:07,624
Have you checked
the undergrowth over there?

942
01:24:07,726 --> 01:24:09,819
Yes, Your Excellency. Nothing suspicious.

943
01:24:09,928 --> 01:24:12,692
It's very strange.
Civilians are evacuating this area.

944
01:24:12,797 --> 01:24:15,061
- Double the sentries.
- Yes, Your Excellency.

945
01:25:43,588 --> 01:25:45,317
Get down, you idiot!

946
01:26:28,299 --> 01:26:31,666
One more to go. I'll take the first one.

947
01:26:53,191 --> 01:26:56,217
- You got a grenade, Bernessa?
- I'm all out, sir.

948
01:26:56,995 --> 01:26:58,360
Hey, Bindle!

949
01:26:59,030 --> 01:27:01,191
- Yeah?
- How's your pitching arm?

950
01:27:50,715 --> 01:27:52,774
Come on. Let's get to work.

951
01:28:14,072 --> 01:28:15,835
Japanese land mines, sir.

952
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:18,135
- Andrés, some land mines.
- Good.

953
01:28:18,242 --> 01:28:21,473
Plant them far enough forward
so they won't mess up our tank traps.

954
01:28:21,579 --> 01:28:24,070
Put Santos in charge of TNT for the bridge.

955
01:28:24,182 --> 01:28:25,308
Santos, come on.

956
01:28:25,416 --> 01:28:27,008
- Bernessa.
- Yes, sir?

957
01:28:27,118 --> 01:28:29,814
Get about 20 men.
We'll pick out some defense positions.

958
01:28:29,921 --> 01:28:31,149
Yes, sir.

959
01:28:31,255 --> 01:28:32,882
What do you got here?

960
01:28:32,991 --> 01:28:35,789
Nothing big enough
to stop a tank, Colonel.

961
01:29:05,256 --> 01:29:06,723
Miss Barnes...

962
01:29:06,824 --> 01:29:10,851
they're bringing back the books they hid
while the Japs were here.

963
01:29:13,664 --> 01:29:15,825
And our boys are landing now.

964
01:32:15,513 --> 01:32:16,810
This is it.

965
01:32:27,558 --> 01:32:29,287
Fire at the parapet.

966
01:32:57,288 --> 01:32:59,756
Capt. Jackson reporting, sir.
Ready to take over.

967
01:32:59,857 --> 01:33:02,018
- They're all yours.
- Yes, sir.

968
01:33:06,163 --> 01:33:08,131
You're three minutes late!

969
01:33:19,677 --> 01:33:21,611
I brought you something.

970
01:33:22,513 --> 01:33:24,208
Free Filipino soil.

971
01:33:24,782 --> 01:33:27,683
You better get this arm bandaged.
There's still lots to do.

972
01:33:27,785 --> 01:33:30,652
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

973
01:33:33,124 --> 01:33:36,491
<i>The blood, sweat, and tears</i>
<i>have not been in vain.</i>

974
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:39,189
<i>Freedom is on the march again.</i>

975
01:34:31,816 --> 01:34:32,646
English
