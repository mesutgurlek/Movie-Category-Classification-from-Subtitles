00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:06,518
- <i>Thunder</i>?
- Yes.

159
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,429
Cmdr. Steele,
I'd like to be excused.

160
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,956
- My ex-husband's on that boat.
- I thought you wanted to meet him.

161
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,236
I do.

162
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,834
But on the <i>Thunder,</i>
I'll be the visiting team.

163
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,151
I'd like the first meeting
to be on my home ground.

164
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:25,552
As your senior officer, I should comply
with this request and order you to go.

165
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:28,598
But as one woman to another,
how's your headache?

166
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,960
- Splitting.
- You're excused.

167
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,394
Thank you.

ADMIRAL: Welcome. How are you?
DUKE: Good to see you, sir.

172
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:11,037
- Hello, captain.
- Somebody enjoyed himself in Australia.

173
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,952
Yes. Nice people down there, sir.

174

We're happy to be home too, sir.

ADMIRAL: Chief?
- Good afternoon, sir.

Shall we go below, gentlemen?

181
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:41,557
Sorry about your carrier, Pop.
We contacted the <i>Sarasota</i>...

182
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:45,633
...and her planes got the cruiser and
two destroyers. The carrier got away.

183
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,233
Better luck next patrol.

184
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,958
We'd have wrapped her up...

185
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:52,317
...except for those two prematures
that rattled our eyeteeth.

186
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,357
What will we do about the torpedoes?

187
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:56,317
DUKE:
Knocked the bottom out of my gang.

188
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,239
Those magnetic exploders
are driving us all crazy.

189
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,153
Everybody from the Bureau of Ordinance
on down is working on it.

190

We're doing something.
We're dropping them next patrol.

DUKE:
Good.

192
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:12,434
- We're going back to contact exploders.
- Maybe we can get a few hits now.

193
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,160
- Here's our patrol report, sir.
LARRY: Captain, captain.

Duke, you brought them aboard.
You take the bow.

Sister Anna, we've been looking
for you.

- Huh? Oh, nothing.

Yeah, just a minute. I'll be right back.

Oh, I'm sorry, nurse.

Stop that. Do you wanna
have them all crying?

00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,439
- No...
- Where's your mask?

00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,953
- Mask?
- Over your nose.

223
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,839
- You're breathing germs in on them.
- Where's yours?

- Are you the baby's father?

You shouldn't be here. Leave.

I carried him through the jungle,
helped deliver him.

All right, now he's delivered.

228
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,314
As for the rest of it, may I remind you
that this is not the jungle? Good day.

Well, how do you like that?

I suppose you don't like Butch

00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,151
I suppose I love it.

234
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,914
I knew a Butch.

It's still there, huh?

- That old zing.

237
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,392
Of course it's still there, you big ape.
What do you think could happen to it?

238
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:51,393
Those things you said at the trial.

239
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,633
Do you think anybody ever tells the
real reason for a divorce at the trial?

240
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,950
What was the real reason?

241
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,951
Just now, when I kissed you...

00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,756
...well, that's where we were
four years ago.

Hey, I'm proud of you.
Where did you train?

What did the gentleman
from North Carolina say?

00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,551
Dad was all for it.

247
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:18,996
I told him it was sort of a penance.

248
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:23,110
You felt like you should do penance?

249
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:26,636
Well, I felt like one of us should.

250
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,875
Penance.

251
00:25:30,040 --> 00:25:35,114
I've been numb for four years,
trying to figure what happened to us.

252
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:40,720
We had something,
but I guess I kicked it around.

253
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,949
Why don't we pick up the pieces
and start over?

254
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,350
- What time do you get out of here?
- 6:30.

255
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,071
At 6:30, get your hat, coat, stick and
gloves, and we'll go out on the town.

- Wine, of course.

257
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,757
Remember that little hotel?

258
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:58,878
- The waiter asked about you...
- The waiter asked about you... You too?

259
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,598
Uh-huh.

260
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,753
After dinner, we'll dance a while,
then sneak away...

261
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,672
Duke, I've got a date.

262
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,717
- Break it.
- I can't.

263
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:10,713
It's with Bob Perry.
You would remember him.

264
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:14,754
Bob Perry? Little Bobby Perry?
Pop's kid brother?

265
00:26:14,920 --> 00:26:19,038
- What makes you think he's such a kid?
- I used to pat him on the head.

266
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:21,156
- You seen him recently?
- No.

267
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:24,676
Next time you pat him on the head,
let me know. I wanna be there.

268
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:28,037

This is my headache.

272
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,672
Oh.

273
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:53,920
Honey, I could never marry a submariner.
I like to sleep with the windows open.

274
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,596
- Mr. Caldwell is doing all right.
- He sure is.

00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,756
Mmm. Tasty. Special?

276

I promised somebody
I'd buy wine tonight.

277

Here we go.

278
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:17,710
Say, what ever happened
to that kid brother of yours?

279
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,758
Bob? You'd never know him, Duke.

280
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,310
What a great, big, good-Iooking guy
he turned out to be.

281
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,830
And what he does to those gals.

282
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,958
He sure got all the glamour
in our family.

283

- Good evening.
- For two, please.

00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,593
Right this way, please.

285
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:40,754
Look, Bob. It's Pop and Duke.

286
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:44,635
POP: Mary Stuart.
- Pop.

287
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,917
Bob. Duke, you remember Bob,
or don't you recognize him?

288
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,832
Oh, yes, fly-fly boy.

289
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,639

If you run into any more good targets,
let us know.

291
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,869
- We'll take care of them.
POP: Don't say anything, Duke.

292
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,389
We can never hope for glory
like they get.

293
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,919
You realize that, huh?

294
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,150
We can do things
you pigboat boys can't.

295
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,719
Yes, sir, you sure can.

296
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:10,431
There's no record of a submarine sinking
one of our own planes by mistake.

297
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,831
- All right, all right.
- Sit. The wine's good. Duke's buying.

298
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,072
We'd like to, but Mary Stuart and I
were about to dance.

299
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:20,431
It's funny, but Mary Stuart and I
were just about to dance.

300
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,194
Well, what do you say, sugar?

301
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,479
Well, it's a very funny thing,
but I was just gonna ask Pop to dance.

302
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,108
Excuse us.

303
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,631
What's the matter, Cupid?

304
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,030
I read your wire.

305
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,398
- Have you been seeing a lot of Bob?
- Uh-huh.

306
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,829
So we level, like always?

307
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,036
- Like always, Pop.
- Good.

308
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,311
I think you and Duke belong together.

309
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:57,550
I don't know what's keeping
you apart...

310
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:02,311
...but I'd hate to think you were using
my kid brother to solve your problem.

311
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,112
Why didn't I meet you first, Pop?

312
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:16,235
Well, tell me about yourself. Pop hasn't
given me a rundown for quite a while.

313
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,153
Oh, I'm a big disappointment
to my brother.

314
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:23,029
When I decided against
that Navy career, I stabbed him.

315
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,954
- Well, what did you wanna be?
- What do you mean, "wanna be"? I am.

316
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,554
An architect. I build things.

317
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:33,235
You can't build much from 10,000 feet
with a load of bombs.

318
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,709
There's a war on.

319
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:39,556
You know, Duke,
I've always envied you.

320
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:42,518
When I was a high-school senior,
an all-city tackle...

321
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:45,592
...you ran 92 yards for a touchdown
to beat Army.

322
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,320
Then when I got to Stanford,
won the UCLA game...

323
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,596
...with a home run
in the ninth inning...

324
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:55,038
...papers were full of what a big man you
were at the raising of that sunken sub.

325
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,154
There were 400 dives on that job.
I made 10 of them.

326
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,154
I know, but you're the guy they talked
about. And then when I joined up...

327
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,233
...got my picture in the hometown paper,
they crowded me off in a corner...

328
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:11,518
...with a story about what a hero
you were at the bombing of Cavite.

329
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,514
And now, here we go again.

330
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,236
Aren't you dramatizing this a little?

331
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,960
No. It's different this time.

332
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:28,475
You're not the hero. You're the sucker.

333
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:32,918
Any man that would let Mary Stuart
get away from him is a sucker.

334
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,629
I see what you mean.

335
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,155
But as the fellow says:

336
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:42,632
"Like the ashes of Alexander,
I was once Alexander."

337
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,950
I'm not sure I get that.

338
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,236
But just to keep the record straight...

339
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,755
...Mary Stuart and I
are gonna be married.

340
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,751
- You told her that?
- Several times.

341
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,638
What did she say?

342
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:57,315
Well, she didn't say no.

343
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,915
Excuse me.

344
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:13,315
- Cutting in, captain.
- Sure, Duke, sure.

345
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:20,439
- You look wonderful. I always liked...
- The kid says he asked you to marry him.

346
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:22,716
How about it?

347
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,912
I had no idea it was so late.

348
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:32,430
Bob, I want to explain
a little situation to you.

349
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,717
- All right, Pop.
- You see...

350
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,758
- Will you get me back before curfew?
- Sure. Excuse me.

351
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,433
- Good night, Pop.
- Good night.

352
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,795
Good night, Duke.

353
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:47,588
Thanks for the wine.

354
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,072
BOB:
Big night for you.

355
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,798
Yes.

356
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:06,030
I enjoyed it.

357
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,711
He must be a nice guy.

358
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:24,838
Pop wouldn't like him,
and you wouldn't have married him.

359
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,911
So how's it with us?
Still the same?

360
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,555
I wonder if it's ever still the same
when a girl meets her ex-husband.

361
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,399
BOB:
I see what you mean.

362
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:37,553
I'll call you tomorrow.

363
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,597
Please do.

364
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,036
DUKE:
Mary Stuart.

365
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,118
MARY:
Duke.

366
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:03,396
You're still the softest-walking
man I ever heard.

367
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,996
Kid says he asked you
to marry him.

368
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,238
That's right.

369
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,913
Gonna do it?

370
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:11,918
I don't know.

371
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:15,517
He wants to go someplace
where they never heard of the Navy.

372
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:18,114
- And that appeals to you?
- His idea...

373
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,558
...is to fly back to Wichita, Kansas,
start walking inland with a pair of oars...

374
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,870
...and when we get to where
somebody says:

375
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:28,476
"What's that you got on your shoulders?"
That's it.

376
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,590
Just tell me one thing.

377
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,196
When you kiss him,
do you get that old zing?

378
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:38,432
Oh... Now you're talking
like a jealous husband.

379
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,670
Ex-husband,
and don't evade the question.

380
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:42,512
It's not a fair question.

381
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,148
A girl can't spend
the rest of her life kissing.

382
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,517
It's a good thing to fall back on
when you run out of talk.

383
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:53,115
If you wanted to be a nurse, you didn't
have to become a Navy nurse...

384
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:56,352
...and be sent to Pearl,
where you might see me.

385
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:59,472
Duke, I have a life
of my own to live.

386
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,712
I didn't want to live it
being afraid to run into you.

387
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,836
So you ran into me.

388
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,753
What now?

389
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,398
I don't know.

390
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,711
It's not as simple as I thought.

391
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:16,239
It took a war to make me understand...

392
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,312
...or maybe it's just
that I'm four years older...

393
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,835
...but there hasn't been a day
that you weren't with me...

394
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,717
...or a night...

395
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:29,599
...on patrol or ashore...

396
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:34,954
...in town or pushing some kids through
the jungles with a baby in my arms.

397
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,672
- Duke.
- Especially with that baby in my arms.

398
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:43,637
Duke, what good
will that kind of talk do now?

399
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:46,758
I'm trying to convince you
that I want another chance.

400
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:50,318
I haven't much time
to plead my cause.

401
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:01,518
I called a chaplain friend of mine
and asked him to stand by.

402
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,559
We could have a few days together
before I shove off.

403
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:05,755
Wait a minute.

404
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:10,033
I didn't spend these years to be
rushed off my feet by a white uniform...

405
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,236
...a big moon and ginger flowers.

406
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,879
Tree orchids.

407
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:15,393
You know what I mean.

408
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,758
You're thinking about the old zing,
but I'm thinking about the rest of my life.

409
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,638
I can't afford another mistake.

410
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:24,991
The only mistake you made
was in getting that divorce.

411
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,355
We're both grown up now.

412
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,875
We could have grown up together.

413
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,916
Maybe I wasn't around
a lot of times I should have been...

414
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,469
...but I guarantee you
that I'm gonna spend...

415
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:39,393
...all the time I have off duty
making it up to you.

416
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:41,118
CHIEF:
Commander.

417
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,319
Commander.

418
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,717
- What is it, chief?
- I'd like to speak to the commander, sir.

419
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,552
Excuse me, honey.

420
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,190
How did you know where I was?

421
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,398
- Chief.
- Good evening, ma'am.

422
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,835
- Lieutenant.
- Yes, lieutenant, ma'am.

423
00:35:59,000 --> 00:35:59,989
What's the trouble?

424
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:03,035
Well, a bunch of the guys
went to a luau.

425
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,431
You know, a roast pig,
okolehao, fresh from the still...

426
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,828
...uh...

427
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,513
...hula girls...
- Yes, I know.

428
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,116
Well, you know Jonesy. The Hawaiian
police tried to break it up...

429
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,477
...then shore patrol got into it,
and somebody starts swinging.

430
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:19,234
They're being held
at the shore patrol station.

431
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:20,389
A friend phoned me.

432
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:22,238
Couldn't you get them out?

433
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,109
No, ma'am, on account of the Hawaiians.
They want damages.

434
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,792
- This may be serious.
- I know.

435
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,315
You'd better go take care of your Navy.

436
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:35,999
Go ahead.

437
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,832
Remember what I told you.

438
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,560
- I meant it. Let's go, chief.
CHIEF: Yes, sir.

439
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,437
[MEN SINGING]

440
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:09,238
- <i>Thunder</i> crew, belay that racket!
HAWAIIAN: My guitar, commander.

441
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,039
Please, commander. Look at my guitar!

442
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:14,678
Hello, Mick.

443
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,200
- You booked them yet, chief?
MAN 1: Well, no, sir, we...

444
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:24,870
We haven't booked them, because we
haven't figured out all the charges yet.

445
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:27,076
- That bad, huh?
- Worse.

446
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:30,630
- It's hard to believe.
- Do you think they belong in a nursery?

447
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,109
Think I've got them there
for stealing dolls?

448
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:35,157
Give me that report, chief.

449
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,673
"In car number one,
we were cruising near Koko Head."

450
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:41,400
That's five miles
out-of-bounds, incidentally.

451
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:45,314
"Our attention was attracted to a
disturbance involving naval personnel.

452
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:48,438
Investigation disclosed a dozen
of the <i>Thunder</i> crew at a luau.

453
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:53,276
The Hawaiians tried to get them to leave.
They became noisy and belligerent.

454
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,637
When the Hawaiians sent
the hula girls home, a fight started."

455
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,360
I'd like to talk to the man
that made that report.

456
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:01,755
You'll have to go to the naval hospital.

457
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,354
He's in there with five of my best men.

458
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:08,555
You submariners are practically
winning this war single-handed...

459
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,395
...but I don't see how fighting patrolmen
is going to weaken the Japs.

460
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:15,353
There must have been great
provocation for my gang...

461
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,717
...if it was my gang.

The damage to our bow
has cut our surface speed in half.

684
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:44,238
We can submerge,
but we can't make much headway.

685
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,630
Means we'll do most
of our running at night.

What are we waiting for?
That huddle in the wardroom?

691

Board of Investigation has to decide what
happened before anybody goes ashore.

692
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:21,391
A faulty torpedo
cost Capt. Perry his life.

693
00:59:21,560 --> 00:59:23,949
Otherwise, the target
would have been disabled.

694
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:26,588
The <i>Thunder</i> wouldn't have been
forced into a dive.

695
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,478
After the dive...

696
00:59:28,640 --> 00:59:32,872
After the dive, I acted according to my
understanding of the <i>Thunder</i>'s mission...

697
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:36,874
...which was to destroy enemy shipping.
- After the Jap ship went down...

698
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,237
...we cruised the area,
searching for Capt. Perry.

What was the condition
of the <i>Thunder</i> at that time?

Heavily damaged.
Barely able to make headway, sir.

an outstanding submarine feat...

...in getting the <i>Thunder</i> back.
- Thank you.

703

you be sent back to the States.

Looks like a lot of us
had the same idea.

I guess it's up to me
to say something.

717
01:02:02,840 --> 01:02:05,718
The most appropriate thing
I can think of...

718
01:02:06,320 --> 01:02:10,359
...is the last part of the burial at sea
in the <i>Navy Prayer Book.</i>

719

It goes like this:

"We commend their souls to God
and commit their bodies to the deep...

...but he didn't stay down
where it was safe.

730
01:02:46,960 --> 01:02:49,952
He brought it up again to fight. Why?

731
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:52,315
I'm not the only one asking questions.

732
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,436
They're sending him back. Why?

I don't know, Bob...

734
01:02:56,120 --> 01:02:58,759
...but I'm sure Duke did
what he thought was right.

Don't try to defend him, Mary Stuart.

I wanted to tell you about Pop,
how we all felt.

What's the use of talking?

741
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,557
All I can think
of is Pop out there, helpless...

742
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,951
...while you went glory hunting.

743
01:03:34,480 --> 01:03:36,789
Too bad.

Don't be upset, darling.

Let's sit down over here,
and you can tell me what happened.

01:03:43,480 --> 01:03:45,789
In time, Bob will forgive you.

747
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:47,916
Forgive me? For what?

748
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:50,436
We didn't abandon Pop.

749
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:53,068
He ordered the <i>Thunder</i> down,
knowing he couldn't make it.

750
01:03:53,240 --> 01:03:55,196
Knowing she would be under
in a minute.

751
01:03:55,360 --> 01:03:57,715
He gave his life
for his crew and his boat.

752
01:03:57,880 --> 01:04:01,111
Bob doesn't understand that.
After all, Pop was his brother.

753
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,194
And he was my best friend.
I'm gonna miss him.

754
01:04:05,360 --> 01:04:08,875
His kindness and his gruff humor...

755
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:12,828
...but the missing is all mixed-up
with such a fierce pride in what he did...

756
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:15,958
...that I have no room for mourning.
I think Pop understands.

757
01:04:16,120 --> 01:04:18,429
Of course, but that
doesn't lessen the hurt.

Wait a minute. I told you how I feel.

You can't help me in this.

My problem is to stay aboard

I guess I know now where I stand.

767
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:10,709
DUKE: Is the admiral in, Joe?
- Yes, sir. I think he's expecting you.

768
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:17,437
- Capt. Gifford of the <i>Thunderfish,</i> sir.
ADMIRAL: Come in, Duke.

769
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:21,676
- Thank you for seeing me, sir.
- Sit down, relax.

770
01:05:21,840 --> 01:05:23,239
What can I do for you?

771
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:26,198
I would like to talk to you, sir,
about the <i>Thunder.</i>

772
01:05:26,360 --> 01:05:30,035
I could say that the crew
was so well-coordinated...

773
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:33,158
...that it should be kept intact,
and that would be true.

774
01:05:33,320 --> 01:05:37,916
I could tell you about Pop,
and the promise I made to him.

775
01:05:38,080 --> 01:05:40,594
- There's a lot...
- What are you trying to tell me?

776
01:05:40,760 --> 01:05:44,309
- I don't wanna go back to the States.
- You had a strenuous time.

777
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:48,871
I know they said that, sir,
but I thought perhaps you could...

778
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:51,918
Well, there is one possibility
for you to stay.

779
01:05:52,080 --> 01:05:55,117
I've been given permission
to conduct experiments out here.

780
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,714
Find out why our torpedoes
don't explode.

781
01:05:57,880 --> 01:06:00,758
I wouldn't be any good for that, sir.
I'm no theory man.

782
01:06:00,920 --> 01:06:03,434
I'm a line officer.
I belong aboard the <i>Thunder.</i>

783
01:06:03,600 --> 01:06:07,070
You're a practical submariner,
and this is a big job.

784
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,912
However...

785
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,195
MAN:
<i>Flag lieutenant, sir.</i>

786
01:06:10,360 --> 01:06:13,670
Arrange transportation
for Capt. Gifford to the States.

787
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:15,637
I hadn't finished, sir.

788
01:06:15,800 --> 01:06:18,633
What I meant to say was,
I belong aboard a boat...

789
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:22,554
...but I'll do anything I can.

790
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:27,392
I thought you'd feel that way.

791
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:29,119
I gather from Pop's messages...

792
01:06:29,280 --> 01:06:31,350
...that he had ideas
about what was wrong.

793
01:06:31,520 --> 01:06:34,717
Yes, sir. He started to explain
to me but never finished.

794
01:06:34,880 --> 01:06:37,678
Do you think anybody aboard
the <i>Thunder</i> has any ideas?

795
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:39,159
Well, my chief might.

796
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,470
The whole crew are fine torpedo men.

797
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,950
Go in a huddle with the torpedo officer.
See what you can cook up.

798
01:06:45,120 --> 01:06:47,509
- We'll give you all the help we can.
- Thank you.

799
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,035
It's all right, Duke.
Find the answer for me.

800
01:06:50,200 --> 01:06:53,510
You know, I don't enjoy
sending out boats and crews...

801
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:56,478
...with torpedoes
that don't get the job done.

802
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:58,517
Aye, aye, sir.

803
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:25,997
- It looks all right here in the shop.
- But it doesn't explode.

804
01:07:26,160 --> 01:07:28,549
The brain trust has figured out
the force of impact.

805
01:07:28,720 --> 01:07:32,235
If we could approximate the tons
with which this hits the ship...

806
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:36,598
Why don't you take it
up high someplace and drop it?

807
01:08:22,400 --> 01:08:25,517
No luck. Ten straight duds.

808
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:27,955
- That sends me back to the States.
- Me too.

809
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,634
This thing is a must for the admiral.

810
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,314
Chief, is there anything we haven't tried?

811
01:08:33,480 --> 01:08:36,472
No, sir, except
those aluminum firing pins...

812
01:08:36,640 --> 01:08:38,915
...the base sent over,
but they look too light.

813
01:08:39,120 --> 01:08:41,918
DUKE: Put one in.
MAN 1: Yes, sir.

814
01:08:51,440 --> 01:08:53,032
CHIEF:
Stand clear.

815
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:02,879

[EXPLOSION]

MAN 2: That did it, chief.
MAN 3: Yes, sir.

818
01:09:55,800 --> 01:09:59,031
Hold it right there. Turn around,
and give me all the angles.

819
01:09:59,240 --> 01:10:02,437
Then get your hat, coat and gloves
because we're going out.

820
01:10:02,640 --> 01:10:05,632
- I've got something to say.
- But do you have to say it now?

821
01:10:05,800 --> 01:10:08,633
- I've got big things...
- Yes. I'm not going to enjoy it...

822
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,635
...and I want to get it over with.
No, please don't touch me. Just listen.

823
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,759
The last time I saw you was probably
the most unselfish moment in my life.

824
01:10:17,920 --> 01:10:21,674
I was practically glowing
with things I wanted to do for you...

825
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,400
...but you didn't give me a chance.
- I'm sorry...

826
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:27,313
Now everything's cleared up.
You want somebody to howl with you.

827
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:31,598
- I don't want just somebody, I want you.
- I'm not available, Duke.

828
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:37,039
That night in front of the nurses' quarters
and then again at the pier...

829
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:40,636
...I forgot for the moment
why we split up...

830
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,758
...but you reminded me,
and the trouble came charging back.

831
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:47,799
It wasn't the Navy, the wet winters,
the bad quarters or you being away.

832
01:10:48,840 --> 01:10:51,400
Those things made it wonderful
when you got home.

833
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:55,314
Sure, we did.
We had some great times together...

834
01:10:55,480 --> 01:11:00,429
...but a marriage isn't all laughs.
I wanted to cry with you sometimes too.

835
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:04,479
I wanted to comfort you
when you lost your best friend...

836
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:07,839
...but you wouldn't let me.

837
01:11:09,360 --> 01:11:12,989
I wanted to comfort you
when we lost our son...

838
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:17,358
...but you went off into some corner
of your own, never realizing...

839
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:21,069
...by comforting you,
I could have helped my own grief.

840
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,430
Maybe it's my fault.

841
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,114
Maybe I shouldn't have
let you shut me out...

842
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,350
...but you have no corner on pride, Duke.

843
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:37,116
If I can't be a part of everything
in your life, I can't be a part of anything.

844
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:42,428
So there is...

845
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,713
...trouble between us.

846
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:48,833
You don't need me, Duke.

847
01:11:49,200 --> 01:11:51,589
You never have.

848
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:56,756
You don't need anybody but yourself.

849
01:12:20,440 --> 01:12:23,477
- Fine boy.
- Yeah.

850
01:12:23,640 --> 01:12:26,108
Take good care of him, will you?

851
01:12:26,280 --> 01:12:27,952
A man has got a lot to learn.

852

[BABY CRIES]

853
01:12:59,400 --> 01:13:03,029
STEELE: I heard every word you said.
I've been trying to keep my nose out...

854
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:06,397
...but I can't stand by
and watch you make a fool of yourself.

855
01:13:06,560 --> 01:13:10,348
- Cmdr. Steele, I know...
- Keep quiet and listen.

856
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:14,309
Of course he comes to you
when he wants to play.

857
01:13:14,480 --> 01:13:16,789
Where do you want him to go,
some other woman?

858
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:20,839
You married him for what he is and
tried to make something else out of him.

859
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:25,039
When you couldn't, and you never will,
you began to feel sorry for yourself.

860
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:28,510
How long would you love him
if he did cry on your shoulder?

861
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,513
"You don't need me."
"I shouldn't have let you shut me out."

862
01:13:31,680 --> 01:13:35,798
What kind of silly talk is that?
And what has pride got to do with love?

863
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,636
Don't worry. He won't be happy...

864
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:43,469
...but what is more important,
he won't be back.

865
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,429
DUKE:
Keep your seat.

866
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:25,912
What's the matter, Junior?
Getting some fresh air?

01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:27,593
No, sir.

868
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:30,638
I was just sitting up here,
thinking about women.

869
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:33,519
How you miss them
till you get ashore...

870
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,955
...and then how you wonder why.

871
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:41,797
- How soon you start missing them again.
- I reckon it's just a vicious circle.

872
01:14:41,960 --> 01:14:45,111
That's a cynical observation
for a gentleman from Georgia.

873
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:47,550
- Alabama, sir.
- Oh, I beg your pardon.

874
01:14:47,720 --> 01:14:50,280
Of course, sir.

There's a lot of you corn bread
and buttermilk boys in the Navy...

to be sailor country.

01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,637
Oh, but it is, sir.

878
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,028
From way back.

My grandpappy
was with Dewey at Manila.

881
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:10,879
My pappy was with Adm. Sims
chasing U-boats.

882
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:15,238
Why, even the town I come from
is named Decatur.

883
01:15:22,200 --> 01:15:24,430
Indications lead to an all-out
Japanese effort...

884
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:27,751
...to destroy the recently obtained
United States base at Leyte...

885
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:30,559
...and prevent support and supply
by our fleet.

886
01:15:30,720 --> 01:15:34,679
The Imperial Japanese fleet is known
to have left its base, headed south.

Several courses are open to them.

Consequently, initial contact
is of vital importance.

The Philippine landing
was a ticklish job.

Sixty days.
Didn't even see a rowboat.

Did you guys bring
any new pictures with you?

- Well, send it over...

905
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:49,991
...and you can have

- Sure!

go up to Room 202.

under the pillow, it's mine.

If there's a buck under the pillow,
I'll split it with you.

All hands, this is Jonesy.
There will be movies tonight.
