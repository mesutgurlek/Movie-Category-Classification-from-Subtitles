19
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:48,600
Three days have passed since
the hostilities at JSA.

20
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:48,600


21
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,900
Efforts to hold a joint investigation
between the Koreas have failed,

22
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,000


23
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,300
but recently negotiators
achieved a key breakthrough.

24
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:55,400


25
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:59,300
Authorities from both countries
have agreed this afternoon

26
00:01:59,300 --> 00:01:59,400


27
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:03,300
to comply with an
investigation by the NNSC.

28
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,400


29
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,500
Tensions have been running high

30
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:05,600


31
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,300
amid suspicions of a
Northern nuclear program

32
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:08,400


33
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:13,400
and the advance of U.S.
naval vessels into the East Sea.

34
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:13,400


35
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:19,500
Both Koreas recognize the need

36
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:19,600


37
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:24,700
to handle the recent conflict
calmly and objectively,

38
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:24,800


39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:30,800
and to avoid having this
trivial matter escalate into war.

40
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:30,900


41
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,500
In accordance with the agreement,
the NNSC is planning to dispatch

42
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:34,500


43
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:38,100
Swiss and Swedish law officers
with practical experience in this field.

44
00:02:38,100 --> 00:05:52,300


45
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:55,100
If a battle starts,
shoot the bastards.

46
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,700


47
00:05:55,700 --> 00:05:57,000
You couldn't kill even one?

48
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:57,100


49
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:59,200
You call yourself a soldier?

50
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:00,500


51
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,800
I thought my primary mission
was to rescue Sergeant Lee.

52
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:03,800


53
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,700
So?

54
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:05,000


55
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
So that's why you
couldn't aim straight?

56
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:09,200


57
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,100
Was your order to
shoot down trees?

58
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,100


59
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,900
My order was to scare them off
and give cover to the rescue team.

60
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:13,900


61
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,700
What?

62
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:14,800


63
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,700
You sure you weren't
the one scared off?

64
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:19,800


65
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,300
I didn't want to start a war, sir.

66
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:22,400


67
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,700
What? A soldier afraid of war?

68
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:25,900


69
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:26,900
You stupid...

70
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,700


71
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,700
What?

72
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,300


73
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,200
Reporting, sir!

74
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:43,500


75
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,800
War doesn't break out that easily.

76
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:45,900


77
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:46,800
Now go.

78
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,000


79
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:48,900
Yes, sir!

80
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,300


81
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,600
This incident...

82
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:54,800


83
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,000
...isn't it rather obvious?

84
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,300


85
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,300
Some commies kidnap our soldier,

86
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:03,400


87
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:07,400
and claim he crossed over voluntarily.

88
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:07,500


89
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,700
- Am I right?
- Correct, sir!

90
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,200


91
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,000
Our boy... what's your name again?

92
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,300


93
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:18,200
Sergeant Lee Soo Hyuk, sir!
Right, Soo Hyuk.

94
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,300


95
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:21,200
Let's wrap this up quickly so Soo Hyuk
can take a leave of absence.

96
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,800


97
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,800
Our boy here took out
two of the bastards.

98
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:26,800


99
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,300
He's a hero!

100
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,500


101
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,600
Wouldn't you say, Major Jean?

102
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,500


103
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:35,300
Your opinion will be noted
in the investigation.

104
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:37,800


105
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:42,500
The NNSC will now be
taking custody of the suspect.

106
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,400


107
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,600
No South Korean military officials
may enter without my permission.

108
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:59,000


109
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,900
Neutral Nations
Supervisory Commission?

110
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:05,000


111
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,900
There are two kinds
of people in this world.

112
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:07,000


113
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,800
Commie bastards...

114
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:08,800


115
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,700
and the Commie bastards' enemies.

116
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,000


117
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,400
Neutral has no place here.

118
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,800


119
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,400
You have to choose sides.

120
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,800


121
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,300
You're from law school, right?

122
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,400


123
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,100
I trust you'll make a wise choice.

124
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:28,900


125
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,400
I'm Major Sophie Jean from Switzerland.

126
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:31,500


127
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,900
This is Captain Perrson from Sweden.

128
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:37,500


129
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,900
He's still in shock.

130
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,500


131
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,700
He was hit with a blunt object.

132
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:43,300


133
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:46,300
That bruise proves
that he was kidnapped.

134
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:54,800


135
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,300
- Deposition -

136
00:08:57,300 --> 00:10:37,100


137
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,100
Get down!

138
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:38,800


139
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,400
He looks like one of ours!

140
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:49,200


141
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,100
Soo Hyuk! Soo Hyuk!

142
00:10:51,100 --> 00:11:53,600


143
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,400
Right over the
Military Demarcation Line.

144
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,200


145
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,400
Doesn't it seem a bit acted out?

146
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:03,400


147
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,800
This is where Lieutenant
Choi's body was found.

148
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,700


149
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,300
And that's where Private Jung fell.

150
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,500


151
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:19,900
A basement bunker...

152
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:33,300


153
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,700
Private Jung was a talented artist.

154
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:36,800


155
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,600
He even won a prize in a national contest.

156
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,400


157
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:47,200
He was popular among the soldiers
for drawing their girlfriends.

158
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:47,700


159
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,600
RICE IS COMMUNISM

160
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,700


161
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:53,300
As soon as Lee Soo Hyuk
left our post,

162
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:53,400


163
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,800
Southern soldiers
stormed in as if on cue.

164
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:57,700


165
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:01,900
It's a good thing that
Sergeant Oh survived.

166
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,000


167
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:05,900
Otherwise the South would
go on spouting lies,

168
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,000


169
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,700
calling it a
North Korean provocation.

170
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,100


171
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,200
That's exactly what
they're saying now.

172
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:12,800


173
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,500
Who's going to believe it?

174
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:14,600


175
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,300
We have a witness.

176
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:25,000


177
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
Don't get up.

178
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,600


179
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,700
This is Major Jean from the NNSC.

180
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:37,700


181
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,700
Are you okay?

182
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,100


183
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,800
No big deal. It's nothing.

184
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,000


185
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,300
This is from a terrorist in Libya.

186
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:48,400


187
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:50,000
Sliced me with his knife.

188
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,100


189
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:55,100
Once in Egypt, I had to scrape
out shrapnel with a gun spike.

190
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,300


191
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,500
Wanna see?

192
00:13:56,500 --> 00:14:00,200


193
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,000
Really?

194
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,000


195
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,900
Shall we take a look?

196
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:10,000


197
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,500
I'm glad you're okay.

198
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:14,100


199
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,200
Now then, can you
tell me about that night?

200
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,700


201
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,500
It's all in my deposition.

202
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,100


203
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:25,500
You mean the deposition you
made and signed while barely conscious?

204
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,300


205
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,700
Stupid wench.

206
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:32,800


207
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,600
What did you just say?

208
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,400


209
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:42,100
Why is it you all have depositions,
but nobody will talk to me?

210
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:49,100


211
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:51,800
Hey Lieutenant,
tell us about your vacation.

212
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,200


213
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,400
It was the same as any other.

214
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:53,600


215
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:55,800
It was nothing special.

216
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:24,300


217
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:25,300
Get down!

218
00:15:25,300 --> 00:16:13,600


219
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,000
Shot twice.

220
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,600


221
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,200
Once in the right chest,

222
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,300


223
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:21,000
crushing the ribs
and passing through the lung.

224
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,600


225
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,200
But that wasn't the fatal shot.

226
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:33,500


227
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:35,500
The second one was the real killer.

228
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:39,500


229
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:42,300
Judging from the angle,
it was shot at point blank.

230
00:16:42,300 --> 00:17:07,800


231
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,200
As for the next one...

232
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:12,400


233
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,100
A total of eight shots.

234
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,200


235
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,100
Unbelievable...

236
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:17,900


237
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:21,500
Shot from such a close range,
they went right through him.

238
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:21,600


239
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,500
The first shot hit his face,
probably killing him instantly.

240
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:25,600


241
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:30,200
The rest were just
shot into a dead body.

242
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:53,900


243
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:56,000
Lee Soo Hyuk.

244
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:56,900


245
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,300
Now there's a man.

246
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:01,300


247
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,100
I can see that.

248
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,200


249
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,100
Once while he was on duty,

250
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,600


251
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,500
those guys over there
cursed our president.

252
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,000


253
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,800
When Soo Hyuk heard this,

254
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:10,900


255
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,800
He took a rock and
smashed their window.

256
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,100


257
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,500
So I rounded up my
men and then told him

258
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:19,800


259
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,800
''All right! Way to go!''

260
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:22,200


261
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,300
Once he got left behind
on a search mission.

262
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:26,700


263
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:29,900
Man, the squad was in uproar.

264
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:30,300


265
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:34,600
Four hours later he shows up again.

266
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:36,500


267
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,900
Says he stepped on a mine
and had to dismantle it.

268
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,100


269
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,400
Damn!

270
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:42,500


271
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:45,700
Anyway, I knew then.

272
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,900


273
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:51,200
This guy, he's something else.

274
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:51,300


275
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,200
Nerves of steel, I tell you.

276
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:53,300


277
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,600
Nam Sung Shik,

278
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:55,700


279
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,400
you were on duty with Sergeant
Lee on the day of the incident.

280
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:00,900


281
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,200
- Right?
- Yes, ma'am!

282
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,700


283
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,200
I'm not deaf.

284
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,200


285
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,700
Why did Sergeant Lee go out alone?

286
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,900


287
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,700
An urgent call of nature.

288
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,000


289
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,500
Can a soldier leave
his post for that?

290
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:22,300


291
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,600
He said people with constipation

292
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:25,700


293
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:28,300
should seize a chance
when it comes.

294
00:19:28,300 --> 00:20:33,700


295
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,100
Please load the gun
as you would normally.

296
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:39,200


297
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,200
So you refuse to say anything?

298
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:44,800


299
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,600
I visited the North side
and saw the corpses.

300
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,800


301
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:55,200
If you just wanted to escape,
why shoot a man 8 times?

302
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,300


303
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,900
I brought photos of the bodies.
Do you want to see them?

304
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,300


305
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,200
No.

306
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,100


307
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:03,600
I don't want to see them.

308
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,000


309
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,600
You've got a nice voice.

310
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:49,700


311
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:53,500
Your fellow soldiers say you're
very quick with the gun.

312
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:53,500


313
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,000
Are you really that fast?

314
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,100


315
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,600
Will you show me?

316
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:59,700


317
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,400
What's important in
battle isn't speed.

318
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,500


319
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:10,600
It's carrying yourself
with composure and bravery.

320
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,500


321
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,600
That's everything.

322
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,000


323
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Alright, then.

324
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,200


325
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:20,100
Can you load the gun
again, just like before?

326
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:27,200


327
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,300
Are you really a Swiss soldier?

328
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:34,200


329
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:38,600
Does Sergeant Lee talk much
about army life?

330
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:40,600


331
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:44,000
He tries to, but I don't let him.

332
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:44,400


333
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,100
Has he ever talked
about, for example...

334
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:47,200


335
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,300
How he went
on any missions,

336
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:50,400


337
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,000
or if he got special training?

338
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,000


339
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,300
Special training?

340
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,400


341
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,900
Can you zip me up?

342
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,000


343
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:03,100
Soo Jung, you don't
worry about Sergeant Lee?

344
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,800


345
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:07,700
We're not really that serious.

346
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:10,700


347
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:14,100
What kind of person is he, in a word?

348
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:14,900


349
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,300
Well...

350
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:16,300


351
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,700
Oh, you can tell by
how he treats my brother.

352
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:20,900


353
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:25,300
Since we were kids my brother
never had many friends.

354
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:25,300


355
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:29,200
But after enlisting, things got
much better, thanks to Soo-Hyuk.

356
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:29,300


357
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,100
He's very warm-hearted.

358
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:32,200


359
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:35,000
Probably because he grew
up poor, like us.

360
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:35,000


361
00:23:35,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Wait a second...

362
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:37,000


363
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,600
Your brother?

364
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:38,600


365
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,100
You didn't know?

366
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:40,200


367
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,900
Private Nam Sung Shik,
they're in the same platoon.

368
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:44,000


369
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,900
He kept asking me to
meet Soo Hyuk, so I did.

370
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:52,900


371
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,900
What?

372
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:57,200


373
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,400
Is there something on my face?

374
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:00,000


375
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,700
No, not at all.

376
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:26,100


377
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:30,800
There were 11 bullet wounds on
the three North Korean soldiers.

378
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:31,500


379
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,100
10 bullets were recovered at the scene,

380
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:34,200


381
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,300
but one was never found.

382
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,100


383
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,600
It's a missing bullet.

384
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,100


385
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:43,500
There were 5 left in your gun.

386
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,600


387
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:49,600
If you add these up,
5 and 10 make 15.

388
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,600


389
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,100
Since you aren't in the habit
of loading an extra bullet,

390
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:54,200


391
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:58,500
15 matches the number
you had to begin with.

392
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:58,500


393
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,900
Then,

394
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,500


395
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:03,000
what's this one bullet?

396
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,300


397
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:07,600
It was neither shot by you
nor recovered later.

398
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:07,700


399
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:10,200
Yet it pierced through
a soldier's body.

400
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,900


401
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:16,600
If someone hid the bullet,

402
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:16,700


403
00:25:16,700 --> 00:25:20,100
it means he's afraid it might
reveal whose gun fired it.

404
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:20,900


405
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,900
In other words,
there was someone else,

406
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:22,900


407
00:25:22,900 --> 00:25:25,400
a fifth person at the scene.

408
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,400


409
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,100
What do you think of my theory?

410
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:35,400


411
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:40,400
Sometimes they set fires on
the DMZ for good visibility.

412
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,900


413
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:45,500
One night we burned
a reed field.

414
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,400


415
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:52,900
And all the mines blew up like fireworks.

416
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,000


417
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:56,000
Then, another time...

418
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:56,000


419
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,900
Was Private Nam with you then, too?

420
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:09,200


421
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:12,300
This is the beretta you had
when you were rescued.

422
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,600


423
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,500
Everyone assumed that
this was your gun.

424
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:21,900


425
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,600
I requested an inquiry
on the serial number.

426
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:23,700


427
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,500
This gun belongs to Private Nam.

428
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,000


429
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:32,600
Pvt. Nam said his gun broke during
the rescue and fired only once.

430
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,900


431
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:38,600
The beretta M-9 is an automatic,

432
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:38,700


433
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:42,100
so the slide cocks back
after each shot.

434
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,000


435
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,700
It broke right here.

436
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,200


437
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,200
You know all this, right?
You're the weapons expert.

438
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:49,800


439
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,500
I inspected the gun registered to
you that Private Nam returned.

440
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:53,900


441
00:26:53,900 --> 00:27:02,200
An antimony-barium reaction on the
gun revealed more than just gunpowder.

442
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:02,200


443
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,500
Bloodstains.

444
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:12,300


445
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:17,200
After the first shot, the slide
retracted and then stuck.

446
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,100


447
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:25,300
And blood from a body
splattered right here.

448
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,100


449
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,000
and blood splattered
right here.

450
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,700


451
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:36,000
The analysis results matched
with Private Jung's blood sample.

452
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,600


453
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,600
The bloodstains right here...

454
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:40,600


455
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:44,800
weren't visible, and so they
weren't wiped off.

456
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:50,000


457
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,300
Sergeant Lee, have you heard
of the Keeler Polygraph

458
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,500


459
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,900
Also known as a lie detector.

460
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:13,900


461
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,900
Yes?

462
00:28:14,900 --> 00:29:51,300


463
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,600
Thank you.

464
00:29:52,600 --> 00:30:52,900


465
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:56,100
Here's checkpoint 2.

466
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:56,900


467
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,400
And this is checkpoint 3?

468
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,500


469
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,900
Hey, what are the
coordinates here again?

470
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,300


471
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:06,800
If we're here...

472
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:06,900


473
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,400
We're at checkpoint 3, sir.

474
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,700


475
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,500
Those coordinates aren't on the map.

476
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:28,200


477
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,400
Are you saying we crossed over?

478
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:35,100


479
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,600
Give me that.

480
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:49,000


481
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,800
We're fucked.

482
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,700


483
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,000
Retreat quickly, 5 o'clock!

484
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:41,400


485
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:42,900
Sergeant Hwang!

486
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:45,000


487
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,400
Sergeant Choi!

488
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,800


489
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:51,200
Help me...

490
00:32:51,200 --> 00:34:44,900


491
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:48,900
I told you not to bring that
damn dog, you stupid shit!

492
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,000


493
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:50,000
I didn't bring him!

494
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:50,100


495
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,500
You shut up.

496
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:51,500


497
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,400
I'm stepping on a mine.

498
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:57,500


499
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,300
We could all die.

500
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,200


501
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,500
Watch out! Careful, there...

502
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,800


503
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,900
Don't come any closer!

504
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:06,300


505
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:10,100
One more step, and I'll trip the wire.

506
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:21,800


507
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:24,100
Hey assholes!

508
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:24,400


509
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,100
You just gonna leave me here?

510
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:29,400


511
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:31,300
You told us to go.

512
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:33,000


513
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:38,100
I said don't come closer, when did
I say to leave, you fuckers!

514
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:43,000


515
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,600
Save me!

516
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:50,700


517
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,400
A grown man,
crying like a baby...

518
00:35:54,400 --> 00:36:10,200


519
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,200
Sergeant Oh!

520
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:13,200


521
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,900
What if...

522
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,100


523
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:21,900
Let's just go.

524
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,000


525
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:22,300
Okay?

526
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,200


527
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,600
Take it.
It's a gift.

528
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:53,700


529
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,800
Let's go.

530
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,700


531
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,100
You too, puppy.

532
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,200


533
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,300
Watch yourself now.

534
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:04,200


535
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:08,000
About that mine...
Don't even talk to me.

536
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:08,100


537
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:10,700
What?
Just out to save yourself...

538
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:10,800


539
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:13,500
Well, it was just...

540
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:25,000


541
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:27,500
Rabbit...

542
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:35,400


543
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,500
Rabbit!

544
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,300


545
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:40,600
We got your rabbit's
dick right here!

546
00:37:40,600 --> 00:39:25,400


547
00:39:25,400 --> 00:39:27,300
Hey, hey.

548
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,300


549
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:31,300
Your shadow's over the line.

550
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:31,400


551
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:32,400
Watch it.

552
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:51,400


553
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,100
You writing to Soo Jung?

554
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,100


555
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,200
Yeah.

556
00:39:56,200 --> 00:40:06,200


557
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:10,100
I didn't thank you for
your help last time.

558
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:10,100


559
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:13,100
It was rude of me, brother.

560
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:13,100


561
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,500
Oh, can I call you brother?

562
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:14,600


563
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,700
I've always wanted a brother.

564
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:16,700


565
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:20,400
''After hearing 'comrade' all the time,

566
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:20,500


567
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,800
it's nice to be called brother.''

568
00:40:23,800 --> 00:40:23,900


569
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:26,700
''My hobby is baseball.

570
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:26,800


571
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,900
I was a pitcher in high school.''

572
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:36,700


573
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:40,400
''I'm enjoying the tape you sent me.

574
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:40,400


575
00:40:40,400 --> 00:40:45,900
Han Dae Su was hard to take
at first, but I like it now.

576
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:45,900


577
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:48,500
Kim Hyun Shik is good, too.

578
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,600


579
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:55,200
But don't you have any
female singers down there?''

580
00:40:55,200 --> 00:42:11,100


581
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,700
I didn't mean it...

582
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:13,700


583
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:17,700
I thought I'd write to
him too, as a joke...

584
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:18,300


585
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:20,500
I never thought he'd actually come.

586
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:20,600


587
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,700
What kind of a crazy fool would...

588
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:27,500


589
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,900
Good-bye, then.

590
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,700


591
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:34,000
Wait, I didn't mean for you to go.

592
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:36,600


593
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,200
You've done a great thing.

594
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:39,900


595
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:42,500
After half a century of division,

596
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:42,600


597
00:42:42,600 --> 00:42:45,500
you have breached our tragic history
of agony and disgrace,

598
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:45,600


599
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:50,800
broken the dam to reunify
our country. Comrade Lee Soo Hyuk!

600
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:50,900


601
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,200
We welcome you.

602
00:42:52,200 --> 00:43:00,800


603
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:02,100
I'm sorry.

604
00:43:02,100 --> 00:43:20,300


605
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:21,400
You got a promotion?

606
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:21,500


607
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,900
Thanks to me you've lived
to become sergeant, right?

608
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:25,000


609
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:27,200
If I died, I'd have moved
up to staff sergeant.

610
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:27,800


611
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:30,600
Imagine if I'd had the nerve
to remove my foot?

612
00:43:30,600 --> 00:43:30,700


613
00:43:30,700 --> 00:43:32,700
I'm the one who saved your lives.

614
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:32,900


615
00:43:32,900 --> 00:43:35,100
You're full of shit.

616
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:35,700


617
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:38,200
Move your army out of the way.

618
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:38,400


619
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:41,800
Then we can go head to head
with those damn Yankees.

620
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:42,500


621
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:45,700
Only two years and two months?

622
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:45,800


623
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:50,200
Damn, we serve for 13 years!

624
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,800


625
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,200
I'm pretty quick with the gun.

626
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:54,300


627
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,700
I'm bored all the time
so I practice a lot.

628
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:57,800


629
00:43:57,800 --> 00:43:59,800
That water pistol?

630
00:43:59,800 --> 00:43:59,800


631
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:03,100
Hey, just quit pissing
your pants around mines.

632
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:19,600


633
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:22,200
Yeah, you're pretty fast.

634
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:26,500


635
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,600
But have you...

636
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:39,500


637
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,700
ever shot a man before?

638
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:42,600


639
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,800
No.

640
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:44,200


641
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:47,200
I have, several times.
Alright.

642
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:50,600


643
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:54,200
Okay.
Please Stop.

644
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:54,800


645
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,300
Our comrade's been everywhere

646
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:57,400


647
00:44:57,400 --> 00:45:03,700
Africa, the Middle East...
He trained soldiers for 10 years!

648
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:03,800


649
00:45:03,800 --> 00:45:05,200
You didn't know, did you?

650
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:05,300


651
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,100
That's right, huh?

652
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:06,500


653
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,200
Hey, Sergeant Lee.

654
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:11,600


655
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:14,800
What's important in battle isn't speed.

656
00:45:14,800 --> 00:45:14,900


657
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,300
Combat skills? No such thing.

658
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:17,600


659
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:23,400
It's carrying yourself
with composure and strength.

660
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:23,500


661
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:25,600
That's everything.

662
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:26,500


663
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:34,000
Then what's a great soldier like you
doing guarding this post at your age?

664
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:38,800


665
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:43,700
Hey! You still have that
mine fuse I gave you?

666
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:43,700


667
00:45:43,700 --> 00:45:45,400
Don't lose it.

668
00:45:45,400 --> 00:45:46,100


669
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:49,100
A Hold onto that and
even bullets will pass you by.

670
00:45:49,100 --> 00:46:17,900


671
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:19,000
Whoa!

672
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:19,400


673
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,700
Why do you always go
crazy over American things?

674
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,200


675
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,400
Try it, and you'll see
why Yankee stuff is so great.

676
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:28,500


677
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:30,200
Must've been expensive.

678
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,200


679
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:35,400
It's also good for picking
stuff out of your teeth.

680
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:49,100


681
00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:50,600
Lay down.

682
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:51,800


683
00:46:51,800 --> 00:46:53,600
I said lay down!

684
00:46:53,600 --> 00:47:19,100


685
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:20,800
See?

686
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:20,900


687
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:24,300
I told you about this American shit...

688
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:34,500


689
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,200
What are you doing there
away from your post?

690
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:37,300


691
00:47:37,300 --> 00:47:39,800
It's not that, we were...

692
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:39,900


693
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,200
You idiot!

694
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:44,400


695
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:48,800
You think you're something
because you've been abroad?

696
00:47:48,800 --> 00:48:02,700


697
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:04,700
You think this is a playground?

698
00:48:04,700 --> 00:48:04,800


699
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:07,800
You're at the very front line
of our republic! The front line!

700
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:08,800


701
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,800
Hey. Take that damn
dog to the butchers.

702
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:12,800


703
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:13,800
Lunch for tomorrow.

704
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:13,900


705
00:48:13,900 --> 00:48:14,800
What?!

706
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:16,300


707
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,600
Our people count on us.

708
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,900


709
00:48:21,900 --> 00:48:24,700
Don't let them down, okay?

710
00:48:24,700 --> 00:48:39,900


711
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,500
Take care of yourself.

712
00:48:41,500 --> 00:48:43,900


713
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:45,100
Go on.

714
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:50,300


715
00:48:50,300 --> 00:48:52,900
Watch out for landmines.

716
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,600


717
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:57,900
Go!

718
00:48:57,900 --> 00:48:59,000


719
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,600
I said go!

720
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:03,600


721
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:04,600
Hey! Hey!

722
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:04,700


723
00:49:04,700 --> 00:49:09,000
There's more food
on the other side!

724
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,500


725
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:14,500
That guy's so funny.

726
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,900


727
00:49:15,900 --> 00:49:17,200
Sergeant Lee.

728
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:25,400


729
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,200
You're really handsome.

730
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:28,800


731
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:30,300
Tell me something I don't know.

732
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:31,300


733
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:36,300
Spit it out.
You expect me to read your mind?

734
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,200


735
00:49:38,200 --> 00:49:41,100
Must be nice. Only three
months left to serve.

736
00:49:41,100 --> 00:49:41,800


737
00:49:41,800 --> 00:49:43,500
Nope, 87 days.

738
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:46,800


739
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:51,700
I'm worried about the
rest of my time here.

740
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:57,700


741
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:01,600
Hey, you want me to introduce
you to some friends?

742
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,800


743
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:05,000
Who?

744
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:10,100


745
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:10,900
Nah...

746
00:50:10,900 --> 00:50:11,000


747
00:50:11,000 --> 00:50:13,300
Forget it.

748
00:50:13,300 --> 00:51:32,800


749
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:35,700
Do I have to go?

750
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,100


751
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,600
What?

752
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:40,000


753
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,800
Hey, after half a century of division...

754
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:44,900


755
00:51:44,900 --> 00:51:51,100
Um... overcoming our history
of agony and disgrace,

756
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:52,100


757
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:56,600
We're gonna open the dam
to reunification. Okay?

758
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:57,500


759
00:51:57,500 --> 00:51:59,900
Could we maybe open it later?

760
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:11,100


761
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:13,000
I've heard a lot about you.

762
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:13,700


763
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,300
I'm Oh Kyung Pil.

764
00:52:15,300 --> 00:52:24,900


765
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:27,300
Hey. Private Nam.

766
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:39,800


767
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,300
You feel warm.

768
00:52:41,300 --> 00:53:05,100


769
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:08,300
Ah! Feels warm.

770
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:15,500


771
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:17,300
Sergeant Lee.

772
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:25,500


773
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:26,300
Come on.

774
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:26,400


775
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:30,700
What's wrong with people
of the same blood

776
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:30,700


777
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,700
getting together and
playing some games?

778
00:53:33,700 --> 00:53:33,800


779
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:37,400
Is that such a crime?
I mean, did we commit adultery?

780
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:37,400


781
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:39,900
Or give up military secrets?

782
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:40,900


783
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,700
We don't even know any secrets.

784
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:42,800


785
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,000
Exactly!

786
00:53:44,000 --> 00:55:04,700


787
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,600
Southern army...

788
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:04,700


789
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,100
Out of the way...

790
00:55:06,100 --> 00:55:06,300


791
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:07,200
That's it!

792
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:17,100


793
00:55:17,100 --> 00:55:20,000
Damn! I told you we
should use pebbles!

794
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:20,300


795
00:55:20,300 --> 00:55:22,900
What's so hard about this?

796
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:26,600


797
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:29,000
Wow! It's standing!

798
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:47,300


799
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,600
Brother.

800
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:50,700


801
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:52,800
Pay up.

802
00:55:52,800 --> 00:56:00,400


803
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:03,100
My father died young.

804
00:56:03,100 --> 00:56:03,200


805
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:05,700
So I'm the only man in the house.

806
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:08,000


807
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,400
Wow...

808
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:10,500


809
00:56:10,500 --> 00:56:11,700
She's pretty.

810
00:56:11,700 --> 00:56:13,000


811
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:14,400
Is she really yours?

812
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,900


813
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:21,800
Don't you have anyone, brother?
Come on, show us!

814
00:56:21,800 --> 00:57:27,700


815
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:31,000
What?
Don't be ridiculous.

816
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:31,500


817
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:36,800
But remember what
that soldier who defected said?

818
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:36,900


819
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:41,500
Guards at the border are trained
to draw us to their side.

820
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,700


821
00:57:42,700 --> 00:57:44,600
You're wrong.

822
00:57:44,600 --> 00:57:47,800


823
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:50,000
He saved my life.

824
00:57:50,000 --> 00:58:10,200


825
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,500
Brother.

826
00:58:11,500 --> 00:58:12,800


827
00:58:12,800 --> 00:58:18,500
Why can't our republic make
moon pies like this?

828
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,800


829
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,400
Brother!

830
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:27,400


831
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:31,000
I was just wondering...

832
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:33,200


833
00:58:33,200 --> 00:58:34,800
Don't you want to come down South?

834
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:41,800


835
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:46,500
You can eat Choco Pies
till you burst.

836
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:54,400


837
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,300
I mean, only if you want to.

838
00:58:56,300 --> 00:59:02,300


839
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:04,000
Lee Soo Hyuk.

840
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:04,000


841
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:08,400
I'm only going to say
this once, so listen well.

842
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:09,800


843
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:13,000
My dream is...

844
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:13,100


845
00:59:13,100 --> 00:59:15,600
That one day, our republic...

846
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:15,600


847
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:20,300
makes the best damn
sweets on this peninsula.

848
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:20,900


849
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,100
Got it?

850
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:29,100


851
00:59:29,100 --> 00:59:32,400
Until then, all I can do is...

852
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:32,400


853
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:35,600
dream about these Choco Pies.

854
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:39,000


855
00:59:39,000 --> 00:59:44,400
Forget it. You're all talk.

856
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:45,000


857
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Stop it.

858
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:48,100


859
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,000
Don't!

860
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:51,200


861
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:53,400
Sung Shik, stop these
Commie bastards!

862
00:59:53,400 --> 01:00:25,000


863
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:28,800
You don't need to rub it,
just wipe it on with this.

864
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:28,900


865
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,300
Take them off.

866
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:32,500


867
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:34,800
First, shake it well like this.

868
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:34,900


869
01:00:34,900 --> 01:00:37,900
Then you just spread it on.

870
01:00:37,900 --> 01:00:40,500


871
01:00:40,500 --> 01:00:44,400
This is how you do it. Like this.

872
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:44,400


873
01:00:44,400 --> 01:00:48,300
Then after it dries, do it again.

874
01:00:48,300 --> 01:01:09,400


875
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:14,400
Alert! Alert!

876
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:16,700


877
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:19,600
Hey! Hurry up over there!

878
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,200


879
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:23,900
Move your asses!

880
01:01:23,900 --> 01:01:39,800


881
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,900
At 02:35,

882
01:01:41,900 --> 01:01:42,000


883
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:46,700
we obtained word that

884
01:01:46,700 --> 01:01:46,800


885
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:49,700
Northern troops are massing
along the entire border.

886
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:50,800


887
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:52,500
We're at DEFCON 3.

888
01:01:52,500 --> 01:02:07,300


889
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:10,300
Hey!
You chicken?

890
01:02:10,300 --> 01:02:12,200


891
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,300
Keep your cool, okay?

892
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:15,400


893
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:17,400
Just think of it as
shooting off a round.

894
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:17,400


895
01:02:17,400 --> 01:02:20,200
That's all it is, alright?

896
01:02:20,200 --> 01:04:09,000


897
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,600
Sung Shik.

898
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:10,800


899
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:15,600
Let's not go over anymore.

900
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:23,200


901
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:26,800
It'll be Jung's birthday soon.

902
01:04:26,800 --> 01:04:26,900


903
01:04:26,900 --> 01:04:28,900
And you're almost out.

904
01:04:28,900 --> 01:04:31,100


905
01:04:31,100 --> 01:04:34,400
We should at least say goodbye.

906
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:46,300


907
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:49,300
After I'm out,

908
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,500


909
01:04:51,500 --> 01:04:54,600
don't ever go there alone.

910
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,300


911
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:56,800
Got it?

912
01:04:56,800 --> 01:05:11,100


913
01:05:11,100 --> 01:05:12,700
Brother, that day...

914
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:12,700


915
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:17,100
Was the North really
going to attack?

916
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:17,200


917
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:18,900
How should I know?

918
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:20,400


919
01:05:20,400 --> 01:05:24,900
The Yankees were about to bomb us.
We supposed to just sit there?

920
01:05:24,900 --> 01:05:25,200


921
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,900
So don't make any
nuclear arms or missiles.

922
01:05:28,900 --> 01:05:29,300


923
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,100
Hey, do I make them?

924
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:31,900


925
01:05:31,900 --> 01:05:33,600
Why are you getting angry?

926
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:34,500


927
01:05:34,500 --> 01:05:37,200
Stop talking about war.

928
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:38,500


929
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:41,000
Everyone just write
a letter to your parents.

930
01:05:41,000 --> 01:05:42,000


931
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,700
And one to Soo Jung, too.

932
01:05:43,700 --> 01:05:45,500


933
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:48,300
If war really broke out,

934
01:05:48,300 --> 01:05:48,700


935
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:52,000
would we have to
shoot each other, too?

936
01:05:52,000 --> 01:06:06,600


937
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:10,500
How about we write each
other certificates or something?

938
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:10,800


939
01:06:10,800 --> 01:06:14,800
''We hereby certify that Nam
Sung Shik served the republic.

940
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:14,900


941
01:06:14,900 --> 01:06:18,900
Signed, Sergeant Oh Kyung Pil
and Private Jung Woo Jin.''

942
01:06:18,900 --> 01:06:19,000


943
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:20,900
Something like that.

944
01:06:20,900 --> 01:06:21,000


945
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:24,400
That's good idea!
Right!

946
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:24,800


947
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:26,800
What a waste of time.

948
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:27,800


949
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:31,000
If the Yankee bastards
play their war games,

950
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:31,800


951
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:35,200
we'll be obliterated.
Zero.

952
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:36,100


953
01:06:36,100 --> 01:06:39,600
Three minutes into the war, both
countries would be destroyed.

954
01:06:39,600 --> 01:06:40,600


955
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:44,800
A total wasteland.
Don't you get it?

956
01:06:44,800 --> 01:06:45,800


957
01:06:45,800 --> 01:06:48,000
I see.

958
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:54,000


959
01:06:54,000 --> 01:06:57,700
Man, this song reminds me of my mom.

960
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,100


961
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:01,000
Tell me,

962
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:01,100


963
01:07:01,100 --> 01:07:05,400
Why did this singer
have to die so young?

964
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,500


965
01:07:07,500 --> 01:07:09,000
Hey!

966
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,400


967
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,000
Let's have a toast...

968
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:13,100


969
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:15,900
to singer Kwang Suk.

970
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:24,700


971
01:07:24,700 --> 01:07:26,500
[exchanging address]

972
01:07:26,500 --> 01:07:41,500


973
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,000
What?

974
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:43,600


975
01:07:43,600 --> 01:07:45,800
Oh, nothing.

976
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:57,200


977
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:58,900
Hey, squeeze in.

978
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:02,900


979
01:08:02,900 --> 01:08:04,500
Perfect.

980
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:28,400


981
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:30,100
Aren't you going?

982
01:08:30,100 --> 01:08:32,100


983
01:08:32,100 --> 01:08:34,100
We have to go.

984
01:08:34,100 --> 01:08:38,000


985
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Let's go.

986
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:50,300


987
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,400
Hey dummy.

988
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:52,500


989
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:57,400
I taught you once,
and you still can't do it?

990
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,700


991
01:08:58,700 --> 01:09:02,100
No matter what ,
I can't get it to shine.

992
01:09:02,100 --> 01:09:02,800


993
01:09:02,800 --> 01:09:04,400
Let me see.

994
01:09:04,400 --> 01:09:05,200


995
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:08,500
A soldier's has to get
it right the first time.

996
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:08,600


997
01:09:08,600 --> 01:09:12,100
I can't do this for you forever.

998
01:09:12,100 --> 01:09:15,400


999
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:16,400
Oh, wait.

1000
01:09:16,400 --> 01:09:24,200


1001
01:09:24,200 --> 01:09:25,700
Happy Birthday.

1002
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:36,200


1003
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:37,700
Thank you, comrade.

1004
01:09:37,700 --> 01:09:39,500


1005
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,000
Brother!

1006
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,800


1007
01:09:42,800 --> 01:09:44,500
Oh...damn!

1008
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:48,700


1009
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:50,900
You're crying!

1010
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:51,700


1011
01:09:51,700 --> 01:09:54,100
I can't help it.

1012
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:55,600


1013
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,900
I have something
for you guys, too.

1014
01:09:59,900 --> 01:10:00,000


1015
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,100
What?

1016
01:10:01,100 --> 01:10:09,200


1017
01:10:09,200 --> 01:10:13,500
Where'd it go?

1018
01:10:13,500 --> 01:10:16,800


1019
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,300
What is it?

1020
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:27,600


1021
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:30,600
What the hell did you eat?

1022
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:30,600


1023
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:33,500
Hey, open the door. Open it!

1024
01:10:33,500 --> 01:12:11,400


1025
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:15,100
Yes.

1026
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:15,200


1027
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:18,500
Yes.

1028
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:18,500


1029
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:22,300
What?

1030
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:23,800


1031
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:27,000
Why does he want to postpone
the cross-examination?

1032
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,700


1033
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,600
Then tell this to General Pyo.

1034
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:34,800


1035
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,000
Whether Private Nam takes a leap,

1036
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:37,100


1037
01:12:37,100 --> 01:12:40,200
or Sergeant Lee falls
not shock, it's not my concern.

1038
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:40,300


1039
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,900
I don't have time to
pamper the suspects.

1040
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:42,900


1041
01:12:42,900 --> 01:12:44,200
Understand?

1042
01:12:44,200 --> 01:14:34,600


1043
01:14:34,600 --> 01:14:36,600
Here are your depositions.

1044
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:36,700


1045
01:14:36,700 --> 01:14:40,500
Read it and tell me if you
want to change anything.

1046
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:47,700


1047
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:49,500
Oh! I'm sorry.

1048
01:14:49,500 --> 01:15:00,600


1049
01:15:00,600 --> 01:15:01,600
This is correct.

1050
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,300


1051
01:15:02,300 --> 01:15:03,200
Yes.

1052
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:15,100


1053
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,300
You recognize this?
It's the crime scene.

1054
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,400


1055
01:15:20,400 --> 01:15:21,600
Lieutenant Choi Man Soo.

1056
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,300


1057
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:24,600
Sergeant. Oh Kyung Pil.

1058
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,100


1059
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,300
And Private. Jung Woo Jin.

1060
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,700


1061
01:15:29,700 --> 01:15:32,700
How many Southern
soldiers attacked the post?

1062
01:15:32,700 --> 01:15:33,500


1063
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:34,400
Only one.

1064
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:36,000


1065
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:37,000
Are you sure?

1066
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:38,900


1067
01:15:38,900 --> 01:15:40,100
I'm sure.

1068
01:15:40,100 --> 01:15:42,800


1069
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:43,500
Alright.

1070
01:15:43,500 --> 01:15:46,800


1071
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:48,600
This is Sergeant Lee Soo-Hyuk.

1072
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:59,300


1073
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,700
Do you recognize him?

1074
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:05,300


1075
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,700
A Southern puppet.

1076
01:16:06,700 --> 01:16:26,200


1077
01:16:26,200 --> 01:16:27,100
What is this?

1078
01:16:27,100 --> 01:16:27,400


1079
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,700
What's going on here?

1080
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:28,700


1081
01:16:28,700 --> 01:16:32,500
This is another soldier presumed
to have been at the scene.

1082
01:16:32,500 --> 01:16:32,800


1083
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,200
He's in a coma, so
he couldn't make it today.

1084
01:16:36,200 --> 01:16:38,500


1085
01:16:38,500 --> 01:16:40,200
Presumed?

1086
01:16:40,200 --> 01:16:40,300


1087
01:16:40,300 --> 01:16:42,500
With what evidence?

1088
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:42,600


1089
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:46,400
During his interrogation, when told
he would take a lie detector test,

1090
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:46,500


1091
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,400
Private Nam attempted
suicide on the spot.

1092
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,000


1093
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,000
We have no choice but to
consider this as a confession.

1094
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:53,100


1095
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:57,700
Therefore, I propose we start
the investigation all over again.

1096
01:16:57,700 --> 01:16:57,800


1097
01:16:57,800 --> 01:17:00,100
We didn't come here to
listen to your stories.

1098
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:00,100


1099
01:17:00,100 --> 01:17:01,700
Please, stop!

1100
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:28,700


1101
01:17:28,700 --> 01:17:30,600
You son of a bitch!

1102
01:17:30,600 --> 01:17:35,000


1103
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:39,500
You capitalist bastard!
You know how long I've waited for this?

1104
01:17:39,500 --> 01:17:39,600


1105
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,300
Damn puppet!

1106
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:41,300


1107
01:17:41,300 --> 01:17:43,800
You know how long?

1108
01:17:43,800 --> 01:17:44,000


1109
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:47,900
Take your hands off!
I'll show you the power of our republic!

1110
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:48,000


1111
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:50,500
You capitalist pig!

1112
01:17:50,500 --> 01:18:10,100


1113
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:14,100
Son of a bitch!
Traitor to the people!

1114
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:14,100


1115
01:18:14,100 --> 01:18:14,800
- Yankee puppet!
- Sergeant Oh!

1116
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,300


1117
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:19,100
Long live the Chosun Labor Party!

1118
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,300


1119
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,100
Our honored leader...

1120
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:22,200


1121
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:25,100
Long live Supreme Commander Kim Jong-Il!

1122
01:18:25,100 --> 01:24:22,300


1123
01:24:22,300 --> 01:24:25,200
I'm sorry to make you come.
I know you're still ill.

1124
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:27,600


1125
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:32,600
This states my dismissal from the
JSA case from midnight tomorrow.

1126
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:33,100


1127
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:35,600
I heard about your father.

1128
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:51,100


1129
01:24:51,100 --> 01:24:54,400
So you heard my father was
a North Korean general?

1130
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:54,500


1131
01:24:54,500 --> 01:24:57,000
How does that make you feel?

1132
01:24:57,000 --> 01:24:57,800


1133
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,300
Like a friend.

1134
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:05,600


1135
01:25:05,600 --> 01:25:08,100
I still have a bruise,

1136
01:25:08,100 --> 01:25:09,100


1137
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:11,800
but you're clean.

1138
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:14,600


1139
01:25:14,600 --> 01:25:17,600
Your grip must be stronger
than Sergeant Oh's.

1140
01:25:17,600 --> 01:25:21,000


1141
01:25:21,000 --> 01:25:25,000
Alright, the real show starts now.

1142
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:25,100


1143
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:26,400
Watch carefully.

1144
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:30,700


1145
01:25:30,700 --> 01:25:35,800
As soon as I met Soo Jung,
I knew I had seen her face before.

1146
01:25:35,800 --> 01:25:36,600


1147
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:40,900
And it wasn't hard to
fingure out who she was.

1148
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:42,200


1149
01:25:42,200 --> 01:25:46,100
This is a picture drawn
by Private Jung.

1150
01:25:46,100 --> 01:25:46,200


1151
01:25:46,200 --> 01:25:47,500
And this...

1152
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,300


1153
01:25:49,300 --> 01:25:52,300
This picture was found
on Private Jung's body.

1154
01:25:52,300 --> 01:25:53,600


1155
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:58,400
If the missing bullet
broke Private Nam's alibi,

1156
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,000


1157
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:00,600
then this missing face

1158
01:26:00,600 --> 01:26:00,700


1159
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:05,300
proves that the four soldiers
must have been friends.

1160
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:12,900


1161
01:26:12,900 --> 01:26:14,200
So?

1162
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:16,400


1163
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:19,500
These are two completely
different reports.

1164
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:19,900


1165
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:23,000
Which one I submit is up to you.

1166
01:26:23,000 --> 01:26:28,700


1167
01:26:28,700 --> 01:26:31,700
If you tell me the truth,

1168
01:26:31,700 --> 01:26:31,800


1169
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:36,200
I won't leave any of this information for
my successor.

1170
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:40,400


1171
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,700
Is that a threat?

1172
01:26:41,700 --> 01:26:43,300


1173
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:45,100
It's a deal.

1174
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:45,200


1175
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:49,800
I don't care whether
I go to jail or get a medal.

1176
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:49,900


1177
01:26:49,900 --> 01:26:52,900
So what can you offer me,

1178
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:52,900


1179
01:26:52,900 --> 01:26:55,100
if I tell you the truth?

1180
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:59,000


1181
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,500
Someone you tried
to protect till the end...

1182
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:03,000


1183
01:27:03,000 --> 01:27:04,900
Sergeant Oh's safety.

1184
01:27:04,900 --> 01:27:57,200


1185
01:27:57,200 --> 01:27:58,900
Comrade Choi, please calm down.

1186
01:27:58,900 --> 01:27:59,000


1187
01:27:59,000 --> 01:28:00,500
I'll explain everything.

1188
01:28:00,500 --> 01:28:00,600


1189
01:28:00,600 --> 01:28:04,500
What's going on here?

1190
01:28:04,500 --> 01:28:04,600


1191
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:07,400
Please, put the gun down.
You too, Soo Hyuk!

1192
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:12,200


1193
01:28:12,200 --> 01:28:14,100
You bastard!

1194
01:28:14,100 --> 01:28:14,400


1195
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:19,000
I put you on guard and you
screw around with these puppets?

1196
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:19,200


1197
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,400
Arrest them now!

1198
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:23,400


1199
01:28:23,400 --> 01:28:27,800
They came here to discuss
coming to the North.

1200
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:27,900


1201
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:29,700
I'll take care of everything.

1202
01:28:29,700 --> 01:28:29,800


1203
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:33,500
Hey, Jung Woo Jin!
This is a direct order.

1204
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:33,600


1205
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:36,100
These scumbags are our enemies.
Disarm them now.

1206
01:28:36,100 --> 01:28:37,000


1207
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:38,400
Shoot them!

1208
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:42,100


1209
01:28:42,100 --> 01:28:44,900
I'll take full responsibility.
Don't move!

1210
01:28:44,900 --> 01:28:45,100


1211
01:28:45,100 --> 01:28:46,600
Do what I say now,

1212
01:28:46,600 --> 01:28:46,700


1213
01:28:46,700 --> 01:28:49,400
and I'll overlook
this treasonable act.

1214
01:28:49,400 --> 01:28:52,600


1215
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,000
Do it now!

1216
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,000


1217
01:28:57,000 --> 01:28:58,600
Comrade Oh, I'm sorry.

1218
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:06,700


1219
01:29:06,700 --> 01:29:08,500
Soo Hyuk.

1220
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:08,500


1221
01:29:08,500 --> 01:29:10,700
Put your gun down.

1222
01:29:10,700 --> 01:29:11,500


1223
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,400
There's no other way.

1224
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:16,900


1225
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:17,600
No way.

1226
01:29:17,600 --> 01:29:19,500


1227
01:29:19,500 --> 01:29:21,600
I'll help you come to the North.

1228
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:21,700


1229
01:29:21,700 --> 01:29:25,200
You can live with us
okay?

1230
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:25,700


1231
01:29:25,700 --> 01:29:27,100
Alright?

1232
01:29:27,100 --> 01:29:29,000


1233
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:30,900
Put the gun down first
and we'll talk.

1234
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:30,900


1235
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:32,200
Fuck that!

1236
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,300


1237
01:29:33,300 --> 01:29:36,500
You know better. This
asshole can't be trusted.

1238
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:36,600


1239
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,700
You said it yourself,
that he's an ambitious prick.

1240
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:40,800


1241
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:45,600
He'll kill us both and say we
infiltrated enemy territory.

1242
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:45,700


1243
01:29:45,700 --> 01:29:47,700
I promise I'll protect you.

1244
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:47,700


1245
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:50,200
You still don't trust me?

1246
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:50,200


1247
01:29:50,200 --> 01:29:54,600
Sung Shik, you trust me.
Talk to him.

1248
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:57,100


1249
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:00,200
Could this be a trap?

1250
01:30:00,200 --> 01:30:00,300


1251
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:02,100
Soo Hyuk, brother!

1252
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:02,200


1253
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:07,100
You remember when Comrade Oh
saved you from the mine?

1254
01:30:07,100 --> 01:30:07,200


1255
01:30:07,200 --> 01:30:08,600
Don't you?

1256
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:08,600


1257
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,800
Please put the gun down, okay?

1258
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:15,500


1259
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:20,200
Fuck it!

1260
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:20,200


1261
01:30:20,200 --> 01:30:23,800
Fuck this 'brother' shit.

1262
01:30:23,800 --> 01:30:26,500


1263
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:28,600
We're enemies, after all.

1264
01:30:28,600 --> 01:30:40,000


1265
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:44,100
You said I was chicken, right?

1266
01:30:44,100 --> 01:30:44,200


1267
01:30:44,200 --> 01:30:47,700
Fine, see if I can kill
this bastard or not.

1268
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:47,800


1269
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:48,800
Just watch.

1270
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:48,800


1271
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:51,700
Hey, Soo Hyuk!

1272
01:30:51,700 --> 01:30:51,800


1273
01:30:51,800 --> 01:30:55,900
We're all going to die this way.

1274
01:30:55,900 --> 01:30:56,900


1275
01:30:56,900 --> 01:31:00,400
Let's start over.

1276
01:31:00,400 --> 01:31:03,900


1277
01:31:03,900 --> 01:31:06,100
Put your guns down together.

1278
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:06,200


1279
01:31:06,200 --> 01:31:07,700
You too, Woo Jin!

1280
01:31:07,700 --> 01:31:15,900


1281
01:31:15,900 --> 01:31:17,200
Just put them down.

1282
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:19,500


1283
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:21,000
Down.

1284
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:25,500


1285
01:31:25,500 --> 01:31:27,500
Something's not right.

1286
01:31:27,500 --> 01:34:25,900


1287
01:34:25,900 --> 01:34:27,700
Listen to me.

1288
01:34:27,700 --> 01:34:27,800


1289
01:34:27,800 --> 01:34:29,300
Say you were kidnapped
and then escaped.

1290
01:34:29,300 --> 01:34:29,400


1291
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,900
You were never here.
Got it?

1292
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:31,900


1293
01:34:31,900 --> 01:34:34,200
Now go.
There's no time!

1294
01:34:34,200 --> 01:34:35,900


1295
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:37,200
Go.

1296
01:34:37,200 --> 01:34:49,100


1297
01:34:49,100 --> 01:34:50,400
Soo Hyuk...

1298
01:34:50,400 --> 01:35:58,100


1299
01:35:58,100 --> 01:35:59,600
Who the hell's that?

1300
01:35:59,600 --> 01:35:59,700


1301
01:35:59,700 --> 01:36:02,000
He looks like one of ours!

1302
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:41,800


1303
01:36:41,800 --> 01:36:42,900
Get down!

1304
01:36:42,900 --> 01:37:37,000


1305
01:37:37,000 --> 01:37:39,000
Soo Hyuk! Soo Hyuk!

1306
01:37:39,000 --> 01:37:39,100


1307
01:37:39,100 --> 01:37:41,500
Cover us!
You bastards!

1308
01:37:41,500 --> 01:37:53,000


1309
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,900
Hurry up!

1310
01:37:54,900 --> 01:38:08,900


1311
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:10,200
Hold your fire!

1312
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:10,200


1313
01:38:10,200 --> 01:38:12,400
Cease fire!

1314
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:24,400


1315
01:38:24,400 --> 01:38:28,600
So that's how Private Jung
ended up dying on his birthday.

1316
01:38:28,600 --> 01:38:30,600


1317
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:32,800
I don't think about the dead.

1318
01:38:32,800 --> 01:38:36,800


1319
01:38:36,800 --> 01:38:41,200
Do you think you can forgive
Private Nam and Sergeant Lee?

1320
01:38:41,200 --> 01:38:49,200


1321
01:38:49,200 --> 01:38:50,700
May I have one?

1322
01:38:50,700 --> 01:39:08,400


1323
01:39:08,400 --> 01:39:12,100
If this had happened
at a Southern post,

1324
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:15,000


1325
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:17,400
I would've shot first.

1326
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:28,900


1327
01:39:28,900 --> 01:39:32,700
I heard you're being discharged.

1328
01:39:32,700 --> 01:39:35,100


1329
01:39:35,100 --> 01:39:38,100
How does it feel
to leave Panmunjom?

1330
01:39:38,100 --> 01:39:47,600


1331
01:39:47,600 --> 01:39:51,700
Sgt. Lee is being sent
to Yongsan Hospital today.

1332
01:39:51,700 --> 01:39:51,800


1333
01:39:51,800 --> 01:39:54,900
Do you have a message for him?

1334
01:39:54,900 --> 01:40:22,800


1335
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:25,000
He's made good use of it.

1336
01:40:25,000 --> 01:40:25,100


1337
01:40:25,100 --> 01:40:27,500
He said he's going
to quit smoking.

1338
01:40:27,500 --> 01:40:28,000


1339
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:30,200
You know that missing bullet?

1340
01:40:30,200 --> 01:40:30,300


1341
01:40:30,300 --> 01:40:34,400
Sgt. Oh threw it into the
reservoir with the cassette player.

1342
01:40:34,400 --> 01:40:38,900


1343
01:40:38,900 --> 01:40:43,400
I guess I've left
a stain on your career.

1344
01:40:43,400 --> 01:40:44,700


1345
01:40:44,700 --> 01:40:45,500
It doesn't matter.

1346
01:40:45,500 --> 01:40:46,600


1347
01:40:46,600 --> 01:40:48,800
I chose to fail.

1348
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:51,700


1349
01:40:51,700 --> 01:40:55,000
Oh, there was one inconsistency
in Sgt. Oh's testimony.

1350
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,100


1351
01:40:56,100 --> 01:40:58,700
He said Pvt. Nam didn't kill Pvt. Jung.

1352
01:40:58,700 --> 01:40:58,700


1353
01:40:58,700 --> 01:41:00,600
It was you.

1354
01:41:00,600 --> 01:41:02,100


1355
01:41:02,100 --> 01:41:03,500
It all happened so quickly,

1356
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:03,500


1357
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:05,400
you must have remembered it wrong.

1358
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:06,100


1359
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:08,200
Or Sergeant Oh made a mistake.

1360
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:10,000


1361
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:14,300
But what does it matter who
shot a second quicker or later?

1362
01:41:14,300 --> 01:41:31,300


1363
01:41:31,300 --> 01:41:35,100
I hope you get well soon.

1364
01:41:35,100 --> 01:44:50,900


1365
01:44:50,900 --> 01:44:52,300
Thank you.

1366
