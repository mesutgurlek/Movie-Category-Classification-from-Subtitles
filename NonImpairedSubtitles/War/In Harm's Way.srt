1
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,831
Liz Eddington, pie-eyed.

2
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,031
- Where?
- Over there.

3
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:30,038
Happy, baby?

4
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,911
I'm gonna put a stop to this.

5
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,398
- Paul Eddington can take care of her.
- No, he can't.

6
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,795
He's at sea on gunnery practice.

7
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,516
Please play something else.

8
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,110
- Thank heaven they stopped the music.
- Why did they stop?

9
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,357
- Come on, they've had their show.
- I don't wanna go.

10
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:13,471
- Come on.
- I don't want to!

11
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,752
It's a stuffy Navy joint.
Let's get outta here.

12
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,190
- We should take her home.
- Mac...

13
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,868
- One last dance.
- We can't let her...

14
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,638
She's with that officer.

15
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,912
What about her husband
out there doing his duty?

16
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,951
Eddington knows about Liz.

17
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,550
If he wants to put up with it,
that's his business.

18
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:35,149
- I love you.
- What?

19
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:40,315
- I just said, "I love you."
- Why?

20
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:42,078
Never mind.

21
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,749
If you've cooled down now,
I think we can go.

22
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,030
I'm not sure I want to go now.

23
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:59,711
You've got the duty in the morning, early.

24
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,151
- Lieutenant J G McConnel.
- Yes, ma'am?

25
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,433
You've got to play
captain of your ship at 6 a.m.

26
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,954
Liz!

27
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,798
Come on in. It's great!

28
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,357
Come on!

29
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,591
I'm awake, Leary.

30
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,191
Tell the exec to join me
in my sea cabin for breakfast.

31
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,913
Leary?

32
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,554
Oh.

33
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:23,279
- Well, then, bacon and eggs for me.
- Aye, aye, sir.

34
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,114
Eddington!

35
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,437
Paul, wake up.

36
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:58,312
In case it slipped your mind,
it's gunnery stations at 0830.

37
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,954
So why don't you write me up?

38
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:05,312
Because your record already looks like
a bunch of pig tracks.

39
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:09,672
One more scratch on it
and your career in the Navy is ended.

40
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,713
That's how it should be,
I should be scrapped.

41
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,959
I'm obsolescing like this old
straw-bottomed cruiser of ours.

42
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,436
We both know what's eating you, Paul.

43
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,279
You can't wash it out with booze.

44
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:29,429
- What would you know about it?
- I tried it one time.

45
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:33,235
You? The Rock of Ages?

46
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,795
I don't believe it.

47
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,993
You're forcing me to throw
my weight at you. Fish or cut bait.

48
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:44,751
Get on your feet or take your troubles
elsewhere. I got a ship to run.

49
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,315
I'll put in for a transfer.

50
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,275
You've had one transfer already,
out of naval aviation.

51
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,110
- Might not get another chance.
- I don't give a damn.

52
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:02,836
Well, that isn't what I wanted
to hear you say.

53
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,513
I'm sorry, Rock.

54
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,594
OK.

55
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:17,198
If you can hold a razor, you might shave
before you come topside.

56
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,675
Aye, aye, Father Torrey.

57
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:21,791
You bum!

58
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:06,278
- Cut that out.
- Take me home!

59
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,315
Come on, I need a bath.

60
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,714
Good morning, sir.

61
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,151
If the captain were aboard,
would you dress that way?

62
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,679
I suspect not, sir.

63
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,077
Put on your uniform.
You make us look like pirates.

64
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,918
Aye, aye, Mr McConnel.

65
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:06,229
All right, 15-2, 15-4...
Double run of 8 for 12, your crib.

66
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,072
- Anything interesting?
- I got a run of three.

67
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,317
- The carriers pulled out Friday.
- For where?

68
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:16,909
South. Lahaina Roads, maybe.

69
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,430
I got that Hawaiian Sea Frontier
dispatch decoded.

70
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,030
Give it to our captain,
Lieutenant J G McConnel.

71
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,552
- More fun and games?
- No.

72
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,433
Destroyer <i>Ward</i> dropped depth charges

73
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,791
on a submarine contact
inside the defensive sea area.

74
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:40,393
Some poor Joe's got it in the wringer.
Attacking one of our own subs...

75
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,718
Commence evasive zigzag pattern,
Commander.

76
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:47,753
- Set extra lookouts.
- Aye, aye, sir.

77
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,348
- Morning, Captain.
- Morning. How are you this fine day?

78
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,758
Splendid, thank you, sir.
What's the alert?

79
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:06,794
<i>Ward</i> dropped depth charges
on what they think is a sub,

80
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,195
15 miles away, near the sea buoy.

81
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,675
Another poor whale lost its blubber.

82
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,509
Sir, are we just looking for subs
or planes, too?

83
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,994
Anything, son.

84
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,829
There's a formation of planes
north of the island, sir.

85
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,918
The pilots are up early
for squadron exercises.

86
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:28,636
Strange place to rendezvous.
Why aren't they over Diamond Head?

87
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:31,798
There's a formation
off Diamond Head, too.

88
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,276
I don't like it, Paul.
Sound General Quarters.

89
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,471
- Make it no drill.
- Yes, sir.

90
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,830
This is not a drill.

91
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,352
<i>General Quarters.</i>
<i>All hands man your battle stations.</i>

92
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,160
<i>On deck.</i>
<i>Attention to colours.</i>

93
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,073
Bridge. Aye, aye.

94
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,513
Mr McConnel?

95
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,199
- McConnel.
- We're getting some funny signals.

96
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:51,029
It sounds like plane-to-plane chatter,
in Japanese.

97
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,391
- Japs!
- What?

98
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,714
Japs!

99
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,238
My God, they're Japs! Come on!

100
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,072
Emergency sortie signal
from the yard tower.

101
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:54,830
Engine room? Light off all four boilers.
Make preparations for getting underway.

102
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:59,511
- Report readiness status in five minutes.
- Cut in all burners.

103
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:04,912
Disengage checking gear.
Open guarding valves.

104
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,838
Flip the electric rolls.

105
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,235
<i>General Quarters!</i>

106
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,590
<i>Man your battle stations!</i>

107
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,514
- Quoddy.
- Aye, sir.

108
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,235
- Can you take us out?
- You call it, Mr McConnel.

109
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,113
- Wait for the captain.
- Screw the captain.

110
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:42,713
- Ring up turns for 20 knots.
- Aye, aye, sir.

111
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,117
- 20 knots through the harbour?
- You heard.

112
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:01,035
Take her away. She's got enough
to move now, building fast.

113
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,950
Quoddy, right 10 degrees rudder.
Steady up on 1-2-0.

114
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,715
- It's Captain Harding, sir, and the exec.
- Slow down!

115
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:12,639
How can we stop?
It'll take 20 minutes at this speed.

116
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:15,434
Does anybody here
see anything back there?

117
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,677
Let us board! Stop!

118
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:24,034
If they does, I'll guarantee
they'll never see nothin' again!

119
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,718
Let her rip, Mac!

120
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:22,029
Advise me of any further messages.

121
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:25,516
How many ships answered
the emergency sortie signal?

122
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,790
Destroyer <i>Cassiday</i>'s moving, sir.

123
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,834
The <i>Harkness</i>, <i>Ballard</i>,
cruisers <i>Greely</i> and <i>Jackson</i>...

124
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,553
The battleships, man!

125
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:36,033
None, sir.

126
00:17:38,040 --> 00:17:41,430
- Out of nine battleships?
- None, sir.

127
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:48,836
Lookout reports tin-can breaking out, sir.

128
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:54,114
Paul, signal all ships coming out
to form up with us.

129
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,594
Aye, aye, sir.

130
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:08,598
- That can't be all.
- That's all Captain Torrey reports, sir.

131
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:13,112
Three light cruisers, eight destroyers
and Captain Torrey's heavy cruiser.

132
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,154
- None is equipped with radar.
- 12 bat-blind ships.

133
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,999
Well, gentlemen. Your opinions.

134
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,192
We must position them
to repel an invasion.

135
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,349
- You mean wait, Admiral Broderick.
- We have no choice. Wait.

136
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:31,154
Seek out and destroy, if at all possible.

137
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:35,069
What can 12 ships do
against the Jap task force?

138
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,874
It would be a futile gesture.

139
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:43,029
It could give us time
to bring our carriers within range.

140
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:47,552
What if Torrey can't contact the Japs?
Suppose they slip by him?

141
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,320
He has no radar, one scout plane.

142
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,149
The risk is too great,
leaving our shores unprotected.

143
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:58,638
- I repeat, sir. We must wait.
- Thank you, Admiral Broderick.

144
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,389
Order Captain Torrey to assume
command of his task group

145
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:05,592
and seek out and engage
the enemy if possible.

146
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:16,316
- All your personal problems resolved?
- Let's say they're cut down a size.

147
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,318
Dispatch has come in
from Fleet Operations, sir.

148
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,915
- Burke?
- From CinCPac.

149
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:37,271
"Japanese believed retiring for refuelling.

150
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,234
"Proceed to latitude 18 north,
longitude 162 west.

151
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,193
"Seek out and engage the enemy.
Godspeed."

152
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,597
- Well!
- Well!

153
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,394
Have all ships report
useable fuel aboard.

154
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:55,674
Break radio silence. Ask CinCPac
for a tanker rendezvous at first light.

155
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:00,192
- After you figure our projected position.
- Aye, aye, sir.

156
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,832
We'll play hell
getting a tanker out of Pearl.

157
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:09,989
If we don't, we'll be sucking air
instead of oil by midnight tomorrow.

158
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:18,470
Sir, the starboard lookout
has a ship on the bow.

159
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,432
A tanker, he thinks, sir.

160
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:30,077
She's riding high. She's empty.

161
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,511
She's going home,
if a sub doesn't get her.

162
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:37,235
At this rate, we'll have to head home
inside 10 hours.

163
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:39,635
We could reduce speed to save fuel.

164
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:43,719
Crawl at 10 knots?
We'd never find any Japs.

165
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:49,677
- If we stopped zigzagging...
- That'd be an invitation to enemy subs.

166
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,553
There may be subs out there, maybe not.

167
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:56,435
Whether there are
or aren't subs out there,

168
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:02,715
if we steer a straight course, we'd add
another six hours to our steaming time.

169
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,475
Resume our base course.

170
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,195
- Straighten us out, Commander Burke.
- Aye, aye, sir.

171
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,080
Rock, you just threw the book away.

172
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,430
How long will Torrey keep pushing?

173
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,313
We haven't enough fuel
to hold the keel down.

174
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:42,195
He'll run the rope out
and then add some string to it.

175
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:47,190
- Where'd you know him?
- He instructed at the Academy.

176
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,233
We call him the Rock.
Scared the hell outta you.

177
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:53,034
He's all Navy and nothin' but Navy.

178
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,631
He never left the campus,
like he had nowhere else to go.

179
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:02,152
Sonar contact, sir, bearing 0-2-0.
Range 2,000 and closing.

180
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,439
Make turns for 20 knots.
Set condition able.

181
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,915
Close all watertight doors.

182
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:19,079
- Tell Sonar to keep the ranges coming.
- 1800 and closing.

183
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,238
- Cline? You on the recorder?
- <i>You know it</i>!

184
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:25,796
Signal flagship we're about to attack
sonar contact.

185
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:42,040
<i>Cassiday</i> reports submarine contact.

186
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,518
- Have all ships resume zigzag.
- Aye, aye, sir.

187
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:50,269
- 0-1-5 it is, sir.
- Stand by to roll depth charges.

188
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,870
Stern racks. Roll one.

189
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,156
Roll two.

190
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,678
They're on it, sir.

191
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,678
They hit the cruiser!

192
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:38,879
- Reports from damage control.
- She's dead in the water.

193
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,153
- Midship damage control won't answer.
- Shall I go below, sir?

194
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,956
- Tell me when you locate the damage.
- That arm's busted.

195
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,990
- What's wrong?
- The door's jammed.

196
00:23:55,200 --> 00:24:00,035
Get a message to Pearl: "Have taken
two torpedoes" - fill in our position -

197
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:04,233
- "Will advise on damage."
- And break radio silence, sir?

198
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:08,513
Burke, don't you think the Japanese
know by now where we are?

199
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,994
Aye, aye, sir.

200
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:14,752
The door may blow. Stand clear!

201
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,117
Griggs, get those mattresses down.

202
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,273
Stand by to fire another full pattern.

203
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,635
Order the destroyers back to Pearl
at best possible speed, zigzagging.

204
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:23,628
- <i>Cassiday</i> got the sub, sir. Definite kill.
- Hold it!

205
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:28,868
Have all ships return to Pearl
at 20 knots, except the <i>Cassiday</i>.

206
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:33,756
Have her stand by
in case we have to abandon ship.

207
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,314
OK...

208
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,069
- Compliments of Cdr. Eddington.
- Just give me the word.

209
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:04,397
Cdr. Eddington says
this old tub'll float, sir.

210
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,477
- At ease.
- Thank you, sir.

211
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:07,954
Full report.

212
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:12,873
We halted the fires up forward
where we took the first torpedo.

213
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:15,958
And we stopped the flow
of water at Hatch 26.

214
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:21,314
Cdr. Eddington said to tell the old man -
I'm sorry, sir, the captain -

215
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,479
that he'd better start
thinking about a tow.

216
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:29,434
May I also say, sir,
that Cdr. Eddington is hell on wheels.

217
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:35,232
- What are the casualties?
- At least 40 men were trapped.

218
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,991
- 40 men, maybe more.
- <i>Cassiday</i> coming alongside, sir.

219
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,112
Take care of this boy.

220
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:56,908
Nice work, Harding.
You did a four-o job on that sub.

221
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:00,957
Thank you, sir.
I'm not Commander Harding.

222
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:04,391
- Where is he?
- Ashore, sir.

223
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:10,837
- Who's in command?
- I am, sir. Lieutenant J G McConnel.

224
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,109
Did I hear "Lieutenant Junior Grade"?

225
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:18,278
William McConnel, class of '38.

226
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:26,478
- Can you rig for towing?
- Can do, sir.

227
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,708
Can you pass some
portable pumps to us?

228
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,717
Can do, sir.

229
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,070
Carry on, mister.

230
00:27:38,040 --> 00:27:39,917
Can do.

231
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:46,355
Oh, Rock of Ages.
We got ourselves another war.

232
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,598
A gut-bustin', mother-Iovin' Navy war.

233
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,713
It does seem to shape up that way,
Commander Eddington.

234
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,557
Captain Torrey,
the admiral will see you now.

235
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,474
Thank you.

236
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,510
- Please sit down, Captain.
- Thank you, sir.

237
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,359
I wasn't aware you'd been hurt.

238
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:27,279
A simple fracture, sir.
It won't interfere with my duties.

239
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,790
You have a remarkable record,
Captain Torrey.

240
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:33,309
- Thank you, sir.
- Save your thanks.

241
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,957
I'm relieving you of your command
pending a court of inquiry.

242
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:39,991
I don't understand.

243
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,272
You weren't zigzagging
when you took the torpedo.

244
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,596
I was stretching my fuel, sir.

245
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,509
If you didn't have enough fuel,
why didn't you turn back?

246
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:55,078
My mission was to engage an enemy
of greatly superior strength.

247
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:58,989
I could only take that one way:
My group was expendable.

248
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,510
I doubt a court of inquiry
will accept that.

249
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:07,316
You're caught in the vacuum between
a peacetime Navy and a wartime Navy.

250
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,149
Soon they'll make admirals
out of captains with guts.

251
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,673
Now, they're reacting to Pearl Harbor
and punishment is order of the day.

252
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,476
You don't have to abide by
what a court of inquiry decides.

253
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:27,357
You can ask for a general court martial,
get a couple of lawyers and fight it.

254
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,835
I wouldn't care to do that, sir.

255
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:35,153
- Why not?
- Second-generation Navy, Admiral.

256
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,271
I see.

257
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:44,519
I don't plan to ask for a court martial
either, and I've lost a fleet.

258
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:49,589
I expect we'll both take what they give us
and trust it'll be a useful job.

259
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,074
Yes, sir.

260
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:54,158
- Good luck.
- Good luck to you, sir.

261
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:58,838
If I haven't got him, maybe he's still alive.

262
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:01,838
It must be a mistake,
he was clever...

263
00:30:02,040 --> 00:30:03,917
Comb, compact...

264
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,398
- The child can't be lost...
- Two rings... purse.

265
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:12,149
- Maybe the police know where he is.
- Sign here.

266
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,557
He was my only boy,
and I love him so much.

267
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,788
- Won't you do something for me?
- This way for identification.

268
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:25,278
- Go back to the police.
- I want you to help me.

269
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:28,153
- Lady...
- He was my only boy.

270
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:29,998
You don't have a boy!

271
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,592
Disposition?

272
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,356
What do you want to do?

273
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,074
- I'll send someone.
- Thank you.

274
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:22,195
And the man she was brought in with?

275
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:25,949
Army Air Force claimed the body
a couple of days ago.

276
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,834
...a very pretty name.

277
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,988
- Been here long?
- I'm from Hawaii.

278
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,156
- I like Hawaii.
- Me, too.

279
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,318
- Where's my drink?
- I made you a fresh one.

280
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:03,919
- Thanks.
- Bourbon.

281
00:32:04,120 --> 00:32:08,318
- Sorry, nothin' but beer. Martial law.
- OK, beer.

282
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:12,957
- How come the Air Corps rates a drink?
- They brought that bottle in.

283
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:17,233
Running dry, Commander?
Let me sweeten your beer.

284
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,398
Share and share alike,
we're all in this war.

285
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:23,717
Little more? OK... How's that?

286
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:30,396
Would you like to join us?
Only two chicks but we can share...

287
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:35,640
Send the police to the Blue Lagoon.

288
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,552
Come.

289
00:32:56,760 --> 00:33:01,072
Sir, I just got word
on Commander Eddington.

290
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:04,272
- What about him?
- He's in the Honolulu brig.

291
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:07,552
- In the brig?
- That's the word, sir.

292
00:33:09,640 --> 00:33:12,074
Will you see my clothes are packed

293
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:15,590
and sent over to
the bachelors officers' quarters?

294
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,076
Yes, sir. Can I help you with that?

295
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,674
- Is that all, sir?
- I travel light.

296
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,075
Well, Commander Burke...

297
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:33,994
Oh, sir...

298
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:41,873
- Goodbye, sir.
- Goodbye.

299
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:43,236
You're released into
your captain's custody, sir.

300
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,353
Sergeant.

301
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,718
This is yours, sir.

302
00:34:59,880 --> 00:35:05,034
I'll walk you to the Duty Boat.
I've been relieved of command.

303
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,999
Bastards!

304
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,592
Sorry about your wife.

305
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,674
You got yourself into a pretty good fix.
A public brawl...

306
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,871
What the hell.

307
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:27,158
A new AA cruiser
going out to join Halsey.

308
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,239
She's a tiger.

309
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:36,477
A fast ship going in harm's way.

310
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:41,591
A lousy situation,
Commander Eddington.

311
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,033
Lousy.

312
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,913
Stay still.

313
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,190
Good. Come with me, please, Captain.

314
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:24,109
Shoot those over to Dr Lyons
as soon as they're ready.

315
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,515
- Doctor?
- Yes.

316
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:50,635
A 3-month-old fracture, some infection.
The X-rays will be along shortly.

317
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,796
Thank you. Sit down, Captain.

318
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,833
That's a real nice sound to wake up to.

319
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:48,118
- What is Vicki Marlowe's secret?
- Not what it says in here.

320
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:52,711
Her secret is that she's making
half a million bucks a year

321
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:57,869
and she still collects alimony from me,
in my present reduced circumstances.

322
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:59,479
Well, anyway...

323
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:04,758
I have the satisfaction that
all her pictures have been stinkers

324
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,916
since I stopped writing them.

325
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:13,551
Rockwell, my boy, I tell you never,
I repeat, never marry a movie actress.

326
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:17,196
- You married three of 'em.
- It's like eating peanuts.

327
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,790
Once I started, I couldn't stop!

328
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:24,959
Hey, look at you!
Two hands, congratulations.

329
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,594
- Shall we celebrate?
- How?

330
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,519
There's some action
at a place in Moanalua.

331
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,836
No, no parties for me.

332
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:39,593
Anyway, when do you special intelligence
officers do what you're supposed to do?

333
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:43,713
Seems you sleep all day
and go to parties every night.

334
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:48,232
Us civilians need more rest
and recreation than you old salts.

335
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,715
Not that you couldn't use a little.

336
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:56,074
It's time you crawled down from
Mount Rushmore and looked around.

337
00:38:56,280 --> 00:39:00,717
You'd be surprised at the changes
we've made in the last 100 years.

338
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,959
I tell you, the women are
smoking cigarettes, drinking whiský,

339
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,118
doing the shimmy-sham-shimmy
hot damn, man...

340
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,880
- Very funny.
- Come on, Rock...

341
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,638
No, no thanks.

342
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,150
- OK.
- What?

343
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:21,191
Maybe you're right.

344
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:26,997
I gotta do something besides sit at a desk
and count the ink stains on the blotter.

345
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:40,279
Who's our host?

346
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:44,109
Whoever knows the host?
Some pineapple moneybags.

347
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:45,753
Were you invited?

348
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:49,748
One sailor looks like another.
Gimme your hat.

349
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,998
Egan Powell!

350
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,951
I want you to meet Captain Torrey.
This is Mrs...

351
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:07,799
...Let me see...
- Henderson.

352
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,479
How do you do?

353
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:12,918
Follow me.

354
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:15,634
Hello, Paula.

355
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,434
Well... Thank you very much.

356
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,632
Let's go over here.

357
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,389
It's very important to relax, old boy.

358
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:32,395
- Paul, how are you?
- Hello, Egan.

359
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,273
- Introduce me.
- Gaby, this is Egan.

360
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,755
- How do you do?
- You don't mind?

361
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,439
Hold that, will you?

362
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:07,114
- Enjoying the party, Captain Torrey?
- Yes, thank you. Fine party.

363
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,629
- You think so?
- It's great.

364
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,753
Thank you.

365
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:27,230
- Funny.
- What's funny?

366
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:32,036
Not exactly funny, it's just that
you're so different from your son.

367
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,754
- My son?
- Ensign Jere Torrey.

368
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:39,192
At least he claims his father's a captain.
I supposed you were it.

369
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:42,920
That's my son's name. Jeremiah. Jere.

370
00:41:43,120 --> 00:41:47,750
He's been dating my room-mate.
Frankly, it worries me a little.

371
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:52,158
She's a green kid from Vermont,
he's a smooth Harvard type.

372
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:56,990
I think she's about to fall in love with him.
That's what worries me.

373
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,670
- Will it be all right?
- I hope so.

374
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,077
Not much comfort.

375
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,272
- How's the arm?
- I beg your pardon?

376
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:12,155
- Your arm!
- Oh, it's... fine.

377
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,476
I'm Nurse Lt. Haynes.
I took the X-rays today.

378
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:19,752
- I'm sorry!
- Thank you for not recognising me.

379
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:23,475
I made a special effort
to not look like a nurse.

380
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:28,433
Don't worry about your son.
I'm sure he's all he should be.

381
00:42:29,640 --> 00:42:34,839
I'm flying under false colours,
Miss Haynes. I don't know my son.

382
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:37,076
I've been divorced many years.

383
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,999
He was raised
by his mother and her family.

384
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:42,714
I didn't even know he was in the Navy.

385
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,513
Well...!

386
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,995
Much as I'd like to,
I won't ask any more questions.

387
00:42:53,360 --> 00:42:56,591
I hate to leave but
I have to get to the hospital.

388
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,997
I don't have to get any place but out.
Share a cab?

389
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:04,318
Let me drop you. I borrowed a car
from my landlord's gardener.

390
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,036
Thank you, Miss Haynes.

391
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,550
I'm Maggie...
if you'd like to be less formal.

392
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,876
Thank you for that, too.

393
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:31,552
But don't wait too long.
My unit's due to be shipped out soon.

394
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,549
- Captain.
- Maggie.

395
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,234
- Ensign Torrey?
- No, sir.

396
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:12,309
Your duty office said Ensign Torrey
had the watch aboard this craft.

397
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,238
- Yes, sir.
- Well?

398
00:44:14,440 --> 00:44:17,034
- I'll get him for you, sir.
- Thank you.

399
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:23,194
Get topside, quick. Brass!

400
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,868
- Did you hear me?
- I'm going.

401
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,551
- I shouldn't have stood your watch!
- Take it easy.

402
00:44:41,280 --> 00:44:43,748
I'm Ensign Torrey, sir.

403
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:45,916
You wanted to see me?

404
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:50,959
- I'm your father, Jere.
- Yes, sir.

405
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:58,474
- You look like your mother.
- Yes, sir.

406
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:03,598
- Is she well?
- Very well, sir.

407
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:08,518
Sit down.

408
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:11,033
Thank you, sir.

409
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,151
Do you often stand your watch
in your cabin?

410
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:20,909
Ensign Farris relieved me
for a few minutes, sir.

411
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,558
Motor Torpedo Boat duty.
How do you like it?

412
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,637
I don't like it, sir.

413
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,957
Why did you choose it?
It's a voluntary duty.

414
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:40,157
I volunteered on advice. This unit's
assigned to Admiral Broderick.

415
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:45,070
I was advised that a transfer
could be arranged to the admiral's staff.

416
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,990
Who gave you the advice?

417
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:53,148
Cdr. Neal Owynn,
the admiral's public relations officer.

418
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:58,036
I'll be his assistant.
I expect you've heard of Neal Owynn.

419
00:45:58,640 --> 00:45:59,914
No.

420
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,317
He's quite a well-known
Congressman, sir.

421
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,592
He resigned from office
to join the service.

422
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,713
Your mother's family
can usually get what they want.

423
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:16,112
- You disapprove, sir?
- You trained on these boats.

424
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:20,677
You'd be a damn sight more useful here
than in public relations.

425
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:23,838
I majored in journalism at the university.

426
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,759
If I must do my bit
in this trumped-up war,

427
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:29,155
I prefer to do what I'm suited for.

428
00:46:29,360 --> 00:46:32,477
Did I hear you say "trumped-up war"?

429
00:46:32,680 --> 00:46:35,433
It is Mr Roosevelt's war, isn't it?

430
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:40,915
You not only look like a Cunliffe,
you talk like one.

431
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,908
I remember they said the first one
was Mr Wilson's war.

432
00:46:46,320 --> 00:46:51,030
- What's your duty, sir?
- Routing convoys.

433
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:57,110
I expect to be in the forward areas,
if not actually in combat.

434
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,871
Admiral Broderick is to handle
a very important offensive, Skýhook.

435
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:04,071
I wouldn't know about that.

436
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:09,115
I wouldn't expect you would.
Cdr. Owynn gave me the information.

437
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,920
Are you leaving, sir?

438
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:20,148
Yes. Before I pick you up
and throw you to the fish.

439
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:27,873
I was four when you left my mother.
I don't even remember you.

440
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:31,868
And for 18 years
you haven't bothered to remember me.

441
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,957
Why come here tonight?

442
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:42,075
Let's just say that I did come
and let it go at that.

443
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,752
Goodnight, Ensign.

444
00:48:17,480 --> 00:48:19,596
- How!
- Egan!

445
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:23,634
Where've you been for the last 10 days?
Or should I ask?

446
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,515
You shouldn't,
but there was snow in Washington.

447
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,518
Washington! Got the war all worked out?

448
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,793
If you buy me lunch,
I'll give you the date of victory.

449
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,911
- I am your man.
- Good.

450
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:43,314
- Run these courses off on the big chart.
- Aye, aye, sir.

451
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:51,631
We ensure information
given to the press corps

452
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,718
is good for the war effort
and for the Navy.

453
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:56,319
And for Broderick.

454
00:48:56,520 --> 00:49:00,229
What's good for him
is good for the Navy.

455
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:03,159
With a little left over for Neal Owynn?

456
00:49:05,040 --> 00:49:08,032
- How's the nurse?
- I'm seeing her tonight.

457
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:12,597
Why don't you come along?
She's got a room-mate that's not bad.

458
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:18,868
What do you know about
an operation called Skýhook?

459
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:22,390
- Where did you get that?
- Is it important?

460
00:49:24,320 --> 00:49:28,836
Only 20 people between here
and the White House know that name.

461
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:32,112
There's 21 now, or maybe 22 or 23.

462
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:36,757
I got it indirectly through
an ex-Congressman named Owynn.

463
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,953
That's Broderick's drumbeater.
He needs a zipper in his face.

464
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,311
That's top secret.
I can't tell you about it.

465
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,999
OK!

466
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:49,875
You say you got it indirectly,
from Owynn?

467
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:53,629
See that young ensign,
lighting his cigarette?

468
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:56,718
- That's Owynn he's sitting with.
- That's where I got it.

469
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,151
From that ensign?

470
00:50:00,360 --> 00:50:01,839
He's my son.

471
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:06,197
Well...! I'd like to meet him, Rock.

472
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:08,436
No, you wouldn't.

473
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:14,230
He had his chances to ask me.
Ten days' worth of chances is enough.

474
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:19,798
- He didn't call me. So I called him.
- How did you have the nerve?

475
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:24,198
Annalee, past a certain age,
men avoid making sudden moves

476
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:26,197
where women are concerned.

477
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,393
The women have to move
before it's too late.

478
00:50:30,600 --> 00:50:33,034
It gets late fast in these times.

479
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:37,597
I like this man,
I want him to know it. Now.

480
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:41,395
Suppose they meet?
Jere's very funny about his father.

481
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,637
Oh, let them. It might be interesting.

482
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:47,308
- This must be Jere.
- I'll go.

483
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:57,833
- Hello, Ensign.
- Yes, ma'am, Lieutenant.

484
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:02,397
- Be a minute or two... She'll be down.
- Thank you, ma'am.

485
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:03,874
Lieutenant, ma'am...

486
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:09,598
I'd like to invite you to come with us.
Dinner with Commander Neal Owynn.

487
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:12,712
Thanks, but I'm waiting for a friend.

488
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:17,038
You're more than welcome
to bring her, or him, along.

489
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:21,153
Well, if my friend
arrives in time, we'll see.

490
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:51,914
I'm here to see a nurse.
What are you here for?

491
00:51:52,120 --> 00:51:54,076
To see a nurse.

492
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,750
Seems like we have
something in common after all.

493
00:51:57,960 --> 00:52:00,952
I'm just a chip off the old block, sir.

494
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,517
- Hello.
- Miss Haynes.

495
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,234
Captain Torrey.
Ensign Annalee Dorne.

496
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:11,591
- Miss Dorne.
- You've met my friend.

497
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:18,151
Sir, I've invited Miss Haynes and friend
to dine with Cdr. Owynn.

498
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:22,239
- I hope you'll accept.
- That's very gracious of you.

499
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:25,591
But we have other plans.
Right, Lieutenant?

500
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:27,074
Yes, sir.

501
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:29,748
- In that case...
- Good afternoon.

502
00:52:29,960 --> 00:52:31,234
Miss Dorne.

503
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:45,113
- You run a taut ship.
- He's not a bad-Iooking kid, is he?

504
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:48,636
No, he isn't.

505
00:52:49,400 --> 00:52:52,073
Oh... I brought you something.

506
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:54,669
- What is it?
- Candy.

507
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,519
Candy...! Thank you.

508
00:52:57,720 --> 00:52:59,995
- Shall we eat at the Chinaman's?
- No.

509
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,873
We're going to eat here,
if you don't mind.

510
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:05,150
- I wouldn't want to...
- Please!

511
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:08,670
I haven't cooked for a man
in a long time.

512
00:53:10,920 --> 00:53:12,512
Pour us a drink.

513
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,359
If I can get this oven hot enough,
we're gonna have biscuits.

514
00:53:18,560 --> 00:53:22,872
- Want water in yours?
- Yes, but don't drown the whiský.

515
00:53:23,080 --> 00:53:24,513
I'm not a lady.

516
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,111
I started life as an army brat
and never tried to change.

517
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:30,878
Here's how.

518
00:53:32,240 --> 00:53:36,119
- Did you say Army?
- My father was a one-star general.

519
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:41,599
Daddy... He was an angel
and a devil and I was nuts about him.

520
00:53:41,800 --> 00:53:44,792
So nuts, in fact, that I married his aide.

521
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,389
Would you open this can for me?

522
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:49,477
You married his aide?

523
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,315
- He wasn't much of a man.
- This cutter's broken.

524
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,353
Not very smart or very brave.

525
00:53:57,560 --> 00:54:00,597
Maybe I expected him to be Daddy
and he wasn't.

526
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,792
That's quite a knife you carry.

527
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:09,518
Can opener, screwdriver, punch,
straight blade, even a skinning blade.

528
00:54:09,720 --> 00:54:12,393
That is useful. What do you skin?

529
00:54:12,600 --> 00:54:15,956
Lieutenant nurses who pull my leg.

530
00:54:16,160 --> 00:54:18,276
- Where was I?
- Just married.

531
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:24,237
Yes. I left him, right here in Honolulu,
shacked up with a wahine from Kauai.

532
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:28,399
That was eight years ago.
He quit the service and married her.

533
00:54:28,600 --> 00:54:33,549
I drifted till I had to latch onto something
or go down the drain.

534
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:36,797
I went to nursing school
and joined the Navy.

535
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,117
- Now I'd like to know more about you.
- Navy.

536
00:54:40,320 --> 00:54:45,235
My father was a chief petty officer
and I went to the Academy.

537
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:49,752
- That the best you can do?
- Unless you want my service record.

538
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,914
There's your son...

539
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:55,599
<i>Aloha</i>.

540
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,553
- Hi!
- Hello, Jere. Just the two of you?

541
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:17,150
- Miss Haynes couldn't come.
- I'm sure it's my loss.

542
00:55:17,360 --> 00:55:21,194
- Cdr. Owynn, meet Ensign Dorne.
- What a beautiful place.

543
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,790
I'm afraid my friend
didn't leave much liquor

544
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,958
when he decided to
sit the war out on the mainland.

545
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:31,197
I can give you a choice of... Pernod...

546
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:36,472
...and gin... Oh, yes,
there is a little brandy.

547
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,591
- Brandy for me.
- Miss Dorne?

548
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:42,031
I don't know...
Gin, I guess, but not much.

549
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:45,755
Gin, but not much.

550
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:48,235
My unit got orders today.

551
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,911
We're being assigned to ComSoPacSub
Area 3, whatever that is.

552
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:56,078
Commander Third Sub Area,
South West Pacific.

553
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,430
Sounds very impressive.

554
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:02,315
- Have you been alerted?
- No, just assigned.

555
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:05,114
Third Area is
Admiral Broderick's command.

556
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,629
- Jere's Admiral?
- The same.

557
00:56:07,840 --> 00:56:10,559
Can't get away from the Torreys, can I?

558
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:12,273
We can sit down.

559
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:25,998
- Hey!
- We're alone.

560
00:57:26,200 --> 00:57:28,760
- Where's Commander Owynn?
- It's OK.

561
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:37,793
Dinner is ready.

562
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:47,556
- Aren't we waiting for Cdr. Owynn?
- He was called to Headquarters.

563
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:50,593
I guess it's just the two of us.

564
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:55,920
- Ever hear the name Cunliffe?
- An expensive New England name.

565
00:57:56,120 --> 00:57:59,351
She was a Cunliffe, Jere's mother.

566
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:03,030
I met her at a Navy ball, 1917.

567
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,755
She was beautiful.
I don't know why she married me.

568
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:11,238
- I was just an ensign.
- I bet you were something as an ensign!

569
00:58:11,440 --> 00:58:14,796
I fell over my feet most of the time.

570
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:18,197
When I came back from the war,
I had a son.

571
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:21,153
And the Cunliffes
had great plans for me.

572
00:58:21,360 --> 00:58:24,113
I was to resign
my commission in the Navy

573
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,517
and do something useful,
the stock market.

574
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:32,919
They sat with teacups on their laps
and ticker tape coming out of their ears

575
00:58:33,120 --> 00:58:35,554
and I said "No".

576
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,830
It was quite a scene.

577
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:43,875
Then Athalie -
that was her name, Athalie -

578
00:58:44,080 --> 00:58:47,629
said, "Rockwell,
I will not become a camp follower.

579
00:58:47,840 --> 00:58:53,312
"Whenever you're not busy boating
with the Navy, feel free to visit us."

580
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,637
And that's the way it was. I visited.

581
00:58:56,840 --> 00:59:00,913
I was assigned to duty in the Philippines
and that ended it.

582
00:59:02,160 --> 00:59:06,472
You left out one small detail.
You were terribly in love with her.

583
00:59:10,040 --> 00:59:12,554
You're a good cook, Maggie.

584
00:59:13,600 --> 00:59:16,797
And you look lovely in the candlelight.

585
00:59:20,320 --> 00:59:23,630
- You haven't had much to say.
- I guess I haven't.

586
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:28,596
- Would you like to dance?
- I don't think so.

587
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,517
Come sit over here.

588
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,434
- Please don't.
- What's the matter?

589
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:45,996
We'd better go home.
I don't like this, any of it.

590
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:50,159
- Since when?
- Since your commander disappeared.

591
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:53,591
I didn't know you missed him so much.
I'm jealous!

592
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:56,837
You know what I mean.
It makes me feel cheap.

593
00:59:57,040 --> 01:00:00,032
Take it easy!
He won't be back for a long time.

594
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,470
I'm sorry, Jere, but I want to go.

595
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:04,591
- Think I'm an idiot?
- What?

596
01:00:04,800 --> 01:00:07,439
- Nothing's cheaper than a teaser.
- What?

597
01:00:07,640 --> 01:00:11,030
- Isn't that what you've been doing?
- I have not!

598
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,710
I thought we... I thought you...

599
01:00:14,920 --> 01:00:16,911
- Wait a minute!
- Let me go!

600
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:26,357
I've spent my life learning about men
and ships and how to use them in action.

601
01:00:26,560 --> 01:00:30,109
I just don't fit behind a desk, I...

602
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:34,871
...I'm not cut out for it,
I feel dry-docked.

603
01:00:35,080 --> 01:00:38,072
- Oh, well.
- Thanks.

604
01:00:38,280 --> 01:00:39,554
Thanks?

605
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:44,356
Who else have you said
these things to recently? Or ever?

606
01:00:45,520 --> 01:00:49,513
- That'll be Annalee and your son.
- Oh, I'd better...

607
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,635
- Thanks, fellas.
- You're welcome.

608
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:09,076
I think that had to happen.

609
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,312
Goodnight, Rock.

610
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,353
Goodnight, Maggie.

611
01:01:22,480 --> 01:01:26,871
- Any time, Rock. Any time at all.
- Thank you, Maggie.

612
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,236
Yeah, go ahead and I'll be there.

613
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:39,069
- Sir, Cdr. Powell is waiting for you.
- Thanks.

614
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:46,358
- Greetings!
- What are you so happy about?

615
01:01:46,560 --> 01:01:50,348
This... Want to close that door?

616
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:55,315
I have a very private little job for you,
no one but you.

617
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:59,718
Three convoys to be routed
to this island, Toulebonne.

618
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,710
- Paul Eddington is stationed there.
- It's Broderick's new base.

619
01:02:04,920 --> 01:02:06,751
Skýhook again, huh?

620
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:10,310
Here's the shipping list.

621
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:14,920
- A lot of tonnage.
- Hard to come by.

622
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:18,396
CinCPac wants it all to arrive
on time and intact.

623
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:22,149
The first convoy is loaded,
personnel go on board Thursday,

624
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:24,590
when they shove off is up to you.

625
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,597
I think I see it.

626
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:28,074
See what?

627
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,679
Skýhook.

628
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:34,353
All right.

629
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:44,077
Jap supply lines must be spread out
pretty thin south of Cape Titan.

630
01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:48,353
So Broderick could hit
Lalatea, Muk or Gavabutu.

631
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:52,599
From any of those islands,
he could launch a strike against...

632
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,917
...Levu-Vana.
- Why Levu-Vana?

633
01:02:56,120 --> 01:03:00,432
It has a central plain
large enough for B-17 airstrips.

634
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:06,237
Get B-17 s in there and we can control
1,000 miles in any direction.

635
01:03:22,920 --> 01:03:24,239
Goodnight.

636
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:34,115
- Maggie!
- Hello, sailor!

637
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:35,992
Pleasant surprise.

638
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:43,315
You're not easy to talk to on the phone,
so I decided to ambush you.

639
01:03:48,680 --> 01:03:49,999
Come in.

640
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,794
- This is nice.
- Sit down.

641
01:04:05,040 --> 01:04:09,192
- Can I offer you a drink?
- No, nothing. Thanks.

642
01:04:12,440 --> 01:04:16,399
My unit is to report to Ford Island
in the morning at six.

643
01:04:16,600 --> 01:04:20,354
We weren't told any more
but it can only mean one thing.

644
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:24,668
You'll be at sea by noon.

645
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:31,035
- Did you know I was going?
- I knew there was a convoy pulling out.

646
01:04:35,440 --> 01:04:37,510
Any hint about our destination?

647
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:43,112
You know I can't say.
You'll be told after you sail.

648
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:47,836
- Is it a long way?
- Long way.

649
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:53,319
Then we won't meet again
in the foreseeable future, right?

650
01:04:54,920 --> 01:04:56,512
Right.

651
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:02,950
Do you think we'd better let it go at that?

652
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:19,076
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Commander Powell.

653
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:20,759
Just a moment.

654
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,073
For you.

655
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:28,080
- Commander Powell speaking.
- <i>Egan?</i>

656
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,670
- <i>Can you bunk out tonight?</i>
- I can manage.

657
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:33,359
Thanks, Egan.

658
01:05:40,560 --> 01:05:41,834
Maggie?

659
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,118
Yes, Rock.

660
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:37,397
Permission to board, sir?

661
01:06:37,600 --> 01:06:43,470
- State your business.
- Cdr. Eddington. Toulebonne Base.

662
01:06:43,680 --> 01:06:48,356
- I'd like to see Nurse Lt. Maggie Haynes.
- Permission granted.

663
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:08,950
Ahoy, there! Is this the admiral's harem?

664
01:07:09,160 --> 01:07:11,958
Lieutenant Maggie Haynes!

665
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:15,835
- I'm here.
- Compliments of Capt. Rockwell Torrey.

666
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:20,591
Paul Eddington. I'll call you Maggie
because that's what the Rock said.

667
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:24,759
"Make sure Maggie's welcome
when she gets to Toulebonne," so...

668
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:26,916
Welcome, Maggie Haynes.

669
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:29,672
It's beautiful.

670
01:07:29,880 --> 01:07:33,236
There's a bottle of cognac
under the bananas.

671
01:07:33,440 --> 01:07:36,398
I know how dry
these naval transports can get.

672
01:07:37,920 --> 01:07:40,036
Will you excuse me?

673
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:42,037
<i>Soyez la bienvenue.</i>

674
01:07:44,560 --> 01:07:46,198
This is Annalee Dorne.

675
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:47,879
- Hi.
- Hi.

676
01:07:49,120 --> 01:07:53,238
- You've been here a long time.
- Since January.

677
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:57,115
Getting this old French base
ready to service our ships.

678
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:01,916
You have a barracks for 50 nurses?
We've been on this tub three weeks.

679
01:08:02,120 --> 01:08:04,634
- Didn't you get the word?
- No.

680
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:09,675
This convoy sails again tonight,
300 miles to an island named Gavabutu.

681
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:13,350
- That's where they'll need nurses.
- An offensive?

682
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,312
I guess so.

683
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:18,034
- Are you also going to Gavabutu?
- No!

684
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:21,915
The Navy can't do without me here,
the island might sink!

685
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:24,156
You don't like what you're doing?

686
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:29,514
It's like working in a filling station,
watching the cars go by.

687
01:08:29,720 --> 01:08:31,472
Goodbye, Maggie Haynes.

688
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,672
When you write to the Rock,
tell him I was sober.

689
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,031
He won't believe it, but tell him anyway.

690
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:40,633
Bye, Commander.

691
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:09,149
Control...? Station 26.

692
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:14,034
I have him.
PBY approaching from south-west.

693
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:18,119
- <i>Roger 26. Patrol plane off course.</i>
- Hi.

694
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:20,834
- <i>Spotter 26.</i>
- 26.

695
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:25,397
<i>Formation north-east of your station.</i>
<i>Should be F4Fs.</i>

696
01:09:27,760 --> 01:09:33,278
Check, Control.
Three F4Fs proceeding north-east...

697
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:36,153
...to south-west.
- <i>Roger, 26.</i>

698
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:41,673
- You read those planes pretty quickly.
- At first I couldn't tell them apart.

699
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:43,154
How are you?

700
01:09:44,400 --> 01:09:47,392
There's no way to make this easy,
Mrs McConnel.

701
01:09:47,600 --> 01:09:51,434
I came to tell you
that your husband is missing in action.

702
01:09:53,280 --> 01:09:57,990
You won't get the official telegram
for a day or two.

703
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:01,829
I read it in a report this morning and...

704
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,908
Ask Control to relieve you.
I'll take you home.

705
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:11,350
I'm all right.

706
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:15,039
Where did it happen?

707
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:19,518
His destroyer was working alone
in the Gavabutu area.

708
01:10:19,720 --> 01:10:26,353
Reported two aerial torpedo hits,
then communications were cut off.

709
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,509
An aerial search the following day
failed to produce anything.

710
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:36,708
- No survivors at all?
- None reported.

711
01:10:36,920 --> 01:10:39,070
<i>Station 26.</i>

712
01:10:39,280 --> 01:10:41,475
- <i>Are you there, 26?</i>
- 26.

713
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:45,673
<i>We have a bogey on the screen</i>
<i>to the south. Can you see it?</i>

714
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,718
AT-6, about 9,000 feet.

715
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:06,918
- <i>Are you there, 26?</i>
- AT-6, Control.

716
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,590
<i>Those damn training planes</i>
<i>wander around like bats.</i>

717
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:13,872
<i>OK, 26. Over and out.</i>

718
01:11:14,080 --> 01:11:15,433
Thanks.

719
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:20,911
Captain, was Mac wasted?

720
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,475
Wasted? What do you mean?

721
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:31,353
I want to read you
part of a letter from Mac.

722
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:43,790
"We are getting hell from Jap planes
that are based right on Gavabutu.

723
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,833
"I don't know much
about amphibious operations,

724
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,713
"but if Admiral Broderick knows anything,
I'll eat my hat.

725
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:53,912
"This has been a mess
since it began..."

726
01:11:54,120 --> 01:11:58,352
I'm surprised that Mac
would put that in a letter.

727
01:11:59,240 --> 01:12:04,234
He wouldn't have,
unless he were discouraged and angry.

728
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,709
Beverly, don't show that letter to anyone.

729
01:12:08,920 --> 01:12:12,629
I don't intend to... Is it true?

730
01:12:12,840 --> 01:12:17,311
If it is, if things are that bad,
I'm sure there'll be some changes.

731
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,432
Aren't they that bad, Captain?

732
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:23,954
Yes, I believe they are.

733
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:25,593
<i>Station 26.</i>

734
01:12:27,320 --> 01:12:31,791
- 26, Control.
- <i>Check plane to north-east.</i>

735
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,672
Check, Control.

736
01:12:36,200 --> 01:12:41,513
Small training plane
moving north-east to south-west...

737
01:12:48,960 --> 01:12:51,474
- Message from CinCPac.
- What is it?

738
01:12:51,680 --> 01:12:55,389
You're requested to appear
at 10 Makalapa for dinner.

739
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:57,113
Early, sir. 1800.

740
01:12:57,320 --> 01:13:01,154
- You'll just have time to change.
- OK, Simpson.

741
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:02,952
Take me home.

742
01:13:05,480 --> 01:13:09,837
Gentlemen, we'll get to
the business of the evening.

743
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:14,079
I could have saved time and liquor
by doing this in my office,

744
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:16,475
but it needs a little ceremony.

745
01:13:16,680 --> 01:13:18,910
Powell, you got that dispatch?

746
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:32,878
From Chief of Naval Personnel
to Capt. Rockwell Torrey.

747
01:13:33,080 --> 01:13:37,676
You are advised that the President
has approved your advancement

748
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:42,158
to temporary grade of Rear Admiral,
lower half, date 1 August 1942.

749
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:44,954
In regards to promotion,
physical examination...

750
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:48,277
...acceptance of appointment,
and so forth.

751
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,274
This came about, Admiral Torrey,

752
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:00,792
because that civilian next to you
wormed his way into my staff

753
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:06,677
and had the audacity to suggest
the Navy was wrong in judging you.

754
01:14:06,880 --> 01:14:10,668
Well, we all know
the Navy's never wrong, but...

755
01:14:10,880 --> 01:14:15,078
...in this case,
it was a little weak on being right.

756
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:18,989
- So, congratulations, Admiral Torrey.
- Thank you, sir.

757
01:14:19,200 --> 01:14:22,954
- Powell, you can do the honours.
- Thank you, sir.

758
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:27,233
Gentlemen, to Admiral Rockwell Torrey.

759
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:31,513
- May success follow your flag.
- Hear, hear!

760
01:14:31,720 --> 01:14:34,757
I do thank you and I'm grateful.

761
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:36,996
With your permission, sir.

762
01:14:37,200 --> 01:14:41,512
To our country, our Navy,
and all the best things they stand for.

763
01:14:41,720 --> 01:14:42,994
Hear, hear!

764
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,676
Admiral Torrey,
when the congratulations peter out,

765
01:14:47,880 --> 01:14:50,952
please join Cdr. Powell
and me in my study.

766
01:14:51,160 --> 01:14:54,232
- Gentlemen, I'll see y'all later.
- Goodnight.

767
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:56,032
<i>Congratulations, Rock...</i>

768
01:14:58,600 --> 01:15:02,479
We gave him the molasses,
now let's feed him the sulphur.

769
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:05,314
Admiral...

770
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,869
...know what that is?

771
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:11,878
Yes, from the shape of those islands.

772
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:16,517
This is Gavabutu, Levu-Vana,
Toko-Rota and Pala Passage.

773
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:18,551
It's Skýhook.

774
01:15:18,760 --> 01:15:21,513
Powell says you guessed
the strategy months ago.

775
01:15:21,720 --> 01:15:24,473
- A wild guess, sir.
- Wild, but accurate.

776
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:27,638
- What's your opinion of it?
- In theory, good.

777
01:15:27,840 --> 01:15:29,432
In fact?

778
01:15:29,640 --> 01:15:31,995
Delay has cost you the surprise element.

779
01:15:32,200 --> 01:15:35,272
How far has Broderick
advanced on Gavabutu?

780
01:15:35,480 --> 01:15:41,157
He's bottled up behind these mountains.
Hasn't advanced an inch in four weeks.

781
01:15:41,360 --> 01:15:46,036
He'd better take that whole island
or you can forget Skýhook.

782
01:15:48,560 --> 01:15:50,437
He's got to attack Levu-Vana
before the Japs are ready.

783
01:15:50,640 --> 01:15:52,631
You just named your own poison.

784
01:15:52,840 --> 01:15:57,231
You're going to mop up Gavabutu
and mount the invasion of Levu-Vana.

785
01:15:57,440 --> 01:15:59,635
How about Admiral Broderick, sir?

786
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:06,070
Some smart man once said
that on the most exalted throne

787
01:16:06,280 --> 01:16:09,192
we are seated on nothing
but our own arse.

788
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,550
With Broderick, I'm on mine.

789
01:16:11,760 --> 01:16:15,639
I can't fire him,
scramble his whole command overnight.

790
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,877
He's bad for our allies,
a comfort to the enemy.

791
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:23,596
All I can do is put you
in tactical command of the operation.

792
01:16:23,800 --> 01:16:28,032
Abe Lincoln was once in the same spot
with George B McClellan.

793
01:16:28,240 --> 01:16:32,677
McClellan was a great organiser
but he couldn't decide when to fight.

794
01:16:33,720 --> 01:16:36,996
Indecision is a virus
that can run through an army

795
01:16:37,200 --> 01:16:40,749
and destroy its will to win,
or even to survive.

796
01:16:42,160 --> 01:16:46,790
Lincoln called in a Yankee named Grant
who didn't care about organisation

797
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,434
but wasn't afflicted with the virus.

798
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:53,679
He pointed his battalions
in the right direction and shoved off.

799
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:56,269
Torrey, you're going to be my Grant.

800
01:16:56,480 --> 01:17:01,031
How you deal with Broderick
is your business. Just get the job done.

801
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:04,232
How far can I go with Admiral Broderick?

802
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:06,317
You can't kill him.

803
01:17:06,520 --> 01:17:09,239
- May I name my own chief of staff?
- Who?

804
01:17:09,440 --> 01:17:12,477
- Eddington, my old exec.
- I'll attend to it.

805
01:17:12,680 --> 01:17:17,470
Take Powell with you, he's familiar
with Broderick and I want rid of him.

806
01:17:17,680 --> 01:17:20,911
- Reserve officers give me hay fever.
- Thank you.

807
01:17:21,120 --> 01:17:25,875
Torrey, these were my stars
before I picked up this heavy hardware.

808
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,753
I like to think they brought me luck.

809
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,870
Wear 'em on your collar.

810
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:36,312
If there's any luck in 'em,
you're gonna need it.

811
01:17:36,520 --> 01:17:37,873
Thank you, sir.

812
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:06,637
Saree?

813
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,353
Saree?
