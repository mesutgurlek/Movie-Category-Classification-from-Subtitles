1
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:22,931
Kadokawa.

2
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,076
Water?

3
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:09,545
Ready.

4
00:04:44,426 --> 00:04:45,826
The officials have all fled.

5
00:04:46,588 --> 00:04:47,578
Let us out.

6
00:04:47,949 --> 00:04:49,623
Let us out.

7
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:52,622
The commander has fled.

8
00:04:52,874 --> 00:04:54,103
Let us out.

9
00:04:57,078 --> 00:04:58,432
No retreat allowed.

10
00:04:58,960 --> 00:04:59,551
Nobody can leave the city.

11
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:01,597
Let us out.

12
00:05:02,843 --> 00:05:03,959
Nobody can leave the city.

13
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:05,074
Brothers, go.

14
00:05:23,503 --> 00:05:24,823
Let us out.

15
00:06:00,137 --> 00:06:03,576
Banzai.

16
00:07:57,967 --> 00:07:59,641
Hurry to the lake.

17
00:08:26,474 --> 00:08:27,190
Don't drink that.

18
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:29,386
It might be a trap.

19
00:08:30,197 --> 00:08:30,789
Yes.

20
00:08:35,522 --> 00:08:37,037
How is it?

21
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:38,601
Quite tasty.

22
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:44,563
Very delicious.

23
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:53,888
What are you doing?

24
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:56,178
It's delicious.

25
00:08:57,142 --> 00:09:00,296
Attention: Search and arrest Chinese soldiers.

26
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:04,741
Attention: Search and arrest Chinese soldiers.

27
00:09:13,398 --> 00:09:13,750
Disperse.

28
00:09:14,198 --> 00:09:14,836
Yes.

29
00:09:19,964 --> 00:09:20,601
Stop the car.

30
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,690
Anyone of you speak English?

31
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:34,488
German.

32
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:35,330
Put the guns down.

33
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:36,938
Kadokawa, listen.

34
00:09:39,502 --> 00:09:41,335
You speak German or English?

35
00:09:43,346 --> 00:09:44,621
I study in church school.

36
00:09:45,868 --> 00:09:48,384
I wish to speak to your senior officer.

37
00:09:49,912 --> 00:09:50,789
Senior officer?

38
00:09:50,833 --> 00:09:53,269
Yes, your senior officer.

39
00:09:54,156 --> 00:09:56,228
He wants to see the General.

40
00:09:57,999 --> 00:09:59,434
We'd like to see the General too.

41
00:10:00,562 --> 00:10:01,962
This is the safety zone.

42
00:10:02,804 --> 00:10:04,238
We only have refugees in here.

43
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:07,477
Friend.

44
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,007
Let's go.

45
00:10:17,618 --> 00:10:18,495
You need to brush up your English.

46
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:19,697
Let's go.

47
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,536
Yes.

48
00:10:20,581 --> 00:10:21,536
Wait. Please wait.

49
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:22,378
Come on. Let's go.

50
00:10:22,422 --> 00:10:23,139
Please wait.

51
00:10:27,587 --> 00:10:28,498
Sergeant.

52
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:31,388
Looks like someone has gone in.

53
00:10:33,272 --> 00:10:33,864
Follow me.

54
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,312
Attention.

55
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:29,256
Hurry, call for reinforcement.

56
00:12:41,713 --> 00:12:45,550
Chinese soldiers.

57
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:53,116
Chinese soldiers.

58
00:13:08,097 --> 00:13:09,133
Over there.

59
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:12,256
Chinese soldiers over there.

60
00:13:14,143 --> 00:13:16,295
Chinese soldiers over there.

61
00:13:25,273 --> 00:13:27,425
Chinese soldiers over there.

62
00:13:37,725 --> 00:13:38,282
Sit down.

63
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:41,204
Stay still.

64
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,280
Hurry.

65
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:46,569
Tie them up.

66
00:13:51,138 --> 00:13:54,451
135, 136... - 140... -

67
00:13:59,946 --> 00:14:00,298
Please.

68
00:14:00,546 --> 00:14:01,901
Don't take him away.

69
00:14:03,429 --> 00:14:04,146
Kadokawa.

70
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:04,980
Come over there.

71
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:06,949
Get out of the way.

72
00:14:08,193 --> 00:14:08,944
What's happening?

73
00:14:44,908 --> 00:14:45,579
I didn't mean to.

74
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,395
Kadokawa.

75
00:15:01,363 --> 00:15:02,080
Hurry up.

76
00:15:10,972 --> 00:15:11,450
May.

77
00:15:13,615 --> 00:15:15,129
Our luggage was robbed in broad daylight.

78
00:15:16,217 --> 00:15:16,889
OK. OK.

79
00:15:17,498 --> 00:15:18,090
Thank you.

80
00:15:18,459 --> 00:15:19,017
My sweetie.

81
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,177
Daddy.

82
00:15:26,627 --> 00:15:27,538
Mr. Tang, you're back.

83
00:15:28,989 --> 00:15:29,227
Mr. Tang,

84
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:30,660
your bed has been fixed.

85
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:31,268
Thank you.

86
00:15:31,632 --> 00:15:33,305
Give me a shout if you need anything.

87
00:15:33,834 --> 00:15:34,710
Thank you.

88
00:15:38,518 --> 00:15:39,156
Thank you for your hard work.

89
00:15:40,119 --> 00:15:42,032
Empty the trash.

90
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:42,840
Yes.

91
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:43,953
I'm on it.

92
00:15:47,807 --> 00:15:48,637
Go play with your auntie.

93
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:54,729
Where should we sleep tonight?

94
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:55,532
Stop it.

95
00:15:58,697 --> 00:15:59,574
You fixed it up pretty nicely.

96
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:03,932
Is Nanking safe?

97
00:16:04,823 --> 00:16:06,098
We work for the Germans.

98
00:16:06,304 --> 00:16:07,260
We are safe.

99
00:16:08,946 --> 00:16:09,982
What about this month's pay?

100
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:16,104
Attention.

101
00:16:17,795 --> 00:16:19,024
Let's pull together.

102
00:16:21,238 --> 00:16:23,708
1, 2, 3

103
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,044
Stop. Just leave the tank for our troops.

104
00:17:11,085 --> 00:17:11,756
Yes.

105
00:17:14,087 --> 00:17:15,157
Report:

106
00:17:15,248 --> 00:17:16,399
Everything's clear.

107
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:18,289
Bastard.

108
00:17:18,732 --> 00:17:19,323
Stay alert.

109
00:17:33,025 --> 00:17:34,061
Yes.

110
00:17:34,506 --> 00:17:35,019
Chinese.

111
00:17:37,629 --> 00:17:38,221
Lay down.

112
00:17:41,793 --> 00:17:42,510
Spare out.

113
00:17:49,881 --> 00:17:50,917
Where are the Chinese?

114
00:17:57,528 --> 00:17:58,644
Upstairs.

115
00:17:58,689 --> 00:17:59,600
Watch your back.

116
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:08,447
We're surrounded.

117
00:18:13,183 --> 00:18:13,899
Morishita.

118
00:18:13,943 --> 00:18:14,615
Kadokawa.

119
00:18:16,946 --> 00:18:17,584
Yes.

120
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:35,954
Over here.

121
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:39,442
We attack from below.

122
00:18:47,455 --> 00:18:48,205
It's dangerous here too.

123
00:18:48,255 --> 00:18:48,688
You go first.

124
00:19:03,149 --> 00:19:03,741
Yes.

125
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:06,904
Stairs over there.

126
00:19:10,036 --> 00:19:10,867
Go.

127
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:24,688
Damn. Get cover.

128
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:25,928
Shunzi, go see what's going on downstairs.

129
00:19:41,105 --> 00:19:42,380
Guns.

130
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,555
Go get more bullets.

131
00:23:17,227 --> 00:23:18,456
Shunzi.

132
00:23:30,479 --> 00:23:31,196
Brothers.

133
00:23:34,924 --> 00:23:35,674
We can't hold out any longer.

134
00:23:39,128 --> 00:23:39,844
Let's disperse.

135
00:24:52,556 --> 00:24:53,228
Give it to me.

136
00:24:57,241 --> 00:24:57,912
Kadokawa.

137
00:24:58,001 --> 00:24:58,479
Yes.

138
00:25:45,486 --> 00:25:46,522
Get a ladder and climb up.

139
00:25:47,568 --> 00:25:49,161
Faster.

140
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:49,881
Be careful.

141
00:25:51,491 --> 00:25:52,322
Go.

142
00:25:52,933 --> 00:25:54,447
Kill any Chinese soldiers on sight.

143
00:25:54,694 --> 00:25:56,732
There might be Chinese soldiers upstairs.

144
00:26:15,474 --> 00:26:16,430
Load the canons.

145
00:26:19,638 --> 00:26:20,275
Fire.

146
00:27:16,131 --> 00:27:17,201
Advance.

147
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,711
Kadokawa.

148
00:27:55,648 --> 00:27:56,603
Are you hurt?

149
00:27:56,969 --> 00:27:57,719
I'm fine.

150
00:28:55,664 --> 00:28:57,303
Banzai.

151
00:28:58,827 --> 00:28:59,623
One more photo.

152
00:29:05,753 --> 00:29:08,828
Great. We can finally eat our hearts out.

153
00:29:09,076 --> 00:29:11,194
Come give me a hand.

154
00:29:12,199 --> 00:29:13,474
Take them all.

155
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,234
This is good stuff.

156
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:17,398
Must be expensive.

157
00:29:20,567 --> 00:29:21,159
Right here.

158
00:29:21,808 --> 00:29:22,685
Hurry up.

159
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:30,093
Fire.

160
00:30:37,999 --> 00:30:39,593
Move.

161
00:30:44,846 --> 00:30:45,643
Hurry up.

162
00:30:48,769 --> 00:30:49,566
What the hell are you looking at?

163
00:30:54,054 --> 00:30:56,332
We've captured over 500 Chinese soldiers.

164
00:30:56,377 --> 00:30:57,287
Okay.

165
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:03,941
Move in.

166
00:31:05,145 --> 00:31:05,861
What the hell are you looking at?

167
00:31:07,107 --> 00:31:07,698
Hurry.

168
00:31:14,954 --> 00:31:16,104
What the hell are you looking at?

169
00:31:29,968 --> 00:31:31,688
Come and help here.

170
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:32,720
Yes.

171
00:32:08,724 --> 00:32:09,840
We need more over there.

172
00:32:13,449 --> 00:32:14,360
Douse it like this.

173
00:32:22,337 --> 00:32:23,373
Stand up.

174
00:32:49,602 --> 00:32:52,722
Turn back.

175
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:01,122
Turn back.

176
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,770
Move forward.

177
00:33:17,909 --> 00:33:18,865
Go.

178
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,234
Fire.

179
00:35:11,816 --> 00:35:12,612
Grenades.

180
00:36:52,149 --> 00:36:52,741
Stand up.

181
00:36:57,835 --> 00:36:58,267
Stand up.

182
00:36:58,515 --> 00:36:59,392
Stand up.

183
00:37:04,801 --> 00:37:05,678
Bastard.

184
00:37:22,978 --> 00:37:23,855
Stand up.

185
00:37:23,899 --> 00:37:25,619
Stand up.

186
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,717
Long live China.

187
00:42:04,762 --> 00:42:09,362
China shall not perish.

188
00:44:42,630 --> 00:44:44,428
Take one number.

189
00:44:44,631 --> 00:44:45,667
Don't push.

190
00:44:46,033 --> 00:44:47,023
What's the hurry?

191
00:44:47,914 --> 00:44:48,631
Speak slowly.

192
00:44:48,715 --> 00:44:49,353
No need to rush.

193
00:44:50,237 --> 00:44:51,113
Don't take so many.

194
00:44:51,918 --> 00:44:52,795
Miss, you can't take too many.

195
00:44:52,879 --> 00:44:53,949
One number for one bed.

196
00:44:54,441 --> 00:44:55,078
What?

197
00:44:55,321 --> 00:44:55,913
Let go of me.

198
00:44:56,122 --> 00:44:56,600
Be reasonable.

199
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:06,082
Go back to the tent.

200
00:45:06,572 --> 00:45:07,483
Go back to the tent.

201
00:45:08,534 --> 00:45:09,445
Miss Jiang.

202
00:46:25,606 --> 00:46:26,562
You are alive.

203
00:46:27,047 --> 00:46:27,400
Still alive.

204
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:42,130
How many were executed?

205
00:46:44,824 --> 00:46:45,381
All of them.

206
00:46:48,067 --> 00:46:49,786
Only the two of us survive.

207
00:46:59,958 --> 00:47:00,356
Ready.

208
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:02,997
Good job.

209
00:47:04,803 --> 00:47:05,235
Ready.

210
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:07,880
Well done.

211
00:47:08,286 --> 00:47:08,763
Furuta.

212
00:47:08,846 --> 00:47:09,836
My turn.

213
00:47:11,689 --> 00:47:12,166
Ready.

214
00:47:14,652 --> 00:47:15,529
Great.

215
00:47:17,895 --> 00:47:18,726
I want to eat hotpot.

216
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:20,053
Hotpot is good.

217
00:47:20,777 --> 00:47:22,770
I want to eat yam.

218
00:47:24,581 --> 00:47:26,061
Your mom makes the best yam.

219
00:47:26,303 --> 00:47:26,815
Yes.

220
00:47:29,506 --> 00:47:30,416
Your mom must be so happy.

221
00:47:31,948 --> 00:47:34,100
I hear you are getting a promotion.

222
00:47:35,551 --> 00:47:36,109
Me?

223
00:47:37,954 --> 00:47:39,024
It pays to be educated.

224
00:47:41,277 --> 00:47:42,427
1, 2, 3, 4

225
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,239
Homesick.

226
00:47:47,723 --> 00:47:48,439
Ueno.

227
00:47:48,764 --> 00:47:50,118
You are dancing the girl's part.

228
00:47:51,246 --> 00:47:51,997
Come join in.

229
00:47:58,853 --> 00:48:00,207
Are you ready for the celebration?

230
00:48:00,254 --> 00:48:01,165
No.

231
00:48:02,136 --> 00:48:04,447
You need to practice your dancing.

232
00:48:04,498 --> 00:48:05,249
Yes.

233
00:48:07,621 --> 00:48:08,896
Shit. It's freezing.

234
00:48:10,664 --> 00:48:11,575
It's freezing.

235
00:48:11,865 --> 00:48:13,220
Pass me the ball.

236
00:48:19,272 --> 00:48:23,315
A few Japanese comfort women just arrived.

237
00:48:23,756 --> 00:48:26,751
They are all very sweet.

238
00:48:28,321 --> 00:48:28,912
Hello.

239
00:48:33,125 --> 00:48:33,876
Wait a moment.

240
00:48:35,127 --> 00:48:35,844
Please.

241
00:49:06,997 --> 00:49:07,474
Give it to me.

242
00:49:26,495 --> 00:49:27,975
Sorry.

243
00:49:47,795 --> 00:49:48,751
Your first time?

244
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:53,317
Come here.

245
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:09,091
Please take off your clothes.

246
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:36,676
My name is Kadokawa.

247
00:50:52,135 --> 00:50:53,046
Sergeant,

248
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:54,768
how do you feel?

249
00:50:58,141 --> 00:51:00,418
I'm going to marry that woman.

250
00:51:03,666 --> 00:51:04,178
Sergeant,

251
00:51:04,627 --> 00:51:06,506
I got venereal disease here.

252
00:51:06,909 --> 00:51:10,872
Did you get venereal disease in your brain?

253
00:51:20,402 --> 00:51:21,995
Friend.

254
00:51:22,043 --> 00:51:25,561
In Japanese, "friend" is "tomodachi."

255
00:51:27,728 --> 00:51:30,564
I am a civilian.

256
00:51:38,939 --> 00:51:40,453
You say it.

257
00:51:41,021 --> 00:51:42,854
I am a civilian.

258
00:51:44,424 --> 00:51:45,824
You say it

259
00:51:45,865 --> 00:51:47,858
I am a civilian.

260
00:51:48,228 --> 00:51:48,944
Very good.

261
00:51:48,988 --> 00:51:50,138
My dear, you say it.

262
00:51:50,189 --> 00:51:51,340
Three of a kind.

263
00:51:52,912 --> 00:51:53,789
May, you say it.

264
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:54,984
Don't bother me.

265
00:51:55,915 --> 00:51:57,588
I win.

266
00:52:02,121 --> 00:52:03,953
Daddy, there are fireworks outside.

267
00:52:04,523 --> 00:52:05,718
Hush.

268
00:52:07,205 --> 00:52:09,563
It's almost New Year. Go to bed.

269
00:52:24,301 --> 00:52:25,132
Sorry.

270
00:52:26,784 --> 00:52:28,537
Don't go downstairs.

271
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:33,944
Oh, my God.

272
00:52:34,311 --> 00:52:35,347
Stop.

273
00:52:36,513 --> 00:52:37,742
Stay back.

274
00:52:38,034 --> 00:52:38,353
Get away.

275
00:52:40,837 --> 00:52:41,508
Who the hell are you?

276
00:52:42,478 --> 00:52:43,355
Don't pull me.

277
00:52:45,441 --> 00:52:46,876
No.

278
00:52:48,404 --> 00:52:49,633
Stop.

279
00:52:55,851 --> 00:52:56,921
Stop it at once.

280
00:52:57,292 --> 00:52:58,487
Get out of here.

281
00:52:58,533 --> 00:52:59,809
Who the hell are you?

282
00:52:59,855 --> 00:53:01,494
A friend.

283
00:53:01,897 --> 00:53:03,331
A Nazi.

284
00:53:03,378 --> 00:53:04,448
A friend.

285
00:53:07,982 --> 00:53:08,733
Was it him?

286
00:53:11,986 --> 00:53:12,658
Was it him?

287
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:18,463
A friend.

288
00:53:20,034 --> 00:53:20,750
Let's go.

289
00:53:20,794 --> 00:53:21,910
Yes.

290
00:53:28,481 --> 00:53:29,962
Do you speak Japanese?

291
00:53:30,724 --> 00:53:33,160
Yes, a little.

292
00:53:33,206 --> 00:53:34,526
What do you do?

293
00:53:36,769 --> 00:53:38,250
Mr. Rabe's secretary.

294
00:53:57,228 --> 00:54:00,861
How many children were raped here tonight?

295
00:54:01,432 --> 00:54:02,867
Six, sir.

296
00:54:40,189 --> 00:54:41,589
From tomorrow on,

297
00:54:43,912 --> 00:54:47,430
you and May must wear men's clothes.

298
00:55:14,821 --> 00:55:16,096
Wipe off your nail polish.

299
00:55:16,142 --> 00:55:17,292
Lipstick.

300
00:55:17,343 --> 00:55:18,094
Hair.

301
00:55:18,384 --> 00:55:20,947
Miss Jiang, come.

302
00:55:21,427 --> 00:55:22,781
Look. These three girls, especially her.

303
00:55:26,272 --> 00:55:27,342
Why you refused to cut your hair?

304
00:55:29,274 --> 00:55:30,230
Why didn't you?

305
00:55:31,797 --> 00:55:32,913
You even have permed hair.

306
00:55:33,438 --> 00:55:35,635
We are from the Committee.
The Japanese won't hurt us.

307
00:55:36,681 --> 00:55:37,751
To have you cut your hair is to protect you.

308
00:55:37,842 --> 00:55:38,719
Don't be so stubborn.

309
00:55:39,964 --> 00:55:40,954
I won't cut it.

310
00:55:42,447 --> 00:55:44,440
I need it to feed myself when the war is over.

311
00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:45,759
You want to go back to the streets?

312
00:55:46,691 --> 00:55:47,681
So what if I earn my own living?

313
00:55:48,853 --> 00:55:50,367
You can't even if you want to.

314
00:55:50,414 --> 00:55:51,404
How dare you?

315
00:55:58,502 --> 00:55:59,458
You must cut it.

316
00:55:59,503 --> 00:56:00,333
Take them over there.

317
00:56:00,384 --> 00:56:01,134
Go.

318
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,469
That's a good idea.

319
00:56:20,843 --> 00:56:21,754
You are smart.

320
00:56:23,926 --> 00:56:25,326
Don't scare them.

321
00:56:30,412 --> 00:56:33,486
Don't be afraid.

322
00:56:37,418 --> 00:56:38,408
Look.

323
00:56:43,584 --> 00:56:44,654
Come.

324
00:56:46,947 --> 00:56:47,778
The Japanese are coming.

325
00:56:47,868 --> 00:56:48,858
Go hide inside.

326
00:56:48,949 --> 00:56:50,019
Hello.

327
00:56:51,271 --> 00:56:52,341
It's congee.

328
00:56:54,794 --> 00:56:55,945
Look.

329
00:56:56,036 --> 00:56:57,789
A pretty girl.

330
00:56:59,439 --> 00:57:00,953
Very cute.

331
00:57:01,040 --> 00:57:02,873
Your type.

332
00:57:08,127 --> 00:57:08,958
You kids, go play.

333
00:57:14,293 --> 00:57:16,125
Let's get the flags.

334
00:57:16,615 --> 00:57:18,049
What are you doing?

335
00:57:18,376 --> 00:57:19,891
Here they come.

336
00:57:20,058 --> 00:57:21,618
Go. Run.

337
00:57:25,383 --> 00:57:26,817
Get out.

338
00:57:52,138 --> 00:57:53,538
Please, let my daughter go.

339
00:58:06,031 --> 00:58:07,465
They fell for the trap.

340
00:59:05,687 --> 00:59:06,438
Don't touch her.

341
00:59:13,214 --> 00:59:14,125
She's dead.

342
00:59:31,111 --> 00:59:31,941
Xiaojiang.

343
01:00:09,907 --> 01:00:11,261
Happy New Year.

344
01:00:12,429 --> 01:00:13,579
Happy New Year.

345
01:00:21,278 --> 01:00:22,348
I'm here for you.

346
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,431
Please.

347
01:00:34,450 --> 01:00:35,930
New Year's gifts for you.

348
01:00:39,214 --> 01:00:40,170
For me?

349
01:01:07,801 --> 01:01:08,473
Canned fish.

350
01:01:12,566 --> 01:01:13,123
Candy.

351
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:27,329
So sweet.

352
01:01:36,668 --> 01:01:38,342
I love this sticky cake.

353
01:01:47,078 --> 01:01:47,909
Sake.

354
01:02:03,013 --> 01:02:04,447
It even has the smell from home.

355
01:02:05,855 --> 01:02:06,845
Yes.

356
01:02:12,101 --> 01:02:13,376
Sorry.

357
01:02:17,466 --> 01:02:19,937
Please go ahead.

358
01:02:24,112 --> 01:02:25,102
I'm... -

359
01:02:26,315 --> 01:02:28,034
Kadokawa.

360
01:02:29,117 --> 01:02:29,630
Please.

361
01:02:29,878 --> 01:02:30,789
Mr. Kadokawa.

362
01:02:34,202 --> 01:02:34,714
Yes.

363
01:02:46,133 --> 01:02:47,487
Finished?

364
01:02:54,901 --> 01:02:57,063
Don't dance like that. Do it gently.

365
01:02:57,063 --> 01:02:59,065
Look, I'll show you.

366
01:02:59,065 --> 01:03:01,297
Is it like this?

367
01:03:01,347 --> 01:03:03,910
Hey, wait.

368
01:03:06,072 --> 01:03:06,903
Friend.

369
01:03:12,358 --> 01:03:13,758
I don't smoke.

370
01:03:16,321 --> 01:03:17,516
Try it.

371
01:03:23,168 --> 01:03:24,449
Friend.

372
01:03:24,449 --> 01:03:26,008
Good?

373
01:03:26,371 --> 01:03:27,167
Look.

374
01:03:27,852 --> 01:03:29,081
Japanese tobacco.

375
01:03:30,695 --> 01:03:31,685
I don't smoke.

376
01:03:32,456 --> 01:03:33,777
Take it.

377
01:03:42,786 --> 01:03:43,936
Good morning.

378
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:44,620
Good morning.

379
01:03:45,108 --> 01:03:46,019
Thank you, Mr. Tang.

380
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:47,462
Mr. Tang.

381
01:03:47,551 --> 01:03:50,625
Two Japanese came for you with your name card.

382
01:03:52,115 --> 01:03:52,866
OK.

383
01:03:56,559 --> 01:04:00,202
Do you remember I wrote to the Führer?

384
01:04:00,202 --> 01:04:01,272
Yes.

385
01:04:02,284 --> 01:04:05,199
I've been told... -

386
01:04:05,367 --> 01:04:06,039
Yes.

387
01:04:09,211 --> 01:04:14,495
I've been ordered to return to Germany at once.

388
01:04:15,657 --> 01:04:20,895
They say that my activities

389
01:04:20,982 --> 01:04:30,069
to protect the refugees in Nanking

390
01:04:32,232 --> 01:04:32,983
So?

391
01:04:34,314 --> 01:04:35,996
So?

392
01:04:35,996 --> 01:04:38,318
So I have no choice.

393
01:04:38,318 --> 01:04:40,080
I must return to Germany.

394
01:04:40,080 --> 01:04:41,400
Mr. Rabe,

395
01:04:42,522 --> 01:04:43,751
what about me?

396
01:04:46,005 --> 01:04:47,759
What about my wife and daughter?

397
01:04:47,847 --> 01:04:49,521
They 're still living in the camp.

398
01:04:51,010 --> 01:04:52,764
We all depend on you.

399
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:00,858
I'm so sorry.

400
01:05:02,781 --> 01:05:06,094
Mr. Rabe will abandon us?

401
01:05:09,868 --> 01:05:11,780
Now can he do that?

402
01:05:17,435 --> 01:05:19,347
You literally built his business.

403
01:05:22,039 --> 01:05:23,359
He just says bye and walks off.

404
01:05:30,567 --> 01:05:31,967
What shall we do?

405
01:05:44,300 --> 01:05:45,370
The Japanese

406
01:05:45,461 --> 01:05:46,451
have come for me.

407
01:05:50,225 --> 01:05:51,136
Where are you going?

408
01:05:54,389 --> 01:05:55,824
What are you doing?

409
01:05:57,072 --> 01:05:58,745
I'll work it out.

410
01:06:13,527 --> 01:06:17,079
In case you need to bribe a Japanese.

411
01:06:22,095 --> 01:06:23,529
Give it back to me when you come back.

412
01:08:06,032 --> 01:08:06,943
Please.

413
01:08:13,279 --> 01:08:17,879
Drive the refugees out of the
safety zone. Reestablish order.

414
01:08:18,124 --> 01:08:21,199
Set up the Comfort Stations quickly.

415
01:08:22,448 --> 01:08:25,362
The soldiers are getting unruly.

416
01:08:28,373 --> 01:08:29,888
Mr. Tomita,

417
01:08:31,296 --> 01:08:32,970
this is Mr Tang,

418
01:08:33,378 --> 01:08:35,211
Mr Rabe's secretary.

419
01:08:36,221 --> 01:08:37,621
Welcome.

420
01:08:38,543 --> 01:08:49,225
Remember our oaths at the grassy bridge.

421
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:54,389
Together we have studied three long years.

422
01:08:54,478 --> 01:08:56,231
Kitty, come here.

423
01:09:01,084 --> 01:09:10,764
With each other we are deeply in love.

424
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:24,019
This heart of mine has long been yours to keep.

425
01:09:24,586 --> 01:09:25,781
Hold out your hands.

426
01:09:25,947 --> 01:09:26,778
Here.

427
01:09:28,349 --> 01:09:29,951
That's good.

428
01:09:29,951 --> 01:09:31,704
Miss Jiang.

429
01:09:33,114 --> 01:09:37,714
Remember you discovered my earring holes.

430
01:09:43,203 --> 01:09:44,114
That is to say

431
01:09:44,524 --> 01:09:46,882
there are still Chinese soldiers
in the Safely Zone?

432
01:09:49,369 --> 01:09:51,601
Yes. Most are injured.

433
01:09:53,052 --> 01:09:54,453
Thanks, Mr Tang.

434
01:09:54,974 --> 01:09:56,694
You've helped a lot.

435
01:10:04,743 --> 01:10:06,701
Thank you.

436
01:10:15,554 --> 01:10:17,386
Now we are real friends indeed.

437
01:10:19,157 --> 01:10:20,227
Friend.

438
01:10:51,427 --> 01:10:52,338
Don't move.

439
01:10:52,428 --> 01:10:53,020
Don't fight back.

440
01:10:53,109 --> 01:10:53,939
Freeze.

441
01:10:57,032 --> 01:10:57,863
They have guns.

442
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:05,951
Hurry.

443
01:11:20,454 --> 01:11:22,208
Faster.

444
01:11:23,377 --> 01:11:24,777
Hurry.

445
01:11:25,219 --> 01:11:26,812
Block the front.

446
01:11:29,703 --> 01:11:30,819
Stop.

447
01:11:30,904 --> 01:11:31,894
This is my room.

448
01:11:32,225 --> 01:11:32,624
I am an American.

449
01:11:33,466 --> 01:11:34,821
Get out of here.

450
01:11:36,469 --> 01:11:37,789
Go inside.

451
01:11:46,639 --> 01:11:47,914
Get the woman out of here.

452
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,073
Go away.

453
01:11:53,085 --> 01:11:54,075
Shut up.

454
01:11:57,649 --> 01:11:59,243
What do you want?

455
01:11:59,851 --> 01:12:01,844
The Imperial Army wants to inspect this room.

456
01:12:02,013 --> 01:12:03,607
Please open the door.

457
01:12:17,267 --> 01:12:19,100
Is it a Chinese animal?

458
01:12:21,191 --> 01:12:21,863
Yes.

459
01:12:23,673 --> 01:12:25,028
I have seen it before.

460
01:12:52,220 --> 01:12:53,290
Yours?

461
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:06,873
I study in church school.

462
01:13:09,076 --> 01:13:09,873
Give me?

463
01:13:20,166 --> 01:13:21,316
Thank you.

464
01:13:31,177 --> 01:13:32,611
So many people.

465
01:13:34,139 --> 01:13:35,289
Friend.

466
01:13:36,742 --> 01:13:39,383
Friend.

467
01:13:39,865 --> 01:13:41,458
Don't be afraid.

468
01:13:42,067 --> 01:13:43,387
Don't be nervous.

469
01:13:44,709 --> 01:13:45,904
The Imperial Army is actually here

470
01:13:46,391 --> 01:13:47,905
to borrow a few women

471
01:13:48,433 --> 01:13:49,263
to entertain them.

472
01:13:49,354 --> 01:13:50,504
They will be returned in three days.

473
01:13:51,636 --> 01:13:52,547
That's not right.

474
01:13:53,317 --> 01:13:54,353
Women can't be borrowed.

475
01:13:54,879 --> 01:13:55,595
Who are you?

476
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,237
Mr. Rabe's secretary.

477
01:13:59,083 --> 01:14:00,517
He's Mr Rabe's secretary.

478
01:14:01,445 --> 01:14:02,356
Get out of my way.

479
01:14:07,851 --> 01:14:08,841
We are partners.

480
01:14:12,175 --> 01:14:13,052
That's my wife and her sister.

481
01:14:14,897 --> 01:14:18,257
You must keep your promise.

482
01:14:20,102 --> 01:14:20,933
Mr. Tang.

483
01:14:20,983 --> 01:14:23,055
Don't pull me.

484
01:14:40,001 --> 01:14:41,401
Mommy.

485
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:50,601
Mr. Tang.

486
01:15:03,623 --> 01:15:05,820
Sister.

487
01:15:31,249 --> 01:15:33,811
He went to the Safety Zone.

488
01:15:35,453 --> 01:15:41,294
He saw women with curly hair
and eyebrows lipsticks.

489
01:15:41,338 --> 01:15:43,137
He knew they were prostitutes.

490
01:15:46,623 --> 01:15:47,659
In Japan,

491
01:15:49,466 --> 01:15:53,509
any women with curly hair and
lipstick are prostitutes?

492
01:15:56,993 --> 01:16:02,072
She asked if any women in Japan with
curly hair and lipstick are prostitutes.

493
01:16:02,838 --> 01:16:04,034
And if we refuse?

494
01:16:16,611 --> 01:16:18,808
If you refuse

495
01:16:18,853 --> 01:16:22,406
they will send troops to destroy
the Safety Zone.

496
01:16:25,179 --> 01:16:27,980
It only took three days to conquer Nanking.

497
01:16:33,107 --> 01:16:34,939
It won't take an hour to destroy here.

498
01:16:36,950 --> 01:16:37,986
You know their power.

499
01:16:38,952 --> 01:16:40,147
You have no choice.

500
01:16:41,675 --> 01:16:43,668
China lost the war.

501
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:50,081
Nanking is no more the capital.

502
01:16:55,488 --> 01:17:03,083
Your people told him that there
are soldiers with weapons.

503
01:17:08,540 --> 01:17:10,772
That's a very big problem.

504
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:51,930
Today,

505
01:17:53,782 --> 01:17:55,102
one hundred of you

506
01:17:58,266 --> 01:17:59,747
will be leaving us.

507
01:18:00,869 --> 01:18:02,349
I'm so sorry.

508
01:18:06,274 --> 01:18:07,151
Today,

509
01:18:08,236 --> 01:18:10,468
one hundred women will be leaving us.

510
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,198
The Japanese have threatened us that

511
01:18:15,082 --> 01:18:16,562
if we don't hand over... -

512
01:18:18,565 --> 01:18:20,364
hand over one hundred women,

513
01:18:21,048 --> 01:18:22,368
they will destroy the refugee camp.

514
01:18:24,491 --> 01:18:28,203
The women will be required to... -

515
01:18:32,218 --> 01:18:36,693
they will be required to give
comfort to Japanese soldiers.

516
01:18:36,943 --> 01:18:38,821
All Nanking women are here.

517
01:18:40,466 --> 01:18:41,502
Great.

518
01:18:42,868 --> 01:18:44,063
The Japanese said,

519
01:18:45,631 --> 01:18:48,990
you would be returned in three weeks.

520
01:18:50,836 --> 01:18:51,825
In return of your sacrifice,

521
01:18:55,320 --> 01:18:56,549
they will supply the camp

522
01:18:57,522 --> 01:19:03,477
with food, clothes and coal for the winter.

523
01:19:05,649 --> 01:19:06,879
That means

524
01:19:08,092 --> 01:19:11,451
our children will make it through the winter.

525
01:19:14,818 --> 01:19:19,100
I am so sorry.

526
01:19:41,203 --> 01:19:42,432
Mr. Rabe.

527
01:19:47,569 --> 01:19:49,162
I'll go.

528
01:19:51,893 --> 01:19:55,093
Please come to the front.

529
01:20:23,963 --> 01:20:25,477
I'll go.

530
01:20:51,989 --> 01:20:52,740
I'll go.

531
01:21:44,598 --> 01:21:45,748
That's enough.

532
01:22:00,173 --> 01:22:06,698
Senior soldiers shall have priority.

533
01:22:07,820 --> 01:22:12,693
Pay first before getting a condom

534
01:22:13,665 --> 01:22:16,182
to prevent VD infection.

535
01:22:17,269 --> 01:22:23,429
5 dollars for Japanese girls,
2 for Chinese or Korean.

536
01:22:24,796 --> 01:22:28,712
Each person shall have 15 minutes.

537
01:22:35,566 --> 01:22:36,443
Rice?

538
01:22:55,865 --> 01:22:56,502
Give me a smile.

539
01:22:58,227 --> 01:22:58,819
Smile.

540
01:23:01,430 --> 01:23:01,987
Smile.

541
01:23:07,315 --> 01:23:08,670
Yuriko, why are you here?

542
01:23:15,883 --> 01:23:17,113
Sorry.

543
01:23:35,061 --> 01:23:36,257
Kadokawa.

544
01:23:40,386 --> 01:23:40,944
Kadokawa.

545
01:23:43,029 --> 01:23:43,860
Are you finished?

546
01:23:47,193 --> 01:23:47,943
Thank you.

547
01:23:59,965 --> 01:24:02,162
You are too noisy.

548
01:24:03,208 --> 01:24:04,119
But it feels good.

549
01:24:30,193 --> 01:24:31,913
Sir, the food supply report.
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

550
01:24:32,835 --> 01:24:34,065
Mr. Tomita, the pass... -

551
01:24:34,477 --> 01:24:35,433
Not now.

552
01:24:35,518 --> 01:24:36,793
You just need to sign it.

553
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:38,316
Is it Mr. Tomita?

554
01:24:38,681 --> 01:24:40,594
We've finally arrived.

555
01:24:40,643 --> 01:24:41,759
Was it a rough trip?

556
01:24:41,804 --> 01:24:43,397
How can we visit Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum?

557
01:24:43,926 --> 01:24:44,643
Come.

558
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:46,324
Could we have a car?

559
01:24:46,368 --> 01:24:47,404
Sure.

560
01:24:47,489 --> 01:24:48,047
He will organize it.

561
01:24:48,850 --> 01:24:51,890
This is Mr. Tang's sister-in-law.

562
01:24:52,013 --> 01:24:53,163
She also was taken.

563
01:24:54,696 --> 01:24:58,534
We must... Please help us find her.

564
01:25:01,462 --> 01:25:05,698
Mr. Tang's daughter was killed yesterday.

565
01:25:15,195 --> 01:25:15,992
I'm very sorry.

566
01:25:20,360 --> 01:25:23,753
I call you.

567
01:25:24,284 --> 01:25:27,084
You answer me.

568
01:25:27,607 --> 01:25:30,521
Sounds like echoes from the valley.

569
01:25:31,530 --> 01:25:33,523
So happy.

570
01:25:35,254 --> 01:25:36,324
You.

571
01:25:37,016 --> 01:25:38,370
What?

572
01:25:39,378 --> 01:25:42,019
The sky is so blue.

573
01:25:42,541 --> 01:25:45,057
Two young people.

574
01:27:59,028 --> 01:27:59,859
Kadokawa.

575
01:28:15,484 --> 01:28:16,554
She was so beautiful.

576
01:28:23,892 --> 01:28:25,690
She's better off dead than living like this.

577
01:28:58,764 --> 01:29:00,084
I want to go back to Japan.

578
01:29:51,373 --> 01:29:52,694
Have you found May?

579
01:29:53,896 --> 01:29:55,729
May hasn't returned.

580
01:30:27,567 --> 01:30:30,084
Mr. Rabe.

581
01:30:32,612 --> 01:30:34,491
Mr. Rabe, you can't leave.

582
01:30:56,234 --> 01:30:57,509
Goodbye, my friends.

583
01:30:59,157 --> 01:31:00,147
Take care.

584
01:31:05,363 --> 01:31:07,241
Mr. Rabe, your luggage.

585
01:32:43,935 --> 01:32:46,212
Your car can't go beyond this place.

586
01:32:46,537 --> 01:32:47,813
Take their luggage down.

587
01:32:55,225 --> 01:32:58,459
We have someone move the luggage for you.

588
01:32:59,309 --> 01:33:00,220
Of course.

589
01:33:05,435 --> 01:33:08,714
Please can you get both my assistants through?

590
01:33:10,039 --> 01:33:11,599
I'll try.

591
01:33:11,681 --> 01:33:12,831
Please.

592
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:28,486
Long time no see.

593
01:33:30,138 --> 01:33:31,208
How are you?

594
01:33:42,069 --> 01:33:43,709
Your wife is very beautiful.

595
01:33:50,677 --> 01:33:55,153
Mr. Rabe may only take one assistant
and a family member with him.

596
01:33:56,202 --> 01:33:58,160
I know.

597
01:33:59,606 --> 01:34:01,838
Go.

598
01:34:49,332 --> 01:34:51,006
I'll stay.

599
01:34:51,294 --> 01:34:53,935
I'll look for May.

600
01:35:49,228 --> 01:35:50,822
Go back.

601
01:35:51,270 --> 01:35:53,581
Mr. Rabe can only take one assistant.

602
01:35:54,193 --> 01:35:55,786
What are you doing?

603
01:36:07,886 --> 01:36:12,281
It's good to live.

604
01:36:16,934 --> 01:36:19,531
I'll stay. Let him go.

605
01:36:21,378 --> 01:36:22,779
He says,

606
01:36:23,460 --> 01:36:25,134
he has made his decision.

607
01:36:40,316 --> 01:36:41,591
Go.

608
01:37:14,428 --> 01:37:15,828
Don't worry.

609
01:37:16,950 --> 01:37:20,833
I'll keep on sending you my salary on time.

610
01:37:41,333 --> 01:37:44,009
Stay safe. I'll wait for you.

611
01:37:56,627 --> 01:37:58,824
Please take care of my wife.

612
01:38:46,514 --> 01:38:49,429
Halt.

613
01:38:50,438 --> 01:38:51,269
Turn right.

614
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:53,676
Gun down.

615
01:38:55,563 --> 01:38:57,043
Attention.

616
01:38:58,445 --> 01:39:00,039
Aim.

617
01:39:03,490 --> 01:39:04,480
Fire.

618
01:39:06,533 --> 01:39:08,331
Reload.

619
01:39:12,418 --> 01:39:14,058
Everyone dies in the end.

620
01:39:17,903 --> 01:39:20,295
This is a beautiful place.

621
01:39:53,016 --> 01:39:54,291
You know what?

622
01:39:56,019 --> 01:39:57,818
My wife is pregnant again.

623
01:40:01,744 --> 01:40:03,816
My wife is pregnant again.

624
01:40:43,383 --> 01:40:45,182
Aim.

625
01:40:50,470 --> 01:40:52,144
Fire.

626
01:41:10,689 --> 01:41:12,009
Stand straight.

627
01:41:12,731 --> 01:41:14,131
Turn right.

628
01:41:15,173 --> 01:41:16,813
Fall out.

629
01:41:53,609 --> 01:42:01,615
All woman and children over here.

630
01:42:02,097 --> 01:42:06,458
Woman and children stand over here.

631
01:42:09,224 --> 01:42:11,615
Women get over here.

632
01:42:11,666 --> 01:42:13,100
You too.

633
01:42:13,548 --> 01:42:15,380
Listen carefully.

634
01:42:15,830 --> 01:42:17,902
If you're a Chinese soldier,

635
01:42:18,392 --> 01:42:19,713
quickly step forward.

636
01:42:21,075 --> 01:42:23,716
If you don't and we find you,

637
01:42:24,038 --> 01:42:25,518
you'll be executed.

638
01:42:26,160 --> 01:42:27,753
If you give yourself up,

639
01:42:28,041 --> 01:42:30,034
the Imperial Army will guarantee your life.

640
01:42:30,524 --> 01:42:33,086
We'll give you work, food,

641
01:42:33,606 --> 01:42:34,802
and even money.

642
01:42:35,248 --> 01:42:36,204
Two cents per day.

643
01:42:36,890 --> 01:42:38,483
If you don't surrender,

644
01:42:39,172 --> 01:42:40,811
once discovered,

645
01:42:40,893 --> 01:42:42,647
you'll be executed.

646
01:42:42,695 --> 01:42:43,367
Next row.

647
01:42:43,416 --> 01:42:45,409
Understood?

648
01:42:45,658 --> 01:42:46,694
Step forward.

649
01:42:51,663 --> 01:42:52,619
Next row.

650
01:42:55,387 --> 01:42:56,707
Step forward.

651
01:43:01,833 --> 01:43:02,869
Next row.

652
01:43:05,957 --> 01:43:06,469
Take him away.

653
01:43:09,240 --> 01:43:10,037
You come here.

654
01:43:13,684 --> 01:43:15,084
Kid, go away.

655
01:43:16,647 --> 01:43:17,444
Next.

656
01:43:22,012 --> 01:43:22,603
Faster.

657
01:43:27,657 --> 01:43:28,534
Faster.

658
01:43:46,315 --> 01:43:46,713
You.

659
01:43:48,156 --> 01:43:49,146
Let me take a look.

660
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:52,751
Come with me.

661
01:43:59,927 --> 01:44:01,156
Take him away.

662
01:44:03,811 --> 01:44:04,402
Go.

663
01:44:07,454 --> 01:44:08,126
Go.

664
01:44:09,656 --> 01:44:10,248
Miss Jiang.

665
01:44:10,898 --> 01:44:11,569
Save me.

666
01:44:12,619 --> 01:44:13,450
Miss Jiang.

667
01:44:14,141 --> 01:44:14,857
Get back to your spot.

668
01:44:15,222 --> 01:44:16,372
Miss Jiang, you must save me.

669
01:44:17,824 --> 01:44:18,541
Shut up.

670
01:44:19,065 --> 01:44:19,896
Save me.

671
01:44:21,588 --> 01:44:23,068
Miss Jiang, save me.

672
01:44:33,919 --> 01:44:35,513
Take her back.

673
01:44:36,562 --> 01:44:38,076
Shut up.

674
01:44:40,645 --> 01:44:41,556
Stand back.

675
01:44:42,847 --> 01:44:44,919
Please talk to the commander.

676
01:44:49,614 --> 01:44:51,048
Just talk with him.

677
01:44:55,219 --> 01:44:58,055
Let the foreigners come forward.

678
01:45:05,629 --> 01:45:07,143
You are Chinese.

679
01:45:10,353 --> 01:45:11,309
Don't push.

680
01:45:16,359 --> 01:45:18,875
Miss Vautrin will work out a solution.

681
01:45:18,921 --> 01:45:20,196
Don't worry.

682
01:45:22,525 --> 01:45:23,800
They won't let them go.

683
01:45:27,569 --> 01:45:29,129
We would not be afraid of the enemies.

684
01:45:29,171 --> 01:45:29,683
I am not afraid.

685
01:45:29,731 --> 01:45:31,006
We are strong.

686
01:45:31,693 --> 01:45:32,843
Could you give them a moment?

687
01:45:34,936 --> 01:45:40,174
Sir, we ask you to listen to
the pleas of these women,

688
01:45:40,221 --> 01:45:42,214
for their husbands, their sons.

689
01:45:42,263 --> 01:45:43,856
They are civilians.

690
01:45:43,905 --> 01:45:47,264
My staff member is on that truck.
He is not a soldier.

691
01:45:47,308 --> 01:45:48,662
Please release them.

692
01:45:58,558 --> 01:46:00,357
Mizukami, Furuta.

693
01:46:02,842 --> 01:46:04,162
Miss Jiang.

694
01:46:04,204 --> 01:46:05,479
Good news.

695
01:46:07,647 --> 01:46:11,006
Those with family can go get them.

696
01:46:11,050 --> 01:46:13,361
Understood.

697
01:46:16,655 --> 01:46:18,932
But each one can save just one.

698
01:46:19,578 --> 01:46:20,932
Just one.

699
01:46:26,624 --> 01:46:27,501
Listen to me.

700
01:46:29,387 --> 01:46:32,109
If your family is on those trucks,

701
01:46:32,790 --> 01:46:34,589
you can go and bring them back.

702
01:46:34,632 --> 01:46:35,224
Miss Jiang.

703
01:46:37,274 --> 01:46:38,425
Now go and bring them back.

704
01:46:40,157 --> 01:46:40,874
Aren't there too many?

705
01:46:58,214 --> 01:46:59,534
Miss Jiang, save me.

706
01:47:02,178 --> 01:47:03,407
Miss Jiang, save me.

707
01:47:05,781 --> 01:47:06,498
Mr. Chen.

708
01:47:07,262 --> 01:47:08,059
Mr. Chen.

709
01:47:09,104 --> 01:47:09,821
My husband.

710
01:47:10,706 --> 01:47:11,456
This one?

711
01:47:13,709 --> 01:47:14,300
Get down.

712
01:47:16,992 --> 01:47:17,982
Miss Jiang.

713
01:47:20,675 --> 01:47:21,665
Miss Jiang, save me.

714
01:47:27,962 --> 01:47:30,114
Miss Jiang, thank you for saving me.

715
01:47:31,365 --> 01:47:32,845
Thank you so much.

716
01:47:33,407 --> 01:47:33,839
It's all right.

717
01:47:34,488 --> 01:47:35,045
You'll be safe.

718
01:47:35,209 --> 01:47:36,199
Get down.

719
01:47:37,491 --> 01:47:37,889
Mom.

720
01:47:39,172 --> 01:47:40,049
Dad is over there.

721
01:47:42,576 --> 01:47:42,928
Dad.

722
01:47:44,898 --> 01:47:46,127
You can only claim one person.

723
01:47:46,499 --> 01:47:48,492
Please, I am begging you. He is my man.

724
01:47:50,663 --> 01:47:51,574
Go back.

725
01:47:54,587 --> 01:47:56,385
Just one.

726
01:47:57,509 --> 01:47:58,739
Dad.

727
01:47:59,712 --> 01:48:00,782
Hurry.

728
01:48:03,956 --> 01:48:06,027
Miss Jiang, please.

729
01:48:06,678 --> 01:48:09,069
Miss Jiang, please save my father.

730
01:48:09,841 --> 01:48:11,435
We have a family to raise.

731
01:48:11,883 --> 01:48:12,999
Do you understand?

732
01:48:19,250 --> 01:48:20,570
Those who claim more than one will be shot.

733
01:48:21,612 --> 01:48:22,363
Attention.

734
01:48:22,973 --> 01:48:23,611
Each person can only claim one person.

735
01:48:23,774 --> 01:48:24,651
Miss Jiang.

736
01:48:25,215 --> 01:48:26,171
Xiaodou.

737
01:48:33,303 --> 01:48:34,419
Don't push.

738
01:48:34,544 --> 01:48:35,455
Xiaodou.

739
01:48:40,630 --> 01:48:42,189
Kid, go away.

740
01:48:46,475 --> 01:48:47,750
Xiaodou.

741
01:49:05,573 --> 01:49:06,563
Sergeant.

742
01:49:08,176 --> 01:49:09,496
That woman is very suspicious.

743
01:49:14,662 --> 01:49:15,937
Miss Jiang.

744
01:49:20,507 --> 01:49:21,543
Zhao.

745
01:49:22,229 --> 01:49:22,900
My husband.

746
01:49:25,071 --> 01:49:25,948
Get down.

747
01:49:25,992 --> 01:49:26,709
Dad.

748
01:49:27,754 --> 01:49:28,824
Thank you, Miss Jiang.

749
01:49:29,516 --> 01:49:30,916
Thank you, Xiaodou.

750
01:49:32,719 --> 01:49:33,515
Stop.

751
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:35,311
Come here.

752
01:49:35,361 --> 01:49:36,238
Xiaodou.

753
01:49:40,686 --> 01:49:42,644
You are a soldier. Come here.

754
01:49:50,455 --> 01:49:51,889
You again.

755
01:49:56,621 --> 01:49:58,898
Mr. Rabe can't save you anymore.

756
01:50:01,065 --> 01:50:02,864
Our people will be very pleased.

757
01:50:08,472 --> 01:50:09,223
Take her away.

758
01:50:16,640 --> 01:50:17,869
Shoot me.

759
01:51:18,337 --> 01:51:19,487
Kadokawa.

760
01:52:05,662 --> 01:52:06,572
Is Yuriko here?

761
01:52:07,263 --> 01:52:09,733
She followed the troops to the
frontline and died there.

762
01:52:22,838 --> 01:52:27,757
Help me build her a grave.

763
01:52:29,844 --> 01:52:31,598
She was once my wife.

764
01:52:34,208 --> 01:52:35,278
Yuriko

765
01:52:36,370 --> 01:52:38,283
was once my wife.

766
01:53:46,356 --> 01:53:47,506
Stand up.

767
01:54:21,869 --> 01:54:23,463
Go.

768
01:59:00,370 --> 01:59:01,645
Stop.

769
01:59:04,133 --> 01:59:05,283
Untie them.

770
01:59:17,986 --> 01:59:18,737
Go.

771
01:59:30,838 --> 01:59:31,749
Go.

772
01:59:56,262 --> 02:00:00,862
Life is more difficult than death.

773
02:00:47,670 --> 02:00:48,547
Kadokawa.

774
02:04:42,890 --> 02:04:52,775
THE END
