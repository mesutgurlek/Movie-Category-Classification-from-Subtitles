1
00:00:02,793 --> 00:00:04,794
<i>Previously on X Company...</i>

2
00:00:04,828 --> 00:00:07,797
I don't understand being
afraid to kill those people.

3
00:00:07,831 --> 00:00:09,966
I don't understand anyone who is.

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,468
How did the Germans
know to attack our camp?

5
00:00:12,502 --> 00:00:14,770
We're down to just us.
Plus George, Miri, and Conrad.

6
00:00:14,805 --> 00:00:16,605
- And Aurora?
- Aurora left us.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,060
You don't know what she's been through.

8
00:00:18,139 --> 00:00:19,960
Something you'd care to share?

9
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,321
- My name is not Helene.
- She's a spy.

10
00:00:22,374 --> 00:00:23,377
You know her?

11
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:27,817
My husband, who died?
He beat him. Starved him.

12
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,285
We were at war!

13
00:00:29,319 --> 00:00:32,088
- Both of you!
- If I don't report back

14
00:00:32,122 --> 00:00:34,156
to my cell within the next few hours,

15
00:00:34,191 --> 00:00:37,856
they will deliver anonymous photographs
of your wife and me to your superiors.

16
00:00:38,687 --> 00:00:41,130
That's why I know you will

17
00:00:41,164 --> 00:00:43,242
let me walk off this train.

18
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:44,232
Sabine.

19
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,161

20
00:00:47,517 --> 00:00:49,113
_

21
00:00:51,118 --> 00:00:52,575
She's not coming, is she?

22
00:00:52,609 --> 00:00:55,444
- What aren't you telling us?
- She killed Rene.

23
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:57,437
All this time, she was lying to us?

24
00:00:57,503 --> 00:01:00,850
I think she killed him
so he wouldn't suffer.

25
00:01:00,884 --> 00:01:03,753
- Klaus! Stop!
- Klaus,

26
00:01:03,787 --> 00:01:06,843
I meant what I said before, son.
So did I.

27
00:01:06,949 --> 00:01:09,199
Krystina. (gunshot)

28
00:01:10,327 --> 00:01:12,630
I know what he meant to you.

29
00:01:14,305 --> 00:01:15,998
Get everyone ready.

30
00:01:16,033 --> 00:01:18,334
The attack on Dieppe is tonight.

31
00:01:18,368 --> 00:01:21,121
S02E09
Butcher and Bolt

32
00:01:21,318 --> 00:01:24,287
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

33
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,540
Here.

34
00:01:57,574 --> 00:01:58,553
Pour-De-Lys?

35
00:01:58,616 --> 00:02:00,716
In a few hours when the troops
hit the beach

36
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:03,848
we take advantage of the
distraction and go after FREYA.

37
00:02:03,941 --> 00:02:05,154
- FREYA?
- Who's she?

38
00:02:05,247 --> 00:02:08,017
No, it's not a she.
It's German long-range radar.

39
00:02:08,354 --> 00:02:10,086
I got a crash course back at the Camp.

40
00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:12,088
- But why...
- Well, their radar beats

41
00:02:12,122 --> 00:02:14,462
the pants off ours.
It sees much clearer,

42
00:02:14,621 --> 00:02:16,006
much farther.

43
00:02:16,309 --> 00:02:18,249
They want us to get inside
the installation,

44
00:02:18,354 --> 00:02:20,088
photograph everything we can,

45
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,232
then blow it up.
Make it look like an air strike.

46
00:02:23,266 --> 00:02:25,601
- No survivors.
- So they don't know

47
00:02:25,635 --> 00:02:28,604
that we just got a window
inside their radar secrets.

48
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:30,739
So we can develop counter-
measures behind their backs.

49
00:02:30,774 --> 00:02:32,675
If we can cripple a
major radar station...

50
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:35,244
It'll be a huge help to the
boys landing on the beach.

51
00:02:35,278 --> 00:02:37,546
- I like it.
- This radar station's gonna be

52
00:02:37,581 --> 00:02:39,615
heavily fortified.

53
00:02:39,649 --> 00:02:41,951
So when you say "get inside"...

54
00:02:41,985 --> 00:02:43,953
That's what our guerrilla army was for.

55
00:02:43,987 --> 00:02:45,988
Which we don't have anymore.
(doors clanging)

56
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:54,199
- You're late.
- I, um...

57
00:02:54,265 --> 00:02:56,432
had to take care of something.

58
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,189
I came as fast as I could.

59
00:02:59,803 --> 00:03:01,616
What'd I miss?

60
00:03:31,447 --> 00:03:34,069
Sir? Minesweepers have finished

61
00:03:34,104 --> 00:03:36,305
in the Channel,
and the Canadians have departed

62
00:03:36,339 --> 00:03:39,141
- Newhaven port. All on schedule.
- Were you able to sleep?

63
00:03:39,692 --> 00:03:41,737
It doesn't matter. Working will help.

64
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:43,901
- Understood.
- You?

65
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:47,740
- Working will help. Clock?
- Plus 37 minutes.

66
00:03:47,845 --> 00:03:50,141
- First landing?
- 04:50.

67
00:03:50,629 --> 00:03:52,321
Everything today is in real time.
I need you

68
00:03:52,355 --> 00:03:54,290
- on top of those relays.
- Yes, sir.

69
00:03:54,324 --> 00:03:56,158
- Colonel.
- Welcome back.

70
00:03:56,193 --> 00:03:59,072
- Any word on my request?
- Seconding a squad of soldiers

71
00:03:59,178 --> 00:04:01,697
for a side mission right
before an attack does

72
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:04,133
- raise certain questions.
- My team lost half their men.

73
00:04:04,167 --> 00:04:06,936
We need to give them a fighting chance.

74
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,072
A detachment of 14 Royal Winnipeg Sabers

75
00:04:10,106 --> 00:04:13,042
from Green Beach will peel
off as the main force engages.

76
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:16,378
They have coordinates to
rendezvous with your people.

77
00:04:16,413 --> 00:04:18,505
- They don't know anything more.
- What did you say

78
00:04:18,571 --> 00:04:20,339
to make it happen? I told them I had

79
00:04:20,418 --> 00:04:24,486
a very tenacious Canadian on my
back and he wouldn't climb off.

80
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:26,622
They were remarkably sympathetic.

81
00:04:38,826 --> 00:04:40,831
- Jacob too?
- Gone! Don't change subjects!

82
00:04:40,924 --> 00:04:41,755
Harry, let her speak.

83
00:04:41,838 --> 00:04:44,194
It's beyond reckless, Aurora.
What the hell were you thinking?

84
00:04:44,273 --> 00:04:47,176
I was thinking...
how often do you get the wife

85
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:49,645
of a Gestapo boss this vulnerable?

86
00:04:49,679 --> 00:04:52,109
This close to turning against Germany?

87
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:53,882
I steered her to a train going

88
00:04:53,917 --> 00:04:56,151
toward the coast...
yeah, to spend more time with her

89
00:04:56,186 --> 00:04:58,153
but also to be here by tonight.

90
00:04:58,188 --> 00:05:00,422
And then when Faber showed up, which,

91
00:05:00,457 --> 00:05:04,193
obviously, I hadn't planned for,
well, I made the most of it.

92
00:05:04,227 --> 00:05:06,295
- What did that look like?
- I told him everything

93
00:05:06,329 --> 00:05:08,364
we'd discovered thanks to his wife.

94
00:05:08,398 --> 00:05:11,000
I saw his fear. His need to protect her.

95
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:13,335
Your big discovery is
that Faber loves his wife?

96
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:16,344
Enough to lower his weapon
and let me walk away, yeah.

97
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:18,309
And maybe more. What are you saying?

98
00:05:18,402 --> 00:05:21,383
I'm saying maybe he'll work with us.

99
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,040
- Come on.
- That's a hell of a leap.

100
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:28,391
So what, you're guessing about Faber?
Meanwhile, we get massacred

101
00:05:28,444 --> 00:05:30,422
in the woods. Where were you?

102
00:05:30,475 --> 00:05:31,597
There's no way I
could have known, Harry.

103
00:05:31,676 --> 00:05:33,167
We got orders we've waited on

104
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:35,422
for weeks. Where were you?

105
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:36,471
I was on my way here.

106
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:39,395
There was an attack at Camp X yesterday.
A bomb was brought into Hydra.

107
00:05:39,429 --> 00:05:41,339
- What?
- We were able to radio them

108
00:05:41,392 --> 00:05:44,700
to alert them in time so no harm.
But again, where were you?

109
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:48,570
We were only able to warn the Camp
because of what we saw in Faber's safe,

110
00:05:48,605 --> 00:05:50,204
- which wouldn't have happened...
- We're going into...

111
00:05:50,296 --> 00:05:53,119
- have happened without her.
- We're going into a war zone.

112
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:55,911
And we don't have a leader.

113
00:05:58,014 --> 00:06:00,249
Sinclair trusted Alfred
with this operation,

114
00:06:00,283 --> 00:06:02,862
so I think Alfred should lead us.

115
00:06:06,081 --> 00:06:08,931
And I bet I'm not the
only one who thinks so.

116
00:06:14,392 --> 00:06:16,625
Chain of command never
stopped you before, Harry.

117
00:06:20,622 --> 00:06:22,588
You want me replaced?

118
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:25,841
Do it.

119
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:30,126

00:07:33,443 --> 00:07:35,377
- What?
- We're not voting.

138
00:07:35,736 --> 00:07:37,880
There will be thousands of men

139
00:07:37,914 --> 00:07:41,750
on that beach today with much
bigger problems than ours.

140
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:44,520
You picked a hell of a day for a mutiny.

141
00:07:44,554 --> 00:07:46,725
Mutiny? Really?

142
00:07:46,949 --> 00:07:50,119
How about "desertion"?
Or "breach of trust"?

143
00:07:51,227 --> 00:07:53,862
- What are you talking about?
- You killed Rene!

144
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:56,031
You told no one

145
00:07:56,065 --> 00:07:57,705
except the enemy.

146
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,604
So how do you expect us to trust
a single thing that you say?

147
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:08,130
Over here!

148
00:08:09,884 --> 00:08:12,648
We sent them to Sinclair's dead drop.

149
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,413
Let's see what they left us.

150
00:08:23,437 --> 00:08:24,193
Wow.

151
00:08:24,227 --> 00:08:27,596
We're practically a second Front.
What's that for?

152
00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:30,399
That's for me.

153
00:08:31,943 --> 00:08:33,724
I'm not leading you.

154
00:08:34,186 --> 00:08:35,875
I'm not even going with you.

155
00:08:36,798 --> 00:08:40,909
You need to figure things out,
so we can do what we came for.

156
00:08:56,679 --> 00:08:58,275
What I did,

157
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:01,270
Rene begged me to do it.

158
00:09:04,067 --> 00:09:05,623
I had no choice.

159
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:10,338
Check your supplies and
say what you have to say.

160
00:09:11,472 --> 00:09:13,174
I'll be back in five minutes.

161
00:09:22,966 --> 00:09:24,734
Where are you going?

162
00:09:24,813 --> 00:09:27,322
Or is that "need-to-know"?

163
00:09:27,979 --> 00:09:30,526
The Hotel Dieppe.

164
00:09:31,014 --> 00:09:32,728
The Naval Headquarters? But...

165
00:09:32,762 --> 00:09:35,472
that's Wehrmacht, not Gestapo.

166
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:38,520
Your orders?

167
00:09:39,047 --> 00:09:42,293
I'm going in with an urgent
message about the Allied attack.

168
00:09:44,311 --> 00:09:46,842
A message they'll need to pass along

169
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:49,378
to their Uboat Wolfpacks.

170
00:09:49,412 --> 00:09:50,713
You're going through a lot of trouble

171
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:55,120
- to send a little misinformation.
- Unless you want to watch them

172
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:57,452
send the message out?
If I can get close enough,

173
00:09:57,487 --> 00:10:01,413
I can memorize the settings,
the markings on the machine,

174
00:10:01,572 --> 00:10:03,841
- how it operates.
- So it's true.

175
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:10,198
The Germans have

176
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:13,084
an unbreakable code machine.

177
00:10:13,756 --> 00:10:16,685
And you're going to walk out
with a chance to break it.

178
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:19,541
Going to try.

179
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:22,859
Alfred, that's brilliant!

180
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:30,319
There's a place outside London.

181
00:10:31,558 --> 00:10:33,774
All the top codebreakers.

182
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,826
What I'll learn is too classified

183
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,495
to send by radio or courier.

184
00:10:44,334 --> 00:10:46,468
You're not coming back.

185
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:48,472
I'm leaving with the troops.

186
00:10:49,872 --> 00:10:51,802
I'll be there by morning.

187
00:10:58,266 --> 00:11:00,060
You know? It works.

188
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:02,327
When you lead.

189
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:06,612
Everything's muddy now,
but they're going to need you.

190
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:10,035
Not just today, after too.

191
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:12,237
I'm not sure they want me to lead.

192
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,164
I had to tell them about Rene.

193
00:11:16,269 --> 00:11:18,669
- You had no right.
- I had every right.

194
00:11:18,814 --> 00:11:22,847
We have every right. We're a team.

195
00:11:24,672 --> 00:11:28,119
Why did you carry that alone?
Why didn't you tell us?

196
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,288
I just thought it'd be simpler

197
00:11:30,323 --> 00:11:31,612
to just...

198
00:11:31,744 --> 00:11:34,198
fight through it on my own,

199
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,768
focus on the work.

200
00:11:35,847 --> 00:11:38,288
Maybe if you hadn't closed yourself off,

201
00:11:38,354 --> 00:11:40,122
things would have been easier.

202
00:11:40,214 --> 00:11:42,219
Not when I'm supposed to lead a team.

203
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,718
It's not my job to feel.

204
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:49,441
We both know where that leads.

205
00:11:50,984 --> 00:11:53,078
You scared me...

206
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:55,747
when you didn't come back.

207
00:11:56,327 --> 00:11:58,183
I came back.

208
00:11:58,861 --> 00:12:00,813
Message from the Camp!

209
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:06,011
- We got help.
- Reinforcements.

210
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:08,755
- "To replace the men we lost.
- Thank you, Sinclair."

211
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:09,455
Who?

212
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,296
- How many?
- Fourteen men.

213
00:12:11,331 --> 00:12:13,432
A detachment from the
Royal Winnipeg Sabers.

214
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,434
They'll break off at Green beach,

215
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:17,936
and meet up with us here,

216
00:12:17,971 --> 00:12:20,141
before these fields,
just outside Pour-De-Lys.

217
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:21,935
So what's next?

218
00:12:28,754 --> 00:12:30,588
Like you said...

219
00:12:30,746 --> 00:12:33,305
there's going to be thousands
with bigger troubles.

220
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:38,224
Okay. You checked the explosives?

221
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:40,158
- Yeah, I just have to rig them up.
- Enough to make it

222
00:12:40,193 --> 00:12:42,394
- look like an air strike?
- Would be good to pull in

223
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,897
a mortar or two for show
once we're done, but yeah.

224
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:46,746
The more destruction the better.

225
00:12:46,865 --> 00:12:49,359
You don't have to tell me twice.

226
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,660
- I have to work on this.
- Yeah. What are we thinking?

227
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:56,174
If we can, uh, find a way

228
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:58,176
to come over the top,
we'd have surprise on our side.

229
00:12:58,211 --> 00:13:00,112
Overwhelm the Boche. You go in and do

230
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:02,288
your business, we stand watch.

231
00:13:03,132 --> 00:13:04,798
Respectfully, um...

232
00:13:06,012 --> 00:13:07,653
We're behind the lines, right? So,

233
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:10,233
the Germans will have their eyes
out front when the boats land.

234
00:13:10,392 --> 00:13:13,458
I think we should wait for
the reinforcements here,

235
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:16,528
then focus our attack from the rear.

236
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:20,165
That's a good idea. Let's do it. Conrad,

237
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,939
we can get eyes on
the harbour from here.

238
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:24,961
Now, you'll be our scout.

239
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:27,401
You've scouted the town, right?

240
00:13:27,494 --> 00:13:29,637
- I know my way around.
- And you can move

241
00:13:29,716 --> 00:13:33,245
- without being seen.
- People look past a gypsy.

242
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:37,975
I need you to be Alfred's spotter.

243
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:40,785
He needs to get safely
to the Hotel Dieppe.

244
00:13:42,808 --> 00:13:45,724
He knows where it is;
he has the map in his head.

245
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:48,507
- You need me with you.
- This is different.

246
00:13:48,837 --> 00:13:50,662
What he has to do today,

247
00:13:50,697 --> 00:13:53,065
what he's about to learn in there,

248
00:13:53,099 --> 00:13:55,200
it could turn into the
beginning of the end of the war.

249
00:13:56,024 --> 00:13:57,669
It makes him

250
00:13:57,704 --> 00:13:59,838
more important than any of us.

251
00:14:01,446 --> 00:14:03,623
He's that special, is he?

252
00:14:05,536 --> 00:14:06,912
Yes, he is.

253
00:14:08,888 --> 00:14:12,017
Don't worry. I'll take care of him.

254
00:14:12,885 --> 00:14:14,442
Thank you.

255

_

282
00:16:45,861 --> 00:16:47,827
What's her name?

283
00:16:49,265 --> 00:16:50,675
Fei Yen.

284
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,379
All right, no need to draw blood.
I won't pry.

285
00:17:01,569 --> 00:17:04,722
- I never did thank you.
- What for?

286
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:08,996
Kicking my ass when it needed kicking.
Dragging me

287
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,164
through the Paris streets.
Never giving up on me.

288
00:17:12,967 --> 00:17:15,475
You'd have done the same.
It was nothing.

289
00:17:15,778 --> 00:17:17,569
- Neil.
- Jesus, Tom.

290
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:19,571
Don't get soft on me now.
I was just getting used

291
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:22,574
to you with a backbone.
Finish your letter. Go on.

292
00:17:22,608 --> 00:17:24,630
Love and kisses.

293
00:17:37,067 --> 00:17:39,591
(bombs detonating nearby)

294
00:17:50,826 --> 00:17:52,435
This is it.

295
00:18:06,074 --> 00:18:07,380
It's starting.

296
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,559
Here we go.

297
00:18:14,847 --> 00:18:17,881
You take orders from Aurora
better than the others.

298
00:18:19,055 --> 00:18:20,932
Are you in love with her?

299
00:18:22,089 --> 00:18:24,102
Why are you asking that?

300
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:26,504
(sirens going off) Why don't you answer?

301
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:35,380
Stop!

302
00:18:46,322 --> 00:18:48,860
How do you know there's a
service tunnel into the HQ?

303
00:18:49,435 --> 00:18:51,096
It used to be a hotel.

304
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:54,963
I saw the floorplans.
Keep watch 10 minutes,

305
00:18:55,002 --> 00:18:57,769
- then get somewhere safe.
- No. I promised her

306
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,272
- I'd take care of you.
- I'll be fine.

307
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,412
She wants you safe.

308
00:19:02,663 --> 00:19:06,578
- I keep you safe.
- Okay.

309
00:19:21,268 --> 00:19:22,627
We should have seen them by now.

310
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,697
The reinforcements were
told to use this road.

311
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:28,233
It's too open. We're too exposed.

312
00:19:35,661 --> 00:19:37,509
The radar station's just ahead.

313
00:19:37,543 --> 00:19:40,345
Should we split up? Do an advance scout,
see what we're up against?

314
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:46,584
(large engine humming)

315
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,620
Bloody hell!

316
00:20:25,795 --> 00:20:28,676
They're defending the
approach to the station.

317
00:20:32,368 --> 00:20:34,992
Do you recognize the make?
Any weaknesses?

318
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,974
Yet another thing the Germans
build annoyingly well.

319
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:40,903
That level of armor,
anything less than heavy explosives...

320
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:43,570
Might as well be a pea shooter. Got it.

321
00:20:43,701 --> 00:20:44,712
Once our tanks push inland,

322
00:20:44,776 --> 00:20:46,412
the Germans'll scramble
everything to engage.

323
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:48,701
- Including this?
- Presumably.

324
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:50,548
Where the hell's Conrad?

325
00:20:50,654 --> 00:20:52,752
He should have had eyes
on the beach by now.

326
00:20:53,068 --> 00:20:54,942
(shots fired)

327
00:20:55,667 --> 00:20:57,901
- Could be worse.
- How's that?

328
00:20:57,993 --> 00:21:00,632
Could still be using stick guns.

329
00:21:20,374 --> 00:21:21,904
_

330
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:23,652
Ja!

331
00:21:24,127 --> 00:21:25,578
_

332
00:21:26,383 --> 00:21:27,544
_

333
00:21:27,663 --> 00:21:29,180
_

334
00:21:30,552 --> 00:21:32,913
_

335
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:35,143
_

336
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:37,285
_

337
00:21:38,314 --> 00:21:39,910
_

338
00:21:40,016 --> 00:21:42,272
_

339
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,934
_

340
00:21:44,079 --> 00:21:46,164
_

341
00:21:46,362 --> 00:21:48,472
_

342
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:49,980
_

343
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:52,395
_

344
00:21:52,527 --> 00:21:55,205
_

345
00:21:55,323 --> 00:21:57,250
_

346
00:21:57,513 --> 00:21:59,453
_

347
00:21:59,717 --> 00:22:02,527
_

348
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:05,433
_

349
00:22:05,987 --> 00:22:07,861
_

350
00:22:08,494 --> 00:22:12,240
Let's go! Move! Go!

351
00:22:12,386 --> 00:22:14,799
Go! Move. Stay inside.

352
00:22:14,878 --> 00:22:16,382
Move!

353
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,379
Move, move. Stay inside. Stay inside.

354
00:22:25,353 --> 00:22:26,909
Get inside.

355
00:22:27,015 --> 00:22:28,822
There's a sharpshooter in the church.

356
00:22:28,888 --> 00:22:31,593
- Shooting soldiers.
- Show me where!

357
00:22:32,384 --> 00:22:35,115
He went in there. In the tower.

358
00:22:35,392 --> 00:22:36,870
Up there!

359
00:23:32,298 --> 00:23:33,842
_

360
00:23:34,016 --> 00:23:38,670
_

361
00:23:39,277 --> 00:23:40,662
_

362
00:23:40,741 --> 00:23:42,747
_

363
00:23:42,958 --> 00:23:44,514
_

364
00:23:44,633 --> 00:23:46,506
(nearby explosion)

365
00:23:46,612 --> 00:23:48,202
_

366
00:23:48,783 --> 00:23:51,448
_

367
00:23:51,672 --> 00:23:53,110
_

368
00:23:53,202 --> 00:23:55,485
_

369
00:23:55,696 --> 00:23:59,561
_

370
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:01,930
_

371
00:24:02,471 --> 00:24:04,345
_

372
00:24:04,661 --> 00:24:05,492
_

373
00:24:05,624 --> 00:24:07,089
_

374
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:10,347
_

375
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:11,759
_

376
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:18,005
_

377
00:24:21,726 --> 00:24:22,979
_

378
00:24:47,288 --> 00:24:48,766
Get down! You saw the bloody tank.

379
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:51,287
It's a miracle they didn't see you.

380
00:24:52,596 --> 00:24:54,864
Did you get a view of the harbour?

381
00:24:55,530 --> 00:24:58,568
The tanks... they're dead on the beach,

382
00:24:58,973 --> 00:25:00,637
they're all breaking down.

383
00:25:00,671 --> 00:25:02,451
- Pebbles in the gears.
- Any sign

384
00:25:02,477 --> 00:25:05,327
- of our reinforcements?
- No one's getting through.

385
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:08,388
All up the beach,
it's a carpet of just...

386
00:25:09,469 --> 00:25:10,798
bodies.

387
00:25:11,365 --> 00:25:13,555
The water's gone red.

388
00:25:13,806 --> 00:25:15,285
My God.

389
00:25:17,473 --> 00:25:19,953
It's just a matter of
time before they call it.

390
00:25:20,138 --> 00:25:22,500
We're retreating? We just landed.

391
00:25:25,058 --> 00:25:27,182
All right. No reinforcements.

392
00:25:27,696 --> 00:25:30,229
- We take the station alone.
- What about the tank?

393
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:32,635
We could use the explosives.

394
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:35,405
- Do we have enough?
- To do any damage at all,

395
00:25:35,439 --> 00:25:38,624
we'd have to get underneath it.
I don't see that happening.

396
00:25:40,076 --> 00:25:41,830
We pick a man, take them down,

397
00:25:41,949 --> 00:25:43,680
- then worry about the tank.
- No. If we do that,

398
00:25:43,714 --> 00:25:45,933
there won't be enough of us
left to assault the station.

399
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:48,985
C'mon. Look. There's a way through this.
There always is.

400
00:25:49,019 --> 00:25:51,162
If that tank doesn't move, we're done.

401
00:25:51,254 --> 00:25:55,525
It'll move if it's ordered to.
Harry, how fast can you

402
00:25:55,559 --> 00:25:57,336
get a signal out?

403
00:26:03,848 --> 00:26:04,719
It's a disaster.

404
00:26:04,824 --> 00:26:06,078
They're all pinned down at the seawall.

405
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,634
Do we have anything more recent?

406
00:26:07,674 --> 00:26:09,692
It's hard to find a radio
man still alive on the beach.

407
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:12,054
Communication's broken down.
They're sending reinforcements

408
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:14,744
- straight into machine gun fire.
- Is there a boat in contact

409
00:26:14,778 --> 00:26:17,747
- with the beach?
- Sir, Aurora's team is

410
00:26:17,781 --> 00:26:20,812
requesting a message go out
so the Germans can hear.

411
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,088
Okay.

412
00:26:25,122 --> 00:26:28,258
I need a destroyer to transmit
this message in the clear.

413
00:26:28,292 --> 00:26:31,094
And get Mayhew in here!

414
00:26:32,651 --> 00:26:36,199
_

415
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:38,033
_

416
00:26:38,099 --> 00:26:40,395
_

417
00:26:40,527 --> 00:26:43,948
_

418
00:26:44,212 --> 00:26:47,497

419
00:26:47,655 --> 00:26:50,729

420
00:26:50,848 --> 00:26:53,473

421
00:26:53,922 --> 00:26:54,908

428
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,873

429
00:27:23,005 --> 00:27:25,459

432
00:27:39,898 --> 00:27:42,537

433
00:27:42,735 --> 00:27:44,093
_

434
00:27:44,186 --> 00:27:45,505
_

435
00:27:45,611 --> 00:27:48,640
_

436
00:27:51,899 --> 00:27:54,629
_

437
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:55,975
_

438
00:27:56,094 --> 00:27:56,674
_

439
00:27:56,753 --> 00:27:57,743
(gunshots)

440
00:28:00,451 --> 00:28:03,453
(shooting)

441
00:28:17,309 --> 00:28:18,747
_

442
00:28:19,336 --> 00:28:20,185
(gunshots)

443
00:28:20,304 --> 00:28:22,494
_

444
00:28:31,819 --> 00:28:34,273
_

445
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:37,620
(gunshot) (moan)

446
00:28:43,534 --> 00:28:45,461
Don't shoot!

447
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,782
I'm Canadian!

448
00:28:56,264 --> 00:28:57,941
<i>How many of you made it into town?</i>

449
00:28:58,007 --> 00:28:59,933
You're looking at it.

450
00:29:00,012 --> 00:29:02,295
- That can't be true
- Brass burned us.

451
00:29:02,374 --> 00:29:04,023
- Hung us out to dry.
- Don't talk like that.

452
00:29:04,115 --> 00:29:05,368
What would you call it?

453
00:29:05,461 --> 00:29:07,097
How many of our men
are dead on the beach?

454
00:29:07,229 --> 00:29:08,179
Piled at the seawall?

455
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,725
You have any contact with
the Royal Winnipeg Sabers? Green Beach?

456
00:29:10,804 --> 00:29:13,707
No one from Green Beach got very far.

457
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:16,951
You thought the four of you
would take down this HQ?

458
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,710
We owed it to our men.

459
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:25,198
I know how desperate things look,

460
00:29:25,304 --> 00:29:27,058
but there's a guerilla team
in Pour-De-Lys, right now,

461
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:28,681
with a critical mission.

462
00:29:28,747 --> 00:29:31,265
If we can get there,
four good men like you...

463
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,601
you could make the difference.

464
00:29:34,284 --> 00:29:37,171
If you want to help,
we have to move fast.

465
00:29:37,938 --> 00:29:39,904
Let's get going, then.

466
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:47,935
Go, go, go!

467
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,363
- We could be your prisoners.
- You still have your guns.

468
00:30:02,397 --> 00:30:05,199
(several shots fired)

469
00:30:09,237 --> 00:30:12,239
(loud and distant gunshots)

470
00:30:15,177 --> 00:30:18,023
(shooting)

471
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:21,058
Go! Go!

472
00:30:39,609 --> 00:30:41,799
Put the weapon down.

473
00:30:53,863 --> 00:30:56,684
An imaginary threat to
lure the bad guys away?

474
00:30:56,989 --> 00:30:59,387
Yeah. Theoretically.

475
00:30:59,421 --> 00:31:01,303
You've got ice water in your veins,
Miss.

476
00:31:01,435 --> 00:31:05,683
Thought you spies were a shaggy lot.
It's nice to see someone in charge.

477
00:31:06,487 --> 00:31:08,150
Thank you, Major.

478
00:31:14,812 --> 00:31:16,896

496
00:33:22,462 --> 00:33:24,498
Oh, bloody hell! The tank's coming back.

497
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:27,034
- What do we do?
- Whatever we do, we gotta do it now.

498
00:33:27,068 --> 00:33:29,704
Everybody choose a target. Go!

499
00:33:32,073 --> 00:33:35,075
(swift gunning)

500
00:33:40,048 --> 00:33:42,483
(massive shot fired)

501
00:33:43,877 --> 00:33:45,579
Go, Harry!

502
00:33:58,697 --> 00:34:01,982
Don't let them get near the station!

503
00:34:04,239 --> 00:34:07,141
(explosion)

504
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:32,239
The explosives!

505
00:34:32,318 --> 00:34:35,046
Harry, get back here! Run!

506
00:34:45,491 --> 00:34:47,750
(roaring explosion)

507
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:15,682
(gunshots)

508
00:35:30,396 --> 00:35:32,887
- Get down!
- Wait!

509
00:35:33,751 --> 00:35:35,408
Hold fire!

510
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:09,241
Hello.

511
00:36:09,681 --> 00:36:11,487
I didn't think you'd be joining us.

512
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:14,536
This is Gregson,

513
00:36:14,642 --> 00:36:16,251
Barrett, Leclerc

514
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:18,127
- Price.
- Ma'am.

515
00:36:19,602 --> 00:36:21,489
You really all spies?

516
00:36:22,254 --> 00:36:25,110
They...
they jumped to their own conclusions.

517
00:36:25,492 --> 00:36:27,695
Does that mean you couldn't...

518
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:29,672
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

519
00:36:30,176 --> 00:36:32,062
It's not looking good down there.

520
00:36:32,181 --> 00:36:33,643
If they haven't called
an official retreat yet,

521
00:36:33,677 --> 00:36:36,312
- it's gotta be coming soon.
- So we're out of time.

522
00:36:37,106 --> 00:36:40,074
We've gotta go, boys. Glad to have you.

523
00:36:41,819 --> 00:36:43,623
Shall we?

524
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:46,605
Where's Miri?

525
00:36:47,528 --> 00:36:48,157
The last I saw her,

526
00:36:48,192 --> 00:36:50,623
she was picking off Germans
from a church tower.

527
00:36:51,348 --> 00:36:54,063
Nuns really didn't smooth off
her rough edges, did they?

528
00:36:54,448 --> 00:36:57,588
- She's a survivor, Neil.
- Yeah, course she is.

529
00:36:58,024 --> 00:36:59,669
George, Conrad?

530
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:23,513
_

531
00:37:24,015 --> 00:37:25,308
_

532
00:37:29,072 --> 00:37:32,159
_

533
00:37:33,333 --> 00:37:34,995
_

534
00:37:35,523 --> 00:37:38,808
_

535
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:44,150
_

536
00:37:55,762 --> 00:37:59,694
_

537
00:37:59,799 --> 00:38:03,718
_

538
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:08,018
_

539
00:38:08,443 --> 00:38:10,237
_

540
00:38:10,817 --> 00:38:12,981
_

541
00:38:13,482 --> 00:38:15,355
_

542
00:38:15,989 --> 00:38:17,941
_

543
00:38:23,833 --> 00:38:25,888
Retreat?

544
00:38:25,923 --> 00:38:28,503
The generals are in agreement.
The mission has achieved

545
00:38:28,596 --> 00:38:31,461
all it can at this time.
Best to regroup,

546
00:38:31,495 --> 00:38:33,463
start assessing the wins and losses.

547
00:38:33,497 --> 00:38:36,966
Calling a retreat 5 hours in?
The men left on that beach

548
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,968
don't get to retreat,
and I've got a team out there waiting

549
00:38:39,002 --> 00:38:41,260
for reinforcements that'll never come.

550
00:38:41,432 --> 00:38:43,706
(knocking) Come in.

551
00:38:44,229 --> 00:38:45,825
Thank you.

552
00:38:52,950 --> 00:38:56,719
- My God. Are these confirmed?
- There's a lot

553
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:59,555
of contradiction. It's chaos.

554
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,058
Casualties running at 60%?

555
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:05,394
Dead, wounded, captured, yes.

556
00:39:06,985 --> 00:39:08,950
Three thousand men.

557
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:13,569
"First Canadian Tank destroyed.

558
00:39:13,604 --> 00:39:15,771
"The Royal Regiment, Wentworth,

559
00:39:15,806 --> 00:39:18,107
Fusiliers Mont Royal..."

560
00:39:21,474 --> 00:39:24,280
Essex Scottish, gone.

561
00:39:24,983 --> 00:39:26,182
They got HMS Berkeley.

562
00:39:26,216 --> 00:39:28,751
And 100 aircraft.

563
00:39:30,228 --> 00:39:31,254
Two years waiting.

564
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:33,804
All the Canadians
wanted was to get in it.

565
00:39:34,384 --> 00:39:36,508
I'll try and find out some more.

566
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:51,641
There it is. Stay down.

567
00:39:55,942 --> 00:39:58,383
They're adding even more barbed wire,

568
00:39:58,488 --> 00:40:00,414
reinforcements.

569
00:40:00,625 --> 00:40:03,251
It's a hell of a lot more
fortified now than it was.

570
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:06,188
And we used our explosives on that tank.

571
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:11,661
Even with these good men, this is...

572
00:40:16,199 --> 00:40:18,223
Guys, you were...

573
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:21,837
you were right to question my judgment.

574
00:40:22,325 --> 00:40:24,640
I do it all the time.

575
00:40:25,782 --> 00:40:27,810
Rene once told me

576
00:40:28,236 --> 00:40:31,732
the only leaders who
don't feel like impostors

577
00:40:31,824 --> 00:40:34,517
are the impostors.

578
00:40:35,131 --> 00:40:38,487
To be honest, I feel like one right now.

579
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:41,257
I shouldn't have turned my back on you,
Harry.

580
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:45,738
I'm sorry. You deserved better.

581
00:40:46,697 --> 00:40:49,632
I should have told you
all about Rene myself.

582
00:40:52,904 --> 00:40:56,004
You know, 50% die in the first 6 weeks.

583
00:40:56,083 --> 00:40:58,708
How the hell have we
stayed alive this long?

584
00:40:59,414 --> 00:41:01,344
Blind luck.

585
00:41:02,725 --> 00:41:04,163
Good breeding.

586
00:41:07,211 --> 00:41:09,124
I'm storming the castle.

587
00:41:10,754 --> 00:41:13,640
I'm not going to order
you to do the same.

588
00:41:14,247 --> 00:41:16,092
Decide for yourselves.

589
00:41:16,978 --> 00:41:18,878
You've earned that.

590
00:41:26,215 --> 00:41:28,804
- You know what I'm thinking about?
- What?

591
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,741
That first mission.

592
00:41:31,775 --> 00:41:33,909
The air drop.

593
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:37,140
It was so loud in the plane,

594
00:41:37,364 --> 00:41:39,615
and then we stepped out

595
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:41,617
into the sky and...

596
00:41:42,852 --> 00:41:44,172
Peace.

597
00:41:44,356 --> 00:41:45,788
Peace.

598
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:52,010
- I'm glad you're here, Alfred.
- Me too.

599
00:41:54,042 --> 00:41:55,546
Aurora.

600
00:41:58,329 --> 00:42:00,403
You just said my name.

601
00:42:01,482 --> 00:42:02,789
Yeah.

602
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:17,486
Hey.

603
00:42:18,882 --> 00:42:20,456
Ready when you are.

604
00:42:21,296 --> 00:42:22,825
Sergeant.

605
00:42:38,508 --> 00:42:40,776
