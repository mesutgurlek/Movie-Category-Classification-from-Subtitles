00:30:48,814 --> 00:30:49,713
LCF?

505
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:52,950
Seriously, what the fuck
is all this shit, anyways?

506
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:54,551
Or whatever, brah.

507
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:56,653
It makes me look fierce.

508
00:30:56,655 --> 00:31:00,123
Gotta intimidate the squidlets, you know.

509
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:01,225
Make 'em ink.

510
00:31:01,227 --> 00:31:03,961
Oh shit, I think I just did.

511
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:09,399
Seriously, where the fuck
did you find this shit pump?

512
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:10,634
He's not that bad.

513
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:11,869
He's a good laugh.

514
00:31:11,871 --> 00:31:13,203
Still awaiting parts, though.

515
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,038
Well, that's great.

516
00:31:18,243 --> 00:31:19,977
So what about the EVAC?

517
00:31:19,979 --> 00:31:21,144
Ah, it's gettin' pretty dark.

518
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:22,145
And they're not gonna fly at night.

519
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:23,046
It's too hairy.

520
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,147
So, what's the plan?

521
00:31:24,149 --> 00:31:25,482
First off, we gotta get off this beach.

522
00:31:25,484 --> 00:31:26,884
We're too exposed.

523
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:28,518
Then we're gonna send a team up

524
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,553
out of the valley,

525
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:31,755
try to make contact with HQ.

526
00:31:31,757 --> 00:31:34,191
Then we just gotta standby to standby.

527
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:36,193
What about the sarge?
We can't move him far.

528
00:31:36,195 --> 00:31:37,294
We'll figure it out.

529
00:31:37,296 --> 00:31:39,763
we gotta get outta here before nightfall.

530
00:31:39,765 --> 00:31:41,098
This place is gonna be teeming with squids

531
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:44,101
before the sun sets.

532
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:45,836
What's up with him?

533
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,206
Ah, few cuts and bruises, nothing serious.

534
00:31:49,208 --> 00:31:51,909
Ah, I don't think he has a concussion, ah...

535
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,110
...shock, maybe?

536
00:31:53,112 --> 00:31:54,745
All right, Lappy...

537
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:55,779
You take the kid up the valley,

538
00:31:55,781 --> 00:31:58,081
try to make contact with HQ.

539
00:31:58,083 --> 00:32:00,250
Radio when you're close,
and we'll give you the grids.

540
00:32:00,252 --> 00:32:01,685
- You copy?
- Roger that.

541
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:02,653
Outstanding.

542
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,390
Doc, I need to make sure that Mikusek's mobile.

543
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:07,691
Johnson, help the doc out.

544
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:09,927
- We gotta move.
- Okay.

545
00:32:16,134 --> 00:32:17,567
Hey.

546
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,469
Let's move out.

547
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,105
Radio check.
How copy?

548
00:32:22,107 --> 00:32:23,707
Solid copy, over.

549
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:11,254
Cover my flank.

550
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:15,459
Crow's nest,

551
00:33:15,461 --> 00:33:18,128
this is Coyote two three, requesting actual.

552
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,229
Copy.

553
00:33:25,303 --> 00:33:26,336
Crow's nest,

554
00:33:26,338 --> 00:33:29,473
this is Coyote two three, do you copy?

555
00:33:29,475 --> 00:33:30,774
Over.

556
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:40,117
Crow's nest,

557
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:44,121
this is Coyote two three, requesting actual.

558
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:45,255
Copy.

559
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,391
Copy that, Coyote two three,

560
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:49,159
this is Crow's nest, actual.

561
00:33:49,161 --> 00:33:51,261
Requesting sit rep, over.

562
00:33:52,463 --> 00:33:54,197
I copy.

563
00:33:54,199 --> 00:33:56,600
We have a situation.

564
00:34:03,574 --> 00:34:05,008
So what'd you get?

565
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:08,412
Um, chili and beans.
You?

566
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:10,247
Spaghetti and meatballs.

567
00:34:10,249 --> 00:34:11,348
Do you want to trade?

568
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,216
No, man.

569
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:14,885
Remember New Dayton?

570
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,820
Yeah.
Eight-seventy-one, right?

571
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:18,321
Yeah.

572
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:21,892
They dropped, like, fifty crates
of chili and beans,

573
00:34:21,894 --> 00:34:23,226
and nothing else.

574
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:25,095
I had to eat that shit three times a day

575
00:34:25,097 --> 00:34:26,930
for a whole week.

576
00:34:26,932 --> 00:34:29,366
You know, we lost a guy.

577
00:34:29,368 --> 00:34:30,801
Private Packer...

578
00:34:31,702 --> 00:34:33,603
...shot himself in the face.

579
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,105
Jesus.

580
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:36,907
Not because of the chili, though?

581
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,675
No, man, I was there.

582
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,977
It was 'cause of the chili.

583
00:34:45,049 --> 00:34:46,216
Soldier bar.

584
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:47,684
Hey-ooh!

585
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:48,718
Nice.

586
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,287
Hey, do you have a heating pad?

587
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:51,855
Yeah, I only have one though.

588
00:34:51,857 --> 00:34:54,157
You can use it after I'm done.

589
00:34:55,860 --> 00:34:57,127
You know...

590
00:34:58,129 --> 00:34:59,963
I think they should just give us, like,

591
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:01,598
two dozen of these.

592
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,467
It's got everything a growing boy needs.

593
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:04,968
Lots of protein.

594
00:35:04,970 --> 00:35:06,603
And calories.

595
00:35:10,074 --> 00:35:12,375
- Hey, Doc?
- Mm-hmm?

596
00:35:12,377 --> 00:35:14,945
You ever think about...

597
00:35:14,947 --> 00:35:17,147
...what the aliens eat?

598
00:35:17,149 --> 00:35:18,815
Not rally.

599
00:35:18,817 --> 00:35:20,851
Or how they fuck?

600
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,754
- No.
- Oh, come on, man.

601
00:35:24,756 --> 00:35:26,823
Expand your fuckin' mind.

602
00:35:27,925 --> 00:35:30,460
You know, when you think about it,

603
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,729
I bet those aliens give really good head.

604
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:36,133
All those little tentacles...
licking your balls.

605
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:37,501
[moan]
[cough]

606
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:39,136
[louder moan]

607
00:35:39,138 --> 00:35:40,937
All right.

608
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:42,739
What, you're not gonna have yours?

609
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:43,974
Nah.

610
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,509
Then, can I have it?

611
00:35:45,511 --> 00:35:46,810
I thought you were sick of chili and beans?

612
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:49,179
I'm hungry.

613
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:04,461
[coughing, sputtering]

614
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,210
[heavy, deep breaths]

615
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:29,052
Hey, do you have a SAT phone?

616
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:32,155
Yeah, it's busted since the EMP blast, so...

617
00:36:32,157 --> 00:36:34,224
I might be able to use some of your parts

618
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:34,991
to fix one.

619
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:36,626
Yeah, sure.

620
00:36:38,829 --> 00:36:40,030
Thanks.

621
00:36:41,499 --> 00:36:42,666
Who you gonna call?

622
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:44,501
My wife.

623
00:36:44,503 --> 00:36:46,703
Ghostbusters, man.
Come on.

624
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,038
[chuckles]
Sorry.

625
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:49,739
Long day.

626
00:36:57,081 --> 00:36:59,216
Where did Szwedowicz and Hatfield go?

627
00:36:59,218 --> 00:37:00,050
Hm?

628
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:02,919
Those CSOR guys, they're gone.

629
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,487
What?

630
00:37:07,892 --> 00:37:10,293
Szwedowicz, Hatfield, do you copy?

631
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:15,065
when you need to talk to somebody.

632
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:17,534
Fuckin' special forces, man.

633
00:37:17,536 --> 00:37:19,669
They think they're so much better than us.

634
00:37:19,671 --> 00:37:22,305
That fuckin' Szwedowicz is such a cock smoke.

635
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,008
Yeah, well...

636
00:37:26,277 --> 00:37:28,044
They couldn't have gone far.

637
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:30,080
Yeah, they wouldn't just leave us here, right?

638
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:31,214
Their box is still here,

639
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:34,117
they've been keeping that pretty close.

640
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,019
- Any idea what's in it?
- No.

641
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:36,886
Gotta be important, though,

642
00:37:36,888 --> 00:37:38,855
the way they've been protecting it.

643
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,290
Well...

644
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,360
They're not here now.

645
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:46,263
Why don't we, ah, have a little looksie?

646
00:37:46,265 --> 00:37:48,865
Ah, I don't know, man.

647
00:37:48,867 --> 00:37:50,367
You know what those symbols mean?

648
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:51,601
Uh, nuclear?

649
00:37:51,603 --> 00:37:53,203
No, biohazard.

650
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:55,572
You mean like needles and shit,

651
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:56,806
in the hospital?

652
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:58,375
That's fuckin' rank, man.

653
00:37:58,377 --> 00:37:59,409
Yeah.

654
00:38:00,077 --> 00:38:01,544
It also says,
"Do not open."

655
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:04,781
[unearthly roar]

656
00:38:04,783 --> 00:38:06,950
Well, that's terrifying.

657
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,053
Roger that, Crow's nest.

658
00:38:10,055 --> 00:38:12,455
Looking forward to seeing your boys soon.

659
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,357
Coyote two three, out.

660
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,027
Let's move out.

661
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,773
Shit, doc.

662
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:31,174
Fuck.

663
00:38:31,176 --> 00:38:32,809
Yeah, you said it.

664
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,947
So...

665
00:38:37,949 --> 00:38:39,816
What do you say?

666
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,818
Wanna take a look?

667
00:38:42,687 --> 00:38:43,853
I think I'll pass.

668
00:38:43,855 --> 00:38:46,256
[laughter]
Pussy.

669
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:51,728
[voices murmuring indistinctly, ethereally]

670
00:39:02,473 --> 00:39:04,040
Johnson!

671
00:39:07,345 --> 00:39:08,945
Johnson.

672
00:39:12,483 --> 00:39:14,050
Johnson.

673
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,389
