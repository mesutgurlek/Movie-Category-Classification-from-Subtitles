1
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:03,334
Director Chen, it appears

2
00:02:03,342 --> 00:02:07,142
you will kiss and make up with the CPC.

3
00:02:07,158 --> 00:02:09,092
You don't approve?

4
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:12,001
You don't know the CPC

5
00:02:12,018 --> 00:02:13,929
like we do.

6
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:15,989
While you were making passes at them,

7
00:02:15,998 --> 00:02:17,010
we fought them head on

8
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:18,932
in France.

9
00:02:19,737 --> 00:02:21,648
l heard you intend to resign.

10
00:02:31,426 --> 00:02:33,235
Even if you resign,

11
00:02:33,242 --> 00:02:35,290
wait till after the capitulation
ceremony in Nanjing.

12
00:02:36,188 --> 00:02:37,280
You helped defeat the Japanese.

13
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:41,989
The ceremony needs a
national hero like you.

14
00:02:43,858 --> 00:02:45,792
lf l don't resign,

15
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,734
l'll be blamed for the civil war.

16
00:02:47,809 --> 00:02:48,889
Welcome, Mr. Mao.

17
00:02:51,809 --> 00:02:53,697
Welcome to Chongqing, Mr. Mao.

18
00:02:55,499 --> 00:02:57,421
We've been fighting the enemy

19
00:02:57,432 --> 00:02:59,297
for 8 years.

20
00:02:59,315 --> 00:03:00,486
lt's my job

21
00:03:00,504 --> 00:03:01,414
to fight till the end.

22
00:03:02,252 --> 00:03:03,344
Now that we won,

23
00:03:03,354 --> 00:03:05,288
why

24
00:03:05,296 --> 00:03:07,105
are we stilling fighting?

25
00:03:08,107 --> 00:03:10,894
l will not

26
00:03:10,908 --> 00:03:11,897
fight my own kind.

27
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:14,959
General Malinovsky has agreed

28
00:03:14,966 --> 00:03:16,866
to hand over the Northeast provinces.

29
00:03:16,874 --> 00:03:19,695
No need to fight anymore?

30
00:03:19,704 --> 00:03:22,411
lf we don't,

31
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:23,511
will the CPC hand over their turf?

32
00:03:23,598 --> 00:03:26,396
Ladies and gentlemen.

33
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:29,333
Chairman Chiang and Mr.
Mao propose a toast.

34
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,161
To peace, cheers.

35
00:03:32,173 --> 00:03:33,925
Cheers.

36
00:03:54,119 --> 00:03:55,063
Chairman Chiang.

37
00:03:55,079 --> 00:03:56,103
Hello, Chairman Chiang.

38
00:03:56,114 --> 00:03:57,046
Hello, Mr. Mao.

39
00:03:57,064 --> 00:03:58,952
l'm from the "Central Daily''.

40
00:03:58,963 --> 00:04:00,931
l notice you're both
wearing Mandarin suit.

41
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,917
On a special day like today,

42
00:04:02,925 --> 00:04:06,702
is there a special meaning for that?

43
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:15,319
The Mandarin suit

44
00:04:15,327 --> 00:04:20,014
is the official attire for all civil
servants of the Nationalist Government.

45
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:21,915
As the Chairman

46
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:23,951
of KMT,

47
00:04:23,959 --> 00:04:26,803
it's my duty

48
00:04:26,818 --> 00:04:29,764
to welcome Mr. Mao to Chongqing.

49
00:04:29,772 --> 00:04:33,572
l'm wearing the Mandarin
suit out of respect.

50
00:04:34,376 --> 00:04:36,469
Mr. Mao, is that your reason too?

51
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:39,230
The reason is simple.

52
00:04:39,239 --> 00:04:43,039
Chairman Chiang and l are
both Dr. Sun's disciples.

53
00:04:43,047 --> 00:04:45,015
Both the KMT and the
CPC have inherited

54
00:04:45,033 --> 00:04:48,753
Dr. Sun's revolutionary legacy.

55
00:04:48,764 --> 00:04:51,836
We share the same roots.

56
00:04:51,843 --> 00:04:54,653
lt is only natural that

57
00:04:54,663 --> 00:04:56,528
Dr. Sun's disciples should
wear the Mandarin suits.

58
00:04:56,543 --> 00:04:58,386
Mr. Mao. Excuse me.

59
00:04:59,324 --> 00:05:01,280
Pardon me, Mr. Mao.

60
00:05:02,279 --> 00:05:05,168
To see you standing next to each other,

61
00:05:07,036 --> 00:05:08,901
l can't help but feel excited.

62
00:05:08,916 --> 00:05:10,952
l have another question for Mr. Mao.

63
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:14,759
ln the upcoming negotiation

64
00:05:14,777 --> 00:05:16,597
ith regards to the issue of democracy,

65
00:05:16,609 --> 00:05:18,577
will the Parties find common ground

66
00:05:18,594 --> 00:05:19,595
or reach any consensus?

67
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:23,441
Definitely, if you look hard enough.

68
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:25,288
This reporter already noticed

69
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:29,087
we had something in common.

70
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,722
The North China division of the CPC

71
00:05:36,828 --> 00:05:38,614
and the Shandong division

72
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:40,588
are infiltrating the Northeast.

73
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:41,701
Chen Yi's New Fourth Army

74
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:44,521
is active around
Shanghai and Hangzhou,

75
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:49,264
making it difficult for the Nationalist
Government to move the capital back to Nanjing.

76
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:53,214
Our troops are too far
away from these regions.

77
00:05:53,221 --> 00:05:55,121
The Americans have landed in Qingdao.

78
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:56,983
They promised to send
planes and warships

79
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,831
to get our troops to the
Northeast, North China,

80
00:05:58,842 --> 00:06:00,696
East China and south of Yangtze River.

81
00:06:00,712 --> 00:06:03,590
General Du, l'm counting
on you in the Northeast.

82
00:06:12,318 --> 00:06:15,173
Master Zhang, please give
us your honest opinion.

83
00:06:15,186 --> 00:06:17,040
The CPC

84
00:06:17,056 --> 00:06:18,933
likes to keep things in the open.

85
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:21,779
We never hide our views

86
00:06:21,929 --> 00:06:24,830
and respect those of our friends
and the China Democratic League.

87
00:06:25,689 --> 00:06:26,724
Sir?

88
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:29,521
Thank you.

89
00:06:29,535 --> 00:06:34,256
l'll be honest with you, as a friend.

90
00:06:35,377 --> 00:06:37,345
To form a democratic
coalition government,

91
00:06:37,353 --> 00:06:42,985
peace and unity are the
only ways forward.

92
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,824
lf Mr. Chiang and Mr. Mao
can sit down and talk,

93
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,740
it would be wonderful.

94
00:06:49,755 --> 00:06:53,486
A negotiation requires
concessions and compromises

95
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:56,431
in order to bring about peace.

96
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,398
Chairman Mao came to Chongqing.

97
00:06:59,414 --> 00:07:03,032
That alone proves our sincerity.

98
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:06,098
The turf and army are minor details.

99
00:07:06,109 --> 00:07:10,842
Rather than haggle over them,

100
00:07:10,857 --> 00:07:14,532
why not unify all the parties?

101
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:15,711
At this moment,

102
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,305
the Nationalist Army is busy

103
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,396
in regions where we
have set up our regime

104
00:07:22,405 --> 00:07:26,136
with strategic blockades
or explorative attacks.

105
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:28,944
The Eighth Route Army
and New Fourth Army

106
00:07:28,956 --> 00:07:31,845
are thorns in Mr. Chiang's flesh.

107
00:07:31,853 --> 00:07:33,787
Pardon me for saying this.

108
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,802
lf we didn't have a few
hundred thousand used guns,

109
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:39,617
Mr. Chiang would never
sit down and talk to us.

110
00:07:39,632 --> 00:07:41,600
Ze.

111
00:07:41,608 --> 00:07:45,226
lf neither Party let go,

112
00:07:45,243 --> 00:07:47,211
the war will go on.

113
00:07:47,373 --> 00:07:51,127
You can forget about peace.

114
00:07:51,142 --> 00:07:53,963
lf neither Party gives in,

115
00:07:53,972 --> 00:07:56,736
negotiation will break down.

116
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,780
l appreciate

117
00:07:58,797 --> 00:08:01,630
your mediation.

118
00:08:01,645 --> 00:08:03,476
Very well.

119
00:08:03,487 --> 00:08:06,456
For the sake of peace and democracy,

120
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,279
we'll make the first concession.

121
00:08:08,379 --> 00:08:11,132
Among the 100 divisions of
the national defense army,

122
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:13,086
our request for 48 divisions

123
00:08:13,098 --> 00:08:14,998
has been cut back to 20 divisions.

124
00:08:15,007 --> 00:08:16,076
We're willing to give
up 8 liberated regions

125
00:08:16,091 --> 00:08:17,843
in south of Yangtze River.

126
00:08:17,855 --> 00:08:18,992
l hope that our concession

127
00:08:19,006 --> 00:08:21,713
will set the consultative
meeting in motion

128
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:24,585
and help set up a coalition government.

129
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,245
l'm here on behalf of President Truman
and the United States government

130
00:08:37,259 --> 00:08:39,124
to issue the following statement.

131
00:08:39,284 --> 00:08:41,195
We have no intention to support

132
00:08:41,203 --> 00:08:45,003
a "Cream of Wheat'' Marxist
to take over China.

133
00:08:46,837 --> 00:08:50,716
The present Nationalist Government
of China and Mr. Chiang Kai-shek

134
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:53,476
are faithful friends of the United States.

135
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:55,457
Our only concern is

136
00:08:55,466 --> 00:09:01,143
whether the Yalta Conference and

137
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:05,958
the Sino-Russian
Friendship Alliance Treaty

138
00:09:05,975 --> 00:09:08,079
will be honored and implemented
by the Chongqing government.

139
00:09:08,922 --> 00:09:10,867
The United States is cognizant that

140
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,634
the Nationalist government of
China is a one-party government

141
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:19,385
and believes that peace, unity
and democratic reform in China

142
00:09:19,403 --> 00:09:22,304
can be furthered if the
basis of this government

143
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,175
is broadened to include

144
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:26,316
other political elements in the country.

145
00:09:27,273 --> 00:09:32,006
On behalf of the CPC, l wish to
issue the following statement.

146
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:35,735
We welcome President Truman's China
policy as per the declaration on the 15th

147
00:09:35,748 --> 00:09:38,797
with regards to the cease fire

148
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:41,471
between the KMT, CPC

149
00:09:41,535 --> 00:09:43,491
and other political parties

150
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:46,279
and to call upon a multi-party meeting

151
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,345
to implement reforms

152
00:09:48,359 --> 00:09:50,111
to end the KMT's one-party dictatorship

153
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:52,225
and to ensure fair and

154
00:09:52,237 --> 00:09:55,957
effective representation of all parties

155
00:09:55,970 --> 00:10:00,737
to facilitate the democratic
unification of China.

156
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:04,683
President Truman's special envoy,

157
00:10:04,695 --> 00:10:07,380
Marshall, is arriving soon

158
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:10,321
to mediate in the civil war.

159
00:10:10,396 --> 00:10:12,375
Don't slight him.

160
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:15,221
Peace or war,

161
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:18,111
you should know better.

162
00:10:20,886 --> 00:10:24,743
Stop when we want to stop.

163
00:10:24,754 --> 00:10:27,712
Fight when we want to fight.

164
00:10:31,396 --> 00:10:34,240
This is the only case.

165
00:10:34,256 --> 00:10:38,204
Not until we say so.

166
00:10:40,091 --> 00:10:42,025
The purpose of this Assembly

167
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,998
is to seek political
reforms towards democracy.

168
00:10:45,025 --> 00:10:46,890
The basis of our negotiation

169
00:10:46,906 --> 00:10:51,570
is to establish a multi-party
coalition government

170
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,595
to facilitate a peaceful unification.

171
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:58,381
Kai,

172
00:10:58,394 --> 00:11:01,170
there are over 30 seats in the Senate.

173
00:11:01,178 --> 00:11:03,157
We have to give up 8 of them?

174
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:05,983
To give up 8 seats

175
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:08,032
is to oust 8 of our men

176
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,737
and hand them to someone else.

177
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:15,637
Who owns the world
now? lt's hardly KMT.

178
00:11:15,651 --> 00:11:17,573
Father.

179
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:20,378
Central Club and the others
have secretly agreed

180
00:11:20,392 --> 00:11:23,190
not to acknowledge the CPPCC

181
00:11:23,205 --> 00:11:28,006
and refused to give up their
seats for the CDL and CPC.

182
00:11:28,013 --> 00:11:29,128
There'll be trouble

183
00:11:31,094 --> 00:11:33,767
if they keep this up.

184
00:11:35,864 --> 00:11:39,595
Fellow students, teachers

185
00:11:39,607 --> 00:11:41,620
and friends of Sichuan.

186
00:11:41,632 --> 00:11:44,465
5 months ago, we gathered here

187
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,157
to celebrate a national victory.

188
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:51,069
That's outrageous. Lower your whip.

189
00:11:51,086 --> 00:11:52,974
Mind your own business.

190
00:11:53,054 --> 00:11:54,999
She's my girl.

191
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:56,934
You have no say.

192
00:12:00,732 --> 00:12:02,666
Whoever feeds her,

193
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,591
owns her.

194
00:12:08,324 --> 00:12:09,404
Hey. Stop it.

195
00:12:23,690 --> 00:12:24,725
Are you alright, Miss?

196
00:12:38,096 --> 00:12:40,109
Who fired that shot? Who was it?

197
00:12:40,121 --> 00:12:42,043
Who was it? Who fired that shot?

198
00:12:48,846 --> 00:12:49,744
Sir.

199
00:12:49,796 --> 00:12:52,594
No open fire in the city, Sir.

200
00:12:52,608 --> 00:12:54,496
But they can beat people up?

201
00:13:00,267 --> 00:13:02,144
l don't care who you work for.

202
00:13:02,234 --> 00:13:04,145
Send a message for me.

203
00:13:05,066 --> 00:13:07,967
Don't sneak around.

204
00:13:07,984 --> 00:13:09,770
Stop this underhanded nonsense.

205
00:13:13,598 --> 00:13:19,480
Extra: Mr. Chiang calls for a meeting.

206
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:20,397
Newspaper.

207
00:13:21,392 --> 00:13:23,212
Here.

208
00:13:29,914 --> 00:13:31,051
Chiang has taken the gloves off.

209
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:33,876
He's calling the National
People's Congress without us.

210
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:40,640
lt's his one-man show.

211
00:13:55,848 --> 00:13:58,897
The sooner we set the date for the NPC,

212
00:13:59,783 --> 00:14:03,526
the sooner the US will
confirm their assistance.

213
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:11,297
We can't have the NPC
with the KMT alone.

214
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:16,082
We can forget the CPC.

215
00:14:17,068 --> 00:14:22,665
For appearance, we still
have the other parties.

216
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,488
The CPC and the other parties

217
00:14:29,498 --> 00:14:32,319
insisted on implementing the
resolution of the CPPCC in Chongqing.

218
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:35,297
What will you do?

219
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:41,041
Pacify Zhang Lan.

220
00:14:42,051 --> 00:14:45,873
Coax and fight the CPC
at the same time.

221
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:49,589
When Mao runs out of troops,

222
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:51,680
we can stop coaxing.

223
00:15:17,602 --> 00:15:21,322
4 days ago in Kunming, Mr. Li Gongpu

224
00:15:22,247 --> 00:15:25,171
was murdered by secret
agents of the KMT.

225
00:15:25,184 --> 00:15:29,109
What crime has he committed
to deserve such a fate?

226
00:15:29,973 --> 00:15:32,953
He used his pen and he spoke up.

227
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:35,823
Everything he wrote and said

228
00:15:35,837 --> 00:15:39,477
was precisely what any
Chinese with a conscience

229
00:15:39,494 --> 00:15:41,382
should write and speak of.

230
00:15:42,412 --> 00:15:45,427
What a shame.

231
00:15:47,297 --> 00:15:50,061
The counter-revolutionaries' shame

232
00:15:51,117 --> 00:15:54,848
is precisely Mr. Li's honor.

233
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:00,587
His blood will not be shed in vain.

234
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,422
Mr. Li gave up his life.

235
00:16:04,448 --> 00:16:06,336
There's a price to be paid for his life.

236
00:16:07,328 --> 00:16:10,343
Justice will prevail,

237
00:16:12,146 --> 00:16:16,128
because truth will prevail.

238
00:16:16,148 --> 00:16:27,480
We want democracy, not civil war.

239
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,700
Tell him l went out.

240
00:17:35,647 --> 00:17:37,626
Sir.

241
00:17:40,445 --> 00:17:42,458
The Chairman is not here for real.

242
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:47,115
He sent me on an overseas expedition.

243
00:17:47,327 --> 00:17:50,046
l came to say goodbye
to my sworn brother.

244
00:17:50,974 --> 00:17:52,020
But he's not here.

245
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:56,700
Vice President, why the lantern?

246
00:17:56,714 --> 00:17:57,885
lt's broad daylight.

247
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,624
Daylight?

248
00:18:03,586 --> 00:18:05,531
l see only darkness.

249
00:18:06,350 --> 00:18:08,306
l can't see without a lantern.

250
00:18:08,327 --> 00:18:09,385
You must be kidding, Sir.

251
00:18:09,402 --> 00:18:12,064
l'm not in the mood.

252
00:18:13,136 --> 00:18:15,912
"'The Three Principles of the People''
is the cornerstone of our Party.

253
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:18,042
lf he's bent on having his way,

254
00:18:18,923 --> 00:18:22,745
the days of our Party are numbered.

255
00:18:24,576 --> 00:18:26,487
That's all l have to say.

256
00:18:26,496 --> 00:18:27,611
Tell him to take care.

257
00:18:31,285 --> 00:18:35,153
Zhangjiakou is the capital of the
Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region,

258
00:18:35,191 --> 00:18:38,012
it's also the only major
city under the CPC

259
00:18:38,128 --> 00:18:40,084
that has an arsenal that's crucial to them.

260
00:18:40,940 --> 00:18:43,943
But it'll be returned to the
Nationalist Government soon.

261
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:47,684
General, are you saying

262
00:18:47,697 --> 00:18:49,676
the manufacturing and
military base of the CPC

263
00:18:49,694 --> 00:18:51,457
doesn't exist any more?

264
00:18:52,419 --> 00:18:54,512
l admire Mao for never giving up.

265
00:18:54,521 --> 00:18:57,206
But talk is cheap

266
00:18:57,247 --> 00:18:58,248
and you can't just work
your finger to the bone.

267
00:18:58,332 --> 00:19:00,209
Power is everything.

268
00:19:01,172 --> 00:19:02,161
According to you,

269
00:19:02,171 --> 00:19:05,811
the Communist Party is
doomed to fail this time?

270
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:09,832
l didn't say that.

271
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,537
l'll make you a wager.

272
00:19:13,707 --> 00:19:15,516
The CPC wins,

273
00:19:15,531 --> 00:19:19,285
l'm willing to hold Mao's horsewhip.

274
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,154
20 years ago,

275
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:26,160
we surrendered our arms

276
00:19:26,175 --> 00:19:28,086
for peace.

277
00:19:28,094 --> 00:19:31,848
What happened? We got
a massacre in return,

278
00:19:31,857 --> 00:19:34,599
not peace.

279
00:19:34,611 --> 00:19:36,670
We learn from our mistakes.

280
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:39,562
For peace,

281
00:19:39,573 --> 00:19:42,451
for our future and to eliminate war.

282
00:19:42,462 --> 00:19:46,137
ln this war imposed
on us by our enemies,

283
00:19:46,157 --> 00:19:47,215
we must retaliate.

284
00:19:48,048 --> 00:19:51,916
Within 3 months of the
closing of this NPC,

285
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:54,883
our government

286
00:19:55,726 --> 00:19:56,875
will put an end to this civil war.

287
00:19:56,888 --> 00:20:01,552
We will annihilate the separatist
regime by force of arms

288
00:20:01,562 --> 00:20:04,474
to bring forth a unified country

289
00:20:04,489 --> 00:20:07,333
and bring peace to our nation.

290
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,828
Some say the evacuation from Yan'an

291
00:20:41,844 --> 00:20:44,779
marks a major setback in
the Chinese Revolution.

292
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:47,600
lf this is a setback,

293
00:20:47,612 --> 00:20:50,513
our party and this army

294
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:54,399
have survived countless setbacks.

295
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:59,272
You keep the land and lose
the people, you lose both.

296
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:03,902
You keep the people and lose
the land, you have both.

297
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:07,867
l'll trade Yan'an for the whole of China.

298
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,432
We came all this way

299
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,204
but we're still one step away from peace.

300
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:25,116
What a shame to give it up.

301
00:21:25,130 --> 00:21:28,839
Mao was right: without
guns in their hands,

302
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,732
Chiang will never negotiate with us.

303
00:21:31,743 --> 00:21:34,655
The CDL served as mediator
between the KMT and CPC.

304
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,514
But Chiang is insatiable.

305
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:39,373
The CPC gave up their turf,

306
00:21:39,382 --> 00:21:41,316
but they did not get
the peace they wanted.

307
00:21:42,338 --> 00:21:46,263
Some guarantor l am.

308
00:21:47,176 --> 00:21:49,952
Chiang wants a one-party NPC.

309
00:21:49,959 --> 00:21:52,803
lf neither the CPC or CDL shows up,

310
00:21:52,819 --> 00:21:54,867
we'll be handing the regime to him.

311
00:21:54,883 --> 00:21:56,851
Don't be stupid.

312
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:59,590
We'll fall into his trap if we show up.

313
00:21:59,605 --> 00:22:01,641
Our position is clear.

314
00:22:01,659 --> 00:22:04,401
Only a coalition government is legal.

315
00:22:05,306 --> 00:22:09,208
There'll be no NPC without peace

316
00:22:09,231 --> 00:22:12,985
and no coalition government
without political consultancy.

317
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:16,941
You're saying...

318
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,536
We side with the CPC.

319
00:22:24,694 --> 00:22:27,424
l, Zhang Lan,

320
00:22:27,438 --> 00:22:29,486
will not attend Chiang's NPC.

321
00:22:30,251 --> 00:22:31,377
Based on the experience
of the Northeast Bureau,

322
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:34,159
we implement land reforms
in the countryside.

323
00:22:34,176 --> 00:22:36,007
The results are quite obvious.

324
00:22:36,019 --> 00:22:38,010
Stay off the main road, take
the vicinity of the city,

325
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:39,083
give the land to the farmers.

326
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:42,765
We'll take over when those who
plough the land can own it.

327
00:22:43,908 --> 00:22:47,560
The supplies unit got separated.

328
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,497
We have problems with food and clothes.

329
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,248
Zedong.

330
00:22:54,255 --> 00:22:55,290
Mr. Chairman.

331
00:22:55,301 --> 00:22:57,326
l need to write an editorial
for the Xinhua News Agency.

332
00:22:57,336 --> 00:23:00,112
l need the rest of this candle for later.

333
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,041
But we're having a meeting.

334
00:23:02,058 --> 00:23:05,915
Precisely, just keep talking.

335
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,769
You don't need to see anything.

336
00:23:07,778 --> 00:23:09,700
Groping in the dark?

337
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,583
Let's get back to business.

338
00:23:14,592 --> 00:23:17,447
Chiang threw caution to the
wind and declared war.

339
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,236
Bullets don't have eyes.

340
00:23:21,311 --> 00:23:23,245
ln my opinion,

341
00:23:23,259 --> 00:23:26,012
Enlai, Bishi and l

342
00:23:26,897 --> 00:23:29,001
will form a front committee
and stay in Shanbei.

343
00:23:30,851 --> 00:23:34,764
Shaoqi, you and Zhu De form
a Central Working Committee

344
00:23:34,777 --> 00:23:37,530
and cross the Yellow
River into North China.

345
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,372
We'll work from both sides.

346
00:23:39,383 --> 00:23:42,329
Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

347
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:44,194
Keep them separate.

348
00:23:44,202 --> 00:23:46,272
We'll still have the other
when one is crushed.

349
00:23:57,734 --> 00:23:58,735
Hurry. Get out.

350
00:23:59,683 --> 00:24:01,594
Get rid of everyone inside.

351
00:24:01,602 --> 00:24:02,603
Seal up this place.

352
00:24:07,294 --> 00:24:09,216
That son of a bitch.

353
00:24:09,242 --> 00:24:11,164
He had the audacity to
seize the CDL headquarters

354
00:24:11,171 --> 00:24:12,195
and restrict our activities.

355
00:24:19,694 --> 00:24:21,787
Li Jishen and He Xiangning

356
00:24:21,796 --> 00:24:24,572
set up the Revolutionary Committee
of the KMT in Hong Kong.

357
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,578
Founding members such as
Feng Yuxiang and Cai Tingkai

358
00:24:26,595 --> 00:24:30,372
have indicated their intention
to break away from Chiang.

359
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:34,246
The KMT is splitting up.

360
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:36,127
You should leave for
Hong Kong right away.

361
00:24:36,145 --> 00:24:39,945
We'll re-open the CDL
headquarters in Hong Kong.

362
00:24:39,955 --> 00:24:40,967
But...

363
00:24:40,982 --> 00:24:42,859
l'm all for it.

364
00:24:42,873 --> 00:24:44,795
We must not miss this chance.

365
00:25:41,362 --> 00:25:43,296
l hereby announce

366
00:25:43,310 --> 00:25:47,076
the results of the first presidential
election of the Republic of China

367
00:25:54,808 --> 00:25:57,584
with the following votes:

368
00:26:02,438 --> 00:26:06,295
Chiang Kai-shek 2, 430 votes;

369
00:26:07,209 --> 00:26:10,235
Ju Zheng 269 votes.

370
00:26:10,251 --> 00:26:14,972
According to the constitution
of the ROC and electoral law,

371
00:26:14,983 --> 00:26:15,995
l hereby announce

372
00:26:16,010 --> 00:26:21,596
Mr. Chiang Kai-shek is elected
first President of the ROC.

373
00:26:29,389 --> 00:26:31,175
Congratulations.

374
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,033
Congrats.

375
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,657
Hu Zongnan wired. We lost Yan'an.

376
00:26:53,345 --> 00:26:56,178
Chiang Kai-shek was elected
President in Nanjing.

377
00:26:56,186 --> 00:26:59,075
Long live Mao Zedong in the valley.

378
00:27:00,054 --> 00:27:01,999
Nothing to brag about.

379
00:27:02,943 --> 00:27:07,619
Get rid of the 'long live'
in clause 23 of the slogan.

380
00:27:07,847 --> 00:27:11,578
Let Chiang be the emperor.

381
00:27:11,591 --> 00:27:13,422
l won't join his party.

382
00:27:16,274 --> 00:27:19,129
Clause 5,

383
00:27:20,133 --> 00:27:23,967
mere mention of the working
class is inappropriate.

384
00:27:24,979 --> 00:27:28,870
We have insisted on a
coalition government.

385
00:27:28,886 --> 00:27:31,753
lt's bad to sing a different tune.

386
00:27:33,541 --> 00:27:35,657
l agree with the amendments.

387
00:27:35,671 --> 00:27:39,402
Let's have a show of hands.

388
00:27:47,131 --> 00:27:48,985
Go on air with this.

389
00:27:56,710 --> 00:27:59,577
Xinhua Radio broadcasts

390
00:27:59,589 --> 00:28:03,502
the CPC slogan for Labor Day on May 1.

391
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,268
First, this year's Labor Day

392
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:09,180
is the day the Chinese
people head towards victory.

393
00:28:10,051 --> 00:28:12,007
Second, this year's Labor Day

394
00:28:12,018 --> 00:28:14,043
is the day the Chinese
people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek

395
00:28:14,053 --> 00:28:15,850
meets his doom.

396
00:28:15,992 --> 00:28:19,712
Fifth, all democratic
parties and organizations

397
00:28:19,725 --> 00:28:23,559
should immediately call for the CPPCC

398
00:28:23,574 --> 00:28:26,509
to discuss and elect delegates

399
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:29,353
to set up a coalition government.

400
00:28:30,225 --> 00:28:34,104
The CPC made an excellent move.

401
00:28:36,886 --> 00:28:38,865
You're the chess expert.

402
00:28:38,882 --> 00:28:41,703
This time you must make up your mind.

403
00:28:46,484 --> 00:28:50,306
lt's easier said than done.

404
00:28:51,455 --> 00:28:54,356
lt'll depend on the CPC's next move.

405
00:28:55,256 --> 00:29:00,865
l heard Li Zongren had
invited you to Nanjing.

406
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,963
Chiang wants you too.

407
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:12,159
Li Zongren.

408
00:29:12,176 --> 00:29:16,033
Sun Ke.

409
00:29:16,043 --> 00:29:18,750
Li Zongren.

410
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:20,681
lf the President is a litearati,

411
00:29:20,697 --> 00:29:22,710
l don't mind if you
become Vice President.

412
00:29:23,662 --> 00:29:25,539
But the President is already a soldier.

413
00:29:26,436 --> 00:29:30,258
The Vice President should
not be another soldier.

414
00:29:31,205 --> 00:29:35,141
People will say this is
a military government.

415
00:29:36,089 --> 00:29:39,900
Normally, l won't insist if you say so.

416
00:29:39,918 --> 00:29:44,651
But since the election,

417
00:29:44,658 --> 00:29:48,469
more than my effort is at stake.

418
00:29:48,487 --> 00:29:51,524
Not that l don't want to step down,

419
00:29:51,538 --> 00:29:56,214
l simply can't.

420
00:30:00,021 --> 00:30:02,888
Without support from the Party,

421
00:30:02,899 --> 00:30:04,992
you won't be elected.

422
00:30:05,001 --> 00:30:07,868
Why be a laughing stock?

423
00:30:09,597 --> 00:30:12,623
Let the numbers speak for themselves.

424
00:30:12,639 --> 00:30:15,415
Maybe l'll win.

425
00:30:23,166 --> 00:30:25,885
Definitely not.

426
00:30:39,421 --> 00:30:43,369
Sun Ke 1,295 votes.

427
00:30:44,305 --> 00:30:49,038
Li Zongren 1,438 votes.

428
00:30:53,757 --> 00:30:57,648
According to the constitution
of the ROC and electoral law,

429
00:30:57,662 --> 00:31:00,472
l hereby announce, Mr. Li Zongren

430
00:31:00,484 --> 00:31:04,272
is elected Vice President of the ROC.

431
00:32:57,657 --> 00:33:01,548
l

432
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:05,181
do solemnly swear...

433
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:16,801
l haven't been to Beiping in years.

434
00:33:17,818 --> 00:33:19,592
Commander-in-Chief of North China.

435
00:33:19,603 --> 00:33:21,582
5 provinces and a few hundred
thousand people under your command.

436
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,499
You're the king.

437
00:33:23,508 --> 00:33:25,362
Don't make fun of me.

438
00:33:25,552 --> 00:33:28,328
Mr. Chiang has high regard for you.

439
00:33:34,102 --> 00:33:35,091
lf the new CPPCC

440
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,819
can invite half the people on this list,

441
00:33:37,825 --> 00:33:38,883
we're half way there.

442
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:39,845
You're right.

443
00:33:39,859 --> 00:33:42,669
You better write to
General Feng personally.

444
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:46,618
l'll do that right now.

445
00:33:48,486 --> 00:33:50,499
Mr. Chairman, time to eat.

446
00:33:51,413 --> 00:33:53,313
Please join me, Enlai.

447
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:55,199
No, l must get back to Xibaipo.

448
00:33:55,212 --> 00:33:57,032
Finish eating first.

449
00:33:57,045 --> 00:33:57,989
Very well.

450
00:33:58,974 --> 00:34:00,885
Mr. Chairman,

451
00:34:00,903 --> 00:34:03,849
the cook is Xiao Yan's old lad.

452
00:34:03,935 --> 00:34:05,675
He wants to see you.

453
00:34:06,622 --> 00:34:09,523
Of course.

454
00:34:09,654 --> 00:34:11,474
Thank you, sir.

455
00:34:12,446 --> 00:34:14,334
Hurry.

456
00:34:14,452 --> 00:34:17,307
His name is Guo Bencai.
He's from my hometown.

457
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:18,197
Hello, Mr. Chairman.

458
00:34:19,288 --> 00:34:22,121
Mr. Kwok, you're a good cook.

459
00:34:22,138 --> 00:34:24,823
lt's worth everything to cook for you.

460
00:34:24,835 --> 00:34:25,790
Have a smoke.

461
00:34:25,804 --> 00:34:26,862
Thank you, sir.

462
00:34:29,652 --> 00:34:31,643
Why...

463
00:34:31,657 --> 00:34:33,670
lt's your cigarette, l want to keep it.

464
00:34:35,515 --> 00:34:36,425
Take this.

465
00:34:36,436 --> 00:34:37,323
l can't.

466
00:34:37,338 --> 00:34:38,282
Take it.

467
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:42,156
Sir, this is Liu Congwen, the mess
officer in the military zone.

468
00:34:42,318 --> 00:34:44,104
Hello, sir.

469
00:34:44,112 --> 00:34:45,044
Hello.

470
00:34:45,955 --> 00:34:46,899
Hello, Mr. Zhou.

471
00:34:46,914 --> 00:34:48,870
Hello. Mr. Kwok.

472
00:34:48,881 --> 00:34:49,882
Hello.

473
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:51,766
Mr. Chairman, any special
requests for your meals?

474
00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:52,837
We'll do the best we can.

475
00:34:53,747 --> 00:34:54,782
l don't need much.

476
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,635
Make sure we put in chili.

477
00:34:58,573 --> 00:35:00,336
l prepared for you already.

478
00:35:07,152 --> 00:35:10,019
lt'd be perfect

479
00:35:10,031 --> 00:35:12,943
if l can have stewed meat twice a month.

480
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:21,505
Big fish in Chengnanzhuang

481
00:35:21,517 --> 00:35:27,262
In a bungaIow between 2 apricot trees near the
mountains in the northern part of the viIlage

482
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,949
Per your request,

483
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:35,876
field operation units

484
00:35:35,891 --> 00:35:36,892
in Nanjing, Shanghai and
Hong Kong have been removed.

485
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:42,717
Zhang Lan is stuck in Shanghai.
Keep him under tabs.

486
00:35:42,733 --> 00:35:43,711
Yes, sir.

487
00:35:44,614 --> 00:35:48,311
Li Jishen is in Hong Kong.

488
00:35:48,327 --> 00:35:52,195
He's not on our turf.
Just keep an eye on him.

489
00:35:52,204 --> 00:35:53,239
Yes, sir.

490
00:35:54,248 --> 00:35:57,968
As for Feng Yuxiang,

491
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:01,757
he's getting tight with the CPC.

492
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:08,464
He may defect.

493
00:36:08,478 --> 00:36:10,526
lf necessary,

494
00:36:10,541 --> 00:36:13,305
l'll tidy things up a bit.

495
00:36:15,195 --> 00:36:18,141
These are prestigious men.

496
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:20,107
lf you're sloppy,

497
00:36:20,118 --> 00:36:22,848
public opinion overseas
will backfire on us.

498
00:36:23,025 --> 00:36:24,026
l understand.

499
00:36:24,043 --> 00:36:28,628
Mao's location is confirmed?

500
00:36:28,668 --> 00:36:30,681
Chengnanzhuang in Baoding.

501
00:36:30,692 --> 00:36:33,502
He won't get away this time.

502
00:36:35,365 --> 00:36:40,257
Remember, this is extremely important.

503
00:36:43,138 --> 00:36:46,027
Confirm target, roger.

504
00:37:05,295 --> 00:37:08,981
Lao Guo, where are
you going? This way.

505
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:11,878
Back to the kitchen. Chairman
Mao's food is on the stove.

506
00:37:15,716 --> 00:37:19,595
Chairman?

507
00:37:19,611 --> 00:37:21,408
He took some sleeping
pills and went to sleep.

508
00:37:21,415 --> 00:37:22,541
Wake him up. Enemy planes
will be here soon.

509
00:37:22,557 --> 00:37:24,331
Tiger, get a stretcher.

510
00:37:24,486 --> 00:37:28,297
Wake up, sir. Enemy planes are coming.

511
00:37:29,178 --> 00:37:30,156
They haven't dropped a bomb.

512
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,146
Then it'll be too late.

513
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:34,946
Let's go, sir.

514
00:37:34,955 --> 00:37:36,809
Calm down.

515
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:38,758
Cigarette.

516
00:37:38,765 --> 00:37:39,732
Do that later.

517
00:37:40,607 --> 00:37:41,619
Commander Nie.

518
00:37:41,739 --> 00:37:43,639
Move Mr. Chairman to the bomb
shelter on the stretcher.

519
00:37:43,649 --> 00:37:44,502
Yes, sir.

520
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,366
Even if they start bombing,

521
00:37:46,384 --> 00:37:48,284
that doesn't mean they'll hit me.

522
00:37:48,293 --> 00:37:49,408
l'm responsible for the Party.

523
00:37:49,425 --> 00:37:50,369
l'm very lucky.

524
00:37:50,385 --> 00:37:51,283
Hurry.

525
00:37:58,081 --> 00:38:00,743
Hurry.

526
00:38:00,912 --> 00:38:02,709
Hurry.

527
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,211
Hurry.

528
00:38:20,976 --> 00:38:23,752
Hurry.

529
00:38:25,774 --> 00:38:27,674
Hello...

530
00:38:27,684 --> 00:38:28,685
Well?

531
00:38:28,701 --> 00:38:29,690
Still can't get through.

532
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,480
Keep trying.

533
00:38:32,491 --> 00:38:33,401
Yes, sir.

534
00:38:34,362 --> 00:38:36,262
Telegram, sir.

535
00:38:40,225 --> 00:38:44,946
Massive bombings, casualties unknown.

536
00:39:08,024 --> 00:39:11,733
The food was still on the stove

537
00:39:11,747 --> 00:39:13,749
when the bombing started.

538
00:39:15,595 --> 00:39:19,577
Lao Guo said you have
not eaten breakfast.

539
00:39:23,368 --> 00:39:25,245
He ran back to the kitchen.

540
00:40:39,155 --> 00:40:41,077
Telegram, Mr. Zhou.

541
00:40:46,784 --> 00:40:47,762
Mr. Chairman,

542
00:40:47,830 --> 00:40:50,731
we have very positive response
for the May 1 slogan.

543
00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:53,557
The Parties have all signed their names.

544
00:40:53,568 --> 00:40:55,559
Already?

545
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,375
What a surprise.

546
00:40:59,402 --> 00:41:02,166
The situation is becoming clear.

547
00:41:02,175 --> 00:41:04,131
The CDL and the Revolutionary
Committee are on our side.

548
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:08,817
Chiang is now completely isolated.

549
00:41:08,835 --> 00:41:11,895
Everything will fall into place.

550
00:41:11,905 --> 00:41:12,860
lt's time to call for a new CPPCC.

551
00:41:18,555 --> 00:41:22,309
Jishen, Mao wrote you personally.

552
00:41:22,326 --> 00:41:24,214
What's your concern?

553
00:41:24,226 --> 00:41:28,117
Back in Fujian, we
agreed to oppose Chiang.

554
00:41:28,132 --> 00:41:30,020
But they changed their minds.

555
00:41:30,934 --> 00:41:33,971
Fujian was a few years ago.

556
00:41:34,906 --> 00:41:39,559
That was Bo Gu, not Mao.

557
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,572
l'm not holding a grudge.

558
00:41:41,585 --> 00:41:44,418
l don't need another fall.

559
00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:48,191
Chiang toyed with us for decades.

560
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:51,061
No doubt the CPC has better credibility,

561
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,009
but what if...

562
00:41:53,023 --> 00:41:54,968
We just set up a new Party.

563
00:41:54,981 --> 00:41:57,882
As the Chairman of Revolutionary
Committee of the KMT,

564
00:41:57,898 --> 00:42:00,719
l must do my best

565
00:42:00,728 --> 00:42:02,559
for the future of the Party.

566
00:42:02,571 --> 00:42:05,574
lssue a separate declaration

567
00:42:05,584 --> 00:42:07,381
to oppose Chiang.

568
00:42:07,397 --> 00:42:10,230
Reiterate our opposition
against one-party autocracy.

569
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:12,342
That'll be our response to the CPC.

570
00:42:15,189 --> 00:42:16,929
Nowhere inside the Shanhai Pass

571
00:42:16,945 --> 00:42:19,049
is a suitable venue for the
new consultative meeting,

572
00:42:19,066 --> 00:42:20,988
except Harbin.

573
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:22,858
lt's far away,

574
00:42:22,866 --> 00:42:24,743
but at least it's a big city.

575
00:42:26,685 --> 00:42:28,664
Feng Yuxiang will be home this month.

576
00:42:28,681 --> 00:42:30,535
He'll go directly to the Northeast.

577
00:42:33,469 --> 00:42:35,380
Then let's settle for Harbin.

578
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:40,148
To build a new government
for the whole country

579
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:43,024
without a decent big city,

580
00:42:43,036 --> 00:42:45,743
it's just not adequate.

581
00:42:45,809 --> 00:42:48,721
Goods are scarce. Commodities
entered the black market.

582
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:50,704
Everyone is buying

583
00:42:50,713 --> 00:42:52,510
and selling short.

584
00:42:52,517 --> 00:42:56,305
The top brass in the military
and political circles

585
00:42:56,317 --> 00:42:57,432
are behind these activities.

586
00:42:57,439 --> 00:42:59,225
Those profiteers

587
00:42:59,234 --> 00:43:02,067
defy government orders.

588
00:43:02,074 --> 00:43:05,020
Mr. Weng can't hold the fort much longer.

589
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:10,795
What's your solution?

590
00:43:15,566 --> 00:43:18,342
l don't want your complaints.

591
00:43:18,358 --> 00:43:19,393
l want a solution.

592
00:43:19,404 --> 00:43:21,372
As the financial center in the Far East,

593
00:43:21,381 --> 00:43:24,157
Shanghai is the key.

594
00:43:24,163 --> 00:43:26,028
lf we can stabilize the
market in Shanghai,

595
00:43:26,044 --> 00:43:28,046
the rest of the country will fall in line.

596
00:43:29,930 --> 00:43:30,976
l must go to Shanghai.

597
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:46,971
Master Chiang, on behalf of Shanghai,

598
00:43:46,978 --> 00:43:50,630
we're hosting a banquet for
you at the Jinjiang Hotel.

599
00:43:50,646 --> 00:43:52,625
l'll pick you up later.

600
00:43:53,642 --> 00:43:55,633
Tell everyone on the
Special Commando Unit

601
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:59,451
to meet in my office in half an hour,

602
00:44:02,199 --> 00:44:04,110
including you.

603
00:44:08,997 --> 00:44:11,818
ln preparing for the new CPPCC,

604
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:14,708
the CPC is open for suggestions.

605
00:44:14,721 --> 00:44:17,497
They don't intend to run the whole show.

606
00:44:17,506 --> 00:44:20,498
They do things differently
from the Nanjing government.

607
00:44:21,424 --> 00:44:23,267
What about Zhang Lan?

608
00:44:23,277 --> 00:44:26,349
He's always for building
the state via CPPCC.

609
00:44:32,006 --> 00:44:34,884
They already have a
well thought-out plan

610
00:44:34,896 --> 00:44:38,775
to escort you and my mother up north.

611
00:44:39,631 --> 00:44:43,431
Mao invited you and Li Jishen up north

612
00:44:43,443 --> 00:44:46,355
to discuss re-opening the CPPCC.

613
00:44:46,372 --> 00:44:48,283
When is Li Jishen leaving?

614
00:44:49,224 --> 00:44:50,236
Don't know yet.

615
00:44:52,172 --> 00:44:54,106
What's your answer?

616
00:44:57,943 --> 00:45:00,798
l have decided

617
00:45:01,871 --> 00:45:03,634
to stay put.

618
00:45:04,579 --> 00:45:05,557
But...

619
00:45:05,568 --> 00:45:09,550
Let Shen Junru liaise with the
CPC on behalf of the CDL.

620
00:45:12,453 --> 00:45:15,308
When are you leaving?

621
00:45:18,158 --> 00:45:23,960
l'm too old and sick.

622
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:30,696
Besides, Chiang won't
let me go that easily.

623
00:45:31,631 --> 00:45:36,341
How can you not show for
something this important?

624
00:45:36,355 --> 00:45:39,199
l'm putting Shen Junru in charge.

625
00:45:40,177 --> 00:45:45,911
l am Chinese.

626
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,899
ls that right, Father?

627
00:45:49,703 --> 00:45:50,840
One stroke is missing.

628
00:45:52,603 --> 00:45:54,594
lsn't this pretty, Uncle Mao?

629
00:45:54,610 --> 00:45:58,341
Yes, but you can't eat everything.

630
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,471
Mr. Chairman, it's time for the meeting.

631
00:46:00,478 --> 00:46:02,366
Let's go back.

632
00:46:02,379 --> 00:46:04,119
Will you carry me, Uncle Mao?

633
00:46:04,156 --> 00:46:05,248
Carry me, Father.

634
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,069
Will you carry me, Uncle Mao? Father

635
00:46:07,084 --> 00:46:08,949
Liya, do you want me to carry you?

636
00:46:08,967 --> 00:46:09,877
Yes.

637
00:46:11,838 --> 00:46:12,759
Let's go.

638
00:46:14,661 --> 00:46:16,709
Any news, Enlai?

639
00:46:16,716 --> 00:46:19,605
Chiang's economic reform is a deadlock.

640
00:46:19,616 --> 00:46:21,538
Chiang Ching-kuo personally
flew to Shanghai.

641
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:26,234
But the Bund is entrenched
with powerful factions.

642
00:46:26,252 --> 00:46:28,186
lt's a labyrinth within the KMT.

643
00:46:29,094 --> 00:46:31,142
Chiang's son won't accomplish anything.

644
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,880
Liya, let's play piggyback.

645
00:46:35,048 --> 00:46:36,879
Let's go.

646
00:47:00,755 --> 00:47:01,847
No one should doubt the Government's

647
00:47:01,860 --> 00:47:04,613
determination to implement
financial reforms.

648
00:47:04,769 --> 00:47:06,521
ln face of a national crisis,

649
00:47:06,536 --> 00:47:08,618
anyone who compromises
the nation's interest

650
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:10,495
is a traitor

651
00:47:10,512 --> 00:47:12,434
and an enemy of the KMT.

652
00:47:13,287 --> 00:47:17,098
l urge the elite of the business sector

653
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:19,953
and prominent individuals
of society to work with us

654
00:47:19,961 --> 00:47:22,031
to restore financial order
and stabilize prices

655
00:47:22,045 --> 00:47:24,821
in the shortest time possible

656
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:27,822
and do your best to save our country.

657
00:47:27,835 --> 00:47:28,790
Mr. Chiang.

658
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:31,501
Will you be fair?

659
00:47:31,513 --> 00:47:33,413
What about those offenders
who have influence?

660
00:47:33,424 --> 00:47:34,425
How will you handle them?

661
00:47:37,458 --> 00:47:39,221
My mission in Shanghai

662
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:43,031
is to hunt tigers, not squat mosquitoes.

663
00:47:43,046 --> 00:47:44,047
Mr. Chiang, can you tell us

664
00:47:44,064 --> 00:47:45,929
your concrete course of action?

665
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:50,674
Tigers are easy to hunt

666
00:47:50,690 --> 00:47:55,480
but l'm afraid icebergs

667
00:47:55,492 --> 00:47:57,540
are hard to remove.

668
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,110
You are...

669
00:48:12,777 --> 00:48:16,656
Du Yuesheng.

670
00:48:20,671 --> 00:48:26,246
Mr. Du, l'm all ears.

671
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:31,072
My son Weiping has been arrested.

672
00:48:33,039 --> 00:48:36,930
lf he broke the law, l have no complaints,

673
00:48:37,879 --> 00:48:42,555
but someone else in Shanghai

674
00:48:42,565 --> 00:48:45,534
is hoarding supplies

675
00:48:45,552 --> 00:48:47,543
and peddling them to the
black market for profits,

676
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:51,383
openly defying the law.

677
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:56,133
lf you choose to overlook this,

678
00:48:56,144 --> 00:49:00,035
President Chiang will
be very disappointed.

679
00:49:01,906 --> 00:49:04,773
Please point me in the
right direction, Mr. Du.

680
00:49:06,669 --> 00:49:10,582
l will look into it.

681
00:49:19,172 --> 00:49:20,184
Read it.

682
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:24,862
7 godowns along the Bund.

683
00:49:24,876 --> 00:49:26,844
The godown on No. 36 Nanjing Road.

684
00:49:26,854 --> 00:49:30,563
No. 17 Avenue Joffre.

685
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:33,539
12 godowns in the South
Market using the word "Jia.''

686
00:49:35,554 --> 00:49:38,341
Mr. Chiang,

687
00:49:38,358 --> 00:49:42,067
this is the real tiger.

688
00:49:47,107 --> 00:49:48,802
Who is it?

689
00:49:56,575 --> 00:50:01,456
Yangtze Company owned by the Kung's.

690
00:50:10,067 --> 00:50:14,731
Wire Wei Lihuang, urge
him to pull back south.

691
00:50:14,744 --> 00:50:16,792
With crack troops like these,

692
00:50:16,799 --> 00:50:20,565
even if we lose the Northeast,
we can get it back easily.

693
00:50:20,573 --> 00:50:24,395
President, we wired him several times

694
00:50:24,404 --> 00:50:25,462
urging him to go south,

695
00:50:25,470 --> 00:50:27,426
but he ignored us.

696
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:30,184
Get my plane ready,

697
00:50:30,195 --> 00:50:32,015
l'll fly out to Shenyang.

698
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,951
The President.

699
00:50:55,162 --> 00:50:56,197
What is it?

700
00:50:57,093 --> 00:50:59,095
Feng Yuxiang is dead.

701
00:51:26,958 --> 00:51:30,621
What happened to you?

702
00:51:31,557 --> 00:51:35,425
You bragged about your abilities.

703
00:51:35,437 --> 00:51:37,337
You bragged about Shanghai.

704
00:51:37,348 --> 00:51:39,441
You bragged about the
Red Army. And now?

705
00:51:39,451 --> 00:51:43,148
General Feng was burned to death.

706
00:51:43,158 --> 00:51:45,046
You.

707
00:51:45,059 --> 00:51:48,825
This is all you can do.

708
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:02,441
Think it over. You won't get away.

709
00:52:02,450 --> 00:52:05,328
You'll be executed if you lose a battle.

710
00:52:05,341 --> 00:52:08,048
Now something went
wrong on your front.

711
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:10,959
Tell me what you should do. Speak up.

712
00:52:10,968 --> 00:52:12,936
KMT secret agents did it?

713
00:52:12,946 --> 00:52:14,868
According to the Russians,

714
00:52:14,876 --> 00:52:16,867
General Feng was watching
a film in his cabin.

715
00:52:16,883 --> 00:52:19,590
The film caught on fire
and ignited the cabin.

716
00:52:19,601 --> 00:52:22,490
The film caught on fire? He's a general.

717
00:52:22,501 --> 00:52:24,389
Why didn't he run?

718
00:52:24,402 --> 00:52:27,269
What a bunch of morons.

719
00:52:28,301 --> 00:52:32,226
A man is dead, the Russians
need to blame someone.

720
00:52:33,199 --> 00:52:36,930
The ship was out at sea and abroad.

721
00:52:36,944 --> 00:52:39,731
We didn't get all the facts.

722
00:52:44,568 --> 00:52:47,423
General Feng became a soldier at 12.

723
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:50,512
50 years in the battlefield didn't kill him.

724
00:52:51,387 --> 00:52:54,174
But our invitation

725
00:52:54,191 --> 00:52:57,103
to send him abroad buried him at sea.

726
00:52:59,127 --> 00:53:00,981
l feel so guilty.

727
00:53:01,835 --> 00:53:05,851
General Feng may be dead

728
00:53:05,858 --> 00:53:08,702
but he left behind a legacy

729
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,631
to build a new, independent China.

730
00:53:11,543 --> 00:53:16,344
Enlai, wire our condolences
to Madame Feng

731
00:53:16,354 --> 00:53:18,345
and invite her to the CPPCC.

732
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,079
Yes.

733
00:53:20,090 --> 00:53:23,127
Mr. Chairman, it has been suggested

734
00:53:23,143 --> 00:53:25,839
that the CPPCC should act for the NPC

735
00:53:25,851 --> 00:53:27,751
to elect the central government.

736
00:53:29,817 --> 00:53:33,708
A general election is hard
to come by during the war.

737
00:53:33,726 --> 00:53:38,481
We must consult all the
other Parties on this.

738
00:53:39,344 --> 00:53:41,380
Let's not waste any time.

739
00:53:41,389 --> 00:53:45,109
Form the coalition government
first, then call the NPC,

740
00:53:45,124 --> 00:53:46,182
is that it?

741
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:47,155
Precisely.

742
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:51,975
They're still in a war.

743
00:53:51,981 --> 00:53:55,747
They can't elect their delegates.

744
00:53:55,755 --> 00:53:58,497
We should make allowances for that.

745
00:53:58,511 --> 00:54:01,503
l'll get in touch with Shen Junru

746
00:54:01,517 --> 00:54:03,360
and pass on your message.

747
00:54:04,446 --> 00:54:09,190
Mr. Mao and Mr. Zhou invited
you up north again.

748
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:15,971
Assemble.

749
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:18,650
Hurry.

750
00:54:23,661 --> 00:54:28,439
Search all the godowns,
buildings, apartments and villas

751
00:54:28,453 --> 00:54:32,287
in Shanghai owned by Yangtze
Company and the Kung's.

752
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:38,875
Operation starts at 7 am
tomorrow morning, understand?

753
00:55:02,053 --> 00:55:02,951
Mr. Chairman.

754
00:55:03,859 --> 00:55:07,647
Voices within the US
government have indicated

755
00:55:07,662 --> 00:55:09,653
they will support your
replacement of Mr. Chiang.

756
00:55:09,669 --> 00:55:11,660
What do you think?

757
00:55:14,412 --> 00:55:18,269
Whether they support me or Chiang,

758
00:55:18,282 --> 00:55:22,116
it's a cheap trick to pit
Chinese against Chinese.

759
00:55:22,124 --> 00:55:25,013
lf the US wishes to maintain diplomatic
relations with the future China,

760
00:55:25,024 --> 00:55:27,800
ignoring the CPC

761
00:55:27,808 --> 00:55:29,890
is unrealistic.

762
00:55:30,757 --> 00:55:32,622
The second question.

763
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:35,598
lf Vice President Li
replaced President Chiang,

764
00:55:35,683 --> 00:55:38,516
will things get better?

765
00:55:41,301 --> 00:55:42,290
ln terms of warfare,

766
00:55:43,231 --> 00:55:46,200
Bai Chongxi is quite capable.

767
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:48,975
ln terms of politics,

768
00:55:49,117 --> 00:55:53,747
Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi
together are no match for Chiang.

769
00:55:53,861 --> 00:55:57,763
You did not answer my question, sir.

770
00:56:40,925 --> 00:56:41,857
Here.

771
00:57:04,039 --> 00:57:07,816
What are you looking at?

772
00:57:07,832 --> 00:57:08,787
Jinzhou.

773
00:57:10,541 --> 00:57:11,712
That's over 1,000 km away.

774
00:57:11,722 --> 00:57:14,577
More definite news won't
arrive until tomorrow.

775
00:57:17,387 --> 00:57:20,231
lt's already 10:30 and yet no sign
of attack. Which division was it?

776
00:57:20,249 --> 00:57:23,980
The 8th column.

777
00:57:23,994 --> 00:57:25,916
You asked me 5 times already.

778
00:57:27,029 --> 00:57:27,950
Really?

779
00:57:30,707 --> 00:57:34,632
The Battle of Jinzhou is not
just over a city or a region.

780
00:57:34,644 --> 00:57:36,646
lf we win, we can go on.

781
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:41,279
lf we lose, the situation gets complicated.

782
00:57:46,148 --> 00:57:50,016
With regards to the draft
agenda of the CPPCC,

783
00:57:50,028 --> 00:57:53,862
Zhang Lan and Shen Junru
made minor changes.

784
00:57:54,791 --> 00:57:58,591
They know we're at war.

785
00:57:58,603 --> 00:58:01,470
They're being very understanding.

786
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:04,369
Zhang Lan is sick.

787
00:58:04,384 --> 00:58:07,285
We should postpone his trip up north.

788
00:58:09,147 --> 00:58:13,106
We must invite him.

789
00:58:13,123 --> 00:58:15,921
But we'll let him decide

790
00:58:15,936 --> 00:58:17,949
when to come.

791
00:58:20,642 --> 00:58:20,846
We'll wait.

792
00:58:25,645 --> 00:58:29,342
Aunt, he has full authority

793
00:58:29,352 --> 00:58:32,321
to seize everything owned
by the Yangtze Company.

794
00:58:32,338 --> 00:58:35,080
He put out word all over
Shanghai looking for me.

795
00:58:36,016 --> 00:58:38,883
Now l finally see him.

796
00:58:38,897 --> 00:58:40,945
That ought to save him some trouble.

797
00:58:40,952 --> 00:58:43,750
Have you gone mad, David?

798
00:58:43,881 --> 00:58:49,547
Relax. He's the Liaison
Administrator, the prince.

799
00:58:49,556 --> 00:58:52,343
l wouldn't dare shoot the prince.

800
00:58:53,378 --> 00:58:55,369
This is very simple, cousin.

801
00:58:55,385 --> 00:58:58,081
Shoot me and it's all over.

802
00:58:58,093 --> 00:59:00,994
With the culprit dead, you'll
be famous in Shanghai.

803
00:59:01,003 --> 00:59:03,039
We'll both get what we want.

804
00:59:06,736 --> 00:59:07,737
Ching-kuo.

805
00:59:13,631 --> 00:59:16,452
lt's clearly written in the state papers.

806
00:59:16,464 --> 00:59:19,410
You're needed for
questioning within 10 days

807
00:59:19,421 --> 00:59:21,309
or you'll be severely punished.

808
00:59:21,323 --> 00:59:24,110
7 days have gone by, you
decide what to do next.

809
00:59:25,068 --> 00:59:26,945
Yangtze Company is our family estate.

810
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:28,018
l dare you to arrest my father.

811
00:59:28,035 --> 00:59:30,788
Nonsense. lt's clearly your fault.

812
00:59:30,801 --> 00:59:32,666
Leave your father out of this.

813
00:59:33,701 --> 00:59:36,602
lf he and Ai-ling found out
about your monkey business,

814
00:59:36,611 --> 00:59:38,454
they won't spare you.

815
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:41,418
This is how we do business in Shanghai.

816
00:59:41,431 --> 00:59:44,173
But the arrival of a Liaison
Administrator changed all that.

817
00:59:45,148 --> 00:59:48,197
Auntie, everyone does it. That's the rule.

818
00:59:48,211 --> 00:59:50,088
Only a feudalistic dictator

819
00:59:50,103 --> 00:59:52,048
would run a business without rules.

820
00:59:52,955 --> 00:59:54,832
Who are you calling a dictator?

821
01:00:01,511 --> 01:00:05,356
The government is fighting a war and
soldiers are dying on the front.

822
01:00:05,371 --> 01:00:09,205
But the state treasury is empty and
we had to borrow from the Americans.

823
01:00:09,212 --> 01:00:11,168
Currency has depreciated and
prices have skyrocketed.

824
01:00:11,181 --> 01:00:13,092
People are running scared.

825
01:00:14,081 --> 01:00:15,912
But inside your godowns,

826
01:00:15,925 --> 01:00:17,916
you hoarded over 100
thousand tons of supplies

827
01:00:17,932 --> 01:00:19,718
which you are unwilling to sell.

828
01:00:20,755 --> 01:00:22,803
l'm a businessman, not a philanthropist.

829
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,524
The CPC is working on land reforms
and political consultation.

830
01:00:27,592 --> 01:00:30,481
Even Cai Tingkai and Shen Junru
have left for the Northeast.

831
01:00:30,492 --> 01:00:34,292
Mao is setting up his own government.

832
01:00:39,097 --> 01:00:43,750
Madame, you've always
supported Father.

833
01:00:43,764 --> 01:00:45,823
l bet you never expected

834
01:00:45,838 --> 01:00:50,593
right here in Shanghai,

835
01:00:54,365 --> 01:00:57,243
someone is undermining him,

836
01:00:57,256 --> 01:01:00,999
destroying the foundation of this country.

837
01:01:01,011 --> 01:01:03,104
Their fortune, apartments,

838
01:01:03,114 --> 01:01:07,722
clothes, perfumes and
iceboxes are like a virus

839
01:01:07,733 --> 01:01:10,725
residing on the mere
skeleton of this country.

840
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:15,599
They are the enemy,
Father's and the state's.

841
01:01:15,607 --> 01:01:18,417
That's enough,

842
01:01:20,274 --> 01:01:22,253
Ching-kuo.

843
01:01:22,262 --> 01:01:25,174
There are no enemies here, only family.

844
01:01:27,130 --> 01:01:33,865
Let's talk about family today.

845
01:01:37,430 --> 01:01:39,341
l'm not in the position to say anything.

846
01:01:40,253 --> 01:01:43,074
He Yingqin is the Director
of National Defense.

847
01:01:43,084 --> 01:01:46,053
Take pains to stay save.
Let Chiang talk to him.

848
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,673
You're a better marksman
than He Yingqin.

849
01:01:54,661 --> 01:01:56,583
So what?

850
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,407
Chiang owns China now.

851
01:02:00,420 --> 01:02:04,277
Even this gun has his
name engraved on it.

852
01:02:04,288 --> 01:02:06,176
What can we do about it?

853
01:02:08,233 --> 01:02:13,876
The CPC troops use this type of rifle too.

854
01:02:13,887 --> 01:02:16,720
What matters is not the name on the rifle,

855
01:02:16,738 --> 01:02:17,807
but the man who uses it.

856
01:02:22,545 --> 01:02:24,365
Holding a rifle

857
01:02:24,379 --> 01:02:28,201
beats holding an empty title of
Director of National Defense.

858
01:02:30,234 --> 01:02:34,944
lf you're the President,

859
01:02:34,957 --> 01:02:36,913
will the Americans back us up?

860
01:02:41,724 --> 01:02:44,568
Stuart dropped a hint.

861
01:02:49,480 --> 01:02:54,224
Then let's get rid of Chiang.

862
01:02:54,241 --> 01:02:56,141
lt's still too early to say.

863
01:03:00,816 --> 01:03:02,920
Never too early to take precautions.

864
01:03:02,928 --> 01:03:05,670
lt's time we get started.

865
01:03:10,607 --> 01:03:16,261
Ching-kuo, Madam is leaving
for the US tomorrow

866
01:03:18,113 --> 01:03:21,105
to ask President Truman for help.

867
01:03:22,116 --> 01:03:24,949
The situation in the Northeast
is deteriorating quickly.

868
01:03:25,898 --> 01:03:28,719
We need help from the Americans.

869
01:03:30,611 --> 01:03:32,670
l flew back from the Northeast

870
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:35,465
just to tell you,

871
01:03:37,369 --> 01:03:39,348
at a time like this

872
01:03:43,147 --> 01:03:45,172
we can't afford a fire in the backyard.

873
01:03:45,182 --> 01:03:47,867
Father.

874
01:03:47,995 --> 01:03:51,795
lf we don't punish the Kung's,

875
01:03:51,805 --> 01:03:54,626
the economy in Shanghai is doomed.

876
01:03:57,622 --> 01:04:00,352
l absolutely understand.

877
01:04:01,414 --> 01:04:06,101
The corruption of the
KMT is in the bones.

878
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,047
lt's not just the problem of the Kung's.

879
01:04:11,061 --> 01:04:13,905
Crackdown on corruption
is a major issue.

880
01:04:13,921 --> 01:04:18,597
Timing and extent are crucial...

881
01:04:18,615 --> 01:04:19,695
it's tough.

882
01:04:20,708 --> 01:04:23,541
You lose the Party if you proceed.

883
01:04:23,558 --> 01:04:27,255
You lose the country if you don't.

884
01:04:30,230 --> 01:04:32,027
lt's tough.

885
01:04:33,081 --> 01:04:34,981
Father.

886
01:04:34,991 --> 01:04:39,724
Both the Party and the country
are on the brink of disaster.

887
01:04:39,781 --> 01:04:40,816
Alright.

888
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:49,405
The matter at hand

889
01:04:51,251 --> 01:04:55,130
is to move the troops up North
to south of the Yangtze River

890
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,028
to ensure the safety there.

891
01:04:59,094 --> 01:05:01,938
Going after the Kung's

892
01:05:01,954 --> 01:05:04,775
is meaningless now.

893
01:05:12,330 --> 01:05:16,278
Zhang Lan is truly a saint of Sichuan.

894
01:05:16,295 --> 01:05:18,081
He deserves it.

895
01:05:19,146 --> 01:05:23,059
Without him at the CPPCC,

896
01:05:23,072 --> 01:05:25,927
none of us Sichuanese

897
01:05:25,942 --> 01:05:28,775
would dare to go.

898
01:05:29,685 --> 01:05:32,620
The Northeast is too
cold for a man his age.

899
01:05:33,611 --> 01:05:36,330
He probably can't make it.

900
01:05:36,337 --> 01:05:38,237
lf anything happens to him...

901
01:05:40,186 --> 01:05:41,255
What about Beiping?

902
01:05:42,193 --> 01:05:43,171
What?

903
01:05:45,072 --> 01:05:46,994
Postpone the meeting till next year.

904
01:05:47,011 --> 01:05:49,844
Move the venue to Beiping.

905
01:05:49,852 --> 01:05:50,853
lt's possible.

906
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:54,751
The troops are tired
after taking Shenyang.

907
01:05:54,767 --> 01:05:56,644
Fu Zuoyi commands 600,000 men.

908
01:05:56,658 --> 01:05:58,467
Relying on 2 divisions in the
Shanxi-Chahar-Hebei Border Region

909
01:05:58,482 --> 01:06:01,258
to capture Beiping is impossible.

910
01:06:01,275 --> 01:06:02,435
According to our intelligence

911
01:06:02,446 --> 01:06:05,165
lately, Fu Zuoyi is
having second thoughts.

912
01:06:05,182 --> 01:06:07,104
After the failed attempt on Shijiazhuang,

913
01:06:07,121 --> 01:06:09,897
he seems willing to negotiate.

914
01:06:10,874 --> 01:06:12,853
Send someone reliable to liaise with him.

915
01:06:12,871 --> 01:06:13,803
Ok.

916
01:06:14,762 --> 01:06:19,597
lt'd be heavenly, if we can
liberate Beiping peacefully.

917
01:06:19,609 --> 01:06:22,419
Fu's daughter Dongju is a Party member.

918
01:06:22,431 --> 01:06:23,534
She's perfect for the job.

919
01:06:23,545 --> 01:06:24,500
Yes.

920
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:29,238
ln that case, l'll be the
dictator for a change.

921
01:06:30,120 --> 01:06:33,123
Ask the Northeast Field Army to enter
the Shanhai Pass within 7 days.

922
01:06:33,134 --> 01:06:34,931
Tell Lin Biao

923
01:06:34,948 --> 01:06:36,882
this is an order and not a probe.

924
01:06:40,842 --> 01:06:44,608
lt'll take a few days
to gather up the troops

925
01:06:44,614 --> 01:06:48,414
and each column needs
time to adjust otherwise.

926
01:06:48,425 --> 01:06:51,292
Moving inside the Pass
will be a problem.

927
01:06:51,304 --> 01:06:56,071
The cadres don't want to make the move

928
01:06:56,085 --> 01:06:59,031
and it'll take time for deployment.

929
01:06:59,041 --> 01:07:03,717
The deadline on the 22nd is too tight.

930
01:07:05,597 --> 01:07:10,421
Wire this back: Received order
dispatched on 18th at 18:00.

931
01:07:10,435 --> 01:07:14,280
Will set out on the 22nd as instructed.

932
01:07:15,302 --> 01:07:19,147
Details to follow. Signed, Lin, Luo & Liu.

933
01:07:45,020 --> 01:07:48,023
You should think for yourself too.

934
01:07:49,800 --> 01:07:51,654
You really want me

935
01:07:51,662 --> 01:07:54,620
to hold the horsewhip for your Chairman?

936
01:07:56,539 --> 01:08:00,361
Forget it, Father. lt was a joke.

937
01:08:00,378 --> 01:08:01,322
A joke?

938
01:08:01,338 --> 01:08:03,363
l personally told the American reporter.

939
01:08:03,373 --> 01:08:06,137
lt's not a joke.

940
01:08:06,147 --> 01:08:08,069
That's because you took it to heart.

941
01:08:10,927 --> 01:08:14,784
Li Jishen is a founding member of the
Party who opposes Chiang openly.

942
01:08:14,796 --> 01:08:15,717
Over these last few months,

943
01:08:15,727 --> 01:08:18,685
Mao has repeatedly invited him up north.

944
01:08:18,702 --> 01:08:22,365
He's been stalling him.
He's bewildered by

945
01:08:28,215 --> 01:08:29,307
You come to see me

946
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:35,857
with a 18-year old newspaper.

947
01:08:36,969 --> 01:08:38,891
How kind of you.

948
01:08:38,908 --> 01:08:41,559
The quarrel between
you and the President

949
01:08:41,577 --> 01:08:44,478
should stay within the Party.

950
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,543
Between you and the CPC,

951
01:08:47,384 --> 01:08:51,366
don't forget you ordered the
execution of Cai Hesen.

952
01:08:57,002 --> 01:08:58,014
What are you saying?

953
01:08:59,853 --> 01:09:03,812
Return to Nanjing and
pick any job you want,

954
01:09:03,827 --> 01:09:05,670
as long as you don't join the CPC.

955
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:07,590
A promotion for a promise?

956
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:15,159
You think l'll go?

957
01:09:15,173 --> 01:09:19,018
Before l came, Vice President Li told me

958
01:09:19,031 --> 01:09:22,876
he would like to liaise
with the CPC through you.

959
01:09:24,023 --> 01:09:27,789
Any condition is negotiable,

960
01:09:29,734 --> 01:09:34,410
including using the
Yangtze as a partition.

961
01:09:40,235 --> 01:09:42,032
Use the Yangtze as a partition

962
01:09:44,008 --> 01:09:45,885
and split up China?

963
01:09:46,043 --> 01:09:47,943
Tell Li Zongren.

964
01:09:47,953 --> 01:09:51,719
The infamy is more than he can handle.

965
01:10:21,587 --> 01:10:22,519
Hello, Mr. President.

966
01:10:23,363 --> 01:10:24,364
Commander Fu.

967
01:10:28,201 --> 01:10:32,160
Our troops can pull back
to Tanggu and Zhangjiakou.

968
01:10:32,175 --> 01:10:33,972
l can't guarantee we'll win.

969
01:10:33,989 --> 01:10:35,923
But we're perfectly capable of defense.

970
01:10:37,905 --> 01:10:40,635
With the big picture in mind.

971
01:10:40,651 --> 01:10:45,577
l intend to move 600,000
men to Jiangnan.

972
01:10:45,594 --> 01:10:50,315
l can be more flexible in
both defense and offense.

973
01:10:50,326 --> 01:10:52,203
That's containing our
sovereignty to the southeast.

974
01:10:52,217 --> 01:10:55,118
As the old capital, Beiping
has political significance.

975
01:10:55,126 --> 01:10:57,003
Giving it up

976
01:10:57,996 --> 01:11:00,897
is unfavorable to our
government internationally.

977
01:11:05,627 --> 01:11:11,452
You're right. lnternational
scope is the situation.

978
01:11:35,508 --> 01:11:37,282
Wait.

979
01:11:42,036 --> 01:11:46,063
What is it, Father?

980
01:11:50,723 --> 01:11:53,544
Who's your commanding officer?

981
01:11:56,549 --> 01:12:00,258
We agreed not to discuss that.

982
01:12:00,494 --> 01:12:04,203
l wish to talk to them.

983
01:12:04,219 --> 01:12:06,995
About what? The horsewhip?

984
01:12:07,002 --> 01:12:10,984
What l'm telling you now

985
01:12:10,995 --> 01:12:13,919
will determine the lives of millions.

986
01:12:17,628 --> 01:12:19,482
l understand.

987
01:12:46,387 --> 01:12:48,446
She's so hot.

988
01:12:51,215 --> 01:12:52,216
l'm sorry, May-ling.

989
01:12:52,232 --> 01:12:54,177
Both the House and the Congress

990
01:12:54,190 --> 01:12:57,956
have refused your request
to make another speech.

991
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:02,686
But the Government will still
support the General as before

992
01:13:02,695 --> 01:13:06,631
with the hope that the civil war does
not continue any longer in China.

993
01:13:06,698 --> 01:13:12,375
President Truman and his administration
is concentrating on Europe.

994
01:13:13,321 --> 01:13:16,119
But the East needs a revival too.

995
01:13:18,111 --> 01:13:19,089
My friend.

996
01:13:19,100 --> 01:13:21,887
China should have been
included in your plan.

997
01:13:22,008 --> 01:13:24,886
Any loans and assistance
from the US now

998
01:13:24,897 --> 01:13:28,708
should be spent on security
and constructive activities,

999
01:13:28,718 --> 01:13:29,696
not war.

1000
01:13:30,532 --> 01:13:35,333
You got 400 million dollars
from the original loan.

1001
01:13:35,341 --> 01:13:36,444
That's still in existence.

1002
01:13:36,454 --> 01:13:38,376
We both know there's only a
few million dollars left.

1003
01:13:38,393 --> 01:13:41,271
And it's not enough to support
my husband's administration

1004
01:13:41,283 --> 01:13:43,194
and his life's work.

1005
01:13:45,074 --> 01:13:47,838
Mr. Secretary of State,

1006
01:13:47,848 --> 01:13:50,749
we need your additional assistance,

1007
01:13:50,757 --> 01:13:51,769
please.

1008
01:13:51,784 --> 01:13:54,708
Madam, there's nothing more we can do.

1009
01:15:25,690 --> 01:15:26,816
New Year is coming up.

1010
01:15:28,665 --> 01:15:33,511
Make this announcement at month end.

1011
01:15:33,522 --> 01:15:35,387
About what?

1012
01:15:35,404 --> 01:15:39,295
lf they want me to resign, l'll resign.

1013
01:15:40,098 --> 01:15:41,167
You can't do that, Mr. President.

1014
01:15:41,182 --> 01:15:43,082
lt's not my choice.

1015
01:15:44,043 --> 01:15:46,955
But someone within our
Party wants me out.

1016
01:15:56,454 --> 01:16:00,390
You repeatedly rejected Mao
and Zhou's invitation.

1017
01:16:00,399 --> 01:16:03,300
You're too arrogant.

1018
01:16:03,308 --> 01:16:06,027
That's an overstatement, Madame Liao.

1019
01:16:06,034 --> 01:16:07,990
l'm tied up at home.

1020
01:16:08,002 --> 01:16:10,994
And l'm also busy with military affairs.

1021
01:16:11,006 --> 01:16:14,681
Preparations for the new CPPCC are
moving along and days are counting.

1022
01:16:14,692 --> 01:16:19,459
After decades, the KMT can't be absent.

1023
01:16:19,472 --> 01:16:21,428
You're still hesitant about going.

1024
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:25,251
You expect Mao to fly to
Nanjing to invite Chiang?

1025
01:16:25,260 --> 01:16:28,093
We're definitely not inviting him.

1026
01:16:28,111 --> 01:16:30,090
He's a war criminal, a murderer.

1027
01:16:31,029 --> 01:16:34,044
We can't have a CPPCC
without the KMT.

1028
01:16:35,013 --> 01:16:39,586
Jishen, Chairman Mao said

1029
01:16:39,601 --> 01:16:41,580
he'd wait for you in Beiping.

1030
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:00,906
Chief, some landlord's
compound up ahead.

1031
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:02,808
The wall is too high for us to climb over.

1032
01:17:02,821 --> 01:17:06,564
Grenades won't blow it apart.
Please send for the artillery.

1033
01:17:16,182 --> 01:17:17,114
Flare.

1034
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,997
Flare.

1035
01:17:41,063 --> 01:17:44,021
Commander...

1036
01:17:44,029 --> 01:17:46,930
we have reached Beiping city.

1037
01:17:53,580 --> 01:17:56,606
2 pieces of good news, sir.

1038
01:17:57,534 --> 01:18:01,277
Li Jishen, Shen Yanbing
and Zhang Naiqi

1039
01:18:01,288 --> 01:18:02,334
left 4 days ago.

1040
01:18:02,343 --> 01:18:06,109
They boarded the Aldan and will
disembark at Dalian day after tomorrow.

1041
01:18:07,057 --> 01:18:10,902
And the other one?

1042
01:18:11,894 --> 01:18:14,613
Chiang Kai-shek resigned.

1043
01:18:27,147 --> 01:18:28,182
Mr. Ambassador.

1044
01:18:28,193 --> 01:18:30,081
As China's ally,

1045
01:18:30,094 --> 01:18:34,007
why is the US doing nothing
at a time like this?

1046
01:18:37,773 --> 01:18:41,652
God help those who help
themselves, my friend.

1047
01:18:45,481 --> 01:18:49,292
l think Chiang is giving
Li Zongren a hard time.

1048
01:18:49,301 --> 01:18:54,000
He knows Li wants to negotiate,
so he brought it up first.

1049
01:18:54,014 --> 01:18:58,804
He doesn't want Li to get the credit

1050
01:18:58,814 --> 01:19:01,817
and he wants to give us a hard time.

1051
01:19:02,730 --> 01:19:06,643
He already stepped down, but he
had to pull a stunt like this.

1052
01:19:06,656 --> 01:19:08,453
After this,

1053
01:19:08,461 --> 01:19:12,227
it would be tough for Li to talk to us.

1054
01:19:12,233 --> 01:19:13,291
The CDL and the other Parties

1055
01:19:13,308 --> 01:19:16,209
have yet to make a stand,
they're waiting to see.

1056
01:19:16,216 --> 01:19:17,217
ln my opinion,

1057
01:19:17,234 --> 01:19:18,997
deep down

1058
01:19:19,010 --> 01:19:20,910
they want us to talk.

1059
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:23,946
Li Zongren wants peace, we want peace,

1060
01:19:23,963 --> 01:19:26,682
the other Parties want peace.

1061
01:19:26,689 --> 01:19:29,692
We'll do the Acting President a favor.

1062
01:19:29,703 --> 01:19:31,500
Great.

1063
01:19:31,508 --> 01:19:34,420
Let's give him a chance to talk,

1064
01:19:34,435 --> 01:19:38,132
but we decide how.

1065
01:19:58,471 --> 01:20:03,295
Victory bulletin...

1066
01:20:06,083 --> 01:20:07,948
War communique from Huaihai.

1067
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:12,902
According to the wire,

1068
01:20:12,917 --> 01:20:16,535
550,000 enemies were killed
and Du Yuming was captured.

1069
01:20:17,515 --> 01:20:18,595
What about the New 5th and the 18th?

1070
01:20:18,609 --> 01:20:19,587
Gone.

1071
01:20:19,598 --> 01:20:21,543
The 5 major divisions were wiped out.

1072
01:20:21,556 --> 01:20:25,196
Chiang is finished for good.

1073
01:20:31,980 --> 01:20:35,893
There'll be no more fighting
north of the Yangtze.

1074
01:20:57,880 --> 01:21:00,713
Cheers.

1075
01:21:30,362 --> 01:21:35,322
This is the last battle.

1076
01:21:35,331 --> 01:21:40,963
We stay united till tomorrow.

1077
01:21:40,972 --> 01:21:46,865
"lnternationale''

1078
01:21:46,881 --> 01:21:52,581
will come true.

1079
01:21:52,598 --> 01:21:58,343
This is the last battle.

1080
01:21:58,354 --> 01:22:04,042
We stay united till tomorrow.

1081
01:22:04,052 --> 01:22:16,499
"lnternationale'' will come true.

1082
01:23:37,322 --> 01:23:46,953
Father, it's cold on the ground.

1083
01:23:46,953 --> 01:23:48,762
Sit down.

1084
01:23:54,580 --> 01:23:55,638
Ching-kuo.

1085
01:23:56,584 --> 01:24:08,931
You did a good job in
Shanghai. l'm very pleased.

1086
01:24:08,931 --> 01:24:13,679
l made Chen Cheng Governor of Taiwan.

1087
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:15,704
Do you know why?

1088
01:24:17,670 --> 01:24:21,333
Your route of retreat?

1089
01:24:22,370 --> 01:24:28,279
Yes, Du Yuming's men were wiped out.

1090
01:24:28,279 --> 01:24:31,963
l lost all the men who can fight.

1091
01:24:31,715 --> 01:24:36,436
We can't count on the 1 million
men we captured in Jiangnan.

1092
01:24:36,692 --> 01:24:40,702
They can barely hold their rifles.

1093
01:24:40,702 --> 01:24:46,277
The Yangtze is lost.

1094
01:24:48,233 --> 01:24:52,127
You intend to evacuate to Taiwan?

1095
01:24:52,127 --> 01:24:53,947
You're coming too.

1096
01:24:59,888 --> 01:25:04,540
You think Li Zongren won't get anywhere

1097
01:25:04,540 --> 01:25:06,517
with the CPC over the
peace negotiations?

1098
01:25:06,517 --> 01:25:08,451
lf we can't defeat them at war,

1099
01:25:08,416 --> 01:25:11,970
we won't beat them at
the conference table.

1100
01:25:12,253 --> 01:25:14,162
Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi thought

1101
01:25:14,162 --> 01:25:18,038
the CPC will settle for using
the Yangtze as a partition.

1102
01:25:18,038 --> 01:25:20,973
They don't know Mao Zedong.

1103
01:25:20,973 --> 01:25:23,771
Mao will never agree to

1104
01:25:23,784 --> 01:25:25,760
separate governments on
both sides of the Yangtze?

1105
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:32,436
Would you accept if it were you?

1106
01:25:32,436 --> 01:25:35,286
That'd depend on the US and the USSR...

1107
01:25:35,286 --> 01:25:39,257
Don't make it so complicated. lt
doesn't matter what anyone thinks.

1108
01:25:39,257 --> 01:25:42,096
China was split into north
and south in the past

1109
01:25:42,096 --> 01:25:44,894
but not today.

1110
01:25:44,907 --> 01:25:46,941
Who would want to be blamed for it?

1111
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:49,762
Definitely not me.

1112
01:25:51,709 --> 01:25:53,563
Mr. Zhang Lan.

1113
01:25:53,579 --> 01:25:55,410
Right now, in your opinion,

1114
01:25:55,421 --> 01:25:58,433
will the CPC accept the
Government's plea for peace?

1115
01:25:58,433 --> 01:26:00,344
lmpossible.

1116
01:26:00,361 --> 01:26:02,215
Why is that?

1117
01:26:02,222 --> 01:26:05,043
lf Chiang never gives up his
so-called constitution,

1118
01:26:05,043 --> 01:26:06,886
The CPC will not recognize it

1119
01:26:06,894 --> 01:26:08,987
and neither will the people.

1120
01:26:08,995 --> 01:26:11,834
You know Mao Zedong and
Zhou Enlai very well.

1121
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:14,723
Are they local revolutionaries

1122
01:26:14,741 --> 01:26:18,434
or mere agents working for international
communist intelligence bureau?

1123
01:26:18,486 --> 01:26:21,589
What kind of question is that?

1124
01:26:21,446 --> 01:26:26,110
l want to know your view.

1125
01:26:26,128 --> 01:26:29,994
My view is that the CPC
catered for the people

1126
01:26:29,994 --> 01:26:33,812
which explains their achievements today.

1127
01:26:33,812 --> 01:26:35,643
Achievements?

1128
01:26:35,654 --> 01:26:37,633
Yes, achievements.

1129
01:26:40,479 --> 01:26:41,594
Dear Zuoyi.

1130
01:26:41,611 --> 01:26:44,479
You and l have come a long way.

1131
01:26:44,479 --> 01:26:47,347
Given the circumstances, you took
matters into your own hands.

1132
01:26:47,347 --> 01:26:51,146
There's nothing l can do about
that, but l have one request.

1133
01:26:51,146 --> 01:26:53,976
l will send planes to Beiping tomorrow

1134
01:26:53,976 --> 01:26:56,758
to airlift officers of the 13th
Army ranked Major or above

1135
01:26:56,758 --> 01:26:57,725
and essential weaponry.

1136
01:26:58,734 --> 01:27:02,571
On account of our long standing
friendship, please help me out.

1137
01:27:02,571 --> 01:27:04,425
Chiang Chung-cheng .

1138
01:27:41,086 --> 01:27:42,976
Beiping fell. Fu Zuoyi surrendered.

1139
01:27:42,976 --> 01:27:45,797
The CPC is moving in on
the Yangtze and Nanjing.

1140
01:27:45,797 --> 01:27:48,665
With regards to my plea for peace,

1141
01:27:48,665 --> 01:27:49,643
the CPC accepted it

1142
01:27:49,653 --> 01:27:55,265
but raised 8 very harsh conditions.

1143
01:27:55,265 --> 01:27:59,131
Madame, if you speak on
behalf of the Government,

1144
01:27:59,131 --> 01:28:02,077
Mao and Zhou may trust me.

1145
01:28:06,018 --> 01:28:08,743
As you know, Mr. Acting President,

1146
01:28:08,743 --> 01:28:14,546
l washed my hands in politics
since the onset of the civil war.

1147
01:28:14,546 --> 01:28:18,374
There are rumors in the newspapers
about me coming out of retirement.

1148
01:28:18,374 --> 01:28:20,341
The Trust had to issue a denial.

1149
01:28:20,341 --> 01:28:22,115
Madame.

1150
01:28:24,082 --> 01:28:27,074
Dr. Sun founded the KMT.

1151
01:28:27,084 --> 01:28:31,714
You can't sit back and

1152
01:28:31,727 --> 01:28:32,864
watch it go to ruin.

1153
01:28:51,987 --> 01:28:57,839
Don't forget, you may be
the Acting President,

1154
01:28:57,839 --> 01:29:15,902
but Chiang Kai-shek is
still the Party Chairman.

1155
01:29:15,902 --> 01:29:20,728
Looks like the Acting President
is having a hard time.

1156
01:29:20,728 --> 01:29:24,632
Chiang stepped down in name only.

1157
01:29:24,632 --> 01:29:28,316
He still has control of everything.

1158
01:29:28,316 --> 01:29:30,436
Li Zongren does not
have enough authority.

1159
01:29:30,436 --> 01:29:33,280
He's only a puppet.

1160
01:29:33,294 --> 01:29:38,072
Nothing will come out of the negotiation.

1161
01:29:38,072 --> 01:29:42,762
No wonder you turned him down.

1162
01:29:42,762 --> 01:29:44,730
l don't want to go to Beiping

1163
01:29:47,521 --> 01:30:00,097
because Dr. Sun died
there. Too many memories.

1164
01:30:00,097 --> 01:30:03,061
Master Zhang, you're a
veteran of the United League

1165
01:30:03,061 --> 01:30:04,915
and Zhu De's mentor.

1166
01:30:04,932 --> 01:30:07,867
Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu
have great respect for you.

1167
01:30:07,919 --> 01:30:10,361
The Acting President issued a
declaration for peace negotiation.

1168
01:30:10,716 --> 01:30:16,280
You're the most suitable
person to mediate.

1169
01:30:16,280 --> 01:30:19,235
lf the CPC brought up 8 conditions,

1170
01:30:19,235 --> 01:30:21,135
go ahead and talk to them.

1171
01:30:24,156 --> 01:30:26,056
lf Mao wants to talk,

1172
01:30:26,065 --> 01:30:28,780
he wouldn't raise these harsh conditions.

1173
01:30:28,780 --> 01:30:33,634
There should be room to
negotiate in a negotiation.

1174
01:30:33,634 --> 01:30:39,341
That's why the Acting President
sent me to haggle with them.

1175
01:30:39,341 --> 01:30:40,444
To mediate.

1176
01:30:43,140 --> 01:30:47,035
As you know, the Government
clamped down on the CDL.

1177
01:30:47,035 --> 01:30:50,834
[ Skipped item nr. 334 ]

1178
01:30:50,834 --> 01:30:53,740
l'm now in the same party
as the Communists.

1179
01:30:53,740 --> 01:30:56,720
Please don't be upset, sir.

1180
01:30:56,733 --> 01:30:58,564
Mr. Chiang issued that order,

1181
01:30:58,575 --> 01:31:00,531
not the Acting President.

1182
01:31:00,542 --> 01:31:03,431
l side with the revolutionary.

1183
01:31:03,448 --> 01:31:05,404
l won't haggle for the enemy.

1184
01:31:05,415 --> 01:31:07,155
Sir.

1185
01:31:07,170 --> 01:31:08,285
See them out.

1186
01:31:17,601 --> 01:31:23,221
A partitioned rule? China is not Korea.

1187
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:27,277
The Yangtze is not the 38th Parallel.

1188
01:31:27,277 --> 01:31:30,241
Wire the General Front Committee.

1189
01:31:30,241 --> 01:31:33,205
Their war plan has been approved.

1190
01:31:33,205 --> 01:31:39,767
The central government advises to
move the plan up to end of April.

1191
01:31:39,767 --> 01:31:40,859
Go

1192
01:31:44,573 --> 01:31:46,621
Hurry. Are you ok?

1193
01:32:49,958 --> 01:32:52,722
Don't push

1194
01:33:17,787 --> 01:33:20,620
Lin Biao is still so skinny.

1195
01:33:20,636 --> 01:33:22,602
Eating 1 million Nationalist soldiers

1196
01:33:22,602 --> 01:33:25,435
didn't even make him fat.

1197
01:33:32,176 --> 01:33:33,928
Comrades.

1198
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:37,893
On behalf of the Secretariat of the
Central Politburo, l hereby announce

1199
01:33:37,945 --> 01:33:41,376
the commencement of
the second meeting

1200
01:33:41,635 --> 01:34:07,641
of the 7th CPC Central Committee.

1201
01:34:07,641 --> 01:34:11,382
What should we do about Zhang Lan?

1202
01:34:11,382 --> 01:34:13,397
He'd rather die than go to Taiwan.

1203
01:34:13,397 --> 01:34:15,285
He's trouble to us if he stays.

1204
01:34:24,870 --> 01:34:26,792
Give him what he wants.

1205
01:34:45,974 --> 01:34:47,009
Sir.

1206
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:54,473
Get rid of Zhang Lan.

1207
01:34:59,490 --> 01:35:04,280
He's a man of influence, sir.

1208
01:35:04,287 --> 01:35:07,069
The more reason to get rid of him.

1209
01:35:07,069 --> 01:35:08,957
l see.

1210
01:35:08,968 --> 01:35:11,903
Openly or privately?

1211
01:35:11,913 --> 01:35:14,734
How can you do this openly?

1212
01:35:14,743 --> 01:35:17,631
Like l said, don't let me see him alive.

1213
01:35:17,631 --> 01:35:19,553
And no body if he's dead.

1214
01:35:19,568 --> 01:35:21,388
Don't make a mess.

1215
01:35:22,379 --> 01:35:24,267
l understand.

1216
01:35:24,278 --> 01:35:25,336
Go on.

1217
01:35:27,137 --> 01:35:29,002
Take care.

1218
01:36:32,426 --> 01:36:33,290
Stop.

1219
01:36:36,378 --> 01:36:38,107
Get out.

1220
01:36:46,796 --> 01:36:48,661
Are you Zhang Lan?

1221
01:36:49,597 --> 01:36:50,712
Who are you?

1222
01:36:53,607 --> 01:36:55,438
What do you want?

1223
01:36:56,370 --> 01:37:02,183
Deputy Chief Yan Jinwen of
the Shanghai lnspectorate.

1224
01:37:02,183 --> 01:37:06,941
On behalf of the CPC, l will get you out.

1225
01:37:06,941 --> 01:37:10,729
Trust me.

1226
01:37:47,337 --> 01:37:48,269
Brother Yan.

1227
01:37:48,287 --> 01:37:50,152
Morning, you're on duty?

1228
01:37:51,030 --> 01:37:54,033
Security has been tightened lately.

1229
01:37:54,033 --> 01:37:55,819
Where are you going?

1230
01:37:56,786 --> 01:37:58,686
On lnspectorate business.

1231
01:37:58,695 --> 01:38:05,592
Mixing pleasure with business.
My father is in the car.

1232
01:38:05,644 --> 01:38:11,008
Go ahead, do what you have to.

1233
01:38:11,300 --> 01:38:13,131
No need, run along.

1234
01:38:15,051 --> 01:38:16,905
Bye.

1235
01:38:17,104 --> 01:38:19,925
Let them through.

1236
01:38:38,016 --> 01:38:39,995
Where are you taking us?

1237
01:38:40,999 --> 01:38:42,011
Up north.

1238
01:38:50,554 --> 01:38:52,522
Enlai, where's the Chairman?

1239
01:38:52,530 --> 01:38:54,384
Went to get smokes.

1240
01:38:54,391 --> 01:38:59,255
Not a shop is open in two blocks.

1241
01:38:59,255 --> 01:39:02,948
Chengjun, you're the county
committee secretary.

1242
01:39:02,948 --> 01:39:03,937
This can't go on.

1243
01:39:04,089 --> 01:39:06,987
After entering the city, rumor has it

1244
01:39:06,987 --> 01:39:10,747
capitalists and businessmen
are exploiters

1245
01:39:10,747 --> 01:39:12,533
and we should punish them.

1246
01:39:12,713 --> 01:39:17,404
They're so scared no one
is open for business.

1247
01:39:17,404 --> 01:39:19,440
This is not a small matter.

1248
01:39:19,457 --> 01:39:23,143
Revolution is our forte

1249
01:39:23,160 --> 01:39:26,948
but not economics.

1250
01:39:26,959 --> 01:39:29,818
Can't even get smokes
without the merchants,

1251
01:39:29,818 --> 01:39:31,786
let alone market prosperity.

1252
01:39:31,803 --> 01:39:33,680
We need the capitalists back.

1253
01:39:33,745 --> 01:39:36,312
At this stage, we can't
eliminate them yet.

1254
01:39:37,473 --> 01:39:39,574
Production must be handled with care.

1255
01:39:39,574 --> 01:39:43,203
lf anything goes wrong,

1256
01:39:43,219 --> 01:39:46,125
it'll be worse than losing a battle.

1257
01:39:46,125 --> 01:39:48,047
We must know our limits.

1258
01:39:48,063 --> 01:39:50,952
We must learn from scratch.

1259
01:39:50,970 --> 01:39:53,809
The gist of political consultation

1260
01:39:53,809 --> 01:39:56,697
involves capitalists and
democracy activists.

1261
01:39:56,697 --> 01:39:58,625
We invite them to help run the country,

1262
01:39:58,625 --> 01:40:00,536
not to eliminate them.

1263
01:40:00,544 --> 01:40:04,515
We must be very clear on
this: if we destroy them

1264
01:40:04,515 --> 01:40:08,266
and we can't run production on our own,

1265
01:40:08,266 --> 01:40:12,218
factories will close down and
worker will lose their jobs.

1266
01:40:12,218 --> 01:40:15,930
We'll be smashing our own rice bowls.

1267
01:40:15,930 --> 01:40:36,890
We barely got our hands on
them, don't smash them.

1268
01:40:36,890 --> 01:40:41,595
Comrades, we ask two things of you.

1269
01:40:41,595 --> 01:40:44,552
Keep your backs straight and
your voices up, understand?

1270
01:40:44,552 --> 01:40:46,554
Yes.

1271
01:41:36,494 --> 01:41:39,304
Chairman Mao.

1272
01:41:39,317 --> 01:41:42,115
General Fu, you flatter me.

1273
01:41:42,264 --> 01:41:47,823
l promised to hold your
horsewhip if l lose.

1274
01:41:47,975 --> 01:41:49,497
Today, l'll hold the door for you.

1275
01:41:49,753 --> 01:41:55,571
You did not lose. The loser is in Nanjing.

1276
01:41:55,571 --> 01:41:59,393
Don't hold the door for me.

1277
01:41:59,402 --> 01:42:12,940
Help me open the door for a new China.

1278
01:42:12,940 --> 01:42:14,862
Salute.

1279
01:42:21,417 --> 01:42:22,588
Sir.

1280
01:42:22,598 --> 01:42:26,307
l'm with the 28th Army.

1281
01:42:29,127 --> 01:42:32,084
l'm here with the Tashan troops

1282
01:42:32,084 --> 01:42:34,006
to join the dress parade.

1283
01:42:36,981 --> 01:42:38,812
On behalf of

1284
01:42:40,754 --> 01:42:49,289
soldiers of the Red Army, dead or alive,

1285
01:42:49,289 --> 01:42:54,101
l salute you, Chairman Mao.

1286
01:43:05,784 --> 01:43:11,438
Forward...

1287
01:43:13,321 --> 01:43:18,190
Forward...

1288
01:43:19,043 --> 01:43:23,036
Forward...

1289
01:43:27,694 --> 01:43:37,422
Long live Chairman Mao.

1290
01:43:37,429 --> 01:43:41,145
Are these the 100,000 used guns

1291
01:43:41,145 --> 01:43:44,102
you mentioned in Chongqing
three years ago?

1292
01:43:44,102 --> 01:43:47,993
The CPC has come a long way.

1293
01:43:48,845 --> 01:43:52,838
Long live Chairman Mao.

1294
01:43:52,849 --> 01:43:57,559
Long live Commander Zhu.

1295
01:44:02,402 --> 01:44:06,259
Long live Chairman Mao.

1296
01:44:07,145 --> 01:44:11,832
Long live Commander Zhu.

1297
01:44:11,849 --> 01:44:15,717
Long live Chairman Mao.

1298
01:45:24,990 --> 01:45:29,637
Since they're crossing the
Yangtze River anyway,

1299
01:45:29,637 --> 01:45:31,557
what the hell is the point of negotiation?

1300
01:45:31,557 --> 01:45:34,543
To surrender before the fight begins?
l'm a soldier, l won't do it.

1301
01:45:34,543 --> 01:45:38,422
The CPC knew you're
different from Chiang.

1302
01:45:38,422 --> 01:45:41,178
Mao knows you enjoy being in the army.

1303
01:45:41,230 --> 01:45:45,127
He personally told me you might
continue to command the troops

1304
01:45:45,181 --> 01:45:47,069
up to as many as 400,000.

1305
01:45:47,082 --> 01:45:53,745
Nonsense. l'm already the
Minister of National Defense.

1306
01:45:53,745 --> 01:45:55,733
Zongren, we don't get along with Chiang.

1307
01:45:55,733 --> 01:45:58,395
That's our internal business.

1308
01:45:58,412 --> 01:46:01,436
lt's not up to the Communists
to jack us around.

1309
01:46:01,436 --> 01:46:06,275
What's the use of saying that now?

1310
01:46:06,327 --> 01:46:08,870
What are you suggesting then?

1311
01:46:10,019 --> 01:46:11,828
Let's wait for word from Xikou.

1312
01:46:59,052 --> 01:47:00,917
300,000 courageous PLA

1313
01:47:00,924 --> 01:47:04,745
crossed the Yangtze River on the 21st.

1314
01:47:04,497 --> 01:47:07,352
The campaign started at
midnight on the 20th.

1315
01:47:09,508 --> 01:47:15,345
Didn't even hold the
defense line for one day.

1316
01:47:15,345 --> 01:47:17,290
He Yingqin is retreating.

1317
01:47:17,304 --> 01:47:19,192
They say to Guangzhou.

1318
01:47:20,078 --> 01:47:21,181
Shall we go with them?

1319
01:47:21,192 --> 01:47:25,801
l have to look after the
interests of the United States.

1320
01:47:25,801 --> 01:47:27,723
l should stay here in Nanjing.

1321
01:47:30,582 --> 01:47:33,608
l heard the Soviet embassy

1322
01:47:33,625 --> 01:47:58,569
had relocated to Guangzhou
with the Government.

1323
01:47:58,569 --> 01:48:01,311
Morning, Madam. Morning

1324
01:48:01,325 --> 01:48:04,368
The sound of gunfire went on
all night. lt finally stopped.

1325
01:48:04,368 --> 01:48:08,020
Madam, you didn't sleep well.

1326
01:48:08,026 --> 01:48:09,948
l'll go for a walk.

1327
01:50:20,732 --> 01:50:25,408
Have you decided to leave?

1328
01:50:26,311 --> 01:50:27,369
Really?

1329
01:50:38,811 --> 01:50:40,733
Hello, Chairman Mao.

1330
01:50:40,741 --> 01:50:41,787
Hello, Chairman Mao.

1331
01:50:44,620 --> 01:50:46,429
Hello. Jishen.

1332
01:50:47,500 --> 01:50:51,311
Mr. Zhou. This way, please.

1333
01:50:52,233 --> 01:50:55,066
Chairman, Zhang Lan is here.

1334
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:02,898
Mr. Mao, you flatter me.

1335
01:51:02,910 --> 01:51:05,686
Not at all.

1336
01:51:06,664 --> 01:51:08,594
Master Zhang, how are you? Mr. Zhou.

1337
01:51:08,594 --> 01:51:09,640
Welcome, please come this way.

1338
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:10,641
Hello, Master Zhang.

1339
01:51:28,718 --> 01:51:32,529
Calling the CPPCC to establish
a new people's Government,

1340
01:51:32,529 --> 01:51:36,437
l recommend you both
for Vice Presidents.

1341
01:51:36,437 --> 01:51:40,294
l'd like to hear your opinion.

1342
01:51:40,306 --> 01:51:45,039
l'll go along with your arrangement.

1343
01:51:45,039 --> 01:51:46,085
You have something to say?

1344
01:51:51,847 --> 01:51:55,556
ls this your idea?

1345
01:51:56,685 --> 01:51:59,427
The Central Committee's idea.

1346
01:52:04,318 --> 01:52:19,603
l killed members of your party.

1347
01:52:19,603 --> 01:52:21,514
That was then, this is now.

1348
01:52:22,512 --> 01:52:24,468
All roads lead to Rome.

1349
01:52:24,481 --> 01:52:29,236
We can't change history.

1350
01:52:29,368 --> 01:52:32,166
Nobody's perfect.

1351
01:52:33,026 --> 01:52:35,954
A personal matter, no matter how
important, is a minor issue.

1352
01:52:35,954 --> 01:52:40,898
A state matter, no matter how trivial,
is a major issue, For the new state,

1353
01:52:40,898 --> 01:52:45,507
be our Vice President on behalf
of the Revolutionary Committee.

1354
01:52:45,507 --> 01:52:48,419
This is a state matter.

1355
01:52:48,435 --> 01:52:51,450
Forget the past.

1356
01:52:51,460 --> 01:52:55,175
The CPC is willing to work
with you to lead this country.

1357
01:52:55,175 --> 01:52:58,123
Let's help each other, as
we're in the same boat now.

1358
01:52:58,123 --> 01:53:00,910
Together, we'll make history.

1359
01:53:04,776 --> 01:53:07,756
As you wish.

1360
01:53:07,772 --> 01:53:12,448
l'll do my best for China.

1361
01:53:24,046 --> 01:53:26,926
We strongly urge our comrades in China

1362
01:53:26,926 --> 01:53:30,786
to set up their own government soon.

1363
01:53:30,786 --> 01:53:33,704
The USSR will, at the
earliest time possible,

1364
01:53:33,704 --> 01:53:42,355
set up diplomatic relations
with the new regime.

1365
01:53:42,355 --> 01:53:44,266
That's wonderful.

1366
01:53:46,973 --> 01:53:52,743
The frantic bombing of Shanghai
by the KMT is causing chaos.

1367
01:53:52,743 --> 01:53:56,593
l'm worried about Madam Sun's safety.

1368
01:53:56,593 --> 01:54:00,453
She's our most faithful friend
when we were in dire straits.

1369
01:54:00,453 --> 01:54:03,257
The new CPPCC is about to commence.

1370
01:54:03,257 --> 01:54:07,260
lt won't be complete without her.

1371
01:54:07,260 --> 01:54:09,125
Men like us

1372
01:54:09,132 --> 01:54:11,054
won't know how to talk to her.

1373
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:15,815
Send a female comrade
to escort her here.

1374
01:54:15,815 --> 01:54:19,780
Enlai, we'll burden
Yingchao with the task.

1375
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:22,499
Good idea.

1376
01:54:22,507 --> 01:54:26,386
Madam Zhou to escort Madam Sun.

1377
01:54:26,386 --> 01:54:30,288
l'll tell her right away.

1378
01:54:36,044 --> 01:54:38,012
To form a coalition
government without you

1379
01:54:38,012 --> 01:54:39,875
is something the Party
will never agree to.

1380
01:54:39,875 --> 01:54:44,608
Neither would the rest of the country.

1381
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:46,656
l'm only the vanguard.

1382
01:54:46,673 --> 01:54:49,543
lf l failed to convince
you, Enlai would be next

1383
01:54:49,543 --> 01:54:54,209
and then Chairman Mao himself.

1384
01:54:54,209 --> 01:54:57,235
lf we all failed to convince you,

1385
01:54:57,243 --> 01:54:59,922
we'd put this on the
agenda of the CPPCC,

1386
01:54:59,922 --> 01:55:05,817
vote on it and send a delegation.

1387
01:55:05,817 --> 01:55:07,626
You Communists

1388
01:55:07,641 --> 01:55:10,637
won't stop until you get what you want.

1389
01:55:10,637 --> 01:55:14,439
What do you think of this house?

1390
01:55:14,439 --> 01:55:18,270
Not bad, spacious and bright.

1391
01:55:18,270 --> 01:55:22,149
Mayor Chen Yi said he'd giving it to you

1392
01:55:22,149 --> 01:55:24,904
as a permanent site for the youth center

1393
01:55:24,904 --> 01:55:26,007
of your China Welfare Fund.

1394
01:55:26,018 --> 01:55:27,938
The children can play in here every day.

1395
01:55:27,938 --> 01:55:29,769
That's wonderful.

1396
01:56:04,345 --> 01:56:05,346
Madam Sun.

1397
01:56:05,363 --> 01:56:09,232
Times have changed, Zedong.
You mustn't do that.

1398
01:56:09,232 --> 01:56:12,076
Only for Madam Sun.

1399
01:56:13,710 --> 01:56:16,622
Thanks for the invitation
and Yingchao's company.

1400
01:56:17,739 --> 01:56:19,794
Now the Party can work
with all delegates

1401
01:56:19,794 --> 01:56:22,479
to build a new state,

1402
01:56:22,491 --> 01:56:25,353
l must thank your help and support.

1403
01:56:25,353 --> 01:56:27,388
You have been a great help to
the country and its people

1404
01:56:27,388 --> 01:56:29,344
and a benefactor of our Party.

1405
01:56:33,235 --> 01:56:34,953
Fellow delegates,

1406
01:56:35,155 --> 01:56:38,928
the yellow flag pole in the center of
figure No. 1 represents the Yellow River.

1407
01:56:39,680 --> 01:56:43,468
lt stands out. Those in favor,
please raise your hands.

1408
01:56:46,513 --> 01:56:49,539
Good. lt's unilateral.

1409
01:56:49,547 --> 01:56:50,525
l object.

1410
01:56:51,458 --> 01:56:52,390
From an artistic perspective,

1411
01:56:52,408 --> 01:56:55,263
No. 32 is much better.

1412
01:56:55,279 --> 01:56:57,190
Mr. Tian is an artist

1413
01:56:57,199 --> 01:56:59,906
who's partial to the 5 stars.

1414
01:57:01,981 --> 01:57:03,843
The person who submitted this design

1415
01:57:03,843 --> 01:57:05,840
is an ordinary clerk from Shanghai.

1416
01:57:05,840 --> 01:57:10,650
lt was disqualified in the first round,
but l want to bring it up again.

1417
01:57:10,650 --> 01:57:12,515
Because this design

1418
01:57:13,464 --> 01:57:14,522
is full of emotions.

1419
01:57:17,227 --> 01:57:20,232
l object to the version of the 4
stars representing the 4 classes.

1420
01:57:20,284 --> 01:57:24,871
l prefer the Yellow River pattern.

1421
01:57:24,927 --> 01:57:26,838
Simple and sharp.

1422
01:57:26,847 --> 01:57:36,535
How many in favor of the 5-star flag?

1423
01:57:36,535 --> 01:57:39,483
Delegate Xu Beihong suggests

1424
01:57:39,483 --> 01:57:42,353
we use "March of the Volunteers''
as the national anthem.

1425
01:57:42,353 --> 01:57:44,218
Let's hear your comments.

1426
01:57:46,126 --> 01:57:50,850
The melody is good, but we
need to change the lyrics.

1427
01:57:50,850 --> 01:57:53,762
This is a new China.

1428
01:57:53,779 --> 01:57:57,619
The original lyrics are outdated.

1429
01:57:57,619 --> 01:58:00,499
Mr. Tian Han, you're the lyricist.

1430
01:58:00,499 --> 01:58:02,455
What's your opinion?

1431
01:58:02,468 --> 01:58:05,233
l should refrain from commenting.
l'll listen to the others.

1432
01:58:05,233 --> 01:58:09,063
l agree we should change the lyrics.

1433
01:58:09,063 --> 01:58:10,189
We can't sing it every day,

1434
01:58:10,206 --> 01:58:12,003
especially this line:

1435
01:58:12,011 --> 01:58:14,056
"As the Chinese nation faces
its greatest peril.''

1436
01:58:14,056 --> 01:58:15,796
lt won't work.

1437
01:58:15,803 --> 01:58:18,655
l disagree, "La Marseillaise'' of France

1438
01:58:18,655 --> 01:58:22,611
is tragic but has been
handed down till now.

1439
01:58:22,611 --> 01:58:24,522
That's France, not China.

1440
01:58:24,531 --> 01:58:29,312
The lyrics of the song remind us

1441
01:58:29,312 --> 01:58:33,203
not to forget the past. l agree.

1442
01:58:33,210 --> 01:58:37,003
New China needs a new
song for its new outlook.

1443
01:58:37,003 --> 01:58:41,784
Why use a song from an old movie?

1444
01:58:41,784 --> 01:58:42,830
What about you, Mr. Li?

1445
01:58:49,465 --> 01:58:53,430
"March of the Volunteers''
was written for the war.

1446
01:58:53,430 --> 01:58:59,095
l sang it before. lt's inspirational
and gets my blood boiling.

1447
01:58:59,095 --> 01:59:03,012
''Let our flesh and blood
become our new Great Wall''.

1448
01:59:03,012 --> 01:59:05,788
We must remember history.

1449
01:59:05,796 --> 01:59:08,572
No need to change the lyrics.

1450
01:59:08,590 --> 01:59:09,682
Well said.

1451
01:59:10,664 --> 01:59:15,445
Agree. l have a good
sense for danger too.

1452
01:59:15,445 --> 01:59:21,273
The Chairman wishes to
keep the original lyrics.

1453
01:59:21,273 --> 01:59:25,891
What about you? You
kept raising your hand.

1454
01:59:25,891 --> 01:59:30,807
They took the words out of
my mouth. l have no comment.

1455
01:59:30,807 --> 01:59:32,627
Let me say just one thing.

1456
01:59:35,254 --> 01:59:41,090
To be vigilant in peace time is
what a mature nation should do.

1457
01:59:41,349 --> 01:59:45,115
We'll let Mr. Tian Han decide.

1458
01:59:47,090 --> 01:59:49,024
Then let's keep the lyrics.

1459
02:00:14,710 --> 02:00:16,661
Chairman Mao, fellow delegates.

1460
02:00:16,661 --> 02:00:18,424
Are you ready?

1461
02:00:21,331 --> 02:00:23,276
Look over here, ready.

1462
02:00:27,250 --> 02:00:30,048
This is a women's delegation.

1463
02:00:32,055 --> 02:00:36,706
Chairman, everyone is talking about
the pattern on the national flag.

1464
02:00:36,706 --> 02:00:38,685
What do you think?

1465
02:00:38,695 --> 02:00:41,562
l like the Yellow River.

1466
02:00:41,568 --> 02:00:42,569
l disagree.

1467
02:00:47,430 --> 02:00:50,274
Can you fix the negative? Yes.

1468
02:00:50,284 --> 02:00:51,285
Take out the person next to me.

1469
02:00:52,225 --> 02:00:54,041
There are over 10 people next to you.

1470
02:00:54,041 --> 02:00:57,933
l mean the man who jammed in.

1471
02:00:57,933 --> 02:01:00,754
Alright. Thank you.

1472
02:01:00,767 --> 02:01:03,782
What's your reason?

1473
02:01:03,794 --> 02:01:08,378
Chairman, adding a pole to the middle

1474
02:01:08,378 --> 02:01:10,338
gives the impression of
splitting up the country.

1475
02:01:10,338 --> 02:01:12,337
ls that the right interpretation?

1476
02:01:12,337 --> 02:01:17,026
Can't be that serious. Most
people prefer this one.

1477
02:01:17,078 --> 02:01:21,781
Gong Peng, what do you think?

1478
02:01:21,850 --> 02:01:24,728
We like No. 32.

1479
02:01:24,742 --> 02:01:26,827
Placing five stars in the left corner

1480
02:01:26,827 --> 02:01:28,595
with four small stars surrounding

1481
02:01:28,595 --> 02:01:32,554
and their tips pointing at the
big star. lt looks pretty.

1482
02:01:32,554 --> 02:01:36,417
Chairman, the big star in the
middle represents the Party

1483
02:01:36,417 --> 02:01:39,156
while the small ones
represent the 4 classes.

1484
02:01:39,156 --> 02:01:40,134
The symbolism is correct.

1485
02:01:40,146 --> 02:01:44,969
Looking at this flag makes
one feel enthusiastic.

1486
02:01:44,969 --> 02:01:46,004
Enthusiastic?

1487
02:01:46,017 --> 02:01:49,784
l feel excited when l look at the flag.

1488
02:01:49,784 --> 02:01:52,724
Madam Sun likes this design too.

1489
02:01:52,724 --> 02:01:55,626
You have been abroad, your
opinion should count.

1490
02:01:55,626 --> 02:01:57,412
Please tell us what you think.

1491
02:01:58,509 --> 02:02:02,256
The five stars design is a good
representation of China's situation.

1492
02:02:02,256 --> 02:02:04,255
Under the leadership of the CPC,

1493
02:02:04,255 --> 02:02:07,974
all the classes are united
to build a new China.

1494
02:02:07,974 --> 02:02:11,058
The color is sharp, solemn and grand.

1495
02:02:11,510 --> 02:02:16,220
The truth is, China is united. Well said.

1496
02:02:17,132 --> 02:02:21,956
We're united now and we'll
always be in the future.

1497
02:02:22,407 --> 02:02:25,357
ls the air raid on Beiping feasible?

1498
02:02:25,357 --> 02:02:34,927
The Chairman wants feedback
from the Air Force.

1499
02:02:34,927 --> 02:02:36,781
The flying radius is too big.

1500
02:02:38,867 --> 02:02:43,653
The planes must re-tank somewhere

1501
02:02:43,653 --> 02:02:46,406
or they won't make it back.

1502
02:02:46,420 --> 02:02:48,419
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has
liaised with the Americans in Korea.

1503
02:02:48,419 --> 02:02:50,284
You can rest assured.

1504
02:02:56,096 --> 02:02:59,018
But the CPC has its air force now.

1505
02:02:59,018 --> 02:03:01,785
The Chairman only wants to know

1506
02:03:01,785 --> 02:03:12,547
if the air raid is feasible. That's all.

1507
02:03:12,547 --> 02:03:19,091
Despite the difficulties, as
long as he issues the order,

1508
02:03:19,091 --> 02:03:21,025
we'll get it done.

1509
02:03:34,610 --> 02:03:37,420
Fellow delegates,

1510
02:03:37,435 --> 02:03:41,375
the CPPCC that the whole
country is looking forward to

1511
02:03:41,375 --> 02:03:43,149
will now commence.

1512
02:03:47,899 --> 02:03:50,879
The new CPPCC

1513
02:03:50,898 --> 02:03:53,867
will commence on a
brand new foundation.

1514
02:03:53,867 --> 02:03:57,682
lt represents the Chinese people

1515
02:03:57,682 --> 02:04:03,303
and has the people's faith and support.

1516
02:04:02,755 --> 02:04:07,680
Therefore, the CPPCC
hereby announces

1517
02:04:07,243 --> 02:04:11,111
its right to call this meeting.

1518
02:04:16,756 --> 02:04:19,589
Fellow delegates,

1519
02:04:19,600 --> 02:04:23,491
we have a consensus

1520
02:04:23,501 --> 02:04:25,412
that our work here

1521
02:04:25,423 --> 02:04:28,358
will go down in history.

1522
02:04:28,373 --> 02:04:32,198
lt proves that China, which accounts
for 1/4 of the world's population,

1523
02:04:32,198 --> 02:04:35,076
is finally on her feet.

1524
02:04:44,719 --> 02:04:50,417
The destiny of China is in
the hands of her people.

1525
02:04:50,417 --> 02:04:54,203
China will rise like the sun in the east.

1526
02:04:54,203 --> 02:04:58,191
lts radiance will illuminate the land

1527
02:04:58,191 --> 02:05:03,005
and cleanse the filth and mire left
behind by the reactionary government.

1528
02:05:03,005 --> 02:05:07,771
Heal the wounds of war
and build a brand new

1529
02:05:07,771 --> 02:05:13,411
and powerful People's Republic of China.

1530
02:05:13,411 --> 02:05:15,429
Long live the People's Republic of China.

1531
02:05:15,429 --> 02:05:17,342
Long live the Coalition Government.

1532
02:05:17,342 --> 02:07:11,710
Long live the unity of the people.

1533
02:07:11,702 --> 02:07:13,705
According to Commander Zhou,

1534
02:07:13,737 --> 02:07:15,582
the planes are in Class A status.

1535
02:07:15,582 --> 02:07:20,339
They're ready to bombard
Beiping any time.

1536
02:07:20,339 --> 02:07:29,054
But the US has turned down our
request to refuel in Pusan.

1537
02:07:29,054 --> 02:07:30,874
What does that mean?

1538
02:07:30,890 --> 02:07:46,399
They can't come back after takeoff.

1539
02:07:46,399 --> 02:07:52,020
What time is Mao's founding ceremony?

1540
02:07:52,020 --> 02:07:54,830
3pm at Tiananmen Square.

1541
02:08:20,002 --> 02:08:38,260
lt's fate. The KMT is
ruined with our own hands.

1542
02:08:38,260 --> 02:08:40,182
Cancel the mission.

1543
02:08:42,901 --> 02:08:44,004
Yes, sir.

1544
02:09:32,994 --> 02:09:39,710
The People's Republic of China and

1545
02:09:39,710 --> 02:09:43,640
the Central People's Government

1546
02:09:43,640 --> 02:09:47,451
have been established today.
