00:10:59,508 --> 00:11:01,175
to serve as peacekeepers.

166
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:04,092
And we are proud to accept.

167
00:11:06,925 --> 00:11:08,300
We are a country

168
00:11:08,383 --> 00:11:11,550
that has never owned or tried to conquer

169
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:12,967
another sovereign nation.

170
00:11:14,550 --> 00:11:15,675
As a neutral country,

171
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:18,258
Ireland has chosen
to never be the aggressor.

172
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:20,425
That's why they have asked for us.

173
00:11:22,592 --> 00:11:24,925
And if anybody thinks
we're to be taken lightly...

174
00:11:26,175 --> 00:11:27,508
we'll show them

175
00:11:27,592 --> 00:11:30,050
that they are very sadly mistaken.

176
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:33,508
Am I right, soldiers?

177
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,133
[all] Yes, sir!

178
00:11:47,258 --> 00:11:48,717
Carry on, Company Sergeant.

179
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,842
Yes, sir.

180
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:52,800

[reporters clamoring]

186
00:12:16,425 --> 00:12:20,758
We welcome the forces
of the United Nations here with open arms

187
00:12:20,842 --> 00:12:22,592
but with some confusion.

188
00:12:23,883 --> 00:12:26,383
We don't know why you are here
in Africa...

189
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:30,050
as we are quite capable
of looking after ourselves.

190
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:33,883
However, we will be thoughtful hosts.

191
00:12:34,758 --> 00:12:36,633
Unless you come here to start trouble,

192
00:12:36,717 --> 00:12:37,758
in which case

193
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,717
you will force us to tutor you

194
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,467
on how things are done here in the Congo.

195
00:12:44,008 --> 00:12:46,883
- [reporter] General Tshombe!
- Gentlemen, that's it. We're done.

196
00:12:47,883 --> 00:12:50,508
[Hammarskjöld]
<i>I had a call from Khrushchev earlier.</i>

197
00:12:50,592 --> 00:12:53,800
He reminded me
of the UN's refusal to send in troops

198
00:12:53,883 --> 00:12:55,342
when Lumumba asked me to.

199
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,842
It's amazing how good an atheist is
in inflicting guilt.

200
00:13:00,925 --> 00:13:02,050
[chuckles]

201
00:13:03,092 --> 00:13:05,758
Meanwhile,
they're building a wall in Berlin.

202
00:13:07,217 --> 00:13:08,300
I know.

203
00:13:08,383 --> 00:13:09,717
Kennedy called.

204
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:13,508
[O'Brien] What did the Sun King of Camelot
have to say?

205
00:13:13,592 --> 00:13:17,217
[Hammarskjöld] We can't do anything
in Berlin, Vietnam or Cuba,

206
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,133
but we can defuse the Congo.

207
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:22,008
And I want you to go.

208
00:13:22,842 --> 00:13:24,967
Put an end to General Tshombe's antics.

209
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:27,133
- Send him a message.
- Excuse me?

210
00:13:27,217 --> 00:13:29,592
I want you to be our man on the ground.

211
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:31,300
But this thing, this...

212
00:13:32,717 --> 00:13:34,467
could lead to another world war.

213
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:36,550
Yes, and everybody sees that.

214
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:39,217
So the man who stops it

215
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,967
will get a lot of credit.

216
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:43,300
We'll make up a plan.

217
00:13:44,175 --> 00:13:45,217
What kind of plan?

218
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:47,842
One with a lot of moving parts

219
00:13:47,925 --> 00:13:51,175
that requires a man astute
and hard-headed enough to pull it off.

220
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:54,550
We each have our part to play in history.

221
00:13:55,842 --> 00:13:58,092
Yours is happening right now, Conor.

222
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,008
I believe I can...

223
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:06,175
accomplish the mission, sir.

224
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:07,300
Good, Conor.

225
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:10,133
Good.

We've got exposure on three approaches.
Overlooked from the south.

251

And there's a road splitting it in two.

Okay.

Have the men up for drill at 0600.

Very pleasant, thank you, General.

with any real military experience.

CQMS says we have food provisions,
enough for two days.

301

The men have their own rations, but mostly
biscuits you wouldn't feed to your dog.

302
00:20:10,883 --> 00:20:12,133
Time to hunt and gather.

as that truck outside can carry.

Where's the best bar in town?

309
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:44,508
At the end of the street.

310
00:20:46,508 --> 00:20:49,258
I don't think you will find
any of the bars here to your liking.

311
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,383
Why is that?

I don't mean to be rude,

313
00:20:54,842 --> 00:20:57,425
but you do know
that you're not welcome here, don't you?

314

I'll take one of these.

The people around here
are not particularly happy

317
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:09,508
They didn't like Lumumba taking over.

318
00:21:10,592 --> 00:21:12,383
But he was elected by the people.

319
00:21:12,467 --> 00:21:15,467
Who didn't put a lot of thought
into what would happen to the mines

320
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,883
when he took over.

321
00:21:16,967 --> 00:21:18,925
Nationalizing the minerals,

322
00:21:19,008 --> 00:21:20,758
throwing out the mining companies.

323
00:21:21,258 --> 00:21:22,758
What did he expect to happen?

324
00:21:24,467 --> 00:21:26,550
I don't suppose
he expected to be assassinated.

325
00:21:27,258 --> 00:21:28,675
I love this country,

All right? So let's go!

657
00:46:35,342 --> 00:46:36,717
Let's go!

658
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:39,717
The real problem's the ammo.
We've only 13,000 rounds.

659
00:46:41,050 --> 00:46:42,258
It's not gonna last long.

660
00:46:43,508 --> 00:46:45,383
Sir, I've got General McEntee.

661
00:46:52,133 --> 00:46:54,217
General, request an immediate update.

662
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,967
Report your situation, Commandant.

663
00:46:56,550 --> 00:46:57,675
Company A, Jadotville

664
00:46:57,758 --> 00:46:59,758
has been under mortar
and machine-gun fire.

665
00:46:59,842 --> 00:47:01,592
Expect a heavy attack any moment.

666
00:47:01,675 --> 00:47:03,633
I sent a man. I told you this was coming.

667
00:47:03,717 --> 00:47:05,467
Watch yourself, Commandant.

668
00:47:06,258 --> 00:47:07,592
<i>General...</i>

669
00:47:07,675 --> 00:47:09,050
I'm in a bad situation here

670
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:10,175
and I need your help.

671
00:47:10,925 --> 00:47:12,217
From the dead they left,

672
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,633
I'd say
we're looking at a force of about 1,500.

673
00:47:15,717 --> 00:47:18,008
<i>I need you to send reinforcements
right now.</i>

674
00:47:18,550 --> 00:47:19,800
Send as many as you can.

675
00:47:19,883 --> 00:47:22,758
There's a negative exercise outcome
if we don't get them.

676
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,467
Is that him?

677
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:27,592
[McEntee] Mm.

678
00:47:31,008 --> 00:47:33,508
Commandant,
this is Dr Conor Cruise O'Brien.

679
00:47:33,592 --> 00:47:35,425
I urge you to stop panicking.

680
00:47:35,508 --> 00:47:36,550
<i>Panicking?</i>

681
00:47:36,633 --> 00:47:39,800
<i>With respect, sir, are you aware
of the realities on the ground?</i>

682
00:47:39,883 --> 00:47:41,967
I assure you I'm very well aware of them.

683
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:44,550
These are the final death gasps
of Tshombe's government.

684
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:46,342
I'm not sure he knows that.

685
00:47:46,842 --> 00:47:49,300
Hold your position.
Allow our plan to play out.

686
00:47:49,383 --> 00:47:50,967
<i>The plan is two days old</i>

687
00:47:51,050 --> 00:47:53,300
and didn't include Tshombe's mercs.

688
00:47:53,383 --> 00:47:55,300
What went wrong with your plan, sir?

689
00:47:55,383 --> 00:47:57,842
Sounds like you're looking for an excuse,
Commandant.

690
00:47:58,758 --> 00:48:00,842
We each have our part to play in history.

691
00:48:00,925 --> 00:48:02,592
Yours is happening right now.

692
00:48:02,675 --> 00:48:04,550
Rely on us to make sure it all works out.

693
00:48:05,133 --> 00:48:07,633
Sir, I don't understand
what you just said to me,

694
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:10,967
and in tactical terms
I don't understand what you're doing.

695
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:14,008
I have 150 boys here
and we need reinforcements.

696
00:48:14,092 --> 00:48:15,592
No, you listen to me, Quinlan.

697
00:48:15,675 --> 00:48:18,383
There are larger things at play
than you can possibly imagine.

698
00:48:18,467 --> 00:48:20,633
I don't give a damn
about the larger things!

699
00:48:20,717 --> 00:48:22,300
We're a company under siege

700
00:48:22,383 --> 00:48:24,217
and we require your assistance!

701
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:26,592
Discuss the details with General McEntee.

<i>General,
does he have a clue what he's doing?</i>

704
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:34,758
All our troops in the field
are on Operation Morthor, Commandant.

705
00:48:35,383 --> 00:48:37,092
We don't have any reinforcements.

706
00:48:37,175 --> 00:48:38,217
Exactly.

707
00:48:38,592 --> 00:48:40,758
<i>Nobody thought this was a possibility,
did they?</i>

708
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,217
When do our men come back in?

709
00:48:44,300 --> 00:48:47,175
<i>A heavy-weapons battalion's
expected here within 12 hours.</i>

710
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,467
They'll be sent out to you immediately.

711
00:48:50,342 --> 00:48:51,383
Thank you, sir.

712
00:48:52,383 --> 00:48:53,425
One more thing.

713
00:48:54,258 --> 00:48:55,842
We could do with some whiskey.

I'll see what I can do.

[Quinlan] Follow me.

717
00:49:11,175 --> 00:49:14,050
What exactly did he mean
by "negative exercise outcome"?

718
00:49:14,133 --> 00:49:17,883
It means that without reinforcements...
we're fucked.

00:59:14,383 --> 00:59:15,592
Cover fire!

821
00:59:17,050 --> 00:59:19,175
Hegarty, get in the trench!

822
00:59:28,508 --> 00:59:29,592
Come here! Come here!

823
00:59:35,508 --> 00:59:36,925
Come on.

824
00:59:37,008 --> 00:59:38,842
Grab hold of my belt and don't let go.

825
00:59:38,925 --> 00:59:41,175
[Hegarty] I can't see! I can't see!

826
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:44,383
[yells in French]

827
00:59:49,925 --> 00:59:51,467
I'm blind! They hit my head!

828
00:59:51,550 --> 00:59:53,133
You're fine. You're fine.

829
00:59:53,217 --> 00:59:55,300
We're going for the trench, all right?

830
00:59:56,467 --> 00:59:57,675
Don't drop me.

831
00:59:57,758 --> 00:59:59,842
Yeah, boy. Fuck, okay, come on.

832
01:00:15,717 --> 01:00:17,592
- [shouts in French]
- [whistle blows]

833
01:00:17,675 --> 01:00:19,217
[mercenaries yelling]

834
01:00:24,092 --> 01:00:25,342
[Joyce] We have to move.

835
01:00:26,467 --> 01:00:27,300
Go!

836
01:00:28,717 --> 01:00:29,592
Go! Go! Go!

837
01:00:33,717 --> 01:00:35,508
Target: X-ray four.

838
01:00:35,592 --> 01:00:37,592
Two thousand two hundred yards.

839
01:00:41,050 --> 01:00:42,092
Fire one!

840
01:01:14,342 --> 01:01:16,550
Dud. Timer blew.

841
01:01:16,633 --> 01:01:17,842
Bag it.

842
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:22,217
[Donnelly] Fire two!

843
01:01:31,675 --> 01:01:33,800
[grunts] Right in the red ring!

844
01:01:33,883 --> 01:01:35,342
[sequential explosions]

845
01:01:36,342 --> 01:01:38,508
That's their mortars going off.

846
01:01:40,217 --> 01:01:41,383
[shouts in French]

847
01:01:43,008 --> 01:01:44,175
Pick your targets!

848
01:01:47,133 --> 01:01:49,675
- [whistle blowing]
- [mercenaries yelling]

849
01:01:50,800 --> 01:01:51,967
[mercenary cries out]

850
01:01:53,967 --> 01:01:55,008
Retreat!

851
01:02:01,967 --> 01:02:03,217
Cease fire!

852
01:02:03,842 --> 01:02:05,300
[distant soldier] Cease fire!

853
01:02:08,342 --> 01:02:09,383
[gunfire ceases]

854
01:02:32,675 --> 01:02:34,550
You acquitted yourself well out there.

855
01:02:41,508 --> 01:02:42,592
What?

856
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:43,508
Nothing.

857
01:02:44,925 --> 01:02:45,967
It was something.

858
01:02:50,633 --> 01:02:51,925
I felt scared.

859
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:54,550
- It's only natural.
- No, that's not it.

860
01:02:56,467 --> 01:02:57,633
I was scared.

861
01:03:00,008 --> 01:03:01,758
But then... I liked it.

862
01:03:03,092 --> 01:03:04,133
The killing.

863
01:03:05,467 --> 01:03:06,925
It's what you're trained to do.

864
01:03:07,675 --> 01:03:08,717
You didn't like it.

865
01:03:12,925 --> 01:03:15,883
Each man reacts differently
to killing another man.

866
01:03:19,508 --> 01:03:21,092
None of us have done this before.

867
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:25,258
Talk to me in a few days.

868
01:03:27,842 --> 01:03:29,467
Oh, you think we'll last that long?

869
01:03:40,550 --> 01:03:42,467
How many dead at Radio Katanga?

870
01:03:42,550 --> 01:03:43,592
Thirty, sir.

871
01:03:44,175 --> 01:03:48,633
This will negate a vast reserve
of goodwill towards the organization

872
01:03:48,717 --> 01:03:52,092
and show that we cannot behave any better
than any single country.

873
01:03:52,175 --> 01:03:53,883
Sir, these things happen in war.

874
01:03:54,425 --> 01:03:55,550
Not in my war.

875
01:03:57,925 --> 01:04:00,008
What was O'Brien's role in all of this?

876
01:04:01,758 --> 01:04:02,925
He's a smart man, sir,

877
01:04:03,008 --> 01:04:06,050
but he's an academic
who thinks that everything stands still

878
01:04:06,133 --> 01:04:07,717
while he thinks about what to do.

879
01:04:12,092 --> 01:04:13,258
We are a new thing.

880
01:04:13,883 --> 01:04:16,133
Sometimes new things stumble.

881
01:04:16,217 --> 01:04:17,717
But we pick ourselves up...

882
01:04:18,967 --> 01:04:21,550
instead of pretending
that we didn't fall.

883
01:04:21,633 --> 01:04:24,675
So we're going to say that,
in our first military intervention,

884
01:04:24,758 --> 01:04:25,592
we got it all wrong?

885
01:04:26,925 --> 01:04:28,383
We acknowledge the action...

886
01:04:29,758 --> 01:04:31,300
but we distance ourselves.

887
01:04:31,967 --> 01:04:33,717
It's our plan, our forces.

888
01:04:34,300 --> 01:04:35,800
How do we distance ourselves?

889
01:04:36,383 --> 01:04:37,550
By applying blame.

890
01:05:00,258 --> 01:05:01,300
Dr O'Brien.

891
01:05:02,592 --> 01:05:03,633
General Tshombe.

892
01:05:06,467 --> 01:05:08,758
[Tshombe]
I would say, "Welcome to my country.

893
01:05:08,842 --> 01:05:10,175
Make yourself at home,"

894
01:05:10,258 --> 01:05:12,217
but it appears you already have.

895
01:05:13,717 --> 01:05:15,050
Well, there are those

896
01:05:15,133 --> 01:05:17,300
who might say you're a little premature

897
01:05:17,383 --> 01:05:19,425
in taking command of who you welcome.

898
01:05:20,133 --> 01:05:22,800
Would you rather my predecessor
was still in charge?

899
01:05:22,883 --> 01:05:25,383
The only people he welcomed
were the communists.

900
01:05:25,467 --> 01:05:28,425
Or perhaps
you would rather we send all our cobalt,

901
01:05:28,508 --> 01:05:31,175
copper and uranium to the USSR?

902
01:05:31,258 --> 01:05:32,342
[O'Brien chuckles]

903
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:34,300
Of course not, General.

904
01:05:35,217 --> 01:05:38,217
It's just you haven't been elected
to the office you claim to hold.

905
01:05:38,300 --> 01:05:41,217
I am merely saying that Katanga,

906
01:05:41,300 --> 01:05:42,342
my province,

907
01:05:42,425 --> 01:05:44,008
is no longer part of the Congo...

908
01:05:44,967 --> 01:05:46,342
and I am its president.

909
01:05:46,883 --> 01:05:49,300
Yes, well, that's a little like Texas

910
01:05:49,383 --> 01:05:52,008
saying it's no longer part of the USA,

911
01:05:52,092 --> 01:05:54,675
that its oil
gives it the power to do that.

912
01:05:54,758 --> 01:05:55,800
[Tshombe chuckles]

913
01:05:55,883 --> 01:05:57,675
Factually, that would be correct.

914
01:05:58,217 --> 01:05:59,508
They were part of Mexico.

915
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:02,300
America land-grabbed Texas.

916
01:06:02,383 --> 01:06:04,508
Sir, I would like to see
an end to the conflict

917
01:06:04,592 --> 01:06:07,508
between the United Nations
and those loyal to you in Katanga.

918
01:06:07,592 --> 01:06:11,883
Then recognize Katanga's
legitimate government and president

919
01:06:11,967 --> 01:06:14,342
in a United Nations resolution.

920
01:06:18,925 --> 01:06:21,717
That's... simply not being realistic.

921
01:06:30,967 --> 01:06:32,967
Do you think we did not hear the rumors

922
01:06:33,050 --> 01:06:35,342
about the Radio Katanga massacre?

923
01:06:37,717 --> 01:06:38,758
Rumors? Well...

924
01:06:40,842 --> 01:06:42,883
- They're inaccurate.
- I don't think so.

925
01:06:44,008 --> 01:06:46,592
I think the United Nations,

926
01:06:46,675 --> 01:06:50,508
this paragon of virtue and fairness...

927
01:06:51,717 --> 01:06:54,092
executed my loyalists.

928
01:06:55,383 --> 01:06:56,425
[Tshombe] Hm?

929
01:06:58,008 --> 01:07:00,508
Sir, I'm sure we can find a way

930
01:07:00,592 --> 01:07:02,633
to draw ourselves back from the brink.

931
01:07:02,717 --> 01:07:07,592
Then recognize Katanga's
legitimate government and president

932
01:07:07,675 --> 01:07:10,550
in a United Nations resolution.

933
01:07:12,133 --> 01:07:13,883
That's simply not going to happen.

934
01:07:13,967 --> 01:07:16,633
Then enough of this, Dr O'Brien.

935
01:07:18,633 --> 01:07:21,092
The United Nations went from peacekeeping

936
01:07:21,175 --> 01:07:22,467
to peace enforcement.

937
01:07:23,717 --> 01:07:25,133
And your mission has failed.

938
01:07:30,717 --> 01:07:33,175
Did you forget about your fellow Irishmen

939
01:07:33,258 --> 01:07:34,550
left out in the field?

940
01:07:35,842 --> 01:07:37,008
What do you mean?

941
01:07:37,092 --> 01:07:38,133
Because I didn't.

942
01:07:40,342 --> 01:07:42,008
I didn't forget about them at all.

943
01:07:55,467 --> 01:07:58,717
My boys are giving everything they've got,
but there's just not enough of us.

944
01:07:59,258 --> 01:08:02,550
I give you my word, you'll have
reinforcements with you tomorrow.

945
01:08:03,175 --> 01:08:05,425
We'll hold out
until our last bullet's spent.

946
01:08:05,967 --> 01:08:07,425
We could do with that whiskey.

947
01:08:14,383 --> 01:08:16,217
[Quinlan]
They're going after the ammo hut!

948
01:08:18,133 --> 01:08:19,175
[soldier] Go, move!

949
01:08:25,717 --> 01:08:27,175
[Quinlan] Get this out of here! Go!

950
01:08:31,592 --> 01:08:32,717
- [Quinlan] Go!
- Run!

951
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:33,967
Grab this one.

952
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:57,717
That will be blowing up all night.

953
01:09:01,300 --> 01:09:03,217
We'd better get our reinforcements
tomorrow.

954
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:04,467
We'd fucking better.

955
01:09:05,592 --> 01:09:07,258
[US Ambassador] <i>Mr Secretary General,</i>

956
01:09:07,342 --> 01:09:10,258
in view of your failure
to prevent civil war in the Congo,

957
01:09:10,342 --> 01:09:13,258
President Kennedy
has personally told me to insist

958
01:09:13,342 --> 01:09:15,592
that the United States play a larger part

959
01:09:15,675 --> 01:09:19,050
in your mishandled military adventure.

960
01:09:19,133 --> 01:09:20,758
Please tell President Kennedy

961
01:09:20,842 --> 01:09:22,300
that I appreciate the offer.

962
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:26,050
[USSR Ambassador] You are aware
that if you had responded sooner

963
01:09:26,133 --> 01:09:29,592
to Prime Minister Lumumba's
request for UN intervention,

964
01:09:29,675 --> 01:09:31,758
we would not be where we are today.

965
01:09:31,842 --> 01:09:34,383
We might well have arrived here
by other means.

966
01:09:34,467 --> 01:09:36,967
Has General Tshombe
even accepted a cease fire yet?

967
01:09:37,050 --> 01:09:39,425
He has not. That's my first priority.

968
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:40,633
Thank you, gentlemen.

969
01:09:42,425 --> 01:09:44,383
- [aide] Sir?
- Call Tshombe directly.

970
01:09:45,258 --> 01:09:48,133
Tell him that the Secretary General
of the United Nations

971
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:50,092
is flying to meet with him in the Congo.

972
01:09:51,550 --> 01:09:53,092
See if that gets his attention.

973
01:10:00,383 --> 01:10:01,425
[flies buzzing]

974
01:10:06,883 --> 01:10:08,467
Would you like to say a few words?

975
01:10:17,217 --> 01:10:18,467
They poisoned the water.

976
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:21,258
Take what you can from the barrels.
It's all we have. Do it now.

977
01:10:25,258 --> 01:10:27,008
- Cooley, get more buckets.
- Yes, sir.

978
01:10:28,883 --> 01:10:30,092
[distant heavy gunfire]

979
01:10:31,592 --> 01:10:34,508
Radio! That'll be our reinforcements.

980
01:10:36,258 --> 01:10:37,592
[distant gunfire continues]

981
01:10:38,800 --> 01:10:39,842
What are you hearing?

982
01:10:41,008 --> 01:10:43,008
Nothing of ours, if that's what you mean.

983
01:10:45,592 --> 01:10:46,633
