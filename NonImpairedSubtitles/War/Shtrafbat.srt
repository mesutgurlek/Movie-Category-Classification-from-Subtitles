1
00:02:49,422 --> 00:03:01,262
- Please, gentlemen POWs, have something to eat

2
00:03:01,418 --> 00:03:03,418
- Calm down, calm down

3
00:03:03,418 --> 00:03:06,418
There's enough for everyone, no need to push

4
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:07,377
Have your fill

5
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
Hogs

6
00:04:02,399 --> 00:04:07,399
Hogs.  Vasiliy Stepanych, check out these jerks stuffing themselves

7
00:04:07,398 --> 00:04:11,398
Why jerks?

8
00:04:11,396 --> 00:04:12,396
Hunger is a strong motivator

9
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:21,393
Enough, pigs!

10
00:04:21,393 --> 00:04:25,393
Enough, enough!

11
00:04:25,392 --> 00:04:26,552
There are still many more hungry.

12
00:04:37,388 --> 00:04:39,068
And you stay

13
00:04:56,382 --> 00:04:58,382
This cattle

14
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:01,382
Bydlo, they will be in camp podyhat

15
00:05:01,381 --> 00:05:04,381
You are true soldiers

16
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:11,380
and I offer you to fight alongside us.

17
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:14,378
No, not for Great Germany.

18
00:05:14,377 --> 00:05:15,377
To fight against the Bolsheviks

19
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:17,376
for Russia,

20
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:23,376
After Germany's victory, someone must run Russia?

21
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:25,374
So you will be the ones to run

22
00:05:25,373 --> 00:05:28,373
free Russia,

23
00:05:28,372 --> 00:05:34,372
So said your General Vlasov

24
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,130
You?

25
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:46,127
You?

26
00:05:50,365 --> 00:05:51,125
No

27
00:05:54,364 --> 00:05:55,124
You?

28
00:05:56,363 --> 00:06:02,363
Stick it where the sun don't shine

29
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:03,122
You?

30
00:06:05,361 --> 00:06:06,681
Screw you

31
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:12,719
You?

32
00:06:15,158 --> 00:06:17,158
I'm with the rest of us

33
00:06:20,356 --> 00:06:21,356
You?

34
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:22,596
I'll go

35
00:06:26,354 --> 00:06:30,354
If it's against the Bolsheviks, I'll go

36
00:06:30,353 --> 00:06:31,353
Name?

37
00:06:31,352 --> 00:06:33,152
Captain Sazonov

38
00:06:37,351 --> 00:06:38,351
I welcome,

39
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,350
your courageous decision.

40
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:43,349
You can go

41
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:44,349
that way

42
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:53,346
And I'll go,

43
00:06:53,346 --> 00:07:00,346
I hate those communists, Christ-killers

44
00:07:00,343 --> 00:07:02,343
Name?

45
00:07:02,343 --> 00:07:06,343
Nikolai Sergeevich Yevseyev

46
00:07:06,341 --> 00:07:07,781
You can go

47
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,340
That way

48
00:07:14,339 --> 00:07:16,339
Enough

49
00:07:16,338 --> 00:07:18,338
Liquidate these ones

50
00:07:18,338 --> 00:07:27,338
I've said before, your dumb experiments

51
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:29,335
don't come to anything,

52
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:30,974
you tell them they are real soldiers

53
00:07:45,329 --> 00:07:47,329
And I respect them.

54
00:07:47,329 --> 00:07:50,329
So you found your cause?

55
00:07:50,328 --> 00:07:52,008
Shut up, bitch

56
00:07:55,326 --> 00:07:56,606
Sorry, guys, sorry.

57
00:08:06,323 --> 00:08:09,323
Don't. No need to cry

58
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:13,322
You're an officer's wife, you don't have the right

59
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:14,160
I know.

60
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,879
Take care of Sasha

61
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:25,317
Vera,

62
00:08:25,317 --> 00:08:28,317
you'll wait for me.

63
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:29,876
I promise you, I won't forget you

64
00:08:38,313 --> 00:08:40,313
Don't promahnis

65
00:08:40,312 --> 00:08:41,432
I'll try, for you

66
00:08:53,308 --> 00:08:57,308
Their boots need to come off

67
00:08:57,307 --> 00:08:58,627
Get them off

68
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:51,271
Hey, bros!

69
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:52,271
What brings you here?

70
00:10:52,271 --> 00:10:55,271
What about you?

71
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,150
I told you, my own reasons

72
00:11:00,268 --> 00:11:01,468
Oh, cool

73
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:05,267
We don't know where we're going,

74
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:07,267
which way is east, which way west, hell if you can figure it.

75
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,266
You can hear artillery to the east, that's the way to go

76
00:11:09,265 --> 00:11:11,265
Yeah, you can hear it to the north and to the south, too.

77
00:11:11,265 --> 00:11:12,265
War all around.

78
00:11:12,264 --> 00:11:14,264
And who do you belong to?

79
00:11:14,264 --> 00:11:15,264
Goryanov's 117th Brigade, Rifle,

80
00:11:15,263 --> 00:11:17,263
202nd Regiment.

81
00:11:17,263 --> 00:11:18,263
And you?

82
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:20,263
I'm from the 32nd rifle corps,

83
00:11:20,262 --> 00:11:24,262
Khomichev -- he's from the 93rd Rifle Division, 96th Regiment

84
00:11:24,261 --> 00:11:26,261
I'm from the 37th Division, 101st Regiment. I commanded a battalion.

85
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,260
Bros, have you got a crumb to spare?

86
00:11:28,259 --> 00:11:30,259
Whatever's over there; we finished off the last breadrolls yesterday.

87
00:11:30,259 --> 00:11:32,259
We've been going on what berries we could find,

88
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:34,258
Our stomachs are sticking to our spines.

89
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:35,898
Yes, we also live here on mushrooms

90
00:12:18,244 --> 00:12:20,244
Iz you, all in krovischi,

91
00:12:20,243 --> 00:12:22,243
The commander of each?

92
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:24,242
See two sleepers, Major.

93
00:12:24,242 --> 00:12:26,242
Not occupant, he would wash the wound

94
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:27,681
Is there any water?

95
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:03,230
Have to go get it.

96
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:05,230
Where? And? They'll spot us right away.

97
00:13:05,229 --> 00:13:06,229
Yeah, to hell with them, too,

98
00:13:06,229 --> 00:13:08,229
I heard they had orders not to get held up,

99
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:10,228
not to get bogged down in local fighting.

100
00:13:10,227 --> 00:13:12,227
To make straight for Stalingrad.

101
00:13:12,227 --> 00:13:14,227
And where did you hear that?

102
00:13:14,226 --> 00:13:15,226
When we broke out of the encirclement,

103
00:13:15,226 --> 00:13:19,226
we grabbed one Fritz.  He said it.

104
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:21,425
Well look at this guy. On your head be it, let's go, guys.

105
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:17,208
Bitches... still laughing

106
00:14:17,206 --> 00:14:20,206
Guys, can we take a break, I can't go any longer.

107
00:14:20,205 --> 00:14:23,205
And through you can not, from now zhahnut
machine, rest.

108
00:14:23,205 --> 00:14:25,205
No, well, what a bunch of pussies. Eat.

109
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:26,964
Let them eat instead of shooting, and thanks for that.

110
00:15:09,190 --> 00:15:12,190
And what else happened? Tverdokhlebov?

111
00:15:12,189 --> 00:15:15,189
Vasily Stepanovich.

112
00:15:15,188 --> 00:15:17,188
They scattered into the forest,

113
00:15:17,188 --> 00:15:19,188
I can't remember after that -

114
00:15:19,187 --> 00:15:23,187
I was unconscious almost the whole time.

115
00:15:23,186 --> 00:15:28,186
Alright then.  Better if you tell about the execution.

116
00:15:28,184 --> 00:15:30,184
I've already told you about that.

117
00:15:30,184 --> 00:15:32,184
Go into more detail.

118
00:15:32,183 --> 00:15:36,183
How is it that they shot you, and you are here, alive.

119
00:15:36,182 --> 00:15:39,182
Shooting wasn't enough

120
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:41,181
Not enough?

121
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:43,180
You ended up with

122
00:15:43,179 --> 00:15:47,179
Two bullets, in the chest and in the arm.

123
00:15:47,178 --> 00:15:49,178
Just got lucky, apparently?

124
00:15:49,178 --> 00:15:54,178
Depends on how you look at it.

125
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:57,176
I Don't you understand Comrade Investigator.

126
00:15:57,175 --> 00:16:01,175
Citizen Investigator.

127
00:16:01,174 --> 00:16:06,174
Sorry, Citizen Investigator.

128
00:16:06,172 --> 00:16:09,172
Well see here, former major, you've painted me a fabulous picture,

129
00:16:09,171 --> 00:16:12,171
Taken prisoner how? Concussion. And you don't remember how you were hit?

130
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:15,170
Executed, and crawled up still alive from the grave?

131
00:16:15,169 --> 00:16:16,249
Miraculous.  If only.

132
00:16:18,169 --> 00:16:19,169
You do not believe me?

133
00:16:19,168 --> 00:16:21,168
I do not.

134
00:16:21,168 --> 00:16:24,168
I have to listen to so many wild tales here, my ears are swollen.

135
00:16:24,167 --> 00:16:26,167
Pletete seven West to the heavens and all the forest.

136
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:30,166
And where is the proof, where are the concrete facts?

137
00:16:30,165 --> 00:16:32,165
What will happen to me?

138
00:16:32,164 --> 00:16:34,164
You yourself admit you were captured?

139
00:16:34,164 --> 00:16:35,164
I was.

140
00:16:35,163 --> 00:16:39,163
Now this is a concrete fact.

141
00:16:39,162 --> 00:16:42,162
And you have read Comrade Stalin's order number 227?

142
00:16:42,161 --> 00:16:43,161
I read it.

143
00:16:43,161 --> 00:16:45,161
So now you see who you are?

144
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,160
You are an enemy of the people. You have betrayed the homeland -- you follow?

145
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:51,159
...which is, at this moment, in danger.

146
00:16:51,158 --> 00:16:54,158
Now think, what should be done with you.

147
00:16:54,157 --> 00:16:57,157
I came back to my own side.

148
00:16:57,156 --> 00:17:00,156
That depends on where you're looking from. You went to your own or to the other.

149
00:17:00,155 --> 00:17:04,155
Maybe you were sent back on a spying mission.

150
00:17:04,154 --> 00:17:07,154
And everything else is just a beautiful tale.

151
00:17:07,153 --> 00:17:09,153
Executed, remained alive.

152
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:11,153
Came back to your own side.

153
00:17:11,152 --> 00:17:16,152
So you'll shoot me again?

154
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:19,150
That depends on you, Tverdokhlebov.

155
00:17:19,149 --> 00:17:20,149
Confess, tell the whole truth, bare your soul,

156
00:17:20,149 --> 00:17:24,149
you'll do a stretch in chervonets

157
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:26,148
But be a stubborn mule,

158
00:17:26,147 --> 00:17:28,147
shlepnem, soul for miles.

159
00:17:28,147 --> 00:17:30,147
Do you realize how many tale-tellers come through here??,

160
00:17:30,146 --> 00:17:31,146
Tens so of thousands.

161
00:17:31,146 --> 00:17:32,466
A river of people.

162
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:38,144
And you, flea, write them all up as traitors?

163
00:17:38,143 --> 00:17:40,143
What did you say?

164
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,103
Kopytov!

165
00:17:43,142 --> 00:17:45,142
Work him over some.

166
00:17:45,141 --> 00:17:46,141
Then you'll cooperate.

167
00:18:14,132 --> 00:18:16,132
Och, they've knocked your conscience out of you.

168
00:18:16,132 --> 00:18:17,692
They tried.

169
00:18:22,130 --> 00:18:26,130
Careful.  Head.

170
00:18:26,128 --> 00:18:27,128
Easy, easy.

171
00:18:27,128 --> 00:18:29,128
What happened next?

172
00:18:29,127 --> 00:18:31,127
And what next? We got out of the encirclement.

173
00:18:31,127 --> 00:18:31,847
"We" who?

174
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:36,126
Whoever was still alive,

175
00:18:36,125 --> 00:18:38,125
Fomichev was with me the whole time,

176
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:39,125
Kobylko,

177
00:18:39,124 --> 00:18:42,124
Yes.  Out of the whole regiment, less than a hundred were left.

178
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:44,123
Who can confirm this?

179
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:48,123
The same Fomichev and Kobylko

180
00:18:48,122 --> 00:18:51,122
Others bailed out on the road back.

181
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:55,121
Many were killed when we broke through the front.

182
00:18:55,119 --> 00:18:57,119
Alexei Loshilin,

183
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,119
Ignat Boiko,

184
00:18:59,118 --> 00:19:00,118
Ivan Stekolnikov,

185
00:19:00,118 --> 00:19:02,118
Can't remember them all.

186
00:19:02,117 --> 00:19:04,117
That's enough.

187
00:19:04,117 --> 00:19:07,117
But in his testimony Loshilin writes that

188
00:19:07,116 --> 00:19:11,116
you encouraged Red Army soldiers to surrender into captivity.

189
00:19:11,114 --> 00:19:13,114
It was over, you told them, the war was already lost,

190
00:19:13,114 --> 00:19:15,114
continuing to resist would be too expensive.

191
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:19,113
Who, Loshilin?

192
00:19:19,112 --> 00:19:21,112
Yes. That can not be.

193
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:21,951
Here. Read.

194
00:19:42,105 --> 00:19:44,105
Here&#39;s creation.

195
00:19:44,104 --> 00:19:47,104
Well, that Dubinin?

196
00:19:47,103 --> 00:19:52,103
Are we going to tell the truth, or tell some more tales?

197
00:19:52,101 --> 00:19:54,101
Burykin

198
00:19:54,101 --> 00:19:57,101
Give your tale how you fell prisoner.

199
00:19:57,100 --> 00:20:01,100
We fought to guard the battalion.

200
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:04,099
Holding our position, the Germans came down on us.

201
00:20:04,098 --> 00:20:07,098
I was knocked flat.  Came to with three automatics pointed at me.

202
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:09,097
And what did you do?

203
00:20:09,096 --> 00:20:14,096
What would you have done, with three rifles in your face?

204
00:20:14,095 --> 00:20:17,095
And if there weren't three Germans, but a whole company, what then?

205
00:20:17,094 --> 00:20:20,094
What then?

206
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:24,093
You were ordered to protect the battalion,

207
00:20:24,091 --> 00:20:27,771
and you hid quietly -- the Germans would have easily wiped out half the battalion from your position.

208
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,090
You should have screamed, "Germans!".

209
00:20:31,089 --> 00:20:32,089
Warned your own.

210
00:20:32,089 --> 00:20:34,089
And then they'd have massacred me.

211
00:20:34,088 --> 00:20:37,088
Massacred, of course.  But you would have warned the battalion?

212
00:20:37,087 --> 00:20:37,927
But you're a coward?

213
00:20:42,086 --> 00:20:44,086
I'm no coward,

214
00:20:44,085 --> 00:20:46,085
but to think for a few seconds?

215
00:20:46,085 --> 00:20:50,085
But should you think if you are a Red Army soldier?

216
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:53,083
Who are you then?

217
00:20:53,082 --> 00:20:54,042
You are a coward and a traitor.

218
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:05,080
So you'll write all of them up as enemies of the people? Sychev?

219
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:08,079
Well, what kind of enemies of the people are they, goddamn it?

220
00:21:08,078 --> 00:21:09,118
Spies, saboteurs.

221
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:19,076
Here's this Tverdokhlebov, also a saboteur?

222
00:21:19,074 --> 00:21:24,074
He lies expertly, Comrade Major, spins a fine yarn.

223
00:21:24,073 --> 00:21:27,073
Piss off.  I'm saying what actually happened.

224
00:21:27,072 --> 00:21:29,072
Are the wounds still on your body?

225
00:21:29,071 --> 00:21:32,071
Yes indeed, they are, two bullets.

226
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:37,070
Like I said, just what happened.

227
00:21:37,069 --> 00:21:39,069
The front is catastrophically lacking men -- you understand this, Sychev?

228
00:21:39,068 --> 00:21:41,068
Yes Sir, Comrade Major, I understand.

229
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:41,947
The fuck you understand.

230
00:21:46,066 --> 00:21:49,066
All people have flaws.  Before the Soviet Government,

231
00:21:49,065 --> 00:21:51,065
anyone might commit a crime, but an insignificant crime.

232
00:21:51,064 --> 00:21:56,064
And you want to have them all shot.

233
00:21:56,063 --> 00:21:59,063
I tell you, we need people on the damn front.

234
00:21:59,062 --> 00:22:01,062
So let them redeem their guilt before the motherland

235
00:22:01,061 --> 00:22:03,061
with blood, on the front.

236
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:05,060
Do you get me, Sychev?

237
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,060
Perfectly, Comrade Major, I do.

238
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,059
It took long enough.

239
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,739
Like talking to a giraffe.

240
00:22:14,057 --> 00:22:17,057
Well now, Citizen Vasily Stepanovich Tverdokhlebov?

241
00:22:17,056 --> 00:22:18,056
How are you feeling?

242
00:22:18,056 --> 00:22:18,896
Your wounds have healed?

243
00:22:24,054 --> 00:22:25,054
Thank you

244
00:22:25,054 --> 00:22:27,054
I'm ready to be shot now

245
00:22:27,053 --> 00:22:28,253
Why do you say that?

246
00:22:28,852 --> 00:22:36,052
The authorities not only punish, but also give opportunity.  To redeem your guilt before your homeland.

247
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:38,330
There's a war going on, Major, and you are being given

248
00:22:38,329 --> 00:22:41,049
the opportunity to redeem your guilt with blood.

249
00:22:41,049 --> 00:22:43,049
Will you command a penalty battalion?

250
00:22:43,048 --> 00:22:46,048
Certainly, there are men for it?

251
00:22:46,047 --> 00:22:47,047
And I've been demoted.

252
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:53,047
We don't have enough officers to fill our officer posts.

253
00:22:53,045 --> 00:22:56,045
Yes, and who the hell wants to command penal rabble?

254
00:22:56,044 --> 00:22:59,044
We understand each other. We can violate the statute.

255
00:22:59,043 --> 00:23:02,043
You can yourself?

256
00:23:02,042 --> 00:23:04,042
I am ready to, Citizen Major.

257
00:23:04,041 --> 00:23:05,241
Sure, then. Fine.

258
00:23:09,040 --> 00:23:12,040
In the penal battalion, you will have the chance

259
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:15,039
to redeem your guilt through fire.

260
00:23:15,038 --> 00:23:15,918
ATTENTION PRISONERS!

261
00:23:20,036 --> 00:23:23,036
THE FASCISTS DREAM OF DEFEATING US,

262
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:27,035
AND HAS THROWN ALL MANNER OF NEW SOLDIERS TO THE FRONT.

263
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:29,034
THE PARTY AND THE SOVIET GOVERNMENT,

264
00:23:29,033 --> 00:23:31,033
SHOWING GREAT CONFIDENCE IN YOU,

265
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:33,033
OFFER YOU THE POSSIBILITY,

266
00:23:33,032 --> 00:23:38,032
TO REDEEM YOUR GUILT WITH BLOOD, TO PUT YOUR CRIMES BEHIND YOU.

267
00:23:38,031 --> 00:23:43,031
Cram that up their asses sideways.

268
00:23:43,029 --> 00:23:48,029
WHOEVER WANTS TO GO TO THE FRONT, TAKE THREE STEPS FORWARD.

269
00:23:48,028 --> 00:23:52,028
Commies are scraping the bottom of the barrel,

270
00:23:52,026 --> 00:23:56,026
they see their German counterparts, and can't stop them.

271
00:23:56,025 --> 00:24:00,025
What, they've run completely out of soldiers, and now they're dragging zeks to the front?

272
00:24:00,024 --> 00:24:03,024
Shut your yap, they'll hear you.

273
00:24:03,023 --> 00:24:07,023
Нехай listen.

274
00:24:07,022 --> 00:24:14,022
So they'll be fighting under guard, too?

275
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:19,019
You can fight I thee two krasnoperyh
with machine guns guard.

276
00:24:19,018 --> 00:24:28,018
Check it out, all the politicals stepped up.

277
00:24:28,015 --> 00:24:30,015
Sheep, screw 'em.

278
00:24:30,014 --> 00:24:33,014
Enthusiasts

279
00:24:33,013 --> 00:24:36,013
On the front, if your rifle misfires,

280
00:24:36,012 --> 00:24:38,012
you'll bring your sentence on yourself.

281
00:24:38,012 --> 00:24:42,012
shooting without justification,

282
00:24:42,011 --> 00:24:44,011
remember what I'm saying

283
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:46,010
You hear?

284
00:24:46,009 --> 00:24:47,249
No one will repeat this

285
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:06,243
Look, PAHAN went up

286
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:16,840
Ah well, let's go

287
00:25:29,996 --> 00:25:32,996
You do in the law, Glymov

288
00:25:32,995 --> 00:25:36,995
you never worked, and now you want to go to the front,

289
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,993

291

There smallness not work,

292
00:25:44,991 --> 00:25:46,991
Glymov there, the whole will have to reel.

293
00:25:46,990 --> 00:25:48,990
But it will have as much.

294
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,990
ATTENTION PRISONERS

295
00:25:50,989 --> 00:25:52,989

Next, push trigger lock and paste.

303
00:26:46,971 --> 00:26:50,971
In the kind Hitler Kaput.

304
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:52,970
That is so clear?

305

Let us for the work rebyatki.

306

In response, understood?

307

And this much garbage?

308

In response, I&#39;m ready!

309
00:27:18,961 --> 00:27:19,961
Молодец.

310
00:27:19,961 --> 00:27:21,961
We as a chemist.

311
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:24,960
For example, 200 times to collect and disassemble.

312
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:25,960
How much?

313
00:27:25,959 --> 00:27:27,959
You че afonorel, commander?

314
00:27:27,959 --> 00:27:30,959
I said 200 times to collect and disassemble.

315
00:27:30,958 --> 00:27:32,958
What would kill, a student must,

316
00:27:32,957 --> 00:27:34,957
zeki my home.

317
00:27:36,476 --> 00:27:40,476
Yes, to fight, not to steal.

318
00:27:40,475 --> 00:27:43,475
And how do you think?

319
00:27:43,474 --> 00:27:47,474
And you where citizens?

320
00:27:47,472 --> 00:27:50,472
And we are for civil war, these closures do not
one hundred times before and collected.

321

And that same machine-guns and know?

And many among you?

Then free, was the only on the shooting.

328
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:09,467
The rest continue.

329
00:28:09,466 --> 00:28:10,466
That&#39;s fortunate 58 - m.

330
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:15,985
And wait, wait.

331
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,439

00:29:36,438 --> 00:29:40,438
Please.

And I thought, you have to judge Glymov.

408
00:36:21,311 --> 00:36:23,311
It is that whether you are going to judge me?

409
00:36:23,311 --> 00:36:28,311
Why? The Tribunal.

410

00:42:43,192 --> 00:42:46,192
there by the blood flow,

483
00:42:46,191 --> 00:42:49,191
People are dying there,

For violation of military discipline, shooting!

494

During the demonstration cowardice, shooting!

495
