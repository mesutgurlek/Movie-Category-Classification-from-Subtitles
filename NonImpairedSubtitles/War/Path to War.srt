1
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,700
Congratulations, Mr. President.

2
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,100
Just the beginnin, Bob.

3
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,900
Sir! Mr. President, over here, please.

4
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,000
Thank you.

5
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,700
She is pretty.

6
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,700
Havin a good time, George?

7
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,400
Great night, Mr. President.

8
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:33,800
What a night.

9
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Senator Dirksen,

10
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,600
the President would be delighted

11
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:47,000
if you'd join him in the Oval Office
after the ball.

12
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:48,000
I will.

13
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,200
One thing I can say
about the Great Society:

14
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,000
it sure is crowded!

15
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,200
Up all night writing this one, Dick?

16
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,200
Uh, this is one speech
I'll gladly disavow.

17
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,900
Got a clippin here.

18
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:42,900
Quotes my honorable defeated opponent,
Senator Goldwater.

19
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:48,300
Calls my Secretary of Defense
an IBM machine with legs!

20
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,400
Outrageous!

21
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,900
Now, I stand here tonight
to tell you this,

22
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,400
that I regard Bob McNamara here

23
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,700
as not only one of the smartest

24
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,500
but one of the most humane men I know.

25
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,700
Right here.

26
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:26,600
And that goes
for all my blue ribbon men

27
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,300
you see here tonight.

28
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,100
Never in our history

29
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:34,700
has there been such
an abundance of brain and talent,

30
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,800
why I've got three
our four Rhodes scholars,

31
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,600
four or five graduates of Harvard,

32
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,300
a couple from Yale, and why,

33
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,200
there's even one here tonight

34
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:48,700
from Southwest Texas
State Teachers College!

35
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,700
And don't you know,
that one rules the roost!

36
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,800
Thank you.

37
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,900
Watch broken, Jack?

38
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Timin it.

39
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,900
Timin what?

40
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,600
The applause. He'll ask.

41
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,400
In a land of great wealth,

42
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,000
families must not live
in hopeless poverty.

43
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,000
In a land rich in harvest,

44
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,200
children just must not go hungry.

45
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:41,900
In a land of healing miracles,

46
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:46,600
neighbors must not suffer
and die unattended.

47
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,100
In a great land of learning
and scholars,

48
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,700
young people must be taught
to read and write.

49
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,800
A bit more volume, please,
Mr. President.

50
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,800
I want to hear every brilliant word

51
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,700
that Dick Goodwin wrote
for your marvelous speech.

52
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,200
Goodwin!? Who told you Goodwin wrote
that speech?

53
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,000
A dozen people work on my speeches,

54
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,500
and nobody more than I do.

55
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,400
Why Jack here's been writin some
of my best stuff for seven years.

56
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,200
My penance for marryin away
his last secretary.

57
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,900
But, thank you for the credit,
Mr. President.

58
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
All right, good night, Jack.

59
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,100
Good night, Mr. President.

60
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:18,900
Good night, Senator.

61
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,300
Good night, Jack.

62
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,200
Yeah, Goodwin wrote
maybe a word or two.

63
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,800
Mhm. Great being one.

64
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,200
Society the other.

65
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,500
Smart sonovabitch got
that out of a book.

66
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,700
Now, listen to me, Ev and listen well.

67
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,600
You're a good friend,

68
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,800
I don't want to see
you retire prematurely.

69
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,100
But as this reception
plainly shows you,

70
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,000
the American people ain't
gonna stand for you

71
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,400
fellahs in the other side
of the isle draggin your feet

72
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,100
in any of my programs.

73
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,300
Now, FDR passed a handful of bills

74
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,600
in his first hundred days.

75
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,300
I'm gonna pass a bucketful.

76
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,500
Poverty, education, healthcare.

77
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:59,900
I'm gonna finish what I started
on Civil Rights, too.

78
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,800
I'm tellin ya, Jim Crow put a collar
on more smart men,

79
00:08:02,900 --> 00:08:05,200
sure as they were sentenced
to an Illinois chain gang.

80
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:07,500
Whoa-whoa-whoa. I take offense, sir.

81
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,000
We are most humane to our condemned.

82
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:12,200
The Great Society
is my beautiful woman, Ev,

83
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,100
and I'm takin her by the arm.

84
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,700
And as the greatest republican leader
in this century,

85
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,900
Edward Dirksen's gonna take her
by the other

86
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,400
and help me escort that lady home.

87
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,300
Yes, and knowing what is likely
thence to ensue, Mr. President,

88
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,500
that is where I shall take my leave.

89
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,700
Lyndon, I apologize for interruptin,

90
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,700
I thought
perhaps you'd like some sandwiches

91
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,100
from the kitchen.

92
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:38,100
Mrs. Johnson, my most abject apology.

93
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,100
I have kept your husband far too long

94
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,900
on this most festive occasion.

95
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,200
No.

96
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:48,200
Mr. President,
my heartfelt congratulations, sir.

97
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,300
Outta here.

98
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,100
Good night.
Good night.

99
00:08:53,200 --> 00:09:01,900
...in abundance of what we'e learned
from heartache.

100
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,000
Democracy rests upon the people.

101
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:09,300
Freedom is a gift,

102
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
the judgment is God's...

103
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,500
It was a wonderful speech.

104
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,800
Full of such hope and promise.

105
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:17,400
Dick Goodwin asked what I thought

106
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,000
and I told him it
was a magnificent job.

107
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,600
And you delivered it so very well.

108
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,000
Thank you, honey.
Yes, you did

109
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,300
Nine p.m. unless you hear from me.

110
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,200
Good morning. How are you?

111
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:59,300
Yes, thank you
Good morning.

112
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,000
Good morning.

113
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,800
Good morning, Mr. Secretary.

114
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,500
What have we got here?
A crisis in every capital?

115
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,400
Uh, just one.

116
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,600
This is one cable?

117
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,800
Not quite.

118
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,700
Here's the rest of it.

119
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:24,600
The situation in Viet Nam
is continuing to deteriorate,

120
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:26,400
we've been able
to keep the noise level down

121
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,800
since your campaign but

122
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,400
my guess is you'll be faced
with a tough decision soon.

123
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,000
How soon?
I've got 19 million older folks

124
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,400
can't see a doctor,

125
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,600
33 million under the poverty line,

126
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,800
I can't have Congress distracted.

127
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,700
Now how soon, Bob?

128
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,700
Very soon, Mr. President.

129
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,800
I hate to have to report this to you,

130
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,700
but Max Taylor says here that

131
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,700
Vietcong enlistment
is increasing rapidly

132
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,300
and that uh,
Saigon can't continue must longer

133
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,400
to provide security
for our advisors down there

134
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,500
and fight an insurgency
at the same time.

135
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,100
Why not?

136
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,600
How many men does South Vietnam
have out there fightin ?

137
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,200
Two hundred thousand.
VC have about thirtyfour thousand.

138
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, how the hell
can thirty-four thousand

139
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,100
lick two hundred thousand?

140
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:10,400
Well, historically a ten
to one ratio minimum is required

141
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,800
for a guerrilla situation
and there's no way

142
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,700
that South Vietnam can achieve
that on their own.

143
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,200
Now, we've kept our powder dry through
the elections and holidays

144
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,900
waiting for some stability
in the South,

145
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,600
waiting for the cycle of coups to end,

146
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,100
during which we've had five killed

147
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,600
in the attack at Bien Hoa,

148
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:27,300
two at our Saigon officers quarters
and scores wounded

149
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,700
with no retaliation
from us whatsoever.

150
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,300
Now, Wheeler, the other Chiefs,

151
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,300
Westmoreland are fit to be tied,

152
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,300
as you know, and now this
from Ambassador Taylor.

153
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,600
You might send Mac Bundy to Saigon
to have a talk with him,

154
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,700
I'd make another trip myself,

155
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,000
but I'm in the middle of the defense
budget right now.

156
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,000
I don't want to see the word
Vietnam in that damn budget.

157
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,500
You know I'd do that if I could.
In fact,

158
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,700
it's becoming increasingly difficult
to conceal--

159
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,000
Bob, all I want to know is this:

160
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,300
What's it gonna take to get
Ho Chi Minh to quit?

161
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,900
That's all I wanna know.

162
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,700
Mr. President, it's clear to me now
that the answer

163
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,000
is sustained military action
in the air

164
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,100
and if that doesn't work
on the ground.

165
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,500
This is the decision you
are going to have to face,

166
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:21,000
Mr. President and as I said,
very soon I'm afraid.

167
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,400
Keep me up to date, Bob.

168
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,900
Turn that thing off.
Yes, sir.

169
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,200
This Medicare speech is shit.

170
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,100
Cut out the gobbledygook
and sex it up.

171
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,400
Maybe Goodwin aughta
take a crack at it.

172
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,200
Goodwin's got three months
of assignments.

173
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,700
Oh, I just put the last of those
on your desk, Mr. President.

174
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,800
I'd be glad to look it over

175
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,700
if you'd like me to.
All right.

176
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,400
Put the music to it, Dick.

177
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,900
Jack, I want you to tell him
to stop taking credit

178
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,400
for every goddamn word I say.

179
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,700
Absolutely, Mr. President.

180
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,600
All right.

181
00:12:57,100 --> 00:12:59,300
Come on, out you go.

182
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,800
Schedule me a hair cut.

183
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:06,600
Surely.

184
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,400
And see if you can get
Clark Clifford here for dinner.

185
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,700
Converting from Protestant
to Catholic is a big step.

186
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:20,000
Actually Lyndon took it
better than I did.

187
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,800
I was quite surprised.

188
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,600
Well, both you and Daddy
changed your religions.

189
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,000
From one Protestant denomination
to another.

190
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:28,000
It was a matter of convenience,
and schoolin and

191
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:29,900
I don't think religion should be
a matter of convenience.

192
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
And this is a private matter, Luci.

193
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:34,500
You're finishing up at Texas,
aren't you, Lynda?

194
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,400
Next year, Ma am.

195
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,000
She's dating George Hamilton,
you know.

196
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:37,800
The actor?

197
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,600
Yes.

198
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,300
With the tan?

199
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:42,000
And your sister may consider
that a private matter, too.

200
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,000
Oh, mother, you must be joking.

201
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,400
Come on now, damn it,
what's the reason this time?

202
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,400
I don't have the qualifications
to be CIA director.

203
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,000
I decide the qualifications.

204
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:56,800
You had all the qualifications to be
Attorney General, didn't ya,

205
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:58,400
to succeed Bobby Kennedy.

206
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,600
Yeah.

207
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,400
Yeah, and here I am stuck
with a friend of his, Katzenbach.

208
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,600
He's excellent.

209
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,900
Ah, well all right you told me
your interest is foreign affairs.

210
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,200
Well, that's where I need your help,
foreign affairs.

211
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,400
What is CIA but foreign affairs?

212
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,900
I think my skills would better serve
you in foreign policy,

213
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,200
Mr. President, not foreign intrigue.

214
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:21,400
I hear you billed a million dollars
last year,

215
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,800
First lawyer in the country
to do that. True?

216
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,200
Well,
that's what five percent came to.

217
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,200
Well then, you can afford to take
a hiatus from all this money-makin,

218
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,700
come serve your president.

219
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,700
I don't think you need an attorney,
old friend.

220
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,500
I think you need a magician.

221
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,100
A magician?

222
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:42,100
Yes. Someone who can make
a small corner of

223
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,600
Southeast Asia disappear.

224
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:47,400
President Kennedy
did not lose South Vietnam

225
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,300
and I'm not gonna lose South Vietnam.

226
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,400
I kept all these people on,
they assured me,

227
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,000
told me to stick it out.

228
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,700
Now, that little sonovabitch Bobby
is just hovering

229
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,000
to swoop down and reclaim the mantle
if I fail.

230
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,500
He'll hang me from my left ball,

231
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:02,900
Goldwater hang me from my right.

232
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,100
That is complete nonsense.

233
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,700
You humiliated Goldwater
in the election.

234
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,500
The entire Right wing is in disarray,

235
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:13,300
Bobby is a freshman Senator
with no record.

236
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,300
His brother was a no record
Senator too, wasn't he,

237
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,700
when he came out of no where?

238
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,300
Daddy?

239
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,800
Would you like some desert
or are you on your diet?

240
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,700
Oh, now, now, you save some
for me if it's good.

241
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,100
How about you, Mr. Clifford?
No, thank you.

242
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,500
No, he's not gettin anything tonight.

243
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:40,200
Now, Jack Kennedy put sixteen
thousand advisers in there,

244
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,000
I put in another eight.

245
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,700
We've got twentyfour thousand men

246
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,200
teachin them people how to shoot
and fly planes.

247
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
We've got patrols
and covert operations,

248
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,300
we've got an alphabet
soup of aid programs,

249
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:52,600
a lot of which I'd like
to have right here

250
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,500
and none of it's workin

251
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,900
because with all this coup shit

252
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,800
it's like buildin bricks
with no mortar down there,

253
00:15:57,900 --> 00:16:00,300
there's nothin real to hang it all on.

254
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,300
Now, Ho Chi Minh knows this

255
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,200
and he's gonna keep his people
attackin until there's nothin left.

256
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,600
Now, if we call it quits
and continue as we are,

257
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,100
South Vietnam, maybe
the whole of Southeast

258
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Asia goes communist.

259
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,500
Eh-eh, now even George
all admits that.

260
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,300
Everybody else thinks we aught
to up the ante.

261
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,700
Bombing?

262
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,800
Look at this.

263
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:31,400
A bunch of sheds,
just outside on the water.

264
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,600
And they call that a military target.

265
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:35,500
There's school right up the street,

266
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,800
Poles built it for em.

267
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,300
Hell, Clark, I could build em a
thousand damn schools.

268
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:46,200
I'd like you to start to follow
the situation down there,

269
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,800
read some of these reports
they keep throwin at me.

270
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:52,400
Eh, I just don't know what to believe
any more biggest damn mess.

271
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:55,600
And bein on the outside
you could take a fresh look.

272
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,400
I'll do everything I can to help.

273
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,300
Yeah, except come work for me.

274
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,600
Hey, what about the Supreme Court,

275
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,700
what if a seat opens up?

276
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm an advocate, I'm not a judge.

277
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:09,600
Hell, Clark, you're a hick lawyer
from Missouri.

278
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,800
Well, I may be a hick lawyer
from Missouri,

279
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,800
But as you yourself pointed out
I haven't made

280
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,700
Missouri wages for a long, long time.

281
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,800
You know,

282
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I ran sayin I was for peace,
now sure as hell,

283
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:27,000
they're tellin me I gotta do
what I said I wasn't gonna do.

284
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,600
What Goldwater was gonna do.

285
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,300
Luci's converting to Catholicism.

286
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,100
Big decision for a young girl.

287
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,000
He told me.
He said when the press gets wind

288
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,700
they'll make it sound
as if she did it

289
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,600
as a tribute to the Kennedy's.

290
00:17:52,100 --> 00:17:54,700
I swear
I think he was only half joking.

291
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,500
Clark?

292
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:24,200
Hello? I'm sorry, he's asleep.

293
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:25,300
He just got over neumonia,

294
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,000
I'd rather not wake him.

295
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,900
I... I know, is it possible...

296
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,000
Marg?

297
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:38,500
Sorry, Bob, must be pretty damn bad
to keep you at home.

298
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,300
Let's just call it the Hanoi flu.

299
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,700
What the hell's goin on here?

300
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,600
General.

301
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,700
Corps Head Quarters at Pleiku.

302
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,500
Vietcong cut through the wire,

303
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,900
blew up our advisers barracks,

304
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:50,800
planes and choppers on the runway
and Camp Holloway.

305
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,300
Casualty report.
More of the same,

306
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,700
advisers compound next door.

307
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,900
VC got in with mortar
and grenade launchers.

308
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,100
There are eight dead, a hundred
and twenty plus wounded,

309
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,600
six choppers, one transport destroyed
other aircraft severely damaged.

310
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,900
Mr. Secretary?

311
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:07,100
The National Security Advisors
in Saigon, is he not?

312
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,500
Didn't the CIA say Hanoi
would connect Bundy's visit

313
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,900
with a decision on bombing?

314
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,300
Vietcong agents in Saigon government

315
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
probably leaked it out.

316
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:18,300
And knowing this, knowing this look
what they did, Bob.

317
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,100
They blew up a hundred
and twentyeight people

318
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,800
just to thumb their noses at us.

319
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,100
Now what the hell
are we going to do about it?

320
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,300
Number 33, the North Vietnamese
barracks at

321
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:32,500
Dong Hoi just over the border
in North Vietnam,

322
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,300
about six thousand troops based there

323
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,900
An isolated facility
with minimal civilian support.

324
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,100
What are the expected casualties?

325
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,700
Thirty six hundred troops,
uh, roughly forty civilians.

326
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,200
How'd you come up with these numbers?

327
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:46,000
Sir, we take the approach, look at
the blast pattern,

328
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,100
size of the blast, demographics...

329
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:52,000
Mr. President, it's a sophisticated
an analysis as I've seen,

330
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,500
unprecedented in aerial warfare.

331
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,500
Well, Ho Chi Minh's not gonna
turn tail overnight.

332
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:00,500
Saigon's gonna take a shellackin
for anything we do.

333
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,400
And if they go
in now it'd be like sendin

334
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:05,200
in a widow woman to slap Jack Dempsey.

335
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,500
Sir, we doubt Hanoi will slap back.

336
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,000
Didn't MacArthur say the same thing

337
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,600
when a million Chinese poured
into Korea?

338
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,100
What does State think of this?

339
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,200
The risk of inaction
means more aggression,

340
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,900
Ambassador Taylor concurs.

341
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,200
He's meeting
with Saigon's leaders now

342
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,300
and should be calling
the Situation Room momentarily.

343
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,900
They'll put him through to me.

344
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,500
Mr. President, if I might.

345
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,400
I was in charge of

346
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,500
bombing survey's during World War'II,

347
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,200
And bombing never wins a war.

348
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,700
Rather than erode the enemy's
will it strengthens it,

349
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,200
we've seen this time and time again,

350
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,600
in the Blitz, Berlin.

351
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,000
Well, Blitz and Berlin
never woulda happened

352
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,600
If we didn't lay down
to Hitler's Munich.

353
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,700
And if we lay down now it'll be
the same thing again.

354
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:49,300
An open invitation to more
of their aggression.

355
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,400
Mr. President, what we're proposing
with Rolling

356
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,800
Thunder is a strictly limited program
of sustained retaliation

357
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:58,300
moving Northward only if Vietcong act
vity persists.

358
00:20:58,400 --> 00:20:59,800
But it will persist, Bob.

359
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,500
We'll be bombing their cities
before we know it,

360
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,500
now do we expect Russia to sit still
for that? Or China?

361
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,800
Comparisons with Korea fifteen years
ago are flimsy at best, Mr. President.

362
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,000
You are absolutely right.

363
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,800
China has atomic weapons now.

364
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:13,400
They tested their first bomb
four months ago,

365
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,600
it was no dud. We have no idea
what will set them off.

366
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,900
I, I don't understand.

367
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:20,400
Why is this?

368
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:24,500
North Vietnam has secret treaties
with the Chicoms, Mr. President.

369
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,500
We don't know what the flashpoints are

370
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,000
in their intervention.

371
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,600
We could take China out
in seventeen minutes.

372
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:32,500
They'd be crazy to take us on.

373
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:37,000
I agree, Bus, but why assume
they're as rational as we are?

374
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:40,300
Mr. President, four hundred Americans
have died in Vietnam,

375
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,000
and now eight more
in these atrocities,

376
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,800
there has to be a response
to this aggression.

377
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,700
Mr. President,

378
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:48,800
the Air Force
will be launching strikes

379
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
from the Danang airfield,

380
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:51,900
and that base will become

381
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,800
a more attractive target
to the Vietcong.

382
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,200
General Westmoreland is requesting
a Hawk missile battalion.

383
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,500
Is he asking for troops?

384
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,200
No. No troops.

385
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:01,700
Saigon will be responsible
for a base defense

386
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,300
but if the Vietcong activity
intensifies despite these measures,

387
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,500
they may need some help.

388
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,700
But it will intensify, Bob!

389
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,000
This is precisely my point,
Mr. President.

390
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:14,500
Yes?

391
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:17,600
Defense Secretary, Saigon,
Ambassador Taylor.

392
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,900
Put him through.

393
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:22,200
Max, we're all here with President
Go ahead.

394
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,600
Mr. President, gentlemen,

395
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:27,600
Saigon has agreed to the commencement
of air strikes.

396
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:31,000
They say their army's ready for any
counterattack from the North.

397
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,900
All right, Max. Thank you.

398
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:42,000
George... your concerns are mine,
as well as you know

399
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:44,800
but we're no where nea
the point you suggest,

400
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,500
and many here agree
there's a good chance

401
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:50,700
that Ho Chi Minh will quit
if we start makin him pay.

402
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,400
Now is there anyone here
who does not agree with this?

403
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:55,300
I'm concerned about the press.

404
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:57,300
They're gonna view this
as a change in policy.

405
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,000
There is no change in policy.

406
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,000
But we haven't struck back

407
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:02,100
since the Tonkin Gulf
affair six months ago.

408
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:02,800
That's right,

409
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,300
that's when I asked Congress
for the power,

410
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,300
they gave me the power,
now I'm usin it.

411
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,600
But we're takin it slow.

412
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,200
I'm not goin to Hanoi.

413
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,700
And I'm signin off on every target.

414
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,100
You're not gonna bomb
the smallest outhouse

415
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,700
without checking with me.

416
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,200
You understand, General?

417
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,800
We understand, Mr. President.

418
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,600
All right, Bob, you better get goin.

419
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,200
Now, anything else?

420
00:23:37,300 --> 00:23:39,200
From Robert'S. McNamara

421
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,700
to Admiral U.S. Grant Sharp, Commander
Pacific Forces, Honolulu.

422
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,800
This is an execution order.

423
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,400
During daylight hours,
7 February 1965, Saigon time,

424
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,400
conduct the following
coordinated attacks:

425
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,600
Number 33 X Dong Hoi barracks...

426
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,400
Good evening, Mr. President.

427
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:10,800
Planes back?

428
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:12,800
Uh, the carriers weren't on station
when the order went out, sir.

429
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,400
The operation has been delayed.

430
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,500
Delayed?

431
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,900
About ninety minutes, sir.
We should have word shortly.

432
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,000
At ease.

433
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:48,300
What happened?

434
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,600
It's monsoon season there, sir.

435
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:51,600
Well are they goin
or aren't they goin !?

436
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,800
You find out what the hell's goin on
and you call me.

437
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,700
Get the White House operator
to put you through.

438
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,600
You want me to wake you, sir?

439
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,000
You won't wake me!

440
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,700
Why you up?

441
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:08,900
Worried for you.

442
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,000
Those planes
should a been back hours ago.

443
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,400
What's that?

444
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,000
Letter from a friend complainin
about junkyards.

445
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,200
She says here...

446
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,600
they're all up
and down the highway now

447
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,800
through Dallas to San Antonio
and Houston to Austin...

448
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:31,000
Right on the highway
or away where people can't see?

449
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,600
No, right along the road defilin
the countryside.

450
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:37,100
Through Waxahachie and Hillboro,

451
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,700
and lovely San Marcos
where you went to school.

452
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:44,000
Oh. Love... don't.... Love.

453
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,600
Yes, Mr. President?

454
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:51,000
What are you do in about junkyards
on the highways?

455
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,700
What?
Junkyards!

456
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,800
Well, I'm sendin somethin over to
your office right now.

457
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,100
You jump in your car in your jammies
you might even beat it.

458
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:02,100
Yes?

459
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:04,900
I spoke with Honolulu,
they're cabling now.

460
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,100
Planes are back, the primary was hit.

461
00:26:08,300 --> 00:26:09,900
All the planes, they all get back?

462
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,300
Uh, no, sir.
I'm afraid we did lose one plane.

463
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,400
What about the pilot?

464
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,800
He went down at sea,

465
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,700
Search and Rescue
is looking for him now

466
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:20,700
but I'm afraid it's not looking
very good.

467
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,500
I'm sorry, sir.

468
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,900
All right, thank you, Bob.

469
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,500
Good night, Mr. President.

470
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,600
Yes, Mr. President?

471
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,400
Lyndon.

472
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,800
Oh, I'm sorry.

473
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,000
Put this on Moyer's desk.

474
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:41,200
Yes, sir.

475
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,700
Honey?

476
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:50,300
We lost a pilot.

477
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,400
Sweetheart.

478
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:59,800
Sweetheart. Oh, I'm so sorry.

479
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,500
This isn't about junkyards, is it?

480
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,600
Shit, what time is it?

481
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,900
I told Sandra I'd be home before one.

482
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,100
She didn't call.

483
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,100
That's not a good sign.

484
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,900
What about you, you coming or going?

485
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:29,700
He wants company.

486
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,500
We started bombing
North Vietnam tonight.

487
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:40,700
Christ. Are they talking about
combat troops?

488
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,100
No. Not yet.

489
00:27:43,300 --> 00:27:45,000
No.

490
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,900
Christ,
I don't know what to tell the press.

491
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:51,400
We are backing into a war here,
for Christ's sake

492
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:53,900
and it's a war he campaigned against.

493
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:56,600
But now,
he talks like he's puttin a paddle

494
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,600
to Ho Chi Minh's behind.

495
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,900
Nah, Johnson's a deal maker.

496
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,400
He's the best politician
this country's ever seen,

497
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,100
he'll find a way out of this.

498
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:09,200
Sure, we'll just get
old Uncle Ho down to the ranch,

499
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,800
serve him up some tasty barbecue

500
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,000
and then offer him a damn.

501
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,600
Or a Federal Judgeship.

502
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:16,400
Hello, Mr. President.

503
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,200
Good evening, Mr. President.

504
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:21,000
Congratulations on getting
that education bill out of committee.

505
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,300
Well, it hasn't passed yet, has it?

506
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,300
I want all ya up there
on the hill day and night

507
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,700
to get me those yeas.

508
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:27,700
What is this?

509
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,900
Tapioca puddin ?

510
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,100
Yes, sir.

511
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,200
Would you like it?

512
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,100
Ah, now, votin rights,

513
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,700
that's the meat in the coconut, boys.
Where do we stand?

514
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:40,800
Um, at last tally
we are short fifty congressmen.

515
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:41,800
But the Senate is--

516
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,800
Start with the house
give me the names.

517
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,800
You want me to read the roll,
Mr. President,

518
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,400
All four hundred and thirty-five?

519
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,000
From Abbitt of Virginia to Zablocki
of Wisconsin. Go.

520
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:06,800
Um, Abbit, Virginia, nay.

521
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Abernethy, Mississippi, nay.

522
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,900
Where do you think you're goin ?

523
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:13,500
Home.

524
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:14,400
The hell you are.

525
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,100
You're gonna relieve him
when he gives out.

526
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,100
Adair, Indiana, nay.

527
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:22,900
Adams, Washington yah.

528
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,800
Adabbo, New York, yah.

529
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,000
Albert, Okalahoma, yah.

530
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,300
Boys, it doesn't look like we're gonna
be able to get votin rights through.

531
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:32,500
Not this session.

532
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:35,100
Well, I must say I don't understand,
Mr. President.

533
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,100
Only a month ago in your State
of the Union message,

534
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,300
you made it perfect...
Reverend King,

535
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,200
I've been to the well
and the well has provided.

536
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:48,000
I got the votes on Medicare,
aid to education,

537
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,100
all these benefit the poor
and the disenfranchised

538
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:52,700
and you know who that is.

539
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:55,700
Please don't misunderstand,
we're very grateful, Mr. President.

540
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,900
Attorney General Katzenbach
here's written

541
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,000
a beautiful piece of legislation.

542
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:03,700
You think I wanna carry
that around in my ass pocket?

543
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:08,700
You see it's this,
this problem I got in Southeast Asia,

544
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:12,100
The Vietnamese to them Southerners
up on the Hill,

545
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,500
what are they but another bunch
of colored people.

546
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:19,300
And I go up there crawlin
for more aid as I must for Vietnam,

547
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,500
Mr. President,
old Wilbur Mills will say,

548
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,400
you're gonna have to raise taxes.

549
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,300
Declare war, call up the reserves.

550
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,700
And by the way, that's gonna
cost you your War on Poverty,

551
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,100
your votin rights for Negros.

552
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,000
Just like World War II
killed the New Deal,

553
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:37,200
well there ain't gonna
be World War III, I promise you.

554
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:40,700
I'm gonna nip this in the bud, I am.

555
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,100
And as soon as I do,

556
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:45,300
I'll send that bill up and more,
I promise you.

557
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,300
There will be no delay.

558
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:54,100
Well, Mr. President,
we're going to be down in Selma,

559
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,000
marching for the vote,

560
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,700
and we expect you'll take notice to
what we do down there.

561
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,400
During preparations for Martin Luther
King's second attempt

562
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,700
to march to Montgomery,

563
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:07,200
four white men beat to death
a Boston clergyman,

564
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:09,600
one of the fifteen hundred marchers.

565
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,400
The slain reverend, James Reed,

566
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,100
had come to Selma in solidarity
with Negroes attempting

567
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,600
to register to vote.

568
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,100
Amidst growing concern

569
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,100
about increasing racial violence
in Alabama,

570
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,700
Governor George Wallace
is reportedly preparing a trip to

571
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:24,200
Washington D.C. to see the President.

572
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:28,000
Meanwhile, demonstrations continue
in front of the White House.

573
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,500
Call em off!

574
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,200
Well, we didn't organize it,
Mr. President.

575
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:36,800
Call em off, get out there,
both of ya! Call em off!

576
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,900
Daddy?

577
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,600
Why you up?
Those goddamn agitators wake you?

578
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,500
No, I heard you yellin .

579
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:46,600
Oh, sorry, honey.

580
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:48,800
....always find ways to tell you
how it can't be done.

581
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,900
It ' still strange to us though
how millions of dollars

582
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,800
can be spent everyday to hold troops
in South Vietnam

583
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,800
and our country cannot protect
the rights of Negros

584
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,900
in Selma and Marian, Alabama!

585
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,400
He's outrageous!

586
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,700
So we have... Now! Now! Now!
Everything's gotta be now.

587
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,700
What they want
the whole goddamn world

588
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,400
with a fence around it?

589
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:15,000
I just gave Standby authorization
to Federalize the Alabama Guard,

590
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,400
we just need your order.

591
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,700
We have to do it, Mr. President.

592
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:19,200
Wallace won't protect those marchers.

593
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,300
Hold-hold on, you want me
to send troops into Alabama,

594
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,600
lose Stennis, Dirksen, Russell,

595
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:26,000
every conservative vote I got hangin
on a thread of a spittle!?

596
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:27,900
It'll be Reconstruction
all over again!

597
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,400
Hell, your friend Bobby Kennedy
coulda given me that advice!

598
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,800
Governor George Wallace
of the Alabama State Legislature...

599
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:35,700
Martin Luther King
and his group of procommunists

600
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:38,000
have instigated these demonstrations

601
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:41,100
by lawless nigger mobs in Birmingham.

602
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:45,000
But the law abidin citizens
of both races there are fed up

603
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:49,200
with this riotin and disruption
led by so-called clergy men

604
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:51,600
and their communist inspired values!

605
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,600
I am therefore sending two hundred
and fifty state

606
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,100
troopers into that city

607
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,900
supported y five hundred law
officers of this state.

608
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,100
I will meet our enemies face to face.
I will not surrender!

609
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:06,500
Mr. President,
Wallace is only coming up here

610
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,500
in order to placate you.

611
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,300
He wants things to get
so bad down there

612
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:10,800
that you have to put the troops in.

613
00:33:10,900 --> 00:33:13,200
Then he'll lambaste you for invading
his sovereign state

614
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,300
and that's how he'll save himself.

615
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:17,100
Goddamn runty little bastard!

616
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,700
I want his pecker in my pocket.

617
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:21,700
The thing we have to do,
we have to get him

618
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:24,400
to ask for the troops to say
he wants rights,

619
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:27,300
he wants peace, but he just
can't control his own people.

620
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,100
Make it his failure,
that's what we ought to do.

621
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,300
In an interview today,
Governor Wallace denies

622
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,300
that Alabama State Troopers
and Sheriff's Deputies used

623
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,500
unnecessary force in routing Negro
marchers in Selma.

624
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,500
Call the Speaker.

625
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,900
Tell him I want to address Congress.
On television.

626
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:47,200
That goddamn bill is goin up now.

627
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,700
One more, Governor Wallace.

628
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,300
A little closer.

629
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,500
Thank you.

630
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,900
All right, right here,
let's sit down, Governor.

631
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,900
Over here, that's it.

632
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:01,100
Over there, oooh, right in the corner.

633
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:02,800
The corner, Governor, that's it.

634
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:07,200
All right, Governor,
you wanted to see me?

635
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:08,700
Uh, yes, uh, Mr. President.

636
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,800
I want to thank you
for agreeing to see me...

637
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:13,500
Goddamn demonstrators!
Keepin Lady Bird up,

638
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,200
disturbin my daughters rest.

639
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:16,800
Turn that thing off!

640
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Subversives, most of em.

641
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,200
Communist party's behind
the whole thing.

642
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,500
You know what I'd do,
I'd send some of them

643
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,900
secret service boys out there
with itchin powder.

644
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,700
Sprinkle it on the back of some
of their necks,

645
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,300
they'd drop them signs
they're carryin,

646
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:30,300
scratch themselves raw..

647
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:33,300
That's a great idea.

648
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,200
I'm gonna get my people on that.

649
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,900
Better than that, Governor,
we aughta go out there.

650
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,500
We got all of those
television cameras,

651
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,900
you see this television camera
I got out there?

652
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:42,800
Yes, sir.

653
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,400
Why don't we go out there
and we turn them cameras around

654
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,700
and we'll announce that youm decided

655
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,800
to register every Negro in Alabama?

656
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:52,000
Mr. President, as much as I...

657
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,900
Nick, give me one
of them Constitutions.

658
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,000
Yes, sir.

659
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,500
Nick's got the Constitution.

660
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:01,000
Eh, thank you, Nick. Now, Governor,

661
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,500
I'm sure that somewhere
in here it says

662
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,800
that Negros have the right to vote.

663
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,000
Ah, yes, Mr. President.

664
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:13,200
And uh, they have the right
to vote in Alabama,

665
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,600
but uh, it's the County Registrars,

666
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,100
they uh, they under Alabama law
they independent

667
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:20,400
and I don't have the power.

668
00:35:20,500 --> 00:35:26,600
George... now don't you shit me
about who's got the power in Alabama.

669
00:35:28,100 --> 00:35:28,800
Mr. President.

670
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:32,000
Now, come on, Governor.
You're a persuasive man.

671
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,100
Hell, I was watchin you this mornin
on all three networks.

672
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,800
You were attackin me.

673
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,700
I wasn't attackin you, Mr. President,

674
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,700
I was attackin the idea.

675
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:42,500
Idea, hell, you were attackin me,
George,

676
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,400
and I'll tell ya,
you're so damn persuasive,

677
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,300
I nearly changed my mind.

678
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:51,500
You have marvelous powers
of persuasion, don't you, Governor.

679
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,000
Governor Wallace,

680
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:57,000
you and I shouldn't be sittin here,

681
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:59,600
thinkin about 1965,

682
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,700
we aught to be thinkin about 1995,

683
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,900
when you and I will be long
in our graves.

684
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,500
Now you got a lot of poor people
down there in Alabama,

685
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,000
a lot of ignorant people.

686
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,700
People who need jobs, people
who need a future.

687
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:14,000
You could do a lot for em.

688
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,800
In 1995, Governor,
what do you want left behind?

689
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,400
You want a great big marble monument
sayin George Wallace,

690
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,600
he built, he protected the weak,
the poor,

691
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,400
the impoverished people
of this great state?

692
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:31,900
Or do you want a little piece of
scrawny pine layin there

693
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,400
in the harsh, caliche soil sayin,

694
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:40,800
George Wallace, he hated.

695
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,400
I'm sorry, Governor.
I interrupted you.

696
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:54,800
Now, you wanted to tell me something?

697
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:03,700
Mr. President, I uh,
I've had the opportunity to

698
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:10,800
uh, reevaluate and uh...
I think that uh,

699
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,500
I just may not be able to get things
under control

700
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:18,600
without some uh, assistance.

701
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:23,900
Governor, I'll give you
any assistance that's mine to provide.

702
00:37:24,500 --> 00:37:28,100
Now, what specific measures
would you suggest?

703
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,800
The President and I
have spoken and uh,

704
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:36,100
I have assured him
that I abhor brutality

705
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:39,400
and in my total commitment to law
and order,

706
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:44,200
I will do whatever it takes to uh,
maintain the peace.

707
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:57,900
Mr. Speaker, the President
of the United States.

708
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:46,400
I speak tonight to the dignity of men

709
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:49,200
and the destiny of democracy.

710
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:53,200
There is no Negro problem.

711
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,400
There is no Southern problem.

712
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,700
There is no Northern problem.

713
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,600
There is only an American problem.

714
00:39:10,900 --> 00:39:15,500
There is no cause for pride in
what has happened in Selma.

715
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,400
The cries of pain and the hymns

716
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,000
and protests of oppressed people

717
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,600
have summoned into convocation
all the majesty

718
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,300
of this great government.

719
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,800
Our mission is at once the oldest

720
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:37,700
and the most basic of this country
to right wrong,

721
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:41,900
to do justice, to serve man.

722
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,300
This Wednesday,

723
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,800
I will send you a law

724
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:00,900
which will eliminate illegal barriers

725
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,700
to the most basic American right,

726
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,100
the right to vote.

727
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,800
Many of the issues of civil rights
are very complex,

728
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,500
and most difficult
about this there can

729
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,900
and should be no argument,

730
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,200
for outside this chamber

731
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:23,500
is the outraged conscience
of a nation

732
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:26,300
and the harsh judgment of history.

733
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:29,600
Because of the American Negro,

734
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:34,500
to secure for himself the full
blessings of American life,

735
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:37,500
must be our cause.

736
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:51,800
Because really, it is all of us
who must overcome

737
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,500
the crippling legacy of bigotry
and injustice

738
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,600
and we shall overcome.

739
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:50,400
Dick, ninety three million on TV,
it's a record.

740
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:52,400
Congratulations,
Thanks.

741
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:55,800
Hey, Dick, Dick, the switchboard
is jammed haven't

742
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:57,900
had this many calls since't
he Cuban Missile Crisis.

743
00:41:58,100 --> 00:42:00,300
Hmm, at least we know
they don't only call to complain.

744
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,100
Hey, Dick, sit down, sit down.

745
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:03,600
That was ole Dick Russell.

746
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,800
Says I'm a low-down cur and a turncoat

747
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,600
but he wants me to know
that's the best speech

748
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:11,300
he ever saw any president give
and that goes back to Lincoln!

749
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:13,100
Mr. President, it's Dr. King.

750
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:14,100
Oh, Dr...

751
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:16,600
Oh, Reverend King, that's kind
of you to call.

752
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:19,700
Did you know I was on TV tonight?

753
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,400
Oh, oh, you saw it? Yeah.

754
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,900
Okay, All right. I understand.

755
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:28,400
Yeah. Bye. Bye.

756
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:29,800
You've got Arthur Crimm on Line 3,
sir.

757
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,400
Oh, no-no-no. No, no, I can't.

758
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:32,900
No, no, no.

759
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,900
No.

760
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,000
You know, boys,

761
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:41,000
I'm reminded tonight of Texas
hill country in spring.

762
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,000
Oh, Lyndon,
your guests are far too weary

763
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,600
to appreciate your poetry.

764
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:46,200
Now let me tell you boys

765
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,800
about the hill country
in the spring.

766
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:49,000
Good night.

767
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,100
Good night, all.

768
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,300
Good night, Mrs. Johnson.

769
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:54,400
Good night. Luci.

770
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:55,600
Now, in the spring...

771
00:42:55,700 --> 00:42:59,700
Luci. Come with me. Good night.

772
00:43:00,300 --> 00:43:02,200
Good night, Mrs. Johnson.

773
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:03,800
Good night.

774
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,500
In the spring, in the hill country,

775
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:11,400
the sun is up early

776
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,700
and the ground gets warmer,

777
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:16,800
and you can see the steam risin

778
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,800
and the sap drippin.

779
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:23,200
And in his pen, there's my prize bull.

780
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,000
Now he is the biggest...

781
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:32,600
Best hung bull in the hill country.

782
00:43:33,700 --> 00:43:38,300
Well, in the spring that bull gets
a hankerin for them cows

783
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:42,200
and he starts pawin the ground
and gettin restless.

784
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:45,000
So I open up the pen

785
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:51,400
and he goes down the hill with
his pecker hangin hard and swingin .

786
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:56,100
Well, those cows
get so goddamn excited,

787
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:59,900
they get more and more moist
to receive him

788
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,100
and their asses just start quiverin

789
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,900
they start quiverin all over
every one of em is quiverin !

790
00:44:09,100 --> 00:44:12,200
And as that bull struts
into their pasture,

791
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,700
oooh, boys,
ha-ha we had em quiverin tonight!

792
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,500
Arriving in Naval transports,
United States Marines

793
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:30,900
storm the beaches
in Danang Vietnam in full battle gear.

794
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,400
These are the first U.S.
ground troops to step foot

795
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,700
on Asian soil since the Korean War.

796
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:38,600
They were greeted
by some lovely local ladies.

797
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,300
The Pentagon says their mission
is a defensive one,

798
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:43,300
to protect the U.S. air base
from enemy attack

799
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,900
so Operation Rolling Thunder
can roll on.

800
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,500
Speaking with reporters,

801
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:49,200
President Johnson emphasized

802
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:50,900
that these thirty-five hundred
marines

803
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:53,200
will free up
the South Vietnamese troops

804
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:56,800
now guarding the base to go out
and fight Vietcong.

805
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,500
Reports from the field, however,
indicate that Saigon forces

806
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:02,300
may be no match
for full Vietcong regimen.

807
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,500
Recently, in one of the heaviest
attacks of the war so far,

808
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,500
the Vietcong inflicted
major casualties

809
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:09,500
in Quai Nang Province.

810
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,000
Unofficial sources say
that many South Vietnamese army

811
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,800
units are near collapse.

812
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:16,300
Oh, my, oh, my.

813
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,000
Mr. President.

814
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:21,800
Mr. President.

815
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,700
All right, sit down, sit down boys.

816
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:27,100
I, I heard you fellahs
were talkin over dinner.

817
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,700
Can I get you a plate of food,
Mr. President?

818
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:29,500
No, thank you.

819
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:30,900
Drink?
No.

820
00:45:35,700 --> 00:45:39,100
Why? Why do they want war with us?

821
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,300
To Ho Chi Minh and North Vietnamese

822
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,500
this is just a continuation
of the war with the French,

823
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:45,400
and the Japanese,

824
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:48,500
and the Chinese a thousand years
before that.

825
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,800
We never should have allowed
the French

826
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:52,100
to reclaim their colonies in 45,

827
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,700
but we needed them aligned with us

828
00:45:53,900 --> 00:45:57,100
against the Soviets and that
was their price.

829
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,300
Will we end up like the French?

830
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:03,400
A great power cuttin and runnin from
a bunch a little men in black pajamas,

831
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:05,300
tuckin our tail in defeat?

832
00:46:06,600 --> 00:46:08,400
France didn't have the fire power
we have.

833
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:11,000
But the bombing seems
to have no affect.

834
00:46:11,100 --> 00:46:12,700
Well, it appears now
that it won't stop them,

835
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:15,200
but it has slowed down their resupply.

836
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:17,400
Hanoi's starting
to send down large units

837
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,800
and the more of
their men we can tie up

838
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:20,600
with repairing roads and bridges,

839
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,800
the fewer they can spare
to fight the South.

840
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,800
What do we have there now?

841
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:32,200
Well, we've got the 3rd Marines
at Danang, Phu Bai,

842
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,900
Chu Lai, the 173rd Airborne
at Vung Tau,

843
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,100
for base defense and support
of the South Vietnamese

844
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:38,600
units 13 battalions in all.

845
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,100
Never mind battalions, how many boys?

846
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:44,400
Fifty-one thousand troops,
Mr. President.

847
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,800
Yeah, and Westmorel
and wants how many?

848
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:55,500
One hundred eighty-four thousand.

849
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,300
And the authority to launch
offensive operations

850
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,800
under his own command.

851
00:47:03,900 --> 00:47:06,000
The South Vietnamese are useless,
Mr. President.

852
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,000
They've lost four battalions
in a month.

853
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:09,600
Desertions are at record levels.

854
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,200
They're losing
and they're losing fast.

855
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,400
National Security Advisor
I know they're losin !

856
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,300
I don't need a Phi Beta Kappa key
to know they're losin !

857
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:17,500
Anyone smart enough to pour piss
out of a boot

858
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,100
knows they're losin !

859
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:28,300
How many casualties
you think we'll take?

860
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:34,700
We could reach 500 a month
by the end of the year

861
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,500
if Hanoi hasn't quit by then.

862
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,400
Five hundred a month?

863
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:43,200
You tell Westmorel that
he's got the authority.

864
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,400
Tell him to get out there
and kill Vietcong,

865
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,500
and do whatever he has
to do to hold em off.

866
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,300
Then you and Wheeler go and see him

867
00:47:49,500 --> 00:47:50,600
and nail him down on what he needs

868
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,500
to get this thing over with.

869
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:55,300
Then damn it, let's get it over with!

870
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,500
U.S. Command Center, Saigon

871
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,400
Kid was setting fuses
on the goddamn bridge,

872
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,600
do you believe it?

873
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,200
I was five minutes away.

874
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:07,200
And that potshot last time I was here

875
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,300
he missed me by a mile.

876
00:48:08,500 --> 00:48:12,100
Jesus, you'd think they'd put their
best sniper on the job.

877
00:48:12,200 --> 00:48:13,000
I wish I could tell you

878
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:15,700
they were representative of the enemy
Mr. Secretary.

879
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:23,200
My strategy for the war is divided
into three phases.

880
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,300
In Phase I,

881
00:48:24,500 --> 00:48:27,900
employing the 184,000 man level
now being considered,

882
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,200
we would halt the losing trend
by the end of 1965.

883
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:33,400
In Phase II,

884
00:48:33,500 --> 00:48:37,200
for which an additional
100,000 troops would be needed,

885
00:48:37,300 --> 00:48:42,300
allied forces would gain
the initiative by June 30, 1966,

886
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,600
pacification activities
would be expanded

887
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:47,700
aimed at winning the hearts and minds

888
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:50,900
of the South Vietnamese peasantry.

889
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,200
If the Communists do not then give up

890
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:57,000
Phase III of our strategy would kick
in the win phase,

891
00:48:57,100 --> 00:48:59,800
which would being on July 1, 1966

892
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:04,000
and conclude by December 31, 1967

893
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:08,000
the defeat of remaining
enemy forces and base areas.

894
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:11,400
Additional reinforcements
will be needed for this phase,

895
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:15,100
following which allied forces
will begin to be withdrawn.

896
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:18,200
General, that's a marvelous plan,

897
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:21,300
but uh, excessively abstract.

898
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:22,800
I want to see your numbers.

899
00:49:23,500 --> 00:49:25,900
I want to see the percentage
of the country you now control,

900
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:27,300
The percentage intend to control

901
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,900
with these 200,000 additional men.

902
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:32,700
I want to see rates of infiltration
and interdiction,

903
00:49:32,800 --> 00:49:35,300
force ratios in each
of the tactical corps zones

904
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,700
and enemy casualties
in battles fought

905
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,000
and projected battles
against these added forces.

906
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,800
Mr. Clifford, The President
on Line One.

907
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:05,800
Old friend, I need you here.

908
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,600
Whatever resources are lost through
bombing or capture,

909
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,600
China and Russia will make up
with resupply,

910
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,500
encouraging a friendly game

911
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:21,600
of I'm more revolutionary than though

912
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:23,900
Our intervention
will give them a cause

913
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,100
over which to unite when it is
in our interest to deepen

914
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,300
the breach between them.

915
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,200
Wouldn't we lose credibility
throughout the world

916
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,600
if we give up as you propose?

917
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:32,600
Wouldn t this be an irreparable
blow, George?

918
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:33,700
A worse blow, Mr. President,

919
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,900
would be that the mightiest
power in the world is unable to defeat

920
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,100
one of the most backward.

921
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:39,500
With the seventy-one battalions,

922
00:50:39,700 --> 00:50:41,800
with Westy's plan,
this war is winnable.

923
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,700
I say we go in
and we get the job done.

924
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:45,700
But can we get the job done?

925
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,100
What if they put their stack in?

926
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:49,900
What makes you think
if we put in the numbers

927
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,300
you're suggesting that Ho Chi Minh
won't match us man for man?

928
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,800
This means greater bodies of men,
Mr. President,

929
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:57,700
Which will allow us to cream them.

930
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,600
Their firepower against ours...

931
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:02,100
Why does anyone think
that they will accommodate us

932
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,600
by fighting our kind of war?

933
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:05,000
Their tactics are terror,

934
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:08,000
and sniping they have better
access to intelligence.

935
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,800
Why is this?

936
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,600
It's because the South Vietnamese
government is heavily

937
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,200
infiltrated with Vietcong agents,
Mr. President.

938
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:18,600
What other road can we go,
negotiations,

939
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,900
stopping the bombing?

940
00:51:20,000 --> 00:51:22,200
These make us look weak,
with cup in hand.

941
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:25,000
Better to lose now than
after committing 200,000 men.

942
00:51:25,100 --> 00:51:27,700
I disagree. We have to make
a stand here,

943
00:51:27,900 --> 00:51:29,800
and if we fail it
could be chalked up to

944
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,200
any number of things corruption

945
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:32,700
amongst Saigon's leaders for instance,

946
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:33,900
then we can get out.

947
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:36,100
But this government would have stood
up to the Communists.

948
00:51:36,200 --> 00:51:39,300
But we won't get out,
Bob, we will double our bet

949
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,900
and get massacred in the rice paddies

950
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:44,200
So-so-so-so, what's you're advice,
George? Cut and run?

951
00:51:45,800 --> 00:51:47,100
Mr. President,

952
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,400
no great captain in history
ever hesitated

953
00:51:51,500 --> 00:51:53,700
to make a tactical withdrawal
when conditions were

954
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,200
unfavorable to him.

955
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,900
Does anyone else here agree
with what George is sayin ?

956
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,300
I've asked Clark Clifford to join us.

957
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:12,900
Clark, you have any comments
at this time?

958
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:18,400
I, I have a question
for General Wheeler.

959
00:52:18,500 --> 00:52:19,600
Yes, sir.

960
00:52:19,700 --> 00:52:20,600
Good morning, General.

961
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:21,800
Good morning.

962
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,700
If the President proceeds
with this plan,

963
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:28,500
what in your view would constitute
a victory?

964
00:52:29,300 --> 00:52:32,500
What is the definition of victory
in this contest?

965
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:33,900
Yes.

966
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:36,500
A military victory
in the traditional sense

967
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:38,100
is not what we are seeking.

968
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,200
To eliminate
every last Vietcong guerilla,

969
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:45,300
could require as many
as half a million men

970
00:52:45,500 --> 00:52:46,500
and five years...

971
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:49,900
N-n-no one, no one's considerin
those kinda numbers, no one.

972
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,900
Our objective is to reach
a stalemate whereby

973
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:56,600
we are attriting the enemy faster

974
00:52:56,700 --> 00:52:58,900
than he can replace his loses,

975
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,600
this is the so-called
cross-over point.

976
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:03,300
And how many men will this require?

977
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,600
A substantially smaller number.

978
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:09,700
Depending on how
the North Vietnamese respond.

979
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,700
Well,
might they respond by sending in,

980
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:15,000
say, 100,000 troops?

981
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:16,900
We regard this as unlikely.

982
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:20,300
Well, it's less than half the men
they have under arms.

983
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,400
Well, it's certainly possible,

984
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:23,600
they already have 50,000 men
down there.

985
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,500
And to achieve the ten
to one superiority?

986
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,300
Which I understand is barely adequate

987
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:32,000
for conventional forces
in a guerilla situation.

988
00:53:32,900 --> 00:53:34,400
How many troops would be required

989
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,500
to meet this possible threat?

990
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,900
As I said, this would be unlikely.

991
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,500
One million troops,
is that not correct, General?

992
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:51,500
You see, we would need
one million men in Vietnam.

993
00:53:59,000 --> 00:53:59,700
Excuse me

994
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,900
Clark...

995
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:02,200
I can't tell you how grateful

996
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,500
I am to finely have an alley
at the barricades.

997
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:07,500
Well, it's just what makes sense,
George.

998
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:10,200
Not to Bob McNamara but to me.

999
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,600
A million men was straight-out

1000
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:14,200
of your memo of October last year.

1001
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,000
An impressively persuasive document
in my opinion.

1002
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,500
All sixty-seven pages of it.

1003
00:54:18,600 --> 00:54:19,100
Well...

1004
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,800
I haven't shown much restraint
on the subject, it's true.

1005
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:22,800
If he brought you in,

1006
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:26,300
it must be because I'm like
an old broken record now.

1007
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:28,200
Well, then that'd be two of us.

1008
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,600
Scratchy and irritating as hell.

1009
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:31,900
Good day, George.

1010
00:54:33,600 --> 00:54:34,200
Yeah?

1011
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,700
The Vista Volunteers are here
for the pictures, Mr. President.

1012
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:37,700
All right,
tell em I'll be out in a minute.

1013
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:40,200
And tell Goodwin
I wanna see him right after.

1014
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:45,400
I called Marg soon
as I knew you were safe. Cowards.

1015
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:48,000
I really appreciate that,
she was pretty shaken up.

1016
00:54:48,200 --> 00:54:49,200
She hates my work

1017
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:51,000
Well, I hate sendin ya.

1018
00:54:51,100 --> 00:54:53,100
The whole thing stinks to high heaven

1019
00:54:54,100 --> 00:54:56,100
What'd you wanna tell me in private?

1020
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,400
I've managed to keep
these Vietnam expenditures

1021
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:03,800
under wraps as you requested,

1022
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,800
but if you decide
to move forward with this,

1023
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:09,000
it's going to be impossible to keep up
the guise indefinitely

1024
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,300
and I strongly believe
you should present

1025
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,300
this bill to the American people.
No, absolutely not.

1026
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,200
Mr. President,

1027
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:17,300
I can't continue to hide
these kinds of figures.

1028
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:19,700
Phase I of Westmoreland's
program alone

1029
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:22,800
is going to run us
twelve billion dollars.

1030
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,900
Twelve billion!?

1031
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:28,100
I can't ask Congress
for twelve billion dollars!

1032
00:55:28,300 --> 00:55:29,800
Mr. President.
Bob, it'll be unshirted hell

1033
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,400
if I go to the Hill askin for
that kind of money.

1034
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,600
I'll never get another thing
out of em again.

1035
00:55:34,700 --> 00:55:36,500
Now how much can you trim off that?

1036
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,800
Bob, I've got my ox in a ditch here.

1037
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:42,500
Now, what can you do for me?

1038
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:46,300
If we continue to use
the maximum transfer authority

1039
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,300
from other areas,

1040
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:48,600
I could probably
cut these figures in half,

1041
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:49,900
but we'd still
need a big appropriation

1042
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:51,900
to carry us through this year.

1043
00:55:52,600 --> 00:55:54,800
But Westmoreland says
if we put the men in,

1044
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,600
there's a chance they'll quit
by year's end, right?

1045
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:57,900
Well, that's certainly
what we all hope,

1046
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,000
but we can't count on West...

1047
00:55:59,100 --> 00:56:01,000
You just do the number countin,
will ya, Bob?

1048
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:01,600
Yeah.

1049
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:03,100
Get as low as you can.

1050
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:06,500
One more.

1051
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:12,700
All right. All right, thank you,
thank you.

1052
00:56:15,400 --> 00:56:17,600
Dick,
I need a statement for next week.

1053
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,100
I'm not sure yet
if I'm gonna want to use it,

1054
00:56:19,300 --> 00:56:20,100
but I need it ready.

1055
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,500
All right, Mr. President.

1056
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:23,700
You know, Jack,
I want war like I want polio

1057
00:56:23,900 --> 00:56:27,100
the shootin, the bombin goes against
every bone in my body.

1058
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,500
You know
that better than almost anyone.

1059
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:30,800
These young people here,

1060
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:32,500
that's what I'm all about.

1061
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:33,800
That was me,

1062
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,400
in Cotulla teachin Mexican kids
livin in hovels,

1063
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:39,700
treated worse than you'd treat a dog.

1064
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:42,300
But here I start
a billion dollar bank

1065
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,200
for em in Southeast Asia, free money,

1066
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:46,400
and Ho Chi Minh wants no part of it.

1067
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:49,100
I could a turned that place
into the Tennessee Valley.

1068
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:51,300
I read he said he's willin to fight
for twenty years.

1069
00:56:51,500 --> 00:56:52,700
I know what he says
and I know what I say

1070
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:56,200
and I know what I must do despite
what I say, damn it!

1071
00:56:57,100 --> 00:57:00,200
I want to leave the footprint
of America in Vietnam,

1072
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:03,000
schools, dams, hospitals.

1073
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:05,400
Bomb craters that'll be our footprint

1074
00:57:05,500 --> 00:57:07,200
That's what they'll remember me for.

1075
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:10,000
Not civil rights or health care
or education.

1076
00:57:10,100 --> 00:57:13,400
No, sir,
it'll be Vietnam, Vietnam, Vietnam.

1077
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:16,000
Twenty bills I'm tryin to get out
of committee,

1078
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:18,400
and twelve outta eighteen
workin hours everyday,

1079
00:57:18,500 --> 00:57:22,200
my head's stuck up that raggedy-ass
little fourth-rate country

1080
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:24,600
that doesn't even have the fight
to save itself.

1081
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,800
You get with McNamara,
you know what it's gotta say

1082
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,400
and tell Buzzby or Goodwin

1083
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:34,800
we gotta put the music to it, Jack.

1084
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,400
Why you up?

1085
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,700
You needn't ask me that each time.

1086
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:53,200
Ah, I tried not awake ya.

1087
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
I got the ringer so low
I can't hear it,

1088
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:57,500
and I got the flashlight.

1089
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,400
Maybe you oughta sleep in
that other room you set up.

1090
00:58:01,400 --> 00:58:03,700
What happened to that Prime Rib
from the Medicare meetin ?

1091
00:58:03,800 --> 00:58:04,700
Is that what you want?

1092
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,400
There's a nice chicken left
from the Education Lunch.

1093
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:08,900
I saw em put it away.

1094
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,700
Oh, darlin you been so good
about your diet,

1095
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:14,100
I don't see any point
in the middle of the night...

1096
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:15,600
I don't care about that now!

1097
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:18,600
Another heart attack might
be the answer to my problems.

1098
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:21,200
All right,
you stop that kinda talk please,

1099
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,400
I worry enough about your health.

1100
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,600
I'll fix somethin for you
if you sit down.

1101
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:26,300
All right.
Come on.

1102
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:27,400
All right.

1103
00:58:28,700 --> 00:58:29,800
I'm sorry.

1104
00:58:40,800 --> 00:58:42,200
Luci met a boy.

1105
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,200
When she went on that Chicago trip
with you last week.

1106
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:47,900
What do you mean she met a boy!?

1107
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:50,200
Why didn't I know about this?

1108
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:51,800
That day she went to Milwaukee

1109
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:54,200
and visited the William Feldsteins.

1110
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,000
She visited Beth Jenkins at Marquette

1111
00:58:59,100 --> 00:59:01,000
and Beth had some friends over,

1112
00:59:01,200 --> 00:59:05,500
all the students there
and among them was this...

1113
00:59:05,700 --> 00:59:10,200
boy, Patrick Nugent is his name.

1114
00:59:12,100 --> 00:59:13,500
He's Catholic.

1115
00:59:14,600 --> 00:59:17,900
Luci will only date boys
who are Catholic now

1116
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,100
and she calls him Paddy.

1117
00:59:21,200 --> 00:59:21,700
Thank you.

1118
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,600
So I am payin attention.

1119
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:27,100
He's just tons, mother.

1120
00:59:27,700 --> 00:59:31,300
She said to me.
That's the new expression, tons.

1121
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:32,400
Move your elbow.

1122
00:59:33,100 --> 00:59:33,800
Thank you.

1123
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:36,200
Yeah. You like the chicken?

1124
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:38,300
You remarked on it.

1125
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:42,700
I didn't know of it.

1126
00:59:43,300 --> 00:59:45,200
You might have shown it
to me this mornin .

1127
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,600
And woken you again?

1128
00:59:47,800 --> 00:59:48,900
Oh.

1129
00:59:49,300 --> 00:59:51,500
Like a jack ass in a hailstorm.

1130
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:54,800
I guess I'll just have to hunker up
and take it.

1131
00:59:57,500 --> 01:00:00,000
I feel like I'm goin down in a plane,

1132
01:00:00,900 --> 01:00:05,500
and I can crash with it and burn up,
or jump and die.

1133
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:11,500
Where we were when I came in,
I, I'd trade back to that.

1134
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,500
I'd trade back
to the damn vice-presidency

1135
01:00:16,700 --> 01:00:18,600
to get outta this mess.

1136
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:32,700
Clark, the President would like you
and your wife

1137
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,200
to join him
at Camp David this weekend.

1138
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,100
Oh, thank you, Bill.
Thank the President.

1139
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:38,600
We'd love to,
but we have a prior engagement.

1140
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:40,900
Clark,
is there anyway you can make it?

1141
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,000
He's working on an escalation speech?

1142
01:00:43,100 --> 01:00:44,800
Has he made up his mind?

1143
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,800
I'd say he has
but he's asking for you.

1144
01:00:47,900 --> 01:00:49,800
And who else will be there?

1145
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,200
Bob McNamara.

1146
01:01:16,300 --> 01:01:17,300
Bob.

1147
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,200
Mr. and Mrs. McNamara,

1148
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:23,200
I'd like you to meet my friend,
Pat Nugent.

1149
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:24,600
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

1150
01:01:24,700 --> 01:01:25,600
Pleasure. My wife, Marg.

1151
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,900
Nice to meet you.

1152
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:28,700
You're in National Guard,
where you stationed?

1153
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,600
I'll be at Andrews with the 113th,
sir,

1154
01:01:30,800 --> 01:01:32,800
but down to San Antonio first
for basic.

1155
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,600
Ah, Lackland Air Force Base, sure.

1156
01:01:34,800 --> 01:01:36,800
Used to call it Kelly back in 42
when I was goin

1157
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:39,000
around helpin to build an Air Force
in this country.

1158
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:40,600
You know,
we only had a handful of planes

1159
01:01:40,700 --> 01:01:41,600
when the Japanese attacked us,

1160
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:43,300
spread all over the country.

1161
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,000
Is that right?

1162
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,800
And Hap Arnold knew
every one of em by name.

1163
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
I have some Hap Arnold stories
for you.

1164
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,500
Uh, sorry,
we'll leave everything till tomorrow,

1165
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:54,300
we'll talk in the morning.

1166
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,000
I look forward to it.
Come on in.

1167
01:02:00,500 --> 01:02:02,800
Let the best minds
of our administration

1168
01:02:03,000 --> 01:02:04,800
start looking for a way out

1169
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:08,600
and stop looking for a way to win
this unwinnable war,

1170
01:02:08,700 --> 01:02:11,200
because it is my considered opinion,

1171
01:02:11,600 --> 01:02:13,900
that continuing on that path

1172
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:19,800
will lead us to catastrophe.

1173
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,400
Any unbiased jury would
give you your verdict, Clark,

1174
01:02:23,500 --> 01:02:24,900
no question.

1175
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,200
Good.

1176
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:30,500
But, if it's true what Moyer says;

1177
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,300
that Lyndon's in McNamara's pocket...

1178
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:40,100
McNamara has such sway in there.

1179
01:02:40,900 --> 01:02:44,500
Truman took your advice over
George Marshalls, for heaven sakes

1180
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:46,300
Kennedy, too.

1181
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,000
Yeah,
but Lyndon is another kettle of fish.

1182
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:53,900
Give him a new vision,
Clark. He'll hear you.

1183
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:57,800
Rinaldo, leave it there.

1184
01:03:04,500 --> 01:03:06,900
So, these are the numbers.

1185
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,900
Now, you will not be held accountable

1186
01:03:09,100 --> 01:03:11,100
for anything that has happened up
till this point,

1187
01:03:11,300 --> 01:03:14,700
in fact, you will be admired
for the noble attempt

1188
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,000
you have made
to honor your predecessor's

1189
01:03:16,100 --> 01:03:19,900
commitment a commitment
that has been exploited by

1190
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:23,700
that corrupt and self-destructive
regime in South Vietnam.

1191
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,300
The bombing might have worked,
but it hasn't.

1192
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,700
And to make it work,

1193
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:31,900
you would have to resort
to unconscionable measures

1194
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,300
that would make you a her
to those in this country

1195
01:03:34,400 --> 01:03:38,500
you distain and a criminal
to those you have sought

1196
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:41,000
all your life to assist
the young and the poor,

1197
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:43,800
who are the ones
who will have to fight this war.

1198
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,100
This, this is not the last inning
in the struggle against Communism.

1199
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:50,100
We must pick those spots

1200
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:52,000
where the stakes are highest for us

1201
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,100
and where we hold the cards

1202
01:03:53,300 --> 01:03:56,000
that'll give us the greatest
opportunity to prevail.

1203
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:58,800
Ho Chi Minh told the French,

1204
01:03:58,900 --> 01:04:02,300
he said, You will kill ten of my men

1205
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,700
and I will kill only one of yours,

1206
01:04:04,800 --> 01:04:07,900
but in the end, it is you who'll tire.

1207
01:04:08,100 --> 01:04:09,800
And they did, and eleven years ago,

1208
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:12,500
at the end they just couldn't do it
any more.

1209
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,500
The North Vietnamese lost 500,000
in their war against the French

1210
01:04:16,700 --> 01:04:17,800
and they did not tire,

1211
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,300
and they will not tire now.

1212
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:21,500
Not after you commit a 100,000,

1213
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:23,300
not after you commit 500,000.

1214
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:27,300
And if you do not win decisively
after a big buildup,

1215
01:04:27,500 --> 01:04:29,500
it will be a huge catastrophe.

1216
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:33,300
It will destroy
the American people's faith in you

1217
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:36,000
and the democratic party
and their government

1218
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:37,700
for years to come.

1219
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:40,800
Now, you have always stressed
the economic

1220
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,300
and social dimensions
of world problems.

1221
01:04:43,400 --> 01:04:45,300
And in this you are unrivaled.

1222
01:04:45,400 --> 01:04:47,900
You have a unique opportunity here

1223
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,600
to address this problem,

1224
01:04:49,800 --> 01:04:51,600
economically and socially.

1225
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:54,900
Not by war, not by killing people,

1226
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:58,200
but by helping them here and there.

1227
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:03,500
This is a year of minimum political
risk for you, Mr. President.

1228
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:07,400
You were elected by the largest
landslide in our history,

1229
01:05:07,500 --> 01:05:09,600
the reactionary elements
of this society

1230
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:11,900
will not soon recover

1231
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:16,000
I foresee little erosion
of your prestige and power

1232
01:05:16,200 --> 01:05:19,900
if we cut our loses
and get out of Vietnam.

1233
01:05:20,900 --> 01:05:23,200
But I foresee nothing
but disaster for you

1234
01:05:23,400 --> 01:05:24,600
and this country

1235
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:26,600
if we don't.

1236
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:29,400
If we escalate this war,

1237
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,300
I believe we'll ruin us

1238
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,600
And I believe we'll ruin you

1239
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:39,200
And all the good you've started to do

1240
01:05:48,100 --> 01:05:52,800
Shit. It's a hot one already.

1241
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,900
You wish you were back in Texas,
Mr. President?

1242
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:59,800
Fellahs, right now I'd rather
be on the moon.

1243
01:06:07,000 --> 01:06:08,200
Okay, Bob.

1244
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,100
Mr. President,

1245
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,000
Clark has suggested that
the stakes aren't there in Vietnam.

1246
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:15,200
This is damn shocking.
Well, I...

1247
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:17,600
Here are the stakes:

1248
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,700
Number one. National Security.

1249
01:06:19,900 --> 01:06:21,800
If we back down in Vietnam

1250
01:06:21,900 --> 01:06:23,400
it will only be a matter of time

1251
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,200
before we have to go
in some place else.

1252
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:26,700
Two, the commitment's we've made

1253
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:27,900
and the price of breaking them

1254
01:06:28,000 --> 01:06:31,000
Three,
and Our prestige before the world.

1255
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,500
Could the stakes be any higher?

1256
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:36,500
To elaborate on Point 1.,

1257
01:06:36,600 --> 01:06:40,200
if we withdraw, Laos, Cambodia,
Thailand, Burma will fall,

1258
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,400
but the ripple effect
will be far greater.

1259
01:06:42,500 --> 01:06:45,400
With Communist agitation increasing
in Africa, India,

1260
01:06:45,500 --> 01:06:49,500
even Japan. We will have to give up
some bases.

1261
01:06:49,600 --> 01:06:52,500
Pakistan will move closer to China.

1262
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:54,100
Point two,

1263
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,100
our pledge is a pillar of peace
in the world

1264
01:06:57,200 --> 01:06:58,100
and if we break it,

1265
01:06:58,200 --> 01:07:00,200
our allies will lose faith in us.

1266
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,900
And three,
because we have so persistently

1267
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:06,300
and publicly committed ourselves
to preventing a Communist

1268
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:07,700
takeover in South Vietnam,

1269
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,900
our failure to see that commitment

1270
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:12,400
through will be profoundly
devastating

1271
01:07:12,500 --> 01:07:14,100
to our prestige

1272
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,600
this is why I recommend the following

1273
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,900
1, Put the men in.

1274
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:20,800
Westmoreland's plan is sound,

1275
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:24,900
every quantitative measurement
shows we can win.

1276
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:27,000
2, Call up the reserves
and extend tours of duty

1277
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:28,800
and 3, Expand the bombing.

1278
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:31,300
In the North remove restrictions
on bridge

1279
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,400
and rail lines,

1280
01:07:32,500 --> 01:07:33,600
mine the harbors.

1281
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:34,600
Expand Rolling

1282
01:07:34,700 --> 01:07:36,200
Thunder from twenty-five hundred
to four thousand

1283
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,200
sorties a month. In the South,

1284
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:40,300
tactical air strikes
must be supplemented

1285
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:44,000
by increased B-52 bombing
of VC base areas.

1286
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:45,300
Now, to elaborate...

1287
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:52,800
Clark...

1288
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,700
Clark, I think you scored
some terrific points in there,

1289
01:07:55,900 --> 01:07:58,100
I'm so glad you were arguing
the other side.

1290
01:07:59,000 --> 01:08:00,500
Well...

1291
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,300
you believe what you've said
to the President,

1292
01:08:04,400 --> 01:08:05,900
you're certain we can win?

1293
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:08,100
Well, I sure hope there's no mistake

1294
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,200
in my confidence
on the President's part.

1295
01:08:10,400 --> 01:08:11,700
Well, that's not what I'm asking.

1296
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:13,700
Clark, I've seen the charts,

1297
01:08:13,800 --> 01:08:14,500
I've run the numbers,

1298
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:18,300
everything else is... soft,
speculation.

1299
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:21,800
I had dinner with President Kennedy

1300
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:25,600
just after the Missile Crisis
and he told me

1301
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:27,500
that if it had not been for you,

1302
01:08:27,600 --> 01:08:28,400
keeping your head,

1303
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:29,900
facing down the chief,

1304
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:31,300
thinking clearly,

1305
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
we might not be alive today.

1306
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:36,500
Now, there were no charts
and numbers then.

1307
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:37,900
Just judgment.

1308
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:41,300
You're telling me
that it is your judgment that

1309
01:08:41,800 --> 01:08:44,900
this is the best course of action
for this country?

1310
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:46,700
For this president?

1311
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,600
I can only give my best advice.

1312
01:08:51,700 --> 01:08:53,900
That's what I did for Jack Kennedy,

1313
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:55,600
it's what I'm doing now.

1314
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,300
I'll see you at dinner, Clark.

1315
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,800
You wanna stop somewhere
and talk about it?

1316
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:19,400
I'm all talked out, honey.

1317
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:21,400
I've done nothing but talk.

1318
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,300
At some point the talkin's gotta end.

1319
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,400
God happens when the talkin ends.

1320
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:29,800
Lyndon, oh!

1321
01:09:36,500 --> 01:09:37,600
A hundred PhD's among em,

1322
01:09:37,800 --> 01:09:39,400
ten thousand IQ points

1323
01:09:39,500 --> 01:09:41,100
and I can't get an answer
I can sit with.

1324
01:09:41,900 --> 01:09:43,200
And if it turns bad,

1325
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:45,000
they'll say this wouldn't ve happened
under Jack Kennedy!

1326
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:48,000
No, sir! Cause he could do no wrong!

1327
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:49,000
He leaves a thousand on the beach

1328
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,300
in Cuba and his numbers go up!

1329
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:04,700
Lyndon, now oh...

1330
01:10:08,700 --> 01:10:10,700
Lyndon, now c mon, honey.

1331
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:18,600
What do you think of crashin through

1332
01:10:18,700 --> 01:10:21,400
that damn gate and drivin back
to Texas?

1333
01:10:22,500 --> 01:10:24,800
Now you know you'd get
no argument from me.

1334
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,300
You hate it that much?

1335
01:10:28,700 --> 01:10:31,500
Have you ever considered
the shoes I've had to fill?

1336
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,000
She didn't die with him.

1337
01:10:34,100 --> 01:10:35,500
Oh, he didn't die.

1338
01:10:35,700 --> 01:10:38,600
He's more alive than ever
cause his half-size brother

1339
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:39,700
with one-and-a-half his brains

1340
01:10:39,900 --> 01:10:42,300
and a tenth his scruples
ate his heart out

1341
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:43,800
and took in his spirit

1342
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:46,100
as sure as he was out
of some Injun story.

1343
01:10:46,600 --> 01:10:49,600
And me, I'll be President
What's His Name,

1344
01:10:49,700 --> 01:10:51,200
who came between the two,

1345
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:54,500
the President
who lost America's first war.

1346
01:10:59,700 --> 01:11:03,700
Why must young Americans,
born into a land exultant

1347
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:09,300
with hope and with golden promises
toil and suffer and

1348
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:12,100
sometimes die in such a remote

1349
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:15,200
and distant place as Vietnam?

1350
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:19,000
It is because in the fight
for freedom,

1351
01:11:19,700 --> 01:11:24,600
the American people have learned
that retreat does not bring safety,

1352
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:27,600
and weakness does not bring peace.

1353
01:11:28,700 --> 01:11:31,300
If we are driven from the field
in Vietnam,

1354
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:37,100
then no nation can ever again
have the same confidence

1355
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:39,500
in American promises,

1356
01:11:39,700 --> 01:11:41,700
or in American protection.

1357
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:46,900
We did not choose to be
the guardians of the gate,

1358
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,500
but there is no one else.

1359
01:11:50,500 --> 01:11:53,600
Nor would surrender
in Vietnam bring peace.

1360
01:11:54,200 --> 01:11:56,900
Because we learned from Hitler
at Munch,

1361
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,000
that success only feeds the appetite
of aggression.

1362
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:06,200
I've asked the Commanding General,
General Westmoreland,

1363
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:09,800
what more he needs to meet
this mounting aggression.

1364
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:14,900
He has told me
and we will meet his needs.

1365
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:19,900
I have today ordered
to Vietnam the Airmobile Division

1366
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:22,000
and certain other forces

1367
01:12:22,200 --> 01:12:25,800
which will raise our fighting
strength from 75,000 to

1368
01:12:25,900 --> 01:12:29,800
125,000 men almost immediately.

1369
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:33,400
Additional forces
will be needed later,

1370
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,600
and they will be sent as requested.

1371
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,000
Yeah, but how many?

1372
01:12:39,400 --> 01:12:44,800
Now, I do not find it easy to send
the flower of our youth,

1373
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:49,000
our finest young men into battle.

1374
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:52,100
I think I know how their mothers weep

1375
01:12:52,500 --> 01:12:54,400
and their families sorrows.

1376
01:12:55,100 --> 01:12:58,000
Mr. Secretary, Senator Morse
has been calling Vietnam,

1377
01:12:58,100 --> 01:13:00,800
McNamara's War.
What is your reaction?

1378
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:04,600
This is a war
of the United States Government.

1379
01:13:04,700 --> 01:13:06,700
I am following the President's policy

1380
01:13:06,800 --> 01:13:08,900
and working in close cooperation
with the Secretary of State.

1381
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,700
Now I must say I don't object to

1382
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:12,500
it being called McNamara's War,

1383
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:14,200
I think it's a very important war one

1384
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:16,100
that I'm pleased
to be identified with

1385
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:17,800
and to do what I can to win it.

1386
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,500
Appearing on Meet the Press yesterday

1387
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:22,100
McNamara was asked to comment
on Hanoi's claim

1388
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,000
that some 10,000 civilians
have been killed in the bombing,

1389
01:13:25,200 --> 01:13:27,200
including thousands of women
and children.

1390
01:13:27,300 --> 01:13:30,300
Some loss of innocent life
is unavoidable in an operation

1391
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,600
such as this,

1392
01:13:31,700 --> 01:13:33,200
I can tell you
that we are taking every

1393
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:35,700
possible precaution
in choosing targets,

1394
01:13:35,900 --> 01:13:38,500
the risk of civilian casualties
is most assuredly

1395
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:40,900
one of several factors considered.

1396
01:13:51,900 --> 01:13:53,800
So, what target are you recommending?

1397
01:13:55,100 --> 01:13:57,400
There's a cement factory along
a major rail line.

1398
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,200
General Wheeler feels military value
is marginal.

1399
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:03,700
But the monsoon has sucked
in more valuable targets.

1400
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,400
What's the output of the facility?

1401
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:09,800
It appears to be small, sir,
even by their standards.

1402
01:14:09,900 --> 01:14:10,700
It couldn't produce enough

1403
01:14:10,900 --> 01:14:12,300
for them to rely heavily
on the output.

1404
01:14:12,500 --> 01:14:14,000
Let's give it a C for military value,

1405
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:14,900
what's your risk analysis?

1406
01:14:15,100 --> 01:14:18,100
Risk of pilots is close to zero.

1407
01:14:18,200 --> 01:14:19,700
There might be some small arms fire,

1408
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:23,300
but recon shows
no antiaircraft emplacements.

1409
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:28,400
No megs in the area?

1410
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:31,200
They'll be protecting more valuable
targets and probably

1411
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:32,800
won't risk losing them defending
this one.

1412
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:33,700
Depending on cloud cover,

1413
01:14:33,800 --> 01:14:36,500
we may have to come in low enough
to be in range of small arms

1414
01:14:36,600 --> 01:14:38,100
but this is a small risk.

1415
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:40,200
Give it an A for risk
of pilots and aircraft,

1416
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:41,400
what's your flashpoint analysis?

1417
01:14:41,500 --> 01:14:44,000
The target is more than twenty miles
outside Hanoi so

1418
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:46,900
there's little risk of provoking
China or Russia.

1419
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:49,900
Cosigan or Mau won't be down there

1420
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,100
touring the factory that day,
will they?

1421
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:55,500
This isn't one of Russia
or China's friendship projects?

1422
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:58,200
A gift from the motherland?

1423
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,100
Well, if I were Ho Chi Minh,

1424
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,000
I would have returned this gift.

1425
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,100
Of course, catching one of them

1426
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,000
there might have been a nice bonus
for us.

1427
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:09,100
Thanks, but I've already been
to the brink of nuclear

1428
01:15:09,300 --> 01:15:11,200
annihilation and I'm not eager
to go back.

1429
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:14,800
Give it an A for flashpoint risk.

1430
01:15:14,900 --> 01:15:16,300
Next. What about civilians?

1431
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:17,900
We're clear of residential

1432
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,400
except for one row of hooches
behind the facility.

1433
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:23,300
So what are these, houses
or storage shacks or what?

1434
01:15:23,400 --> 01:15:26,600
Well, we can't be sure uh,
most likely the factory

1435
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,200
managers and their families
live there.

1436
01:15:28,300 --> 01:15:29,200
I'm not too familiar

1437
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,700
with Southeast Asian home
construction, sir.

1438
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:36,300
We could certainly use someone
who knows something

1439
01:15:36,400 --> 01:15:38,300
about Vietnamese culture around here.

1440
01:15:40,800 --> 01:15:43,200
So, what's the outside number
of civilians?

1441
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,100
Well, four hooches this size,
we use six per so,

1442
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:48,300
twentyfour.

1443
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:53,400
Twenty-four for a target this size,
that seems high.

1444
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,000
That's how we figure it, sir.

1445
01:15:55,600 --> 01:15:57,300
I mean that seems a high number
to lose

1446
01:15:57,400 --> 01:15:58,800
for a target like this.

1447
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:00,700
Give it a D for civilian casualties

1448
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,100
let's see what we've got,

1449
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:04,400
C, A, A, D...

1450
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,100
let's give it a solid C+

1451
01:16:06,200 --> 01:16:07,700
and put it before the President.

1452
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:08,900
All right, what's the...

1453
01:16:09,000 --> 01:16:10,000
Jesus, there's a guy on the wall

1454
01:16:10,100 --> 01:16:11,400
at the river entrance!

1455
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:19,800
Look at that guy.

1456
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,400
Hey, wait a minute! Stop!

1457
01:16:23,900 --> 01:16:25,800
Stop! Don't! Don't!

1458
01:16:30,800 --> 01:16:32,300
Get down from there! Get off!

1459
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:36,300
Please, please, the baby, stop! Stop!

1460
01:17:11,400 --> 01:17:12,600
Yes, Mr. President?

1461
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,300
You wanted to see me?

1462
01:17:14,400 --> 01:17:15,400
Yes, sir.

1463
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,000
You could come down now.

1464
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:20,500
Yes, Dick?

1465
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:25,700
Mr. President,
as uh Bill Moyers told you,

1466
01:18:25,800 --> 01:18:27,100
I've been offered a fellowship

1467
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,200
at Wesleyan University in Connecticut

1468
01:18:29,300 --> 01:18:30,600
Well, good for you.

1469
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:32,400
Ha! That ain't easy to get.

1470
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:34,300
No, no, I'm very fortunate.

1471
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,000
Well, don't wait too long
to turn it down

1472
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:38,300
so they can call the next guy
on the list.

1473
01:18:39,900 --> 01:18:42,800
Mr. President,
I have already accepted.

1474
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:45,500
No, problem. You didn't know
you weren't free to go.

1475
01:18:45,600 --> 01:18:48,100
Call em up, put me on if they give
you any trouble.

1476
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:49,800
What do you mean I'm not free to go?

1477
01:18:49,900 --> 01:18:53,300
I mean you can't go.
Can't get along without you.

1478
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,000
That makes you a pretty big fellah.

1479
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:57,700
How big a fellah you gonna be
with some fellowship?

1480
01:18:57,800 --> 01:19:00,200
Well, you've got along
without me before I came.

1481
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:04,700
You want more money?

1482
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:07,300
I got plenty of money.

1483
01:19:07,400 --> 01:19:09,600
I'll arrange a payment
from the Johnson Foundation.

1484
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:11,800
Money isn't the issue, Mr. President.

1485
01:19:11,900 --> 01:19:13,600
This is something that I want to do.

1486
01:19:13,700 --> 01:19:16,500
Well, it ain't gonna be,
so make your call.

1487
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:27,200
Mr. President, I uh, I'm very sorry.

1488
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,700
Well now, Dick...

1489
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:33,500
you either stay here
with me or you go

1490
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,900
over to the Pentagon and get yourself
a pair of shiny

1491
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:38,300
black boots,
because there's a statute,

1492
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:39,300
I asked McNamara,

1493
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:40,900
says we can draft specialists vital

1494
01:19:41,100 --> 01:19:42,200
to the National Interest

1495
01:19:42,300 --> 01:19:43,700
and that's what I'll do.

1496
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,500
You won't to serve here,

1497
01:19:47,200 --> 01:19:48,700
you know where I can send you.

1498
01:19:49,100 --> 01:19:50,100
Will you make me a General?

1499
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:51,500
No, you won't want to be a General.

1500
01:19:51,600 --> 01:19:53,200
You'll want to be
a Private Marine infantry,

1501
01:19:53,300 --> 01:19:54,700
that's where the action is,

1502
01:19:54,900 --> 01:19:56,800
I know you like
to be around the action,

1503
01:19:56,900 --> 01:19:58,400
that's why you stayed here so long.

1504
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:01,600
You listen to me, Dick,

1505
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,600
you go ahead and take your fellowship

1506
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:11,000
but your hands are all over this.

1507
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,600
You and Moyers and Bundy
and everybody else talkin

1508
01:20:13,700 --> 01:20:15,200
about jumpin ship!

1509
01:20:15,800 --> 01:20:17,200
But most of all, you.

1510
01:20:18,400 --> 01:20:20,600
You put your name all over
the Great Society,

1511
01:20:21,100 --> 01:20:23,200
you put the tune
to those words of war, too

1512
01:20:23,300 --> 01:20:24,900
and hidin out on some college campus

1513
01:20:25,000 --> 01:20:26,700
or anything else you ever do

1514
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,600
is never gonna change that!

1515
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:30,000
Dismissed!

1516
01:20:42,700 --> 01:20:46,200
An entire generation
of North Vietnamese have been born

1517
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,600
and lived and died in the pursuit
of one thing

1518
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:52,100
a united Vietnam under Communist rule

1519
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:57,000
The North Vietnamese
have never known anything but war.

1520
01:20:57,800 --> 01:20:59,700
At CIA
we've just completed a study of

1521
01:20:59,900 --> 01:21:02,600
their staggering
recuperative abilities.

1522
01:21:02,700 --> 01:21:03,800
Bridges,

1523
01:21:04,700 --> 01:21:06,700
this one was knocked out
in a morning raid,

1524
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:09,900
two hours later some bamboo planks

1525
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,700
across a bunch of wooden canal boats

1526
01:21:11,900 --> 01:21:13,200
and there's foot traffic again.

1527
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,700
By three p.m.

1528
01:21:15,800 --> 01:21:20,600
it's a pontoon bridge, strong enough
for a fully-loaded truck.

1529
01:21:20,700 --> 01:21:23,100
A bomb knocks out a rail line,

1530
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,300
they call the bicycle brigades.

1531
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:27,600

1532
01:21:27,700 --> 01:21:30,100
some as old as seventy
or seventy-five,

1533
01:21:30,300 --> 01:21:32,300
put the cargo on their bikes,

1534
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,100
each one balances up to a six hundred

1535
01:21:34,200 --> 01:21:36,100
pound load across the frame,

1536
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:37,700
they wheel it across a jerry-rigged

1537
01:21:37,900 --> 01:21:38,600
bridge to another train

1538
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:41,100
waiting to move it on south.

1539
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:44,700
Filling a bomb crater to make
a road passable again,

1540
01:21:45,100 --> 01:21:46,600
that's as routine
to a school kid there

1541
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:49,100
as getting a malt down
at the corner shop here.

1542
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:51,100
It's a first date.

1543
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:54,500
They have a brand of cigarettes,
Mr. President,

1544
01:21:54,600 --> 01:21:58,300
called Dienbienphu
that's their Yorktown,

1545
01:21:58,500 --> 01:22:02,100
their Waterloo where they defeated
the French in 54.

1546
01:22:02,600 --> 01:22:05,500
Reminders of war are
in the most casual

1547
01:22:05,700 --> 01:22:06,900
moments of daily life.

1548
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:11,000
In a smoke, Mr. President,
their heroes,

1549
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,700
he kid who was put to death

1550
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:16,900
for trying to assassinate Secretary
McNamara last year in Saigon,

1551
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:19,100
there's a song about him,

1552
01:22:19,300 --> 01:22:20,600
It's a top ten hit.

1553
01:22:21,300 --> 01:22:23,000
And Norman Morrison.

1554
01:22:24,100 --> 01:22:25,300
Norman Morrison was the Quaker

1555
01:22:25,400 --> 01:22:27,200
who burned himself to death

1556
01:22:27,300 --> 01:22:30,500
in front of the Pentagon last month,

1557
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,300
a great hero.

1558
01:22:33,900 --> 01:22:36,300
Hanoi just issued a postage stamp.

1559
01:22:36,400 --> 01:22:38,000
Thank you, John. Thank you, Scott.

1560
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:40,800
A great hero?

1561
01:22:42,700 --> 01:22:45,700
He almost took his one year
old daughter with him a baby!

1562
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:48,900
It's a miracle she was unharmed.

1563
01:22:50,900 --> 01:22:52,600
The man was disturbed.

1564
01:22:52,700 --> 01:22:54,700
Three young children are fatherless.

1565
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:00,500
Hero.

1566
01:23:03,900 --> 01:23:07,600
So, what do we do?

1567
01:23:08,700 --> 01:23:12,100
Mr. president, the most strategic
targets in North Vietnam

1568
01:23:12,200 --> 01:23:16,000
remain intact because Hanoi
and Haiphong

1569
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,500
continue to be off-limits.

1570
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,200
We're not hitting their oil supply,

1571
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:21,700
major power plants,
rail links to China.

1572
01:23:21,800 --> 01:23:23,900
We're not mining the ports,
hitting the dikes...

1573
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:26,800
CIA says hittin the dikes
would flood the whole damn country!

1574
01:23:26,900 --> 01:23:29,100
Kill the rice crop!
Starve em to death!

1575
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:30,300
Isn't that right?

1576
01:23:31,300 --> 01:23:31,800
Yes, sir.

1577
01:23:31,900 --> 01:23:34,100
And I have one more problem
for your big computer,

1578
01:23:34,300 --> 01:23:37,300
ask how long
it'll take 500,000 angry Americans

1579
01:23:37,400 --> 01:23:40,600
to climb that White House wall
and lynch their President

1580
01:23:40,700 --> 01:23:42,000
he does somethin like that!?

1581
01:23:42,100 --> 01:23:45,200
This is why the Chiefs
and I have been urging for months

1582
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:47,000
that we take the next logical step

1583
01:23:47,100 --> 01:23:48,500
and destroy their oil reserves.

1584
01:23:48,700 --> 01:23:50,700
Nothin stopped em yet,
why should that stop em!?

1585
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:52,700
That oil goes in trucks,
Mr. President,

1586
01:23:52,900 --> 01:23:55,200
trucks that carry troops
and guns and bullets

1587
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:57,000
across the border to kill our men.

1588
01:23:57,100 --> 01:23:59,400
They don't need damn trucks!

1589
01:23:59,500 --> 01:24:00,900
Weren't you watchin !?

1590
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:04,300
They got hundred year old women
auling crap!

1591
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:05,100
What do you want me to do,

1592
01:24:05,300 --> 01:24:07,300
kill everybody's grandmother
in that place!?

1593
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:11,700
Mr. President,
Ambassador Dobrynin says

1594
01:24:11,900 --> 01:24:14,700
that Moscow would try
to bring Hanoi to the table

1595
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:16,700
if we stop the bombing for three
or four weeks.

1596
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:19,500
This would be a grave mistake,
Mr. President.

1597
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:21,700
They'll send down everything they can

1598
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:22,900
Westy's against it,

1599
01:24:23,100 --> 01:24:24,400
Admiral Sharp, Bob,

1600
01:24:24,500 --> 01:24:26,900
I know apposes it and every one
of the Chiefs.

1601
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:30,900
Look, the North Vietnamese
have 9 regiments down there,

1602
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,900
we thought they had 3.

1603
01:24:33,100 --> 01:24:36,500
VC has more than doubled theirs
from 5 to 12,

1604
01:24:36,600 --> 01:24:38,700
which is twice our build up.

1605
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,800
And I just feel that we need
to do something

1606
01:24:42,900 --> 01:24:45,700
before we send another 200,000 men
over there.

1607
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:49,900
Yes, Bob, we can try bombing them
where it hurts.

1608
01:24:50,300 --> 01:24:53,300
The enemy lost over a thousand
in recent fighting,

1609
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:54,000
didn't they?

1610
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,900
They lost 1,200
in the Ia Drang Valley

1611
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:57,900
and we lost 300.

1612
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:00,500
But it's clear they're willing
to take those kinds of casualties,

1613
01:25:00,700 --> 01:25:02,600
which is something
we were not counting on.

1614
01:25:02,700 --> 01:25:04,100
Some where not counting on.

1615
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:09,600
Bob, are you now sayin
that no matter what we do

1616
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,800
militarily there's no sure victory?

1617
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:16,800
I believe we may have been overly
optimistic about an early end.

1618
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:19,300
China, Russia, although they do not
want a general war,

1619
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,200
have stepped up their aid.

1620
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:23,500
Just a moment, gentlemen,

1621
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,600
the President undertook this program

1622
01:25:25,700 --> 01:25:29,700
because General Westmoreland
was confident we could win.

1623
01:25:29,900 --> 01:25:32,300
Why are we considering
/ another 200,000

1624
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:34,600
if you now believe victory
to be unlikely?

1625
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,700
That's my question.

1626
01:25:36,800 --> 01:25:39,900
I still believe we can win.

1627
01:25:41,100 --> 01:25:43,700
But if there is the slightest
chance of obtaining a settlement

1628
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:46,900
without sending over hundreds
of thousands more men,

1629
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,500
and hitting their cities,

1630
01:25:49,700 --> 01:25:51,000
I think we should do it.

1631
01:25:51,700 --> 01:25:53,900
Right now we are incurring
significant casualties,

1632
01:25:54,100 --> 01:25:58,500
if the buildup continues
we may be facing a thousand per month.

1633
01:25:59,900 --> 01:26:02,000
And if Hanoi won't talk,

1634
01:26:02,700 --> 01:26:04,100
it will only make our position

1635
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:05,700
with the American people stronger

1636
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:08,500
and they will be more likely
to accept these kinds of loses.

1637
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,700
We could have a thousand casualties
a month

1638
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:12,300
if we do this, Mr. President!

1639
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:15,000
It's my job to protect our troops,

1640
01:26:15,100 --> 01:26:17,900
every truck,
every sampan that gets through

1641
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:19,700
means more dead Americans,

1642
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,500
they'll send down missiles,
anti-air craft guns,

1643
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:23,500
it'll set us back a year!

1644
01:26:23,700 --> 01:26:24,500
All right, wait a minute now,
all right...

1645
01:26:24,700 --> 01:26:26,600
It seems to me
that if we're this pessimistic,

1646
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:28,400
winning battles,
yet predicting stalemates

1647
01:26:28,500 --> 01:26:29,900
just five months after going in,

1648
01:26:30,100 --> 01:26:31,700
we should pause the bombing
and see what results.

1649
01:26:31,900 --> 01:26:34,400
I'm sorry, George,
but I must disagree.

1650
01:26:34,900 --> 01:26:38,200
If we pause the bombing and it fails,

1651
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:40,300
the President will be under
irresistible pressure

1652
01:26:40,500 --> 01:26:43,100
from the right-wing hawks
in Congress to bomb Hanoi,

1653
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:44,600
to bomb the Red River dikes.

1654
01:26:44,700 --> 01:26:45,500
That'll flood the country

1655
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:49,100
and create a civilian disaster
of such magnitude

1656
01:26:49,700 --> 01:26:52,200
I do not believe
that North Vietnam will talk

1657
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:53,800
until they come to the realization

1658
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:56,200
that this will be a stalemate
that they cannot win

1659
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:57,500
Now they're not there.

1660
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:58,500
They're unrelenting buildup

1661
01:26:58,700 --> 01:27:01,700
in the South clearly indicates
that they believe they can win.

1662
01:27:01,800 --> 01:27:05,300
Are you now sayin
that we have no choice

1663
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,900
but to continue
to match them man for man?

1664
01:27:08,900 --> 01:27:13,300
Well, you made that decision,
Mr. President, we are there,

1665
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:15,100
you have convinced
the American people

1666
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:16,600
that we should be there.

1667
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:18,800
I see no alternative

1668
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:22,100
but for you to make your best effort
to win.

1669
01:27:22,300 --> 01:27:24,100
I couldn't believe my ears!

1670
01:27:24,200 --> 01:27:25,200
Clifford about-facin,

1671
01:27:25,300 --> 01:27:26,700
McNamara goin soft!

1672
01:27:26,900 --> 01:27:28,900
They're all changin their tune now.

1673
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:31,500
And Ole George McBundy got
with the Soviet Ambassador,

1674
01:27:31,600 --> 01:27:32,900
got a little vodka in him,

1675
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:34,900
and those Harvard types that'll
believe anything outta diplomat!

1676
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:39,000
I don't believe for a minute
that Moscow wants peace.

1677
01:27:39,100 --> 01:27:41,600
You don't have to take his advice
if you believe it will fail.

1678
01:27:41,700 --> 01:27:43,200
Didn't you hear anything!

1679
01:27:43,300 --> 01:27:45,300
Don't you know if I don't pause
the bombing now,

1680
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,200
the Kennedys'll all shout
from the mountaintops

1681
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:49,700
that the Russians held out a big fat
olive branch

1682
01:27:49,800 --> 01:27:53,300
and I snapped it in two and now
I've missed my chance for peace!

1683
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:04,100
So how's academic life?

1684
01:28:04,700 --> 01:28:06,200
Not nearly as challenging.

1685
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:10,300
But I can say I've been getting
a lot more sleep.

1686
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,800
Well, someone has to deal
with these things.

1687
01:28:14,500 --> 01:28:16,200
You certainly have the floor space.

1688
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:19,900
That I do. That I do.

1689
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:24,900
You know the guy in that portrait?

1690
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:27,400
James Forrestal.

1691
01:28:27,500 --> 01:28:31,000
That's right.
Truman's Secretary of Defense.

1692
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:34,100
The guy went absolutely nuts.

1693
01:28:35,300 --> 01:28:36,900
When Truman finally got rid of him,

1694
01:28:37,300 --> 01:28:39,000
he pinned him with a service medal,

1695
01:28:39,500 --> 01:28:41,000
he just stood there mute,

1696
01:28:41,500 --> 01:28:45,300
his throat clamped God knows what
demons going through his mind.

1697
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,700
A couple days later he jumped out of
the 16th floor of Bethesda Naval.

1698
01:28:56,700 --> 01:29:00,200
Sometimes, you can wrestle too much.

1699
01:29:01,700 --> 01:29:05,400
Bob, we both came in
with Jack Kennedy.

1700
01:29:05,500 --> 01:29:06,500
We were around when this started.

1701
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:09,000
Vietnam started with Eisenhower
and neither of us were here.

1702
01:29:09,200 --> 01:29:12,400
I know, and it was Kennedy who put
in all those socalled advisors.

1703
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:15,300
But, I can't believe that had
he lived we'd be in this ditch.

1704
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,700
You sound like you've been talking
to Bobby.

1705
01:29:16,900 --> 01:29:18,300
He's your friend,
what's he telling you?

1706
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:25,400
If you told the President to stop
the bombing he'd stop it.

1707
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:28,000
We have stopped the bombing,
under my recommendation.

1708
01:29:28,200 --> 01:29:29,500
You paused it.

1709
01:29:30,200 --> 01:29:31,800
Hanoi knows that you're gonna
start up again

1710
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:33,100
if they don't agree to talk,

1711
01:29:33,200 --> 01:29:36,300
and they have said a hundred times
they won't knuckle under to that.

1712
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:38,800
Now, if you told the President
that you no longer

1713
01:29:39,000 --> 01:29:39,900
believe the bombing can work...

1714
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:41,500
I never said I believed that.

1715
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:44,000
Bobby says you told him it's
not worth a damn.

1716
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:46,000
Well, that's between Bobby and me.

1717
01:29:46,100 --> 01:29:48,500
And as far as my influence
with the President is concerned,

1718
01:29:48,700 --> 01:29:49,800
I think you over-estimate my pull.

1719
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:51,700
I don't see how that's possible.

1720
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:58,100
Peace Talks that's the only way
out of this thing now.

1721
01:30:03,300 --> 01:30:05,000
You stop the bombing for thirty days,

1722
01:30:07,300 --> 01:30:09,400
the brass is ready to hang me,

1723
01:30:09,600 --> 01:30:13,300
God, I sure hope Hanoi wants
to take the bait because...

1724
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:21,000
I just don't think we're going
to be able to beat these people.

1725
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:26,000
So, are you going public
with your views?

1726
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:35,800
I'm thinkin about it.

1727
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,200
Well, you are free to do that now,
aren't you?

1728
01:30:52,700 --> 01:30:54,000
Is that where it happened?

1729
01:30:54,600 --> 01:30:59,300
Yep. It's incredible.

1730
01:31:02,600 --> 01:31:05,100
Absolutely incredible.

1731
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,400
For twenty days now,

1732
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:10,000
we and our South Vietnamese allies

1733
01:31:10,200 --> 01:31:12,800
have dropped no bombs
on North Vietnam.

1734
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:17,500
We seek neither territory, nor bases,

1735
01:31:18,000 --> 01:31:22,400
economic domination
or military alliance in Vietnam.

1736
01:31:23,100 --> 01:31:26,200
We fight for the principle
of self-determination,

1737
01:31:26,300 --> 01:31:28,000
for the people of South Vietnam

1738
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:31,100
to be able to chose their own course,

1739
01:31:31,700 --> 01:31:36,200
chose it in free elections
without violence,

1740
01:31:36,300 --> 01:31:39,600
without terror, and without fear.

1741
01:31:47,200 --> 01:31:51,100
We have said all this
and we have asked

1742
01:31:51,200 --> 01:31:54,800
and hoped and we have waited
for a response.

1743
01:31:56,200 --> 01:31:58,000
None has come.

1744
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:02,400
I believe that we can continue
the Great Society,

1745
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:04,800
while we fight in Vietnam,

1746
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:08,100
yet there are those who cry out,

1747
01:32:08,800 --> 01:32:11,200
We must sacrifice.

1748
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,300
Well, let us rather ask them,

1749
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:15,300
Who will they sacrifice?

1750
01:32:16,100 --> 01:32:18,500
Are they gonna sacrifice the children

1751
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:19,900
who seek their learning,

1752
01:32:20,500 --> 01:32:22,900
or the sick who need medical care,

1753
01:32:23,600 --> 01:32:26,000
or the families that dwell in squalor

1754
01:32:26,100 --> 01:32:28,400
now brightened by the hope of home?

1755
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:33,900
Will they sacrifice opportunity
for the distressed,

1756
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:37,500
the beauty of our land and the hope
of our poor?

1757
01:32:50,500 --> 01:32:53,600
Vietnam has been fighting for
it's independence for 4,000 years.

1758
01:32:53,700 --> 01:32:55,600
We have defeated the Mongols
three times

1759
01:32:55,800 --> 01:32:58,600
and despite all of his bluster
and all his bombs,

1760
01:32:58,700 --> 01:33:02,100
Emperor Johnson is not nearly
as terrifying as Genghis Khan.

1761
01:33:04,900 --> 01:33:07,400
Ho Chi Minh s statement over
Hanoi radio this morning.

1762
01:33:13,000 --> 01:33:14,200
Thirty-seven days.

1763
01:33:15,900 --> 01:33:20,800
Thirty-seven days now,
not one bomb has fallen,

1764
01:33:22,000 --> 01:33:23,500
this is our answer.

1765
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:26,600
This is our answer.

1766
01:33:31,900 --> 01:33:33,200
What now, Bob?

1767
01:33:38,000 --> 01:33:41,200
Hanoi and Haiphong harbor.

1768
01:33:42,000 --> 01:33:45,300
As you can see,
they're in very concentrated areas.

1769
01:33:45,400 --> 01:33:48,200
The tanks and refineries
are within a short distance

1770
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:50,100
of residential sections.

1771
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,900
What about the Russian oil ships?

1772
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,900
They offload with a 250 foot
floating pipeline.

1773
01:33:55,400 --> 01:33:57,800
That's why we're targeting
the distribution tanks,

1774
01:33:58,000 --> 01:34:00,200
some 1500 feet from the vessels.

1775
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:02,800
But still quite close
to the residential areas.

1776
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:03,800
That's correct.

1777
01:34:03,900 --> 01:34:06,800
And I understand that they purposely
situation strategic

1778
01:34:06,900 --> 01:34:08,000
targets close to neighborhoods.

1779
01:34:08,100 --> 01:34:10,000
What about those ships,
can they shoot back?

1780
01:34:10,200 --> 01:34:12,300
No, sir. They're unarmed.

1781
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,700
But the tanks are protected
by surface-to-air missiles.

1782
01:34:15,800 --> 01:34:19,100
The Russians sent them down
during the bombing pause.

1783
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,200
How many planes will we lose?

1784
01:34:21,800 --> 01:34:23,100
Twenty to twenty-five.

1785
01:34:23,200 --> 01:34:24,000
How many casualties?

1786
01:34:24,200 --> 01:34:25,300
Fifty.

1787
01:34:26,300 --> 01:34:29,800
And if the bombs miss,

1788
01:34:29,900 --> 01:34:33,600
it could go as high as 12,000
with 50% of these civilians

1789
01:34:33,800 --> 01:34:35,700
and 50% of those killed.

1790
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:38,900
Of course we don't plan these strikes
to miss our targets.

1791
01:34:41,700 --> 01:34:43,200
But you do miss sometimes.

1792
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:47,000
And this time you could hit
a Russian ship

1793
01:34:47,100 --> 01:34:47,900
and the bomber pilot,

1794
01:34:48,100 --> 01:34:50,200
he'll be a kid from Johnson City,
Texas.

1795
01:34:50,300 --> 01:34:52,800
That'll be the kid
that starts World War III,

1796
01:34:52,900 --> 01:34:54,400
thank you very much.

1797
01:34:55,800 --> 01:34:56,700
All right,

1798
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:01,300
so what great things
will result from this plan?

1799
01:35:01,700 --> 01:35:02,800
With no oil,

1800
01:35:03,000 --> 01:35:05,900
their entire infiltration effort
will grind to a halt,

1801
01:35:06,000 --> 01:35:08,400
from manufacturing to transportation.

1802
01:35:08,500 --> 01:35:11,000
Their war making capability
will be destroyed

1803
01:35:11,200 --> 01:35:13,000
and they will have to negotiate.

1804
01:35:15,700 --> 01:35:16,700
Dean?

1805
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:22,100
The Chinese and the Soviets
will step up aid.

1806
01:35:22,600 --> 01:35:24,400
And we could lose the support
of Canada,

1807
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:28,700
Japan and the Chinese representation
issue at the UN.

1808
01:35:29,800 --> 01:35:33,800
If a Russian ship is sunk,
we just don't know.

1809
01:35:34,800 --> 01:35:37,600
The Chinese may send in troops,

1810
01:35:38,300 --> 01:35:41,500
but as Bus said, this could end it.

1811
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:42,600
What if it doesn't?

1812
01:35:42,700 --> 01:35:46,200
What if by God's grace we don't have
a million Chinese and nuclear war,

1813
01:35:46,300 --> 01:35:47,800
but they still won't quit?

1814
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,000
What will you be askin me
to hit next?

1815
01:35:50,200 --> 01:35:53,200
Strategic targets closer
to the center of Hanoi.

1816
01:35:54,800 --> 01:35:58,500
The Paul Doumer Bridge,
four major rail lines cross it.

1817
01:35:59,200 --> 01:36:01,500
The power plant, industry,

1818
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:03,800
all within five miles of downtown.

1819
01:36:07,900 --> 01:36:10,200
Bob, are you for this?

1820
01:36:13,200 --> 01:36:14,400
It might work.

1821
01:36:15,000 --> 01:36:16,200
So you're for it.

1822
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:18,600
Uh, Mr. President?

1823
01:36:18,700 --> 01:36:19,700
Walt?

1824
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:21,300
Since taking over for Mac Bundy,

1825
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:25,000
I've had a chance to evaluate
our bombing policy and I uh,

1826
01:36:25,200 --> 01:36:26,900
well,
I believe that our continued delay

1827
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:28,800
in attacking Hanoi is causing Russia

1828
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:31,100
and China to underestimate
our resolve

1829
01:36:31,300 --> 01:36:34,900
and that that may actually encourage
World War III.

1830
01:36:37,500 --> 01:36:38,600
Clark?

1831
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:46,000
As always, I support any measure
that has a chance of ending this.

1832
01:36:48,700 --> 01:36:54,700
Anyone else? George? Nothin to add?

1833
01:36:57,400 --> 01:36:59,300
This will not affect
North Vietnamese manpower,

1834
01:36:59,400 --> 01:37:01,300
which has proved to be limitless.

1835
01:37:01,400 --> 01:37:03,900
It will be hard for the Russians
and the Chinese to take,

1836
01:37:04,400 --> 01:37:05,400
I'm concerned as always about

1837
01:37:05,600 --> 01:37:06,800
the escalating level of violence,

1838
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,500
but maybe this will finally satisfy
the hawks in Congress.

1839
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,000
If we have to do it,
let's do it now.

1840
01:37:13,200 --> 01:37:16,800
You know, George, you remind me
of a country schoolteacher,

1841
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:19,700
asked if he believes
the world is flat or round,

1842
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:23,200
he says, I can teach it either way.

1843
01:37:29,200 --> 01:37:30,300
How soon do we go?

1844
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:39,300
This is the same as mine, you know.

1845
01:37:39,400 --> 01:37:42,000
I just as soon forget
about those thirteen days.

1846
01:37:42,200 --> 01:37:44,100
He had them made
at Tiffany's didn't he?

1847
01:37:44,200 --> 01:37:45,300
He gave one to Jackie, too.

1848
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:46,900
She joked it's the only thing
he ever gave her

1849
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:50,000
from there that wasn't ordered
straight out of their catalog.

1850
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:52,900
A trying time.

1851
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:54,600
You speak as if it's in the past.

1852
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,300
What?

1853
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,400
The trying time.

1854
01:38:03,100 --> 01:38:04,000
Here you go.

1855
01:38:15,100 --> 01:38:16,800
...Johnson wasn't much
of a poker player

1856
01:38:16,900 --> 01:38:19,500
but he loved the political
conversation.

1857
01:38:19,600 --> 01:38:21,500
Can a whiskey convert a man, Clark?

1858
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:26,400
Look at them.

1859
01:38:27,000 --> 01:38:28,300
You know what they remind me of?

1860
01:38:29,400 --> 01:38:31,700
A flock of buzzards sittin
on a fence discussing

1861
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:33,000
the price of carrion.

1862
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:34,100
Buzzards.

1863
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:35,400
George.

1864
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:36,500
You could have had Bundy's job.

1865
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:37,500
What was it, Clark?

1866
01:38:37,600 --> 01:38:39,000
You haven't socked away
enough dough yet?

1867
01:38:39,200 --> 01:38:41,200
Oh, no, that's unbecoming of you,
George.

1868
01:38:41,300 --> 01:38:42,900
The basement office? What?

1869
01:38:43,000 --> 01:38:47,000
You know I'd lose my freedom
to advice him on his Presidency

1870
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:48,500
if I took a cabinet post.

1871
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:51,600
George, the President wants
to get out of Vietnam

1872
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:53,800
just as much as you do, in principle.

1873
01:38:54,000 --> 01:38:56,400
Principle?
There's a word that's been tossed

1874
01:38:56,500 --> 01:38:58,600
about more than a dollar whore
in a port of call.

1875
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:00,100
How's this for principle:

1876
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:03,400
what a waste.

1877
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:04,500
You know who said that?

1878
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:05,300
No.

1879
01:39:05,400 --> 01:39:06,400
McNamara.

1880
01:39:06,600 --> 01:39:07,800
To me.

1881
01:39:07,900 --> 01:39:09,000
For all the principle around here

1882
01:39:09,100 --> 01:39:11,100
we're in one hell of a mess,
don't you think?

1883
01:39:13,400 --> 01:39:16,400
Look at him. His wife's got an ulcer,

1884
01:39:16,600 --> 01:39:18,000
his kid's got an ulcer,

1885
01:39:18,100 --> 01:39:21,800
everybody's got Bob McNamara's
ulcer but Bob McNamara.

1886
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:26,300
Sometimes I think it's all just
a god damn academic exercise to him.

1887
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:30,400
George. You mustn't give up on this,
George.

1888
01:39:30,500 --> 01:39:31,900
Oh, Christ, Clark.

1889
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,300
Marny.

1890
01:39:36,600 --> 01:39:39,000
Good evening, Mr. and Mrs.
Clifford how are you.

1891
01:39:39,400 --> 01:39:41,200
I'd like you to meet Charles Rob.

1892
01:39:41,300 --> 01:39:42,300
Clark Clifford.

1893
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:43,900
Anyone who still thinks we ought to
be in Vietnam

1894
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,800
should take a detour from work
and drive by Arlington

1895
01:39:46,000 --> 01:39:47,600
Cemetery every day for a week.

1896
01:39:47,700 --> 01:39:48,600
I don't think I'd trust anyone

1897
01:39:48,700 --> 01:39:50,900
in a policymaking position
who'd do that.

1898
01:39:51,100 --> 01:39:54,600
Who did what, Bob? Who faced
the consequences of his counsel?

1899
01:39:54,800 --> 01:39:57,000
Who needed a reminder of
what war was all about?

1900
01:39:57,100 --> 01:40:00,600
A reminder of what? Our jobs
in World War II, in the rear?

1901
01:40:00,800 --> 01:40:02,400
I pushed paper just like you, Walt.

1902
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:03,900
We were all too damn smart.

1903
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:06,800
I must've been sittin
on my brains then up in that B-25.

1904
01:40:07,000 --> 01:40:08,000
Two years in prison camps.

1905
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,100
That's right, Nick's the only one
here who saw combat.

1906
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:11,900
And you were probably pickin
his targets, Walt.

1907
01:40:12,100 --> 01:40:13,600
As I remember, we won that war.

1908
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:14,700
Yeah, well, you can tell that

1909
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,100
to the 50,000 dead men,
women and children of Dresden.

1910
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:17,900
Dresden...

1911
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,800
Is anyone ready for dinner?

1912
01:40:19,900 --> 01:40:21,700
Dresden was bombed for the rail lines.

1913
01:40:21,800 --> 01:40:23,200
Dresden was bombed to terrorize

1914
01:40:23,300 --> 01:40:24,200
the hell out of those people,

1915
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:26,900
which is precisely what our B-52s
are doing in Vietnam.

1916
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:29,200
And if this keeps up, in another year,

1917
01:40:29,300 --> 01:40:31,100
we'll have dropped more there
than on all of Europe.

1918
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:32,400
Isn't that right, Bob?

1919
01:40:32,500 --> 01:40:33,700
Let's go inside, darling.

1920
01:40:33,800 --> 01:40:36,700
Isn't that what you told me
the other day? In private?

1921
01:40:36,800 --> 01:40:38,400
Among some other things.

1922
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:40,800
Such as the fact that we've destroyed
so much of that country

1923
01:40:40,900 --> 01:40:42,600
they can't even grow enough rice
to feed themselves,

1924
01:40:42,700 --> 01:40:43,900
the rice bowl of the world.

1925
01:40:44,000 --> 01:40:45,000
George.

1926
01:40:45,100 --> 01:40:46,400
We've created so many refugees

1927
01:40:46,500 --> 01:40:48,600
that if we had the same proportion
out of their homes in this country,

1928
01:40:48,700 --> 01:40:51,000
there d be thirty-million people
on the streets.

1929
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:53,200
Isn't that right? Bob?

1930
01:40:53,300 --> 01:40:54,500
Isn't that what you said?

1931
01:40:55,800 --> 01:40:59,400
What was it Tacitus said
about the Romans at Carthage?

1932
01:41:02,000 --> 01:41:04,800
You have made a desert
and call it peace.

1933
01:41:10,700 --> 01:41:12,900
If you still can't reach him then
get whosever on call,

1934
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:14,300
we need a doctor here.

1935
01:41:15,800 --> 01:41:16,800
Christ, Marny.

1936
01:41:17,000 --> 01:41:19,100
I'll be all right. It was the liqueur

1937
01:41:23,000 --> 01:41:23,600
Hello?

1938
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:24,600
Mr. Secretary,

1939
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:26,100
it's Major Wolfson
at the Command Center.

1940
01:41:26,300 --> 01:41:28,500
We just got a call from CINCPAC
saying the weather around

1941
01:41:28,600 --> 01:41:29,900
Hanoi has cleared
and the fighter-bombers

1942
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:31,500
are on their way.

1943
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:38,900
Bob, it's me.

1944
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:42,600
Mr. President, the operations
we discussed will be going tonight.

1945
01:41:42,800 --> 01:41:44,300
They have perfect conditions.

1946
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:50,600
Bob, Bob these, these, these pilots
are said to be the cream.

1947
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:53,900
They're the best the Navy
and Air Force have, Mr. President,

1948
01:41:54,000 --> 01:41:56,100
and they know you're counting on them

1949
01:41:56,700 --> 01:41:58,000
All right, Bob. Thank you.

1950
01:41:58,700 --> 01:41:59,900
I'm going to the Pentagon now,

1951
01:42:00,100 --> 01:42:02,700
I'll call as soon as I have word,
Mr. President.

1952
01:42:02,800 --> 01:42:03,800
Thank you.

1953
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:14,400
Forgive me for ventilating so freely.

1954
01:42:15,200 --> 01:42:16,300
I believe that you are only
so worried

1955
01:42:16,400 --> 01:42:18,700
because you feel foolish
having waited so long

1956
01:42:18,800 --> 01:42:20,000
to take this action.

1957
01:42:20,500 --> 01:42:22,600
If, if you did it a year ago,

1958
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:25,300
instead of using kid gloves
and giving them an extra month

1959
01:42:25,400 --> 01:42:27,100
in which to resupply,

1960
01:42:27,200 --> 01:42:28,800
it would have followed quite naturally

1961
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:31,400
but now it seems to you like one
step too many.

1962
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:33,600
The problem is, my good sir,

1963
01:42:33,700 --> 01:42:36,700
each step has been inches instead
of yards.

1964
01:42:37,200 --> 01:42:40,300
We have been going to war by inches!

1965
01:42:40,400 --> 01:42:44,400
Tip-toeing apologetically
when we should be striding through

1966
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:47,400
with our heads held high
like Americans!

1967
01:42:49,000 --> 01:42:51,300
Why aren't we hearin from em!?

1968
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:00,600
Yes, Bob.

1969
01:43:02,500 --> 01:43:04,400
Mr. President, they had some weather.

1970
01:43:04,900 --> 01:43:06,200
You said it was clear!

1971
01:43:06,300 --> 01:43:08,400
I'll call you the moment
I know anything.

1972
01:43:08,500 --> 01:43:11,400
Bob, my life's in your hands here.

1973
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:13,600
Yes, sir.

1974
01:45:17,100 --> 01:45:18,600
Our Father...

1975
01:45:20,900 --> 01:45:22,800
Our Father...

1976
01:45:25,200 --> 01:45:26,700
Our Father...

1977
01:45:26,800 --> 01:45:28,300
Who art in heaven,

1978
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:31,100
Who art in heaven,

1979
01:45:31,200 --> 01:45:33,200
Hallowed be thy name...

1980
01:45:33,600 --> 01:45:34,800
Hallowed be thy name...

1981
01:45:34,900 --> 01:45:37,900
Well, if you admit her
you could run some tests on her,

1982
01:45:38,000 --> 01:45:40,800
can't you, goddamnit, I mean...
Secretary, Exec-con on one.

1983
01:45:40,900 --> 01:45:44,000
You can see there that she's in
a hell of a lot of pain.

1984
01:45:44,500 --> 01:45:46,000
Thy kingdom come.

1985
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:47,500
Thy kingdom come.

1986
01:45:47,600 --> 01:45:49,300
Thy will be done...

1987
01:45:55,100 --> 01:45:56,300
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1988
01:45:56,500 --> 01:45:58,500
I'm sorry.
On earth.

1989
01:45:58,700 --> 01:45:59,400
On earth.

1990
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:00,200
On earth.

1991
01:46:00,400 --> 01:46:01,700
As it is in heaven.

1992
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:03,100
As it is in heaven.

1993
01:46:06,900 --> 01:46:08,400
Give us this day...

1994
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:10,400
Give us this day...

1995
01:46:11,000 --> 01:46:12,200
Our daily bread...

1996
01:46:12,300 --> 01:46:14,600
Our daily bread...

1997
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:17,100
And forgive us our trespasses.

1998
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:19,700
And forgive us our trespasses.

1999
01:46:19,900 --> 01:46:21,400
As we forgive those
who trespass against us.

2000
01:46:23,500 --> 01:46:27,000
As we forgive those
who trespass against us.

2001
01:46:27,100 --> 01:46:30,100
Lead us not into temptation.

2002
01:46:30,200 --> 01:46:32,200
Lead us not into temptation.

2003
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:36,000
But deliver us from evil.

2004
01:46:38,200 --> 01:46:40,200
Deliver us from evil.

2005
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:42,100
Amen.
Amen.

2006
01:47:27,200 --> 01:47:28,300
Go ahead.

2007
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:30,800
Mr. President,
I just talked with Honolulu,

2008
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:34,900
all the primaries were hit,
and no ships were struck.

2009
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:38,700
Now, we did lose two aircraft
due to anti-air.

2010
01:47:39,100 --> 01:47:42,200
No Russian ships?
We didn't hit any Russian ships?

2011
01:47:42,300 --> 01:47:45,800
No, but as I say, uh,
two pilots are down.

2012
01:47:45,900 --> 01:47:48,700
I won't know about civilian
casualties till we have the photos.

2013
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:51,600
Now, if the weather holds
we could send the RFs in

2014
01:47:51,700 --> 01:47:55,800
to see just what collateral damage...
All right, Bob. Thank you. Thank you.

2015
01:48:00,300 --> 01:48:03,500
Pentagon sources tell CBS news
that General Westmoreland

2016
01:48:03,700 --> 01:48:06,800
has been granted even great
authority over the use of B-52s

2017
01:48:06,900 --> 01:48:09,900
in Vietcong controlled areas
in the South.

2018
01:48:10,000 --> 01:48:13,000
With the recent escalation
of bombing over North Vietnam,

2019
01:48:13,100 --> 01:48:15,400
aimed to destroying the heart
of the enemies

2020
01:48:15,600 --> 01:48:16,900
urban industrial capacity,

2021
01:48:17,100 --> 01:48:18,800
the US clearly wants
to force a change

2022
01:48:19,000 --> 01:48:21,500
in Hanoi's will to continue the war.

2023
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:26,900
Last year the rate of Rolling Thunder
missions reached 1,500 per week,

2024
01:48:27,100 --> 01:48:29,300
since then the rate of sorties
has doubled.

2025
01:48:29,500 --> 01:48:31,100
Mr. President it appears

2026
01:48:31,200 --> 01:48:33,100
that the air strikes have
had no effect

2027
01:48:33,200 --> 01:48:35,300
on the enemy's war making capability.

2028
01:48:36,400 --> 01:48:37,800
The attacks were not successful?

2029
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:40,500
Well, why we did destroy nearly 100%

2030
01:48:40,600 --> 01:48:42,800
of their oil storage capacity

2031
01:48:42,900 --> 01:48:45,600
in our follow-up attacks
throughout the summer,

2032
01:48:46,100 --> 01:48:48,200
a large portion of their stock
was put into barrels and

2033
01:48:48,300 --> 01:48:50,900
dispersed in anticipation of
our strikes.

2034
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,300
They've retained enough to meet
ongoing requirements.

2035
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:54,700
Their buildup is continuing.

2036
01:48:55,300 --> 01:48:57,700
And Westmoreland is requesting
additional men.

2037
01:48:58,700 --> 01:48:59,600
How many?

2038
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:01,900
The Program Three forces
will bring us up

2039
01:49:02,000 --> 01:49:05,000
to 431,000 by the middle of 67.

2040
01:49:06,900 --> 01:49:07,900
What about the bombin ?

2041
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:11,800
We're looking at heavier B-52
strikes in the southern DMZ,

2042
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:15,500
and in North Vietnam--targets
in the restricted zones.

2043
01:49:16,000 --> 01:49:16,900
Downtown Hanoi.

2044
01:49:17,000 --> 01:49:17,400
Yes, sir. And Haiphong.

2045
01:49:17,500 --> 01:49:20,500
And in the buffer zone with China.

2046
01:49:20,700 --> 01:49:23,500
The good news, Mr. President,
is that the naysayers were wrong.

2047
01:49:23,700 --> 01:49:25,400
Peking and Moscow stood still

2048
01:49:25,500 --> 01:49:27,500
and they will very likely stand
still even

2049
01:49:27,700 --> 01:49:29,700
with intensified activity.

2050
01:49:33,400 --> 01:49:35,600
Are you recommendin some of these
new targets for me today?

2051
01:49:35,700 --> 01:49:39,200
Yes, I am. You have the evaluation
sheets before you.

2052
01:49:39,300 --> 01:49:41,800
I have some photographs here,
number seventy-two

2053
01:49:42,000 --> 01:49:43,700
of the Van Dien truck depot.

2054
01:49:44,600 --> 01:49:47,800
That the one with the school
up the street?

2055
01:49:51,700 --> 01:49:55,100
As a matter of fact, yes,
the Polish Friendship School

2056
01:49:55,200 --> 01:49:56,900
across the highway a half a mile up.

2057
01:49:58,000 --> 01:49:59,500
Mr. President, as you may recall,

2058
01:49:59,600 --> 01:50:01,200
in order to avoid a tax increase

2059
01:50:01,300 --> 01:50:04,800
we did not budget for the war
beyond this fiscal year

2060
01:50:04,900 --> 01:50:07,900
which has cost us 20 billion
as apposed

2061
01:50:08,100 --> 01:50:09,800
to the 12 billion projected.

2062
01:50:12,200 --> 01:50:17,700
We're over by eight billion?
Eight billion?

2063
01:50:20,100 --> 01:50:23,900
Mr. President, if you approve
these new forces,

2064
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:26,100
constraints on domestic programs

2065
01:50:26,300 --> 01:50:28,700
will no longer be avoidable.

2066
01:50:29,200 --> 01:50:31,400
It's all in a memo I sent over
to you today along

2067
01:50:31,500 --> 01:50:33,300
with some recommendations.

2068
01:50:41,100 --> 01:50:47,100
Joe, I want to start workin
on the State of the Union.

2069
01:50:49,300 --> 01:50:51,600
You sit down with Bob
and Walt and Fowler.

2070
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:53,000
Yes, Mr. President.

2071
01:50:58,000 --> 01:51:00,100
There's to be no mention
of the Great Society!

2072
01:51:15,100 --> 01:51:18,300
What is it you're lookin for!?
Undersecretary of State?

2073
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:21,300
I'll change the title
to the Holy Roman Emperor, right?

2074
01:51:22,200 --> 01:51:24,200
No, this is the best way

2075
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:26,900
I can serve your Presidency

2076
01:51:27,100 --> 01:51:30,600
and I think Dean Rusk would
feel undercut

2077
01:51:31,100 --> 01:51:33,900
if you were to fill George Ball's job

2078
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,600
with a personal friend of yours.

2079
01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:37,600
I don't give a rat's ass
what Rusk feels,

2080
01:51:37,700 --> 01:51:39,600
I need you in that room, Clark.

2081
01:51:39,700 --> 01:51:42,700
I need someone like George with
an ability to reason and argue.

2082
01:51:42,900 --> 01:51:43,900
A devil's advocate.

2083
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:47,300
George Ball is not playing
devil's advocate.

2084
01:51:47,900 --> 01:51:50,300
He believed every word he said.

2085
01:51:52,800 --> 01:51:55,400
All right. All right.

2086
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,900
Moyers wants the job.

2087
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:04,500
My press man thinks
if I make him number two

2088
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:06,100
at State I'll all of
a sudden give a shit

2089
01:52:06,300 --> 01:52:07,700
what he thinks about Vietnam.

2090
01:52:08,900 --> 01:52:11,700
And McNamara,
McNamara sends me a paper,

2091
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:14,100
says we should cap the troops,
level off the bombin.

2092
01:52:14,200 --> 01:52:15,900
You know what happens
if I stop bombin ?

2093
01:52:16,000 --> 01:52:19,000
Ho Chi Minh runs five
more divisions up my ass,

2094
01:52:19,100 --> 01:52:20,400
that's what happens!

2095
01:52:22,000 --> 01:52:24,100
It was McNamara's program,
the whole thing,

2096
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:26,500
now he's talkin up
a shit storm to Bobby!

2097
01:52:26,700 --> 01:52:27,700
Oh, you don't know that.

2098
01:52:27,900 --> 01:52:29,200
I know everything.

2099
01:52:29,300 --> 01:52:30,500
I know who's sayin

2100
01:52:30,700 --> 01:52:32,500
what at those fancy Georgetown
dinner parties.

2101
01:52:32,600 --> 01:52:35,200
I know cause I had Hoover
put a couple of boys there, too.

2102
01:52:35,300 --> 01:52:35,900
I know.

2103
01:52:36,000 --> 01:52:38,400
What they say doesn't matter.

2104
01:52:38,500 --> 01:52:40,900
You're not helpless in this situation.

2105
01:52:41,100 --> 01:52:43,500
You're approval ratings are down.

2106
01:52:43,600 --> 01:52:47,500
You need to go out there
on the stump and sell the

2107
01:52:47,600 --> 01:52:50,400
truth Westmoreland is now
aying that a Communist

2108
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:54,000
military victory is impossible.

2109
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:56,700
You're finally winning in Vietnam.

2110
01:52:56,800 --> 01:52:58,000
We're winnin but we're losin .

2111
01:52:58,100 --> 01:53:00,100
We're killin em and we're losin .

2112
01:53:00,300 --> 01:53:04,400
We're losin because this war
goes on and on and on.

2113
01:53:04,900 --> 01:53:06,600
I passed twice the number
of bills FDR

2114
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,100
got through in his first hundred days

2115
01:53:08,300 --> 01:53:10,800

2116
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,700
There's never been an era
in American history like this,

2117
01:53:13,800 --> 01:53:16,200
yet there's so much left to do.

2118
01:53:16,800 --> 01:53:19,300
But this war has got to end!

2119
01:53:21,200 --> 01:53:24,700
Five years pussyfootin about
in that miserable little country.

2120
01:53:24,800 --> 01:53:26,800
Two billion dollars a month!

2121
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:27,900
We could be feedin these people,

2122
01:53:28,000 --> 01:53:29,600
educatin these people!

2123
01:53:30,100 --> 01:53:32,000
Goddamnit why won't that sonovabitch

2124
01:53:32,200 --> 01:53:33,900
let me help him? Why!?

2125
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:35,600
Why won't he lay down his arms

2126
01:53:35,700 --> 01:53:38,700
and stop killing off his sons
in the flower of their youth?

2127
01:53:40,800 --> 01:53:45,100
I do not understand.
I... I just do not understand.

2128
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:50,300
Mr. President...

2129
01:53:52,700 --> 01:53:55,400
Moyers, get me Moyers,

2130
01:53:55,500 --> 01:53:57,500
and get me General Westmoreland
on the other line.

2131
01:53:57,700 --> 01:53:59,800
Can I help you, Mr. President?

2132
01:53:59,900 --> 01:54:01,300
Get your bags packed.

2133
01:54:03,400 --> 01:54:07,000
Call the press together.
We're goin to Vietnam.

2134
01:54:19,800 --> 01:54:20,800
Dean?

2135
01:54:25,100 --> 01:54:26,200
Are they ours?

2136
01:54:26,700 --> 01:54:28,100
I fuckin hope so.

2137
01:55:08,600 --> 01:55:11,100
Attention. Arms!

2138
01:55:13,900 --> 01:55:16,500
Order, down!

2139
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:08,000
Where you from, Son?

2140
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:09,300
Louisville, Kentucky, sir.

2141
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:11,000
Kentucky?
Yes, sir.

2142
01:56:11,100 --> 01:56:13,200
Have you turn majority age yet,
Corporal?

2143
01:56:13,300 --> 01:56:14,900
I was twenty-one last month, sir.

2144
01:56:15,000 --> 01:56:17,200
My mom and my girl sent me
a big ol chocolate cake

2145
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:18,900
and it came just in time, sir.
Good.

2146
01:56:19,100 --> 01:56:20,000
Bill, get em out.

2147
01:56:20,100 --> 01:56:20,900
Yes, Mr. President.

2148
01:56:21,100 --> 01:56:22,400
Come on, guys.

2149
01:56:22,500 --> 01:56:24,700
Well, they've given me the honor,
Corporal McCaffrey,

2150
01:56:24,800 --> 01:56:26,800
of pinnin you
with this purple heart here.

2151
01:56:28,700 --> 01:56:30,900
There. You'll be home right soon,

2152
01:56:31,000 --> 01:56:32,200
and on the first Tuesday of November,

2153
01:56:32,300 --> 01:56:35,200
you got a congressional election
I want you to vote.

2154
01:56:36,100 --> 01:56:37,000
Yes, sir.

2155
01:56:37,700 --> 01:56:40,100
Yeah, you'll be able to
get to your pollin place?

2156
01:56:40,600 --> 01:56:43,000
I don't know where it is,
but I'll get a ride, sir.

2157
01:56:43,100 --> 01:56:43,900
All right.

2158
01:56:47,100 --> 01:56:48,300
Make sure you vote now.

2159
01:56:48,500 --> 01:56:49,600
Yes, sir.

2160
01:56:52,300 --> 01:56:55,900
We're all behind you, sir.
Every one of us.

2161
01:56:57,800 --> 01:56:59,200
We won't let you down.

2162
01:57:00,900 --> 01:57:03,500
All right, son. Thank you.

2163
01:57:04,900 --> 01:57:06,400
And I won't let you down!

2164
01:57:07,100 --> 01:57:08,800
You'll get everything you need.

2165
01:57:09,700 --> 01:57:12,600
I thank you, I salute you,

2166
01:57:12,700 --> 01:57:14,400
may the good Lord look over you

2167
01:57:14,500 --> 01:57:16,300
and keep you safe until you come home

2168
01:57:16,400 --> 01:57:18,700
and nail that coonskin to the wall.

2169
01:57:19,300 --> 01:57:20,900
Three cheers for the President!

2170
01:57:21,100 --> 01:57:23,600
Hip-hip-hooray! Hip, hip, hooray!

2171
01:57:23,700 --> 01:57:25,600
Hip, hip, hooray!

2172
01:58:19,300 --> 01:58:21,100
Certainly the bombing of the North

2173
01:58:21,200 --> 01:58:23,600
makes the war more costly
and more difficult

2174
01:58:23,700 --> 01:58:26,300
and more painful for North Vietnam.

2175
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:29,000
It is a harsh punishment indeed.

2176
01:58:29,100 --> 01:58:31,700
But we are not in Vietnam
to play the part

2177
01:58:31,900 --> 01:58:34,600
of an avenging angel pouring death
and destruction.

2178
01:58:35,300 --> 01:58:35,900
We are there
to assure the selfdetermination...

2179
01:58:36,100 --> 01:58:38,500
Kennedy, McCarthy

2180
01:58:38,600 --> 01:58:41,000
they haven't done a thing
for this country!

2181
01:58:41,100 --> 01:58:45,200
Not a fuckin thing!
And look at all I've done.

2182
01:58:45,300 --> 01:58:47,700
It should be clear by now
hat the bombing of the North

2183
01:58:47,900 --> 01:58:50,200
cannot bring an end
to the war in the South,

2184
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:52,200
and that indeed at the present time

2185
01:58:52,300 --> 01:58:54,200
it may well be prolonging that war.

2186
01:58:54,900 --> 01:58:56,600
Our troops are being killed
by the bullets

2187
01:58:56,800 --> 01:58:58,800
and the mines of the South.

2188
01:58:58,900 --> 01:59:00,900
If, by ending the bombing of the North

2189
01:59:01,000 --> 01:59:03,000
we can bring peace to South Vietnam,

2190
01:59:03,200 --> 01:59:05,200
we will save the lives
of thousands of...

2191
01:59:05,300 --> 01:59:07,700
I don't know
why you're worried about Kennedy

2192
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:09,200
and your second term,

2193
01:59:09,900 --> 01:59:11,000
because I don't think your health

2194
01:59:11,200 --> 01:59:12,900
will survive your first term.

2195
01:59:14,500 --> 01:59:15,800
Where you going ?

2196
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:17,600
I want to be useful to you.

2197
01:59:17,700 --> 01:59:19,700
And I would listen even
as you rant and rave,

2198
01:59:19,800 --> 01:59:21,800
but I have worked far too hard
and born

2199
01:59:21,900 --> 01:59:25,300
far too much to watch you
destroy yourself.

2200
01:59:25,400 --> 01:59:36,600
...major political elements
of South Vietnam, anticipate...

2201
01:59:39,900 --> 01:59:42,600
The bridge is a major target
and we've never hit it.

2202
01:59:42,800 --> 01:59:45,000
The chance of civilian deaths
will be almost zero.

2203
01:59:45,100 --> 01:59:47,400
I say one hundred to five hundred,
possibly more.

2204
01:59:47,500 --> 01:59:48,900
Which is it? Five hundred or zero?

2205
01:59:49,100 --> 01:59:51,600
Mr. President, the Stennis Committee
is up in arms over

2206
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:53,500
our holding back on these targets.

2207
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:56,600
Bob's testimony is coming up
and it might take some heat off him

2208
01:59:56,800 --> 01:59:59,000
if some of these can be cleared up
before his appearance.

2209
01:59:59,200 --> 02:00:01,100
I can take the heat without padding
my resume

2210
02:00:01,200 --> 02:00:02,200
with more bombing missions.

2211
02:00:02,300 --> 02:00:03,700
This is a heavily defended target

2212
02:00:03,800 --> 02:00:05,400
in a very populated area.

2213
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:06,900
The photos are right here,
Mr. President.

2214
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:08,400
The photos are meaningless,

2215
02:00:08,500 --> 02:00:10,100
the target is heavily defended.

2216
02:00:10,200 --> 02:00:12,300
The pilots jettison their bombs
when they re under attack.

2217
02:00:12,400 --> 02:00:13,500
Now, I've been asking for two years

2218
02:00:13,700 --> 02:00:15,100
why they don't come straight up
he river

2219
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:16,100
that way they dump the bombs,

2220
02:00:16,200 --> 02:00:17,700
they go in the water and not
on the people

2221
02:00:17,900 --> 02:00:19,100
and I still haven't got an answer!

2222
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:21,900
Coming in from the Gulf involves
an extra turn,

2223
02:00:22,000 --> 02:00:24,200
with our backs to those
heavy defenses.

2224
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:27,900
If it is so well defended,
should we risk the pilots?

2225
02:00:28,000 --> 02:00:30,400
Men dying is a relative thing.

2226
02:00:30,600 --> 02:00:33,100
The effect of the air campaign
is cumulative.

2227
02:00:33,200 --> 02:00:35,900
Every blow makes the enemy stretch
his resources.

2228
02:00:36,000 --> 02:00:38,100
Stretching is a relative thing.

2229
02:00:38,200 --> 02:00:39,700
Mr. President,
we shouldn't be bombing

2230
02:00:39,900 --> 02:00:40,800
for punitive reasons,

2231
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:42,200
but there just doesn't seem
any point to this anymore!

2232
02:00:42,300 --> 02:00:47,300
Hit it. Hit the goddamn bridge.
What's next.

2233
02:00:47,400 --> 02:00:51,600
Uh, number 309, sir,
the uh railcar repair shop...

2234
02:00:55,300 --> 02:00:56,400
Marg?

2235
02:00:59,800 --> 02:01:01,000
Marg!?

2236
02:01:01,800 --> 02:01:06,700
Oh, Jesus! Come to me. Come on.

2237
02:01:06,800 --> 02:01:08,200
I got you. I got you.

2238
02:01:08,300 --> 02:01:10,100
I got you. I got you.

2239
02:01:22,800 --> 02:01:25,200
I don't know what I'm gonna do, Marg.

2240
02:01:27,500 --> 02:01:29,800
Rostow, The Chiefs,
they're gonna drive this thing

2241
02:01:29,900 --> 02:01:31,200
straight to hell.

2242
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:19,800
I won't be long.

2243
02:02:19,900 --> 02:02:20,900
Okay.

2244
02:03:06,100 --> 02:03:09,100
One-two-three-four,
we don't want your fucking war!

2245
02:03:09,200 --> 02:03:12,900
One-two-three-four,
we don't want your fucking war!

2246
02:03:13,000 --> 02:03:16,700
One-two-three-four,
we don't want your fucking war!

2247
02:03:16,800 --> 02:03:20,400
One-two-three-four,
we don't want your fucking war!

2248
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:24,200
One-two-three-four,
we don't want your fucking war!

2249
02:03:24,300 --> 02:03:27,900
One-two-three-four,
we don't want your fucking war!

2250
02:03:28,100 --> 02:03:29,900
One-two-three-four

2251
02:03:30,000 --> 02:03:33,000
Hey-hey-LBJ
How many kids you kill today?

2252
02:03:33,100 --> 02:03:36,500
Hey-hey-LBJ
How many kids you kill today?

2253
02:03:36,700 --> 02:03:40,000
Hey-hey-LBJ
How many kids you kill today?

2254
02:03:40,100 --> 02:03:43,600
Hey-hey-LBJ
How many kids you kill today?

2255
02:03:43,800 --> 02:03:46,800
All right, take formation, spread out

2256
02:03:47,000 --> 02:03:50,300
Stop the war in Vietnam,
bring those troops back home!

2257
02:03:50,500 --> 02:03:55,000
Stop the war in Vietnam,
bring those troops back home!

2258
02:03:55,100 --> 02:03:57,700
Let's go! Let's go! File in,
move it up!

2259
02:03:57,800 --> 02:03:59,200
Hell-no, we won't go!

2260
02:03:59,300 --> 02:04:00,900
Hell-no, we won't go!

2261
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:02,600
Hell-no, we won't go!

2262
02:04:02,800 --> 02:04:04,900
Hell-no, we won't go!

2263
02:04:05,100 --> 02:04:08,100
No rifle is to be loaded
without my permission.

2264
02:04:08,200 --> 02:04:09,700
I'll have the commanders go down
the line again.

2265
02:04:09,900 --> 02:04:12,000
Not one bullet, damn it!

2266
02:04:39,800 --> 02:04:41,400
Get off me! Let me go! Get off me!

2267
02:04:41,500 --> 02:04:44,300
Let me go! Just let me go!

2268
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:49,300
Look, look at that.

2269
02:04:53,000 --> 02:04:57,200
There he is! That's McNamara!
Over there!

2270
02:05:12,800 --> 02:05:15,400
Secretary McNamara,
on behalf of the subcommittee,

2271
02:05:15,500 --> 02:05:18,600
let me thank you
for your appearance here today.

2272
02:05:18,800 --> 02:05:23,500
I have, from the beginning,
and do today,

2273
02:05:23,600 --> 02:05:27,400
fully support the objectives
of the bombing

2274
02:05:28,000 --> 02:05:29,700
to interdict men, and supplies

2275
02:05:29,800 --> 02:05:32,800
and hinder the enemy's ability
to wage war in the South.

2276
02:05:33,700 --> 02:05:37,400
In this I am 100% behind
the Joint Chiefs,

2277
02:05:37,500 --> 02:05:41,500
Admiral Sharp, General Westmoreland,
and his commanders,

2278
02:05:41,700 --> 02:05:45,900
as they are fully aware,
and as the President is aware.

2279
02:05:46,000 --> 02:05:50,200
We are all greatly encouraged
to hear that, Mr. Secretary.

2280
02:05:50,300 --> 02:05:54,000
You are the last to testify,
as you know,

2281
02:05:54,100 --> 02:05:57,200
and the overwhelming view
from General Wheeler and the others

2282
02:05:57,300 --> 02:06:00,800
is that there has been excessive
interference from your office--

2283
02:06:01,000 --> 02:06:03,400
If I'd be permitted to finish
my statement, Senator

2284
02:06:03,600 --> 02:06:05,300
Stennis, there are copies available
outside the hearing room.

2285
02:06:05,400 --> 02:06:11,300
Our greater objective, however,
was, and remains,

2286
02:06:11,400 --> 02:06:13,000
to persuade the leaders
of North Vietnam

2287
02:06:13,200 --> 02:06:15,400
that they cannot prevail.

2288
02:06:15,900 --> 02:06:18,200
In this we have been unsuccessful.

2289
02:06:19,000 --> 02:06:21,200
This is due to the fact
that North Vietnam

2290
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:23,100
can sustain its forces in the South

2291
02:06:23,200 --> 02:06:25,900
with a mere 100 tons
of supplies a day,

2292
02:06:26,000 --> 02:06:29,500
through corrupt elements

2293
02:06:29,600 --> 02:06:31,500
in the South Vietnamese government.

2294
02:06:32,000 --> 02:06:34,800
Out of 359 targets recommended
by the Chiefs,

2295
02:06:35,000 --> 02:06:37,400
only 57 remain unstruck.

2296
02:06:37,500 --> 02:06:42,200
Two are battery plants manufacturing
a total of 600 tons a year,

2297
02:06:42,300 --> 02:06:44,000
not enough to fill the corner
of a Sears,

2298
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:45,500
Roebuck regional warehouse.

2299
02:06:45,700 --> 02:06:46,800
Just a moment, Mr. Secretary!

2300
02:06:46,900 --> 02:06:49,900
There's a rubber plant producing

2301
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:52,100
The service station where
I fill my car

2302
02:06:52,300 --> 02:06:53,900
could supply
the output of this facility.

2303
02:06:54,000 --> 02:06:54,600
Excuse my interruption.

2304
02:06:54,800 --> 02:06:58,800
Hitting these targets will cost us
in pilots, planes,

2305
02:06:58,900 --> 02:07:04,300
and hard cash, and they will kill
more and more civilians.

2306
02:07:04,400 --> 02:07:06,700
The military knows this.

2307
02:07:06,800 --> 02:07:10,200
They think it's worth it. I do not.

2308
02:07:12,300 --> 02:07:13,000
Hold on!

2309
02:07:13,200 --> 02:07:14,600
You know what he did to me out there?

2310
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:17,900
It's like sellin your house
and your son takes the buyer aside

2311
02:07:18,000 --> 02:07:20,100
and tells him there's leaks
in the basement.

2312
02:07:20,700 --> 02:07:23,000
Now Hanoi knows we're divided
and they'll never stop.

2313
02:07:24,100 --> 02:07:26,000
I've gotta get rid of
that sonovabitch.

2314
02:07:26,100 --> 02:07:28,200
You can't just get rid of him.

2315
02:07:28,300 --> 02:07:29,800
The Republicans will play up
the disunity

2316
02:07:30,000 --> 02:07:31,400
and Bobby'll have a field day.

2317
02:07:31,500 --> 02:07:33,500
Bobby's clamorin for him to resign
don't you know,

2318
02:07:33,600 --> 02:07:36,800
to go public against me for doin
what he advised!

2319
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:39,500
Look, we'll find a job for McNamara

2320
02:07:39,600 --> 02:07:41,500
where he won't be able to snipe
at you.

2321
02:07:41,600 --> 02:07:43,800
I'll help you fill his post
with someone you can trust.

2322
02:07:43,900 --> 02:07:46,300
I'll do anything I can for you,
Mr. President.

2323
02:07:46,400 --> 02:07:48,800
But we have a reelection campaign
to start

2324
02:07:48,900 --> 02:07:52,000
and we do not have a policy
to end this war.

2325
02:07:53,900 --> 02:07:57,600
Clark, you'll do anything you can?

2326
02:08:06,500 --> 02:08:07,800
They're ready for you, Mr. President.

2327
02:08:07,900 --> 02:08:10,000
Yep. I'll be out in a minute.

2328
02:08:11,000 --> 02:08:12,000
Sit down, Bob.

2329
02:08:18,100 --> 02:08:20,400
I'm sorry you found out
from the Washington Post.

2330
02:08:20,500 --> 02:08:23,300
I'm sure Fowler told you,
or the bank people.

2331
02:08:24,000 --> 02:08:27,100
Nobody told me anything,
Mr. President. I uh,

2332
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:28,400
mentioned to you in the spring

2333
02:08:28,600 --> 02:08:29,800
that I'd been approached
by the World Bank,

2334
02:08:29,900 --> 02:08:32,800
but I thought
if you were going to nominate me,

2335
02:08:32,900 --> 02:08:34,500
you would have said
something yourself.

2336
02:08:35,100 --> 02:08:37,600
They're doin fine work
there--humanitarian work.

2337
02:08:37,800 --> 02:08:38,900
I know that's of interest to you.

2338
02:08:39,000 --> 02:08:42,000
Yes, but only if it's what you want.

2339
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:44,000
If I can no longer be of service...

2340
02:08:44,200 --> 02:08:48,400
Service? Who's been of more service
to me than you?

2341
02:08:48,600 --> 02:08:51,700
Why you've served longer than any
Defense Secretary in history.

2342
02:08:51,800 --> 02:08:53,600
Look what you've had
to shepherd us through.

2343
02:08:53,700 --> 02:08:57,600
The Cuban crisis, two Cuban crisis,
Berlin, Dominican,

2344
02:08:57,800 --> 02:08:59,400
Middle East. Hell,

2345
02:08:59,600 --> 02:09:01,800
that's a tough enough job
in peace time.

2346
02:09:02,000 --> 02:09:03,800
And look what you've had to deal with

2347
02:09:04,900 --> 02:09:09,100
Mr. President, my point is,

2348
02:09:09,200 --> 02:09:13,200
I don't have to leave
until you want me to leave.

2349
02:09:14,500 --> 02:09:18,200
Bob, Joe Fowler asked me
for three nominees.

2350
02:09:18,300 --> 02:09:20,800
I said I only got one McNamara.

2351
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:23,600
There were tears in
the Treasury Secretary's eyes

2352
02:09:23,700 --> 02:09:25,800
cause he was hopin he'd be my choice.

2353
02:09:25,900 --> 02:09:28,200
And with tears in his eyes
he said he had to

2354
02:09:28,400 --> 02:09:30,000
submit three names to the bank.

2355
02:09:30,200 --> 02:09:34,100
I said, okay, it's McNamara,
McNamara, and McNamara.

2356
02:09:34,200 --> 02:09:35,400
You ask him.

2357
02:09:35,600 --> 02:09:40,000
Now, the bank directors vote today,
but it's uh,

2358
02:09:40,100 --> 02:09:41,600
it's just a formality.

2359
02:09:41,700 --> 02:09:43,300
Now, Bob,

2360
02:09:43,500 --> 02:09:47,200
I better get over to Lady Bird's
beautification awards,

2361
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:48,500
important to her.

2362
02:09:48,600 --> 02:09:51,400
Your wife's the same
with her readin program, I know.

2363
02:09:51,600 --> 02:09:55,200
Yes, although with her condition
it's been difficult.

2364
02:09:55,300 --> 02:09:57,700
Ah, no improvements since surgery?

2365
02:09:58,300 --> 02:10:04,000
My son, uh... he has em as well.

2366
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:08,400
You deserve whatever you want
from this government.

2367
02:10:08,600 --> 02:10:10,200
My obligation is to help you,

2368
02:10:10,800 --> 02:10:13,000
and this was within my power
to grant you.

2369
02:10:16,200 --> 02:10:19,800
People have an obligation
to the President,

2370
02:10:20,400 --> 02:10:22,000
not the other way around.

2371
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:31,900
May your selfless service,
spent in defendin freedom

2372
02:10:32,000 --> 02:10:34,900
bring even greater rewards
in the larger work that you

2373
02:10:35,000 --> 02:10:38,000
now undertake to promote
freedom throughout the world.

2374
02:10:38,200 --> 02:10:40,700
Signed, Lyndon B. Johnson, President.

2375
02:10:46,200 --> 02:10:49,100
This is the Medal of Freedom,

2376
02:10:49,200 --> 02:10:50,500
the highest award a President

2377
02:10:50,700 --> 02:10:54,600
can bestow upon a citizen
of the United States.

2378
02:10:55,200 --> 02:10:59,400
I award it now to a loyal, brilliant,
good man,

2379
02:10:59,600 --> 02:11:02,900
Robert McNamara the very best we have.

2380
02:11:06,700 --> 02:11:08,700
Thank you, Mr. President,
this is an almost impossible

2381
02:11:08,800 --> 02:11:09,600
situation to respond to.

2382
02:11:09,700 --> 02:11:11,600
You're used to impossible situations.

2383
02:11:55,900 --> 02:11:58,200
Now, I stand here tonight to tell you

2384
02:11:58,300 --> 02:12:01,000
that I regard Bob McNamara here,

2385
02:12:01,100 --> 02:12:03,300
as not only one of the smartest,

2386
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:06,100
but one of the most humane men I know.

2387
02:12:12,600 --> 02:12:15,300
One, put the men in.

2388
02:12:18,100 --> 02:12:21,500
Two, call up the reserves,
extend tours of duty.

2389
02:12:23,500 --> 02:12:26,400
And three, expand the bombing.

2390
02:12:38,500 --> 02:12:40,600
Mr. President, uh,

2391
02:12:42,700 --> 02:12:48,700
I cannot uh...
find the words to express

2392
02:12:48,900 --> 02:12:53,600
what lies in my heart today and uh...

2393
02:12:55,300 --> 02:12:57,600
I think I better respond
at another time.

2394
02:13:21,500 --> 02:13:22,400
Mr. Clifford

2395
02:13:23,400 --> 02:13:25,300
Mr. Clifford, does your acceptance
of the job

2396
02:13:25,400 --> 02:13:27,700
of Defense Secretary
signal your interest

2397
02:13:27,800 --> 02:13:29,200
in elected office?

2398
02:13:29,800 --> 02:13:34,300
It signals only my desire to serve
a great President

2399
02:13:34,500 --> 02:13:36,300
and a long-time friend.

2400
02:13:36,400 --> 02:13:41,300
I am 61 years old and I am sure
this will finish me off.

2401
02:13:43,700 --> 02:13:45,500
Quiet please! Quiet please!

2402
02:13:45,700 --> 02:13:46,700
Joe, Joe?

2403
02:13:46,800 --> 02:13:49,100
It's been observed that
in your views on Vietnam,

2404
02:13:49,200 --> 02:13:52,300
you've changed from dove to hawk,
which are you?

2405
02:13:52,400 --> 02:13:55,800
I am not conscious of falling
under any of those

2406
02:13:56,000 --> 02:13:57,600
ornithological divisions.

2407
02:13:57,700 --> 02:13:59,800
I'll tell you this, he's no ostrich.

2408
02:14:01,200 --> 02:14:03,900
I know of no man who will call it
as it is with such candor

2409
02:14:04,100 --> 02:14:06,200
and judgment as this man,
Clark Clifford.

2410
02:14:06,400 --> 02:14:08,600
We got a light at the end
of the tunnel now!

2411
02:14:17,900 --> 02:14:19,300
It's probably a small attack,

2412
02:14:19,400 --> 02:14:21,900
Mr. President the embassy
compound's been hit before.

2413
02:14:22,100 --> 02:14:23,500
Mr. Secretary,
it's not just the embassy,

2414
02:14:23,700 --> 02:14:25,500
the palace, legislature, airport, too

2415
02:14:31,800 --> 02:14:32,600
Secretary Rusk!

2416
02:14:32,700 --> 02:14:34,000
Put it on the speaker phone.

2417
02:14:37,300 --> 02:14:38,300
Go ahead, Ben.

2418
02:14:38,800 --> 02:14:42,300
Dean, I've got the duty officer
at the Embassy, Alan Brandt.

2419
02:14:42,500 --> 02:14:45,200
Mr. Brandt!
Mr. Brandt can you hear me?

2420
02:14:45,300 --> 02:14:47,700
They're shooting right outside,
Mr. Secretary.

2421
02:14:48,200 --> 02:14:49,700
Outside of the Embassy compound?

2422
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:52,300
Inside! They blew through the wall,

2423
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:53,400
they're at the doors.

2424
02:14:53,500 --> 02:14:54,800
Rostow, Casualty report.

2425
02:14:55,000 --> 02:14:57,200
Do you have something to defend
yourself with, Mr. Brandt?

2426
02:14:57,400 --> 02:15:00,300
I'm at the window! They're below me.
They see me.

2427
02:15:00,500 --> 02:15:03,000
They're looking right at me.
I've got to go, Mr. Secretary.

2428
02:15:03,100 --> 02:15:04,800
I've got to go I've got to get out
Small attack!?

2429
02:15:04,900 --> 02:15:06,300
These are desperation moves,

2430
02:15:06,500 --> 02:15:08,600
Mr. President
we've got them on the run!

2431
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,300
It's not just Saigon.

2432
02:15:11,800 --> 02:15:13,500
The Vietcong have launched
surprise attacks

2433
02:15:13,700 --> 02:15:18,000
on 36 of the provincial capitals
of South Vietnam.

2434
02:15:18,100 --> 02:15:20,000
From the streets of Wai near the DMZ,

2435
02:15:20,100 --> 02:15:22,600
to the US Embassy compound in Saigon,

2436
02:15:22,700 --> 02:15:26,600
the casualty count on both sides
has been unprecedented.

2437
02:15:27,100 --> 02:15:29,000
The U.S. Military says
it is successfully

2438
02:15:29,100 --> 02:15:31,100
beating back the Vietcong attacks,

2439
02:15:31,200 --> 02:15:34,300
but clearly they are paying
an enormous price.

2440
02:15:34,500 --> 02:15:36,800
The enemy's well-laid plans
went afoul!

2441
02:15:36,900 --> 02:15:40,100
They tried to ignite a revolution
in the South, and they failed.

2442
02:15:40,300 --> 02:15:43,600
If this is a failure, God help us
when they have a success.

2443
02:16:01,400 --> 02:16:03,800
I've given em all the men,
the planes, the guns,

2444
02:16:03,900 --> 02:16:05,000
the bullets he said he needed,

2445
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:06,900
I thought we were winnin this thing!

2446
02:16:07,000 --> 02:16:10,000
Now Westmoreland says
he wants 206,000 more troops!

2447
02:16:10,200 --> 02:16:11,900

2448
02:16:12,000 --> 02:16:13,900
We'll have 750,000 there.

2449
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:16,800
Three quarters of a million men
in Vietnam.

2450
02:16:16,900 --> 02:16:19,400
Light at the end of the tunnel!
Hell, we don't even have a tunnel!

2451
02:16:19,500 --> 02:16:21,400
We don't even know
where the tunnel is!

2452
02:16:21,500 --> 02:16:22,900
I want you to get Westmoreland here,

2453
02:16:23,000 --> 02:16:25,000
get your people together
and look at this thing.

2454
02:16:25,200 --> 02:16:26,500
We'll give em the boys if we have to,

2455
02:16:26,600 --> 02:16:27,900
but on your recommendation.

2456
02:16:28,100 --> 02:16:29,100
You'll wait?

2457
02:16:29,200 --> 02:16:31,000
I'll wait, but not for long.

2458
02:16:31,100 --> 02:16:33,900
If he needs em what the hell
am I supposed to do!?

2459
02:16:34,900 --> 02:16:38,500
Old friend... get me an answer.

2460
02:16:39,200 --> 02:16:42,000
Give us these troops
and we can seize the initiative!

2461
02:16:42,100 --> 02:16:43,500
But it will just be more of the same!

2462
02:16:43,600 --> 02:16:45,900
The enemy's taken 200,000 killed

2463
02:16:46,100 --> 02:16:47,300
and he'll take 200,000 more!

2464
02:16:47,400 --> 02:16:48,500
We've lost a tenth that many

2465
02:16:48,700 --> 02:16:50,100
and Americans are rioting
in the streets.

2466
02:16:50,300 --> 02:16:52,800
They should be cheering!
They Vietcong lost.

2467
02:16:52,900 --> 02:16:54,200
We were victorious.

2468
02:16:54,400 --> 02:16:54,800
That's true, Walt,

2469
02:16:55,000 --> 02:16:57,100
but remember they only committed

2470
02:16:57,300 --> 02:17:00,000
to this offensive--holding
enough back to strike again.

2471
02:17:00,100 --> 02:17:02,000
That's right, damn it
and it could happen at any time.

2472
02:17:02,100 --> 02:17:03,700
I say put the men in.

2473
02:17:03,900 --> 02:17:05,900
There are no more trained men.

2474
02:17:06,100 --> 02:17:09,000
We would ship raw troops and train
them in the rear.

2475
02:17:09,200 --> 02:17:12,300
What rear? There is no rear
in Vietnam anymore.

2476
02:17:12,400 --> 02:17:15,100
I would hope we've at least learned
that from this victory.

2477
02:17:15,200 --> 02:17:18,500
With 206,000 more men we could go
into Laos, Cambodia,

2478
02:17:18,700 --> 02:17:21,100
North Vietnam and cut out
their supply routes once

2479
02:17:21,200 --> 02:17:24,100
and for all we have never been given
that authority!

2480
02:17:24,800 --> 02:17:28,700
Excuse me, General. Dean,
you said the enemy

2481
02:17:28,900 --> 02:17:32,200
committed 175,000 men
to the offensive.

2482
02:17:32,400 --> 02:17:33,300
That's right, Clark.

2483
02:17:33,500 --> 02:17:35,200
And General Westmoreland says
that they suffered

2484
02:17:35,300 --> 02:17:38,800
to wounded ratio.

2485
02:17:38,900 --> 02:17:40,300
It's right here in my report.

2486
02:17:40,500 --> 02:17:42,700
We beat the pants off them!

2487
02:17:43,300 --> 02:17:46,000
Then how in the hell can we justify
to the public sending

2488
02:17:46,100 --> 02:17:47,900
hundreds of thousands more men!?

2489
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:49,800
We tell them this:

2490
02:17:49,900 --> 02:17:53,500
that we're within inches
of victory inches!

2491
02:17:53,700 --> 02:17:56,000

2492
02:17:56,700 --> 02:17:57,400
Yes, sir.

2493
02:17:57,500 --> 02:18:00,400
And 3.5 times that number
are out of action?

2494
02:18:00,600 --> 02:18:01,500
It's in the report, Clark.

2495
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:05,900
If there's 45,000 dead and three
and a half times that number...

2496
02:18:06,000 --> 02:18:07,600

2497
02:18:07,700 --> 02:18:12,500

2498
02:18:13,100 --> 02:18:17,800
General, according to you
and General Westmoreland

2499
02:18:17,900 --> 02:18:23,100
we have killed and wounded 120%
of the enemy.

2500
02:18:28,600 --> 02:18:31,100
It's becoming more and more evident

2501
02:18:31,200 --> 02:18:33,800
that an out and out military victory

2502
02:18:33,900 --> 02:18:36,500
cannot be achieved with any strategy.

2503
02:18:38,500 --> 02:18:42,800
So... these are my recommendations:

2504
02:18:43,300 --> 02:18:46,100
one, send Westmoreland
only those forces

2505
02:18:46,300 --> 02:18:48,600
that will satisfy his immediate need.

2506
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:51,400
Wheeler has agreed to 22,000 plus

2507
02:18:51,500 --> 02:18:52,800
the units previously approved

2508
02:18:52,900 --> 02:18:55,000
and already scheduled for deployment.

2509
02:18:55,100 --> 02:18:57,400
This would stave off immediate defeat

2510
02:18:57,500 --> 02:18:59,800
while we move to negotiations.

2511
02:19:00,300 --> 02:19:01,900
We realize that the settlemen

2512
02:19:02,000 --> 02:19:03,800
will not be favorable for Saigon

2513
02:19:03,900 --> 02:19:05,100
and they would fight it.

2514
02:19:06,400 --> 02:19:08,900
Two, the bombing,

2515
02:19:09,000 --> 02:19:10,400
Wheeler, the other Chiefs

2516
02:19:10,500 --> 02:19:16,500
and Walt Rostow all advocate hitting
the remaining targets in Hanoi

2517
02:19:16,700 --> 02:19:19,100
and Haiphong and mining and bombing
the harbors.

2518
02:19:19,200 --> 02:19:21,500
With the support of everyone else,

2519
02:19:22,400 --> 02:19:24,100
I recommend a bombing halt.

2520
02:19:24,200 --> 02:19:27,200
I've told you,
I'm not gonna stop the bombin .

2521
02:19:27,300 --> 02:19:28,900
It keeps the lead out of our boys.

2522
02:19:29,100 --> 02:19:30,800
There's little evidence
to support that,

2523
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:34,000
sir and the bombing is going
to be the single greatest issue

2524
02:19:34,200 --> 02:19:36,300
in the Presidential campaign.

2525
02:19:36,700 --> 02:19:39,200
The perception is evolving out

2526
02:19:39,300 --> 02:19:42,200
there that Eugene McCarthy
is the peace candidate and

2527
02:19:42,300 --> 02:19:43,900
you are the war candidate.

2528
02:19:45,500 --> 02:19:48,700
If McCarthy has a good showing
in New Hampshire,

2529
02:19:48,900 --> 02:19:50,300
I think Bobby'll throw his hat in.

2530
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:51,700
But he can't beat you

2531
02:19:51,900 --> 02:19:53,100
if you're sitting at the peace table.

2532
02:19:53,300 --> 02:19:56,100
Peace table! Sell out South Vietnam.

2533
02:19:56,300 --> 02:19:57,800
This is your advice!?

2534
02:19:58,300 --> 02:20:01,300
If I could lay a plan to win
the war before...

2535
02:20:01,500 --> 02:20:02,800
I gotta go on TV in three weeks

2536
02:20:02,900 --> 02:20:04,900
and explain all this
to the American people!

2537
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:07,600
Huh? And you're tellin me to cut
and run admit defeat that

2538
02:20:07,800 --> 02:20:09,800
for nothin !

2539
02:20:09,900 --> 02:20:13,000
That 20,000 American mothers weep
for nothin !

2540
02:20:13,100 --> 02:20:15,000
The situation has changed since Tet.

2541
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:17,200
Yes, it has! Tet was a failure!

2542
02:20:17,300 --> 02:20:18,800
The enemy has failed to overrun us

2543
02:20:18,900 --> 02:20:20,100
and we are poised to win

2544
02:20:20,200 --> 02:20:22,300
and now it's only you and your people

2545
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:24,800
who are advising against
the extra effort

2546
02:20:24,900 --> 02:20:27,800
it'll take to turn three years
of miserable war into victory!

2547
02:20:27,900 --> 02:20:31,100
And I'm telling you there is
no victory to be had!

2548
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:34,000
Not without measures that'll tear
this country apart

2549
02:20:34,100 --> 02:20:35,500
and bring down this administration!

2550
02:20:35,600 --> 02:20:37,800
I told you to get out of
Vietnam three years ago

2551
02:20:37,900 --> 02:20:39,900
Lyndon when you...
What about two years ago, and one!

2552
02:20:40,100 --> 02:20:42,200
Hey? You shot down
every bombing pause,

2553
02:20:42,300 --> 02:20:43,900
backed every troop increase!

2554
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,200
Don't you dare!
Mr. President,

2555
02:20:46,300 --> 02:20:49,000
my counsel has not deviated one whit!

2556
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:54,200
My every word, then as now has been
informed solely by my commitment

2557
02:20:54,300 --> 02:20:56,300
to preserve your Presidency

2558
02:20:56,400 --> 02:20:59,100
and establish your place
in this country's history!

2559
02:20:59,200 --> 02:21:02,800
I shoulda cleaned house November 63,
got rid of all of

2560
02:21:02,900 --> 02:21:05,500
em, McNamara, Bundy, Connally,

2561
02:21:05,700 --> 02:21:10,000
wooin me those fuckin Kennedy lovers
would be disloyal to me!

2562
02:21:10,100 --> 02:21:11,200
All of em!

2563
02:21:19,500 --> 02:21:22,000
They only advised you, Mr. President.

2564
02:21:24,100 --> 02:21:25,500
You decided.

2565
02:21:27,900 --> 02:21:29,800
Against all your natural instincts

2566
02:21:31,200 --> 02:21:37,700
against the whole of
your life experience... you decided.

2567
02:21:43,000 --> 02:21:46,000
Senator Eugene McCarthy,
dove of Vietnam,

2568
02:21:46,100 --> 02:21:47,600
who was virtually unknown to voters

2569
02:21:47,700 --> 02:21:49,400
of this state two months ago,

2570
02:21:49,500 --> 02:21:51,100
has finished in a virtual tie

2571
02:21:51,300 --> 02:21:54,400
with the sitting President of
the United States, Lyndon Johnson.

2572
02:21:55,200 --> 02:21:57,200
Since poles taken only a week ago,

2573
02:21:57,300 --> 02:21:59,100
predicted Johnson would win two-thirds

2574
02:21:59,200 --> 02:22:01,500
of the vote and McCarthy
only eleven percent,

2575
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:03,600
the Senator's surprisingly
high turn-out

2576
02:22:03,700 --> 02:22:05,400
has shocked the country.

2577
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:09,100
I run because
it is now unmistakably clear

2578
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:11,700
that we can change these disastrous,

2579
02:22:11,800 --> 02:22:16,100
divisive policies only
by changing the men

2580
02:22:16,300 --> 02:22:17,700
who are now making them.

2581
02:22:18,400 --> 02:22:21,400
I run because I am convinced
that this country

2582
02:22:21,500 --> 02:22:23,900
is on a perilous course

2583
02:22:24,100 --> 02:22:26,200
and because
I have such strong feelings

2584
02:22:27,100 --> 02:22:29,500
about what must be done

2585
02:22:29,700 --> 02:22:31,900
and I feel that I am obliged

2586
02:22:32,100 --> 02:22:35,300
to do all that I can.
Oh, I was there,

2587
02:22:35,400 --> 02:22:36,600
I was there when you told your brother

2588
02:22:36,700 --> 02:22:38,700
to go into that place. I was there.

2589
02:22:38,800 --> 02:22:40,500
And now I'm payin for it day

2590
02:22:40,700 --> 02:22:44,100
after day after day while you
cut me to pieces!

2591
02:22:44,600 --> 02:22:46,900
There's blood on your hands,
you traitor!

2592
02:22:47,000 --> 02:22:48,900
...prolong that war.
Our troops are being killed

2593
02:22:49,300 --> 02:22:53,000
by the bullets and the mines
of the South.

2594
02:22:53,400 --> 02:22:55,100
If by ending the bombing of the North

2595
02:22:55,300 --> 02:22:57,500
we can bring peace to South Vietnam,

2596
02:22:57,500 --> 02:23:00,900
then we will save the lives
of thousands of our young men,

2597
02:23:01,000 --> 02:23:03,000
and thousands of Vietnamese.

2598
02:23:20,400 --> 02:23:21,500
Yes, Mr. President?

2599
02:23:22,700 --> 02:23:23,900
I talked to Mills.

2600
02:23:25,700 --> 02:23:28,500
He won't back a war surtax unless
we go on TV

2601
02:23:28,600 --> 02:23:29,900
and announce deep cuts.

2602
02:23:30,900 --> 02:23:31,900
I want you to go up there

2603
02:23:32,100 --> 02:23:33,900
and talk to everybody
at Ways and Means.

2604
02:23:34,100 --> 02:23:35,800
I'm meeting with five of them in
the morning, sir.

2605
02:23:35,900 --> 02:23:38,500
Take Ackley up with ya, to back up
the numbers,

2606
02:23:39,000 --> 02:23:41,500
cause they wont believe anything
outta the White House anymore.

2607
02:23:41,700 --> 02:23:43,700
That's a good idea. Anything else,
Mr. President?

2608
02:23:43,800 --> 02:23:44,900
I....

2609
02:23:49,800 --> 02:23:51,600
Are you all right, Mr. President?

2610
02:23:53,800 --> 02:23:56,200
Yeah, Joe, I'm all right.

2611
02:24:01,800 --> 02:24:09,200
Joe...Senator Kennedy's speech
who wrote it for him?

2612
02:24:12,300 --> 02:24:15,300
This guy Walinsky on his staff's
been writing a lot of his stuff.

2613
02:24:15,400 --> 02:24:18,500
I don't know, maybe Schlesinger,
Sorensen.

2614
02:24:19,300 --> 02:24:20,500
Goodwin?

2615
02:24:21,500 --> 02:24:24,100
I think he was involved... yes.

2616
02:24:26,500 --> 02:24:28,000
All right, Joe. Thanks.

2617
02:24:29,200 --> 02:24:30,300
Sir.

2618
02:24:38,000 --> 02:24:40,100
I could never again raise
my voice against

2619
02:24:40,200 --> 02:24:43,100
the violence of the oppressed
in the ghettos

2620
02:24:43,300 --> 02:24:45,100
without having
first spoken clearly to

2621
02:24:45,200 --> 02:24:49,100
the greatest purveyor of violence
in the world today

2622
02:24:49,200 --> 02:24:51,000
my own government.

2623
02:24:58,800 --> 02:25:00,300
Hey-hey-LBJ,
how many kids you kill today?

2624
02:25:00,500 --> 02:25:03,800
Hey-hey-LBJ,
how many kids you kill today?

2625
02:25:03,900 --> 02:25:06,000
Hey-hey-LBJ,
how many kids you kill today?

2626
02:25:06,100 --> 02:25:08,400
The largest antiwar demonstration
yet brought hundreds

2627
02:25:08,500 --> 02:25:11,400
of thousands of protesters into
the streets of American cities.

2628
02:25:11,500 --> 02:25:13,800
The radicals say that
since peaceful demonstrations

2629
02:25:13,900 --> 02:25:14,500
won't end the war,

2630
02:25:14,700 --> 02:25:17,500
they're ready to move
from protest to resistance.

2631
02:25:17,700 --> 02:25:19,600
With talk of full-scale rebellion

2632
02:25:19,800 --> 02:25:22,600
is sweeping the country from college
campus's to the inner cities

2633
02:25:22,700 --> 02:25:24,600
the mood is turning ugly

2634
02:25:24,700 --> 02:25:27,300
and there's a dangerous sense
that the Nation's political

2635
02:25:27,500 --> 02:25:29,100
is spinning out of control.

2636
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:32,100
For it seems now more certain than
ever that the bloody

2637
02:25:32,200 --> 02:25:35,800
experience of Vietnam is to end
in a stalemate.

2638
02:25:35,900 --> 02:25:38,300
This summer's almost certain
stand-off

2639
02:25:38,400 --> 02:25:41,800
will either end in real give
and take negotiations

2640
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:43,900
or terrible escalation.

2641
02:25:44,500 --> 02:25:47,100
But it is increasingly clear
to this reporter,

2642
02:25:47,200 --> 02:25:51,300
that the only rational way out
then will be to negotiate

2643
02:25:51,500 --> 02:25:54,700
not as victors
but as an honorable people

2644
02:25:54,900 --> 02:25:57,800
who lived up to their pledge
to defend democracy

2645
02:25:57,900 --> 02:25:59,900
and did the best they could.

2646
02:26:00,600 --> 02:26:02,700
This is Walter Cronkite, goodnight.

2647
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:11,700
Well, say what you think.

2648
02:27:13,600 --> 02:27:14,800
All right.

2649
02:27:15,800 --> 02:27:18,400
It's tough. And effective.

2650
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:22,700
But the music in it is sad
and sour to the ear.

2651
02:27:24,300 --> 02:27:28,100
And I don't know that any speechwriter
could have made it sing.

2652
02:27:30,200 --> 02:27:32,600
I got a hundred bills in committee

2653
02:27:32,700 --> 02:27:34,600
and they'll never see
the light of day.

2654
02:27:35,200 --> 02:27:37,300
But I think I could
pass a thousand bills

2655
02:27:37,400 --> 02:27:39,000
more education, more health care,

2656
02:27:39,100 --> 02:27:42,400
more rights but it wouldn't matter

2657
02:27:42,500 --> 02:27:45,700
cause it seems nothin I say,
no matter how I say

2658
02:27:45,900 --> 02:27:48,100
it could ever bring
this country together again.

2659
02:27:49,700 --> 02:27:53,200
Then perhaps eloquence of speech

2660
02:27:54,300 --> 02:27:55,800
is no longer the answer...

2661
02:27:55,900 --> 02:27:57,900
but eloquence of action.

2662
02:28:07,400 --> 02:28:08,500
Mr. Secretary...

2663
02:28:08,600 --> 02:28:10,000
Would you be kind enough
to make sure that the

2664
02:28:10,200 --> 02:28:12,000
President sees that this evening?

2665
02:28:12,100 --> 02:28:13,100
Clark?

2666
02:28:13,200 --> 02:28:14,300
Lady Bird

2667
02:28:14,400 --> 02:28:16,400
I promised
to have these budget figures

2668
02:28:16,500 --> 02:28:17,300
by the end of the day.

2669
02:28:17,400 --> 02:28:18,800
Oh, he's right inside.

2670
02:28:19,000 --> 02:28:21,800
No, no, I won't disturb him.

2671
02:28:21,900 --> 02:28:22,900
Thank you, goodnight.

2672
02:28:23,100 --> 02:28:24,400
Clark?

2673
02:28:27,100 --> 02:28:30,900
Uh, Clark. I've got the speech here.

2674
02:28:32,000 --> 02:28:33,400
I need your help with it.

2675
02:28:35,400 --> 02:28:37,900
You know that I'm at your service,
Mr. President.

2676
02:28:38,100 --> 02:28:39,300
I know, old friend.

2677
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:38,900
Good evening, my fellow Americans.

2678
02:29:39,000 --> 02:29:41,800
Tonight,
I want to speak to you of peace

2679
02:29:41,900 --> 02:29:44,900
in Vietnam and Southeast Asia.

2680
02:29:45,400 --> 02:29:48,700
We are prepared to move immediately
towards peace

2681
02:29:48,900 --> 02:29:50,600
through negotiations.

2682
02:29:50,800 --> 02:29:53,600
We are reducing,
substantially reducing

2683
02:29:53,700 --> 02:29:55,800
the present level of hostilities

2684
02:29:55,900 --> 02:29:59,800
and we are doing so unilaterally,
and at once.

2685
02:30:00,900 --> 02:30:04,500
Tonight, I have ordered our aircraft

2686
02:30:04,600 --> 02:30:07,900
and our naval vessels
to make no more attacks

2687
02:30:08,000 --> 02:30:09,800
on North Vietnam

2688
02:30:09,900 --> 02:30:13,700
except in the area north
of the demilitarized zone

2689
02:30:13,800 --> 02:30:17,200
where the continuing
enemy buildup directly threatens

2690
02:30:17,300 --> 02:30:20,000
allied forward positions.

2691
02:30:20,100 --> 02:30:24,000
The area in which we are stopping
our attacks includes

2692
02:30:24,100 --> 02:30:27,600
almost 90%
of North Vietnam's population

2693
02:30:27,800 --> 02:30:29,700
and most of its territory.

2694
02:30:30,500 --> 02:30:32,900
Our purpose in this action is
to bring

2695
02:30:33,000 --> 02:30:38,000
about a reduction in the level
of violence that now exists.

2696
02:30:38,100 --> 02:30:40,900
It is to save the lives of brave men

2697
02:30:41,000 --> 02:30:44,300
and to save the lives of innocent
women and children.

2698
02:30:44,800 --> 02:30:47,200
Now, as in the past,

2699
02:30:47,400 --> 02:30:50,700
the United States is ready to send
its representatives,

2700
02:30:50,800 --> 02:30:54,200
in any forum, any time to discuss

2701
02:30:54,300 --> 02:30:58,200
the means of bringing
this ugly war to an end.

2702
02:31:00,000 --> 02:31:03,900
There is a division
in the American house now.

2703
02:31:04,500 --> 02:31:08,000
There is divisiveness among us
all tonight.

2704
02:31:08,100 --> 02:31:11,000
With America's sons
in the fields far away,

2705
02:31:11,500 --> 02:31:15,400
with America's future under challenge
right here at home...

2706
02:31:15,600 --> 02:31:21,200
with our hopes and the world's hopes
for peace in the balance everyday,

2707
02:31:21,700 --> 02:31:26,600
I do not believe that I should devote
an hour or a day of my time

2708
02:31:26,800 --> 02:31:31,200
to any personal partisan causes
or to any duties

2709
02:31:31,300 --> 02:31:34,300
other than the awesome
duties of this office

2710
02:31:34,800 --> 02:31:37,500
the Presidency of your country.

2711
02:31:39,300 --> 02:31:42,500
Accordingly, I shall not seek,

2712
02:31:43,400 --> 02:31:44,800
and I will not accept,

2713
02:31:44,900 --> 02:31:47,500
the nomination of my party

2714
02:31:47,600 --> 02:31:51,400
for another term as your President.

2715
02:31:56,000 --> 02:31:58,100
But let men everywhere know,

2716
02:31:58,200 --> 02:32:01,600
however, that a strong,
and a confident,

2717
02:32:01,700 --> 02:32:04,900
and a vigilant America
stands ready tonight

2718
02:32:05,100 --> 02:32:07,000
to seek an honorable peace

2719
02:32:07,200 --> 02:32:10,900
and stands ready tonight
to defend an honored cause,

2720
02:32:11,000 --> 02:32:12,800
whatever the price,

2721
02:32:12,900 --> 02:32:14,300
whatever the burden,

2722
02:32:14,400 --> 02:32:18,000
whatever the sacrifice that
that duty may require.

2723
02:32:20,200 --> 02:32:21,500
Thank you for listening.

2724
02:32:22,500 --> 02:32:26,100
Good night and God bless you all.

2725
02:33:21,700 --> 02:33:24,700
President Johnson's speech
and the bombing cutback,

2726
02:33:24,900 --> 02:33:27,100
led to the first peace talks
between the U.S.

2727
02:33:27,200 --> 02:33:29,300
and North Vietnam.

2728
02:33:29,400 --> 02:33:32,000
Negotiations derailed
under President Nixon,

2729
02:33:32,100 --> 02:33:34,100
but a settlement
was eventually signed

2730
02:33:34,200 --> 02:33:36,100
after four more years of war,

2731
02:33:36,200 --> 02:33:38,000
at the end of which more than 58,000

2732
02:33:38,100 --> 02:33:41,700
Americans and two million Vietnamese
were dead.

2733
02:33:42,900 --> 02:33:46,500
President Johnson died
on January 22, 1973, five days

2734
02:33:46,600 --> 02:33:49,400
before the Paris Peace Accords
were signed.

2735
02:33:49,600 --> 02:33:53,500
Many of the programs and initiatives
of the Great Society endure.
