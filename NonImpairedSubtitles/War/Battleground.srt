1
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:37,131
To the rear, march! To the rear, freeze!

2
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:40,867
Forward! To the right flank, freeze!

3
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:43,402
Forward! Platoon, halt.

4
00:02:44,247 --> 00:02:45,612
At ease.

5
00:02:50,987 --> 00:02:53,217
What was that number in Paris?

6
00:03:00,864 --> 00:03:03,765
All heads up. Right face.

7
00:03:04,734 --> 00:03:06,725
Forward march.

8
00:03:32,395 --> 00:03:34,260
Extend. Hut!

9
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:37,332
Swing right. Hut!

10
00:03:53,683 --> 00:03:56,811
"Merry Christmas." That's a crock.

11
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,154
Beats those replacement camps.

12
00:03:59,222 --> 00:04:01,713
You said the war would be over
by Christmas.

13
00:04:01,791 --> 00:04:06,023
What do you want, egg in your beer?
Here we are, two hours from Paris.

14
00:04:08,531 --> 00:04:12,023
The spitting image
of Camp Wolters, Texas.

15
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,861
You know, they got a man in the army.
A two-star general.

16
00:04:15,939 --> 00:04:20,376
But all he does is fly around
in a private plane looking for ugly places.

17
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:24,569
Flat, sandy places. No trees, no water.

18
00:04:25,315 --> 00:04:27,078
Then he checks up on the climate.

19
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,881
If it's too hot in summer for human life
and too cold in winter...

20
00:04:30,954 --> 00:04:34,117
and if it has more rain, fog, wind,
and snow...

21
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:38,991
than any other spot he can find,
then he plants the American flag...

22
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,830
and proclaims it a US Army camp.

23
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:44,796
Did they drill that way at Camp Wolters?

24
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:46,266
Bombshell.

25
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:48,202
Box steps.

26
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:57,505
To the rear, freeze! Forward!

27
00:05:01,918 --> 00:05:04,045
To the right flank, freeze!

28
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,321
Forward! Platoon, halt!

29
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:08,253
At ease!

30
00:05:11,894 --> 00:05:14,226
<i>Forty-two sixty what?</i>

31
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:17,793
<i>- Forty-two sixty-ten.
- Seventy!</i>

32
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:20,700
Platoon, attention. Right face.

33
00:05:21,704 --> 00:05:23,194
Forward march!

34
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:30,608
The Screaming Eagle.

35
00:05:31,647 --> 00:05:34,844
They know who you are
when you wear that on your sleeve.

36
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:37,511
It wasn't bad enough
being in Infantry Replacement.

37
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,885
We have to volunteer
for the 101st Airborne.

38
00:05:39,956 --> 00:05:43,084
You go in gliders instead of trucks.
That's the only difference.

39
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:46,856
There must be a difference
or they wouldn't give you extra pay.

40
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,593
Hooper, I don't think
I'll take in that movie tonight.

41
00:05:50,666 --> 00:05:55,330
I'll be kind of busy getting acquainted
and sewing on shoulder patches.

42
00:05:55,405 --> 00:05:57,805
Why did they have to put us
in different companies?

43
00:05:57,874 --> 00:06:01,640
- Lf we ask them, they might do something.
- No. There's another major general.

44
00:06:01,711 --> 00:06:05,272
His job is to find out who your buddy is
and then to split you up.

45
00:06:05,348 --> 00:06:07,509
- Don't forget, I'm in K Company.
- I won't.

46
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:11,679
And don't you forget, I'm in I Company.
Third platoon, second squad.

47
00:06:11,754 --> 00:06:13,244
So long, Hooper.

48
00:06:15,391 --> 00:06:16,619
Thanks.

49
00:06:56,499 --> 00:06:58,228
Remember that lieutenant in Normandy...

50
00:06:58,301 --> 00:07:02,203
who said he'd court-martial the first man
who tossed his gas mask away?

51
00:07:02,271 --> 00:07:03,704
We ripped out the masks...

52
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:06,799
and used the carriers
for toting that cognac we liberated.

53
00:07:06,876 --> 00:07:10,812
"Take care of that gas mask, soldier.
It might save your life someday."

54
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,747
- Hiya. How did you make out?
- The lights were pretty bad...

55
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:17,274
but I was really flipping them in there.
Six completed passes.

56
00:07:17,353 --> 00:07:21,119
- I'll be hot in that game tomorrow.
- Tomorrow? You ain't going to Paris?

57
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,454
Him? He'd rather play football than eat.

58
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,723
With the chow we've been getting,
I don't blame him. But Paris...

59
00:07:26,796 --> 00:07:29,492
It's gonna be lonesome here.
The whole platoon's going.

60
00:07:29,565 --> 00:07:31,192
All except the replacements.

61
00:07:31,267 --> 00:07:32,825
- Sgt. Wolowicz?
- Yeah?

62
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:35,336
My name is Layton.
I've been assigned to your squad.

63
00:07:35,404 --> 00:07:38,771
Make yourself at home,
but on some other sack.

64
00:07:39,242 --> 00:07:41,972
- That one's mine.
- I'm sorry, I didn't know.

65
00:07:54,157 --> 00:07:57,354
Li'I Abner in Paris.
Boy, that's gonna be something.

66
00:07:57,593 --> 00:08:00,528
Daisy Mae won't know you
when you get back to Dogpatch.

67
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:03,588
That's for dang sure.

68
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,928
Abner, will you please stop saying that?

69
00:08:07,003 --> 00:08:09,233
Fellows, look what I found.

70
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,674
- Holley.
- The Purple Heart kid.

71
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:14,505
At ease, men.

72
00:08:15,111 --> 00:08:18,205
I heard the war was on its last legs,
so I thought I'd come back.

73
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:21,216
Rough in the ETO.
A little scratch on his leg...

74
00:08:21,284 --> 00:08:24,981
and a month later he comes back in time
for a three-day pass to Paris.

75
00:08:25,054 --> 00:08:27,079
It was misery in that hospital, Kipp.

76
00:08:27,156 --> 00:08:30,216
<i>Passes every night, champagne, I'amour.</i>

77
00:08:31,827 --> 00:08:34,990
And me brooding all the time
about my dear buddies back there...

78
00:08:35,064 --> 00:08:37,032
defending the Republic.

79
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,465
Will you look at that girl bait.

80
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:44,735
I'm getting me a mess of that fruit salad
just as soon as we hit Paris.

81
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:49,375
You can have the sack next to me.
Nobody's got it, have they?

82
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:52,374
No, I was just sitting here.

83
00:08:55,952 --> 00:08:59,046
- That's a nice-looking little girl.
- It's a boy.

84
00:09:00,389 --> 00:09:01,879
What's it like, Holley?

85
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,425
- Paris?
- Yeah.

86
00:09:03,492 --> 00:09:06,290
I spent my spare time in the art galleries.

87
00:09:06,362 --> 00:09:10,856
But I happened to hear about a place
that might interest you. Place Pigalle.

88
00:09:15,338 --> 00:09:16,737
Pig Alley.

89
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:20,207
Be sure to bring your dog tags,
because one night in Pig Alley...

90
00:09:20,276 --> 00:09:21,573
Excuse me.

91
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,213
Because you're going to think
you're the Caliph of Baghdad.

92
00:09:27,283 --> 00:09:29,513
You guys talk about Piccadilly Circus.

93
00:09:29,585 --> 00:09:33,112
Compared to Pig Alley,
it's like the quiet room in a limey YMCA.

94
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:37,921
How about you and me
boarding up in Paris?

95
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,121
What's the matter,
did Pop Stazak disown you?

96
00:09:40,196 --> 00:09:43,791
Pop can't go on account of his arthritis.

97
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:47,567
I love you, Roderigues. I love all of you.

98
00:09:48,237 --> 00:09:51,502
But I'm getting me a private room
and private bath in Paris...

99
00:09:51,574 --> 00:09:54,441
if I have to get it at the point of a gun.

100
00:09:54,577 --> 00:09:57,740
The big brain wants to get away
from us common people.

101
00:09:57,813 --> 00:10:01,806
He hasn't got anybody around here
to chat with about the Einstein Theory.

102
00:10:01,884 --> 00:10:04,148
What do you mean? He's got me.

103
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,517
There ain't nothing
we like to talk about better.

104
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:12,784
What happened to Lt. Belwick?
He was just your speed, Joe College.

105
00:10:13,629 --> 00:10:15,529
He got hit in Holland.

106
00:10:23,306 --> 00:10:27,902
It's all right, kid. Go right ahead.
Just brush me off when you're through.

107
00:10:37,353 --> 00:10:42,154
<i>- Holley, my boy, bonjour.
- Hiya. What are you busting out about?</i>

108
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,954
It's nothing at all, son.
It's hardly worth mentioning.

109
00:10:45,027 --> 00:10:48,019
They're just making me a civilian,
that's all.

110
00:10:48,497 --> 00:10:51,227
- They what?
- I wish I had arthritis.

111
00:10:51,767 --> 00:10:53,735
It ain't the arthritis.

112
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:55,899
They got a report from the Red Cross...

113
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:59,202
that my wife is too sick
to take care of the kids.

114
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:02,775
So I let them talk me into accepting
a dependency discharge.

115
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:04,642
Glad you made it, Pop.

116
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:08,775
Who's gonna adopt Roderigues?
He'd be lost without his Popsy Wopsy.

117
00:11:09,485 --> 00:11:13,216
One of these days
you're going to get a GI bootsie wootsie...

118
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:15,314
right square in those GI teeth.

119
00:11:15,891 --> 00:11:19,156
Such language. You should have
learned him better manners, Pop.

120
00:11:19,228 --> 00:11:21,662
- Knock it off, will you?
- When do you leave?

121
00:11:21,731 --> 00:11:24,791
Any day now. I have to sweat out
a letter of confirmation...

122
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:27,495
from our higher headquarters.
You'll be in Paris.

123
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:30,198
No, I decided to catch that football game.

124
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:33,400
That's swell. It'll be rugged
waiting around here all alone.

125
00:11:33,476 --> 00:11:36,843
See you in the morning, Johnny.
You gonna miss me, Abner?

126
00:11:36,912 --> 00:11:39,779
That's for dang sure.

127
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:44,711
I'm glad to see you guys
finally got the junk off my cot.

128
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:50,654
How about dousing that light?

129
00:11:51,093 --> 00:11:53,061
Paris trucks are leaving early.

130
00:11:53,329 --> 00:11:54,887
Okay, douse it.

131
00:12:23,592 --> 00:12:25,992
All right, roll out of them sacks.

132
00:12:26,061 --> 00:12:28,962
Hit it.
Leave your cots and grab your socks.

133
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:32,997
Let's go, men. You're slow.
Get them up, Wolowicz.

134
00:12:34,069 --> 00:12:36,469
- I ain't going to Paris.
- Nobody's going to Paris.

135
00:12:36,539 --> 00:12:39,736
- We're moving up. On trucks.
- Moving up? Where to?

136
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:42,107
Beats me. The Krauts
made a breakthrough someplace.

137
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:44,043
They tell me it's gonna be cold...

138
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:47,947
so wear your long johns and two pairs
of pants. Three, if you can get them on.

139
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:50,645
But they told us yesterday
we'd be off the line for good.

140
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:52,744
They didn't get the order
till after midnight.

141
00:12:52,822 --> 00:12:56,758
There's trucks this time instead of gliders.
That's a good sign, anyway.

142
00:12:57,293 --> 00:13:00,285
This is strictly for the birds, brother.

143
00:13:00,529 --> 00:13:04,158
Beats anything
ever I stuck my finger in before.

144
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,791
"General, I need a crack division
to plug up that gap."

145
00:13:07,937 --> 00:13:11,771
"A crack division, General?
I'd be honored if you'd use the 101st."

146
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:14,435
"Awfully nice of you, old boy.
Thanks a lot."

147
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:17,001
"Not at all, General."

148
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:24,684
Maybe the adjutant
can put in a phone call.

149
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,648
Yeah. It's only a technicality.

150
00:13:27,723 --> 00:13:30,487
- I forgot to tell you, men...
- Shut up!

151
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:35,595
It's a secret move,
so rip off your shoulder patches.

152
00:13:54,984 --> 00:13:59,148
Sarge, you got any of them
rubber overshoes, them galoshes?

153
00:13:59,688 --> 00:14:02,316
Can't fit you, Abner. Your feet's too small.

154
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:11,262
Take care of that gas mask, soldier.
It might save your life someday.

155
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,168
Yeah, if you can find some cognac.

156
00:14:15,638 --> 00:14:18,903
- No dice?
- I gotta wait for the letter. Regulations.

157
00:14:18,974 --> 00:14:22,102
It's gonna be a cold trip.
Maybe you can ride in the driver's cab.

158
00:14:22,177 --> 00:14:25,112
Wind it up.
Let's get this show on the road.

159
00:14:26,448 --> 00:14:29,383
- That the new platoon leader?
- Yeah, fresh off the boat.

160
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,817
I understand your problems, men.

161
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:35,788
- I used to be an enlisted man myself.
- For six months, maybe.

162
00:14:35,858 --> 00:14:39,055
And 17 weeks at OCS,
and he's an officer and gentleman...

163
00:14:39,128 --> 00:14:41,858
- by special act of Congress.
- Sound off!

164
00:14:42,164 --> 00:14:43,654
Shut up!

165
00:15:43,158 --> 00:15:46,321
- What did he say? Where are we?
- Are you kidding?

166
00:15:46,462 --> 00:15:49,056
<i>Do you speak French, sir?</i>

167
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:51,925
<i>Yes. Immediately.</i>

168
00:15:53,235 --> 00:15:56,329
<i>- Cigarette?
- Thank you very much.</i>

169
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:03,035
I don't smoke, but thanks anyway.
Thanks a lot.

170
00:16:11,954 --> 00:16:13,945
What time is it, Hansan?

171
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,554
- 11:30.
- What?

172
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,789
It can't be that late. We left at 2:00.

173
00:16:19,862 --> 00:16:22,695
11:30 a.m. Central Standard Time.

174
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:27,066
- Near lunchtime in Springfield.
- You never changed your watch?

175
00:16:27,336 --> 00:16:29,429
What's the use of changing your watch?

176
00:16:29,505 --> 00:16:33,100
What's the use? You're here,
you're not in Springfield, Illinois.

177
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,607
I hear you.

178
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:45,980
This is what I like about the infantry.
You always know just what's going on.

179
00:16:46,288 --> 00:16:49,155
How do you like this guy?
He don't like the infantry.

180
00:16:49,224 --> 00:16:51,886
- Must be off his nut.
- He never had it so good.

181
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:54,190
He found a home in the Army.

182
00:16:59,134 --> 00:17:01,659
Chewing gum? Cigarette for mama?

183
00:17:05,974 --> 00:17:07,407
Chocolate, please.

184
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,108
Isn't she cute?

185
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:12,472
Chewing gum? Cigarette for mama?

186
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:14,708
Here.

187
00:17:22,725 --> 00:17:24,522
Get a load of mama!

188
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:30,489
I'd like to keep her in chocolate
for about a week.

189
00:17:36,705 --> 00:17:38,798
What's she saying, Jarvess?

190
00:17:39,074 --> 00:17:43,135
She wants to know
if we'd like to come inside and warm up.

191
00:17:43,212 --> 00:17:47,615
- Yes. Warm up, please.
- Oh, brother!

192
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:27,554
- I like these secret moves.
- We sure slipped one over on the Krauts.

193
00:18:27,623 --> 00:18:29,921
How do they find out these things?
Who tells them?

194
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:33,223
- I keep them posted. Short wave.
- Somebody does.

195
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:35,395
They only occupied France for four years.

196
00:18:35,464 --> 00:18:37,932
Naturally they left a few spies
when they pulled out.

197
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,026
That's an idea.
Why don't us Gls hire some spies...

198
00:18:41,103 --> 00:18:43,731
so we'll know what's going on
once in a while?

199
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:48,802
Get them inside! Come on!

200
00:18:50,078 --> 00:18:51,773
On the double!

201
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,856
Kinnie, how about getting
these men in out of the hot sun?

202
00:19:04,927 --> 00:19:08,090
Wolowicz, Garby,
in there with the second platoon.

203
00:19:08,163 --> 00:19:09,687
This corner house.

204
00:19:13,602 --> 00:19:16,935
I forgot to tell you.
Put those shoulder patches back on.

205
00:19:17,005 --> 00:19:20,441
- Pop, I hear we're bedding down here.
- Overnight?

206
00:19:20,509 --> 00:19:24,104
Yeah. Looks like a good house, too.
Smoke coming out of the chimney.

207
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,238
For once, we get a break.

208
00:19:37,526 --> 00:19:42,293
Bastogne. I won't be forgetting
this place in a hurry.

209
00:19:42,464 --> 00:19:44,523
I wouldn't mind holing up here
till Christmas.

210
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:47,569
I hear tell we might.
All the rumors is good ones.

211
00:20:08,257 --> 00:20:12,091
<i>This is the United States Armed Forces
Radio Service broadcasting from London.</i>

212
00:20:12,160 --> 00:20:14,628
Let's see if we can get some news.

213
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:19,194
- What's he selling?
- Wait till he slows down.

214
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:24,030
<i>Ask her. I'll guarantee you
she can sprechen sie Deutsch.</i>

215
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,771
Let's live a little, Jarvess.

216
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:32,307
- Come on, mama, get yourself in gear.
- No, not mama.

217
00:20:33,115 --> 00:20:37,449
These two little children,
they live with me, but...

218
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:46,891
<i>Slowly, please.</i>

219
00:21:13,555 --> 00:21:16,183
She said she's not the mother
of the two little girls.

220
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:20,558
They're from a town near here.
Bombed out, both parents killed.

221
00:21:22,764 --> 00:21:24,857
They all got a sob story.

222
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:29,097
<i>- Let's cut a rug, Denise. Danser?
- No, we've cut enough.</i>

223
00:21:29,504 --> 00:21:33,634
You gotta keep paying these taxi dancers.
Fork over another chocolate bar.

224
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,937
What you say, please?

225
00:21:35,010 --> 00:21:37,308
I said do you think
the rain'll hurt the rhubarb?

226
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,710
What he say?

227
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:41,911
<i>Is there any coffee left?</i>

228
00:21:42,117 --> 00:21:45,780
<i>- Yes, plenty of coffee. Immediately.
- Thank you.</i>

229
00:21:45,854 --> 00:21:48,948
Anything you want.
Sure, as long as you pay for it.

230
00:21:49,091 --> 00:21:50,422
They're all alike here.

231
00:21:50,492 --> 00:21:54,189
Yes, they're all alike, Kipp.
Scared, hungry, lonely.

232
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:57,163
Come on, stop beating your gums.
Let a guy get some sleep.

233
00:21:57,232 --> 00:21:59,359
Yeah, it's about that time.

234
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:03,626
We sure come a far piece today.

235
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:07,539
- You okay, Kipp?
- Okay.

236
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,849
Poor tired soldiers.

237
00:22:20,555 --> 00:22:22,750
- You want?
- Thank you.

238
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:28,626
I go now?

239
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:33,000
I guess so. I'm all beat-up.

240
00:22:38,874 --> 00:22:41,570
It never fails.
Every time you meet a pretty babe...

241
00:22:41,643 --> 00:22:44,476
you're either out on your feet
or you get the order to move.

242
00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:47,344
- What you say, please?
- Nothing.

243
00:22:48,083 --> 00:22:50,745
- Thank you very much.
- All right.

244
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:58,157
Good night.

245
00:23:02,931 --> 00:23:05,126
- Where are you going?
- Guard.

246
00:23:19,448 --> 00:23:21,416
What did she say?

247
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:26,553
She said she's gonna hide the chocolate
from the kids till Christmas.

248
00:23:28,056 --> 00:23:30,854
I wish I knew for sure
we'd be here tomorrow.

249
00:23:30,926 --> 00:23:33,156
- You'll be here.
- Are you sure?

250
00:23:33,228 --> 00:23:35,560
All we do is lie around till the fog lifts...

251
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:39,066
so the air corps can come out
and win the war for us.

252
00:23:39,401 --> 00:23:42,234
In that case, I guess I'll take a chance.

253
00:23:42,304 --> 00:23:46,172
This may go down in history
as the greatest gamble of the war.

254
00:23:46,908 --> 00:23:49,741
- Good night, Denise.
- Good night, soldier.

255
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:54,582
Wolowicz, are you absolutely sure?

256
00:23:54,783 --> 00:23:57,115
Yeah, the C.O. Told us himself.

257
00:24:08,997 --> 00:24:11,124
Wake me up early, will you?

258
00:24:12,334 --> 00:24:13,699
<i>Maybe.</i>

259
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,981
I ought to report this
to the Inspector General.

260
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,649
There's supposed to be 18 inches
between bunks.

261
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:39,159
This is dangerous, spreads germs.

262
00:25:25,907 --> 00:25:28,535
There's some hot coffee on the stove.

263
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,210
I can use it.

264
00:25:32,047 --> 00:25:35,608
Don't worry about that plane.
It's one of ours, I think.

265
00:25:50,398 --> 00:25:52,195
Halt. Password.

266
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:54,326
- Hamburgers.
- Onions.

267
00:26:00,508 --> 00:26:02,806
I thought the 101st
was the only division here.

268
00:26:02,877 --> 00:26:05,243
They will be
as soon as the rest of us can get out.

269
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:07,440
- What's up?
- We were a little over to the east.

270
00:26:07,515 --> 00:26:11,007
Been there for weeks without firing a shot.
Then they started coming.

271
00:26:11,086 --> 00:26:14,920
Tanks, planes. Everything
you ever heard of and then some.

272
00:26:15,123 --> 00:26:17,455
A Jerry plane turned on a loudspeaker
in English.

273
00:26:17,525 --> 00:26:20,858
It said Hitler will give Paris
to the Germans for a Christmas present.

274
00:26:20,929 --> 00:26:23,864
But they told us
it was just a weak little counterattack.

275
00:26:23,932 --> 00:26:27,800
They'll probably tell you
that this is a strategic withdrawal.

276
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:49,513
<i>- Good morning, soldier.
- Bonjour.</i>

277
00:26:53,795 --> 00:26:55,820
I'll be back in a minute.

278
00:26:57,232 --> 00:27:00,395
Keep an eye on... What's going on?

279
00:27:00,468 --> 00:27:04,097
Me and Gen. McAuliffe decided to move
I Company up on the line.

280
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:07,437
- That is, if you agree.
- I should have known better.

281
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:11,100
Maybe she'll give you a refund
on those chocolate bars.

282
00:27:11,346 --> 00:27:13,780
How much time have I got?
Ten minutes? Five minutes?

283
00:27:13,848 --> 00:27:17,147
Anything you gotta do,
you better do in 30 seconds.

284
00:27:23,358 --> 00:27:25,349
Saddle up. Let's go, Holley.

285
00:29:16,938 --> 00:29:18,872
Drop your packs and rolls.

286
00:29:22,377 --> 00:29:25,778
Third platoon, on your feet.
We've got that patch of woods to clear.

287
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:28,839
Third platoon,
any time there's a dirty detail.

288
00:29:28,917 --> 00:29:32,011
Let's not be having
any talk like that, soldier.

289
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:34,745
Let's go.
Keep sight of the man on each side of you.

290
00:29:34,823 --> 00:29:36,723
Watch out for snipers.

291
00:29:49,404 --> 00:29:51,338
Snipers, the man says.

292
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:55,828
Second squad, over here. Dig in.

293
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:08,474
You're in charge till I get back.
I'm going to see the Lieutenant.

294
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:13,180
- Don't go volunteer for any patrols.
- Who do I dig with, Sergeant?

295
00:31:13,655 --> 00:31:17,887
That's right, we've got an odd man.
You can triple up with me and Hansan.

296
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,755
- Thanks. You want me to go with you?
- No, you stay and get the hole started.

297
00:31:21,829 --> 00:31:23,888
Come on, Hansan, let's go.

298
00:31:44,018 --> 00:31:47,112
Take ten, Jarvess.
Time for me to spare you.

299
00:32:32,133 --> 00:32:33,623
Get out of here.

300
00:32:34,802 --> 00:32:36,133
I'm sorry.

301
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:12,232
Let's not try to reach China this time.

302
00:33:12,707 --> 00:33:14,971
There's no sense digging
if you don't go deep.

303
00:33:15,043 --> 00:33:16,670
Last time we dug one together...

304
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:20,271
you went so deep that when I climbed out
I got the bends.

305
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,899
- How does it look?
- Great.

306
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:45,495
Only one thing wrong. We're moving.

307
00:33:46,641 --> 00:33:49,405
- What?
- You heard me. It ain't my idea.

308
00:33:49,911 --> 00:33:52,402
Saddle up, everybody, let's go.

309
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,243
Oh, no!

310
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,853
Just once I'd like to dig a foxhole...

311
00:34:07,929 --> 00:34:10,454
and find out that's the one I'm sleeping in.

312
00:34:18,372 --> 00:34:20,306
Will you stop yapping?

313
00:34:20,908 --> 00:34:24,139
First and third squads
gotta run patrols all night.

314
00:34:24,245 --> 00:34:26,543
- All we gotta do is...
- Standiferd, take over.

315
00:34:26,614 --> 00:34:30,050
- I'm pulling the first shift on the roadblock.
- Okay.

316
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:34,682
You better take a blanket with you.
This fog...

317
00:34:35,556 --> 00:34:37,319
really gets to you.

318
00:34:39,727 --> 00:34:42,127
I feel kind of woozy myself.

319
00:34:49,103 --> 00:34:50,764
Let's go, Hansan.

320
00:34:51,706 --> 00:34:54,470
Just get it started. We'll finish it up.

321
00:35:13,995 --> 00:35:16,725
When you were in that camp
in New York...

322
00:35:16,798 --> 00:35:19,164
- did you ever phone your wife?
- Sure.

323
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:21,758
- What did it cost?
- A nickel. What did you think?

324
00:35:21,836 --> 00:35:24,600
That's right. She came there to see you.

325
00:35:25,406 --> 00:35:27,738
Did you phone your kids long distance?

326
00:35:28,176 --> 00:35:30,269
Yeah, just before we shipped out.

327
00:35:30,511 --> 00:35:32,536
- Why?
- What did that cost?

328
00:35:32,747 --> 00:35:34,715
$2 for three minutes.

329
00:35:35,516 --> 00:35:38,280
- Why, Johnny?
- I was thinking...

330
00:35:39,086 --> 00:35:43,682
it's probably about as far from New York
to Wichita, where your kids were...

331
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:48,260
as it is from Wichita to Los Angeles,
where my folks are.

332
00:35:49,564 --> 00:35:51,759
And when you get back home...

333
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:54,593
what would that be, about 200 francs?

334
00:35:55,870 --> 00:35:58,065
I'll send you a bill, Johnny.

335
00:35:58,272 --> 00:35:59,933
Tell them that I...

336
00:36:01,976 --> 00:36:04,035
Well, you'll think of something.

337
00:36:04,145 --> 00:36:07,273
And if it runs over three minutes, it's okay.

338
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:38,401
Put out that fire. It's getting dark, Holley.

339
00:36:38,479 --> 00:36:41,141
Put on that steel pot
and get over to the roadblock.

340
00:36:41,215 --> 00:36:44,548
Three on a shift at night:
You, Kipp, and the new man.

341
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,452
They said to look out
for Krauts wearing GI uniforms.

342
00:36:47,521 --> 00:36:48,954
What about the password?

343
00:36:49,023 --> 00:36:52,049
That might be nice to know,
in case somebody thinks we're Krauts.

344
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:54,651
- Bug-jitter.
- Thanks.

345
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,408
Here, don't get any dirt in these eggs.

346
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:16,206
Okay, you get half of them.

347
00:37:39,807 --> 00:37:43,243
- How do you feel, Standiferd?
- Terrible.

348
00:37:45,713 --> 00:37:49,444
It's settling down in my chest.
I'm almost sure I have a fever.

349
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:52,916
I had a fever in Holland, but the medics
wouldn't let me off the line.

350
00:37:52,987 --> 00:37:55,820
You have to have 102. That's a regulation.

351
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,656
Listen to that voice. I can hardly talk.

352
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,361
Yeah, it sounds good.

353
00:38:21,115 --> 00:38:22,582
Halt! Password!

354
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:25,284
- Bug.
- Jitter.

355
00:38:30,858 --> 00:38:33,349
- What is this, Charlie Company?
- No, sir, ltem.

356
00:38:33,427 --> 00:38:36,624
I Company?
This must be the road to Neufchâteau.

357
00:38:36,864 --> 00:38:40,322
- I think it is.
- You want to be sure of things, soldier.

358
00:38:43,604 --> 00:38:46,368
- Is there a bridge up ahead?
- Yes, about half a mile out.

359
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,101
Good. Let's go.

360
00:38:54,415 --> 00:38:57,748
Smart cookie. Wearing his bars on patrol.

361
00:38:58,953 --> 00:39:00,511
Must be a new replacement.

362
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:18,805
Don't let that happen again.
Speak English.

363
00:39:18,873 --> 00:39:20,135
Yes, sir.

364
00:39:48,969 --> 00:39:51,096
Oh, no!

365
00:39:58,379 --> 00:40:00,540
Look, Pop, it's snowing!

366
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:07,587
I never saw snow up close before.
It's beautiful.

367
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:09,122
You didn't, by any chance hear...

368
00:40:09,190 --> 00:40:12,250
that it's kind of cold
and a little on the wet side, did you?

369
00:40:12,326 --> 00:40:14,521
Man, it's really coming down.

370
00:40:14,829 --> 00:40:18,663
Well, close the window, Johnny,
and fix that hole in the roof.

371
00:40:23,871 --> 00:40:26,863
You should know better
than to take off your boots in a foxhole.

372
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:29,375
You might want to start running fast.

373
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:34,038
- I can't sleep with wet boots on.
- Then wear your galoshes until they dry.

374
00:40:34,115 --> 00:40:36,140
I ain't got no galoshes.

375
00:41:08,816 --> 00:41:12,616
- Where did you get those branches?
- Where do you generally get branches?

376
00:41:12,686 --> 00:41:16,816
- I didn't know if the woods were cleared.
- Yeah, sure. K Company's in there.

377
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:18,618
- K Company?
- Yeah.

378
00:41:18,959 --> 00:41:21,086
I got a buddy in K Company.

379
00:41:30,404 --> 00:41:32,395
- Is this K Company?
- Yeah.

380
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,176
- Where will I find Hooper?
- Hooper? Never heard of him.

381
00:41:36,277 --> 00:41:38,438
Bill Hooper. I know he's in K Company.

382
00:41:38,512 --> 00:41:42,073
He's not in my platoon.
That first hole is the company C.P.

383
00:41:42,149 --> 00:41:44,140
- They'll know where he is.
- Thanks.

384
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,947
What platoon is Hooper in,
William J. Hooper?

385
00:41:51,325 --> 00:41:53,020
Nobody by that name in K Company.

386
00:41:53,093 --> 00:41:56,927
Yes, there is. He came in with
the new replacements just the other day.

387
00:41:57,164 --> 00:41:59,598
That was his name? Hey, Sergeant.

388
00:42:00,801 --> 00:42:02,029
What's up?

389
00:42:02,102 --> 00:42:05,970
That kid they got at last night,
name is Hooper. William J. Hooper.

390
00:42:07,208 --> 00:42:10,769
Now I can finish
making out my morning report. Thanks.

391
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:18,081
Direct hit on his foxhole. A mortar.
You don't hear them coming.

392
00:42:19,153 --> 00:42:20,950
You don't know what hit you.

393
00:42:22,823 --> 00:42:25,053
You didn't even know his name.

394
00:42:25,459 --> 00:42:27,859
We didn't even find his dog tags.

395
00:42:44,778 --> 00:42:47,372
<i>Chatsburg News.</i>

396
00:42:52,186 --> 00:42:54,780
<i>Li'I Abner gets one: The Dogpatch Gazette.</i>

397
00:42:54,855 --> 00:42:56,322
I'll take it.

398
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:06,166
- Sorry, Pop.
- It'll probably come up in the next batch.

399
00:43:07,568 --> 00:43:10,036
You act as if I want a discharge.

400
00:43:10,804 --> 00:43:12,533
Man, I like it here.

401
00:43:12,706 --> 00:43:17,006
Stick around, Kinnie. We're going
to choose up sides for a snowball fight.

402
00:43:20,914 --> 00:43:23,280
Hand these letters out
with the rations, Hansan.

403
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:26,046
They're all dinner, for once without coffee.

404
00:43:26,120 --> 00:43:29,647
Dinner rations, with that vitamin-packed
lemonade powder:

405
00:43:29,957 --> 00:43:33,825
"Simply add water
and serve ice-cold. Delicious."

406
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:38,221
- About that patrol, Kinnie...
- I can't let you go on it, Wolowicz.

407
00:43:38,599 --> 00:43:43,059
I want to be sure you'll be around to take
over the platoon if I have to go back.

408
00:43:43,137 --> 00:43:45,867
My feet froze up pretty bad last night.

409
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:48,934
I want three volunteers
to go out on a patrol.

410
00:43:49,009 --> 00:43:51,239
You, you, and you.
You're in charge, Holley.

411
00:43:51,312 --> 00:43:54,304
Why am I always volunteering for patrol?

412
00:43:55,115 --> 00:43:58,448
- I'm just a cowboy.
- All right, this is the deal, Holley.

413
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:03,017
G-2 says the Krauts
dropped some paratroops last night.

414
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:06,958
And they might be hiding in that patch
of woods on the other side of that farm.

415
00:44:07,027 --> 00:44:10,394
G-2. Wonderful how
they always know what's cooking.

416
00:44:10,464 --> 00:44:12,989
Well, I can tell you something
they do know.

417
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:18,068
Last night, some Krauts in GI uniforms
infiltrated right through this area.

418
00:44:18,605 --> 00:44:21,403
They blew up a bridge
on the road to Neufchâteau.

419
00:44:21,475 --> 00:44:23,841
Was one of them wearing lieutenant bars?

420
00:44:24,211 --> 00:44:26,941
- How did you know?
- We get all the latest rumors.

421
00:44:27,014 --> 00:44:29,710
Rumor, my eye.
They captured one of them.

422
00:44:29,783 --> 00:44:34,117
Spoke English perfect. Knew our
password, plan of deployment, everything.

423
00:44:36,357 --> 00:44:39,758
Kinnie, how about showing me
the way to the aid station?

424
00:44:39,827 --> 00:44:41,260
I'm freezing.

425
00:44:42,129 --> 00:44:44,962
- Feeling any better?
- Worse. Much worse.

426
00:44:45,032 --> 00:44:47,296
Never felt so sick in my life.

427
00:44:48,936 --> 00:44:51,166
Maybe I've even got pneumonia.

428
00:44:55,609 --> 00:44:57,099
He's really bad.

429
00:44:57,177 --> 00:45:00,669
Yeah, he's a cinch to go back
to the field hospital. Maybe even to Paris.

430
00:45:00,748 --> 00:45:04,115
I don't know. That penicillin...
He's liable to be back in a day.

431
00:45:04,184 --> 00:45:08,211
Yeah, a good, clean flesh wound is better.
Then they got to send you back.

432
00:45:10,491 --> 00:45:12,459
No, thanks. I don't smoke.

433
00:45:13,026 --> 00:45:16,154
Guys get sick, guys get wounded,
and nothing ever happens to me.

434
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,994
Nothing except that time
you broke your faux choppers.

435
00:45:19,066 --> 00:45:23,059
It was when you were back. Kipp found
out you can't keep a man on the line...

436
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:25,128
unless he's got
at least six teeth of his own.

437
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:26,729
I didn't know about that.

438
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,173
So he broke his GI teeth
with the butt of his rifle.

439
00:45:29,243 --> 00:45:30,938
I ran into a tree trunk in the dark.

440
00:45:31,011 --> 00:45:33,809
He was off the line for two weeks
getting a new set made.

441
00:45:33,881 --> 00:45:36,315
Let's get this patrol on the road.

442
00:45:38,919 --> 00:45:40,716
That's incoming mail.

443
00:45:51,899 --> 00:45:54,697
Holley, I think your eggs are about done.

444
00:45:58,372 --> 00:46:02,001
We've had good deals before,
but this is the best one yet.

445
00:46:02,209 --> 00:46:05,042
This is great. I don't ever wanna go back.

446
00:46:05,546 --> 00:46:07,639
I found a home in the Army.

447
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:26,029
Of course, you can see snow from LA.
Way off in the mountains.

448
00:46:33,507 --> 00:46:36,271
They got us zeroed in.
I'm getting out of here.

449
00:46:44,651 --> 00:46:48,348
I hope he makes it. They should
never have sent him back on the line.

450
00:46:48,422 --> 00:46:50,652
Some guys just can't take it.

451
00:46:53,694 --> 00:46:56,561
Wolowicz, there's something
I want you to know.

452
00:46:56,997 --> 00:46:58,692
My name is Layton.

453
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:02,664
- I know it is.
- I just wanted to be sure.

454
00:47:07,608 --> 00:47:08,802
Thanks.

455
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,991
This is what G-2 calls a patch of woods.

456
00:48:05,065 --> 00:48:07,431
A whole division
could be hiding in that forest.

457
00:48:07,501 --> 00:48:09,435
Nice job for a three-man patrol.

458
00:48:09,503 --> 00:48:13,963
Yeah, if we don't get back, that's how
they'll know we ran into some Krauts.

459
00:48:28,789 --> 00:48:30,916
- What's the password?
- Texas.

460
00:48:31,558 --> 00:48:33,992
Keep them covered. They may be German.

461
00:48:34,061 --> 00:48:38,054
- Any line on these woods, Major?
- I didn't hear the countersign.

462
00:48:38,632 --> 00:48:40,759
Leaguer. Texas Leaguer.

463
00:48:41,101 --> 00:48:43,331
Will this road take us
to Third Bat headquarters?

464
00:48:43,403 --> 00:48:45,132
- Straight ahead.
- Get going.

465
00:48:45,205 --> 00:48:49,141
- Just a minute. What is a Texas leaguer?
- How's that?

466
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:53,673
- I said what's a Texas leaguer?
- It's some kind of baseball term.

467
00:48:53,747 --> 00:48:56,375
- What kind?
- A safe hit just over the infielder's head...

468
00:48:56,450 --> 00:48:58,577
Nobody asked you.
How'd the Dodgers make out?

469
00:48:58,652 --> 00:49:02,110
- Who's your commanding officer?
- He knows how the Dodgers made out.

470
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,520
- Let's see your dog tags.
- What?

471
00:49:03,590 --> 00:49:06,286
We're not taking any chances.

472
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,157
What is this?

473
00:49:08,228 --> 00:49:12,631
What kind of nonsense...

474
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:15,194
Drop those rifles.

475
00:49:16,003 --> 00:49:18,198
- Who's Betty Grable going with?
- Cesar Romero.

476
00:49:18,271 --> 00:49:21,172
<i>- Quiet. Who's the Dragon Lady?
- She's in Terry and the Pirates.</i>

477
00:49:21,241 --> 00:49:22,902
- What's a hotrod?
- A hopped-up jalopy.

478
00:49:22,976 --> 00:49:25,911
- Joe, what do you know?
- Just got back from a vaudeville show.

479
00:49:25,979 --> 00:49:28,846
- I guess they're okay.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

480
00:49:28,915 --> 00:49:33,409
PFC, Major. Praying For Civilian.
That's why I believe in being careful.

481
00:49:33,553 --> 00:49:36,647
May I suggest, sir,
that you study up on baseball?

482
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,486
I guess I'd better.

483
00:49:38,592 --> 00:49:42,358
By the way, you might tell your buddy
that Cesar Romero is out.

484
00:49:42,429 --> 00:49:44,624
She's married to Harry James.

485
00:49:49,836 --> 00:49:51,098
Let's go.

486
00:50:27,374 --> 00:50:30,172
They really should have sent out
a bigger patrol.

487
00:50:30,677 --> 00:50:34,010
- Lf you want to goof off...
- Who said anything about goofing off?

488
00:50:34,081 --> 00:50:35,275
Nobody.

489
00:50:35,382 --> 00:50:37,748
I'm just saying
the best way is to tell them...

490
00:50:37,818 --> 00:50:40,309
you heard voices talking in German.

491
00:50:40,587 --> 00:50:44,853
Let's say we heard voices talking
in Japanese and let G-2 figure that out.

492
00:50:51,965 --> 00:50:53,728
That paper any good?

493
00:50:55,068 --> 00:50:58,333
<i>Best in the world. Sedalia News.</i>

494
00:51:02,442 --> 00:51:06,503
Keep your gloves off for two minutes and
you'd have Popsicles instead of fingers.

495
00:51:06,713 --> 00:51:08,112
Get a load of this.

496
00:51:08,181 --> 00:51:11,378
"Our Changing Times,
by Mrs. Donald Jarvess...

497
00:51:11,451 --> 00:51:14,887
"pinch-hitting for your favorite columnist
and her favorite husband...

498
00:51:14,955 --> 00:51:17,185
"now on active duty, US Army."

499
00:51:18,225 --> 00:51:20,090
You knew I worked on a newspaper.

500
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,321
Yeah, but a column?
You must be pretty good.

501
00:51:22,395 --> 00:51:26,161
I was too good. I wrote a piece
about the real meaning of the war...

502
00:51:26,233 --> 00:51:30,033
the fight against Fascism, why every
American had to get in there and pitch in.

503
00:51:30,103 --> 00:51:33,163
The logic was magnificent.
You couldn't resist it.

504
00:51:34,241 --> 00:51:37,005
The next thing I knew,
I was in a troop train...

505
00:51:37,544 --> 00:51:39,569
waving bye-bye to my wife.

506
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:44,112
- Came the dawn?
- Yeah.

507
00:51:45,585 --> 00:51:48,884
Only one thing gets me.
When you work on a newspaper...

508
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:51,648
I'd get those wire releases...

509
00:51:51,725 --> 00:51:56,059
and know that I was the first person
in town who had the news. All the news.

510
00:51:56,963 --> 00:52:00,729
I'll guarantee you, my wife knows
what's going on in Bastogne.

511
00:52:01,601 --> 00:52:04,161
All I know is
what's happening to the second squad...

512
00:52:04,237 --> 00:52:06,467
in the third platoon of I Company.

513
00:52:14,181 --> 00:52:15,705
Watch this one.

514
00:52:20,453 --> 00:52:21,647
Strike!

515
00:52:22,589 --> 00:52:25,114
Can't hit them if you can't see them.

516
00:52:29,362 --> 00:52:31,990
Now the count's three and two.

517
00:52:32,465 --> 00:52:36,401
Man on first and third.
Two out. This is the one that counts.

518
00:52:49,516 --> 00:52:52,349
Foul ball. Come on, let's have a fast one.

519
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:54,610
Burn it in, boy. Come on.

520
00:52:59,693 --> 00:53:01,251
A hit right over second base.

521
00:53:01,328 --> 00:53:04,320
There, the center fielder
made a shoestring catch. You're out.

522
00:53:04,698 --> 00:53:07,223
- How about it, ump?
- Sound off, pal. Password?

523
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,393
Don't you get it? Right over second base.

524
00:53:09,469 --> 00:53:11,494
- Texas.
- Leaguer.

525
00:53:11,738 --> 00:53:14,229
- You in charge?
- No, the lieutenant.

526
00:53:16,343 --> 00:53:17,833
Hiya, fellows.

527
00:53:20,080 --> 00:53:21,638
What's the situation, Lieutenant?

528
00:53:21,715 --> 00:53:24,684
Nothing but pine trees in these woods.
We've been through them.

529
00:53:24,751 --> 00:53:27,914
- I guess our mission's accomplished.
- Courtesy of K Company.

530
00:53:27,988 --> 00:53:30,980
You can tell them to stop worrying
about this area.

531
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,854
Them and us both, Lieutenant. Thanks.

532
00:53:34,594 --> 00:53:37,427
<i>- I guess we might as well partie.
- So long.</i>

533
00:53:37,497 --> 00:53:39,522
- So long.
- So long, fellows.

534
00:53:56,082 --> 00:53:58,778
Come on, on the double. They're Krauts.

535
00:55:38,752 --> 00:55:39,980
Come on!

536
00:55:47,227 --> 00:55:48,956
Kraut tanks!

537
00:55:56,803 --> 00:55:58,293
No. Take off, will you?

538
00:55:58,371 --> 00:56:01,636
If they think we're all getting away,
maybe I've got a chance.

539
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:04,108
- Go on.
- We'll send a patrol back.

540
00:56:12,752 --> 00:56:16,017
- Don't forget the sulfa powder.
- Go on, get in there.

541
00:56:56,262 --> 00:56:57,524
Let's go.

542
00:57:36,336 --> 00:57:39,897
- You're sure they were enemy tanks?
- We saw them, Lieutenant.

543
00:57:39,973 --> 00:57:43,067
Think we've got enough
antitank grenades to do any good?

544
00:57:43,143 --> 00:57:44,770
We ain't got any.

545
00:58:04,297 --> 00:58:07,027
Mind if I make a suggestion, Lieutenant?

546
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,624
What?

547
00:58:08,701 --> 00:58:12,660
Sir, our usual defense against tanks
is to call for artillery...

548
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:14,832
and then run like a jackrabbit.

549
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:17,240
We've got orders to hold these positions.

550
00:58:17,310 --> 00:58:21,508
All right, sir, but let's call for artillery
and keep our heads down.

551
00:58:21,648 --> 00:58:26,017
We could send out some bazooka men,
if we had any bazookas.

552
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:30,416
- Put in a call for artillery.
- Yes, sir.

553
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:41,692
What a break.
Artillery's got that farmhouse zeroed in.

554
00:58:42,402 --> 00:58:44,063
Concentration 17.

555
00:58:47,273 --> 00:58:48,968
Item three to ltem:

556
00:58:49,108 --> 00:58:52,339
Kraut tanks by burning farmhouse.

557
00:58:52,879 --> 00:58:54,847
Concentration 17.

558
00:58:57,850 --> 00:58:59,943
Roger. Start the fireworks.

559
00:59:00,587 --> 00:59:03,078
That's great. Artillery can't miss.

560
00:59:03,156 --> 00:59:06,353
They've got Roderigues to use
for an aiming stick.

561
00:59:06,426 --> 00:59:10,328
Tell Wolowicz to send out for Roderigues
as soon as this barrage lifts.

562
00:59:10,396 --> 00:59:12,364
With what, a sponge?

563
00:59:14,067 --> 00:59:17,230
I've got to get me a rifle.
Any extra ones, Garby?

564
00:59:17,303 --> 00:59:19,635
No, we haven't had any casualties yet.

565
00:59:19,706 --> 00:59:22,174
There's a rifle waiting for you, Holley.

566
00:59:22,242 --> 00:59:24,972
Your squad sent for the meat wagon
after the last shelling.

567
00:59:25,044 --> 00:59:27,103
- Who was hit, Doc?
- Wolowicz.

568
00:59:44,163 --> 00:59:45,528
Is he bad?

569
00:59:45,765 --> 00:59:48,199
A shell landed
right on the edge of his foxhole.

570
00:59:48,268 --> 00:59:50,293
His shoulder's like a sieve.

571
00:59:52,639 --> 00:59:56,131
- Where's your steel pot, soldier?
- I lost it, Sergeant.

572
00:59:57,377 --> 01:00:00,608
You can try mine on for size... Sergeant.

573
01:00:02,081 --> 01:00:03,878
You're in charge now.

574
01:00:05,151 --> 01:00:07,449
Leadership. That's what I got.

575
01:00:18,731 --> 01:00:20,460
Where's Roderigues?

576
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:22,963
He'll be along, Pop.

577
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:27,601
Should have worn my shoulder pads.

578
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:33,002
In a couple of months you'll be flipping
those forward passes as good as ever.

579
01:00:33,079 --> 01:00:35,673
Yeah, left-handed.

580
01:00:43,589 --> 01:00:45,557
He's a good man, Holley...

581
01:00:46,759 --> 01:00:48,556
but still a little jumpy.

582
01:00:49,295 --> 01:00:51,126
He can move in with me.

583
01:00:52,532 --> 01:00:54,159
You could do worse.

584
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,865
He sleeps warm and quiet.

585
01:00:58,471 --> 01:01:01,736
His name's Layton. Jim Layton.

586
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,768
- So long, Wolowicz.
- Take it easy.

587
01:01:05,845 --> 01:01:07,642
Say hello to Standiferd.

588
01:01:09,182 --> 01:01:12,709
- Hansan, you can move in with Pop.
- What about Roderigues?

589
01:01:14,187 --> 01:01:16,087
Is that incoming mail?

590
01:01:17,290 --> 01:01:20,259
No, it's outgoing.
There'll be plenty more of it.

591
01:01:20,326 --> 01:01:24,888
- What time is it, Hansan?
- 10:30. No, it must be 11:30 here.

592
01:01:26,232 --> 01:01:27,961
Where's Roderigues?

593
01:01:30,803 --> 01:01:32,668
Let's take a walk, Pop.

594
01:01:43,583 --> 01:01:46,950
How much longer
are they going to leave him out there?

595
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:54,189
<i>Let's partie.
We can carry him back in this blanket.</i>

596
01:01:54,294 --> 01:01:56,262
I want three volunteers.

597
01:02:03,903 --> 01:02:05,734
It's a long walk, Pop.

598
01:02:11,044 --> 01:02:14,036
- I need a fourth for bridge.
- I'll be the dummy.

599
01:02:14,948 --> 01:02:16,677
You don't have to, Layton.

600
01:02:17,417 --> 01:02:19,681
Maybe you'll find some more eggs.

601
01:02:23,990 --> 01:02:26,754
What are you looking for, Kipp,
your discharge?

602
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:28,953
- I lost my teeth.
- You lost them?

603
01:02:29,028 --> 01:02:32,156
They were searching me on
a roadblock, so I put them in my pocket.

604
01:02:32,232 --> 01:02:34,564
- And they jumped out?
- Dropped out.

605
01:02:35,235 --> 01:02:38,432
I hope it's nice and warm
back where you're going.

606
01:02:39,572 --> 01:02:42,234
I can't chew on K rations with my gums.

607
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,412
No! Keep your eye open.

608
01:04:16,135 --> 01:04:20,265
He used to see snow
way off in the mountains.

609
01:04:23,142 --> 01:04:25,838
They say it's just like going to sleep.

610
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,690
He was a religious kid.

611
01:04:42,595 --> 01:04:44,495
When anyone got hit...

612
01:04:45,265 --> 01:04:48,632
he used to say it was God's will.

613
01:05:33,875 --> 01:05:36,070
- What's the Bulge?
- Search me.

614
01:05:37,179 --> 01:05:41,047
"Hitler's mighty counteroffensive swept on
yesterday under a news eclipse...

615
01:05:41,116 --> 01:05:45,644
"from which filtered the fact that German
armor had plunged 20 miles into Belgium."

616
01:05:46,254 --> 01:05:47,516
We're in Belgium, aren't we?

617
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:50,149
Thought it was Luxembourg.
Let's see that.

618
01:05:51,393 --> 01:05:54,988
"War Department authorities report
that morale is high all along the front.

619
01:05:55,063 --> 01:05:57,964
"Battle-hardened doughboys
fresh from epic-making triumphs..."

620
01:05:58,033 --> 01:05:59,728
Skip the commercial, Jarvess.

621
01:05:59,801 --> 01:06:03,032
"Air activity was halted by
thick, swirling fog.

622
01:06:08,143 --> 01:06:10,577
"At Bastogne, the 101st Airborne..."

623
01:06:10,646 --> 01:06:12,136
Hey, that's us.

624
01:06:13,448 --> 01:06:17,509
Then you'll be proud to know
that you are making a heroic stand...

625
01:06:17,586 --> 01:06:21,317
"hurling back the best
that Von Rundstedt can throw at you."

626
01:06:21,423 --> 01:06:25,655
- Who's Von Rundstedt?
- A Kraut general. The best they've got.

627
01:06:25,794 --> 01:06:28,058
Is the 101st the only division up here?

628
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:30,655
It doesn't say.
We'll have to wait for the next edition.

629
01:06:30,732 --> 01:06:34,031
- Where's Pop Stazak?
- Him and Hansan are on a roadblock.

630
01:06:34,102 --> 01:06:36,900
Well, this might be it. It looks official.

631
01:06:37,639 --> 01:06:39,163
<i>Chatsburg News.</i>

632
01:06:47,449 --> 01:06:49,440
<i>And The Dogpatch Gazette.</i>

633
01:06:51,386 --> 01:06:55,288
Get back to the aid station, Kinnie,
before those feet of yours get any worse.

634
01:06:55,357 --> 01:06:58,383
They won't take frozen feet
unless they start to change color.

635
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:02,829
No combat fatigue, no fever cases.
You have to be bleeding from a wound.

636
01:07:02,931 --> 01:07:05,559
All they got at the aid station
is aspirin and iodine.

637
01:07:05,634 --> 01:07:08,432
- What about the field hospital?
- Captured.

638
01:07:09,805 --> 01:07:13,206
Medics, casualties, equipment, the works.

639
01:07:13,275 --> 01:07:16,210
It must have been after the meat wagon
got there with Wolowicz.

640
01:07:16,278 --> 01:07:20,305
I guess Standiferd was there, too.
Some of the walking wounded were killed.

641
01:07:20,382 --> 01:07:23,647
They say the fight they put up
was one for the book.

642
01:07:40,469 --> 01:07:44,803
Layton, you're learning too fast.
How about spelling me for a bit?

643
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:49,142
The dreams are getting better all the time.

644
01:07:49,678 --> 01:07:52,010
I was back home in Baltimore...

645
01:07:52,814 --> 01:07:56,375
Ioading up on hard-shell crabs and beer.

646
01:07:57,018 --> 01:07:59,612
That dream's against regulation, soldier.

647
01:07:59,688 --> 01:08:02,953
You know what our boys overseas
always dream about.

648
01:08:03,291 --> 01:08:06,124
- Mom's blueberry pie.
- Why, certainly!

649
01:08:06,528 --> 01:08:09,986
That's what we're fighting for.
Boy, when I get home...

650
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:13,859
just give me a hot dog
and a slice of that pie.

651
01:08:14,236 --> 01:08:16,932
Am I gonna kick if I don't get my job back?

652
01:08:17,005 --> 01:08:20,168
No sirree. All I want is a...

653
01:08:24,980 --> 01:08:26,311
So long, Holley.

654
01:08:27,282 --> 01:08:28,715
So long, Pop.

655
01:08:28,784 --> 01:08:31,810
<i>- Au revoir.
- I found them!</i>

656
01:08:31,887 --> 01:08:34,856
I found them in another pocket!

657
01:08:35,290 --> 01:08:39,124
You're just in time to work Pop's shift.
Go up and get Hansan.

658
01:08:39,861 --> 01:08:43,854
- Where you going?
- Special Orders, Number 1437:

659
01:08:44,166 --> 01:08:47,192
"Private Ernest J. Stazak
will proceed to Paris...

660
01:08:47,269 --> 01:08:50,466
"where transportation to the US
will be arranged."

661
01:08:50,539 --> 01:08:53,531
- Relax, chum. You ain't going no place.
- I ain't?

662
01:08:53,909 --> 01:08:56,070
Here, read it yourself.

663
01:08:57,012 --> 01:08:58,343
I don't care what it says.

664
01:08:58,413 --> 01:09:01,644
Nobody's leaving Bastogne,
and nobody's coming in...

665
01:09:01,983 --> 01:09:06,317
except maybe some Krauts riding tanks.
We're surrounded.

666
01:09:07,022 --> 01:09:08,455
Surrounded?

667
01:09:11,827 --> 01:09:13,692
If this is one of your crummy jokes...

668
01:09:13,762 --> 01:09:16,629
I'll knock those GI teeth
right down your throat.

669
01:09:23,505 --> 01:09:25,496
Take it easy, Pop.

670
01:09:25,574 --> 01:09:29,635
He wouldn't have those teeth back
in his mouth if there was any way out.

671
01:09:51,867 --> 01:09:53,494
Tough break, Pop.

672
01:09:55,537 --> 01:09:59,234
You know,
I can get them in a lot of trouble for this.

673
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:03,875
It's against the rules of war
to shoot at civilians.

674
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:10,042
I'm sorry, Kipp.

675
01:10:38,179 --> 01:10:41,273
Them poor devils
in the footslogging infantry...

676
01:10:41,816 --> 01:10:44,444
nothing but walk, walk, walk.

677
01:10:44,519 --> 01:10:46,544
The airborne, that's the life.

678
01:10:46,621 --> 01:10:50,819
It's great up here in these gliders,
drifting along over the clouds.

679
01:11:17,686 --> 01:11:20,553
They're liable to have you up
in juvenile court for smoking.

680
01:11:20,622 --> 01:11:22,817
This your first time
away from home, Layton?

681
01:11:22,891 --> 01:11:26,122
Basic training was.
That wasn't quite the same.

682
01:11:27,028 --> 01:11:29,690
My folks stayed for a while
at a town near camp.

683
01:11:29,764 --> 01:11:33,894
Did Mama rub your little footsies
after those nasty 20-mile hikes?

684
01:11:35,737 --> 01:11:38,467
She made me brush my teeth
twice a day...

685
01:11:38,974 --> 01:11:41,772
so I wouldn't have to
have them all pulled out.

686
01:11:50,552 --> 01:11:52,383
- Hey, look at that.
- What?

687
01:11:53,088 --> 01:11:56,148
I thought it was a shadow.
It's just some burnt-out powder.

688
01:11:56,224 --> 01:11:59,284
You'll die of old age
before you see a shadow around here.

689
01:11:59,361 --> 01:12:01,454
This fog ain't never gonna lift.

690
01:12:01,696 --> 01:12:05,063
Did the planes have to wait?
Haven't they ever heard of flying blind?

691
01:12:05,133 --> 01:12:07,465
Nobody cares. They just don't care.

692
01:12:07,535 --> 01:12:09,264
I don't believe that, Kipp.

693
01:12:09,337 --> 01:12:12,170
Reverend Layton
will now lead us in prayer.

694
01:12:12,440 --> 01:12:14,408
Might not be a bad idea.

695
01:12:18,179 --> 01:12:20,875
The C.O. Says you're to dig in
at that railroad embankment.

696
01:12:20,949 --> 01:12:23,315
The rest of the company's
moving back 500 yards.

697
01:12:23,385 --> 01:12:24,511
Right.

698
01:12:27,522 --> 01:12:31,856
Third platoon,
whenever there's a dirty detail.

699
01:12:34,029 --> 01:12:36,520
Let's go, men. On your feet.

700
01:12:52,647 --> 01:12:55,047
Check your rifles. See if they're froze up.

701
01:12:55,116 --> 01:12:57,812
Listen to Holley,
making a noise like a sergeant.

702
01:12:57,886 --> 01:13:02,016
He's really GI now since he took over
the squad. Right on the ball.

703
01:13:02,524 --> 01:13:04,958
Yeah. Strictly chicken, that's me.

704
01:13:05,593 --> 01:13:07,823
Let's be chicken those bolts.

705
01:13:14,302 --> 01:13:15,963
Check your rifles.

706
01:13:46,901 --> 01:13:49,369
Why can't they pass down
some information?

707
01:13:50,105 --> 01:13:53,268
If a man gets hit, he must at least know
what country he's dying in.

708
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:56,037
Now, that's for sure. That's for dang sure.

709
01:13:56,111 --> 01:13:57,772
I've asked you 800 times...

710
01:13:57,846 --> 01:14:01,338
I won't say that no more, Jarvess.
That's for sure.

711
01:15:13,855 --> 01:15:15,379
Can't see them.

712
01:17:47,075 --> 01:17:48,906
I'm with you, Holley.

713
01:17:50,778 --> 01:17:52,006
Come on.

714
01:18:16,504 --> 01:18:20,099
Second squad! You, too, Mac! Follow me!

715
01:18:23,745 --> 01:18:25,212
Let's go, Abner!

716
01:18:37,492 --> 01:18:39,653
Mama.

717
01:18:57,111 --> 01:18:58,874
Wait till it clears.

718
01:20:02,410 --> 01:20:03,968
Hold your fire.

719
01:20:24,465 --> 01:20:27,298
Tell them to come out with their hands up.

720
01:20:59,667 --> 01:21:03,125
Layton, you and Joe
check them for maps and papers.

721
01:21:04,906 --> 01:21:06,601
See if any of them are still kicking.

722
01:21:26,160 --> 01:21:29,129
Get the prisoners and wounded
back to Bastogne, Sergeant.

723
01:21:29,196 --> 01:21:31,391
See if we've got enough men left, Holley.

724
01:21:31,465 --> 01:21:34,161
I'm going to put this man in
for a Silver Star.

725
01:21:56,657 --> 01:22:00,821
You know, a guy ought to be able to get
$100 for this back in Paris.

726
01:22:06,934 --> 01:22:10,631
I thought Holley was running away.
That's why I ran after him.

727
01:22:10,705 --> 01:22:12,468
How do you know
what Holley was thinking?

728
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:15,031
How do you know if he was thinking at all?

729
01:22:15,109 --> 01:22:16,269
Things just happen.

730
01:22:16,344 --> 01:22:19,609
Afterwards you try to figure out
why you acted the way you did.

731
01:22:19,680 --> 01:22:22,774
I know why I ran. I was scared to death.

732
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:26,647
You just joined the biggest club
in the Army. Everybody belongs.

733
01:22:26,721 --> 01:22:31,158
Just drop me off at the psycho ward.
Why did I have to get up and start firing?

734
01:22:31,225 --> 01:22:32,920
A good thing somebody did.

735
01:22:32,994 --> 01:22:36,122
Yeah. It didn't have to be me. A volunteer.

736
01:22:36,397 --> 01:22:39,332
It happened so fast,
you had no time to look at your watch.

737
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:42,233
Yeah, sure forgot what time it was
in Springfield.

738
01:22:42,303 --> 01:22:45,568
- Hansan, I hate to ask you, but...
- You can have it.

739
01:22:52,847 --> 01:22:54,678
Let's get out of here, chum.

740
01:23:12,933 --> 01:23:14,366
Thanks, Pop.

741
01:23:16,003 --> 01:23:17,630
I'll drop back later.

742
01:23:17,705 --> 01:23:19,832
Just don't get carried back.

743
01:23:28,282 --> 01:23:31,479
Say, miss, how about giving him a shot?

744
01:23:34,822 --> 01:23:36,551
Morphine. Him.

745
01:23:41,829 --> 01:23:43,387
No more morphine?

746
01:23:44,665 --> 01:23:46,064
That's great.

747
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:22,397
She pours him one more,
I'm gonna get myself shot.

748
01:24:38,586 --> 01:24:40,315
They're way too big.

749
01:24:42,223 --> 01:24:44,384
I wished we'd found them yesterday.

750
01:24:47,228 --> 01:24:48,820
Let's go, men. Chow!

751
01:24:48,896 --> 01:24:51,694
- What?
- You heard me. Hot chow!

752
01:24:57,605 --> 01:25:01,006
I've been pulling KP ever since.
We was bombed out twice.

753
01:25:01,075 --> 01:25:03,373
I'm telling you,
I never saw so much incoming mail.

754
01:25:03,444 --> 01:25:05,844
Yeah, things are getting rough all over.

755
01:25:08,082 --> 01:25:09,913
I wanted to go back on the line.

756
01:25:09,984 --> 01:25:12,179
But they're short-handed
in the kitchen, see.

757
01:25:12,253 --> 01:25:14,619
A couple more KPs got hit this morning.

758
01:25:15,189 --> 01:25:17,749
I wouldn't mind a little action
for a change.

759
01:25:19,260 --> 01:25:20,818
How about you and me switching?

760
01:25:20,895 --> 01:25:24,456
Oh, no. They'd never let me go.
I've been learning how to cook.

761
01:25:25,699 --> 01:25:29,032
- Bettis, anything left?
- No.

762
01:25:29,503 --> 01:25:31,698
But it's clean. It's only leftovers.

763
01:25:33,440 --> 01:25:35,135
I don't even see those things.

764
01:25:35,209 --> 01:25:37,575
I wanna see them.
I wanna remember them.

765
01:25:45,820 --> 01:25:49,381
We'll start back in about an hour.
Better stick around this area.

766
01:25:50,324 --> 01:25:51,723
Where's the kid?

767
01:25:51,992 --> 01:25:55,655
Who, Layton? He's in the barn, I guess,
putting on those dry clothes.

768
01:25:55,729 --> 01:25:58,562
Bettis, how about breaking loose
with a bottle of cognac?

769
01:25:58,632 --> 01:25:59,792
We ain't got any.

770
01:25:59,867 --> 01:26:02,335
I'll settle for some hot water
to wash my feet in.

771
01:26:02,403 --> 01:26:03,995
Coming right up.

772
01:26:11,812 --> 01:26:14,337
Bettis, you got any trading material?

773
01:26:14,415 --> 01:26:18,112
The belly robber keeps everything locked.
But there's half a loaf of bread.

774
01:26:18,185 --> 01:26:19,948
A half a loaf is...

775
01:26:20,454 --> 01:26:21,853
Where is it?

776
01:26:23,123 --> 01:26:25,591
I could have sworn it was on that table.

777
01:26:38,038 --> 01:26:39,767
Hello, soldier.

778
01:26:49,383 --> 01:26:51,351
Pull up a chair, Holley.

779
01:26:56,123 --> 01:26:58,091
Today you are a man.

780
01:27:21,282 --> 01:27:23,216
This is Antwerp, up here.

781
01:27:24,618 --> 01:27:27,485
To the north and the east
are the British and the Canadians.

782
01:27:27,554 --> 01:27:31,615
Down at Belfort, over 300 miles away,
is the French First Army.

783
01:27:32,359 --> 01:27:35,419
The Americans are stretched out
all the way in between.

784
01:27:36,997 --> 01:27:38,760
If the supply line to Antwerp is cut...

785
01:27:38,832 --> 01:27:42,131
at least 20 Allied divisions
will be strictly out on a limb.

786
01:27:42,403 --> 01:27:44,132
- Where's Bastogne?
- There.

787
01:27:46,006 --> 01:27:49,066
This is where the Krauts
found a soft spot in our line.

788
01:27:50,344 --> 01:27:52,039
You see why Bastogne is so important.

789
01:27:52,112 --> 01:27:54,637
It's at the main intersection
of seven main highways...

790
01:27:54,715 --> 01:27:57,183
one of them leading straight to Antwerp.

791
01:27:57,318 --> 01:27:59,309
Don't know if we can hold out.

792
01:28:00,120 --> 01:28:02,020
That sounds like ours.

793
01:28:04,925 --> 01:28:06,290
It is ours!

794
01:28:10,898 --> 01:28:12,160
Can't see a thing.

795
01:28:12,232 --> 01:28:14,598
The supplies they've got to drop,
we wouldn't want.

796
01:28:14,668 --> 01:28:16,431
A crate of eggs for Berlin.

797
01:28:16,503 --> 01:28:19,028
If bombers can get through,
why can't C-47s?

798
01:28:19,106 --> 01:28:20,164
In this pea soup?

799
01:28:20,240 --> 01:28:23,141
- They're flying way over, you know that.
- The air corps.

800
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:26,236
London this morning,
Berlin this afternoon. Headlines tomorrow.

801
01:28:26,313 --> 01:28:29,840
Fellows, come on back.
It's getting lonesome here!

802
01:28:30,317 --> 01:28:32,979
Nobody cares. They just don't care.

803
01:28:33,954 --> 01:28:35,581
You can say that again.

804
01:28:40,961 --> 01:28:43,361
I thought they had us surrounded.

805
01:28:43,797 --> 01:28:44,889
Halt.

806
01:28:52,573 --> 01:28:55,542
I speak English. Who is here in command?

807
01:28:56,043 --> 01:28:58,204
I am here in command.

808
01:28:58,612 --> 01:29:01,172
We have a message
for the commanding general.

809
01:29:01,715 --> 01:29:04,775
I'll get a jeep and take the officers back.
Blindfold them.

810
01:29:25,706 --> 01:29:27,367
Try it again, Jarvess.

811
01:29:35,182 --> 01:29:37,980
All I can get out of them
is their name and rank.

812
01:29:40,020 --> 01:29:41,988
Loosen up, chum. Give us the lowdown.

813
01:29:42,056 --> 01:29:44,081
You can talk now. Hitler kaput.

814
01:29:48,429 --> 01:29:50,795
How would you like some nice K rations?

815
01:30:08,549 --> 01:30:12,508
Now we're getting somewhere.
He says he'll talk for a pack of cigarettes.

816
01:30:21,829 --> 01:30:23,194
What did he say?

817
01:30:23,497 --> 01:30:25,226
They want us to surrender.

818
01:30:25,499 --> 01:30:27,524
"Surrender or be killed," he says.

819
01:30:27,801 --> 01:30:28,859
Us?

820
01:30:29,403 --> 01:30:32,668
Tell him to go take a flying leap
at a rolling doughnut.

821
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:05,900
The Major thinks General McAuliffe
must have misunderstood.

822
01:31:05,973 --> 01:31:08,373
We've appealed
to the well-known American humanity...

823
01:31:08,442 --> 01:31:11,343
to save the people of Bastogne
from further suffering.

824
01:31:11,411 --> 01:31:15,939
We have given you two hours to consider
before raining destruction upon you.

825
01:31:16,083 --> 01:31:19,075
We do not understand
General McAuliffe's answer.

826
01:31:19,453 --> 01:31:22,820
I'll be glad to repeat it.
The answer is, "Nuts!"

827
01:31:33,901 --> 01:31:36,802
Is that a negative or an affirmative reply?

828
01:31:36,870 --> 01:31:39,031
"Nuts" is strictly negative.

829
01:31:46,446 --> 01:31:48,607
We will kill many Americans.

830
01:31:52,553 --> 01:31:54,180
On your way, bud.

831
01:32:21,982 --> 01:32:25,110
I feel better. For once we know
what's going on around here.

832
01:32:25,185 --> 01:32:26,516
For once we get the story...

833
01:32:26,587 --> 01:32:29,852
before my wife writes it up
and it's the daily news.

834
01:33:14,434 --> 01:33:16,334
Here goes my last butt.

835
01:33:16,703 --> 01:33:19,729
Don't tell me your problems.
Tell the chaplain.

836
01:33:21,675 --> 01:33:23,700
Chaplain. I forgot.

837
01:33:24,578 --> 01:33:26,546
We've got nothing to worry about.

838
01:33:26,613 --> 01:33:30,208
Holy Joe is going to pray for us
at the Christmas services.

839
01:33:34,288 --> 01:33:37,849
"They that wait upon the Lord
shall renew their strength.

840
01:33:38,592 --> 01:33:41,425
"They shall mount up
with wings as eagles."

841
01:33:43,263 --> 01:33:44,890
If the fog lifts.

842
01:33:46,333 --> 01:33:48,824
"They shall run, and not be weary."

843
01:33:49,936 --> 01:33:52,131
Unless they have frozen feet.

844
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:56,034
"And they shall walk, and not faint."

845
01:33:57,010 --> 01:34:00,309
If they don't lose too much blood
before the medics come up.

846
01:34:21,335 --> 01:34:23,803
Another airmail message from the Krauts.

847
01:34:25,172 --> 01:34:28,164
"Merry Christmas, soldier,
and our deepest sympathy.

848
01:34:28,642 --> 01:34:31,372
"It's tough being away from home
at this time of year...

849
01:34:31,445 --> 01:34:34,710
"especially when you're surrounded
and outnumbered 10-to-1.

850
01:34:35,682 --> 01:34:39,379
"Don't you feel your loved ones
worrying about you, praying for you?

851
01:34:39,453 --> 01:34:42,889
"Yes, old boy, praying and hoping
you'll come home again.

852
01:34:43,523 --> 01:34:47,152
"Man, have you thought about it?
What if you don't come back?

853
01:34:47,561 --> 01:34:50,860
"Just remember this:
Where there's a will, there's a way.

854
01:34:51,465 --> 01:34:55,902
"Hot chow and safety are waiting for you
only 300 yards away."

855
01:35:46,119 --> 01:35:47,484
Anybody here from Ohio?

856
01:35:47,554 --> 01:35:49,078
- Buckeye Lake, sir.
- Cincinnati.

857
01:35:49,156 --> 01:35:51,056
- Maple Heights, sir.
- Tippecanoe City, sir.

858
01:35:51,124 --> 01:35:54,218
I'm from Chillicothe.
Any of you men Lutherans?

859
01:35:54,294 --> 01:35:55,955
Here, sir.

860
01:35:56,029 --> 01:35:58,361
- I am, sir.
- My wife is, sir.

861
01:35:59,900 --> 01:36:01,128
So am I.

862
01:36:01,768 --> 01:36:05,898
These services aren't just for Lutherans,
any more than just for men from Ohio.

863
01:36:05,972 --> 01:36:08,065
I merely happen to be in your area.

864
01:36:08,141 --> 01:36:12,510
In other areas, there are other chaplains
of various denominations and religions.

865
01:36:13,113 --> 01:36:15,547
All of us Holy Joes are switch-hitters.

866
01:36:16,783 --> 01:36:19,616
Earlier this month in Holland,
I held Hanukkah services...

867
01:36:19,686 --> 01:36:21,950
for some of the men of the Jewish faith.

868
01:36:22,022 --> 01:36:23,751
How did I do, Levenstein?

869
01:36:23,824 --> 01:36:25,655
Not bad for a beginner, sir.

870
01:36:28,929 --> 01:36:30,419
Now it's nearly Christmas...

871
01:36:30,497 --> 01:36:34,194
and here we are in beautiful Bastogne
enjoying the winter sports.

872
01:36:36,369 --> 01:36:38,530
And the $64 question is:

873
01:36:39,005 --> 01:36:41,030
"Was this trip necessary?"

874
01:36:48,114 --> 01:36:50,082
I'll try to answer that.

875
01:36:50,150 --> 01:36:52,618
But my sermons,
like everything else in the army...

876
01:36:52,686 --> 01:36:54,847
depend on the situation and the terrain.

877
01:36:54,921 --> 01:36:57,788
So I assure you
this is going to be a quickie.

878
01:36:57,858 --> 01:36:59,985
Was this trip necessary?

879
01:37:02,229 --> 01:37:03,924
Let's look at the facts.

880
01:37:04,197 --> 01:37:06,688
Nobody wanted this war but the Nazis.

881
01:37:07,100 --> 01:37:11,196
A great many people tried to deal
with them, and a lot of them are dead.

882
01:37:11,338 --> 01:37:12,703
Millions have died...

883
01:37:12,772 --> 01:37:16,264
for no other reason
except that the Nazis wanted them dead.

884
01:37:16,343 --> 01:37:20,507
So, in the final showdown,
there was nothing left to do except fight.

885
01:37:21,848 --> 01:37:23,873
There's a great lesson in this.

886
01:37:24,251 --> 01:37:27,584
Those of us who've learned it
the hard way aren't going to forget it.

887
01:37:27,654 --> 01:37:32,353
We must never again
let any force dedicated to a super-race...

888
01:37:32,692 --> 01:37:35,388
or a super-idea, or super-anything...

889
01:37:35,829 --> 01:37:38,957
become strong enough
to impose itself upon a free world.

890
01:37:39,766 --> 01:37:42,894
We must be smart enough
and tough enough in the beginning...

891
01:37:42,969 --> 01:37:45,767
to put out the fire
before it starts spreading.

892
01:37:46,640 --> 01:37:49,473
So my answer to the $64 question is:

893
01:37:50,176 --> 01:37:53,202
Yes, this trip was necessary.

894
01:37:54,948 --> 01:37:58,440
As the years go by,
a lot of people are going to forget.

895
01:37:58,618 --> 01:38:00,108
But you won't.

896
01:38:00,287 --> 01:38:02,551
And don't ever let anybody tell you...

897
01:38:02,622 --> 01:38:06,023
you were a sucker
to fight in the war against Fascism.

898
01:38:07,060 --> 01:38:09,790
And now, Jerry permitting, let us pray.

899
01:38:12,899 --> 01:38:15,197
Let us pray for this fog to lift.

900
01:38:16,436 --> 01:38:18,063
Almighty God...

901
01:38:23,777 --> 01:38:27,975
The organist is hitting those bass notes
a little too loud for me to be heard.

902
01:38:28,048 --> 01:38:31,575
So let us each pray in his own way,
to his own God.

903
01:39:13,159 --> 01:39:15,923
When you hear planes, men,
don't bother to look up.

904
01:39:15,996 --> 01:39:17,361
They'll be ours.

905
01:39:17,530 --> 01:39:20,055
Yeah, they'll all be going to Berlin.

906
01:39:23,003 --> 01:39:27,599
Layton, you haven't got
a beat-up, old chocolate bar, have you?

907
01:39:28,008 --> 01:39:30,272
I'm on that new lemonade diet.

908
01:39:30,343 --> 01:39:33,608
Drop another nickel in the jukebox,
will you, chum?

909
01:39:38,251 --> 01:39:40,845
<i>We interrupt this program
with an important announcement.</i>

910
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,889
<i>A careful study of the most
scientific instruments and maps...</i>

911
01:39:43,957 --> 01:39:46,050
<i>lead to the following weather forecast.</i>

912
01:39:46,126 --> 01:39:50,153
<i>Continued cold, more snow,
and no sign of the fog lifting.</i>

913
01:39:50,563 --> 01:39:53,726
<i>And now an old favorite,
which is growing more and more popular...</i>

914
01:39:53,800 --> 01:39:57,292
<i>with the men of the 101st:
I Surrender, Dear.</i>

915
01:40:19,526 --> 01:40:21,926
Krauts walking around down there.
Tanks, too.

916
01:40:21,995 --> 01:40:24,930
What am I supposed to use
for ammunition? Spitballs?

917
01:40:24,998 --> 01:40:27,057
We've got 10 rounds left for Old Betsy.

918
01:40:27,133 --> 01:40:30,660
- What about the tank at the roadblock?
- Can't move up. They're out of gas.

919
01:40:30,737 --> 01:40:32,534
Try and get some news on that radio.

920
01:40:32,605 --> 01:40:36,666
Krauts have got it jammed up,
everything except their own wavelength.

921
01:40:36,776 --> 01:40:38,243
I'll try again.

922
01:40:41,915 --> 01:40:43,405
They ain't even dug in.

923
01:40:43,483 --> 01:40:44,848
- Holley.
- What?

924
01:40:45,185 --> 01:40:48,382
Is there anything to those stories
about Krauts shooting prisoners?

925
01:40:48,455 --> 01:40:51,754
- Where'd you get that?
- It's going around.

926
01:40:52,125 --> 01:40:55,583
I heard that if you've got a Kraut pistol
on you when you're captured...

927
01:40:55,662 --> 01:40:57,254
they blow your brains out with it.

928
01:40:57,330 --> 01:40:59,491
Don't fall for them rumors, Layton.

929
01:41:01,301 --> 01:41:04,464
Anybody want a Luger?
It's worth $100 in Paris.

930
01:41:05,872 --> 01:41:07,339
Thanks a lot.

931
01:41:07,974 --> 01:41:11,876
It's a violation of the Sullivan Act
for a civilian to carry firearms.

932
01:41:26,760 --> 01:41:29,786
If I was you, Lieutenant,
I'd hightail it out of here.

933
01:41:31,131 --> 01:41:33,224
Other side of the hill! Dig in!

934
01:41:59,125 --> 01:42:02,424
A careful study of the most
scientific instruments and maps...

935
01:42:02,495 --> 01:42:06,226
leads me to believe
that German bombers are over Bastogne...

936
01:42:06,399 --> 01:42:07,889
fog or no fog.

937
01:42:10,136 --> 01:42:12,764
Kind of rough on rear echelon tonight.

938
01:42:13,239 --> 01:42:14,706
Yeah, I've been thinking...

939
01:42:14,774 --> 01:42:16,969
the Mess Sergeant, the Supply Sergeant...

940
01:42:17,043 --> 01:42:20,171
the pill roller who gives us those shots
with a square needle...

941
01:42:20,246 --> 01:42:22,111
I'm bleeding for them.

942
01:42:43,937 --> 01:42:45,598
<i>... let me avoid death...</i>

943
01:42:45,672 --> 01:42:47,503
<i>let me have forgiveness...</i>

944
01:42:47,574 --> 01:42:49,303
<i>the eternal farewell.</i>

945
01:43:38,625 --> 01:43:40,786
Fall out in and draw a rifle!

946
01:43:40,860 --> 01:43:43,488
- A rifle?
- They just made you a rifleman. Me, too.

947
01:43:45,198 --> 01:43:48,531
The medics told me I wasn't supposed
to go up anymore. You can check.

948
01:43:48,601 --> 01:43:50,228
Get your blanket.

949
01:44:02,815 --> 01:44:05,682
Fall out. Draw rifles and ammo right now!

950
01:44:07,887 --> 01:44:09,912
- Chow?
- You ain't even warm.

951
01:44:09,989 --> 01:44:12,514
Follow me, all of you, on the double!

952
01:44:19,098 --> 01:44:20,588
That's all, brother.

953
01:44:21,834 --> 01:44:24,064
Hey, you! Front and center!

954
01:44:27,507 --> 01:44:31,637
Good thing they didn't send me up.
I never even fired an M-1 rifle.

955
01:44:31,711 --> 01:44:35,306
Last time I was out on the range,
they were still using the.03.

956
01:44:36,249 --> 01:44:39,218
All litter cases will prepare
to be evacuated immediately...

957
01:44:39,285 --> 01:44:40,616
to air raid shelters.

958
01:44:40,687 --> 01:44:43,918
All walking wounded
will fall out and draw rifles.

959
01:45:15,221 --> 01:45:19,089
This is a.30-caliber, gas-operated,
clip-fed, semiautomatic rifle.

960
01:45:19,158 --> 01:45:22,685
Look, you ain't selling it to me.
You're only showing me how it works.

961
01:45:22,762 --> 01:45:26,721
To load it, you just pull the bolt back
like this, and stick the clip in.

962
01:45:35,174 --> 01:45:38,337
- What's up, Smitty?
- Battalion says to pull back.

963
01:45:39,212 --> 01:45:42,306
- Go ahead.
- You, too, sir. They said to tell you.

964
01:46:05,104 --> 01:46:07,664
It's a cinch we ain't pulling back that way.

965
01:46:13,146 --> 01:46:16,081
I guess maybe we ain't pulling back at all.

966
01:46:16,783 --> 01:46:18,910
Lieutenant, take the second squad.

967
01:46:19,052 --> 01:46:22,419
First squad! Third squad! Over here.

968
01:46:46,946 --> 01:46:48,538
Save it, Layton.

969
01:46:48,714 --> 01:46:52,275
They'll be getting a lot closer,
and we'll still be here.

970
01:47:52,478 --> 01:47:53,968
It's shining!

971
01:48:15,501 --> 01:48:17,025
How have you been?

972
01:48:23,543 --> 01:48:27,639
Jarvess, look at them! They got here!

973
01:48:39,926 --> 01:48:42,394
Drive them out of there! Blast them!

974
01:48:47,433 --> 01:48:49,230
C-47s!

975
01:49:07,286 --> 01:49:08,776
What was that about eagles?

976
01:49:08,854 --> 01:49:11,322
"They shall mount up
with wings as eagles.

977
01:49:22,602 --> 01:49:24,502
"They shall run and not be weary."

978
01:49:24,570 --> 01:49:27,368
- Well, what are we waiting for?
- Let's go!

979
01:50:18,190 --> 01:50:21,648
- Save me a couple of drops for my lighter.
- Lighter?

980
01:50:21,927 --> 01:50:24,953
I got a little old lamp I got to fill
back in Bastogne.

981
01:50:42,515 --> 01:50:43,846
K rations.

982
01:50:44,950 --> 01:50:46,349
All dinners.

983
01:50:53,326 --> 01:50:55,260
Hey, fellows, here it is.

984
01:50:57,363 --> 01:50:59,729
Hey, fellows, come and get it.

985
01:51:11,944 --> 01:51:13,536
Here, take your watch.

986
01:52:33,125 --> 01:52:35,559
Daddy, what are them things?

987
01:52:37,229 --> 01:52:40,721
It's a new kind of warfare, son.
Mechanized, I think they call it.

988
01:52:40,800 --> 01:52:43,064
<i>Read about it in the Stars and Stripes.</i>

989
01:52:43,135 --> 01:52:45,365
What will they think of next?

990
01:52:46,105 --> 01:52:49,131
Tank job, cigarette for papa?

991
01:52:52,244 --> 01:52:54,212
<i>Got a Stars and Stripes?</i>

992
01:52:56,382 --> 01:52:59,545
It's two days old.
Heard it's been pretty rugged up here.

993
01:53:01,687 --> 01:53:04,713
That's for sure. That's for dang sure.

994
01:53:07,993 --> 01:53:09,483
Hey, handsome.

995
01:53:11,964 --> 01:53:13,295
Good luck!

996
01:53:20,306 --> 01:53:23,332
The folks back home
knew we'd get out of this.

997
01:53:23,676 --> 01:53:26,975
They heard relief was breaking through
two days ago.

998
01:53:27,379 --> 01:53:30,348
Fine. I'd hate to think
they'd been worrying.

999
01:53:32,184 --> 01:53:35,551
You'll be happy to know we're in Belgium,
not Luxembourg.

1000
01:53:36,522 --> 01:53:39,582
Just so we're going back.
That's all that counts.

1001
01:53:39,658 --> 01:53:42,183
You mean you're not happy in the service?

1002
01:53:42,261 --> 01:53:44,752
I didn't say that. I love it.

1003
01:53:45,231 --> 01:53:47,062
You found a home in the Army, chum.

1004
01:53:47,132 --> 01:53:49,896
Me, too. Never had it so good in my life.

1005
01:54:29,275 --> 01:54:32,711
Third platoon, on your feet.

1006
01:54:36,348 --> 01:54:37,576
Fall in.

1007
01:54:39,451 --> 01:54:41,681
Oh, no!

1008
01:55:17,423 --> 01:55:19,618
About face.

1009
01:55:33,639 --> 01:55:35,664
Forward march.

1010
01:55:57,363 --> 01:55:59,388
Whatever happened to Jody?

1011
01:56:09,942 --> 01:56:11,671
All right. Come on.

1012
01:56:11,777 --> 01:56:14,712
What do you want these guys to think,
you're a bunch of WACs?

1013
01:56:14,780 --> 01:56:18,181
All right. Pick it up. Hut, two, three.

1014
01:58:30,182 --> 01:58:31,171
English
