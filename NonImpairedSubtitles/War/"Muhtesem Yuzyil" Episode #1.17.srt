Episode 17

3
00:00:21,115 --> 00:00:23,115
My Hatice

4
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:25,094
Hürrem, welcome

5
00:00:34,674 --> 00:00:36,674
What are you talking about?

6
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,018
How will you take Hürrem's life?

7
00:00:39,591 --> 00:00:41,591
As long as you want it my Sultana

8
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:43,064
I will find a way

9
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,128
Don't interfere in things you can't do

10
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:50,021
I don't want it

11
00:00:50,064 --> 00:00:52,064
Do you understand?

12
00:00:52,076 --> 00:00:52,142
My Sultana...

13
00:00:53,042 --> 00:00:54,816
Enough, shut up!

14
00:00:59,003 --> 00:01:01,003
My pain is enough for me

15
00:01:04,054 --> 00:01:06,055
I don't want you to cause me more troubles

16
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:16,087
I hope it is good

17
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:20,155
Very good news, my Majesty

18
00:01:23,013 --> 00:01:25,015
I wanted to tell you the good news myself

19
00:01:29,015 --> 00:01:31,015
I'm pregnant again

20
00:01:31,043 --> 00:01:33,043
Prince is on the way

21
00:01:46,004 --> 00:01:48,004
My Hürrem

22
00:01:48,004 --> 00:01:51,072
You make me happy, I hope God will make you too

23
00:01:57,016 --> 00:01:59,016
Alexandra

24
00:02:02,001 --> 00:02:07,055
Don't forget to subscribe to our youtube channel :)

25
00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:02,094
Leo, Leo!

26
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:04,093
Do you wish to die, man?

27
00:04:11,003 --> 00:04:13,007
My Majesty, please accept my congratulations

28
00:04:14,078 --> 00:04:15,081
Thanks, İbrahim

29
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:19,045
I hope God will grant you and Hatice fortunate children too

30
00:04:23,002 --> 00:04:25,003
I hope God will grant us a son

31
00:04:25,004 --> 00:04:26,799
I hope so, Hürrem

32
00:04:28,052 --> 00:04:31,054
Daye, keep an eye on Mahidevran

33
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:33,084
She should be miserable now

34
00:04:33,084 --> 00:04:34,136
She shouldn't do anything mad

35
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:36,043
Don't you worry my Sultana

36
00:04:37,053 --> 00:04:39,053
I'll take care of it

37
00:04:46,595 --> 00:04:48,595
My Sultana

38
00:04:49,004 --> 00:04:52,032
Forgive me,  I'd like to tell you something

39
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:55,172
Did something happen? What is it? Tell me

40
00:05:03,016 --> 00:05:05,016
My Sultana...

41
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:07,028
I'm very sad

42
00:05:07,053 --> 00:05:09,053
You are a supreme Sultana

43
00:05:10,064 --> 00:05:12,086
It is very hard to be leaving your service

44
00:05:13,045 --> 00:05:15,045
Thanks to you

45
00:05:15,045 --> 00:05:16,093
Don't be sad, Sadıka

46
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:17,168
I'm glad to have you

47
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,086
I'm very glad of your respect and care

48
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:25,045
But I'm also happy that you are going with Hatice Sultana

49
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:27,011
I won't have to be worried

50
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:30,009
I'm sure you'll serve my Hatice well too

51
00:05:36,024 --> 00:05:38,048
My Majesty, should they be waiting for the painting?

52
00:05:38,048 --> 00:05:40,062
No, they can come later

53
00:05:46,016 --> 00:05:48,016
Who are they?

54
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:51,021
Ibrahim met a talented artist. He wants me to be portraited

55
00:05:52,028 --> 00:05:54,028
He'll hang it in his palace

56
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:58,233
How nice

57
00:05:59,043 --> 00:06:01,117
Perhaps he can paint us together, can't he?

58
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:06,004
Let's see

59
00:06:06,004 --> 00:06:08,004
How will he paint my portrait

60
00:06:08,004 --> 00:06:09,040
Let's see it first

61
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:16,036
My Majesty is busy with his harem

62
00:06:16,036 --> 00:06:18,036
Leave now, you'll come later

63
00:06:19,065 --> 00:06:21,079
What happened to you? You are pale

64
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:26,012
I worked hard last night

65
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:27,927
I didn't sleep

66
00:06:28,035 --> 00:06:30,020
Okay then, go get some rest

67
00:06:30,002 --> 00:06:31,076
Come on Matrakçı

68
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:34,007
Pack your stuff

69
00:06:44,934 --> 00:06:46,934
Who are these women?

70
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:49,081
They came the day before

71
00:06:49,081 --> 00:06:50,815
One of them is Hatice Sultana

72
00:06:51,055 --> 00:06:55,072
She's the sister of our Majesty and future wife of Our İbrahim Paşa

73
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:57,894
The other one is Hürrem Sultana

74
00:06:57,894 --> 00:06:58,948
Hürrem?

75
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:01,043
Oh she's from your country. She's from Crimea

76
00:07:01,043 --> 00:07:03,043
She's daughter of a priest

77
00:07:03,004 --> 00:07:05,098
And now she's the woman of supreme Sultan Süleyman

78
00:07:06,062 --> 00:07:08,062
Beared him two children

79
00:07:08,062 --> 00:07:09,134
The third one is on the way

80
00:07:13,088 --> 00:07:15,184
I can't wait anymore. I can't sleep anymore

81
00:07:16,084 --> 00:07:18,086
Easy, they'll hear us

82
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,233
Not much left to rejoin

83
00:07:22,374 --> 00:07:24,374
Our wedding will be magnificent my Sultana

84
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:08,078
The day you've been waiting for's arrived, my Sultana

85
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:11,045
The day you've been dreaming of

86
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:16,133
See,

87
00:08:17,033 --> 00:08:18,968
What they are doing for you

88
00:08:20,028 --> 00:08:22,028
All the city is entertaining

89
00:08:40,028 --> 00:08:42,053
My lion cub, you want to come too ?

90
00:08:42,053 --> 00:08:43,778
Yes, father

91
00:08:44,264 --> 00:08:46,270
I get very bored among women

92
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:49,035
Don't ever say it near women

93
00:08:50,076 --> 00:08:52,077
It is evening, the party has started

94
00:08:53,014 --> 00:08:55,038
İbrahim promised to take me

95
00:08:55,072 --> 00:08:58,120
Okay my Mustafa, I just have a little work left. Let me finish and we'll go

96
00:09:15,999 --> 00:09:17,024
This meeting is like a gift for me

97
00:09:18,999 --> 00:09:20,999
I didn't think I'd see you

98
00:09:20,063 --> 00:09:24,075
I couldn't go without seeing you the last time, without kissing your blessed hands

99
00:09:26,057 --> 00:09:28,057
I'll leave this palace in a while

100
00:09:29,096 --> 00:09:31,168
But this seperation will be the last parting

101
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,121
I'll be watching our wedding from a distance

102
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,009
I'll loko at you afar

103
00:09:40,057 --> 00:09:42,057
You won't be able to see me

104
00:09:43,673 --> 00:09:45,673
But please feel me

105
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:48,042
I'll always be near you

106
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:49,114
You should know too,

107
00:09:50,014 --> 00:09:54,036
That I won't be breathing until the night we lay our head on the same pillow

108
00:09:58,052 --> 00:10:00,052
Listen to my heart

109
00:10:00,052 --> 00:10:01,148
Hear it

110
00:10:12,015 --> 00:10:14,015
It is beating for me

111
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
It says...

112
00:10:17,004 --> 00:10:19,004
... the happiness is here

113
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,083
It is very soon

114
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:38,001
I need to go, my Sultana

115
00:10:39,004 --> 00:10:41,030
Paşas are waiting for me at the first court

116
00:10:44,097 --> 00:10:46,097
Farewell

117
00:10:47,933 --> 00:10:49,933
My love

118
00:10:49,933 --> 00:10:51,500
My soul

119
00:10:59,875 --> 00:11:01,875
Farewell, my love

120
00:11:13,035 --> 00:11:15,035
Paşa his Lordship

121
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:16,994
Farewell to you

122
00:11:17,032 --> 00:11:19,035
I hope you'll be happy forever

123
00:11:20,004 --> 00:11:22,005
May God bless you, Nigar Kalfa

124
00:11:50,015 --> 00:11:52,015
What a talent

125
00:11:52,097 --> 00:11:55,159
Welcome, sirrah. Welcome

126
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:57,480
I'm honored Master Nasuh

127
00:11:58,008 --> 00:12:03,014
Thank you, I'm praying to God that I'm seeing this happy day

128
00:12:03,087 --> 00:12:06,163
It is the single ones' turn now

129
00:12:12,008 --> 00:12:13,014
What?

130
00:12:13,014 --> 00:12:15,076
Don't look at me like that. I'm fine like this

131
00:12:16,006 --> 00:12:22,008
I thought I was fine too but then I fell in the fire of a sea (blue) eyed beauty

132
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:25,129
Long live our Emperor

133
00:12:26,003 --> 00:12:27,557
They are comming

134
00:12:28,014 --> 00:12:36,087
Long live our Emperor, long live Our Emperor, long live our Emperor

135
00:13:01,975 --> 00:13:03,983
Şehzade Mustafa, Nazar değmesin kaşa

136
00:13:04,005 --> 00:13:05,014
Prince Mustafa, God save you

137
00:13:06,005 --> 00:13:08,005
Do you see Mustafa? They love you very much

138
00:13:08,005 --> 00:13:09,077
I love them very much too

139
00:13:10,254 --> 00:13:12,254
Prince Mustafa, God save you

140
00:14:29,254 --> 00:14:31,254
Attention

141
00:14:31,254 --> 00:14:33,293
Sultan Süleyman Khan His Excellence

142
00:14:49,063 --> 00:14:51,063
My emperor

143
00:14:51,063 --> 00:14:54,096
We have reached this supreme honor because of you

144
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:58,024
You are at my son İbrahim's wedding

145
00:14:58,076 --> 00:15:01,110
How can we tell our happiness with my son Niko...

146
00:15:02,066 --> 00:15:04,072
I'm very glad, welcome

147
00:15:05,008 --> 00:15:07,008
Are you happy with your family?

148
00:15:09,774 --> 00:15:11,774
My Emperor

149
00:15:12,097 --> 00:15:14,097
How can I say this...

150
00:15:15,775 --> 00:15:17,775
We are fishermen

151
00:15:17,087 --> 00:15:19,087
Forgive us if there is a mistake,

152
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:20,161
Our prayers are for you,

153
00:15:21,062 --> 00:15:22,124
For your family

154
00:15:31,081 --> 00:15:33,115
When I look at you I want to call you "Pargalı"

155
00:15:35,094 --> 00:15:39,140
Having a twin brother is a grace of Allah, appreciate it

156
00:15:42,096 --> 00:15:44,110
Your brother is very important to me

157
00:16:22,038 --> 00:16:23,042
My Majesty

158
00:16:23,042 --> 00:16:25,110
We have been neglecting the painting since a while

159
00:16:26,083 --> 00:16:28,083
But we will continue after the wedding

160
00:16:30,048 --> 00:16:32,048
You'll paint me more portraits

161
00:16:33,062 --> 00:16:35,062
As you wish my Majesty

162
00:16:36,035 --> 00:16:38,035
Are you done with your works here?

163
00:16:38,035 --> 00:16:39,978
Only a little left, my Majesty

164
00:16:40,335 --> 00:16:42,335
Good

165
00:17:07,096 --> 00:17:09,096
Hürrem?

166
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,135
Don't be afraid

167
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:14,072
It was a little pain

168
00:17:17,096 --> 00:17:19,096
Baby just poked me

169
00:17:30,153 --> 00:17:32,153
It is nothing

170
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:46,023
What's this face?

171
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,032
You're the Sultana's bridemaid

172
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,748
You should be working like a bee, don't stop

173
00:17:51,096 --> 00:17:53,097
I'll be leaving the palace, I'm very sad

174
00:17:54,097 --> 00:17:56,185
I would be favourite and bear princes as Hürrem Hatun

175
00:17:57,086 --> 00:17:58,162
Don't think about these anymore

176
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:01,084
There's no good in being rebellious against fate

177
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
I'll not see Majesty again

178
00:18:05,003 --> 00:18:06,051
Who said that?

179
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,628
You'll see him

180
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:10,087
Our İbrahim Paşa is the closest one to our Majesty

181
00:18:11,054 --> 00:18:13,054
He'll be going to his palace

182
00:18:13,056 --> 00:18:15,056
Will he be?

183
00:18:16,036 --> 00:18:18,036
He would but...

184
00:18:19,008 --> 00:18:21,008
Don't you daydream

185
00:18:22,008 --> 00:18:24,008
Mind your business now

186
00:19:16,657 --> 00:19:18,657
What is it? Are you okay?

187
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,279
My son never stops

188
00:19:20,028 --> 00:19:21,982
He's kicking a lot

189
00:19:25,044 --> 00:19:27,046
It gave a hard time to the mother last night too

190
00:19:28,096 --> 00:19:30,142
A prince worthy of world is comming Iguess

191
00:19:33,066 --> 00:19:35,071
Come on, it is a big day

192
00:19:37,054 --> 00:19:39,054
Bridal procession will start

193
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:44,076
How many days has it been?

194
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:45,913
When will the wedding end?

195
00:19:46,596 --> 00:19:48,059
Are you bored of the wedding?

196
00:19:48,006 --> 00:19:49,034
No

197
00:19:50,086 --> 00:19:51,162
But I don't get to see you

198
00:19:52,061 --> 00:19:53,655
That's enough

199
00:19:54,213 --> 00:19:56,099
Be near me

200
00:19:59,454 --> 00:20:01,454
Süleyman, you are leaving again

201
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:13,001
It is very beautiful, is not it?

202
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:20,144
Will my Hatice like it? What do you think?

203
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,112
You can gift it to me if she doesn't like

204
00:20:26,077 --> 00:20:28,078
I'm in love with that necklace

205
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:32,062
You are my the most precious jewellery

206
00:20:48,008 --> 00:20:50,066
My Hatice, my Janoesque daughter

207
00:20:51,999 --> 00:20:53,999
You're married now

208
00:20:53,016 --> 00:20:56,023
You are married to the Grand Vizier İbrahim Paşa now

209
00:20:57,066 --> 00:20:59,124
May God make you happy for all life long

210
00:21:21,064 --> 00:21:23,064
My mother...

211
00:21:24,061 --> 00:21:26,061
It's my last day at my home today

212
00:21:28,006 --> 00:21:30,057
Please don't deprive me from your caressing laps

213
00:21:39,914 --> 00:21:41,914
Attention

214
00:21:42,278 --> 00:21:44,335
Sultan Süleyman Khan His Excellence

215
00:22:12,296 --> 00:22:14,296
My Hatice

216
00:22:14,086 --> 00:22:16,086
My precious sister

217
00:22:19,355 --> 00:22:21,355
I made a promise to you

218
00:22:21,036 --> 00:22:23,057
Today is the day I'm keeping my promise

219
00:22:50,041 --> 00:22:53,041
Seeing your happiness fills my heart with joy

220
00:22:55,217 --> 00:22:57,217
My Majesty

221
00:22:59,999 --> 00:23:01,999
As long as I breathe...

222
00:23:01,051 --> 00:23:03,083
...I'll not take this necklace off

223
00:23:19,031 --> 00:23:36,089
I've solemnized your marriage with Sultan Süleyman's sister ,Hatice Sultana, in the presence of groomsman, Ayaz Paşa and  our Hatice Sultana's assignee, Mustafa Paşa

224
00:23:36,009 --> 00:23:38,017
May Allah make you happy forever

225
00:23:38,097 --> 00:23:40,097
I hope it will be blessed

226
00:24:02,003 --> 00:24:04,067
It if not worthy of you but...

227
00:24:04,071 --> 00:24:06,071
I'll be happy if you accept 

228
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:10,093
Perhaps you'll go fishing again

229
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:13,868
And your wires will need a repair

230
00:24:14,003 --> 00:24:16,003
You'd remember me

231
00:24:16,003 --> 00:24:17,367
Father...

232
00:24:20,071 --> 00:24:22,071
Father

233
00:24:22,084 --> 00:24:27,140
Your presence, you being near me is the biggest happiness for me

234
00:24:35,054 --> 00:24:37,054
This...

235
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:41,004
This will always make me feel who I really am

236
00:24:41,074 --> 00:24:45,090
I'll always keep it with me with honor. It will be my luck

237
00:25:44,094 --> 00:25:46,094
It has been 9 days

238
00:25:46,094 --> 00:25:47,700
How many more days will the wedding last?

239
00:25:47,092 --> 00:25:49,130
It is İbrahim Paşa's call

240
00:25:50,002 --> 00:25:52,078
Only the bridal procession will leave the palace today

241
00:25:53,087 --> 00:25:55,173
Golds are raining to the soil

242
00:25:56,097 --> 00:25:58,152
Thousands of hungry people were fed here

243
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:00,129
God give blessings

244
00:26:01,044 --> 00:26:03,108
You can't splurge the states' golds like that

245
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:06,011
The treasury would be empty

246
00:26:06,011 --> 00:26:09,029
Our emperor would have one more campaign and fulfill the treasury

247
00:26:09,077 --> 00:26:11,129
They can't leave the party and battle

248
00:26:13,018 --> 00:26:15,018
Shut up you shameless'

249
00:26:15,009 --> 00:26:17,010
Was it your father conquering Rhosed and Belgrad?!

250
00:26:18,003 --> 00:26:22,057
You ate and drank. Instead of praying you are gossiping about our Majesty

251
00:26:22,094 --> 00:26:23,875
Look at your belly

252
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:25,940
You are shameless

253
00:26:25,096 --> 00:26:27,096
Where did you grow this belly?

254
00:26:27,096 --> 00:26:28,103
What?!

255
00:26:29,009 --> 00:26:32,022
Are you hearing what you are saying?

256
00:26:33,011 --> 00:26:35,059
Shameless insolent

257
00:26:35,006 --> 00:26:37,006
Accursed

258
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:39,180
Nothing should be given to you

259
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,000
Let me go

260
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:44,594
Impolite!

261
00:27:17,071 --> 00:27:19,071
Gülfem

262
00:27:20,044 --> 00:27:22,044
My legs are shaking

263
00:27:24,061 --> 00:27:26,061
Don't leave me

264
00:27:26,061 --> 00:27:27,835
My Sultana just a little bit left

265
00:27:28,061 --> 00:27:30,061
Your happiness is waiting for you

266
00:27:39,036 --> 00:27:41,036
Ah, what a beautiful day

267
00:27:41,036 --> 00:27:42,043
Everyone is happy and joyful

268
00:27:43,006 --> 00:27:44,062
Is not it, my Sultana?

269
00:27:44,061 --> 00:27:45,378
Hürrem Hatun

270
00:27:45,936 --> 00:27:47,839
It is not what you are really thinking

271
00:27:47,084 --> 00:27:48,086
You are fake

272
00:27:49,003 --> 00:27:50,947
Everyone knows that

273
00:27:50,983 --> 00:27:52,292
You can't trap me

274
00:27:52,292 --> 00:27:54,179
I know you well

275
00:27:57,046 --> 00:28:00,057
Get along well with me, my Sultana. Because it would be for your goodness

276
00:29:23,077 --> 00:29:27,080
Err..Bride.. procession. From where will they be comming?

277
00:29:28,028 --> 00:29:30,036
Look, they'll come from this way

278
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:32,061
They'll be passing through here

279
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,063
Just wait

280
00:29:33,082 --> 00:29:34,126
Okay, thank you

281
00:29:40,056 --> 00:29:42,059
Ottoman hasn't seen such a wedding

282
00:29:42,096 --> 00:29:46,102
Right, but, They are wasting everything we earnt in Rhodes battle

283
00:29:47,056 --> 00:29:49,097
For who? For accepted İbrahim Paşa

284
00:29:51,294 --> 00:29:53,294
Not one day, not even two

285
00:29:53,031 --> 00:29:55,049
Folks are entertained since 9 days

286
00:29:55,008 --> 00:29:57,008
They say it will continue

287
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:12,039
Hürrem, are you okay?

288
00:30:13,034 --> 00:30:14,072
Calm down

289
00:30:14,071 --> 00:30:15,119
It has been like this 

290
00:30:16,001 --> 00:30:17,025
It is alright

291
00:30:19,006 --> 00:30:21,006
There's still time left for my prince's birth

292
00:30:22,191 --> 00:30:24,191
Don't say so

293
00:30:24,026 --> 00:30:26,026
You've been saying the same last time

294
00:30:26,002 --> 00:30:27,054
You were the sad one in the end

295
00:30:27,096 --> 00:30:29,150
I have to. It has to be a son

296
00:30:31,082 --> 00:30:33,082
Mahidevran has a single son

297
00:30:34,097 --> 00:30:36,097
I should have two

298
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:42,006
Gülnihal...

299
00:30:43,034 --> 00:30:45,034
Pray 

300
00:30:52,041 --> 00:30:54,083
I wish you happiness İbrahim Paşa

301
00:30:56,008 --> 00:30:58,076
I wanted to introduce you wedding gift today, but

302
00:30:58,008 --> 00:31:00,008
The ship comming from Venice is late

303
00:31:01,044 --> 00:31:04,076
Also, I'd like to say you the congratulations wishes of Venice Doge

304
00:31:05,026 --> 00:31:07,026
Thank you 

305
00:31:07,026 --> 00:31:08,108
Also thank you for your gift too

306
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:10,461
I'm ashamed

307
00:31:10,064 --> 00:31:13,160
In a few days your dinner set will be arriving

308
00:31:14,994 --> 00:31:16,994
Enjoy your dinner set

309
00:31:17,013 --> 00:31:19,111
I'd like to have friendship dinners with you on that table

310
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,006
Attention

311
00:31:24,006 --> 00:31:26,014
Sultan Süleyman Khan His Excellence

312
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:39,066
My Majesty

313
00:31:40,084 --> 00:31:42,096
What does Venetian ask for again?

314
00:31:43,009 --> 00:31:46,057
He could ask for inappropriate things in your happy wedding day

315
00:31:48,001 --> 00:31:50,001
They's here for congratulating, my Majesty

316
00:31:50,006 --> 00:31:52,019
They handed me the Venetian Doge's congratulation letter

317
00:31:53,006 --> 00:31:54,044
Good

318
00:32:21,034 --> 00:32:23,034
Wish you always wear it in good days

319
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:29,067
My Majesty

320
00:32:34,076 --> 00:32:36,076
I'm grateful for your great gift

321
00:33:52,082 --> 00:33:54,082
Alex

322
00:33:55,006 --> 00:33:56,077
Come on, come

323
00:33:56,077 --> 00:33:57,149
Where are you my love?

324
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:07,029
Hatice Sultana is very fortunate

325
00:34:08,094 --> 00:34:10,146
She's marrying with such a wedding

326
00:34:14,038 --> 00:34:16,059
I'll never experience something like this

327
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,038
But my daughter Mihrimah will

328
00:34:24,038 --> 00:34:27,126
İbrahim and Mahidevran won't be in the palace

329
00:34:30,076 --> 00:34:32,076
They'll dissapear

330
00:34:43,041 --> 00:34:45,041
The prince is comming!

331
00:34:46,054 --> 00:34:48,130
Stop thecarriage. My Sultana is giving a birth

332
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:16,016
Sultan Süleyman Khan His Excellence

333
00:35:16,027 --> 00:35:19,059
I'm honored to be at this beautiful wedding for Venetian Republic

334
00:35:19,092 --> 00:35:21,094
Please accept our congratulations

335
00:35:29,003 --> 00:35:32,021
This clock is specially made for you ordered by the Venetian Doge

336
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:35,083
The time will be passing through your ears when you look at it

337
00:35:43,025 --> 00:35:45,025
Deliver my thanks to him

338
00:35:46,307 --> 00:35:48,335
But I can't waste time by looking at it

339
00:35:49,001 --> 00:35:51,009
I'd like to be running before the time

340
00:36:49,061 --> 00:36:51,061
Hold on Hürrem

341
00:36:51,061 --> 00:36:53,079
Is not there anybody? Call the physician

342
00:36:53,007 --> 00:36:54,055
Where's the midwife?!

343
00:36:55,027 --> 00:36:56,755
Hürrem, hold on. 

344
00:36:57,003 --> 00:36:59,003
Is there anybody?

345
00:37:24,032 --> 00:37:26,032
Hatice, come near me

346
00:37:28,034 --> 00:37:30,034
Beyhan, Gülfem

347
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:32,813
Mahidevran, you too

348
00:37:44,003 --> 00:37:46,003
Where's Hürrem, Daye?

349
00:37:47,012 --> 00:37:49,012
She was right behind us, my Sultana

350
00:37:51,003 --> 00:37:53,003
Nigar Kalfa?

351
00:37:54,009 --> 00:37:56,036
I didn't see her, I don't know

352
00:38:01,027 --> 00:38:03,051
They must be stuck in the crowd

353
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:05,072
Take care of them

354
00:38:12,054 --> 00:38:14,057
Hürrem Sultan's carriage went back to the palace

355
00:38:15,061 --> 00:38:16,150
How can it be? Who told you that?

356
00:38:19,253 --> 00:38:21,253
I have nothing to do with it

357
00:38:23,057 --> 00:38:25,101
Nigar Kalfa, have a look immediately

358
00:38:26,005 --> 00:38:28,057
Find out what happened urgently and inform me

359
00:38:36,005 --> 00:38:39,023
I've called the midwife Hürrem, hold on. She's comming

360
00:38:40,088 --> 00:38:41,132
Help me 

361
00:38:43,385 --> 00:38:45,385
Keep breathing, she'll be here

362
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:48,018
Süleyman, where are you?

363
00:38:50,063 --> 00:38:52,063
There is nobody

364
00:39:06,853 --> 00:39:08,853
My Majesty

365
00:39:09,077 --> 00:39:11,086
Accept my thankfullness for this magnificent wedding

366
00:39:13,057 --> 00:39:15,103
Pargalı, You've been waiting for this happiness

367
00:39:17,025 --> 00:39:19,027
On one side, my the most precious treasure Hatice

368
00:39:20,018 --> 00:39:23,072
On the other side, my bosom friend who saved my life many times

369
00:39:24,041 --> 00:39:26,041
It is not even enough

370
00:39:30,047 --> 00:39:32,047
Dad

371
00:39:32,005 --> 00:39:34,005
I haven't seen Mehmet. He's not here yet

372
00:39:34,007 --> 00:39:36,007
How come?

373
00:39:36,007 --> 00:39:37,070
Sümbül!

374
00:39:38,034 --> 00:39:39,657
My Majesty

375
00:39:41,014 --> 00:39:43,014
Why didn't Hürrem Hatun come here?

376
00:39:43,016 --> 00:39:46,030
I'll get an information immediately my Majesty, don't you worry

377
00:40:01,074 --> 00:40:02,150
My Valide Sultana

378
00:40:03,005 --> 00:40:07,061
Wagoner just came,  her labor's started. Therefore they had to go back

379
00:40:09,021 --> 00:40:12,069
Have her taken care of right now, She shouldn't be alone

380
00:40:12,007 --> 00:40:14,043
Nigar Kalfa went there, she'll be taking care of the situation, my Sultana

381
00:40:17,454 --> 00:40:19,454
God, you are merciful, help us

382
00:40:20,003 --> 00:40:22,003
She shall bear a girl

383
00:40:22,097 --> 00:40:24,145
I hope she'll die during the labor!

384
00:40:26,052 --> 00:40:28,074
My Sultanas tears may have an end

385
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:36,083
Hold on, hold on

386
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,860
Hürrem Sultan?

387
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:44,103
Nigar Kalfa! Noone would know even if I die. Where have you been?!

388
00:40:45,005 --> 00:40:47,006
My Sultana, come on, one last push

389
00:40:47,005 --> 00:40:48,043
Push it, come on

390
00:40:58,077 --> 00:41:00,077
Say it

391
00:41:00,077 --> 00:41:01,172
Tell me

392
00:41:01,875 --> 00:41:03,356
Is it a son?

393
00:41:03,356 --> 00:41:04,760
Gülnihal?

394
00:41:04,076 --> 00:41:06,054
Nigar?

395
00:41:06,076 --> 00:41:08,076
My Sultana, You've beared a lion

396
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,068
Thank you God

397
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:30,547
The beauty with...

398
00:41:31,038 --> 00:41:33,054
...Beautiful eyebrows and and thin waist

399
00:41:35,057 --> 00:41:37,090
May Nasuh be sacrificed for you

400
00:41:50,063 --> 00:41:52,063
Was that you?

401
00:41:52,063 --> 00:41:53,087
You scared me

402
00:41:57,003 --> 00:41:59,038
Move, move, they shouldn't see us

403
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:07,025
Walk, walk

404
00:42:15,057 --> 00:42:16,094
Daye?

405
00:42:16,094 --> 00:42:18,162
Give us a good news at this happy day

406
00:42:21,097 --> 00:42:22,130
Is it over yet?

407
00:42:23,003 --> 00:42:24,021
My Sultana...

408
00:42:24,047 --> 00:42:25,143
We have got one more prince

409
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,000
God, you are great

410
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,034
You've granted me double happiness in a single day

411
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:11,016
Nigar, give me my son

412
00:43:29,074 --> 00:43:30,096
My Sultana

413
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:33,027
You got the prince in the end

414
00:43:34,940 --> 00:43:36,940
You trust me by now

415
00:43:52,057 --> 00:43:54,057
Pargalı

416
00:43:54,057 --> 00:43:56,057
I have one more son 

417
00:43:58,063 --> 00:44:01,139
All my subjects should learn about my prince's good news. Fire the cannons!

418
00:44:04,007 --> 00:44:06,025
My Majesty, our happiness is doubled now

419
00:44:07,032 --> 00:44:09,096
My God bless you and our prince

420
00:44:11,068 --> 00:44:12,104
Thanks, Pargalı

421
00:44:42,021 --> 00:44:44,028
My Sultana, you have fortunated me once again

422
00:44:46,005 --> 00:44:49,031
May God allow you to raise it together and with peace

423
00:44:50,056 --> 00:44:52,056
Wonderful

424
00:44:54,096 --> 00:44:56,096
Thank you my Valide

425
00:44:57,047 --> 00:44:59,113
I hope, Allow will allow you to be with us all the time

426
00:45:16,032 --> 00:45:18,032
İbrahim Paşa will be here in a while

427
00:45:18,032 --> 00:45:19,064
I should go

428
00:45:20,748 --> 00:45:22,748
Don't leave yet, Gülfem

429
00:45:22,748 --> 00:45:24,610
Stay a little bit more

430
00:45:25,056 --> 00:45:27,059
You've been waiting for this moment since a long time

431
00:45:28,023 --> 00:45:30,023
Relax

432
00:45:47,096 --> 00:45:48,172
It is time to...

433
00:45:49,074 --> 00:45:51,077
... make yourself and also the Paşa happy

434
00:46:15,085 --> 00:46:19,173
Our Valide Sultana is inviting you to the naming ceramony of our prince

435
00:46:28,021 --> 00:46:30,021
Will you go?

436
00:46:31,076 --> 00:46:33,076
Is not it a pity for you?

437
00:46:34,001 --> 00:46:36,005
Will you be obligated to go see that woman?

438
00:46:38,083 --> 00:46:40,097
We need to do the traditions in the palace

439
00:46:42,023 --> 00:46:44,097
I need to play the game within it's rules

440
00:46:46,072 --> 00:46:48,072
I'll go, Gülşah

441
00:47:01,043 --> 00:47:03,043
Good night, my Paşa

442
00:47:13,835 --> 00:47:15,835
Gülfem Hatun...

443
00:47:16,094 --> 00:47:18,094
Thank you very much

444
00:47:21,036 --> 00:47:23,039
If we made it to this night, your share in it is big

445
00:47:25,056 --> 00:47:27,056
I can never pay it back

446
00:47:29,016 --> 00:47:31,016
Take good care of our Sultana

447
00:47:31,007 --> 00:47:33,007
Never make her sad

448
00:47:33,081 --> 00:47:34,145
Don't break my heart

449
00:47:35,056 --> 00:47:37,056
Make her happy

450
00:47:37,005 --> 00:47:39,023
You can pay it back only this way

451
00:47:42,246 --> 00:47:44,246
Don't worry at all, Gülfem Hatun

452
00:48:28,007 --> 00:48:31,029
God bless him. I hope he'll grow up healthy, my Majesty

453
00:48:32,027 --> 00:48:33,111
Thank you Mahidevran Sultana

454
00:48:47,012 --> 00:48:49,039
I'll name my Prince my deceased father's name

455
00:48:49,943 --> 00:48:52,977
Shall he be a majestic emperor as Sultan Selim Khan

456
00:48:57,007 --> 00:49:01,012
in the name of Allah, the compassionate, the merciful

457
00:49:19,012 --> 00:49:21,076
Selim.. Selim.. Selim

458
00:49:41,034 --> 00:49:43,110
Selim, Selim, Selim

459
00:50:04,014 --> 00:50:06,017
In the name of Allah, the compassionate, the merciful

460
00:50:07,016 --> 00:50:11,079
(Praying in Arabic)

461
00:50:13,068 --> 00:50:14,153
May God make him righteous

462
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:15,152
Amen

463
00:50:16,052 --> 00:50:18,054
May Allah make him happy

464
00:50:18,054 --> 00:50:18,126
Amen

465
00:50:19,025 --> 00:50:21,077
I hope Allah save him for the Ottoman Empire

466
00:50:23,170 --> 00:50:25,170
Amen

467
00:54:22,001 --> 00:54:25,003
50.000 people attended the wedding of İbrahim Paşa and Hatice Sultana

468
00:54:26,007 --> 00:54:29,071
Never-seen-before entertainments have been organised for 15 days

469
00:54:30,045 --> 00:54:31,119
İstanbul (Constantinopolis) ...

470
00:54:32,001 --> 00:54:34,023
enjoyed in the streets without sleep

471
00:54:36,063 --> 00:54:38,147
İbrahim Paşa is not only The Grand Vizier now

472
00:54:40,018 --> 00:54:42,018
He's a dynasty groom now too

473
00:54:42,018 --> 00:54:43,054
He's got very powerful

474
00:54:43,056 --> 00:54:45,132
The palace opened it's gates for the first time to the people with this wedding

475
00:54:47,092 --> 00:54:49,092
Though people enjoyed the wedding,

476
00:54:49,096 --> 00:54:51,096
On the other side,

477
00:54:51,096 --> 00:54:54,137
The folks had the hump because of the weddings length and the money waster

478
00:54:56,003 --> 00:54:59,081
Especially Sultan Süleyman's Janisaries ( soldiers ) are unhappy with this situation

479
00:55:00,052 --> 00:55:03,128
They believe the money gained from Rhodes campaign is being wasted

480
00:55:05,021 --> 00:55:08,025
During the wedding, Sultan Süleyman got one more son

481
00:55:09,007 --> 00:55:11,052
Born of Russian concubine, Hürrem Sultan

482
00:55:13,012 --> 00:55:15,054
The baby was named Selim

483
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:23,097
Close relations should be built with İbrahim Paşa whose mother is Venetian

484
00:55:24,038 --> 00:55:29,054
A Paşa who speaks our language and know our customs is a golden opportunity

485
00:55:31,014 --> 00:55:36,072
Venetian Embassadors should be close and send gifts

486
00:55:44,041 --> 00:55:44,050
Selim

487
00:55:45,914 --> 00:55:47,580
The precious of his aunt

488
00:55:48,001 --> 00:55:50,010
I'll eat those delicious cheeks of yours

489
00:55:51,023 --> 00:55:52,121
My dear

490
00:55:53,094 --> 00:55:55,094
How sweet you are

491
00:55:57,007 --> 00:55:59,007
It is fortunate you are here

492
00:56:01,003 --> 00:56:04,049
I wanted very much but couldn't be with you at your wedding

493
00:56:06,043 --> 00:56:08,097
If you want it very much, it doesn't get real. I learnt it

494
00:56:10,001 --> 00:56:12,007
How have you been? Are you better now?

495
00:56:14,072 --> 00:56:16,072
I just got up from the bed

496
00:56:17,074 --> 00:56:19,142
I've been bored, laying since days

497
00:56:22,014 --> 00:56:25,038
I want to go to the yard and walk, breath fresh air

498
00:56:26,000 --> 00:56:28,065
It is like we are prisoners in this chamber

499
00:56:36,056 --> 00:56:38,056
How nice

500
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
Who gifted this?

501
00:56:42,003 --> 00:56:44,003
Mahidevran Sultana's gift

502
00:56:45,085 --> 00:56:47,085
How beautiful

503
00:56:47,085 --> 00:56:48,177
You should be like this

504
00:56:49,077 --> 00:56:50,155
Live in peace

505
00:56:51,056 --> 00:56:53,059
I don't want to be worried about you

506
00:56:54,096 --> 00:56:56,096
We've found the peace

507
00:56:59,380 --> 00:57:01,380
But you tell me

508
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:02,960
Are you happy?

509
00:57:03,092 --> 00:57:05,092
Very much

510
00:57:06,034 --> 00:57:08,034
I'm flying with wings

511
00:57:10,023 --> 00:57:12,023
It is like I'm on the clouds

512
00:57:16,009 --> 00:57:18,009
Put your finger down, yeah

513
00:57:19,001 --> 00:57:21,079
You are pulling here, pull, pull it

514
00:57:21,007 --> 00:57:23,023
Look at the target, lock on the target

515
00:57:24,061 --> 00:57:26,061
Leave it when you are ready

516
00:57:27,056 --> 00:57:29,119
Well done, well done. Come on, one more shoot

517
00:57:34,025 --> 00:57:36,111
When you are ready, hold on

518
00:57:37,057 --> 00:57:39,094
Let it go when you are ready

519
00:57:40,677 --> 00:57:41,683
Well done

520
00:57:41,076 --> 00:57:43,101
My Prince, My Majesty

521
00:57:44,001 --> 00:57:45,079
Welcome Pargalı

522
00:57:45,007 --> 00:57:48,085
Mustafa wants to shoot arrows since he saw the archers competiting at your wedding

523
00:57:49,061 --> 00:57:51,061
İbrahim, I'll be the best archer

524
00:57:51,061 --> 00:57:52,884
Don't call him İbrahim.

525
00:57:53,443 --> 00:57:55,440
You are a man now. It is İbrahim Paşa infront of you

526
00:57:55,074 --> 00:57:57,074
Call him İbrahim Paşa or just Paşa

527
00:57:58,003 --> 00:58:00,069
My Majesty, if you allow, whatever our prince call me is accepted

528
00:58:01,027 --> 00:58:03,027
We are close, are not we my Prince?

529
00:58:03,027 --> 00:58:04,905
Yes, we are

530
00:58:05,016 --> 00:58:07,041
When will my sword trainings start, my Paşa?

531
00:58:07,063 --> 00:58:09,099
We'll go to Janissery House next week then

532
00:58:10,295 --> 00:58:13,297
We may visit the Ağa squat that our Majesty is member of

533
00:58:13,315 --> 00:58:15,200
Don't give me wooden sword again

534
00:58:15,023 --> 00:58:18,027
No, Are you a kid? You'll be using steel sword by now

535
00:58:18,092 --> 00:58:22,095
My Majesty, Venetian Embassador will visit today. Will you accept him to your presence?

536
00:58:23,050 --> 00:58:25,050
You accept them, that'd be enough

537
00:58:25,077 --> 00:58:27,105
Ask them if there's a new news from Luther

538
00:58:30,001 --> 00:58:33,043
Additionally, We'd like to host you with my Hatice Sultana tomorrow evening

539
00:58:34,003 --> 00:58:36,003
We'll attend for sure

540
00:58:36,003 --> 00:58:37,097
My Majesty

541
00:58:37,134 --> 00:58:38,815
My Prince, with your permission

542
00:58:40,693 --> 00:58:42,693
Come on

543
00:58:48,025 --> 00:58:51,057
Hold is steedy, Do you see the target? 

544
00:58:54,014 --> 00:58:56,014
Leave it when you are ready

545
00:59:23,043 --> 00:59:25,043
Thanks to you Leo

546
00:59:27,023 --> 00:59:29,023
You are a talented man

547
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:32,041
Thanks, thanks

548
00:59:33,014 --> 00:59:35,014
So, are you done here?

549
00:59:36,005 --> 00:59:39,007
İbrahim Paşa wants more paintings at another room

550
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:41,091
After that, it will be over

551
00:59:42,063 --> 00:59:45,067
Hold there, you'll paint our Sultan's portrait yet

552
00:59:47,005 --> 00:59:49,005
The Sultan is not very enthusiastic

553
00:59:50,057 --> 00:59:52,057
Like he doesn't want it

554
00:59:53,456 --> 00:59:55,534
On the contrary, he wants it a lot

555
01:00:04,043 --> 01:00:06,043
I'm very sorry

556
01:00:06,043 --> 01:00:07,127
I didn't know you were here

557
01:00:09,077 --> 01:00:11,077
Sadıka Hatun

558
01:00:19,527 --> 01:00:21,527
I need to tell you somethng

559
01:00:23,023 --> 01:00:25,023
Is it possible to meet in the yard?

560
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,107
No

561
01:00:28,012 --> 01:00:29,057
It is forbidden

562
01:00:29,057 --> 01:00:30,119
Someone might see

563
01:00:31,001 --> 01:00:32,344
I'd be beheaded

564
01:00:32,543 --> 01:00:35,628
Don't be afraid. It is not Majesty's palace. There's noone to be angry

565
01:00:45,027 --> 01:00:47,027
You get some rest

566
01:00:47,054 --> 01:00:49,108
I'll go, My mother is waiting

567
01:00:51,081 --> 01:00:54,085
Thanks a lot. I'm happy to see you

568
01:01:03,034 --> 01:01:04,036
Mahidevran

569
01:01:04,054 --> 01:01:05,389
My Sultana

570
01:01:05,875 --> 01:01:08,952
I heard you came. I was worried  in case you leave withou seeing me

571
01:01:10,043 --> 01:01:12,043
Firstly I wanted to see our prince

572
01:01:15,036 --> 01:01:18,061
Hatice Sultan loves the gift you gifted

573
01:01:20,016 --> 01:01:22,016
Me too aswell

574
01:01:25,054 --> 01:01:28,101
I haven't seen my mother yet. We can visit together if you like

575
01:01:29,003 --> 01:01:31,003
Of course my, Sultana

576
01:01:43,068 --> 01:01:45,124
Don't be too happy because you have the second prince

577
01:01:48,054 --> 01:01:52,108
The important point is that which prince will be sitting on the throne and become the next Sultan

578
01:02:07,072 --> 01:02:09,072
Victoria. err... no

579
01:02:10,088 --> 01:02:12,088
Sadıka

580
01:02:13,233 --> 01:02:15,233
Sadıka Hatun. Huh!

581
01:02:17,005 --> 01:02:19,005
I.. err.. this

582
01:02:26,949 --> 01:02:28,949
Master Nasuh

583
01:02:30,007 --> 01:02:32,007
I can't be here for too long

584
01:02:32,007 --> 01:02:33,601
What will you tell me ?

585
01:02:40,057 --> 01:02:42,057
Look

586
01:02:44,036 --> 01:02:48,128
I drew this not to forget you, your voice and face

587
01:02:54,025 --> 01:02:56,025
I drew you

588
01:02:59,074 --> 01:03:01,074
Won't you say anything?

589
01:03:06,003 --> 01:03:08,003
I should go

590
01:03:10,063 --> 01:03:11,139
Before you go...

591
01:03:12,003 --> 01:03:14,003
I want you to look at my face just once

592
01:03:15,076 --> 01:03:17,119
Look at me once. For God's sake

593
01:03:19,043 --> 01:03:21,043
Please, sir

594
01:03:21,043 --> 01:03:22,531
Someone can see

595
01:03:37,014 --> 01:03:39,014
My Hatice, my dear daughter

596
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:41,007
Your face is shining

597
01:03:41,007 --> 01:03:42,016
Happiness suits you

598
01:03:44,063 --> 01:03:45,147
Are you glad with Sadıka?

599
01:03:46,047 --> 01:03:47,103
Yes, I'm, mother

600
01:03:48,003 --> 01:03:50,018
As you said, Sadıka is very respectful

601
01:03:50,003 --> 01:03:51,047
Hardworking too

602
01:03:51,074 --> 01:03:54,079
Oh good. It is hard to find someone like her nowadays

603
01:03:57,036 --> 01:03:59,083
We're still not used to your absence

604
01:04:00,001 --> 01:04:01,077
Please visit me every morning

605
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:04,000
Be with me until the evening

606
01:04:05,056 --> 01:04:07,056
My mother...

607
01:04:07,088 --> 01:04:09,135
I'd like to have dinner with my family tomorrow

608
01:04:12,001 --> 01:04:14,001
I wish to be together in the new palace

609
01:04:15,032 --> 01:04:20,034
We want to host Our Majesty, you, Mahidevran, Gülfem, all the beloved ones

610
01:04:20,056 --> 01:04:22,056
We'll gladly join

611
01:04:22,056 --> 01:04:23,137
My Mother?

612
01:04:26,063 --> 01:04:28,063
Of course we will, my Hatice

613
01:04:33,096 --> 01:04:40,161
Paşa, his lordship, I've brought you the congratulation letter of Venice Doge and Pope His Nibs' eternal happiness wishes

614
01:04:46,076 --> 01:04:48,099
Thank you Senior Mocenigo

615
01:04:53,016 --> 01:04:55,070
Will priest Luther's exile punishment continue?

616
01:04:56,065 --> 01:04:58,113
Since Pope hasn't removed amnesty, it will go on

617
01:05:01,014 --> 01:05:03,016
Unwanted man

618
01:05:05,001 --> 01:05:09,007
When you are the unwanted man, there's no turning back

619
01:05:11,003 --> 01:05:15,092
Paşa, his lordship, your wedding gift arrived to the dock today and been sent to your palace

620
01:05:17,018 --> 01:05:18,025
On the other hand,

621
01:05:18,088 --> 01:05:23,153
Some of our merchants have problems with the customs officers. They pillaged our storages

622
01:05:25,012 --> 01:05:27,012
We are desperate get your help

623
01:05:27,012 --> 01:05:28,110
I understand. Thank you

624
01:05:29,057 --> 01:05:31,083
I'll discuss that with Ayaz Paşa

625
01:05:31,083 --> 01:05:32,125
Don't you worry

626
01:05:37,001 --> 01:05:38,059
What else do you want?

627
01:05:38,722 --> 01:05:40,769
Mahidevran Sultana came and gave a gift

628
01:05:43,057 --> 01:05:45,057
Damn her gift

629
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:48,045
She told me not to be happy because it is a boy

630
01:05:49,007 --> 01:05:51,023
Mustafa will become Majesty

631
01:05:54,014 --> 01:05:56,014
See what she's saying me

632
01:05:57,003 --> 01:06:01,003
Don't answer. You reached your goal. Don't care them

633
01:06:02,054 --> 01:06:07,088
I just can't do it. When I see her I go on the rampage. I barely hold myself

634
01:06:09,003 --> 01:06:12,101
She does all these favors to get Süleyman's attention

635
01:06:13,088 --> 01:06:15,088
Her favors are fake

636
01:06:19,074 --> 01:06:21,074
My Sultana

637
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:24,155
Get ready now, Our Majesty is waiting for you in the yard. You are going

638
01:06:31,005 --> 01:06:33,005
Am I going with my Majesty?

639
01:06:38,001 --> 01:06:41,038
Find Gülnihal. She should keep an eye on kids

640
01:06:52,516 --> 01:06:54,516
Welcome, my Sultana

641
01:06:54,516 --> 01:06:56,155
Thank you, Daye Hatun

642
01:06:56,043 --> 01:06:59,087
My mother, if allow me, I wanna go before it is late

643
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:05,083
I'll be waiting 

644
01:07:07,001 --> 01:07:10,003
But, I forgot to say it to Hürrem Hatun

645
01:07:10,003 --> 01:07:13,018
I'll tell her now, don't worry my Valide

646
01:07:14,054 --> 01:07:18,077
You are late my Sultana. Hürrem Hatun left the palace a while ago

647
01:07:19,003 --> 01:07:21,028
Left how? What are you talking about?

648
01:07:21,057 --> 01:07:23,057
She left with our Majesty

649
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:28,001
Where are they going?

650
01:07:56,003 --> 01:07:58,003
Where are we heading, my Majesty?

651
01:07:59,032 --> 01:08:01,038
It is between your beautiful two lips

652
01:08:03,001 --> 01:08:05,007
This carriage is going wherever you want it to go

653
01:08:09,094 --> 01:08:11,094
My heart's Sultan

654
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,081
The land you step on is my paradise

655
01:08:40,006 --> 01:08:42,006
Are you still here?

656
01:08:42,006 --> 01:08:43,007
My Paşa

657
01:08:46,018 --> 01:08:48,018
I waited for you

658
01:08:49,001 --> 01:08:50,038
I need your advice.

659
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,121
What is it?

660
01:08:54,011 --> 01:08:56,011
Couldn't you talk to her?

661
01:08:56,005 --> 01:08:58,009
Thanks to you I did

662
01:08:58,057 --> 01:09:00,057
So? The conclusion?

663
01:09:01,095 --> 01:09:03,095
I talked to her

664
01:09:04,002 --> 01:09:06,058
She escaped from me like a scared gazelle

665
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:12,280
What could she do Matrakçı?

666
01:09:12,280 --> 01:09:14,260
Was she supposed jump on you?

667
01:09:15,037 --> 01:09:17,041
Be patien, be patient

668
01:09:19,011 --> 01:09:21,037
You'll soon get the peace in your home, Matrakçı

669
01:09:23,002 --> 01:09:25,002
I hope so, my Paşa

670
01:09:25,948 --> 01:09:27,948
I hope so

671
01:09:30,057 --> 01:09:33,091
Venetian Embassador would send me a table as a gift. Is it here yet?

672
01:09:34,094 --> 01:09:36,145
I have no clue. But...

673
01:09:37,958 --> 01:09:39,958
Is it good?

674
01:10:01,135 --> 01:10:03,135
What are you doing?

675
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:05,033
I do this since my childhood

676
01:10:08,005 --> 01:10:09,083
My dear mother...

677
01:10:10,028 --> 01:10:11,043
She'd say...

678
01:10:12,057 --> 01:10:14,076
Step on the soil with bare feet

679
01:10:15,032 --> 01:10:17,083
It'll take all the sorrow and pain from you

680
01:10:19,061 --> 01:10:21,064
Soil gives you goodness and joy

681
01:10:23,122 --> 01:10:25,122
Your mother was right

682
01:10:25,015 --> 01:10:27,047
A person can find peace only on the soil

683
01:10:28,054 --> 01:10:31,145
But, I don't know if under soil or on it

684
01:10:46,003 --> 01:10:48,065
She's precious since she gave birth to the second prince

685
01:10:49,006 --> 01:10:50,007
Lucky woman

686
01:10:50,015 --> 01:10:51,069
They do whatever she wants

687
01:10:53,002 --> 01:10:55,016
Reign of Hürrem Hatun has already started

688
01:11:07,028 --> 01:11:09,028
Kalfa!

689
01:11:09,028 --> 01:11:10,592
What are you waiting for ?

690
01:11:10,844 --> 01:11:12,487
Take them

691
01:11:22,082 --> 01:11:25,160
I should hug my grandchildren when Hürrem is not there

692
01:11:27,007 --> 01:11:29,007
I haven't seen them since 2 days

693
01:11:30,002 --> 01:11:32,018
They'd be late my Sultana

694
01:11:33,036 --> 01:11:35,072
Why did they go out? It is never seen before

695
01:11:36,073 --> 01:11:37,097
You'll see

696
01:11:38,007 --> 01:11:41,050
This love to Hürrem will cause a lot of pain to us

697
01:11:59,078 --> 01:12:01,078
My Sultana

698
01:12:02,043 --> 01:12:04,119
İbrahim. Where did this come from?

699
01:12:08,006 --> 01:12:10,030
Mocenigo, Venetian Embassador, sent it

700
01:12:11,009 --> 01:12:12,095
It has chairs

701
01:12:13,078 --> 01:12:15,096
Candlesticks too, made of silver

702
01:12:16,054 --> 01:12:19,068
By now we'll have dinners on this table my Sultana

703
01:13:09,002 --> 01:13:11,014
Very beautiful, look

704
01:13:16,076 --> 01:13:18,076
Like a conversation

705
01:13:19,002 --> 01:13:21,002
These are budgerigars

706
01:13:21,076 --> 01:13:23,141
They are telling their loves to each other

707
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:29,022
They are singing out all their lives without being tired

708
01:13:35,094 --> 01:13:37,094
These birds are yours

709
01:13:43,014 --> 01:13:46,032
I also will never stop my love

710
01:13:50,854 --> 01:13:52,854
My love

711
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:57,055
You'll stop

712
01:14:01,085 --> 01:14:03,085
You will

713
01:14:46,057 --> 01:14:48,057
My Sultana

714
01:14:51,028 --> 01:14:53,061
The Queen of my paradise

715
01:14:55,054 --> 01:14:58,065
I'm fascinated when I look at your beauty

716
01:15:02,007 --> 01:15:04,065
Your words are embarrasing me very much

717
01:15:06,076 --> 01:15:08,108
I hope our paradise will last forever

718
01:15:39,011 --> 01:15:41,011
If you are in love...

719
01:15:41,011 --> 01:15:43,011
Consider yourself as thrown away

720
01:15:46,002 --> 01:15:48,002
If you are the king,

721
01:15:48,021 --> 01:15:50,021
Consider yourself as a slave, subject

722
01:15:50,083 --> 01:15:52,083
Oh Love,

723
01:15:52,083 --> 01:15:54,087
I'm like your cheek, it said

724
01:15:55,025 --> 01:15:58,083
Consider the rose ashamed because of its word

725
01:16:01,002 --> 01:16:03,002
You, fairy

726
01:16:04,003 --> 01:16:09,012
If you wish so, you can see me, the loving one, as in fire

727
01:16:12,078 --> 01:16:14,146
Ey, Muhibbi ( Süleyman's nickname in his poems )

728
01:16:15,054 --> 01:16:18,076
If you want to find the real taste of pure lips, then look at sugar

729
01:16:19,064 --> 01:16:21,128
Don't be proud of the spring of your life

730
01:16:22,055 --> 01:16:25,093
See yourself in the blend as an individual

731
01:16:48,416 --> 01:16:50,416
They are not back yet, my Sultana

732
01:16:50,416 --> 01:16:52,260
It is late, don't wait anymore

733
01:17:40,006 --> 01:17:42,006
My love

734
01:17:42,167 --> 01:17:44,167
My Majesty

735
01:17:45,099 --> 01:17:47,099
My Hürrem

736
01:17:49,047 --> 01:17:51,061
My deep love

737
01:17:54,037 --> 01:17:56,037
It is morning

738
01:17:56,082 --> 01:17:58,082
Shall we go?

739
01:17:59,065 --> 01:18:01,065
My children await me

740
01:18:17,064 --> 01:18:20,110
There's a letter for you from Egypt, from Kadızade Mehmet Efendi, my Paşa

741
01:18:41,097 --> 01:18:43,097
My Paşa, is it a bad news?

742
01:18:45,032 --> 01:18:49,074
Kadızade states that Ahmet Paşa is building close relations with Mamluk Emirates

743
01:18:52,382 --> 01:18:54,382
Ahmet Paşa...

744
01:18:55,073 --> 01:18:57,125
You won't keep quiet, will you?

745
01:19:02,006 --> 01:19:04,008
You obviously  are after being a traitor

746
01:19:05,033 --> 01:19:07,125
You are making a mountain out of a molehill

747
01:19:08,043 --> 01:19:11,055
This way you are only harmful to yourself, Mahidevran

748
01:19:11,086 --> 01:19:13,172
My Valide, but my Majesty took her out

749
01:19:14,074 --> 01:19:16,074
They are still not back

750
01:19:17,094 --> 01:19:19,118
Perhaps they'll stay a while in where they are

751
01:19:22,274 --> 01:19:24,274
Pull yourself together

752
01:19:24,033 --> 01:19:26,097
Where can Hürrem go leavinh his 3 kids behind?

753
01:19:27,024 --> 01:19:29,082
She could only be away for a day

754
01:19:29,082 --> 01:19:30,711
They'll be back today

755
01:19:31,046 --> 01:19:33,046
We are going to Hatice's in the evening

756
01:19:34,025 --> 01:19:36,025
My lion won't miss that

757
01:19:49,002 --> 01:19:51,002
My Sultana

758
01:19:51,002 --> 01:19:53,028
You are very cheerful today

759
01:19:55,064 --> 01:19:57,064
Look at my birds

760
01:19:57,036 --> 01:19:58,911
My Majesty's gift

761
01:19:59,095 --> 01:20:01,095
Budgerigars

762
01:20:04,076 --> 01:20:06,076
Are not they very beautiful?

763
01:20:07,061 --> 01:20:09,099
They are in love like me and my Majesty

764
01:20:13,086 --> 01:20:15,101
We stayed in the forest until the morning

765
01:20:16,756 --> 01:20:18,756
It was like a dream

766
01:20:25,095 --> 01:20:27,104
Sultan Süleyman Khan His Highness

767
01:20:49,009 --> 01:20:51,073
My Viziers, is there any important matter you want to tell me?

768
01:20:53,407 --> 01:20:55,407
My Majesty, from Egypt

769
01:20:55,448 --> 01:20:57,510
There is a letter from Master Kadızade Mehmet 

770
01:20:58,001 --> 01:21:00,027
Has Ahmet Paşa already started being naughty?

771
01:21:02,051 --> 01:21:04,059
How did you guess that my Majesty?

772
01:21:04,742 --> 01:21:06,756
I don't have to be a fortuneteller for that

773
01:21:06,091 --> 01:21:09,095
I know what kind of feelings Ahmet Paşa had while going to Cairo

774
01:21:10,037 --> 01:21:12,037
I know him well

775
01:21:12,037 --> 01:21:14,059
He can never hold his anger inside of himself

776
01:21:15,078 --> 01:21:17,114
Ahmet Paşa is very close with Mamlouks Emirates

777
01:21:18,645 --> 01:21:20,645
He arranges secret meetings

778
01:21:21,032 --> 01:21:24,114
I don't want to blame, but I think he might be having an affair

779
01:21:26,065 --> 01:21:28,117
My Majesty, shall we intervene?

780
01:21:37,003 --> 01:21:39,003
Send a message to Master Kadızade

781
01:21:39,003 --> 01:21:42,015
She should be his shadow. I want to know every step he takes

782
01:21:44,091 --> 01:21:46,113
Paşas, you should take measures

783
01:21:48,057 --> 01:21:49,123
We shouldn't be unprepared

784
01:21:50,024 --> 01:21:53,076
Even if not today, Ahmet Paşa will be a trouble tomorrow

785
01:22:01,003 --> 01:22:03,029
You are my birds too

786
01:22:04,043 --> 01:22:06,043
You are joyfull too

787
01:22:06,005 --> 01:22:08,005
You are my everything

788
01:22:09,006 --> 01:22:11,060
These birds' sounds bring joy

789
01:22:12,042 --> 01:22:13,046
How fortunate

790
01:22:13,917 --> 01:22:15,917
My Majesty's gift

791
01:22:19,001 --> 01:22:21,069
Gülnihal, when will Selim wake up?

792
01:22:21,078 --> 01:22:22,959
I miss my son very much

793
01:22:23,661 --> 01:22:25,140
Let him sleep

794
01:22:25,018 --> 01:22:27,018
He didn't let me sleep last night

795
01:22:30,082 --> 01:22:33,090
We will be going to Hatice Sultana's palace for dinner in the evening

796
01:22:35,086 --> 01:22:37,086
I have to be very beautiful

797
01:22:41,042 --> 01:22:43,042
I am curious about the palace

798
01:22:44,082 --> 01:22:46,082
Did you say in the evening?

799
01:22:47,051 --> 01:22:49,051
It is already evening, let's prepare

800
01:23:02,007 --> 01:23:03,065
It is too salty

801
01:23:03,065 --> 01:23:05,090
Give me a little bit of dough

802
01:23:05,009 --> 01:23:06,015
Dough?

803
01:23:08,828 --> 01:23:09,832
Will you add dough, chief?

804
01:23:10,228 --> 01:23:11,315
Yes, sparty-pants. I'll add dough

805
01:23:12,002 --> 01:23:13,064
It'll take the dish's salt away

806
01:23:14,021 --> 01:23:16,021
Learn these tricks, learn, learn

807
01:23:16,047 --> 01:23:18,047
Come on, quickly

808
01:23:30,009 --> 01:23:32,009
Mumbar Dolması?

809
01:23:32,009 --> 01:23:33,015
Was I right Şeker Ağa?

810
01:23:34,005 --> 01:23:35,096
You are, my Sümbül Ağa, you ar right

811
01:23:36,047 --> 01:23:38,076
The favourite dish of our Sultan

812
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:40,109
You'll introduce our Sultan's dinner to me

813
01:23:41,032 --> 01:23:43,032
okay

814
01:23:44,011 --> 01:23:44,103
It can't be, my Ağa

815
01:23:45,003 --> 01:23:46,702
It can

816
01:23:46,078 --> 01:23:48,160
Our Majesty is going to have dinner in İbrahim Paşa's palace

817
01:23:49,078 --> 01:23:51,078
His dinner is mine

818
01:23:54,086 --> 01:23:56,088
I'll lay down on the sofa for a while

819
01:23:57,036 --> 01:23:59,043
Wake me up when the dinner is ready

820
01:24:03,068 --> 01:24:05,068
Wake me up

821
01:24:20,001 --> 01:24:22,001
My mother, welcome

822
01:24:22,087 --> 01:24:24,087
My Hatice

823
01:24:25,006 --> 01:24:27,006
Beautiful daughter of me

824
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:36,002
My Sultana

825
01:24:39,028 --> 01:24:41,028
Mahidevran, Gülfem, you are welcomed too

826
01:24:41,094 --> 01:24:43,099
Thank you my Sultana

827
01:24:45,001 --> 01:24:47,012
It is very beautiful here

828
01:24:53,037 --> 01:24:55,037
Will we have the dinner here?

829
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:58,057
Yes, my mother

830

My Valide, is not ur Majesty coming?

832
01:25:13,801 --> 01:25:15,855
My Valide Sultana, wouldn't you like to have a sit?

833
01:25:16,076 --> 01:25:18,079
Our Majesty should be on the way

834
01:25:46,086 --> 01:25:48,086
We've arrived

835
01:25:50,001 --> 01:25:52,003
I wish everyday was like today

836
01:25:52,014 --> 01:25:54,014
With you daytime and nighttime

837
01:25:58,021 --> 01:26:01,057
You cheered me up again, cheerd my soul up

838
01:26:03,086 --> 01:26:05,086
Come on, let's go

839
01:26:05,086 --> 01:26:07,172
Sultan Süleyman Khan His Highness

840
01:26:42,002 --> 01:26:44,002
My Majesty

841
01:26:48,086 --> 01:26:50,086
You are honoring us my Majesty

842
01:27:18,011 --> 01:27:20,011
Where did you get this?

843
01:27:20,024 --> 01:27:22,024
It came from Venice palace

844
01:27:23,000 --> 01:27:25,036
It is Venice Doge's gift

845
01:27:25,087 --> 01:27:27,087
They value you very much

846
01:27:29,006 --> 01:27:31,048
They obviously want to please you

847
01:27:33,068 --> 01:27:35,134
Infidel's new invention

848
01:27:57,078 --> 01:27:59,078
My mother,

849
01:27:59,078 --> 01:28:01,086
It looks like a European Palace

850
01:28:38,073 --> 01:28:40,127
Hold on, hold on

851
01:28:44,967 --> 01:28:46,967
Don't be afraid of me

852
01:28:47,055 --> 01:28:49,055
I'll not do anything that'd harm you

853
01:28:50,015 --> 01:28:52,015
Just, relax

854
01:28:52,094 --> 01:28:54,159
If there's something you don't like, just tell me

855
01:28:56,002 --> 01:28:58,080
If you have a wish, you can just send me a message

856
01:28:59,087 --> 01:29:01,087
I'll do anything for you

857
01:29:04,037 --> 01:29:06,037
Anything?

858
01:29:06,037 --> 01:29:07,768
Whatever you want

859
01:29:09,037 --> 01:29:11,037
Actaully...

860
01:29:11,042 --> 01:29:11,140
There's something

861
01:29:12,003 --> 01:29:14,025
Just wish it and I'll give my life 

862
01:29:15,091 --> 01:29:17,091
I haven't heard...

863
01:29:17,091 --> 01:29:19,117
...from my family since a long time

864
01:29:22,007 --> 01:29:24,007
I wrote a letter but couldn't send

865
01:29:25,006 --> 01:29:26,088
See what you are sad about

866
01:29:27,006 --> 01:29:29,006
Give me and I'll run to send it

867
01:29:39,078 --> 01:29:41,146
There's a big boat at the port

868
01:29:43,002 --> 01:29:45,002
It's name is Fırtına

869
01:29:46,014 --> 01:29:48,014
There's Captain Antonio

870
01:29:48,403 --> 01:29:50,494
Tell him, Victoria's sending

871
01:29:51,087 --> 01:29:53,119
He'd send it to my uncle

872
01:30:43,094 --> 01:30:45,162
Nothing is missing, thank you

873
01:30:47,025 --> 01:30:50,091
But you should know I don't want this in my own palace my lion

874
01:30:51,009 --> 01:30:55,091
I'm pretty happy to eat on my cedar served on silver tray

875
01:30:56,072 --> 01:30:57,078
Alright

876
01:30:59,032 --> 01:31:01,039
This style won't be in your harem

877
01:31:04,002 --> 01:31:06,008
I guess you haven't seen the wall yet

878
01:31:08,003 --> 01:31:09,010
Look

879
01:31:09,007 --> 01:31:11,014
Which eastern palace have such paintings?

880
01:31:17,006 --> 01:31:19,088
What would clerics think if they see this?

881
01:31:20,086 --> 01:31:22,108
İbrahim Paşa should thnk about it

882

887

You are pale, are you okay?

896
01:32:37,009 --> 01:32:39,009
