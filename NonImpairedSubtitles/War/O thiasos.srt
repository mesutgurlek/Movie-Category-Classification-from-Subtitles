1
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:12,718
THE TRAVELLING PLAYERS

2
00:02:11,238 --> 00:02:14,238
A film by Theo Angelopoulos

3
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:26,598
The play you are about to see
in five acts

4
00:02:26,878 --> 00:02:29,878
is Spyridon Peresiades'
immortal idyll

5
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:33,037
''Golfo the Shepherdess'',

6
00:02:33,038 --> 00:02:36,038
with a superb cast
of famous actors,

7
00:02:36,558 --> 00:02:38,517
both seasoned players
and others who are young.

8
00:02:38,518 --> 00:02:40,437
The love of Golfo,

9
00:02:40,438 --> 00:02:42,477
tragic and profound,

10
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:45,478
deep in your heart
will resound.

11
00:03:43,758 --> 00:03:46,758
In the fall of 1952
we returned to Aegion.

12
00:03:47,918 --> 00:03:50,918
A few veterans,
but mostly younger actors.

13
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:57,358
We were tired.

14
00:03:58,198 --> 00:04:01,198
We hadn't slept for two days.

15
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:07,997
LONG LIVE MARSHAL PAPAGOS!

16
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,998
THE SAVIOUR OF THE NATION

17
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:52,598
If we don't want to see
our streets

18
00:04:54,518 --> 00:04:57,518
If we don't want
another Red December...

19
00:04:58,918 --> 00:05:01,918
We must all rally
around the Marshal.

20
00:05:04,678 --> 00:05:07,678
With your vote you can make
this coming Sunday,

21
00:05:09,198 --> 00:05:12,198
the 16th of November 1952,
a historic day.

22
00:05:17,358 --> 00:05:20,358
A day of victory for
the national forces.

23
00:05:22,598 --> 00:05:25,598
This is why you must vote
for Papagos.

24
00:05:30,238 --> 00:05:33,238
By voting for him you vote for
the only national candidate.

25
00:05:38,998 --> 00:05:41,998
For the man who led our
army to victory...

26
00:05:43,998 --> 00:05:46,998
against the communist
rebels in 1947-49.

27
00:05:50,598 --> 00:05:53,598
A vote for the Marshal
is a vote for peace,

28
00:05:55,238 --> 00:05:58,238
prosperity, law and order.

29
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:50,797
Tomorrow afternoon...

30
00:06:50,798 --> 00:06:53,798
The Minister of Propaganda
of the Third Reich, Goebbels,

31
00:06:56,598 --> 00:06:59,598
accompanied by Ioanis Metaxas,
our National Leader,

32
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:04,158
will pass through our town

33
00:07:04,558 --> 00:07:07,558
on his way to ancient Olympia.

34
00:07:08,518 --> 00:07:11,518
The National Youth
Organization

35
00:07:11,878 --> 00:07:14,757
invites everybody
to welcome him,

36
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:17,758
suitably and respectably
dressed for the occasion. ''

37
00:07:43,558 --> 00:07:46,558
Ioannina

38
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:50,998
Lefkada, Xanthi...

39
00:07:54,078 --> 00:07:56,277
Leave it, father.
I'll do it.

40
00:07:56,278 --> 00:07:59,278
Write down the dates too.

41
00:08:00,358 --> 00:08:03,358
You will come back.

42
00:08:03,598 --> 00:08:06,598
No matter how many years go by,
you will come back,

43
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:11,438
full of remorse,
to ask forgiveness.

44
00:08:13,398 --> 00:08:16,398
One night in shame
you will come back.

45
00:08:21,038 --> 00:08:24,038
It won't come out!

46
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:27,278
Why is everyone happy
and smiling, father?

47
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:31,397
Why don't you get
your little bastard.

48
00:08:31,398 --> 00:08:33,477
Dammit!

49
00:08:33,478 --> 00:08:36,077
Dammit!

50
00:08:36,078 --> 00:08:39,078
Because on a golden day
like this, my child

51
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:42,518
the black tears stopped,

52
00:08:43,518 --> 00:08:46,518
old wounds were healed.

53
00:08:50,118 --> 00:08:53,118
The wheat grew tall.

54
00:08:53,598 --> 00:08:56,598
And the stones turned into
flowers and golden streams.

55
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:34,558
Left turn!
Forward march!

56
00:10:44,278 --> 00:10:47,278
Why? Didn't you like it?

57
00:10:48,118 --> 00:10:51,077
You will come back.

58
00:10:51,078 --> 00:10:54,078
No matter how many years go by,
you will come back,

59
00:10:55,718 --> 00:10:58,718
full of remorse,
to ask forgiveness.

60
00:10:59,798 --> 00:11:02,798
Broken-hearted,
you will come back.

61
00:11:10,358 --> 00:11:13,358
Why is everyone happy
and smiling, father?

62
00:11:18,478 --> 00:11:21,478
Why is the sun so bright today?

63
00:11:22,358 --> 00:11:25,358
Why is the day so clear?

64
00:11:26,718 --> 00:11:29,718
Because on a golden day
like this, my child

65
00:11:34,598 --> 00:11:37,598
the black tears stopped,

66
00:11:37,878 --> 00:11:40,878
old wounds were healed.

67
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:43,117
The wheat grew tall

68
00:11:43,118 --> 00:11:46,118
and the stones turned into
flowers and golden streams.

69
00:12:03,078 --> 00:12:06,078
You, this way.
In room 15, the others in 17!

70
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:42,638
The day has come and in the
dawn the morning star has set.

71
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:46,678
The peaks are drenched in
sunlight and nightingales sing.

72
00:14:47,518 --> 00:14:50,518
Partridges bathe in the streams

73
00:14:51,438 --> 00:14:53,757
but the proudest partridge
of them all,

74
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:56,758
the beautiful Golfo,
has not appeared.

75
00:14:59,518 --> 00:15:02,157
But here she comes!

76
00:15:02,158 --> 00:15:03,957
Good day to you, Tassos.

77
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,958
Good day to you, Tassos.

78
00:15:06,998 --> 00:15:09,277
Good day to you, Golfo.

79
00:15:09,278 --> 00:15:11,037
They might be watching!

80
00:15:11,038 --> 00:15:14,038
No one can see us
save the birds of the forest.

81
00:15:14,358 --> 00:15:15,757
And the birds?

82
00:15:15,758 --> 00:15:18,758
Not like that... scared... the
way your mother would say it.

83
00:15:24,558 --> 00:15:26,677
No one can see us

84
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:29,678
save the birds of the forest
and the surrounding peaks.

85
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:34,957
And the birds?

86
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:37,958
From the beginning, comrade.

87
00:22:00,638 --> 00:22:03,638
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

88
00:22:57,278 --> 00:23:00,278
Hello, mother.

89
00:23:01,358 --> 00:23:04,358
Don't look at me.
I look awfuI in the morning.

90
00:23:09,318 --> 00:23:11,757
I'm on a 48-hour pass.

91
00:23:11,758 --> 00:23:14,758
We leave for the border
in a couple of days.

92
00:23:16,718 --> 00:23:19,718
At least you don't hate me
like your sisters.

93
00:23:20,078 --> 00:23:23,037
Still the same obsession!

94
00:23:23,038 --> 00:23:25,357
I knew you'd come.

95
00:23:25,358 --> 00:23:28,358
- Again?
- I dreamt about it.

96
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:39,278
No, this was something
different.

97
00:23:40,238 --> 00:23:43,238
We were in a garden.
It was summer.

98
00:23:46,118 --> 00:23:49,118
You were three or
four years old.

99
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:53,398
The air was fragrant.
Someone was singing.

100
00:24:01,878 --> 00:24:04,878
No, it was Mr. Kokinos playing
the violin. Remember him?

101
00:24:10,238 --> 00:24:13,238
Then, I don't know
what happened.

102
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:17,038
You ran to me.
Hid between my legs.

103
00:24:22,678 --> 00:24:25,678
I held you tight

104
00:24:27,318 --> 00:24:30,318
untll you started to sink
inside me

105
00:24:32,558 --> 00:24:35,558
and disappeared.

106
00:24:36,358 --> 00:24:39,358
I got up then.

107
00:24:41,198 --> 00:24:44,198
Mr. Kokinos was still playing
the violin.

108
00:24:46,758 --> 00:24:49,758
But I couId feel you inside me.

109
00:24:54,598 --> 00:24:57,598
Good day to you, Tassos.

110
00:24:58,718 --> 00:25:01,718
Welcome, beautiful partridge,
for whom my eyes pined.

111
00:25:08,478 --> 00:25:11,478
Good day to you, Golfo.

112
00:25:13,078 --> 00:25:16,078
Orestes! Orestes!

113
00:25:30,758 --> 00:25:33,758
Orestes!

114
00:25:53,238 --> 00:25:55,397
How are you, father?

115
00:25:55,398 --> 00:25:58,398
I am rotting!

116
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:08,598
The daisy told me
that you don't love me.

117
00:26:09,838 --> 00:26:12,838
That you no longer adore me.

118
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:17,158
You cannot melt away
my sadness,

119
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:21,958
however sweet your caresses...

120
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,677
however sweet your caresses...

121
00:26:45,678 --> 00:26:48,678
however sweet your caresses...

122
00:26:48,958 --> 00:26:51,877
having great power.

123
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:54,878
And the earth was illuminated
with his gIory.

124
00:26:55,278 --> 00:26:58,278
And he cried out
in a mighty voice saying:

125
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,718
Babylon! Babylon the great
has fallen!

126
00:27:21,998 --> 00:27:24,357
When are you leaving?

127
00:27:24,358 --> 00:27:27,358
Tomorrow morning...

128
00:27:29,638 --> 00:27:32,638
for the border,
from what they say.

129
00:27:36,318 --> 00:27:39,318
Then we'll soon be
at war here, too.

130
00:28:34,798 --> 00:28:37,798
One night I crossed the river!

131
00:28:51,078 --> 00:28:54,078
There can be no doubt for
any Marxist, that a revolution

132
00:28:55,638 --> 00:28:58,638
is impossibIe without
revolutionary conditions.

133
00:28:58,998 --> 00:29:01,998
What are the characteristics
of revolutionary conditions?

134
00:29:03,318 --> 00:29:06,318
When a crisis breaks out
in the rullng classes

135
00:29:07,598 --> 00:29:10,598
When a crisis breaks out
in the rullng classes

136
00:29:12,078 --> 00:29:14,677
and indignation of the
oppressed classes emerge.

137
00:29:14,678 --> 00:29:16,837
When the misery
and suffering

138
00:29:16,838 --> 00:29:19,838
of the oppressed classes
take a more acute form.

139
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:22,597
When as a consequence of
the above mentioned conditions

140
00:29:22,598 --> 00:29:25,437
there is a great increase in
the activity of the masses

141
00:29:25,438 --> 00:29:28,438
who in times of peace quietly
allow themselves to be robbed

142
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:31,717
but in revolutionary times
are forced by circumstances

143
00:29:31,718 --> 00:29:34,718
and the crisis in the rullng
classes

144
00:29:35,318 --> 00:29:38,318
towards independent
historical action.

145
00:29:39,438 --> 00:29:42,077
We must explain to
all governments:

146
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:45,078
We know you are the armed force
against the proletariat.

147
00:29:47,158 --> 00:29:49,237
We will march against you,

148
00:29:49,238 --> 00:29:52,238
in peace, whenever possibIe,

149
00:29:53,118 --> 00:29:56,118
with guns when it becomes
unavoidable.

150
00:31:09,758 --> 00:31:12,758
Feasts! Bread! Gallows!

151
00:32:22,478 --> 00:32:25,478
Tell me, girls...

152
00:32:26,398 --> 00:32:29,398
How are you doing?
Where are you going?

153
00:32:32,358 --> 00:32:35,358
Here comes Golfo
and there's Tassos, too.

154
00:32:36,398 --> 00:32:39,398
Come in and see them.

155
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:43,997
Outside don't wait,

156
00:32:43,998 --> 00:32:45,877
the play is great!

157
00:32:45,878 --> 00:32:48,878
Don't debate,
it's already eight!

158
00:33:03,438 --> 00:33:06,438
Tell me, you guys...

159
00:33:07,638 --> 00:33:10,638
How are you doing?
Where are you going?

160
00:33:14,238 --> 00:33:17,238
Here comes Golfo
and there's Tassos too.

161
00:33:18,718 --> 00:33:21,718
Come in and see them.

162
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:57,398
The day has come and in the
dawn the morning star has set.

163
00:34:58,878 --> 00:35:01,878
The peaks are drenched in
sunlight and nightingales sing.

164
00:35:02,038 --> 00:35:05,038
Partridges bathe in the streams

165
00:35:05,718 --> 00:35:08,357
but the proudest partridge
of them all,

166
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:11,358
the beautiful Golfo,
has not appeared.

167
00:35:14,118 --> 00:35:16,317
But here she comes!

168
00:35:16,318 --> 00:35:17,997
Good day to you, Tassos.

169
00:35:17,998 --> 00:35:19,517
Welcome beautiful partridge,

170
00:35:19,518 --> 00:35:22,237
for whom my eyes pined.

171
00:35:22,238 --> 00:35:23,957
They might be watching!

172
00:35:23,958 --> 00:35:26,117
No one can see us save the
birds of the forest

173
00:35:26,118 --> 00:35:26,917
and the surrounding peaks.

174
00:35:26,918 --> 00:35:28,237
And the birds?

175
00:35:28,238 --> 00:35:30,437
What is it?
What's wrong, Golfo?

176
00:35:30,438 --> 00:35:33,438
How can we be together when you
run from the eagle's shadow.

177
00:35:35,478 --> 00:35:37,197
How can we be together when you
run from the eagle's shadow.

178
00:35:37,198 --> 00:35:40,037
I thought it was the shadow
of a man.

179
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:41,637
Don't be afraid.

180
00:35:41,638 --> 00:35:44,638
Only God is here to see us

181
00:35:45,758 --> 00:35:48,758
and surely it is His wish

182
00:35:50,518 --> 00:35:53,518
that we love each other
faithfully and honourably.

183
00:35:56,558 --> 00:35:59,558
Look around you Golfo at
the clouds around us

184
00:36:02,198 --> 00:36:05,198
which like a mist, like a
blanket thrown from heaven

185
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:08,517
shield us from mallcious gossip

186
00:36:08,518 --> 00:36:09,517
and indiscreet eyes.

187
00:36:09,518 --> 00:36:12,518
You are my only thought,
my only dream...

188
00:36:12,638 --> 00:36:14,997
And truly I pray for you

189
00:36:14,998 --> 00:36:17,998
and light a candle
to the Virgin Mary.

190
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:43,477
You will come back.

191
00:39:43,478 --> 00:39:46,478
No matter how many years go by,
you will come back,

192
00:39:47,078 --> 00:39:50,078
full of remorse,
to ask forgiveness.

193
00:39:50,798 --> 00:39:53,798
One night in shame
you will come back.

194
00:40:13,518 --> 00:40:16,518
When you reallze
you were mistaken,

195
00:40:17,398 --> 00:40:20,398
broken-hearted
you will come back.

196
00:41:37,638 --> 00:41:40,638
In the meantime the Turks
occupied Karahissar.

197
00:41:43,558 --> 00:41:46,558
It was August 1922.

198
00:41:47,798 --> 00:41:50,798
The front was breaking up.

199
00:41:51,478 --> 00:41:54,478
Our soldiers arrived,
threw down their arms.

200
00:41:57,558 --> 00:42:00,558
The Greek Army no longer
existed. Disaster had struck.

201
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:06,318
I managed to board
an Italian ship,

202
00:42:06,798 --> 00:42:09,798
swimming all the way
from Aghia Triada.

203
00:42:12,638 --> 00:42:14,837
Thank God there were
the Italians.

204
00:42:14,838 --> 00:42:17,277
They had designs
on Asia Minor too

205
00:42:17,278 --> 00:42:19,397
but they were more human,

206
00:42:19,398 --> 00:42:22,117
but they were more human,

207
00:42:22,118 --> 00:42:24,717
and bringing them to
Greek soil.

208
00:42:24,718 --> 00:42:27,718
Whlle the French, the Americans
and especially the British

209
00:42:29,238 --> 00:42:32,238
who helped cause the war as
it served their own interests

210
00:42:33,718 --> 00:42:36,718
showed the worst conduct.

211
00:42:38,958 --> 00:42:41,357
I boarded that ship

212
00:42:41,358 --> 00:42:44,358
with nothing on but my pants.

213
00:42:47,518 --> 00:42:50,518
Finally, we arrived
in Keratsini.

214
00:42:51,998 --> 00:42:54,998
I was so hungry.

215
00:42:55,518 --> 00:42:58,518
I longed for spaghetti
cooked in oil.

216
00:42:59,998 --> 00:43:02,117
I kept saying to myself:

217
00:43:02,118 --> 00:43:05,118
I wish I had something to eat!

218
00:43:11,438 --> 00:43:14,438
I jumped into the sea.
The others jumped too.

219
00:43:15,918 --> 00:43:18,918
I jumped into the sea.
The others jumped too.

220
00:43:20,118 --> 00:43:23,118
He gave me an old shirt
to wear.

221
00:43:24,438 --> 00:43:27,438
I set out for Piraeus with
a man from Chios.

222
00:43:30,438 --> 00:43:33,438
We reached a country tavern
where they were cooking beans.

223
00:43:36,558 --> 00:43:39,558
There was a couple inside.

224
00:43:40,638 --> 00:43:43,638
I asked for some water.

225
00:43:45,118 --> 00:43:48,118
''Where are you from?''
they asked.

226
00:43:50,118 --> 00:43:53,118
''We are the first refugees
from Asia Minor,'' I replied.

227
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:57,198
''Sit down,'' said the couple.
''Give them something to eat. ''

228
00:44:00,318 --> 00:44:03,318
We ate a whole portion
of beans.

229
00:44:06,198 --> 00:44:09,198
They also treated us
to some retsina wine.

230
00:44:12,238 --> 00:44:15,238
It turned out that they
were royalists.

231
00:44:19,438 --> 00:44:22,438
It turned out that they
were royalists.

232
00:44:25,278 --> 00:44:28,278
And some nonsense about
the last king of Byzantium.

233
00:44:33,478 --> 00:44:36,478
I said: ''I've eaten, I thank
you, goodbye!'' And we left.

234
00:44:39,158 --> 00:44:42,158
I was furious.

235
00:44:43,518 --> 00:44:46,518
We spent the night
in a church in Piraeus.

236
00:44:48,158 --> 00:44:51,158
All the refugees
had gathered there.

237
00:44:51,318 --> 00:44:54,318
I slept in a pushcart.

238
00:45:02,518 --> 00:45:05,437
In the morning
I told my companion from Chios:

239
00:45:05,438 --> 00:45:08,438
''We'll go find work. ''

240
00:45:08,518 --> 00:45:11,077
''Where?'' he said.

241
00:45:11,078 --> 00:45:14,078
''Wherever we see a smoke
stack, we'll go. ''

242
00:45:17,598 --> 00:45:20,598
We finally saw one.

243
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,318
I was barefoot.

244
00:45:25,518 --> 00:45:28,518
I asked the guard
at the factory:

245
00:45:34,078 --> 00:45:37,078
''Excuse me, we are refugees.
Are there any jobs for us?''

246
00:45:40,878 --> 00:45:43,878
''Come in,'' he said.

247
00:45:48,358 --> 00:45:51,358
They gave us 2 drachmas a day
and a place to sleep.

248
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:57,318
It was better than nothing!

249
00:45:57,878 --> 00:46:00,878
In the meantime I wondered

250
00:46:02,118 --> 00:46:05,118
what had happened to my famlly.

251
00:46:06,038 --> 00:46:08,317
I saw an old neighbour.

252
00:46:08,318 --> 00:46:11,037
How are you?

253
00:46:11,038 --> 00:46:14,038
He was the brother of
Vassilis, the actor.

254
00:46:26,798 --> 00:46:29,798
''Your oldest brother was lost,''
he told me.

255
00:46:33,758 --> 00:46:36,758
''Your father, mother and
the kid got off at Mytilene. ''

256
00:46:46,958 --> 00:46:49,958
I searched heaven and earth
to find them.

257
00:46:55,078 --> 00:46:58,078
But I never did.

258
00:48:07,078 --> 00:48:10,078
Black is the night on
the mountains,

259
00:48:10,798 --> 00:48:13,798
On the cliffs, the snow
is falling.

260
00:48:14,678 --> 00:48:17,157
In the wilderness,
in the darkness...

261
00:48:17,158 --> 00:48:20,158
on the hills, on the rocks,
on the paths...

262
00:48:22,638 --> 00:48:25,638
The Greek draws his sword!

263
00:51:02,518 --> 00:51:05,518
At 5:30 this morning,
28th October, 1940.

264
00:51:05,718 --> 00:51:08,718
the Italian Armed Forces
attacked our frontiers

265
00:51:11,678 --> 00:51:14,678
along the Greek-Albanian
border.

266
00:51:17,318 --> 00:51:20,318
Our forces are defending
the land of our fathers!

267
00:51:23,598 --> 00:51:26,598
Our show tonight
is dedicated...

268
00:51:27,558 --> 00:51:30,558
to this first army communique

269
00:51:31,478 --> 00:51:34,478
and to victory.

270
00:51:59,358 --> 00:52:02,358
The day has come and in the
dawn the morning star has set.

271
00:52:03,038 --> 00:52:06,038
The peaks are drenched in
sunlight and nightingales sing.

272
00:52:06,318 --> 00:52:09,318
Partridges bathe in the streams

273
00:52:10,158 --> 00:52:13,077
but the proudest of them all,

274
00:52:13,078 --> 00:52:16,078
the beautiful Golfo,
has not appeared.

275
00:52:17,478 --> 00:52:20,478
But here she comes.

276
00:52:20,718 --> 00:52:22,077
Good day to you, Tassos.

277
00:52:22,078 --> 00:52:25,078
Welcome, beautiful partridge,
for whom my eyes pined.

278
00:52:27,718 --> 00:52:29,717
They might be watching.

279
00:52:29,718 --> 00:52:32,437
No one can see us save
the birds of the forest

280
00:52:32,438 --> 00:52:34,117
No one can see us save
the birds of the forest

281
00:52:34,118 --> 00:52:35,677
And the birds?

282
00:52:35,678 --> 00:52:38,077
What is it?
What's wrong, Golfo?

283
00:52:38,078 --> 00:52:41,078
How can we be together when you
run from the eagle's shadow.

284
00:52:46,878 --> 00:52:48,877
I was terrified.

285
00:52:48,878 --> 00:52:51,878
I thought it was the shadow
of a man.

286
00:52:53,998 --> 00:52:56,157
Don't be afraid.

287
00:52:56,158 --> 00:52:59,158
Only God is here to see us
and surely it is His wish

288
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:02,718
that we love each other
faithfully and honourabIy.

289
00:54:52,518 --> 00:54:55,518
The daisy told me that
you don't love me...

290
00:54:57,438 --> 00:55:00,438
that you no longer adore me.

291
00:55:07,318 --> 00:55:10,318
I did it!

292
00:55:21,478 --> 00:55:23,397
At first they didn't want
to take me.

293
00:55:23,398 --> 00:55:25,837
I said: ''Take me even
as an auxiliary. ''

294
00:55:25,838 --> 00:55:28,838
In the end they took me.

295
01:02:41,118 --> 01:02:44,118
Undress.

296
01:05:36,118 --> 01:05:39,118
Are you coming?

297
01:06:52,118 --> 01:06:55,118
Are you coming?

298
01:06:56,278 --> 01:06:59,278
where everything in life
is fleeting.

299
01:07:12,558 --> 01:07:15,558
Come and place a kiss
on my hair.

300
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:18,598
If we don't want to see
our streets

301
01:07:19,478 --> 01:07:22,478
smeared once again with the
hammer and sickle.

302
01:07:25,878 --> 01:07:28,878
If we don't want another
Red December...

303
01:07:29,358 --> 01:07:32,358
We must all rally around
the Marshal.

304
01:07:34,358 --> 01:07:37,358
We must all rally around
the Marshal.

305
01:07:38,838 --> 01:07:41,838
the 16th of November, 1952,
a historic day.

306
01:07:46,278 --> 01:07:49,278
A day of victory
for the national forces.

307
01:07:50,758 --> 01:07:53,758
This is why you must vote
for Papagos.

308
01:07:55,838 --> 01:07:58,838
A vote for the Marshal

309
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:02,158
is a vote for the only
national candidate.

310
01:08:05,078 --> 01:08:08,078
For the man who led our
army to victory...

311
01:08:09,838 --> 01:08:12,838
against the communist
rebels in 1947-49.

312
01:08:16,998 --> 01:08:19,998
His victory will mean peace,
prosperity, law and order.

313
01:10:49,918 --> 01:10:52,918
Is this where you said the
Englishman was hiding?

314
01:11:47,878 --> 01:11:50,878
You!

315
01:12:00,878 --> 01:12:02,677
I was terrified.

316
01:12:02,678 --> 01:12:05,678
I thought it was the
shadow of a man.

317
01:12:18,238 --> 01:12:20,157
You made me drunk,
you made me mad.

318
01:12:20,158 --> 01:12:23,158
I lost my head.
I don't know what to say.

319
01:12:32,798 --> 01:12:35,798
Oh, God! They'll kill
each other!

320
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:45,637
Oh, God! They'll kill
each other!

321
01:12:45,638 --> 01:12:48,638
And I'll scratch your eyes out,
you and that witch.

322
01:12:59,638 --> 01:13:02,517
Take this bread
and cheese, child.

323
01:13:02,518 --> 01:13:05,518
I'll go and tend my sheep.

324
01:13:14,038 --> 01:13:15,997
Are you still standing,
you ingrate!

325
01:13:15,998 --> 01:13:18,998
Kneel and ask forgiveness
from that angel!

326
01:13:29,678 --> 01:13:32,437
Kneel and ask forgiveness
from that angel!

327
01:13:32,438 --> 01:13:35,197
is Spyridon Peresiades'
immortal idyll

328
01:13:35,198 --> 01:13:38,198
''Golfo, the Shepherdess'',
with a superb cast...

329
01:14:03,398 --> 01:14:06,398
It looks like the Englishman
managed to escape at night.

330
01:14:09,118 --> 01:14:12,118
We have information he was
hiding on stage last night,

331
01:14:12,158 --> 01:14:15,158
disguised as a woman.

332
01:14:17,358 --> 01:14:20,358
disguised as a woman.

333
01:14:20,518 --> 01:14:23,518
Informer!

334
01:14:37,958 --> 01:14:40,958
Bitch!

335
01:15:03,638 --> 01:15:06,638
I came from beyond the sea,
from Ionia. And you?

336
01:15:27,838 --> 01:15:30,838
Fire!

337
01:16:16,798 --> 01:16:19,798
I can feel your daughter
watching us like a dog.

338
01:16:21,158 --> 01:16:24,158
Why don't you send her away?

339
01:17:58,478 --> 01:18:01,478
Anyone who doesn't like it
can leave!

340
01:20:49,878 --> 01:20:52,878
I escaped from prison
with six others.

341
01:20:53,038 --> 01:20:56,038
When the front collapsed, they
handed us over to the Nazis.

342
01:20:58,198 --> 01:21:01,117
The resistance movement
is growing, Electra...

343
01:21:01,118 --> 01:21:03,077
I got a message from Orestes.

344
01:21:03,078 --> 01:21:06,078
I'm leaving for the mountains
to find him.

345
01:25:37,398 --> 01:25:40,398
How many ships have floundered

346
01:25:42,078 --> 01:25:45,078
in your eyes blue as the sea.

347
01:25:47,038 --> 01:25:50,038
Ships whose only purpose
was to dock

348
01:25:51,398 --> 01:25:54,398
in love's harbour.

349
01:25:55,878 --> 01:25:58,878
In your mischievous blue eyes,
my wildest dreams,

350
01:26:00,118 --> 01:26:03,118
my sweetest dreams
were swallowed up,

351
01:26:04,838 --> 01:26:07,838
my sweetest dreams
were swallowed up,

352
01:26:09,478 --> 01:26:12,478
hurllng against the rocks
of your heart.

353
01:26:16,878 --> 01:26:19,878
Never before in my life

354
01:26:22,038 --> 01:26:25,038
have I ever seen such eyes,

355
01:26:25,758 --> 01:26:28,758
so blue, so large, so bright.

356
01:28:47,678 --> 01:28:50,678
Tell me, you girls...

357
01:28:52,038 --> 01:28:54,197
Where are we going?

358
01:28:54,198 --> 01:28:57,198
What are we eating?

359
01:28:58,878 --> 01:29:01,878
How I love the girls...

360
01:29:03,598 --> 01:29:06,598
a bit of thigh,
a bit of breast...

361
01:29:15,198 --> 01:29:18,198
come to the cafe..
with a wonderfuI play.

362
01:29:19,758 --> 01:29:21,997
Such lips and eyes.

363
01:29:21,998 --> 01:29:24,157
Such firm young bodies

364
01:29:24,158 --> 01:29:27,158
you'll never hope to find
anywhere.

365
01:37:00,878 --> 01:37:03,878
Everyone outside!

366
01:39:51,878 --> 01:39:54,878
Me, comrade!

367
01:40:37,078 --> 01:40:40,078
It's the partisans!

368
01:41:02,398 --> 01:41:05,398
Turn off the lights!

369
01:42:50,118 --> 01:42:53,118
They're gone!
They're gone!

370
01:45:15,398 --> 01:45:18,398
Now is the time to forge
the publlc order...

371
01:45:20,318 --> 01:45:23,318
and our democratic liberties!

372
01:45:25,118 --> 01:45:28,118
Countrymen, let us unite

373
01:45:32,718 --> 01:45:35,718
with the national army
and our allies

374
01:45:40,678 --> 01:45:43,678
for the liberation of Greece,

375
01:45:44,358 --> 01:45:46,517
under the leadership

376
01:45:46,518 --> 01:45:49,518
of a government of
National Unity.

377
01:45:52,878 --> 01:45:55,878
GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY

378
01:46:12,958 --> 01:46:15,958
FREEDOM TO THE PEOPLE

379
01:46:26,038 --> 01:46:29,038
And now happy at last,

380
01:46:30,438 --> 01:46:33,438
free from fascism!

381
01:46:36,558 --> 01:46:39,558
We can all go home, brothers,
together, all together,

382
01:46:43,598 --> 01:46:46,598
now that the occupation
is over.

383
01:47:02,358 --> 01:47:05,358
Enslaved people,
tortured people,

384
01:47:13,478 --> 01:47:16,478
the wind of freedom is
blowing. Onward!

385
01:47:21,798 --> 01:47:24,798
And all together let us cry:
Onward, brothers!

386
01:47:29,638 --> 01:47:32,638
THE WIND OF FREEDOM IS
BLOWING. ONWARD!

387
01:47:36,238 --> 01:47:39,238
AND ALL TOGETHER LET US CRY:
ONWARD, BROTHERS!

388
01:47:43,718 --> 01:47:46,718
Partisans, soldiers of
the People's Army!

389
01:47:48,398 --> 01:47:51,398
Break the bonds of slavery!

390
01:47:54,758 --> 01:47:57,758
The bell of freedom is ringing!

391
01:48:03,158 --> 01:48:06,158
Let all the slaves rise up!

392
01:48:10,398 --> 01:48:13,398
THE BELL OF FREEDOM IS RINGING!
