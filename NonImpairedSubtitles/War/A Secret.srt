00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:45,080
THIS STORY AND ITS MAIN CHARACTERS
ARE BASED ON TRUE EVENTS.

2
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,360
François.

3
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,720
Did you wash properly?

4
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,920
SUMMER 1955

5
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,040
Now get in the water.
You can watch me.

6
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,200
You can be on your own for a minute.

7
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,680
François.

8
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,800
Yes?
- Paul's here.

9
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,720
Go on in, Paul.

10
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,320
How are you this morning?

11
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:29,760
SUMMER 1985

12
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,320
Are you OK?

13
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,280
Want to open the door?

14
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,520
We can leave it open if you like.

15
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,000
So you went out with your mom yesterday?

16
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,600
Here...
Come sit down.

17
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
I'm writing about you...
doing your portrait.

18
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,760
Louise?
Everything alright?

19
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:36,240
Not really.
It's your father.

20
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,960
He took the dog out without its leash.

21
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,440
The poor thing got run over.

22
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,560
He was sick with grief.

23
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,760
He's been gone nearly three hours now.

24
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,920
Your mother didn't want to disturb you.

25
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,920
If you don't swim,
you get cold.

26
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,520
Go play with the others and warm up.

27
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,600
Thirty all.

28
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,800
Maxime?

29
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,880
Fourty-thirty.

30
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,120
I'll join you at the beach soon.
- We're going.

31
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,720
He's cold.

32
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,880
New ball.

33
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,080
Although an only child,
I long had a brother.

34
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,160
In the courtyard of my childhood home,

35
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,120
neither my neighbors or parents
were aware of this glorious brother,

36
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,600
better looking and stronger than me.

37
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:27,720
A phantom brother capable of
overcoming every obstacle,

38
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:29,560
rising above my failures.

39
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,640
I'd invented him for myself alone,
for my own ends.

40
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:39,120
What are you doing there?
- Nothing.

41
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,240
Nothing?

42
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,720
Then come do the rings with me.

43
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,680
Give me your hands.

44
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,520
Rub them.

45
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,310
Now look.

46
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,000
Take a deep breath,
pull on your arms,

47
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,240
lift your knees.

48
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,160
Touch the other side.

49
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,760
Come back up...
and follow through.

50
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,800
Your turn.

51
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,280
Grab the rings, pull,
lift your knees.

52
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,390
Lift.
Start over.

53
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,520
Pull up, then lift your legs.

54
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,920
Go on, push.

55
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,640
Go on, lift.

56
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,840
That's it for today.

57
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,600
I walked in my phantom brother's shadow.

58
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,800
I floated on his footsteps.

59
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,880
I'd even invented a game
so that he could share our meals.

60
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,520
Let me give you more.

61
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,520
First he wants more.

62
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:09,160
Who?
Who wants more?

63
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,000
Look at me.

64
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,600
I said, who wants more?

65
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,040
He does.
- Who is he?

66
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,960
My brother.

67
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,960
Now listen.
Put that plate down.

68
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,630
There's no one else at this table.

69
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,240
Just you, Mommy and me.

70
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,680
You, Mommy and me.

71
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,350
Where you going?

72
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:46,360
I'm going to Louise's.

73
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,320
Louise had always been part of our life.

74
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:56,520
She'd known my parents for ages,
I'd always known her.

75
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,630
She treated me several times a week.

76
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:01,680
Careful, don't burn yourself.

77
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,240
I spent less time in the shop than at her place.

78
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,640
Why the face?

79
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,470
I hate your shots.

80
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:10,960
But you like hot chocolate.

81
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,070
Aren't you sad not to have kids?

82
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:16,480
I have you.
Isn't that enough?

83
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,600
One of your own,
that you have with a husband.

84
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,800
I don't have a husband.

85
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:26,520
Give me that and lie down.

86
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,430
How come you don't?

87
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,640
There's no room for one.

88
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,520
Grow up fast.
I'll wait.

89
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,080
You're not pretty enough.
- Tough.

90
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,240
Don't start.
It doesn't hurt a bit.

91
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,120
You're my little ganef.

92
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,640
You stink of cigarettes.

93
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:54,640
What's ganef mean?

94
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,400
It means 'my little rascal,' my little darling.

95
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,480
You're my little rascal.

96
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,680
Leave that alone.

97
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,360
Why?
- Put that back.

98
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,680
It's full of fleas.

99
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,680
Stop.

100
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,920
Don't.

101
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,640
Mommy.

102
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,400
You going?

103
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,480
Stop it.

104
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,320
No.
Don't, I said.

105
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:58,280
Stop it.

106
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,160
Where you going?

107
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,750
Stop.
It's full of fleas.

108
00:13:05,850 --> 00:13:07,550
Put that back.

109
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,950
Who are you talking to?
Tell me.

110
00:13:10,050 --> 00:13:11,640
Mommy's here now.

111
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:20,760
You had a nightmare.

112
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,840
Everything's alright, now.
I'm watching over you.

113
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,000
François Grimbert?

114
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,600
Yes, Grimbert.
With an 'M' and a 'T.'

115
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,200
Wait a second.
Look at me.

116
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:47,590
You look nice like that.

117
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:50,160
Don't tell Grandpa you were baptized.

118
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,600
Why not?

119
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,000
Because

120
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,390
Talking about churches and cemeteries

121
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,120
might make him sad.

122
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,110
Boy, if ever Papa finds out.

123
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,720
If nobody tells him,
he won't find out.

124
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,080
Stop staring at me.

125
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,280
It's just beyond belief.

126
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,710
Circumcision,
then a goy baptism.

127
00:15:20,810 --> 00:15:22,560
You must be nuts.

128
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,480
Eavesdropping?

129
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,320
You've got nerve,
and you're a mess.

130
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,800
How'd you get so heavy?

131
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:33,120
The holy water seems to suit him.

132
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,830
You went to the ceremony

133
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,280
So?
I'm not family.

134
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,120
I go where I like.

135
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,920
And I do what I like.

136
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,280
I cut hair for meshuggeners during the war.

137
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,000
They were really meshugge.

138
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,880
Not as bad as the Germans,
but they wanted this and that,

139
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,200
they had to have a quiff just so.

140
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,720
And the Brylcreem.

141
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,990
A bit more here, a bit more there,

142
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,640
never enough Brylcreem.

143
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,360
So, fella,
still leader of the pack?

144
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,830
Yep, honor roll.

145
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,830
So you're tops in everything?

146
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:13,480
Except gym, but he's exempt.

147
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,510
Until then,
he's tops in everything.

148
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:17,800
Until what,
we wonder?

149
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,520
Until he grows stronger.

150
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,800
The doctor says so.

151
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,880
Gym's useless.

152
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,600
Just kidding.

153
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,990
Can't be good at everything.

154
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,880
No apple pie for me?

155
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,400
Didn't I serve you?

156
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:48,000
Not in my house.

157
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:56,000
'Search the forest carefully.
A secret is hidden there.

158
00:16:56,360 --> 00:17:00,280
'Long under a spell,
Sir Grimbert...'

159
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,190
'Grimbert,' like us.
- Don't move.

160
00:17:02,290 --> 00:17:04,800
Hear that?
'Sir Grimbert'.

161
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:07,520
That's neat.
- It dates to the Middle Ages.

162
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,990
What's he going on about?

163
00:17:09,090 --> 00:17:11,280
Head down.
Don't move.

164
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,880
Bring me your puzzle.

165
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:17,960
Afterwards. If he moves again,
I'll cut off an ear.

166
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,040
He's not back?

167
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,960
Come look.

168
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,200
Your dad came back to drop off the dog, then left.

169
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,120
That was three hours ago.

170
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:00,270
He wouldn't use the leash.

171
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:04,120
He said fox terriers
were made to run, not be cooped up.

172
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,640
Guess what?
They measured me at school.

173
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,760
I grew two inches.

174
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,360
Nice going.

175
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,960
You'll be taller than your dad,
he'll be pleased for once.

176
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,080
Yeah, he'll be real pleased.

177
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:56,720
Tomorrow, I'm going to put flowers on Olga's grave.

178
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,030
What did your cousin Olga die of?

179
00:18:59,130 --> 00:19:01,600
During the war, while traveling.

180
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,670
Give me your arm.

181
00:19:03,770 --> 00:19:04,960
Was she sick?

182
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,000
The other arm.

183
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,040
What did she die of, then?

184
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,680
The Nazis killed her.
I know they did.

185
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,760
Why are you asking then?

186
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:22,830
What're you up to?

187
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,040
Nothing.
We're just talking.

188
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:54,520
You're tense.

189
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:44,880
I was long a boy who dreamed of the perfect family.

190
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,680
From the rare images I was allowed to glimpse,

191
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:52,910
a few uttered words,
snippets of information.

192
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,520
I made up my parents' idyll,
as if I were writing a romance.

193
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,800
I imagined they shared a love of sports

194
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:22,440
at a time when thousands of Germans

195
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,520
shared the same passion.

196
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,000
Playing sports made Dad hope
he could erase his origins.

197
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,800
Mom modeled for designers,

198
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:41,560
and did sketches for a fashion magazine.

199
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:51,760
GENERAL MOBILIZATION
FIGHTING ON THE GERMAN-POLISH FRONT

200
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:56,550
Oddly, my parents
never talked about the Occupation.

201
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:59,760
They kept it from me like a shameful secret.

202
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,000
I was reduced to imagining the period.

203
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,480
Like I invented a brother,
I devised my own improbable narrative.

204
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,160
1942

205
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:29,720
Due to the hardships
my parents crossed the Demarcation Line.

206
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,840
I imagined their place of refuge, St Gaultier,

207
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,560
a memory of bliss.

208
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:54,120
That's where I wish I'd been born,

209
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,640
lovingly conceived after one of their walks.

210
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,510
Summer '44

211
00:23:06,610 --> 00:23:09,520
For my parents,
death, suffering, terror

212
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,680
all remained in the confines of the radio.

213
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:36,840
Tania pressured Maxime into having a child.

214
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:43,280
At last, the fruit of their union arrives: Me,

215
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:46,320
so different from the one they dreamed of.

216
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,800
4 pounds, 8 ounces.
Not much.

217
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,240
It's a little baby.

218
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,960
My father's first gaze left its mark on me.

219
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,400
Time and again,
I would catch that bitter glint.

220
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:08,440
Later, he said of my conception
that I slipped out of him.

221
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,600
SPRING 1962

222
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:32,960
May I?

223
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,480
You go to Berthelot School, huh?

224
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,160
Me, too.

225
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:56,840
You're in 9th grade?

226
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,720
You're a real egghead.
I'm repeating 8th grade.

227
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:04,520
My name's Rebecca Finkiel.

228
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,440
François Grimbert.

229
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,230
See that woman there?

230
00:27:13,330 --> 00:27:15,440
Boy, you should see her swim.

231
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:17,880
She's so gorgeous.

232
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,400
That's my mother.

233
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,560
I have to go.

234
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,520
Who's the pretty girl?

235
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,040
I don't know.
She's from school.

236
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,840
She's cute.
- What's her name?

237
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,400
Rebecca Finkiel.

238
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:01,270
So, I hear you're seeing a certain Rebecca?

239
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:04,080
She's just someone I know.

240
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,000
Just someone you know?

241
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,440
Is she a Yid?
- I didn't ask.

242
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,080
You're really not curious.

243
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,840
You're hurting.
- You're annoying.

244
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,230
Next time,
ask if she's a Yid.

245
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:17,280
All you do is talk about Jews.

246
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,200
I don't want to be Jewish.
Understand?

247
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
They'll catch cold.

248
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,760
Ve have vays of making you tok,
Jewish swine.

249
00:30:05,080 --> 00:30:06,200
What'd you say?

250
00:30:15,080 --> 00:30:18,200
Stay in your seats.
Just stop this.

251
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,720
Calm down.

252
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:25,280
Go back to your seats.

253
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
You beat him up?
- It was Jean-Paul.

254
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,480
He tried to swipe my pen.

255
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,160
Show Louise your eye.
I'd feel better.

256
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:38,360
For a pen?

257
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,320
You really beat him up?

258
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,120
I think I wanted to kill him.

259
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,920
You wanted to kill him?

260
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,800
Didn't you wonder why?

261
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:52,520
I wanted to rub out his face.

262
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,000
Why?

263
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,920
Why?

264
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:38,720
I know why you're crying.

265
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,120
Simon.

266
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:46,520
That year, I would turn 15.

267
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,560
Louise finally told me what I'd always known.

268
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:53,350
Louise, who'd never had children or any true love,

269
00:31:53,450 --> 00:31:56,360
loved me enough to betray my parents' trust.

270
00:31:57,000 --> 00:32:01,400
Since she revealed part of the secret,
she had to tell me more.

271
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:14,640
Simon, what are you up to?
Decided not to eat today?

272
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,800
You should.
Mommy made rutabaga.

273
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,270
You wonder what it is before you eat,

274
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,960
and especially after.

275
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,760
Look, Papa.

276
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,600
He's my son, I decide.
No disguises.

277
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,760
It's no disguise.
What do you mean?

278
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,280
You do what you like

279
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,000
I'm not doing what I like.
We have to.

280
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,040
Maybe you do, but I don't.
Nor does Simon.

281
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:48,640
Get in the house, Fuzzy.
Right this minute.

282
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,480
Come on, Simon.
One hand after the other.

283
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,880
But breathe, don't forget.
Lift your knees.

284
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:56,840
Your knees.
And look up.

285
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,720
Look up, Simon.

286
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:02,160
I am looking up.
- Then why stop?

287
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,510
You're nuts.

288
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:04,640
Look at that.

289
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,280
He just ate.

290
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:08,200
Hannah,
no smoking in the gym.

291
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:09,920
No smoking in the gym.

292
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,400
Come down, you monkey.

293
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:21,190
What she revealed stirred up rage and jealousy

294
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,440
for which I already felt guilty.

295
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:27,600
Dead people emerged whose names
I heard for the first time:

296
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,600
Hannah, Simon.

297
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,680
Where are they now?

298
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:46,760
I'd never again think of myself
as the first, the only one.

299
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,760
Then Louise told me about
the others, Robert and Tania

300
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:55,840
I headed toward unknown faces
along a road of whispers.

301
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:03,040
Everyone knew,
everyone had loved Simon,

302
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,680
and no one had told me.

303
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,150
They'd struck his name from every list.

304
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:15,040
It wasn't on any stone.
It was no longer uttered by anyone.

305
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,560
Stop your bragging.

306
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,920
Why not go get your daughter?

307
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,400
Excuse me.

308
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:51,000
You're Robert,
the bride's brother.

309
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,750
A kiss?

310
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,920
You're Tania, Robert's wife.

311
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:01,680
Mama and Papa?
- They went for the bride.

312
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,520
You drove from Lyon?

313
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:06,560
Had to.
A railroad strike.

314
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:09,760
Just accordion players on the tracks.

315
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:13,840
He wouldn't miss this for Léon Blum, comrade.

316
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:17,080
What did Blum do to you?
- He better not do anything.

317
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,040
You don't mind paid holidays.

318
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,760
Here comes the bride.

319
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:31,840
Your brother made it.
My little girl.

320
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,280
Don't you look lovely.

321
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,560
You look like a flower...
that needs to pee.

322
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:44,880
You're so beautiful.

323
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,480
Robert, my big brother.

324
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:02,390
Finally, the phenomenon.
I've heard so much about you.

325
00:36:02,490 --> 00:36:03,720
Tania, his wife.

326
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:06,800
Kiss each other.
He's family.

327
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,430
Tania's an athlete.

328
00:36:09,530 --> 00:36:11,520
Maybe more athletic than you.

329
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,200
What sport?

330
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:14,630
A little swimming.

331
00:36:14,730 --> 00:36:16,960
A little.
She's a champion.

332
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,400
I married a genuine mermaid.

333
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,560
After work...
into the pool.

334
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,440
We have a fishbowl at home.

335
00:36:23,560 --> 00:36:26,000
The bedding trade in Lyon is fine, but

336
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,080
Before we met, my wife modeled
for Molyneux in Paris.

337
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:33,200
I was just a modeling salesgirl.

338
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:34,720
That's something.

339
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:50,120
Today, Thursday, May 6, 1936.

340
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:54,520
I declare you,
Maxime Nathan Grinberg

341
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,240
and Hannah Golda Stirn,

342
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:00,160
man and wife.

343
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,960
A fine tomcat my sister's married.

344
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:37,280
Too handsome for his own good.

345
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,320
Your wife sure is pretty.

346
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,310
A real yiddishe mama.

347
00:40:14,410 --> 00:40:17,480
A beautiful woman, that's all.

348
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,800
She'll give me lots of children.

349
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,280
Good night, all.

350
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:58,480
You take the rings and suddenly

351
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,840
To separate them,
just snap your fingers.

352
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:14,870
We sell bedroom suites.

353
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:19,040
After closing,
we can go down and choose:

354
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,880
17th century,
Regency, Art Nouveau

355
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:23,680
Plenty of choice.

356
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,160
I think I'm a little

357
00:41:26,280 --> 00:41:28,640
I think you are.
Let's go.

358
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,320
Thanks for everything.

359
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:40,720
See you soon.

360
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,040
Drive safely.

361
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:03,200
Come on.

362
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,120
Wait.
There are still guests.

363
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:14,680
Who cares.

364
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,240
8 pounds, 4 ounces.

365
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:34,680
He's a strong 'un.

366
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:36,160
Like his father.

367
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:42,000
There's not enough light.

368
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:46,480
Darling little Simon...
You're as good-looking as your mom.

369
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:49,280
He has Hannah's mouth,

370
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,520
but his chin is yours.

371
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:54,120
Nonsense.
My son has a determined chin,

372
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,160
not a protruding chin.

373
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:59,710
Let me hold him.
Come here, Simon.

374
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:03,040
He looks like me.
He has the Grinberg chin.

375
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:06,360
Like Esther, like Papa.

376
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,950
Look, darling.

377
00:43:10,050 --> 00:43:13,840
Look, Simon, that's Paris,
the capital of France.

378
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,640
What?
That's a Citroen.

379
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:19,830
That weird thing there?

380
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,400
That's a bicycle.

381
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:29,320
HITLER AND MUSSOLINI MEET
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN VENICE

382
00:43:55,560 --> 00:43:58,520
There they are.
- My dear brother.

383
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,720
How are you?

384
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,720
And you?
Where's this baby?

385
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:10,600
My wonder child?

386
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:14,920
For Simon, from Tania.

387
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:17,200
That's sweet.

388
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,000
Hello, Mr. Grinberg.

389
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:22,120
Stop ogling my wife.

390
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,400
They get along well.

391
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
I bet they're good in bed.

392
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,080
I'm sure they are.

393
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:55,320
You're sure?

394
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:59,040
But not as good as we are.
Impossible.

395
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:20,760
Papa, I'm going to Louise's.

396
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:44,520
I'm listening.

397
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:46,200
I'm looking for music.

398
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,360
Come drink your hot chocolate.

399
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,720
Don't burn yourself.

400
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:56,680
On September 12, Hitler said

401
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,920
that the Germans demand
the right to self-determination.

402
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:19,120
Ten years before me,
Simon had frequented the same places as me,

403
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,550
but unlike me,

404
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:23,880
he indeed saw admiration in his father's eyes.

405
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:34,680
It's rare for a kid to be so athletic. Maybe

406
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:36,630
He'll be an Olympic champion.

407
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:38,680
Why not?

408
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:41,320
A Yid Olympic champ.
That'd show Hitler.

409
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,520
Next week, it's 'Tarzan
and the Swiss Cheese Mines.'

410
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,080
Stop being so overprotective.

411
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,920
I don't feel like smoking.

412
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:19,030
Why the long face?

413
00:47:19,130 --> 00:47:22,200
You sat next to me.
You saw the newsreels.

414
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:24,520
It'll start all over, like before.

415
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:27,960
This is France,
the land of freedom.

416
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,550
What about the Dreyfus Affair?
- What misfortune.

417
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:33,110
Look at your face.

418
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:34,880
What about my face?

419
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,760
It's an 'oy, oy, oy' face.

420
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:39,350
Grampa's funny, huh?

421
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:43,200
What did I do to deserve an anti-Semitic son?

422
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,920
Don't be so confident.
Loads of French hate Jews.

423
00:47:47,040 --> 00:47:49,190
Don't bury your head in the sand.

424
00:47:49,290 --> 00:47:52,560
Hear that?
You married an anti-Semitic ostrich.

425
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,200
D'you love me anyway?

426
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,480
GENERAL MOBILIZATION
FIGHTING ON THE GERMAN-POLISH FRONT

427
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:10,440
That's a cute coat.

428
00:48:13,120 --> 00:48:14,590
A picture of Papa.

429
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:16,150
He's so handsome.

430
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:17,840
See how handsome he is?

431
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,320
There's a letter.

432
00:48:20,320 --> 00:48:23,160
'Dear Nannah,
'There's not much action yet.

433
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,360
'We do maneuvers every day...'

434
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:29,270
'My darling, I write from the Breslau camp in Silesia,

435
00:48:29,370 --> 00:48:32,040
'where I've been a prisoner for three weeks.

436
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,440
'Don't worry, whatever you do.
The conditions are harsh,

437
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:38,280
'but you know I'll pull through.

438
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:43,350
'If you can't manage the store,
feel free to write to Hannah.

439
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:46,430
'Or even leave Lyon and join the family in Paris.

440
00:48:46,530 --> 00:48:48,120
'That would reassure me.'

441
00:48:48,240 --> 00:48:50,640
'... There's a sense of camaraderie.

442
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:54,080
'Simon grows up every day.
I hate to miss it.

443
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:57,920
'When I get back,
we'll return to the pool.'

444
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:38,120
A wasp.

445
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,030
Leave my plate alone.

446
00:49:41,130 --> 00:49:43,480
For what's in it...
Egg without mayo.

447
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:44,710
It's demoralizing.

448
00:49:44,810 --> 00:49:47,400
A wasp.
- You're nuts.

449
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,400
Hannah the magician,

450
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:52,550
can't you conjure up a nice marrowbone steak?

451
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:54,160
No, too hard for me.

452
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,550
What's today's special?

453
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:58,640
Fried gudgeon for everyone?

454
00:49:58,760 --> 00:49:59,840
It's fish.

455
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:01,440
I don't think I like it.

456
00:50:01,560 --> 00:50:04,040
With ration tickets,
could he have a steak?

457
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:08,070
No, only fried fish...
No tickets, just a fishing rod.

458
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,170
So, fried fish?

459
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:10,280
Fried fish.

460
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:13,600
Fish is good for your memory.

461
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:19,160
Where are you off to?

462
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,000
As handsome as ever.

463
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:28,720
You're beautiful, too.
You smell like apples.

464
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,760
How was the trip?
You must be beat.

465
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:37,120
No, I'm alright.

466
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:45,480
How are you?
- Fine.

467
00:50:51,240 --> 00:50:53,640
Any news of Robert?
And the shop?

468
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:56,960
Let her relax.
She'll tell us later.

469
00:50:57,440 --> 00:51:00,200
Tania, rest up, dear,
and eat.

470
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:02,790
But still, any news?

471
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:05,280
A letter, two days ago.

472
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,120
You can read it.
- No, it's your letter.

473
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:09,630
But how's he doing?

474
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:11,160
He doesn't complain.

475
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,120
He says life in the stalag is bearable. He also says

476
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,320
When he gets back,
we'll have a baby.

477
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,240
I think I'll close the shop.

478
00:51:25,360 --> 00:51:26,840
Alone I can't manage.

479
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,960
But I won't stay in Lyon.

480
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:32,960
I have no family there.
I want to be here, with you.

481
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:36,040
My friend Antoinette,
who works at Molyneux's

482
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,080
She says they'll take me back.

483
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:39,680
They take Jews?

484
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:42,200
I never told them I was Jewish.

485
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:43,960
She's right.

486
00:51:44,080 --> 00:51:46,200
Her job is to sell dresses,
not be Jewish.

487
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:49,160
Are we going to the beach?

488
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,360
Right now.
Everyone going?

489
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:54,310
Tania hasn't finished.

490
00:51:54,410 --> 00:51:56,960
Keep her company.
You'll join us later.

491
00:51:59,400 --> 00:52:01,080
Hurry up.

492
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:17,960
It won't work with me.
With other women, maybe.

493
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,040
So stop wasting your time.

494
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:44,680
Hold it a minute.

495
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,160
Good, Simon.

496
00:52:52,120 --> 00:52:53,720
Attaboy.

497
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:58,320
'Maréchal, here we are

498
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,750
'Standing before the savior of France'

499
00:53:02,850 --> 00:53:05,120
There, don't move.

500
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:09,360
There.

501
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,640
Can't I give you a hand?

502
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,080
A present for me?

503
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,160
Today it's for your mama.

504
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:15,760
Tomorrow will I get one?
- Tomorrow.

505
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:19,000
See my star?
I have a star over my heart.

506
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,680
Me too. Louise sewed it on,
but Dad doesn't like it.

507
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,800
Wait up, you two.

508
00:54:26,120 --> 00:54:28,800
What beautiful flowers.
Hello, Joseph.

509
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,080
How are you, pumpkin?

510
00:54:31,800 --> 00:54:32,920
It's not for me.

511
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:36,440
It's for your Mom's birthday.
Let's give it to her.

512
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:41,960
How can I reassure you?
We've been French for years.

513
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:43,360
For them we're just Jews.

514
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,760
These new measures are for
Poles, Hungarians, Czechs... Not us.

515
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:48,310
We don't have the look.

516
00:54:48,410 --> 00:54:49,640
What look?

517
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:53,040
I'm playing host,
they're too busy arguing.

518
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,390
There they go again.

519
00:54:58,490 --> 00:55:00,120
I wanna see the fight.

520
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:03,440
That'll start rumors.

521
00:55:03,560 --> 00:55:07,560
I do what I like.
When I get to work, off it comes.

522
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,120
That's handy.

523
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:11,280
Don't ruin your nice goy suit.

524
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,840
Stop using that word.

525
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,360
Keep arguing,
we're just passing through.

526
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:17,080
Get up, you're not dead.

527
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:28,600
I have a gift for Hannah.

528
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,240
She's in the kitchen.

529
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:32,960
It smells delicious.
What a treat.

530
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:35,320
Help me put the candles on.

531
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:38,920
Happy birthday.

532
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,920
It's just a little trinket.

533
00:55:51,200 --> 00:55:53,590
We're proud to wear this star.

534
00:55:53,690 --> 00:55:55,040
I'm delighted.

535
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:57,840
Nothing to say?
- You didn't hear me.

536
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,920
Use the best crystal.

537
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:01,840
Maxime,
where's the crystal?

538
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,150
Laws are laws.

539
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:06,630
If you don't obey,
you could jeopardize your family.

540
00:56:06,730 --> 00:56:08,670
I don't give a damn.

541
00:56:08,770 --> 00:56:11,680
It's a law for weaklings,
for the herd.

542
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,760
What's he talking about?

543
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,230
He means sheep.

544
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,880
It's a law for Yids,
like Simon, Hannah, and you.

545
00:56:19,600 --> 00:56:23,800
Can anyone tell me why
we should be so proud to be Jewish?

546
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,000
Isy, Sarah.
Welcome, come in.

547
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,430
Isn't my Simon handsome?

548
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:38,320
The handsomest of them all.

549
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,760
The cake looks good.
Almost real.

550
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,080
Wheat or bean flour?

551
00:56:42,200 --> 00:56:43,760
Bean flour, of course.

552
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:46,080
Could you pass me the salad bowl?

553
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:57,600
It's a bowl,
not a family member.

554
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,560
You didn't do it on purpose.

555
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,040
Daddy.
Mommy's crying.

556
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:05,800
What is it, Nannah?

557
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:07,350
She didn't mean to.

558
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:08,760
Just a broken dish.

559
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:12,200
Are you hurt?
Why are you crying?

560
00:57:18,080 --> 00:57:19,520
What's the matter, dear?

561
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:25,120
Why are you crying,
my little Hannah?

562
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:29,360
Did you tell him?
I bet you told him.

563
00:57:29,480 --> 00:57:33,160
That's how it is.
She went with me to get her star.

564
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:36,000
Is that true?

565
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:41,350
Want to forbid her from being Jewish?

566
00:57:41,450 --> 00:57:43,720
If he could...
- Esther, shut up.

567
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,840
Nothing but talk in this house.

568
00:57:46,960 --> 00:57:48,680
Then, let's ban Jews.

569
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:49,840
Enough.

570
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,720
We're leaving, for good.

571
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,560
Isidore, let's go.

572
00:57:54,680 --> 00:57:57,760
You'll answer for this in the World of Truth.

573
00:57:57,880 --> 00:58:00,400
There, no sinner will be absolved.

574
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:49,200
'Once the 40 thieves left,

575
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:52,640
'Ali Baba went to the cave with the treasure

576
00:58:52,920 --> 00:58:55,360
'and spoke the magic words:

577
00:58:55,480 --> 00:58:58,040
Open Sesame.

578
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:02,720
'And the two big doors opened,

579
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,160
'and Ali Baba entered the cave

580
00:59:06,560 --> 00:59:08,440
'and then he said:

581
00:59:08,560 --> 00:59:11,000
''And now, nighty-night'.'

582
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:18,000
They left 'cause you broke the bowl.

583
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,200
You said nothing about your gift.

584
01:00:10,280 --> 01:00:11,880
You didn't even open it.

585
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:30,520
How'd you do it?

586
01:00:34,680 --> 01:00:36,360
You smell nice.

587
01:01:32,920 --> 01:01:34,440
Stop following me.

588
01:01:42,360 --> 01:01:44,390
Stop, fellas. Off the mat.

589
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:45,800
Wrestle.

590
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:53,640
Down.

591
01:02:03,240 --> 01:02:04,640
We went pretty fast.

592
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,350
It's far.
- Yeah. We did at least 20 mph.

593
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:09,280
Is that a lot?
- Not bad.

594
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,440
That's 'cause you're so strong.

595
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:13,680
Hi.
Is it crowded today?

596
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,560
Mr. Maxime

597
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:37,400
NO JEWS

598
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:41,480
It's a village in the Creuse,
a tiny place.

599
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:44,760
St. Gaultier.
A friend of Louise's comes from there.

600
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:47,040
Tilt your head a little.

601
01:02:48,080 --> 01:02:52,040
Cross a border again at my age...
I don't have the gumption.

602
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:56,120
Look at my face,
wrinkled like an accordion.

603
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:00,360
And my little Hannah

604
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:04,640
It won't be easy for her
alone at the shop with the boy.

605
01:03:08,280 --> 01:03:11,400
What is it?
You want to tell me something?

606
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:14,960
Have you ever felt guilty?

607
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,160
Why?

608
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:24,280
Have you ever done something
or wanted something that

609
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,120
I've been a barber all my life.

610
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:31,110
Get both of them down there fast.
Wife and son.

611
01:03:31,210 --> 01:03:32,800
Want some lotion?

612
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:35,600
Sure.

613
01:03:37,160 --> 01:03:40,600
It's women who suffer the most in a war.

614
01:03:41,560 --> 01:03:43,920
Women are the unknown soldier.

615
01:03:44,840 --> 01:03:47,840
And they don't even get a veteran's pension.

616
01:03:50,600 --> 01:03:52,440
Everything was decided fast.

617
01:03:52,560 --> 01:03:56,440
Finding forged papers
and a smuggler wasn't so hard.

618
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,520
At the station, he said?

619
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,960
Georges and Maxime would go first.

620
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:07,960
Esther, Hannah, Louise
and Simon would join them soon.

621
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,360
Tania returned to Lyon to sell her parents' shop.

622
01:04:12,800 --> 01:04:16,760
Once her business was settled,
she hoped to join them.

623
01:04:19,560 --> 01:04:21,600
I'm taking you across.

624
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:44,640
The line's there.

625
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:46,720
Are you sure?
- I should be.

626
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,120
Aren't you hungry?

627
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:54,190
Stop saying that.

628
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:56,640
When I'm hungry,
I repeat myself.

629
01:05:10,560 --> 01:05:12,280
Maxime, right?

630
01:05:14,200 --> 01:05:15,680
Come in.

631
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,000
Mathilde.

632
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:25,680
These are our guests.
This is Mathilde.

633
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:30,040
You must be starved?

634
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:33,840
With the shortages in Paris,
we're used to skimping.

635
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,320
A letter for you.

636
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:46,240
Mommy. A letter.

637
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:50,520
You got a letter?

638
01:05:58,480 --> 01:05:59,950
Nannah darling.

639
01:06:00,050 --> 01:06:02,280
Everything's fine.
It's a great place.

640
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:04,400
Captain Béraud is a fine chap.

641
01:06:05,080 --> 01:06:06,800
These are your rooms.

642
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:10,680
Your little boy can stay here.

643
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:13,640
You're on the next floor, Georges.

644
01:06:14,080 --> 01:06:15,800
Make yourselves at home.

645
01:06:17,920 --> 01:06:20,160
Our bedroom is wonderful.

646
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,360
It has a fine view of the river.

647
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:37,440
The Captain made some contacts for me.

648
01:06:37,880 --> 01:06:39,440
I've found work.

649
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:49,800
Maxime, come look.

650
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:54,600
Georges has discovered country life.

651
01:06:54,720 --> 01:06:56,960
I call him 'The Wheelbarrow King.'

652
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:02,840
St. Gaultier is heaven.

653
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,190
My next letter should instruct you to join us.

654
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:08,440
I'm so looking forward to it.

655
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:14,320
Tell Simon I'm waiting for him to build a tree house.

656
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,360
Have you any news of Robert and Tania?

657
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:39,480
My dear Maxime,
Things at the shop are getting rough.

658
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,990
Customers are scarce now.

659
01:07:42,090 --> 01:07:45,880
Same for my parents.
Same for Louise.

660
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:49,120
Even loyal customers have stopped coming.

661
01:07:49,240 --> 01:07:51,080
We'd rather not know why.

662
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,040
Can I sleep with you?

663
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,400
Why aren't you asleep?

664
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:59,160
Because I want to sleep with you.

665
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:03,680
I want Daddy's pillow and for you to do magic tricks.

666
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:13,200
Simon looks more and more like you.

667
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:15,320
I look at him, and I see you.

668
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:21,040
The way you knit your brow
and sleep with clenched fists.

669
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:27,030
Maxime, my man.

670
01:08:27,130 --> 01:08:29,600
I miss you so.
You're my whole life.

671
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:33,320
In a few days,
we'll be sharing a bed again.

672
01:08:33,440 --> 01:08:36,960
You asked if I'd heard from my brother. I haven't.

673
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:42,080
I so wish Robert would come home
so Tania could be with her husband.

674
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,040
IT IS FORBIDDEN TO BREAK THE SEALS

675
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:29,920
You scared me.

676
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:42,440
I want Maxime.

677
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:57,120
Denise Lambert, Germaine Lambert,
Marie-Louise Mercier.

678
01:09:57,240 --> 01:09:59,480
Aren't those good French names?

679
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:02,360
And you're Charles Mercier.
Like that?

680
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,320
I like Simon Grinberg better.

681
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:07,160
Sure,
that'll always be your name.

682
01:10:07,280 --> 01:10:09,830
'Charles' is just to go see Daddy.

683
01:10:09,930 --> 01:10:11,440
I'm taking the train.

684
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:15,440
Maxime was right: We shouldn't have registered.

685
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,640
And these,
do we throw them out?

686
01:10:19,160 --> 01:10:21,120
Anyway, that's it for me.

687
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:22,880
Me, too.

688
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:25,680
And this, too,
done with.

689
01:10:29,440 --> 01:10:32,520
That's it, Nannah,
everything's ready.

690
01:10:32,640 --> 01:10:36,480
The river will help you forget
the anxiety and hardships.

691
01:10:36,600 --> 01:10:38,040
Grab this.

692
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:46,270
Tania arrived yesterday.

693
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:50,200
With you, Simon and Esther,
the family will be together.

694
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:12,160
Everyone's there now.

695
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:20,240
When I said I had no news
from my husband, they sneered.

696
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,470
They only handle requests after 8 months' captivity.

697
01:11:23,570 --> 01:11:27,640
In '17, I was a prisoner
in the Ruhr, my fiancée was here.

698
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,120
She got my letters every Thursday without fail.

699
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:34,360
They treated prisoners decently then.

700
01:11:34,840 --> 01:11:36,950
Did you see The Grand Illusion?

701
01:11:37,050 --> 01:11:38,990
Esther did.
She sees everything.

702
01:11:39,090 --> 01:11:42,470
She told me about it.
With Gabin, Fresnay and Dalio.

703
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:45,040
And Von Stroheim... Terrific.

704
01:11:45,520 --> 01:11:48,440
They say he's not a Kraut.
I'm not surprised.

705
01:11:53,960 --> 01:11:56,320
See you tomorrow.

706
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:13,200
What sweaters do I pack for him?

707
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,480
Would you behave?

708
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:21,720
Can't you hear me yelling?

709
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:24,200
What sweaters do I pack?
The jacquards?

710
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:35,680
All set?
Do we have everything?

711
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:37,400
Let's move it, girls.

712
01:12:39,680 --> 01:12:41,600
Simon and I are staying.

713
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:45,000
I'm not going.

714
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:49,960
I have to wait for Mama and Papa.
They can't get in, with the seals.

715
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:53,880
If Robert comes home wounded,
I have to tend to him.

716
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,030
It's better if we stay.

717
01:12:57,130 --> 01:13:00,720
No, I want to go on the train and build tree houses.

718
01:13:00,840 --> 01:13:02,880
And don't smoke in the gym.

719
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:18,360
Look up.
How do you expect me to get it?

720
01:13:22,080 --> 01:13:24,840
Look up.
- I am looking up.

721
01:13:29,560 --> 01:13:31,440
There, don't move.

722
01:13:38,520 --> 01:13:40,000
What got in my eye?

723
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,400
Nothing.
Just a bit of grit.

724
01:14:13,680 --> 01:14:14,680
No one here?

725
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,680
Then I'm sitting down.

726
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:37,480
Are you the Parisians?

727
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:39,120
Get in quick.

728
01:14:55,600 --> 01:14:58,240
The Demarcation Line was 1 mile away.

729
01:14:58,840 --> 01:15:02,240
They had to wait for nightfall.
Act like strangers.

730
01:15:08,720 --> 01:15:12,920
Day after day, in episodes,
Louise had told me everything.

731
01:15:14,840 --> 01:15:19,000
All they'd told her,
all they'd been through together.

732
01:15:19,120 --> 01:15:21,520
Everything,
but the main thing

733
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:39,120
Here, have some cheese. Eat.

734
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:42,080
A diabolo mint for the doggie?

735
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:44,320
He doesn't drink diabolo mint.

736
01:15:45,320 --> 01:15:47,160
Still nothing for your mom?

737
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:53,280
Easy.
Why drink so fast?

738
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:55,840
I have to pee.

739
01:15:57,800 --> 01:16:00,600
I can go by myself.
I'm not a baby.

740
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:18,560
'Evening, Antoine.

741
01:16:18,680 --> 01:16:19,910
'Evening, Lucien.

742
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:21,120
How's it going?

743
01:16:22,560 --> 01:16:25,120
'Evening, ladies.
Your papers, please.

744
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:54,480
Your papers, please.

745
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:12,840
JEWISH

746
01:17:42,200 --> 01:17:43,640
That's my son.

747
01:19:52,520 --> 01:19:53,920
Esther.

748
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:21,240
Louise chose to say
Hannah had been careless, she'd blundered.

749
01:20:21,360 --> 01:20:25,200
She couldn't bear to mention
a possibly deliberate act.

750
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:28,830
Even less so,
Hannah's three words

751
01:20:28,930 --> 01:20:31,280
that had been Simon's undoing.

752
01:21:19,240 --> 01:21:21,120
He told me to take this.

753
01:21:21,480 --> 01:21:24,560
Should I throw it away?
- Of course not.

754
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:29,440
They'll come back.

755
01:22:27,560 --> 01:22:29,720
They must be in a transit camp.

756
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,760
There's one in Pithiviers.

757
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:37,160
And Beaune-la-Rolande.
Maybe they'll meet people we know.

758
01:23:14,600 --> 01:23:17,040
The transit camps are only one stage.

759
01:23:18,360 --> 01:23:20,240
But towards what

760
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,440
There's talk of concentration camps in Germany,

761
01:23:24,880 --> 01:23:28,000
prison camps for resistance fighters and Jews.

762
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:32,280
I doubt women and children are treated well.

763
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:44,760
See what Brasillach wrote about the Jews?

764
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,600
'Mop all that up.
Don't forget the children.'

765
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:17,070
I'm not imagining things.
Their gazes are like touching.

766
01:25:17,170 --> 01:25:18,170
Oh, come on.

767
01:25:18,250 --> 01:25:21,240
They haven't done anything wrong.

768
01:25:21,360 --> 01:25:25,080
Maybe, but it always seems
they just have, or they will.

769
01:25:25,200 --> 01:25:26,600
Esther, please.

770
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:29,320
You're the one who wrote Tania in Lyon.

771
01:25:29,440 --> 01:25:32,440
That's right, lady,
you gave her the address.

772
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:07,440
Some butter, children.
The real thing.

773
01:26:29,600 --> 01:26:30,920
Could you take this?

774
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,190
Do I just count the meat and wine?

775
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:38,920
The eggs and vegetables are free, right?

776
01:26:40,360 --> 01:26:42,240
Thanks to Georges' work.

777
01:26:43,280 --> 01:26:45,760
He doesn't push the barrow he sleeps in it.

778
01:26:51,720 --> 01:26:55,360
No, that's not right.
I hate math. If Hannah were here

779
01:26:55,480 --> 01:26:56,800
Oh, stop it.

780
01:26:56,920 --> 01:27:01,560
Cut the 'poor Hannah' act.
You sure you want her to come back?

781
01:27:12,200 --> 01:27:14,400
Well?
Doesn't it make you sick?

782
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,760
I've seen worse.

783
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:21,440
You say that because you also...
- Go on, say it.

784
01:27:21,920 --> 01:27:24,070
I also think Tania's desirable?

785
01:27:24,170 --> 01:27:26,680
It's true.
She's beautiful and desirable.

786
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:28,320
So you excuse them?

787
01:27:28,760 --> 01:27:31,560
No, I just don't judge them.
- Great.

788
01:27:31,680 --> 01:27:35,120
How lofty of you.
Well, I'm much lower than you.

789
01:27:38,040 --> 01:27:39,320
Ever think of Hannah?

790
01:27:40,360 --> 01:27:44,150
All the time.
And I don't judge her either.

791
01:27:44,250 --> 01:27:45,800
I try not to.

792
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,240
Give me a cigarette.

793
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:07,440
This morning, I thought about what we'd cook:

794
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,000
Fish or chicken.

795
01:28:09,120 --> 01:28:13,960
And I said to myself: Not fish.
Simon doesn't like fish.

796
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:18,880
How stupid of me to send Tania here.

797
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:21,000
When I see them

798
01:28:22,320 --> 01:28:25,760
I'm not religious,
but I remember the rabbi's words:

799
01:28:26,480 --> 01:28:29,360
'Without the Torah,
a marriage is nothing.'

800
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:31,480
I feel outraged, understand?

801
01:28:32,200 --> 01:28:33,910
Sure, I understand.

802
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:35,440
But you don't agree.

803
01:28:36,360 --> 01:28:38,360
Where will it get us?

804
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:40,000
To be outraged.
There.

805
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:42,360
So we're outraged.
All our life.

806
01:28:42,800 --> 01:28:45,560
It'll devour us and poison everyone else.

807
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:48,760
What do we do?
I don't know what to think.

808
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:54,760
We think about Hannah and Simon.
We hope.

809
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:57,040
And continue to make dinner.

810
01:33:12,680 --> 01:33:15,160
I'd never seen my father so upset.

811
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:17,720
Mom tell you about the dog?

812
01:33:18,840 --> 01:33:19,920
Yes.

813
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:22,080
I took care of it.

814
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:24,360
I went by the shop.

815
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,880
He'd gotten over Hannah and Simon.

816
01:33:29,520 --> 01:33:31,920
But his dog's death crushed him.

817
01:33:36,080 --> 01:33:37,560
How was Tania?

818
01:33:40,040 --> 01:33:41,720
Worried about you.

819
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:51,480
Soon after returning to Paris.

820
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,680
Tania learned Robert had died
of typhus in the stalag.

821
01:33:56,280 --> 01:33:59,080
She barely mourned him.
He was so far away.

822
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:38,080
Maxime now knows Simon, Hannah
and her parents were deported.

823
01:34:42,480 --> 01:34:46,000
He can no longer imagine them
as prisoners or exiles.

824
01:34:55,240 --> 01:34:56,680
No news of them.

825
01:35:16,280 --> 01:35:17,960
Want us to call it off?

826
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:22,280
I don't know.

827
01:35:23,000 --> 01:35:24,510
I don't know anymore.

828
01:35:24,610 --> 01:35:26,400
You don't know anymore?

829
01:35:30,200 --> 01:35:31,760
I know.

830
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:35,880
We'll call it off.

831
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:40,120
Even if they don't return, it's over.

832
01:35:41,120 --> 01:35:42,640
For good.

833
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,680
4 pounds, 8 ounces.
Not much.

834
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,040
It's a little baby.

835
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:02,840
It's very pretty, Esther.
Thanks.

836
01:36:04,720 --> 01:36:07,400
Move over,
I can't see the baby.

837
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:11,760
He should grow up fast,
I'm getting some nice merchandise.

838
01:36:11,880 --> 01:36:13,440
For a change.

839
01:36:14,040 --> 01:36:17,280
Can I hold him?
- The doctor says he's too frail.

840
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:19,640
I'm not contagious, you know.

841
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:29,560
Are you OK?

842
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:31,320
I'm glad you came.

843
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:34,550
It's your life, Maxime.

844
01:36:34,650 --> 01:36:36,120
And Tania's.

845
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,000
And now it's going to be his.

846
01:36:45,240 --> 01:36:48,240
It took them time to imagine a life together,

847
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:51,400
but they finally married and worked together.

848
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:58,870
They never again spoke of the war or the deceased.

849
01:36:58,970 --> 01:37:01,440
They changed the spelling of our name.

850
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:06,360
Now I could name them,
the ghosts relaxed their grip.

851
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:11,590
Gradually they became allies in my attempt

852
01:37:11,690 --> 01:37:14,200
to extract my patients from the dark.

853
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:21,800
PARIS - SERGE KLARSFELD'S OFFICE

854
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:30,600
Grinberg, Hannah Golda, née Stirn,
and Simon Grinberg, is that right?

855
01:37:35,000 --> 01:37:39,200
'August 10 to 17, 1942:
A week at Pithiviers transit camp.

856
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:41,960
'The 18th, sent to Poland,
Auschwitz.

857
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:46,160
'Gassed the day after arrival,
the 19th.'

858
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,880
Who's Simon Grinberg to you?

859
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,520
I'm his brother.

860
01:38:03,840 --> 01:38:06,040
And I thought

861
01:38:06,160 --> 01:38:09,360
You're preparing a book on deported children.

862
01:38:12,280 --> 01:38:14,360
I brought this photo.

863
01:38:35,840 --> 01:38:37,600
He didn't die right away.

864
01:38:41,080 --> 01:38:42,760
He must have suffered.

865
01:38:47,720 --> 01:38:49,000
It's all my fault.

866
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:17,110
I said yes, he was to blame for his dog's death,

867
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:18,640
but for that alone.

868
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:25,040
I told him what Serge Klarsfeld had found:

869
01:39:25,160 --> 01:39:28,320
the transport train,
the departure for Auschwitz,

870
01:39:28,440 --> 01:39:30,400
their death the next morning.

871
01:39:32,000 --> 01:39:34,880
They didn't suffer the camp's daily horror.

872
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,760
Only Nazi hatred was to blame for their death.

873
01:39:40,640 --> 01:39:43,240
I hoped I'd freed them of their secret.

874
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:59,840
A few years later, Mother lost
the ability to speak or walk

875
01:39:59,960 --> 01:40:02,160
after a stroke.

876
01:40:03,680 --> 01:40:05,960
My father faced up at first,

877
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:10,360
but the sight of his paralyzed champion
became too much for him,

878
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:12,440
and they decided to end it.

879
01:40:26,800 --> 01:40:29,590
One June evening,
I took my daughter, Rose,

880
01:40:29,690 --> 01:40:33,000
to see an abandoned chateau near our house.

881
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:36,840
A village elder had given me its owner's name:

882
01:40:36,960 --> 01:40:40,200
Josée de Chambrun,
daughter of President Laval.

883
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,680
This is weird. What is it?

884
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,120
Looks like a little cemetery.

885
01:40:47,080 --> 01:40:50,520
'Barye,' 'Pompey'...
It's not a cemetery for people.

886
01:40:54,040 --> 01:40:55,520
More like for dogs.

887
01:40:56,240 --> 01:40:57,720
And cats, too?

888
01:40:58,120 --> 01:40:59,480
Maybe.

889
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:02,160
'Brutus, 1908.'

890
01:41:04,360 --> 01:41:06,000
These dogs are old.

891
01:41:12,080 --> 01:41:13,440
What a dumb name.

892
01:41:15,560 --> 01:41:19,720
'Vasco, 1979-1985.'

893
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:22,920
'Dying was all he ever did wrong.'

894
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:26,240
They must have loved their dogs.

895
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:30,510
Rose. François.

896
01:41:30,610 --> 01:41:32,200
We're coming, Mommy.

897
01:41:34,120 --> 01:41:36,160
You coming?

898
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:44,870
In that cemetery, lovingly kept
by the daughter of Laval,

899
01:41:44,970 --> 01:41:48,670
who had sent Simon, Hannah
and all the others to their death.

900
01:41:48,770 --> 01:41:50,880
I thought of telling our story

901
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:54,040
so we would at last emerge from the silence.

902
01:41:58,360 --> 01:41:59,800
Brutus

903
01:42:00,800 --> 01:42:02,280
Pompey

904
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:05,600
Madou

905
01:42:07,240 --> 01:42:08,720
Soko

906
01:42:11,080 --> 01:42:12,560
Vasco

907
01:42:14,440 --> 01:42:15,880
Sarah

908
01:42:18,640 --> 01:42:20,080
Nathan

909
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:23,920
Rebecca

910
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:27,360

911

Misha

912
