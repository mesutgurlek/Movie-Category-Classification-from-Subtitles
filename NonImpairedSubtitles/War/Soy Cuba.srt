23
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:36,072
Once, Christopher Columbus
landed here.

24
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:40,271
He wrote in his diary:

25
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:45,709
"This is the most beautiful land...

26
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:49,879
ever seen by human eyes."

27
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:54,716
Thank you, Señor Columbus.

28
00:04:58,464 --> 00:05:03,959
When you saw me
for the first time...

29
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:09,337
I was singing and laughing.

30
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:15,504
I waved the fronds of my palms
to greet your sails.

31
00:05:15,615 --> 00:05:20,712
I thought your ships
brought happiness.

32
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:32,186
I am Cuba.

33
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:40,973
Ships took my sugar.

34
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:48,770
And left me tears.

35
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:57,418
Strange thing, sugar,
Señor Columbus.

36
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:03,291
It contains so many tears...

37
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:06,797
and yet it is sweet.

38
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,017
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
this is the moment of truth.

39
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,211
The voting depends on you!

40
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:04,312
We ask that you give a big hand
to our beauties.

41
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:06,324
Ladies and gentlemen.
Louder.

42
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:08,690
Another big hand.
Louder, louder!

43
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:10,695
Ladies and gentlemen!

44
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:38,671
Crazy love

45
00:09:38,778 --> 00:09:43,715
Crazy love

46
00:09:45,785 --> 00:09:50,222
This crazy love

47
00:09:53,693 --> 00:09:56,025
In my blood

48
00:09:58,497 --> 00:10:04,993
She loves me

49
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:13,409
I can't live anymore
without your love

50
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:17,243
Crazy love

51
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,912
This crazy love

52
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,682
The love

53
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:36,428
Of my life

54
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:46,602
I can't live anymore
without your love

55
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:55,611
It's crazy love

56
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,749
That my heart

57
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:06,127
Feels for you

58
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:11,563
Take, take

59
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,767
All my love

60
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:27,115
My sweet little love

61
00:11:28,821 --> 00:11:37,525
I can't live anymore
without your love

62
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:42,124
Crazy love

63
00:11:42,234 --> 00:11:48,730
Crazy love

64
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:52,641
I am

65
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,511
I am

66
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:59,709
Love crazy, crazy

67
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:01,844
I am crazy for your love

68
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:51,950
Crazy love
Love crazy

69
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:57,256
Crazy is the love
I feel for you

70
00:14:59,198 --> 00:15:03,658
Crazy, crazy, crazy
for your love

71
00:15:05,704 --> 00:15:10,141
Crazy, crazy
for your love

72
00:15:57,389 --> 00:15:59,949
Bob, that's indecent.

73
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:01,720
Ah, nuts!

74
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,818
Nothing's indecent in Cuba
if you've got the dough!

75
00:17:44,329 --> 00:17:44,727
- Good morning, René.
- How are you, señora?

76
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:51,766
So, so. This heat.

77
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:53,269
Thank you.

78
00:17:54,907 --> 00:18:01,938
Oranges, white pineapples

79
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:08,680
California plums
Nice juicy pears, cheap

80
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,060
- How's business, René?
- Fine, fine.

81
00:18:18,163 --> 00:18:19,596
How are you doing?

82
00:18:19,698 --> 00:18:22,599
You've come to keep him company?

83
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:25,636
Got any fruit for me?

84
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,533
I do, the best.

85
00:18:30,642 --> 00:18:33,805
You see, this is what
I was telling you about.

86
00:18:38,917 --> 00:18:41,385
I think I'm gonna become
a fruit seller too.

87
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:48,082
- Well, see you later.
- Okay, man, see you.

88
00:18:53,031 --> 00:18:54,931
Who was that?

89
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,933
Regular customers.

90
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,071
I'm afraid, René.

91
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:04,165
You don't have to be afraid
of anything.

92
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,897
Look.

93
00:19:35,073 --> 00:19:36,301
Look.

94
00:19:36,408 --> 00:19:39,309
We're going to be married
in that church.

95
00:19:40,812 --> 00:19:44,475
And you'll be wearing
a white dress.

96
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,881
A white dress.

97
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:04,268
You've never kissed anyone,
have you?

98
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:09,136
Listen, I'll bring you fruit
every day at your job. You want it?

99
00:20:11,176 --> 00:20:13,872
How come you don't tell me
where you work?

100
00:20:16,448 --> 00:20:19,747
Too bad I don't sell flowers.

101
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:25,084
I would give all my flowers to you.

102
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,216
I love you, Maria!

103
00:21:31,657 --> 00:21:36,026
Fellows,
I'd like you to meet... Betty.

104
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:51,039
Look at that,
she brings her own tangerine.

105
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:18,655
Interesting.

106
00:28:18,763 --> 00:28:22,255
No, it's not interesting, señor.

107
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:24,335
Taxi!

108
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:22,532
Mister, mister! Money!
One coin, please!

109
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:26,007
Money.

110
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:29,546
Mister, mister! Money!

111
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:57,897
One coin, please!

112
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:15,716
I am Cuba.

113
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,884
Why are you running away?

114
00:39:21,992 --> 00:39:24,984
You came to have fun.

115
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:28,429
Go ahead, have fun!

116
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:32,491
Isn't this a happy picture?

117
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:37,438
Don't avert your eyes.
Look!

118
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:40,339
I am Cuba.

119
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:44,039
For you, I am the casino,
the bar...

120
00:39:44,148 --> 00:39:47,413
the hotels and brothels.

121
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:51,420
But the hands of these children
and old people are also me.

122
00:39:51,522 --> 00:39:53,183
I am Cuba.

123
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:53,349
I hoped and prayed
you would be ready in time.

124
00:45:53,450 --> 00:45:57,386
I've helped you.
Now you help me.

125
00:45:57,488 --> 00:46:00,821
Grow tall, taller than me.

126
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:04,621
Before, I used to think
that the most frightening thing...

127
00:46:04,728 --> 00:46:08,164
in this world would be death.

128
00:46:08,265 --> 00:46:10,426
Now I know better.

129
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:14,732
In life, the most frightening
thing is... life.

130
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:18,239
I am so worried about my children.

131
00:46:18,342 --> 00:46:23,177
All my life I have worked
and have lived in debt.

132
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:30,182
Grow tall, sugarcane.

133
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,517
Not for me.

134
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:34,853
For them.

135
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:39,588
You hear me? Grow tall.

136
00:46:39,696 --> 00:46:41,721
Taller.

137
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:33,955
Papa, it's Señor Acosta.

138
00:52:13,663 --> 00:52:17,030
Busy working, Pedro?

139
00:52:17,134 --> 00:52:18,692
Yeah, working.

140
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:22,533
Well, soon you'll be able
to take a little rest.

141
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:26,871
I've sold these lands
to the United Fruit Company.

142
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:35,015
What about my sugarcane?

143
00:52:35,118 --> 00:52:38,554
You raised it on my land!

144
00:52:38,655 --> 00:52:41,419
But I worked it with my own sweat.

145
00:52:41,525 --> 00:52:44,517
I give that sweat to you...
as a gift.

146
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,629
What about my house?

147
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:52,600
Your house
isn't your house anymore.

148
00:52:52,702 --> 00:52:55,296
Have you forgotten
this little piece of paper?

149
00:52:56,406 --> 00:53:01,309
You can't forge
a signature like that.

150
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:23,957
No, you can't forge
a signature like that.

151
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:28,796
Pedro...

152
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:35,627
your house isn't yours anymore.

153
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:42,242
Your house isn't yours anymore.

154
00:54:45,749 --> 00:54:50,914
I've sold these lands
to United Fruit.

155
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:55,415
I've sold these lands
to United Fruit.

156
00:54:55,525 --> 00:55:02,089
You grew your sugarcane
on my land.

157
00:55:02,198 --> 00:55:07,500
Your house isn't yours anymore.

158
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:19,710
Why did they come, Papa?

159
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:36,162
What happened?

160
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,962
Nothing important.

161
00:55:47,077 --> 00:55:52,140
Why are you standing like a pole?
We need to get back to work.

162
00:56:31,855 --> 00:56:35,689
Papa, are you tired?

163
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:39,193
Papa, are you tired?

164
00:56:41,631 --> 00:56:43,223
I am not tired.

165
00:56:43,333 --> 00:56:44,925
I am not tired!

166
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:47,434
I am not tired!

167
00:56:48,872 --> 00:56:51,102
I am not tired!

168
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:48,060
Today has been a wonderful day.
Just great!

169
00:57:48,164 --> 00:57:50,860
You can go to the village today.

170
00:57:52,435 --> 00:57:57,498
Have some fun. Why don't you
go dancing, listen to music?

171
00:57:57,607 --> 00:58:00,337
Really, Papa? Really?

172
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:02,741
But what about you?

173
00:58:02,846 --> 00:58:07,283
I am too old.
Music was made for the young.

174
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:10,784
You're not old, Papa.

175
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:14,956
Go on.

176
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:17,549
Here, take this, Pablo.

177
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:26,768
But this is your last peso, Papa.

178
00:58:26,870 --> 00:58:31,637
Today it's the last one,
but soon we'll have lots of money.

179
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:42,412
Don't you see how much money
there is here?

180
00:58:50,927 --> 00:58:55,023
Don't you see how much money
there is here?

181
00:58:56,866 --> 00:59:00,734
Don't you see how much money
there is here?

182
00:59:47,050 --> 00:59:49,211
Two Coca-Colas.

183
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,581
Give me some money.

184
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:45,866
Let's go, my guajira

185
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:47,943
Let's go to Havana

186
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:50,205
Let's go, my guajira

187
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,611
Let's go to the city

188
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:57,118
I like parties, rooster fights
my hammock and my shack

189
01:00:57,220 --> 01:01:01,657
I like the curve of your waist

190
01:01:01,758 --> 01:01:06,491
I like the way your hips move
my sweet

191
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:08,996
Let's go, my guajira

192
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:11,225
Let's go to Havana

193
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,598
Let's go, my guajira

194
01:01:13,703 --> 01:01:15,933
Let's go to the city

195
01:01:16,039 --> 01:01:20,305
The sway of your hips has
the wonderful flavor of ripe fruit

196
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:25,177
So does the twist of your body

197
01:01:25,281 --> 01:01:29,274
Prepare the saddle
and mount the rhythm

198
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:32,987
Beat the drums

199
01:01:33,089 --> 01:01:37,048
Look over there, Pancho!
Aren't those old Pedro's children?

200
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:41,153
Looks as if their business
is doing well.

201
01:01:41,264 --> 01:01:43,494
Beat the drums

202
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,760
Swing that body

203
01:01:45,868 --> 01:01:49,099
Watch her move

204
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:51,298
It's the greatest

205
01:01:51,407 --> 01:01:53,671
Move your feet

206
01:01:53,776 --> 01:01:55,903
Beat the drums

207
01:05:08,938 --> 01:05:13,466
I am Cuba.

208
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:16,636
Sometimes it seems to me...

209
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:20,204
that the sap of my palm trees
are full of blood.

210
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:25,520
Sometimes it seems to me
that the murmuring sounds...

211
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:28,112
around us are not the ocean...

212
01:05:28,224 --> 01:05:30,886
but choked-back tears.

213
01:05:33,329 --> 01:05:36,730
Who answers for this blood?

214
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:41,834
Who is responsible
for these tears?

215
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:42,404
General Fulgencio Batista...

216
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:51,508
honorable president of the republic,
receives an award.

217
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:13,216
I'm going to turn off.

218
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:16,550
Let's part here.

219
01:08:21,897 --> 01:08:24,058
See you tomorrow.

220
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:29,135
Hold on.

221
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:39,043
- What?
- I was thinking.

222
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:42,845
Maybe it's better not
to spend the night at home.

223
01:08:42,952 --> 01:08:44,351
Okay.
