in the summer of 1941,

the United States would be drawn

in Alabama,

00:00:47,447 --> 00:00:52,047
a 16-year-old high school boy
named Glenn Dowling Frazier

that the girl he loved

Frazier was so angry and upset

12
00:01:02,647 --> 00:01:06,007
that when the owner of a
juke joint refused him service,

13
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:10,967
he stalked outside,
climbed onto his motorcycle,

14
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,727
and roared through the door,

15
00:01:12,727 --> 00:01:15,844
shattering bottles
and smashing furniture.

16
00:01:17,087 --> 00:01:19,127
As he raced away,

17
00:01:19,127 --> 00:01:23,359
the bar owner chased him
down the street with a shotgun.

18

The next morning,
humiliated, scared,

19
00:01:27,967 --> 00:01:30,527
and unable to face his parents,

20
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:33,967
Glenn Frazier went to
the nearest recruiting office,

21

lied about his age,
and joined the peacetime army.

in the Philippines.

23

FRAZIER: When I volunteered
for the Philippine Islands,

24
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:52,247
I had no idea that we would
actually be at a war.

25
00:01:52,247 --> 00:01:55,447
I was thinking
that probably Germany was

26
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:57,847
the most likely place
that there would be a war,

27
00:01:57,847 --> 00:02:01,127

safe over there.

desperate hand-to-hand combat,

32
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:20,847
a forced march so brutal
the world would never forget it,

him would be told he was dead.

I don't think there is
such a thing as a good war.

There are sometimes
necessary wars.

NARRATOR: The greatest cataclysm
in history grew

49
00:03:31,647 --> 00:03:36,047
out of ancient
and ordinary human emotions -

50
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:39,487
anger and arrogance and bigotry,

courage and perseverance

The Second World War brought out
the best and the worst

in a generation,
and blurred the two

almost indistinguishable.

In the killing that engulfed
the world from 1939 to 1945,

of those who perished

the United States would be the
most powerful nation on earth

They go to war

from the Dust Bowl,

159
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,367
still camped on the edge
of town.

160
00:11:57,367 --> 00:12:00,047
And worked the fields
and orchards and vineyards

161
00:12:00,047 --> 00:12:02,167
of the surrounding
Sacramento Valley.

162
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:06,247
The city had been the gateway
to the California gold rush,

163
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:10,567
and the western anchor of
the transcontinental railroad.

164
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:15,407
Although it was home
to some 106,000 people,

165
00:12:15,407 --> 00:12:18,887
Sacramento still seemed
like a small town.

166
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:21,887
Tom and Earl Burke,

167
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:25,407
who would be asked to sacrifice
everything for their country,

168
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:30,047
lived with their parents
at 3240 Lassen Way,

169
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:32,727
just north of town.

170
00:12:32,727 --> 00:12:36,167
EARL: It was a tremendous town,
everybody knew each other.

171
00:12:36,167 --> 00:12:38,847
All, all ethnic groups were
just perfect.

172
00:12:38,847 --> 00:12:42,247
I mean it was, you, you could go
out on the streets at night

173
00:12:42,247 --> 00:12:43,887
at 11:00, 12:00 at night

174
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:46,367
and, you know, you could
walk home in the dark.

175
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:48,047
Nobody locked the doors.

176
00:12:48,047 --> 00:12:50,207
Nobody even thought of it.

177
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:54,247
It was a, a nice, clean,
little town.

178
00:12:54,247 --> 00:12:59,607
BURNETT MILLER: The lower end
of town was rather colourful to us.

179
00:12:59,607 --> 00:13:02,967
There were lots of whorehouses.

180
00:13:02,967 --> 00:13:05,967
As you got up towards
the nicer part of town,

181
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:08,647
towards Tenth Street, uh,

182
00:13:08,647 --> 00:13:12,127
the houses of prostitution
were quite fancy.

183
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:16,447
And, as kids,
we used to run down there

184
00:13:16,447 --> 00:13:20,042
and run through the place,
just raising hell.

185
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:26,647
NARRATOR: 18-year-old Burnett Miller
lived with his family

186
00:13:26,647 --> 00:13:31,721
in a comfortable neighbourhood
at 3643 West Lincoln Avenue.

187
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:37,487
He would discover,
in the last days of the war,

188
00:13:37,487 --> 00:13:41,002
why it had to be fought.

189
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:47,047
Almost 7,000 Japanese-Americans
also lived in Sacramento

190
00:13:47,047 --> 00:13:48,799
and the surrounding county.

191
00:13:52,007 --> 00:13:57,007
Doctors, lawyers, teachers
and shop owners,

192
00:13:57,007 --> 00:14:01,080
as well as some of the most
productive farmers in America.

193
00:14:03,367 --> 00:14:07,247
Susumu Satow and his family grew
strawberries, grapes

194
00:14:07,247 --> 00:14:11,727
and raspberries on their
20-acre farm, east of the city.

195
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,447
SUSUMU SATOW:
My mother didn't speak English.

196
00:14:13,447 --> 00:14:18,047
My father spoke, uh,
broken English.

197
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:22,327
As a youngster, uh, at age
about eight, nine, I guess,

198
00:14:22,327 --> 00:14:26,687
I used to walk down the railroad
track to a place called Mills.

199
00:14:26,687 --> 00:14:29,884
And Mills had a semipro
baseball team.

200
00:14:31,527 --> 00:14:37,318
And so I grew up in sort of a
baseball environment, I guess.

201
00:14:47,207 --> 00:14:48,767
NARRATOR: In Waterbury,
Connecticut,

202
00:14:48,767 --> 00:14:50,767
on the banks
of the Naugatuck River,

203
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:52,767
a skilled work force,

204
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:55,167
mostly immigrants
and immigrants' children,

205
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:58,287
turned out screws and washers
and buttons,

206
00:14:58,287 --> 00:15:00,447
showerheads and alarm clocks,

207
00:15:00,447 --> 00:15:02,847
toy airplanes
and lipstick holders,

208
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:04,847
and cocktail shakers.

209
00:15:04,847 --> 00:15:07,487
Since the 19th century,

210
00:15:07,487 --> 00:15:11,400
its citizens had proudly called
their town "Brass City".

211
00:15:15,647 --> 00:15:19,647
Ray Leopold, the son of a Jewish
immigrant from Latvia,

212
00:15:19,647 --> 00:15:23,767
lived on Route Eight on
the southern edge of the city.

213
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:29,247
Waterbury was a centre
for high quality craft.

214
00:15:29,247 --> 00:15:34,327
Uh, there were individuals there who
could do one-ten thousandth of an inch

215
00:15:34,327 --> 00:15:39,327
on anything and if there was
zero tolerance required,

216
00:15:39,327 --> 00:15:40,807
they could do that, too.

217
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:44,167
OLGA CIARLO:
Well, Waterbury, where we lived,

218
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,767
there were a lot
of Italian people.

219
00:15:46,767 --> 00:15:49,847
They had made a good business
for themselves

220
00:15:49,847 --> 00:15:51,847
and were very well liked.

221
00:15:51,847 --> 00:15:55,527
We had a wonderful neighbourhood.

222
00:15:55,527 --> 00:15:58,687
We had parties
every single Sunday.

223
00:15:58,687 --> 00:16:01,565
Every Sunday was a picnic
for us.

224
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:06,727
NARRATOR: The Ciarlo family lived
at 1032 North Main Street,

225
00:16:06,727 --> 00:16:08,683
in the Italian section of town.

226
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:14,487
Their father had recently died.

227
00:16:14,487 --> 00:16:19,561
His loss would be only
the beginning of their troubles.

228
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:27,487
And in Mobile, Alabama,

229
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:30,447
population 112,000,

230
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:33,967
the only real industry
was shipbuilding,

231
00:16:33,967 --> 00:16:37,647
as it had been since the
Great War, a generation earlier.

232
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:41,927
Once a centre of cotton
and slave trading,

233
00:16:41,927 --> 00:16:45,687
Mobile was best known
for its annual azalea festival,

234
00:16:45,687 --> 00:16:48,759
and its leisurely Southern air.

235
00:16:52,567 --> 00:16:57,247
John Gray and his family lived
on the south side of town,

236
00:16:57,247 --> 00:17:02,487
near the L & N railroad tracks
at 407 Royal Street.

237
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:06,927
He would soon be asked
to fight a war for freedom,

238
00:17:06,927 --> 00:17:09,927
though his own country's
definition of freedom

239
00:17:09,927 --> 00:17:12,927
did not include him.

240
00:17:12,927 --> 00:17:15,767
GRAY: Whites and blacks got along
pretty good,

241
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:19,007
as long as you had
the status quo.

242
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:24,127
But you could not, uh,
eat at the counter at Woolworth.

243
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:26,287
You'd have to go down to the end

244
00:17:26,287 --> 00:17:29,287
and order your sandwich
and take it out.

245
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:31,243
Out to eat.

246
00:17:35,047 --> 00:17:37,087
NARRATOR: Across town,

247
00:17:37,087 --> 00:17:39,927
Katharine Phillips
and her family

248
00:17:39,927 --> 00:17:43,247
lived at 1555 Monterey Place.

249
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:46,247
PHILLIPS: Daddy said Mobile
made its living

250
00:17:46,247 --> 00:17:48,407
by taking in each other's wash.

251
00:17:48,407 --> 00:17:51,487
And it was absolutely true.

252
00:17:51,487 --> 00:17:53,407
The pace of life was slow.

253
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:55,207
On a hot summer evening -

254
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:57,607
of course there was
no airconditioning -

255
00:17:57,607 --> 00:18:01,447
so Daddy would load us in
the car and we'd drive downtown

256
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:05,447
to Brown's Ice Cream and
he'd buy us an ice-cream cone

257
00:18:05,447 --> 00:18:08,047
and then we'd drive out
to Arlington

258
00:18:08,047 --> 00:18:10,367
and park out by the bay,

259
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:13,527
and all sit there
and enjoy the sea breeze.

260
00:18:13,527 --> 00:18:16,687
And when we'd cooled down
enough, he'd bring us home

261
00:18:16,687 --> 00:18:19,967
and everybody could go to bed
and go to sleep.

262
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:22,967
Or we sat on our porch
in the evening

263
00:18:22,967 --> 00:18:25,407
and the children played
in the yard.

264
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:28,527
It was a wonderful way
to grow up.

265
00:18:28,527 --> 00:18:31,207
And we were completely away
from the rest of the world

266
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:32,720
down in Mobile.

267
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:47,847
NARRATOR:
No-one in Mobile, Waterbury,

268
00:18:47,847 --> 00:18:52,847
Sacramento, Luverne,
or anywhere else in America

269
00:18:52,847 --> 00:18:55,527
was prepared
for what was about to happen

270
00:18:55,527 --> 00:18:58,599
to them and their country.

271
00:19:13,927 --> 00:19:17,247
DANIEL INOUYE:
Pearl Harbor was a Sunday

272
00:19:17,247 --> 00:19:20,087
and, together with the family,

273
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:22,847
we were all getting ready
to go to church.

274
00:19:22,847 --> 00:19:26,847
And the disc jockey's going on
with Hawaiian music,

275
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,967
and, suddenly,
he sounded hysterical.

276
00:19:29,967 --> 00:19:33,967
For a moment,
I thought this was an act.

277
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:37,847
So I stepped out into the street
and, sure enough...

278
00:19:37,847 --> 00:19:43,127
there are puffs and smoke coming
out of that Pearl Harbor area.

279
00:19:43,127 --> 00:19:45,127
And so I called my father out,

280
00:19:45,127 --> 00:19:46,807
said, "Look at that."

281
00:19:46,807 --> 00:19:51,807
And, all of a sudden, three
aircraft flew right overhead.

282
00:19:51,807 --> 00:19:55,880
They were pearl grey
with red dots.

283
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:59,447
I knew what was happening.

hundreds of Japanese warplanes,

So terrible a toll

17-year-old Daniel Inouye,
the son of a Japanese immigrant,

307
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:13,887
was a senior at William McKinley

00:22:35,447 --> 00:22:39,207
but here she was with her arms
around her baby.

314
00:22:39,207 --> 00:22:42,167
And, uh...

315
00:22:42,167 --> 00:22:46,001
So this is
what I had to pick up, at 17.

316
00:22:56,647 --> 00:22:58,487
MAN ON RADIO:
One, two, three, four.

317
00:22:58,487 --> 00:23:01,207
Hello, NBC. Hello, NBC.

318
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:04,961
This is KBU in Honolulu, Hawaii.

319
00:23:12,087 --> 00:23:16,007
SIDNEY PHILLIPS: I was in a drugstore,
drinking a milkshake,

320
00:23:16,007 --> 00:23:19,847
and this lady burst in
the side door and screamed,

321
00:23:19,847 --> 00:23:22,287
"Turn on the radio!"

322
00:23:22,287 --> 00:23:25,447
They were talking about
Pearl Harbor on every station.

323
00:23:25,447 --> 00:23:27,287
MAN ON RADIO:
And London now awaits

324
00:23:27,287 --> 00:23:29,327
Prime Minister Churchill's promise

325
00:23:29,327 --> 00:23:32,727
to declare war on Japan
within the hour.

326
00:23:32,727 --> 00:23:35,047
We knew this meant
we were in the war.

327
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:38,407
And we just...

328
00:23:38,407 --> 00:23:41,687
all sat there quietly.

329
00:23:41,687 --> 00:23:45,475
The radio kept giving the same
information again and again.

330
00:23:47,247 --> 00:23:49,287
BARBARA COVINGTON:
I remember I was home eating breakfast

331
00:23:49,287 --> 00:23:51,087
with my mother
and my two brothers.

332
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:52,687
I was the youngest,

333
00:23:52,687 --> 00:23:55,607
and we were getting ready
to go to Sunday school.

334
00:23:55,607 --> 00:23:58,167
I remember the fear
coming in my mother's eyes,

335
00:23:58,167 --> 00:24:00,207
because she knew my brothers

336
00:24:00,207 --> 00:24:02,596
were probably going to be
called, and they were.

337
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:07,647
LEOPOLD: It seemed so incredible.

338
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:11,287
2,400 innocent people

339
00:24:11,287 --> 00:24:15,007
blown off the face of the earth
was an atrocity.

340
00:24:15,007 --> 00:24:18,847
It was something
that had to be corrected -

341
00:24:18,847 --> 00:24:22,007
perhaps the word
might be 'avenged'.

342
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:26,683
And, um...
we had to get busy with it.

343
00:24:30,927 --> 00:24:34,327
NARRATOR: On December 8,
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt

344
00:24:34,327 --> 00:24:37,239
asked Congress
to declare war on Japan.

345
00:24:38,447 --> 00:24:40,167
Three days later,

346
00:24:40,167 --> 00:24:44,807
Japan's allies, Nazi Germany
and Fascist Italy,

347
00:24:44,807 --> 00:24:48,567
declared war
on the United States.

348
00:24:48,567 --> 00:24:50,327
All across the country,

349
00:24:50,327 --> 00:24:53,247
anxious Americans
asked themselves,

350
00:24:53,247 --> 00:24:55,317
"How did this happen?"

351
00:24:56,647 --> 00:25:00,087
For more than a decade,
they had had glimpses of a world

352
00:25:00,087 --> 00:25:02,327
descending into chaos -

353
00:25:02,327 --> 00:25:05,247
in their newspapers,
over the radio

354
00:25:05,247 --> 00:25:08,167
and in newsreels
shown in movie theatres.

355
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:12,247
The Strand and the State
in Waterbury.

356
00:25:12,247 --> 00:25:16,647
The Crest and the Alhambra
in Sacramento.

357
00:25:16,647 --> 00:25:20,367
The Roxy and the Pike in Mobile.

358
00:25:20,367 --> 00:25:24,758
And the Pix and the Palace
in Luverne.

359
00:25:33,687 --> 00:25:37,287
NEWSREEL: For the first time,
we saw great cities squashed flat,

360
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:39,596
civilians bombed and killed.

361
00:25:49,727 --> 00:25:53,481
NARRATOR: They had hoped
they could stay out of it all.

362
00:25:54,727 --> 00:25:57,527
EMMA BELLE PETCHER:
You couldn't fathom across the ocean,

363
00:25:57,527 --> 00:26:00,487
you know,
and you couldn't fathom

364
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:02,287
what it was really like.

365
00:26:02,287 --> 00:26:04,767
But they would show
these newsreels,

366
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:08,007
and I'd sneak in the back of the
theatre and see these newsreels,

367
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:09,599
and they were horrifying.

368
00:26:39,167 --> 00:26:42,287
NARRATOR: Throughout the 1930s,
country after country

369
00:26:42,287 --> 00:26:45,127
had been held hostage
to the ruthless ambitions

370
00:26:45,127 --> 00:26:48,563
of the leaders of
what would be called the Axis.

371
00:26:50,367 --> 00:26:54,487
Benito Mussolini, the swaggering
dictator of Italy,

372
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:58,287
dreamed of restoring the ancient
Roman Empire and becoming

373
00:26:58,287 --> 00:27:01,359
master of the Mediterranean.

374
00:27:03,127 --> 00:27:06,807
Adolf Hitler built
his monstrous Nazi regime

375
00:27:06,807 --> 00:27:09,327
and the mightiest army on earth

376
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:12,647
on the German thirst
for revenge -

377
00:27:12,647 --> 00:27:16,327
revenge against the victors
of the First World War,

378
00:27:16,327 --> 00:27:20,487
but also against those at home
who he claimed had stabbed

379
00:27:20,487 --> 00:27:22,847
their armed forces in the back -

380
00:27:22,847 --> 00:27:26,887
socialists, communists
and the Jews.

381
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:28,367
Above all, the Jews,

382
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:31,882
who he said were both
evil and subhuman.

383
00:27:33,807 --> 00:27:37,687
The German people were superior
to all others, he assured them,

384
00:27:37,687 --> 00:27:42,047
and he had been chosen to lead
them to their great destiny -

385
00:27:42,047 --> 00:27:44,647
a Reich that would rule
over the Old World

386
00:27:44,647 --> 00:27:47,167
and the New
for a thousand years.

387
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,761
(Crowd chants) Heil! Heil!

388
00:27:56,967 --> 00:27:59,447
The fact is that I am a Jew.

389
00:27:59,447 --> 00:28:02,567
I was aware of what was
going on in Europe,

390
00:28:02,567 --> 00:28:06,527
perhaps a little more than the
average person might have known.

391
00:28:06,527 --> 00:28:10,807
And I did feel that,
somehow or other,

392
00:28:10,807 --> 00:28:14,807
that Hitler had to be stopped.

393
00:28:14,807 --> 00:28:20,279
Not only for the Jews,
but for everybody in the world.

394
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:26,447
QUENTIN AANENSON:
We knew the war in Europe

395
00:28:26,447 --> 00:28:29,527
was going to affect us
eventually.

396
00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:34,078
After Czechoslovakia had been
taken over by Germany...

397
00:28:36,287 --> 00:28:39,487
we knew that the war
was coming our direction,

398
00:28:39,487 --> 00:28:41,079
one way or the other.

399
00:28:48,847 --> 00:28:51,807
NEWSREEL: The beginning of
the Blitzkrieg, "the lightning war",

400
00:28:51,807 --> 00:28:54,799
ripping deep into a nation
not equipped to meet it.

401
00:28:57,807 --> 00:29:01,167
NARRATOR:
On September 1, 1939,

402
00:29:01,167 --> 00:29:03,487
Hitler's forces stormed across

403
00:29:03,487 --> 00:29:04,966
the border of Poland.

404
00:29:14,287 --> 00:29:17,727
In response to the attack,
Britain and France

405
00:29:17,727 --> 00:29:20,366
declared war on Germany.

406
00:29:22,327 --> 00:29:26,002
The Second World War had begun.

407
00:29:35,567 --> 00:29:38,287
Denmark and Norway fell.

408
00:29:38,287 --> 00:29:41,359
Holland had surrendered.

409
00:29:43,287 --> 00:29:46,087
Belgium was crushed.

410
00:29:46,087 --> 00:29:48,601
French defences had collapsed.

411
00:29:49,887 --> 00:29:52,765
And in June of 1940, Paris fell.

412
00:29:54,687 --> 00:30:00,398
Adolf Hitler was the master
of Western Europe.

413
00:30:03,127 --> 00:30:07,327
Then he set his sights
on Britain.

414
00:30:07,327 --> 00:30:10,967
For more than a year,
she would stand alone

415
00:30:10,967 --> 00:30:13,481
against relentless attack
from the air.

416
00:30:15,767 --> 00:30:17,327
EDWARD MURROW ON RADIO:
Hello, America.

417
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:20,127
This is Edward Murrow
speaking from London.

418
00:30:20,127 --> 00:30:21,607
They came over shortly

419
00:30:21,607 --> 00:30:23,727
after blackout time
and opened the attack

420
00:30:23,727 --> 00:30:26,446
with a veritable shower
of flares and incendiaries.

421
00:30:27,647 --> 00:30:29,647
NARRATOR: When his plans
for Britain faltered,

422
00:30:29,647 --> 00:30:32,047
Hitler had turned his attention
to the east,

423
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:35,167
ordering 3 million troops
in a surprise attack

424
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,607
on his supposed ally,
the Soviet Union,

425
00:30:38,607 --> 00:30:42,236
setting in motion the worst
slaughter of the war.

426
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:57,487
Meanwhile, on the far side
of the world,

427
00:30:57,487 --> 00:31:00,887
the military men who ruled Japan
in the name of the emperor,

428
00:31:00,887 --> 00:31:03,967
believed their people
superior, too.

429
00:31:03,967 --> 00:31:07,647
Their small, crowded
island nation had moved

430
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:10,207
from medieval feudalism
to the modern era

431
00:31:10,207 --> 00:31:13,087
in less than a century.

432
00:31:13,087 --> 00:31:16,047
And they dreamed of Japan's
becoming a mighty,

433
00:31:16,047 --> 00:31:17,639
self-sufficient power.

434
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,887
With extraordinary brutality,

435
00:31:22,887 --> 00:31:25,720
they had set out to seize
the resources of China.

436
00:31:27,367 --> 00:31:30,087
And they coveted
the French and Dutch

437
00:31:30,087 --> 00:31:33,397
and British colonies
in South-East Asia as well.

438
00:31:40,247 --> 00:31:41,927
NEWSREEL:
From Shanghai to Nanking,

439
00:31:41,927 --> 00:31:43,927
Japan still spreads destruction
from the skies

440
00:31:43,927 --> 00:31:45,847
upon a score of Chinese cities.

441
00:31:45,847 --> 00:31:48,367
Here is the result -

442
00:31:48,367 --> 00:31:51,484
innocent victims of the savagery
that masquerades as modern war.

443
00:32:05,967 --> 00:32:08,447
NARRATOR: Among the obstacles
in Japan's way

444
00:32:08,447 --> 00:32:12,687
were the US Pacific Fleet
based in Hawaii...

445
00:32:12,687 --> 00:32:17,367
and American military outposts
in Guam, Wake Island,

446
00:32:17,367 --> 00:32:20,200
and in the Commonwealth
of the Philippines.

447
00:32:26,687 --> 00:32:28,927
The Axis leaders were united

448
00:32:28,927 --> 00:32:30,883
in their scorn
for the United States.

449
00:32:32,607 --> 00:32:35,607
Its people were "timid,
undisciplined scum",

450
00:32:35,607 --> 00:32:37,927
Hitler said,
"under the influence

451
00:32:37,927 --> 00:32:39,679
"of Negroes and Jews".

452
00:32:40,767 --> 00:32:43,967
He was certain
such a mongrel people

453
00:32:43,967 --> 00:32:47,198
could never win a war against
his Aryan legions.

454
00:32:50,967 --> 00:32:54,127
President Roosevelt had done
everything he could,

455
00:32:54,127 --> 00:32:57,607
short of war, to combat
the aggressors.

456
00:32:57,607 --> 00:33:01,202
Providing desperately needed aid
to Britain and Russia...

457
00:33:02,567 --> 00:33:06,526
...demanding that Japan
withdraw from China.

458
00:33:07,647 --> 00:33:10,447
Finally,
freezing Japanese assets

459
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:13,447
in the United States,
so that no American oil

460
00:33:13,447 --> 00:33:16,484
could be used to fuel
further aggression in Asia.

461
00:33:20,807 --> 00:33:23,607
For the Japanese militarists,

462
00:33:23,607 --> 00:33:27,367
that had been the signal
to go to war with America.

463
00:33:27,367 --> 00:33:31,807
They made General Hideki Tojo
prime minister.

464
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:34,247
He thought that by destroying

465
00:33:34,247 --> 00:33:36,047
the US Pacific Fleet
at Pearl Harbor

466
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:37,967
in a single blow,

467
00:33:37,967 --> 00:33:41,167
he could stun and demoralise
the country long enough

468
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:43,967
to become so dominant
in the region

469
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:47,039

came back and strafed us,

and dropped one bomb
and hit him direct.

494

And all I ever found of him
was his left foot in a shoe.

turned his wings

00:43:55,607 --> 00:43:59,127
and joined the Marine Corps.

626
00:43:59,127 --> 00:44:04,367
And then, of course,
life really took on meaning.

627
00:44:04,367 --> 00:44:08,327
SIDNEY: My father was
very patriotic, and...

628
00:44:08,327 --> 00:44:12,407
I felt like really expected me
to join the military,

629
00:44:12,407 --> 00:44:15,927
so my friend W.O. Brown

630
00:44:15,927 --> 00:44:18,407
said, "Sid, let's go join
the navy in the morning."

631
00:44:18,407 --> 00:44:20,767
And I said, "Fine."

632
00:44:20,767 --> 00:44:22,407
And the recruiting office
was crowded

633
00:44:22,407 --> 00:44:23,887
like you wouldn't believe,

634
00:44:23,887 --> 00:44:26,924
so we walked up
to the head of the line...

635
00:44:28,527 --> 00:44:31,447
...saw this marine
recruiting sergeant.

636
00:44:31,447 --> 00:44:32,927
He came over and said,

637
00:44:32,927 --> 00:44:34,647
"Do you boys want
to kill Japs?"

638
00:44:34,647 --> 00:44:36,487
And we said,
"Yeah, that's the idea,

639
00:44:36,487 --> 00:44:38,327
"but we're going
to join the navy."

640
00:44:38,327 --> 00:44:41,447
And he said, "No," he said,
"You don't belong in the navy.

641
00:44:41,447 --> 00:44:43,007
"You belong in the Marine Corps.

642
00:44:43,007 --> 00:44:44,847
"You can't get
in the navy, anyway,

643
00:44:44,847 --> 00:44:46,407
"because your parents
are married."

644
00:44:46,407 --> 00:44:49,604
And we, uh, ended up
joining the Marine Corps.

645
00:44:50,807 --> 00:44:54,687
KATHARINE:
So, Sidney joined the marines.

646
00:44:54,687 --> 00:44:58,367
Daddy told Mother, "You might
as well sign the paper, Kate.

647
00:44:58,367 --> 00:44:59,847
"He's going to go anyway."

648
00:44:59,847 --> 00:45:02,607
He was only 17 years old.

649
00:45:02,607 --> 00:45:06,127
So, the story in the family is,

650
00:45:06,127 --> 00:45:10,007
the marine recruiting officer
crossed the street

651
00:45:10,007 --> 00:45:13,607
any time in the next year
that he encountered my mother,

652
00:45:13,607 --> 00:45:16,927
because she would give him
a piece of her mind

653
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:21,523
for taking her little boy
into the marines.

654
00:45:23,607 --> 00:45:26,607
NARRATOR: Unlike the professional
armies of Germany and Japan,

655
00:45:26,607 --> 00:45:28,127
the armed forces

656
00:45:28,127 --> 00:45:30,767
that Sid Phillips and others
rushed to join

657
00:45:30,767 --> 00:45:34,885
had been totally unprepared
to wage a world war.

658
00:45:36,927 --> 00:45:41,007
In 1940, the US Army
had been smaller

659
00:45:41,007 --> 00:45:43,167
than that of Romania -

660
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:46,007
only 174,000 men in uniform,

661
00:45:46,007 --> 00:45:50,603
wearing tin hats and leggings
issued during World War I.

662
00:45:52,527 --> 00:45:57,407
Then, in the fall of 1940,
Congress enacted the draft,

663
00:45:57,407 --> 00:46:01,447
and every young man
in America began to worry

664
00:46:01,447 --> 00:46:03,165
when his number would come up.

665
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,607
WILLIAM PERKINS:
Somebody got the greetings.

666
00:46:06,607 --> 00:46:08,967
Long envelope, you know.

667
00:46:08,967 --> 00:46:11,447
And when you opened it up,
it would say,

668
00:46:11,447 --> 00:46:13,647
"Greetings, The President
of the United States

669
00:46:13,647 --> 00:46:16,767
"and your neighbours
have selected you

670
00:46:16,767 --> 00:46:20,367
"to be drafted
into the armed forces for...

671
00:46:20,367 --> 00:46:22,887
"to protect the country,
etc, etc..."

672
00:46:22,887 --> 00:46:25,567
And I was down
at a friend of mine's,

673
00:46:25,567 --> 00:46:28,287
Howard Lopes,
and he got the letter,

674
00:46:28,287 --> 00:46:30,847
and he opened it up,
and he was drafted.

675
00:46:30,847 --> 00:46:34,767
And, so, boy, we just
laughed and roared,

676
00:46:34,767 --> 00:46:37,687
and then I had to go home.

677
00:46:37,687 --> 00:46:40,327
And when I walked in the house,
my grandma says,

678
00:46:40,327 --> 00:46:42,487
"There's a letter up for you
up there."

679
00:46:42,487 --> 00:46:45,927
And, uh, I... so, I picked
it up, and I looked at it.

680
00:46:45,927 --> 00:46:47,407
And it said, "Greetings,

681
00:46:47,407 --> 00:46:50,047
"The President of the United States
and your neighbours..."

682
00:46:50,047 --> 00:46:52,927
I flew out the house,
run down the street, you know,

683
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:54,967
back up the street
where Howard lived,

684
00:46:54,967 --> 00:46:57,567
and I walked in
with the paper in my hand.

685
00:46:57,567 --> 00:46:59,047
Everybody looked at me,

686
00:46:59,047 --> 00:47:00,567
and they had a good time
laughing,

687
00:47:00,567 --> 00:47:02,047
because I had been drafted.

688
00:47:02,047 --> 00:47:04,047
They knew.
I didn't have to tell them.

689
00:47:04,047 --> 00:47:05,958
I just hold up... the letter up.

690
00:47:07,807 --> 00:47:10,887
NARRATOR: Despite a growing chorus
of protests by black citizens

691
00:47:10,887 --> 00:47:13,607
outraged at the idea
of fighting bigotry abroad

692
00:47:13,607 --> 00:47:15,607
while it was tolerated at home,

693
00:47:15,607 --> 00:47:18,127
the military continued to insist

694
00:47:18,127 --> 00:47:22,564
on segregating African-American
servicemen into all-black units.

695
00:47:25,047 --> 00:47:27,127
Even blood supplies
for saving the lives

696
00:47:27,127 --> 00:47:29,197
of the wounded
were kept separate.

697
00:47:31,887 --> 00:47:34,207
WILLIE RUSHTON:
I always thought that, one day,

698
00:47:34,207 --> 00:47:36,402
our country would be better
for everybody.

699
00:47:37,807 --> 00:47:40,567
'Cause I knew
I saw a lot of things

700
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:42,447
that my father had to go through

701
00:47:42,447 --> 00:47:44,287
that I didn't have
to go through,

702
00:47:44,287 --> 00:47:46,647
so I figured that
when my children come on,

703
00:47:46,647 --> 00:47:48,967
we'd still have something better
than what I had,

704
00:47:48,967 --> 00:47:52,047
so that's why I wanted
to go fight for my country.

705
00:47:52,047 --> 00:47:56,484
I was fairly close
to being a pacifist.

706
00:47:57,767 --> 00:48:01,087
I believed that there is

707
00:48:01,087 --> 00:48:04,007
mostly negotiated solutions

708
00:48:04,007 --> 00:48:06,607
to most problems of this sort.

709
00:48:06,607 --> 00:48:10,407
But I couldn't fathom
that there was ever

710
00:48:10,407 --> 00:48:14,287
a solution to the confrontation
that Hitler was giving

711
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:17,967
to us and the rest of the world.

712
00:48:17,967 --> 00:48:22,487
I felt that I belonged
in the service,

713
00:48:22,487 --> 00:48:26,327
um, because the threat,

714
00:48:26,327 --> 00:48:30,007
while it was directed
at the entire rest of the world,

715
00:48:30,007 --> 00:48:32,247
was particularly directed

716
00:48:32,247 --> 00:48:36,127
at the origins that I came from.

717
00:48:36,127 --> 00:48:38,277
(DUKE ELLINGTON'S
'ECHOES OF HARLEM' PLAYS)

718
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:00,287
If I didn't know it
at the particular moment I went in,

719
00:49:00,287 --> 00:49:03,287
13 weeks later, after I had
finished my basic training,

720
00:49:03,287 --> 00:49:06,962
I knew, expertly, how to kill.

721
00:49:08,767 --> 00:49:11,247
Kill with a bayonet,
kill with a bullet,

722
00:49:11,247 --> 00:49:13,087
kill with your hands.

723
00:49:13,087 --> 00:49:15,760
Yes, I could kill.

724
00:49:18,887 --> 00:49:21,487
HYNES:
I left Minneapolis for the service

725
00:49:21,487 --> 00:49:25,487
on a dank, wet, cold

726
00:49:25,487 --> 00:49:28,365
March Minneapolis evening.

727
00:49:30,407 --> 00:49:33,087
My father drove me
to the station

728
00:49:33,087 --> 00:49:38,487
in the car that he almost
never let me drive as a kid,

729
00:49:38,487 --> 00:49:42,447
downtown, past all the...

730
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:45,087
places that had been the, uh,

731
00:49:45,087 --> 00:49:49,287
stations of my childhood
and growing up,

732
00:49:49,287 --> 00:49:51,801
to the Rock Island Railroad.

733
00:49:53,727 --> 00:49:55,207
It was dark.

734
00:49:55,207 --> 00:49:56,847
The long platform was dark

735
00:49:56,847 --> 00:50:00,487
with hanging
arc lights at distance,

736
00:50:00,487 --> 00:50:01,967
so that, as you walked,

737
00:50:01,967 --> 00:50:04,487
it was dark, light,
dark, light, dark, light.

738
00:50:04,487 --> 00:50:08,647
And at the far end
was a navy yeoman

739
00:50:08,647 --> 00:50:12,327
with a clipboard
and a gathering of young men

740
00:50:12,327 --> 00:50:14,287
or boys around him.

741
00:50:14,287 --> 00:50:19,447
And we stopped,
and my father shook my hand.

742
00:50:19,447 --> 00:50:22,967
It seemed very strange to me
that my father and I

743
00:50:22,967 --> 00:50:25,847
were on handshaking terms.

744
00:50:25,847 --> 00:50:29,687
Then he turned around and walked
back toward the entrance -

745
00:50:29,687 --> 00:50:31,887
dark, light, dark, light,
dark, light -

746
00:50:31,887 --> 00:50:34,167
and out into the street
and was gone.

747
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:36,287
And I turned to the yeoman
and went up

748
00:50:36,287 --> 00:50:39,047
and said, "Present,"
when my name came up,

749
00:50:39,047 --> 00:50:40,719
and I was in the navy.

750
00:50:46,127 --> 00:50:47,607
NARRATOR: Nearly 50 million men

751
00:50:47,607 --> 00:50:50,724
would register for the draft
during the war.

752
00:50:52,207 --> 00:50:57,281
Some 16 million Americans would
eventually wear their country's uniform.

753
00:51:00,447 --> 00:51:04,087
But during the days immediately
following Pearl Harbor,

754
00:51:04,087 --> 00:51:08,807
it was still anyone's guess
where they would be sent

755
00:51:08,807 --> 00:51:11,241
or how well they would fight
when they got there.
