1
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:49,356
- One more minute and we'll be going over.
- The men are ready, sir.

2
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,351
Private Laurel.

3
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:55,228
You stay here and guard this post
until relieved from duty.

4
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:00,233
Gee, I wish I was going with you.
Take care of yourself.

5
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,949
Don't worry about me, Stan.
I'll be back. We'll all be back.

6
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,556
So long, pal.

7
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,072
(Heavy gunfire)

8
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,756
(Gunfire stops)

9
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,358
(Jazzy bugle call)

10
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,674
(Aircraft humming)

11
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,469
You brainless idiot!
What are you trying to do?!

12
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,269
- Put that thing down!
- War is war and I've got my orders.

13
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,828
- What orders?
- To guard this post.

14
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,991
You block-head!
The war's been over for 20 years.

15
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,595
It doesn't make any difference.
When I'm told to do something...

16
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:09,589
- What d'you say?
- The war's been over for 20 years.

17
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,352
Eh?

18
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,079
The war's been over for 20 years!

19
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:22,119
Ha! How time flies.

20
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,069
Just seems like yesterday.

21
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,469
- What d'you say?
- You heard me.

22
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,597
- Well, that accounts for it.
- Accounts for what?

23
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,592
Everything's been kinda quiet lately.

24
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,478
Come with me. I'll see that you get home.

25
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,998
War's been over for...
Well, it's better than staying here.

26
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,551
Thanks very much. Are you sure
the war's been over for 20 years?

27
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,392
Positively. I can prove it to you.

28
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:54,109
If it isn't, somebody's going
to get into an awful jam.

29
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,396
Paper! Morning paper!

30
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,111
Were the eggs done enough
this morning, dear?

31
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,436
Is there anything else, dear?

32
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,358
I almost burned my finger
on the bacon this morning.

33
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,112
My love, you've got something
on your mind.

34
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,475
You can't fool your baby Oliver.

35
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:44,998
Oh, Oliver! You don't even remember
what happened a year ago today.

36
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,509
Was that the day I fell off the bicycle?

37
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:53,354
No, Oliver. Now just try to think.

38
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,069
It had something to do with you and me.

39
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,150
I give up. I can't quite remember
what you mean.

40
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,949
Unless it was the day
we got married... That's it!

41
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:14,635
It was just a year ago today
that you came into my heart.

42
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,756
How could I forget?

43
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,030
Congratulations, Mrs Hardy.

44
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,315
Of course I didn't forget.

45
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,033
We'll celebrate. We'll have a party.

46
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:32,352
Oh, Oliver!
How I've looked forward to this day.

47
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,797
I planned a dinner just for the two of us,
as I did a year ago tonight.

48
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:41,670
- You're so sweet and I'm such a cad.
- No, you're not.

49
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,036
We'll do anything your little heart desires.

50
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,554
We'll have a nice quiet dinner

51
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,438
and after that, we'll sit and hold hands

52
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,478
and I'll whisper sweet nothings
in your ear.

53
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,835
Oh, Oliver!

54
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:59,949
This is wonderful. And you are so wonderful.

55
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,872
Could I have an extra dollar
with my allowance?

56
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,315
Isn't 75 cents a day enough for you?

57
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,755
Usually it is but today is different.

58
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:15,197
I wish you wouldn't ask me what I'm
going to do with it. It's to be a surprise.

59
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,236
Oh, Oliver, of course.

60
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:21,359
You can have a dollar
and 25 cents more... today.

61
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,396
There's one more thing.

62
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,189
Do you mind if I use the car?
I'll only be gone one hour.

63
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,955
Of course not.
But be careful and hurry right back.

64
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,830
Thank you. I won't even say goodbye,
my precious little Fig Newton.

65
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,912
I'll just say, pardon me for one hour.

66
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,109
And make that hour short.

67
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,431
(Whistles merrily)

68
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,592
- Good morning, Mrs Gilbert.
- Good morning, Mr Hardy.

69
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,478
Gorgeous day, isn't it? Bright, cheerful.

70
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,552
- It's a lovely day.
- This is quite a day for me.

71
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,155
My anniversary... and Mrs Hardy's too.

72
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,312
- Oh, how nice! Congratulations.
- Thank you.

73
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:16,235
I have reason to celebrate. Mr Gilbert is due
back after two months hunting in Africa.

74
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,757
Oh, fine! Then we both have a reason
to celebrate. Congratulations.

75
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,991
- Thank you.
- Oh. It's all right. I'll get them.

76
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,512
Hello, darling. This is Mr Hardy.
My husband, Mr Gilbert.

77
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,559
How do you do?
You came back unexpectedly.

78
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:40,154
Yes. You see, we were holding hands...

79
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,869
We were shaking hands
and the newspapers fell out.

80
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,997
Well, I guess we can get up now.

81
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:51,471
I guess we'd better be going. Goodbye.
I'm glad to have seen you.

82
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,949
Excuse me. My mistake. I'm sorry.

83
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:59,034
Oh. There you are.
Goodbye. Oh... Goodbye, Mr Gilbert.

84
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:03,318
- And who is that snake?
- Mr Hardy. He's our neighbour.

85
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,278
Come in, dear.
It's so nice to have you home.

86
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,909
Good morning, James.
What's the news this morning?

87
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,197
A fella stayed in the trenches
20 years after the war.

88
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,273
- He didn't know it was over!
- How could anyone be so stupid?

89
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,715
I don't know. Here's his picture.

90
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,673
I can't imagine anybody being that dumb.

91
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:33,310
Oh, yes, I can!

92
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,235
(Deep voice) Out, please.

93
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,872
- (Deep voice) Thank you.
- Quite all right, sir.

94
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,116
Down, please.

95
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,836
(Bang)

96
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,996
(Crashing)

97
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,634
I don't see him just now but you'll
find him on the grounds somewhere.

98
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,472
Thank you.

99
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:28,595
- Ollie!
- Stan! Don't get up now. Sit right there.

100
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:32,719
- How did you know I was here?
- I saw your picture in the paper.

101
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,076
- How did I look?
- You haven't changed a bit.

102
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:41,280
Neither have you. If I hadn't have seen you,
I never would have known you.

103
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,750
- Gee, I'm glad to see you.
- I'm glad to see you too.

104
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,957
- Have you missed me?
- I certainly have.

105
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:51,476
I missed you too.
How's things and everything?

106
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:54,552
Everything's just fine. I got married.

107
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:57,313
You don't tell me? Who d'ya marry? Fifi?

108
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,436
- No.
- Er, Lulu?

109
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,397
- No.
- Camille?

110
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,471
- No.
- I know. Fanny.

111
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:06,950
No. You wouldn't know her.
She's a local girl.

112
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:11,033
Wait till you meet her. She's one
of the finest women that ever lived.

113
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,634
- Don't tell.
- And can she cook!

114
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,358
- Can she?
- Can she?

115
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,638
Wait till you put your legs
under that table... Pardon me.

116
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:22,473
Wait till you put your leg under that table

117
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,475
and put your teeth into a big, thick,
juicy steak covered with mushrooms

118
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:31,633
and those hot biscuits
oozing with molten butter.

119
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,393
And those seven-layered chocolate cakes

120
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,755
swimming in whipped cream.

121
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:40,150
- Any beans?
- You can have beans if you want.

122
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,835
- You can have anything you want.
- (Bugle call)

123
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:53,394
It was nice of you to call, Ollie.

124
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:57,393
I hope you'll come see me again sometime.
I've got to be going.

125
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,792
- Where are you going?
- It's call for mess. I've got to eat.

126
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:05,270
You're coming home with me
to meet the missus.

127
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:08,796
- Am I?
- And have a big, thick, juicy steak.

128
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,269
- Thank you, Ollie.
- You're welcome.

129
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,559
I want you to remember -
from now on, my home is your home.

130
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,074
- Thank you, Ollie.
- You're welcome.

131
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:22,436
And I'm never going to let you
out of my sight again.

132
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,193
- Thank you, Ollie.
- You're welcome.

133
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,555
Just sit back and relax.

134
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,796
I'm sure glad to see you, kid.

135
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,998
Gee, Ollie. This is just like old times.
You and I being together.

136
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:37,594
You took the words right out of my mouth.

137
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,956
- We sure used to have a lot of fun.
- We sure did.

138
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,508
- You remember how dumb I used to be?
- Yeah.

139
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:46,831
- I'm better now.
- I'm certainly glad to hear it.

140
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,388
- Will you wait a minute, Ollie?
- Why?

141
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,189
- I want a drink of water.
- You sit right there. I'll get it.

142
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:56,875
- I only want to get to the faucet.
- How can you get there?

143
00:16:56,960 --> 00:17:00,157
You just sit and relax. I'll be right back.

144
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:43,637
Hey! Come on, lug. Get outta that chair.

145
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,951
What do you mean insulting my friend?

146
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,076
That's my buddy's chair.

147
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,720
I'll give it to you when I'm ready.

148
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,872
- Is that so?
- Yes, that's so.

149
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:58,515
Well, are you ready to give it to me?

150
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,478
On second thought, yes.

151
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:05,951
Don't exert yourself, Stanley. I'll carry you.

152
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,036
Are you comfortable?

153
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,396
Thank you, Stanley.

154
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,153
We haven't got much further to go now.

155
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,119
- Well, here we are.
- Is this your car?

156
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,395
No, it belongs to the missus.

157
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:22,836
- Sure is a pretty one.
- It's practically new.

158
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:25,150
Look, you can see yourself in it.

159
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:33,669
That's... No, I got it. That way.

160
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,955
- Now I'm nearly in.
- All right.

161
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,076
There's one...

162
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,551
Come here!

163
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,194
Why didn't you tell me you had two legs?

164
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:22,316
You didn't ask me.

165
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,915
- Get in the car!
- I've always had 'em.

166
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,757
You are better now? Hm!

167
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,639
Go and get the guy to move that truck.

168
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,196
Go on.

169
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,996
(Air hisses)

170
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:22,438
- The guy isn't there.
- Well, move it yourself.

171
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,671
(Engine starts)

172
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,870
(Gears crunch)

173
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,230
(Pneumatic hiss)

174
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,952
Hold it. Steady. Thank you.

175
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:45,068
You can say that that was
the largest boar ever bagged in India.

176
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:47,390
Kept me two months extra months away.

177
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,790
- I'll bet there's a story behind it.
- You said it.

178
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,758
He gave me more trouble
than a bunch of elephants.

179
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:58,755
It's safer to hunt on horseback
but I was on foot when he charged me.

180
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:01,638
When he got close enough, I fired.

181
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,792
The gun jammed. It was a narrow escape.

182
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,711
But what did you do?

183
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:11,271
To look at me, you wouldn't believe
that I am very light on my feet.

184
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:13,828
- I jumped to one side.
- You were in a spot.

185
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:18,357
But not for long.
If you keep cool, everything is all right

186
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:21,477
and I was cool - I had a chill in my back.

187
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:26,270
I took out both of my revolvers
and I let him have 12 shots. Six and six.

188
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,590
He almost made you a widow, Mrs Gilbert.

189
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:32,639
I never worry about my husband.
When he takes aim, it's a bullseye.

190
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:36,190
Unlike other hunters,
I don't bring 'em back alive.

191
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:39,670
I bring 'em back dead. I come back alive.

192
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,513
Did you get those elephant tusks in India?

193
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:45,956
No. In Africa. I was with my safari...

194
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:48,998
"Safari" means a bunch of native boys.

195
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,039
I had my lion gun with me -
that's smaller than an elephant gun.

196
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,955
When jumbo came charging after me,
I let him have the full magazine.

197
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:02,750
You think that bothered him?
That made him angry. It made him mad!

198
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,868
He pulled over five or six trees.
He charged again. I took aim.

199
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:09,871
And I let him have it.

200
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:14,909
- I'll be that did the trick.
- Well, there's his teeth.

201
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:20,358
I've got to go down to the gun shop. I'm
having a new gun made especially for me.

202
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,750
I mean, for elephants. Goodbye, dear.

203
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,400
- Goodbye, darling.
- Excuse me.

204
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:29,199
Thanks. This'll make an interesting story.

205
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,749
- Who opened the door?
- No one.

206
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:49,798
- It opens automatically.
- How do you mean?

207
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:52,599
Well, you see that plate?

208
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,638
You just drive over that, the door opens.

209
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,912
I never saw anything like that.
Mind if I try it?

210
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,390
No. Go ahead. Just drive straight back.

211
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,948
Now just drive it forward.

212
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,116
Ohhh!

213
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:36,630
(Ollie groaning)

214
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:39,515
- What's it say?
- "Out of order."

215
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,195
- Where'd you get that?
- I found it on there.

216
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:52,078
The fella put it on there when you were...

217
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,355
We'll have to walk up.

218
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:58,036
(Crashing)

219
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,280
- What floor do you live on?
- The 13th.

220
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,989
- Gee, that's quite a way.
- We'll be up there in a jiffy.

221
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,196
What's 13 flights?

222
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,756
Going up?

223
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,672
- Five.
- That's right. Won't be long now.

224
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,078
- Six.
- Mm.

225
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:54,312
- How long did you say it would take?
- Just a jiffy.

226
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:59,513
- How far's a jiffy?
- About three shakes of a dead lamb's tail.

227
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:03,513
Didn't think it was so far.
Surprising the distance...

228
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,749
- Seven.
- Uh-huh.

229
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:34,388
- How many with seven makes 13?
- Six.

230
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:37,916
Swell. We've only got six more jiffies.

231
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:40,036
Won't be long now.

232
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,276
(Buzzer)

233
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,715
- Eight.
- Nine.

234
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,920
I think we'd better rest a while.

235
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,876
That was a good idea of yours.

236
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:50,117
Come, come. Don't block the stairway.

237
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:52,350
Who do you think you're talking to?!

238
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:55,034
You, you big overstuffed polliwog!

239
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,032
- You smile when you call me that!
- Ha!

240
00:29:58,120 --> 00:30:01,999
If we weren't in this apartment house,
I'd wipe the floor with you!

241
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,038
- Don't let that stop you.
- Take him outside.

242
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,157
- Outside?
- See? He's afraid to go.

243
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,471
Who's afraid to go? Any time you're ready!

244
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,120
Well, there's no time like the present!

245
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:16,156
- I should say not.
- Come on!

246
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,789
You can't get away with that with me.
Polliwog, huh?

247
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:24,317
He can't talk to you like that.
There's going to be a fight.

248
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,750
There's gonna be a fight.

249
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:31,559
Hey, Ollie? What's a polliwog?

250
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:35,269
- I'll tell you later.
- There's gonna be a fight.

251
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:40,590
There's gonna be a fight.

252
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,956
There's gonna be a fight.

253
00:30:46,040 --> 00:30:48,076
You think you can get away with that?

254
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:51,914
There's gonna be a fight.
I'd better help you.

255
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:55,834
Never mind. Just leave it to me.
It'll be over in a jiffy.

256
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:00,676
Hey. There's gonna be a fight.

257
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:08,512
We'll show him!

258
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:12,878
- If you apologise, it's all right with me.
- Apologise?! Ha! For what?

259
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,918
For calling me an overstuffed polliwog!

260
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:19,629
No man can call me an overstuffed
polliwog and get away with it!

261
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:22,598
All right.
You're not an overstuffed polliwog.

262
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,478
- That's better.
- You're an inflated blimp!

263
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,551
That's different.

264
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,309
I don't know what that means,
but these people can't be wrong.

265
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,393
- Then fight and shut up.
- You bet your life I'll fight.

266
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:41,235
The very idea!
He wants to fight! Come outside.

267
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:48,636
I'm gonna give you one more chance
to apologise.

268
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,269
Oh, all right. I'm sorry. I apologise.

269
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,750
I knew he was yellow!

270
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:06,077
Yellow, eh?!

271
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,556
Get back there and fight!

272
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:21,555
- You'd better call an ambulance.
- Yes, sir.

273
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,677
There's gonna be a fight. You'd better come.

274
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,757
- What happened?
- The fight is over.

275
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:41,036
(Horn toots)

276
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:55,192
- What did you do to him?
- Never mind.

277
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,555
Why did you suggest coming down here

278
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:00,871
when we could have done the same thing
on the tenth floor?

279
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:04,555
- I didn't know he was gonna...
- (Woman) Ollie!

280
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,393
Lulu! Gee, I haven't seen you in ages.

281
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,438
- You remember Stan?
- How could I forget him?

282
00:33:10,520 --> 00:33:13,432
I met him today.
I haven't seen him in 20 years.

283
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,557
Everybody thought I was dead, didn't they?

284
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:20,792
- How did you find out you weren't?
- Well, I figured that...

285
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:25,156
- I saw my picture in the paper.
- Yeah.

286
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:28,516
- What ya doing?
- Taking Stan to meet the missus.

287
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,591
The missus? Are you married?

288
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:34,036
I sure am. To the finest woman in the world.

289
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,872
And how she can cook.

290
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,918
- Ollie, did you get my note?
- What note?

291
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,516
I just sent a note up and I wouldn't
want anybody but you to read it.

292
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:46,751
- What was in it?
- I was just... reminiscing.

293
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:48,990
Ohhh! We gotta get that note!

294
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,232
- Ollie. When you get it, burn it.
- I will, don't worry!

295
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,996
8:30...

296
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,758
- Hey, what ya do that for?
- Don't bother me!

297
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:20,755
Pop! Come out here!
That fat guy kicked my ball down the stairs.

298
00:34:20,840 --> 00:34:24,753
- Hey, you. Come here.
- Is there gonna be a fight?

299
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,671
Shh!

300
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,116
- Go downstairs and get that ball.
- I'm busy...

301
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,839
- Get going!
- Yes, sir.

302
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:42,119
- Go and get the ball for me.
- Why should I go down and get it?

303
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:45,795
I've got to get the note.
It's a matter of life and death.

304
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:50,396
- (Whimpering) I don't want to!
- Don't argue with me. And hurry up!

305
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:52,710
- Where's that ball?
- My friend's...

306
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,678
- I told you to get it!
- I know but...

307
00:34:55,760 --> 00:35:00,436
Go on down and get that ball!
I'll wait till you bring it back.

308
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:10,598
If he thinks I'm gonna
run downstairs, he's crazy.

309
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:20,110
Give it to the kid
and don't let it happen again.

310
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:26,237
Hey, Pop! That guy kicked me!

311
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:31,954
Why don't you put some ice in it?

312
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:48,390
Come on.

313
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:31,189
- Why didn't you tell me you had the key?
- You didn't ask me.

314
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:32,918
"Didn't ask me"!

315
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,072
- Gee, that's pretty underwear.
- Don't get personal.

316
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:39,555
- Mr Hardy?
- Ohh!

317
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,235
Yes, Mrs Gilbert?

318
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:46,471
- This note was left here by mistake.
- Thank you.

319
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,597
- Who's it from?
- It's from Lulu... No, it isn't.

320
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:54,356
- How do I know who it's from?
- This is my friend Mr Laurel, Mrs Gilbert.

321
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:57,716
- How do you do?
- Mrs Gilbert is my neighbour.

322
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:01,236
- He's going to stay with us.
- Oh, how nice.

323
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,632
- How's Mrs Hardy?
- She's still just as sweet as ever.

324
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:08,393
I was telling him how well she cooks.

325
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:12,871
Yes. I hear she's one of the best.
I hope you have a pleasant stay.

326
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,996
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

327
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,474
(Knocking)

328
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,756
Come in here.

329
00:38:29,080 --> 00:38:32,311
Yoo-hoo! Oh, honey?

330
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,476
Oh, darling!

331
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,796
Oh, baby?

332
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,315
She's gone shopping.

333
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,755
Sit down and make yourself at home.

334
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,676
You've got a swell place here.

335
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:03,910
Well, it's comfy.

336
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:07,231
- Have you got a cigarette?
- I never smoke.

337
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,153
Would your wife mind if I smoke my pipe?

338
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:14,119
Of course not.
What's all right with me is OK with her.

339
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:16,509
But a lot of dames are particular.

340
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:20,957
But she's not... What do you mean,
calling my wife a dame?

341
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,875
(Crashing)

342
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,310
Hello, honey.

343
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,434
So you were going to be back in an hour?

344
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:41,556
- Is that the wife?
- Yeah.

345
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,555
- You said she was the...
- She's only clowning. Come and meet her.

346
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,632
She's the greatest kidder
in the world. Darling?

347
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,393
Sugar, I want you to meet my buddy.

348
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:56,917
How often have I told you
not to bring your tramp friends here?

349
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:00,197
But I haven't seen Stan in 20 years.

350
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,635
I couldn't see him in a hundred years.

351
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:07,475
This is no time for levity. I've been
telling him how wonderful you could cook.

352
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:12,953
- Oh, you have?
- How about a thick, juicy steak?

353
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,828
- Who put that bee in your bonnet?
- He did, didn't you?

354
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:19,992
If you think
I'm going to stand over a hot stove

355
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,436
and cook for every knick-knack,
you're crazy.

356
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:26,159
(Gurgling)

357
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:29,876
Excuse me.

358
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,679
But, toots, Stanley's different.

359
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,830
I'll say he's different.

360
00:41:37,360 --> 00:41:39,874
And don't call me toots!

361
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:48,360
- What's a knick-knack?
- A thing that sits on top of a whatnot.

362
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,431
And don't bother me!

363
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:55,676
(Gurgling)

364
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,352
(lndistinct arguing)

365
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,398
Will you shut up?!

366
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,040
If you knew this boy, you'd appreciate him.

367
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:22,272
I went to the Soldier's Home to get
him to have a nice big, juicy steak.

368
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,316
(Knocking)

369
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,830
Come outta there!

370
00:42:29,360 --> 00:42:31,430
And put that pipe out.

371
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:54,112
(All talking at once)

372
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,032
Will you get out of my way? I'd like
somebody to cook for me for a change.

373
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:08,432
I'm not gonna stay here the rest
of my life slaving over a hot stove

374
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,832
for you and your good-for-nothing
buddies. Goodbye!

375
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,592
Goodbye.

376
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,558
- Let that be a lesson to you.
- What?

377
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,790
Never get married.

378
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:26,193
Well, thanks for the lovely time.
I'll be seeing you later.

379
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:28,874
- Where are you going?
- The Soldier's Home.

380
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:30,996
- What for?
- To eat.

381
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:35,119
You'll have something to eat
if I have to cook it myself.

382
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:38,351
You go and light the oven
and I'll set the table.

383
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,671
- We'll show her.
- I'll say we'll show her.

384
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:45,753
Ha! Ha! You can't do that to me!

385
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:47,796
Ha!

386
00:43:49,960 --> 00:43:51,996
(Gas hissing)

387
00:44:20,160 --> 00:44:21,513
Ollie?

388
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,352
- What?
- You got a match?

389
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:25,590
- What for?
- I want to light the oven.

390
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,798
Go and sit down.
You get on my nerves. I'll light it.

391
00:44:33,200 --> 00:44:37,830
Any time I want something done right,
I always have to do it myself.

392
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:43,273
- (Explosion)
- Ohhh!

393
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:33,669
Mr Hardy, what in the world happened?

394
00:45:33,760 --> 00:45:35,990
We had a slight accident.

395
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:39,789
I was planning to cook dinner
for Mr Laurel and...

396
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:43,190
- Where's Mrs Hardy?
- Luckily, she went out.

397
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,350
What would she think if she saw this?

398
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,194
- I shudder to think.
- Let me help you clean it up.

399
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,236
That's awfully sweet of you.

400
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,470
(Wheezing)

401
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,719
- Where have you been?
- I thought there was an earthquake.

402
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:05,395
Turn the gas off and get me some punch.
I'm a nervous wreck.

403
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:09,996
And get one for Mrs Gilbert.
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

404
00:46:10,080 --> 00:46:15,200
That's right. Whenever you want anything
done right, always do it yourself.

405
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,236
- Pardon us.
- Certainly.

406
00:46:17,320 --> 00:46:20,198
We'll have this place cleaned up in a jiffy.

407
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:24,357
- (Hissing)
- Turn that gas off.

408
00:46:45,040 --> 00:46:47,270
Get me some glasses.

409
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,596
Ohh!

410
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,432
(Crashing)

411
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:06,594
Gee, I'm awfully sorry, Mrs Gilbert.

412
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:09,831
That's quite all right.
Accidents will happen.

413
00:47:09,920 --> 00:47:13,037
- I'll get you something.
- No, don't bother.

414
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:16,192
I'll go to the apartment.
It won't take a minute to change.

415
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:20,068
- I'll be right back.
- That's awfully kind of you.

416
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,516
What happened?

417
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:27,476
(Crashing)

418
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:35,269
"What happened"! Oh!

419
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:45,757
Something wrong?

420
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:49,594
I left my key in the apartment. What'll I do?

421
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:53,639
Maybe Mrs Hardy left something
you can slip on.

422
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:10,117
Here, Mrs Gilbert. This is all I could find.

423
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,998
Take off that wet dress
before you catch cold.

424
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:16,629
I'll phone downstairs
and have them send you up a key.

425
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:19,871
- Thank you, Mr Hardy.
- You're welcome. Thank you.

426
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:24,516
Hello?

427
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:28,115
Hello? Hello?

428
00:48:29,560 --> 00:48:31,391
- Hello?
- Hello.

429
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,278
- This is Mr Hardy. How are you?
- Fine.

430
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,316
- Good.
- Nice weather we're having.

431
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:40,598
It's a beautiful day.
Mrs Gilbert is locked out of her apartment.

432
00:48:40,680 --> 00:48:43,513
- Will you send up a key?
- What's the number?

433
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,477
Just a minute.

434
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:48,312
1314.

435
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,791
Why should I send up a key?
If she came in here and...

436
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,638
Mrs Gilbert, the phone is out of order.
I'll have to go downstairs.

437
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:17,474
- Would you do that?
- Yes. I'll be back in just a jiffy.

438
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,516
Don't take too long.

439
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:27,230
- Mrs Hardy is coming.
- That's all right. I can explain.

440
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:30,756
Not in my pyjamas you can't.
You don't know my wife.

441
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,912
- What are we going to do?
- We've got to hide.

442
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:37,310
- I'll find a place over here.
- You come with me.

443
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:51,800
- There's no place in here to hide.
- We must find a place. My wife'll kill me!

444
00:49:56,480 --> 00:49:58,550
- Sit like a chair.
- What?

445
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:02,269
Sit like a chair, like that.
And don't make a noise.

446
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,193
Hold still.

447
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,320
Come on, quick. We can hide in here.

448
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,349
- What happened here?
- I don't know. We started to cook...

449
00:50:29,440 --> 00:50:32,671
- Where's that big, fat billycan of mine?
- He's hiding.

450
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,193
- Where?
- In there.

451
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,590
Oh, he is, is he?
Well, he won't be hiding long.

452
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:42,390
"...see my grandfather.
The grandfather laughed. He said..."

453
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,835
- Hello, sugar.
- Don't sugar me!

454
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:48,520
How come my car's all smashed?

455
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:51,433
- Well, dear...
- Sit down!

456
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,513
I come back after five minutes
and find the place wrecked!

457
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,955
- If you let me...
- Sit down!

458
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,679
Have you been playing soldier?

459
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,479
(All talking at once)

460
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,838
I try to keep things nice for you
and I come back and find things wrecked!

461
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,956
Sit down, I tell you!

462
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:14,238
If you think I'm going home
to Mother, you're crazy.

463
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:17,437
Silly to go on arguing like...

464
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:21,911
I wouldn't argue.
After all, it's no good to argue.

465
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:25,595
Just because I came up here.
I had nothing to do with it.

466
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,830
Silly to go on arguing like that.

467
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:30,275
What are you arguing about?

468
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:33,113
If you want me to go,
I'll stay as long as you want.

469
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,236
Silliest thing I ever heard.

470
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:37,390
(Argument continues)

471
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,430
And I gave you a dollar and 25 cents!

472
00:51:42,520 --> 00:51:44,829
Silliest thing I ever heard.

473
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,673
I wish you'd stop this argument.
It's the silliest thing I ever...

474
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:04,633
I never heard anything like it in my life.

475
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,194
- Isn't that terrible?
- Get up from there.

476
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,919
Oh, my beautiful stove!

477
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,231
What did you do with the kitchen?
It's wrecked!

478
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,073
(All shouting)

479
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:22,270
(Wheezing)

480
00:52:22,360 --> 00:52:25,193
- And another thing!
- Sit down!

481
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:27,953
- Get up!
- Sit down!

482
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:30,110
- Get up!
- Sit down!

483
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,760
- Get up!
- Sit down! I'm the boss here!

484
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:34,876
- Sit down!
- Get up!

485
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,192
- Oh! I'm fed up!
- Sit down! Get up!

486
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,398
(lndistinct ranting)

487
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:46,909
Get up out of there! Stand up!

488
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:48,956
- She said I could.
- I don't care!

489
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,395
If I want to sit down, I'll sit down.

490
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,234
I can do just as I like
cos she told me that I could sit...

491
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,554
Big dumbbell!

492
00:53:03,640 --> 00:53:07,792
In the trunk. Quick. Get in here quick!

493
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:16,555
- Let me tell you something.
- Let me tell you something...

494
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:21,316
- Sit down! You listen to me...
- Shush!

495
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:24,437
- I've had enough of this.
- How dare you?

496
00:53:24,520 --> 00:53:28,433
Tut tut tut tut!
I'm going to leave for a change!

497
00:53:28,520 --> 00:53:32,991
And I am not going home to Mother.
Pardon us.

498
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:34,957
Come, Stanley.

499
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,156
Ha ha ha ha ha!

500
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:38,798
Ha!

501
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:47,796
Just a minute!
Where do you think you're going?

502
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:50,838
I've packed and I'm leaving for Honolulu!

503
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:53,480
You are? Who put that bee in your bonnet?

504
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:57,678
Stan said I should get out of here.
Besides, the trip will do me good.

505
00:53:57,760 --> 00:53:59,273
Oh, you did?

506
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:03,558
So not content with wrecking my home,
you wanna take my husband away?

507
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:05,710
I'll fix you!

508
00:54:05,800 --> 00:54:08,314
- Is there gonna be a fight?
- Shh!

509
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:11,233
- Wait a minute!
- Let me tell you something...

510
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:13,470
(Argument continues)

511
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,036
What's the matter?

512
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:27,429
(Mrs Hardy) I'll tell you what's the matter.

513
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,672
That little worm is trying to break up
my happy home!

514
00:54:31,760 --> 00:54:38,359
But I'll have the police take him back to
the Old Soldier's Home where he belongs!

515
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:41,079
So you're a home breaker, huh?

516
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:45,199
You look like the kind of a guy
that would break up a happy home.

517
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:50,354
You know what I would do to anybody
that comes between me and my wife?

518
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:55,355
I'd get my trusty fowling piece
and I'd blow him...

519
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:57,158
to nothing!

520
00:54:57,240 --> 00:55:01,199
I had nothing to do with it.
He brought me here.

521
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,955
- He was gonna give me a nice steak...
- What happened?

522
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,919
He's got a girl in the trunk
and he didn't want his wife to know.

523
00:55:09,000 --> 00:55:11,992
- What did you tell him that for?
- He asked me.

524
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:15,595
When the wife's away, the rats will play!

525
00:55:18,440 --> 00:55:22,228
Why bring them into your own home?
That's ridiculous.

526
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:27,553
Come with me sometime.
I know where there's a whole bunch.

527
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,671
Listen. Why do you think
I go to Borneo all the time?

528
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,228
You can come with me sometime.

529
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:39,517
You too. How do you do? I was gonna...

530
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,431
My wife!

531
00:55:45,840 --> 00:55:48,400
I kill him!

532
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,109
I can't miss all the time!
