1
00:02:06,415 --> 00:02:10,090
At the Berlin Conference in 1885
Africa was divided.

2
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:13,213
Congo, became the personal property
of Belgian King Leopold I.

3
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:17,007
On June 30, 1960, the nationalist
Patrice Lumumba, 36, became

4
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:20,134
The first Prime Minister
of the new independent state.

5
00:02:20,296 --> 00:02:21,649
He would last only months.

6
00:02:22,256 --> 00:02:25,612
This is a true story.

7
00:03:08,858 --> 00:03:11,656
Nobody knew about that night
in Katanga.

8
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:16,690
Nobody was allowed to know.
Their mission was clear.

9
00:03:18,139 --> 00:03:21,768
Retrieve three bodies
and then disappear.

10
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:27,736
No grave, no memory...

11
00:03:31,339 --> 00:03:34,411
Even in death they were afraid of me.

12
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:30,780
Will you help me?

13
00:04:58,143 --> 00:05:01,500
The children may not
know everything that happened, do you?

14
00:05:03,784 --> 00:05:04,978
They probably wouldn't understand.

15
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:12,616
Tell them not ...

16
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:15,656
Say nothing.

17
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,665
You acted in the name of Congo,
but not your party

18
00:06:25,948 --> 00:06:27,904
Is not representative.
- It's now Lumumba's turn.

19
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:30,386
Let him continue talking.

20
00:06:30,948 --> 00:06:32,017
Right,

21
00:06:32,188 --> 00:06:36,101
The MNC does not represent
 every Congolese. Not yet.

22
00:06:36,268 --> 00:06:38,782
But Tshombe of CONAKAT 
Katanga does not represent all of Congo.

23
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:42,186
Our party is big,
yours is nothing.

24
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:43,498
There are 250 parties

25
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:46,667
in Congo.
Plus those founded by the Belgians.

26
00:06:46,949 --> 00:06:50,339
Mr. Kasavubu could take power
 but he does not have support in Accra.

27
00:06:50,989 --> 00:06:53,298
But what am I to do give out visas?

28
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:56,064
Why did the government go it alone?

29
00:06:56,229 --> 00:06:57,423
Ask them.

30
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,303
So you could sell your Polar
beer to the Minister.

31
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:03,144
He could have 51% of the vote.

32
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:04,580
I did not know.

33
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:07,259
You know many things,

34
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:09,421
starting with the protocol.

35
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,266
Is this a joke?

36
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,669
Not at all.

37
00:07:17,630 --> 00:07:22,306
Please read the full text of my speech,
not in newspapers.

38
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,905
I should talk about you
and your rich province.

39
00:07:27,311 --> 00:07:30,348
But I do not see the Congo
as tribes and provinces,

40
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:33,868
but as a whole.
We need to move beyond provincialism.

41
00:07:34,031 --> 00:07:35,908
Do we have to hear your speech once again?

42
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:38,466
Do you think you're still in Accra?

43
00:07:39,311 --> 00:07:43,271
You are two people, I
represent many more.

44
00:07:43,552 --> 00:07:48,023
We have 10,000 people. I could get CONAKAT
not to mention Tshombe if you like.

45
00:07:48,752 --> 00:07:50,265
At the next Pan-African
Conference

46
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:53,788
I will be happy to
talk about your big party.

47
00:07:54,072 --> 00:07:56,870
He derides.
- Your irony is inappropriate

48
00:07:57,512 --> 00:07:59,025
and insulting.

49
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,303
I can only say:

50
00:08:01,592 --> 00:08:02,786
Read my speech.

51
00:08:03,593 --> 00:08:06,391
Or not. But there will be no rewrite.

52
00:08:07,473 --> 00:08:10,067
You travel a far to sell your beer.

53
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:15,150
Stay away from my region.
Because we do not forget.

54
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:29,103
Yes, I made some mistakes.

55
00:08:29,394 --> 00:08:31,749
And it would all end badly.

56
00:08:31,954 --> 00:08:34,468
We thought it our destiny 
to decide our country's fate

57
00:08:34,754 --> 00:08:38,633
but other, more powerful enemies
were in control.

58
00:08:45,115 --> 00:08:46,912
Why did they fear me so much?

59
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:50,954
When they eventually killed me,
they made me more important.

60
00:08:51,275 --> 00:08:55,871
I was but one vote for the dream
of freedom and fraternity.

61
00:08:56,155 --> 00:08:59,784
Words they could not accept.
But they were just words.

62
00:09:27,277 --> 00:09:29,745
Everything was nevertheless a good start.

63
00:09:31,117 --> 00:09:32,516
Do you remember?

64
00:09:33,117 --> 00:09:35,472
I came from Stanleyville

65
00:09:35,637 --> 00:09:38,595
A colonial
administrative clerk, third class.

66
00:09:40,277 --> 00:09:42,711
I was 30 and at the height
of my career.

67
00:09:48,278 --> 00:09:51,350
But my job was not
What I had imagined,

68
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:54,351
But I suppose I shouldn't look
a gift horse in the mouth.

69
00:09:55,038 --> 00:09:55,788
Patrice Lumumba.

70
00:09:56,478 --> 00:10:00,312
You can speak to the people.
Such a person we need.

71
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:02,316
The people here are hard.

72
00:10:02,478 --> 00:10:04,992
After the triumph of Kasavubu

73
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,398
some businesses flourished,
But not ours ...

74
00:10:08,679 --> 00:10:11,147
We are on our last legs.

75
00:10:12,559 --> 00:10:15,073
If you can do things to help business resume ...

76
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:19,278
It is even said
that our beer causes impotence.

77
00:10:19,439 --> 00:10:21,316
That is how far they will go.

78
00:10:21,919 --> 00:10:24,513
If you can save the business

79
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:27,478
You will get a salary of Deputy Director.

80
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,869
Good salary, right?

81
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,719
It's very good, Director.

82
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,600
Within a month we will
need to see improvements.

83
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,392
Can I do what I want?
- If you want ...

84
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,472
Come closer, my friends.

85
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,199
Test, it's free.

86
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,113
Girls?
- Beer, slyboots.

87
00:10:46,281 --> 00:10:48,636
And not just beer. The best!

88
00:10:48,801 --> 00:10:51,110
The King of beers. Polar!

89
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:54,512
I sold beer. Why not?

90
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:57,639
Polar or Primus, they all left me cold.

91
00:10:58,561 --> 00:11:01,553
I was in the capital,
that is what was important.

92
00:11:01,841 --> 00:11:04,594
I love Primus.
Long live King Kasa.

93
00:11:05,201 --> 00:11:06,999
Here is the competition.

94
00:11:07,162 --> 00:11:08,595
Long live Congo!

95
00:11:08,882 --> 00:11:10,281
Long Live Free Congo!

96
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:12,514
Long live independence!

97
00:11:13,202 --> 00:11:15,079
That's strong language. Come here.

98
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:17,039
Take a Polar. At my expense.

99
00:11:18,122 --> 00:11:21,000
When I met Joseph,

100
00:11:21,162 --> 00:11:23,596
he was an army sergeant
but also an aspiring journalist.

101
00:11:23,882 --> 00:11:25,440
And you?
- Joseph-Desire Mobutu.

102
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:26,959
To our health.

103
00:11:27,243 --> 00:11:28,437
To our future!

104
00:11:29,003 --> 00:11:33,360
He was not Mobutu Sese Seko
Kuku Ngwendu Wasahanga,

105
00:11:33,523 --> 00:11:34,638
Father of the Nation.

106
00:11:35,843 --> 00:11:37,640
Not yet.

107
00:11:39,643 --> 00:11:43,158
Congo was still
a Belgian colony.

108
00:11:43,523 --> 00:11:45,002
Lumumba?
- Here I am. 

109
00:11:45,323 --> 00:11:46,881
Along there.

110
00:12:00,244 --> 00:12:01,074
Name?

111
00:12:02,524 --> 00:12:04,196
Lumumba. Patrice, Emery.

112
00:12:04,604 --> 00:12:06,595
You 're judicial file.

113
00:12:09,165 --> 00:12:11,076
And you hope to travel?

114
00:12:22,485 --> 00:12:23,759
Is that my visa?

115
00:12:24,765 --> 00:12:28,441
Yes, you're lucky. Or have good connections.

116
00:12:33,286 --> 00:12:36,164
Fork on the left!

117
00:12:36,646 --> 00:12:40,434
Indigenous children
learn to work and study,

118
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,035
but are only interested
in relaxation.

119
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:45,595
I do not speak Flemish!

120
00:12:46,286 --> 00:12:47,435
Can you open this?

121
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:49,844
If the teacher loses the pedals,

122
00:12:50,007 --> 00:12:52,521
take over the primitive methods ...

123
00:12:52,687 --> 00:12:54,040
Like only a small handful of others

124
00:12:54,647 --> 00:12:57,081
I got my card identifying me
as a "civilized person".

125
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:03,405
She showed me just how to buy alcohol
in the European quarter.

126
00:13:04,007 --> 00:13:05,679
Throughout the DRC?
- It wsa very Congo.

127
00:13:05,967 --> 00:13:09,643
For political Lessons
we used the gym,

128
00:13:09,808 --> 00:13:13,323
the association of employees,
the association's indigenous staff

129
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:16,002
and the Congregation
of the Virgin.

130
00:13:16,368 --> 00:13:19,599
No collaboration,
but civil disobedience.

131
00:13:19,768 --> 00:13:21,918
80 years is enough!

132
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:24,727
First the slave trade, the ivory trade

133
00:13:24,888 --> 00:13:27,163
and then killing for rubber.

134
00:13:27,328 --> 00:13:31,004
Now we sell diamonds, copper, manganese and zinc.

135
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:33,888
Everyone knows
that independence is imminent.

136
00:13:35,729 --> 00:13:38,289
Uhuru! Viva! Viva!

137
00:13:48,769 --> 00:13:50,123
Independence!

138
00:13:58,570 --> 00:13:59,844
Do you remember it now?

139
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,129
The year 1959?

140
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:05,929
With its enthusiasm,
the anger and its violence?

141
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,042
What nobody predicted was
that everything would change.

142
00:14:11,691 --> 00:14:14,763
MNC in the middle.
We will see that later.

143
00:14:15,091 --> 00:14:17,651
It's King Baudouin. Come and listen.

144
00:14:17,811 --> 00:14:19,881
They will admit.

145
00:14:20,051 --> 00:14:22,246
... that everything leads to this one decisive step

146
00:14:22,411 --> 00:14:25,608
In the life of
Our African peoples.

147
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:30,685
I owe it to
my illustrious predecessors,

148
00:14:30,852 --> 00:14:33,605
the pioneers of our work in Africa ...

149
00:14:33,772 --> 00:14:36,764
Do they keep anything on hand.

150
00:14:36,932 --> 00:14:40,129
No, they've lost the north.

151
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:42,045
Then they have lost.

152
00:14:42,652 --> 00:14:46,361
De Gaulle has admitted
that little Belgium has no choice.

153
00:14:46,772 --> 00:14:48,364
We're going to eat them!

154
00:14:49,092 --> 00:14:54,121
You know, Maurice, they will think
you were are cannibal.

155
00:14:54,293 --> 00:14:56,249
A what?

156
00:14:56,413 --> 00:14:58,290
Someone who eats human flesh.

157
00:14:58,453 --> 00:15:02,332
If that is so,
I will begin immediately.

158
00:15:02,493 --> 00:15:05,451
We decided for Congo

159
00:15:05,613 --> 00:15:09,401
without delay,
and without haste ...

160
00:15:09,693 --> 00:15:10,762
Run!

161
00:15:32,175 --> 00:15:34,484
... that without which
a democratic regime

162
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,692
there is nothing more than deceit and tyranny.

163
00:15:43,335 --> 00:15:44,450
Let him go!

164
00:15:46,055 --> 00:15:47,727
To do this you will pay!

165
00:16:05,376 --> 00:16:08,095
6 months later

166
00:16:57,379 --> 00:16:58,368
Look.

167
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,731
The director was right.
He is smuggling out messages.

168
00:17:05,659 --> 00:17:06,774
Bastard!

169
00:17:07,099 --> 00:17:10,648
"I strongly protest ...
I demand my release

170
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:15,051
as leader of MNC I am a delegate
and participate in

171
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:17,371
the Round Table
In Brussels. "

172
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,610
The pretentious monkey!

173
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:24,293
Do you think we are so stupid
as to release you

174
00:17:24,580 --> 00:17:29,574
while show subversive behavior
the very reason you're here?

175
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:36,335
You sit for two years and we
take care of you, boy.

176
00:17:36,501 --> 00:17:38,810
Do you see yourself in Brussels?

177
00:17:39,861 --> 00:17:41,340
What would you say to the King?

178
00:17:43,741 --> 00:17:46,175
What would you say to Bwana Kitoko?

179
00:17:52,861 --> 00:17:54,500
He wants to be minister.

180
00:17:55,582 --> 00:17:57,732
They all want to be minister.

181
00:17:58,582 --> 00:18:00,334
Want to be decorated?

182
00:18:01,902 --> 00:18:04,018
We'll decorate you.

183
00:18:04,782 --> 00:18:08,297
Want to be called Excellency?
Is that it monkey?

184
00:18:08,622 --> 00:18:10,692
Should we say Sir?

185
00:18:26,663 --> 00:18:29,052
We found this.

186
00:18:30,503 --> 00:18:34,542
Why is he bleeding?
- As usual. He protested.

187
00:18:36,144 --> 00:18:39,375
We intervened
and he defended himself.

188
00:18:40,024 --> 00:18:42,299
Mr. Lumumba,
I've received orders from Brussels.

189
00:18:43,384 --> 00:18:45,944
The Minister of Congo has requested

190
00:18:46,104 --> 00:18:49,176
that you are present at
the Round Table Conference.

191
00:18:50,144 --> 00:18:52,942
You are free to go.

192
00:18:53,504 --> 00:18:57,498
Tomorrow there is a plane to Brussels.
Take it.

193
00:19:08,865 --> 00:19:10,935
Patrice, welcome!

194
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,184
Good to see you.

195
00:19:21,506 --> 00:19:23,622
How are you?

196
00:19:25,826 --> 00:19:29,501
Will you go and meet Mr. Kasavubu?
- I will meet all Aboko representatives.

197
00:19:29,786 --> 00:19:32,539
How is your relationship with Mr. Kasavubu?
- Very good.

198
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:36,336
Do you want to meet with European investors?
- Of course.

199
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:40,501
What are your expectations?
- They are high.

200
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:43,545
Will you meet with the Belgian Ministers?

201
00:19:44,427 --> 00:19:47,737
I'm just a poor woman.
There are millions of us.

202
00:19:47,907 --> 00:19:51,058
In their name I salute a freedom fighter.

203
00:19:51,227 --> 00:19:52,262
Thank you, ma'am.

204
00:19:52,867 --> 00:19:54,903
Do you think the MNC has a chance?

205
00:20:06,348 --> 00:20:09,658
Were you wounded on board?
- In prison. It's nothing.

206
00:20:09,828 --> 00:20:12,661
Tell me about Brussels.
- It's a beautiful city.

207
00:20:12,828 --> 00:20:17,107
I mean the Round Table.
- Everyone is talking about you.

208
00:20:17,709 --> 00:20:19,779
Which room?
- Room three!

209
00:20:19,949 --> 00:20:21,826
There are no more oranges.

210
00:20:21,989 --> 00:20:23,183
Three Flamingos in 1926.

211
00:20:26,829 --> 00:20:29,343
Who goes to the third floor?
- Send Mathieu.

212
00:20:29,589 --> 00:20:31,420
I do Bomboko.

213
00:20:32,589 --> 00:20:33,817
What you see in this clown?

214
00:20:33,989 --> 00:20:35,422
He has class.
- No, gratuities.

215
00:20:35,749 --> 00:20:37,422
Make way!

216
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:39,428
There's work to be done.

217
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,068
No, no, no you can not leave now.
It's not over yet.

218
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:51,824
Back to top.
- Let us go.

219
00:20:54,070 --> 00:20:57,746
Mr. Lumumba will meet you at 7 pm
Not now.

220
00:20:57,911 --> 00:21:00,903
What do you mean
"Vague impulses independence"?

221
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,781
It's a reality.

222
00:21:06,191 --> 00:21:08,182
Yes, it is stretchable.

223
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:12,906
It is not our fault
that the date is not yet known.

224
00:21:18,752 --> 00:21:22,062
Mr. Kasavubu,
how nice to meet you.

225
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:30,188
I say that it is a crime.

226
00:21:30,552 --> 00:21:33,783
You attach too much importance to a word.

227
00:21:33,952 --> 00:21:36,989
Independence. A word?

228
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,872
God is a word
but I believe it.

229
00:21:40,033 --> 00:21:42,911
So we will end up giving the Congo to the Communists.

230
00:21:43,073 --> 00:21:44,870
As France did in Algeria.

231
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,903
Anyone without a political mandate
is to leave.

232
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:50,422
Men ...

233
00:21:54,473 --> 00:21:57,067
Joseph, did you hear me?
- I do not understand.

234
00:21:57,553 --> 00:22:01,513
I am a MNC deputy.
- But aren't you studying in Belgium?

235
00:22:01,794 --> 00:22:02,465
Yes, but ...

236
00:22:02,714 --> 00:22:05,353
This is for delegates from Congo.

237
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:08,023
I am a MNC deputy.

238
00:22:08,914 --> 00:22:12,224
Joseph, it is the Rules
of the Common Front.

239
00:22:21,515 --> 00:22:24,427
Let them experiment
with freedom.

240
00:22:25,235 --> 00:22:28,352
Either way they will give Africa 
one of two lessons,


241
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:31,666
The European example
of united, hardworking nation ...

242
00:22:32,395 --> 00:22:35,546
or the other primitive, that 
has been surpessed will return.

243
00:22:36,395 --> 00:22:37,953
And then ...

244
00:22:39,155 --> 00:22:40,271
And then?

245
00:22:41,916 --> 00:22:45,147
We have an army, militias,

246
00:22:45,916 --> 00:22:49,033
planes, tanks.

247
00:22:49,436 --> 00:22:51,472
We have the two largest parties.

248
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:54,992
We should take a common
position.

249
00:22:56,236 --> 00:22:59,991
You think to show a compromise?
Independence on June 15?

250
00:23:00,157 --> 00:23:02,227
The minister will refuse.

251
00:23:04,157 --> 00:23:07,194
Would you like us to give way on a date?

252
00:23:07,357 --> 00:23:10,030
A Common Front would give us
more coverage.

253
00:23:12,277 --> 00:23:14,233
They want to save time.

254
00:23:15,077 --> 00:23:16,635
Why?

255
00:23:16,877 --> 00:23:20,553
Do they need to prepare their retreat?
Or to plot against us?

256
00:23:20,878 --> 00:23:22,231
Conspiracy dismantlement?

257
00:23:22,398 --> 00:23:24,354
Union Miniere in Katanga.

258
00:23:24,558 --> 00:23:27,311
The copper, the diamonds ...

259
00:23:27,558 --> 00:23:29,753
They will leave that to our government?

260
00:23:29,918 --> 00:23:33,354
We have no government.

261
00:23:33,518 --> 00:23:35,156
Wait for the elections.

262
00:23:36,278 --> 00:23:38,155
We're not there yet.

263
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:42,958
I ask you

264
00:23:44,199 --> 00:23:46,793
What should they do with independence?

265
00:23:47,599 --> 00:23:50,557
It's not a nation, it strains already.

266
00:23:52,479 --> 00:23:54,595
The Lulua's hate the Baluba's

267
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,916
Baluba's hate and the Bakongo's.

268
00:23:58,079 --> 00:24:00,468
And canthe Bakongo and
the Bengala's tolerate eachother?

269
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,438
The colonial administration
holds them together.

270
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,474
And when that disappears.
- What then?

271
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:11,072
We must not make the same mistake as the French.
With their African executives.

272
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,111
Judges, police, the postal service.

273
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:17,354
All high positions are held by Belgians.
Without them, there will be chaos.

274
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,959
Good, good.

275
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,913
It is June 30 then.

276
00:24:22,401 --> 00:24:24,835
Independence's a fact.

277
00:24:25,401 --> 00:24:31,271
There remains one question:
will she be federalist, as you want,

278
00:24:31,441 --> 00:24:33,397
or unitarian, as I want.

279
00:24:33,561 --> 00:24:36,598
I will make a press release
and we will both sign.

280
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:40,069
Let me read the text first.

281
00:24:44,922 --> 00:24:48,198
Do you know the latest hit?

282
00:25:11,963 --> 00:25:15,273
Leopoldville, May 1960

283
00:25:22,724 --> 00:25:24,715
We won.
Their coalitions failed.

284
00:25:26,284 --> 00:25:28,923
We did well?
- Even better than Abako.

285
00:25:29,684 --> 00:25:31,083
In Leopoldville too?
- Of course not.

286
00:25:31,564 --> 00:25:34,397
What is "president", Daddy?
- Nothing. Eat.

287
00:26:20,766 --> 00:26:22,961
We must continue.
Until the end.

288
00:26:23,126 --> 00:26:26,085
You do not know what you say, Maurice.

289
00:26:26,647 --> 00:26:30,401
Anyway.
Half a revolution is not possible.

290
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:34,721
We must throw out the Flemish.

291
00:26:35,447 --> 00:26:37,403
Expropriate the missionaries.

292
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:40,919
Chase out all the parasites
All the officer castes.

293
00:26:41,087 --> 00:26:42,486
And who will replace them?

294
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:44,486
They can go to hell!

295
00:26:45,608 --> 00:26:46,597
We did not need them.

296
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,766
You will not have it easy.

297
00:26:57,928 --> 00:27:00,806
I know,
but one thing must be clear.

298
00:27:01,128 --> 00:27:05,281
Should I show a government form
or is it to be an information circular?

299
00:27:05,529 --> 00:27:08,999
an Information Round with an eye
to forming the government second.

300
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:10,966
I do not understand it yet.

301
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,927
The independence ceremony
is on June 30.

302
00:27:14,089 --> 00:27:18,002
If we have no government,
as my unofficial mission is ...

303
00:27:18,169 --> 00:27:21,559
It's an official mission.

304
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:25,559
Let me organize things
as I was told

305
00:27:25,730 --> 00:27:27,288
by His Majesty.

306
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:31,079
Information first, then formation.

307
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:32,968
All in good time.

308
00:27:34,650 --> 00:27:36,003
I will do my best.

309
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,164
But remember, time is short.

310
00:27:39,730 --> 00:27:43,359
Good luck, Mr. Information.

311
00:27:47,971 --> 00:27:52,044
I accuse Minister Ganshof
and the duplicity of the Belgian Government,

312
00:27:52,211 --> 00:27:54,122
which I consider as dangerous

313
00:27:54,291 --> 00:27:57,920
to me and the government I
want to form.

314
00:27:58,611 --> 00:28:01,921
Brussels prefers a Congo
without a leader on June 30

315
00:28:02,211 --> 00:28:04,167
Instead of a Lumumba government.

316
00:28:05,251 --> 00:28:06,924
In these circumstances

317
00:28:07,092 --> 00:28:09,925
there will be no head of state to
on June 30.

318
00:28:10,092 --> 00:28:12,128
Neither from my party nor our allies

319
00:28:12,292 --> 00:28:15,250
The appointment will need
Mr. Kasavubu approval.

320
00:28:16,532 --> 00:28:19,410
CONAKAT, but not Tshombe.

321
00:28:19,732 --> 00:28:21,768
The coalition will not stand days.

322
00:28:21,932 --> 00:28:25,288
Even as Commissioner of
the Katanga province?

323
00:28:25,452 --> 00:28:27,045
We can find better.

324
00:28:27,933 --> 00:28:32,211
For Finance I accept your candidate.
But I want Thomas Kanza

325
00:28:32,373 --> 00:28:34,250
as Minister at the V.N.

326
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:38,691
His father was last year
expelled from our party.

327
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:46,885
It gives me no pleasure.

328
00:28:47,134 --> 00:28:51,286
The son is not the father.
He'll do a good job.

329
00:29:17,255 --> 00:29:18,370
Gentlemen ...

330
00:29:20,615 --> 00:29:22,492
Today is the day.

331
00:29:35,896 --> 00:29:38,615
The Nationalist Block which I chair,

332
00:29:38,776 --> 00:29:42,530
will put forward the candidacy of Mr. Kasavubu

333
00:29:42,696 --> 00:29:45,335
for the post of President
of the Republic.

334
00:29:45,976 --> 00:29:50,209
I never disputed
that it deserves that title.

335
00:29:51,337 --> 00:29:55,649
My first act will be the appointment
Mr. Lumumba

336
00:29:55,817 --> 00:29:59,366
as Prime Minister of
the Government of National Unity.

337
00:29:59,617 --> 00:30:03,929
Unity, which is what the Congo
now needs.

338
00:30:24,058 --> 00:30:28,371
Is it not true that Katanga is not
represented in the government?

339
00:30:28,539 --> 00:30:30,450
Do you not fear separation?

340
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:34,498
Katanga is represented.
More than Tshombe in Katanga and Munungo.

341
00:30:34,659 --> 00:30:36,138
No more questions.

342
00:30:36,499 --> 00:30:38,808
Congo is united and will remain so.
Is that enough?

343
00:30:40,819 --> 00:30:43,936
United or not, we want to emphasize this.

344
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:46,175
And money! And comfort!

345
00:30:46,339 --> 00:30:49,491
And no more Flemish people who give orders!
No more bullying!

346
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:54,092
It's enough!
Moreover, we must cut their grass

347
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,610
and our wives do their dishes.

348
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:58,731
We get so little bit and we do everything.

349
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,653
Come on. Sit with us.

350
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,494
We can not directly change anything.

351
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,409
I asked for a general amnesty to the king
and promotions for you.

352
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,573
June 30 will be shown to be a memorable day.

353
00:31:11,741 --> 00:31:15,370
Without distinction of rank,
province or tribe.

354
00:31:15,541 --> 00:31:17,099
For the unified nation.

355
00:31:17,261 --> 00:31:18,489
United!

356
00:31:46,102 --> 00:31:48,172
I'm going to sleep. Until tomorrow.

357
00:31:53,863 --> 00:31:56,457
It's Tshombe and the full CONAKAT party.

358
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,818
I'll go back to Elizabeth City.

359
00:31:59,183 --> 00:32:02,459
Yesterday I waited all day
for the list of ministers.

360
00:32:02,623 --> 00:32:04,659
You promised me that you'd send them to me.

361
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,814
We sent them on.
- Liar!

362
00:32:06,983 --> 00:32:08,780
What's he saying?
- Slow down, Maurice.

363
00:32:09,183 --> 00:32:11,573
Apparently you already know the list?

364
00:32:11,864 --> 00:32:15,777
A lot of extremists.
We will use all the means of

365
00:32:16,064 --> 00:32:18,976
the unified structures of
the country to fight.

366
00:32:19,264 --> 00:32:20,413
All resources?

367
00:32:21,824 --> 00:32:24,782
And you will deny the democratic vote?
- I suppose you'd prefer Communism.

368
00:32:27,464 --> 00:32:29,853
Communism ...
We are no more communist than you

369
00:32:30,144 --> 00:32:32,534
Do not argue with them, Thomas. They are fascists.

370
00:32:33,305 --> 00:32:35,341
I do not like that tone!

371
00:32:49,345 --> 00:32:51,064
That's independence.

372
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:53,223
Well, we're not done.

373
00:32:56,226 --> 00:32:57,375
What a lot of dust!

374
00:32:59,586 --> 00:33:02,339
Can we be that bad that we
cannot leave a few paintings?

375
00:33:02,506 --> 00:33:06,340
But they are owned by the Belgian state.
It's a direct order.

376
00:33:11,026 --> 00:33:13,416
Run for your life. The Bantus are here.

377
00:33:15,267 --> 00:33:17,986
Sire, they give away your Congo
and make a pigsty.

378
00:33:21,507 --> 00:33:23,896
They even showed them the wine cellar.

379
00:33:25,947 --> 00:33:28,177
The governor has not bored of it.

380
00:33:39,668 --> 00:33:42,660
Does no one answer the phone?

381
00:33:51,748 --> 00:33:54,502
No, Governor Cornelis
does not live here anymore.

382
00:33:55,269 --> 00:33:57,783
He does not live here anymore.

383
00:33:57,949 --> 00:34:02,067
This is the residence of Patrice Lumumba,
Prime Minister of Congo.

384
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:10,778
Already five months
I have not slept.

385
00:34:12,469 --> 00:34:14,461
Are you tired, Daddy?

386
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,262
Give me that.

387
00:34:33,391 --> 00:34:36,269
Read this and tell me what you think.

388
00:34:40,551 --> 00:34:44,260
What time is it?
When will the car be here?

389
00:34:44,831 --> 00:34:48,870
It cannot happen, Sir!
And not because I chair the ceremony,

390
00:34:49,231 --> 00:34:51,791
but because it's provocative.

391
00:34:51,951 --> 00:34:53,351
Who provoked the first?

392
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:56,470
I have the speech of the King
and the President is not in support.

393
00:34:57,712 --> 00:35:00,180
They've refused an amnesty,

394
00:35:00,352 --> 00:35:03,424
A symbolic gesture

395
00:35:03,632 --> 00:35:06,021
that is essential for the ceremony.

396
00:35:06,832 --> 00:35:08,584
I appointed you as President
of the Senate

397
00:35:08,872 --> 00:35:12,626
because I thought you had character.
Am I to be made wrong?

398
00:35:12,792 --> 00:35:14,943
You need him to give the word.

399
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,662
Kasa Once is finished,
Patrice takes the microphone.

400
00:35:18,873 --> 00:35:21,307
They should stay and listen.

401
00:35:21,473 --> 00:35:25,432
You want the King, General Janssens,
the bishop ...

402
00:35:25,593 --> 00:35:27,390
The King, the General, the Bishop ...

403
00:35:27,553 --> 00:35:29,271
That I forgot.

404
00:35:29,433 --> 00:35:33,267
Exactly. Let them
listen to the truth.

405
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:36,392
That's something different. For everyone.

406
00:35:42,434 --> 00:35:43,389
Good.

407
00:35:44,394 --> 00:35:47,864
Patrice, do you really have to say?

408
00:35:48,474 --> 00:35:50,908
The independence of the Congo

409
00:35:51,514 --> 00:35:56,748
is the continuation of a process that resulted
from the genius of King Leopold I,

410
00:35:57,595 --> 00:36:01,224
by him with growing
courage a process started

411
00:36:01,635 --> 00:36:05,150
and was continued with conviction
by Belgium.

412
00:36:06,755 --> 00:36:12,034
When Leopold I began this enormous work,
now completed, 

413
00:36:12,635 --> 00:36:15,594
He did not do so as the conqueror

414
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:17,951
but as an advocate
of civilization.

415
00:36:18,436 --> 00:36:21,030
It's up to you, gentlemen,

416
00:36:21,356 --> 00:36:24,746
to prove that we were right
to trust you.

417
00:36:25,636 --> 00:36:28,673
Avoid the name of the King.

418
00:36:28,956 --> 00:36:30,833
Avoid rapid reforms

419
00:36:30,996 --> 00:36:34,671
and not replace Belgian institutions

420
00:36:34,956 --> 00:36:38,393
unless you are certain
you can do better.

421
00:36:38,797 --> 00:36:42,949
Gentlemen, the eyes of the world
are on you.

422
00:36:43,597 --> 00:36:46,475
May God protect the Congo!

423
00:36:59,078 --> 00:37:01,433
Excellencies, dear compatriots,

424
00:37:03,358 --> 00:37:05,474
Now, officially, the Republic of Congo

425
00:37:06,318 --> 00:37:07,956
appears on the world map,

426
00:37:08,638 --> 00:37:11,277
a fully independent and sovereign ...

427
00:37:11,718 --> 00:37:13,629
Patrice, it's too dangerous.

428
00:37:14,878 --> 00:37:16,756
You've improved.

429
00:37:16,919 --> 00:37:18,910
You know what you're doing?

430
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:24,189
Do you really think you can tackle them?
- You heard him.

431
00:37:24,559 --> 00:37:27,835
We must respond.
What will our children remember?

432
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:29,830
Kasa answers.

433
00:37:29,999 --> 00:37:32,911
Listen to what he says.

434
00:37:33,799 --> 00:37:34,993
Sire,

435
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:40,433
your presence
on this memorable day

436
00:37:41,120 --> 00:37:44,635
proves once again your concern

437
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:48,031
for the people you loved
and protected.

438
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,750
We will not disappoint you.

439
00:38:22,762 --> 00:38:25,481
My dear compatriots,

440
00:38:26,402 --> 00:38:30,031
victors
of the independence struggle,

441
00:38:31,402 --> 00:38:36,078
For this independence of the Congo, 
even as it is celebrated today with Belgium

442
00:38:36,242 --> 00:38:39,792
a friendly country with whom
we deal as equal to equal

443
00:38:40,803 --> 00:38:43,715
no Congolese worthy of the name 
will ever be able to forget 

444
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:46,397
that it was by fighting 
that it has been won

445
00:38:50,243 --> 00:38:51,676
a day-to-day fight,
an ardent and idealistic fight, 

446
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:55,876
a fight in which we were spared 
neither privation nor suffering, 

447
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:58,239
and for which we gave our strength 
and our blood.

448
00:38:59,324 --> 00:39:04,239
We are proud of this struggle, 
of tears, of fire, and of blood,

449
00:39:04,404 --> 00:39:06,156
to the depths of our being, 
for it was a noble and just struggle, 

450
00:39:06,404 --> 00:39:08,759
and indispensable to put an end 
to the humiliating slavery 

451
00:39:08,924 --> 00:39:11,438
which was imposed upon us by force

452
00:39:11,604 --> 00:39:13,640
because we were black.

453
00:39:14,124 --> 00:39:17,912
Who could forget the shootings
which claimed so many victims,

454
00:39:18,084 --> 00:39:20,474
the cells in which those
were locked up

455
00:39:20,645 --> 00:39:23,239
who escaped the bullets
of the soldiers

456
00:39:23,405 --> 00:39:25,441
that were used
to dominating us?

457
00:39:27,245 --> 00:39:28,758
All this, brethren,

458
00:39:29,245 --> 00:39:30,519
has made us suffer

459
00:39:31,645 --> 00:39:34,205
and our wounds are too fresh
and painful to erase

460
00:39:35,365 --> 00:39:38,277
them from our memory.

461
00:39:39,006 --> 00:39:42,999
All this, brethren,
we proclaim loudly,

462
00:39:43,246 --> 00:39:45,476
is now forever and ever
behind us.

463
00:39:46,446 --> 00:39:49,518
The Congolese Republic
has been declared.

464
00:39:49,766 --> 00:39:52,234
Our country belongs to our children.

465
00:39:53,206 --> 00:39:56,004
We are now all able to benefit 
from social justice

466
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:58,880
and our children will benefit
from our country.

467
00:40:03,767 --> 00:40:05,359
Your Majesty,

468
00:40:05,527 --> 00:40:08,644
Excellencies, Ladies and Gentlemen,

469
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:13,597
compatriots, fellow strugglers,
black brothers

470
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:15,997
that is what I have wanted to say.

471
00:40:16,487 --> 00:40:19,445
Long live independence
and African Unity!

472
00:40:19,648 --> 00:40:21,639
Long live the independent
Congo and its sovereignty!

473
00:40:54,249 --> 00:40:56,888
There! Let's get him
And teach him a lesson!

474
00:40:58,369 --> 00:40:59,324
Treason!

475
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:01,760
Get out!

476
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:09,883
Accelerate!

477
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:21,001
Let's go!

478
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:43,292
These are but isolated incidents.

479
00:41:43,452 --> 00:41:47,206
Hardy also has a rebel camp.
The officers have been taken hostage.

480
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:49,928
They want you

481
00:41:50,332 --> 00:41:52,641
They say they want to kill you.

482
00:41:52,972 --> 00:41:53,927
Unbelievable.

483
00:41:55,172 --> 00:41:57,128
What about Jones?

484
00:41:58,332 --> 00:41:59,526
Silence.

485
00:41:59,932 --> 00:42:02,686
Get your reports.
We will carry out all investigations calmly.

486
00:42:03,493 --> 00:42:05,449
Minister Mpolo.

487
00:42:08,133 --> 00:42:11,603
The Force Publique has 25,000 men.
They have stations

488
00:42:12,013 --> 00:42:14,288
aligned along the same wavelength.

489
00:42:14,493 --> 00:42:18,964
They know everything in each camp
before their officers.

490
00:42:19,253 --> 00:42:20,971
They are crazy!

491
00:42:21,774 --> 00:42:23,127
What do they want?

492
00:42:23,854 --> 00:42:25,765
They want promotions!

493
00:42:26,174 --> 00:42:27,812
I know, I heard them.

494
00:42:29,174 --> 00:42:34,123
If I may, Prime Minister, they are tired.
Five months on end:

495
00:42:34,454 --> 00:42:37,252
riots, celebrations ...
- The Flemish General,

496
00:42:37,494 --> 00:42:41,453
Janssens, puts them against us.
And he is against African officers.

497
00:42:41,614 --> 00:42:45,164
Let us shoot him.
- There is no replacement.

498
00:42:45,655 --> 00:42:47,213
I suggest Senator Lundula.

499
00:42:48,455 --> 00:42:52,289
And you, Mpolo as Colonel.
Let us take a vote.

500
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:55,089
I will not vote for someone
who wants to shoot anyone.

501
00:42:55,375 --> 00:42:57,093
Even that is not military.

502
00:42:57,615 --> 00:43:01,324
Mr. Prime Minister,
I was 7 years in the Force Publique.

503
00:43:02,616 --> 00:43:05,369
I do not deny his qualities,

504
00:43:05,656 --> 00:43:08,887
but I think I am more proficient ...
- An excellent suggestion.

505
00:43:09,456 --> 00:43:13,051
The new commander
must come from its own ranks.

506
00:43:14,976 --> 00:43:16,170
What is that?

507
00:43:23,457 --> 00:43:25,129
Let us in!

508
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:28,214
We want the minister to speak first!

509
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:36,647
They are crazy! What do they want?
Where is the military discipline?

510
00:43:36,817 --> 00:43:37,966
There they are!

511
00:43:46,058 --> 00:43:46,695
Excellence ...

512
00:43:47,458 --> 00:43:50,097
We do nothing. We have a petition.

513
00:43:51,058 --> 00:43:52,969
We want an answer. Directly from you.

514
00:44:03,498 --> 00:44:06,855
Give me the petition.
I will study it.

515
00:44:07,019 --> 00:44:09,089
No, Sir! We want an answer now!

516
00:44:12,019 --> 00:44:14,897
"We wish our military to be
disciplined to carry out our mission

517
00:44:15,579 --> 00:44:19,936
and accuse General Janssens
of unfair behavior.

518
00:44:20,659 --> 00:44:25,211
We demand honesty and impartiality,
which is impossible

519
00:44:25,740 --> 00:44:28,300
with officers in the Congolese army."

520
00:44:28,580 --> 00:44:30,855
You mean white officers?

521
00:44:31,140 --> 00:44:33,335
We do not want them!
- Black officers!

522
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,969
No officers!

523
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:39,739
I understand that you want equality and justice.

524
00:44:40,380 --> 00:44:42,496
But I do not yield weapons.

525
00:44:45,341 --> 00:44:47,855
I ask you to return
to your barracks.

526
00:44:48,301 --> 00:44:50,496
We have a strong,
obedient army.

527
00:44:55,061 --> 00:44:56,380
We've heard it all!

528
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:59,095
Jones speaks so!
- Answer now!

529
00:44:59,861 --> 00:45:02,739
You are not even in mutual agreement.

530
00:45:04,862 --> 00:45:07,012
I understand your indignation.

531
00:45:09,342 --> 00:45:12,379
And I will got to 
Leopold and speak to the camp,

532
00:45:12,782 --> 00:45:15,012
in the morning. You have my word.

533
00:45:18,102 --> 00:45:20,536
Now I ask you to return
to your barracks.

534
00:45:25,383 --> 00:45:26,782
Come on then, shoot.

535
00:45:36,463 --> 00:45:37,862
You will come to Camp Leopold?

536
00:45:38,623 --> 00:45:40,056
I promise you

537
00:45:46,024 --> 00:45:49,460
We have 15 white officers hostage
and their wives.

538
00:45:50,744 --> 00:45:51,972
If you do not come,

539
00:45:53,704 --> 00:45:54,898
We will murder them.

540
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:19,185
Gentlemen, the meeting is not over.

541
00:46:30,106 --> 00:46:33,018
Hey, you there!

542
00:46:33,226 --> 00:46:34,898
Damn Flemish!

543
00:46:40,066 --> 00:46:41,499
Wait!

544
00:46:49,347 --> 00:46:50,826
Maxence, come in!

545
00:46:50,987 --> 00:46:55,299
They do not scare me.
I will write down their numbers.

546
00:46:55,787 --> 00:46:57,425
You'll see what happens!

547
00:47:00,107 --> 00:47:01,426
Idiot!

548
00:47:04,547 --> 00:47:05,980
You hear me, motherfucker?

549
00:47:11,388 --> 00:47:12,980
Dork!

550
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:15,420
Losers!

551
00:47:16,388 --> 00:47:18,822
You're a disgrace' to the regiment.

552
00:47:20,028 --> 00:47:22,223
You are not alone.

553
00:47:22,388 --> 00:47:26,586
There are assholes everywhere,
across the province.

554
00:47:27,509 --> 00:47:30,307
In Madimba a 
white woman was raped.

555
00:47:31,109 --> 00:47:32,542
They were shot!

556
00:47:33,789 --> 00:47:36,019
You shame the Force Publique.

557
00:47:37,269 --> 00:47:40,659
You are arrested.
Take them away!

558
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,262
Let me be clear.

559
00:47:57,070 --> 00:48:00,540
Independence is for the citizens.

560
00:48:00,990 --> 00:48:04,380
For soldiers there is only discipline.

561
00:48:08,150 --> 00:48:11,427
Before June 30 you had
white officers.

562
00:48:12,071 --> 00:48:14,869
After June 30 you still
have white officers.

563
00:48:16,391 --> 00:48:21,749
It may be that the politicians said something
 else, but they lied.

564
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:25,225
I have always told the truth.

565
00:48:25,391 --> 00:48:28,508
And if you do not understand
I will write it for you.

566
00:48:30,592 --> 00:48:33,664
After independence

567
00:48:33,832 --> 00:48:37,620
equals
for independence.

568
00:48:38,112 --> 00:48:39,784
What are you saying, white?

569
00:48:40,992 --> 00:48:44,507
So you will not go.
They have deceived us.

570
00:48:44,792 --> 00:48:46,271
They lied.

571
00:48:49,033 --> 00:48:50,785
We will not go.

572
00:49:04,433 --> 00:49:06,105
Are you coming to bed?

573
00:49:06,273 --> 00:49:08,309
I must finish.

574
00:49:08,593 --> 00:49:10,983
You will sleep again at your desk.

575
00:49:11,234 --> 00:49:12,747
Do not worry.

576
00:49:13,554 --> 00:49:15,863
How can I not worry?

577
00:49:16,594 --> 00:49:18,869
You sleep no more than 2 hours a night.

578
00:49:20,354 --> 00:49:24,029
I will start to think
that you are actually using marijuana.

579
00:49:24,434 --> 00:49:25,992
They say that?

580
00:49:26,154 --> 00:49:29,864
You have no idea what
the servants tell me.

581
00:49:45,275 --> 00:49:48,153
You have to be strong
for the children.

582
00:49:52,876 --> 00:49:55,106
If something were to happen to me ...

583
00:50:11,397 --> 00:50:14,036
General, you know why you're here?

584
00:50:14,597 --> 00:50:15,825
I wait until you tell me.

585
00:50:16,157 --> 00:50:18,910
And I await your explanation.

586
00:50:20,277 --> 00:50:23,314
I got the telegram.
- That's obvious.

587
00:50:23,477 --> 00:50:25,115
Excellency!
- Excuse me?

588
00:50:25,437 --> 00:50:27,189
You say, Excellency.

589
00:50:28,717 --> 00:50:31,027
I want to know what you mean by:

590
00:50:31,878 --> 00:50:34,517
"I myself do not contradict
nor repeated.

591
00:50:35,638 --> 00:50:40,428
Please consider this
as a final warning. "

592
00:50:42,598 --> 00:50:46,386
A General in Belgium
obeys his superiors

593
00:50:46,678 --> 00:50:48,111
So speak?

594
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:51,828
Excuse me, sir.
In Belgium there is order.

595
00:50:52,439 --> 00:50:56,227
Here we are heading for disaster,
and there is chaos.

596
00:50:56,399 --> 00:50:59,038
Because your men and
your methods are tired.

597
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:04,232
The Force Publique has to change
like the rest.

598
00:51:04,399 --> 00:51:07,118
I expect your resignation.

599
00:51:07,279 --> 00:51:08,997
Mr. Lumumba ...

600
00:51:09,999 --> 00:51:12,639
Excellence ...
- I've said what I have to say ...

601
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:14,109
General.

602
00:51:52,241 --> 00:51:53,561
Get out!

603
00:52:02,762 --> 00:52:05,356
Flemish or Walloon?
- Walloons.

604
00:52:07,482 --> 00:52:09,438
100 francs.
- Why?

605
00:52:10,082 --> 00:52:11,834
What's going on?

606
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,954
Nothing.
- Why, sir?

607
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:42,719
The Belgian ambassador.

608
00:52:43,684 --> 00:52:45,481
Let him through the garden.

609
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:55,161
Do you have news, Mr. Ambassador?

610
00:52:55,325 --> 00:52:58,476
Nothing that you do not know.
It's bad.

611
00:53:00,165 --> 00:53:02,281
You were chased out of Camp Leopold.

612
00:53:02,445 --> 00:53:04,720
But order will be restored.

613
00:53:04,885 --> 00:53:06,921
I do not know what order you want,

614
00:53:07,085 --> 00:53:12,000
but I still cannot watch
while my countrymen are murdered.

615
00:53:12,765 --> 00:53:16,520
If you do not have the means, I do,

616
00:53:16,686 --> 00:53:18,404
and they are at your disposal.

617
00:53:20,286 --> 00:53:22,277
An intervention?
- The situation is serious.

618
00:53:22,806 --> 00:53:24,603
You can ask assistance from Belgium.

619
00:53:25,206 --> 00:53:28,596
You have the right.
- I have a different opinion.

620
00:53:28,886 --> 00:53:33,038
If you refuse, I will have to
consult with our Atlantic partners.

621
00:53:34,206 --> 00:53:37,005
Do you understand?
- Not yet.

622
00:53:37,607 --> 00:53:39,484
But this is what I've decided.

623
00:53:41,647 --> 00:53:46,482
First, General Janssens
should leave Congo within 24 hours.

624
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:50,322
Secondly, you should warn him
and guarantee his departure.

625
00:53:50,607 --> 00:53:54,999
Thirdly, you are responsible
for his actions during his departure.

626
00:53:56,848 --> 00:54:00,682
He served Congo, Your Excellency.
He deserves respect

627
00:54:00,968 --> 00:54:02,560
and courtesy.
- Courtesy!

628
00:54:04,648 --> 00:54:08,607
It's the fault of the Belgians:
the uprising in the Camp, in this City

629
00:54:08,768 --> 00:54:11,328
Camp Leopold, Elizabeth City ...

630
00:54:11,488 --> 00:54:14,286
You spread rumours
of a Soviet invasion...

631
00:54:14,448 --> 00:54:17,247
Since the beginning
You've worked to conspire against me.

632
00:54:17,409 --> 00:54:20,446
And now you threaten me with the U.N. and NATO

633
00:54:20,609 --> 00:54:23,681
In the middle of the night
to the Prime Minister!

634
00:54:23,929 --> 00:54:26,841
Tomorrow I will hold a press conference

635
00:54:27,009 --> 00:54:29,648
and make your conspiracy, threats
and insults public.

636
00:54:29,809 --> 00:54:32,084
I've been advised
to go to Brazzaville,

637
00:54:32,249 --> 00:54:36,880
but count me out.
Belgians will murder me there.

638
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:42,483
I complain and you become angry.
Allow me but I find that strange.

639
00:54:42,810 --> 00:54:45,199
Then, I would ask you to leave.

640
00:54:51,170 --> 00:54:54,082
I hereby absolve General Janssens.

641
00:54:54,290 --> 00:54:56,725
For his own good and safety.

642
00:54:57,451 --> 00:55:00,249
I ask him the travel by air
at the first available opportunity.

643
00:55:01,411 --> 00:55:05,768
I appoint Major Victor Lundula to
Supreme Commander of the Force Publique

644
00:55:05,931 --> 00:55:08,923
I have also promoted Joseph Mobutu
to colonel.

645
00:55:09,131 --> 00:55:12,680
The Force Publique is now
The Congolese National Army.

646
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,762
The Belgians are worried.

647
00:55:15,171 --> 00:55:17,447
How will you fight the atrocities?

648
00:55:18,292 --> 00:55:20,362
These difficulties are inevitable.

649
00:55:20,532 --> 00:55:24,207
They are caused by a few 
agitators and a big misunderstanding.

650
00:55:24,612 --> 00:55:29,242
I have decided to stop them
President Kasavubu and myself

651
00:55:29,412 --> 00:55:33,724
I will make a journey of peace
throughout the country.

652
00:55:33,892 --> 00:55:36,008
Are you going to Katanga?
- Everywhere.

653
00:55:36,172 --> 00:55:40,371
Elisabethville, Coquilhatstad,
Stanleyville, Luluaburg ...

654
00:55:41,013 --> 00:55:43,083
But I warn the
Belgian Government

655
00:55:43,493 --> 00:55:46,485
the situation
must not be misused

656
00:55:46,813 --> 00:55:49,725
for a military intervention or 
to encourage riots.

657
00:55:50,493 --> 00:55:53,087
Only had work can make us move forward.

658
00:55:54,453 --> 00:55:56,250
Those who refuse to see

659
00:55:56,933 --> 00:56:00,244
and sabotage us,
are enemies of the people.

660
00:56:00,414 --> 00:56:03,326
What does Mr. Tshombe say about it?
- Will you go to U.N. ?

661
00:56:08,814 --> 00:56:13,126
"Katanga, our beautiful and prosperous
Province, the largest source ...

662
00:56:13,814 --> 00:56:16,851
... The main source
of our wealth. "

663
00:56:19,975 --> 00:56:22,967
What time is it in Elizabeth City?
Just as late in Luluaburg?

664
00:56:23,135 --> 00:56:26,013
No idea. I only hope that this
is the last stop.

665
00:56:27,935 --> 00:56:29,163
We've travelled everywhere, all in 10 days.

666
00:56:30,015 --> 00:56:31,767
I'm tired of this plane.

667
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:36,413
Congo is too big for us.

668
00:56:36,575 --> 00:56:39,568
Do not say that. Congo is big

669
00:56:39,736 --> 00:56:42,887
and requires great things.
But it is not too large.

670
00:56:43,896 --> 00:56:46,456
"Who says secession, says treason."

671
00:56:50,696 --> 00:56:51,731
We're descending?

672
00:56:51,896 --> 00:56:55,855
Airport Elizabeth City
refuses to let us land.

673
00:57:06,577 --> 00:57:09,011
I repeat, you can not land.

674
00:57:09,657 --> 00:57:11,249
Orders from the government of Katanga.

675
00:57:11,417 --> 00:57:12,611
What government?

676
00:57:12,777 --> 00:57:15,416
This is it. Secession.

677
00:57:15,977 --> 00:57:21,575
We can receive President Kasa Vubu,
but the traitor Patrice Lumumba

678
00:57:21,858 --> 00:57:24,816
will never set foot in Katanga.
- That's Munongo.

679
00:57:24,978 --> 00:57:26,809
Begin our descent.
- Impossible.

680
00:57:26,978 --> 00:57:28,536
Do what I say!
- Impossible.

681
00:57:28,698 --> 00:57:30,734
They have placed a truck
on the runway.

682
00:57:30,898 --> 00:57:34,254
We can not but go back.

683
00:57:46,539 --> 00:57:48,973
We have underestimated Tshombe.

684
00:57:52,619 --> 00:57:54,575
He does not do this alone.

685
00:57:55,499 --> 00:57:57,649
The Belgians have encouraged him.

686
00:57:59,179 --> 00:58:01,296
What do we do now?

687
00:58:01,460 --> 00:58:04,418
We can choose
war, shame, resignation

688
00:58:04,580 --> 00:58:06,935
and the loss of 70%
of our resources.

689
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,979
We have no choice.
We must suppress the uprising.

690
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:16,409
By Union Miniere, the entire financial
world is involved.

691
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:21,097
Imagine. The whole of Katanga.
It's 16 times bigger than Belgium.

692
00:58:22,261 --> 00:58:25,571
They do not get such a gift.
We will call on the U.N..

693
00:58:27,781 --> 00:58:29,453
Is that the best solution?

694
00:58:30,181 --> 00:58:33,093
For a military operation
the Russians ...

695
00:58:33,261 --> 00:58:38,096
The Russians, and have them say that I a 
Communist puppet. The CIA would surely murder me?

696
00:58:42,222 --> 00:58:42,972
What a calm.

697
00:58:44,782 --> 00:58:47,057
It is wonderful, the silence.

698
00:59:15,183 --> 00:59:18,619
Why are we going to Njili?
We said Stanleyville.

699
00:59:19,183 --> 00:59:21,254
I got other directions.

700
00:59:21,424 --> 00:59:25,178
You are under our command.
We decide not you.

701
00:59:25,704 --> 00:59:28,377
I am Belgian, Excellency.

702
00:59:44,505 --> 00:59:45,824
Attention!

703
00:59:48,505 --> 00:59:51,656
Mr. President, Where do you 
want the troops to take up position?

704
00:59:54,545 --> 00:59:56,058
Is it a trap.

705
00:59:57,065 --> 01:00:00,375
It is strange that the President
has these troops to behold?

706
01:00:00,905 --> 01:00:02,419
No way!

707
01:00:04,546 --> 01:00:06,776
Go provide a car.

708
01:00:07,226 --> 01:00:08,136
Mr. President,

709
01:00:08,426 --> 01:00:11,498
our troops are here
in order to honor and protect you.

710
01:00:12,146 --> 01:00:13,579
You need them to take up position.

711
01:00:13,746 --> 01:00:16,385
We refuse. You are no longer with you

712
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:18,104
Mr. President,

713
01:00:18,266 --> 01:00:22,260
We welcome you with the honor
you deserve.

714
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:24,979
Never mind. Go away.

715
01:00:25,427 --> 01:00:29,739
Mr. President, you do not speak
against "one" Belgian officer.

716
01:00:29,987 --> 01:00:33,536
Look at those women.
They were raped by your troops.

717
01:00:33,747 --> 01:00:37,979
Our men were assaulted.
You shame Africa and the world.

718
01:00:39,547 --> 01:00:42,745
We are here to protect our citizens.
There should be no flow of blood.

719
01:00:42,988 --> 01:00:46,139
If blood is flowing tonight,
you are responsible.

720
01:00:50,588 --> 01:00:52,021
Murderers!
- Bastards!

721
01:00:56,868 --> 01:00:58,267
Murderers, sadists!

722
01:00:58,988 --> 01:01:01,707
You raped nuns
and white women!

723
01:01:10,109 --> 01:01:11,622
The humiliation would not end.

724
01:01:12,709 --> 01:01:16,941
They were ready for anything.
Even sacrificing their own citizens.

725
01:01:17,669 --> 01:01:21,059
They needed someone to blame
for all this.

726
01:01:21,789 --> 01:01:26,022
They had, at any cost,
the rebel silenced.

727
01:01:33,950 --> 01:01:35,303
Hands on your head!

728
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:36,625
Out!

729
01:01:38,510 --> 01:01:40,341
Get down!

730
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:42,666
Paratroopers!

731
01:01:43,230 --> 01:01:46,109
The Belgian paratroopers are everywhere!

732
01:01:46,951 --> 01:01:48,748
The white officers have
hidden the ammunition!

733
01:01:49,351 --> 01:01:53,708
They removed the paratroopers there!
Send troops to the airport!

734
01:01:53,951 --> 01:01:55,543
Let the Russians come are not countries!

735
01:01:55,831 --> 01:01:57,787
They've evacuated their families!

736
01:01:58,351 --> 01:01:59,830
They will kill us all!

737
01:02:24,433 --> 01:02:26,071
Is this photograph necessary?

738
01:02:26,233 --> 01:02:28,189
Do not worry.
We'll pay for everything.

739
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:32,302
It will be in every ministry,

740
01:02:32,593 --> 01:02:33,469
every school

741
01:02:33,753 --> 01:02:35,027
every store and bar.

742
01:02:37,393 --> 01:02:38,508
Excuse me.

743
01:02:40,393 --> 01:02:42,987
We will not make it.
We follow him in two months.

744
01:02:45,314 --> 01:02:48,033
Fix it?
- It's war, Patrice.

745
01:02:48,394 --> 01:02:50,510
The U.N. is talking about genocide.

746
01:02:50,674 --> 01:02:52,744
The U.N. is manipulated
the U.S.A..

747
01:02:52,914 --> 01:02:55,667
Anyway,
There are hundreds of deaths.

748
01:02:55,994 --> 01:02:59,589
You had Kasai recaptured
with no organized massacre.

749
01:02:59,954 --> 01:03:01,831
And what have you achieved?

750
01:03:01,994 --> 01:03:04,428
Most of leaders
have fled to Katanga.

751
01:03:05,195 --> 01:03:07,834
We checked Kasai.
- It was one massacre.

752
01:03:09,595 --> 01:03:12,587
War means killing, kill
or be killed. That's the price.

753
01:03:12,755 --> 01:03:13,870
Who pays?

754
01:03:14,275 --> 01:03:15,708
Always the same!

755
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,991
So far I've got you covered.

756
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:21,186
But I do not support such atrocities.

757
01:03:23,675 --> 01:03:25,792
Mr. Prime Minister ...
- Enough comedy!

758
01:03:35,196 --> 01:03:38,393
I am a soldier and an officer.
I have proven this.

759
01:03:38,716 --> 01:03:40,832
I took over the Force Publique.

760
01:03:40,996 --> 01:03:44,193
I follow orders ... if any.

761
01:03:44,716 --> 01:03:46,514
And if there are none ...

762
01:03:48,477 --> 01:03:50,069
I make my own decisions.

763
01:03:53,917 --> 01:03:56,954
Women, children,

764
01:03:57,877 --> 01:04:01,267
old people. Trapped in a church
and killed?

765
01:04:01,957 --> 01:04:03,868
Is that what you decided?

766
01:04:07,278 --> 01:04:08,347
Answer!

767
01:04:09,358 --> 01:04:11,872
No, obviously not.

768
01:04:13,758 --> 01:04:15,350
But this is war.

769
01:04:15,838 --> 01:04:17,954
And a war is always dirty.

770
01:04:19,478 --> 01:04:21,469
It makes people crazy with fear.

771
01:04:23,198 --> 01:04:27,317
And at such times
orders are useless.

772
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:30,155
You let it happen.

773
01:04:31,199 --> 01:04:33,190
You have not executed the guilty.

774
01:04:33,359 --> 01:04:35,589
Do you know what that will cost?

775
01:04:36,399 --> 01:04:39,391
I will be held responsible.

776
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:43,670
You will isolate me even more.

777
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:46,512
You're not alone. I'm on your side.

778
01:04:54,680 --> 01:04:56,591
You're not by my side.

779
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,317
You stand behind me.

780
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:03,876
I do not want a murderer by my side,

781
01:05:04,040 --> 01:05:05,871
and certainly not behind me.

782
01:05:13,881 --> 01:05:15,553
What do you mean?

783
01:05:19,321 --> 01:05:21,232
You should go!

784
01:05:23,561 --> 01:05:25,119
Is that clear?

785
01:06:16,924 --> 01:06:18,516
That's it.

786
01:06:18,804 --> 01:06:19,634
Good.

787
01:06:21,484 --> 01:06:22,917
Very well. Directly.

788
01:06:29,325 --> 01:06:31,793
The president can see you now.

789
01:06:35,965 --> 01:06:39,162
Mr. Timberlake, nice to see you.

790
01:06:39,685 --> 01:06:42,324
I tried to reach you
at the embassy.

791
01:06:42,485 --> 01:06:45,477
I am far away.
- Everyone is lately.

792
01:06:46,205 --> 01:06:49,083
My government has a proposal.
- A proposal?

793
01:06:49,646 --> 01:06:54,037
I want to listen, but I doubt
the reliability of the U.S..

794
01:06:54,566 --> 01:06:57,683
You've probably heard the Bantu proverb:

795
01:06:57,966 --> 01:06:59,638
"The hand that gives, prevails."

796
01:07:00,126 --> 01:07:03,914
And your hand to me seems 
far too heavy. Excuse me.

797
01:07:06,246 --> 01:07:08,282
Mr. Prime Minister ...

798
01:07:09,446 --> 01:07:11,881
I am very worried.

799
01:07:12,607 --> 01:07:15,440
The Congolese army ...
- I know.

800
01:07:15,807 --> 01:07:18,480
The slaughter in Kasai.
I am appalled.

801
01:07:18,647 --> 01:07:21,002
I'm talking to the guilty.

802
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:22,885
The Congo is not.

803
01:07:23,047 --> 01:07:25,959
The problem remains with Katanga.

804
01:07:26,127 --> 01:07:29,642
Our undisciplined troops
have committed atrocities

805
01:07:29,807 --> 01:07:33,642
and U.N. betrays us
by giving passive support to the Belgians.

806
01:07:34,928 --> 01:07:38,716
Ghana supports us, along with Guinea 
but they have no money.

807
01:07:48,248 --> 01:07:49,966
Do you have a solution?

808
01:07:52,049 --> 01:07:53,482
The Russians.

809
01:07:54,649 --> 01:07:58,005
They promise us airplanes,
military advisers ...

810
01:07:58,369 --> 01:07:59,927
And troops for Lundula.

811
01:08:00,569 --> 01:08:03,163
He will replace Mobutu, whom I distrust.

812
01:08:03,329 --> 01:08:06,401
Were you not afraid that the Russians
would bring you into disrepute?

813
01:08:06,689 --> 01:08:09,362
That was long ago.
We were already discredited.

814
01:08:15,050 --> 01:08:16,961
What a beautiful place.

815
01:08:17,970 --> 01:08:19,449
And so quiet.

816
01:08:20,810 --> 01:08:24,405
I must insist.
May I ask the Russians?

817
01:08:24,810 --> 01:08:28,166
I'd like to go with a better plan.
If you have one I'll run with it immediately.

818
01:08:37,211 --> 01:08:38,769
I have none.

819
01:09:53,295 --> 01:09:55,490
Joseph, now you have your own men ...

820
01:09:55,655 --> 01:09:58,215
As long as they are paid ...
- Paid and trained.

821
01:09:59,135 --> 01:10:02,332
We're investing in
Congo's future.

822
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:04,804
The future for us all.

823
01:10:04,975 --> 01:10:07,489
I'll be honest with you

824
01:10:07,655 --> 01:10:11,489
Kasavubu has disappointed us.
And Lumumba is in charge.

825
01:10:11,775 --> 01:10:14,734
We need someone who
will work with us.

826
01:10:16,496 --> 01:10:17,565
I've been thinking.

827
01:10:18,976 --> 01:10:20,773
I think about it constantly.

828
01:10:22,496 --> 01:10:24,805
I guarantee you everything.

829
01:10:25,136 --> 01:10:27,331
Eisenhower?
- Kennedy.

830
01:10:35,577 --> 01:10:37,215
What will I win there?

831
01:10:37,897 --> 01:10:39,296
Everything.

832
01:10:45,337 --> 01:10:48,932
We interrupt our program
to air a statement from the President.

833
01:10:49,137 --> 01:10:53,369
Value compatriots,
Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba,

834
01:10:53,537 --> 01:10:58,248
appointed by the Belgian king
has denied his role.

835
01:10:58,498 --> 01:11:00,773
He has ruled in an arbitrary manner.

836
01:11:00,938 --> 01:11:06,058
He drags the country into
in a terrible civil war.

837
01:11:06,218 --> 01:11:11,292
Hence I think it is necessary
that it must end immediately.

838
01:11:11,618 --> 01:11:16,977
I ask the Congolese army and our
brothers to stop the killings

839
01:11:17,699 --> 01:11:20,133
and that the weapons across the republic

840
01:11:20,419 --> 01:11:22,933
to fall temporarily silent.

841
01:11:23,299 --> 01:11:24,493
Where's Justin?
- Gone to eat.

842
01:11:24,659 --> 01:11:26,217
And Dieudonn?
- Yet again.

843
01:11:26,379 --> 01:11:29,928
There's nobody here.
Take the car keys.

844
01:11:32,779 --> 01:11:34,816
Where are you going?
- Parliament.

845
01:11:57,941 --> 01:12:02,139
What is happening is outrageous!
Mr. Kasavubu

846
01:12:02,421 --> 01:12:05,970
can not dissolve what has been 
elected by the people!

847
01:12:06,381 --> 01:12:08,849
We turned to no effort.

848
01:12:09,021 --> 01:12:12,696
For the moment the Congo
has enjoyed the admiration of the world

849
01:12:13,221 --> 01:12:18,057
Kasavubu has given us a heavy blow
and has dragged the Congo through the mud.

850
01:12:25,782 --> 01:12:27,932
Silence!

851
01:12:28,862 --> 01:12:31,012
The Prime Minister has the word.

852
01:12:43,383 --> 01:12:47,217
Mr. President,
respectable gentlemen,

853
01:12:48,623 --> 01:12:54,175
I speak to you because it is my duty
to inform you of events.

854
01:12:54,343 --> 01:12:55,776
Too late!
- Congratulations!

855
01:12:55,943 --> 01:12:58,538
I've never been against Kasavubu.

856
01:12:58,984 --> 01:13:03,853
In any case, because
He is president and because of my actions.

857
01:13:04,384 --> 01:13:06,659
It's true!
- Easy to say!

858
01:13:08,344 --> 01:13:11,620
Some delegates,
also in opposition, do not agree

859
01:13:11,824 --> 01:13:14,463
and say that he is a separatist.

860
01:13:14,624 --> 01:13:17,697
The danger they fear is a reality.

861
01:13:19,265 --> 01:13:21,142
He's right.

862
01:13:21,305 --> 01:13:27,653
If the elected representatives of the people demand
Kasavubu to leave, he is deposed.

863
01:13:27,825 --> 01:13:29,019
Do it!

864
01:13:30,625 --> 01:13:34,334
Millions were spent

865
01:13:34,705 --> 01:13:37,345
on radio campaign against me.

866
01:13:37,506 --> 01:13:41,385
Every day there has been
a psychological battle fought.

867
01:13:42,306 --> 01:13:45,139
In order to mislead the people
I have been named

868
01:13:45,306 --> 01:13:49,936
Dictator Lumumba, Lumumba Communist,
Lumumba Moscow etc.

869
01:13:50,866 --> 01:13:55,542
When we fought in the early days
for our independence,

870
01:13:55,786 --> 01:13:58,096
was I prompted by the Russians?

871
01:13:58,987 --> 01:14:03,538
Did I ask the Russians to
the independence negotiations?

872
01:14:05,107 --> 01:14:07,940
Who has given us 80 years of exploitation?

873
01:14:08,467 --> 01:14:10,298
We are not the imperialists?

874
01:14:11,187 --> 01:14:15,897
Queen Elizabeth is President of
the Belgian-Russian association.

875
01:14:16,107 --> 01:14:17,506
Does it show me to be a Communist?

876
01:14:21,428 --> 01:14:23,623
If they hold Lumumba in contempt,

877
01:14:24,468 --> 01:14:27,858
Lumumba then is the black sheep.

878
01:14:28,828 --> 01:14:33,299
But actually they go on to attack
the future of the Congo.

879
01:14:35,908 --> 01:14:37,546
Dear brothers,

880
01:14:38,189 --> 01:14:40,180
I appeal to your wisdom,

881
01:14:40,509 --> 01:14:42,147
your Bantu wisdom.

882
01:14:42,989 --> 01:14:45,867
The situation is worse than you think.

883
01:14:46,829 --> 01:14:50,788
We must unite, because 
divided we cannot save our country.

884
01:14:51,989 --> 01:14:54,549
Let us forget our divisions.

885
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:18,309
Pauline?

886
01:15:20,591 --> 01:15:23,424
Acute hepatitis.
We need urgent action.

887
01:15:41,112 --> 01:15:44,343
Have you seen her?
- A Treasure. She looks like you.

888
01:15:45,432 --> 01:15:46,911
What will she be called?

889
01:15:47,072 --> 01:15:49,381
I thought of Marie-Christine.

890
01:15:54,512 --> 01:15:56,070
They will bring her to Switzerland.

891
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:59,112
They say it's her only chance.

892
01:15:59,272 --> 01:16:00,626
They hid that from me.

893
01:16:04,553 --> 01:16:06,862
I want my baby.

894
01:17:09,196 --> 01:17:11,073
You were not in Parliament.

895
01:17:11,236 --> 01:17:12,305
What is it?
- The thick ...

896
01:17:13,236 --> 01:17:15,955
The President wants me to arrest you.

897
01:17:16,436 --> 01:17:18,074
I wanted to warn you.

898
01:17:25,277 --> 01:17:28,713
And you say I'm involved 
I am a soldier.

899
01:17:29,317 --> 01:17:32,036
I never butt in 
on political conflicts.

900
01:17:32,197 --> 01:17:34,586
Have your men surrounded the house?

901
01:17:35,837 --> 01:17:36,792
A Security measure.

902
01:17:37,637 --> 01:17:40,993
I am not under arrest,
but my house is surrounded?

903
01:17:41,998 --> 01:17:44,353
For your own safety.

904
01:17:45,558 --> 01:17:47,594
Many people want you dead.

905
01:17:48,038 --> 01:17:52,589
My wife or my supporters,
Whom should I fear?

906
01:17:53,078 --> 01:17:55,467
Send your men away.
- Is that a request or will you show me a warrant?

907
01:17:55,758 --> 01:17:58,192
It's an order!
- Kasa you have been deposed.

908
01:17:58,878 --> 01:18:01,312
And for you, he is not president anymore.

909
01:18:02,839 --> 01:18:04,557
What would you do in my place?

910
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:10,949
I know you. This decision
is not yours alone.

911
01:18:15,639 --> 01:18:17,595
Who stands behind you?

912
01:18:18,839 --> 01:18:19,749
Who?

913
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,277
Out of this impasse

914
01:18:24,440 --> 01:18:28,319
the army has neutralized
President Kasavubu and

915
01:18:29,280 --> 01:18:32,636
Lumumba as Prime Minister.

916
01:18:34,720 --> 01:18:36,836
This is not a military coup,

917
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:39,960
just a peaceful revolution.

918
01:18:40,680 --> 01:18:42,990
Will there be free elections?

919
01:18:50,521 --> 01:18:52,671
But politicians have been arrested?

920
01:18:52,841 --> 01:18:54,559
Is this a coup?

921
01:18:59,721 --> 01:19:02,394
No military power will take control.

922
01:19:03,442 --> 01:19:05,080
Again, this is not a coup.

923
01:19:05,242 --> 01:19:08,518
What are the Americans doing?
- Involved in a Peaceful Revolution.

924
01:19:09,282 --> 01:19:13,275
We are neutral Congolese
and foreign technicians,

925
01:19:13,522 --> 01:19:16,400
we chose them, to
ask for help to save our country.

926
01:19:17,322 --> 01:19:18,880
Long live General Mobutu!

927
01:19:19,042 --> 01:19:20,555
Not so fast.

928
01:19:22,122 --> 01:19:25,718
Where's Lumumba?
- Do you support the Belgians?

929
01:19:25,883 --> 01:19:27,714
How is payment reform going?

930
01:19:27,883 --> 01:19:29,714
Has Lumumba been convicted?

931
01:19:35,763 --> 01:19:38,755
The phone is still working,
but for how long?

932
01:19:39,643 --> 01:19:42,237
I will not wait until I am isolated.

933
01:19:44,284 --> 01:19:46,559
There's a simple solution.

934
01:19:46,724 --> 01:19:49,602
We go to Stanleyville
and start from scratch.

935
01:19:49,764 --> 01:19:50,435
Why?

936
01:19:58,604 --> 01:20:01,277
We are neutralized.
and I'm trapped

937
01:20:01,444 --> 01:20:04,083
and Mr. Kasavubu's a free man.

938
01:20:06,005 --> 01:20:08,758
Katanga? You're kidding.

939
01:20:11,125 --> 01:20:13,685
If you want to drown your dog ...

940
01:20:14,685 --> 01:20:16,482
then you don't torture 
him with shallow water.

941
01:20:29,926 --> 01:20:31,678
Yes, I'm still here.

942
01:20:32,206 --> 01:20:33,434
Excuse me.

943
01:20:34,086 --> 01:20:36,805
I just read that my daughter
has died.

944
01:20:38,326 --> 01:20:40,362
I can not even go to her funeral.

945
01:20:50,927 --> 01:20:52,440
I cannot do anything.

946
01:21:26,729 --> 01:21:28,367
Thomas, it's you.

947
01:21:30,209 --> 01:21:33,565
I am determined.
We cannot tay here any longer.

948
01:21:34,809 --> 01:21:36,083
Yes, I know.

949
01:21:36,449 --> 01:21:39,441
I cannot stay here
under house arrest

950
01:21:39,609 --> 01:21:41,964
while my supporters are being killed.

951
01:21:44,049 --> 01:21:46,085
Are you safe?

952
01:21:49,050 --> 01:21:50,403
Listen ...

953
01:21:52,650 --> 01:21:54,720
One of us must make a sacrifice.

954
01:21:58,610 --> 01:22:02,080
I will definitely be arrested,
tortured and murdered.

955
01:22:04,770 --> 01:22:07,569
It's a sacrifice for the people.

956
01:22:10,051 --> 01:22:11,882
Well, Thomas.

957
01:22:13,611 --> 01:22:15,010
Do not worry.

958
01:22:20,011 --> 01:22:22,923
Forget what I just said.
It was a joke.

959
01:23:15,454 --> 01:23:16,807
Alphonse ...

960
01:23:17,254 --> 01:23:19,893
I've a parcel to get?

961
01:23:20,094 --> 01:23:22,005
I'll be right back.

962
01:23:30,375 --> 01:23:32,843
I smoke the American brand.

963
01:23:33,895 --> 01:23:35,044
Damn rain!

964
01:23:35,775 --> 01:23:37,845
Runs right past your neck.

965
01:25:57,622 --> 01:26:00,216
You must leave the main road.

966
01:26:00,382 --> 01:26:04,978
The checkpoint at Kasimba
saw a convoy.

967
01:26:05,742 --> 01:26:07,892
How far from here?
- 16 km.

968
01:26:08,262 --> 01:26:09,615
Maybe less.

969
01:26:10,102 --> 01:26:11,456
Thank you, comrade.

970
01:26:45,944 --> 01:26:47,377
There is no boat.

971
01:26:48,344 --> 01:26:50,414
We'll use the canoes.

972
01:26:50,584 --> 01:26:52,701
And how is it on the other side?

973
01:26:54,825 --> 01:26:57,623
We look for cars
or continue on foot.

974
01:27:04,585 --> 01:27:06,143
No Patrice, I'm not going first.

975
01:27:06,305 --> 01:27:07,658
Quick!
- I risk nothing.

976
01:27:07,825 --> 01:27:09,622
They're hot on our heels!

977
01:27:10,145 --> 01:27:11,658
I'll wait for the boat.

978
01:27:18,946 --> 01:27:20,174
We leave.

979
01:27:58,468 --> 01:27:59,947
Who are they?

980
01:28:02,268 --> 01:28:03,257
I cannot see.

981
01:28:03,988 --> 01:28:05,182
I must go back.
- No!

982
01:28:06,068 --> 01:28:07,501
That is pure madness!

983
01:28:09,388 --> 01:28:12,061
It is your task to reach Stanleyville.

984
01:28:12,228 --> 01:28:15,062
And let them take revenge
on my family?

985
01:28:15,349 --> 01:28:17,817
What will they say?
- That's suicide.

986
01:28:18,029 --> 01:28:20,384
They are not numerous. They will listen.

987
01:28:23,189 --> 01:28:25,305
You ungrateful creatures!

988
01:28:26,789 --> 01:28:28,541
This is pure madness!

989
01:29:11,511 --> 01:29:14,025
Chief, we wish you no harm.

990
01:29:14,351 --> 01:29:17,185
But if we return without you,

991
01:29:17,472 --> 01:29:18,985
we are slain.

992
01:29:19,152 --> 01:29:21,382
And now they will kill me.

993
01:29:21,552 --> 01:29:25,181
You still have regrets.

994
01:29:25,472 --> 01:29:28,145
I gave you the power
of the Force Publique.

995
01:29:29,032 --> 01:29:31,262
When I die, you are also dead.

996
01:29:31,552 --> 01:29:34,749
He's right.
- I'm for Lumumba.

997
01:29:34,912 --> 01:29:37,347
Stop this nonsense!

998
01:29:37,913 --> 01:29:39,710
Excuse me, Chief,

999
01:29:39,993 --> 01:29:41,506
but we recommend ...

1000
01:30:42,716 --> 01:30:44,354
Where were you arrested?

1001
01:30:48,996 --> 01:30:50,429
What about your children?

1002
01:31:56,839 --> 01:31:58,159
What?

1003
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:01,917
Cannibal.

1004
01:32:57,602 --> 01:33:00,197
Very well, gentlemen, it's time to vote.

1005
01:33:01,843 --> 01:33:04,198
The proponents raise your hands.

1006
01:33:23,804 --> 01:33:27,035
Mr. Carlucci,
Will you cast your vote?

1007
01:33:27,844 --> 01:33:32,395
The government of my country does not intervene
in the affairs of a sovereign state.

1008
01:33:32,564 --> 01:33:33,758
We'll respect your decision.

1009
01:33:52,805 --> 01:33:55,114
This is the message:

1010
01:33:55,325 --> 01:33:59,876
"Ask permission from the jew
in order to receive. "

1011
01:34:09,286 --> 01:34:11,038
You?
- They arrested everyone.

1012
01:35:13,729 --> 01:35:15,924
Where are you taking us?

1013
01:35:38,690 --> 01:35:41,568
Katanga, 17 January 1961

1014
01:36:23,813 --> 01:36:26,122
I hope they do not ...

1015
01:36:59,094 --> 01:37:03,292
Internal bleeding.
Probably showing a perforated stomach.

1016
01:37:03,895 --> 01:37:05,692
Broken ribs.

1017
01:37:06,135 --> 01:37:09,764
If they are not brought in
for an operation,

1018
01:37:10,935 --> 01:37:13,244
it's only a matter of hours.

1019
01:37:20,935 --> 01:37:22,687
I warned you.

1020
01:37:25,136 --> 01:37:26,933
To never set foot in my country.

1021
01:39:50,543 --> 01:39:53,933
Civilians, soldiers,

1022
01:39:54,183 --> 01:39:58,574
on this memorable day,
the anniversary of our independence,

1023
01:39:59,023 --> 01:40:02,572
we greet you with joy and pride.

1024
01:40:03,343 --> 01:40:07,895
On behalf of the Government
we show a minute's silence

1025
01:40:08,184 --> 01:40:12,063
in memory of the man
we cry out as our National Hero:

1026
01:40:12,624 --> 01:40:14,774
Patrice Emery Lumumba.

1027
01:40:32,425 --> 01:40:34,893
You can pray as you wish.

1028
01:40:36,265 --> 01:40:39,177
Nobody knew about that night
in Katanga.

1029
01:40:40,665 --> 01:40:43,702
The children may not know,
do you?

1030
01:40:46,305 --> 01:40:48,262
They wouldn't understand.

1031
01:40:49,506 --> 01:40:53,624
Just tell them that I came
50 years too soon.

1032
01:40:58,906 --> 01:41:02,785
Tell them what we wanted
for our country,

1033
01:41:03,186 --> 01:41:05,336
was not wanted by others.

1034
01:41:30,388 --> 01:41:32,026
Dearest Pauline,

1035
01:41:32,668 --> 01:41:35,978
if you read this, I am dead.

1036
01:41:46,348 --> 01:41:49,421
Tell my children that Congo
has a great future,

1037
01:41:49,589 --> 01:41:52,820
that our dignity is 
there to recover.

1038
01:41:53,909 --> 01:41:56,343
Tell them that during the fight

1039
01:41:56,909 --> 01:41:59,104
I had no time to hesitate

1040
01:41:59,269 --> 01:42:03,740
that the purpose for which we
gave our lives would be overcome.

1041
01:42:04,589 --> 01:42:05,908
Go get him.

1042
01:43:29,873 --> 01:43:31,148
Thanks.

1043
01:44:21,716 --> 01:44:23,866
Weep not for me, my companion.

1044
01:44:24,996 --> 01:44:27,874
History will be the final judge.

1045
01:44:28,716 --> 01:44:31,514
That history will not be
written in Brussels,

1046
01:44:31,676 --> 01:44:33,827
Paris or Washington.

1047
01:44:33,997 --> 01:44:37,990
It will be ours,
the story of a new Africa.

1048
01:44:41,957 --> 01:44:44,517
And on that day ...
