1
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,665
- What does he want?
- I'll find out.

2
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:44,503
You don't have to take orders
from this man, you know.

3
00:00:44,628 --> 00:00:47,005
Well, I'm the liaison officer.
So I'm liaising.

4
00:00:48,465 --> 00:00:50,509
You're sure you know what
you're doing, old man?

5
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:52,761
Yes, and what ever this is,
it's important to him...

6
00:00:52,845 --> 00:00:54,930
that I see it.

7
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,476
- I'll keep an eye on them sir.
- Very good.

8
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:26,670
MERRY CHRISTMAS
MR. LAWRENCE

9
00:03:04,643 --> 00:03:09,231
A disgracefuI incident has occurred.

10
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:12,901
I will deal with it myself.

11
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:17,030
If It's secret why show me?

12
00:03:17,072 --> 00:03:21,201
I want you to witness it.

13
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:24,580
- Know what he did?
- This dutch soldier?

14
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:30,752
Not him he was in a cell for stealing bananas.

15
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:35,007
- The korean guard?
- Of course.

16
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,886
Kanemoto tell this british officer what you did.

17
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:41,305
Kanemoto come on!
Say it!

18
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,059
Say it! You, Kanemoto!

19
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:53,192
Why don't you?
Are you too ashamed?

20
00:03:59,823 --> 00:04:02,826
You know now Lawrence?

21
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:08,582
Last night he stole into the
cell of that dutch boy.

22
00:04:12,336 --> 00:04:15,339
Kanemoto show us how you used
this thing of yours.

23
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:20,427
Show us how you used it on this
white fellow's ass.

24
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:24,264
Just do it for us now!

25
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:30,020
Untie him.

26
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:38,195
Kanemoto! Do it! Hear me? Now!

27
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:44,785
Has your dainty thing become
too shrunken to be potent?

28
00:04:47,412 --> 00:04:52,000
If you can bugger him again
you may comit Harakiri.

29
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,294
Have you gone mad?

30
00:04:56,463 --> 00:05:01,677
You haven't seen a japanese
untiI you've seen Harakiri.

31
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:04,680
I don't want to watch it!

32
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:09,893
Do you want me to hate the japanese?

33
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:12,563
I'll do it!

34
00:05:15,357 --> 00:05:18,694
Stop it! For God's sake,
stop it!

35
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,821
Lawrence, out of the way!

36
00:05:20,904 --> 00:05:24,700
Haven't you shamed him enough?

37
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:29,788
Shame? He didn't even resist being raped!

38
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:32,457
Can you get up?

39
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,920
You're Dutch, aren't you?

40
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:40,966
De Jong, sir.Karel De Jong.

41
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:43,969
Now you'd better
sit down.

42
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:46,763
Now tell me
what happened.

43
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:54,771
In the begin in he camein to
dress this wound of mine.

44
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,274
For three days, every night.

45
00:06:00,986 --> 00:06:04,573
He was, he was very kind.

46
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:11,079
But then last night, he suddenly...

47
00:06:12,039 --> 00:06:15,959
Captain Yonoi! This is
Colonel Lawrence! Come quickly!

48
00:06:27,846 --> 00:06:31,016
Kanemoto, I'll assist you.

49
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,062
Stop it!

50
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,982
Watch this!

51
00:06:39,983 --> 00:06:41,860
Sergeant Hara...

52
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,617
Attention!

53
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:06,260
What's going on?

54
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,471
Sergeant Hara is going execute this man!

55
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:14,017
- This is not your concern.
- Then why bring me here?

56
00:07:14,184 --> 00:07:19,648
- Who ordered this execution?
- This is not an execution.

57
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:24,903
Kanemoto is trying to comit
suicide for his crime.

58
00:07:25,195 --> 00:07:28,907
And you ignore it?

59
00:07:29,658 --> 00:07:31,493
Out of compassion.

60
00:07:32,327 --> 00:07:36,915
His family is poor. If we deem
his death an accident...

61
00:07:37,332 --> 00:07:41,086
they will get a pension.

62
00:07:42,421 --> 00:07:45,048
What crime has he committed?

63
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:47,176
Let me report in private.

64
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:03,942
I've no time now. I'm due at a
military trial in Batavia.

65
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:06,987
Make your report later.

66
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,767
This way, sir.

67
00:08:51,365 --> 00:08:54,660
- Captain Yonoi is here, sir.
- Let him in.

68
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:09,967
I'm Captain Yonoi.
I'm here for the trial.

69
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:15,848
We are very honoured to have
Captain Yonoi here today.

70
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,977
This is Colonel Fujimura,
President of the court.

71
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,899
- Pleased to serve with you.
- Good to have you here.

72
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,570
My name is Iwata.

73
00:09:29,862 --> 00:09:34,032
The military situation here is very serious.

74
00:09:34,157 --> 00:09:37,953
Your service is important.

75
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,503
Gentlemen, the defendant is
a very difficuIt man.

76
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:57,306
All rise to attention!

77
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:30,631
Before the court is the
case of Jack Celliers.

78
00:10:31,715 --> 00:10:35,469
Your name is given
as Jack Celliers.

79
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:37,721
Is that correct?

80
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:42,851
- Why shouldn't it be?
- What do you mean by that?

81
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:49,650
Answer the question!
Is your name Jack Celliers?

82
00:10:49,942 --> 00:10:53,403
I've answered that question
about a hundred times.

83
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:59,785
Read the charges.

84
00:11:02,204 --> 00:11:04,248
The prisioner, Jack Celliers,
a Major in the British army...

85
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,126
parachuted with four men into...

86
00:11:08,377 --> 00:11:13,882
the Banten Valley.

87
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,760
They waged guerilla warfare.

88
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,597
On october 16, they attacked a
japanese transport unit.

89
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:27,312
They took ammunition, killed
PFC Takeshi Tazaki, then...

90
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:32,484
they wounded Corp. Sawafuji
and four others.

91
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:37,739
His crime is covered by
martial law regulations.

92
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:43,620
We recommend a death penalty...

93
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:48,750
as prescribed in section 1

94
00:11:54,339 --> 00:11:57,718
Accordingly, he should receive
the death penalty...

95
00:11:57,885 --> 00:12:03,599
as prescribed in Section 1,
chapter 5 of the regulations.

96
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:09,855
How do you plead?

97
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,359
Not guilty. I'm not a criminal.

98
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:17,863
I am a soldier in His Majesty's army.

99
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:22,367
One month ago I came out of the
Djaja Sempoer mountains.

100
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:26,538
I surrendered to Colonel Utsumi
of the Imperial Japanese Army.

101
00:12:26,663 --> 00:12:31,627
I was imprisioned at Sukabumi.
3 days in solitary confinement.

102
00:12:32,544 --> 00:12:35,422
Then I was questioned
by Lieutenant Ito.

103
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,550
He asked me my name and
rankand I told him.

104
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:43,180
Then Lieutenant Ito asked me:
"Is that true?"

105
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:48,936
I replied:
"of course, it is. I'm with the British army."

106
00:12:49,186 --> 00:12:51,980
Do you mean you would never
give a false name?

107
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:55,400
Let me ask you something.

108
00:12:55,651 --> 00:12:58,362
Why would a man who's about to
die give a false name?

109
00:12:58,612 --> 00:13:02,574
A japanese soldier it caught
would give a false name.

110
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:08,914
A Japanese soldier would never
submit to being caught.

111
00:13:09,164 --> 00:13:11,500
But then, I'm not a japanese.

112
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:16,129
Why did you refuse to tell
about yourself?

113
00:13:16,255 --> 00:13:19,591
You must tell us your pass history.

114
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:21,718
My past is my business.

115
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,647
What was the reason for
giving yourself up?

116
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,440
You've just read it,
haven't you?

117
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:39,653
Your men said they'd kill
the villagers.

118
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:45,742
- How many men did you have?
- None.

119
00:13:46,201 --> 00:13:48,120
- Liar!
- I'm not a liar.

120
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:54,001
I had four men but they
were killed in action.

121
00:13:55,127 --> 00:13:58,672
We know you led a group
of native soldiers.

122
00:13:58,755 --> 00:14:00,841
We are bound to find them
sooner or later.

123
00:14:01,008 --> 00:14:03,177
Why don't you confess your crime?

124
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,680
I've never led natives.

125
00:14:06,763 --> 00:14:09,224
Look, why don't I have a defense counsel?

126
00:14:09,641 --> 00:14:13,061
Exactly what kind of trial
are you giving me?

127
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:15,314
This whole thing's a bloody farce.

128
00:14:17,316 --> 00:14:21,737
Erase all those remarks.

129
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,784
May I question him?

130
00:14:33,332 --> 00:14:38,045
"To be or not to be.
"That is the question,

131
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:44,426
The prosecutor said that you
landed in Java by parachute.

132
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:47,304
Under whose orders?

133
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,390
Under the orders of the
Suprem e Commander of...

134
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:52,351
His Majesty's forces in India.

135
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:55,062
Were you not under the
commander of Java?

136
00:14:55,729 --> 00:14:58,857
You know I came to Java in August.

137
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:02,819
You know the commander in
Java was captured in March.

138
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:06,532
- You know Captain...
- Captain Yonoi.

139
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:12,913
If this man fought in India
as a legitimate soldier.

140
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:18,210
Then we must treat him as
a prisioner of war.

141
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:22,256
- We have no proof.
- I believe this man.

142
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:27,636
What were you asked when captured?

143
00:15:27,845 --> 00:15:30,639
Were you asked how to
intended to conduct a...

144
00:15:30,722 --> 00:15:32,558
guerilla war with only five men?

145
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:37,396
Well, I suspect they thought we
were an advance party...

146
00:15:37,521 --> 00:15:40,315
for a new campaign presumably
the invasion of Java!

147
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:43,318
They wanted to know dates and places.

148
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:45,487
What did you say?

149
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:47,531
I said I thought they were crackers.

150
00:15:47,614 --> 00:15:48,532
What?

151
00:15:48,657 --> 00:15:52,411
- I thought they were mad.
- And then?

152
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:57,958
Then they stopped feeding me,
and started beating me.

153
00:15:59,001 --> 00:16:00,878
Can you prove that you were beaten?

154
00:16:19,438 --> 00:16:21,064
Put on your shirt!

155
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:24,610
No more questions!

156
00:16:41,877 --> 00:16:43,795
The court retires.

157
00:16:59,978 --> 00:17:05,192
A delay this long usually means
a firing squad.

158
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:10,989
But nowadays new officers like
to try out their swords...

159
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:12,991
on white necks.

160
00:17:34,888 --> 00:17:38,267
The verdict in your case
has been postponed.

161
00:17:38,392 --> 00:17:40,269
We shall wait for further instructions.

162
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,661
Stand up.

163
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,980
Good day for it, sir.

164
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:27,816
Yes.

165
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:32,779
You have a family waiting for you,
Corporal?

166
00:18:35,574 --> 00:18:39,620
Wife and two kids, sir.
One with, one without.

167
00:18:43,499 --> 00:18:45,626
How's about yourself, sir?

168
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:10,526
- Tea?
- Yes, I'd like that.

169
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:43,976
The prisoner, sir!

170
00:20:02,286 --> 00:20:05,789
Can you guess
what I'm thinking.

171
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,669
Yes, I think so. Can you?

172
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:46,205
He's rebellious to the end.

173
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:51,001
You have been found
guilty on all charges.

174
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:55,714
The sentence will be carried
out without delay.

175
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:58,759
Make him ready!

176
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:02,888
- I don't need any help.
- Let him alone!

177
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:06,683
I've practiced walking for years.

178
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,401
Firing position!

179
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:28,288
I don't need that.

180
00:21:29,373 --> 00:21:34,837
The blind fold is for the firing squad!

181
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:39,550
So they don't look into
your eyes as you die.

182
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:44,680
Let him be.

183
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:51,645
Prepare to fire!

184
00:21:56,525 --> 00:21:58,026
Firing positions!

185
00:22:03,782 --> 00:22:04,741
Fire!

186
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,751
That's a good one!

187
00:22:28,515 --> 00:22:29,725
Sergeant Hara...

188
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:33,645
Sergeant Hara...

189
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:43,322
Lawrence can't you let me sleep?

190
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:45,157
I'm sorry.

191
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:51,163
I was just now riding on top of
Marlene Dietrich's tummy.

192
00:22:51,246 --> 00:22:53,081
In a hideway in Manchuria!

193
00:22:59,546 --> 00:23:02,049
I must talk to you.

194
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,804
Why's he here?

195
00:23:08,347 --> 00:23:13,227
I want you to protect him.

196
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:14,853
Why?

197
00:23:15,229 --> 00:23:17,731
My men heard about him.

198
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:23,195
- I told you not to talk!
- I didn't.

199
00:23:23,487 --> 00:23:29,576
There were japanese soldiers
and korean guards there.

200
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:32,246
You accuse japanese...?

201
00:23:32,329 --> 00:23:35,958
It was probably the guards.

202
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:39,461
Don't you realize that everyone
is going to know?

203
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:42,047
I understood.

204
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:47,469
Will all your men want to
bugger him now?

205
00:23:47,636 --> 00:23:50,848
Is it true that english men
are all homosexuals?

206
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:52,766
Don't be stupid.

207
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:57,396
Listen I need your help.

208
00:23:58,105 --> 00:24:01,233
A japanese never asks help
from an enemy.

209
00:24:01,942 --> 00:24:05,654
Hey, are you a homosexual?

210
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:11,243
He says you are a homosexual.
Are you?

211
00:24:11,493 --> 00:24:13,245
No sir. I am not.

212
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,247
He's not.

213
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:18,208
You all fear homosexuality!

214
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,170
A samurai doesn't fear it.

215
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:26,842
Wars create friendships amongst men.

216
00:24:27,426 --> 00:24:32,514
That hardly means that all
soldiers become homosexual.

217
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:38,353
You are not soldiers,
you are prisioners!

218
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:45,068
So you lack discipline,
and you beg favours.

219
00:24:45,152 --> 00:24:48,780
- Shame!
- Sergeant Hara...

220
00:24:49,823 --> 00:24:55,329
I've nothing to be ashamed of.

221
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,459
A new prisioner has arrived.

222
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:05,380
Another queer's here!

223
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:15,974
I've brought a prisioner from
military prison, Batavia.

224
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:24,608
I'm sergeant Gengo Hara.
I'll take over.

225
00:25:34,117 --> 00:25:35,953
Your name and rank?

226
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:39,498
Celliers, Jack. Major,
British Army.

227
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:43,126
Celliers? Jack Celliers?
Straffer Jack?

228
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:46,630
Good morning, Colonel.

229
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:54,346
You bastard!

230
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:58,517
Stop it!

231
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:09,486
No! Stop it! Stop it!

232
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:18,537
You! Officer! Do you
know this man?

233
00:26:19,454 --> 00:26:23,000
We served together in Libya.
We fought the Germans.

234
00:26:23,083 --> 00:26:25,210
Take him to the sick bay.

235
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:36,430
What kind of a man is he?

236
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:38,724
Is he a close friend of yours?

237
00:26:39,725 --> 00:26:42,186
No. He's not a close friend, no.

238
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:46,982
- What kind of a soldier is he?
- He's a fine soldier.

239
00:26:48,692 --> 00:26:51,820
We had a nickname for him
in the 8th Army.

240
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:53,739
We called him straffer Jack.

241
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:55,324
Straffer is a kind of um...

242
00:26:57,451 --> 00:27:00,454
it's very difficult to translate.
Straffer is um...

243
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:03,707
This is astonishingly difficult sometimes.

244
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,794
In any case,
he was a soldier's soldier.

245
00:27:09,963 --> 00:27:11,757
Why are you so
interested in him?

246
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:21,558
- What did the doctor say?
- I din't talk to the doctor.

247
00:27:21,642 --> 00:27:23,143
You fool!

248
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:25,729
Lawrecen, I want him in good
health as quickly as possible.

249
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,898
That's an order!

250
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:31,735
You don't have to order me
to look after a sick man.

251
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:35,155
I will send the japanese
medic to see him.

252
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:39,660
Why are you so concerned
about Major Celliers?

253
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:41,703
Send our medic.

254
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:53,549
- The commandig officer, sir.
- Let him in.

255
00:28:01,014 --> 00:28:04,017
You spend more time with these
Japs than you do with...

256
00:28:04,101 --> 00:28:05,060
your own men.

257
00:28:05,143 --> 00:28:09,106
I called Colonel Lawrence here.
Now from you...

258
00:28:09,189 --> 00:28:11,733
I want the names of all
prisoners who are informed...

259
00:28:11,817 --> 00:28:13,735
on the subject of armaments
and ammunition.

260
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:15,654
Who are the experts here?

261
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:19,116
I am not required under
International Law...

262
00:28:19,158 --> 00:28:20,993
to furnish the enemy with
any information.

263
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:24,663
This is not North Africa.
We are not Germans!

264
00:28:24,872 --> 00:28:26,748
There is no Geneva Convention here.

265
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:30,669
If you do not follow my orders,
I will have to replace you.

266
00:28:30,836 --> 00:28:34,506
Replace me?
What are you talking about?

267
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,341
Replace me with whom?

268
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:42,556
Do you know what
he's talking about?

269
00:28:42,764 --> 00:28:43,974
No sir. I don't know.

270
00:28:46,101 --> 00:28:48,604
You promised to improve our food ration.

271
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:50,647
You eat the same as we eat.

272
00:28:50,772 --> 00:28:54,234
Give me the names of your experts.

273
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:59,031
No, Captain Yonoi.
I will not.

274
00:29:13,795 --> 00:29:17,716
Captain Yonoi. Please try to understand.

275
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,928
Group Captain Hicksley
is an honourable man.

276
00:29:22,513 --> 00:29:25,015
"They are all, all honourable men."

277
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:29,645
As commanding officer, I prefer
another honourable man.

278
00:30:21,905 --> 00:30:24,533
Lawrence, this armaments thing.

279
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:28,745
I think we can string it out
for quite sometime, don't you?

280
00:30:28,829 --> 00:30:31,874
I mean, young Tojo will never
notice the difference.

281
00:30:36,211 --> 00:30:39,506
They're not fool, you know,
sir, the japanese.

282
00:30:40,299 --> 00:30:43,468
They know how badly the war's
going for them.

283
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:45,554
A couple months, it could
all be over.

284
00:30:45,721 --> 00:30:48,432
Then why not try and stay alive
for a couple of months?

285
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,184
Sir, I know these people...

286
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:54,354
I wish you'de be guided by my knowledge.

287
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:57,232
I know these people, too.
They're the enemy.

288
00:30:57,316 --> 00:30:59,318
And you're a British soldier.

289
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:04,990
You know they once beat the Russians.

290
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:07,826
Really? What school did you go to?

291
00:31:07,910 --> 00:31:09,495
Winchester.

292
00:31:25,177 --> 00:31:27,095
Who's looking after Major Celliers?

293
00:31:27,304 --> 00:31:30,140
- I am, sir.
- How's he coming along?

294
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:33,352
He's a tough man.
Anyone else would have been dead

295
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:35,354
When will he be up and
about do you think?

296
00:31:35,437 --> 00:31:37,356
Christ, I had to give him a sedative,
so he'll sleep...

297
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:39,691
most of the time. I'd saya
couple of weeks.

298
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,903
- Good. Where's the big chief?
- I'll get him for you.

299
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:45,864
All right you malingerers.
Now hear this!

300
00:31:45,948 --> 00:31:49,284
Colonel Lawrence is going to
stay here for a few nights.

301
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:52,996
- He's one of those, mate!
- Want my boxing gloves?

302
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:43,172
- Where is he?
- Sleeping.

303
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:46,216
Take me.

304
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:13,827
Why was he captured?

305
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:17,039
He wasn't.
He surrendered.

306
00:33:23,045 --> 00:33:28,300
Why does Capt. Yonoi want to
make him commanding officer?

307
00:33:28,550 --> 00:33:32,930
- I don't know.
- Answer me Lawrence...

308
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:37,476
Because he's a born leader.

309
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:43,649
Why are you still alive?

310
00:33:45,526 --> 00:33:48,445
I'd admire you more if
you killed yourself.

311
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:51,240
A good officer like you!

312
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:56,411
How can you stand the shame?

313
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:02,835
We don't call it shame.

314
00:34:05,295 --> 00:34:11,468
Being a prisioner is one of
the fortunes of war.

315
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:15,180
We surely aren't happy being prisoners.

316
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:21,728
We want to escape.
We want to fight you.

317
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:25,899
That's just quibbling.

318
00:34:26,191 --> 00:34:31,947
No! We want to win.
This camp isn't the end.

319
00:34:32,698 --> 00:34:36,952
We won't kill ourselves.
It's the coward's way out.

320
00:34:37,411 --> 00:34:40,581
You're just scared of dying!

321
00:34:40,706 --> 00:34:43,333
Don't wake the patients.

322
00:34:43,792 --> 00:34:49,256
When I was 12,
I visited the shrine in my village.

323
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:52,593
I offered my life to the Emperor.

324
00:34:52,843 --> 00:34:56,847
I have already died for my country.

325
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:03,228
Yes. But you're not dead are you?

326
00:35:14,781 --> 00:35:16,992
It's all right, Jack.
It's Lawrence.

327
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,994
It's all right. You're fine.
It's all right.

328
00:35:19,077 --> 00:35:24,333
Sergeant Hara isn't going to hurt you.

329
00:35:29,254 --> 00:35:32,090
Sergeant Hara isn't going to hurt anyone.

330
00:35:32,132 --> 00:35:33,383
What on earth possessed Yonoi
to save me do you think?

331
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:36,970
I don't know.

332
00:35:41,725 --> 00:35:45,771
What did he say, Lawrence?

333
00:36:29,815 --> 00:36:33,318
What a fynny face!
Beautiful eyes, though.

334
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:23,368
All right?

335
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:28,373
What's that bloody noise!
What's the matter with them?

336
00:37:28,874 --> 00:37:31,168
They're trying to become
super human gods.

337
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:34,046
They live in the past,
these fellows.

338
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:36,882
God help them, Lawrence.

339
00:37:38,634 --> 00:37:41,094
And that's our Captain Yonoi's voice,
isn't it?

340
00:37:41,345 --> 00:37:43,180
He's been screaming
his head off...

341
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,140
ever since you got here.

342
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:47,142
If he's got something
on his mind...

343
00:37:47,226 --> 00:37:49,061
why doesn't he come out with it?

344
00:37:49,144 --> 00:37:51,021
I rather think he is.

345
00:37:51,396 --> 00:37:53,899
Perhaps we're both on the same ladder.

346
00:38:01,949 --> 00:38:03,784
Are you okay?

347
00:38:04,827 --> 00:38:08,163
It was a nightmare.

348
00:39:09,141 --> 00:39:14,855
Ueki is worried about these
training sessions...

349
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:18,692
that they are too violent.

350
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:23,322
Sir, your shouts make the prisioners uneasy.

351
00:39:23,572 --> 00:39:26,700
Lawrence has come to me.

352
00:39:26,742 --> 00:39:29,244
- Lawrence is here?
- Outside.

353
00:39:36,168 --> 00:39:39,838
Is it true that our shouts
disturb the prisoners?

354
00:39:40,422 --> 00:39:42,341
Yes, yes, sir. It is.

355
00:39:43,717 --> 00:39:46,345
And you? Do you feel uneasy?

356
00:39:48,388 --> 00:39:52,851
Well, I find the noise irritating,
but irt doesn't make me uneasy.

357
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:56,438
However, some of the sick men...

358
00:39:57,272 --> 00:40:03,153
- That sick officer, too?
- Major Celliers? Yes.

359
00:40:03,862 --> 00:40:07,282
I do not want the prisoners
to become upset.

360
00:40:08,742 --> 00:40:09,952
Thank you, Captain Yonoi.

361
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:20,796
How wonderful it would have been...

362
00:40:21,046 --> 00:40:23,423
if we could have invited all of you...

363
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,510
to a gathering under our cherry trees.

364
00:40:27,261 --> 00:40:28,554
Yes.

365
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:34,518
My fondest memory of
Japan is the snow.

366
00:40:35,477 --> 00:40:37,354
The trees covered with snow.

367
00:40:40,357 --> 00:40:44,111
- It was snowing on that day.
- What day?

368
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:50,200
Don't you know?
February 26, 1936.

369
00:40:51,243 --> 00:40:53,078
Yes... yes.

370
00:40:54,621 --> 00:40:58,667
I was in Tokyo that day.
You too?

371
00:40:58,917 --> 00:41:04,923
No. I had been sent off to
Manchuria 3 months before.

372
00:41:05,007 --> 00:41:08,135
I was not there
for the uprising.

373
00:41:09,303 --> 00:41:11,180
You regret that?

374
00:41:12,055 --> 00:41:14,892
My comrades were executed.

375
00:41:15,058 --> 00:41:18,687
I was left to die after them.

376
00:41:20,981 --> 00:41:25,861
I see. So you were one of the
shining young officers...

377
00:41:39,875 --> 00:41:42,503
And bring that sick officer Lawrence.

378
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:51,053
Attention.

379
00:41:52,095 --> 00:41:54,181
Salute.

380
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:06,318
Eyes right.

381
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:11,156
Lawrence, where is that sick officer?

382
00:42:11,615 --> 00:42:15,118
- The doctor stopped him.
- You stopped him, Lawrence.

383
00:42:15,410 --> 00:42:16,995
He is very weak.

384
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:21,792
Where is the victim?
Let him step forward.

385
00:42:27,798 --> 00:42:30,133
We're here on your orders.

386
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,680
We're under no obligation to
watch this execution.

387
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,895
If you had any humanity left in you, sir,
you would let us leave.

388
00:42:42,271 --> 00:42:45,065
Any of you who can't watch it...

389
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:46,984
keep your eyes shut or turn round!

390
00:42:47,067 --> 00:42:50,529
But I will no permit you
to leave this site!

391
00:42:50,821 --> 00:42:53,157
Allied officers do not turn
their back on the enemy.

392
00:43:12,176 --> 00:43:13,302
Ready...

393
00:44:07,397 --> 00:44:08,607
Raised your head.

394
00:44:49,565 --> 00:44:50,983
Roll him over.

395
00:44:51,900 --> 00:44:54,194
Christ. He's swallowed part
of his tongue.

396
00:45:06,081 --> 00:45:08,750
- Pay your respects.
- Come on, lads.

397
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,547
- Not yet.
- We want to pay our respects!

398
00:45:13,714 --> 00:45:17,467
- You Jap lover!
- Stop them.

399
00:45:17,634 --> 00:45:22,306
You have no respect for anything!
Not even your own men!

400
00:45:22,431 --> 00:45:25,225
You're wrong, Captain Yonoi!
By God you're wrong.

401
00:45:25,392 --> 00:45:28,270
You are to say nothing
about today's execution...

402
00:45:28,353 --> 00:45:30,189
or this soldier's death
until it is announced.

403
00:45:30,397 --> 00:45:35,152
If you're so bloody right,
you've got nothing to hide!

404
00:45:35,277 --> 00:45:38,989
We must wait for the
official announcement.

405
00:45:39,156 --> 00:45:41,408
This is the right way.
I am right.

406
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:43,952
Colonel Lawrence,
am I not right?

407
00:45:45,621 --> 00:45:49,416
No. No, Captain Yonoi.
You're wrong.

408
00:45:49,708 --> 00:45:52,586
We're all wrong.

409
00:45:57,174 --> 00:46:01,887
I order all prisoners,
each and everyone of you...

410
00:46:02,095 --> 00:46:07,559
not to go out to the fields
today or tomorrow.

411
00:46:07,726 --> 00:46:12,439
Instead, you shall stay inside
your barracks for 48 hours...

412
00:46:12,648 --> 00:46:15,150
and undergo "gyo".

413
00:46:16,109 --> 00:46:21,657
You'll observe gyo for 48 hours.
There will be no eating

414
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,493
or drinking. Is this clear?

415
00:46:30,582 --> 00:46:32,459
What the hell's gyo?

416
00:46:32,751 --> 00:46:35,796
It's a Japanese cure for laziness.

417
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:38,340
Laziness, Jesus Christ!

418
00:46:38,757 --> 00:46:40,801
Why don't you listen?

419
00:46:42,010 --> 00:46:44,137
He means spiritual laziness.
And he believes...

420
00:46:44,179 --> 00:46:46,056
that if he takes away the food
and the water, then he also...

421
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:48,100
takes away the nourishment
for the laziness!

422
00:46:48,225 --> 00:46:50,853
You don't believe that bullshit,
do you?

423
00:46:50,936 --> 00:46:52,020
I don't fucking know!

424
00:46:52,187 --> 00:46:55,190
Sir, I will tell you something that
may surprise you.

425
00:46:55,274 --> 00:46:57,234
If we do it, he'll do it!

426
00:47:29,141 --> 00:47:31,143
- Pheasant!
- Here.

427
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,021
- Mills!
- Here.

428
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:36,940
- Ibbertson
- I'm hungry.

429
00:47:37,941 --> 00:47:40,694
- Adams.
- Eggs and bacon, mate.

430
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,907
- Baxter!
- Steak and kidney-pie.

431
00:47:46,617 --> 00:47:51,330
Put up with it for another 13 or 14 hours.
You can do it!

432
00:47:51,705 --> 00:47:55,000
How about giving us a wee whisky?

433
00:47:56,001 --> 00:47:58,504
What about a double whisky?

434
00:48:00,088 --> 00:48:01,048
De Jong!

435
00:48:02,925 --> 00:48:06,053
Next! Who's next?

436
00:48:06,178 --> 00:48:07,471
He's dead.

437
00:48:10,474 --> 00:48:14,853
He's not dead!
He'll be back in a few days!

438
00:48:14,978 --> 00:48:16,939
De Jong has been killed!

439
00:48:18,273 --> 00:48:23,821
De Jong has been Killed!
De Jong has been Killed!

440
00:48:25,948 --> 00:48:27,115
Thank you.

441
00:48:27,866 --> 00:48:29,326
Next.

442
00:48:29,493 --> 00:48:31,328
- Craig!
- Here.

443
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:34,331
- Smith!
- Yes.

444
00:48:34,581 --> 00:48:35,833
Celliers!

445
00:48:44,967 --> 00:48:47,761
- Where is Major Celliers?
- He said he'd be back soon.

446
00:48:47,928 --> 00:48:50,347
One man is missing.
Major Celliers.

447
00:48:50,472 --> 00:48:52,975
Look, he'll be here in a moment.
Just mark us all here.

448
00:48:53,141 --> 00:48:56,270
I can't do that. I'll have to
report him missing.

449
00:48:56,353 --> 00:48:58,522
No, please.
Just a few minutes!

450
00:49:02,442 --> 00:49:03,652
Celliers?

451
00:49:04,611 --> 00:49:05,863
That's right.

452
00:49:06,530 --> 00:49:08,740
What are those flowers for?

453
00:49:10,117 --> 00:49:11,201
Food.

454
00:49:11,743 --> 00:49:12,786
Food?

455
00:49:15,664 --> 00:49:18,417
I wish they were white, but these
were all that I could find.

456
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:20,377
In memory of De Jong.

457
00:49:21,628 --> 00:49:24,715
It might be nice if you were to
say something Lawrence.

458
00:49:36,685 --> 00:49:39,563
Our father who art in Heaven
Hallowed by thy name

459
00:49:39,646 --> 00:49:43,650
Thy Kingdom come,
Thy will be done

460
00:49:43,734 --> 00:49:46,862
Give us this day
our daily bread

461
00:49:47,654 --> 00:49:53,577
And forgive us our trespasses,
As we forgive them that...

462
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:56,121
- Give me another.
- And lead us not into temp

463
00:50:00,876 --> 00:50:04,296
What are you doing?
We must observe the gyo.

464
00:50:04,379 --> 00:50:06,048
What the hell are you doing, Major?

465
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:10,844
I gave Major Celliers permission, sir.

466
00:50:11,011 --> 00:50:14,806
Ah, changed our tune, have we?
What happened to the gyo?

467
00:50:15,641 --> 00:50:19,144
- What are all these flowers for?
- In memory of De Jong, sir.

468
00:50:19,311 --> 00:50:23,106
He didn't give me permission, sir.
And it was my idea.

469
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:24,733
Really?

470
00:50:25,317 --> 00:50:27,903
Lawrence, over here.

471
00:50:35,661 --> 00:50:40,290
You knew of Yonoi's plan to
replace me as comander?

472
00:50:40,374 --> 00:50:41,875
Yes, sir, I did.

473
00:50:42,084 --> 00:50:44,086
May I ask why
you didn't tell me?

474
00:50:44,336 --> 00:50:46,588
It's still only a rumor, sir.

475
00:50:50,926 --> 00:50:52,803
You don't like me, do you?

476
00:50:53,470 --> 00:50:55,013
Captain Yonoi doesn't like you.

477
00:50:55,848 --> 00:50:57,891
I don't know what to
make of you, Lawrence.

478
00:50:59,434 --> 00:51:03,689
You've either very clever, or
you're bloody stupid.

479
00:51:03,772 --> 00:51:05,357
But I tell you one thing.

480
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:08,110
I will never give Yonoi any
information about officers...

481
00:51:08,402 --> 00:51:12,906
or armaments.
You understand that?

482
00:51:13,740 --> 00:51:16,743
And I will never resign as
commander of this camp.

483
00:51:16,827 --> 00:51:19,204
You can tell that to Yonoi.
Never!

484
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:07,503
Bloody hell!
It's an inspection!

485
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:12,424
Don't waste the food.
Keep eating it.

486
00:52:12,549 --> 00:52:14,468
I'll take the responsibility.
And keep singing.

487
00:52:14,676 --> 00:52:18,931
Rock of Ages,
cleft for me

488
00:52:19,097 --> 00:52:23,101
Let me hide
Myself in Thee

489
00:52:23,936 --> 00:52:27,147
Let the water
And the Blood

490
00:52:27,231 --> 00:52:28,690
Come on now...

491
00:52:28,857 --> 00:52:34,196
From Thy riven side which
Flow'd Be of sin the

492
00:52:34,530 --> 00:52:36,365
For God's sake get those bloody
flowers off De Jong's bed!

493
00:52:39,326 --> 00:52:40,661
No, leave those on.
