You know, I just couldn't wait
to get out of that hell hole,
and--

321
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:38,683
I don't know, now since
I've been back...

322
00:28:38,716 --> 00:28:43,455
I don't even know what to do
with myself half the time. So...

323
00:28:44,321 --> 00:28:48,727
I know. Me, too.

Hey.

326

This must be Paul.

327
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,835
You see that bed over there?

That's yours if you
want to keep sleeping.

329

You're gonna have fun.
You're gonna make some new
friends, okay?

330

I don't want to go, Maggie.

Hey, we're gonna do something
special for dinner tonight,
okay?

332

Okay.

At ease.

on your Bronze Star.

You are a glutton
for punishment.

You want some tea?
My wife's got me drinking tea.

347

No, thank you, sir.

348
00:30:45,342 --> 00:30:48,446
So how does it feel?

349

Be back second time around?

350

It's always an adjustment, sir.

351
00:30:52,716 --> 00:30:58,356
I always say, coming home is a
lot harder than going to war.

352
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:00,157
So many damn expectations.

353
00:31:00,190 --> 00:31:02,727
Yes, sir.

354
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:06,297
So, what's the deal?
You married, you got kids?

355
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,399
I have a son, he's 5. 

356
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:15,907
Oh, man, that's a great age.
I have a couple of little
ones myself.

357
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,842
How old are they, sir?

358
00:31:17,875 --> 00:31:22,013
Oh, the photos
are a little out of date.

359

It's amazing how fast
they grow, huh?

360
00:31:24,248 --> 00:31:25,816
It is.

361
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:28,986
So, I take it you know why
you've been assigned here.

362
00:31:29,019 --> 00:31:33,658
Yes, sir. I'm sorry about
Sergeant Stevens, I heard
about the accident.

Find the justice in that.

Now here's the deal.

366
00:31:45,102 --> 00:31:48,306
We are in the pipeline
to ship out in nine months...

367
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:53,611
and I've got an ambulance
platoon walking around like
a chicken without a head.

368
00:31:53,644 --> 00:32:00,418
I'm making you Platoon Sergeant,
until I find a suitable
replacement. You up for it?

369
00:32:00,451 --> 00:32:02,586
Yes, sir.

370
00:32:02,619 --> 00:32:05,556
You got your work
cut out for you.

371
00:32:05,589 --> 00:32:07,858
Moral is in the shitter.

372
00:32:07,891 --> 00:32:13,230
I put in a request with brigade
for a permanent fill, but until
then, you are in charge.

373
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:16,500
Best guess, you'll be here
three months, maybe six.

374
00:32:16,533 --> 00:32:19,337
Don't suppose you're in a hurry
to deploy anytime soon?

375
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:22,940
No, sir.
I can't say that I am.

First Sergeant Killens will
be back to show you around.

of these kids don't have a clue.

A word of advice. Act like
you're here to stay.

Where are your 02 tanks?

387

I got them right there, Sarn't.

388

I got my camelback, Sarn't.

390
00:32:59,309 --> 00:33:02,646
You got a heat casualty
with a core temp of 112...

391
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:05,683
and you wanna cool him down
with your canteen?

392
00:33:05,716 --> 00:33:07,451
How you think that's gonna
work out for you?

393

Not good, Sarn't! You want me
to grab the water jugs on it?

394

Meet your new Platoon Sergeant,
Sergeant Swann.

Second time over.

Sergeant, these are your squad
leaders, Sergeant Morrison.

400
00:33:32,376 --> 00:33:33,377
How are you doing, Sergeant?

401
00:33:33,410 --> 00:33:35,079
Nice to meet you.

402

Nice to meet you.

406
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:46,891
I trust you'll make her
feel welcome.

407
00:33:46,924 --> 00:33:47,959
Hoowah.

408
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:53,297

Alma usually makes
the yellow rice.

411
00:34:08,145 --> 00:34:10,014
Okay.

412
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,755
Eat.

413
00:34:17,788 --> 00:34:20,491
It's too crunchy.

414
00:34:20,524 --> 00:34:22,860
Alma doesn't make it crunchy.

415
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:25,429
You know, I really don't
care how Alma makes it.

416
00:34:25,462 --> 00:34:27,298
This is how I make it. Okay?

417
00:34:29,299 --> 00:34:30,835
I don't like it.

418
00:34:32,836 --> 00:34:36,774
Just take the skin off, huh?
See? There.

419
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:51,889
Can you just eat properly,
please?

420
00:34:55,392 --> 00:34:56,594

you eat it.

want, you little shit.

It'll be the alternator.

Yeah, why is that?

out. So what, I need a new

802
01:03:45,587 --> 01:03:48,891
But if a woman leaves her
family to go to work,
she's a bad mother.

803
01:03:48,924 --> 01:03:51,193
No, we're not talking about
a three-day business trip here.

804
01:03:51,226 --> 01:03:52,995
You know what? Who's gonna
get us health insurance?

805
01:03:53,028 --> 01:03:55,531
Health insurance?
We would buy health insurance.

806
01:03:55,564 --> 01:04:00,002
With what? Your commissions
from those bullshit condos
that nobody wants?

807
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:04,673
We should have talked
about this.

808
01:04:04,706 --> 01:04:06,742
Oh, really?

809
01:04:04,706 --> 01:04:06,742
Yeah.

810
01:04:06,775 --> 01:04:08,844
Oh, so you're the only one
who gets to do whatever
the fuck you want.

811
01:04:08,877 --> 01:04:11,080
No, this isn't about me,
this has consequences for Paul.

812
01:04:11,113 --> 01:04:13,082
Oh, really, consequences?

813
01:04:13,115 --> 01:04:15,150
So you fucking some big-titted
bimbo you met in a bar didn't
have consequences?

814
01:04:15,183 --> 01:04:18,654
Hey! Don't talk
about Alma like that!

815
01:04:23,725 --> 01:04:25,828
RICHARD (O.S.)
You didn't even try
to get out of it, did you?

816
01:04:25,861 --> 01:04:28,097
Oh, you know that's
not how it works.

817
01:04:39,608 --> 01:04:42,544
So what? So Afghanistan?
For how long?

818
01:04:42,577 --> 01:04:45,014
Nine months... maybe a year.

819
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:47,917
Could be 15 months.

820
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:49,218
It could be.

821
01:04:49,251 --> 01:04:51,086
So why aren't you
more upset about this?

822
01:04:51,119 --> 01:04:52,655
I am upset about this! 

823
01:04:52,688 --> 01:04:54,757
No, no, you just don't
feel anything anymore?

824
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:56,425
The Army takes that
away from you?

825
01:04:56,458 --> 01:04:58,594
Oh, you don't even know what
the fuck you're talking about.

826
01:04:58,627 --> 01:05:00,696
You know what? I look at you
and I look at the woman
that I met six years ago.

827
01:05:00,729 --> 01:05:02,865
I don't even see the
goddamn resemblance.

828
01:05:02,898 --> 01:05:06,068
You don't give a shit about
anybody but yourself, do you?

829
01:05:02,898 --> 01:05:06,068
That is not true!

830
01:05:06,101 --> 01:05:08,570
Huh? Well, why don't you
give me something then, huh?

831
01:05:08,603 --> 01:05:11,640
Why don't you give me a little
taste of how you feel coming
back after 15 months...

832
01:05:11,673 --> 01:05:13,242
and then you get
to leave Paul again.

833
01:05:13,275 --> 01:05:15,644
It sucks!

834
01:05:13,275 --> 01:05:15,644
Because I'll tell you
how I feel about it.

835
01:05:15,677 --> 01:05:18,981
I want to put my head
through a fucking wall!

836
01:05:21,616 --> 01:05:23,385
You think I don't know
what it's like?

837
01:05:23,418 --> 01:05:25,988
Let me tell you something.
You don't know what it's like.

838
01:05:26,021 --> 01:05:29,525
You don't know what it's like
when there's a voice on the
phone and I don't recognize her.

839
01:05:29,558 --> 01:05:33,829
Somebody rings a doorbell,
and I think, hm...

840
01:05:35,497 --> 01:05:39,034
I wonder
if it's dress uniforms.

841
01:05:39,067 --> 01:05:41,670
Wonder how I'm gonna tell Paul.

842
01:05:41,703 --> 01:05:43,605
I'm sorry.

843
01:05:43,638 --> 01:05:46,208
No, you're not, you're
just trying to break
that little boy's heart.

844
01:05:46,241 --> 01:05:49,812
Because you'll fight for your
country, but you won't fight
for your son, will you?

845
01:05:49,845 --> 01:05:51,246
I don't have a choice.

846
01:05:51,279 --> 01:05:54,249
Bullshit. You had a choice,
and you made it.

847
01:05:54,282 --> 01:06:00,489
And I'll tell you something,
if he comes to live with us,
he's gonna stay with us.

848
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:04,126
You wouldn't do that.

849
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:09,031
Well, you made your choice,
so I'll make mine.

850
01:06:20,642 --> 01:06:24,313
Can you play with me?

851
01:06:24,346 --> 01:06:27,049
Do you see I'm in the
middle of something?

852
01:06:32,454 --> 01:06:33,522
It's bleeding.

853
01:06:33,555 --> 01:06:35,357
Yeah, I'm fine.

854
01:06:35,390 --> 01:06:37,893
Can I put a Band-Aid on it?

855
01:06:40,695 --> 01:06:43,032
How come you don't cry? 

856
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:49,571
Alice cut her finger
at Day Care and she cried
for like three hours.

857
01:06:49,604 --> 01:06:52,441
I used to cry when I was little.

858
01:06:52,474 --> 01:06:56,979
I guess the older you get,
you just do it less and less.

859
01:06:57,012 --> 01:06:59,949
I guess it's just a part
of being a grown-up.

860
01:07:16,164 --> 01:07:19,735
 ( SOFT MUSIC PLAYING )

861
01:07:19,768 --> 01:07:24,473
All right, man, looks good.
Congratulations.

862
01:07:24,506 --> 01:07:28,944
See you at the movie all right?
Hey, save me a seat this time.

863
01:07:28,977 --> 01:07:30,279
All right, I'm gonna head out.

864
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:32,181
This good?

865
01:07:32,214 --> 01:07:33,782
Yeah, it's great, it's all done.

866
01:07:33,815 --> 01:07:37,653
Hang on. Stick around.
Talk to me.

867
01:07:42,257 --> 01:07:44,359
How you doing?

868
01:07:44,392 --> 01:07:46,328
Can't complain.

869
01:07:46,361 --> 01:07:48,430
Can't or won't.

870
01:07:48,463 --> 01:07:49,798
You miss your kid?

871
01:07:49,831 --> 01:07:54,570
Oh, god, every day.
Are you trying to make me cry?

872
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,238
No.

873
01:07:54,603 --> 01:07:56,238
It won't work.

874
01:07:56,271 --> 01:08:02,845
Can't deal with tears.
You can talk to me, though.

875
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:05,314
You know that, right?

876
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:05,314
Yeah, I know that.

877
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:07,483
Because we're all
we got out here.

878
01:08:07,516 --> 01:08:09,351
That's right.

879
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:16,692
You make me feel good, Maggie.

880
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:18,694
You always have.

881
01:08:20,629 --> 01:08:24,233
The truth is... you excite me.

882
01:08:26,034 --> 01:08:31,874
Relax. Nobody's coming in.

883
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:37,312
Mark, we're friends, okay?
You're married.

884
01:08:37,345 --> 01:08:42,351
We're more than friends,
and you know it.

885
01:08:49,057 --> 01:08:53,195
Listen, I've been on the
other side, it's not--

886
01:08:49,057 --> 01:08:53,195
Ssh...

887
01:09:01,603 --> 01:09:03,205
No, that's enough. No.

888
01:09:04,706 --> 01:09:05,941
No, we cannot.

889
01:09:05,974 --> 01:09:07,176
I want you so bad.

890
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:09,678
No. Look, hey!

891
01:09:09,711 --> 01:09:11,480
I think about you all the time.

892
01:09:11,513 --> 01:09:14,783
That's enough. Stop, stop.

893
01:09:14,816 --> 01:09:18,187
Please stop.
Mark, I mean it, up!

894
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,923
Come on, get off!

895
01:09:20,956 --> 01:09:22,257
You know you want this, Maggie.

896
01:09:22,290 --> 01:09:24,760
Stop it! Get off me!
Get off! Don't do this!

897
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:27,696
I'm gonna make you come so hard
you'll be begging me for more...

898
01:09:27,729 --> 01:09:31,033
Don't do this.
Let go!

899
01:09:34,803 --> 01:09:37,306
How the fuck?

900
01:09:37,339 --> 01:09:41,677
Ow! Fuck!
Jesus Christ, Maggie!

901
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:51,520
What are you doing?

902
01:09:51,553 --> 01:09:53,355
I will fucking shoot you.

903
01:09:55,190 --> 01:09:59,661
Come on, Swann, we were just
messing around, right?

904
01:09:59,694 --> 01:10:02,064
No, not me.

905
01:10:06,234 --> 01:10:11,873
All right, I fucked up, okay?
I lost my head for a second.

906
01:10:11,906 --> 01:10:13,943
I'm sorry.

907
01:10:19,381 --> 01:10:27,056
Come on, Maggie, let's not
leave it like this, huh?

908
01:10:44,606 --> 01:10:46,074
What are you doing?

909
01:10:46,107 --> 01:10:49,544
What does it look like?

910
01:10:49,577 --> 01:10:52,614
Are you okay?

911
01:10:52,647 --> 01:10:55,550
Yeah, I'm okay.

912
01:10:55,583 --> 01:10:58,820
You'll feel better if you
talk about it, you know?

913
01:10:58,853 --> 01:11:01,757
No, no, I don't know that.

914
01:11:03,758 --> 01:11:08,563
Is it about going back there?

915
01:11:08,596 --> 01:11:11,700
Did something happen?

916
01:11:11,733 --> 01:11:13,936
A lot of things happened.

917
01:11:16,404 --> 01:11:22,210
Why is it so hard for you to let
your guard down for a second?
Why? You think--

918
01:11:22,243 --> 01:11:26,882
Look, I really appreciate
you trying, but do me a favor.

919
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:29,918
I don't ask you about your shit.

920
01:11:33,288 --> 01:11:37,960
Perfect. Perfect.

921
01:11:48,570 --> 01:11:49,571
Sergeant.

922
01:11:49,604 --> 01:11:51,573
Yes.

923
01:11:51,606 --> 01:11:55,444
A few of us are heading out
to celebrate my promotion,
care to join us?

924
01:11:55,477 --> 01:12:00,382
I wish I could, but I've got
some load planning to do.

925
01:12:00,415 --> 01:12:03,852
To tell you the truth,
I wish we could just fast
forward the next four weeks.

926
01:12:03,885 --> 01:12:05,787
I feel like a kid
waiting for Christmas.

927
01:12:05,820 --> 01:12:07,489
Don't tell your wife that.

928
01:12:07,522 --> 01:12:12,260
Well, you know what they say,
first wife is for
practice anyway.

929
01:12:12,293 --> 01:12:16,798
Hey, um, congratulations.

930
01:12:16,831 --> 01:12:18,133
Thanks.

931
01:12:31,713 --> 01:12:34,049
MALCOLM (O.S.)
Maybe I could get you
a reassignment.

932
01:12:34,082 --> 01:12:38,220
We just got a two-year
tour to Korea. Super kush.

933
01:12:38,253 --> 01:12:40,188
I could put in a word
with the CO?

934
01:12:40,221 --> 01:12:41,523
Oh, god, are you crazy?

935
01:12:41,556 --> 01:12:44,893
Like I'm gonna leave
my kid for two years.

936
01:12:44,926 --> 01:12:46,428
You tell him yet?

937
01:12:47,695 --> 01:12:50,932
I feel like an asshole.

938
01:12:50,965 --> 01:12:52,501
Orders are orders.

939
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:57,072
I know... fuck.

940
01:12:57,105 --> 01:13:01,510
I feel like I should be pissed,
and I am, I'm really fucking
pissed.

941
01:13:07,081 --> 01:13:10,185
But you know,
part of me actually...

942
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:19,661
It's really fucked up.

943
01:13:22,330 --> 01:13:25,200
All I know is you're
one hell of a medic.

944
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:34,543
Now the trick is to get it right
in the vein, just like that...

945
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:39,581
because that's where the
medicine needs to go.

946
01:13:39,614 --> 01:13:44,119
and then we put a piece of tape
over it, so it doesn't move.

947
01:13:48,056 --> 01:13:53,395
Nice and easy,
hold on... okay.

948
01:13:55,430 --> 01:13:57,265
Good job. Okay?

949
01:13:57,298 --> 01:14:02,237
Now we're gonna let the patient
rest, because we're gonna talk
about something.

950
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:04,473
Does that mean no bedtime story?

951
01:14:04,506 --> 01:14:08,977
No, no, we can have a bedtime
story, but just pop up here
for a sec, okay? Come on.

952
01:14:12,647 --> 01:14:14,450
Okay.

953
01:14:17,685 --> 01:14:22,090
Remember how I had to go away?
For a while because of work?

954
01:14:22,123 --> 01:14:23,692
To Afghanistan?

955
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:25,227
