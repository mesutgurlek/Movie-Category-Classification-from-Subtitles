# On the tree ##

154
00:11:25,144 --> 00:11:29,240
A lot of very touching songs
came out of that war.

155
00:11:32,084 --> 00:11:36,521
#When the fuhrer says
we is the master race #

#We <i>heil,</i> phtt, <i>heil</i> #

# Right in the fuhrer's face ##

158
00:11:43,395 --> 00:11:45,329
Oh, right.

159
00:11:45,397 --> 00:11:47,331
I guess you want to
send that telegram now.

160
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,663
My very thought, Mercury.
Not a minute to lose.

161
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:57,075
- Okay, shoot.
- To Harry S. Truman, the White House.

162
00:11:57,142 --> 00:12:00,475
And copy the Secretary General
of the United Nations.

163

Uh, uh, Dear Harry,

164
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:08,153
Who's responsible?

165
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:12,316
Sign that: Affectionately,
a dissatisfied customer.

166
00:12:13,692 --> 00:12:16,525
Wow.

167
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:18,790
- Come on! Let's go, send it!
- All right.

168
00:12:18,864 --> 00:12:21,697
Let me know the minute
you get an answer.

170
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:31,639
Hey, Doc. How they honkin'?

171
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:35,271
I've been looking for you.
Don't go up in your helicopter anymore.

172
00:12:36,982 --> 00:12:39,780
- It's not your fault.
- Huh?

173
00:12:39,852 --> 00:12:43,788
You just don't understand
the relationship, probably.

174
00:12:43,856 --> 00:12:47,451
When you go up in the air,
all your stretchers are empty, right?

175
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:50,654
- Sure.
- Yeah, but see, when you come back,

176
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,995
there's always a kid, or a portion
of him in one of the stretchers, right?

177
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:57,058
Well, I can't let you do that anymore.

178
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:03,839
Nobody goes up, nobody gets hurt.

179
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:06,377
That's very interesting, Doc.

180
00:13:06,445 --> 00:13:08,845
Okay, sure, Doc.

181
00:13:08,914 --> 00:13:13,578
You won't be out of a job.
We can turn your chopper into a...

182
00:13:13,652 --> 00:13:17,452
flying saloon or
a house of ill repute in the sky.

183
00:13:18,557 --> 00:13:20,923
Okay, that's done. Now I can...

184
00:13:20,993 --> 00:13:23,325
- get some sleep.

I need a 50cc syringe with a 15 needle.

186
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,481
Get him inside right away.
He's got a tension pneumothorax.

187
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:52,353
We get the air out of his chest,
we can save the lung.

190
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:05,423
Listen, Pierce.

191
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:08,426
You were ordered to stand down.

192
00:14:08,494 --> 00:14:10,724
I did, but I fell up again.

193
00:14:12,097 --> 00:14:16,534
Oh, let me see.
Uh, the Lone Ranger. Very good.

194
00:14:19,638 --> 00:14:24,007
You've gone against orders, Pierce.
Somebody else could have operated.

195
00:14:24,076 --> 00:14:27,978
I asked the kid to sit in the waiting
room, but he's read all our magazines.

196
00:14:28,047 --> 00:14:31,175
I'm gonna be frank with you, Pierce.

197
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,481
- You're gonna be frank with me?
- I mean blunt.

198
00:14:34,553 --> 00:14:37,454
Oh, that's good. Otherwise,
Frank would try to be Henry with me.

199
00:14:37,523 --> 00:14:39,457
I don't think I could stand that.

200
00:14:39,525 --> 00:14:43,621
Now you pay close attention.
Can you understand what I'm saying?

201
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:45,789
Why? Is there something
wrong with your mouth?

202
00:14:45,864 --> 00:14:48,128
No, I'm fine.

203
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:52,296
The problem is you've been
on 24-hour call three nights this week.

204
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:55,397
Three times twenty-four.

205

Look, Doctor. No matter what comes in,
I'm putting you to bed.

206

You're the second person
to make me that offer.

207
00:15:04,683 --> 00:15:07,345
I must be obvious or something.

208
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:11,651
Sorry, Henry. I have to disappoint you.
I just gotta get some sleep.

209
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:14,021
A message from General Clayton, sir.

210
00:15:14,093 --> 00:15:17,028
He's madder than hell, and he's comin'
down here to find out who did it.

211
00:15:17,096 --> 00:15:19,826
- Well, you can hardly blame him.
- Yes, sir.

212
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:26,302
Coming down here
to find out who did what?

213
00:15:26,372 --> 00:15:29,034
Someone sent a telegram
to President Truman, sir.

214
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:32,100
A telegram?
To President Harry S. Truman?

215
00:15:32,177 --> 00:15:34,873
- That president?
- Yes, sir, that's the one.

216
00:15:34,947 --> 00:15:37,745
- Was it dirty?
- Oh, no, sir.

217
00:15:37,816 --> 00:15:40,717
All it... It just said,
"Who's responsible?"

218
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:44,085
Oh. For what?

219
00:15:44,156 --> 00:15:46,556
I don't know, sir. That's what
the general wants to find out.

220
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,559
Well, then he'd better
get down here right away.

221
00:15:48,627 --> 00:15:50,595
- Yes, sir, and he's on his way.
- Good thinkin'.

222
00:15:50,662 --> 00:15:52,653
- Thank you, sir.
- Oh.

223
00:15:52,731 --> 00:15:55,495
Better get that garter belt
and that other stuff out of my tent.

224
00:15:55,567 --> 00:15:58,195
- Yes, sir.
- <i>Oh, and, uh,</i>

225
00:15:58,270 --> 00:16:00,670
do we have enough sherry
and ginger ale for the general?

226
00:16:00,739 --> 00:16:03,333
- Oh, nobody does, sir.
- Well, fine.

227
00:16:03,409 --> 00:16:07,778
Then, if nobody does, we don't have to.
But make sure we do, in case we don't.

228
00:16:13,085 --> 00:16:15,019
Don't you believe in knocking?

229
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:18,022
No. If I can't say something nice
about somebody...

230
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:20,752
- What do you want?
- Sorry to bother you, Major.

231
00:16:20,826 --> 00:16:23,659
There's something of major importance
I have to discuss with the major.

232
00:16:25,631 --> 00:16:28,566
- Where's Frank?
- You mean Major Burns?

233
00:16:30,202 --> 00:16:32,568
You sure he's not in here sniffing
your dress shields or something?

234
00:16:36,775 --> 00:16:38,709
Major Burns is in the mess tent.

235
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:42,770
You know he gives an orientation lecture
every Friday afternoon.

236
00:16:42,848 --> 00:16:47,148
Why, then, are we here?
A very good question.

237
00:16:47,219 --> 00:16:50,711
Let me try to answer
that question with an answer.

238
00:16:50,789 --> 00:16:53,519
The American presence
is present in Korea...

239
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:56,026
<i>at the request of the United Nations.</i>

240
00:16:56,094 --> 00:16:59,029
<i>We're here to keep the peace,</i>

241
00:16:59,097 --> 00:17:02,260
<i>to keep the enemy back behind</i>
<i>the 38th parallel where they came from,</i>

242
00:17:02,334 --> 00:17:06,168
<i>or else, they'll spread south,</i>
<i>down Korea,</i>

243
00:17:06,238 --> 00:17:08,365
turn left, and the next thing we know,

244
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,807
they'll be marching down
Main Street, U.S.A.

245
00:17:13,712 --> 00:17:16,772
There's a great deal I could tell you
about this, men, but, uh,

246
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:21,411
the essence of good teaching is to
answer questions uppermost in your mind.

247
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:26,151
<i>Now, just ask anything at all.</i>

248
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:30,525
Whatever is most uppermost
in your minds. Anyone?

249
00:17:31,763 --> 00:17:33,287
Anyone at all.

250
00:17:33,365 --> 00:17:35,629
<i>Anyone who has a question</i>
<i>on the topic at hand?</i>

251
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:42,166
Any of the enlisted men who is required
to be here that has a question.

252
00:17:42,241 --> 00:17:44,471
Aw, come on, Frank.
I got a question.

253
00:17:45,978 --> 00:17:49,209
- Captain Pierce!
- Why are we here?

254
00:17:50,616 --> 00:17:54,017
I believe I just explained that,
Captain.

255
00:17:54,086 --> 00:17:58,648
No, I mean, what...
what's the war about?

256
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:03,889
Why... What did...
How did it start?

257
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:05,953
The Communists, Pierce.

258
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:08,864
And don't try to make fun of this.
This is serious business.

259
00:18:08,934 --> 00:18:12,097
I'm not making fun, Frank.
I'm trying to figure this out. What...

260
00:18:13,338 --> 00:18:16,136
Why should North Korea
wanna take over America?

261
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,802
Is it something we said?
Something we didn't say?

262
00:18:18,877 --> 00:18:21,368
<i>Let me tell you something, Pierce.</i>

263
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:24,415
These godless Communists have run their
own countries right into the ground,

264
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:27,748
while we've been building the highest
standard of living in the world.

265
00:18:27,819 --> 00:18:30,219
Half of these people over here
never even saw a bathroom.

266
00:18:30,289 --> 00:18:32,416
And believe you me, they want one.

267
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:35,654
- They do?
- You bet your life they do.

268
00:18:35,727 --> 00:18:39,493
And if they can't get our bathrooms
by subversion, they'll get them by war!

269
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:42,159
They can have mine.

270
00:18:42,234 --> 00:18:44,930
I'd be glad to keep my legs crossed
until after the war.

271
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:49,538
That was just a figure of speech.

272
00:18:55,914 --> 00:18:57,848
I can't take your picture now, Radar.

273
00:18:57,916 --> 00:19:00,851
Come back later
and we'll get a pony and do it right.

274
00:19:00,919 --> 00:19:04,252
Uh, I've been looking
all over for you.

275
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:07,719
You can even ride the pony
when we're finished.

276
00:19:08,894 --> 00:19:11,192
Stick around.
I do beautiful work.

277
00:19:20,572 --> 00:19:23,439
I like that. It sells.

278
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:28,874
Pierce, I want you to know
you ruined my lecture!

279
00:19:28,947 --> 00:19:31,438
It was a disgraceful thing to do.

280
00:19:33,952 --> 00:19:35,920
You're taking a picture of a latrine?

281
00:19:37,089 --> 00:19:39,956
Very observant, Frank.
What am I doing now?

282
00:19:40,025 --> 00:19:43,927
- What are you doing?
- Still taking a picture of a latrine.

283
00:19:43,996 --> 00:19:46,760
It was a trick question.

284
00:19:46,832 --> 00:19:50,632
- He's absolutely blabbering.
- Psst.

285
00:19:53,038 --> 00:19:57,441
May one ask why you are taking
a picture of a latrine?

286
00:19:57,509 --> 00:20:00,501
Why is North Korea shooting at us?

287
00:20:01,878 --> 00:20:03,743
What do we have that
they could possibly want?

288
00:20:03,813 --> 00:20:07,180
We have guns, they have guns.
We have tanks, they have tanks.

289
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:12,543
You gave me the clue, Frank.

290
00:20:12,622 --> 00:20:16,558
This war will go down in history
as the Battle of the Bathroom.

291
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:19,186
He's joking.

292
00:20:24,033 --> 00:20:26,797
I'm sending these pictures
to the North with an offer...

293
00:20:26,869 --> 00:20:29,804
and my personal word
that we'll stop if they'll stop.

294
00:20:31,007 --> 00:20:33,805
- Somebody oughta put him to bed.
- You too?

295
00:20:33,876 --> 00:20:37,903
What is this strange power I have that
makes people want to get me to bed?

296
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,312
Pierce, return to your tent
and get some sleep.

297
00:20:42,351 --> 00:20:44,410
That was a direct order
I gave you, Pierce.

298
00:20:48,824 --> 00:20:51,657
Well, he was close.
He's out on my feet.

299
00:20:57,767 --> 00:21:00,793
We gotta do something
about Hawkeye, Henry.

300
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:03,498
He's acting more and more
like a... like a noodle.

301
00:21:03,573 --> 00:21:06,201
I have my own rear end to worry about.

302
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:08,402
General Clayton's due here any minute.

303
00:21:08,477 --> 00:21:12,345
Some dodo's been sending telegrams
to the president from this camp.

304
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,812
Uh, sir, I can identify the dodo.

305
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:22,386
- It was Captain Pierce.
- How do you know?

306
00:21:22,458 --> 00:21:26,758
- Uh, I sent it.
- Why didn't you tell me?

307
00:21:26,829 --> 00:21:29,627
I was only trying to help.
I didn't want him to get into trouble.

308
00:21:29,699 --> 00:21:31,894
Oh, you don't care about me
getting in trouble.

309
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:33,902
You don't need any help.

310
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:36,404
While we're on the subject
of trouble, Henry,

311
00:21:36,472 --> 00:21:38,406
I think you should know
Hawkeye is planning...

312
00:21:38,474 --> 00:21:41,443
to send the officers' latrine
to North Korea.

313
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,035
- Well, that's very friendly.
- Friendly, sir?

314
00:21:44,113 --> 00:21:46,047
Yeah, it's a nice gesture.

315
00:21:46,115 --> 00:21:49,607
But if we send them our latrine,
what are we gonna do for one?

316
00:21:49,685 --> 00:21:53,917
You can carry friendship,
not to mention latrines, a bit far.

317
00:21:53,990 --> 00:21:55,924
What about the general, sir?

318
00:21:55,992 --> 00:22:00,053
He must have his own latrine.
A one-star general, surely he's got...

319
00:22:00,129 --> 00:22:02,120
Henry, Hawkeye's gotta be sedated.

320
00:22:02,198 --> 00:22:05,998
Well, then put him away.
Bomb him!

321
00:22:06,068 --> 00:22:08,662
You guys are really gonna help me?

322
00:22:08,738 --> 00:22:11,673
- Oh, sure.
- Yeah, we want the war over too, Hawk.

323
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,205
Let others sit idly by, huh?

324
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,646
As my grandfather Sparky Pierce
used to say,

325
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:22,980
<i>"There are some who do,</i>
<i>and some who don't. "</i>

326
00:22:23,052 --> 00:22:26,818
He was doing six months in the
New Hampshire License Plate Academy...

327
00:22:26,889 --> 00:22:28,823
when he said it.

328
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:31,121
Oh, 3:00 was a very good hour.

329
00:22:31,193 --> 00:22:34,219
- Should we drink to your plan?
- To peace.

330
00:22:36,098 --> 00:22:38,089
To peace and the American way
of plumbing.

331
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:47,842
[Burps]

332
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,946
Gentlemen,

333
00:22:53,015 --> 00:22:56,109
it's time to bring tranquility
to this troubled peninsula.

334
00:23:08,831 --> 00:23:12,358
- When's he gonna fall down?
- I don't know.

335
00:23:12,435 --> 00:23:15,700
Rasputin swallowed a whole drugstore
and didn't even belch.

336
00:23:30,086 --> 00:23:32,418
Now wait right here, son.
I'll only be a minute.

337
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:37,391
Ooh! Ah! Ooh! Ah!
Uh, sir? Sir!

338
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:41,362
- Sir, don't go in there, General.
- Out of my way, soldier.

339
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:43,364
Or I'll have you court-martialed...

340
00:23:43,432 --> 00:23:45,491
for interfering with
an officer's bodily functions.

341
00:23:45,568 --> 00:23:48,662
Uh... Uh... Uh...

342
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:54,773
Hawkeye! Don't! Don't! Uh...

343
00:23:55,845 --> 00:23:58,313
- Hawkeye, don't!
- [Engine Starts]

344
00:24:06,922 --> 00:24:10,688
<i>Sergeant! Get me outta here!</i>

345
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,423
<i>Do you know who I am?</i>
<i>Let me outta here!</i>

346
00:24:14,497 --> 00:24:17,022
<i>Wait a minute!</i>

347
00:24:17,099 --> 00:24:19,124
<i>Where are we going?</i>

348
00:24:25,207 --> 00:24:28,472
<i>Sergeant! Sergeant!</i>

349
00:24:33,716 --> 00:24:38,346
<i>Well, he drove about 500 yards, then</i>
<i>the stuff hit him and he lost altitude.</i>

350
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:40,354
That's your cuckoo stunts.

351
00:24:40,422 --> 00:24:42,720
- Four on the five.
- <i>Oh, yeah.</i>

352
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:46,694
Taking a general for a ride
to North Korea in a latrine.

353
00:24:46,762 --> 00:24:50,630
<i>[Pierce Mumbling]</i>

354
00:24:50,699 --> 00:24:53,327
<i>Mclntyre,</i>
<i>what makes him do these things?</i>

355
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:57,270
He's just unstable. He took
this weird oath as a young man...

356
00:24:57,339 --> 00:24:59,398
never to just stand around
and watch people die.

357
00:24:59,475 --> 00:25:03,912
I took the same oath, pal.
I didn't ask to be here.

358
00:25:03,979 --> 00:25:07,642
Yeah, me neither.
I guess that makes about 80,000 of us.

359
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:10,742
You know what?
If we had any guts,

360
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:13,288
you, me and the Masked Marvel there...

361
00:25:13,355 --> 00:25:16,415
would take the next latrine
out of here and go home.

362
00:25:19,161 --> 00:25:24,072
Put the queen on the king.
The queen on the king.
