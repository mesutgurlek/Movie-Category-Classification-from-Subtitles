When the people
learned of your decision
to free the livestock,

they left the temple
in protest.

Palamedes, get out of here!
What's happened?
Where's Melanippe?

456
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:37,148
[ Laughing Maniacally ]

457
00:28:42,036 --> 00:28:44,289
[ Laughing ]

458
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:49,544
Smokin'!

459
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:51,513
[ Augeus Laughing ]

460
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:55,950
[ Salmoneus ]
Hold on, Hercules!
We're coming! Hold on!

461
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:09,748
- Palamedes?
- [ Both Grunting ]

462
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,083
Palamedes.

463
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,954
Father!

464
00:29:20,041 --> 00:29:23,912
I'm sorry. He's dead.

465
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,011
[ Sobbing ]

466
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,264
Hercules?
I don't get it.

467
00:29:43,264 --> 00:29:46,100
How could Augeus throw
real lightning bolts?

468
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,953
Hera gave him
the powers of a god.

469
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,272
She wants him to kill me
by sundown.

470
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:53,241
[ Gasps ]

471
00:29:53,241 --> 00:29:56,127
Aphrodite?
Wait.
You can see her?

472
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:58,129
Yeah.

473
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:02,016
This time Hera's gone
too far, giving that
crazy king those powers.

474
00:30:02,016 --> 00:30:06,287
Please. Please.
My father didn't
deserve this fate.

475
00:30:06,287 --> 00:30:09,224
You're a goddess.
Isn't there something
you can do to help him?

476
00:30:09,724 --> 00:30:11,976
[ Sighs ]
I'm sorry.

477
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:16,414
If you want to marry a prince,
that I can do,

478
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:20,451
but this is totally
out of my league.

479
00:30:20,451 --> 00:30:24,639
How can you just let him
die like this, after all
we've done to honor you?

480
00:30:25,123 --> 00:30:27,025
Please.
[ Sobbing ]

481
00:30:27,025 --> 00:30:29,027
Please, can't you
bring him back?

482
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:34,399
Okay.

483
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:37,202
Hades owes me one.
I can call in a marker.

484
00:30:37,202 --> 00:30:40,338
But this is a one-time deal.
You understand?

485
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:49,397
This aura will keep his spirit
from going to the other side,

486
00:30:49,397 --> 00:30:52,166
but it's only good
until nightfall.

487
00:30:52,166 --> 00:30:55,753
- But there's--
- I'm sorry.
  It's the best I can do.

488
00:31:00,141 --> 00:31:02,644
Don't worry.

489
00:31:02,644 --> 00:31:05,680
Hercules will find a way
to bring him back.

490
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,849
Won't you?

491
00:31:07,849 --> 00:31:11,069
Yeah.

492
00:31:17,225 --> 00:31:20,478
[ Sobbing ]

493
00:31:25,483 --> 00:31:27,485
Aphrodite.
[ Sobbing Continues ]

494
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:29,988
Uh, are you crying?

495
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,991
Can't a goddess have
a little privacy?

496
00:31:34,993 --> 00:31:39,213
I didn't realize Palamedes
meant that much to you.

497
00:31:39,213 --> 00:31:42,216
He respected me...

498
00:31:42,216 --> 00:31:44,719
for what he saw
below the surface.

499
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:48,089
Well, he's a special man.

500
00:31:50,091 --> 00:31:54,012
I've just never seen
you like this, at least
not over a mortal.

501
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:57,015
Do you think
I don't have feelings?

502
00:31:57,515 --> 00:32:00,268
Maybe you don't know me
as well as you thought you did.

503
00:32:00,268 --> 00:32:04,455
Maybe not.
I'll leave you alone.

504
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:07,358
What are you gonna do?

505
00:32:07,358 --> 00:32:10,862
I'm gonna see if I can find
a way to revive Palamedes...

506
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:14,115
and stop Augeus before he
destroys the whole kingdom.

507
00:32:14,115 --> 00:32:16,417
Maybe I can help.

508
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:19,904
I could keep the king busy
while you work on Palamedes.

509
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,692
That's a good idea.

510
00:32:24,692 --> 00:32:28,196
Just remember, that aura
only works until sundown.

511
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:32,684
What is it with
gods and sundown?

512
00:32:36,971 --> 00:32:40,892
This time,
right down the middle!

513
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:43,861
-Sire!
- Oh, for the love
  of me, what now?

514
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:47,732
- The troops are ready to march
  on the city, as you commanded.
- [ Groaning ]

515
00:32:47,732 --> 00:32:51,536
Good. It's time my subjects
gave me the respect I deserve.

516
00:32:51,536 --> 00:32:56,824
I'm afraid they're gonna
have to learn the hard way,
like General Machus here!

517
00:32:56,824 --> 00:32:59,277
[ Aphrodite ]
Daddy!
[ Yells ]

518
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:01,562

Aphrodite.

520
00:33:03,831 --> 00:33:07,301
Shouldn't you be at...
goddess finishing school
or something?

Expelled.
Bad attitude.

522
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:13,074
Actually, I've been thinking
that, with Hercules gone,

523
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:17,078
we should really be spending
some more time together.

524
00:33:17,078 --> 00:33:20,081
So... I'm moving in.
Moving in?

525
00:33:20,081 --> 00:33:22,083
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.
Here?

526
00:33:22,083 --> 00:33:25,086
Sire! The troops
are waiting!

527
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:28,973
Uh, tell 'em to,
 uh, stand down.

528
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:36,581
You're right, kitten.
Family comes first.

529
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,787
[ Salmoneus ]
Lovely, aren't they?

530
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,291
You're doing excellent work.
Excellent.

531
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,294
Now, as soon as you emboss
the rest of these, the market
for commemorative coins...

532
00:33:50,294 --> 00:33:52,296
[ Snapping Fingers ]
will be... open.

533
00:33:52,296 --> 00:33:55,800
Speaking of which,
when am I gonna be paid?
Keep your tunic on.

534
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,803
I'm good for it.
 I'm short of cash right now.

535
00:33:58,803 --> 00:34:02,306
How do you feel about
taking manure in trade?
You gotta be kidding, right?

536
00:34:02,306 --> 00:34:04,308
Kidding? This is
no ordinary manure!

537
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:07,812
I'm talking about the stuff
Hercules cleaned out of
the Augean Stables in his youth.

538
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:11,816
So you wanna pay me
with cow dung?
I'm not talking about cow dung.

539
00:34:11,816 --> 00:34:14,318
This... is a piece
of history.

540
00:34:14,318 --> 00:34:17,822
This is the stuff
of legends... and gods.

541
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:21,325
Holy--
Exactly. You can't put a price
on something like this.

542
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:25,329
And for your efforts,
I'm willing to part with,
shall we say, four bags.

543
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,332
You're lowballing me.
Five bags.
My final offer.

544
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:31,335
Salmoneus, have you seen
that copper arm from
Aphrodite's statue?

545
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:33,337
It's over there.
We melted it down.

546
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,840
That's all right. Thanks.
Where are you going
with that?

547
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,843
Don't worry.
It's for a good cause.
I paid good money for that!

548
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:43,314
[ Moaning ]
And then she told me that she
said that I never said that,

549
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:45,316
which is totally
not true.

550
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:49,320
So I told Athena to tell Artemis
that if she didn't return
the sandals she borrowed,

551
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,823
I was going-- Oh!

Is there a problem,

Hercules is still alive,
you idiot!

that's impossible.

while we speak.

Why do you think
she's here?

00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:16,447
Why... are you here?

That's not true... entirely.

will come to you,

and I expect you
to finish the job!

You sure this
is gonna work?

00:36:18,192 --> 00:36:21,946
Nope, but it's worth a shot.
I've seen lightning do
a lot of strange things,

574
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:24,582
and I'm hoping a strong enough
blast might revive Palamedes.

575
00:36:24,582 --> 00:36:28,236
Uh-huh. And you really think
you can control lightning
with a piece of copper?

576
00:36:28,236 --> 00:36:31,572
[ Chuckles ]
Old buddy, you've taken
too many blows to the head.

577
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:34,575
And where do these
lightning bolts come from?

578
00:36:34,575 --> 00:36:37,962
You're gonna let Augeus stand
there and throw them at you?
Yeah.

[ Wheels Squeaking ]

00:36:45,853 --> 00:36:48,222
Excuse us. We need
to get inside the temple.

00:36:48,222 --> 00:36:51,442
- The temple is closed.
- Please. This is important.

583

I'm sure it is,
but the only way you're
getting inside that temple...

584
00:36:55,229 --> 00:36:57,698
is over our dead bodies.

Uh, you might want
to rephrase that.

use more training. Hmm.

00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:32,143
[ Salmoneus ]
The statue!

607
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,512
[ Melanippe ]
That was close.

608
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,348
-[ Salmoneus ]
 Whoo! So was that!
- Yeah.

609
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:40,785
Daddy's home!
[ Laughing ]

610
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:43,070
You guys keep
your heads down!
No problem.

611
00:38:46,941 --> 00:38:50,444
Okay, Augeus, hit me
with your best shot.

612
00:38:50,444 --> 00:38:52,797
Augeus. Oh, that's it,
young man.

613
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:54,682
You are grounded.

614
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:56,717
[ Grunts ]

615
00:39:01,655 --> 00:39:05,192
That tears it.
We're talking big-time
retribution now.

616
00:39:08,479 --> 00:39:10,815
[ Yelling ]

617
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,905
When you see Hades,

618
00:39:17,905 --> 00:39:22,243
tell him Zeus
sends his best!

619
00:39:22,243 --> 00:39:24,211
Aah!

620
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,833
[ Grunts ]

621
00:39:30,251 --> 00:39:33,788
[ Yelling, Grunts ]

622
00:39:35,022 --> 00:39:37,708
Now who's grounded?

623
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:45,266
Father!

624
00:39:45,266 --> 00:39:47,251
He's alive! Alive!

625
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:55,109
[ Groaning ]
Augeus.

626
00:39:57,111 --> 00:40:00,114
[ Coughing ]
Smoke. That stuff'll kill ya.

627
00:40:00,114 --> 00:40:02,116
[ Groans ]

628
00:40:02,116 --> 00:40:05,503
Hercules, what are
you doing here?

629
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:07,505
[ Sighs ]

630
00:40:07,505 --> 00:40:10,508
I feel like I've been
run over by a chariot.

631
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:13,511
Actually, it was more
like lightning, but don't worry.
I know a good healer.

632
00:40:13,511 --> 00:40:15,513
Come on.
Whoa!

633
00:40:18,883 --> 00:40:21,385
[ Laughs ]
Oh.

634
00:40:21,385 --> 00:40:23,888
Palamedes. You're back.

635
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:26,157
Thanks to you.

636
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:29,593
We can take care of him now.
Are you sure
he's up to this?

637
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,596
I'm fine.
And I'll help out.

638
00:40:32,596 --> 00:40:36,600
Father and Augeus have
been friends for so long,
it's almost like they're family.

639
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:41,105
Palamedes. Oh, thank
the gods it's you.

640
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:44,108
Come on, Augeus,
old friend.

641
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,610
Actually,
the name's Ulysses.

642
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,113
Perhaps you've
heard of me, huh?

643
00:40:49,113 --> 00:40:54,118
I've been thinking about
having a little cruise
around the Mediterranean.

644
00:40:56,971 --> 00:40:59,974
Now, what's the deal?
300 dinars for
this work of art.

645
00:40:59,974 --> 00:41:02,977
Not in this lifetime.
[ Laughing ]

646
00:41:02,977 --> 00:41:05,980
It's an original.
The nerve of some people.

647
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:09,483
What now?
These guys
from Milo, trying to sell me
that statue of Aphrodite.

648
00:41:09,483 --> 00:41:13,220
They think I was born yesterday?
What good is a statue
without arms?

649
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:15,055
Aphrodite de Milo, ha!

650
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:17,558
[ Laughs ]

651
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:20,060
He's right.
They should fix it.

652
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,063
I don't know.
 I kind of like it.

653
00:41:24,565 --> 00:41:27,067
By the way, I never
got to thank you.

654
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:31,071
For what?
For putting that aura
around Palamedes,

655
00:41:31,071 --> 00:41:33,574
giving us a chance
to revive him.

656
00:41:33,574 --> 00:41:36,076
You're the one
who did all the work.

657
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:38,579
I never would have come up
with that lightning idea.

658
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:42,082
Well, you helped out a...
little bit there too.

659
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,335
Yeah, I did, didn't I?
Mm-hmm.

660
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,505
We work pretty well
together, big brother.
That we do.

661
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:50,441
And I got to see a side of you
I've never seen before.

662
00:41:50,441 --> 00:41:53,677
Really?
Which side is that?

663
00:41:53,677 --> 00:41:58,048
Yourinside,
and I liked what I saw.

664
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:02,436
I'd say you're
quite a piece of art,
with or without arms.

665
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,388
Really?

666
00:42:05,723 --> 00:42:07,775
Really.

667
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,779
You're so cool sometimes!
