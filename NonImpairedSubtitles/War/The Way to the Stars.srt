<i>- Jones is the name</i>
- <i>O</i>h, right.

This is your chest of drawers, sir.

27
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:56,310
Flight Lieutenant Archdale,
he's been keeping a lot of his stuff in here, sir.

28
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,359
lf you speak to him nicely, he won 't mind moving
them. He's a nice gentleman , Mr Archdale.

29
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:02,715
- That his tunic?
- Yes, sir. That's his best.

30
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,916
The one he wears when he goes into Shepley.

31
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,309
He's got a good reason for going into Shepley.

32
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,198
All the fuss he makes about his buttons
in the evening.

33
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:14,592
He got this DFC, sir, for that low-level do
over Rotterdam. l expect you read about it.

34
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,908
Yes, l did.

(Distant ack-ack guns)

36
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,159
- ls there a raid on ?
-No, sir. Well, at least not here.

37
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,279
lt's over at Marston , seven miles away.
Jerry's been giving it to them all the morning.

38
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,874
Yes, l thought l heard
the sirens going in Shepley.

39
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,791
We don 't take shelter for the sirens here.

40
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,270
But if you hear whistles being blown ,
take my tip and run like a ruddy rabbit.

00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,475
(Door opens)

42
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:37,314
Jonesy, you silly clot!
You sent me dicing without my lighter.

43
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,757
l'm sorry, sir. l took it away to mend it. Won 't take
a minute. l had no idea you were flying, sir.

44
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,115
l've just been up on air test and what happened?

45
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,192
l come into land, sideslip to miss
one of those damned bomb craters,

46
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,750
get caught up in someone else's slipstream
and ruddy nearly pranged the kite.

Lucky the C<i>O</i> didn 't see it.

49
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,510
l'm ever so sorry, sir. l'll go and get it now.

50
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,956
- Mr Penrose, sir. He just got in .
- <i>O</i>h, hello. l heard you were coming.

51
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,712
- My name's Archdale.
- Yes, l know.

52
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,872
l've taken up lots more room than l should.
l'll clear some stuff out.

53
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,714
- Don 't bother. There's bags of room.
- They're putting you in my flight, ''B'' Flight.

54
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,631
- Straight from <i>O</i>TU, aren 't you?
- Yes.

55
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,757
- What did they rate you , above average?
-No. Average.

56
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,876
<i>O</i>h, well, we'll soon change all that.

57
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,350
There's a bit of a do on this afternoon .
lt's apt to get a bit chilly at 1 5,000.

58
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,238
l thought that daylight Blenheims
were doing low-level jobs.

59
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,596
All levels. All jobs. Nothing a Blenheim
won 't do, if you treat her right.

60
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,234
- Here you are, sir.
- Ah, thank you , Jonesy.

61
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,713
St Christopher?

62
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,233
Sort of. Yes.

63
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,754
Now, what are we going to do
with all this stuff of mine?

64
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,753
l don 't know, sir. Unless l could pinch a chest
of drawers from that Mr Thompson 's room.

65
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:45,479
- The one that...bought it yesterday.
- Good idea.

66
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,232
What's that thing mean ?

67
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:52,596
<i>O</i>h, that. l got it in a Jerry train in peacetime.
lt means...

68
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,240
<i>""Under the washbasin there finds itself a pot ""</i>

69
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:59,233
l looked under the washbasin and there didn 't
find itself any such thing, so l pinched it.

70
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,515
The sentiment's a bit crude, but it's decorative.

71
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:02,555
(Whistle)

72
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:04,596
That's Halfpenny Field. Come on , quick!

73
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,471

76
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,273
- Where are the Hurries from?
- Local defence. Attached to us.

77
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,920
- Bad chance, three against 30.
- <i>O</i>h, l don 't know.

78
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,558
(Whistle of bomb)

79
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,033
(Explosion)

80
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,076
- Hello, Tiny.
- Hello, David.

81
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:52,038
Frankly, l'm scared.
l don 't like them as close as this.

82
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,238
This is Penrose, just joined the Squadron .
Tiny Williams, controller, shocking type.

83
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,878
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

84
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,153
(Engine drones)

85
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,593
Ssh!

86
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,638
l thought l heard something.
Let's get to the shelter.

87
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:11,229
Right through to the end.
Come on . Don 't jam the doorway. Hurry up.

88
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,673
(Distant explosion)

89
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,910
- Where did that one fall?
- By the market square.

90
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:15,955
Duck!

91
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,238
- Close?
- Fairly.

94
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:34,120
- kick him, somebody.
- l'm only telling you what l heard.

95
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,998
The trouble is you always hear
such ruddy depressing things.

96
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,594
Funny how Jerry always comes over
at our PT time, Sarge.

97
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:42,319
Don 't you worry, my boy.
You won 't miss your PT.

98
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,355
(Explosion)

99
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,000
More ruddy craters. lt makes you sick.

100
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,152
You break your back filling 'em in
and Jerry digs up some more.

101
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,992
There's the C<i>O</i>.

102
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,828
This is Pilot <i>O</i>fficer Penrose, sir.
He arrived today.

103
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,876
- How do you do?
- How do you do, sir?

104
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,190
Any relation of ''Nipper'' Penrose,
840 Squadron ?

105
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,633
No, sir.

106
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,278
Grand type, old Nipper,

107
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,715
- How many hours have you done in Blenheims?
- 1 5, sir.

108
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:08,951
1 5? What do they think they're doing
at <i>O</i>TU, these days?

109
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,989
l know there's a bit of a flap on at the moment,
but 1 5 hours? lt's a bit thick, l must say.

110
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,152
- He passed out pretty high in his course, sir.
- Did you? Good show.

111
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,673
Above average?

112
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,318
Er, no, sir. Average.

113
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,356
l can 't promise you much time to settle down .

114
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,908
- The Squadron is hard-worked at the moment.
- Yes, sir.

115
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,955
(klaxon)

116
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,634
All clear. Come along to the crew room
and meet the blokes.

117
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,113
(Fire engine bell)

118
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,950
Well, if Jerry thinks he can put Halfpenny Field
out of action , he's making a big mistake.

119
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,436
As long as we've got 200 clear yards of turf,
we'll get off somehow.

120
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:07,439
Line shoot.

121
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,436
These fighter types, you know?

122
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:12,272
Top button undone.

123
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,713
Victory rolls.

124
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,233
Bad show, l think.

125
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:19,874
That's two of them. Can you see the third?

126
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,953
No, sir.

127
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,432
Mind you , l'm not saying they're not doing
a good job, at the moment.

128
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:35,033
DAVlD: <i>No Shepley 1 65</i>

Hello. The Golden Lion ?

00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,358
Who's that? Fred?

131
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,356
Flight Lieutenant Archdale here.

132
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,154
No. No, don 't bother her now.
l just wanted to know if everything was all right.

133
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,470
- Who's that, Fred?
- lt's the aerodrome, madam.

134
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,836
Flight Lieutenant Archdale.
Just wanted to know if we were all right.

135
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,074
Hold on , sir. l'm putting you through now.

136
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,433
Hello, David.

137
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,436
No, nothing at all near here.

138
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,348
Well, not really ''near''. How's the airfield?

139
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,956
Good. Thank you for ringing.

140
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,469
Your snapshots?
Yes, l've had them developed for you .

141

- <i>O</i>h, David!

You won 't be going on this afternoon 's trip.

144
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,556
- Arthur! You'll lead B Flight.
- Right, sir.

145
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,916
l'm sending you up with Penrose
to give him a look round, see how he gets on .

146
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,991
The sooner we get him operational the better.

147
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:37,435
- Can 't Arthur go with him, sir?
-No, David. Sorry.

148

- Clarke, sir.
- Sergeant Clarke!

153
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:51,954
Sir.

154
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,918
l'm sending you up to stooge around
with Pilot <i>O</i>fficer Penrose.

155
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,514
We don 't want you running into
500 plus Messerschmitts.

156
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,795
- You'd better get a route from <i>O</i>ps.
- Right, sir.

157
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:03,031
Well, chaps, as you know,
the target for this afternoon

158
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,676
Calais. Barge concentrations.

159
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,639
- Bill Thompson was about your size.
- Thanks.

160
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,033
Superstitious?

161
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,678
Er... No, no.

162
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:23,433
- Just going to sign the 700. Won 't be a minute.
- Righto.

163
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:33,478
(Station fades)

164
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,709
(lnterference)

165
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,552
The Home Service has gone, too.

166
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:38,312
Punctual blighter, Jerry.

167
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,958
Same time yesterday.

168
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,759
Probably having another big shot
at reaching London .

169
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,553
Well, Penrose,
what got you into the flying racket?

170
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,596
Three pints of beer, l think!

171
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,113
l don 't know, really.

172
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,034
l had to do something about it and l felt
l'd sooner do it this way than any other.

173
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:00,556
- What did you do before that?
- l was a schoolmaster at a secondary school.

174
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:03,757
- l'm just an amateur.
- There aren 't any amateurs and professionals.

175
00:13:03,840 --> 00:13:05,796
Just good pilots and bad pilots.

176
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,519
The good pilots stay alive
and the bad ones don 't.

177
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,556
That's not true any more, either.

178
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,914
Thanks.

179
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,959
- Break your blooming heart, wouldn 't it?
- Just my luck. Another 1 5-hour sprog.

180
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:17,473
Look out. Here he is.

181
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:19,999
- Afternoon , sir.
- Afternoon .

182
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:23,789
The port engine's not giving the revs
she should, sir. Careful not to overheat her.

183
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:28,237
She's a bit overdue for a major, sir, but the
Engineering <i>O</i>fficer, he says we can 't spare her.

184
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:32,078
lt's a wicked shame to treat aircraft like this, sir.

185
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,196
Mark my words, no good will come of it.

186
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,713
Thanks very much.

187
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,156
The new bloke, sir,
l bet his first takeoff's worse than mine was.

188
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,673
l doubt it.

189
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,995
<i>O</i>FFlCER: <i>Wel he missed the control tower</i>

190
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,116
Come on , chaps. Time to get cracking.

191
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,792
(Hum of Blenheims)

192
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,313
Mr Palmer.

193
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,072
A fine sight, isn 't it?

194
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,189
Hello.

195
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,389
<i>O</i>h, hello.

196
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:14,236
- <i>O</i>ne missing, isn 't there?
- Yes.

197
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,276
We don 't know which one yet.

198
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,909
- Had a good trip?
-Not bad. Just a stooge around, you know.

199
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,514
- How do you like flying Blenheims?
- Very much.

200
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:26,354
They take a bit of flying, of course,
but l'd sooner handle them than most types.

201
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,034
- You've flown a lot of types?
- A fair number, you know?

202
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:34,069
Blenheims are pretty easy. l suppose they'll
make me operational straightaway, won 't they?

203
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,713
(Sighs)

204
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,075
You can 't fly a Blenheim to save your life.

205
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,913
And there's not only your life
to be considered, either.

206
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:48,077
You'll go on operations
when l think you're fit and not before.

207
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,628
l only thought, that with the shortage of pilots...

208
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,554
lf l let you fly on ops in your present state,
l'd only be adding to the shortage.

209
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,556
That landing was ruddy awful.

210
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,313
Don 't go, Tiny. l want to speak to you , presently.

211
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,517
lf you make another landing like that,
l'll send you back to <i>O</i>TU,

212
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,875
Battle of Britain or no Battle of Britain .

213
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,313
Sorry.

214
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,356
Why didn 't you go round again ?

215
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,113
Well, l thought l could...get her down all right.

216
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,553
<i>O</i>h.

217
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:17,838
Well, next time, you might remember
that you've got other people flying with you .

218
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,273
Right.

219
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,238
(Footsteps approaching)

220
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:25,072
(Sombre whistle)

221
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,872
- Hello, Tiny.
- Hello, old boy.

222
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,396
The C<i>O</i> bought it this afternoon .

223
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,913
(Empties pipe)

224
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,355
That's what l wanted to see you about, Tiny.

225
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:01,356
l suppose they'll make me Acting C<i>O</i>.

226
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,793
sseo

227
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,955
l'll send another bloke up with you this
afternoon , to do some circuits and bumps.

228
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,393
Yes, sir.

229
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,192
<i>And Penrose</i>

230
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,236
l think you'll make a pilot, all right.

231
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:15,673
Thanks.

232
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,312
(Hum of Blenheim)

233
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,152
- <i>O</i>h, hello, sir.
- Hello, Sergeant.

234
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:25,316
Sorry about making such a clot of myself.

235
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,356
What do you mean , sir, that landing?

236
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:29,908
Ta. l've had worse than that, don 't you worry.

237
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,117
<i>O</i>ld Bill Thompson ,
he used to be my pilot till he bought it.

238
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,636
He used to do some real shakers.
Break every bone in your body.

239
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,593
Poor old Bill.

240
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,238
Yours was nothing.

241
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,673
Thanks.

242
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,278
- Going Shepley way?
- Yes, sir.

243
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,272
- Jump in . What about you , Penrose?
- Thanks very much, sir.

244
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,556
(Church bell tolls)

245
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,030
- Hello, Miss Todd.
- Hello, Flight Lieutenant.

246
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:16,315
- This is Pilot <i>O</i>fficer Penrose.
- How do you do?

247
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,075
Don 't forget to wipe your feet before you go in
the lounge. l've told you before.

248
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,718
Most terribly sorry.

249
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,512
- She the manageress?
- Mm-hm.

250
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,272
Bit of a tartar, isn 't she?

251
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,590
<i>O</i>h, her bark's worse than her bite.

252
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,955
Boys, have a drink. l expect you deserve it.

253
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,792
- No, thanks.
- Come on . Don 't be shy.

254
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,110
- Palmer's the name.
- Pilot <i>O</i>fficer Penrose.

255
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,317
Two large Highland Flings.
Must support the old firm, you know.

256
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,396
Well, been giving those old barges a caning?

257
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,439
That's the stuff. <i>O</i>nly, save a few Jerries
for the LDV. l'm rather hot with my pike!

258
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,078
(Palmer chuckles)

259
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,912
l... <i>O</i>h, l beg your pardon .

260
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,560
The Misses Winterton , major and minor.

261
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,198
- Mr...?
- Penrose

262
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:55,032
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

263
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,678
How do you do?

264
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,915
Would you care for a drink, Miss Winterton ?

265
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,752
No, thank you . We don 't drink.

266
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,193
<i>O</i>h.

267
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,196
What's that you're making?

268
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,033
- An air-force pullover.
- For anyone in particular?

269
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,394
No.

270
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,436
- Just for the Comforts Fund.
- <i>O</i>h.

271
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,393
lt's a bit erm...difficult
making those squiggly bits round the collar.

272
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,913
No, it isn 't, really.

273
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,752
You see, when you get to the end...

274
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:22,876
lris, dear, we'd better have our dinner now,

275
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,918
otherwise we shall find
it's all been eaten by the non -residents.

276
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,353
Yes, Auntie.

277
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,873
<i>O</i>h, Miss Todd!

278
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,999
- You know l never complain ...
- Yes. Will you come to my office after dinner?

279
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,193
lris!

280
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,838
Coming, Auntie.

281
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:43,912
Now, if they'd drop a bomb on Auntie,
instead of Halfpenny Field...

282
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,353
She need it?

283
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:51,358
- <i>O</i>h, hello.
- Hello.

284
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,152
- Can l help you?
- Yes. Here.

285
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,992
You wipe while l wash.

286
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,679
<i>O</i>ne of the bar boys left this morning. Called up.

287
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,958
- Did you go over this afternoon ?
-No. The Squadron did.

288
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,438
We lost our C<i>O</i>.

289
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,192
Squadron Leader Carter?

290
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,798
l'm terribly sorry.

291
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,632
Yes. lt's a bad show.

292
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,230
He was a great friend of yours, wasn 't he?

293
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,072
l knew him pretty well.

294
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,118
ls there any hope?

295
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,156
No-one saw him or his crew bail out.

296
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:33,789
They'll post them as missing, l suppose,
for three months, anyway.

297
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:37,352
l think if l had to hear...

298
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,072
..someone was killed...

299
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:44,430
..l'd rather hear it at once,
than hear it first as ''missing''.

300
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,630
Yes, it is rather an ugly word, isn 't it?

301
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,113
know a

302
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,952
kind of poem called Missing.

303
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,393
Do you?

304
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,752
Less said the better.

305
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,910
The bill unpaid. The dead letter.

306
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,356

For Smith, our brother...

..only son of loving mother...

311
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,389
..the ocean lifted, stirred...

312
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,396
..leaving no word.

You wrote that...yourself.

Fine bar boy, l am, spouting poetry at you .

00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:01,352
The German pilot says to the Girl Guide,
''Which way is to the station ?''

321
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:03,954
She said, ''l don 't know.
l'm a parachutist here myself.''

322
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,198
- Not bad, eh?
-Not bad.

- Going to bed already?
- Yes. Auntie doesn 't like us staying up late.

324
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,430
Well, l suppose there's not very much
to stay up for in a place like Shepley.

325
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,590
- No, there isn 't.

to get the room warm.

Yes, Auntie.

Never mind. Hear about the man in the shelter?

The woman in the shelter... Wait a minute. Er...

-No, but l shouldn 't worry.

What is the time? l know we shall be late.

There's plenty of time. Don 't fuss.

There.

No , you won't

Nothing.

Ladies and gentlemen ,

ALL: <i>Hear hear !</i>

367
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,750
To the bridegroom, l would say this.

368
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:41,912
May his matrimonial takeoff
be straight and smooth.

369
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,996
May his climb through the clouds
of married bliss be swift and controlled.

370
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,311
May his navigation be sure, his air speed steady

371
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:54,870
and may all his engine troubles be little ones.

372
00:24:57,920 --> 00:25:00,514
To the bride, l would merely say this.

373
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,828
(Whistle)

374
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:02,875

(klaxon)

377
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:15,470
Come on . Slide along, Corporal. Slide along.

378
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,312
Up a wee bit. That's it.

379
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:27,872

(Chuckles) Halfpenny?

386
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,990
That's a funny kind of a name.

387
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,029
Well, it seems in 1 066,
the owner used to pay a ''halfpenny'' rent for it.

388
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,230
That was our biggest crater.
<i>O</i>ver there. By that Boston .

389
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:24,870
That damn port engine's
still not giving me anything like the right boost.

390
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,952
- Why wasn 't it fixed?
- l thought it was. We worked on it all morning.

391
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,271
lf you want to break our ruddy necks,
you're going the right way about it.

392
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,316
See it's fixed by 1 430 this afternoon , eh?

00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,550
Yes, sir. Shall l put it ''US'', then , sir?

Yes, sir.

396
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,832
What's the matter, Dad?

397
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,754
lf you ask me, son , l think it's about time
that young chap had a bit of a rest.

398
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,153
Yeah.

399
00:26:50,560 --> 00:26:52,790
This way, sir. This is the officers' mess

400
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,836
and this is the anteroom.

401

(ln mock American accent) ..gee, what a honey!

402
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:59,589
- What a ship!

<i>- Yeah gentlemen the B 1</i> 7
(Tiny coughs)

404
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,198
<i>""The Flying Fortress"" as we cal her is surely</i>
<i>the greatest bombing ship God ever made</i>

Why, it cruises at 650.

406
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:11,032
Well, let's say 645.
We mustn 't exaggerate, must me, gentlemen ?

407
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,634
(Tiny coughs loudly )
- This bombing ship is the only ship

that will fly in ever-decreasing circles,
until finally it shoots itself down .

Gosh.

The B17 is a mighty fast machine, son ,
but l don 't think it's quite as fast as all that.

413
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,633
No, sir.

- Thank you .

419

ls it true, sir, l mean , about the rumour?

420
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,033
What rumour?

<i>O</i>h, uh, that.

00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,513
Well, as you'll all get to hear about it,
sooner or later, yes, it's perfectly true.

423
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,639
That Halfpenny Field is being taken over
by the Yan ...by the American Air Corps, sir?

424
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:02,156
- By the Eight Air Force.
- What sort of aircraft? A20s?

425
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,673
No, B17s.

Better not be or l'll murder that ground crew.

- How would that appeal to you , Prune?
- What do you think of that, Peter?

435
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,869
Soft, languorous nights,

Will you come with me, Peter?

Well, then for Pete's sake, shut up.

442
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,118
l was having an argument with a bloke.
How many trips have you done? He said 41 .

443
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,633
43. Why?

444
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:57,995
That's what l said. Not bad for one tour.

445
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,036
What do you mean , ''one tour''?

446
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:04,636
After this afternoon 's trip, you'll have finished
your first tour of ops. Congratulations, Peter.

Yes, for a bit.

Now, listen , David,

452
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:22,596
l came into the RAF to fly,

453
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:25,797
not to sit on the ground
using a lot of brains l haven 't got.

454
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:30,635
lf you applied for me to be taken off flying, you
damn well better apply for me to be put back.

455
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:34,030
l don 't blame you for putting up a moan .
That's why l didn 't tell you before.

456
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:37,237
How could you have done,
if my posting only came through this morning?

457
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,672
So you <i>did</i> apply.

458

All right. Yes, l did.

459
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,757
- Darling! Where are you?
- Don 't make such a noise. You'll wake Peter.

460
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,638
- Hello, Peter.
- Hello, Toddy.

461
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,278
- She's in there.
- Alone?

462
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,793
- She was.
- Good.

463
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:55,796
- How's our Peter?
- Come and have a look.

464
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,676
- ls it all right?
- Yes. Why?

465
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,716
Well, it looks sort of screwed up.

466
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:08,951
Well, of course it looks screwed up.
So did you at his age.

467
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:11,076
Not as screwed up as all that, surely?

468
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,720
- Are you sure it's not in pain ?
- <i>O</i>f course not.

469
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,552
Can l pick it up?

470
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,794
No, David, please don 't. You'll ruin my morning
if you wake him - and it's ''him'', not ''it'', please.

471
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,509
lt'll always be ''it'' to me,
till it begins to look a little more human .

472
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,034
That's the way to hold a baby.
<i>O</i>ur M<i>O</i> showed me.

473
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:28,917
(Peter gurgles)
- <i>O</i>h. Here.

474
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,518
Darling, ssh!

475
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,516
Did naughty Daddy wake him?

476
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,068
Naughty Daddy's got to get the hell out of here.

477
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,596
- l left my lighter in our room. Did you see it?
-No, it wasn 't with your things.

478
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:42,636
<i>O</i>h. l'll just dash up and have a look.

479
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,153
- David.
- Mm-hm?

480
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:45,992
- ls there something on ?
- Yes.

481
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:48,992
l know l shouldn 't ask, but...
ls it anything important?

482
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,150
(Peter cries)
- Just the usual stooge around.

483
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,953
<i>O</i>h, darling.

484
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,393
Ssh.

485
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,313
But, surely, we could have dinner alone
somewhere?

486
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,152
Auntie would never agree to it.

487
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,912
Well, l'll ask her tonight.

488
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,958
As a matter of fact,
l'll have something to ask you , too.

489
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:07,393
<i>O</i>h?

490
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:09,232
Anything very important?

491
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,799
Well...

492
00:31:10,880 --> 00:31:13,838
lt depends which way you look at it.

493
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,440
l can 't find it. lt must be at the station , after all.

494
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:22,671
- You <i>will</i> find it, won 't you?
- <i>O</i>h, yes, l'll find it, all right.

495
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:24,716
Yes, l think l know where it is.

496
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,756
Give me a ring when you get down .

497
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:28,592
Have l ever forgotten ?

498
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,432
No. Not yet.

499
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,753
Well, darling.

500
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:36,153
(knock at door)

501
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,031
Ah, there you are, Miss Todd.

502
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:43,789
<i>l suppose l shoul say ""Mrs Archdale ""</i>
<i>but l can never get used to it</i>

503
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,440
There's something l want to see you about.

504
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:49,637
lf you'll go down to my office,
l'll be with you in five minutes.

505
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:52,837
Now l'm up the stairs,
l think l'd better stay up them, don 't you?

506
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,876
They're so bad for my heart, you know.

507
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,916
<i>It"s about my bottle of Worcester sauce</i>

508
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,353
- Bye, darling.
- Goodbye.

509
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,714
David!

510
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:01,552
Yes, darling?

511
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,112
lt doesn 't matter.

512
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,191
See you tonight.

513
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,399
Now, l noticed this morning at breakfast,
when we had fish cakes, remember?

514
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,278
<i>Of course l always like Worcester sauce</i>
<i>with fish cakes</i>

515
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:20,874
especially when they're the least little bit
tasteless,

516
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:23,918
l noticed that someone had been tampering
with my bottle.

517
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,433
- Peter!
<i>- OK</i>

518
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,152
- Goodbye, David.
- Bye!

519
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:33,514
Well...

520
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,272
See you tonight, eh?

521
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,918
- Promise?
- Promise.

522
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,916
Don 't talk to any strange men , will you?

523
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,518
Everything all right?

524
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:53,273
lf you have any trouble with it now,
you can knock my head off.

525
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,112
l will. lf l'm still here to do it.

526
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,150
- k eep in fairly close going over.
- Right.

527
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:02,198
- How are you feeling, all right?
- <i>O</i>f course l'm feeling all right.

528
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:05,556
- l've got Prune standing by, if...
- l'm not a controller yet, you know.

529
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,996
Look, Pete...you're not still
sulking with me, are you?

530
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:14,519
l'm sorry, David. lt was a bit of a shock,
you know, hearing it like that.

531
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,113
know

532
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,394
l suppose...

533
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,271
43 trips is quite a lot, isn 't it?

534
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,032
A heck of a lot.

535
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,076
Coming down to The Lion tonight?

536
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,832
You bet.

537
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,797
Don 't forget. k eep in close.

538
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,956
R Roger airborne. 1 1 00.

539
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:22,190
(Chuckles) Bang on the dot.

540
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,956
(Roar of Bostons overhead)

541
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,356
(Whistles to jaunty harmonica tune)

542
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,353
Hold it.

543
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,998
(Hum of aircraft)

544
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,598

(knock at door)

547
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,673
Come in .

548
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:41,556
<i>- Oh helo Tiny</i>
- Hello, old man .

549
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,558
l've just heard.

550
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,272
l'm terribly sorry.

551
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:50,396
Bad show, isn 't it?

552
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,754
Yes.

553
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,152
How did it happen ?

554
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,959
Light flak emplacement
on the roof of the power station .

555
00:37:03,040 --> 00:37:05,110
l suppose there's no chance that he might...?

556
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,553
No.

557
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,676
He went straight in from about 500 feet.

558
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,472
Caught fire at once.

559
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,834
l'm terribly sorry.

560
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,595
He should have evaded after dropping
his bombs. He told us to do it often enough.

561
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,557
l suppose he wanted to mark the bursts.

562
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:27,394
Hm, l suppose so, yeah. That's...
That's how old Campbell went, wasn 't it?

563
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,833
(Door opens)

564
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,876
Your shoes, sir. Nice and clean now.

565
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:36,196
Mr Parsons has just told me the news
about Squadron Leader Archdale, sir.

566
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,919
- Yes, bad show, isn 't it?
- Terrible, sir. Plain terrible.

567
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,072
l don 't know when l've been so upset.
He was my nicest gentleman .

568
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:45,948
<i>O</i>f course, it's worst of all for you , sir,
you being a particular pal of his. l...

569
00:37:57,720 --> 00:37:59,676
No. l... l hate mine.

570
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:02,320
Do you mind if l ask the PMC
if l can move in here?

571
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:03,958
Yes, if you like.

572
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,678
Peter...
You're going to tell his wife, aren 't you?

573
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:16,994
No.

574
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:20,914
l think you should. After all, you know her
much better than any of us.

575
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,752
l said, no. l won 't do it.

576
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:27,150
(Sighs) All right. Just as you think.

577
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,156
What's there to tell her?

578
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,277
Your husband crashed into a hill in France
and got burnt?

579
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,277
You'd better get the Adjutant
to write her one of those letters of his.

580
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,918
He knows what to say.

581
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,956
God knows he's had plenty of practice.

582
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:52,552
He'd got no right to get married...
and have a kid.

583
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,152
We none of us have.

584
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:07,558
There's someone here to see you , madam.
He's out in the hall.

585
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,156
Did he say what he wanted, Elsie?

586
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,959
l don 't know, madam. lt's Flying <i>O</i>fficer Penrose.

587
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,353
Thank you .

588
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,356
(Clock chimes the hour)

589
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,833
Hello, Peter.

590
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,194
Fred!

591
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,953
- Mr Palmer wants two whiskies and sodas.
- Very good, madam.

592
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,792
Come into my office, will you?

593
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,150
l know what you've come to tell me, Peter.

594
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,514
You do?

595
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,033
Yes, you see...

596
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:57,872
he didn 't ring up this evening

597
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,475
and l counted one plane missing
when you came back over the town .

598
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,272
Tell me just one thing.

599
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,316
How much hope is there?

600
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,913
sseo

601
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,752
No hope at all.

602
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,398
Not very much, l'm afraid.

603
00:40:19,480 --> 00:40:23,678
l thought perhaps there might have been some
question of ''missing''. lt does happen , l know.

604
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:28,038
Someone bails out, no-one sees them
and then later they're reported as a prisoner...

605
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:30,076
l'm afraid he was too low to bail out.

606
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,230
His plane crashed into a kind of a hill.

607
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,078
Whatever happened
would have been instantaneous.

608
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,957
You saw it?

609
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,598
Yes, l saw it.

610
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,790
Thank you for coming to tell me, Peter.

611
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:51,431
l know what it must have meant to you ,
but l couldn 't have borne it from anyone else.

612
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:52,873
Thank you .

613
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,353

615
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:15,279
l've brought a few things down ,
which l found up in my room.

616
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:18,432
Nothing very important.
Just handkerchiefs and socks and things.

617
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,556
l thought l'd better bring them down .

618

<i>O</i>h, and there...

619
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:27,199
There was a piece of paper with his writing on it,
which l thought you might like.

620
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,880
l can 't see without my glasses. What is it?

621
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,755
lt's er... lt's a bit of poetry, l think.

622
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:40,556
Will you read it for me?

623
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,596
- Well, l...
- Please.

''Do not despair for Johnny-head-in -air,

He sleeps as sound as Johnny underground.

626
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,675
Fetch out no shroud for Johnny-in -the-cloud...

627

And keep your tears for him in after years.

628
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,956
Better, by far,

629
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,996
for Johnny-the-bright-star...

630
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:18,996

633
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,311
He must have copied it
out of some book or something.

634
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,510
Yes, l... l suppose he must.

635
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:39,120
ls there anything else
that you would like me to do?

636

No, thank you , Peter.

637
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:45,395
l'll come down tomorrow and see you ,
of course. That's if you want me to?

638
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,870
Yes. l want you to.

639
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,758
Well, l'd erm...

645
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,752
He left his lighter behind.
l found it after we got down .

646
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,593
Probably upset him a bit having to fly without it.

647
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:13,236
Yes, it would have done.

- This is Wally Becker, navigator.
- How'd you do?

00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:29,793
Nice layout you got here.

705
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,111
And what do you know, Joe?
They got a lot of women here, on the station .

Hey, is that true?

707

Well, there are some WAAFs.

-No, l'm not a flyer.

They had A20s, here, Johnny.
''Bostons'', they call 'em.

- Not a bad little ship, that A20.
- All right for reconnaissance.

Not looking forward to bringing a Fort in here.

<i>O</i>r to being in it when you do!

Heck, we won 't. <i>O</i>ur bombs are going right

Say, have you ever seen a Flying Fortress?

725
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:23,752
Er, yes. From a distance.

726
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:26,115
- Like a trip in one?
- l would. Thanks very much.

727
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,270
Not a real mission , of course. They...

l uh... l thought you said you weren 't a flyer.

729

l'm not. l was once, though.

730
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:36,672
What did you fly?

731
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,309
A20s. Just reconnaissance work, you know.
l'll see you all in the mess.

732

Well, of all the dirty tricks!

Not hot. Cold.

Hot in coffee. Cold in tea.

748
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:38,358
<i>O</i>h, well. lt's liquid and it's warm. l was afraid

<i>O</i>h, but they were going to,
if l myself hadn 't protested to the Colonel.

There you are, Bud.

is that they put on the table at dinner.

753
00:49:51,760 --> 00:49:53,512
- What is it?
- Peanut butter.

754

''1 2 Forts can make a hell of a mess
of any gosh-darn target.''

768
00:50:31,040 --> 00:50:33,190
Apparently, with this new bombsight of theirs,

769
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,158
they can drop a bomb
into a barrel from 30,000 feet.

770
00:50:36,240 --> 00:50:37,798
Zonk!

Well, well.

- Ah, for Pete's sake!
- What's eating you , Joe boy?

775
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,470
Why do we have to be here all the time,
listening to what the RAF did last night?

776
00:50:53,560 --> 00:50:56,757
We've been here over two months now.
When are <i>we</i> going to get started?

777
00:50:56,840 --> 00:50:58,319
Soon enough, Friselli.

- Evening, Penrose.
- Good evening, sir.

780
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:12,474
First of all, Elsie, a nice large whisky and soda.

781
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:14,755
Sorry, Mr Palmer, we've run out of whisky.

- What? Again ?
- l'm afraid so, Mr Palmer.

783
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,270
We had some more Americans in last night.

784
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,753
Will you have beer?

785

Yes, Auntie.

He doesn 't seem to come down
as often as he used to, does he, dear?

792
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:54,553
No, Auntie.

793
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,914
Funny.

794
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,150

Devilish bad form, old boy.

Look, is this supposed to be a restaurant
or a funeral parlour? That's all l wanna know.

lt's kind of... lt's sort of a custom over here.

What? Like eating's a thing to be ashamed of?

We're just going to sit here till Christmas.

- Why?
- Appropriating him like that.

Most mothers don 't like it.

No. They think you're gonna poison them.

Going on four. We've got a boy, too.

865

George. He's six. You wouldn 't care to see
a snapshot of him, would you?

And then , this next one,
that's George and Emmy together.

batches, though, that's the trouble.

l haven 't seen you for...well, ages, it seems.

920
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:18,474
l know. We've been pretty busy up at the station .

921
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,915
l haven 't had much of a chance
to get down here.

922
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:24,076
- Well, what's your news?
-Nothing much.

923
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,628
Auntie's made another application
for my deferment.

924
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:30,679
She says she's trained me now in her illnesses
and if l leave her to join up, it'd be fatal.

925
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,193
l see. lt would. Absolutely.

926
00:57:32,280 --> 00:57:35,033
But l can stay on at the cottage hospital
as a part-time nurse.

927
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:36,792
- That's something, isn 't it?
- Yes.

928
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,356
- What's your news?
- <i>O</i>h, nothing much.

929
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,590
Just the usual sort of stooging, boring...

930
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:44,113
- <i>O</i>h, hello, Tiny.
- Hello.

931
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:46,350
Well...we ought to get cracking.

932
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:47,793
Good evening.

933
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,235
No, you wait here and l'll go and get the car.

934
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,350
ls there any chance of seeing you soon ?

935
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:58,796
Afraid not, you know.
We've got a basinful of stuff to get through.

936
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:00,313
Yes. l see.

937
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,152
lt's perfectly all right.

938
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,992
l just wondered...

939
00:58:09,520 --> 00:58:10,953
Look, l...

940
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,190
l know er...what you're thinking.

941
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,196
You're not right, you know.

942
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,713
Aren 't l?

943
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,552
l wish that l could explain it.

944
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:23,599
You don 't have to explain anything, Peter.
There's nothing to explain .

945
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,156
l'm terribly sorry.

946
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:29,752
lt's perfectly all right.

947
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:31,398
Goodbye, Peter.

948
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:39,114
How long do you think this blasted war
is going on for?

949
00:58:39,200 --> 00:58:41,953
<i>O</i>h, years and years and years, l should think.

950
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:44,474
Spring 1 950's my personal bet.

951
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:48,519
Do you think any of us have the right
to get ourselves tangled up until it's over?

952
00:58:48,600 --> 00:58:51,398
What do you mean , financially or emotionally?

953
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,630
Wives, children , things like that.

954
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:55,676
Why ask me, old man ?

955
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:57,990
Personally, l've never had the old urge.

956
00:58:58,080 --> 00:59:01,629
Why don 't you write to Auntie Thingumajig
in the Daily Whatsit?

957
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:03,472
l'm serious, you know.

958
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,078
l know you are.

959
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:08,310
And l know you're thinking about David.

960
00:59:08,400 --> 00:59:12,757
But l'm telling you the truth. lt's not a subject
that l'm qualified to give an opinion on .

961
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:15,274
But you could tell me
how you'd feel if you were...

962
00:59:15,360 --> 00:59:17,920
well, if you were in
the same sort of spot as l'm in .

963
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:19,956
l could, but it wouldn 't do any good.

964
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:23,510
You see, l'm on the ground and, any time now,
you may be on ops again .

965
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,956
Anything l said couldn 't have
any possible bearing on the matter.

966
00:59:44,760 --> 00:59:46,318
Good luck, Colonel.

967
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,958
Thanks. We'll need it.

968
00:59:54,480 --> 00:59:56,630
Well, guys, l guess this is it.

969
00:59:57,800 --> 00:59:59,756
Quite some moment, isn 't it?

970
00:59:59,840 --> 01:00:01,910
<i>Yeah but not for making a noise like a speech</i>

971
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:05,470
l didn 't even have a pep talk for the fellas.
They don 't need it.

972
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:09,917
You're all the lousiest crew any poor pilot
was ever stuck with and l love you .

973
01:00:10,000 --> 01:00:12,434
So, come on . Get up them stairs.

974
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:15,876
- Come on . Let's go, Joe.
J<i>O</i>E: <i>lm right behind you</i>

975
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,276
(Roar of aircraft)

976
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:02,753
- Fred. Another pint, please.
- Very good, sir.

977
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,030
- Ah, good. Here's the food.
- Here it is.

978
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,553
- Right, sir.
- Ta.

979
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,473
- Well, here's to Forts.
- Here's to Lancs. Cheerio, Nob.

980
01:01:13,560 --> 01:01:15,516
Some people get all the luck.

981
01:01:15,600 --> 01:01:18,558
- Where are you now?
- <i>O</i>ver at Tetworth Gunnery School, sir.

982
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:21,279
Can you imagine Nobby instructing? (Whistles)

983
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:25,478
- l'll bet he puts the wind up the pupils.
- The pupils put the wind up me, they're so good.

984
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,755
- Have you applied for Lancs?
- Hundreds of times.

985
01:01:27,840 --> 01:01:31,435
Have another crack at it. l'll pull a few strings
and try and get you with me again .

986
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:33,078
Now, that sounds a bit of all right.

987
01:01:33,160 --> 01:01:35,276
l've just heard a great story. This'll kill you .

988
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,670
There was an Englishman ,
an lrishman and a Scotsman travelling in a train .

989
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,234
Erm, please, could we have three beers?

990
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,072
- Yes, sir.
- Light ales.

991
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,390
- ..and when the man ...
- Excuse me, will you?

992
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,473
..came to collect the tickets, the Englishman
turned to the Scotsman and said...

993
01:01:50,560 --> 01:01:53,597
- What are you chaps drinking?
- Hello. Thanks. We've just ordered.

994
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:55,796
- Come on . Have another.
- Well, <i>O</i>k. Thanks.

995
01:01:55,880 --> 01:01:58,235
l guess we've got the right
to get plastered tonight.

996
01:01:58,320 --> 01:02:01,118
You have. From all accounts,
that was a grand job you did today.

997
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:03,953
We walked away from it.
That's the best that can be said for it.

998
01:02:04,040 --> 01:02:05,996
Here. Sit down . Sit down . Sit down .

999
01:02:06,080 --> 01:02:08,036
What are you having? The beer's good.

1000
01:02:08,120 --> 01:02:10,839
- This is beer, isn 't it?
- Well, it's a little ladylike.

1001
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:12,876
<i>O</i>k. We'll have what you got there.

1002
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,032
Four pints of dark, Thomas.
Chalk it up on the old slate.

1003
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,350
l'm going to have my cigarette now, dear.

1004
01:02:20,800 --> 01:02:24,918
<i>O</i>h. l must have left my lighter upstairs.
Run and get it for me, will you , dear?

1005
01:02:25,000 --> 01:02:26,353
Allow me.

1006
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:27,395
<i>O</i>h.

1007
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,393
Thank you .

1008
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:35,152
The pleasure is all mine.

1009
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:39,916
What charming manners.

1010
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,230
- Hello, fellas.
- Baby, there's your beaker.

1011
01:02:42,320 --> 01:02:46,313
Thanks a lot. Say, listen , Flight Lieutenant,
l guess l owe you a bit of an apology.

1012
01:02:46,400 --> 01:02:49,995
lf l gave you or anybody else the idea
that bombing targets was going to be easy,

1013
01:02:50,080 --> 01:02:52,036
l'll eat my words right here and now,

1014
01:02:52,120 --> 01:02:56,079
but l defy any other bombardier
to have done any better under those conditions.

1015
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:58,799
Funny thing,
that group ahead of us hit that target smacko.

1016
01:02:58,880 --> 01:03:00,632
You know, ''zonk, zonk, zonk''?

1017
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,075
- How wide were your berths?
- How wide would you like?

1018
01:03:03,160 --> 01:03:06,675
- We may have killed a couple of enemy cows.
- Enemy-occupied cows.

1019
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:10,275
Aw, lay off, fellas. l'll do better next time.
We live and learn .

1020
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,396
l sure hope we learn . We only just lived.

1021
01:03:12,480 --> 01:03:13,549
Focke-Wulfes?

1022
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:17,269
Yeah. They're good. Like you said they were.
Like some of us didn 't believe.

1023
01:03:17,360 --> 01:03:18,793
Here it is.

1024
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,438
<i>O</i>oh, biggies!

1025
01:03:20,520 --> 01:03:21,839
Thanking you .

1026
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,353
Well, good luck.

1027
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:25,112
- Thanks.
- Here's to you .

1028
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:29,996
l'm celebrating myself tonight.
l've been posted, Lancasters.

1029
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,513
- Flying again ?
- You bet.

1030
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:33,556
- Swell.
- You mean , ''good show old boy''.

1031
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:34,993
Congratulations.

1032
01:03:36,360 --> 01:03:38,920
..the ticket collector said, ''This man 's expired.''

1033
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,309
So, the lrishman said, ''But his ticket hasn 't.''

1034
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:43,993
Not bad, eh?

1035
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:46,719
Come to think of it. l know a better one than that.

1036
01:03:46,800 --> 01:03:48,153
Goebbels...

1037
01:03:48,240 --> 01:03:49,673
Captain ? Captain ?

1038
01:03:49,760 --> 01:03:52,320
- Goebbels said to Hitler...
- Excuse me, would you?

1039
01:03:52,400 --> 01:03:53,753
Er... Yeah.

1040
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:56,400
This'll make you laugh, this one. lt's a good one.

1041
01:03:56,480 --> 01:03:58,232
Goebbels said to Hitler...

1042
01:03:58,320 --> 01:04:00,072
Goebbels said to Gring...

1043
01:04:00,160 --> 01:04:01,718
No. Wait a minute.

1044
01:04:01,800 --> 01:04:03,552
Gring said to Goebbels...

1045
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,598
No. That's not right. Wait a minute.
lt's very funny, this one.

1046
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:08,993
- Hello!
J<i>O</i>HNNY: <i>O</i>h, hello.

1047
01:04:09,080 --> 01:04:11,275
- Care for a drink?
- We're already swimming in it.

1048
01:04:11,360 --> 01:04:14,113
- Wait a minute, Johnny. This is our night out.
- Joe says, yes.

1049
01:04:14,200 --> 01:04:17,112
That was a terrific show
you boys put up this morning.

1050
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:19,350
Yes, l'm sure l'm right. lt is. lt's G...

1051
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:22,159
Yes. That's right. lt's Gring said to Goebbels...

1052
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,634
- Hello, Nobby. ls he still at it?
- Yes.

1053
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:29,235
- Nobby Clarke, the worst air gunner in the RAF.
- How do you do?

1054
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:30,878
- How are you?
- Sit down , Nobby.

1055
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,269
You blokes put up a pretty good show
this afternoon .

1056
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:36,511
My story. l can 't remember the middle bit,
but the end was,

1057
01:04:36,600 --> 01:04:39,160
''Because the higher you go, the Fhrer.''

1058
01:04:39,240 --> 01:04:40,673
Not bad, eh?

1059
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:44,878
<i>O</i>oh, by the way, l hear you chaps did a good
job of work this afternoon . Congratulations.

1060

Well, would you believe you?

01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,636
Have a beer, Miss Winterton .

1068
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:36,036
Disgraceful.
What do they think this place is, a speakeasy?

1069
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,956
Mr Palmer. Mr Palmer!

1070
01:05:39,040 --> 01:05:40,996
<i>O</i>h, er...yes, Miss Winterton ?

1071
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:43,995
- Disgraceful, isn 't it?
- Yes, isn 't it?

1072
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:46,992
Well, don 't you think
you'd better do something about it?

1073
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,638
Right.

1074
01:05:58,080 --> 01:05:59,559
Boys, boys!

1075
01:05:59,640 --> 01:06:02,598
No, now, listen .
Break it up, break it up. Break it up.

1076
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:05,433
- l'll tell you why, Miss Winterton objects.
- <i>O</i>h?

1077
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,988
l think she feels like a little chamber music.

1078
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:12,476
So, er, what about giving her
one of the old ones, eh? Shall we?

1079
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,118
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1080
01:06:47,160 --> 01:06:49,390
- There you are, Miss Todd.
- Yes, Miss Winterton ?

1081
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:52,153
Now, you know l never complain ...
Go on up, dear.

1082
01:06:52,240 --> 01:06:55,710
You know l never complain ,
but this time, really, l mean to say.

1083
01:06:55,800 --> 01:06:57,313
- The singing.
- Singing!

1084
01:06:57,400 --> 01:07:00,233
Yes, l'm terribly sorry,
but it is nearly closing time.

1085
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:03,710
Closing time? They should all have been
thrown into the street an hour ago.

1086
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,678
l agree,
but l don 't think l'm quite strong enough to do it.

1087
01:07:06,760 --> 01:07:09,638
l assure you , Miss Winterton ,
l don 't approve of it.

1088
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:12,280
- Toddy, my angel!
- Peter! <i>O</i>h, Peter, really.

1089
01:07:12,360 --> 01:07:14,112
Good night, Miss Winterton .

1090
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:15,952
MEN : Good night, Miss Winterton .

1091
01:07:16,040 --> 01:07:18,679
- l'll be up in a minute. Toddy.
- Peter, what is it now?

1092
01:07:18,760 --> 01:07:22,594
These two gentlemen , very good friends of mine
both, Americans though they may be,

1093
01:07:22,680 --> 01:07:24,318
desire to cash a cheque.

1094
01:07:24,400 --> 01:07:27,597
<i>O</i>h, all right. You'll find blank cheque forms
on the desk in my office.

1095
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:29,636
<i>O</i>h, thanks so much.

1096
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:32,153
- Hey, Johnny.
- Yeah?

1097
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:35,312
- Did you see that? He actually kissed her.
- Come on , lug.

1098
01:07:35,400 --> 01:07:37,470
- l just want one word with you .
- Well?

1099
01:07:42,560 --> 01:07:45,791
Afraid l won 't see you after tonight,
not for a bit anyway.

1100
01:07:45,880 --> 01:07:50,431
<i>O</i>h, Peter, l'm sorry. At least...l'm glad for you .
lt's what you wanted, isn 't it?

1101
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:52,476
More than anything else, yes.

1102
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:56,198
lris will be terribly upset. Have you told her?

1103
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,196
Er, no, no, Toddy. l um...

1104
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:03,239
l was wondering whether you'd tell her for me,
after l've gone, you know.

1105
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:07,950
Just say it happened very suddenly and...
just say goodbye to her for me, would you?

1106
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:14,832
Peter, l know it's none of my business, but...
what exactly is wrong between you two?

1107
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:18,595
lt's nothing, Toddy, really. Nothing.
lt's just that er...

1108
01:08:18,680 --> 01:08:20,875
Look, l...l can 't possibly explain it.

1109
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:25,276
Let me just say goodbye to you , eh?

1110
01:08:27,560 --> 01:08:29,516
That's for you .

1111
01:08:30,680 --> 01:08:32,636
And that's for her.

1112
01:08:37,800 --> 01:08:39,756
And that's for her again .

1113
01:08:42,600 --> 01:08:46,434
Cheque forms, cheque forms, cheque forms -
there aren 't any cheque forms.

1114
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,350
''For Johnny''. Hey, what's this?

1115
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,038
- Johnny, look.
- Hm?

1116
01:08:54,120 --> 01:08:57,749
- The old girl's written you a poem.
- <i>O</i>h, put it away, Joe, it may be private.

1117
01:08:57,840 --> 01:09:01,310
Private! l'll say it's private.
She's put her flaming heart on paper.

1118
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:04,597
For Johnny.
''Do not despair for Johnny-head-in -air,

1119
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:06,955
He sleeps as sound as Johnny underground.''

1120
01:09:07,040 --> 01:09:10,510
- What the heck does that mean ? Any idea?
- Put it away.

1121
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:12,556
''Fetch out no shroud for Johnny...''

1122
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,676
Just looking for cheque forms, ma'am.

1123
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:17,672
lf you want to cash a cheque
to pay for your last round of drinks,

1124
01:09:17,760 --> 01:09:19,796
please don 't bother, have them on the house.

1125
01:09:19,880 --> 01:09:22,269
That's darn kind of you ,
but we couldn 't possibly...

1126
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:25,796
Please, l insist. lf you're very quick,
you've just time to order another.

1127
01:09:25,880 --> 01:09:29,031
Gee, that's swell of you , ma'am.
l could hug you for that.

1128
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:30,553
Er... (Clears throat)

1129
01:09:30,640 --> 01:09:32,073
Waiter.

1130
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,917
- Any more news from home?
-No, not since l last saw you .

1131
01:09:39,880 --> 01:09:41,552
Have you been reading this?

1132
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:46,234
Well...we were looking
for the blank cheque forms, you see,

1133
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:50,108
and Johnny happens to be my name, too,
and Joe...

1134
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:53,351
- And l'm sorry.
- That's all right.

1135
01:09:53,440 --> 01:09:55,396
Your name's Johnny, is it?

1136
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,436
Yes, it is. Johnny Hollis.

1137
01:09:58,920 --> 01:10:00,512
What did you think of this?

1138
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:02,636
l don 't know that l quite understood it.

1139
01:10:02,720 --> 01:10:04,950
l'm not much of an expert on poetry, l guess.

1140
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:06,314
Nor me.

1141
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:08,356
<i>O</i>h? We thought you'd written it.

1142
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:11,032
<i>O</i>h, no.

1143
01:10:11,120 --> 01:10:13,076
No, my husband wrote it.

1144
01:10:14,120 --> 01:10:16,156
Now, why on earth should l tell you that?

1145
01:10:16,240 --> 01:10:18,754
You're the only person , beside myself,
who knows.

1146
01:10:18,840 --> 01:10:21,195
- Now, why should l tell you?
- l don 't know.

1147
01:10:21,280 --> 01:10:23,236
Perhaps it's just the names.

1148
01:10:23,320 --> 01:10:25,276
Yes...perhaps it is.

1149
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:28,830
But...it makes me feel kind of...privileged.

1150
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,876
l'm glad.

1151
01:10:32,280 --> 01:10:34,236
- Johnny.
- Hm?

1152
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,198
- You're not superstitious, are you?
-No, not me.

1153
01:10:37,280 --> 01:10:40,875
lf it happens, it happens,
no matter how many ladders you walk under.

1154
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,111
My husband used this lighter
as a sort of St Christopher.

1155
01:10:44,200 --> 01:10:46,270
He was miserable if he flew without it.

1156
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,840
He flew without it the day he was killed.

1157
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:54,118
lf he knew he didn 't have it,
he was probably worried.

1158
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:58,512
And if you're worried when you're flying...
well, things can happen .

1159
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:02,876
lf l give it to you , you won 't feel that way about it,
will you?

1160
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:04,916
No, l don 't use lucky charms.

1161
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,956
l'd sure like to have it though.

1162
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:11,397
- lt doesn 't work very well as a lighter, l'm afraid.
- <i>O</i>h, l can probably fix it.

1163
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,436
Anyway, it's...

1164
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,317
it's a good thing to have.

1165
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:17,918
Thanks an awful lot.

1166
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:21,231
- <i>O</i>h, and, Johnny...
- Yes...er... Yes?

1167
01:11:21,320 --> 01:11:24,471
No, l'm not going to tell you my Christian name
because...

1168
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:26,232
Well, just because.

1169
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:28,993
But people, some people anyway,
call me Toddy.

1170
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:30,911
Yes...Toddy?

1171
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:33,560
lf you ever feel you want
to get away from the camp,

1172
01:11:33,640 --> 01:11:37,349
and you don 't want to face the crowd in there,
come in here and talk to me.

1173
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:39,590
l'd like to hear some more about your family.

1174
01:11:39,680 --> 01:11:42,831
Say, you don 't know
what you're letting yourself in for.

1175
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,992
When l get going about my family,
l don 't stop for a long time.

1176
01:11:46,080 --> 01:11:48,036
<i>O</i>h, good.

1177
01:11:48,120 --> 01:11:52,716
<i>O</i>h, Lord, look at the time. lf l don 't get
these boys out of here, l'll have the police in .

1178
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,756
(Men laughing and chatting)

1179
01:12:25,720 --> 01:12:27,915
Mr Palmer, l'm ashamed of you .

1180
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,956
l'm terribly sorry.

1181
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,949
Gentlemen , l call for three cheers
for our popular hostess Miss Todd, our Toddy.

1182
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:37,950
Hip, hip...

1183
01:12:38,040 --> 01:12:39,268
Hooray!

1184
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:40,918
- <i>Hip hip</i>
- Hooray!

1185
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:41,830
<i>Hip hip</i>

1186
01:12:41,920 --> 01:12:43,797
ALL: <i>Hooray!</i>

1187
01:12:43,880 --> 01:12:46,314
- Speech! Come on , speech.
- Speech, come on !

1188
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:49,472
Thank you , gentlemen ,
and welcome to our American allies.

1189
01:12:49,560 --> 01:12:51,630
And will you please get the hell out of here?

1190
01:12:54,200 --> 01:12:55,758
- Good night.
- Good night, Toddy.

1191
01:12:55,840 --> 01:12:57,990
- Good night, pheasant.
- Good night, Captain .

1192
01:12:58,080 --> 01:12:59,593
Good night. Good night.

1193
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,114
Good night.
And about those drinks - thanks a lot.

1194
01:13:02,200 --> 01:13:04,156
Good night. Good night, Peter.

1195
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:06,196
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

1196
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,872
Good night.

1197
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,712
- Good night.
- Good night, Johnny.

1198
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:11,199
And thanks - really thanks.

1199
01:13:11,280 --> 01:13:12,872
- Good night.
- Good night, Toddy.

1200
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:14,916
Good night. Good night.

1201
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,709
AlRMAN : All out. End of the line.
SEC<i>O</i>ND AlRMAN : Visual target, couldn 't miss.

1202
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:45,392
AlRMAN : Where were the Focke Wulf?

1203
01:13:48,680 --> 01:13:50,910
That's one target we won 't have to hit again .

1204
01:13:51,000 --> 01:13:53,309
You'd think they'd defend a target like Frankfurt.

1205
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,358
lt's different from the last time
we went to Frankfurt, remember?

1206
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:58,078
- Gosh, don 't l just.
- Hello, lrene.

1207
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:01,914
Thanks. First time they used those rockets
on us. Never been more scared in my life.

1208
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:05,675
You were scared? Did you hear a noise
like a machine gun coming from the copilot?

1209
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:07,990
- lt was my teeth rattling.
- <i>Johnny</i>

1210
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:09,559
<i>Sir</i>

1211
01:14:09,640 --> 01:14:11,198
- <i>O</i>h, Bill, mail in ?
- Yes, sir.

1212
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,999
- Anything for me?
- l checked, but there's nothing for you .

1213
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:15,638
<i>O</i>k. Thanks.

1214
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:20,552
No dice, eh?

1215
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:22,232
No dice.

1216
01:14:22,320 --> 01:14:26,552
l expected something today, too.
Haven 't heard for quite a while as it happens.

1217
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:29,108
- Nothing wrong, l hope.
-No, sir. Thank you , sir.

1218
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:32,317
Anyway, l wouldn 't worry too much about it
cos in a week or so's time,

1219
01:14:32,400 --> 01:14:35,392
you'll have the opportunity
to find out how Emmy is for yourself.

1220
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:40,672
- You mean ...l'm going home?
- Yeah, that's right.

1221

ow come ?

1223
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:49,429
Seems they need more instructors back home
with combat experience.

1224
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:51,670
l've been asked to recommend a combat pilot

1225
01:14:51,760 --> 01:14:56,390
capable of taking charge of a special instructors'
course, majority goes with it.

1226
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,630
So l thought l'd send the best man l'd got.

1227
01:14:58,720 --> 01:15:01,951
Gosh, l...l...l don 't know what to say.

1228
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:05,635
l'm going to hate losing you ,
especially now when things are hotting up.

1229
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,312
Yeah, l know.

1230
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:09,356
ln a way, l'll hate going, too.

1231
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,396
But...home.

1232
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:14,513
Play ball!

1233
01:15:14,600 --> 01:15:16,511
ALL CHANT: Ra, ra, ra, ra.

1234
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,113
(Cheering)

1235
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:20,555
Hey, look, get Tiny running at the pitcher.

1236
01:15:21,920 --> 01:15:24,480
<i>O</i>f course,
you don 't run towards the bowler in this game.

1237
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,198

What are you doing this evening?

1241
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:36,510
- Just taking lris to the station dance.
- Ah.

1242
01:15:36,600 --> 01:15:40,388
l suppose she'll turn out to be in love
with some Englishman , like all the rest.

1243
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:42,755
- Listen , l gotta tell you ...
(Cheering)

1244
01:15:45,120 --> 01:15:46,189
Hey!

01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,430
Hey, bring the bat back!

1246
01:15:48,520 --> 01:15:51,034
Come on , bring the bat back.

1247
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:55,072
- Listen , Joe.

1248
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:59,312
l...l've got to...call on the vicar.
l'll come into town with you .

1249
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:00,958
- <i>O</i>n the vicar?
- Yeah.

1250
01:16:01,040 --> 01:16:03,998
- Why?
- lt's the children 's party they're giving tomorrow.

1251
01:16:04,080 --> 01:16:06,594
For some weird reason ,
they've put it all off on me.

1252
01:16:06,680 --> 01:16:09,399
Well, do you wonder
after that performance last time?

1253
01:16:09,480 --> 01:16:12,358
- (As child) Uncle Johnny.
- (As Uncle Johnny ) Yeah, that's me.

1254
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:15,034
How about that story
about the flying hippopotamus?

1255
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,635
- How do you dream things like that up?
- All right. kids like that sorta...

1256
01:16:18,720 --> 01:16:20,472
- Joe.
- What?

1257
01:16:20,560 --> 01:16:22,152
- l gotta tell you .
- Tell me what?

1258
01:16:22,240 --> 01:16:25,118
- Don 't tell the others, now.
- l'm not going to. What?

1259
01:16:25,200 --> 01:16:27,156
They're sending me home.

1260
01:16:27,240 --> 01:16:29,595
- Johnny, no.
- Yeah.

1261
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:31,636
(Cheering and shouting)

1262
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:34,678
- Safe.
- What do you mean ''safe''? l've ruined myself.

1263
01:16:40,040 --> 01:16:41,996
Peter, who was it who sprouted wings?

1264
01:16:42,080 --> 01:16:44,036
A pottamus.

1265
01:16:44,120 --> 01:16:46,873
The pottamus sprouted wings, that's quite right.

1266
01:16:46,960 --> 01:16:51,476
He looked down , you see, and suddenly
there he'd gone and sprouted 'em.

1267
01:16:52,600 --> 01:16:53,635
Yep.

1268
01:16:53,720 --> 01:16:55,950
Pottamus don 't have wings.

1269
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,309
Great big ones, too. Wingspan 200ft.

1270
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:02,834
Where'd the pottamus fly to?

1271
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:06,833
Well, it was a nice bright day,
so he flew towards the sun .

1272
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:13,309
- That's very naughty.
- l know, that's what l told him. Naughty.

1273
01:17:13,400 --> 01:17:15,709
- You're an evil influence.
(Peter giggles)

1274
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:19,270
l think perhaps we'd better put the candy away
in a safe place,

1275
01:17:19,360 --> 01:17:22,716
otherwise we shall have them all eaten
before tomorrow afternoon .

1276
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,358
Yes.

1277
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,432
You know, lris, l've been thinking.

1278
01:18:57,520 --> 01:19:00,318
Why don 't you leave the old sourpuss
to stew in her own juice?

1279
01:19:00,400 --> 01:19:02,038
<i>O</i>h, l couldn 't do that.

1280
01:19:02,120 --> 01:19:04,998
After all, l do owe her a lot...in a way.

1281
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:07,833
<i>O</i>h, look, you don 't owe her a thing
and you know it.

1282
01:19:07,920 --> 01:19:10,036
Looks to me as if things are the other way round.

1283
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:13,317
She's just a selfish old gorgon
who thinks of nothing but her stomach.

1284
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,550
Don 't let's talk about her. Do you mind?

1285
01:19:15,640 --> 01:19:17,710
<i>O</i>k, let's talk about you .

1286
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:22,874
Er...l wonder if you'd mind if l asked you
a question , kind of personal.

1287
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:24,996
- A truth game?
- Yeah, that's right.

1288
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:30,353
l've er...l've been wondering
if there was any particular...

1289
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:36,074
Well, if there was any one guy you er...

1290
01:19:37,400 --> 01:19:39,550
- You know what l mean , don 't you?
- l do.

1291
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,516
And the answer is no.

1292
01:19:42,600 --> 01:19:44,955
- No-one at all?
-No-one at all.

1293
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,910
Not er...not even an Englishman ?

1294
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:49,956
Not even an Englishman .

1295
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,952
That's all better.

1296
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:56,391

1297

- Hello, gang.

Say, what's the flare path lit up for?

1299
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:06,068

- What's the matter?

1361
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:33,239
Say, is there any way of
breaking into the schoolroom?

1362
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:36,676
- Well, we might. Why?
- lt's something l forgot to fix for tomorrow.

1363
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:39,991
<i>O</i>ne of my conjuring tricks.
<i>O</i>ld Black Magic, they call me.

1364
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:42,036
<i>O</i>h, come on , then .

1365
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,475
- lf we get arrested, it's your fault.
- <i>O</i>k.

1366
01:23:47,480 --> 01:23:50,916
l wish we could have a little more light
on the scene. l think it's gonna show.

1367
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:55,118
l'm afraid you'll have to risk it, Johnny.
lt'll take hours to black out all the windows.

1368
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:57,156
Yeah, you're right.

1369
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:59,196
<i>O</i>k, we'll risk it.

1370
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,236
- Thank you , Miss Todd.
-Not at all.

1371
01:24:04,400 --> 01:24:08,188
Say...the village looks quite different
in the moonlight.

1372
01:24:10,240 --> 01:24:13,198
The old Lion looks positively romantic,
doesn 't it?

1373
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:16,828
There's a very bad blackout in No.3 bathroom.

1374
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:18,876
You ain 't got no soul.

1375
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:22,589
- (Laughs softly ) l've seen moonlight before.
- l know.

1376
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,636
- Toddy.
- Uh-huh?

1377
01:24:25,720 --> 01:24:28,871
l hate goodbyes,
so l've been putting off telling you ...

1378
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:31,831
..but l'm going home.

1379
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:34,556
<i>O</i>h, Johnny, how marvellous for you .

1380
01:24:34,640 --> 01:24:36,358
l'm so glad.

1381
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:39,432
- You can imagine what l felt when l heard.
- Yes, indeed.

1382
01:24:40,440 --> 01:24:43,273
- How wonderful for Mary to have you back.
- Yes.

1383
01:24:43,360 --> 01:24:45,430
l guess she'll be pleased, all right.

1384
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:48,034
After the war,
maybe you could come out to the States.

1385
01:24:48,120 --> 01:24:50,634
<i>O</i>h...well, we'll try.

1386
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,676
l don 't suppose it'll be very easy.

1387
01:24:54,200 --> 01:24:56,555
Then we'll come over here and visit with you .

1388
01:24:56,640 --> 01:25:01,316
Golly, it'd be swell to come over here
to your Golden Lion just as ordinary tourists.

1389
01:25:01,400 --> 01:25:04,312
Sit around there all day - talking, drinking.

1390
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:07,152
Not to have to fly.

1391
01:25:07,240 --> 01:25:09,196
Don 't you like flying, Johnny?

1392
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:11,876
<i>O</i>h, sure l do.

1393
01:25:11,960 --> 01:25:14,315
But in my own time and not the government's.

1394
01:25:15,600 --> 01:25:18,114
Well...just in case.

1395
01:25:19,160 --> 01:25:21,116
Here's wishing you all the best.

1396
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,430
- All the best, Johnny.
- You deserve it.

1397
01:25:23,520 --> 01:25:25,476
Give my love to Mary.

1398
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:27,516
l will.

1399
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:34,516
(Whistles)

1400
01:25:40,400 --> 01:25:43,358
Thank you . And thank you for a lovely evening.

1401
01:25:43,440 --> 01:25:45,396
<i>O</i>h, no, thank <i>you</i> .

1402
01:25:50,280 --> 01:25:53,670
- l shall see you again , shan 't l?
- <i>O</i>h, sure. kids' party.

1403
01:25:53,760 --> 01:25:55,318
<i>O</i>f course.

1404
01:25:55,400 --> 01:25:57,960
And l'll be down to say goodbye, too...if l can .

1405
01:25:59,200 --> 01:26:01,760
- Then this is just good night.
- That's right.

1406
01:26:01,840 --> 01:26:04,308
lt's just good night...Toddy.

1407
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,756
Good night, Johnny. Thank you .

1408
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,436
<i>O</i>h...what for?

1409
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:17,436
Lots of things.

1410
01:26:29,880 --> 01:26:32,348
- How are you , Johnny boy?
- l don 't know yet.

1411
01:26:32,440 --> 01:26:36,399
Well, get a good hope, Minnie -
here we go again .

1412
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:51,196
Hm? <i>O</i>h! Sir.

1413
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:53,236
Good morning, Johnny. All set?

1414
01:26:53,320 --> 01:26:55,276
Well, getting set, sir.

1415
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:57,715
Guess l'm just a bit out of uniform
at the moment.

1416
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,796
- Say, sir...
- Hm?

1417
01:27:02,840 --> 01:27:05,638
Er...about that question of going home.

1418
01:27:05,720 --> 01:27:07,676
What about it?

1419
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,718
Well, l was just wondering
if you couldn 't see your way clear

1420
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:12,756
to putting some other guy's name in .

1421
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:15,115
Sure l could, easily, but what's the idea?

1422
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,310
<i>O</i>h...l don 't know as l'd be all that much good
as an instructor.

1423
01:27:19,400 --> 01:27:21,356
Sure you would, Johnny.

1424
01:27:22,080 --> 01:27:23,718
What's the real reason ?

1425
01:27:23,800 --> 01:27:26,075
l don 't know as there is a real reason , sir.

1426
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:28,435
But the crew's only got ten more missions.

1427
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:32,794
We're kind of accustomed to being together.

1428
01:27:32,880 --> 01:27:36,953
And last night l got talking
with some of the RAF fellas in the mess...

1429
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:43,074
..and it occurred to me that if a guy
didn 't get here until the middle of things...

1430
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:47,635
..maybe he kind of oughta stick around
until the end.

1431
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:50,473
<i>O</i>h, it'll take much too long
to explain to you now.

1432
01:27:50,560 --> 01:27:53,711
Look, sir, l'll come in and see you
after the mission , hm?

1433
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:56,952
Yeah, sure.

1434
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:59,076
You can see me any time, you know that.

1435
01:27:59,920 --> 01:28:02,480
- You don 't have to, but come anyway.
- Thanks.

1436
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:06,189
- Hey, Johnny, l'll give you a hand with that.
- <i>O</i>h, thanking you .

1437
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:11,559
And me thinking at last we had the opportunity
to get ourselves a good pilot.

1438
01:28:11,640 --> 01:28:15,269
Yeah. You'll have to put up
with them bad landings just a little bit longer.

1439
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:17,590
Bad landings? What about them takeoffs?

1440
01:28:17,680 --> 01:28:19,716
Since when did l ever do a bad takeoff?

1441
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:23,759
Well, you usually manage to miss
the control tower, l'll give you that.

1442
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:27,957
Yeah. l suppose you think l'm a fool, hm?

1443
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:30,352
Sure l do.

1444
01:28:30,440 --> 01:28:34,638
<i>O</i>nly...well, we got kinda used to your flying now,
Johnny,

1445
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:38,713
and...l guess a good landing
would kinda throw us off.

1446
01:28:42,200 --> 01:28:44,270
- What are you throwing for?
- Double deuce.

1447
01:28:44,360 --> 01:28:47,591
- Double deuce! Here, let me try, will you?
- <i>O</i>k.

1448
01:28:47,680 --> 01:28:50,478
Here. Let's see if our luck's in , huh?

1449
01:28:50,560 --> 01:28:52,516
Double deuce - the target for today.

1450
01:28:52,600 --> 01:28:54,670
Smacko! Right on the...

1451
01:28:54,760 --> 01:28:56,990
Smacko, right on the target all right.

1452
01:28:58,040 --> 01:28:59,996
l oughta autograph this miss.

1453
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:06,196
Johnny.

1454
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:09,836
His mark. Let's go.

1455
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:32,194
What a charming boy that American is.
Charming.

1456
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:34,510
- l must say, you're a very lucky girl.
- Yes.

1457
01:29:34,600 --> 01:29:36,955
He's asked us both to dinner tonight, hasn 't he?

1458
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:40,555
- Did he say what time he was coming?
- l don 't think he'll be coming at all.

1459
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:44,110
- <i>O</i>h, why ever not?
- l told him a lie and he found out.

1460
01:29:44,200 --> 01:29:49,228
You know, lris, l don 't want to be unkind, but
l despair sometimes of being able to help you .

1461
01:29:49,320 --> 01:29:52,039
l took a lot of trouble
to become friends with that boy.

1462
01:29:52,120 --> 01:29:56,432
And just by using the ordinary little ways
of politeness and charm, if you wish,

1463
01:29:56,520 --> 01:29:58,272
l get him to like me very much indeed.

1464
01:29:58,360 --> 01:30:01,989
So much that he called you a selfish old gorgon
who thinks only of her stomach.

1465
01:30:02,080 --> 01:30:04,833
<i>Said it l had any sense</i>
<i>ld leave you to stew in your own juice</i>

1466
01:30:04,920 --> 01:30:07,229
And what's more,
l agreed with every word he said.

1467
01:30:07,320 --> 01:30:10,392
- lris, how dare you?
- l said l wouldn 't leave, l owed you something.

1468
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:12,391
l should say you <i>do</i> owe me something.

1469
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:14,835
No, l did owe you something. l don 't any longer.

1470
01:30:14,920 --> 01:30:17,992
Whatever l owed you ,
l don 't think it was as much as you said it was.

1471
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:22,278
And it's been paid back a hundred times over.
l'm going to leave you and l'm going to get a job.

1472
01:30:22,360 --> 01:30:25,033
l'm never coming back as long as l live.
Goodbye.

1473
01:30:25,120 --> 01:30:27,076
Well, really.

1474
01:30:29,120 --> 01:30:31,588
What exactly is a gorgon ?
Do you know, Miss W?

1475
01:30:31,680 --> 01:30:35,434
l'll thank you to keep your impertinence
for your bar cronies, Mr P.

1476
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:39,396
(Chuckles)

1477
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:43,396
lris. lris!

1478
01:30:43,480 --> 01:30:45,436
Miss Todd, lris has gone off her head.

1479
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:47,670
- She says she's going to leave me.
- Good.

1480
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,716
- What did you say?
- l said <i>good</i>.

1481
01:30:49,800 --> 01:30:52,439
- That settles it. l shall leave myself.
- Good.

1482
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:56,195
- Have you gone off your head, too?
- lt may interest you to know, Miss Winterton ,

1483
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:59,716
you've only been tolerated in this hotel
for so long because of lris.

1484
01:30:59,800 --> 01:31:03,190
As l seemed to be her only friend in the world,
l thought if l threw you out -

1485
01:31:03,280 --> 01:31:07,239
which, heaven knows, you've richly deserved
time and again in the last six years -

1486
01:31:07,320 --> 01:31:09,709
lris would be in a worse position
than she is now.

1487
01:31:09,800 --> 01:31:12,837
<i>O</i>r rather was, until she had the sense
to walk out and leave you flat.

1488
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:15,912
- How d...
- l will make out your bill at once, Miss Winterton .

1489
01:31:16,000 --> 01:31:19,549
And l may say nothing l have done for years
will give me greater satisfaction .

1490
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,108
Morning, Miss Winterton , how's everything?

1491
01:31:22,200 --> 01:31:23,952
<i>O</i>h, go to the devil.

1492
01:31:24,040 --> 01:31:25,393
- <i>Peter !</i>
- Hello, Toddy.

1493
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:26,913
Come into my office, quickly.

1494
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,958
- What's the matter with the old trout?
- How long have you got here?

1495
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:35,871
l don 't know what good fairy brought you here,
but it's providential.

1496
01:31:35,960 --> 01:31:38,110
You've got half a minute to make a big decision .

1497
01:31:38,200 --> 01:31:41,431
lris is leaving.
Now, do you or don 't you want to marry her?

1498
01:31:42,760 --> 01:31:44,876
Er...well, er...

1499
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:49,356
..Toddy, you see, it's all very difficult, you see...

1500
01:31:49,440 --> 01:31:52,512
- Let me do the talking. Do you mind?
- l've thought about it a lot...

1501
01:31:52,600 --> 01:31:55,672
l've known for a long time
what's been the trouble between you two.

1502
01:31:55,760 --> 01:32:00,197
The thing that's been holding you back has been
the thought of David and me, isn 't that right?

1503
01:32:00,280 --> 01:32:04,034
l shouldn 't have told you this
in a hundred years. That's about it, yes.

1504
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:06,588
Peter, believe me, you're wrong, dead wrong.

1505
01:32:09,400 --> 01:32:12,631
- Are you sure, Toddy?
- l wouldn 't lie to you about a thing like this.

1506
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:17,111
l promise you , if l could go back five years
and choose again whether or not to meet David,

1507
01:32:17,200 --> 01:32:20,237
whether or not to fall in love,
to marry him and bear his child,

1508
01:32:20,320 --> 01:32:24,313
l'd choose again to have things happen
exactly the way they did before, no other way.

1509
01:32:24,400 --> 01:32:27,870
- l can 't understand...
- There isn 't anything to understand.

1510
01:32:27,960 --> 01:32:32,112
l can 't explain it, but any other woman
in the world would tell you the same.

1511
01:32:32,200 --> 01:32:34,156
Look, there she is now. Go on .

1512
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:38,431
lris...look er, could you ...
Have you got a minute to...

1513
01:32:40,600 --> 01:32:43,956
- Peter! You haven 't let her go?
- Toddy, l couldn 't stop her.

1514
01:32:44,040 --> 01:32:49,034
Go after her. Tell her she's to stay as my guest
until she gets a job, tell her the gorgon 's gone,

1515
01:32:49,120 --> 01:32:50,473
- and tell her...
- What?

1516
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,120
Well, tell her you love her
and then see what happens.

1517
01:32:55,240 --> 01:32:57,196
To the station and please hurry.

1518
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:02,514
Please, l've got something l must say to you .

1519
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:05,034
- Well?
- Well...you see...er...

1520
01:33:05,760 --> 01:33:08,479
Look, a squadron leader's pay is 29 bob a day.

1521
01:33:08,560 --> 01:33:09,879
- ls it really?
- Yes.

1522
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:14,033
And then with allowances and a bit of fiddling,
you can get it up to 31 s/3d.

1523
01:33:14,120 --> 01:33:15,758
- Really?
- <i>O</i>h, yes, yes.

1524
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,389
Then if you slip in a marriage allowance,
of course, that's different.

1525
01:33:19,480 --> 01:33:21,948
That's about 49s/9d a day.

1526
01:33:23,720 --> 01:33:28,475
That's what l was trying to suggest.
l mean , to ask you if...if...if...

1527
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,310
- What are you trying to ask me?
- Well...

1528
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:38,195
Look, it hasn 't altogether been my fault.
l've been confused and muddled about things,

1529
01:33:38,280 --> 01:33:42,068
but my feelings haven 't changed a bit
in the last four years, not an atom.

1530
01:33:42,160 --> 01:33:44,720
- And l wondered if you could...
- What, Peter?

1531
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:48,070
Well, if you could take on 49s/9d a day.

1532
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,956
(Whistles softly )

1533
01:34:01,720 --> 01:34:03,995
- Tiny... <i>O</i>h, good afternoon , sir.
- Afternoon .

1534
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:06,913
- Come outside a minute, will you?
- Yes. Excuse me.

1535
01:34:09,440 --> 01:34:11,396
Well, congratulate me.

1536
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:13,436
- Why?
- Don 't l look any different?

1537
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,476
- No.
- l'm engaged to be married.

1538
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:17,312
- Who to?
- l'll give you one guess.

1539
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,960
- And about time too.
- Tiny, l want you to be best man .

1540
01:34:20,040 --> 01:34:22,713
l'd have murdered you if you hadn 't.
This calls for a party.

1541
01:34:22,800 --> 01:34:25,633
You bet. Got any money?
We'll get Johnny and some station chaps.

1542
01:34:25,720 --> 01:34:29,156
- And some of those of those types from 720.
- Are they back from the Med?

1543
01:34:29,240 --> 01:34:32,710
Didn 't you know? They're at Marston now.
<i>O</i>ld Prune's the flight commander.

1544
01:34:32,800 --> 01:34:35,075
Prune? Good Lord. <i>O</i>ld Hitler's really had it now.

1545
01:34:35,960 --> 01:34:37,916
Well, here they are.

1547
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:46,796

1551
01:35:17,600 --> 01:35:19,556
He's flying on three engines.

1552
01:35:25,080 --> 01:35:28,789
Sir, B Baker reports one engine cut,
rudder half shot away.

1553
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:32,156

and one 500lb bomb stuck in bomb bay.

1554
01:35:32,240 --> 01:35:34,310
Bomb bay door won 't close. Any advice?

1555
01:35:36,720 --> 01:35:38,039
Hello, Johnny.

1556
01:35:38,120 --> 01:35:41,192
Suggest you make a heading of 1-6-5.

1557
01:35:41,280 --> 01:35:43,635
1-6-5...

1559
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,079

The controls were not set to required course.

- Right.

(Shouting and screaming)

1578
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:34,035
Do you mind coming to the platform with me?

1579
01:37:39,720 --> 01:37:41,915
Children , ladies and gentlemen ...

1580
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,433
(Shouting continues)

1581
01:37:43,520 --> 01:37:45,954
(knocks on table) Children !

1582
01:37:48,720 --> 01:37:55,193
Now, at this stage of the proceedings, l had
hoped to introduce to you Captain John Hollis.

1583
01:37:55,280 --> 01:37:57,350
CHlLDREN : <i>Uncle Johnny!</i>

1584
01:37:57,440 --> 01:37:59,715
<i>Uncle Johnny!</i>

1585
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:05,875
Exactly. But, unfortunately, it appears that
he is prevented from coming here this afternoon .

1586
01:38:05,960 --> 01:38:07,951
That is so, isn 't it?

1587
01:38:08,040 --> 01:38:09,268
Yes, that's right.

1588
01:38:09,360 --> 01:38:12,397
CHlLDREN : We want Uncle Johnny!

1589
01:38:12,480 --> 01:38:16,519
Yes, yes, l know, children . But you
must remember that he's probably on duty

1590
01:38:16,600 --> 01:38:20,513
and that there are more important things
in the world than entertaining you .

1591
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:25,833
However, l've been asked to introduce to you
Lieutenant Joseph...

1592
01:38:27,160 --> 01:38:31,631
- (Whispers) Friselli.
- ..Friselli, who will speak to you in his stead.

1593
01:38:31,720 --> 01:38:33,676
Er...Lieutenant Friselli.

1594
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,716
(Children chatter)

1595
01:38:36,760 --> 01:38:41,754
l'm afraid l can 't tell you any stories, kids,
because...well, l just don 't know any.

1596
01:38:41,840 --> 01:38:46,595
At least, l can remember the Three Bears, but
l guess you've all heard that one already, huh?

1597
01:38:46,680 --> 01:38:50,150
l just wanna say that on behalf of everyone
at Halfpenny Field,

1598
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:54,995
it gives us all an awful big kick to see you
having such a good time here this afternoon .

1599
01:38:56,280 --> 01:38:59,750
And l only wish Johnny Hollis
could have gotten along to see it,

1600
01:38:59,840 --> 01:39:02,479
cos l know it would have given him
a big kick, too.

1601
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:07,475
But er, like the vicar told you ,
he...he couldn 't quite make it.

1602
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:14,431
l...l guess you'd better start
playing those games of yours.

1603
01:39:20,360 --> 01:39:23,158
Are you friends with Uncle Johnny?

1604
01:39:23,240 --> 01:39:24,753
That's right.

1605
01:39:24,840 --> 01:39:28,958
What happened when the hippopotamus
flew into the sun ?

1606
01:39:29,680 --> 01:39:31,557
l don 't know, kid, he didn 't tell me.

1607
01:39:32,640 --> 01:39:34,995
Peter, you run away and play.

1608
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:41,239
l heard what happened. l'm terribly sorry.

1609
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:44,993
Thanks.

1610
01:39:45,080 --> 01:39:47,514
l, er...l didn 't tell the vicar because l...

1611
01:39:49,680 --> 01:39:51,716
Well, l didn 't want to spoil all this.

1612
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:56,396
l knew Johnny pretty well.

1613
01:39:57,240 --> 01:39:59,196
Yes, l know.

1614
01:40:00,040 --> 01:40:05,398
l know there's nothing l can say can make things
any better for you , but...l can only tell you this:

1615
01:40:05,480 --> 01:40:08,438
as long as this town lasts,
he'll be remembered here.

1616
01:40:10,960 --> 01:40:12,916
l'd like you to read this.

1617
01:40:14,600 --> 01:40:16,556
Not now, later.

1618
01:40:16,640 --> 01:40:18,596
lt might help.

1619
01:40:42,520 --> 01:40:44,590
Time, please, gentlemen . Time, please.

1620
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:49,751
- Time, please, gentlemen . Time, please.

Why not come to Chicago?
Say, you can fly over in a few hours.

1627
01:41:06,120 --> 01:41:08,156
- What about all these gangsters?
- Aw, heck.
