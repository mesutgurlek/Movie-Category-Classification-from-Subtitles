1
00:00:25,483 --> 00:00:26,483
Heinrich

2
00:01:02,926 --> 00:01:09,044
Toyland

3
00:01:11,745 --> 00:01:13,226
They are still practicing.  

4
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:30,049
Don't you think they are getting better every day?
Yes, very good.

5
00:01:33,974 --> 00:01:37,087
I'd give everything so he can play his whole life like that.

6
00:01:39,967 --> 00:01:43,303
Probably tomorrow...

7
00:01:02,926 --> 00:01:47,474
Quiet now above!
Stop that plink-plonk, jew scum!

8
00:01:51,098 --> 00:01:54,324
You played very nice today. Very, very nice.

9
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,586
You won't catch me!

10
00:01:58,947 --> 00:02:00,602
Hey, these are my notes.
Stay here.

11
00:02:05,957 --> 00:02:06,888
Did you see my son?
N..

12
00:02:07,424 --> 00:02:10,549
Why in a hurry, beautiful lady?
I can't find him.

13
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:15,531
There was nothing goin on here.
The Silbersteins left today.

14
00:02:15,531 --> 00:02:17,580
Yeah, it's better for Heinrich.
And the bear?

15
00:02:21,917 --> 00:02:24,836
Why was Mrs Silberstein so sad?

16
00:02:25,613 --> 00:02:28,062
Because the Silbersteins have to travel soon.

17
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:30,146
Travel? Whereto?

18
00:02:32,909 --> 00:02:33,791
To Toyland.

19
00:01:51,098 --> 00:02:36,796
To Toyland? I want to go there too!

20
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:38,998
That's not possible, boy.

21
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:41,706
But i want to go to Toyland.

22
00:02:42,274 --> 00:02:44,296
i sad No. Now eat.

23
00:02:44,605 --> 00:02:46,555
Dad would have allowed it.

24
00:02:57,276 --> 00:02:59,726
Hello, did you see a little, six years old boy?

25
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:01,897
Do you think i can keep the whole crowd apart?

26
00:03:01,897 --> 00:03:02,852
But he is my son..

27
00:01:51,098 --> 00:03:05,280
Jew?

28
00:03:08,728 --> 00:03:13,569
So don't worry, madam.
We only brought jews to the station.

29
00:01:51,098 --> 00:03:15,456
Have a nice day!

30
00:03:26,096 --> 00:03:26,693
Heinrich?

31
00:03:41,328 --> 00:03:45,678
Could you..

32
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:48,405
..keep a secret?

33
00:03:53,768 --> 00:04:00,605
Downstairs in the corner,
i bumped into a rhinoceros.

34
00:01:51,098 --> 00:04:03,374
With a real rhinoceros?

35
00:04:08,138 --> 00:04:14,295
Then i'll tell you my secret.
I come along with you to Toyland.

36
00:04:15,264 --> 00:04:17,362
Even my mum won't allow it.

37
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:39,108
Why can't i go with them to Toyland?

38
00:04:39,606 --> 00:04:39,606
Because it's to far away.

39
00:04:40,832 --> 00:04:42,918
I don't care!

40
00:04:44,185 --> 00:04:49,722
Besides, the teady bears are huge there.

41
00:04:50,191 --> 00:04:52,538
Bigger than Paulchen?

42
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:55,030
Much bigger.

43
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:59,069
Much, much bigger. 
Come, lay down.

44
00:05:08,461 --> 00:05:11,581
We are not afraid of that, right Paulchen?

45
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:15,541
Mum, could you please keep the light on?

46
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,830
Stop!!
Jew scum!

47
00:05:25,874 --> 00:05:27,578
I'm looking for my child.

48
00:05:29,449 --> 00:05:32,373
Where is your starlet?

49
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:36,758
Where is your star??

50
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:49,900
Not a jew?

51
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,680
I'm looking for my child.

52
00:05:51,904 --> 00:05:53,915
My son has to be here somewhere?

53
00:06:08,867 --> 00:06:11,721
Why didn't you say you will travel?

54
00:06:14,714 --> 00:06:15,261
Forgot.

55
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,819
Anyway, i come with you to Toyland.

56
00:06:21,277 --> 00:06:23,269
That's not possible.

57
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:26,419
But we are blood brothers.

58
00:06:28,387 --> 00:06:31,756
We swore we will always stick together.

59
00:06:33,614 --> 00:06:37,723
I will take along the notes.
Then we can practice whenever we want.

60
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:22,471
Name of the neighbors?
Silberstein.

61
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:24,804
Usually everything works fine here.

62
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:28,244
Your son wanted to go with them?
Because they are friends.

63
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:29,579
Wagon 3, Obersturmführer.

64
00:08:18,593 --> 00:08:20,304
David!
Wait for me!

65
00:08:51,601 --> 00:08:54,031
Heinrich, darling, we don't want to 
play hide-and-seek.

66
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,597
Come to me, boy.

67
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:36,689
But i want to go to my friend!

68
00:09:40,857 --> 00:09:42,845
I want to go to Toyland.

69
00:09:43,301 --> 00:09:45,409
There is no Toyland.

70
00:10:13,738 --> 00:10:14,390
Heinrich, come!

71
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:23,655
One moment.

72
00:10:27,851 --> 00:10:30,722
Let us do that.

73
00:10:40,946 --> 00:10:42,887
So handsome.
Like the mother.

74
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,996
Next time you don't scare your mother like that, promise?
We still need you.

75
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:50,481
Come, you'll go home.

76
00:10:51,427 --> 00:10:55,620
Please excuse this trouble, madam.
Good Bye.

77
00:10:58,474 --> 00:11:00,614
Scharführer, you have to explain how this mishap could happen.

78
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,647
Do we play again?
