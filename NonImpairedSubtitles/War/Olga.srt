I hope you two
wiII get aIong---

154
00:20:24,725 --> 00:20:27,936
since you'II have to pretend
to be man and wife-

155
00:20:28,562 --> 00:20:31,356
A weaIthy coupIe on
their honeymoon-

156
00:20:31,565 --> 00:20:35,861
I wiII make sure you get to
BraziI safeIy- Do not worry-

157
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:40,824
The necessary measures
have aIready been taken-

158
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:44,119
You'II go to France first---

159
00:21:05,265 --> 00:21:08,560
Forgive me for this
separation"," mother-

160
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:12,856
If at Ieast you couId
teII us something-

161
00:21:13,065 --> 00:21:15,776
When do you expect
to get to BraziI?

162
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:21,823
The Iess I teII you","
the safer you'II be-

163
00:21:23,784 --> 00:21:28,247
I know you have duties","
so I won't compIain-

164
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:32,459
I onIy wonder whether
this is the right time-

165
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:38,298
I'm afraid of what they might
do to you"," if you're caught-

166
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:46,348
-I'II be safe-
-You're a wanted man in BraziI-

167
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:50,602
President Vargas aIways wanted
either your support or your death-

168
00:21:51,728 --> 00:21:55,148
You shouId stay Ionger in Moscow-

169
00:21:55,357 --> 00:21:58,110
I don't want to Iive in
exiIe anymore-

170
00:21:58,318 --> 00:22:03,198
It's time to return-
I've no more time to Iose-

171
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:08,120
I know your thoughts---

172
00:22:08,328 --> 00:22:10,747
your feeIings---

173
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,542
every word-

174
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:18,463
Every gesture-

175
00:22:19,715 --> 00:22:21,675
I'II aIways be with you-

176
00:22:35,314 --> 00:22:37,941
Promise you'II never
Ieave mother aIone-

177
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:07,846
Those footsteps-

178
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:11,892
I know I'II never hear
them again-

179
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:15,562
Ever-

180
00:23:18,899 --> 00:23:22,402
These are our new passports-
Senhor and Senhora ViIar-

181
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:27,032
FareweIIs are aIways tough-

182
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:31,078
That's why I prefer having
no one to say good-bye to---

183
00:23:31,286 --> 00:23:32,830
or waiting for me-

184
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:36,041
What about your famiIy?

185
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:39,044
I haven't seen them for a Iong
time- It is better that way-

186
00:23:39,753 --> 00:23:43,382
FeeIings and doubts are
unsuitabIe for any mission-

187
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:52,349
Let's go- It's a Iong way-

188
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:40,661
You remind me of my mother-

189
00:27:44,373 --> 00:27:46,875
The same frankness---

190
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:51,797
the tone of voice of
a determined woman-

191
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:56,009
Mistress of your own destiny-

192
00:27:57,845 --> 00:27:59,638
Does she dance weII?

193
00:28:00,347 --> 00:28:02,266
Sorry for treading on your foot-

194
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:08,730
And my fauIts? Are they simiIar
to Dona Leocádia's?

195
00:28:09,857 --> 00:28:13,527
Your nerves seem
to be made of steeI-

196
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:16,822
And you can be rather---

197
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:20,242
Harsh- My work demands it-

198
00:28:22,244 --> 00:28:24,163
Do you get aIong
with your mother?

199
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:29,751
I admire her- She raised me
and my sisters by herseIf-

200
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:33,255
Taught me to fight injustices-

201
00:28:33,714 --> 00:28:36,300
My country can be crueI
to those without money-

202
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:38,719
You must be anxious
to swing into action-

203
00:28:38,927 --> 00:28:41,471
We've been preparing for that-

204
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,932
We'II act at the right moment-

205
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:51,940
You Iook particuIarIy
attractive tonight-

206
00:28:55,402 --> 00:28:58,197
It's part of the disguise-

207
00:29:02,075 --> 00:29:05,037
These expensive cIothes
are outrageous-

208
00:29:05,913 --> 00:29:08,582
I know it is our work---

209
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,712
but certain intimacies---
If I have been too forward---

210
00:29:13,921 --> 00:29:17,424
You are the most gentIemanIy
army captain I've ever met-

211
00:29:19,885 --> 00:29:25,516
Yet your situation can't be easy
having to protect a man-

212
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:27,559
I was trained for it-

213
00:29:56,964 --> 00:29:59,216
Midnight at Iast!

214
00:30:02,761 --> 00:30:05,514
Happy New Year!

215
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:18,777
The Captain himseIf asked me
to bring you both champagne-

216
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:45,304
Aren't you going to kiss her?

217
00:30:45,512 --> 00:30:47,764
It's New Year!

218
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:50,976
She's your wife!

219
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:08,155
''To iIIuminate forever-''

220
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:11,992
''IIIuminate everything- ''

221
00:33:12,201 --> 00:33:15,329
''To the Iast days of eternity-''

222
00:33:16,872 --> 00:33:21,502
''IIIuminate"," nothing more-''

223
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:27,132
''That is my motto","
and that of the sun-''

224
00:33:30,761 --> 00:33:33,347
That poem certainIy suits you-

225
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:49,655
Soon you'II be safe in BraziI","
and our IittIe farce wiII be over-

226

You couId stay with us-
Your experience wouId be usefuI-

227
00:33:56,078 --> 00:33:58,914
I am sureIy to be given
another task-

228
00:34:28,402 --> 00:34:30,112
That kiss"," OIga----

229
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:33,407
I know you didn't want to-
The situation forced it on us-

230
00:34:36,076 --> 00:34:38,996
I did want to-

231
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:17,469
Good morning!

I hope the Iong journey
isn't tiring you"," Senhora ViIar-

I'd never forgive myseIf-

00:36:24,810 --> 00:36:27,271
At Ieast there are no
spies on board-

235
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:34,236
Funny"," but ever since
the Russian RevoIution---

236
00:36:34,444 --> 00:36:37,239
there's aIways a hint
of conspiracy in the air-

237
00:36:37,447 --> 00:36:39,158
-Don't you agree"," Herr Fischer?
-Yes-

238
00:36:39,366 --> 00:36:41,743
The sea never tires me"," Captain-
It soothes me-

239

Even if we were in the middIe
of a war"," I'd feeI comforted-

240
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:48,375
That must be because
you Iive in Lisbon-

241
00:36:48,584 --> 00:36:51,545
The Portuguese Iove the sea-

242

Forgive me my rudeness"," but---

243
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:00,721
are you a Jew?

244

No"," of course not-

Thank God!

Do you advocate the principIes
of Nazi Fascism"," Herr Fischer?

248
00:37:16,778 --> 00:37:19,364
Like aII true Germans-

249
00:37:19,573 --> 00:37:22,868
The Jewish bankers
ruined Germany-

250

They and the VersaiIIes Treaty-

251
00:37:25,871 --> 00:37:29,208
EngIand and France wanted
to humiIiate us-

252
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:32,961
Fascism wiII protect us
from the Communists---

nation once again-

Do excuse me-

Herr Fischer seems suspicious-

258
00:38:05,953 --> 00:38:09,164
Another Nazi wanting an audience
for his dreadfuI speeches-

259
00:38:09,832 --> 00:38:11,834
Where does such hatred come from?

260
00:38:14,044 --> 00:38:15,295
And the Captain?
What do you think?

261
00:38:15,504 --> 00:38:17,130
He was onIy trying to
drum up some attention-

-Whose attention?
-Yours-

-What are you taIking about?

You'II catch coId-

267

I meant no offense by suggesting

Why not?

I never had the time
for such things-

Never wanted to find time-

00:56:55,624 --> 00:56:57,876
-It's an isoIated attack-
-And the Aviation Academy?

457
00:56:58,085 --> 00:57:01,713
-If the rebeIs take the pIanes
-I doubt it'II Iast tiII nightfaII-

458
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,174
No other officer wiII
support Prestes!

459
00:57:04,383 --> 00:57:06,009
And the popuIation is
under our controI-

460
00:57:25,821 --> 00:57:27,906
The 3rd Regiment-

461
00:57:28,699 --> 00:57:31,743
The revoIt has been crushed-

462
00:57:40,627 --> 00:57:43,797
-And at the other barracks?
-Not one rose up-

463
00:57:44,006 --> 00:57:47,759
Vargas stiII controIs the
Army"," Navy and Air Force-

464
00:57:48,218 --> 00:57:49,928
And the peopIe?
The generaI strike?

465
00:57:50,137 --> 00:57:53,390
The generaI strike we caIIed for
hasn't stopped anyone-

466
00:57:53,849 --> 00:57:57,144
No a singIe factory-
Not one demonstration-

467
00:57:57,352 --> 00:57:59,563
But our supporters---

468
00:58:00,522 --> 00:58:03,859
aII those promises? The Army?!

469
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,426
We trained so much-

470
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:33,013
For this?

471
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:47,736
He didn't deserve that defeat-
He didn't deserve it-

472
00:58:54,618 --> 00:58:58,914
To fight for what is just---

473
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:03,710
good"," and for a better worId-

474
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:06,463
I don't care if thousands
have been arrested-

475
00:59:06,672 --> 00:59:09,758
I want the Ieaders!
I want Prestes in jaiI-

476
00:59:09,967 --> 00:59:11,593
He's smart- Catching him
won't be easy-

477
00:59:11,802 --> 00:59:14,638
CIeverer than the foreign
Secret Services?

478
00:59:14,847 --> 00:59:16,890
UntiI the investigations
are finished---

479
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:19,643
the State of Emergency
wiII continue-

480
00:59:22,062 --> 00:59:24,064
How about the German poIice?

481
00:59:24,314 --> 00:59:27,609
They are assisting as best they can-
It is hard to work undercover-

482
00:59:27,818 --> 00:59:30,904
It's better that way-
I don't want journaIists gossiping-

483
00:59:31,488 --> 00:59:34,783
They've found cIues that
foreigners are invoIved-

484
00:59:34,992 --> 00:59:37,536
-Foreigners?
-Sent from Moscow-

485
00:59:41,748 --> 00:59:44,084
-Let me go!
-What's is this?!

486
00:59:44,293 --> 00:59:46,044
-I'm an American citizen!
-Shut up!

487
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:49,756
-I demand an expIanation!
-Shut up! Take them both!

488
01:00:13,363 --> 01:00:15,991
I want to contact the
American Embassy!

489
01:00:24,374 --> 01:00:27,586
What's that?! What are you
doing to my husband?!

490
01:00:28,295 --> 01:00:31,298
-No!
-No! Don't!

491
01:00:36,512 --> 01:00:39,681
This information couId
incriminate many peopIe!

492
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:43,644
-We cannot take it aII with us!
-But if the poIice finds this materiaI---

493
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:46,188
they'II know about the movement","
about Moscow!

494
01:00:53,237 --> 01:00:56,532
You must Ieave- I'II stay
and destroy everything-

495
01:00:56,907 --> 01:00:59,368
To be arrested by the poIice?

496
01:01:00,953 --> 01:01:03,872
The expIosives Gruber
set up wiII do the trick-

497
01:01:08,085 --> 01:01:09,211
HeIIo?

498
01:01:12,256 --> 01:01:13,799
-Yes-
-What is it?

499
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:17,553
Nothing important-

500
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:32,234
Here's the address-

501
01:01:43,537 --> 01:01:46,081
They've got away!
There's no one here!

502
01:01:50,043 --> 01:01:52,337
CarefuI!
It's probabIy wired!

503
01:01:52,546 --> 01:01:54,339
You guys afraid?

504
01:02:15,986 --> 01:02:17,863
See?

505
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:23,785
We've found ourseIves
a treasure here-

506
01:02:24,536 --> 01:02:26,914
What's in those papers?

507
01:02:28,832 --> 01:02:31,335
They beIong to Prestes-

508
01:02:32,169 --> 01:02:34,963
Luis CarIos Prestes!

509
01:02:36,465 --> 01:02:39,927
Your new hideout is in Meyer---

510
01:02:40,302 --> 01:02:42,429
a discreet house-

511
01:02:43,096 --> 01:02:45,390
You'II be safe there-

512
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:48,852
-And you"," Barron?
-I'II contact Moscow-

513
01:02:49,061 --> 01:02:51,605
The other envoys must
Ieave the country-

514
01:02:55,692 --> 01:02:58,403
It was VaIIée on the phone-

515
01:02:58,821 --> 01:03:01,281
I've been given permission
to return-

516
01:03:02,407 --> 01:03:05,327
Perhaps it wouId be best for
you to Ieave the country now---

517
01:03:05,869 --> 01:03:08,288
avoiding unnecessary risks
by staying with me-

518
01:03:08,497 --> 01:03:12,835
Our opinions aImost aIways
coincide- Except on this matter-

519
01:03:16,171 --> 01:03:19,007
Our Iife in that house---

520
01:03:19,633 --> 01:03:22,553
In spite of everything","
I've no regrets-

521
01:03:23,512 --> 01:03:25,973
Now it's my turn to ask-

522
01:03:26,431 --> 01:03:30,185
My mind is made up-
I'II stay with you-

523
01:03:45,492 --> 01:03:47,870
<i>If you need anythlng else,
"l'll be out back"-</i>

524
01:03:48,078 --> 01:03:49,371
Thank you"," ManueI-

525
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:55,669
The safe's security rig
didn't expIode-

526
01:03:55,878 --> 01:03:57,588
It didn't?!

527
01:04:04,219 --> 01:04:06,054
The poIice found aII
the documents-

528
01:04:06,263 --> 01:04:09,600
Names"," signatures"," addresses-

529
01:04:10,476 --> 01:04:13,812
VaIIée managed to escape"," but
Miranda's just been arrested-

530
01:04:14,021 --> 01:04:16,732
Gruber was too experienced
to be so incompetent-

531
01:04:16,940 --> 01:04:18,692
We've been betrayed!

532
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:20,652
Gruber gave the poIice
the combination-

533
01:04:24,781 --> 01:04:26,783
-And Ewert and Sabo?
-They've been tortured---

534
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:29,495
but said nothing-
But those papers---

535
01:04:29,703 --> 01:04:31,914
wiII give the the poIice
proof against them-

536
01:04:32,122 --> 01:04:35,751
-And EIza"," Miranda's wife?
-She's aIso been arrested-

537
01:04:36,627 --> 01:04:40,172
This man"," do you know who he is?

538
01:04:43,217 --> 01:04:45,511
I won't a second time!

539
01:04:47,846 --> 01:04:50,808
I won't ask a second time-

540
01:04:51,016 --> 01:04:53,769
GhioIdi- It's GhioIdi-

541
01:04:53,977 --> 01:04:56,230
Miranda wiII confirm it-

542
01:05:02,528 --> 01:05:06,114
UnfuIfiIIed intentions","
faiIed attempts-

543
01:05:06,323 --> 01:05:08,116
What doesn't happen is aIso
part of history-

544
01:05:08,325 --> 01:05:09,910
That too can change the worId-

545
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:12,454
At the cost of so many
arrests and deaths?

546
01:05:13,914 --> 01:05:17,751
I was poIiticaIIy responsibIe for
the uprising- It was my fauIt-

547
01:05:21,255 --> 01:05:23,966
I was sure the Army wouId
support the revoIution-

548
01:05:25,175 --> 01:05:26,760
When I Ied the CoIumn
even at the worst hours---

549
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:28,470
when we fought
the government troops---

550
01:05:28,679 --> 01:05:31,140
our wiII to fight prevaiIed-

551
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:35,060
-But now---
-The Russian RevoIution taught us---

552
01:05:35,269 --> 01:05:37,646
the impossibIe is possibIe-

553
01:05:37,855 --> 01:05:41,775
Why doubt our ideaIs couId
change this country?

554
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:43,652
We fought for this-

555
01:05:44,069 --> 01:05:48,031
We're wiIIing to give our
Iives for the revoIution-

556
01:05:49,700 --> 01:05:52,327
-I know nothing about Prestes-
-Are you sure?

557
01:05:55,706 --> 01:05:58,625
I don't! I swear!

558
01:05:58,876 --> 01:06:02,796
I don't know where he is!
He moved to another hideout!

559
01:06:05,924 --> 01:06:07,593
GhioIdi!

560
01:06:07,926 --> 01:06:10,762
-Carmem-
-GhioIdi-

561
01:06:11,138 --> 01:06:12,514
Carmem!

562
01:06:12,723 --> 01:06:17,519
Do you want her to get out
of this country aIive? It's your caII-

563
01:06:17,728 --> 01:06:19,855
I don't know where he
and his wife are!

564
01:06:20,272 --> 01:06:23,817
Wife? What wife?

565
01:06:24,026 --> 01:06:25,486
Prestes is married?!

566
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:29,531
Her name?!
I want to know her name!

567
01:06:29,740 --> 01:06:31,658
Go ahead-

568
01:06:31,867 --> 01:06:33,869
Her name!

569
01:06:35,621 --> 01:06:37,164
Her name!

570
01:06:38,665 --> 01:06:40,542
OIga!

571
01:06:40,751 --> 01:06:44,463
Her name is OIga-

572
01:06:48,717 --> 01:06:50,552
OIga-

573
01:08:15,387 --> 01:08:17,806
You're even more beautifuI
when you smiIe-

574
01:08:27,649 --> 01:08:30,194
What have you got there?

575
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:42,498
I hope it fits you-
I Iack practice---

576
01:08:42,706 --> 01:08:45,709
but I wanted to make you
something to wear-

577
01:08:47,169 --> 01:08:50,130
When we fIed"," you couIdn't
bring anything with you-

578
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:04,812
I Iearned to sew from my sisters-

579
01:09:07,397 --> 01:09:11,360
I've never met a man Iike you-

580
01:09:11,568 --> 01:09:14,988
One with such deIicate gestures---

581
01:09:16,073 --> 01:09:19,159
and such great dreams-

582
01:09:25,499 --> 01:09:27,793
May I?

583
01:09:32,256 --> 01:09:35,926
I promise I'II try to
spare your feet-

584
01:11:19,988 --> 01:11:21,949
President Vargas himseIf
has phoned me-

585
01:11:22,157 --> 01:11:25,077
-He wants us to end this-
-And if we find the coupIe?

586
01:11:25,285 --> 01:11:27,830
Go in shooting
then ask questions"," GaIvao-

587

Do you want Prestes

The first one who gets Prestes","

She shouId never have met us","
or taken part in meetings-

We must ask the Party for heIp-
