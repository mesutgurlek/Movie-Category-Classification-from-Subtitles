00:00:02,692 --> 00:00:07,359
'The Mediterranean
- the shores of North Africa. '

2
00:00:09,293 --> 00:00:17,307
'Peaceful now - sixteen years ago
the battlefield of giants,...

3
00:00:18,756 --> 00:00:20,759
.. the Eighth Army,...

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:23,939
.. Rommel's Afrika Korps. '

5
00:00:26,324 --> 00:00:28,590
'Along its barren coast...

6
00:00:28,803 --> 00:00:30,442
.. the little towns...

7
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,568
.. Mersa Matruh,...

8
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,917

.. through them...

00:00:56,638 --> 00:00:59,564
.. and the desert around them. '

16
00:01:09,885 --> 00:01:12,218
'Two million men,...

17
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:15,936
.. two million stories. '

'This is one. '

00:01:19,566 --> 00:01:22,070
'It happens to be true. '

20
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:16,618
Hello, Paul.

21
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:18,364
Everything OK?

22
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:23,223
Only just. It's bloody down there,
dropping heavy stuff all the time.

23
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:25,583
We got the wounded off, though.
Have a drink?

24
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:27,735
Lay off that stuff.

25
00:04:30,626 --> 00:04:32,853
What the hell was that?

26
00:04:32,893 --> 00:04:36,377
Ammo dump -
must be touching off our own stuff.

27
00:04:36,417 --> 00:04:40,942
Any minute now, it'll be
"Naafi and Paymasters first"

28
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:47,155
Any news? The men keep asking damn
fool questions - what'll I say?

29
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:49,827
Nobody knows what's happening.

30
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:53,426
Just tell them
everything'll be all right.

31
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:57,104
In another siege it'll be all right
for the lucky ones who get sent out.

32
00:04:57,144 --> 00:05:00,677
If there's a siege,
you'll be among them.

33
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:06,403
You'll be on the town with Ariadne
while I'm on my arse, being bombed.

34
00:05:06,584 --> 00:05:10,675
I doubt it - experience in the Army
is always a factor.

35
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:15,148
I went through the last one.
I'm ideal to go through the next.

36
00:05:15,188 --> 00:05:18,095
I'll damn well see you don't.

37
00:05:19,556 --> 00:05:22,516
I wonder what Ariadne's doing now?

38
00:05:24,148 --> 00:05:29,817
Tucked up warm and snug in bed
in Alexandria, I suppose.

39
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:33,514
Message from Corps HQ, sir.

40
00:05:33,554 --> 00:05:35,597
Thank you, Corporal.

41
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:45,354
Evening, sir.

42
00:05:45,394 --> 00:05:48,564
Evening, Anson.
Women get off all right?

43
00:05:48,604 --> 00:05:53,424
I never wanted nurses but the Army
insisted - thought a woman's touch...

44
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:56,953
.. made the poor devils feel
they're on the road home.

45
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:59,679
Sit down - here's the picture.

46
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:04,580
The line's breached, but they're
the wrong side of the minefield.

47
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:10,488
We've taken a bashing so we're
re-forming to the east, to try again.

48
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:15,657
Meanwhile, there's a chance their
armour may breach our perimeter.

49
00:06:15,697 --> 00:06:16,871
Another siege, sir?

50
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:19,915
The niceties of military terms

51
00:06:19,955 --> 00:06:24,309
The point is, we're
not leaving any unnecessary stuff.

52
00:06:24,349 --> 00:06:29,648
Your unit, less 25 ambulances, will
leave at 0100 hours, back to Salum.

53
00:06:29,794 --> 00:06:33,654
The 25 ambulances,
commanded by a subaltern,...

54
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:37,946
.. will be under orders
of the colonel at the hospital here.

55
00:06:44,932 --> 00:06:49,922
There's a thing - never a moment's
peace, never a moment's peace

56
00:06:49,962 --> 00:06:52,781
Take a man going to the latrine...

57
00:06:52,821 --> 00:06:56,373
- perfectly natural thing to do -
then this happens.

58
00:06:56,413 --> 00:06:59,185
No wonder they get constipated!

59
00:07:03,694 --> 00:07:06,471
I'd like a drink - how about you?

60
00:07:06,918 --> 00:07:08,841
Thank you, sir.

61
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:16,983
These men who are staying behind
- how are you going to detail them?

62
00:07:17,023 --> 00:07:21,458
Unmarried men, sir - put names
in a hat and pull out what I need.

63
00:07:21,498 --> 00:07:23,968
Of course, I'll stay myself.

64
00:07:24,008 --> 00:07:28,075
Nonsense. Your job's with the bulk
of the unit, not little detachments.

65
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:31,867
How about the big chap,
what's his name, Crosbie?

66
00:07:31,907 --> 00:07:34,796
I'd rather leave a subaltern, sir.

67
00:07:34,836 --> 00:07:36,377
Crosbie went through the last siege.

68
00:07:36,417 --> 00:07:41,416
Then he'll know what it's all about,
and he hasn't a nerve in his body.

69
00:07:41,456 --> 00:07:41,931
Yes, sir, but I...

70
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:44,493
That's settled, then.

71
00:07:47,824 --> 00:07:52,411
Yes, sir. I'll leave with the bulk
of the unit at 0100 hours.

72
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:56,585
No, pick me up at first light
and drop me at Corps HQ.

73
00:07:56,625 --> 00:08:01,491
My car was blown up this morning
outside my own blasted front door.

74
00:08:09,739 --> 00:08:12,072
Look, sir, I wonder if...

75
00:08:14,018 --> 00:08:17,899
.. would you mind
telling Crosbie yourself?

76
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:22,209
All right.

77
00:08:23,594 --> 00:08:25,848
Thank you, sir.

78
00:08:31,433 --> 00:08:33,976
Capt Anson's just come back, sir.

79
00:08:34,016 --> 00:08:34,759
Close that ruddy blackout! >

80
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,284
Sorry, sir.

81
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:39,216
If you'd inspected properly,...

82
00:08:39,413 --> 00:08:44,352
.. it wouldn't need a warrant officer
under here to show you how to do it.

83
00:08:44,392 --> 00:08:46,187
Now finish off.

84
00:08:46,227 --> 00:08:48,304
Fresh oil in the sump.

85
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:53,389
If you don't report falling oil
pressure again you're for it, m'lad.

86
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:56,098
Switch out the light.

87
00:09:09,635 --> 00:09:11,183
Paul?

88
00:09:13,043 --> 00:09:19,007
Look... I... I tried to fix it, but
the Brig just wouldn't wear it.

89
00:09:19,165 --> 00:09:21,715
You fixed it all right

90
00:09:45,243 --> 00:09:50,172
Sgt Major
- sit down, have a drink.

91
00:09:50,917 --> 00:09:52,772
Thank you, sir.

92
00:09:55,356 --> 00:10:00,383
You're sure these ambulances we're
leaving behind are the best, eh?

93
00:10:00,423 --> 00:10:04,288
Yes, sir. There was a call
for one to go to the docks.

94
00:10:04,328 --> 00:10:07,703
So I sent one
that was being left behind.

95
00:10:10,275 --> 00:10:12,029
I'm sorry,...

96
00:10:13,804 --> 00:10:16,353
.. I'm pretty well pooped out.

97
00:10:16,662 --> 00:10:19,542
You've had just about enough, sir.

98
00:10:19,692 --> 00:10:21,388
Of that?

99
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:27,347
Of everything, sir. Look - everyone
knows what they've got to do.

100
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,688
Why don't you get some sleep, sir?

101
00:10:31,002 --> 00:10:32,686
Crosbie.

102
00:10:32,887 --> 00:10:35,699
I'll talk to Capt Crosbie, sir.

103
00:10:41,877 --> 00:10:46,441
Well, don't forget
to put that in the Humber.

104
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:50,535
It can go with your precious tools
in the back.

105
00:10:50,861 --> 00:10:52,524
Sir?

106
00:10:52,564 --> 00:10:54,858
Yes, you're coming out, too.

107
00:10:55,085 --> 00:10:57,304
I'd rather stay behind, sir.

108
00:10:57,429 --> 00:11:00,377
You... are coming... out.

109
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:06,814
You lie down, sir, just for an hour.

110
00:11:07,892 --> 00:11:12,456
I'll call you when
the main column's ready to move off.

111
00:11:12,563 --> 00:11:15,079
Come on, sir, come on.

112
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:51,212
Mr Pugh, you forgot that box of mine
- fetch it!

113
00:11:51,355 --> 00:11:53,108
Right, sir.

114
00:11:57,134 --> 00:12:02,344
Goodbye, Sgt Major - I see you've
everything laid on for this party.

115
00:12:02,384 --> 00:12:04,077
We'll see you again soon, sir.

116
00:12:04,117 --> 00:12:05,659
I doubt it.

117
00:12:07,628 --> 00:12:09,620
Well, so long, Paul.

118
00:12:10,131 --> 00:12:13,773
Remember me to Ariadne
when you get to Alex.

119
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:17,426
Let's go, Sgt Major.

120
00:12:25,997 --> 00:12:28,786
You right bastard!

121
00:12:49,265 --> 00:12:50,497
What are you doing here, Corporal?

122
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:52,943
Guarding the ladies, sir.

123
00:12:52,983 --> 00:12:53,590
Ladies?

124
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:58,087
Two got left behind last night
when the nurses was evacuated.

125
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:58,980
Morning, ma'am.

126
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,495
Morning. We're a bit of a problem!

127
00:13:00,535 --> 00:13:01,929
Why?

128
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:09,107
I'd never been in any bombing,
lost my nerve and ran, they sailed without us.

129
00:13:09,108 --> 00:13:09,508
Our kit's on board.

130
00:13:09,548 --> 00:13:12,262
That's the least of our worries.

131
00:13:12,505 --> 00:13:16,712
Hurry up. That stuff should be
loaded by now. Morning, Mr Pugh.

132
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:18,385
Morning, sir.

133
00:13:18,624 --> 00:13:26,274
Sister Murdoch, Sister Norton. Capt Anson'll get you
to Egypt and fix transport to Alex.

134
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:27,122
Your trouble!

135
00:13:27,162 --> 00:13:30,665
We'll try not to be any trouble.

136
00:13:30,705 --> 00:13:33,725
Right. Sgt Major, you drive the
ambulance and follow us to Corps HQ.

137
00:13:33,766 --> 00:13:35,706
Right, sir.

138
00:13:44,188 --> 00:13:48,878
Get over, man, get over.
Keep on the side. Over, man.

139
00:13:49,810 --> 00:13:53,043
Get over, into the side. Over.

140
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:13,003
Corps HQ - or would be if
it hadn't gone. Won't be a moment.

141
00:14:13,043 --> 00:14:15,158
Anson, I'm in a hurry
- can't trundle along with you.

142
00:14:15,198 --> 00:14:16,979
Yes, sir, but...

143
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:18,152
You can drive, can't you, Ponsonby?

144
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,246
Yes, sir.

145
00:14:20,247 --> 00:14:24,026
Come on, I'm uncomfortable
being too far behind Corps.

146
00:14:24,163 --> 00:14:25,428
Our kit, sir - can we off-load it?

147
00:14:25,468 --> 00:14:29,845
God, man, I'm only borrowing the car
- you'll get it back tonight.

148
00:14:30,032 --> 00:14:34,722
Don't just sit there, Ponsonby,
get going. Come on, man, GET GOING!

149
00:14:49,737 --> 00:14:54,552
Old Dangletoes is standing up.
waving his ruddy cap at 'em!

150
00:14:55,306 --> 00:14:58,983
I bet he's giving them hell
in that foul German of his.

151
00:15:05,192 --> 00:15:06,922
My tool kit!

152
00:15:07,117 --> 00:15:08,608
My whisky.

153
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:22,585
It's all right, Denise.

154
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,273
I can't stand it!

155
00:15:25,313 --> 00:15:27,077
Lie down on the floor
and pack the blankets round you.

156
00:15:27,117 --> 00:15:29,148
All right.

157
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:42,942
Let's go, Tom.

158
00:16:09,304 --> 00:16:10,287
Sorry, old boy,
I'm blowing that bridge.

159
00:16:10,327 --> 00:16:15,227
Don't be a bloody fool. I must get
through, there's two nurses here.

160
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:17,157
Orders from Corps to get 'em back.

161
00:16:17,197 --> 00:16:21,039
You can have the Angel Gabriel
inside - it's blowing, so get back.

162
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:22,862
Get going, Tom.

163
00:16:22,902 --> 00:16:26,174
I shouldn't if I were you.
You've got 15 seconds - LET'S GO!

164
00:16:28,615 --> 00:16:33,305
Back off sideways or you'll
catch the blast on the windscreen.

165
00:16:33,585 --> 00:16:36,306
Lie down - there'll be a bang. >

166
00:16:40,009 --> 00:16:41,625
Take it easy.

167
00:16:45,338 --> 00:16:49,198
You'd better get weaving
- you've had it. Good luck.

168
00:16:49,326 --> 00:16:52,468
Thanks. Okay, Tom, I'll drive.

169
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:54,239
Right, sir.

170
00:17:14,306 --> 00:17:17,301
That was the bridge
over the tank trap being blown up.

171
00:17:17,341 --> 00:17:19,645
What do we do now?

172
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:22,174
Only two things we can do.

173
00:17:22,214 --> 00:17:28,617
Get back to the hospital. There's going to be a siege,
or try crossing the minefield.

174
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:30,722
We'll take you back to the hospital.

175
00:17:30,762 --> 00:17:32,154
What will you do then?

176
00:17:32,194 --> 00:17:35,113
Have a crack at the minefield.

177
00:17:35,153 --> 00:17:38,060
LET ME OUT OF HERE, LET ME OUT!

178
00:17:40,087 --> 00:17:42,101
We'll come with you.

179
00:17:44,293 --> 00:17:47,230
Dames and mines - lovely party.

180
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:53,690
See if she needs help.

181
00:17:53,730 --> 00:17:55,465
Right, sir.

182
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:09,236
Let me out, let me out...

183
00:18:20,703 --> 00:18:23,481
Let me out, let me out!

184
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:02,143
Sorry. I've got brandy in my bag.

185
00:19:03,332 --> 00:19:04,728
Want some?

186
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:07,016
Want some?
After you, miss.

187
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,689
What about Capt Anson?

188
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,367
No, miss.

189
00:19:14,677 --> 00:19:16,705
Why not?

190
00:19:16,745 --> 00:19:22,613
Better not. Well, I've been up and
down the desert with him five times.

191
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:26,840
He's never spared himself,
or us, for that matter.

192
00:19:27,282 --> 00:19:32,506
There's plenty alive in hospitals
today who owe their lives to him.

193
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:34,768
Then he was captured.

194
00:19:34,808 --> 00:19:38,742
Oh, he escaped all right, but
he'd a hell of a time getting back.

195
00:19:38,782 --> 00:19:42,886
Two nights walking,
lying up in the day, no water.

196
00:19:42,926 --> 00:19:47,925
He should have had a break -
he's driven himself to a standstill.

197
00:19:47,965 --> 00:19:50,952
And he's trying to lace himself up
with drink?

198
00:19:51,124 --> 00:19:53,164
That's about it.

199
00:19:53,204 --> 00:19:55,861
Maybe he just likes the taste.

200
00:19:58,452 --> 00:20:04,543
Don't worry, I won't give him any. I
won't even let him know I've got it.

201
00:20:19,173 --> 00:20:20,419
How are things in the back?

202
00:20:20,459 --> 00:20:24,631
Sister Murdoch's given her
an injection and she's out cold.

203
00:20:24,826 --> 00:20:28,605
We need eight cans to be safe.
Let's start.

204
00:20:28,734 --> 00:20:30,487
Right, sir. >

205
00:20:46,381 --> 00:20:47,337
Hey!

206
00:20:48,262 --> 00:20:49,890
Hey, Captain!

207
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,838
Can I grab a lift
and get the hell out of here?

208
00:20:59,879 --> 00:21:00,403
Where do you want to go?

209
00:21:00,443 --> 00:21:03,747
The delta - back to my own unit.

210
00:21:03,787 --> 00:21:07,887
I've been lent to Signals,
but I can't do them any good now.

211
00:21:07,927 --> 00:21:12,912
Man, I don't intend to get put in
the bag when the balloon goes up.

212
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:16,785
You can't go by road
- they've blown the tank bridge.

213
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:18,466
Where are you going?

214
00:21:18,506 --> 00:21:21,875
To have a bash
at crossing the minefield.

215
00:21:21,915 --> 00:21:24,596
I'd like to come with you, man.

216
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:29,917
Sorry, can't be done. Got a pair of
nurses in the back to get to Alex.

217
00:21:29,957 --> 00:21:37,806
Besides, you'd be extra weight, a lot of extra weight,
and we're short on rations and water.

218
00:21:41,354 --> 00:21:45,247
I can pay my way.
I've got a thousand cigarettes...

219
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:48,769
.. and three bottles of gin.

220
00:21:50,252 --> 00:21:52,198
Export or Naafi?

221
00:21:52,795 --> 00:21:56,745
The best, man, from South Africa.

222
00:21:59,018 --> 00:22:05,020
Well,... ah, I daresay we could,
er, do with another hand to push.

223
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:07,182
Okay, I'll take you. I'm Anson.

224
00:22:07,222 --> 00:22:09,246
Van der Poel.

225
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:11,108
Can I see your identity card?

226
00:22:11,148 --> 00:22:13,238
Sure.

227
00:22:13,278 --> 00:22:15,002
Thanks.

228
00:22:16,684 --> 00:22:18,442
My Sergeant Major, Mr Pugh
- Captain van der Pole.

229
00:22:18,482 --> 00:22:20,719
"van der Pooel".

230
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,907
Good morning, sir.

231
00:22:21,947 --> 00:22:23,537
The captain's coming to push.

232
00:22:23,577 --> 00:22:27,459
Yes, sir, another four jerry cans
and that's the lot, sir.

233
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:28,753
Start loading when you're ready.

234
00:22:28,793 --> 00:22:30,426
Right, sir.

235
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:32,885
Hot, isn't it?

236
00:22:33,031 --> 00:22:35,194
Yes. Like a drink?

237
00:22:35,907 --> 00:22:39,538
Why not? Got a couple of mugs
in the cab.

238
00:22:55,881 --> 00:22:58,096
What's happening?

239
00:22:58,136 --> 00:23:04,288
A South African officer's coming with us,
and he's feeding the captain gin.

240
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:16,318
What's this, a party?

241
00:23:16,474 --> 00:23:18,796
No, just one for the road.

242
00:23:20,132 --> 00:23:26,063
The first road is through a minefield
- is that the usual training?

243
00:23:28,465 --> 00:23:31,197
You know, the lady's right.

244
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:41,023
Let's get cracking, shall we?

245
00:23:41,208 --> 00:23:43,803
Would you mind getting inside?

246
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:06,248
What's the matter with her? >

247
00:24:06,449 --> 00:24:08,999
She got into a panic
and we had to give her some dope.

248
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:09,865
That's the lot, sir.

249
00:24:09,905 --> 00:24:11,367
Right.

250
00:24:15,602 --> 00:24:18,185
Here you are, man, catch!

251
00:24:19,447 --> 00:24:21,929
And again!

252
00:24:23,652 --> 00:24:25,234
And again!

253
00:24:26,830 --> 00:24:28,628
And again!

254
00:24:30,936 --> 00:24:32,473
Hey! Hup!

255
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,755
Hup!

256
00:24:36,136 --> 00:24:37,650
And hup!

257
00:24:43,218 --> 00:24:44,959
Hey, man!

258
00:24:55,355 --> 00:24:58,798
What's our chance
of getting through the minefield?

259
00:24:58,838 --> 00:25:03,703
Evens. I knew the tracks two years
ago - they may have re-mined it.

260
00:25:03,743 --> 00:25:04,568
Well, once we get through...

261
00:25:04,608 --> 00:25:07,390
Well, once we get through...
If we get through!

262
00:25:07,596 --> 00:25:11,603
If we get through
- what if we run into any Germans?

263
00:25:11,643 --> 00:25:15,869
They can't cover the whole perimeter
- there must be gaps.

264
00:25:15,909 --> 00:25:18,557
We may have to talk our way out.
Anyone speak German?

265
00:25:18,597 --> 00:25:20,005
No.

266
00:25:20,045 --> 00:25:24,320
I do, I worked with them
in SW Africa. How about the girls?

267
00:25:24,496 --> 00:25:29,380
No idea. Let's get through the
ruddy minefield first, shall we?

268
00:25:58,392 --> 00:26:02,672
There's not much danger
if we stick to the tracks.

269
00:26:05,943 --> 00:26:07,956
The tracks are faint.

270
00:26:07,996 --> 00:26:10,768
I'll walk the whole way in sections.

271
00:26:11,016 --> 00:26:16,204
You follow with the ambulance, Sgt Major,
ten yards behind, and watch the turns.

272
00:26:16,244 --> 00:26:17,602
Right, sir.

273
00:26:17,642 --> 00:26:19,349
It'll take hours, man.

274
00:26:19,389 --> 00:26:21,044
Right, it'll take hours.

275
00:26:21,084 --> 00:26:24,887
If I take the other track
it will halve the time.

276
00:26:24,927 --> 00:26:27,539
Yes... I can't ask you to do that.

277
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:30,435
You're heavier than I am, for one.

278
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:34,668
A Springbok can go where
any bloody Englishman can.

279
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:38,857
Right. Watch where the tyre marks
are interrupted.

280
00:26:39,142 --> 00:26:45,679
If you're not sure, shout. If you do feel something,
stay put the mines are live.

281
00:26:45,719 --> 00:26:46,642
Sure, sure, Captain.

282
00:26:46,682 --> 00:26:48,543
You take that one.

283
00:26:53,628 --> 00:26:56,167
We're going in, now.

284
00:28:45,149 --> 00:28:49,176
Come on, man,
we want to get through before dark.

285
00:28:49,216 --> 00:28:52,078
We want to get through, don't we?

286
00:29:37,201 --> 00:29:41,233
We're still in the minefield
- get back, miss.

287
00:29:41,273 --> 00:29:42,781
I can't see anything
through those windows in the back.

288
00:29:42,821 --> 00:29:46,059
That's the trouble, you can't,
unless something happens!

289
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:02,202
Which is it?

290
00:30:02,603 --> 00:30:05,551
This way, of course. Straight on.

291
00:30:05,734 --> 00:30:08,034
I don't agree.

292
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,222
I think that's the real one there.

293
00:30:11,262 --> 00:30:13,953
Well, I'm going to try this way.

294
00:30:14,230 --> 00:30:20,935
Stay there! I don't give a damn
if you blow yourself up. I'm trying my way first.

295
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:57,127
There's something under my foot.

296
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,779
Lift your foot up, gently.

297
00:32:14,385 --> 00:32:17,720
Sorry, no beans in it - souvenir.

298
00:32:20,506 --> 00:32:23,784
You've a funny sense of humour,
Captain.

299
00:32:25,862 --> 00:32:29,777
That should take him down a peg.
Serve him right, too.

300
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:34,172
Are all South Africans like that?

301
00:32:34,677 --> 00:32:38,769
He's Afrikaans
- Dutch - haven't met many myself.

302
00:32:38,809 --> 00:32:44,301
Capt Anson was with them for a time.
He says they're a decent enough lot.

303
00:32:49,198 --> 00:32:52,977
We're nearly through.
You'd better get back.

304
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,596
Bombers!

305
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,481
Heading this way. >

306
00:33:26,764 --> 00:33:29,749
Don't worry, we're not the target.

307
00:33:29,789 --> 00:33:32,116
They're after the minefield.

308
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:35,070
Man, I don't believe
there's a ruddy mine for miles.

309
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:36,800
Don't you?

310
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:08,229
Captain? I think I owe you a drink.

311
00:34:09,069 --> 00:34:10,753
Thanks.

312
00:34:13,924 --> 00:34:18,406
All right, Tom, don't stand there
with your tongue hanging out.

313
00:34:18,446 --> 00:34:23,073
They blasted a way through for their
armour - let's... get cracking, eh?

314
00:34:41,697 --> 00:34:43,290
God!

315
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:11,790
For God's sake, sir,
you'll break the springs!

316
00:35:11,830 --> 00:35:13,736
Shut up!

317
00:35:23,865 --> 00:35:26,665
If you don't stop they'll open fire.

318
00:35:47,866 --> 00:35:48,813
Stop, here!

319
00:35:48,854 --> 00:35:50,210
Get off!

320
00:35:50,250 --> 00:35:52,760
Stop, stop, she's been hit!

321
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:10,235
Stop, you fool, stop.

322
00:36:10,275 --> 00:36:12,181
Get out of it!

323
00:36:14,894 --> 00:36:17,694
What the hell are you doing?

324
00:36:21,962 --> 00:36:26,985
Hide our guns - they're funny
about arms on ambulances.

325
00:36:27,025 --> 00:36:31,376
Let me handle this.
Neither of you speak a word...

326
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:33,562
.. except to me.

327
00:36:35,019 --> 00:36:37,113
Sei vorsichtig!

328
00:36:51,386 --> 00:36:54,197
Sorry, Tom, I made a bog of it.

329
00:37:00,915 --> 00:37:03,861
Pop inside and see what's happened.

330
00:37:03,901 --> 00:37:11,693
Give me the gin. If we're going inside I'll drink the ruddy lot
before they get here. Give it to me.

331
00:37:27,277 --> 00:37:29,280
How is she?

332
00:37:30,386 --> 00:37:33,232
She'll be dead within an hour.

333
00:37:35,826 --> 00:37:37,749
Are you sure?

334
00:37:37,992 --> 00:37:40,394
Is there anything we can do?

335
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:43,330
Nothing anyone can do. I know.

336
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,935
Who... kicked... me?

337
00:38:04,716 --> 00:38:07,012
What's going on outside?

338
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:11,839
They've got us in the bag.
Capt van der Poel's talking to them.

339
00:38:12,036 --> 00:38:14,913
What will they do, send us back?

340
00:38:14,953 --> 00:38:17,860
No, not now we know they're here.

341
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,950
There's just a chance, though,
they may let us go on,...

342
00:38:22,248 --> 00:38:26,460
.. rather than take us in
with escorts and all that.

343
00:38:33,127 --> 00:38:36,474
Look, if you're so sure she's er...

344
00:38:38,730 --> 00:38:41,678
.. might be better not to tell Jerry.

345
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:46,835
They're more likely to let us go on
with someone wounded than...

346
00:39:00,751 --> 00:39:03,482
Tom, they're coming back.

347
00:39:12,046 --> 00:39:13,982
" Durchsuche sie I

348
00:39:22,376 --> 00:39:25,336
He wants to search the ambulance.

349
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:34,017
The captain says
he bitterly regrets this accident.

350
00:39:34,057 --> 00:39:38,536
If we'd stopped as we ought to
he would never have opened fire.

351
00:39:38,674 --> 00:39:39,980
Wie geht es ihr?

352
00:39:40,020 --> 00:39:42,450
Wie geht es ihr?
He wants to know how she is.

353
00:39:42,864 --> 00:39:45,801
Abdominal wound. It's not serious.

354
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:47,423
But we ought to get her to hospital.

355
00:39:47,463 --> 00:39:53,427
Kleine Magenwunde, die aber im
Krankenhaus behandelt werden muss.

356
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:56,386
Sagen Sie der Krankenschwester,
dass ich den Wagen durchsuchen will.

357
00:39:56,426 --> 00:40:00,314
He's going to search.

358
00:40:11,440 --> 00:40:15,398
Ich werde gleich
Ihre Geschichte pruefen.

359
00:40:15,438 --> 00:40:18,119
Natuerlich. Tun Sie das.

360
00:40:43,841 --> 00:40:45,560
What is it?

361
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,964
I have to get some more dressings
- will you stay with her?

362
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:07,111
Is there anything I should do?

363
00:41:07,575 --> 00:41:10,330
No. No, just be near.

364
00:41:23,492 --> 00:41:28,448
Captain van der Poel, will you ask if
they have any spare large dressings?

365
00:41:28,488 --> 00:41:30,229
I've used all ours.

366
00:41:30,269 --> 00:41:31,982
Sure.

367
00:41:52,034 --> 00:41:53,923
Cigarette?

368
00:41:54,014 --> 00:41:55,448
Thanks.

369
00:42:22,122 --> 00:42:23,055
How is she?

370
00:42:23,095 --> 00:42:25,399
She'll be all right.

371
00:42:29,508 --> 00:42:33,560
Not... d... duh... dut...

372
00:42:38,785 --> 00:42:41,666
Here you are. They're sorry
they can't spare any more.

373
00:42:41,706 --> 00:42:44,011
Thanks.

374
00:42:49,518 --> 00:42:52,444
Man, I think we've pulled it off.

375
00:43:11,187 --> 00:43:15,513
She talked quite a bit,
tried to get up to say something.

376
00:43:15,553 --> 00:43:17,266
She's dead, Tom.

377
00:43:18,106 --> 00:43:20,042
Also, sag' es ihnen.

378
00:43:20,302 --> 00:43:22,203
She's sleeping.

379
00:43:22,377 --> 00:43:25,293
He could put us in the bag...

380
00:43:25,333 --> 00:43:29,686
.. but as the nurse is wounded
he's going to let us go through.

381
00:44:20,288 --> 00:44:22,242
Sprechen Sie Englisch?

382
00:44:22,282 --> 00:44:23,824
Nein.

383
00:44:26,632 --> 00:44:28,966
I'm afraid the girl's gone.

384
00:44:29,161 --> 00:44:33,931
If he knows that he'll tell them
and that'll be our lot

385
00:44:45,562 --> 00:44:47,906
Why have they got Capt Anson?

386
00:44:47,946 --> 00:44:51,822
So we follow them
till we're clear of their troops.

387
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:55,812
Then they give us the captain back
and turn us loose.

388
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:57,800
Cigarette?

389
00:44:57,902 --> 00:44:58,688
No thanks.

390
00:44:58,835 --> 00:44:59,173
Tom?

391
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:02,099
Tom?
Please. Light me one, will you?

392
00:45:25,995 --> 00:45:27,566
Thank you.

393
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,838
Capt van der Poel,
can I ask you something?

394
00:45:32,878 --> 00:45:34,534
Mmmm?

395
00:45:35,026 --> 00:45:39,773
About Capt Anson.
He's had rather a bad time recently.

396
00:45:39,901 --> 00:45:41,972
Been drinking heavily.

397
00:45:42,196 --> 00:45:47,102
Probably screaming for one, now,
but we rely on him for navigation.

398
00:45:47,405 --> 00:45:49,901
Please don't give him any.

399
00:45:49,941 --> 00:45:51,242
Phah! What do I do if he asks?

400
00:45:51,282 --> 00:45:55,044
He won't. Just help him.
Keep it out of sight.

401
00:45:55,234 --> 00:46:01,143
0... kay... if I want one
I'll just go off by myself.

402
00:46:27,313 --> 00:46:28,232
Bleib hier mit Kapitaen Anson.

403
00:46:28,272 --> 00:46:30,236
Jawohl, Herr Hauptmann. "

404
00:46:30,363 --> 00:46:32,924
Kommen Sie mit mir, bitte.

405
00:46:38,249 --> 00:46:40,651
He wants to know how she is.

406
00:46:40,856 --> 00:46:42,238
Still asleep.

407
00:46:42,278 --> 00:46:46,199
Sie schlaeft noch.

408
00:46:47,227 --> 00:46:49,571
Geh so weg.

409
00:47:00,504 --> 00:47:01,633
Hals- und Beinbruch!

410
00:47:01,673 --> 00:47:02,230
What did he say?

411
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:03,812
Good luck.

412
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:37,794
Sure it's all right?

413
00:47:37,834 --> 00:47:39,740
Yes.

414
00:48:07,011 --> 00:48:13,079
If I know Driver Grimes, he'll have enough tea
tucked away to start a cafe.

415
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:15,231
Aha - half full.

416
00:48:18,368 --> 00:48:19,615
Can I do anything, man?

417
00:48:19,655 --> 00:48:24,413
Thank you, sir, if you start
the fire, I'll open the rations.

418
00:48:24,453 --> 00:48:26,713
That's for the water, sir.

419
00:48:27,399 --> 00:48:29,379
Here you are, sir.

420
00:48:29,643 --> 00:48:31,184
The spade for the sand.

421
00:48:31,224 --> 00:48:32,743
Sand?

422
00:48:32,972 --> 00:48:38,729
Sorry, I thought all South African
troops brewed up the same as us.

423
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:41,407
Don't worry, sir, I'll do it.

424
00:48:41,447 --> 00:48:44,309
Would you get water and petrol?

425
00:48:50,253 --> 00:48:52,837
Time to wake the captain.

426
00:48:57,107 --> 00:48:59,452
Well, take it, it's hot.

427
00:49:10,994 --> 00:49:13,896
Captain Anson, Captain Anson.

428
00:49:23,468 --> 00:49:26,576
What's happened?
Why have we stopped?

429
00:49:26,616 --> 00:49:31,221
Nothing's happened.
We've done the twenty-one miles.

430
00:49:33,922 --> 00:49:35,493
Thanks.

431
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:40,081
An awful wind's started,
blowing sand all over the place.

432
00:49:40,121 --> 00:49:43,736
It usually does when you brew up.

433
00:49:51,412 --> 00:49:56,774
We didn't want to tell you
till you'd had some rest.

434
00:50:10,906 --> 00:50:13,407
I can't write this one off.

435
00:50:13,447 --> 00:50:15,968
You couldn't help it.

436
00:50:16,095 --> 00:50:17,609
No?

437
00:50:17,757 --> 00:50:19,966
I'm a drunk, you know that?

438
00:50:20,103 --> 00:50:23,074
You were trying to get us away.

439
00:50:23,231 --> 00:50:25,985
No excuses - I don't want them.

440
00:50:28,635 --> 00:50:31,579
I'll tell you this...

441
00:50:31,619 --> 00:50:35,460
- the next drink I have
is going to be a lager,...

442
00:50:35,594 --> 00:50:37,369
.. ice cold.

443
00:50:39,445 --> 00:50:42,372
There's a little bar in Alex,...

444
00:50:42,412 --> 00:50:46,798
.. with a marble-topped counter
and high stools,...

445
00:50:46,838 --> 00:50:50,965
.. and they serve the best beer
in all the Middle East.

446
00:50:51,672 --> 00:50:55,542
When we get through with this lot,
I'll buy you one.

447
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,826
I'll buy you all one.

448
00:51:10,383 --> 00:51:12,956
Come and have some food.

449
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:49,640
It'll be dark soon, Tom.
We'd better get on with it.

450
00:51:49,817 --> 00:51:54,712
We'll build a cairn up there as a
marker and bury her in the morning.

451
00:51:54,923 --> 00:51:56,124
I'll wake van der Poel
and get him to lay on the grub.

452
00:51:56,164 --> 00:51:58,492
Right, sir.

453
00:52:02,143 --> 00:52:07,038
If it's not too much trouble,
get your can off there and brew up I

454
00:52:29,303 --> 00:52:30,319
Hello.

455
00:52:30,359 --> 00:52:33,329
Hello.
How's it going?

456
00:52:33,369 --> 00:52:36,289
Ach, man, you wait. I'm a good cook.

457
00:52:37,236 --> 00:52:39,581
We'll let you know later.

458
00:52:40,564 --> 00:52:45,072
Did I, er, tell you I was attached
to your division for a bit?

459
00:52:45,204 --> 00:52:46,945
Were you? When?

460
00:52:47,100 --> 00:52:50,179
Er, let's see, about last September.

461
00:52:50,219 --> 00:52:54,221
I wasn't there, then.
I only came up six months ago.

462
00:52:54,261 --> 00:52:58,627
I expect some of the blokes
on supplies are the same,...

463
00:52:58,667 --> 00:53:00,371
.. and, of course, old Dan Pinnear.

464
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:04,367
Jan Pinnaar - he's a character.

465
00:53:04,561 --> 00:53:08,728
He's so Afrikaans, I'm surprised
you could understand his English.

466
00:53:08,940 --> 00:53:10,715
We managed.

467
00:53:10,852 --> 00:53:13,766
Then there was... er, the colonel...

468
00:53:13,896 --> 00:53:16,752
.. in supplies... Colonel... er...

469
00:53:16,872 --> 00:53:18,385
.. Kramer?

470
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:21,686
Kramer?

471
00:53:21,843 --> 00:53:24,176
No, surely he was ordnance.

472
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:27,170
It was Colonel Maggs with supplies.

473
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:30,309
Yes, of course, Maggs.

474
00:53:31,744 --> 00:53:33,576
Smells good.

475
00:53:33,806 --> 00:53:38,496
Thanks to Mr Grimes, the biggest
scrounging so-and-so in the unit.

476
00:53:38,776 --> 00:53:41,497
Everything but the kitchen stove...

477
00:53:41,689 --> 00:53:46,595
- spuds, onions, steak and kidney
pud... all gone in with the bully.

478
00:53:50,779 --> 00:53:53,329
Man, that was good.

479
00:53:53,963 --> 00:53:56,911
Now, we'll have to have a watch.

480
00:53:57,115 --> 00:53:59,353
Let's see, there are three of us.

481
00:53:59,393 --> 00:54:00,998
Four.

482
00:54:01,038 --> 00:54:02,682
All right.

483
00:54:03,394 --> 00:54:09,267
You two take first shift till 12:30
and you and I'll take over till dawn

484
00:54:09,417 --> 00:54:12,176
That'll give us four hours each.

485
00:54:12,216 --> 00:54:16,817
We should be up at six and hit the
track near Piccadilly by sundown.

486
00:54:16,857 --> 00:54:19,894
It's a cakewalk to Sidi Barrani.

487
00:54:19,934 --> 00:54:23,821
Why not wait for daybreak,
see who's in Sidi?

488
00:54:24,048 --> 00:54:28,556
You mean Jerry? Hell, man,
Barrani's halfway to Alex.

489
00:54:28,673 --> 00:54:31,223
Well, it's your party.

490
00:54:38,587 --> 00:54:41,137
Where's he going?

491
00:54:41,316 --> 00:54:43,996
You, er... tell her, Tom.

492
00:54:44,036 --> 00:54:48,823
In the desert, you never ask anyone
where they're going with a spade.

493
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:51,731
That's common to both sides.

494
00:54:52,244 --> 00:54:56,146
What's he taking
that ruddy great pack for?

495
00:54:56,186 --> 00:54:58,846
There's something phoney about him.

496
00:54:58,886 --> 00:55:03,455
When we stopped at midday, he
hadn't a clue how to start a fire.

497
00:55:03,496 --> 00:55:07,063
He's probably always
had somebody to do it for him.

498
00:55:07,103 --> 00:55:08,446
He must have seen it done
- you'd think he'd...

499
00:55:08,486 --> 00:55:13,660
Let's get some rest
- douse the fire, will you?

500
00:55:17,217 --> 00:55:17,841
Night, Tom.

501
00:55:17,881 --> 00:55:19,355
G'night.

502
00:55:33,993 --> 00:55:40,448
Don't think me stupid
- I can't bear to see her covered up on a night like this.

503
00:55:40,691 --> 00:55:43,742
I didn't know her very well, really.

504
00:55:43,977 --> 00:55:48,189
She was rather a silly little thing,
awful flirt,...

505
00:55:48,609 --> 00:55:51,284
.. not even a very good nurse.

506
00:55:51,771 --> 00:55:56,734
I feel worse about this
than anything that's ever happened.

507
00:55:56,895 --> 00:56:02,006
You feel bad about it?
How the hell do you think I feel?

508
00:56:07,904 --> 00:56:11,681
It's done, man,
no use accusing yourself.

509
00:56:11,721 --> 00:56:15,631
Start playing around with war,
these things happen.

510
00:56:15,876 --> 00:56:18,984
What do you keep in that pack?

511
00:56:19,872 --> 00:56:21,460
Gin.

512
00:56:21,500 --> 00:56:23,201
Want some?

513
00:57:01,671 --> 00:57:04,004
Time to wake up, Tom.

514
00:57:12,970 --> 00:57:13,488
Capt van der Pole?

515
00:57:13,528 --> 00:57:16,049
Van der Pooel!

516
00:57:28,912 --> 00:57:30,858
What is it?

517
00:57:39,965 --> 00:57:44,655
Blasted pump! Thought it was
leaking, so I put the tin there.

518
00:57:44,774 --> 00:57:46,870
It's half full already.

519
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:50,912
The washer's crumbling - if I try
tightening it up it may break up.

520
00:57:50,952 --> 00:57:53,233
What happens then?

521
00:57:53,273 --> 00:57:56,773
No washer, no pump, no engine,
nothing.

522
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,470
Rock. We'll have to start again
somewhere else.

523
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:21,315
Solid rock, sir? >

524
00:58:21,355 --> 00:58:24,161
No, it's a layer. Pretty thick one.

525
00:58:28,334 --> 00:58:31,100
Here, give me that thing.

526
00:58:54,996 --> 00:58:59,287
I'll carry on, now
- the rest'll be easy.

527
00:59:23,281 --> 00:59:28,243
You haven't got an indelible pencil
or anything like that, have you?

528
00:59:28,283 --> 00:59:29,701
No.

529
00:59:29,741 --> 00:59:31,919
I've got a pen, sir.

530
00:59:31,959 --> 00:59:35,645
What about my lipstick?
It's meant to be waterproof.

531
00:59:35,685 --> 00:59:37,512
It'll do fine.

532
01:00:27,088 --> 01:00:31,937
"The Lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want. "

533
01:00:32,147 --> 01:00:36,040
"He maketh me lie down
in green pastures. "

534
01:00:36,246 --> 01:00:39,749
"He leadeth me
beside the still waters. "

535
01:00:39,789 --> 01:00:41,228
"Yea,...

536
01:00:41,484 --> 01:00:46,162
.. though I walk through
the shadow of the valley of death...

537
01:00:47,813 --> 01:00:52,571
.. I shall... I will fear no evil. "

538
01:00:55,445 --> 01:00:57,972
"Thou preparest a table for me...

539
01:00:58,143 --> 01:01:00,738
.. in the presence of my enemies. "

540
01:01:21,305 --> 01:01:22,944
Vortreten!

541
01:01:25,072 --> 01:01:27,018
Nur einer vortreten!

542
01:01:27,525 --> 01:01:29,892
He wants only one of us.

543
01:01:35,453 --> 01:01:37,434
Vorwaerts, schnell!

544
01:01:37,911 --> 01:01:40,267
Schnell, komm schnell.

545
01:01:45,245 --> 01:01:48,159
Halt. Nehme die Waffen ab.

546
01:01:51,199 --> 01:01:53,988
We won't get away with it this time.

547
01:01:58,819 --> 01:02:00,754
Lass mal sehen!

548
01:02:11,742 --> 01:02:13,825
Ihr beide, mitkommen.

549
01:02:26,116 --> 01:02:27,703
Nehmt ihnen die Waffen weg!

550
01:02:27,743 --> 01:02:30,128
We must give up our guns.

551
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:35,054
I told you, they're funny
about armed troops on ambulances.

552
01:02:38,272 --> 01:02:39,888
Komm!

553
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:42,478
I've got some bad news
- Tobruk's fallen.

554
01:02:42,518 --> 01:02:44,823
I don't believe it.

555
01:02:44,824 --> 01:02:49,035
He doesn't believe us, and
it's up to him what happens next.

556
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:53,650
He can't call his HQ for orders
- they've got wireless silence.

557
01:02:55,053 --> 01:02:57,147
Schreiben Sie das auf.

558
01:02:57,148 --> 01:03:01,106
Gehen! Wir bringen keine Frauen
auf das Schlachtfeld.

559
01:03:01,146 --> 01:03:03,251
Sie sollten das auch nicht.

560
01:03:03,291 --> 01:03:08,042
He says to go, that they
don't bring women into battle...

561
01:03:08,082 --> 01:03:10,489
.. and we shouldn't either.

562
01:03:16,435 --> 01:03:18,974
He says to go further south.

563
01:03:19,153 --> 01:03:23,570
They're through to Maddalena, and
will cut off Mersa Matruh in days.

564
01:03:23,610 --> 01:03:26,143
I don't believe a ruddy word.

565
01:03:26,183 --> 01:03:29,091
He says we must start straight away.

566
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:35,657
All right, let's get going.
What the hell are we waiting for?

567
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,069
Well, you got us out of another jam.

568
01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:27,996
I don't know how - he was a bastard.

569
01:04:28,036 --> 01:04:30,955
With Tobruk gone,
they've more to do than round us up.

570
01:04:30,996 --> 01:04:33,391
I don't believe Tobruk's gone.

571
01:04:33,566 --> 01:04:35,962
Anyway, it looked as if
you were telling him what to do.

572
01:04:36,002 --> 01:04:38,898
It's the only way with bloody Nazis.

573
01:04:39,102 --> 01:04:42,643
Kick 'em in the guts
before they kick you.

574
01:04:42,814 --> 01:04:46,092
Tom, in case that young Jerry
was right,...

575
01:04:46,232 --> 01:04:49,618
.. we should go for the Garawla track

576
01:04:49,658 --> 01:04:51,946
That'll take three days, sir
- what about the pump?

577
01:04:51,986 --> 01:04:54,174
What's the water situation?

578
01:04:54,214 --> 01:04:56,020
About 14 gallons, sir.

579
01:04:56,060 --> 01:04:58,738
The pump'll use nine or ten.

580
01:04:58,778 --> 01:05:00,484
That doesn't leave much for us.

581
01:05:00,524 --> 01:05:05,641
Bir Beyli's 15 miles south, sir. We
can find water for the pump there.

582
01:05:05,846 --> 01:05:10,148
I hadn't thought of that
- let's see the map.

583
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:19,052
There she is - Bir Beyli.

584
01:05:36,637 --> 01:05:41,527
Well, we've dug it out before.
I suppose we can do it again.

585
01:05:41,567 --> 01:05:42,808
How far down's the water?

586
01:05:42,848 --> 01:05:45,165
Five, ten, fifteen feet.

587
01:05:45,287 --> 01:05:47,631
We dig to find out.

588
01:05:48,263 --> 01:05:52,543
Tom, we'll go down in one corner
and see if it gets damp.

589
01:05:58,975 --> 01:06:01,537
Here, take a mouthful.

590
01:06:01,668 --> 01:06:04,308
Rinse it round and spit it out.

591
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:08,441
Don't swallow,
it'll make you thirstier than ever.

592
01:06:26,435 --> 01:06:29,315
Scarcely damp and as salty as hell.

593
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:36,517
We ought to talk this thing over.

594
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:42,720
Look, we can go on trying
to dig this ruddy thing out...

595
01:06:42,760 --> 01:06:47,076
- heaven knows how long it'll take,
and we may not find water.

596
01:06:47,117 --> 01:06:49,956
We'll be using up what we've got.

597
01:06:49,996 --> 01:06:52,665
We have three alternatives - look.

598
01:06:52,900 --> 01:06:56,896
First, we can cut straight up
to Mersa Matruh.

599
01:06:56,937 --> 01:07:00,619
If Jerry's right,
they're going to be there first

600
01:07:01,001 --> 01:07:06,317
Or we can take the longer but safer
camel route round the Depression,...

601
01:07:06,470 --> 01:07:09,327
.. and then cut up the Garawla track.

602
01:07:09,531 --> 01:07:16,043
It's 270 miles, almost three days,
and we may be damned short of water.

603
01:07:16,251 --> 01:07:19,394
What's the third alternative?

604
01:07:19,434 --> 01:07:24,300
Well, the third alternative
is straight down to the Qara oasis.

605
01:07:24,431 --> 01:07:27,579
There's a dump the desert group uses

606
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:34,513
We fill up with water and petrol
and cut through the Depression.

607
01:07:34,553 --> 01:07:37,024
The Depression, sir?

608
01:07:37,064 --> 01:07:39,270
I haven't made an improper
suggestion! We've done it before.

609
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:41,775
I know, sir, but that was training.

610
01:07:42,312 --> 01:07:46,543
We'd light stuff
- and aircraft to look after us.

611
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:48,967
In this crate, we'd never do it.

612
01:07:49,007 --> 01:07:50,695
Remember that jeep,
went down like a submarine?

613
01:07:50,735 --> 01:07:52,927
Of course I remember.

614
01:07:53,095 --> 01:07:55,520
What is the Depression?

615
01:07:55,560 --> 01:07:58,096
A salt marsh below sea level.

616
01:07:58,136 --> 01:08:02,138
About 200 miles long, hot,
and Katy'd boil all the way.

617
01:08:02,178 --> 01:08:06,635
Liquid, with a dried crust on top
rather like a mouldy rice pudding.

618
01:08:06,778 --> 01:08:09,031
There is a track of sorts...

619
01:08:09,208 --> 01:08:13,215
.. but as Tom says,
if you do go through, well,...

620
01:08:13,255 --> 01:08:15,940
.. you've pretty well bought it.

621
01:08:15,980 --> 01:08:18,557
Katy does weigh two tons, remember.

622
01:08:18,688 --> 01:08:20,577
So what?

623
01:08:21,947 --> 01:08:24,645
Well, there are the alternatives.

624
01:08:25,258 --> 01:08:27,720
What's it to be?

625
01:08:27,760 --> 01:08:31,226
The Garawla Track, sir.
I'll keep the pump going.

626
01:08:31,393 --> 01:08:36,197
I agree with him. The Depression
isn't an alternative.

627
01:08:38,663 --> 01:08:41,553
Okay, the Garawla Track it is.

628
01:08:45,444 --> 01:08:46,935
Bones.

629
01:08:47,337 --> 01:08:50,068
Ran out of water, I suppose.

630
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:06,130
STOP, SIR, A SPRING'S GONE!

631
01:09:06,170 --> 01:09:08,076
Pull up, man.

632
01:09:20,794 --> 01:09:24,141
Be sure and make them
absolutely firm, sir.

633
01:09:24,362 --> 01:09:27,247
They'll have to take all the weight
when I pull the jack out.

634
01:09:27,287 --> 01:09:30,134
Why mess about with stones?

635
01:09:30,174 --> 01:09:30,741
Can't we just hold it on the jack?

636
01:09:30,781 --> 01:09:33,600
No, sir, we should have two jacks.

637
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:39,440
We've only got one - do it this way
to ease the new spring in position.

638
01:09:48,769 --> 01:09:53,050
Right, stand clear, sir,
I'm going to let her down.

639
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:00,416
Look out!

640
01:10:01,776 --> 01:10:07,149
Hold her for a moment! Just one
second, sir! Go on, hold her, sir!

641
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:09,119
Hold her, sir.

642
01:10:13,768 --> 01:10:15,498
Hold her!

643
01:11:18,482 --> 01:11:23,218
That's the most wonderful
bloody effort you'll ever see.

644
01:11:23,409 --> 01:11:26,084
He must have taken all of a ton
on his back.

645
01:11:26,124 --> 01:11:27,201
Get me the water bottle.

646
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:28,339
Right.

647
01:11:28,593 --> 01:11:34,371
If he hadn't held her
she'd have smashed her back axle.

648
01:11:34,411 --> 01:11:37,481
We'd have just kept on walking
till our water ran out.

649
01:11:37,521 --> 01:11:39,245
Here.

650
01:11:45,496 --> 01:11:48,149
Let's get him into the shade.

651
01:11:48,435 --> 01:11:49,880
I'll get a stretcher.

652
01:11:49,881 --> 01:11:54,765
No, don't need a stretcher. Give
me a pull up. I'll be all right.

653
01:11:55,053 --> 01:11:57,694
Take it easy,... easy.

654
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,179
Look out - Aircraft!

655
01:12:10,842 --> 01:12:13,711
It's all right, it's one of ours.

656
01:12:30,870 --> 01:12:34,512
"Jerry's advanced
beyond Sidi Barrani. "

657
01:12:34,513 --> 01:12:38,141
"Our troops falling back
to Alamein. "

658
01:12:38,181 --> 01:12:42,000
"Do not, repeat, not
attempt coast west of Darba. "

659
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:46,508
Darba? I can't believe it.
It's only 100 miles from Alex.

660
01:12:46,754 --> 01:12:48,038
That means Jerry's ahead.

661
01:12:48,078 --> 01:12:49,848
That means Jerry's ahead.
What now?

662
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:55,669
Unless you want to spend the war in
a prison camp, as I said earlier...

663
01:12:55,709 --> 01:12:59,904
- south to the Qara oasis
and the Depression. Any objections?

664
01:13:00,061 --> 01:13:02,212
Good, carried unanimously.

665
01:13:03,525 --> 01:13:07,247
And tomorrow, when we're
bogged down to the axles,...

666
01:13:07,811 --> 01:13:12,695
.. the water's gone, and we're alone
in 1,000 sq miles of mud,...

667
01:13:12,819 --> 01:13:15,512
.. you can all spit in my eye.

668
01:13:15,552 --> 01:13:20,407
All right, Tom, let's get going
- we don't want to be here all day.

669
01:13:20,603 --> 01:13:23,339
Would you like to go in the back?

670
01:13:23,379 --> 01:13:28,405
No, no thanks. I... I feel better
now, but I'd like a drink, though.

671
01:13:28,553 --> 01:13:31,058
Huh! A real drink.

672
01:13:31,213 --> 01:13:33,136
I'll get it.

673
01:13:54,234 --> 01:13:56,169
NO! I'LL DO IT!

674
01:13:56,295 --> 01:13:58,252
Thanks very much.

675
01:13:58,507 --> 01:14:00,453
You like some? No?

676
01:14:00,586 --> 01:14:02,077
Hah!

677
01:14:36,799 --> 01:14:38,810
Bang on time.

678
01:14:38,850 --> 01:14:41,341
Very regular habits.

679
01:14:41,381 --> 01:14:44,585
This afternoon,
when I got van der Poel his pack...

680
01:14:44,837 --> 01:14:48,331
.. it was heavy, too heavy
for a few bottles of gin.

681
01:14:48,544 --> 01:14:52,602
When I tried to open it for him,
he wouldn't let me.

682
01:14:52,642 --> 01:14:58,184
Listen, you've both from time to
time complained about van der Poel.

683
01:14:58,224 --> 01:15:02,327
Here's a chance to get it
off your chest... well, Tom?

684
01:15:02,513 --> 01:15:06,737
He's phoney, sir, hasn't a clue
how to make the fire,...

685
01:15:06,777 --> 01:15:09,640
.. yet S African troops
brew up as we do.

686
01:15:09,831 --> 01:15:14,852
And, why... why does he always go
to the latrine at the same time?

687
01:15:14,892 --> 01:15:17,493
Perhaps he's well brought up.

688
01:15:17,656 --> 01:15:19,307
Diana?

689
01:15:19,347 --> 01:15:24,088
I agree with Tom. I never liked
the man, but it's more than that.

690
01:15:24,335 --> 01:15:26,850
There is something phoney.

691
01:15:28,643 --> 01:15:31,087
Where are you going?

692
01:15:31,127 --> 01:15:33,785
Just for a walk, sir.

693
01:17:30,667 --> 01:17:30,969
Well?

694
01:17:31,009 --> 01:17:34,259
I saw something, for a second
- the light was bad -...

695
01:17:34,799 --> 01:17:37,712
.. but it was like a wireless mast.

696
01:17:37,752 --> 01:17:39,176
Are you sure of that?

697
01:17:39,216 --> 01:17:45,287
No, I'm not sure, but, well,
he certainly didn't use the spade.

698
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:48,007
Maybe he changed his mind.

699
01:17:48,505 --> 01:17:51,401
Maybe you're right and he is a spy.

700
01:17:51,441 --> 01:17:55,687
What do we do? Knock him over the
head and leave him with his gin?

701
01:17:55,727 --> 01:17:58,968
If he has a wireless, we must stop
him transmitting to the Germans.

702
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:01,345
What information has he got?

703
01:18:01,385 --> 01:18:01,942
Why risk using it every night?

704
01:18:01,982 --> 01:18:04,777
To keep in touch with his HQ.

705
01:18:04,817 --> 01:18:10,752
He may need to get through quickly,
assuming he is a spy and he has a transmitter.

706
01:18:10,792 --> 01:18:14,759
Remember, he saved us once,
and we may need him again.

707
01:18:14,951 --> 01:18:17,640
Let's leave it for the moment.

708
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:20,490
Could do with a shave,
couldn't you, Tom?

709
01:18:20,530 --> 01:18:22,277
Yes, sir.

710
01:18:40,998 --> 01:18:47,386
We'll push on a bit further before
it's dark - your turn in the back.

711
01:18:47,426 --> 01:18:48,888
Okay.

712
01:19:17,773 --> 01:19:21,415
We'll find out at Qara
- meanwhile, forget it. >

713
01:19:23,183 --> 01:19:25,597
Okay, Tom, I'll see about the tin. >

714
01:19:33,175 --> 01:19:36,088
We're stopping here for the night.

715
01:19:36,385 --> 01:19:39,219
Are the British at Qara oasis?

716
01:19:39,398 --> 01:19:42,820
We won't get there
till tomorrow afternoon.

717
01:19:42,860 --> 01:19:46,412
By that time we're just as likely
to find Jerry there.

718
01:19:46,452 --> 01:19:51,352
Yeah, at the rate they're going,
anything could happen.

719
01:20:01,373 --> 01:20:04,604
There you are - Qara oasis.

720
01:20:04,644 --> 01:20:07,552
Now we can get water and petrol.

721
01:20:24,082 --> 01:20:27,542
Doesn't seem to be anybody about,
sir.

722
01:20:27,728 --> 01:20:31,022
I'll scout around a bit, Tom.
You watch the ambulance.

723
01:20:31,062 --> 01:20:32,331
Right, sir.

724
01:20:51,030 --> 01:20:52,965
Moya, moya.

725
01:20:53,427 --> 01:20:55,942
Khamsa. Khamsa moya.

726
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:58,336
OOLA E GEHEENA!

727
01:20:59,215 --> 01:21:01,947
English, okay,... English.

728
01:21:02,116 --> 01:21:04,985
A teesh em taheena. Ra ha feen?

729
01:21:05,183 --> 01:21:11,706
We come from Tobruk - go, er... go
Alexandria. We want water, petrol.

730
01:21:11,839 --> 01:21:14,382
Ha de mush tareek. >

731
01:21:14,422 --> 01:21:19,757
Listen, we want water, petrol.
See, money. How much you want?

732
01:21:19,797 --> 01:21:22,468
Ma tesh tun nesh!

733
01:21:22,508 --> 01:21:23,054
The clot doesn't understand English.

734
01:21:23,094 --> 01:21:26,058
The clot doesn't understand English.
Sorry, had to make sure.

735
01:21:26,098 --> 01:21:27,055
This clot had difficulty
with your Arabic!

736
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:28,055
Good God! Who are you?

737
01:21:28,095 --> 01:21:30,450
Just stooging around, old boy.

738
01:21:30,490 --> 01:21:31,931
May I see your papers, please?

739
01:21:31,971 --> 01:21:33,068
You belong to the garrison?

740
01:21:33,108 --> 01:21:35,439
They went this morning.

741
01:21:35,479 --> 01:21:40,479
The Germans are coming - I'm here to
help them by sugaring the petrol!

742
01:21:40,519 --> 01:21:42,078
For Pete's sake let's have some
before you do it.

743
01:21:42,118 --> 01:21:44,272
How will you get away?

744
01:21:44,312 --> 01:21:47,116
The Germans'll be here in 3 hrs
and they're ahead along the coast.

745
01:21:47,156 --> 01:21:48,800
Across the Depression.

746
01:21:49,062 --> 01:21:50,080
- In that crate?
- Uh-huh.

747
01:21:50,120 --> 01:21:52,953
I suppose it is your only chance!

748
01:21:52,993 --> 01:21:54,135
Want a lift?

749
01:21:54,175 --> 01:21:56,796
Unfortunately I've an engagement.

750
01:21:56,836 --> 01:21:59,130
Let's see to that petrol.

751
01:21:59,383 --> 01:22:05,644
Pity it's late. You won't get far tonight
I shouldn't drive in the dark.

752
01:22:24,090 --> 01:22:27,038
Ladies and gents, the camel road...

753
01:22:27,384 --> 01:22:32,063
.. which everyone since Alexander
the Great has taken to Alex.

754
01:23:03,161 --> 01:23:06,860
You'll have to stop, sir,
she's boiling.

755
01:23:28,020 --> 01:23:29,977
Quick!

756
01:23:32,522 --> 01:23:34,878
Give me a hand, sir.

757
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:52,888
Go on, give him some more.

758
01:23:53,073 --> 01:23:55,862
What the hell? He's a brave man.

759
01:24:28,206 --> 01:24:31,790
Not again, man
- this is the sixth time.

760
01:24:31,830 --> 01:24:34,818
It's not the radiator.
The light's going.

761
01:24:34,859 --> 01:24:37,071
Surely you can do
another couple of miles?

762
01:24:37,111 --> 01:24:39,917
I won't risk it in the dark.

763
01:24:43,182 --> 01:24:44,951
Sorry I folded up on you.

764
01:24:44,991 --> 01:24:45,589
There you are, sir.

765
01:24:45,629 --> 01:24:47,261
Thanks, Tom.

766
01:24:47,301 --> 01:24:48,792
Feel better now?

767
01:24:48,832 --> 01:24:54,735
Apart from a splitting headache
and a mouth like a parrot cage, I'm fine, thanks.

768
01:24:56,028 --> 01:25:01,686
Wish we'd gone a bit further - it's
the lowest part of the whole issue.

769
01:25:01,832 --> 01:25:03,827
I dunno - looks pretty firm to me.

770
01:25:03,867 --> 01:25:07,265
Well, it isn't
- we're on top of a ruddy jelly.

771
01:25:07,429 --> 01:25:09,286
We'll be lucky she doesn't bog down
in the night.

772
01:25:09,326 --> 01:25:12,210
She's on sand mats, sir, in case.

773
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:16,635
Listen, nobody move a foot
off the tracks - understand?

774
01:25:16,675 --> 01:25:19,140
Okay.

775
01:25:35,981 --> 01:25:37,950
Douse the fire.

776
01:25:38,076 --> 01:25:39,255
What are you going to do?

777
01:25:39,295 --> 01:25:43,957
If he's a spy, he'll signal tonight
about our chaps at the oasis.

778
01:25:44,151 --> 01:25:49,444
We'll try and catch our South
African friend with his pants down.

779
01:25:57,313 --> 01:26:01,279
He can't be far along the track.
Uncover the lamps.

780
01:26:01,319 --> 01:26:05,480
Get in the cab, Tom, and when
I give the signal, switch on.

781
01:26:11,026 --> 01:26:12,574
Now I.

782
01:26:19,413 --> 01:26:22,771
Over to the left, Tom.
Turn out the lights.

783
01:26:35,673 --> 01:26:37,312
Switch on.

784
01:26:40,264 --> 01:26:42,574
Over to the right.

785
01:26:43,658 --> 01:26:45,911
Go back, Tom.

786
01:26:51,641 --> 01:26:53,883
Hard down right.

787
01:26:56,668 --> 01:26:59,207
Hard over left.

788
01:27:06,659 --> 01:27:08,685
Now forward.

789
01:27:08,871 --> 01:27:11,444
Stop - hard down right.

790
01:27:12,648 --> 01:27:14,947
Hard over left.

791
01:27:17,660 --> 01:27:19,288
Stop.

792
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:21,426
Hard down right.

793
01:27:28,265 --> 01:27:30,211
Now forward.

794
01:27:49,288 --> 01:27:51,439
I'm trapped!

795
01:27:53,149 --> 01:27:57,111
Tom, quick, he's in trouble,
get the sand mats.

796
01:28:02,295 --> 01:28:04,594
Another mat, quick.

797
01:28:07,700 --> 01:28:10,205
Get the tow rope.

798
01:28:58,381 --> 01:29:02,174
Give me something else
- a shirt, anything.

799
01:29:02,214 --> 01:29:04,473
Hold on, hold on.

800
01:29:04,733 --> 01:29:07,060
Throw it, man.

801
01:29:07,101 --> 01:29:10,885
Throw it, hurry,
I'm being sucked under.

802
01:29:11,652 --> 01:29:13,986
Grab hold, grab hold.

803
01:29:14,282 --> 01:29:16,353
Pull. Pull.

804
01:29:16,742 --> 01:29:18,780
Hang on, man.

805
01:29:19,652 --> 01:29:21,177
Pull!

806
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:32,129
Aaargh!

807
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:34,829
Hurry!

808
01:29:47,068 --> 01:29:48,980
Get the ambulance.

809
01:29:49,640 --> 01:29:52,236
I'm gone. I can't stop.

810
01:29:56,760 --> 01:29:59,104
For God's sake...

811
01:30:00,047 --> 01:30:02,004
Diana?

812
01:30:04,011 --> 01:30:04,966
Get in!

813
01:30:05,006 --> 01:30:06,798
Get in!
I can't drive.

814
01:30:07,055 --> 01:30:10,868
When I signal,
let the clutch out gently.

815
01:30:53,689 --> 01:30:56,478
You go round the other side.

816
01:31:23,829 --> 01:31:25,775
That's enough.

817
01:31:26,475 --> 01:31:31,245
Get water, gin.
There's some in his other pack.

818
01:31:46,928 --> 01:31:49,284
Give him a drink.

819
01:31:59,957 --> 01:32:03,554
He's unconscious,
but he'll be all right.

820
01:32:03,794 --> 01:32:07,528
You saw what was in his pack?
He is a Nazi.

821
01:32:09,489 --> 01:32:14,384
Diana, get in the ambulance. We'll
bring him round, you clean him up.

822
01:32:14,616 --> 01:32:17,360
Use petrol, we can't spare water.

823
01:32:42,455 --> 01:32:44,316
How is he?

824
01:32:44,356 --> 01:32:47,253
Exhausted. I gave him a sedative.

825
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:50,408
This didn't do the track much good.

826
01:32:51,433 --> 01:32:54,188
Let's get out of here quickly.

827
01:33:23,336 --> 01:33:27,638
We'll soon need another halt, sir,
or she'll boil again.

828
01:33:39,354 --> 01:33:43,634
Tom, can't we get on?
She must be cool by now. >

829
01:33:43,845 --> 01:33:47,544
We'll have to leave her
a bit longer, sir. >

830
01:33:57,966 --> 01:34:02,106
I... I want to say something
about last night.

831
01:34:02,146 --> 01:34:04,064
I want to apologise.

832
01:34:04,236 --> 01:34:08,595
I should've done like you told me,
stuck to the track.

833
01:34:08,808 --> 01:34:12,440
Skip it.
Afraid you lost your shirt, though.

834
01:34:15,528 --> 01:34:17,485
And your pack.

835
01:34:22,344 --> 01:34:24,267
Why did you do it?

836
01:34:24,411 --> 01:34:26,192
Do what?

837
01:34:26,232 --> 01:34:28,104
Turn on the headlamps.

838
01:34:28,302 --> 01:34:31,785
Heard a noise,
thought you might have gone in.

839
01:34:32,019 --> 01:34:34,557
Weren't far wrong, were we?

840
01:34:34,695 --> 01:34:36,118
No,...

841
01:34:36,336 --> 01:34:38,477
.. no, you weren't.

842
01:34:38,682 --> 01:34:40,469
Thanks.

843
01:34:40,768 --> 01:34:43,323
You'll be able to dine out on this
story for weeks, won't he, Tom?

844
01:34:43,363 --> 01:34:45,087
Certainly will, sir.

845
01:34:45,291 --> 01:34:48,079
I'll go and top her up now, sir.

846
01:34:49,380 --> 01:34:52,827
How much further
till we get out of this?

847
01:34:52,867 --> 01:34:53,935
Oh, about another 80 miles.

848
01:34:53,975 --> 01:34:54,617
Shall we get out tonight?

849
01:34:54,657 --> 01:34:57,393
No, we're through the worst, though.

850
01:34:57,433 --> 01:35:00,330
Well, let's get started, shall we?

851
01:35:16,713 --> 01:35:19,593
What are you going to do about him?

852
01:35:19,776 --> 01:35:23,384
Nothing, yet.
He thinks he's safe with us.

853
01:35:24,903 --> 01:35:29,525
We'll let him go on thinking that,
for the moment.

854
01:35:53,378 --> 01:35:55,324
Man, this heat.

855
01:35:55,524 --> 01:35:57,174
Yeah.

856
01:36:00,115 --> 01:36:03,793
Doesn't seem to bother old Tom much,
does it?

857
01:36:03,973 --> 01:36:05,521
Well,...

858
01:36:05,952 --> 01:36:07,773
.. this time tomorrow...

859
01:36:07,948 --> 01:36:11,420
...our little party
will have broken up.

860
01:36:29,892 --> 01:36:33,956
What's the first thing you'll do
when you get to Alex?

861
01:36:34,094 --> 01:36:36,143
Told you - that beer.

862
01:36:36,339 --> 01:36:42,327
It's so ruddy cold there's a sort
of dew on the outside of the glass.

863
01:36:42,328 --> 01:36:43,865
And then?

864
01:36:44,063 --> 01:36:50,085
Then I'll pull the chain six times
just for the sound of running water.

865
01:36:54,004 --> 01:36:56,520
Someone waiting for you?

866
01:36:57,175 --> 01:36:58,939
Well, it's...

867
01:36:59,642 --> 01:37:02,262
.. it's all rather complicated.

868
01:37:02,302 --> 01:37:03,787
Tell me.

869
01:37:05,172 --> 01:37:08,773
Paul Crosbie,
a character in my unit,...

870
01:37:08,813 --> 01:37:11,323
.. we took our leaves together,...

871
01:37:11,484 --> 01:37:13,601
.. and in Alex last time...

872
01:37:14,649 --> 01:37:17,380
.. we got caught up with somebody.

873
01:37:18,519 --> 01:37:20,454
What's her name?

874
01:37:21,497 --> 01:37:23,068
Ariadne.

875
01:37:24,208 --> 01:37:27,144
And you're both in love with her?

876
01:37:27,301 --> 01:37:29,817
That seemed to be the idea.

877
01:37:30,029 --> 01:37:31,941
Where is he now?

878
01:37:32,075 --> 01:37:35,194
Paul? In the bag, I'm afraid.

879
01:37:35,418 --> 01:37:38,913
One of us had to stay behind
in Tobruk.

880
01:37:39,726 --> 01:37:43,596
I'd no choice
- he thought I was ratting on him.

881
01:37:44,699 --> 01:37:48,832
Now you think
you might have an unfair advantage?

882
01:37:49,141 --> 01:37:51,736
What do you think?

883
01:37:54,695 --> 01:37:58,189
I think you don't understand women.

884
01:38:00,568 --> 01:38:02,264
I don't.

885
01:38:02,833 --> 01:38:05,247
She'll know what she wants.

886
01:38:05,408 --> 01:38:10,348
If it's Paul, nothing you do
will make the slightest difference.

887
01:38:10,548 --> 01:38:14,782
And if it's you,
I think you should know by now.

888
01:38:17,916 --> 01:38:24,770
Like a judge's summing up
- sound, logical, cold as hell...

889
01:38:25,700 --> 01:38:27,919
.. and probably right.

890
01:38:31,170 --> 01:38:33,496
Do you always know what you want?

891
01:38:33,536 --> 01:38:36,217
Always.

892
01:38:56,914 --> 01:38:59,874
We'll be on top in a few minutes.

893
01:39:00,091 --> 01:39:03,062
The track up is just over there.

894
01:39:21,970 --> 01:39:24,641
What's the matter?

895
01:39:24,681 --> 01:39:28,398
This slope -
the wind's blown sand all over it.

896
01:39:28,438 --> 01:39:28,997
We'll have trouble getting her up.

897
01:39:29,037 --> 01:39:33,101
If we don't do it, we'll be
stuck like ants in a jam pot.

898
01:39:33,141 --> 01:39:33,938
Isn't there any other way?

899
01:39:33,978 --> 01:39:35,907
'Fraid not.

900
01:39:36,033 --> 01:39:38,113
Let's try to belt her up it, Tom.

901
01:39:38,153 --> 01:39:38,762
Right, sir.

902
01:39:38,802 --> 01:39:41,516
I'll signal. Come on, you two.

903
01:39:51,951 --> 01:39:53,522
Okay,...

904
01:39:53,931 --> 01:39:57,915
.. she should be going well by here.
We can give her a shove if needed.

905
01:39:58,153 --> 01:40:02,315
Man, she hasn't a chance
on this sand. She'll bog down.

906
01:40:02,355 --> 01:40:05,912
Not if we do what I say. TOM? TOM?

907
01:40:15,038 --> 01:40:19,569
There, what did I tell you?
Like a ruddy dose of salts.

908
01:40:38,818 --> 01:40:40,707
Hold her!

909
01:40:42,213 --> 01:40:46,014
What did you expect, man,
on this slope! >

910
01:40:46,054 --> 01:40:48,734
It's madness - we'll never get up.

911
01:41:01,741 --> 01:41:04,617
We'll take her up on the mats,
6ft at a time. You start digging.

912
01:41:04,657 --> 01:41:06,757
You've got the spade.

913
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:09,635
We've only got one. Use your hands.

914
01:41:12,019 --> 01:41:14,915
You know what's going to happen?

915
01:41:14,955 --> 01:41:18,934
We're going to stick halfway
and won't get her up or down.

916
01:41:19,055 --> 01:41:21,433
Get out I Out of it I

917
01:41:30,527 --> 01:41:35,570
Don't stand there like a Hyde Park
floosie - round the back and push!

918
01:41:35,571 --> 01:41:40,394
You stop grinning about your
love life - come and help.

919
01:41:40,434 --> 01:41:42,423
Get cracking, Tom!

920
01:41:42,463 --> 01:41:43,925
Come on!

921
01:41:47,379 --> 01:41:51,591
Shove, damn you - don't
lean against the bloody thing.

922
01:41:51,754 --> 01:41:56,387
Never mind your ruddy make-up.
Get up - push!

923
01:42:06,045 --> 01:42:08,346
It's no good, sir.

924
01:42:08,386 --> 01:42:12,312
No good? You're a fine one
to talk, riding all the way.

925
01:42:12,352 --> 01:42:16,991
You told me to drive, sir. The
engine's boiling over, it's heating.

926
01:42:17,136 --> 01:42:19,902
A seized engine won't get us to Alex

927
01:42:21,072 --> 01:42:24,072
So you all want to walk, do you?

928
01:42:24,112 --> 01:42:26,667
All right, there's the compass.

929
01:42:26,707 --> 01:42:28,408
Take food and water,...

930
01:42:28,602 --> 01:42:32,665
.. keep on 30 degrees for two days
- and I hope it keeps fine for you.

931
01:42:32,705 --> 01:42:36,492
Who the hell are you talking to?
I've taken enough.

932
01:42:36,532 --> 01:42:38,108
You haven't taken half
you're going to, yet.

933
01:42:38,109 --> 01:42:41,808
Hold it - take it easy, gentlemen.

934
01:42:53,128 --> 01:42:58,023
I'm going to get Katy to Alex,
do you understand? I'm going to.

935
01:42:58,151 --> 01:43:00,701
It's a personal thing.

936
01:43:13,537 --> 01:43:15,472
Let him alone.

937
01:43:17,163 --> 01:43:20,501
There is a way we might get her up.

938
01:43:20,541 --> 01:43:23,631
Wind her up on the starting handle
with the plugs out,...

939
01:43:23,632 --> 01:43:25,521
.. in reverse, lowest gear.

940
01:43:25,662 --> 01:43:28,204
It's a long shot but it could work.

941
01:43:28,244 --> 01:43:33,146
In the reverse means you've got to
turn her round - she'll fall over.

942
01:43:33,186 --> 01:43:36,959
Not if we use our weight
- I'll show you.

943
01:43:46,353 --> 01:43:51,783
Down on the left. Take her down
on the left - she'll go this time.

944
01:43:51,907 --> 01:43:53,842
Go on, round with her.

945
01:43:55,151 --> 01:44:00,035
That's it, away you go. Hard round,
all she'll go, go on, round you go.

946
01:44:00,142 --> 01:44:02,704
Full lock, full lock, man.

947
01:44:24,176 --> 01:44:27,044
I've no idea what they're doing.

948
01:44:27,220 --> 01:44:32,259
They tried to explain to me but
I'm hopeless at that sort of thing.

949
01:44:32,299 --> 01:44:35,970
If you take the plugs out
there's no resistance.

950
01:44:36,152 --> 01:44:40,508
If you put her in low gear
and wind the starting handle,...

951
01:44:40,548 --> 01:44:43,351
.. the wheels turn very slowly.

952
01:44:43,391 --> 01:44:48,053
Because the movement's gradual,
the sand isn't disturbed...

953
01:44:48,241 --> 01:44:50,005
that's the theory.

954
01:44:57,589 --> 01:44:59,535
Come and help.

955
01:45:02,596 --> 01:45:06,295
All right,
I'll come and watch a miracle.

956
01:45:06,571 --> 01:45:08,893
Now, let's see.

957
01:45:11,445 --> 01:45:12,598
Brake off?

958
01:45:12,638 --> 01:45:14,305
Okay.

959
01:45:15,571 --> 01:45:16,150
Any movement?

960
01:45:16,190 --> 01:45:17,581
No.

961
01:45:17,621 --> 01:45:19,527
Nothing at all?

962
01:45:27,178 --> 01:45:28,931
It's working!

963
01:45:29,058 --> 01:45:30,993
Tom! It's working!

964
01:45:31,370 --> 01:45:32,952
It's working!

965
01:45:33,185 --> 01:45:39,195
Right - 500 turns each till we
get to the top. Right - here we go!

966
01:47:38,275 --> 01:47:40,916
Only another thirty feet, sir.

967
01:47:41,203 --> 01:47:44,174
Hold her there. I'll get my shirt.

968
01:47:46,891 --> 01:47:49,828
Come on - we're there!

969
01:48:08,059 --> 01:48:09,279
She's away!

970
01:48:09,319 --> 01:48:11,783
Stop it! Stop it!

971
01:48:18,061 --> 01:48:19,893
Oh, dear God.

972
01:49:57,412 --> 01:50:01,441
My fault - I should
have had somebody on the brake.

973
01:50:01,582 --> 01:50:04,599
That's your job next trip.

974
01:50:06,373 --> 01:50:10,289
Well, let's take a little exercise,
shall we?

975
01:50:14,307 --> 01:50:17,119
Come on, now. It's quite simple.

976
01:50:17,351 --> 01:50:24,454
When we say "brake" just pull hard on the brake
and the ratchet'll hold her. Right? Good.

977
01:50:38,772 --> 01:50:41,425
All right - Brake off!

978
01:51:22,268 --> 01:51:26,161
We're there. We made it.

979
01:51:26,374 --> 01:51:28,491
See that clear bit?

980
01:51:28,654 --> 01:51:31,568
That's the reflection of the sea.

981
01:51:32,528 --> 01:51:41,384
Right, van der Poel - it's your honour to bring her up
the last lap. Get cracking. Bar opens at six.

982
01:51:44,437 --> 01:51:47,533
# My old man said
follow the van

983
01:51:47,681 --> 01:51:51,187
# Don't dilly-dally on the way

984
01:51:51,408 --> 01:51:54,641
# Off went the van
with my home in it

985
01:51:54,925 --> 01:51:58,101
# I followed on
with me old cock linnet

986
01:51:58,294 --> 01:52:01,675
# But I dillied and dallied,
dallied and dillied

987
01:52:01,887 --> 01:52:05,006
# Lost the way
and don't know where to roam

988
01:52:05,346 --> 01:52:08,806
# Cos you can't trust the Specials
like the old-time coppers

989
01:52:09,049 --> 01:52:11,576
# When you can't find
your way home. #

990
01:52:26,403 --> 01:52:31,685
Do you want to see him
stuck up against a wall and shot?

991
01:52:34,470 --> 01:52:36,848
No, I don't.

992
01:52:39,209 --> 01:52:41,543
Well, he is a spy.

993
01:52:51,036 --> 01:52:51,450
Is your officer here, Sergeant?

994
01:52:51,490 --> 01:52:54,444
In the tent, sir.

995
01:52:54,484 --> 01:52:55,842
Identity card, Diana. Paybook, Tom.

996
01:52:55,882 --> 01:52:57,629
Right, sir.

997
01:52:57,822 --> 01:53:01,509
Nip in the back
and keep him company, will you?

998
01:53:01,549 --> 01:53:04,507
Tom, shouldn't we put the tin
under the radiator?

999
01:53:04,547 --> 01:53:09,868
That tin! Never again. You don't
know how I feel about that tin!

1000
01:53:28,459 --> 01:53:30,070
Captain Johnson - Sister Murdoch.

1001
01:53:30,111 --> 01:53:32,517
Pretty good show, Sister.

1002
01:53:32,557 --> 01:53:33,464
I expect you'd like
a wash and brush-up.

1003
01:53:33,504 --> 01:53:35,460
Thanks, we've got to push on.

1004
01:53:35,500 --> 01:53:37,541
- A drink?
- No, we've a date for that.

1005
01:53:37,721 --> 01:53:41,198
Okay. Hope the shirt fits
your chum - biggest I could find.

1006
01:53:41,238 --> 01:53:44,055
Thanks - I'll see you get it back.

1007
01:53:44,143 --> 01:53:45,657
Thanks.

1008
01:53:52,540 --> 01:53:57,219
Present from the military police
to Captain van der Poel.

1009
01:53:57,553 --> 01:54:02,304
Better take the pips off
before you give it to him.

1010
01:54:02,344 --> 01:54:03,886
I suppose you know
what you're doing?

1011
01:54:03,926 --> 01:54:06,496
This time, yes.

1012
01:54:06,536 --> 01:54:09,034
What about us?

1013
01:54:10,139 --> 01:54:14,431
We'll both go back to our units,
like I told you.

1014
01:54:14,914 --> 01:54:17,828
I'd like to be coming with you.

1015
01:54:19,516 --> 01:54:22,259
Too much of a handful.

1016
01:54:22,698 --> 01:54:25,522
You'll be coming back to Alex?

1017
01:54:25,562 --> 01:54:28,243
No, wouldn't work out.

1018
01:54:29,499 --> 01:54:32,412
I'd like to think it could,...

1019
01:54:33,523 --> 01:54:35,446
...but... it wouldn't.

1020
01:54:37,133 --> 01:54:39,729
Only make you unhappy.

1021
01:54:47,912 --> 01:54:49,972
See?

1022
01:54:50,012 --> 01:54:52,454
Started already!

1023
01:54:53,266 --> 01:54:56,214
You said you don't understand women.

1024
01:54:56,381 --> 01:54:59,591
You certainly don't understand me.

1025
01:55:01,368 --> 01:55:06,263
If you did, you'd realise
I don't give up so easily.

1026
01:55:10,615 --> 01:55:16,511
Better take the er... shirt
in to the captain.

1027
01:55:23,123 --> 01:55:24,337
What's that?

1028
01:55:24,377 --> 01:55:26,386
The other spring's gone.

1029
01:55:26,481 --> 01:55:27,726
Shall I pull up, sir?

1030
01:55:27,766 --> 01:55:32,655
What the hell! She's done 600 miles
- we've only four to go - bash on.

1031
01:55:52,528 --> 01:55:54,930
You good old cow!

1032
01:56:12,595 --> 01:56:14,204
Set 'em up, Joe.

1033
01:56:14,244 --> 01:56:15,923
Set what up?

1034
01:56:16,564 --> 01:56:19,967
Four ice-cold lagers.

1035
01:56:32,534 --> 01:56:36,034
Captain Anson. Where have you been?

1036
01:56:36,135 --> 01:56:38,135
Doing some merging. Come on, Joe,
let's have that beer, hmm?

1037
01:56:38,846 --> 01:56:40,346
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

1038
01:56:49,045 --> 01:56:50,545
You kept your promise.

1039
01:56:53,674 --> 01:56:56,246
Well, let's hope the beer's
what I said it was, eh?

1040
01:57:41,815 --> 01:57:43,815
Worth waiting for.

1041
01:57:44,780 --> 01:57:47,380
Come on. Drink up. You deserved it.
Four more, Joe.

1042
01:57:47,381 --> 01:57:49,381
Here's to you, men!

1043
01:57:50,544 --> 01:57:51,544
Good luck!

1044
01:58:14,346 --> 01:58:16,846
Sit down, over here. Stall. Quick.

1045
01:58:16,847 --> 01:58:18,847
Move on. Sit down. Sit down.

1046
01:58:19,537 --> 01:58:22,037
Come on man, drink up.
You're one behind.

1047
01:58:22,038 --> 01:58:23,038
Cigarette?

1048
01:58:23,826 --> 01:58:26,126
- Captain Anson.
- You're early.

1049
01:58:27,118 --> 01:58:31,118
Maybe. It's strictly forbidden
to fraternize with the enemy.

1050
01:58:42,401 --> 01:58:45,601
Fresh off the boat. Thinks - is the answer.

1051
01:58:48,599 --> 01:58:51,899
You obey orders, lieutenant. Wait outside
until the time I fixed with your CO.

1052
01:59:10,710 --> 01:59:13,900
I've phoned for them at the checkpoint.
We've only got a few minutes.

1053
01:59:15,031 --> 01:59:16,531
Now, what's your real name?

1054
01:59:18,132 --> 01:59:20,832
Look. I told security you're a German officer.

1055
01:59:20,833 --> 01:59:24,433
You got locked outside Tobruk.
We picked you up and you gave us your parole.

1056
01:59:24,434 --> 01:59:27,434
But the whole thing breaks down
if we don't know your real name.

1057
01:59:29,618 --> 01:59:32,318
Don't try to bluff it out now, man.
We've known for a long time.

1058
01:59:32,319 --> 01:59:34,819
We knew the first time you tried
to get us through your own people.

1059
01:59:34,820 --> 01:59:37,220
Once was a miracle, but twice  just wasn't on.

1060
01:59:38,142 --> 01:59:39,542
And that bloody grey bag of yours.

1061
01:59:39,543 --> 01:59:42,343
We knew it was a transmitter long before
it went down in the bog.

1062
01:59:42,344 --> 01:59:45,144
Now, come on. What's your real name?

1063
01:59:46,614 --> 01:59:48,545
My God, man, can't you see it's your last chance?

1064
01:59:49,498 --> 01:59:54,498
Why do you think I got rid of everything that
identified you as a South African? Stick to my story!

1065
01:59:58,973 --> 02:00:00,499
You know the alternative?

1066
02:00:02,138 --> 02:00:03,771
Do you want to be stuck up against a wall and shot?

1067
02:00:07,639 --> 02:00:09,039
Otto Lutz.

1068
02:00:10,861 --> 02:00:14,861
Hauptmann engineer. 21st Panzer group.

1069
02:00:22,514 --> 02:00:25,514
Well, here's to you, Otto.

1070
02:00:26,918 --> 02:00:29,515
We all know damn well we wouldn't be here
if it hadn't been for you.

1071
02:00:41,126 --> 02:00:42,426
It's 6:30, Captain Anson.

1072
02:00:52,194 --> 02:00:55,594
OK. But won't you fraternize
with us and have one for the road?

1073
02:00:56,194 --> 02:00:57,194
No, thank you.

1074
02:01:00,819 --> 02:01:02,819
You'll release me from my parole,
Herr Capitan?

1075
02:01:02,820 --> 02:01:03,820
Certainly.

1076
02:01:04,520 --> 02:01:05,520
Now, look.

1077
02:01:06,218 --> 02:01:10,218
I told your CO that Hauptmann looks at
The Hague in an exemplary manner.

1078
02:01:10,219 --> 02:01:12,719
So there's no need for a ball and chain.

1079
02:01:16,325 --> 02:01:18,325
First, will you shake hands with me, please?

1080
02:01:49,870 --> 02:01:50,955
Otto.

1081
02:01:52,154 --> 02:01:56,154
You, um, haven't finished your beer.

1082
02:02:31,439 --> 02:02:34,439
It has been quite an experience.

1083
02:02:37,254 --> 02:02:40,254
All against the desert. The greater enemy.

1084
02:02:43,755 --> 02:02:46,155
I've learned a lot about the English.

1085
02:02:47,481 --> 02:02:49,081
So different from all I've been taught.

1086
02:02:51,107 --> 02:02:52,682
Auf Weidersehen.
