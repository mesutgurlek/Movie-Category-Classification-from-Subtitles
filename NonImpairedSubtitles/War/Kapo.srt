1
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:31,415
-Finished.
-PIay the last few bars again.

2
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:43,498
-Was it better today, ma'am?
-Yes.

3
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,698
-When can I come again?
-Your mother said...

4
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,294
... you had to leave.
Aren't you?

5
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:52,497
Papa says there's no need.
We're quite safe in Paris.

6
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:55,538
The day after tomorrow
then, at 4 o'cIock.

7
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:58,692
-Goodbye, ma'am.
-Give my regards to your mother.

8
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,448
-I will. Goodbye.
-Go straight home.

9
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:25,020
Oh, how are you, ma'am?
She's just left.

10
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,738
I can try, but she walks so fast.

11
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,614
Yes, I'll go at once.

12
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,452
No, ma'am... HeIIo?

13
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:52,210
Hello?...

14
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:04,851
Come on! Quickly!

15
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:08,933
Out, or I'll shoot!

16
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,212
Stay here by me.
Don't go! Don't go!

17
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:20,578
Mama! Mama!

18
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,935
Edith!
Go away! Go away!

19
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:26,695
-Get on!
-You too!

20
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,211
Regional train number 4327.

21
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:29,691
Lead all the prisoners...

22
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:34,769
... to the main square!

23
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:42,291
Get off!

24
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:46,612
Come on!

25
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:52,854
Quickly!

26
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:59,296
Everyone off the train!

27
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:08,048
Mama! Mama!

28
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:12,611
Get out!

29
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:16,132
Come on!

30
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:20,213
Move!

31
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:23,690
Come down!

32
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:26,817
Hurry up!

33
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:02,931
Left!... Right!...
Left!... Right!...

34
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:42,291
Attention, pIease!

35
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:49,931
-No! Mama! No!
-Edith!

36
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,735
-Edith?
-Yes?

37
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,050
They'll kill us all
at daybreak.

38
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,291
-How do you know?
-I heard them.

39
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,814
I can speak German.

40
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,698
They'll kill the children
and the old people.

41
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,288
Two SS said that near me.

42
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:52,338
God, if only
I could see them again!

43
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:56,811
Shut up!

44
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:01,849
Stop yelling!

45
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:05,814
Come here!
Where are you going?

46
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:09,609
-Let's escape, Pierre!
-And go where?

47
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:14,697
I want to see my mother
and my father again.

48
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:18,409
The door's open.
You come too, let's go!

49
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,212
It's no good.

50
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,137
Hold him.

51
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:31,619
Goodbye, Pierre.

52
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,649
And who are you?
Where are you off to?

53
00:10:56,780 --> 00:11:00,693
-Let me come in, please!
-What, in here?

54
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,733
Don't send me away.
They want to kill me!

55
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:12,778
Quiet, stupid!

56
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,816
-You're Jewish?
-Yes.

57
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:17,016
Well then!

58
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:28,658
You won't need this
any more.

59
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,212
Come. Maybe we can both
be of some use to each other.

60
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:38,774
Hurry!

61
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:10,060
-What is it, Sofia?
-I brought you this one.

62
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:12,938
She arrived tonight. Jewish.
They've seIected her...

63
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:16,251
for the gas chamber but they
haven't registered her yet.

64
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,734
All right, Sofia. Go now.

65
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,129
All right my hat!
What do I get?

66
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:26,178
-I haven't even any bread.
-Give me some alcohol.

67
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:29,298
-No, it's bad for you.
-Who cares!

68
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:33,214
You're sick, Sofia. Go now, I'll
give you something next time.

69
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,815
My bIock's being transferred to
a labour camp. I leave tomorrow.

70
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,460
Bye, Doctor.

71
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:46,252
They say it's a good camp.
Try to get her into our convoy.

72
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,138
Remember, block 1 2

73
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,297
-How old are you?
-1 4.

74
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:00,296
-Are you here on your own?
-No,

75
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:03,417
with my mother and my father,
but they split us up.

76
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,295
Wait here.

77
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,498
You're in luck.
If no one had died tonight,

78
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,134
I couldn't have helped you.

79
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,095
Take your clothes off.
Quickly now.

80
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,819
I told you to strip off.

81
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,858
Everything, unless you want
them to spot you at once.

82
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:28,129
Hurry up!

83
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,448
Put this on. Come on!

84
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:50,251
Please yourself, but if you
want to live, you must put...

85
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,776
... this smock on, now.
We don't have much time.

86
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,290
Come on, hurry!

87
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,936
That black triangle on your
smock stands for criminals.

88
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:28,817
Political prisoners wear
a red triangle, like mine.

89
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,778
The Jews have a yeIIow star.

90
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:40,249
But black triangles
get the best treatment.

91
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,457
The SS pick them
as camp oversees.

92
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,135
They call them ''Kapo''.
Beware of them.

93
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:52,896
They're mean and they can do
what they like to the prisoners.

94
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:59,576
But you stand a better chance
with your black triangle.

95
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:03,457
You're taking the place
of a French thief.

96
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,175
I haven't reported her death.
Her name was NicoIe.

97
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:11,128
Number 10099.

98
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,534
You're name is Nicole now,
understand? Remember that.

99
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:25,818
Come on,
what's your name now?

100
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:28,937
-Nicole.
-Nicole Niepas.

101
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:33,293
-Nicole Niepas.
-Number 10099.

102
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:37,209
In German it's...

103
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:40,889
Remember that. And don't
show this for a few days.

104
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:43,938
Wait for it to heal.
I'll be right back.

105
00:16:44,020 --> 00:16:46,773
I have to see if I can get
you assigned to a hut.

106
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,932
Nicole's is out,
they'd be on to you at once.

107
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:14,418
Come here!

108
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,458
March!

109
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:21,530
Join the others!

110
00:17:21,620 --> 00:17:24,009
Come on!

111
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:30,578
One! Two! Three! Four!

112
00:17:30,820 --> 00:17:35,211
Attention, please!
All the Kapos...

113
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,971
... of the blocks number
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 appear...

114
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,736
before the Commander
for general roll call!

115
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,539
Come on! Move!

116
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:57,615
Mama! Mama!
No! No!

117
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:07,216
Mama! Mama!

118
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,135
Mama... Mama...!

119
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:52,853
You've got to live, Nicole,
and think of nothing else.

120
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:56,929
Just live, that's all. Come...

121
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,778
I managed to get you
assigned to block 1 2.

122
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,579
That's where Sofia is, the
girl who brought you here.

123
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,292
Block 1 2. The number is
on the hut, you can't miss it.

124
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,659
Tomorrow you'll leave
for a labour camp.

125
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:16,413
It's better than this.
Nobody will know you.

126
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:20,015
Your name is NicoIe,
always remember that.

127
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:25,655
If they ask anything, say
you left the infirmary today.

128
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:30,653
You're not Jewish any more,
understand?

129
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:34,978
You hear me, Nicole?

130
00:19:35,060 --> 00:19:37,699
Off you go.

131
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,692
It's up to you now.
Try to live. Good luck!

132
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:54,532
Good luck... Go on.

133
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,852
How many days will it take?

134
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:26,534
If you chew it well and close
your eyes, it tastes like bread.

135
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,136
Don't think about it, girl.
Shrug it off.

136
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,895
You forget everything here,
except cold and hunger.

137
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,295
The rest is a lot of rubbish.
Isn't that right?

138
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:43,213
No, I don't think so.

139
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,734
-How long have you been here?
-Over six months.

140
00:20:45,820 --> 00:20:49,699
Wait then. We'll see in a
year... if you're still alive.

141
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,295
You listen to me, girl. In here
the cleanest one stinks.

142
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:59,935
-What can you see, Isabella?
-Still nothing but woods.

143
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,171
-What kind of woods?
-I wouldn't know.

144
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:07,048
-Looks like oak.
-Still god-awful Germany then.

145
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:10,976
Right, who'll give me
some bread for a cigarette?

146
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,177
Where do you get
all that stuff?

147
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:17,213
It isn't like that, you know.

148
00:21:17,460 --> 00:21:20,611
There's one thing they can't
take from us against our wiII.

149
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:24,978
Our seIf-respect.
I'm positive of that.

150
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,772
What's wrong? Are you sick?

151
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:42,409
Go on, cry...

152
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:01,178
Stand up!

153
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:06,015
-Back!
-Get out of here!

154
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:09,811
Come on! Move!

155
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,051
Quick! Quick!

156
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:29,217
It's stopping again.
Take a look.

157
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:35,770
-What can you see?
-A station...

158
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:39,136
-but there's no name.
-Another train full of prisoners.

159
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:41,893
This damned war
will never end!

160
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,414
-They're not speaking German.
-You sure?

161
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,412
-Can't you hear them?
-What's next to Germany?

162
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,934
-France?
-You'd Iike that, wouldn't you?

163
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:56,777
Poland!

164
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:01,939
Open the wagons!

165
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:08,972
Come down!

166
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:12,575
Move!

167
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:22,251
Quickly!

168
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:35,133
Hurry up!

169
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:39,975
Come down!

170
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:47,018
Get off!

171
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:53,095
Line up!

172
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:56,411
Stay stiII!

173
00:23:57,940 --> 00:24:02,172
Now, move!

174
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:05,771
Come on, march!

175
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:11,617
One! Two! Three! Four!

176
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:16,252
Keep in step!

177
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:21,851
One! Two! Three! Four!

178
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:30,858
Any news from Warsaw?
How are they there?

179
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:34,012
Better than you, Iass...
Better than you.

180
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:37,297
Good luck.

181
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:22,690
Back!

182
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:26,898
Go back!

183
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:59,056
Go now! Go away!

184
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:05,617
Line up!

185
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:09,132
Come on!

186
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,009
Look what you've done!

187
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:43,979
Give me another ration!

188
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:07,289
Nicole...

189
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:11,409
I realized from the start
you were a nice girl

190
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,413
... in spite of
your black triangle.

191
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:17,651
Who sent you along with us?
The infirmary doctor, right?

192
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:22,410
He's a good man. He has
saved a lot of girls like you.

193
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,409
You're Jewish, aren't you?

194
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:29,414
No, I'm not Jewish.

195
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:32,657
Attention, please!
General roll call!

196
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:35,812
Line up!

197
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,570
Attention, please!
General roll call!

198
00:28:42,940 --> 00:28:45,738
Line up!

199
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,533
-How many are the politicals?
-About 50 percent, but you...

200
00:29:27,340 --> 00:29:31,572
... can't trust them. Most of them
have been here at least 2 years.

201
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:35,491
-They renegade?
-They adapted.

202
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:39,569
One's even been made a Kapo.
The woman on block 10.

203
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:44,419
She was a good partisan
once, then bit by bit...

204
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:48,896
I speak fluent German.

205
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:52,768
-Could that do me any good?
-Probably.

206
00:29:53,820 --> 00:29:57,893
If they make you an interpreter,
you couId be useful

207
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,894
... on a lot of occasion.

208
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,857
All in all, this is
far better than Auschwitz.

209
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:10,529
Yes. We sleep better, we
eat better. You've seen that.

210
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:13,734
They want to get
the most out of us.

211
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:17,418
It's obviously in their interests.

212
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:20,208
But there's still
the screenings nightmare.

213
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,939
-Here too?
-Yes.

214
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,978
The SS doctor examines us
every four months.

215
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,413
The oldest and thinnest
are sent away.

216
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:35,574
A sore's enough, the slightest
wound, and you're replaced.

217
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:40,696
You came to replace
100 other women.

218
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:45,890
-Where did they take them?
-Nobody knows.

219
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,054
But you can be sure...

220
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:53,293
there's a gas chamber there.

221
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:03,012
What's wrong, silly?
Go to sleep!

222
00:31:03,980 --> 00:31:07,131
I don't want to die!

223
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:20,053
Come on! Work!

224
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:27,052
Quicker!

225
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:31,331
Move!

226
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:45,289
No mill, no meal!

227
00:32:57,740 --> 00:33:00,174
Idiot! Can't you look
where you're going?

228
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:03,536
Damn you! I'll teach you
to leave your work!

229
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,938
I'll warm you up!
1 5 days in solitary!

230
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:45,018
-Hi, Carole.
-Hello.

231
00:33:46,060 --> 00:33:49,211
-What on earth did you say?
-I don't understand.

232
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,420
-What are you, anyway?
-Russian.

233
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,458
She hasn't been here long.
She's a bit...

234
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,975
Anna, the Red Army's
coming, right?

235
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,418
Yes, yes, it's coming.

236
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,170
Interpreter!

237
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:21,735
Well done, they let you go.
I didn't think you'd make it.

238
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:27,215
Did they bit you up again?

239
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:41,292
Have you understood?
Now go and tell them!

240
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:45,850
Attention, please!
The Kapo said...

241
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:49,897
Who took my potato?

242
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,295
Give it back, Nicole.
It's mine.

243
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:01,850
-Nicole...!
-I gave it to her.

244
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,855
-I traded my undershirt for it.
-Who cares!

245
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,411
It's mine! I put it on the
stove a few minutes ago!

246
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:14,060
You must have eaten it
without reaIizing.

247
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:22,413
If it really was stolen,
get it back.

248
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,248
I'm suprised at you.
You're a political!

249
00:35:26,340 --> 00:35:29,935
You mean the politicals
are better than us?

250
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,931
You heard her ladyship?
She's scared though.

251
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:37,292
Yet she was in the Resistence.

252
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:40,816
I wonder how her ladyship
resisted back home?

253
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,698
Hey, Georgette,
stop that, will you!

254
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:47,292
I wouldn't brag about
being here for stealing.

255
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:50,053
Come here and repeat that
if you dare!

256
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:53,291
-I'm coming.
-Attagirl, you show her!

257
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:00,852
-Come on, stop that, girls!
-Let me go!

258
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:12,169
Blocks number 1 and 2!
Wash yourseIf!

259
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:33,298
What a spring! The water
gets colder every day.

260
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:38,019
Her ladyship expects hot
water? It's melted snow.

261
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,289
Aren't you going
to wash, Nicole?

262
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,775
That's what they want.
That's just what they're after.

263
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:05,650
To cancel us...
turn us into animals.

264
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:08,416
We have to hold out.

265
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,695
-By washing?
-That too.

266
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,619
It's a way to make us feel
like human beings.

267
00:37:14,620 --> 00:37:17,214
To stop ourseIves
turning into brutes.

268
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:29,898
Come here! All of you!

269
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:44,576
1 1 321 ! 3826!

270
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:48,616
Out!

271
00:38:15,180 --> 00:38:18,252
1 21 30!

272
00:38:21,860 --> 00:38:24,738
669!

273
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:27,899
71 5!

274
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:32,174
231 !

275
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:34,410
I've got through three
screenings. Last time...

276
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,014
... I had a sore on my foot.
They didn't notice.

277
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,892
Luck, that's all. If they don't
like the look of your face...

278
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:42,891
... being healthy
won't heIp you.

279
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,810
-Does the grey still show?
-No, don't worry.

280
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:58,295
I have good hands, good feet.
Why worry about my teeth?

281
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:01,053
You'll see why, you'll see.

282
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:03,938
3006!

283
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:07,092
-You know you have to go.
-You're all right.

284
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,648
Shove her out,
or they'll take it out on us.

285
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:13,409
Good luck... be brave.

286
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:18,573
Attention, please!
All the Kapos...

287
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:23,570
... of the blocks number
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 appear...

288
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:27,935
... before the Commander
for general roll call!

289
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:31,849
-Do I look less pale, now?
-Yes, that's a lot better.

290
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,491
You think I shouId
take the bandage off?

291
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:41,014
Sure, they'll see that
first thing.

292
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:44,420
921 5!

293
00:39:44,980 --> 00:39:48,814
Stand up straight and smile.
And stick your chest out.

294
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,815
If it shows a bit, all the better.

295
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,498
-Hide your hands.
-They're not that stupid!

296
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:01,970
-What hope have you got like that?
-10099!

297
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,936
That's you. Smile... smile.

298
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:21,732
Attention, please!
All the Kapos...

299
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:32,095
... appear
before the Commander!

300
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,528
Get dressed.

301
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:40,418
-Left!
-Come!

302
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:42,775
Interpreter! Come here!

303
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:05,575
Feet... Your feet!

304
00:41:07,740 --> 00:41:09,696
The other one.

305
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,534
Good... your hands... Hands!

306
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,169
Turn them over!

307
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,890
-Left!
-Go!

308
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,175
Next one!

309
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,410
Come!

310
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,650
Attention, please!
All the Kapos...

311
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:44,415
-Here she is!
-Which is the good side?

312
00:41:44,500 --> 00:41:48,937
-Left or right? Tell me!
-I couldn't find out.

313
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:51,454
Left or right?

314
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:54,771
-I tell you, I don't know.
-It's easy to find out.

315
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:00,818
We'll just ask where they
sent the oldest women.

316
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,898
Well, Ninette?
Left or right?

317
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:15,097
Why are you asking me?
Maybe I made it.

318
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:19,616
Sure, maybe you did.
But was it left or right?

319
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,737
Right.

320
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:28,410
Hell!

321
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,931
Don't cry.
They won't send you away.

322
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:47,496
You'll see,
Red Army come in time.

323
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,699
Right?

324
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:02,459
I fooled them!
Look at my hands!

325
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:06,135
I made it!

326
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:10,099
Look!

327
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:18,573
I showed you!

328
00:43:21,700 --> 00:43:24,931
One! Two! Three! Four!

329
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,890
Stay back!

330
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:45,218
Hey, you! Line up!

331
00:43:46,780 --> 00:43:50,216
Drop dead!

332
00:44:01,660 --> 00:44:04,493
Well, aren't you going
to say goodbye?

333
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:08,971
Now you're scared of saying
goodbye to me, you bitches!

334
00:44:09,740 --> 00:44:14,416
Cowards! They've turned
you into a bunch of sheep!

335
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:20,411
Cowards!

336
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,220
You too! Cowards!

337
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:27,419
Damn murderer! Scumbag!

338
00:44:29,060 --> 00:44:32,018
Scumbag! Scumbag!

339
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,410
You don't scare me any more!
I know where you're taking us!

340
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:38,458
Vultures! Brutes! You'll die too!

341
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,213
They'll kill your kids!
Your damn mothers!

342
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,814
Damn your mothers!

343
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:50,612
You, you and you!
Come with me!

344
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,894
In step!

345
00:44:59,460 --> 00:45:02,497
Hitch her up!

346
00:45:12,460 --> 00:45:17,170
One! Two! Three! Four!

347
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:58,694
Take the lime!

348
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,571
What are you doing?

349
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,412
Her socks...

350
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,411
Good.

351
00:46:10,300 --> 00:46:12,450
Hey, you!

352
00:46:14,860 --> 00:46:17,738
I have to send
another girl to the SS.

353
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:21,017
I'll take her after roll call.

354
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:24,729
Tell number 10099. It's
worth her while, tell her.

355
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,574
-But she's a child!
-Exactly.

356
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,770
Nicole!

357
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:37,489
Alice wants to make you
a ridiculous proposal.

358
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:40,048
She'd Iike you to go...

359
00:46:40,140 --> 00:46:43,689
... to the SS tonight. You
don't want to, of course.

360
00:46:44,860 --> 00:46:47,897
-You don't, do you?
-Why not?

361
00:46:48,340 --> 00:46:51,013
-What has she said?
-Nothing.

362
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:54,490
But you have no experience.
Have you ever been with a man?

363
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,529
-No.
-No?

364
00:46:58,220 --> 00:47:01,018
But if I go, will they give me
something to eat?

365
00:47:02,260 --> 00:47:05,013
-Nicole!
-Ask her that.

366
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:10,099
Ask her!

367
00:47:12,860 --> 00:47:15,090
Anyone play cards with me?

368
00:47:15,180 --> 00:47:18,138
-No.
-Play on your own.

369
00:47:18,220 --> 00:47:22,691
... and good night...

370
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:26,410
Look what I brought you!
Like her?

371
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:30,732
What can you do with that?

372
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:37,458
Are we supposed to adopt her?

373
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:41,616
She's pretty, isn't she?
I had her cleaned up.

374
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:44,976
-But she weighs 60 pounds!
-I like them like that.

375
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:49,053
Right, baby? Come on...

376
00:47:49,340 --> 00:47:53,094
Have fun then!

377
00:48:58,820 --> 00:49:01,095
-Did it come out?
-The hell it did!

378
00:49:02,820 --> 00:49:05,618
-How did it go?
-Just great.

379
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:09,412
I was right. She's a virgin.

380
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:14,453
She was a virgin!

381
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:20,056
Hey you... Why are you
still here? Scram!

382
00:49:20,860 --> 00:49:24,216
Excuse me, you said you'd
give me something to eat.

383
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,293
-What did she said?
-She wants to eat.

384
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:29,735
Tomorrow!

385
00:49:30,260 --> 00:49:32,410
Tomorrow...

386
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:52,852
Attention!
The Camp Commander...

387
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,691
... wishes you all
a Merry Christmas.

388
00:49:57,220 --> 00:50:00,417
Now sing!

389
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:15,059
How is it you've come
today too?

390
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:17,895
Your mates sent for me.

391
00:50:17,980 --> 00:50:21,734
Guess they changed their minds.
They're in town getting drunk.

392
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:25,696
-Why didn't you go with them?
-I don't like drinking.

393
00:50:26,460 --> 00:50:29,418
What do you like, Karl?
Just the war?

394
00:50:34,060 --> 00:50:37,655
Where were you
last Christmas?

395
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,415
In Cracow. And you?

396
00:50:40,660 --> 00:50:43,732
Here. And before that?

397
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:48,416
-In Paris.
-Do you like Paris?

398
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:53,099
It's just another city...
only a bit noisier.

399
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:56,732
It was good the first day,
when we entered.

400
00:50:57,340 --> 00:51:00,298
And the Champs Elysées,
the day of our parade.

401
00:51:00,860 --> 00:51:03,249
Out.

402
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,778
Do you mind...
not being at home?

403
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:15,698
Because it's Christmas?
Nonsense!

404
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:19,218
What things are
important for you?

405
00:51:21,260 --> 00:51:25,412
My country, I think. Only
my country is important.

406
00:51:33,340 --> 00:51:35,808
What if you lose the war?

407
00:51:36,060 --> 00:51:38,210
Impossible.

408
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:42,769
But if you do lose?

409
00:51:47,220 --> 00:51:49,415
Your turn, Karl.

410
00:52:17,180 --> 00:52:20,092
We can't get news
from the front any more.

411
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:24,249
Morale is pretty low,
even among the politicals.

412
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:28,532
I told the women in my hut
to sabotage the work.

413
00:52:28,620 --> 00:52:31,692
-They just laughed.
-It's the same in the factory.

414
00:52:31,780 --> 00:52:34,010
We need the right arguments.

415
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,410
-They'll listen to talk of escape.
-Let's talk of escape then.

416
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:40,652
That's useless,
since escape is impossible.

417
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:44,176
It's not useless. Look...

418
00:52:44,860 --> 00:52:47,294
They're as thick
as thieves now.

419
00:52:48,460 --> 00:52:51,054
Are you nuts?
That was a wollen shirt.

420
00:52:51,140 --> 00:52:53,415
At least two more packs,
or I'll have it back.

421
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:57,288
-Okay, I'll try tomorrow.
-How about some more jam?

422
00:52:57,620 --> 00:53:01,169
-Civilians go for that.
-Karl says nothing must be...

423
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:04,297
wasted because his mates
at the front are starving.

424
00:53:04,380 --> 00:53:07,929
Rubbish! What does he care
about his mates at the front!

425
00:53:09,100 --> 00:53:11,295
He'll have forgotten
by tomorrow.

426
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:13,496
-All right, I'll try again.
-Nicole!

427
00:53:13,580 --> 00:53:15,536
Hurry up! Go inside!

428
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:19,499
The block leader's leaving.
I might get picked to replace her.

429
00:53:19,860 --> 00:53:22,420
If so, they'll need
a new Kapo for this hut.

430
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,412
I could put your name
forward. Tell your friends...

431
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:27,934
... about all I do for you.
And get busy!

432
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:31,137
If one of them steps in,
it's your lucky day.

433
00:53:40,100 --> 00:53:45,094
Good evening, Miss! How are
they at the command post?

434
00:53:47,500 --> 00:53:51,618
-What do you mean?
-Just asking how they were.

435
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:57,693
Mind you own business
in future!

436
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:29,492
Line up!

437
00:55:19,220 --> 00:55:23,418
Prisoners, attention!

438
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,412
You are prisoners
of the German Reich.

439
00:55:34,860 --> 00:55:37,818
You work
for the German Reich

440
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:41,213
... and in return
the Reich feeds you.

441
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:45,737
It's a cIear-cut relationship.

442
00:55:50,260 --> 00:55:53,889
Whoever betrays this
relationship is punished.

443
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:04,695
The prisoner 871 1
sabotaged the factory work,

444
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:08,409
by attempting
to damage the machines.

445
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:14,018
The prisoner 871 1
was caught in the act.

446
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:20,897
Sabotage is punished
with death.

447
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:28,293
Translate.

448
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:39,096
Translate! Translate!

449
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:44,855
It is right...

450
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:53,053
It is right that such criminaIs
should hang. Is that clear?

451
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:55,974
Yes, Sir!

452
00:56:56,340 --> 00:56:59,173
Now proceed!

453
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:07,613
Hey, you! Look up!

454
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:32,490
1 5 days in solitary and
3 months on half rations.

455
00:58:00,260 --> 00:58:02,649
-Is it time?
-Five minutes.

456
00:58:03,340 --> 00:58:05,854
Good.

457
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:14,650
I've applied for the front again.

458
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:17,652
Even one-hand men should
be needed now. I hope so!

459
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:21,210
-Don't you like it here?
-No, I'm bored.

460
00:58:21,780 --> 00:58:24,738
-Why, do you like it?
-I do now.

461
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:27,937
I eat well, I sleep weII.
No work, no screenings.

462
00:58:28,620 --> 00:58:32,169
-Is that all you care about?
-What else is there?

463
00:58:45,060 --> 00:58:47,255
When are you going
to eat that?

464
00:58:47,340 --> 00:58:49,900
At night,
or else I can't sleep.

465
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:53,092
You know it's less nourishing
when it's stale?

466
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:56,892
And the effort not to touch it,
that's bad for you.

467
00:58:57,220 --> 00:58:59,609
It weakens you, you know that?

468
00:59:00,540 --> 00:59:03,134
You're still on half ration, huh?

469
00:59:50,740 --> 00:59:53,573
The Russians sing now.
One of your songs.

470
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:56,049
We don't know what
we're allowed to sing.

471
00:59:56,140 --> 00:59:58,415
Whatever you know,
just sing it well.

472
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,810
-''Holy War''
-Don't be funny.

473
01:00:01,900 --> 01:00:05,415
-You want to get us killed?
-We don't know anything else.

474
01:00:06,140 --> 01:00:09,291
''Holy War''. Let's sing!

475
01:00:49,180 --> 01:00:54,129
The Russians!

476
01:00:56,660 --> 01:01:01,097
You were right...
The Red Army's come.

477
01:01:32,660 --> 01:01:38,417
One moment... Show them
the empty bunks! Go on in.

478
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:44,258
Come on... Come on...

479
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:09,017
My boys...

480
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:14,414
My boys!

481
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:36,692
Well? Aren't the rest
of you going to hug us?

482
01:02:39,180 --> 01:02:42,729
Where have you come from?
Say something to us.

483
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:48,419
Pilot.

484
01:02:58,540 --> 01:03:02,010
-Quiet... quiet!
-She's right, they'll hear us.

485
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:05,217
Hold on.

486
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:08,133
Show us the bunks
that need dismantling.

487
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:11,098
We'll answer your questions
while we work, okay?

488
01:03:35,180 --> 01:03:37,648
It won't be long. The Allies
have landed in Normandy.

489
01:03:37,740 --> 01:03:40,413
The Germans lost Stalingrad,

490
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,537
the Red Army's at the Dnieper.

491
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:47,454
-Couldn't they counter-attack?
-No, not any more.

492
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:52,931
The whole front's on the move.
You'll see.

493
01:03:55,220 --> 01:03:58,769
-And the Red Army will get here.
-What?...

494
01:03:58,860 --> 01:04:02,569
-The Red Army will get here.
-Yes...

495
01:04:02,660 --> 01:04:06,209
They'll get here and free us all.

496
01:04:06,620 --> 01:04:10,295
-Is that really true?
-Sure!

497
01:04:11,260 --> 01:04:13,933
They brought us here to build
fortifications, because they're...

498
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:18,298
... retreating and we'll see them
all run away from here.

499
01:04:19,460 --> 01:04:24,409
We'll skin him alive
and dunk him in vinegar.

500
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:26,456
-Who?
-Faust!

501
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,460
You'll do what?

502
01:04:36,060 --> 01:04:40,292
-Nothing. I was joking.
-Watch it!

503
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:43,935
And you men, get on with it!

504
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:48,811
-Who's that?
-Our Kapo.

505
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:51,289
Don't you have them?

506
01:04:51,380 --> 01:04:54,417
No, we just have
a hut representative.

507
01:04:55,060 --> 01:04:57,858
You're not scared
of a kid like that?

508
01:04:57,940 --> 01:05:01,819
You'll see, son... You'll
find out what a Kapo is.

509
01:05:19,540 --> 01:05:22,737
-Is he Faust?
-Yes.

510
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:26,971
-What does it says?
-''Touch Faust and you die''.

511
01:05:28,540 --> 01:05:31,293
-The SS wrote that?
-Yes.

512
01:05:31,820 --> 01:05:35,495
-They're nice to cats.
-Are you nice to everyone?

513
01:05:35,660 --> 01:05:38,618
No... not everyone.

514
01:05:39,820 --> 01:05:42,573
Come on, get your mates.
It's roll call soon.

515
01:05:42,660 --> 01:05:45,413
-They haven't called us yet.
-I'll take you.

516
01:05:46,460 --> 01:05:50,738
-Attention, please!

517
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:55,739
-Roll call! Roll call!
-All the Kapos must...

518
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:58,778
... count the prisoners
and wait for new orders!

519
01:06:04,580 --> 01:06:07,458
Come on, you, get moving.

520
01:06:14,060 --> 01:06:18,690
You ate the lot!
Give it back, you bitch!

521
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:22,250
-Give it back!
-What's going on?

522
01:06:22,340 --> 01:06:25,935
She stole my bread!
Nearly half a loaf I'd put by!

523
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:29,057
She scoffed the lot!
Bitch! Scumbag!

524
01:06:29,140 --> 01:06:31,734
Tough luck!
Now go to roll call.

525
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:36,974
-What am I going to do?
-Go!

526
01:06:37,860 --> 01:06:39,896
Is it true?

527
01:06:42,580 --> 01:06:46,289
-I couldn't stand it any longer.
-Let's go, it's roll call.

528
01:06:46,380 --> 01:06:49,531
-Let me be, NicoIe.
-Let's go.

529
01:06:51,260 --> 01:06:53,933
See? Washing every morning
didn't do you any good.

530
01:06:54,020 --> 01:06:56,011
Leave me here, please.

531
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,739
-You preached so well.
-Leave me here.

532
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:03,133
Remember? You kept
repeating it to me.

533
01:07:03,220 --> 01:07:06,656
''We mustn't let ourselves
go, we must react''.

534
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:10,054
And look at you now!

535
01:07:10,980 --> 01:07:15,770
-Exactly like all the rest.
-One! Two! Three! Four!...

536
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:21,737
But it's natural. You
preached a load of rubbish.

537
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:27,410
Now what's got into you?
Where are you going, silly?

538
01:08:11,380 --> 01:08:16,056
Kapo, come here and
bring three prisoners!

539
01:08:39,260 --> 01:08:42,093
Come on, Boris!

540
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:45,653
Get moving, Boris!

541
01:08:47,860 --> 01:08:51,739
-Come on, try!
-I can't do it.

542
01:08:54,100 --> 01:08:58,173
On your feet! At once!
Get to work!

543
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,533
What are you doing?

544
01:09:02,860 --> 01:09:05,977
Come here,
you filthy prisoner!

545
01:09:14,220 --> 01:09:17,417
Come on! Go on working!

546
01:09:19,500 --> 01:09:24,016
Come nearer!

547
01:09:26,300 --> 01:09:28,655
See that?

548
01:09:29,940 --> 01:09:32,773
Stay here and rest.

549
01:09:32,860 --> 01:09:35,658
-They won't notice if I go.
-Thank you.

550
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:45,175
They say our advance stopped
and they are counter-attacking.

551
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:49,009
-They'll be in Moscow by June.
-That's what they say.

552
01:09:49,780 --> 01:09:54,058
Meanwhile they just shot another
man and we've waited 3 months!

553
01:09:54,940 --> 01:09:58,774
-What do you want to do?
-Anything, whiIe there's time.

554
01:09:59,220 --> 01:10:02,849
-Before we get to be like them.
-Hey! Wait!

555
01:10:02,940 --> 01:10:05,932
Could you take this to...

556
01:10:06,020 --> 01:10:09,899
What are you doing there?
Damn you!

557
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:14,970
-Read it! It's for my mother!
-It's forbidden!

558
01:10:15,060 --> 01:10:18,689
-Give me the address.
-Alma Rudnicka, Hoza 1 2...

559
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:22,216
-Bitch! You're like an animal!
-Hands off, you idiot!

560
01:10:23,300 --> 01:10:25,450
Letters are forbidden,

561
01:10:25,540 --> 01:10:28,213
-and speaking to civilians!
-Who are you? One of them?

562
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:30,416
Why do you do it?

563
01:10:30,500 --> 01:10:34,129
-Just because.
-What happened, Nicole?

564
01:10:34,220 --> 01:10:36,734
-If they saw you, you're dead.
-What did he do?

565
01:10:36,820 --> 01:10:39,414
He wanted to send
a letter home. I tore it up.

566
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:09,896
Stand here and don't move.

567
01:11:10,460 --> 01:11:13,418
All night. Stand to attention.

568
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:17,457
If you lean forward,
there's the high voItage.

569
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:20,652
If you step back,
the sentry will get you.

570
01:11:21,460 --> 01:11:24,611
If he moves, shoot!

571
01:11:25,180 --> 01:11:28,138
Good night... comrade!

572
01:11:59,060 --> 01:12:02,689
This is how they should dress
us Kapos. Nice, isn't it?

573
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:06,738
-Look!
-They're going steady!

574
01:12:17,260 --> 01:12:20,411
In other lagers Kapos can wear
civilian clothes, did you know?

575
01:12:20,500 --> 01:12:22,889
We should ask to do that too.

576
01:12:31,620 --> 01:12:34,293
Nice! What did you
give for them!

577
01:12:34,740 --> 01:12:37,174
Not much, three packs
of cigarettes.

578
01:13:15,987 --> 01:13:18,865
What are you waiting for?

579
01:13:19,347 --> 01:13:22,498
Want a cigarette? Catch!

580
01:13:24,547 --> 01:13:27,186
Go on, have a smoke!

581
01:13:28,747 --> 01:13:31,500
Pick it up, I won't shoot you.

582
01:13:32,187 --> 01:13:36,226
I won't shoot! Go on!

583
01:13:37,547 --> 01:13:40,266
Don't you like smoking?

584
01:13:42,707 --> 01:13:45,699
You need it to move a bit,
to rest your muscles,

585
01:13:45,787 --> 01:13:48,620
or else you'll never make it.
You can't make it.

586
01:13:50,907 --> 01:13:54,058
Come on!
Don't you trust me?

587
01:13:57,347 --> 01:14:01,499
You won't make it.

588
01:14:02,627 --> 01:14:06,097
You'll never make it.
You'll croak anyway!

589
01:15:05,347 --> 01:15:08,623
Sentry post number 7.
Changing of the guard.

590
01:15:17,947 --> 01:15:21,383
-Is he still alive?
-That one's a stayer.

591
01:15:25,187 --> 01:15:27,542
Want to bet?

592
01:15:30,747 --> 01:15:33,784
No, not like that. Let's wait
and see what happens.

593
01:15:38,227 --> 01:15:40,695
Okay. Come!

594
01:16:05,947 --> 01:16:09,098
Attention, please!

595
01:16:09,187 --> 01:16:12,224
All the prisoners...

596
01:16:12,307 --> 01:16:16,380
... in the main square!

597
01:16:16,467 --> 01:16:20,301
All the prisoners...

598
01:16:20,387 --> 01:16:22,503
... in the main square!

599
01:16:32,307 --> 01:16:35,265
Attention, please!

600
01:16:35,347 --> 01:16:38,498
All the prisoners...

601
01:16:38,587 --> 01:16:42,500
... in the main square!

602
01:16:43,147 --> 01:16:46,742
All the prisoners...

603
01:16:46,827 --> 01:16:48,783
... in the main square!

604
01:16:52,147 --> 01:16:54,980
Come... come!

605
01:17:16,147 --> 01:17:20,026
One! Two! Three! Four!

606
01:17:21,747 --> 01:17:25,979
Join the others!
You must work!

607
01:17:37,627 --> 01:17:40,061
In step!

608
01:17:46,547 --> 01:17:49,903
Come on, quickly!
Join the others!

609
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:34,696
Here, bread and margarine.

610
01:18:39,427 --> 01:18:42,100
Go on, blow your whistle!
Call your pals!

611
01:18:44,427 --> 01:18:47,783
You think a bit of bread is
enough to put everything right?

612
01:19:15,587 --> 01:19:16,691
Hey, that's artillery!

613
01:19:19,121 --> 01:19:20,558
That's our men!

614
01:19:22,500 --> 01:19:23,800
Hear them? 100 kilometers.

615
01:19:25,201 --> 01:19:28,618
Less than 50!
It's a matter of days now.

616
01:19:29,201 --> 01:19:31,840
The war's over, Nicole.

617
01:19:32,881 --> 01:19:37,875
We'll go home, we'll go back
to our old lives, we'll forget.

618
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:42,629
Come on! Get on with it!

619
01:19:46,441 --> 01:19:49,478
Wonder how it will feel
to be free again?

620
01:19:49,921 --> 01:19:52,879
To do whatever we like...
anything at all.

621
01:19:53,041 --> 01:19:56,556
They celebrate in my town
when any of us go home.

622
01:19:58,361 --> 01:20:01,319
They welcome us
with music and flowers.

623
01:20:01,521 --> 01:20:04,718
And we dance all night...
we sing... we shout...

624
01:20:04,801 --> 01:20:07,440
Nobody sleeps that night.

625
01:20:10,601 --> 01:20:12,956
Do you like dancing, Nicole?

626
01:20:13,201 --> 01:20:15,556
Yes, I used to love it.

627
01:20:20,721 --> 01:20:25,158
Run for it, Sasha! There's
only one German on the bank.

628
01:20:25,241 --> 01:20:28,756
I'll distract him, so you can run
to the river and get away.

629
01:20:28,841 --> 01:20:32,595
But why? It's only
a matter of days now.

630
01:20:33,321 --> 01:20:35,915
They'll have to let us all go.

631
01:20:36,001 --> 01:20:38,561
No... who knows
what they'll do.

632
01:20:38,641 --> 01:20:42,919
There won't be another
chance. Today's the last day...

633
01:20:43,001 --> 01:20:46,835
-they'll bring you out to work.
-Get moving!

634
01:20:48,001 --> 01:20:51,277
With two hands! Hurry up!

635
01:20:55,081 --> 01:20:57,914
What about my mates?
There'll be a reprisal.

636
01:20:58,001 --> 01:21:01,152
Why worry about them?
Come with me, but be carefuI.

637
01:21:10,921 --> 01:21:13,276
I don't know the area.
They'll catch me.

638
01:21:13,361 --> 01:21:16,512
The partisans are over there.
We hear shots now and then.

639
01:21:26,401 --> 01:21:28,790
Let's wait for him to move away.

640
01:21:30,521 --> 01:21:33,877
What will you do?

641
01:21:34,401 --> 01:21:37,199
Me? What can I do?
I'll stay with them.

642
01:21:37,641 --> 01:21:40,792
-Don't you want to get away?
-And go where?

643
01:21:41,761 --> 01:21:44,036
But where will you go
when the war's over?

644
01:21:44,121 --> 01:21:47,158
I don't know,
I haven't thought.

645
01:21:47,761 --> 01:21:50,434
Where do your parents live?

646
01:21:51,721 --> 01:21:54,838
Dead... they're dead.

647
01:21:59,361 --> 01:22:01,955
-Go now, Sasha!
-No!

648
01:22:03,801 --> 01:22:06,315
I can't do it.

649
01:22:13,721 --> 01:22:16,519
Attention, please!

650
01:22:16,601 --> 01:22:20,992
The Blocks number
18A, 24B and 1 3C...

651
01:22:21,601 --> 01:22:24,991
... go immediately...

652
01:22:25,081 --> 01:22:28,790
... to the Commander!

653
01:22:30,041 --> 01:22:32,680
Attention, please!

654
01:22:40,321 --> 01:22:43,757
... 18A and 1 3C...

655
01:22:44,321 --> 01:22:49,441
... go immediately
to the Commander!

656
01:22:51,761 --> 01:22:56,039
Look! They're pulling out!

657
01:22:56,201 --> 01:22:59,955
Get off! Get off!

658
01:23:00,281 --> 01:23:03,876
Stay back!

659
01:23:05,601 --> 01:23:08,957
Go away!

660
01:23:09,201 --> 01:23:12,238
Come on! Quickly!

661
01:23:14,561 --> 01:23:18,315
Stay back! Back!

662
01:23:33,561 --> 01:23:36,553
Look at them! They're
worse than animals!

663
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:39,474
Animal sense when
they're about to die,

664
01:23:39,561 --> 01:23:41,916
-but this lot...
-Die?

665
01:23:42,001 --> 01:23:44,561
-Yes.
-Who told you that?

666
01:23:44,641 --> 01:23:48,998
They transfer us to Germany
to a suitably equipped camp.

667
01:23:49,801 --> 01:23:53,430
Seems they can do away
with over 5000 a day.

668
01:23:54,881 --> 01:23:59,033
Not you, silly! They'll make us
auxiliaries in the Wehrmacht,

669
01:23:59,201 --> 01:24:02,955
with a uniform, pay,
and a clean police record.

670
01:24:03,401 --> 01:24:06,598
Good. You had me scared
for a minute.

671
01:24:07,201 --> 01:24:10,318
-Coming with me?
-No, I'm busy.

672
01:24:13,281 --> 01:24:15,954
Georgette! Here she comes!

673
01:24:19,441 --> 01:24:22,558
Excuse me, Kapo,

674
01:24:22,881 --> 01:24:26,351
I was on cleaning duty
today and I found this.

675
01:24:31,201 --> 01:24:34,557
This is how I found him.
Poor Faust!

676
01:24:35,081 --> 01:24:39,632
He was so sweet.

677
01:24:50,201 --> 01:24:53,876
You know they're going
to kill you too? All of you!

678
01:25:05,921 --> 01:25:08,435
Sasha! Come here.

679
01:25:14,521 --> 01:25:17,160
-What's up?
-Sasha...

680
01:25:30,961 --> 01:25:33,429
-Tuesday?
-Yes, the day after tomorrow.

681
01:25:33,601 --> 01:25:36,354
-We've got to try.
-You know it's sheer suicide!

682
01:25:36,441 --> 01:25:39,160
We can't escape
from this camp!

683
01:25:39,241 --> 01:25:41,960
We can't escape
from the gas chamber either.

684
01:25:42,041 --> 01:25:45,397
We've got to find a way
to cut the high-voltage Iine.

685
01:25:46,201 --> 01:25:49,273
We must prepare some tools
to cut the fence.

686
01:25:49,361 --> 01:25:51,875
I'll sharpen some stakes,
but it'll take 3 days.

687
01:25:51,961 --> 01:25:54,316
-Too long.
-But they watch us!

688
01:25:54,401 --> 01:25:57,837
What do we do
about the high voltage?

689
01:25:58,641 --> 01:26:01,235
The powerhouse
is near the camp gate.

690
01:26:01,321 --> 01:26:04,313
A Brit worked in there after
that woman killed herseIf.

691
01:26:04,401 --> 01:26:08,155
-We've got to talk to him.
-I did. He's willing to help.

692
01:26:08,241 --> 01:26:11,199
But he said we can't
get near the powerhouse

693
01:26:11,281 --> 01:26:13,795
and the high voltage
is never off.

694
01:26:13,881 --> 01:26:15,997
-The powerhouse is locked?
-Sure.

695
01:26:16,081 --> 01:26:18,390
We need
an imprint of the lock.

696
01:26:18,481 --> 01:26:21,234
-You go and get it, cIever!
-Hush!

697
01:26:43,681 --> 01:26:45,956
Maybe they're moving out.

698
01:26:46,041 --> 01:26:48,601
Are they really going?

699
01:26:48,801 --> 01:26:52,874
-Yes, yes, they are.
-Quiet, I can't hear a thing!

700
01:26:55,361 --> 01:26:57,955
Maybe they're leaving
and they'll let us go.

701
01:27:01,201 --> 01:27:04,159
You, you, you... and you.

702
01:27:04,401 --> 01:27:07,757
Get to work!
Come on, idiots, move!

703
01:27:34,001 --> 01:27:36,561
The imprint of the lock.

704
01:27:37,601 --> 01:27:41,435
-Thanks, Nicole.
-How come you all trusted me?

705
01:27:42,481 --> 01:27:45,951
-We weren't wrong, were you?
-Do the women know about me?

706
01:27:46,681 --> 01:27:50,276
-Not yet.
-Load the truck!

707
01:27:50,601 --> 01:27:53,877
Move! There's no time!

708
01:27:57,841 --> 01:27:59,991
Sasha...

709
01:28:04,201 --> 01:28:06,669
I want to tell you another thing.

710
01:28:06,761 --> 01:28:10,549
It isn't true I'm a thief.
And my name isn't Nicole.

711
01:28:10,921 --> 01:28:13,833
I... I'm a Jewish.

712
01:28:17,721 --> 01:28:21,157
-Nicole!
-See you later...

713
01:28:21,241 --> 01:28:24,199
... at the washhouse.
They'll be too busy to notice.

714
01:28:25,881 --> 01:28:30,238
Yes, Sir!

715
01:28:30,321 --> 01:28:32,915
Yes, Sir!

716
01:28:42,681 --> 01:28:46,435
-Will we make it, Sasha?
-Yes, you'll see.

717
01:28:46,961 --> 01:28:49,316
We'll make it, Nicole.

718
01:28:52,081 --> 01:28:54,231
Come.

719
01:29:08,281 --> 01:29:10,431
You'll really take me
home with you?

720
01:29:10,521 --> 01:29:12,876
Sure, you'll come with me.

721
01:29:12,961 --> 01:29:15,919
What will your family say?

722
01:29:17,481 --> 01:29:19,949
Let's see...

723
01:29:21,001 --> 01:29:23,720
My father will look at you
silently,

724
01:29:24,481 --> 01:29:28,474
then he'll say to me: ''Who
is this, Sasha? Your stuff?''

725
01:29:29,601 --> 01:29:32,479
He'll shake his head
and go, saying he's busy.

726
01:29:33,121 --> 01:29:36,431
-He won't like me then.
-Very much, but he won't say it.

727
01:29:36,521 --> 01:29:40,799
-Some old peopIe are like that.
-My father was the same.

728
01:29:41,321 --> 01:29:43,835
My mother, though,
she'll start crying.

729
01:29:43,921 --> 01:29:46,674
She'll ask if you're hungry,
if you're thirsty.

730
01:29:46,761 --> 01:29:49,150
If you're warm enough,
if you want a rest.

731
01:29:50,281 --> 01:29:53,159
And if you answer no
to all her questions,

732
01:29:54,201 --> 01:29:57,238
she'll smile
and she'll say to me...

733
01:30:03,241 --> 01:30:05,152
What?

734
01:30:05,241 --> 01:30:08,677
She'll say: ''She's a nice
girl, Sasha. Well done.''

735
01:30:16,401 --> 01:30:19,040
I'm not a nice girl,

736
01:30:19,201 --> 01:30:22,352
and your mother won't
like me. I'm different.

737
01:30:22,441 --> 01:30:24,796
-I...
-Nicole.

738
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:29,640
You still haven't told me
what your real name is.

739
01:30:30,241 --> 01:30:33,233
-Edith.
-Edith, listen. That's what...

740
01:30:34,041 --> 01:30:38,239
... my mother will say and I'll
say: ''Sure, she's a nice girl.''

741
01:30:39,201 --> 01:30:42,955
And she'll leave it at that.
We'll be able to go out,

742
01:30:44,121 --> 01:30:47,511
and I'll show you my town.
You'll like it, you'll see.

743
01:30:49,401 --> 01:30:52,234
And in the evening
we'll dress up

744
01:30:52,761 --> 01:30:55,355
and go out again,
the two of us together.

745
01:30:56,081 --> 01:30:59,039
We'll go wherever you like.
All right, Edith?

746
01:31:03,201 --> 01:31:06,398
-We'll go dancing, Sasha.
-Yes...

747
01:31:58,441 --> 01:32:01,160
-What time is it?
-6:25.

748
01:32:05,841 --> 01:32:07,991
She'll be here any minute.

749
01:32:10,601 --> 01:32:13,035
-The stakes?
-Ready in the workshop.

750
01:32:13,121 --> 01:32:15,794
-Yanko's coming soon.
-I can go, Salomone.

751
01:32:15,881 --> 01:32:20,033
No, Igor Borovin and
Yanko Milovic will go.

752
01:32:20,121 --> 01:32:22,237
We have work to do here.

753
01:32:23,201 --> 01:32:26,750
So, by 10 at the latest, if all
goes well you and Yanko...

754
01:32:26,841 --> 01:32:29,833
... will bring the guns here.
Nicole goes to the powerhouse.

755
01:32:30,401 --> 01:32:33,359
By 10:1 5 he shorts the circuit.

756
01:32:33,441 --> 01:32:36,717
At 10:20 the Brit has
to check the power's off.

757
01:32:37,001 --> 01:32:40,437
There's no need to check,
we'll hear the siren.

758
01:32:40,681 --> 01:32:43,753
-What siren?
-When the high voltage...

759
01:32:43,841 --> 01:32:46,355
... is turned off,
the aIarm sounds.

760
01:32:49,081 --> 01:32:51,231
The powerhouse is next
to the sentry post.

761
01:32:55,201 --> 01:32:57,431
... in front of
the main watch-tower.

762
01:32:57,521 --> 01:33:00,991
The SS will run up, but she'll
have knocked out the system.

763
01:33:01,081 --> 01:33:03,549
-And then?
-Everyone can get away.

764
01:33:04,201 --> 01:33:07,716
But not Nicole.
They'll kill her.

765
01:33:08,681 --> 01:33:10,876
She doesn't stand a chance!

766
01:33:10,961 --> 01:33:14,556
What do you want to do then?
Get us all killed?

767
01:33:14,641 --> 01:33:17,633
-You like life, don't you?
-Like anyone who's alive.

768
01:33:17,921 --> 01:33:21,231
-Would you do it?
-That's a silly question.

769
01:33:21,321 --> 01:33:24,711
You know I'd never get near it.
They'd stop me midway.

770
01:33:24,801 --> 01:33:28,840
But if you were her, would you
do it, Salomone Reitman?

771
01:33:32,601 --> 01:33:35,161
-Maybe...
-Maybe!

772
01:33:35,961 --> 01:33:39,920
And you're a man.
You have an idea, you fought.

773
01:33:42,041 --> 01:33:44,316
But Nicole... she's only 1 6.

774
01:33:46,201 --> 01:33:50,592
She knows nothing about these
things. She's suffered so much.

775
01:33:52,721 --> 01:33:55,872
-It's not up to her to die.
-I'll go, Sasha.

776
01:33:56,121 --> 01:33:59,238
-Let me try.
-That's impossible.

777
01:34:02,201 --> 01:34:04,874
I've seen Anna. She says
the women are going berserk

778
01:34:04,961 --> 01:34:07,475
... praying, crying,
talking about rebelling.

779
01:34:07,801 --> 01:34:11,157
A few nearly lynched an SS
who walked in, but fortunately...

780
01:34:11,241 --> 01:34:13,311
-Where's Anna?
-She's waiting near the fence.

781
01:34:13,401 --> 01:34:15,915
Tell her to pass it on
about the escape.

782
01:34:16,001 --> 01:34:19,994
The orders stand except the
signal will be given by a siren.

783
01:34:20,201 --> 01:34:24,035
When they hear it,
they have to run to the fence.

784
01:34:25,481 --> 01:34:27,790
Come straight back,
it's nearly time.

785
01:34:33,201 --> 01:34:38,434
There are 2000 women
in the camp.

786
01:34:39,801 --> 01:34:42,679
They've all suffered and
they have a right to live.

787
01:34:43,961 --> 01:34:49,160
And us? You say we fought
and we have an idea.

788
01:34:51,561 --> 01:34:55,031
What do you mean
by an idea?

789
01:35:02,001 --> 01:35:04,310
It's 6:40.

790
01:35:06,201 --> 01:35:09,398
What are they doing, Sasha?
Are they standing for me?

791
01:35:10,081 --> 01:35:12,515
It's settled then. Let's go.

792
01:35:19,721 --> 01:35:24,636
Can I have a word with you?

793
01:35:37,881 --> 01:35:40,679
You mustn't tell her anything.
Swear you won't.

794
01:35:41,121 --> 01:35:44,238
She'd refuse.
Why should she agree to do it?

795
01:35:44,321 --> 01:35:48,030
-Swear, Sasha.
-Yeah. Why should she agree?

796
01:35:49,961 --> 01:35:52,634
Her life in exchange
for so many others.

797
01:35:53,081 --> 01:35:55,754
But it is right
to reckon like that?

798
01:35:56,081 --> 01:35:59,357
-No.
-Well then?

799
01:36:04,081 --> 01:36:07,312
Yes, it's monstrous,
forcing men...

800
01:36:08,081 --> 01:36:10,549
... to reckon like that.

801
01:36:11,481 --> 01:36:16,032
But in this case, it becomes
necessary and even right...

802
01:36:17,521 --> 01:36:21,400
... to kill someone
in order to save many others.

803
01:36:23,641 --> 01:36:26,599
We're killing her,
you know that?

804
01:36:29,001 --> 01:36:31,196
No, Sasha, it's not us.

805
01:36:32,361 --> 01:36:34,750
We're not the ones to blame.

806
01:36:36,281 --> 01:36:40,274
Come on... swear.

807
01:36:43,361 --> 01:36:45,477
Swear.

808
01:36:48,361 --> 01:36:50,272
I swear.

809
01:37:00,401 --> 01:37:02,790
Aren't you busy now?

810
01:37:03,561 --> 01:37:05,870
We have 5 minutes left.

811
01:37:05,961 --> 01:37:08,395
Come, there's still
so much to say.

812
01:37:08,601 --> 01:37:11,593
We must decide how
we'll find one another.

813
01:37:11,841 --> 01:37:14,275
I thought about it
all night, you know.

814
01:37:14,561 --> 01:37:17,314
As soon as I've cut the
power, I'll come here.

815
01:37:18,081 --> 01:37:21,198
-You'll wait for me, Sasha?
-Yes, sure.

816
01:37:21,441 --> 01:37:25,639
And we'll escape together.
But if we miss each other...

817
01:37:27,481 --> 01:37:30,837
There, see the tallest tree
down there? Can you see it?

818
01:37:31,281 --> 01:37:34,398
-The tallest one of all.
-Yes.

819
01:37:35,241 --> 01:37:37,436
We'll meet there.

820
01:37:39,201 --> 01:37:41,351
I want to tell you
something too.

821
01:37:43,201 --> 01:37:45,635
The first times we met...

822
01:37:47,001 --> 01:37:49,720
I wasn't thinking about
escaping, you know?

823
01:37:51,881 --> 01:37:55,157
I didn't say all those things
to persuade you to heIp us.

824
01:37:56,641 --> 01:37:59,633
It was only because I was
falling in love with you.

825
01:38:03,921 --> 01:38:07,311
I love you...
I love you so much!

826
01:38:09,681 --> 01:38:12,434
You can feeI it, can't you?

827
01:38:14,961 --> 01:38:17,350
Yes, Sasha.

828
01:38:18,721 --> 01:38:22,350
Thank you for everything.

829
01:38:22,441 --> 01:38:27,151
No... you mustn't thank me.

830
01:38:29,201 --> 01:38:33,831
You see, things happen that
we can't do anything about.

831
01:38:36,081 --> 01:38:38,834
There shouId be love and
happiness for everyone

832
01:38:39,881 --> 01:38:43,874
and instead, we're forced
to kill and hate.

833
01:38:51,641 --> 01:38:56,431
-Will you understand?
-What? I don't understand.

834
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:08,439
Sasha, it's time.

835
01:39:19,281 --> 01:39:21,556
Yes.

836
01:39:23,281 --> 01:39:26,591
What?!

837
01:39:28,041 --> 01:39:31,033
Yes... yes.

838
01:39:33,961 --> 01:39:36,839
Yes, Sir.

839
01:39:38,481 --> 01:39:43,680
They're not sending
the trucks.

840
01:39:44,001 --> 01:39:47,152
-We have to eliminate them.
-But it takes too long!

841
01:39:47,841 --> 01:39:51,151
Have them start
digging a pit at once.

842
01:39:57,201 --> 01:39:59,715
Hide these documents!

843
01:40:13,881 --> 01:40:16,156
Thank you.

844
01:40:22,321 --> 01:40:25,552
Good luck...
Good luck, Yanko.

845
01:41:14,281 --> 01:41:18,354
Attention! Attention!
GeneraI roll call!

846
01:41:23,761 --> 01:41:26,229
We'd better go back.

847
01:41:57,361 --> 01:42:01,036
Come on! Get on with it!

848
01:42:12,921 --> 01:42:15,515
-Just our luck!
-Why is that?

849
01:42:15,641 --> 01:42:18,155
HQ didn't send the trucks.

850
01:42:18,241 --> 01:42:20,675
We'll have to bury them too,
afterwards.

851
01:42:22,281 --> 01:42:25,398
-Nice, huh?
-Alice, come here!

852
01:43:12,001 --> 01:43:15,880
Get moving!
Are you sleeping?

853
01:43:24,601 --> 01:43:27,035
Hurry up!

854
01:43:29,881 --> 01:43:32,475
I'm off then, Sasha.

855
01:43:33,121 --> 01:43:35,874
And remember,
the tallest tree.

856
01:43:37,281 --> 01:43:39,431
-Edith?
-What is it, Sasha?

857
01:43:39,521 --> 01:43:42,957
Quiet!

858
01:43:46,801 --> 01:43:49,156
As soon as
you cut the power...

859
01:43:49,761 --> 01:43:52,150
the siren will go off.

860
01:43:53,601 --> 01:43:56,798
They'll come
and they'll kill you.

861
01:43:58,481 --> 01:44:02,997
That's how it is, but I have
to ask you to go anyway.

862
01:44:06,521 --> 01:44:10,434
None of it's true
any more then?

863
01:44:11,201 --> 01:44:13,317
You must go.

864
01:44:14,881 --> 01:44:18,430
What should I do now?
What should I do?

865
01:44:18,721 --> 01:44:20,757
You must go.

866
01:44:22,481 --> 01:44:25,279
You... you want
to get me killed?

867
01:44:25,561 --> 01:44:28,553
You must go. You must.

868
01:44:28,641 --> 01:44:31,633
The lives of everyone
depend on you alone.

869
01:44:32,361 --> 01:44:36,149
-Yours too, right? Yours too!
-What's going on, Nicole?

870
01:44:36,241 --> 01:44:39,517
Nothing. Absolutely nothing.

871
01:44:58,881 --> 01:45:01,679
-When do we go?
-When it's all over.

872
01:45:02,081 --> 01:45:04,436
-Where to?
-Germany.

873
01:45:05,201 --> 01:45:07,590
The war's over now.

874
01:45:07,761 --> 01:45:11,549
They conned you, Karl.
They conned you too.

875
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:14,876
What will you do now?

876
01:45:15,721 --> 01:45:18,155
I don't know. And you?

877
01:45:19,281 --> 01:45:21,351
I don't know.

878
01:45:23,201 --> 01:45:25,840
Living isn't
all that necessary.

879
01:45:26,641 --> 01:45:30,475
True... it isn't necessary.

880
01:45:39,681 --> 01:45:43,799
-Go on working!
-Traitor! Scumbag!

881
01:45:45,721 --> 01:45:48,679
She'll go.
I'm sure she'll go.

882
01:45:50,281 --> 01:45:52,875
You'll see, she'll go.

883
01:48:43,001 --> 01:48:45,151
Nicole!

884
01:49:52,561 --> 01:49:55,155
Nicole!

885
01:50:02,081 --> 01:50:05,039
They conned us, Karl.

886
01:50:06,321 --> 01:50:09,040
They conned us both.

887
01:50:17,081 --> 01:50:20,790
Take this off me.

888
01:50:30,081 --> 01:50:33,153
The land of Israel
is enlightened...

889
01:50:33,441 --> 01:50:36,353
God is Israel...

890
01:50:36,921 --> 01:50:39,515
God is the light.

891
01:50:40,561 --> 01:50:43,473
Lord, my Lord...

892
01:50:43,561 --> 01:50:47,440
... you who break
the chains of the slaves...
