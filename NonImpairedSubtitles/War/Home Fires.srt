00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,710
- Hey!
- All right, ease up!

00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,591
WOMAN: Easy, now. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,437
BOY: On your way. Come on!

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,471
- Come on, girls, come on. Come on.
- Come on.

7
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,476
DRIVER: Get a move on!

00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,756

DRIVER: Are you bloody deaf?

- (Horn blares)
BOY: On your way. Come on.

13
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,678
Keep the girls moving, Stan.
Slow as they want.

14
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:37,073
All right, Mum.

15
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,316
What's she playing at?

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,471
♪ I can see them talking
but I only hear the voices in my head

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:47,115
♪ Waiting for the moment
they'll be calling to me

18

00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:58,118

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,031
How do you do?

41
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,832
- Well, all I can advise is don't get complacent.
- I won't.

42
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:23,668
Asthma's a condition that
can lie low for years,

43
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:28,430
then out of the blue something triggers an
attack and then suddenly you're in trouble.

44
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,550
Thanks for the all clear, Doctor.

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:37,195
- Give my regards to your mother, David.
- Will do, Mrs Campbell.

46
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,391
Thank you.

47
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,355
Have you given any more thought
to what I've asked - about enlisting?

48
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,631
I just want to know whether or not
they'd take me. That's all.

49
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,399
But if they say "yes",
then that <i>won't</i> be all, will it?

50
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:08,513
Erica, I'm not going to do anything rash.
I just want to know my options.

51
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,077
I suppose I was hoping that the girls and me
wanting you to stay with us

52
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,509
would be the only option you'd need.

53
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,915
The appointment's at 3.30.

54
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,713
I'll be back in time for evening surgery.

55
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,031
(Chatter)

56
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,154
- David's turning into a fine young man.
- Mm. He is.

57
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,879
Best enjoy this while we can.

58
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,356
Hitler's got enough on his plate
without picking a fight with us.

59
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,678
His appetite for territory seems rather insatiable.
Will you be there this evening?

60
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,154
- If I can get away.
- Oh, do try and make it, Miriam.

61
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,589
Turning out in force
to oppose Joyce's proposition

62
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,631
is the only way to get it thrown out.

63
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,478
- Will you be there, Alison?
- Of course. Boxing gloves on.

64
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:10,876
- Granite chin at the ready.
- Excellent. You may well need it.

65
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,956
I suspect it could get rather bloody.

66
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,236
How was the check-up?

67
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,395
Fine.

68
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,158
Good.

69
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,556
- What can I get you, Alison?
- Some tongue would be lovely.

70
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:31,148
Oh, I was expecting you back
half an hour ago, Claire.

71
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:34,192
I'm sorry, Mrs Cameron.
Bit of a queue at Brindsley's.

72
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,552
And then, in the grocer's, a few of us
were talking about tonight's meeting.

73
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,556
As my employee,

74
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:45,037
you'll appreciate that I expect you to vote
in favour of my proposition tonight.

75
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:50,155
Staff loyalty is a quality
that I hold in very high regard.

76
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,839
It's essential for a harmonious household.

77
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,791
Yes, Mrs Cameron.

78
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,354
There's a list of chores
on the kitchen table.

79
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,119
I'd like them completed by the time I return.

80
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,235
I'll be out all afternoon.

81
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,271
Yes, Mrs Cameron.

82
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,311
(Telephone ringing)

83
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,316
(Typing in background)

84
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,351
MAN: Mr Taylor, please.

85
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,311
SECOND MAN: Dr Campbell?

86
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,551
This way, please.

87
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,313
(Clock ticking)

88
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,231
(Bird cawing)

89
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,995
Waiting for inspiration, Mr Simms?

90
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,508
(Laughs)
Well, it has to come from somewhere.

91
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,596
We all assumed Pat was your muse.

92
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,710
Doesn't quite work like that.

93
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,716
- See you at the meeting tonight?
- Yes.

94
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,318
Thought you might like a sandwich.

95
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:55,151
Another coffee would be more useful.

96
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,316
How did it go?

97
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:09,475
Will?

98
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,318
You'll be pleased to know
I didn't pass the medical.

99
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,272
What do you mean "didn't pass"?
You're the fittest man I know.

100
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,709
They found a little something
during the examination.

101
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,875
What?

102
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,833
- Well, a slight irregularity with my breathing.
- How slight?

103
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:26,759
I'm sure it's nothing significant
but I need to get it looked at.

104
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,918
Well, then let's hope it's just enough
to prevent you from going back in.

105
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,235
- Be careful what you wish for.
- Mm-hm.

106
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,597
MRS CAMERON: Ladies,
none of us should be under any illusion

107
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:59,155
about the prospect of imminent war
with Germany.

108
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:01,794
If and when hostilities break out,

109
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,115
there will be much to be done

110
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:07,789
to ensure that our homes
and families are protected

111
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,389
from the trials and tribulations
the war will inevitably bring.

112
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,715
And it is for this reason

113
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,673
that your committee proposes
the Institute closes its doors

114
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:22,396
until we can raise our flag again
in a time of peace.

115
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:23,919
(Muttering)

116
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,674
Oi! Argh!

117
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:50,270
It needn't be for long.

118
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:53,790
The government assures us,
if and when they begin,

119
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,276
hostilities could be over by Christmas.

120
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,673
Madam President.

121
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,633
Few who lived through the last conflict
will set much store by government assurances

122
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,592
that any war against Germany
will be over swiftly.

123
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:08,200
- Mrs Barden...
- When war <i>does</i> begin,

124
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,358
it will hurl us all into a
period of great change.

125
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,518
Something you, Madam President,
have proven steadfastly resistant to

126
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,755
over the course of your term in office.

127
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,632
Mrs Collingborne,
would you kindly control your sister?

128
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,753
As you know, Madam President,
that isn't as straightforward as you imply.

129
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,028
(Giggling)

130
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:32,351
(Groaning)

131
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,916
Ooh. Can you help me up?

132
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:40,032
Blimey... what happened to you?

133
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,071
Army lorry.

134
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:44,917
- Ow.
- Ooh.

135
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,556
- Ohh...
- Oh!

136
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,874
Sorry.

137
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:53,514
- Are you all right?
- I'm late.

138
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,393
Where are you going?

139
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:59,955
I am more than willing
to put my proposition to the vote.

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,069
(Murmuring)

141
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,190
Any objections to that, Mrs Barden?

142
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,789
Only that the membership has been
so tightly managed over the years

143
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:10,276
it will almost certainly deliver
whatever you ask of it.

144
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:17,272
Shame on you for not sharing my faith
in our colleagues' independence of mind.

145
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,039
Shame... on... you.

146
00:09:23,840 --> 00:09:26,798
If we walk slower,
it might not hurt so much.

147
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,152
I can't walk slower, Mr Wilson. I'm late.

148
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:35,159
Well, why don't we leave your bike here...

149
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,913
...and I'll get you to where you need to be
double quick on the back of mine?

150
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:43,718
- Sure you can carry me?
- You're no heavier than a bag of mail.

151
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,875
Charming.

152
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,151
- A small, light, bag of mail.
- Mm.

153
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,475
Uncommonly pretty eyes.

154
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,397
Oh.

155
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,670
- Ow. Ooh.
- Are you all right?

156
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,711
Ow. Ow.

157
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,397
- 13.
- (Low chatter)

158
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,352
WOMAN: Nail-biting stuff, this is, isn't it?

159
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,908
Ladies...

160
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,758
it is with some surprise...

161
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,711
I announce the vote to be...

162
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:19,115
- a tie.
- (Excited chatter)

163
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,879
This means that, as President,
I have the casting...

164
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,319
So sorry I'm late!

165
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,789
Uh...

166
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:29,316
...bit of an accident on my bike, Mrs...

167
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,354
...Madam President.

168
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,992
You haven't voted yet, have you?

169
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,758
Indeed we have, Claire.

170
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,918
The vote was a tie
which means that I have the casting vote.

171
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,030
With all due respect, Madam President...

172
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:44,957
And I cast my vote...

173
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:50,670
...in favour of closing the Institute
for the duration of the hostilities.

174
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,517
But...

175
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,551
But I'm here now.

176
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,079
And it's lovely to see you.

177
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,509
But, alas, I'm afraid too
late for you to vote.

178
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:03,838
I respect what you said about loyalty
this morning, Mrs Cameron...

179
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,834
...Madam President.

180
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,759
If I were you, I would think very carefully
about what you're about to say, young lady.

181
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,950
Feel free to speak your mind, Miss Hillman.

182
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,632
You're among friends here.

183
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,517
I'm not ashamed to say
the thought of war scares me.

184
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,510
It terrifies me, if I'm honest.

185
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,635
But that's why I need this.

186
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,992
You.

187
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,435
I feel very strongly the
Institute should stay open.

188
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,471
(Whispering)

189
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,112
So that's how I would've voted.

190
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,472
That's all very well, Miss Hillman.
But I'm afraid the vote is closed.

191
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:54,875
A President's casting
vote should only be used

192
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,956
when there is a genuine deadlock.

193
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,991
If Miss Hillman hadn't been waylaid,

194
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,031
then she would have been present to vote.

195
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,911
Yes, but she <i>was</i> waylaid.

196
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:05,952
And the vote <i>was</i> taken.
And it <i>was</i> a tie.

197
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,515
And, consequently, I had the deciding vote.

198
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,028
If you don't allow Miss
Hillman's vote to count,

199
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:16,153
I shall have little choice but to call
a vote of no confidence in the President.

200
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:19,192
This could have far-reaching consequences,
Mrs Barden.

201
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,119
The President is, after all,
elected by the members,

202
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,390
and I urge you to think very carefully...

203
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,908
I demand a vote of no confidence
in the President!

204
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,155
(Low chatter)

205
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:38,000
I have served this branch to the best
of my ability for six long years...

206
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,271
I'm sorry, but I absolutely demand it.

207
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,910
...and I categorically refuse
to be subjected to this indignity,

208
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,837
and hereby...

209
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,395
offer my immediate resignation.

210
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,908
(Muttering)

211
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,554
- They'll come back.
- I don't think they will.

212
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,352
Well done, Frances.

213
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,154
Well, one way or another you've handed Joyce
exactly what she wanted.

214
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,831
(Thunder rumbling)

215
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,314
- What's up with your arm?
- Sh.

216
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,676
- It's fine.
- Steph.

217
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,711
(Thunder rumbling)

218
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,991
Show me.

219
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,950
- Agh!
- Bloody hell, love.

220
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,718
- It's nothing.
- That's a cow-kick.

221
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:26,239
It's my own fault.

222
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,670
I was in a hurry to finish milking
so I could get in and dry off.

223
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,837
That's a bad one. If it's no easier
by morning, I'll call Dr Campbell.

224
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,996
Don't be such an old woman.

225
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,151
WIRELESS: <i>Now a special announcement</i>.

226
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:47,718
<i>The German government announced tonight
their response to a British communication</i>

227
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,673
<i>and gave their proposals
for a settlement of the Polish problem. It...</i>

228
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,711
(Gate shuts)

229
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,671
(Keys rattle)

230
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,438
(Door closes)

231
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,915
- Where's Dad?
- In front of the fire.

232
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,756
- Kettle done?
- Not for an hour or so.

233
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,392
Right.

234
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,312
I've come to a decision, Ma.

235
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,799
What about?

236
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,314
Enlisting.

237
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,230
- What?
- All the lads are talking about it.

238
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,396
Well, <i>you</i> can't enlist.

239
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,557
- You can't stop me when I'm 17.
- You're forgetting one thing...

240
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,636
- Neither can Dad.
- I'm not talking about him.

241
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,477
I'm talking about your condition.

242
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,273
If Doc Campbell gave me the all clear,
so will the Navy.

243
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:53,396
- The Navy?
- As soon as I'm 17, I'm going to join the Navy.

244
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,952
Have you told your dad any of this?

245
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,991
No, he fell asleep before I could.

246
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,675
My mind's made up, Ma.

247
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,836
It's what I want.

248
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,790
I'll see you in the morning.

249
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:28,511
(Sobbing)

250
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,391
(Ticking)

251
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:41,150
We need to order a new stethoscope.
I suspected it was on the way out.

252
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:44,636
Just tried it on myself
and it appears I'm already dead.

253
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,636
I'll do it first thing.

254
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,877
I might order a couple,
before they all get requisitioned by the Army.

255
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,673
- No need to rub it in.
- Not meaning to.

256
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,836
Just pleased on an ongoing basis.

257
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:57,189
- (Door shuts)
- You're back early.

258
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,151
We were thrown out of the cinema.

259
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:02,033
This old chap was constantly sneezing,
disturbing everyone,

260
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,877
so Laura had a quiet word.

261
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:08,311
I politely suggested that if he was so unwell,
the cinema wasn't the best place for him.

262
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,396
Sound medical advice. Good for you.

263
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:12,954
He spluttered off to the manager,
who threw us out.

264
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,911
Though I told him that if we <i>did</i> go to war,

265
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:18,350
I hoped the first German bomb
dropped on England would land on his cinema.

266
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,870
- That's a terrible thing to have said.
- Not with anyone in it!

267
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,434
- So you're banned from the cinema now?
BOTH: For life!

268
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,590
- Come on.
- I'm starving.

269
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,396
Aren't you pleased to be able to stay at home

270
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,671
to see those two banned
from every cinema in Cheshire?

271
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,870
What every father dreams of.

272
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,351
(Sheep bleating)

273
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,151
(Low drone of aeroplane engines)

274
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:56,990
(Clucking)

275
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,078
How is it?

276
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:25,669
We need to keep the arm in this position
for a couple of days.

277
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,950
After that, you can take the sling off,

278
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:31,072
but you must look after it
until the pain has completely gone.

279
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,396
- She's lucky it's not broken.
- "She"? I'm not one of the bloody cows.

280
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,589
- My apologies.
- Dad?

281
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,349
Bad enough Stan being in two minds
whether to call out you or the vet.

282
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:43,234
No point in telling you
to take a few days off work, I suppose?

283
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:47,319
I like a man who can answer his own questions.
Saves me from stating the obvious.

284
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,794
- Look after her.
- Mm. Fresh straw and everything.

285
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,035
You think he's joking.

286
00:18:57,560 --> 00:19:01,553
- Have you spoken to him?
- If this is what he wants we can't stop him.

287
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:04,319
- You forgotten how old he is?
- I was a year younger.

288
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,157
If you were my son I'd have stopped you.

289
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,236
You wouldn't have had the option.

290
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:11,158
Young men are drawn to war
like moths to flame, Mim.

291
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,476
- It's their chance to prove themselves.
- Or be blown to pieces trying.

292
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,432
From a bullet or regret -
more than one way to die.

293
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,153
Spare me the "glory of the battlefield", Bryn.

294
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,876
It took us years to get through it.

295
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,877
You still can't pour a jug with a steady hand.

296
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,596
That said, I'd sooner have gone than not.

297
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,200
- David isn't ready.
- No-one is. You're not listening.

298
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:37,516
It's not a choice. Not for most.

299
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,158
(Sizzling)

300
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:50,879
Well, now your precious Institute's closed,
perhaps I'll have your full attention.

301
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:53,354
- You've always had my full attention, Bob.
- No, no.

302
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,595
Your mind is frequently elsewhere

303
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,551
when it should be focused on ensuring

304
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,114
that the only breadwinner in the house
is looked after.

305
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,358
But if you'd allow me to work, I could help
alleviate some of the financial worry.

306
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,879
We've had this conversation.

307
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:09,196
- But...
- Yeah, but we've had this conversation. Yes?

308
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,071
Mm.

309
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:35,750
Why aren't you having any?

310
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:38,796
There's only enough bacon for one.

311
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,156
(Clattering)

312
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:52,992
You have it.

313
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,431
Hands and knees, Pat.

314
00:20:57,760 --> 00:20:59,751
I'm waiting.

315
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,634
(Birdsong)

316
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,477
MIRIAM: I'm begging you to help me.

317
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,317
After you gave David the all clear,

318
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,477
he went down the recruitment office
to find out about signing up.

319
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,750
When the time comes,
they'll give him a medical

320
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:15,110
and if they find anything relating to asthma,
they won't take him.

321
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:16,878
Tell them he's got it.

322
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:19,878
- David is a young man...
- He's not a young man!

323
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:24,357
- He's a boy! A 16-year-old child.
- I understand how you must be feeling.

324
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,315
You have two daughters who'll never see action!
You can't possibly understand how I'm feeling.

325
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,759
All I'm asking
is you write to the recruitment office

326
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,394
and tell them that David
has a history of chronic asthma.

327
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,590
But, Miriam, he doesn't.

328
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,269
It's acute at best and has, thankfully,
been on the wane for a number of years.

329
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,959
- They don't need to know that!
- That's quite enough!

330
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,595
With all due respect, Erica,
this is between me and Dr Campbell.

331
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:49,835
Will has looked after your
family for many years.

332
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:52,110
He has great affection for you all,

333
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,549
but you're asking him to
commit a malpractice.

334
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,397
He can't possibly do that.

335
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,236
I sympathise. I really do.

336
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,280
But you'll do nothing.

337
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,635
- I can't do what you're asking.
- If they take him, my son will die.

338
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,875
Miriam, I think you should leave now.

339
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:18,237
Save my child.

340
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,599
(Outer door slams)

341
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,350
She won't be the last.

342
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,630
The County Organiser thought
we had little choice but to close

343
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,797
due to catastrophic loss of membership.

344
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:55,558
She had been in touch with Joyce

345
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,151
but Joyce has refused to return,
which means none of her supporters will either.

346
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:05,513
She suggested we join our nearest Institute
for the duration.

347
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:08,836
Did she explain how we're meant to cover
16 miles there and back on bicycle?

348
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,350
At night, with military vehicles
charging all over the place?

349
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,879
She did not.

350
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,912
So that's it.

351
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:20,428
Either way, Joyce has got what she wanted.

352
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,599
The closure of the WI.

353
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,757
Well, then, not if we attract more members.

354
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,995
How are we going to do that?

355
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,876
In all honesty, I've no idea.

356
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,630
But that doesn't mean we give up.

357
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,114
- I should be getting back.
- And me.

Then I acted on impulse...
and made the situation intractably worse.

- Is there something else?
- I just want to thank you...

369
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,758
for letting me come and work here
after Mrs Cameron let me go.

370

Well, we couldn't stand by
and see you suffer for speaking your mind.

You're very welcome here, Claire.

00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:49,872
I can practically hear the pistons of
frustration pounding in your head.

397
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:52,878
I'm not wasting any more mental energy
on that woman.

398
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,395
But I am thinking about
how we might resurrect the Institute.

399
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,997
Might not mothballing be for the best
for the time being?

400
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,554
Given that everyone's looking inwards now.

401
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,318
On the contrary.

402
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,318
War can be very isolating.

403
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:14,795
The Institute would provide women
with a sense of community and purpose

404
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,593
- while their men are away.
- I understand that, but...

405
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,198
Sh, sh, sh, sh, sh.

406
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,719
Look.

407
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,439
What would Alison do without the WI?

408
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,799
I'll tell you.

409
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,070
She works all the hours God gives.

410
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:31,192
Without the WI to get her out of the house
once a month,

411
00:27:31,240 --> 00:27:34,949
her life would almost entirely
consist of accounts and that dog.

412
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,272
The bushes are dripping
with blackberries this year.

413
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:40,435
Mm?

414
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,038
I couldn't help noticing.

415
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:47,630
You can see them even in moonlight.

416
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,191
Are you all right?

417
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:02,677
What an absolutely brilliant man you are.

418
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:09,199
In four days, Alison will commemorate
the loss of her George

419
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:13,153
in a North Atlantic convoy 23 years ago...

420
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:17,350
...his name carved for ever
onto the village war memorial.

421
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,790
The very first fatality of the Great War
was a merchant seaman.

422
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:27,434
In all likelihood, the very first
fatality of this war will be one too,

423
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,153
sailing the same route for the same reason -

424
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,634
to keep this nation supplied with food.

425
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:37,151
Which is why every pound of fruit
we preserve as jam

426
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,352
is a pound that won't need to be shipped here
through treacherous waters.

427
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,313
To that end, I've made a
survey of the local area

428
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,839
and put together this map

429
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,111
of all the blackberry hedgerows
in and around the village boundary.

430
00:28:51,160 --> 00:28:53,879
Our aim must be to collect it all.

431
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,629
- Frances...
- We never made jam under Joyce Cameron.

432
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,433
She thought it was too downmarket for her WI.

433
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,074
By making it now, it would serve as a signal

434
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:07,557
to all the women of Great Paxford
who felt excluded by Joyce and her crowd.

435
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:12,276
It would be a line in the sand
between the old Institute and the new.

436
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,788
A line in the sand made of jam!

437
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:16,193
(Laughter)

438
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,708
- There's miles of it.
- And very few of us.

439
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,320
We can't be daunted at the first hurdle.

440
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,948
Others will answer the call. I'm sure of it.

441
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,353
When?

442
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,436
Why, have faith, ladies.

443
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,191
Hold fast.

444
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,478
Look at this. It's for the Women's Institute.

445
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:49,756
Oh, yes? Oh, it does sound good.

446
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,438
Mr Farrow?

447
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,439
Mr Farrow.

448
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,679
What's this?

449
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:03,714
"Women of Great Paxford, join us for a harvest
of blackberries for the purpose of making jam."

450
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,957
"For the purpose of making jam."
Why not just say, "to make jam"?

451
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:09,309
- They know how to make it sound better.
- Bollocks.

452
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,873
Unlike you.

453
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,878
"This will be a small part
of our planned contribution

454
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,115
to the nation's food
supply in the event of war

455
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:20,039
and a re-launch of the village Women's
Institute following its recent closure.

456
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,199
ALL welcome."

457
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,077
"All" in capital letters.

458
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:28,237
- What do you reckon?
- What, baking cakes and arranging flowers?

459
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:30,919
- It's not for me.
- This doesn't mention cakes or flowers.

460
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:33,269
But it does say "all" in capital letters.

461
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,037
Not for me.

462
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,199
You should go...
for the purpose of getting out more.

463
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:44,958
Leave it, Stanley, all right.

464
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,195
- Move out...
- Right.

- That's not mine.
- It is.

477
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,074
Fixed the brakes, replaced the chain,
cleaned and oiled the gears.

478

Added a nice new basket.

Repaired your saddle, changed both tyres,
refitted new inner tubes,

and... cleaned and polished your frame.

Why not?

556
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,516

557
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:20,078
Try that.

558
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,797
Mm. Delicious!

559
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:27,319
What did <i>you</i> do?

560
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,509
I...

561
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,958
...added the delicious.

562
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,236
- Spencer!
- Jenny!

563
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,589
Are you taking me for that drink, or what?

564
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,753
- Would you like to try our jam?
- No, thanks. Looks awful.

565

Probably riddled with bits of wasp.

567
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,955
Each pot includes an invitation
to join our new Women's Institute.

568
00:38:50,560 --> 00:38:52,835
Do I look like someone who'd join the WI?

569
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,190
Well, possibly not the old one,
but the new one might entice even you.

570
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,276
Come on, Spence. I'm parched.

571
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,869
I didn't have him down as a wolf.

572
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,992
Welcome home, Bob.

573
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,315
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

574
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:15,590
I have him now, gentlemen.
Thank you so much.

575
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:17,631
Quite all right.

576
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,911
Go steady.

577
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,511
How are you feeling?

578
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:42,630
You mean, after you poisoned me?

579
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:45,035
I didn't realise the fish was on the turn.

580
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:48,188
Because you were too busy
with your damned Institute.

581
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,719
No.

582
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,476
Why are you all dressed up?

583
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:02,756
- It's the first meeting of the new...
- You're not going.

584
00:40:02,800 --> 00:40:06,998
- But...
- I need you to look after me, yes?

585
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:09,869
Yes.

586
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:12,070
That's all you have to do, Patricia.

587
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,189
Look... after... me.

588
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,591
(Cup and saucer gently rattling)

589
00:40:48,760 --> 00:40:50,910
No-one else is coming, are they?

590
00:40:51,600 --> 00:40:53,716
At least we sold all the jam.

591
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:56,479
Proves people's sense of patriotism
is alive and well.

592
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,750
- True.
- (Door opens)

593
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,440
- Am I late?
- No. Not at all.

594
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:10,155
Everyone... This is Miss Fenchurch,
our school's new teacher.

595
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,952
- Hello.
- How do you do?

596
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:13,228
Hello.

597
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,989
- Can she not speak?
- Oh, on the contrary...

598
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,553
(Whispers) Behind you.

599
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:23,071
Only you.

600
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,599
I thought as much.

601
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:27,029
Hardly the making of a new Institute.

602
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,670
Oh, excuse me!

603
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,476
I thought I'd come and have a look.

604
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,558
- Is the meeting still on?
- Not noticeably.

605
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:42,239
It is... inasmuch as <i>we're</i> here.

606
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:44,555
I'll just get the girls off the trailer.

607
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:45,749
The girls?

608
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,671
It's on, girls!

609
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,950
- Right, that's us!
- Ooh!

610
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,560
Come on, girls, park yourselves.

611
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,955
I hope you don't mind.
I mentioned it to some women.

612
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,434
No, of course not.
The more the merrier.

613
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:01,631
You say that now.
Come on, ladies, quick as you like.

614
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:02,954
(Chatter)

615
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,948
Are you staying or leaving, Mrs Cameron?

616
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,638
This will fail, Mrs Collingborne.

617
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,830
Lowering standards never works.

618
00:42:12,880 --> 00:42:14,359
The only thing that's failed

619
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:17,392
is your determined attempt
to keep this Institute

620
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,557
at the preserve of
your favoured snobs and sycophants.

621
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,559
But then that, like so much else,
is about to change.

622
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:28,388
Now, if you're willing to change with us,
then you are very welcome to stay...

623
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,352
When I want a homily
on the "joys of transformation",

624
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:34,676
I'll listen to the organ grinder
in church on Sunday...

625
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:38,432
...not his monkey at the village hall midweek.

626
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:43,153
Enjoy the company of your new friends
while you can.

627
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:45,555
This - whatever this purports to be -
can't survive.

628
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:47,318
It doesn't purport to be anything.

629
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:51,751
It <i>is</i> Great Paxford's new Women's Institute.

630
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:54,109
If you say so, Mrs Collingborne.

631
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:56,599
Good evening.

632
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:59,108
FRANCES: You are most welcome!

633
00:43:00,040 --> 00:43:01,678
Good jam, by the way.

634
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,631
Too sweet for me, but my two loved it.

635
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:05,639
I prefer damson.

636
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,148
There'll be plenty on the
trees in a week and...

637
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:10,873
We've got a spare shed
if you need to store anything.

638
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,512
That would be utterly fantastic.

639
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:17,028
I've got some other ideas
if you'd like to hear them.

640
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,072
Like to? We'd love to!

641
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,512
Ladies! Please come in.

642
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,835
You're most welcome.

643
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,911
(Clock ticking)

644
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:56,471
(Door bangs)

645
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:58,192
ERICA: I'm back!

646
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,836
At the beginning of the evening, it looked like
no-one was going to come, but by the end...

647
00:44:09,360 --> 00:44:11,828
I had a call from the consultant an hour ago.

648
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:15,076
Good doctor. Nice man.

649
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,109
And?

650
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,190
I have lung cancer, Erica.

651
00:44:24,640 --> 00:44:26,631
What?

652
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,276
Apparently, I have lung cancer.

653
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:37,030
- But... But that's... that's not possible.
- They've caught it early.

654
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,594
- You haven't got cancer, Will.
- Erica.

655
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:44,036
I'm afraid I have.

656
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:53,030
But what... What do we tell the girls?

657
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,316
Until there's something they really need
to know, can't we leave them as they are?

658
00:45:00,040 --> 00:45:03,430
The whole country's in a state of
jumping the gun. Let's not follow suit.

659
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,118
We can't just continue as normal.

660
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:06,673
Yes. As normal.

661
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:08,711
Precisely that.

662
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:10,796
For as long as possible.

663
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,279
Please.

664
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:22,196
"Be careful what you wish for..."

but I only hear the voices in my head

666

they'll be calling to me
