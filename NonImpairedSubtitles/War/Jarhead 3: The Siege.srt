00:10:38,597 --> 00:10:39,927
Excuse me, Miss Winston?

163
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,267
Shane, please, it's Olivia.
How many times do I gotta tell you that?

164
00:10:43,435 --> 00:10:45,055
Right. Sure. Sorry, Miss Winston,

165
00:10:45,437 --> 00:10:48,057
I want y'all to meet
the new Marine here, Corporal Albright.

166
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:49,572
Miss Winston.

167
00:10:50,067 --> 00:10:51,277
What's with you jarheads, huh?

168
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:55,111
Miss Winston is a digital security
director. She gets you in the system.

169
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,414
I look forward to working with you, ma'am.

170
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,408
You keep calling me ma'am, Hoosier boy,

171
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,163
and you're not
gonna be working anywhere much longer.

172
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,327
Hoosier. You did your homework.

173
00:11:03,622 --> 00:11:05,042
Of course. We have to
run a background check

174
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,922
before you ever even get here,

175
00:11:07,042 --> 00:11:08,962
but maybe with you
we should check you again.

176
00:11:09,586 --> 00:11:10,626
Maybe.

177
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,091
Over 64 inches tall,
more than 18 months' time on station,

178
00:11:14,216 --> 00:11:16,296
first class PFT, financially stable,

179
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:19,805
38 months
obligated service, and you're single.

180
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:22,390
Like a rolling stone, ma'am.

181
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:26,439
Yeah, you're all clear.

182
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,560
Aside from that high level of maturity,

183
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:30,355
judgment and sound moral character part.

184
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,074
That part we might
still need to work on a little.

185
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:35,485
I'll look forward to it, ma'am.

186
00:11:35,571 --> 00:11:36,821
I'll bet you will.

187
00:11:36,905 --> 00:11:37,945
Okay.

188
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,413
You're so barking
up the wrong tree right there, my friend.

189
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:44,120
Many have tried and many have failed.

190
00:11:44,204 --> 00:11:45,334
-I do like a challenge.
-Whoa.

191
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:46,865
Hey, hey, boys. Um...

192
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:48,792
Great. Can I just ask you a few questions?

193
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:50,786
I'm shooting footage for the embassy blog.

194
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:51,836
You work here?

195
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,340
Yeah, Blake Laureano.
I work for the Ambassador.

196
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:55,474
Hey, you're filming this?

197
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:57,179
I'm filming everything.
Everything and everyone.

198
00:11:57,259 --> 00:12:00,349
Just getting some thoughts on how it feels to
work a world away from home.

199
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:03,139
What have you learned so far? Anything?

200
00:12:03,182 --> 00:12:06,062
Worship the Ambassador,
learn to like playing video games,

201
00:12:06,185 --> 00:12:08,195
guard Post One, avoid the RSO,

202
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:09,980
and don't try to date the cute computer lady

203
00:12:10,022 --> 00:12:11,652
because that's apparently a lost cause.

204
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,819
That's awesome. I gotta go.

205
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,815
Yeah, so do we.

206
00:12:24,036 --> 00:12:27,706
There he is. In the flesh. Ambassador Cahill.

207
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:28,959
CAHILL: Please, take a seat.

208
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,501
You ever talk to him?

209
00:12:30,542 --> 00:12:31,712
Yeah, man. All the time.

210
00:12:32,336 --> 00:12:36,046
"Yes, Mr. Ambassador. No, Mr. Ambassador.
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador."

211
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,380
Practice that and you'll be fine.

212
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,552
-Tracking.
-All right.

213
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,300
Then you're ready.

214
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:44,557
For what?

215
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,720
For why you're wearing blues.

216
00:12:46,475 --> 00:12:47,485
Your first mission.

217
00:12:49,853 --> 00:12:51,603
CAHILL: ...that I did not have new shoes.

218
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,320
My parents said that we didn't have
enough money for new shoes.

219
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:58,738
And that made me sad.

220
00:12:58,904 --> 00:13:00,244
But then one day,

221
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:03,784
I met a new friend who said
he liked my old shoes.

222
00:13:04,243 --> 00:13:09,503
That's when I realized that new friendships
were better than new shoes.

223
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:12,377
Great. Well, thank you very much.

224
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:18,973
That's okay. Thanks.
It's great to see you. Thank you for coming.

225
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,377
And thank you, ma'am.

226
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,470
(CHUCKLING) Good
to see you. Thanks very much. Well done.

227
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:24,644
Thank you.

228
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,221
So, day two in the Kingdom,
correct, Corporal Albright?

229
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:28,266
Yes, Mr. Ambassador.

230
00:13:28,392 --> 00:13:29,562
Well, nice job.

231
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,233
You'd be surprised
how far a bit of compassion goes.

232
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,814
Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

233
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,734
All right, kids. Let's go.
Let's get some ice cream.

234
00:13:41,113 --> 00:13:44,283
So, Stamper, tell me
what the best thing about embassy life is.

235
00:13:44,992 --> 00:13:47,992
The best thing about embassy life? Showers.

236
00:13:48,871 --> 00:13:52,001
When Sunshine comes
in with that coconut shampoo, man...

237
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:55,085
You got jokes, huh?
Man, pass me the goddamn salt, man.

238
00:13:57,588 --> 00:14:01,258
Now, look,
this is the best part about embassy life.

239
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:04,761
This right here,
this is how you never leave home

240
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:06,053
no matter where you're at.

241
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,102
-Gumbo is ready, fellas! Come and get it.
-Gumbo.

242
00:14:13,145 --> 00:14:14,655
Welcome to the bayou.

243
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,397
Oh, nah, I'm good, man.

244
00:14:17,482 --> 00:14:18,942
What?

245
00:14:19,026 --> 00:14:20,606
I'm allergic to gluten. So...

246
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:22,653
Uh, you're allergic to gluten, huh?

247
00:14:23,071 --> 00:14:25,281
-Man, get your ass outta here, man.
-Hey, hey, man!

248
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:26,777
-(LAUGHING)
-Allergic to gluten.

249
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:19,920
BLAKE: Okay, okay.
Now, tell us, why did you join the Marines?

250
00:15:20,587 --> 00:15:23,757
Why do you think?
'Cause I piss red, white and blue.

251
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:26,756
My dad served and my pawpaw before him.

252
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:29,215
I'm a gunfighter raised
in a family of gunfighters.

253
00:15:30,264 --> 00:15:35,104
Seriously, man,
come on. Tell us. I want the truth.

254
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:37,815
You can't handle the truth!

255
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,685
No, another bad impersonation

256
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:40,981
of Jack Nicholson is what I can't handle.

257
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:42,863
Come on, just tell us.

258
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:48,374
I joined the Marines to prove myself.

259
00:15:50,117 --> 00:15:51,787
I joined the Marines to be the best.

260
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:53,907
(GRUNTING)

261
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:54,996
Move.

262
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,550
BLAKE: Gunny. Gunny!

263
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,342
Hey, stow that shit. We got work to do.

264
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,644
BLAKE: These guys,
they think of you as like this Marine Buddha.

265
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:13,351
What makes a great Marine?
Just give us one thing.

266
00:16:13,432 --> 00:16:14,642
-You really wanna know?
-Yeah.

267
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:16,774
High-fiber cereal.

268
00:16:16,852 --> 00:16:17,892
What?

269
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,270
Because if you don't shit right,

270
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:21,314
then you don't sleep,
walk or fight right, either.

271
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:24,691
Healthy and regular defecation,
that is the key.

272
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,825
And no, I'm not shitting you.

273
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:31,284
-What the fuck is wrong with you, man?
-ALL: Whoa, whoa, whoa...

Chill, man, chill, man. Chill.

00:16:42,461 --> 00:16:45,091
You hear it first. Sleep tight. Shit right.

will be playing the roles of the terrorists.

00:19:09,233 --> 00:19:10,363
Fuckin' hotshot.

321
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:14,704
Hey, if your ass didn't still owe me money,

322
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:17,158
I might've used a real gat on you, white boy.

323
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:19,663
HANSEN: Nobody
says "gat" anymore. It's a gun.

324
00:19:21,161 --> 00:19:23,041
Casualties might
be all right with the government

325
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:24,910
as long as their assets are safe,

326
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,708
but they are not
all right with me. Are we clear?

327
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:30,588
Roger that, Gunnery Sergeant.

328
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:33,919
You don't always have to be first, Albright.

329
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:38,215
Sometimes being
a good Marine means coming in last.

330
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:52,778
NOVESKI: Here we go, boys.

331
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:54,438
-Oh, shit.
-Here we go.

332
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:55,995
About time.

333
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,071
Here we go.

334
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,954
Okay. All right, I got Wolf Man.

335
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:02,745
You know who I got, man.

336
00:20:02,786 --> 00:20:04,196
I got Dracula.

337
00:20:04,288 --> 00:20:05,458
Stamper's got Mummy.

338
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,331
What are you talking about?

339
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:11,087
It's this little game we play, right?

340
00:20:11,628 --> 00:20:13,918
So every day,
this kid comes by selling falafels,

341
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,674
and every day one of these hajis

342
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,377
takes a bite, spills half of it on his lap.

343
00:20:19,219 --> 00:20:20,799
Protestors gotta eat, too.

344
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:25,141
Here's the drill, boys.
Next Tuesday, a new GTA comes out.

345
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:26,522
Winner gets first week king of the couch.

346
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:27,642
All right.

347
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:29,979
-Check it out. Pita time.
-Shit.

348
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:33,316
NOVESKI: Here we go.

349
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,820
Come on, Bubba Ho-tep,
you falafel gobbling high priest, you.

350
00:20:36,945 --> 00:20:39,815
-Oh, man.
-Nah, Drac's got this one today, I can feel it.

351
00:20:40,365 --> 00:20:42,615
-Hey, man, let me see those for a second.
-There you go, baby.

352
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:45,158
NOVESKI: There you go. Come on, bitch.
LOPEZ: No, come on, man.

353
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:47,911
NOVESKI: No, no, no, no.
Drac's got this one today.

354
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:49,498
-Take a bite.
-LOPEZ: Come on, Wolfie. Come on.

355
00:20:49,583 --> 00:20:51,003
STAMPER: That's what you need.
LOPEZ: Not good.

356
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,464
-No. Uh-uh. Man.
-STAMPER: There you go.

357
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:54,093
-Hold up.
-STAMPER: That's what I'm talking about.

358
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,801
-No, Wolfie's gonna come through.
-Come on, baby.

359
00:20:55,881 --> 00:20:57,171
LOPEZ: No. No!
STAMPER: Get some.

360

(STAMPER WHOOPING)

361
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,182
-Fuck.
-King of the couch, bitches.

362
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:04,010
Holy shit, I've seen that guy before.

363
00:21:04,348 --> 00:21:05,428
What the hell are you talking about?

364
00:21:05,516 --> 00:21:06,886
That cameraman,
I think he was just filming us.

365
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:08,057
What cameraman?

366
00:21:11,355 --> 00:21:12,865
Oh, man. No, that's just somebody with,

367
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,440
I don't know, Al Jazeera or something.

368
00:21:14,525 --> 00:21:16,615
Trying to get the people's
perspectives, you know.

369
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:19,493
No, he was watching us,
the gate, not them, not the protestors.

370
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:23,121
It's the same guy I saw
watching me and Hansen when I first got in.

371
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,870
STAMPER: Bullshit.
How do you figure you can tell one

372
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:26,622
of these fucking rag heads from another?

373
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:27,793
I can tell.

374
00:21:27,871 --> 00:21:30,831
FNG still trying to
catch the bad guys, trying to be a big hero.

375
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,085
Hotshot looking to get shot.

376
00:21:33,544 --> 00:21:34,634
-You're damn right.
-I don't know.

377
00:21:34,711 --> 00:21:36,711
Look, Albright,
any one of these guys even thinks

378
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:37,917
about making a move for the gate,

379
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:39,166
they become targets.

380
00:21:39,258 --> 00:21:41,468
They never do. They know the drill, man.

381
00:21:42,177 --> 00:21:43,547
Why don't you chill out and grab a beer?

382
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:46,512
LOPEZ: That's bullshit, right there.

383
00:21:46,557 --> 00:21:48,217
-That ain't even in his lap.
-It's like almost a...

384

STAMPER: My cushion's on that couch, baby.

385
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,520
NOVESKI: I got your couch right here, baby.

386
00:21:51,562 --> 00:21:53,522
LOPEZ: Bullshit, man.
STAMPER: Look, take your ass downstairs,

387
00:21:53,564 --> 00:21:54,734
go clean my couch.

388
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,728
And you're positive?

389
00:21:58,235 --> 00:22:00,205
There were no camera crews
near the US Embassy?

390
00:22:01,697 --> 00:22:02,777
Thank you.

391
00:22:34,563 --> 00:22:36,273
Can we get the tribal leaders
from all sides there?

392
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,936
Excuse me, Mr. Ambassador, sir?

393
00:22:38,025 --> 00:22:39,575
Yes, Corporal Albright.

394
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,743
I thought you might wanna have a look at this.

395
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:43,448
I think I saw
this guy filming the perimeter outside.

396
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:51,045
You think so or you know so?

397
00:22:51,622 --> 00:22:54,122
Well, I think so. He was at a distance, but...

398
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:55,789
So you're not 100% sure?

399
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:57,840
100% sir? No.

400
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,050
All right. Well, you must be mistaken.

401
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,130
But I called all the news stations in the area

402
00:23:02,174 --> 00:23:03,804
and none of them
had a film crew anywhere near here.

403
00:23:04,968 --> 00:23:06,848
And what did Raines or Kraus have to say?

404
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:09,812
I thought you'd wanna see it first, sir.

405
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:15,096
I'm aware of the potential dangers
of working here

406
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:16,475
and I know there's a lot of people

407
00:23:16,522 --> 00:23:18,692
who wanna destroy
the trust we've built up in the region.

408
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,935
But my job here is to build bridges,

409
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:23,148
and people trust me to do my job.

410
00:23:23,654 --> 00:23:25,994
You have to trust
the people around you to do theirs.

411
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:29,201
-You understand?
-Yes, sir.

412
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:30,696
All right. Good man.

413
00:23:30,786 --> 00:23:32,446
All right, Rashmi,
I want you to be there as well.

414
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:34,456
It's very important that we see that a woman

415
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:36,368
can be there working on this project.

416
00:23:45,759 --> 00:23:47,639
EVAN: I'm telling you,
I know what I saw. It's bullshit.

417
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:49,885
LOPEZ: But you need to chill, all right?

418
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:53,020
That's why I brought you
out here, to get your mind off bullshit.

419
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,266
-Hold on a second.
-Let's go eat. I'm starving.

420
00:24:00,691 --> 00:24:02,071
And what do you think, man? Which one?

421
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:04,360
I don't know. For your daughter?

422
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,030
No, man, for me. You see, I was thinking

423
00:24:07,197 --> 00:24:08,867
of sipping some malt liquor later, so.

424
00:24:09,283 --> 00:24:10,453
Hey, she's gonna be 16 one day.

425
00:24:10,534 --> 00:24:11,874
Maybe you should get her
one of those burkas.

426
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:16,116
You're an asshole, man, you know that?

427
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:17,833
Yeah, I know.

428
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:21,672
I think I'm gonna get her this. She'll like this.

431
00:25:09,176 --> 00:25:10,886
You think there's a threat,

432
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:15,178
then you're supposed
to let me or RSO Kraus know, follow protocol.

433
00:25:16,808 --> 00:25:18,178
You went straight to the Ambassador.

434
00:25:19,478 --> 00:25:23,308
I'm... I'm sorry,
Gunnery Sergeant. I just thought...

435
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,940
No, that's just it. You didn't think, did you?

436
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:30,454
Look, we get reports
like this here or worse on a daily,

437
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:33,412
but now Kraus
is so pissed you went over his head with it,

438
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:36,164
he's probably not even
gonna take it seriously, and that's on you.

439
00:25:36,286 --> 00:25:38,036
-That's bullshit.
-No. You're bullshit.

440

All you care about is yourself and trying

441

to be some kind of goddamn rock star.

00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,630
I know your story, Albright.

446
00:25:51,510 --> 00:25:54,930
Never knew your dad, your mom OD'd,

447
00:25:55,389 --> 00:25:57,099
bounced in and out of foster care,

You were always getting your ass kicked

450
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:03,905
so you learned to kick ass back. Am I right?

451
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:06,317
It was just you, wasn't it?

452
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:08,652
You against the world.

453
00:26:10,696 --> 00:26:13,316
Well, it can't be just you no more, Albright.

454
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:15,412
Not here.

455
00:26:17,286 --> 00:26:18,366

463

Huh?

464
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:44,523
You better figure out what you really want,

465
00:26:44,563 --> 00:26:46,063
Marine, you better figure it out quick.

467
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:54,285

with Raines and the boys today?

you see the error of your ways.

Now, I don't know what I know anymore.

479
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:46,585
Yeah, well, his name is Khaled al-Asiri.

480
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:49,497
He was the leader of the local militant
group with loose ties to ISIS,

481
00:27:49,628 --> 00:27:52,548
was the mastermind behind countless
jihadi attacks throughout the Kingdom.

482
00:27:52,589 --> 00:27:54,339
Just last month he used his little brother

483
00:27:54,424 --> 00:27:57,474
as a suicide bomber
to blow up a mall in the northern territories.

484
00:27:57,678 --> 00:27:59,218
Killed 60 innocent people.

that it wasn't him I saw, then?

488
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:06,903
Because he was taken out in
a drone strike two weeks ago.

00:39:47,346 --> 00:39:48,636
I'm 100% now, sir.

636
00:39:51,475 --> 00:39:52,735
Sir, we need to go.

637
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:53,976
Safe room.

638
00:39:58,023 --> 00:39:59,023
Last man.

639
00:39:59,983 --> 00:40:01,193
Clear!

640
00:40:09,785 --> 00:40:12,205
Backup was asked for,
but they seem real hesitant

641
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:13,747
to wanna throw anybody else in this fire.

642
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:16,003
That's Pete Raines's post?

643
00:40:16,083 --> 00:40:17,753
Yes, sir, it is, and Ambassador Cahill's house.

644
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,670
Does he have any backup?
Any players in the game down there?

645
00:40:20,754 --> 00:40:22,344
No, sir. Just some embassy Marines.

646
00:40:24,174 --> 00:40:25,684
-Security guards?
-Yes, sir.

647
00:40:25,759 --> 00:40:27,679
Most with limited to no combat experience.

648
00:40:29,429 --> 00:40:31,389
They're gonna get an ass-full now.

649
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:32,523
Where's Captain Dekard?

650
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:34,348
The infirmary, sir. He's got appendicitis.

651
00:40:35,227 --> 00:40:36,477
(SIGHING) Roger that.

652
00:40:37,104 --> 00:40:38,654
Well, I guess I'm gonna take his seat, then.

653
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:40,690
Sir?

654
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:42,686
You're gonna lead the team?

655
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:44,034
You have a problem with that?

656
00:40:44,778 --> 00:40:45,858
No, sir.

657
00:40:46,113 --> 00:40:47,493
Then make the call, Hutch.

658
00:40:47,531 --> 00:40:49,371
Let me know when the helos
are ready for dust off.

659
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,330
Yes, sir.

660
00:41:00,085 --> 00:41:01,415
Hey, you're in my shot.

661
00:41:10,971 --> 00:41:12,221
Welcome to the safe room.

662
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:15,476
BLAKE: This is the safe room?
I thought it'd be bigger.

663
00:41:16,018 --> 00:41:17,848
Hansen, secure that door.

664
00:41:20,647 --> 00:41:22,267
Ronin, Ronin, this is Charlie 1.

665
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:23,897
I need to speak to your CO now.

666
00:41:28,822 --> 00:41:30,072
Who the hell is this haji?

667
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:31,869
No offense.

668
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:37,655
My name is Jamal al-Asiri
and you're right, I am one of the faithful.

669
00:41:37,956 --> 00:41:39,496
He's Khaled al-Asiri's brother.

670
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,800
They're here for you, aren't they?

671
00:41:46,882 --> 00:41:48,262
They're here for all of us.

672
00:41:48,884 --> 00:41:50,594
Yeah? Then why the hell are you here, huh?

673
00:41:51,053 --> 00:41:53,723
They said he had a meeting with
you, Mr. Ambassador. What for?

674
00:41:54,264 --> 00:41:57,524
To convince him that
our little drone attack had failed

675
00:41:57,601 --> 00:42:00,651
and to tell him that my brother is still alive,

676
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:06,365
and now my wife,
my children, my entire family is in danger.

677
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:08,450
I'm sorry, Jamal.

678
00:42:08,529 --> 00:42:11,159
All the intelligence we had assured us
that your brother was dead.

679
00:42:11,573 --> 00:42:12,703
Not all of it.

680
00:42:15,285 --> 00:42:17,285
HUTCH: (OVER RADIO) Patching you
through now, Gunnery Sergeant.

681
00:42:17,329 --> 00:42:18,329
Go for Major Lincoln.

682
00:42:18,914 --> 00:42:20,294
GUNNY: Glad to have you with us, sir.

683
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:21,882
Likewise. How bad is it?

684
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:23,634
GUNNY: It's pretty bad, sir.

685
00:42:24,253 --> 00:42:26,003
We are completely overrun and held up

686
00:42:26,088 --> 00:42:27,798
in the safe room with the Ambassador,

687
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:29,763
a few of his staff,
and a handful of my Marines.

688
00:42:30,050 --> 00:42:33,470
Roger that, Gunny.
What intel can you give me on the tangos?

689
00:42:33,929 --> 00:42:36,809
Not much. Uh, motivated, well-organized,

690
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:38,640
and kitted out for a stand-up fight.

691
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:40,939
You keep shit locked down till we get there?

692
00:42:41,937 --> 00:42:43,097
What do you mean "we," Major?

693
00:42:43,188 --> 00:42:44,308
Come on, Pete,

694
00:42:44,356 --> 00:42:45,396
you didn't think I was gonna let you have

695
00:42:45,482 --> 00:42:47,482
a party down there without me now, did you?

696
00:42:48,819 --> 00:42:50,109
Locked and loaded, then, sir.

697
00:42:50,529 --> 00:42:51,819
See you within the hour, Gunny.

698
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:55,450
Okay. MARSOC is en route.

699
00:42:55,617 --> 00:42:57,117
Mohammed said he'd get help, too.

700
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:58,664
He made it through?

701
00:42:58,787 --> 00:43:01,957
They're still an hour away.
So until then we're on our own.

702
00:43:02,624 --> 00:43:04,424
Who the hell are "they"? What's MARSOC?

703
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:06,131
Marine Corps Special Forces.

704
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:08,674
The bad asses who got our backs.

705
00:43:08,755 --> 00:43:11,835
BLAKE: And what if we're
dead in the next hour? What happens then?

706
00:43:11,884 --> 00:43:14,094
OLIVIA: Well, then we won't
need to worry about what ifs.

707
00:43:14,178 --> 00:43:15,888
CAHILL: How did this happen?

708
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:19,851
Mr. Ambassador, the room will hold.

709
00:43:19,933 --> 00:43:21,773
It's the safest place to be right now.

710
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:23,192
I can't say the rest of this place

711
00:43:23,270 --> 00:43:24,560
will still be standing around us, though.

712
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:27,020
They're going through everything.

713
00:43:30,235 --> 00:43:31,815
What the hell do they think they're doing?

714
00:43:32,029 --> 00:43:33,029
(SHOUTING)

715
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:35,322
They want to show America and its allies

716
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:37,365
the face of what they have caused.

717
00:43:39,286 --> 00:43:40,786
What,

718
00:43:40,871 --> 00:43:42,711
you think men
like my brother just woke up one day

719
00:43:42,789 --> 00:43:44,369
and decided to hate the West?

720
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:48,252
You think that they do
not feel like America is the terrorist?

721
00:43:48,337 --> 00:43:49,957
Hey, suck it, Ali Baba.

722
00:43:50,047 --> 00:43:53,217
Don't even try
to feed us that jihadi propaganda bullshit.

723
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,010
KHALED: (OVER SPEAKERS)
I know you hear me.

724
00:43:57,012 --> 00:44:00,892
I know you think
you are under attack from evil invaders.

725
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:05,195
And yet it is my home that you have invaded.

726
00:44:05,812 --> 00:44:08,482
And now you
have even invaded my own family.

727
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:11,570
My brother,

728
00:44:11,610 --> 00:44:14,030
he was a true jihadist.

729
00:44:14,363 --> 00:44:15,743
A warrior.

730
00:44:15,781 --> 00:44:18,121
Until you poisoned him.

731
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:21,914
Until our blood is no longer the same.

732
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:24,252
You hear me, brother?

733
00:44:24,623 --> 00:44:26,963
We are no longer the same.

734
00:44:27,209 --> 00:44:29,629
You are dead to the father,

735
00:44:29,711 --> 00:44:31,051
and dead to the son,

736
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:35,876
and will soon be dead to all.

737
00:44:37,594 --> 00:44:39,854
Jesus, we're in the middle
of a goddamn civil war here.

738
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:40,930
No shit.

739
00:44:42,266 --> 00:44:44,886
He knows
I provided the intel for the drone strike.

740
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:48,310
This is revenge for him against all of us.

741
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:52,864
Cause and effect, my friends.

742
00:44:53,443 --> 00:44:55,453
Sir, we need to get out there.

743
00:44:55,529 --> 00:44:56,569
What?

744
00:44:56,613 --> 00:44:59,413
What part of "safe house"
is it that you don't understand?

745
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:02,289
You saw 'em just now. They're gonna take
this place apart piece by piece.

746
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:03,949
There's still classified materials out there,

747
00:45:04,037 --> 00:45:05,617
things we haven't had the chance to get.

748
00:45:05,664 --> 00:45:07,584
Miss Winston,
there's at least 40-plus armed militants

749
00:45:07,624 --> 00:45:09,134
in between us and your office right now.

750
00:45:09,209 --> 00:45:10,499
We'll never get anywhere near it.

751
00:45:10,586 --> 00:45:11,626
He's right.

752
00:45:11,670 --> 00:45:13,050
It's not in my office.

753
00:45:13,630 --> 00:45:15,800
It's in the Ambassador's residence.

754
00:45:16,508 --> 00:45:17,798
What's in there, sir?

755
00:45:18,635 --> 00:45:19,925
Is it really that important?

756
00:45:24,141 --> 00:45:27,641
In a safe, there's Khaled al-Asiri's cell phone.

757
00:45:28,353 --> 00:45:29,353
Jamal gave it to us.

758
00:45:30,147 --> 00:45:32,437
It has information
on Khaled's entire organization.

759
00:45:32,816 --> 00:45:35,106
Names, whereabouts, plans, everything.

760
00:45:35,152 --> 00:45:39,322
It could save lives, stop the next
9/11, take down the entire group.

761
00:45:39,406 --> 00:45:41,236
We go out the south exit
at the rear of the embassy.

762
00:45:41,325 --> 00:45:42,915
It's a quick sprint from there.

763
00:45:52,085 --> 00:45:54,795
All right, boys, new plan.

764
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:55,960
Snatch and grab.

765
00:45:56,006 --> 00:45:57,466
Seriously?

766
00:45:57,508 --> 00:45:59,758
It has information
that needs to be uploaded to a data cloud

767
00:45:59,843 --> 00:46:01,263
and then wiped clean immediately.

768
00:46:01,345 --> 00:46:03,225
I'm the only person that knows how to do it.

769
00:46:04,056 --> 00:46:05,346
I'm in.

770
00:46:07,643 --> 00:46:09,193
Lopez, Hansen?

771
00:46:09,228 --> 00:46:10,728
Shit.

772
00:46:11,104 --> 00:46:12,614
What about us, sir?

773
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:14,820
Your job is to keep these people safe.

774
00:46:14,858 --> 00:46:17,688
Speaking of which,
Olivia's gonna need your vest.

775
00:46:24,993 --> 00:46:26,163
Roger that.

776
00:46:26,245 --> 00:46:27,375
That's was a Royal Guard.

777
00:46:27,496 --> 00:46:28,866
-Boots on the ground?
-Yes, sir,

778
00:46:28,956 --> 00:46:30,706
their special response regiment.

779
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:32,711
They're sending in a platoon
to back our boys up now.

780
00:46:32,793 --> 00:46:35,253
A platoon? That's it?
That's all you could get?

781
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:36,707
I couldn't get anything, sir.

782
00:46:36,755 --> 00:46:37,875
The embassy Marines did this.

783
00:46:45,973 --> 00:46:48,773
A Marine goes down on duty,
they call it an act of valor.

784
00:46:48,892 --> 00:46:52,902
A civilian at the US Embassy,
that's a national tragedy.

785
00:46:52,938 --> 00:46:56,148
Now, she's a civilian,
she's also your team now.

786
00:46:57,234 --> 00:47:00,784
It's not just you against the world no more,
Albright, it's you against them.

787
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:04,066
Hansen, on me.

788
00:47:04,157 --> 00:47:05,237
Roger.

789
00:47:51,914 --> 00:47:54,004
I got two guys out front.

790
00:48:10,933 --> 00:48:12,103
All right, Gunny, we're in place.

791
00:48:12,142 --> 00:48:13,352
(OVER RADIO) Ready to roll on your say-so.

792
00:48:13,435 --> 00:48:14,475
Roger that, stand by.

793
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:15,520
(GUNFIRE)

794
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:18,484

You know, I honestly believe that.

I have to believe that.

957

It's us.

Shit, it's probably
from the explosion on the roof.

01:03:34,064 --> 01:03:35,984
Well obviously, it's not safe anymore.

962
01:03:56,545 --> 01:03:58,465
What are you doing?

963
01:03:58,589 --> 01:04:00,129
This is classified, you shouldn't be here.

964
01:04:00,215 --> 01:04:01,755
I said, what are you doing, Olivia?

965
01:04:04,011 --> 01:04:05,011
I knew it.

966
01:04:05,596 --> 01:04:06,676
I told you, this is classified.

967
01:04:06,763 --> 01:04:09,063
You could be court-martialed
for even saying anything else.

968
01:04:09,099 --> 01:04:10,429
Hey.

969
01:04:10,475 --> 01:04:13,895
Gunny is dead. Ski is dead.
Mohammed is dead, Olivia.

970
01:04:13,937 --> 01:04:15,437
You really think I give a shit about

971
01:04:15,480 --> 01:04:16,650
being court-martialed right now?

972
01:04:17,983 --> 01:04:19,323
How much money is in there?

973
01:04:20,611 --> 01:04:22,651
It was enough to keep this place peaceful.

974
01:04:23,530 --> 01:04:25,370
So that's the Ambassador's magic touch.

975
01:04:26,074 --> 01:04:27,124
A pile of cash.

976
01:04:27,618 --> 01:04:29,788
The Ambassador's a good man, Evan.

977
01:04:29,828 --> 01:04:32,618
He was asked to come here
and cool off a hot zone, and he did that.

978
01:04:32,706 --> 01:04:35,626
Yeah, 'cause it's just breezy
around here right now, isn't it?

979
01:04:35,667 --> 01:04:38,417
Democracy's a big machine,
this keeps her wheels spinning.

980
01:04:38,879 --> 01:04:42,799

hope, and money. That's the way it works.

-And now you're just burning it?
-We don't have a choice.

982
01:04:45,886 --> 01:04:48,426
If proof of this got out,
we'd lose all credibility in the region.

983
01:04:48,472 --> 01:04:50,312
No honor amongst thieves?

984
01:04:51,141 --> 01:04:54,141
I don't have the luxury
of looking at things as black and white, Evan.

985
01:04:54,186 --> 01:04:56,266
Not out here. Nothing is.

986
01:04:56,313 --> 01:04:57,943
It's a lot easier for the world to end

987

988
01:04:59,650 --> 01:05:01,320
We make the wrong move,

989
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,320
hesitate for a second
when we shouldn't, and it's over.

Let me tell you something, Blake.

1010

If I go out here,

1011

ain't gonna be from sucking in no smoke.

rescued and I'm not waiting to die.

OLIVIA: Sunshine!

1122
01:16:04,022 --> 01:16:05,022
You're gonna be okay, man.

1123
01:16:13,323 --> 01:16:15,163
You're gonna be okay. Stay with me.

1124
01:16:16,159 --> 01:16:18,079
I got you. I got you. You're gonna be okay.

1125
01:16:18,161 --> 01:16:20,001
I got you. You're all right. You're all right.

1126
01:16:20,122 --> 01:16:21,922
You're all right. You're all right.

1127
01:16:33,010 --> 01:16:34,300
You're okay.

1128
01:16:58,076 --> 01:16:59,236
Do you see them?

1129
01:16:59,328 --> 01:17:00,538
No.

1130
01:17:07,377 --> 01:17:08,837
Do you think they're gone?

1131
01:17:08,879 --> 01:17:12,259
Trust me, they haven't gone anywhere.

1132
01:17:12,341 --> 01:17:13,721
Hansen, check the back.

1133
01:17:17,513 --> 01:17:19,563
(DISTANT GUNFIRE)

1134
01:17:22,643 --> 01:17:25,233
Yeah, that's a negative.
They're holding the alleyway.

1135
01:17:27,481 --> 01:17:28,981
There's a basement.

1136
01:17:34,488 --> 01:17:37,448
Albright to MARSOC, do you hear me? Over.

1137
01:17:39,076 --> 01:17:40,446
I don't know if you can hear me,

1138
01:17:40,536 --> 01:17:41,906
but we're pinned down. Cannot make extract.

1139
01:17:41,954 --> 01:17:43,794
-Where the fuck are we?
-At Freedom Burger.

1140
01:17:43,872 --> 01:17:45,122
Where?

1141
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:48,457
We're at Freedom Burger
on Kings Road and Al-Hashimi.

1142
01:17:54,925 --> 01:17:57,595
EVAN: Jamal, grab that propane tank.

1143
01:17:58,929 --> 01:18:01,059
-What? Why?
-Just take it to the bottom of the stairs.

1144
01:18:06,562 --> 01:18:07,772
They're back!

1145
01:18:14,778 --> 01:18:15,818
Everybody in the basement!

1146
01:18:40,971 --> 01:18:41,971
Go!

1147
01:18:50,522 --> 01:18:51,522
(SHOUTING INDISCERNIBLY)

1148
01:18:53,984 --> 01:18:55,784
Okay. I got you.

1149
01:19:03,702 --> 01:19:05,752
(SPEAKING ARABIC)

1150
01:19:43,534 --> 01:19:44,584
What the fuck!

1151
01:19:48,038 --> 01:19:49,708
Fuck!

1152
01:19:54,378 --> 01:19:56,248
I have to help them!

1153
01:19:59,258 --> 01:20:00,628
You're all right. You're gonna be all right.

1154
01:20:00,717 --> 01:20:02,047
Give me a gun. I can fight.

1155
01:20:04,221 --> 01:20:07,391
Khaled sent my younger brother,
Amir, to die when he was only 12.

1156
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,310
Now my youngest brother is only eight,

1157
01:20:11,395 --> 01:20:14,405
and I will not let him
play martyr for Khaled as well.

1158
01:20:16,900 --> 01:20:18,030
Give him a rifle.

1159
01:20:21,029 --> 01:20:22,109
Seriously, he gets a gun?

1160
01:20:22,948 --> 01:20:24,198
CAHILL: God damn it, Blake.

1161
01:20:46,805 --> 01:20:48,715
There's nowhere for you to go.

1162
01:20:49,183 --> 01:20:52,693
It seems your country will now have to
bear the burdens of your deaths.

1163
01:20:52,769 --> 01:20:54,349
Go fuck yourself.

1164
01:20:54,438 --> 01:20:57,768
After all,
that is the tragic truth of the matter, is it not?

1165
01:20:57,858 --> 01:21:01,948
Your government
takes pride in the blood that stains its hands.

1166
01:21:01,987 --> 01:21:05,527
What are yet more lives
in the pursuit of its foolish crusade?

1167
01:21:05,866 --> 01:21:07,486
Crusade?

1168
01:21:07,576 --> 01:21:09,326
You butcher
innocents and use that to get the rest

1169
01:21:09,411 --> 01:21:11,121
to go along with your savage shit.

1170
01:21:11,955 --> 01:21:15,285
You wanna bring it to us, to the devils
holding the guns, that I at least get.

1171
01:21:16,502 --> 01:21:21,382
But a shopping mall,
the towers, journalists and aid workers?

1172
01:21:21,465 --> 01:21:22,975
You're just a bunch of fucking pussies

1173
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:25,640
too weak to even
try hitting anything that might hit you back.

1174
01:21:25,719 --> 01:21:27,719
This is not that fight for freedom, Khaled.

1175
01:21:28,972 --> 01:21:32,732
This is just a fight with no end,

1176
01:21:33,393 --> 01:21:36,313
no winners and no hope.

1177
01:21:37,564 --> 01:21:40,614
The only way is to rid our land

1178
01:21:40,651 --> 01:21:43,031
of every foreigner that invades it

1179
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:47,070
and to kill the rat
who calls himself my brother.

1180
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:49,121
Go, go!

1181
01:21:58,794 --> 01:22:00,214
(YELLING)

1182
01:22:27,906 --> 01:22:29,946
(DISTANT GUNFIRE)

1183
01:22:35,289 --> 01:22:37,119
HUTCH: Cease fire.

1184
01:22:41,086 --> 01:22:42,586
At ease, Marine.

1185
01:22:53,599 --> 01:22:55,019
Ambassador Cahill.

1186
01:22:59,855 --> 01:23:01,235
Blake, put pressure on this.

1187
01:23:01,607 --> 01:23:02,607
LOPEZ: Ah!

1188
01:23:07,696 --> 01:23:09,856
LINCOLN: Major Lincoln, MARSOC.

1189
01:23:11,116 --> 01:23:12,326
Are you okay, sir?

1190
01:23:13,869 --> 01:23:16,869
Yes, Major, we are.

1191
01:23:17,623 --> 01:23:18,923
Let's get you outta here, sir.

1192
01:23:44,274 --> 01:23:45,284
(COUGHING)

1193
01:23:48,111 --> 01:23:50,741
It's for you, Miss Winston. It's Director Walsh.

1194
01:23:54,952 --> 01:23:57,622
Yes, sir. We have the package.

1195
01:23:57,871 --> 01:23:58,911
Khaled is dead.

1196
01:24:11,134 --> 01:24:12,144
BLAKE: There he is.

1197
01:24:13,178 --> 01:24:14,968
The best. Billy Badass.

1198
01:24:15,264 --> 01:24:19,984
His ass and the rest of the Marines
saved my ass in the furnace.

1199
01:24:20,060 --> 01:24:22,440
So big thank you to Albright.

1200
01:24:23,814 --> 01:24:24,984
Albright.

1201
01:24:25,941 --> 01:24:27,111
Yes, sir.

1202
01:24:28,402 --> 01:24:30,242
Hell of a job, Marine.

1203
01:24:30,320 --> 01:24:32,110
Hell of a job.

1204
01:24:32,364 --> 01:24:33,914
Your Gunny would be proud.

1205
01:24:35,033 --> 01:24:36,333
Thank you, sir.

1206
01:24:36,869 --> 01:24:39,079
You'll probably able to write
your own ticket after this.

1207
01:24:39,663 --> 01:24:42,213
Hell, I can always use
another shooter I can count on.

1208
01:24:43,292 --> 01:24:44,292
Let me know.

1209
01:24:47,296 --> 01:24:49,086
-Patrick.
-PATRICK: Sir.

1210
01:24:49,882 --> 01:24:52,342
Secure Mr. Cahill in the vehicle, please.

1211
01:24:53,177 --> 01:24:55,007
-You better take a load off, all right?
-Thank you, sir.

1212
01:25:02,936 --> 01:25:04,346
EVAN: In the end,

1213
01:25:04,438 --> 01:25:06,818
coming in first, coming in last,

1214
01:25:06,857 --> 01:25:08,527
none of it matters as long as you do right

1215
01:25:08,567 --> 01:25:10,527
by the soldiers standing next to you.

1216
01:25:11,612 --> 01:25:14,862
Ain't it fucked up how we spend so much
time planning our lives,

1217
01:25:14,907 --> 01:25:17,697
convincing ourselves with what we wanna do,

1218
01:25:17,784 --> 01:25:19,664
what we have to do?

1219
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:22,623
But sometimes, we don't see
what we're meant to do.

1220
01:25:24,124 --> 01:25:26,504
Staff Sergeant Albright?

1221
01:25:26,543 --> 01:25:28,463
New guy coming through.

1222
01:25:31,548 --> 01:25:34,758
So, Marine, how was the trip in?
