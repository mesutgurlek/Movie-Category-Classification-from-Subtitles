1
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,400
- Thank you. That will be all, Moses.
- Yes, ma'am.

2
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,000
May I have some of
those cookies, Miss Virgie?

3
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,600
Of course you may.
James Henry.

4
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,000
Serve these cookies to Master Harold
and wipe his chin.

5
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:32,200
Yes, ma'am, Miss Virgie.

6
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,000
Another portion of ice cream
for you, Miss Gladys?

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,600
No, thank you, I've had enough.

8
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:49,400
There ain't no more ice cream, Miss Virgie.

9
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,200
I'll only ask them once. I won't coax.

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,600
More cake or ice cream for you,
Master Philip?

11
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:08,400
Nothing more for me, thank you.

12
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:11,000
Would you care for more ice cream,
Master Harold?

13
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,600
Yes.

14
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,400
Perhaps you would rather have another nice,
great big piece of cake.

15
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,200
No,just ice cream.

16
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,200
Is this for me?

17
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:48,600
Course not.
Serve it to young Master Harold.

18
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,800
Seems like he could've just
reached over and took it...

19
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,200
instead of this roundabout way.

20
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,000
That child of yours
is certainly the perfect hostess.

21
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,000
She takes after her mother.

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,600
I can easily understand
why you two worship her.

23
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:15,200
I'm afraid that's a failing
common to all parents.

24
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,000
Listen, everyone. Listen!

25
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:24,000
How would you like to see Uncle Billy dance?

26
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,800
All right,James Henry.
Let's get going, son.

27
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,400
James Henry?

28
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:47,400
How about you dancing too?

29
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,600
Oh, no, ma'am, Miss Virgie.

30
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,400
The body is willing,
but the feet just stays too close to the ground.

31
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,400
Come, dear. Excuse yourself for a moment.
Some other little friends want to see you.

32
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:03,200
Will you please excuse me
for a minute?

33
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
Yes, Miss Virgie.

34
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,400
Now, you took some gumption and talk
right out to Miss Virgie. Don't be scared.

35
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,600
Hello, Sally Anne.
Hello, Dinah.

36
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,200
- Hello.
- Go on now, Sally Anne.

37
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:20,400
Miss Virgie...

38
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,200
Please, ma'am...

39
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,200
We all done come here
to wish you many happy -

40
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:29,800
- happy-
- Returns.

41
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,200
That's it!
Many happy returns of the day.

42
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:36,600
And we all done made you a doll,
and here it is.

43
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,200
Miss Virgie, there was more
I had to say, but-

44
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:44,000
Mammy, I forgot it.

45
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,600
You said everything, Sally Anne.
Don't you worry.

46
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,200
This is the very nicest present I got.
Thank you ever so much.

47
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,000
Yes, indeed, children. It was very thoughtful
and sweet. Come now, dear.

48
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,600
I'll see you later,
and I'll save you some cake.

49
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,400
We'll be waiting!

50
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,600
I hope you'll excuse me, Miss Virgie...

51
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:43,600
if I don't bow very low,
but these britches are too tight.

52
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:49,000
That's perfectly all right, Master Harold.
Just bow as far as you can.

53
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:57,000
That's far enough.
Be careful.

54
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,600
- Captain Cary?
- There's Cary.
- Here.

55
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:18,600
Fort Sumter was fired on this morning, sir.
War is declared.

56
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,400
You are to present yourself at the armory
immediately, sir, with horse and sidearms.

57
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:25,400
All men of the Richmond Graves
report in the city before nightfall.

58
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:28,800
Captain Cary, send a slave down the valley
to report the news.

59
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,200
I'm riding north among the river plantations.
Thank you, sir.

60
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,800
Hurrah!

61
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,600
Come on, boy.

62
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,800
Listen, you get the children.
I'll meet you outside at the carriage.

63
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,200
Isn't this terrible?
What are we going to do?

64
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,400
- I reckon I'd better get your things together.
- I'll leave as soon as I can.

65
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,200
Mrs. Cary, I think we ought
to get the children home.

66
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:53,600
- The road may be filled with soldiers before night.
- That's true.

67
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,800
We'll be mobilizing
tonight and tomorrow.

68
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:01,200
- Tom, get the carriages ready
as quickly as you can.
- Yes, ma'am.

69
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:08,400
Come on, darling.
We've got to hurry.

70
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,800
Good-bye, Miss Virgie.

71
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Wait for me!

72
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:24,600
Bye, Miss Virgie.

73
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:27,600
Bye, Miss Virgie.

74
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:31,000
Take him right away, boss.
There you go. Come on! Come on!

75
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,400
- Good-bye, Mr. Cary.
- Good-bye.

76
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,600
Come on here,Jimmy.
Hold it.

77
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:49,800
Uncle Billy...

78
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:54,600
I don't think it was very polite
to chase everybody out of my party like that.

79
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,000
Their mammies have
to get 'em home quick.

80
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:00,000
You see, honey child,
there's going to be a war.

81
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,200
What's a war?

82
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,800
Well, a war is a lot
of soldiers and battles...

83
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,200
where men kill each other with guns.

84
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,400
Really and truly kill each other?

85
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,400
- Yes, ma'am.
- Why?

86
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,800
Seem like to me, honey,
no one knows why.

87
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,600
I hear a white gentleman say there's a man
up North who wants to free the slaves.

88
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:25,800
What does that mean,
"free the slaves''?

89
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:29,800
I don't know what it means myself.

90
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,800
It's funny, isn't it?

91
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,200
There's Daddy! It's Daddy!

92
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:12,400
My daddy's the best soldier
in the whole army.

93
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,800
Ready, halt!

94
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:49,400
Company, march!

95
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Oh,James Henry,
you always do it wrong.

96
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:01,400
I see the Yankees here last week.
When they say " march,'' they starts.

97
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,000
When they say " halt,'' they stops.

98
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:07,000
Well, that's just why I do it different.

99
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,800
I wouldn't do anything
those Yankees do!

100
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,000
Look! Here they come again,
Miss Virgie! Look!

101
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,200
- Come on!
- Come on, Miss Virgie! They might hurt you!

102
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,800
- Come on, Miss Virgie.
- I'm not going to run.

103
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,000
- They's liable to hurt you.
- I just won't budge.

104
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,400
- I'll show them I'm not afraid.
- I is!

105
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:35,000
- Ain't you a speck afraid, Miss Virgie?
- No, I'm not.

106
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:37,600
What are you afraid of them for?

107
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,800
Oh, honey child, them Yankees is mighty powerful.
They can even change the weather.

108
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
- Yes?
- Whenever they come around...

109
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,600
I never know whether
it's winter or summer.

110
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,600
I'm shiverin' and sweatin'
at the same time.

111
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:56,200
- Go and tell Mother they're coming.
- I think I better.

112
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:05,200
Troops, halt!

113
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:23,000
Good Lord, Miss Virgie!
You is startin' another war!

114
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,000
- Who did that?
- I did.

115
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:33,400
- Well, you're truthful anyway.
- My mommy and daddy
taught me never to tell a lie.

116
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,600
They're right. Who are you?

117
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,800
- I'm a Confederate.
- So you're a little rebel, eh?

118
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:44,000
I'm not a rebel. My daddy said so.
I'm a Confederate.

119
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:48,200
- Your daddy a soldier?
- He's the best soldier in the whole world.

120
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,400
- Is he around here now?
- I wouldn't tell you if he was.

121
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:55,400
Got a lot of spunk, haven't you?

122
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:59,800
- Well, I'm not afraid of you.
- Well, I'm glad you're not.

123
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:03,800
I think it'd be awful if a nice,
little girl like you were afraid of me.

124
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,600
Nevertheless, you better
mind your manners, young lady...

125
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,200
and don't use that slingshot again.

126
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,400
 I wish I was in Dixie
Hooray, hooray 

127
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,600
 In Dixieland I'll take my stand 

128
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,400
 To live and die in Dixie
Away, away 

129
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,400
 Away down South in Dixie
Away, away 

130
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,000
 Away down South in Dixie 

131
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:55,200
- Mommy?
- Yes, Virgie.

132
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,600
When is Daddy
coming to see us again?

133
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:04,200
Oh, we can't tell, darling. He's a long
distance away, and it's not so easy as it was.

134
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,000
- Why isn't it?
- Because we're in enemy territory now.

135
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
What does " enemy territory'' mean?

136
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:16,600
Well, it means that the Yankees have captured
this land, and it doesn't belong to us anymore.

137
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,800
And every time that Daddy comes to see us,
he has to cross through the enemy lines...

138
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
and that's very dangerous.

139
00:14:23,200 --> 00:14:25,600
I can't understand it.

140
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,000
I say my prayers every night...

141
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,400
and I say a special prayer
for Daddy to come and see us...

142
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,200
but it doesn't seem to do any good.

143
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,000
So yesterday I started
praying in the daytime too.

144
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:42,200
I prayed twice yesterday,
and I prayed three times today.

145
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,200
I'm sure it'll work now, Mommy.

146
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,800
Here comes Daddy!
It's Daddy!

147
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,400
- Massa Cary.
- Uncle Billy.

148
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:24,000
Tears?

149
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,200
Joy!

150
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,800
Me too, Daddy. Look.

151
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,400
Southerners never cry.

152
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,600
- Oh, what are these things then?
- Raindrops.

153
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,200
- On a sunshiny day? Aww!
- Ohh!

154
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,000
Can you stay long this time, Daddy?

155
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,600
Not this time either, darling.
I have to get right on.

156
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,000
I'll see if Rosabelle
has your lunch ready.

157
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:53,800
- Are they getting a fresh horse for me?
- Everybody knows just what to do.

158
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:57,200
- We practice it every day.
- Oh, God love you!

159
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,800
Miss Virgie,
I brought you some water and a towel.

160
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:22,400
- I thought maybe Massa Cary
would like to wash his face.
- Thank you,James Henry.

161
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,800
Didn't nobody tell me to do it either.
I thought of it all by myself.

162
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:30,600
Well, you must be thinking better
than you used to,James Henry.

163
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:34,000
Yes, sir, Massa Cary.
I even think more often now.

164
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,200
-James Henry!
- Yes, Miss Virgie?

165
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:38,800
Didn't I tell you
to bring this water?

166
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:44,200
That's right. It was you.
I thought it was Uncle Billy.

167
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,200
What was that I thunk up
all by myself?

168
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,400
Oh, yes. I was gonna polish
Massa Cary's boots.

169
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:54,800
Didn't nobody tell me to do that,
did they?

170
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,200
Never mind my boots,James Henry.
Go water my horse.

171
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,400
Yes, sir, Massa Cary.

172
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,800
Daddy?

173
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,400
Are we winning the war?

174
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,800
Well, things are going along.

175
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,400
- Will it last much longer?
- Mm, I hope not.

176
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:22,000
- Do you have to work hard in the war?
- We all have to do our share.

177
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,000
Every time I see you
you're always so tired.

178
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,400
Well, I'm not tired now.

179
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,600
You're giving me new strength.

180
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,000
I miss you, Daddy.
Do you miss me?

181
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:41,000
Indeed I do.

182
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,200
You know when I miss you the most?

183
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:46,600
At twilight when you used to sing to me.

184
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:50,000
Let's pretend it's twilight now, Daddy.

185
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:09,400
Now, you just close your eyes and make out
you're tired, and I'll sing to you now.

186
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Why, I was humming in my sleep.

187
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,600
Aw, you were not!

188
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,200
Tom's bringing up another horse.

189
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:24,200
- That's fine. Oh, Tom?
- Yes, sir, Massa Cary?

190
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:28,200
- Give him some water and fill
those saddlebags with oats.
- Yes, sir, Massa Cary.

191
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:32,400
I'll go to the stables for you, Daddy.
I can run faster.

192
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:36,200
I'd better get going while the coast is clear.
I've got to find out...

193
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,400
where Sheridan's army's camping
and report to General Lee before nightfall.

194
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,800
I'm so worried about you
on these scouting expeditions.

195
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:45,800
If they catch you,
you'll be shot as a spy.

196
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:49,200
As long as they don't find any dispatches on me,
and I'm not wearing a Yankee uniform...

197
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:53,000
- I'd only be arrested as a prisoner of war.
- As if that weren't bad enough.

198
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,200
- Please be careful.
- You know I will.

199
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,200
- I'll push. It'll make you go faster.
- Oh, go on now.

200
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,400
- Go on, hurry!
- Oh!

201
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,600
- How is she, Uncle Billy?
- Oh, fine, Massa Cary. Fine, sir.

202
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,400
We's only got two left,
but they both good, sir.

203
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,600
Two left?

204
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:17,200
Well, I've had to sell or trade
nearly all the stock for food-

205
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,600
that is, all that weren't stolen.

206
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:22,600
I've saved the horses till the last,
knowing you might need them.

207
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:26,800
- Why didn't you tell me?
- This is the part of the war
we women must fight, darling.

208
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,200
Push me!

209
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,600
I pushed the oats all the way
from the stables, Daddy.

210
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,400
It's a wonder this lazy jackass
didn't eat 'em up on the way.

211
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,000
Go on back to that stable, boy.

212
00:20:57,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Yankees, Massa Cary!
Yankees! They's comin'!

213
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,400
Go ahead, son. I got him.

214
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,800
Good-bye, darling.
Don't be afraid.

215
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:07,000
Please be careful.

216
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:12,400
- Good-bye, honey.
- Oh, Daddy.

217
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,000
Come on, darling.
Daddy has to hurry.

218
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:19,000
Let's see you smile.

219
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,400
Oh, that's only a half o' one.

220
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,400
Come on now.
Give Daddy a grand, big fat smile.

221
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Oh, that's fine.

222
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:33,400
Come on, Massa Cary.
Hurry, please, sir.

223
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,400
I'll try to cross the river the other side
of the old mill. I can hide in the woods.

224
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:44,200
I'll fire three quick shots
to let you know I'm safe.

225
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:47,200
Keep them here long as you can.
I'll need the time. Good-bye.

226
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,000
- God ride with you, darling.
- Oh, Daddy?

227
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,400
- Yes, dear?
- Give all my love to General Lee.

228
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,400
I will, honey.

229
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,600
Seth! Seth!
Where's them Yankees at?

230
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,800
They're just turning off
the main road.

231
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,200
- Get that corn from the barn into the house.
- Yes, sir.

232
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
Quick!

233
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,000
I can carry two, Rosabelle.

234
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
There you is, child.

235
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,800
Come on, children.
Come on. Hurry.

236
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,200
- Are they in sight yet?
- No, ma'am, Missa Cary.

237
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,200
- Here, you put this away. I'll watch.
- Yes, ma'am.

238
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,000
Come on. Come on, hurry.

239
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,000
Uncle Billy!

240
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,000
Here they come!
Here they come!

241
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,200
Rosabelle, get in the drawing room and start
sewing just like you surprised to see 'em.

242
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,400
- Yes, Uncle Billy.
- The rest of you, out in the stable, quick.

243
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:32,800
Uncle Billy, do you think the Yankees
will find us in the secret room?

244
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,600
Don't you be a-scared, child.
There ain't nothing to worry about.

245
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,400
- There is somethin' to worry about if you's white.
- What you mean?

246
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,000
They won't hurt us, 'cause we's slaves.
They's fightin' for us.

247
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,000
But if you's white and Southern,
then you's the enemy.

248
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,800
Oh, don't pay him no mind.
Go on, children. Get in there and hide.

249
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,000
All right, Uncle Billy.

250
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:56,400
Get in now. You too young to see
anything that may happen.

251
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,600
- What's the matter, Miss Virgie?
- My dress is caught.

252
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:05,000
For a man they ain't gonna hurt...

253
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:08,600
you do a powerful lot of shivering
every time the Yankees comes around.

254
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:12,200
My mind says they ain't gonna hurt me,
but my body don't believe it.

255
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,800
Aahh!

256
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,800
- Where's Missa Cary?
- I don't know. I ain't seen her.

257
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,400
- Stand up, you!
- Yes, sir. Yes, sir.

258
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,600
We're looking for a spy.
Is there a rebel hiding in this house?

259
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,200
No, sir. No, sir, Massa General.
Nobody at all, sir.

260
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,600
- Who lives here?
- Missa Cary, sir.

261
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,800
- Is she married?
- Yes, sir.

262
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,000
- Where's her husband?
- I-

263
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,200
- Is he a rebel?
- I-

264
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,600
- Is he a rebel?
- He's away in the war, sir.

265
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,200
In the Confederate Army?

266
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:57,000
- Yes, sir.
- Where is she?

267
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,400
She's around,
but I don't know where, sir.

268
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,800
Search the house, men.
She's hiding someone.

269
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:07,400
- If she wasn't, she'd be here.
- Yes, sir. Come on, men.

270
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:11,600
Barnes, Lorny, Robinson, upstairs.
The rest of you men take the lower floor.

271
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,200
- Start in back. Mason, deploy all your men.
- Yes, sir.

272
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,200
- Bring me a drink.
- We ain't got nothin', sir, 'cepting apple cider.

273
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:29,000
- Well, bring me that.
- Yes, sir, Massa General.

274
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,200
- You, get me something to eat.
- We ain't got-

275
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,000
- Get me something to eat!
- I'll try, sir.

276
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,400
Here's something, men.
Keep it covered.

277
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,000
Yes, sir, I was just on my way out.

278
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,200
What were you doing in that closet?

279
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,400
I-I went in there to get me some air.

280
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Oh, you go into a dark closet to get air,
do you?

281
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,800
Yes, sir. You see, I'm a man
who likes to change his air.

282
00:25:58,000 --> 00:26:00,200
I gets tired of regular old air.

283
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:03,600
So every little once in a while,
I go in someplace...

284
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,800
and get me some good closet air.

285
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,600
Come on, come on. Get out of here.

286
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,800
Search it, men.

287
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,600
- Nobody back there, sir.
- Any trapdoors in the floor?

288
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:17,200
- Couldn't find any, sir.
- Well, keep your eyes open.

289
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,200
- Yes, sir.
- Watch for secret panels.
These houses all have 'em.

290
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:33,400
- Why did you drop that pitcher?
- It just slipped off the tray, sir.

291
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,000
Slipped, eh? It slipped when I said
something about secret panels.

292
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,600
- That's when it slipped, didn't it?
- I didn't hear you say it, sir.

293
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,800
- Now listen, you-
- Sergeant!

294
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,000
- Sergeant!
- Find anything?

295
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,600
These oats out in front,
and the ground nearby was wet...

296
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,400
as though a horse had been watered
and the saddlebags filled.

297
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,400
These oats ain't been there 1 0 minutes.
The sun hasn't turned 'em yet.

298
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Search the stables and rush some
men down to the river near that old mill.

299
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,400
- That's where he'll cross ifhe gets away.
- Yes, sir.

300
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,200
Come on, boys.

301
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:09,000
Here, take this to the kitchen
and get the general some more cider.

302
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,200
- Sergeant.
- Find anything?

303
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,600
- Nothing up there.
- There's a trapdoor in the kitchen.

304
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:17,000
I'm gonna find out what's under it.

305
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,200
- Did you find anything?
- Let's look around-

306
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,800
What are you doing glued to that wall?
You've been lying. Now, come on.

307
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,600
I've got something!

308
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,200
Look at this.
There must be somebody in there.

309
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,400
- It's a secret panel.
- It ain't nothing, sir.

310
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,800
- Open it.
- It's just a wall, sir.

311
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:41,200
- Bust it in.
- Wait a minute. I'll open it.

312
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,200
It's just two little babies in there.
That's all.

313
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:51,200
Well, this ain't much
to get excited about.

314
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:56,000
Nothing to eat, eh? And no liquor?
Well, this is pretty good.

315
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:06,600
Hurry up.
Get out ofhere. Come on.

316
00:28:06,800 --> 00:28:10,600
Come on. Get out of here.
Hurry up.

317
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:13,800
Get one of those hams
and have it cooked.

318
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,400
- Yes, sir.
- You boys can get yourselves
a couple of drinks too.

319
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,800
Yes, sir!

320
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,600
Ah, right down the scuppers.

321
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
Come here, you.

322
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:48,200
Pull off these boots.

323
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:56,600
Why, you little black rascal!
I'll tan your hide for this!

324
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:01,600
- Come here, you little rascal!
- You let me go! You let me go!

325
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:05,600
White, by gad!

326
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,200
Who told you to put that black on?

327
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:13,200
I guess your daddy told you to do it.
Your daddy's a soldier, isn't he?

328
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:18,400
Why, I wouldn't hurt a little girl like you.
Maybe you'll tell me where your daddy is.

329
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:22,600
I'd like to talk to him.
Come here, you!

330
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:26,600
- She didn't mean nothing, master.
- Don't you dare touch that child!

331
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:30,000
- Turn me loose!
- Mother! Mother!

332
00:29:30,200 --> 00:29:32,400
- Run, Virgie, run!
- Let me go!

333
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,400
Mother! Mother!

334
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,800
I didn't mean to shove ya.

335
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
Don't you hurt my mother!
Don't you dare hurt my mother!

336
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,400
- You let her alone! Attention!

337
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,000
What's going on here?

338
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,200
Are you hurt, madam?

339
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,400
No.

340
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:06,400
- Who's in command here?
- I am, sir.

341
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,800
Do you know what he did?

342
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,600
He broke our table, and he wanted to hurt me,
and he threw my mommy down the stairs.

343
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:19,200
Put that loot back where you got it.

344
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,800
- Lieutenant Harte.
- Yes, sir.

345
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:26,400
Take him outside and give him 25 lashes.
Beat him till he bleeds.

346
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,600
Investigate the others. If you find any
of them guilty, give them five lashes each.

347
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,000
Yes, sir. Come on, Dudley.

348
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:39,800
I can't tell you
how sorry I am, madam.

349
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:42,400
And you too, miss.

350
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,200
- Why, you were crying, weren't you?
- Not very much.

351
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,200
You look like you've been
climbing up the chimney.

352
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,200
Your men were the cause of it.

353
00:30:56,400 --> 00:31:01,800
Just wait till I tell my Daddy about this.
He'll go and kill your whole Yankee army!

354
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,400
And I won't blame him a bit.
Blow.

355
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:07,200
Thank you.

356
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,400
Now you run along and play.

357
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,800
There's a rebel scout, madam,
known to be in this neighborhood.

358
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:20,400
I'm sorry to have to question you after
what's already occurred, but it's necessary.

359
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:25,200
- I know nothing of him.
- I happen to know that you do. He's your husband.

360
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,200
- Have you seen him today?
- No.

361
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:32,000
Would you tell me if you had?

362
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:34,400
Would you expect me to?

363
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:37,000
I'm afraid not.

364
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:42,200
- What is it, Sergeant?
- We found a horse in a corral
half a mile below here, sir.

365
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,200
Shows signs ofhaving been ridden hard
a short while ago.

366
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:48,000
He changed horses here.
Send five men to the river.

367
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:51,400
Put two sharpshooters on the roof
of that old mill so they can cover both banks.

368
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:55,400
Yes, sir.

369
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,600
What's that?

370
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,000
A godsend.

371
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:05,000
In that case, I'm afraid there's no longer
any necessity for my staying.

372
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,200
Good day, madam.

373
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,800
And good day to you,
you little rebel.

374
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,800
- Sergeant!
- Yes, sir?

375
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,200
Countermand that order.
He's already across.

376
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,800
- All right, we're going back to camp.
- Yes, sir.

377
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:57,800
Come in!

378
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:00,800
I don't think we should stay here
a second longer, Missa Cary.

379
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,800
The Yankees is already down by the east pasture,
and we's right in the line of fire.

380
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:09,800
You better hurry.
The shells is droppin' in the yard now.

381
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:12,000
Please, hurry.

382
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Don't be afraid.

383
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,600
- Uncle Billy, can't we get to the slaves' quarters?
- No, ma'am.

384
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:31,800
They's firin' there now.

385
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
Excuse me, Captain.

386
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,200
One of your slaves is outside.
Wants to see you. He says it's very important.

387
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,400
- What? One of my slaves?
- Yes, sir.

388
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:11,000
- How could he have gotten through
the Yankee lines? Send him in.
- Yes, sir.

389
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Oh, Massa Cary,
thanks the Lord I found you, sir.

390
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,600
- What is it, Uncle Billy?
- Missa Cary, she's awful sick, sir.

391
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,800
- Sick?
- Yes, sir. I's afraid, Massa Cary. I's afraid, sir.

392
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,800
She keeps asking for you all the time.

393
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,600
- What happened?
- Sir, they fought right in front of the house.

394
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,800
The house was burned down.

395
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,200
Missa Cary, she catch her death of cold.
She's coughing bad.

396
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,600
How long has this been going on?

397
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:42,000
She was sick for three weeks
and gettin' worse.

398
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,200
Then I decided I better fetch you.

399
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:48,200
I been going from camp to camp
looking for you for over a week now.

400
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:53,200
- Most of the slaves run away.
- And Virgie- How's little Virgie?

401
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,600
Oh, she's fine, sir.
Never complain about nothing and always cheerful.

402
00:34:57,800 --> 00:35:00,400
She's been a great comfort
to Missa Cary.

403
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,800
But I's afraid Missa Cary
needs you now, sir.

404
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,600
- I'll get a leave of absence right away.
- Yes, sir.

405
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,200
I've got some logs in the river
covered with brush.

406
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:13,200
We can float down past the Union camps, then cut
inland 'cross through the Chickahominy Swamp.

407
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,400
- Well, hurry. We'll have to get
into the swamp before daybreak.
- Yes, sir.

408
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,400
Here's the Union camp now, sir.

409
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:23,000
It's only an hour before daylight.

410
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:27,400
- Do you think we can do it, Massa Cary?
- Well, we can try. Come on.

411
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,600
You're feeling better now,
aren't you, Mommy?

412
00:36:57,600 --> 00:37:00,600
Yes, dear, much better.

413
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,400
I bet it won't be long
before Daddy is here.

414
00:37:03,400 --> 00:37:06,200
He'll make everything all right.
You'll see.

415
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:10,000
We-We mustn't be too sure, darling.

416
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:14,000
Then we won't be so disappointed
if he doesn't get here.

417
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:18,200
Perhaps Uncle Billy didn't
get through the Yankee lines.

418
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,000
Uncle Billy can do anything.

419
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,600
He can sing and dance
and climb trees...

420
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,000
and do everything in the world.

421
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:28,400
I know he can bring Daddy back.

422
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:33,400
Now, I have my housework to do...

423
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,400
so you just lie quiet until I finish.

424
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:39,200
Mother's very proud of you, darling.

425
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:44,600
I'll be right back.

426
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,000
Rosabelle, you're crying.

427
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,000
No, Miss Virgie, I ain't cryin', child.

428
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,400
My eyes just kinda slipped.

429
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,800
Well, my daddy will be here soon...

430
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,400
and then your eyes
won't have to slip.

431
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,800
Yes'm, Miss Virgie.

432
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,200
What are you doing there,
James Henry?

433
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,800
Well, I sleeps in that kitchen...

434
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,800
and I wants to hear them Yankees
when they's a-comin'...

435
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,000
so I dug this hole.

436
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,200
I's gonna cover it over,
so when they walks across it...

437
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:28,600
they'll fall in,
but they'll make a heap of noise.

438
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,400
And then I'll hear 'em,
and I'll start runnin'.

439
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,800
- I hope nobody else falls in it.
- Yes, ma'am.

440
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:40,800
Look!
Here comes Uncle Billy now!

441
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,800
But he didn't bring Daddy.

442
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,400
- Here comes Daddy!
- Massa Cary's comin'!

443
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:58,000
- Praise the Lord!
- Daddy! Daddy!

444
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,200
My darling.

445
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,200
Praise the Lord, Missa Cary.
He does come!

446
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,400
The whole Yankee army couldn't stop him.
He's done come.

447
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
Thank heaven.

448
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:27,600
I had to live till you got here
and I knew Virgie'd be safe.

449
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:31,400
Please don't talk like that, dear.

450
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:35,200
Didn't I tell you that Uncle Billy
would find him, Mommy?

451
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,600
Yes, dear.

452
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:40,000
I bet now that Daddy is here...

453
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,000
it won't be long before we have
a great big house again.

454
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,800
- Will it, Daddy?
- No, darling.

455
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:51,400
Oh, Daddy, I wish Mommy
didn't have to be sick.

456
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,800
Shh. You've got to be
a brave little girl, darling.

457
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,200
Well, can't I be brave
and wish Mommy wasn't sick too?

458
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,600
Of course, Virgie.

459
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,000
Mother isn't going to be sick
much longer now.

460
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:12,200
She's going to sleep, darling.

461
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:18,200
And if there are dreams
in that... sleep...

462
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:20,200
oh, my darlings...

463
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:24,200
how I'll dream of you.

464
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,400
Oh, Daddy,
I had a dream last night.

465
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,800
I dreamed Mommy and you
were putting me to bed.

466
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:35,800
And do you remember how you
used to tell me fairy tales?

467
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,200
- Come on, honey child.
- First Mother-

468
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:45,000
What is it, Uncle Billy?

469
00:40:53,800 --> 00:40:56,200
What's the matter, Uncle Billy?

470
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:58,600
Why does everybody act so funny?

471
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:01,000
Is something wrong?

472
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,800
No, honey child.

473
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,800
There is something wrong.
Is it about my mommy?

474
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:14,200
Daddy, what is it?

475
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,600
Did something happen to my mommy?

476
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,200
Something very beautiful, darling.

477
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:26,800
That's how you must
always think of it-

478
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:30,000
that Mama'll never be ill again...

479
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:33,400
or frightened or discouraged.

480
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,800
She'll never suffer anymore.

481
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,200
Just-Just think of it...

482
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
as beautiful.

483
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,400
- Daddy?
- Yes, honey.

484
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,000
You won't ever leave me, will you?

485
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
No, I'll never let you
out of my arms again.

486
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,600
- Uncle Billy.
- Yes, Massa Cary?

487
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,600
There hasn't been a Yankee patrol
through here since morning.

488
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,800
There's bound to be one soon.
Get Miss Virgie's things ready.

489
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:26,800
- You mean, you're gonna take
Miss Virgie with you, Massa Cary?
- Yes.

490
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,000
- Through the Yankee line?
- I've got to get her to my sister in Richmond.

491
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:33,600
- But, Captain, it's dangerous. You can't do it, sir.
- Yankees, Daddy!

492
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:39,600
All of you go back to your cabins,
but don't hurry.

493
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:43,200
Rosabelle, you go with them
and see that they don't talk.

494
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,000
- Uncle Billy, you wait outside and watch.
- Yes, sir.

495
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,400
- Come, honey.
- Don't talk now.

496
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:01,400
Well, I didn't know-
I didn't know that hole was there.

497
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:11,600
Honey, do you remember how Mama
always taught you never to tell a lie?

498
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:15,200
- Oh, I never have, Daddy.
- I know, and Mama's proud of you for it.

499
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:19,200
But if those Yankees should come in here,
you've got to tell them a lie.

500
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,600
- You want me to tell a lie?
-Just this once, honey, for Daddy's sake.

501
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:25,200
And in a case like this,
it really isn't a lie.

502
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,400
If they should stop here
and they ask you...

503
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:31,200
tell them I was here but I left an hour ago,
and you saw me cross the river.

504
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,800
Now be a brave little Confederate, darling.
Do this for me.

505
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:37,000
- Daddy.
- Hmm?

506
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,000
- Would General Lee want me to tell that lie?
- Yes, dear, this once.

507
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,800
All right, then
I'll tell a whopper.

508
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,000
They's comin', Massa Cary!

509
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,400
Here, help me with this.

510
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,200
Don't be frightened.
Act as though you didn't know they were here.

511
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:58,400
All right, Massa Cary.

512
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,200
Put that table back up
against the wall.

513
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:08,200
Remember now, act as though nothing
had occurred. Dance or play or something.

514
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,400
We will, Daddy.

515
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,000
- What you all doin'?
- You got your mouth organ?

516
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,800
- Yeah.
- Well, get ready to use it.

517
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,400
Sergeant, take your men
and search that wood.

518
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:36,600
Cary's around here, and this time we've got to
get him. He's given us the slip long enough.

519
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,800
- Hurry now. Move fast.
- Yes, sir.

520
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,000
All right, men, let's go.

521
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:42,800
Well, that was quite a concert.

522
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:48,200
And how is the littlest rebel of them all?

523
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,800
Fine, Yankee.Just fine.

524
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,800
Do you mind if I warm
my hands at your fire?

525
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,200
No, sir.

526
00:46:00,600 --> 00:46:03,000
- You two all alone here?
- Yes, sir.

527
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,000
Yes, sir. My daddy was here,
but he left an hour ago.

528
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,200
- Is that so?
- Yes, sir. He was here.. .

529
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,600
but he left an hour ago,
and I saw him cross the river.

530
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,000
Well, now, that's very interesting.

531
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:26,200
I know another dance.

532
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:29,000
Oh, yes, sir.
She know a lot of dances.

533
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:32,000
Now, dance for the gentlemen,
honey child.

534
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:37,400
What was your father doing here?

535
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:42,200
My mommy was very sick,
and she kept asking for Daddy.

536
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,800
So yesterday Uncle Billy brought him...

537
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,600
and this morning
my mommy went away.

538
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,200
- Is that true?
- Yes, sir.

539
00:46:57,600 --> 00:46:59,800
I'm sorry.

540
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,000
But my daddy says I must always
think of it as beautiful.

541
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:08,600
Your daddy's right. You see,
I have a little girl, too,just about your age...

542
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,800
and I'd feel awful sorry
if her mommy went away.

543
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,600
- Has your little girl got a pony?
- And a cart.

544
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:17,800
Does she get enough
to eat and everything?

545
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:31,800
You had the table out
in the center of the room, eh?

546
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,800
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

547
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,200
- What are those tracks?
- I made them with my foot.

548
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:39,800
Is that a trapdoor
in the ceiling there?

549
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,800
No, sir. There ain't nothing up there.
Nothing at all, sir.

550
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:47,400
- You've been lying to me.
- No, sir, I haven't.

551
00:47:47,600 --> 00:47:49,600
- Your father's here now!
- No, sir, he isn't!

552
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,000
- You know he is!
- He was here, but he left an hour ago.

553
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:57,000
- I saw him cross the river.
- You tell me the truth, or I'll give you the worst-

554
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,400
-Just a minute!
- Drop your pistol.

555
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:07,800
Now, come down
and keep your hands up.

556
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:14,800
Back over against that door.

557
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:19,600
Turn around and keep those hands up.

558
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,600
Daddy.

559
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,600
All right, you can drop them now,
but no funny business.

560
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,400
Oh, Daddy, I didn't do it right, did I?

561
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,600
Yes, you did, darling.
Daddy's proud of you.

562
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:33,000
I said just what you told me to.

563
00:48:33,200 --> 00:48:37,000
You were perfect,
and I was only fooling about the whipping.

564
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:39,000
I really wasn't going to.

565
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,600
Run outside, darling.
Daddy'll call you.

566
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:43,600
Come on, Uncle Billy.

567
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,400
Can you arrange so that
my arrest won't frighten her?

568
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,000
- I'll try.
- Thanks.

569
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,600
- Any papers on you?
- No, I'm not scouting this trip, Colonel.

570
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:01,600
I came home to bury my dead...

571
00:49:01,800 --> 00:49:04,400
and take my little girl to
Richmond, where my sister is.

572
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:06,600
I see.

573
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:09,000
Well, come on.
Let's get it over with.

574
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:13,200
I'm afraid I won't be able to-
to bid my little girl good-bye.

575
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,200
I understand.

576
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:18,600
Will you tell her
I've gone back to General Lee?

577
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,600
I'll return soon.

578
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:30,800
- Yes, it would just about fit.
- What?

579
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,400
- The Yankee uniform.
- What do you mean?

580
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:37,600
- You know the Cartwright plantation?
- Well.

581
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:40,800
I left a uniform there
to be mended by the slaves.

582
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,200
If you stole that uniform,
I don't know how I could stop you.

583
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:47,800
- You mean-
- If you were wearing a Union uniform...

584
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
and had a pass through the lines...

585
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:53,600
you'd stand a mighty good chance
of making Richmond.

586
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:57,600
- Where would I get a pass?
- From me.

587
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,800
I don't think my country expects me
to make war on babies.

588
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,400
I don't know what to say.

589
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:21,800
Of course, you realize what it means
if you're caught in my uniform.

590
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,600
Aren't you taking an awful
chance yourself, Colonel?

591
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,600
War's full of chances.

592
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:28,800
I won't forget this.

593
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,200
I hope you get through.

594
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,000
- God bless you.
- There's just one thing I ask.

595
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,400
In passing through our lines,
whatever you see or hear, forget.

596
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,400
My word of honor.

597
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:43,000
Daddy, Daddy!
The soldiers are coming back!

598
00:50:43,000 --> 00:50:45,800
Get out the back way.
Follow the woods to the Cartwrights'.

599
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,000
Daddy, is the Yankee man
gonna be nice?

600
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,200
A man couldn't be nicer
than he's been.

601
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,400
You see, you've made me
think of my little girl.

602
00:50:52,600 --> 00:50:56,400
- I knew all the time you weren't gonna whip me.
- Come on. We've got to hurry.

603
00:50:56,600 --> 00:50:58,600
Good luck.

604
00:51:00,400 --> 00:51:03,200
You're nice enough
to be a Confederate.

605
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:05,400
Good-bye, Uncle Billy.

606
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:10,800
- Any sign of him?
- Not a thing, Colonel.

607
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,000
Well, you men better come in and warm up.
There's a fire in here.

608
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:16,600
Yes, sir.

609
00:51:24,000 --> 00:51:26,200
- No trace at all, eh?
- No.

610
00:51:26,400 --> 00:51:29,800
But I'm sure he's still around here.
They buried his wife just an hour ago.

611
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:32,000
Look! There goes somebody.

612
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:34,800
- A man and a child?
- Yes. They're headed for the woods.

613
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:39,200
That's a slave and his pickaninny.
They just left here. They're all right.

614
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,800
- Do you hear anything?
- Horses. Listen.

615
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,200
We've got to go back.

616
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,000
Didn't the man give you
a paper to show them, Daddy?

617
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:26,000
Yes, but the Yanks around here
may recognize me.

618
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:29,200
I don't want to use the pass
until we get out of this neighborhood.

619
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:31,400
This isn't a good neighborhood anyway.

620
00:52:31,600 --> 00:52:33,600
No. Come on.

621
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:44,000
- Halt!
- Whoa!

622
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:51,800
- Where are you going, sir?
- I'm taking this child to her
father just beyond our lines.

623
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:54,800
Colonel Morrison sent me.
Here's a pass.

624
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:57,400
Have you got a little girl, mister?

625
00:52:57,400 --> 00:52:59,400
No, I've got a boy.

626
00:52:59,400 --> 00:53:03,000
- Where'd you come from?
- Cary's plantation. Left there at noon.

627
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:06,600
- Why aren't you using the main road?
- Full of artillery.

628
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,600
How old is your little boy?

629
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:10,800
- Five.
- Oh, I'm six.

630
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:13,400
- My boy's bigger than you.
- He is?

631
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:16,800
Yes. This looks all right,
but I don't know.

632
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:20,400
We've got special orders to be on the watch
for Captain Cary, a rebel scout.

633
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,200
Didn't you hear?
They caught him this morning.

634
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:26,400
- They did?
- Yeah, Morrison's men, at his own plantation.

635
00:53:26,400 --> 00:53:29,400
- What's your regiment?
- 72nd Vermont.

636
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,400
It's all right then. You'll find them camped
just a mile below here. Go ahead.

637
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:35,400
Thanks.

638
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,400
Oh, Daddy, you told a fib.

639
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,200
Well, this is war, honey.

640
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,200
Why isn't it a sin to tell a fib in war?

641
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,200
I don't know why it isn't a sin
to do any of the things we do in war.

642
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:53,400
What's the 72nd Vermont?

643
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:57,000
Well, that's a regiment of soldiers
I have no intention of meeting.

644
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:01,400
Halt!

645
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:07,200
Colonel Morrison asked me to
take this child to Greensburg.

646
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:09,600
- Here's his pass.
- Colonel Morrison?

647
00:54:09,600 --> 00:54:11,200
- Yes.
- Where was he?

648
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,600
Cary plantation,
about 1 8 miles south ofhere.

649
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:15,800
- When did you leave there?
- Why-

650
00:54:15,800 --> 00:54:19,600
- We left there at 1 2:00.
- Why, you know all the answers too, huh?

651
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:22,600
Yes, sir. I'm six years old.

652
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,200
Well, I guess you're all right.
Go ahead.

653
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:30,200
Wait a minute!
I wanna see that kid!

654
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:35,400
- Whose child is this?
- Friend of Colonel Morrison's.

655
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:40,000
- Ever see me before?
- No.

656
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,600
Ya didn't, eh?
Don't you remember the shoe polish?

657
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,200
- No!
- Well, I do.

658
00:54:46,200 --> 00:54:49,000
Her old man's the most dangerous
scout in the rebel army.

659
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,000
This looks mighty funny to me.

660
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,600
Go get 'em! Hurry up!

661
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,000
Head 'em off!
Take the lower road!

662
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,600
Get under the seat quick, honey.

663
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,600
Halt!

664
00:55:47,800 --> 00:55:50,000
Keep your hands up.
Are you armed?

665
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,200
- No.
- Let's see.

666
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:56,800
All right, we'll go back.

667
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,800
Follow us.

668
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,600
- Captain?
- Yes.

669
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:18,000
- I'm afraid I've got to give you some bad news.
- The appeal was denied, huh?

670
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,600
Every finding of the court-martial
was upheld.

671
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,800
- That means-
- Yes.

672
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:27,200
When does the... party take place?

673
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:31,400
The morning of the 27 th... at dawn.

674
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:34,200
Well, I still have six days.

675
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:38,800
Any messages you want sent?
I'll be glad to do anything I can, Captain.

676
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:41,000
You've been very kind...

677
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,400
especially so in getting Uncle Billy here
to look after my little girl.

678
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,800
- I appreciate that.
- I wish there was something
I could really do, Captain.

679
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:50,800
That child has literally captured us all.

680
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,400
- Colonel-
- Yes, I know.

681
00:56:56,600 --> 00:56:59,400
I heard you.
No chance at all, eh?

682
00:56:59,400 --> 00:57:01,200
No.

683
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,800
And is my little party set
for the morning of the 27 th too?

684
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:06,800
I'm sorry, Colonel.

685
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:10,000
He's innocent, Major.
All he did was try to help a child.

686
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,400
The evidence we couldn't overcome,
Colonel...

687
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:16,600
was the fact that you not only gave him a pass
but that he was wearing your uniform.

688
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:20,200
- I stole that uniform.
- We couldn't make them believe that.

689
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,400
I had hoped we could.

690
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,400
I'll be about, Colonel,
if there's anything you want done.

691
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:28,200
Thank you, Major.

692
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,200
Well, it was a gamble, and we lost.

693
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:33,600
I have no regrets.

694
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,800
When I think of my own little baby,
I'd do the same thing over again.

695
00:57:48,600 --> 00:57:51,000
Why is a shoe called a shoe?

696
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:53,200
What?

697
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:56,200
I says, why is a shoe called a shoe?

698
00:57:56,200 --> 00:57:59,400
What do you mean, why
is a shoe called a shoe?

699
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,800
Well, the world is full of names.

700
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,600
They could have picked out
any other name.

701
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:07,000
- Who could?
- Whoever did.

702
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,800
- I don't know who it was.
- Man, what are you talkin' about?

703
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,400
Why is a shoe called a shoe?

704
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:19,200
Massa Cary says that shows you got brains
when you're thinkin' 'bout things.

705
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:25,200
I spent all day yesterday thinkin',
why is a horse called a horse?

706
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:27,800
Aw, shut your mouth, will you?

707
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:31,000
What time is it now, Uncle Billy?

708
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,800
I heard the town clock strike 3:00
a while back, Miss Virgie.

709
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:39,600
Oh, we'll have to hurry.
Daddy always expects me at 3:30.

710
00:58:39,600 --> 00:58:42,400
He says it makes
his afternoon seem shorter.

711
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:45,400
There. That's done.

712
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:48,400
Shall I brush your clothes now,
honey child?

713
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,400
Yes, please.

714
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,600
Do you think they'll keep Daddy
locked up in that place long, Uncle Billy?

715
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,800
No, ma'am.
I'm afraid they won't, honey.

716
00:58:57,000 --> 00:58:59,400
You're afraid?
You don't want my daddy-

717
00:58:59,400 --> 00:59:03,600
Oh, no, no, child.
I expects they take him out pretty soon now.

718
00:59:03,800 --> 00:59:06,600
Last night when I said my prayers...

719
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,600
I asked God
to let Daddy out of there...

720
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,800
and- and I asked him
for a new dress too.

721
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:16,600
Then I thought maybe
that was too much to ask...

722
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:20,000
so I told God he didn't have
to bother about the dress.

723
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:23,600
- Was that right, Uncle Billy?
- Yes, that was right, honey.

724
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,000
But if you want that dress...

725
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:29,600
I'll kinda slip a little
hint in my prayers tonight.

726
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,200
Now, Uncle Billy, if you
look sad when we get there...

727
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:36,600
like you did yesterday,
I'll never take you again.

728
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,000
No, ma'am, I won't.

729
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,800
We've got to smile,
so Daddy will think we're happy.

730
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,800
I will, honey. You'll see.
You ready now?

731
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:48,000
Yes, all ready.

732
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:51,800
James Henry, you wait here
until we get back.

733
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:54,000
Yes, sir.

734
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:08,400
Did you like it, Daddy?

735
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,400
You have charge of Captain Cary's little girl,
haven't you?

736
01:01:11,400 --> 01:01:13,600
Yes, sir.
I is one of his slaves, sir.

737
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,400
- I want to speak to you a moment.
- Yes, sir.

738
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:20,400
That was lovely, darling.
Come on now, and tell me what you've been doing.

739
01:01:20,600 --> 01:01:22,800
Oh, I sewed up a hole in my dress.

740
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:25,600
Mrs. Robin let me sweep the stoop.

741
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:29,200
- Why, you're becoming a regular, little housewife.
- Daddy?

742
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:31,600
- Hmm?
- When are they gonna let you out?

743
01:01:31,600 --> 01:01:34,000
No, no. Come on now.
Tell me what you've been doing.

744
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:37,200
Well, there's a little girl
lives across the street...

745
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:40,400
and she has a pony,
and she let me ride on it.

746
01:01:40,400 --> 01:01:44,400
- That's grand.
- And she gave me some candy, and she's a Yank.

747
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:48,200
And she said she didn't care
whether I was a rebel or not...

748
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:51,000
and I said I didn't care
whether she was a Yank.

749
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:54,800
Even if there is a war,
she was awfully nice to me.

750
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:57,000
- Daddy?
- Yes.

751
01:01:57,000 --> 01:02:01,200
When she was so nice,
and Colonel Morrison's so nice, and Mrs. Robin...

752
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:04,400
why do the rest of the people
have to kill each other?

753
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,600
I don't know, honey.

754
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:10,600
We grown-ups haven't as much
sense as you children.

755
01:02:10,600 --> 01:02:14,000
This isn't money enough,
but it's all I can spare.

756
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:17,000
I'll give you a letter to him.
He may help you. I don't know.

757
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,200
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

758
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,800
You've got four days to try it in.
It's worth taking the chance.

759
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:27,000
God bless you.
I'll start right now, sir.

760
01:02:27,200 --> 01:02:29,000
- Daddy?
- Yes, dear.

761
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:34,000
- I don't want to leave.
- Perhaps you'd better.
Tomorrow you can come again.

762
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,600
You're not leaving without
saying good-bye to me, are you?

763
01:02:40,000 --> 01:02:42,800
Oh, no.
I was gonna kiss you good-bye.

764
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:46,600
Then tomorrow when I come,
I'll do all the talking with you.

765
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:48,600
Oh, you switch around, eh?

766
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:53,000
Well, Daddy said you tried to help us,
so I make you my second daddy.

767
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,400
Nothing so nice ever happened to me.

768
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:57,200
We gotta hurry, missy.

769
01:02:58,800 --> 01:03:00,600
Good-bye, Yankee.

770
01:03:02,000 --> 01:03:04,000
Good-bye, rebel darling.

771
01:03:06,400 --> 01:03:08,200
Good-bye, Daddy.

772
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,400
- God love you, honey.
- I'll come tomorrow.

773
01:03:11,600 --> 01:03:13,600
- All right, sweetheart.
- Good-bye, Massa Cary.

774
01:03:13,800 --> 01:03:15,800
- Good-bye, Billy.
- Good-bye, Colonel Morrison, sir.

775
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:18,800
- Bye.
- Good-bye, darling.

776
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,600
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

777
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:26,400
Uncle Billy, isn't there any way
we can get them out of there?

778
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:29,000
Honey, that soldier man
give me some money.

779
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:32,400
He's gonna write me a letter
to give to a judge up in Washington.

780
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,000
He said there's just one way...

781
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:38,000
but I don't know if we got
enough money to get there.

782
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:44,200
Please, sir, how much is the railroad fare
for a colored man to Washington?

783
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:46,400
Six dollars and 20 cents.

784
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:48,600
And how much for the little girl, sir?

785
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:51,200
Ah, she's a little too tall for half fare.

786
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:54,600
Oh, no, I'm not.
I'm standing on my toes.

787
01:03:54,600 --> 01:03:57,800
This is my right size.

788
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:02,800
All right.
It'll be $9.60 for you, first class.

789
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:05,000
Thank you, sir.

790
01:04:09,200 --> 01:04:11,800
- Have you got enough?
- No, child.

791
01:04:11,800 --> 01:04:14,400
It's gonna take more money
than what we got.

792
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,400
How do people get money?

793
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,800
I know how to get some more money.
Come on, honey child.

794
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:05,000
Help the cause, white folks.
It's for the cause.

795
01:06:05,200 --> 01:06:08,200
- Which cause?
- The-The right cause.

796
01:06:08,400 --> 01:06:11,200
Thank you. Thank you.

797
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,200
I don't put no money
in the Confederate cap.

798
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,800
There you are, boss.
I brung this along just in case.

799
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:21,000
- Oh, well, that's-
- Thank you.

800
01:06:21,000 --> 01:06:23,200
Here, give me that.

801
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:28,000
This makes 44, 45, 46, 56.
Bless the Lord. Praise the Lord.

802
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,000
We got enough now,
honey, for railroad fare.

803
01:06:31,000 --> 01:06:33,000
Come on, child.

804
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:52,800
- You may go in now.
- Thank you, sir.

805
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,800
Come on, Uncle Billy.

806
01:07:04,000 --> 01:07:06,800
Come right in.

807
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:21,800
Miss Virginia Cary and Uncle Billy?

808
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:25,200
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir, Mr. President.

809
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:28,400
How do you do, my dear?

810
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:30,600
Very nicely. Thank you, sir.

811
01:07:30,600 --> 01:07:33,400
And how are you, Uncle Billy?

812
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:42,600
Let me see.

813
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,600
Judge Van Allen
told me about this case.

814
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:49,800
Yes, sir. He's the gentleman
the soldier man sent me to.

815
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,000
Come over here.
Tell me all about it.

816
01:07:55,600 --> 01:08:00,200
There. Now... that's nicer.

817
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:04,000
My daddy and Colonel Morrison
are in prison...

818
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:07,200
and they're going to shoot them.

819
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,400
Your father is a captain
in the Confederate Army.

820
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:14,600
Yes, sir.

821
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:16,800
Arrested as a spy.

822
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:19,200
My daddy isn't a spy!

823
01:08:19,400 --> 01:08:21,400
Do you know what a spy is?

824
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:25,000
I know it's something bad,
because they shoot you for it...

825
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:28,000
and my daddy
couldn't do anything bad.

826
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,800
I don't see how he could either...

827
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,800
with a little one like you.

828
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:37,000
Thank you kindly, sir.

829
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,600
Tell me about it.

830
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,400
My daddy went away to the war...

831
01:08:44,400 --> 01:08:47,200
and then the Yankees
came around to our house...

832
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:49,600
and sometimes
my daddy came home.

833
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:52,800
- Was he in uniform?
- Yes, sir.

834
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,200
- What color?
- Gray.

835
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:57,200
I see.

836
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:01,000
Thank you, sir.

837
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:03,800
Then there were
so many Yankees around...

838
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:06,400
my daddy couldn't
come home anymore.

839
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,600
Then they burnt down our house,
and my mommy got sick...

840
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:12,400
and had to go to bed
in Uncle Billy's cabin.

841
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,200
No, that's yours.
I had the last piece.

842
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,400
That's right.

843
01:09:19,400 --> 01:09:22,400
We had nothing to get her medicine with,
Mr. President.

844
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:25,000
The soldiers took
most everything we had.

845
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:28,200
And Mommy kept asking
for my daddy.

846
01:09:28,400 --> 01:09:30,600
All the time she'd ask.

847
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,200
No, that's mine.
You had the last piece.

848
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:39,800
- I beg your pardon.
- You forgot. That's all.

849
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:45,600
So Uncle Billy went
and brought my daddy back home.

850
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:50,400
The next day, my mommy went away.

851
01:09:52,200 --> 01:09:55,400
There, there. Don't cry.

852
01:09:55,400 --> 01:10:00,800
You're a great big girl.
You mustn't cry.

853
01:10:01,000 --> 01:10:04,600
- I won't.
- What happened next?

854
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:13,200
Then the Yankees came,
and my daddy had to hide in the garret.

855
01:10:13,400 --> 01:10:17,200
Then Colonel Morrison came in.
He talked to me.

856
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:21,800
He's awfully nice.
He has a little girl, too,just my age.

857
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:26,000
Then he found Daddy,
and Daddy told him...

858
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:30,200
about wanting to take me to my
Aunt Caroline in Richmond...

859
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:32,200
so I could get enough to eat.

860
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,400
That's why the colonel give
Massa Cary the pass, sir-

861
01:10:35,600 --> 01:10:39,600
just so he could bring Miss Virgie
where she could be taken care of.

862
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:43,200
I see. Now, on this trip...

863
01:10:43,400 --> 01:10:45,800
before your daddy was captured...

864
01:10:45,800 --> 01:10:48,600
did he write down anything
on paper or anything?

865
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:51,800
- No, sir.
- Did he ever stop and look at the Yankee soldiers...

866
01:10:51,800 --> 01:10:54,800
or count them
or look at the cannons?

867
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:58,800
No, sir. He told me
that if we got to Richmond...

868
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:01,400
and anyone asked me
what I had seen...

869
01:11:01,600 --> 01:11:03,800
I was in honor bound
not to tell them.

870
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,800
- He told you that?
- Yes, sir.

871
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:09,000
Because Colonel Morrison
asked him not to see anything...

872
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,800
and my daddy gave his word,
and they shook hands.

873
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:19,200
- John.
- Yes, Mr. President?

874
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:23,600
- Mr. President?
- Yes, Miss Virgie.

875
01:11:23,800 --> 01:11:27,600
You won't let them shoot my daddy
and Colonel Morrison, will you?

876
01:11:32,200 --> 01:11:36,200
- Rush this by special courier to General Grant.
- Yes, Mr. President.

877
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:46,200
- Is this yours?
- No, it's yours.

878
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:48,800
I had the last piece.

879
01:11:56,200 --> 01:12:00,800
There, there now.
All your terrible fears are over.

880
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:04,200
Your father and Colonel Morrison
are going free.
