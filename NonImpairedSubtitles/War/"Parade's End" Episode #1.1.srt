00:12:45,838 --> 00:12:50,517
- Yes, and you've weighted the calculations as though...
- As though people became ill

159
00:12:50,518 --> 00:12:52,797
according to what they have
to pay for medical treatment!

160
00:12:52,798 --> 00:12:57,757
They do, it will ruin the Exchequer,
and I intend Sir Reginald to know it.

161
00:12:57,758 --> 00:13:02,877
Suppose you could bolt with a new man
every week and no questions asked.

162
00:13:02,878 --> 00:13:07,077
- Ripping! Can I have this?
- No.

163
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:11,877
But the question is,
how long would it stay ripping

164
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:14,515
before you're simply yawning
to get back to your husband?

165
00:13:14,526 --> 00:13:17,356
- How long?
- It's not a riddle, Sylvia.

166
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,869
- I'm asking.
- Mmm.

167
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:24,797
Well...
It would have to be weekends only.

168
00:13:24,798 --> 00:13:29,757
One would still need a home,
a husband for show midweek,

169
00:13:29,758 --> 00:13:33,637
and a place to store one's maid.
I couldn't do without Hullo Central.

170
00:13:33,638 --> 00:13:35,398
(KNOCKING)

171
00:13:37,478 --> 00:13:41,197
Mrs Tietjens is not at home.

172
00:13:41,198 --> 00:13:42,437
Oh, but she...

173
00:13:42,438 --> 00:13:47,117
- Sylvia, you are such a rotter.
- Well, I'm not dressed for a picnic.

174
00:13:47,118 --> 00:13:51,037
Anyway, I've realised there's no point in a fling
if one's husband doesn't notice.

175
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:56,317
- I'd go!
- It's no use, Potty loves me!

176
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:59,438
He wants me to leave Christopher
and go abroad with him.

177
00:14:01,518 --> 00:14:03,597
Oh, I'd like to shake him!

178
00:14:03,598 --> 00:14:08,757
- Who?
- My husband, of course.

179
00:14:08,758 --> 00:14:11,398
Shake some reaction
out of that great lump!

180
00:14:15,518 --> 00:14:17,877
Do you happen to have a cigarette?

181
00:14:17,878 --> 00:14:19,158
Yes, of course.

182
00:14:22,558 --> 00:14:24,518
Thank you.

183
00:14:40,038 --> 00:14:42,957
Now look here,
don't be obtuse, Tietjens.

184
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,117
Dammit, man, is the department's duty
to support Waterhouse

185
00:14:46,118 --> 00:14:48,397
and make his case to the house.
Do you understand?

186
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:51,061
Minister has to show the figures
for the insurance bill will balance.

187
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:54,847
Well, they won't. And I should have thought
it was this department's duty to tell him so.

188
00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:58,717
Tietjens, you're the cleverest young
man in London, Macmaster says,

189
00:14:58,718 --> 00:15:01,277
and I'm inclined to believe him.

190
00:15:01,278 --> 00:15:04,557
But he and I,
with our blunt instruments,

191
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:07,717
have managed to grasp
something that you cannot.

192
00:15:07,718 --> 00:15:10,197
- Why thank you, Sir Reginald.
- Which is...

193
00:15:10,198 --> 00:15:13,117
that if they don't get what they
require from you, they'll put some

194
00:15:13,118 --> 00:15:16,998
competition-wallah head clerk on it
and take our credit from us.

195
00:15:19,758 --> 00:15:22,997
I simply wish you to be
aware of the fact...

196
00:15:22,998 --> 00:15:26,957
there's no difficulty in adjusting
the calculations to produce

197
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,957
a more congenial result.

198
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:32,282
I can let Macmaster have it
in the hour and 10 minutes remaining

199
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:35,718
but I insist on his taking
credit for it.

200
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:38,478
Good man.

201
00:15:39,758 --> 00:15:41,477
Votes for women!

202
00:15:41,478 --> 00:15:43,237
It's him, it's Waterhouse!

203
00:15:43,238 --> 00:15:45,518
(WOMEN SHOUT)

204
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:52,197
What the devil is going on here?

205
00:15:52,198 --> 00:15:53,917
- Keep moving, sir.
- Excuse me.

206
00:15:53,918 --> 00:15:55,957
This way, please.

207
00:15:55,958 --> 00:15:58,397
We came through without a scratch.
Thanks, Bertram.

208
00:15:58,398 --> 00:16:01,718
My fault for inviting a liberal.
Christmas spirit, you know?

209
00:16:03,278 --> 00:16:04,758
Will you be going on to Diana's?

210
00:16:06,398 --> 00:16:08,478
- Merry Christmas, Victoria.
- Merry Christmas...

211
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:19,758
- Christopher! There you are at last.
- Yeah, sorry.

212
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:25,660
- You look lovely.
- You look like thunder.

213
00:16:28,758 --> 00:16:32,598
You didn't mind that
I let Potty bring me ahead.

214
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:36,237
No, of course not.

215
00:16:36,238 --> 00:16:39,197
- Will you dance?
- I would if that were dancing.

216
00:16:39,198 --> 00:16:41,918
Will you save me one
when there's a tune?

217
00:16:58,238 --> 00:17:01,997
- You're a writer?
- Ah, yes, a little of the critic.

218
00:17:01,998 --> 00:17:04,718
- My book on Rosetti will be appearing...
- Macmaster.

219
00:17:06,198 --> 00:17:09,197
- How rude!
- That fellow over there with Sandbach.

220
00:17:09,198 --> 00:17:12,437
He's the Right Honourable
Stephen Waterhouse.

221
00:17:12,438 --> 00:17:15,917
He's the swine that made us
fake that schedule at the office.

222
00:17:15,918 --> 00:17:18,877
- I'm going to have a word with him.
- For God's sake, Chrissie!

223
00:17:18,878 --> 00:17:22,397
Those suffragettes, I would have
whipped till they bled.

224
00:17:22,398 --> 00:17:24,877
Spank them, that's what I say.

225
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:25,837
What have we come to

226
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:28,997
when a government minister can't go
anywhere without a policeman?

227
00:17:28,998 --> 00:17:32,237
Perhaps if the Prime Minister
had kept his promise to address

228
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:34,757
the women's concerns after
the summer recess...

229
00:17:34,758 --> 00:17:39,157
- Christian, my dear fellow...
- The women would keep their promise to stop protesting,

230
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:42,437
- while the police had their hands full with the coronation.
- Give the PM a chit.

231
00:17:42,438 --> 00:17:46,317
Quite right. Tietjens, hark to my
brother-in-law, the general.

232
00:17:46,318 --> 00:17:50,717
Tietjens. Oh, you must be the genius.
Allow me to thank you.

233
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:54,117
We couldn't have got the insurance
bill before the house

234
00:17:54,118 --> 00:17:56,957
till the next session
without your figures.

235
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:58,997
You're taking the credit
from Macmaster.

236
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:02,187
Oh, no, we know who to thank.
Sir Reginald let it out.

237
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,757
Macmaster?
He the fellow you brought with you?

238
00:18:06,758 --> 00:18:08,678
Who are his people?

239
00:18:11,718 --> 00:18:13,838
His father was a shipping
clerk in Edinburgh.

240
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:17,678
Well!

241
00:18:18,758 --> 00:18:23,638
- Was he angry with me?
- Angry with his wife, I expect. We got the brunt.

242
00:18:25,678 --> 00:18:29,317
- No! No, Potty.
- Yes.

243
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,397
Don't call me Potty.

244
00:18:31,398 --> 00:18:33,558
But it suits you.

245
00:18:36,838 --> 00:18:39,717
Will you come away with me?

246
00:18:39,718 --> 00:18:43,558
Well, I might... one day.

247
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:17,037
Sylvia has gone off
with that fellow...

248
00:19:17,038 --> 00:19:19,038
Perowne.

249
00:19:20,478 --> 00:19:23,677
I'm letting Lowndes Street,
and warehousing the furniture.

250
00:19:23,678 --> 00:19:25,517
I'm taking Michael
to my sister, Effie,

251
00:19:25,518 --> 00:19:27,997
she's married to a vicar who has
one of our livings.

252
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:29,918
Marchant will go with him.

253
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:35,038
- So you'll be wanting your old rooms?
- Mm-hm.

254
00:20:19,918 --> 00:20:22,197
One...

255
00:20:22,198 --> 00:20:24,157
two...

256
00:20:24,158 --> 00:20:25,696
Three...

257
00:20:25,719 --> 00:20:27,678
Your aunt Effie.

258
00:20:28,838 --> 00:20:30,838
Five... six...

259
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:34,401
Walk on.

260
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:46,040
Trott on.

261
00:21:01,888 --> 00:21:05,968
Poor child, living like
an orphan with his aunt Effie.

262
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:11,918
Bear up, old girl. You'll
be near at hand now for Michael.

263
00:21:13,263 --> 00:21:15,238
Your wife has shamed you both.

264
00:21:16,558 --> 00:21:17,838
All of us.

265
00:21:28,196 --> 00:21:29,499
You'll divorce?

266
00:21:29,523 --> 00:21:32,878
No, only a blagger
would submit his wife to that.

267
00:21:34,318 --> 00:21:37,317
Mrs Satterthwaite established
herself at a German spa,

268
00:21:37,318 --> 00:21:41,078
so that it may be said that Sylvia
has gone abroad to nurse her.

269
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:44,598
The mother's a bitch
but a sensible one.

270
00:21:49,198 --> 00:21:52,318
The motor-plough didn't serve.

271
00:21:55,069 --> 00:21:56,989
It's all coming.

272
00:22:21,262 --> 00:22:25,997
He's someone called Thurston,
I met him somewhere. He won't gossip.

273
00:22:25,998 --> 00:22:28,437
I don't care if he does.

274
00:22:28,438 --> 00:22:33,797
- Well, thank you very much.
- What does it matter? Now or later.

275
00:22:33,798 --> 00:22:35,918
We're not going to hide for ever.

276
00:22:38,758 --> 00:22:41,278
- Well, that's the thing, Potty.
- What thing?

277
00:22:44,637 --> 00:22:46,878
It's not for ever.

278
00:22:48,136 --> 00:22:49,933
Yes, it is.

279
00:22:49,944 --> 00:22:53,038
- I hope you're not going to behave badly.
- About what?

280
00:22:54,666 --> 00:22:57,566
About my going back,
before it's too late.

281
00:22:57,589 --> 00:23:02,075
Oh, no, you're not.
What are you talking about?

282
00:23:02,099 --> 00:23:05,117
- I miss my husband.
- No, you don't!

283
00:23:05,118 --> 00:23:09,674
- You call him... a great lump of wood.
- Oh, he is.

284
00:23:09,686 --> 00:23:13,396
I often want to kill him just to see
if there's any blood in him.

285
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,997
I'm permanently angry with him.

286
00:23:15,998 --> 00:23:19,277
But he's spoiled me for any other
decently groomed man in London.

287
00:23:19,278 --> 00:23:21,797
He knows everything about everything.

288
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:24,157
That's the difference between being
with a grown man

289
00:23:24,158 --> 00:23:26,238
and trying to entertain a schoolboy.

290
00:23:28,238 --> 00:23:29,678
But you love me.

291
00:23:31,398 --> 00:23:32,718
Don't you?

292
00:23:33,758 --> 00:23:35,837
Er... I overlooked you.

293
00:23:35,838 --> 00:23:40,917
Your dullness, and not knowing French
and drinking too much or too little

294
00:23:40,918 --> 00:23:45,397
and oh, I don't know, everything really,
from being all over me

295
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:49,077
the moment we were on the train
to sulking if I'm not all over you.

296
00:23:49,078 --> 00:23:51,717
Especially that side of things.

297
00:23:51,718 --> 00:23:55,958
Which became like reading a book
you've read before.

298
00:23:57,358 --> 00:24:03,918
Why can't one get a man to go away
with one and be just... light comedy?

299
00:24:05,238 --> 00:24:08,398
I say, you're not going to kill yourself,
I hope, Potty.

300
00:24:12,358 --> 00:24:15,438
I want you to swear on your
St Anthony that you won't leave me.

301
00:24:16,478 --> 00:24:19,558
- I'll do no such thing.
- Then I'll kill you if you try.

302
00:24:21,478 --> 00:24:23,437
The French understand these things.

303
00:24:23,438 --> 00:24:28,598
These hotels one has been staying in,
the notepaper is simply shaming.

304
00:24:36,998 --> 00:24:40,797
A weekend on the golf links
might do me some good,

305
00:24:40,798 --> 00:24:43,358
hobnobbing with our masters.

306
00:24:45,758 --> 00:24:48,597
I will change into my golfing togs
when we get to our digs.

307
00:24:48,598 --> 00:24:50,397
One never knows who might
be on the train.

308
00:24:50,398 --> 00:24:54,838
Mr Sandbach MP,
going down to his constituency...

309
00:24:59,518 --> 00:25:01,078
Ah!

310
00:25:04,158 --> 00:25:05,998
The proofs of my monograph.

311
00:25:16,798 --> 00:25:18,598
Sylvia asks me to take her back.

312
00:25:24,438 --> 00:25:26,398
She's joined her mother in Germany.

313
00:25:29,428 --> 00:25:33,038
- Will you take her back?
- I imagine so.

314
00:25:35,358 --> 00:25:38,317
There's the child to consider.

315
00:25:38,318 --> 00:25:40,517
Marchant says he's...

316
00:25:40,518 --> 00:25:43,078
beginning to talk like a farmer's
boy already.

317
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,797
Well, I shan't have a house again.

318
00:25:47,798 --> 00:25:52,438
There's a certain discredit attaches
to itself to a cuckold, quite properly.

319
00:25:53,598 --> 00:25:56,877
Anything beyond a flat looks like
impudence in a man

320
00:25:56,878 --> 00:25:58,998
who can't keep his wife.

321
00:26:04,478 --> 00:26:08,317
I wish you'd divorce her.
Drag her through the mud.

322
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,958
For a gentleman,
there's such a thing as...

323
00:26:13,798 --> 00:26:18,438
- Call it parade.
- And if you met someone you want to marry?

324
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:22,321
It would change nothing.
I stand for monogamy.

325
00:26:22,345 --> 00:26:25,038
- You...
- Aye, monogamy and chastity.

326
00:26:26,398 --> 00:26:28,078
And for not talking about it.

327
00:26:39,918 --> 00:26:43,478
"Better far tho hearts may break
Bid farewell for aye!

328
00:26:46,078 --> 00:26:50,278
"Lest thy sad eyes meeting mine
Tempt my soul away."

329
00:26:52,918 --> 00:26:54,318
That's great poetry.

330
00:26:55,797 --> 00:26:59,237
That's your obese poet painter
talking about it in language

331
00:26:59,238 --> 00:27:01,478
like congealed bacon fat.

332
00:27:03,958 --> 00:27:07,117
- You have a way of putting things.
- No, I haven't.

333
00:27:07,118 --> 00:27:09,958
If I had, it would make it better for me.
Here.

334
00:27:11,438 --> 00:27:16,237
"Accept resumption yoke on condition
child stay with sister Effie and Anglican.

335
00:27:16,238 --> 00:27:17,838
"Wire if acceptable."

336
00:27:21,478 --> 00:27:23,438
I for one am sorry.

337
00:27:26,998 --> 00:27:29,958
- She must have a way of putting things.
- She has.

338
00:27:32,038 --> 00:27:36,957
"I am now ready to return to you,
if I can keep Hullo Central,

339
00:27:36,958 --> 00:27:40,877
"there being no-one else
I can bear to have near me,

340
00:27:40,878 --> 00:27:43,358
"when I have retired for the night."
That's all.

341
00:27:47,758 --> 00:27:50,757
She should be the consort of the...
I don't know,

342
00:27:50,758 --> 00:27:53,718
of the Viceroy of India.

343
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:04,997
We'll get in a round of golf today.

344
00:28:04,998 --> 00:28:08,997
Tomorrow a breakfasting with the
rector who'd helped me with my book.

345
00:28:08,998 --> 00:28:10,997
But of course he did.

346
00:28:10,998 --> 00:28:14,717
You mean the Reverend Duchemin who hosted
those famous breakfasts at Cambridge?

347
00:28:14,718 --> 00:28:18,317
He's no longer at Cambridge.
He has a rectory near Rye.

348
00:28:18,318 --> 00:28:19,518
Oh.

349
00:28:24,198 --> 00:28:29,358
Lady Claudine says come and pick a
bone at Mountby. You too, Macmaster.

350
00:28:30,518 --> 00:28:34,317
Thank you, I won't.
Macmaster would be delighted.

351
00:28:34,318 --> 00:28:36,357
You're the great Macmaster?

352
00:28:36,358 --> 00:28:38,477
That's very good of you to say,
Mr Sandbach.

353
00:28:38,478 --> 00:28:43,036
- The caddie heard tell.
- Plus one at North Berwick.

354
00:28:43,718 --> 00:28:48,318
Oh, good God.
Is that Waterhouse up ahead?

355
00:29:03,358 --> 00:29:04,678
Mm.

356
00:29:06,038 --> 00:29:07,918
Hm!

357
00:29:10,638 --> 00:29:15,718
Get Chrissie back to Sylvia
as quick as you can.

358
00:29:17,078 --> 00:29:22,157
Believe me, Sylvia is a splendid girl.
Straight as a die.

359
00:29:22,158 --> 00:29:24,118
Takes her fences clean.

360
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:28,814
Chrissie must have been
running after the skirts.

361
00:29:28,838 --> 00:29:30,341
- No?
- No.

362
00:29:30,358 --> 00:29:32,717
- I dare say a little... No?
- No!

363
00:29:32,718 --> 00:29:35,117
It will be resented.

364
00:29:35,118 --> 00:29:39,158
Half the houses in London would be
closed to him, so do what you can.

365
00:29:51,918 --> 00:29:52,957
Hooked it.

366
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,437
I loathe this game.

367
00:29:55,438 --> 00:29:58,117
Why do you play, then?

368
00:29:58,118 --> 00:29:59,798
Macmaster has no-one else.

369
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:22,318
Votes for women!

370
00:30:27,558 --> 00:30:30,757
- Oi! Come here, you!
- Votes for women!

371
00:30:30,758 --> 00:30:32,878
Is it our blood you want
before you give in?

372
00:30:33,918 --> 00:30:38,357
Stop! Stop! Stop where you are!

373
00:30:38,358 --> 00:30:41,518
Votes for women! Votes for women!
Run, Gertie!

374
00:30:45,358 --> 00:30:47,318
(SHRILL WHISTLE)

375
00:30:48,958 --> 00:30:51,598
By jove! Miss Wannop!

376
00:30:53,718 --> 00:30:55,878
Suffragettes.

377
00:30:58,318 --> 00:30:59,558
Get off!

378
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,677
You're under arrest!

379
00:31:03,678 --> 00:31:04,718
Valentine!

380
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:12,558
I say, sorry to spoil your shot.

381
00:31:13,598 --> 00:31:17,437
Go and see that they don't hurt Gertie.
I've lost her.

382
00:31:17,438 --> 00:31:20,037
(DISTANT COMMOTION)

383
00:31:20,038 --> 00:31:21,677
You've been demonstrating.

384
00:31:21,678 --> 00:31:24,957
Well, of course, we have, but you
won't see a girl be manhandled.

385
00:31:24,958 --> 00:31:29,037
There looked to be some beasts
among them - a regular rat-hunt -

386
00:31:29,038 --> 00:31:30,157
and Gertie can't run.

387
00:31:30,158 --> 00:31:33,718
You cut away, then.
I'll look after Gertie.

388
00:31:34,758 --> 00:31:39,077
- No, I'll come with you.
- Clear out, unless you want to go to gaol.

389
00:31:39,078 --> 00:31:40,717
- Tally-ho!
- Help!

390
00:31:40,718 --> 00:31:41,718
Run!

391
00:31:44,398 --> 00:31:47,397
Strip the bitch naked!
Strip the bitch!

392
00:31:47,398 --> 00:31:50,078
- Stark naked!
- Stop!

393
00:31:51,918 --> 00:31:54,478
Stop! Stop! Stop!

394
00:31:58,038 --> 00:31:59,998
You couldn't have done more,
Officer.

395
00:32:01,998 --> 00:32:03,518
I expect you're a bit shaken.

396
00:32:04,918 --> 00:32:06,597
Anybody would be.

397
00:32:06,598 --> 00:32:08,198
Thank you, sir.

398
00:32:11,918 --> 00:32:13,158
Run, Gertie!

399
00:32:14,798 --> 00:32:17,718
We've got them! We've got them!

400
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:30,678
You'll have to go round
by Camber railway bridge!

401
00:32:44,878 --> 00:32:45,878
Idiot!

402
00:32:46,918 --> 00:32:48,717
I refuse to play with you.

403
00:32:48,718 --> 00:32:52,997
In fact, I've a good mind to issue a warrant
for your arrest, for obstructing justice.

404
00:32:52,998 --> 00:32:55,998
You can't. You're not a borough magistrate.
Look it up.

405
00:32:59,318 --> 00:33:01,957
Chrissie, you are the bloody limit!

406
00:33:01,958 --> 00:33:05,398
The bobby didn't want to arrest the girls.
He was yearning not to.

407
00:33:06,438 --> 00:33:13,077
Was that girl your... a friend of yours?
Had you arranged it with her?

408
00:33:13,078 --> 00:33:16,957
If it was the Wannop girl -
if the woman that's come between you

409
00:33:16,958 --> 00:33:19,517
and Sylvia, dammit,
is our little suffragette...

410
00:33:19,518 --> 00:33:22,157
- Good God!
- Put her back, Chrissie.

411
00:33:22,158 --> 00:33:23,358
I give you my word.

412
00:33:25,238 --> 00:33:27,398
They say they're all whores.

413
00:33:29,398 --> 00:33:33,637
I beg your pardon,
if you like the Wannop girl.

414
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:36,077
Her father was a great friend
of your father's.

415
00:33:36,078 --> 00:33:42,718
Of course, I remember...
Professor Wannop, the classicist.

416
00:33:44,398 --> 00:33:48,157
He didn't leave a farthing
and there's a son at Eton.

417
00:33:48,158 --> 00:33:51,357
The widow and daughter
have a deuced hard row to hoe.

418
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:55,518
I know Claudine takes them all the peaches
she can cadge out of Paul's gardener.

419
00:33:57,398 --> 00:34:00,037
Perhaps you feel sorry for her,
is that it?

420
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:02,837
I think that's enough confusion
to be going on with.

421
00:34:02,838 --> 00:34:06,437
But you should know Mrs Satterthwaite
is much recovered at her German spa

422
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:10,129
and I'm expecting to go over in a day or two
to bring Sylvia and her mother home.

423
00:34:10,141 --> 00:34:11,902
Good boy!

424
00:34:13,598 --> 00:34:20,518
Kiss her fingertips for me.
She's the real thing, you lucky beggar.

425
00:34:37,798 --> 00:34:39,997
<i>The littleness of it...</i>

426
00:34:39,998 --> 00:34:43,437
our drawing-room comedy
of sex-obsession!

427
00:34:43,438 --> 00:34:46,437
When the war comes,
it'll blow right through it, thank God!

428
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:48,037
War is impossible,

429
00:34:48,038 --> 00:34:50,437
at any rate with this country in it.

430
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:53,477
Is that what they said
at your dinner with the Tories?

431
00:34:53,478 --> 00:34:55,837
In two years, round about
grouse-shooting time,

432
00:34:55,838 --> 00:34:57,879
there'll be a European war,
with Britain plumb in the middle of it.

433
00:34:57,903 --> 00:35:00,275
Ah, the Tietjens exactitude!

434
00:35:01,078 --> 00:35:04,678
- Where's your evidence?
- In the office.

435
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:07,077
It's late.

436
00:35:07,078 --> 00:35:09,837
We're expected
at the Duchemin's breakfast -

437
00:35:09,838 --> 00:35:12,957
if you haven't been arrested.

438
00:35:12,958 --> 00:35:15,077
(THEY LAUGH)

439
00:35:15,078 --> 00:35:18,917
I gave the policeman a £5 note from
that swine of a Cabinet Minister,

440
00:35:18,918 --> 00:35:21,477
though I shouldn't call him that,
he gave me dinner.

441
00:35:21,478 --> 00:35:23,398
Besides which, he's a decent fellow.

442
00:35:24,678 --> 00:35:26,957
So it's hands off the Wannop girl.

443
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:31,237
The fair one -
Miss Valentine Wannop,

444
00:35:31,238 --> 00:35:32,997
holder of the quarter-mile,
half-mile,

445
00:35:32,998 --> 00:35:36,717
high jump and long jump records
for East Sussex,

446
00:35:36,718 --> 00:35:40,437
and housemaid-typewriter
for her mother, the novelist.

447
00:35:40,438 --> 00:35:43,237
The other one's not local,
probably London.

448
00:35:43,238 --> 00:35:46,038
Never underestimate
the Sussex constabulary.

449
00:35:47,078 --> 00:35:51,838
Oh, and it is generally believed that
Miss Wannop and I are in cahoots, if not worse.

450
00:35:56,287 --> 00:35:58,398
Why do you look like that?

451
00:36:00,198 --> 00:36:05,118
Because I'm waiting for my wife
to wire me to fetch her home.

452
00:36:06,398 --> 00:36:07,958
And this is what I look like.

453
00:36:18,535 --> 00:36:22,357
There are times when a woman hates a man,
even a very good man,

454
00:36:22,358 --> 00:36:23,397
as my husband was.

455
00:36:23,398 --> 00:36:27,917
I have walked behind a man's back
and nearly screamed with

456
00:36:27,918 --> 00:36:31,157
the desire to sink my nails
into the veins of his neck.

457
00:36:31,158 --> 00:36:33,277
And Sylvia's got it worse than I.

458
00:36:33,278 --> 00:36:37,340
If the woman, as the Church directs,
would have children and live decent.

459
00:36:37,363 --> 00:36:40,522
- But Sylvia's had a child.
- Whose?!

460
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:44,517
- That blaggard Drake's, wasn't it?
- It was probably Drake's.

461
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:46,597
I am here, you know!

462
00:36:46,598 --> 00:36:48,478
I am done with men.

463
00:36:50,238 --> 00:36:52,997
Think of all the ruin
that child has meant for me.

464
00:36:52,998 --> 00:36:55,157
And Christopher's
perfectly soppy about it.

465
00:36:55,158 --> 00:36:57,157
You don't deserve your husband,
anyway.

466
00:36:57,158 --> 00:37:00,637
I can't imagine
why he sent that telegram.

467
00:37:00,638 --> 00:37:01,917
Resume yoke, indeed!

468
00:37:01,918 --> 00:37:09,157
He sent it out of lordly, dull, full-dress
consideration that drives me distracted.

469
00:37:09,158 --> 00:37:14,197
He couldn't write me a letter, because he'd
have to put "Dear Sylvia" - and I'm not.

470
00:37:14,198 --> 00:37:17,837
He's that precise sort of imbecile.

471
00:37:17,838 --> 00:37:21,517
I'll settle down by his side
and I'll be chaste.

472
00:37:21,518 --> 00:37:26,357
I've made up my mind to it.
I'll be bored stiff for the rest of my life,

473
00:37:26,358 --> 00:37:32,158
except for one thing - I can torment that man
and I'll do it, for all the times he's tormented me.

474
00:37:36,518 --> 00:37:39,158
I've come from Normandy
without sleep, you see.

475
00:37:45,198 --> 00:37:49,877
Oh! I'll tell them downstairs
to simply telegraph Christopher,

476
00:37:49,878 --> 00:37:51,438
"Righto".

477
00:37:59,758 --> 00:38:03,437
I'll send the Reverend Duchemin
a signed copy of my book.

478
00:38:03,438 --> 00:38:05,237
His word still carries weight.

479
00:38:05,238 --> 00:38:10,837
Of course, sucking up to Duchemin was always
the price for kedgeree and poached eggs!

480
00:38:10,838 --> 00:38:12,838
(BELL TINKLES)

481
00:38:13,338 --> 00:38:16,398
Welcome! Welcome!

482
00:38:16,637 --> 00:38:19,877
I'm the curate here!

483
00:38:19,878 --> 00:38:21,358
Oh, Good Lord.

484
00:38:27,318 --> 00:38:30,037
Thank you, thank you!

485
00:38:30,038 --> 00:38:34,157
Ups-a-daisy. My name's Horsley.

486
00:38:34,158 --> 00:38:36,478
- Macmaster.
- Where did you get this job lot?

487
00:38:37,518 --> 00:38:42,157
Gosh, don't you know you've got a 13 hands
pony harness on a 16 and a half hands horse?

488
00:38:42,158 --> 00:38:45,998
Let the bit out three holes.
It's tearing the animal's tongue in half.

489
00:38:47,198 --> 00:38:50,745
I'm not sure it's playing the game,
Valentine, asking you to be here.

490
00:38:50,768 --> 00:38:52,107
If your mother knew...

491
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:56,237
Mother wanted to come with me when
I told her it was to meet a critic,

492
00:38:56,238 --> 00:38:57,718
but I got away in the carriage.

493
00:38:59,398 --> 00:39:02,558
That's perfect.
Nobody will even see your husband.

494
00:39:03,694 --> 00:39:07,169
I've told Duchemin's keeper
to keep him out till a quarter past.

495
00:39:07,193 --> 00:39:10,046
I've set a place for your Gertie,
but never mind.

496
00:39:10,070 --> 00:39:14,083
We've got the old curate's sister staying with us,
Miss Fox, and she's stone deaf!

497
00:39:14,095 --> 00:39:16,420
An empty chair next to her
makes no difference.

498
00:39:16,948 --> 00:39:18,381
This way!

499
00:39:18,404 --> 00:39:23,357
The ladies will be in here!
We arrived together! He-he!

500
00:39:23,358 --> 00:39:26,437
Miss... Good morning. I'm Macmaster.

501
00:39:26,438 --> 00:39:30,917
We're living in a state of siege, ladies.
Tee-hee!

502
00:39:30,918 --> 00:39:32,157
It's so good of you to come.

503
00:39:32,158 --> 00:39:35,037
Pleasure, thank you for having me.
Christopher Tietjens.

504
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:38,677
A pleasure indeed and you must be
the famous Vincent Macmaster.

505
00:39:38,678 --> 00:39:42,317
- Mr Sandbach MP and half a dozen...
- A pleasure, ma'am.

506
00:39:42,318 --> 00:39:45,117
- I'm Edith Duchemin and this is Miss Wannop!
- Ah, Miss Wannop!

507
00:39:45,118 --> 00:39:47,357
And armed with loaded canes...

508
00:39:47,358 --> 00:39:51,437
Gentlemen, you must be tired from your journey.
Allow me to show you to your seats.

509
00:39:51,438 --> 00:39:53,717
- Scouring the country lanes, tee-hee!
- Thank you.

510
00:39:53,718 --> 00:39:55,761
- You are here Mr Tietjens, I thought.
- Thank you.

511
00:39:55,785 --> 00:39:59,797
And here, for you, Mr Macmaster.
And I next to you!

512
00:39:59,798 --> 00:40:02,117
Drink had been taken!

513
00:40:02,118 --> 00:40:06,477
If you are hungry, there's...
Well, I hope you'll find something to your liking.

- Thank you.
- Is said to have egged them on.

515
00:40:11,438 --> 00:40:15,637
He's putting up at Lady Claudine's
for Royal duties at Dover.

516
00:40:15,638 --> 00:40:19,237
- Campion is taking the escort...
- I must thank you for yesterday.

517
00:40:19,238 --> 00:40:23,223
The Buffs' colours on the altar
of St Peter's tomorrow morning.

518
00:40:23,247 --> 00:40:25,922
Ah, Mrs Wannop, what a pleasant surprise!

519
00:40:25,946 --> 00:40:28,623
- Mother?!
- Which is Mr Macmaster, the critic?

520
00:40:32,398 --> 00:40:36,317
- Are you Mr Macmaster, the critic?
- I am Macmaster.

521
00:40:36,318 --> 00:40:42,637
Oh, Mr Macmaster, my new book
is coming out on Tuesday...

522
00:40:42,638 --> 00:40:44,757
Mother,
what have you done with Gertie?

523
00:40:44,758 --> 00:40:48,597
She's lying low in the attic...
High, rather.

524
00:40:48,598 --> 00:40:53,437
It will be of interest to you
to hear about my book.

525
00:40:53,438 --> 00:40:56,797
To you journalists, a little
inside information is always...

526
00:40:56,798 --> 00:40:58,437
I'm not a journalist!

527
00:40:58,438 --> 00:41:01,825
- Well, a critic.
- I don't review books.-

528
00:41:01,849 --> 00:41:05,397
- I'm not a critic in the sense of...
- Of course you are.

529
00:41:05,398 --> 00:41:07,077
I write for
the critical quarterlies.

530
00:41:07,078 --> 00:41:11,557
- Mr Macmaster...
- Oh, the critical quarterlies!

531
00:41:11,558 --> 00:41:17,197
Mr Horsley, sit Mrs Wannop
next to you and feed her!

532
00:41:17,198 --> 00:41:21,637
That is exactly what my book needs -
a good, long, deep...

533
00:41:21,638 --> 00:41:24,997
- Ups-a-daisy.
- That's the Reverend's chair.

534
00:41:24,998 --> 00:41:28,003
The critical quarterlies have shown
a deplorable lack of interest -

535
00:41:28,015 --> 00:41:31,455
- serious interest...
- That's better.

536
00:41:34,118 --> 00:41:38,859
- Would you allow me to help you to...?
- Oh, a little caviar. A peach!

537
00:41:39,878 --> 00:41:46,157
I'm afraid I... I'm afraid I must...
You see, my husband...

538
00:41:46,158 --> 00:41:49,077
I beg you, dear lady,
do not concern yourself.

539
00:41:49,078 --> 00:41:54,397
I think this party's very badly arranged.
Very bad management.

540
00:41:54,398 --> 00:41:56,547
Or perhaps not.
Sometimes you'd never know he was...

541
00:41:56,571 --> 00:41:58,144
One understands.

542
00:41:58,158 --> 00:42:03,317
Only to spend a fleeting hour
in these perfect surroundings.

543
00:42:03,318 --> 00:42:06,157
You know the lines,
"As when the swallow

544
00:42:06,158 --> 00:42:09,037
"gliding from lofty portal
to lofty portal,

545
00:42:09,038 --> 00:42:12,677
"out of the dark and into the light
and out again into the dark"?

546
00:42:12,678 --> 00:42:17,437
- Oh, yes! Yes! It takes a poet!
- I have a message for you, from Mr Waterhouse.

547
00:42:17,438 --> 00:42:20,148
I told him I did not know you
and did not expect to see you.

548
00:42:20,159 --> 00:42:21,921
He didn't believe me.

549
00:42:22,958 --> 00:42:25,077
If it's to invite me for a chat,

550
00:42:25,078 --> 00:42:28,037
I don't intend to place myself
in the way of his condescension.

551
00:42:28,038 --> 00:42:31,877
No, not that. He wants you to know that
there are no charges against you.

552
00:42:31,878 --> 00:42:34,437
Well, what about Gertie?

553
00:42:34,438 --> 00:42:37,289
Gertie, too,
as far as yesterday is concerned,

554
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,527
but I'd get her out from your attic,
if she's on the run from the Metropolitan Police,

555
00:42:41,551 --> 00:42:43,159
which she is.

556
00:43:00,198 --> 00:43:01,717
Parry?

557
00:43:01,718 --> 00:43:05,957
Good God, it's Parry,
the Bermondsey light-middleweight!

558
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,837
Mr Macmaster seems to know him, too.

559
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:11,318
He taught me to box at Cambridge.

560
00:43:17,358 --> 00:43:20,638
Good morning... Doctor.

561
00:43:23,398 --> 00:43:25,037
I- I'm not a doctor.

562
00:43:25,038 --> 00:43:26,997
Yes... Yes.

563
00:43:26,998 --> 00:43:32,078
The stethoscope packed in the hat
left in the hall.

564
00:43:34,878 --> 00:43:38,237
And your friend? Another medical man?

565
00:43:38,238 --> 00:43:40,877
It takes two doctors, of course,

566
00:43:40,878 --> 00:43:44,477
to certify a lunatic. Ah, Parry.

567
00:43:44,478 --> 00:43:48,277
Sole fillets - very good!
Kidneys to follow.

568
00:43:48,278 --> 00:43:49,278
Very good, sir.

569
00:43:51,398 --> 00:43:53,317
I am Macmaster.

570
00:43:53,318 --> 00:43:56,158
We corresponded
and you invited me for breakfast.

571
00:43:57,198 --> 00:43:58,557
Of course I did!

572
00:43:58,558 --> 00:44:00,278
Macmaster, the budding critic!

573
00:44:01,678 --> 00:44:03,117
And friend.

574
00:44:03,118 --> 00:44:07,677
Macmaster and friend to breakfast!

575
00:44:07,678 --> 00:44:10,118
Not medical men.

576
00:44:13,114 --> 00:44:14,994
But you look tired.

577
00:44:16,538 --> 00:44:17,778
Worn.

578
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:20,158
Worn out.

579
00:44:21,958 --> 00:44:24,358
I detect the pallor of self-abuse.

580
00:44:26,918 --> 00:44:30,837
Don't turn round.
Vincent Macmaster is quite capable.

Ah, the sorrows of spent semen!

583
00:44:36,918 --> 00:44:39,637
Sir, your fish is getting cold!
I'll bring the kidneys!

584
00:44:39,638 --> 00:44:42,424
If he'll eat a little - it brings
the blood down from the head.

585
00:44:42,447 --> 00:44:43,645
Oh, forgive!

586
00:44:44,118 --> 00:44:45,157
It's dreadful for you.

587
00:44:45,158 --> 00:44:49,088
My dear lady, please don't worry,
it's what I'm for.

588
00:44:49,099 --> 00:44:50,696
Oh, you good man.

Of course! The daughter of Professor
Wannop would know her Latin!

591
00:45:02,078 --> 00:45:04,797
I can stop this. Shall I?

592
00:45:04,798 --> 00:45:07,477
Yes. Yes, anything!

a case of having two cu..." Ugh!

You all right, sir?
It's time to write your sermon sir.

Ready? There we go.

601
00:45:42,918 --> 00:45:45,597
Dearest lady, it's all over now.
I assure you.

602
00:45:45,598 --> 00:45:49,198
Please forgive!
You can never respect me?

603
00:45:50,238 --> 00:45:52,078
You're the bravest woman I know.

Goodbye!

605
00:46:11,598 --> 00:46:14,517
This isn't the rig for you,
Mrs Wannop.

606
00:46:14,518 --> 00:46:19,077
A pony and basketwork chaise,
that's the trap for ladies.

00:46:19,078 --> 00:46:20,797
But she'll do well for
the work tonight.

608
00:46:20,798 --> 00:46:22,717
Tonight?

609
00:46:22,718 --> 00:46:25,277
Mr Tietjens means Gertie. Don't you?

610
00:46:25,278 --> 00:46:29,557
Yes. Do you know somewhere Gertie
