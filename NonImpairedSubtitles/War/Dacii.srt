1
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,100
Open the gates,

2
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,400
and we'll let you keep
your life and your freedom !

3
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,400
Who are you?

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,600
The masters of the world !

5
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:46,200
You will be, if we perish !

6
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,800
THE DACIANS

7
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,200
I got him !

8
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,700
- No, I got him !
- Well, whose arrow is this?

9
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,800
Yours. He's around here.
He can't have gone f ar.

10
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,900
Uncle Luper calls us.
We'd better go back.

11
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,800
You'd rather go back, than see
that I'm the one who got the deer.

12
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,100
Come on !

13
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,700
He's so sad !
His eyes are full of tears.

14
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,300
You were right.
It's your arrow.

15
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,300
Your aim is pretty good.

16
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,000
Have you forgotten I'm the one
who taught you how to aim?

17
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,200
Where have you been ?
I should break your bones !

18
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,700
You're making me roam
the mountains !

19
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,100
Shut up ! No...
Guess what news I bring you !

20
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,700
- What is it?
- Take a guess !

21
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,300
- The youth contest?
- Right. Next week in Argidava.

22
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,400
Come on, leave it here
and follow me ! Decebal waits for us.

23
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,800
- You'll catch me !
- Who's reaching him first?

24
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,300
- So, you're here !
- Your horse was better.

25
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,800
That's what you say.
I'm a better rider.

26
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,600
Aren't you going to help me ?

27
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,900
Will you go and fetch
some spring water?

28
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,600
Will you?

29
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:34,900
You should know that a warrior
doesn't do any woman's choir.

30
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,400
Well, you warrior !

31
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:45,100
- You'll go get some water ! Right?
- No !

32
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,700
Tell me, who's going to bring water?
Who's the one ?

33
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,900
You're hurting me !

34
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,200
You'll be sorry.
I had a surprise in store for you.

35
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,300
You're just saying so.

36
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,100
Meda !

37
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,400
- Meda ! Is he mine ?
- Yes, he's yours !

38
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,400
- Can I take it?
- Yes !

39
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:30,300
Come on !

40
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,700
Fuscus, will you show these ninnies
how to throw a spear?

41
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,600
It's the Rhine legions.

42
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,400
I bet ten jars of Falern wine

43
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,900
that his spear will thrust the eye
of the target !

44
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:35,700
Do you trust me?

45
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:39,100
I gave you your first lesson.
Prove that you deserve my trust !

46
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,000
You're on time, as always.

47
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:55,100
Tell me, how is it that our beloved
emperor Domitian

48
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,900
didn't come with you?

49
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,700
I'd have thought him much more eager
to take the credit for our victory

50
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,300
and acquire the title
of "Dacicus".

51
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:05,500
- He'll be here in four days.
- Four days, you say...

52
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,400
Yes, he's right behind me.

53
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,200
The imperial house moves slower
than the horsemen.

54
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:13,500
He has a lot of slaves,
both men and women.

55
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,000
And what women they are,
dear Fuscus !

56
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:20,500
He took everyone with him:
sorcerers, cooks...

57
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:23,700
He even took some historians with
him, artists from Asia Minor

58
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:26,200
and many accountants
to count the Dacian treasury.

59
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,800
To have his back watched,

60
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,500
the emperor took with him
the Fifth ltalica Legion.

61
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:34,000
He'd better stayed in Rome,
for the sake of all of us.

62
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,000
For our sake and for his.

63
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,700
Let's take advantage of these four
days ! You, more than anyone else.

64
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,800
- Why is it so ?
- Come !

65
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,100
Father !

66
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,200
It's been so long since I've seen
you ! You're strong like a bear now !

67
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:01,800
Forgive me ! I'm happy to see you.
I missed you and your advice.

68
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,500
You did well by yourself.
Atius, you can be proud of your son.

69
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,200
He's covered himself in glory
on all battle fields.

70
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,400
Glory and dust, also... Allow me to
wipe the traces of this long journey.

71
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,100
- You have my bath at your disposal.
- I'll hurry.

72
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:21,400
Atius... Domitian will be here
in four days.

73
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,300
How many soldiers
did he keep with him?

74
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,200
The Fifth ltalica. They were
under my command in Syria.

75
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:30,100
Their actual leader is a good
soldier, but he likes wine and money.

76
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,700
He shall have both.

77
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,600
It seems, though, that it will be
toughest to convince Severus.

78
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,500
I'm the one who taught him

79
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:43,100
to stay away from the plots
that eat away at the empire.

80
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,500
I foresee that,
during our first battle,

81
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,800
a terrible misfortune will happen
to our "divine" Domitian.

82
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:53,100
- There mustn't be any first battle.
- Atius, you know you can trust me.

83
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,600
Why don't you want
war against Dacia ?

84
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,600
Ever since we met, when you were
a poor officer with no master,

85
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,000
and up to this day, when you became
f amous and rich,

86
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,100
I've been the one
who put the questions.

87
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,700
All right. Forgive me !
We'll do it your way.

88
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:13,700
It is the right way, Fuscus.
It's always been like this.

89
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,500
My decisions were always
the best.

90
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,300
There's our hero !

91
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,900
My supper will be poorer
than Domitian's,

92
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,300
but I invite to join me
with all my heart.

93
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,800
To victory against the Dacians !

94
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,500
So...

95
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,700
You're indulging yourselves
in disgusting orgies...

96
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,800
You thought I was a tired old sag,

97
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,000
that I needed four days
to get here.

98
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,700
Why aren't you on the other side
of the river, brave Fuscus?

99
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:02,800
Look ! There's Atius, the heart
and nerve of the Roman Senate !

100
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:05,900
What are you doing here ?
You have news, haven't you?

101
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,300
Bad news, of course.
What else ?

102
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,000
I'm listening and prepared
to hear anything.

103
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,000
Funny ! Why is it that the Marcomanni
rebelled just now?

104
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,700
Maybe because
of the Dacians' gold.

105
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,400
You're either crazy, or traitors.
You want me to give up this war

106
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,400
and go back to Rome
without paying my legions?

107
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:40,000
No. You will cross the Danubius
at once !

108
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,000
I'd like to give the Senate
Fuscus' opinion, as well.

109
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:50,300
I'm a soldier and I obey Rome's law
and the decisions of the Senate.

110
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:55,100
I tell you that I would need another
five legions to defeat the Dacians.

111
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,800
Fuscus, you told me in Rome

112
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,600
that a single legion would crush
the barbarians

113
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,700
Not even the last of my soldiers
would say such a thing.

114
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:06,500
You've been plotting against me.
You'd like to see me back to Rome,

115
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:09,900
defeated by the Dacians and with
all legions unpaid and dissatisfied.

116
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,500
What do you have to say,
Severus?

117
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,800
I'm for going to war.

118
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:19,700
Let's not forget that Julius Caesar
said the clash with the Dacians

119
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,600
would be more difficult
than the one with the Gauls.

120
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:28,100
Now I want to meditate more
about Caesar's end, than his words.

121
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,200
Domitian, let's be frank !

122
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,500
You're interested more in Decebal's
gold, than in a battlefield victory.

123
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:39,000
I always said that rich people
are also the most intelligent.

124
00:14:39,100 --> 00:14:41,500
Don't you think that several
messengers led by a shrewd man

125
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,400
would get from Decebal what you
want so badly, but without a war?

126
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,400
Who might this man be?

127
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,700
When I came from Asia Minor,
ten years ago,

128
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,200
I had some fruitful negotiations
with Duras, the former Dacian king.

129
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:57,100
All right. You go, then ! But take
one of my personal guards with you.

130
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,300
Meanwhile, you build the bridge !

131
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:02,300
You'll plea a better argument
in front of the barbarians,

132
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:06,200
if our twelve legions will be
on the left shore of the Danubius.

133
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,900
I'll be merciful with the barbarians.

134
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:13,100
After all, I don't like wars.

135
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:20,200
I might be a poet,
had I not in mind Nero's fate.

136
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,700
It was a short reunion.

137
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:45,200
Allow me to come with you
on the other shore !

138
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,700
I wanted to ask you
the same thing.

139
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,800
I've been waiting for this moment
for so many years !

140
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,200
I waited for it and feared it.

141
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,200
I'd like to understand you.

142
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,700
There are so many things
we don't understand, my son !

143
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,500
We're like a shell wanting to gather
the immensity and howl of the sea.

144
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,500
Sometimes, life makes us hide
before our most beloved.

145
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,300
Son, do you trust me ?

146
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:48,500
You know too well that you matter
the most to me, of all things.

147
00:17:19,100 --> 00:17:21,700
I'd like to stay with you
for a few more moments.

148
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,500
Yes, f ather. I'll announce the guard
that must come with you.

149
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,900
Search everywhere !

150
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,400
Domitian, let me be the one
who starts the battle !

151
00:18:54,400 --> 00:19:00,800
The Senate and the Roman people
lost our very best man.

152
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,500
I'm in pain.

153
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:09,700
I'll send the urn with his ashes
in Rome,

154
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:16,800
the city he loved and served
like no other.

155
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:25,100
And those barbarians will know
Rome's wrath !

156
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:01,600
Only five of you are left
in the great contest.

157
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,800
Fight bravely !
May the best win !

158
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:48,700
- There are only three left !
- Now you can see my teaching skills.

159
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,500
But, to be honest,
I'd have been better !

160
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,000
See ?

161
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:36,800
Decebal, the Romans are crossing
the Donaris.

162
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,200
I've killed their first nobleman
who trod on our land.

163
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:59,600
He was the only Roman
who shouldn't have died.

164
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:03,700
I thought that... it was a good
thing.

165
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,700
Cotizo !
Don't win this contest !

166
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:20,700
- You're crazy.
- I'm not.

167
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,300
There's going to be a war, Cotizo.
Please, don't win the contest !

168
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,300
- Do you hear me ?
- All right.

169
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,100
Promise me !

170
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,100
I promise... I'll win the contest.

171
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:35,700
Decebal !
Our best warrior won the contest.

172
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,000
It's your son !

173
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,600
No !

174
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:56,000
We'll wait for them here
and we'll crush them like ants.

175
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,300
What does this mean ?

176
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,900
You want that l, Luper, run from
the Roman's faces like a woman?

177
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:09,200
There are twelve legions,
that is 72 354 men.

178
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,300
They are led by general Fuscus.

179
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,000
- How do you know that?
- Zoltes told me.

180
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,700
From now on until we die
or beat them,

181
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,800
I'm the one who gives
the orders !

182
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,900
The children, women and old people
will go in the mountains.

183
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,500
You'll keep the Romans here
until midnight.

184
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:39,800
Don't you dare die like a hero,
or I'll break your bones !

185
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,400
Father, you didn't teach us to flee.
Why aren't we f acing the Romans?

186
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,200
We must avoid this war,
Cotizo.

187
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,100
Forgive me,
but you talk like Meda.

188
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:22,900
If I were you, I wouldn't turn
my back on the Romans.

189
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:27,300
My son, is it that you and the
others don't trust me anymore ?

190
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,700
I didn't want to say this. Everybody
loves you and will follow you.

191
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,100
I'm proud to be your son.

192
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,900
Go !

193
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,000
Take Meda and help the other
people ! I'll reach you later.

194
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,500
It looks deserted.

195
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,500
Yes... It's for the first time
they greet us with flowers.

196
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:20,000
They're withdrawing their troops.
We put them on the run.

197
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,300
No, young man.
The charge is ahead. Look !

198
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,900
Faster ! Come on !

199
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,500
We must survive until midnight !

200
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:56,300
Do you hear me ?
We must ! Hurry up !

201
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:03,700
We will take the fortress !
Cavalry... Charge !

202
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:04,500
Fuscus !

203
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,700
Your bravery on the battlefield
commends you.

204
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:40,500
Your f ather, the illustrious Atius,
will be avenged.

205
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,800
What a stench !

206
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:47,400
And now, Fuscus, the prisoners...

207
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,600
Marcus !

208
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,500
What is this?
You have only one prisoner?

209
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,500
You fought well.

210
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,200
Speak, and you'll know
Rome's generosity !

211
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,700
Where is Decebal ?

212
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:41,600
Had I also a weapon,
you wouldn't be so brave.

213
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,500
I can see you didn't wash
your f ace.

214
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:47,100
Do you want a weapon ?

215
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,100
Take it !

216
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,000
Quite shiny...

217
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,900
And tasteless.

218
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:08,800
Are all these necessary,

219
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:11,500
for a bunch of barbarians
who are giving themselves in ?

220
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:16,400
Domitian, this is Burebista's throne,
one of Caesar's mightiest opponents.

221
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:19,600
If you receive them here,
they will be impressed.

222
00:38:19,700 --> 00:38:24,500
Let's impress them then, Fuscus !
Let the barbarians in !

223
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,700
Which one of you is Decebal ?

224
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,700
Decebal is the great king
of the free Dacians.

225
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:56,800
We are bearing his message
to the Roman emperor Domitian.

226
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,500
Are you that one ?

227
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,300
I'm listening.

228
00:39:24,500 --> 00:39:27,300
A mouse... A frog...

229
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:34,500
A bird... A quiver of spears...

230
00:39:36,300 --> 00:39:37,500
A plough knife...

231
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:44,600
Your message pleased me.
I'm for peace.

232
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,100
My conditions will be sent to Decebal
by my messenger.

233
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,200
Give these messengers
a tour of our camp !

234
00:39:53,700 --> 00:39:55,900
They should see most of it !

235
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:11,400
Describe their awe and astonishment,
at the sight of my wisdom !

236
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:18,200
Fuscus, do you know
what all these mean ?

237
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:24,600
It's a common habit
with the barbarians.

238
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:28,900
They are hiding their pride
through silly fables.

239
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:33,700
The mouse is the land,
the frog, the waters.

240
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:38,800
The bird is the sky and its freedom.
The spears are their weapons

241
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,200
and the plough knife
is the plenty of the land.

242
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:44,600
Rest assured that Decebal
submits to you !

243
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:48,100
Write it down !

244
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:53,900
My dear Fuscus, you have once again
astonished me with your wit.

245
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,800
You can do as you please
with these animals.

246
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:02,200
I'll keep the cages
as a memory of your insight.

247
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,700
Severus will deliver our answer.

248
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,700
Hail, Decebal !

249
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:46,400
Welcome, general Severus !

250
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:51,100
What is the message
of your master?

251
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,500
Domitian, emperor of Rome,

252
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:57,800
has willingly deciphered your
message and here's his answer.

253
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,800
He accepts your surrender.

254
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,500
He'll come to Sarmizegetusa
and will crown you himself

255
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,300
as king of Dacia and subject
of undefeated Rome.

256
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:10,800
The Senate will nominate you,
Decebal, for your merits,

257
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:14,400
a friend of the Roman people.

258
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:17,000
This is all.

259
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:32,100
General Severus, according
to our ancestors' custom,

260
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,400
you are our guests.

261
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:38,700
Drink the wine of this earth,
where Dionysus was born !

262
00:42:39,900 --> 00:42:43,000
Tomorrow we'll talk
about masters and slaves,

263
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,000
for tomorrow we'll know each other
better.

264
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,200
It's your turn, Roman boy.

265
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:16,500
I want to ask you something,
Decebal.

266
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,700
Wherever my f ate and my gods
lead me,

267
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:21,500
I try to understand the life
of those we fight against.

268
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,900
Tell me, why do the Dacians laugh
before dying?

269
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,300
You're bragging that you saw
Dacians die, you Roman !

270
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:32,500
Meda, pour a cup of wine
for our guest !

271
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,900
Forgive me, father.
I'm not any Roman's slave.

272
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,400
This Roman is my guest.
Pour him some wine, Meda !

273
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:58,700
Come on, warrior,
take some raspberies !

274
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:09,300
Forgive me if I insist, Decebal,
but this is very important for me.

275
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:13,300
Why do the Dacians laugh
before dying?

276
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,900
Zalmoxis gave us several lives,
Severus.

277
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,300
How could we leave this life
and live another,

278
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:25,300
where other secrets of the skies
and earth are to be revealed to us?

279
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:30,800
Crying and moaning? Or laughing,
so that Zalmoxis may see our joy?

280
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:35,100
But how do the Romans die,
general Severus?

281
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:41,300
We'll see them soon.

282
00:44:41,400 --> 00:44:45,200
Forgive my children, general !
They are like young wolves.

283
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:48,200
They must bite,
to have their teeth grown.

284
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,400
Where do you have
this medallion ?

285
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,800
My father gave it to me.

286
00:44:55,100 --> 00:44:58,300
Atius was the only Roman
whose death I did not want.

287
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:03,100
There are many things
we don't understand, Severus.

288
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:09,500
We are like a shell which wants
to gather the great howl of the sea

289
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,500
and its secrets.

290
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,500
I would very much like
to understand this, Decebal.

291
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,200
Come with me, and you will.

292
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,300
We have plenty of gold,
Severus.

293
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:44,500
Maybe gold and wealth
are our curse.

294
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:49,700
They spark the hatred or the
excessive love of foreigners.

295
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:53,400
Some of them are strong.
They haven't been defeated.

296
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,000
I know that.
I always hosted them as friends,

297
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,100
and never as masters.
This is the law of this land

298
00:46:03,100 --> 00:46:04,700
and of every man.

299
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:10,300
If we who live today are to die,
the law will stay the same.

300
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:34,600
Here lie the ashes of those
who fought for us,

301
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:38,800
so that we may never feel
the harsh rule of other strangers.

302
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:44,700
Here lie kings, priests,
clan leaders...

303
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,400
Oroles, Burebista...

304
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,400
Deceneus, Scorilo...

305
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:02,500
And this urn was supposed to shelter
the ashes of great Zoltes,

306
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:10,300
whom you knew under the name
of Atius, your f ather.

307
00:47:12,900 --> 00:47:15,500
He went to Rome 40 years ago

308
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,400
and took the name of a Roman
patrician who lived in Moesia.

309
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,100
Each year, I would send him
a vessel full of gold.

310
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,300
Rome opened its gates to him.
Gold is a wonderful key.

311
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,000
Atius told me every plot
weaved in Rome.

312
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,400
Now I see why he didn't want
to fight against you.

313
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,900
His death, the earth in his fist...

314
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,300
Why didn't he ever talked to me
about this?

315
00:47:56,900 --> 00:48:00,900
He taught you to be a fine warrior
in the world's greatest army,

316
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,400
so that you may serve your people
one day.

317
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,400
You were much too young
for him to unveil his secret.

318
00:48:12,100 --> 00:48:14,100
Today is too late.

319
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,400
What do you want from me
now?

320
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:20,700
What have you stirred
in the heart of Zoltes' son?

321
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:26,100
Even the tamed wolf returns to the
woods when his kind calls him.

322
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:29,100
Was my call strong enough ?

323
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:34,900
Now you're as lonely as I am,
in the belly of the earth,

324
00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:40,200
waiting for Zalmoxis' signs.
Will you be able to defeat them?

325
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:45,500
They lost battles, but they were
never defeated.

326
00:49:47,100 --> 00:49:52,000
They're stubborn, strong,
numerous and greedy.

327
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,500
Then, let's give them the gold
they are asking for.

328
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,100
Never !

329
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,700
I kept my soul in darkness
and solitude.

330
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:05,400
It judges the world by other measures
than those of ordinary people.

331
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,500
Sometimes, it's harder for us
to subdue our pride

332
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,300
than to win a battle.

333
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:17,400
Think, Decebal ! Wouldn't it be
better for you to subdue your pride ?

334
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:22,200
Great priest,
if people on this earth of ours

335
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,100
learn that they can live like slaves,
then, we are defeated forever.

336
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:30,800
But if we fight so bravely that,
several centuries later,

337
00:50:31,000 --> 00:50:35,000
those who want to surrender
will be ashamed,

338
00:50:36,200 --> 00:50:39,800
it means we won the battle
and we'll stay here,

339
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,600
no matter how many storms
we wil f ace.

340
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:46,700
Decebal...

341
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:53,400
If you decide to go to war, you must
send a messenger to Zalmoxis.

342
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:59,300
You know our ancient law.
The messenger will be...

343
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:03,500
I know.
