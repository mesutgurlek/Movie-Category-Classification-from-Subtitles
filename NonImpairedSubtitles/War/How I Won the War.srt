00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,670
THE RHINE, GERMANY 1945

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:22,157
Third Troop, Fourth Musketeers.
Come on, come on.

3
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:24,236
Move yourselves.

4
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,799
Third Troop, Fourth Musketeers.
Come on, come on.

5
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,236
Come on.
Third Troop, Fourth Musketeers.

6
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,997
<i>(shot)</i>

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,677
Inflating parties forward.

8
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,996
<i>(releases air valve)</i>

9
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,116
Embark!

10
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:03,117
Follow me.

11
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,912
Paddles out.

12
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,837
Prepare to paddle.

13
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,916
Paddle.

14
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,117
<i>(gun cocks)</i>

15
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,719
Yes, during the war,
I was a Musketeer myself.

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,832
We had one young John Thomas
ostensibly commanding.

17
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,155
More myself was the backbone, of course.

18
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,874
Of a dark night,
many of our officers... <i>(clicks)</i>

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,991
...by some of their own men. You had to.

20
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,350
- <i>(cash till rings)</i>
- Yes, I will, squire.

21
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,550
Yeah, that's right, you was there.

22
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:42,636
After breakfasting in Paddington,

23
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:45,911
we was transferred to the Second Army
for Rhine and Other Rivers.

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,989
Ours was an infantry role though many
of us could swim only loosely, if at all.

25
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:55,636
- It was a complete cock-up.
- 144177 Musketeer Brazier S.

26
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:58,194
No, no, how <i>I</i> won the war.

27
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:02,869
The memoirs
of Lieutenant Ernest Goodbody.

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,838
<i>("Auf Wiedersehen, Sweetheart")</i>

29
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,515
<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>

30
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,113
<i>Auf Wiedersehen</i>

31
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:26,590
<i>We'll meet again, sweetheart</i>

32
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,718
<i>This lovely day</i>

33
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,992
<i>Has flown away</i>

34
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,233
<i>The time has come</i>

35
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:43,631
<i>To part</i>

36
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,715
<i>(screams)</i>

37
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:48,628
<i>We'll kiss again</i>

38
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:53,151
<i>Like this again</i>

39
00:02:53,280 --> 00:03:01,631
<i>Don't let the teardrops start</i>

40
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:06,072
<i>With love that's true</i>

41
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,239
<i>I'll wait for you</i>

42
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:18,517
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, sweetheart</i>

43
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,153
I'll tell you nothing
but my name, rank and number.

44
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,714
My number is 131313.

45
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,310
Lieutenant of Musket Ernest Goodbody.

46
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,035
It all started in 1939.
I suppose it did for you too.

47
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,549
But then first things first.

48
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,469
War is without doubt
the noblest of games.

49
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,353
Finer, I think, Corporal of Musket.

50
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:55,598
Corporal of Musket Transom,
my troop sergeant and a good all-rounder.

51
00:03:55,720 --> 00:04:00,714
Stay there. You, Juniper,
you're perfect where you are. Very square.

52
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:07,315
Musketeer Juniper, a joy to have
on any team, one of the original BEFs.

53
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:10,876
What they really thought of me,
I shall never know.

54
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,551
- I thought he was bleeding rubbish.
- I thought he was a bleeding tart.

55
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,355
Can I have you right out there
in the country, Gripweed?

56
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:23,758
Musketeer Gripweed, without whom these
memoirs would never have been written.

57
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,553
My faithful batman.

58
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,194
May I rub your ball, sir?
It gives me pleasure.

59
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:33,199
- Musketeer Drogue, I die in North Africa.
- Please.

60
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,072
We're gonna hang out the washing
on the Siegfried Line

61
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:53,275
I rallied to the flag in October 1939

62
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,269
and was immediately selected
as officer potential.

63
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:04,032
Every word of this film is written
in pencil in my own handwriting.

64
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,229
<i>I owe my introduction to the art of war</i>
<i>to my instructors at No.212 OCTU.</i>

65
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:14,433
<i>In particular,</i>
<i>1431 Lieutenant Colonel Grapple,</i>

66
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,031
<i>later to be known as Grapple</i>
<i>of the Bedoo, who impressed me no end.</i>

67
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:22,709
<i>I took care to talk as far back</i>
<i>in the mouth as possible,</i>

68
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:25,912
<i>being a grammar school lad...</i>
<i>which made no difference.</i>

69
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,077
<i>I've always been treated</i>
<i>by the army as top drawer.</i>

70
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,192
<i>- (affected laughter)</i>
- What did you say?

71
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:36,392
<i>(laughs)</i> Sir...

72
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,192
Never underrate the wily Pathan.

73
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,518
We are going onto the wily Pathan
and the use of anti-gas carpet.

74
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:47,995
- Ya... Ya...
- The Pathan lives in India.

75
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:51,954
India is a hot, strange country,
full of wily Pathans up to wily things.

76
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,038
Which is why I always wear spurs,
even in cold weather.

77
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,995
My advice is to keep your rifle strapped
to a suitable portion of your body.

78
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:03,999
A leg is good. Otherwise,
the wily Pathan will strip himself naked,

79
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,509
grease himself all over,
slippery as an eel,

80
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:09,598
make off with your rifle,
which is a crime. Any questions?

81
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:14,589
- Or can we take gas?
- Has the Pathan gone over to Hitler, sir?

82
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,950
- Grammar school boy?
- Sir.

83
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,197
No, he has not.
Too wily for that, the wily Pathan.

84
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:25,471
Then shall we be fighting him
in this war, sir?

85
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:28,910
Of course, the British army
has always fought the wily Pathan.

86
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,316
Stripped naked under the tent brailings
like a snake, he is.

87
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,396
- Why?
- Why what?

88
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,512
We want to get on to gas.
It may save your life one day.

89
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,677
Why has the British army
always fought the wily Pathan?

90
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,190
He's just like you, a damn troublemaker.
What's your name?

91
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,630
How did you get into OCTU
not knowing your history?

92
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,436
God help your men.
They'll be torn apart by the wily Pathan.

93
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:57,393
See your dugouts.
Stand by your dugouts. Stand to. Dig in.

94
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,992
To beat the Hun, dig in then break
through with sword and lance. I think.

95
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,430
Do your best, eh? That's good...

96
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,870
- Body, sir. This is.
- That's very good, Body.

97
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,115
- It is rather wet inside, sir.
- I know it is.

98
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:19,392
That smell. That smell.

99
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:22,512
Light the little candle, eh?

100
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:27,589
This is where the war will be fought.
War of movement, my bum.

101
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,916
Sit down, Body.

102
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,438
Thank you, sir.

103
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:39,917
You're going to be an officer, young Body.

104
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,952
- I wonder if you know what that means.
- I think so, sir.

105
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,915
- What does it mean, Body?
- It means my mother will be pleased, sir.

106
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,558
I worry about your men, Body.
That's what being an officer means.

107
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,719
You know... I think you know
how England is fixed at the moment.

108
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,594
It's not a question of money, sir.
I'll serve for nothing.

109
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,472
Tell me about yourself...

110
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:08,913
What I hope I'm saying about England
is that we have no submachine guns,

111
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,670
no rimless cartridges, percussion
grenades, field artillery, no tanks much,

112
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,349
no anti-tanks ever,
no dive bombers, no bombs,

113
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:20,597
and we invented shrapnel.
Knew him well... His son.

114
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:27,239
I can't, I fear, I can't march properly
on my own as an officer in the public eye.

115
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,440
Isn't that sickening
when that happens to a chap?

116
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,028
Couldn't your drill instructor
do something?

117
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,311
A quick jab up the crutch.
With a broom?

118
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,150
"They're Coming."
"They're Coming" by EC Grapple MC VD.

119
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,713
And scar.

120
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,990
"They're Coming."

121
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,793
They're coming from the shires
Coming from the byres

122
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,990
They're coming from the cities and towns

123
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:03,989
They're coming from the factories
They're coming from the farms...

124
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,509
- You married?
- No, I play the harmonica.

125
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:11,191
I'm coming after you civil reservists
to see if you can remember about rifles

126
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,880
and thumbs down the seams
of your slacks,

127
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,992
into your pink civvy thoughts
with my big black boots,

128
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,795
bearing a big, black, knobbly stick.

129
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,480
So take a hold of yourselves. Stand still.

130
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,919
- Face your front.
- I am.

131
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,395
Squad, 'shun!

132
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,988
- Down them rifles.
- Rifles!

133
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,839
- Splinter.
- Slope arms.

134
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,110
Two, three, across...

135
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,992
- Hands...
- Down!

136
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,872
<i>(Transom)</i> Throw them rifles.

137
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,956
- Will advance.
- Front, Clapper.

138
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,709
- Splinter.
- By the right, quick march.

139
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:48,276
Left, right, left, right, left...

140
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,231
<i>(Grapple) Coming dressed in overalls...</i>

141
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,670
- Retire. About.
- <i>Coming with umbrellas...</i>

142
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:57,190
<i>- Coming bringing gifts...</i>
- Turn!

143
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,709
Stand still. Those two men, about.

144
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,428
Don't speak to me like that.
I'm a married man.

145
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:09,632
About turn.

146
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,558
By the right, quick march.

147
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,799
What's this? Halt.

148
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:24,754
Stand still. Never, ever
have I seen such a sight.

149
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,235
- Am I hurting you?
- No.

150
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,920
I should be. I'm standing on your hair.

151
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,190
- Who said that?
- Is this North Africa?

152
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,390
- Catterick.
- Marching like idiots.

153
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:36,238
- Never...
- In all my life!

154
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,433
It really is only a question of getting
the right leg to respond to my brain.

155
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,393
Move to the right in threes.

156
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,080
- Wait for it.
- Where are you going? Still.

157
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,998
- It's no good to me.
- My finger. There's a splinter.

158
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:53,557
- Right in threes. Right turn.
- Would you go sick?

159
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:56,877
- I want to fight.
- That's the spirit.

160
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,276
- Who's the one in the flat hat?
- Baden-Powell.

161
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:04,996
Fall in, you.
On the command, move. Move.

162
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,112
Don't look at him, look at me.

163
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,310
If you look at him,
I'll give you to him.

164
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,798
You can be put into his hands.
You can spend your life with such as him.

165
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,229
- Oh...
- <i>Brain, brawn and guile...</i>

166
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:22,035
They're coming dressed in overalls
Coming dressed in tweed...

167
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,833
To the front, salute.

168
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,791
- As you were.
- Hit them rifles.

169
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,630
You won't break them.
To the front, salute!

170
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:37,232
Of skin and guts and fortitude
Of brain and brawn and guile

171
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:41,717
And what is more,
they're yours, young man

172
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,796
See you do well by them.

173
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,876
<i>(piano flourish)</i>

174
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,791
<i>(sparse applause)</i>

175
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:58,839
<i>(Goodbody) I'll never forget the moment</i>
<i>I was appointed to my first command.</i>

176
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,791
No...

177
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:02,797
- Oh...
- Him!

178
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:06,151
Squad, 'shun.

179
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:17,310
- We're all going to die.
- I'm gonna die in North Africa.

180
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,193
Come, now, be fair.
Not all of us, Corporal of Musket.

181
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,754
- There will be survivors.
- <i>(machine gun)</i>

182
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,189
Many of us, even, will survive training.

183
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,357
It's personal. Can I speak to you
on a personal matter?

184
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,199
Personal? Keep your rear down.

185
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,074
It's her, sir. She's getting stuffed the
jacksy off her by the man from the Pru.

186
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,236
Jacksy?

187
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,191
That is posterior, that is.

188
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,908
Some spy says he gets his hoggins
every Monday, regular as dick,

189
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:48,032
along with the 18d funeral policy.

190
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,277
- Hoggins?
- Is it right, sir?

191
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,154
- Is he intimate?
- He's no friend of mine, sir.

192
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,678
I ask you, in all conscience,

193
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:03,316
is it right that a serviceman is forced
to carnal knowledge for the insurance?

194
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:05,396
No, no, decidedly not.

195
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,870
I'll do anything you advise, sir.

196
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,630
Well, Clapper, is your good lady wife
a willing partner to this hoggins?

197
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:16,593
No, sir. It's this damn war.
It's got her excited.

198
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,598
And him, he's suave.

199
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:22,473
- Go on.
- Not in my silk stockings!

200
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,873
Here, you've brought
your child's gas mask.

201
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,152
Oh, no, not in front
of your child's gas mask.

202
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:36,398
Well, Clapper, lapse the policy.
It's yours, isn't it?

203
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:40,149
Good. Then lapse it. You don't need
a funeral policy in the army.

204
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,236
You get the last post.

205
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:48,636
My word.

206
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,991
Then the insurance will not call
on a Monday for his hoggins.

207
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,113
My life. What you've saved
is my life and my honey pot.

208
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:01,750
Do you mind if I gives
a jump of admiration here, sir?

209
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:10,356
Dirty bleeder. He'll have to entertain
somewhere else to obtain satisfaction.

210
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,313
Hold on, I'll rescue you, Clapper.

211
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,795
<i>We didn't all die.</i>
<i>I often didn't feel well.</i>

212
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,037
<i>But I put a brave face on it</i>
<i>and we were soon sent to Egypt,</i>

213
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:26,280
<i>it seemed at the time,</i>
<i>where I volunteered myself. Didn't we all?</i>

214
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,994
What the bloody hell are you doing here?

215
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,351
I'm here, sir, at your convenience.

216
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:36,912
Ernest.

217
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,429
I know the names of all my men, sir.

218
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,678
Come over here.
Your eyes are bright.

219
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,588
- My knees are brown, sir.
- Nice, I've got brown knees.

220
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,430
You'd like to get away from here,
Ernest, wouldn't you? See some action.

221
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,791
- My sole ambition, sir.
- I know.

222
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,199
Ernest, I want you to take your troop of
musketeers and go and do this job for me.

223
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,438
If you do it well, you need never
hang around on street corners again.

224
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,599
You can go away and do stirring things.
Would you like that?

225
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:11,995
Oh, sir.

226
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,556
Sir, I'd give my right arm and leg.

227
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:21,152
It's not you, sir.
I'm not bored with you. I love you.

228
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,909
In a strict metaphorical way
of speaking, as it were.

229
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:31,479
I'd give them my arm and leg.
Damn sporting of you, sir.

230
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,636
The lads will be chuffed.

231
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,996
- <i>(gulps)</i>
- I gulped.

232
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,192
I used to gulp like a fish
every time a general touched me.

233
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,949
One time, when I was a subaltern...
Nice eyes.

234
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:47,392
We are exchanging bubblegum cards.
We are staff officers.

235
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,393
- Have you got <i>Dunkirk?</i>
- Toby's got <i>Dunkirk.</i>

236
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:54,557
There's a lot of <i>Dunkirk</i> about.
Ghastly colours.

237
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:58,116
- I do a bit of Sunday painting myself.
- I want <i>School Bombing.</i>

238
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,596
- We know what you want, Toby.
- I want <i>School Bombing.</i>

239
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:04,632
- <i>(laughter)</i>
- Not much doubt about morale here, eh?

240
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,469
It's funny when the killing starts.
Some of them don't like it.

241
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,912
That's where you come in. I want you
to set up an advanced area cricket pitch.

242
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,713
Did you think you can do that?
Can you read a map?

243
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,877
239451 or thereabouts, near an oasis.

244
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,833
Get some grass if you can.
Doesn't matter if you can't.

245
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,997
I want it first class,
and I want it in September.

246
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:29,750
That means you have three days from
the time you land behind enemy lines.

247
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:34,112
It's got to be a good pitch because
a very important bod is going to see it.

248
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,869
- How much is she?
- Does she take bully beef?

249
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,356
He's going to come up out
of the torment of the noblest of games

250
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,869
and hear the sharp click
of leather on willow.

251
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,391
Ah, with his weary soldier boys.
That'll show them, bring their tails up.

252
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:55,358
Show this very important bod just how
high the British soldier can get his tail.

253
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,153
Yes, I want it first class and in three days.
That doesn't give you much time.

254
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,272
I want you to go all out.
Will you go all out for me?

255
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,960
Just remember my standing orders.
Usual thing.

256
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:14,154
Let no man surrender
if he is wounded and can fight.

257
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:17,113
- Need I say more?
- No, sir.

258
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,873
And thank you, sir, for your faith.

259
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:28,108
I'll do what I can to tire her out, sir,
so these young soldiers don't get hurt.

260
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:53,070
Hey, hey, hey. It's a dangerous job
and it's an important job.

261
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,839
The next three days
are not going to be a picnic.

262
00:17:55,960 --> 00:18:00,511
I want you to come to me not only as
a troop leader - and it is a good troop -

263
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,915
but also as a friend.

264
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:07,556
Should you have any doubts, problems,
do not hesitate to come to me.

265
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,993
I want you to feel you can come to me
for help as you would your own father.

266
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,430
Hello, Dad, Mum's been looking
all over the shop for you.

267
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,799
Back! Mines!

268
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,876
Reverse engines!

269
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,956
<i>(yells)</i>

270
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,428
Hard astern.

271
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,918
To me, sir! Troop!

272
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,950
Good job I saw that. Good job, eh?

273
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,358
Very heavily mined, you'll find, I'm sure.
We're best out of here.

274
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:47,719
To me.

275
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,628
Rally to me, Third Troop.

276
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:06,790
If it is humanly possible.

277
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,513
I shouldn't be left on my own.

278
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,396
I can't win a war on my own.

279
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:16,796
I'm rather too young.

280
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:24,156
I feel I'm folding up like a telescope.

281
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,789
I hold the DSO. I do hold the DSO, after all.

282
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,957
- Commando?
- No.

283
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,310
On your feet.

284
00:19:52,680 --> 00:19:54,636
<i>(speaks German)</i>

285
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:06,676
Come inside.

286
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:24,155
You are Number 1331490?

287
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,551
Lieutenant Ernest Goodbody
of His Majesty's Brigade of Musketeers.

288
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:32,319
Huh? Educated
at Wellington and Marlborough.

289
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,070
Before the war, a solicitor in the firm
of Nicholas, Collins & Osgood.

290
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:40,636
- Am I right?
- No. Sir.

291
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:43,513
The name is right,
but all the rest is wrong.

292
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:50,438
Oh, well, just a guess.
We are not all supermen.

293
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,913
<i>(whistles)</i>

294
00:20:58,560 --> 00:21:03,759
Home is favourite. You wouldn't want us
making a nuisance of ourselves out there.

295
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:05,996
- Use your initiative.
- I ain't got none.

296
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:09,914
- Come on. Off, Pongo.
- Matelot! Whose bloody side are you on?

297
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:15,558
It's a great gamble for a great stake
and I pray to God that it comes off.

298
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:19,559
- I like a game of cricket myself.
- Don't you know there's a war on, jack?

299
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:23,355
Oh, come on, don't give me that.
The sea has always bred heroes.

300
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:28,600
At the battle of Trafalgar, one of the
French captains had both legs blown off.

301
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:32,190
- And he directed his men to the end.
- I'll see what I can do for you.

302
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:38,475
- More than my job's worth.
- Mount, come on. <i>Juldi</i>/ Drivers, start up!

303
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:46,355
We do have some drivers, don't we?
Well, who drove them on? I did.

304
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:54,989
Clutch in, move gear, pedal down,
clutch out, now all together.

305
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,352
<i>(all)</i> Clutch in, move gear,
pedal down, clutch out.

306
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:07,153
Very good.

307
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:24,439
Come on, come on. Give me some speed.
Put that brake on.

308
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:29,156
Clutch. Don't get too near the man in front.

309
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:30,872
It's working.

310
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,956
It this absolutely North Africa?

311
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:36,355
Because I'd like you
to have my best boots.

312
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:40,951
I don't want your best boots.
Gear in. Accelerator down. Best boots(!)

313
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:45,631
No, they're good lads.
They'd follow you anywhere.

314
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,309
Hark at them, gazing on me
with their trusting little eyes.

315
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,351
- Sir.
- Shufty.

316
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:56,031
My feet's wet, sir. Sir, my feet's wet.

317
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:59,994
- It's disgusting. They are manky.
- Well, they're yours.

318
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:03,157
- You gave them toys.
- Yours.

319
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,317
I haven't been able to command respect
since before the war.

320
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:10,274
Right, stop! Stop!

321
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:13,597
Stop!

322
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,073
Then they're Mr Goodbody's,
who we seem to have mislaid.

323
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:21,671
We'll do our best to find him. I'm gonna
shoot the bleeder, dropping me in it.

324
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,633
Out, Gripweed. Handbrake on.

325
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,318
Come here.

326
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:29,113
- Is your feet, Gripweed, wet?
- No.

327
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,198
You're giving me lies.
Goodbody will want to see your feet.

328
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,949
- They dried.
- Then you best get them wet again. Move!

329
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,071
- At the double.
- At the double.

330
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:41,636
- Anybody else?
- Left, right, left, right...

331
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,228
<i>- (horn)</i>
- Sarge!

<i>(horn blares)</i>

333
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,830
I'll teach you to try
to put the blame on me.

334
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,032
That was a nasty moment.
Right, all together now.

335
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,075
- Mr Goodbody, sir.
- <i>(all)</i> Mr Goodbody, sir.

339
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,429
Seen any Musketeers
swanning about, trooper?

340
00:24:24,560 --> 00:24:26,516
Come here.

341
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,468
Come here.

<i>All stations, report my signal.</i>
<i>Peter Nan Oboe... Peter Nan Oboe...</i>

343
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:42,350
Fourth Muskets, aren't you?
Been expecting you.

344
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:45,472
- Blue, white and two reds.
- I'm green, green, green, sir.

345
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,670
Oh, I know you are.

346
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:50,872
Well, keep out of my way
until the pitch is ready to play.

347
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,913
<i>Peter Nan Oboe...</i>
<i>Hello, all stations, report my signal.</i>

348
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,508
- Where are they?
- Who, sir?

349
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:03,192
- The Bedoo, my wily Arabs.
- I've lost contact with my men too, sir.

350
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,880
- Oh, brew, sir?
- Treating them right? No!

351
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,992
- They think the world of me.
- They should be up here then.

352
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:12,669
- No brew.
- Bum on. On to Tripoli.

353
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:14,756
Uh...

354
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,916
- Come on.
- I was wondering, sir, a lift.

355
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,796
Sir... I...

356
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:26,636
Bum on. Bum on.

357
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:52,032
- Oh, it's gonna hurt, Flo.
- Damn, damn!

358
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:57,759
Get me another vehicle.
Come on, come on, come on.

359
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,192
- Ah!
- I'll take one of yours. Come on, come on!

360
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,958
- Come on, come on!
- Where've you been?

361
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,516
Get out. Come on, come on.

362
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,596
Get out.

363
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,915
Looking after their feet, are you, boy?
See they get plenty of tea.

364
00:26:17,040 --> 00:26:21,795
Curious thing, that, give the British soldier
plenty of tea, and he'll die for you.

365
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:26,111
Of course, I'm a poet.
I expect things. I love the desert.

366
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:30,518
You took me for an ignorant old fire-eater.
No. I'm sleeping with the desert.

367
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:35,792
Not unusual. Pat a white rump in the
desert and you'll startle an Englishman.

368
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:37,638
The Englishman loves the desert.

369
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,638
- You?
- I'm trying, sir.

370
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:45,675
Er, I play the piano. Not boasting.
Just a fact, that's all. Working class.

371
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:50,316
I think you should. Look after their feet,
boy. They can't be trusted with their feet.

372
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:53,830
Feet and brew-ups and you'll find
you can do anything with him.

373
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,919
Keep a tight rein on his habits.
Those of a pig, mostly.

374
00:26:58,040 --> 00:27:02,795
But even a pig has his moment. Carries
the blue ribbon. Don't despise your men.

375
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:05,798
They've given me a good life
so don't despise them. Here.

376
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:08,354
Share these out amongst them.

377
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:15,272
- Remember me, Grapple of the Bedoo.
- I won't bloody remember you.

378
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,349
- He used to be a fascist, sir.
- It takes all sorts.

379
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:24,439
Fascism is something you grow out of.
I tried to change the world myself.

380
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,712
Doesn't do. I wouldn't think anything
of you if you hadn't been a fascist.

381
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,593
Keep them at it
so they don't have time for dirty things.

382
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,712
Come on, young fella,
you've only got three more days.

383
00:27:34,840 --> 00:27:36,796
No time for poetry.

384
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,670
<i>(bugle)</i>

385
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:48,510
- There goes a very gallant gentleman.
- Oh, I know, sir, like you, sir.

386
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,110
Thank you, sir,
for not holding fascism against me.

387
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:57,234
I was a great mate of Mosley's. I held his
voice for him while he lost his meetings.

388
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:02,236
Hey, hey, I'd just like to say a few words.

389
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:11,112
Move, now.
I want to say how pleased I am...

390
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:16,116
How pleased I was

391
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:22,679
when I heard that I was going to lead you
on this dangerous and important task.

392
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:30,315
I've always thought that when the time
came, we'd all get on splendidly together.

393
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,670
Bravery, things like that.

394
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,155
<i>(yells)</i>

395
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:40,559
When I was told I was to be your troop
leader, I had a little weep and a laugh.

396
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:44,195
I do know we're all going
to get on splendidly together.

397
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,313
- You play ball with me...
- <i>(men)</i> And I'll play ball with you.

398
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:51,557
<i>(all)</i> You do your bit and I'll do mine.

399
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:53,910
We're all members of the same team,

400
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:59,592
each playing our part
in the fight for freedom and democracy.

401
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:07,308
Never surrender. Work hard. Train hard.
Play hard. And kill hard.

402
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,237
Don't take it too hard.

403
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:15,433
<i>(Grapple) Look after your lads. They're no</i>
<i>good to me if their feet aren't up to snuff.</i>

404
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,237
It hurts, Flo.

405
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:27,150
It is impossible to tell all the touching and
heroic stories of courage and patience...

406
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:31,478
- It hurts, Flo.
- Run them under the cold tap, love.

407
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,189
It is indeed a lovely sight.

408
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,073
Thank you, sir, it is my best part.

409
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,317
- Corporal of Musket!
- Can I put my shirt on now, sir?

410
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,991
Have you seen it?
It is indeed a lovely sight.

411
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,917
Corporal of Musket, look at it.

412
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:08,871
Will you be available for stag, sir?

413
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,551
If you will be taking your turn on guard,
I'd suggest first stag and me on last,

414
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:18,754
making sure you was fresh for command
on the off at the most likely times.

415
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:24,000
Pro tem, you can say no, I'll have you
down for mine being off at the first light.

416
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:26,270
Think we ought to green, green, green?

417
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,757
- Not unless you want bang, bang, bang.
- In the sky? Send up the Union Jack!

418
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,711
White and two reds...

419
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:36,435
That's very like the Colonel,
which reminds me...

420
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:40,951
If you do take a stag, sir, that's one hour
each, unless you keep the wireless open,

421
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:43,469
making the operator
unavailable for guard.

422
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,115
- That's me.
- Wireless silence, Corporal of Musket.

423
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,879
What have we got a wireless for, then?

424
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,632
We can't have wireless silence
without a wireless, can we, Spool?

425
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:57,796
Do come in, Corporal of Musket.

426
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:05,549
Of course I'll take my turn. That goes
without saying. Put me down for last stag.

427
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:09,195
- Gripweed.
- Sir?

428
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,356
Green, green, green.

429
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:15,758
Well, our officer calls me up and he says,
"Musketeer Gripweed..."

430
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,077
He was a tall chap.
Some would call him weedy. I did.

431
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,478
He said to me, and bear in mind we were
a few hundred miles behind enemy lines,

432
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,909
"Green, green, green" so I did.

433
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,949
<i>(shots)</i>

by a very gallant gentleman.

438
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:51,630
- I want to see all feet before we move.
- I think that was a mistake, sir.

439
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:58,039
Why, Corporal Dooley?
Have they been neglecting their feet?

440
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:01,357
- Have you?
- Get away from those vehicles.

00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,394
- Is this still North Africa?
- What?

446
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:49,033
Brew-up, sir?

447
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:53,239
You see why those lorries burnt so well
and exploded - nay, came apart -

448
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:57,035
that's petrol and lubricants,
which is very difficult to get in war.

449
00:34:57,160 --> 00:35:00,994
- Not for the British army. Or doctors.
- Right.

450
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:06,469
All we're getting on with now is casualties.
Report me casualties.

451
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,477
Ammo, water, petrol remaining.

452
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:13,116
One, have we got enough to get
to the oasis - which we will - is a point?

453
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,276
Two days, Corporal of Musket.

454
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:18,676
Two, dip for remaining fuel,
Corporal Dooley.

455
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,756
What's this?

456
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:26,793
That's a coward, sir.
We were bound to have one.

457
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,514
You can tell by the sweat
and the mess on his uniform.

458
00:35:29,640 --> 00:35:33,918
- Not a pretty sight, is he, sir?
- He's taking all his clothes off.

459
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,308
Now, stop this. That.

460
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:42,554
- Will you take my horse, sir?
- <i>(canned laughter)</i>

461
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:46,036
Take no large notice, sir.
He is working what is known as ticket.

462
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,593
It keeps the lads amused.

463
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:49,551
Pick those bits up, Gripweed.

464
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,877
- Where's your tin hat, Juniper?
- Losing by neglect, sir.

465
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,470
If I catch you without it again,
I'll ram it down your throat.

466
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,875
Losing one mess tin.

467
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,912
- Did you have your name on it?
- Scratched on.

468
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,634
- Pull these men together.
- Scratched on?

469
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:07,638
- Scored it.
- You disfigured government property?

470
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:11,594
Six days Royal Warrant.
March him off, Musket Major. Two men.

471
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,879
You ought to camouflage up, sir,
or get the scrim up if you're stopping.

472
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,913
Us in our vest are exposed
to all manner of nastiness.

473
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:25,237
I'm going to explode, but I won't.

474
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,430
I think the roller, don't you?

475
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:32,190
- Bayonet. Where's your bayonet?
- Must have left it sticking in the enemy.

476
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,550
- Where's your spur?
- Left it in the horse.

477
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:38,036
- Two men.
- <i>(canned laughter continues)</i>

478
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:45,675
- There, on the end of my finger.
- Finger?

479
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:49,713
- Musketeer Juniper, where's your finger?
- Left it up the Khyber Pass.

480
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:54,868
Self-inflicted injury.
March him off, Musket Major. Wait for it!

481
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,956
Two men.

482
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:04,073
I'm going away. I'm going
to walk a few paces backwards.

483
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:10,116
And I'm going to take a bearing,
out of earshot.

484
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:13,676
I am... right now.

485
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:19,511
Me. And when I get back,
I want that man in there out of there...

486
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,918
where I command from,
with all his clothes on.

487
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,271
And I want the roller
limbered up for moving.

488
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,914
With all his clothes on.

489
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:31,996
PDQ.

490
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:36,395
- That's a relief.
- That's a relief.

491
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:38,750
Excuse me, sir. Sorry, sir.

492
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,788
That's a relief.

493
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:44,876
Two men.

494
00:37:49,120 --> 00:37:51,076
Mount!

495
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,353
- It's for your own good, lad.
- Let me out.

496
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,436
Let me out.

497
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,069
- Will you put this on?
- No. Bloody let me out.

498
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:13,396
I wish I had 20 like you, Corporal Dooley.

499
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:19,799
Do you think you ought to go sick?

500
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:24,199
Driver, advance.

501
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:30,311
<i>(theme from "Lawrence Of Arabia")</i>

502

Get your cable out, Gripweed.
Get this half-track back.

503
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,155
Drogue, records
for the regimental magazine.

504
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:18,078
Right reverse. Come on.

505
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:21,715
Back, back, back, back. Right!

506
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,796
Come on, hitch it on.

507
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:32,309
Cable attached, Gripweed?
Right, forward.

508
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:43,279
Sorry, the gears look all alike.

509
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,156
Smile, please.

510
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,198
- That's a relief.
- That's a relief.

511
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,636
Dig the officer out.

- Brew-up, sir?
- I think so, yes.

514
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:56,271
Can you read a map, Corporal of Musket?

515
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:02,478
This is the Via Balbia.

516
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:05,239
Now, there is where...

517
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,239
There... we get our petrol from.

518
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:15,435
- We take it from a German petrol dump.
- Very good, sir.

519
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:19,678
That man, stand still.

520
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,117
- Clapper.
- Me?

521
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:25,595
You're improperly dressed.

522
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:32,398
- Best boots in for repair, sir?
- Do your button up, lad. You're idle.

523
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:35,876
- Oh, ta.
- Entertaining the troops.

524
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,279
My wife - large girl - works in a caff.
Biggest chips in the business.

525
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:44,838
There have been
too many unwounded prisoners taken.

526
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,236
Don't let it happen again.
Cut your throats next time.

527
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:52,990
Talking of throats, my wife. I took her
to the station to see the engines shunt.

528
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:57,318
Christmas, lovely girl, do you know
what she had in her stocking?

529
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,396
Legs, all the way up.

530
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,754
- He's mad.
- No, he's not, sir.

531
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,871
Working his ticket. It's inevitable.

532
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:10,869
You, when you find yourself surrounded
by the enemy with no hope of survival,

533
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:14,595
you must organise yourself
into a defensive locality and hold out.

534
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:15,596
I will.

535
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,349
By doing so, you will add enormously
to the enemy's difficulties.

536
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:22,836
I'd like to add to the enormous enemy...
I've never been a bother.

537
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:27,033
You will also save yourself spending
the rest of the war years in the bag.

538
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:33,998
I mean, the box. Prisoner-of-war camp.
Sitting there, going... <i>(repeated ticks)</i>

539
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:43,556
Let us go into the ring
in this, our first round,

540
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:48,993
with the light of battle in our eyes and
the strength of the righteous in our hearts.

541
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:51,429
- He's not mad.
- Yes, he is, sir.

542
00:42:51,560 --> 00:42:53,755
Keep the first three rows for the officers.

543
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:57,395
- Sir. Tea, sir? Thank you, sir, tea, sir.
- <i>(Juniper)</i> Take my wife.

544
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:03,470
You, the commanding officer! You look
as if you're suffering from bottle fatigue.

545
00:43:05,800 --> 00:43:08,598
- The man's mad, eh?
- No, he's not, sir.

546
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,917
Working his ticket.
Put him somewhere, he might cop one.

547
00:43:12,040 --> 00:43:15,555
- I want to fight.
- Good lad.

548
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:18,956
Is that a linear belt? It's very nice.

549
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:23,679
Yes, well. Put some clothes on
and we'll see, eh?

550
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,273
Ah! This damn sand.
When will it ever end?

551
00:43:32,200 --> 00:43:37,513
You see, the thing about fighting
a desert war is that it is a clean war.

552
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:42,714
Without brutality. Clean-limbed, without
dishonourable actions on either side.

553
00:43:42,840 --> 00:43:46,958
Number 18, concerning the weather.

554
00:43:47,080 --> 00:43:52,996
What wretched, filthy, glorious,
disappointing weather we are having.

555
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:58,919
And there are no civilians in the desert.
Except me. I'm a civilian.

556
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:04,153
But what am I then?

557
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:09,274
Well, try as I may, I can't see you
queuing for a number eight bus,

558
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:12,233
jingling your fourpence.

559
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,590
That's because I'm German.

560
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:17,396
<i>(speaking German)</i>

561
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,635
I think you are a civilian.

562
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,957
Yes, certainly I am.
Don't be put off by the clothes we wear.

563
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:31,275
We only wear these for fighting in.

564
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,870
I expect I've grown out
of my Harris tweeds by now.

565
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:38,913
Putting it that way, I think we all are.

566
00:44:39,040 --> 00:44:44,831
Yes, I think underneath
we are all blameless.

567
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:50,557
- Hey, Franz, you are a civilian.
- A civilian?

568
00:44:50,680 --> 00:44:54,593
"Thank Christ for that" he said,
laying down his rifle and going home,

569
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:59,191
so helping to perpetuate the dangerous
myth that soldiers don't like war.

570
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,276
Which they do.

571
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:10,957
It's a strange thought to think that this will
be the last world war fought by civilians.

572
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,957
I find it strange.

573
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,799
It'll make a nice change
to stick a bayonet into a chap

574
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:18,673
rather than a rotten old sandbag.

575
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,956
You'll be all right, lad.

576
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:28,309
I'm not going. Let him nick his own petrol.
I've got a young wife.

- <i>(discontent increases)</i>

579
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:39,878
There's lots of satisfaction
to be had out of the anticipation.

580
00:45:40,000 --> 00:45:45,199
There's lots of fun and letting off steam.
It's not all death.

581
00:45:45,320 --> 00:45:48,278
There's lots of fun to be had
out of other things as well.

582
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:51,153
Now, come on, let's take a look at you.

583

Can't let you down
with dirty nails, can we?

585
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:59,028
Right. Crews front. Get fell in.

586
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,116
<i>(shouting)</i>

587
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:07,873
- Don't say or tell them anything.
- My wife is young.

588
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,355
If you say anything, whisper,
so they won't know.

589
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:14,678
- Happy, shed a tear, entertained.
- I haven't got a wife yet. I've never done it.

590
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:20,477
I'll stick my bayonet up the jacksy of
the first who talks loud of love and wives

591
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,477
and children - I've got children.

592
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:26,195
I play the piano.
I'm not fighting this war for them.

593
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:30,472
Now, then, first one to look wonky
will get my boot up his dirtbox.

594
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:33,797
I die now in North Africa.
I've been crying, telling you.

595
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,310
Don't ask, don't threaten,
don't plead, keep it shut.

596
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,275
- I'm not a thief.
- Now, then, you're all clean for gangrene.

597
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:46,279
Don't loose me down. If we should be
stonked, get away from the vehicles.

598
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,153
I want to see you back here,
clean, bright and spent.

599
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:53,353
Keep it wrapped, don't do anything I
wouldn't. There's transport if you want it.

600
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:56,074
If you're picked up,
tell them you're a Guardsman.

601
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,760
Hands out of your pockets.
Top hats will not be worn.

602
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,989
No fish and chips in uniform.
Parade... Parade, turn.

603
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:14,790
- Parade ready for your inspection, sir.
- Thank you, Corporal of Musket.

604
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:20,958
- Musketeer Drogue, isn't it?
- I'd like you to have my blessing.

605
00:47:21,080 --> 00:47:24,914
Don't worry too much. Very good turnout.

606
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:28,112
There's been marvellous advances
in surgery, thanks to war.

607
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:31,869
- Well done, Musketeer Drogue. Black up.
- <i>(quacks)</i>

608
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,718
You can't make me fight.

609
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,595
No, but we can put you where your
decision might prove fatal. Pieces of jam.

610
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,597
Right, mount.

611
00:47:42,280 --> 00:47:47,035
I don't know your name
but I'd like you to have my camera.

612
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:53,518
Orders, information enemy, nil.
Information own troops. We are...

613
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:59,351
<i>(all) Third Troop of the Fourth Muskets</i>
<i>acting in an independent role as infantry,</i>

614
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:04,031
<i>lorried behind the enemy lines</i>
<i>with sports equipment.</i>

615
00:48:25,200 --> 00:48:26,792
<i>(Goodbody) Intention.</i>

616
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,435
<i>(all) We shall, under cover of darkness,</i>

617
00:48:30,560 --> 00:48:36,351
<i>occupy a position</i>
<i>overlooking the enemy encampment.</i>

618
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:44,034
<i>We will then attack</i>
<i>and destroy the enemy for his petrol.</i>

619
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:49,318
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with G.

620
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:58,352
Method. Corporal Dooley, with one LMG,
will move forward to high ground

621
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,596
at 1.00 o'clock from my present position.

622
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,314
<i>(all) The rest of the troop,</i>
<i>under my command,</i>

623
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:09,675
<i>will crawl to a point - figures -</i>
<i>100 yards in front of the objective</i>

624
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:14,032
<i>where they will wait for the LMG</i>
<i>to get into position.</i>

625
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:20,269
<i>The signal for the LMG to open fire</i>
<i>shall be green, green, green.</i>

626
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,076
<i>The LMG shall cease firing</i>
<i>when the main attack is mounted</i>

627
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:30,433
<i>and is within - figures -</i>
<i>50 yards of the objective.</i>

628
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:35,588
<i>We will consolidate on the objective.</i>
<i>We shall not take prisoners.</i>

629
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:38,917
If we pull together,
with true British pluck and team spirit,

630
00:49:39,040 --> 00:49:43,158
we shall, with the help
of the Almighty God of battles,

631
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:46,033
win his just victory
over the forces of evil.

632
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:49,709
Good luck. I'm a little duck
so let's get quacking into battle.

633
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:51,432
- Come on.
- Eh?

634
00:49:51,560 --> 00:49:54,552
Who's the Almighty God of battles?
Jesus, is it?

635
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,513
That's right. It will be. Jesus.

636
00:49:57,640 --> 00:50:00,791
Clapper, I'd like you to have my watch.

637
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:33,676
<i>(shouting in German)</i>

638
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:27,877
Command, forward!

639
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,392
Come on! Come on!

640
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:46,753
Forward!

641
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:48,552
<i>(Goodbody)</i> Follow me!

642
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:04,954
<i>(speaking German)</i>

643
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:27,357
<i>(shouting in German)</i>

644
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:03,071
Where are you going, lad?
Why don't you make the best of it?

645
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,317
It can be fun. Some have
the best of their life in the army.

646
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:09,113
<i>(screaming/canned laughter)</i>

647
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:52,630
A rout! A disgraceful rout.

648
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:56,878
Get fell in. Let's see your bayonets.
Have them out, have them out.

649
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,958
Why are you laughing, Drogue?
Wipe that smile off your face.

650
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,230
Let's see 'em, at the end of your hype -

651
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,999
not waving about
like a hampton searching for a hand.

652
00:54:05,120 --> 00:54:08,715
What do we wear in our caps?
Does it need cleaning, Juniper?

653
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,308
- Yes, it does.
- Look at them all, shining bright.

654
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:15,877
Fancy me fighting filthy like that.
An old chubby duster like me.

655
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:20,551
Might have got gangrene from that.
I'll have it out with my servant.

656
00:54:20,680 --> 00:54:24,878
Filthy! Get a tube, siphon petrol from
the gin palace and fill up the half-track.

657
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:28,276
- That's you out of mischief.
- Look at them all, shining bright.

658
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:32,029
- I want them stinking.
- Corporal of Musket.

659
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,036
Condensed milk.

660
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:40,829
About all you're good for,
sticking it in tins.

661
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:46,159
Your badge represents the regiment
and the regiment represents all of us.

662
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:49,078
You, me, all of us here today.

663
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,317
- A dirty badge is a disgrace.
- They shouldn't be clean.

664
00:54:52,440 --> 00:54:55,159
Shining bright? Two days,
for having a dirty bayonet.

665
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,558
- They shouldn't be clean.
- They should be sticky with blood.

666
00:54:59,680 --> 00:55:01,432
What did you return with?

667
00:55:01,560 --> 00:55:03,755
- I got some pretty things.
- No, no.

668
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,792
I want to see you coming back
on the high port, grinning.

669
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:09,832
With blood running down arms,
dripping from elbows.

670
00:55:09,960 --> 00:55:12,758
I don't care whose blood it is.
Stick it in your mate.

671
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:16,395
Let's have it used. I hate waste.

672
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,512
See. See mine.

673
00:55:22,120 --> 00:55:26,079
It represents your father,
mine, his before that.

674
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:29,112
It represents battles
fought and won years ago.

675
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:31,834
Battles fought so that we could live
as we wanted to,

676
00:55:31,960 --> 00:55:34,474
long before the Americans
were even thought of.

677
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:39,276
They didn't invent living, you know.
It represents tradition, Musketeer.

678
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,551
And I for one won't stand
for a dirty tradition.

679
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:44,352
Get the nonsense out of them.

680
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:47,790
I tried to get you interested.
You'll have to learn the hard way.

681
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:50,070
Squad, 'shun!

682
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:52,156
High port.

683
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,475
At the throat, point in!

684
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,194
Out! En garde. Shout it, Clapper.

685
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:01,279
- In, out, en garde!
- Let's hear from you.

686
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:03,868
Can I see you
for a moment, personal, sir?

687
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:06,912
- What?
- It's the butcher this time, sir.

688
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:09,998
With his steak and his mutton.
She'll do anything for extra.

689
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:13,317
<i>(soldiers) Left nipple, right groin</i>/

690
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,715
<i>Left nipple, right groin</i>/

691
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:20,038
Is it now the butcher which is carrying out
intimacy at your home address?

692
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,232
- <i>(all)</i> In, out, <i>en garde.</i>
- Is it right, sir?

693
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:25,954
- Is it right a butcher should...
- <i>(all)</i> Whip it out!

694
00:56:26,080 --> 00:56:29,277
- <i>(all)</i> Whip it in!
...while her husband is away fighting?

695
00:56:29,400 --> 00:56:32,995
- <i>(all)</i> And wipe it.
- At the throat, jab. Shout it, Clapper.

696
00:56:33,120 --> 00:56:35,714
At the throat, jab!

697
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:39,435
At the throat, jab! At the throat, jab!

698
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:42,757
- Kill him. Kill the bleeder.
- At the throat, Gripweed!

699
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:46,668
- How's this for openers?
- <i>(engine)</i>

700
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,791
Now, watch closely.

701
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:56,948
I am about to demonstrate the correct use
of the identification triangle.

702
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:03,118
Oblique, middle and near east.
Oblique, yellow.

703
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:08,354
Each platoon, troop or tactical unit

704
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:12,314
will detail one man
to carry the triangle at all times.

705
00:57:12,440 --> 00:57:17,719
Now watch closely, Clapper, because
in future you will be the triangle man.

706
00:57:18,680 --> 00:57:23,800
But any one of you might be called upon
to be conversant with the triangle.

707
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,434
So watch closely.
You won't get another chance.

708
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:30,678
It is tied under the chin, like so.

709
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:33,439
On the approach of a friendly aircraft,

710
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:39,829
the bearer stands in a prominent position
and displays the triangle thus.

711
00:57:42,800 --> 00:57:45,439
- Where's the roller gone?
- <i>(machine gun)</i>

712
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:49,029
Gripweed, have you stolen the roller?

713
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:57,870
Where's that roller gone?

714
00:57:58,320 --> 00:58:00,675
This is the last straw.

715
00:58:02,280 --> 00:58:06,990
That is it. No one move from this spot.

716
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:12,148
There'll be no more leave, late-night
passes until that roller is returned.

717
00:58:12,280 --> 00:58:15,875
I get you all clean, fit,
ready for fighting and what do you do?

718
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:20,755
There'll be no more privileges.
I'll stop this petty thieving.

719
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:25,428
And, Gripweed, what's more,
who's had my Brylcreem?

720
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:28,279
- You?
- Never touch the stuff, I'm excused hair.

721
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:37,110
There! Italian recreation eyeties!
You can't put a bloody thing down.

722
00:58:37,240 --> 00:58:40,437
There is a code, you know. Scavengers.

723
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:54,794
Sticks in my craw. I can take most things
but stealing I draw the line at.

724
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,757
Here we are, fighting
the most desperate war in history,

725
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:01,394
and a few wop adventurers
act the giddy goat.

726
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:04,956
I've seen your sort fumigated.
If a wop can be fumigated.

727
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:07,594
To think they once handed out
ice cream wafers.

728
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:11,235
To think you once handed out
cornets on a Sunday afternoon.

729
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:16,832
Is there no damn decency left in you?
No respect for the property of others?

730
00:59:16,960 --> 00:59:20,669
Play your ridiculous game but don't
expect us to take any notice of you.

731
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,712
Grown men in shorts! I'm pretty incensed.

732
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:26,308
It's one of the most shocking things
in the war.

733
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:30,115
It's a shame the Italian nation
has to be brought into disrepute

734
00:59:30,240 --> 00:59:34,711
by the lunatic actions
of a pitiful few fascist pimps.

735
00:59:34,840 --> 00:59:37,274
And let that be a lesson to you!

736
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,870
<i>(engine cuts out)</i>

737
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:15,310
Well done! Oh, very well done!

<i>- (cheering)</i>
<i>- Italia</i>/

739
01:00:18,080 --> 01:00:22,471
The tide is turning.
Our very first real victory.

740
01:00:22,600 --> 01:00:26,639
The beginning of the end for the Boche.
I think the tide is turning. I do!

741
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:28,990
You got him, Tranners! I do!

742
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:34,799
- Wasn't he one of ours?
- Here's one of mine.

743
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:38,230
- Go on, get him.
- Let that be a lesson to you.

744
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:41,796
- Shoot your own officers.
- You can't leave a thing lying around.

745
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:46,755
There's nobody to be trusted in total war.
Well done, though.

746
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:53,228
Our first real victory. The writing
on the wall. We're coming back, Adolf.

747
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:55,157
The tide has turned.

748
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:58,477
Come on, Gripweed. The army didn't
bring you to admire the view.

749
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,239
There's a job to be done
and precious little time.

750
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:05,273
You two check for damage.
Juniper, put that petrol in the half-track.

751
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:08,915
Empty your water bottles into the roller.
We need the weight.

752
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:11,110
Come on, Clapper, stop daydreaming.

753
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:15,358
Tell the wife to drop the butcher and
become a vegetarian. That's my advice.

754
01:01:15,480 --> 01:01:19,155
Thank you, sir. Thank you,
you've saved my life again, sir.

755
01:01:19,280 --> 01:01:22,590
Then he won't be round
tempting her with his buckshee mutton.

756
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:26,998
Bloody waste of time. Soft git.

757
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:33,874
I know it's a long way.
I know it's not glamorous as a job.

758
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,596
I know there are others doing jobs
in this war that are more glamorous.

759
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:41,678
But I had this promise.

760
01:01:41,800 --> 01:01:46,794
Some soldiers are going to come out of
the din of battle and are going to thank us.

761
01:01:47,640 --> 01:01:52,714
If we can get our very small cricket pitch
by first light tomorrow morning.

762
01:01:52,840 --> 01:01:55,115
Another 20 miles, that's all.

763
01:01:55,240 --> 01:01:57,435
If we can,

764
01:01:57,560 --> 01:02:00,438
they're going to look
at our small patch of sanity

765
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:03,552
and they're going to say it was worth it.

766
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:08,708
They are, and then we...
I have this promise.

767
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:11,832
We can go and do stirring things.

768
01:02:11,960 --> 01:02:13,916
Bloody waste of...

769
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:26,360
I'll stop this petty thieving.

770
01:02:42,200 --> 01:02:44,156
Petty thieving!

771
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,112
Do you get much thievery,
cowardice, things like that?

772
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,196
No, no.

773
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:55,749
Being in improper possession
of a comrade's property.

774
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:58,997
- Can't put a thing down.
- No.

775
01:02:59,120 --> 01:03:02,874
On the whole, no thievery, no fibbing,
no arguing with a superior officer,

776
01:03:03,000 --> 01:03:05,673
no treachery, no cowardice,
not much rape.

777
01:03:05,800 --> 01:03:10,476
I don't countenance rape.
No letting down of the boys.

778
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,512
They'll have to put all that back.

779
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:16,108
Most of us are artists.

780
01:03:18,440 --> 01:03:20,396
Ah! He's very good.

781
01:03:23,720 --> 01:03:28,236
Ah, look, they're going
to blow up your geraniums.

782
01:03:28,360 --> 01:03:29,588
Oh, dear.

That's a relief.

01:04:20,000 --> 01:04:23,754
What's so damned important
about a damned cricket pitch?

786
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,509
I said, more to show
that though I was an officer,

787
01:04:27,640 --> 01:04:31,349
I could understand the feelings
of ordinary chaps like them.

788
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:35,712
- But it isn't just a cricket pitch, is it?
- It is.

789
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:42,598
I'll tell you for why. Because it's
a silly bloody silly cricket pitch is why.

790
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:46,269
On. We'll find the bloody oasis ourselves.

about the second battle of Alamein again.

It's high time.

You're a great man, a very great man,
but you are impatient.

- That is the way to lose battles.

- I want a battle.
- I'll tell you the sort of man I am.

810
01:06:12,320 --> 01:06:17,314
I am patient. At the second battle
of Alamein, I shall be patient.

811
01:06:17,440 --> 01:06:20,557
I shall start the battle... here.

812
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,910
And then I shall go to bed... there.

813

That is the sort of man I am.
Never fight battles when you're awake.

We're fighting against men
inflicted with a terrible virus.

Do push-ups. Clapper, on your belly.
And it is a belly. I want you fit.

300 tanks, 200 aeroplanes.

I'll tell you my plan.
I hatched it in the lavatory.

825
01:07:26,640 --> 01:07:28,995
My plans are
always hatched in lavatories.

826
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:32,032
Pull the bleeding chain, then.

- Spool, no. Have some pride, lad.

- Who took the water?

829
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,752
Spool, I'm talking to you, lad.
I can shoot you.

830
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:50,553
A hole in your head.
You'll die with your silly name.

831
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:55,196
- I let it out so it would be lighter.
- Shoot me, in my big toe.

832
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:58,949
I can, you know, shoot you, and him.

833
01:07:59,080 --> 01:08:02,436
And you can, him.
Put a round up him. All it needs.

834
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:05,472
Come on, come on. Running on the spot.

835

Begin! One, two, one, two...

836
01:08:09,680 --> 01:08:12,353
- Go on, Gripweed.
- I can't, Tranny.

837
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,631
Yes, you can. It's easy.

838
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:22,632
It gets easier. That's the thing about it.
The thing I hate more than anything else.

839
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:26,273
I'm not going to be able
to go home, you know.

840
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:31,997
A lad I know saved a grenade at Dunkirk.
Didn't drop it in the sandbag.

841
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,954
Saved it, took it home
and put in on his stomach,

842
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:38,913
holding it between belly and thigh,
and went to bed.

843
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,190
Pin out, relaxed and died.

844
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:44,396
It gets very easy.

845
01:08:46,160 --> 01:08:51,188
I can look at a man, dead, step over him
ten times a day, going to the cookhouse.

846
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:55,393
Not curious enough
to turn him over and see his face.

847
01:08:55,520 --> 01:08:58,671
Front lying... down!

848
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:01,916
I do blame them for that.

849
01:09:03,280 --> 01:09:05,236
This way, sir.

850
01:09:06,480 --> 01:09:08,436
I do blame them for that.

851
01:09:10,280 --> 01:09:15,354
I used to be put off my supper should
I see a cat dead in the middle of the road.

852
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:21,510
Or a bird, leave alone a man, though
we didn't get much of that down our way.

853
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,914
- So you can.
- I won't, though.

854
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:31,750
- That's different, won't.
- This beats National Socialism, Gripweed!

855
01:09:31,880 --> 01:09:33,472
I am glad I won't.

856
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:36,717
Don't move, sir, we're all in a minefield.

857
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:44,993
It's a very simple plan.
All my plans are simple plans.

858
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,396
Look at Dieppe. That was simple.

859
01:09:48,520 --> 01:09:51,557
Wait until Arnhem.
That's going to be simple.

860
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,433
Gather your ammunition.
Leave your packs by the roller.

861
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:57,836
- And have them whipped?
- No, Gripweed is coming with us.

862
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,077
I'm simple. Gather round me.
Can you hear me at the back?

863
01:10:01,200 --> 01:10:02,952
- Hi-de-hi!
- Ho-de-ho!

864
01:10:03,080 --> 01:10:05,435
Has he sent you any water, has he?

865
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:09,599
That man. Corporal of Musket,
stop that man making an ass of himself.

866
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:13,679
Get all 500 guns and fire them in the same
place to blow the daylights out of them.

867
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:16,712
- Hold still, Spool.
- Fill your bottles from the roller.

868
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:20,469
- Give him a drink, Corporal of Musket.
- There's none in there.

869
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:24,479
- My God, the roller. Get it in the shade.
- I thought it would be lighter.

870
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:29,799
Come on, lad. We'll get some water when
we capture the oasis. Lashings of water.

871
01:10:29,920 --> 01:10:33,435
We'll send you chaps in
with 200 tanks going like bats out of hell.

872
01:10:33,560 --> 01:10:37,030
You've seen enough now. Off you go,
there's good chaps. Hold his head.

873
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:42,029
Just who could play a trick like that?
At the best, it's rank inefficiency.

874
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:44,958
- Me!
- Who took my man's water? I want water.

875
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,435
- How can my men fight without water?
- Me!

876
01:10:47,560 --> 01:10:50,472
I did, I let the bloody water out
to make it lighter.

877
01:10:50,600 --> 01:10:53,194
Give the lad some room, will you?

878
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:56,357
Would you take that camera away?
There's a good fella.

879
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,313
Haven't you had enough?
Find a battle and film it.

880
01:10:59,440 --> 01:11:02,238
- <i>(Juniper)</i> A good battle.
- Clear these cameramen away.

881
01:11:02,360 --> 01:11:06,638
Haven't you insulted us enough? Your
army is the best in the world. Get away.

882
01:11:06,760 --> 01:11:08,990
It's all right. Don't let him bite this time.

883
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:13,079
- It's all over. Make a ring round him.
- No, let the bastards see.

884
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,953
No. The next of kin, think of them.

885
01:11:16,080 --> 01:11:17,672
<i>(Spool screams)</i>

886
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:21,713
That happened to a son of mine.
He was left all through the war.

887
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,593
- They do, don't they?
- With his eardrum.

888
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:28,633
- It's the noise, I expect.
- Still, he's not dead like some.

889
01:11:28,760 --> 01:11:33,834
- Well, you can forgive.
- Missing. Not dead. They didn't get him.

890
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:36,679
He'll turn up. Missing, he is.

891
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:39,630
<i>(bugle)</i>

892
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,797
Colonel! Colonel, any water?

893
01:11:46,920 --> 01:11:49,275
Bum on, bum on, on to Tunis.

894
01:11:49,400 --> 01:11:52,392
See to the roller... and Spool first.

895
01:11:52,520 --> 01:11:57,674
Huzzah! It'll be all right now.
Huzzah! Good old Colonel Grapple.

896
01:11:57,800 --> 01:12:01,588
He's a character that will see us through.
That's the thing about war.

897
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:05,759
It's a picnic if left to the right officers.
Men who understand our ways.

898
01:12:05,880 --> 01:12:09,395
Treat us like human beings.
What we want is more humane killers.

899
01:12:09,520 --> 01:12:13,593
Good old Colonel Grapple! See you on
personal when you have a moment, sir?

900
01:12:16,720 --> 01:12:18,278
<i>(all) Achtung</i>/

901
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:21,756
My God! No time for that now.
They must know we're here.

902
01:12:21,880 --> 01:12:24,030
- Rounds per man?
- Three and a half, sir.

903
01:12:24,160 --> 01:12:26,116
When you use that, fix bayonets and die.

904
01:12:26,240 --> 01:12:28,913
Charge is the joke.
Fix bayonets and charge.

905
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:32,316
- We're all gonna die under funny names.
- Charge.

906
01:12:32,440 --> 01:12:35,238
Good luck to you all. Tally-ho!

907
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,874
Boot the Hun right through to Tunis!

908
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:39,956
<i>(repeatedly)</i> Fire!

909

<i>(bagpipes)</i>

910
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:07,912
Now, bear in mind,
we had him on the run, Jerry.

911
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:10,156
We'd stood to all night, of course.

912
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:13,716
As we stood up, the bullets
flew around us. Like rain it was.

913
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:17,230
I well remember - and bear in mind,
I was platoon sergeant -

914
01:13:17,360 --> 01:13:20,033
it therefore was behove of me
to keep morale up -

915
01:13:20,160 --> 01:13:22,879
so I said, more as a laugh,

916
01:13:23,000 --> 01:13:25,514
cos it wasn't tense or below par...

917
01:13:25,640 --> 01:13:27,676
You very rarely are, at the start line.

918
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:32,715
Take no notice of the Yanks. They haven't
lived. And they was always bombing us.

919
01:13:32,840 --> 01:13:37,197
Now there's rarely any tenseness.
It's the relaxation you notices.

920
01:13:37,320 --> 01:13:43,111
Little kips all along the start line,
barring them as is already haywire.

921
01:13:43,240 --> 01:13:46,391
So... more to raise a laugh...

922
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:54,913
Like shoelaces, seeing as they're tight.
Not crippling you, not causing you to trip.

923
01:13:56,040 --> 01:13:58,031
There. <i>(he laughs)</i>

924
01:13:58,160 --> 01:14:04,474
Silly ha'porth! Crippled you. It's important
to raise a laugh on the battlefield.

925
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,388
And very humorous the laughs can be.
Some humorous books being written.

926
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:14,231
More for a laugh, I said "We should have
us gas capes on. It is raining bullets."

927
01:14:14,360 --> 01:14:16,999
That was when we lost Charles Black
from a raindrop.

928
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:21,955
I said "We should have us umbrellas
and gas capes, boys. Raining bullets."

929
01:14:22,080 --> 01:14:25,356
"We'll get wet, boys,
if we're not careful, chums" I said.

930
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,436
More for a laugh.

931
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,190
<i>(whistles "Colonel Bogey")</i>

932
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:43,872
Well, you see? Good.

933
01:15:44,520 --> 01:15:46,476
<i>(speaks German)</i>

934
01:15:57,000 --> 01:15:58,956
<i>Wollen Sie trinken?</i>

01:16:00,640 --> 01:16:02,596
<i>(shouting in German)</i>

<i>(groaning)</i>

937
01:16:28,680 --> 01:16:30,636
Oh, my poor horses.

938
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:36,350
Cavalry horses love the stir and the din,
even the danger, of battle.

939
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,677
The British cavalryman
regards his horse as his friend.

940
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:45,033
Those who have ponies,
children and horses of your own, at home,

941
01:16:45,160 --> 01:16:47,720
may like to know how well
we look after our steeds.

942
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:53,790
Sometimes we risk being shot at to put
our wounded mounts out of their misery.

943

<i>(gunshot, man yelps)</i>

944

Eight, nine... How's your leg theory,
Corporal of Musket?

945
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:04,990
I'd like your opinion. What do you think?

946
01:17:05,120 --> 01:17:08,829
As a wicket, likely to vent spiteful
by midday, I think.

947
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:10,837
Er... Light roller.

948
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:16,114
Bowlers don't expect miracles.
As a pitch, it will teach you perseverance.

949
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:18,390
21, 22...

950
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:21,273
I want a batting crease
four feet from here, Gripweed.

951
01:17:21,400 --> 01:17:24,153
Spool, put a stump in here.

952
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:28,759
The light should be good.
Keep the water off, I think.

953
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:33,158
Don't want to have to contend
with a sticky wicket.

954
01:17:34,480 --> 01:17:37,313
On a dead wicket, always bat first.

955
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:44,040
Remember, Gripweed, medals are merely
milestones on the road to final victory.

956
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,799
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

957
01:18:05,120 --> 01:18:06,872

- In enemy hands, sir.

960
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:50,435
You told them nothing
but name, rank and number?

961
01:18:50,560 --> 01:18:52,869
I don't know my name, rank and number.

962
01:18:53,000 --> 01:18:55,798
I remember the number of my first rifle.
Don't try that.

963
01:18:55,920 --> 01:19:00,152
I can smell them, the ones who are not
100 per cent for it. Try that one on me?

964
01:19:00,280 --> 01:19:04,876
Take those nasty Nazi clothes off
and play cricket. Teach you team spirit.

965
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:07,878
Not a wound on him.
Show me a wound.

966
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,719
You stink of surrender.
Not a decent wound on you.

967
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:14,389
- I've been burned.
- We've all been burned.

968
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,870
Pads on! Play every ball on its merit.

969
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:23,391
- I want to fight.
- That man is malingering.

970
01:19:25,280 --> 01:19:30,035
I've a damn shrewd idea
that you are trying to work your ticket.

971
01:19:32,240 --> 01:19:35,073
I say, you can't do that.
He's a private soldier.

972
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,634
He's a stinking coward.

973
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,992
I've always wanted to hit a general.

974
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:46,078
Fall in, two men, he hit the General.

975
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:51,991
- Open the batting from the mountain end.
- What's going on here?

976
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:58,953
That boy is only 19. Here, hold this camel.
Hit somebody your own rank, or near it.

977
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:02,356
- Who are you?
- Grapple MC. Grapple of the Bedoo.

978
01:20:02,480 --> 01:20:05,870
And another thing, I will not play cricket...

979
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:09,436
- Come, now, none of us like war.
- I do. I like war.

980
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,154
I do not like cricket.

981
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:18,238
- Did you have many humorous incidents?
- Yes, we did.

982
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:22,194
- Tell me about yours.
- They're not funny, really.

983
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:26,711
- Tell me. Are the British cruel?
- Oh, yes.

984
01:20:26,840 --> 01:20:31,072
- We know what we're doing.
- And we are.

985
01:20:31,200 --> 01:20:35,193
Do you know what we have done
to millions of people?

986
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:40,633
- I think you've killed them.
- I don't know anything about it. Terrible.

987
01:20:40,760 --> 01:20:44,594
- Are you sorry about these people?
- No, no, I am not.

988
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:47,757
I thought about it and... no, I'm not.

989
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:50,830
I'm not sorry about my men.

990
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:53,474
- Did you have a lot of men?
- Yes.

991
01:20:53,600 --> 01:20:56,160
- You did?
- Yes, hundreds.

992
01:20:57,120 --> 01:21:01,511
Me too, and all with the same faces.
They all looked the same to me.

993
01:21:01,640 --> 01:21:05,349
You look after them, see their feet
is clean, dry, powdered.

994
01:21:05,480 --> 01:21:10,395
- They will not look after their feet.
- They began to kill me with worry.

995
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,670
More than that. More.

996
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:16,596
May I?

997
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:21,876
The thing about them
was they would not respond.

998
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:24,992
There it was for them,
a crusade against tyranny...

999
01:21:25,120 --> 01:21:28,032
Oh, not you. Not you.

1000
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:32,833
But if they knew the King.
My mother knew him well.

1001
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:34,632
She used to send to his birthday.

1002
01:21:34,760 --> 01:21:38,116
And all the children, the princesses,
they all got something,

1003
01:21:38,240 --> 01:21:41,073
even though
we were not that well off.

1004
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,714
I wanted to do my best for him.

1005
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:47,515
He knew
why he gave me his commission.

1006
01:21:47,640 --> 01:21:50,234
- You know what I mean?
- <i>Ja.</i>

1007
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:54,514
I wanted to know them.

1008
01:21:54,640 --> 01:21:57,200
I wanted to know them very much.

1009
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:03,678
I can talk to you.
I could talk to nobody else.

1010
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:09,635
I haven't spoken to anyone else about
the King and me for the whole of this...

1011
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:12,752
And I. The King and I. You know?

1012
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,315
- You'd like him.
- Thank you.

1013
01:22:18,440 --> 01:22:23,753
As I was saying, I haven't been
able to speak to anyone else

1014
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:26,678
through the whole of this film.

1015
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:32,636
You see, one day, after a not particularly
arduous or expensive skirmish,

1016
01:22:32,760 --> 01:22:35,797
they were all gathered round me...

1017
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,717
I well remember...

1018
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:44,837
the way an admirable man and a great
soldier referred to expensive noises

1019
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:48,509
as he listened to a battle without emotion.

1020
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,710
That is the way, isn't it?

1021
01:22:51,840 --> 01:22:55,549
- For our kind.
- You are a fascist!

1022
01:22:56,360 --> 01:23:00,717
Am I? But I don't particularly dislike Jews.

1023
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:04,549
- I love them.
- Have you...? Are you cruel?

1024
01:23:04,680 --> 01:23:09,549
- Have you killed many Jews?
- Quite a lot.

1025
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:13,116
- What do you say to that?
- Good Lord.

1026
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:16,312
But then I try to find good in everybody.

1027
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:22,956
<i>(sparse applause)</i>

01:23:31,680 --> 01:23:33,716
You're the only one decently turned out.

01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,791
This man is not fit to plead.

1032
01:23:39,920 --> 01:23:43,037
It is obvious to anyone
with a spark of humanity in them

1033
01:23:43,160 --> 01:23:46,835
that he should be treated with sympathy
and understanding and sent home.

1034
01:23:46,960 --> 01:23:51,795
- Shut up! You may not say anything.
- Defending officer, sir.

1035
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:55,310
He's not an officer,
for all his voice and his linear belt.

1036
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:59,592
Therefore, he may not make speeches.
He has no privileges in this court.

1037
01:23:59,720 --> 01:24:02,598
Choose anyone you like
but only officers can talk to me.

1038
01:24:02,720 --> 01:24:05,996
That makes it awkward.
He should have gone to grammar school.

1039
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:10,238
- Got his Cert A, passed his commission,
- I came up from the ranks. I'm a general.

1040
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:12,874
- This is a general court martial.
- For hitting me.

1041
01:24:13,000 --> 01:24:14,513
- Permission to speak.
- Shut up.

1042
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:16,039
Speak up. Be respectful.

1043
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:19,789
What is wrong with the army
is that there is not enough humanity in it.

1044
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:24,596
Shut up! If it wasn't for the British army,
you wouldn't be here today.

1045
01:24:24,720 --> 01:24:26,676
Humanity!

1046
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:29,357
We're going into Germany soon.

1047
01:24:29,480 --> 01:24:33,075
When we get to the home of the Hun,
take your pips off.

1048
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:34,758
You're a very lucky chap.

1049
01:24:34,880 --> 01:24:39,158
You're fighting in a war which may well
turn out to be a crusade. If I know the Hun.

1050
01:24:39,280 --> 01:24:44,195
A good soldier but a bit frightful. With
any luck, he's up to some revolting things.

1051
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:46,788
In case he isn't, better take your pips off.

1052
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,549
They will put a bullet through your neck
for what you've made them do.

1053
01:24:51,680 --> 01:24:54,513
I don't think Jerry will disappoint us,
so shut up!

1054
01:24:54,640 --> 01:25:00,237
I don't think I could do that. They're the
nicest things that ever happened to me.

1055
01:25:00,360 --> 01:25:03,955
I think my lads are very fond of me.

1056
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:07,072
Sir! Permission to fall out, sir?

1057
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:10,715
We've been playing cricket
in the hot sun for three hours.

1058
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:14,753
We can't enjoy ourselves infinitum,
or at least bowl underarm.

1059
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,953
Play on is my advice to you unless
you want to look at me in a court martial.

1060
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:21,992
- Enjoy yourselves. It will be a long war.
- Play on!

1061
01:25:22,120 --> 01:25:26,477
You may not fall out until a very important
bod sees you entertained and happy.

1062
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:30,752
Tails up, I haven't brought you
all this way to bowl underarm.

1063
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:34,509
- It's just as hard for me as it is for you.
- You're a bastard.

1064
01:25:34,640 --> 01:25:37,757
I hope so, I hope I am a bastard.

1065
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:40,599
- I'm not proud of it.
- Sit down, son.

1066
01:25:40,720 --> 01:25:44,429
I've looked after their feet
as if they were my own, sir.

1067
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:46,152
Excuse me, sir.

1068
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,713
- What is all this?
- Advance cricket pitch.

1069
01:26:02,840 --> 01:26:05,912
Present and ready for your inspection, sir.

1070
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:11,390
What rotten bowlers. Right, drive on.

1071
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:16,355
It is bad. The lower-middle and working
classes receiving the King's Commission?

1072
01:26:16,480 --> 01:26:20,553
These classes, unlike like the classes
who led the army when I was a lad,

1073
01:26:20,680 --> 01:26:23,433
never had their people to consider.

1074
01:26:29,160 --> 01:26:31,355
I liked it better when he was a comedian.

1075
01:26:31,480 --> 01:26:33,948
He wasn't very funny but I liked it better.

1076
01:26:34,080 --> 01:26:37,516
Jokes. Mind you, I'm working class.

1077
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:40,473
I had a grandfather who was a miner.

1078
01:26:40,600 --> 01:26:42,636
Until he sold it.

1079
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:45,320
It's a very simple plan.
All my plans are simple.

1080
01:26:45,440 --> 01:26:49,831
You remember Dieppe? Arnhem will be
as simple. A few parachutes, that's all.

1081
01:27:06,920 --> 01:27:09,559
My heart's not in it any more.

1082
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:13,673
Oh, go away, I'm tired. I'm the only
bleeding bowler in the Second Army.

1083
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:16,234
<i>(artillery and machine guns)</i>

- It's all right, sir. I'm very grateful.

1086
01:27:42,280 --> 01:27:46,114
- Stretcher bearer!
- Jammy bastard.

1087
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:56,151
With the Second Army linking up, the men
of the Airborne can afford to relax a little.

1088
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:03,430

1094
01:28:50,160 --> 01:28:52,515
One, two...

01:28:52,640 --> 01:28:54,995
Don't look, don't look, don't look!

1096

Don't look.

1098
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:10,874
Don't look...

Come on.

1100
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,513
Dooley, Spool, take the barn.

1101
01:29:28,640 --> 01:29:30,790
Sergeant Transom with me.

1102
01:29:45,040 --> 01:29:46,996
We are English.

1103
01:29:54,960 --> 01:29:56,678
Nice place you've got.

1104
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:05,874
Right, you two, outside. Slit trench eight
yards from this wall. Move yourselves.

1105
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:07,672
Do sit down.

1106
01:30:14,800 --> 01:30:19,316
<i>(announcer)</i> Now, this is the job on which
the soldier's life and the battle depends.

1107
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:22,352
As soon as the infantryman
reaches a new position,

1108
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:25,631
he starts to dig in with pick and spade.

1109
01:30:27,160 --> 01:30:30,357
To begin with,
cover is a hole in the ground,

1110
01:30:30,480 --> 01:30:33,870
but as the enemy are rolled back
by succeeding waves of troops,

1111
01:30:34,000 --> 01:30:38,232
the men immediately behind
start serious digging.

1112
01:30:38,360 --> 01:30:42,148
The infantryman's home in battle
is his slit trench.

1113
01:30:42,280 --> 01:30:48,753
In a narrow five-foot hole,
he lives, sleeps, eats, and rests.

1114
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:55,831
If the men are lucky, rations, great coats
and mail are brought to them after dark.

1115
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:59,519
It's the missus again, of course.

1116
01:30:59,640 --> 01:31:02,438
She's having it away with a Yank now.

1117
01:31:02,560 --> 01:31:05,120
Hands across the sea,
straight up her woollies.

1118
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:07,397
<i>(shrieks with laughter)</i>

1119
01:31:09,960 --> 01:31:11,916
<i>(clattering)</i>

1120
01:31:12,920 --> 01:31:15,878
- Stop it!
- What are you laughing at?

1121
01:31:21,440 --> 01:31:24,750
I can't say it. I can say nothing.

1122
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:30,953
I'd like to say what I feel,
but I can only tell you what I see.

1123
01:31:31,080 --> 01:31:34,993
The weather's not bad
and I still write to you.

1124
01:31:35,120 --> 01:31:39,671
The words look so young on paper
and we are grown people.

1125
01:31:40,480 --> 01:31:46,271
But I'll tell you. I do miss you.
"Moonlight Cocktail" is now all the rage.

1126
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,994
...with an American soldier.
They're all over here now.

1127
01:31:53,120 --> 01:31:56,715
He thrust his great American hand
into my dress

1128
01:31:56,840 --> 01:32:01,356
and I felt the utility material
of which it was made, parachute silk,

1129
01:32:01,480 --> 01:32:05,553
tear asunder
under the thrust of his passion.

1130
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:09,876
Fondest ever always,
your own Mrs Clapper.

1131
01:32:16,720 --> 01:32:21,794
Gripweed, Clapper, cover yourselves.
They're coming from the right!

1132
01:32:26,480 --> 01:32:32,112
Sergeant Transom, tank and infantry
coming from the right. This side.

1133
01:33:41,120 --> 01:33:43,350
Sergeant Transom! Get out.

1134
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:45,192
Now, watch it.

1135
01:34:46,520 --> 01:34:48,636

- Steady on, we're still on it, the bridge.
- It is a lovely bridge.

1147

It is the only bridge
still intact across the Rhine.

Well, we could build one for 23,000.
Less. It's too far south for us, anyway.

1178
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:15,116
- I'd never get it past the accountants.
- Dooley! To me!

1179
01:39:15,240 --> 01:39:18,391
- My name is Dooley.
- I am not going. I'm just not going.

1180
01:39:18,520 --> 01:39:20,556
There's more to say.
I've got more to say.

1181
01:39:20,680 --> 01:39:23,353
- I'm not going without shouting.
- My name is Spool.

1182
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:27,439
I was transferred from the Service Corps
for a better chance of promotion.

1183
01:39:27,560 --> 01:39:31,633
- I'd like to speak to you on personal, sir.
- Transom!

1184
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:33,079
Here!

1185
01:39:33,200 --> 01:39:37,432
I never said a word to you
before I was dying... mate.

1186
01:39:37,560 --> 01:39:40,120
<i>(Drogue) I died in North Africa.</i>

1187
01:39:40,240 --> 01:39:43,437
I fought for three reasons.
I can't remember what they were.

1188
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:48,190
The first reason gets you in, and the
reason when you're in is staying alive.

1189
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:52,472
I won't know the reason they find
afterwards but it will be a very good one.

1190
01:39:52,600 --> 01:39:55,910
I'm sure we'll be glad,
and I'm not a thief, really.

1191
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:58,235
I never found anything worth keeping.

1192
01:40:01,480 --> 01:40:03,710
Suddenly, my phone rang.

1193
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:06,638
We were eager to secure
a Rhine river bridgehead

1194
01:40:06,760 --> 01:40:09,957
but we despaired of taking a bridge intact.

1195
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,196
Suddenly, my phone rang.

1196
01:40:12,880 --> 01:40:15,792
22,000, take it or leave it.

1197
01:40:15,920 --> 01:40:19,549
In view of the personal danger
to yourself, 19.

1198
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,113
Right, done.

1199
01:40:30,160 --> 01:40:32,037
Fine bleeding hospital this is.

1200
01:40:32,160 --> 01:40:34,879
Suddenly, my phone rang.

1201
01:40:35,000 --> 01:40:38,072
It was Hodges calling from Spa.

1202
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:42,034
"Brad" he called.
"Brad, we've gotten a bridge, a bridge."

1203
01:40:42,160 --> 01:40:45,197
"You mean you've gotten one
intact over the Rhine?"

1204
01:40:45,320 --> 01:40:46,799
"Yep."

1205
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:51,232
"Hot dog" I said,
"this'll bust them wide open."

1206
01:41:34,160 --> 01:41:35,673
They're coming.

1207
01:41:35,800 --> 01:41:36,755
Come on!

1208
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:40,710
It's ours, sir, it's ours!

1209
01:41:41,960 --> 01:41:43,916
One minute! One minute!

1210
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:48,200
- Get out of the way, you idiot!
- <i>(yells)</i>

1211
01:41:48,320 --> 01:41:50,276
Get out of it!

1212
01:41:53,640 --> 01:41:56,108
Bum on! Bum on!

1213
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:58,071
To Moscow!

1214
01:42:18,160 --> 01:42:21,436
We've come a long way, chaps.

1215
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:23,516
Now we've come to the end of the road.

1216
01:42:25,240 --> 01:42:28,789
Head up, Gripweed. Be proud.

1217
01:42:29,880 --> 01:42:32,348
Show them who's won the war.

1218
01:42:32,480 --> 01:42:38,669
Across the world, we've trod the stony
path from defeat to final victory.

1219
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:44,989
And soon, the Great Umpire above
will call close of play

1220
01:42:45,120 --> 01:42:47,554
in this, the Second World War.

1221
01:42:48,560 --> 01:42:51,313
Or as I prefer to call it...

1222
01:42:51,440 --> 01:42:53,556
the final test.

1223
01:42:55,480 --> 01:43:00,600
And I want to take this opportunity of
letting you know how proud I have been

1224
01:43:00,720 --> 01:43:04,474
to have commanded
such a fine body of men.

1225
01:43:09,160 --> 01:43:11,390
Would have bounced anyway.

1226
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:13,476
I haven't got 19d.

1227
01:43:14,720 --> 01:43:17,109
Transom, keep your feet up.

1228
01:43:17,240 --> 01:43:22,792
- What's he keep calling me that for?
- We're not out of the woods yet.

1229
01:43:24,840 --> 01:43:26,671
You haven't had a big part in this.

1230
01:43:26,800 --> 01:43:29,360
Ah, well. What you doing next?

1231
01:43:29,480 --> 01:43:33,553
- I hear there's this Vietnam thing coming.
- Yeah, I know that.

1232
01:43:33,680 --> 01:43:38,435
But I don't like working with that director
much. Still, the money's good.

1233
01:43:39,800 --> 01:43:42,553
I'm glad you could get here.

1234
01:43:42,680 --> 01:43:47,435
I've been trying to contact
all the members of Third Troop for years.

1235
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:51,348
And, really, without success.

1236
01:43:51,480 --> 01:43:57,953
The strange thing is, I agree, there was
a good reason for fighting the war.

1237
01:43:58,080 --> 01:44:03,950
I knew it. I felt really despicable.
We had to fight the war.

1238
01:44:06,080 --> 01:44:08,799
I couldn't, that's all. I just couldn't do it.

1239
01:44:08,920 --> 01:44:13,630
I had to leave it to chaps like you
who hadn't really got a reason.

1240
01:44:13,760 --> 01:44:18,038
- I wanted to fight, honestly.
- I know you did.

1241
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,156
But I won the war.

1242
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:49,117
