1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:03,418
June 1944,
during German occupation,

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,458
in a small French town
near the Spanish border...

3
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:51,254
The news is on the radio.

4
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,539
And this ends our programme.

5
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:02,970
This is the French national radio

6
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:05,654
...bringing you a speech...

7
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:08,413
...by Philippe Henriot
on the real enemies of France.

8
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,770
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

9
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,017
Some of you may listen,
from time to time,

10
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,409
to programmes broadcast
by enemy radio stations.

11
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:19,532
I'm not criticizing you for this,
but do invite you...

12
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:22,493
...to reflect on the monotony
of those voices.

13
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,209
Their music is always the same,
from London Algiers,

14
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,655
and it's the music many prefer.

15
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:31,659
The tone, style and
terminology...

16
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:34,254
...all carry the same
trade-mark.

17
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:37,295
The mark of the real enemies
of France.

18
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,769
Capitalists, Jews, Bolsheviks...

19
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:42,420
...do nothing but repeat
the same issues over and over.

20
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,049
Laval, in their opinion,
is a traitor.

21
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:47,449
Darlaine is called an agent
of the Gestapo...

22
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:51,328
...and I... a slave to
German propaganda.

23
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,494
One of these radios,
broadcasting out of London,

24
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:57,731
from where the deserter
ex-Colonel De Gaulle speaks,

25
00:01:58,140 --> 00:02:01,257
ironically put forward my name
for the "Legion of Honour"...

26
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:04,013
...as Minister of Propaganda.

27
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,058
I thank them,
but I don't want decorations.

28
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,615
I only want to show you...

29
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,089
...that history isn't written
with jokes of this kind.

30
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,854
- Hello, Lucien!
- Hi!

31
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:39,056
Eat up.

32
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,769
Don't make me fret.

33
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:52,415
What the hell are you doing
in my house?

34
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,052
Aren't you Lucien, Teresa's son?

35
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,013
This stuff isn't yours.
It all belongs to my father.

36
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:05,814
That may well be. Talk to the boss.
He'll explain everything.

37
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:46,610
What are you doing here, Lucien?

38
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,416
You get up late, nowadays.

39
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,216
It's Sunday.

40
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,608
Why did you get out
your father's gun?

41
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:20,291
You know that's forbidden.

42
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,530
Here! They gave me a raise
this month.

43
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,416
Thanks!

44
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,016
- Hello, Lucien.
- Good morning, Mr. Laborit.

45
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,489
Your son should let us know
when he's coming.

46
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:59,010
How long are you staying?

47
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,814
I have 5 days off.

48
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,495
Who are those people?
What are they doing in our house?

49
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,930
They're helping Mr. Laborit
so I had to put them up.

50
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,455
There have been a lot of
changes here.

51
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,970
Someone has to work.

52
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,613
Your father's been taken prisoner,
Joseph has gone underground.

53
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:48,014
- What?
- He's joined the Resistance.

54
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:50,739
Just imagine, I've a son
who's playing the hero!

55
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:45,136
- Do you want to become a priest?
- No, I certainly don't!

56
00:09:45,940 --> 00:09:48,408
They've dressed you up like one!

57
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,173
- Lucien!
- Ave!

58
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:24,218
Lucien, lift its head!

59
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:27,690
- That's it! Just a bit more!
- Push it! Like that!

60
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,774
A bit more!

61
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:41,695
Just a bit more! Come on!

62
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,015
We can make it!

63
00:10:57,580 --> 00:11:00,890
There we are!
Let's go and have a drink.

64
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,859
It was a really good horse.

65
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,779
You'll never find another one
like him!

66
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:47,816
"And the thunder...

67
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,290
...let out...

68
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,572
...its dull rumble..."

69
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:59,452
Look who's here!
Come on in, Lucien.

70
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:04,134
...heard far, far away.

71
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,252
My dear boy,
there's no hope for you.

72
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,456
Look what you've done.

73
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:19,249
I said "thunder" and
you wrote "thander".

74
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,017
There again, to watch over
sheep, good spelling...

75
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:26,217
...is not required.

76
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,929
Class is over so
you can go.

77
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,296
What do you want?

78
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,696
This is for you.

79
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,732
Thank you very much.

80
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,050
- Are you here just for this?
- I want to join the Resistance.

81
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:10,496
Why are you telling me?

82
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:13,658
You're the leader around here,
everyone knows that.

83
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,496
You're too young.

84
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,735
We already have too many
youths like you.

85
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,414
Anyway, it's a serious matter.
It's not like going poaching.

86
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:37,291
It means actual fighting,
do you understand?

87
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,414
I don't want to go back
to the rest home.

88
00:15:42,380 --> 00:15:44,814
You should be glad
you have that job.

89
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,817
No.

90
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,416
You can't stay here, Lucien.
Laborit won't allow you to.

91
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:57,619
- When your father comes back...
- There'll be hell to pay!

92
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:32,215
Lucien!

93
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:05,175
Dammit!

94
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,050
This wheel's done for.

95
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,653
Don't you know there a curfew?
Are you mad?

96
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:50,691
Young man! Are you here to spy?

97
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:54,658
Move! You've some explaining to do!

98
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,418
- Any news from Paris?
- The phone's not working.

99
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,971
Kid, come here! Come here!

100
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,656
Go on!

101
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,891
- Can you vouch for him?
- He's one of us.

102
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,052
Are you sure I can trust him?
Very well.

103
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:30,529
- Will he get 596?
- Yes.

104
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,770
Henry, are you going to tell me?

105
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:35,499
Did you know that curiosity
is a very nasty fault?

106
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,935
- Who's this?
- I found him in the garden.

107
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,897
- He was spying.
- That's not true.

108
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:42,448
I haven't done anything wrong.
I was returning to the rest home.

109
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,573
Don't you know it's forbidden
to be out after 10pm?

110
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,016
Why are you looking at me
like that?

111
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:54,653
Aren't you Henry Aubert,
the cycling champion?

112
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,016
- Have you seen me race?
- In the Tour of Toulouse, in '38.

113
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,739
I was with my father.
I saw you then.

114
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,410
So, you've recognized me.

115
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:08,418
- Are you from around here?
- No, I'm from Souillac.

116
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,616
I know someone in Souillac.

117
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:13,419
The pharmacist.
What's her name?

118
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:16,818
- Mrs. Cabessut.
- Right! That's her!

119
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,972
Brown-haired, tall,
with a pair of tits as big as this!

120
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:22,210
A fine looking woman!

121
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,616
Will you have a drink?

122
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,569
Marie, two shots of bitters!

123
00:21:34,100 --> 00:21:35,852
So, you're from Souillac.

124
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,215
- Have you been there?
- Yes, it's a nice place.

125
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,256
Wild...

126
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:42,814
- There are partisans in that area.
- I know.

127
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,856
You don't see much of them.

128
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:48,418
So, is that pharmacist still
on the ball?

129
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:00,978
Come on! Have another drop.

130
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,208
What's the school teacher's name?

131
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,973
Peyssac. Robert Peyssac.

132
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,731
They say he's a Mason.

133
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,457
- What does "Mason" mean?

134
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:16,978
- Is he the leader? Are you sure?
- Of course it's him,

135
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,576
- but he goes under another name.
- What?

136
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:24,935
Wait... Voltaire.
They call him "Commander Voltaire".

137
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:39,533
Hey, it's time to wake up!

138
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:43,419
Come on, get up.
They'll be opening the office soon.

139
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:48,418
- My head aches!
- Poor boy...

140
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,969
You drank too much last night.

141
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,210
Do you want an Asprin?

142
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:01,655
- Good morning, young man.
- Good morning, madam.

143
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,208
- Miss.
- Excuse me, Miss Chauvelot,

144
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,689
- there wasn't a room for him.
- That's all right.

145
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,409
- Enjoy your breakfast.
- Thanks.

146
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,129
- Good morning, Miss Chauvelot.
- How are you this morning?

147
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,132
- Fine, thank you.
- I've almost finished.

148
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:30,016
- What a lovely day!
- Lovely and hot, you mean!

149
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,810
Here!

150
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,771
It's for Lieutenant Miller.

151
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:42,296
- Thank you, Miss Chauvelot.
- Goodbye.

152
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:52,299
They're servile and meticulous too.

153
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,854
If we were like them,
we'd have won the war.

154
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:59,815
Bother! I've broken a nail.

155
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:08,297
- What were you saying, Mother?
- That I've broken a nail.

156
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:14,775
You've been drinking, Pierre.

157
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,898
- Alcohol is bad for you.
- I just had a drop.

158
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:21,932
It's nice in here
out of the heat

159
00:24:24,620 --> 00:24:26,895
Outside, it's like being
in Saigon.

160
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,773
- How's it going, young man?
- Fine, Mr. Tonin.

161
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:35,176
Don't you think he looks like
Paul?

162
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:40,249
Just a little.
Paul was thinner.

163
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:46,089
Read me the post, Mother.

164
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:51,978
"Gentlemen of the Gestapo,
as a grain dealer and...

165
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:54,210
...medal of valour holder,
I wish to inform you...

166
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:57,053
...of the suspicious trafficking
of a man called Louvelle Etiènne.

167
00:24:57,140 --> 00:24:59,495
- Not only does he..."
- Come on!

168
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:02,490
Keep walking!

169
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,698
I've brought you Commander Voltaire
while he's still warm.

170
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,975
He was in bed,
sleeping like a baby.

171
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,493
The little angel had some flyers
on his bedside table:

172
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,975
"The Germans are retreating
on all fronts...

173
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:18,528
...and soon, you will be free
in a free France."

174
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,896
The could at least ask us
our opinion.

175
00:25:21,260 --> 00:25:24,138
I don't want to be freed
by the Jews, for example.

176
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,735
I have my rights too, don't I?

177
00:25:26,860 --> 00:25:29,420
- Peyssac, listen...
- Be quiet, you scoundrel!

178
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,414
Welcome to our offices,
Mr. Peyssac.

179
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:34,856
Bring him upstairs.
I'll join you shortly.

180
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:40,813
- Shall I start working him over?
- No, wait for me.

181
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,859
You know, I never did like
teachers.

182
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:48,408
If you don't need me.
I'm going to take a shower.

183
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:51,139
Teachers are all Communists.
Are you a Communist too?

184
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:01,649
- What will you do to him?
- We'll have a little chat.

185
00:26:02,740 --> 00:26:05,459
We must find a job for
this boy.

186
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,450
He can help me
open the letters. Here!

187
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,736
You just have to do like this.

188
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,416
You go on ahead.

189
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,409
"I wish to bring
to your attention...

190
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:27,731
...that Mrs. Lebeaufe,
the milliner, often receives...

191
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:30,778
...visits from her two sons who
are draft dodgers and Communists."

192
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:33,820
- "No later than yesterday..."
- No, read another one.

193
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,097
"Sir, as a practicing Catholic,
I consider the black market...

194
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,490
...shameful for a Franchman
and a Christian."

195
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:53,016
That's enough! Aren't there any
serious matters this morning?

196
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:56,411
Yes. A protest
from the Prefect's office...

197
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:59,298
...following the disappearance
of Dr. Pradine.

198
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,255
Forget it, Mother.

199
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,575
Where are they going to look for
Dr. Pradine?

200
00:27:15,780 --> 00:27:17,816
I'm going to deal with Voltaire.

201
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,055
Are you Mr. Tonin's mother?

202
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,496
Of course not!
What a silly question!

203
00:27:44,220 --> 00:27:46,336
Do you get many like this?

204
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:49,572
We receive about 200 a day.

205
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,057
One came from a man who wrote
in to report himself!

206
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,810
It's a real mania!

207
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:07,250
Would you like to join
the police?

208
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,497
I don't really know.

209
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,817
You're young.

210
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,654
I think the Inspector
has taken a shine to you.

211
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:20,091
- Is Mr. Tonin the Inspector?
- He was.

212
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:25,897
- He was an excellent police officer
- And isn't he any more?

213
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:31,858
He was kicked out
as a criminal in '36...

214
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,130
...when the Socialists
were in power.

215
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,658
Children, you can't stay here.
Go and play elsewhere.

216
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:13,733
- Listen, Jean-Bernard...
- Yes, my love?

217
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,411
Do you know if there are any
night clubs in Toulouse?

218
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:20,458
No, Honey.
There's nothing in Toulouse.

219
00:29:21,020 --> 00:29:24,137
So, when are you taking me
to San Sebastian?

220
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,415
- At the end of the month.

221
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,260
- Is San Sebastian nice?
- You'll see.

222
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,808
There's a fantastic hotel
with everything you like in it.

223
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:33,936
I don't believe you!

224
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:36,250
- Have you ever used one of these?
- No.

225
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,090
It's very easy.

226
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,929
You must grip it firmly.

227
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:50,531
Raise your arm, very
relaxed, extend it fully...

228
00:29:50,620 --> 00:29:53,657
...and hold your breath.
Got that?

229
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:55,857
Here!

230
00:29:57,060 --> 00:30:00,211
- Aim at the left nostril.

231
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:04,689
I said the left nostril,
not the tie. Try again!

232
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:18,218
- He shoots better than you.
- That's not hard!

233
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,616
Get in.

234
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,576
Where are we going?

235
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:41,855
To Albert Horn.

236
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:45,056
Don't you know who he is?

237
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:47,975
One of the greatest Parisian
tailors.

238
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,410
Come on!

239
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:30,054
- Does he live here?
- Yes, he's in hiding.

240
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:32,576
He only works for me.

241
00:31:32,660 --> 00:31:35,413
I'd never have thought I'd find
him in this God-forsaken village.

242
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:38,900
As a boy, I was in
boarding school near here.

243
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:41,289
But I got expelled.

244
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:01,896
Oh, it's you.

245
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:06,010
Am I disturbing you?

246
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,857
- You never disturb me.
- I've brought you a client.

247
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,659
It's his first
made-to-measure suit.

248
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,855
An important milestone
in a man's life.

249
00:32:25,180 --> 00:32:27,296
Take off your jacket

250
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,972
What shall we choose for this
young man? A Prince of Wales,

251
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,733
or blue flannel like the suit
I made for you a month ago?

252
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,815
A Prince of Wales.
Do you agree, Lucien?

253
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,618
I couldn't care less.

254
00:32:57,660 --> 00:33:00,572
Do you remember the first time
I came to you, with my father?

255
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:04,455
I was 12 years old.

256
00:33:06,020 --> 00:33:10,650
You lived in
Rue Marbez at that time.

257
00:33:23,460 --> 00:33:25,416
Good morning.

258
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,610
Your mother's a little strange,
isn't she?

259
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,856
What lovely fabrics!

260
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:58,495
I got them for a song,
and a few petrol coupons.

261
00:34:02,780 --> 00:34:04,816
Did I ever tell you
where they come from?

262
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:10,420
From the warehouse of Cassels,
the English importer.

263
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,536
They confiscated all his goods.

264
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:15,056
And what happened to Cassels?

265
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:17,813
I think he's in a camp for
the British at St. Denis.

266
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:22,415
The one for the Jews
is in Drancy.

267
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,011
I know.

268
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,975
Thank you. That's all.

269
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:33,770
It'll be ready in 5 days.

270
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:40,336
Listen...

271
00:34:42,740 --> 00:34:44,731
...l've news about
the trip to Spain.

272
00:34:46,540 --> 00:34:48,735
You have to pay another
installment.

273
00:34:49,980 --> 00:34:52,574
Don't you think I've already
paid enough?

274
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:58,052
Increasingly harsh measures will be
taken against people like you.

275
00:34:58,820 --> 00:35:01,209
But I've already given you
2,000 francs.

276
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:03,894
They were just for
the forged papers.

277
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:08,413
This gentleman is a rich,
stingy Jew.

278
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:22,418
Stop playing.
The music is bothering me.

279
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:24,456
I'm with some clients.

280
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:36,090
Do you miss Paris?

281
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,933
Did you know there are more night
clubs there than in '39?

282
00:35:43,220 --> 00:35:45,450
War has its advantages,
don't you think?

283
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:56,938
The German High Command
has announced...

284
00:35:57,020 --> 00:35:58,976
...that yesterday,
its troops captured

285
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,016
several hundred
American prisoners.

286
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:05,009
This confirms the disarray
and low morale...

287
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,614
...of the Allied assault troops
in Normandy,

288
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,930
who have only managed
to build ridiculous...

289
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:17,699
By the British Command's
own admission...

290
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,979
That really is a good own!

291
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,934
It's very funny!
Where did you hear it, Lucien?

292
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,655
This isn't a Pink Lady!

293
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:39,413
Please, honey!
The girl's doing her best.

294
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:42,412
Do you know where I drank
the best Pink Lady?

295
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,412
In the bar in Rue Magellan.
The best bar in Paris!

296
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:52,975
Why don't you put on
some music?

297
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,733
Miss Beaulieu,
very serious things are happening.

298
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,214
Did you know I was a film
actress, Lucien?

299
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:07,416
- Really?
- Yes.

300
00:37:07,620 --> 00:37:10,817
Last year, I had a great role
in "Nights in the Casbah".

301
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:14,290
- Starring Yvonne Lévère.
- Then I can see you at the movies!

302
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,409
In Paris you could.

303
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,936
Unfortunately, in this godforsaken
village they only show old films.

304
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,817
That's true! Too bad!

305
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:31,298
It's just as I thought.
The Yanks don't know how to fight.

306
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,610
I've heard they send the negroes
to the front line.

307
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,611
You're prejudiced!

308
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:38,255
Are you sure they're telling
the whole truth?

309
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:40,331
- Are you joking?
- Not at all.

310
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:42,815
You need to listen to
Radio London as well...

311
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,056
...and then draw your conclusions.

312
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,736
Aren't you too hot
with that jacket on?

313
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:51,651
No.

314
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:00,856
Here!

315
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,140
"To Lucien,
so you'll remember me.

316
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:07,218
Wishing you the best
of luck, happiness...

317
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,256
...and success."

318
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:21,253
- Do you understand English?
- No. What use is it to me?

319
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,573
I've no intention of becoming
a turncoat, you know.

320
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:28,734
Would you like to know
what I think of the British?

321
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,016
I detest them.

322
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,489
They're better looking than
the French.

323
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,739
I was in love with
Leslie Howard.

324
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,929
There's a limit even to
stupidity, isn't there?

325
00:38:40,060 --> 00:38:43,018
What did you say?
Repeat what you said!

326
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:45,017
Are you looking for
a slap?

327
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:47,455
Do you always have to argue,
you two?

328
00:38:48,340 --> 00:38:50,570
Henry, a cognac.

329
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,969
- Still doing your accounts?
- Yes, unfortunately.

330
00:38:57,020 --> 00:39:00,092
You're an oaf, Mr. Faure!
A stupid oaf!!

331
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:02,410
Don't ever dare to speak
to me again!

332
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:04,934
There's a job for you
upstairs.

333
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,289
- Let's go.
- I'm coming too.

334
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,655
- It won't be a pretty sight.
- Lf it amuses her...

335
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:13,896
Yes, it will amuse me!

336
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,415
Anyway, I'm not interested in
knowing if the war will be won...

337
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,412
...by the Germans or the Americans!
I'm thinking of myself...

338
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:23,809
...and the time I'm wasting
in this dump,

339
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,255
among these pathetic people!

340
00:39:26,340 --> 00:39:28,296
If they were at least good looking!

341
00:39:30,220 --> 00:39:32,415
You're ruining my career,
you know?

342
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,978
Hello, Lopez?
This is Henry!

343
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:53,577
- Yes... yes...
- What's he saying?

344
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:55,730
Two wagons of shoes
on the Spanish border.

345
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:58,050
That's interesting but how can we
clear them through Customs?

346
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:00,415
It can be arranged. You just have
to pay, but in dollars.

347
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:02,616
- Tell him the deal's on.
- Good night.

348
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:04,656
The deal's on, Lopez.

349
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,218
Make all the arrangements.
Fine! 'Bye!

350
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,256
Would you like a chamomile tea?

351
00:40:10,340 --> 00:40:12,217
What? Wait... Say that again!

352
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:15,815
You don't want to spend another
night in Miss Chauvelot's office.

353
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,210
Yes, very well.

354
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:24,054
- Don't worry about a thing.
- I'm going up to my room.

355
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:27,413
- You wait here a while.
- Very well. 'Bye!

356
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:33,491
It's the 5th door on the right,
at the end of the corridor.

357
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:44,212
- Will you be much longer, Henry?
- Just a few moments, honey.

358
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:47,729
- Did you talk to the wholesaler?
- Yes.

359
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:50,892
He'll give you a big discount
on the chamois skins.

360
00:40:51,340 --> 00:40:53,979
- Are the Krauts interested in them?
- In the chamois skins?

361
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:56,130
Enormously!

362
00:40:58,180 --> 00:41:02,298
Mrs. Georges,
you're a great business woman.

363
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:06,530
- Is there any tanned leather about?
- Only untanned,

364
00:41:06,620 --> 00:41:09,612
- but it's very cheap.
- Really? Fine!

365
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:13,572
Maybe I can find
a little tanned leather too.

366
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:16,055
But it'll be expensive.

367
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,529
I just have to sell it on
with a good markup.

368
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:49,532
You've wet your pants,
Jean-Bernard!

369
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:58,736
So, Mr. Peyssac?

370
00:42:17,140 --> 00:42:19,415
Are you ready to talk now,
you swine?

371
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:21,975
He seems to be enjoying it,
damn him!

372
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:50,290
Don't get mixed up with them.

373
00:42:51,020 --> 00:42:53,136
They're different from us.

374
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:56,131
Anyway...

375
00:42:56,660 --> 00:43:00,414
...the Americans are going to win
the war. Everyone says so.

376
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,096
Did you hear me?

377
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,936
The Krauts are done for.

378
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:15,289
I'm telling you the Yanks will win.

379
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:36,409
Leave the talking to me.
I'm good at this.

380
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:40,208
I'd have like to be an actor.

381
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:43,530
I'd certainly have acted
better than Betty.

382
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,535
Are you Professor Baurgeois?

383
00:43:49,740 --> 00:43:51,696
Yes, I am.

384
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,576
We're partisans from
Lorsac.

385
00:43:54,940 --> 00:43:57,500
The Germans attacked us and
I've a bullet in my leg.

386
00:43:58,660 --> 00:44:02,448
I'm on vacation and therefore
not equipped to treat you.

387
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:08,090
Very well. Come inside.

388
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:25,058
Patrick, go and get my bag,

389
00:44:25,300 --> 00:44:27,860
- some bandages and surgical spirit.
- Right away!

390
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,335
He's my son.

391
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:45,090
Lie down.

392
00:44:54,540 --> 00:44:56,815
It was my companions
who told me about you.

393
00:44:57,060 --> 00:44:59,654
Especially Commander Merit.

394
00:45:00,060 --> 00:45:02,893
I see. So you know Merit.

395
00:45:03,140 --> 00:45:05,893
- Yes, very well.
- He's a friend.

396
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,735
He sends me a lot of
his boys.

397
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:16,938
I'm very sorry.
German police.

398
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,813
It's a real pity.
Keep you eye on him.

399
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:28,451
Hands up!

400
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,256
Go on! Move!

401
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:44,137
- What's happening? I heard a shot!
- Don't worry, dear.

402
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,290
Good morning, madam.

403
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:03,296
It's very pretty.

404
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:09,013
Are you, by any chance,
relatives of Philipe Baurgeois?

405
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:11,854
- Yes.
- I met him.

406
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:15,013
In September 1938.

407
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:18,179
- Really?
- A very nice guy.

408
00:46:19,180 --> 00:46:22,695
Excellent tennis player.
He always beat me.

409
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,658
- Who's that?
- My great-grandmother.

410
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:05,415
- What's the score?
- I was right.

411
00:47:05,500 --> 00:47:07,411
He works for Merit.

412
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:10,173
Come on, Paul, do something!
Call the Prefect!

413
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,218
Stay calm.

414
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,695
Hello? Yes?

415
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:32,096
You want to speak to Professor
Baurgeois? Just a moment.

416
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,568
It's Professor Baurgeois' brother.
What'll I tell him, Boss?

417
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,810
That we're about to shoot him.

418
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:41,813
We're about to shoot him, sir.
Yes, shoot him.

419
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:45,097
- Give him my regards.
- My respects, sir.

420
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:49,051
He hung up.

421
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:57,651
What interesting things can you
tell me about Commander Merit?

422
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:01,532
A man like you helping the rebels.
That's the limit!

423
00:48:01,660 --> 00:48:03,616
France run by the Communists.
Is that what you want?

424
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:05,975
- I'm a Gaullist.
- You know full well that De Gaulle

425
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:08,858
...is surrounded by Jews
and Communists. A few names?

426
00:48:08,940 --> 00:48:11,818
- Do you consider Schumann French?
- Enough talk of politics!

427
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:19,169
Now, Doctor, tell us everything
you know about Merit.

428
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:25,295
You'll tell us something,
won't you?

429
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:34,134
- Not bad, is it?
- Right. Put it in the sack.

430
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:41,176
Don't worry.
We've plenty of time.

431
00:48:41,740 --> 00:48:45,289
Try to remember everything
you know about Commander Merit.

432
00:48:45,380 --> 00:48:48,895
- I don't know anything.
- Naturally!

433
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:53,252
We know you've supplied Jews
with forged papers.

434
00:48:53,740 --> 00:48:56,129
Not only papers.

435
00:48:56,740 --> 00:48:59,413
- What's this?
- It's the "Bandera".

436
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:02,576
I built it myself.

437
00:49:05,260 --> 00:49:07,410
It took me a year.

438
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,418
- It's almost finished.
- Is it difficult?

439
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:17,815
Yes, especially the portholes.

440
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:25,172
So... are you like your father?

441
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:28,409
You know nothing about
the partisans?

442
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:12,692
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

443
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:51,009
Your suit is ready.

444
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:56,976
I made the pants plus-fours. They
are more stylish on a young man.

445
00:51:05,900 --> 00:51:08,209
Do you like plus-fours?

446
00:51:15,340 --> 00:51:18,138
I could have made you normal pants

447
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:22,653
but I find there's something more
in plus-fours.

448
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:26,456
Something more...

449
00:51:26,540 --> 00:51:28,735
What does "plus-fours" mean?

450
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:33,420
It means... like these.

451
00:51:41,820 --> 00:51:44,209
You'd best try them on.

452
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,775
So these are plus-fours?

453
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:44,136
Yes.

454
00:52:52,060 --> 00:52:55,655
- Are you from here?
- No, from Souillac.

455
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:02,656
Are you a friend of
Jean-Bernard's?

456
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:04,696
Yes.

457
00:53:06,780 --> 00:53:09,010
What do you do? Are you a student?

458
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,976
Are you here on vacation?

459
00:53:14,300 --> 00:53:16,894
I'm in the German police...

460
00:53:33,020 --> 00:53:35,932
I knew Jean-Bernard's father.

461
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:39,535
The Earl of Voisin.
An exceptional man.

462
00:53:42,020 --> 00:53:44,818
He used to worry a lot
about his son.

463
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,656
So, you're a Jew...

464
00:53:59,460 --> 00:54:02,497
Faure says that Jews
are enemies of France.

465
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:04,970
No.

466
00:54:05,980 --> 00:54:08,175
I'm not.

467
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,254
- Are you from Paris?
- Yes.

468
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:28,129
I was very good at my job.

469
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:34,136
I had good clients,

470
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:38,136
lots of friends...

471
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:42,415
- What do you want?
- I'm going to the shops.

472
00:54:42,500 --> 00:54:44,456
May I have some money?

473
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:57,455
Won't you introduce me, Daddy?

474
00:54:58,460 --> 00:55:00,849
My daughter, France.

475
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:03,896
Lacombe Lucien.

476
00:55:04,380 --> 00:55:06,496
Be quick! Bye-bye.

477
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,456
See you later.

478
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:25,658
Jean-Bernard told me to ask
you for the money you owe him.

479
00:55:53,140 --> 00:55:55,813
Tell Jean-Bernard his father
would be very sad...

480
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:58,494
...to see all this.

481
00:55:59,140 --> 00:56:01,415
He was a true gentleman.

482
00:56:04,340 --> 00:56:06,490
But then, what do I care?

483
00:57:03,260 --> 00:57:05,216
Come with me.

484
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,900
Get in line, like everyone else!

485
00:57:14,980 --> 00:57:17,414
Who do those two think
they are? Get back!

486
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,139
Where has she sprung from?
Go to the back of the line!

487
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:27,934
Young people think they're
in charge, nowadays! Get back!

488
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:31,258
- You're a man. Can't you tell him?
- No.

489
00:57:31,580 --> 00:57:35,016
Just look at the cheek of them!
I've been queuing for an hour!

490
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:37,489
Do you think I've nothing to do?

491
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:41,050
- We have priority! German Police!
- We don't give a damn about that!

492
00:57:41,260 --> 00:57:43,694
Don't you think
you're overdoing it?

493
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,575
Hey you! What's going on here?

494
00:57:51,460 --> 00:57:53,610
German police.

495
00:57:54,820 --> 00:57:57,573
- Do you work for Mr. Tonin?
- Yes, I do.

496
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:02,733
I do apologize,
but I didn't recognize you.

497
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:46,052
But why do you keep
harping on about it?

498
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:50,849
A year later.
I don't understand why you did it.

499
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,411
There's nothing to understand.
I loved him.

500
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:58,775
- And did he love you?
- Why not? What do you know?

501
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:02,819
After what he did,
I wouldn't trust him much.

502
00:59:02,900 --> 00:59:05,972
Daddy, please stop it!
Don't make me angry!
