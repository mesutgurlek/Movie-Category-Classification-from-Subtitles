00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,955
(polish)

3
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:42,838
Hello, Doctor.
- Good Day.

4
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:45,878
Say, am i crazy?
I thought they«ll arrive tomorrow?

5
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:49,316
Yes, that«s correct.
That«s the problem.

6
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,518
The transport was planned for tomorrow.
I haven«t prepared anything yet.

7
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,718
I hope they are vaccinated.
- Not at all.

8
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,792
They have been channeled through in Hamburg

9
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,993
Everyone got a kipper and away they went

10
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,029
No! Barack 6, i said!
They are all deaf. Barack 6, i say!

11
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,509
One moment, Doctor, i«m coming. Nowak!
I«ll talk with him about you.

12
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,990
We have to order some more lymph.
I also need some needles.

13
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,788
All done, Doctor.

14
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,033
Doctor, what«s the problem?
They«ll start a riot here!

15
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:46,153
They know when the office hours are.
- I ordered them here.

16
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,632
Not you. Go home.
You should come back next week.

17
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:56,029
The pain will be there allright.
How«s your eye? Let«s have a look.

18
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,431
(speaks polish)

19
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,192
A drink?
- No thanks, Doctor.

20
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:09,637
But i«ll have my cigar.
- Yes.

21
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:13,712
I believe you have too much stress.

22
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,873
No, not because of that.
- I forbid that.

23
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,953
You should make this a habbit too. - Yes.

24
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,153
Let«s examine your eye.
- Yes, you«ll see it.

25
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:29,352
How can this be done allone?

26
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,433
doctor here, hospital there.
Also, a cold,

27
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,229
and what else one got.
No, that«s too much. - beautiful.

28
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,231
beautiful is the eye.

29
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:46,515
How about an assistant? I have one for you.

30
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:54,633
Keep warm.
Tomorrow, Placzek. Yes?

31
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,995
Adieu.
- Thanks, Doctor.

32
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,672
How was it?

33
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,793
Look, how often do i have to tell you
to leave me alone?

34
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:07,993
I«m happy when i«m alone.
And when i need someone,

35
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:12,033
who goes on my nerves,
I have you. - what you like.

36
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,153
You can tell it to me,
if you change your mind.

37
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,313
This many came with the others today
and he«ll stay for a while.

38
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,393
He«s a chemist from Kattowitz.
Nowak is his name.

39
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,308
He was an assistant once.

40
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:31,473
Do you mind if we
vaccinate him in the cafeteria?

41
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,599
It«s too cramped in here, or?
You can examine him in here.

42
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:39,150
Leaves a good impression.
- Yes, yes.

43
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,719
I«ll be there in an hour.
I have a few visits to make. - Ok.

44
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,235
All right, Nowak. With such an white coat
you almost look like an doctor.

45
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,273
If the boss is in a good mood,
he«ll let you operate as well.

46
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:03,072
We have to finish with the inoculations.
The cafeteria has to be ready.

47
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:06,152
The folks haven«t eaten yet.

48
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,110
Stop smoking in here!
You know that it«s not allowed.

49
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,799
Hard to belive. He can«t be without an
cigarette not for an moment.

50
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,390
You too!
That«s Dr. Neumeister.

51
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:24,670
(Doctor) Next, please. Hurry up!
The faster you can leave again.

52
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,351
Doctor? Here«s Nowak.
You did want to think it over, or?

53
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,512
Well, he can join.
- There you are. Very well.

54
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:37,914
You know the facts, Nowak, or?
Please come in my office later.

55
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:44,313
Ask her, in which month she is.
- in the seventh.

56
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,718
Then i can«t vaccinate her.
Lucky you. Next, please.

57
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,793
Keep your nerves, Doctor.
Nowak, that«s me.

58
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,912
Yes,it could not be avoided.

59
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,078
Can i take your place?

60
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,871
(Music)

61
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,431
(Music)

62
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,993
Please help yourself.
- Excuse me, Doctor.

63
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:14,353
I did knock on the door,
but it seems your haven«t heard it.

64
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:18,956
You are right.

65
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:23,033
All the things we could speak about,

66
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:27,756
aren«t very comfortable.
why should we mention them then?

67
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:40,311
Please interpret your silence as 
substantial arrangement,.

68
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,992
Yes, a mutual and substantial
arrangement.

69
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,471
(Knocking on the window)

70
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,754
Who was that?

71
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,994
Are your frightened?

72
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:10,909
It«s goat milk.
A nice girl, just a bit crazy.

73
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,993
She brings me goat milk every evening.
Strange, you are frightened.

74
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,553
Oh, that«s a pre cautious habit of mine.

75
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,878
The past years did leave their marks.

76
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:27,077
Me too.
- Do you have a cigarette?

77
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,674
In former times i could have helped
you.

78
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,752
Well, that«s over.
- I«ll get you one.

79
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,639
Do you remember Winkler?

80
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:41,197
He did shoot him in his head when they
were after him.

81
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,995
No really?  Winkler?

82
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,079
Yes, he did change his name too.
Well, you have a civilized life here.

83
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,311
Well yes.
- compared to the circumstances.

84
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:58,633
My circumstances are less civilized.
But resettlement transports are practical .

85
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,315
Do you understand?
Who«s got papers?

86
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,314
Poor Winkler is dead?

87
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,593
Strange, now it«s only us.
You and I.

88
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:16,231
You didn«t want to believe that we
are in the same boat.

89
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,950
Now you won«t doubt that again.

90
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,953
I mean, i don«t think that one of us
can leave.

91
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,828
We both did change our name,
Dr. Neumeister.

92
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:31,789
And you are frightened. You know, 
i almost like you.

93
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:36,431
Don«t make more than there is out of our
random encounter . - random?

94
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,552
random...
- Yes, yes. What«s going on?

95
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,152
Nothing. Just the bottle is empty.

96
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:48,273
How about going in the cafeteria and
continuue our little chat there?

97
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,911
One moment, please...you always were 
a strange saint and now

98
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:56,959
What«s strange about that? Or do you 
prefer an empty bottle?

99
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,032
All right, i won«t resist.

100
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,669
We have to celebrate our encounter.
Especially because it«s random.

101
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,471
It«s random, or?

102
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:12,593
It«s not as lxurious as our 
institute.

103
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,712
(Nowak)
There you are again boss!

104
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:20,709
I have to welcome someone.
An old friend of mine.

105
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,191
Nice chap, very relaiable.

106
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,879
Good evening.
- Good evening, Doctor.

107
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,394
Placzek, didn«t i tell you to keep
the eye warm?

108
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,473
That«s a scandal.
That«s to keep it warm.

109
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,034
Did you had lunch already?
- Not really.

110
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,111
Thank you. I won«t resist.

111
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:56,152
A beer?
- Yes, a beer please.

112
00:12:56,400 --> 00:13:01,394
And a bottle cognac.
That«s why we came here, hm?

113
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:04,313
Yes.
- You did forgot your cigarettes.

114
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:08,393
Really? Oh, thank you.
- I did forget matches.

115
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:16,072
You don«t have to be frightened here.
You are save here. Absolutely save.

116
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:21,359
Just relax.
The doors are closed, windows are closed.

117
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:26,351
Everything«s quiet now.
Nothing will come in.

118
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,391
The fear will stay outside.

119
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:34,630
We are finished. We are there.

120
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,599
Or, Liske?
- Nobody will come. You are the last ones.

121
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:43,029
Yes. We are the last ones.

122
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,792
Now we are here.

123
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,275
I do like you much more,
since i know that you know the feeling.

124
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,956
Since i know that you are frightend.
- Ah, ok! Correct.

125
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,873
but...

126
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,757
I don«t understand.
Fear... what for?

127
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:17,672
You only know the feeling of uneasiness,
that provokes the fear.

128
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,393
You don«t know what an almighty feeling
fear is.

129
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,995
I tell you:
Fear kills every other feeling. Every other.

130
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,190
Yes. It kills.

131
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:37,355
Some kill for the fear of others.

132
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,234
What does remain?

133
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,716
Let«s drink to our random encounter!

134
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:49,556
Liske, do you want to cheer too?
by chance?

135
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,678
Oh, he«s sleeping.

136
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,398
Well yes.

137
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,117
Prost, Hoesch! Ich meine, Nowak.

138
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,193
How was that?
A mutual and substantial arrangement.

139
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:12,076
You really are hungry.
- Tastes very good.

140
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,790
There, there. He«s hungry, he«s frightened.

141
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:21,078
Almost human.
- Don«t talk so much, Doctor!

142
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:25,188
You«re turning like a roundabout.

143
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,833
Condemned man's breakfast.

144
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,672
Either you«re crazy or drunk.

145
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:37,391
It would be good if you«d say it 
straight.

146
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,198
Do you remember this?

147
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:47,318
Is that mine?
- Yes.

148
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,432
Is it always with you?
- Yes!

149
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,878
That«s good. You still have the gun.

150
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,951
Strange, hm?
- Cheers, Doctor!

151
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,958
Pst! - what«s going on?
He«s awake.

152
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,679
See?

153
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,192
Nothing that«s alive does sleep so deep
that it couldn«t awake. 

154
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,436
If it«s alive!

155
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,075
Strange, hm?
- Yes, strange.

156
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,956
Doctor, I«ll leave now.
I have to get up very early tomorrow.

157
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,349
Good night, Doctor.
- Good night.

158
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:27,830
Turn out the lights, yes?
- yes.

159
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,993
I«ll leave the key.
I«ll pick it up tomorrow.

160
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,112
Don«t forget it, please.
- No.

161
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:40,999
I don«t forget anything.
- what«s the matter?

162
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:45,756
What do i want from you?
I«m on the run. Without papers.

163
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,752
I did help you once too.

164
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,758
He did help me, he says.

165
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:21,079
You do blame me for this, hm?

166
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:26,393
Well, I have to pay my depts then.
Depts have to be paid.

167
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,154
Must be a heavy dept.
Very heavy.

168
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:37,114
You did help me in the past 
and i have to help you today, it«s simple.

169
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,197
You«re on the run, you said.
Yes...

170
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,193
I have to take care
that you now find piece on your escape.

171
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,193
I have to start to
pay my dept.

172
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:59,676
You can«t shoot.
- Now i«m to blame as well.

173
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:06,273
Must be heavy.
You know, it bears me down.

174
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:08,557
Just think about it:

175
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,999
Since December, the 8th 1943.

176
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,516
With tax...

177
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,151
It«s heavy.

178
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,198
wait...

179
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,758
the strange thin is..
I had it very good in the past,

180
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,308
when you imposed your help on me.

181
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,075
Yes,
the railroad was always overcrowded.

182
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:36,551
The main thin was that i had a job.
That was all i needed.

183
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,918
(Nowak)
You did have a good life, Doctor.

184
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,312
Simply your appearance!
Very striking for the times.

185
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,756
(Rothe) I had a lot property,
but else...

186
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,719
Well, you did get my cigarettes
they were indispensable.

187
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,952
An the good Dolien, my secretary.
You do remember her? 

188
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,111
My coffee was always there.

189
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:02,194
But one morning i didn«t had the chance 
to drink it.

190
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,272
A certain Mr. Winkler did wait for me.

191
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,399
I didn«t know him. It was important to him
to speak with me alone.

192
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,553
In a private matter.
"Very private ", he added.

193
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:17,792
I showed him the Institute. First the laboratory.

194
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,399
Good morning, Doctor.

195
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:24,389
Good morning, Hoesch.
Did you check the probes?

196
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:28,473
Yes! Number 99 shows good results.
- very good.

197
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:32,593
The antibiotic effect is 10% over the 
average.

198
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,872
We can use it for the mutation experiments
then.

199
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,159
Yes. How long do you want to radiate them?
- Oh, start with 5 minutes.

200
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:49,673
Here.
- Thank you.

201
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,794
Well, Hoesch, in another row you 
can let examine your rabbit blood.

202
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,912
Good morning, Schake.
- Good morning, Doctor.

203
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:04,079
Only the rabbits do listen here.
- Maxe does wait for you already.

204
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:07,470
But Doctor!
- Yes. What«s up? Ah ok!

205
00:20:07,560 --> 00:20:11,838
You know, no smoking here.
Sorry, colonel, just one moment.

206
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,236
Certainly. That«s interesting.

207
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:18,154
Yes it is. Our little Maxi
is a very interesting one.

208
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,073
Don«t let him die. Right, Maxi?

209
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,670
at least not before we have 
finished our experiments.

210
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:30,149
Doctor, i can«t see blood.

211
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,680
It«s more harmless than it looks.

212
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,753
Just a little bit from 
the ventricle.

213
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,993
Maxi is used to it, hm?
- I really can«t see any blood.

214
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,033
It«s ok with people,
but not with such innocent animals.

215
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:52,070
So, everting«s allright. It«s over,
you can go home again.

216
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:56,993
So Mr. Winkler, how was your
first operation?

217
00:20:57,080 --> 00:21:01,039
Very well, thanks.
- Not much worse than human blood?

218
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:05,272
Schake, please do me a favor?
Take the blood into the Sereologic Institute.

219
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,999
You can clean the desk later!

220
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,073
Dear hevaen - so much blood.
Is that all from the little rabbits?

221
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:17,673
Not only rabbits,
there also some guinea pigs.

222
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,470
That«s Schakes work desk.
Finally we can talk.

223
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,031
Hoesch, leave us alone for a moment, yes?
I«ll join you later.

224
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,998
What«s up? Something urgent?

225
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,352
Pardon me, Colonel?
- All right. Now you«re there.

226
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,593
I«d have asked for Hoesch nonetheless

227
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,672
You know each other.
- Yes.

228
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,068
Well, there you have it doctor.

229
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:53,553
Then we already were close to the core of 
the issue then.

230
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,512
You could have thought that our
Institute is for defense. 

231
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,068
Defense?
- but Doctor!

232
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:05,637
You did notice that the times aren«t 
normal?

233
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:09,315
What defense?  counterintelligence of course.
- Of course.

234
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:13,672
Tell me: who«s protecting me?
You?

235
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:18,470
That«s right. I«m colonel Winkler and
responsible for the Institute.

236
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:22,792
Do you know what«s going on, Doctor?
No, you can«t.

237
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:24,911
You«re in trouble.

238
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:28,993
And experiment with your new probe.
You know what?

239
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:33,073
The results are already known in 
London. Hard to believe, what? - Yes.

240
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:38,479
Yes, i know. But here are the charts and
the instructions.

241
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:44,194
Now listen, Doctor. We don«t want
to make a big deal out of this.

242
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:48,393
Honestly, we have cold feets.
Very cold feets.

243
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,278
We all failed.

244
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:55,439
But what you did, that«s impossible.

245
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:59,513
Taking home war ducuments and with a 
young girl, 

246
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,673
who knows you well, dictating
to a machine.


247
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,195
Who do you mean?
- Mrs Hermann!

248
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:10,313
But you know that her father lives
in Stockholm. - Yes i know.

249
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,911
And the whole stuff went over Stockholm
to London.

250
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,111
Do you have proof?

251
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:21,393
Mrs Herman did tell,
but exactly in the wrong situation.

252
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,711
Of course without a clue.

253
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:28,793
Dr. Rothe is engaged to Mrs.Hermann.
- Oh. Pardon.

254
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,273
Yes, my dear Doctor, don«t believe that
let«s say, 

255
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:38,353
i«m very fond of these direct methods.

256
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:42,473
Anyhow: You«re warned.
That was the purpose of my visit.

257
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,479
Hoesch, bring me to the car.
Good bye, Doctor. - Good bye.

258
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:53,198
Mrs. Hermann isn«t that the lady with the
funny letters,

259
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:58,035
which you showed me. Unbelievable!
Dr. Rothe and such a slut?

260
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:19,394
Dr. Rothe? I wanted to tell you:
It couldn«t be avoided,

261
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:24,350
to tell you the facts...

262
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,314
Doctor?
- yes.

263
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,119
You did promise me that
i can leave at 7 today. - Yes.

264
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:47,794
Your coat.

265
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:55,958
Dr. Rothe?
- Yes? What did you want to tell me?

266
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:01,431
I owe you an explanation.
About Mrs Hermann.

267
00:25:02,920 --> 00:25:06,833
Now you know,
that it«s part of my job,

268
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,833
to be informed about everything here in 
the institute.

269
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,833
That strange 
London-Stockholm-story...

270
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:18,833
did lead me inevitably, from you
to Mrs Hermann.

271
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:20,911
Inevitably,?
- Yes.

272
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:26,152
Believe me, it wasn«t my intension.

273
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:30,631
But Mrs Hermann did fit very well
with my plans...

274
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:35,758
It would be better if you wouldn«t 
make any illusions.

275
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:39,037
The girl isn«t worth it,
Doctor.

276
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,911
This spy case is ridiculous,
and we have slowed down it quite a bit.

277
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:47,470
She can do what she wants.

278
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:52,271
You«ll have to talk to her of course.

279
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:56,473
No problem, I«ll tell her like it is.

280
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,989
I prefer that.

281
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:03,113
I«ll call you tonight, if you need me.

282
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:07,188
Don«t worry because of Inge, Doctor.

283
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:11,273
There«s only one thing to do:
Finish it, simply finish it!

284
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:33,951
(Music)

285
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,473
(Colonel) How«s that possible?
Dr. Rothe and such a slut.

286
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,473
(Nowak) Don«t worry about them.

287
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:08,833
There«s only one thing to do:
Finish it, simply finish it!

288
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,396
(Music)

289
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,191
(Music)

290
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:36,031
You«re late today.
I«m starving.

291
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:40,232
I did wait for you.

292
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:43,758
(Mother)
Good evening, Karl.

293
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,437
Sorry that i«m eating already.
I have to go to PoppenbŸttel.

294
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:54,512
Yes, mother wants to see
if she gets a few potatoes.

295
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,631
(Music)

296
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:06,155
What«s up with him? Do you think 
it«s because of me...

297
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,832
No.

298
00:29:09,520 --> 00:29:12,398
I«ll miss my bus.

299
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:18,439
I«ll go now, lngelein.
I«ll be back at 10.30.

300
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,991
Good night, lngelein.

301
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:34,753
Ah, there you are.
where have you been?

302
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,873
Ingelein, give the mile to the cat.

303
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:43,073
But let the milk cool down first,
if it«s too hot. Got it?

304
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,435
Got it, lngelein?
- Yes.

305
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:55,677
But lngelein. I only told you 
that you should give the milk to the cat.

306
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,150
What«s wrong?
- Nothing, sorry.

307
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:03,273
But Ingelein, you don«t have to excuse yourself.

308
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:06,870
I didn«t meant it that way.
- Of course not!

309
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:11,033
You don«t have to tell me that!
You never care!

310
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:14,715
Pshh.
- don«t "Pshh" me!

311
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:20,356
I know, the neighbours.
that«s what you care about.

312
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:24,599
I can die here.
- the cat has to have something.

313
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,912
Of course, as long as the cat has it«s milk
and Dr. Rothe his lunch.

314
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:33,312
but what about me?
That deosn«t matter at all!

315
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,511
(Music)

316
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:52,591
(Music)

317
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,914
(lnge)
Say something.

318
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:11,518
What can i say?
There«s nothing to say.

319
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,429
Then i realized that she talked.
What she talked was a confession.

320
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:24,114
that«s how women confess: admit,
more admit and more admit

321
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,113
Only the one important thing,
that is withhold.

322
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,399
At least it was a confession,
She told me about you, Hoesch.

323
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:39,074
She wanted reconciliation.
she got it i think.

324
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:43,553
Suddenly something happened..
The phone rang.

325
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,437
It suddenly was as if they
were all in the room in person.

326
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,111
(ring)

327
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:59,399
Don«t pick up.
We simply aren«t at home.

328
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:05,276
Yes? Hoesch.

329
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,635
Well yes...
but it wasn«t my fault.

330
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:29,712
He didn«t want to talk to me but
to you.

331
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,871
(ring)

332
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,951
Let him be.

333
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,791
(Music)

334
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,031
(Music)

335
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,029
Well.

336
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:03,393
It coudn«t be reversed.

337
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:05,279
Never again.

338
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:10,953
I still don«t know why and how
it happened.

339
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:16,279
I didn«t know a thing, 
believe me.

340
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:22,516
Sure. You weren«t yourself.
Simply didn«t attend, hm?

341
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:31,031
What«s the problem? Do you have any doubts?

342
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,597
No. if you say so.
- I say so.

343
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,478
Well and then... then..

344
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:55,558
Then i had something in my hands, 
i belive. Yes...

345
00:37:56,120 --> 00:38:00,113
I played with it, without knowing
what it was.

346
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,877
Yes, and when i was conscious again,

347
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,360
A lot of time must have passed.

348
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,993
I heard voices.
outside in the hall.

349
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,711
(mumbling)

350
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:29,149
Children, I have to go to Hollemanns.
There are no potatoe in PoppenbŸttel.

351
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,711
Yes, the bag.

352
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:38,318
I won«t frighten the Hollemans with 
my back pack.

353
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:43,839
Ah... Karl? Just go in.
Hoesch wants to talk to you.

354
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:48,191
(Knocking)

355
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,273
Doctor, what going on?
I tried to call you.

356
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,312
I dont understand. What«s going on?

357
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:08,634
There we have it.
You on the sofa, the body in front of you.

358
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:11,679
What a situation!

359
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:16,790
Others would have squealed you,
but not me.

360
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:21,518
I knew it immediately.

361
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:24,592
Who is it?
- Well, the State.

362
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:30,554
It was clear, something must happen.
And it did happen. Do you remember?

363
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:35,233
Two phone calls,
the rescue action was started,

364
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,632
Half an hour later
Colonel winkler was there.

365
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:44,998
Do this without a sound.

366
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:49,113
Sooner or later we would have 
take care of Hermann

367
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:53,079
but this way she comes to an
normal funeral.

368
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:55,151
Colonel, the police.

369
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:03,190
By the way, Hoesch, don«t think
that i like your methods.

370
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:07,553
Good night, Colonel.
- We«ll handle this:

371
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:12,879
department 4. Please make your 
report.

372
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:16,953
You take care of the papers.
Clearly suicide.

373
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:41,953
why does a human want to hang?

374
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:45,032
Or what else there is

375
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:49,637
You and your justice fanatism,
what«s that worth in reality?

376
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:54,430
Only feelings. And that for woman
who«s out of question.

377
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:58,798
Engaged with a man like you 
and sleeps with the man next door.

378
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:02,470
Hoesch did you a favor,
Dr. Rothe!

379
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:09,515
Your antiquated ethical lifestyle
doesn«t fit in these times.

380
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,912
IS that right, Hoesch?
- Yes, Colonel.

381
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,077
Just do you experiments.

382
00:41:20,360 --> 00:41:25,832
Keep on working and get along with the 
fact that you«re still alive.

383
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,959
Inge Hermann,
born September the 3rd, 1919 in Hamburg,

384
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:34,033
Magdalenenstraße 1 7,
death am December the 8th, 1943.

385
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:39,595
Diagnosis: suicide
strangulation with a belt.

386
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:43,116
Number: AZ 1384-43.

387
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:48,436
The body can be burried.

388
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,351
(Music)

389
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,471
(bells)

390
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:13,278
(Rothe) From murder to
suicide.

391
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,751
and nobody asked.
Even Mrs.Hermann didn«t ask.

392
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:20,229
Good evening, Karl.
- Good evening, Mrs Hermann.

393
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:24,313
I forgot to get some beer. Perhaps...

394
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:29,714
you want to go to a restaurant.

395
00:42:30,280 --> 00:42:35,400
Yes, i wanted to go away.
- The button isn«t fixed.

396
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:43,992
Karl?

397
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:48,592
I did pack your stuff already.

398
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,439
Thank you.

399
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:12,313
Karl,
where do you want me to send the post?

400
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:15,392
I«ll tell you.

401
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:22,757
The bill is on the desk.

402
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,633
Gas- and power is deducted until today.

403
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:31,315
The rest is there too.
- Mrs Hermann...

404
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,073
Don«t say anything. I know
you can«t stay here

405
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,755
with all your memories.
I can understand this.

406
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:44,230
I don«t want you to persuade,
but...

407
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:50,918
i«m an old woman. Inge is gone,
and now you...

408
00:43:52,320 --> 00:43:57,519
I can«t stand it seeing you 
leaving.

409
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:10,479
Do you want me to play the role
of the dead in your life?

410
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,994
Anyhow,

411
00:44:13,080 --> 00:44:16,914
somehow she made it.

412
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,993
I didn«t leave, i lived together with her,

413
00:44:21,120 --> 00:44:25,193
but it was the opposite of what i wanted

414
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:29,796
one survives.
- Don«t you understand?

415
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:33,350
I couldn«t.
I wasn«t allowed to!

416
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:37,433
Do you have an idea what you did? 
To let me live?

417
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:42,674
It was war. Thousands died every day,
we wanted to spare one.

418
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:46,753
Me, of all people.
- You were lucky that it was you!

419
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:50,792
I«m always lucky.
- Yes, of course.

420
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:57,592
Well, life went on.
Also in the institute. You remember.

421
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,673
Strange.
Sometimes i was quite in a good mood.

422
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,551
Hey, Hoesch, come here.

423
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,592
Have a look at this.

424
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,193
 you can among all these germs...

425
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:19,751
remember 3 of them, or? Well,
give them a name then.

426
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:25,153
Call the first Colonel Winkler,
the second Hoesch and the third Rothe.

427
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,196
That«s easy, or?

428
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,990
but if you inject a single winkler, Hoesch or Rothe,

429
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:36,073
in the blood of a healthy body,
he«ll go ill.

430
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:39,150
He«ll die like a dog.

431
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:45,828
By the way, when i did take your
eyepiece out of the desk drawer

432
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:48,514
Is it yours?
- Yes.

433
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:53,958
Nice. You don«t have to get so close
to the patient to give an injection.

434
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:58,876
Is it here to indicate our personal
relationship?

435
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:02,873
No, it«s always there.
These things make the suite baggy.

436
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:06,873
My connections are good for some cigarettes,
but a new suite...

437
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,669
I also don«t get one without a special paper

438
00:46:10,760 --> 00:46:14,753
Doctor? Do you take me with you?
- I did promise it.

439
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,673
Good bye, Doctor.
- Come.

440
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:00,199
Good evening.

441
00:47:02,280 --> 00:47:03,759
Good evening.

442
00:47:04,480 --> 00:47:09,190
Excuse me.
Is this your seat?

443
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,068
Yes, that«s my seat.
- Excuse me.

444
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,559
No problem.

445
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:27,830
by the way may name is Rothe, Karl.
- Ursula. I am Ursula.

446
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,598
Ursula. That«s a nice name.

447
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:34,319
Ursula how?
- weber. Ursula weber.

448
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:38,389
i live here since today.
- you live here?

449
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:43,549
It«s no my fault.

450
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:50,190
Am i on the right seat now?
- No, that«s Mrs Hermanns seat.

451
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:54,353
Please stay, she won«t come for dinner 
anyway

452
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:58,353
Maybe you want to pour me
some tea. - You«re welcome.

453
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,273
She always does that.

454
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:04,352
Here«s your cup.
- Thank you.

455
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:10,553
Your letter. Do you want to read it?
- No, better not.

456
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,594
(Knocking)
Yes, please.

457
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:34,678
Pardon my intrusion.

458
00:48:34,880 --> 00:48:35,869
Terrible.

459
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:41,194
The pen must work
It«s important.

460
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,353
I have to write some letters.
- That«s important.

461
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,036
I hate writing letters.
I always slide it back.

462
00:48:50,280 --> 00:48:54,273
I hope you don«t mind.
- No, not at all.

463
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:58,112
It«s nice here. So many books.

464
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:02,558
I«m sure you like reading.

465
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,153
I don«t think writing letters is real
work.

466
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:15,233
You surely have important things to do?
- Yes, very important.

467
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:20,070
I do disturn. I knew it.
I always have the wrong seat.

468
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:24,472
My mother alwys told me:
"Ursel, you have two left hands"...

469
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:27,508
and two left legs.

470
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:30,952
Really.
I can«t see them.

471
00:49:33,800 --> 00:49:37,839
Are you from Hamburg?
- No, i«m from Gšrlitz.

472
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:40,912
I was transfered.

473
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,433
I«m a teacher at the
Einspšttler school.

474
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:49,513
You«re very young.
- There are some nowadays,

475
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:53,997
who are much younger.
You«re also not from Hamburg?

476
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:00,633
You surely know many people here.

477
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,475
Then you don«t realize.
- what?

478
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,151
My talk does disturb you.
- No, not at all. Sit down.

479
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,517
Do you want some coffee?
- real coffee?

480
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:18,112
Not quite,
but... almost.

481
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:20,269
Yes.

482
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:24,189
Here you are.
- Thank you.

483
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:31,069
It«s strong.

484
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:33,114
Special ration? 

485
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,552
No, i have good connections.
But you only get one cup.

486
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:42,668
Otherwise you«ll have two pair a left 
hands and legs. - For sure.

487
00:50:46,320 --> 00:50:50,916
Since when do you live here?
- About two years.

488
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:56,152
I did see Mrs Hermann
for the second time,

489
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:00,916
but that i can tell you:
i don«t like here much.

490
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:07,193
Yes, i know.
But life goes on.

491
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,631
At first i didn«t want to move in,
then i told to myself:

492
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,919
The room can«t be empty.
That«s superstition, or?

493
00:51:18,480 --> 00:51:20,072
Yes.

494
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:25,472
why did she kill herself?

495
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:35,112
i mean she was 24. I«m 22,
i couldn«t do that.

496
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:41,549
Well... what do you get out of life when
you«re young?

497
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,916
Here«s your pen.
- thank you.

498
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:53,237
how can i return this favor?
Oh yes!

499
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:58,519
My mother did send me gingerbread.
Selfmade and fresh!

500
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,431
(Music)

501
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,431
(Music)

502
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,431
(Music)

503
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:54,153
(Woman) There«s a bar,
they have liquor.

504
00:53:57,800 --> 00:54:01,793
Money first.
- Come, you can count on me.

505
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:05,993
Stop it. Go home,
you«re full. I«m no bank.

506
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:09,868
Here«s the money. Here.
- Dog leather is great.

507
00:54:09,960 --> 00:54:13,919
My wife made a bag out of it.
- Dog leather? no.

508
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,471
That«s nothing.
They make lady slippers out of fishes.

509
00:54:20,120 --> 00:54:25,114
It has to be one with a short fell
otherwise it looses hair.

510
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:30,713
Don«t you see that the fellow isn«t 
interested in woman?

511
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:35,157
Go away! he pesters people when
he«s drunk

512
00:54:35,360 --> 00:54:39,876
I hardly know him. 

513
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:43,396
She dosn«t know me.
- This is not a good bar.

514
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:47,473
I like it.
- I«m not often here.

515
00:54:47,600 --> 00:54:52,515
Do we leave or have another drink?
- I have to leave. Another drink for the lady.

516
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:58,473
Something«s the matter with you.
- Nothing important.

517
00:54:58,600 --> 00:55:03,196
One can«t be always in swing
You don«t have to be afraid of me.

518
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:05,271
I«m not afraid.

519
00:55:08,080 --> 00:55:12,073
Don«t talk bullshit when i«m with a 
client.

520
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,912
She doesn«t know me.
- Closing time!

521
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:24,232
She didn«t think that someone bites.
- time that you get a hold.

522
00:55:25,640 --> 00:55:26,629
Well yeah.

523
00:55:34,520 --> 00:55:36,511
(Music)

524
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,111
So, here«s my room.

525
00:55:52,040 --> 00:55:54,918
The switch is behind you.

526
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,068
Turn on the light.

527
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:04,352
You«re funny. do you want to stay in front 
of the door in darkness?

528
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:10,392
Hey, what«s wrong with you?

529
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:21,275
Damn!

530
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:25,708
That«s who you are.

531
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:30,759
I knew it.

532
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:32,629
Murderer!

533
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:39,434
Murderer!

534
00:56:40,000 --> 00:56:41,797
Murderer!

535
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:43,873
Murderer!

536
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,839
Murderer!

537
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:48,350
Help! Help!

538
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,079
Police!

539
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:52,551
Help! Murderer!

540
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:55,234
Light! Turn on the light!

541
00:56:55,960 --> 00:56:57,757
Police!

542
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:03,758
My keys! Police!
- Why the shouting?

543
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:10,590
There is a many on my door!
- Aren«t you used to this?

544
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:14,673
No, it«s a murdere.
A murderer! A killer!

545
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:19,993.
I tell you, there«s a killer.

546
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:23,556
A killer.
I just looked him in the eyes,

547
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:27,713
and i noticed how he stares.

548
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,759
Alarm?
- No but on the fifth floor...

549
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:36,758
Can you see something?
Maybe in the attic?

550
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,309
werner!

551
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,834
werner, please come out.

552
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,753
Excuse me.
It«s a bit embarrasing

553
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:59,432
Well. Poor girl, nothing to eat...

554
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:03,593
Had a few drinks,
a few too many. Unfortunately.

555
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:13,989
why didn«t you ask who he is?
- She always has trouble with the guys.

556
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:20,917
Good evening.
- Good evening.

557
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,073
Excuse me,
what did you do to her?

558
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:31,110
Nothing. I only payed the liquor
That is no crime, or?

559
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:35,751
She would deserve to get beaten, though.

560
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:39,833
Don«t get beaten!

561
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:43,993
Pretending you were...
You «re just drunk 

562
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:48,113
and you«re always drunk

563
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:51,589
Damn, my keys.

564
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:56,675
no, that«s a murderer.

565
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,713
Yes... now i know.

566
00:59:00,640 --> 00:59:03,632
I didn«t had the guts to believe

567
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:08,798
and she did shout at me:
"Murderer. "

568
00:59:10,360 --> 00:59:14,353
But i was save.

569
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,838
I wanted to go home.

570
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,354
Wait, i have to go with you!
Stop!

571
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,792
(mumbling)

572
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:45,912
I thought i«ll miss it.
That«s the last one, or?

573
00:59:46,000 --> 00:59:49,834
Yes, the last one.

574
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:55,995
I have to go to terminal.
We have been bobed out in Rothenburg.

575
00:59:59,480 --> 01:00:01,471
(Singing)

576
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,913
Do you have a light?
- we have to get off.

577
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:10,152
So, you can go to your seat now.

578
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,718
Give me a light.

579
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:23,033
I know you. I don«t know where from
but i know you.

580
01:00:23,160 --> 01:00:26,152
That«s funny, i know this face.

581
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,114
Are you from Uelzen?

582
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:36,070
I know him. That«s true.
Have you been to Sterkerode?

583
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:40,513
No.
- Come into the light.

584
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,992
leave him alone,
he doesn«t know you, right?

585
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,277
Of course he doesn«t know me

586
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:53,070
I«m just a little man, nobody
knows the little man.

587
01:00:54,360 --> 01:00:57,238
But i, i know you.

588
01:00:58,680 --> 01:01:01,069
Do you know me?
- No.

589
01:01:01,160 --> 01:01:05,153
He doesn«t know me, she doesn«t know me, 
nobody knows me.

590
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:09,749
So, do you know me?
- No.

591
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:11,959
there you have it.

592
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,838
Nobody knows me. there you have it.

593
01:01:35,880 --> 01:01:39,873
I didn«t know that the train is 
heated.

594
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:48,672
Pardon, they aren«t so luxurious in the
fifth year of war.

595
01:01:49,560 --> 01:01:52,552
Now i know where you are from.

596
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:58,509
Sure, if you don«t want to talk to me.

597
01:01:59,360 --> 01:02:02,591
Do what you want.

598
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:07,238
Young lady, do you know me?

599
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,112
terrible such an vulgar man.

600
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:21,153
Look. Nice, or?
Do you want too?

601
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,272
Yes, that«s nice.

602
01:02:28,080 --> 01:02:32,596
I did queue up one hour for this.
There are no toys for the kids.

603
01:02:32,680 --> 01:02:36,229
I also have two kids,
two boys.

604
01:02:36,320 --> 01:02:40,313
It«s not easy,
in the war without a husband.

605
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:47,113
My husnband Heinz is since '38
in the army.

606
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,431
6 years.
- A long time.

607
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,074
I feel hot!

608
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:59,717
Yes and he comes for 8 days vacation
each year. That isn«t much.

609
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:06,796
What do you want now?

610
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:10,913
Don«t you see that i talk to this man?

611
01:03:11,000 --> 01:03:14,117
It could be a mistake but...

612
01:03:14,200 --> 01:03:19,194
Leave me alone!
- I have seen these eyes once.

613
01:03:19,280 --> 01:03:23,273
Don«t make trouble here!
- Can«t be a mistake

614
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:30,118
I know these eyes...
- Leave me alone!

615
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:33,394
Take it easy.

616
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:41,196
How pushy some people are.
Doesn«t he realize that you don«t know him?

617
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:46,559
Of course i don«t know him.
- How should somebody like you know such a person?

618
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,279
(air-raid warning)
There we have it! Alarm!

619
01:03:49,360 --> 01:03:52,955
air-raid warning!
All to the bunker.

620
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:05,558
We have to leave
or we have to stand.

621
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:09,993
I«ll stay.
(conductor) Anybody in here? 

622
01:04:15,040 --> 01:04:20,558
Right. if you get it,
you get it.

623
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:35,436
we move.

624
01:04:35,920 --> 01:04:40,311
out of the station.
we move.

625
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:32,753
you know, i was very frightened
in the past

626
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:35,639
but not anymore.

627
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:39,713
because you don«t live anymore if 
you are always frightened.

628
01:05:39,800 --> 01:05:42,792
I«m not frightened anymore.

629
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,151
(Music)

630
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,993
Can i have a light?

631
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,431
(Music)

632
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,039
Can i have a light?

633
01:06:40,480 --> 01:06:42,277
(Music)

634
01:06:52,640 --> 01:06:54,631
(Scream)

635
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:58,831
(all-clear)

636
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,071
(mumbling)

637
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:53,109
(conductor)
All aboard! All aboad!

638
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,112
Departure!

639
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:31,791
My escape was in vain.
I wasn«t escaped.

640
01:08:32,320 --> 01:08:36,598
I didn«t want to,
but still did do it.

641
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:43,077
And i walked through the night.
Blind, deaf... and lost.

642
01:08:57,640 --> 01:09:02,589
I only had one wish.
To sleep.

643
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:07,151
But when i came home,
somebody already slept there.

644
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:14,030
Mrs Hermann, her cat on her lap.
Why didn«t she go to bed?

645
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:18,113
Because she awaited me with her dreadful
care.

646
01:09:27,560 --> 01:09:31,553
Dear heaven, i fell asleep.

647
01:09:36,840 --> 01:09:40,913
Some more, Karl?
I didn«t had any luck in PoppenbŸttel.

648
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:46,229
Half a pound butter and two breads.
Half a pound!

649
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:50,795
Did you hear Karl?
- Did i hear what?

650
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:54,589
I didn«t ask for anything.
- i just...

651
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:58,639
I didn«t want to disturb you.
- You never want to disturb me.

652
01:09:58,720 --> 01:10:03,430
I«ll make you something.
- I didn«t ask for anything.!

653
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:08,276
Pssh, we«re no alone here.
- Yes, you«re right.

654
01:10:08,760 --> 01:10:12,639
Inge is right.
One suffocates here!

655
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:16,550
Yes.

656
01:10:17,720 --> 01:10:18,869
Yes, yes.

657
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:23,352
If only the cat has it«s milk.

658
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,119
Inge?

659
01:10:42,400 --> 01:10:45,790
I...
You always were very good to me.

660
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:51,158
Excuse me.
- Don«t.

661
01:10:54,960 --> 01:10:57,554
Do you have a cold?

662
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:08,513
I did see Mrs Hermann for the last time.

663
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:13,469
Suicide is cowardly.

664
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:18,076
There was no escape. I didn«t 
want you to get my work.

665
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:23,154
No, it should vanish with me.
That«s why i went into the Institute.

666
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,592
Then... i wanted to end it all.

667
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,114
Hey, you! Wake up!

668
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:35,198
Wake up, Wake up, Wake up!

669
01:11:35,280 --> 01:11:39,273
Damn you!
You can sleep long enough!

670
01:11:39,880 --> 01:11:43,873
Did you ever understand,
why i«m still alive, hm?

671
01:11:43,960 --> 01:11:46,838
because of an cigarette.

672
01:11:48,280 --> 01:11:52,751
At that time i wanted one, not now.
That«s why i«m still alive.

673
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,394
Anyway...

674
01:11:59,360 --> 01:12:04,639
All my documents and charts
everything burned.

675
01:12:05,440 --> 01:12:06,429
Finished.

676
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:11,433
All i wanted then was a cigarette.

677
01:12:12,520 --> 01:12:18,197
And i didn«t had any.
But i remembered where i could find some

678
01:12:18,600 --> 01:12:21,592
In your desk drawer. Very simple.

679
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,798
I broke it. I found some.

680
01:12:26,480 --> 01:12:29,472
I also found some other things

681
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:32,712
Like these funny letters from Inge,

682
01:12:32,840 --> 01:12:36,958
which you showed to colonel Winkler

683
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:41,431
With one of those letters i did light up 
my cigarette. Yes...

684
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:47,359
Of course i took also something else.
I thought of you.

685
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:52,992
You should not survive,
Hoesch. No, no.

686
01:12:53,080 --> 01:12:57,710
The whole thing was mysterious.
The light of the radiation machine...

687
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,550
flickered every few seconds,
and i thought how i can get you.

688
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:07,391
A single time in my life in wanted to kill
with intention 

689
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,952
and i needed a gun.

690
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:22,510
Well...
These make baggy a suit baggy.

691
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,397
Yes, yes.

692
01:13:24,520 --> 01:13:27,432
That was clear - you had to go with me.

693
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:30,910
But where were you?
I had to think quick.

694
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:35,716
I saw the official car outside.
I was looking for you. At home, in the office,

695
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:40,558
Finally at Winkler. I had some business
with him anyway

696
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:45,031
No, i was looking for you.
I did hear from your visit.

697
01:13:45,200 --> 01:13:49,478
You weren«t at home.
I found that funny.

698
01:13:49,640 --> 01:13:54,111
Then i went to the lnstitute.
I knew it all along.

699
01:13:54,280 --> 01:13:58,751
And there i found your traces.
The whole mess in the washbasin,

700
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:04,198
my broken drawer. Notes gone,
revolver gone. Then i realized!

701
01:14:07,000 --> 01:14:11,391
You asked for Winkler in the office.
So i thought you were there.

702
01:14:11,520 --> 01:14:16,355
(Rothe) Right. I drove there.
(Hoesch) It didn«t matter in this moment.

703
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:21,600
I wanted tokill you.
You with my gun... very embarassing.

704
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:25,919
But i had no time for you.
Duty first.

705
01:14:26,080 --> 01:14:30,073
We had  alert stage 9 this evening.
Big deal!

706
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:34,990
A general Hauff was arested.
In Berlin. He talked.

707
01:14:35,280 --> 01:14:40,877
He also had his allies in Hamburg.
All swells. but where?

708
01:14:40,960 --> 01:14:45,795
Without you i woudn«t have find out.
But thanks to you it was my big evening!

709
01:14:45,880 --> 01:14:50,556
Only thanks to you. You showed me the way

710
01:14:54,160 --> 01:14:56,151
Parole Babylon.

711
01:14:59,640 --> 01:15:03,872
The whole story did sound like 
a detective novel. I laughed.

712
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:09,034
Now in knew the trick and
i dared to go into this strange world.

713
01:15:09,640 --> 01:15:12,552
Because i thought you were there.

714
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,431
Parole Babylon.

715
01:15:33,320 --> 01:15:37,313
This way, please.
You can leave your coat here.

716
01:15:37,400 --> 01:15:40,995
May i smoke?
- Oh, no problem.

717
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:43,997
Babylon...

718
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:49,669
It worked. I was in the house, 
in a strange mood.

719
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:53,753
Like a boy.
Like a boy who played hide and seek.

720
01:15:53,880 --> 01:15:57,759
Of course i thought that
you were in the room next door, Hoesch.

721
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:01,753
(Hoesch) That was a mistake, 
Doctor.

722
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:05,833
(Winkler) Now the best: Do you know
where we hide the poison?

723
01:16:05,960 --> 01:16:08,872
I don«t get it,

724
01:16:08,960 --> 01:16:14,193
why should the bosses have the heroic death
in their pockets?

725
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:17,272
(laughter)
(Man) "To the heroic death in the pockets".

726
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:20,511
Don«t laugh.

727
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:25,077
I don«t have to remind you that we are all in danger
after Hauff«s arrest.

728
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:30,234
If he would have had the poison,
We«d know if our names are known.

729
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:37,551
who could stand a questioning in the
Prinz-Albrecht-street?

730
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:44,192
With the effective methods of our dear
Hoesch? No thanks!

731
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:51,753
No, i honestly prefer my 08er for suicide.

732
01:16:51,840 --> 01:16:54,832
It worked fine so far.

733
01:16:55,160 --> 01:17:00,314
(Rothe) i made a mistake.
You couldn«t belong to them, Hoesch.

734
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,872
See, see. Winkler,
i was wrong i about him.

735
01:17:05,960 --> 01:17:09,873
He is a very receptive person.

736
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:14,556
I find this panic a bit hysteric
- No time for feelings here.

737
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:18,673
In our situation our private affairs are quite
silly.

738
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:22,839
We have to act immeditately.
Who knows how much time we have left.

739
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,469
Marquart, you leave tonight as a
messenger.

740
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,154
Thank you, Colonel.
(phone)

741
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:34,195
The car from Bremen waits at 5 o«clock
aat the SeegartenbrŸcke.

742
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:38,273
What«s going?
Why does no one answer the phone?

743
01:17:39,680 --> 01:17:41,477
Yes, hello?

744
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:46,553
Hoesch? What«s going on?
Can«t this wait until tomorrow?

745
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:51,594
dear heaven, my wife is seriously ill!
You know that! what? who?

746
01:17:52,160 --> 01:17:55,152
Dr. Rothe?
No, Dr. Rothe isn«t here.

747
01:17:56,400 --> 01:18:00,393
Yes, Colonel, i«m here.
Good evening. - Good evening.

748
01:18:01,680 --> 01:18:06,834
Are you crazy? What«s Dr. Rothe
doing here in the middle of the night?

749
01:18:09,000 --> 01:18:13,516
What on earth do you want?
Why did you get in?

750
01:18:13,600 --> 01:18:16,068
Very simple. Babylon.

751
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:27,112
What? He stole the gun?
He must be crazy.

752
01:18:27,200 --> 01:18:29,191
No, no, here.

753
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,992
Yes, i«m listening. Give it to me.
You«re too nervous.

754
01:18:34,080 --> 01:18:37,072
But i need it later.

755
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:43,233
Yes, of course i«m listening. What«s going on?
You did send two officers?

756
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:49,837
You«re worried about my security?
Very nece but i«ll see you tomorrow!

757
01:18:51,120 --> 01:18:55,796
of all people Hoesch.
That goes to your account. - Yes, Yes.

758
01:18:56,040 --> 01:18:59,271
Why are you here?
- Very simple.

759
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:04,150
I came to shot Hoesch. 
And you. - And?

760
01:19:04,520 --> 01:19:08,513
Now i don«t want to shoot you anymore
- Very nice.

761
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:12,792
Lilly, Hoesch did send two officers.
Let them in.

762
01:19:12,880 --> 01:19:16,793
Without password! They don«t belong to us.
(doorbell)

763
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,949
There they are.

764
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:24,511
You caused some trouble.
- You too caused some trouble once for me.

765
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:28,753
If it«s against Hoesch,
i«m with you.

766
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:35,872
There we are Colonel.
- Good evening.

767
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:41,114
One moment. I have a visitor,
Dr. Rothe, please.

768
01:19:41,400 --> 01:19:45,393
Yes, thank you.
- Next door. Enjoy yourself.

769
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:05,628
(Rothe) Nothing could be done.
There was an alarm in the next moment.

770
01:20:06,360 --> 01:20:09,591
(air-raid warning)
Damn.

771
01:20:10,120 --> 01:20:12,998
It was very dramatic.

772
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:17,233
Here your tracker dogs, 
and over there the accomplices.

773
01:20:17,480 --> 01:20:21,189
But there were even better things..

774
01:20:21,280 --> 01:20:25,273
The head of state was kidnapped by
paratroopers.

775
01:20:25,400 --> 01:20:29,598
A Minister escaped by plane
I don«t know what else.

776
01:20:29,720 --> 01:20:33,759
What else i«ll go through this night,
Is almost harmless compared to this.

777
01:20:33,800 --> 01:20:37,759
Winkler had a plan.
The ambulance was standing by,

778
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:41,719
to bring his wife into the hospital.
Instead of her he decided

779
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:45,793
to smuggle oout the messenger
and to fool the officers.

780
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,872
(Hoesch)
but my officers weren«t fooled.

781
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:53,033
Especially thin MŸller

782
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:56,948
The story get more funny.
- Yes.

783
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,952
(Hoesch)
And then you saw something.

784
01:21:14,320 --> 01:21:18,313
I«ll try to call Hoesch.

785
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:22,791
(Rothe) Winkle and hie friends didn«t had a 
clue.

786
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:27,596
An the hours went by.
and then i fell asleep.

787
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:35,673
It was dawn. The city still
was hoping for sounding of the all-clear.

788
01:21:35,760 --> 01:21:40,356
Winkler didn«t want to waint longer
His friends left the house one by one.

789
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:44,433
(Hoesch) we were faster!
When the air-raid was coming to an end,

790
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:47,552
i already took all precautions.

791
01:21:55,120 --> 01:21:59,113
(Winkler) Dr. Rothe, it«s time.
- I«m not a murderer.

792
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:05,553
Pardon.
I didn«t sleep for a long time.

793
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:13,438
broken crockery brings luck.

794
01:22:13,840 --> 01:22:16,434
Yes, i«m ready.

795
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:39,109
Moment. Farewell, Marquart.
Everything will be allright.

796
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:43,837
Yes, Elisabeth, it«ll be allright
In 4 weeks everything will be over.

797
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:47,913
Doktor, let«s go.
Nurse, thank you.

798
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:54,790
(Hoesch) The house was surrounded.
We did get them one by one.

799
01:22:54,880 --> 01:23:00,000
Only the main allies were missing.
But what was that with the ambulance?

800
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:05,070
I did let him go at first.

801
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:09,756
I saw the whole thing from the otherside
Then the hunt was on!

802
01:23:11,360 --> 01:23:13,351
(Music)

803
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:40,551
(siren)

804
01:23:58,040 --> 01:24:00,031
(Music)

805
01:24:15,320 --> 01:24:18,312
Something must have happend.

806
01:24:19,040 --> 01:24:22,032
Why isn«t the car here?

807
01:24:24,040 --> 01:24:26,952
(siren)

808
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:45,433
Damn.

809
01:24:59,480 --> 01:25:01,471
(Music)

810
01:25:29,000 --> 01:25:31,992
You, to the left! three men to the left!

811
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,514
Stop!

812
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:59,155
(Rothe). That«s how it looks when 
grown-ups play hide and seek.

813
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:03,593
but when i turned around 
Colonel Winkler was gone.

814
01:26:04,280 --> 01:26:09,798
He left his gun, without saying good bye

815
01:26:11,280 --> 01:26:15,398
But his final words,
i remember exactly.

816
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:18,995
He said: "For Hoesch".

817
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:26,429
They must not find it here with me!

818
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:31,873
I woud have been easier for Winkler.

819
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:33,315
Why?

820
01:26:33,520 --> 01:26:37,513
He would have brought this to an end.

821
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:42,077
What do you think what he had to tell us

822
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:46,552
I thought he...
- I just said so.

823
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:56,319
Hi didn«t! We got him.
When he escaped to swiss.

824
01:26:56,400 --> 01:27:01,315
We did hang him,
The colonel winkler.

825
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:07,077
We didn«t look for you anymore.
You were dead for us.

826
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:12,754
And here you are.
Yes.

827
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:17,510
I tell you, you are always lucky.
Doctor, admit it!

828
01:27:18,280 --> 01:27:19,269
Well.

829
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,594
Unbelievable.

830
01:27:23,360 --> 01:27:27,558
The bomb night was over,
thousands were dead.

831
01:27:28,840 --> 01:27:34,517
Thousands who wanted to live.
But i, i was still alive.

832
01:27:38,520 --> 01:27:39,919
Unbelievable.

833
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:44,915
Again i only had one wish:
back home.

834
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:51,397
but when i came to 
Magdalenenstreet...

835
01:27:56,640 --> 01:27:59,632
There was no Magdalenenstreet anymore..

836
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:32,353
Anybody home? Can you do me a favor?

837
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:37,031
Can you read that?
I can«t. fume poisoning.

838
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:41,113
And please write:
" at Zillich".

839
01:28:42,000 --> 01:28:47,950
We now live in Hollstock.
My wife and i did loose everything.

840
01:28:48,560 --> 01:28:50,198
everythings lost.

841
01:28:50,600 --> 01:28:55,116
Do you know what happened to Mrs Herrmann?

842
01:28:55,400 --> 01:29:00,190
All gone!
Mrs Herrmann, Mrs weber, Dr. Rothe.

843
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:04,916
It«s their own fault. Why didn«t they go
in the bunker?

844
01:29:05,000 --> 01:29:08,993
Yes, it«s their own fault.

845
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,873
Well, Dr. Rothe was dead
without dying.

846
01:29:32,280 --> 01:29:36,273
At that time it was easy to get papers.

847
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:39,193
So i became Dr. Neumeister.

848
01:29:39,280 --> 01:29:42,875
Doctor
in the refugee camp Elbe-Düvenstett.

849
01:29:43,720 --> 01:29:47,429
Well. I maybe thought,

850
01:29:47,560 --> 01:29:52,793
that the past was buried in the
ruins of Magdalenenstreet.

851
01:29:54,000 --> 01:29:58,516
until you came here this afternoon, to vaccinate.

852
01:30:00,280 --> 01:30:03,875
Then i realized that there is no
leaving behind.

853
01:30:04,320 --> 01:30:07,357
There is no. It doesn«t work.

854
01:30:07,720 --> 01:30:12,350
I don«t have time to get excited! 
Don«t you understand?

855
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:16,673
one has to know one«s stuff.
And know when the right time to jump is.

856
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:21,988
I did always manage to jump at the right time.

857
01:30:22,840 --> 01:30:27,914
What do i care for? For you,
winkler, üfor lnge Hermann, üfor me?

858
01:30:28,760 --> 01:30:32,753
That«s nonsense.
It«s all nonsense.

859
01:30:33,280 --> 01:30:36,875
You don«t have the guts,
you amateure.

860
01:30:36,960 --> 01:30:39,793
You are not able to shoot.

861
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:42,838
Maybe i can.

862
01:30:43,360 --> 01:30:46,238
Jump now.

863
01:31:07,600 --> 01:31:09,591
That«s yours.

864
01:31:14,400 --> 01:31:17,278
They are yours too.

865
01:31:20,520 --> 01:31:22,511
(Music)

866
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:03,951
(Musik)

867
01:32:56,480 --> 01:32:58,471
(Music)
