1
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,878
THE THIRD PART OF THE NIGHT

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,557
<i>And the first angel sounded the trumpet and</i>
<i>there followed hail and fire mingled with blood...</i>

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,118
<i>... and the third part of the trees was burnt up</i>
<i>and all green grass was burnt up.</i>

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:23,952
<i>The second angel sounded the trumpet</i>

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,470
<i>and as it were a great mountain</i>
<i>burning with fire was cast into the sea</i>

6
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:30,873
<i>and the third part of the sea became blood.</i>

7
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:35,239
<i>And the third part of those creatures died</i>
<i>which had life in the sea</i>

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,795
<i>and the third part</i>
<i>of the ships was destroyed.</i>

9
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,389
<i>And the third angel sounded the trumpet</i>
<i>and a great star fell from heaven</i>

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,237
<i>burning as it were a torch</i>

11
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,989
<i>and it fell on the third part of the rivers</i>
<i>and upon the fountains of waters.</i>

12
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:50,349
<i>And the third part of the waters</i>
<i>became wormwood.</i>

13
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,394
<i>And many men died of the waters</i>
<i>because they were made bitter.</i>

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,792
The fourth angel sounded the trumpet
and the third part of the sun was smitten

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,718
and the third part of the moon
and the third part of the stars

16
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:06,548
so that the third part of them was darkened
and the day did not shine for a third part of it

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,352
and the night in like manner.

18
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:17,315
Listen, how silent everything is!

19
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,670
Your father was right.
We'll be safe and comfortable here.

20
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,555
You'll get on your feet again quickly.

21
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,508
How did all this happen?

22
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,391
You were ill for six weeks.

23
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,916
You swelled up to a monstrous size

24
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,394
and then you got feverish
and lost consciousness.

25
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:41,880
When you began to walk again,
we came here.

26
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,319
Don't you remember?

27
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,239
I do remember.

28
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,758
Keep loving me, Michal.

29
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:53,598
I'm not the only one responsible
for what has happened.

30
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,353
You're older than me, more mature.
You should have given me better guidance.

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:07,999
The doctor said
you should go out for walks.

32
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,632
I'll help you to dress.

33
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,752
Why didn't my father come here?
I'm quite well now.

34
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,238
Your father doesn't speak to me.

35
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,159
Take Lukasz with you.

36
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,035
Look how handsome your daddy is.

37
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,119
How are you?

38
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,829
I'm fine.

39
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,512
Father, I still can't understand it.

40
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,109
She left him in a cruel way.

41
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,559
She let him die.

42
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:28,672
For a long time she didn't want to tell me
he was feeding lice.

43
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,909
Oh God, who does not lead us...

44
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,478
Oh, God, who allows the fragile to be killed
and who elevates blind hatred...

45
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:55,709
Oh, God, who allows cruelty to be propagated
and people to torment each other...

46
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:59,673
Oh, God, who elevates the most evil ones
and puts the whip into their hands...

47
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:03,918
Oh merciless God,
have no mercy upon us.

48
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:21,439
What are you doing here? You were supposed
to stay in the country for a month.

49
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,758
Helena is dead, so is my mother and Lukasz,
and the house in the country was burnt down.

50
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,034
How can I help you?

51
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:32,834
I won't be feeding lice any more.
I'll have plenty of time now to do lots of things.

52
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,030
If you want me,
I would like be of use to you.

53
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,551
Listen, it's not so simple.

54
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,717
We are underground, do you understand?
Orders and discipline.

55
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,636
Don't worry. I can take orders.

56
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,830
I think that now I can do nothing better
than follow orders,

57
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,598
to stop despairing.

58
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,673
You'll have to forget your name,

59
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,076
your father's and your mother's name
and you'll have just a pseudonym.

60
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,759
- What do you want to call yourself?
- Grizzly or Blind.

61
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:05,470
Deaf or Lame.

62
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,637
The man who will be your commander
is really blind.

63
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,389
Stay here.

64
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,909
Olek!

65
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:00,509
Olek!

66
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,111
What... What's happened to you?

67
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,394
I'm in labour.

68
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:09,113
There's nobody around. Please help me.

69
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,870
No, no, I'm not from the police.

70
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,275
You must run and save him.

71
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,517
We've been living here for only ten days.

72
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,559
I simply can't understand
why they've been after him.

73
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:50,030
Hot water is in the kitchen.

74
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:24,709
Help me.

75
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:24,914
Lukasz...

76
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,752
I've been quick, haven't I?

77
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,875
I'm not yet ready.
I'm not yet prepared for it.

78
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,309
This isn't the time for me
to become a father.

79
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,759
I'm from the municipal insurance office.

80
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,789
Helena!

81
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,229
I insure apartments against fire.

82
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:25,996
Helena!

83
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:30,272
The insurance is, in fact, compulsory.
In case of an accident we pay...

84
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:31,355
Helena!

85
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,159
Perhaps I'll show you...

86
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,591
Listen, this gentleman says
he insures apartments against typhus.

87
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:40,200
Not against typhus but against fire.

88
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:44,433
I'm not sure whether
there is insurance against diseases.

89
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:48,268
The only fire that could have broken out
in this house died out a long time ago.

90
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,631
You shouldn't sit here in the darkness.

91
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:54,877
You should eat something.

92
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,272
My legs are itching.

93
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,835
I'm sorry to have disturbed you.
I think I'll be going.

94
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,114
I've got to call
at other apartments in this block.

95
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:24,559
- Do you make your living out of insurance?
- Yes.

96
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:28,229
Your attitude is too gentle.
You should shout at people.

97
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,151
Why?

98
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,469
Excuse me, I must help him.

99
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,317
It was me who found him his job.

100
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,718
Oh God, who deceiveth us,
make us know what we are doing.

101
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:40,755
My wife looked exactly like you.

102
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,478
But she is dead.

103
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,957
My father took us to an old country house
because I was very ill.

104
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,111
By us I mean Helena, Lukasz and me.

105
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:54,189
I left them wrapped up in bed coverings
because it was cold.

106
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,909
But I'll go back there when it's safe.

107
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,997
You see, I've never known
whether I'm important or unimportant,

108
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:10,238
whether I'll die for somebody's sake
or they'll die for mine.

109
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,910
People move on orbits
that are so distant from each other.

110
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:18,315
They encounter each other so rarely

111
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:22,911
and when they do, they often aren't those
who should've been brought together.

112
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:29,119
It sometimes happens in the midst of a war,
among lice, blood and muck.

113
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,393
I could have told them it was me they wanted,
that your husband wore an overcoat like mine.

114
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,830
But they've wounded him
and they wouldn't release either him or me.

115
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,797
Father, I would like
to leave these things with you.

116
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,797
May I take your old overcoat?

117
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,751
Take it by all means.

118
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:13,276
Shall we play a tune together?

119
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:32,837
Father, they were killed, weren't they?
I saw it myself, I haven't gone mad.

120
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,476
Yes, both of them were killed.
God rest their souls.

121
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,473
What did you say?

122
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:41,511
They were killed.

123
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:44,472
Your mother and your woman.

124
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,069
My woman? You won't even say her name.
You were a bad father-in-law to her.

125
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,793
Don't get melodramatic.

126
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:53,308
Well, I suppose I have the right to tell you

127
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,638
what I think of your personal affairs
for once in my lifetime.

128
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:02,313
You destroyed somebody's happiness
without giving a damn.

129
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:05,158
Even if it was only a superficial happiness.

130
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,634
You let that woman devour you.

131
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:12,515
When I arrived and saw
how the illness was eating you away,

132
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,552
how you were withering away,

133
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:19,070
I couldn't force myself
to be properly objective.

134
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:21,949
Father, I had nothing to give her

135
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:25,913
but the most despicable things
we have to offer.

136
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:26,949
What?

137
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,916
I feel that wherever she is,

138
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:35,509
alive or dead,
she expects something from me.

139
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,233
But she's dead.

140
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,269
That's a mystery.

141
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,311
You can't put it into words.

142
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,234
Stay with me, my son.

143
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,595
What for?

144
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,995
Father and son,

145
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:20,194
it's supposed to be bone of one's bone,
blood of one's blood,

146
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,758
and yet there's...

147
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:29,033
a wall, a wall, a wall.

148
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,871
Your request is preposterous.

149
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:49,315
Who is he anyway?
What can he tell them?

150
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,430
None of us really knows.

151
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:55,479
For the moment we should be happy
that you're alive.

152
00:28:56,680 --> 00:29:00,309
However, I'm still thinking about your request.

153
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,794
So many valuable people
have been arrested,

154
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,229
the very life blood of our nation,

155
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:07,714
and this man of yours
is somebody unimportant.

156
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:12,914
We haven't got enough strength
to put our hands into this vortex

157
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,076
just to draw out a nonentity.

158
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,270
And yet I can't help worrying about it.

159
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:22,229
I feel more and more strongly

160
00:29:22,280 --> 00:29:27,559
that we're sinking into a world
where all things have become alike.

161
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:32,153
Activity and non-activity,
cruelty and indifference.

162
00:29:33,320 --> 00:29:36,551
I cannot therefore give you an answer
according to my conscience.

163
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:41,792
There's one thing which is not clear. You said
you stayed part of the night in that apartment.

164
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:42,670
Yes.

165
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,516
Alone?

166
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,231
Yes.

167
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:48,829
Don't go back there
until you get further orders.

168
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,552
Don't come here either, please.

169
00:29:52,800 --> 00:29:54,313
I feel tired.

170
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,352
Please, leave me alone.

171
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:02,195
I'll try to give you an answer later.

172
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,589
Two zloties.

173
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:53,669
God bless you.

174
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,119
May I see Sister Klara?

175
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,076
Sister, may I see Olek's mother?

176
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,831
She's been very weak since yesterday.

177
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:17,113
She was restless in the night.
She called for me but she wouldn't talk.

178
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:22,029
Then she put her hand on her bosom
and said, "My son is dead".

179
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:26,676
- What did the doctor say?
- The doctors were taken away two months ago.

180
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:31,794
I am told they were taken to a nearby forest
and were poisoned with fumes on the way there.

181
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,829
How?

182
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:39,511
The exhaust pipes were fed
to the inside of the vans.

183
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:42,791
- You have a lot of technical knowledge.
- I've learnt somehow.

184
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:45,115
- Has Father ever visited you here?
- Never.

185
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:48,197
This irrational madness
seemed repulsive to him.

186
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:52,028
Live, my brother,
you who are so much alive.

187
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:09,155
Do you remember me?
I am Ginger's friend.

188
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,273
I mean Olek's, your son.

189
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:15,592
He asked me to come here
to say he is very busy.

190
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:20,559
He's doing nicely but not well enough
to take you away from this place.

191
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,833
He's very ashamed
that you have to stay here.

192
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,392
He asked me to tell you
he is thinking about you all the time,

193
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,276
and also to give you this little cross.

194
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,794
What are you doing?
You've frightened the old women.

195
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,876
You shouldn't be so violent.

196
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:16,398
You went to the Gestapo.
Why did they let you go twice?

197
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:19,716
I wasn't strong enough to give you
to them instead of him. I turned back.

198
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,433
You should feel happy that I was so weak.

199
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:26,268
Sister, she is so uncannily like Helena.

200
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:29,759
She isn't like her at all.
It's only your imagination.

201
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,392
I lived here, didn't I?

202
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:35,034
When they took Helena's husband away,

203
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,389
my sister found us shelter here.

204
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:40,396
Please go away and never come back.

205
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:44,797
The more silent he is, the more they beat him,
but he is silent as he knows nothing about you.

206
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,753
Don't you understand that every minute
I stay with you is a sin against him?

207
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:52,998
Now I know what I must do.

208
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,759
Go away, please.

209
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:56,994
Is it his child?

210
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:58,949
Ours.

211
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,673
It's his, yours...

212
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:04,518
and mine.

213
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:00,397
Why did you never come afterwards?

214
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,113
I didn't want to disturb you and him.

215
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,789
There is no me and him, only a shell,
something terrible corroded from within.

216
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,398
Why?

217
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:13,389
Because you can do anything to anybody.
Only the flesh is sick and all round you...

218
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,429
What?

219
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,395
Pity, kindness and faith cease to exist
when blood has been infected.

220
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,999
What does remain then?

221
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:24,639
Cruelty.

222
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:35,794
Before the war I studied law,

223
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:38,912
but when war broke out
it appeared I had no talents whatsoever,

224
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,916
that I could do nothing.

225
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,474
I was happy to get a job
at the insurance office.

226
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,636
- How old are you?
- 22.

227
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:48,389
You'll perish
if somebody doesn't put you right.

228
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,749
I'll give you a job
which will be the best for you.

229
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:53,394
What will I have to do?

230
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,954
Nothing. Just be patient.

231
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:59,197
I can do that.
Will we be working together?

232
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,959
Yes. Only I'll be the breeder.

233
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,155
When war broke out
my husband could do nothing either.

234
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:11,239
He tried to get a job at the post office.
I told him he should start feeding lice.

235
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:13,953
Before that happened
I thought I knew what love was.

236
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,399
What is love?

237
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:18,719
I don't know.

238
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:22,355
It is the opposite of cruelty,
a total contempt for all that isn't love.

239
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:25,553
That sounds dreadful.

240
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:29,149
No. It just means taking off the shield,
which in any case doesn't protect us.

241
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,714
To surrender yourself with the fear
that you may be rejected.

242
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:38,513
That hurts.

243
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,959
Feel my heart.

244
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,072
I can't feel like a grown-up man with you.

245
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:50,274
I can't be close to you without suffering.

246
00:37:38,080 --> 00:37:39,308
Marian!

247
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,920
Give me a letter of introduction
to your breeder.

248
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:45,236
I'm going back to feeding.
I must get better ration cards.

249
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,317
- Marmalade, bread and flour.
- There is nobody you need them for.

250
00:37:48,360 --> 00:37:51,432
Old man, it's now your turn
to make a confession.

251
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,996
Have you seen a miracle?

252
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,709
You would say that miracles
don't happen, wouldn't you, Marian?

253
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:03,436
You behave like... a wind. Those two worlds
can't be measured by the same yardstick.

254
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:07,473
One is a reflection of the other
and you yourself are the mirror.

255
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:10,239
You have the faith of a simpleton,
no matter what you say.

256
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:12,236
Listen, only you can understand me.

257
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,919
I'm not able to provide for anybody
in my present job.

258
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,155
Have you set up a family?

259
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,998
Yes. I've been blessed with one.

260
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,635
Do you realise how they infect us?

261
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,752
They fill themselves up with blood
and then they eject it.

262
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:36,429
They vomit it into little wounds
they have dug out

263
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,597
and only then
do they start sucking to the full.

264
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:00,678
This can't go on like that...

265
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:02,914
It's impossible.

266
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,512
There must be some law.

267
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:07,635
God.

268
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,516
It's time we talked with God.

269
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:15,396
A cry must burst out of this country's soul.

270
00:39:15,440 --> 00:39:19,228
Some appeal, some waves,
for if all this means nothing or only history,

271
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,840
- only a medieval darkness...
- Stop talking.

272
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,029
It means nothing.

273
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:26,795
The time that is to come
will be a time of despair

274
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:29,593
if the laws by which we're now governed
become established.

275
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,679
It's a crippling thought to remember
that the world was better at one time.

276
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:37,156
I'll give you a letter of introduction
and you can start feeding again.

277
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,558
Who do you want to see?

278
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,556
Mrs Wisniowska, on the first floor.

279
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:57,759
I've come to see you.

280
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,317
Are things as bad as that with you?

281
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,156
Yes.

282
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,794
Do you know
how many people try to get this job?

283
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,912
Yes, I know.

284
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:22,078
A slight temperature won't do them any harm.
In fact they like warm blood.

285
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:25,037
I'll give you a note for the doctor.

286
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:36,590
I've only just read your husband's book.

287
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,755
I wish you could tell him
that it's a very beautiful book.

288
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,190
It's beautiful, it's old.

289
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:45,752
It's many years old.

290
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:48,919
My husband is dead.

291
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:53,515
Have you ever seen
people dying of typhus?

292
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,429
Excuse me.

293
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,271
I'm going to register you as a patient.

294
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,991
And now I'll give you the first injection.

295
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:39,029
You'll be feverish for 24 hours.

296
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,069
I know.

297
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,077
You'll get the second injection in three days.

298
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,953
You'll then get the real vaccine, the illegal one.

299
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:50,229
Thank you.

300
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:57,269
I need two more vaccines
for a woman and a child.

301
00:41:57,920 --> 00:41:59,512
They should have come here.

302
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:03,511
As members of the feeder's family
they're entitled to it.

303
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,391
All right.

304
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,229
Hide it, quick.

305
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,391
This is the professor's private stock.

306
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:15,356
Thank you.

307
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,439
Enter this man on the list.

308
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,919
It's the best job you can find,

309
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,029
the best one.

310
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,799
Now when he's gone, his place is vacant.

311
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,276
I've brought food for her and the baby.

312
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:20,151
Could you give it to her?

313
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:22,839
I've put her in your old room.

314
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,278
No other accommodation is available
in the house or the convent.

315
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,878
It's dry and warm there

316
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,037
and if they look for her,
it would be difficult to find her there.

317
00:43:32,080 --> 00:43:36,232
Would you tell me, Sister,
would you explain to me, but don't deceive me,

318
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,635
does what has happened to me
make any sense?

319
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:41,592
Does it have some meaning
which I am unable to grasp?

320
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:43,949
Do you know
what these old people are dying of?

321
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,676
Of hunger, of cold and of lack of food.

322
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:51,439
Do you know how they die?

323
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:53,835
Sister, I have now got
good ration cards and food.

324
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,235
I can give you flour so you can eat your fill.

325
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,793
No, don't do that.

326
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,239
Go away please.

327
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:08,159
Sister, can't you see anything significant
in her likeness to Helena?

328
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,518
It's just that you can see
something which isn't there.

329
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,469
I've brought you some flour and potatoes.

330
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,190
You should eat well now.

331
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,435
I'll try to bring you something regularly.

332
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,868
I can leave the food at your door if you...

333
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,638
I've also brought a vaccine.

334
00:44:59,280 --> 00:45:01,316
You touched my blood.

335
00:45:01,360 --> 00:45:03,555
I was ill. My blood might have been infected.

336
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,192
I did it because I was frightened.

337
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:15,154
I'm scared of interrogations, of beatings,
I'm afraid I won't hold out,

338
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:16,758
of that what they may do to him.

339
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:21,432
They'll let him out after a time.

340
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:24,234
After what time?

341
00:45:28,440 --> 00:45:29,839
Your husband...

342
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:32,713
I would like to know who he was,

343
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:35,239
what he did?

344
00:45:37,200 --> 00:45:41,034
Before the war he wanted to be a lawyer.
He was a clerk at the district council for a year.

345
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:44,197
He started writing.
When I was pregnant he got a job here.

346
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,958
A good one?

347
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,513
It allowed us to live.

348
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,230
I also had a wife and a son

349
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:55,352
and we also lived here.

350
00:45:59,840 --> 00:46:01,478
Would you do me a favour?

351
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:05,274
Would you let me
hold your child for a moment?

352
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:05,029
Who are you?

353
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:07,670
You lived at my place at one time.

354
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:11,910
You were giving me tuition in literature
and I paid you with money.

355
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,188
Oh yes, I remember.

356
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:16,152
Later I let you dabble in trade,
rather a poor kind of trade.

357
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,758
Better than nothing.

358
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:20,792
It gives me great pain to see you back here.

359
00:47:20,840 --> 00:47:23,513
I thought you'd fared better in this world.

360
00:47:23,560 --> 00:47:25,994
You see, a carpet is only an object,

361
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:28,156
and so is a knick-knack
or a pair of shoes.

362
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:31,078
I understood that you didn't want
to pay with objects

363
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,680
but with what you yourself
had been created from.

364
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:36,996
What if I was unable to understand,
to protect myself?

365
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:39,600
You want to talk to God on equal terms.
It's impossible.

366
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:41,631
You should only ask him silent questions.

367
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:44,869
I've brought you a prophecy...

368
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:47,512
from your Bible.

369
00:47:47,560 --> 00:47:51,951
I've marked it down,
but don't read it now, only when I'm gone.

370
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,796
I've come to say goodbye.

371
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:55,829
Goodbye?

372
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,472
Yes, because I'm going away.

373
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:58,999
Now? Where to?

374
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:02,157
The Germans give passports
to wealthy people,

375
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,191
so they can go to Switzerland on the sly.

376
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:05,670
But...

377
00:48:06,760 --> 00:48:08,591
I've got one for myself and for my mother

378
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,393
but I must leave everything I have behind.

379
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,115
That isn't so dreadful
but the fact that I have to leave my son here...

380
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:18,835
I've got used to sneaking away
and visiting him night after night.

381
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:23,268
I wanted to talk to you for the last time
and somehow silence has descended upon us.

382
00:48:24,920 --> 00:48:29,391
You see, I believe that my son
will be waiting for me at the end of my road,

383
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:33,479
just as I believe that you must find
the woman you loved again.

384
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,829
Why are you still wearing a mask?

385
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:38,872
Because I'm afraid to look at my own face,

386
00:48:38,920 --> 00:48:41,753
because I'm afraid that the wind
may blow me out like a candle

387
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:43,392
just at the time of departure.

388
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,989
Goodbye, Mr Rozenkranc.

389
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:49,080
May the grace of God be with you.

390
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,270
"There appeared a wonder in heaven,

391
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:01,959
a woman clothed
with the sun and the moon under her feet.

392
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,675
And she being with child cried,
pained to be delivered.

393
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,995
And there appeared another wonder.

394
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,508
A dragon stood before the woman

395
00:49:10,560 --> 00:49:13,393
for to devour her child.

396
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:16,071
<i>And there was a war in heaven.</i>

397
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,918
<i>Michal and his angels fought the dragon.</i>

398
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:22,430
<i>And the great dragon was cast out.</i>

399
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:28,070
<i>The woman was given wings</i>
<i>that she might fly to the wilderness</i>

400
00:49:28,120 --> 00:49:31,556
<i>and be nourished</i>
<i>for a time and half a time.</i>

401
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:36,549
<i>And I stood upon the sand of the sea. "</i>

402
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,274
I've come to you, to you...

403
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,754
You can't stay here.
I must go there to help them.

404
00:51:21,960 --> 00:51:23,632
What about your husband?

405
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:27,116
Would you love me
if I deceived him even one day more?

406
00:51:37,360 --> 00:51:42,115
I never believed one might be fired with love
so unexpectedly and with such terrific power.

407
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:43,388
I wasn't ready for it.

408
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:45,715
I was, well, a kind of student.

409
00:51:47,400 --> 00:51:49,960
Father, what was my child like?
Silent or cheerful?

410
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:54,074
When Helena and I went out,

411
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:58,512
at that time he was too small
to stand in queues with us.

412
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,749
I used to put his hand on the arm
of a chair and say, "Wait here."

413
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,793
And when we returned after several hours
he was still standing there.

414
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:10,478
Lost in thought. What about?

415
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,876
Don't get annoyed.

416
00:52:13,920 --> 00:52:15,911
And that man?

417
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:18,838
You've never told me about him.

418
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,719
I think that the feeding humiliated him,

419
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:26,471
that he didn't, in fact, love anybody

420
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:31,389
and yet every day he had to give his blood
to something he hated more than anything else.

421
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:33,908
Later I saw him only once,

422
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,439
from a window.

423
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,789
They took him away. I saw it.
The crowd drove me into a stairway.

424
00:53:20,840 --> 00:53:22,319
- There was a round-up.
- Who?

425
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,793
Your husband.

426
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:28,191
- He's got good papers.
- I saw him tearing them up.

427
00:53:28,240 --> 00:53:28,990
Why?

428
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,271
I don't know. Perhaps he couldn't bear it
that you had left him.

429
00:53:32,320 --> 00:53:35,471
Perhaps he loved you and
everything you told me about him was a lie.

430
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,675
We must move from this place.

431
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:44,029
And you should never forget it's our child.

432
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,753
Ours. A feeder's job is now available.

433
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,394
If you want the child to stay alive
you must take this job.

434
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,431
Immediately.

435
00:53:51,480 --> 00:53:53,232
Why did he tear his papers up?

436
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:56,671
He didn't feed any longer at that time.

437
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:59,349
I understand that
he roamed the streets with no job,

438
00:53:59,400 --> 00:54:02,949
that he seemed
to be hungry and half mad.

439
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:03,671
And?

440
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:07,076
Before the war he was a physicist,
apparently a very able one.

441
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:10,157
You see, he used to beat her.
He turned her out of the house.

442
00:54:10,200 --> 00:54:11,952
She had nobody to turn to except me.

443
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,629
Tell me, my dear, what do you think
was more important?

444
00:54:15,680 --> 00:54:19,434
The force which drove that woman towards

445
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:23,598
the fulfilment of her biological animal urge
to procreate against all the odds?

446
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,997
Was this force more important than sacrificing
herself for a man who lived at her side,

447
00:54:28,040 --> 00:54:34,036
who suffered, who thought,
who loved and who needed her

448
00:54:34,080 --> 00:54:39,677
and who chose death when she left him?

449
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:42,518
Father, tell me, what is more important?

450
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:47,839
The things people sacrifice for each other
or the things they share and want to save?

451
00:54:47,880 --> 00:54:50,792
To save? Nothing can be saved.

452
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:54,591
The world has crumbled,
has got smashed, has vanished.

453
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,154
You must fathom the new laws
that govern this decay

454
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,432
and adjust yourself to them.

455
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,712
That's why you acted
in a correct but cruel way.

456
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,875
I can redeem anything I did,

457
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,480
even the presence
of our children in this world.

458
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:28,149
Hi.

459
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,519
Hello.

460
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:44,589
Good morning.

461
00:55:55,720 --> 00:55:56,914
Good morning.

462
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:44,269
10,000. They're strong and healthy.

463
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,995
You'll feed them for half an hour
until the breeding cycle is complete.

464
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:52,397
Then they'll be injected with typhus germs
which will be bred in their intestines.

465
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:56,909
Later the intestines will be specially processed
so as to obtain vaccine.

466
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,995
That's the best job you can get.

467
00:58:00,360 --> 00:58:05,115
It provides you with papers which protect you
against deportation, arrest and hunger.

468
00:58:05,160 --> 00:58:07,435
It's a loathsome job.

469
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:11,075
The others who are here
are in the same situation.

470
00:58:12,160 --> 00:58:14,754
They would perish
if they couldn't come here.

471
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:21,874
What's that?

472
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:24,439
Excrement of lice.

473
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:27,313
Every day I check it for bacteria

474
00:58:27,360 --> 00:58:30,670
and to find out whether
your blood has not made them ill.

475
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:49,150
You shouldn't scratch yourself.
They die from it.

476
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,556
Somebody's selling all his books.

477
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,478
Yesterday I saw invaluable books
in a second-hand bookshop.

478
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:58,796
- Works by Nietzsche, Céline, Spengler.
- What about Conrad?

479
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:01,638
- It's too late to read Spengler.
- It's too late to read.

480
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:06,356
I saw some beautiful volumes
of the encyclopaedia, richly illustrated.

481
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:07,833
And nobody wanted to buy them?

482
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:10,440
Somebody will.
It's a time for intensive reading.

483
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:13,040
You're wrong.
Books are read out of derision.

484
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:14,479
I don't agree with you.

485
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:18,991
The fate of non-existent people
has never been more important that it is now.

486
00:59:19,040 --> 00:59:24,637
When Balzac was dying he summoned
to his death bed a doctor he'd created himself.

487
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:28,878
When Proust was dying, he was worried
about one of his secondary characters.

488
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:31,480
He scratched alterations
with his nail on his blanket.

489
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,557
At the hour of his death
this was more important to him than reality.

490
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:37,637
But neither Balzac nor Proust died
of hunger or in a concentration camp.

491
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:40,194
Neither of them was rounded up
like a dog in the streets.

492
00:59:40,240 --> 00:59:42,800
That's why anything you write
won't be a masterpiece.

493
00:59:42,840 --> 00:59:45,559
One shouldn't write but look after children.

494
00:59:45,600 --> 00:59:49,036
You're talking rot.

495
00:59:49,080 --> 00:59:51,230
You'd better recite some poetry.

496
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:53,077
You, who know how to live...

497
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:54,473
My poem.

498
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,512
Not mine, my friend's.

499
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:02,591
Twice the moon his silver face had turned,
When I pitched the tents on the desert sand.

500
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,997
My wife with crying baby at her breast,
It's dead now, laid to rest.

501
01:00:07,040 --> 01:00:08,996
- And sons and daughters did...
- Stop it!

502
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:12,396
Please stop this talk.
You'll make them ill with your chatter.

503
01:00:12,440 --> 01:00:15,273
The injectors and controllers can tell
if anything's wrong.

504
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,596
They're biting awfully today
as if they hadn't eaten for weeks.

505
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:21,074
You're the worst feeders here.

506
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:24,157
You scratch yourselves
when nobody is looking and drink vodka.

507
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,953
We lose at least one litre of blood at one go.

508
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,989
Shut up!

509
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,230
No talking while feeding.

510
01:00:31,280 --> 01:00:33,316
Because the lice may get infected.

511
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:48,634
Do you remember
how they took the professors away?

512
01:00:50,120 --> 01:00:52,998
Scores of people
were driven away in lorries.

513
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:55,674
Where to?

514
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:07,874
You see, only lice are important

515
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,078
because they keep you alive.

516
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,910
You shouldn't harm or cheat them.

517
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:17,875
They're your mothers
carrying death in their intestines

518
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:21,799
and you are wet nurses to your own mothers,
feeding them with death.

519
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:26,279
Your time is up.

520
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:29,078
You can take them off.

521
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,039
- You shouldn't come so late.
- I can still make it.

522
01:01:51,080 --> 01:01:53,753
You're out of breath
and sweating all over.

523
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:57,918
I've taken up my job again.
I can infect everybody here with typhus.

524
01:01:57,960 --> 01:01:59,552
- They've been vaccinated.
- How?

525
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,716
Your vaccines are distributed to the doctors.

526
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:03,318
- How is she?
- She's well.

527
01:02:03,360 --> 01:02:06,670
She's slowly beginning
to forget about her husband.

528
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,196
Sister, you've never told me
how she got here.

529
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,479
One of our sisters met her in the street,
dragging her feet.

530
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,919
Do you remember which one?

531
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,552
I don't remember.

532
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:20,592
Why did you put her in my old room?

533
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,272
Won't you tell me?

534
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:32,951
"And there came an angel
saying unto me, come hither.

535
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:37,958
I will show thee the judgment
of the great whore

536
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:42,115
with whom kings
have committed fornication.

537
01:02:42,160 --> 01:02:45,835
And all men were drunk
with the wine of her fornication.

538
01:02:45,880 --> 01:02:48,155
So he carried me to the wilderness.

539
01:02:48,200 --> 01:02:52,239
And I saw a woman upon a scarlet beast,

540
01:02:52,280 --> 01:02:54,635
full of the names of blasphemy.

541
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:57,752
And the woman was arrayed in purple

542
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,791
decked with gold,
precious stones and gold,

543
01:03:02,840 --> 01:03:05,434
a golden cup in her hand,

544
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:11,993
full of abominations
and the filthiness of her fornication.

545
01:03:12,040 --> 01:03:17,114
Upon her forehead was a name:

546
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,354
Mystery."

547
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,152
You're deceiving me.

548
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:23,158
You know that feeding gives you a fever.

549
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,191
You know I can't find an answer myself.

550
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:28,070
You expect me to forget,
to humiliate myself,

551
01:03:28,120 --> 01:03:30,918
to say:
"Unfathomable are the ways of God."

552
01:03:31,480 --> 01:03:32,993
I only expect you to save...

553
01:03:33,040 --> 01:03:34,837
Who? Her? Myself?

554
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,472
Your soul.

555
01:03:44,680 --> 01:03:47,319
Have you been vaccinated as I asked?
It's important.

556
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:51,275
I've brought you some more ration cards.

557
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,633
What's the matter?

558
01:03:54,680 --> 01:03:56,989
Tomorrow they'll offer you
the infected ones.

559
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,598
It's a better and more stable job.

560
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,073
How do you know?

561
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,951
You've never done it before.

562
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,796
It was too awful for you.

563
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:06,478
Did my sister tell you this?

564
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:11,115
I must find him.

565
01:04:11,160 --> 01:04:12,878
I'll look for him in the prisons.

566
01:04:12,920 --> 01:04:14,672
I'm now strong enough to go out alone.

567
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:17,678
No, it's no use doing it
until I learn everything.

568
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:26,033
When I'm looking at you,
I feel I've got another chance to experience

569
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:29,436
what I've already experienced
in a wrong way...

570
01:04:32,200 --> 01:04:34,270
and what I didn't understand well.

571
01:04:34,320 --> 01:04:37,198
Love takes us unawares
and slips through our fingers like sand.

572
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:38,229
Or perhaps...

573
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:43,188
Perhaps there was no love in me,
back then.

574
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:07,636
I'm afraid of the strange circumstances
in which we always seem to meet.

575
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:24,398
Oh merciful God,

576
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:27,754
thou who knowest
that we sin out of weakness.

577
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:33,717
God, who sendeth us the scourge of love
in the time of plague.

578
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,437
God, who rules us blindly,

579
01:05:37,720 --> 01:05:42,191
don't leave us that
we may not be lost in your wrath.

580
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,313
I didn't want to feed infected lice.

581
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:56,477
I was afraid they would do to me
what they did to Helena's husband,

582
01:05:56,520 --> 01:05:58,238
that I would become a bad man.

583
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:01,673
Was it the lice who did it?

584
01:06:01,720 --> 01:06:04,678
Or perhaps the lack of love between them?

585
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:06,349
What?

586
01:06:06,960 --> 01:06:09,235
I'm feeding them well today.

587
01:06:09,280 --> 01:06:11,669
My blood is feverish and they like it.

588
01:06:12,200 --> 01:06:14,555
They get drunk and fall asleep in ecstasy.

589
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:19,551
Feverish blood has bubbles
and it fizzes like champagne.

590
01:06:33,200 --> 01:06:34,792
Are you feeling bad about it?

591
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,399
Do you understand what's happened?

592
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:40,590
This is only for you.

593
01:06:42,120 --> 01:06:43,997
I always think about all of you.

594
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,631
There's no us any longer.

595
01:06:50,320 --> 01:06:52,356
Time's up.

596
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,397
You may hand the cages back.

597
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:06,919
You've already had typhus
so you're immune.

598
01:07:07,600 --> 01:07:10,876
They need injectors
in the contagious diseases section.

599
01:07:10,920 --> 01:07:13,753
If you feed infected lice

600
01:07:13,800 --> 01:07:16,837
you'll get better ration cards,
better pay and it will be regular.

601
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,552
You can take it up right away.

602
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:34,597
I'll set up a family too.

603
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,514
Better than yours, much better.

604
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,430
I'll take them tomorrow
in exchange for your meat ration.

605
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:56,958
I've got plenty of blood.

606
01:08:03,400 --> 01:08:08,679
We've been breeding
the same family since 1918.

607
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:12,315
These are progeny
of the original breeding couple.

608
01:08:12,360 --> 01:08:16,433
Have you looked at them closely?
They're darker than the average ones.

609
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:22,669
Several years ago their vitality declined,
so they were crossbred with Abyssinian lice.

610
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,836
Have you been an injector before?

611
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:27,030
I've already been everything in this process.

612
01:08:27,080 --> 01:08:29,548
I've been here for only six weeks.

613
01:08:29,600 --> 01:08:34,594
The professor brought my husband here
from Poznan to save him from...

614
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:35,675
Death.

615
01:08:41,400 --> 01:08:43,834
If we set them free
they would die of hunger.

616
01:08:43,880 --> 01:08:46,519
They're bred in a hot house
and propagated in test tubes.

617
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,633
They've lost what people often lose -
their instinct for self-preservation.

618
01:08:50,680 --> 01:08:55,037
Between you and your child
they are a kind of pump drawing fresh blood.

619
01:08:58,440 --> 01:09:00,078
I haven't got a child now.

620
01:09:00,120 --> 01:09:03,112
I'm sorry.
I thought you'd set up a family again.

621
01:11:49,080 --> 01:11:51,469
Don't touch me.
You're feeding infected ones now.

622
01:11:51,520 --> 01:11:52,999
So? You've been vaccinated.

623
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:54,519
Look at your collar.

624
01:11:55,240 --> 01:11:58,516
It isn't blood that makes
this louse so red but germs.

625
01:11:58,560 --> 01:12:01,199
It's been infected with Rickettsia
and it's got fever.

626
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:05,233
Grizzly,
I must confess something to you.

627
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:10,555
You see, if they catch me,
I'd give everybody away.

628
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:13,478
I'd blow the whole institute to pieces.

629
01:12:14,520 --> 01:12:16,750
I'd tell them that scientists are hidden here,

630
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:20,076
that writers are feeding lice,
that they should be deported.

631
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:24,398
You see, nothing in my family
prepared me for this job.

632
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:28,592
My ancestors were thinkers, lawyers...

633
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:32,677
The lab assistants should sabotage it.

634
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:36,353
Vaccines should be made less effective.

635
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,594
The whole situation should
be brought to a conclusion,

636
01:12:39,640 --> 01:12:42,029
should be stretched to the breaking point,

637
01:12:42,080 --> 01:12:45,993
so that not a trace of submission
and baseness is left in us,

638
01:12:46,040 --> 01:12:50,591
even if this leads
to mass arrests and torture.

639
01:12:52,160 --> 01:12:56,153
Perhaps this extermination is like a plague,

640
01:12:56,200 --> 01:13:00,671
sent to make people realise
the meaning of their lives.

641
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:07,029
I'll be trembling for you
if ever anybody gets deep into your heart.

642
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:09,592
Would you do me a favour?

643
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:12,835
Wait at the bakery tonight.

644
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,875
Somebody's come
to carry out a death sentence.

645
01:13:15,920 --> 01:13:17,797
Hold a newspaper in your right hand.

646
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,399
Go there instead of me.

647
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,031
- Please...
- No one must see us talking.

648
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:05,674
But I must know the truth.
I saw you caught in a round-up.

649
01:15:05,720 --> 01:15:07,358
You tore your papers up, so...

650
01:15:07,400 --> 01:15:10,312
What of it?
You're surprised I'm alive? Are you?

651
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:11,349
I escaped.

652
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:13,789
You see...

653
01:15:15,240 --> 01:15:16,992
I don't remember much.

654
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:20,154
It was your fault that she left you.

655
01:15:20,200 --> 01:15:22,316
She said the lice had eaten you up from within.

656
01:15:22,360 --> 01:15:27,434
But no, it couldn't be like that.
You must have been like that before.

657
01:15:27,480 --> 01:15:30,074
I must know why
all this turned you into a stone.

658
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:36,996
I don't feel guilty towards you any more.

659
01:15:41,000 --> 01:15:42,797
Give my regards to Helena.

660
01:15:43,680 --> 01:15:46,717
Helena is dead. My son, too.

661
01:15:55,480 --> 01:15:56,469
I'm sorry.

662
01:16:29,160 --> 01:16:30,559
What will you have?

663
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:32,829
Tea, please.

664
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,713
My husband's been taken to Germany
for forced labour.

665
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:30,559
What time is your train?

666
01:17:31,360 --> 01:17:33,874
Early morning.

667
01:17:34,520 --> 01:17:36,909
There's a room here.
Won't you get some sleep?

668
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,437
I'm working till morning anyway.

669
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:08,157
Don't switch the light on.

670
01:18:10,280 --> 01:18:11,395
Thank you.

671
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,673
Good evening.

672
01:19:53,720 --> 01:19:55,312
I'm supposed to prepare here.

673
01:21:24,240 --> 01:21:25,309
Hi.

674
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,349
Hello.

675
01:21:32,280 --> 01:21:34,510
Blind, he has already come.

676
01:21:36,480 --> 01:21:39,950
We know everything now.
Poor boy, he wasn't involved at all.

677
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:43,037
When they bring him to the cell
after a beating he asks: "What for?"

678
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:46,231
He often says his wife's name, Marta.

679
01:21:47,240 --> 01:21:49,800
There's no man strong enough
to stand such a beating.

680
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,957
Yesterday he was taken to the hospital,

681
01:21:53,000 --> 01:21:55,230
ward number 14.

682
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:59,710
Perhaps the order I gave
and the conclusion I arrived at

683
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,830
couldn't be reasonably justified.

684
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:05,350
But I still think
I shouldn't lose sight of the paths

685
01:22:05,400 --> 01:22:12,590
that lead you and me and all those
who've trusted me out of the darkness.

686
01:22:13,040 --> 01:22:17,158
So, this innocent, unnecessary man,

687
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:20,988
who is so like any one of us,
only without a pistol,

688
01:22:21,040 --> 01:22:24,635
this... worm can be saved by us.

689
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,999
We've got a group to perform this task.

690
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:32,953
We'll get German uniforms,
weapons and a car.

691
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,434
As you're the only one
who has ever seen him,

692
01:22:35,480 --> 01:22:38,278
I want you to be here at six in the morning.

693
01:22:38,880 --> 01:22:40,552
How can I thank you?

694
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,753
You don't need to.

695
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:49,158
You see, it's not irrelevant
whether I'm court-martialled for it.

696
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,270
But I'm at a loss myself.

697
01:22:51,320 --> 01:22:52,719
I don't know, either.

698
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:54,751
It's very hard on me.

699
01:22:55,320 --> 01:23:00,440
I'd like to defend myself
against you and yours alike.

700
01:23:03,600 --> 01:23:04,271
Grizzly...

701
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,559
I envy you.

702
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:33,033
I've refurnished the room.

703
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:34,479
Do you like it?

704
01:23:35,360 --> 01:23:37,032
I've got some news for you.

705
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:39,194
Good?

706
01:23:39,240 --> 01:23:41,356
Yes. Your husband is in hospital.

707
01:23:41,400 --> 01:23:42,594
I know where.

708
01:23:42,640 --> 01:23:44,631
They'll probably let him out tomorrow.

709
01:23:49,160 --> 01:23:50,752
Let him out?

710
01:23:50,800 --> 01:23:51,789
Yes.

711
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:17,236
I've got some bandages ready.

712
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,679
I must dress your wound.

713
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:21,755
No, it's not necessary. I'm all right now.

714
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:12,598
I hear of such terrible things
and I can understand so little.

715
01:25:13,240 --> 01:25:16,630
I wouldn't like us to flounder in this dung.

716
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:38,476
Did you want to have a child with Jan?

717
01:25:38,520 --> 01:25:39,509
No.

718
01:25:41,120 --> 01:25:44,157
Yes. I can't deceive you. I wanted it.

719
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:47,795
Oh, I hate this flat.

720
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:50,070
We should be in a quite different place.

721
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:52,315
But I'm afraid I can't provide for you.

722
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:55,079
Look, it's so hard to live anyway.

723
01:25:55,120 --> 01:25:57,350
We won't survive
if we have nobody to live for.

724
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:02,349
One shouldn't have children
at a time like this.

725
01:26:02,400 --> 01:26:04,709
If love is of paramount importance

726
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:07,752
then a baby that is not yet born
becomes the most important thing.

727
01:27:32,840 --> 01:27:34,398
You mustn't come here.

728
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:37,196
I don't want you to see
how you're both alike.

729
01:27:40,440 --> 01:27:43,637
Everything happens in the same places
and with the same words.

730
01:27:43,680 --> 01:27:46,194
No, words are always new.

731
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:51,639
- I've been finding you again.
- Yes, in other people who aren't us.

732
01:28:01,960 --> 01:28:06,192
I, who am leaving you,
feel reconciled with you now.

733
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:50,229
Sister...

734
01:28:51,720 --> 01:28:53,278
Sister, you need not go there.

735
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,514
But I want to.

736
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:55,549
Why?

737
01:28:56,600 --> 01:28:59,160
Because in this way, brother,
I can ask a question

738
01:29:01,400 --> 01:29:03,630
and get an answer at the same time.

739
01:29:37,560 --> 01:29:38,959
They're gone.

740
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:45,797
How quiet it is now.

741
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:57,390
- I must be going.
- Where to?

742
01:29:57,440 --> 01:29:58,589
I must.

743
01:29:58,640 --> 01:30:00,517
It's still too early for feeding.

744
01:30:00,560 --> 01:30:02,949
- I'm going to my father because...
- You're lying.

745
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:06,310
- But I'll be back just before the feeding.
- I won't let you go, I won't!

746
01:30:06,360 --> 01:30:09,511
- I can't be late.
- You must stay here for five minutes.

747
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:11,710
- Why?
- I don't know. I just want it.

748
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:14,595
- Are you crazy?
- I'm crazy, I'm crazy.

749
01:31:03,800 --> 01:31:06,439
Don't go there.
Be careful, they've set a trap.

750
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:00,955
Father, where's the overcoat I left here?

751
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:06,231
As long as you live
you can come and leave everything here.

752
01:32:06,280 --> 01:32:08,714
Add yours to all these unnecessary things.

753
01:32:08,760 --> 01:32:11,069
They've been collected
by many generations,

754
01:32:11,120 --> 01:32:14,317
through fires, famines, invasions and wars.

755
01:32:14,960 --> 01:32:18,191
All these objects, books and paintings -

756
01:32:18,240 --> 01:32:19,912
they are you.

757
01:32:19,960 --> 01:32:23,873
Look, your left profile
comes from your mother

758
01:32:23,920 --> 01:32:25,751
and the right from your father's side.

759
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:30,191
As long as you live,
you can always come here.

760
01:32:31,960 --> 01:32:35,839
Father, I've put you in danger
by leaving this overcoat here. I'm sorry.

761
01:32:35,880 --> 01:32:39,156
We'll go on sinking deeper and deeper.

762
01:32:40,480 --> 01:32:44,439
Your grandfather spent half of his life
on his own land,

763
01:32:44,480 --> 01:32:47,950
listening to the strikings
of an imaginary clock that measured his time.

764
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,470
We were gentle in gentle times,
and now...

765
01:32:53,160 --> 01:32:54,752
Nothing's changed, Father.

766
01:32:57,080 --> 01:33:00,072
There's blood on your overcoat.

767
01:33:00,120 --> 01:33:04,796
I try to live at your side
and to understand what you do.

768
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:07,229
What I must do, I must do myself.

769
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:12,391
There's a gun in your overcoat.

770
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:20,598
I wish you knew what it's like
when your own child is bleeding.

771
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:23,154
I know it. I know it very well.

772
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:26,595
It's they who are unhappy, not us.

773
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,312
Let's play something together.

774
01:33:31,160 --> 01:33:32,149
I can't.

775
01:33:32,640 --> 01:33:39,478
I curse you and her and him.
All of you who are deserting me.

776
01:33:40,200 --> 01:33:42,111
They've taken your daughter away too.

777
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:49,399
Those lice, son,

778
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,396
you carry them everywhere.

779
01:39:12,880 --> 01:39:17,317
And the fifth angel sounded the trumpet,
and I saw a star fall from heaven upon the earth

780
01:39:17,360 --> 01:39:20,079
and there was given to him
the key of the bottomless pit.

781
01:39:20,120 --> 01:39:23,032
From the smoke of the pit
there came out locusts upon the earth

782
01:39:23,080 --> 01:39:26,390
and power was given to them,
as the scorpions of the earth have power.

783
01:39:26,440 --> 01:39:30,479
It was commanded them that they should not
hurt the grass of the earth, nor any green thing

784
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:34,638
but only the men who have not
the sign of God on their foreheads.

785
01:40:15,880 --> 01:40:19,634
And in those days shall men seek death,
and shall not find it;

786
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:23,036
and shall desire to die,
and death shall flee from them.

787
01:40:37,560 --> 01:40:40,120
And the four angels were loosed,

788
01:40:40,160 --> 01:40:43,835
which were prepared for an hour,
and a day, and a month, and a year,

789
01:40:43,880 --> 01:40:46,110
for to slay the third part of men.

790
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:15,153
...and others.
