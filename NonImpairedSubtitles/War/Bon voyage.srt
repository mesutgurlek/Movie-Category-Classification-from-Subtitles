1
00:02:08,019 --> 00:02:10,214
Forgive me.

2
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,253
I'm falling at your feet...

3
00:02:12,457 --> 00:02:14,084
...blinded by admiration!

4
00:02:14,292 --> 00:02:15,486
Mr. Minister....

5
00:02:15,694 --> 00:02:18,094
I mean it. I'm pleased to meet you.

6
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:20,821
I can't say I saw the film.

7
00:02:21,032 --> 00:02:21,760
Really?

8
00:02:21,967 --> 00:02:24,458
I only saw you. The film can wait.

9
00:02:24,669 --> 00:02:28,070
You light up troubled times.

10
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,240
Did it shock you?

11
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:31,466
Lord, no! It's what we need.

12
00:02:31,676 --> 00:02:33,439
A little escapism.

13
00:02:33,645 --> 00:02:36,978
And with you around,
all our worries fade.

14
00:02:41,653 --> 00:02:43,314
Will there be a war?

15
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:47,253
Please! People ask me that
1 00 times a day.

16
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,926
Not you....

17
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:50,924
Not tonight!

18
00:03:33,238 --> 00:03:34,796
See you Thursday!

19
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:52,114
Viviane!

20
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:56,523
-Go away!
-Listen!

21
00:03:56,728 --> 00:03:58,821
You can tell them what you like!

22
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:46,433
Mr. Auger! Phone!

23
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:02,088
It's you.

24
00:05:02,294 --> 00:05:04,319
How did you get my number?

25
00:05:04,529 --> 00:05:06,326
You called her in Dijon?

26
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:08,294
She must have wondered.

27
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,263
Can I what?

28
00:05:10,468 --> 00:05:12,527
Slow down, I don't understand.

29
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:17,968
It's late. Why not tomorrow morning?

30
00:05:19,144 --> 00:05:21,806
I am pleased. What's going on?

31
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:25,415
I'm pleased, I said. Just calm down.

32
00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:28,115
I don't have your address.

33
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:29,787
Just a second.

34
00:05:31,356 --> 00:05:32,914
Let me note it.

35
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,363
Where have you been?
I was worried. Come in.

36
00:06:20,372 --> 00:06:22,203
Are you cold? You're shivering.

37
00:06:22,407 --> 00:06:25,001
-It's emotion.
-At seeing me again?

38
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,440
It's been a long time.

39
00:06:27,646 --> 00:06:29,273
Nice place.

40
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:30,675
It's not finished.

41
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:32,713
I saw it in a magazine, but--

42
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:33,747
Keep it on.

43
00:06:33,952 --> 00:06:35,351
We're not staying in?

44
00:06:35,553 --> 00:06:36,577
What, then?

45
00:06:36,788 --> 00:06:37,982
Come on.

46
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,181
What's wrong, Viviane?
What's happened?

47
00:06:42,093 --> 00:06:43,287
That.

48
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:51,895
-Is he...?
-Yes, he fell.

49
00:06:52,103 --> 00:06:53,365
From up there?

50
00:06:53,571 --> 00:06:55,903
-You were down here?
-No, up there.

51
00:06:56,107 --> 00:06:56,903
Did you...?

52
00:06:57,108 --> 00:06:59,167
No, I didn't! He slipped.

53
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:00,435
He just fell?

54
00:07:00,645 --> 00:07:02,237
-I slapped him.
-Why?

55
00:07:02,447 --> 00:07:04,711
He was drunk. He pounced on me.

56
00:07:17,162 --> 00:07:18,424
What can we do?

57
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,598
What do you mean?

58
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:24,468
Stop!

59
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:27,394
Don't touch anything!

60
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,771
I'll call the police.

61
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:33,443
Not the police!

62
00:07:33,645 --> 00:07:35,169
Let me handle it.

63
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:37,575
-It's an accident!
-Who'd believe that?

64
00:07:37,782 --> 00:07:40,342
It was self-defense! He slipped.

65
00:07:40,552 --> 00:07:43,919
Honestly, Frédéric,
can't you imagine the scandal?

66
00:07:44,122 --> 00:07:46,750
The papers will only hound me with it.

67
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:48,956
Think of my new film!

68
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,788
-Try to calm down.
-Leave me.

69
00:07:51,996 --> 00:07:55,625
I was wrong. I thought you could--
I don't know--

70
00:07:56,534 --> 00:07:58,365
That you'd help me.

71
00:08:28,566 --> 00:08:30,056
-What did he do?
-Who?

72
00:08:30,268 --> 00:08:32,702
-Him!
-Business.

73
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:34,838
-What kind?
-All kinds.

74
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:37,507
He backed Midnight Ball.
You saw it?

75
00:08:37,709 --> 00:08:40,143
-Of course.
-Put him down!

76
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,175
-Did you like it?
-What?

77
00:08:44,382 --> 00:08:46,009
The film.

78
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:48,211
Sort of.

79
00:08:48,419 --> 00:08:50,819
-Did I sing well?
-Very well.

80
00:08:51,022 --> 00:08:55,220
I was dubbed.
I'm so pleased you couldn't tell.

81
00:08:55,426 --> 00:08:57,860
-What do you want?
-His car keys.

82
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,227
-He's bleeding.
-He fell.

83
00:09:01,432 --> 00:09:02,831
Come on.

84
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:14,345
-It's a river?
-No, a canal.

85
00:09:14,546 --> 00:09:16,377
-Is it deep?
-Don't worry.

86
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:19,516
-Want me to come?
-No, go back inside.

87
00:09:19,717 --> 00:09:21,548
Clean everything up!

88
00:09:21,753 --> 00:09:23,345
I'll call you tomorrow.

89
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:27,420
-I knew it.
-What?

90
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:28,592
That you'd help.

91
00:09:28,793 --> 00:09:30,420
You'd forgotten me.

92
00:09:30,628 --> 00:09:31,652
Forgotten?

93
00:09:31,863 --> 00:09:33,956
You never got in touch.

94
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,664
Your life was too crowded.

95
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,927
WAR OR PEACE?

96
00:10:54,145 --> 00:10:56,136
PEACE AT STAKE

97
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:04,318
THE MYSTERIOUS DEATH
OF ANDRÉ ARPEL

98
00:11:40,758 --> 00:11:42,783
Please don't get up.

99
00:11:44,595 --> 00:11:45,562
Forgive me.

100
00:11:45,763 --> 00:11:47,355
It's hard to reach you.

101
00:11:47,565 --> 00:11:49,430
Yes, these days....

102
00:11:50,201 --> 00:11:51,225
What is it?

103
00:11:51,436 --> 00:11:54,405
You seem tired.
Are events worrying you?

104
00:11:54,605 --> 00:11:56,197
No, it's not that.

105
00:11:57,108 --> 00:11:58,666
Can I confide in you?

106
00:11:58,876 --> 00:12:00,571
You said such kind things to me.

107
00:12:00,778 --> 00:12:01,745
Please do.

108
00:12:03,081 --> 00:12:05,845
Did you know André Arpel?
He's dead.

109
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:06,914
I know.

110
00:12:07,118 --> 00:12:10,053
I knew him long ago.
Perhaps you heard?

111
00:12:11,055 --> 00:12:12,647
I'd stopped seeing him.

112
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:17,157
Now the police want to see me
next week, but I won't go.

113
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:20,522
Are you listening?

114
00:12:20,732 --> 00:12:22,199
Why won't you go?

115
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,868
Can you imagine the papers?

116
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,738
They have bigger concerns.

117
00:12:27,939 --> 00:12:29,338
You don't know them.

118
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,905
I don't?

119
00:12:34,579 --> 00:12:35,910
Why are you here?

120
00:12:36,114 --> 00:12:38,139
I refuse to see the police.

121
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:40,746
I'm not the police chief.

122
00:12:40,952 --> 00:12:42,579
You could call him.

123
00:12:42,787 --> 00:12:45,085
Perhaps. I'll think about it.

124
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,152
Jeanne Lanvin.

125
00:12:47,825 --> 00:12:48,792
I'm sorry?

126
00:12:48,993 --> 00:12:50,893
Your perfume.

127
00:12:51,095 --> 00:12:52,528
Yes, Scandal.

128
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,857
I'm very fond of it.

129
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:57,293
You could call him now.

130
00:12:57,502 --> 00:12:59,094
-Who?
-The police chief.

131
00:12:59,303 --> 00:13:02,397
I can't just now,
but I will. I promise.

132
00:13:04,308 --> 00:13:08,608
I don't know why you're
so worried over nothing.

133
00:13:08,813 --> 00:13:10,940
Didn't they arrest his killer?

134
00:13:23,694 --> 00:13:27,653
Mr. Auger? I'm Vouriot,
your court-appointed lawyer.

135
00:13:27,865 --> 00:13:31,232
I can't take care of you now.
I've been called up.

136
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,927
-I leave tomorrow.
-But who--?

137
00:13:34,138 --> 00:13:35,662
I'll be back soon.

138
00:13:35,873 --> 00:13:38,137
It'll all be over in three weeks.

139
00:13:38,342 --> 00:13:40,936
Not even Hitler wants war.

140
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:43,136
He'll make peace, you'll see.

141
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:45,975
So behave. You're better off here.

142
00:13:46,851 --> 00:13:48,375
Seen the magistrate?

143
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:51,578
Of course.
Things are all over the place.

144
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,383
I've read your statement.

145
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,990
We'll see about that later.
So you stole the car?

146
00:14:00,031 --> 00:14:03,057
Not knowing the owner
was in the trunk?

147
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,104
Tell the police what you like...

148
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:11,332
...but be straight with me
or get another lawyer.

149
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:13,737
What did you do with the gun?

150
00:14:13,945 --> 00:14:15,037
What gun?

151
00:14:15,246 --> 00:14:18,238
That fellow, Arpel, had been shot.

152
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,845
You didn't know that?

153
00:14:27,058 --> 00:14:32,360
A few months later....

154
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,683
Everybody out.

155
00:15:01,893 --> 00:15:03,417
-What's up?
-We're leaving.

156
00:15:03,628 --> 00:15:05,721
-What's going on?
-The Germans are coming!

157
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,694
-Where are they?
-A day away. Want to wait?

158
00:15:51,309 --> 00:15:53,436
-Cut it out!
-Do you mind?

159
00:16:07,024 --> 00:16:09,254
Any idea where they're taking us?

160
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,257
Down South. Where else?

161
00:16:11,462 --> 00:16:14,260
We won't be alone on the roads.
This'll be fun.

162
00:16:21,339 --> 00:16:22,533
Come on.

163
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,298
What are you doing?

164
00:16:40,224 --> 00:16:41,452
Shut up!

165
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,606
Your turn.

166
00:17:05,516 --> 00:17:06,915
Don't stay here!

167
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,331
Bloody thing!

168
00:17:55,466 --> 00:17:58,924
June 1 4, 1 940

169
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:22,419
Who?

170
00:18:25,096 --> 00:18:27,564
Viviane Denvert?
No, she's not here.

171
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:30,929
There's no one left,
no films, nothing.

172
00:18:32,136 --> 00:18:33,160
What?

173
00:18:33,838 --> 00:18:36,500
I don't know, sir,
probably in Bordeaux.

174
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,536
They've all fled there,
all the upper crust.

175
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:44,208
I'm staying here.

176
00:18:45,182 --> 00:18:46,513
I'm learning German.

177
00:19:57,855 --> 00:19:59,413
Your papers!

178
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,650
Are you crazy?

179
00:20:04,862 --> 00:20:07,422
Just a bit of fun.
How come you're here?

180
00:20:07,631 --> 00:20:09,155
I got the last train too.

181
00:20:09,366 --> 00:20:11,231
-Going to Bordeaux?
-You too?

182
00:20:11,435 --> 00:20:14,029
You bet.
That's where it's all happening.

183
00:20:14,238 --> 00:20:15,830
How did you get away?

184
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:18,600
I'll tell you later. Come on.

185
00:20:32,723 --> 00:20:35,248
Here. I couldn't find a glass.

186
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:37,120
That's all right.

187
00:20:44,435 --> 00:20:46,494
Blimey! You needed that.

188
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:49,239
This is a friend, Mr....

189
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,407
Auger.

190
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:51,836
Mr. Auger.

191
00:20:52,877 --> 00:20:54,606
She's at the Collège de France.

192
00:20:54,812 --> 00:20:57,110
-Don't say that!
-It's not true?

193
00:20:57,314 --> 00:20:59,214
Look, no one cares.

194
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,153
What did I say?

195
00:21:05,256 --> 00:21:07,690
She gets off in Angoulême.
Too bad.

196
00:21:11,595 --> 00:21:13,688
You'll catch your death here.

197
00:21:13,898 --> 00:21:15,024
I'm all right.

198
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:18,895
The nuns can give you a seat.
I'll say you're ill.

199
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:20,502
I'm not ill.

200
00:21:20,704 --> 00:21:22,365
-It's absurd.
-I'll be back.

201
00:21:27,444 --> 00:21:29,742
Is your friend always like that?

202
00:21:30,748 --> 00:21:32,079
You know him well?

203
00:21:32,283 --> 00:21:34,513
Not very well. He did me a favor.

204
00:21:35,286 --> 00:21:36,446
Must be a habit.

205
00:21:36,654 --> 00:21:38,588
He just can't help himself.

206
00:21:42,793 --> 00:21:44,385
Do you want to sit down?

207
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,494
You're at the Collège de France?

208
00:21:51,702 --> 00:21:53,693
I'm just an assistant.

209
00:21:54,505 --> 00:21:55,972
In a physics lab.

210
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,301
What do you do?

211
00:22:00,044 --> 00:22:01,511
I've done a lot of things.

212
00:22:01,712 --> 00:22:03,009
Like what?

213
00:22:03,213 --> 00:22:05,340
I started out as a--

214
00:22:05,549 --> 00:22:07,107
Well, I was in a--

215
00:22:07,885 --> 00:22:10,353
But that didn't last long. Then l--

216
00:22:10,554 --> 00:22:12,112
You weren't called up?

217
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:15,292
No, I was....
I was away, that's why.

218
00:22:15,993 --> 00:22:17,551
Where were you?

219
00:22:18,062 --> 00:22:20,155
-Abroad?
-Abroad, yes.

220
00:22:20,898 --> 00:22:23,264
It took a while to get back.

221
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,324
I had to find a boat.

222
00:22:48,592 --> 00:22:50,685
Professor!

223
00:22:53,364 --> 00:22:54,456
Wait!

224
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,791
You'll hurt yourself.

225
00:22:58,068 --> 00:23:01,834
Camille! We thought
you'd never get here.

226
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:04,667
It kept stopping.
I almost went mad.

227
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:07,469
-How are you, Mr. Girard?
-I'm all right.

228
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:11,047
We'll meet again?

229
00:23:12,082 --> 00:23:13,549
Where's the Collège de France?

230
00:23:14,585 --> 00:23:16,314
You have all the papers?

231
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,284
I took everything I found in the lab.

232
00:23:20,591 --> 00:23:23,856
Your attention, please.
Following an air raid...

233
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:27,497
...traffic is suspended
until further notice.

234
00:23:28,599 --> 00:23:31,625
Would all passengers
please leave the train.

235
00:23:35,572 --> 00:23:37,904
My case! Get my case!

236
00:23:41,078 --> 00:23:43,638
-How will you manage in England?
-I'll see.

237
00:23:43,847 --> 00:23:45,109
No one's expecting you.

238
00:23:45,315 --> 00:23:47,112
I have friends there.

239
00:23:47,317 --> 00:23:49,751
I must leave France, Camille, my dear.

240
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:53,483
The Germans will be here
in a week or even sooner.

241
00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:00,025
What?

242
00:24:00,597 --> 00:24:01,791
You took them?

243
00:24:01,999 --> 00:24:03,967
Yes, it was safer that way.

244
00:24:04,501 --> 00:24:05,934
But the trucks....

245
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:08,263
I didn't quite trust them.

246
00:24:17,347 --> 00:24:19,577
-When does the boat leave?
-Tomorrow.

247
00:24:20,317 --> 00:24:21,807
Are you going too?

248
00:24:22,019 --> 00:24:24,419
No, I can't. Because of Mother.

249
00:24:24,621 --> 00:24:27,055
Broken hips are tricky.

250
00:24:28,325 --> 00:24:29,917
I haven't heard from her.

251
00:24:30,994 --> 00:24:33,292
Going to Bordeaux, by any chance?

252
00:24:59,523 --> 00:25:02,720
Don't worry.
They've been so helpful.

253
00:25:03,494 --> 00:25:06,088
Where are they from? Paris?

254
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:07,929
I think so.

255
00:25:18,041 --> 00:25:19,565
Don't touch, gentlemen!

256
00:26:25,742 --> 00:26:26,868
She's asleep, sir.

257
00:26:31,048 --> 00:26:33,573
Oh, no! For pity's sake!

258
00:26:34,418 --> 00:26:36,318
It's late. You have to get up.

259
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:39,751
I didn't sleep a wink.
This place is so noisy.

260
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:42,221
I know. No one slept a wink.

261
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:45,785
The president and the government
have arrived.

262
00:26:45,996 --> 00:26:47,861
I had to work all night.

263
00:26:48,065 --> 00:26:49,726
Poor Jean-Etienne.

264
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,067
I have to go.

265
00:26:51,268 --> 00:26:53,600
Go later. Get some sleep now.

266
00:26:55,138 --> 00:26:56,469
The cabinet's convening.

267
00:26:56,673 --> 00:26:59,335
Think of an excuse. Send a note.

268
00:27:04,147 --> 00:27:05,239
You can barely stand.

269
00:27:07,017 --> 00:27:09,247
-I saw the de Lusses.
-They're here?

270
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:11,444
They had to sleep in their car.

271
00:27:11,655 --> 00:27:12,679
You're joking!

272
00:27:12,890 --> 00:27:15,290
Go and see.
They're parked outside.

273
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,518
1 27, please.

274
00:27:18,795 --> 00:27:19,887
Beaufort here.

275
00:27:22,032 --> 00:27:24,933
Did you reach the command? Who?

276
00:27:25,702 --> 00:27:26,896
And?

277
00:27:31,008 --> 00:27:35,104
Jacqueline, sleeping in the street!
I must tell everybody.

278
00:27:42,052 --> 00:27:43,280
I'm on my way.

279
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:46,612
What's wrong?

280
00:27:47,024 --> 00:27:48,582
They've reached Orléans.

281
00:27:49,359 --> 00:27:50,724
Already?

282
00:28:22,025 --> 00:28:23,253
Darling!

283
00:28:23,727 --> 00:28:24,989
I'm half-dead!

284
00:28:25,195 --> 00:28:28,858
You've no idea what Albert and I
have been through.

285
00:28:30,367 --> 00:28:33,234
Not just the exhaustion,
but the humiliation.

286
00:28:33,904 --> 00:28:35,337
They're monsters here.

287
00:28:35,539 --> 00:28:36,904
Know where I slept?

288
00:28:37,107 --> 00:28:38,131
Not in the car?

289
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:43,211
Still, it's good to know
you have a room.

290
00:28:44,281 --> 00:28:46,374
-Want to take a bath?
-Later.

291
00:28:46,783 --> 00:28:50,116
I have to eat something,
or I'm going to faint.

292
00:28:50,721 --> 00:28:52,382
Shall I come with you?

293
00:28:52,589 --> 00:28:53,920
Twin beds, remember.

294
00:28:54,124 --> 00:28:56,183
Look, it's not a travel agency.

295
00:28:56,393 --> 00:29:01,126
Albert claims I'm restless,
but no man ever complained before.

296
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:03,333
What is it?

297
00:29:13,143 --> 00:29:14,041
Alex!

298
00:29:15,312 --> 00:29:16,643
Viviane.

299
00:29:16,847 --> 00:29:19,281
Did they give you my note last night?

300
00:29:19,483 --> 00:29:20,814
Yes, but I can't.

301
00:29:21,018 --> 00:29:22,713
-You're not free?
-Not for dinner.

302
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:24,250
Lunch, then?

303
00:29:24,454 --> 00:29:25,580
It's not easy.

304
00:29:25,789 --> 00:29:27,552
Surely we can have a drink?

305
00:29:27,758 --> 00:29:30,056
Maybe. I'll let you know.

306
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:33,491
I hoped it would be easier
to see you down here.

307
00:29:34,765 --> 00:29:36,130
I'm not a minister.

308
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:39,097
But that could be a blessing right now.

309
00:29:40,637 --> 00:29:43,265
-Still following you.
-His paper sent him.

310
00:29:43,473 --> 00:29:45,805
-He's mad about you.
-Honestly!

311
00:29:46,009 --> 00:29:48,443
He even said so at the Gramonts'.

312
00:29:48,645 --> 00:29:52,706
That you embodied French grace.
His meaning was clear.

313
00:30:02,993 --> 00:30:04,585
We have to leave.

314
00:30:04,795 --> 00:30:05,989
For the colonies?

315
00:30:06,196 --> 00:30:08,460
Why not? We're trapped here.

316
00:30:09,032 --> 00:30:11,227
Move the government to Senegal?

317
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:14,028
Be reasonable, Brémond.

318
00:30:15,138 --> 00:30:17,299
-The war is lost.
-Not yet.

319
00:30:17,507 --> 00:30:19,304
I'm afraid it is.

320
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:22,034
All we can do is ask for an armistice.

321
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:23,337
Reynaud won't.

322
00:30:23,547 --> 00:30:25,981
Let him resign. The marshal's ready.

323
00:30:26,183 --> 00:30:28,481
-It will take a vote.
-Who'd oppose it?

324
00:30:28,685 --> 00:30:30,175
Two men will.

325
00:30:30,387 --> 00:30:31,411
Who?

326
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,555
-Oh, yes, of course.
-Who?

327
00:30:33,757 --> 00:30:35,554
Mandel and that de Gaulle.

328
00:30:36,827 --> 00:30:37,794
Turn left!

329
00:30:37,994 --> 00:30:39,586
We're already late!

330
00:30:45,202 --> 00:30:46,169
Watch it!

331
00:30:50,507 --> 00:30:52,270
Did you see that?

332
00:30:54,177 --> 00:30:56,509
There's nothing on Monnet.

333
00:30:58,148 --> 00:31:00,810
Where are you going?
It's not the way!

334
00:31:01,551 --> 00:31:04,679
Weygand should change
points six and nine.

335
00:31:04,888 --> 00:31:05,855
Let me out!

336
00:31:06,056 --> 00:31:07,023
What's wrong?

337
00:31:07,224 --> 00:31:09,158
-I have to buy something.
-Not now!

338
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,690
I won't be long.

339
00:31:19,035 --> 00:31:20,297
Can I help you?

340
00:31:22,272 --> 00:31:25,207
Do you have any...?
I'd like some gloves.

341
00:31:25,408 --> 00:31:26,966
Leather or wool?

342
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:29,475
I don't know. Leather.

343
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,044
What size?

344
00:31:31,715 --> 00:31:33,273
Could I see your hand?

345
00:31:33,483 --> 00:31:36,680
That looks like a seven.
What color?

346
00:31:37,053 --> 00:31:37,781
The same.

347
00:31:37,988 --> 00:31:39,615
-White?
-That's right.

348
00:31:40,590 --> 00:31:42,421
-They freed you?
-I escaped.

349
00:31:42,626 --> 00:31:44,389
They emptied all the prisons.

350
00:31:44,594 --> 00:31:45,891
You have to hide.

351
00:31:46,096 --> 00:31:47,996
Why? No one cares now.

352
00:31:48,198 --> 00:31:50,223
-I have these.
-I'll take them.

353
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:52,060
Which ones?

354
00:31:56,273 --> 00:31:57,706
You shot him!

355
00:31:57,908 --> 00:32:00,103
-Arpel. You shot him.
-Stop it!

356
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,369
What did you lie to me for?

357
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:04,103
Shut up! I'll explain.

358
00:32:04,314 --> 00:32:05,713
Don't move!

359
00:32:11,588 --> 00:32:13,579
Viviane, what are you doing?

360
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:15,314
It's not bad, is it?

361
00:32:15,525 --> 00:32:18,551
Not bad. Let's go!
How much do I owe you?

362
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:20,662
With the hat as well?

363
00:32:24,301 --> 00:32:26,701
Sometimes I wonder if you realize....

364
00:32:29,139 --> 00:32:31,699
Isn't that...?
What's her name again?

365
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,034
Viviane Denvert.

366
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:34,904
That's it, Viviane Denvert.

367
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:42,407
You know her?

368
00:32:44,621 --> 00:32:47,920
You know her so-so,
or you know her?

369
00:32:48,124 --> 00:32:50,092
I know her, okay.

370
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:52,591
You devil! I get it now.

371
00:32:52,796 --> 00:32:54,559
Why you came all this way.

372
00:32:54,764 --> 00:32:55,822
So who's he?

373
00:32:56,032 --> 00:32:59,297
Don't you recognize him?
Mr. Beaufort, the minister.

374
00:32:59,836 --> 00:33:02,964
They make a lovely couple,
don't they?

375
00:33:13,617 --> 00:33:16,381
Calm down, children!
Not in the house!

376
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:19,820
The town hall's sending
more mattresses.

377
00:33:24,361 --> 00:33:27,125
We're used to refugees in Bordeaux.

378
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:28,592
First in 1 870...

379
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,793
...then in 1 91 4.

380
00:33:31,635 --> 00:33:34,263
I only have my son's room left.

381
00:33:34,471 --> 00:33:36,632
He's on the road somewhere.

382
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,268
-My bedspread!
-Sorry!

383
00:33:40,477 --> 00:33:42,342
-Can I make a call?
-Locally?

384
00:33:42,545 --> 00:33:44,206
Yes, I'll pay. Don't worry.

385
00:33:44,414 --> 00:33:46,177
The phone's in my room.

386
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:57,149
Maurice, it's me.

387
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:59,294
Yes, pal, I'm here.

388
00:33:59,763 --> 00:34:01,788
I'll tell you all about it.

389
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,091
Who?

390
00:34:04,567 --> 00:34:07,229
Really? When did they get here?

391
00:34:07,437 --> 00:34:08,529
Auger!

392
00:34:08,905 --> 00:34:10,270
Hold on, Maurice.

393
00:34:11,374 --> 00:34:13,433
Wait! What's the big rush?

394
00:34:14,444 --> 00:34:16,503
You don't know where she is!

395
00:34:16,713 --> 00:34:18,271
I'll find the place.

396
00:34:18,948 --> 00:34:20,540
What are you after?

397
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,116
The government!

398
00:34:57,654 --> 00:35:01,886
We're jam-packed!
That's all there is to it!

399
00:35:02,092 --> 00:35:03,616
I wired you two days ago!

400
00:35:03,827 --> 00:35:05,226
Me too, three days ago!

401
00:35:05,428 --> 00:35:07,293
I'm the Countess Roberti.

402
00:35:07,497 --> 00:35:08,464
I'm sorry.

403
00:35:08,665 --> 00:35:10,724
-Get me the manager.
-He's ill.

404
00:35:10,934 --> 00:35:12,731
You have fifth-floor rooms.

405
00:35:12,936 --> 00:35:15,461
-They're staff rooms.
-They'll do!

406
00:35:15,672 --> 00:35:17,697
They're for the senators.

407
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:22,300
-Miss Denvert.
-She's out.

408
00:35:22,512 --> 00:35:24,377
-Will she...?
-I can't say, sir.

409
00:35:27,283 --> 00:35:29,649
It's all the leftists' fault.

410
00:35:29,853 --> 00:35:33,289
I knew the whole thing
would end in disaster.

411
00:35:35,658 --> 00:35:39,287
Russians in the German army
raped women in Belgium.

412
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:02,841
Why are you here?

413
00:36:03,052 --> 00:36:04,076
For the professor.

414
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,515
He hasn't left?

415
00:36:05,722 --> 00:36:06,780
But the boat--

416
00:36:06,990 --> 00:36:09,515
He needs official papers
to get onboard.

417
00:36:09,726 --> 00:36:11,284
-Where is he?
-Upstairs.

418
00:36:11,494 --> 00:36:13,928
Caught up in all their red tape.

419
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:16,428
A genius like him! It's maddening!

420
00:36:20,703 --> 00:36:22,000
Are you staying here?

421
00:36:23,306 --> 00:36:24,364
Good.

422
00:36:24,574 --> 00:36:27,372
After an hour here, I'm ashamed.

423
00:36:27,577 --> 00:36:29,772
Have you heard these people?

424
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:33,346
The Germans are in Paris,
and it hardly bothers them.

425
00:36:35,185 --> 00:36:36,846
-Don't you care?
-I do--

426
00:36:37,053 --> 00:36:38,543
No, you don't.

427
00:36:38,755 --> 00:36:41,451
I have other worries. I'm sorry.

428
00:36:41,658 --> 00:36:43,387
At a time like this?

429
00:36:43,593 --> 00:36:46,153
You have yours.
The professor, heavy water....

430
00:36:48,198 --> 00:36:49,256
You know?

431
00:36:49,766 --> 00:36:50,664
You told me.

432
00:36:50,867 --> 00:36:51,765
I did?

433
00:36:51,968 --> 00:36:54,198
You talked about it in the car.

434
00:36:54,404 --> 00:36:56,497
-Weren't you asleep?
-Not all the time.

435
00:36:56,706 --> 00:36:59,266
Is it a secret? What is it exactly?

436
00:37:01,211 --> 00:37:04,669
A special chemical compound.
That's all I can say.

437
00:37:05,381 --> 00:37:06,609
All right.

438
00:37:13,857 --> 00:37:17,793
It's the world's only heavy water.
It must reach England.

439
00:37:17,994 --> 00:37:21,486
If the Germans get it,
it'll be a disaster.

440
00:37:21,698 --> 00:37:23,063
Really? Why?

441
00:37:37,780 --> 00:37:40,578
-Am I boring you?
-Excuse me.

442
00:37:41,818 --> 00:37:43,911
What's happening?

443
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:45,212
I can't say.

444
00:37:45,421 --> 00:37:46,888
-We can't go on.
-I know.

445
00:37:47,090 --> 00:37:49,923
-Is the war still on?
-We're deliberating.

446
00:37:50,126 --> 00:37:52,094
It must end. Sue for peace!

447
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,156
You have a room.

448
00:37:56,766 --> 00:37:58,734
Wonderful. In which hotel?

449
00:37:58,935 --> 00:38:00,903
A girls' high school, actually.

450
00:38:01,104 --> 00:38:02,071
Seriously?

451
00:38:02,272 --> 00:38:04,137
I hear it's very comfortable.

452
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,307
That's it!

453
00:38:05,508 --> 00:38:08,739
Albert, if I don't like it,
I'm off to Nice.

454
00:38:08,945 --> 00:38:10,537
Thank you anyway.

455
00:38:12,682 --> 00:38:14,946
May I have a word? Do you mind?

456
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:20,783
You're crazy!
Someone might recognize you!

457
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:23,049
-Can't we talk?
-Not now!

458
00:38:38,708 --> 00:38:41,336
Jean-Etienne, meet Frédéric.

459
00:38:41,544 --> 00:38:43,808
He knew my brothers in Dijon.

460
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:45,975
He lived next door.

461
00:38:46,182 --> 00:38:48,013
Our little neighbor.

462
00:38:48,217 --> 00:38:50,208
How long has it been now?

463
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:53,654
You haven't changed.
How do you do it?

464
00:38:54,324 --> 00:38:56,087
Viviane, let's have lunch.

465
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:58,556
I'll be down in five minutes.

466
00:39:13,142 --> 00:39:15,042
The military situation looks bad.

467
00:39:15,244 --> 00:39:16,802
We need to talk.

468
00:39:24,654 --> 00:39:25,621
Camille!

469
00:39:28,157 --> 00:39:29,715
Do you have the papers?

470
00:39:29,926 --> 00:39:30,893
What?

471
00:39:31,094 --> 00:39:35,997
They don't seem to understand.
They're too wary to sign anything.

472
00:39:36,199 --> 00:39:37,860
They'll be the death of me.

473
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,495
The death of me.

474
00:39:54,751 --> 00:39:57,686
I know, I told you a pack of lies.

475
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,412
Let me speak.

476
00:39:59,622 --> 00:40:01,954
He'd been harassing me.

477
00:40:02,158 --> 00:40:02,920
Arpel?

478
00:40:03,126 --> 00:40:06,061
He'd threatened to write
to the press about me.

479
00:40:06,262 --> 00:40:07,229
What for?

480
00:40:07,430 --> 00:40:11,560
Some business
about jewels I borrowed once.

481
00:40:11,768 --> 00:40:13,360
-Who from?
-People.

482
00:40:13,569 --> 00:40:15,730
-You gave them back?
-Most of them.

483
00:40:15,938 --> 00:40:17,872
Really, it was so long ago!

484
00:40:18,074 --> 00:40:19,041
So you shot him?

485
00:40:19,242 --> 00:40:22,177
He scared me.
The gun went off in my hand.

486
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:23,572
-Whose was it?
-Mine.

487
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,747
And then?

488
00:40:24,947 --> 00:40:26,642
I put it away.

489
00:40:29,786 --> 00:40:33,916
When I saw your photo in the paper,
I almost fainted.

490
00:40:34,624 --> 00:40:38,492
I couldn't even write to you.
They open prisoners' mail.

491
00:40:39,896 --> 00:40:41,090
I cried and cried.

492
00:40:43,166 --> 00:40:44,565
You don't believe me?

493
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:47,827
I can see you don't.

494
00:40:50,073 --> 00:40:52,166
What will become of us?

495
00:40:56,012 --> 00:40:57,411
Don't be afraid.

496
00:41:05,988 --> 00:41:08,218
Tell them to start without me.

497
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,686
I have to go.

498
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,088
Shall I wait?

499
00:41:15,298 --> 00:41:17,425
No, go! All of Paris is here!

500
00:41:17,633 --> 00:41:19,123
You have a room in town?

501
00:41:19,335 --> 00:41:22,634
Stay in. I'll come over.
Give me the address.

502
00:41:25,308 --> 00:41:27,970
-When?
-When I can. I'm not totally free.

503
00:41:28,177 --> 00:41:30,168
-I noticed. Is that new?
-What?

504
00:41:30,379 --> 00:41:32,813
Beaufort. Your role
supporting the republic.

505
00:41:33,015 --> 00:41:36,416
Please. It's not easy.
Without Jean-Etienne....

506
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:50,227
Wait! Don't get angry. I'm sorry.

507
00:41:50,433 --> 00:41:52,799
-I'll come to see you.
-At Christmas?

508
00:41:53,002 --> 00:41:55,493
-Why are you like this?
-I was in jail!

509
00:41:55,705 --> 00:41:57,832
And for whom? I never shot anyone!

510
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,405
Shut up!

511
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:19,191
Mr. Beaufort would like a word.

512
00:42:21,864 --> 00:42:24,799
You left in such a rush.
Join us for lunch.

513
00:42:25,535 --> 00:42:27,867
Come along.
Viviane will be delighted.

514
00:42:28,070 --> 00:42:30,766
She hasn't seen you in so long.

515
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:43,711
I had a few questions for you.

516
00:42:44,587 --> 00:42:48,546
Viviane can be so nebulous.
It's hard to know anything.

517
00:42:49,425 --> 00:42:51,188
Was she married in Dijon?

518
00:42:51,394 --> 00:42:52,418
Married? No.

519
00:42:52,628 --> 00:42:53,856
She drove boys wild?

520
00:42:54,063 --> 00:42:55,030
I imagine so.

521
00:42:55,231 --> 00:42:57,995
What do you mean?
You lived next door.

522
00:42:59,402 --> 00:43:00,801
Sit down.

523
00:43:01,370 --> 00:43:02,962
Put yourself here.

524
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:07,437
We have quail today--

525
00:43:07,643 --> 00:43:10,373
No, grilled fish.
I don't have much time.

526
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,774
-Turbot?
-Perfect.

527
00:43:11,981 --> 00:43:13,539
-And for you, sir?
-The same.

528
00:43:13,749 --> 00:43:16,718
You don't mind turbot?
Turbot all around.

529
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,927
I invited him.

530
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:34,729
You lived it up in the provinces!

531
00:43:36,005 --> 00:43:37,267
What did you tell him?

532
00:43:37,473 --> 00:43:38,565
Don't worry!

533
00:43:38,774 --> 00:43:40,969
He's almost as discreet as you.

534
00:43:41,177 --> 00:43:42,439
For you, miss?

535
00:43:42,645 --> 00:43:44,738
You knew her father, the hero?

536
00:43:44,947 --> 00:43:47,609
She talks about him. Don't you?

537
00:43:48,784 --> 00:43:49,978
Your father.

538
00:43:50,186 --> 00:43:54,088
Enlisted in 1 91 4, wounded twice,
escaped three times.

539
00:43:54,290 --> 00:43:56,588
He'd be surprised to see her here.

540
00:43:56,792 --> 00:43:59,283
-Why?
-The atmosphere.

541
00:44:01,297 --> 00:44:02,730
What does that mean?

542
00:44:07,870 --> 00:44:09,861
Excuse me, I think someone....

543
00:44:11,974 --> 00:44:13,407
She's looking for me.

544
00:44:17,880 --> 00:44:19,245
What's the matter?

545
00:44:19,715 --> 00:44:23,742
The professor needs to speak
to your friend, the minister.

546
00:44:23,953 --> 00:44:25,784
-He's not my friend.
-Oh, come on!

547
00:44:25,988 --> 00:44:28,422
You even know the government.

548
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:29,591
No, I don't.

549
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,317
You have to help us. No one else can.

550
00:44:43,172 --> 00:44:44,332
Sorry.

551
00:45:21,043 --> 00:45:22,806
My secretary.

552
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,411
-Sit down.
-I'm all right.

553
00:45:24,613 --> 00:45:27,081
Take my place, I'm leaving.

554
00:45:27,283 --> 00:45:28,682
-You are?
-Good luck.

555
00:45:34,090 --> 00:45:35,284
Are you friends?

556
00:45:35,491 --> 00:45:36,822
No, not at all.

557
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:38,493
Your turbot, miss.

558
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:45,858
Mr. Auger?

559
00:45:46,602 --> 00:45:49,867
You are Frédéric Auger?
I'm André Arpel's nephew.

560
00:45:50,072 --> 00:45:51,937
Does André Arpel ring a bell?

561
00:45:52,141 --> 00:45:54,701
You were found with his body...

562
00:45:54,910 --> 00:45:57,538
...in the trunk of his car.
Aren't you in jail?

563
00:45:57,747 --> 00:45:58,907
Get off my back!

564
00:46:00,783 --> 00:46:02,375
Help! He's a criminal!

565
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,495
He killed my uncle!

566
00:46:33,849 --> 00:46:35,282
Murderer!

567
00:46:59,642 --> 00:47:01,269
I'm all right!

568
00:47:12,988 --> 00:47:14,012
Viviane, wait!

569
00:47:14,223 --> 00:47:16,453
Professor, give me a few hours.

570
00:47:16,659 --> 00:47:18,456
-It sails tonight.
-We have time.

571
00:47:18,661 --> 00:47:21,687
I need to speak to my colleagues.
Don't worry.

572
00:47:21,897 --> 00:47:24,559
Brémond, my secretary,
will stay with you.

573
00:47:54,029 --> 00:47:55,621
Marseilles called--

574
00:47:55,831 --> 00:47:57,025
Please!

575
00:47:59,268 --> 00:48:01,202
Your little neighbor!

576
00:48:01,403 --> 00:48:03,803
Bravo! A killer!

577
00:48:04,573 --> 00:48:06,200
And I eat with him!

578
00:48:06,408 --> 00:48:08,638
With France's future at stake!

579
00:48:10,279 --> 00:48:11,906
It's outrageous!

580
00:48:12,114 --> 00:48:13,081
I didn't know.

581
00:48:13,282 --> 00:48:15,807
-That he killed Arpel?
-That he was here.

582
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,885
-You didn't know about Arpel?
-No, I thought--

583
00:48:19,088 --> 00:48:22,216
You knew, and you hid it from me!

584
00:48:22,424 --> 00:48:24,688
Cut the lies, Viviane!

585
00:48:27,263 --> 00:48:28,195
What?

586
00:48:28,931 --> 00:48:30,057
The car's downstairs.

587
00:48:30,266 --> 00:48:31,665
Send it up!

588
00:48:32,067 --> 00:48:35,230
No, tell the driver
to come up for the files.

589
00:48:43,212 --> 00:48:45,510
How can I possibly trust you?

590
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:48,478
If only you'd tell me the truth.

591
00:48:48,684 --> 00:48:50,049
Just once.

592
00:48:50,252 --> 00:48:53,187
I'm sure he did it for me,
to protect me.

593
00:48:54,089 --> 00:48:58,185
He probably went to see Arpel,
and they must have fought.

594
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:00,919
He won't let anyone hurt me.

595
00:49:02,798 --> 00:49:04,925
Has he killed other men?

596
00:49:07,803 --> 00:49:11,068
He used to box critics
who gave me bad reviews.

597
00:49:12,908 --> 00:49:15,308
He got beaten up once too.

598
00:49:15,511 --> 00:49:18,674
Very touching,
but this is no time for tears.

599
00:49:21,016 --> 00:49:22,415
Where is he staying?

600
00:49:22,618 --> 00:49:23,778
I have no idea.

601
00:49:23,986 --> 00:49:26,386
I'll get the police to find him.

602
00:49:36,365 --> 00:49:38,299
-Did you find her?
-Who?

603
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:39,228
Her!

604
00:49:39,935 --> 00:49:43,029
Maurice, let me introduce you.
This is Auger.

605
00:49:46,175 --> 00:49:48,109
-You didn't find her?
-I did.

606
00:49:48,310 --> 00:49:50,972
Can you get her autograph next time?

607
00:49:51,981 --> 00:49:55,439
Not for me, for Maurice.
He's wild about actresses.

608
00:49:55,651 --> 00:49:58,882
-What have you told him?
-You can trust him.

609
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,585
Was her minister there?

610
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,763
Is he going to give her back?

611
00:50:10,065 --> 00:50:13,501
No? I admire you!
I'd have settled it by now.

612
00:50:13,702 --> 00:50:16,967
-You know, stars are special--
-Shut your mouth.

613
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,400
Don't give up! You've got the looks!

614
00:50:52,074 --> 00:50:54,508
Is the whole stock here?

615
00:50:55,444 --> 00:50:56,411
Is it safe?

616
00:50:56,612 --> 00:50:58,102
How do you mean?

617
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,504
It won't explode?

618
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:05,075
It's no use at all in this state.
You need uranium.

619
00:51:05,287 --> 00:51:08,984
And you can't get anywhere
without heavy water.

620
00:51:11,026 --> 00:51:14,757
It slows the neutrons
and creates the chain reaction.

621
00:51:14,963 --> 00:51:16,430
A chain reaction?

622
00:51:16,632 --> 00:51:17,462
Mr. Girard.

623
00:51:18,100 --> 00:51:19,067
Sorry.

624
00:51:22,471 --> 00:51:25,406
Be there at 5.
The place is a school.

625
00:51:25,874 --> 00:51:28,672
Find a garage.
You can't leave the car here.

626
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,845
Mr. Girard's guarding it.

627
00:51:31,046 --> 00:51:34,504
The city's teeming with spies.
I'll send you someone.

628
00:51:34,717 --> 00:51:37,686
Make yourself useful
and speed things up!

629
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,377
It can't take long to draft an order.

630
00:51:40,589 --> 00:51:42,147
Shall I do a rough copy?

631
00:51:52,501 --> 00:51:54,526
"Issued in Paris...."

632
00:51:55,104 --> 00:51:56,298
Excuse me, but....

633
00:51:56,505 --> 00:51:58,405
Do you need it back?

634
00:51:58,607 --> 00:52:01,770
We're sorry.
It's for our visas for Portugal.

635
00:52:01,977 --> 00:52:03,569
My pages.

636
00:52:03,979 --> 00:52:05,276
They're just here.

637
00:52:05,681 --> 00:52:07,444
I put them here.

638
00:52:08,784 --> 00:52:09,876
Father!

639
00:52:11,754 --> 00:52:13,153
No! It's interesting!

640
00:52:13,355 --> 00:52:15,380
It belongs to this gentleman!

641
00:52:15,591 --> 00:52:19,083
Sorry! You're the--
Forgive me, I took the liberty.

642
00:52:19,294 --> 00:52:20,556
A novel, isn't it?

643
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:23,755
-I hope so.
-It needs work, but it's all there.

644
00:52:23,966 --> 00:52:25,399
May I make some remarks?

645
00:52:25,601 --> 00:52:27,569
They could help this young man!

646
00:52:27,770 --> 00:52:29,260
You use vague words.

647
00:52:29,471 --> 00:52:32,668
For instance,
"One could hear the audience."

648
00:52:32,875 --> 00:52:35,571
Who is "one"? You?
Someone passing by?

649
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:37,040
I'll bear it in mind.

650
00:52:37,246 --> 00:52:39,237
"One" isn't anybody, you see?

651
00:53:13,182 --> 00:53:14,513
Going somewhere?

652
00:53:14,716 --> 00:53:15,683
Shopping.

653
00:53:15,884 --> 00:53:18,819
-You left the hotel alone.
-And you followed me?

654
00:53:19,822 --> 00:53:21,790
Really! Am I like that?

655
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:24,356
Can I drop you off somewhere?

656
00:53:24,560 --> 00:53:25,993
I have my car here.

657
00:53:26,195 --> 00:53:28,425
-There's no need.
-Be reasonable.

658
00:53:28,630 --> 00:53:31,531
All these refugees.
It's not safe for you.

659
00:53:31,733 --> 00:53:33,701
-I'll get the car.
-Don't!

660
00:53:33,902 --> 00:53:36,462
Why not? Are you scared of me?

661
00:53:37,439 --> 00:53:38,531
You avoid me.

662
00:53:38,740 --> 00:53:40,367
It's not that, but....

663
00:53:40,576 --> 00:53:43,067
You have problems, I know.

664
00:53:43,278 --> 00:53:46,509
I could help if you didn't
keep spurning me.

665
00:53:46,715 --> 00:53:49,582
That boy, for instance. Frédéric.

666
00:53:49,785 --> 00:53:53,721
If he talks, you've had it.
Shall I see to him?

667
00:54:12,241 --> 00:54:14,072
There's a lady here for you.

668
00:54:14,276 --> 00:54:17,040
I gave her some water.
She feels faint.

669
00:54:22,317 --> 00:54:24,308
Come on, don't stay here.

670
00:54:27,289 --> 00:54:31,055
Everyone saw me with you!
The whole city knows now!

671
00:54:31,260 --> 00:54:34,127
-Calm down.
-They know! I'm finished.

672
00:54:34,329 --> 00:54:36,729
I've brought your typewriter back.

673
00:54:38,267 --> 00:54:40,235
I'm so angry at Granddad.

674
00:54:40,435 --> 00:54:41,094
It's okay.

675
00:54:41,303 --> 00:54:44,602
He liked your book.
He'd love to read the rest.

676
00:54:47,776 --> 00:54:49,403
My head's spinning.

677
00:54:53,615 --> 00:54:54,741
Can I help?

678
00:54:59,922 --> 00:55:02,220
Here, take it. But I want it back!

679
00:55:03,292 --> 00:55:05,624
He'll be so-- My grandfather is--

680
00:55:15,938 --> 00:55:17,269
Are you all right?

681
00:56:23,405 --> 00:56:26,568
Some of us want to fight,
but others don't!

682
00:56:26,775 --> 00:56:30,905
We're all French here!
Spare me your lectures!

683
00:56:31,113 --> 00:56:33,547
-Our duty is to leave!
-To go where?

684
00:56:33,749 --> 00:56:35,876
North Africa, Algiers, Tunis.

685
00:56:36,084 --> 00:56:38,018
Go, then, and good luck to you!

686
00:56:38,220 --> 00:56:40,211
If you go, you'll go for good.

687
00:56:42,391 --> 00:56:43,619
Gentlemen!

688
00:56:45,227 --> 00:56:46,626
Please!

689
00:56:51,099 --> 00:56:54,728
We must fight the invader.
With our allies.

690
00:56:54,936 --> 00:56:57,996
National legitimacy is on our side!

691
00:56:58,206 --> 00:57:02,233
If you abandon the French to their fate,
they won't forget.

692
00:57:06,648 --> 00:57:09,583
You'll be deserters,
emigrants, traitors!

693
00:57:09,785 --> 00:57:10,752
Treason!

694
00:57:11,319 --> 00:57:15,016
The traitors are those
who leave to save our homeland...

695
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:18,488
...or who stay to bargain
with the enemy.

696
00:57:22,631 --> 00:57:25,429
Professor Kopolski? Excuse me.

697
00:57:25,801 --> 00:57:29,032
You may not remember me.
Alex Winckler.

698
00:57:29,971 --> 00:57:33,532
I interviewed you in Geneva,
after that conference.

699
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:35,869
Yes, that's right.

700
00:57:36,278 --> 00:57:38,246
Are you here for a few days?

701
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:41,010
Don't worry, it's not for my paper.

702
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:44,552
I'm prying.

703
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,447
Forgive me.

704
00:57:50,092 --> 00:57:53,653
When it comes to war,
all that counts is the word...

705
00:57:53,862 --> 00:57:55,659
...of great military men.

706
00:57:55,864 --> 00:58:00,028
If Marshal Pétain tells us
to lay down our arms...

707
00:58:00,435 --> 00:58:02,767
...we have to surrender!

708
00:58:23,992 --> 00:58:25,550
Who's this with me?

709
00:58:25,761 --> 00:58:26,728
Your brother.

710
00:58:28,196 --> 00:58:29,163
Antoine?

711
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:32,824
That's our garden!
Where was this taken from?

712
00:58:33,034 --> 00:58:34,228
My window.

713
00:58:34,436 --> 00:58:37,098
I don't believe it!
You were spying on me!

714
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:38,636
You knew I was.

715
00:58:45,480 --> 00:58:49,211
You have to leave, Frédéric.
They'll soon find you here.

716
00:58:49,417 --> 00:58:51,510
-You have to leave too.
-I can't.

717
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,153
You're in danger now.

718
00:58:54,222 --> 00:58:55,348
You said you were.

719
00:59:03,732 --> 00:59:06,792
Come with me. We'll leave together.

720
00:59:08,103 --> 00:59:09,070
To go where?

721
00:59:09,271 --> 00:59:11,637
I don't know. Far away.

722
00:59:13,575 --> 00:59:14,872
Far away.

723
00:59:15,076 --> 00:59:16,338
To Portugal.

724
00:59:16,878 --> 00:59:19,278
We can get visas.
Other people have.

725
00:59:20,615 --> 00:59:21,741
What will we do?

726
00:59:21,950 --> 00:59:24,475
We could move on
to South America.

727
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,653
Mexico?

728
00:59:25,854 --> 00:59:27,185
Mexico if you want.

729
00:59:27,389 --> 00:59:29,084
They've offered me films.

730
00:59:29,291 --> 00:59:32,385
You see! lmagine the riot
if you turn up!

731
00:59:35,564 --> 00:59:37,054
What will you do?

732
00:59:37,265 --> 00:59:40,393
I'll give classes,
I'll finish my book.

733
00:59:41,069 --> 00:59:44,197
Your book?
Don't tell me it's still the same one.

734
00:59:44,406 --> 00:59:45,373
It is.

735
00:59:47,242 --> 00:59:51,178
It's finished now!
I just need to tidy up a few loose ends.

736
00:59:51,746 --> 00:59:53,338
Did you see that publisher?

737
00:59:53,548 --> 00:59:54,242
Which one?

738
00:59:54,449 --> 00:59:55,848
The one I found for you.

739
00:59:56,051 --> 00:59:57,018
He's a crook.

740
00:59:57,219 --> 00:59:58,186
Really?

741
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:04,586
If you become famous,
I could publish your poems.

742
01:00:04,793 --> 01:00:06,055
What poems?

743
01:00:06,261 --> 01:00:09,287
The ones you slipped
through my shutters.

744
01:00:09,497 --> 01:00:10,862
You've forgotten?

745
01:00:11,066 --> 01:00:12,090
You kept them?

746
01:00:12,300 --> 01:00:13,665
Of course.

747
01:01:02,884 --> 01:01:06,320
I'm going to disappoint you,
but try to understand.

748
01:01:06,521 --> 01:01:10,890
My colleagues and I can't let you
take the heavy water to England.

749
01:01:11,092 --> 01:01:12,150
But you said--

750
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:16,353
I was wrong. It must stay here,
in the national interest.

751
01:01:16,564 --> 01:01:18,930
The Germans will take it to Germany.

752
01:01:19,134 --> 01:01:21,159
We'll put it in a safe place.

753
01:01:21,369 --> 01:01:23,735
Everyone knows
we have to negotiate.

754
01:01:23,939 --> 01:01:25,270
Within hours, even.

755
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:28,169
-With the Germans?
-Not the Chinese!

756
01:01:28,677 --> 01:01:31,009
We can't compromise the truce.

757
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:34,205
That's the cost of peace.

758
01:01:34,416 --> 01:01:35,405
Peace.

759
01:01:36,017 --> 01:01:38,315
It could be a bargaining chip for us.

760
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:42,012
The heavy water
as a gesture of goodwill?

761
01:01:42,223 --> 01:01:45,021
I told you,
we'll put it in a safe place.

762
01:01:45,226 --> 01:01:48,059
They'll find it. They're not idiots.

763
01:01:48,263 --> 01:01:49,457
Oh, please!

764
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,723
What about the professor?

765
01:01:51,933 --> 01:01:54,902
Is a stateless Jew
part of the package?

766
01:01:59,908 --> 01:02:00,875
Be quiet!

767
01:02:01,076 --> 01:02:03,306
That's complicity with the enemy!

768
01:02:04,346 --> 01:02:05,608
Stand aside!

769
01:02:07,382 --> 01:02:08,747
Shame on you!

770
01:02:08,950 --> 01:02:11,009
You know what the Germans will do!

771
01:02:11,219 --> 01:02:13,517
They'll make a bomb!
An atom bomb!

772
01:02:40,782 --> 01:02:43,876
They're confused.
They don't know what to do.

773
01:02:44,085 --> 01:02:46,952
Don't be so indulgent.
They know you're at risk.

774
01:02:47,155 --> 01:02:48,884
Yes, maybe.

775
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:52,355
It's too late to bother
with people's motives now.

776
01:03:00,602 --> 01:03:01,591
Leave us alone.

777
01:03:01,803 --> 01:03:04,738
Listen, I never expected it
to come to this.

778
01:03:05,173 --> 01:03:07,937
They're capitulating.
I'm ashamed too.

779
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:09,937
About that boat--

780
01:03:10,145 --> 01:03:12,113
It's too late now!

781
01:03:16,317 --> 01:03:18,148
-Where will you go?
-Bayonne.

782
01:03:18,353 --> 01:03:21,914
There are roadblocks.
Don't bring your car out.

783
01:03:22,123 --> 01:03:23,715
You found a garage?

784
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,392
It's in the street?

785
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:30,189
What's wrong?

786
01:03:31,132 --> 01:03:33,032
It's going to be impounded.

787
01:03:56,357 --> 01:03:58,188
Hey, don't smash everything!

788
01:03:58,393 --> 01:03:59,621
Just looking.

789
01:04:03,064 --> 01:04:04,759
-What is it?
-Pichon-Longueville.

790
01:04:04,966 --> 01:04:06,524
-What vintage?
-'28.

791
01:04:06,734 --> 01:04:08,099
Wow!

792
01:04:08,303 --> 01:04:09,270
Let me see!

793
01:04:13,508 --> 01:04:15,203
Who'll buy that now?

794
01:04:15,410 --> 01:04:17,605
You're crazy! We hold on to it.

795
01:04:17,812 --> 01:04:20,508
If the war lasts,
we'll be rolling in it!

796
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,672
What are you doing? Raoul!

797
01:04:49,844 --> 01:04:51,368
Come over here.

798
01:04:54,849 --> 01:04:55,838
I'll fetch her.

799
01:04:56,050 --> 01:04:57,347
No, I'm all right.

800
01:04:57,552 --> 01:04:59,543
-Where are you going?
-Stay here.

801
01:04:59,754 --> 01:05:01,551
-Who is he?
-A scientist.

802
01:05:04,392 --> 01:05:06,019
Excuse me.

803
01:05:06,227 --> 01:05:08,787
Can you see my hat anywhere?

804
01:05:27,482 --> 01:05:28,915
It's broken down.

805
01:05:29,117 --> 01:05:30,414
That's right.

806
01:05:30,618 --> 01:05:32,017
We can't move it.

807
01:05:32,220 --> 01:05:33,482
That's enough, miss.

808
01:05:51,105 --> 01:05:54,472
No! That's second gear!
You'll stall it!

809
01:05:54,676 --> 01:05:56,303
First gear's at the top.

810
01:05:56,511 --> 01:05:58,069
You'll stall it!

811
01:06:11,859 --> 01:06:13,258
What's going on?

812
01:06:23,137 --> 01:06:25,469
Professor Kopolski,
Collège de France.

813
01:06:25,673 --> 01:06:28,107
Where are you taking my car?

814
01:06:28,309 --> 01:06:29,276
To police HQ.

815
01:06:29,477 --> 01:06:31,809
Let me see a written order.

816
01:06:38,019 --> 01:06:40,146
Stop! You'll wreck the gears!

817
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:17,590
They've lost them.

818
01:07:24,866 --> 01:07:26,800
We have to let Berlin know.

819
01:07:49,724 --> 01:07:50,884
You're in physics?

820
01:07:53,394 --> 01:07:54,759
I'd have liked that.

821
01:07:54,962 --> 01:07:58,454
Those little tubes, the bubbles,
water turning red....

822
01:07:58,666 --> 01:08:00,657
That's more like chemistry.

823
01:08:01,269 --> 01:08:02,531
It's not the same?

824
01:08:02,737 --> 01:08:03,795
Here they come!

825
01:08:17,151 --> 01:08:18,140
My friends!

826
01:08:21,489 --> 01:08:24,515
Are you all right, Camille?
You're not hurt?

827
01:08:24,726 --> 01:08:26,091
No, I'm all right.

828
01:08:26,294 --> 01:08:27,852
You too, Mr. Girard?

829
01:08:28,062 --> 01:08:29,859
No, look what he's done!

830
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,998
Who's going to mend this?

831
01:08:34,402 --> 01:08:35,391
Auger!

832
01:08:36,003 --> 01:08:37,265
Time to go, Raoul.

833
01:08:37,472 --> 01:08:38,871
Just a second!

834
01:08:39,474 --> 01:08:40,702
Madame Arbesault!

835
01:08:40,908 --> 01:08:42,500
Can you send my pal down?

836
01:08:42,710 --> 01:08:43,699
He went out.

837
01:08:43,911 --> 01:08:44,878
For long?

838
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:47,070
I don't know. He was with a lady.

839
01:08:47,281 --> 01:08:48,248
An actress?

840
01:08:48,449 --> 01:08:50,212
I think so.

841
01:08:51,252 --> 01:08:52,219
He's here too?

842
01:08:52,420 --> 01:08:54,251
Auger? Yes, we stick together.

843
01:08:54,455 --> 01:08:56,218
Guess who was here!

844
01:08:56,424 --> 01:08:58,153
-Who?
-Her! Auger's girl!

845
01:08:58,359 --> 01:08:59,189
No kidding!

846
01:08:59,394 --> 01:09:01,726
His ex. She's with a minister now.

847
01:09:01,929 --> 01:09:05,228
I know. They were having
lunch together earlier.

848
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:06,900
All three of them?

849
01:09:07,635 --> 01:09:09,262
Would you believe it!

850
01:09:09,837 --> 01:09:12,965
Poor Auger,
she's pulling his strings.

851
01:09:13,174 --> 01:09:14,869
She has been for years.

852
01:09:17,011 --> 01:09:19,946
Did he tell you
how he was almost arrested?

853
01:09:20,148 --> 01:09:21,115
He was?

854
01:09:21,315 --> 01:09:22,680
You knew he was in jail?

855
01:09:22,884 --> 01:09:27,048
And escaped? Sure, I was with him.
Lucky for him I was!

856
01:09:28,823 --> 01:09:31,690
That's how it goes. We're outlaws.

857
01:09:31,893 --> 01:09:33,360
So are you now.

858
01:09:33,561 --> 01:09:35,358
Mr. Girard and the professor too.

859
01:09:35,563 --> 01:09:37,758
It's best to stick together.

860
01:09:37,965 --> 01:09:40,661
It'll make it easier for the police.

861
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:43,334
I'll be back later.

862
01:09:43,871 --> 01:09:45,498
We'll have dinner, okay?

863
01:09:54,682 --> 01:09:57,674
The consulate opens at 8.
I'll be there.

864
01:09:57,885 --> 01:10:01,252
I know who did their visas.
He can help me.

865
01:10:01,456 --> 01:10:02,946
I'll call you after.

866
01:10:08,529 --> 01:10:11,054
I'd best keep away from the hotel.

867
01:10:11,265 --> 01:10:12,823
Fetch me your passport.

868
01:10:13,434 --> 01:10:15,129
You want me to come?

869
01:10:15,336 --> 01:10:16,303
What is it?

870
01:10:16,504 --> 01:10:19,905
I can't leave. You know I can't.
We're dreaming.

871
01:10:20,107 --> 01:10:22,337
-I can't leave.
-You have no choice.

872
01:10:22,543 --> 01:10:24,033
You forget whom I live with.

873
01:10:26,581 --> 01:10:28,811
-You're counting on him?
-He'll protect me.

874
01:10:29,016 --> 01:10:31,917
You must go, though!
You can't live in hiding.

875
01:10:32,119 --> 01:10:35,520
Wire me from Lisbon.
Don't sign, I'll know it's you.

876
01:10:35,723 --> 01:10:37,588
Do you have money?

877
01:10:37,792 --> 01:10:40,522
I'll fetch some.
Where are you going?

878
01:10:44,632 --> 01:10:45,621
Leave me be!

879
01:10:46,968 --> 01:10:48,731
Is it because of Jean-Etienne?

880
01:10:50,438 --> 01:10:53,601
Forget him.
You'll dump him after using him...

881
01:10:53,808 --> 01:10:55,901
...like every other man in your life!

882
01:10:56,110 --> 01:10:58,544
You don't even love yourself.

883
01:10:58,746 --> 01:11:00,714
You'll end up alone with your mirror!

884
01:12:20,828 --> 01:12:21,954
Miss Denvert!

885
01:12:24,966 --> 01:12:26,365
I'm Thierry Arpel.

886
01:12:26,567 --> 01:12:29,661
Sorry about that fuss earlier.
I had no choice.

887
01:12:29,870 --> 01:12:33,431
Weren't you surprised
to see Frédéric Auger here?

888
01:12:33,641 --> 01:12:36,769
-Everyone's here.
-But he should be in jail.

889
01:12:36,978 --> 01:12:38,843
-So I heard.
-You heard?

890
01:12:39,246 --> 01:12:40,804
I don't have time now.

891
01:12:44,418 --> 01:12:45,817
Is Mr. Beaufort here?

892
01:12:46,387 --> 01:12:48,878
-He's at the prefecture.
-Again? Why?

893
01:12:49,090 --> 01:12:50,489
The premier resigned.

894
01:12:50,691 --> 01:12:52,386
Who's replacing him?

895
01:12:52,593 --> 01:12:54,458
Marshal Pétain.

896
01:12:55,596 --> 01:12:57,496
-What's happening?
-An air raid.

897
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:03,694
My uncle's love of actresses
killed him!

898
01:13:03,904 --> 01:13:04,871
Leave me alone.

899
01:13:05,072 --> 01:13:07,006
What a beautiful way to die!

900
01:13:07,208 --> 01:13:10,473
I wouldn't mind it either.
I love actresses too.

901
01:13:10,678 --> 01:13:12,543
Dying in a star's arms....

902
01:13:13,547 --> 01:13:15,947
My uncle's mistress....
Why not mine?

903
01:13:29,463 --> 01:13:30,521
Excuse me.

904
01:13:30,731 --> 01:13:34,724
I'm looking for a friend
who might be staying here.

905
01:13:34,935 --> 01:13:37,836
His name's Kopolski,
Professor Kopolski.

906
01:13:39,040 --> 01:13:42,373
He's with a young woman,
a brunette, 25--

907
01:13:49,050 --> 01:13:50,017
Let go!

908
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:53,345
How did he seduce you all?
Aren't I just as good?

909
01:13:53,888 --> 01:13:55,150
Do you mind!

910
01:14:03,164 --> 01:14:05,530
Thank you, Alex!
What a horrible man!

911
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:06,700
Who is he?

912
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:09,199
Some maniac who's obsessed
with me.

913
01:14:09,403 --> 01:14:11,667
Don't worry, we'll see to him.

914
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:15,503
He'll stay away now.

915
01:14:16,177 --> 01:14:17,269
Coming back?

916
01:14:20,347 --> 01:14:22,008
I'll wait for you!

917
01:15:14,635 --> 01:15:15,624
You're here?

918
01:15:15,836 --> 01:15:18,566
It was your friend Raoul who--

919
01:15:18,773 --> 01:15:20,001
Who what?

920
01:15:20,207 --> 01:15:23,370
Who saved our hides. So to speak.
You were no use.

921
01:15:23,577 --> 01:15:24,544
What?

922
01:15:24,745 --> 01:15:25,803
You said you'd help.

923
01:15:26,013 --> 01:15:28,982
That minister of yours
was supposed to help...

924
01:15:29,183 --> 01:15:31,845
...but we almost got arrested
and had to run...

925
01:15:32,052 --> 01:15:35,488
...like common crooks!
All because of you, thanks a lot!

926
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:45,155
What can I say? I'm devastated.

927
01:15:45,366 --> 01:15:46,594
It's all my fault!

928
01:15:46,801 --> 01:15:50,168
Why did I listen to you?
That bastard!

929
01:15:50,371 --> 01:15:51,429
What bastard?

930
01:15:51,639 --> 01:15:53,129
Beaufort!

931
01:15:53,340 --> 01:15:56,537
I should've refused!
Now you're mad at me.

932
01:15:56,744 --> 01:15:58,507
-I can tell.
-You couldn't know.

933
01:15:58,712 --> 01:16:01,010
It was obvious. Look at his career.

934
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,847
He changes sides all the time.

935
01:16:04,051 --> 01:16:07,782
I ask him to help you,
and he sends the police!

936
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:21,365
What can you do now?

937
01:16:21,569 --> 01:16:22,627
I don't know.

938
01:16:23,904 --> 01:16:25,235
You can't give up!

939
01:16:25,439 --> 01:16:27,430
The professor needs to rest.

940
01:16:27,641 --> 01:16:30,132
-Not forever!
-Don't say that!

941
01:16:30,611 --> 01:16:31,737
I'm sorry.

942
01:16:35,416 --> 01:16:36,974
He still wants to leave?

943
01:16:38,819 --> 01:16:41,447
There must be a way.
Shall I see to it?

944
01:16:41,655 --> 01:16:44,419
-No, thank you.
-Let me! I know I can.

945
01:16:44,625 --> 01:16:45,887
There's no need.

946
01:16:46,093 --> 01:16:49,859
See, you are mad at me.
You don't trust me now!

947
01:16:50,664 --> 01:16:52,097
You've lied a lot.

948
01:16:52,299 --> 01:16:54,028
-When?
-All the time.

949
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:55,930
Starting on the train.

950
01:16:56,136 --> 01:16:58,502
Should I have said I was in jail?

951
01:16:59,673 --> 01:17:01,402
I always prefer the truth.

952
01:17:01,609 --> 01:17:03,236
What do you want to know?

953
01:17:03,444 --> 01:17:05,002
Nothing. Not now.

954
01:17:05,946 --> 01:17:08,414
You call me a liar. Let me explain.

955
01:17:08,616 --> 01:17:12,108
All right, but later. My head aches.
You keep shouting.

956
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:14,184
I don't like liars or drunks.

957
01:17:14,388 --> 01:17:16,754
Nor crooks?
They said I killed a man?

958
01:17:17,958 --> 01:17:18,982
You believed it?

959
01:17:19,193 --> 01:17:20,251
Well, you were in jail!

960
01:17:22,029 --> 01:17:23,121
That's too easy!

961
01:17:23,330 --> 01:17:25,423
Let me tell you the whole story.

962
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:28,625
Should I try calling Bayonne?

963
01:17:28,836 --> 01:17:30,394
Sure, call Bayonne!

964
01:17:31,005 --> 01:17:32,632
What's wrong with you?

965
01:17:49,223 --> 01:17:52,624
Marshal, your nomination
was applauded...

966
01:17:52,826 --> 01:17:56,023
...by most of our embassies
on hearing the news.

967
01:17:56,230 --> 01:17:57,288
We have received...

968
01:17:57,498 --> 01:17:59,625
...telegrams of support.

969
01:18:12,413 --> 01:18:13,402
Excuse me.

970
01:18:17,551 --> 01:18:19,178
Are you totally witless?

971
01:18:19,386 --> 01:18:21,377
-I had to see you.
-Not now!

972
01:18:21,588 --> 01:18:23,954
I had to. It's about Frédéric Auger.

973
01:18:24,158 --> 01:18:26,683
-What now?
-He didn't do anything.

974
01:18:26,894 --> 01:18:28,862
-Call the police off.
-Why?

975
01:18:29,063 --> 01:18:32,590
Because it was me. I killed Arpel.

976
01:18:55,723 --> 01:18:58,021
You really think I'm a killer?

977
01:19:09,470 --> 01:19:10,698
That woman.

978
01:19:12,239 --> 01:19:13,866
Is it all to do with her?

979
01:19:14,074 --> 01:19:15,098
What woman?

980
01:19:15,309 --> 01:19:16,708
You know who.

981
01:19:20,147 --> 01:19:22,138
You've known her for years.

982
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:26,018
-Forever, even.
-Who said that?

983
01:19:26,220 --> 01:19:27,619
-Your friend.
-Raoul?

984
01:19:27,821 --> 01:19:30,346
What nerve! What has he told you?

985
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:32,024
It's not a secret.

986
01:19:35,496 --> 01:19:37,589
-It can't be easy.
-What?

987
01:19:39,133 --> 01:19:40,930
Loving a woman like her.

988
01:19:43,137 --> 01:19:45,264
What about you?
Ever loved anyone?

989
01:19:47,641 --> 01:19:48,608
Who?

990
01:19:49,309 --> 01:19:50,401
That's my business.

991
01:19:50,611 --> 01:19:52,977
You won't answer my questions?

992
01:19:53,847 --> 01:19:56,179
-Not about myself.
-I noticed.

993
01:19:56,383 --> 01:19:58,283
-This young man--
-Which one?

994
01:19:58,485 --> 01:20:00,612
-The one you love.
-Says who?

995
01:20:01,522 --> 01:20:03,422
An older man, then.

996
01:20:04,124 --> 01:20:05,250
The professor!

997
01:20:05,459 --> 01:20:06,517
You're mad!

998
01:20:07,494 --> 01:20:09,587
Don't go. Forgive me. I'm stupid.

999
01:20:09,797 --> 01:20:11,765
Stay! I'll stop pestering you.

1000
01:20:21,775 --> 01:20:23,675
Why? Why tonight?

1001
01:20:23,877 --> 01:20:26,641
The night of decision. War or peace!

1002
01:20:26,847 --> 01:20:31,216
The world's eyes are on us,
and I'm caught up in a crime!

1003
01:20:31,418 --> 01:20:33,852
Not a crime!
It was self-defense!

1004
01:20:34,054 --> 01:20:35,681
People won't call it that!

1005
01:20:35,889 --> 01:20:36,878
No one knows!

1006
01:20:37,458 --> 01:20:40,359
Four people do!
You, me, Auger and young Arpel!

1007
01:20:40,561 --> 01:20:42,791
-Frédéric won't talk.
-Arpel could!

1008
01:20:42,996 --> 01:20:45,430
-Actually, I thought--
-What?

1009
01:20:45,632 --> 01:20:48,123
That you could have him arrested.

1010
01:20:48,335 --> 01:20:49,063
What for?

1011
01:20:49,269 --> 01:20:51,533
He's a sex maniac. Like his uncle!

1012
01:20:51,738 --> 01:20:53,171
You're insane!

1013
01:20:53,373 --> 01:20:54,965
As interior minister--

1014
01:20:55,175 --> 01:20:58,076
I should pervert justice?
You're raving mad!

1015
01:21:22,503 --> 01:21:23,765
Don't cry.

1016
01:21:25,239 --> 01:21:28,208
Don't cry.
Nothing will happen to you.

1017
01:21:29,743 --> 01:21:32,678
I'll close the case.
No one will suspect you.

1018
01:21:33,580 --> 01:21:34,512
And Frédéric?

1019
01:21:34,715 --> 01:21:35,682
Oh, really!

1020
01:21:40,387 --> 01:21:42,218
All right, I'll try.

1021
01:22:02,109 --> 01:22:03,599
May l?

1022
01:22:03,810 --> 01:22:04,777
Get Bayonne?

1023
01:22:04,978 --> 01:22:07,446
Yes, but no one knows anything there.

1024
01:22:07,648 --> 01:22:10,116
-Why Bayonne?
-To find an English boat.

1025
01:22:10,317 --> 01:22:12,615
-Why go so far?
-There are none here.

1026
01:22:12,819 --> 01:22:14,309
No, but I'm sure that....

1027
01:22:15,455 --> 01:22:16,285
Hold on.

1028
01:22:16,490 --> 01:22:18,082
-What?
-Come on.

1029
01:22:27,401 --> 01:22:31,098
You see these serious faces?
France is vanquished...

1030
01:22:31,305 --> 01:22:34,706
...but perhaps she deserved it
for her laxity.

1031
01:22:34,908 --> 01:22:36,603
We must build a new France.

1032
01:22:36,810 --> 01:22:38,505
Is this your next speech?

1033
01:22:38,712 --> 01:22:40,407
Don't mock. I'm worried.

1034
01:22:41,048 --> 01:22:42,515
Worried about us.

1035
01:22:42,716 --> 01:22:44,741
We're moving toward a new age...

1036
01:22:44,952 --> 01:22:48,581
...and I fear it won't suit you.
There have been hints.

1037
01:22:48,789 --> 01:22:50,654
Hints about what?

1038
01:22:50,857 --> 01:22:52,518
You can guess.

1039
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:55,353
People disapprove of our affair.

1040
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:57,753
It will become impossible.

1041
01:22:57,965 --> 01:23:00,126
It tears me apart to say it.

1042
01:23:02,669 --> 01:23:04,899
I'll never forget our happy times.

1043
01:23:11,778 --> 01:23:13,040
Minister.

1044
01:23:14,982 --> 01:23:16,313
They're waiting.

1045
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:19,415
I'm coming.

1046
01:23:44,077 --> 01:23:45,066
The English?

1047
01:23:45,279 --> 01:23:47,440
They just left, round the corner.

1048
01:24:07,367 --> 01:24:08,493
Mr. Brémond!

1049
01:24:09,202 --> 01:24:10,669
Can you give me a lift?

1050
01:24:10,871 --> 01:24:12,896
-Actually, I have to--
-It's not far.

1051
01:24:13,106 --> 01:24:15,973
Please. Look at the state I'm in!

1052
01:24:23,083 --> 01:24:25,677
We called the airfield again.

1053
01:24:25,886 --> 01:24:27,820
Takeoff's at 7, general.

1054
01:24:28,722 --> 01:24:30,485
You'll reach London by noon.

1055
01:24:36,963 --> 01:24:38,726
Come on, Albert! I'm ready.

1056
01:24:38,932 --> 01:24:39,899
Any news?

1057
01:24:40,100 --> 01:24:41,897
The marshal has capitulated.

1058
01:24:42,102 --> 01:24:44,696
-Thank God. At last!
-Hear that?

1059
01:24:44,905 --> 01:24:46,395
The armistice.

1060
01:24:46,606 --> 01:24:49,666
-We'll soon be back in Paris!
-With the Germans.

1061
01:24:49,876 --> 01:24:51,070
We'll make do.

1062
01:24:51,278 --> 01:24:54,008
Make do without us.
We're off to Nice.

1063
01:25:14,601 --> 01:25:17,195
Darling, you'll catch your death!

1064
01:25:17,404 --> 01:25:19,338
-You're leaving tomorrow?
-No, now.

1065
01:25:19,539 --> 01:25:21,131
-Can you take me?
-To Nice?

1066
01:25:21,341 --> 01:25:24,606
You have a room for me there.
I can't stay here.

1067
01:25:24,811 --> 01:25:26,904
I'll have my bags sent down.

1068
01:25:27,114 --> 01:25:31,278
But the car's full. I have five cases,
plus a trunk on the roof.

1069
01:25:31,785 --> 01:25:34,948
Doesn't the government
have any drivers left?

1070
01:25:35,522 --> 01:25:36,784
Thanks a lot.

1071
01:25:45,098 --> 01:25:47,965
I totally approve. Let her manage.

1072
01:26:05,318 --> 01:26:07,149
See, I didn't break anything.

1073
01:26:07,354 --> 01:26:10,721
The reverse gear keeps jamming,
after your acrobatics!

1074
01:26:10,924 --> 01:26:12,824
The professor has to leave.

1075
01:26:13,026 --> 01:26:13,993
For where?

1076
01:26:14,194 --> 01:26:19,029
Soulac, at the end of the estuary.
He leaves at dawn to catch a boat.

1077
01:26:19,232 --> 01:26:21,325
-Is it far?
-Seventy miles.

1078
01:26:21,535 --> 01:26:22,797
You'll make it.

1079
01:26:23,003 --> 01:26:27,337
I can't go with them.
I'm waiting for Mother to call.

1080
01:26:27,541 --> 01:26:28,701
So who's driving?

1081
01:26:28,909 --> 01:26:30,308
Mr. Auger.

1082
01:26:38,351 --> 01:26:41,912
Le Taillan is here.
There's only one road.

1083
01:26:42,122 --> 01:26:45,523
From there,
follow the signs to Castelnau.

1084
01:26:45,725 --> 01:26:47,693
I can't turn my back on you!

1085
01:26:47,894 --> 01:26:51,990
After Castelnau, head for Lesparre,
through the forest.

1086
01:26:52,199 --> 01:26:56,158
At Saint-Vivien, make sure
you take the right road to Soulac.

1087
01:26:56,369 --> 01:26:57,358
All right.

1088
01:26:57,571 --> 01:26:59,539
Let me drive them.

1089
01:26:59,739 --> 01:27:02,503
-It's okay.
-Do you know how to drive?

1090
01:27:04,077 --> 01:27:07,137
Seventy miles in the dark,
for God's sake!

1091
01:27:07,347 --> 01:27:09,110
He'll wrap you around a tree.

1092
01:27:10,116 --> 01:27:13,745
Do you even have the right papers
for the boat?

1093
01:27:13,954 --> 01:27:15,979
It's English, not French.

1094
01:27:16,957 --> 01:27:19,187
-Time to go.
-I'm ready.

1095
01:27:25,198 --> 01:27:27,063
Children, come here!

1096
01:27:33,540 --> 01:27:35,167
Camille, my briefcase!

1097
01:27:35,375 --> 01:27:37,138
-Where?
-In the hallway.

1098
01:27:39,746 --> 01:27:42,977
You'd have left
without saying goodbye? I'm hurt.

1099
01:27:43,183 --> 01:27:44,844
Weren't we having dinner?

1100
01:27:46,586 --> 01:27:48,053
I brought this.

1101
01:27:48,588 --> 01:27:49,680
Pauillac.

1102
01:27:51,458 --> 01:27:53,153
Thanks, but....

1103
01:28:05,672 --> 01:28:08,436
Let me take them.
I'm not asking much.

1104
01:28:08,642 --> 01:28:10,234
I saved the girl's life.

1105
01:28:10,443 --> 01:28:12,377
She's not even your type.

1106
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:13,876
Get off my back!

1107
01:28:14,481 --> 01:28:17,814
Need them all, do you?
Where would you be without me?

1108
01:28:18,018 --> 01:28:19,383
Is that your truck?

1109
01:28:19,586 --> 01:28:21,213
You'll have to move it.

1110
01:28:31,197 --> 01:28:33,222
Lower! That's the heating!

1111
01:28:34,367 --> 01:28:36,927
You're leaving?
Here's your manuscript.

1112
01:28:37,470 --> 01:28:38,596
I made some notes.

1113
01:28:38,805 --> 01:28:41,831
I hope they're clear.
They're mostly about syntax.

1114
01:28:42,042 --> 01:28:43,509
It's a beautiful book.

1115
01:28:43,710 --> 01:28:47,202
Especially the last part.
The theater, the actress.

1116
01:28:47,414 --> 01:28:49,211
The woman trapped by her lies.

1117
01:28:49,416 --> 01:28:52,544
She's a fascinating character.
How can I put it?

1118
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:16,798
This is absurd.
What's the big rush?

1119
01:29:17,010 --> 01:29:18,978
-What will you do in Nice?
-I told you.

1120
01:29:19,179 --> 01:29:22,808
It will all be over soon.
I can take you back to Paris.

1121
01:29:29,356 --> 01:29:30,721
Come on, come on.

1122
01:29:30,924 --> 01:29:32,118
Stop, perfect.

1123
01:29:39,232 --> 01:29:40,358
You're leaving?

1124
01:29:40,867 --> 01:29:42,892
-I'm going too.
-Where?

1125
01:29:43,103 --> 01:29:46,470
To stay with friends in Nice.
But their car's full.

1126
01:29:46,673 --> 01:29:48,538
And Alex has to work.

1127
01:29:50,944 --> 01:29:52,343
Could you take me?

1128
01:29:52,545 --> 01:29:53,569
To Nice?

1129
01:29:53,780 --> 01:29:55,247
It's out of your way?

1130
01:29:55,448 --> 01:29:57,040
Where are you going?

1131
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:58,842
Perhaps I'm prying?

1132
01:29:59,052 --> 01:30:00,178
On holiday.

1133
01:30:00,387 --> 01:30:02,116
Really? Where?

1134
01:30:24,911 --> 01:30:28,870
Listen to me. I've left Jean-Etienne.
I told him everything.

1135
01:30:29,082 --> 01:30:31,915
I told him I did it. You're safe now.

1136
01:30:46,332 --> 01:30:48,994
Do you know where they're going?

1137
01:30:50,570 --> 01:30:52,504
To Soulac, to catch a boat.

1138
01:30:53,506 --> 01:30:57,169
Excuse me.
Is there a telephone here?

1139
01:30:57,377 --> 01:31:00,107
Don't leave me.
I don't know what to do.

1140
01:31:00,680 --> 01:31:03,547
I'm totally lost. Can't you see that?

1141
01:31:05,185 --> 01:31:07,210
I'm tired, Frédéric.

1142
01:31:28,508 --> 01:31:31,807
This will make your day.
You can drive them.

1143
01:31:32,779 --> 01:31:34,212
Whatever you say.

1144
01:31:41,521 --> 01:31:42,579
You're not coming?

1145
01:31:45,525 --> 01:31:47,390
She needs you, is that it?

1146
01:31:48,561 --> 01:31:51,928
Yes, I have to help her.
I have no choice.

1147
01:32:19,659 --> 01:32:20,683
Oh, sorry.

1148
01:32:20,894 --> 01:32:22,191
I won't be long.

1149
01:32:22,395 --> 01:32:25,592
I hope not.
This isn't the telephone exchange!

1150
01:32:30,703 --> 01:32:32,967
Mr. Girard!
Can you understand German?

1151
01:32:33,173 --> 01:32:34,140
A bit.

1152
01:32:34,340 --> 01:32:35,705
Come here!

1153
01:32:52,225 --> 01:32:54,921
You can write in the garden in Nice.

1154
01:32:55,128 --> 01:32:56,823
They have a big place.

1155
01:32:57,030 --> 01:33:00,591
They won't bother us.
A writer will make them look good.

1156
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:02,563
-I won't be staying.
-Why?

1157
01:33:02,769 --> 01:33:05,533
Because it's over.
The house, the garden....

1158
01:33:05,738 --> 01:33:07,706
You don't believe it yourself.

1159
01:33:07,907 --> 01:33:09,204
I'll take you there.

1160
01:33:09,409 --> 01:33:11,502
That's the last thing I'll do for you.

1161
01:33:14,747 --> 01:33:16,237
You no longer love me.

1162
01:33:21,621 --> 01:33:23,020
It's my fault.

1163
01:33:24,257 --> 01:33:26,350
My dreams have ruined your life.

1164
01:33:26,559 --> 01:33:27,821
Mr. Auger!

1165
01:33:29,395 --> 01:33:30,828
Help!

1166
01:33:31,731 --> 01:33:33,528
Hurry! He'll kill him!

1167
01:33:33,733 --> 01:33:34,563
Who?

1168
01:33:34,767 --> 01:33:36,029
He's a spy!

1169
01:33:49,649 --> 01:33:50,616
Hold it!

1170
01:33:50,817 --> 01:33:52,785
You're not in Nice yet?

1171
01:34:28,054 --> 01:34:29,112
Who?

1172
01:34:29,622 --> 01:34:31,351
Yes, he's right here.

1173
01:34:31,557 --> 01:34:33,115
It's your mother.

1174
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:35,788
Hello, Mother.

1175
01:34:36,462 --> 01:34:38,054
I'm all right.

1176
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:15,931
What's the book about?

1177
01:35:16,903 --> 01:35:18,336
Is it about her?

1178
01:35:18,871 --> 01:35:20,634
I'm just reading the notes.

1179
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:22,637
You're being indiscreet.

1180
01:35:22,842 --> 01:35:24,469
It's interesting. Listen.

1181
01:35:24,677 --> 01:35:28,135
"These notes cannot disguise
one basic fact:

1182
01:35:28,348 --> 01:35:32,808
You're going to take your place
among the writers who matter.

1183
01:35:33,019 --> 01:35:34,782
There aren't that many."

1184
01:35:35,888 --> 01:35:37,287
How about that!

1185
01:35:51,804 --> 01:35:55,069
They know everything!
Soulac, the boat, the car.

1186
01:35:55,274 --> 01:35:57,003
Even the professor's name!

1187
01:37:09,348 --> 01:37:10,315
What's going on?

1188
01:37:16,456 --> 01:37:17,286
The police!

1189
01:37:36,075 --> 01:37:37,007
Germans!

1190
01:39:37,797 --> 01:39:39,890
-Where are they?
-Over there. Come on.

1191
01:42:30,970 --> 01:42:32,369
Are you all right?

1192
01:42:50,122 --> 01:42:51,714
Camille, my dear...

1193
01:42:53,192 --> 01:42:54,318
...here we are.

1194
01:42:54,527 --> 01:42:56,518
We'll talk about this one day...

1195
01:42:56,729 --> 01:42:58,321
...l hope.

1196
01:43:11,410 --> 01:43:12,536
Why not come too?

1197
01:43:12,745 --> 01:43:14,804
What? You're going as well?

1198
01:43:16,816 --> 01:43:18,875
When did you decide that?

1199
01:43:19,084 --> 01:43:20,278
Just now.

1200
01:43:21,253 --> 01:43:24,654
I can't. It's impossible.
My life is here.

1201
01:43:25,591 --> 01:43:26,615
What life?

1202
01:43:28,761 --> 01:43:30,023
What will you do?

1203
01:43:30,229 --> 01:43:31,787
Whatever I can.

1204
01:43:37,236 --> 01:43:38,294
Goodbye, Camille.

1205
01:44:55,848 --> 01:44:56,940
Can you imagine...

1206
01:44:57,149 --> 01:45:00,084
...life in Nice?
With all those old ladies?

1207
01:45:00,286 --> 01:45:01,514
Honestly!

1208
01:45:02,121 --> 01:45:05,090
In Paris, things will soon
be back to normal.

1209
01:45:05,291 --> 01:45:06,280
You think so?

1210
01:45:06,492 --> 01:45:07,789
Of course!

1211
01:45:07,993 --> 01:45:09,585
Trust me.

1212
01:45:38,557 --> 01:45:39,888
Don't worry.

1213
01:46:30,843 --> 01:46:34,244
Paris, April 28, 1 942

1214
01:47:10,716 --> 01:47:11,944
Not here.

1215
01:47:12,151 --> 01:47:13,584
Read it later.

1216
01:47:14,286 --> 01:47:16,481
There's a note for Mr. Girard too.

1217
01:47:19,058 --> 01:47:21,356
-You saw him?
-The professor?

1218
01:47:21,560 --> 01:47:24,256
Last Monday, in Cambridge.
In his lab.

1219
01:47:28,133 --> 01:47:30,601
Is this your first time back?

1220
01:47:33,439 --> 01:47:34,838
Were you...?

1221
01:47:35,941 --> 01:47:37,568
Were you parachuted in?

1222
01:47:39,078 --> 01:47:40,409
Near Chartres?

1223
01:47:41,613 --> 01:47:42,841
How do you know?

1224
01:47:43,582 --> 01:47:45,447
I just know.

1225
01:47:45,651 --> 01:47:47,118
You're....

1226
01:47:51,156 --> 01:47:53,249
Are you staying long?

1227
01:47:53,459 --> 01:47:55,120
I have to go soon.

1228
01:47:57,996 --> 01:47:59,793
You've no time to write?

1229
01:47:59,998 --> 01:48:01,158
Not really.

1230
01:48:01,366 --> 01:48:02,390
Too bad.

1231
01:48:03,635 --> 01:48:05,125
I have your manuscript.

1232
01:48:05,337 --> 01:48:06,770
If you want, I could--

1233
01:48:07,539 --> 01:48:08,938
Don't turn round.

1234
01:48:19,384 --> 01:48:20,908
Sir! Just a second!

1235
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,052
Miss!
