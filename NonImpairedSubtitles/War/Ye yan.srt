1
00:01:00,627 --> 00:01:02,618
907 AD, China

2
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:06,698
the once mighty empire of the Tang Dynasty

3
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:10,061
has fallen into ruin

4
00:01:11,037 --> 00:01:13,005
Rebellion has spread across the land

5
00:01:13,139 --> 00:01:15,573
and its insurgents

6
00:01:16,176 --> 00:01:18,644
have proclaimed their own kingdoms

7
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:21,006
This is the period known as

8
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,779
the "Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms"

9
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:27,815
It was an era plagued by widespread turmoil

10
00:01:28,121 --> 00:01:30,919
treachery amongst government officials

11
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,025
and a bitter struggle for power

12
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:35,990
winthin the imperial family

13
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,723
Against this backdrop

14
00:01:37,897 --> 00:01:40,491
our story begins

15
00:01:42,735 --> 00:01:54,636
What blessed night is this?

16
00:01:55,348 --> 00:02:02,550
Drifting down the River Qian

17
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:19,897
What auspicious day is this?

18
00:02:21,407 --> 00:02:31,544
Dreaming beside my prince

19
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,809
A tender affection has blossomed between

20
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:37,385
the maiden Little Wan
and young Prince Wu Luan

21
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:40,287
but his father, the Emperor,
marries Little Wan himself

22
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:43,020
Desperate, Prince Wu Luan disappears

23
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:45,790
into the Southern heartlands

24
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:49,465
seeking solace in the art of music and dance

25
00:02:50,336 --> 00:02:51,701
Three years later

26
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:55,504
Prince Wu Luan's uncle has killed his brother,
the Emperor

27
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,974
and usurped the throne and the Empress

28
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,804
Empress Wan secretly sends her messengers

29
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:06,179
to warn Prince Wu Luan of the assassination
and urge his return

30
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:07,645
But she is unaware

31
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:11,550
the new Emperor has already
dispatched assassins

32
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,749
to prevent Prince Wu Luan's return

33
00:03:14,394 --> 00:03:32,643
Trees live on mountains
and branches live on trees

34
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:44,451
My heart lives for your heart

35
00:03:44,691 --> 00:03:49,628
but you do not see me...

36
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:50,920
From her Majesty the Empress

37
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,862
to Prince Wu Luan

38
00:03:58,271 --> 00:03:59,829
Our country has suffered a great loss

39
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,138
Your father, the Emperor, has passed away

40
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:05,239
Your uncle has usurped the throne

41
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:07,637
Return at once on receipt of this

42
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,817
Father...

43
00:07:43,095 --> 00:07:44,687
This helmet does not sit well on you

44
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,089
To call Your Emperor "you" is not appropriate

45
00:07:48,501 --> 00:07:49,991
The correct address is "Your Majesty"

46
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,808
It is hard for me to adapt so quickly

47
00:07:56,843 --> 00:07:58,208
Brother-in-law

48
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,453
Indeed this is not a good fit

49
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,221
I shall have a new one made

50
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:31,607
The kingdom shall not wait

51
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:50,257
Seal the door

52
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,786
Sister in law

53
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,159
The correct address is "Empress"

54
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,196
Your brother should not have trusted you

55
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,268
The death of the late Emperor

56
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:45,903
had nothing to do with me

57
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,139
Is the Crown Prince still alive?

58
00:10:56,122 --> 00:10:58,147
Sister in law seems very concerned

59
00:10:58,891 --> 00:11:00,586
I am his step mother after all

60
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,153
He is 4 years older than you are

61
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,461
Brother-in-law is familiar with the way I remove my make-up

62
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,070
Not just your make up

63
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,076
but also the way you enter your bath

64
00:11:33,926 --> 00:11:36,053
Will brother in law let the Prince go free?

65
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,897
Will you let my hand go free?

66
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:25,683
This theater is under
the Crown Prince's protection

67
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,653
Stay your swords now

68
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,417
Your servant Qing bows before Your Majesty

69
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,083
Your Majesty

70
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:51,958
Is this the red you had chosen?

71
00:18:53,232 --> 00:18:54,392
Hang it up

72
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,377
This material

73
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:10,310
was originally intended

74
00:19:10,482 --> 00:19:12,074
for your wedding to the Prince

75
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:16,747
However

76
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,615
it is now used in my coronation

77
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,625
Why did you run all the way here?

78
00:19:25,631 --> 00:19:27,656
When I was summoned to the inner court

79
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,061
I thought perhaps the Prince had returned

80
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,668
I was just about to ask you

81
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,799
Have you not heard from the Prince?

82
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,999
He never writes to me

83
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,512
Then how do you communicate?

84
00:19:42,214 --> 00:19:43,181
Through dreams

85
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:48,484
I dream of him every night

86
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:50,988
And we talk to each other

87
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:53,851
Did you dream of him last night?

88
00:19:54,826 --> 00:19:55,986
Yes

89
00:19:57,062 --> 00:19:58,723
What did he say to you?

90
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:01,394
He told me not to eat too much sweets

91
00:20:02,467 --> 00:20:04,059
But then he also said

92
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,965
young girls tend to like sweet things

93
00:20:06,171 --> 00:20:07,763
it is not really a bad habit

94
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:13,341
I also used to like sweet things

95
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,466
Brother in law really knows
how to please a woman

96
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,231
How do I compare with my brother?

97
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:21,310
The late Emperor was a wise and valiant man

98
00:21:22,581 --> 00:21:24,139
You mean to say

99
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:27,207
he was not very adept at pleasing you

100
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:28,643
No...

101
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,218
When he was willing

102
00:21:34,092 --> 00:21:36,925
he could be exceptionally virile

103
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,727
But he was not often willing

104
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:42,659
Am I right?

105
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,430
The tug between power and love

106
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:50,029
has tormented past emperors for centuries

107
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,881
You do not seem to be tormented

108
00:21:59,418 --> 00:22:02,683
Before tonight everything was simple

109
00:22:03,755 --> 00:22:07,555
I cared only for my kingdom

110
00:22:10,862 --> 00:22:15,765
But after tonight

111
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,001
when there is you, sister in law

112
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:28,738
what need do I have of a kingdom?

113
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,449
You certainly know how to flatter a woman

114
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:36,180
I speak from the heart

115
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:41,188
Why don't you give away the throne

116
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,992
so we can retire to the woods
and live like hermits?

117
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:47,999
What do you think?

118
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,600
Sister in law

119
00:22:52,437 --> 00:22:54,496
do you want me killed?

120
00:22:56,875 --> 00:23:00,868
I was only teasing

121
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,043
If it is my life that you want

122
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:06,284
you can have it

123
00:23:06,885 --> 00:23:09,217
You can have everything that is mine

124
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:14,915
Your Highness

125
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:18,584
My father...

126
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,822
How did he die?

127
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,622
They say that

128
00:24:23,829 --> 00:24:24,853
while he was taking his afternoon nap

129
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:28,464
he was stung by a scorpion

130
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:34,165
There are scorpions in the palace?

131
00:24:35,373 --> 00:24:37,671
They say you can find everything in the palace

132
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:41,609
Who are "they"?

133
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,044
The people who live there

134
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,382
Including her?

135
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,187
She is about to be crowned Empress again

136
00:24:53,024 --> 00:24:54,082
By whom?

137
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,027
Your uncle

138
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,491
the new Emperor

139
00:25:44,743 --> 00:25:45,539
Wu Luan

140
00:25:46,444 --> 00:25:47,308
Yes

141
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,738
You worried me to death

142
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:50,870
Empress Mother

143
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,915
You sound a little hoarse

144
00:26:03,361 --> 00:26:05,556
Why are you wearing such a strange mask

145
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:07,994
and a battered old sword case?

146
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:10,866
What has happened to you?

147
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:12,258
This is a question

148
00:26:13,204 --> 00:26:15,138
I should be asking you

149
00:26:19,344 --> 00:26:20,675
What have you heard?

150
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:24,039
Did I come back

151
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,146
to grieve for my father

152
00:26:28,219 --> 00:26:29,777
or to congratulate my step mother?

153
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:31,718
Do not use such a cruel tone of voice

154
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,618
against a helpless woman

155
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,559
I have sacrificed more than enough

156
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,962
for you and your father

157
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:39,893
But

158
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,120
my father's spirit

159
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,823
still wanders restlessly outside the palace gate

160
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,635
Empress Mother

161
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,312
Look into my eyes and tell me

162
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:06,950
Did my father

163
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:11,291
really die

164
00:27:11,596 --> 00:27:12,688
from the sting of a scorpion?

165
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,036
Wu Luan

166
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,237
The pain in your eyes

167
00:27:29,881 --> 00:27:32,042
breaks my heart

168
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,280
Don't ask so many questions

169
00:27:37,055 --> 00:27:39,046
Don't think too much

170
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:40,887
Promise me?

171
00:27:42,694 --> 00:27:44,958
The best way to soothe your father's spirit

172
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:47,858
is to make sure we are both safe

173
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,658
Especially you

174
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,334
Your Majesty

175
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:05,508
Forgive me

176
00:28:07,318 --> 00:28:09,377
My shabby clothes

177
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,452
have soiled the Empress' bathrobe

178
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:50,127
Show me what is inside your sword case

179
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,927
The sword of the Yue Maiden

180
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,431
best suited to close combat

181
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:48,017
I only use it for paper cutting now

182
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,947
When your father first taught us swordplay

183
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:25,946
you were always the better pupil

184
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:43,165
Is this your work?

185
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:46,171
These are the words of a song from Yue

186
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:49,580
Can you sing it for me?

187
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,339
It is about a Prince sailing down a stream

188
00:30:53,618 --> 00:30:55,586
and the rowing girl falls in love with him

189
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:57,888
She sings this song

190
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:00,982
So it is a love song

191
00:31:01,793 --> 00:31:02,725
No

192
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,692
it is a song about loneliness

193
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:07,565
You can sing to your young friend Qing

194
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,695
She would not understand

195
00:31:10,568 --> 00:31:12,365
No one can really understand another person

196
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:14,238
If we did

197
00:31:14,405 --> 00:31:15,463
we would not feel so lonely

198
00:31:18,643 --> 00:31:21,806
When your father allowed you
to pursue the arts

199
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,479
I was against the idea

200
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:27,081
To me, a man should not be

201
00:31:27,318 --> 00:31:28,683
a lonely musician

202
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,286
a product of warm hills and soft streams

203
00:31:32,457 --> 00:31:33,947
A proper man is a prince

204
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,560
who rules over his kingdom

205
00:31:37,762 --> 00:31:39,593
with strength and courage

206
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:43,828
That is only your idea of a man,
Empress Mother

207
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:45,332
But you have responsibilities

208
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,136
They're bestowed upon you
by the heavens above

209
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,136
passed on to you by your ancestors

210
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,940
expected of you by your people

211
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:03,777
Hasn't my uncle assumed
these responsibilities in me?

212
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:06,518
He...

213
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:23,167
His Majesty has commanded me
to greet you here

214
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,293
You have allowed the Prince to slip away

215
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,097
insulting His Majesty with your incompetence

216
00:33:29,707 --> 00:33:31,197
What do you suggest you should do?

217
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:40,207
We shall offer up our lives as penance

218
00:33:41,319 --> 00:33:42,877
Very good

219
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:46,356
Your families will be spared

220
00:33:47,825 --> 00:33:49,622
We thank his gracious Majesty for his lenience

221
00:34:51,889 --> 00:34:53,356
Clean the bridge

222
00:35:18,216 --> 00:35:20,184
This palace is falling to ruin

223
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:24,751
The late Emperor was a thrifty man

224
00:35:25,523 --> 00:35:27,889
but I am not going to suffer the way he did

225
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:29,988
Pave the ceiling

226
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:33,530
with flowers in gold leaf

227
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:36,030
Yes, Your Majesty

228
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:39,132
May I enquire

229
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,232
should the central pillar be painted in vermilion

230
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:44,939
or ink black?

231
00:35:47,311 --> 00:35:49,871
Vermilion is the color of blood

232
00:35:50,248 --> 00:35:52,716
and gold represents glory

233
00:35:53,117 --> 00:35:55,381
Which glorious dynasty

234
00:35:55,786 --> 00:35:58,050
has not been forged with blood?

235
00:35:58,756 --> 00:35:59,586
Minister Yin

236
00:35:59,757 --> 00:36:00,689
Your Majesty

237
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:02,652
I envy you

238
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:06,294
for having such a personable and astute son

239
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:08,830
gifted in both cultural and military affairs

240
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:11,732
Unlike my nephew

241
00:36:12,069 --> 00:36:14,264
your Crown Prince

242
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,268
who only knows to sing and dance

243
00:36:21,212 --> 00:36:23,874
If Your Majesty does not like
the snow leopard carving

244
00:36:24,148 --> 00:36:26,673
it can be replaced at once

245
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,719
I like it

246
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,455
When it snows

247
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:41,756
this creature stays inside
the cave to groom his fur

248
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:46,267
When the sun comes out,
it emerges shiny and sleek

249
00:36:47,738 --> 00:36:49,399
it knows about changing with the weather

250
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:52,308
This is a clever beast

251
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,944
May your servant suggest that

252
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:57,978
a tiger would be even more appropriate

253
00:36:58,482 --> 00:36:59,574
According to the Book of Change

254
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,081
a great man descends from a tiger

255
00:37:01,419 --> 00:37:02,647
a gentleman from a leopard

256
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:05,184
Your majesty is a great man

257
00:37:05,356 --> 00:37:07,722
The tiger has an appropriate air of majesty

258
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,222
Governor Pei Hong of You Province

259
00:37:11,262 --> 00:37:12,024
Your Majesty

260
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,595
Why are you silent?

261
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,397
I was thinking, perhaps

262
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:22,396
this snow leopard should be gifted
to Minister Yin

263
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:26,934
Why is that?

264
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,508
Because he too knows how to change
with the weather

265
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,657
Governor Pei's suggestion is excellent

266
00:37:45,129 --> 00:37:49,065
We shall bestow on Minister Yin
this beautiful carving

267
00:37:49,967 --> 00:37:51,366
My deepest gratitude to Your Majesty

268
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,499
As for a replacement...

269
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,900
let it be a tiger then

270
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,400
Better still, carve a flying dragon

271
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:12,387
Long live Your Majesty the Empress

272
00:38:16,093 --> 00:38:19,119
Your servant Pei Hong

273
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:22,164
bows before the Empress Dowager

274
00:38:40,518 --> 00:38:45,581
Governor Pei greeted the Empress
as Empress Dowager

275
00:38:47,091 --> 00:38:48,820
Did you all hear that?

276
00:38:50,261 --> 00:38:52,388
Yes

277
00:38:54,231 --> 00:38:55,459
What does this signify?

278
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,940
Nobody dares speak?

279
00:39:14,885 --> 00:39:15,874
Then let me explain

280
00:39:19,824 --> 00:39:21,655
The late Emperor has ascended
to the heavens

281
00:39:22,126 --> 00:39:24,686
if the Crown Prince succeeds the throne

282
00:39:25,396 --> 00:39:28,524
the Empress will become
the Empress Dowager

283
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,994
Thus, I am the usurper

284
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,901
Have we understood you correctly,
Governor Pei?

285
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:40,370
No wonder you are a respected scholar

286
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:46,311
With three words

287
00:39:46,951 --> 00:39:49,112
you have rearranged the hierarchy of the court

288
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:54,056
According to our ancestral customs

289
00:39:55,126 --> 00:40:00,996
the Emperor kneels to the Empress Dowager
as a son to his mother

290
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:09,601
But the Empress kneels to the Emperor
as a wife to her husband

291
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,848
Are you the Empress Dowager?

292
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:21,150
Or the Empress?

293
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,414
Should I kneel?

294
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:27,915
Or should you?

295
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,920
Please advise us

296
00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:33,922
Which is the correct procedure?

297
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:49,702
Your humble consort kneels
before Your Majesty

298
00:40:50,247 --> 00:40:52,238
Your Majesty

299
00:41:01,926 --> 00:41:03,416
Late Emperor

300
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,789
did your spirit in heaven

301
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,093
witness this vile exchange?

302
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:19,965
General Yin

303
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:23,411
Your Majesty

304
00:41:24,715 --> 00:41:27,445
The province of You is now yours to govern

305
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,245
I am your servant, Your Majesty

306
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:33,149
lmperial Guards

307
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:34,189
Your Majesty

308
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:37,792
Pei Hong is condemned to be beaten to death

309
00:41:38,095 --> 00:41:39,687
and his entire clan executed

310
00:41:39,964 --> 00:41:40,988
At once, Your Majesty

311
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:04,915
What was it that you said we should carve?

312
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:07,687
A flying dragon

313
00:42:08,492 --> 00:42:10,392
Let it be a dragon and a phoenix

314
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:44,585
This is too brutal

315
00:43:46,256 --> 00:43:48,053
They say that Pei Hong himself invented this
form of punishment

316
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:51,025
for the late Emperor's use

317
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,421
Pei Hong is dying because of me

318
00:44:00,671 --> 00:44:02,502
If you have any regrets

319
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,207
I can pardon him at once

320
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:08,545
No pardon

321
00:44:41,145 --> 00:44:43,113
I am grateful to you

322
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:45,507
You don't have to be

323
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,912
Did you help the late Emperor
in this same way?

324
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:50,776
No

325
00:44:51,588 --> 00:44:54,250
Then why are you being so generous with me?

326
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,595
You give me what the late Emperor
could never give

327
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,766
Lord Chamberlain

328
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:11,805
Present

329
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,771
I hereby proclaim

330
00:45:14,078 --> 00:45:16,103
the Empress coronation will take place

331
00:45:16,346 --> 00:45:19,509
on the fifteenth day of this month

332
00:45:25,089 --> 00:45:26,681
Your Majesty

333
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:30,592
the traitor Pei Hong is dead

334
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,668
He has returned

335
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:23,602
He is not a threat to you

336
00:46:25,182 --> 00:46:29,050
But you said that the people anticipate
his succession

337
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:54,608
Yin Sun

338
00:46:58,148 --> 00:46:59,706
What do you think you're doing?

339
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:04,117
This gift from the Emperor

340
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:06,518
is an insult to father

341
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,057
It may be an insult

342
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,521
but more than that, it is a test

343
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:12,721
If your father had not been able to withstand

344
00:47:12,896 --> 00:47:16,798
a little humiliation from time to time

345
00:47:17,267 --> 00:47:20,134
he would never have reached his present rank

346
00:47:20,304 --> 00:47:23,171
or been trusted by three successive emperors

347
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:29,311
What worries me is your little sister

348
00:47:29,546 --> 00:47:31,207
She is far too innocent

349
00:47:43,393 --> 00:47:46,021
I cannot get the eyes of the phoenix right

350
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:50,363
lmagine the eyes of Empress Wan

351
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,494
The Empress' eyes are

352
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:57,506
sometimes soft and charming

353
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,909
and sometimes frightening

354
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:02,067
A phoenix with a steady gaze

355
00:48:03,247 --> 00:48:06,114
is what would please the Empress most

356
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:10,411
The coronation is only two days away

357
00:48:10,854 --> 00:48:12,014
I fear this will not be ready in time

358
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:17,888
From now on

359
00:48:18,095 --> 00:48:19,653
it is best if you stopped seeing the Prince

360
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:23,998
Why?

361
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,397
When the late Emperor was alive

362
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:30,733
this match was our family's blessing

363
00:48:31,108 --> 00:48:32,507
Now that he is gone

364
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:35,976
I fear it may be our downfall

365
00:48:43,754 --> 00:48:45,051
My heart will never change

366
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:46,552
Make it change

367
00:48:47,024 --> 00:48:48,252
Learn from the Empress

368
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:58,866
Who cares about losing a kingdom

369
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:01,830
when in the presence of such rare beauty?

370
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:07,309
You can hardly be more secure on your throne

371
00:49:07,678 --> 00:49:09,509
I can't ruin you anyway

372
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:13,715
Qing, why don't you leave us

373
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:14,578
Yes, Your Majesty

374
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,892
In the heart of hearts, do you not trust me?

375
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,832
The person I do not trust is my dear nephew

376
00:49:40,043 --> 00:49:42,773
I wonder how his rehearsal
for the coronation is going

377
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:45,239
Your Majesty

378
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:46,346
this rehearsal

379
00:49:46,483 --> 00:49:47,313
adheres to the usual rules

380
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:48,643
only wooden swords are employed

381
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:51,349
Please examine the weapons, Your Highness

382
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,830
Thank you

383
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,001
We have heard that Your Highness
is an expert swordsman

384
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:14,276
Mere childish endeavours

385
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:15,869
I have not practiced in years

386
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,004
It is the Emperor's wish

387
00:50:18,215 --> 00:50:20,342
that our performance at the coronation

388
00:50:20,584 --> 00:50:21,949
should impress the entire court

389
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:24,551
Swordplay is always impressive

390
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:27,155
and performance is my specialty

391
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:31,953
In that case, please begin, Your Highness

392
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:49,389
I am dead

393
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:58,634
You really meant to kill him

394
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:00,227
We would not dare

395
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:14,447
He said he is dead

396
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:19,217
What does the Empress think he died of?

397
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,054
He...

398
00:54:22,892 --> 00:54:27,226
mistook a deadly combat for a show

399
00:54:31,034 --> 00:54:32,228
Precisely

400
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,571
And I thoroughly enjoyed the show

401
00:54:58,228 --> 00:55:00,389
How did you manage to lose so badly today?

402
00:55:01,898 --> 00:55:03,729
Did you think I lost?

403
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:07,330
I hope that you will do better

404
00:55:07,570 --> 00:55:08,798
at my coronation

405
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:14,704
Why do you wear a mask when you perform?

406
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:23,114
It transports an actor to the highest state
of his art

407
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,253
Without a mask

408
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:28,120
happiness, anger, sorrow and joy

409
00:55:28,358 --> 00:55:30,656
are simply written on his face

410
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:33,828
But with a mask

411
00:55:34,631 --> 00:55:40,399
a great artist can convey to the audience

412
00:55:41,037 --> 00:55:45,269
the most complex and hidden emotions

413
00:55:53,316 --> 00:55:57,514
In that case, what do you see
on my simple face?

414
00:56:00,724 --> 00:56:04,717
Six parts arrogance, three parts disquiet

415
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:08,990
and one part guilt towards your late husband

416
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:10,729
You are wrong

417
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:14,703
It is disappointment... disappointment in you

418
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:21,108
I no longer look to you to fulfill my dreams

419
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:25,246
I can only pray to the heavens to have mercy

420
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,642
and protect us both

421
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,448
You are incapable of even
the most basic play acting

422
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:39,761
Your sorrow, anger, bitterness and uncertainty

423
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:41,794
are there for all to see

424
00:56:41,965 --> 00:56:44,661
You permit danger to follow you everywhere

425
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:50,602
You think hiding behind a mask
can elevate your art?

426
00:56:52,475 --> 00:56:56,275
The highest level is to use your own face

427
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:57,741
and turn it into a mask

428
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:16,616
You are here

429
00:58:21,297 --> 00:58:22,161
Yes

430
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:26,863
This is what you asked for

431
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:33,804
Do not smell it

432
00:58:35,311 --> 00:58:36,903
The poison

433
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:40,777
is a thousand times deadlier than arsenic

434
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:42,711
If I can't smell it

435
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:45,179
how do I use it?

436
00:58:45,455 --> 00:58:48,356
You blow it into the ear with a quill

437
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:52,526
What is it made of?

438
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:54,794
Why is it so poisonous?

439
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,667
It's made of Erysipelas from the Northeast

440
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:05,136
ground together with

441
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:07,469
black scorpions of the Northwest

442
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:10,576
So nothing is more poisonous?

443
00:59:13,082 --> 00:59:14,174
No

444
00:59:14,651 --> 00:59:16,346
What can be more lethal than this?

445
00:59:18,688 --> 00:59:19,780
The human heart

446
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:26,652
There aren't any...

447
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:29,225
Any what?

448
00:59:30,633 --> 00:59:32,032
There aren't any scorpions in the palace

449
00:59:35,204 --> 00:59:37,399
I hear you brought back a song

450
00:59:42,845 --> 00:59:44,472
I heard it from the Empress...

451
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:14,834
Trees live on mountains
and branches live on trees

452
01:00:16,079 --> 01:00:21,346
My heart lives for your heart
but you do not see me

453
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,249
How pitiful...

454
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:25,681
Who?

455
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:29,083
The boat girl

456
01:00:31,294 --> 01:00:33,125
She loves him

457
01:00:35,565 --> 01:00:36,862
but he does not see her

458
01:00:41,504 --> 01:00:42,436
No

459
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:45,467
You are talking about me

460
01:00:46,743 --> 01:00:47,903
You think I'm pitiful

461
01:00:48,678 --> 01:00:50,236
She pities me too

462
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:53,173
Both of you

463
01:00:54,717 --> 01:00:56,742
use my suffering

464
01:00:57,687 --> 01:01:00,178
to lure me into your embrace

465
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,291
Is that not the case?

466
01:01:05,128 --> 01:01:05,924
No

467
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:07,153
Admit it

468
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,329
No

469
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:10,226
I am not her

470
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:11,355
You are her

471
01:01:11,768 --> 01:01:12,427
I am not her

472
01:01:12,602 --> 01:01:13,534
You are her

473
01:01:15,571 --> 01:01:16,538
I am not her

474
01:01:17,707 --> 01:01:18,901
You are her

475
01:02:12,495 --> 01:02:14,326
The coronation ceremony

476
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:17,232
of Her Majesty the Empress Wan

477
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:19,663
will now commence
