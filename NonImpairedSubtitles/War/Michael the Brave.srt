<i>Calugareni</i>

3
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,792
<i>For more than one hundred years,</i>

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,959
<i>Europe has trembled under</i>
<i>the attacks of the Ottoman armies.</i>

<i>1593.</i>

<i>Sultan Murad III urges</i>
<i>his troops to Vienna,</i>

7
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,471
<i>under Sinan Pasha's command,</i>

8
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,559

9
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,872
<i>As a miracle repeating over</i>
<i>and over along the centuries,</i>

10

<i>Wallachia, Transylvania</i>
<i>and Moldavia.</i>

12
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,958

15

MICHAEL THE BRAVE
THE BATTLE OF CALUGARENI

18
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,508
Eat, milords!

19
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:17,269
Feed yourselves!
I see you're weak!

20
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,231
Or maybe you don't enjoy
my lunch.

21
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,316
Of course we do!

22
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,597
- Is it good?
- Yes, it is!

23
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,831
Do you hear me, Pavel? This will
teach you to rise against me again!

24
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,795
Spike him!

25
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,272
- Eat! Don't you like it?
- Of course we do, Your Highness.

26
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,349
They're afraid of me. But it's
the only way, in these times.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:25,596
I am faithful to you, Selim Pasha.
Tell it to the mighty sultan!

28
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,793
I gave you two charriots
full of healthy children.

29
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,874
I know we don't have do it
anymore, but...

30
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:38,793
I'd give you two charriots of gold,

31
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:42,710
if you gave me
you know whose head.

32
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,398
What if he deserves more?

33
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,030
Voivode Alexandru
has forgiven you!

34
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,357
No. As I haven't forgiven him.

35
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:24,478
Michael, I was always your shadow.
I did what you wanted me to do.

36
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:29,471
Our home has turned to ashes.
We are hiding abroad.

37
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,558
The voivode has put a price
on your head. Where wil it end?

38
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,990
I'll go all the way, Stanca,
no matter where it may lead me.

39
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,269
Alexandru's men are after me.
I stopped just for a moment.

40
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,471
Where's Nicolae?

41
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,075
- I hid him.
- Where?

42
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,195
- I'll take him with me.
- No.

43
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,553
His life is in danger. Alexandru will
want revenge, if he sees I'm gone.

44
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,790
- No. You can't have him.
- I'm not used to this kind of words.

45
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,314
You should learn. You've taken
everything from me, Michael.

46
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,511
Even if you succeed,

47
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,717
you can't give me back
my serene and short happiness.

48
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:22,072
Don't worry! No one will touch
my son. Not even you.

49
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,756
Especially you.

50
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,353
As you have risen against him,

51
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,149
voivode Alexandru has ordered
your capture, general of Craiova!

52
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,679
Not inside the church.

53
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,033
I fear a trap.

54
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,470
You're handsome, but stupid,
Hassan.

55
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,154
Don't you understand?
I made a promise.

56
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,597
There's too much silence.

57
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,439
They, too, feel something
in the air.

58
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:15,072
Selim Pasha...

59
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,111
The Buzesti brothers...

60
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:29,833
You're right on time, Mihal.
How did you get away?

61
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,159
It was easy, Selim.

62
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:44,633
Radu... Father Stoica...
Brothers, let them pass this time!

63
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,958
Only this time.

64
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,995
But without the children!

65
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,397
Nobody move!

66
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:10,998
For the love of me,
let them pass with what they have!

67
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,509
These are children from our land.

68
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,159
Why, Michael?

69
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:20,477
Without his help,
I can't go to Istanbul.

70
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:26,115
I know him well enough to know
he never let his pray loose.

71
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:31,190
Selim is my childhood friend.
Please, let him pass!

72
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,432
Make way!
Let them pass!

73
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,354
Michael!

74
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,073
Mother...

75
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,431
You, too, have sold them your soul.
The son of voivode Patrascu...

76
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,993
You don't care about anything!
You want the throne at any cost!

77
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,671
You'd cover yourself in shame!
I damn you for all eternity!

78
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,314
You stand and watch your foe
mocking your people!

79
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,675
Don't curse me, mother!

80
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,793
The Prophet's teachings are great,
but I still don't understand.

81
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,838
Why do you need to rule
over such a wretched country?

82
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,954
I want to be the mightiest man
in this country.

83
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:58,796
Mihal, my friend...
Here, we are the mightiest of all.

84
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,036
Look at me!

85
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,274
Which one of you is stronger?

86
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,077
Does anyone dare fight him?

87
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,037
You! Come here!

88
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,793
Do you want this knife?

89
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:56,518
Yes, sir.

90
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:01,076
- You have to earn it.
- I will, sir!

91
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,156
Punch him!

92
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,272
Beat him!

93
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:21,480
Do as I tell you!

94
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,230
Do as I tell you!

95
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,398
Wait!

96
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:51,599
Now you beat him!

97
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,832
Enough!

98
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,113
Get up!

99
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,112
Kill him!

100
00:14:58,080 --> 00:15:01,197
These are my children, Mihal.

101
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,234
What's your name?

102
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,878
Hassan. Before, when I was ugly
and dirty, it was Ionica.

103
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:23,756
Now it's Hassan. You can kill me,
you're still an unfaithful to me.

104
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:41,395
You learned to contain yourself,
but not entirely.

105
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,434
Had I not loved you,
I would've had to kill you.

106
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,955
Maybe you'll be sorry
you didn't do it.

107
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:52,270
You haven't changed, Mihal.

108
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,919
- Selim, I want to ask you something.
- I'm listening.

109
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,316
Why did you join
Sinan Pasha's army?

110
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,715
Allah whispered to me that one day
I could become grand vizier.

111
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,480
You're dreaming, Selim.

112
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:25,957
Mihal, will your uncle lani
give you the money?

113
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,912
I don't know.

114
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:32,039
Two days ago, Alexandru offered me
two charriots of gold for your head,

115
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,919
and now I'm losing mine,
going along with you.

116
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,073
Allah didn't give me the brains
my mother would've wanted him to.

117
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,271
This one will make us rich.

118
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,949
If he's willing to pay this much,
how much money does he make?

119
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,196
Let him pay!
We'll settle later.

120
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:53,154
Mihal!
Alexandru's here.

121
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,320
Lani, give him
whatever he asks for!

122
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:04,149
Think again, Michali!
This is a great deal of money.

123
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:06,151
No. We'll pay what he asks.

124
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,393
Come on! Move!
Get out!

125
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:19,470
We need another 300000 coins.

126
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,832
I gave you my entire wealth.
I swear on my beard!

127
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,595
- I'll pay you back.
- Yes, but you know how it goes...

128
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:33,269
520000 coins in all. This means
543000, interest included.

129
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,598
- I told you it's not enough.
- Sign here!

130
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,596
I talked to Di Ventini, the richest
banker of the Genovese quarter.

131
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,633
- He's waiting for you.
- Di Ventini...

132
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:50,795
- You won't see a coin from him.
- Why, Selim? How do you know?

133
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,951
He won't pay even his respects.

134
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,715
I'm sorry, Signor Michele,
but I'm afraid I have to say no.

135
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:02,030
Rosana!

136
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,836
This is prince Michele.

137
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,997
If there is any other problem,
I am your humble servant.

138
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,469
Rosana, you entertain the prince!

139
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:19,553
My brother Carlo is the image
of our much praised impetuosity.

140
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,470
I am Rosana.

141
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,557
I'm curious... Could you tell me
the subject of your conversation?

142
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:30,713
I'm sure you heard everything,
<i>contessina.</i>

143
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,357
It's so exciting to see men
fight for their goals!

144
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,679
You then start to see their weak
points, their touching side.

145
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,471
You didn't plea for your cause
too well.

146
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:45,638
- I'm not used to asking.
- Then how will you get anything?

147
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:48,473
I've been living here for many years.
It's a strange world.

148
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,756
The shortest way is never
the right one.

149
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,435
A smile may bring death,
while a frowning, life.

150
00:18:55,240 --> 00:18:59,472
Let me ask you something!
How old are <i>you,contessina?</i>

151
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:04,593
Prince... Is the house of Di Ventini
your last option?

152
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,879
Yes.

153
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:11,230
- What if you don't get the money?
- I die.

154
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,392
You don't seem a man
of simple judgements.

155
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,594
<i>ContessinaRosana,</i>
have you ever thought

156
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:22,674
that there are men who wait
to watch the sun?

157
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,832
For them, this moment may never
come, but they still are trying.

158
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,358
What did the dame say?
She's the one who runs the business.

159
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,755
What did she say?
Tell me word for word!

160
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:39,557
- She said this was a strange world.
- Will she give you the money?

161
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:43,669
I don't know.
She didn't say anything.

162
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,957
- Is she beautiful?
- Why?

163
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,358
This means you've grown
older than me.

164
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:54,668
Mihal, think it over! We still may
leave tomorrow, alive and well.

165
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,678
My money...

166
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,709
<i>Ventini afendi...</i>

167
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,711
Please, come in, Your Excellency!

168
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,156
<i>Signorina contessa,</i>
I'm your humble servant.

169
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,868
My sister was so curious to see
your true oriental decorations,

170
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,194
that she convinced me
to take her with me.

171
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,837
Today I tried to look at the sun.
It's hard.

172
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:41,348
- My eyes were full of tears.
- Thank <i>you,contessina.</i>

173
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:50,079
<i>Signor principe,our</i> house
thanks you for your demand.

174
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,993
Our mild doubts had nothing to do
with you.

175
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,639
I tossed and turned in my bed
all night long.

176
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,234
If Alexandru pays Sinan Pasha
a greater sum,

177
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:05,153
it's your head the sultan
will cut off, dear nephew!

178
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,479
Look at him, pig!
Woe to us!

179
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:17,553
Sinan Pasha agreed to take
your money. He wants to see you.

180
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,235
You should barely speak.
He's wreckless and moody.

181
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,678
You mizerable sod!

182
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:30,476
Is this him?

183
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:37,150
Young man, where do you think
you are? At the Court of Rome?

184
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:42,031
Before the mighty sultan, you bow
to the ground and kiss his slipper.

185
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,551
Let me see you!

186
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,995
Right... That's it.
Rise!

187
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:59,870
You made a good first impression.
I heard good things about you.

188
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,357
You walk in fear of God,
you are rich...

189
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,716
I heard very bad things
about your rival Alexandru.

190
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:12,799
We learned some proof about
his betrayal to the great sultan.

191
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:16,191
But... you may not be to his liking,
either.

192
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:20,274
Your Highness, we did everything
to please the almighty sultan.

193
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,036
Did anyone ask you anything?
Let's go!

194
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:41,717
We don't know what the thoughts
of this man are,

195
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:45,999
while Alexandru has always
submitted to us.

196
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,191
There's Alexandru!

197
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,757
Dear Christ...
Help us, Virgin Mary!

198
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,239
Only Allah can help you here.

199
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:15,318
Have mercy on me, almighty!

200
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:26,672
Have mercy, great sultan!

201
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,556
The hearing's over.

202
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:53,678
Wait! Stay a little longer!

203
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:57,797
Leave us alone!

204
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,632
Come with me!

205
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:25,476
I like you. Here, all you see
is crawling backs,

206
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:29,633
even those who have the hoofs of
their horses full of Europe's dust.

207
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:32,314
But I could've not liked you.

208
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,117
How could you dare?

209
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,398
We only have one life,
almighty sultan!

210
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,280
Right... Too bad!

211
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:59,715
Master! Have mercy on me!
Almighty sultan!

212
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,391
Murad! You'll be sorry!

213
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:13,271
You'll be sorry
to have chosen him!

214
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,033
Mihal bey,

215
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:33,033
what do you think is Allah's
most precious gift to man?

216
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,191
- Life.
- You couldn't have said otherwise.

217
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,751
You're too insignificant.

218
00:27:46,040 --> 00:27:48,395
You'll be reigning over a small land.

219
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:53,032
One day, your lords will bribe
my men, as you did,

220
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,159
and I will give the order.

221
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,238
Man's greatest gift is power,
Mihal.

222
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:08,553
The most precious one
and the most tiresome.

223
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,872
- Listen!
- I'm listening, almighty one.

224
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,949
When you leave, you'll be a poor
prince of some small country.

225
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,517
Your neighbours will humiliate you,
you'll fear us... Stay here!

226
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,788
When young,
Sinan was a Christian, too.

227
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,515
I'll give you an army and then
you'll know what power is.

228
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,599
What do you say?

229
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:34,355
I'm not an army man
and I don't want to disappoint you.

230
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:37,672
- I care too much for my head.
- Too bad!

231
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:42,630
Allah will sometimes put
petty souls into strong bodies.

232
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:45,831
Why?

233
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,310
- What was Alexandru shouting?
- That you'll be sorry you chose me.

234
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:54,029
You don't care too much
for your head.

235
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,678
Indeed, I may be sorry one day
that I chose you.

236
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,390
Why don't you get in, your Highness?
Everybody wants to meet you.

237
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:25,869
I came here to thank you.
I must leave.

238
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,757
- I'm sorry.
- Why did you help me?

239
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,955
You're not like the people
that usually ask us for money.

240
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,439
I was impressed to see
that you didn't know how to beg.

241
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,395
- Do you know where my country is?
- Now I do. East of Transylvania.

242
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,199
I'll be travelling there soon,
at Alba lulia.

243
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,356
A friend of mine,
Christina von Habsburg,

244
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,915
is getting married
to prince Sigismund.

245
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,718
I'll be close to your country

246
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,997
and, normally, I want to know
what happens to my money.

247
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:59,432
I'm talking nonsense. I'd very much
like to know your country.

248
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,197
<i>Bucharest</i> - <i>December 1594</i>

249
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:09,716
- We've been robbed!
- Give us our money!

250
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,470
They locked the gates!

251
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,598
They robbed us!
They must pay their debt!

252
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,228
Why are you laughing?

253
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,029
I barely saw my father. We've been
hiding, he was on the road...

254
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:33,993
I don't even know if I can recognize
him, dressed like a prince.

255
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,952
He got to the throne
with our money!

256
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,639
Pay your debts!

257
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:42,472
Give us our money!
You robbed us, you thieves!

258
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:48,552
Give us our money, you thieves!

259
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:53,997
Let him come outside
and pay his debt!

260
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:56,632
Be courageous!

261
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:09,394
I'm glad I find you in good health,
Your Highness.

262
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,233
What kind of a ruler is he?
He never pays his debts!

263
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,153
- He's hiding!
- Michael, what's going on?

264
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:16,869
Nothing.

265
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:19,116
Who are these men?
Why are they shouting?

266
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:20,719
You're imagining things,
Stanca.

267
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,558
- Nicolae!
- Preda!

268
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:26,030
- I'm so glad to see you!
- Nicolae!

269
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,554
Welcome! Come with me!

270
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,312
Preda...

271
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,476
Present our son
to the Lords' Council!

272
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:48,878
Wait!
You don't need these trinkles.

273
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:53,589
Don't you have anything
to say to me?

274
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:59,075
I missed you, Stanca.
I waited for your arrival.

275
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,518
Thank you, especially because
it's not true.

276
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:11,193
You put your life at risk
for this throne, Michael.

277
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,313
Was it worth...

278
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:18,557
Milady, your rooms are ready.

279
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:36,312
- Radu!
- Enough! Silence! Stop whining!

280
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:43,034
I want to know if you give me
the money or not.

281
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,674
We've already done it once.
We're wondering...

282
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,877
What, Filimon? Do you or don't you
have money for the Turks?

283
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:51,110
What about the gold coins
I gave you?

284
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:53,316
You're buying weapons,
but never pay the tribute.

285
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,555
Who spoke?

286
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,513
I am too dumb to speak,
but, if we can, we'll pray...

287
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:00,558
Pray in church, milord,
for forgiveness!

288
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:03,513
The Turks don't forget
about their tribuite.

289
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,190
We're a cursed country,
Your Highness. We're poor.

290
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:13,995
- What did you decide?
- We're with you, Your Highness.

291
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,152
Stand straight, Nicolae!

292
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,838
What do you say?

293
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:26,355
Buzesti! Selim bey is free to enter
wherever he wants.

294
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,354
He should see how faithful we are
to the great sultan.

295
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:33,075
Faithful? You haven't paid
the legal tribute for six months.

296
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:36,078
The soldiers who guard your throne
didn't receive their pay.

297
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,748
Sinan Pasha is upset.
This is why I'm here.

298
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,912
The country is poor, Selim bey.

299
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,509
Didn't you know it
when you asked to be prince?

300
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:46,512
Stroe!

301
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,118
Selim Pasha...

302
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,078
Even though some lords
don't want to pay anything,

303
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:57,072
all the debts of my country
will be paid today.

304
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:01,115
We have gathered the money
in the house of the brothers Buzesti.

305
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:06,278
I want to please everybody.
Announce the crowd!

306
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:13,434
- You came a long way, Selim.
- A very long way, Mihal.

307
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:25,713
Is it ready?

308
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:30,071
Yes. Do come in!
We'll pay for everything!

309
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,391
Thank you.

310
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:36,313
- He lives in fear of the Turks.
- You said it!

311
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,955
If it weren't for them...

312
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:54,430
I was ordered to speak to you
like this and this is what I did.

313
00:34:54,680 --> 00:34:58,559
You can kill me, Mihal, but I don't
know why you wanted to rule here.

314
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,470
I know what you're worth.
Earlier, I was talking to the prince,

315
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,353
not to my friend.

316
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,949
I know, Selim.
I thank you for this.

317
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:38,112
Stroe!

318
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,433
To the charriots!

319
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:39,635
Mihal!

320
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:45,836
I liked it!
Now I recognize you!

321
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,158
Like in the old days!

322
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,479
Jump, Selim!

323
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:23,676
Selim, take your horse, go to Sinan
and tell him what you saw!

324
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,551
You are free. You talked to me in two
different ways. I answered the same.

325
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:42,798
What is it, Radu?

326
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:48,554
It's the house we were born in,
Your Highness. But we are glad.

327
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:52,278
Don't worry!
It was old, anyway.

328
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:57,871
Long live the prince!

329
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:21,828
Forgive me, son,
for not trusting you.

330
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:25,078
- I'm sorry.
- What did you think, mother?

331
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:28,756
Is this what you think of me?
That I can sell my country?

332
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:34,596
And you? What did you think?
That I, voivode Michael,

333
00:38:34,760 --> 00:38:37,672
would drink this cup of shame
to the last drop?

334
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:44,389
From this day on, I free myself
in front of God and you

335
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,234
of any debt and submission!

336
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:52,315
And I will free all those
who are with me!

337
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:55,713
We have our life and our honour!

338
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:59,397
Wake up! We've been sleeping
too long!

339
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:18,433
The existence of a wall between us
and the Ottoman Empire is mandatory.

340
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:22,758
The territory of the 3 principalities
must come to our attention.

341
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:26,193
As we appreciate
the determination and noble courage

342
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:29,756
of Sigismund Bathory,
prince of Transylvania,

343
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:37,030
who cast away the Ottoman rule
and became our precious vassal,

344
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:41,633
we chose our nephew, archduchess
Maria Christina de Gratz,

345
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,996
to be the valliant prince's wife.

346
00:39:44,280 --> 00:39:45,998
Calm down, Sigismund!

347
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,233
This marriage is to show the world
we want to make the prince...

348
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:54,032
My dear cousin, if my adhesion
to the Christian cause

349
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:57,312
forces me to suffer the martyrdom
of this marriage...

350
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,548
General Basta will ensure with our
troops Transylvania's independence.

351
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,110
Will the general explain his strategy
for the other two principalities:

352
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:11,238
Wallachia and Moldavia.
<i>Herr general...</i>

353
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,836
Your Majesty...

354
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,351
Gentlemen...

355
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,913
I'm happy.

356
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:21,032
I've always dreamt of becoming
a humble protector of the cross,

357
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:24,550
of giving my life in revenge
of the sacred wounds of our Saviour.

358
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,829
This day...

359
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,838
Dear Boris, the fate of our coalition
is sealed.

360
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:32,715
The fate of the two neighbouring
countries is of great concern to me.

361
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:35,639
Here are the messengers
of prince Aron of Moldavia,

362
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:38,997
who announced that they accepted
to be vassals of Transylvania.

363
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,919
You'll make friends with the devil,
to meet your goal.

364
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:44,873
I will properly settle things
with Wallachia.

365
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,316
This young man walks
on my nerves.

366
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:57,278
Prince Sigismund, don't forget
Wallachia is under Turkish rule.

367
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:03,277
Does Your Majesty think Murad
would invade Wallachia?

368
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,955
In his place, wouldn't we do
the same?

369
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,474
What do you know
about the new prince...

370
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,956
...Michael Patrascu?

371
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:16,038
He's a most unreliable character,
Your Majesty.

372
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:19,477
With money and shrewdness,
he bought the throne from Sinan,

373
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:21,716
whom he seems
to be friends with.

374
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,869
He has recently paid his creditors
by setting them on fire, like boars.

375
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:32,389
What can we think of a man who meets
his commitments in such a manner?

376
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,237
He's an adventurer.

377
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:40,235
He wants to gather money and leave
for a quiet corner of Europe.

378
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:44,674
Your Eminency, we are glad
you are so well informed.

379
00:41:45,360 --> 00:41:48,158
What other details do you know,
general Basta?

380
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:51,955
Your Majesty, as a tactician,
I'm interested in two things:

381
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,273
Our enemy and our ally.

382
00:41:55,920 --> 00:42:01,074
I understand prince Sigismund wants
Wallachia to be our battle ground.

383
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,870
We must protect the dwellings
of the civilized world, Your Majesty.

384
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,397
Wallachia is a country only by name.
It has no master.

385
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,514
<i>Braila</i>

386
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,478
<i>Cernavoda and Zimnicea</i>

387
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:13,799
<i>Nicopole and Vidin</i>

388
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:19,917
Get up, Preda!
There's more 'till Istanbul.

389
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:31,471
Down with your weapons!

390
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,755
<i>Rusciuk</i>

391
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,992
On your knees!

392
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,190
- Preda!
- I'm here, milord!

393
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:26,708
- Preda, do you remember your Latin?
- Yes. I learned it in Padua.

394
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:28,873
Let me hear you!

395
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:36,077
Good... Tonight you will prepare
for a long journey.

396
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:39,278
- Milord... Now, when...
- Preda Buzescu!

397
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,951
Tonight you're leaving for Rome.

398
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,915
Your deeds are worthy
of your Roman ancestors.

399
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,911
Tell the valliant prince Michael

400
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,916
that he is not facing alone
this pagan Goliath.

401
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,635
Can we then count on the help
of the Holy Roman Church?

402
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:11,111
The Romans were famed
for their practicality.

403
00:45:11,400 --> 00:45:14,995
I'm glad to see this virtue
has not wasted away.

404
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,597
Tell prince Michael

405
00:45:18,080 --> 00:45:22,596
that the Holy Roman Church
will support his actions

406
00:45:22,840 --> 00:45:27,709
not only through its warm prayers,
but with all its financial might.

407
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,438
How can I interpret these precious
words, Holy Father?

408
00:45:32,160 --> 00:45:35,357
I see why you're saying this.

409
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,639
The army of Rudolph of Austria
will join you at the soonest.

410
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,590
<i>In nomine Patris et Filii</i>
<i>et Spiritus Sancti, amen.</i>

411
00:45:53,240 --> 00:45:57,677
As for us, my son...
Big words, but petty interests!

412
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:02,159
I can assure the Holy Father
that I'm in great difficulty.

413
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:07,637
I could bearly soothe the pure
passion of prince Sigismund.

414
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:13,189
- But general Basta's ambitions...
- Plots and childish pride!

415
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:15,353
You've been everywhere,

416
00:46:15,560 --> 00:46:18,279
but you never said a word
about this Wallachian prince.

417
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:24,669
Your Holiness, all our reports
saw him as faithful to the Turks.

418
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,675
He seemed unreliable.

419
00:46:27,840 --> 00:46:31,833
This unreliable man makes his way
to Istanbul by sword, Your Eminence.

420
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:37,555
You will go His Majesty king Rudolph
and you will see that Basta's army

421
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:40,998
leaves right now to the help
of prince Michael.

422
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,838
<i>Benedico te.</i>

423
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:27,231
Charge!

424
00:47:28,840 --> 00:47:33,277
<i>Stanesti and Serpatesti</i>

425
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,676
<i>Giurgiu</i>

426
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,670
<i>Razgrad</i>

427
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:10,796
<i>Varna</i>

428
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:16,036
<i>Adrianopolis</i>

429
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:54,513
What is this?

430
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,872
- Selim Pasha's coming.
- Selim Pasha? How dare he?

431
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,874
How can you have the courage
to come to my face?

432
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:36,794
You bastard! You had the nerve
to tell me you knew him.

433
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,755
- Didn't you ever suspect anything?
- No.

434
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,391
Then, you're a fool.

435
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,470
- What do you think he'll do?
- He's cunning and swift.

436
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:52,076
He'll fight us until the end.
If he gets help...

437
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:55,835
He will conquer Istanbul,
before I get the chance to be there.

438
00:49:56,040 --> 00:49:59,828
And I wander through these sands...
It's only your fault!

439
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:05,188
Who sent you here?

440
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:08,119
The almighty sultan is waiting
for you in Istanbul, the soonest.

441
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,872
What about you?

442
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,439
The great sultan made me head
of the armies that fight in Persia.

443
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,472
Charge!

444
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:27,708
Go get them, brothers!

445
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,715
My God, father...
So much water!

446
00:52:08,120 --> 00:52:09,951
It's salty!

447
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,432
<i>Prague, 1595</i>

448
00:52:29,360 --> 00:52:34,036
It was just the right moment.
Sinan was busy fighting in Persia.

449
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:38,113
The Wallachians' attack
took the Turks by surprise.

450
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:42,910
General, you explain everything
in such a crude manner! Funny...

451
00:52:43,120 --> 00:52:46,317
Didn't you invite this prince
to the Council's round table?

452
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:49,120
I, for one, cannot trust him.

453
00:52:51,120 --> 00:52:53,998
His victories are
the result of hazard.

454
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:58,552
- Your Eminency, what do you think?
- The Lord works in mysterious ways.

455
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,516
Indeed. This unreliable man who
used to pay tribute to the Turks

456
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,280
has amazed the entire Europe.
We must help him.

457
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:09,080
Allow me to take leave,
Your Majesty.

458
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:13,792
A brilliant tactician
with the pride of a child!

459
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:17,598
The mere idea of another's success
makes him hate him,

460
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,677
even if he doesn't know him.

461
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,550
What is the Holy Father's advice
to me?

462
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:30,158
Your Majesty, this time I bring you
the gold promised to the Holy League,

463
00:53:30,360 --> 00:53:32,669
to gather an army
against the pagans.

464
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,716
You should've told me this great news
at the beginning of our hearing.

465
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,792
I must confess this is
a most pleasant surprise.

466
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,879
I'm happy I can be of some use
to you, Your Majesty.

467
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:47,676
- Still, I'm worried.
- I'm listening, Your Eminency.

468
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,111
Do you think we can trust
this stranger with the gold

469
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:55,353
that the Holy Roman Church wishes
to donate to the Crusade?

470
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:59,829
I was thinking that prince Sigismund
was the most...

471
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:03,397
Don't get me wrong!
I won't have it.

472
00:54:03,760 --> 00:54:08,595
I'm not that mad as to give the much
awaited money to the first comer.

473
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:14,917
We will organize an army.
You will go meet prince Michael.

474
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:17,993
You will crawl inside his soul,
a primitive one, I suppose,

475
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:21,272
and you will give us details
and then we will decide.

476
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:45,716
I'm anxious to see prince Michael
among so many heroes!

477
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:50,755
I have the feeling I see scenes
from the Iliad.

478
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:06,118
Your Highness... Our Holy Father
sends you this cross,

479
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:09,914
as a sign of that which
you are fighting for.

480
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,996
When will the army arrive?

481
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,750
Preparations are almost ready.

482
00:55:15,240 --> 00:55:19,791
The Holy Father and Emperor Rudolph
decided to give you all the support

483
00:55:20,040 --> 00:55:21,632
you asked for.

484
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:26,436
The great general Basta will join
swords with your invincible army.

485
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,113
When?

486
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,677
- In five months.
- Five months?

487
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:40,235
You're too great a tactician, not to
see that such an attack takes time.

488
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,595
Look over there, Your Eminency!

489
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:54,317
And there. Do you know what these
warriors expect? To raise my arm

490
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:58,149
and tell them that 10,000 mighty
soldiers came to their help.

491
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:02,194
Then, they would howl for joy and
bring down the walls of Istanbul!

492
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:06,196
With or without Basta,
I would have been there in a week.

493
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:09,116
- Preda!
- Yes, milord!

494
00:56:09,320 --> 00:56:11,754
Call the men!
We're going home.

495
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:14,118
How, milord?

496
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:17,352
If I hear another word,
I'll cut your head off!

497
00:56:43,160 --> 00:56:47,039
Your Eminency, maybe I was wrong
to ask for help in Rome.

498
00:56:47,440 --> 00:56:49,715
You're the cousin
of prince Sigismund.

499
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:53,549
Do you think he would agree to help
me keep the Turks to the Danube,

500
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,796
until the Christian army
gathers up?

501
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:00,312
You were right to think about your
Transylvanian brother.

502
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:06,756
You'd better ask him personally.
I will bless the friendship

503
00:57:07,320 --> 00:57:11,677
between two princes reigning
over two neighbouring countries.

504
00:57:12,320 --> 00:57:14,197
Then, we'll leave together.

505
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:33,879
The noble count Gaspar Cornis,
great champion of the Hussars,

506
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,949
is honoured to fight against
the prince of Transylvania,

507
00:57:38,200 --> 00:57:42,193
count of the Székely people and ruler
over part of the Hungarian country,

508
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:44,078
Sigismund of Bathory!

509
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:45,753
I dedicate my battle

510
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:49,231
to the noble lady, the archduchess
Maria Christina of Austria,

511
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:53,638
my beloved fiancée, whom I think
of as most beautiful and pure,

512
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:55,990
and I will fight to prove it.

513
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,718
I hope that, after our wedding,

514
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,519
the prince will find a better way
to waste his energy.

515
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:11,638
- Do you love him?
- He's nice, but he's childish.

516
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:15,469
You talk to your prince! He's awful.
Do you think he can speak?

517
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:16,869
Anyway, he knew.

518
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:21,672
Your Highness, today it's sunny,
the colours are shining...

519
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,034
Won't you smile?

520
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:25,634
You're right.
I was deep in my thoughts.

521
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:28,268
Forgive me!
I didn't want to upset you.

522
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:31,597
I don't have this right, Rosana.
I owe you money.

523
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:35,277
Had we been to Bucharest,
would you have set me on fire?

524
00:58:35,840 --> 00:58:40,038
- What kind of a man is Sigismund?
- He's the way you see him.

525
00:59:06,520 --> 00:59:09,193
Had I taken him out with a pole,
he wouldn't have stood up.

526
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:22,872
Applaud!

527
00:59:24,360 --> 00:59:26,396
Michael of Wallachia!

528
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:30,155
I'd like us to start our friendship
with a chivalrous contest!

529
00:59:30,920 --> 00:59:33,434
Don't say yes!
For Christ's sake!

530
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:39,953
My dear friend, we are not here
to fight and have fun.

531
00:59:48,120 --> 00:59:52,352
Your Highness, fighting with
the lance is a knight's pride.

532
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:56,512
I thank you for making me
this honour, Sigismund.

533
00:59:56,720 --> 00:59:57,869
Don't, Michael!

534
00:59:58,080 --> 01:00:01,356
Prince Sigismund of Bathory,
never beaten!

535
01:00:01,640 --> 01:00:04,632
He will face prince
Michael of Wallachia!

536
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:08,628
- Dear God, help him!
- Who's he?

537
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,273
Voivode Michael,
the one who beats the Turks.

538
01:00:19,080 --> 01:00:22,197
You can't compete without a helmet!
It's against the rules!

539
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:27,398
Let's hope God will teach him
a lesson. It'd be best for everyone.

540
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,429
You can't do it!
It's against the rules!

541
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,150
Go on!

542
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,552
He asked for it.

543
01:00:45,360 --> 01:00:48,397
Rosana Di Ventini,
you never told me anything!

544
01:02:01,320 --> 01:02:03,515
Are you all right?
Anything broken?

545
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,428
No. I'm fine.

546
01:02:13,320 --> 01:02:16,039
You're crazy. Don't you know
he did it for you?

547
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:24,870
- My God! You shook him hard!
- He bit the dust! He asked for it.

548
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:33,918
Your Highness, no matter
how much my pride has to suffer,

549
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,036
I'm honoured to shake your hand.

550
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,473
- You deserved this victory.
- It was an accident.

551
01:02:39,640 --> 01:02:43,758
No! Please! You proved to be
a fine handler of the lance.

552
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:49,154
Milord... We don't have time to fight
between us, but with the Turks.

553
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:53,715
And another thing:
They are excellent lancers.

554
01:02:55,920 --> 01:03:00,198
A very subtle politician... Brave
as Achilles and shrewd as Ullyses!

555
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:06,310
I get it, although my cousin
the cardinal says I miss subtleties.

556
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:11,959
You know what?
Let's have our talk right here!

557
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:26,396
It's nice here.
It smells like horses.

558
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:35,394
And strong men. I feel I'm your
friend now. Let me speak as such!

559
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:42,080
I studied your proposals
and I agree to them.

560
01:03:43,080 --> 01:03:48,757
May God be with us! Sigismund, I'll
tell you something you don't know.

561
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,875
The Turks can be defeated.

562
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:58,037
My dear friend... Always the same!
Right to the point.

563
01:03:59,960 --> 01:04:03,509
I want to ask you...
Can you beat them all by yourself?

564
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,635
No. That's why I'm here.

565
01:04:07,240 --> 01:04:10,755
I wouldn't want to offend you.

566
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:14,672
But, for those who can help you,
what are you?

567
01:04:16,640 --> 01:04:19,552
- I'm myself.
- No, my dear friend.

568
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:23,397
I'll tell you once again,
even if we had to fight again.

569
01:04:25,760 --> 01:04:30,754
You're nothing. Most of the people
never heard of your country.

570
01:04:32,320 --> 01:04:34,834
I know you could kill me
for these words.

571
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:38,034
What are your relations
to the European courts?

572
01:04:38,240 --> 01:04:41,232
To count on Rudolph's help,
I, Sigismund of Bathory,

573
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:46,912
have to marry his niece! Compared
to her, Lucrezia Borgia's a saint!

574
01:04:48,960 --> 01:04:52,032
- How many men do you have?
- All the men in the country.

575
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,431
Please...
Let's forget about these big words!

576
01:04:56,080 --> 01:04:58,753
I know you're in pain.
You're proud.

577
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,394
Have you ever received any help,

578
01:05:02,560 --> 01:05:05,279
except for the cross that my cousin
asked me to send you?

579
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,317
So, it was from you.

580
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:11,559
We were all wondering who this
Michael was and how he was like.

581
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:15,878
Was he a man
or was he half bear?

582
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,755
The king of Spain
doesn't know his own empire,

583
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,751
and you want him to know you?

584
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:25,029
Face the reality! Your actions must
be supported by a name

585
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:28,038
that is a guarantee
for all European kings!

586
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:32,119
- That is, your name, Sigismund.
- Right.

587
01:05:33,880 --> 01:05:35,791
To the entire Christian world,

588
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:38,309
the house of Bathory
and that of Habsburg

589
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:40,795
are your only guarantee.

590
01:05:41,480 --> 01:05:45,519
But, if your pride goes before
the interest of your country...

591
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:54,230
Think it over!

592
01:06:35,000 --> 01:06:39,039
Together with the entire transalpine
Wallachia, with all its virtues,

593
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:42,597
and under the merciful
and deep protection

594
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:46,833
of the most praised prince
of Transylvania, Sigismund Bathory,

595
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:52,990
we, voivode ruling over this country,
receive his gracious protection.

596
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:12,198
Our common purpose is to fight
against the wretched Crescent.

597
01:07:14,120 --> 01:07:16,156
May God help us!

598
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:18,552
Amen.

599
01:07:18,800 --> 01:07:23,476
Here signs, God willing, the prince
of the Sacred Roman Empire,

600
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:27,869
of Transylvania, Moldavia
and transalpine Wallachia,

601
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:32,198
count of the Szekely people
and ruler of part of Hungaria,

602
01:07:32,360 --> 01:07:34,271
Sigismund Bathory.

603
01:07:46,440 --> 01:07:49,750
Here signs our representative
Michael Patrascu,

604
01:07:50,040 --> 01:07:52,270
our beloved faithful ally.

605
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:19,911
What was worse is over. Now you
can count on our full support.

606
01:08:26,840 --> 01:08:29,673
Gentlemen...
Let's celebrate!

607
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:55,510
With all these ceremonies, I didn't
get the chance to congratulate you

608
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:59,719
for your many victories.
If I ever get the chance,

609
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:03,431
I will be happy to give you
the command of my cavalry.

610
01:09:04,480 --> 01:09:06,232
Go to hell!

611
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,319
I wouldn't have believed it
possible...

612
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:13,797
All my hopes were
with His Highness Michael...

613
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:16,753
I was hoping he'd remember
us Romanians here,

614
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:19,998
for we are under fierce oppression,
milords...

615
01:09:20,200 --> 01:09:22,156
Shut up, man!

616
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,876
I was afraid you'd left.

617
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,036
You're so sad, Michael.

618
01:10:17,320 --> 01:10:20,198
May God have mercy on him,
if he doesn't keep his word!

619
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:25,071
I will be the end of him.
He'll curse the hour he met me.

620
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,556
What about you, Rosana?

621
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,554
I've been waiting so much
to see you!

622
01:10:33,400 --> 01:10:36,756
I imagined our meeting
in a hundred ways.

623
01:10:37,360 --> 01:10:38,679
I must tell you...

624
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:49,120
Will we ever see each other
again?

625
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:53,869
If you stay here, yes.

626
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,795
I want to speak to Selim Pasha!

627
01:11:36,160 --> 01:11:38,469
What's the name of the river
in front of us?

628
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:40,791
Romanians call it Neajlov.

629
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:43,116
How many men and cannons
do they have?

630
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:46,238
About 16,000 men
and 20 cannons.

631
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:52,351
Tell me, Selim Pasha... Did you think
I'd fight the Wallachian,

632
01:11:52,560 --> 01:11:54,630
while you played the hero
in Persia?

633
01:11:55,880 --> 01:11:58,713
Yes, Sinan Pasha.
That's what I thought.

634
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,068
Do you remember you brought him to
the Court, to take over his throne?

635
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:07,156
It's been a long time,
but I remember.

636
01:12:07,480 --> 01:12:09,948
Tomorrow you will wash away
this shame.

637
01:12:11,440 --> 01:12:13,351
Allah be with us!

638
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:19,277
What's this noise?

639
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:26,113
Mosquitos. We're in swamp land,
Your Grace.

640
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,711
Milord...

641
01:12:43,760 --> 01:12:45,512
I want to ask you something.

642
01:12:46,280 --> 01:12:48,077
Do you want me to make you
a metropolitan?

643
01:12:48,280 --> 01:12:50,840
No. I want to stay with the army.

644
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:54,879
I don't want you to regret one day
that we joined our fate, father.

645
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:58,869
- The Lord is stronger and wiser.
- Maybe, but this is what I want.

646
01:12:59,240 --> 01:13:01,549
Father, guess who's here!

647
01:13:06,280 --> 01:13:07,633
Stanca... You, here?

648
01:13:08,040 --> 01:13:11,715
I brought you another 300 horsemen
from Oltenia. I knew you'd need them.

649
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:14,917
You're so brave, Stanca!
As always.

650
01:13:15,200 --> 01:13:18,556
Nicolae, my son, go to sleep!
We have a hard day tomorrow.

651
01:13:29,080 --> 01:13:31,958
- You look worried.
- No... I'm just sad.

652
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,276
They let me down again.

653
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,200
I humiliated myself in front
of that lier Sigismund!

654
01:13:37,360 --> 01:13:39,555
I thought he was a Christian,
just like me.

655
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:42,439
I thought we'd need one another
in front of our ennemy.

656
01:13:42,640 --> 01:13:45,438
I was wrong.
We have an old saying:

657
01:13:46,480 --> 01:13:49,916
"Better an enemy,
than a friend who's a lier."

658
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:53,149
Where did you find
300 horsemen?

659
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:59,112
I gathered them how I could,
then I bought weapons and horses.

660
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:02,111
Michael...

661
01:14:03,240 --> 01:14:04,878
I want to ask you something.

662
01:14:05,080 --> 01:14:09,437
- Can I do anything for you?
Yes. It's very important.

663
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,675
- I know that...
- Nicolae.

664
01:14:13,880 --> 01:14:18,237
Yes, Nicolae.
Let me take him away!

665
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:22,517
Only God knows how tomorrow
will end.

666
01:14:23,240 --> 01:14:26,437
He's our child.
Your heir.

667
01:14:27,480 --> 01:14:32,190
Go, Stanca! Do what you want!
Maybe it's my fate to be left alone.

668
01:14:33,680 --> 01:14:35,318
The Transylvanians are here.

669
01:14:38,240 --> 01:14:40,117
Count Kiraly!

670
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:42,273
Your Highness...

671
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:45,472
Do you think it was wise to choose
such an uncomfortable place?

672
01:14:45,680 --> 01:14:48,035
How many men did you bring,
Your Excellency?

673
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:49,713
500 Szekely men.

674
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:55,470
My prince and your ruler

675
01:14:57,120 --> 01:15:00,874
is disappointed that he couldn't
bring his army.

676
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:05,073
But he is now in Alba lulia,
where he is celebrating his wedding

677
01:15:05,240 --> 01:15:07,549
with the duchess
Maria Christina of Austria.

678
01:15:07,800 --> 01:15:09,791
500 men?
Is this the promised help?

679
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:14,630
Your Highness, my experience as
a warrior is greater than you think.

680
01:15:15,080 --> 01:15:18,311
I'm fed up with talks
and promises!

681
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:21,995
Father Stoica, show the count
where he can place his men!

682
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:28,470
Milord, I'm knight Tompa.
You can cut my head off,

683
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:30,512
but it's not my fault.

684
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,438
It's that one...
May the Devil take him!

685
01:15:34,520 --> 01:15:37,830
We, the Szekely men,
we'll fight with your 'till death.

686
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,595
We know you.
We heard a lot about your reign.

687
01:15:41,960 --> 01:15:44,474
All right, Tompa. Thank you.

688
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,112
Tomorrow, my sweet wife, you will
see a most wonderful tournament.

689
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:08,155
I hope you'll have enough energy
left, to be a winner.

690
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:17,151
I'm impressed by your cold attitude
in front of all these beauties.

691
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:27,150
You have the most troubling beauty
I've ever seen.

692
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:30,870
I'd give my principality,
in exchange for your good will.

693
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:35,638
Your Highness, in politics,
deceit may be a virtue.

694
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:38,480
In love, though, it's the emblem
of the weak.

695
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:41,552
As beautiful as rich
and merciless!

696
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:46,272
In fact, I'd forgotten your heart
belonged to our valliant Wallachian.

697
01:17:47,240 --> 01:17:49,071
Our vassal...

698
01:17:54,000 --> 01:17:56,594
Poor Kiraly!
Who knows where he is now?

699
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,952
I don't see why we sent him there.
With or without him,

700
01:18:00,120 --> 01:18:02,076
the Wallachians
will lose the battle.

701
01:18:02,240 --> 01:18:04,800
And, if he wins,
who'll rise up to his pride?

702
01:18:05,560 --> 01:18:09,519
Win? How do you think that
the Wallachian could crush Sinan?

703
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,799
Don't get excited, gentlemen!
No matter what the outcome,

704
01:18:15,000 --> 01:18:16,718
we are still the true winners.

705
01:18:16,840 --> 01:18:20,276
- We?
- Your Eminency, we planned it all.

706
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:24,397
Have you forgotten that
the Wallachian is my vassal?

707
01:18:24,760 --> 01:18:29,072
His victory will make the entire
Europe know the bravery of my troops.

708
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,073
If he wins, Sinan will pay dearly.

709
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:36,791
His weakend army will have
less chances in a battle with us.

710
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:41,871
Indeed! He'd even have to build
garrisons in the conquered towns.

711
01:19:12,280 --> 01:19:14,396
Sheikban Pasha!

712
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:19,075
You'll take the command
of the centre.

713
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,556
You'll charge the bridge with
the Janissaries of the first line.

714
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:25,109
It must look like
the ultimate attack.

715
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,360
I'll send the second line
in your support.

716
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:31,512
You'll go on attacking him
1,000 steps beyond the bridge,

717
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:34,473
then you'll fall back,
as if defeated.

718
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:39,478
You must lure the Wallachian
to this other side of the bridge.

719
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,518
Mustafa Pasha!

720
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:48,190
You'll leave the Wallachian 1,000
steps from this side of the bridge.

721
01:19:48,400 --> 01:19:52,359
Then, you'll charge along the river
with your right wing.

722
01:19:57,680 --> 01:20:03,630
Rumelia's armies led by Hassan Pasha
will do the same thing on the left.

723
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,270
Then, we'll catch him in a clasp.

724
01:20:09,520 --> 01:20:11,033
You may go.

725
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:18,958
If the Wallachian crosses the bridge,
he will fall in our trap.

726
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,912
Satargi Pasha, you stay as reserve,
behind the hill.

727
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:30,035
And you, Selim Pasha,
will stay with me.

728
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:32,998
Anything against it?

729
01:20:35,120 --> 01:20:36,678
No, Your Grace.

730
01:21:23,000 --> 01:21:25,389
I haven't seen so many Turks
in all my life.

731
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:27,432
They're like the leaves of grass.

732
01:22:06,040 --> 01:22:10,079
If the Turks cross the bridge,
you strike on the side, to the right.

733
01:22:11,040 --> 01:22:12,678
I'll attack them on the left.

734
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:21,358
Father, you help the pedestrians!
Don't go back a single step!

735
01:22:33,320 --> 01:22:36,551
It is time.
May God help us!

736
01:23:15,160 --> 01:23:18,789
The second line and 20 cannons
will enter the battle.

737
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:31,070
For the bridge, at my command!
Charge!

738
01:23:36,240 --> 01:23:38,390
Follow me, brave men!

739
01:23:57,280 --> 01:23:58,998
Charge!

740
01:24:08,120 --> 01:24:09,269
Give the signal!

741
01:24:45,960 --> 01:24:47,791
Stop!

742
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:52,991
Don't cross the bridge!
It's a trap!

743
01:24:57,840 --> 01:25:01,549
Don't cross the bridge!
Stop!

744
01:25:02,760 --> 01:25:04,478
Do not cross the bridge!

745
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:15,592
The Wallachian is not stupid.
Let all Pashas gather for council!

746
01:25:22,640 --> 01:25:26,394
The Wallachian stopped at the bridge,
but he moved all his troops.

747
01:25:27,560 --> 01:25:29,949
He doesn't have
any hidden armies.

748
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:36,232
Mustafa, you will make a wide detour
with the Anatolian armies.

749
01:25:36,560 --> 01:25:39,791
Then you will cross the Neajlov
and, from the other side,

750
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,639
you'll strike the Wallachian army
on the side.

751
01:25:44,960 --> 01:25:47,269
We'll do the same
on the left side,

752
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:51,354
with Rumelia's armies,
led by Hassan Pasha.

753
01:25:53,680 --> 01:25:56,638
The bridge will be under attack
by the Janissaries and Spahis.

754
01:25:57,000 --> 01:25:58,433
Get going!

755
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:06,108
The first round was a child's trap,
plotted by Sinan.

756
01:26:06,720 --> 01:26:08,790
The true battle begins now.

757
01:26:24,080 --> 01:26:27,834
You'll fight too now, brothers!
I call the Stone troops!

758
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,872
Let's go!

759
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:41,590
The Wallachian engaged
all his forces in battle.

760
01:26:41,840 --> 01:26:44,274
Now's the time for Hassan
and Mustafa to attack.

761
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:47,114
You'll enter the battle
and not give in one step.

762
01:26:50,600 --> 01:26:55,151
Where's Hassan? Where's Mustafa?
I'll cut their heads off!

763
01:26:59,560 --> 01:27:01,312
Mustafa! Charge!

764
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:38,559
Fall back!
You'll go back in order!

765
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,269
In order!

766
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:48,873
We lost. Let's fall back!

767
01:27:49,480 --> 01:27:53,268
What? We came and saw everything,
and now you want us to flea?

768
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:55,795
- I won't do this.
- It's an order.

769
01:27:56,240 --> 01:27:59,949
I won't listen to such orders.
Come with me!

770
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:03,913
Your Spahi seized their cannons.

771
01:28:06,760 --> 01:28:08,591
Where's that stupid Hassan?

772
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,915
This wretched swamp!
We're lost.

773
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:23,713
Let's go round it!

774
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,276
What would you do,
if you were me?

775
01:28:31,760 --> 01:28:34,228
Do you think I'm too old to fight?

776
01:28:34,680 --> 01:28:37,990
You're the one who's helpless,
you with your damaged hand!

777
01:28:40,200 --> 01:28:41,952
It's our turn.

778
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:46,196
Listen carefully!

779
01:28:46,880 --> 01:28:49,155
We can still beat them.

780
01:28:50,880 --> 01:28:56,318
Brothers Buzesti... And you!
You will attack on the centre.

781
01:28:57,160 --> 01:28:59,594
I'll come on the shore,
towards the bridge.

782
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:02,037
And you, Cocea...

783
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:08,191
There's a hard time
ahead of you.

784
01:29:27,640 --> 01:29:31,315
All I ask of you is follow me!
Don't you forget!

785
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:35,395
It's better to have an enemy
in the ground, than in our country!

786
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,358
Follow me!

787
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:30,959
What?

788
01:30:31,200 --> 01:30:34,749
Your Grace... The Wallachian
leads new troops.

789
01:30:34,960 --> 01:30:36,791
They attacked us from one side
at the bridge.

790
01:30:36,920 --> 01:30:38,638
Shut up, you fool!

791
01:30:39,200 --> 01:30:41,316
It's his last breath! Fight on!

792
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:50,473
Fire!

793
01:31:00,880 --> 01:31:04,668
He had less than 300 horsemen.
Charge!

794
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:54,235
- What is this?
- They went to our camp.

795
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:57,433
- We're lost!
- Call the retreat!

796
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:23,910
Don't run away! Wait!

797
01:32:33,720 --> 01:32:35,870
The Turks are running away!
Don't give it up!

798
01:32:36,040 --> 01:32:37,871
Fight, you brothers!

799
01:32:57,280 --> 01:32:59,316
Follow me!

800
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:03,950
Charge!

801
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:12,996
Sinan Pasha!

802
01:33:13,840 --> 01:33:15,796
Sinan Pasha!

803
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:19,114
Sinan!

804
01:34:01,080 --> 01:34:02,832
Victory!

805
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,711
Victory!

806
01:34:44,760 --> 01:34:47,228
Help me, Selim!

807
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:50,950
Can I do it,
with this damaged hand?

808
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,591
Or should I save the sultan's flag?

809
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:56,069
I promise you anything,
if you save me!

810
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,911
Don't stand there!
Help me!

811
01:35:29,680 --> 01:35:30,715
Victory!

812
01:37:01,880 --> 01:37:04,030
Victory!

813
01:37:27,280 --> 01:37:29,589
Your Highness,
I gathered the wounded.

814
01:37:29,880 --> 01:37:33,634
All is ready. There's a wounded Turk
who wants to speak to you.

815
01:37:42,680 --> 01:37:43,795
Hassan?

816
01:37:43,960 --> 01:37:47,191
My name's Ionica, milord.
It will be until I die.

817
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,271
Let me be your faithful servant!

818
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:53,592
Take care of his foot
and treat him with honour!

819
01:37:54,160 --> 01:37:58,153
From now on, I want to see him
at my side. Let's go!

820
01:38:06,320 --> 01:38:09,437
So many dead, milord...
Too many!

821
01:38:10,120 --> 01:38:11,519
I know.

822
01:38:12,520 --> 01:38:16,354
The Romanians will never forget
this battle.

823
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:20,199
Nor will our enemies.

824
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:31,199
